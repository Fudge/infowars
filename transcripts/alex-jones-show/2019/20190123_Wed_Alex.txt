[00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:18.493]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.314]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:43.726]  Well, the whole Nathan Phillips saga with the Covington Catholic School
[00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.190]  Hoax has gone into thermal nuclear meltdown.
[00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:55.774]  And still, when I tune into so-called conservative media or watch Fox News, I see no one playing the tapes.
[00:00:58.415 --> 00:00:59.355]  I've seen it one time.
[00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:06.739]  No one playing any of the tapes of people saying, we're going to harvest your organs, we're going to kill you, go back to Europe, white boy, cracker heads.
[00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:09.174]  All this horrible stuff.
[00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:10.675]  You're there at a bus stop.
[00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.015]  You've been in a pro-life demonstration.
[00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.896]  A bunch of crazy racist minorities come over.
[00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.976]  One of them a professional agitator.
[00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:24.377]  Turns out he was trying to break into a Catholic church and have a protest that very day in D.C.
[00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:25.298]  with 20 other people.
[00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:31.699]  You've got a guy ranging around like Frankenstein harassing people and then here we are
[00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:54.982]  Four and a half days after this has happened, four and a half days after we first pointed out that they marched over into the crowd, and the big corporate media is still basically saying, well, maybe these kids are bad, or maybe their hats are bad, and the young man in question goes on NBC and says, I have every right to stand my ground.
[00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.565]  Well, I don't know if you have that right, they say.
[00:02:00.043 --> 00:02:01.023]  So that's all coming up.
[00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:03.124]  So it's still like they're the bad guys.
[00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:08.447]  And if you look at the town, death threats, protests, lives permanently altered.
[00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.368]  Kentucky town reels after D.C.
[00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:11.868]  face-off.
[00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.970]  Wall Street Journal calls it the high school deplorables.
[00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.871]  They're the bad guys.
[00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:22.693]  Hebrew Israelites see divided, divine intervention in confrontation.
[00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:28.736]  NBC host slammed by the left-right over interview with student.
[00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.131]  Twitter is two minutes of hate.
[00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:34.052]  And it goes on from there.
[00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:36.893]  At DrudgeReport.com.
[00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:41.174]  We also have those articles posted at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:02:42.674 --> 00:02:44.595]  And there's so much other big news, obviously.
[00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:46.915]  Venezuela is melting down.
[00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:54.157]  We've got the economy slowing for the first time in two plus years because of the ongoing shutdown.
[00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:59.837]  And I really sit back and think, shouldn't Trump have just declared a national emergency?
[00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.601]  Oh, but he got convinced not to do it.
[00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.701]  He was going to do it.
[00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:08.505]  My prediction did not fail before he was ever talking about it.
[00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:15.971]  I said he should declare an emergency, and then when he was, we told you, but they backed off.
[00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:25.307]  So we're gonna be discussing all of this today and I'm not saying Trump's wrong to be in whatever day 30 or whatever it is of the shutdown.
[00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:34.240]  It's just that economically in a lot of other areas it gives the Democrats what they want the economy imploding.
[00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.085]  So they're calling for that.
[00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:37.926]  They want that.
[00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:45.492]  They understand that's one way nationalism and capitalism is successful, is because people can feed themselves, unlike socialism or communism.
[00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:48.875]  And so, what Trump's doing with the shutdown is the right thing to do.
[00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:58.142]  But in this game of pissing contest, 32 days, 12 hours, 3 minutes, 41 seconds in, declare the emergency!
[00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:03.329]  Oh, but it would take the funds for the new West Point facility.
[00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.235]  And he goes and gives a speech and says, do you want our borders secured or do you care if you're not in the brand new barracks for a couple years?
[00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:11.997]  They go, we don't want the barracks secure in the country!
[00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:22.787]  Oh, but the Democrats, the military is in to get their fancy new barracks and we're not going to get... People get what is emergency and what isn't.
[00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:24.469]  People get what comes first.
[00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:34.785]  If the door has been blown off its hinges, or your windows have been blown out, you don't paint the inside of the house first, before you fix the windows and the door.
[00:04:36.727 --> 00:04:37.187]  Exactly.
[00:04:38.168 --> 00:04:48.516]  Or, if you've got two children in a car wreck, and one of your children just has a cut above their eye, and the other child is crushed, screaming with blood squirting out, which one do you help first?
[00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:50.558]  The one screaming with blood spewing everywhere.
[00:04:51.278 --> 00:04:51.839]  It's called triage.
[00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:54.461]  You get the tourniquet around them, then you move on to the next.
[00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:56.974]  Our damn legs are cut off!
[00:04:56.994 --> 00:04:58.040]  The border's wide open!
[00:04:58.302 --> 00:04:59.409]  Shut the son of a bitch!
[00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:09.422]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:05:09.782 --> 00:05:15.685]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:28.211]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:35.414]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:43.364]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[00:05:45.285 --> 00:05:51.250]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.131]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:56.554]  Perk up with Turbo Force at infowarstore.com.
[00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.250]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:27.532]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Wednesday, January 23rd, 2019, Global Transmission.
[00:06:38.737 --> 00:06:40.719]  The Globalists are meeting at Davos.
[00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.943]  Our reporter Dan Lyman is reporting from the mountaintop fortress, The Keep.
[00:06:46.204 --> 00:07:00.977]  We are also going to be talking to a botanist and researcher who's exposed the dangers of DMT and other hallucinogens being pushed by CIA front groups and how his interview here with us a few days ago
[00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:13.431]  That's right, you don't talk about how super hallucinogens that can kill you, like ayahuasca, shouldn't be given to children.
[00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:23.479]  That's a community guidelines violation, just like not having seven-year-olds with naked men in gay magazines is violating community standards if you don't keep it in there.
[00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:29.945]  Or if you don't teach five-year-olds how to give blowjobs, you're violating community standards on YouTube.
[00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:30.386]  Seriously.
[00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:31.807]  Pedophilia is everywhere on there.
[00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:37.091]  But if you tell kids don't use hardcore deadly drugs, then you're a community violator.
[00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:39.532]  So we're going to go back over that with him for 30 minutes today.
[00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:49.119]  And then we have a very interesting guest, MMA fighter, a world champion kickboxer, who's been demonized himself in the press as toxically masculine.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.360]  And that's Andrew Tate.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.141]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:52.402]  And I do intend to also
[00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:58.341]  We're going to open the phones up throughout this hour, and I'm talking about by the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:02.683]  I'm going to start going right to your calls specifically on two big issues.
[00:08:02.723 --> 00:08:08.366]  You can call it about other stuff if you want, but I would really like you to humor me because I think this is what we're all focused on the shutdown.
[00:08:09.987 --> 00:08:10.987]  And on the whole.
[00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:20.432]  Covington Catholic kids hoax that the media ran and the new way the corporate media is trying to manage that.
[00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:22.232]  We're gonna be looking at that,
[00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:25.553]  Revealing to say the least.
[00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:27.495]  So we're going to be discussing those different angles.
[00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:31.739]  We're going to look at what's happening with the world economy.
[00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:37.343]  And again, I appreciate the president being a stalwart.
[00:08:37.864 --> 00:08:41.007]  I appreciate the president standing firm on the wall.
[00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:49.034]  I appreciate the president exposing the fact that Democrats just six, seven years ago
[00:08:50.484 --> 00:09:03.760]  Approved border packages that then never got passed through the Senate, but they did approve them in the House, that gave roughly double the border wall funding that Trump's asking for, and basically agree with everything he's saying.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.906]  And everybody's seen the Obama clips and the Hillary clips, where they sound way more hardcore than Trump.
[00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:13.427]  But now they want total open border, UN model, collapse the borders.
[00:09:13.948 --> 00:09:15.330]  And so now they're acting like it's unreasonable.
[00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.937]  So, the president's right that they're the ones that have caused the shutdown.
[00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:21.520]  And he's right that they've refused his
[00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:24.611]  We're good to go.
[00:09:52.554 --> 00:09:54.816]  They also add to it, America was never great.
[00:09:54.896 --> 00:09:56.017]  It'll never be that great.
[00:09:57.158 --> 00:09:58.299]  So that's what they do.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.781]  That's how they operate.
[00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:18.497]  But that said, the true action under the Constitution and under previous executive orders that are constitutional, many of them aren't, but under standard set law, law that's not being debated, the president has the duty, not just the right, to secure our southern border.
[00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:22.430]  With a national emergency, and to take whatever funds he needs.
[00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:40.103]  Well, lots of Democrat bitching and complaining ensued, and a few Republicans said, well, don't take the rebuilding of this army barracks from our state, or don't take building a new medical center from this Navy facility away, or don't take this other remodeling of West Point.
[00:10:41.544 --> 00:10:42.145]  I'm gonna say it again.
[00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:57.150]  If your legs are cut off, and your country's bleeding out, and thousands of armed men are coming across, and jihadis, and kidnapped children, and trillions in drugs every decade, you put tourniquets on the leg.
[00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.112]  So it's like saying, remodel West Point.
[00:11:00.172 --> 00:11:03.534]  That's a bandana that West Point wants to festoon on their head.
[00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:09.538]  And I don't think West Point's going to mind if we take the bandana and say, we're going to use that as a tourniquet.
[00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:20.033]  And again, if Trump went to West Point, if he did an emergency and took the money, for now, from the new barracks to build a wall, he'd say, how many of you agree?
[00:11:20.053 --> 00:11:35.864]  I know I'm your Commander-in-Chief and I can do what's right and I was elected to do this, but how many of you agree with me that you cannot have a new barracks for a few years and secure our border and secure all that child smuggling and all the murder and death and the 200,000 that have been killed down the border in just the last decade?
[00:11:36.044 --> 00:11:37.165]  How many of you agree with me?
[00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:39.467]  You'd have a unanimous cheering.
[00:11:42.315 --> 00:11:50.219]  But instead, the Republican advisors came to him and said, sir, sir, he can get money in an emergency however he wants.
[00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:54.841]  He can order the Treasury to issue new bonds.
[00:11:55.521 --> 00:11:57.842]  What do you think they did in 2008 during the crisis?
[00:11:58.363 --> 00:12:00.304]  So he doesn't even need to take the money from the barracks.
[00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:00.464]  See?
[00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:04.839]  There's lies, within lies, within lies, within lies.
[00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:06.159]  That's why I get so frustrated.
[00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:10.402]  Because you look at one article, and on its face, well, can he declare an emergency?
[00:12:10.622 --> 00:12:12.783]  Of course he can, when the border's wide open.
[00:12:12.963 --> 00:12:14.444]  That's expressly when you do it.
[00:12:14.824 --> 00:12:16.045]  That's one of the few reasons you do it.
[00:12:16.345 --> 00:12:19.587]  Enemy invasion, attack, or collapse refugees.
[00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:21.328]  That's it.
[00:12:22.948 --> 00:12:23.709]  But it doesn't even matter.
[00:12:23.929 --> 00:12:25.690]  Then they start the debate about, well, where's he going to get the money?
[00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.260]  He can have the Treasury do whatever he wants.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.361]  It's all fiat anyways.
[00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:34.923]  It's $5.6 billion.
[00:12:37.104 --> 00:12:47.810]  That is chicken feed compared to what the globalists waste every week in all their corruption.
[00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.572]  And if we don't shore the country up, we're going to collapse.
[00:12:50.992 --> 00:12:53.373]  Last night I met with some pretty big Hollywood producers.
[00:12:53.393 --> 00:12:54.214]  I'm not going to name any names.
[00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:57.803]  And they said, no, you're right.
[00:12:58.103 --> 00:12:58.304]  L.A.
[00:12:58.364 --> 00:12:59.225]  is unlivable now.
[00:12:59.305 --> 00:13:00.386]  They're not fixing anything.
[00:13:01.327 --> 00:13:04.711]  There's homeless people and illegal aliens wandering around everywhere like day of the dead.
[00:13:05.692 --> 00:13:07.394]  It's on fire half the time.
[00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:11.759]  It's hell on earth and everyone we know is moving to Texas.
[00:13:14.554 --> 00:13:18.898]  That's what Democrats create, and now they want more of the tens of millions coming up.
[00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.159]  The very worst.
[00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:24.443]  People with no jobs, pre-existing conditions, mentally ill, criminal records.
[00:13:24.523 --> 00:13:26.184]  It's not that the Mexicans are all criminals.
[00:13:26.464 --> 00:13:28.706]  Trump said they're sending their worst.
[00:13:31.469 --> 00:13:33.290]  Latin America is sending its worst.
[00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:38.235]  And everybody is freaking out in California going, what's going on?
[00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:44.712]  Well, you gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet, and this is the takedown of the United States.
[00:13:46.294 --> 00:13:49.859]  And so Trump is just pragmatically doing a decent job, but here's the bottom line.
[00:13:51.501 --> 00:13:52.082]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:13:55.473 --> 00:14:03.519]  He had never been in office and that's a good thing, but it's also a bad thing because he does good policies, but then they lie to him about how the government works and run circles around him.
[00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:05.320]  He should have declared the emergency.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.521]  It's the proper thing to do.
[00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:12.526]  He could have ordered the Treasury to produce the bonds and people say, oh, but Congress does the...
[00:14:14.007 --> 00:14:15.167]  Congress controls the purse.
[00:14:15.507 --> 00:14:18.749]  They handed it over to the private Federal Reserve and the executive.
[00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:21.311]  They advocated their responsibility a long time ago.
[00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:25.713]  My point is, the President can shut down military operations like he's been doing.
[00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:28.374]  $100 billion a year in Afghanistan we spend.
[00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:29.975]  $100 billion on average.
[00:14:30.516 --> 00:14:30.816]  Boom!
[00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:41.902]  There's 20 times the money we need right there to build the stupid wall.
[00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.892]  So, that's the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:56.978]  And so, the President has all these ways to skin a cat, and he can use the military funding to do it, and he should have done it!
[00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:03.723]  So, I told you they were looking at an emergency, they decided to do it, they said they were going to do it, and then he backed off.
[00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:11.889]  So when it comes time for Trump to really execute with his canines,
[00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:15.684]  To really bite into it every time he backs off.
[00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:18.826]  Didn't release the secret document showing he was illegally spied on.
[00:15:18.846 --> 00:15:19.686]  They perjured themselves.
[00:15:20.967 --> 00:15:21.407]  Didn't do it.
[00:15:22.647 --> 00:15:29.170]  A lot of these things he says he'll do, right when it comes to the final edge of the situation, he isn't doing it.
[00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:32.572]  And so, hey, we'll see who's right about this in the end.
[00:15:34.218 --> 00:15:34.298]  The
[00:16:09.394 --> 00:16:12.629]  We've spent two years...
[00:16:14.249 --> 00:16:23.835]  And had to pay top formulators and scientists from the top labs in the country to make what they believed was the best energy drink replacement.
[00:16:23.996 --> 00:16:25.597]  Energy drinks are bad, on average.
[00:16:25.697 --> 00:16:35.043]  So we had the top formulator and the top natural health guru that advises the Olympic Committee, the NFL, you name it, that'd pay him a lot of money, too.
[00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:44.189]  And we had other groups go double-check it because I said, if the average energy drink has 30 cents of product that's actually energy and a bunch of sugar and crap and no minerals or vitamins,
[00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:50.103]  I said, what would happen if we sold something for $50 and it had $20 of product in it?
[00:16:50.123 --> 00:16:52.710]  And they said, that's not even done.
[00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.532]  That's impossible.
[00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:56.232]  It's just not, it's not done.
[00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:58.374]  So you have to understand how my brain works.
[00:16:58.414 --> 00:17:00.895]  How, how, how, how I operate.
[00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:08.700]  I said, I want the strongest, most powerful, cleanest, healthiest system with all of the key upload enzymes in it.
[00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:22.390]  Because the body, it doesn't matter how much energy drink you drink after a while, it depletes vitamins and minerals and cofactors and key chemicals that are needed to actually get it through the blood, through the blood-brain barrier, and to the cells in a healthy way without the crash.
[00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.913]  So imagine if there was an energy drink without the crash.
[00:17:26.333 --> 00:17:30.556]  Imagine if there was an energy drink without the toxicity and the sugar and all the garbage.
[00:17:30.977 --> 00:17:37.903]  Imagine if there was an energy drink that actually had everything that was really a vitamin and mineral fusion with everything else.
[00:17:37.943 --> 00:17:39.244]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:39.344 --> 00:17:42.006]  And I'll tell you right now that it is next level.
[00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:42.787]  TurboForce.
[00:17:43.067 --> 00:17:59.859]  Energy, metabolism, alertness, and if you look at the back of the box, it goes into everything it's got, ladies and gentlemen, and it's got the herbal energy blend that are all these different types of naturally occurring systems within chemicals that are naturally occurring in the plants to help upload it naturally, and it's all there.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:05.804]  This is someone going to a bunch of top research, we went to four different groups, and saying, give us your plan of the
[00:18:06.224 --> 00:18:10.245]  Next level muscle car in natural, healthy energy.
[00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:14.687]  And again, RainForce Plus is mainly a nootropic with a little bit of clean energy.
[00:18:14.747 --> 00:18:15.347]  People love it.
[00:18:15.507 --> 00:18:19.908]  This is ultimate pre-workout, but ultimate start your day or take in the middle of the day.
[00:18:20.108 --> 00:18:23.029]  I, quite frankly, RainForce works so good on me, I can barely take it.
[00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:26.050]  But I like to stay up all night because it goes to and pop one at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.770]  I'm good at midnight.
[00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.430]  I'm up all night.
[00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.291]  And then I go to sleep and don't crash from it the next day.
[00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:39.654]  So this complements Brain Force Plus, but this is a packet form, and quite frankly, I said make it one of the strongest out there on the market, but make it clean and make it good.
[00:18:40.814 --> 00:18:51.757]  Most people, I would suggest you take a quarter packet the first time you take it, because when we got prototypes of this a few months ago in, everyone was bouncing off the walls, and we can't even believe this is legal.
[00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:53.818]  Bouncing off the walls.
[00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:58.639]  Because it has a spectrum of every natural form of caffeine there is.
[00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:04.102]  Stuff that has a 4-hour burn rate, a 3-hour burn rate, a 2-hour burn rate, a 1-hour burn rate.
[00:19:04.202 --> 00:19:09.465]  It's got all of these different enzymes that upload it, so you get a way bigger response.
[00:19:09.645 --> 00:19:10.405]  I think this is good.
[00:19:10.926 --> 00:19:13.947]  And I'm proud of it, and you'll use it responsibly.
[00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:18.510]  But I said, give us the most powerful, clean, healthy thing, but in this genre.
[00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.631]  And I cannot believe we even produced this.
[00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:22.532]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:19:22.772 --> 00:19:24.013]  Turbo Force, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:26.134]  I mean, I think you should put a half in your water first.
[00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:28.815]  Why don't you get up in the morning and try this instead of your coffee?
[00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:32.696]  It's hard to even get into why this is so good because there's so many ingredients.
[00:19:32.916 --> 00:19:34.997]  I mean, there's just a ton of ingredients in this, baby.
[00:19:35.137 --> 00:19:35.937]  A ton of ingredients.
[00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:38.859]  This took two years to develop, and it's to the moon without a rocket.
[00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:42.520]  So, get your first run of Turbo Force 33% off at Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.261]  Turbo Force, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:45.041]  No reviews yet.
[00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:45.041]  $39.95.
[00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.601]  Blows away everything on the planet.
[00:19:46.701 --> 00:19:48.062]  This is the ultimate.
[00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:09.074]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:45.854 --> 00:20:49.457]  Trump must exercise his power.
[00:20:50.257 --> 00:20:53.299]  Trump must declare a national emergency.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:03.967]  Trump must end the government shutdown or he's going to be outmaneuvered and defeated by the Democrats because it's their goal to plunge the U.S.
[00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:04.407]  economy.
[00:21:04.427 --> 00:21:06.849]  They've admitted it to kill the American recovery.
[00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:16.913]  So that America has to capitulate to the globalists in this trade war of deindustrialization and demoralization being carried out economically and socially.
[00:21:17.573 --> 00:21:19.293]  Yes, the Democrats are behind the shutdown.
[00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.374]  Yes, they're not being reasonable.
[00:21:20.694 --> 00:21:24.855]  Yes, he's only asking for half the money that Democrats voted for eight years ago.
[00:21:25.715 --> 00:21:26.675]  The very same Democrats.
[00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:31.596]  Yes, the President's in the right, technically, and I'm still supporting
[00:21:32.622 --> 00:21:37.645]  But the emergency that his expert advisors told him to declare is the right thing to do.
[00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:40.626]  It circumvents killing the economy.
[00:21:41.787 --> 00:21:46.129]  It takes $5 billion out of the emergency military budget that can be put back in very easily later.
[00:21:46.749 --> 00:21:51.011]  And it gets the prioritization of border defenses in place.
[00:21:52.872 --> 00:22:01.337]  And it's that major miscalculation by the president with his other advisors that has now put us in the position of a sinking economy and the prospect of no growth in this quarter potentially.
[00:22:02.537 --> 00:22:06.198]  Giving the Democrats, in the end, the win they wanted to have.
[00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:11.280]  It's a strategic defeat, so far.
[00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:14.161]  I hope it gets turned around.
[00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:16.982]  Declare the emergency, President Trump.
[00:22:17.362 --> 00:22:18.803]  Do your duty.
[00:22:21.744 --> 00:22:21.864]  Now,
[00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:26.128]  I have a bunch of clips documenting this from the news we're going to get to.
[00:22:26.148 --> 00:22:27.228]  Then I'm going to give the number out.
[00:22:27.248 --> 00:22:30.709]  We're going to start taking your phone calls in this hour, right into the next hour.
[00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:32.429]  Then we have several guests joining us after that.
[00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.350]  Am I right about this?
[00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.031]  Or what do you think about the shutdown 32 days in, 12 hours?
[00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:52.075]  What do you think about the Catholic school, Covington group, and how four days into this, four and a half days into this, on Saturday, InfoWars was one of the first.
[00:22:53.302 --> 00:22:54.882]  Just pointing out, man, we're at the parapets.
[00:22:54.902 --> 00:22:56.343]  We're at the door.
[00:22:56.383 --> 00:22:57.003]  We're at the gate.
[00:22:57.063 --> 00:22:58.943]  We're at the bridge, man.
[00:22:58.963 --> 00:23:00.103]  We're burning the home fires.
[00:23:00.143 --> 00:23:02.044]  We're eagle-eyed, man.
[00:23:02.744 --> 00:23:03.384]  We're in this fight.
[00:23:03.404 --> 00:23:04.304]  That's why we need your support.
[00:23:06.444 --> 00:23:07.764]  Coming up, I'm going to get into all that.
[00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:10.885]  Where it's like, are they bad or are they good?
[00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:12.985]  That's what mainstream media, NBC, is now saying.
[00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.706]  And these kids go on there.
[00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:18.646]  NBC does a fair interview, but still a whitewash.
[00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:22.027]  And they get demonized by the left.
[00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:30.862]  Hey, NBC, why don't you show people saying, we're gonna kill you and cut your organs out, you white piece of crap, you cracker piece of crap.
[00:23:31.062 --> 00:23:32.303]  You want me to play all the clips again?
[00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:49.157]  We've got 20 minutes of insults and cussing, and the kids trying to get away to the bus stop, and then, the poor, wonderful, Rambo, Vietnam commando, elder chief big wampum,
[00:23:51.914 --> 00:23:57.919]  Marches over and gets in their face, and the whole corporate press cuts the tape, edits it, and lies because they're the enemy of the people.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:11.470]  And on no channels that I've seen, except one little clip on one national channel, do they point out that they marched over to them, got in their face and said, get out of here white people, we don't like you.
[00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.331]  We'll cut your organs out.
[00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.773]  We'll kill you!
[00:24:18.587 --> 00:24:25.870]  And in this upside-down world, no one will play the clips, no one will defend them, and the kids don't even point it out when they're on television.
[00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.971]  Their statement was the first to say it.
[00:24:28.331 --> 00:24:35.273]  They called them fags, they called them homos, they called them incest babies, they called them mass shooters, they told them they were gonna die!
[00:24:35.293 --> 00:24:37.154]  This is all on tape!
[00:24:39.035 --> 00:24:42.336]  And only places like this will you see it.
[00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:47.038]  In fact, I want a master compilation put together now.
[00:24:49.672 --> 00:24:50.913]  Pick somebody, do it.
[00:24:51.013 --> 00:24:52.653]  I want the insults all in there.
[00:24:54.694 --> 00:24:55.694]  Because we're going to air it again.
[00:24:55.714 --> 00:24:57.055]  Because we've got a bunch of different ones.
[00:24:57.115 --> 00:24:58.896]  By the time we play them all, some of it overlaps.
[00:24:58.976 --> 00:25:00.076]  I want to get that together.
[00:25:00.136 --> 00:25:01.217]  I want to hammer that out.
[00:25:01.317 --> 00:25:07.559]  I want to force it on the web and ask all the listeners today, get it out to everyone you know.
[00:25:16.075 --> 00:25:22.778]  And again, NBC put a tiny clip of them calling them a couple names in there, and NBC's being attacked for supporting KKK Nazis.
[00:25:23.378 --> 00:25:26.960]  Because now if you say, Make America Great Again, you're bad.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.560]  Well guess what?
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.582]  All the areas where people wear the red hats is where everybody wants to get into.
[00:25:32.602 --> 00:25:33.502]  Because you know what?
[00:25:33.822 --> 00:25:35.683]  That's where people work 12-14 hours a day.
[00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:39.805]  That's where we still fly Old Glory down at the courthouse.
[00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:43.457]  You can make fun of being square all day.
[00:25:43.778 --> 00:25:50.203]  Most of us that are square have not been square at some point and figured out it's a lot better being square than being twisted.
[00:25:51.584 --> 00:25:55.447]  Being a drug addict, or being a pervert, or being a weirdo, or being a criminal.
[00:25:56.508 --> 00:25:57.729]  Yeah, you're damn right I'm square.
[00:25:57.749 --> 00:25:59.350]  I'm squared away pretty good.
[00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:00.851]  I'm not perfect.
[00:26:01.592 --> 00:26:02.793]  I want to get squared away more.
[00:26:04.394 --> 00:26:05.295]  What's squared away mean?
[00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:06.536]  Just goes back to old naval terms.
[00:26:06.576 --> 00:26:07.957]  It means you got your crap together.
[00:26:09.343 --> 00:26:10.703]  And you got everything where it's supposed to be.
[00:26:10.743 --> 00:26:11.784]  You know what's going on.
[00:26:11.924 --> 00:26:13.824]  You got your head screwed on straight!
[00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:25.907]  But they want your head all screwed on crooked because the globalists want to sell us on a massive total bill of goods.
[00:26:28.528 --> 00:26:29.268]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.441]  We're going to go to break.
[00:26:32.461 --> 00:26:33.441]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:34.382]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:26:34.402 --> 00:26:39.907]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[00:26:39.927 --> 00:26:40.448]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:26:41.028 --> 00:26:41.729]  First-time callers.
[00:26:42.249 --> 00:26:45.332]  Or students that want to call in and give us your take on what you witnessed.
[00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:52.599]  Or people that think, you know, that the godlike Native American getting in the kid's face is a good person and we should all bow down to him.
[00:26:53.099 --> 00:26:53.740]  It's a free-for-all.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.500]  Agree, disagree.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.602]  It's your chance to call in on all these issues.
[00:26:56.883 --> 00:26:58.144]  Should Trump declare an emergency,
[00:26:58.664 --> 00:27:05.366]  Where do you see the shutdown going?
[00:27:05.386 --> 00:27:06.427]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:06.447 --> 00:27:11.429]  877-789-2539 is the number for you to call in.
[00:27:12.369 --> 00:27:13.469]  That said, we're going to break.
[00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.991]  I would just ask listeners to remember, if you don't spread the word about the broadcast,
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:30.086]  If you don't tell neighbors and friends and church and your email list and then text out the live feed, Infowars.com forward slash show and say, Hey, here's the verboten show.
[00:27:30.406 --> 00:27:31.687]  Here's what they don't want you to hear.
[00:27:31.947 --> 00:27:33.088]  Here's what they're demonizing.
[00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:34.669]  Here's what they lie about constantly.
[00:27:35.609 --> 00:27:38.611]  They will be successful deplatforming us and shutting us down.
[00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:40.332]  Now you've stayed vigilant.
[00:27:40.352 --> 00:27:45.255]  You've been pushing the site and you've been helping us get it out there, but
[00:27:47.023 --> 00:27:50.428]  If you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:54.854]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:54.974 --> 00:27:55.955]  Get that link out to everybody.

[00:28:14.104 --> 00:28:22.566]  We have super male vitality, super female vitality that have been our number one bestseller, but we've had to discontinue because it's wild crafted and too hard for them to be able to get and process and produce.
[00:28:23.487 --> 00:28:33.281]  It's probably the last run we're working on still being able to get it, but this is the last run right now and it's 50% off because I still want you to have a chance to try it.
[00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:38.329]  But regardless, it's your purchases that make everything we do here possible.
[00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:41.151]  And we have our newest product that I believe will become our number one bestseller.
[00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:42.712]  It complements BrainForce.
[00:28:43.233 --> 00:28:44.214]  It's TurboForce.
[00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:46.676]  It's beyond energy drinks.
[00:28:46.776 --> 00:28:48.417]  It's beyond pre-workout.
[00:28:48.497 --> 00:28:50.198]  It's beyond nootropic.
[00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:53.741]  It is the most powerful total formula out there.
[00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:54.842]  TurboForce.
[00:28:55.383 --> 00:28:56.544]  At InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:28:56.944 --> 00:28:57.664]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:57.685 --> 00:28:58.045]  Stay with us.
[00:29:02.895 --> 00:29:11.382]  Now to the outrage over a video showing an encounter between teenagers and a Native American veteran near the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:16.467]  Outrage is growing this afternoon over students who mocked a Native American Vietnam veteran.
[00:29:16.487 --> 00:29:19.409]  A video that is causing outrage for so many.
[00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:26.835]  A Kentucky Catholic high school is facing backlash after footage of students mocking a Native American elder appeared online.
[00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:28.716]  The videos have drawn outrage.
[00:29:29.377 --> 00:29:29.677]  Outrage.
[00:29:29.777 --> 00:29:30.178]  Outrage.
[00:29:30.278 --> 00:29:31.719]  Outrage from all corners.
[00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:34.060]  Here's the video sparking outrage on social media.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.981]  Sparked outrage on social media.
[00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:43.747]  A group of teenagers, many wearing Make America Great Again hats, were caught on video taunting a Native American Vietnam veteran.
[00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:53.973]  We are hearing from a Native American elder and Vietnam War veteran speaking to CNN after a disturbing viral video shows a group of teens harassing and mocking him in the nation's capital.
[00:29:59.657 --> 00:30:02.518]  Harassing a Native American elder in Washington.
[00:30:02.778 --> 00:30:10.561]  Ben Phillips describes the tense moments now being replayed over and over again online when a young man got right in his face.
[00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:11.101]  Watch.
[00:30:11.361 --> 00:30:16.723]  Nathan Phillips was beating his drum and singing an American Indian protest song.
[00:30:16.943 --> 00:30:28.832]  When I was there, and I was standing there, and I seen that group of people in front of me, and I seen the angry faces and all of that, I realized I had put myself in a really dangerous situation.
[00:30:29.012 --> 00:30:39.920]  One young man is captured in a tense moment, now being replayed online, getting right in his face, and mocking his singing and drumming on the day of the Indigenous Peoples March.
[00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:45.785]  A moment from the march has gone viral, an interaction between Native marchers and a group of high school students.
[00:30:45.925 --> 00:30:49.087]  Videos of the encounter shared widely on social media.
[00:30:49.487 --> 00:30:52.489]  Swiss backlash against the behavior of those Kentucky teens.
[00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:53.590]  You see a lot of red in this.
[00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.810]  You see a lot of the MAGA hats.
[00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.432]  The smile on his face shows how little respect he had for what he was witnessing.
[00:30:58.452 --> 00:31:10.940]  Clearly these boys are not getting a good education because it makes little sense to angrily chant build the wall to a population with literally zero illegal immigrants who were here long before we were.
[00:31:13.294 --> 00:31:16.857]  Hollywood film producer Jack Morrissey tweeted that he wanted the boys killed.
[00:31:16.877 --> 00:31:20.320]  I got kids go screaming hot furs.
[00:31:23.244 --> 00:31:25.405]  I know this will come as a huge shock to all of you.
[00:31:25.725 --> 00:31:29.505]  This entire exchange was completely misrepresented in the media.
[00:31:29.545 --> 00:31:32.946]  Left-wing media, of course, claimed that these students were harassing this Native American Indian.
[00:31:32.986 --> 00:31:35.567]  Turns out it was exactly the opposite.
[00:31:35.607 --> 00:31:39.447]  Here's what the mainstream media refused to tell you happened before the exchange.
[00:31:39.827 --> 00:31:41.588]  Look at all these dusty-ass cracks.
[00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:43.768]  Put that racist garbage on.
[00:31:43.788 --> 00:31:45.228]  Look at these dirty-ass cracks.
[00:31:45.328 --> 00:31:47.689]  Ain't gonna be no peace until blood is shed.
[00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:53.294]  I get a little angry looking at this guy who's gone on CNN and everywhere else and what a big victim he is.
[00:31:53.474 --> 00:31:56.817]  When he's with a group screaming, we're gonna kill you!
[00:31:56.837 --> 00:32:02.702]  So the media ran a completely fake news story which resulted in children being threatened with murder.
[00:32:02.762 --> 00:32:07.906]  Today, the Catholic school at the center of that viral confrontation on Capitol Hill forced to close.
[00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:15.253]  Students now facing death threats, being smeared as racist over video of a clash with a Native American protester at the March for Life.
[00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:19.416]  People are calling now for the students to be killed, their school to be burned down, them to be shot.
[00:32:19.436 --> 00:32:21.058]  Twitter's leaving it up, agrees with it.
[00:32:21.078 --> 00:32:23.800]  I heard him saying, build that wall, build that wall.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.223]  It makes little sense to angrily chant, build the wall.
[00:32:27.263 --> 00:32:28.283]  None of that is true.
[00:32:28.343 --> 00:32:32.707]  We went through the entire video and did not hear a single student chanting, build that wall.
[00:32:32.747 --> 00:32:35.709]  There is no evidence at all that anybody said, build the wall.
[00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:38.512]  This is the anatomy of how the left always are professional victims.
[00:32:38.552 --> 00:32:40.753]  The left-wing media is actually
[00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:53.603]  ...intending to incite violence, intending to incite a civil war, and is functioning, frankly, as enemy combatants in a civil war that they have already started.
[00:32:59.567 --> 00:33:00.288]  InfoWars.
[00:33:00.648 --> 00:33:02.289]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:06.493 --> 00:33:09.114]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.589 --> 00:33:16.289]  Big Brother.
[00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.970]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.511]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:21.832]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:22.092 --> 00:33:23.232]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.773 --> 00:33:28.795]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:53.016]  The big subjects we're talking about is the territorial integrity of Western nation-states, with the UN building refugee centers in the poorest, most socialist and communist countries, and then opening up migration routes up to refugee centers on the US
[00:33:54.335 --> 00:33:54.735]  A border.
[00:33:55.036 --> 00:34:03.121]  And borders in Europe, like Macedonia, borders with Turkey, where tens of millions have already purposely flooded Europe.
[00:34:03.821 --> 00:34:04.842]  Now we're being shut up.
[00:34:05.603 --> 00:34:11.507]  Once the first groups broke defenses six years ago in Europe, the UN declared an emergency.
[00:34:11.547 --> 00:34:18.591]  The EU helped open the borders to then bring in second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth waves much, much bigger.
[00:34:19.092 --> 00:34:20.653]  The first few waves were in the 50,000, 100,000 range.
[00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:25.720]  Just like it's hit us in the last few months.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.544]  Well now, Mexico has announced, that's coming up next hour, Mexico has announced that they're easing passage and opening their border.
[00:34:35.164 --> 00:34:39.926]  The UN runs the refugee camp, it's more orderly, the gates open, income 10,000, 20,000 more.
[00:34:39.986 --> 00:34:40.526]  Now on their way.
[00:34:45.182 --> 00:35:00.827]  But don't worry, Jim Acosta says there's no such thing as refugees, there's no such thing as caravans, and when the lady tries to reach for the microphone, he grabs it away and pushes her arm down, and the news says that video's fake.
[00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:11.051]  And they edited the video of the Native American charging in, getting in the face of the young people, but the internet was there to show what really happened.
[00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:19.197]  So see, it's not working where they show Acosta chopping at the lady's arm, and then they say it's not real.
[00:35:19.357 --> 00:35:19.817]  It is real.
[00:35:20.658 --> 00:35:21.438]  It's not doctored.
[00:35:21.498 --> 00:35:22.038]  We zoomed in.
[00:35:23.379 --> 00:35:24.760]  And you're the ones that doctored.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:37.948]  Doctoring is cutting a tape to the end, not showing what happened in 90% of it, and then misrepresenting that the man had been surrounded by the young people from the Catholic school when it was the other way around.
[00:35:40.148 --> 00:35:47.931]  So just an example of how they're trying to get away with all this, but how people more and more are seeing through it, and we're seeing a major tipping point on this.
[00:35:49.332 --> 00:35:50.352]  So we'll get into that as well.
[00:35:50.392 --> 00:35:55.014]  But understand, the Associated Press and others are reporting what Trump said a few weeks ago.
[00:35:55.934 --> 00:36:09.040]  Mexico's gone from saying they'll help defend their own border to, okay, if the UN agrees to pay to have these people shipped up to the US border and they don't stay here, we will allow a full-on invasion.
[00:36:10.267 --> 00:36:12.988]  Now you know what the regular response to that is.
[00:36:13.008 --> 00:36:21.051]  It's for the President to declare an emergency and to put troops into Mexico to take Mexico City if we have to.
[00:36:21.071 --> 00:36:29.974]  Mexico City would fall like that and let them know that we're not going to have Mexico running a territorial war against us.
[00:36:31.615 --> 00:36:34.616]  So this is what we've had to do repeatedly with the Army and the Marines.
[00:36:35.416 --> 00:36:36.397]  And we're at that point again.
[00:36:37.383 --> 00:36:41.830]  The president needs to declare an emergency and tell Mexico, we're not going to invade you.
[00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.094]  We're going to cut your $50 billion in aid off.
[00:36:45.135 --> 00:36:45.816]  You roughly get.
[00:36:47.078 --> 00:36:50.143]  And we're going to put troops 10 miles into Mexico.
[00:36:51.105 --> 00:36:51.565]  And we're going to
[00:36:53.254 --> 00:36:55.055]  Alex, this sounds so militaristic.
[00:36:55.075 --> 00:36:55.956]  We're under attack.
[00:36:55.996 --> 00:36:58.377]  That's what you do when you're under this level of attack.
[00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:01.399]  See, I said I'd get to it next hour, but I'll get into it more.
[00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:21.876]  New caravan grows as Mexico eases passage.
[00:37:22.076 --> 00:37:23.537]  Tijuana prepared.
[00:37:23.557 --> 00:37:26.357]  The Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:28.398 --> 00:37:36.800]  Central Americans crowd Mexico's southern border awaiting humanitarian visas to pass unhindered towards the United States.
[00:37:41.421 --> 00:37:44.962]  But CNN and MSNBC, they said there is no caravan.
[00:37:47.469 --> 00:37:53.372]  Meanwhile, Beto's on the news all the time locally bragging, I just helped to get another 10,000 people in.
[00:37:53.612 --> 00:37:55.033]  He talks kind of like Bernie Sanders.
[00:37:56.614 --> 00:37:58.635]  And we're going to take care of it all for yous!
[00:38:00.856 --> 00:38:03.658]  They don't go live at his house.
[00:38:04.118 --> 00:38:06.419]  So the country as we know it is being killed.
[00:38:06.499 --> 00:38:07.520]  It's being destroyed.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.621]  It's being shut down right now.
[00:38:11.502 --> 00:38:13.423]  By the buck-toothed Bugs Bunny.
[00:38:14.444 --> 00:38:16.865]  Beto and Peto and all the rest of his cohorts.
[00:38:19.147 --> 00:38:21.048]  And so it never ends, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:22.728 --> 00:38:25.069]  The plan to turn America into a bankrupt and third-world country.
[00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:26.789]  We can't pay for all the anchor babies.
[00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.070]  We can't pay for all the city sanitation.
[00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.831]  We can't pay for the shanty towns.
[00:38:31.071 --> 00:38:32.431]  We can't pay for all the corruption.
[00:38:32.451 --> 00:38:38.053]  And I've talked to hardcore liberals in California, and they go, you're right, Alex.
[00:38:38.113 --> 00:38:38.493]  It's hell.
[00:38:38.513 --> 00:38:39.113]  We're all leaving.
[00:38:39.914 --> 00:38:40.294]  You're right.
[00:38:40.334 --> 00:38:40.814]  What do we do?
[00:38:44.235 --> 00:38:46.016]  You do what Bernie Sanders does.
[00:38:46.296 --> 00:38:46.896]  You loot.
[00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:52.406]  Colleges and steal all the money, and you live a million dollar?
[00:38:52.466 --> 00:38:54.007]  That's expensive in Connecticut.
[00:38:54.447 --> 00:39:03.110]  We're talking 10 bedroom, lakefront properties, and you drive 115,000 dollar alleys.
[00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.431]  What's wrong with that?
[00:39:06.651 --> 00:39:11.773]  White people do not know what it is like to be poor.
[00:39:12.785 --> 00:39:19.766]  At least if you're me and never had a paying job in your life till you were 42 years old.
[00:39:21.086 --> 00:39:24.247]  I will get your money, don't you worry, America.
[00:39:27.888 --> 00:39:28.768]  So, there you go.
[00:39:29.648 --> 00:39:30.468]  This is what they do.
[00:39:31.448 --> 00:39:40.830]  There's countless videos on Infowars.com and Newswars.com with our reporters and others on the ground talking to the women's marches in California.
[00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.410]  And let me tell you,
[00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:46.931]  Dumb as a box of rocks doesn't catch it.
[00:39:47.691 --> 00:39:51.254]  It's more like helpless gremlins or something.
[00:39:51.935 --> 00:39:54.057]  Helpless, pissed off, stupid gremlins.
[00:39:54.777 --> 00:40:03.405]  Hopeless, clueless, leaderless, vicious, assaulting people, just getting away with it.
[00:40:04.389 --> 00:40:06.870]  This is what our niceness and our largesse has built.
[00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.071]  Okay, we're going to break and I'm coming right back with your phone calls.
[00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:16.612]  Got a bunch of clips on the economy and how they're trying to plunge it as well with the shutdown and how Trump should have declared the emergency and bypassed all this!
[00:40:17.393 --> 00:40:20.013]  We're losing tens... What's the economy losing?
[00:40:20.033 --> 00:40:21.314]  I saw some number like 10 billion a day.
[00:40:21.334 --> 00:40:30.256]  So we'll have this stupid standoff into day 32 when the president has the power to do his job and declare the emergency and circumvent the jerks in Congress.
[00:40:31.056 --> 00:40:32.977]  Comprende el Presidente!
[00:40:35.424 --> 00:40:37.345]  Seriously, I'm starting to get pissed off at Trump.
[00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:44.349]  Now I know he's a lot better than the foaming at the mouth Democrats, but it isn't good enough!
[00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.770]  Protect us from him!
[00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:46.811]  Do your job!
[00:40:49.533 --> 00:40:50.093]  Stop right there.
[00:40:55.276 --> 00:40:55.997]  Okay, it's true.
[00:40:56.497 --> 00:41:00.040]  I stayed up late last night, so I had half a Turbo Force this morning.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.543]  Half a container, half a packet, and I shouldn't have done it, because I'm already pissed.
[00:41:04.563 --> 00:41:05.304]  It's making me more angry.
[00:41:06.144 --> 00:41:08.226]  And I'll tell you what, I'm feeling a lot of energy.
[00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:09.827]  My brain's sure working good right now.
[00:41:10.628 --> 00:41:12.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's our newest product.
[00:41:13.189 --> 00:41:16.312]  It's Turbo Force from InfoLowForceLife.com.
[00:41:16.972 --> 00:41:20.275]  And let me tell you, it's got all the key amino acids.
[00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:26.103]  The expensive ones, the fancy ones, the ones that the average company won't put in.
[00:41:26.123 --> 00:41:31.348]  They'll put in a bunch of dye, because that gets you high, and a bunch of twisted chemical caffeine that's super cheap.
[00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:45.100]  No, ladies and gentlemen, this is all of these different known healthy systems for the brain, the equivalent of a pre-workout, the equivalent of a
[00:41:46.425 --> 00:41:48.426]  Mind, focus, I don't know what you call it.
[00:41:48.686 --> 00:41:51.226]  It's the healthy energy drink to the next level.
[00:41:51.647 --> 00:42:01.629]  Vitamins, minerals, all the amino acids, 200 milligrams of naturally occurring caffeine, with a bunch of other key compounds that help get it uploaded.
[00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.410]  It's unbelievable.
[00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.091]  You need to go read for yourself what's in Turbo Force.
[00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:11.372]  Ladies and gentlemen, I recommend the first time you take it, you take half a packet.
[00:42:12.532 --> 00:42:14.033]  Because instead of drinking coffee this morning,
[00:42:15.015 --> 00:42:16.557]  At 6 a.m.
[00:42:16.777 --> 00:42:19.139]  I had half a packet of TurboForce.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:29.409]  Again, the regular dose is an entire packet, but it's got so many incredible things in it that you've got to actually take it to experience it.
[00:42:29.489 --> 00:42:32.431]  It's 33% out of the gates at Infowarslife.com.

[00:42:39.901 --> 00:42:41.103]  BrainForce is mainly in Nootropic.
[00:42:41.763 --> 00:42:45.087]  Has a tiny bit of some of the same stimulant that's in here.
[00:42:45.387 --> 00:42:47.349]  All natural, high quality, that God gave us.
[00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:48.891]  This is TurboForce.
[00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:50.112]  BrainForce is awesome.
[00:42:50.792 --> 00:42:54.376]  This is TurboForce at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:43:36.024 --> 00:43:44.591]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:43:46.212 --> 00:43:54.740]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:45:07.497 --> 00:45:08.617]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:45:09.538 --> 00:45:13.800]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:45:14.441 --> 00:45:17.663]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:45:18.263 --> 00:45:26.308]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:45:27.248 --> 00:45:29.669]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[00:45:30.029 --> 00:45:36.612]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:45:37.292 --> 00:45:41.194]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[00:45:41.254 --> 00:45:47.157]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:45:47.217 --> 00:45:50.038]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:45:50.238 --> 00:45:51.479]  Hashtag Alex Jones.

[00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:03.773]  Because we need border security.
[00:46:03.793 --> 00:46:04.533]  We have to have it.
[00:46:04.873 --> 00:46:07.835]  Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[00:46:09.156 --> 00:46:10.136]  And it's gonna happen now.
[00:46:10.616 --> 00:46:11.237]  Gonna happen now.
[00:46:11.257 --> 00:46:12.477]  Thank you very much everybody.
[00:46:13.078 --> 00:46:14.439]  Enjoy your food.
[00:46:14.639 --> 00:46:20.782]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candle stick holders with candles and then all this fast food.
[00:46:20.822 --> 00:46:21.943]  Trump is ridiculous.
[00:46:22.423 --> 00:46:23.904]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:30.123]  But meanwhile, he says we've got burgers stacked a mile high.
[00:46:30.423 --> 00:46:33.304]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[00:46:34.225 --> 00:46:39.808]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners.
[00:46:40.408 --> 00:46:43.950]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him.
[00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.733]  And Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least, when he did.
[00:46:48.753 --> 00:46:49.253]  Oh, it's well known.
[00:46:49.313 --> 00:46:52.715]  Trump likes tacos, and Obama likes wieners.
[00:47:05.983 --> 00:47:12.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:28.052]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.633 --> 00:47:33.694]  Oh, the CDC says 2018 was the worst year yet.
[00:47:35.779 --> 00:47:37.300]  For a paralyzing syndrome!
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.280]  Of course, it's just polio.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.320]  You get it from the vaccine.
[00:47:41.701 --> 00:47:51.104]  All the world, they have live polio in the vaccine, and then they go in, though, and they see antibodies for it, and they say, oh, you don't have polio.
[00:47:51.144 --> 00:47:52.945]  It can't be, because you got the vaccine for that.
[00:47:53.645 --> 00:47:54.885]  And that's the little game they play.
[00:47:55.165 --> 00:47:56.466]  We don't know why you died.
[00:47:56.566 --> 00:47:57.726]  We don't know why you can't breathe.
[00:47:57.966 --> 00:47:59.127]  We don't know why you're paralyzed.
[00:47:59.847 --> 00:48:02.828]  Back in the day, they just told my grandmother, oh, you got it from the vaccine.
[00:48:03.871 --> 00:48:08.973]  She got the second vaccine, she got that strain a week later, and she started having the virus eat her nerves.
[00:48:10.274 --> 00:48:13.635]  And then she got to be on crutches for the rest of her life until she died two years ago.
[00:48:14.996 --> 00:48:17.297]  But that's the way the globalists roll.
[00:48:17.317 --> 00:48:22.339]  And of course, Dr. Salk and others admitted that the polio vaccine killed a bunch of people and gave them cancer.
[00:48:22.379 --> 00:48:24.700]  But hey, that's actual history books.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.361]  You know, stuff like that.
[00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:31.083]  And you know, the people that got killed from it, they're history too, aren't they?
[00:48:32.585 --> 00:48:34.385]  That's the fun part about the New World Order.
[00:48:35.586 --> 00:48:43.267]  We know how bad socialism and communism is, but we've got half a millennial saying they identify as communist, that that's what they want.
[00:48:45.427 --> 00:48:48.788]  Yes, it was called the Salk polio vaccine tragedy.
[00:48:50.028 --> 00:48:54.149]  It was a tragedy that they gave 99 million people in the U.S.
[00:48:54.209 --> 00:48:54.549]  alone.
[00:48:55.769 --> 00:48:56.889]  Cancer, they estimate.
[00:48:57.949 --> 00:48:58.509]  But hey!
[00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.270]  It's the government.
[00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:00.710]  They love you.
[00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.310]  Everything's fine.
[00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:04.894]  All right, I'm going to go to your phone calls now, right into the next hour.
[00:49:04.914 --> 00:49:13.358]  I've got a bunch of news we haven't broken down yet that basically proves what I was saying earlier, that yes, the Democrats are mainly behind the shutdown.
[00:49:13.418 --> 00:49:14.499]  Yes, they're not being reasonable.
[00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:23.884]  Yes, Trump only wants half the money for a border defense that they all voted for but never got passed in the Senate six years ago, seven years ago, eight years ago.
[00:49:23.904 --> 00:49:24.664]  It happened three times.
[00:49:25.185 --> 00:49:29.207]  Yes, yes, they're doing it because they want to plunge the economy.
[00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:31.748]  They think the public's too dumb to know that they're the ones doing it.
[00:49:32.722 --> 00:49:33.662]  But they admit that's the plan.
[00:49:34.002 --> 00:49:39.283]  So why should Trump give them what they want in a 32-day pee-pee contest?
[00:49:39.303 --> 00:49:46.185]  I mean, he was never in a hotel room like Russiagate and The Steel File said in BuzzFeed.
[00:49:46.225 --> 00:49:46.965]  That was fake news.
[00:49:47.245 --> 00:49:51.266]  He was never... Trump was never in a hotel room with hookers urinating on him.
[00:49:51.526 --> 00:49:52.066]  But you know what?
[00:49:52.146 --> 00:49:55.687]  He's in a pee-pee contest with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
[00:49:57.742 --> 00:50:00.424]  The right thing to do is our border is our sovereignty.
[00:50:00.724 --> 00:50:01.624]  It is under attack.
[00:50:01.704 --> 00:50:03.145]  Another giant caravan's coming.
[00:50:03.445 --> 00:50:04.566]  Thousands are hitting every day.
[00:50:04.886 --> 00:50:07.127]  Diseases, drugs, kidnapped children.
[00:50:07.347 --> 00:50:10.489]  The Senate report admits a bunch of kids get smuggled across and disappear.
[00:50:10.769 --> 00:50:14.531]  So these smiling, jackass Democrats are sitting over there.
[00:50:14.932 --> 00:50:16.272]  Use your executive power!
[00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.053]  Declare the national emergency!
[00:50:18.313 --> 00:50:19.414]  That's leadership!
[00:50:19.634 --> 00:50:20.755]  And that's your job!
[00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:30.367]  And I get angry at Trump because he's got a bunch of piss-poor, not-need advisors around him.
[00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:37.113]  Cut the military funding by 20% in Afghanistan.
[00:50:37.133 --> 00:50:38.494]  Don't even pull all the troops out.
[00:50:38.754 --> 00:50:45.420]  And that's $20 billion you can put into the emergency and build something that looks like it's from Escape from New York.
[00:50:49.366 --> 00:50:51.427]  Gosh, what kind of advisors does he have?
[00:50:51.947 --> 00:51:02.891]  Any moron that studied the budget or the power of the presidency or the government's funding or emergency expenditures knows that this president is tied down by a bunch of Lilliputians!
[00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:18.938]  And if he's gonna let a bunch of one-inch tall idiots sell us out to the shycoms and everybody else and let all this foreign invasion happen when he's got the power to stop it, well then Trump can't be saved, can he?
[00:51:20.862 --> 00:51:33.927]  But I'm saying this and doing this, ladies and gentlemen, because it's the truth and people need to call the White House and support the President by getting his attention.
[00:51:36.328 --> 00:51:37.568]  And I am going to go to D.C.
[00:51:37.688 --> 00:51:45.071]  soon and have a march on the White House, a peaceful march, calling for the President to do his job and declare an emergency.
[00:51:45.131 --> 00:51:46.271]  I thought he would have done it by now.
[00:51:47.051 --> 00:51:48.532]  They said he was, but he backed off.
[00:51:50.561 --> 00:52:02.953]  And, I'm going to say it again, now we're going into an economic emergency, because yeah, a lot of the government isn't needed, but some of it is, and it's a big part of the economy, so that money's not flowing out now, and it's giving the Democrats everything they want.
[00:52:03.273 --> 00:52:06.957]  So, they're winning right now with this shutdown.
[00:52:07.758 --> 00:52:10.721]  Oh yeah, there's little tit-for-tats like taking their airplanes away or whatever.
[00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:12.883]  That's all cutesy foot at the end of the day.
[00:52:14.224 --> 00:52:16.165]  The border being wide open.
[00:52:16.586 --> 00:52:18.447]  The illegal aliens and the next wave coming.
[00:52:18.887 --> 00:52:19.168]  All of it.
[00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:20.168]  We gotta get on this now.
[00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:21.970]  The globals are trying to break our border now.
[00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.870]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:23.471]  I apologize.
[00:52:25.512 --> 00:52:29.755]  It is nice seeing Maxine Waters up to fly on an airplane.
[00:52:29.815 --> 00:52:30.856]  But she flies in first class.
[00:52:30.876 --> 00:52:33.498]  You know she flies out to California on a private government jet.
[00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:37.361]  They got hundreds of these government jets for Congress and people.
[00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:38.662]  They're all like royalty.
[00:52:41.229 --> 00:52:42.551]  I don't have a private Cessna!
[00:52:42.991 --> 00:52:45.674]  And I'm Alex Jones, pretty big, you know, media guy.
[00:52:46.895 --> 00:52:48.797]  Hell, I think a swimming pool's pretty fancy.
[00:52:49.318 --> 00:52:50.579]  I mean, who do these people have?
[00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:52.221]  Like, golden spoons in their mouths?
[00:52:52.562 --> 00:52:53.523]  Take it all away!
[00:52:53.783 --> 00:52:54.484]  I'm sick of it!
[00:52:58.598 --> 00:53:00.999]  I thought an F-150 was pretty damn fancy.
[00:53:01.199 --> 00:53:04.680]  Turns out this woman drives $190,000 Maybachs.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:05.240]  Yeah.
[00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:08.441]  She drives around in $190,000 cars.
[00:53:08.762 --> 00:53:09.862]  These people are criminals.
[00:53:10.222 --> 00:53:14.404]  She swindled to her husband tens of millions of dollars to his bank, a bailout money.
[00:53:14.684 --> 00:53:16.064]  She's a damn criminal!
[00:53:16.564 --> 00:53:18.245]  Excuse me, they put Maxine Waters on the screen.
[00:53:18.265 --> 00:53:20.406]  It made me start to have a little bit of a heart attack there.
[00:53:23.723 --> 00:53:24.503]  I don't like losing.
[00:53:24.523 --> 00:53:26.844]  I don't like seeing this country get run into the ground.
[00:53:27.064 --> 00:53:30.585]  We can beat these people if we just start making the right moves!
[00:53:32.665 --> 00:53:35.726]  Okay, I'm going to stop right now.
[00:53:36.506 --> 00:53:36.887]  Dave.
[00:53:38.187 --> 00:53:39.547]  I did take Turbo Force this morning.
[00:53:39.787 --> 00:53:42.008]  Okay.
[00:53:42.388 --> 00:53:43.708]  But it's also serious issues.
[00:53:44.389 --> 00:53:44.869]  Dave.
[00:53:44.929 --> 00:53:46.509]  See, I can't really take my own products.
[00:53:46.569 --> 00:53:47.449]  Dave in New York.
[00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:52.891]  Matthew, Sean, Julie, Diane, Gary, Mike, Tom, David, Keith.
[00:53:56.511 --> 00:54:04.475]  We're going to go to all of you starting with Dave in New York.
[00:54:04.515 --> 00:54:05.155]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:05.415]  Go ahead.
[00:54:05.435 --> 00:54:07.696]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:54:08.316 --> 00:54:09.677]  We're all lucky to have you.
[00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:14.991]  With your spiritual message, your message, you are the second coming of Thomas Jefferson.
[00:54:15.671 --> 00:54:23.153]  Just briefly, it seems like every time Trump needs to make a hard decision, we elected him to get rid of a corrupt establishment.
[00:54:23.233 --> 00:54:26.954]  And I feel like the stock market is the thing he's worried about most.
[00:54:26.994 --> 00:54:30.434]  He's worried about it going down, almost like they're holding it hostage.
[00:54:30.854 --> 00:54:34.095]  They have a recession all ready to go in 2020.
[00:54:35.095 --> 00:54:37.536]  If he were to make some tough decisions,
[00:54:38.257 --> 00:54:47.847]  It would be one step back, two step forward, and usher in the greatest era of prosperity in the world since the Renaissance.
[00:54:47.907 --> 00:54:48.548]  You know that.
[00:54:49.429 --> 00:54:50.130]  We all know that.
[00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.473]  And I'm glad that you're talking about it now.
[00:54:53.533 --> 00:54:54.074]  So thank you.
[00:54:54.554 --> 00:54:55.535]  No, sir, you're a smart guy.
[00:54:55.555 --> 00:54:57.197]  So tell me what you think he should do.
[00:54:57.217 --> 00:55:00.600]  Obviously, release all the secret documents of the illegal cabal against him.
[00:55:01.241 --> 00:55:04.464]  Because they keep saying they're going to back off and leave him alone, but then they never do.
[00:55:05.365 --> 00:55:06.186]  They're a bunch of snakes.
[00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:07.227]  They can't believe he's done this.
[00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:13.513]  He shouldn't be appointing this big swamp creature that George Herbert Walker Bush controlled, who's basically Robert Mueller's daddy.
[00:55:13.553 --> 00:55:15.155]  He should stop that nomination.
[00:55:15.716 --> 00:55:18.298]  He should declare an emergency, secure the border.
[00:55:18.578 --> 00:55:19.940]  I mean, it's all right there.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.963]  Of course he should pull the troops out, but every time they try to block him.
[00:55:24.116 --> 00:55:30.019]  Talk about the people who perjured, all the deep state that perjured themselves in front of the Pfizer court.
[00:55:30.919 --> 00:55:31.659]  Audit the Fed.
[00:55:31.679 --> 00:55:36.721]  Release classified information about, you name it, 9-11, even if it's JFK.
[00:55:37.622 --> 00:55:39.683]  Get the ball rolling further.
[00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:42.204]  Yeah, it's going to hurt the stock market in the short term.
[00:55:42.244 --> 00:55:48.847]  The stock market will come back, and he will do everything he set out to do, which is issue
[00:55:50.209 --> 00:55:53.470]  Start the greatest run of prosperity we've ever seen in America.
[00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:54.530]  Absolutely.
[00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:55.931]  And again, I'm not attacking Trump.
[00:55:55.971 --> 00:55:56.611]  His heart's good.
[00:55:56.651 --> 00:55:57.151]  He's strong.
[00:55:57.211 --> 00:55:58.051]  He's been through hell.
[00:55:58.071 --> 00:55:58.772]  So's his family.
[00:55:59.132 --> 00:56:00.132]  I'm going through the same stuff.
[00:56:00.172 --> 00:56:01.732]  So we're fellow travelers in that.
[00:56:02.273 --> 00:56:08.254]  But it's like we're in a football game and the quarterback is starting to act like he's not awake.
[00:56:08.695 --> 00:56:16.357]  And he's going to get his head taken off in these next few plays if he doesn't actually understand the deep state is arrogant,
[00:56:17.196 --> 00:56:18.217]  They're full of bravado.
[00:56:18.237 --> 00:56:20.698]  And the only thing they recognize is strength.
[00:56:21.259 --> 00:56:23.060]  And so they have to take action.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:28.643]  Trump and his supporters have to take action against the deep state or we're screwed.
[00:56:28.763 --> 00:56:34.106]  Even if in the short term he gets another 10% in the stock market.
[00:56:34.687 --> 00:56:35.828]  I work at a major bank.
[00:56:36.528 --> 00:56:40.230]  All the smartest minds on Wall Street are saying recession in 2020.
[00:56:40.611 --> 00:56:45.934]  So his best case scenario is they'll start a recession right around
[00:56:46.872 --> 00:56:48.373]  When he wants to be re-elected.
[00:56:49.374 --> 00:56:52.395]  And that'll help be his undoing.
[00:56:53.196 --> 00:56:54.857]  Not to mention his base might turn on him.
[00:56:55.237 --> 00:56:58.259]  So take the bitter pill.
[00:56:58.739 --> 00:56:59.760]  Take the step back.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.221]  Do the hard thing.
[00:57:01.261 --> 00:57:03.682]  Yeah, the market will go down in the short term, but it'll come back.
[00:57:03.822 --> 00:57:05.663]  And we'll all be proven right.
[00:57:05.703 --> 00:57:06.624]  And you'll be proven right.
[00:57:06.664 --> 00:57:07.524]  And you deserve that.
[00:57:07.544 --> 00:57:10.346]  And again, we appreciate all the work you're doing.
[00:57:10.366 --> 00:57:11.887]  Brother, I appreciate you.
[00:57:11.907 --> 00:57:12.547]  I appreciate you.
[00:57:12.587 --> 00:57:12.967]  God bless.
[00:57:14.813 --> 00:57:15.614]  Of course it's a bubble.
[00:57:16.215 --> 00:57:19.119]  But he was getting real industry back in the bubble, something the globals didn't want.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:25.908]  So he could have extended that out a while, released some innovations, some of the suppressed technologies, and we could have had a controlled crash.
[00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:29.253]  They raised all those interest rates to kill the economy.
[00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:33.057]  Trump called them out, so they started backing off and not killing as fast.
[00:57:33.698 --> 00:57:34.238]  Exactly.
[00:57:34.479 --> 00:57:35.800]  Use your executive power.
[00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:42.908]  Use your bully pulpit, Mr. President, or they're going to eat you alive like a bunch of satanic piranhas on PCP.
[00:57:43.528 --> 00:57:46.211]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number two.
[00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:48.373]  Your calls are only two minutes away.

[00:59:55.453 --> 01:00:01.355]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:08.435]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:08.955 --> 01:00:14.081]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:30.487 --> 01:00:32.929]  There's different estimates out there that the U.S.
[01:00:32.969 --> 01:00:36.272]  economy is losing a couple billion dollars a week conservatively.
[01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:40.816]  If you look at the stock market, if it goes down, it could be tens of billions a day.
[01:00:41.717 --> 01:00:45.800]  It could be trillions if it goes down a quarter.
[01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:49.163]  So the economy is being imploded by design.
[01:00:49.203 --> 01:00:51.065]  The Democrats all admit that that was their plan.
[01:00:52.196 --> 01:00:54.636]  They said, if we get back in, we're going to bring back all the regulations.
[01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:56.417]  That started killing confidence.
[01:00:57.197 --> 01:01:03.558]  All the interest rate hikes, all the Bill Maher quotes about, let's have a recession, let's have a collapse, that'll get Trump out.
[01:01:04.438 --> 01:01:06.859]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:01:06.899 --> 01:01:10.980]  You know, they wanted to get Obama in and not McCain in 2008.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.260]  So they plunged the economy right during the election.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.301]  This is not rocket science.
[01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:17.661]  And they admit they're doing it.
[01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:29.488]  The Founders had a system where if our borders are under attack, or under military attack, the homeland, the actual country, the President can circumvent Congress if they're not doing their job.
[01:01:31.169 --> 01:01:35.471]  And the President has hundreds of billions of dollars in his discretionary funding.
[01:01:37.372 --> 01:01:39.733]  He got them to increase the defense budget as a make-work.
[01:01:40.634 --> 01:01:43.255]  Fine with me as long as we're not in foreign countries killing innocent people.
[01:01:43.696 --> 01:01:44.616]  I like a strong deterrent.
[01:01:44.796 --> 01:01:45.997]  Peace through strength.
[01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:48.163]  He's got the power.
[01:01:48.283 --> 01:01:49.283]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:56.047]  It's not declaring an emergency over, you know, some rigged stock market deal that Henry Paulson did with Obama.
[01:01:57.027 --> 01:01:58.268]  This is happening now.
[01:01:58.868 --> 01:02:07.433]  Declare the national emergency like you should have months ago instead of letting the Democrats kill the economy by going, we're not going to do anything.
[01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:09.094]  We're just going to keep it shut down, period.
[01:02:09.354 --> 01:02:10.495]  Yeah, it makes them look bad.
[01:02:10.595 --> 01:02:11.375]  They don't care.
[01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:13.136]  Their constituents have 70 IQs.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.500]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:21.941]  I'm just going to go from top to bottom so we get to everybody here.
[01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:25.062]  Let's go to Danica.
[01:02:25.082 --> 01:02:26.743]  Let's go to Danica in Texas.
[01:02:26.783 --> 01:02:27.783]  Danica, thank you for holding.
[01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:29.784]  Hello?
[01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:30.424]  Hi.
[01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:33.085]  Hello, this is Danica.
[01:02:33.885 --> 01:02:35.066]  I'm sorry I got your name wrong.
[01:02:35.106 --> 01:02:36.386]  It just says Danica on the screen.
[01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:38.967]  It's not the first time, trust me.
[01:02:39.287 --> 01:02:40.968]  Well, it's a cool name.
[01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:41.748]  What does it mean?
[01:02:43.189 --> 01:02:46.110]  Well, it means Morning Star.
[01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:55.045]  Danish, I guess, but it comes from my dad, who's named Dana, and so it's kind of the closest thing that my parents could find to that.
[01:02:55.786 --> 01:02:56.566]  So it's Danica?
[01:02:58.248 --> 01:03:00.269]  Danica, with an I. Danica.
[01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.631]  Well, that's interesting.
[01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:05.294]  And of course, you know, the Morning Star in the Bible is very, very ambiguous.
[01:03:05.374 --> 01:03:09.898]  It's a riddle, I'm sure you know, because Lucifer's the Morning Star, but also Christ is the Morning Star.
[01:03:11.939 --> 01:03:13.901]  Yeah, oh yeah, I'm definitely aware of that.
[01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:14.982]  I actually studied
[01:03:15.678 --> 01:03:25.665]  Rhetoric in college, so I'm very in tune with the underlying meaning of words and especially how relevant that is.
[01:03:25.825 --> 01:03:29.507]  What do you make of that riddle in the Bible that Christ is the Morning Star, but also Lucifer is?
[01:03:29.527 --> 01:03:30.368]  What do you make of that riddle?
[01:03:32.129 --> 01:03:34.130]  I think it's great to confuse people.
[01:03:35.491 --> 01:03:38.933]  And you know, they say that there's that quote out there.
[01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:44.076]  I guess I won't quote it like exactly right, but something to the tune of
[01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:50.720]  The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing people that he didn't exist.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:57.761]  So kind of in that same realm of people just, um, and that's actually the topic of what I wanted to talk about today.
[01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:12.384]  I wanted to talk about, um, how important words are and making sure that things cannot be misconstrued nowadays with social media, especially in terms with the Covington Catholic students that
[01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:13.625]  Well, let's do this.
[01:04:13.705 --> 01:04:17.247]  Since I interrupted and butchered your name, we're going to go to break for 60 seconds.
[01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:23.351]  I'm going to come right back with the Covington Kids, because that's the next subject I want to get into, and the new insane developments.
[01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:24.131]  We knew it.
[01:04:24.191 --> 01:04:24.732]  We guessed it.
[01:04:24.892 --> 01:04:27.553]  He's a Democratic party, Soros operative confirmed.
[01:04:27.934 --> 01:04:37.400]  He went to other churches and would try to break into them, or go into services, and beating his drum, saying that Christianity attacked the natives and all this crap.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.082]  And, of course, he wasn't a Vietnam veteran.
[01:04:40.102 --> 01:04:40.863]  That was all a lie.
[01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:44.486]  And it's just, this guy doesn't just look like a demonic snake.
[01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:47.089]  He is a demonic snake.
[01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:51.634]  Absolute bottom-of-the-barrel, Democrat, filth, garbage.

[01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:08.312]  Another time.
[01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:10.634]  In the age of wonder.
[01:06:27.515 --> 01:06:42.007]  Danica in Texas wants to get into the situation with the Catholic school, Covington, young men and others, there were girls there as well.
[01:06:56.843 --> 01:06:57.543]  Being harassed.
[01:06:58.504 --> 01:07:00.264]  And we've all watched the raw footage now.
[01:07:00.664 --> 01:07:02.065]  Goes on for 20-30 minutes.
[01:07:02.725 --> 01:07:03.725]  Horrible expletives.
[01:07:03.805 --> 01:07:04.385]  Racism.
[01:07:04.405 --> 01:07:05.506]  We're going to harvest your organs.
[01:07:05.526 --> 01:07:06.406]  We're going to kill you.
[01:07:07.626 --> 01:07:08.767]  Your school shooters.
[01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.808]  The product of your parents being mothers and brothers.
[01:07:13.828 --> 01:07:16.489]  The same stuff I was told by similar groups up there a few months ago.
[01:07:17.369 --> 01:07:18.170]  Go back to Europe.
[01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:20.850]  And so you see groups of girls as well.
[01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:22.071]  They went around the back.
[01:07:22.611 --> 01:07:23.791]  The boys are all sitting there.
[01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:25.472]  And overcomes
[01:07:26.587 --> 01:07:32.570]  The Rambo commando, Green Beret, of course he wasn't, it's all a lie.
[01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.890]  Stolen valor.
[01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:35.711]  Here he comes.
[01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:44.475]  The Native American elder, the Democratic Party operative, comes slithering, slithering over to try to start a fight.
[01:07:45.656 --> 01:07:49.137]  And the media basically says, look at these horrible white supremacists.
[01:07:49.497 --> 01:07:50.798]  But now even the corporate media
[01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.086]  It had to back off all this.
[01:07:54.627 --> 01:07:59.891]  Doesn't tell you they were threatening to kill him or attack him or that they were taunting them or came over to them.
[01:08:00.532 --> 01:08:03.114]  They just say, well, the kids didn't surround him.
[01:08:03.274 --> 01:08:04.455]  It was a confrontation.
[01:08:04.835 --> 01:08:05.716]  It was a standoff.
[01:08:05.776 --> 01:08:10.360]  And were the kids right to be part of the standoff to an elder?
[01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:15.364]  A native elder and a commando veteran.
[01:08:16.585 --> 01:08:19.808]  Turns out he went AWOL a bunch and was a refrigerator repair person.
[01:08:20.268 --> 01:08:20.408]  So...
[01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:22.305]  There you go.
[01:08:22.325 --> 01:08:25.408]  The point is, everything about this guy is a lie.
[01:08:26.509 --> 01:08:30.853]  So Danica, from Texas, what is your point on this?
[01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:41.903]  So, I first want to say how I don't even know these boys, but I'm so proud of them for maintaining their composure and their dignity throughout this whole entire encounter.
[01:08:41.923 --> 01:08:46.648]  I have a younger brother, and I know that even though he's a
[01:08:47.674 --> 01:08:48.495]  Stand up guy.
[01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:57.362]  I know he might have not maintained his composure as well as these as these boys, and I think that they should really be the poster Children of.
[01:08:58.223 --> 01:09:04.529]  What American men should, you know, American boys should aspire to be like because they just.
[01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:08.432]  They stood with strength and they were not disrespectful.
[01:09:08.932 --> 01:09:11.415]  But of course, you're never going to hear the media say
[01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:21.986]  Um, you know, give, you know, should give hands to these boys for the way that they compose themselves.
[01:09:22.106 --> 01:09:25.128]  But, um, that's beside the point.
[01:09:25.148 --> 01:09:41.321]  I really want to talk about how, um, their silence just said so much because nowadays in the world that we live in with technology and social media and all of the stereotypes that are so exacerbated by social media, if they would have said
[01:09:42.165 --> 01:09:47.628]  Really even one thing, no matter what they said, I'm betting times a million that it would have been.
[01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:50.109]  Taken the wrong way and.
[01:09:50.129 --> 01:09:55.612]  You know, just blown up by the media, so.
[01:09:55.632 --> 01:10:03.456]  I think it's really great that they didn't say anything, but that just kind of brings me to.
[01:10:04.836 --> 01:10:07.738]  Talking about like the weight of words and
[01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:32.143]  How we have a responsibility, especially all the people listening to InfoWars, being so aware of words being twisted for an evil agenda, that we need to not play into that and continue to just cause controversy by fighting with each other against our words, but rise to another level, to a higher level, where we
[01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:39.579]  Absolutely.
[01:10:39.599 --> 01:10:51.849]  Instead of engaging them in a fight, just pull back like we are non-biased, which we're not biased, just at the facts, and just discuss what we're seeing and the mechanics of what we're actually being told.
[01:10:52.389 --> 01:10:52.809]  Great points.
[01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:53.670]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.711]  Thanks for calling in.
[01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:57.571]  Think about all the lies here, though.
[01:10:58.131 --> 01:10:59.572]  The media had to crop the video.
[01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:06.113]  They then lied and didn't show the audio, didn't play the audio, and told everybody that they were chanting, build that wall.
[01:11:07.314 --> 01:11:11.054]  They lied so that they'd surrounded the people screaming racist things at them.
[01:11:11.074 --> 01:11:17.396]  And then they said that they were making fun of them when actually they were clapping and smiling and jumping up and down.
[01:11:19.415 --> 01:11:24.018]  Even while they were being told, get out of here white people, we're going to kill you and take your organs.
[01:11:24.799 --> 01:11:31.443]  And these kids are so cool, I mean, this must be an awesome school, that they're taking this nicely.
[01:11:31.463 --> 01:11:33.544]  Let me tell you something.
[01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:45.492]  When I was 14, 15, 16, just the average person in Dallas, I don't care if you're an adult or who you were, we were all polite and nice, but if somebody got in our face and started beating drums in our face or telling us they were going to kick our ass, you'd have a problem.
[01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:52.338]  I'm extremely proud of these young men because they're better young men than I was.
[01:11:52.818 --> 01:12:00.860]  I was nice to old ladies and, you know, would help open doors for women and stuff, but I had a bad side, which some would say was a good side.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:13.923]  I mean, let's just say if there was a teleportation device and this was 35 years ago, and I was 15 or 14, and people are screaming, we're going to kill you and stuff, it wouldn't have been pretty.
[01:12:16.641 --> 01:12:16.881]  Yes.
[01:12:17.422 --> 01:12:20.224]  In fact, they were there provocateuring.
[01:12:20.264 --> 01:12:22.947]  They were looking for the fight.
[01:12:23.928 --> 01:12:25.209]  But I've grown up a lot now.
[01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:27.491]  I let them grab my genitals and lick my face.
[01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:29.573]  We're showing video of that if you're a TV viewer.
[01:12:29.893 --> 01:12:31.715]  And the man said, I want to have sex with children.
[01:12:31.735 --> 01:12:34.998]  He actually said, why don't you like having sex with children?
[01:12:35.038 --> 01:12:35.579]  I like it!
[01:12:36.259 --> 01:12:36.720]  I like them!
[01:12:38.732 --> 01:12:40.954]  And it's just like he's licking my face.
[01:12:40.974 --> 01:12:44.778]  And of course the police didn't charge him because he is a god.
[01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.060]  He wants to walk up and grab my genitals.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.842]  He wants to slap me in the face.
[01:12:49.683 --> 01:12:50.984]  He wants to lick my nose.
[01:12:51.484 --> 01:12:52.866]  He is a god!
[01:12:54.007 --> 01:12:54.427]  Period!
[01:12:55.969 --> 01:13:03.216]  See, I'm trying to get angry today, but every time you show me this stuff... And I was just gonna let him keep doing it because I wasn't gonna give him what he wanted.
[01:13:04.687 --> 01:13:09.251]  And it was an event called, The Fake News of Donald Trump and Alex Jones, and how to stop it.
[01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:15.397]  And they were there celebrating taking me off the air, and how they had to get everybody else off the air, which they've done since then.
[01:13:15.417 --> 01:13:16.979]  They just have to sell it.
[01:13:17.079 --> 01:13:17.840]  Oh, but guess what?
[01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:26.068]  All three of the people on stage, three of the four, lost their jobs the next month.
[01:13:28.285 --> 01:13:28.645]  That's right.
[01:13:29.466 --> 01:13:31.327]  All of them got their jobs cut back or lost.
[01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:34.810]  The statesman guy had worked for that company for 30 years.
[01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:36.371]  He lost his job.
[01:13:36.731 --> 01:13:39.013]  The anti-free speech lady, she got her grant funding cut.
[01:13:39.053 --> 01:13:39.674]  I saw it in the news.
[01:13:40.094 --> 01:13:42.796]  And the BuzzFeed guy drifted off and word is he got his pay cut.
[01:13:43.056 --> 01:13:44.858]  Because the mission's accomplished now, right?
[01:13:46.219 --> 01:13:51.763]  Be gatekeepers, lie about people, get them shut off the air, have a celebratory party, and then lose your job.
[01:13:53.024 --> 01:13:54.245]  What a bunch of dumbasses.
[01:13:56.334 --> 01:13:57.695]  Oh, and they had really good discipline.
[01:13:57.775 --> 01:13:59.316]  There was no reportage of what I did.
[01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:02.818]  And then they had the YouTube that had like 200,000 views in one day.
[01:14:03.298 --> 01:14:05.780]  Somebody's channel picked it up off Infowars.com.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:06.660]  They took it down.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.601]  They deep-sixed it.
[01:14:07.761 --> 01:14:08.421]  They got rid of it.
[01:14:10.202 --> 01:14:11.863]  Because that's how these people operate.
[01:14:12.223 --> 01:14:12.824]  That's what they do.
[01:14:12.844 --> 01:14:14.665]  I didn't mean to get hot.
[01:14:16.206 --> 01:14:19.868]  There, we've got all these great callers I'm going to get to in rapid pace when we come back.
[01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.950]  But I was just thinking about what happened with the school.
[01:14:24.565 --> 01:14:26.666]  Give me a document cam shot so I can show TV viewers this.
[01:14:26.706 --> 01:14:27.987]  I'll read them off for radio listeners.
[01:14:30.028 --> 01:14:31.829]  It's been, and this is an article from days ago.
[01:14:31.849 --> 01:14:33.210]  I asked them to print all the articles about this.
[01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:39.294]  Kathy Griffin, four days later, still hadn't taken down her tweet saying go to their houses and get them, as of this morning.
[01:14:41.135 --> 01:14:46.278]  All these well-known musicians and Democrats that said go to their schools, shoot them, kill them, murder them, burn the school down.
[01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.859]  Their sights are up.
[01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:50.280]  They've not gotten in trouble.
[01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:59.472]  Media shamelessly framed the kids with scorn and abuse, and now they won't even tell you that they were being threatened with death.
[01:15:00.793 --> 01:15:05.134]  Twitter laws verified, accounts to call for violence against conservative high school students.
[01:15:06.475 --> 01:15:13.057]  SNL writer offers oral sex for anyone who punches anyone wearing a mega hat, and especially children.
[01:15:13.937 --> 01:15:19.799]  So they organize, notice what they say I did at Sandy Hook with no proof, and then say take me off air.
[01:15:21.578 --> 01:15:25.845]  They're currently contacting radio stations, Democrat Funding Group, saying, he's on the air today!
[01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:27.708]  Saying nobody died at Sandy Hook!
[01:15:27.928 --> 01:15:28.329]  Help us!
[01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:29.371]  He's after us!
[01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:30.833]  It was in the Washington Post last week.
[01:15:31.755 --> 01:15:34.359]  Roku, we took him off because he was saying, go after kids.
[01:15:35.211 --> 01:15:35.671]  On Roku.
[01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:36.592]  No, I wasn't.
[01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.053]  It's like yelling fire in a theater or a false police report.
[01:15:39.453 --> 01:15:40.293]  And there will be lawsuits.
[01:15:40.313 --> 01:15:41.053]  I'm letting folks know.
[01:15:41.073 --> 01:15:42.674]  I'm meeting with lawyers this morning.
[01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:45.195]  Very serious ones.
[01:15:45.215 --> 01:15:52.118]  So again, they lie about me, what I've said to Sandy Hook, build a straw man, then repeat it like Howard Stern's doing, and then say I'm hurting kids.
[01:15:53.278 --> 01:15:53.778]  You understand?
[01:15:53.978 --> 01:16:00.701]  And then call for me to be taken off the air for what they're saying and they're doing while they're doing the exact same thing currently to real kids, saying kill them.
[01:16:13.405 --> 01:16:25.096]  I recently saw a Gillette ad owned by Procter & Gamble that spent a minute and a half showing men as the enemy.
[01:16:25.717 --> 01:16:28.379]  That if a man tries to talk to a beautiful woman, he's a bad guy.
[01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:33.104]  Or if two kids get in a fight, somehow just men fighting, period, is evil.
[01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:48.183]  When you look at the Romans conquering civilizations where they would kill all the men, or you look at black slaves with the women being kept as the house servants to suppress the men, you know that any authoritarian society seeking to dominate wants to suppress the men.
[01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:52.565]  Then you read the white papers, the Global says exactly what they're doing.
[01:16:54.326 --> 01:16:57.107]  So men have now learned that this has happened.
[01:16:57.688 --> 01:17:04.291]  And their chemicals added to the water, added to the food, try to suppress their normal drive, their normal ethos, who they are.
[01:17:05.646 --> 01:17:11.531]  And that's why, online, herbs and supplements known to boost libido, stamina, and energy are such best sellers.
[01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:13.673]  That's why I'm getting into that market.
[01:17:14.914 --> 01:17:23.461]  Six, seven years ago, as a producer, I went out and found the most powerful formulas out there to not just give men, but also women, a boost.
[01:17:24.022 --> 01:17:26.344]  Super male, super female vitality.
[01:17:26.744 --> 01:17:31.909]  No one else produces a herbal formula that's cold-pressed and then aged.
[01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.732]  Like this group does in Utah.
[01:17:36.713 --> 01:17:41.838]  And they've had so much trouble getting the wild sourced herbs that I'm having to discontinue it.
[01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:45.621]  Now they've said maybe in a year, maybe in two, they can bring it back.
[01:17:45.681 --> 01:17:49.984]  But right now, this is the last run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:17:50.024 --> 01:17:50.505]  It's 50% off.
[01:17:50.585 --> 01:17:56.210]  Even though it's selling out, I want you to experience what God gave us through nature.
[01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.552]  But regardless, if you're depressed, go out and go for a hike.
[01:18:00.427 --> 01:18:03.928]  If you feel like you're a loser, you know, go out and help people at a soup kitchen.
[01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:07.949]  Because all the studies show, giving is better than receiving.
[01:18:08.789 --> 01:18:11.049]  You've given to us in incredible ways at InfoWars.
[01:18:11.069 --> 01:18:16.550]  You've supported us, you've been demonized for us, you've bought our products, and you've been fulfilled by it.
[01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:17.471]  You've seen great results.
[01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:18.691]  And I thank you for that.
[01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:23.692]  But when I bring out a product, I want to make sure it's the very best I can for you at the very best price.
[01:18:23.952 --> 01:18:28.353]  Because I appreciate what you're doing, and I believe in the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[01:18:29.389 --> 01:18:30.009]  So I salute you.
[01:18:30.029 --> 01:18:30.530]  I thank you.

[01:18:39.494 --> 01:18:40.054]  You know, it's funny.
[01:18:40.074 --> 01:18:41.575]  The price went up and up and up for it.
[01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:46.117]  And it is a great formula and a bestseller with 4,000 plus five star reviews.
[01:18:47.837 --> 01:19:02.560]  The last year I couldn't get resupplied and I said I'm not gonna buy it the last six months and now we're in discussions maybe the herbs can be gotten and it is hard but the point is is that I'm giving you such a low price that what I'm selling it to you for becomes cost prohibitive to bring you something like this.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.162]  We brought out powdered versions that are even stronger but are powdered and organic but not cold-pressed.
[01:19:08.542 --> 01:19:09.722]  People like them but not as much.
[01:19:10.262 --> 01:19:13.163]  Because there's something about super male and super female vitality.

[01:19:51.564 --> 01:19:51.984]  Thank you all.
[01:20:06.389 --> 01:20:10.852]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.199 --> 01:20:32.087]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide
[01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:39.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:45.011]  So riddle me this, Batman.
[01:20:46.931 --> 01:20:54.753]  The Democratic Party funded lawyers for the Sandy Hook families for years saying Alex Jones is sending people to our houses.
[01:20:54.813 --> 01:20:55.173]  Stop!
[01:20:56.113 --> 01:20:59.273]  So that's when I really started saying, hey, nobody go to anybody's houses.
[01:20:59.293 --> 01:21:00.094]  I never said do that.
[01:21:00.494 --> 01:21:01.654]  This is like three, four years ago.
[01:21:03.103 --> 01:21:08.265]  And then they just kept saying in the news for years that I'm saying nobody died at Sandy Hook, and then editing tapes out of context.
[01:21:08.905 --> 01:21:11.066]  So I've said thousands of times, stop saying it.
[01:21:12.487 --> 01:21:20.310]  And then now they go on the news, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, ABC News, and say, he's currently sending people here to our houses, help us, he's doxing us!
[01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:21.911]  He's saying he's gonna get us!
[01:21:24.131 --> 01:21:25.212]  I gotta take legal action.
[01:21:26.973 --> 01:21:32.675]  I mean, if you say you're suing me because I did that, and then you're doing it when I've been telling you I haven't been saying that,
[01:21:34.144 --> 01:21:37.745]  If that's this clear and present danger, then you're the one doing it in my name.
[01:21:38.105 --> 01:21:44.727]  Stealing my identity and how famous I am, that it brings attention on these lawyers and others when they do it.
[01:21:45.888 --> 01:21:48.969]  So, I mean, I'm meeting with top lawyers today, after the show.
[01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:49.909]  I met with them this morning.
[01:21:49.969 --> 01:21:51.710]  I have to take action against you.
[01:21:52.330 --> 01:22:01.153]  Because I can't have my identity stolen, and have you just run around and say things I never said, and then say things you said I said in the present tense.
[01:22:03.047 --> 01:22:06.970]  I mean, it's like calling the police department and saying, this guy's on radio saying, send people to my house.
[01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:08.651]  The police would go to that radio station.
[01:22:08.811 --> 01:22:15.076]  Because you're not just a radio station free speech now, you're saying, hey, you know, go to this place and harass these people.
[01:22:16.477 --> 01:22:17.298]  In the present tense.
[01:22:19.179 --> 01:22:20.520]  You're calling for a mob to do things.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:21.461]  I'm not doing that.
[01:22:24.123 --> 01:22:24.823]  So they twist it.
[01:22:25.404 --> 01:22:28.246]  And so that's what Ann Coulter said yesterday in a tweet that I never got to.
[01:22:29.505 --> 01:22:35.067]  Journalists, August 2018, Alex Jones caused the families of Sandy Hook victims to be harassed.
[01:22:35.107 --> 01:22:37.428]  He must be banned from all social media.
[01:22:39.228 --> 01:22:42.690]  Journalists of 2019, please kill these children and their families.
[01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:46.251]  And that's Kathy Lee Griffin.
[01:22:46.311 --> 01:22:47.391]  That's hundreds of them.
[01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:49.532]  Prominent people still have it up.
[01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:50.492]  Kill them.
[01:22:50.793 --> 01:22:51.293]  Shoot them.
[01:22:51.573 --> 01:22:52.353]  Burn them down.
[01:22:52.673 --> 01:22:53.553]  Kill their families.
[01:22:53.994 --> 01:22:54.454]  Get them.
[01:22:55.114 --> 01:22:57.455]  And she still hasn't taken it down!
[01:23:00.074 --> 01:23:13.080]  I can show you, I can show you, ladies and gentlemen, where this is actually going on and happening.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.782]  And I'm not mad at the crew because they have fun in there, but I don't want this pinned on me.
[01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:23.218]  I don't make fun of physically disabled people and then compare it to Kathie Lee Griffin.
[01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.299]  She looks like a vampire demon.
[01:23:25.819 --> 01:23:30.261]  The poor sad person with bone defects in the famous movie, I forget who he is.
[01:23:30.281 --> 01:23:33.502]  They were putting up stuff on TV, radio listener, making a joke out of that.
[01:23:33.602 --> 01:23:34.103]  I don't know.
[01:23:34.583 --> 01:23:36.023]  Let's not, let's not do that.
[01:23:37.624 --> 01:23:42.386]  No, no, she's a bad person because she said, go to kids' houses and attack their families and all this.
[01:23:42.426 --> 01:23:43.466]  And now people are saying, kill them.
[01:23:43.827 --> 01:23:44.767]  And the school had to close.
[01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:46.828]  So here's the breaking news and I'll go to your phone calls.
[01:23:48.968 --> 01:23:50.650]  We got the video clip coming up next segment.
[01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:58.801]  Lawyers for Covington Catholic High School family threatens lawsuits against media unless they retract false stories.
[01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:01.750]  They're being given 48 hours.
[01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:05.571]  That doesn't mean kind of, oh, later go, oh, maybe we're wrong.
[01:24:05.851 --> 01:24:07.151]  They both confronted each other.
[01:24:07.171 --> 01:24:07.931]  There was a fight.
[01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:09.192]  No, we lied.
[01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:10.092]  We edited the tape.
[01:24:10.792 --> 01:24:11.632]  They marched over.
[01:24:12.032 --> 01:24:12.932]  They got in their face.
[01:24:12.972 --> 01:24:13.892]  They threatened to kill him.
[01:24:14.492 --> 01:24:16.153]  This guy wasn't a Vietnam vet.
[01:24:16.193 --> 01:24:17.893]  This guy's a Democratic Party operative.
[01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:21.794]  You're not a white supremacist if you're wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
[01:24:21.814 --> 01:24:23.034]  You've defamed these people.
[01:24:23.294 --> 01:24:24.394]  You've endangered them.
[01:24:25.234 --> 01:24:28.015]  So now you have to 100% say it's all wrong.
[01:24:28.455 --> 01:24:29.535]  And it's legally binding.
[01:24:30.882 --> 01:24:32.804]  The lawyer was just on Fox News during the break.
[01:24:33.664 --> 01:24:34.064]  I saw it.
[01:24:34.365 --> 01:24:36.927]  And I've got the article right here saying, listen, we're Christians.
[01:24:37.827 --> 01:24:38.848]  We're going to give you grace.
[01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:40.469]  Catholic Christians.
[01:24:42.031 --> 01:24:45.734]  48 hours to reverse it all or we're going to have to sue you because we're in danger.
[01:24:46.334 --> 01:24:58.063]  Well, so am I. I can't have the Democratic Party running around saying, I'm doxing people and I'm harassing people and I'm going to their house and I'm doing all this when there's no proof.
[01:24:58.423 --> 01:24:58.944]  Didn't do it.
[01:25:01.567 --> 01:25:02.448]  Didn't do it.
[01:25:04.449 --> 01:25:13.515]  And so, that's the reality, is the Democrats are doing everything they say we do, but they're actually doing it out in the open.
[01:25:16.477 --> 01:25:17.017]  It's amazing.
[01:25:18.298 --> 01:25:20.679]  And even Fox News calls it an encounter with a Native American.
[01:25:20.739 --> 01:25:20.919]  No.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:27.884]  The Native American is a horrible activist that that day invaded churches, tried to get people to physically attack him.
[01:25:27.924 --> 01:25:28.664]  It's his specialty.
[01:25:29.665 --> 01:25:30.706]  He goes to colleges.
[01:25:32.063 --> 01:25:43.688]  On Halloween, trying to find a Native American themed party, because I can tell you, they do Greek, they do Barbarians, they do Native Americans, they do kind of Western style.
[01:25:43.708 --> 01:25:48.110]  There was a Blade Runner party.
[01:25:49.892 --> 01:25:53.594]  That one of my friends was telling me about his son in college and that was fun.
[01:25:54.035 --> 01:25:55.416]  So you have themed parties.
[01:25:56.136 --> 01:26:00.259]  Well this jerk, that's why some colleges have banned Native American themed parties.
[01:26:00.359 --> 01:26:00.659]  Why?
[01:26:00.679 --> 01:26:00.739]  Why?
[01:26:01.419 --> 01:26:01.700]  Why?
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:01.780]  Why?
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:09.345]  You should be able to have a party, a scream or a Charlie Manson themed party.
[01:26:09.585 --> 01:26:11.486]  Whatever party you want to have, you should be able to have it.
[01:26:13.227 --> 01:26:16.929]  But if you don't want to be a ghoul or you don't want to be, then you do a cultural thing.
[01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:19.131]  I talked about Austin Yoga Place I read about.
[01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:23.252]  For Halloween, they were gonna have a party with an Eastern-style dress.
[01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:24.193]  It's yoga!
[01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:25.293]  You're honoring the East.
[01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:27.034]  You're following its system.
[01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.076]  A lot of the people there were Indians.
[01:26:29.776 --> 01:26:33.259]  But it was liberal white women who said, this is racist.
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.722]  And so, they stopped having any parties and they sold the yoga studio that was very successful.
[01:26:39.283 --> 01:26:40.784]  I said I'd go to your calls, and I'm digressing.
[01:26:41.444 --> 01:26:43.446]  It's just, yeah, they have nerd-themed parties.
[01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.768]  They have office space-style parties.
[01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:50.251]  They have Pokemon parties.
[01:26:51.071 --> 01:26:55.913]  It's all good fun, and it's the left saying, no, we control language.
[01:26:56.934 --> 01:26:58.194]  We control what you can do.
[01:26:58.274 --> 01:26:59.475]  We control what you can say.
[01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:03.556]  So I didn't do this to the Sandy Hook families, and they're suing me.
[01:27:03.916 --> 01:27:08.058]  These people did it, and won't say they're sorry, and it's dangerous.
[01:27:09.218 --> 01:27:10.319]  It's criminal harassment.
[01:27:10.739 --> 01:27:12.780]  This isn't even, this is conscious.
[01:27:15.694 --> 01:27:16.594]  All right, let's go to your call, sir.
[01:27:16.634 --> 01:27:18.735]  I apologize for making people hold, but I'm doing pretty good here.
[01:27:18.795 --> 01:27:21.535]  Matthew in Nevada, what's your take on this whole situation?
[01:27:22.636 --> 01:27:23.516]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:24.056]  My pleasure.
[01:27:25.956 --> 01:27:26.576]  What's on your mind?
[01:27:27.537 --> 01:27:32.878]  You know, I just wanted to chime in on the school, those Catholic boys.
[01:27:33.758 --> 01:27:38.019]  And I do agree with your last caller, how she talked about how they had their control and all that.
[01:27:38.039 --> 01:27:43.020]  But, you know, you got young boys standing there with men in clubs saying they're going to kill you.
[01:27:43.618 --> 01:27:49.465]  Let me tell you what, here in Reno, I'd have taken that pom-pom and Navajo Joe and stuffed it in his eye.
[01:27:49.826 --> 01:27:54.451]  Because I'll tell you what, Alex, this stripping of our masculinity, I've had it.
[01:27:54.992 --> 01:27:55.573]  I've had it.
[01:27:56.514 --> 01:28:00.539]  And, you know, sit there and watch these guys get verbalized by men.
[01:28:02.054 --> 01:28:05.798]  I wish there was a man there that would have stood up and showed them what we do.
[01:28:06.259 --> 01:28:12.906]  By the way, the school for the first two days criticized the students and jumped on them, and the teachers overall just kind of went and hid.
[01:28:12.966 --> 01:28:13.987]  There were adults there.
[01:28:14.327 --> 01:28:16.309]  They just walked away.
[01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:22.496]  So, absolutely, why didn't the teachers go over and say, hey buddy, get out of our space right now?
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:24.481]  It's insanity.
[01:28:25.301 --> 01:28:28.944]  It's all part of neutering men, and I'm telling you, I've had it.
[01:28:29.024 --> 01:28:31.826]  You know, we've been overrun here by California.
[01:28:32.246 --> 01:28:42.034]  We used to be a really good red state, and Northern Cal has taken Reno and Southern Cal has taken Vegas, but the majority of us, I mean, we're like Texas.
[01:28:43.257 --> 01:28:44.899]  We had a big wide open.
[01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:45.819]  We carry our guns.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.683]  We're not wimpy people over here, but we're in trouble.
[01:28:49.883 --> 01:28:54.887]  And then they show up and act like you shouldn't have a four-wheel drive or a rifle in it.
[01:28:54.947 --> 01:28:55.508]  Stay there.
[01:28:55.528 --> 01:28:57.710]  I want you to finish up.
[01:28:57.730 --> 01:28:59.551]  We've got a guest popping in.
[01:28:59.571 --> 01:28:59.992]  We've spent
[01:29:11.653 --> 01:29:13.246]  Two years.
[01:29:14.915 --> 01:29:24.481]  And had to pay top formulators and scientists from the top labs in the country to make what they believed was the best energy drink replacement.
[01:29:24.521 --> 01:29:26.283]  Because energy drinks are bad, on average.
[01:29:26.363 --> 01:29:34.468]  So we had the top formulator and the top natural health guru that advises the Olympic Committee, the NFL, you name it.
[01:29:34.528 --> 01:29:35.749]  That'd pay him a lot of money, too.
[01:29:35.769 --> 01:29:37.450]  And we had other groups go double-check it.
[01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:44.855]  Because I said, if the average energy drink has 30 cents of product that's actually energy and a bunch of sugar and crap and no minerals or vitamins,
[01:29:44.995 --> 01:29:50.719]  I said, what would happen if we sold something for $50 and it had $20 of product in it?
[01:29:50.739 --> 01:29:53.360]  And they said, that's not even done.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:54.201]  That's impossible.
[01:29:55.376 --> 01:29:56.897]  It's just not, it's not done.
[01:29:57.197 --> 01:29:59.038]  So you have to understand how my brain works.
[01:29:59.078 --> 01:30:01.560]  How, how, how, how I operate.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:09.364]  I said, I want the strongest, most powerful, cleanest, healthiest system with all of the key upload enzymes in it.
[01:30:09.464 --> 01:30:23.072]  Because the body, it doesn't matter how much energy drink you drink after a while, it depletes vitamins and minerals and cofactors and key chemicals that are needed to actually get it through the blood, through the blood-brain barrier, and to the cells in a healthy way without the crash.
[01:30:23.692 --> 01:30:26.595]  So imagine if there was an energy drink without the crash.
[01:30:26.996 --> 01:30:31.221]  Imagine if there was an energy drink without the toxicity and the sugar and all the garbage.
[01:30:31.641 --> 01:30:38.589]  Imagine if there was an energy drink that actually had everything that was really a vitamin and mineral fusion with everything else.
[01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:39.911]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:40.011 --> 01:30:42.674]  And I'll tell you right now that it is next level.
[01:30:42.874 --> 01:30:43.455]  TurboForce.
[01:30:43.735 --> 01:31:00.545]  Energy, metabolism, alertness, and if you look at the back of the box, it goes into everything it's got, ladies and gentlemen, and it's got the herbal energy blend that are all these different types of naturally occurring systems within chemicals that are naturally occurring in the plants to help upload it naturally, and it's all there.
[01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:06.509]  This is someone going to a bunch of top researchers, we went to four different groups, and saying, give us your plan of the
[01:31:06.889 --> 01:31:10.913]  Next level muscle car in natural, healthy energy.
[01:31:11.033 --> 01:31:15.358]  And again, BrainForce Plus is mainly in nootropic with a little bit of clean energy.
[01:31:15.418 --> 01:31:16.039]  People love it.
[01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:20.583]  This is ultimate pre-workout, but ultimate start your day or take in the middle of the day.
[01:31:20.783 --> 01:31:26.729]  I, quite frankly, BrainForce works so good on me, I can barely take it, but I need to stay up all night because it goes to and pop one at 10 o'clock at night.
[01:31:26.769 --> 01:31:27.450]  I'm good at midnight.
[01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:28.091]  I'm up all night.
[01:31:28.311 --> 01:31:30.013]  I go to sleep and don't crash from it the next day.
[01:31:30.113 --> 01:31:40.322]  So this complements Brainforce Plus, but this is a packet form, and quite frankly, I said make it one of the strongest out there on the market, but make it clean and make it good.
[01:31:41.484 --> 01:31:52.414]  Most people, I would suggest, you take a quarter packet the first time you take it, because when we got prototypes of this a few months ago in, everyone was bouncing off the walls, and we can't even believe this is legal.
[01:31:52.594 --> 01:31:54.476]  Bouncing off the walls.
[01:31:54.756 --> 01:31:59.339]  Because it has a spectrum of every natural form of caffeine there is.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.764]  But stuff that has a 4-hour burn rate, a 3-hour burn rate, a 2-hour burn rate, a 1-hour burn rate.
[01:32:04.884 --> 01:32:10.128]  It's got all of these different enzymes that upload it so you get a way bigger response.
[01:32:10.328 --> 01:32:11.089]  I think this is good.
[01:32:11.589 --> 01:32:12.270]  And I'm proud of it.
[01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:14.612]  And you'll use it responsibly.
[01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:19.176]  But I said, give us the most powerful, clean, healthy thing, but in this genre.
[01:32:19.296 --> 01:32:21.298]  And I cannot believe we even produced this.
[01:32:21.398 --> 01:32:23.200]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.702]  Turbo force, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:24.822 --> 01:32:26.824]  I mean, I think you should put a half in your water first.
[01:32:27.004 --> 01:32:29.506]  Why don't you get up in the morning and try this instead of your coffee?
[01:32:29.666 --> 01:32:33.390]  It's hard to even get into why this is so good because there's so many ingredients.
[01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:35.652]  I mean, there's just a ton of ingredients in this, baby.
[01:32:35.792 --> 01:32:36.613]  A ton of ingredients.
[01:32:36.633 --> 01:32:39.516]  This took two years to develop, and it's to the moon without a rocket.
[01:32:39.576 --> 01:32:43.199]  So, get your first run of TurboForce 33% off at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:43.239 --> 01:32:44.921]  TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:45.702]  No reviews yet.
[01:32:45.722 --> 01:32:45.702]  $39.95.
[01:32:45.762 --> 01:32:46.823]  Blows away everything on the planet.
[01:32:46.843 --> 01:32:47.784]  This is the ultimate.
[01:33:06.354 --> 01:33:08.959]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:32.152]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:33:32.653 --> 01:33:43.166]  Robert Barnes is a lawyer for some of the families of the Covington High School from Kentucky who've been doxed, death-threatened, called Nazis, publicly destroyed.
[01:33:43.727 --> 01:33:46.150]  The corporate media edited the tape, knew what they were doing.
[01:33:47.159 --> 01:33:49.360]  But they didn't think the internet would show what really happened.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.963]  How the group of miscreant racists would then invade, get in their face screaming, we're gonna kill you, whiteys, take your organs.
[01:33:56.343 --> 01:33:58.464]  Screaming at the minority kids with them, particularly.
[01:33:59.305 --> 01:34:01.646]  Calling them fags, calling them all sorts of other names.
[01:34:02.166 --> 01:34:06.808]  Saying that they were the product of incest, that their mother and father were brother and sister.
[01:34:06.828 --> 01:34:08.769]  It's the standard stuff that white people get.
[01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:09.590]  It's very, very sad.
[01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.130]  Most minorities aren't like this.
[01:34:11.191 --> 01:34:13.372]  But the Democrats are trying to invoke this.
[01:34:14.612 --> 01:34:20.257]  Uh, stolen glory, fake veteran of Vietnam, so-called Native American elder.
[01:34:20.917 --> 01:34:25.000]  Turns out this guy, that day, went in a Catholic church, beating his drum, trying to get a fight going.
[01:34:25.481 --> 01:34:27.002]  Turns out that's his specialty.
[01:34:27.982 --> 01:34:28.683]  That's what he does.
[01:34:28.723 --> 01:34:29.904]  He's a provocateur.
[01:34:30.544 --> 01:34:32.506]  So let's play a clip from the lawyer.
[01:34:32.866 --> 01:34:37.690]  Lawyers for Covington Catholic High School families threatens lawsuit against media unless they retract false stories.
[01:34:39.548 --> 01:34:50.352]  They're willing to extend you a 48-hour time period, a period of grace, consistent with their Christian faith, for you to, through confession, get redemption and retract and correct and apologize.
[01:34:50.672 --> 01:34:53.793]  If you do not, then next week you may be a defendant in a lawsuit.
[01:34:55.461 --> 01:35:00.426]  All right, now let's go back to a caller who was making a point that I'm gonna go to a guest who's just gonna pop in for part of this segment in the next.
[01:35:00.786 --> 01:35:06.011]  I promise we'll go right back to Julie, Diane, Mike, Robert, David, Jacob, and others.
[01:35:06.031 --> 01:35:08.493]  We'll get to all of you because this is very important.
[01:35:08.533 --> 01:35:15.380]  But we had Matthew in Nevada making the point that people are saying we're gonna kill you, go back to Europe, we're gonna harvest your organs.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:18.363]  The provocateur wasn't doing it, he was just beating the drum in their face.
[01:35:18.843 --> 01:35:22.026]  And then had the people with him that he led over like the Pied Piper.
[01:35:22.486 --> 01:35:23.907]  That's what these provocateurs do.
[01:35:23.947 --> 01:35:25.209]  That's what's in the Antifa documents.
[01:35:25.689 --> 01:35:28.051]  It's how you go to inner city areas, they target blacks.
[01:35:28.371 --> 01:35:30.913]  It actually says it in the documents.
[01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:31.774]  2018, we got them.
[01:35:32.295 --> 01:35:35.137]  And it was how they're trying to cause martial law and race riots.
[01:35:35.778 --> 01:35:37.459]  And it talked about how they're Antifa people.
[01:35:37.979 --> 01:35:39.281]  They start the violence.
[01:35:39.301 --> 01:35:40.241]  They start the call.
[01:35:40.281 --> 01:35:41.442]  They even have drums sometimes.
[01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:44.185]  And then they try to trigger the population to get even more violent.
[01:35:45.066 --> 01:35:52.068]  They have agreed areas they can target with the police, certain trash cans, certain businesses that are in on it at a corporate level, like Starbucks.
[01:35:52.088 --> 01:35:53.368]  I always wonder why they always attack Starbucks.
[01:35:53.789 --> 01:35:55.069]  Starbucks doesn't press charges.
[01:35:55.389 --> 01:35:56.189]  It's all authorized.
[01:35:56.609 --> 01:35:57.430]  That's in the documents.
[01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:02.331]  So it's all social engineering, a larger mob psychology plan.
[01:36:02.371 --> 01:36:04.032]  So I get what you're saying, Matthew.
[01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:04.812]  It sounds good.
[01:36:05.692 --> 01:36:32.170]  To have one of the adults there come up, people are making death threats and punch them, and the police should have done something, but wise as a serpent, peaceful as a dove, there's a time to fight, a time to not fight, a time to turn the cheek, a time to not turn the cheek, but, and I get what you're saying, and I said the same thing, but doesn't it blow up in their face better that they didn't respond with the death threats, because now that's the last thing the corporate media is still covering up, is the death threats, and that's going to come out now.
[01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:32.490]  Go ahead.
[01:36:33.442 --> 01:36:34.002]  So you're right.
[01:36:34.443 --> 01:36:39.065]  I agree with you on that, Alex, that the right thing was to stand down like they did.
[01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.686]  But like I said, these were boys.
[01:36:40.907 --> 01:36:41.507]  They weren't men.
[01:36:42.167 --> 01:36:46.590]  And I would love to see a different outcome than what I continue to see.
[01:36:47.531 --> 01:36:50.132]  This passiveness that seems to be crammed down our throats.
[01:36:50.712 --> 01:36:53.774]  And I'm going to tell you, I'm a white guy, and I'm proud of it.
[01:36:54.115 --> 01:37:00.679]  And this demasculinatizing of white men and telling us we can and we can't.
[01:37:00.819 --> 01:37:02.640]  And Alex, I know you're listening.
[01:37:03.362 --> 01:37:03.923]  We're at war.
[01:37:04.423 --> 01:37:05.624]  We are at war.
[01:37:06.144 --> 01:37:13.971]  At every angle, from the social media, to the computers, to the language, to everything we turn at, they have a full-on attack on us.
[01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:23.098]  And I'm telling you, just as a guy, and I'm on board with you, Alex, and I'll tell you what, wherever this ends up, you're going to find another man behind you, because I'm like that.
[01:37:23.358 --> 01:37:29.043]  And I don't know quite how to digest, you know, this tacitness and this, you know, I'm not that way.
[01:37:30.084 --> 01:37:34.251]  I know, brother, and you're calling into radio and I bet you're taking action locally.
[01:37:34.651 --> 01:37:36.554]  Get more aggressive in the information war.
[01:37:36.855 --> 01:37:37.816]  Get more people awake.
[01:37:37.996 --> 01:37:39.238]  Ignite the understanding.
[01:37:39.519 --> 01:37:41.802]  And then if things happen to get physical, we'll have the upper hand.
[01:37:42.042 --> 01:37:42.543]  God bless you.
[01:37:45.293 --> 01:37:46.574]  Our next guest is just popping in.
[01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.656]  We'll have him back up for a full hour in the next few weeks.
[01:37:49.136 --> 01:37:57.824]  He's Jan Ervin, and he's an author, researcher, well-known, the guy that got Joe Rogan into podcasting and got him his first take DMT.
[01:37:58.384 --> 01:37:59.185]  He's now a Christian.
[01:38:00.206 --> 01:38:02.388]  Thanks to some of the experience, I guess he had some of the demonic stuff.
[01:38:02.448 --> 01:38:05.050]  You can argue that either way, but he's warning you, don't take it.
[01:38:05.710 --> 01:38:06.691]  Well, guess what happened?
[01:38:06.711 --> 01:38:07.792]  Let me read his bio first.
[01:38:07.812 --> 01:38:10.895]  The video, the interview with me, went viral.
[01:38:11.035 --> 01:38:11.836]  He was on two days ago.
[01:38:13.504 --> 01:38:25.069]  And it was taken off his channel and many other channels on the internet for community guidelines violation, warning you about taking illegal drugs, ayahuasca, DMT, pointing out that there are groups and clinics in the U.S.
[01:38:25.649 --> 01:38:32.753]  giving people these drugs illegally in mass, and the government is fully aware of it, and then programming people into cults.
[01:38:33.635 --> 01:38:35.136]  You know, cults, they're not good things.
[01:38:35.836 --> 01:38:40.399]  So Jan Ervin is a forensic researcher, author, and podcast host.
[01:38:40.779 --> 01:39:00.431]  He currently hosts a live weekly show called Unspun, but it's banned on YouTube now, focusing on exposing the many social engineering and intelligence programs that have been running against the American public since our country's inception, including the Salem Witch Trials, the Royal Society, so-called science, music used for mind control, eugenics, mental slavery, diet, nutrition.
[01:39:00.771 --> 01:39:02.372]  His primary focus has been to expose
[01:39:03.499 --> 01:39:07.584]  The entirety of the 60s counterculture, the CIA, true MKUltra program.
[01:39:07.604 --> 01:39:08.686]  That's, by the way, declassified.
[01:39:08.726 --> 01:39:10.949]  I showed the Washington Post admitting it yesterday.
[01:39:10.989 --> 01:39:12.010]  In fact, let's pull that back up.
[01:39:12.511 --> 01:39:15.955]  Just type in Unabomber, Unabomber, MKUltra.
[01:39:20.549 --> 01:39:21.649]  Congressional hearings, everything.
[01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:33.651]  His shows are now in their 10th year, having done nearly 450 in-depth interviews as well as interviewed on 300 other programs including Infowars, Alex Jones, 2011 and again 2019.
[01:39:34.031 --> 01:39:35.672]  His website's at logosmedia.com.
[01:39:36.052 --> 01:39:37.652]  So he's popping in with us.
[01:39:37.692 --> 01:39:44.573]  We'll do a document cam shot for TV viewers because we did an interview.
[01:39:44.653 --> 01:39:47.594]  We talked about professors and others that admittedly work in CIA programs.
[01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:49.694]  We talked about Joe and how they took DMT together.
[01:39:50.862 --> 01:39:51.662]  Which Joe admits.
[01:39:52.463 --> 01:39:57.185]  He talked about his view that Joe is now the new Timothy Leary.
[01:39:57.465 --> 01:39:58.105]  Promoting this.
[01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:02.787]  And it was taken down off his channel in good standing for over a decade.
[01:40:04.548 --> 01:40:06.049]  And now his live streaming has been banned.
[01:40:07.489 --> 01:40:08.530]  Document cam shot please.
[01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:10.011]  Hi Logos Media.
[01:40:10.091 --> 01:40:12.312]  And they go on to say you violated the community guidelines.
[01:40:12.412 --> 01:40:12.632]  So.
[01:40:13.732 --> 01:40:14.953]  If you try to stop Google.
[01:40:16.664 --> 01:40:27.950]  With the Google executives admittedly obsessed with Iowaska DMT and the rest of it, and you tell folks that they might want to protect their kids from this, that's bad.
[01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:38.756]  Just like it's now bad if you don't want your five-year-old to be at school when they have Drag Queen Day, where a full-grown man comes in and shakes their butt and their face, and your child puts $5 bills in their G-string.
[01:40:39.256 --> 01:40:40.757]  That's obscene to not do that.
[01:40:41.513 --> 01:40:45.456]  So if you tell kids watch out for DMT or ayahuasca or cults, you're bad.
[01:40:45.876 --> 01:40:47.257]  Because Google is a cult.
[01:40:47.938 --> 01:40:49.058]  They are now banning the word family.
[01:40:49.639 --> 01:40:54.943]  As you may know, our community guidelines describe which content we allow and we don't allow on YouTube.
[01:40:55.263 --> 01:41:04.529]  Your video, AJ, first person to give DMT to Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo, reveals darkness behind the drug.
[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:04.830]  Wow!
[01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:09.612]  The darkness behind the drug, bad trips, bad experiences.
[01:41:10.112 --> 01:41:13.434]  My God, we're telling people not to take something way stronger than LSD.
[01:41:13.954 --> 01:41:15.274]  Wow, you can't allow that!
[01:41:15.294 --> 01:41:23.017]  I mean, Alex Jones doesn't want schools teaching four-year-old girls how to masturbate and insert dildos.
[01:41:24.377 --> 01:41:30.680]  Yeah, we can show you mainstream media teaching four- and five-year-old girls how to have sex with a machine.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.940]  And, you know, they take our videos down.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.341]  It's obscene to not teach.
[01:41:35.356 --> 01:41:36.937]  Little girls in school how to masturbate.
[01:41:37.278 --> 01:41:42.802]  Jocelyn Elder said, reach down and help them.
[01:41:43.162 --> 01:41:44.583]  She's the good person.
[01:41:45.604 --> 01:41:48.787]  Let the teachers touch your daughter's wee-wee.
[01:41:49.367 --> 01:41:51.569]  Let the teachers touch the pee-pee.
[01:41:52.309 --> 01:41:55.332]  Again folks, this is what goes on on television.
[01:41:56.786 --> 01:41:58.947]  Teach your son how to use a dildo.
[01:41:59.667 --> 01:42:01.388]  Teach your daughter how to use it.
[01:42:01.728 --> 01:42:03.049]  It's good.
[01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:07.091]  And if you're a local radio listener or whatever saying, this is crazy, we're streaming video of it now.
[01:42:07.411 --> 01:42:08.472]  TV stations are carrying it.
[01:42:08.672 --> 01:42:10.213]  You're saying, well, this shouldn't be seen.
[01:42:10.933 --> 01:42:13.474]  These are... I agree!
[01:42:13.714 --> 01:42:15.395]  Adult television shouldn't have this.
[01:42:15.675 --> 01:42:18.497]  This is being shown to children in public schools!
[01:42:19.617 --> 01:42:20.538]  This is the agenda.
[01:42:20.558 --> 01:42:20.678]  So...
[01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:22.832]  Get him on drugs.
[01:42:22.872 --> 01:42:24.274]  Get him sexualized at an early age.
[01:42:24.334 --> 01:42:26.476]  That's the oldest Julian Huxley plan.
[01:42:26.677 --> 01:42:27.978]  When we come back, we'll go to our guest.
[01:42:28.439 --> 01:42:30.241]  We've got to back the next guest up to 15 minutes.
[01:42:30.301 --> 01:42:31.763]  I want to get him on, but I promise the callers.
[01:42:32.143 --> 01:42:34.767]  We'll go to Julie, Diane, Mike, Robert, David, Jacob.
[01:42:34.787 --> 01:42:35.547]  I haven't even plugged yet.

[01:46:05.302 --> 01:46:08.264]  Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[01:46:09.585 --> 01:46:10.585]  And it's gonna happen now.
[01:46:11.065 --> 01:46:11.666]  Gonna happen now.
[01:46:11.706 --> 01:46:12.906]  Thank you very much everybody.
[01:46:13.507 --> 01:46:14.868]  Enjoy your food.
[01:46:15.088 --> 01:46:21.211]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candle stick holders with candles and then all this fast food.
[01:46:21.251 --> 01:46:22.372]  Trump is ridiculous.
[01:46:22.872 --> 01:46:24.313]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[01:46:26.767 --> 01:46:30.549]  But meanwhile, he says we've got burgers stacked a mile high.
[01:46:30.849 --> 01:46:33.731]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[01:46:34.652 --> 01:46:40.236]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners.
[01:46:40.856 --> 01:46:44.378]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him.
[01:46:44.458 --> 01:46:49.181]  And Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least, when he did.
[01:46:49.201 --> 01:46:49.702]  Oh, it's well known.
[01:46:49.742 --> 01:46:53.144]  Trump likes tacos, and Obama likes wieners.
[01:47:06.316 --> 01:47:08.924]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.462 --> 01:47:31.767]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.007 --> 01:47:37.791]  Well, Trump just recognized Guaido, who clearly won the last election, but the dictator didn't leave.
[01:47:38.572 --> 01:47:43.976]  Caracas Spring, not so fast, Venezuela's armed forces say, but it's basically collapsing martial law.
[01:47:43.996 --> 01:47:45.317]  They've been starving to death for years.
[01:47:46.077 --> 01:47:49.640]  The wonders of a government run by somebody like Alexandria Cortez.
[01:47:51.636 --> 01:47:54.621]  All right, I wanted to give him a chance to just pop in and respond to this.
[01:47:54.641 --> 01:47:55.703]  We're gonna go back to your calls.
[01:47:55.743 --> 01:47:59.569]  We have another huge guest joining us, another even bigger guest that we may be able to get on.
[01:47:59.609 --> 01:48:03.275]  So it's a jam-packed final few hours here, but I wanted to get
[01:48:05.902 --> 01:48:17.230]  This gentleman on because again, we did a very fair analysis report about DMT and about one of the top podcasts in the world with Joe Rogan just on every show.
[01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:18.511]  He had Mike Tyson on reportedly.
[01:48:18.551 --> 01:48:19.272]  I read the transcript.
[01:48:19.892 --> 01:48:21.233]  Just everybody should take it.
[01:48:21.293 --> 01:48:21.674]  It's great.
[01:48:21.754 --> 01:48:22.474]  Take DMT.
[01:48:22.514 --> 01:48:23.315]  Take ayahuasca.
[01:48:23.755 --> 01:48:28.980]  There's all these people calling themselves shaman, running cults everywhere, programming people with it right here in Austin.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.322]  People, I know, they're having a bad experience.
[01:48:31.342 --> 01:48:33.704]  I know a bunch of people who've died taking it.
[01:48:33.764 --> 01:48:34.464]  You hear about it all the time.
[01:48:34.784 --> 01:48:38.708]  Oh, we went down to Peru and died, or a guy died outside Dallas on it.
[01:48:39.448 --> 01:48:43.752]  And it's just crazy the stuff that's going on.
[01:48:43.772 --> 01:48:48.696]  Well, hey, the Aztecs thought it was wonderful, but oh, you violated the community guidelines.
[01:48:49.517 --> 01:48:50.498]  Jan Ervin.
[01:48:50.678 --> 01:48:53.199]  So thank you for joining us and now responding to this.
[01:48:53.419 --> 01:48:56.601]  We've posted the interview to InfoWars.com.
[01:48:56.861 --> 01:48:57.962]  Good luck getting it taken down.
[01:48:58.802 --> 01:49:00.563]  Joe's welcome to file a lawsuit if he wants.
[01:49:00.583 --> 01:49:02.244]  We can prove it all in court.
[01:49:02.645 --> 01:49:05.486]  See the censored Joe Rogan DMT expose.
[01:49:05.826 --> 01:49:09.949]  Find out why the intelligence agencies secretly promote the use of psychedelics.
[01:49:10.409 --> 01:49:13.271]  Good luck suppressing this, because all I'm going to do now
[01:49:14.091 --> 01:49:17.253]  Is I'm going to start releasing everything about Austin and everything else.
[01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:19.215]  So just get ready for that.
[01:49:19.415 --> 01:49:20.756]  Hope you enjoy all of it.
[01:49:20.996 --> 01:49:21.717]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:49:22.818 --> 01:49:25.480]  Yeah, you know, and we didn't even get into on it, etc.
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:34.546]  But, you know, Alex, in 2011, my channel was shut down one other time, and it was for broadcast.
[01:49:34.626 --> 01:49:42.232]  It was for broadcasting my own interview with Joe Rogan on my channel, and my channel was shut down for over a month because of that.
[01:49:42.692 --> 01:49:45.996]  And now my live feed has been shut down and this video pulled.
[01:49:46.437 --> 01:49:58.250]  I can't say it was because of him, but, you know, for warning kids away from doing drugs and, you know, I've got over 20 years of research in psychedelics, ethnobotany.
[01:49:58.651 --> 01:50:03.156]  I've renamed them to Suggestogens because they cause hypersuggestion.
[01:50:04.176 --> 01:50:13.426]  And, you know, I think it's absolutely absurd what community guideline was violated for warning kids not to do these substances.
[01:50:14.086 --> 01:50:17.109]  And, you know, it's just it's absolutely absurd.
[01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:19.091]  You know, you've got the thing up there on screen.
[01:50:19.452 --> 01:50:23.596]  But I have a small company and I run mostly on donations.
[01:50:24.116 --> 01:50:27.440]  You know, and so this affects my livelihood as well.
[01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:32.767]  And I appreciate your listeners for supporting my show and subscribing to my channel and everything.
[01:50:33.088 --> 01:50:36.932]  They didn't pull my channel down this time, but they did kill my live feed.
[01:50:37.173 --> 01:50:41.919]  I had a, you know, right before my show last night with Lloyd DeYoung.
[01:50:42.639 --> 01:50:44.301]  That's the message.
[01:50:44.421 --> 01:50:45.282]  That's the message is...
[01:51:02.819 --> 01:51:07.582]  Don't get in the way of Google and its ayahuasca DMT cult pushing.
[01:51:07.923 --> 01:51:10.644]  Because we know Google's obsessed with taking hallucinogens.
[01:51:11.005 --> 01:51:12.506]  We know San Francisco is.
[01:51:12.566 --> 01:51:13.466]  This is their cult.
[01:51:13.947 --> 01:51:15.388]  This is how cults control people.
[01:51:15.448 --> 01:51:16.488]  This is mind control.
[01:51:16.969 --> 01:51:18.830]  This is how these people operate.
[01:51:20.236 --> 01:51:30.526]  Yeah, you know, and, uh, you know, I even had guys that I know were key players behind MKUltra, like this guy, uh, uh, James Martinez contacts me yesterday.
[01:51:30.566 --> 01:51:31.847]  He worked with Walter Boward.
[01:51:31.887 --> 01:51:33.669]  He worked with Dr. Andrea Pujaric.
[01:51:34.029 --> 01:51:37.793]  He was part of the Council of Nine that we talked about on our, our shows.
[01:51:37.853 --> 01:51:43.198]  Worked with guys like Yuri Geller, etc., who admitted on, on Red Ice years ago that he was CIA.
[01:51:43.758 --> 01:52:02.628]  But, you know, these guys were tied, you know, this guy's tied in from several different directions from what he even admitted to me in his email to me and he's threatening, you know, to go on your show and he's going to write a letter exposing me as a fraud and all of this stuff, you know, but he doesn't even realize the level of research that I have in MKUltra and these guys.
[01:52:02.688 --> 01:52:06.612]  If I was you, I wouldn't worry about all these little guys, okay, that are all trying to have their own deal.
[01:52:07.033 --> 01:52:08.755]  We have the Washington Post on screen.
[01:52:08.835 --> 01:52:12.199]  CIA infiltrated 17 area groups, gave out LSD, okay.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:15.202]  Theodore Kaczynski was in the MKL for migrant program.
[01:52:15.542 --> 01:52:19.407]  A bunch of the professors you list are admittedly in programs funded by DARPA and the CIA.
[01:52:19.687 --> 01:52:22.070]  Timothy Leary admitted it all, that the whole thing was run by that.
[01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:22.850]  Absolutely.
[01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:37.855]  So again, they want it down because they are now proliferating quote self-help groups all over the country under different names that are practicing classical mind control to try to induct particularly wealthy people into their church.
[01:52:38.275 --> 01:52:38.875]  That's what it is.
[01:52:38.976 --> 01:52:45.818]  Okay, this is all about power and all about you take you're not on ayahuasca, you're not on DMT, but you get somebody
[01:52:46.798 --> 01:52:49.399]  Intuitive's never done it, and then they think you're God.
[01:52:49.459 --> 01:52:50.639]  They think you're their shaman.
[01:52:50.719 --> 01:52:51.980]  They worship you.
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.380]  This is the oldest thing.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:56.341]  This is what Charlie Manson did with LSD and his cult.
[01:52:56.601 --> 01:52:57.122]  Period!
[01:52:57.662 --> 01:52:57.982]  Period!
[01:52:58.042 --> 01:52:58.542]  Absolutely.
[01:52:58.762 --> 01:53:15.948]  You know, and Joe, or excuse me, Alex, just to mention, is from my research, in my opinion, it appears that the Esalen Institute up in Big Sur, Northern California, is who is behind a lot of this stuff, and they're tied in with SRI, the CIA, all of these other groups, you know, and
[01:53:17.032 --> 01:53:26.397]  Esslin was co-founded by Aldous Huxley, who, as I have exposed, you know, repeatedly for years, was the key architect behind MKUltra.
[01:53:26.417 --> 01:53:34.501]  And I even had Commander General Albert Stubblebine on my show in 2013 admitting my research on this.
[01:53:34.721 --> 01:53:37.202]  And he ran the Pentagon's operations in this.
[01:53:37.602 --> 01:53:38.223]  Absolutely.
[01:53:38.923 --> 01:53:39.143]  Yep.
[01:53:39.363 --> 01:53:41.405]  And, you know, he confirmed it on my show as well.
[01:53:41.445 --> 01:53:43.327]  But they do not want this stuff out.
[01:53:44.027 --> 01:53:46.950]  And, uh, you know, they're trying to, you know, they're throttled.
[01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:48.911]  They've shadow banned my account.
[01:53:48.951 --> 01:53:53.615]  They shadow banned my Facebook pages, all of my websites and searches.
[01:53:53.675 --> 01:53:54.235]  Let's be clear.
[01:53:54.856 --> 01:53:55.717]  They're saying, hey,
[01:53:56.477 --> 01:53:57.699]  One more strike, you're gone.
[01:53:57.939 --> 01:53:59.621]  You don't put this interview up, buddy.
[01:54:00.081 --> 01:54:07.930]  You sit there and you take it and you shut up and you let us go on there and have Joe say, oh, he's attacking Sandy Hook families right now.
[01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:10.072]  He's going to be taken off air when I'm not doing that.
[01:54:10.112 --> 01:54:14.577]  It's the left attacking families and doxing the Catholic youth and saying, go attack them.
[01:54:14.838 --> 01:54:15.919]  And then they won't take the Twitter down.
[01:54:15.939 --> 01:54:16.740]  So see, so see.
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:34.369]  Oh, I'm Alex's friend, but he's crazy and nuts and full of crap and, you know, yeah, he's being sued so he can't be on air and, you know, the censorship's okay, blah, blah, blah, and I'm just supposed to go, oh, that's okay, you're just the advertising arm of a giant DMT cult, an ayahuasca cult operating across the U.S.
[01:54:34.649 --> 01:54:40.192]  and now transnationally, so I'm just gonna sit here and let you sit up on your high horse and explain to me how to cowlick the cabbage.
[01:54:40.392 --> 01:54:42.973]  I'm just gonna roll over and die while you crap all over me.
[01:54:43.133 --> 01:54:44.074]  No, that's not how it works.
[01:54:45.564 --> 01:54:46.064]  Absolutely.
[01:54:46.164 --> 01:54:46.885]  Same thing to me.
[01:54:46.945 --> 01:54:48.886]  I mean, you and I were both friends with him.
[01:54:48.966 --> 01:54:52.688]  I was friends with him for almost a decade and, you know, same stuff.
[01:54:53.369 --> 01:54:57.351]  And he thinks I'm just going to roll over and watch him, you know,
[01:54:59.870 --> 01:55:08.232]  Defame me, slander me, claim that my research is bogus, that he disproved it with Dennis McKenna, etc.
[01:55:08.252 --> 01:55:09.013]  It's nonsense.
[01:55:09.053 --> 01:55:09.553]  They haven't.
[01:55:09.993 --> 01:55:22.196]  All they did was name-call, use appeals to ridicule, have hit pieces, ran, as far as I can tell, with Simon Powell, with Daniel Penchbeck, with Iona Miller and all these people.
[01:55:22.216 --> 01:55:26.418]  And I've shown how these people were working behind the scenes.
[01:55:27.898 --> 01:55:28.859]  Well, let's stop there.
[01:55:28.879 --> 01:55:29.439]  Let's stop there.
[01:55:29.459 --> 01:55:30.360]  Because you obsess.
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:31.621]  The literature is all there.
[01:55:31.641 --> 01:55:34.383]  We should just get into the history of it and then the current stuff when you come back.
[01:55:34.543 --> 01:55:38.385]  Because you're into, like, mentioning these people that don't matter, that are side issues.
[01:55:39.066 --> 01:55:40.527]  Joe's the big mothership.
[01:55:40.587 --> 01:55:41.488]  He's the brain bug.
[01:55:41.508 --> 01:55:44.370]  He's the guy that, you know, he's the guy that
[01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:46.131]  Pulls them all in, okay?
[01:55:46.571 --> 01:55:48.132]  And so, we're going to expose it.
[01:55:48.893 --> 01:55:53.355]  The article that, the video that's censored is on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:53.375 --> 01:55:55.276]  Let's put it back on screen right now.
[01:55:55.777 --> 01:55:56.597]  InfoWars.com.
[01:55:56.617 --> 01:55:57.438]  We have our own servers.
[01:55:57.738 --> 01:55:58.759]  We have our own platforms.
[01:55:59.159 --> 01:55:59.559]  It's there.
[01:56:00.059 --> 01:56:02.261]  InfoWars.com.
[01:56:02.941 --> 01:56:04.602]  InfoWars.com.
[01:56:04.962 --> 01:56:08.044]  See the censored Joe Rogan DMT expose.
[01:56:08.424 --> 01:56:08.865]  Spread it.
[01:56:09.725 --> 01:56:10.045]  Use it.
[01:56:10.486 --> 01:56:12.968]  Last time I tried to censor something, we got 14 million views.
[01:56:13.208 --> 01:56:14.149]  Believe me, I had to pay for it.
[01:56:14.989 --> 01:56:16.330]  14 million views when drugs linked to it.
[01:56:16.651 --> 01:56:21.134]  So, everybody, get the expose they don't want you to see at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:21.214 --> 01:56:22.435]  It's absolutely free.
[01:56:22.615 --> 01:56:24.977]  Hey, Jan Ervin, we'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:56:24.997 --> 01:56:26.258]  God bless you.
[01:56:26.278 --> 01:56:27.339]  Thank you for having me back, Alex.
[01:56:27.439 --> 01:56:27.839]  You bet.
[01:56:28.059 --> 01:56:29.781]  It's quite the experience, isn't it?
[01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:31.322]  It is, you know.
[01:56:31.642 --> 01:56:32.162]  It really is.
[01:56:32.263 --> 01:56:33.283]  Thank you again so much.
[01:56:33.524 --> 01:56:34.564]  Well, we'll talk again soon.
[01:56:34.704 --> 01:56:35.145]  Here's the deal.
[01:56:35.425 --> 01:56:36.466]  I'm not backing down.
[01:56:37.648 --> 01:56:37.928]  Okay.
[01:56:38.489 --> 01:56:41.912]  And my whole, you know, operation is not attacking Joe Rogan.
[01:56:41.952 --> 01:56:44.253]  And it's not because he didn't have me back on his podcast.
[01:56:44.994 --> 01:56:48.917]  It's because I already kind of knew all this and then it all just came together and what I learned locally.
[01:56:49.338 --> 01:56:52.780]  And then I just sat back and looked at it and him doing the talking points, the establishment.
[01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:57.024]  And then I learned about he's going and visiting with these certain professors that are telling him what to say and what to do.
[01:56:58.165 --> 01:56:59.085]  Joe is compromised.
[01:57:01.437 --> 01:57:08.319]  I got bigger fish to fry if he wasn't sitting there gunning at me and doing all this.
[01:57:08.359 --> 01:57:09.059]  So, fine.
[01:57:09.799 --> 01:57:10.460]  I'm not rolling over.
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.000]  You want to fight?
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:12.760]  Better believe you got one now.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:18.402]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, your financial support is now more critical than ever, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:18.982 --> 01:57:23.047]  We're fighting so they don't teach five-year-olds how to give blowjobs in schools and masturbate.
[01:57:23.388 --> 01:57:23.788]  That's right.
[01:57:23.888 --> 01:57:27.152]  We're fighting so that they're not forcibly inoculating you and you don't have to eat GMO.
[01:57:27.533 --> 01:57:30.497]  We're fighting to make sure our borders aren't open to radical jihadis and islamists.
[01:57:30.817 --> 01:57:35.143]  We're fighting to make sure that people aren't pushing DMT and ayahuasca on schoolchildren.
[01:57:35.623 --> 01:57:40.624]  We need you to buy products at Infowarslife.com that are high quality and great, like our new TurboForce.
[01:57:40.904 --> 01:57:45.125]  It is the ultimate beyond pre-workout, beyond energy drink, beyond everything.
[01:57:45.205 --> 01:57:47.886]  It's the total fusion and the best out there in the world.
[01:57:48.126 --> 01:57:48.786]  TurboForce!
[01:57:48.926 --> 01:57:50.366]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:57:50.546 --> 01:57:51.227]  TurboForce!
[01:57:53.867 --> 01:57:54.387]  Here's the thing.
[01:57:54.447 --> 01:57:55.828]  I know how metaphysics works.
[01:57:55.908 --> 01:57:57.048]  I know how the universe works.
[01:57:57.708 --> 01:57:59.788]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:58:00.989 --> 01:58:02.169]  If you're not expanding,
[01:58:03.848 --> 01:58:04.569]  You're imploding.
[01:58:05.169 --> 01:58:07.591]  There is no set stasis.
[01:58:09.112 --> 01:58:10.333]  There is no managed system.
[01:58:11.554 --> 01:58:15.036]  There is no... ...uncontinuum.
[01:58:15.857 --> 01:58:21.521]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[01:58:21.581 --> 01:58:30.027]  So... I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[01:58:31.297 --> 01:58:32.658]  And that would be a very true statement.
[01:58:33.518 --> 01:58:39.661]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[01:58:40.742 --> 01:58:45.625]  If I fight as hard as I can, and people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[01:58:47.105 --> 01:58:52.228]  You support us and get creative and get fired up, we won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[01:58:52.628 --> 01:58:53.709]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[01:58:54.881 --> 01:59:03.091]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[01:59:03.472 --> 01:59:08.918]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[01:59:08.958 --> 01:59:10.400]  Like Christ said, I have other flocks.
[01:59:11.281 --> 01:59:11.742]  It's a lot of...
[01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.550]  God's big.
[01:59:13.650 --> 01:59:15.071]  God makes a lot of stuff, you know?
[01:59:15.552 --> 01:59:17.313]  And, you know, I want to be on the winning team.
[01:59:17.393 --> 01:59:19.354]  I want to like, hey, hey, come on in.
[01:59:19.714 --> 01:59:20.114]  You made it.
[01:59:20.495 --> 01:59:21.075]  Good to have you here.
[01:59:21.795 --> 01:59:28.239]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.941]  And so this is playland.
[01:59:31.021 --> 01:59:32.062]  This is baby town.
[01:59:32.602 --> 01:59:33.383]  This is dress up.
[01:59:33.403 --> 01:59:36.144]  This is like little boys playing soldier in the woods.
[01:59:36.785 --> 01:59:39.747]  All I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[01:59:40.707 --> 01:59:41.728]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:59:42.762 --> 01:59:46.123]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[01:59:46.143 --> 01:59:47.704]  Not these devil worshippers.
[01:59:47.724 --> 01:59:50.425]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[01:59:50.585 --> 01:59:51.445]  I want life!
[01:59:51.985 --> 01:59:52.866]  I want Jesus!
[01:59:52.886 --> 02:00:00.288]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.388 --> 02:00:02.369]  I can't stop me, dear.
[02:00:11.551 --> 02:00:16.773]  Well, let me tell you who, and I know one of the members of Who is a big listener.
[02:00:16.833 --> 02:00:17.313]  Big one.
[02:00:17.353 --> 02:00:18.154]  Sheek no longer.
[02:00:18.194 --> 02:00:19.574]  Because I got the answers.
[02:00:40.464 --> 02:00:43.326]  Timothy Leary, a little CIA, FBI bugaboo.
[02:00:43.346 --> 02:00:47.330]  Doesn't mean I have all the answers, but I've got the next level.
[02:00:48.150 --> 02:00:49.291]  I've been to the next level.
[02:00:49.752 --> 02:00:50.772]  I know the enemy operation.
[02:00:50.812 --> 02:00:51.473]  I know how to defeat them.
[02:00:53.154 --> 02:00:53.815]  I got their number.
[02:00:54.716 --> 02:00:59.239]  And all it takes is courage to take action, and your consciousness will be opened up.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.101]  It is taking on evil that opens the consciousness.
[02:01:02.901 --> 02:01:07.884]  Not hanging around with a bunch of ass-wipe hippies that like to carry their little CIA cards in their back pocket.
[02:01:08.164 --> 02:01:11.186]  Julie and Diane and Mike, I apologize that our callers are hung up.
[02:01:11.407 --> 02:01:13.348]  I got to a lot of people, but thanks for holding.
[02:01:13.408 --> 02:01:14.709]  Julie in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:01:16.178 --> 02:01:16.758]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:17.238 --> 02:01:21.480]  I wanted to talk about some angle that has not been spoken.
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:29.462]  I know everybody has been talking about the Covington kids and their hat, but there's another angle I wanted to mention to you.
[02:01:30.022 --> 02:01:45.627]  The other reason why the mainstream media is attacking those kids is because those kids are traditional Catholics and their parents who did not drink the Kool-Aid of Pope Francis' rhetoric against nationalism.
[02:01:46.963 --> 02:01:47.503]  No, you're right.
[02:01:47.544 --> 02:01:50.526]  There are a lot of traditional Catholics that I know that are really great people.
[02:01:50.546 --> 02:01:53.909]  You know, they demonize Mel Gibson, but his dad is one, and all these other people.
[02:01:54.389 --> 02:02:03.436]  And I guess this is a traditional Catholic school, and I guess that's why they're so well-behaved compared to... Yes, I'm a traditional Catholic myself, Alex.
[02:02:03.997 --> 02:02:08.801]  And I noticed that the Archdiocese where these kids are from, the Bishop,
[02:02:09.381 --> 02:02:11.863]  ...took the side of the provocateur.
[02:02:12.323 --> 02:02:17.766]  That bishop is in line with the same mentality of Pope Francis.
[02:02:20.273 --> 02:02:20.854]  No, you're right.
[02:02:20.934 --> 02:02:28.400]  And again, that's the whole pedophile rings that they've sent to the Catholic Church to take it over, which has caused a split with all these conservative groups that I would say is the real Catholic Church.
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:34.965]  And everybody should just leave these big, rotting, evil churches that have been taken over until they collapse, then you can take them back over.
[02:02:35.305 --> 02:02:40.129]  But the money people give the official Vatican, the Vatican has been captured.
[02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:45.434]  There's no doubt, any way you slice it, it's been captured by the globalists, and you're absolutely right.
[02:02:47.102 --> 02:02:50.363]  And to also talk about President Trump's national emergency.
[02:02:51.003 --> 02:02:52.283]  Yes, he should declare it.
[02:02:52.443 --> 02:02:58.464]  I have a friend of mine in the border city where I live, and she is a nurse in the county jail.
[02:02:58.484 --> 02:03:05.265]  A couple of months ago, she told me that they detained three Turkish men on the border.
[02:03:06.326 --> 02:03:07.686]  They had to get an interpreter.
[02:03:08.186 --> 02:03:10.346]  They were asked, do you have family here?
[02:03:10.887 --> 02:03:11.067]  No.
[02:03:11.667 --> 02:03:12.647]  Do you have friends here?
[02:03:13.067 --> 02:03:13.167]  No.
[02:03:13.959 --> 02:03:14.860]  Well, Julie,
[02:03:31.454 --> 02:03:41.526]  It's on record that they capture thousands a month or even a week of other than quote Mexicans what they call them in the border patrol and thousands and thousands and thousands a year are from Islamic countries.
[02:03:42.027 --> 02:03:42.808]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:03:42.828 --> 02:03:44.350]  God bless you and thanks for your great point.
[02:03:44.410 --> 02:03:44.690]  Yes.
[02:03:45.952 --> 02:03:50.417]  That's another reason they hate these kids is that
[02:03:51.536 --> 02:03:54.198]  They're traditional Catholics, which have definitely been targeted.
[02:03:54.218 --> 02:04:01.102]  You know, notice as soon as Pope, this current Pope took over, oh, then the liberal media suddenly loved the Catholic Church.
[02:04:01.122 --> 02:04:08.066]  And oh, it's so good because this Pope is about as close to the devil as I could ever imagine with the rhetoric he puts out.
[02:04:09.087 --> 02:04:16.411]  Oh, and he says Europe's got to have open borders and it nauseates him to hear about Christian roots of Europe and how we should open Europe up to the Islamists.
[02:04:16.431 --> 02:04:17.632]  But he doesn't open up the Vatican.
[02:04:18.653 --> 02:04:18.753]  No.
[02:04:20.558 --> 02:04:21.199]  Truly insane.
[02:04:21.259 --> 02:04:25.402]  Okay, Diane says an 85-year-old Infowarrior.
[02:04:25.422 --> 02:04:26.303]  So thanks for holding on.
[02:04:26.323 --> 02:04:26.983]  I didn't even notice that.
[02:04:27.023 --> 02:04:27.944]  That would have gone to you first.
[02:04:28.685 --> 02:04:30.566]  And then Mike in California, Trump National Emergency.
[02:04:30.587 --> 02:04:31.888]  And then we have our next guest joining us.
[02:04:32.808 --> 02:04:36.131]  And we have another special guest we're working on that might be popping in.
[02:04:36.151 --> 02:04:38.353]  But we'll find out as that unfolds.
[02:04:38.373 --> 02:04:40.295]  But I'm definitely fired up here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:40.915 --> 02:04:42.276]  I wonder why I get so hyper and fired up.
[02:04:42.316 --> 02:04:44.698]  If you're going to take these folks on, I can't help it.
[02:04:44.718 --> 02:04:45.799]  I just get fired up when I do it.
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:47.461]  Because I get in fighting mode.
[02:04:47.701 --> 02:04:48.522]  Because we're in a fight.
[02:04:49.531 --> 02:04:54.095]  So thanks for putting up with me, but whatever you do, realize the power of you, the listener.
[02:04:54.155 --> 02:05:00.059]  Leveraging InfoWars.com and sending people to InfoWars.com forward slash show is unstoppable.
[02:05:00.099 --> 02:05:01.020]  So please take action.
[02:05:06.263 --> 02:05:08.965]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:05:09.305 --> 02:05:15.210]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:27.739]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[02:05:39.942 --> 02:05:42.863]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:05:44.804 --> 02:05:47.425]  Perfect for work in the car or at home.
[02:05:47.965 --> 02:05:50.746]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:05:51.206 --> 02:05:52.607]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:06:05.932 --> 02:06:19.462]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:28.663 --> 02:06:34.248]  All right, I'm gonna finish up with some of your calls, hit some of the other key big breaking news, then we got our next guest coming up.
[02:06:34.809 --> 02:06:36.030]  I'll tell you about when he joins us.
[02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:37.251]  Andrew Tate.
[02:06:40.267 --> 02:06:41.208]  But this just broke.
[02:06:41.288 --> 02:06:43.489]  Caracas is basically falling in Venezuela.
[02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:49.453]  The president here has recognized the opposition leader that many experts believe won the last election.
[02:06:49.473 --> 02:06:58.118]  Venezuela is now a one-party dictatorship of the communists who came to power as liberals and then said they were socialists and then said they were communists.
[02:06:58.578 --> 02:07:00.339]  Over a thousand people a day starved to death.
[02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:04.922]  But they passed a law three years ago that you cannot call it starvation.
[02:07:06.203 --> 02:07:07.644]  They've long since ate their dogs.
[02:07:09.113 --> 02:07:09.753]  And they're cats.
[02:07:10.793 --> 02:07:12.254]  So it's very, very, very, very sad.
[02:07:12.334 --> 02:07:17.455]  Once the richest country in South America.
[02:07:19.096 --> 02:07:19.776]  Very, very sad.
[02:07:19.816 --> 02:07:25.217]  But thousands are coming our way and they get pulled by different agencies and they're still communist.
[02:07:25.297 --> 02:07:28.318]  They just heard there's a better communist place up to the north.
[02:07:28.638 --> 02:07:30.099]  Oh, they love our milk and honey.
[02:07:31.359 --> 02:07:33.300]  But then they get brainwashed by the left.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:34.780]  It's the curse of Latin America.
[02:07:36.601 --> 02:07:42.182]  Latin America was doing great until socialism and communism hit, and boy, didn't do too well.
[02:07:43.283 --> 02:07:49.304]  Michael Cohen postpones congressional testimony, claims threats from President Trump and Rudy Giuliani.
[02:07:49.924 --> 02:07:50.664]  This just broke.
[02:07:50.704 --> 02:07:52.005]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:07:52.045 --> 02:07:52.825]  It's USA Today.
[02:07:52.845 --> 02:08:02.687]  I'm going to talk to Diane and Mike, and then I'm going to get to the story, because it's just so crazy how anything Cohen says is taken by the media like God said it.
[02:08:04.673 --> 02:08:17.956]  He's a convicted liar and a convicted scammer who now is singing like a canary after he said Trump didn't do all these things to now try to get out of prison, to get a shorter sentence.
[02:08:18.877 --> 02:08:20.157]  It's truly disgusting.
[02:08:21.337 --> 02:08:24.698]  But people that I know that know him, it's kind of a blackmail against the president.
[02:08:26.218 --> 02:08:28.219]  They say Cohen is like mentally retarded.
[02:08:30.911 --> 02:08:32.913]  I was talking to someone that knows him very, very well.
[02:08:32.933 --> 02:08:37.156]  He said, listen, the problem with Trump is he's smart in ways, like an idiot savant.
[02:08:37.296 --> 02:08:38.137]  He cares about the country.
[02:08:38.157 --> 02:08:41.620]  But he said, man, he hires people and they lie to him.
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:43.341]  And then he has to figure it out later.
[02:08:43.922 --> 02:08:48.105]  But he goes, I know Michael Cohen and he's literally retarded.
[02:08:50.247 --> 02:08:50.847]  I go, what do you mean?
[02:08:50.887 --> 02:08:54.510]  He goes, he's one of the dumbest people I've ever met or talked to.
[02:08:54.571 --> 02:08:55.832]  And I've worked with him quite a bit.
[02:08:56.952 --> 02:08:57.673]  I talked to others.
[02:08:57.753 --> 02:08:58.173]  He's like,
[02:08:59.167 --> 02:09:01.248]  Lobotomized Winnie the Pooh or something.
[02:09:02.108 --> 02:09:04.129]  Diane in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:09:04.289 --> 02:09:04.669]  Welcome.
[02:09:04.689 --> 02:09:06.270]  Says you're an 85-year-old info warrior.
[02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:07.711]  Welcome and thanks for holding.
[02:09:09.291 --> 02:09:09.832]  Thank you.
[02:09:10.732 --> 02:09:11.752]  So what's on your mind today?
[02:09:13.533 --> 02:09:19.576]  I think if Trump declares an emergency, it'll just be delayed and blocked in the court.
[02:09:19.936 --> 02:09:23.237]  And I think Trump has very unique timing and strategies.
[02:09:23.817 --> 02:09:27.259]  And I think he should just go grab the military and build the wall.
[02:09:28.232 --> 02:09:30.633]  And release all the documents.
[02:09:32.454 --> 02:09:32.914]  That's it.
[02:09:33.374 --> 02:09:37.896]  Well sure, remember when Congress told Obama not to open the border up, but he just did it with executive power?
[02:09:39.336 --> 02:09:41.077]  The president can ignore the courts.
[02:09:42.315 --> 02:09:48.439]  The president could ignore the court so they can try to impeach him for it, but would he be convicted of more caravans slamming in, the drugs, the killing?
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:58.205]  If some judge, how is a judge in the judiciary, in another branch of the government, how are they able to tell the president what he can do as commander in chief?
[02:09:58.245 --> 02:09:58.626]  They can't.
[02:09:59.366 --> 02:10:04.948]  It's Congress that has to indict him in the House, convict him in the Senate, and they have to prove it's illegal or wrong.
[02:10:05.048 --> 02:10:08.409]  It's in the Constitution, it's in the Bill of Rights, it's in emergency powers.
[02:10:08.789 --> 02:10:13.571]  Protecting the border from invasion is the most sacrosanct thing a president can do.
[02:10:14.291 --> 02:10:15.272]  But I see your point.
[02:10:15.292 --> 02:10:19.093]  The media said, oh, the courts will just nullify it.
[02:10:19.933 --> 02:10:20.153]  Really?
[02:10:20.193 --> 02:10:21.214]  Like his travel ban?
[02:10:22.436 --> 02:10:27.238]  Which by the way stayed in effect until it was heard and then the Supreme Court finally said no, it's totally constitutional.
[02:10:27.499 --> 02:10:30.060]  The letter of the law was crisp and black and white.
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:31.801]  The President had that power.
[02:10:31.841 --> 02:10:35.883]  But aren't we in an emergency now with the shutdown killing the economy?
[02:10:37.263 --> 02:10:38.064]  We've been in it.
[02:10:39.604 --> 02:10:41.285]  And I agree with you totally.
[02:10:42.346 --> 02:10:43.646]  How long have you been listening, Diane?
[02:10:45.467 --> 02:10:48.969]  Probably about 15 years or better.
[02:10:50.148 --> 02:10:51.909]  Well, you're sure sweet to put up with me.
[02:10:52.429 --> 02:10:54.229]  So how is Washington State?
[02:10:56.010 --> 02:10:59.591]  Well, you know, Alex, I just moved here a year ago.
[02:10:59.831 --> 02:11:04.633]  I lived up in Oregon in the forest off the grid for 20 years.
[02:11:05.413 --> 02:11:07.353]  And I just moved up here recently.
[02:11:09.334 --> 02:11:11.055]  Well, you know me, I'm constantly interrupting.
[02:11:11.115 --> 02:11:12.555]  I'm always wound up like a top.
[02:11:12.595 --> 02:11:14.936]  But what else do you think about what's happening in the world?
[02:11:16.758 --> 02:11:27.243]  I think that they should have protected all of those kids from that Catholic school, and I think they should keep them off the radios, and the parents should protect them.
[02:11:27.283 --> 02:11:31.945]  They're not prepared for the badgering they're going to get on all of these negative shows.
[02:11:32.666 --> 02:11:37.928]  And I think the local police should have gone in and protected them from day one.
[02:11:37.948 --> 02:11:45.612]  Can you believe how the corporate media knew that they were harassed and death-threatened by this group of
[02:11:47.003 --> 02:11:56.912]  And then they edited the tape, said destroy them to try to bully and intimidate people, had Democrats say it should be outlawed for under 18 to wear a Make America Great Again hat.
[02:11:57.332 --> 02:11:58.433]  Talk about authoritarianism.
[02:11:59.694 --> 02:12:00.755]  Banning wearing a red hat.
[02:12:00.775 --> 02:12:06.820]  If you read that in a science fiction book, like in the year 2019, there'll be attempts to ban red hats that said Make America Great Again.
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:11.324]  You'd think it was a Kurt Vonnegut, you know, dark satire comedy novel.
[02:12:11.964 --> 02:12:13.145]  But this is really happening.
[02:12:14.738 --> 02:12:16.619]  The media still hasn't told the whole story.
[02:12:16.639 --> 02:12:20.281]  They're like, well, were they right to have a standoff with the native?
[02:12:20.361 --> 02:12:21.121]  He's God.
[02:12:21.642 --> 02:12:23.323]  They don't talk about the death threading and everything.
[02:12:23.343 --> 02:12:24.003]  That's what's amazing.
[02:12:25.744 --> 02:12:32.228]  Well, I think they just push everything out there they can to intimidate people, like their language that we can use and everything.
[02:12:32.588 --> 02:12:35.169]  But I think people capitulate to that and they shouldn't.
[02:12:35.229 --> 02:12:41.933]  They should just go ahead and do what they think is right and not inform to what the media is putting out there.
[02:12:43.732 --> 02:12:48.874]  Well, now that we've seen this young man, he's 13, 14 years old, on television, they're calling incarnate devil.
[02:12:49.334 --> 02:12:52.415]  He just is so well-spoken and nice and looks like a baby.
[02:12:53.016 --> 02:13:03.760]  And to think about a bunch of crazed, racist nuts screaming and yelling at people as young as seven, and little girls were in there too, but they went to the back.
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:08.942]  And to have the media then target these people so viciously shows you
[02:13:10.051 --> 02:13:14.693]  The evil, twisted frenzy of deception that the corporate globalist media is engaged in.
[02:13:15.093 --> 02:13:19.114]  God bless you, Diane, and thank you for your 15 years of support and listenership.
[02:13:19.134 --> 02:13:19.975]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:13:20.615 --> 02:13:24.737]  OK, last caller before I go to our guest, and that's Mike in California.
[02:13:25.377 --> 02:13:26.377]  Mike, thanks for joining us.
[02:13:27.658 --> 02:13:28.178]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:13:28.438 --> 02:13:29.578]  Again, I appreciate your call.
[02:13:29.919 --> 02:13:37.261]  And just before I make a few points, I just want to let you know that you have the best listeners out there, truly informed people.
[02:13:38.662 --> 02:13:38.822]  I do.
[02:13:40.157 --> 02:13:46.501]  And I also want to just let the president know that, you know, we need the wall.
[02:13:47.342 --> 02:13:50.944]  I live in California and it's getting ugly out here.
[02:13:53.406 --> 02:13:58.989]  Well, everybody I know, rich and poor from California, tells me that it's getting scary.
[02:13:59.009 --> 02:14:00.030]  I mean, how would you describe it?
[02:14:02.772 --> 02:14:04.753]  Unless you live in California, you really don't know.
[02:14:04.993 --> 02:14:09.416]  But it seems the closer and closer these caravans get to the border,
[02:14:10.402 --> 02:14:14.424]  The immigrants that are already here are like basking in joy.
[02:14:14.484 --> 02:14:19.447]  It's like they have a deeper sense of entitlement to the welfare system.
[02:14:19.467 --> 02:14:26.171]  And they don't fully realize what they're doing to destabilize our system here.
[02:14:26.291 --> 02:14:28.993]  But I mean, they're poor people.
[02:14:29.093 --> 02:14:31.494]  Like you said, most of them are low IQ.
[02:14:31.694 --> 02:14:34.156]  They don't really see what they're doing to our country.
[02:14:34.676 --> 02:14:35.997]  But they're breaking us apart.
[02:14:38.117 --> 02:14:39.298]  Well, it's a military plan.
[02:14:39.758 --> 02:14:40.218]  The U.N.
[02:14:40.258 --> 02:14:49.662]  runs it officially, and Trump is giving the defense the Democrats tried to do eight years ago, and they fought with the Republicans and couldn't get it done, because Republicans wanted a more hardcore plan.
[02:14:50.262 --> 02:14:54.844]  Trump's asking for half of what Nancy Pelosi asked for seven, eight years ago.
[02:14:54.864 --> 02:14:56.725]  And so this is it.
[02:14:56.885 --> 02:15:01.647]  I mean, folks, Mexico's now capitulated.
[02:15:02.187 --> 02:15:03.308]  Their border is now open.
[02:15:04.133 --> 02:15:08.578]  And so now the giant exodus out of countries that are hell on earth.
[02:15:08.678 --> 02:15:16.546]  And the people that are machinists or doctors or lawyers or mechanics or farmers, they are staying.
[02:15:16.947 --> 02:15:23.394]  And the very most criminal, desperate, mentally ill, insane are coming.
[02:15:24.255 --> 02:15:25.676]  And just think about that.
[02:15:26.522 --> 02:15:27.483]  Just think about that.
[02:15:27.523 --> 02:15:32.848]  I mean, people say, oh, we have the Cuban crime wave in the 80s, you know, when Castro was dumping out his prisons.
[02:15:32.868 --> 02:15:35.471]  A lot of his prisons were people that weren't communists.
[02:15:35.491 --> 02:15:36.292]  They were actually good.
[02:15:37.333 --> 02:15:39.755]  I'll take people out of Phil Castro's prisons.
[02:15:40.016 --> 02:15:40.856]  They should get amnesty.
[02:15:41.237 --> 02:15:46.002]  We don't want, though, the very bottom of the barrel as Latin America collapses.
[02:15:46.042 --> 02:15:46.742]  Great points, Mike.
[02:15:46.762 --> 02:15:47.323]  God bless you.
[02:15:47.343 --> 02:15:48.804]  I hear a little bit of crack in your voice.
[02:15:48.904 --> 02:15:50.246]  It's very sad to see this country.
[02:15:50.666 --> 02:15:51.667]  Circling the toilet bowl.
[02:15:52.287 --> 02:15:54.529]  And God love Trump, but he needs to declare the emergency.
[02:15:54.569 --> 02:15:55.229]  Great point, sir.
[02:15:55.249 --> 02:15:55.570]  Thank you.
[02:15:55.770 --> 02:15:56.490]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:57.571]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:57.871 --> 02:15:58.752]  Newswars.com.
[02:15:58.872 --> 02:16:00.233]  I need your help spreading those links.
[02:16:02.274 --> 02:16:03.195]  We trust the power.
[02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:13.102]  We've spent two years
[02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:24.347]  And had to pay top formulators and scientists from the top labs in the country to make what they believed was the best energy drink replacement.
[02:16:24.367 --> 02:16:26.089]  Because energy drinks are bad, on average.
[02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:34.314]  So we had the top formulator and the top natural health guru that advises the Olympic Committee, the NFL, you name it.
[02:16:34.374 --> 02:16:35.675]  That'd pay him a lot of money, too.
[02:16:35.775 --> 02:16:37.296]  And we had other groups go double-check it.
[02:16:37.316 --> 02:16:44.701]  Because I said, if the average energy drink has 30 cents of product that's actually energy and a bunch of sugar and crap and no minerals or vitamins,
[02:16:44.821 --> 02:16:50.712]  I said, what would happen if we sold something for $50 and it had $20 of product in it?
[02:16:51.453 --> 02:16:53.216]  And they said, that's not even done.
[02:16:53.277 --> 02:16:54.058]  That's impossible.
[02:16:55.226 --> 02:16:56.727]  It's just not, it's not done.
[02:16:57.047 --> 02:16:58.868]  So you have to understand how my brain works.
[02:16:58.908 --> 02:17:01.389]  How, how, how, how I operate.
[02:17:01.649 --> 02:17:09.212]  I said, I want the strongest, most powerful, cleanest, healthiest system with all of the key upload enzymes in it.
[02:17:09.313 --> 02:17:22.899]  Because the body, it doesn't matter how much energy drink you drink after a while, it depletes vitamins and minerals and cofactors and key chemicals that are needed to actually get it through the blood, through the blood-brain barrier, and to the cells in a healthy way without the crash.
[02:17:23.519 --> 02:17:26.462]  So imagine if there was an energy drink without the crash.
[02:17:26.842 --> 02:17:31.026]  Imagine if there was an energy drink without the toxicity and the sugar and all the garbage.
[02:17:31.467 --> 02:17:38.413]  Imagine if there was an energy drink that actually had everything that was really a vitamin and mineral fusion with everything else.
[02:17:38.453 --> 02:17:39.734]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:39.874 --> 02:17:42.497]  And I'll tell you right now that it is next level.
[02:17:42.697 --> 02:17:43.298]  TurboForce.
[02:17:43.578 --> 02:17:49.343]  Energy, metabolism, alertness, and if you look at the back of the box, it goes into everything it's got, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:49.483 --> 02:17:59.672]  And it's got the herbal energy blend that are all these different types of naturally occurring systems within chemicals that are naturally occurring in the plants to help upload it naturally.
[02:17:59.832 --> 02:18:00.393]  And it's all there.
[02:18:00.553 --> 02:18:06.338]  This is someone going to a bunch of top research, we went to four different groups, and saying, give us your plan of the
[02:18:06.738 --> 02:18:10.761]  Next level muscle car in natural, healthy energy.
[02:18:10.861 --> 02:18:15.185]  And again, Brain Force Plus is mainly a nootropic with a little bit of clean energy.
[02:18:15.245 --> 02:18:15.866]  People love it.
[02:18:16.006 --> 02:18:20.429]  This is ultimate pre-workout, but ultimate start your day or take it in the middle of the day.
[02:18:20.609 --> 02:18:23.572]  I, quite frankly, Brain Force works so good on me, I can barely take it.
[02:18:23.592 --> 02:18:26.574]  But I need to stay up all night because it goes to and pop one at 10 o'clock at night.
[02:18:26.594 --> 02:18:27.295]  I'm good at midnight.
[02:18:27.355 --> 02:18:27.955]  I'm up all night.
[02:18:28.035 --> 02:18:29.817]  And then I go to sleep and don't crash from it the next day.
[02:18:29.957 --> 02:18:40.164]  So this compliments Brain Force Plus, but this is a packet form, and quite frankly, I said make it one of the strongest out there on the market, but make it clean and make it good.
[02:18:41.324 --> 02:18:52.271]  Most people, I would suggest you take a quarter packet the first time you take it, because when we got prototypes of this a few months ago, man, everyone was bouncing off the walls, and we can't even believe this is legal.
[02:18:52.431 --> 02:18:54.353]  Bouncing off the walls.
[02:18:54.593 --> 02:18:59.136]  Because it has a spectrum of every natural form of caffeine there is.
[02:18:59.616 --> 02:19:04.597]  First up that has a four-hour burn rate, a three-hour burn rate, a two-hour burn rate, a one-hour burn rate.
[02:19:04.717 --> 02:19:09.958]  It's got all of these different enzymes that upload it, so you get a way bigger response.
[02:19:10.159 --> 02:19:14.460]  I think this is good, and I'm proud of it, and you'll use it responsibly.
[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:21.121]  But I said, give us the most powerful, clean, healthy thing, but in this genre, and I cannot believe we even produced this.
[02:19:21.241 --> 02:19:23.042]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:19:23.262 --> 02:19:24.522]  Turbo Force, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:26.643]  I mean, I think you should put a half in your water first.
[02:19:26.843 --> 02:19:29.324]  Why don't you get up in the morning and try this instead of your coffee?
[02:19:29.484 --> 02:19:33.206]  It's hard to even get into why this is so good because there's so many ingredients.
[02:19:33.426 --> 02:19:35.507]  I mean, there's just a ton of ingredients in this baby.
[02:19:35.647 --> 02:19:36.448]  A ton of ingredients.
[02:19:36.488 --> 02:19:39.369]  This took two years to develop, and it's to the moon without a rocket.
[02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:42.591]  So, get your first run of Turbo Force 33% off at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:42.651 --> 02:19:44.772]  Turbo Force, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:44.892 --> 02:19:45.552]  No reviews yet.
[02:19:45.572 --> 02:19:45.552]  $39.95.
[02:19:45.612 --> 02:19:46.653]  Blows away everything on the planet.
[02:19:46.673 --> 02:19:47.633]  This is the ultimate.
[02:20:06.781 --> 02:20:09.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.844 --> 02:20:16.945]  Nathan Phillips.
[02:20:35.305 --> 02:20:37.565]  You know, I said this on Sunday.
[02:20:37.645 --> 02:20:38.446]  I said it on Monday.
[02:20:39.706 --> 02:20:41.106]  And by Tuesday, it was all confirmed.
[02:20:42.727 --> 02:20:45.007]  He is a real scumbag.
[02:20:46.027 --> 02:20:56.129]  A virtuous, signaling, human... piece of deceptive, snake-like garbage.
[02:20:56.149 --> 02:20:58.850]  It's really hard to find words.
[02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:04.131]  He goes back 10 years in mainstream news articles praising him, like he's a great guy.
[02:21:06.886 --> 02:21:07.886]  Slithering around.
[02:21:09.167 --> 02:21:16.289]  He goes on college campuses on Halloween, trying to find a frat party or sorority party where people are dressed up like Native Americans.
[02:21:17.089 --> 02:21:23.371]  He then starts fights with them and confronts them, but has never been successful getting his nose broken.
[02:21:25.352 --> 02:21:31.894]  He still takes legal action and shakes down the school, and then they ban dressing up like Native Americans, which people do at parties.
[02:21:31.914 --> 02:21:32.654]  They dress up like everything.
[02:21:33.444 --> 02:21:35.325]  Different themed parties, like everyone knows.
[02:21:35.805 --> 02:21:36.485]  Nerd parties.
[02:21:36.865 --> 02:21:38.025]  Cowboys and Indians parties.
[02:21:40.646 --> 02:21:41.366]  Cinco de Mayo.
[02:21:41.386 --> 02:21:46.268]  They're saying, oh, on Cinco de Mayo, if you're not Hispanic or Mexican, you can't throw a party.
[02:21:46.308 --> 02:21:46.968]  That's on the news.
[02:21:47.468 --> 02:21:48.168]  The hell I will!
[02:21:48.208 --> 02:21:49.708]  My daughter has that birthday!
[02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:54.970]  The point is, is that the average Mexican wants you to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
[02:21:57.198 --> 02:22:02.281]  The point is, is that this is making everything evil and everyone against each other.
[02:22:03.342 --> 02:22:09.366]  That same day, it turns out, when the Catholic Church in DC, with 20 people, during mass, beating his drum, trying to get his ass kicked.
[02:22:11.428 --> 02:22:12.569]  And that's all he does.
[02:22:12.869 --> 02:22:14.790]  He does it over and over again.
[02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:22.816]  And for repayment, he's in leftist movies, he does all this stuff, and the whole corporate media tried to cover up for him.
[02:22:23.877 --> 02:22:24.717]  They tried to stead
[02:22:25.842 --> 02:22:31.426]  Fastly, cover up for him, and now they're still not saying what really happened.
[02:22:32.127 --> 02:22:40.613]  They're still not getting into the fact that they came up and said we're going to harvest your organs, we're going to kill you, we're going to do all this.
[02:22:40.633 --> 02:22:45.536]  Now here's the deal, I don't want violence, and the fact that they stood down really blew up in the face of the
[02:22:47.085 --> 02:22:50.349]  Leftist Gestapo that tries to provocateur this crap all the time.
[02:22:50.369 --> 02:22:53.652]  They've done it to me, then they edit the video out, make it look like I did something.
[02:22:53.672 --> 02:22:54.874]  The very same groups have done it.
[02:22:55.374 --> 02:22:56.696]  A group of Native Americans in D.C.
[02:22:57.056 --> 02:23:01.041]  with the same production company that broke this.
[02:23:01.081 --> 02:23:02.362]  So they know what they're doing.
[02:23:02.402 --> 02:23:02.923]  It's premeditated.
[02:23:04.738 --> 02:23:05.799]  But where are the adults?
[02:23:05.859 --> 02:23:23.368]  They ran and hid, and then the local Catholic Archdiocese said they were bad, and conservative TV said they were bad, even though that day it happened, we looked it up and said, let's find the raw footage from the person's channel, and they were there saying, let's go get them, F you white people, and marched over to them and got in their face!
[02:23:23.648 --> 02:23:24.429]  They started it!
[02:23:24.729 --> 02:23:26.630]  And still, we're four or five days in,
[02:23:29.935 --> 02:23:31.856]  And no one will even point that out.
[02:23:31.896 --> 02:23:34.476]  So let's go to Andrew Tate for the balance of the hour.
[02:23:34.496 --> 02:23:35.337]  A little bit in the next hour.
[02:23:35.357 --> 02:23:36.517]  I appreciate him coming on.
[02:23:36.537 --> 02:23:42.259]  He's an American-British kickboxer from Chicago, Illinois, who competes in the cruiserweight and heavyweight divisions.
[02:23:42.579 --> 02:23:46.240]  He's three-time ISKA kickboxing world champion.
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:48.661]  And a bunch of other top champions.
[02:23:48.701 --> 02:23:50.541]  He's a TV presenter, very successful guy.
[02:23:50.882 --> 02:23:51.862]  Good friends with Paul Watson.
[02:23:52.042 --> 02:23:53.723]  I just like what he talks about, what he does.
[02:23:54.263 --> 02:23:59.445]  He's been demonized for defending masculinity and, you know, saying when a guy's allowed to ask a girl out, that's not called rape.
[02:23:59.725 --> 02:24:01.145]  We'll get into the Gillette razor ad.
[02:24:01.185 --> 02:24:02.006]  He wants to cover that, too.
[02:24:02.046 --> 02:24:05.607]  But I figured Andrew would want to talk about these kids and what happened.
[02:24:06.187 --> 02:24:08.048]  And I'm very proud of them for standing down.
[02:24:08.128 --> 02:24:11.269]  But they were definitely trying to trick him into fighting him.
[02:24:11.589 --> 02:24:12.610]  And then what would have happened?
[02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:13.490]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:24:13.770 --> 02:24:15.431]  So thanks for joining us, Andrew.
[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:17.191]  Thank you, man.
[02:24:17.291 --> 02:24:19.153]  I'm very happy to be here, as always, Alex.
[02:24:19.193 --> 02:24:22.757]  You know I love coming on the show and speaking with you, so happy to be here.
[02:24:23.338 --> 02:24:24.900]  So what do you make of this situation?
[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:26.642]  Because I don't think it's played out yet.
[02:24:26.882 --> 02:24:28.544]  The media's still covering up what really happened.
[02:24:28.584 --> 02:24:36.233]  A grown gang of men tried to assault a high school and middle school group, and the whole country turned on the children because they were white.
[02:24:37.290 --> 02:24:38.010]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:38.250 --> 02:24:39.791]  It's absolutely a racist attack.
[02:24:40.211 --> 02:24:51.494]  And chief attention seeker, which is what I like to call him, because that's the only thing he's doing, traveling around with a drum, like you said, trying to find fights and trying to get attention any way he can by simply trying to cause trouble.
[02:24:51.934 --> 02:24:52.814]  That's all he's doing.
[02:24:53.234 --> 02:24:54.574]  And nobody takes him up on it.
[02:24:54.874 --> 02:25:00.636]  And when he sees a group of young, white, Christian, MAGA hat-wearing individuals, to him it's a jackpot.
[02:25:00.676 --> 02:25:01.276]  It's a payday.
[02:25:01.616 --> 02:25:02.797]  This is exactly what I need.
[02:25:03.097 --> 02:25:06.698]  No matter what happens in this exchange, I'm going to be the good guy.
[02:25:07.019 --> 02:25:08.119]  And that's been proven.
[02:25:08.159 --> 02:25:15.763]  He walks up to them, stands in the boy's face, sort of beating his drum, and the child just stands there and goes, OK, well, all right.
[02:25:15.843 --> 02:25:18.704]  And then nothing happens, and somehow these children have been vilified.
[02:25:19.124 --> 02:25:20.725]  It's insanity, and it's racist.
[02:25:21.065 --> 02:25:22.166]  It's openly racist.
[02:25:22.746 --> 02:25:23.666]  What's crazy is this.
[02:25:24.167 --> 02:25:29.149]  I may not completely look it, but if you can look my father up, Emory Tate, my father's black, my mother's white.
[02:25:29.209 --> 02:25:31.470]  So people always try and play the race card on me.
[02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:32.710]  I'm 50-50.
[02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:35.771]  So I live a very fair, balanced exchange.
[02:25:36.011 --> 02:25:39.933]  If I can simply see that there's racism against white Christians in America today.
[02:25:41.594 --> 02:25:44.055]  If I can see it, why can't everyone else see it?
[02:25:44.215 --> 02:25:52.260]  I know as a person of color, I'm half black, that we do not experience half the racism that a traditional white Christian American does.
[02:25:52.861 --> 02:25:54.022]  Under any circumstance.
[02:25:54.462 --> 02:25:54.742]  Never.
[02:25:55.042 --> 02:25:56.303]  So it's just absolutely insane.
[02:25:56.323 --> 02:25:59.785]  Let me guess though, but I would imagine you've had some on both sides.
[02:26:00.065 --> 02:26:05.929]  So describe when somebody figures out you're part African how they act if they are racist, versus when they think you're just pure white how they act.
[02:26:07.633 --> 02:26:16.136]  I genuinely, and I can say this from the bottom of my heart, I genuinely have never experienced true racism because I'm not white.
[02:26:16.196 --> 02:26:22.139]  You may have the odd psycho somewhere, but in general, if you show people respect, they show you back.
[02:26:22.639 --> 02:26:23.039]  However,
[02:26:23.985 --> 02:26:31.932]  If you come across as a straight white male, which I do pass as very often, then there is overt racism in your face.
[02:26:32.292 --> 02:26:33.934]  Blatantly, you're called a terrorist.
[02:26:33.954 --> 02:26:35.535]  You're blamed for all the world's problems.
[02:26:35.835 --> 02:26:37.957]  You're the worst man in the world overtly.
[02:26:38.257 --> 02:26:45.664]  The racism that white people suffer is, you can't even compare it to the racism the average black person suffers in the Western world today.
[02:26:45.964 --> 02:26:48.246]  The white people suffer racism 100,000 times higher.
[02:26:49.927 --> 02:26:57.094]  And I'm telling you as someone who's suffered from both, I've never really had anyone come up to me and say, you're a person of color, if you show me respect, I'm still gonna treat you badly.
[02:26:57.414 --> 02:27:04.540]  But I have had people say, you're a straight white man, you don't know anything about the world, you don't deserve an opinion, you shouldn't be here.
[02:27:04.841 --> 02:27:06.302]  I've had that multiple times.
[02:27:06.542 --> 02:27:08.884]  Oh and let me guess, a lot of times it's white people.
[02:27:08.905 --> 02:27:18.935]  Because we go out on the street, we have videos every day of like weird women running up to a white person and they go, you have white privilege, shut the hell up you white cracker piece of crap.
[02:27:19.515 --> 02:27:20.837]  And they're like, but you're white.
[02:27:20.857 --> 02:27:25.722]  It's like Abe Skrillex famously says, shut up, you're an effing white male, you have no right to speech.
[02:27:25.862 --> 02:27:27.243]  It's total mental illness.
[02:27:28.174 --> 02:27:28.855]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:27:28.875 --> 02:27:34.018]  And when I've made a point of view and they've come at me and said racist, I said, well, I'm not racist because I'm half black and half white.
[02:27:34.379 --> 02:27:35.920]  They say, oh, but you're white passing.
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:38.442]  You look white, so you don't understand anything.
[02:27:38.522 --> 02:27:39.142]  You're racist.
[02:27:39.643 --> 02:27:42.525]  And I'm like, how is it racist to build a wall to protect your own country?
[02:27:43.107 --> 02:27:44.347]  Are the Thais racist?
[02:27:44.427 --> 02:27:45.188]  They have borders.
[02:27:45.888 --> 02:27:47.888]  You can name so many countries in the world.
[02:27:48.148 --> 02:27:49.909]  Every country in the world has border security.
[02:27:50.229 --> 02:27:54.990]  And now you're a racist for wanting a wall when my father is black and half of my family is black?
[02:27:55.250 --> 02:28:03.852]  These people are so deranged, so deranged on every level, that the only reply they have, even to a person of color like me, is,
[02:28:04.452 --> 02:28:05.173]  You're a racist!
[02:28:05.394 --> 02:28:06.175]  It's insanity!
[02:28:06.315 --> 02:28:14.907]  It's insanity on every level, and I can tell you, and I'll say it again and again and again, the only people suffering obvious racism in the Western world today are straight white people.
[02:28:14.927 --> 02:28:20.836]  They're the people who are suffering the most injustice and the most marginalization above any other group.
[02:28:21.136 --> 02:28:27.739]  And yes, even the UN has to admit more than half of all worldwide persecution and murder is of Christians.
[02:28:28.179 --> 02:28:30.600]  And persecution of Christians has doubled the last decade.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.682]  So Christians are being targeted everywhere.
[02:28:33.702 --> 02:28:38.704]  And if you happen to be white Christian, then you are the most evil creature the planet has ever seen.
[02:28:38.964 --> 02:28:40.845]  And it's corporate America globally
[02:28:41.605 --> 02:28:42.126]  Funding that.
[02:28:42.166 --> 02:28:45.249]  When we come back, I want to ask Mr. Tate why he thinks that's happening.
[02:28:45.329 --> 02:28:47.231]  Andrew Tate, YouTube Tate Speech.
[02:28:47.691 --> 02:28:48.832]  On Twitter, Tate Speech.
[02:28:48.933 --> 02:28:50.194]  Instagram, Cobra Tate.
[02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:55.179]  So we'll be right back on the other side to get more into this and what he thinks is coming next.
[02:28:55.339 --> 02:28:59.483]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:28:59.803 --> 02:29:00.985]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:29:03.033 --> 02:29:12.055]  Imagine if Infowars hadn't been here to expose the global government, to expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[02:29:13.156 --> 02:29:20.898]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years, and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[02:29:22.478 --> 02:29:26.079]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[02:29:26.839 --> 02:29:29.440]  And that's not some platitude, that's not some pat on the back.
[02:29:30.683 --> 02:29:36.547]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[02:29:38.268 --> 02:29:38.828]  I'm the sea.
[02:29:38.988 --> 02:29:39.568]  You're the sea.
[02:29:39.588 --> 02:29:40.689]  I'm the wind.
[02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:42.950]  You're the wind.
[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:45.412]  We are all the sails together in this.
[02:29:45.492 --> 02:29:53.276]  But if you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[02:29:53.877 --> 02:29:55.638]  If you hadn't been faithful,
[02:29:57.256 --> 02:30:07.682]  In our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world, and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[02:30:09.403 --> 02:30:10.644]  But because of you, we've done that.
[02:30:11.544 --> 02:30:12.285]  There's an equation.
[02:30:13.345 --> 02:30:18.448]  If you spread the word about InfoWars, and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[02:30:19.169 --> 02:30:21.030]  And if you fund
[02:30:22.281 --> 02:30:25.183]  The information we're producing, it all comes together.
[02:30:25.823 --> 02:30:27.764]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[02:30:28.765 --> 02:30:39.391]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep InfoWars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits and the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[02:30:40.232 --> 02:30:47.356]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[02:30:48.657 --> 02:30:51.779]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[02:30:53.254 --> 02:30:59.098]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[02:30:59.639 --> 02:31:05.923]  They don't want us here where they try to assassinate nationalists and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries, the radical Islamists.
[02:31:06.283 --> 02:31:07.124]  They want us off the air.
[02:31:09.145 --> 02:31:12.248]  And that's why I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[02:31:12.628 --> 02:31:16.451]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[02:31:17.291 --> 02:31:20.754]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[02:31:21.914 --> 02:31:24.656]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[02:31:25.236 --> 02:31:26.817]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[02:31:27.818 --> 02:31:29.219]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[02:31:32.682 --> 02:31:36.884]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[02:31:37.704 --> 02:31:39.285]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[02:31:39.525 --> 02:31:42.646]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[02:31:42.806 --> 02:31:44.507]  I have dominated globalists.
[02:31:44.607 --> 02:31:46.028]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[02:31:46.548 --> 02:31:51.110]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[02:31:51.610 --> 02:31:54.231]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:59.014]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[02:31:59.214 --> 02:31:59.594]  I say,
[02:32:01.087 --> 02:32:06.889]  Get products of the best out there, win-win situation, fund us, and we're going to stop altogether.
[02:32:07.449 --> 02:32:10.771]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[02:32:11.791 --> 02:32:19.254]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when this sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[02:32:19.774 --> 02:32:24.216]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[02:32:24.956 --> 02:32:26.057]  So that's why it's the last run.
[02:32:27.093 --> 02:32:29.457]  It's available 50% off even though it's our last run.
[02:32:29.918 --> 02:32:32.341]  Inforstore.com because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[02:32:33.254 --> 02:32:37.316]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars, spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos.
[02:32:37.616 --> 02:32:40.578]  Because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[02:32:41.078 --> 02:32:43.659]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[02:32:44.039 --> 02:32:52.663]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[02:32:53.404 --> 02:32:58.386]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you.
[02:32:58.406 --> 02:33:00.887]  But more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[02:33:01.448 --> 02:33:01.848]  So thank you.
[02:33:06.313 --> 02:33:10.818]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.041 --> 02:33:18.586]  And now, I give you Age Skrillex, the prototype of the new leftist man.
[02:33:18.606 --> 02:33:22.750]  You've never experienced oppression in your entire f***ing life!
[02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:23.731]  Neither have I!
[02:33:23.872 --> 02:33:25.934]  You're a f***ing white male!
[02:33:55.552 --> 02:33:56.973]  Are you okay?
[02:33:57.133 --> 02:34:03.216]  Now, explain to me how Trump is a killer.
[02:34:03.336 --> 02:34:08.839]  Mass deportation is what these guys... Why me?
[02:34:08.959 --> 02:34:13.441]  Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why me?
[02:34:14.062 --> 02:34:20.065]  And now, you are surrounded by terrorists.
[02:34:33.726 --> 02:34:35.327]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:35.347 --> 02:34:37.348]  A lot of craziness here.
[02:34:37.368 --> 02:34:41.269]  We have a computer back there that never breaks down, but I guess trying to play the next video is just too much.
[02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:44.631]  H. Grealish broke the computer in there and almost shut things down.
[02:34:44.851 --> 02:34:47.152]  But we'll have that here for you in a moment.
[02:34:47.692 --> 02:34:58.536]  Going back to Andrew Tate, we can make jokes about this, because there's a lot of other video in that compilation before the computer froze, of women coming up and saying, you're an effing white male, you have no right to be here, you're an effing white person, get out of here.
[02:34:58.556 --> 02:34:59.417]  And they're mainly white.
[02:35:00.197 --> 02:35:02.378]  And so driving this, what do you think is behind this?
[02:35:02.398 --> 02:35:07.120]  Because the hysteria has now reached cuckoo-for-cocoa-puffs level.
[02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:12.042]  I know not just here, but in Europe, where they say if you don't let Muslims, they're letting Muslims rape women.
[02:35:12.362 --> 02:35:14.003]  Courts are ruling that they're allowed to.
[02:35:14.403 --> 02:35:20.806]  They've got TV shows, after-school programs targeting 12-year-old girls saying have sex with adult Muslim men.
[02:35:21.706 --> 02:35:23.907]  This is like a mass cucking exercise, or what is it?
[02:35:25.219 --> 02:35:38.228]  Well, the first thing that I like to point out to people is that the safest societies, well, we say safest, it's quickly changing, but still currently, the safest societies in the world are built by white Christian men.
[02:35:38.328 --> 02:35:50.437]  Like, we talk about how bad and evil a straight white Christian male can be when they've built the safest, most prosperous societies on the planet that everyone from every other nation seems to want to get into.
[02:35:51.147 --> 02:35:52.188]  So that's the first question.
[02:35:52.669 --> 02:35:58.955]  Why are you so desperate to come to a Christian country that was built by white Christian men if they're so evil?
[02:35:59.255 --> 02:36:06.483]  How did they manage to build these fantastic countries that you obviously see as a haven if there's such terrible, evil people?
[02:36:06.683 --> 02:36:08.085]  That's the first thing I don't understand.
[02:36:08.565 --> 02:36:12.029]  Surely, if we're so bad, then you want to live somewhere else.
[02:36:12.609 --> 02:36:13.350]  But that's not the case.
[02:36:13.370 --> 02:36:14.071]  They want to come here.
[02:36:14.391 --> 02:36:27.647]  And the reason there's a war against this, the reason there's a war against the idea of being white, and the reason you see white people coming up to you and screaming this, is because before they can brainwash someone completely, what you do is you debase them and you make them self-hate.
[02:36:28.087 --> 02:36:30.428]  You empty them out of their entire identities.
[02:36:30.448 --> 02:36:31.929]  You can fulfill them with something else.
[02:36:32.270 --> 02:36:34.811]  So you convince them that everything about themselves is bad.
[02:36:35.091 --> 02:36:36.472]  Everything about their history is bad.
[02:36:36.712 --> 02:36:39.114]  Because of their skin color, everything they've ever done is bad.
[02:36:39.514 --> 02:36:41.975]  And that they need a completely new worldview.
[02:36:42.235 --> 02:36:44.617]  And when you open them up, they're completely programmable.
[02:36:44.657 --> 02:36:46.738]  They're programmable to disbelieve anything you say.
[02:36:47.118 --> 02:36:48.519]  Which is insane on every level.
[02:36:48.779 --> 02:36:53.202]  Any white person who runs around screaming, white people are bad, has a mental condition.
[02:36:53.722 --> 02:36:54.523]  That's the reality.
[02:36:55.063 --> 02:36:56.744]  But this is what happens when they're programmed.
[02:36:56.764 --> 02:37:01.446]  They're completely and utterly, their brains are scooped out, ready to be filled with globalist propaganda.
[02:37:01.866 --> 02:37:14.693]  Regardless of the fact of history, regardless of the fact that straight white men in Christian countries are the best countries in the world, the safest countries in the world, regardless of how much fantastic work we've done, they just want to scoop everyone's brain out and pretend that we're evil because slavery happened.
[02:37:15.073 --> 02:37:15.994]  I'll tell you something as a person.
[02:37:16.014 --> 02:37:17.154]  Like I said, my father's black.
[02:37:17.174 --> 02:37:18.295]  I'll tell you a lot about slavery.
[02:37:18.935 --> 02:37:21.316]  The world hasn't always been a nice place.
[02:37:21.836 --> 02:37:25.177]  At the time there were slaves in America, there were slaves in China.
[02:37:25.577 --> 02:37:26.457]  Other Chinese people.
[02:37:26.497 --> 02:37:27.817]  There were slaves in the Middle East.
[02:37:28.057 --> 02:37:29.298]  There were slaves in Africa.
[02:37:29.498 --> 02:37:30.958]  There were slaves everywhere.
[02:37:31.198 --> 02:37:32.419]  That's the human condition.
[02:37:32.659 --> 02:37:34.519]  People were not as civilized as they now are.
[02:37:34.759 --> 02:37:35.619]  There were slaves.
[02:37:35.819 --> 02:37:37.020]  The world's not fantastic.
[02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:38.020]  That's the reality.
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:46.205]  And it was the Christian West that began 400 years ago trying to stop it, and then England fought 50 years of war and actually went to war.
[02:37:46.245 --> 02:37:46.766]  That was part of the 1776.
[02:37:46.986 --> 02:37:53.070]  That's why Jefferson first wrote a constitution that ended it, thinking maybe they'll stop, but we had the Civil War over it.
[02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:54.191]  I mean, there were wars.
[02:37:54.271 --> 02:37:57.032]  Britain attacked more than 20 countries trying to end slavery.
[02:37:57.253 --> 02:37:59.234]  The West is what started the ending of it.
[02:38:00.237 --> 02:38:00.898]  Absolutely!
[02:38:01.178 --> 02:38:06.081]  So, although it existed everywhere in the world, people are going to talk about slavery in America like it's the only place it ever happened.
[02:38:06.101 --> 02:38:14.908]  It happened absolutely everywhere, and it was the white Christian men who went to go and die to end it, to protect the minorities, because they decided that it wasn't ethical.
[02:38:15.228 --> 02:38:24.475]  And now you're going to sit here and say it's white Christian men that are bad, they've done everything bad in the world after they've built the most successful countries ever, and try and vilify every single white Christian man because of their skin color.
[02:38:24.735 --> 02:38:27.997]  It's absolutely racist, and it's clinically insane.
[02:38:28.017 --> 02:38:28.698]  Yeah, so why...
[02:38:29.278 --> 02:38:30.979]  Why are the social engineers doing it?
[02:38:31.019 --> 02:38:36.941]  I want your take on this, but they admit they don't want the ethos of treating people good there.
[02:38:37.261 --> 02:38:39.722]  They want it overwritten so they can enslave everybody.
[02:38:40.062 --> 02:38:45.704]  That's what the corporate globalists want, the Chinese communist model where everybody's a slave but the tiny one-tenth of one percent.
[02:38:46.949 --> 02:38:54.853]  If you look at what everything the globalists are trying to do from my point of view, what I see it all leading to is ultimate selfishness.
[02:38:55.193 --> 02:38:58.174]  They want everyone depressed because then you can't think outside of your mind.
[02:38:58.474 --> 02:39:05.218]  They want everyone, they don't want you to be patriotic, they don't want you to care about community, all they want you to do is be obsessed and care about yourself.
[02:39:05.298 --> 02:39:12.081]  And they don't want you to be masculine and charged up on a mission having any success ever because then you break away from them, exactly.
[02:39:13.081 --> 02:39:28.712]  Absolutely right and this is why all I can tell you why the people those liberal men were screaming so angrily in that video I can tell you why because they're frustrated that they have no girlfriend and they somehow think the world is terrible because they're white and white people are terrible and their brains are just
[02:39:28.712 --> 02:39:31.214]  Let's put this video back up for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[02:39:31.234 --> 02:39:32.696]  Imagine if you were going to be on Deserted Island
[02:39:53.456 --> 02:39:55.698]  Okay, and I defend for yourself, and there's going to be 20 of you.
[02:39:55.718 --> 02:39:57.039]  10 women, 10 men.
[02:39:57.419 --> 02:40:00.041]  Would you want to be with Age Skrillex and Carl the Cuck?
[02:40:00.201 --> 02:40:02.243]  Or would you rather be with Andrew Tate and Alex Jones?
[02:40:02.403 --> 02:40:03.504]  Or Owen Schroer?
[02:40:03.764 --> 02:40:05.305]  I mean, let's just get down to the bottom line here.
[02:40:05.526 --> 02:40:06.606]  Who would you rather, women?
[02:40:06.987 --> 02:40:07.827]  Of course, I know the answer.
[02:40:07.847 --> 02:40:08.648]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[02:40:08.728 --> 02:40:09.769]  I have no problem with women.
[02:40:10.149 --> 02:40:11.910]  The point is, everybody knows what we want.
[02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:12.810]  Everybody knows what we want.
[02:40:13.090 --> 02:40:25.195]  So yeah, Abe Skrillex and Carl Dukak, two of the famous, you know, patient zero of this stuff that we documented, now three years ago, they are projecting their own hatred of themselves, because they've been put into this failed university system, onto us.
[02:40:26.730 --> 02:40:27.311]  Absolutely!
[02:40:27.591 --> 02:40:33.317]  There is no way those individuals wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and think, I'm glad I'm me.
[02:40:33.877 --> 02:40:37.361]  And the proof for that is that they run around screaming that white people are bad.
[02:40:37.641 --> 02:40:40.905]  So they look at their own skin color and then run around saying, I hate white people.
[02:40:41.145 --> 02:40:42.727]  These people are clinically insane.
[02:40:43.027 --> 02:40:44.829]  And you know what's the most scary thing about this is?
[02:40:45.289 --> 02:40:53.391]  The liberals, when they start programming people this way, and they couple it with trying to tell men, like the Gillette ad, to not control their emotions.
[02:40:53.691 --> 02:40:54.791]  Don't control your emotions.
[02:40:55.051 --> 02:40:56.132]  Don't hold anything in.
[02:40:56.552 --> 02:40:58.072]  That's how violence happens.
[02:40:58.152 --> 02:41:06.354]  It's not from a stoic, strong, right-wing individual who understands that even if bad things happen, he needs to keep his cool and think it through.
[02:41:06.654 --> 02:41:08.395]  It's from emotional little babies.
[02:41:08.815 --> 02:41:10.395]  That's how these terrible things happen.
[02:41:10.435 --> 02:41:11.535]  These people are more dangerous.
[02:41:11.555 --> 02:41:13.816]  Every one of the mass shooters has been an erotic
[02:41:16.735 --> 02:41:19.236]  We call them incel, involuntarily celibate.
[02:41:19.456 --> 02:41:20.477]  They're always on Prozac.
[02:41:20.497 --> 02:41:24.659]  They're always obsessed with fantasy worlds and how they're going to have power once they do something evil.
[02:41:24.919 --> 02:41:27.480]  Whereas a successful person wants to take care of themselves and others.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:35.444]  We'll come back with a Gillette ad and play parts of it and start and stop it, but when you watch it, a good-looking woman's walking by dressed like she's ready to, you know, meet males.
[02:41:35.504 --> 02:41:44.469]  Doesn't mean she likes every male, but she's all dressed, showing off her goods, and a guy's going to go talk to her, and the virtue signaler stops the evil white guy.
[02:41:45.149 --> 02:41:47.071]  Because no, talking to a woman is rape.
[02:41:47.492 --> 02:41:49.734]  So now they're devolving it down to that.
[02:41:49.754 --> 02:41:57.983]  At some point in history, your grandfather and my grandfather decided to go and talk to our grandmothers.
[02:41:58.522 --> 02:41:59.903]  That is the reason we exist.
[02:42:00.463 --> 02:42:02.345]  There is no other way it would have possibly happened.
[02:42:02.685 --> 02:42:05.887]  Now we live in a society where a man can't even go and say hello.
[02:42:06.108 --> 02:42:07.308]  I'm not saying he should pursue her.
[02:42:07.509 --> 02:42:09.210]  If she says go away, of course he should go away.
[02:42:09.430 --> 02:42:10.691]  He could go introduce himself.
[02:42:10.931 --> 02:42:12.272]  That's how I met my fiancée.
[02:42:12.292 --> 02:42:13.553]  I'm sure it's how you met your wife.
[02:42:13.793 --> 02:42:19.657]  It's how everyone who's watching this exists because someone in history at some point said hello to the other one.
[02:42:19.858 --> 02:42:23.560]  And now we live in a society where that's deemed as destructive and dangerous.
[02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:24.461]  Let's pull back from that.
[02:42:24.521 --> 02:42:26.843]  I was in a sushi place when I met my current wife.
[02:42:27.443 --> 02:42:28.164]  And she was a liberal.
[02:42:28.304 --> 02:42:30.185]  They were one of her friends, but a nicer liberal.
[02:42:30.445 --> 02:42:32.347]  And she made a joke like, oh, you're the right-wing blah blah blah.
[02:42:32.367 --> 02:42:33.368]  And I said, yeah, that's right.
[02:42:33.668 --> 02:42:35.089]  Sweetheart, come sit on my lap right here.
[02:42:35.129 --> 02:42:35.970]  Good-looking blonde, you know?
[02:42:36.470 --> 02:42:37.791]  And, you know, we talked about an hour.
[02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:38.292]  She did it.
[02:42:38.332 --> 02:42:39.452]  And then that was the rest of history.
[02:42:39.913 --> 02:42:40.833]  She came and talked to me.
[02:42:40.934 --> 02:42:42.134]  We did that little bit of banner.
[02:42:42.495 --> 02:42:44.136]  You know, back in, I could tell, oh, she really wants me.
[02:42:44.216 --> 02:42:45.557]  She's talking crap.
[02:42:45.937 --> 02:42:47.619]  This girl wants to get my attention.
[02:42:48.019 --> 02:42:48.860]  And she did get my attention.
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:50.161]  Now we have a baby together, and she's awesome.
[02:42:50.541 --> 02:42:52.543]  But did she, was it abusive that she came over to me?
[02:42:53.223 --> 02:42:55.286]  No, that's what the females come right, sit right here.
[02:42:55.306 --> 02:42:56.728]  That's what needs to happen.
[02:42:56.748 --> 02:42:57.510]  Sit right on my knee.
[02:42:57.530 --> 02:42:58.471]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:58.491 --> 02:42:58.892]  Stay with us.
[02:43:05.782 --> 02:43:08.483]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:43:08.823 --> 02:43:14.726]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:43:15.266 --> 02:43:27.232]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:43:30.733 --> 02:43:34.475]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:39.061]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply.
[02:43:39.462 --> 02:43:42.383]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:43:44.344 --> 02:43:46.945]  Perfect for work in the car or at home.
[02:43:47.506 --> 02:43:50.287]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:43:50.747 --> 02:43:52.128]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:44:05.745 --> 02:44:13.629]  You've got Alexandra Cortez coming out saying CBS is racist and bad because they didn't send a black reporter to cover her for Congress.
[02:44:13.929 --> 02:44:15.810]  She says, better get better next time.
[02:44:15.890 --> 02:44:19.793]  That's why to counter her, to get back in her face whenever she said that Don Jr.
[02:44:19.873 --> 02:44:23.715]  might face prison time for making the point that, you know, she loves Venezuela so much.
[02:44:23.835 --> 02:44:25.215]  In Venezuela, they eat their dogs.
[02:44:25.356 --> 02:44:27.957]  In capitalist countries like America, we walk our dogs.
[02:44:28.237 --> 02:44:33.321]  So, I came up with the idea for this little baby, and we have this as a limited edition, but I want it to be a bestseller.
[02:44:33.441 --> 02:44:34.642]  This is the first limited edition.
[02:44:34.662 --> 02:44:35.803]  We have another design coming out.
[02:44:36.083 --> 02:44:38.966]  There's only a few thousand of these, but we want this to be a huge seller.
[02:44:39.226 --> 02:44:43.109]  We want to put 50,000, 100,000 out of these like we've done Hillary for President.
[02:44:43.749 --> 02:44:47.572]  And it says, Capitalists walk their dogs, Socialists eat them.
[02:44:48.353 --> 02:44:52.696]  Then it's got an American flag that's very triggering to her, saying InfoWars.com.
[02:44:53.337 --> 02:44:54.057]  So there it is.
[02:44:55.218 --> 02:44:57.479]  It is on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:58.100 --> 02:45:00.701]  There's links to it on InfoWars.com.
[02:45:01.121 --> 02:45:02.222]  It's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:02.302 --> 02:45:05.083]  Capitalist Walk Their Dog, Socialist Eat Them shirt.
[02:45:05.163 --> 02:45:15.669]  This is triggering, this is powerful, and it shows her with an enlarged cartoon head with giant ears looking like a dog foaming at the mouth because that's what she looks like is a dog on methamphetamine.
[02:45:15.809 --> 02:45:17.270]  She's probably on methamphetamine.
[02:45:17.290 --> 02:45:18.070]  I mean, what is she on?
[02:45:18.090 --> 02:45:18.871]  We should ask the question.
[02:45:18.931 --> 02:45:19.711]  She used to be good-looking.
[02:45:19.731 --> 02:45:21.632]  She's lost so much weight and has meth mouth.
[02:45:21.792 --> 02:45:24.273]  So you could call it the Alexandra Cortez meth mouth.
[02:45:24.434 --> 02:45:31.898]  Because she dares to threaten people with jail time and subpoenas if they make fun of the fact that capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:45:32.038 --> 02:45:35.120]  And she looks meth, you know, out of her brain now.
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:37.501]  Like she's flying on planet Pop-Tart.
[02:45:37.581 --> 02:45:39.843]  And so, get the hottest shirt on the internet.
[02:45:39.863 --> 02:45:40.643]  We know it's gonna be the hottest.
[02:45:40.743 --> 02:45:43.545]  No reviews yet because we're just launching it in the last few days.
[02:45:43.705 --> 02:45:46.607]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLives.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:48.848 --> 02:45:49.808]  Listen, we need your support.
[02:45:49.848 --> 02:45:51.749]  We want these to blow off the shelf.
[02:45:51.889 --> 02:45:52.849]  I want to reorder them.
[02:45:52.949 --> 02:45:55.250]  We're going to have a slightly different design each time.
[02:45:55.350 --> 02:46:00.032]  I want to have 10 different limited editions shell out in the next six months of this.
[02:46:00.132 --> 02:46:04.114]  And I want this everywhere, because she's the new symbol of the Democratic Party.
[02:46:04.694 --> 02:46:08.155]  And it points out, capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:46:08.475 --> 02:46:11.476]  And when people say, man, well, why are you showing her as a dog?
[02:46:11.716 --> 02:46:13.437]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, in the final
[02:46:13.717 --> 02:46:17.199]  In the equation of communism, people eat people and are made lower than dogs.
[02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:21.603]  And she is an absolute tyrant wanting to arrest people that make fun of her.
[02:46:21.743 --> 02:46:25.485]  And so we're going to show her how America works and throw it back in her face.
[02:46:25.565 --> 02:46:29.048]  Because her dancing a few years ago, she was good looking and looked healthy.
[02:46:29.568 --> 02:46:30.669]  What drugs are she on?
[02:46:30.689 --> 02:46:31.670]  We need an intervention.
[02:46:32.050 --> 02:46:33.251]  Methamphetamine?
[02:46:33.311 --> 02:46:35.072]  Or is it Adderall?
[02:46:35.332 --> 02:46:36.253]  What is she snorting?
[02:46:36.613 --> 02:46:38.374]  We need to help Alexandra Cortez.
[02:46:38.554 --> 02:46:39.235]  Get the t-shirt.
[02:46:39.415 --> 02:46:40.356]  InfoWarsore.com.
[02:46:40.456 --> 02:46:40.716]  Do it!
[02:47:06.202 --> 02:47:08.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:35.339 --> 02:47:36.120]  No, but seriously.
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:38.641]  Feminists teach that all sex is rape.
[02:47:39.241 --> 02:47:40.502]  Talking to a woman is assault.
[02:47:40.962 --> 02:47:42.063]  Gillette ads say don't do it.
[02:47:42.083 --> 02:47:44.704]  We're going to play it here and get Andrew Tate's take on this.
[02:47:45.185 --> 02:47:46.325]  Very articulate, smart guy.
[02:47:46.345 --> 02:47:47.286]  Just common sense stuff.
[02:47:47.686 --> 02:47:48.707]  World champion kickboxer.
[02:47:50.796 --> 02:47:51.437]  But think about it.
[02:47:51.677 --> 02:47:55.760]  In my experience, I'm more like a gorilla or something with women.
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:48:00.704]  I just kind of sit back usually and, you know, not that I'm Mr. Pickup Artist or anything.
[02:48:00.724 --> 02:48:02.565]  I'm a married, happily father of four children.
[02:48:03.085 --> 02:48:07.068]  But in my experience, when women start teasing and messing with you, that's when they're really interested.
[02:48:07.088 --> 02:48:11.292]  You just tease them back and then make jokes about them and then it's done.
[02:48:12.165 --> 02:48:15.106]  In fact, women want to laugh and have fun, I found, more than anything else.
[02:48:15.166 --> 02:48:21.187]  But imagine my wife, she came over and hit on me.
[02:48:21.987 --> 02:48:22.967]  She was insulting me.
[02:48:23.047 --> 02:48:23.808]  She was aggressive.
[02:48:24.488 --> 02:48:25.328]  She was a liberal.
[02:48:25.428 --> 02:48:29.509]  But she was very excited and flush and obviously attracted to me.
[02:48:30.089 --> 02:48:32.009]  And so I knew what was going on and played along with it.
[02:48:32.689 --> 02:48:33.750]  And the rest is history.
[02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:37.310]  But imagine when everyone was such a chip on your shoulder, you can't even talk to somebody.
[02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:39.751]  We'll talk to Mr. Tate about that in a moment, but first,
[02:48:41.499 --> 02:48:46.782]  Folks, they're totally trying to shut us down, and if you don't buy a crap ton of products at Inforestore.com, we won't be here.
[02:48:47.602 --> 02:48:51.925]  I could fire up the bat signal and say we're not going to be able to expand if you don't buy a bunch of products.
[02:48:52.185 --> 02:48:53.245]  That's basically where we're at.
[02:48:53.766 --> 02:48:55.066]  I want to hire more reporters.
[02:48:55.947 --> 02:48:57.408]  We had four reporters in D.C.
[02:48:57.428 --> 02:48:58.148]  for the Women's March.
[02:48:58.748 --> 02:48:59.849]  Twenty-something million views.
[02:48:59.949 --> 02:49:00.850]  Don't make a dime off it.
[02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:02.491]  We're totally demonetized.
[02:49:02.811 --> 02:49:05.332]  Twenty million views so far, what our reporters shot and did.
[02:49:05.372 --> 02:49:06.513]  But we exposed evil, didn't we?
[02:49:07.033 --> 02:49:08.454]  And we exposed the whole thing with the
[02:49:10.871 --> 02:49:12.732]  Native American guys starting to fight and all the rest of it.
[02:49:13.173 --> 02:49:13.753]  It's critical.
[02:49:13.793 --> 02:49:15.214]  We have Will Johnson on the West Coast.
[02:49:15.234 --> 02:49:16.055]  We got a lot of the reporters.
[02:49:16.915 --> 02:49:20.637]  But we barely have money to fly people around for hotels and stuff.
[02:49:20.658 --> 02:49:21.738]  We need a lot of money.
[02:49:22.158 --> 02:49:23.659]  It takes a lot of money to fight Soros.
[02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.000]  All this, we make it easy.
[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:29.944]  I went out two years ago and I said, what's the number one selling thing in supplements?
[02:49:29.964 --> 02:49:31.685]  And they said pre-workout and energy drinks.
[02:49:32.805 --> 02:49:38.268]  But most of them are full of dyes and toxins and synthetic stimulants and synthetic caffeine.
[02:49:38.288 --> 02:49:39.969]  And I said, then get us the top researchers.
[02:49:40.690 --> 02:49:50.555]  And I want the strongest, cleanest, most powerful, not just pre-workout, you can call it that, overall energy, stamina, nootropic brain.
[02:49:51.115 --> 02:49:52.116]  It complements brain force.
[02:49:52.156 --> 02:49:53.056]  It's turbo force.
[02:49:54.377 --> 02:49:56.698]  I'm not going to spend 10 minutes going into all the amino acids.
[02:49:58.268 --> 02:50:02.251]  And all the different types of natural caffeine, all the other natural things.
[02:50:02.711 --> 02:50:04.592]  It's all designed to have a continued burn.
[02:50:04.952 --> 02:50:07.514]  The best stuff out there lasts four or five hours, folks.
[02:50:07.954 --> 02:50:09.915]  This will have you bouncing off the walls for 10 to 14 hours.
[02:50:09.935 --> 02:50:12.757]  Now, I'm telling you, without the hangover.
[02:50:13.778 --> 02:50:14.658]  Nothing is like it.
[02:50:14.718 --> 02:50:15.899]  That's because it costs a lot.
[02:50:16.359 --> 02:50:21.243]  Most companies might put 30 cents in a packet and sell the packet for five bucks.
[02:50:21.283 --> 02:50:21.383]  No.
[02:50:23.266 --> 02:50:27.829]  We put more in TurboForce than anyone else ever has in over-the-counter.
[02:50:28.529 --> 02:50:30.130]  No one has made anything like this.
[02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:34.792]  I want to warn you, I took half a packet this morning and I've been bouncing off the walls worse than normal.
[02:50:35.073 --> 02:50:37.814]  And I'm not even kidding, I'm telling you, TurboForce is it.
[02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:42.397]  And it's all the amino acids, vitamins, minerals, all these key uptakers, it's it.
[02:50:43.397 --> 02:50:44.397]  It's the Holy Grail.
[02:50:44.477 --> 02:50:45.258]  It's the unicorn.
[02:50:45.638 --> 02:50:47.338]  It's going to be the most dominant out there.
[02:50:47.678 --> 02:50:48.519]  If you simply try it.
[02:50:48.539 --> 02:50:53.921]  And then we'll have all the funding to crush Soros and crush Hillary and crush them all, because we'll never give up or back down.
[02:50:54.101 --> 02:50:57.802]  But money is the final equation and word of mouth in the face of this censorship.
[02:50:58.122 --> 02:50:58.822]  TurboForce!
[02:50:59.142 --> 02:50:59.422]  Get it.
[02:50:59.562 --> 02:51:00.463]  It'll blow you away today.
[02:51:00.703 --> 02:51:01.463]  And get the fish oil.
[02:51:01.683 --> 02:51:02.964]  We have the best fish oil.
[02:51:03.424 --> 02:51:06.505]  For half the price of the most expensive ones, they sell at medical labs.
[02:51:07.375 --> 02:51:10.736]  Okay, so, InfoWarsTore.com, 888-253-3139.
[02:51:10.956 --> 02:51:23.298]  And be sure to check out Andrew Tate and all the great work he's doing at Tate Speech on YouTube, Tate Speech on Twitter, Instagram, CobraTate, and Tate, S-H-I-N-K-A-I.net.
[02:51:23.558 --> 02:51:33.100]  Okay, I've been ranting, you've got the floor for this segment and the next, and then we've got another guest host taking over, Roger Stone, and then I've got to go meet with lawyers about lawsuits!
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:35.000]  I have to do it, I'm not a litigious person, but
[02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:38.621]  People are going to stop saying I'm sending people to Sandy Hook homes.
[02:51:39.161 --> 02:51:42.183]  They're going to stop saying I'm harassing families when I never did and aren't.
[02:51:42.203 --> 02:51:46.544]  Because I didn't do what all the left did, saying go to the house and kill these people and dox them.
[02:51:46.844 --> 02:51:48.085]  They're all getting sued now, too.
[02:51:48.605 --> 02:51:51.386]  The point is, this is going to stop, so I've got to go.
[02:51:51.426 --> 02:51:55.848]  But just other great points, the Gillette ad we can roll in the background.
[02:51:56.148 --> 02:51:58.529]  This is so vomitous, so divide and conquer.
[02:52:00.109 --> 02:52:00.870]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:52:00.970 --> 02:52:01.250]  I mean,
[02:52:02.162 --> 02:52:03.603]  To me, it's more than just that.
[02:52:04.084 --> 02:52:05.705]  To me, it's genuinely dangerous.
[02:52:07.187 --> 02:52:12.472]  Because what I think they're doing is they're provoking men to lose all self-control.
[02:52:12.892 --> 02:52:24.162]  The left have this really strange view that if they teach men to be ultra-feminine, that they're just going to become little puppies who will cry all day and nothing bad will ever happen in the world.
[02:52:24.202 --> 02:52:25.784]  And this is wrong for two reasons.
[02:52:26.424 --> 02:52:31.249]  One, when bad things do happen, which is inevitable, you do need big, strong men.
[02:52:31.529 --> 02:52:36.854]  It doesn't matter if you need a firefighter to run into a fiery building or a soldier to defend a country.
[02:52:37.134 --> 02:52:38.995]  You're going to need big, strong men sooner or later.
[02:52:39.516 --> 02:52:40.557]  And the second thing is this.
[02:52:41.057 --> 02:52:46.342]  You can look at humans from a societal standpoint and from a historical standpoint.
[02:52:46.682 --> 02:52:51.368]  But from a historical standpoint, all humans have always had the capacity for violence.
[02:52:51.428 --> 02:52:52.089]  We've needed it.
[02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:53.291]  We've had predators.
[02:52:53.311 --> 02:52:54.953]  We've had warring tribes.
[02:52:55.013 --> 02:52:55.934]  There was always a war.
[02:52:56.134 --> 02:52:59.078]  Men have always had the capacity for violence because it was necessary.
[02:52:59.688 --> 02:53:05.892]  And now they're telling men to have basically no self-control of their emotions and to give in completely to how they feel.
[02:53:05.912 --> 02:53:08.873]  And they think that that's going to turn us all into crime haters.
[02:53:08.893 --> 02:53:14.277]  The very reason no one ever can put women in combat, unless it's a totally overrun situation.
[02:53:15.157 --> 02:53:17.138]  Because women aren't willing, they're willing to kill.
[02:53:17.158 --> 02:53:19.780]  The problem is, then they do the war crimes, they really go crazy.
[02:53:20.530 --> 02:53:21.631]  Absolutely right.
[02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:25.072]  So, you know, you've been persecuted and I've been persecuted.
[02:53:25.432 --> 02:53:34.876]  But as men, sometimes when we feel angry, what we do is we suppress that and make sure we still act within the confines of the law and we control ourselves and we control our emotions.
[02:53:34.996 --> 02:53:39.518]  But we use the anger to put it into energy and attacking other ways.
[02:53:40.370 --> 02:53:42.412]  Exactly right, but we make sensible decisions.
[02:53:42.752 --> 02:53:46.836]  Whereas if you want to take a whole generation of men and say, give in to your feelings, absolutely.
[02:53:47.157 --> 02:53:48.838]  Give in to your feelings, it's fine.
[02:53:49.099 --> 02:53:49.859]  That's normal.
[02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:57.146]  And you think there's not going to be any kind of repercussion when they get angry, when they feel neglected by a female.
[02:53:57.387 --> 02:53:59.749]  You think these are the people who are not going to go fully crazy?
[02:54:00.209 --> 02:54:05.171]  The only people you can trust are men who can control themselves, not the men who have no self-control.
[02:54:05.352 --> 02:54:14.856]  Because yeah, there's going to be some times they cry, and there's going to be other times, like this dude, when I start threatening people with physical violence and losing their temper and flipping the switch off the top of a hat.
[02:54:14.956 --> 02:54:16.517]  And you know what's going to make this worse?
[02:54:16.937 --> 02:54:18.918]  You said earlier, Alex, about incels.
[02:54:19.458 --> 02:54:22.142]  No woman wants a man who acts that way.
[02:54:22.402 --> 02:54:29.952]  So everything's gonna get worse when the men who act that way can't get a girlfriend, they're lonely, they're depressed, they're upset, they have no emotional control.
[02:54:29.972 --> 02:54:37.221]  It creates a chain reaction, not giving women what they want, the men don't get what they want, the women don't get what they want, and total explosion.
[02:54:38.203 --> 02:54:43.706]  Absolutely, they're going to have lonely, depressed people with no self-control running around on Earth.
[02:54:44.086 --> 02:54:48.188]  And you think they're just going to cry about it all day before they eventually do something stupid.
[02:54:48.489 --> 02:54:49.989]  And that's where the violence comes from.
[02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:52.931]  It doesn't come from a big, strong, confident man.
[02:54:53.211 --> 02:54:54.031]  It doesn't come from that.
[02:54:54.051 --> 02:54:55.832]  It comes from an emotional wreck.
[02:54:56.233 --> 02:54:57.753]  Some guy with no self-control.
[02:54:58.074 --> 02:54:59.935]  And that's what this Gillette ad is advocating.
[02:55:00.255 --> 02:55:01.996]  It's going to create dangerous people.
[02:55:02.436 --> 02:55:04.337]  Men without self-control are dangerous.
[02:55:04.737 --> 02:55:05.837]  They are dangerous people.
[02:55:06.317 --> 02:55:09.098]  I want to find me a man who's stoic with self-control.
[02:55:09.358 --> 02:55:11.238]  He's a man you can trust in all situations.
[02:55:11.579 --> 02:55:16.620]  Not a man who just collapses to his emotions absolutely, regardless of how appropriate he is.
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:17.520]  No, no, that's a good point.
[02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:19.340]  That's a good point because it's a balance.
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:21.641]  You have guys that are cowards and collapse and do nothing.
[02:55:22.101 --> 02:55:26.002]  You have people that become like ninnies who freak out and go crazy.
[02:55:26.462 --> 02:55:30.403]  And then you need somebody who's actually stoic, focused, who can turn it on when they can.
[02:55:30.423 --> 02:55:32.023]  People say, oh, Alex Jones loses his temper.
[02:55:32.603 --> 02:55:34.405]  It's not an act, it's not a manipulation.
[02:55:34.425 --> 02:55:37.007]  I let it out to show people to wake up.
[02:55:37.127 --> 02:55:46.475]  I'm trying to trigger men to get conservative and Christian men who have been frozen out of being too controlled into letting loose some to wake up.
[02:55:46.895 --> 02:55:52.260]  But then you don't want to overthaw and put on a dress and run around and go into hysteria.
[02:55:53.186 --> 02:56:01.554]  Well, absolutely right, and there's nothing wrong with being passionate at all, but if you're going to give in, I'm telling you now, you teach a whole bunch of boys to cry every time they feel sad.
[02:56:01.814 --> 02:56:04.797]  You're also telling them to punch someone every time they feel angry.
[02:56:05.118 --> 02:56:09.382]  And they're going to be growing up with absolutely zero self-control, and these are the people who do the terrible things you see in America.
[02:56:09.402 --> 02:56:11.164]  You're telling them to give in to their emotions.
[02:56:11.926 --> 02:56:16.209]  Give in absolutely because that makes you a better person and if you hold anything in, you're not a real man.
[02:56:16.489 --> 02:56:20.953]  You feel upset, you just go run around with that machine gun because you feel sad.
[02:56:21.213 --> 02:56:26.557]  On top of that, we're going to give them a whole bunch of antidepressant drugs and mess with their brain chemistry and they're never going to be able to get a girlfriend.
[02:56:26.817 --> 02:56:30.320]  And we think these people are going to grow up and be functional members of society?
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.140]  Let's pull back, let's pull back.
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:45.083]  The lowest crime rate in the United States by an order of magnitude, you give a black person a concealed carry, a white person, a Hispanic, suddenly they all have the same number, almost no crime, and almost no false shootings.
[02:56:45.723 --> 02:56:46.063]  Okay?
[02:56:46.283 --> 02:56:48.683]  So they were so desperate to use Zimmerman because maybe it was questionable.
[02:56:49.103 --> 02:56:57.625]  So you have, you suddenly give some responsibility, they go through a class, they respect it, now they're like the guard dog, and suddenly they're the best citizen you ever saw.
[02:56:57.885 --> 02:56:58.725]  The police will tell you that.
[02:56:59.065 --> 02:57:06.892]  Now, that's because they go through a process, they get basically knighted that they're going to be a protector of society, suddenly they can be totally trusted.
[02:57:07.453 --> 02:57:18.363]  But they're saying the opposite here, where they're saying we have no right to defend ourselves, no right to be involved, no right to have authority, and again, it's all part of this total breakdown, and then you are lawless.
[02:57:18.423 --> 02:57:19.404]  It's the same thing.
[02:57:20.592 --> 02:57:22.933]  Well, absolutely, and this couples with everything else.
[02:57:22.953 --> 02:57:24.873]  This also couples with a lack of border security.
[02:57:25.354 --> 02:57:29.075]  You, Mr. American, Mr. Law-abiding citizen, you don't have the right to defend yourself.
[02:57:29.115 --> 02:57:30.255]  You cannot have a firearm.
[02:57:30.595 --> 02:57:33.516]  The people who are walking into this country, we don't even know their names.
[02:57:33.836 --> 02:57:35.937]  They're walking in with a gun in their belt.
[02:57:36.644 --> 02:57:38.145]  And they're hungry and they're desperate.
[02:57:38.465 --> 02:57:41.927]  But you're just going to stand there unarmed and you're going to do absolutely nothing about it.
[02:57:42.168 --> 02:57:43.949]  And we can't put up a wall because that's racist.
[02:57:44.189 --> 02:57:45.250]  And you're just a victim now.
[02:57:45.270 --> 02:57:48.712]  And if you say anything about that, it's because you're a racist white male.
[02:57:48.892 --> 02:57:49.572]  It's insanity.
[02:57:49.973 --> 02:57:50.173]  It is.
[02:57:50.193 --> 02:57:50.793]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:50.813 --> 02:57:51.133]  Stay with us.

[03:00:18.755 --> 03:00:22.359]  He-Man and the Castle of Grayskull!

[03:00:27.525 --> 03:00:33.611]  Here's what happens when you tell San Francisco 49er linebackers that they should go with their emotions.
[03:00:33.731 --> 03:00:34.953]  This is the shocking truth.
[03:00:37.510 --> 03:00:38.991]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[03:00:39.811 --> 03:00:40.572]  It is ma'am.
[03:00:40.812 --> 03:00:42.313]  I can call the police if you'd like me to.
[03:00:42.353 --> 03:00:43.253]  You need to settle down.
[03:00:43.534 --> 03:00:46.035]  You need to settle down and mind your business, okay?
[03:00:46.395 --> 03:00:48.236]  Ma'am, once again, ma'am.
[03:00:48.396 --> 03:00:49.277]  I said both of you.
[03:00:49.637 --> 03:00:50.517]  No, you said sir.
[03:00:51.098 --> 03:00:51.978]  Once again, it's ma'am.
[03:00:52.499 --> 03:00:54.280]  I said both of you guys.
[03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:56.481]  Right beforehand, you f***ing said sir.
[03:00:58.182 --> 03:00:59.823]  Motherf***er, take it outside.
[03:00:59.843 --> 03:01:02.724]  If you want to call me sir again, I will show you a f***ing sir.
[03:01:03.024 --> 03:01:03.345]  Motherf***er.
[03:01:09.504 --> 03:01:10.745]  I need your corporate number!
[03:01:11.165 --> 03:01:15.006]  Because I'm going to call them and talk about how I was misgendered several times in this store!
[03:01:15.306 --> 03:01:16.187]  Alright, let's stop there.
[03:01:16.207 --> 03:01:17.527]  The Lloyd Rage goes on.
[03:01:17.547 --> 03:01:18.428]  So, Andrew Tate.
[03:01:20.288 --> 03:01:24.150]  At a certain point, they teach at colleges that every woman that's a minority is downtrodden and oppressed.
[03:01:24.470 --> 03:01:26.131]  So they can be mean and aggressive and bad.
[03:01:26.171 --> 03:01:34.554]  So now, a man that's 6'4", 260 pounds, looks like he bench presses 500 pounds, he's a victim being mean to a little clerk.
[03:01:35.774 --> 03:01:39.217]  At a certain point, though, this guy's breaking things, threatening people.
[03:01:40.218 --> 03:01:42.300]  And it's just like what we saw with the poor Catholic school kids.
[03:01:42.741 --> 03:01:47.265]  It's okay for them then to get in people's faces because, you know, they're not in a protected group.
[03:01:47.766 --> 03:01:49.788]  At a certain point, these guys are going to get hurt.
[03:01:50.268 --> 03:01:53.111]  I can't believe the incredible restraint of what's going on here.
[03:01:53.351 --> 03:01:55.133]  I mean, what would have happened if you were in that GameStop?
[03:01:56.226 --> 03:01:57.287]  Well, this is the thing.
[03:01:57.387 --> 03:01:59.828]  First thing, I don't know if you've seen, have you seen that guy's criminal history?
[03:01:59.948 --> 03:02:04.730]  Have you seen his other... Oh yeah, I've seen the photo of him with a goatee, all the prison tats.
[03:02:05.010 --> 03:02:06.051]  This is like his new identity.
[03:02:07.031 --> 03:02:13.378]  It's absolutely insane, and this is the thing, like you said, because they believe they're a protected group, they can act however they want.
[03:02:13.838 --> 03:02:17.562]  I am not racist and I'm not bigoted, which means I treat everyone the same.
[03:02:17.582 --> 03:02:27.513]  If you're going to scream in my face and get in my face threateningly, I don't care what you decide to gender yourself, I don't care what colour you are, I'm going to protect myself absolutely, as I should.
[03:02:27.973 --> 03:02:34.175]  So, you're right, but I would be the victim instantly because I hit a transgender person, even though they've completely and utterly started the altercation.
[03:02:34.195 --> 03:02:40.377]  And listen, if somebody looks like a rhinoceros and they're saying, I'm gonna kick your ass, come outside, and they charge you, I can't help it.
[03:02:40.437 --> 03:02:43.718]  I'm gonna hit first, because they're already saying they're going to assault me.
[03:02:43.998 --> 03:02:45.279]  They're charging at me.
[03:02:46.299 --> 03:02:47.440]  You're going to sit and wait?
[03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:49.920]  You're going to sit and wait and see if he hits like a girl or not?
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:51.121]  Because I guarantee he doesn't.
[03:02:51.481 --> 03:02:52.681]  I guarantee he hits like a man.
[03:02:53.182 --> 03:02:55.162]  So it's absolutely insane on every level.
[03:02:55.682 --> 03:02:57.503]  And it goes on to everything.
[03:02:57.543 --> 03:03:03.045]  I mean, what happened there translates perfectly to what happened with the Trump kids and the Native American guy.
[03:03:03.445 --> 03:03:06.786]  Obviously, he was just banging a drum, but the kids reacted perfectly nicely.
[03:03:06.806 --> 03:03:07.667]  They just let him bang it.
[03:03:07.907 --> 03:03:09.507]  And they still tried to pretend they were evil.
[03:03:09.847 --> 03:03:14.049]  If you pass as a white man, you are evil no matter what you do.
[03:03:14.489 --> 03:03:16.990]  If you put on a MAGA hat, then you're definitely evil.
[03:03:17.010 --> 03:03:18.130]  You're not allowed to smile.
[03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:19.810]  You're not allowed to exist.
[03:03:20.070 --> 03:03:21.310]  You're not allowed to procreate.
[03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:22.651]  Everything you do is wrong.
[03:03:23.031 --> 03:03:29.832]  If you were to see a white man and a white woman walk down the street with three or four beautiful children, there's people out there who would be angered by that.
[03:03:30.492 --> 03:03:31.293]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:31.453 --> 03:03:32.293]  How can you be angry?
[03:03:32.313 --> 03:03:35.213]  Well, because the white people decide to procreate because they want to have a loving family.
[03:03:35.453 --> 03:03:36.634]  That's against the rules, is it?
[03:03:36.934 --> 03:03:37.514]  It's insane.
[03:03:37.794 --> 03:03:39.274]  It's absolutely insane on every level.
[03:03:39.294 --> 03:03:40.314]  Let me ask you this.
[03:03:40.354 --> 03:03:40.955]  Let me ask you this.
[03:03:41.015 --> 03:03:42.595]  Where do you see it all ending, then?
[03:03:44.969 --> 03:03:51.331]  I mean, I look at Western Europe, and I was talking to Paul, I met Paul, and Paul's a great guy, obviously, Paul Joseph Watson, etc.
[03:03:52.112 --> 03:03:54.692]  Western Europe, I really think it's gone too far.
[03:03:55.153 --> 03:03:57.293]  America still has people like you fighting for it.
[03:03:57.573 --> 03:04:00.314]  Western Europe has basically nobody left fighting for the country.
[03:04:00.655 --> 03:04:04.896]  And we're being outbred, and censored, and silenced, and invaded.
[03:04:04.916 --> 03:04:07.217]  It's invaded on every level.
[03:04:07.537 --> 03:04:09.378]  And it's going to end one way.
[03:04:09.438 --> 03:04:13.159]  It's going to end with the countries no longer being white Christian nations.
[03:04:13.679 --> 03:04:15.101]  That's the simple reality.
[03:04:15.421 --> 03:04:17.162]  The math proves that with birth rates.
[03:04:17.443 --> 03:04:20.065]  The math proves that with the number of people who are arriving.
[03:04:20.365 --> 03:04:22.727]  That's the ones we know about, let alone the ones we don't know about.
[03:04:22.747 --> 03:04:25.589]  It's just going to end with the destruction of white Christian society.
[03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:28.652]  East Europe and America are the only places left that are resisting.
[03:04:28.712 --> 03:04:31.014]  Russia, East Europe and America are all we have left.
[03:04:31.074 --> 03:04:33.917]  Western Europe is finished in every single way.
[03:04:34.978 --> 03:04:39.241]  And notice the globalists tell us America's bad, Russia's bad, Eastern Europe's bad.
[03:04:39.802 --> 03:04:42.464]  And hey, if these places are so great, let's all move to Africa or the Middle East.
[03:04:42.524 --> 03:04:44.086]  No, they're hellholes.
[03:04:44.506 --> 03:04:46.608]  Andrew Tate, Tate Speech on YouTube.
[03:04:47.169 --> 03:04:47.669]  Great work.
[03:04:47.689 --> 03:04:49.351]  Look forward to having you back on, my friend.
[03:04:49.371 --> 03:04:50.812]  Amazing points and God bless you.
[03:04:51.552 --> 03:04:51.993]  Thank you, Fred.
[03:04:52.533 --> 03:04:55.596]  All right, coming up, Roger Stone's loaded for bears in the War Room, 3 o'clock Central.
[03:04:55.636 --> 03:04:57.558]  Whatever you do, spread those live links.
[03:04:57.578 --> 03:04:59.219]  Without you spreading the word, we're dead in the water.
[03:04:59.239 --> 03:05:00.441]  You spread the links, we all win.
[03:05:06.826 --> 03:05:09.507]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:05:09.867 --> 03:05:15.768]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:28.312]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:05:31.773 --> 03:05:35.514]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[03:05:37.324 --> 03:05:40.105]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply.
[03:05:40.505 --> 03:05:43.446]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:05:45.387 --> 03:05:47.988]  Perfect for work in the car or at home.
[03:05:48.548 --> 03:05:51.329]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:05:51.789 --> 03:05:53.170]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:06:08.735 --> 03:06:12.597]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:13.078 --> 03:06:17.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:20.962]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:06:22.363 --> 03:06:25.705]  Excellent.
[03:06:25.765 --> 03:06:26.465]  Welcome back.
[03:06:27.726 --> 03:06:31.548]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:32.629 --> 03:06:37.732]  Well, it's interesting the way the controversy over the Covington High School students
[03:06:38.445 --> 03:07:06.495]  And the would-be Native American drummer, who claimed to be a Vietnam War hero, but never really served in Vietnam, has eclipsed a much larger story, and that was the media mob frenzy over a report in BuzzFeed that Michael Cohn was ready to testify, or had said, that President Donald Trump directed him to lie to Congress.
[03:07:07.153 --> 03:07:16.336]  Of course, the lynch mob, comprised of the mainstream media and their handmaidens in the Democratic Party, jumped all over this.
[03:07:16.837 --> 03:07:21.978]  And Joaquin Castro, the congressman from Texas, said impeachment was at hand.
[03:07:22.539 --> 03:07:23.899]  There was only one problem.
[03:07:24.339 --> 03:07:26.180]  The story wasn't true.
[03:07:26.986 --> 03:07:31.228]  And incredibly, the special counsel's office batted it down hard.
[03:07:31.768 --> 03:07:51.177]  But this story was wiped off the media landscape by the even more incredible lynch mob that immediately surrounded the mainstream media narrative that a group of wild high school students from Kentucky had menaced this poor Native American.
[03:07:52.173 --> 03:08:07.349]  It's very important for people to understand that it is only because we have still a vibrant, accessible, robust internet access in this country that this story was able to be debunked.
[03:08:08.132 --> 03:08:30.084]  What that means, of course, is that the Internet censors, those who would kill InfoWars, those who have knocked Alex Jones off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of YouTube, off of Spotify, and various other platforms have not yet achieved their goal of communications dominance.
[03:08:31.283 --> 03:08:39.326]  You see, I grew up and was active in politics from the 70s until today, 50 years in the trenches of American politics.
[03:08:40.226 --> 03:08:48.970]  I remember very well when three networks had a virtual stranglehold, indeed a monopoly, on all political discourse.
[03:08:49.530 --> 03:08:57.873]  And therefore, any narrative that the American political media establishment wanted to forward became gospel.
[03:08:58.353 --> 03:08:59.874]  I'll give you a classic example.
[03:09:00.660 --> 03:09:05.504]  Lee Harvey Oswald killed President John F. Kennedy, and he acted alone.
[03:09:06.024 --> 03:09:10.367]  There was no conspiracy, and he was a wild-eyed communist.
[03:09:11.027 --> 03:09:20.534]  Now, thanks to the internet and a group of valiant researchers, who in the beginning had their own work censored, we know better.
[03:09:20.554 --> 03:09:23.896]  And the American people don't even buy that narrative anymore.
[03:09:24.377 --> 03:09:25.678]  In fact, after the
[03:09:27.119 --> 03:09:43.272]  Oliver Stone movie JFK, there was such a hue and cry for the truth that the Congress was forced to empower the House Committee on Assassinations that was limited by the CAA's lack of cooperation.
[03:09:43.672 --> 03:09:50.998]  But even they came forward and said, yes, there was a conspiracy and yes, organized crime.
[03:09:53.351 --> 03:10:02.073]  It's a perfect example of how the Internet has helped spread the truth in the face of a government cover-up.
[03:10:03.013 --> 03:10:10.355]  And why the fight that we face today over Internet censorship is the single most important fight that we face.
[03:10:11.695 --> 03:10:15.756]  Alex Jones has been patient zero in this entire controversy.
[03:10:16.463 --> 03:10:19.186]  InfoWars is the cutting edge.
[03:10:19.266 --> 03:10:21.127]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:10:21.608 --> 03:10:26.753]  We are fearless and we will bring you wherever our reporting leads us.
[03:10:27.273 --> 03:10:29.175]  We're committed only to the truth.
[03:10:30.136 --> 03:10:40.926]  And unlike the mainstream media, unlike CNN or MSNBC and many others, we don't have any multinational corporate sponsors.
[03:10:41.736 --> 03:10:54.159]  No one tells Alex Jones or Roger Stone or David Knight or Paul Joseph Watson or anyone here on InfoWars what we can and cannot cover, what we can and cannot say.
[03:10:54.860 --> 03:11:00.781]  This independence is only available to us because, in essence, we are self-funded.
[03:11:01.421 --> 03:11:11.364]  That means when you go to the InfoWars.com store and you buy one of our products, whether it is one of our cutting-edge nutraceuticals or whether it is a book
[03:11:12.012 --> 03:11:12.793]  Or a t-shirt.
[03:11:13.253 --> 03:11:17.196]  Whether it's Super Male Vitality, for example, now 50% off.
[03:11:17.737 --> 03:11:18.498]  Or bodies.
[03:11:18.938 --> 03:11:23.902]  In my opinion, the single best tumeric formula available in the United States today.
[03:11:24.382 --> 03:11:30.708]  Or you buy my book, Stone's Rules, a manual for success, a field guide to victory.
[03:11:31.208 --> 03:11:34.211]  Or any product at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:11:34.911 --> 03:11:37.353]  You are helping fund the fight for freedom.
[03:11:37.773 --> 03:11:41.555]  You are helping fuel our journalistic independence.
[03:11:42.116 --> 03:11:51.161]  It's only because of your loyal patronage and your support that we can go forward, that we can expand, that we can cover the real news.
[03:11:51.861 --> 03:12:00.827]  Now, had it not been for Infowars and Breitbart, The Daily Caller, The Gateway Pundit, Big League Politics,
[03:12:01.559 --> 03:12:12.768]  Town Hall and so many other great alternative right-leaning media sites, we now know the truth about the Covington High School scandal.
[03:12:13.508 --> 03:12:14.189]  Controversy.
[03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:15.189]  Call it what you like.
[03:12:15.750 --> 03:12:24.176]  What we do know is that the mainstream media narrative that they were prepared to feed us was completely wrong.
[03:12:24.717 --> 03:12:26.418]  But here's the most outrageous thing.
[03:12:27.362 --> 03:12:55.436]  As one who was banned on Twitter well over a year ago, banned at a time that I had over 450,000 followers, banned because I violated their incredibly vague community guidelines, I look at those with the little blue checkmark next to their name on Twitter yesterday who were advocating punching these high school students in the face.
[03:12:56.164 --> 03:12:59.245]  Putting them in their school and burning it to the ground.
[03:12:59.925 --> 03:13:00.725]  Killing them.
[03:13:01.865 --> 03:13:09.387]  I actually saw one actress offering to perform oral sex on anybody who punched one of the students out.
[03:13:10.027 --> 03:13:12.347]  So the question becomes an obvious one.
[03:13:12.787 --> 03:13:15.408]  Where are the community guidelines here?
[03:13:15.948 --> 03:13:20.909]  We know that Keith Olbermann can advocate the violent assassination of Donald Trump.
[03:13:21.509 --> 03:13:32.374]  And he will remain on Twitter, but voices like Roger Stone and Milo and Laura Loomer and Alex Jones and so many others are banned.
[03:13:32.874 --> 03:13:33.214]  Why?
[03:13:33.675 --> 03:13:35.636]  Because we're politically incorrect.
[03:13:36.056 --> 03:13:36.416]  Why?
[03:13:36.716 --> 03:13:47.621]  Because we question radical Islam and its violence and its abuse of women and its abuse of gay people and its potential to destroy this country.
[03:13:48.041 --> 03:13:53.944]  Because we see the danger in Sharia law and the coming efforts to implement it here.
[03:13:53.964 --> 03:14:01.207]  And because we do not want to become the United Kingdom, where one cannot even criticize radical Islam.
[03:14:01.607 --> 03:14:05.049]  And we oppose the sexualization of our children.
[03:14:05.749 --> 03:14:14.433]  And we oppose pedophilia, which Twitter allows on its site, as Mindy Robinson has reported right here on InfoWars.
[03:14:15.091 --> 03:14:18.593]  Yes, this is the single most important fight we face.
[03:14:19.013 --> 03:14:19.794]  What can you do?
[03:14:20.214 --> 03:14:26.898]  Right now, go to RightTrump.com, RightTrump.com, and look at our website.
[03:14:27.458 --> 03:14:41.606]  There, you will find a letter which you can sign to the President, urging him immediately to tell his Justice Department to undertake antitrust action and stop the racketeering of the big tech
[03:14:42.310 --> 03:14:45.791]  Firms that would seek to limit your First Amendment rights.
[03:14:46.131 --> 03:14:49.872]  That would stop you from communicating with other like-minded citizens.
[03:14:50.432 --> 03:14:59.215]  This is a grassroots campaign and Alex Jones personally has agreed to pay for the postage to mail your letter to the President.
[03:14:59.715 --> 03:15:00.415]  Sign your letter.
[03:15:00.635 --> 03:15:10.278]  You can put a personal personalized PS on the letter and we will make sure the President gets your letter this winter in the near future.
[03:15:10.698 --> 03:15:18.361]  There's 50,000 of these sitting in my garage, ready to be delivered to Mar-a-Lago the next time the President comes to Palm Beach.
[03:15:18.922 --> 03:15:19.682]  We'd like it to be 100,000.
[03:15:20.522 --> 03:15:25.545]  So please, go to RightTrump.com and take immediate action.
[03:15:26.025 --> 03:15:39.651]  If you're unhappy with the results of the last election, if you think we shouldn't have lost the House, or maybe we didn't really lose the House, I peg that to Internet censorship and the limiting of the voices of freedom on the Internet.
[03:15:40.211 --> 03:15:41.152]  Don't let it happen.
[03:15:41.493 --> 03:15:43.214]  Don't let them destroy InfoWars.
[03:15:43.274 --> 03:15:44.836]  Don't let them destroy our movement.
[03:15:45.156 --> 03:15:48.320]  And don't let them stop the President's reform agenda.
[03:15:48.820 --> 03:15:49.721]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:15:50.102 --> 03:15:51.603]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:51.843 --> 03:15:54.106]  And I'll be right back with more.
[03:16:02.196 --> 03:16:10.382]  Now to the outrage over a video showing an encounter between teenagers and a Native American veteran near the Lincoln Memorial.
[03:16:10.602 --> 03:16:15.465]  Outrage is growing this afternoon over students who mocked a Native American Vietnam veteran.
[03:16:15.505 --> 03:16:18.407]  A video that is causing outrage for so many.
[03:16:18.427 --> 03:16:25.852]  A Kentucky Catholic high school is facing backlash after footage of students mocking a Native American elder appeared online.
[03:16:25.892 --> 03:16:27.734]  The videos have drawn outrage.
[03:16:28.334 --> 03:16:28.674]  Outrage.
[03:16:28.794 --> 03:16:29.195]  Outrage.
[03:16:29.295 --> 03:16:30.736]  Outrage from all corners.
[03:16:30.776 --> 03:16:33.077]  Here's the video sparking outrage on social media.
[03:16:33.097 --> 03:16:34.999]  Sparked outrage on social media.
[03:16:35.019 --> 03:16:42.744]  A group of teenagers, many wearing Make America Great Again hats, were caught on video taunting a Native American Vietnam veteran.
[03:16:42.764 --> 03:16:53.011]  We are hearing from a Native American elder and Vietnam War veteran speaking to CNN after a disturbing viral video shows a group of teens harassing and mocking him in the nation's capital.
[03:16:53.211 --> 03:16:58.094]  A disturbing viral video shows a mob of teens in Make America Great Again hats
[03:17:00.317 --> 03:17:09.588]  Then Phillips describes the tense moments now being replayed over and over again online when a young man got right in his face.
[03:17:09.748 --> 03:17:10.129]  Watch.
[03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:15.736]  Nathan Phillips was beating his drum and singing an American Indian protest song.
[03:17:15.956 --> 03:17:27.845]  When I was there, and I was standing there, and I seen that group of people in front of me, and I seen the angry faces and all of that, I realized I had put myself in a really dangerous situation.
[03:17:28.005 --> 03:17:38.813]  One young man is captured in a tense moment, now being replayed online, getting right in his face, and mocking his singing and drumming on the day of the Indigenous Peoples' March.
[03:17:39.033 --> 03:17:41.214]  A moment from the march has gone viral.
[03:17:41.274 --> 03:17:44.775]  An interaction between native marchers and a group of high school students.
[03:17:44.915 --> 03:17:48.136]  Videos of the encounter shared widely on social media.
[03:17:48.516 --> 03:17:51.497]  Swiss backlash against the behavior of those Kentucky teens.
[03:17:51.537 --> 03:17:52.598]  You see a lot of red in this.
[03:17:52.638 --> 03:17:53.878]  You see a lot of the MAGA hats.
[03:17:53.898 --> 03:17:57.439]  The smile on his face shows how little respect he had for what he was witnessing.
[03:17:57.459 --> 03:18:07.743]  Clearly these boys are not getting a good education because it makes little sense to angrily chant build the wall to a population with literally zero illegal immigrants.
[03:18:08.283 --> 03:18:09.952]  Who were here long before we were.
[03:18:12.324 --> 03:18:15.886]  Hollywood film producer Jack Morrissey tweeted that he wanted the boys killed.
[03:18:15.906 --> 03:18:24.429]  I know this will come as a huge shock to all of you.
[03:18:24.749 --> 03:18:28.511]  This entire exchange was completely misrepresented in the media.
[03:18:28.551 --> 03:18:31.972]  Left-wing media, of course, claimed that these students were harassing this Native American Indian.
[03:18:32.012 --> 03:18:34.593]  Turns out it was exactly the opposite.
[03:18:34.633 --> 03:18:38.475]  Here's what the mainstream media refused to tell you happened before the exchange.
[03:18:38.835 --> 03:18:40.676]  Look at all these dusty-ass crackers.
[03:18:41.276 --> 03:18:44.217]  With that racist garbage on, look at these dirty-ass crackers.
[03:18:44.597 --> 03:18:46.958]  Ain't gonna be no peace until blood is shed!
[03:18:47.158 --> 03:18:52.300]  I get a little angry looking at this guy, who's gone on CNN and everywhere else, and what a big victim he is.
[03:18:52.500 --> 03:18:55.821]  When they're with a group screaming, we're gonna kill you!
[03:18:55.861 --> 03:19:01.663]  So the media ran a completely fake news story, which resulted in children being threatened with murder.
[03:19:01.783 --> 03:19:06.885]  Today, the Catholic school at the center of that viral confrontation on Capitol Hill is forced to close.
[03:19:06.945 --> 03:19:14.288]  Students now facing death threats, being smeared as racist over video of a clash with a Native American protester at the March for Life.
[03:19:14.328 --> 03:19:18.470]  People are calling now for the students to be killed, their school to be burned down, them to be shot.
[03:19:18.650 --> 03:19:19.571]  Twitter's giving it up, agrees with it.
[03:19:19.591 --> 03:19:22.192]  I heard them saying, build that wall, build that wall.
[03:19:22.872 --> 03:19:26.014]  It makes little sense to angrily chant build the wall.
[03:19:26.255 --> 03:19:27.295]  None of that is true.
[03:19:27.355 --> 03:19:31.698]  We went through the entire video and did not hear a single student chanting build that wall.
[03:19:31.738 --> 03:19:34.740]  There is no evidence at all that anybody said build the wall.
[03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:37.522]  This is the anatomy of how the left always are professional victims.
[03:19:37.562 --> 03:19:39.744]  The left-wing media is actually...
[03:19:40.804 --> 03:19:52.607]  Intending to incite violence, intending to incite a civil war, and is functioning, frankly, as enemy combatants in a civil war that they have already started.
[03:19:58.569 --> 03:19:59.289]  InfoWars.
[03:19:59.649 --> 03:20:01.310]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:20:05.711 --> 03:20:08.332]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.884 --> 03:20:21.749]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:20:21.769 --> 03:20:25.012]  You're listening to Roger Stone on N4.
[03:20:34.196 --> 03:20:42.380]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're on the most talked about, the most controversial, indeed, the most censored show on the face of the planet.
[03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:44.761]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:45.182 --> 03:20:47.563]  We give it to you straight from the shoulder here.
[03:20:47.623 --> 03:20:49.083]  We pull no punches.
[03:20:49.524 --> 03:20:53.986]  We take on the globalists and those who would give us one world government.
[03:20:54.466 --> 03:21:20.409]  We take on the two-party duopoly and the elites of both the Republican and Democratic parties that have led America down the path to endless foreign war, the continued erosion of our civil liberties, a stagnant economy, immigration policies that leave our country and our communities unsafe, and trade policies that have literally sucked the jobs out of America.
[03:21:21.129 --> 03:21:31.937]  And then along came a brash New York billionaire who all the pundits and experts told you had no chance whatsoever of being elected president.
[03:21:32.438 --> 03:21:40.644]  First of all, everyone knew he would be demolished by Jeb Bush in the sweepstakes for the Republican presidential nomination.
[03:21:41.265 --> 03:21:43.006]  Except, of course, he wasn't.
[03:21:43.945 --> 03:21:53.051]  The first-time candidate overcame a field of 17 other more experienced political figures to sweep the Republican nomination.
[03:21:53.712 --> 03:22:02.077]  And it's extraordinary the role that the mainstream media played in building his candidacy, particularly CNN and Fox.
[03:22:02.738 --> 03:22:03.118]  Why?
[03:22:03.478 --> 03:22:06.721]  Was it because they liked his message or thought it was newsworthy?
[03:22:07.181 --> 03:22:07.441]  No.
[03:22:07.821 --> 03:22:12.945]  Because they believed that he was the best foil for the inevitable election
[03:22:13.545 --> 03:22:14.426]  Of Hillary Clinton.
[03:22:15.046 --> 03:22:31.200]  And then, as we've seen before, just as the cable news media particularly sought to build Donald Trump's candidacy in the primary and pre-convention phase, well, they sought to tear down his candidacy in the general election.
[03:22:32.242 --> 03:22:45.325]  The reason he was able to prevail, however, is because we still had and still today have the remnants of a vibrant, accessible and robust alternative media.
[03:22:45.845 --> 03:22:52.027]  And the American people no longer depend solely on network television for their news.
[03:22:52.547 --> 03:22:58.148]  They know if they don't like what they see at NBC or ABC or CBS or
[03:22:58.678 --> 03:23:03.640]  CNN or, dare I say it, MSNBC, they can look elsewhere.
[03:23:04.120 --> 03:23:06.261]  To InfoWars, for example.
[03:23:06.961 --> 03:23:17.005]  And, in all honesty, just as Fox News has begun to move to the center-left, their daytime programming is virtually unwatchable.
[03:23:17.465 --> 03:23:20.406]  It sounds to me almost like a mirror image of
[03:23:21.184 --> 03:23:23.306]  MSNBC and CNN.
[03:23:23.946 --> 03:23:29.690]  All this has done is drive conservative viewers right here to InfoWars.
[03:23:30.210 --> 03:23:34.693]  And that's what scares the daylights out of the ruling elite.
[03:23:35.113 --> 03:23:50.784]  That's what scares the daylights out of those who would end the Trump presidency, remove Donald Trump on some trumped up pretext, either through impeachment or by enacting the 28th Amendment to the Constitution.
[03:23:51.484 --> 03:24:07.653]  And therefore, there has been an unprecedented campaign to smear Alex Jones, to smear InfoWars, to smear me, to smear everyone that appears here at InfoWars, in an unprecedented effort to take away our voice on the Internet.
[03:24:08.173 --> 03:24:15.217]  That's why we're so glad that you continue to join us in ever-increasing numbers, and why you've given us your support.
[03:24:15.777 --> 03:24:17.718]  This is a fight for America.
[03:24:18.536 --> 03:24:48.316]  Now, there was excellent news two days ago when Senator Lindsey Graham signaled that he intends, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he is replacing Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, to look into not only the illegal FISA warrants that were levied against officials in Donald Trump's circle in order to illegally and illicitly spy on his campaign, but he would also reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email.
[03:24:49.256 --> 03:25:02.839]  Well, the use of an illegal and unsecure and secret email meant that her email traffic was totally available to numerous foreign powers, so she endangered national security.
[03:25:03.380 --> 03:25:09.581]  But we now know FBI Director James Comey essentially cleared her before she was even questioned.
[03:25:10.141 --> 03:25:21.488]  And her top aides, including Huma Abedin, her right-hand henchwoman, received immunity prior to their testimony, and they were allowed to destroy their laptop computers.
[03:25:22.028 --> 03:25:25.130]  This has all the classic makings of a cover-up.
[03:25:25.671 --> 03:25:32.595]  Now, when Senator Graham announced his intentions, the results from Senate Democrats were furious.
[03:25:33.923 --> 03:25:36.945]  Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois.
[03:25:37.405 --> 03:25:41.568]  Senator Sheldon, the rich guy, White House from Rhode Island.
[03:25:41.928 --> 03:25:43.689]  Senator Dianne Feinstein.
[03:25:44.110 --> 03:25:49.433]  They were all quick to say that this was inappropriate, that this was ancient history.
[03:25:50.054 --> 03:25:51.035]  Let's get this straight.
[03:25:51.615 --> 03:25:58.901]  It's perfectly all right to continue to chase myths about Russian collusion in Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
[03:25:59.362 --> 03:26:09.730]  But when you begin to examine what actually happened under the Obama NSA and the Obama FBI during the 2016 campaign, well, that's newsworthy.
[03:26:09.790 --> 03:26:11.532]  That's page one stuff.
[03:26:12.248 --> 03:26:20.938]  In fact, Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island said, well, maybe they want to reopen the investigation into Benghazi.
[03:26:21.647 --> 03:26:25.768]  Of course he didn't mean it, but now that you say it, Senator, I think it's a pretty good idea.
[03:26:26.228 --> 03:26:30.990]  Because we've never been told the truth about the attack on our compound there.
[03:26:31.530 --> 03:26:43.534]  No one in their right mind really believes the spin of the Obama administration, that that attack was caused by the one-time showing of a net-based anti-Islamic video in Turkey.
[03:26:44.174 --> 03:26:46.016]  Why was everyone dressed identically?
[03:26:46.436 --> 03:26:48.338]  Why were they in military formation?
[03:26:48.718 --> 03:26:50.680]  Why were they all using the same weapons?
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:54.903]  Why did they already know the floor plan of our facility?
[03:26:55.744 --> 03:26:57.566]  Yes, the truth is yet to come out.
[03:26:57.946 --> 03:27:03.791]  So I hope that Senator Graham will look into what really happened in Benghazi.
[03:27:04.411 --> 03:27:09.316]  Those brave Americans killed in Benghazi deserve nothing less.
[03:27:09.836 --> 03:27:12.138]  But what we see here is a repeated pattern.
[03:27:12.754 --> 03:27:19.717]  The illegal use of FISA warrants, the illegal use of the FBI to infiltrate the Trump campaign.
[03:27:20.317 --> 03:27:29.720]  These are issues that the mainstream media, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, CNN want to push out of the public consciousness.
[03:27:30.240 --> 03:27:37.243]  Instead, we chase every half-baked rumor about what Michael Cohen had for lunch and whether he left half a sandwich.
[03:27:37.944 --> 03:27:42.466]  Now, Michael Cohen says he won't testify openly before the Congress.
[03:27:43.046 --> 03:27:48.988]  The man, as Mayor Giuliani has said, is a proven liar seeking a reduction in his sentence.
[03:27:49.508 --> 03:27:52.689]  Why would we believe at this point anything he has to say?
[03:27:53.370 --> 03:27:57.851]  These are the, Matt, these are the charades going on in Washington.
[03:27:58.331 --> 03:28:05.434]  This is a mainstream media bent on returning us to the Russian collusion myth yet again.
[03:28:06.184 --> 03:28:09.067]  The Washington Post runs a story on page one.
[03:28:09.567 --> 03:28:17.474]  The discussions of a potential Russian real estate development in Russia went on far longer than Michael Cohen initially admitted.
[03:28:18.061 --> 03:28:20.864]  By the way, nothing was ever built or developed in Russia.
[03:28:21.244 --> 03:28:22.305]  Nothing ever happened.
[03:28:22.766 --> 03:28:28.171]  Such a development, had Donald Trump not been elected president, would have been perfectly legal.
[03:28:28.692 --> 03:28:34.197]  But they don't tell you that on page one, above the fold of the New York Times.
[03:28:34.738 --> 03:28:37.761]  This is the epitome of fake news.
[03:28:38.261 --> 03:28:40.904]  And I say to you, so what?
[03:28:41.607 --> 03:28:44.549]  Where's the story about Uranium One?
[03:28:45.009 --> 03:28:57.596]  Where's the prosecution of Bill and Hillary Clinton for taking 145 million smackers from the Russian state-owned energy company when control of 20% of our uranium was on the table?
[03:28:58.076 --> 03:28:59.397]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:59.597 --> 03:29:00.738]  I'll be right back.
[03:29:05.621 --> 03:29:09.363]  We've spent
[03:29:10.799 --> 03:29:12.424]  Two years.
[03:29:14.045 --> 03:29:23.627]  And had to pay top formulators and scientists from the top labs in the country to make what they believed was the best energy drink replacement.
[03:29:23.647 --> 03:29:25.387]  Because energy drinks are bad, on average.
[03:29:25.467 --> 03:29:33.589]  So we had the top formulator and the top natural health guru that advises the Olympic Committee, the NFL, you name it.
[03:29:33.649 --> 03:29:34.749]  That'd pay them a lot of money, too.
[03:29:34.769 --> 03:29:36.490]  And then we had other groups go double-checking.
[03:29:36.510 --> 03:29:43.891]  Because I said, if the average energy drink has 30 cents of product that's actually energy and a bunch of sugar and crap and no minerals or vitamins,
[03:29:44.051 --> 03:29:49.882]  I said, what would happen if we sold something for $50 and it had $20 of product in it?
[03:29:50.663 --> 03:29:52.427]  And they said, that's not even done.
[03:29:52.487 --> 03:29:53.268]  That's impossible.
[03:29:54.441 --> 03:29:55.962]  It's just not, it's not done.
[03:29:56.262 --> 03:29:58.082]  So you have to understand how my brain works.
[03:29:58.122 --> 03:30:00.623]  How, how, how, how I operate.
[03:30:00.863 --> 03:30:08.426]  I said, I want the strongest, most powerful, cleanest, healthiest system with all of the key upload enzymes in it.
[03:30:08.526 --> 03:30:22.111]  Because the body, it doesn't matter how much energy drink you drink after a while, it depletes vitamins and minerals and cofactors and key chemicals that are needed to actually get it through the blood, through the blood-brain barrier, and to the cells in a healthy way without the crash.
[03:30:22.751 --> 03:30:25.634]  So imagine if there was an energy drink without the crash.
[03:30:26.055 --> 03:30:30.259]  Imagine if there was an energy drink without the toxicity and the sugar and all the garbage.
[03:30:30.700 --> 03:30:37.627]  Imagine if there was an energy drink that actually had everything that was really a vitamin and mineral fusion with everything else.
[03:30:37.667 --> 03:30:41.712]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll tell you right now that it is next level.
[03:30:41.912 --> 03:30:42.493]  TurboForce.
[03:30:42.793 --> 03:30:48.558]  Energy, metabolism, alertness, and if you look at the back of the box, it goes into everything it's got, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:30:48.678 --> 03:30:58.888]  And it's got the herbal energy blend that are all these different types of naturally occurring systems within chemicals that are naturally occurring in the plants to help upload it naturally.
[03:30:58.908 --> 03:30:59.588]  And it's all there.
[03:30:59.768 --> 03:31:05.554]  This is someone going to a bunch of top research, we went to four different groups, and saying, give us your plan of the
[03:31:05.954 --> 03:31:09.978]  Next level muscle car in natural, healthy energy.
[03:31:10.078 --> 03:31:14.402]  And again, BrainForce Plus is mainly a nootropic with a little bit of clean energy.
[03:31:14.462 --> 03:31:15.062]  People love it.
[03:31:15.222 --> 03:31:19.646]  This is ultimate pre-workout, but ultimate start your day or take it in the middle of the day.
[03:31:19.847 --> 03:31:22.769]  I quite frankly, BrainForce works so good on me, I can barely take it.
[03:31:22.789 --> 03:31:27.173]  But I need to stay up all night because it goes down, pop one, 10 o'clock at night, I'm good at midnight, I'm up all night.
[03:31:27.253 --> 03:31:29.035]  And then I go to sleep and don't crash from it the next day.
[03:31:29.175 --> 03:31:39.378]  So this compliments Brain Force Plus, but this is a packet form, and quite frankly, I said make it one of the strongest out there on the market, but make it clean and make it good.
[03:31:40.538 --> 03:31:51.481]  Most people, I would suggest you take a quarter packet the first time you take it, because when we got prototypes of this a few months ago in, everyone was bouncing off the walls, and we can't even believe this is legal.
[03:31:51.641 --> 03:31:53.542]  Bouncing off the walls.
[03:31:53.802 --> 03:31:58.363]  Because it has a spectrum of every natural form of caffeine there is.
[03:31:58.763 --> 03:32:03.827]  It's got stuff that has a 4-hour burn rate, a 3-hour burn rate, a 2-hour burn rate, a 1-hour burn rate.
[03:32:03.927 --> 03:32:09.171]  It's got all of these different enzymes that upload it, so you get a way bigger response.
[03:32:09.371 --> 03:32:10.132]  I think this is good.
[03:32:10.632 --> 03:32:13.635]  And I'm proud of it, and you'll use it responsibly.
[03:32:13.655 --> 03:32:20.360]  But I said, give us the most powerful, clean, healthy thing, but in this genre, and I cannot believe we even produced this.
[03:32:20.480 --> 03:32:22.262]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:32:22.502 --> 03:32:23.723]  TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:23.843 --> 03:32:25.844]  I mean, I think you should put a half in your water first.
[03:32:26.044 --> 03:32:28.544]  Why don't you get up in the morning and try this instead of your coffee?
[03:32:28.704 --> 03:32:32.425]  It's hard to even get into why this is so good because there's so many ingredients.
[03:32:32.625 --> 03:32:34.706]  I mean, there's just a ton of ingredients in this, baby.
[03:32:34.846 --> 03:32:35.666]  A ton of ingredients.
[03:32:35.686 --> 03:32:38.587]  This took two years to develop, and it's to the moon without a rocket.

[03:33:06.661 --> 03:33:10.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.191 --> 03:33:20.814]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:33:21.375 --> 03:33:24.718]  You're listening to Roger Stone on Infor.
[03:33:24.738 --> 03:33:28.781]  Welcome back.
[03:33:31.523 --> 03:33:39.926]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're on the most talked about television, video, internet show on the planet.
[03:33:40.126 --> 03:33:42.067]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.667 --> 03:33:46.829]  Now, one thing we have here in abundance at InfoWars is guts.
[03:33:47.549 --> 03:33:49.630]  But the other thing we have is heart.
[03:33:50.310 --> 03:33:56.873]  And now I want to tell you a heart-rendering story about two people I came to know during the presidential campaign.
[03:33:57.702 --> 03:34:05.811]  Joanne DiBartolo and Tom Ravana worked their hearts out for the election of Donald J. Trump in southwestern Florida.
[03:34:06.511 --> 03:34:08.313]  They're not country club Republicans.
[03:34:08.994 --> 03:34:10.936]  They're not professional politicians.
[03:34:11.457 --> 03:34:18.184]  They did so without any remuneration or any promise other than making America great again.
[03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:31.296]  But now, due to a horrific automobile accident caused by an illegal immigrant who was, of course, uninsured, they are on the verge of losing everything.
[03:34:32.128 --> 03:34:41.091]  It's a horrific tale about how they are being defrauded by Chase Bank and are on the verge of losing their home.
[03:34:41.571 --> 03:34:49.053]  And therefore, to tell their story, joining us for the first time, I think, ever, we have Joanne DiBartolo and Tom Ravana.
[03:34:49.493 --> 03:34:52.754]  Thank you so much for jumping on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:53.474 --> 03:34:55.995]  Your story just boggles the mind.
[03:34:56.175 --> 03:34:59.936]  So let's try to tell it chronologically from the beginning.
[03:35:00.476 --> 03:35:10.560]  As I understand it, when Tom suffered a heart attack and Joanne had horrific health problems of her own, you fell a few payments behind in your mortgage payments.
[03:35:11.081 --> 03:35:12.141]  Take it from there.
[03:35:13.762 --> 03:35:14.282]  Hi, Roger.
[03:35:14.322 --> 03:35:15.242]  Thank you for having us.
[03:35:15.442 --> 03:35:16.183]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:35:16.923 --> 03:35:28.748]  What happened was we fell behind on the mortgage payments and then we were, after we healed and recovered from our surgeries, we were working our butts off and
[03:35:30.200 --> 03:35:33.501]  Making up the payments and we were about one.
[03:35:33.581 --> 03:35:37.642]  We were one month behind in our payments and then we got a call from Chicago.
[03:35:37.762 --> 03:35:48.604]  Our my cousin died in a timely death at 60 years old and we it was around Thanksgiving time in 2009 and we went to the funeral.
[03:35:49.664 --> 03:35:53.085]  We couldn't get flights out because they were just so expensive so we ended up driving.
[03:35:53.685 --> 03:35:57.746]  We drove from Southwest Florida up to Chicago and
[03:36:00.047 --> 03:36:19.399]  We went to the funeral services and then the day we were supposed to, the day before we were supposed to come home, we were pulling out of the hotel to go say goodbye to our family and friends when we got t-boned by a high-speeding truck that was trying to blow through the red light.
[03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:25.203]  And when that happened was, he ended up hitting the front of the car
[03:36:26.094 --> 03:36:33.521]  And totaled the car and it was such a high impact it broke Joanne's femur, her tibia, crushed both of her feet.
[03:36:34.041 --> 03:36:41.287]  She had to be rushed to Loyola Hospital in Chicago area and have multiple surgeries.
[03:36:41.307 --> 03:36:43.149]  We were in the hospital for five weeks.
[03:36:43.750 --> 03:36:53.498]  I ended up having, when I got back, when we got back to Florida, I ended up having to have back surgery because I had broken multiple vertebrae and it destroyed my prior back surgery.
[03:36:54.398 --> 03:37:12.183]  So we were also having some issues with our health insurance because the hospital moved up, Joanne, from a hospital setting to a rehabilitation setting.
[03:37:12.603 --> 03:37:17.584]  And once you do that, the insurance wouldn't pay for air transportation.
[03:37:18.204 --> 03:37:19.445]  I ended up calling the insurance.
[03:37:19.625 --> 03:37:20.585]  They wouldn't budge.
[03:37:21.357 --> 03:37:30.102]  So I told Joanne, I said, I'm calling the local news story, news station to see if they could do a story and get the insurance company to pay for our flight.
[03:37:30.762 --> 03:37:45.611]  They came to the hospital, did a story, talked about what happened with the insurance and also our situation that we were dealing with, with the foreclosure, even though we were pretty much caught up with the payments.
[03:37:47.112 --> 03:37:49.573]  The story ran for two days.
[03:37:50.293 --> 03:37:55.838]  And then we, the insurance reconsidered and brought us and flew us back home at the insurance expense.
[03:37:56.399 --> 03:38:03.665]  Joanne went to the hospital for her rehab, and I ended up going home to deal with, you know, things at the house.
[03:38:04.586 --> 03:38:15.736]  And apparently, subsequent to that, the news station got a phone call from somebody asking about what happened to us and about our situation with our bank.
[03:38:17.139 --> 03:38:24.023]  The news station called me and asked if it was okay if I could give them, if they would be able to give them information.
[03:38:24.043 --> 03:38:25.123]  I said sure.
[03:38:25.343 --> 03:38:29.165]  I gave them all the information concerning my bank and with the insurance company.
[03:38:29.185 --> 03:38:33.907]  I didn't know what they wanted to do and never heard anything else from that.
[03:38:34.127 --> 03:38:42.972]  And then in June of 2010, we get a phone call, I get a phone call from the attorney for Chase Bank saying that they have a
[03:38:44.626 --> 03:39:02.881]  satisfaction mortgage and they wanted to know where to mail it or if they wanted me to wanted to have it recorded and I ended up telling him I said just mail it to me so they mailed me the the satisfaction I stuffed it in a drawer and never heard from Chase Bank again until 2014 October.
[03:39:03.961 --> 03:39:10.947]  So in other words a good Samaritan paid off your mortgage and they sent you a mortgage satisfaction.
[03:39:11.579 --> 03:39:27.817]  Now to fast forward here, my understanding is that everything was fine, and then suddenly Chase Bank decides that that was done in error, will answer no questions about how or why it was done, and they're seeking now to take your home.
[03:39:28.477 --> 03:39:37.824]  So, this chain of events and the horrific mistreatment of these two patriots by Chase Bank has put them in harm's way.
[03:39:37.884 --> 03:39:40.906]  They are on the verge of losing their home.
[03:39:41.326 --> 03:39:45.409]  Joanne, tell us what you learned about the case once you looked into it.
[03:39:47.328 --> 03:39:55.534]  Um, what we found out is once we had got an attorney that's been dealing with the case the last four years, we went to trial.
[03:39:55.795 --> 03:39:58.256]  We found out that they presented no evidence.
[03:39:58.677 --> 03:40:02.540]  They couldn't show any evidence that this house was not paid for.
[03:40:02.560 --> 03:40:03.420]  And we
[03:40:06.002 --> 03:40:22.552]  We had the satisfaction and attorneys cannot believe that we went to trial that we went for into court and we went to trial and we did get the house given to us by one of the judges and then they went in for reconsideration and they reversed it and they took the house back.
[03:40:23.373 --> 03:40:33.779]  Then we end up going to trial again we have all the we have evidence and the judge did not want to take any of our evidence none whatsoever but he took all the evidence from the bank
[03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:40.122]  Let's talk about how to fix this now.
[03:40:40.222 --> 03:40:49.891]  First of all, folks, you can help Tom and Joanne, these great brave patriots who are on the verge of losing everything, by going to their GoFundMe account.
[03:40:50.552 --> 03:40:51.073]  There it is.
[03:40:51.173 --> 03:40:51.433]  There.
[03:40:51.533 --> 03:40:52.655]  Go fund me a cow.
[03:40:52.755 --> 03:40:56.460]  Joanne DiBartolo, Tom Ravana.
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:41:06.975]  Secondarily, I urge you now to call or email Chase Bank and demand fair treatment for Joanne DiBartolo and Tom Ravana.
[03:41:07.475 --> 03:41:11.260]  These brave patriots worked their hearts out for Donald Trump.
[03:41:11.781 --> 03:41:15.105]  They have been foot soldiers in the movement.
[03:41:15.205 --> 03:41:20.211]  They are loyal, info warriors, giant fans of Alex Jones.
[03:41:20.331 --> 03:41:24.697]  They seek only one thing, folks, to save their home.
[03:41:25.137 --> 03:41:27.479]  Please, this is a heartbreaking story.
[03:41:27.539 --> 03:41:31.282]  You can read it in greater detail in their GoFundMe page.
[03:41:31.722 --> 03:41:37.647]  I'm calling on all Americans, all InfoWarriors, to help these brave patriots.

[03:42:13.701 --> 03:42:22.584]  We don't do this very often because there are so many worthy causes, but I know these patriots personally, and I know they are selfless.
[03:42:23.144 --> 03:42:28.326]  I know that they have never been compensated a penny for their efforts to save this country.

[03:42:36.529 --> 03:42:42.051]  We're happy to bring you their story, and I ask you again, go to GoFundMe, help these good folks out.
[03:42:42.371 --> 03:42:44.152]  God will bless you for it.

[03:46:20.278 --> 03:46:21.399]  Trump is ridiculous.
[03:46:21.899 --> 03:46:23.360]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[03:46:25.793 --> 03:46:29.576]  But meanwhile, he says we've got burgers stacked a mile high.
[03:46:29.876 --> 03:46:32.757]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[03:46:33.678 --> 03:46:39.261]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners.
[03:46:39.862 --> 03:46:43.404]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him.
[03:46:43.464 --> 03:46:48.166]  And Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least, when he did.
[03:46:48.186 --> 03:46:48.727]  Oh, it's well known.
[03:46:48.767 --> 03:46:52.169]  Trump likes tacos, and Obama likes wieners.
[03:47:06.155 --> 03:47:17.498]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.199 --> 03:47:28.780]  Hi, this is former mayor and the greatest mayor, Mr. 9-11 Rudy Giuliani.
[03:47:29.080 --> 03:47:31.981]  And you're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:47:36.713 --> 03:47:37.453]  Welcome back.
[03:47:38.194 --> 03:47:51.539]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're on the Alex Jones Show, the most talked about, the most censored, the most feared, and the most respected program on the net or on the radio.
[03:47:51.679 --> 03:47:57.081]  People have forgotten the power of talk radio, but Alex Jones hasn't forgotten it.
[03:47:57.682 --> 03:48:08.931]  That's why they seek to censor Mike Savage and why Rush Limbaugh and so many other brave voices are next, because we together are a voice for freedom.
[03:48:09.731 --> 03:48:19.859]  Now, people ask me, since I have known Donald Trump for almost 40 years, what I think will happen regarding the wall.
[03:48:21.222 --> 03:48:28.444]  I think it's pretty clear that the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuckie Cheese Schumer, are in transient.
[03:48:28.884 --> 03:48:32.845]  They have no interest in compromise or negotiation.
[03:48:33.405 --> 03:48:44.087]  Now, some have correctly said that I was the progenitor of the wall as a thematic lift to Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:48:44.608 --> 03:48:46.068]  Let's be very clear about this.
[03:48:46.900 --> 03:48:56.484]  It was Donald Trump himself who came up with the idea of making illegal immigration the centerpiece of his campaign for president.
[03:48:57.424 --> 03:49:16.071]  In fact, when he came down the escalator and in a completely spontaneous free-form announcement speech spoke about the flow of illegals from Mexico, this was a surprise to many on his staff and among his then small circle of advisors.
[03:49:16.787 --> 03:49:28.975]  It was Donald Trump who decided that building a barrier on our southern border, after consultation with many experts in the Border Patrol, would be a keystone of his campaign.
[03:49:29.675 --> 03:49:38.160]  So I simply suggested the concept of the wall because Donald Trump is, at heart, a builder.
[03:49:38.861 --> 03:49:40.882]  He understands how to build things.
[03:49:41.362 --> 03:49:43.964]  And nobody builds better than Trump.
[03:49:44.551 --> 03:49:54.353]  And therefore, I knew that the idea that he could pledge to build a wall would have public credibility, would have public validation.
[03:49:55.193 --> 03:50:05.555]  And he quickly learned by road testing this message at his rallies and on the campaign trail that it had great resonance with the American people.
[03:50:06.415 --> 03:50:13.637]  Now, the one redeeming quality above all others that I could point out to regarding Donald J. Trump
[03:50:14.853 --> 03:50:18.136]  Is his persistence, is his stubbornness.
[03:50:18.896 --> 03:50:21.799]  I don't mean that as a pejorative or as a criticism.
[03:50:21.939 --> 03:50:23.640]  I mean it as praise.
[03:50:24.200 --> 03:50:34.609]  When Donald Trump sets his mind to something, when he commits to something, he will do whatever it takes to make that happen within, of course, the bounds of law.
[03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:36.230]  He is brash.
[03:50:36.610 --> 03:50:37.731]  He is audacious.
[03:50:38.151 --> 03:50:39.092]  He is stubborn.
[03:50:39.492 --> 03:50:42.715]  And he will fight to close our southern border.
[03:50:43.351 --> 03:50:45.693]  In the end, he's also not inflexible.
[03:50:46.113 --> 03:50:47.554]  The wall could be concrete.
[03:50:47.994 --> 03:50:57.561]  The wall could be hemp-derived concrete, as Adam Powers from Nine LLC showed us the other day on The War Room.
[03:50:57.961 --> 03:51:00.063]  It could be a steel slap fence.
[03:51:00.843 --> 03:51:03.025]  There's a number of alternatives.
[03:51:03.665 --> 03:51:13.796]  And the president came forward with a compromise proposal because DACA is so important to the Democrats, he showed some real flexibility.
[03:51:14.497 --> 03:51:20.403]  That olive branch was slapped out of his hands before he could even get the proposal out of his mouth.
[03:51:21.013 --> 03:51:38.700]  It shows you that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and the House and Senate Democrats, all of whom have given lip service to sealing our borders, all of whom have talked about the need for a barrier on our southern border, have no interest whatsoever.
[03:51:39.340 --> 03:51:41.341]  What's their political calculus?
[03:51:41.521 --> 03:51:42.681]  Well, it's twofold.
[03:51:43.462 --> 03:51:48.964]  One, we're now at a time in America where if Donald Trump is for something,
[03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:53.465]  Well, then his critics and opponents are against it no matter what.
[03:51:54.366 --> 03:51:58.250]  Case in point, our withdrawal of troops from Syria.
[03:51:59.051 --> 03:52:03.416]  Our intended and announced withdrawal of more troops from Afghanistan.
[03:52:03.997 --> 03:52:06.299]  Our eventual withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
[03:52:07.683 --> 03:52:12.607]  When I was starting in American politics, the American left was anti-war.
[03:52:13.127 --> 03:52:17.991]  But if Donald Trump wants to end the war, well, that means we're for more war.
[03:52:18.551 --> 03:52:19.832]  It makes no sense.
[03:52:20.412 --> 03:52:34.583]  Or take the president's historic package of criminal justice reform to end the practice of sending people to prison for first-time nonviolent crimes
[03:52:35.103 --> 03:52:41.286]  No, the president finally did something about what I consider to be one of the most ignominious racist failures in our criminal justice system.
[03:52:53.502 --> 03:53:04.328]  But incredibly, a handful of House Democrats, themselves African Americans, including John Lewis of Georgia, voted against the President's package.
[03:53:04.829 --> 03:53:09.591]  Voted against something that they themselves have been calling for for decades.
[03:53:10.212 --> 03:53:10.592]  Why?
[03:53:11.212 --> 03:53:16.515]  Simply because Donald Trump was for it, and for no other reason.
[03:53:17.776 --> 03:53:20.698]  It really is quite extraordinary to see this
[03:53:23.570 --> 03:53:24.251]  Thank you.
[03:53:29.577 --> 03:53:47.224]  Broadcast and published a fake story saying that the president had instructed Michael Cohen to lie about the real estate development that was anticipated or discussed but never actually undertaken in Russia.
[03:53:47.704 --> 03:53:49.824]  Why all hell broke loose.
[03:53:50.105 --> 03:53:55.387]  It was a media feeding frenzy the likes of which I hadn't seen since the 1970s.
[03:53:57.270 --> 03:53:59.171]  That is where we are now.
[03:53:59.651 --> 03:54:12.218]  The most amazing thing was watching a woman on Buzz, pardon me, on CNN trying to argue that BuzzFeed is a legitimate media organization.
[03:54:13.699 --> 03:54:14.899]  It boggles the mind.
[03:54:15.319 --> 03:54:19.942]  BuzzFeed is where one goes if one wants to see cat videos.
[03:54:20.672 --> 03:54:26.597]  Then I turned on Family Guy, and I saw this little clip, which really kind of tickled my heart.
[03:54:26.857 --> 03:54:28.158]  Let's roll that, if we may.
[03:54:29.519 --> 03:54:30.060]  Two levels.
[03:54:32.722 --> 03:54:35.964]  Folks, to drink this evening, we've got red wine, white wine, and a fifth of bourbon.
[03:54:36.505 --> 03:54:38.847]  Will you have disgraced political oddity, Roger Stone?
[03:54:39.227 --> 03:54:39.928]  I'll take the fifth.
[03:54:40.528 --> 03:54:40.728]  Heh.
[03:54:41.049 --> 03:54:42.089]  That works on two levels.
[03:54:44.832 --> 03:54:45.592]  There you have it.
[03:54:46.353 --> 03:54:47.754]  I've been immortalized.
[03:54:48.575 --> 03:54:50.016]  You know, they say that there are
[03:54:50.959 --> 03:54:53.941]  Uh, several phases of fame.
[03:54:54.622 --> 03:54:57.144]  Phase one, who is Roger Stone?
[03:54:57.844 --> 03:55:00.526]  Phase two, get me Roger Stone.
[03:55:01.067 --> 03:55:04.509]  Phase three, get me a Roger Stone type.
[03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:07.832]  Phase four, who is Roger Stone?
[03:55:08.504 --> 03:55:19.787]  I'll be joining Tucker Carlson tonight on Tucker Carlson Tonight to talk about the horrific effects of the Mueller witch hunt on my family and its financial survival.
[03:55:20.107 --> 03:55:31.810]  If you want to help me, you can go to StoneDefenseFund.com and tune in to see Tucker Carlson tonight and I will talk about the devastating effect this has had on me and my family.
[03:55:32.384 --> 03:55:35.046]  Thank you for joining me on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:55:35.186 --> 03:55:50.519]  It's been my pleasure to bring you the heart-rendering story of Joanne DiBartolo and Tom Rabana and their fight against the giant Wall Street bank, Chase, to steal their home, even though its mortgage has been satisfied.
[03:55:51.039 --> 03:56:00.747]  And now, while you're in a generous mood, take a moment not only to go to their GoFundMe site, but go to the InfoWars.com site one more time.
[03:56:01.327 --> 03:56:08.853]  The fact that we can bring you this programming is only made possible by your loyal support and patronage at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:56:09.233 --> 03:56:22.782]  So whether it is a t-shirt, a book, or one of our great cutting-edge nutraceuticals, you can know with confidence when you buy anything or contribute on the InfoWars.com store site, you're supporting the fight for freedom.
[03:56:23.083 --> 03:56:25.885]  You're supporting the fight against internet censorship.
[03:56:26.205 --> 03:56:30.668]  You're supporting the fight against the globalists who would move us to
[03:56:30.888 --> 03:56:32.149]  One world government.
[03:56:32.649 --> 03:56:34.471]  We are a beacon of freedom.
[03:56:34.891 --> 03:56:36.512]  We are the cutting edge.
[03:56:36.652 --> 03:56:38.494]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:56:38.894 --> 03:56:53.565]  And therefore, those in the Democratic Party, those in the two-party ruling elite, those and their handmaidens in the tech company will go to no limited lengths to destroy us, to limit us, to silence us.
[03:56:53.945 --> 03:56:55.386]  But we will never quit.
[03:56:55.787 --> 03:56:57.008]  We will never falter.
[03:56:57.348 --> 03:56:58.549]  We will never fold.
[03:56:58.749 --> 03:56:59.970]  We will fight.
[03:57:00.470 --> 03:57:02.311]  But you have to have our back.
[03:57:02.651 --> 03:57:06.654]  Please go to the Infowars.com site now and make a contribution.
[03:57:07.034 --> 03:57:10.416]  Go to the Stone Defense Fund site, make a contribution.
[03:57:10.716 --> 03:57:11.997]  Help Tom and Joanne.
[03:57:12.317 --> 03:57:13.198]  They need your help.
[03:57:13.558 --> 03:57:16.720]  We will all fight together for a better America.
[03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:20.582]  One thing you can bet on, Alex Jones will never fold.
[03:57:21.082 --> 03:57:32.471]  Infowars will never quit, because we stand for the Constitution and the freedom, and because we want the same opportunity for our children and grandchildren that we have had.
[03:57:32.811 --> 03:57:34.272]  This is what we fight for.
[03:57:34.572 --> 03:57:37.835]  Thanks for joining me on the Alex Jones Show, and God bless you.
[03:57:52.591 --> 03:57:55.494]  Today's left thinks that America is just another country.
[03:57:56.335 --> 03:57:59.357]  Just one of the 190 some countries on the planet.
[03:57:59.758 --> 03:58:02.020]  United States of America is not just another country.
[03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:08.706]  It's the greatest nation in history that has done more good for more people than any country ever.
[03:58:09.026 --> 03:58:12.169]  A special place where people from all over the world
[03:58:13.290 --> 03:58:23.453]  All shapes, all sizes, all colors, all talents come to so they can chase down their goals, chase down their dreams, make life better for themselves and their family.
[03:58:23.493 --> 03:58:24.493]  That's this country.
[03:58:25.093 --> 03:58:32.815]  A special place where people come and respect the Constitution, cherish the Bill of Rights, and embrace the rule of law.
[03:58:33.415 --> 03:58:36.576]  Democrat Congressman Blumenauer said, abolish ICE.
[03:58:37.822 --> 03:58:43.786]  Secretary Clinton, when she was running for the highest office in the land, said we need a borderless hemisphere.
[03:58:43.866 --> 03:58:56.953]  We've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, I will continue speaking out for comprehensive immigration reform.
[03:58:57.193 --> 03:58:59.595]  I think the people who are here deserve
