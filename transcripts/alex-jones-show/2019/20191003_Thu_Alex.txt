[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:08.074]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:22.863]  Well, it's well known that under Obama, and the bag man was Joe Biden, the sellout to China was even more intense than it had been under the Clintons.
[00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:32.167]  Bush turned a blind eye to a lot of it, but the Clintons aggressively sold out basically all the secrets we had in the 90s.
[00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:41.114]  Missile secrets, technology transfers, one-sided trade deals, let them into the WTO as a developing country under different rules to totally screw us.
[00:00:41.614 --> 00:00:42.455]  It's all one-sided.
[00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:54.114]  But when Trump came out in a speech today and said, oh, I might ask China about the corruption of the Bidens, the media is spinning it that they mean Ukraine.
[00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:55.576]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:05.888]  It's a threat to China that we know your bag man is Biden, and Biden and his company's got over a billion dollars for it, and I'm about to bring down your spies.
[00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:09.170]  The media's trying to spin that, that, oh, see, he's a traitor!
[00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.853]  He's putting pressure on foreign countries to go after Americans that he's running against.
[00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:17.735]  Biden isn't going to make it to election.
[00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:18.115]  Watch.
[00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:19.616]  He's had another stroke.
[00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:20.297]  He can't talk.
[00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:26.897]  But the big treason is transferring missile secrets and completing that, and Obama did that.
[00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:27.638]  It's high treason.
[00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:28.258]  Here's the report.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:43.730]  While Congress engulfs itself in fantasy impeachment world, while the Squad, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and the media push racial guilt, totalitarianism, and division deeper into our culture, while the U.S.
[00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:50.256]  border remains open to enemy infiltration and our bureaucracies protecting that border are demonized,
[00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:03.243]  The US Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.
[00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.889]  The Texas Department of Public Safety has reported that border security agencies
[00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:08.650]  We're good.
[00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:40.178]  and the US military focuses on politically correct diversity, the Communist Chinese subtly announced that wiping democracies off the face of the earth is now a reality.
[00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:55.869]  During their 70th anniversary celebration of Communist rule, President Xi spoke of how Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong had stood in the same spot 70 years ago and declared the founding of the People's Republic of China
[00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:02.337]  Paving the way for the country to embark on the path of the Great Rejuvenation of China, Xi said,
[00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:14.310]  Tell us about this missile, why it's such a national security nightmare for our country.
[00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:42.607]  Well it's the idea that they have, they had 20 of these missiles, a very old-fashioned obsolete kind for most of the last few decades.
[00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:44.368]  Now suddenly they've got 90.
[00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:49.731]  They're able to reach any target in America in 30 minutes or less.
[00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:51.513]  Each one can carry
[00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.414]  10 H-bombs.
[00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.155]  That big round sort of nose cone you saw?
[00:03:56.575 --> 00:04:06.120]  The shape of that nose cone is that the 10 H-bombs can fit inside and each one be separately targeted against an American city or a small town or an Air Force base.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.062]  A hypersonic weapons arms race is now in full swing as U.S.
[00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:20.007]  company Lockheed Martin is developing a tactical boost glide weapon for DARPA and a hypersonic conventional strike weapon for the Air Force.
[00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:25.890]  Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are teaming up to build engines for hypersonic weapons.
[00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.794]  Raytheon is also working on defense capabilities against hypersonic weapons, while Russia is developing a hypersonic glide vehicle.
[00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:43.158]  But back here in cuckoo land, fools like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi weakened our defenses and set the U.S.
[00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:48.921]  on a course to submission to the communist infiltration of every aspect of our country.
[00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:53.905]  How do you envision working with this president on these key democratic agenda items?
[00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.267]  Lowering prescription drug costs.
[00:04:55.987 --> 00:05:02.073]  You know, ensuring tougher gun safety measures as you're actively considering whether to remove him from office.
[00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:03.615]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:13.725]  There is a report that came out just before you and President Ninister walked out here that the whistleblower met with a staff member of Adam Schiff prior to the complaint being filed.
[00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.565]  It shows that Schiff is a fraud.
[00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:17.426]  I love that question.
[00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:18.426]  Thank you, John.
[00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:19.566]  Can I finish asking it?
[00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.367]  Yes, there's nothing to finish.
[00:05:21.987 --> 00:05:27.508]  So the whistleblower, according to this report, met with a member of Adam Schiff's staff.
[00:05:27.768 --> 00:05:28.528]  You got it right there?
[00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:29.188]  You know it?
[00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:30.908]  I hate to say it, it's the New York Times.
[00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:31.909]  I can't believe they wrote it.
[00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:34.309]  Maybe they're getting better.
[00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.390]  Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the complaint?
[00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.971]  Well, I think it's a scandal that he knew before.
[00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.555]  I go a step further, I think he probably helped write it.
[00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:46.758]  Okay?
[00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:47.659]  That's what the word is.
[00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:52.508]  And I think it's, I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.
[00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:55.053]  Just happened as I'm walking up here, they handed it to me.
[00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.880]  And I said to Mike, I said, whoa, that's something.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.661]  That's big stuff.
[00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:01.261]  That's a big story.
[00:06:02.022 --> 00:06:04.383]  He knew long before, and he helped write it, too.
[00:06:05.183 --> 00:06:05.863]  It's a scam.
[00:06:06.403 --> 00:06:07.024]  It's a scam.
[00:06:07.644 --> 00:06:09.665]  Just to finish on this, I appreciate it.
[00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.546]  I love that second question, by the way.
[00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:12.966]  Should have asked it first.
[00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:18.449]  But let me just tell you, the whole thing is a scam.
[00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:21.210]  The Mueller deal was a scam.
[00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.611]  The Russian collusion was a scam.
[00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:26.192]  You can ask Putin.
[00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:29.636]  Nobody's been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
[00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:30.457]  Okay?
[00:06:30.877 --> 00:06:33.260]  Now, with that being said, it'd be great to get along with Russia.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.863]  And we will get along with Russia, because it's smart.
[00:06:36.403 --> 00:06:40.388]  But nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
[00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:44.470]  I don't know, but Adam Schiff has never been afraid of a microphone.
[00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.410]  He's never met a camera he didn't love.
[00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:49.032]  And frankly, he's never met a camera he didn't lie to.
[00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.954]  Adam Schiff is basically the Jussie Smollett of Congress on steroids.
[00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:56.075]  I've never seen anything so ridiculous.
[00:06:56.415 --> 00:07:02.637]  And if a Republican member of Congress tried to get away with this, the media would be all over them.
[00:07:02.677 --> 00:07:03.918]  They wouldn't just accept it.
[00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.259]  You had people, what was it, BuzzFeed today?
[00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:11.222]  Well, it doesn't really matter that Adam Schiff lied to us, because he's pushing our agenda.
[00:07:11.562 --> 00:07:12.683]  He's pushing our narrative.
[00:07:13.023 --> 00:07:15.624]  More importantly, Sean, the American people see it.
[00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:16.405]  They get it.
[00:07:16.705 --> 00:07:17.826]  They see Nancy Pelosi.
[00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:21.248]  Oh, we'd like to maybe talk about healthcare and maybe USMCA.
[00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:24.850]  They haven't done anything in three years, Sean.
[00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.051]  They haven't tried to do one single piece of legislation.
[00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:28.912]  The reality is this.
[00:07:29.472 --> 00:07:32.074]  They hate Trump more than they love America.
[00:07:32.374 --> 00:07:38.218]  And more importantly, they want to resist Trump more than they ever wanted to work for their constituency.
[00:07:38.618 --> 00:07:39.379]  It's disgusting.
[00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.461]  This president has accomplished unprecedented things.
[00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:46.663]  Imagine what he could do with a little bit of cooperation from the Democrats.
[00:07:47.064 --> 00:07:47.764]  Just a little bit.
[00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:48.945]  And he's got none of it.
[00:07:49.405 --> 00:07:57.911]  That he can do what he has done, despite unprecedented incoming, unlike anything any president has seen before, is truly a miracle.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.649]  Joe Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company.
[00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:07.453]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[00:08:08.174 --> 00:08:08.995]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:08:10.504 --> 00:08:11.104]  Got fired.
[00:08:11.385 --> 00:08:19.849]  But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him, and their media lapdogs fall in line.
[00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.450]  They lost the election.
[00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.811]  Now, they want to steal this one.
[00:08:24.432 --> 00:08:25.312]  Don't let them.
[00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:28.434]  I'm Donald Trump, and I approve this message.
[00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:36.678]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, October 3rd, 2019, worldwide transmission.
[00:08:39.707 --> 00:08:48.112]  I don't want to apologize to listeners, but I did yell and scream and say a lot of mean things yesterday, and I meant every word of it.
[00:08:50.093 --> 00:08:56.037]  But still, I really had a big, powerful, informative, professional show lined up for you.
[00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:00.630]  The problem is I over-prepared, and that is when I tend to blow up.
[00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.251]  Over the years I've learned these patterns.
[00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:09.154]  Sometimes when I'm the most unprepared, I have some of the best, most in-depth broadcasts, because I'm already super prepared.
[00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:10.295]  I've already done a ton of research.
[00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:21.100]  It's just that when I sit here for three, four hours getting ready, it's almost, I don't want to say depressing, but it's frustrating.
[00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:24.693]  And I understand that it frustrates you as well.
[00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:36.226]  A lot of people tell me, I tune in for years, I know it's accurate, but then I just kind of give up, but then something really bad happens, and then I just realize I've got to tune back in and then I've got to take action.
[00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:37.688]  And listen, I totally get it.
[00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:43.915]  If I ever got off this horse, if I ever got off this treadmill, I'd probably never come back.
[00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:49.296]  I used to run like six miles every other day, lift weights two hours a day.
[00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:51.177]  I was addicted just to the endorphins.
[00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:58.680]  And when I was about 22, I was already successful in local TV and then talk radio and I needed to go full time.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.461]  So I basically quit working out.
[00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.902]  Just for a month or two, I was making a film.
[00:10:04.242 --> 00:10:10.365]  So I was working 18 hours a day to get that done and do all the other jobs, including my day job.
[00:10:11.687 --> 00:10:13.488]  I literally work 20 hours a day a lot of days.
[00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:16.349]  For weeks, I would sleep four hours a night.
[00:10:16.609 --> 00:10:22.491]  I mean, a lot of companies and medical degrees and things are done like that, but I'm not the only guy that does that.
[00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:23.551]  Millions of Americans have done it.
[00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:25.612]  In fact, behind most success, there's that type of work.
[00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:34.295]  But somehow, after I didn't work out for a few months, I just never went back for 10 years, and I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:41.318]  And I use that allegory of, I know why Americans are punched out of politics.
[00:10:43.464 --> 00:10:46.626]  Because it just seems so daunting, so big, so out of control.
[00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:50.068]  But I'm here to tell you, you don't have a choice.
[00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:59.754]  If you submit to this, it's going to be a lot more hellish and a lot more hard work than actually fighting it.
[00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:03.576]  I mean, being a slave is not fun in a technocracy.
[00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:08.716]  And this isn't like, oh, you know, the time of our children is going to be really bad.
[00:11:09.176 --> 00:11:10.756]  People have been saying that for 50 years.
[00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:13.176]  Well, it's the time of the children and their children.
[00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:32.360]  There's grandchildren out there, since folks were saying, if we keep letting America go socialist, if we keep letting America go communist, if we keep letting the morals be taken out of society, we'll end up with a huge, decadent, evil system with pedophilia, bestiality, broken families, devil worship.
[00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:38.576]  Killing of the already born, killing of the old, drug addicts, homeless everywhere.
[00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:39.837]  It's here.
[00:11:40.778 --> 00:11:42.300]  We have arrived.
[00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:45.703]  And it's like arriving at the foothills.
[00:11:45.763 --> 00:11:50.808]  You're kind of climbing up a foothill and it's kind of rough and tough until you go over that foothill and you see a real mountain.
[00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:55.292]  If you think stuff's bad now, these are the foothills.
[00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.331]  Or it's kind of like coming to the edge of a forest, there's little 3 foot, 5 foot, 10 foot trees.
[00:12:02.991 --> 00:12:05.772]  You keep marching a couple hours, you're in 100 foot, 200 foot trees.
[00:12:06.452 --> 00:12:10.474]  If you want to use, you know, evil being trees, or evil being mountains, or how about evil being rat holes?
[00:12:10.954 --> 00:12:13.795]  We're a little bit down the rat hole, but we're in the rat hole.
[00:12:14.655 --> 00:12:15.575]  We're in the spider hole.
[00:12:17.856 --> 00:12:21.237]  And just those three videos I played, there's a lesson to all of them.
[00:12:21.797 --> 00:12:23.178]  You know, I like Don Jr.
[00:12:23.218 --> 00:12:24.238]  He's a great guy, smart guy.
[00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.496]  But he's holding back.
[00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:29.958]  It's not that the Democrats hate Trump more than they love America.
[00:12:30.298 --> 00:12:31.098]  They're globalists.
[00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:36.500]  They openly say they hate the country and that it sucks and it's the worst nation on earth and it was never great.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.361]  It'll never be great.
[00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:39.442]  So see, stop sugarcoating.
[00:12:40.062 --> 00:12:42.043]  Well, that sounds extreme to say they hate America.
[00:12:42.523 --> 00:12:43.923]  If it's true, it's true!
[00:12:43.943 --> 00:12:45.524]  No more games!
[00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.865]  Only admitting how bad it is will fix it.
[00:12:50.046 --> 00:12:50.446]  Stop it!
[00:12:52.355 --> 00:13:00.682]  An example is the video that the RNC put out has 100 million views as of this morning, just the two copies I went and found.
[00:13:01.042 --> 00:13:01.522]  Well, guess what?
[00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:04.565]  I went back before the show, one of the videos was already gone.
[00:13:05.005 --> 00:13:09.189]  Then there was another video that was viral that I saw last night that I was going to give the producers.
[00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:11.270]  It had millions of views last night.
[00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:12.031]  It's gone.
[00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:19.117]  They're taking the RNC videos down on Twitter and Facebook because Biden said so.
[00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:22.350]  Think we're down the rat hole a little bit here?
[00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:29.540]  Last year it's Alex Jones, this year it's the RNC, it's Mitch McConnell's Twitter, and it's Donald Trump.
[00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:36.370]  That's why Kamala Harris is running around saying, take Trump's Twitter away from him.
[00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:43.772]  And all the reason they're taking these videos down is it shows Joe Biden two days ago going, I never met with Ukrainians.
[00:13:43.892 --> 00:13:46.994]  I know nothing about my co-kid, alcoholic son.
[00:13:47.414 --> 00:13:48.315]  Oh, he left that part out.
[00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:49.635]  He got washed out of the Navy.
[00:13:50.176 --> 00:13:51.436]  He got kicked out of the Navy.
[00:13:52.877 --> 00:13:54.818]  And then was given this job looting billions.
[00:13:55.739 --> 00:13:56.419]  It's not millions.
[00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.561]  He told you about it six years ago.
[00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:01.762]  Yeah, six years ago, we broke it.
[00:14:03.607 --> 00:14:07.090]  So, there's a lot of angles to all this, but those videos have been taken down.
[00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.994]  Because Biden's saying, I know nothing, I never met Ukrainians, I've never been there.
[00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:13.856]  All these photos with him, that Tucker Carlson got.
[00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:15.778]  Because there's more out now, not just the one.
[00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.240]  Videos are reportedly about to come out.
[00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:22.464]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, but you gotta decide which side you're on.
[00:14:23.064 --> 00:14:27.188]  Listen, I know our general audience has, but I'm talking to all the folks that tune in that think this is funny.
[00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:28.329]  It's not funny.
[00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:32.328]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:14:32.368 --> 00:14:33.088]  to 3 p.m.
[00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:45.758]  Central, the broadcast that the Globalist and their CHICOM minions have worked to shut down is here live on air in defiance of their edict that we be taken off.
[00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:47.979]  I am in your hands.
[00:14:49.173 --> 00:14:52.238]  InfoWars is your weapon of truth.
[00:14:52.979 --> 00:14:54.602]  You decide how to share it.
[00:14:54.943 --> 00:14:56.365]  You decide how to promote it.
[00:14:56.726 --> 00:15:01.554]  You decide how to protect it and fund it and pray for it.
[00:15:03.558 --> 00:15:09.746]  But you have my commitment that I'll never back down, I'll never give in, I can't be bought off, and I can't be intimidated.
[00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:11.948]  I can be destroyed, though.
[00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:16.995]  But that process is going to be extremely damaging to the globalists.
[00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:19.277]  And I am extremely honored.
[00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.020]  But just understand,
[00:15:22.383 --> 00:15:23.984]  Punch, we throw, and then full wars.
[00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:28.728]  It's might and it's strength is your will and your support, your prayers.
[00:15:29.308 --> 00:15:34.673]  And you put your will and support into that fist, it will crush the enemy like a hammer.
[00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:43.360]  We've already put a lot of strong blows into their ribs, and into their eyes, and into their kidneys.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:49.524]  But when we get done with the globalists, we are going to rip their head from their shoulders.
[00:15:50.606 --> 00:15:52.107]  And throw them into a pit.
[00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:53.827]  Politically.
[00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.370]  Now let's get into it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.651]  Let's break it all down.
[00:16:06.442 --> 00:16:11.106]  President Trump threw down the gauntlet today in his latest statement.
[00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:13.467]  We'll play it at the start of the next segment when I go over it all.
[00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:22.054]  But the media, again, did their best job to spin what was an open threat and a dropping of the hammer.
[00:16:23.155 --> 00:16:27.798]  Because Trump wouldn't trot that out unless he was about to use it.
[00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:29.560]  So we'll break that down.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.562]  The Hairlips, the Admiral, start of the next segment.
[00:16:32.642 --> 00:16:33.543]  I'm going to get to it.
[00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:37.129]  But I need time to break it all down.
[00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:48.652]  This country is in a war and it's important to analyze who the Axis powers are versus what America is and what America represents.
[00:16:49.452 --> 00:16:54.393]  And it's critical to understand there's forces from both sides inside each other's nations.
[00:16:55.153 --> 00:16:59.014]  But it's been set up by the globalists that China was to absorb and dominate
[00:16:59.974 --> 00:17:09.543]  What's left of Christendom that would then be overrun with Islamicists to complete our journey into Balkanization and a divided and conquered great game stratagem.
[00:17:11.224 --> 00:17:24.256]  Well, the globalist gambits have been failing because their plan is inherently authoritarian and inherently unfair and inherently devoid of paying attention to history.
[00:17:25.017 --> 00:17:27.419]  We'll talk about that as well next segment.
[00:17:28.695 --> 00:17:30.877]  And then I said I'd get to this yesterday, but I didn't.
[00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:32.059]  But I will.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:40.407]  In fact, I'm going to get to it at the start of the next hour.
[00:17:40.908 --> 00:17:50.078]  I'm going to spend several segments playing video for the official Communist Chinese 70th anniversary that happened two days ago, one day ago here in the U.S.
[00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:59.115]  And just how ominous the whole situation is and how illustrative it is of the type of system we're facing.
[00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:04.139]  And then Communist Chinese adopted policy.
[00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:18.031]  Books written by the Communist Party adopted as their war college doctrine for unrestricted warfare.
[00:18:22.443 --> 00:18:36.005]  And they admit in the manuals that are public, that I will show you, that are actually free online, it's on Scribe, how they're shipping fentanyl in to kill us.
[00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:43.847]  And how Democrat-comparty cities are on Chinese mafia payrolls and are willfully delivering it.
[00:18:43.887 --> 00:18:50.488]  And that's why they're saying everyone can lay out on the streets, everyone can do it, because they've been paid to kill their constituents.
[00:18:53.462 --> 00:18:56.784]  Now I'm going to read to you from the Chinese Pentagon.
[00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:00.947]  That's Next Hour.
[00:19:02.668 --> 00:19:11.293]  So remember, when Nancy Pelosi says MS-13 are God's children, that's because they work for the Chinese Mafia, which is the Communist Party.
[00:19:14.796 --> 00:19:17.057]  Same Chinese Mafia that's attacking the folks in Hong Kong.
[00:19:17.797 --> 00:19:18.498]  It's interchangeable.
[00:19:19.518 --> 00:19:21.540]  Chinese Mafia just became the Communist Party.
[00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:26.774]  Most of their leaders were the grandpas in the Chinese triads.
[00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:37.079]  So the Democratic Party's 100% against this country, and Obama handed over the codes, Obama handed over everything, and that's all confirmed declassified.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.783]  This was all allowed, this was all prepared by Brennan and other America haters.
[00:19:50.063 --> 00:19:51.805]  And the Pentagon knows all this.
[00:19:52.265 --> 00:20:00.272]  You know, I could play you, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expert on China, the expert at the Pentagon.
[00:20:00.292 --> 00:20:03.154]  Would you like me to play an hour-long interview he did, saying all this?
[00:20:04.816 --> 00:20:10.160]  Would you like me to... You know, I'll just read what the Communist Chinese Party military official doctrine is.
[00:20:10.881 --> 00:20:17.667]  It's to ship in thousands of tons of fentanyl, enough to kill a hundred billion people,
[00:20:19.326 --> 00:20:22.989]  They just caught 25 tons coming in, 50,000 pounds, that's enough to kill.
[00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.972]  I said 10 billion, 606 million.
[00:20:26.352 --> 00:20:28.875]  The Epoch Times analysis said it's 11 billion.
[00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:31.257]  That's a Justice Department number.
[00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:32.198]  We rounded down.
[00:20:32.238 --> 00:20:38.083]  It's actually, if you use the actual medical number, it's 10,606,000,000 and change, but who's counting?
[00:20:38.984 --> 00:20:39.984]  That's just one shipment.
[00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:42.507]  Just a couple of containers.
[00:20:45.598 --> 00:20:57.541]  So, just remember, when you see Democrats, they're in on the human smuggling, they're in on the illegal aliens who they keep as a slave class under them, who they make sign up for welfare, who they then skim off of and make the illegals work three jobs.
[00:21:00.421 --> 00:21:02.642]  They're knowingly all in on the plan.
[00:21:02.682 --> 00:21:06.963]  You have to understand, they are in on the plan, even down to low level.
[00:21:07.762 --> 00:21:08.162]  Leftist.
[00:21:08.763 --> 00:21:09.783]  Low-level antifa.
[00:21:10.263 --> 00:21:11.484]  Children of professors.
[00:21:11.624 --> 00:21:12.625]  Children of government workers.
[00:21:12.965 --> 00:21:14.606]  Children of Time Warner executives.
[00:21:14.626 --> 00:21:16.467]  I mean, we've infiltrated their groups in Austin.
[00:21:17.127 --> 00:21:18.728]  They're not even communists.
[00:21:18.808 --> 00:21:24.191]  They are satanists who are into pure evil and wanting to hurt people and loving the evil plan.
[00:21:24.432 --> 00:21:27.233]  And they're actually following the directives of Mao Zedong.
[00:21:27.793 --> 00:21:31.856]  Now, I've told you that a lot, but it's in mainstream news today, even on London Guardian.
[00:21:33.711 --> 00:21:41.554]  But they're saying it's a good thing that Xi Jinping is a neo-Maoist and is actually realizing the dream of Mao and David Rockefeller.
[00:21:46.256 --> 00:21:47.217]  So that's all coming up.
[00:21:47.857 --> 00:21:50.498]  But you really need to understand what's happening in the full evil.
[00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:53.459]  Even down to low-level Democrats.
[00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:55.380]  That's why they're so evil, why they're so hateful.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.062]  They've been led on the plan, they've accepted the plan, and they believe they're going to rule.
[00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:08.289]  Because our elite opened the drawbridge for the CHICOMS.
[00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:14.571]  The country's 99% gone, but 1% can turn it around any time we want.
[00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:17.973]  1% started the Revolutionary War, 3% won it.
[00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:20.554]  It's always been that way.
[00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:24.536]  And we're going to defeat the CHICOMS and the Democratic operatives.
[00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:33.940]  But you wonder why they fight so hard, why they're so vicious, why they're so hateful, why we can't... Because they're criminals, whose back's against the wall, and who are gonna go all out
[00:22:36.135 --> 00:22:37.916]  But these are enemy combatants.
[00:22:39.237 --> 00:22:39.837]  Feinstein.
[00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:42.439]  Schiff.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.240]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.842]  These are actual enemies of the country.
[00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:54.507]  Consciously, under the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Endowment, their entire adult lives, they have been on the enemy team.
[00:22:54.667 --> 00:22:57.329]  They're not traitors, they're enemy generals.
[00:22:58.348 --> 00:22:59.069]  You understand that.
[00:22:59.089 --> 00:23:00.410]  We'll be right back with the big news.
[00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.611]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:02.992]  This is the Infowar.
[00:23:03.212 --> 00:23:07.315]  Tell everyone we're live and the American resistance is on fire!
[00:23:09.516 --> 00:23:11.118]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:23:11.158 --> 00:23:12.279]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:23:12.439 --> 00:23:16.141]  And President Trump has come out and called for China to investigate Biden.
[00:23:16.262 --> 00:23:17.983]  No, that's not what he did.
[00:23:18.984 --> 00:23:23.307]  But it's the controlled corporate media to take something and completely turn it around into something different.
[00:23:24.684 --> 00:23:32.208]  It was a giant threat in the announcement that he's going after them for their sellout of America to the Chai comms.
[00:23:32.228 --> 00:23:34.890]  I'm going to be covering that here in just one moment.
[00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:40.353]  And this China file worship of the CFR and the media.
[00:23:40.373 --> 00:23:49.379]  I mean, you could show all the articles, how many senators it turns out have top Chinese spies running their offices, chiefs of staff, their valets, their drivers, their maids.
[00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:51.760]  I mean, they're managing their investment.
[00:23:52.415 --> 00:23:57.457]  You put our people in your home, or you'll not get the money through our front company.
[00:23:57.477 --> 00:23:59.677]  We own you, bitch!
[00:24:00.978 --> 00:24:04.399]  That is all actually admitted about Feinstein and all these people.
[00:24:04.979 --> 00:24:09.141]  She's gotten billions, her and her husband, billions, through the Chai Com front companies.
[00:24:09.301 --> 00:24:11.621]  Billions, billions, billions, billions.
[00:24:11.921 --> 00:24:13.082]  The word is it's about $2 billion.
[00:24:15.247 --> 00:24:17.148]  That's why the Washington Post tries to normalize it.
[00:24:17.429 --> 00:24:20.271]  Oh, Xi Jinping, destroy Trump for us.
[00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:23.573]  Oh, the CFR, Davos, worshiping him.
[00:24:26.636 --> 00:24:27.736]  China's infiltration of U.S.
[00:24:27.797 --> 00:24:30.779]  capital markets is a national security concern.
[00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:31.519]  Washington Post.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.464]  You didn't learn any of this until Trump got in because this is a secret Pearl Harbor.
[00:24:39.325 --> 00:24:39.946]  To the next level.
[00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:41.127]  I'm going to get to it in a moment.
[00:24:42.578 --> 00:24:49.483]  And you notice, I've been harping on this for really 20 plus years, and it was a big attack from the left and a big attack from the right.
[00:24:49.543 --> 00:24:51.765]  Jones makes up this China clash.
[00:24:52.045 --> 00:24:54.006]  It's crazy, because that's never in our news.
[00:24:54.587 --> 00:25:02.652]  But if you read what the Trilateral Commission was saying, or you read the CFR, or you read the Brookings Institute, I mean, it was all America's done, the whole plan.
[00:25:02.892 --> 00:25:08.036]  They're going to turn our coal plants off, and China can build dozens a week, literally.
[00:25:10.267 --> 00:25:13.809]  Their energy is three times cheaper, all of this to destroy us!
[00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:16.470]  And of course, I've been totally vindicated.
[00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.311]  But it's not about me being vindicated.
[00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:21.152]  I would have rather had people listen 20 years ago.
[00:25:24.074 --> 00:25:29.697]  But see, people say, well China, how'd they do this from, again, 50, 60 years ago, 90% of them didn't have electricity.
[00:25:30.674 --> 00:25:32.055]  They didn't have indoor toilets.
[00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:36.097]  Still a lot of Chinese homes and places don't even have indoor toilets.
[00:25:36.597 --> 00:25:37.758]  Nothing wrong with that, I'm just saying.
[00:25:38.358 --> 00:25:42.840]  How do they now have enough ICBMs to blow up every town and city in America over and over again?
[00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.682]  Because this is the robber baron's revenge 120 years ago.
[00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:54.846]  They were talking about leveraging China out to take down the U.S.
[00:25:54.866 --> 00:25:55.606]  100 plus years ago.
[00:25:57.827 --> 00:25:58.628]  And they finally did it.
[00:26:00.213 --> 00:26:01.443]  I'm gonna get to that in a moment, but first...
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.681]  Listen, we've got the biggest sale we've done since Christmas.
[00:26:05.801 --> 00:26:09.662]  It's got to end this weekend because a lot of products are very close to selling out.
[00:26:09.702 --> 00:26:15.283]  In fact, some of the items have had to be taken off because every supplement more than 60 were 50% off.
[00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:18.284]  Now it's like 55 because five have sold out.
[00:26:18.984 --> 00:26:20.945]  DNA Force has already been sold out before this sale.
[00:26:20.965 --> 00:26:22.105]  People are chomping at the bit for that.
[00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:22.986]  It's such a great formula.
[00:26:23.026 --> 00:26:27.227]  PQQ, CoQ10 and other key enzymes, amino acids for better upload of it.
[00:26:27.527 --> 00:26:28.427]  People get an amazing response.
[00:26:28.447 --> 00:26:29.708]  That should be back in a few weeks, folks.
[00:26:30.528 --> 00:26:31.048]  But we've got
[00:26:32.998 --> 00:26:37.719]  55 items at 50% off that are in the quote supplement genre.
[00:26:38.379 --> 00:26:41.960]  I mean, we call the caffeine, the high quality coffee, a supplement.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.460]  It's not.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:42.961]  It's a food.
[00:26:42.981 --> 00:26:44.761]  It's an herb.
[00:26:45.801 --> 00:26:47.121]  It's from other nature.
[00:26:47.181 --> 00:26:47.742]  It's incredible.
[00:26:47.782 --> 00:26:48.062]  It works.
[00:26:48.422 --> 00:26:50.142]  It's like me saying, oh, plants don't work.
[00:26:50.182 --> 00:26:50.922]  They're a scam.
[00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:51.382]  Oh, yeah.
[00:26:51.903 --> 00:26:52.723]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:26:53.123 --> 00:26:55.383]  Like aspirin and coffee and marijuana.
[00:26:55.403 --> 00:26:56.364]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[00:26:56.404 --> 00:27:01.885]  The medicine cabinet is what the drug companies try to copy so they can own it and patent it and control it.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.822]  But it's the final days of the Black Friday mega sale that came two months early.
[00:27:08.823 --> 00:27:20.529]  Storewide free shipping, double paid reappointment, 50% off all the supplements and the huge list of preparedness items from emergency radios to shortwave radios to all the high quality water filtration, air filtration, storable food.
[00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:21.410]  It's all excellent.
[00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.932]  And things like protein bars.
[00:27:25.731 --> 00:27:32.015]  We went out to the top companies and said, what is the very best protein bar that has the most great ingredients and tastes great?
[00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:33.736]  And they said, here is the protein bars.
[00:27:34.556 --> 00:27:35.797]  I said, I want it even stronger.
[00:27:35.857 --> 00:27:36.477]  I want it even better.
[00:27:36.497 --> 00:27:37.258]  I want no fillers.
[00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:45.322]  And quite frankly, our two types of protein bars are so good though, but it takes like 20 minutes to eat them instead of two minutes because there's no filler.
[00:27:46.243 --> 00:27:48.664]  It's like coffee, but it's really good.
[00:27:48.784 --> 00:27:49.905]  But people love them.
[00:27:51.343 --> 00:27:56.546]  I'm almost tempted to come out with one that has a little bit of filler, because for me, it's like, I guess I was used to fillers, but people like it.
[00:27:57.106 --> 00:27:58.347]  It's just, it's just almost too much.
[00:27:58.407 --> 00:27:59.147]  It tastes great, though.
[00:28:00.768 --> 00:28:03.370]  Well, there are bars that are six or seven dollars apiece.
[00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.990]  These are normally three dollars apiece.
[00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:06.371]  On sale, they're even less.
[00:28:07.272 --> 00:28:12.775]  We're barely making, I don't know, 50 cents a bar at this price, but they've been a big seller.
[00:28:12.835 --> 00:28:19.578]  They're still 50% off the vanilla and the, of course, there's the vanilla and coconut,
[00:28:21.261 --> 00:28:22.901]  Other one that is the chocolate and the peanut butter.
[00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:26.162]  And that's free shipping and double Patriot points as well.
[00:28:26.282 --> 00:28:27.002]  Can't beat that.
[00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:29.643]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality B12 you're gonna find.
[00:28:29.923 --> 00:28:32.343]  It's 50% off with free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order.

[00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:40.805]  That is basically at cost.
[00:28:40.825 --> 00:28:43.166]  I told them when they did it, I said, that's not supposed to be on there.
[00:28:43.985 --> 00:28:44.965]  Because that's at cost.
[00:28:45.005 --> 00:28:45.526]  What have you done?
[00:28:45.606 --> 00:28:46.186]  But it's there.
[00:28:46.206 --> 00:28:50.527]  50% off Super Male Vitality with free shipping and double Patriot Points.
[00:28:50.567 --> 00:28:51.207]  That's incredible.

[00:29:02.892 --> 00:29:04.232]  Bio-True Selenium is amazing.
[00:29:05.292 --> 00:29:07.513]  You talk about boosting your hormones, your whole body, everything.
[00:29:07.533 --> 00:29:09.414]  Just be careful, because this is real selenium.
[00:29:09.434 --> 00:29:10.254]  This isn't synthetic.
[00:29:10.274 --> 00:29:11.454]  It's from the mustard seed.
[00:29:11.755 --> 00:29:12.715]  So, just be careful.
[00:29:14.778 --> 00:29:16.700]  50% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.082]  50% off Chill Force, which is our amazing new product with free shipping and double Patriot points.

[00:29:25.745 --> 00:29:26.666]  That's very close to cost.
[00:29:27.467 --> 00:29:29.288]  And there's just a bunch of other great items.
[00:29:29.408 --> 00:29:32.070]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.392]  And one other product that's brand new that is 50% off as well.
[00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:47.439]  You've seen all the big national ads for beets.
[00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.100]  The powder of beets.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.640]  And doctors recommending it.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.741]  And those are great, and you should get them.
[00:29:55.381 --> 00:29:56.681]  You see the ads on Fox News.
[00:29:57.581 --> 00:30:03.163]  I went to, again, we always go to two, three, or four of the top manufacturers in the country that do private labeling.
[00:30:03.663 --> 00:30:05.403]  And we say, uh, you got any beet products?
[00:30:05.423 --> 00:30:06.624]  And they go, do we have beet products?
[00:30:06.744 --> 00:30:07.784]  And we make like ten of them.
[00:30:07.844 --> 00:30:08.604]  We make six of them.
[00:30:08.624 --> 00:30:09.364]  We make five of them.
[00:30:09.764 --> 00:30:10.785]  Would you like a private label one?
[00:30:10.805 --> 00:30:12.245]  And I said, uh, what's your best?
[00:30:13.695 --> 00:30:14.775]  They go, well, it's this one or it's that one.
[00:30:14.795 --> 00:30:16.996]  I said, well, what about something even stronger?
[00:30:17.016 --> 00:30:18.437]  Like, if you're gonna make something even better?
[00:30:18.957 --> 00:30:21.338]  Because I'm like, what's in this best-selling brand everybody's buying?
[00:30:21.858 --> 00:30:24.319]  Well, there's $2 a product, but it still works really great.
[00:30:24.559 --> 00:30:27.180]  You sell it for 40 bucks, you gotta, you know, 10 times markup.
[00:30:28.641 --> 00:30:29.801]  I go, no, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:34.983]  What if I put $9 in it and mark it up three times to fund myself?
[00:30:37.744 --> 00:30:39.685]  So we have a super concentrated,
[00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:50.544]  That doesn't just have all the vitamins and minerals that are known in beets, it has all these cofactors and things that really, it's hard to measure, but it's known for heart, it's known for the vascular system, it's great for the brain, it's great for the liver.
[00:30:51.504 --> 00:31:06.051]  Vizobeets Complete is concentrated essence of beets that's been cold processed so that you get the transference of whatever that little ring structures, cofactors, whatever it is in a natural cold press that makes it so much stronger.
[00:31:07.988 --> 00:31:10.169]  It's $19.95 right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:11.290]  That's a great deal.
[00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:15.672]  Products are out there that are $40, $50 that aren't as good.
[00:31:15.692 --> 00:31:18.554]  This goes under the tongue, so you get better absorption.
[00:31:18.574 --> 00:31:19.194]  Put it under the tongue.
[00:31:19.614 --> 00:31:22.416]  Hold it for a minute or two if you want to get the full effect.
[00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:27.472]  I get lazy after like five seconds and just slurp it down and then take, you know, three squirts in the mouth instead of one.
[00:31:28.012 --> 00:31:37.480]  What's more economical and works just as good, because most of it doesn't get absorbed in your gut, is through the blood vessels in the mouth, hold it there for a minute, and this will last you months, you'll get a great effect.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.162]  If you're like me, I just go squirt, squirt, squirt, because I'm too lazy to do it.
[00:31:41.183 --> 00:31:48.329]  But again, Vizobeats Complete, InfoWareStore.com, super high quality, we're very, very proud of it, and it funds our operation.
[00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:50.291]  So, thank you all for your support.
[00:31:51.874 --> 00:31:53.479]  I want to be able to expand in 2020.
[00:31:54.001 --> 00:31:57.953]  If we don't get massive funding, we'll have to contract or implode.
[00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:01.500]  After the election.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:09.486]  I mean, we can keep going until then, but we're spending all our back-up money, and I'm just doing everything I can, so I appreciate your support, but these are things you already need.
[00:32:09.686 --> 00:32:22.176]  Get your coffee, get your fluoride-free toothpaste, 4 to 5 of chlorosilver iodine, get your X2, get it all at InfoWarsTore.com, and support the broadcast, and also support our local AM and FM affiliates, and TV affiliates, however you can as well.
[00:32:22.616 --> 00:32:23.437]  Tithe to them!
[00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:26.839]  I mean, if they're telling the truth and having this show on, that's really important.
[00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:29.001]  We're doing more than these fake churches, I can tell you right now.
[00:32:31.732 --> 00:32:44.863]  At the start of the next hour, I'm going to show you a Communist Chinese book adopted as the doctrine more than 30 years ago by the Communist Chinese.
[00:32:46.144 --> 00:32:56.713]  And in the book is shipping heroin into the United States and of course now modern fentanyl 50 times stronger than heroin, 100 times stronger than morphine.
[00:33:00.287 --> 00:33:11.114]  Always hear different numbers, but I did some studying this morning and looked it up, and that's... Pure fentanyl might even be stronger than that, but... Let's just say it's... It'll kill you dead in a hammer, a microgram of it.
[00:33:11.134 --> 00:33:17.439]  And you have to understand, when you hear about, oh, 300 people got killed in mass shootings, oh, that's terrible!
[00:33:17.819 --> 00:33:20.901]  How about hundreds of thousands dying from the fentanyl?
[00:33:22.722 --> 00:33:29.247]  And if you see the old opium dens, people laying out on the streets in China on opium, shipped in by the British intelligence,
[00:33:30.421 --> 00:33:32.643]  That's what the homeless crisis, most of it's that.
[00:33:34.624 --> 00:33:36.425]  But America never shipped opium into China.
[00:33:37.886 --> 00:33:42.550]  The globalists that set China up are doing it to us now to conquer us.
[00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.350]  You see how that works?
[00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.891]  The globalists run China.
[00:33:46.833 --> 00:33:47.393]  Isn't that sick?
[00:33:48.154 --> 00:33:50.515]  It's not the Chinese doing to us what we did to them.
[00:33:51.476 --> 00:33:55.259]  It's the British intel models, not the British people.
[00:33:56.078 --> 00:33:59.361]  This British Empire system, the Cecil Road system, this is all history, by the way.
[00:33:59.381 --> 00:34:00.022]  It's not debatable.
[00:34:00.462 --> 00:34:01.303]  I'm telling you what's admitted.
[00:34:03.465 --> 00:34:04.165]  To do this to us.
[00:34:04.205 --> 00:34:05.646]  So, here's the big news.
[00:34:05.726 --> 00:34:15.135]  President Trump, this morning, we'll play a clip, said, oh, you're asking me at press conferences about Biden.
[00:34:15.395 --> 00:34:22.081]  Was I trying to make Ukraine do my bidding?
[00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:26.802]  Or I'd hold back a billion dollars, quid pro quo.
[00:34:29.143 --> 00:34:30.823]  Because you know who I think I'll ask?
[00:34:31.564 --> 00:34:37.266]  I think I'll ask China to investigate the Bidens and what they did on trade deals.
[00:34:37.306 --> 00:34:42.588]  Because everybody knows Biden was the bag man for Obama and the Clintonistas and their foundation.
[00:34:42.928 --> 00:34:48.370]  And the amount of sellout under Obama was 50 times what happened under Clinton.
[00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:53.492]  Because the Clintons were still directing it, they could just get away with more in the
[00:34:56.156 --> 00:34:56.396]  2000s.
[00:34:57.918 --> 00:34:59.439]  Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:34:59.499 --> 00:35:00.520]  Just everything.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.462]  Huawei coming in, spying on everything.
[00:35:03.482 --> 00:35:05.844]  The Confucian Societies.
[00:35:07.325 --> 00:35:11.888]  It's confirmed, took control of every major public university.
[00:35:12.469 --> 00:35:13.549]  But they're Confucian clubs.
[00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.871]  UT got hundreds of millions a year from it.
[00:35:16.512 --> 00:35:19.774]  They just bought the chairs of most of the major departments.
[00:35:20.154 --> 00:35:23.477]  The science departments, the psychology departments, the defense departments.
[00:35:25.276 --> 00:35:26.977]  I mean, this is evil.
[00:35:27.297 --> 00:35:28.999]  But it's not the Chaikoms running us.
[00:35:29.059 --> 00:35:33.301]  It's the globalists put the Chaikoms in to then use them as the engine to destroy us.
[00:35:33.682 --> 00:35:36.864]  And so they can jump back and forth into their safe zone.
[00:35:37.044 --> 00:35:39.185]  Everybody always talks about people do corruption here and run to Israel.
[00:35:39.386 --> 00:35:39.746]  It's true.
[00:35:40.746 --> 00:35:43.208]  Or you can do corruption if you're in the Vatican, run back to the Vatican.
[00:35:44.129 --> 00:35:46.230]  That's child's play compared to China.
[00:35:47.291 --> 00:35:49.072]  And if Israel's doing bad stuff, get them too.
[00:35:49.392 --> 00:35:51.554]  I'm just saying it's a distraction from China.
[00:35:52.605 --> 00:35:53.345]  They own Hollywood.
[00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:54.026]  They own the dead.
[00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:56.907]  They're making their move, but with the globalists behind it.
[00:35:59.208 --> 00:36:01.609]  And if you read a communist Chinese party stuff, they admit all that.
[00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:09.533]  They go, oh, the Chinese communists go, oh, Rothschild, very smart.
[00:36:10.153 --> 00:36:10.813]  We pull this up.
[00:36:11.214 --> 00:36:16.096]  Well, they know how to do things in the communist speeches and before
[00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:24.138]  Xi Jinping got in, the guy before him would give speeches and say, China is the ultimate example of capitalism.
[00:36:25.118 --> 00:36:26.739]  Capitalism is communism.
[00:36:27.799 --> 00:36:28.719]  People go, that doesn't make sense.
[00:36:28.779 --> 00:36:29.360]  Oh yes it does.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:34.962]  Remember Obama before he left, went to Argentina and Chile and gave weird speeches to graduate classes of the politicos?
[00:36:37.423 --> 00:36:37.783]  And he said,
[00:36:39.244 --> 00:36:44.608]  What we need is communism in the countries, but outside it's free market, and then the two work together.
[00:36:45.089 --> 00:36:46.410]  And the students are going, what?
[00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.131]  He's explaining, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:49.052 --> 00:36:51.274]  And you'll be the management class, he's telling them.
[00:36:52.715 --> 00:37:02.763]  We'll have slaves outside, inside the countries, and then outside of that, you'll have the big multinationals above the law, tax exempt.
[00:37:04.205 --> 00:37:08.088]  So Trump is coming out, and Trump is saying,
[00:37:09.932 --> 00:37:19.337]  That, just like they did with the Biden thing, they come out, they bring out the Biden thing, everybody bites on it and then it blows up in their face.
[00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:23.959]  Well, now he comes out and says, oh, maybe China needs to look into the Bidens.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.320]  He's doing it publicly.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.000]  It's not illegal.
[00:37:26.381 --> 00:37:27.301]  He's being sarcastic.
[00:37:27.741 --> 00:37:30.503]  He's dropping the hammer and letting him know he knows where the bodies are buried.
[00:37:30.783 --> 00:37:34.565]  The billions, the Clinton Foundation, the billions of the Obamas, the billions of the Bidens.
[00:37:36.146 --> 00:37:38.207]  Over a billion into different Biden companies.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.964]  I mean, the Bidens and all these people have giant slush funds.
[00:37:44.484 --> 00:37:48.128]  So the media's going with the headline that Trump recruits China.
[00:37:48.148 --> 00:37:54.253]  And it's like, whoa, he's telling them to give him dirt on Ukraine or whatever.
[00:37:55.154 --> 00:37:59.158]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's about China.
[00:37:59.198 --> 00:38:05.624]  He's telling China, I know who your agents are, I know who your operatives are, and I'll bring out the 80 trillion pound gorilla.
[00:38:06.533 --> 00:38:07.134]  In the living room.
[00:38:07.714 --> 00:38:10.296]  I'll bring it out and I'll have it sit on top of you.
[00:38:12.158 --> 00:38:15.360]  If you want to keep playing games with your operatives inside the U.S.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.661]  because that's who America's fighting.
[00:38:18.503 --> 00:38:26.329]  It's the traitors within, allied with radical Islam, with the leftist globalists, with the Jesuits that have taken over the Catholic Church and want world government, end of the family, everything.
[00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:33.935]  The Jesuits suing me right now out of Georgetown for exposing Soros' involvement in the riot in Charlottesville.
[00:38:35.316 --> 00:38:36.416]  It'll all come out, they'll be defeated.
[00:38:37.336 --> 00:38:41.157]  But it's a combine of the Jesuits, the Chai-coms.
[00:38:42.137 --> 00:38:44.118]  Those Jesuits were the first to ever get into China.
[00:38:44.918 --> 00:38:45.338]  And Japan.
[00:38:47.178 --> 00:38:56.700]  The Jesuits, the Chai-coms, radical Islam, the Hollywood leftists that hate America, the EU, globalist trash.
[00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:58.881]  It's just a collection of evil.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:08.963]  I mean, you hear this Pope, he comes out and says stuff that is 180 degrees from what Pope John Paul II said, or the Bible says.
[00:39:10.124 --> 00:39:11.345]  It's just pure evil.
[00:39:11.425 --> 00:39:12.325]  It's all out in the open.
[00:39:12.365 --> 00:39:12.885]  It's everywhere.
[00:39:14.446 --> 00:39:24.811]  And so, President Trump is laying it all out and saying, we're not going to wreck the West, we're not going to bankrupt America, we're not going to have one-sided trade deals.
[00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:27.933]  Benjamin Netanyahu did the same thing, allied with Trump.
[00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:30.414]  Rothschilds are removing him right now.
[00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:33.527]  And that's officially the Rothschilds saying they're doing it.
[00:39:33.687 --> 00:39:34.628]  They own the Economist.
[00:39:34.888 --> 00:39:36.829]  They've said for a year, we're going to remove BB.
[00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.570]  They do it.
[00:39:38.991 --> 00:39:43.635]  And then all the Israel haters aren't even sophisticated enough to know there's different factions in Israel.
[00:39:44.235 --> 00:39:45.576]  It's just, it's just insane.
[00:39:46.637 --> 00:39:48.158]  America is fighting for its life.
[00:39:48.538 --> 00:39:53.002]  Israel knows there's a plan to detonate the New World War by destroying Israel.
[00:39:53.202 --> 00:39:56.805]  This is all biblical stuff, folks, and we better be on the right side of it.
[00:39:58.695 --> 00:40:00.076]  There's corruption in every government.
[00:40:00.096 --> 00:40:01.076]  There's problems everywhere.
[00:40:01.456 --> 00:40:07.519]  But there's a plan to remove the West and wealth and freedom because you can't have America and the rest of the world free.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.441]  You can't have the rest of the free world free.
[00:40:12.501 --> 00:40:18.164]  A few countries like Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., a few areas in Europe, the U.K., and everybody else be slaves.
[00:40:21.305 --> 00:40:25.327]  And so that's really the question, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:26.387 --> 00:40:27.768]  What type of world do we want to live in?
[00:40:28.763 --> 00:40:30.145]  Because America's got its problems.
[00:40:31.247 --> 00:40:34.612]  But there is a conscious move to bring us down and take us down.
[00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:38.779]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and play the president throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:40:41.078 --> 00:40:46.780]  Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.721]  It's a very simple answer.
[00:40:49.801 --> 00:41:08.066]  They should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that's newly formed and all these companies, if you look at, and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with
[00:41:09.405 --> 00:41:10.585]  Uh, with Ukraine.
[00:41:11.286 --> 00:41:19.668]  So I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.
[00:41:21.188 --> 00:41:24.069]  Now, that's what a president should do.
[00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:26.410]  They're gonna claim, oh, that's your political rival, you can't do that.
[00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:27.070]  Bull!
[00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.511]  The Democrats all went and made up that fake dossier on Trump.
[00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:35.032]  Now they've made up this new one, and a lot of smart people now believe that
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.761]  Schiff is a Jussie Smollett.
[00:41:41.341 --> 00:41:43.502]  And I was saying that yesterday privately.
[00:41:43.622 --> 00:41:45.682]  So was Mike Adams, a smart guy.
[00:41:45.763 --> 00:41:47.103]  I made some phone calls last night.
[00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:51.064]  I didn't see Don Trump Jr.
[00:41:51.184 --> 00:41:51.984]  on Fox Business.
[00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:58.386]  And I didn't know that he was saying that Adam Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, is the new Jussie Smollett.
[00:42:00.587 --> 00:42:01.607]  But that's what we're all saying.
[00:42:01.647 --> 00:42:04.528]  And the word is that that's why they'll never bring forward the whistleblower.
[00:42:05.373 --> 00:42:05.493]  We're
[00:42:24.974 --> 00:42:26.355]  He said he never said he wore a wire.
[00:42:26.535 --> 00:42:28.697]  Now there's transcripts where he did bail people he wore a wire.
[00:42:28.937 --> 00:42:29.778]  He says it's a joke.
[00:42:29.998 --> 00:42:40.327]  Turns out it's not a joke and now the phone calls are coming out and the emails that he told not just Mueller but others that the boss doesn't know we're talking keep this secret.
[00:42:41.628 --> 00:42:49.534]  So there's just all sorts of criminal activity by a permanent bureaucracy that sold the country out that's total trash that thinks they're invincible and godlike.
[00:42:49.955 --> 00:42:50.135]  No!
[00:42:51.783 --> 00:42:53.083]  Like Johnny Cash comes.
[00:42:54.023 --> 00:42:55.464]  Like Johnny Cash says.
[00:42:56.244 --> 00:42:58.164]  Sooner or later, God's gonna cut you down.
[00:42:59.404 --> 00:43:01.625]  Alright, I really very rarely do this.
[00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:05.105]  In fact, I never air a special report twice in the same show.
[00:43:05.825 --> 00:43:08.206]  And I've got like 15 incredible special reports here.
[00:43:08.626 --> 00:43:10.426]  I've got massive breaking news.
[00:43:10.846 --> 00:43:13.587]  But I'm going to play this report again that I played at the start of the show.
[00:43:14.347 --> 00:43:15.487]  Because I didn't play all of it.
[00:43:15.507 --> 00:43:16.567]  I only played two minutes of it.
[00:43:16.587 --> 00:43:17.327]  I didn't finish it.
[00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:20.548]  And it tees up what I'm gonna cover next segment.
[00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.649]  So again, this is beyond critical.
[00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:30.173]  We're about to lay out here the admitted battle plan to take down the United States and knowing is half the battle.
[00:43:30.533 --> 00:43:31.514]  So that's next segment.
[00:43:32.094 --> 00:43:36.537]  Then I'm going to get into the amazing second press conference the president gave.
[00:43:36.557 --> 00:43:37.617]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:43:37.658 --> 00:43:44.682]  Mike Adams is coming back in to get into his analysis of how they're going to escalate this towards assassination and how we can stop that.
[00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:45.822]  This is not a drill.
[00:43:45.862 --> 00:43:46.603]  This is not a game.
[00:43:46.903 --> 00:43:47.843]  This is the real deal.
[00:43:47.883 --> 00:43:48.564]  But I want to air this.
[00:43:48.964 --> 00:43:52.046]  Chinese missiles can now annihilate America.
[00:43:53.274 --> 00:44:06.541]  While Congress engulfs itself in fantasy impeachment world, while the Squad, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and the media push racial guilt, totalitarianism, and division deeper into our culture, while the U.S.
[00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:13.064]  border remains open to enemy infiltration and our bureaucracies protecting that border are demonized,
[00:44:13.624 --> 00:44:15.447]  Close the camps now!
[00:44:16.027 --> 00:44:17.890]  Close the camps now!
[00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.270]  U.S.
[00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:26.081]  Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.
[00:44:26.561 --> 00:44:30.727]  The Texas Department of Public Safety has reported that border security agencies
[00:44:31.127 --> 00:44:31.507]  I don't know.
[00:44:50.959 --> 00:45:02.985]  and the US military focuses on politically correct diversity, the communist Chinese subtly announced that wiping democracies off the face of the earth is now a reality.
[00:45:03.225 --> 00:45:07.647]  During their 70th anniversary celebration of communist rule,
[00:45:07.867 --> 00:45:24.317]  President Xi spoke of how Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong had stood in the same spot 70 years ago and declared the founding of the People's Republic of China paving the way for the country to embark on the path of the great rejuvenation of China.
[00:45:24.637 --> 00:45:28.719]  Xi said, no power can shake the status of our great motherland.
[00:45:28.999 --> 00:45:33.222]  No force can stop the progress of the Chinese people in the nation.
[00:45:33.582 --> 00:45:48.150]  As a parade displayed the Dong Feng 41, a 7,672 mile per hour intercontinental ballistic missile that is said to have the furthest range of any nuclear missile and could reach the U.S.
[00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:49.451]  in 30 minutes.
[00:45:49.691 --> 00:45:55.795]  Tell us about this missile, why it's such a national security nightmare for our country.
[00:45:56.974 --> 00:46:05.424]  Well, it's the idea that they had 20 of these missiles, a very old-fashioned obsolete kind, for most of the last few decades.
[00:46:05.504 --> 00:46:07.187]  Now, suddenly, they've got 90.
[00:46:08.048 --> 00:46:12.573]  They're able to reach any target in America in 30 minutes or less.
[00:46:13.114 --> 00:46:15.036]  Each one can carry 10 H-bombs.
[00:46:16.678 --> 00:46:19.000]  That big round sort of nose cone you saw?
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:28.948]  The shape of that nose cone is that the 10 H-bombs can fit inside and each one be separately targeted against an American city or a small town or an Air Force base.
[00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:33.912]  A hypersonic weapons arms race is now in full swing as U.S.
[00:46:33.972 --> 00:46:42.980]  company Lockheed Martin is developing a tactical boost glide weapon for DARPA and a hypersonic conventional strike weapon for the Air Force.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.744]  Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are teaming up to build engines for hypersonic weapons.
[00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:57.611]  Raytheon is also working on defense capabilities against hypersonic weapons, while Russia is developing a hypersonic glide vehicle.
[00:46:57.912 --> 00:47:05.998]  But back here in cuckoo land, fools like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi weaken our defenses and set the U.S.
[00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:12.023]  on a course to submission to the communist infiltration of every aspect of our country.
[00:47:12.819 --> 00:47:16.761]  How do you envision working with this president on these key democratic agenda items?
[00:47:16.821 --> 00:47:23.926]  Lowering prescription drug costs, you know, ensuring tougher gun safety measures, as you're actively considering whether to remove him from office.
[00:47:23.946 --> 00:47:24.906]  That has to do with each other.
[00:47:25.286 --> 00:47:26.447]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:32.511]  So, the media's trying to spin it that Trump's sicking China on Biden.
[00:47:33.471 --> 00:47:36.713]  China owns the Bidens, owns the Clintons, owns the Obamas.
[00:47:37.413 --> 00:47:39.554]  They have bought off our politicians.
[00:47:39.594 --> 00:47:40.575]  Dianne Feinstein.
[00:47:41.075 --> 00:47:42.436]  It's all been in the news.
[00:47:42.456 --> 00:47:46.858]  The Washington Post calls for the Chinese dictator Xi Jinping to, quote, destroy Trump.
[00:47:47.218 --> 00:47:48.018]  That's their headline.
[00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:51.020]  They're like, ah, you'll never stop our commie dictator.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.321]  You think you're powerful?
[00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:53.801]  Bring forward our titan.
[00:47:54.101 --> 00:47:55.442]  He will defeat Godzilla.
[00:47:57.423 --> 00:47:59.664]  Literal three-headed dragon comes stomping up.
[00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:02.386]  One's got the head of Soros, the other is Xi Jinping.
[00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.632]  And the other of the New World Order.
[00:48:05.513 --> 00:48:05.773]  Sick.
[00:48:07.834 --> 00:48:08.875]  And there it is.
[00:48:08.895 --> 00:48:09.636]  Gee's Choice.
[00:48:09.656 --> 00:48:10.556]  Destroy Trump.
[00:48:11.077 --> 00:48:13.118]  Or save him and destroy America.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.901]  Isn't that just cutesy, cutesy, cutesy?
[00:48:18.742 --> 00:48:21.944]  You guys do a great job getting those articles pulled up lightning speed.
[00:48:22.565 --> 00:48:24.026]  Just wait a few more seconds.
[00:48:25.487 --> 00:48:27.829]  Then when the pop-up pops, you can kill the pop-up.
[00:48:28.229 --> 00:48:29.390]  And we don't always hit the pop-up.
[00:48:30.185 --> 00:48:31.286]  Which the crew's doing a great job.
[00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:32.507]  It's just that's the perennials.
[00:48:32.567 --> 00:48:34.369]  I've decided we're in direct live on air.
[00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:38.392]  Because that's what's cool about this broadcast is we're really live.
[00:48:39.253 --> 00:48:42.896]  This is really teleprompter free here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:43.597 --> 00:48:45.078]  And can we put the headline back up now?
[00:48:45.098 --> 00:48:45.799]  I want to show people.
[00:48:46.779 --> 00:48:48.261]  There is the Washington Post.
[00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:53.025]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[00:48:54.423 --> 00:49:01.489]  Isn't it good we have a Guardian that rounds up two million of his people right now in death camps and there's video of them being taken to executions?
[00:49:01.909 --> 00:49:03.771]  Oh, he's a good guy.
[00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:05.872]  He'll stop that Trump that puts kids in cages.
[00:49:05.953 --> 00:49:06.713]  Oh, that's not true.
[00:49:07.013 --> 00:49:12.198]  He'll stop that Trump that wanted a moat around America with alligators in it and crocodiles.
[00:49:12.578 --> 00:49:13.479]  None of that was true.
[00:49:13.519 --> 00:49:14.600]  We'll cover that next segment.
[00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:20.344]  Trump responded to that, but let's hit the big issue now.
[00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.187]  Trump has come out and said,
[00:49:24.445 --> 00:49:26.126]  Hey China, investigate Biden.
[00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:29.709]  He's saying to the Democrats, it's not illegal for me to expose your corruption.
[00:49:29.729 --> 00:49:31.270]  It's not a crime if I do that.
[00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:33.651]  You're not above the law, and I'm going to do more of it.
[00:49:34.632 --> 00:49:36.694]  I'm going to double and triple and quadruple down.
[00:49:36.914 --> 00:49:38.595]  Let's have a trial in the Senate.
[00:49:39.335 --> 00:49:44.859]  Let's bring it all out, because they will then take the bait and be destroyed.
[00:49:44.999 --> 00:49:46.901]  But still, this is an epic time to be alive.
[00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:51.024]  Trump is in a lot of danger, but he's very fatalistic.
[00:49:51.872 --> 00:49:53.412]  I told you this when he first got elected.
[00:49:53.512 --> 00:49:55.233]  Trump is very fatalistic.
[00:49:55.853 --> 00:49:57.673]  He's already predicted all of this.
[00:49:59.794 --> 00:50:03.395]  And I was not told to not say this on air.
[00:50:06.575 --> 00:50:09.096]  But I was told this by three people very close to Trump.
[00:50:10.776 --> 00:50:12.957]  And one of the people was drunk when they told me.
[00:50:15.097 --> 00:50:17.158]  And they said it in front of people.
[00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:21.947]  And that was the third time I'd heard those exact things.
[00:50:21.987 --> 00:50:23.167]  And I said, Trump told you that?
[00:50:24.368 --> 00:50:26.009]  And they said, you're damn right he did.
[00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.592]  And now, I know those three people heard this from Trump.
[00:50:31.012 --> 00:50:31.793]  He never said this to me.
[00:50:34.577 --> 00:50:35.557]  Because I've seen him do it.
[00:50:35.657 --> 00:50:37.318]  Trump says he's going to do this no matter what.
[00:50:37.518 --> 00:50:38.398]  He doesn't care if they kill him.
[00:50:38.718 --> 00:50:42.080]  He didn't want to die, but he's just in the groove, in the zone.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.520]  I mean, I'm in that same zone as well.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.561]  I just can't be as relaxed as Trump is.
[00:50:45.721 --> 00:50:49.082]  Poorly behind the scenes, he thumps over tables and screams at people and stuff.
[00:50:49.102 --> 00:50:52.443]  But, you know, when they make mistakes, really.
[00:50:53.343 --> 00:50:55.144]  And if you look at Trump, he doesn't make a lot of mistakes.
[00:50:55.184 --> 00:50:56.464]  They're always saying he's making mistakes.
[00:50:56.744 --> 00:51:01.586]  Now, he is Zen-focused, ladies and gentlemen, and I really admire it.
[00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:04.342]  Because he is the man in the arena.
[00:51:04.402 --> 00:51:08.325]  And all of you supporting Trump and supporting Infowars, you are men and women in the arena.
[00:51:08.345 --> 00:51:09.325]  In fact, you guys are awesome.
[00:51:09.345 --> 00:51:11.207]  Will you print me that man in the arena?
[00:51:11.587 --> 00:51:12.608]  I can't ever read that enough.
[00:51:12.808 --> 00:51:15.189]  But I said I'd get to the big news, so I'll do it.
[00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.733]  But let's play the clip of Trump right here, letting China know that he'll drop the hammer.
[00:51:19.753 --> 00:51:21.594]  And in fact, doing this, he just did drop the hammer.
[00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:28.673]  Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens.
[00:51:29.313 --> 00:51:31.614]  It's a very simple answer.
[00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:49.963]  They should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that's newly formed, and all these companies, if you look at — and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with
[00:51:51.296 --> 00:51:52.477]  Uh, with Ukraine.
[00:51:53.158 --> 00:52:01.605]  So I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.
[00:52:03.767 --> 00:52:04.568]  So, there you go.
[00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:09.612]  Trump in his inauguration on January 20th, 2017 said that the long
[00:52:18.354 --> 00:52:23.136]  Era of America surrendering to Communist China and others is over.
[00:52:24.316 --> 00:52:25.737]  Now that was rhetoric then.
[00:52:25.757 --> 00:52:31.699]  It was words, like saying, I'm gonna cut those trees down on the top of that hill and I'm gonna build a two-story log cabin.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.721]  And I'm gonna put a Red Rooster weather vane up on top of it.
[00:52:38.202 --> 00:52:42.143]  And I'm gonna smoke cigars and drink coffee and shoot deer off the front porch.
[00:52:43.604 --> 00:52:44.324]  At a thousand yards.
[00:52:46.087 --> 00:52:48.570]  You know, I've sat in a house like that and shot deer at 800 yards.
[00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:51.253]  That's where the fence line was, but a thousand sounds better.
[00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:52.935]  And you know what?
[00:52:53.035 --> 00:53:00.605]  Trump's now built the house, put up the rooster, smoking the cigar, drinking the coffee, and shooting the deer.
[00:53:01.707 --> 00:53:04.229]  I mean, he's deliberate on what he said he'd do.
[00:53:04.709 --> 00:53:06.070]  The era of surrender is over.
[00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.531]  Now, are we winning?
[00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.531]  Yeah, just barely.
[00:53:08.972 --> 00:53:12.474]  And that's my biggest frustration, is you'd think more people would get on board for this.
[00:53:13.355 --> 00:53:15.916]  I mean, it's for their own future and their own prosperity!
[00:53:16.717 --> 00:53:21.920]  But it's spiritual that they want to bring America down and they've sided with the evil.
[00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:27.824]  It's foolish, it's dumb, but they worship at the dark idol of raw power.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:30.881]  It's self-destructive.
[00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:36.125]  It's like people that hurt babies for no reason or guys that like to beat their wives up for no reason because they're punks.
[00:53:36.806 --> 00:53:37.706]  They don't have real power.
[00:53:39.628 --> 00:53:46.954]  People that get off on the evil of selling heroin to kids and then seeing their lives ruined and, you know, pimps dominating women and lording over people.
[00:53:47.014 --> 00:53:47.835]  It's disgusting.
[00:53:49.076 --> 00:53:52.517]  And it's good men not standing up for the innocents that allow this.
[00:53:52.837 --> 00:53:58.819]  Well, the era of surrender, the era of surrender is over.
[00:53:58.839 --> 00:54:04.420]  Oh, I feel so good not to surrender and just say, I don't know how this is going to end.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.302]  Like I told the Globals for 20 something years, but you picked this fight and you're looking for one and you got one now.
[00:54:11.742 --> 00:54:14.843]  You want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:25.096]  The era of America's long surrender is over.
[00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:30.917]  The end of World War II, we had all the power, all the money, all the inventions.
[00:54:31.437 --> 00:54:33.037]  We were the light of liberty worldwide.
[00:54:33.838 --> 00:54:36.338]  And then the big Robert Barron Foundations came in.
[00:54:36.358 --> 00:54:48.721]  They'd already been programming people with leftist ideology, where they'd tell all the college graduates, selling America out, breaking the family up, doing all this is to help the rest of the world so we don't become dominant fascists like the Germans.
[00:54:49.061 --> 00:54:50.461]  And so we're too good.
[00:54:50.882 --> 00:54:54.943]  And so it's the Christian thing to do, to basically cut your legs off.
[00:54:55.283 --> 00:54:56.763]  And let me tell you, that is taught at
[00:54:56.983 --> 00:55:03.665]  Major Christian universities that I don't even want to undermine, but I had family that went to them like Baylor.
[00:55:06.926 --> 00:55:07.826]  Both my grandmothers went there.
[00:55:11.247 --> 00:55:17.449]  And it is just all about having a guilt trip about yourself.
[00:55:17.969 --> 00:55:21.750]  That's where all the political correctness comes from is a sick, twisted form of Christianity.
[00:55:22.892 --> 00:55:34.136]  Where you don't believe in your providence, you don't believe in your birthright, you don't believe in your power over Satan through Christ, but where you just run around as a goody two-shoe, but are directed by the government, and it's a Christianoid leftist.
[00:55:34.176 --> 00:55:35.776]  And my grandmothers weren't leftists, they weren't bad.
[00:55:36.797 --> 00:55:42.478]  I have just experienced the superiority guilt that these people had.
[00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:44.059]  And they were smart.
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.841]  And they were accomplished.
[00:55:50.865 --> 00:55:52.525]  But they had a guilt.
[00:55:53.386 --> 00:55:56.886]  And there was a guilt that, oh, the men have got to be controlled a little bit.
[00:55:58.166 --> 00:55:59.847]  Because they might start another war.
[00:55:59.867 --> 00:56:01.627]  And that was taught to the women, you see.
[00:56:02.587 --> 00:56:04.048]  And that's the same thing the Romans would do.
[00:56:04.468 --> 00:56:11.569]  They would take over a village, they'd kill the leadership men, and they'd say, we're going to keep your boys alive, but you better make them domesticated or we'll kill them too.
[00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:15.010]  And the women, whether it was black slaves in the Caribbean,
[00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:20.873]  Or whether it was white Europeans as slaves for the Romans, that's the management system.
[00:56:21.234 --> 00:56:27.498]  And that's where the feminism comes from in all of it, is we're gonna take control of the men, we're gonna make them weak for their own good.
[00:56:28.959 --> 00:56:34.663]  But it's a bunch of men programming that to bring down your culture and society because they can't beat you.
[00:56:35.103 --> 00:56:36.424]  But if they can get mommy...
[00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:41.194]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:56:41.214 --> 00:56:44.256]  Of course, Hitler told the women, tell your sons to go out and kill.
[00:56:44.576 --> 00:56:45.617]  Tell your sons to die.
[00:56:45.697 --> 00:56:46.558]  Tell them never stop.
[00:56:46.598 --> 00:56:47.439]  Tell them they're invincible.
[00:56:47.999 --> 00:56:49.561]  Like the Spartan women told their children.
[00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:52.884]  Come home with your shields or on them.
[00:56:55.185 --> 00:56:56.767]  Come back dead or alive, but come back.
[00:56:57.648 --> 00:56:58.789]  Don't come back without your weapons.
[00:56:58.809 --> 00:57:01.651]  Don't drop your weapons and run, or we'll never talk to you again.
[00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:03.593]  Come home with
[00:57:04.977 --> 00:57:06.358]  Your shields are on them.
[00:57:06.378 --> 00:57:08.158]  Remember my mom told me that when I was a kid.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.441]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:57:16.102 --> 00:57:17.003]  Stealth war.
[00:57:18.843 --> 00:57:20.324]  Unconventional warfare.
[00:57:20.344 --> 00:57:28.288]  When we cover this news, the Pentagon would have you believe that China
[00:57:29.452 --> 00:57:32.574]  is the first country or nation to deploy things like this.
[00:57:33.254 --> 00:57:36.135]  Stealth war is as old as humanity.
[00:57:38.236 --> 00:57:39.537]  You knew somebody died of the plague?
[00:57:41.018 --> 00:57:52.443]  You would chop them up in pieces and throw them down the well so that it wouldn't be obvious right away that somebody with plague had been thrown into it.
[00:57:56.065 --> 00:57:58.346]  And then the people drinking the water would die.
[00:58:00.916 --> 00:58:02.238]  Poisoning is stealth war.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:08.990]  Surrounding somebody's castle and starving them out is the oldest form as well.
[00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.691]  Siege.
[00:58:09.891 --> 00:58:10.673]  They both go together.
[00:58:13.373 --> 00:58:18.875]  And so there's a technocracy above the United States and China that is all about stealth war.
[00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:26.857]  The vaccines, the fluoride, the glyphosate, all approved, all agreed on by the UN, just like the planetary spring.
[00:58:27.197 --> 00:58:28.378]  They have world treaties on that.
[00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:29.178]  Look them up, look up.
[00:58:29.678 --> 00:58:34.820]  Treaty from 79, the treaty from 94, for geoengineering.
[00:58:36.027 --> 00:58:37.888]  Which is not really geoengineering.
[00:58:37.908 --> 00:58:39.749]  They're poisoning you and the crops.
[00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:45.052]  But don't worry, Monsanto's got a seed that'll grow in the lead and in the aluminum.
[00:58:48.514 --> 00:58:54.497]  Yeah, they're more sophisticated than they were in the 60s when they would, you know, fly over Guatemala and release a million grasshoppers to eat the crops.
[00:58:55.558 --> 00:59:00.741]  Because a million would then replicate and lay eggs and you'd have a hundred million and then they'd replicate and you'd have
[00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:04.351]  A billion.
[00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:08.774]  Two billion grasshoppers in just a quick six months or so.
[00:59:10.294 --> 00:59:12.676]  Central America, they can basically breed year-round.
[00:59:12.696 --> 00:59:14.416]  A little side declassified issue.
[00:59:15.077 --> 00:59:18.298]  What I'm getting at is, oh, now they just spray everything with aluminum dioxide, barium, salt.
[00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:21.700]  And it's all public now.
[00:59:22.461 --> 00:59:24.842]  Obama went ahead and just doubled the spending on it.
[00:59:25.922 --> 00:59:29.405]  Department of Energy, and they had Brennan come out and admit it all, but I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:59:29.425 --> 00:59:50.025]  See, you start getting off into silent weapons for quiet wars and stealth war and all that, but the Chinese government has public policy going back, what is it, 29 years, 30 years, where they said, we will ship heroin into the United States, they're our strategic enemy.
[00:59:51.138 --> 01:00:01.205]  Because they'd been greenlit by the same globalists that ran the British Empire, that for 200 years had taken over China and broken it in 14, 15 different parts, depending on the time.
[01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:03.526]  You had the U.S.
[01:00:03.586 --> 01:00:11.091]  sector, the British sector, the French sector, the Austrian-Hungarian sector, the Russian sector, the Finnish sector, the Dutch sector.
[01:00:12.532 --> 01:00:14.493]  But the British Empire ran the sectors.
[01:00:14.513 --> 01:00:15.374]  They ran all the ports.
[01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:18.649]  They let different armies come in and run it all.
[01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:36.512]  The Chinese, for hundreds of years, because they made opium illegal, what was it, 300 and something years ago, they had an edict from the emperor that anyone caught with opium would be executed because it was being shipped in from India and Pakistan, but that was India then as well, and Kashmir.
[01:00:37.572 --> 01:00:38.933]  And the people didn't want to work anymore.
[01:00:38.953 --> 01:00:46.554]  They would just get enough money to get a little bit of opium and they would go lay on the side of the street and smoke it and then work enough until they ended up dying.
[01:00:47.827 --> 01:00:48.728]  We have opium dens now.
[01:00:48.768 --> 01:00:51.570]  They're all over the highways, all over the roads, in any leftist city.
[01:00:52.331 --> 01:01:00.798]  And then the Chi-Com triads ship it in, about 9% of the opioids now, and then the left fences it and makes the money, and then that's why they've got to have open-air places.
[01:01:00.818 --> 01:01:05.522]  The mayors passed the exact same laws, saying it, because they're getting their pockets lined.
[01:01:06.003 --> 01:01:08.325]  Oh yeah, these mayors all get cold hard cash.
[01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:10.687]  Now, let's continue here.
[01:01:11.915 --> 01:01:13.876]  And see, they repeat history because it worked so well.
[01:01:14.216 --> 01:01:17.398]  So the evil groups that ran the British did this to the Chinese.
[01:01:17.838 --> 01:01:19.959]  Now those same globalist groups put Mao Zedong on.
[01:01:20.419 --> 01:01:22.040]  He followed the one-child policy.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.501]  He followed all their secret testing, all the evil stuff they wanted.
[01:01:25.541 --> 01:01:26.762]  So they're globalist partners.
[01:01:27.102 --> 01:01:30.663]  And now they were maneuvered with Obama for our total destruction.
[01:01:30.704 --> 01:01:32.284]  But Trump got in last minute to stop that.
[01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:36.886]  At least partially.
[01:01:36.986 --> 01:01:38.447]  But you see all their operatives angry.
[01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:39.948]  So, deadly fentanyl.
[01:01:40.902 --> 01:01:44.304]  Brought home from China, being shipped through the mail, CBS News.
[01:01:44.944 --> 01:01:57.050]  And the government creates these huge factories, and they have the factory workers go home to their addresses, and then mail it through different systems to the United States, or to Mexico, or to Canada, and then it's mailed in here.
[01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:01.912]  And there's so much money they're buying off the postal services and the inspectors in many areas.
[01:02:03.573 --> 01:02:06.755]  And it's estimated thousands of tons are shipped in the U.S.
[01:02:06.795 --> 01:02:07.115]  alone.
[01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:08.756]  Now again,
[01:02:10.872 --> 01:02:13.633]  25 tons is enough to kill 10,606,000,000 people of pure fentanyl.
[01:02:13.653 --> 01:02:18.695]  People are gonna ask me, well, how do you do that?
[01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.656]  If it's enough to kill, you know, billions, how do you do it?
[01:02:21.636 --> 01:02:25.458]  Well, they're not taking it all at once, but it's still causing massive death right down to society.
[01:02:25.738 --> 01:02:30.920]  And instead of just shooting somebody and they die, they wound you with this and then it's a massive cost on society.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.261]  But don't just believe me.
[01:02:34.341 --> 01:02:35.641]  Here, Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[01:02:35.741 --> 01:02:36.862]  Deadly fentanyl brought
[01:02:38.047 --> 01:02:39.828]  Online from China being shipped through the mail.
[01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:44.171]  Fentanyl as a dark web profit center for Chinese labs to U.S.
[01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:44.971]  streets, NPR.
[01:02:45.852 --> 01:02:48.213]  China is using fentanyl chemical warfare against U.S.
[01:02:48.353 --> 01:02:49.514]  experts, say ZeroEdge.
[01:02:50.074 --> 01:02:50.274]  U.S.
[01:02:50.294 --> 01:02:52.856]  drug bust uncovers enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people.
[01:02:53.635 --> 01:02:57.338]  That was only 65 pounds to the translation over to the amount they caught in Mexico.
[01:02:57.358 --> 01:03:00.821]  10.6 billion plus.
[01:03:01.221 --> 01:03:01.721]  Fentanyl.
[01:03:02.122 --> 01:03:02.922]  It just goes on and on.
[01:03:03.583 --> 01:03:05.164]  How to win the U.S.
[01:03:05.244 --> 01:03:08.987]  trade war with China's broader stealth war on America.
[01:03:09.067 --> 01:03:09.948]  Robert Spalding.
[01:03:10.628 --> 01:03:15.172]  And they interview the former head of the Pentagon's Office on China, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:15.912]  It's an excellent interview.
[01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:16.473]  It's an hour long.
[01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:17.093]  You should go watch it.
[01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:18.575]  Now let's get to this.
[01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:20.775]  You can read it for free online.
[01:03:20.815 --> 01:03:21.936]  I've ordered the book itself.
[01:03:22.496 --> 01:03:23.917]  It's a reprint in the U.S.
[01:03:23.977 --> 01:03:24.517]  out of China.
[01:03:25.238 --> 01:03:26.539]  China doesn't deny this is their book.
[01:03:26.919 --> 01:03:32.943]  By Colonel Kuo-Liang and Colonel Wang Jingyu.
[01:03:32.963 --> 01:03:34.444]  If I'm pronouncing that probably wrong.
[01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:38.089]  Translated from the original People's Liberation Army documents.
[01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:39.691]  Unrestricted Warfare.
[01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:42.053]  Now I suggest you read this.
[01:03:42.113 --> 01:03:44.355]  It's only 100 pages or so.
[01:03:44.515 --> 01:03:50.460]  I got up again at 4.30 this morning and went online and found most of the book published and read it.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.160]  I've ordered the book.
[01:03:52.481 --> 01:03:53.502]  I suggest you go read it.
[01:03:53.943 --> 01:04:00.068]  Right in here they say, and this is from 30 years ago, we're going to ship massive amounts of heroin into the U.S.
[01:04:00.988 --> 01:04:02.650]  to weaken them and break down their society.
[01:04:03.922 --> 01:04:05.403]  Now, that's a fact.
[01:04:07.205 --> 01:04:20.837]  So, when your wife or your husband dies of fentanyl, I mean, I know four people well, and a lot of other folks a little bit, who died from fentanyl.
[01:04:22.038 --> 01:04:28.164]  I was on an airplane back from doing a podcast a few weeks ago, TI's podcast and others out in Los Angeles.
[01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:38.494]  I started talking about fentanyl to my security guy sitting next to me, and a bunch of people around me go, oh, hey, my mom just died of that.
[01:04:38.554 --> 01:04:47.397]  Hey, hey, my girlfriend wasn't even on fentanyl, but they laced it, the Chinese mafia, here in L.A., and the police were scared of them, and she died.
[01:04:48.538 --> 01:04:50.819]  They laced her marijuana vape.
[01:04:51.899 --> 01:04:53.160]  I don't know, I know all about it, sir.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.140]  I started talking to the guy.
[01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:03.553]  So, then I get off the airplane, somebody else walks up to me and says, oh my daughter just died of fentanyl.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:10.265]  I mean, I'm on an airplane and maybe only ten people can hear me, and three of them got dead dead people!
[01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:12.267]  This is a holocaust!
[01:05:12.627 --> 01:05:19.413]  But you're not gonna, you're gonna hear about a couple hundred killed in mass shootings, while millions are being put on the line, hundreds of thousands dying a year, and it's getting worse.
[01:05:19.653 --> 01:05:25.258]  We have opium dens, open air everywhere, and it's all the Chinese government with the filthy Democrat deep state.
[01:05:25.418 --> 01:05:28.301]  These people are enemy combatant murderer criminals!
[01:05:28.581 --> 01:05:31.583]  They're fluoridating you, they're murdering you, they hate you.
[01:05:31.824 --> 01:05:33.485]  China does not put fluoride in their water.
[01:05:33.825 --> 01:05:35.387]  Only enemies are hit with chemicals.
[01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:37.929]  Defending the republic.
[01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:50.539]  Why would communist China ship in thousands of tons of fentanyl a year and be allowed to do it under Obama, under Bush, and under the Clintons?
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:06:11.026]  Because George Herbert Walker Bush, former director of the CIA, Rockefeller anti-American globalist, son of the chief Nazi in North America, Prescott Bush, Democrat globalist, was the first U.S.
[01:06:11.106 --> 01:06:16.708]  ambassador to China and set up this whole agreement with Mao Zedong.
[01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:23.575]  And now you see the unrestricted warfare.
[01:06:25.136 --> 01:06:31.142]  You think George Herbert Walker just shipped in thousands of tons of cocaine to black neighborhoods?
[01:06:32.563 --> 01:06:34.745]  They shipped it into everybody's neighborhood.
[01:06:37.047 --> 01:06:42.272]  But when they got caught, they went, oh, we're just doing it to the black people, as if that matters.
[01:06:45.014 --> 01:06:47.917]  But it must have mattered to some of the old establishment in the Senate.
[01:06:49.821 --> 01:06:51.842]  And the Democrats, most of them former Klansmen.
[01:06:52.282 --> 01:06:52.702]  Seriously.
[01:06:54.403 --> 01:06:57.344]  Like when Tuskegee came out in 1979.
[01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:59.626]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[01:06:59.646 --> 01:07:02.547]  I think it was being done since the 30s and it came out in 1979.
[01:07:02.927 --> 01:07:03.647]  Tuskegee.
[01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:17.894]  Where, first they said a thousand, then ten thousand plus black people injected with live syphilis who then spread it to hundreds of thousands.
[01:07:21.523 --> 01:07:22.283]  Yeah.
[01:07:22.303 --> 01:07:24.385]  1932 to 1972, my memory served, but it came out.
[01:07:24.825 --> 01:07:28.128]  It broke, I want to say in 78 or 79.
[01:07:28.168 --> 01:07:28.869]  I've done research on it.
[01:07:28.889 --> 01:07:31.371]  The point is, just maybe I might show you here.
[01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:34.714]  I have them search what I say, because I want you to know I'm not making this stuff up, okay?
[01:07:35.034 --> 01:07:36.415]  I make mistakes here and there from my memory.
[01:07:36.435 --> 01:07:36.975]  It's not perfect.
[01:07:38.857 --> 01:07:40.678]  But, you know, going home and giving it to their wives.
[01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:44.742]  You go in, you think you're getting a vaccine or something because, you know, the doctor's going to help you.
[01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:45.683]  That's not what happens.
[01:07:47.295 --> 01:07:49.717]  They were doing it to white people all over the United States.
[01:07:49.837 --> 01:07:55.362]  Poor white people in the Bronx, poor white people in West Virginia, in the Appalachians, in Arkansas.
[01:07:55.762 --> 01:07:57.964]  They were doing it to poor white people in Northern California.
[01:07:58.264 --> 01:08:01.747]  They were doing it to poor white people in Illinois and Iowa and Michigan and Texas.
[01:08:01.987 --> 01:08:02.567]  It's all in there.
[01:08:03.868 --> 01:08:09.193]  But see, when they got caught, when the scientists came out and said, we're not doing this, they went, okay, say it's just the blacks.
[01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:14.117]  Because if people find out it's everybody, they'll go crazy.
[01:08:16.203 --> 01:08:19.726]  But if it's, oh, just those black people, then it's, so here's the moral of the story.
[01:08:20.226 --> 01:08:26.371]  To any racist out there, idiots out there, and I get tribalism, and I know other groups are racist.
[01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:28.432]  I know everybody is coming after white people.
[01:08:28.692 --> 01:08:32.735]  I get race is real when a mob of people of another color, you are coming to hurt you.
[01:08:33.216 --> 01:08:33.556]  I get it.
[01:08:35.558 --> 01:08:37.039]  I know black folks have been ganged up on.
[01:08:37.059 --> 01:08:37.839]  I know white folks have.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.460]  I know how gangs work, okay?
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.041]  I understand that.
[01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:41.942]  I'm not denying that we're tribal creatures.
[01:08:42.022 --> 01:08:43.904]  I'm saying it's manipulated against us.
[01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:56.242]  And it's manipulated to use our Christian ethos to not be tribal, so none of us have any tribal defenses, so the globalists can set up their own tribe and overtake us.
[01:08:56.582 --> 01:09:01.825]  So I'm saying tribalism is a survival instinct, and it's a good thing if you're conscious of it and use it wisely.
[01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:04.747]  Tribalism is to your family.
[01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.848]  Your number one tribalism is to your children, isn't it?
[01:09:07.568 --> 01:09:09.490]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, I love my wife a lot.
[01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.711]  And boy, I tell you, she's not street legal.
[01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:13.252]  If she was a car, she'd be a Ferrari.
[01:09:16.638 --> 01:09:19.580]  But I would cut her loose just like that for my kids.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.441]  And she'd do the same to me.
[01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:30.867]  There's just no doubt that my children, the daughter I have with her, that I am default programmed, that my life, her life, that those kids go first.
[01:09:31.247 --> 01:09:32.468]  Now that's a survival instinct.
[01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:38.931]  The fact they can get people to kill their kids and turn against that is what you call a great delusion.
[01:09:41.393 --> 01:09:42.053]  But I'm digressing.
[01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:50.357]  A lot of experts warn that the most deadly chemical weapon you could have now isn't even VX nerve gas.
[01:09:51.978 --> 01:09:52.658]  It's fentanyl.
[01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:55.760]  50 times stronger than heroin.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.941]  100 times stronger than opium.
[01:09:58.381 --> 01:10:02.003]  One microgram, one little grain up your nose, you're dead.
[01:10:05.885 --> 01:10:06.665]  You'll never know what hit you.
[01:10:09.346 --> 01:10:12.828]  That's why it got declassified in 2000 by the Federation of American Scientists.
[01:10:12.848 --> 01:10:14.849]  The Marine Corps asked for it to be reclassified.
[01:10:20.069 --> 01:10:24.791]  Under the Texas Sunshine Project, they discovered a Marine Corps plan under Bill Clinton.
[01:10:25.732 --> 01:10:28.033]  They even have the helicopters in underground bases.
[01:10:28.653 --> 01:10:31.035]  They're only, you know, 100 feet under or so, and it pops open.
[01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:38.498]  And a helicopter with weapons-grade heroin takes off, and they spray whole cities during riots.
[01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:43.241]  They found, though, that around 10% of people end up dying from falling and hitting their head or wrecking their cars.
[01:10:43.561 --> 01:10:47.103]  And then there's huge fires that come in some of the studies that were done.
[01:10:48.283 --> 01:10:49.664]  I'm just trying to give you an example of this.
[01:10:49.764 --> 01:10:57.691]  It's not just the Chinese doing this, but they have found that weaponized heroin is the best way to kill people.
[01:11:00.313 --> 01:11:00.894]  Or knock them out.
[01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:06.719]  So if a drone was sent over here with one pound of fentanyl,
[01:11:07.628 --> 01:11:15.893]  And let's say you detonated it over the Washington Monument on July 4th over a crowd of, say, 10,000 people.
[01:11:16.734 --> 01:11:19.635]  You could clearly probably kill most of those people.
[01:11:21.957 --> 01:11:24.178]  Now, if the Chinese did that, we'd go to war with them.
[01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:28.801]  Because it's a big open thing, a drone flies in, they did it, it's got their flag on it, they do it.
[01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:33.144]  But if they just ship it in by the thousands of tons,
[01:11:34.738 --> 01:11:37.259]  And it slowly kills it's cutesy kick, isn't it?
[01:11:37.999 --> 01:11:39.719]  And then we all get to make money off of it.
[01:11:39.739 --> 01:11:41.260]  The police make money off of it.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.740]  The jails get full.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.300]  You know, the drug rehab people make money.
[01:11:45.481 --> 01:11:46.821]  But the society's collapsing.
[01:11:48.681 --> 01:11:49.842]  And the cops don't want it.
[01:11:49.942 --> 01:11:50.582]  You don't want it.
[01:11:50.642 --> 01:11:51.222]  Nobody wants it.
[01:11:51.442 --> 01:11:52.942]  It's just kind of the system we're given.
[01:11:56.663 --> 01:11:59.184]  So see, we have to learn to get mad about this.
[01:11:59.224 --> 01:12:00.164]  But oh, let me explain something.
[01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:04.185]  You don't just think it's the CHICOM's green lit to ship
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.802]  Thousands of tons a year of fentanyl into the United States.
[01:12:09.863 --> 01:12:16.268]  They do that because any big facilities here in the U.S., most of the police aren't corrupt and most of the people aren't.
[01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:17.209]  They would blow the whistle.
[01:12:17.249 --> 01:12:19.090]  You wouldn't get away with doing it here.
[01:12:19.831 --> 01:12:24.594]  People turn a blind eye to liquor being made illegally or marijuana because people think, hey, it's like in the Godfather.
[01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:26.576]  Hey, you know, the church denies them.
[01:12:26.596 --> 01:12:27.897]  They're hookers and they're gambling.
[01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:29.518]  And they're liquor.
[01:12:30.119 --> 01:12:32.300]  So I've been involved in that, the Godfather says.
[01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:35.103]  But this drug business, I tell you,
[01:12:36.892 --> 01:12:38.913]  It's gonna bring down society and it's true.
[01:12:40.973 --> 01:12:44.694]  So people turn a blind eye in America to hookers and liquor and gambling.
[01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:48.456]  They're not gonna turn a blind eye to fentanyl.
[01:12:48.836 --> 01:12:59.039]  So they just produce it in China and then ship it in and then you got the big drug companies whose business plan is to get you addicted selling stuff not as strong but close.
[01:13:00.879 --> 01:13:01.259]  I mean what?
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.800]  Oxycontin's 10 times stronger than heroin?
[01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:05.861]  Fentanyl's 50?
[01:13:09.175 --> 01:13:12.516]  I mean, Rush Limbaugh went deaf on Oxycontin.
[01:13:12.816 --> 01:13:13.657]  It eats your nerves.
[01:13:15.897 --> 01:13:17.118]  Not judging Rush Limbaugh, by the way.
[01:13:17.158 --> 01:13:18.378]  I mean, he had a hurt back.
[01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:18.938]  He got addicted.
[01:13:18.998 --> 01:13:19.599]  It happens to people.
[01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:21.079]  It's very dangerous.
[01:13:21.119 --> 01:13:22.680]  We've all had monkeys on our backs.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.060]  Mine has been alcohol.
[01:13:24.921 --> 01:13:25.961]  I don't drink a drop.
[01:13:27.942 --> 01:13:28.662]  Joke around about it.
[01:13:28.782 --> 01:13:29.382]  Don't drink a drop.
[01:13:31.023 --> 01:13:31.643]  Some people can drink.
[01:13:32.003 --> 01:13:32.563]  It's good for you.
[01:13:32.663 --> 01:13:33.063]  Not for me.
[01:13:33.844 --> 01:13:35.044]  Because it just turns into a problem.
[01:13:36.325 --> 01:13:37.245]  All I'm telling you is...
[01:13:38.729 --> 01:13:40.710]  One drop of alcohol doesn't kill you.
[01:13:41.051 --> 01:13:41.851]  Fentanyl does.
[01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:42.992]  One grain of it.
[01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:45.934]  And Trump's trying to fight it.
[01:13:45.974 --> 01:13:47.495]  So how do you oppose somebody like that?
[01:13:47.815 --> 01:13:49.136]  Well, because you're making money off of it.
[01:13:52.078 --> 01:13:55.040]  And so, everybody just sits back, just that issue alone.
[01:13:56.621 --> 01:14:01.484]  But see, the very people that let China do that, that use China as the base to produce it safely and get it here,
[01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:09.071]  They're the same ones pushing the vaccines that hurt you and don't protect you by design.
[01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:10.071]  They're tainted by design.
[01:14:11.432 --> 01:14:14.533]  With all these allergen causing systems and all these cancer viruses.
[01:14:14.754 --> 01:14:21.497]  And they admit in medical journals that at current rates almost everyone will be so allergic that almost no food will be edible soon.
[01:14:23.536 --> 01:14:25.258]  The globalists can't take all the food away from us.
[01:14:25.679 --> 01:14:26.460]  We're too productive.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.821]  They want to starve us, they admit.
[01:14:27.961 --> 01:14:29.884]  So they just make it where you can't eat any food.
[01:14:30.224 --> 01:14:30.685]  Ha ha!
[01:14:30.765 --> 01:14:31.346]  See how that works?
[01:14:31.966 --> 01:14:38.154]  So you're being hit with the glyphosate, you're being hit with the vaccines, the fluoride to lower your IQ and lower your fertility.
[01:14:38.294 --> 01:14:39.075]  On record, they admit it.
[01:14:39.295 --> 01:14:42.860]  Again, this is in books written by Obama's science czar.
[01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:44.895]  Talk about a jerk.
[01:14:45.536 --> 01:14:48.877]  But again, he says we're doing this to sterilize you and make you dumb, more manageable.
[01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:51.638]  And then the guy that wrote Obamacare says, thank God you're so stupid.
[01:14:52.859 --> 01:14:53.619]  See how they rub it in?
[01:14:53.799 --> 01:14:55.180]  I don't like it being rubbed in.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.101]  And I don't want to take advantage of you and use you.
[01:14:57.121 --> 01:14:59.482]  See, there are a lot of smart people like me that know all this.
[01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:01.182]  They've just decided to join Satan.
[01:15:01.423 --> 01:15:01.923]  Well, guess what?
[01:15:01.963 --> 01:15:02.643]  They ain't that smart.
[01:15:02.783 --> 01:15:03.423]  I'm not doing it.
[01:15:03.704 --> 01:15:06.645]  Folks, we can beat these people, but we got to admit how bad it is.
[01:15:09.207 --> 01:15:13.351]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:16.374]  That is a 12-year-old liner.
[01:15:18.256 --> 01:15:20.238]  We loaded this song on the computer 12 years ago.
[01:15:20.258 --> 01:15:21.399]  I remember getting that liner cut.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:26.164]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Liberty.
[01:15:27.325 --> 01:15:27.885]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:15:37.543 --> 01:15:38.544]  And look how far we've come.
[01:15:39.224 --> 01:15:41.685]  But we have summoned the enemy.
[01:15:43.346 --> 01:15:46.408]  Newtonian physics for every action is an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:15:46.448 --> 01:15:47.089]  I've learned that.
[01:15:47.369 --> 01:15:47.829]  That's true.
[01:15:47.849 --> 01:15:48.769]  That's not just gravity.
[01:15:50.531 --> 01:15:51.731]  That's not just kinetic force.
[01:15:51.771 --> 01:15:54.013]  That's a spiritual law.
[01:15:56.914 --> 01:15:59.776]  And not following the laws God's laid down is sin.
[01:16:00.396 --> 01:16:04.979]  And God gives us free will and just says, hey, that won't go too well for you.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.100]  But I need other conscious beings.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.061]  It's kind of lonely.
[01:16:11.301 --> 01:16:15.983]  But I love you, and I really don't want to see you stick your hand in that garbage disposal.
[01:16:16.003 --> 01:16:19.443]  There's a little devil going, it's great in here.
[01:16:19.764 --> 01:16:20.524]  Don't let him lie to you.
[01:16:20.584 --> 01:16:21.344]  It's so much fun.
[01:16:21.364 --> 01:16:22.124]  Stick your hand in.
[01:16:25.005 --> 01:16:26.165]  That's really what it comes down to.
[01:16:29.646 --> 01:16:31.387]  I said I'd get to the parade.
[01:16:31.467 --> 01:16:32.527]  It's epic footage.
[01:16:34.448 --> 01:16:44.232]  And I've got all this other news and the second press conference you gave your stay and all the big developments and just stacks of incredible draconian censorship taking place, not just on the internet, but in the real world.
[01:16:48.233 --> 01:16:49.274]  And I want to take your calls.
[01:16:50.454 --> 01:16:51.754]  But I want to play this compilation.
[01:16:51.774 --> 01:17:00.878]  This is only a small spattering of the Democrats in the last few years and this week calling for Trump's imprisonment, his death after they get their impeachment through.
[01:17:02.238 --> 01:17:03.259]  The Democrats call for
[01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:08.027]  Impeachment, imprisonment, and the death of Donald Trump.
[01:17:08.047 --> 01:17:11.728]  He takes the risk of going to trial and he's convicted.
[01:17:12.088 --> 01:17:14.109]  That could be seen as an impeachable offense.
[01:17:14.249 --> 01:17:17.230]  I don't see how that wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
[01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:21.231]  That tweet fits the Republican definition of an impeachable offense.
[01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:23.432]  Where do you see an impeachable offense?
[01:17:23.492 --> 01:17:24.892]  It is grounds for impeachment.
[01:17:24.912 --> 01:17:27.273]  Potentially criminal or even impeachable.
[01:17:27.313 --> 01:17:28.133]  Grounds for impeachment.
[01:17:28.413 --> 01:17:32.415]  You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America.
[01:17:32.575 --> 01:17:34.456]  America will triumph over you.
[01:17:34.556 --> 01:17:37.097]  That apparently directed toward the President of the United States.
[01:17:37.617 --> 01:17:38.378]  Is it impeachable?
[01:17:39.618 --> 01:17:41.039]  100% is impeachable.
[01:17:41.119 --> 01:17:45.321]  Very substantial evidence that the President is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanor.
[01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:49.883]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[01:17:50.183 --> 01:17:52.686]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[01:17:52.866 --> 01:17:54.989]  There is enough here for articles of impeachment.
[01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.790]  Absolutely.
[01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:56.310]  Already.
[01:17:56.470 --> 01:18:02.998]  The president himself admitted that he had a telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine.
[01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:06.022]  He also said he did talk to him about Biden.
[01:18:06.562 --> 01:18:08.304]  With so many people knowing about this...
[01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:16.592]  It's interesting, and I'm kind of proud to say this, it took a member of the intelligence community to step up and bring it forward.
[01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:23.398]  It's hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the founders more than what's on that call.
[01:18:24.339 --> 01:18:27.701]  Where you have a president using the full power of his office
[01:18:28.596 --> 01:18:41.624]  To try to, uh, effectively coerce a foreign leader that is completely dependent on our country for military, economic, diplomatic... Hit pause and back this up to the other guy before... shift.
[01:18:42.644 --> 01:18:47.908]  These people are all so weak, so sycophantic, so... not even shallow.
[01:18:47.948 --> 01:18:49.408]  They're devoid of any substance.
[01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:56.913]  And they all just try to have these gleams in their eye that all they look like... is like...
[01:18:58.643 --> 01:19:00.623]  A crustacean, a crab or something.
[01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:17.406]  And then they talk about the intelligence community, oh, the secret guardians of the nation, when they're all a bunch of America-hating trash, trained and put into power because they were soulless, heartless, cowardly pieces of filth.
[01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.747]  And I don't say that with hate towards these people.
[01:19:23.848 --> 01:19:25.888]  I say it because they are a disease.
[01:19:27.543 --> 01:19:30.966]  And they know they don't have a soul.
[01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:34.290]  They know they don't have providence.
[01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:38.274]  I mean, you look at any of these guys, their families are trash, okay?
[01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:40.896]  I mean, they come from trash, they are trash.
[01:19:41.657 --> 01:19:46.982]  And you have to understand, because they come from trash, they want to hurt you because you're not trash.
[01:19:48.612 --> 01:19:52.015]  And you can be old, you can be young, you can be black, you can be white, you can be rich, you can be poor.
[01:19:52.536 --> 01:19:55.679]  If you care about God and you're a good person, you aren't trash.
[01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.260]  These people are trash.
[01:19:57.981 --> 01:19:59.122]  Let's go back to these trash.
[01:20:13.959 --> 01:20:23.042]  I'm kind of proud to say this, because you know, third world countries always get overthrown by their intelligence agencies and generals that put like 18 stars on their hats.
[01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:24.322]  I mean, you're a joke!
[01:20:25.263 --> 01:20:26.263]  You're a joke!
[01:20:28.263 --> 01:20:29.784]  An absolute joke!
[01:20:31.524 --> 01:20:33.585]  I mean, put that former CIA deputy director up.
[01:20:33.645 --> 01:20:37.546]  I mean, you know that guy gets hung up by his toes and beaten with bull whips and stuff.
[01:20:38.146 --> 01:20:39.287]  I mean, that's what that guy's into.
[01:20:40.345 --> 01:20:44.007]  And he's just a degenerate.
[01:20:44.407 --> 01:20:48.710]  You wouldn't let your kids get near him for a trillion dollars.
[01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:49.931]  Or Schipp.
[01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:51.031]  I mean, look at Schipp's eyes.
[01:20:51.331 --> 01:20:53.413]  If that isn't a pedophile's eyes, I don't know what are.
[01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:54.073]  I mean, I'll just tell you.
[01:20:54.533 --> 01:21:00.216]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile, but him and Brian Stelter, if I was a movie director making a movie about pedophiles that grab kids out of the back of...
[01:21:02.438 --> 01:21:03.799]  Backyards would take him to torture him to death?
[01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:12.343]  If I was gonna put a guy in red pajamas as the devil, torturing kids in a Satan movie, I mean, that's who'd be wearing the red pajamas, baby.
[01:21:13.223 --> 01:21:15.784]  Let's go back to this filth, this enemy of God.
[01:21:16.925 --> 01:21:17.505]  Go back to him.
[01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:28.907]  With so many people knowing about this, it's interesting and I'm kind of proud to say this, it took a member of the intelligence community to step up and bring it forward.
[01:21:29.048 --> 01:21:35.712]  It's hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the founders more than what's on that call.
[01:21:36.352 --> 01:21:36.492]  Ugh.
[01:21:36.512 --> 01:21:36.613]  Ugh.
[01:21:36.673 --> 01:21:36.733]  Ugh.
[01:21:55.733 --> 01:22:00.935]  Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S.
[01:22:00.995 --> 01:22:01.475]  election.
[01:22:01.955 --> 01:22:03.015]  It couldn't be clearer.
[01:22:03.075 --> 01:22:06.116]  And that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[01:22:06.716 --> 01:22:07.677]  That is treason.
[01:22:08.017 --> 01:22:09.577]  It's treason, pure and simple.
[01:22:09.737 --> 01:22:12.138]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S.
[01:22:12.198 --> 01:22:13.278]  Code is death.
[01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:14.659]  That's the only penalty.
[01:22:15.419 --> 01:22:18.082]  There's the governor, former governor of Massachusetts.
[01:22:18.582 --> 01:22:20.984]  Oh, you think Governor Weld's gonna kill anybody himself?
[01:22:21.104 --> 01:22:21.745]  No, no, no.
[01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:24.608]  Hey, Weld, you're not worth killing, son.
[01:22:25.068 --> 01:22:27.650]  So why don't you shut your mouth about killing people, okay?
[01:22:29.092 --> 01:22:31.053]  Just shut your mouth, you trash.
[01:22:31.514 --> 01:22:33.976]  You chi-com piece of filth.
[01:22:34.857 --> 01:22:35.678]  Sorry, go back to him.
[01:22:36.641 --> 01:22:40.903]  Pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S.
[01:22:40.983 --> 01:22:42.984]  election, it couldn't be clearer.
[01:22:43.044 --> 01:22:46.065]  And that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[01:22:46.706 --> 01:22:47.666]  That is treason.
[01:22:47.986 --> 01:22:49.587]  It's treason, pure and simple.
[01:22:50.747 --> 01:22:51.348]  Backing up again.
[01:22:51.368 --> 01:22:52.368]  Penalty for that's death.
[01:22:52.728 --> 01:22:56.130]  They're running around how they're going to kill everybody, how they're going to kill the president.
[01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.471]  And the president goes, hey, you're starting a civil war.
[01:22:59.071 --> 01:23:00.912]  Oh, you're mean!
[01:23:00.972 --> 01:23:04.974]  I mean, it's insane how they wage war on reality.
[01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:06.835]  And they want to start one!
[01:23:06.935 --> 01:23:07.556]  A race war!
[01:23:09.357 --> 01:23:12.420]  How about everybody not be stupid and not buy into that?
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:12.860]  Well, guess what?
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:13.841]  We haven't been buying into it.
[01:23:14.021 --> 01:23:15.243]  And that's why they're freaking out.
[01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:18.766]  And I'm telling you, they're winding up mass shooters of black churches to get it going.
[01:23:21.328 --> 01:23:23.910]  And they don't want me on air to question these things when they stage them.
[01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:25.051]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:23:25.412 --> 01:23:27.714]  Because they know you don't buy any of it either, do you?
[01:23:28.154 --> 01:23:29.976]  Even if some of these shootings are real, and some of them are.
[01:23:31.403 --> 01:23:32.384]  A lot of them are wound up nuts.
[01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:38.149]  They know and protect their own Prozac and all those drugs, or their Antifa, and admit they're doing it dozens of times and no one stops them.
[01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.910]  That's all confirmed.
[01:23:39.751 --> 01:23:42.053]  But sometimes they stage this stuff outright, and everybody knows that.
[01:23:42.454 --> 01:23:46.918]  And they're so pissed because you're not going to take the blame for what a psycho does.
[01:23:48.079 --> 01:23:49.781]  And they can't guilt you anymore.
[01:23:50.521 --> 01:23:53.884]  These fentanyl-pushing, abortion-pushing death-lovers.
[01:23:54.881 --> 01:24:00.804]  And oh, by the way, the videos are pouring in of people confronting Biden and Pocahontas and the Clintons.
[01:24:00.824 --> 01:24:02.365]  There's so many videos, I can't even get to it.
[01:24:02.665 --> 01:24:04.026]  Dude just showed me one earlier.
[01:24:04.066 --> 01:24:06.347]  He's got a 12-minute... It was 11.
[01:24:06.747 --> 01:24:07.528]  He had another minute.
[01:24:07.908 --> 01:24:15.192]  A 12-minute clip will try to air on The War Room or... They're in firepower tonight with Will Johnson and Papert.
[01:24:17.622 --> 01:24:20.205]  With all these new people going out and confronting.
[01:24:20.485 --> 01:24:21.626]  And they're going to Congress.
[01:24:22.327 --> 01:24:24.589]  People are going to Congress and they're confronting them in the halls.
[01:24:24.849 --> 01:24:25.630]  It's beautiful!
[01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:26.911]  It's happening!
[01:24:26.931 --> 01:24:31.215]  I didn't plug this out.
[01:24:31.235 --> 01:24:32.056]  I'm gonna plug just briefly.
[01:24:32.396 --> 01:24:33.898]  The big supercell's gotta end this weekend.
[01:24:34.755 --> 01:24:37.016]  We may still have a sale after that, but a lot of the stuff's selling out.
[01:24:37.136 --> 01:24:38.317]  Already five items have sold out.
[01:24:38.957 --> 01:24:45.020]  It's store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% off all the great supplements, and that means the protein bars, and that means the coffee.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.121]  I mean, just everything's massively discounted.
[01:24:47.201 --> 01:24:57.926]  And I get so busy, I just said 50% off, double Patriot points, store-wide free shipping, and they included the protein bars and the skin cream and the wound gel.
[01:24:58.366 --> 01:24:59.727]  That's at cost.
[01:24:59.807 --> 01:25:00.567]  I know what it cost us.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:11.164]  I mean, at 25% off the skin cream, we were making, like, $2 on the little tube and $5 on the big tube.
[01:25:11.204 --> 01:25:15.866]  I don't think we're actually making money on that, so buy something else while you're there, please.
[01:25:15.886 --> 01:25:17.547]  We got the best water filters, best air filters.
[01:25:17.567 --> 01:25:18.748]  They're all 50% off.
[01:25:18.828 --> 01:25:24.751]  It's a giant sale, so we got to sell a lot to fund ourselves, and I put myself in this discount trap, so please take advantage of it, folks.
[01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:27.872]  Whatever you do, spread the word, and please pray for us, because that's our shield.
[01:25:28.753 --> 01:25:30.694]  And I don't plan to be a goody two-shoes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:30.734 --> 01:25:31.674]  I just know I hate the devil.
[01:25:31.694 --> 01:25:32.235]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:35.737 --> 01:25:45.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a purge at Fox News and on Fox Radio and there's been a purge in Talk Radio and a purge on XM going on for about five, six years.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.802]  And they're just taking the shows off, big sponsorship comes in, demands conservatives be taken off the air.
[01:25:52.882 --> 01:25:55.142]  I've seen that done across the nation.
[01:25:56.943 --> 01:26:04.705]  And now, Fox News contributor has been taken off the air when he had a guest on saying that the Democrats' religion
[01:26:05.885 --> 01:26:08.866]  ...is Moloch worship in ancient Babylon and other areas.
[01:26:08.906 --> 01:26:11.507]  It was seen as a bull, also can be seen as an owl.
[01:26:11.847 --> 01:26:15.128]  They do a mock human sacrifice at Bohemian Grove to Moloch.
[01:26:15.988 --> 01:26:21.570]  And he was fired for having a guest on telling it like it is.
[01:26:22.090 --> 01:26:23.390]  This is a spiritual battle.
[01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:25.191]  The children are their sacrament.
[01:26:25.911 --> 01:26:29.632]  And they're trying to take Tucker Carlson and others off the air right now as well.
[01:26:31.457 --> 01:26:38.784]  It's clear to me that the average American citizen loves this president and they're not buying into all of this impeachment nonsense.
[01:26:39.505 --> 01:26:39.965]  They're not.
[01:26:40.065 --> 01:26:42.547]  And look, I heard it over and over again.
[01:26:42.888 --> 01:26:46.451]  Like you, I spoke to thousands of these people last week.
[01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:51.235]  And the reason they support this president is not because they're religious hypocrites.
[01:26:51.576 --> 01:26:53.638]  It's not because they think he is perfect.
[01:26:54.078 --> 01:26:57.101]  They know he's not perfect just like none of us is perfect.
[01:26:57.421 --> 01:27:01.465]  But they appreciate the strong Christian stance he takes.
[01:27:01.785 --> 01:27:10.012]  He is without doubt the most pro-life, pro-religious liberty, pro-Israel, pro-conservative judiciary president we have ever had.
[01:27:10.432 --> 01:27:18.539]  And they don't want to see this warrior, in a sense, removed from his place of leadership in our country.
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:24.905]  There is a fear that if the left ever regains control of this country again, our nation is finished.
[01:27:26.586 --> 01:27:28.588]  Look, I believe that.
[01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:43.984]  Based on some of the legislation they've been trying to shove down the throats of the good people of California, and then with this Equality Act that Nancy Pelosi and her cronies are after, I have no doubt that they want to especially go after and target Christians in America, Dr. Jeffers.
[01:27:44.564 --> 01:27:45.365]  Oh, I believe that.
[01:27:45.485 --> 01:27:50.969]  I believe if the left ever gets in control again, it's not going to be incremental change we see.
[01:27:51.429 --> 01:27:55.312]  They have said they're going to undo everything this president has done.
[01:27:55.733 --> 01:28:02.177]  And think about what he has done in the pro-life area, the sweeping religious liberty executive order he signed.
[01:28:02.458 --> 01:28:08.142]  They are going to undo that, and they are going to come after conservatives with a vengeance.
[01:28:08.602 --> 01:28:17.309]  I wonder if that's why we are seeing these unrelenting attacks on President Trump, more so than any other Republican in at least modern history.
[01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:19.171]  Yes, I think it is.
[01:28:19.331 --> 01:28:24.274]  And look, I said this on Fox & Friends yesterday and the President retweeted my comments last night.
[01:28:24.915 --> 01:28:29.358]  Look, the Democrats knew they couldn't beat him at the ballot box in 2016.
[01:28:29.819 --> 01:28:34.663]  They are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that they can't beat him in 2020 either.
[01:28:35.023 --> 01:28:37.565]  Impeachment is the only option they have.
[01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.346]  We're good.
[01:28:53.579 --> 01:29:01.942]  With a match in his hand about to set a building on fire saying, now pray with me that the destruction I'm about to cause isn't too severe.
[01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:05.583]  I mean, if he's sincere, he'll put down the dang match.
[01:29:05.943 --> 01:29:11.705]  And if Nancy Pelosi is sincere about bringing this nation together, she will drop this impeachment effort.
[01:29:11.965 --> 01:29:16.427]  Let the American people decide one year from now at the ballot box.
[01:29:16.807 --> 01:29:18.248]  But she is uncomfortable.
[01:29:18.328 --> 01:29:23.770]  She's scared to death at what the American people will choose to do, and that is to keep Donald J. Trump in office.
[01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.951]  You know, we just assume they're praying to God.
[01:29:25.971 --> 01:29:27.012]  I'm not quite sure.
[01:29:27.032 --> 01:29:28.232]  I don't know, Dr. Jeffress.
[01:29:28.253 --> 01:29:30.914]  I mean, they booed God, tried to vote him out of the party plan for him.
[01:29:30.974 --> 01:29:39.618]  I mean... Well, apparently the God they worship is the God of the pagan God of the Old Testament, Malak, who allowed for child sacrifice.
[01:29:40.018 --> 01:29:45.643]  I mean, the God of the Bible doesn't sanction the killing of millions and millions of children in the womb.
[01:29:46.023 --> 01:29:49.586]  I think the God they are worshipping is the God of their own imagination.
[01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:52.171]  Now you know why that was taken off the air.
[01:29:52.251 --> 01:29:53.512]  It's powerful Paul Revere.
[01:29:53.612 --> 01:29:54.893]  It's the truth that strikes the heart.
[01:29:55.494 --> 01:29:56.615]  And Trump tweeted it.
[01:29:57.035 --> 01:30:00.638]  And so anyone that Trump supports must be punished because they're supporting Trump.
[01:30:01.138 --> 01:30:02.479]  This is pure mafia tactics.
[01:30:02.519 --> 01:30:03.580]  I looked up the show this morning.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:04.661]  Had great ratings.
[01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:06.602]  I was a powerful preacher, powerful host.
[01:30:07.082 --> 01:30:08.243]  Hell, I ought to tune into that show.
[01:30:08.624 --> 01:30:09.604]  Oh, sorry, you can't.
[01:30:09.965 --> 01:30:10.945]  It's been taken off the air.
[01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.587]  We should invite that guy to have a show here.
[01:30:13.167 --> 01:30:13.807]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:14.948]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:15.008 --> 01:30:15.849]  Newswars.com.
[01:30:16.069 --> 01:30:16.910]  Band.video.
[01:30:18.791 --> 01:30:19.452]  We have entered
[01:30:20.842 --> 01:30:24.366]  A major jump point in human civilization, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:25.547 --> 01:30:27.949]  Amazing things are happening all around us.
[01:30:29.111 --> 01:30:36.739]  Mike Adams is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment to get into that central report that we never got to yesterday.
[01:30:37.947 --> 01:30:53.982]  That breaks down the larger globalist plan to take the president out and I believe the report is dead on the hierarchy of deep state escalation that will end and the attempted assassination of President Trump and engineered terrorism across America to bring us into a civil war.
[01:30:54.002 --> 01:30:59.728]  I also want to get into the latest censorship that's taking place.
[01:31:01.232 --> 01:31:08.574]  Against conservatives, nationalists, and Christians, persecuting them, taking away their livelihood and their right to buy and sell in many cases.
[01:31:09.054 --> 01:31:11.195]  They don't submit to the technocracy.
[01:31:11.915 --> 01:31:16.497]  But only a technocracy could surveil everything and allow this type of anti-human system to come in.
[01:31:17.377 --> 01:31:21.218]  That's why it's so dangerous and has to be resisted before it becomes ubiquitous.
[01:31:22.239 --> 01:31:24.839]  The smart system is really a slave system.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:29.481]  But first, I want to play part of yesterday's press conference where they were sitting down
[01:31:31.843 --> 01:31:35.726]  Not the one where he was standing up with the President of Finland.
[01:31:36.727 --> 01:31:49.918]  It was extremely powerful, and I'm not going to have time to get to all of it, but Trump did a great job as he tackled fake news about the border moat.
[01:31:49.958 --> 01:31:53.601]  I'll get to that after I played part of this report.
[01:31:54.585 --> 01:31:59.367]  So this is Trump participates in meeting with President of Finland, takes Q&A on the whistleblower.
[01:31:59.427 --> 01:32:02.969]  This is the press conference that we didn't get to yesterday.
[01:32:03.369 --> 01:32:04.749]  So here's just part of those highlights.
[01:32:10.814 --> 01:32:12.595]  Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate.
[01:32:12.735 --> 01:32:19.898]  The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine.
[01:32:19.938 --> 01:32:21.199]  Hit pause and start it over again.
[01:32:21.379 --> 01:32:22.679]  That's why I can't really air these.
[01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:23.860]  Stop it for five seconds.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:27.982]  Did you hear that hateful deceiver that calls himself a reporter?
[01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:30.823]  Yeah.
[01:32:30.883 --> 01:32:34.124]  You're hurting the life, you're endangering the life of the whistleblower.
[01:32:34.665 --> 01:32:36.886]  It's a secret person, you have a right to face your accuser.
[01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:39.603]  The word is, it isn't even a real person.
[01:32:39.643 --> 01:32:46.008]  It's a composite of lies put together by Schiff, who reportedly wrote the whistleblower complaint.
[01:32:46.028 --> 01:32:53.435]  I mean, he reads fake transcripts of the President in the Judiciary Committee that he chairs.
[01:32:54.055 --> 01:32:57.718]  So, the intel that it looks like there is no whistleblower is probably true.
[01:32:58.059 --> 01:33:00.921]  They'll probably get someone to claim they heard it third-hand now.
[01:33:01.502 --> 01:33:04.785]  But Schiff is a megalomaniac and thinks he's invincible.
[01:33:05.606 --> 01:33:08.929]  Because of all of the things he's gotten away with in his private life, reportedly.
[01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.791]  Big buddies with Bucky Boy.
[01:33:13.032 --> 01:33:17.316]  So, these sicko freaks are really something, aren't they?
[01:33:17.836 --> 01:33:21.399]  So, let's go back to this snake, this spitting cobra.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:24.962]  You're endangering their life when you defend yourself!
[01:33:25.202 --> 01:33:25.883]  You're guilty!
[01:33:25.923 --> 01:33:27.244]  How dare you exonerate yourself!
[01:33:27.444 --> 01:33:28.085]  We're lying!
[01:33:28.105 --> 01:33:29.546]  You're supposed to roll over and die!
[01:33:29.726 --> 01:33:31.067]  We're the anointed ones!
[01:33:31.327 --> 01:33:31.688]  Here it is.
[01:33:35.353 --> 01:33:37.114]  Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate.
[01:33:37.254 --> 01:33:39.975]  The whistleblower started this whole thing... Wait, back it up again.
[01:33:39.995 --> 01:33:40.676]  I gotta say more.
[01:33:40.976 --> 01:33:42.817]  Do you hear that pretentious voice?
[01:33:43.157 --> 01:33:46.378]  You are putting the whistleblower's life in danger!
[01:33:46.398 --> 01:33:49.600]  She just... How dare you!
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:53.302]  I mean... Can you imagine if these people actually ran everything?
[01:33:53.342 --> 01:33:54.082]  They almost do!
[01:33:54.302 --> 01:33:55.202]  They've got your kids!
[01:33:56.743 --> 01:33:58.784]  These are the authoritarians that run big tech!
[01:33:59.605 --> 01:34:02.426]  They have no chivalry, no control, no nothing.
[01:34:02.466 --> 01:34:04.387]  They just want to do whatever they want!
[01:34:05.486 --> 01:34:06.147]  They're idiots!
[01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:11.734]  Chivalry is rule so we don't all kill each other, dumbasses.
[01:34:12.215 --> 01:34:12.895]  Talking to the left.
[01:34:13.756 --> 01:34:14.818]  I'm gonna stop interrupting.
[01:34:14.838 --> 01:34:15.379]  Go ahead and play it.
[01:34:15.947 --> 01:34:16.787]  I'll tell you what.
[01:34:46.124 --> 01:34:48.066]  He should be forced to resign from Congress.
[01:34:48.226 --> 01:34:48.807]  Adam Schiff.
[01:34:48.847 --> 01:34:49.607]  He's a lowlife.
[01:34:49.687 --> 01:34:51.049]  He should be forced to resign.
[01:34:51.949 --> 01:34:56.914]  He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn't read it to Congress because it was perfect.
[01:34:56.934 --> 01:34:58.315]  It was a very nice conversation.
[01:34:58.676 --> 01:35:00.197]  I knew many people were on the phone.
[01:35:00.637 --> 01:35:06.663]  Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down word for word.
[01:35:06.723 --> 01:35:09.385]  He took that conversation, which was perfect.
[01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:11.546]  He said, I can't read this.
[01:35:12.386 --> 01:35:18.707]  So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people.
[01:35:19.208 --> 01:35:20.588]  And it was horrible what he said.
[01:35:21.668 --> 01:35:23.528]  And that was supposed to be coming from me.
[01:35:24.008 --> 01:35:25.269]  But it was all fabricated.
[01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:28.009]  He should resign from office in disgrace.
[01:35:28.769 --> 01:35:34.690]  And frankly, they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States.
[01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:36.531]  Not only words, but the meaning.
[01:35:36.911 --> 01:35:37.771]  And it's a disgrace.
[01:35:37.811 --> 01:35:39.171]  It should not be allowed to happen.
[01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:44.941]  No, no, no.
[01:35:44.981 --> 01:35:45.701]  He didn't say that.
[01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:46.641]  You have to take a look.
[01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:47.341]  No, no, no.
[01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:48.362]  He did not say that.
[01:35:48.822 --> 01:35:52.542]  And, in fact, if you look at what he said, he found everything to be very normal.
[01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:53.663]  He's a good man.
[01:35:54.343 --> 01:35:54.843]  And Joe.
[01:35:55.243 --> 01:35:56.863]  And he found it to be very normal.
[01:35:57.323 --> 01:36:00.364]  I saw Schiff trying to go 15, you know, call him Shifty Schiff.
[01:36:00.404 --> 01:36:02.324]  We don't call him Shifty Schiff for nothing.
[01:36:02.364 --> 01:36:04.724]  He's a shifty, dishonest guy.
[01:36:05.465 --> 01:36:06.945]  Who, by the way, was critical of
[01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:09.527]  One of the great Secretary of State.
[01:36:09.588 --> 01:36:12.731]  Graduated number one in his class at West Point.
[01:36:13.252 --> 01:36:17.117]  Graduated one of the top of his class at Harvard Law School.
[01:36:18.419 --> 01:36:20.762]  The most honorable person, Mike Pompeo.
[01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:23.986]  And this guy was negative on Mike Pompeo.
[01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:29.292]  He can't, you know, there's an expression, he couldn't carry his blank strap.
[01:36:29.352 --> 01:36:31.693]  I won't say it because they'll say it was so terrible to say.
[01:36:32.193 --> 01:36:34.875]  But that guy couldn't carry his blank strap.
[01:36:35.035 --> 01:36:35.795]  You understand that?
[01:36:36.476 --> 01:36:39.077]  So, you deal with bad people, and you know,
[01:36:40.054 --> 01:36:45.258]  I watched China over the last few days, and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up.
[01:36:45.318 --> 01:36:47.459]  And we've built up more than any of them because of me.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.601]  But no help due to the Democrats.
[01:36:49.621 --> 01:36:50.462]  They're a disaster.
[01:36:51.182 --> 01:36:52.863]  They're the do-nothing Democrats.
[01:36:52.903 --> 01:36:53.784]  They don't do any work.
[01:36:54.404 --> 01:36:56.546]  All they want to do is try and win the election in 2020.
[01:36:57.327 --> 01:37:00.549]  So they come up with this impeachment nonsense, and everyone knows.
[01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:04.312]  The conversation, all based on one phone call that I had.
[01:37:04.992 --> 01:37:16.426]  Where I'm talking to the President of Ukraine, you'll hear from our ambassadors, you'll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call, why the call was set up, and everything else.
[01:37:16.487 --> 01:37:17.047]  It's perfect.
[01:37:17.408 --> 01:37:18.449]  The call was perfect.
[01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:21.633]  In fact, Lindsey Graham said, I didn't know you could be so nice.
[01:37:22.174 --> 01:37:23.635]  There was no quid pro quo.
[01:37:24.196 --> 01:37:33.160]  Remember before they said, the only reason I put that out, and I did it with the approval of Ukraine, by the way, otherwise I couldn't have done it, was because the whistleblower was so dishonest.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:41.003]  The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but he then, I then found out he was second-hand and third-hand.
[01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:42.624]  In other words, he didn't know what was on the call.
[01:37:43.004 --> 01:37:44.505]  No, these are bad people.
[01:37:45.005 --> 01:37:46.185]  These are dishonest people.
[01:37:46.205 --> 01:37:47.546]  Again, I'm gonna stop right here.
[01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:49.086]  Folks, it's completely obvious.
[01:37:49.207 --> 01:37:50.227]  We all know what's going on.
[01:37:52.779 --> 01:37:53.560]  Schiff made it up.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:08.150]  We now know that the committee had it, not days, but a week before it supposedly was reported to the Justice Department as a whistleblower.
[01:38:10.612 --> 01:38:12.233]  The text was in Schiff's hands.
[01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:14.214]  Of course, he wrote it with lawyers.
[01:38:15.255 --> 01:38:15.695]  We know!
[01:38:16.075 --> 01:38:16.596]  They wrote it!
[01:38:16.836 --> 01:38:17.737]  We know lawyers wrote it!
[01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:19.984]  So they just made this up.
[01:38:20.024 --> 01:38:22.366]  Did they talk to a few people that said, oh, I heard?
[01:38:22.466 --> 01:38:22.826]  Maybe.
[01:38:23.467 --> 01:38:26.189]  But he's already putting out fake transcripts.
[01:38:28.491 --> 01:38:38.279]  Hoping that that's what was on the tape, it's been recorded, and what the stenographers, you know, the court reporters, basically, those stenographers wrote down.
[01:38:38.699 --> 01:38:45.545]  Because that's what five senators, it's not four, five senators, McCain's dead now, but he's on record threatening them if they didn't do it.
[01:38:46.618 --> 01:38:55.467]  He wanted four living senators and all these other people and shifts on the phone been recorded demanding stuff out of the Ukrainians and being chomped.
[01:38:56.328 --> 01:38:59.391]  So they thought Trump acts like a thug like they did.
[01:39:02.555 --> 01:39:05.278]  And so Schiff with a couple lawyers cooked this up.
[01:39:06.319 --> 01:39:08.581]  By the way, that's what I said last week.
[01:39:08.661 --> 01:39:09.081]  That's what
[01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:15.212]  Levin said he's a lawyer.
[01:39:15.732 --> 01:39:17.933]  He read, he said lawyers wrote this, not a whistleblower.
[01:39:18.974 --> 01:39:21.155]  Said big corporate lawyers, yeah, like Schiff.
[01:39:22.116 --> 01:39:22.696]  Shifty Schiff.
[01:39:23.297 --> 01:39:32.422]  If he'll read a fake transcript up there and then only later say it's fake, a little proviso, oh my, no one bought that, that was real.
[01:39:32.442 --> 01:39:32.682]  Later.
[01:39:33.343 --> 01:39:34.423]  Of course it's from him.
[01:39:35.804 --> 01:39:36.344]  I'm telling you.
[01:39:37.125 --> 01:39:38.766]  He wrote it with two or three other people.
[01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:41.551]  They'll claim they heard it from somebody else.
[01:39:41.811 --> 01:39:42.391]  It's all fake.
[01:39:42.791 --> 01:39:43.371]  It's fake, too.
[01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:44.491]  We know it's a lie.
[01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:46.332]  Ha ha ha!
[01:39:46.752 --> 01:39:47.572]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:39:47.653 --> 01:39:47.993]  Watch.
[01:39:48.333 --> 01:39:48.773]  He wrote it.
[01:39:49.273 --> 01:39:49.693]  He wrote it.
[01:39:51.874 --> 01:39:53.114]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:53.714 --> 01:39:55.055]  I wanted to get Mike Adams back on.
[01:39:55.095 --> 01:40:01.237]  I appreciate him joining us because he wrote an article a few days ago that's paramount at naturalnews.com.
[01:40:04.025 --> 01:40:11.728]  The hierarchy of deep state escalation that will end in the attempted assassination of President Trump and engineered terrorism across America.
[01:40:12.708 --> 01:40:18.830]  And sometimes if something is so serious and so real, people can't seem to grip it or deal with it.
[01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:21.511]  If it's a nebulous theory, well then people are excited about it.
[01:40:22.091 --> 01:40:27.193]  But when the Democrats are openly saying they're going to kill him, they're going to remove him, they're going to impeach, imprison, kill.
[01:40:28.693 --> 01:40:33.195]  You've predicted, I know yesterday off air you said, I think they're going to try to Epstein him if they can ever get him in jail.
[01:40:34.912 --> 01:40:37.113]  And they keep moving forward with all this impeachment.
[01:40:37.133 --> 01:40:38.193]  It's a very serious threat.
[01:40:38.233 --> 01:40:41.354]  Not that he's done anything wrong, but justice doesn't matter here.
[01:40:42.274 --> 01:40:49.076]  If they can threaten enough senators, and we see all these Republicans resigning and quitting under blackmail or payoffs, they can get what they want.
[01:40:49.436 --> 01:40:51.877]  But I agree with you, if they don't succeed, they're going to go to assassination.
[01:40:52.157 --> 01:40:54.918]  Let's talk about the hierarchy of deep state escalation.
[01:40:54.938 --> 01:40:57.398]  Let's encapsulate it and then go through the details.
[01:40:57.638 --> 01:40:58.899]  Thanks for joining us, Mike Adams.
[01:40:59.819 --> 01:41:00.119]  You bet.
[01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:01.719]  Glad to join you today, Alex.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.520]  What's important for people to understand is that
[01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:14.736]  They're going to have to hunker down for a very long, drawn-out war that the deep state Democrats are going to take to a hot phase if they don't succeed in taking Trump out with a soft coup.
[01:41:15.117 --> 01:41:23.702]  So they do have a schedule of escalation, and that schedule includes kinetic warfare, terrorism, and they're going to target the deplorables.
[01:41:23.802 --> 01:41:28.224]  So it's not enough for the left to just destroy Trump or try to even kill Trump.
[01:41:28.564 --> 01:41:32.607]  They also want to punish and terrorize Trump supporters all across America.
[01:41:33.228 --> 01:41:46.973]  For example, I believe that certain cities like El Paso not long ago are being chosen because they are in red America to carry out or encourage, you know, acts of violence against the American people.
[01:41:47.333 --> 01:41:50.374]  I wouldn't be surprised to see that pattern repeated all across America.
[01:41:51.661 --> 01:42:14.542]  You gotta understand, and I know you do, but the deep state, they don't care how many innocent Americans they kill in the process of taking out the president if they think they can succeed in assassinating Trump, or even having what I said, an area effect weapon, which could be biological, nuclear, or chemical, something that they could blame on a patriot.
[01:42:14.983 --> 01:42:16.364]  So that way they could
[01:42:17.084 --> 01:42:34.834]  Let's be clear, the Democrats are all saying we have to wipe out his supporters, we have to level them, we have to destroy them.
[01:42:34.874 --> 01:42:36.975]  These are all terms being used as talking points.
[01:42:37.376 --> 01:42:38.696]  You can turn channel to channel.
[01:42:38.996 --> 01:42:42.318]  They're saying it's not enough to remove Trump, we need to kill Trump.
[01:42:42.658 --> 01:42:43.799]  And they're getting away with it.
[01:42:43.859 --> 01:42:45.300]  So it shows they're trying.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:52.381]  To normalize with their operatives going to this level, but the Clintons we know are still in charge to a certain extent of the deep state.
[01:42:52.941 --> 01:42:54.082]  They staged Oklahoma City.
[01:42:54.102 --> 01:42:55.202]  That was conclusively proven.
[01:42:55.482 --> 01:42:56.422]  Films, books have been written.
[01:42:56.442 --> 01:42:57.402]  We know the names of who did it.
[01:42:57.422 --> 01:42:59.002]  The bombs, the hotel receipts.
[01:42:59.082 --> 01:43:00.103]  Very sloppily done.
[01:43:00.563 --> 01:43:01.883]  He was going to lose re-election.
[01:43:02.603 --> 01:43:05.204]  He said the next year he won re-election.
[01:43:05.964 --> 01:43:08.504]  He said on Air Force One to the press corps because of Oklahoma City.
[01:43:08.804 --> 01:43:10.525]  So yes, they follow the same patterns.
[01:43:10.845 --> 01:43:12.165]  So look for big false flags.
[01:43:13.275 --> 01:43:24.839]  In fact, if you go back through American history, and I've been studying more about the JFK assassination as written by the late Jim Mars, who was one of the best independent investigators in the history of the state of Texas, by the way.
[01:43:25.319 --> 01:43:27.260]  You know, media, a real journalist, Jim Mars.
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:29.260]  And a good friend of mine.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.061]  Sad to lose him.
[01:43:30.141 --> 01:43:30.581]  Absolutely.
[01:43:31.421 --> 01:43:31.722]  I know.
[01:43:31.802 --> 01:43:33.984]  He was a real treasure for our time.
[01:43:35.005 --> 01:43:37.367]  JFK was assassinated by the Deep State.
[01:43:37.707 --> 01:43:42.011]  And then RFK, Senator RFK, was assassinated by the Deep State.
[01:43:42.252 --> 01:43:46.315]  And then Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated by the Deep State, threatened by the FBI.
[01:43:46.556 --> 01:43:48.377]  The FBI ran all the cover-ups in all these.
[01:43:48.718 --> 01:43:52.001]  And then you go to 9-11, or you go to Oklahoma City,
[01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:57.542]  Which was carried out, of course, to try to silence and censor Rush Limbaugh and conservative radio.
[01:43:57.582 --> 01:43:59.063]  They were trying to shut that down.
[01:43:59.143 --> 01:44:02.324]  Within 25 minutes, Bill Clinton blamed talk radio and Rush Limbaugh.
[01:44:02.344 --> 01:44:02.564]  Yes.
[01:44:03.344 --> 01:44:09.085]  So you gotta understand, folks, everything you think you know about American history, it's all been staged.
[01:44:09.825 --> 01:44:11.526]  Every major event has been
[01:44:12.987 --> 01:44:17.931]  Fabricated, well, I mean the real events, real violence, but the narratives are faked for your mind.
[01:44:18.231 --> 01:44:19.413]  It's theater for your mind.
[01:44:19.873 --> 01:44:25.538]  And they are doing the same exact thing right now, and they are always willing to kill thousands of Americans.
[01:44:25.778 --> 01:44:30.903]  They've done it before, and they're going to try to do it again, especially if they can take out Trump in the process.
[01:44:31.203 --> 01:44:36.949]  But what I think they underestimate, Alex, is that the backlash from the American people would be
[01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:38.670]  Historic.
[01:44:38.710 --> 01:44:39.892]  I mean, the people.
[01:44:39.912 --> 01:44:42.474]  See, they think it's just Trump, right?
[01:44:42.755 --> 01:44:46.038]  They think if Trump goes away, the American people are going to fall back in the line.
[01:44:46.298 --> 01:44:47.379]  And that's never going to happen.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:52.805]  Trump is just a representative of what the people want and now demand.
[01:44:52.925 --> 01:44:53.245]  Liberty.
[01:44:53.546 --> 01:44:54.767]  National sovereignty.
[01:44:54.847 --> 01:44:55.868]  National security.
[01:44:55.988 --> 01:44:57.810]  All of these things that are important to the American people.
[01:44:58.350 --> 01:45:00.713]  Even if they were to take out Trump, God forbid,
[01:45:01.744 --> 01:45:09.568]  The American people, I believe, would rise up and defend their nation against these tyrants, these deep state traitors, these treasonous actors that Trump is trying to take down.
[01:45:10.328 --> 01:45:11.769]  So, I think the left loses either way.
[01:45:12.249 --> 01:45:19.533]  There have been criminal networks in every major powerful empire or government ever, and there's always a fight where evil tries to take over something virtuous, strong.
[01:45:19.553 --> 01:45:21.914]  I mean, America was amazing compared to other nations.
[01:45:21.934 --> 01:45:26.276]  We still had big problems, but hands down the most freedom, the most success, the most inventions, the most wealth.
[01:45:26.596 --> 01:45:29.221]  The most real chance to be diverse in your ideas.
[01:45:29.582 --> 01:45:35.593]  True liberalism, not fake modern fascism under the name liberalism or the whole left-hand path system.
[01:45:36.957 --> 01:45:40.658]  You always had compartmentalization in the FBI, the CIA, these agencies.
[01:45:41.018 --> 01:45:52.702]  Most people weren't bad, but it was the top groups, the globalist groups, the bluebloods, that were actually using the clandestine systems to carry this out, where everything was like a Lego set, but only the elites could put it all together.
[01:45:53.022 --> 01:46:01.545]  Well now, because of the internet and other things, that's all decompartmentalized, and so one of the biggest things hanging over their head isn't just the American people, it's people in these agencies now know the big picture.
[01:46:02.405 --> 01:46:03.085]  I don't think so.
[01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:25.750]  This is where you really get the truth.
[01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:26.951]  It's the guest on Alex Jones.
[01:46:26.971 --> 01:46:27.591]  This guy gets it.
[01:46:27.611 --> 01:46:29.112]  I can't tell you the secret stuff.
[01:46:29.152 --> 01:46:29.812]  Just listen to this.
[01:46:30.052 --> 01:46:30.473]  It's true.
[01:46:30.973 --> 01:46:39.476]  So I'm not bragging, but we were used, you and all the guests here, as a decompartmentalization by people inside that didn't like what was happening.
[01:46:39.677 --> 01:46:42.738]  So it's been a process of us not being naive anymore is what I'm saying.
[01:46:43.783 --> 01:46:44.583]  Well, right, exactly.
[01:46:44.603 --> 01:46:52.685]  I mean, the reason for the desperation is because they've lost control of the narrative because of the rise of independent media, which really has encouraged independent thinking.
[01:46:52.985 --> 01:47:01.286]  And the greatest enemy to the deep state tyrants and authoritarians is people who can think for themselves, just like George Carlin said in a clip I think you ran yesterday.
[01:47:02.126 --> 01:47:12.908]  It's obedient workers that they want, and they can't have people who can think for themselves and question the system and ask rational questions like, hey, why are all the heartburn drugs being sold at the pharmacies
[01:47:13.389 --> 01:47:18.281]  Contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals and that news just broke yesterday or the day before.
[01:47:22.213 --> 01:47:22.913]  Let's expand on that.
[01:47:22.933 --> 01:47:23.873]  Go ahead.
[01:47:24.053 --> 01:47:29.134]  Well, look, Big Pharma runs a repeat business model for revenues.
[01:47:29.555 --> 01:47:31.295]  Their drugs give you cancer.
[01:47:31.815 --> 01:47:32.895]  And it's now admitted.
[01:47:32.935 --> 01:47:33.895]  It's now out in the open.
[01:47:33.935 --> 01:47:43.377]  You take their heartburn drugs that you buy over the counter, you're going to get cancer because they contain a chemical compound called nitrosamines, or NDMA, which is in that class.
[01:47:43.617 --> 01:47:47.678]  And they will give you cancer, and they'll make money off you as you're dying and suffering from cancer.
[01:47:47.818 --> 01:47:50.279]  Because they don't care about you, they just want to use you and
[01:47:51.139 --> 01:47:52.760]  Toss you out like trash.
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:53.980]  No, they do care.
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:56.501]  They want to torture you slowly and get all your money.
[01:47:56.841 --> 01:48:04.704]  Like the Bayer documents show, they knowingly put HIV and hepatitis in with the Clintons on purpose as an act of evil.
[01:48:04.724 --> 01:48:08.305]  They admitted that in lawsuits, that they did it on purpose as an act of evil.
[01:48:08.585 --> 01:48:09.346]  So you're wrong, Mike.
[01:48:09.446 --> 01:48:10.126]  They love to kill us.
[01:48:10.166 --> 01:48:10.606]  They love us.
[01:48:13.087 --> 01:48:15.308]  Alright, Mike Adams is here, and if you're a new listener,
[01:48:17.383 --> 01:48:30.210]  And you just tuned in, we've been playing clips of top Democrats saying, kill the president, imprison him, torture him, assassinate him, and it's been going on for three years, but it's getting bad.
[01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:34.332]  Now that's what tyrants will do, is they'll normalize you to something.
[01:48:34.372 --> 01:48:42.797]  Them bullying people, attacking people, going to Tucker Carlson's house, other people's houses, I'm not going to give them any attention, but it's getting out of control.
[01:48:42.857 --> 01:48:44.578]  So we're talking about, what do we do to counter that?
[01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:49.251]  Because we just get up here and cover these huge issues.
[01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:52.774]  China shipping in thousands of tons of fentanyl, enough to kill the planet.
[01:48:53.814 --> 01:48:56.196]  Just all this stuff, but we're just up here talking about it.
[01:48:56.216 --> 01:48:57.557]  It almost normalizes it.
[01:48:57.857 --> 01:48:58.558]  You know, I've noticed...
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:05.584]  Before, if I wear sunglasses on air, the view counts on the videos go way up.
[01:49:05.925 --> 01:49:09.487]  Or if I wear a cowboy hat, or a ball cap, it's just something different.
[01:49:09.847 --> 01:49:13.410]  Even though I'm covering all these incredible issues that are going on.
[01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:19.654]  Like you can have Liberty Mutual, and they're not a sponsor, giving people huge discounts on their insurance.
[01:49:19.934 --> 01:49:21.235]  I've looked into it, pretty good deals.
[01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:26.119]  If they have an emu there, everyone goes and looks at their website.
[01:49:27.025 --> 01:49:28.866]  But if they don't have the emu, nothing happens.
[01:49:28.906 --> 01:49:30.567]  Or it's like the Geico lizard.
[01:49:31.707 --> 01:49:33.728]  Or Aflac with the duck or whatever.
[01:49:34.468 --> 01:49:36.909]  So, you know, I don't have fancy stuff like that.
[01:49:36.929 --> 01:49:38.190]  All I've got is sunglasses here.
[01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:40.311]  But people now have a big viral thing online.
[01:49:40.351 --> 01:49:41.311]  Why is he wearing sunglasses?
[01:49:41.952 --> 01:49:47.274]  So what I'm getting at here is, Mike Adams, we're covering shocking, groundbreaking, huge stuff.
[01:49:47.754 --> 01:49:50.055]  We've got a president trying to get control of the country again.
[01:49:50.095 --> 01:49:51.476]  We've been sold out to multinationals.
[01:49:51.856 --> 01:49:52.896]  This is beyond a movie.
[01:49:52.936 --> 01:49:53.617]  It's so epic.
[01:49:53.917 --> 01:49:56.258]  They're saying we're going to kill him if we can't remove him.
[01:49:57.998 --> 01:50:01.839]  They're putting out huge hoaxes everywhere, and it's escalating.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:05.121]  And, you know, it's kind of like putting a piece of paper on top of a stove.
[01:50:05.561 --> 01:50:07.642]  It browns and suddenly flashes into flame.
[01:50:08.042 --> 01:50:11.863]  We're reaching that flashpoint one way or the other, so what do we do?
[01:50:11.883 --> 01:50:14.304]  Do I have, like, llamas on the show or something?
[01:50:14.604 --> 01:50:15.644]  To get people's attention?
[01:50:15.965 --> 01:50:17.685]  I mean, how serious this is?
[01:50:17.945 --> 01:50:18.806]  Fireworks go off?
[01:50:18.866 --> 01:50:19.646]  I mean, what needs to happen?
[01:50:20.848 --> 01:50:28.312]  Well, I mean, yeah, you make a good point, because it requires a cognitive understanding of history and what's happening right now.
[01:50:28.652 --> 01:50:37.997]  And frankly, you know, human neurology has been studied by the globalists, and the globalists have found ways to bypass all logic and reason by using mass hysteria.
[01:50:38.358 --> 01:50:47.883]  And of course, the reason they use children, these climate crisis children like Greta, is because, you know, the appearance of a child disarms anyone's criticism.
[01:50:48.263 --> 01:50:53.408]  So now they roll out child actors and they roll out fear campaigns that are rooted in nothing.
[01:50:53.768 --> 01:51:01.636]  And they use distractions to make sure that no one can ever cover the truth of what's happening now or even remember what happened yesterday.
[01:51:01.916 --> 01:51:03.918]  And of course, as you know very well, all along,
[01:51:04.378 --> 01:51:08.061]  All the time here, they're pushing fluoride in the water supply to dumb you down.
[01:51:08.081 --> 01:51:10.863]  They're pushing lead, you know, in the food to dumb you down.
[01:51:11.263 --> 01:51:16.867]  And now, you know, cancer chemicals in the prescription drugs and the over-the-counter medications and everything else.
[01:51:16.927 --> 01:51:24.013]  So, it's a massive assault on neurology, but they've reverse-engineered the way the human mind works.
[01:51:24.193 --> 01:51:25.654]  What the heck is going on?
[01:51:26.494 --> 01:51:27.135]  What do you have there?
[01:51:29.417 --> 01:51:30.117]  No, I mean, keep going.
[01:51:30.157 --> 01:51:32.318]  Make people tune in to Band.Video for the live feed.
[01:51:32.338 --> 01:51:34.178]  We're not going to tell them what's happening on TV right now.
[01:51:35.378 --> 01:51:36.198]  Oh, okay, okay.
[01:51:36.279 --> 01:51:38.379]  This is a psychological warfare test I'm doing.
[01:51:38.399 --> 01:51:39.879]  Maybe people care about what's actually happening.
[01:51:40.119 --> 01:51:41.940]  They don't care about millions of us dying from fentanyl.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.840]  Maybe they'll care about this.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:44.600]  Don't tell them what you see.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.421]  Don't tell them, Mike, what you're seeing over Skype right now.
[01:51:46.441 --> 01:51:47.061]  It's too shocking.
[01:51:47.421 --> 01:51:47.721]  Come on.
[01:51:47.961 --> 01:51:48.921]  Okay, okay.
[01:51:48.981 --> 01:51:56.563]  Well, look, I'm just going to say that people do need to be awakened to what's going on, and if you need to use a little shock value,
[01:51:56.983 --> 01:51:59.344]  To kind of reset their brains to say, whoa, I'm alive.
[01:51:59.404 --> 01:51:59.785]  I'm here.
[01:51:59.825 --> 01:52:00.425]  We're in a battle.
[01:52:00.445 --> 01:52:01.425]  We're fighting for humanity.
[01:52:01.726 --> 01:52:03.066]  Then, you know, do that.
[01:52:03.206 --> 01:52:05.528]  Do what you need to do because we are in the fight for our lives.
[01:52:06.108 --> 01:52:15.353]  We're in the fight for the survival of the human species, frankly, not just America, not just Trump, not just patriots or Christianity, but survival of the human race.
[01:52:15.613 --> 01:52:17.614]  And that's what you understand so much.
[01:52:17.774 --> 01:52:18.575]  And I do as well.
[01:52:18.615 --> 01:52:22.937]  And that's I think that's why people are tuning in, because they want to know what's really at stake.
[01:52:23.627 --> 01:52:24.988]  Does that make sense?
[01:52:25.108 --> 01:52:26.329]  No, it's absolutely true.
[01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:42.417]  And, you know, Mike, I've just found that, again, people, when something's right out in the open, Dianne Feinstein with a communist Chinese agent running her office, and all these others getting caught being on the foreign payroll of a government and a system that has killed more people than Hitler, I'm really concerned about it.
[01:52:42.757 --> 01:52:45.539]  But, like, if I had a little Geico lizard, would people care?
[01:52:45.639 --> 01:52:46.379]  Maybe an emu.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:47.520]  What if I had a llama?
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:48.981]  Would they listen if I had a llama?
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:50.681]  I don't know.
[01:52:50.801 --> 01:52:52.785]  A llama in the background.
[01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:54.248]  Llamas in pajamas.
[01:52:54.509 --> 01:52:55.110]  I don't know.
[01:52:55.170 --> 01:52:56.132]  Pajama boy llamas.
[01:52:56.172 --> 01:52:56.914]  Whatever you need to do, man.
[01:52:56.934 --> 01:52:58.517]  I want to ask you, are you llama-phobic?
[01:53:00.672 --> 01:53:04.577]  Well, uh, they do spit on people from time to time, but we're used to that.
[01:53:04.597 --> 01:53:08.421]  You know, Mad Maxine seems to do that at Trump all the time, so who knows?
[01:53:08.761 --> 01:53:11.524]  Maybe we're gonna have, you know, spitting crazed llamas.
[01:53:11.564 --> 01:53:14.568]  Are they left-wing llamas that you have in mind?
[01:53:14.608 --> 01:53:19.393]  Well, I gotta tell you, there are llamas in the studio right now, and I think they're scared of the lights and scared of me, which is wise.
[01:53:20.434 --> 01:53:25.040]  Uh, but, uh, I'm gonna actually get on my wireless mic here in a minute and bring them over here.
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.303]  I thought, you know, other people have lizards and emus.
[01:53:27.924 --> 01:53:28.685]  I like llamas.
[01:53:29.566 --> 01:53:33.571]  And, you know, the crazy thing is, once you start talking about llamas, suddenly there's llamas everywhere.
[01:53:34.551 --> 01:53:35.191]  I don't know.
[01:53:52.302 --> 01:53:56.605]  They get freaked out about any kind of movement, or lights, or even clothing flapping.
[01:53:57.045 --> 01:54:01.167]  So, you're gonna have to, like, shut down all the animation to make it calm for them.
[01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:05.210]  Although, I'm sure they will enjoy the air conditioning, because they're high elevation animals.
[01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:05.730]  Exactly.
[01:54:06.190 --> 01:54:13.454]  Well, what I'm doing, Mike, is I'm, again, just doing psychological warfare in a good way here, because I found this.
[01:54:13.955 --> 01:54:16.616]  Again, let's just keep going, Mike.
[01:54:17.737 --> 01:54:18.837]  Well, okay.
[01:54:19.138 --> 01:54:19.498]  But look,
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:24.862]  Whatever we have to do that's legal and lawful and perhaps even entertaining to wake people up.
[01:54:25.002 --> 01:54:28.763]  This is, I guess, the way neurology works these days.
[01:54:29.583 --> 01:54:35.285]  Maybe we do have to jump up and down and scream for humanity to wake up and try to survive by itself.
[01:54:35.926 --> 01:54:43.148]  Why aren't there millions of people marching against the deep state right now, peacefully in Washington, D.C., demanding the arrest of these traitors?
[01:54:43.468 --> 01:54:47.410]  Why aren't there millions of people in the streets right now, again, legally and lawfully, peacefully,
[01:54:49.472 --> 01:55:01.829]  Maybe we need a new approach, a new symbol, a new mascot, some kind of new way to get into people's heads that this is your survival.
[01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:05.013]  If they defeat Trump, if they take Alex Jones off the air,
[01:55:05.925 --> 01:55:07.407]  Then you're next, folks.
[01:55:07.627 --> 01:55:08.408]  You are next.
[01:55:08.908 --> 01:55:10.931]  It's not about Trump per se.
[01:55:10.971 --> 01:55:12.112]  He's just in the way.
[01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:14.394]  They're going to come after you next.
[01:55:14.434 --> 01:55:18.038]  And the reason they want your guns, of course, is because they're going to use them against you.
[01:55:18.699 --> 01:55:24.485]  They want to make sure that they're the only ones who are armed, that they have a monopoly on firepower, and that you can't defend yourself.
[01:55:24.986 --> 01:55:25.967]  They're going to go all out.
[01:55:27.463 --> 01:55:31.708]  What, you think they're going to be, you think if they take out Trump, you think they're going to say, okay, we're done.
[01:55:31.728 --> 01:55:35.813]  Now we're going to return to freedom of speech, a fair, free press.
[01:55:36.294 --> 01:55:38.056]  Everybody's, we're going to play fair now.
[01:55:38.337 --> 01:55:40.760]  We're not going to, from the left, rig the elections and so on.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:41.541]  You think they're going to do that?
[01:55:41.921 --> 01:55:42.442]  Not a chance.
[01:55:42.922 --> 01:55:45.324]  If they take out Trump, they're going to take out Pence next.
[01:55:45.624 --> 01:55:47.405]  They're going to take out every conservative.
[01:55:47.425 --> 01:55:50.227]  They're going to take out every Rand Paul in the Senate.
[01:55:50.787 --> 01:55:55.991]  They're going to take out every Christian, every Trump supporter, every gun owner, every independent media voice.
[01:55:56.311 --> 01:55:58.833]  And they're not going to stop at just censoring you and deplatforming you.
[01:55:59.313 --> 01:56:00.714]  They want to kill you.
[01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:02.155]  They want to murder you.
[01:56:02.175 --> 01:56:02.895]  I've said this before.
[01:56:03.576 --> 01:56:12.522]  You cannot coexist in a civil society with lawless, lunatic liars and deceivers, which is what the left has become.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:15.642]  I'm not getting any video right now from your studio.
[01:56:16.163 --> 01:56:18.585]  How's things going there?
[01:56:18.605 --> 01:56:20.607]  You know, I don't think things are going too well here.
[01:56:20.627 --> 01:56:21.688]  No one's even responding to me.
[01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:23.470]  I think the llamas have put people under a trance.
[01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:25.172]  I'm literally talking to my crew.
[01:56:25.212 --> 01:56:26.313]  They're like in trances.
[01:56:26.513 --> 01:56:27.614]  I'm not actually, I'm not kidding.
[01:56:27.934 --> 01:56:28.795]  Like magic powers.
[01:56:28.835 --> 01:56:30.517]  They will not even respond to me at this point.
[01:56:31.378 --> 01:56:32.479]  I was asking, I said, am I on air?
[01:56:32.499 --> 01:56:36.303]  And like eight people just are literally under mind control in there right now.
[01:56:36.343 --> 01:56:37.684]  This is actually kind of amazing.
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:41.401]  But you're gonna be lucky if the llamas don't eat all your video cameras, by the way.
[01:56:41.421 --> 01:56:42.062]  Actually, I'm not kidding.
[01:56:42.102 --> 01:56:43.662]  I mean, my crew got nerve gas.
[01:56:43.742 --> 01:56:45.543]  They're literally cannot talk.
[01:56:46.084 --> 01:56:47.204]  I went in there, they can't talk.
[01:56:47.264 --> 01:56:49.345]  Out here, they just looked at me and ran out of the room.
[01:56:49.785 --> 01:56:52.026]  This is... Do they have psychic powers or something?
[01:56:52.046 --> 01:56:54.107]  Because I'm not joking around here.
[01:56:54.287 --> 01:56:55.948]  I mean, the equipment's not working.
[01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:57.969]  None of my crew can talk now.
[01:56:58.469 --> 01:56:58.970]  This is insane.
[01:56:59.050 --> 01:56:59.930]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:01.611]  Oh my God.
[01:57:02.251 --> 01:57:03.432]  Are these really robot assassins?
[01:57:03.532 --> 01:57:04.672]  Oh my God, that one's coming at me right now.
[01:57:05.153 --> 01:57:05.533]  Stay with us.
[01:57:07.498 --> 01:57:13.462]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live and we just literally had llamas watching themselves on television in here.
[01:57:14.743 --> 01:57:19.306]  This is simply amazing to watch llamas in here.
[01:57:19.726 --> 01:57:21.788]  And you know, I did this to shake things up.
[01:57:22.924 --> 01:57:25.746]  Literally, the wireless mic wasn't hooked up.
[01:57:26.027 --> 01:57:26.527]  That's okay.
[01:57:27.127 --> 01:57:33.532]  Literally, people don't know what to do in the chaos of four llamas running around in my studio with hay and food and they're crapping on everything.
[01:57:33.813 --> 01:57:38.036]  But it doesn't matter, ladies and gentlemen, because we have to get out of our programming.
[01:57:38.496 --> 01:57:46.302]  That's why in corporate ads they put an emu or a lizard or a duck that talks, is because they want to get you out of your routine.
[01:57:47.183 --> 01:57:52.027]  I want to get you out of your routine of putting up with fluoride in the water that admittedly lowers your IQ and brain damages you.
[01:57:52.347 --> 01:57:56.810]  I want to get you out of routine with letting the left tell you how you can speak and what you can say.
[01:57:57.751 --> 01:58:01.233]  Twitter removes viral Biden meme posted by Trump.
[01:58:02.033 --> 01:58:04.555]  Talk show host tweeted by Trump on Fox News fired.
[01:58:05.476 --> 01:58:06.776]  Facebook suffers legal blow.
[01:58:06.916 --> 01:58:10.219]  EU says they can make them take down whatever they want, calling it hate speech.
[01:58:11.078 --> 01:58:11.719]  It goes on.
[01:58:12.341 --> 01:58:13.242]  All of the censorship.
[01:58:13.262 --> 01:58:13.783]  Censorship.
[01:58:13.803 --> 01:58:17.410]  DNC demands Facebook remove Trump campaign Biden Ukraine ad.
[01:58:17.831 --> 01:58:22.119]  Christian doctor of 30 years loses job for refusing to use transgender pronoun.
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:26.642]  Now they're saying Gandhi's bad and racist, the SJWs.
[01:58:27.423 --> 01:58:31.146]  Officers suspended for detaining suspected illegal alien after traffic incident.
[01:58:31.186 --> 01:58:32.588]  That's all up on NewsWars.com.
[01:58:32.968 --> 01:58:35.950]  Sweden undergoing demographic experiment of historical dimensions.
[01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:37.832]  Children taught to convert to Islam.
[01:58:38.252 --> 01:58:43.237]  Dems canceled charity event for officer killed in mass shooting over pro-Trump speakers.
[01:58:44.312 --> 01:58:48.754]  Hong Kong files charges on man shot for no reason by the police.
[01:58:49.635 --> 01:58:53.537]  Fashion designers speaking out against tyranny of PC culture.
[01:58:54.777 --> 01:58:55.398]  Trump Jr.
[01:58:55.438 --> 01:58:58.439]  dubs Adam Schiff the Jussie Smollett of Congress on steroids.
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.981]  But I'm doing it now with llamas.
[01:59:01.963 --> 01:59:04.766]  So now it's hitting parts of your brain that are seeing something new.
[01:59:05.326 --> 01:59:18.618]  You've seen Alex Jones for years tell you fluoride, and tell you about Jeffrey Epstein, and tell you about the New World Order, and fish infusion, and artificial black holes, and strangelets, and superconducting super colliders, and other systems, like cyclotrons.
[01:59:19.119 --> 01:59:21.501]  But you've ignored that because it's just all background.
[01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:22.902]  But now that I have llamas,
[01:59:24.033 --> 01:59:25.795]  Now that I have the secret weapon.
[01:59:26.496 --> 01:59:27.357]  This is amazing.
[01:59:27.417 --> 01:59:28.658]  Here you go, my sweetie.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:34.225]  Poco, which one's the really... Poco's the big one.
[01:59:34.645 --> 01:59:38.089]  Poco seems like... Can we get a close-up of Poco's face for TV viewers?
[01:59:38.129 --> 01:59:40.832]  Poco looks like he's kind of in master control over here.
[01:59:41.253 --> 01:59:43.315]  Now, it was Drew over here, one of our great camera guys.
[01:59:44.468 --> 01:59:45.989]  Who said, have you noticed this llama thing?
[01:59:46.009 --> 01:59:46.569]  And I said, no.
[01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:48.410]  But as soon as he said, you see llamas everywhere.
[01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:50.191]  There's llama keychains, llama toys.
[01:59:51.231 --> 01:59:54.933]  Suddenly I see my baby daughters always wearing llama shirts.
[01:59:54.953 --> 01:59:57.094]  There's llama, there's just llamas everywhere.
[01:59:57.134 --> 01:59:58.314]  Something's going on with llamas.
[01:59:58.714 --> 01:59:59.455]  Ladies, you own llamas.
[01:59:59.475 --> 02:00:00.555]  Have you noticed the llama mania?
[02:00:00.575 --> 02:00:05.437]  I mean, we're going to talk to you in a minute and get serious here about, because I've thought about getting a little piece of property outside Austin.
[02:00:05.738 --> 02:00:07.398]  We thought about what do we get for our ag exemption?
[02:00:07.518 --> 02:00:09.139]  Well, maybe a donkey, maybe a llama.
[02:00:09.779 --> 02:00:10.500]  Is this just poco?
[02:00:11.465 --> 02:00:12.446]  Poco, how you doing?
[02:00:12.866 --> 02:00:13.687]  Come on here, sweetie.
[02:00:13.927 --> 02:00:14.668]  Can I give you a cookie?
[02:00:15.429 --> 02:00:16.130]  Can I give you a cookie?
[02:00:17.311 --> 02:00:18.472]  Oh, come on, you want one of these.
[02:00:18.492 --> 02:00:19.613]  There's no fluoride in this.
[02:00:20.454 --> 02:00:22.616]  They don't want to brain damage you, so the government didn't put that in there.
[02:00:23.337 --> 02:00:24.478]  Come on, you want this?
[02:00:24.878 --> 02:00:27.360]  You don't trust... Oh, a cookie!
[02:00:28.121 --> 02:00:29.522]  That looks... Come on, I'm nice.
[02:00:30.646 --> 02:00:32.087]  You don't look like you've been missing any meals, though.
[02:00:32.927 --> 02:00:34.848]  Well, this is a very nice... It's smart.
[02:00:34.888 --> 02:00:37.590]  It isn't going to take food from a random person.
[02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:44.753]  Now, your child takes a vaccine made in China by globalists that swear they want to kill you, but that's okay.
[02:00:44.773 --> 02:00:49.996]  See, you're told to trust the system you don't know, but this llama would take a cookie from Mommy, wouldn't it?
[02:00:50.556 --> 02:00:55.919]  There, Mommy, come give... Come give the, uh, Poco, or whatever her name is, a cookie.
[02:00:55.939 --> 02:00:56.660]  See, now watch.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.721]  The llama runs away from me,
[02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:00.331]  Okay.
[02:01:00.972 --> 02:01:03.474]  But, you see, we'll probably take a cookie from Mommy.
[02:01:03.514 --> 02:01:12.222]  But we need to learn to not take cookies from strange Chai Com governments that make the fentanyl, the melamine for you.
[02:01:13.063 --> 02:01:15.205]  Mike Adams, would you like to... You didn't know this was happening today.
[02:01:15.225 --> 02:01:15.666]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:15.686 --> 02:01:16.166]  You're here.
[02:01:16.206 --> 02:01:17.808]  We're talking about the plan to assassinate the president.
[02:01:18.148 --> 02:01:20.911]  Everyone's going to listen now because we have the secret weapon.
[02:01:21.251 --> 02:01:22.372]  We have the llamas.
[02:01:22.652 --> 02:01:24.934]  It's kind of like Arby says, we have the meats.
[02:01:25.635 --> 02:01:26.235]  Well, guess what?
[02:01:26.295 --> 02:01:28.296]  We have the llamas, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:28.976 --> 02:01:29.976]  Mike Adams, National News.
[02:01:30.977 --> 02:01:33.217]  This is one day I wish I were there in studio.
[02:01:33.297 --> 02:01:35.238]  I'm really sorry I missed this in person.
[02:01:35.258 --> 02:01:37.899]  But, you know, you're talking to your audience today.
[02:01:37.939 --> 02:01:39.759]  I'm thinking you could reach all the liberals.
[02:01:39.819 --> 02:01:46.141]  You could put a unicorn horn on these animals and call them llama corns and have like flying rainbow llama corns.
[02:01:46.181 --> 02:01:48.102]  And then you could say anything you want to the leftists.
[02:01:50.023 --> 02:02:03.029]  Remember when somebody tweeted out four years ago, images of the Trump sons killing a Triceratops in Africa and millions retweeted, pissed that he killed an endangered animal, even though it's been dead for 25 million years?
[02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:03.669]  Here you go, sweetie.
[02:02:06.735 --> 02:02:11.698]  Well, I'm just wondering what you're going to do to up the ante beyond this, because this is pretty good stuff.
[02:02:12.859 --> 02:02:14.100]  What's next, Alex?
[02:02:14.681 --> 02:02:26.209]  I'll tell you what, let's cue up Trump's response that he did not want to put a moat around America with crocodiles and alligators, and then we're going to play a video where we found out where the Democrats actually got that idea for their new hoax.
[02:02:26.569 --> 02:02:31.072]  But getting serious before we go to that, why do you think they're tripling and quadrupling down on hoaxes?
[02:02:32.313 --> 02:02:33.373]  What do you think their endgame is?
[02:02:33.394 --> 02:02:35.395]  Because it's only discrediting them more, but they keep doing it.
[02:02:36.465 --> 02:02:49.174]  Well they know that it's about to, there's going to be sort of the mother of all bombshell document drops that's going to result in the criminal indictment of many of these deep staters and Democrat operatives.
[02:02:49.835 --> 02:02:51.176]  There's no question that that's coming.
[02:02:51.696 --> 02:02:55.779]  So the Democrats already know that this is the endgame for them.
[02:02:56.399 --> 02:03:04.205]  If they don't remove Trump very soon, probably within the next few months, the Democrats are going to be exposed, they're going to be defeated.
[02:03:04.801 --> 02:03:09.428]  They may be discredited for even a generation, depending on how much comes out here.
[02:03:09.828 --> 02:03:12.712]  Adam Schiff may be the one who ends up in prison.
[02:03:13.333 --> 02:03:17.860]  And other operatives, such as Brennan or McCabe or many others.
[02:03:18.943 --> 02:03:23.288]  Right now, they know that Trump is gunning for them and Barr has the goods.
[02:03:23.608 --> 02:03:30.556]  It's just a matter of Barr, I think, organizing it, making sure it's an open and shut case, that there are no holes in the entitlement.
[02:03:30.796 --> 02:03:32.818]  Well, Mike, let's get serious.
[02:03:33.018 --> 02:03:33.799]  I agree with you.
[02:03:33.819 --> 02:03:34.800]  We were texting last night.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:35.681]  Trump's got to take action.
[02:03:36.502 --> 02:03:37.463]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:03:37.483 --> 02:03:38.023]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:39.642 --> 02:03:44.306]  It's hard to be serious with this going on, but I think we've actually found the whistleblower that Schiff won't release.
[02:03:44.366 --> 02:03:45.527]  I think it's Poco.
[02:03:46.588 --> 02:03:46.988]  Did you?
[02:03:47.008 --> 02:03:48.490]  Are you the whistleblower?
[02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:52.233]  In fact, if Poco even knows who the whistleblower is, it's an attempt to kill the whistleblower.
[02:03:52.253 --> 02:03:55.295]  So I promise I'm not trying to kill this lovely llama here, but seriously,
[02:03:56.816 --> 02:04:02.698]  You believe, and I believe, there's a lot of evidence because Schiff would put out a fake report already, a fake transcript, that Schiff probably made this up.
[02:04:02.718 --> 02:04:08.460]  They now know that he had the letter days before it was sent to the Justice Department and to the Inspector General.
[02:04:08.821 --> 02:04:10.921]  And so I think you're right with your gut.
[02:04:10.941 --> 02:04:12.162]  A lot of folks are saying this now.
[02:04:12.702 --> 02:04:13.762]  In fact, we've seen Don Jr.
[02:04:13.782 --> 02:04:15.723]  last night after you were texting me saying you thought this.
[02:04:16.083 --> 02:04:16.643]  Don Jr.
[02:04:16.663 --> 02:04:19.504]  says that he's the Jussie Smollett of hoaxes.
[02:04:19.604 --> 02:04:22.025]  And so I think people now are onto the trail.
[02:04:22.045 --> 02:04:24.166]  This is probably made up by him and a few other people.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.421]  Yeah, it's interesting that Don Jr.
[02:04:27.461 --> 02:04:31.263]  came up with the same concept at the same time that you and I did, also independently.
[02:04:31.563 --> 02:04:35.405]  It was obvious that this guy Schiff is the Jussie Smollett of politics now.
[02:04:35.445 --> 02:04:46.870]  But remember, go back to that New York Times op-ed that they say was written by an insider close to the president in the White House that said, oh, we're all resisting Trump, you know, we're trying to get this guy out.
[02:04:47.351 --> 02:04:50.272]  I think the New York Times fabricated that person.
[02:04:50.954 --> 02:04:55.260]  And I think that Schiff is using the same tactic, and the Washington Post has done this before.
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:05:00.126]  Whenever they need someone to say something, they fabricate a person.
[02:05:00.807 --> 02:05:02.429]  And then they claim, you can't know who it is.
[02:05:02.890 --> 02:05:04.131]  And we're going to protect this person.
[02:05:04.392 --> 02:05:07.135]  The reason they have to protect them is because that person isn't real.
[02:05:07.155 --> 02:05:08.978]  It's a figment of their imagination.
[02:05:09.662 --> 02:05:10.843]  They're literally making it up.
[02:05:11.083 --> 02:05:23.950]  And by the way, when someone's been caught making up dossiers, making up fake transcripts, lying over and over again, saying, you know, I am Spartacus, I released a secret document, it wasn't even secret, that you have to say then, they made this up.
[02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:32.435]  I mean, it's like if your next door neighbor's robbed three banks, been in prison for ten years, gets out, and then a bank gets robbed and the description matches them, it probably is them, you know?
[02:05:32.855 --> 02:05:38.318]  I mean, so I think it's totally reasonable to say that Schiff staged this, so why would he be in such a desperate mode right now?
[02:05:39.761 --> 02:05:41.622]  Well, again, now he has to double down and triple down.
[02:05:41.662 --> 02:05:43.003]  This is what they do when they get caught.
[02:05:43.364 --> 02:05:46.706]  They can't admit at any point that, oh yeah, they made it all up, they lied.
[02:05:46.846 --> 02:05:47.506]  They can't do that.
[02:05:47.587 --> 02:05:54.712]  So they have to keep going and hope for a hail Mary kind of, you know, random victory where they could get Trump out for some reason.
[02:05:54.732 --> 02:06:02.257]  I mean, look, they were hoping that Trump's call with the Ukrainian president was going to be filled with all kinds of impeachable offenses.
[02:06:02.757 --> 02:06:08.684]  Because then the reason the Democrats believed that that would happen was because that's what the Democrats would have done on those calls.
[02:06:08.964 --> 02:06:15.812]  Remember yesterday, Alex, in studio with you there, I was saying, let's see the transcripts of all of Barack Obama's phone calls.
[02:06:16.562 --> 02:06:19.164]  Let's see the 30,000 emails from Hillary Clinton.
[02:06:19.484 --> 02:06:20.885]  Let's see all of Joe Biden's phone calls.
[02:06:21.365 --> 02:06:33.692]  I mean, let's, I mean, if we're going to go full public, full transparency, let's see all of it because I guarantee you what the Democrats were doing was criminal, impeachable activities routinely.
[02:06:33.712 --> 02:06:36.353]  Hey, where do the llamas like to be petted?
[02:06:37.374 --> 02:06:37.854]  On the neck.
[02:06:37.934 --> 02:06:39.015]  Okay, you're good.
[02:06:40.296 --> 02:06:42.357]  Oh, I got a friend now.
[02:06:44.687 --> 02:06:45.667]  Who's hosting the 4th Hour?
[02:06:45.687 --> 02:06:46.668]  Can you guys tell me that?
[02:06:48.488 --> 02:06:49.109]  Matt Bracken.
[02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:51.089]  Well, Matt will enjoy a toast with these llamas.
[02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:54.611]  But Mike, I'm glad you're a smart guy and I'm not kissing your butt.
[02:06:54.631 --> 02:06:54.831]  It's true.
[02:06:54.851 --> 02:06:56.311]  I mean, you get psychological.
[02:06:56.331 --> 02:06:58.392]  I'm doing this to point out how they do this.
[02:06:59.192 --> 02:07:00.453]  How they'll sell things.
[02:07:02.150 --> 02:07:06.591]  By putting something in there to totally change the subject in the brain, to get people out of their regular patterns.
[02:07:07.191 --> 02:07:13.533]  And I think it's healthy to do that, for people to think about what's going on with the whole globalist system, and just how much danger we're in.
[02:07:14.053 --> 02:07:21.215]  How many people are already dying from the globalist eugenics onslaught, and now China has been allowed to literally gang-rape this nation, and now Trump's saying no.
[02:07:21.235 --> 02:07:21.955]  Where do you think that's going?
[02:07:21.975 --> 02:07:27.956]  We'll do a few more minutes with Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com, Alex Jones, and these llamas were brought to you by InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:07:28.216 --> 02:07:30.057]  We've got mega-sales going that are about to end.
[02:07:30.077 --> 02:07:30.957]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:35.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:07:35.311 --> 02:07:36.532]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:07:37.132 --> 02:07:39.673]  And I just told the crew, I need a cup of coffee, make it hot.
[02:07:40.254 --> 02:07:43.915]  I need a big old needle, an injector needle, and a llama.
[02:07:45.356 --> 02:07:46.677]  Go into a show!
[02:07:46.697 --> 02:07:49.138]  Ha ha!
[02:07:52.199 --> 02:07:53.580]  Playin' rock and roll!
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:57.422]  It's a long way to the top if you want to warn people about the eugenics operation.
[02:07:58.677 --> 02:07:59.518]  But we're doing it right now.
[02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.100]  They're not going to stop us.
[02:08:01.561 --> 02:08:02.602]  You can't have a weirder scene.
[02:08:02.622 --> 02:08:04.405]  You've got Don Jr.
[02:08:04.425 --> 02:08:06.548]  who killed a 25-million-year-old Triceratops.
[02:08:06.908 --> 02:08:09.432]  That went total viral how he killed an endangered species.
[02:08:09.672 --> 02:08:10.673]  The left actually believed it.
[02:08:11.798 --> 02:08:15.502]  And then we've got right here four llamas, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:15.522 --> 02:08:18.245]  And now that I've been petting them properly, pet the neck, not the ear.
[02:08:18.285 --> 02:08:19.026]  These aren't like horses.
[02:08:19.347 --> 02:08:20.308]  They're now in love with me.
[02:08:21.209 --> 02:08:22.750]  Absolutely in love with me right now.
[02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:23.952]  Mike Adams riding shotgun.
[02:08:24.653 --> 02:08:27.195]  And we're doing this to explain how things really work.
[02:08:28.096 --> 02:08:30.679]  I was saying, hey, let's give these llamas some fluoride water.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:31.720]  I don't know.
[02:08:51.178 --> 02:08:53.660]  Why don't we just, you know, give them their vaccines?
[02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:57.824]  You know, I work for a large animal vet and he said, no, the vaccines kill all the dogs and cats.
[02:08:58.184 --> 02:09:02.608]  Back when he was a small animal vet and he recommended people not even giving it to them and said maybe rabies.
[02:09:02.648 --> 02:09:07.392]  But ma'am, tell us a little bit about these llamas and have you ever had a gig like this with your llamas?
[02:09:07.412 --> 02:09:10.995]  Tell us about your company, who you are and some of the strangest gigs you've ever had.
[02:09:11.383 --> 02:09:11.804]  Oh boy.
[02:09:12.925 --> 02:09:14.327]  I'm from Leslie Lane Llamas.
[02:09:15.468 --> 02:09:16.449]  These are my boys here.
[02:09:17.431 --> 02:09:21.636]  Some of our gigs, we do a lot of weddings, we do nursing homes, we do... These are boys?
[02:09:21.956 --> 02:09:23.458]  I thought those were girls.
[02:09:23.498 --> 02:09:24.980]  Does that mean I'm gay?
[02:09:25.701 --> 02:09:25.981]  Okay.
[02:09:26.181 --> 02:09:27.443]  No, they're castrated males.
[02:09:27.523 --> 02:09:28.224]  Two of them are.
[02:09:28.304 --> 02:09:28.884]  Two of them are.
[02:09:28.904 --> 02:09:29.565]  So they're eunuchs.
[02:09:29.866 --> 02:09:30.847]  Oh, they're trans!
[02:09:31.607 --> 02:09:32.668]  Well, no.
[02:09:33.068 --> 02:09:34.729]  Well, some of them are castrated.
[02:09:34.809 --> 02:09:36.731]  Don't use the wrong pronoun or I'll have to arrest you, ma'am.
[02:09:37.171 --> 02:09:37.451]  Sorry.
[02:09:37.471 --> 02:09:37.992]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:09:38.432 --> 02:09:38.632]  Okay.
[02:09:39.052 --> 02:09:41.074]  So, two of them are still males.
[02:09:41.234 --> 02:09:42.715]  Two of them are castrated males.
[02:09:43.215 --> 02:09:44.196]  We castrate... Geldings.
[02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:44.857]  Geldings.
[02:09:44.917 --> 02:09:45.197]  Yes.
[02:09:45.537 --> 02:09:45.797]  Yes.
[02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:46.918]  Like horses.
[02:09:46.978 --> 02:09:47.519]  The new man.
[02:09:47.799 --> 02:09:48.319]  The new man.
[02:09:48.539 --> 02:09:48.759]  Yes.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:49.800]  It relaxes them.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:52.842]  So they're not so... Good.
[02:09:52.882 --> 02:09:53.523]  That's what I need.
[02:09:54.909 --> 02:09:58.732]  But we need that when they're working around people and senior citizens and kids.
[02:09:58.752 --> 02:10:00.714]  We don't need this high-strung, cocky men.
[02:10:00.754 --> 02:10:01.654]  We don't need wars anymore.
[02:10:01.674 --> 02:10:02.235]  We don't need men.
[02:10:02.395 --> 02:10:02.855]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:02.956 --> 02:10:04.217]  Right, not in the llama community.
[02:10:04.337 --> 02:10:10.482]  I mean, I have my breeders who need to be men, but... Only rare studs get to, you know, that's how, yeah.
[02:10:10.642 --> 02:10:11.502]  The chosen ones.
[02:10:11.562 --> 02:10:13.264]  The chosen one to raise the stud.
[02:10:13.504 --> 02:10:15.646]  So are these, is this a prized stud right here?
[02:10:16.006 --> 02:10:16.747]  No, he's a gelding.
[02:10:16.887 --> 02:10:17.387]  He's a gelding?
[02:10:17.427 --> 02:10:18.688]  So which one of these is a stud?
[02:10:18.708 --> 02:10:19.489]  This one?
[02:10:19.829 --> 02:10:20.650]  This is a stud right here?
[02:10:22.433 --> 02:10:23.273]  How's it going, stud?
[02:10:23.754 --> 02:10:26.016]  Now, but getting serious, tell me about the well water.
[02:10:26.036 --> 02:10:26.957]  You don't want to give them fluoride water?
[02:10:26.977 --> 02:10:27.978]  We don't give them fluoride water.
[02:10:27.998 --> 02:10:28.758]  We give them well water.
[02:10:29.219 --> 02:10:29.879]  Oh, why not?
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:36.686]  We don't want any of the purities, the chlorine, the additives, all the things that they put in there.
[02:10:36.826 --> 02:10:38.988]  Oh, you want to be able to get other llamas pregnant?
[02:10:39.708 --> 02:10:40.049]  Yeah.
[02:10:40.449 --> 02:10:40.649]  Yeah?
[02:10:40.829 --> 02:10:41.090]  Yeah.
[02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:44.473]  Everybody I know that race horses or anything say you just don't give them fluoride water.
[02:10:44.909 --> 02:10:45.630]  Right.
[02:10:45.730 --> 02:10:48.012]  So you've been told that, you know that?
[02:10:48.172 --> 02:10:48.733]  Yeah, 19 years.
[02:10:49.354 --> 02:10:52.157]  My whole business career, they've only ever had well water.
[02:10:52.777 --> 02:10:54.679]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:55.961]  Mike Adams is a farmer.
[02:10:56.001 --> 02:10:57.542]  He's got llamas and sheep.
[02:10:57.943 --> 02:11:00.786]  Mike, tell us, I'm sure you know the same thing, right?
[02:11:01.927 --> 02:11:06.071]  Well, yeah, I have goats and I have donkeys that we rescued from the fires.
[02:11:06.652 --> 02:11:07.473]  Are you llamaphobic?
[02:11:09.714 --> 02:11:15.619]  I haven't been around llamas since I was in South America, but at that time... Oh, you claim you've got llama friends.
[02:11:15.699 --> 02:11:21.204]  You've got lots of llama friends, but... Bring me the needle, please.
[02:11:21.804 --> 02:11:24.767]  I mean, they drink from tanks, you know, pond water, basically.
[02:11:24.867 --> 02:11:27.910]  So that's rainwater, which is clean water, yeah.
[02:11:27.970 --> 02:11:30.992]  City water will kill every living system eventually.
[02:11:31.753 --> 02:11:32.954]  Yeah, if you put fish in it, they die.
[02:11:33.675 --> 02:11:34.896]  But give it to your children.
[02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:37.490]  Ma'am, you are awesome.
[02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:38.631]  We're going to go to break, but I want to hear more.
[02:11:38.691 --> 02:11:41.012]  What's the website if people want to have llamas dropped by their house?
[02:11:41.833 --> 02:11:43.333]  LeslieLaneLlamas.com.
[02:11:45.394 --> 02:11:46.455]  Leslie Lane Llamas.
[02:11:46.515 --> 02:11:48.476]  Don't worry, I'm not going to give your llama a shot.
[02:11:49.576 --> 02:11:52.938]  I just, I just, I got a feeling, though, if I come at it with this needle, it's going to run away.
[02:11:52.958 --> 02:11:53.999]  It is?
[02:11:54.099 --> 02:11:54.359]  It is.
[02:11:55.259 --> 02:11:58.761]  But what if I, what if I was a Chinese government and I was known to put cancer viruses in it?
[02:11:59.501 --> 02:12:00.642]  Shouldn't I just give it cancer?
[02:12:00.662 --> 02:12:01.282]  No.
[02:12:01.642 --> 02:12:02.043]  Please no.
[02:12:02.063 --> 02:12:02.583]  Fluoride, please.
[02:12:02.783 --> 02:12:02.923]  No.
[02:12:03.643 --> 02:12:04.384]  What about glyphosate?
[02:12:05.282 --> 02:12:06.004]  I don't even know what that is.
[02:12:06.124 --> 02:12:07.428]  Oh, you don't know about Roundup?
[02:12:07.448 --> 02:12:08.190]  How good it is for you?
[02:12:08.491 --> 02:12:08.852]  Oh, no.
[02:12:09.053 --> 02:12:09.374]  No, no.
[02:12:09.655 --> 02:12:10.738]  We don't use Roundup on our products.
[02:12:10.758 --> 02:12:11.641]  You don't want to die?
[02:12:12.881 --> 02:12:17.445]  I got a buddy, well-known musician, not going to name-drop, but he's got a nice place out in Blanco.
[02:12:17.705 --> 02:12:27.773]  It's actually the ranch he's got, it's right next to one that John Wayne used to have, but they got the ranch and it's got the biggest llama I've ever seen, this big giant dark brown one, and they got a bunch of little Spanish donkeys too, it's the first thing you've ever seen.
[02:12:27.793 --> 02:12:30.655]  But you were saying that's pretty common, people kind of inherit llamas with their ranches?
[02:12:30.695 --> 02:12:35.158]  Yeah, a lot of times people sell their ranches and they don't know what to do with the llamas, so they leave it for the new owners.
[02:12:36.325 --> 02:12:38.448]  Well, I just figure there's all this really heavy news.
[02:12:38.889 --> 02:12:41.592]  China's got thousands of missiles now that can blow the U.S.
[02:12:41.672 --> 02:12:45.498]  up because the Clintons gave it to them and, you know, openly they're saying kill Trump all over the news.
[02:12:45.598 --> 02:12:47.260]  I thought we'd just shake it up and have some llamas.
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:48.762]  I just think what else can we do, you know?
[02:12:48.782 --> 02:12:49.723]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:12:49.763 --> 02:12:50.725]  Everybody loves llamas.
[02:12:51.366 --> 02:12:52.587]  You know, Drew over here...
[02:12:53.476 --> 02:12:55.717]  One of the great camera guys, he was saying, have you noticed all this llama manning?
[02:12:55.737 --> 02:12:56.378]  And I said, no.
[02:12:56.398 --> 02:12:57.018]  He goes, look.
[02:12:57.419 --> 02:12:59.100]  Once I started looking, there's llama stuff everywhere.
[02:12:59.340 --> 02:12:59.700]  Everywhere.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:03.162]  Sheets, blankets, cups, t-shirts, pajamas.
[02:13:04.043 --> 02:13:10.087]  I remember like 30 years ago, 35 years ago, people trying to sell my grandmother in East Texas on an emu carriage, emu farms.
[02:13:10.407 --> 02:13:11.368]  That didn't go anywhere.
[02:13:12.048 --> 02:13:12.228]  No.
[02:13:13.129 --> 02:13:13.289]  No.
[02:13:13.689 --> 02:13:17.171]  They're not very friendly, like llamas can be friendly.
[02:13:17.511 --> 02:13:22.295]  In fact, why didn't that insurance company, Liberty Mutual, get a llama or something?
[02:13:23.729 --> 02:13:23.949]  Right.
[02:13:23.969 --> 02:13:24.609]  He should have an emu.
[02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:25.330]  Exactly.
[02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:26.250]  Exactly.
[02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:28.251]  We could have made a great commercial with the llamas.
[02:13:28.731 --> 02:13:30.292]  I'm calling it, the llama's mine.
[02:13:31.633 --> 02:13:33.614]  Now, let's talk about this.
[02:13:33.654 --> 02:13:41.637]  I'm not going to do anything to the llama, but I think that we should give children at birth 60 shots, even though it'll kill them.
[02:13:42.398 --> 02:13:45.459]  But the government says it won't hurt them, even though on the insert it says it'll kill them.
[02:13:45.919 --> 02:13:53.023]  And I'm just wondering why we shouldn't, I mean, have you been giving your llamas their shots?
[02:13:53.976 --> 02:14:02.362]  We give the basic minimums that the vet needs us to have so that they don't get sick, and it's been proven in the gamelit industry.
[02:14:02.643 --> 02:14:02.863]  Sure.
[02:14:03.083 --> 02:14:06.145]  I don't want them dying, so I have to... No, no, I mean there are some vaccines that actually work.
[02:14:06.165 --> 02:14:13.351]  I'm not saying the technology doesn't work, but when you get to like 60 or so, it's been proven human life expectancy is dropping in every country that has over 10 vaccines.
[02:14:13.511 --> 02:14:14.111]  Right, right.
[02:14:14.151 --> 02:14:15.012]  They get one a year.
[02:14:15.492 --> 02:14:15.632]  Yeah.
[02:14:16.733 --> 02:14:19.475]  Also, nobody wants to spike the llama stuff with anything.
[02:14:19.495 --> 02:14:22.297]  Do you trust China that makes 90% of our vaccines?
[02:14:22.658 --> 02:14:22.738]  No.
[02:14:23.806 --> 02:14:24.166]  No, no, no.
[02:14:24.446 --> 02:14:26.347]  I like my American companies.
[02:14:26.807 --> 02:14:30.689]  Well, I'd like you to just have a few minutes to talk about your llamas, and I'm gonna go get a copy of a book right here.
[02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:31.329]  It's actually right here.
[02:14:32.349 --> 02:14:33.190]  You can read it online for free.
[02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:40.712]  This is written by the Chinese military, Unrestricted Warfare, and it talks about how they ship heroin into the U.S.
[02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:45.534]  to take us down, and how they also spike and poison the medicines that are made there.
[02:14:45.854 --> 02:14:47.215]  This is actually put out by their military.
[02:14:47.955 --> 02:14:52.777]  I wonder why our government, Trump's trying to stop it, I wonder why our government ships all that in here then, I mean, under Obama.
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:54.861]  Unrestricted warfare, folks.
[02:14:54.881 --> 02:14:57.404]  I know it's pretty heavy.
[02:14:57.704 --> 02:14:58.806]  You've probably never come somewhere.
[02:14:59.066 --> 02:14:59.907]  Tell me the type of events.
[02:15:00.087 --> 02:15:00.788]  Take over for a few minutes.
[02:15:01.048 --> 02:15:02.329]  Tell me about your business.
[02:15:03.771 --> 02:15:05.493]  Your business has your cool name on it.
[02:15:05.813 --> 02:15:07.435]  And how you got into llamas and some of the things you do.
[02:15:08.516 --> 02:15:08.757]  Oh boy.
[02:15:08.997 --> 02:15:10.579]  Okay, so... You're now hosting international press.
[02:15:12.185 --> 02:15:13.605]  Okay, so don't walk away from me.
[02:15:14.125 --> 02:15:21.347]  So I got into llamas because I wanted a horse farm and we had a coyote problem.
[02:15:21.487 --> 02:15:26.168]  So somebody told me to get some llamas that they'll keep the coyotes out of my pasture.
[02:15:26.268 --> 02:15:33.370]  So we bought two llamas and got to watch them actually guard and chase the coyotes and the dogs out of my horse pasture.
[02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.830]  Pretty exciting.
[02:15:34.130 --> 02:15:34.610]  It was!
[02:15:34.630 --> 02:15:36.170]  So these guys can be pretty mean.
[02:15:36.711 --> 02:15:37.251]  They can be.
[02:15:37.291 --> 02:15:38.591]  They protect their own.
[02:15:38.971 --> 02:15:40.392]  You know, they stand up for each other.
[02:15:40.412 --> 02:15:41.212]  That's not good.
[02:15:41.673 --> 02:15:50.497]  So as soon as I saw the female llama chase the dogs out of the pasture and the gelding bring the baby down to the barn, I knew then I needed more llamas.
[02:15:50.757 --> 02:15:52.999]  That's what I was told by my buddy that's got some out in Blanco.
[02:15:53.019 --> 02:15:58.662]  He just said that he's got a bunch of donkeys, and they can run off cows too, but this big llama chases the cows.
[02:15:59.042 --> 02:16:00.042]  They don't even come around anymore.
[02:16:00.422 --> 02:16:01.203]  Correct, correct.
[02:16:01.263 --> 02:16:04.925]  Yeah, we have 65 llamas and we don't have a coyote problem.
[02:16:05.973 --> 02:16:06.233]  At all.
[02:16:06.554 --> 02:16:09.457]  So what do they do to try to, like, hit him with their front hooves?
[02:16:09.477 --> 02:16:11.660]  Well, first they're gonna chase him and they're gonna spit at him.
[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:15.064]  So that's where the whole spitting thing comes into play.
[02:16:15.404 --> 02:16:18.308]  They spit to protect themselves and to chase the bad guys away.
[02:16:18.328 --> 02:16:19.029]  What does the spit do?
[02:16:19.049 --> 02:16:19.930]  It's not like a cobra.
[02:16:20.791 --> 02:16:25.193]  No, so if they spit on us, it does nothing.
[02:16:25.293 --> 02:16:32.816]  If they spit on a canine, like a coyote or a dog, it numbs their mouth like Novocaine for about 15 minutes, so they can't bite.
[02:16:32.836 --> 02:16:33.796]  So there is some type of thing in it.
[02:16:34.297 --> 02:16:37.358]  Is there a signal to get them to spit on me?
[02:16:37.758 --> 02:16:38.238]  I don't mind.
[02:16:39.779 --> 02:16:41.000]  I don't teach my llamas to spit.
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:41.900]  This will go viral.
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.240]  Stick them.
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.360]  Stick them.
[02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:45.521]  I don't teach the llamas to spit on command.
[02:16:49.724 --> 02:16:51.705]  I do this for the massive ratings, I guess.
[02:16:52.346 --> 02:16:57.289]  No, I suppose that little one over there would be the first one to spit on you if you did something.
[02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:58.710]  Well, I don't want to be mean to her.
[02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.571]  Well, see, that's the problem.
[02:17:00.691 --> 02:17:02.092]  You know, you have to do something to annoy her.
[02:17:02.112 --> 02:17:03.653]  What if I come at it like it's a newborn baby?
[02:17:04.573 --> 02:17:06.755]  With, say, hepatitis shot that babies don't even need that's deadly.
[02:17:09.144 --> 02:17:11.046]  Oh, you stick him with that and he's going to spit at you.
[02:17:11.066 --> 02:17:14.209]  Well, I only do that to babies if it was Chinese poison.
[02:17:14.229 --> 02:17:15.310]  We wouldn't want to hurt the lamb.
[02:17:15.330 --> 02:17:16.411]  We only do that to baby humans.
[02:17:17.753 --> 02:17:18.514]  I'm not a barbarian.
[02:17:19.455 --> 02:17:20.436]  What's the little one's name again?
[02:17:20.456 --> 02:17:21.617]  That's Groot.
[02:17:22.418 --> 02:17:22.758]  Groot?
[02:17:22.958 --> 02:17:23.279]  Groot.
[02:17:23.519 --> 02:17:25.281]  Oh, like Groot from Guardian of the Galaxy?
[02:17:25.461 --> 02:17:26.922]  And Rocket Raccoon.
[02:17:27.163 --> 02:17:27.883]  I'll come over here.
[02:17:27.903 --> 02:17:29.165]  I don't want to stampede him.
[02:17:29.185 --> 02:17:31.187]  I don't want to get spit on here.
[02:17:32.185 --> 02:17:34.106]  Again, the globalists want to assassinate Trump.
[02:17:34.626 --> 02:17:35.947]  It's an emergency transmission.
[02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.247]  Only the llamas can save you.
[02:17:37.387 --> 02:17:38.168]  Newswars.com.
[02:17:38.208 --> 02:17:39.008]  Newswars.com.
[02:17:39.268 --> 02:17:46.291]  Don't go to Van Duff again.
[02:17:46.331 --> 02:17:47.192]  I'm not too scary.
[02:17:47.212 --> 02:17:52.014]  I kind of look like Jocelyn Elders trying to teach three-year-olds how to masturbate.
[02:17:52.974 --> 02:17:55.616]  Reach down, helpful little child.
[02:17:55.696 --> 02:17:56.116]  Hello.
[02:17:56.136 --> 02:17:57.236]  Alright, it's not scary to me.
[02:17:57.256 --> 02:17:57.857]  He knows I'm nice.
[02:17:57.897 --> 02:17:58.637]  No, he's got it for you.
[02:17:58.657 --> 02:17:59.117]  I can't get it.
[02:17:59.137 --> 02:18:00.598]  Mike Adams, how do I get him to spit on me?
[02:18:02.116 --> 02:18:05.098]  Well, you would have to pretend to be a coyote.
[02:18:05.439 --> 02:18:07.900]  Ma'am, this lady's looking at me like I'm completely insane.
[02:18:08.441 --> 02:18:09.582]  And yes, ma'am, I am insane.
[02:18:09.602 --> 02:18:10.062]  How you doing?
[02:18:11.143 --> 02:18:11.763]  Hi, what's your name?
[02:18:11.943 --> 02:18:12.244]  Linda.
[02:18:12.604 --> 02:18:12.884]  Linda?
[02:18:13.405 --> 02:18:15.086]  Have you ever been someplace this strange in your whole life?
[02:18:16.367 --> 02:18:17.308]  Actually, stranger.
[02:18:17.688 --> 02:18:18.148]  Really?
[02:18:19.089 --> 02:18:19.669]  Tell me about it.
[02:18:21.010 --> 02:18:21.971]  Um... Probably can't.
[02:18:22.351 --> 02:18:22.972]  No, I can't.
[02:18:23.352 --> 02:18:26.134]  Time that flying saucer landed and all those... all those clowns came off?
[02:18:26.334 --> 02:18:26.675]  That's it.
[02:18:27.355 --> 02:18:27.795]  You were there.
[02:18:28.476 --> 02:18:29.116]  That was me, ma'am.
[02:18:29.397 --> 02:18:29.557]  Okay.
[02:18:30.598 --> 02:18:30.898]  So, uh...
[02:18:33.416 --> 02:18:33.957]  Now you understand.
[02:18:33.977 --> 02:18:34.357]  That's right.
[02:18:34.477 --> 02:18:34.817]  I get it.
[02:18:36.779 --> 02:18:37.279]  You're pretty cool.
[02:18:37.299 --> 02:18:37.900]  Where are you from?
[02:18:38.761 --> 02:18:39.041]  Austin.
[02:18:39.421 --> 02:18:40.002]  That's awesome.
[02:18:40.602 --> 02:18:41.763]  Not a lot of folks from Austin.
[02:18:42.104 --> 02:18:43.405]  Oh, originally I'm from Minneapolis.
[02:18:43.605 --> 02:18:45.046]  Minneapolis, that's cool up there.
[02:18:45.266 --> 02:18:45.587]  It is.
[02:18:45.707 --> 02:18:46.627]  Literally and figuratively.
[02:18:46.708 --> 02:18:47.208]  Exactly.
[02:18:47.408 --> 02:18:48.069]  Somalia now.
[02:18:49.710 --> 02:18:51.912]  Got snow in northern Minnesota yesterday.
[02:18:51.972 --> 02:18:54.314]  Did you know I wrote a hit song, got seen like 40 million times?
[02:18:55.355 --> 02:18:56.876]  Oh, that's as big as some of Elvis's biggest ones.
[02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:58.430]  You ever heard of it?
[02:18:58.731 --> 02:19:00.792]  We love our Somalis.
[02:19:01.152 --> 02:19:02.913]  We love our Muslims, too.
[02:19:03.474 --> 02:19:04.634]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:19:04.654 --> 02:19:05.955]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:19:06.415 --> 02:19:09.077]  I love my llama, too.
[02:19:09.097 --> 02:19:11.639]  Oh, my llama's so good.
[02:19:11.659 --> 02:19:14.260]  I need my llama today.
[02:19:14.561 --> 02:19:17.022]  There's nothing better than a llama say.
[02:19:17.382 --> 02:19:19.924]  That's why we got llamas.
[02:19:20.364 --> 02:19:22.145]  We love our llamas.
[02:19:22.365 --> 02:19:24.147]  So you don't care how you look, you have a lot of fun.
[02:19:25.227 --> 02:19:26.228]  Now, is that the worst thing you've ever seen?
[02:19:27.481 --> 02:19:27.681]  Yeah.
[02:19:28.882 --> 02:19:33.106]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what it's all about.
[02:19:33.726 --> 02:19:36.068]  I can see some of the crews really enjoying this back there.
[02:19:37.689 --> 02:19:38.610]  How's it going, ladies?
[02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:39.251]  Is this good?
[02:19:40.392 --> 02:19:41.933]  Some of the people look very, very serious.
[02:19:41.953 --> 02:19:45.856]  She doesn't like it.
[02:19:46.937 --> 02:19:48.798]  Anyways, got my Russian handlers in there.
[02:19:49.619 --> 02:19:51.441]  All right, folks, we got to get really serious here.
[02:19:52.501 --> 02:19:53.963]  Mike Adams, what do you think of this situation?
[02:19:55.885 --> 02:19:59.366]  Well, again, I just wonder what you're going to do tomorrow to up this.
[02:19:59.406 --> 02:20:00.387]  This is good stuff.
[02:20:01.167 --> 02:20:02.868]  Put some names on them.
[02:20:03.108 --> 02:20:05.089]  Make them be Obama's llamas or something.
[02:20:05.149 --> 02:20:08.650]  I mean, start giving them names of politicians and see what they have to say.
[02:20:08.850 --> 02:20:09.510]  Absolutely.
[02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:10.871]  So which one's Peter Schiff?
[02:20:11.591 --> 02:20:12.892]  I mean, not Peter Schiff.
[02:20:13.632 --> 02:20:14.852]  That's the economist guy.
[02:20:14.932 --> 02:20:15.513]  Adam Schiff.
[02:20:15.533 --> 02:20:16.373]  Which one's Adam Schiff?
[02:20:19.775 --> 02:20:21.596]  I gotta tell you, Mike, what a weird background.
[02:20:21.616 --> 02:20:26.519]  We've got a Triceratops and that horrible butcher Don King, Don King, Donald Jr.
[02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.770]  I met Don Jr.
[02:20:28.810 --> 02:20:30.031]  and Don King on the same day once.
[02:20:30.471 --> 02:20:32.332]  And then, literally, at the RNC.
[02:20:32.492 --> 02:20:34.614]  And then you've also got the triceratops back there.
[02:20:34.634 --> 02:20:36.114]  You can't top that weirdness right now, can you?
[02:20:36.635 --> 02:20:39.076]  The shift llama is the one with the long pencil deck.
[02:20:39.156 --> 02:20:39.756]  That's the answer.
[02:20:40.216 --> 02:20:40.677]  Exactly.
[02:20:40.697 --> 02:20:44.859]  All right, we got former Navy SEAL bestselling author Matt Bracken taking over about serious issues.
[02:20:44.879 --> 02:20:48.741]  But I wanted to break in here and just break the paradigm, break the internet, do something new.
[02:20:49.181 --> 02:20:50.282]  Only thing weirder could be like...
[02:20:51.022 --> 02:20:55.846]  Midgets on PCP hang gliding through the office right now, but that has not happened.
[02:20:55.886 --> 02:20:57.847]  So we are here with the llamas.
[02:20:57.867 --> 02:20:59.068]  These ladies are great.
[02:21:00.189 --> 02:21:01.991]  These are, you call yourselves llama wranglers?
[02:21:04.392 --> 02:21:06.194]  Hit them up, wrap them in and grab them out.
[02:21:06.214 --> 02:21:07.395]  We're all hud.
[02:21:08.175 --> 02:21:10.197]  We're very gentle with our animals.
[02:21:13.257 --> 02:21:17.841]  No, they're just, you know, you want to be calm and treat them like, with dignity.
[02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:19.002]  That one's really cute over there.
[02:21:19.082 --> 02:21:20.123]  Looks a little sneaky though.
[02:21:20.143 --> 02:21:21.183]  There's something sneaky about them.
[02:21:22.825 --> 02:21:25.046]  And I guess they're originally from the Andes Mountains?
[02:21:25.407 --> 02:21:25.587]  Mm-hmm.
[02:21:26.067 --> 02:21:26.267]  Yep.
[02:21:26.668 --> 02:21:28.569]  Peru, South America areas.
[02:21:28.729 --> 02:21:28.990]  Uh-huh.
[02:21:29.730 --> 02:21:33.393]  And are you peaked out at 60 llamas?
[02:21:33.413 --> 02:21:34.834]  No, I have a bunch of babies coming.
[02:21:36.856 --> 02:21:36.916]  Oh!
[02:21:40.345 --> 02:21:44.187]  No llamas were hurt in this transmission because they weren't given any vaccines or fluoride water.
[02:21:44.927 --> 02:21:47.808]  But hey, nobody gives it to their horses or llamas because it'll kill them.
[02:21:47.848 --> 02:21:48.888]  Give your children fluoride.
[02:21:49.168 --> 02:21:50.149]  Give your children fluoride.
[02:21:50.449 --> 02:21:51.049]  Give it to them.
[02:21:51.569 --> 02:21:52.450]  Do what the government says.
[02:21:54.130 --> 02:21:55.971]  All right, Matt Bracken has taken over.
[02:21:56.431 --> 02:22:03.534]  And the reason I did this today is, again, you see all these ads where they'll have like a talking duck, or they'll have an emu, or they'll have a lizard.
[02:22:04.534 --> 02:22:08.176]  And that's to get people out of their routine and get them to, you know, pay attention.
[02:22:09.531 --> 02:22:12.932]  And so if I gotta bring you llamas in studio to get that done, I will.
[02:22:12.953 --> 02:22:19.695]  But imagine 10 million military-age men the last eight years into Europe, given free welfare, allowed to rape and kill whoever they want.
[02:22:19.715 --> 02:22:26.659]  So if you think my office is a little freaked out with four nice llamas running around, imagine what it's like to be in Europe with the Islamic invasion.
[02:22:27.959 --> 02:22:30.520]  So that's what this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:33.021]  So there's a lot of different angles to this.
[02:22:33.101 --> 02:22:35.903]  But, you know, should they become a regular fixture here?
[02:22:36.383 --> 02:22:36.883]  I don't know.
[02:22:36.983 --> 02:22:38.044]  Who's gonna be in here tomorrow?
[02:22:38.404 --> 02:22:38.844]  I don't know.
[02:22:40.632 --> 02:22:44.395]  But there is somewhat of a llama mania going on that's really been unannounced.
[02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:47.717]  So I'm officially, you know, the American flag is one of our logos.
[02:22:47.737 --> 02:22:48.497]  You know, we like that.
[02:22:48.938 --> 02:22:50.158]  I like the Christian cross.
[02:22:50.819 --> 02:22:52.520]  And you know, I just like Texas.
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:53.280]  I love Texas.
[02:22:53.881 --> 02:22:54.501]  And I love freedom.
[02:22:54.521 --> 02:22:55.322]  I love the family.
[02:22:55.342 --> 02:22:59.264]  And I see the symbol of the family, a nuclear family, and know what attack it's under.
[02:22:59.284 --> 02:23:02.086]  But you know, llama is a lot cooler than a talking lizard.
[02:23:02.887 --> 02:23:06.489]  And so I got to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that we're very pleased and honored to be here.
[02:23:06.529 --> 02:23:09.992]  And a lot of serious stuff is going on.
[02:23:11.144 --> 02:23:25.749]  But I wanted to just have a little bit of fun here, but also point out how the system manipulates people by normalizing all different forms of tyranny by just having mainstream media say very calmly, oh, it's drag queen story time.
[02:23:26.210 --> 02:23:28.991]  Oh, bring your kids to convicted pedophiles and have them sit in their laps.
[02:23:29.091 --> 02:23:32.632]  Or, oh, drink fluoride, and all the studies say it brain damages you and lowers fertility.
[02:23:32.652 --> 02:23:37.794]  And anybody that raises llamas or horses, they tell you first thing, don't ever give them fluoride water, it'll kill them in a year.
[02:23:39.137 --> 02:23:41.018]  And see, I never talked to these ladies before they came here.
[02:23:41.298 --> 02:23:43.379]  Drew set them up, said nothing to them about fluoride.
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.821]  I say, hey, you give your llamas fluoride?
[02:23:46.861 --> 02:23:48.242]  Hell no, we don't give them fluoride.
[02:23:48.882 --> 02:23:51.724]  That's something that really sinks in for people.
[02:23:52.364 --> 02:23:53.124]  Let's kill them.
[02:23:53.585 --> 02:23:54.245]  Fluorescent lights.
[02:23:54.265 --> 02:23:56.346]  Get some of that magic ambient light in here now.
[02:23:56.826 --> 02:23:58.407]  You just look at the eyes of these llamas.
[02:23:58.447 --> 02:23:59.528]  See, now they're calm.
[02:24:00.028 --> 02:24:00.568]  Now they're happy.
[02:24:00.588 --> 02:24:02.089]  Let's fly around on camera seven here.
[02:24:02.609 --> 02:24:03.950]  And Matt Bracken is about to take over.
[02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:05.031]  This is just an amazing moment.
[02:24:05.372 --> 02:24:07.273]  You know, I don't mind the llama in the background.
[02:24:07.313 --> 02:24:09.915]  That did calm him to see the great master llama.
[02:24:10.176 --> 02:24:16.681]  Not the Dalai Lama, not quite a deity in the flesh, but still, still something akin to it.
[02:24:17.562 --> 02:24:19.043]  But again, ladies and gentlemen...
[02:24:19.850 --> 02:24:22.911]  This is an attempt to get people thinking outside the box.
[02:24:22.971 --> 02:24:24.452]  And Matt Bragg is going to get very, very serious here.
[02:24:24.832 --> 02:24:29.134]  Please don't forget that we're able to fund our reporters and pull stunts like this and run this operation.
[02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:31.275]  Defiance of the Globalist, thanks to you supporting us.
[02:24:31.655 --> 02:24:34.056]  And we have really serious great products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:24:34.376 --> 02:24:35.456]  We have a big, huge mega sale.
[02:24:35.496 --> 02:24:36.617]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[02:24:36.637 --> 02:24:37.557]  It's about to end this weekend.
[02:24:37.897 --> 02:24:39.458]  Double Patriot points on any future order.
[02:24:39.638 --> 02:24:40.618]  50% off all the supplements.
[02:24:41.259 --> 02:24:42.539]  And store-wide free shipping.
[02:24:42.559 --> 02:24:46.101]  And that's on water filters, air filtration, all the great storable foods.
[02:24:46.461 --> 02:24:47.141]  You know, we hope
[02:24:47.301 --> 02:24:58.404]  That we can still be somewhat of a free country into the future and be on air to counter all this, but they're coming after your free speech, they're coming after your sovereignty, and they're really ashamed they want to come after our elected president.
[02:24:59.304 --> 02:25:03.705]  And so, we've just, you know, are the llamas moaning?
[02:25:05.326 --> 02:25:05.646]  Talking?
[02:25:05.666 --> 02:25:09.127]  Hound dogs do that.
[02:25:15.949 --> 02:25:16.709]  Let's get their attention.
[02:25:16.729 --> 02:25:17.430]  Wideshot, please.
[02:25:18.390 --> 02:25:19.210]  Let's go to camera two.
[02:25:28.812 --> 02:25:31.252]  Is that concerning them or is that like gibberish to them?
[02:25:33.593 --> 02:25:34.273]  I'm communicating.
[02:25:34.293 --> 02:25:35.653]  Well, tell me some of the calls for them.
[02:25:36.553 --> 02:25:39.134]  It's not like a pig, like... Well, I kind of... He likes that.
[02:25:39.234 --> 02:25:39.554]  Is it a...
[02:25:45.077 --> 02:25:51.680]  Here's a... I got your attention?
[02:25:51.801 --> 02:25:56.023]  How about this?
[02:25:57.003 --> 02:25:57.323]  A dog?
[02:25:58.204 --> 02:26:02.206]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Matt Bracken is joining us.
[02:26:02.246 --> 02:26:03.307]  Matt, what do you think about this?
[02:26:03.327 --> 02:26:08.809]  You weren't told today, enemiesofforeignanddomestic.com, that you would be in the middle of an invasion of llamas, did you?
[02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.791]  Llama fest.
[02:26:11.511 --> 02:26:13.192]  You're not, you're not llama-phobic, are you?
[02:26:13.996 --> 02:26:14.536]  Not at all.
[02:26:14.717 --> 02:26:20.000]  You know, I'm in Florida, so my water supply is completely different from what's there in the studio.
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:27.685]  I'm not drawing any inferences, but you know, sometimes people forget that they already took a supplement, and then they took two.
[02:26:28.826 --> 02:26:31.968]  And on some, it could even happen, you could take three.
[02:26:32.708 --> 02:26:40.433]  I'm not saying that there's anything going on in the Austin studio, but I'm telling you, whatever is happening, I want to get in on it.
[02:26:43.925 --> 02:26:52.269]  When you make the point about the emus and the llamas and the geckos, Madison Avenue doesn't do any of this by accident.
[02:26:52.810 --> 02:27:01.354]  It's not like some rogue executive gets up and says, let's spend $100 million on an ad campaign for something and just see if it works or not.
[02:27:01.894 --> 02:27:02.955]  They've already tested it.
[02:27:04.055 --> 02:27:09.058]  And like what Mike Adams was saying, the neurological processes are well explored.
[02:27:09.518 --> 02:27:13.040]  These people, the Madison Avenue ad people,
[02:27:14.212 --> 02:27:17.654]  They have psychologists on the staff.
[02:27:17.734 --> 02:27:19.095]  I mean, they're not just winging it.
[02:27:19.295 --> 02:27:19.876]  Here's an example.
[02:27:19.896 --> 02:27:20.836]  They understand us.
[02:27:21.176 --> 02:27:21.817]  You're absolutely right.
[02:27:21.857 --> 02:27:23.298]  Here's an example and I'll get off when you take over.
[02:27:24.557 --> 02:27:25.698]  I don't ever really do any marketing.
[02:27:25.738 --> 02:27:27.959]  I just get good products, promote them, sell them at a good price.
[02:27:28.019 --> 02:27:30.880]  But last Christmas, because they put so much pressure on us, I started doing some marketing.
[02:27:31.521 --> 02:27:32.561]  And I went to Amazon.
[02:27:32.601 --> 02:27:35.423]  I said, they put billions into their market research studies.
[02:27:36.243 --> 02:27:42.326]  I said, we've got a winter wonderland thing where it's a blue sky and blue snow and a cottage and trees.
[02:27:42.746 --> 02:27:45.128]  I said, turn it to light color green like they've got.
[02:27:46.068 --> 02:27:50.871]  Less clicks, bigger purchases, boosted sales on that banner 20-30%.
[02:27:51.511 --> 02:27:57.215]  And so, yeah, we can't come up with all this stuff ourselves, but we can just take what the globalists have got, use it against them.
[02:27:57.235 --> 02:27:58.455]  That's kind of what the Chai-coms do.
[02:27:58.776 --> 02:28:00.717]  But we're not going to do the evil things the globalists do.
[02:28:01.137 --> 02:28:02.398]  I'm just like, hey, you got an emu?
[02:28:02.478 --> 02:28:03.518]  I got a llama, okay?
[02:28:04.859 --> 02:28:08.321]  And you just have to know what the, you know, not just the enemies.
[02:28:08.381 --> 02:28:10.682]  You've got some allies that are sometimes enemies.
[02:28:10.722 --> 02:28:13.204]  You've got some people who will be future enemies.
[02:28:14.532 --> 02:28:18.418]  You have to understand what everybody is using in their armory.
[02:28:18.438 --> 02:28:21.122]  What if we had a baby elephant in here?
[02:28:22.083 --> 02:28:24.126]  And if people don't buy products, we electrocute it.
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:34.663]  When the first Europeans arrived in Japan or China, they'd never seen a cannon.
[02:28:34.863 --> 02:28:37.764]  They invented gunpowder, but they'd never seen a cannon.
[02:28:38.284 --> 02:28:44.126]  And it gave the West a huge advantage for a long time until they figured out cannons, learned how to build artillery.
[02:28:45.545 --> 02:28:55.067]  You always need to know what your adversaries, and I'm not just talking about other nations, but the cultural Marxists that are in academia.
[02:28:55.107 --> 02:29:02.829]  Oh yeah, the video games and phones have made kids now where they don't have any personal skills, so now they're going to have apps that teach kids personal skills from a robot.
[02:29:03.169 --> 02:29:05.690]  So we're losing our humanity, we need to get back to it.
[02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:07.350]  And it starts with llamas running around.
[02:29:08.086 --> 02:29:12.508]  These are much more important weapons than maybe cannons and F-35 jets.
[02:29:12.988 --> 02:29:23.192]  Because who needs to worry about ballistic missiles and jets if you've got your own people programmed to hate themselves?
[02:29:23.592 --> 02:29:24.772]  Exactly, that's what they're doing.
[02:29:24.792 --> 02:29:26.273]  To not want to create a new generation.
[02:29:26.593 --> 02:29:28.353]  Well, you mess with a lion, you get bit.
[02:29:28.393 --> 02:29:29.754]  You mess with a llama, you get spit.
[02:29:32.458 --> 02:29:33.338]  No llamas here.
[02:29:33.718 --> 02:29:34.399]  But they were cute.
[02:29:34.459 --> 02:29:35.559]  I thought it was a green screen.
[02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:40.320]  I was trying to figure out how that was being done until I figured out that there really were llamas there.
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:43.121]  And again, what's the name of the website?
[02:29:45.502 --> 02:29:49.863]  LeslieLaneLlamas.com Leslie Lane.
[02:29:49.883 --> 02:29:52.164]  Sounds like a very nice road.
[02:29:53.564 --> 02:29:54.424]  Leslie Lane.
[02:29:55.485 --> 02:29:56.765]  There, is that you right there with the llama?
[02:30:05.046 --> 02:30:09.508]  Well, and so does your daughter come visiting, too, when the llamas drop by?
[02:30:11.628 --> 02:30:11.988]  She helps.
[02:30:12.008 --> 02:30:12.709]  She's very lovely.
[02:30:13.829 --> 02:30:15.310]  Any men out there who aren't married?
[02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:16.430]  Is your daughter married?
[02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:19.011]  Okay.
[02:30:19.451 --> 02:30:22.792]  Well, you know, that's a tip to humor.
[02:30:22.832 --> 02:30:25.733]  I'm not actually doing that.
[02:30:26.513 --> 02:30:27.474]  Matt Bracken's here.
[02:30:27.634 --> 02:30:29.214]  We gotta say bye-bye, llamas.
[02:30:29.735 --> 02:30:30.815]  Say bye-bye, Matt.
[02:30:32.415 --> 02:30:33.415]  Modern Navy SEAL training.
[02:30:33.435 --> 02:30:34.376]  Say bye-bye, Llama.
[02:30:34.396 --> 02:30:35.736]  It's a code word.
[02:30:35.756 --> 02:30:36.916]  Okay.
[02:30:39.117 --> 02:30:39.597]  Okay.
[02:30:40.598 --> 02:30:51.861]  Bracken's here, and before I get on with my prepared script, I want to say something about the PSYOP that happened in the last half an hour, an hour, last couple segments.
[02:30:52.881 --> 02:31:00.664]  You know, there's something sort of like a Manchurian candidate experiment going on here, and the code word
[02:31:01.624 --> 02:31:03.705]  This is Leslie Lane Farm.
[02:31:04.706 --> 02:31:10.709]  See, we were talking about llamas, but all of this was to inject these three words into our minds.
[02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:16.573]  And I'm not sure when this code will be activated.
[02:31:17.053 --> 02:31:19.114]  But Leslie Lane Farm.
[02:31:19.134 --> 02:31:25.258]  Now, number one, Leslie is the name of the first girl I ever kissed in the sixth grade.
[02:31:25.758 --> 02:31:26.418]  No lie.
[02:31:27.339 --> 02:31:27.819]  Lane.
[02:31:28.159 --> 02:31:29.080]  Leslie Lane.
[02:31:29.793 --> 02:31:30.914]  It's alliterative.
[02:31:31.174 --> 02:31:32.175]  It pulls you in.
[02:31:32.836 --> 02:31:33.377]  Farm.
[02:31:33.917 --> 02:31:35.138]  That gets all the guys.
[02:31:35.479 --> 02:31:42.365]  Here's a woman, sounds like a beautiful woman, Leslie Lane, and she has a farm with llamas.
[02:31:43.486 --> 02:31:44.167]  Can't you see?
[02:31:44.607 --> 02:31:45.968]  You've already been hooked.
[02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:48.571]  The seed has been planted.
[02:31:49.272 --> 02:31:52.715]  And when this is activated, nobody knows what's going to happen.
[02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:57.692]  But put it in the back of your mind, Leslie Lane Farm.
[02:31:57.832 --> 02:31:59.193]  This was no accident.
[02:31:59.253 --> 02:32:00.614]  This was not happenstance.
[02:32:01.334 --> 02:32:02.915]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:03.935 --> 02:32:06.096]  And I'm pretty sure Alex knows what he's doing.
[02:32:07.337 --> 02:32:13.280]  But I'm going to be very on the alert for these future, the future activation of this code.
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:14.321]  Anyway.
[02:32:15.982 --> 02:32:22.585]  Now, what I was going to talk about today, and I am going to talk about, I'm calling the big gaslight.
[02:32:23.143 --> 02:32:30.048]  This is the biggest gaslight in history, and we're seeing the end of an era, really.
[02:32:30.688 --> 02:32:37.272]  To understand this gaslight, you have to go back at least a century to the beginning of modern mass media.
[02:32:38.493 --> 02:32:43.216]  This is when there was the Pulitzer, yellow journalism,
[02:32:45.141 --> 02:32:56.123]  The Cuba War, the Spanish-American War, that was based on the false premise that the Maine had been somehow sabotaged by Cuban frogmen somehow.
[02:32:56.603 --> 02:32:57.963]  It blew up on its own.
[02:32:58.403 --> 02:33:02.024]  Remember, the Maine became the battle cry to get America into a war.
[02:33:02.484 --> 02:33:04.204]  That's more than a century ago.
[02:33:04.764 --> 02:33:07.845]  That's like 130 years ago, 120 years ago.
[02:33:08.685 --> 02:33:13.606]  And the media has basically had us wrapped around their finger ever since then.
[02:33:14.542 --> 02:33:34.325]  In the 1920s and 30s, there were American and other journalists that were basically communist sympathizers, if not out-and-out communists, who went over to the Soviet Union and they acted as complete lackeys for Stalin, for Lenin, for Stalin, for the communists.
[02:33:35.258 --> 02:33:44.520]  A New York Times reporter named Walter Durante, he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 by telling lies about the Soviet Union.
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:45.840]  That things were great.
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:53.502]  That, you know, this hunger going on in parts of the, what they called all of, the Ukraine then was just part of Russia.
[02:33:54.102 --> 02:33:58.483]  So, when they said there was no Russian famine, they were talking about Ukraine.
[02:33:59.153 --> 02:34:02.518]  This is an American New York Times reporter.
[02:34:02.999 --> 02:34:07.425]  He won the Pulitzer Prize for covering for a mass genocide.
[02:34:08.058 --> 02:34:11.041]  Millions of people murdered by Stalin.
[02:34:11.521 --> 02:34:22.450]  The guy, even in this article that you see put up here, if you ever look it up, he talks about how the Bolsheviks have to break a lot of eggs to make their revolution, just like a general in a war.
[02:34:22.810 --> 02:34:27.374]  Sometimes you gotta, you know, push a few thousand people out there where the general knows they'll be killed.
[02:34:27.874 --> 02:34:36.381]  That's Duranty excusing genocide and mass murder for the creation of socialism in Russia at the time.
[02:34:37.230 --> 02:34:40.914]  All the way through the 20th century, it pretty much stayed the same.
[02:34:42.095 --> 02:34:51.924]  When I was a young man, Walter Cronkite was the elder statesman-like anchor of CBS News.
[02:34:52.324 --> 02:35:00.472]  He was by far the most dominant, most trusted, he was called the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite.
[02:35:01.155 --> 02:35:13.023]  It didn't come out until years after he retired that all along he had been a leader of what was called the World Federalist Society, a globalist organization.
[02:35:13.463 --> 02:35:24.311]  Everything he had been doing from World War II through his retirement was to denigrate the concept of national sovereignty and build world government.
[02:35:24.731 --> 02:35:29.514]  That's why in 1968, when the Tet Offensive happened in the beginning in January of 1968,
[02:35:31.303 --> 02:35:33.364]  Walter Cronkite called it a huge defeat.
[02:35:33.405 --> 02:35:34.845]  We can't win in Vietnam.
[02:35:35.146 --> 02:35:38.888]  He was working against America for globalism.
[02:35:39.409 --> 02:35:41.250]  This has continued all the way through.
[02:35:42.030 --> 02:35:48.555]  During the Vietnam War, if you've ever heard the saying, we had to destroy the village to save it.
[02:35:49.075 --> 02:35:51.857]  This was a CNN reporter named Peter Arnett.
[02:35:52.418 --> 02:35:54.379]  Later, he was AP then, CNN later.
[02:35:54.989 --> 02:35:58.470]  Peter Arnett completely made it up, but it was believed.
[02:35:58.690 --> 02:35:59.771]  We're such butchers.
[02:35:59.811 --> 02:36:00.951]  We're such maniacs.
[02:36:01.291 --> 02:36:03.692]  We'll actually destroy a village to save it.
[02:36:04.072 --> 02:36:06.913]  I mean, a trusted newsman said so.
[02:36:07.693 --> 02:36:11.015]  All of his sources were made up, like Mike Adams said last hour.
[02:36:11.615 --> 02:36:19.177]  They'll just invent a source, invent it, and then say, well, it'll be too dangerous to actually explain who it is.
[02:36:19.558 --> 02:36:21.818]  But people went back and looked into Arnett's story.
[02:36:22.198 --> 02:36:23.739]  It was completely invented.
[02:36:25.191 --> 02:36:28.132]  Cronkite talking about pet being a loss.
[02:36:28.532 --> 02:36:31.693]  Arnett, we had to destroy the village to save it.
[02:36:32.133 --> 02:36:41.875]  These were the memes that brainwashed a generation of Americans into thinking, well, you know, the military, they're just out of control maniacs.
[02:36:41.935 --> 02:36:44.336]  It's one My Lai Massacre after another.
[02:36:44.996 --> 02:36:47.376]  This is extremely influential.
[02:36:48.137 --> 02:36:51.657]  This lasted all the way through to George Bush II,
[02:36:54.986 --> 02:36:56.767]  With what was called Memogate.
[02:36:57.248 --> 02:37:01.030]  That's when Dan Rather tried to pull out the same old play.
[02:37:01.430 --> 02:37:11.977]  We're going to invent a memo saying that George Bush was a draft-dodging slacker, and we'll just insert it into the campaign.
[02:37:12.538 --> 02:37:18.542]  But by that time, in the 1990s, it was too late for the mainstream media.
[02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:22.064]  They didn't have a complete seal on the message anymore.
[02:37:22.856 --> 02:37:29.159]  There were independent journalists out there beginning to sneak in and become very important.
[02:37:29.619 --> 02:37:33.501]  I remember this would be like early 2000s, I guess.
[02:37:33.521 --> 02:37:43.687]  This is when the memo gate came out and people on the internet right away realized, wait a minute, how could that memo be legit?
[02:37:44.047 --> 02:37:49.549]  It's made on Microsoft Word with proportional font spacing.
[02:37:50.010 --> 02:37:52.351]  That was impossible on a typewriter.
[02:37:53.445 --> 02:37:55.426]  At the time that the memo was supposed to be written.
[02:37:55.926 --> 02:38:00.189]  That's when the mainstream media started to show cracks in the edifice.
[02:38:00.729 --> 02:38:03.791]  Then, rather, retired were fired in disgrace.
[02:38:04.585 --> 02:38:05.846]  They still try to bring him out.
[02:38:05.886 --> 02:38:08.148]  He's got some, you know, off-brand show.
[02:38:08.688 --> 02:38:10.369]  But he's known as a disgrace.
[02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:13.392]  Only the most hardcore lefties would watch Dan Rather.
[02:38:13.932 --> 02:38:17.054]  So, Dan Rather was the heir to Walter Cronkite.
[02:38:17.615 --> 02:38:24.200]  And truthful, alternative media, new media, took him down and wiped him out.
[02:38:24.935 --> 02:38:30.776]  Now, today, Donald Trump, he is like a nuclear weapon of change.
[02:38:31.336 --> 02:38:34.437]  He has been watching this just like I have, just like you have.
[02:38:34.877 --> 02:38:38.877]  Trump has been observing all of this for, you know, for the last 30, 40 years.
[02:38:39.318 --> 02:38:42.498]  He understands that he is a master of media.
[02:38:43.118 --> 02:38:51.620]  And he has, he has figured out how to actually manipulate and whipsaw the media for his own end.
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:53.000]  And many times,
[02:38:53.726 --> 02:38:57.449]  It looks like he's, in chess terms, it would be like a sacrifice.
[02:38:58.310 --> 02:38:59.791]  It looks like, why would he say that?
[02:38:59.891 --> 02:39:06.357]  Today he said, I'm asking Ukraine and China to help look into the Biden corruption scandal.
[02:39:06.757 --> 02:39:07.738]  Why would he say that?
[02:39:07.818 --> 02:39:09.679]  The media is going crazy today.
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:16.185]  He's actually asking a communist Chinese government to help him in the next election.
[02:39:16.821 --> 02:39:17.843]  They don't understand.
[02:39:18.183 --> 02:39:21.308]  He really is, in this case, playing four-dimensional chess.
[02:39:21.768 --> 02:39:23.691]  And he is many steps ahead of them.
[02:39:24.232 --> 02:39:31.563]  And what he is doing is, he is like the guy with the red laser making the kittens run after the story.
[02:39:32.208 --> 02:39:37.393]  He is playing laser tag with the mainstream media kittens.
[02:39:37.773 --> 02:39:41.116]  He is actually driving them exactly where he wants them.
[02:39:41.496 --> 02:39:43.037]  He understands what he's doing.
[02:39:43.618 --> 02:39:48.082]  And in the next segment, I'm going to explore this further and how
[02:39:48.743 --> 02:39:57.028]  Important this is, that this entire century of mainstream media leftist gaslighting is coming to an end.
[02:39:57.428 --> 02:40:02.532]  And it's going to be Donald Trump that is the change agent that makes this happen.
[02:40:02.912 --> 02:40:04.072]  Be back in a couple minutes.
[02:40:05.974 --> 02:40:16.220]  Okay, before I get back to my story about the mainstream media propaganda organs, a couple of quick things that just jumped out at me as headlines.
[02:40:16.857 --> 02:40:21.020]  The Paris knife attack is notable to me for two reasons.
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.322]  Number one, turns out, oh boy, can you imagine?
[02:40:24.462 --> 02:40:25.943]  He was an Islamic convert.
[02:40:26.504 --> 02:40:27.144]  Go figure.
[02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:32.588]  So what's the common thread with people going running amok with, you know, murdering people?
[02:40:32.608 --> 02:40:36.390]  Islamic convert, okay, there might be something there.
[02:40:38.673 --> 02:40:50.341]  Another thing is that in my third novel, Foreign Enemies and Traitors, the good guys sneak a ceramic knife right into Camp David for a mission, because it's going to get past every kind of a scanner.
[02:40:50.361 --> 02:40:56.286]  Now, if you're looking at a ceramic knife, they actually have to stick some metal in the handle part.
[02:40:57.847 --> 02:40:59.188]  That's about as far as I'll go there.
[02:40:59.948 --> 02:41:01.990]  Anyway, ceramic blades.
[02:41:02.290 --> 02:41:03.751]  Very, very sharp, as you know.
[02:41:04.784 --> 02:41:11.366]  Now, back to the media and how Trump is literally taking them apart block by block.
[02:41:11.946 --> 02:41:16.787]  And they are too stupid, too unaware to even realize it yet.
[02:41:17.587 --> 02:41:23.549]  Today he, right to the reporters, he said, I'm asking China also to look into it.
[02:41:24.249 --> 02:41:27.010]  You can just see the liberals tearing their hair out.
[02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:29.690]  Oh my God, this is like a triple impeachment.
[02:41:30.211 --> 02:41:31.711]  We're going to go after him now.
[02:41:32.987 --> 02:41:37.629]  They do not understand that he is leading them like a dance partner.
[02:41:38.209 --> 02:41:44.131]  Or in a sailboat race, sometimes what happens is what's called a tacking duel.
[02:41:45.011 --> 02:41:53.014]  If one boat is going to turn, the other one may just say, I think I'm better off laying this same heading, but I can't.
[02:41:53.094 --> 02:41:54.394]  I've got to cover that tack.
[02:41:55.370 --> 02:42:04.652]  And what Trump is doing is forcing the media to cover his techs, and he is taking them right to the reef where he's going to run them aground.
[02:42:05.112 --> 02:42:08.252]  This is actually a really brilliant strategy.
[02:42:09.112 --> 02:42:24.715]  And what he is doing is he is exposing to the part of America that is not watching InfoWars, that doesn't watch conservative media or conservative internet websites,
[02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:29.523]  People that have never heard that the Bidens were ever involved in anything.
[02:42:29.603 --> 02:42:35.284]  Because if you're in the liberal narrative bubble, you would have never heard any of this.
[02:42:35.965 --> 02:42:49.648]  So he is throwing out there this Biden corruption, which actually goes back to the first years of Biden being in Congress, where he has used his position to enrich his family.
[02:42:50.168 --> 02:42:52.229]  And this has just been continuous.
[02:42:54.786 --> 02:42:59.848]  What he is doing with the media, it sounds like, oh, he's actually incriminating himself.
[02:43:00.188 --> 02:43:03.709]  He's putting more charges for the impeachment inquiry onto himself.
[02:43:04.089 --> 02:43:05.129]  That's not it at all.
[02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:08.631]  He's forcing them to cover his tax.
[02:43:09.271 --> 02:43:13.852]  And he is leading them like a dance partner, straight to where he wants them.
[02:43:14.472 --> 02:43:22.255]  So instead of just the conservative libertarian corner that already knows about these things, I mean, let's go back
[02:43:22.978 --> 02:43:24.179]  A couple of scandals.
[02:43:24.559 --> 02:43:25.580]  Fast and Furious.
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:27.401]  Benghazi.
[02:43:27.941 --> 02:43:29.081]  We knew all about it.
[02:43:29.622 --> 02:43:29.902]  All right?
[02:43:30.022 --> 02:43:31.923]  We understood the intricacies of it.
[02:43:32.864 --> 02:43:38.927]  But the middle of America, the people that are just casual news absorbers, they never heard a word of it.
[02:43:39.407 --> 02:43:47.412]  What Trump is doing is taking the mainstream media and shoving their face over there, and they're going to chase that story.
[02:43:48.052 --> 02:43:49.573]  And as a result,
[02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:57.265]  Tens of millions of Americans that have no idea about Biden corruption are going to hear about it.
[02:43:57.606 --> 02:44:00.588]  So right now, Biden is a dead man walking.
[02:44:01.149 --> 02:44:01.889]  He doesn't know it.
[02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:04.551]  Sanders is still in the hospital.
[02:44:05.152 --> 02:44:07.894]  I don't think he'll ever, he won't be back up to speed.
[02:44:08.234 --> 02:44:11.237]  He won't, and his voters are going to Warren.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:14.043]  Warren is going to be the nominee.
[02:44:14.163 --> 02:44:22.314]  Unless something happens—Deus Ex Machina—I don't think Hillary has a prayer of just jumping into the race like, I'm your savior.
[02:44:22.334 --> 02:44:25.579]  You know, she's like a—that would make her a three-time loser.
[02:44:26.326 --> 02:44:33.989]  It's going to be Elizabeth Warren versus Donald Trump, and he is going to eat her lunch as a communist.
[02:44:34.329 --> 02:44:45.134]  It's going to be free market, enterprise system, freedom versus socialism, communism, and tyranny, and he is going to eat her lunch.
[02:44:45.734 --> 02:44:46.615]  I'm telling you this.
[02:44:47.135 --> 02:44:49.976]  So why is the entire impeachment thing happening right now?
[02:44:50.536 --> 02:44:54.538]  It's because the deep state is in a total panic
[02:44:55.223 --> 02:45:01.750]  Over Bar and Durham going to Italy and making overtures to Australia.
[02:45:02.370 --> 02:45:06.094]  Remember, Italy has had a populist uprising.
[02:45:06.154 --> 02:45:14.683]  Now, Salvini is out temporarily, but that doesn't mean that the security apparatus within Italy also turned leftward immediately.
[02:45:16.304 --> 02:45:18.907]  Bar and Durham went to Italy
[02:45:19.505 --> 02:45:28.533]  They went to the American Embassy to a quiet room, to a bug-proof room, where they could listen to Joseph Mifsud's testimony.
[02:45:29.213 --> 02:45:34.538]  Joseph Mifsud is the Agent Zero of the Russian collusion hoax.
[02:45:34.938 --> 02:45:46.028]  He's the one who allegedly fed Papadopoulos the rumors about the WikiLeaks, and then Australian Ambassador Downer
[02:45:46.787 --> 02:45:56.965]  Supposedly gleaned that information from Papadopoulos and that's the entire reason for the origin of the Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
[02:45:58.907 --> 02:46:04.889]  By now, having heard this deposition, this was Mifsud's Deadman Switch deposition.
[02:46:05.309 --> 02:46:11.871]  I don't even know if Mifsud is still alive, or if maybe they interviewed him and they managed to keep security over that.
[02:46:12.311 --> 02:46:18.973]  But for sure, they listened to Mifsud's Deadman Switch deposition, where he's
[02:46:20.339 --> 02:46:25.401]  You're basically going to say, if anything bad happens to me, if I disappear, this is what really went down.
[02:46:25.862 --> 02:46:34.086]  Mifsud was a CIA operative controlled by Western intelligence agencies, just like Stephen Halper and Alexander Downer.
[02:46:34.986 --> 02:46:37.087]  John Brennan and his clique
[02:46:37.774 --> 02:46:42.535]  Have been pulling the strings behind this entire thing.
[02:46:43.376 --> 02:46:52.138]  Supposedly, for what it's worth, if you can believe the sources, some of them are kind of shaky, Brennan is going to be deposed by Durham.
[02:46:53.118 --> 02:46:55.379]  And this is very serious.
[02:46:55.479 --> 02:46:56.599]  People can go to jail.
[02:46:56.939 --> 02:47:00.260]  This is the deep state facing total ruin.
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:05.162]  That's why the impeachment, this half-baked impeachment thing is coming out.
[02:47:05.622 --> 02:47:06.302]  It's an attempt
[02:47:06.877 --> 02:47:16.262]  To light a backfire against the giant firestorm which is coming in the form of the Barr-Durham reports.
[02:47:16.983 --> 02:47:18.023]  What is a backfire?
[02:47:18.444 --> 02:47:30.871]  It's an attempt to start a smaller fire in front of an onrushing forest fire to burn up all the fuel, to take away the fuel so that there's nothing for the forest fire to consume.
[02:47:31.411 --> 02:47:35.033]  It's a last-ditch, desperate attempt by the deep state.
[02:47:35.473 --> 02:47:36.294]  It's half-baked.
[02:47:36.953 --> 02:47:37.694]  It's lame.
[02:47:38.094 --> 02:47:49.944]  Trump is so unafraid of it that he doubled down today and said, yeah, I'm asking Ukraine and China, causing the media to take that bait, throwing more attention on it.
[02:47:50.645 --> 02:48:03.136]  And when the Barr and Durham reports come down, and that's the only reason those two went to Italy together, sitting together, to listen to the Joseph Mifsud deposition,
[02:48:04.173 --> 02:48:11.481]  If Joseph Mifsud is saying, look, I got my orders through the CIA chain of command like I have for the last 25 years.
[02:48:12.262 --> 02:48:14.724]  This came from, you know, from Langley.
[02:48:15.365 --> 02:48:16.786]  John Brennan was the boss.
[02:48:17.587 --> 02:48:21.031]  I took this as another operation just like dozens before.
[02:48:21.889 --> 02:48:35.191]  Same thing with Stephen Halper, who's made, you know, something like one and a half, two million dollars in black defense department budget invoices to give, like, lectures.
[02:48:35.251 --> 02:48:36.051]  I mean, come on!
[02:48:36.231 --> 02:48:41.272]  Stephen Halper and Joseph Mifsud are CIA operatives.
[02:48:41.872 --> 02:48:44.813]  They just, they do what they're told, they follow orders.
[02:48:45.353 --> 02:48:50.554]  If those guys have come out and said, this was all a deep state operation,
[02:48:51.334 --> 02:48:57.375]  Comey, Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, a lot of these guys are going to go to prison.
[02:48:57.996 --> 02:49:01.696]  And that's why the Democrats are in such a hysteria today.
[02:49:02.537 --> 02:49:04.717]  That's exactly why this is all going on.
[02:49:05.257 --> 02:49:10.678]  And I think that Trump, you know, unlike us, Trump has ultimate security clearances.
[02:49:11.278 --> 02:49:14.679]  He knows what a lot of the down cards on this poker table are.
[02:49:15.239 --> 02:49:17.900]  He already knows what a lot of those down cards are.
[02:49:18.613 --> 02:49:19.734]  And he's confident.
[02:49:20.015 --> 02:49:22.017]  That's why he was doing what he was doing today.
[02:49:22.037 --> 02:49:28.063]  You know, Schiff and the rest of these stooges, they are going to be blown out of the water.
[02:49:28.984 --> 02:49:34.969]  And this entire impeachment thing is going to be Democrats running for cover from it.
[02:49:35.410 --> 02:49:41.336]  You know, when it turns out, like Mike Adams said last hour, the whistleblower may even just be a figment.
[02:49:41.946 --> 02:49:46.750]  You know, this anonymous whistleblower, he may not even exist.
[02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:56.158]  He might be another creation, like Peter Arnett's mysterious colonel that said, oh, we had to destroy the village to save it.
[02:49:56.598 --> 02:50:01.902]  This is the left-wing playbook that has worked for decades.
[02:50:02.523 --> 02:50:07.447]  And that paradigm that they've been running on, they've been confident it could never stop, it could never fail.
[02:50:09.248 --> 02:50:17.351]  It is blowing up in their faces, and Donald Trump is the media master and change agent that is doing it all.
[02:50:18.311 --> 02:50:22.613]  Well, we'll see if that happens, and I'll see you next Thursday, maybe.
[02:50:35.663 --> 02:50:46.953]  In the next two minutes, I am asking you very respectfully for your attention, because these two products go together like a horse and carriage, and they can change your life in so many ways.
[02:50:47.513 --> 02:50:53.539]  And they also fund the Infowar, which certainly changes all our lives for the better, because if we weren't here fighting back,
[02:50:54.994 --> 02:50:57.115]  The globalists probably would have already had things sewn up.
[02:50:57.135 --> 02:51:07.260]  I mean, they legitimately think that InfoWars has been instrumental in spreading rebellion against their globalist operation and the explosion of populism and nationalism because it's true.
[02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:09.901]  Our guests, our listeners, we the people,
[02:51:10.501 --> 02:51:18.272]  Have absolutely challenged their corrupt narrative on man-made global warming, on their attacks on the family, their attacks on the Second Amendment.
[02:51:18.752 --> 02:51:21.696]  It is an incredibly beautiful time to be alive right now.
[02:51:22.097 --> 02:51:24.039]  And that's because you've been taking action.
[02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:26.202]  But we need funding and you need these products.
[02:51:27.219 --> 02:51:33.124]  Now our Ultimate Bone Broth is the strongest, best formula out there at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:51:33.944 --> 02:51:43.732]  It has great high quality bone broth concentrate from chicken, it has the chaga mushroom, it has bee pollen, turmeric and so much more.
[02:51:44.152 --> 02:51:44.833]  So strength,
[02:51:45.473 --> 02:51:49.734]  Stamina, your bones, your muscles, your tendons, it really is the essence.
[02:51:50.054 --> 02:51:57.136]  As all the ancients, every culture knew, they would boil down bones for health and for life and for comfort and just for focus.
[02:51:57.656 --> 02:51:58.256]  It's incredible.
[02:51:58.917 --> 02:52:03.198]  Now we also have Gut Fusion, which is an amazing product I never promote.
[02:52:03.518 --> 02:52:11.260]  We set out to look at top selling brands of high quality fiber that helps flush your guts out, but also other key ingredients that are known for
[02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:13.682]  The gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[02:52:13.702 --> 02:52:14.683]  He says, I have an AR-15.
[02:52:37.659 --> 02:52:41.220]  And I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:42.801]  People want to do the right thing.
[02:52:42.921 --> 02:52:46.502]  Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike.
[02:52:46.782 --> 02:52:49.703]  I think we're naive to think that we can just maintain the status quo.
[02:52:50.503 --> 02:52:52.424]  Beto knows what he's doing.
[02:52:54.024 --> 02:52:57.425]  He's sitting there telling you that, oh, a man just walked up to me.
[02:52:57.585 --> 02:52:58.346]  It's a total lie.
[02:52:58.986 --> 02:53:03.567]  And said, oh, I'm going to turn in my AR-15 so people don't get hurt.
[02:53:04.567 --> 02:53:05.968]  That's selling the idea.
[02:53:07.062 --> 02:53:12.108]  That if you own a gun, you're responsible for what criminals do with a gun.
[02:53:12.908 --> 02:53:15.131]  That is such a fraud.
[02:53:15.191 --> 02:53:16.953]  It's so anti-American.
[02:53:17.694 --> 02:53:20.357]  Now you can always tell when Beto's lying, his lips are moving.
[02:53:21.676 --> 02:53:23.017]  Or his brain's thinking.
[02:53:23.698 --> 02:53:24.719]  The man's a total fraud.
[02:53:25.379 --> 02:53:31.324]  His father-in-law's worth $28 billion, a big anti-American globalist, gave a billion dollars to Beto's wife.
[02:53:31.925 --> 02:53:37.349]  The guy wrote papers fantasizing about killing children, running them over with cars.
[02:53:37.890 --> 02:53:39.451]  He got arrested for a hit-and-run.
[02:53:40.012 --> 02:53:41.553]  He got arrested for burglary.
[02:53:41.933 --> 02:53:43.975]  The man isn't allowed to own a gun.
[02:53:44.235 --> 02:53:45.716]  He is a deranged criminal.
[02:53:46.636 --> 02:53:48.777]  But of course, deranged criminals want your guns.
[02:53:49.157 --> 02:53:58.101]  They're now turning their guns and are facing five years in jail in New Zealand, even though the man that shot those people wasn't from New Zealand and got the guns illegally.
[02:53:58.321 --> 02:54:03.944]  The globalists want to have a revolution against America, and they want us disarmed before they do it.
[02:54:04.284 --> 02:54:08.526]  1776 could commence again at any time, because they're losing their information war.
[02:54:09.366 --> 02:54:10.686]  Against us, because we're telling the truth.
[02:54:11.366 --> 02:54:16.187]  And so now, Beto is making his move with others, and he has to be rebuked.
[02:54:16.687 --> 02:54:17.648]  He has to be exposed.
[02:54:17.748 --> 02:54:24.289]  And the way to do it is not be intimidated about your Second Amendment, and let them know that you're fully aware of what they're trying to do.
[02:54:24.769 --> 02:54:29.190]  Beto's campaign says, if you want to prove you're not a bad person, turn your guns in.
[02:54:29.390 --> 02:54:31.030]  Hey, Beto, you turn your guns in.
[02:54:31.650 --> 02:54:35.211]  It's a campaign slogan where he says, turn them in, to show you're good.
[02:54:35.411 --> 02:54:36.911]  Lay down your arms, you damn
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:38.080]  Hands up!
[02:54:38.261 --> 02:54:38.621]  Come out!
[02:54:39.181 --> 02:54:41.343]  And we'll take you away to the gulag.
[02:54:42.044 --> 02:54:44.406]  They're literally trying to disarm us.
[02:54:45.166 --> 02:54:48.149]  They openly say they want to put conservatives in forced labor camps.
[02:54:48.169 --> 02:54:49.270]  They openly say they want to kill us.
[02:54:49.830 --> 02:54:53.954]  They openly say they want to destroy us because we support Trump or America.
[02:54:54.889 --> 02:54:56.390]  You've got to stand up and say no.
[02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:58.592]  And you've got to fund those that are fighting.
[02:54:58.892 --> 02:55:01.234]  Because we're pro-Second Amendment, we're under massive attack.
[02:55:01.695 --> 02:55:03.056]  Hack attack, lawsuits, you name it.
[02:55:03.456 --> 02:55:11.824]  But you can help us stand against this and spread the word on the street against these bullies with a great shirt like Beto Nye, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:55:12.224 --> 02:55:16.668]  Whether it's supplements or a Betsy Ross flag or a water filter or a book or a film,
[02:55:17.168 --> 02:55:22.690]  These are products that are great, that you need, and shopping with us helps us continue to fight for all of our basic freedoms.
[02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:24.791]  Infowarestore.com.
[02:55:25.051 --> 02:55:25.891]  Thank you for your support.
[02:55:26.171 --> 02:55:26.632]  Hell yes!
[02:55:26.752 --> 02:55:31.653]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47... And it is very hard to think about this.
[02:55:32.854 --> 02:55:37.576]  Um... Bill Gates and his father, who ran Planned Parenthood, are right.
[02:55:39.176 --> 02:55:43.878]  We need to dumb down, sterilize, and abort as many people as we can.
[02:55:45.060 --> 02:55:52.810]  We need to put as much fluoride in the water of those that are born to dumb them down as much as possible so they're more easily managed.
[02:55:53.411 --> 02:55:57.216]  You see, I've decided to try to join Bill Gates and try to start thinking like him.
[02:55:58.004 --> 02:56:02.747]  Worldwide, he directed genetically engineered mosquitoes to bite us and give us diseases.
[02:56:03.247 --> 02:56:05.329]  But he said it was in the name of helping people.
[02:56:05.909 --> 02:56:13.894]  Just like he funded the projects of these, quote, sterilized male mosquitoes that would go out in Brazil and cause the other mosquito populations to implode.
[02:56:13.914 --> 02:56:17.337]  But now, they mutated and the numbers exploded!
[02:56:17.797 --> 02:56:20.939]  And suddenly, the mosquitoes are making people much sicker.
[02:56:21.779 --> 02:56:21.920]  Oh!
[02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:23.721]  It wasn't a mistake!
[02:56:23.781 --> 02:56:24.181]  None of it was!
[02:56:24.221 --> 02:56:25.122]  Now, I'm hilarious.
[02:56:25.822 --> 02:56:27.482]  Of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[02:56:27.962 --> 02:56:28.863]  I brought some here.
[02:56:29.323 --> 02:56:35.824]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[02:56:35.924 --> 02:56:38.685]  Let me tell you, except 5G, 4G, 3G, it's killing us all.
[02:56:38.725 --> 02:56:39.225]  We deserve to die.
[02:56:39.905 --> 02:56:42.165]  And don't go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:42.405 --> 02:56:42.845]  Oh, no.
[02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:47.386]  Don't get high-quality fish oil or turmeric that fights inflammation.
[02:56:47.626 --> 02:56:49.647]  Don't get any of the great antioxidants we have.
[02:56:49.947 --> 02:56:53.508]  Don't get ultimate bone broth that's selling out at 50% off.
[02:56:53.548 --> 02:56:54.428]  It's the last week to get it.
[02:56:55.168 --> 02:57:00.850]  I don't support organizations and institutions that are independent and fighting for a pro-human future.
[02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:06.491]  Roll over to Bella Melinda Gates, the rightful rulers of this earth.
[02:57:07.311 --> 02:57:10.852]  Do not go to Infowarsstore.com and support me.
[02:57:11.893 --> 02:57:13.873]  And do not spread the articles and videos.
[02:57:14.333 --> 02:57:15.714]  Just give up and submit.
[02:57:16.034 --> 02:57:17.774]  Give your children over to Billy Boy.
[02:57:18.435 --> 02:57:19.435]  Truth is Satan's good.
[02:57:22.782 --> 02:57:25.708]  Alright, thanks for watching, and thank you Bill Gates for all you do.
[02:57:25.748 --> 02:57:26.850]  Thanks for those mosquitoes.
[02:57:27.211 --> 02:57:28.153]  Thanks for 5G.
[02:57:28.474 --> 02:57:29.396]  Thanks for the Kim Trails.
