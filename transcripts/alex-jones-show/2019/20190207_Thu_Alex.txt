[00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.150]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.720]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.719]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, February 7th, 2019.
[00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.440]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:52.826]  We're going to be here for the next four hours as we are every weekday, 11 a.m.
[00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:53.906]  3 p.m.
[00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:54.867]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.932]  There is obviously a ton of news and information to cover.
[00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:21.047]  And we're still looking at the aftermath of the very powerful State of the Union by the President and some polls having him as high as 82% CBS poll, 76% even CNN's fake polls where they normally skew 20-30 points against Republicans had him up there in the low 50s.
[00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:23.355]  Very exciting.
[00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:32.660]  Showing when the president can punch through and reach the people, the people resonate with the good, wholesome, common sense message.
[00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:49.327]  That said, Trump's support of the new NAFTA-GATT negotiation, that does make some better deals for America on trade, is a total nightmare, written by Silicon Valley within it,
[00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:55.837]  That emboldens the massive monopoly tactics and censorship we've seen.
[00:01:56.017 --> 00:02:05.081]  And I think this is such a fundamental area that I don't know what to do.
[00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:08.122]  And I want to open the phones up and get your take on this.
[00:02:08.382 --> 00:02:09.802]  And I normally am very decisive.
[00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:10.383]  Folks know that.
[00:02:10.403 --> 00:02:11.903]  Sometimes too decisive.
[00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:15.625]  But everything else Trump's doing is good.
[00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:26.867]  He's way better than the Democrats, but if he won't defend the First Amendment, and he lets these monopolies operate that censor him and everybody else, what are you supposed to do?
[00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:33.251]  I mean, you have to drop your support for the President and let him know that, so you get him back on the straight and narrow.
[00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:41.976]  And I don't like pulling stunts like that, like Ian Coulter does, but you know, maybe Ian Coulter's right and I've been wrong, and I've been too easy on the President.
[00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:45.752]  On a lot of issues, like amnesty.
[00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:51.295]  And sure, we're like, well, the Democrats are going to refuse anything Trump offers, so he just makes them look like fools.
[00:02:51.835 --> 00:02:54.096]  And he goes up the approval rating with Hispanics, being reasonable.
[00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:57.278]  Yeah, I know that.
[00:02:58.218 --> 00:03:05.842]  But at the same time, this country is being collapsed from within and without.
[00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:07.323]  It's just crazy.
[00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:09.764]  And then there's the whole censorship front.
[00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:13.086]  The whole censorship front is just unbelievable.
[00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:40.061]  I scan through a ton of news like everybody does who's a listener to the show that we're all news junkies, and I see in the background every day 50, 60, 70 articles that I don't have time to read, but I scan, where major GOP strategists banned on Twitter for criticizing Senator Warren lying on her entrance form to the Texas bar.
[00:03:42.216 --> 00:03:45.518]  And then you read, oh, they apologized and reinstated her account.
[00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.343]  And that way you just hear this chatter of censorship, and then another person, and another person, and another person.
[00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:58.308]  And in the background there's the thousands of people getting banned off all these platforms that you don't even hear about anymore.
[00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.714]  So it just becomes this background chatter, like a symphony warming up.
[00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.691]  Ahead of the real finale.
[00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:13.916]  It's total and complete, Chinese style, global social score system that is their plan.
[00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:19.241]  And that's why people got so mad at Joe Rogan with Jack Dorsey on from Twitter.
[00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:21.062]  It was just all complete lies.
[00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.284]  Oh, we don't censor anybody.
[00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:28.068]  And Joe at the end was like, thank you for being such a moral CEO and standing up First Amendment.
[00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:31.491]  It was like, it's like saying to Hitler, thank you for supporting Jews.
[00:04:33.263 --> 00:04:33.663]  Thank you.
[00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.606]  It's just upside-down world while all this is happening.
[00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:42.249]  The Internet's going from free and open in the West to being selected and force-fed and controlled.
[00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.193]  And you've got all these people on their hands and knees groveling to the big tech gods so they can be cool.
[00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:54.257]  It's like the old Soviet Union where, you know, you had one commission that controlled all the plays and all the TV shows, and it sucked.
[00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:56.419]  And it's like, oh, but they're big stars.
[00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.301]  Yeah, because you toe the line and you're force-fed.
[00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:01.082]  You're just absolutely shameful.
[00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:09.306]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day.

[00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.002]  InfoWars.
[00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:21.943]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:28.688]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:49.895]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:57.262 --> 00:07:03.427]  America and the world and what's left of Christendom is being gaslighted.
[00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:08.332]  The news is meant to be upside down world.
[00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:11.263]  News alert!
[00:07:11.403 --> 00:07:15.945]  Church of Satan warns of Mike Pence and the dangers of Christians to our children.
[00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:17.705]  News alert!
[00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:23.967]  Extremists don't like humans and animals being spliced together and the first gene-edited babies being born.
[00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:26.348]  News flash!
[00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:31.449]  Republicans are being banned from criticizing Democrats or saying learn to code.
[00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.431]  News flash!
[00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:39.552]  Democrats angry at Trump for saying we shouldn't have post-birth abortion.
[00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:47.821]  You know, later in the broadcast, we're going to show video of post-birth abortions.
[00:07:48.942 --> 00:07:53.485]  There will be viewer discretion advised, but PBS has shown this.
[00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:54.726]  Let's not show it yet.
[00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:57.328]  Give people time to tune out.
[00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.053]  We're going to show footage of post-birth abortions.
[00:08:04.807 --> 00:08:07.009]  These babies deserve to be humanized.
[00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:11.632]  Sure, I know you're not going to want to watch an animal butchered or a child butchered.
[00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:15.475]  But we have to humanize them.
[00:08:15.956 --> 00:08:17.137]  And see, that's the next step.
[00:08:17.197 --> 00:08:18.498]  They're harvesting the organs.
[00:08:19.158 --> 00:08:20.399]  And that's why they want us off air.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.842]  We go to the next step of what this is really all about.
[00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:28.445]  We bring them down before they've conditioned us to accept the next step.
[00:08:29.386 --> 00:08:31.848]  These are monsters using psychological warfare.
[00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:32.709]  I'm going to explain it again.
[00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:40.033]  The governor of Virginia is a pediatric surgeon specializing in organ removal.
[00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:53.485]  That's why he wants to explain to you we're going to keep them alive after they're born, keep them comfortable, because he has to normalize that at the hospital and normalize it to everyone else.
[00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:57.648]  This is a normalization process by a snake creature.
[00:09:01.131 --> 00:09:01.572]  You understand?
[00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:11.563]  They need to keep the children alive for a few days to a week while they get the donors lined up to get maximum cash.
[00:09:12.764 --> 00:09:18.647]  It's like keeping the aeration going on minnows at the bait shop.
[00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:21.808]  That goes off a few hours, the minnows are dead.
[00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:25.290]  And you can't put them on a hook and catch bass with them.
[00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.931]  Now let's go up from minnows
[00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.850]  We all feel sorry for it.
[00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.491]  The left says you shouldn't even have bait fish.
[00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:32.072]  It's abusive.
[00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:35.333]  Seriously, PETA says eating fish is bad.
[00:09:37.454 --> 00:09:40.095]  We've humanized the one-inch minnow.
[00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:42.096]  If you don't have aeration, it dies.
[00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:46.478]  They have to keep the babies alive to get the organs.
[00:09:48.218 --> 00:09:50.739]  And when they're done, they suck every drop of blood out.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.660]  They render down all the skin for collagen.
[00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:55.101]  All the organs are sold.
[00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:57.442]  And I'm sorry to be so macabre here, but
[00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:09.154]  If we don't admit what's going on, it's like Germans at the end of World War II didn't believe there were any death camps or that Hitler was killing anybody.
[00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.075]  And Hitler was.
[00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:11.636]  He wrote the Final Solution.
[00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:12.897]  Those documents came out.
[00:10:13.138 --> 00:10:15.980]  He was killing millions of people all over Europe, in Russia.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.181]  It's a fact.
[00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:29.450]  And Eisenhower couldn't believe the fact that Germans would get in his face town leaders during the occupation of Germany and would say, we didn't do that.
[00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:32.874]  So he said, you're going to a death camp and you're going to help clean up dead bodies.
[00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:40.103]  And see, that's what I'm doing here.
[00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:44.681]  Is Joe Rogan said Alex Jones is obviously mentally ill.
[00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:45.781]  He's gone to a bad place.
[00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:54.307]  Let's play the clip and then he played the literal Soros funded media group clip from a Soros funded group and for media matters.
[00:10:54.807 --> 00:10:58.050]  So exact Soros funding exact talking points going.
[00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.310]  I don't get talking points.
[00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:01.952]  Hiding in plain view.
[00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:05.034]  He's either got an IQ about 70 or he's a lying snake.
[00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:06.455]  It's the latter.
[00:11:08.116 --> 00:11:09.457]  And he goes, yeah, listen to this.
[00:11:09.497 --> 00:11:10.078]  He claims that
[00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:15.741]  And of course the tape's edited by the Soros group.
[00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:23.511]  And he cites the so-called news group and plays it where I say that they would go have sex with dead bodies at the morgue.
[00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.952]  And that they found them with dead kids in dungeons and that they would drink their blood and eat the pituitary gland.
[00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:40.597]  And in 30 seconds, the crew typed in Jimmy Savelle, 500 raped children, murdered children, eaten children, sex with dead bodies, eating their brains.
[00:11:40.978 --> 00:11:43.599]  Just type in Jimmy Savelle, sex with dead kids.
[00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:44.719]  Just type it in!
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.142]  Major BBC presenter who supplied the kids to everybody.
[00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:59.877]  How BBC star Jimmy Savile allegedly, and it's been confirmed in the British News, got away with abusing 500 children and sex with dead bodies.
[00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:10.969]  Now Joe, if you go read the London Telegraph, or you go read the police reports, and I've had members of Parliament on talking about it, they would eat children.
[00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:13.872]  And you're like, I can't believe that exists.
[00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:17.776]  Well, we all know about psychopaths.
[00:12:17.856 --> 00:12:22.159]  They're evil people that like to mount people's heads on walls, torture people.
[00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.560]  You know, that's not just in American Psycho.
[00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:32.786]  So, yes, Joe, we're in a bad place when they're splicing humans with animals for 30, 40 years and now it's just breaking.
[00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:36.488]  We're in a bad place when the iPhones can watch and listen to us in real time.
[00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:44.333]  We're in a bad place when I'm up here covering all this and you just say, hey,
[00:12:45.592 --> 00:12:46.132]  Pizza Gate.
[00:12:46.372 --> 00:12:47.493]  Pedophilia doesn't exist.
[00:12:49.374 --> 00:12:53.976]  You know, I've gotten a lot more sophisticated in the last two years since I've been through the system.
[00:12:54.216 --> 00:13:04.122]  I saw the media focus off of the WikiLeaks documents that was true Satanism, Aleister Crowley rituals, kids will be in the hot tub for your pleasure, you know, all of it.
[00:13:05.082 --> 00:13:06.583]  John Podesta, Tony Podesta stuff.
[00:13:08.134 --> 00:13:18.082]  To the media going, Reddit is on fire, and 4chan, it was the LA Times, New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, they were all, look, it's all there.
[00:13:20.084 --> 00:13:22.466]  The Internet's claiming they're killing people in a pizza place.
[00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:27.490]  So we go look at it, it's where a bunch of Democrats hang out, but there's no evidence of that.
[00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:32.294]  Then they go, well, Jones, you need to admit that that part was wrong.
[00:13:32.615 --> 00:13:36.118]  And I said, well, I did cover what everybody else was covering and said people are looking into it.
[00:13:37.122 --> 00:13:41.366]  And I said, OK, I got that part wrong, just like any investigator would get something wrong, something right.
[00:13:41.546 --> 00:13:46.530]  They go, oh my gosh, Jones admits to purposely creating a hoax that pedophilia exists.
[00:13:46.851 --> 00:13:48.732]  Well, I mean, my God, turn on children's television.
[00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.454]  That's all it is, is sexualization of children.
[00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:55.779]  Ten times the number of child traffickers have now been busted just the last two years.
[00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:58.161]  And Trump talks about it in his State of the Union.
[00:14:00.563 --> 00:14:11.410]  And says we've busted massive amounts of sex traffickers and child traffickers and Cortez won't stand up and won't clap and Kamilah Harris shakes her head and looks pissed.
[00:14:14.112 --> 00:14:28.341]  I mean every day there's new articles about sex cults with little kids and shelling their bodies and weird Islamic cults with dead kids buried in subterranean caverns and nobody gets in trouble and just this is a full-out assault and
[00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:38.094]  We know that pedophilia is out of control and you've got all these drag kid stuff going on.
[00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:52.618]  Where you have little kids at gay bars talking about using ketamine, talking about group sex, talking about all this insane crap with full-grown men.
[00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:57.860]  In one case, who's a convicted famous axe murderer.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.604]  Little kids dressed up like women, with men, never with their family.
[00:15:03.924 --> 00:15:04.925]  The parents don't work.
[00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:06.866]  They're starting at five.
[00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:09.649]  Their son, he's 11 now, started performing.
[00:15:12.571 --> 00:15:13.091]  What's his name?
[00:15:13.171 --> 00:15:13.991]  Desmond is Amazing?
[00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:15.592]  The Amazing Desmond?
[00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:20.093]  And then he's always just with, oh, where's Junior at?
[00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:26.936]  Oh, he's off with an axe murderer who's a famous guy that was into getting underage people onto drugs and group sex.
[00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:33.658]  He started a whole movement where men act like babies and then other men have sex with them and simulated pedophilia.
[00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:38.159]  I mean, that's actually what he started, this whole club boy thing.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.601]  And then, oh, it's like right there, oh, but Joe Rogan, there's nothing going on.
[00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.462]  Alex Jones is in a bad place.
[00:15:46.062 --> 00:15:50.824]  Jimmy Savelle is in hospitals drinking kids' blood, okay?
[00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:53.025]  That's in the nooch, but I'm the bad guy.
[00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:54.526]  I get it, I get it, Joe.
[00:15:54.546 --> 00:16:00.348]  You're out there in L.A., you're out there in that filth pit, and I'm just, I hope you're proud of who you joined, who you're with there, buddy.

[00:17:06.008 --> 00:17:17.412]  I've been on air 24 years, and I set out to awaken America and the world because I believed that humanity weren't cowards.
[00:17:18.393 --> 00:17:19.574]  And the humanity wasn't stupid.
[00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:34.849]  That if folks were shown the facts of what was being constructed by the globalists, by the technocrats, and that their endgame is a anti-God, anti-human, satanic world system, I believed that good men and women would stand up and rally against it.
[00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.632]  And I don't take all the credit for what's happened with Infowars.
[00:17:37.692 --> 00:17:39.354]  In fact, I take very little of the credit.
[00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:54.660]  I believe there was a focal point laying it out with the evidence, as only the internet coming into its own 24 years ago could allow, up until that point in history, that people would respond and that the population would start researching themselves and that it would trigger a chain reaction.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.881]  I never intended, though,
[00:17:56.721 --> 00:17:59.823]  To be a hyper-dominant leader at the forefront of this.
[00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:06.187]  I was always about having other guests and other individuals and groups on who were experts in their field to help inform the public even better than I could.
[00:18:06.227 --> 00:18:14.692]  But in the last 10 years, Infowars became the dominant leader, globally, in rebooting nationalism and renaissance against the globalist, post-industrial, neo-feudalist system.
[00:18:14.952 --> 00:18:26.401]  The globalists ignored that, which was fine with me, until about three years ago when they decided to use me against Trump and other nationalists by misrepresenting who I was and what I really said and taking me out of context.
[00:18:26.421 --> 00:18:32.386]  That miscalculation actually spread anti-New World Order information technology around the world faster.
[00:18:32.606 --> 00:18:34.968]  And was critical in putting Trump over the top.
[00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:53.283]  And then they made the decision, because of all the chain reactions everywhere, where there were fan videos every day with 5, 10 million views apiece, and hundreds of millions of views a week on different platforms, not even of my own show, but of derivatives of what I was saying and doing, they hit the panic button and said, we were already looking at total censorship in the next few years.
[00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:58.487]  But let's accelerate the plan, start with him, and then drop the hammer on everybody else.
[00:18:59.608 --> 00:19:00.009]  And it's here.
[00:19:01.144 --> 00:19:01.984]  Total surveillance.
[00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:04.346]  They're listening, they're watching on your phone, on your TV.
[00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:05.907]  It's going into AI computers.
[00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.708]  The technocracy's on an incredible power trip.
[00:19:09.088 --> 00:19:18.873]  Horrible leftists trained in the universities to hate you and your family have been brought into these cults of big tech who are allowed to have access to everything you do.
[00:19:18.893 --> 00:19:20.034]  It's in the news today.
[00:19:20.054 --> 00:19:21.595]  That you have a brain tumor.
[00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:22.335]  That you're pregnant.
[00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:23.376]  That you're depressed.
[00:19:23.956 --> 00:19:24.956]  That you have HIV.
[00:19:25.757 --> 00:19:26.417]  That you're gay.
[00:19:26.717 --> 00:19:27.458]  Whatever it is.
[00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:31.861]  They're there raping your privacy while calling themselves liberal.
[00:19:32.061 --> 00:19:32.542]  They're a fraud.
[00:19:32.642 --> 00:19:49.114]  But the things they've done to this, the things they've pulled against InfoWars, if our audience doesn't realize how critical it is, and don't keep spreading the word, and don't keep sharing articles and videos, and don't keep buying the great products you already need anyways, The Globalist will be successful in the next year or so shutting down InfoWars.
[00:19:49.174 --> 00:19:50.855]  So, I'm shooting up the bat signal here.
[00:19:51.196 --> 00:19:56.360]  You've really supported us over the years, but the fight's now reaching the critical part of the battle, and I need your commitment
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.286]  To get great products you already need, but to steadfastly get them at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:20:07.135 --> 00:20:09.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.777 --> 00:20:32.458]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:32.918 --> 00:20:34.479]  Because there is a war on.
[00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:39.062]  Or your mind.
[00:20:39.082 --> 00:20:45.446]  So, Bill Maher does go on TV and say that 35-year-olds should be able to have sex with 12-year-olds and that it's love.
[00:20:45.886 --> 00:20:47.607]  That's a quote.
[00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:52.870]  He names his program, production company, Kid Love.
[00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:56.052]  That's the slogan of NAMBLA.
[00:20:58.113 --> 00:20:58.774]  We love children.
[00:20:58.834 --> 00:20:59.234]  Kid Love.
[00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:07.841]  That's the code words they use on facilities where they want to let fellow pedos know what's going on.
[00:21:09.622 --> 00:21:18.864]  And then, of course, you have all the other pedophilic jokes of him attacking the Kentucky Catholic students and talking about people having sex with them.
[00:21:19.965 --> 00:21:20.665]  Catholic priest.
[00:21:22.506 --> 00:21:27.047]  Oh, but Joe Rogan, how dare Alex Jones say such horrible things about
[00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:31.191]  Bill Maher.
[00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:33.072]  Bill Maher said these things.
[00:21:33.132 --> 00:21:44.678]  You can't swing a stick in Hollywood and not find a director who isn't a pedophile who then still gets to direct movies with kids.
[00:21:44.898 --> 00:21:46.959]  There's hundreds and hundreds of famous cases.
[00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:48.099]  It's rampant!
[00:21:51.841 --> 00:21:57.824]  Absolutely, totally, completely out of control and rampant.
[00:22:00.666 --> 00:22:03.788]  And then Alex is mentally ill.
[00:22:03.848 --> 00:22:07.011]  He says that there's people having sex with dead kids in hospitals.
[00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:09.773]  And he says they're drinking their blood.
[00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:13.796]  Yeah, you're right, Joe.
[00:22:13.836 --> 00:22:15.197]  I'm in a bad place, man, because I care.
[00:22:17.739 --> 00:22:19.741]  I can't just sit here and rationalize all this stuff.
[00:22:19.761 --> 00:22:26.246]  I mean, take George Soros, the big list man test, the guy you quote from.
[00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.631]  You quote from his Media Matters as your talking point and say it's not a talking point.
[00:22:31.091 --> 00:22:32.952]  It's like Jack Dorsey said, we don't censor anybody.
[00:22:33.212 --> 00:22:34.412]  Everybody has a right to be on Twitter.
[00:22:35.352 --> 00:22:36.212]  Except Alex Jones.
[00:22:36.312 --> 00:22:36.933]  Well, why'd you do it?
[00:22:36.973 --> 00:22:37.633]  Well, I don't know.
[00:22:39.093 --> 00:22:39.533]  You know why?
[00:22:39.553 --> 00:22:48.736]  Because the establishment came down and they said get him off the air because he's a nationalist who with his audience has relaunched nationalist capitalist movements worldwide.
[00:22:49.316 --> 00:22:52.377]  Europe, the EU takeover is falling apart.
[00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:53.377]  They're in panic mode.
[00:22:53.997 --> 00:22:55.138]  All over the world it's happening.
[00:22:55.298 --> 00:22:56.298]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.761]  We have all accomplished a great deal, audience, and I salute you.
[00:23:04.843 --> 00:23:05.123]  Joe!
[00:23:06.964 --> 00:23:08.524]  You know George Soros.
[00:23:09.965 --> 00:23:12.186]  Because I called you and I told you about it, we sort of defended him.
[00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:24.431]  You know he went on 60 Minutes and said that it was the happiest time, happy making time, happiest time of his life, helping round up Jews, but he felt no responsibility for it, because if he wouldn't have done it, somebody else would.
[00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.092]  That it was an exhilarating feeling.
[00:23:29.175 --> 00:23:31.936]  This is the sickest crap I've ever heard in my life.
[00:23:33.396 --> 00:23:42.539]  And Soros used to be so megalomaniacal and on such a power trip that he would say to interviewers, I'm God.
[00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:43.720]  I am the Messiah.
[00:23:44.868 --> 00:23:59.514]  He pulled the interviews up in magazines, and then by the 90s he said, I used to tell people that I was the Messiah, because I believe I am the Messiah, and it was maybe something I shouldn't have been saying, but I am the Messiah.
[00:24:00.354 --> 00:24:01.795]  So, there it is.
[00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:05.045]  And it was the happy-making time.
[00:24:05.826 --> 00:24:07.487]  My best time of my life.
[00:24:07.507 --> 00:24:09.388]  It was exhilarating.
[00:24:09.468 --> 00:24:13.050]  It was great danger, but I was with my father.
[00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.412]  We were rounding up all the Jews, singing them off.
[00:24:19.013 --> 00:24:19.834]  Ah, so fun.
[00:24:20.134 --> 00:24:24.596]  And so the 60 Minutes interview was like, so you were helping round up your fellow Jews and sending them to death camps.
[00:24:25.477 --> 00:24:27.998]  Yes, I was, actually.
[00:24:28.578 --> 00:24:29.079]  Yes, I was.
[00:24:30.563 --> 00:24:33.344]  And so now in this upside-down world, I'm the bad guy.
[00:24:34.525 --> 00:24:35.745]  And Joe's the good guy.
[00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:41.768]  He's the guy that, from his little perch in Los Angeles, will tell us how to be good and how to be bad.
[00:24:41.788 --> 00:24:46.911]  Yes, there it is.
[00:24:48.311 --> 00:24:51.253]  George Soros, I carry potent messianic fantasies.
[00:24:55.754 --> 00:25:00.177]  I... Since I was a boy, I believed that I was the messiah.
[00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:07.020]  I think now it may be Alexander, my son.
[00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:10.042]  He is the messiah.
[00:25:11.342 --> 00:25:12.263]  The messiah!
[00:25:12.283 --> 00:25:13.063]  The messiah!
[00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:20.067]  So a Nazi collaborator thinks he's the messiah, who was a famous villain imploding countries and trying to overthrow their currencies.
[00:25:22.362 --> 00:25:25.723]  And I'm the bad guy for saying what he said on 60 Minutes.
[00:25:25.883 --> 00:25:26.423]  Okay, Joe.
[00:25:26.523 --> 00:25:26.763]  Cool.
[00:25:28.663 --> 00:25:31.104]  And they tell me I'm marked for destruction because I won't back down.
[00:25:31.244 --> 00:25:32.584]  Because I can't back down.
[00:25:33.084 --> 00:25:34.264]  These people are hurting children.
[00:25:37.025 --> 00:25:40.645]  The Soroses are heavily involved in all the Crowleyan magic crap.
[00:25:41.785 --> 00:25:42.205]  Look it up.
[00:25:43.006 --> 00:25:45.846]  Look up Alexander at spirit cooking events.
[00:25:47.026 --> 00:25:48.026]  It's disgusting.
[00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:50.447]  These are disgusting people.
[00:25:51.758 --> 00:25:59.004]  And to get close to God, you've got to politically and spiritually get away from these people.
[00:26:01.406 --> 00:26:07.672]  And by getting away from them, that means protecting children, protecting culture from the trash of the universe.
[00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:12.356]  The worst garbage that will do anything for power and control.
[00:26:12.816 --> 00:26:17.280]  And who only wants to destroy civilization in the name of civilization.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.761]  So I'm proud of the work I've done.
[00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:24.364]  And sometimes I get in war mode and I come off a little aggressive.
[00:26:24.705 --> 00:26:25.385]  Nobody's perfect.
[00:26:26.146 --> 00:26:31.651]  But you hype yourself up into these positions of no fear, that's the way it is.
[00:26:32.472 --> 00:26:46.264]  When you're fighting a global culture that is designed to destroy our genetics, vampirically, psychically, spiritually feed on our children, overthrow creation,
[00:26:49.212 --> 00:27:03.895]  Poison and destroy the earth in the name of saving it and folks don't know this has got to be opposed and when people become willing shills For the very worst aspects of Hollywood and Soros and others and then sit there and go.
[00:27:03.995 --> 00:27:07.176]  Oh Alex Jones is my friend But he's crazy.
[00:27:07.216 --> 00:27:07.676]  He's bad.
[00:27:07.716 --> 00:27:08.416]  He's in a lot of trouble.
[00:27:08.876 --> 00:27:17.638]  No Joe You're in a lot of trouble out there in Los Angeles with your wife and kids breathing all that toxic smog and being around all that evil If you had a soul left you'd feel it
[00:27:18.933 --> 00:27:24.675]  You already tried to get away once when you ran off to Colorado, but... They got you.
[00:27:26.076 --> 00:27:27.656]  And no, Joe, I don't think you're in the CIA.
[00:27:27.957 --> 00:27:37.600]  I said the whole DMT-Ayahuasca push is CIA, and almost all those guests you had on are admittedly working with the CIA at research facilities and at universities to do it.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.601]  Timothy Leary 2.0.
[00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:40.601]  So don't misrepresent what I said.
[00:27:41.282 --> 00:27:44.123]  And as a factoid, Eddie Bravo is not in the middle of this.
[00:27:45.423 --> 00:27:46.984]  At dinner a couple years ago, Eddie's like,
[00:27:48.792 --> 00:27:50.273]  Why doesn't Joe have you on the podcast?
[00:27:50.293 --> 00:27:51.393]  And I'm like, I'm not really worried about it.
[00:27:51.453 --> 00:27:52.874]  And he goes, well, I think he's been threatened.
[00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:54.695]  I think, you know, they've got to him.
[00:27:54.735 --> 00:27:55.856]  And I heard some stuff, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:57.617]  And I'm like, well, is that true?
[00:27:57.697 --> 00:28:01.959]  And he goes, no, actually, I just, well, I think he was threatened.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.581]  And then later, Eddie's like, no, no, no, that was just a hunch.
[00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:08.763]  So I went on air and said, Joe got threatened by the CIA, I heard.
[00:28:09.243 --> 00:28:10.864]  And Joe called up like an hour later, all mad.
[00:28:10.924 --> 00:28:13.245]  And I said, listen, I'll call Eddie.
[00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.187]  But the point is, it's like nitpicking on all this stuff.
[00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:20.592]  They're killing babies after they're born for years.
[00:28:21.372 --> 00:28:23.492]  Planned Parenthood and others are losing lawsuits.
[00:28:23.572 --> 00:28:26.653]  Law enforcement's figuring it out and going, how is that legal?
[00:28:27.254 --> 00:28:29.674]  So the indictments and arrests are starting to happen.
[00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:39.617]  So they need to have their front people, who are surgeons that are in that business and have to be governors, come out and say, we keep them little fellers comfortable for a while and then we kill them.
[00:28:40.037 --> 00:28:40.877]  You're like, well, why do you kill them?
[00:28:41.397 --> 00:28:43.018]  Um, well, um, yeah, let's not discuss that.
[00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:44.358]  Let's just say it's completely normal.
[00:28:44.618 --> 00:28:45.098]  Move along.
[00:28:45.118 --> 00:28:46.779]  These aren't the babies you're looking for.
[00:28:48.035 --> 00:28:48.496]  Move along.
[00:28:49.256 --> 00:28:50.438]  So it's all a Jedi mind trick.
[00:28:50.798 --> 00:28:57.866]  At the bottom of the spider hole that is that governor in Virginia is harvesting babies organs while they're alive.
[00:28:58.327 --> 00:28:58.767]  Period.
[00:28:59.148 --> 00:28:59.528]  Stay with us.
[00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:05.735]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:08.479]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:29:09.577 --> 00:29:10.558]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:15.902]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[00:29:16.002 --> 00:29:17.644]  I wanted to say I love your product.
[00:29:17.864 --> 00:29:20.226]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[00:29:20.907 --> 00:29:25.450]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:33.717]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain focus energy products were.
[00:29:34.378 --> 00:29:36.159]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.926]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:43.329]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:47.555]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[00:29:48.457 --> 00:29:52.843]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[00:29:53.464 --> 00:30:00.867]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market, get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:04.809]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of, that I'm going to use.
[00:30:05.249 --> 00:30:06.490]  It's up there as the very best.
[00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.892]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good, that have some of the similar ingredients.
[00:30:11.552 --> 00:30:14.513]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[00:30:15.674 --> 00:30:22.257]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[00:30:23.268 --> 00:30:23.448]  I don't
[00:30:43.732 --> 00:30:49.795]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[00:30:50.195 --> 00:30:53.977]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[00:30:54.517 --> 00:30:55.438]  Long burn.
[00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:57.679]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[00:30:57.739 --> 00:30:58.779]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:00.700]  And I take about a half a pack and it's so strong.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:06.643]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[00:31:07.386 --> 00:31:21.210]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:28.432]  It's 33% off, and you get it in the combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:28.892 --> 00:31:31.493]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[00:31:31.993 --> 00:31:36.314]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[00:31:37.327 --> 00:31:40.751]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[00:31:41.112 --> 00:31:42.673]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[00:31:43.214 --> 00:31:46.798]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:52.204]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[00:31:53.308 --> 00:32:01.098]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[00:32:01.438 --> 00:32:06.645]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[00:32:07.205 --> 00:32:10.570]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.501]  See what I mean?
[00:32:12.781 --> 00:32:20.731]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, you got your next phase, you get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:24.896]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[00:32:25.336 --> 00:32:26.157]  Boost in the morning!
[00:32:27.096 --> 00:32:32.297]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[00:32:32.998 --> 00:32:35.178]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[00:32:35.298 --> 00:32:38.159]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[00:32:38.179 --> 00:32:45.821]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:47.341]  And all thanks to TurboForce.
[00:32:48.042 --> 00:32:52.623]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[00:32:53.423 --> 00:32:57.665]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product, the InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:57.885 --> 00:32:59.386]  Get the energy combo today.
[00:32:59.646 --> 00:33:01.207]  Oh, and fund the InfoWar and change the world.
[00:33:01.407 --> 00:33:02.228]  I forgot about that part, too.
[00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:31.431 --> 00:33:34.593]  The devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal.
[00:33:34.613 --> 00:33:37.795]  He was in a bind, cause he was way behind and he was willing to make a deal.
[00:33:38.275 --> 00:33:41.317]  When he came across this young man sewing on a fiddle and playing it hot.
[00:33:41.797 --> 00:33:44.739]  And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said, boy, let me tell you what.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.341]  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too.
[00:33:48.942 --> 00:33:51.784]  And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.
[00:33:52.304 --> 00:33:55.446]  Now you play pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due.
[00:33:55.726 --> 00:33:58.688]  I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul, cause I think I'm better than you.
[00:33:59.498 --> 00:34:17.104]  When we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physicians, more than one physician by the way.
[00:34:17.924 --> 00:34:24.046]  And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that's non-viable.
[00:34:24.566 --> 00:34:30.131]  So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[00:34:30.931 --> 00:34:32.312]  The infant would be delivered.
[00:34:32.993 --> 00:34:34.594]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[00:34:35.435 --> 00:34:40.199]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:44.402]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[00:34:44.442 --> 00:34:47.204]  So I think this was really blown out of proportion.
[00:34:47.764 --> 00:34:50.947]  But again, we want the government not to be involved.
[00:34:51.147 --> 00:35:02.611]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:03.912]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:35:04.272 --> 00:35:08.193]  Let's get into the big central issue that has to be dealt with here.
[00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:18.177]  There is a massive, coordinated, criminal takeover of not just the Internet here in the U.S., but the Internet worldwide from Australia,
[00:35:19.195 --> 00:35:23.879]  To Europe, to the United States, to Canada, the same program is being implemented.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:40.913]  Nine months ago, ten months ago now, there was a 30-page Wall Street Journal article that Paul Watson wrote about that said, we're going to take WikiLeaks off and Alex Jones off, and once the precedent is set to take them off, we're going to start taking everybody off.
[00:35:41.634 --> 00:35:47.179]  And by the middle of 2019, most of the internet will be paid.
[00:35:48.334 --> 00:35:51.738]  Social networks will not promote any third-party news or information, period.
[00:35:52.038 --> 00:35:59.085]  Facebook announced they're going to stop letting farmers even have access to commenting on Facebook because they're the ones rebelling in France.
[00:35:59.325 --> 00:36:00.286]  That was in the news last week.
[00:36:00.347 --> 00:36:03.049]  BuzzFeed, actually, two weeks ago called for it.
[00:36:03.129 --> 00:36:04.271]  I mean, Soros called for it.
[00:36:07.622 --> 00:36:12.964]  Facebook responded saying, yes, we will not let farmers, French farmers, complain about anything.
[00:36:13.845 --> 00:36:17.967]  So see, now it goes from Alex Jones to French farmers complaining about gas prices.
[00:36:18.607 --> 00:36:18.967]  Period.
[00:36:20.508 --> 00:36:25.750]  Oh, and YouTube says they're going to get rid of the downvoting because we can't let you vote.
[00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:26.450]  That's hateful.
[00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:31.253]  And now, InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson article, key to get this out.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.881]  The EU just passed a law to begin criminalizing memes.
[00:36:35.141 --> 00:36:39.883]  BuzzFeed lobbies Twitter to ban memes that make fun of black-faced Democrats.
[00:36:40.724 --> 00:36:42.784]  If you can't meme, just get them censored.
[00:36:45.186 --> 00:36:48.747]  And you laugh at BuzzFeed, but it is a fake news weapon system.
[00:36:50.528 --> 00:36:57.231]  Continuing, Instagram apologizes for removing GOP spokeswoman's post about Senator Warren.
[00:36:58.697 --> 00:37:17.262]  They removed it and said it was hateful and warned her they might cancel her account because she showed Elizabeth Warren's bar card of Texas that she said she was Native American, which is a lie, and which she's now apologized for because 0.00000042 means she's about the whitest person on earth.
[00:37:17.962 --> 00:37:18.242]  Okay?
[00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:20.722]  I'm about 6% Native American.
[00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:21.863]  I wouldn't call myself Native American.
[00:37:22.103 --> 00:37:25.083]  You gotta be 13% for most tribes to say that you are.
[00:37:25.103 --> 00:37:25.143]  So.
[00:37:29.306 --> 00:37:33.588]  Instagram apologizes for removing GOP spokeswoman's post about Senator Warren.
[00:37:33.988 --> 00:37:35.129]  But that's Daily Caller.
[00:37:35.389 --> 00:37:38.690]  That's only when it's a high-level, top spokesperson.
[00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:39.831]  She gets pissed.
[00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:47.995]  She can go in to those mummies up there that don't know what's going on and say, look, I've been censored.
[00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:52.497]  Because they go and lie in Congress to their faces.
[00:37:52.557 --> 00:37:53.017]  I've been there.
[00:37:53.377 --> 00:37:54.398]  You've seen the live feeds.
[00:37:55.919 --> 00:37:59.362]  And they tell him, oh, no, no, no, nothing's going on.
[00:37:59.862 --> 00:38:00.603]  Nothing's happening.
[00:38:01.464 --> 00:38:12.072]  When, in industry publications, the New York Times and the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, this was all in industry publications a year ago.
[00:38:13.514 --> 00:38:15.035]  That, hey, our stock's going to go up.
[00:38:15.075 --> 00:38:17.277]  Hey, don't think the New York Times is going to fold.
[00:38:17.517 --> 00:38:19.879]  You know, Carlos Slim, the kingpin, just pulled out.
[00:38:21.297 --> 00:38:22.678]  We've got the cavalry on the way.
[00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:32.381]  It's big tech moguls are going to invest and they're going to force feed top search results to the New York Times and Washington Post so we'll be profitable again.
[00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:43.266]  And just like that, when they broke the algorithm and make you see CNN, make you see the New York Times, suddenly they aren't on live support anymore.
[00:38:44.466 --> 00:38:45.207]  Here's another article.
[00:38:45.608 --> 00:38:52.998]  Twitter locks Daily Caller's chief editor account over traumatizing learned code tweet.
[00:38:55.201 --> 00:38:56.022]  That's right, Twitter.
[00:38:56.946 --> 00:39:08.411]  Left bird droppings all over First Amendment after the Daily Caller's editor-in-chief was locked out of his Twitter account Tuesday night for tweeting, learned to code, an unfunny joke made by the Daily Show.
[00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.652]  Oh, the poor Daily Show.
[00:39:11.452 --> 00:39:18.575]  Weaponizing news, putting out propaganda in the name of entertainment, saying I'm a KKK member, all this made-up crap.
[00:39:19.015 --> 00:39:19.915]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:26.158]  You see, Twitter protected them from bullying and told the editor, you will remove that?
[00:39:27.526 --> 00:39:29.989]  Or we will suspend your account.
[00:39:31.491 --> 00:39:36.157]  That's what they told Goffrey Ingersoll.
[00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:44.267]  But then he refused and didn't back down, went public because he had a platform, and they backed down saying it was a mistake.
[00:39:45.376 --> 00:39:48.897]  And it was a joke about Trump saying this isn't symmetrical.
[00:39:49.557 --> 00:40:03.441]  Ha ha ha with a laugh track going because Pelosi was behind Trump seated playing with her dentures while Pence was standing up for not killing babies after they're born.
[00:40:03.541 --> 00:40:04.142]  Yes, that's right.
[00:40:04.222 --> 00:40:05.502]  She would not stand.
[00:40:08.609 --> 00:40:12.193]  But at least she didn't shake her head and look totally pissed like Cortez or Kamala Harris.
[00:40:12.394 --> 00:40:13.595]  These women are witches.
[00:40:13.955 --> 00:40:15.117]  Did witches exist before?
[00:40:15.137 --> 00:40:15.718]  I don't know.
[00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:20.824]  But big, powerful, evil women that get pissed when men try to not have newborn babies killed?
[00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.327]  That's called a witch!
[00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:25.970]  You know, Hansel and Gretel?
[00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:26.691]  You know, the witch?
[00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:28.133]  Wants to fatten them up for the oven?
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.521]  That's an old German fairy tale, but you know what?
[00:40:32.821 --> 00:40:34.482]  These people are real, man!
[00:40:35.202 --> 00:40:43.026]  They look downright pissed, shaking their heads, and sitting on their asses, when the president said nobody should kill a baby that's already born.
[00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:44.486]  Who the hell have we become?
[00:40:44.786 --> 00:40:52.070]  And these wetches, these pigs, shut up there and... Family show, family show, family show, family show.
[00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:54.871]  So don't worry.
[00:40:56.676 --> 00:40:59.078]  Imagine if a bunch of Republican women had dressed up in white.
[00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:00.600]  It'd have been, oh, KKK.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:06.966]  But when we say, oh, look at these people, the optics, they're so stupid, they want those banned.
[00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:13.372]  By the way, it was InfoWars that first pointed out that night, live coverage, that it looked like a KKK rally, and that we're also a Democratic Party.
[00:41:13.793 --> 00:41:15.234]  So we stuck some little hats on them.
[00:41:15.735 --> 00:41:16.756]  And again, that's why we're banned.
[00:41:16.796 --> 00:41:19.518]  Because, you know, the left can do whatever they want all day, call everybody Nazis.
[00:41:19.538 --> 00:41:20.759]  But it's the actual party.
[00:41:21.798 --> 00:41:31.105]  Of the KKK, and they're actually trying to infanticide all the babies, and, you know, their governor that is involved in infanticide of babies is, you know, dressed up in KKK outfits and blackface.
[00:41:33.147 --> 00:41:36.229]  You see, they don't want the meme out there because it's the truth!
[00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.451]  Not because it's a lie, but because it's the truth!
[00:41:41.173 --> 00:41:50.860]  And the big article when we come back with Mike Adams, because he just got censored, for defending Infowars, is they're coming for everybody, and I'm going to show you the New York Times admitting
[00:41:52.196 --> 00:41:58.363]  That the censorship has made them $700 million extra last year and they're finally profitable again after a decade.
[00:41:58.804 --> 00:42:08.235]  Yeah, because you rigged the whole damn internet after Silicon Valley invested in you in a big stinking illegal Federal Trade Commission monopoly violation.
[00:42:09.417 --> 00:42:10.218]  No different than
[00:42:12.366 --> 00:42:17.470]  The mafia, you know, rigging greyhound races, except you're killing America and killing our republic.
[00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:18.531]  You're doing it in the dark.
[00:42:19.332 --> 00:42:21.793]  Trying to shut us off so we're not there exposing you.
[00:42:22.394 --> 00:42:24.235]  Oh, there's more censorship and more threats.
[00:42:24.255 --> 00:42:27.698]  Democratic congressman tells black teen conservative, be afraid of us.
[00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:30.260]  We're coming for you.
[00:42:32.122 --> 00:42:33.323]  But here's the big article from Chris.
[00:42:34.622 --> 00:42:36.303]  Ben Ahan on Information Liberation.
[00:42:36.343 --> 00:42:37.424]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:37.704 --> 00:42:38.965]  The spoils of censorship.
[00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:43.108]  New York Times raked in 709 million extra digital revenue in 2018.
[00:42:43.369 --> 00:42:50.534]  And then right here in the article, we actually have them bragging how after they censored everybody, they were able to make the money.
[00:42:50.894 --> 00:42:54.037]  Admitting their giant mafia crimes out in the open.
[00:42:54.357 --> 00:43:02.043]  Government, corporations, and big tech all together to game the entire internet, steal all the traffic, shut down their competition.
[00:43:09.332 --> 00:43:10.833]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[00:43:10.873 --> 00:43:12.215]  She was talking about the Virginia governor.
[00:43:12.715 --> 00:43:13.616]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:15.417]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[00:43:15.457 --> 00:43:15.878]  What do you think?
[00:43:16.458 --> 00:43:17.319]  I hope so.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.741]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[00:43:19.981 --> 00:43:27.988]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him, and that was a big... I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[00:43:28.288 --> 00:43:30.468]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[00:43:30.488 --> 00:43:42.891]  I can't really do his fake Southern accent, but it's just, I love Southerners, you know, I'm from Texas, kind of Southern, but it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area, kill that baby.
[00:43:43.071 --> 00:43:53.653]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people, you know, kind of responding to that voice he does, but it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[00:43:53.713 --> 00:43:55.693]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[00:43:56.854 --> 00:43:58.435]  Oh my gosh, it's so sickening.
[00:43:58.516 --> 00:44:01.138]  Well, we know in the end times this is the stuff that happens.
[00:44:01.198 --> 00:44:06.223]  That's why I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[00:44:06.423 --> 00:44:08.746]  And I love, I wanted to say I love your products.
[00:44:08.986 --> 00:44:12.329]  I have X2 and the Selenium for my thyroid and
[00:44:12.329 --> 00:44:14.212]  I have to say that it's worked wonders.
[00:44:14.292 --> 00:44:16.635]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[00:44:16.936 --> 00:44:27.551]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does and usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue and that helps tremendously and the knockout helps
[00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:33.858]  We sleep at night, especially when I have something important I have to get up and do in the morning and I don't feel that groggy feeling.
[00:44:33.958 --> 00:44:35.180]  And we use the toothpaste.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.441]  We love the toothpaste.
[00:44:36.521 --> 00:44:40.185]  My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with.
[00:44:40.225 --> 00:44:42.788]  My husband is a hardwood floor installer.
[00:44:42.828 --> 00:44:46.072]  He loves the bodies and he loves the Red Pill Plus.
[00:44:46.172 --> 00:44:48.034]  And we're going to try the Turbo Force next.
[00:44:48.374 --> 00:44:53.361]  I really want to get that turbo force because my son loves going to the gym and he needs something for a booze.
[00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:56.004]  Well, Jessie, I appreciate your support, but let me be honest with you.
[00:44:56.104 --> 00:44:57.486]  Only take a half pack at the first time.
[00:44:57.586 --> 00:44:59.489]  It's just, it's kind of like good crack.
[00:44:59.689 --> 00:45:01.691]  So, I'm almost embarrassed.
[00:45:02.152 --> 00:45:03.334]  Everybody should be careful with it.
[00:45:03.774 --> 00:45:04.475]  It's the next level.
[00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:04.976]  It's insane.
[00:45:05.316 --> 00:45:19.346]  Really I'm glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty and I don't know what where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you on air who have just stayed strong through it all.
[00:45:19.366 --> 00:45:20.347]  So I just want to encourage you
[00:45:20.487 --> 00:45:24.850]  Just to keep going, keep fighting for us and with us because I don't know.
[00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:26.172]  I don't know what we would do.
[00:45:26.212 --> 00:45:27.292]  We wouldn't have anybody.
[00:45:27.312 --> 00:45:31.356]  If there wasn't you, I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[00:45:31.496 --> 00:45:38.281]  Like you said, you're the tip of the spear, so I really appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth.
[00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:47.969]  It helps me to stay connected to God and I can't say enough about how much I love InfoWars, how much I love the products, but I would like to have some female cut shirts.
[00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.092]  No, no, I totally agree.
[00:45:51.913 --> 00:45:54.836]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt and it was a big hit.
[00:45:54.977 --> 00:45:55.898]  And we're just brain dead.
[00:45:55.918 --> 00:45:57.700]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.381]  It's from women.
[00:45:58.401 --> 00:46:00.323]  We've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females.
[00:46:00.383 --> 00:46:01.344]  We will get it done for you.
[00:46:01.384 --> 00:46:03.427]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on.
[00:46:03.607 --> 00:46:04.929]  And your husband and your family.
[00:46:05.049 --> 00:46:06.470]  Because just hearing what's in your voice.
[00:46:07.011 --> 00:46:10.153]  The powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together.
[00:46:10.373 --> 00:46:14.034]  All of us focused together against the globalists is unstoppable.
[00:46:14.415 --> 00:46:18.937]  And that's why they're attacking that sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[00:46:19.217 --> 00:46:20.157]  We are humanity.
[00:46:20.437 --> 00:46:21.398]  We are the experience.
[00:46:21.438 --> 00:46:22.198]  We are everything.
[00:46:22.639 --> 00:46:24.439]  And so you've just got my commitment to fight on.
[00:46:24.459 --> 00:46:26.720]  But let me tell you, I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.301]  I'm burnt out.
[00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:29.622]  Hearing you, I don't want to just say this.
[00:46:29.742 --> 00:46:30.462]  I'm not just telling you this.
[00:46:30.983 --> 00:46:32.063]  You are the info war.
[00:46:32.163 --> 00:46:33.464]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[00:46:34.164 --> 00:46:38.305]  And that's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth.
[00:46:38.426 --> 00:46:39.506]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[00:46:39.606 --> 00:46:43.207]  If you weren't here, standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:44.548]  But we're in this together.
[00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:46.368]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:49.790]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic gremlin governor.
[00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.350]  Of course he's KKK.
[00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:53.611]  Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[00:46:53.651 --> 00:46:55.111]  That's what that's all really about.
[00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:56.712]  These are demons.
[00:46:57.232 --> 00:46:58.733]  But thanks to you and others, we're going to win.
[00:46:58.793 --> 00:46:59.453]  Thank you so much.
[00:47:06.912 --> 00:47:09.576]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.051]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:47:29.051 --> 00:47:30.452]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:30.712 --> 00:47:32.032]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:32.492 --> 00:47:38.794]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.915 --> 00:47:45.216]  So, Congress is not acting on the greatest censorship to ever hit the Western world.
[00:47:45.236 --> 00:47:51.978]  And so, the tyrants have tested the perch.
[00:47:54.031 --> 00:47:56.734]  And they've done their beta test and so now all hell's breaking loose.
[00:47:57.395 --> 00:48:00.078]  Censorship, never-before-seen, total social engineering.
[00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:05.024]  Where if you play ball, you get left online for a season.
[00:48:06.305 --> 00:48:14.575]  But by the end of this year, they plan to have almost phased everybody out to where if you want to even do anything on Facebook or anywhere, you're gonna have to pay.
[00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:24.395]  And so they get you on a communication system that they control, that has no transparency, and then they start slowly putting the screws to you.
[00:48:25.376 --> 00:48:31.942]  We're going to talk to Mike Adams, who just got massively censored for what he said about Bitcoin and Jack Dorsey and the fraud.
[00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:38.689]  I know Joe Rogan's reached out a couple times wanting to talk on the phone, and I just don't know if I can...
[00:48:39.964 --> 00:48:45.449]  I just couldn't bring myself to call or pick the phone up last night, and I'm not trying to act tough here.
[00:48:45.629 --> 00:48:50.454]  Actually, the guy's a charming fellow, and I've liked him in certain ways, but I just have to.
[00:48:50.914 --> 00:48:53.356]  This is about my soul, and it's not for sale.
[00:48:54.317 --> 00:48:56.879]  And yes, I'm in war mode.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.020]  People need to understand that.
[00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:05.727]  And so I do get a little aggressive, and I may have even said some things that are over the line to Joe.
[00:49:07.401 --> 00:49:09.462]  He said a whole hell of a lot of stuff about me that isn't true.
[00:49:09.983 --> 00:49:11.043]  And it isn't about me!
[00:49:11.624 --> 00:49:16.727]  Jimmy Savelle did have sex with hundreds of dead bodies, and did murder children, and did supply them to British elite.
[00:49:16.927 --> 00:49:18.088]  That's mainstream news, Joe!
[00:49:19.669 --> 00:49:28.574]  So just because you can't handle it, and you sit up there and say, I'm making that up, when in ten seconds you can confirm what I said was true, you say, I'm in a bad place, Joe?
[00:49:29.615 --> 00:49:30.515]  We're in a bad place.
[00:49:30.535 --> 00:49:32.336]  And I believe this should be the number one Republican ad.
[00:49:32.737 --> 00:49:35.058]  It's what Trump should stand on if they have any sense.
[00:49:35.498 --> 00:49:36.159]  And it's the right thing to do.
[00:49:37.625 --> 00:49:47.391]  Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Cortez refused to stand in defense of already born babies not being infanticide.
[00:49:48.592 --> 00:49:53.274]  I mean, that is like, if Jeffrey Dahmer was in court trying to get out of prison time, he'd stand up.
[00:49:53.895 --> 00:49:57.137]  Mr. Dahmer, I'm about to sentence you to life in prison or death.
[00:49:57.657 --> 00:50:03.901]  Now tell me what you did to those children, torturing them and raping them and killing them was wrong, and that you are sorry.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:05.921]  I am not sorry.
[00:50:06.321 --> 00:50:07.302]  I am Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:50:07.783 --> 00:50:09.304]  He would get executed.
[00:50:09.784 --> 00:50:17.692]  But, you can have Pelosi, in plain view, refusing to get up, and all these witches, and then it wasn't just that.
[00:50:18.593 --> 00:50:19.874]  It was the human trafficking.
[00:50:19.914 --> 00:50:20.755]  It was the kidnapping.
[00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:22.416]  They were pissed.
[00:50:23.537 --> 00:50:25.880]  We've gotten thousands of women and children out of sex slavery.
[00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:32.841]  And they're just like, oh, and it just goes on and on and on.
[00:50:32.861 --> 00:50:33.722]  We're going to Mike Adams.
[00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:34.343]  I've got a plug.
[00:50:34.363 --> 00:50:34.904]  We won't be here.
[00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:37.502]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:50:37.582 --> 00:50:38.443]  I'm in the fight of my life.
[00:50:38.523 --> 00:50:39.684]  These are great products anyways.
[00:50:40.024 --> 00:50:40.925]  Thank you for the support.
[00:50:41.946 --> 00:50:43.187]  Please support our local stations.
[00:50:43.247 --> 00:50:44.508]  Support their local sponsors.
[00:50:44.648 --> 00:50:45.429]  Become a sponsor.
[00:50:45.989 --> 00:50:49.072]  And please, please spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:50:49.152 --> 00:50:51.854]  However you're listening or watching, you're how we get past the censors.
[00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:54.697]  I know you get punished for promoting us, so do it via email.
[00:50:54.757 --> 00:50:56.538]  Do it via text message to everybody you know.
[00:50:56.939 --> 00:50:57.619]  Send them articles.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.281]  You are the eyes and ears.
[00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:00.242]  You are the legs.
[00:51:00.322 --> 00:51:02.484]  You are the guts, the blood, the muscle, the brains.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.201]  Of the true Americana relaunch.
[00:51:05.261 --> 00:51:05.641]  We're it.
[00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:13.687]  The globalists are attacking us because we're men who are loyal to the country and to unborn children and to born children and to decency.
[00:51:13.767 --> 00:51:22.252]  We will not be overrun by a operating system that is, by any analysis, by any real military, you'd say is not human.
[00:51:22.713 --> 00:51:26.575]  I don't know what the hell's going on and the globalists think they're in contact with off-world stuff.
[00:51:26.856 --> 00:51:30.378]  I'm just telling you, if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is a duck.
[00:51:30.458 --> 00:51:31.479]  And this is the message
[00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:33.860]  I've been told that is the most censored.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.400]  That there is a death cult attack on the planet.
[00:51:37.061 --> 00:51:39.141]  That the orders have gone out.
[00:51:39.241 --> 00:51:41.222]  And when Mike Adams said that, he got banned too.
[00:51:41.702 --> 00:51:45.123]  Because it's the announcement that 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:51:46.384 --> 00:51:49.705]  No, it's the announcement that we don't kill babies after they're born.
[00:51:52.126 --> 00:51:52.606]  That's wrong.
[00:51:53.026 --> 00:51:54.286]  Now you can't even say that.
[00:51:54.306 --> 00:51:55.107]  So we'll go to Mike Adams.
[00:51:55.127 --> 00:51:55.587]  Just please.
[00:51:56.872 --> 00:51:57.853]  We've got products you need.
[00:51:58.333 --> 00:52:01.695]  Air filtration, water filtration, whatever the best systems are, we go out and get it discounted.
[00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:03.096]  High quality, storable foods.
[00:52:03.116 --> 00:52:05.697]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:52:06.037 --> 00:52:11.821]  InfoWars Life, Brain Synergy Combo, the Great Nootropic, naturally gives you good focus and clarity.
[00:52:12.341 --> 00:52:12.802]  I don't think so.
[00:52:28.164 --> 00:52:34.030]  We believe it's one of the best formulas out there and it's way cheaper than some of the other ones out there that aren't even as good.
[00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:38.794]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:52:38.814 --> 00:52:41.076]  But whatever you do, please support us.
[00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:43.278]  Now, you just heard me get into all the censorship earlier.
[00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:45.761]  Just today, a small sampling of it.
[00:52:46.542 --> 00:52:50.245]  And now ban Republicans, ban Congress people, ban any memes.
[00:52:50.285 --> 00:52:51.787]  Just ban, ban, ban, ban.
[00:52:51.967 --> 00:52:53.188]  Don't let French farmers do anything.
[00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:56.411]  And then you've got Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[00:52:56.431 --> 00:53:03.479]  He comes on, he promotes InfoWars, and oh, they just let him know, hey, here's a little rap on the head, a little slap in the face, a little psh psh psh psh.
[00:53:03.999 --> 00:53:05.380]  We're going to restrict you now.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.300]  We're going to ban you.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.663]  We're going to terminate you for daring to speak of our Lord and Savior, Jack Dorsey.
[00:53:11.723 --> 00:53:14.245]  So, tell us what happened, Mike.
[00:53:15.743 --> 00:53:24.330]  Alex, in the hours after my appearance on your show yesterday, all three accounts that we use on Twitter were suspended simultaneously.
[00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:29.234]  That's the Health Ranger account, the Real Natural News account, and the News Target account.
[00:53:29.895 --> 00:53:33.938]  And obviously a manual suspension, obviously from Jack Dorsey.
[00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:37.880]  Maybe Joe Rogan promoted it two doors, who knows?
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:46.444]  But the point is, they have punished me for appearing on your show, they've punished me for off-platform behavior.
[00:53:46.684 --> 00:53:50.946]  So if you look at the tweets from the Health Ranger account, just, it's at Health Ranger,
[00:53:51.506 --> 00:53:58.108]  You can see that it's over 95% health, nutrition, food science, you know, food contamination science.
[00:53:59.668 --> 00:54:01.189]  That's what we tweak there all the time.
[00:54:01.529 --> 00:54:03.109]  We don't even get into politics on that channel.
[00:54:03.429 --> 00:54:05.890]  But that channel was banned because I appeared on your show.
[00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.970]  And secondly, Alex, this is really crucial.
[00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:14.052]  If you think about it, you and I were discussing what I now believe to be massive securities fraud.
[00:54:14.692 --> 00:54:18.873]  A conspiracy being carried out by Joe Rogan and Jack Dorsey.
[00:54:19.562 --> 00:54:24.644]  Where they are not disclosing their financial conflicts of interest, as is required by the SEC.
[00:54:25.224 --> 00:54:33.447]  They are engaging in what I believe to be a con, a massive scam that could ensnare millions of innocent people.
[00:54:33.867 --> 00:54:40.649]  And they are silencing the independent journalists, such as myself and you, who are looking into that massive financial fraud.
[00:54:40.669 --> 00:54:42.970]  So, they are a techno-mafia.
[00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:44.911]  We're living under techno-fascism.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:57.087]  Independent journalists who are whistleblowers are being silenced in order to cover up what I believe to be serious SEC crimes or violations that are with cryptocurrency.
[00:54:57.347 --> 00:54:58.608]  That's what's going on right now, Alex.
[00:54:58.688 --> 00:55:05.092]  And they just proved it by banning all of my accounts all at the same time, hours after I appeared on your show.
[00:55:05.532 --> 00:55:09.555]  And if you recall yesterday on your show, I said this is what they do to people.
[00:55:10.313 --> 00:55:12.915]  They reward you if you denounce Alex Jones.
[00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:16.679]  They punish you if you say that Alex Jones has a right to speak.
[00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:18.501]  And they just proved it yet again.
[00:55:20.102 --> 00:55:20.723]  It's crazy.
[00:55:20.923 --> 00:55:29.130]  And of course, even mainline sites like Hacked and others said the dark side of Joe Rogan, Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin promotion.
[00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:34.776]  And he's not telling you that the single currency for the square cash system
[00:55:35.636 --> 00:55:37.438]  He is the main sponsor of Joe.
[00:55:37.778 --> 00:55:58.837]  And so when you have that trifecta of Joe not disclosing it, which he didn't, he tried to back it up later, no he didn't, and which they didn't break down, and the fact that he's saying we need a single currency, and he thinks it's going to go back up, and he thinks it's going to be the best in the world, he's there literally talking up securities he's heavily invested in, in a trifecta at every level.
[00:55:59.058 --> 00:56:01.680]  What Jack Dorsey did, what Rogan did, is textbook.
[00:56:02.725 --> 00:56:19.234]  According to Hacked.com reports, Joe Rogan is being paid about $300,000 a month to promote the cash app that's owned by Twitter and being pushed by Jack Dorsey, and yet they do not disclose this to their audience.
[00:56:19.394 --> 00:56:29.784]  You know, according to SEC violations or rules, these are criminal offenses that could be prosecuted, but must be investigated at the very least by independent journalists.
[00:56:30.144 --> 00:56:33.287]  And yet it's those same independent journalists who are being silenced.
[00:56:33.587 --> 00:56:36.190]  So what we're dealing with here, Alex, as you know very well,
[00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:52.176]  It is a mafia, a techno-mafia that both pushes what I believe to be financial scams and Ponzi schemes and then silences the independent journalists who are attempting to investigate and honestly report on those financial schemes.
[00:56:52.556 --> 00:56:54.517]  This is fascism, techno-fascism.
[00:56:54.897 --> 00:56:56.358]  Jack Dorsey is running it.
[00:56:56.918 --> 00:56:58.879]  Joe Rogan is a front man for it.
[00:56:59.239 --> 00:57:02.340]  That's clear to me now, especially after what happened yesterday.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:08.683]  There's no reason for me to be banned off Twitter other than the fact that I spoke out on your show, Alex.
[00:57:09.143 --> 00:57:21.768]  That's what it's all about, and this is a message to be sent to anyone else who dares to speak out, that you will be censored, you'll be defamed, lied about, smeared, economically sabotaged, cut off from your revenue streams.
[00:57:22.188 --> 00:57:23.248]  But you know, guess what?
[00:57:23.969 --> 00:57:24.669]  They can't turn me.
[00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:27.472]  I'm not surrendering to these tyrants.
[00:57:27.832 --> 00:57:29.213]  I'm going to continue to do the research.
[00:57:29.253 --> 00:57:35.577]  I'm going to continue to engage in investigative journalism and continue to report the truth on your show and elsewhere.
[00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:36.158]  Good job.
[00:57:36.298 --> 00:57:39.160]  Well, let's come back and talk about this, Mike, because we're counter punchers.
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:39.800]  We don't attack.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.281]  We defend.
[00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:43.803]  But they have no idea how many places we're about to hit them.
[00:57:44.684 --> 00:57:46.105]  And so, hey, I know we're already at war.
[00:57:46.145 --> 00:57:46.745]  You're attacking us.
[00:57:46.946 --> 00:57:47.546]  Just get ready.
[00:57:47.706 --> 00:57:48.427]  Just get ready.
[00:57:48.607 --> 00:57:50.108]  Oh, just get ready now.
[00:57:50.268 --> 00:57:51.529]  Now, now, now, now.
[00:57:53.322 --> 00:58:00.669]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best selling, highest rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:07.115]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[00:58:07.155 --> 00:58:11.460]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:27.654]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label the product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[00:58:28.294 --> 00:58:35.158]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[00:58:35.758 --> 00:58:37.379]  But the announcement here today is this.
[00:58:38.099 --> 00:58:41.581]  We've been selling a lot of the Wound Gel and a lot of the Immune Garment.
[00:58:42.001 --> 00:58:44.283]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[00:58:45.063 --> 00:58:55.817]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[00:58:56.478 --> 00:59:02.186]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis,
[00:59:02.786 --> 00:59:11.390]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:12.750]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:13.111 --> 00:59:17.012]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[00:59:17.032 --> 00:59:22.955]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[00:59:23.755 --> 00:59:27.097]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[00:59:27.357 --> 00:59:32.040]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:39.805]  That when there's a crisis and people really need something and want it, I'm going to sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[00:59:40.165 --> 00:59:50.711]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off, as a combo, or 40% off, individually, all supplies last, at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:59:57.421 --> 01:00:01.383]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:18.812]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:19.252 --> 01:00:21.613]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.674 --> 01:00:25.235]  I want to explain something to the globalists.
[01:00:26.032 --> 01:00:27.292]  I want to tell you something, they're minions.
[01:00:29.573 --> 01:00:32.013]  I know you guys make these deals mainly out of fear.
[01:00:32.033 --> 01:00:37.014]  And at first, you know, you give in to some pressure, and then it's more, more, more, more, more.
[01:00:37.455 --> 01:00:38.635]  And then you're a kept creature.
[01:00:41.996 --> 01:00:47.077]  But you're going to be like the people hanging off the helicopters, kids, in Saigon when it fell in 1974.
[01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:51.438]  I mean, that's where this is going.
[01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:54.219]  The globalist program is meant to fail.
[01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:55.580]  It's meant to bring us all down.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:04.824]  And you think you're parlaying yourself into some, you know, position, but now the position doesn't look so good when what I told you ten years ago is now mainstream news.
[01:01:06.585 --> 01:01:18.150]  Eight years after I said it, two years ago, they started reporting elite secret airstrips all over New Zealand, Tasmania, Kauai, underground bunkers, multiple year food supplies, and
[01:01:19.798 --> 01:01:22.120]  Most of these globalists have already moved their families out.
[01:01:23.641 --> 01:01:27.483]  So, wow, you've really set up something really, really nice and really sustainable.
[01:01:28.444 --> 01:01:28.704]  Not.
[01:01:29.464 --> 01:01:30.785]  So Mike's with us two more segments.
[01:01:31.526 --> 01:01:35.428]  Mike, you know, it's not just that I know Joe Rogan or he didn't have me back on his podcast.
[01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:41.272]  It's that I wasn't paying attention to him for years because I'm so busy and my listeners are like, dude, this guy's bad news.
[01:01:41.933 --> 01:01:43.434]  So then when he started really trashing me,
[01:01:45.089 --> 01:01:49.270]  I started actually watching and like every time I watched it was some horrible globalist scam.
[01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:52.371]  And I was like, this guy's literally turned into a snake.
[01:01:52.411 --> 01:01:53.331]  Maybe he was always one.
[01:01:53.351 --> 01:01:55.912]  So this isn't personal with the Joe Rogan thing.
[01:01:56.532 --> 01:02:00.614]  It's just that I've got to not have any sacred cows just because I've been friends with somebody.
[01:02:00.954 --> 01:02:08.676]  And I respect the fact that you have that leadership characteristic that that's what this is all about is doing what's hard, Mike.
[01:02:09.858 --> 01:02:17.543]  Well, what you and I have both come to learn is that the only people that we can trust are people who are being persecuted by the establishment.
[01:02:17.624 --> 01:02:28.871]  And that's actually, being censored by Twitter, being de-platformed, really actually gives you authority or credibility, I should say, with the real people of the world.
[01:02:29.432 --> 01:02:35.016]  Those who are never censored, those who are promoted, are the snakes and the liars and the deceivers.
[01:02:36.117 --> 01:02:44.548]  But being shut off, being shadow banned, and being deplatformed, economically sabotaged, remember this is all part of how they attack you.
[01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:49.996]  First they smear you, they lie about you on purpose, and then they silence your ability to defend yourself.
[01:02:50.504 --> 01:02:52.186]  And this is what they do to Trump.
[01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:54.449]  This is what they've done to you for many years.
[01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:58.954]  You know, the lies about you are, I mean, the only person they've lied about more is President Trump.
[01:02:59.474 --> 01:03:01.296]  But they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:03:01.476 --> 01:03:03.298]  I'm talking about the media establishment.
[01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:04.400]  They know what they're doing.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.761]  They know that you can't defend yourself.
[01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:07.243]  They know that if you try to defend yourself,
[01:03:07.763 --> 01:03:30.468]  You will be shadow banned and they know that most people actually, not your listeners, but sort of the brainwashed public can be easily influenced and swayed by disinfo from the New York Times or CNN or, you know, USA Today, whatever, or even even people like Joe Rogan, by the way, who it's not too late for Joe, you know, he could still be a champion for humanity if he would reject
[01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:36.934]  These dark, destructive forces that actually come out for humanity and speak out for humanity.
[01:03:37.934 --> 01:03:39.114]  People can change.
[01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:39.935]  People can grow.
[01:03:41.055 --> 01:03:42.355]  You and I have grown over the years.
[01:03:42.415 --> 01:03:49.637]  We've become more prominent in our defense of human liberty, human life, opposing abortion, all of that.
[01:03:49.677 --> 01:03:51.458]  We're just more firm now than ever.
[01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:53.158]  But you see, that's what happens.
[01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:55.179]  You have this polarization.
[01:03:55.579 --> 01:03:58.721]  People either go to extreme evil or they go to extreme good.
[01:03:59.161 --> 01:04:05.064]  And at this point, Alex, it's very clear who is with God and who's with Satan at this point.
[01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:06.465]  That's what's becoming clear now.
[01:04:06.505 --> 01:04:13.328]  The mask is off, the demons are out, and you can tell who's defending life versus who is destroying life.
[01:04:14.129 --> 01:04:14.749]  It's all clear now.
[01:04:16.648 --> 01:04:26.333]  And again, we're going to roll the footage when we come back with the audio of Trump saying we should not kill babies after they're born and Pelosi refusing to stand up.
[01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:28.574]  That clip is coming up.
[01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:29.314]  We start the next segment.
[01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:31.318]  Think about these people.
[01:04:31.398 --> 01:04:40.043]  I know you've got to go to break shortly, but if these people would kill their own babies, do you think they wouldn't kill you, or conservatives, or Christians, or gun owners, or Trump supporters?
[01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:47.206]  Mass murder is what's next on the agenda, and the censorship is the prelude to the mass murder that's coming.
[01:04:49.554 --> 01:04:52.656]  You're absolutely right, and it's just beyond chilling.
[01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:59.880]  It's absolutely confirmation that not once, not twice, not three times, but over and over again when they said, let's stop killing babies after they're born.
[01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:02.322]  We just saved a bunch of women from sex slavery.
[01:05:05.222 --> 01:05:11.787]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the Brain Synergy Combo is here.

[01:06:18.294 --> 01:06:23.538]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:39.249]  There's a moment in history where cultures, nations, peoples, civilizations decide whether they're going to go on and continue or whether they're going to collapse.
[01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:43.332]  And now, our entire world
[01:06:44.855 --> 01:06:45.916]  is in that position.
[01:06:46.696 --> 01:06:49.218]  Humanity is choosing its destiny.
[01:06:50.019 --> 01:06:51.940]  The censorship is accelerating.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.102]  The Chinese social score is expanding to America.
[01:06:56.023 --> 01:07:04.209]  The establishment is flexing its will to vertically integrate the economy and then force its anti-human directives upon us.
[01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:08.812]  But then there's that moment when the governor of Virginia
[01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:12.934]  Says we kill babies after they're born.
[01:07:12.974 --> 01:07:16.796]  We keep them alive because they're taking their organs and everybody starts going away.
[01:07:16.836 --> 01:07:17.937]  That's illegal to kill a baby.
[01:07:18.938 --> 01:07:20.859]  It was a baby before, but it was a baby after.
[01:07:20.899 --> 01:07:24.201]  But now, as we were always told, now it's infanticide.
[01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.482]  And then he defends it.
[01:07:26.503 --> 01:07:34.208]  And then I don't think big league politics was part of this, but clearly that was in the dirt file on the governor to keep control of it.
[01:07:34.448 --> 01:07:35.549]  They had that the whole time.
[01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:38.731]  In fact, fraternities and groups get you to do that.
[01:07:39.191 --> 01:07:40.252]  So they've got the guts.
[01:07:41.272 --> 01:07:42.653]  One week, you're having sex with a sheep.
[01:07:42.753 --> 01:07:45.174]  The next week, you're having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
[01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:47.676]  A couple years later, it's a 5-year-old kid.
[01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:51.257]  And, well, next you gotta kill a kid.
[01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:53.899]  So, that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:54.679 --> 01:08:04.464]  And, so they were so scared of the people seeing behind the veil of how they're harvesting these organs, because he slipped up, that they went ahead and said, get in this file and link it to some right-wing group.
[01:08:05.284 --> 01:08:09.407]  Which I'm glad it came out, but it became a smoke screen for the rest of the story.
[01:08:09.447 --> 01:08:10.007]  There's a playbook.
[01:08:11.169 --> 01:08:11.649]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:11.669 --> 01:08:12.749]  Trump's on the trail.
[01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.590]  And so he's there saying, we've saved these thousands of women and children.
[01:08:19.531 --> 01:08:20.751]  The Democrat women won't get up.
[01:08:21.411 --> 01:08:22.371]  Cortez won't get up.
[01:08:24.532 --> 01:08:25.432]  Pelosi won't get up.
[01:08:26.072 --> 01:08:27.132]  Talks about dead babies.
[01:08:27.172 --> 01:08:28.653]  We shouldn't kill babies after they're born.
[01:08:29.033 --> 01:08:29.913]  Pelosi looks pissed.
[01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:30.473]  Won't get up.
[01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:32.413]  Daily Show makes jokes about it.
[01:08:33.374 --> 01:08:34.034]  People are like, wait a minute.
[01:08:34.054 --> 01:08:35.434]  You're talking about killing babies after they're born.
[01:08:35.454 --> 01:08:36.794]  This is... You see?
[01:08:36.994 --> 01:08:38.655]  Because these are sick, evil people.
[01:08:39.835 --> 01:08:46.864]  And they know you've got a conscience, so that's why they always tell you you're being bad, because they know that you have that place to talk, oh, I did something wrong?
[01:08:47.164 --> 01:08:54.253]  When these people have no authority over you, and they literally hate you and want to kill you, that's their wavelength, that's their broadcast.
[01:08:54.473 --> 01:08:55.995]  They've shunk to pure evil.
[01:08:56.696 --> 01:09:00.899]  Like Mike said earlier, you either resonate becoming better and better, or you sink.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:13.469]  And the enemy knows that, and they know the planet wants to resonate with God, wants to go to the next level, wants to literally have clear, focused understanding and real light, not deception.
[01:09:14.752 --> 01:09:18.895]  Alex, I want to point out, they've also legalized the torture of these infants.
[01:09:18.975 --> 01:09:19.715]  Think about this.
[01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:24.158]  There are no limitations on the method of killing them that is now legal in New York.
[01:09:24.198 --> 01:09:27.100]  And I don't mean to get graphic, but the method... No, we have to do it.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.121]  Get into the methods.
[01:09:29.141 --> 01:09:30.161]  They can stomp on it.
[01:09:30.241 --> 01:09:32.703]  They can use a pair of scissors, a scalpel.
[01:09:33.043 --> 01:09:34.364]  They could suffocate it to death.
[01:09:34.384 --> 01:09:36.165]  They could put a plastic bag over its head.
[01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:42.068]  Look, there are no limits to how they can kill this baby because they do not define it as a living baby.
[01:09:42.108 --> 01:09:49.972]  They define it as an unviable tissue mass and there's no law in their minds against torturing a piece of tissue.
[01:09:50.212 --> 01:09:50.872]  So think about this.
[01:09:50.912 --> 01:09:54.654]  They've legalized the torture of babies, Alex, not just killing them.
[01:09:55.415 --> 01:09:59.141]  And you're absolutely right, that's in the bill, that's in the law, the same law in Virginia.
[01:09:59.201 --> 01:10:06.513]  This is their pushback to us saying don't kill babies in the 7th, 8th, 9th month that are viable, they can be up for adoption, at least inform the women.
[01:10:06.893 --> 01:10:07.274]  Oh no no!
[01:10:08.177 --> 01:10:08.918]  We're good to go.
[01:10:29.518 --> 01:10:33.021]  Or, some places are so evil and into it, they kick the baby around.
[01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:34.622]  That's been in law enforcement reports.
[01:10:35.142 --> 01:10:36.984]  Or, they throw them in a bucket of water.
[01:10:37.324 --> 01:10:45.290]  And then sometimes, there's famous cases where nurses are so hurt, who aren't part of that part of the facility, that they get the baby out of the water.
[01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:51.695]  Because some babies can, you know, still even fight in that position, and in survival instinct, and they run out and hide the baby.
[01:10:52.135 --> 01:10:54.817]  There's been famous cases where famous people have been dug out of dumpsters.
[01:10:56.167 --> 01:11:00.568]  And we have, you know, in addition to this Twitter censorship, we were contacted by Apple.
[01:11:00.888 --> 01:11:02.548]  This has been going on now for about two weeks.
[01:11:02.768 --> 01:11:09.690]  And they sent us a list of articles that they say we are not allowed to publish or they will ban our app with Apple.
[01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:14.311]  And one of the categories that they say we cannot talk about is abortion.
[01:11:14.751 --> 01:11:18.112]  And the other category, believe it or not, Alex, is Satanism.
[01:11:18.512 --> 01:11:24.993]  So Apple is telling Natural News that we're not allowed to talk about abortion or Satanism.
[01:11:25.453 --> 01:11:27.115]  Or they will ban our app.
[01:11:27.255 --> 01:11:27.936]  Let's stop right there.
[01:11:27.956 --> 01:11:28.737]  That's what it has come to.
[01:11:29.357 --> 01:11:30.939]  Have you written about this yet at Natural News?
[01:11:31.139 --> 01:11:31.900]  This is huge.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.102]  I haven't had time.
[01:11:33.182 --> 01:11:35.104]  I'm gonna do a feature article on that probably tomorrow.
[01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.479]  This is huge breaking news.
[01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:40.900]  That not only, as you point out, it's always worse than I can even say.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:45.742]  These laws, these bills that have passed in some areas, passing in others, unfortunately.
[01:11:45.762 --> 01:11:47.183]  We need to stop them, obviously.
[01:11:47.883 --> 01:11:50.825]  Let them kill the baby any means they want, including torture.
[01:11:51.525 --> 01:11:53.126]  And, but let's expand on that.
[01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:54.106]  That's what the governor threw in.
[01:11:54.326 --> 01:11:55.327]  We keep them comfortable.
[01:11:56.107 --> 01:11:56.688]  Aren't you nice?
[01:11:56.728 --> 01:11:57.368]  You're so sweet.
[01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:05.574]  That now Tim Cook, after teaching everybody that Alex Jones is banned, he's now moving on to sending you, what, an email?
[01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:07.535]  A letter saying, we want to approve your app?
[01:12:08.015 --> 01:12:08.115]  Yes.
[01:12:09.557 --> 01:12:09.757]  Wow.
[01:12:10.057 --> 01:12:11.878]  Yes, this is from the app development team.
[01:12:12.238 --> 01:12:21.762]  And what they do is they send us collections of articles that are not allowed, that they say they're going to ban our app if we continue to allow those articles.
[01:12:21.802 --> 01:12:24.083]  And those articles include, of course, abortion and Satanism.
[01:12:24.103 --> 01:12:28.985]  But also, by the way, one of the articles was an article that talked about Apple censoring Alex Jones.
[01:12:29.565 --> 01:12:33.387]  So they are going to censor us if we talk about censorship.
[01:12:34.131 --> 01:12:43.919]  And if we talk about the murder of babies and one of the other topics they won't allow us to talk about is illegal immigrants carrying infectious diseases into the United States.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.641]  So Apple
[01:12:47.152 --> 01:12:53.956]  The insanity of the censorship has reached a whole new level with Apple, Twitter, Google.
[01:12:54.016 --> 01:12:54.936]  Well it's all a plan.
[01:12:54.976 --> 01:12:55.596]  It's all a plan.
[01:12:55.857 --> 01:12:57.257]  And you need to contact Congress.
[01:12:57.317 --> 01:13:01.840]  I think Louie Gohmert needs to see this because this just shows the incredible racketeering that's going on.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.101]  They need to be subpoenaed.
[01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:06.043]  All of this needs to come out because this is the model.
[01:13:06.263 --> 01:13:12.807]  Since we mentioned it, here's President Trump saying we shouldn't kill already born babies and Nancy Pelosi will not stand.
[01:13:12.867 --> 01:13:13.167]  Here it is.
[01:13:14.338 --> 01:13:26.884]  There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
[01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:42.052]  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth.
[01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:50.895]  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.
[01:13:52.396 --> 01:14:00.602]  And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.
[01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:08.848]  To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation
[01:14:09.727 --> 01:14:17.381]  To prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
[01:14:19.995 --> 01:14:24.317]  And then you can zoom in on the TV ad on Pelosi's ugly face, looking so pissed.
[01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:25.717]  Now, let's look at another one of these harpies.
[01:14:26.137 --> 01:14:26.978]  Another one of these demons.
[01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:34.200]  They've been transferred from magical goddesses that, you know, take care of the babies and give us life, that God gave us, to now the executioners.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.902]  So here's Trump talking about stopping smugglers and things like this.
[01:14:37.962 --> 01:14:40.543]  Let's play Cortez and then Kamala Harris.
[01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:40.903]  Here it is.
[01:14:41.663 --> 01:14:49.086]  Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
[01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:59.943]  Elvin says that if I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've really done my job.
[01:15:01.172 --> 01:15:01.772]  Get paused.
[01:15:02.213 --> 01:15:02.873]  Mike's got to go.
[01:15:02.893 --> 01:15:06.775]  He's got to do five more minutes on the other side to finish up, but I got to finish with this and get his take.
[01:15:07.395 --> 01:15:18.501]  Imagine if Trump was the Speaker of the House and Pelosi was the President, and while he's talking about kidnapped women and children being saved, she's looking pissed, looking down at papers, and acting like she doesn't care.
[01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:22.903]  They would say, Trump acts disgracefully and sends out, you know,
[01:15:23.263 --> 01:15:31.001]  Signals that he doesn't care about women and stuff and he would be rightfully criticized But this pig this pig and and again, it's over and over again.
[01:15:31.041 --> 01:15:31.642]  They do this Mike
[01:15:32.935 --> 01:15:36.116]  Well, yeah, this is all part of the propaganda deception.
[01:15:36.136 --> 01:15:41.517]  And, you know, Trump just, I think he just won the 2020 election, by the way, with that statement.
[01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:45.617]  And we must defend life, because if we don't defend life, then what are we here for?
[01:15:45.997 --> 01:15:48.958]  If the Democrats are willing to kill their own children, they're willing to kill anyone.
[01:15:49.318 --> 01:15:50.238]  We've got to stop them.
[01:15:50.538 --> 01:15:53.759]  We can never let Democrats have power over us ever again.
[01:15:53.779 --> 01:15:54.039]  That's right.
[01:15:54.059 --> 01:15:54.999]  For the rest of our lives.
[01:15:55.239 --> 01:15:57.820]  Democrats have fully converted to Satanism.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.140]  They are a satanic army.
[01:16:05.746 --> 01:16:08.909]  When we go off to war.
[01:16:09.209 --> 01:16:11.010]  When we exercise our rights.
[01:16:13.973 --> 01:16:16.054]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:21.479]  When we mourn and pray.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.881]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[01:16:27.003 --> 01:16:28.985]  When our nation is threatened.
[01:16:30.846 --> 01:16:32.868]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:36.064]  To bring you the story.
[01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:39.847]  No matter the cost.
[01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:45.751]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[01:16:46.232 --> 01:16:47.973]  Because knowing empowers us.
[01:16:49.694 --> 01:16:51.396]  Knowing helps us decide.
[01:16:52.957 --> 01:16:55.178]  Knowing keeps us free.
[01:17:01.869 --> 01:17:14.179]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:26.349]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:17:27.654 --> 01:17:29.298]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.224]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:17:33.592 --> 01:17:37.414]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:17:37.934 --> 01:17:41.875]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:17:42.195 --> 01:17:44.236]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:17:44.476 --> 01:17:45.957]  This country is in a war!
[01:17:46.797 --> 01:17:56.841]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.

[01:20:06.947 --> 01:20:09.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:30.252]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:33.982 --> 01:20:55.445]  Now, notice the way a psychological operation of infiltration and demoralization works on a planetary scale, which we're witnessing, is you ambiently turn up the heat slowly until people adapt to being poisoned, being dumbed down, being demoralized, being enslaved, until suddenly, like, well, of course we kill babies after they're born.
[01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.358]  And of course we've got human-animal hybrids.
[01:20:59.279 --> 01:21:04.120]  And the Church of Satan is on ABC, CBS, NBC News warning of the dangers of the Vice President.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.981]  But Mike Adams can't have articles about the dangers of Satanism.
[01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:09.442]  Apple says you can't do that.
[01:21:09.462 --> 01:21:12.462]  Because their symbol is the apple with a bite out of it.
[01:21:13.343 --> 01:21:14.023]  The knowledge of evil.
[01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:17.804]  It's all in your face.
[01:21:18.684 --> 01:21:21.045]  So, he's leaving us in a moment, but I wanted to finish these clips.
[01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:21.325]  Here is...
[01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:27.055]  Cortez, when we hear about people being saved from smuggling, she doesn't stand up, she doesn't clap.
[01:21:28.276 --> 01:21:34.401]  She sits there like a demon-possessed creature and just stares at him with death eyes.
[01:21:34.482 --> 01:21:34.942]  Here it is.
[01:21:35.883 --> 01:21:43.370]  Today he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
[01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:45.491]  Elvin says
[01:21:46.647 --> 01:21:54.211]  That if I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've really done my job.
[01:21:55.652 --> 01:22:10.060]  Thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation.
[01:22:11.058 --> 01:22:19.167]  And more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
[01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:39.387]  All right, I can't watch any more of this.
[01:22:39.467 --> 01:22:41.108]  Let's go to Kamala Harris now.
[01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:47.714]  Kamala Harris actually shaking her head on a similar statement of the president.
[01:22:47.734 --> 01:22:48.094]  Here it is.
[01:22:48.695 --> 01:23:06.490]  Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.
[01:23:08.615 --> 01:23:11.196]  Look at the Democrats, they just look like demonic freaks.
[01:23:14.078 --> 01:23:18.520]  And I should add, they didn't stand up when he said stop human smugglers and traffickers and all this.
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:21.341]  I mean, Mexico is a hellhole on its northern border.
[01:23:22.341 --> 01:23:23.042]  These people are crazy.
[01:23:25.562 --> 01:23:29.908]  What a bunch of narcissistic, demonic people.
[01:23:29.928 --> 01:23:40.821]  So Mike, in closing, naturalnews.com, you've been censored for defending human life, standing up against the latest Bitcoin scams that corrupt billionaires are foisting on people.
[01:23:42.489 --> 01:23:49.231]  Why do you think we've seen the acceleration of the Democrats and the left, all over the world, really coming out in defense of everything evil?
[01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.772]  Are they uncloaking, or were they always this evil?
[01:23:52.992 --> 01:24:00.394]  Like you said yesterday, it's like an order has gone down, a transmission has gone out that has really activated them, and they're getting more vicious by the minute.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.201]  They've always been this evil, but it's been covert.
[01:24:04.281 --> 01:24:07.863]  And I think this is their reaction to the mass awakening that is happening.
[01:24:08.363 --> 01:24:12.585]  And that credit goes to people like you and InfoWars.
[01:24:12.605 --> 01:24:16.467]  The independent media all around has been waking people up, globally.
[01:24:17.174 --> 01:24:33.145]  And that awakening is accelerating, and this is why the reaction now is a panic decloaking by the pro-Satan, pro-demon left to accelerate their schedule of exterminating human life.
[01:24:33.185 --> 01:24:36.808]  And by the way, we say that,
[01:24:37.408 --> 01:24:38.610]  But it's real.
[01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:40.372]  It's not a metaphor.
[01:24:40.772 --> 01:24:45.118]  They are working to exterminate human life on our planet.
[01:24:45.238 --> 01:24:45.878]  You've written about it.
[01:24:45.918 --> 01:24:48.722]  The New York Times, they're all coming out saying, humans are bad.
[01:24:48.742 --> 01:24:49.743]  Let's get rid of all of them.
[01:24:50.083 --> 01:24:50.344]  Absolutely.
[01:24:50.364 --> 01:24:51.605]  The machine will all be dead.
[01:24:51.645 --> 01:24:52.626]  It's going to be so wonderful.
[01:24:53.287 --> 01:24:55.029]  We need a world government to kill everybody.
[01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.231]  That's the cult.
[01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:56.932]  It's a death cult.
[01:24:58.167 --> 01:24:59.247]  They openly talk about it.
[01:24:59.468 --> 01:25:02.629]  They openly talk about eliminating 90% of the human population.
[01:25:02.649 --> 01:25:03.549]  They say people are bad.
[01:25:03.889 --> 01:25:08.711]  They say carbon dioxide is bad, and that's, of course, a product of human respiration.
[01:25:09.131 --> 01:25:22.976]  And this so-called Green New Deal now being pushed by Ocasio-Cortez, if you think about what she is demanding, she's demanding not only an end to all commercial air travel in America, she's also demanding the mass slaughter of all cows,
[01:25:23.736 --> 01:25:29.058]  And eventually the mass slaughter of all humans, because those are the primary sources of carbon dioxide.
[01:25:29.078 --> 01:25:29.798]  It's a new dark age.
[01:25:29.978 --> 01:25:32.959]  That's what the global carbon tax system is, a new dark age.
[01:25:32.979 --> 01:25:33.159]  Yes.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:43.423]  Yes, and they're going to justify the extermination of human beings through this Green New Deal kind of logic, to say that in order to save the planet, they have to exterminate humans.
[01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:48.705]  But really, their goal is not to save the planet, not to save anybody.
[01:25:49.165 --> 01:25:54.186]  Their goal is utter destruction because they are demonically possessed destroyers of worlds.
[01:25:54.546 --> 01:25:57.647]  You know, this is much bigger than politics.
[01:25:57.667 --> 01:25:58.927]  This is much bigger than current events.
[01:25:58.967 --> 01:26:05.369]  This is, as I said yesterday on your show, this is a cosmic, biblical-scale war.
[01:26:05.409 --> 01:26:06.789]  This is the full offensive.
[01:26:07.029 --> 01:26:07.409]  Exactly.
[01:26:07.449 --> 01:26:13.651]  We've been facing, and Christ talked about it, everybody knows at the gut level, and again, the San Francisco elite all believe they're in contact with this.
[01:26:14.011 --> 01:26:16.872]  They believe this is an enlightenment to do all this.
[01:26:17.192 --> 01:26:18.172]  I mean, how insane is that?
[01:26:18.592 --> 01:26:27.138]  But literally, we've been probed before, there's been an emissary here, but this is the main offensive invasion about to happen.
[01:26:27.924 --> 01:26:28.184]  It is.
[01:26:28.344 --> 01:26:32.005]  And remember, the greatest trick of the devil is to convince you that he does not exist.
[01:26:32.505 --> 01:26:36.806]  And many of these people, you know, some people are wholly possessed by a demonic entity.
[01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:41.227]  Other people are simply influenced by demonic entities, and they're still partially human.
[01:26:41.567 --> 01:26:45.408]  But believe me, Alex, some of these people on the left are no longer human.
[01:26:45.448 --> 01:26:46.689]  This is critical to realize.
[01:26:47.129 --> 01:26:49.329]  You are not dealing... Why are their eyes all so big?
[01:26:49.449 --> 01:26:54.991]  All these Silicon people, even under heavy lights, it's like they're on hardcore drugs.
[01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:55.931]  Huge pupils.
[01:26:57.273 --> 01:26:58.414]  Well, yeah.
[01:26:58.814 --> 01:27:01.475]  Whatever divinity they might have been born with is long gone.
[01:27:01.495 --> 01:27:03.236]  They don't have a divine spirit anymore.
[01:27:03.497 --> 01:27:05.338]  And that's why they're capable of murdering babies.
[01:27:05.598 --> 01:27:09.700]  That's why they're capable of all the attacks and slander and lies and deception.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.922]  The Democrats have been overtaken by pure evil.
[01:27:13.242 --> 01:27:14.623]  And defeating the Democrats
[01:27:15.243 --> 01:27:17.224]  This is not a political victory.
[01:27:17.364 --> 01:27:20.764]  It is a cosmic, divine victory against pure evil.
[01:27:21.024 --> 01:27:23.245]  And we have to keep that in mind no matter what we do, Alex.
[01:27:23.765 --> 01:27:25.365]  I appreciate you having me on.
[01:27:25.385 --> 01:27:26.486]  I appreciate what you do.
[01:27:26.786 --> 01:27:28.126]  You know I'm fighting just as well.
[01:27:29.726 --> 01:27:30.847]  This fight has only just begun.
[01:27:30.927 --> 01:27:32.427]  It's going to get a lot worse for us, Alex.
[01:27:32.967 --> 01:27:35.728]  I hope we're both ready for it, because the attacks are coming.
[01:27:36.208 --> 01:27:38.008]  But in the end, God wins.
[01:27:38.309 --> 01:27:39.849]  God wins, and I'm on the side of God.
[01:27:39.869 --> 01:27:40.609]  That's not negotiable.
[01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.889]  That's it.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.603]  I don't care what threats they level against me.
[01:27:49.143 --> 01:27:50.344]  I am with God.
[01:27:50.524 --> 01:27:51.345]  I am with life.
[01:27:51.905 --> 01:27:53.767]  I am with truth, light.
[01:27:54.347 --> 01:27:57.930]  I am with freedom of speech, personal human liberty and the divine.
[01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.811]  End of story.
[01:27:59.211 --> 01:28:03.535]  And it would be much easier if people stopped believing Silicon Valley's lies and looked at
[01:28:04.415 --> 01:28:06.118]  Everywhere, they're openly telling people.
[01:28:06.138 --> 01:28:14.408]  I mean, Twitter, before they vanished, would send us messages and would have their executives call here and tell us, this is what you can say and what you can't say.
[01:28:14.448 --> 01:28:16.311]  It's literal social conditioning.
[01:28:16.571 --> 01:28:17.652]  Mike Adams, God bless you.
[01:28:17.672 --> 01:28:18.393]  Keep fighting hard.
[01:28:18.594 --> 01:28:20.736]  Everybody can find The Censored News at naturalnews.com.
[01:28:20.756 --> 01:28:21.037]  Thank you.
[01:28:21.852 --> 01:28:22.352]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:22.953 --> 01:28:28.457]  And again, folks, without you spreading the word for InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we're dead in the water.
[01:28:28.857 --> 01:28:29.578]  We're still fighting.
[01:28:29.598 --> 01:28:30.319]  We're moving forward.
[01:28:30.679 --> 01:28:34.021]  It's critical that we be on the air with the events that are about to unfold.
[01:28:35.002 --> 01:28:40.887]  The good, the bad, the ugly, but just massive evil being turned loose upon the planet.
[01:28:43.128 --> 01:28:43.849]  Now we come back.
[01:28:43.869 --> 01:28:46.031]  I want to get more into
[01:28:47.379 --> 01:28:48.220]  Now, mainstream news.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.921]  Splicing humans with mice.
[01:28:50.441 --> 01:28:51.402]  Been going on a long time.
[01:28:52.443 --> 01:28:54.324]  Next decade's news today.
[01:28:54.884 --> 01:28:55.305]  Straight ahead.

[01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:08.159]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[01:30:09.219 --> 01:30:14.221]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[01:30:15.141 --> 01:30:16.002]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:30:16.742 --> 01:30:17.222]  We stopped her.
[01:30:17.262 --> 01:30:18.142]  We got a nationalist in.
[01:30:19.423 --> 01:30:21.524]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:30:21.644 --> 01:30:22.544]  We are winning.
[01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:28.437]  Those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[01:30:28.897 --> 01:30:33.444]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[01:30:34.004 --> 01:30:35.106]  This is about who wants it most.
[01:30:36.539 --> 01:30:39.640]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors they've taken, everything.
[01:30:40.081 --> 01:30:41.581]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:30:42.222 --> 01:30:44.863]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[01:30:45.423 --> 01:30:46.043]  It's that simple.
[01:30:46.544 --> 01:30:47.624]  Thousands of great products.
[01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:54.047]  Whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWareShore.com.
[01:30:54.087 --> 01:31:02.191]  So please, go to InfoWareShore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:02.511]  Thank you.
[01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:10.376]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:23.885]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.

[01:33:07.033 --> 01:33:09.674]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.916 --> 01:33:20.878]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:21.218 --> 01:33:30.826]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.319 --> 01:33:42.860]  We're in St.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:48.844]  Augustine, Florida asking people which politician they think is in this photo and if they think it's a Republican or Democrat.
[01:33:49.245 --> 01:33:51.787]  Let's see how many people actually know it's a Democrat.
[01:33:58.773 --> 01:34:02.215]  Why would the city put assault weapons out for just anybody to get their hands on?
[01:34:02.235 --> 01:34:09.822]  I'm going to show you a photo and I want you to guess which politician is in the photo.
[01:34:13.004 --> 01:34:13.624]  Politician?
[01:34:15.765 --> 01:34:16.266]  Donald Trump.
[01:34:16.806 --> 01:34:19.207]  Who do you think would be most prone to dressing like this?
[01:34:19.227 --> 01:34:24.070]  Who do you think would be prone to dressing like this?
[01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:24.250]  Trump.
[01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:27.131]  Which politician do I think it is?
[01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:27.751]  Trump.
[01:34:40.916 --> 01:34:42.757]  Donald Trump?
[01:34:43.297 --> 01:34:43.637]  Trump.
[01:34:44.018 --> 01:34:45.258]  I'm gonna go with Donald Trump.
[01:34:45.739 --> 01:34:46.039]  Yeah.
[01:34:46.559 --> 01:34:47.840]  What makes you think it's Donald Trump?
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.181]  Because he's the fastest, raciest pig.
[01:34:50.261 --> 01:34:52.322]  Do you have any evidence for that?
[01:34:53.283 --> 01:34:53.623]  Plenty.
[01:34:54.283 --> 01:34:54.903]  Give me one.
[01:34:55.504 --> 01:34:59.566]  Well, I could... I'm on video.
[01:34:59.726 --> 01:35:04.588]  I'm not gonna grab her by the... You think that's racist?
[01:35:05.009 --> 01:35:06.750]  That's extremely sexist, yes.
[01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:07.930]  It's a good one.
[01:35:08.651 --> 01:35:08.951]  I don't know.
[01:35:10.273 --> 01:35:10.553]  Bush.
[01:35:12.977 --> 01:35:13.737]  George W. Bush.
[01:35:14.198 --> 01:35:15.219]  That's Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:35:16.661 --> 01:35:18.163]  And it's a very powerful video.
[01:35:18.183 --> 01:35:18.784]  Martin Luther King.
[01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:25.096]  Do you think Martin Luther King is in a KKK hood?
[01:35:25.316 --> 01:35:26.117]  Oh, the KKK?
[01:35:26.437 --> 01:35:30.780]  Um... So the full report is up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.162]  Liberals think it was Trump in Ralph Northam's racist photo.
[01:35:35.723 --> 01:35:43.987]  And then, you know, the first five minutes is her asking him questions, and then the next five minutes is her saying, by the way, that's a Democrat governor, Northam.
[01:35:45.468 --> 01:35:47.469]  And then they go, well, I don't care now, it was a long time ago.
[01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:51.352]  But since they thought it was Trump, without her even saying that,
[01:35:53.089 --> 01:35:53.569]  He was evil.
[01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:54.750]  So that's the double think.
[01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:55.830]  That's the brainwashing.
[01:35:56.491 --> 01:35:58.152]  That's how wrecked these brains are.
[01:35:58.192 --> 01:35:59.812]  How soft and stupid.
[01:36:00.073 --> 01:36:01.233]  And we're not cherry picking.
[01:36:02.354 --> 01:36:07.196]  You go to universities, you go to trendy areas, it's like these people are dead already.
[01:36:08.897 --> 01:36:10.458]  They are so stupid.
[01:36:11.839 --> 01:36:16.221]  What was weird is a few people that had foreign accents, they knew who it was and what was going on.
[01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:17.562]  It's just insane.
[01:36:18.842 --> 01:36:20.203]  It's so dangerous too, folks.
[01:36:21.618 --> 01:36:27.763]  You know, more prosecutors from the whole Mueller witch hunt have just left.
[01:36:27.823 --> 01:36:29.485]  They've just resigned from it.
[01:36:29.805 --> 01:36:30.406]  That's in the news.
[01:36:30.706 --> 01:36:33.869]  People are saying, oh, that signals the witch hunt is about to end.
[01:36:34.749 --> 01:36:35.810]  No, it doesn't signal that.
[01:36:37.612 --> 01:36:44.938]  It signals that that phase and that now Congress is going to start all these other fake investigations that aren't Russia-based, 84 of them.
[01:36:47.338 --> 01:36:48.579]  And Trump tweeted about it this morning.
[01:36:48.899 --> 01:37:00.926]  He said, so now, Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian collusion, that he's going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there's no reason to be doing so.
[01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:02.787]  Never happened before.
[01:37:03.267 --> 01:37:06.229]  Unlimited presidential harassment.
[01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:13.813]  Yeah, if Trump calls for a criminal investigation of Hillary, they go, he's meddling with the Justice Department involved in politics, when that's his power to do it.
[01:37:14.434 --> 01:37:16.095]  But when Congress does all these witch hunts,
[01:37:17.076 --> 01:37:20.058]  When they're the ones in bed with the Russians and stuff, it's just A-OK.
[01:37:20.219 --> 01:37:24.462]  So you just saw part of that clip with Caitlin Bennett that just goes to all this ignorance.
[01:37:24.482 --> 01:37:30.307]  She's joining us, along with Millie Weaver, another great Infowars.com reporter.
[01:37:30.687 --> 01:37:32.108]  They also have their own news organizations.
[01:37:32.128 --> 01:37:33.029]  They're just contributors here.
[01:37:33.049 --> 01:37:34.690]  We're very, very proud to have them working with us.
[01:37:34.710 --> 01:37:40.395]  I don't want to be too unduly impunished by the corporate board for their great work.
[01:37:40.435 --> 01:37:42.436]  But both of these ladies, in just the last
[01:37:43.843 --> 01:37:44.963]  We're good.
[01:38:06.969 --> 01:38:10.692]  Third trimester at birth, killing of her new baby that she has coming in about a month.
[01:38:11.392 --> 01:38:19.979]  Of course, she wasn't really planning to do it, but it's just, it's so criminal that even though I know her and her husband, they're great folks for many years, I know she's a great person illustrating it.
[01:38:20.359 --> 01:38:25.764]  I couldn't help but getting mad at her, even watching her make the call, even though I knew that she was doing it to illustrate it.
[01:38:25.824 --> 01:38:29.907]  That's how, this is a mother scheduling the dismemberment of her baby.
[01:38:31.502 --> 01:38:33.924]  And I mean, so I'm ranting here.
[01:38:34.565 --> 01:38:35.806]  Let's just start with that first.
[01:38:36.346 --> 01:38:37.467]  Ladies, good to have you here.
[01:38:38.147 --> 01:38:44.152]  What do you make of this governor of Virginia, the Democrats defending it, not standing up when Trump says it's wrong to do this?
[01:38:44.172 --> 01:38:47.075]  I mean, it really seems like they're showing us how evil they are.
[01:38:48.863 --> 01:38:49.464]  Oh definitely.
[01:38:49.484 --> 01:39:04.757]  I think that, you know, if in fact we are going to allow the Democrats to go forward and continue making late-term abortions legalized in all 50 states, then our society has reached a level of debauchery
[01:39:05.217 --> 01:39:05.397]  That's
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.201]  In their ninth month of pregnancy.
[01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:33.843]  Now, of course, I didn't follow through or even think about going to the clinic and doing like a James O'Keefe, Project Veritas style undercover report because I was too creeped out.
[01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:43.566]  I mean, it almost seemed like an abortion mill that you could wake up on a table and next thing you know, your baby's out of you because you signed some power of attorney form from a doctor or something.
[01:39:43.966 --> 01:39:45.947]  So that's why I didn't follow through with that.
[01:39:46.387 --> 01:39:47.327]  Great idea to do this.
[01:39:47.427 --> 01:39:48.488]  I'm not even criticizing you.
[01:39:48.548 --> 01:39:49.728]  I mean, I admire you.
[01:39:49.748 --> 01:40:00.891]  I'm saying, just at a cellular level, watching a mother even call a place to kill a baby after it's born, it was just so viscerally hard to watch.
[01:40:00.991 --> 01:40:03.232]  Imagine actually seeing it really happen.
[01:40:03.672 --> 01:40:04.912]  It's just incredible.
[01:40:05.473 --> 01:40:08.013]  I gotta tell you though, everybody should go watch the video.
[01:40:08.033 --> 01:40:10.734]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com and share it.
[01:40:11.054 --> 01:40:12.975]  How to schedule abortion at nine months.
[01:40:13.775 --> 01:40:16.260]  This is very, very powerful information.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.243]  Caitlin Bennett, what was it like for you to watch that video?
[01:40:19.898 --> 01:40:35.988]  Well, when they told me that they were doing it, I was super, I was kind of excited because I was like, finally, someone's going to, you know, basically bring to light how easy it is to do this because the law tries to say that it's only in extreme cases.
[01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:37.810]  And Millie proved that it wasn't.
[01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:41.952]  She was able to say, well, how do I go through those loopholes to say, what if I have depression?
[01:40:41.972 --> 01:40:44.354]  Or, you know, what if I'm sick?
[01:40:44.454 --> 01:40:45.955]  Or what if I just, you know, I'm
[01:40:52.137 --> 01:40:56.199]  I think it's so important that she did this video.
[01:40:56.299 --> 01:41:03.061]  It did make me sad because I was still, you know, just like you said, you know, she wasn't going through with it, but it still made you sad to watch it.
[01:41:03.421 --> 01:41:09.864]  But at the end of the day, she uncovered how it's not just these small rare cases.
[01:41:10.144 --> 01:41:10.264]  It's
[01:41:10.757 --> 01:41:15.927]  Anything, you know, just as long as the doctor says, okay, yeah, you aren't fit to be a parent.
[01:41:15.967 --> 01:41:19.834]  We can take this baby out and kill it, you know, right before birth.
[01:41:19.914 --> 01:41:22.479]  So I think what she did was great and it's so important.
[01:41:23.797 --> 01:41:29.581]  And the next, exactly, the next big shoot-a-drop is this degenerate demon governor of Virginia.
[01:41:29.901 --> 01:41:36.285]  He is a orthopedic, no, he's a surgeon that does non-orthopedics on muscles and bones.
[01:41:36.605 --> 01:41:43.949]  He is the, look at the type, I was reading his bio, he's the specific type of surgeon that does surgeries on organs on babies.
[01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:49.673]  And then I knew that because they keep catching these big hospitals selling the organs and keeping babies alive.
[01:41:49.933 --> 01:41:53.195]  And then sure enough, that's where this whole rabbit trail is leading us.
[01:41:54.462 --> 01:42:02.388]  Well, one of the false talking points that these pro-abortion advocates are making is that abortion is required to save women's lives.
[01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:11.916]  And if you actually listen to OBGYNs and former abortionists, what they'll tell you is that they've never actually had to perform an abortion to save a woman's life.
[01:42:12.236 --> 01:42:14.979]  Because abortion procedures take up to three days.
[01:42:15.079 --> 01:42:23.986]  It can take up to three days to dilate the cervix enough to evacuate the baby in a saline abortion, which is the only type of abortion that's illegal for late trimester.
[01:42:24.386 --> 01:42:35.396]  So, if actually a woman was in immediate need for help, what they do, and they have always done, is they deliver the baby via C-section, and if the baby's born early, it's taken off to NICU.
[01:42:35.496 --> 01:42:38.498]  At least the babies are given a fighting chance to survive.
[01:42:38.859 --> 01:42:46.085]  What Hillary Clinton and these feminists are pushing is intentionally killing a baby in advance, and then days later delivering it.
[01:42:46.405 --> 01:42:47.826]  That's not saving women's lives.
[01:42:48.106 --> 01:42:50.007]  That's killing babies.
[01:42:50.027 --> 01:42:52.288]  And they're getting caught everywhere selling the body parts.
[01:42:52.748 --> 01:42:57.171]  So now they're trying to pass laws to keep the babies alive after so that they can get around that.
[01:42:57.191 --> 01:43:01.253]  I mean this is beyond Charlie Manson and Sharon Tate.
[01:43:07.333 --> 01:43:08.634]  Here's the thing, I'm not giving up.
[01:43:09.355 --> 01:43:13.978]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side, but it takes money to wage this war.
[01:43:14.378 --> 01:43:18.081]  You're spreading the word, you're praying for us, and you're financially supporting us.
[01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:21.443]  It's key, it's essential, it's absolute like oxygen.
[01:43:21.743 --> 01:43:24.605]  We have to have it, and we've got great products you already need.
[01:43:24.625 --> 01:43:25.686]  I mean, take fish oil.
[01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:27.828]  What it does for your heart, your brain, energy.
[01:43:27.908 --> 01:43:29.509]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[01:43:29.649 --> 01:43:35.253]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night, and I gotta work till 3am on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I pop five fish oils.
[01:43:35.553 --> 01:43:37.054]  Nobody calls fish oil nootropic.
[01:43:37.614 --> 01:43:38.774]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[01:43:38.914 --> 01:43:41.175]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[01:43:41.355 --> 01:43:42.736]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[01:43:43.676 --> 01:43:44.937]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[01:43:45.177 --> 01:43:49.859]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m., with my coffee, I bang back three big ol' fat, juicy fish oils.
[01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:55.401]  And so, our ultimate krill oil is even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:58.743]  It gives you the burps, I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it.
[01:43:58.803 --> 01:44:00.923]  The ultimate krill oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[01:44:01.064 --> 01:44:02.204]  I mean, it's the next level.
[01:44:02.424 --> 01:44:03.245]  Ultimate fish oil.
[01:44:03.425 --> 01:44:04.605]  All crafted out of fjords.
[01:44:04.725 --> 01:44:05.186]  Amazing.
[01:44:05.286 --> 01:44:06.226]  Doesn't give you the burpees.
[01:44:06.366 --> 01:44:07.547]  Neither does Honor Roll.
[01:44:07.687 --> 01:44:08.548]  It's amazing for your kids.
[01:44:08.588 --> 01:44:09.248]  Small caplets.
[01:44:09.268 --> 01:44:10.389]  But I tend to like Honor Roll.
[01:44:10.489 --> 01:44:11.749]  Okay, I'm a fish oil addict.
[01:44:11.890 --> 01:44:12.290]  I'm not gonna lie.
[01:44:12.450 --> 01:44:13.270]  I got all the stuff.
[01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:14.691]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[01:44:15.312 --> 01:44:16.532]  Brainforce is a thing of the past.
[01:44:16.692 --> 01:44:18.313]  And for different people, different things.
[01:44:19.174 --> 01:44:22.075]  I'm just telling you, fish oil is numero uno.
[01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:25.878]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:44:33.055 --> 01:44:35.517]  Body that uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[01:44:35.577 --> 01:44:38.179]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[01:44:38.559 --> 01:44:43.883]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:52.250]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:57.534]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[01:44:58.075 --> 01:44:59.816]  Right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:59.856 --> 01:45:01.137]  Please support this network.
[01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:08.702]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.343]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[01:45:10.383 --> 01:45:11.204]  This is my favorite.
[01:45:11.224 --> 01:45:13.786]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[01:45:14.166 --> 01:45:15.067]  I mean, really, it's true.
[01:45:15.127 --> 01:45:18.149]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[01:45:18.309 --> 01:45:20.271]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[01:45:20.371 --> 01:45:23.313]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[01:45:23.414 --> 01:45:26.456]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before.
[01:45:26.496 --> 01:45:30.519]  With these two here, I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working.
[01:45:30.539 --> 01:45:33.241]  At the end of doing a broadcast, I have the energy to go to a gym.
[01:45:33.341 --> 01:45:33.902]  And frankly,
[01:45:34.162 --> 01:45:36.803]  I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[01:45:36.843 --> 01:45:39.885]  It's heartbreaking that Supermail Vitality is about to go away.
[01:45:39.925 --> 01:45:43.447]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[01:45:43.467 --> 01:45:44.568]  But that's what it's all about.
[01:45:44.608 --> 01:45:45.808]  This is the real deal.
[01:45:45.848 --> 01:45:50.551]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day and all of a sudden it's like, whoa, I'm a man again.
[01:45:50.571 --> 01:45:55.974]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[01:45:56.034 --> 01:45:56.614]  It's back.
[01:45:57.034 --> 01:45:59.655]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[01:45:59.795 --> 01:46:04.597]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[01:46:04.717 --> 01:46:07.038]  Everybody loves everything in the InfoWars store.
[01:46:07.178 --> 01:46:08.798]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[01:46:08.898 --> 01:46:09.979]  You're supporting the show.
[01:46:10.019 --> 01:46:11.279]  You're supporting the InfoWars.
[01:46:11.399 --> 01:46:14.520]  And really, as conservatives, who are you going to give your money to?
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:19.922]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises on Roku?
[01:46:20.042 --> 01:46:22.363]  Or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[01:46:22.623 --> 01:46:23.884]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:29.707]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes, super male vitality versus female vitality is an aging process.
[01:46:29.767 --> 01:46:30.428]  It's cold-pressed.
[01:46:30.528 --> 01:46:35.991]  It takes three to four times more of the herbs to do it, and it's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[01:46:36.071 --> 01:46:41.834]  When I first heard about it, like, six, seven years ago that it was being developed, and I actually tried it, I was like, okay, this actually works.
[01:46:42.034 --> 01:46:46.137]  But I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2 and with the Super Metal Vitality.
[01:46:46.237 --> 01:46:48.278]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore.
[01:46:48.378 --> 01:46:54.542]  And if I wasn't taking it and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[01:46:54.803 --> 01:46:59.626]  So get your Super Metal Vitality, the final run, unless me squeezing them makes me win out on the prize.
[01:46:59.726 --> 01:47:01.007]  So get it today while you still can.
[01:47:06.951 --> 01:47:09.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.233 --> 01:47:30.275]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:47:30.936 --> 01:47:33.218]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:33.878 --> 01:47:36.020]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.182]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:47:39.723 --> 01:47:42.164]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:47:42.224 --> 01:47:44.906]  Kelly Weaver and Kenton Bennett, two amazing reporters.
[01:47:48.069 --> 01:47:54.733]  Are joining us right now live on this Thursday, February 7th, 2019 transmission.
[01:47:54.853 --> 01:47:56.053]  We'll go right back to them.
[01:47:56.374 --> 01:48:00.476]  But I want to tell TV viewers, viewer discretion is advised.
[01:48:00.636 --> 01:48:13.884]  I told you this back at the start of the first hour that I was going to air footage of post-birth abortions.
[01:48:16.141 --> 01:48:21.564]  Now, we've obtained footage of four post-birth abortions.
[01:48:22.405 --> 01:48:34.912]  These are human beings being brutally murdered in front of broad daylight, in front of medical personnel, in front of everybody.
[01:48:35.712 --> 01:48:40.275]  And we're going to air this footage right now, ladies and gentlemen, a partial birth abortion.
[01:48:40.555 --> 01:48:42.897]  Like the president said, how are you doing this?
[01:48:44.077 --> 01:48:45.098]  Radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[01:48:46.451 --> 01:48:50.212]  How are you doing this when the baby's already born?
[01:48:50.372 --> 01:48:54.354]  Because remember, post-birth abortion is the same thing as killing a granny.
[01:48:54.874 --> 01:48:56.474]  Remember Newsweek, the case for killing granny?
[01:48:57.015 --> 01:48:58.075]  And what Bill Gates is pushing.
[01:48:58.375 --> 01:49:02.316]  The idea that killing off and not taking care of each other makes us a better society.
[01:49:02.336 --> 01:49:03.777]  No, it makes us a worse society.
[01:49:05.197 --> 01:49:06.778]  So for TV viewers, let's go ahead and roll.
[01:49:08.201 --> 01:49:12.483]  A footage from 1963, a post-birth abortion in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas.
[01:49:12.503 --> 01:49:13.604]  Go ahead and roll it, please.
[01:49:14.044 --> 01:49:15.105]  This is a subrooter film.
[01:49:15.785 --> 01:49:28.652]  President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, before he was going to come to Austin, and boom, shot in the neck, and then shot in the front of the head, and the whole back and side of the head blows out.
[01:49:29.092 --> 01:49:32.274]  Now PBS can show that, we'll have complaints, it's just we're Alex Jones, we shouldn't show it.
[01:49:32.574 --> 01:49:34.475]  And by the way, I'm not being sarcastic, this is a post-
[01:49:35.987 --> 01:49:36.727]  Birth abortion.
[01:49:36.988 --> 01:49:38.128]  How old was Kennedy when he got killed?
[01:49:39.309 --> 01:49:41.130]  And the deep state wanted him dead, so they aborted him.
[01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:42.630]  Right there.
[01:49:43.111 --> 01:49:43.851]  Abort means kill.
[01:49:44.391 --> 01:49:45.652]  Let me show you that from Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:46.993 --> 01:49:50.955]  This is somebody else being post-birth abortioned.
[01:49:51.935 --> 01:49:52.175]  Okay?
[01:49:53.456 --> 01:49:57.858]  And so they, again, take their sword and cut your head off right there, folks.
[01:49:58.418 --> 01:50:01.220]  This is a woman that didn't do what her husband said.
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.601]  And so, here you go.
[01:50:03.681 --> 01:50:05.202]  Here goes the post-birth abortion.
[01:50:06.055 --> 01:50:07.055]  Because that's what it is.
[01:50:07.135 --> 01:50:08.856]  You're killing someone outside the womb.
[01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:12.517]  And if you're offended by this, you know, I'm sorry.
[01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:15.858]  The stuff they show kids shows is ten times worse.
[01:50:16.138 --> 01:50:16.959]  This is real, though.
[01:50:16.979 --> 01:50:18.519]  And this is what's happening.
[01:50:19.019 --> 01:50:20.740]  And then, of course, we can show you a sinner.
[01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:24.531]  A famous race car driver dying in a world champion race.
[01:50:25.432 --> 01:50:30.795]  And that's post-birth abortion, except it wasn't conscious he chose to get in the arena.
[01:50:31.415 --> 01:50:41.340]  So going back to you ladies there, if we actually tried to show an abortion, and you can get footage of partial birth abortions, I've watched it only a few times, and I can't look at it, we're not going to show that here.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:47.723]  Because we really care about babies, and we can see Kennedy killed, or see a poor woman get her head chopped off, and it's terrible, and I borderline don't do it.
[01:50:48.243 --> 01:50:53.788]  Just like it upsets me to see Millie calling to schedule the execution of her new baby that's coming, even though she wasn't planning it.
[01:50:53.808 --> 01:50:54.588]  She's doing it to stop it.
[01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:55.529]  It's visceral.
[01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:56.590]  I get why people are upset.
[01:50:56.950 --> 01:51:01.054]  But you should be upset, folks, so that we can protect children and not let this happen.
[01:51:01.594 --> 01:51:03.355]  Millie, Kaitlin, you want to comment on that?
[01:51:03.375 --> 01:51:14.965]  I mean, what's your view of my point from this angle of this is post-birth abortion.
[01:51:16.127 --> 01:51:24.294]  Yeah, so I really thought that you were going to show like a post-birth abortion and then I saw the video and I was like, one, that's clever because it's true.
[01:51:24.314 --> 01:51:26.515]  Those are literally the same things.
[01:51:27.496 --> 01:51:37.985]  I think, you know, the only thing I've been thinking about is the State of the Union, how none of the women in white, none of the Democrats stood and clapped when President Trump said he wants them to
[01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:38.705]  I think?
[01:52:09.326 --> 01:52:11.409]  Well, look, they're not the party of science, they claim they are.
[01:52:11.429 --> 01:52:15.494]  They're the party of tyranny, and the party of evil, and they want to dehumanize life.
[01:52:16.115 --> 01:52:21.162]  They want us to think humans are bad, and that humans are the problem, so we don't value ourselves, and don't stand up for ourselves.
[01:52:21.783 --> 01:52:24.927]  Millie Weaver, why do you think the Democrats are coming out in the open like this?
[01:52:26.411 --> 01:52:36.134]  Well, I wanted to answer the first part, the first question you asked, Caitlin, there about, you know, what I thought about the afterbirth abortions.
[01:52:36.254 --> 01:52:46.596]  Caitlin recently posted a video on Twitter that went mega viral where, you know, a father was out with his daughter at a woman's march promoting abortion and trying to deny that it was murder.
[01:52:47.037 --> 01:52:52.058]  Then he turns around and says to Caitlin that he's going to afterbirth abortion her.
[01:52:52.839 --> 01:52:55.341]  You know, he's gonna late-term abortion her.
[01:52:55.541 --> 01:52:58.724]  And so he acknowledges then that essentially it's killing.
[01:52:59.164 --> 01:53:00.906]  You're talking about killing a person.
[01:53:00.926 --> 01:53:09.813]  And, you know, that's one of the things that Hillary Clinton was trying to get out from underneath during her debate with Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.
[01:53:10.233 --> 01:53:14.337]  She was trying to say, oh, well, this is necessary for women's health.
[01:53:14.697 --> 01:53:20.244]  And Trump was saying, well, she's actually saying that babies are going to be drugged from the womb moments before birth.
[01:53:20.865 --> 01:53:24.470]  And that's exactly what the Democrats are now pushing for.
[01:53:24.850 --> 01:53:29.897]  And they're using the talking point that this is to save women's health, that it's medically necessary.
[01:53:30.297 --> 01:53:35.640]  When it's not medically necessary to kill babies, you'll ride up until their due date.
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:38.402]  You can just deliver them and allow them to live.
[01:53:38.782 --> 01:53:43.004]  But then again, this isn't about women's bodies, women's choices.
[01:53:43.024 --> 01:53:46.626]  We're talking about whether or not they're going to allow for the killing of babies.
[01:53:46.947 --> 01:53:56.252]  Because I don't think most conservatives are actually objecting to babies being delivered prematurely if the mother is in a serious medical emergency.
[01:53:56.272 --> 01:53:57.212]  Sure, that's all a giant red herring.
[01:53:57.272 --> 01:53:57.873]  Everything's a red herring.
[01:53:57.893 --> 01:53:59.754]  Look, they want to keep the babies alive.
[01:54:00.234 --> 01:54:01.235]  So they can get the organs.
[01:54:01.455 --> 01:54:03.316]  That's why they're trying to pass these laws as a cover.
[01:54:03.917 --> 01:54:08.640]  But since you mention it, that video I think you have like 18 million views just on Twitter alone, Facebook.
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:12.122]  I mean, so when I say you guys have gotten like 30 million views last few weeks, it's way more than that.
[01:54:12.542 --> 01:54:21.688]  Which again shows people's hunger and that's one reason Caitlyn Bennett and others, I've noticed people are attacking you and the Ben Shapiros and people because they think they own conservatism.
[01:54:22.268 --> 01:54:23.589]  They're gods, you have to understand.
[01:54:23.929 --> 01:54:30.634]  And when they see you, without you being pushed by the Google algorithm, getting more views than them, that's very upsetting to Ben Shapiro and other people.
[01:54:30.694 --> 01:54:38.639]  And then other people join in on making fun of you, because you're right out of college, and also working with Millie, doing a great job, and they're just jealous of you.
[01:54:38.719 --> 01:54:40.421]  So, it's pathetic.
[01:54:41.201 --> 01:54:42.323]  And it's why I hate these people.
[01:54:42.604 --> 01:54:49.036]  You know, Ben Shapiro ought to feel good that there are a lot of smart, young, attractive women and others out there taking action.
[01:54:49.296 --> 01:54:52.402]  But again, these people are monopoly men, and it's why I hate their guts.
[01:54:52.963 --> 01:54:53.704]  You want to comment on that?
[01:54:54.767 --> 01:55:12.056]  Yeah, so I've always said that the mainstream conservative people that I actually used to look up to, I used to look up to Ben Shapiro, I used to look up to the conservative millennial, Matt Walsh, I used to look up to all of these people and now I see that they're mad because I didn't wait my turn.
[01:55:12.256 --> 01:55:21.740]  I didn't go through CRTV, I didn't go through The Blaze, I didn't go through all of these GOP, you know, Rhino websites or something like that.
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:22.581]  I didn't wait my turn.
[01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:24.786]  I went out there, I was me.
[01:55:25.107 --> 01:55:26.531]  I left Turning Point USA.
[01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:31.704]  Yeah, you smashed through the glass ceiling and your average video gets a million views and that's more than them and they're pissed!
[01:55:33.103 --> 01:55:39.386]  Yeah, I mean, I was with Turning Point USA at one point, and then I realized that that wasn't the brand of conservatism for me.
[01:55:39.446 --> 01:55:44.409]  I didn't like the run-of-the-mill GOP stances that they took, so I left.
[01:55:44.749 --> 01:55:49.511]  I did my own thing, and I am so proud of myself for what I've been able to accomplish.
[01:55:49.672 --> 01:55:57.976]  And if that bothers the run-of-the-mill conservatives and the rhino GOP establishment, then I'm doing my job.
[01:55:58.536 --> 01:56:06.143]  Well also, Ben Shapiro and a few others put on this affected, super intellectual thing with their talking points to look really smart to a libtard.
[01:56:06.203 --> 01:56:07.344]  That's like, that's not hard.
[01:56:07.364 --> 01:56:08.605]  These people can't even talk.
[01:56:09.145 --> 01:56:11.307]  And then you're a young woman with a nice southern voice.
[01:56:11.667 --> 01:56:12.368]  They make fun of you.
[01:56:12.388 --> 01:56:13.389]  You know, they act like you're stupid.
[01:56:13.849 --> 01:56:17.071]  And, oh, so there's the conservative guys, you know, these little dumb women.
[01:56:17.311 --> 01:56:19.173]  Women, you just sit over... They're all the same.
[01:56:19.453 --> 01:56:23.795]  And it makes me sick how it's the Democrats that tell women, we own you.
[01:56:24.076 --> 01:56:26.017]  It's the fake conservative movement that tells women, we own you.
[01:56:26.417 --> 01:56:28.338]  And, no, they don't own anybody.
[01:56:28.638 --> 01:56:29.339]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:56:29.379 --> 01:56:30.159]  I've got three daughters.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:34.342]  I want them to absolutely be as successful as any man or more successful.
[01:56:34.722 --> 01:56:35.943]  That's what real conservatives want.
[01:56:36.263 --> 01:56:37.744]  It's what the West has done.
[01:56:38.124 --> 01:56:40.006]  We're conserving our idea of really
[01:56:40.686 --> 01:56:45.349]  Turning loose the power of women to make our lives better, their lives better, and to be strong mothers.
[01:56:45.389 --> 01:56:47.030]  We want women that know how to use guns.
[01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:48.151]  Women that know how to fight.
[01:56:48.391 --> 01:56:49.211]  Women that know how to cook.
[01:56:49.411 --> 01:56:50.912]  Women that know how to kill.
[01:56:50.932 --> 01:56:52.633]  We want women that know how to do everything.
[01:56:52.893 --> 01:56:53.514]  That's what we want.
[01:56:53.994 --> 01:56:56.816]  But it's only real conservatives and Christians that want that.
[01:56:57.867 --> 01:57:02.553]  And real conservative women actually do want to advocate for women's rights.
[01:57:02.934 --> 01:57:10.865]  And that's why Caitlyn has said so many times about how important it is for women to carry, to be able to have a gun, to protect herself.
[01:57:11.085 --> 01:57:13.768]  And that's what really pisses them off about her, exactly.
[01:57:14.622 --> 01:57:15.983]  Exactly, it's sick.
[01:57:17.384 --> 01:57:26.691]  They want to capitalize women's rights, these feminist movements, when in reality most of what feminists are pushing actually hurts women in the long term.
[01:57:27.032 --> 01:57:40.582]  If you want to talk about abortion, well what's happening with abortion in our society right now is it's an underlying symptom of the destruction of the male and female dynamic and it's simply a symptom of
[01:57:41.062 --> 01:57:45.209]  The debauchery that our society has happened after the women's sexual liberation.
[01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:48.194]  Absolutely, which was nothing but a thing to destroy the family.
[01:57:49.135 --> 01:57:51.099]  And again, it was scientifically designed to do so.
[01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:51.640]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:53.237 --> 01:58:00.583]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[01:58:01.203 --> 01:58:07.028]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[01:58:07.088 --> 01:58:11.392]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[01:58:11.972 --> 01:58:27.599]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we private label their product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:35.063]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[01:58:35.683 --> 01:58:37.303]  But the announcement here today is this.
[01:58:38.004 --> 01:58:41.484]  We've been selling a lot of the Wombshell and a lot of the ImmuneGuard.
[01:58:41.925 --> 01:58:44.205]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[01:58:44.965 --> 01:58:55.688]  But then I noticed, without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[01:58:56.388 --> 01:59:11.295]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis, we're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at empholerstlife.com and empholerstore.com.
[01:59:11.775 --> 01:59:12.676]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:13.036 --> 01:59:16.958]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[01:59:17.258 --> 01:59:22.881]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[01:59:23.681 --> 01:59:27.023]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[01:59:27.283 --> 01:59:31.965]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:39.728]  That when there's a crisis, and people really need something and want it, I'm gonna sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[01:59:40.088 --> 01:59:50.613]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off, as a combo, or 40% off, individually, while supplies last, at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.754 --> 01:59:59.835]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:00:00.355 --> 02:00:01.696]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.398 --> 02:00:11.378]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:11.698 --> 02:00:13.519]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:14.199 --> 02:00:15.679]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:24.942]  You know, the number one thing I think you should teach your daughters or your sons, but Linda particularly, is how to be confident.
[02:00:26.425 --> 02:00:31.709]  And how to not let other people manipulate their emotions or control them, and how to kill.
[02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:38.374]  And in good cultures, women are brought right along with the men and taught how to kill people.
[02:00:38.674 --> 02:00:46.500]  And I'm not somebody looking to kill anybody, but that's how women particularly get preyed on by predators, is because they don't have the killer instinct honed.
[02:00:47.121 --> 02:00:48.622]  And most men have had this removed as well.
[02:00:49.082 --> 02:00:50.723]  The killer instinct doesn't mean you're a killer.
[02:00:51.144 --> 02:00:53.646]  It means you're ready to kill if you have to, to protect yourself.
[02:00:54.346 --> 02:01:02.672]  And that's why the establishment is especially the leftists are so afraid of empowered women like Millie Weaver and of course like Caitlin Bennett.
[02:01:02.692 --> 02:01:04.413]  So in closing, ladies, we salute you.
[02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:06.795]  We appreciate you and all the work you're doing.
[02:01:07.755 --> 02:01:09.917]  And it's just so exciting to follow all that.
[02:01:09.957 --> 02:01:11.758]  Tell people how they follow your independent work.
[02:01:12.058 --> 02:01:15.981]  You also contribute some for InfoWars and tell us also.
[02:01:17.142 --> 02:01:24.972]  Let's set up for us after that, because there's a longer video of what happened with his so-called dad at the Women's March right by the Pro-Life March.
[02:01:24.992 --> 02:01:25.873]  He's pissed at people.
[02:01:26.214 --> 02:01:27.395]  You say, hey, what about your kid?
[02:01:27.415 --> 02:01:28.757]  You don't want them to die after they're born.
[02:01:29.077 --> 02:01:30.139]  And he says, I'll kill you.
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:33.884]  So tell us how folks follow you, but then also, Kaitlin, what happened there?
[02:01:35.541 --> 02:01:38.165]  Um, yeah, so you can follow me on Twitter, KateMarieOX.
[02:01:38.405 --> 02:01:41.609]  Instagram is, uh, just type in Caitlin Bennett basically anywhere.
[02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:43.171]  Uh, you can follow me there.
[02:01:43.271 --> 02:01:48.738]  And then, obviously, keep visiting InfoWars.com because all of my content gets posted there as well.
[02:01:49.279 --> 02:01:53.184]  Um, and talking about the rest of that video, there's actually a whole longer video where
[02:01:53.884 --> 02:02:09.376]  Uh, that man that said that he would late-term abort me would, uh, he was yelling at my friend, showing his daughter, that girl right there in the red MAGA hat, he was pointing to her and telling his daughter, don't end up like her, she's an idiot, don't end up like these women, they're, they're terrible people.
[02:02:09.396 --> 02:02:15.381]  Uh, and right in front of his daughter, he said that he would murder me for justice, for telling his daughter the truth.
[02:02:16.021 --> 02:02:22.086]  Uh, so, these people know that abortion is murder, they know exactly what it is, they just don't want to admit it.
[02:02:23.137 --> 02:02:24.258]  Because you had the live stream.
[02:02:24.278 --> 02:02:28.822]  I went and watched it in the course of, you know, the 32nd one's the one that got 20-something million views or whatever it is now.
[02:02:29.222 --> 02:02:29.943]  Last time I checked.
[02:02:31.324 --> 02:02:33.165]  But in full context, he was already in your face.
[02:02:33.426 --> 02:02:34.146]  Now here's the video.
[02:02:35.227 --> 02:02:37.909]  Do you know what the number one cause of death in the United States is?
[02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:39.571]  It's abortion.
[02:02:39.691 --> 02:02:42.153]  No, actually I... It's abortion.
[02:02:42.433 --> 02:02:43.875]  Shay, you have a right to one.
[02:02:45.516 --> 02:02:46.497]  Abortion is murder.
[02:02:47.894 --> 02:02:48.675]  Stay away from her.
[02:02:48.855 --> 02:02:50.156]  Your daddy would have killed you.
[02:02:50.397 --> 02:02:51.458]  What will you do to me?
[02:02:51.478 --> 02:02:53.200]  I'll abort you after.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:55.362]  You'll abort me after term?
[02:02:55.462 --> 02:02:57.064]  Yeah, it's like late term abortion.
[02:02:57.304 --> 02:02:57.505]  You.
[02:02:58.566 --> 02:03:00.588]  At a women's march, you just said you would murder me.
[02:03:01.489 --> 02:03:03.912]  I'm not against justice.
[02:03:05.410 --> 02:03:10.957]  That guy's a total cuck, wannabe tough guy, who then shoots his mouth off at people.
[02:03:10.997 --> 02:03:12.699]  What a punk.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:14.302]  What a piece of crap, Millie.
[02:03:14.622 --> 02:03:15.503]  What a piece of crap.
[02:03:17.325 --> 02:03:18.287]  Where do you see this going?
[02:03:19.349 --> 02:03:24.352]  Well, I think that it's obvious that the Democrats know that abortion is murder.
[02:03:24.392 --> 02:03:27.354]  They just want to deny it because it doesn't fit their political agenda.
[02:03:27.674 --> 02:03:42.882]  But they'll use children when it comes to pushing their agenda against Trump and saying, oh, the children are being put in cages on the border, which was all false, or saying, oh, we need to ban guns because of the children at schools, which we know that if there were guns in schools, the children would be safer.
[02:03:43.203 --> 02:03:46.885]  So they're more than capable of using children for their political agenda.
[02:03:46.925 --> 02:03:47.485]  Don't you love him?
[02:03:47.645 --> 02:03:51.388]  He's telling his five-year-old daughter, like, you can get one too, baby.
[02:03:51.688 --> 02:03:53.130]  You can kill your babies.
[02:03:53.410 --> 02:03:54.351]  What a frickin' man.
[02:03:54.591 --> 02:03:55.352]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:03:55.972 --> 02:03:59.935]  I mean, I don't, I'm not calling for violence, but I just, that's why I can't go out in public a lot.
[02:03:59.956 --> 02:04:01.297]  That guy thinks he's so tough, man.
[02:04:01.417 --> 02:04:01.917]  Oh my God.
[02:04:02.498 --> 02:04:07.282]  I'll be honest, at an instinctive level, I'm just like, I mean, it was just like, that guy is a piece of garbage.
[02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:21.418]  Well, I want to say that you can also find more of Caitlin's reports on her YouTube channel, Liberty Hangout, which I know that she said has recently generated, I think, around 30,000 plus new subscribers just in this month alone.
[02:04:21.718 --> 02:04:22.979]  So you can find her reports there.
[02:04:22.999 --> 02:04:26.281]  You can also find my reports on Millennial Millie on YouTube.
[02:04:27.145 --> 02:04:28.626]  Well, you ladies are awesome.
[02:04:28.666 --> 02:04:29.767]  You're an example to everybody.
[02:04:29.787 --> 02:04:34.971]  And I've told my daughters, if they want to be reporters once they're, you know, 17, 18, they can hopefully follow in your footsteps.
[02:04:35.291 --> 02:04:37.712]  Because by then, I think I've been too long in the wars.
[02:04:38.213 --> 02:04:39.854]  But we really appreciate you both.
[02:04:39.894 --> 02:04:40.414]  You're awesome.
[02:04:40.795 --> 02:04:45.418]  And I know why people are so jealous of both of you and make fun of you and attack you on the left and right.
[02:04:45.598 --> 02:04:47.900]  And it's shameful.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:52.643]  But it's why I don't like Ben Shapiro and a few other people that I know have been joining in on it.
[02:04:52.703 --> 02:04:53.183]  And it's just...
[02:04:54.524 --> 02:04:57.805]  It's not what's going to win the planet back from the globalists, and it's pretty sad.
[02:04:58.245 --> 02:04:58.785]  We salute you.
[02:04:58.805 --> 02:04:59.566]  God bless, ladies.
[02:05:00.186 --> 02:05:00.726]  Thank you.

[02:06:36.351 --> 02:06:40.193]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:44.655]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:53.759 --> 02:06:55.500]  Elizabeth Johnson's the activist mommy.
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:56.681]  We're going to her in just a moment.
[02:06:57.438 --> 02:07:01.161]  To get her take just on the full-out demonic attack.
[02:07:01.822 --> 02:07:04.464]  That again, I've got all these hundreds of huge breaking stories.
[02:07:04.484 --> 02:07:08.567]  I'm not obsessing on this for two days because of lack of news.
[02:07:09.408 --> 02:07:22.518]  The archetypal iconography, the symbolism of, we've saved all these women from sex slavery and children and made thousands of arrests and convictions.
[02:07:23.399 --> 02:07:25.501]  And the Democrats shaking their heads, angry.
[02:07:26.667 --> 02:07:27.487]  Pelosi won't stand up.
[02:07:28.047 --> 02:07:29.868]  It's wrong to kill babies after they're born.
[02:07:30.168 --> 02:07:31.569]  Pelosi shakes her head, won't stand up.
[02:07:32.129 --> 02:07:36.730]  I mean, if this isn't serial killers when they're getting convicted say, please, I'm sorry.
[02:07:38.591 --> 02:07:40.291]  They're beyond evil.
[02:07:40.591 --> 02:07:42.852]  And I want to get her take on this and the waterfront.
[02:07:42.872 --> 02:07:44.212]  But I did not plug last hour.
[02:07:44.252 --> 02:07:50.294]  And I've told people I'm my own worst enemy because the way we fund ourselves is not the ads you run radio stations.
[02:07:50.314 --> 02:07:51.695]  That's for local stations, the network.
[02:07:51.835 --> 02:07:55.036]  I fund ourselves with books, T-shirt sales.
[02:07:56.577 --> 02:08:03.987]  Supplements, water filtration, air filtration, and everything we sell needs to be the best because I want you to really get a good response.
[02:08:04.007 --> 02:08:05.629]  So I go out and say, what's the highest rated?
[02:08:05.969 --> 02:08:09.214]  What's the best system out there for the lowest price for air filtration?
[02:08:09.534 --> 02:08:10.936]  And that's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:08:12.952 --> 02:08:19.440]  Now, everything's getting cheaper because of menstruation and things, but when I first started selling it three years ago, the leading competitor was $800, it was $250.
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:21.402]  It's $200 now.
[02:08:22.002 --> 02:08:23.825]  And it's four-stage ion filter.
[02:08:24.185 --> 02:08:24.626]  Incredible.
[02:08:25.426 --> 02:08:27.469]  And it really helps places like Texas with all these allergies.
[02:08:27.489 --> 02:08:31.594]  As soon as I go outside, it's like, ugh, but inside I've got the Alexa Pure Breeze right there.
[02:08:31.654 --> 02:08:32.134]  It's awesome.
[02:08:33.078 --> 02:08:36.980]  Also, we've got the Alexa Pure Water Filtration System.
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:37.801]  Highest rated.
[02:08:38.181 --> 02:08:39.322]  Pro-Pure is excellent as well.
[02:08:39.342 --> 02:08:40.302]  They're both apples and oranges.
[02:08:40.703 --> 02:08:41.603]  Gravity-fed systems.
[02:08:41.663 --> 02:08:43.684]  Your children, you, everybody deserves it.
[02:08:44.865 --> 02:08:45.946]  Everything's in the water supply.
[02:08:46.166 --> 02:08:47.127]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:08:47.267 --> 02:08:49.428]  And then the supplements are the very best.
[02:08:49.548 --> 02:08:54.211]  Whatever the top-rated fish oil is from the top company, I go and say, will you private label?
[02:08:56.497 --> 02:08:58.298]  And then they do, but I got a side of contract.
[02:08:58.318 --> 02:08:58.998]  I'm so demonized.
[02:08:59.018 --> 02:08:59.758]  I won't say who they are.
[02:09:00.238 --> 02:09:01.339]  Same thing with the toothpaste.
[02:09:01.859 --> 02:09:04.260]  Same thing with, but ours is proprietary.
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:06.981]  The top organic non-fluoride maker in the country.
[02:09:07.001 --> 02:09:07.801]  Everybody knows its name.
[02:09:08.121 --> 02:09:12.243]  The factory that makes theirs makes ours, but we had the colloidal silver and the iodine is proprietary.
[02:09:12.543 --> 02:09:21.786]  We took three fillers out that are in the other top brands so that you're not just getting a bunch of sand basically, but you're getting all product.
[02:09:22.751 --> 02:09:23.772]  So, it's concentrated.
[02:09:23.892 --> 02:09:27.114]  One tube of Super Blue toothpaste is like two regular tubes.
[02:09:27.514 --> 02:09:28.054]  It's amazing.
[02:09:28.654 --> 02:09:30.355]  So, it's all there.
[02:09:30.375 --> 02:09:34.138]  50% off on the BrainForce Plus and TurboForce Combo.
[02:09:34.478 --> 02:09:41.682]  That is a huge introductory offer and so much more at infowarestore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:09:42.242 --> 02:09:43.883]  And take the Super Silver Wound Gel.
[02:09:44.324 --> 02:09:48.046]  It's the strongest FDA-approved gel on the market.
[02:09:48.166 --> 02:09:50.407]  Anything else is prescription and it's $200 a tube.
[02:09:52.128 --> 02:09:55.249]  Okay, this stuff is the top company.
[02:09:55.590 --> 02:09:56.210]  We have an agreement.
[02:09:56.230 --> 02:09:57.931]  They'll even let us say their name, but I'm not saying their name.
[02:09:58.451 --> 02:09:59.351]  We private label it.
[02:09:59.371 --> 02:10:04.473]  They sell it for $40 at all these big drugstores.
[02:10:05.594 --> 02:10:06.795]  We normally sell it for $30.
[02:10:06.915 --> 02:10:08.455]  It's $22.17 right now.
[02:10:08.835 --> 02:10:14.198]  We're not making much money on this because they had to pay for all the FDA approval and all the rest of it, and we have to pay a lot for it.
[02:10:14.238 --> 02:10:20.941]  But Super Silver is private labeled the strongest nano silver legally on the market.
[02:10:21.801 --> 02:10:23.862]  Not for internal digestion, folks.
[02:10:24.522 --> 02:10:28.623]  But you put it on wounds and things, this is what's used in hospitals.
[02:10:29.104 --> 02:10:32.505]  In fact, there's some debates like, is the prescription stuff even really safe?
[02:10:33.045 --> 02:10:37.406]  Because, I mean, this is already two-thirds as strong as that.
[02:10:38.147 --> 02:10:38.567]  It's there.
[02:10:40.027 --> 02:10:40.888]  It's 40% off.
[02:10:40.988 --> 02:10:41.868]  InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:10:42.028 --> 02:10:44.749]  Okay, going to our guest, who I really appreciate joining us.
[02:10:48.436 --> 02:11:00.783]  Elizabeth Johnston, the Activist Mommy, activistmommy.com, twitter at activist underscore mommy, facebook.com forward slash theactivistmommy, Instagram, and she's got the courage to stand up against these globalists.
[02:11:00.803 --> 02:11:02.764]  We'll play some of the videos and productions she's done.
[02:11:03.084 --> 02:11:09.968]  She's reached billions of people online, hundreds of millions of views every month, and a force to be reckoned with.
[02:11:09.988 --> 02:11:12.750]  I'm not going to go over her old bio, but she's a Christian.
[02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:18.695]  And she's a parent, and she homeschooled her ten beautiful children.
[02:11:19.136 --> 02:11:20.357]  I'm jealous, I've only got four.
[02:11:20.577 --> 02:11:24.121]  So she is as rich as you can get, way richer than Jeff Bezos.
[02:11:24.861 --> 02:11:28.125]  And so we salute her, and she's an amazing person.
[02:11:28.385 --> 02:11:33.150]  She has backyard Bible study clubs, street ministry, pro-life rescue ministry.
[02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:37.033]  She's on fire for Christ, and on fire against this evil.
[02:11:37.814 --> 02:11:39.696]  I've called what's happening a demonic invasion.
[02:11:40.617 --> 02:11:41.818]  I mean, it's like everywhere.
[02:11:41.838 --> 02:11:43.139]  The crazies have gotten crazier.
[02:11:43.399 --> 02:11:46.202]  They're supporting aborting babies after they're born on TV.
[02:11:46.862 --> 02:11:49.144]  They're supporting women being kidnapped and sex slavery.
[02:11:49.465 --> 02:11:50.746]  Cortez won't stand for that.
[02:11:51.787 --> 02:11:57.432]  I mean, it's like they've gone from evil to openly like something out of a cartoon.
[02:11:57.452 --> 02:12:00.815]  A, do you agree with that, activist mommy?
[02:12:01.596 --> 02:12:03.317]  And B, why is it happening?
[02:12:03.337 --> 02:12:03.978]  What's going on?
[02:12:05.592 --> 02:12:06.272]  Absolutely.
[02:12:06.873 --> 02:12:18.277]  Alex, the nation has been reeling ever since Cuomo signed and celebrated the execution of babies up to 40 weeks by lighting up the World Trade Center pink.
[02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:28.882]  My inboxes have been absolutely slammed with citizens who are outraged, who are distressed, and who are saying, I am done with sitting on the sidelines
[02:12:29.372 --> 02:12:30.713]  Help me get on the front lines.
[02:12:31.053 --> 02:12:33.134]  What can we do to end the bloodshed?
[02:12:33.495 --> 02:12:40.799]  And so we have organized on February 23rd, just a couple of weeks away from now, the Day of Mourning.
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:47.884]  We are calling for the whole nation to mourn and repent over the sin of abortion.
[02:12:47.944 --> 02:12:50.105]  We are asking the nation to do four things.
[02:12:50.586 --> 02:12:52.347]  Number one, wear black.
[02:12:52.747 --> 02:12:54.148]  Number two, do not shop.
[02:12:54.793 --> 02:12:57.255]  Number three, close down your businesses.
[02:12:57.375 --> 02:12:59.156]  If you have a business, you can close down.
[02:12:59.316 --> 02:13:03.338]  And lastly, pray with your friends in church or in your home.
[02:13:03.418 --> 02:13:07.921]  Have a gathering, a prayer gathering, and repent for the sin of abortion.
[02:13:08.502 --> 02:13:11.684]  Ultimately, this is not just a horizontal problem, Alex.
[02:13:11.804 --> 02:13:18.848]  It's a vertical problem that we've got to get right with God, that our hearts are not more concerned with the bloodshed of these babies.
[02:13:19.288 --> 02:13:21.930]  Also, we are holding a large rally
[02:13:22.948 --> 02:13:38.875]  Right in the devil's lair in Albany, New York, where the legislation was signed, literally underneath the Statehouse at the very well-known Empire State Plaza Convention Center room that holds 2,400 people.
[02:13:39.255 --> 02:13:49.799]  We're going to be there with speakers like the Venom Brothers and David J. Harris, Jr., the black conservative that many of your listeners are probably familiar with.
[02:13:50.239 --> 02:13:51.660]  Many of us are going to be there.
[02:13:52.401 --> 02:14:03.905]  Sharing, inspiring the listeners, but most importantly, getting on our faces before God and pleading with Him not to judge our country because we are due for a very stiff judgment.
[02:14:04.605 --> 02:14:07.206]  And that's what you're saying is absolutely on target.
[02:14:07.587 --> 02:14:11.388]  These globalists know in this weird satanic alchemy that they can get us to do evil.
[02:14:11.948 --> 02:14:13.008]  It opens the gate up.
[02:14:13.088 --> 02:14:19.031]  And I use the golden child analogy that Eddie Murphy made, but they want to get the golden child to eat the blood of a dead kid so that he's not protected.
[02:14:20.291 --> 02:14:25.455]  They want the hedge taken down and that's why they celebrate killing babies already born.
[02:14:25.475 --> 02:14:33.161]  They celebrate openly doing it and Cortez looking at Trump with pure murderous hate when he's against abortion of already born babies.
[02:14:33.221 --> 02:14:36.063]  I mean these people know what they're doing.
[02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:44.152]  Alex, I am pleading with your listeners to please, your viewers, to go to dayofmourning.org.
[02:14:44.652 --> 02:14:47.833]  You will find there that we have a petition you can sign.
[02:14:48.293 --> 02:14:55.736]  You will find an Eventbrite event so that you can register for the event and it will email you your ticket so that you can get into the Albany
[02:14:56.306 --> 02:14:57.347]  New York event.
[02:14:57.867 --> 02:15:01.670]  You will find a poster, a sign that you can print out if you are a business owner.
[02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:10.536]  You can place that sign on the front door of your business to show that you are standing in solidarity with the pre-born for the day of mourning.
[02:15:10.576 --> 02:15:11.056]  I totally agree.
[02:15:11.096 --> 02:15:12.337]  And this could be a chain reaction.
[02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:13.018]  I'll wear black.
[02:15:13.798 --> 02:15:15.139]  Uh, everybody else should wear black.
[02:15:15.579 --> 02:15:20.361]  And then everybody, I think even the next day, too, should wear black and tell people about the event that happened.
[02:15:20.701 --> 02:15:22.942]  Because I think a catalyst has been reached.
[02:15:22.982 --> 02:15:29.285]  I think a flashpoint happened with this evil governor talking about keeping them comfortable and killing them and all the rest of it.
[02:15:29.405 --> 02:15:33.866]  I think of, I feel a flashpoint with the Covington boys and everything.
[02:15:33.986 --> 02:15:37.408]  I feel a real turning around has happened if we take the initiative.
[02:15:38.496 --> 02:15:39.197]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:15:39.517 --> 02:15:42.681]  You know, I kind of got my finger on the pulse of culture because of what I do.
[02:15:43.261 --> 02:15:56.757]  And let me tell you, I have never seen such righteous anger since, I would say, in 2015 when the Center for Medical Progress Planned Parenthood videos came out showing that Planned Parenthood sells the baby's body parts.
[02:15:57.017 --> 02:15:58.738]  That's right, we're about to launch a major offensive.
[02:15:58.778 --> 02:16:00.999]  Elizabeth Johnston, the activist mom, is our guest.
[02:16:01.019 --> 02:16:02.400]  Stay with us and spread the live feed.
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:07.183]  All the time, people come up to me on the street and they say, man, Alex, how you taking it?
[02:16:07.223 --> 02:16:12.205]  We're sure sorry for you, the boycotts, the demonization, the lies, the lawsuits.
[02:16:12.245 --> 02:16:13.686]  How are you taking it?
[02:16:13.706 --> 02:16:16.468]  And quite frankly, I tell them I'm taking it good.
[02:16:17.188 --> 02:16:23.431]  I'm sad for my children and my family, because sometimes people get in their faces as well and say things about me that aren't true.
[02:16:23.451 --> 02:16:24.472]  But you know what?
[02:16:24.712 --> 02:16:25.873]  It wasn't free.
[02:16:26.934 --> 02:16:35.423]  What our forebears did in 1776, and it wasn't free in the Civil War, and the things we went through to try to end slavery, and other horrible events like that.
[02:16:36.204 --> 02:16:38.726]  But, you know, at the end of the day, that's what makes us who we are.
[02:16:39.888 --> 02:16:42.410]  And so, I'm quite honored to be in this position.
[02:16:43.011 --> 02:16:49.177]  I want to win in the end, and I realize that we are bound together in this struggle.
[02:16:50.131 --> 02:16:57.059]  This isn't just Alex Jones, this is the audience of activists who are in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about.
[02:16:57.579 --> 02:17:05.468]  When you support InfoWars, however you do that, spread the word, praying for us, financially supporting us, and getting great products at the same time, you are
[02:17:05.988 --> 02:17:10.070]  Literally involved in a symbiotic relationship that's already changed the world.
[02:17:10.451 --> 02:17:15.894]  And so they know that we got that witch who was supposed to be the anointed queen defeated in 2016.
[02:17:16.274 --> 02:17:25.720]  They know that together we did that and they don't want to see that happen again with Kamala Harris or with Pocahontas or with Bernie Sanders or any of these other horrible globalists.
[02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:27.820]  And so that's why they're trying to crush us.
[02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:29.961]  Because we changed the world.
[02:17:30.021 --> 02:17:32.661]  We did some incredible things together.
[02:17:32.921 --> 02:17:36.182]  And we can go on and do great things together as well.
[02:17:36.782 --> 02:17:38.382]  America's waking up to the censorship.
[02:17:38.443 --> 02:17:40.723]  America is waking up to the oppression of the tyranny.
[02:17:41.143 --> 02:17:48.965]  There are a lot of rumblings and a lot of creaking and exploding and popping inside the system taking place right now.
[02:17:49.365 --> 02:17:50.185]  So understand this.
[02:17:51.005 --> 02:17:53.766]  The enemy tries to put out this aura of arrogance and supremacy.
[02:17:54.186 --> 02:17:54.986]  But they're not supreme.
[02:17:55.866 --> 02:18:00.988]  And if you look at the videos that they censor most off YouTube and Facebook, it's videos of 2016.
[02:18:01.348 --> 02:18:08.051]  On November 8th, that night, going into November 9th, when Hillary lost.
[02:18:08.151 --> 02:18:10.632]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[02:18:13.939 --> 02:18:18.760]  And those arrogant, smug creatures on the left who are panicking and screaming and freaking out.
[02:18:19.241 --> 02:18:22.962]  They want that memory expunged because they don't want us to have a victory.
[02:18:23.562 --> 02:18:26.843]  InfoWars is under attack and demonized because we're a success story.
[02:18:27.343 --> 02:18:29.383]  And they don't want you to be successful.
[02:18:29.423 --> 02:18:36.446]  They don't want you to believe in yourself and believe in your country and believe in a future destiny for all of us to have a better world than Martin Luther King done to them.
[02:18:36.466 --> 02:18:41.087]  That's why I'm going to leave you with this important analysis with some clips of that night to remind you
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:48.064]  Of how far we've come, and how far we're going to go, and that these arrogant globalists will be defeated.
[02:18:49.025 --> 02:18:56.730]  And then the final equation, please remember, infortrestore.com, because it is your financial support, shopping with us, with the good guys, that's already changed the world.
[02:18:58.431 --> 02:19:02.374]  And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[02:19:02.694 --> 02:19:03.995]  Right now, Donald Trump.
[02:19:08.761 --> 02:19:11.378]  Donald Trump is running for president!
[02:19:11.499 --> 02:19:11.902]  Do it!
[02:19:13.513 --> 02:19:13.873]  Do it.
[02:19:14.293 --> 02:19:14.933]  Look, look at me.
[02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:16.274]  Do it.
[02:19:17.014 --> 02:19:26.776]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[02:19:26.996 --> 02:19:29.397]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[02:19:29.437 --> 02:19:32.057]  So right now we have Hillary as about a 75 or an 80% favorite.
[02:19:32.098 --> 02:19:33.498]  We have different persons.
[02:19:33.578 --> 02:19:35.238]  I think it's a landslide for Hillary.
[02:19:35.258 --> 02:19:37.879]  You still think she has a 100% chance of winning the election?
[02:19:37.939 --> 02:19:38.259]  I do.
[02:19:38.419 --> 02:19:40.680]  We have the presidency at about 89% for Hillary.
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:44.882]  Right now, a historic moment.
[02:19:44.902 --> 02:19:47.564]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[02:19:47.584 --> 02:19:50.827]  CNN projects Donald Trump wins the presidency.
[02:19:50.887 --> 02:19:51.908]  You're awake, by the way.
[02:19:52.589 --> 02:19:54.490]  You're not having a terrible, terrible dream.
[02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:56.792]  Also, you're not dead and you haven't gone to hell.
[02:19:57.473 --> 02:19:58.274]  This is your life now.
[02:19:58.394 --> 02:19:59.294]  This is our election now.
[02:19:59.395 --> 02:19:59.875]  This is us.
[02:20:00.015 --> 02:20:00.676]  This is our country.
[02:20:01.376 --> 02:20:01.697]  It's real.
[02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:10.044]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.009 --> 02:20:28.511]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:29.632 --> 02:20:35.153]  So Elizabeth Johnston, the activist mommy, has reached billions of people online.
[02:20:36.013 --> 02:20:39.114]  She's been married for 19 years and homeschooled her 10 beautiful children.
[02:20:39.734 --> 02:20:42.675]  And I gotta tell you, I'm not gonna say this to be patronizing, because it's the truth.
[02:20:44.636 --> 02:20:54.904]  When you meet Democrat women that are in charge, they're like weird, narcissistic, ignorant, kind of quirky, mentally ill people that, like, don't exist.
[02:20:54.944 --> 02:20:58.947]  Like, you pull a string and they just say things like Alexandria Cortez or Pelosi.
[02:20:59.708 --> 02:21:11.357]  But then you get around women that are Christian and conservative and nationalists, like my grandmothers or my mom, and they're, like, smart and cool and neat, much more so compared to the average
[02:21:12.719 --> 02:21:14.480]  Executive, who's a man you run into.
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:25.543]  And then liberals talk all day about how, and leftists, how smart they are, and NPR, and you know, how great they are, and how they're going to empower women.
[02:21:25.563 --> 02:21:29.264]  And then I go to these Democratic events, and our crews do, and we're not cherry-picking.
[02:21:29.784 --> 02:21:31.487]  Man, it's like they have lobotomies.
[02:21:31.627 --> 02:21:42.025]  It's they're stupid and they're hateful and they revel in killing their babies and it's like central casting for Satan's losers or something.
[02:21:42.105 --> 02:21:43.387]  And then you've got somebody...
[02:21:44.474 --> 02:21:48.138]  Like the activist mommy here with her new book, I can't wait to read it, Not On My Watch.
[02:21:48.639 --> 02:22:00.391]  Well, this is going to be destined to be a bestseller who's powerful and beautiful and effective and smart and has 10 kids and has just all this success and standing up for unborn babies and standing up for born babies now.
[02:22:01.451 --> 02:22:05.513]  That's how far this has gone, and it's like she's not the only one.
[02:22:05.553 --> 02:22:10.496]  If you went to a Christian event with real Christians, or a conservative event, it's like all the women are like that.
[02:22:10.516 --> 02:22:12.597]  They could be black, they could be white, they could be Hispanic.
[02:22:13.097 --> 02:22:17.559]  It's like, you know, I'm married and stuff, but it's like, God, the most sexy women you've ever seen are at a Bible study.
[02:22:17.879 --> 02:22:26.704]  And then you've got all these slave women over here, working for the devil, working with the system, and they have no idea where the real power is with God, and stepping into your real femininity.
[02:22:26.964 --> 02:22:28.825]  And you've got all these weird leftist women,
[02:22:29.685 --> 02:22:40.728]  In their weird white KKK outfits, so tone-deaf with their own garbage they don't even see what they're doing, who won't stand and clap for the unborn or a child already born.
[02:22:40.948 --> 02:22:43.089]  They're so blind they don't know.
[02:22:43.889 --> 02:22:45.209]  Elizabeth, what's wrong with them?
[02:22:45.229 --> 02:22:57.633]  Yeah, how dare those women at the State of the Union address wear white when they have the blood of millions of babies on their hands as they have continued to fight for legislation to kill these babies.
[02:22:58.249 --> 02:23:00.330]  I do call myself the anti-feminist.
[02:23:00.890 --> 02:23:09.954]  The first video that I did that went extremely viral was the initial Women's March that took place in, I think, 2016.
[02:23:10.075 --> 02:23:19.739]  And that one, I think, got 15 million views, where I basically mocked and laughed at the vagina hatters and showed them to be the hypocrites that they are.
[02:23:20.219 --> 02:23:23.941]  But, yeah, the anti-feminist is the title, actually, of one of the chapters
[02:23:24.541 --> 02:23:26.402]  In my book, not on my watch.
[02:23:26.802 --> 02:23:28.283]  I'm really proud of this book.
[02:23:28.303 --> 02:23:36.248]  I believe that it's going to inspire a lot of everyday ordinary citizens because that's what I am, a very ordinary citizen.
[02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:37.782]  Thank you so much.
[02:23:56.492 --> 02:24:02.978]  And a lot of inspiring stories about things that we've done, like the global movement to shut down pornographic sex education.
[02:24:03.318 --> 02:24:04.759]  We shut down sex brothels.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:10.244]  We dealt a huge blow to Teen Vogue magazine, which five months later had to go out of print because of it.
[02:24:11.057 --> 02:24:15.379]  I am just a very simple, ordinary, very busy homeschool mom.
[02:24:15.719 --> 02:24:17.980]  You're not ordinary, and we all know it.
[02:24:18.341 --> 02:24:35.489]  Elizabeth, but seriously, because this isn't about, it's true, and I know you've seen it, everybody's seen it, you go around leftists, they look like they've had their soul sucked out, you get around real Christians, not the fake ones, but the real ones, they're like on fire, like you're just glowing right now, and everything you're saying, and don't people see the difference?
[02:24:35.509 --> 02:24:37.109]  Don't they know the difference?
[02:24:37.149 --> 02:24:38.230]  Why don't they understand it?
[02:24:39.417 --> 02:24:40.298]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:41.218]  I appreciate that.
[02:24:41.358 --> 02:24:42.839]  And I want to meet your listeners.
[02:24:42.879 --> 02:24:43.880]  I want to meet your viewers.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:46.141]  And I'm asking your viewers to please come meet me.
[02:24:46.722 --> 02:24:48.142]  I'll sign my book for you.
[02:24:48.282 --> 02:24:53.746]  I want to pray with you at this event on February 23rd.
[02:24:53.806 --> 02:24:56.988]  That is two Saturdays from now in Albany, New York.
[02:24:57.048 --> 02:24:59.509]  We have a fabulous venue, fabulous speakers.
[02:24:59.930 --> 02:25:04.873]  You're going to the epicenter where they just passed a law to kill babies after they're born and even torture them.
[02:25:05.673 --> 02:25:08.055]  We are literally underneath the State House building.
[02:25:08.115 --> 02:25:08.475]  It's like
[02:25:08.948 --> 02:25:12.689]  It's like Satan thought he had crushed us, but he didn't realize we were seeds.
[02:25:12.709 --> 02:25:17.050]  So we're going to be the seeds underneath the ground where they signed that legislation.
[02:25:17.090 --> 02:25:19.431]  And because of it, we are going to rise.
[02:25:19.971 --> 02:25:25.733]  I know you have a lot of generous listeners, and I am asking them to please help us and donate.
[02:25:26.053 --> 02:25:28.654]  We have $20,000 of expenses right now.
[02:25:29.207 --> 02:25:31.289]  And we do not have the money to pay for this event.
[02:25:31.329 --> 02:25:32.570]  It's so frustrating, Alex.
[02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:42.238]  George Soros and his minions have all the money in the world, and I just need $20,000 to help rescue these babies and call our nation to repentance over this bloodshed.
[02:25:42.278 --> 02:25:42.838]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:25:42.918 --> 02:25:45.320]  And that's what this broadcast is about, where people feel led to give.
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:46.321]  This is a great place to do it.
[02:25:46.881 --> 02:25:53.525]  We just need the fuel and the energy to get our people in place and to fight these globalists and to take them on.
[02:25:53.585 --> 02:25:57.547]  Soros put $80-plus billion in the last year trying to crush the liberty movement worldwide.
[02:25:57.787 --> 02:25:59.107]  He totally panicked.
[02:25:59.147 --> 02:26:05.431]  He committed his entire arsenal, $38 billion, excuse me, his entire arsenal against everybody, and it still is failing.
[02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:06.191]  So, day of mourning.
[02:26:06.531 --> 02:26:08.332]  Very, very exciting that that's coming up.
[02:26:08.672 --> 02:26:13.675]  Getting back to this, though, because you said you have your finger on the pulse, and I agree with you, and I have mine on the pulse.
[02:26:15.234 --> 02:26:26.097]  I have seen, just the last three weeks, the commitment, the energy, the focus, the dedication explode by conservatives and nationalists and Christians.
[02:26:26.237 --> 02:26:29.477]  And I think it was the Covington kids triggered it.
[02:26:29.517 --> 02:26:33.898]  And if we didn't have activist reporters out there documenting it, like our reporters did, we wouldn't have known.
[02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:40.040]  And if we didn't have you out there, and if we didn't have Kaitlin Bennett out there and Millie Weaver, that's why other listeners have to know.
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:41.941]  If you can't donate, fine.
[02:26:42.021 --> 02:26:49.746]  Or if you can't even spread the word, you can get a YouTube channel on the Enemy Platform, or you can go out and just videotape what's happening.
[02:26:50.247 --> 02:26:53.769]  Our eyes and ears being out there hitting the streets is critical.
[02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.870]  Absolutely.
[02:26:55.890 --> 02:27:08.339]  And like I said, I've not seen rage like this and concern and desire to activate since the Planned Parenthood videos that exposed, the undercover videos exposed that they were selling the baby body parts.
[02:27:08.599 --> 02:27:09.940]  But this would even trump
[02:27:10.623 --> 02:27:11.787]  That's amazing.
[02:27:18.583 --> 02:27:29.988]  Ginsburg is probably going to die soon and they know that Trump is going to get another Supreme Court pick and they are horrified that they're not going to be able to kill these babies.
[02:27:30.388 --> 02:27:40.693]  They're horrified that they are not going to be able to offer the blood of these babies up to, you know, ultimately the God of convenience and sacrifice these children.
[02:27:41.493 --> 02:27:44.056]  It's unthinkable, but they're actually horrified by this.
[02:27:44.156 --> 02:27:57.407]  And so they're now going to do this effort of state by state, New York, Virginia, they're all going to try to get abortion legal through all 40 weeks so that they don't lose the opportunity to shed blood.
[02:27:57.467 --> 02:27:57.667]  Look.
[02:27:58.354 --> 02:28:00.357]  We are done with half measures.
[02:28:00.437 --> 02:28:05.124]  We are done with this, oh, just don't kill the baby as long as they're, you know, 20 weeks.
[02:28:05.424 --> 02:28:13.216]  No, we need to end all the killing and we need to repent in the church of our bigotry, Alex, because we're concerned about a baby killed at 40 weeks.
[02:28:13.536 --> 02:28:16.338]  But we're not so concerned about the baby when they're just nine weeks old.
[02:28:16.358 --> 02:28:16.718]  No, you're right.
[02:28:16.738 --> 02:28:21.802]  We've compromised and now they're saying we're gonna kill grandma, we're gonna kill newborn kids.
[02:28:22.062 --> 02:28:23.443]  That's the globalist UN model.
[02:28:23.983 --> 02:28:32.729]  Peter Singer, that's like the head guru of PETA and kind of the head transhumanist, he wrote in books 30 years ago, parents should be able to kill their kids up to age three.
[02:28:33.905 --> 02:28:34.165]  Yes.
[02:28:34.685 --> 02:28:36.046]  You know exactly how it works.
[02:28:36.166 --> 02:28:44.487]  You know, your viewers have probably read the book The Naked Communists, and they know how the Marxists progress their agenda.
[02:28:44.968 --> 02:28:50.329]  And we need to stop taking scraps from under the table, and we need to end the killing.
[02:28:50.509 --> 02:28:54.590]  We need to go on the offense, and Elizabeth Johnston, the activist mom, is doing it.
[02:28:54.970 --> 02:28:55.870]  Infowars is doing it.
[02:28:55.930 --> 02:28:56.790]  Our listeners are doing it.
[02:28:56.890 --> 02:28:57.530]  We're doing it.
[02:28:57.911 --> 02:28:59.231]  For our children, for us all.
[02:28:59.251 --> 02:28:59.671]  Stay with us.
[02:29:03.146 --> 02:29:04.808]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[02:29:05.588 --> 02:29:07.570]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:29:08.692 --> 02:29:09.673]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:09.953 --> 02:29:14.997]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[02:29:15.117 --> 02:29:16.758]  I wanted to say I love your products.
[02:29:16.978 --> 02:29:19.280]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:24.564]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[02:29:24.584 --> 02:29:35.271]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain focus energy products were and we decided to make it even stronger
[02:29:36.232 --> 02:29:40.035]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[02:29:40.575 --> 02:29:42.436]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:42.536 --> 02:29:46.639]  It is our number one best seller in gross bottles sold.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:51.923]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[02:29:52.563 --> 02:29:59.985]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market, get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[02:30:00.365 --> 02:30:03.905]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of that I'm going to use.
[02:30:04.345 --> 02:30:05.586]  It's up there as the very best.
[02:30:05.906 --> 02:30:10.027]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good, that have some of the similar ingredients.
[02:30:10.667 --> 02:30:13.627]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[02:30:14.768 --> 02:30:21.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[02:30:22.381 --> 02:30:22.561]  I don't
[02:30:42.848 --> 02:30:48.910]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:53.091]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:54.552]  Long burn.
[02:30:54.572 --> 02:30:56.772]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[02:30:56.832 --> 02:30:57.893]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[02:30:58.273 --> 02:30:59.273]  And I take about a half a packet.
[02:30:59.293 --> 02:30:59.813]  It's so strong.
[02:31:00.153 --> 02:31:05.735]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[02:31:06.499 --> 02:31:20.821]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together, to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[02:31:20.901 --> 02:31:27.523]  It's 33% off, and you get it in a combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at InformedStore.com.
[02:31:28.003 --> 02:31:30.603]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[02:31:31.103 --> 02:31:35.424]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:39.864]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[02:31:40.224 --> 02:31:41.786]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[02:31:42.327 --> 02:31:45.911]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[02:31:46.371 --> 02:31:51.296]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[02:31:52.401 --> 02:32:00.183]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[02:32:00.543 --> 02:32:05.745]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[02:32:06.305 --> 02:32:09.666]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[02:32:11.192 --> 02:32:11.613]  See what I mean?
[02:32:11.893 --> 02:32:19.842]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, that's your next phase, you get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[02:32:20.222 --> 02:32:24.006]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[02:32:24.447 --> 02:32:25.268]  Boost in the morning!
[02:32:26.209 --> 02:32:31.410]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[02:32:32.110 --> 02:32:34.271]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[02:32:34.391 --> 02:32:37.272]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[02:32:37.692 --> 02:32:44.913]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[02:32:45.453 --> 02:32:46.454]  And all thanks to TurboForce.
[02:32:47.154 --> 02:32:51.735]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[02:32:52.515 --> 02:32:56.758]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product, the InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:32:56.978 --> 02:32:58.479]  Get that energy combo today.
[02:32:58.759 --> 02:33:00.300]  Oh, and fund the InfoWars and change the world.
[02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:01.341]  I forgot about that part too.
[02:33:06.584 --> 02:33:09.226]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.973 --> 02:33:29.614]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:30.134 --> 02:33:31.595]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.195 --> 02:33:36.416]  So we've got major censorship news.
[02:33:36.576 --> 02:33:42.718]  Now, I didn't even mention today that we were banned yesterday on 22 Facebook accounts.
[02:33:43.698 --> 02:33:45.999]  Only two of them did we have some affiliation with.
[02:33:46.019 --> 02:33:46.639]  They weren't ours.
[02:33:47.039 --> 02:33:48.960]  Most of them I never heard of except they were all exploding.
[02:33:50.242 --> 02:33:53.783]  And they called it recidivism, which means criminals committing new crimes.
[02:33:54.463 --> 02:34:10.288]  So citizens went and created Facebook pages that say InfoWars and Facebook put a press release out and said, if it says wars in it, InfoWars, NewsWars, we will take your page down.
[02:34:10.308 --> 02:34:14.330]  So they're saying, you build a page and you talk about Alex Jones, we're going to ban you.
[02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:17.671]  So see now, it's not just banning me, this big, evil, horrible person.
[02:34:19.085 --> 02:34:21.486]  It's now what we first thought it was.
[02:34:23.007 --> 02:34:33.693]  When that YouTube group that was even anti-Alex Jones got a strike that first day I was banned back in August of last year, they banned or blocked another site to let them know, no, no, no, you don't talk about him.
[02:34:34.134 --> 02:34:36.295]  Total social conditioning.
[02:34:36.335 --> 02:34:38.796]  And then they tell Congress, we don't censor anything.
[02:34:38.836 --> 02:34:40.497]  We don't know what you're talking about.
[02:34:40.517 --> 02:34:41.798]  We have all the internal emails.
[02:34:42.178 --> 02:34:43.379]  We have the undercover videos.
[02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:45.130]  We have it all.
[02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:50.334]  Well, I'll do a little bit of the next hour after our guest leaves us, and Rob Dews is printing it all off for me.
[02:34:50.534 --> 02:34:52.235]  Rob Dews, the Nightly News director.
[02:34:53.596 --> 02:35:07.545]  But he put out a video about Maduro's death squads killing people and just showed a link to a BBC video.
[02:35:10.728 --> 02:35:11.749]  That everybody else could air.
[02:35:11.789 --> 02:35:16.933]  He said, wow, look at the nightmare of socialism that Alexandria Cortez and Bernie Sanders want to give us.
[02:35:17.554 --> 02:35:18.655]  And somebody countered back.
[02:35:19.415 --> 02:35:20.136]  Oh, shut up.
[02:35:20.216 --> 02:35:25.640]  It's the American police killing black people, even though whites are about two to one killed for blacks.
[02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:28.343]  But you could argue there's some bad police or some good police.
[02:35:28.783 --> 02:35:31.005]  Point is, it's a big divide and conquer strategy.
[02:35:32.806 --> 02:35:37.910]  And he said, no, here's the statistics that more than twice as many whites get killed than blacks on and on and on.
[02:35:38.291 --> 02:35:39.612]  And by the way, learn to code.
[02:35:40.865 --> 02:35:47.006]  Because the left always said, you're a coal miner, you're a Ford worker, you're a farmer, you lost your job, learn to code.
[02:35:47.826 --> 02:35:48.386]  Learn to code.
[02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:49.646]  We're there in that 20 years.
[02:35:50.107 --> 02:35:51.187]  Learn to code!
[02:35:52.127 --> 02:36:01.408]  So now there's all these big layoffs in the, you know, BuzzFeed sphere of fake news because the money got cut off.
[02:36:02.289 --> 02:36:10.050]  And while you don't say that to the delicate little authoritarians who are so creepy and so unchivalrous and so evil, dude's bringing it all into me right now.
[02:36:11.013 --> 02:36:19.214]  That they ban you when you say it, and then Jack Dorsey goes on Joe Rogan's Snake Farm experience.
[02:36:19.995 --> 02:36:20.875]  Yeah, yeah, document cam.
[02:36:21.135 --> 02:36:21.675]  Bring a mic in here.
[02:36:22.475 --> 02:36:23.235]  We'll go to our guest.
[02:36:23.255 --> 02:36:24.215]  She understands this is breaking news.
[02:36:25.255 --> 02:36:25.996]  This is what we're fighting.
[02:36:27.196 --> 02:36:28.076]  Document cam shot, please.
[02:36:28.656 --> 02:36:29.136]  So here it is.
[02:36:30.176 --> 02:36:34.417]  The following message has been approved by Et Sanders and AOC.
[02:36:34.537 --> 02:36:39.278]  Enjoy your socialism now with improved motorcycle death squats.
[02:36:40.117 --> 02:36:43.538]  And then it links to mainstream news with motorcycle death squads going on.
[02:36:43.578 --> 02:36:45.479]  So CNN can show you that, but he can't.
[02:36:45.759 --> 02:36:48.760]  Looks like they learned from American police shooting African-Americans.
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:51.521]  Meanwhile, half the blacks get aborted in the country.
[02:36:51.541 --> 02:36:52.141]  We're trying to stop it.
[02:36:53.762 --> 02:36:55.903]  Two Sanders in the groups.
[02:36:56.003 --> 02:36:57.443]  Police kill more whites than blacks.
[02:36:57.903 --> 02:36:59.544]  You link to the statistic, learn to code.
[02:37:00.364 --> 02:37:00.624]  Boom.
[02:37:01.144 --> 02:37:02.445]  Then Twitter tells you.
[02:37:04.349 --> 02:37:06.551]  You agree to remove this or you won't ever be restored?
[02:37:06.771 --> 02:37:07.011]  Right.
[02:37:07.671 --> 02:37:08.332]  And that'll be in 14 days.
[02:37:08.392 --> 02:37:09.633]  And that's my response to this.
[02:37:09.653 --> 02:37:09.993]  Appeal!
[02:37:10.213 --> 02:37:11.214]  Yeah, so I appealed it.
[02:37:11.234 --> 02:37:11.894]  Tell people about it.
[02:37:11.914 --> 02:37:12.094]  Sure.
[02:37:12.415 --> 02:37:13.155]  Tell people about it.
[02:37:13.175 --> 02:37:13.335]  Sure.
[02:37:13.675 --> 02:37:14.536]  We'll go to our guest.
[02:37:15.076 --> 02:37:24.683]  So I basically appealed it and said, uh, this is a response to a guy saying, looks like, and I even quote him in there, that looks like they learned shooting American, uh, look, from American police shooting African Americans.
[02:37:24.723 --> 02:37:25.464]  And I just sent a link.
[02:37:26.164 --> 02:37:29.490]  To a group that's been tracking this since the year 2000 of the deaths.
[02:37:30.011 --> 02:37:35.741]  And there's about 8,000 whites, there's some unspecified number, and then there's like 5,000 blacks.
[02:37:35.821 --> 02:37:36.182]  I mean it's...
[02:37:37.408 --> 02:37:39.510]  All I did was show proof.
[02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:40.511]  It's FBI statistics.
[02:37:40.551 --> 02:37:52.000]  So, somebody says, cops are targeting black people, you send a link proving it's not the case, in the main, obviously some are, some aren't, and then you get banned for that.
[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:52.541]  I get banned.
[02:37:52.841 --> 02:37:57.385]  And it's probably for this learn to code thing, which I didn't even tell him to learn to code, it's just a hashtag.
[02:37:57.445 --> 02:38:00.267]  It's because you're effective and you're accurate and you're real.
[02:38:00.908 --> 02:38:01.969]  And here's the problem.
[02:38:02.529 --> 02:38:07.253]  We're looking at who to sue over this, and Twitter's one of the main ones, but there's more than one way to skid a cat.
[02:38:07.293 --> 02:38:13.197]  We're just gonna get Securities and Exchange Commission indictments for folks instead.
[02:38:13.217 --> 02:38:14.719]  Like, you know, we're not gonna play your game.
[02:38:15.059 --> 02:38:20.023]  And when you get indicted, Joe, or you get indicted, Jack, we'll just say, you haven't been indicted!
[02:38:20.363 --> 02:38:21.184]  Yeah, it doesn't exist.
[02:38:22.486 --> 02:38:23.987]  So, and it's ridiculous.
[02:38:24.167 --> 02:38:25.668]  Kellen's working on an article right now.
[02:38:26.288 --> 02:38:28.069]  Oh, they're hitting everybody right now.
[02:38:28.209 --> 02:38:34.934]  Yeah, and they're literally going through it, because I did one tweet to John Brennan, who basically just, he gets to say whatever he wants.
[02:38:34.954 --> 02:38:37.855]  You say anything against the former CIA director, suddenly you're a bad person.
[02:38:38.136 --> 02:38:39.476]  He's a total public figure.
[02:38:39.676 --> 02:38:39.897]  Yeah.
[02:38:39.977 --> 02:38:41.458]  He says we're going to take the president out.
[02:38:41.838 --> 02:38:43.419]  He says all this, and you call him a wimp.
[02:38:43.639 --> 02:38:45.900]  Yeah, I called him a wimp, and they're like, oh no, you can't do that.
[02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:46.881]  That violates our rules.
[02:38:46.961 --> 02:38:50.263]  And I'm like, the word I use is just another name for your mouth.
[02:38:51.658 --> 02:38:53.899]  A puss, you know, that's all I said.
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:57.061]  It's flapping in the wind, that's all I, you know, and that's not even that bad.
[02:38:57.221 --> 02:38:58.762]  Like, I didn't cuss him out, I didn't do anything.
[02:38:58.802 --> 02:39:01.624]  They can use Twitter to organize going to Tucker Carlson's house.
[02:39:01.644 --> 02:39:01.884]  Sure.
[02:39:01.904 --> 02:39:04.505]  Alright, Rob, we'll follow this as it unfolds.
[02:39:04.905 --> 02:39:09.008]  Just absolute reign of terror, and then they go on TV and say nobody.
[02:39:10.367 --> 02:39:12.389]  Alex, this will end when God's people decide it's going to end.
[02:39:38.066 --> 02:39:41.809]  When we get off of the sidelines and get engaged in this battle, this will end.
[02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:46.292]  And it has been our silence and our apathy that has caused it to go this far.
[02:39:46.332 --> 02:39:54.217]  And that is why we are joining together to repent on February 23rd for our apathy, for our lack of action.
[02:39:54.237 --> 02:39:56.199]  And let me tell you, your viewers are just going to love this.
[02:39:56.219 --> 02:40:04.284]  If you go to the website dayofmorning.org, you'll see a business poster there that we are asking businesses to place on their front door.
[02:40:04.384 --> 02:40:05.005]  Shut it down.
[02:40:05.552 --> 02:40:13.897]  America should be like a ghost town on Saturday, February 23rd, as we all seek God to change our hearts and grant us repentance.
[02:40:14.157 --> 02:40:24.943]  But on this poster, Alex, it says this business is shut down for the day because we will not allow our state, a tyrannical state, murderous state, to collect sales tax from us.
[02:40:25.343 --> 02:40:34.428]  Tomorrow we will reopen or Monday we will reopen under duress, forced to collect tax in this tyrannical, murderous regime.
[02:40:34.873 --> 02:40:35.273]  I think so.
[02:40:51.049 --> 02:40:58.754]  He loaned me $2,000 from his account to give to the event because we're buying our speakers plane tickets and we do not have the funds to continue.
[02:40:59.075 --> 02:41:00.996]  And so I know you have a generous audience.
[02:41:01.296 --> 02:41:04.018]  Would you please donate to dayofmourning.org?
[02:41:04.098 --> 02:41:05.759]  It is tax deductible.
[02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:08.672]  Um, so we really, really do need your support.
[02:41:08.692 --> 02:41:09.153]  Absolutely.
[02:41:09.193 --> 02:41:11.575]  People need to do it and they need to get out to these events.
[02:41:12.076 --> 02:41:18.243]  And I love the fact you're going to Albany, the capital of New York City, or New York State, where they did all this.
[02:41:18.904 --> 02:41:20.466]  And it's just so sick.
[02:41:20.826 --> 02:41:22.448]  I'm sure you've seen the video when they signed it.
[02:41:23.169 --> 02:41:24.690]  It was like they won the Super Bowl.
[02:41:24.730 --> 02:41:28.313]  They were just like, oh, it's for women to kill their babies after they're born.
[02:41:28.693 --> 02:41:33.936]  But really, it's all about now we're going to be able to legally sell their organs, you know, because they've been doing it under the table.
[02:41:34.097 --> 02:41:36.398]  Now, boy, they're really doing it out in the open.
[02:41:36.418 --> 02:41:38.399]  This was a giant satanic event.
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:39.800]  Sick.
[02:41:40.361 --> 02:41:43.523]  And, you know, the exciting thing about what we're doing with Day of Mourning is that
[02:41:44.184 --> 02:41:47.925]  All of these local rallies are popping up, and you'll see them.
[02:41:47.965 --> 02:41:55.627]  We're starting to connect those to our Day of Mourning Facebook page, because people who can't make it to Albany, New York, are desperate to do something locally.
[02:41:55.927 --> 02:42:02.229]  And so they're organizing Facebook event pages in Colorado, in Georgia, and North Carolina.
[02:42:02.269 --> 02:42:07.531]  We've got events popping up everywhere, very organically, kind of like the Vagina Hatters and the Women's March.
[02:42:07.751 --> 02:42:10.792]  Look, if they can get a million people out to their
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:19.227]  Marches to march for the right to kill babies and to, you know, have same-sex relations and whatnot, same-sex marriage.
[02:42:19.787 --> 02:42:24.351]  Can we get 2,400 people to fill the Empire State Plaza Convention Center for Righteousness?
[02:42:24.711 --> 02:42:25.151]  Please?
[02:42:26.072 --> 02:42:26.733]  I think we can.
[02:42:27.608 --> 02:42:28.589]  I think we can as well.
[02:42:30.252 --> 02:42:31.453]  Overall, we'll come back for a few minutes.
[02:42:31.974 --> 02:42:41.186]  Your report card on Trump, because we can say, OK, Trump's doing great compared to Alexandria Cortez or Nancy Pelosi or, you know, Chuckie Schumer.
[02:42:41.226 --> 02:42:44.590]  But what does Trump need to do on the front of censorship?
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:46.680]  On the front of all this.
[02:42:47.301 --> 02:42:51.102]  Because if he just keeps letting Big Tech, and like he's doing with this new NAFTA bill.
[02:42:51.162 --> 02:42:53.042]  This new NAFTA bill is horrible.
[02:42:53.062 --> 02:42:54.443]  It just legalizes all the censorship.
[02:42:54.843 --> 02:42:56.203]  People really need to call the White House.
[02:42:56.223 --> 02:42:56.924]  They need to get involved.
[02:42:57.644 --> 02:42:59.404]  This is a participation sport, folks.
[02:42:59.424 --> 02:43:00.185]  We appreciate the listeners.
[02:43:00.445 --> 02:43:00.885]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:09.162 --> 02:43:10.663]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[02:43:10.683 --> 02:43:12.045]  She wants to talk about the Virginia governor.
[02:43:12.525 --> 02:43:13.446]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[02:43:13.466 --> 02:43:15.247]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[02:43:15.287 --> 02:43:15.708]  What do you think?
[02:43:16.288 --> 02:43:17.129]  I hope so.
[02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:19.571]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[02:43:19.811 --> 02:43:27.638]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him, and that was a big... I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:30.279]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[02:43:30.299 --> 02:43:35.221]  I can't really do his fake southern accent, but it's just, I love southerners, you know, I'm from Texas, kind of southern.
[02:43:35.301 --> 02:43:42.723]  But it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area, kill that baby.
[02:43:42.883 --> 02:43:48.685]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people, you know, kind of responding to that voice he does.
[02:43:48.745 --> 02:43:53.487]  But it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[02:43:53.527 --> 02:43:55.548]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[02:43:56.688 --> 02:43:58.249]  Oh my gosh, it's so sickening.
[02:43:58.329 --> 02:44:00.969]  Well, we know in end times this is the stuff that happens.
[02:44:01.009 --> 02:44:06.051]  That's why I'm so proud of you and the InfoWorks team for all that you do.
[02:44:06.231 --> 02:44:08.572]  And I love, I wanted to say I love your products.
[02:44:08.812 --> 02:44:14.013]  I have X2 and the Selenium for my thyroid and I have to say that it's worked wonders.
[02:44:14.113 --> 02:44:16.454]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:44:16.774 --> 02:44:21.055]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[02:44:21.415 --> 02:44:26.417]  And usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue and that helps tremendously.
[02:44:26.457 --> 02:44:28.517]  And the knockout helps me sleep at night.
[02:44:28.618 --> 02:44:33.679]  Especially when I have something important I have to get up and do in the morning and I don't feel that groggy feeling.
[02:44:33.779 --> 02:44:35.000]  And we use the toothpaste.
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:36.240]  We love the toothpaste.
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:40.001]  My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with.
[02:44:40.041 --> 02:44:42.582]  My husband is a hardwood floor installer.
[02:44:42.662 --> 02:44:45.883]  He loves the bodies and he loves the Red Pill Plus.
[02:44:45.983 --> 02:44:47.844]  And we're going to try the Turbo Force next.
[02:44:48.444 --> 02:44:53.189]  I really want to get that turbo force because my son loves going to the gym and he needs something for a booze.
[02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:55.871]  Well, Jessie, I appreciate your support, but let me be honest with you.
[02:44:55.912 --> 02:44:57.273]  Only take a half pack at the first time.
[02:44:57.413 --> 02:44:59.335]  It's just, it's kind of like good crack.
[02:44:59.515 --> 02:45:01.517]  So, I'm almost embarrassed.
[02:45:01.957 --> 02:45:03.158]  Everybody should be careful with it.
[02:45:03.599 --> 02:45:04.299]  It's the next level.
[02:45:04.359 --> 02:45:04.780]  It's insane.
[02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:19.177]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty and I don't know what where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you on air who have just stayed strong through it all.
[02:45:19.197 --> 02:45:24.624]  So I just want to encourage you just to keep going, keep fighting for us and with us because I don't know
[02:45:24.964 --> 02:45:25.985]  I don't know what we would do.
[02:45:26.025 --> 02:45:27.106]  We wouldn't have anybody.
[02:45:27.126 --> 02:45:31.189]  If there wasn't you, I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[02:45:31.310 --> 02:45:38.095]  Like you said, you're the tip of the spear, so I really appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth.
[02:45:38.195 --> 02:45:47.824]  It helps me stay connected to God, and I can't say enough about how much I love InfoWars, how much I love the products, but I would like to have some female cut shirts.
[02:45:48.984 --> 02:45:50.885]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:45:51.725 --> 02:45:54.666]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt and it was a big hit.
[02:45:54.786 --> 02:45:55.706]  And we're just brain dead.
[02:45:55.726 --> 02:45:57.486]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint.
[02:45:57.506 --> 02:45:58.167]  It's from women.
[02:45:58.187 --> 02:46:00.127]  We've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females.
[02:46:00.187 --> 02:46:01.167]  We will get it done for you.
[02:46:01.187 --> 02:46:03.248]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on.
[02:46:03.408 --> 02:46:04.748]  And your husband, and your family.
[02:46:04.868 --> 02:46:06.289]  Because just hearing what's in your voice.
[02:46:06.769 --> 02:46:09.971]  The powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together.
[02:46:10.191 --> 02:46:13.854]  All of us focused together against the globalists is unstoppable.
[02:46:14.234 --> 02:46:18.757]  And that's why they're attacking that sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[02:46:19.037 --> 02:46:19.958]  We are humanity.
[02:46:20.258 --> 02:46:21.239]  We are the experience.
[02:46:21.259 --> 02:46:22.019]  We are everything.
[02:46:22.439 --> 02:46:24.261]  And so you've just got my commitment to fight on.
[02:46:24.281 --> 02:46:26.542]  But let me tell you, I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[02:46:26.582 --> 02:46:27.122]  I'm burnt out.
[02:46:27.483 --> 02:46:28.183]  Hearing you.
[02:46:28.283 --> 02:46:29.444]  I don't want to just say this.
[02:46:29.464 --> 02:46:30.264]  I'm not just telling you this.
[02:46:30.785 --> 02:46:31.906]  You are the info war.
[02:46:31.986 --> 02:46:33.286]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[02:46:34.367 --> 02:46:38.131]  That's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth!
[02:46:38.251 --> 02:46:39.312]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[02:46:39.452 --> 02:46:42.955]  If you weren't here, standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[02:46:43.176 --> 02:46:44.377]  But we're in this together.
[02:46:44.537 --> 02:46:46.158]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[02:46:46.178 --> 02:46:49.602]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic gremlin governor.
[02:46:49.782 --> 02:46:51.163]  Of course he's KKK.
[02:46:51.303 --> 02:46:53.445]  Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[02:46:53.485 --> 02:46:54.887]  That's what that's all really about.
[02:46:55.347 --> 02:46:56.548]  These are demons.
[02:46:57.069 --> 02:46:58.570]  But thanks to you and others, we're gonna win.
[02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:59.291]  Thank you so much.
[02:47:06.614 --> 02:47:09.230]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.625 --> 02:47:33.507]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:34.588 --> 02:47:39.350]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:53.938]  So, the spokeswoman for the RNC put on her online account that Elizabeth Warren falsified her
[02:47:57.026 --> 02:48:00.448]  Entrance to the bar of Texas because her scores weren't high enough.
[02:48:01.689 --> 02:48:04.110]  She used affirmative action saying she was Native American to get in.
[02:48:06.872 --> 02:48:09.554]  And once Congress complained, then Instagram backed off.
[02:48:09.654 --> 02:48:10.334]  That's an example.
[02:48:10.374 --> 02:48:11.595]  See, you complain, they back off.
[02:48:12.195 --> 02:48:14.396]  They only back off if you have legislative power.
[02:48:14.977 --> 02:48:16.718]  Everybody else is getting censored en masse.
[02:48:17.378 --> 02:48:20.040]  And it's gone from bad to absolutely insane.
[02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:23.502]  And if Congress and President Trump don't take action,
[02:48:24.892 --> 02:48:27.173]  We would have won the battle, but lost the war.
[02:48:27.793 --> 02:48:31.015]  Elizabeth Johnson, the activist mommy, activistmommy.com.
[02:48:31.655 --> 02:48:34.017]  Again, if you just joined us, I'm Alex Jones, thenfulwars.com.
[02:48:35.477 --> 02:48:37.558]  I think, you know, I want to support Trump.
[02:48:37.598 --> 02:48:48.644]  He's obviously a lot better than the Democrats, but if he doesn't take action on censorship and some of these other issues, then I don't know why he would leave his flank completely open.
[02:48:49.044 --> 02:48:52.726]  This new NAFTA negotiation he has puts into law censorship.
[02:48:53.386 --> 02:48:54.487]  So I'm really concerned.
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:49:00.766]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to do something about this.
[02:49:00.846 --> 02:49:02.547]  I'm not sure what the delay is.
[02:49:02.567 --> 02:49:07.172]  I personally have experienced a whole lot of censorship over the last two years.
[02:49:07.253 --> 02:49:12.138]  In fact, a story about me that really increased the size of my platform.
[02:49:12.617 --> 02:49:12.977]  I don't know.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:32.680]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:32.700 --> 02:49:33.881]  No, no, you're right, exactly.
[02:49:34.161 --> 02:49:34.581]  Continue.
[02:49:34.741 --> 02:49:40.783]  Yeah, and so I have been, you know, pulled, banned from Twitter multiple times, Facebook multiple times.
[02:49:41.183 --> 02:49:42.524]  I'm shadow banned on Twitter.
[02:49:42.624 --> 02:49:45.165]  My tweets are actually marked as graphic.
[02:49:45.646 --> 02:49:47.907]  You don't want to kill babies to your band.
[02:49:47.927 --> 02:49:48.247]  No, exactly.
[02:50:04.557 --> 02:50:08.719]  Right, and definitely something could and must be done about this.
[02:50:08.899 --> 02:50:20.264]  I quickly joined Parley when I learned that Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, was over there, and other large conservatives like Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk.
[02:50:20.645 --> 02:50:34.051]  And I'm hoping that once Parley really gets all the bugs out of their system and is large enough to handle, I'm hoping that Trump is going to move there and that that's going to destroy Twitter, because Twitter must be destroyed.
[02:50:34.844 --> 02:50:35.384]  No, I agree.
[02:50:35.464 --> 02:50:41.688]  If Trump would just start promoting every day, he won't even, like, talk about Infowars or Breitbart or whatever.
[02:50:42.008 --> 02:50:42.909]  It's not like we need that.
[02:50:42.969 --> 02:50:44.270]  We brought Trump to where he is.
[02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:47.611]  Our Lizards created the wave he surfed in on, which is fine.
[02:50:47.671 --> 02:50:52.935]  I get that they attack him and they, you know, they demonize Infowars so he won't link up with it because that would be total victory.
[02:50:53.815 --> 02:50:58.119]  But I've been told about some other social networks that are about to be launching, too, that are independent.
[02:50:58.199 --> 02:50:59.260]  And of course, those will be demonized.
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:04.364]  They'll try to shut those down because Silicon Valley wants a major, major monopoly.
[02:51:04.704 --> 02:51:09.428]  OK, well, Elizabeth Johnston, the activist mommy, we look forward to having you back on.
[02:51:09.829 --> 02:51:15.914]  I'll probably try to cover in a couple of weeks your big day of mourning for the children that have been murdered.
[02:51:15.934 --> 02:51:18.036]  So thanks so much for coming on with us.
[02:51:18.056 --> 02:51:18.736]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:18.756 --> 02:51:19.437]  God bless you.
[02:51:19.837 --> 02:51:20.298]  God bless you.
[02:51:21.491 --> 02:51:24.952]  Okay, I covered a lot here today, and there's a lot I didn't cover.
[02:51:25.673 --> 02:51:29.294]  And we got Doug Hagman with the Hagman Report hosting the fourth hour.
[02:51:29.354 --> 02:51:30.395]  He's always ready to go.
[02:51:31.715 --> 02:51:34.536]  And there's a lot that I want to get to that I haven't gotten to.
[02:51:34.617 --> 02:51:42.120]  So today will be a day where I'm going to stay late, and there'll be some live feeds on InfoWars.com.
[02:51:44.221 --> 02:51:45.261]  And just remember,
[02:51:47.039 --> 02:51:53.622]  This isn't words, because I know everybody hears hype, and there's thousands of channels, and... This is the channel they're trying to shut down.
[02:51:55.883 --> 02:51:56.843]  This is what they don't want on there.
[02:51:58.904 --> 02:52:06.407]  This is the wild card, time and time again, when nobody else is covering it, we're covering it, it breaks out, and it defeats them.
[02:52:08.367 --> 02:52:13.610]  So, if you want to defeat the globalists, just keep doing what you've already been doing.
[02:52:13.650 --> 02:52:14.130]  Remember,
[02:52:15.734 --> 02:52:21.140]  That yeah, you can get censored or banned on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook for promoting an InfoWars.com link.
[02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:21.861]  So we make it easier.
[02:52:22.021 --> 02:52:22.942]  Promote a NewsWars link.
[02:52:23.482 --> 02:52:25.424]  That doesn't get you banned 10% as much.
[02:52:26.045 --> 02:52:26.686]  But who cares?
[02:52:27.827 --> 02:52:37.217]  They built these platforms to get us in there like a web so the spiders would have us caught and come up and say, do what we say or we'll not let you talk to people.
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:40.222]  And you go, okay, and they tie her in the web.
[02:52:41.022 --> 02:52:43.524]  And then pretty soon it's like, you can't get free now.
[02:52:44.085 --> 02:52:45.406]  Mmm, delicious.
[02:52:46.326 --> 02:53:01.358]  And that's exactly who Jack Dorsey and all these people are, smart-ass spiders that all screw each other and lie and just, oh yeah, we've got a Bitcoin pump and dump.
[02:53:01.458 --> 02:53:03.340]  I dumped my stock before it plunged.
[02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:08.803]  Now I'm gonna sucker you back in for square cash.
[02:53:09.483 --> 02:53:11.704]  And Joe Rogan's gonna help me.
[02:53:12.545 --> 02:53:14.306]  So get ready for that.
[02:53:16.167 --> 02:53:17.488]  That's how the spider operates.
[02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:20.409]  You gotta learn to recognize the spider.
[02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:22.150]  It's in love with itself.
[02:53:23.892 --> 02:53:25.232]  It's, it's, it's fallen.
[02:53:27.173 --> 02:53:28.674]  And it's so sure of itself.
[02:53:29.715 --> 02:53:31.336]  And how it can destroy everything around it.
[02:53:32.961 --> 02:53:34.842]  But we're here to say no.
[02:53:35.602 --> 02:53:39.505]  So the planet isn't about being a billionaire like Jack Dorsey.
[02:53:39.585 --> 02:53:41.746]  It's about making the right decisions.
[02:53:43.327 --> 02:53:45.548]  And then wealth comes as a secondary thing.
[02:53:45.908 --> 02:53:46.468]  It's unlimited.
[02:53:47.749 --> 02:53:50.190]  But that's why they struggle and they strive.
[02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:52.411]  Well, let's take Jones's funding away.
[02:53:52.472 --> 02:53:53.552]  He'll give up.
[02:53:54.112 --> 02:53:55.053]  Or let's try this and that.
[02:53:55.073 --> 02:54:01.997]  But then there's still so much freedom in the world, so much free will, so much of America left to their rage.
[02:54:03.072 --> 02:54:04.193]  They can't control it all.
[02:54:05.553 --> 02:54:12.236]  And that's why, that's why this is an epic journey.
[02:54:12.276 --> 02:54:13.657]  This is an incredible experiment.
[02:54:13.677 --> 02:54:14.978]  We're all in together.
[02:54:16.398 --> 02:54:26.623]  Because if you support us by word of mouth and by prayer and by financial support, you're stepping in.
[02:54:26.643 --> 02:54:29.465]  I mean, you're not like on the sidelines of the fight over here.
[02:54:30.145 --> 02:54:31.506]  When you support InfoWars,
[02:54:32.435 --> 02:54:47.696]  When you buy our products, when you spread the word, when you pray for us, you are metaphysically, dimensionally, spiritually teleported to the very front line of the fight.
[02:54:47.876 --> 02:54:48.838]  It's in this world.
[02:54:50.362 --> 02:54:53.844]  of currency and credit and funds and commerce.
[02:54:53.924 --> 02:54:56.526]  They've used commerce to get control of us and enslave us.
[02:54:57.066 --> 02:55:00.328]  But what if we use commerce to take back control?
[02:55:01.789 --> 02:55:02.489]  And that's what's happening.
[02:55:03.350 --> 02:55:07.632]  And so, I'm not a knowledge of evil guy.
[02:55:07.652 --> 02:55:08.533]  I'm a knowledge of good guy.
[02:55:10.011 --> 02:55:14.492]  But I've studied the knowledge of evil to understand how they operate, and I've gotten some understanding of it.
[02:55:15.352 --> 02:55:21.834]  And everything they do makes you weaker, makes you dumber, makes you more crippled under their control.
[02:55:22.094 --> 02:55:30.916]  Everything God does makes you stronger, makes you better, makes you purer, makes you more loving, but also commits you to fight evil.
[02:55:31.596 --> 02:55:32.836]  So the two things don't go together.
[02:55:34.257 --> 02:55:35.937]  And so when I sit here and I tell you that
[02:55:37.754 --> 02:55:46.444]  Infowars has been chosen out of the spectrum of resistance because it's one of the leading lights.
[02:55:47.946 --> 02:55:49.508]  And the spiders don't like light.
[02:55:49.728 --> 02:55:50.329]  They like dark.
[02:55:52.812 --> 02:55:57.257]  And so if they're able, they believe, to shut us down.
[02:55:58.618 --> 02:56:03.921]  They believe they've killed a major nexus point for human expression and human freedom.
[02:56:04.922 --> 02:56:11.405]  I have different views on it, and I've learned to say certain things on air because you need to hear it, and other things the enemy knows I tell the truth.
[02:56:11.505 --> 02:56:14.647]  So they'll use things I say against this because they know.
[02:56:14.667 --> 02:56:16.968]  Because they're also blind to a lot of stuff.
[02:56:16.988 --> 02:56:19.030]  They can't see into other realms.
[02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:26.654]  They just are here temporarily trying to dominate and hurt people, and their God says hurt children and be evil, so they do it, so they move up the hierarchy of evil.
[02:56:27.799 --> 02:56:34.821]  But there's a major plan, and the Lord works in mysterious ways, but I can tell you this.
[02:56:35.321 --> 02:56:54.587]  The fact that we're persecuted shows we're over the target, and we just have to hold on a few more years into the future for things we're going to do that don't just give us the big victories you've already delivered, by supporting us, we're all in this together, but to even bigger victories that make
[02:56:58.004 --> 02:56:58.605]  Was you mad?
[02:56:58.645 --> 02:57:00.247]  He's got to go through a lot easier.
[02:57:00.327 --> 02:57:05.933]  It's still gonna be really, really rough, but God doesn't cheat because God has free will, gives us free will.
[02:57:05.953 --> 02:57:10.759]  But you know, there's kind of a little bit of a cheat sheet here, and I realize that's the commitment.
[02:57:10.839 --> 02:57:13.582]  If I'm willing to go all the way, and if you're willing to go all the way,
[02:57:15.003 --> 02:57:26.431]  There's going to be major dividends for our children and for society and culture where, you know, only a billion people are going to die in this Armageddon instead of like seven billion.
[02:57:26.451 --> 02:57:28.593]  I mean, seriously, like, it's kind of choose your adventure.
[02:57:29.373 --> 02:57:36.938]  If we really get involved now and say no to all this up front, then we're going to go through this metamorphosis and it's going to be rough, but it'll be OK.
[02:57:37.879 --> 02:57:42.907]  If we don't, I tell you, it's a very, very hard road we're going down.
[02:57:43.548 --> 02:57:47.834]  And so, I would just ask everybody to really search their heart and soul and commit to this fight.
[02:57:47.954 --> 02:57:49.196]  Thank you all for your financial support.
[02:57:49.457 --> 02:57:50.358]  That's beyond critical.

[02:59:04.047 --> 02:59:06.128]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[02:59:08.689 --> 02:59:10.289]  When we mourn and pray.
[02:59:13.310 --> 02:59:14.851]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:24.372]  When our nation is threatened, there's someone to gather the facts.
[02:59:25.172 --> 02:59:26.173]  To bring you the story.
[02:59:28.855 --> 02:59:29.936]  No matter the cost.
[02:59:32.438 --> 02:59:35.820]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[02:59:36.281 --> 02:59:38.042]  Because knowing empowers us.
[02:59:39.783 --> 02:59:41.485]  Knowing helps us decide.
[02:59:43.026 --> 02:59:45.268]  Knowing keeps us free.
[02:59:57.111 --> 03:00:00.757]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:29.961 --> 03:00:31.824]  Something special about the American flag.
[03:00:33.768 --> 03:00:38.236]  Martha Washington.
[03:00:38.256 --> 03:00:39.077]  Something special.
[03:00:40.900 --> 03:00:41.221]  So.
[03:00:45.199 --> 03:00:49.442]  Let's look at some 20-year-old news here that's finally breaking the last few days.
[03:00:50.403 --> 03:00:57.948]  Aborted baby parts fused with mice to humanize them for grim Frankenstein experiments in U.S.
[03:00:58.008 --> 03:00:58.308]  labs.
[03:00:58.368 --> 03:01:02.170]  As you read about what they're admittedly doing here, is they're creating chimeras.
[03:01:02.211 --> 03:01:04.052]  But they go, oh, it's parts of babies.
[03:01:04.472 --> 03:01:07.174]  Yeah, their DNA is being injected into the mice.
[03:01:09.375 --> 03:01:11.277]  And their growth hormone to create mutations.
[03:01:13.319 --> 03:01:17.061]  Let's move back to stuff that gets people's attention.
[03:01:18.202 --> 03:01:25.706]  New bill would require gun buyers to reveal social media history.
[03:01:26.207 --> 03:01:29.169]  So now you're guilty until proven innocent.
[03:01:30.009 --> 03:01:41.276]  And when you go to buy a gun in Illinois, they want to have a special political board make you under penalty of perjury.
[03:01:42.754 --> 03:01:44.455]  Give them your whole history.
[03:01:45.655 --> 03:01:46.735]  That's called discovery.
[03:01:49.596 --> 03:01:52.517]  That means you've been indicted, or you've been sued.
[03:01:53.197 --> 03:01:56.978]  So this is, the headline should be, gun owners in Illinois to all be sued.
[03:01:58.078 --> 03:02:01.279]  And to be told to give their social history for wit shots.
[03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:06.421]  But see, Chicago CBS Television doesn't put it like that, does it?
[03:02:08.911 --> 03:02:17.181]  Oh, they're like, before Nicholas Cruz killed 17 people at Florida's Parkland High School, he went online and said he was planning to do it.
[03:02:17.541 --> 03:02:20.765]  Yeah, the whole school called him a school shooter.
[03:02:24.619 --> 03:02:27.060]  The whole school called, but he wasn't in school doing it.
[03:02:27.441 --> 03:02:38.486]  And there was this liberal program in Florida, I forget the name, where, well, his last name was Hispanic, so since he was a minority, even though he wasn't Hispanic, he didn't get sent to jail for the robberies and the vandalism and everything.
[03:02:38.526 --> 03:02:45.250]  So, and then the police stood down as well, which is now confirmed, which we first broke, but that's okay, see?
[03:02:45.930 --> 03:02:51.934]  It's all about, well, if Nick Cruz, high school dropout,
[03:02:52.970 --> 03:02:59.214]  Who said he was going to kill everybody for years and was under weird psychiatric care of leftists.
[03:03:02.997 --> 03:03:09.221]  You now need to go prove you're not a bad person and show all your social media because of what Cruz did.
[03:03:12.203 --> 03:03:13.383]  What an incredible announcement.
[03:03:15.165 --> 03:03:21.529]  So the real headline is gun owners new law new law
[03:03:22.671 --> 03:03:25.835]  Would make gun owners give up their social media history.
[03:03:27.277 --> 03:03:28.559]  An anti-gun witch hunt.
[03:03:28.699 --> 03:03:30.361]  I mean, it's here.
[03:03:35.588 --> 03:03:37.411]  Even the ACLU's against it.
[03:03:39.841 --> 03:03:42.242]  They say, how does this list get used?
[03:03:42.282 --> 03:03:47.965]  How do you make people, when they go to get a gun, like come in and say, here's my social history.
[03:03:48.865 --> 03:03:51.466]  And I, you see, you're making yourself a criminal.
[03:03:51.967 --> 03:03:57.269]  Like, oh, you don't want to take dangerous, unapproved vaccines.
[03:03:57.309 --> 03:03:58.189]  No vaccines are approved.
[03:03:58.209 --> 03:04:07.974]  They're all under emergency edicts while there's an emergency governmental system run by, um, the former head of the Justice Department sister.
[03:04:10.922 --> 03:04:21.906]  Rosenstein, that you just are now inducted into some weird star chamber off what you ever did online, and you can't have guns.
[03:04:23.347 --> 03:04:24.608]  It's the end of due process, folks.
[03:04:24.648 --> 03:04:25.588]  They've launched their attack.
[03:04:25.668 --> 03:04:30.810]  The Democrats have just bred giant generations of tens of millions of lawyers, and they're attacking the country.
[03:04:34.011 --> 03:04:39.474]  And it goes on here to say, they want your email, they want your Facebook, they want your YouTube.
[03:04:41.789 --> 03:04:46.332]  And it goes on to say, the National Rifle Association opposes it, and so does the ACLU.
[03:04:47.172 --> 03:04:47.993]  God Almighty.
[03:04:48.093 --> 03:04:51.755]  I mean, this is lunatic asylum stuff, man.
[03:04:52.475 --> 03:04:55.197]  This is unbelievable.
[03:04:55.217 --> 03:04:58.058]  All right, we got the Hackmans taking over.
[03:04:58.099 --> 03:04:59.139]  They're always loaded for bear.
[03:04:59.239 --> 03:05:00.340]  The War Room, come up in an hour.
[03:05:00.740 --> 03:05:01.661]  Infowars.com.

[03:06:19.735 --> 03:06:21.517]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.739 --> 03:06:29.501]  Alright, the Hagmans, two great investigators, co-host father and son, are about to take over in mere minutes.
[03:06:30.322 --> 03:06:41.287]  But I just thought I would go back to the CBS News report out of Illinois, where bills have been introduced by the Democratic Statehouse, they say have the votes, to make you induct yourself into discovery.
[03:06:41.307 --> 03:06:47.711]  It's a new form of law, it's outside of jurisprudence, to give them, under penalty of perjury, all of your social media.
[03:06:48.331 --> 03:07:02.002]  Going back five years, Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, and deliver it to them and then say you've done nothing wrong under penalty of perjury, which then the leftist lawyers wind through to find something you said they don't like to SWAT team you and take your guns.
[03:07:03.784 --> 03:07:04.564]  That's tyranny.
[03:07:05.685 --> 03:07:11.270]  And that's how they use the social networks and the internet for this great purge that's happening.
[03:07:12.489 --> 03:07:14.491]  And all the incredible things that are going on.
[03:07:14.872 --> 03:07:27.346]  Our own news director for the Nightly News, now the overall news programs, Rob Duke, got banned or restricted on three accounts he has on Twitter for simply saying
[03:07:28.615 --> 03:07:32.978]  To someone saying, oh, cops kill more black people than anybody else.
[03:07:33.378 --> 03:07:35.259]  He sent him a statistic saying that's not true.
[03:07:35.279 --> 03:07:40.162]  He was given a strike and told we may ban you, delete this.
[03:07:41.082 --> 03:07:42.864]  That story's coming up on Infowars.com.
[03:07:42.904 --> 03:07:44.905]  This is reaching insane
[03:07:46.644 --> 03:07:47.945]  Levels, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:07:47.985 --> 03:07:51.246]  This, this is what's happening and it's just happening to everyone.
[03:07:51.286 --> 03:07:54.028]  So I'm going to say this again, because I bitch at myself.
[03:07:54.068 --> 03:07:57.870]  You know, I say we could expand, we could fight back, we could win if I plugged more.
[03:07:58.170 --> 03:08:00.351]  Because I get so focused on news, I plug like one time an hour.
[03:08:03.226 --> 03:08:03.646]  It's simple.
[03:08:03.706 --> 03:08:10.088]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[03:08:10.788 --> 03:08:13.029]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[03:08:13.749 --> 03:08:17.130]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all the great it is.
[03:08:17.810 --> 03:08:20.411]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[03:08:21.031 --> 03:08:22.071]  What is the top tumor?
[03:08:22.091 --> 03:08:26.433]  It's a bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory and anti, you know, all that stuff.
[03:08:27.913 --> 03:08:29.474]  What's the best lab in the country?
[03:08:29.554 --> 03:08:30.474]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[03:08:31.431 --> 03:08:33.272]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[03:08:33.632 --> 03:08:37.155]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[03:08:37.835 --> 03:08:40.597]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[03:08:41.057 --> 03:08:41.117]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[03:08:41.437 --> 03:08:43.499]  No one's ever done that.
[03:08:43.519 --> 03:08:45.500]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[03:08:45.540 --> 03:08:46.080]  It costs $10.
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:48.041]  No one's ever done that.
[03:08:48.121 --> 03:08:52.044]  Like, you're not going to, like the, sir, the average competitor's 3 to 5%.
[03:08:52.084 --> 03:08:54.205]  You're like, the top brand's 50%.
[03:08:54.285 --> 03:08:54.445]  I'm like,
[03:08:55.566 --> 03:08:58.047]  We're gonna have 95% curcuminoid.
[03:08:58.487 --> 03:09:02.228]  That's... I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.849]  Our fish oil.
[03:09:04.909 --> 03:09:07.130]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[03:09:07.370 --> 03:09:08.210]  My children take it.
[03:09:08.430 --> 03:09:12.512]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[03:09:12.932 --> 03:09:15.733]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[03:09:16.593 --> 03:09:16.953]  Never!
[03:09:18.574 --> 03:09:22.315]  And that's why they attack me constantly, because they know I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:09:22.375 --> 03:09:24.176]  In fact, that's just the golden rule.
[03:09:25.365 --> 03:09:27.069]  As do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[03:09:27.089 --> 03:09:30.196]  But you know what Christ said is, lay down your life for your brother.
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:33.342]  And I finally figured out what that meant.
[03:09:34.782 --> 03:09:36.743]  God talked about the little children that suffer.
[03:09:37.003 --> 03:09:39.505]  That means people low IQ, children, whatever.
[03:09:40.305 --> 03:09:43.727]  It's up to us that have high IQs to pave the way for them.
[03:09:43.747 --> 03:09:45.488]  And it's up for us to lay down.
[03:09:46.869 --> 03:09:47.469]  It's a mission.
[03:09:47.529 --> 03:09:53.513]  It's not like... It's God saying, you better lay it down for people that aren't as strong as you, or I don't know who you are.
[03:09:53.793 --> 03:09:56.134]  Because God couldn't be hypocrite.
[03:09:56.434 --> 03:10:00.477]  God had to come down to this planet and literally get tortured
[03:10:01.437 --> 03:10:02.278]  Unbelievably bad.
[03:10:02.358 --> 03:10:09.143]  Even though God was God, God had taken on a human body, and the Garden of Gethsemane started crying, saying, because God could see what was going to happen.
[03:10:09.163 --> 03:10:09.883]  He was omnipresent.
[03:10:10.263 --> 03:10:11.624]  He's like, this is going to really hurt.
[03:10:11.644 --> 03:10:15.407]  That's heavy, isn't it?
[03:10:17.348 --> 03:10:19.129]  But God did it, and it was worse than this.
[03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:29.577]  Once God had conquered this dimension, and proven that as incredible as God is, that God can make himself that small, then God went lower into hell.
[03:10:30.586 --> 03:10:32.106]  And got the keys to death and hell.
[03:10:33.547 --> 03:10:34.387]  You think about that.
[03:10:35.527 --> 03:10:37.627]  You think about what Jesus Christ did for us.
[03:10:38.087 --> 03:10:44.068]  And we can't even stand up for unborn babies and get censored or get attacked or have some leftist dump coffee on us?
[03:10:44.088 --> 03:10:44.949]  Give me a break!
[03:10:45.149 --> 03:10:47.209]  I'm a wimp compared to Jesus Christ.
[03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:48.189]  I'm a joke!
[03:10:48.749 --> 03:10:51.790]  And then I look at all these other men, they're a joke compared to me!
[03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:53.090]  And that's pathetic!
[03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:56.971]  Because you're giving up your birthright when you don't stand up against evil.
[03:10:57.451 --> 03:10:58.191]  So I'll tell you again.
[03:10:58.891 --> 03:11:00.692]  This is the time to decide which side you're on.
[03:11:01.293 --> 03:11:02.294]  We need your word of mouth.
[03:11:02.414 --> 03:11:03.194]  We need your prayers.
[03:11:03.214 --> 03:11:04.195]  We need your financial support.
[03:11:04.415 --> 03:11:06.517]  And we're selling products that are the best out there, and we need it.
[03:11:06.677 --> 03:11:08.738]  And I know you've been doing it, so I want to thank you.
[03:11:08.758 --> 03:11:12.461]  But let me tell you, it's our middle class and poor listeners that are our biggest supporters.
[03:11:13.202 --> 03:11:19.426]  But I know all these rich billionaires and all these other guys that want to fly me around on a jet or meet with me, and they've only got some big plan.
[03:11:19.746 --> 03:11:23.729]  And they always want me to do something they want before I get the money to fund all this.
[03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:26.651]  And that's why Jesus said it's easier for a rich man
[03:11:27.672 --> 03:11:27.812]  I think?
[03:11:49.525 --> 03:11:50.506]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:11:50.546 --> 03:11:52.367]  Got some big sales products everybody needs.
[03:11:52.907 --> 03:11:57.070]  Let's go to the Hagmans here with their great intel and everything they've got to offer and I appreciate them joining us.
[03:11:57.430 --> 03:11:57.890]  God bless you.
[03:11:58.911 --> 03:11:59.391]  Hi Alex.
[03:11:59.651 --> 03:12:01.452]  Thanks for letting us take over.
[03:12:01.492 --> 03:12:05.955]  Thanks for sharing your platform and we've got a great rest of the hour lined up for you.
[03:12:06.816 --> 03:12:13.080]  And you're right folks, we need to support InfoWarsStore, InfoWars.com and of course our home base is HagmanReport.com.
[03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:14.340]  But thanks so much Alex.
[03:12:15.836 --> 03:12:17.337]  A lot to get into, actually, today.
[03:12:18.458 --> 03:12:20.500]  Weekend at the Ginsburg's, apparently.
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:23.223]  The Ruth Bader Ginsburg issue.
[03:12:23.523 --> 03:12:24.604]  Going to be talking about that.
[03:12:24.644 --> 03:12:26.586]  I just want to open up with one thing.
[03:12:27.526 --> 03:12:40.118]  Alex was talking about the unborn and about what we have and haven't done and about the, my goodness, just the incredible immorality, the incredible bloodshed behind this.
[03:12:41.628 --> 03:12:49.711]  Coach Dave Dobmeier, coachdavelive.com, I like to call him America's Coach, wrote just a great article back in 2006, some 13 years ago, and the pulpits are silent.
[03:12:50.012 --> 03:13:00.256]  It's being republished, actually, with a couple of different, a couple of updates before it's news, but we'll have it at hagmanreport.com, and the pulpits are silent.
[03:13:00.796 --> 03:13:06.018]  But the bottom line here is, despite what the political parties want you to believe, the problem in America is not the politicians.
[03:13:06.158 --> 03:13:08.919]  Of course they are a problem, but not the problem.
[03:13:09.979 --> 03:13:13.080]  It's not the politicians, that's not where you're going to find the problems, it's in the pulpits.
[03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:25.004]  And most of America's pulpits today, as Alex Jones was just saying, you know, Jesus was not a cowardly man when he was walking the earth.
[03:13:26.204 --> 03:13:37.488]  And we look at ourselves, and I'll tell you, the cowardice, most of America's pulpits, most, not all, but most are filled with America, with cowardly men.
[03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:40.401]  They are ashamed to the Christ they claim to serve.
[03:13:40.461 --> 03:13:42.201]  This according to Dob Meier.
[03:13:42.502 --> 03:13:44.542]  That's Dave Dob Meier, beforeitsnews.com.
[03:13:45.583 --> 03:13:50.985]  I believe that's where it's published at right now, and it'll be at hagmanreport.com soon, if it's not already there.
[03:13:51.045 --> 03:14:06.150]  But if you think those are harsh words, the cheap grace culture in which we live, the let's go along to get along, let's not really talk about the important issues, let's not talk about the
[03:14:08.641 --> 03:14:08.841]  Thank you.
[03:14:25.424 --> 03:14:32.409]  It's interesting to note that Planned Parenthood paid, listen to this, $6.5 million for a seat at the State of the Union Address.
[03:14:32.969 --> 03:14:36.532]  You don't think that killing of babies and the trafficking of babies is big business?
[03:14:36.952 --> 03:14:40.695]  Yeah, try coming up with $6.5 million for a seat at the State of the Union Address.
[03:14:41.055 --> 03:14:41.815]  Or $6.5 million for anything.
[03:14:43.638 --> 03:14:44.498]  Who gets that payment?
[03:14:45.198 --> 03:14:49.079]  And then you have to buy a ticket to the State of the Union for $6.5 million?
[03:14:49.179 --> 03:14:51.320]  Or is this, this doesn't sound right at all.
[03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:54.101]  Uh, somebody's getting money at the table.
[03:14:54.661 --> 03:14:56.721]  Yeah.
[03:14:56.741 --> 03:14:57.281]  Yeah.
[03:14:59.302 --> 03:15:03.023]  The Washington Examiner, no, the Washington Examiner reported this by Michael Watson today.
[03:15:03.043 --> 03:15:08.704]  In an article today, Washington Examiner, Planned Parenthood paid $6.5 million for a seat at the State of the Union.
[03:15:09.244 --> 03:15:11.885]  What in the hell, first of all, what in the hell are we doing inviting these kind of
[03:15:12.655 --> 03:15:18.638]  These kind of odious people, in my view, immoral, murdering, forgive my language, bastards.
[03:15:19.318 --> 03:15:20.899]  It's right on the money.
[03:15:21.199 --> 03:15:22.839]  I mean, these people pay them for access.
[03:15:22.999 --> 03:15:24.280]  They get kickbacks.
[03:15:24.580 --> 03:15:38.526]  I was reading a story, a much bigger amount of money, I forget the, it was hundreds of millions of dollars that Planned Parenthood had paid or received and then in turn donated to all these different Democratic congressmen and governor, gubernatorial candidates and Senate candidates.
[03:15:39.006 --> 03:15:42.107]  And then when they get in power, you know, the money flows back to them.
[03:15:42.147 --> 03:15:48.068]  So it's a big, you know, circle of corruption where money's being, taxpayer money's being handed to these organizations.
[03:15:48.088 --> 03:15:53.749]  They're in turn handing it to the corrupt politicians for all these different things and laws to be passed in their favor.
[03:15:54.109 --> 03:15:56.050]  And it is just corruption to its core.
[03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:57.330]  Let me stop you there.
[03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:58.470]  Yep, go ahead.
[03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:58.910]  Take us out.
[03:15:59.610 --> 03:16:00.951]  When we come back, we'll hit on this.
[03:16:01.011 --> 03:16:01.911]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg and more.
[03:16:01.931 --> 03:16:02.411]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:02.978 --> 03:16:15.269]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:16:16.390 --> 03:16:27.441]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:16:28.729 --> 03:16:30.373]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:16:30.653 --> 03:16:33.319]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:16:34.684 --> 03:16:38.487]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:16:39.027 --> 03:16:45.311]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:16:45.571 --> 03:16:47.052]  This country is in a war!
[03:16:47.873 --> 03:16:57.940]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.

[03:20:25.092 --> 03:20:30.802]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Doug Hagman.
[03:20:36.832 --> 03:20:37.633]  Hey, welcome back.
[03:20:38.193 --> 03:20:40.976]  InfoWars, InfoWars.com, this fourth hour.
[03:20:41.036 --> 03:20:43.538]  InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:43.578 --> 03:20:52.247]  I gotta tell you, you know, some of the products there, the nutritional supplements, you don't think maybe that they can make a difference?
[03:20:52.387 --> 03:20:53.007]  Oh, they do.
[03:20:53.508 --> 03:20:54.168]  Oh, they do.
[03:20:54.249 --> 03:20:56.951]  In fact, I can see through people, okay?
[03:20:57.692 --> 03:21:00.835]  I'm kidding, of course, but for example, Brain Force Plus and
[03:21:01.335 --> 03:21:02.476]  All of the other products, folks.
[03:21:02.696 --> 03:21:03.757]  Support the movement.

[03:21:15.087 --> 03:21:21.272]  I'm sure you're a guy, if you're a woman listening to this, or even for yourself, look, the products work.
[03:21:21.353 --> 03:21:25.196]  And we're at a time right now where we need to be mentally sharp, physically fit.
[03:21:25.802 --> 03:21:27.684]  Because we're in a fight, we're in a fight of our lives.
[03:21:27.804 --> 03:21:29.625]  And that's not a sales pitch, that's just the way it is.
[03:21:30.085 --> 03:21:34.949]  Before the break, we're talking about, and Joe, by the way, Joe is with me, our home base is Hagman.
[03:21:34.989 --> 03:21:35.510]  Did I say this?
[03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:40.013]  HagmanReportLive, HagmanReport.com and HagmanReportLive.com.
[03:21:40.033 --> 03:21:42.615]  HagmanReport.com and HagmanReportLive.com.
[03:21:42.635 --> 03:21:43.736]  Two N's on Hagman, by the way.
[03:21:44.817 --> 03:21:46.718]  And we broadcast Monday through Friday.
[03:21:48.092 --> 03:21:48.212]  It's
[03:22:05.584 --> 03:22:07.825]  They're boots on to the throats of the patriots.
[03:22:08.566 --> 03:22:10.747]  They're growing, we're growing, we're all growing together.
[03:22:10.767 --> 03:22:13.588]  And the globalists, they can't stand it.
[03:22:13.968 --> 03:22:14.589]  And you can see it.
[03:22:15.829 --> 03:22:17.350]  People are coming unglued on Twitter.
[03:22:17.370 --> 03:22:19.051]  They're coming unglued on social networking.
[03:22:19.451 --> 03:22:20.292]  And I love it.
[03:22:20.472 --> 03:22:22.393]  I love to see those people coming unglued.
[03:22:22.853 --> 03:22:25.294]  It's about time that they're the ones.
[03:22:25.614 --> 03:22:29.276]  It's about time to see them squirm and to say, God, we can't be exposed.
[03:22:29.376 --> 03:22:30.016]  Oh my God!
[03:22:30.777 --> 03:22:32.097]  So we got to shut up Alex Jones.
[03:22:32.117 --> 03:22:33.238]  We got to shut up Haggis.
[03:22:33.258 --> 03:22:34.479]  We got to shut up.
[03:22:34.539 --> 03:22:35.039]  But you know what?
[03:22:35.709 --> 03:22:36.430]  We will prevail.
[03:22:36.570 --> 03:22:37.670]  In the end, we will prevail.
[03:22:37.710 --> 03:22:38.811]  Of course, we know how it all turns out.
[03:22:38.831 --> 03:22:41.193]  But anyway, right before the break, we're talking about Planned Parenthood.
[03:22:41.813 --> 03:22:44.395]  In my view, in my personal opinion, Planned Butcherhood.
[03:22:45.215 --> 03:22:46.596]  Just very quickly to wrap this up.
[03:22:47.257 --> 03:22:50.579]  In total, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood votes
[03:22:51.155 --> 03:22:52.096]  It's more than that.
[03:23:10.638 --> 03:23:11.678]  It's more than that.
[03:23:11.859 --> 03:23:15.180]  It is 30 million dollars from reports.
[03:23:15.380 --> 03:23:15.800]  Big plan.
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:19.442]  This is from Snopes and I love how... I love Snopes.
[03:23:19.482 --> 03:23:20.202]  Don't take me wrong.
[03:23:20.522 --> 03:23:39.030]  I love it because of how inaccurate... I love it because of the liberal insanity bias that they have and their ability to think that they can change facts and change people's statements, what they say, to twist them to make their claims true or false or whatever the agenda that they're trying to push.
[03:23:39.090 --> 03:23:39.970]  Obviously it's always the
[03:23:40.610 --> 03:23:43.631]  Socialist, communist agenda, but this is an article from Snopes.
[03:23:43.651 --> 03:23:47.273]  Did Planned Parenthood donate $30 million to Democrats to influence the midterm election?
[03:23:47.293 --> 03:23:48.093]  Well, what did Snopes say?
[03:23:48.113 --> 03:23:50.014]  They said it's a mixture of true or false.
[03:23:50.074 --> 03:23:50.494]  What's true?
[03:23:50.575 --> 03:23:51.415]  Planned Parenthood votes...
[03:23:52.089 --> 03:24:02.012]  Is one member of a coalition of organizations which is planning on extending or to expend 30 million to mobilize infrequent voters in the midterm elections.
[03:24:02.492 --> 03:24:05.413]  And they say that this is not Planned Parenthood per se.
[03:24:05.453 --> 03:24:06.873]  It's an offshoot of Planned Parenthood.
[03:24:06.893 --> 03:24:07.653]  So what's not true?
[03:24:07.953 --> 03:24:09.754]  It's not actually Planned Parenthood.
[03:24:09.814 --> 03:24:10.874]  It's separate from the organization.
[03:24:10.914 --> 03:24:15.175]  But it's the same organization, the same organization at the very top.
[03:24:15.475 --> 03:24:16.936]  And then I have a few other things here.
[03:24:17.356 --> 03:24:19.216]  Planned Parenthood in recent elections.
[03:24:19.736 --> 03:24:21.077]  Think of what happened in Virginia.
[03:24:21.097 --> 03:24:21.517]  The governor
[03:24:21.997 --> 03:24:22.918]  We're good to go.
[03:24:39.878 --> 03:24:39.938]  Yes.
[03:24:58.420 --> 03:24:58.700]  I think?
[03:25:16.750 --> 03:25:29.135]  But not only that, pushing the infanticide issue, execution of babies after they've been born by the mother, and after they have survived abortions, wanting to kill them again, or try to kill them again.
[03:25:29.535 --> 03:25:33.717]  So is there any relationship between Planned Parenthood money, which is essentially
[03:25:35.922 --> 03:25:45.104]  Going to these candidates who then turn around and get these laws implemented in their states, which take the infanticide issue now, and they're taking it to the extreme.
[03:25:45.724 --> 03:26:03.568]  I can't wrap my mind around how this is even legal, but this is what we're seeing, and what we see with this infanticide and abortion issue is it went from the Bill Clinton years, Planned Parenthood said, you know, was pushing in the left wing, Bill Clinton was pushing to have abortions much more easily accessible for women who were in health risks,
[03:26:04.368 --> 03:26:07.690]  They said they didn't want to use it, except for certain parameters.
[03:26:07.770 --> 03:26:17.474]  If the woman was in danger of losing her life in the pregnancy, or there was going to be some very serious complications from that pregnancy.
[03:26:17.534 --> 03:26:30.479]  Now, we went from that in the 1990s to what, 20-30 years later, they are celebrating not only abortion but infanticide in the streets, in the media, in Hollywood, and it's only going to get worse from there because who's next after the baby?
[03:26:32.169 --> 03:26:33.671]  And let me just say this, alright?
[03:26:34.031 --> 03:26:35.753]  Look, I understand the blackface stuff.
[03:26:35.833 --> 03:26:36.353]  I get that.
[03:26:36.714 --> 03:26:39.456]  I understand the racial insensitivity.
[03:26:39.476 --> 03:26:43.040]  Okay, but aside from that, what should we be talking about?
[03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:43.881]  What's more important?
[03:26:43.921 --> 03:26:46.103]  Is it the racial aspect of this?
[03:26:46.503 --> 03:26:56.373]  Or is it the fact that the very person accused of the racial insensitivities is the one that's promoting this infanticide, this baby murder?
[03:26:57.073 --> 03:27:15.922]  And becoming enriched, whether it's via the campaign, in my view, or personally through PACs and what have you, and campaign funds, people who know how that works understand that there is a level of enrichment there that does occur in the process.
[03:27:15.942 --> 03:27:19.104]  You've got to be absolutely the moron not to understand it.
[03:27:19.719 --> 03:27:31.984]  But the fact is, look, this is all happening, and this is happening on the backs, and people don't understand the aspect that Barack Hussein Obama played into this infanticide.
[03:27:32.004 --> 03:27:34.285]  I'm not even going to use the word abortion anymore, it's infanticide.
[03:27:34.665 --> 03:27:45.130]  Because the infanticidal Democrats took their cues from Barack Obama, this and a piece from American Thinker Today, as well by Trevor Thomas, and when you look back, you know, for decades,
[03:27:46.674 --> 03:27:57.604]  Democrats have dehumanized, deliberately dehumanized the unborn and argued against protecting the most innocent and helpless among us, even when they escaped death in their mother's wombs.
[03:27:58.164 --> 03:28:01.908]  And in order to further their wicked sexual agenda, which is attached to this,
[03:28:02.535 --> 03:28:04.817]  So you've got the wicked sexual agenda.
[03:28:05.257 --> 03:28:09.340]  Think back to the counterculture culture of the 60s and how that impacted American morality.
[03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:17.025]  And you even go back further into the eugenics and then go a step later now and look at what's happening on the other side of the coin.
[03:28:17.305 --> 03:28:32.155]  In addition to infanticide, you're looking at not post-birth abortions, although that's definitely part of it, but also what's going on with these comfort choices about, oh, aid and comfort to expedite the terminally ill and the infirm.
[03:28:32.435 --> 03:28:33.716]  We're good to go.
[03:29:02.813 --> 03:29:07.755]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[03:29:08.976 --> 03:29:13.958]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[03:29:14.899 --> 03:29:15.759]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:16.499 --> 03:29:16.979]  We stopped her.
[03:29:17.019 --> 03:29:17.920]  We got a nationalist in.
[03:29:19.180 --> 03:29:21.261]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[03:29:21.401 --> 03:29:22.302]  We are winning.
[03:29:23.291 --> 03:29:28.197]  Those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[03:29:28.657 --> 03:29:33.723]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of a treasure.
[03:29:33.763 --> 03:29:34.884]  This is about who wants it most.
[03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:39.401]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.

[03:29:40.621 --> 03:29:41.341]  You are in my hands.

[03:31:54.237 --> 03:31:56.017]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:31:56.097 --> 03:31:59.859]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:32:14.745 --> 03:32:17.946]  I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[03:32:19.186 --> 03:32:21.386]  And that would be a very true statement.
[03:32:21.406 --> 03:32:27.547]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[03:32:28.608 --> 03:32:33.548]  If I fight as hard as I can, and people don't support us, we shut down in a year.

[03:32:42.765 --> 03:32:50.970]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:32:51.370 --> 03:32:55.552]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[03:32:56.112 --> 03:32:58.854]  We're proud of what we brought you and the whole family of InfoWars products.
[03:32:59.314 --> 03:33:00.515]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:33:07.038 --> 03:33:09.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.121 --> 03:33:18.726]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.786 --> 03:33:20.228]  And now, your host, Doug Hagman.
[03:33:34.494 --> 03:33:39.035]  Man, this is the InfoWars.com InfoWars Show.
[03:33:39.075 --> 03:33:42.817]  Doug Eggman and Joe Eggman sitting in for Alex Jones, of course, in the fourth hour here.
[03:33:45.698 --> 03:33:47.858]  Do you remember Antonio Scalia?
[03:33:48.638 --> 03:33:53.440]  Obviously, as the Supreme Court Justice who passed away, allegedly, on a ranch.
[03:33:54.300 --> 03:33:55.781]  Unattended death.
[03:33:56.561 --> 03:33:56.741]  Right.
[03:33:56.941 --> 03:33:58.501]  Unattended death, obviously.
[03:33:58.521 --> 03:34:00.062]  This was an unattended death.
[03:34:00.877 --> 03:34:13.106]  And look, in my capacity, professionally, I've seen unattended deaths and handled things, and there's a protocol that you adhere to for unattended deaths.
[03:34:14.187 --> 03:34:20.311]  Well, you know, initially I looked at that and I thought, well, okay, things weren't followed exactly 100%.
[03:34:21.151 --> 03:34:24.854]  I could see where maybe things might have just slipped through the cracks or whatever.
[03:34:25.434 --> 03:34:29.097]  But then again, I thought, okay, wait, this is a Supreme Court justice.
[03:34:29.137 --> 03:34:30.238]  You don't want any kind of
[03:34:30.962 --> 03:34:38.244]  You know, you don't want anything to be, believe me, there's a lot, I gotta tell you, there's a lot of people, a lot of paperwork in unattended deaths, okay?
[03:34:38.844 --> 03:34:46.166]  A lot of paperwork, and even more in suspicious deaths that are also unattended, but you get the idea.
[03:34:46.186 --> 03:34:49.847]  All right, so here's the bottom line.
[03:34:49.927 --> 03:34:58.790]  I thought, well, maybe those people who were saying that this is really not right, or making something more of it, you know, kind of on the fringe of things.
[03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:59.370]  Okay, now,
[03:35:00.524 --> 03:35:04.966]  That's at the end of, as Joe said, the end of Obama's term, basically, or the time in office.
[03:35:05.167 --> 03:35:10.389]  And you can see how, you can see the impact of the Supreme Court justices have.
[03:35:11.230 --> 03:35:12.390]  But what I'm getting to is this.
[03:35:13.691 --> 03:35:14.571]  I want proof of life.
[03:35:14.691 --> 03:35:17.573]  I want proof of life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:35:18.513 --> 03:35:23.136]  And Joe and I, primarily Joe's done a lot of investigative work on, okay,
[03:35:23.955 --> 03:35:24.656]  Where is she?
[03:35:25.056 --> 03:35:29.941]  And again, for those people looking for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, look, she's not here.
[03:35:30.782 --> 03:35:33.644]  She's not up, you know, in my home, in my guest room.
[03:35:35.927 --> 03:35:44.475]  And I do suspect kind of a, forgive me, but kind of a Norman Bates kind of thing going on here, where maybe somebody will find her in a rocking chair.
[03:35:44.975 --> 03:35:47.738]  And I would suggest if you do,
[03:35:48.726 --> 03:35:53.749]  Just those people looking for carry a little can of Vicks around with you and it always helps underneath the nose.
[03:35:54.509 --> 03:35:57.911]  Little tip from LAO for the LAO community.
[03:35:58.552 --> 03:36:05.656]  But I do wonder at this point if we're not seeing this deep state hiding and for as much as that sounds
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:07.600]  Gruesome, I'll just say this.
[03:36:07.620 --> 03:36:16.984]  Look, we pray, hope and pray that she's on the road to a fast recovery and all that, but you know, don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining out, alright?
[03:36:17.744 --> 03:36:20.825]  Just be honest and just tell me what the deal is.
[03:36:20.945 --> 03:36:28.388]  After all, we have the right to know as American citizens, given her prominence, position of prominence, and we're not getting that.
[03:36:28.408 --> 03:36:29.749]  So, Joe, I'm going to give it to you.
[03:36:33.533 --> 03:36:34.214]  Well, let's do this.
[03:36:34.314 --> 03:36:42.240]  OK, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there was a number of interesting things that have happened from January till just the State of the Union.
[03:36:42.740 --> 03:36:46.263]  And as we all know, in late December, she fell and broke her ribs.
[03:36:46.723 --> 03:36:48.965]  When that happened, they found, I believe it was,
[03:36:49.805 --> 03:36:59.148]  Paul up or two lesions of some kind in her lung, cancerous tumors in her lung that were very small, which she had in operation and had them removed.
[03:36:59.248 --> 03:37:00.928]  And people have not seen her since.
[03:37:00.948 --> 03:37:05.449]  She has not been serving on the bench, leaving many to ask, you know, what's her condition?
[03:37:05.489 --> 03:37:06.570]  There's no public appearances.
[03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:07.570]  There's no proof of life.
[03:37:08.690 --> 03:37:18.813]  The real question is, are they holding her in the back room on ice till 2020 elections when they believe Trump will not be in office and not allowing him to get another Supreme Court pick?
[03:37:19.333 --> 03:37:22.054]  Well, this is the series of events that have happened.
[03:37:22.094 --> 03:37:25.196]  By the way, Hillary Clinton, I just want to put this in there.
[03:37:25.536 --> 03:37:28.857]  Hillary Clinton, not sick either, okay?
[03:37:28.917 --> 03:37:29.998]  Don't believe your lying eyes.
[03:37:30.018 --> 03:37:30.538]  She didn't fall.
[03:37:31.238 --> 03:37:32.178]  No, she didn't fall.
[03:37:32.199 --> 03:37:33.399]  She didn't lose a shoe.
[03:37:33.459 --> 03:37:35.560]  That was just one of those unfortunate things.
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:38.481]  Again, don't believe your lying eyes.
[03:37:38.921 --> 03:37:44.364]  Don't believe what the right or the new media is telling you.
[03:37:44.384 --> 03:37:44.804]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:37:45.224 --> 03:37:47.545]  I just want to make sure people aren't losing their minds.
[03:37:48.482 --> 03:37:51.784]  With Hillary Clinton, even the fact-checkers were saying, oh, no, that's not true.
[03:37:51.824 --> 03:37:52.845]  She didn't collapse.
[03:37:52.885 --> 03:37:54.226]  She didn't fall down.
[03:37:54.266 --> 03:37:54.846]  She wasn't sick.
[03:37:54.886 --> 03:37:55.427]  She was fine.
[03:37:55.707 --> 03:37:58.609]  But Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and there's a footage of her falling right there.
[03:37:58.869 --> 03:38:03.472]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in January, Fox showed a graphic.
[03:38:04.145 --> 03:38:11.728]  And this graphic had a date, I believe it was 1933 to 2019, and it was serving as a memorial.
[03:38:12.008 --> 03:38:13.869]  Pretty much what happens when people pass away.
[03:38:14.209 --> 03:38:17.991]  They put up these little graphics and, you know, in memory of, and they had the date.
[03:38:18.031 --> 03:38:23.833]  So they further issued a retraction or an apology saying, you know, we're sorry we did this on accident.
[03:38:24.093 --> 03:38:24.993]  We're good to go.
[03:38:43.942 --> 03:38:45.463]  There's no reason to show that on TV.
[03:38:46.064 --> 03:38:52.548]  And I can understand somebody pressing the wrong button, but why is that even in the, you know, in circulation of things that could make its way to TV?
[03:38:52.568 --> 03:38:53.229]  That's my question.
[03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:54.730]  But let's put that aside.
[03:38:54.910 --> 03:38:56.971]  Now, Monday, there was an event.
[03:38:57.372 --> 03:39:04.416]  And this event was, I believe, at the National Women's of Arts in D.C.
[03:39:05.517 --> 03:39:06.858]  And I'm not sure that the correct name.
[03:39:06.878 --> 03:39:08.259]  It's a pretty obscure place.
[03:39:08.479 --> 03:39:10.961]  I mean, it was an obscure event, right?
[03:39:11.001 --> 03:39:12.622]  I mean, it wasn't one of these things where
[03:39:13.217 --> 03:39:15.038]  It was a notorious RPG in song.
[03:39:15.118 --> 03:39:25.503]  It was an hour and a half musical, if you will, about her life and about her practice on the Supreme Court.
[03:39:25.543 --> 03:39:30.786]  And this lady was singing about her life, using quotes in cases she ruled on.
[03:39:31.066 --> 03:39:35.769]  But anyway, this is what was reported, that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is making her first public appearance.
[03:39:38.697 --> 03:39:45.121]  This was at a concert at a museum a few blocks from the White House given by her daughter-in-law and other musicians.
[03:39:45.681 --> 03:39:50.424]  Now, the concert is dedicated to Ginsburg's life in the law.
[03:39:50.884 --> 03:40:03.531]  What goes on from here and what is reported from here is very interesting because they say she was sitting in the room, in the very back of the room, and it was darkly lit and it wasn't announced that she was there and nobody saw her.
[03:40:03.571 --> 03:40:04.692]  You weren't allowed to take pictures.
[03:40:05.072 --> 03:40:17.699]  Well, a lot of pictures and video from the actual event itself has been released, and there has been no pictures of her taken at this event, and they also said, as I said, no cameras there.
[03:40:17.919 --> 03:40:28.144]  Other people took pictures of the crowd, and it seemed like a lot of younger people, and I think it was part of a high school was there, and then there were other people who attended, but nonetheless, there was no proof of life, no pictures of her.
[03:40:28.824 --> 03:40:31.546]  And no video of her being anywhere near this place.
[03:40:31.606 --> 03:40:40.592]  And Sebastian Gorka tweeted out the next day saying, I believe that this concert or non-appearance of hers is going to be her excuse to not go to the State of the Union address.
[03:40:40.652 --> 03:40:46.917]  And sure enough, right before that, they announced that she was not going to be present at the State of the Union due to her attendance at this conference.
[03:40:47.437 --> 03:40:53.621]  But during the concert, during the concert, her son-in-law got up there and said that Ruth is fine.
[03:40:53.681 --> 03:40:57.384]  She walks a mile a day and meets with her personal trainer twice a week.
[03:40:58.164 --> 03:40:59.165]  But here's the question.
[03:41:00.045 --> 03:41:09.950]  Basically, I believe TMZ, I believe this still is true, TMZ camping out in front of her house or they have people sitting there waiting for her, you know, to make her appearance, to come out of the house.
[03:41:10.410 --> 03:41:11.711]  We still have not seen that.
[03:41:11.731 --> 03:41:12.792]  You're bouncing on screen, Joe.
[03:41:13.232 --> 03:41:14.393]  You're making viewers seasick, man.
[03:41:14.413 --> 03:41:14.513]  Sorry.
[03:41:20.037 --> 03:41:28.763]  Anyway, the news, Fox News, the AP, to everybody else reported that she attended this conference a few blocks from the White House that was dedicated to her.
[03:41:28.963 --> 03:41:33.866]  There was no mention of this by the people who were hosting or putting on the concert.
[03:41:34.186 --> 03:41:36.547]  There was nothing to say, you know, thank you, she's here.
[03:41:38.008 --> 03:41:40.209]  Nothing like that, which is pretty customary.
[03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:47.894]  You'd think that when a concert is given in the honor and memory of her life in the law, she would be in the front row and it would make it a big deal, you know.
[03:41:48.154 --> 03:41:50.275]  Well, at least one picture.
[03:41:51.496 --> 03:41:51.997]  But you know what?
[03:41:52.197 --> 03:41:53.337]  Here's what I heard.
[03:41:53.437 --> 03:41:55.799]  I heard Norman was talking to her.
[03:41:56.259 --> 03:41:57.360]  Her son, Norman.
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:41:58.841]  I heard Norman was talking to her.
[03:41:59.161 --> 03:42:02.563]  And the rocking chair was going back and forth and back and forth.
[03:42:02.583 --> 03:42:03.364]  And I guarantee you,
[03:42:04.324 --> 03:42:05.665]  Yeah, in the trophy room.
[03:42:05.705 --> 03:42:06.226]  Go ahead, Joe.
[03:42:06.266 --> 03:42:06.746]  I didn't mean that.
[03:42:06.786 --> 03:42:09.349]  I guess that was foretaste, but so what?
[03:42:09.489 --> 03:42:25.324]  One other little aspect of this as we're closing out this segment was an anonymous nurse posted to one of the forums online and stated that, you know, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in a coma somewhere out west, and they put a picture up.
[03:42:25.344 --> 03:42:27.146]  You couldn't make heads or tails of who it was,
[03:42:27.806 --> 03:42:28.247]  I don't know.
[03:42:45.882 --> 03:42:46.362]  I think so.
[03:43:02.912 --> 03:43:10.277]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:43:10.617 --> 03:43:23.766]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:43:23.986 --> 03:43:28.529]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[03:43:28.889 --> 03:43:32.392]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[03:43:33.052 --> 03:43:41.654]  We're gonna go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:42.154 --> 03:43:44.494]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[03:43:44.914 --> 03:43:51.615]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:52.095 --> 03:43:55.036]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[03:43:55.236 --> 03:44:01.737]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:06.531 --> 03:44:10.714]  A rare window with Gateway Pundit reporter Cassandra Fairbanks for articles at gatewaypundit.com.
[03:44:10.834 --> 03:44:16.817]  Julian Assange's living conditions deteriorate, more akin to Stasi-era dissident than an award-winning publisher with asylum.
[03:44:16.837 --> 03:44:19.359]  Then I asked her, I said, why is your article just about how horrible the conditions are?
[03:44:19.899 --> 03:44:23.341]  And she just said, because I can't write about it or say anything.
[03:44:23.902 --> 03:44:28.845]  Nothing about anything he ever did, politics, that he's innocent, that he's not a Russian agent, none of that.
[03:44:29.065 --> 03:44:31.986]  Or they're threatening to, I guess, throw him in the river or something.
[03:44:32.087 --> 03:44:34.148]  Cassandra, this is beyond Kafkaesque.
[03:44:34.228 --> 03:44:36.049]  I mean, to me, I think the guy's a hero.
[03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.950]  No, me too.
[03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:39.652]  I, of course, I'm a huge fan of his.
[03:44:40.032 --> 03:44:43.335]  I have been covering WikiLeaks for a very long time now.
[03:44:44.384 --> 03:44:47.227]  And it was pretty shocking this last visit.
[03:44:47.327 --> 03:44:49.188]  The security hammers are everywhere.
[03:44:49.308 --> 03:44:51.290]  You can't speak anywhere at all.
[03:44:51.831 --> 03:44:56.775]  I mean, the treatment that he's receiving right now, it's worse than being in a federal prison.
[03:44:56.995 --> 03:44:59.897]  So this time when I went, I had to jump through all kinds of hoops.
[03:44:59.937 --> 03:45:02.199]  I had to get a letter from the ambassador clearing me.
[03:45:02.399 --> 03:45:04.081]  I had to give up my social media accounts.
[03:45:04.141 --> 03:45:07.764]  I had to provide the address of the Gateway Pundit, information about my job.
[03:45:08.144 --> 03:45:12.428]  If I wanted to bring my phone in, I would have had to provide the EMEI code.
[03:45:12.648 --> 03:45:13.329]  We're good to go.
[03:45:36.012 --> 03:45:40.676]  We know that the spy agencies have been doing reports on even things like his general mood every day.
[03:45:41.296 --> 03:45:44.238]  So he's basically inside of a real-life Truman Show.
[03:45:45.339 --> 03:45:52.184]  And we attempted to go into another room to get a little bit of privacy because the noise machine wasn't working.
[03:45:53.304 --> 03:45:57.647]  And they came and knocked on the door immediately and they were like, no, you have to go back into this room.
[03:45:57.687 --> 03:45:59.469]  That's basically a fishbowl.
[03:46:00.169 --> 03:46:13.317]  And so we went, we ended up having to go back into the room and we took a little radio to try and, you know, play some white noise and drown out our voices, but it was so bad that we just ended up writing notes back and forth on a notebook.
[03:46:13.517 --> 03:46:20.361]  Of course he told me interesting things while we were passing notes, but if I report any of it, it's gonna put him in danger.
[03:46:20.862 --> 03:46:22.903]  And that's, that's the thing that sucks.
[03:46:23.263 --> 03:46:25.484]  Anybody has the right to defend themselves.
[03:46:25.544 --> 03:46:27.766]  Like, even people who are on death row for murder.
[03:46:28.286 --> 03:46:28.906]  We're good to go.
[03:46:52.196 --> 03:46:54.138]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:25.023 --> 03:47:36.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Doug Hagman.
[03:47:38.978 --> 03:47:45.345]  Doug Hagman, Joe Hagman, HagmanReport.com, sitting in for Alex Jones, our four Info Wars.
[03:47:45.365 --> 03:47:46.245]  I want to thank you for
[03:47:47.305 --> 03:47:50.749]  Thank you for joining us and thank you for keeping this on.
[03:47:51.270 --> 03:47:56.436]  Thank you, everyone, for supporting InfoWars.com and for supporting InfoWars store.
[03:47:56.456 --> 03:47:57.217]  Get your products there.
[03:47:57.237 --> 03:47:57.977]  You're going to feel better.
[03:47:58.037 --> 03:48:00.881]  Mental acuity, physical health, a lot better.
[03:48:00.921 --> 03:48:01.722]  This stuff is great.
[03:48:02.582 --> 03:48:05.565]  Do your shopping there and do yourself a favor.
[03:48:05.625 --> 03:48:08.207]  Make yourself feel better and get more physically fit.
[03:48:08.307 --> 03:48:10.108]  The bone broth, of course, the brain force.
[03:48:10.488 --> 03:48:11.749]  It's all good stuff.
[03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:14.651]  So you know what to do, folks.
[03:48:14.671 --> 03:48:16.713]  You've got to support this movement.
[03:48:17.113 --> 03:48:18.774]  It's more than a product.
[03:48:18.854 --> 03:48:19.815]  It's more than a show.
[03:48:19.915 --> 03:48:20.716]  It's a movement.
[03:48:20.796 --> 03:48:26.960]  And we are winning despite what the intellectually deficient morons on the left claim.
[03:48:27.521 --> 03:48:30.463]  We are winning the information war and they can't stand that.
[03:48:31.375 --> 03:48:32.696]  Is with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:48:32.856 --> 03:48:33.916]  They got nothing to say.
[03:48:34.076 --> 03:48:35.277]  Ain't got nothing to say.
[03:48:35.597 --> 03:48:36.277]  Cause she's what?
[03:48:36.337 --> 03:48:37.617]  Maybe rocking in the chair.
[03:48:37.958 --> 03:48:39.078]  And Norman's talking to her.
[03:48:39.158 --> 03:48:39.638]  I don't know.
[03:48:40.318 --> 03:48:40.979]  Let me finish.
[03:48:41.019 --> 03:48:41.259]  Wait.
[03:48:41.739 --> 03:48:41.899]  Yeah.
[03:48:41.999 --> 03:48:42.239]  Okay.
[03:48:42.259 --> 03:48:42.559]  Go ahead.
[03:48:42.579 --> 03:48:43.660]  Cause I do want to get into it.
[03:48:43.700 --> 03:48:44.560]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:50.362]  Stone, stone, stone cold, uh, stone cold, uh, um, uh, spying.
[03:48:50.522 --> 03:48:51.723]  I want to get into that, but go ahead.
[03:48:51.743 --> 03:48:52.103]  Okay.
[03:48:52.123 --> 03:48:53.163]  Let's finish with Ruth Bader.
[03:48:53.443 --> 03:48:57.685]  So the Gateway Pundit on February 5th posted in an article, mystery sightings.
[03:49:00.112 --> 03:49:00.673]  We're good.
[03:49:17.066 --> 03:49:18.447]  I guess everyone saw her!
[03:49:18.467 --> 03:49:19.368]  Wow, everyone saw her!
[03:49:38.334 --> 03:49:40.456]  And he locked his account.
[03:49:40.857 --> 03:49:55.011]  Now, you'd think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if all the speculation surrounding her health and what she's doing, where she is, how she's doing, that if she was there, she would be shown on camera, on video, or at least a still image, to show that she was there in person.
[03:49:55.211 --> 03:49:59.756]  They apparently couldn't even get a body double to show, to make it look like she was there.
[03:50:00.576 --> 03:50:15.167]  All these mainstream news media outlets reporting that she was there as though it was fact, as though they documented it themselves, and without any evidence to support that claim, just leads me to believe that there's something going on here.
[03:50:15.187 --> 03:50:22.792]  And if she is too sick, still, and too weak to come and perform her duties at the Supreme Court, and to attend events like this, that's fine.
[03:50:22.832 --> 03:50:23.433]  Just say so.
[03:50:23.833 --> 03:50:25.654]  But what's with all the secrecy?
[03:50:25.694 --> 03:50:26.515]  What's with the lying?
[03:50:26.935 --> 03:50:29.197]  And what was the concert really for?
[03:50:29.257 --> 03:50:30.819]  Was it a memorial about her life?
[03:50:31.199 --> 03:50:32.940]  Again, I go back to that Fox News graphic.
[03:50:33.221 --> 03:50:35.803]  You know, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 1933 to 2019.
[03:50:37.564 --> 03:50:38.445]  What's going on here?
[03:50:38.545 --> 03:50:42.829]  And legally, who would get in trouble if they were keeping her on ice?
[03:50:43.049 --> 03:50:45.711]  That's my next question.
[03:50:45.751 --> 03:50:46.592]  That's a great point.
[03:50:46.652 --> 03:50:48.554]  And you're also fuzzing up your mic too.
[03:50:49.390 --> 03:50:51.192]  It's all strings and tin cans right now.
[03:50:51.232 --> 03:50:52.793]  But anyway, Stone Cold Invasion of Privacy.
[03:50:52.813 --> 03:50:54.194]  Stone Cold Deep State Terrorism in my view.
[03:50:54.214 --> 03:50:54.514]  Roger Stone.
[03:51:16.783 --> 03:51:23.225]  Folks, you know about the situation with Roger Stone and the deep state, the Mueller deep state mechanism.
[03:51:24.125 --> 03:51:27.826]  I want to tell you something.
[03:51:28.026 --> 03:51:32.447]  I don't give a wit if you like Roger, if you don't like Roger.
[03:51:32.787 --> 03:51:35.808]  I could care less if you like me or don't like me.
[03:51:35.848 --> 03:51:39.389]  In fact, I prefer just not to be, I don't care.
[03:51:40.129 --> 03:51:42.010]  But you know, the people out there,
[03:51:42.968 --> 03:52:00.057]  And hear this loud and clear in my view, this is my personal opinion, but if you don't stand behind Roger Stone, if you don't stand behind the fact that the Apple, for example, and this is on the Gateway Pundit today, or yesterday, yesterday.
[03:52:00.597 --> 03:52:02.778]  Gateway Pundit, Jacob Bingle is writing about this.
[03:52:04.256 --> 03:52:11.304]  Apple refused to give the federal government the backdoor access to the iPhones of the San Bernardino terrorists.
[03:52:11.344 --> 03:52:16.769]  I know Alex talked about this before, maybe yesterday, I don't know.
[03:52:16.790 --> 03:52:17.891]  But think about this, alright?
[03:52:18.071 --> 03:52:25.519]  So, you've got Roger Stone, Apple giving deep state access to Roger Stone's iCloud account.
[03:52:26.387 --> 03:52:29.996]  After refusing to violate the privacy of San Bernadino Terrace.
[03:52:30.036 --> 03:52:31.360]  There it is right there.
[03:52:31.921 --> 03:52:34.267]  Jacob Ingalls from the Gateway Pundit.
[03:52:34.588 --> 03:52:35.070]  Now, again...
[03:52:35.706 --> 03:52:36.347]  It doesn't matter.
[03:52:36.367 --> 03:52:42.612]  It doesn't matter even if you agree with the ideology, agree with the person, like the person.
[03:52:42.692 --> 03:52:44.314]  It's not a popularity contest.
[03:52:44.774 --> 03:52:48.157]  It's a contest or it's an issue of rights.
[03:52:48.958 --> 03:52:50.439]  And it's more than that.
[03:52:50.499 --> 03:52:52.661]  It's an issue of right versus wrong.
[03:52:53.102 --> 03:52:56.845]  And then we get into the good versus evil aspect of this, but right versus wrong.
[03:52:57.469 --> 03:53:04.913]  And if you're out there, one of those drunken SEALs on Twitter clapping and putting up tweets saying, well, he deserves it and InfoWars should be shut down.
[03:53:04.953 --> 03:53:15.318]  Or if you're one of these googly-eyed mental patients out there tweeting from inside, you know, your straps from your bed, you can just get to your iPad or iPod or whatever, whatever thing you use.
[03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:21.891]  You know, celebrating this schadenfreude type thing.
[03:53:22.411 --> 03:53:41.055]  Well, then you need to have your head examined because the violation, the violations of the civil rights of Roger Stone, plus added to the mix, the deep state, the machinations of the deep state and the activities of the deep state against Roger Stone and others should have you urinating in your in your trousers.
[03:53:41.155 --> 03:53:41.435]  All right.
[03:53:41.635 --> 03:53:43.236]  Or whatever you might be wearing your knickers.
[03:53:43.716 --> 03:53:43.896]  Look,
[03:53:44.978 --> 03:53:48.300]  What we're seeing here is a tremendous affront to our civil rights.
[03:53:48.900 --> 03:53:50.721]  It's constitutionally wrong.
[03:53:50.761 --> 03:53:53.222]  I mean, this whole thing is wrong right from the beginning.
[03:53:53.762 --> 03:53:55.903]  And it's even more than a witch hunt.
[03:53:57.063 --> 03:54:00.305]  This is an attack by these Deep State members.
[03:54:00.985 --> 03:54:03.026]  And look, I don't have to drill this home.
[03:54:03.826 --> 03:54:08.008]  Understand the fact that, again, I guess my message here is this.
[03:54:09.671 --> 03:54:31.680]  When you look at the entire situation, the Mueller situation, the angry, what, a dozen and a half Democrats, the revelations of people like Sidney Powell, who have disclosed the Weissmanns of the world, the judicial overreach, the destruction of Arthur Anderson, the destruction through the Enron investigation, putting people in prison.
[03:54:31.720 --> 03:54:34.441]  Mueller's behind this, and of course, Mueller's role in Uranium One.
[03:54:34.981 --> 03:54:36.261]  Yeah, none of this is coming up.
[03:54:36.322 --> 03:54:37.982]  And of course, it's not only not coming up.
[03:54:38.382 --> 03:54:50.526]  When it does come up, it's labeled as fake news through places like, for example, like, in my professional opinion, NewsGuard, or these gatekeeping facilities on the Internet.
[03:54:51.066 --> 03:54:53.387]  Well, again, they ask you not to believe, in this case, too.
[03:54:53.707 --> 03:54:55.347]  Just like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, you know.
[03:54:55.508 --> 03:54:57.508]  Dude, hey, Norman's talking about it.
[03:54:57.548 --> 03:54:59.169]  Look, here's the deal.
[03:55:00.949 --> 03:55:03.110]  They are asking you not to believe your lying eyes.
[03:55:05.327 --> 03:55:05.968]  Don't believe that.
[03:55:06.148 --> 03:55:06.908]  Look over here.
[03:55:08.109 --> 03:55:13.353]  Look, just like Northam on abortion, it's the black face that we must talk about.
[03:55:13.413 --> 03:55:21.319]  Not his penchant for killing unborn children at the moment of birth.
[03:55:22.059 --> 03:55:22.660]  Don't look at that.
[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:24.061]  Look at the black face.
[03:55:24.621 --> 03:55:25.342]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:55:25.682 --> 03:55:28.204]  Oh, hey, the fact that no one saw her there?
[03:55:28.224 --> 03:55:28.784]  You didn't see her?
[03:55:28.984 --> 03:55:29.404]  I was there.
[03:55:29.565 --> 03:55:30.745]  Hey, I was there.
[03:55:30.825 --> 03:55:31.386]  I saw her.
[03:55:31.606 --> 03:55:32.827]  Yeah, just take my word for it.
[03:55:33.567 --> 03:55:41.309]  Like you mentioned, Apple turning over the iCloud data of Roger Stone to the Mueller investigative team.
[03:55:41.889 --> 03:55:45.790]  You know, they won't even unlock phones for terrorists, for the FBI.
[03:55:46.050 --> 03:55:46.990]  But, you know, here you go.
[03:55:47.690 --> 03:55:52.511]  Have at it to his all those private information contacts and whatever else might be in there.
[03:55:52.831 --> 03:55:55.812]  But just in the last two minutes, I want to talk about this real quick.
[03:55:55.912 --> 03:55:57.592]  By the way, we are all Roger Stone.
[03:55:57.632 --> 03:55:58.393]  I just want to say this.
[03:55:58.753 --> 03:56:00.073]  If you don't support Roger Stone,
[03:56:00.793 --> 03:56:05.536]  In my personal opinion, you're intellectually out to lunch, so go ahead and take it.
[03:56:06.376 --> 03:56:10.598]  Well, with the State of the Union address this year, we saw a few interesting things.
[03:56:10.698 --> 03:56:23.285]  One, it was delayed due to the Democrats and the government shutdown, but another thing we saw is a pre-battle to the State of the Union address by Kamala Harris, and then we saw the response to the State of the Union address given by failed Democrats,
[03:56:23.345 --> 03:56:23.645]  I think?
[03:56:40.216 --> 03:56:40.576]  I give up.
[03:57:01.894 --> 03:57:17.309]  Well, it's white people, it's Christians and Conservatives, and she is saying that this is, and they say that she started her, in this article, that she writes that, some incoherently, the less we have in common, the more united we all are.
[03:57:17.530 --> 03:57:25.938]  But in her article, even though it's illogical and dishonest, it's entirely vile, as she calls for all identity groups to overthrow the only people left out of her purported victim class.
[03:57:26.338 --> 03:57:26.598]  White.
[03:57:26.998 --> 03:57:42.365]  And this is a common theme amongst not only politicians here in America, but also in Europe, where they are bringing in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of illegal immigrants, and they are changing the culture and demonizing whites to the point you can't even speak out against the invasion coming against you.
[03:57:42.646 --> 03:57:46.427]  And speaking of invasions, we have our own caravans coming up at the southern border.
[03:57:46.487 --> 03:57:48.628]  Folks, infowars.com is the website.
[03:57:48.768 --> 03:57:49.429]  Hagman Report.
[03:57:49.689 --> 03:57:50.489]  Hagman Report Live.
[03:57:50.529 --> 03:57:51.310]  Go watch our shows.
[03:57:51.390 --> 03:57:52.010]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:56.511 --> 03:58:00.032]  Andy wants to talk about being involved in the fight for the 2nd A. Yeah, that's the big one.
[03:58:00.533 --> 03:58:01.693]  They're coming at the guns.
[03:58:01.733 --> 03:58:04.154]  The Democrats say they have the votes in the House to ban semi-autos.
[03:58:04.174 --> 03:58:05.655]  They're going to try to pass it.
[03:58:06.015 --> 03:58:09.816]  Notice they've gone from denying they want to ban the 2nd Amendment to admitting it, Andy.
[03:58:10.076 --> 03:58:11.117]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:58:11.177 --> 03:58:12.897]  I've got to say, Alex, I'm a big fan of the show.
[03:58:12.917 --> 03:58:14.078]  I still have both of my daughters.
[03:58:14.438 --> 03:58:15.919]  And keep fighting the good fight.
[03:58:15.959 --> 03:58:22.382]  Before I get to my point, I just want to say real quick, big time hunter, and I'll tell you at 4 o'clock in the morning, nothing gets me ready to go out into the woods.
[03:58:22.422 --> 03:58:24.462]  Like a drop of Secret 12, a little Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:24.482 --> 03:58:25.803]  Guys, you need to try that stuff.
[03:58:25.823 --> 03:58:27.944]  Get out there and support the fight and do yourself some good.
[03:58:27.964 --> 03:58:28.824]  Thanks for the great products.
[03:58:28.844 --> 03:58:31.305]  I need to take some of that because I'm a little bit run down with allergies today.
[03:58:31.325 --> 03:58:32.906]  And I'm always like, wait, my own products are great.
[03:58:32.926 --> 03:58:34.627]  I think I should take some Brain Force Pluses.
[03:58:34.787 --> 03:58:35.868]  Secret 12, you're absolutely right.
[03:58:35.908 --> 03:58:36.408]  There you go.
[03:58:36.489 --> 03:58:43.075]  Well, hey, in my home state of Connecticut here, we're facing some very tough economic times, which is causing taxes to go up.
[03:58:43.115 --> 03:58:45.437]  There's businesses and people leaving the state in droves.
[03:58:45.637 --> 03:58:52.924]  One of the taxes they're introducing, or want to, hopefully this won't pass, is they want a 50% tax on your ammunition, no matter what it is.
[03:58:53.004 --> 03:58:58.389]  They also forced, I mean, they forced Remington out of business, the same law firm suing me, sued Remington out of business.
[03:58:58.509 --> 03:58:59.770]  Yeah, another law they're trying to pass.
