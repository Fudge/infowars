[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.230]  You didn't listen on President Trump's call and President Zelensky's call?
[00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:02.851]  I did not.
[00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:04.552]  You've never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney?
[00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:05.453]  I never did.
[00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:06.573]  You never met the President?
[00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:07.254]  That's correct.
[00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:09.375]  You had three meetings again with Zelensky and it didn't come up.
[00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.237]  And two of those they had never heard about as far as I know.
[00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:15.459]  And President Zelensky never made an announcement.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.861]  This is what I can't believe and you're their star witness.
[00:00:19.742 --> 00:00:20.663]  You're their first witness.
[00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:29.899]  You're the guy, you're the guy, based on this, based on, I mean I've seen, I've seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this.
[00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:43.967]  Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told, now again this is, I hereby swear and affirm from Gordon Sondland, Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yarmock on September 1st, this all happens by the way.
[00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:49.737]  This all happens, by the way, in Warsaw, where Vice President Pence meets with President Zelensky.
[00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:50.298]  And guess what?
[00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.100]  They didn't talk about any linkage either.
[00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.332]  Mr. I was not wrong about what I told you, which is what I heard.
[00:01:07.432 --> 00:01:08.533]  That's all I've said.
[00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:09.914]  I've told you what I heard.
[00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:11.035]  And that's the point.
[00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:13.456]  What you heard did not happen.
[00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:15.118]  It didn't happen.
[00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:16.999]  You had three meetings with the guy.
[00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.840]  He could have told you.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.363]  He didn't announce he was going to do an investigation before the aid happened.
[00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:23.544]  It's not just could it have been wrong.
[00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:27.067]  The fact is it was wrong because it didn't happen.
[00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:33.592]  The whole point was you had a clear understanding that aid will not get released unless there's a commitment
[00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.440]  Not maybe, not I think the aid might happen, it's my hunch it's going to get released.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.785]  You used clear language, clear understanding and commitment.
[00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:45.571]  And those two things didn't happen, so you had to be wrong.
[00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:59.255]  Mr. Jordan, the other thing that went on when that assistance was on hold is we shook the confidence of a close partner in our reliability.
[00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:03.256]  And that... That's not what this proceeding is about, Ambassador Jones.
[00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:05.217]  That's not what this whole thing started on.
[00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:12.039]  I think Eric Charmella needs to be pulled in for testimony and then I think it'll be ultimately determined at that point.
[00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.580]  But I think he is a person of interest in the sense that
[00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.334]  He was at the Ukraine desk when Joe Biden was there, when Hunter Biden was working for the Ukrainian oligarch.
[00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:25.638]  So simply for that alone, I think he's a material witness and needs to be brought in.
[00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:39.689]  The other question is, is while the whistleblower is protected from being fired and from retaliation, and I think for court proceedings, the whistleblower is not protected from being asked who gave him the information because we can't have a country
[00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:53.012]  Just to ask a clarifying question, do you anticipate when we might vote on the ability to have the whistleblower in front of us?
[00:02:53.052 --> 00:03:03.277]  Something you, of the 435 members of Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is, and your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress who's had a chance to talk with that individual.
[00:03:03.797 --> 00:03:04.818]  We would like that opportunity.
[00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.339]  When might that happen in this proceeding today?
[00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.460]  First, as the gentleman knows, that's a false statement.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.842]  I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I'm determined to make sure that identity is protected.
[00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:23.966]  But as I said to Mr. Conaway, you will have an opportunity, after the witnesses testify, to make a motion to subpoena any witness and compel a vote.
[00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:28.065]  I said this last week, but this is a sad day.
[00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.086]  This is a sad day for this country.
[00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.509]  You think about what the Democrats have put our nation through for the last three years.
[00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:45.117]  Started July of 2016 when they spied on two American citizens associated with the presidential campaign, and all that unfolded with the Mueller investigation after that, and when that didn't work, here we are.
[00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:46.858]  Based on this.
[00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.040]  Based on this is a
[00:03:50.353 --> 00:03:51.893]  The American people see through all this.
[00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:54.474]  They understand the facts support the president.
[00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:56.434]  They understand this process is unfair.
[00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:59.675]  And they see through the whole... Gentlemen.
[00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:06.596]  It is Thursday, November 14th, 2019.
[00:04:07.176 --> 00:04:10.037]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:15.918]  And we are broadcasting worldwide with 354 days left until the historic election.
[00:04:20.558 --> 00:04:24.020]  And I got to tell you, I've got some really, really good news today.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.524]  And I've got some really, really bad news for everybody here today.
[00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:38.349]  Now, we're going to lay all this out.
[00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:40.570]  We're going to roll through all this today.
[00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.094]  We broadcast live worldwide on this Thursday edition.
[00:04:48.683 --> 00:04:51.524]  But I got to tell you that we've got a lot of stuff going on.
[00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:55.346]  We've got a lot of big, interesting developments that are unfolding.
[00:04:56.426 --> 00:05:05.270]  And that is, they want to basically railroad Roger Stone, as we all know.
[00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:12.013]  And once they set the precedent for that, they think they're going to railroad everybody else.
[00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:14.654]  And it's real tearing.
[00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:17.715]  And it's woken a lot of people up.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.583]  And I've learned a lot of really horrible things about the trial from the Stone Camp last night and this morning.
[00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:26.706]  And from some reporters that are going to be joining us.
[00:05:27.907 --> 00:05:30.489]  And this whole thing is a lot bigger than Roger Stone.
[00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.033]  This is about due process in this country being flushed down the toilet.
[00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:43.960]  Because once due process is gone, if you think there's already tyranny in this country, well wait, we'll get as bad as North Korea.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.263]  Probably a lot worse because we tend to do everything real big here in America.
[00:05:49.764 --> 00:05:56.629]  So as soon as I'm able to tell you the stuff that's going on behind the scenes, the stone trial, I will, I'm able to tell you a lot that I already know.
[00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:01.713]  And I'll be getting to that coming up at the bottom of the hour, but that's the bad news.
[00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:06.897]  I'm going to give you the good news.
[00:06:08.498 --> 00:06:13.982]  When we come back at the start of the next segment.
[00:06:16.894 --> 00:06:20.395]  Because I'm always trying to get people to be realist.
[00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:31.140]  I want people to know how serious the fight is and how the establishment's trying to overwhelm us and get us to give up.
[00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:41.184]  Other people think that everything's going to be just fine if we all just stick with the plan, whatever magic plan that is.
[00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:46.426]  But the rot of the Democrats and their arrogance
[00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:50.723]  Is there strength, but it's also their weakness.
[00:06:53.264 --> 00:07:07.873]  And if you look at the headlines that are up at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, they're pretty amazing because it's from the Associated Press.
[00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:09.614]  It's from the Hill.
[00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:15.758]  Hell, it's even a couple of the headlines at CNN.
[00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:19.358]  And there it is.
[00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:23.321]  AP calls impeachment hearings a scam.
[00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:27.125]  Because it is a scam.
[00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:35.854]  Everybody can see that they're calling it the biggest bombshell ever against Trump and proof of quid pro quo.
[00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:42.940]  And then all it is is people saying again they heard it third hand and could never say who actually originally heard it.
[00:07:43.902 --> 00:07:48.965]  And now Adam Schiff says there is no whistleblower basically, which we originally said at the start of all this.
[00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:50.166]  Mike Adams called it first.
[00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:59.172]  He said it's Clapper and Brennan and Hillary and Obama know that Trump was exposing the corrupt Ukrainian deal they were all involved in.
[00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:01.334]  Mitt Romney was involved as well.
[00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:06.417]  And so because Trump was getting close, they would just turn it around and say it was Trump.
[00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:12.742]  Just like they did with the whole Russia gate.
[00:08:14.071 --> 00:08:15.792]  Situation and that's really it.
[00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:19.994]  So the wheels have come off, almost no viewers.
[00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:24.556]  And you can say, oh, well, then Trump's going to be fine.
[00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:25.136]  No.
[00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:29.158]  Because they have the votes in the House to pass the impeachment.
[00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:37.562]  And that's the next phase is the Democrats are now calling for there not to be a trial in the Senate, just if the House
[00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:45.653]  Votes that impeachment proceedings have initiated, well they already had the trial they're claiming, even though that's not how it works, with this show trial.
[00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:54.916]  And so the Senate doesn't need one, because if they have a real trial, Trump will be totally and completely exonerated, just like Roger Stone would have been.
[00:08:56.517 --> 00:08:59.978]  I am predicting that Roger Stone will be found guilty.
[00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:04.420]  On all six counts, probably.
[00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:08.251]  By the rigged jury.
[00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:10.493]  And believe me, is it rigged.
[00:09:10.513 --> 00:09:21.062]  Remember, we exposed, it was in the news, that a major Democrat official from the Obama administration, his husband worked for the Mueller probe, was selected for the jury.
[00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:31.490]  When we exposed that and said you shouldn't have Obama or Hillary or anybody else that worked for him at a high level on the jury, they said I should be arrested for jury tampering when all I was doing was exposing corruption.
[00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.452]  Of course, it turned out it was all totally legal.
[00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:42.148]  But now we know that there are a bunch of other Obama officials and Hillary officials and spooks from the CIA are indeed...
[00:09:43.388 --> 00:09:46.909]  On that jury, one juror clearly was supporting Stone.
[00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:53.152]  She fell down yesterday and hit her head and was replaced by an alternate juror, as they call them.
[00:09:53.632 --> 00:09:54.913]  No, you can't make this up.
[00:09:55.653 --> 00:10:02.916]  And we'll have reporters on the ground who have been in the trial, Jacob Engels and Joe Biggs, at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:07.038]  And this is a window into this evil, corrupt world.
[00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:07.598]  But first,
[00:10:09.278 --> 00:10:28.086]  I'm going to get into the wheels flying off the fake impeachment charade, fiasco, but they don't care because they're going to bring more hoaxes forward and get the legalese in position they believe to blackmail and threaten the Senate.
[00:10:29.005 --> 00:10:34.949]  With all sorts of criminal destabilization, they're going to pull into Christmas and into next year.
[00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:41.473]  Now, I think the wheels coming off in the House means they probably won't get the trial going until early next year.
[00:10:41.493 --> 00:10:43.935]  They're getting behind on their timetable.
[00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:51.019]  But the fact that they're so bold, even though it's badly coordinated, is their strength.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.260]  They're on the attack.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.161]  They're on the offensive.
[00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:56.323]  The fact that it's been so discrediting, though,
[00:10:57.423 --> 00:11:01.407]  If Trump would take action, if we would take action, if we would get on the offense, there's a lot of ways to do that.
[00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:05.891]  We could really mop up these guys peacefully, legally, and lawfully right now.
[00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:13.579]  But the longer that the more sane people in the establishment have this sit back and watch,
[00:11:14.972 --> 00:11:18.996]  Attitude, the worse things are going to get and the more things are going to deteriorate.
[00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:22.960]  So to say that we're in dangerous or interesting times is really an understatement.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.964]  This is an incredibly important point in human history right now.
[00:11:27.024 --> 00:11:32.850]  And I can tell you that when Roger is convicted, and I'm almost always right, maybe a miracle is going to happen.
[00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.635]  You know, I talked to him last night and he said only a miracle of God right now is going to
[00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:41.186]  Stop this.
[00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:42.908]  And he said he wouldn't talk about what happened inside.
[00:11:42.928 --> 00:11:45.990]  He's not going to give the judge any reason to nail him even harder.
[00:11:46.491 --> 00:12:04.665]  So I talked to people who were in the courtroom and they said that the jury shakes with hate at him and stares at him like they want to kill him in their virtue signaling to the media and all of the intelligence agency operatives and Obama and Hillary officials that are in there staring at Roger like they want to kill him.
[00:12:07.047 --> 00:12:08.608]  So I would expect a quick
[00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:16.350]  Verdict, they have been deliberating since 10 a.m.
[00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:27.653]  Eastern, so that's two hours and 14 minutes, and we'll be watching that as it unfolds live here at Band.Video and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:12:28.353 --> 00:12:31.874]  And I know I talk about this a lot, and it's because it's the absolute truth.
[00:12:32.915 --> 00:12:36.796]  If I'm a fish, InfoWars' audience is the ocean.
[00:12:40.117 --> 00:12:41.577]  And without you, we're not here.
[00:12:43.114 --> 00:12:45.495]  But really, we're all just fish in this ocean together.
[00:12:45.935 --> 00:12:48.096]  And free speech and liberty and freedom is the ocean.
[00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:50.377]  And the globalists are trying to poison that sea.
[00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:51.797]  They're trying to drain that sea.
[00:12:51.817 --> 00:12:53.098]  They're trying to boil that sea.
[00:12:54.478 --> 00:12:57.880]  And they're openly admitting a post-human world, and I don't want to let them win.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.161]  And so this is the Great Animating Contest of Liberty.
[00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:04.082]  And things are getting really, really hot right now.
[00:13:04.682 --> 00:13:08.664]  There's so much more coming up today on this November 14th.
[00:13:10.563 --> 00:13:14.505]  2019 Thursday live broadcast teleprompter free.
[00:13:15.265 --> 00:13:15.765]  I'm real.
[00:13:16.345 --> 00:13:16.866]  You're real.
[00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:18.066]  God's real.
[00:13:18.446 --> 00:13:19.747]  But the devil's real as well.
[00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:24.329]  We've got to make our cosmic eternal infinity decision.
[00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:26.189]  Which side we're on.
[00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.152]  November 14th, 2019 on this live Thursday edition.
[00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:35.573]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:13:38.686 --> 00:13:50.877]  If Roger Stone is found guilty by what appears to be a kangaroo railroad court operation, then we launch Operation Free Roger Stone.
[00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:56.662]  And we have already launched that contingency.
[00:13:56.682 --> 00:14:01.606]  And we'll be breaking that down more next segment.
[00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:12.626]  But when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cried, appease, appease, are hung by those they tried to please.
[00:14:14.147 --> 00:14:23.613]  But let's get to the impeachment fiasco yesterday, and now today.
[00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:27.156]  And the wheels, as I've said completely,
[00:14:28.413 --> 00:14:34.998]  Coming off just like Russiagate collapsed, but they will simply come up with a new scam.
[00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.321]  And I predict they will vote in the House of Representatives.
[00:14:41.242 --> 00:14:42.363]  By the end of this year.
[00:14:43.744 --> 00:14:46.386]  To initiate the trial in the Senate.
[00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:49.207]  They will pass the indictment in the House now.
[00:14:50.729 --> 00:14:56.773]  That's the way this jurisprudence works when it comes to the legislative body of the three branches of government.
[00:14:57.938 --> 00:14:58.819]  One of the three branches.
[00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:11.294]  And so, yes, this is a big victory that this was so hollow, so flat, and they had to have sickening operatives like Mr. Wallace on Fox News.
[00:15:13.407 --> 00:15:15.908]  Call it very damaging to Trump.
[00:15:16.008 --> 00:15:21.809]  And then he gushed over one of the ambassador's Edward R. Murrow voices.
[00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:24.689]  Oh, his voice sounded so amazing.
[00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:37.372]  He heard from somebody that heard Trump on the phone saying he wanted them to have a criminal investigation of the Deep State's criminal activities.
[00:15:39.453 --> 00:15:41.373]  Even if that was true, wow, how horrible.
[00:15:43.783 --> 00:15:49.366]  But you see, their real success here is sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
[00:15:50.266 --> 00:16:12.258]  Because while we're defending the fact that we're not Russian agents, while we're defending the fact that Trump wasn't engaged in corruption, and was doing his job as the chief executive trying to root out corruption if people are going to get money from us, all the other big issues are going on and the Democrats have their jurisdictions collapsing into crime.
[00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:32.622]  And feces, and homelessness, and drugs, and earthquakes, and burning cities, and just giant illegal alien invasions, and attacks on our free speech, and massive censorship, unprecedented levels of suicide.
[00:16:32.642 --> 00:16:38.283]  Now,
[00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:40.779]  Let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:42.520]  Sad day or scam?
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.360]  What to watch?
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.040]  AP saying, is it a scam?
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.961]  The fact that they would even say something like that because it is a scam.
[00:16:52.781 --> 00:16:53.902]  All based on hearsay.
[00:16:57.762 --> 00:16:59.322]  But I'll tell you what's beautiful about this.
[00:16:59.883 --> 00:17:04.503]  Due process, though it's fighting for its life, came through again.
[00:17:06.644 --> 00:17:07.484]  Because Eric,
[00:17:09.372 --> 00:17:38.648]  Sierra Mela of the CIA, who it turns out was involved with Hunter Biden, and these shady dealings, presiding over some of it, had the motive to attack Trump and make this up, had bosses above him like Obama, Hillary, Brennan, that he worked directly for, hates Trump, his lawyer hates Trump, in between praising Epstein and praising, well, helping pedophiles,
[00:17:40.365 --> 00:17:41.905]  What a group of scum.
[00:17:44.786 --> 00:17:55.029]  That no one was supposed to say his name so no one could challenge him and find out that he wasn't the first-hand person either because that person doesn't exist.
[00:17:56.729 --> 00:18:06.832]  And now, this morning, Schiff has to admit
[00:18:08.393 --> 00:18:10.094]  That their quote isn't a whistleblower.
[00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:18.039]  Just as Mike Adams, the guy's smart, first predicted on this show months ago.
[00:18:22.502 --> 00:18:24.023]  They just made it up in a committee.
[00:18:24.043 --> 00:18:26.905]  They all met Secret Louis Schiff, we know that.
[00:18:27.305 --> 00:18:29.066]  They cooked up this giant fraud.
[00:18:31.648 --> 00:18:35.050]  And then they just hoped having enough people say they heard it third hand,
[00:18:36.084 --> 00:18:42.056]  Would make quid pro quo a reason to remove Trump, but it turns out under the Constitution, quid pro quo's not bad.
[00:18:42.717 --> 00:18:47.085]  If Kennedy says, we'll take our missiles out of Turkey if you take your missiles out of Cuba.
[00:18:48.851 --> 00:18:49.872]  That's tit for tat.
[00:18:49.912 --> 00:18:51.233]  That's what the executive branch does.
[00:18:51.513 --> 00:19:06.687]  If Trump would have said, I'll give you a billion dollars if you license my hotels all over your country and waive the taxes, then I would call for Trump to be impeached and he would be impeached because it's called quid pro quo bribery.
[00:19:06.707 --> 00:19:12.632]  That's the type of stuff the Democrats do all day long.
[00:19:14.198 --> 00:19:15.278]  And Trump doesn't like that.
[00:19:15.298 --> 00:19:16.079]  He's trying to stop it.
[00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:19.900]  And that's why this group of arrogant crooks is so upset.
[00:19:23.142 --> 00:19:27.044]  So we'll play all those clips coming up, but this is really a big, big deal.
[00:19:27.104 --> 00:19:27.924]  Here's the problem.
[00:19:29.425 --> 00:19:31.265]  They're going to move forward with new lies.
[00:19:31.886 --> 00:19:34.507]  They're going to get their impeachment, I predict, in the House.
[00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:40.204]  And then they're going to twist arms in the Senate, and now it's in the news that they're challenging McConnell.
[00:19:40.244 --> 00:19:43.066]  The Democrats are, oh, we'll show enough evidence here.
[00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:44.848]  You don't need to have the trial in the Senate.
[00:19:45.428 --> 00:19:48.991]  Schiff's already done that and are going to do that in the other committees.
[00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:51.512]  What a sick joke.
[00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:54.254]  So they tried to get all their ponies in a row.
[00:19:54.274 --> 00:19:58.157]  They tried to have their dress rehearsals in the basement of the Capitol.
[00:19:59.258 --> 00:19:59.978]  That didn't work.
[00:20:04.021 --> 00:20:04.722]  And so now
[00:20:07.056 --> 00:20:21.084]  They're just going to continue the process on and the Democrats under Pelosi's control are going to order their members of their evil party to vote for the impeachment.
[00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:27.247]  And it's going to drag into the election year with no shame by these crooks.
[00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:30.269]  You know, Avenatti
[00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:37.028]  Has been indicted again for reported scams and blackmail with Nike.
[00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:39.529]  And that's really the path here.
[00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:47.714]  He was the big darling of the media, running all these clear criminal scams, and it finally caught up to him.
[00:20:48.994 --> 00:20:59.540]  But what Schiff's done, and what Hillary's done, and what Pelosi's done, and what CNN's done, and what all the media's done, aiding and abetting this fraud,
[00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:11.404]  Is a giant criminal fraud way bigger than the creepy porn lawyer ever could imagine.
[00:21:13.945 --> 00:21:17.106]  And you're still going to have people like Chris Wallace, that little bootlicker.
[00:21:21.547 --> 00:21:28.950]  Just gush over damning, incredible, amazing, oh my gosh, Trump is in so much trouble.
[00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:35.953]  That will still fool a certain percentage of people, but the vast majority know enough about due process in America.
[00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:50.406]  To hear the same rumors over and over again and say the crime is what these people are all doing, trying to block the 2016 election and nullify it and steal the upcoming election because they don't like what the people did.
[00:21:50.426 --> 00:21:52.569]  This is an attack on us.
[00:21:55.003 --> 00:21:57.845]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[00:21:57.885 --> 00:21:59.707]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:22:00.147 --> 00:22:01.388]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:06.272]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:22:07.372 --> 00:22:15.979]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:20.983]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:22:21.263 --> 00:22:24.764]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:22:25.184 --> 00:22:33.545]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:22:34.005 --> 00:22:35.306]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:22:35.566 --> 00:22:36.586]  I want them shut down.
[00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.566]  I want them silenced.
[00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:38.406]  I want them muted.
[00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:40.286]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:22:41.587 --> 00:22:42.947]  I want them shut down!
[00:22:42.967 --> 00:22:44.527]  I want them silenced!
[00:22:44.547 --> 00:22:45.307]  I want them muted!
[00:22:45.787 --> 00:22:46.468]  But don't worry.
[00:22:47.048 --> 00:22:48.748]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:22:52.136 --> 00:23:09.172]  All right, I have talked to Roger Stone last night and this morning, and I've talked to a lot of the reporters that were in the trial yesterday, where the closing statements of the defense and the prosecution ended at 10 a.m.
[00:23:09.572 --> 00:23:12.114]  Eastern, about two and a half hours ago.
[00:23:15.237 --> 00:23:16.779]  They began deliberations
[00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:23.549]  Now, Roger hasn't violated his gag order getting into the case with me.
[00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:28.113]  He just said that he leaves it in God's hands and that he's praying for a miracle.
[00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:32.677]  And then I talked to reporters like Joe Biggs, Jacob Ingles, and others.
[00:23:34.178 --> 00:23:43.826]  Jacob Ingalls has been threatened with arrest if he talks about the Obama officials that they put on the jury, not just the one that we exposed, the judge removed, but others.
[00:23:44.046 --> 00:23:53.714]  And as soon as the verdict comes out, you're going to get to learn about what is undoubtedly the fakest trial I've ever heard of in U.S.
[00:23:53.734 --> 00:23:54.074]  history.
[00:23:55.215 --> 00:23:56.256]  And I've studied a lot of history.
[00:23:56.296 --> 00:23:56.997]  I'm addicted to it.
[00:23:57.077 --> 00:24:00.840]  I've never heard of a kangaroo court like this in the U.S.
[00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:15.004]  Before we had our main due process and things, there were violations of it, like the Salem Witch Trials and things, so that went on, but that was pre-1776 and our Revolutionary War and what we went to war for.
[00:24:15.044 --> 00:24:18.646]  A lot of it was due process, and you read that in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:24:20.127 --> 00:24:27.190]  And the special courts that the king had set up that were really violating people that were packed with pick juries and grand juries.
[00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.992]  So, we're all Roger Stone.
[00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:36.513]  You know, Trump acts tough, and he is tough, and he's hardworking, and he cares about the country, but he's really a nice guy.
[00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:40.215]  Stone's been called a villain by these people for years.
[00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:41.435]  He just played into it.
[00:24:41.455 --> 00:24:42.956]  The guy's not a villain at all.
[00:24:42.976 --> 00:24:44.737]  It's more like Mr. Magoo.
[00:24:45.577 --> 00:24:46.258]  But he is smart.
[00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:55.282]  And he did help get Trump elected, and he was advising Trump on an every-other-day basis throughout the campaign.
[00:24:56.003 --> 00:24:58.124]  And I was there in some of those phone calls.
[00:25:00.339 --> 00:25:02.681]  I mean, Stone would say, hey, Alex is getting married next week.
[00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:03.742]  Call in and congratulate him.
[00:25:03.762 --> 00:25:04.683]  And boom, Trump would call.
[00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.926]  And they had Trump's phones tapped during the campaign.
[00:25:07.946 --> 00:25:10.288]  And they had them tapped once he was at the White House.
[00:25:10.348 --> 00:25:10.868]  We knew that.
[00:25:11.048 --> 00:25:11.949]  We first broke that.
[00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.911]  And it came out in court.
[00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:18.815]  White House aides testified that Trump was talking to Stone every other day.
[00:25:19.435 --> 00:25:20.316]  Sometimes for an hour.
[00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:25.581]  Hell, I got invited once to
[00:25:27.116 --> 00:25:31.098]  Mar-a-Lago, and to go through the secret tunnel, but I didn't go because I had a family emergency.
[00:25:31.978 --> 00:25:33.099]  But, you know, Roger went.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:43.204]  And I'm not telling any secrets here that the establishment doesn't know, because the President's phones are tapped by the criminal permanent deep state.
[00:25:43.904 --> 00:25:52.168]  And so that's why they got enraged by Stone and were obsessed with him, was because he was giving the President great advice.
[00:25:53.692 --> 00:25:55.433]  Because they go back 44 years now.
[00:25:56.113 --> 00:25:57.814]  And Stone used to be Trump's wingman.
[00:25:58.515 --> 00:25:58.835]  Dating.
[00:25:59.936 --> 00:26:00.816]  And Trump's beard.
[00:26:01.136 --> 00:26:04.919]  And again, Trump is not having a beard for homosexual sex.
[00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:12.903]  Beards go the other way, too, where your buddy goes out with you and your girlfriend when you're famous so people don't know that you're out with your girlfriend.
[00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:13.984]  They think it's their girlfriend.
[00:26:14.905 --> 00:26:20.548]  And that's what Stone and Trump go way back in is originally sometimes dating the same women.
[00:26:24.468 --> 00:26:26.549]  So yeah, they've gotten water out of the same well, as they say.
[00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:31.330]  So, that's what's going on here, and they know all that about Trump, okay?
[00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.651]  And they want his wingman in prison as a message to Trump, we're gonna get you.
[00:26:39.092 --> 00:26:41.073]  And I can tell you, the two get in fights with each other, too.
[00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:46.074]  I mean, Stone talks straight to the President, and they get in big arguments and all the rest of it.
[00:26:46.955 --> 00:26:51.636]  So, they've gotten in fights over girlfriends that each other had back and forth.
[00:26:52.605 --> 00:26:53.925]  They never double teamed any chicks.
[00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:57.426]  And I'm not trying to get graphic here, but the media will, you know, spin all this stuff.
[00:26:58.287 --> 00:26:59.947]  So that's why they want to put him in prison.
[00:26:59.987 --> 00:27:01.028]  He had nothing to do with WikiLeaks.
[00:27:01.048 --> 00:27:01.848]  He didn't lie about it.
[00:27:03.028 --> 00:27:05.169]  Assange was saying it's going to hurt Hillary really bad.
[00:27:05.609 --> 00:27:06.469]  Everybody knew that.
[00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:07.610]  We were saying, oh, it's huge.
[00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.050]  It's huge.
[00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.910]  We believed it was huge.
[00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.671]  And Assange delivered.
[00:27:11.271 --> 00:27:13.932]  And the president said, hey, I don't know who's got all this stuff.
[00:27:15.432 --> 00:27:17.893]  But whoever's got it, WikiLeaks, whoever, release it.
[00:27:17.993 --> 00:27:19.293]  Russians, if you've got it, release it.
[00:27:19.673 --> 00:27:21.574]  It's about what Hillary did wrong.
[00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:24.012]  Not about who got the stuff.
[00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:27.133]  But again, they changed the subject.
[00:27:27.473 --> 00:27:29.654]  The Clintons, Obama, Romney.
[00:27:31.635 --> 00:27:34.576]  Oh, Romney is... The Obama phone lady calls him.
[00:27:36.037 --> 00:27:38.117]  The whistleblower, CIA Ramallah.
[00:27:40.218 --> 00:27:40.959]  Sierra Ramallah.
[00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:42.619]  He was involved.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.300]  Now he's not a whistleblower anymore.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.261]  He never heard it firsthand either.
[00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:47.866]  It's all made up.
[00:27:48.326 --> 00:27:48.966]  Chef now admits it.
[00:27:49.166 --> 00:27:49.906]  Oh, you can't call him.
[00:27:50.247 --> 00:27:50.987]  He wants a whistleblower.
[00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:51.827]  He's not a witness.
[00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:56.088]  He's just the star witness that Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter wouldn't let you say his damn name.
[00:27:56.588 --> 00:27:58.528]  They called for Donald Trump Jr.'
[00:27:58.508 --> 00:27:59.808]  's arrest for saying it.
[00:27:59.948 --> 00:28:03.749]  They called for my arrest for exposing jurors whose husbands were in the molar probe.
[00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.330]  Oh, he's such a tough CIA agent.
[00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.530]  He wants to sink the president and never get face down.
[00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.651]  Well, Rand Paul just exposed his ass.
[00:28:14.804 --> 00:28:15.364]  I'm public.
[00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:16.445]  My name's out in the open.
[00:28:16.465 --> 00:28:19.466]  My phones are tapped because I support America.
[00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:21.946]  I got the criminal deep state up my rear end.
[00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:25.327]  Let's go to Joe Biggs.
[00:28:25.848 --> 00:28:28.348]  He's with Free Speech TV and the great work over there with Gavin McGinnis.
[00:28:28.388 --> 00:28:29.469]  Glad they haven't kept him off the air.
[00:28:29.529 --> 00:28:30.469]  Former InfoWars reporter.
[00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:32.090]  Joe, you've been there.
[00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.031]  The judge just threatens everybody and says, don't talk about anything in here.
[00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:38.712]  Well, nobody's ever supposed to be like that.
[00:28:39.454 --> 00:28:40.455]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:28:41.555 --> 00:28:44.257]  And other people I talked to are just too scared to even come on here.
[00:28:44.317 --> 00:28:47.699]  Hell, they're calling for my arrest for just exposing what this judge is doing.
[00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:48.699]  These people are crazy.
[00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:50.840]  But you notice their facades coming down.
[00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:54.102]  The impeachment fiasco is collapsing, total lies.
[00:28:54.822 --> 00:28:59.185]  Now they're saying CIA Ramallah is not a whistleblower.
[00:28:59.205 --> 00:29:00.245]  In fact, there's just not one.
[00:29:00.265 --> 00:29:01.866]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:02.967]  What have you been witnessing?
[00:29:02.987 --> 00:29:04.868]  I know the jury's out for Roger right now.
[00:29:06.325 --> 00:29:14.932]  Yeah, so we're standing outside of the Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in Washington, D.C., where the jury is currently deliberating over what they're going to do.
[00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:19.175]  You know, we're expecting it to be just not good.
[00:29:19.255 --> 00:29:23.539]  You know, we've seen that this has been a hit from the get go, but we're all hoping for the best.
[00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:24.880]  We know one of the jurors got sick.
[00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:28.942]  She was a lady that would actually kind of snarl at the sight of Roger.
[00:29:28.982 --> 00:29:30.723]  So she's now been replaced with someone else.
[00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:32.124]  So that could be good news.
[00:29:32.164 --> 00:29:32.665]  You never know.
[00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:38.109]  But what we've seen is just complete and total BS from the prosecution.
[00:29:38.129 --> 00:29:39.030]  They don't have anything.
[00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.411]  They're trying to word stuff a certain way.
[00:29:41.572 --> 00:29:43.153]  So it comes off to the jury.
[00:29:43.724 --> 00:29:44.045]  I think so.
[00:30:05.445 --> 00:30:12.829]  There's no more justice here that whenever the president goes after someone and actually calls out wrongdoing and the Democrats, what do they do?
[00:30:12.869 --> 00:30:14.550]  They flip it and go after him.
[00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.852]  They flip it and they go after someone else that he cares about, someone close to him.
[00:30:18.112 --> 00:30:19.533]  And that's what we're seeing happening right here today.
[00:30:19.853 --> 00:30:20.414]  That's right.
[00:30:20.454 --> 00:30:23.195]  And we're learning a lot from the final days of the prosecution.
[00:30:23.235 --> 00:30:24.656]  You'll learn about exclusively straight ahead.
[00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:28.018]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:28.178 --> 00:30:31.000]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:30:33.032 --> 00:30:36.534]  I'll tell you, I'm not somebody that acts like I have empathy.
[00:30:37.254 --> 00:30:40.716]  I'm not somebody that acts like I'm concerned about somebody, unless I really am.
[00:30:40.736 --> 00:30:47.279]  And I'm really surprised how much I'm worried about Roger Stone.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.700]  I mean, I like the guy.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.341]  I know the guy.
[00:30:51.381 --> 00:30:51.901]  He's a man.
[00:30:52.021 --> 00:30:52.501]  I'm a man.
[00:30:52.941 --> 00:30:54.142]  He knows the business he's in.
[00:30:54.282 --> 00:30:55.983]  It's a dangerous game, fighting these tyrants.
[00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:14.617]  But just to watch them systematically rig the media, rig the indictment, rig the jury, and to learn the judge laughing and snorting and cackling and not letting him have any of his witnesses, and then to learn what was in the prosecution as they closed, making it all about Trump.
[00:31:14.697 --> 00:31:18.158]  He was never allowed to make it about politics, but the prosecutors.
[00:31:18.178 --> 00:31:19.659]  Oh, I've got it all right here.
[00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:20.759]  USA Today.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.601]  Prosecutor says Roger Stone lied to Congress to protect Trump.
[00:31:25.862 --> 00:31:29.104]  And they go on to say it's proof of the Russians when there was no proof.
[00:31:29.744 --> 00:31:33.246]  Stone couldn't bring into evidence that they admitted that they had no proof of a Russian act.
[00:31:33.946 --> 00:31:36.307]  The judge said it's not political, it's not about Russians.
[00:31:36.908 --> 00:31:37.968]  You can't bring that in.
[00:31:38.309 --> 00:31:40.950]  It's all about you lying to Congress, which he didn't do.
[00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:45.913]  But then they all make it about Russia and she lets them.
[00:31:47.313 --> 00:31:50.315]  When you sit there and you watch a rigged game,
[00:31:52.662 --> 00:32:04.825]  And you see the things they do, and then the judge has her operatives call for me to be arrested in the Washington Post for her trying to appoint the head of an Obama cabinet position, whose husband was on the Mueller report?
[00:32:08.046 --> 00:32:14.867]  I mean, it's like the Sierra Mala guy is involved in the whole Biden thing, involved in the meetings, running it.
[00:32:16.788 --> 00:32:19.589]  And we're not supposed to say his name, we're supposed to just let him take down the president.
[00:32:19.849 --> 00:32:20.829]  These people are sick!
[00:32:22.443 --> 00:32:28.844]  As soon as Congress demanded he testify, they first leaned on big tech to censor anybody that said his name.
[00:32:30.925 --> 00:32:34.465]  And now he says, actually I'm not a whistleblower, actually I didn't hear anything, I heard it third hand.
[00:32:34.985 --> 00:32:37.246]  Oh, will they get indicted for lying?
[00:32:38.506 --> 00:32:39.566]  Will they get indicted?
[00:32:39.706 --> 00:32:42.747]  No, no, no, no, no, it's just Roger Stone.
[00:32:44.187 --> 00:32:48.368]  They want to put him in prison if he gets convicted of all six counts for as long as
[00:32:50.459 --> 00:32:50.899]  55 years.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.603]  And in federal prison, that's about 50 years you'll serve.
[00:32:54.665 --> 00:32:55.286]  He's almost 70.
[00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:59.292]  And they're gunning for me, folks.
[00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:01.135]  They tried to set me up with fake Russian stuff.
[00:33:01.376 --> 00:33:02.778]  They tried to set me up with child porn.
[00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:04.716]  Thank God nobody buys it.
[00:33:04.736 --> 00:33:05.577]  Let's go to Joe Biggs.
[00:33:05.957 --> 00:33:07.238]  Joe, you were inside there.
[00:33:07.298 --> 00:33:08.500]  You witnessed all of this.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.103]  You were on fire last night when I talked to you, just rattling off everything that happened.
[00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:14.405]  Then I talked to other reporters.
[00:33:14.445 --> 00:33:15.686]  They confirmed what you were saying.
[00:33:18.009 --> 00:33:22.433]  Let's talk about what happened in there, and then let's talk about what's going to happen if he is convicted.
[00:33:22.693 --> 00:33:24.675]  The operation Free Roger Stone.
[00:33:26.246 --> 00:33:36.516]  Well, it's one of the interesting things, too, that I've noticed that I've really picked up on inside the courtroom when listening to the prosecution is just the condescending attitude towards our president.
[00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:39.799]  Whenever they bring up President Trump, they call him Trump.
[00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:40.960]  They call him
[00:33:41.741 --> 00:33:44.886]  They never want to ever call him POTUS and never want to call him president.
[00:33:44.906 --> 00:33:51.375]  It's just, uh, when he does this, when he's talked to Trump, when he's done this, like they never give the respect that this man deserves.
[00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:56.663]  He won an election against a rigged system, and now we have this party that is still
[00:33:57.183 --> 00:33:59.225]  Doing everything they can to go after this man.
[00:33:59.305 --> 00:33:59.545]  Why?
[00:33:59.585 --> 00:34:01.967]  Because he simply wants to make the country great.
[00:34:02.307 --> 00:34:05.249]  And everything that he's done that's been good, they try to demonize it.
[00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:06.170]  They try to flip it on him.
[00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.171]  He wants to call out corruption from the Bidens.
[00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:09.152]  What are they doing now?
[00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:10.593]  They have these impeachment hearings.
[00:34:10.633 --> 00:34:13.215]  They want to call out the corruption of Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:13.435 --> 00:34:15.757]  Then we have this whole entire Russian investigation.
[00:34:16.097 --> 00:34:17.838]  It's all complete and total BS.
[00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:18.639]  They're pandering.
[00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:19.620]  They're pushing everything off.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.541]  But they just have no respect.
[00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:22.482]  There's no respect.
[00:34:22.882 --> 00:34:25.584]  From anybody in this town for our president.
[00:34:25.805 --> 00:34:28.307]  And it's sad because he's been doing a damn amazing job.
[00:34:28.607 --> 00:34:33.031]  And it's sad to see someone like Roger Stone, such a stand-up guy, to be out here.
[00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.032]  He's dedicated his life to serving this country.
[00:34:35.332 --> 00:34:36.834]  To see people walk all over him.
[00:34:37.034 --> 00:34:46.001]  To throw him under the bus because he simply supports a man that he knew from day one, years ago, would have the best chance of saving this country.
[00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:47.963]  And it's just sad to see this kind of stuff happen.
[00:34:49.278 --> 00:34:55.786]  Well, they know that Roger knows all of Trump's secrets, and I think if they squeeze him hard enough, he'll make something up.
[00:34:56.767 --> 00:35:03.935]  And they're also, again, mad that he advised the President very, very successfully, and that Trump was talking to him basically every day, sometimes for hours.
[00:35:04.756 --> 00:35:08.739]  And that he was just as important as Steve Bannon or others in the White House.
[00:35:09.459 --> 00:35:20.486]  And then when they opened the fake Russia investigation into Stone, remember for over a year and a half before he got indicted, that's when Trump wouldn't talk to him anymore because his lawyers said, oh, don't talk to him.
[00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:22.247]  They'll think you're obstructing.
[00:35:22.588 --> 00:35:27.531]  So that's how they paralyzed Trump from any of his support base.
[00:35:27.691 --> 00:35:29.652]  And now they've moved on to Ukraine.
[00:35:29.992 --> 00:35:31.473]  And there's got to be some pushback here.
[00:35:31.493 --> 00:35:32.434]  They've got to get in trouble.
[00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:37.164]  Yeah, I mean, anyone who supported this president has been guilty from day one.
[00:35:37.464 --> 00:35:41.148]  They've already found him, he's the bad guy, and now they're creating...
[00:35:41.983 --> 00:35:43.084]  These, uh, these issues.
[00:35:43.104 --> 00:35:47.126]  They're creating these crimes and then they're trying to backtrack to find proof to something.
[00:35:47.387 --> 00:35:53.191]  And then if they stumble upon something along the way, then that's when the whole narrative change and it switches from one thing to the next.
[00:35:53.511 --> 00:35:56.313]  But they're simply trying to find him on anything they can.
[00:35:56.333 --> 00:36:00.836]  They need just whatever dirt they can, but the guy is doing an amazing job and they just can't do it.
[00:36:01.136 --> 00:36:02.817]  And Teflon Don keeps shooting them down.
[00:36:03.117 --> 00:36:07.500]  You know, but it's sad to see people like Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, they're going to have to take the fall.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.703]  Um, what we're seeing right now, uh, Michael Flynn, his case might get thrown out.
[00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:13.024]  What is it like for you?
[00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:43.343]  Joe, who they've deplatformed.
[00:36:43.783 --> 00:36:45.164]  You know, you're a soldier, you're a veteran.
[00:36:45.544 --> 00:36:46.224]  We're not wimps.
[00:36:46.264 --> 00:36:55.511]  We expect to get attacked, but to watch the persecution, the crimes that all of us have gone through, to be physically attacked, and then if you fight back, you get sent to prison.
[00:36:56.151 --> 00:37:03.456]  And to see the arrogance of these people never getting in trouble, being caught in criminal hoax after criminal hoax after criminal hoax.
[00:37:03.496 --> 00:37:08.780]  But I think it's coming to the end, even when AP calls the fake impeachment a scam,
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:20.307]  And the witnesses all go, I just heard it third or fourth hand and now they admit there is no original whistleblower because no one wants to say they heard what they heard because it didn't happen.
[00:37:20.387 --> 00:37:21.727]  That is incredible.
[00:37:21.767 --> 00:37:25.830]  But Chris Wallace says it was stunning and powerful and Trump's in trouble.
[00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.492]  And then to watch people defending the hoax.
[00:37:29.432 --> 00:37:31.173]  I mean, I'm just wondering where all this goes.
[00:37:31.233 --> 00:37:32.114]  It's insane.
[00:37:32.134 --> 00:37:37.597]  I mean, you know what they say, you know, this kind of stuff happens to people that can handle it.
[00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:48.136]  And I see right now the people that we have, the president that we have, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, you know, Jacob Bingle, all these guys here with me right now, Enrique Tarrio.
[00:37:48.156 --> 00:37:49.377]  I mean, we can take this on.
[00:37:49.417 --> 00:37:50.397]  We can take being banned.
[00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:52.859]  We can take being censored and all that.
[00:37:52.919 --> 00:37:56.982]  We can stand up against it and continue to fight and continue to move forward, just like you've done.
[00:37:57.282 --> 00:38:00.284]  You know, you've been banned everywhere as well, and you're continuing to fight on.
[00:38:00.624 --> 00:38:03.807]  And we're the people that are meant to be here to deal with this fight.
[00:38:03.927 --> 00:38:05.768]  And luckily, I believe we'll come out on top.
[00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:07.632]  We're gonna have a few speed bumps on the way.
[00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.036]  We're gonna have to keep our head held high.
[00:38:09.317 --> 00:38:12.066]  But I think at the end, we will come out victorious and we will win.
[00:38:12.687 --> 00:38:13.550]  Well, you just said it.
[00:38:15.387 --> 00:38:22.809]  That, you know, God literally has chosen all of us, the listeners, the viewers, this family, whoever raised color and creed to bleed red blood for this moment.
[00:38:23.189 --> 00:38:30.451]  The globalists in Hollywood and the trillions of stolen dollars, they all believe they're invincible because they have the mainstream media, they have the money.
[00:38:30.651 --> 00:38:33.892]  But all of that's crap once the people don't believe their lies anymore.
[00:38:34.172 --> 00:38:36.193]  And I believe we've already reached that tipping point.
[00:38:36.633 --> 00:38:41.074]  And Epstein blew a giant hole in their ship of lies, and they're sinking.
[00:38:41.474 --> 00:38:42.674]  And that's not wishful thinking.
[00:38:42.714 --> 00:38:43.415]  They're sinking.
[00:38:43.455 --> 00:38:44.135]  Here's the problem.
[00:38:44.926 --> 00:38:46.506]  They're trying to take us down with them.
[00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:55.309]  So if we don't have maximum effort here, it's like Gandalf when he knocks the Borag off the cliff, but the Borag puts the whip up and grabs us by the leg.
[00:38:55.649 --> 00:38:59.190]  We need to be looking for that so that we don't get taken down with it.
[00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.850]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.890]  I get chills when I say it.
[00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.230]  Yes, we're winning!
[00:39:02.671 --> 00:39:06.011]  But we've got to be maximum engaged here or they're going to take us down with them!
[00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:08.252]  And I mean the whole damn planet, Joe!
[00:39:09.278 --> 00:39:14.062]  Look at these young men and women right now that are standing up in their states and their districts and they're running for Congress.
[00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:19.506]  The first speed bump that you have in doing that is just getting over that fear, can I do it?
[00:39:19.806 --> 00:39:20.987]  And going to do it in the paperwork.
[00:39:21.007 --> 00:39:29.513]  You've got Enrique here, we've got Laura Loomer, we've got Catalina Hoffman, we've got all these different people all over the country right now standing up and saying, you know what, I can make a difference.
[00:39:29.553 --> 00:39:32.856]  I'm part of this generation right now that's had everything thrown at it.
[00:39:33.076 --> 00:39:34.437]  We've been banished everywhere.
[00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:36.038]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you.
[00:39:36.058 --> 00:39:36.618]  Two minute break.
[00:39:36.779 --> 00:39:38.300]  I want to come back to you Joe, you're absolutely right.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:44.544]  Again, if it wasn't for all these ragtag reporters, folks, we wouldn't know what's going on in that courtroom.
[00:39:44.824 --> 00:39:46.365]  Instead, the media's lies would just win.
[00:39:46.405 --> 00:39:47.926]  But you're getting the truth.
[00:39:48.246 --> 00:39:49.107]  You're getting the reality.
[00:39:49.127 --> 00:39:53.010]  We bust our ass to not exaggerate, but to bring you what's really going on.
[00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:58.373]  And everybody's starting to see that no matter how crazy the stuff is I've talked about in our guest tab, it's all real, folks.
[00:39:58.874 --> 00:40:00.995]  It's all real, except it's worse than we said.
[00:40:01.035 --> 00:40:03.137]  In fact, we have, we have stirred you wrong.
[00:40:04.011 --> 00:40:05.393]  We, it's worse than we thought.
[00:40:06.073 --> 00:40:06.814]  And you know that, too.
[00:40:07.034 --> 00:40:07.755]  We're all in this together.
[00:40:07.775 --> 00:40:08.776]  We'll come right back with Joe Beggs.
[00:40:09.217 --> 00:40:11.179]  Please don't forget, I barely haven't plugged the shower.
[00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:13.541]  Without you supporting us financially, they will win.
[00:40:13.581 --> 00:40:14.823]  And it is hit or miss right now.
[00:40:15.343 --> 00:40:16.104]  Everything counts.
[00:40:16.244 --> 00:40:19.527]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[00:40:19.868 --> 00:40:22.391]  We have the new big Black Friday sales here.
[00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:24.232]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points.
[00:40:24.293 --> 00:40:25.153]  And we have the new
[00:40:26.094 --> 00:40:37.022]  Super silver whitening toothpaste with the patented nano silver and the above sea coral calcium that re-mineralizes the teeth.
[00:40:38.563 --> 00:40:39.684]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:42.466 --> 00:40:43.567]  Joe Biggs is our guest.
[00:40:43.647 --> 00:40:47.549]  I'm going to talk about the real nature of the fight and where we are when we come back in the next segment.
[00:40:47.629 --> 00:40:49.491]  And I'm going to open the phones up throughout the broadcast.
[00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:51.132]  Paul Watson's going to host the fourth hour.
[00:40:52.753 --> 00:40:53.654]  So much is happening.
[00:40:53.694 --> 00:40:55.215]  So much is unfolding that
[00:40:58.339 --> 00:41:00.881]  You've just got my commitment that I'm going to turn the heat up even more.
[00:41:00.921 --> 00:41:05.884]  And we tend to get negative about how corrupt the globalists are, but we're forcing that all out in the open.
[00:41:06.504 --> 00:41:08.305]  But Joe, I want to talk about this.
[00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:20.433]  The judge has really intimidated everybody and really threatened and we know is going to absolutely, once she gets this guilty verdict, throw the book at Stone.
[00:41:21.906 --> 00:41:29.571]  They've telegraphed to Stone if he just doesn't respond and rolls over to their fake trial, that they might not give him the whole 50-something years.
[00:41:31.012 --> 00:41:36.655]  But we are going to have to stand up for Stone, and we're going to have to speak up for Stone.
[00:41:37.676 --> 00:41:41.598]  And as soon as I was making some calls this morning, people were like, well, we don't want to get Stone in trouble.
[00:41:42.118 --> 00:41:43.599]  We don't want to get in trouble with this judge.
[00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:45.140]  This judge is not God, folks.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.842]  She called for my arrest last week, and then the whole...
[00:41:48.626 --> 00:41:53.827]  The law profession said no, what he did is totally legal, and this is dangerous to have a judge saying you can't question jurors.
[00:41:54.107 --> 00:41:55.148]  Juror info is public.
[00:41:55.748 --> 00:41:56.048]  Okay?
[00:41:56.148 --> 00:41:57.888]  Doesn't matter if MSNBC says it isn't.
[00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:03.370]  But I can tell people that this is what Roger's wishes are.
[00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.631]  And so it's not just me up here coming up with a plan, free Roger Stone.
[00:42:09.491 --> 00:42:16.153]  That's Roger's right, if he's wrongfully convicted, because you watch the media, you'll say it's not, to call for the president to pardon him.
[00:42:16.753 --> 00:42:19.555]  And he helped get Sheriff Arpaio a pardon.
[00:42:19.595 --> 00:42:19.975]  We did.
[00:42:20.035 --> 00:42:24.898]  And Arpaio came on and thanked us and said the President said he learned about it from M4s and Roger Stone.
[00:42:25.138 --> 00:42:31.401]  He didn't know that a judge had found Arpaio guilty, wouldn't let him have a jury trial, was going to put him in jail for seven years for contempt.
[00:42:32.962 --> 00:42:35.844]  So that channel between Trump and Stone is so important.
[00:42:36.874 --> 00:42:39.595]  And it's ongoing because of the Secret Service and others.
[00:42:39.655 --> 00:42:44.156]  But just going back to Joe Biggs, Joe, obviously you've been let in on the plan.
[00:42:45.036 --> 00:42:53.258]  And if and when he is convicted, which I would expect to be this afternoon or tomorrow, it's good news the longer they're out.
[00:42:53.278 --> 00:42:54.418]  They've been out three hours now.
[00:42:55.018 --> 00:42:58.599]  We need everyone to go to the White House and surround it for days.
[00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:04.861]  We need more and more people to come there for due process and for justice and to say and to chant, free Roger Stone.
[00:43:05.701 --> 00:43:06.401]  Your comments on that?
[00:43:07.728 --> 00:43:08.068]  I agree 100%.
[00:43:08.688 --> 00:43:10.309]  I mean, that's something that should definitely be done.
[00:43:10.729 --> 00:43:14.149]  And like I said, the outcome of this shouldn't deter people from continuing to fight.
[00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.850]  Right now, that means we need to push harder.
[00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:17.050]  We need to fight back harder.
[00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:18.870]  We need to make our voices louder.
[00:43:19.111 --> 00:43:20.331]  We need to go out here in the streets.
[00:43:20.351 --> 00:43:21.451]  We need to do more videos.
[00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:22.731]  We need to expose more corruption.
[00:43:23.552 --> 00:43:30.053]  The work that you guys are doing, Project Veritas, all of us out here are coming together to expose this cancerous
[00:43:30.475 --> 00:43:30.916]  We're good.
[00:43:46.136 --> 00:43:50.359]  And the character of Roger, um, have these kind of people around him that care about him.
[00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:52.080]  It shows you what kind of a good man he is.
[00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:58.305]  And when you see the amount of people that are standing up for our president right now, through everything, it shows you that we're doing the right thing.
[00:43:58.385 --> 00:44:07.931]  So, you know, right now, as dark as this looks in this time, um, we still need to just push through, track through, and continue kicking ass.
[00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:09.613]  And I think that's something that we're gonna have to do.
[00:44:09.873 --> 00:44:11.634]  And we're not doing it for ourselves, we're doing it for Roger.
[00:44:11.674 --> 00:44:14.336]  He wants to see us continue to take down these people.
[00:44:16.345 --> 00:44:24.810]  Well, Jacob Engels and others are going to be joining us later, and as soon as the trial's over, we're going to be able to really unload on just how rigged this was.
[00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.472]  I've been asked not to get to it yet by a lot of parties, obviously.
[00:44:28.652 --> 00:44:29.772]  People very close to Roger.
[00:44:30.032 --> 00:44:30.673]  Very close.
[00:44:32.033 --> 00:44:39.878]  And it's just, it's truly been a three-ring circus, but I think that's the silver lining here, and I'm not just making lemonade out of lemons here, Joe.
[00:44:40.987 --> 00:44:42.188]  They convicted an innocent man.
[00:44:42.228 --> 00:44:44.409]  They put the president's confidant in jail.
[00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:48.332]  That's a message to everybody that we've got to fight even harder and it shows what tyrants they are.
[00:44:48.672 --> 00:44:50.093]  They think this intimidates us.
[00:44:50.514 --> 00:44:52.055]  I know this just makes all of us fight harder.
[00:44:53.735 --> 00:44:57.637]  Well, you know, you take the most flack when you're over the target, and right now we're taking a whole lot of flack.
[00:44:58.137 --> 00:45:01.519]  God bless you, Joe Biggs at Prespeech.tv with the great Gavin McGinnis.
[00:45:01.539 --> 00:45:01.899]  Thank you.
[00:45:01.919 --> 00:45:02.699]  Please check in with us.
[00:45:03.039 --> 00:45:07.381]  The minute that verdict comes out, you just, any show we've got going, buddy, you call us.
[00:45:07.401 --> 00:45:07.761]  You're on.
[00:45:07.781 --> 00:45:08.702]  You've got the producer's number.
[00:45:08.742 --> 00:45:09.382]  We love you, Joe.
[00:45:09.662 --> 00:45:11.443]  Can't wait to see you in person again and get dinner.
[00:45:11.883 --> 00:45:12.744]  All right, we'll be right here.
[00:45:12.784 --> 00:45:15.305]  I can't wait to see Stone again and get some dinner, man.
[00:45:15.325 --> 00:45:16.766]  I love the guy more than ever now.
[00:45:16.826 --> 00:45:17.226]  Gosh.
[00:45:20.727 --> 00:45:21.688]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:51.574]  I've got a message to you from Roger Stone who's got a gag ball in his mouth politically right now and who is facing certain conviction in my view any minute now at the hands of a true kangaroo court and the railway that Judge Jackson has built from the federal courthouse directly into federal prison for Donald John Trump's longtime wingman.
[00:45:53.763 --> 00:45:59.067]  And that's who Roger Stone really is, not his chief political advisor.
[00:45:59.107 --> 00:45:59.788]  He's that too.
[00:46:00.308 --> 00:46:01.609]  But he is Trump's wingman.
[00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:09.255]  And that's what you get for being this great president's wingman of 44 years, is solitary confinement.
[00:46:10.256 --> 00:46:11.397]  That's where they put Manafort.
[00:46:12.572 --> 00:46:13.953]  By the way, I know folks that know Manafort.
[00:46:14.053 --> 00:46:18.795]  Smart, tough, won the election for Trump, stopped the delegate theft, wouldn't have Trump without him.
[00:46:19.455 --> 00:46:21.856]  He didn't pay taxes like all these other rich people.
[00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:34.322]  He was offshore and they even had previous waivers from the Justice Department for what he did, but they burned him for the things they routinely do and that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden have done.
[00:46:35.443 --> 00:46:38.344]  But with Stone, he's completely innocent.
[00:46:40.785 --> 00:46:46.029]  And so at the bottom of the hour, I've got Roger's message through me to you.
[00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:50.332]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:46:50.352 --> 00:46:55.496]  I have to be very, very careful about what I say because they'll try to use it to put him in prison longer.
[00:46:56.757 --> 00:47:03.442]  But I obviously have talked to Roger and I'm not going to bow down to these criminals.
[00:47:04.083 --> 00:47:05.464]  We have free speech in this country.
[00:47:05.484 --> 00:47:09.387]  I have consulted more than nine attorneys now
[00:47:10.768 --> 00:47:17.954]  Many of them known as being preeminent when it comes to law, but I don't need them.
[00:47:20.636 --> 00:47:33.807]  I remember in my family law case, the judge gagged my ex-wife, and my lawyers said, that's unconstitutional.
[00:47:34.748 --> 00:47:38.150]  And we didn't try to uphold the gag order, because there's nothing to hide.
[00:47:39.492 --> 00:47:50.342]  I've been around this rodeo a lot and gag orders are not real unless it's children or something like that.
[00:47:52.464 --> 00:47:52.924]  They're not.
[00:47:55.306 --> 00:48:00.210]  This is bigger than Roger Stone and I keep saying that because I don't just want you to have empathy.
[00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:02.833]  I want everybody to understand
[00:48:03.806 --> 00:48:10.611]  This is a skeleton key, a keyhole view into things, a Rosetta Stone, a microcosm of everything.
[00:48:11.811 --> 00:48:14.573]  So I'll talk about a big victory right now before I get into anything negative.
[00:48:16.094 --> 00:48:17.235]  Because the two are bound at the hip.
[00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:32.565]  The fact that that bug-eyed, pencil-neck, central-casting, pedophile aesthetics, I'm not saying he's a pedophile,
[00:48:36.801 --> 00:48:55.131]  Adam Schiff tried to suppress five billion people on terra firma, this planet, the surface of this ball.
[00:48:57.492 --> 00:49:02.455]  The fact that he tried for the last two weeks
[00:49:03.956 --> 00:49:17.340]  Working with big tech and 5 billion internet users out of 7.5 billion people to say you couldn't say or print the name Eric Sierra Mala.
[00:49:22.034 --> 00:49:24.114]  Is, is, is a bird's eye view.
[00:49:24.715 --> 00:49:26.155]  It's a 35,000 foot view.
[00:49:26.575 --> 00:49:27.755]  It's a one inch away view.
[00:49:28.055 --> 00:49:29.676]  It's an electron microscope view.
[00:49:30.116 --> 00:49:31.656]  It's a spectrometer view.
[00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:33.477]  It's a radio telescope view.
[00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.577]  I mean, it's everything.
[00:49:36.797 --> 00:49:38.398]  The chutzpah!
[00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:40.638]  The bravada!
[00:49:45.339 --> 00:49:47.780]  The reckless, beady-eyed,
[00:49:52.537 --> 00:50:12.682]  The hubris, the insolence, the snakiness, the creepiness of this man is incredible.
[00:50:13.983 --> 00:50:19.344]  And all of Big Tech in unison, like a team of horses, trained
[00:50:20.489 --> 00:50:22.551]  You know how hard it is to get two horses to work together?
[00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:28.196]  Three horses, four horses, six horses is about the most you can get pulling a big old carriage.
[00:50:29.577 --> 00:50:32.900]  And boy, those horses have got to be just absolutely the best, totally trained.
[00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:36.864]  They usually have dogs, that's what Dalmatians are, running in their legs to keep them in line.
[00:50:36.884 --> 00:50:39.106]  Bite them if they don't do what they're supposed to.
[00:50:39.907 --> 00:50:40.387]  Whips!
[00:50:40.727 --> 00:50:46.793]  I mean, the fact that they had big tech and the whole corporate media in lockstep
[00:50:48.536 --> 00:50:53.820]  Saying arrest Senator Paul, arrest Don Jr., arrest Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.703]  Oh, they had that about me too, saying Eric Sierra Mala.
[00:50:58.864 --> 00:51:10.213]  When under jurisprudence, common law, federal law, state law, First Amendment, this person supposedly first-hand heard Trump doing something illegal.
[00:51:13.618 --> 00:51:26.730]  And so he wants to challenge anybody, a bookkeeper, a maid, an auto mechanic, a police officer, a factory worker, a farmer, or the President of the United States.
[00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:33.556]  We're all equal when it comes to our damn due process that people have fought for 800 years for.
[00:51:33.576 --> 00:51:33.996]  805 years.
[00:51:42.116 --> 00:51:43.977]  Since Ronnie Meade, since Magna Carta.
[00:51:45.277 --> 00:51:49.958]  That a man's home is his castle, that people have got to have a jury of their peers, that they get to face their accusers.
[00:51:51.859 --> 00:52:06.743]  The fact that they would try to do that and then get the entire media, Fox News included, Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube, banning hundreds of thousands of people that would type his name or AI listening to screams.
[00:52:08.224 --> 00:52:08.804]  It was in the news.
[00:52:10.424 --> 00:52:16.146]  You say his name, they can scan that file instantly when it uploads or when it's complete.
[00:52:16.746 --> 00:52:19.807]  The computer sees his name and takes the video down.
[00:52:21.508 --> 00:52:22.588]  That's AI control.
[00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:23.989]  See, that's why I say it's a Rosetta Stone.
[00:52:24.249 --> 00:52:25.529]  It's all these angles.
[00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:30.411]  It's the AI takeover.
[00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:32.592]  It's them butchering due process.
[00:52:32.672 --> 00:52:35.193]  It's them trying to overthrow an election of the people.
[00:52:35.473 --> 00:52:38.934]  And it's the arrogance of it with a weird beady-eyed snake.
[00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:43.105]  Looks like the snake from Jungle Book trying to hypnotize us.
[00:52:46.366 --> 00:52:48.067]  You wouldn't buy a used car from that guy.
[00:52:48.127 --> 00:52:49.528]  You wouldn't have dinner with that guy.
[00:52:49.888 --> 00:52:52.029]  You wouldn't go fishing with Schiff.
[00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:53.910]  You wouldn't turn your back on him.
[00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.711]  I mean, that guy looks like a pedophile.
[00:52:56.771 --> 00:52:57.792]  Just like Ryan Stelter.
[00:52:58.212 --> 00:52:59.273]  And most of them up there are.
[00:52:59.293 --> 00:53:01.514]  I mean, hell, you can't swing a stick and not hit one.
[00:53:01.574 --> 00:53:02.594]  Everybody sees that now.
[00:53:03.015 --> 00:53:03.635]  It's a cult!
[00:53:07.077 --> 00:53:08.497]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[00:53:08.537 --> 00:53:09.478]  He just looks like a...
[00:53:11.539 --> 00:53:12.940]  Evil pedophile.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:13.880]  Now, sorry.
[00:53:15.341 --> 00:53:17.423]  What he is doing is raping our due process.
[00:53:18.303 --> 00:53:21.125]  And then Rand Paul last week's like, well, I'll say his name if I want to.
[00:53:21.145 --> 00:53:22.285]  That's totally legal and awful.
[00:53:23.046 --> 00:53:24.567]  They all freak out and flap their wings.
[00:53:24.687 --> 00:53:26.128]  And then Rand Paul releases it.
[00:53:26.748 --> 00:53:30.991]  And now everybody's saying the name like Jeffrey Epstein, and they don't know what to do, and they're freaking out even more.
[00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:34.192]  And it's just so good to see their bluff called.
[00:53:34.993 --> 00:53:39.976]  But at one level, I'm like, how the hell did they almost complete that?
[00:53:41.567 --> 00:53:44.429]  How did they have my phone ringing off the hook?
[00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:47.731]  No, and you release the name of the whistleblower, you could get arrested.
[00:53:51.754 --> 00:53:54.656]  Or you release the name of a juror and try to tamper them?
[00:53:54.696 --> 00:53:56.017]  I'm like, I didn't try to tamper!
[00:53:57.318 --> 00:54:00.760]  The woman's husband instead worked for Mueller on the damn probe!
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.102]  Of course this woman can't be on the jury!
[00:54:04.303 --> 00:54:07.085]  My exposing corruption is not corruption!
[00:54:08.582 --> 00:54:09.522]  I am not corrupt.
[00:54:09.682 --> 00:54:10.843]  I don't like corruption.
[00:54:11.383 --> 00:54:12.303]  I can't stand it.
[00:54:13.703 --> 00:54:16.264]  It's like I don't like finding a cockroach in my dinner.
[00:54:20.045 --> 00:54:21.125]  I don't like it.
[00:54:22.405 --> 00:54:24.165]  And all these globalists, they love it.
[00:54:24.185 --> 00:54:25.466]  So we'll play those clips when we come back.
[00:54:25.526 --> 00:54:27.926]  But, part of me feels good.
[00:54:27.986 --> 00:54:29.387]  Hey, this whole thing's collapsing.
[00:54:29.407 --> 00:54:35.288]  But we let them get that far and big tech and the media are in such lockstep, like robots.
[00:54:36.323 --> 00:54:47.912]  That when they say, don't show a Taiwanese flag, don't cover their peace movements, don't show Alex Jones' name in a positive mention, the fact that Zuckerberg tells people you'll only talk bad about him, like he's some damn cult leader?
[00:54:48.253 --> 00:54:51.615]  If he was out in a farmhouse with 20 followers, he'd be in a nut house!
[00:54:51.835 --> 00:54:53.937]  But because he has all the control, he's God!
[00:54:54.418 --> 00:55:04.506]  Yeah, old Adam Schiff is big buddies with Ed Buck, the guy indicted for all the folks that are dying over there from meth overdoses at his house.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.426]  They're a real, real couple there.
[00:55:11.018 --> 00:55:18.360]  And that's the guy that just has that demonic energy to always double down and always put out bigger hoaxes and bigger lies.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:29.943]  And so after telling the world, you can't say the name of the whistleblower that first-hand heard Trump commit the crime, even though all the other witnesses, including those hostile to the President, say the same thing that was in the transcripts.
[00:55:30.423 --> 00:55:33.904]  But Chris Wallace and Fox News and others just, oh, it's bombshell!
[00:55:34.124 --> 00:55:37.445]  Did you hear the voice of that ambassador, like Edward R. Murrow?
[00:55:40.455 --> 00:55:41.976]  But even AP calls it a scam.
[00:55:42.216 --> 00:55:43.376]  They just say there's nothing there.
[00:55:44.857 --> 00:55:57.843]  Because you flush Trump and Roger Stone and Alex Jones down the toilet, even if you hate us, you're flushing your own due process and your own rights down the toilet.
[00:55:58.523 --> 00:56:02.545]  Oh yeah, now they're calling the death of these black men sacrifices.
[00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:06.646]  Put that headline back up for folks.
[00:56:06.686 --> 00:56:09.848]  Rolling Stone, The Witnesses, calling it
[00:56:11.502 --> 00:56:15.523]  Bizarre Sacrifice Parties at Ed Buck's Meth Mansion.
[00:56:17.223 --> 00:56:24.165]  Feds Probe Adam Schiff Dressed Like Egyptian at Bizarre Sacrifice Parties at Ed Buck's Meth Mansion.
[00:56:24.185 --> 00:56:24.665]  14 hours ago.
[00:56:24.725 --> 00:56:26.846]  See, I didn't even know that.
[00:56:28.186 --> 00:56:28.946]  That's true pundit.
[00:56:29.466 --> 00:56:31.227]  And Rolling Stone has an article about it as well.
[00:56:31.647 --> 00:56:34.927]  I didn't even know that and I was telling you that he's a devil worshipping pedophile.
[00:56:35.207 --> 00:56:35.808]  Of course he is.
[00:56:35.828 --> 00:56:36.828]  Just look at the man.
[00:56:37.068 --> 00:56:37.468]  My God.
[00:56:39.878 --> 00:56:41.358]  You're not in the club unless you are.
[00:56:41.459 --> 00:56:47.320]  I mean, my God, they put out Twitter ads, the lawyer and the whistleblower, saying, I'll get pedophiles national security clearances.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.121]  I love to go to water parks by myself.
[00:56:49.161 --> 00:56:50.381]  Here I am with little kids behind me.
[00:56:50.621 --> 00:56:51.682]  I love to go to Disney World.
[00:56:51.962 --> 00:56:53.622]  Oh my gosh, I love prepubescent girls!
[00:56:53.642 --> 00:56:56.023]  And I like Jeffrey Epstein!
[00:56:56.323 --> 00:56:58.324]  I'd be proud to be associated with Jeffrey Epstein!
[00:56:58.784 --> 00:57:01.565]  When they'd busted his island and put him back in prison!
[00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:12.825]  Oh, but they want you to show how tolerant you are and have federally funded big fat man in a clown outfit time with your kid.
[00:57:12.865 --> 00:57:14.126]  They call it drag queen story time.
[00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:20.091]  So that's who these boys are.
[00:57:22.432 --> 00:57:28.738]  And it's in the diaries and the reports that Buck was killing people on purpose.
[00:57:31.135 --> 00:57:32.836]  And they would beg and he'd grab them.
[00:57:32.896 --> 00:57:34.736]  He had incredible force, like big black men.
[00:57:34.796 --> 00:57:35.256]  He's a little white.
[00:57:35.276 --> 00:57:44.559]  He would grab and... And he's... I'm liberal!
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.980]  Let me kill you!
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:47.600]  Liberal!
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.741]  Give me your children!
[00:57:48.781 --> 00:57:49.721]  Liberal!
[00:57:53.702 --> 00:57:58.204]  You take one look at Schiff's eyes, that's a demon walking the earth!
[00:58:00.046 --> 00:58:01.567]  And you wonder why it doesn't stop?
[00:58:02.147 --> 00:58:03.968]  Why it lies constantly?
[00:58:04.208 --> 00:58:05.509]  That's what demons do!
[00:58:09.871 --> 00:58:12.312]  And it wants to take full control.
[00:58:16.173 --> 00:58:18.394]  And however they can kill people, they're gonna do it.
[00:58:20.395 --> 00:58:21.376]  Because they want to kill us.
[00:58:23.257 --> 00:58:25.678]  The Bible says they come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:58:31.852 --> 00:58:38.635]  Reportedly, Ed Buck would tackle black men who would cry and beg, crawling away as he would plunge needles into them.
[00:58:40.576 --> 00:58:41.496]  And who's over at his house?
[00:58:43.677 --> 00:58:46.498]  Mr. Schiff, dressed as an Egyptian god.
[00:58:46.518 --> 00:58:53.981]  And I don't know how all this stuff works, but they particularly like to get black people.
[00:58:55.575 --> 00:58:56.795]  Some weird-ass stuff, man.
[00:58:56.815 --> 00:59:00.477]  Hillary and her foundation head got caught shipping all those little black kids out of Haiti.
[00:59:00.517 --> 00:59:01.757]  A bunch of them ended up dead.
[00:59:03.397 --> 00:59:03.918]  Disappeared.
[00:59:03.938 --> 00:59:07.619]  I mean, that's just like... You ever hear a damn word out of Van Jones?
[00:59:07.659 --> 00:59:11.560]  Van Jones knows full well they got a taste for black meat.
[00:59:15.182 --> 00:59:17.403]  They know those devil worshippers want that blood!
[00:59:17.423 --> 00:59:18.824]  They gonna get it!
[00:59:18.844 --> 00:59:21.065]  They're gonna get the black babies too!
[00:59:21.385 --> 00:59:25.066]  And Van Jones ain't gonna say nothin' about it!
[00:59:25.627 --> 00:59:28.788]  Cause he knows where he gets the money from!
[00:59:28.808 --> 00:59:35.451]  So he can point at me and say I'm the racist cause I don't wanna kill the black babies.
[00:59:38.052 --> 00:59:40.013]  And every other damn baby they can get their hands on.
[00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.231]  Remember those Alistair Crowley sex rituals?
[00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:46.652]  They like the walnut sauce.
[00:59:46.712 --> 00:59:48.833]  They want the brown babies.
[00:59:49.074 --> 00:59:49.894]  That's what that is.
[00:59:51.395 --> 00:59:52.675]  And they're gonna get your babies.
[00:59:53.576 --> 00:59:55.017]  And you're gonna like them for it.
[00:59:55.457 --> 00:59:57.238]  Cause they're liberal.
[01:00:00.612 --> 01:00:02.574]  And remember who else dressed up in Egyptian outfits?
[01:00:03.155 --> 01:00:05.136]  Alistair Crowley!
[01:00:05.717 --> 01:00:08.360]  And what do they do in the WikiLeaks?
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.785]  They dress up in the Egyptian outfits and they go and they get them some black people for it.
[01:00:15.606 --> 01:00:18.667]  Because back in the rituals, the pharaohs were getting the Africans.
[01:00:19.508 --> 01:00:21.849]  Pharaohs was some type of weird hybrid group.
[01:00:22.569 --> 01:00:23.490]  Seen those skeletons?
[01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.770]  Don't look too human to me.
[01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:28.612]  And they were killing the black people!
[01:00:28.632 --> 01:00:31.633]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[01:00:33.014 --> 01:00:35.855]  To walnut sauce those black people!
[01:00:38.297 --> 01:00:43.099]  Let's make sure we ban Lady and the Tramp, because... It's racist, but...
[01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:53.228]  You want to dress up like Pharaoh in a, quote, human sacrifice ritual and some black men go out the door dead?
[01:00:53.268 --> 01:00:58.592]  Well, that's all right, because you're Adam Schiff and you got little bug eyes, huh?
[01:00:58.612 --> 01:00:59.352]  Like a snake.
[01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:00.473]  Laser beams.
[01:01:00.633 --> 01:01:02.054]  It's gonna get you.
[01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:04.856]  On target.
[01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:05.937]  Attack, attack, attack.
[01:01:05.957 --> 01:01:07.518]  That's all he does 24-7.
[01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:09.599]  He's gonna get you, America.
[01:01:09.639 --> 01:01:10.840]  He's gonna get your kids.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.141]  Oh, he's gonna get them.
[01:01:13.467 --> 01:01:16.430]  And now he says he doesn't know anything about a whistleblower.
[01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.832]  He's never heard a word of what?
[01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:19.292]  What?
[01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:20.693]  There's no such thing!
[01:01:20.713 --> 01:01:22.535]  You're like, you just lied to my face.
[01:01:23.416 --> 01:01:24.176]  Give me your children.
[01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:26.278]  Give me your children.
[01:01:26.298 --> 01:01:27.719]  I am the chairman.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.260]  Give them to me.
[01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:34.025]  Sorry, I...
[01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:40.654]  Wouldn't it just be better if we let him run the country like he runs California in his own district?
[01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:42.654]  Hundreds of thousands of homeless, total destruction.
[01:01:42.834 --> 01:01:43.815]  You know, why do they do that?
[01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:52.197]  Because when you're one of these things, that's what you like to see is starving people, desperate people, drugged out of their minds.
[01:01:52.638 --> 01:01:54.718]  You like the wavelength, you like the spirit.
[01:01:54.738 --> 01:01:56.499]  You ever been out in California lately?
[01:01:56.519 --> 01:02:00.020]  You just feel empty.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.800]  You want to get out of there?
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.681]  As the plane's coming in, you feel it.
[01:02:03.806 --> 01:02:06.567]  Because it's a big vampire kingdom.
[01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:10.369]  And they're having a lot of fun down there.
[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.690]  With men, women, and children.
[01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:14.351]  Especially the children.
[01:02:14.571 --> 01:02:14.851]  You know what?
[01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:16.672]  Let's go to this clip, because I haven't gotten to the clips yet.
[01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:21.495]  Schiff says he does not know identity of the whistleblower.
[01:02:21.735 --> 01:02:25.637]  So now, Eric Ciramello was the whistleblower, but now he knows nothing.
[01:02:25.677 --> 01:02:25.957]  Here it is.
[01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:44.382]  Just to ask a clarifying question, do you anticipate when we might vote on the ability to have the whistleblower in front of us, something you, of the 435 members of Congress, you are the only member who knows who that individual is, and your staff is the only staff of any member of Congress who's had a chance to talk with that individual.
[01:02:44.882 --> 01:02:45.903]  We would like that opportunity.
[01:02:46.003 --> 01:02:48.465]  When might that happen in this proceeding today?
[01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:51.608]  First, as the gentleman knows, that's a false statement.
[01:02:51.928 --> 01:02:55.951]  I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I'm determined to make sure that identity is protected.
[01:02:56.897 --> 01:03:05.100]  But as I said to Mr. Conaway, you will have an opportunity, after the witnesses testify, to make a motion to subpoena any witness and compel a vote.
[01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:10.342]  By the way, it's known that Eric C. Romella is the final staffer.
[01:03:10.362 --> 01:03:12.083]  They said, hey kid, you're the one caught in the corruption.
[01:03:12.263 --> 01:03:13.464]  You're gonna say you heard it, okay?
[01:03:13.804 --> 01:03:15.044]  Well, just don't say who I am!
[01:03:15.064 --> 01:03:16.145]  I mean, I won't have to testify!
[01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.505]  I'm a little chicken-neck wimp!
[01:03:17.605 --> 01:03:18.486]  I'm CIA!
[01:03:18.706 --> 01:03:19.346]  I'm Rambo!
[01:03:19.446 --> 01:03:19.866]  I'm tough!
[01:03:20.066 --> 01:03:21.827]  I've got a little chicken-neck-like shift!
[01:03:22.167 --> 01:03:24.048]  I'm supposed to rule all these slaves!
[01:03:26.394 --> 01:03:28.135]  We're going to knock the globalists dead.
[01:03:28.155 --> 01:03:34.518]  I can feel the spirit of life and our destiny pouring in to this plane.
[01:03:35.398 --> 01:03:39.520]  This planet is preparing to go to the next level.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:44.582]  There's going to be a long struggle and a long war against Satan's forces.
[01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:48.124]  But I can tell you, I can see the other side.
[01:03:48.544 --> 01:03:52.486]  And we're going to make it through the enemy and leave Satan behind us.
[01:03:53.365 --> 01:03:57.306]  And the hell he's already created as we jump into the future.
[01:03:57.326 --> 01:04:00.527]  Knock them dead.
[01:04:00.547 --> 01:04:03.548]  I am fired up today, boy.
[01:04:04.228 --> 01:04:12.531]  Because their entire impeachment hoax has collapsed into a giant slag heap.
[01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:15.612]  But they're gonna rebuild it again.
[01:04:16.616 --> 01:04:17.617]  That's how globalism works.
[01:04:17.697 --> 01:04:27.188]  Right as their world government AI finally goes live, sometime in the next few decades, maybe even sooner, it will be collapsing from the moment it materializes.
[01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.615]  And so, yes, the fight goes on, and yes, they're going to relaunch again and again, but
[01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:40.348]  The devil worship and satanism of Schiff is coming out in the mainstream news, and Ed Buck, and I'm glad the crew reminded me of that.
[01:04:40.388 --> 01:04:48.195]  I mean, I already know all this stuff, so I'm just up here saying he's a devil, and they're like, yeah, it's in the news, actually, the Aleister Crowley rituals with the black people trying to escape!
[01:04:50.196 --> 01:05:01.245]  And then they got movies like, you know, Get Out, and I'm over there on TI's show in LA, and he's like, you haven't heard about how white people invite blacks over and then kill them and eat them?
[01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:09.855]  And I'm like, well that's not what any Christians do, but see that's why black folks in LA won't even go to a white person's house.
[01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:16.500]  Because they'll kill your ass.
[01:05:18.939 --> 01:05:20.080]  And they're called Democrats.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.542]  They're really called Devil Worshippers.
[01:05:23.262 --> 01:05:26.885]  And you see, folks, I'm saying all this fantastic, crazy stuff, and it's mainstream news!
[01:05:27.325 --> 01:05:29.206]  But it's just back of the paper, okay!
[01:05:29.707 --> 01:05:34.030]  They like to dress up like Egyptians and do rituals, and they call, you know, and black people die!
[01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:36.351]  But it's okay, because he's liberal.
[01:05:37.272 --> 01:05:38.693]  And he's got little bug eyes.
[01:05:41.403 --> 01:05:50.871]  If you pulled up to take your child and check out a highly rated daycare, say your two-year-old daughter or son, and didn't matter how high-rated it was, you walked in and the headmaster walked out and was Adam Schiff.
[01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:52.012]  Looked like Adam Schiff.
[01:05:52.352 --> 01:05:53.092]  Had those eyes.
[01:05:53.673 --> 01:05:58.817]  You'd get creepy crawlies up and down the back of your neck and you'd say, actually, I'm late for a meeting.
[01:05:58.877 --> 01:05:59.418]  I forgot.
[01:05:59.438 --> 01:06:01.239]  I gotta go.
[01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:06.083]  And you would drive out of that parking lot quickly and you'd feel sorry for the kids that were there.
[01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:07.964]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:08.205 --> 01:06:09.686]  You have instincts for a reason.
[01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:12.954]  I was telling T.I.
[01:06:14.074 --> 01:06:16.256]  off air, I said, hey, you're coming in for South by Southwest.
[01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:19.058]  Go over to my house, meet my family, man.
[01:06:19.338 --> 01:06:22.320]  I swear to God, the average white person doesn't want to hurt black people.
[01:06:22.981 --> 01:06:24.962]  He's like, man, I'm not going to any white people's house.
[01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:26.323]  They end up killing us when they're in there.
[01:06:26.863 --> 01:06:28.345]  Haven't you seen Get Out?
[01:06:28.365 --> 01:06:30.386]  And I go, man, that's some leftist Hollywood movie.
[01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:31.947]  That's not really good as well.
[01:06:31.967 --> 01:06:32.888]  That actually does go on.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.202]  You know, you're the one talking about all this occult stuff.
[01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:36.123]  You don't know about this?
[01:06:36.183 --> 01:06:37.564]  How white people get black people?
[01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:39.907]  And I go, well, actually, I do know about the Clintons doing that.
[01:06:39.967 --> 01:06:41.809]  And I do know about the... You keep saying it's Trump.
[01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.151]  Trump's never done that.
[01:06:47.055 --> 01:06:49.498]  But see, that's how crazy all this is.
[01:06:51.192 --> 01:06:57.775]  And then Hollywood knows this type of stuff's going on, and they make a movie about it, but they say the white people want to kill you because they're racist.
[01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:10.461]  No, the white people are killing white people too, and there are some black devil worshippers that get into voodoo and stuff, but you don't really find a lot of black folks, I've studied it, that are kidnapping kids and raping them and having sex with them and stuff.
[01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:12.502]  There seems to be a taboo there.
[01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:18.085]  Now some racist black guys will grab white kids and pour gasoline on them and kill them in Alabama and Michigan and places.
[01:07:18.105 --> 01:07:19.125]  That kind of stuff goes on.
[01:07:21.187 --> 01:07:26.592]  It is true that I've noticed a pattern of black people being targeted by Aleister Crowleyites.
[01:07:27.413 --> 01:07:36.082]  And I've studied a lot of that stuff and I'm gonna go back and research it again and I've got a good idea why they do that but I don't want to say it on air because I need to go refresh my memory.
[01:07:38.164 --> 01:07:43.269]  But see now, now I know why TI was telling me about
[01:07:45.151 --> 01:07:49.956]  Black people getting grabbed up by folks in LA and disappearing because that really goes on.
[01:07:51.718 --> 01:07:54.761]  Now Millie Weaver's gonna be with us for a couple segments coming up next segment.
[01:07:54.841 --> 01:07:56.482]  She's got really big important news.
[01:07:58.384 --> 01:08:02.669]  But I... I'm wound up right now because the Zeitgeist is on fire.
[01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:04.663]  And we're all tuned into it.
[01:08:04.723 --> 01:08:05.884]  Intellectually, I'm excited.
[01:08:06.585 --> 01:08:07.687]  And spiritually, I'm very excited.
[01:08:07.727 --> 01:08:20.885]  You know, people go to a football game, and when they're there and they see their team, they've been fans up for 30 years, win the Super Bowl, and you're on the 50-yard line, and you just feel elated for days, and you're on cloud nine with the endorphins and the adrenaline.
[01:08:20.925 --> 01:08:21.045]  Well...
[01:08:21.986 --> 01:08:44.788]  I'm like that when I see each step of their fraud failing, and I see them failing on every front, it makes me get really, really excited, and makes me thank the good Lord above, my guiding light, and I just want to thank the listeners and the viewers as well, because a lot of bad stuff's going on, but we are pulling away from the globalists.
[01:08:45.837 --> 01:08:50.881]  And humanity is making its decision, and a lot of people are waking up right now.
[01:08:50.941 --> 01:08:54.224]  And it's going to get rough with the AI and other levels of the seduction.
[01:08:54.844 --> 01:08:57.406]  So I don't want to tell people that, you know, we've won this thing yet.
[01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.189]  Like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start doing you know what yet.
[01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:05.513]  But there's not just evil in this universe.
[01:09:05.713 --> 01:09:10.837]  And it's the animating contest of liberty opposing evil that God wants to see.
[01:09:11.578 --> 01:09:13.779]  And it's in that opposition to evil
[01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:25.222]  And it's in the courage to stand against the evil and to go through the fire that you then find enlightenment and fulfillment at levels that are just unbelievable.
[01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:28.623]  I mean, I am so much more fulfilled than I ever was when I was 20 years old.
[01:09:28.883 --> 01:09:30.263]  And I was a very happy, fulfilled person.
[01:09:30.944 --> 01:09:35.045]  And so many people don't feel fulfilled because they're not carrying out their destiny.
[01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:42.298]  If you just take care of your children and I'm a loving good person and stand up for what's right in little ways, you're fulfilling your destiny.
[01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:45.719]  You're not going to be fulfilled carrying out evil and corruption.
[01:09:45.879 --> 01:09:46.620]  It's just that simple.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.261]  So I said I've got a message from Roger Stone to the world.
[01:09:54.602 --> 01:09:57.823]  If I would say when he's convicted by that kangaroo jury, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:02.284]  Maybe God's going to intervene, but pray for Roger and I'll do that.
[01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:06.431]  The jury could come out at any moment, but I'm going to do that at the start of the next hour now.
[01:10:06.451 --> 01:10:07.614]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:10:08.616 --> 01:10:10.280]  Emily Weaver is going to ride shotgun with us some.
[01:10:10.781 --> 01:10:12.304]  The great work she's doing is so amazing.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:21.865]  And that's really only the frustration I have, is there's so much big bombshell stuff happening that it's hard to give any of it the proper coverage it needs.
[01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:41.899]  But Schiff attempting, with corporate media and big tech, to not let you know who the fake whistleblower was, underpinning the entire fake impeachment of the President of the United States, who's trying to restore power back to the Republic and get us on the right direction again, the fact that that's blown up and fallen apart, and that they even tried that, is incredible.
[01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:49.249]  So now they're not going to say that Eric Sierra Malo was the whistleblower.
[01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:58.393]  When I predicted when it came out that it was all just fake and there was nothing there, they just ordered him to say this, that they would suddenly say he was withdrawn.
[01:10:58.413 --> 01:10:59.073]  And that's what's happened.
[01:10:59.093 --> 01:11:00.014]  This is just huge.
[01:11:00.334 --> 01:11:05.136]  And that people understand what's happened, it isn't just some blip we forget in all the fog of war.
[01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:07.037]  It's devastating.
[01:11:07.917 --> 01:11:08.477]  We're going to go to break.
[01:11:08.517 --> 01:11:09.178]  I'm back with Billy Weaver.
[01:11:11.952 --> 01:11:14.334]  Our mission to defeat the globalists is very, very simple.
[01:11:14.594 --> 01:11:20.818]  Study history, understand the enemy's plans, and resist them, and speak out, and have courage, and we'll beat them.
[01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:28.764]  But in the modern realm, and the modern systems, it takes money to fund this thing, and if we had
[01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:48.344]  Twice the money we have, I could radically expand things and absolutely defeat the enemy counter initiatives very, very quickly and easier where I could spend more time getting information out instead of going around just keeping the operation running, which I absolutely hate doing because that distracts my energy from what I really need to be doing.
[01:11:51.363 --> 01:11:54.224]  I'll be out in armored vehicles confronting globalists face-to-face every day.
[01:11:54.284 --> 01:11:56.065]  I'll be doing all sorts of stuff.
[01:11:56.705 --> 01:11:59.786]  So I'm just telling you, listeners, commit today to go to mfolwarestore.com.
[01:11:59.806 --> 01:12:00.686]  We have the big Black Friday.
[01:12:00.726 --> 01:12:01.346]  Sales have begun.
[01:12:02.147 --> 01:12:03.227]  Still store-wide free shipping.
[01:12:03.327 --> 01:12:04.207]  A lot of items sold out.
[01:12:04.227 --> 01:12:05.328]  A lot of new items came in.
[01:12:06.028 --> 01:12:08.809]  Really, one of the best items you should get is DNA Force Plus.
[01:12:08.929 --> 01:12:11.130]  It's back in stock with the PQQ, the CoQ10.
[01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:15.551]  It's 50% off, double Patriot points, and also free shipping.
[01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:20.213]  And what it does for your telomeres and your cells is just everybody should be taking it, especially anybody above 40.
[01:12:20.933 --> 01:12:23.576]  A lot of great Patriot apparel as well at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:12:24.136 --> 01:12:37.149]  And we have the new Above Sea Coral Calcium Toothpaste that also re-mineralizes the teeth and has the patented nano silver in it and is a whitening toothpaste.
[01:12:37.209 --> 01:12:38.230]  It's just amazing.
[01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.172]  InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:12:40.192 --> 01:12:41.533]  It's about to sell out.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.125]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, November 14, 2019 Global Transmission.
[01:12:51.865 --> 01:12:59.572]  Okay, so as a lot of you know, Sunday we had Millie Weaver on and we broke down on the Sunday show.
[01:12:59.832 --> 01:13:04.056]  Eyewitnesses by name had recordings of the Secretary of State's office in Kentucky of
[01:13:07.788 --> 01:13:18.739]  Immigrants who never voted, names being put on the rolls as Democrats and Republicans who lived in other states for eight years being put on there and it being an ongoing problem and the people voting in their names.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.304]  Well since then they've had press conferences with the governor, other witnesses have come forward with the paperwork.
[01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:31.271]  It's massive, 175,000 names put back on the rolls by the Democrats months before giving the election to
[01:13:33.339 --> 01:13:38.303]  The Democrat, the Governor is still contesting, but there's almost no news coverage of this.
[01:13:39.844 --> 01:13:43.687]  Well, Millie Weaver covered it live and streamed it yesterday for Infowars.com.
[01:13:44.247 --> 01:13:45.048]  That's up on the site.
[01:13:46.309 --> 01:13:51.452]  But NBC has responded by saying, and MSNBC, that it's bots.
[01:13:51.592 --> 01:13:56.156]  The bots just went out and said Kentucky was stolen.
[01:13:57.506 --> 01:14:03.955]  Now we've gotten all these documents as well, but see, Millie Weaver's a bot, the Governor's a bot, those recordings of the Secretary of State are bots.
[01:14:04.596 --> 01:14:13.248]  Let's play some of the MSNBC disinformation report, the full report's on InfoWars.com, but they turn you
[01:14:14.582 --> 01:14:21.688]  Like you hear a witch hypothetically can turn somebody into a toadstool or a frog or a toad or a... you know, that doesn't exist.
[01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:33.079]  But the media can turn you, when your identity is stolen by them, by the Democrats, and then they vote in your name, and you catch them, well they just say, you're a bot!
[01:14:33.199 --> 01:14:34.000]  You're a rooski!
[01:14:34.707 --> 01:14:35.107]  Here it is.
[01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:41.253]  ...reporting that last week's election in Kentucky could be a hint of things to come for all of us in 2020.
[01:14:42.234 --> 01:14:56.086]  According to the paper, quote, a few hours after polls closed in Kentucky last Tuesday, a Twitter user posted a message to his 19 followers saying he had just shredded a box of Republican mail-in ballots.
[01:14:56.727 --> 01:15:00.931]  It wasn't true, but that seldom matters on social media anymore.
[01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:05.112]  The Times reports the account does not appear to be from Kentucky.
[01:15:05.592 --> 01:15:07.893]  For starters, Louisville was misspelled.
[01:15:08.333 --> 01:15:10.774]  Twitter has since suspended that account.
[01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:17.556]  Yet the damage has been done and the false claim is still spreading on its own tonight.
[01:15:17.796 --> 01:15:19.076]  Oh no, let's stop right there.
[01:15:19.096 --> 01:15:24.438]  Is it a false claim that Brian Williams said he got shot down in a helicopter by an RPG?
[01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:28.979]  Or that Hillary basically said the same thing about Serbia or Bosnia-Herzegovina?
[01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:49.285]  Remember Brian Williams, and he's back, lying to you, and then what they do is, just like we had real devil worship in Wikileaks, they, the media, focuses on a pizza place, puts out this info, we cover what they're covering, they say it's from us, and then it discredits all the real stuff.
[01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:55.049]  It's the same thing, oh, somebody on Twitter said this that wasn't true, so all the rest of it isn't real.
[01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:58.252]  The damage has been done, Millie.
[01:15:59.932 --> 01:16:00.613]  It's incredible.
[01:16:00.913 --> 01:16:03.615]  Give us the latest on this, you evil bot.
[01:16:05.056 --> 01:16:11.101]  I know, I guess I'm a Russian bot because I'm a journalist that actually looks into allegations of voter fraud.
[01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:23.250]  Well, at the press conference yesterday outside the governor's office in the capital of Kentucky, there was a group that was called Kentucky Citizens for Election Integrity, and they presented evidence
[01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:37.633]  And sworn signed affidavits that a young man who is off to college living in Florida, somehow he ended up voting in the Kentucky election despite the fact that he was over a thousand miles away.
[01:16:37.974 --> 01:16:39.694]  Problem is, he didn't vote.
[01:16:40.094 --> 01:16:45.996]  His mother was the one who discovered that somebody had actually voted for him and signed for him.
[01:16:46.396 --> 01:16:51.597]  When she talked to the poll workers, they said somebody had presented an ID on his behalf
[01:16:51.917 --> 01:16:54.960]  And that's how come his signature was on the form.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.081]  And this is crazy.
[01:16:57.141 --> 01:16:59.063]  This is evidence of voter fraud.
[01:16:59.103 --> 01:17:00.624]  And you know, Alex, it's like with rats.
[01:17:00.684 --> 01:17:03.026]  If you see one, you know there's a lot more.
[01:17:03.446 --> 01:17:11.713]  So we've been seeing floods of people coming and contacting us now saying, look, I checked and I found out I'm also registered.
[01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:13.134]  I lived in Florida for years.
[01:17:13.194 --> 01:17:16.677]  I lived in Indiana, Michigan, wherever for years, Minnesota.
[01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:27.074]  Indiana, I'm being flooded right now, and I'm going to be working with the writers to try to put out a story on all this information that I've been gathering, Alex, but it's so overwhelming.
[01:17:27.094 --> 01:17:29.477]  The information is just coming to us so fast.
[01:17:30.138 --> 01:17:36.526]  We've been in contact with the whistleblower that originally dumped hundreds of documents at our feet on Friday.
[01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:41.152]  And it appears there's a possibility we could even get more information.
[01:17:41.933 --> 01:17:50.658]  There has already been an investigation going on apparently into election voter machine fraud going on in Kentucky.
[01:17:51.018 --> 01:17:54.380]  So we actually have spoken with forensic analysts.
[01:17:55.861 --> 01:17:58.764]  And they've confirmed that there's definitely anomalies.
[01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:07.033]  This is a serious issue and we're just doing everything we can right now to collect as much evidence so that something can be done.
[01:18:07.313 --> 01:18:09.035]  Now what's important to note here
[01:18:10.038 --> 01:18:12.480]  Is that there's a major conflict of interest.
[01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:18.246]  OK, this this company, Harp Enterprises, that owns all the electronic voting machines in Kentucky.
[01:18:18.566 --> 01:18:24.932]  Well, the problem is they also have another company, a shell company in which that same owner is listed as the owner.
[01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:29.416]  He owns all the computer systems that run all of Kentucky's government computers.
[01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:31.657]  That's the problem.
[01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:42.319]  And so the Secretary of State, the county clerks, all the interfaces, and I want to be clear here, Millie, when we found out there was a high-level Obama official on the jury, they confirmed it, then they said we were wrong about the name.
[01:18:42.479 --> 01:18:42.959]  We weren't.
[01:18:43.099 --> 01:18:46.580]  They just put out a fake name of somebody else and said we did that, we didn't do that.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.120]  So they play lots of tricks.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.621]  And so voter fraud is when someone gets the name of a dead person or somebody off the rolls and does it themselves.
[01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:59.462]  This is election fraud, stealing individuals' voters en masse off of lists that
[01:18:59.522 --> 01:19:07.104]  They use of who's registered in another state and so they can then knowingly put those over using the databases for the reverse of what is meant.
[01:19:07.904 --> 01:19:13.366]  Hart Enterprises, Hart InterCivics, all these subcompanies are world famous.
[01:19:13.386 --> 01:19:14.226]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:19:14.606 --> 01:19:16.407]  I've had Bev Harris on probably a hundred times.
[01:19:16.427 --> 01:19:17.027]  You've talked to her.
[01:19:17.047 --> 01:19:18.548]  She's looked at your documents, says they're real.
[01:19:19.148 --> 01:19:20.668]  They're well known for this.
[01:19:21.108 --> 01:19:23.469]  So you're basically telling me that a black cat's black.
[01:19:23.489 --> 01:19:24.789]  You're telling me water is wet.
[01:19:25.289 --> 01:19:26.950]  You're telling me the Easter Bunny doesn't exist.
[01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:28.231]  You're dead on.
[01:19:28.611 --> 01:19:32.315]  And they're just pissed that you've had people come out that were screwed over.
[01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:33.536]  Now there's press conferences.
[01:19:33.596 --> 01:19:35.037]  Now all these witnesses are showing up.
[01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:39.741]  But we can get distracted off into the voting machines and the fraud.
[01:19:39.962 --> 01:19:43.024]  That's ongoing and how easily they can be hacked and how they're designed to.
[01:19:43.064 --> 01:19:43.625]  That's important.
[01:19:44.758 --> 01:20:02.367]  What's totally documented, that you broke with the witnesses and they went public and you had the recordings of the Secretary of State confirming their cases, is people that are Republicans in other states having their names put on the rolls there as Democrats, and their husband that's an immigrant, who's never voted being put on it, as Democrats, and then all these other witnesses.
[01:20:02.828 --> 01:20:08.351]  So it's that 175,000 list the Democrats sued a year ago, had put on one month before the election,
[01:20:09.211 --> 01:20:09.972]  Uh, in October.
[01:20:09.992 --> 01:20:12.655]  Uh, and got that baby in there and have done this.
[01:20:12.695 --> 01:20:13.717]  And that's all they've done!
[01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:22.147]  And the governor's gotta get that list, run it through a database of people that are supposedly off the rolls and live in other states, he'll get way more than 5,000 people, and he'll win the race!
[01:20:22.187 --> 01:20:22.547]  That's it!
[01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:23.048]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:20:24.246 --> 01:20:25.307]  Now here's the problem.
[01:20:25.327 --> 01:20:28.189]  The governor's waiting on a re-canvassing, a recounting.
[01:20:28.489 --> 01:20:36.535]  The problem is the Secretary of State's computer systems, the same company that runs all the machines, they also have access to the computer systems.
[01:20:36.735 --> 01:20:47.623]  So they're essentially asking, we're asking the same company that might have committed this election fraud to investigate themselves and give us the reports to recount themselves.
[01:20:47.663 --> 01:20:48.403]  You're absolutely right.
[01:20:48.503 --> 01:20:52.807]  The Democrats and the company and the software, it's got the modems all between it.
[01:20:53.487 --> 01:20:55.208]  Perfect circle of control.
[01:20:55.228 --> 01:20:58.831]  They're now going to run the recount.
[01:21:00.152 --> 01:21:00.472]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:05.175]  So we're not going to get any justice here unless more whistleblowers come forward.
[01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:19.926]  And the other thing is we're working on analyzing these logs that the whistleblower dumped and seeing if we can pinpoint what the actual voter logs in the machines correlate with with these air gaps and with
[01:21:20.886 --> 01:21:22.407]  I'm good to go.
[01:21:36.957 --> 01:21:42.822]  Judicial Watch sued and got 3 million names in California alone that voted illegally against Trump.
[01:21:43.022 --> 01:21:45.384]  Totally proving everything he said.
[01:21:45.524 --> 01:21:45.944]  2016, 2018, same deal.
[01:21:46.464 --> 01:21:47.025]  Even more numbers.
[01:21:47.365 --> 01:21:48.246]  It's all over the country.
[01:21:48.306 --> 01:21:48.606]  It's total.
[01:21:48.626 --> 01:21:51.488]  We have all the Democrat officials on video saying they engage in this fraud.
[01:21:51.809 --> 01:21:53.050]  We know the machines are doing this.
[01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:54.791]  We all know this information.
[01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:56.392]  And so I'm not poo-pooing what you're saying.
[01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.613]  You've done a great job exposing it.
[01:21:58.314 --> 01:21:59.174]  I'm just wondering
[01:22:00.075 --> 01:22:01.316]  Why the media?
[01:22:01.676 --> 01:22:02.897]  Why the people buy into it?
[01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:04.958]  I guess they don't with Brian Williams that owned fraud.
[01:22:04.978 --> 01:22:09.401]  Not attacking what you said or what you brought forward that's totally true and huge.
[01:22:10.452 --> 01:22:16.394]  But bringing up some little fake thing and not even showing it, to then say it's all a lie, don't look here, don't investigate.
[01:22:16.774 --> 01:22:22.576]  That's really the proof there, is them saying don't look into fraud, when the known fraud of all this is on record.
[01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:25.017]  And the Democrats have, what is it, 14 states?
[01:22:25.498 --> 01:22:27.978]  Where illegal aliens can get driver's license and then vote.
[01:22:28.279 --> 01:22:29.259]  We know what's going on.
[01:22:29.519 --> 01:22:30.579]  California does that.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.780]  Kentucky does that.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.060]  That's what's happening.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.441]  We need voter ID.
[01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:37.182]  Let's come back with Millie Weaver to talk more about this.
[01:22:38.062 --> 01:22:41.986]  On the other side, because there you saw them saying it's all made up.
[01:22:42.086 --> 01:22:44.048]  Brian Williams, he wouldn't lie to you, he told you so.
[01:22:44.348 --> 01:22:47.031]  Think of the nerve of these people relaunching that criminal.
[01:22:49.353 --> 01:22:53.917]  Now look, I've been all over the map with Millie last segment, and I'm not frustrated with her.
[01:22:55.298 --> 01:22:59.022]  I've just done this rodeo over and over again.
[01:23:00.427 --> 01:23:04.931]  And yes, it's big that they got a big tranche of thousands of pages of documents showing all these anomalies.
[01:23:04.951 --> 01:23:07.934]  They show them to Bev Harris, the preeminent crime investigator.
[01:23:07.954 --> 01:23:10.836]  Used to be a federal crimes investigator of big corporations.
[01:23:10.856 --> 01:23:12.578]  You know, the expert on election fraud.
[01:23:12.598 --> 01:23:13.519]  She said, yeah, this looks bad.
[01:23:13.539 --> 01:23:16.021]  I mean, of course we know the name of the company.
[01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:16.762]  It always pops up.
[01:23:16.802 --> 01:23:17.462]  They all do.
[01:23:17.642 --> 01:23:17.742]  Okay.
[01:23:17.782 --> 01:23:18.503]  It's about power.
[01:23:18.543 --> 01:23:19.284]  It's about control.
[01:23:19.344 --> 01:23:20.725]  You've seen how the deep state operates.
[01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:21.546]  They think they're invincible.
[01:23:22.575 --> 01:23:38.346]  I'm saying the names and the first story Millie broke that got everybody interested so they can go look and see that they're on the Kentucky rolls when they've never lived there or haven't lived there in eight years or have never voted and were never on the voter rolls and they're 18 years old or they're an immigrant.
[01:23:39.967 --> 01:23:45.691]  And so people are coming out of the woodwork and they're showing up at the Secretary of State's office and they're coming to press conferences and they're proving it.
[01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:46.892]  They're posting it online.
[01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:49.934]  And Brian Williams is saying it doesn't exist.
[01:23:49.994 --> 01:23:50.395]  It's made up.
[01:23:50.455 --> 01:23:51.195]  It's a Russian bot.
[01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:51.996]  You saw that earlier.
[01:23:54.039 --> 01:23:58.521]  That's a known lying criminal that said he was shot down in a helicopter by an RPG.
[01:23:58.561 --> 01:24:00.062]  So Miller, you're doing a superlative job.
[01:24:00.822 --> 01:24:14.349]  I just haven't ever found a way to capture the public's attention or the government about the election machines and about the fraud and about the same company and about how they're interconnected and control the modems at the county clerk's office to be able to coordinate that.
[01:24:14.409 --> 01:24:15.270]  I get what you're saying.
[01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:16.811]  Yes, I understand that.
[01:24:16.831 --> 01:24:17.391]  You're absolutely right.
[01:24:18.618 --> 01:24:24.544]  But the public can go find out how they're on voting rolls, or their immigrant husband is, and someone's voting in the name.
[01:24:24.664 --> 01:24:29.848]  That's the proof where we can get them, where people experience their identity being stolen.
[01:24:30.469 --> 01:24:34.092]  That's how we're going to get people to start countering this, because there's not enough dead people.
[01:24:34.873 --> 01:24:35.533]  To get it done.
[01:24:36.253 --> 01:24:40.934]  They're going to do it to people in other states, and they're going to put immigrants on it, which they've already done.
[01:24:40.954 --> 01:24:41.834]  That's the Democrat plan.
[01:24:42.075 --> 01:24:58.318]  And I'm saying therein is where we're going to beat them, because people who have their identity stolen legally will be shareholders and will have standing in court when this doesn't get reversed to sue these institutions into oblivion.
[01:24:58.618 --> 01:25:00.398]  And that, I'm telling you, is a real path.
[01:25:00.618 --> 01:25:02.179]  And this gets people's attention.
[01:25:02.199 --> 01:25:02.979]  Does that make sense, Melanie?
[01:25:03.897 --> 01:25:05.438]  Oh yeah, it makes total sense, Alex.
[01:25:05.719 --> 01:25:12.645]  And that's why yesterday, over 100 testimonies have been submitted to the Attorney General's office in Kentucky.
[01:25:12.965 --> 01:25:16.068]  But we know that the Attorney General right now is Andy Beshear.
[01:25:16.448 --> 01:25:19.011]  So how can we expect him to do an investigation
[01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:22.954]  Into himself when he benefits from winning this race.
[01:25:23.794 --> 01:25:26.737]  There's a major conflict, but yes, more and more people are coming forward.
[01:25:26.777 --> 01:25:33.542]  And this young man who's very brave named Jake Bird, who's a college student in Florida, decided he was going to make a video.
[01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:42.469]  He has posted the video of his own testimony that he was not in the state of Kentucky when somebody voted on his behalf, used his ID to do so.
[01:25:42.569 --> 01:25:44.030]  And his mother discovered that.
[01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:46.472]  So that's a major breakthrough right there.
[01:25:46.752 --> 01:25:48.073]  We've had immigrants,
[01:25:48.573 --> 01:25:48.713]  Yeah.
[01:26:08.409 --> 01:26:22.736]  When Open Records requests have been submitted to the Secretary of State's office, they've then deferred to Harp Enterprises and said, oh, well, Harp Enterprises declined that request and they're a private company, so you'd have to subpoena the logs.
[01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:27.919]  So we're being stonewalled here by a bunch of corrupt people in power.
[01:26:27.939 --> 01:26:28.219]  That's right.
[01:26:28.239 --> 01:26:28.939]  It's always the same.
[01:26:28.979 --> 01:26:30.500]  It's a big corporate takeover.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.520]  That's what the new order is.
[01:26:31.821 --> 01:26:33.561]  And then they've got all your private info.
[01:26:33.581 --> 01:26:36.563]  They're in control of the government, but you can't investigate them because they're gone.
[01:26:37.682 --> 01:26:39.226]  And the votes are being tallied.
[01:26:39.506 --> 01:26:44.397]  They're being put up on cloud services that are out of the EU.
[01:26:44.798 --> 01:26:46.642]  So this is foreign interference.
[01:26:47.412 --> 01:26:47.712]  Alex?
[01:26:47.832 --> 01:26:48.553]  Millie, stay there.
[01:26:48.613 --> 01:26:51.694]  I'm going to come back and try to shut up and give you the floor to just recap all your findings.
[01:26:51.794 --> 01:26:53.375]  It just makes my head want to explode.
[01:26:53.395 --> 01:26:54.236]  I get so angry.
[01:26:54.936 --> 01:27:06.662]  Again, if you think Schiff's corrupt folks hiding in plain view, making up fake whistleblowers, saying you can't release their names, now saying there never was a whistleblower, while he's at Ed Buck's house doing satanic ceremonies is being reported.
[01:27:07.062 --> 01:27:10.264]  If you think that's crazy, imagine what we don't know about.
[01:27:10.624 --> 01:27:13.826]  These people have been getting away with literal murder.
[01:27:14.346 --> 01:27:18.548]  And now they want big fat men dressed as clowns to have sexual access to your children.
[01:27:21.689 --> 01:27:28.852]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:27:29.973 --> 01:27:39.237]  You know, they got that movie Field of Dreams where Kevin Costner's walking around and he hears this voice.
[01:27:40.509 --> 01:27:42.130]  Well, I didn't really hear a voice.
[01:27:42.311 --> 01:27:52.139]  I just had a vision of the globalists and what they try to do, the technocracy and the world government, the chi-coms, and the one-child policies, and the breakup of the family, and their whole plan.
[01:27:52.159 --> 01:28:01.848]  About 27 years ago, I just had a compulsion to get involved, and to get into the media, and to make films, and to get on the radio, and to raise the alarm.
[01:28:02.548 --> 01:28:05.611]  And it was God guiding my mind and my steps the entire time.
[01:28:08.237 --> 01:28:09.858]  And boy, I was a sweet boy back then.
[01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:22.309]  I have turned into a vicious ogre-like creature.
[01:28:23.269 --> 01:28:24.070]  But that's okay.
[01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:26.472]  That's God's plan because I'm going after the New World Order.
[01:28:26.872 --> 01:28:29.254]  But I am now completely compelled to fight them.
[01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:32.257]  It's not courage.
[01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:37.061]  It is commitment and just being taken over.
[01:28:38.234 --> 01:28:41.736]  And you have to understand, the enemy is taken over by their evil force.
[01:28:43.497 --> 01:28:48.199]  But I tell you, there's nothing more satisfying than being committed to what you do and knowing it's the right thing.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.920]  It is fulfillment.
[01:28:50.341 --> 01:28:56.264]  And I can tell you, people out there who don't feel good or don't have fulfillment, if you have a relationship with God, you've got it all.
[01:28:56.344 --> 01:28:59.646]  And just look at these articles coming up after Millie Weaver leaves us, and I'm gonna open the phones up.
[01:29:01.787 --> 01:29:07.110]  Feds probe Adam Schiff dressed like Egyptian at bizarre sacrifice parties.
[01:29:09.315 --> 01:29:11.877]  This is all over the news.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.542]  I'm suing him, by the way.
[01:29:17.622 --> 01:29:22.046]  For saying that I'm basically a child molester.
[01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:24.088]  With no proof.
[01:29:24.328 --> 01:29:27.191]  Gotta give all those illegal aliens free housing.
[01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:41.762]  More on Disney putting trigger warnings on outdated movies.
[01:29:41.782 --> 01:29:43.763]  They say they're evil, like Lady and the Tramp.
[01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:49.065]  Another bizarre mainstream article saying the Stone trial is still ongoing.
[01:29:49.225 --> 01:29:50.246]  The jury's out right now.
[01:29:50.266 --> 01:29:50.866]  That's not true.
[01:29:51.746 --> 01:29:53.347]  It says testimony continues on Friday.
[01:29:53.627 --> 01:29:54.968]  No, they rested yesterday.
[01:29:56.268 --> 01:29:56.948]  We're watching that.
[01:29:56.968 --> 01:29:58.049]  I've got my message of Stone.
[01:29:58.089 --> 01:29:59.349]  I'll do that before I go to your calls.
[01:29:59.369 --> 01:30:02.591]  I've already posted an article dealing with it.
[01:30:03.524 --> 01:30:05.686]  I believe he's going to be convicted because it's a kangaroo court.
[01:30:05.706 --> 01:30:06.466]  I'll talk about that.
[01:30:06.866 --> 01:30:12.471]  The toll free number to talk about any of these issues is 877-789-2539.
[01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:13.351]  877-789-Alex.
[01:30:13.912 --> 01:30:18.895]  What do you make of the whole impeachment thing collapsing?
[01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:19.516]  That's the word.
[01:30:19.636 --> 01:30:23.358]  Even mainstream news had those headlines.
[01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:25.600]  Are the Democrats building a collapsible impeachment?
[01:30:26.981 --> 01:30:30.463]  AP calls it a scam.
[01:30:31.945 --> 01:30:32.425]  What are they?
[01:30:35.273 --> 01:30:39.976]  Going to do so much more on that coming up, but going back to Millie Weaver.
[01:30:41.517 --> 01:30:51.985]  Millie, you've done a just amazing job with you and your team in between Ohio and Kentucky and on the road when you're a mother with two Children been working with us 89 years.
[01:30:52.005 --> 01:30:59.030]  So the babies came later, but you and your husband and your camera team and just witnessing
[01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:19.358]  The witnesses and the documents and the state admitting you're right and going and filing the info and meeting the Secretary of State's office, not just on the phone but going there and having press conferences at the governor's office and then to watch Brian Williams not show you, not show what you said so folks could decide just saying you're a bot and then he made up something that wasn't true.
[01:31:19.398 --> 01:31:25.561]  Of course he's Brian Williams but the fact that they're just doing it, what is it like for you to witness it for yourself
[01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:36.386]  To stay up late at night going over all these documents now for four or five days, to have Bev Harris, the top researcher, confirming it, and to just know that that's business as usual.
[01:31:37.427 --> 01:31:39.328]  Well, you know, they're just setting the narrative.
[01:31:39.368 --> 01:31:44.791]  They're getting ready to start the smear campaign because they're anticipating all of this information coming out.
[01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:46.472]  And it will be coming out soon.
[01:31:46.592 --> 01:31:52.555]  And I do believe that this is going to become a national story shortly here when we start to see people being put behind bars.
[01:31:52.935 --> 01:31:55.596]  Okay, and that very well could happen soon, Alex.
[01:31:55.976 --> 01:32:03.659]  And people need to remember, you know, everyone goes up in arms when there's any talk about infringing on our gun rights or taking away our gun rights.
[01:32:03.979 --> 01:32:10.182]  Well, people should be just as concerned, if not more concerned, about taking away our free and fair elections.
[01:32:10.522 --> 01:32:16.404]  Because if we don't have our elections, we don't have the ability to vote for keeping our gun rights.
[01:32:16.944 --> 01:32:19.346]  You know, vote for the rights that we want to maintain.
[01:32:19.586 --> 01:32:23.009]  They'll just take them all from us and they'll say we willingly forfeited them.
[01:32:23.389 --> 01:32:24.370]  So that's what we're up against.
[01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:34.637]  And as far as this impeachment inquiry, well, that's plan A, Alex, but plan B is stealing the election via vote rigging in 2020.
[01:32:35.277 --> 01:32:37.159]  And that's what we're trying to stop right now.
[01:32:37.239 --> 01:32:41.622]  And we are doing all, we're putting all of our resources and effort into investigating this.
[01:32:41.682 --> 01:32:42.903]  We have forensic analysts.
[01:32:43.303 --> 01:32:44.564]  We are going through this data.
[01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:57.335]  We're trying to figure out how we can expose this the proper way without interfering with investigations and to essentially do the most damage to this corrupt system that's stealing Americans votes from them.
[01:32:57.956 --> 01:32:59.137]  It's a major issue.
[01:33:00.138 --> 01:33:10.887]  You can even see it yourself when you go to the Kentucky elections website and you'll when you click on the voter results it'll take you to clarity and that is when you can see that Seidel and these
[01:33:11.584 --> 01:33:21.571]  Foreign software companies, they even stated on the website that those are the companies that are tallying the votes that are being put up in clouds and being put up on servers that are out of Europe.
[01:33:22.192 --> 01:33:24.173]  So how is that not foreign interference?
[01:33:24.754 --> 01:33:38.984]  They want to talk about foreign interference meddling in elections with this Russian story that they investigated for two years against President Trump, when we've heard no mainstream media outlets pick up this story, despite that evidence is coming out.
[01:33:39.685 --> 01:33:40.466]  It's unbelievable.
[01:33:40.506 --> 01:33:48.130]  There was a press conference yesterday where you had this group go over all of this information and the mainstream media has been silent with it.
[01:33:48.411 --> 01:33:58.977]  They only were there to try to bully and interrogate these women that are concerned citizens in Kentucky that have had floods of information of voter fraud coming to them.
[01:33:59.298 --> 01:34:04.661]  They just wanted to try to bully them and shut them down and they didn't even air the press conference.
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:06.542]  Alex, it's unbelievable.
[01:34:06.943 --> 01:34:16.135]  The mainstream media is full of Democrat operatives that are doing the deep states bidding, trying to suppress this information from getting out.
[01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:20.493]  Wow, Millie, powerfully said we're going to put this interview out.
[01:34:20.593 --> 01:34:22.093]  Hopefully you can post it to your YouTube.
[01:34:22.973 --> 01:34:24.454]  But this is just amazing.
[01:34:24.754 --> 01:34:28.875]  And again, you had all those news media there and you had evidence and you had witnesses.
[01:34:28.895 --> 01:34:31.976]  You have people showing how they had been put on the Democrat rolls.
[01:34:33.076 --> 01:34:34.256]  And that is so huge.
[01:34:34.296 --> 01:34:35.837]  Their identities stolen.
[01:34:37.637 --> 01:34:38.837]  And no coverage of it.
[01:34:38.877 --> 01:34:39.557]  But we're here.
[01:34:39.698 --> 01:34:40.278]  We're on air.
[01:34:40.778 --> 01:34:41.618]  We're exposing it.
[01:34:41.638 --> 01:34:42.478]  Thank you so much, Millie.
[01:34:42.518 --> 01:34:43.859]  We will continue to watch your great work.
[01:34:44.919 --> 01:34:45.499]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:34:46.445 --> 01:34:48.566]  It's all at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:34:48.586 --> 01:34:53.568]  She's got her own channel at band.videos, which is backed up there in case any of her other material gets censored.
[01:34:53.628 --> 01:34:56.709]  Alright, 877-789-2539.
[01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:07.974]  You notice that it's InfoWars over and over and over and over again that exposes the Obama department juror whose husband is working on the Mueller probe.
[01:35:08.774 --> 01:35:10.475]  That's textbook conflict of interest.
[01:35:11.095 --> 01:35:12.376]  You notice it's us doing that.
[01:35:12.776 --> 01:35:14.697]  You notice it's us exposing the identity of the whistleblower.
[01:35:15.694 --> 01:35:17.835]  You notice it's us doing it two plus years ago.
[01:35:18.216 --> 01:35:20.017]  You notice it's us exposing the Soros moles.
[01:35:20.357 --> 01:35:21.898]  You notice it's us exposing Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:35:21.918 --> 01:35:23.339]  You notice it's us exposing it all.
[01:35:23.559 --> 01:35:31.304]  Because we do the homework, we are totally focused on this, and we've got all the sources across the country and the world that care about freedom.
[01:35:31.485 --> 01:35:32.765]  They're all over the place.
[01:35:32.785 --> 01:35:34.587]  There's good people everywhere.
[01:35:35.347 --> 01:35:37.448]  But they're trying to put us in prison.
[01:35:37.849 --> 01:35:39.050]  They're trying to bankrupt us.
[01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:48.616]  They want to demonize us, censor us, boycott us, silence us, and then they can set us up and try to put us in prison.
[01:35:50.477 --> 01:35:52.058]  So, it's personal with me.
[01:35:52.218 --> 01:35:57.202]  I want to defeat the globalists for everybody, for all the innocent children, and for all of our futures, and for society.
[01:35:57.222 --> 01:36:00.564]  I mean, it's because it's what God wants, and because evil must be confronted.
[01:36:00.604 --> 01:36:03.366]  That's what this animating contest of consciousness is all about.
[01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:08.292]  But yeah, I want to beat the globalists.
[01:36:08.352 --> 01:36:11.575]  I'm not even scared of what'll happen if they ever get me down.
[01:36:13.396 --> 01:36:20.581]  I'm really worried that I don't have the energy and the focus and the stamina and the will to really do my best.
[01:36:20.661 --> 01:36:23.903]  And I'm constantly chomping at the bit to do more and to stay in the fight.
[01:36:23.923 --> 01:36:32.029]  So I'm just asking viewers and listeners, keep InfoWars in the fight financially and spread the word about our videos and our articles and everything we do.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:42.103]  Because that's how we are going to stay in the game and ensure that the next hundred huge stories we break that devastate the enemy, get out there.
[01:36:42.883 --> 01:36:50.046]  We really have put out half the reports that devastated the NWO.
[01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:52.426]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:36:52.967 --> 01:36:54.187]  And it's because of you backing us.
[01:36:54.207 --> 01:36:59.209]  So you've got the commitment that we're not going to back down, but we'll collapse unless you back us.
[01:36:59.229 --> 01:37:00.349]  So please continue to back us.
[01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:02.090]  HugeSales and FortWorthStore.com.
[01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:02.490]  Take action.
[01:37:03.968 --> 01:37:04.768]  I have a message.
[01:37:05.409 --> 01:37:11.471]  I have a message for the world from Roger Stone.
[01:37:11.491 --> 01:37:21.876]  And that message is, your basic liberties, your basic freedoms and due process is under attack.
[01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:32.501]  And if Roger Stone can be found guilty on any of the six counts against him by this kangaroo court and this Obama-appointed
[01:37:34.011 --> 01:37:39.435]  Tyrant, fake judge, that no one in this nation is safe.
[01:37:40.076 --> 01:37:55.487]  And we see in Congress the fake Star Chamber secret trials where they were having rehearsals on how they would testify, but even once they testified, it turned out that everything that we'd heard from Adam Schiff, Ed Buck's best buddy, was a lie.
[01:37:57.168 --> 01:37:59.350]  So, Roger Stone's message is this.
[01:38:01.018 --> 01:38:02.618]  He expects to be convicted.
[01:38:03.559 --> 01:38:05.579]  He said only a miracle can save him now.
[01:38:05.639 --> 01:38:08.880]  That's his exact words to me last night and this morning.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:21.302]  And he said to me, Alex, barring a miracle, I appeal to God and I appeal to your listeners for prayer.
[01:38:21.322 --> 01:38:28.104]  And I appeal to the president to pardon me
[01:38:29.875 --> 01:38:43.818]  Because to do so would be an action that would show these corrupt courts that they're not going to get away with persecuting people for their free speech or for the crime of getting the president elected.
[01:38:44.938 --> 01:38:51.239]  If we don't do that, it will embolden their criminal activity.
[01:38:52.119 --> 01:38:55.980]  Now there is a press release and an article on newswars.com and infowars.com
[01:39:01.283 --> 01:39:04.845]  That has the number to the White House on it.
[01:39:09.967 --> 01:39:30.696]  And even when he is convicted by this jury, it is vital that everyone share the information graphic posted at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com with everyone you know on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, by hand, you name it, and that everyone
[01:39:31.533 --> 01:39:32.013]  Who can?
[01:39:33.434 --> 01:39:39.258]  In the area of Virginia or Maryland or West Virginia or all over the country, travel to D.C.
[01:39:39.398 --> 01:39:48.503]  anytime for the week after this conviction and encircle the White House with bullhorns demanding President Trump take action.
[01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:59.370]  They have packed the court full of Obama, Hillary appointees and operatives, CIA spooks, you name it.
[01:40:00.814 --> 01:40:04.116]  The jury reportedly has been looking at Roger and shaking with hatred.
[01:40:05.757 --> 01:40:09.800]  And he's done absolutely nothing wrong.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:15.664]  They've put President Trump on trial saying that it came from the Russians with no proof.
[01:40:16.524 --> 01:40:21.728]  They're hoping this show trial and conviction of Stone will somehow claim that Russiagate was real.
[01:40:22.328 --> 01:40:24.690]  But it's already collapsed.
[01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:26.091]  He's not on trial for Russia.
[01:40:26.551 --> 01:40:27.352]  He's on trial for
[01:40:28.254 --> 01:40:31.436]  Supposedly telling Congress he wasn't in direct contact with Julian Assange.
[01:40:32.556 --> 01:40:35.218]  Well, he never was in direct contact with him.
[01:40:35.258 --> 01:40:36.438]  He worked here at the time.
[01:40:36.499 --> 01:40:36.939]  We know.
[01:40:37.979 --> 01:40:40.281]  He was talking to him through people like Credico and others.
[01:40:40.321 --> 01:40:43.522]  And Assange was talking to the mainstream media at that time.
[01:40:43.983 --> 01:40:44.863]  That's not illegal.
[01:40:45.984 --> 01:40:48.825]  But CNN tells you that if you read WikiLeaks, you're going to jail.
[01:40:49.526 --> 01:40:52.427]  They tell you if you say the name of this whistleblower, you're going to jail.
[01:40:52.447 --> 01:40:53.408]  But Rand Paul has.
[01:40:54.721 --> 01:40:57.944]  Because it's the law that when you accuse somebody, your name is public.
[01:40:58.364 --> 01:41:00.726]  But the Democrats are trying to intimidate the world.
[01:41:01.247 --> 01:41:03.509]  Anybody that would support President Trump.
[01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:06.732]  So Roger Stone's message is this.
[01:41:06.992 --> 01:41:11.296]  He prays by a miracle that he's not convicted.
[01:41:11.356 --> 01:41:12.937]  But the tea leaves are clear.
[01:41:12.977 --> 01:41:14.299]  He believes he will be convicted.
[01:41:14.779 --> 01:41:20.184]  They've now been deliberating for five hours or so.
[01:41:23.208 --> 01:41:25.189]  And as soon as the verdict comes out, we'll let you know.
[01:41:25.249 --> 01:41:32.632]  But right now, barring that miracle, he'll be convicted on many of the six fake counts.
[01:41:33.613 --> 01:41:41.036]  And that's why we have a separation of powers, so that when there is misjustice, higher courts can override lower courts and overturn convictions.
[01:41:41.777 --> 01:41:47.499]  And Congress can pass laws that override the courts, or even the executive in many cases.
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:50.901]  An executive has the power of the pardon.
[01:41:52.552 --> 01:41:56.453]  Only an impeachment for what they believe is an improper pardon can stop the president.
[01:41:57.033 --> 01:42:00.555]  And will Americans be mad at Trump if he pardons Stone?
[01:42:02.335 --> 01:42:09.057]  Stone stopped being able to communicate with Trump once they said that Stone and Trump were implicated in the fake Russiagate.
[01:42:09.277 --> 01:42:11.258]  That was meant to break them off from each other.
[01:42:12.418 --> 01:42:13.459]  Now that's been proven to be a hoax.
[01:42:14.656 --> 01:42:18.097]  So will the president listen to his cowardly advisors and not pardon Stone?
[01:42:18.838 --> 01:42:27.361]  Because he believes, if he does, that that somehow validates a Russia connection when this man has not been indicted for Russia connection.
[01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:29.822]  And the judge wouldn't let Stone bring it to his defense.
[01:42:30.828 --> 01:42:32.029]  There was no Russia connection.
[01:42:32.789 --> 01:42:34.410]  She said this trial isn't about Russia.
[01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:37.992]  So you can't bring in that no proof was ever shown that the hack was Russian.
[01:42:38.212 --> 01:42:48.298]  But then the entire prosecution is about Trump and the Russians and Stone and the Russians in front of these jurors and these lip-tarred jurors know damn well he's innocent.
[01:42:49.619 --> 01:42:55.482]  But they want to sit there and feel all officious and powerful and send him to prison hoping for some victory.
[01:42:56.903 --> 01:43:02.608]  against flyover country that they despise so much and they're so angry they don't have control of.
[01:43:03.969 --> 01:43:04.869]  So write down the number.
[01:43:06.170 --> 01:43:22.443]  It's Roger Stone's request that if he's convicted you call the White House 202-456-1414 and you let them know repeatedly that you want this man that got Trump elected and has now been indicted for that crime according to the Deep State.
[01:43:24.165 --> 01:43:25.286]  And I point out in the article that
[01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:35.239]  Kit and I wrote during the breaks at InfoWars.com that if he is found innocent by a miracle,
[01:43:36.573 --> 01:43:40.254]  Still it's good to call the White House and tell the President, indict the Deep State.
[01:43:40.594 --> 01:43:42.875]  Bring out the Inspector General report.
[01:43:43.515 --> 01:43:45.276]  Indict them for the fake Russiagate hoax.
[01:43:45.376 --> 01:43:46.436]  Indict them for their crimes.
[01:43:46.476 --> 01:43:48.297]  Indict them for the fake whistleblower.
[01:43:48.817 --> 01:43:59.541]  But they now have an ongoing impeachment proceedings based on a lie and Schiff says the whistleblower doesn't even know who it is now and he said it was Eric Sierra Mala.
[01:44:00.933 --> 01:44:03.255]  Think about how crazy things have gotten.
[01:44:03.275 --> 01:44:05.177]  Think about how dumb they think you are.
[01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:06.178]  They think you have no memory.
[01:44:06.478 --> 01:44:10.862]  Like Jonathan Gruber said, he wrote Obamacare to triple your prices.
[01:44:10.882 --> 01:44:12.184]  He said, thank God you don't have a memory.
[01:44:13.465 --> 01:44:16.007]  Thank God you're so stupid.
[01:44:16.828 --> 01:44:17.929]  But are you really stupid?
[01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:19.050]  No, you're not stupid.
[01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:21.232]  And it's this audience of activists they fear.
[01:44:22.694 --> 01:44:25.696]  So again, not just one day, but many days.
[01:44:26.630 --> 01:44:39.497]  For due process, for justice, for freedom, and to say no to the Russiagate hoax, and all of the judicial tyranny, and the deep state political prosecutions of political prisoners like Roger Stone, we say no now!
[01:44:40.677 --> 01:44:45.360]  So I'm not waiting until he's convicted to come out here and tell you the battle plan.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.843]  Because I believe he is going to be convicted because of the intel we got from witnesses and reporters.
[01:44:52.697 --> 01:44:55.539]  And I hope I get egg on my face because I rarely do.
[01:44:55.659 --> 01:44:58.180]  I'll be very glad to come on here and say I was wrong.
[01:44:58.461 --> 01:45:02.483]  But I think we all know a kangaroo court fraud when we see it.
[01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:11.668]  They packed that court with deep staters and the benches were just full of globalists cackling and laughing at their petty power.
[01:45:11.949 --> 01:45:12.989]  These people have no power.
[01:45:13.029 --> 01:45:15.531]  They're pumps of the satanic pedophile network.
[01:45:18.752 --> 01:45:20.952]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:45:21.693 --> 01:45:22.733]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:45:22.753 --> 01:45:25.053]  We're going to your phone calls here right now.
[01:45:26.334 --> 01:45:28.314]  And then I'm going to get into some of the other big breaking news.
[01:45:28.374 --> 01:45:29.194]  It's just crazy.
[01:45:29.934 --> 01:45:32.335]  Their whole system of lies is coming down.
[01:45:33.575 --> 01:45:35.796]  The elections, they've been rigging almost all of those.
[01:45:37.696 --> 01:45:41.097]  The establishment has basically just run every scam you can imagine.
[01:45:41.157 --> 01:45:45.418]  The average mortgage has been sold more than 50 times by the big banks over and over again to investors.
[01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:52.096]  Major mutual funds are coming out and warning investors not to buy too many stocks.
[01:45:53.497 --> 01:45:57.001]  They're doing that so they have liability protection when the market crashes.
[01:45:57.021 --> 01:46:05.210]  A lot of listeners are probably, well, that's kind of oxymoronic.
[01:46:06.011 --> 01:46:08.013]  You say you don't want to plunge the stock market.
[01:46:08.814 --> 01:46:13.037]  But then you also get up on air and point out that a lot of it is overinflated.
[01:46:13.557 --> 01:46:17.100]  We're in a global race with the Chai comms devaluing currency.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:18.901]  Donald Trump didn't do that.
[01:46:18.941 --> 01:46:19.581]  I didn't do that.
[01:46:20.962 --> 01:46:26.126]  And if you look at, you know, like Bill Gates was worth $4 billion in 1995.
[01:46:26.226 --> 01:46:31.009]  But that $4 billion then would be about $50 billion today.
[01:46:36.257 --> 01:46:39.580]  The devaluation is happening very, very quickly.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:46.085]  Inflation has been kept at bay partially, but it's out of control in some cities.
[01:46:47.706 --> 01:46:49.907]  And so I don't like fractional reserve banking.
[01:46:49.947 --> 01:46:51.369]  I don't like all the manipulation.
[01:46:52.289 --> 01:46:54.751]  But it's the bubble we live on.
[01:46:56.292 --> 01:46:59.054]  And so the globalists have been trying to pop the U.S.
[01:46:59.094 --> 01:46:59.395]  bubble.
[01:47:00.609 --> 01:47:02.390]  While propping up the Chi-Com bubble.
[01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:07.232]  And so I've been, okay, let's politically get good judges in.
[01:47:07.672 --> 01:47:09.913]  Let's expose the corrupt pedophile regime.
[01:47:10.794 --> 01:47:13.295]  Let's reverse a lot of the New World Order operations, secure the borders.
[01:47:14.516 --> 01:47:22.959]  And then we're gonna have to have a real discussion with Rand Paul and others, who's very fiscally smart, with Trump about being honest with the people about what we're gonna do.
[01:47:26.001 --> 01:47:27.822]  But it's a global system.
[01:47:28.934 --> 01:47:40.684]  And so the private Federal Reserve and the very central banks talking about how the economies and the stock markets overinflated.
[01:47:40.724 --> 01:47:42.185]  They're the very ones that did it.
[01:47:42.205 --> 01:47:49.412]  They're now getting the benefit of doing it, creating all this fiat currency that they used first.
[01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:54.131]  But it had more value, and then they inflate it more, and they use it again when it has more value.
[01:47:54.611 --> 01:47:59.213]  But it's declining value for us, and then they tell us, oh, here's a message to you.
[01:48:00.673 --> 01:48:06.656]  You better watch out, and you better not invest too much in the stock market, young people.
[01:48:08.336 --> 01:48:12.598]  Fidelity warns Boomer generation to stop buying stocks.
[01:48:12.658 --> 01:48:16.639]  A ZeroHedge.com article up on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:48:17.319 --> 01:48:18.540]  And it's just a very important article.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:19.700]  I want to go to your phone calls, but
[01:48:22.363 --> 01:48:24.344]  There's just so much happening, so much unfolding.
[01:48:26.364 --> 01:48:27.304]  Interesting story here.
[01:48:28.865 --> 01:48:32.046]  Amateur astronomer discovers comet ahead of NASA report.
[01:48:32.066 --> 01:48:32.826]  That's from RT.
[01:48:32.846 --> 01:48:34.346]  We posted it up on Forza.com.
[01:48:37.067 --> 01:48:51.131]  Not content with leading NASA to detect water from an alien star system or Bordeaux Nellis Teller visitor, Crimean amateur astronomer Gennady Borzov has discovered another comet.
[01:48:52.585 --> 01:48:57.609]  Dubbed, Two Eye Bores Eyes Off, if I say that right.
[01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:00.852]  A new resident of our solar system.
[01:49:01.032 --> 01:49:02.513]  Now, why is that an important article?
[01:49:02.533 --> 01:49:05.956]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:49:05.976 --> 01:49:17.405]  I, back in college, went in with my dad to buy a 12-inch diameter reflector, refractor, I used to know all this, telescope, but the bigs, you know, they're short and fat.
[01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:21.373]  It had all the computer controls in that when those were first coming out.
[01:49:21.393 --> 01:49:23.936]  And my favorite thing was the black filter you put on it.
[01:49:24.517 --> 01:49:25.238]  You couldn't see through it.
[01:49:25.258 --> 01:49:26.820]  You look at the sun, you could see the sun.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.862]  And you'd go away and have some lemonade or whatever.
[01:49:28.882 --> 01:49:30.784]  Come back an hour later, you'd see sunspots had turned.
[01:49:30.804 --> 01:49:31.726]  You know, the thing's moving.
[01:49:33.247 --> 01:49:33.688]  It's round.
[01:49:36.209 --> 01:49:41.972]  And when I talk to the Flat Earth folks, they say it's like a dome above us, and the sun's just like a digital thing, and it's all fake.
[01:49:42.232 --> 01:49:48.655]  And you sit there, but you realize they've been lied to so much by the media and culture, they don't know what's true now.
[01:49:49.075 --> 01:49:56.739]  That's a logical extension of learning Brian Williams is a liar, and massive election fraud's real, and a bunch of devil worshippers run stuff.
[01:49:57.359 --> 01:50:02.341]  Well then hell, if those people are telling you the world's round, it's probably flat, right?
[01:50:05.083 --> 01:50:05.483]  But it's not.
[01:50:06.348 --> 01:50:08.028]  It's not always been lies at this level.
[01:50:08.408 --> 01:50:10.529]  They used to think it was flat, then they said it was round.
[01:50:10.749 --> 01:50:11.709]  The Bible says it's round.
[01:50:13.650 --> 01:50:15.650]  But it's healthy that people have that level of doubt.
[01:50:15.710 --> 01:50:28.353]  You're supposed to be able to doubt things, but it's just I sit there and I tell the flat earthers, hey, I'm able to look at moons orbiting Jupiter on a clear night, and I can see them turning.
[01:50:34.471 --> 01:50:35.512]  And they say, no, you can't.
[01:50:36.913 --> 01:50:37.593]  And they get mad.
[01:50:38.694 --> 01:50:40.655]  And they got little sayings, like the Q Group.
[01:50:41.336 --> 01:50:44.438]  Oh, why are you so obsessed with the ball?
[01:50:44.658 --> 01:50:46.099]  Oh, you're in love with your ball.
[01:50:46.159 --> 01:50:55.025]  And it's just like... But see, that's just a way when things were so crazy with devil worship and world government and New World Order and all these serious things just kind of go, none of it matters.
[01:50:57.346 --> 01:51:02.550]  It's... It's a realm and then, you know, and then it's an ice wall and just all of this.
[01:51:04.667 --> 01:51:09.009]  But those folks, the media attacks.
[01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:21.193]  But they don't attack the head of Bank of America a few years ago said, we've got mathematical equations, we believe the world is a simulation, held by something, we're in an artificial reality, and we want to develop plans to break out of it.
[01:51:21.852 --> 01:51:24.733]  And then all these billionaires are saying that's what their religion is.
[01:51:24.974 --> 01:51:26.354]  We're trapped in a false reality.
[01:51:26.754 --> 01:51:28.795]  We must build supercomputers to break out of it.
[01:51:29.096 --> 01:51:29.836]  That's like Satan.
[01:51:30.096 --> 01:51:31.056]  It's all fake.
[01:51:31.337 --> 01:51:31.917]  God's bad.
[01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:32.637]  This is all fake.
[01:51:32.697 --> 01:51:35.439]  We've got to break away from it and make our own universe!
[01:51:35.539 --> 01:51:35.859]  See?
[01:51:36.739 --> 01:51:38.800]  We're now at that level where the devil was.
[01:51:40.321 --> 01:51:44.403]  Oh, that's completely normal to say everything's held in place and it's all a simulation.
[01:51:44.423 --> 01:51:46.504]  That's all over the news now, the last five years.
[01:51:47.264 --> 01:51:50.166]  All those atheists suddenly tell you that everything is a
[01:51:51.331 --> 01:51:51.831]  Simulation.
[01:51:51.891 --> 01:51:52.932]  Yeah, there's a Venus.
[01:51:53.672 --> 01:51:55.173]  It's beginning its transit soon.
[01:51:55.213 --> 01:51:55.733]  I forget when.
[01:51:55.773 --> 01:51:56.353]  It's very soon.
[01:51:56.413 --> 01:51:57.653]  Across the sun.
[01:51:58.194 --> 01:51:59.714]  I have sat there with my telescope.
[01:51:59.734 --> 01:52:00.775]  It's in storage someplace.
[01:52:01.615 --> 01:52:02.855]  Back when I had time to do such things.
[01:52:02.895 --> 01:52:03.356]  Wouldn't that happen?
[01:52:03.556 --> 01:52:04.836]  I've watched that myself.
[01:52:05.416 --> 01:52:07.357]  I've sat there with my telescope.
[01:52:07.397 --> 01:52:08.798]  It's glass with the magnifier.
[01:52:09.018 --> 01:52:12.339]  And I've sat there in my yard in the daytime looking at the sun.
[01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:14.580]  And I've watched Venus go across it.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.281]  But it's not real!
[01:52:16.881 --> 01:52:17.081]  See?
[01:52:20.765 --> 01:52:23.126]  And everything's fine, cuz Q's real, we're bringing in the whole Deep State.
[01:52:23.166 --> 01:52:25.487]  Well, I hope that's true, cuz the Deep State is in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:26.607 --> 01:52:30.509]  But not because of some magical group battling them, because Schiff and all these people are so ham-fisted.
[01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:39.732]  So I'm gonna go to Brad, and I'm gonna go to Wilde, and I'm gonna go to Carlos, and Gary, and Michael, and Kevin, and Sargent, and many others when we come back for two segments.
[01:52:40.252 --> 01:52:42.433]  And then Paul Joseph Watson takes over, he's ready to go.
[01:52:42.453 --> 01:52:42.933]  But Roger Stone,
[01:52:53.467 --> 01:52:56.048]  I believe he'll be convicted, and it's a frightening thought.
[01:52:56.829 --> 01:53:00.331]  First they silenced him and took him off social media, you notice, right before the indictment.
[01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:10.276]  And then his wife and people had some social media, and he'd comment on it, and they'd say, oh, you threatened the judge when he did, and so they'd say, we'll put you in jail if you talk now.
[01:53:10.636 --> 01:53:12.097]  That's why they want to shut me up.
[01:53:13.263 --> 01:53:20.630]  So they can take me off air, lie about me, and create this new cartoon character that's Alex Jones that they'll use as credit to the Liberty Movement.
[01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:22.932]  They want to steal my identity, my essence.
[01:53:23.172 --> 01:53:25.174]  They want to steal your essence, your children's essence.
[01:53:25.455 --> 01:53:27.557]  They want to control you.
[01:53:28.057 --> 01:53:28.578]  Don't let them.
[01:53:30.459 --> 01:53:35.504]  And you see everybody rioting for Popeye's fried chicken sandwiches that really aren't even that good.
[01:53:35.644 --> 01:53:36.125]  I've had one.
[01:53:37.606 --> 01:53:42.231]  And will they riot for iodine that's on record boosting your IQ and increasing fertility and health?
[01:53:42.691 --> 01:53:47.917]  Will they riot for fish oil that's so good for your brain, your cardiovascular system, your eyesight, your whole way of life?
[01:53:48.417 --> 01:53:49.518]  I'm just addicted to fish oil.
[01:53:49.799 --> 01:53:49.959]  No.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:58.968]  Notice the system gives you some gross GMO crappy tasting thing that people riot believing they're getting something really special because they heard it was great.
[01:53:59.028 --> 01:53:59.709]  That's all false.
[01:54:01.049 --> 01:54:07.753]  But we're promoting things that aren't like magic lottery tickets that won a 10 million win, but you still feel like you're part of something so you get into it.
[01:54:07.993 --> 01:54:17.620]  This is something where DNA Force Plus really does make your telomeres last longer, really does clean out your DNA, really does clean out your mitochondrial DNA, really does amazing things with the PQQ and the CoQ10.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:18.580]  It's 50% off right now.
[01:54:19.901 --> 01:54:21.141]  Double Patriot points, free shipping.
[01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:22.302]  That's the big special.
[01:54:22.362 --> 01:54:22.982]  DNA Force.
[01:54:23.002 --> 01:54:27.383]  You owe it to yourself to research it at InfoWarsTore.com and find out why it's such an amazing formula.
[01:54:27.643 --> 01:54:28.683]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:54:28.943 --> 01:54:29.964]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:54:30.244 --> 01:54:31.244]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:32.424]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:54:34.305 --> 01:54:37.646]  Alright, let's go right to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:38.106 --> 01:54:40.746]  Carlos, because we've got open phones for everybody, is a regular caller.
[01:54:40.806 --> 01:54:41.347]  Always smart.
[01:54:41.387 --> 01:54:42.287]  We're going to move quick.
[01:54:42.347 --> 01:54:46.868]  Carlos in Canada, what is your view on the show trial of Roger Stone?
[01:54:48.021 --> 01:54:51.263]  It's a pity that it wasn't like Jussie Smollett, right?
[01:54:51.283 --> 01:54:52.785]  Yeah.
[01:54:54.085 --> 01:54:55.667]  He got a nice break, didn't he?
[01:54:55.687 --> 01:54:58.729]  That's because he was trying to start a race war.
[01:54:58.749 --> 01:54:59.589]  He was doing his job.
[01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:01.571]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:01.631 --> 01:55:08.236]  Well, actually, Judge Amy Berman Jackson is a very experienced lawyer.
[01:55:08.836 --> 01:55:16.922]  She was, in fact, so experienced that she dismissed the case and the allegations and the charges against Hillary Clinton in the Benghazi case.
[01:55:17.671 --> 01:55:25.213]  And it seems to me that having been an appointee of President Obama, this might have been irrelevant.
[01:55:26.053 --> 01:55:30.255]  Again, the Manafort case subsequently, and now Roger Stone.
[01:55:30.695 --> 01:55:43.518]  Now, basically, a judge knows how to run a case, and from what I read in the literature, Roger Stone wasn't very wise in depicting with crosshairs and a picture and so on.
[01:55:43.538 --> 01:55:45.759]  I think he lost it for a while, you know?
[01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:56.033]  But I hope that this judge will take relevance in the fact that she has to be objective as a judge.
[01:55:56.454 --> 01:56:11.245]  And I hope that, in all fairness, it doesn't go any further than that, because there is an underlying story that people very little talk about, and that is that the financing of judges and district attorneys by George Soros' organization
[01:56:11.724 --> 01:56:14.226]  Well, brother, Carlos, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:14.246 --> 01:56:21.972]  You've been calling in for years, and I usually agree with you, but maybe you missed it because I've been really close to the case.
[01:56:21.992 --> 01:56:22.813]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:38.703 --> 01:56:43.566]  Roger Stone did not put out on the Instagram a picture of crosshairs over the judge.
[01:56:43.686 --> 01:56:49.569]  He posted an article from a site that had bullet points with a circle with lines.
[01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:53.172]  That's the site's symbol that they put out by bullet points.
[01:56:54.292 --> 01:56:56.133]  With bullet points on how she was corrupt.
[01:56:57.454 --> 01:56:59.215]  And so they just said that was crosshairs.
[01:56:59.235 --> 01:57:02.317]  Kind of like... Yeah, there it is on screen.
[01:57:03.077 --> 01:57:03.858]  Kind of like...
[01:57:05.256 --> 01:57:13.905]  We had the Grim Reaper in here talking about Jeffrey Epstein during a four-hour show, and then the national news said we had a Grim Reaper in here saying we'd kill the juries.
[01:57:13.925 --> 01:57:15.667]  Of course, the news didn't show that.
[01:57:16.988 --> 01:57:18.690]  Even Brian Williams had a report on it, I'm told.
[01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:19.270]  What a fraud.
[01:57:19.991 --> 01:57:22.834]  No, no, they just say, oh, we had a Grim Reaper on there, so it's...
[01:57:24.202 --> 01:57:27.564]  My Grim Reaper is even more removed than that, but that's what they do.
[01:57:28.324 --> 01:57:32.807]  If anybody's lost in the last few years, it's me sometimes, but I'm losing it in a good way, you know what I mean?
[01:57:33.147 --> 01:57:34.288]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:57:34.308 --> 01:57:37.250]  Let's talk to Gary in Florida, then Sergeant.
[01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:38.110]  Gary, you're on the air.
[01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:38.530]  Welcome.
[01:57:40.231 --> 01:57:41.512]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:57:41.952 --> 01:57:42.673]  Good, brother.
[01:57:43.173 --> 01:57:51.518]  I want to tell you, my first transmission for you, all your listeners, is that 12 years ago, I was given a year and a half to live.
[01:57:52.217 --> 01:57:53.998]  Uh, with the fourth stage cancer.
[01:57:54.798 --> 01:57:57.619]  And I told him, forget the dumb medicines that don't work.
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:02.061]  Started some herbs, went on a lot of your stuff, and I'm still here fighting.
[01:58:02.461 --> 01:58:04.622]  So, that's the first transmission.
[01:58:05.002 --> 01:58:05.363]  Beautiful.
[01:58:06.143 --> 01:58:11.745]  The second transmission I have for the followers, I called before and I said, Roger, it was one of the keys.
[01:58:12.406 --> 01:58:15.467]  And I said, you're also a key, and I'll tell you why.
[01:58:16.807 --> 01:58:20.309]  I said, they let Assange go, and that was Pompeo.
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.241]  And everything is tied to Russia.
[01:58:23.662 --> 01:58:33.569]  And the reason they're using Russia is to, we know with that whole thing with the Mueller, the Ukraine thing now we're noticing is being tied back to Russia.
[01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:39.053]  He was weak on Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting Russia, so forth and so on.
[01:58:39.754 --> 01:58:43.697]  The correlation with Roger to Assange, he's part of Russia.
[01:58:44.277 --> 01:58:45.999]  You, same thing.
[01:58:46.159 --> 01:58:48.841]  And we're going to use all these different things
[01:58:49.795 --> 01:58:52.517]  We thought was to get Hillary in, okay?
[01:58:52.937 --> 01:58:58.821]  Now the next thing after Ukraine, if they throw Schiff over the thing, will be, they're going to go after his taxes.
[01:58:59.141 --> 01:59:01.683]  And if they open the taxes, they'll tie it to Russia.
[01:59:01.703 --> 01:59:06.846]  They're going to keep going one thing after the next and keep tying it to Russia.
[01:59:07.467 --> 01:59:08.387]  That's the one thing.
[01:59:09.068 --> 01:59:12.450]  The next thing I'm going to say is one way or another, we're going to get Roger out.
[01:59:14.051 --> 01:59:16.973]  The last part of the transmission, because I know I'm in limited time.
[01:59:18.052 --> 01:59:20.854]  When I listen to you, you're like a bull in a china shop.
[01:59:20.894 --> 01:59:22.055]  You know so much.
[01:59:23.156 --> 01:59:24.096]  You have knowledge.
[01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:25.858]  You have content.
[01:59:26.338 --> 01:59:27.579]  You have contacts.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.681]  That's why you're a threat to them.
[01:59:30.201 --> 01:59:34.244]  But you also have great people, and you can't listen to everyone's show.
[01:59:35.185 --> 01:59:41.749]  You had a guy, Matt Bracken, and he did a show with this ex-CIA guy.
[01:59:41.769 --> 01:59:43.691]  I think his name was Johnson.
[01:59:44.418 --> 01:59:44.758]  I saw it.
[01:59:44.779 --> 01:59:46.020]  We need to get that fellow back on.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.621]  Yeah, he was a high-level CIA.
[01:59:47.902 --> 01:59:49.323]  That was a good interview.
[01:59:49.403 --> 01:59:57.571]  He explained that not only does Brennan still have his, uh, his, his, um, what do you call it?
[01:59:58.532 --> 01:59:59.373]  Security clearance.
[01:59:59.973 --> 02:00:00.234]  Right.
[02:00:01.772 --> 02:00:09.316]  Oh, Brennan still commands a whole Deep State group, and they literally, Trump ordered him to lose his security clearance, the Deep State wouldn't do it!
[02:00:09.777 --> 02:00:13.358]  Well then Trump literally fires and has indicted, who did that?
[02:00:13.699 --> 02:00:16.760]  It's a governmental mutiny against the President and the people.
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.041]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:00:18.861 --> 02:00:20.342]  So Haskell's still in charge.
[02:00:20.662 --> 02:00:24.024]  I remember Ray, see unlike the, I remember things.
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:30.767]  That guy Ray was in front, they asked him, what is the number one problem with Antifa, with what's going on?
[02:00:30.827 --> 02:00:32.249]  What is the number one problem?
[02:00:32.782 --> 02:00:34.542]  He said white nationalists.
[02:00:35.002 --> 02:00:37.563]  Okay, so they tell you what they're planning in the future.
[02:00:38.243 --> 02:00:40.023]  This guy Barr is supposed to... That's right.
[02:00:40.103 --> 02:00:54.866]  White people have been chosen as the group to persecute and then to identify the Bill of Rights, Constitution, and freedom with white people so that all the new immigrants want to reject Americana because they see it as white supremacist and then they themselves never get to enjoy that great birthright.
[02:00:54.946 --> 02:00:55.646]  Great points.
[02:00:55.766 --> 02:00:56.626]  God bless you, Gary.
[02:00:57.786 --> 02:00:59.727]  We're unified by the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:00:59.747 --> 02:01:01.287]  We're unified by love of America.
[02:01:02.759 --> 02:01:11.668]  They want to taint nationalism, the existence of the country itself, with these white elites that don't like the brown people, so that brown people then hate America.
[02:01:11.748 --> 02:01:12.869]  It's just totally cold-blooded.
[02:01:12.909 --> 02:01:14.771]  It's in the WikiLeaks, and you're absolutely right, sir.
[02:01:14.791 --> 02:01:15.292]  God bless you.
[02:01:16.393 --> 02:01:18.655]  Okay, Sergeant in California, you're on the air.
[02:01:20.096 --> 02:01:20.957]  Good afternoon, sir.
[02:01:20.977 --> 02:01:21.578]  How are you today?
[02:01:21.638 --> 02:01:21.958]  I'm good.
[02:01:21.978 --> 02:01:22.559]  Thanks for calling.
[02:01:23.647 --> 02:01:24.708]  Thank you for having me.
[02:01:25.008 --> 02:01:31.772]  I just wanted to let you know I'm a daily user of the Real Red Pill Plus Ultimate Fish Oil and of course, the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:01:31.812 --> 02:01:32.833]  I have two of those in my house.
[02:01:33.393 --> 02:01:34.554]  Your products are phenomenal.
[02:01:34.574 --> 02:01:37.776]  The iodine, I forgot the X2, can't forget the X2.
[02:01:38.036 --> 02:01:39.917]  Love, love, love the iodine.
[02:01:40.237 --> 02:01:45.500]  I actually, believe it or not, I put a drop or two into my kids bottle every week.
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:48.202]  Once a week, every week, you know, just give them a little iodine kick.
[02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:57.937]  And man, he's not even two years old yet, he knows colors, and you know, he's already saying... Oh, my daughter's a little more than two and a half years old, and everyone freaks out.
[02:01:57.997 --> 02:02:05.098]  She knows hundreds of songs, she speaks in complete sentences, she can literally, you know, jump on top of a table from the ground.
[02:02:05.358 --> 02:02:08.239]  People go, what is this, a Tasmanian devil or something?
[02:02:08.619 --> 02:02:14.940]  And that's because fish oil, clean fish oil, iodine, everything, and of course, no vaccines, yeah.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.501]  I mean, she basically has, like, lasers shooting out of her eyes.
[02:02:18.635 --> 02:02:18.955]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:18.975 --> 02:02:20.896]  That's exactly how I feel about my son.
[02:02:21.076 --> 02:02:27.620]  And before I ask my question here, I just want you to know you are a breath of fresh air in this toxic world.
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:30.102]  Not to sound too sycophantic or anything.
[02:02:31.623 --> 02:02:32.703]  No, brother, it's not that.
[02:02:32.743 --> 02:02:34.264]  It's just that all of us are in this fight.
[02:02:34.384 --> 02:02:35.085]  You're awesome.
[02:02:35.225 --> 02:02:37.026]  And I'm just saying you are the answer.
[02:02:37.266 --> 02:02:38.246]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:02:39.187 --> 02:02:42.549]  And I bring you to the third dimension all the time to people I know.
[02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:46.771]  I mean, I'm out at swap meets and I see these beautiful families together.
[02:02:46.831 --> 02:02:47.872]  The first thing I think of is,
[02:02:48.615 --> 02:02:53.076]  You know, when we're talking about California and how bad it is here, and I'm like, oh, have you heard of Alex Jones and Infowars?
[02:02:53.096 --> 02:02:53.657]  They're like, no.
[02:02:53.697 --> 02:02:54.797]  And I'm like, you need to get into that.
[02:02:54.837 --> 02:02:56.097]  You need to get into the arena.
[02:02:56.117 --> 02:02:56.918]  You need to help us out.
[02:02:57.638 --> 02:02:58.878]  So I'm spreading word about you.
[02:02:58.958 --> 02:03:00.779]  I'm hacking the third dimension every day for you.
[02:03:00.979 --> 02:03:04.020]  And my question, where's Gerald Nadler?
[02:03:06.421 --> 02:03:07.941]  You know, that's a great point.
[02:03:07.981 --> 02:03:14.463]  He's supposedly running all this in the house, and he's MIA after it looked like he had that stroke, remember, on TV a few months ago?
[02:03:14.724 --> 02:03:15.364]  He collapsed?
[02:03:15.384 --> 02:03:15.604]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:17.125 --> 02:03:21.216]  I'm asking that question in response to a great point you brought up yesterday that
[02:03:23.692 --> 02:03:29.034]  This impeachment inquiry hearing crap is all going on in an intelligence committee.
[02:03:29.074 --> 02:03:30.795]  That's unprecedented and unheard of.
[02:03:31.195 --> 02:03:32.616]  Where's the judiciary committee?
[02:03:32.756 --> 02:03:35.397]  It's a coup by the rogue intelligence agents.
[02:03:35.437 --> 02:03:36.618]  He's run by John Brennan.
[02:03:36.638 --> 02:03:37.838]  John Brennan was on C-SPAN.
[02:03:38.098 --> 02:03:39.459]  They go, thank God for the deep state.
[02:03:39.499 --> 02:03:40.539]  We're taking Trump out.
[02:03:40.559 --> 02:03:41.580]  They're all like, yay!
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:42.840]  And like, there's the enemy.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.522]  Anti-American globalists that sold us out, that hate the country.
[02:03:47.282 --> 02:03:54.206]  And then, and they're all a bunch of chicken-necked devil worshippers and pedophiles and, and then crypt keepers and they can't even walk.
[02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:56.247]  And we're all just bowing to their evil.
[02:03:56.507 --> 02:03:58.207]  Oh, Hillary, you stinking witch!
[02:03:58.708 --> 02:04:00.188]  People go, oh my God, she'll kill you.
[02:04:00.228 --> 02:04:02.290]  You went and bullhorned her and got in her face.
[02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.890]  Whatever!
[02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:06.852]  I get killed, I'm not looking for that, but whatever, it's a war!
[02:04:07.975 --> 02:04:09.555]  All I know is we're going to win this thing.
[02:04:09.575 --> 02:04:10.716]  We have to get past the fear.
[02:04:10.996 --> 02:04:12.556]  Stop caring what people think and tell the truth.
[02:04:12.616 --> 02:04:13.397]  And damn, you're damn right.
[02:04:13.417 --> 02:04:13.817]  I appreciate you.
[02:04:13.857 --> 02:04:14.257]  God bless you.
[02:04:15.097 --> 02:04:16.737]  Sergeant, just keep spreading the word for all of us.
[02:04:17.538 --> 02:04:18.998]  And say it's forbidden information.
[02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:20.498]  It's the most demonized show in the world.
[02:04:20.558 --> 02:04:21.799]  Why do you think they attack it?
[02:04:22.079 --> 02:04:27.080]  Why do they have all the shows like Homeland and The Good Doctor attacking Alex Jones and admitting it and all of this?
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:27.720]  Why?
[02:04:28.341 --> 02:04:30.881]  Because we've got their number and we're not afraid.
[02:04:31.241 --> 02:04:32.682]  And I'm nothing special, folks.
[02:04:33.602 --> 02:04:39.546]  I'm telling you, once you get triggered into the real reality of this, you're like, whoa.
[02:04:40.246 --> 02:04:44.029]  And all of a sudden, you turn these parts of your brain on that are fight evil and build the next level.
[02:04:44.349 --> 02:04:46.370]  It's like you've got the whole operating system.
[02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:47.291]  God goes, here, you want it?
[02:04:48.191 --> 02:04:50.573]  Turn it on, and you'll have discernment.
[02:04:50.593 --> 02:04:51.814]  You'll see with new eyes.
[02:04:52.174 --> 02:04:53.715]  We'll be back, hour number four.
[02:04:56.442 --> 02:04:58.543]  All right, let's move quick through more of your great calls.
[02:04:58.623 --> 02:04:59.684]  I've been trying to go to more calls.
[02:04:59.724 --> 02:05:01.825]  I've been doing a little bit better job, but you've got my commitment.
[02:05:02.285 --> 02:05:04.307]  Tomorrow, I'm going to take at least two hours of calls.
[02:05:05.087 --> 02:05:07.208]  More calls coming up during the War Room with Owen Schroer.
[02:05:07.248 --> 02:05:10.970]  More calls coming up during Firepower with the great crew there.
[02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:12.671]  I want to go to Kevin and a few others.
[02:05:12.712 --> 02:05:15.213]  I want to get jammed in here really quickly here.
[02:05:15.333 --> 02:05:17.754]  Brad NPA, you're on the air.
[02:05:17.774 --> 02:05:18.415]  Thanks for calling.
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:20.701]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:05:20.721 --> 02:05:21.681]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:05:21.822 --> 02:05:22.682]  Thanks for all you do.
[02:05:22.762 --> 02:05:23.883]  Thanks for all your great products.
[02:05:24.644 --> 02:05:25.845]  Love the toothpaste.
[02:05:26.245 --> 02:05:28.407]  Can't wait to try that new toothpaste that your dad developed.
[02:05:28.748 --> 02:05:28.968]  Thank you.
[02:05:29.368 --> 02:05:32.431]  And thanks for humanizing everything because you do a great job of that.
[02:05:32.551 --> 02:05:35.613]  I mean, you've been on the air so long and done so much work.
[02:05:36.794 --> 02:05:38.636]  Worked so hard for so long.
[02:05:38.696 --> 02:05:40.658]  It's just hard to believe, but great job.
[02:05:40.678 --> 02:05:41.098]  Keep it up.
[02:05:41.298 --> 02:05:41.559]  Thank you.
[02:05:42.276 --> 02:05:49.598]  I want to just say that I think the deep state, we need to throw that term out and just say CIA, because I think they're running everything.
[02:05:49.618 --> 02:05:50.138]  They are.
[02:05:50.278 --> 02:05:53.039]  They're trying to run Trump out of the office.
[02:05:53.819 --> 02:05:57.320]  They're running all the shenanigans with the elections, probably, I'm guessing.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:01.241]  And you know, it's... And it's just a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats.
[02:06:01.281 --> 02:06:02.542]  It's not James Bond.
[02:06:02.962 --> 02:06:10.404]  It's a bunch of hunchbacks like Brennan and Clapper and this wimpy little, you know, lib turd.
[02:06:12.725 --> 02:06:14.466]  Sierra Mela, what a joke!
[02:06:14.486 --> 02:06:15.786]  These people are pathetic!
[02:06:16.046 --> 02:06:17.287]  They're a bunch of Ed Bucks!
[02:06:17.987 --> 02:06:22.309]  They all dress up, little outfits, new rituals, and a bunch of sick freaks.
[02:06:23.229 --> 02:06:31.932]  Then they must all be compromised, obviously, because they just push their buttons and they get these people up on fake chargers.
[02:06:32.032 --> 02:06:34.313]  I can't believe Roger Stone would be convicted.
[02:06:34.333 --> 02:06:35.794]  They've already got nothing on him.
[02:06:35.814 --> 02:06:38.335]  They take Biden, who is caught on
[02:06:39.482 --> 02:06:41.663]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[02:06:42.744 --> 02:06:45.545]  What do you think about the Kentucky situation?
[02:06:45.625 --> 02:06:46.906]  I saw that's why you called.
[02:06:57.239 --> 02:06:58.660]  Yeah, well, that was another thing.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:04.322]  I mean, I was watching the returns come in that night, and I saw that the Kentucky governor was ahead.
[02:07:04.442 --> 02:07:05.703]  And I'm like, uh-huh.
[02:07:06.183 --> 02:07:07.204]  I know what's going to happen.
[02:07:07.544 --> 02:07:10.085]  I know they're going to say he lost, and it's going to be close.
[02:07:10.945 --> 02:07:12.946]  And that's exactly what they did.
[02:07:13.086 --> 02:07:15.187]  And of course, I knew there was going to be shenanigans.
[02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:17.368]  And you definitely need to get Bev Harris on it.
[02:07:17.408 --> 02:07:21.950]  And they do it close because if they steal it big, there's more fake votes to be found.
[02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.931]  That's why they only stole it by 5,000.
[02:07:24.281 --> 02:07:27.322]  And it's not unlike assassinations.
[02:07:27.462 --> 02:07:35.744]  And I'm just throwing that out there because you kill President Kennedy, you kill Bobby Kennedy, you kill Martin Luther King, you steal an election.
[02:07:36.344 --> 02:07:38.125]  Once it's done, what can you do?
[02:07:38.545 --> 02:07:41.006]  They're just going like, hey, there's nothing wrong here.
[02:07:41.406 --> 02:07:42.126]  Nothing to see.
[02:07:42.466 --> 02:07:43.146]  Move along.
[02:07:44.327 --> 02:07:45.867]  That's exactly what they do.
[02:07:45.927 --> 02:07:46.507]  God bless you.
[02:07:46.527 --> 02:07:47.408]  Amazing callers.
[02:07:47.468 --> 02:07:48.148]  And I went to them late.
[02:07:48.188 --> 02:07:48.428]  I feel bad.
[02:07:48.448 --> 02:07:49.588]  I'm not going to be able to get to all these.
[02:07:49.608 --> 02:07:51.849]  I'm trying to get to Wild, Eli.
[02:07:53.347 --> 02:07:59.493]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:08:00.013 --> 02:08:03.857]  Hey, so a couple things I wanted to talk about.
[02:08:04.237 --> 02:08:06.419]  Number one is the saturation of information.
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.545]  It seems like in the last three years, things have just accelerated to the point where
[02:08:13.525 --> 02:08:17.386]  You can't even keep up with everything, and they're using that as cover.
[02:08:17.446 --> 02:08:21.468]  When they come out with one thing, it's the parlor trick.
[02:08:21.828 --> 02:08:26.730]  While the magician is using his left hand to dazzle you, you're ignoring what his right hand's doing.
[02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:33.432]  And of course, what his right hand's doing is, you know, more of this crap with the impeachment.
[02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:35.893]  It's the pea and the three cups game.
[02:08:36.213 --> 02:08:39.894]  And that's why they hate InfoWars, because we laser beam in on what they're really doing.
[02:08:40.919 --> 02:08:42.843]  Well, it's what people are willing to accept.
[02:08:43.664 --> 02:08:46.249]  It's how far can you push the Overton window.
[02:08:47.145 --> 02:08:57.569]  Before you dial back and say, OK, well, this is where we were a little little off base here with Beto O'Rourke and saying, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[02:08:57.929 --> 02:09:06.713]  And now they're going to dial it back and say, well, we're just going to ask for magazine limitations or or ban certain semi autos and things like that.
[02:09:07.053 --> 02:09:11.395]  What I really think they're trying to cover up right now is the fact that if Donald Trump gets to 2020,
[02:09:12.944 --> 02:09:20.228]  And he wins the election, which we all know if he makes it that far and they don't impeach him, he will.
[02:09:20.268 --> 02:09:23.069]  That's the whole reason why they're running this whole thing.
[02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:23.869]  Oh, they're in trouble.
[02:09:23.929 --> 02:09:27.391]  Paul Watson's about to take over about the huge rebellion in Europe against the globalists.
[02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:28.171]  They're in trouble.
[02:09:28.572 --> 02:09:30.473]  But the fight's very, very real and very, very intense.
[02:09:30.493 --> 02:09:31.153]  I'm sorry to Kevin.
[02:09:31.173 --> 02:09:31.813]  I'm sorry to Wilde.
[02:09:31.853 --> 02:09:32.353]  Thank you, sir.
[02:09:33.194 --> 02:09:33.714]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:09:33.734 --> 02:09:34.775]  I'll get to the head of the line, guys.
[02:09:34.795 --> 02:09:34.935]  Love ya.
[02:09:35.935 --> 02:09:41.780]  Paul Watson takes over from England, and then the War Room with Owen Schroer is coming up.
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:44.342]  And then at 7 o'clock, Firepower with Will Johnson and Tom Pepper.
[02:10:02.824 --> 02:10:11.353]  And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor, and they didn't.
[02:10:12.074 --> 02:10:17.840]  So they said, they were walking out to the press conference, said, no, we're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[02:10:18.781 --> 02:10:20.983]  They said, you have no authority, you're not the president.
[02:10:21.023 --> 02:10:22.485]  The president said, I said, call him.
[02:10:23.985 --> 02:10:26.507]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[02:10:26.787 --> 02:10:28.007]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[02:10:28.047 --> 02:10:30.309]  I'm going to be leaving here, I think it was about six hours.
[02:10:30.389 --> 02:10:31.890]  I said, we're leaving in six hours.
[02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:35.392]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[02:10:35.452 --> 02:10:37.893]  Well, son of a bitch.
[02:10:37.913 --> 02:10:38.674]  Got fired.
[02:10:38.814 --> 02:10:41.796]  And they put in place someone who was a solid.
[02:10:53.806 --> 02:11:11.014]  November 14th edition of the show and I just got back from Poland, spent most of the week in Poland having travelled there from Budapest, Hungary.
[02:11:23.616 --> 02:11:27.940]  Last week, to attend the Polish Independence Day march of 2019.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:36.007]  This is the big patriotic march to celebrate Poland's independence from back in 1918.
[02:11:36.067 --> 02:11:39.730]  Of course, Poland ceased to exist as a country for about, I think it was about 123 years before that.
[02:11:41.852 --> 02:11:50.515]  So we got to march with the apparent extremists far right, as the media has denounced and decried them for years and years and years.
[02:11:50.875 --> 02:11:53.916]  Turns out they're not actually that extremist, that far right at all.
[02:11:54.496 --> 02:12:08.160]  It was mainly from what I saw, patriotic families fighting for the future of their country, fighting to avoid the same fate as Western countries in terms of the revolt against globalism.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:09.960]  So we're going to talk about that.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.341]  We're going to talk about
[02:12:12.444 --> 02:12:16.507]  Europe in general, we've got massive problems with grenade attacks in Sweden.
[02:12:17.167 --> 02:12:20.189]  We've got more terror attacks in France.
[02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:25.453]  We have a situation in the Netherlands where the Islamic call to prayer is now being blasted out.
[02:12:25.493 --> 02:12:27.054]  People are revolting against that.
[02:12:27.734 --> 02:12:32.658]  The Vox party in Spain, the populist party, is more successful than ever before.
[02:12:32.718 --> 02:12:38.802]  So we've really got a lot of positive news today regarding the revolt in Europe against globalism.
[02:12:39.764 --> 02:12:49.372]  But we spent about four days in Warsaw, Poland this week, not only marching on the Independence March, but meeting with members of Parliament.
[02:12:49.392 --> 02:12:50.413]  We actually got to visit.
[02:12:50.453 --> 02:12:54.556]  We're shown around the Polish Parliament yesterday because there's a new federation.
[02:12:55.357 --> 02:13:04.584]  There's a new coalition of populist right wing parties that in the recent Polish election, which took place, I think as recently as last week, won 11 seats in Parliament.
[02:13:04.684 --> 02:13:06.706]  And now they are going to be able to push back
[02:13:07.367 --> 02:13:29.745]  Against the more centrist Conservative Party in Poland, the ruling party, they call it the Nationalist Party, but it seems to be getting less nationalist and more globalist by the day, similar to the Conservative Party in Britain, which of course led to the creation beforehand of UKIP as a more populist pressure party, and then the Brexit Party with Nigel Farage.
[02:13:29.765 --> 02:13:32.968]  So we have a lot of similarities taking place in Poland,
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:43.024]  We got to meet Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who of course became a very controversial figure last year when he did a UK TV interview.
[02:13:43.444 --> 02:13:46.705]  He had his opinions, his thoughts completely misrepresented.
[02:13:47.125 --> 02:13:48.105]  We got to meet him.
[02:13:48.586 --> 02:13:57.129]  We got to meet Krzysztof Bozak, who is also a newly elected Member of Parliament in Poland as part of this, they called, right-wing coalition.
[02:13:57.955 --> 02:14:03.420]  And of course, we got to meet Gregorz Braun, who is also a Member of Parliament.
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:15.750]  So, big things happening in Poland, and they were very hospitable, very interested to work with the media world, the online world coming out of the United Kingdom and the United States.
[02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:18.432]  So, many exciting projects planned for that.
[02:14:19.533 --> 02:14:24.657]  But to just give you an idea of how this is being represented by the media, this is their National Independence Day.
[02:14:24.698 --> 02:14:26.219]  They have a march every year.
[02:14:27.461 --> 02:14:31.202]  To celebrate Poland, to celebrate patriotism, to celebrate families.
[02:14:31.602 --> 02:14:39.524]  A form of resistance against the globalism, the cultural impositions that are being foisted on the West in many other countries.
[02:14:39.984 --> 02:14:42.465]  And how does the media portray it?
[02:14:43.405 --> 02:14:44.806]  We have a headline out of Vice.
[02:14:45.566 --> 02:14:49.607]  Bigotry and fear filled Warsaw streets on Polish Independence Day.
[02:14:50.879 --> 02:15:00.741]  Really, I was right in the middle of it, marched with them for about five hours, didn't see much bigotry, certainly didn't feel any fear whatsoever.
[02:15:01.642 --> 02:15:10.504]  It says on Monday, a crowd of thousands celebrated the national holiday by taking aim at Jewish people, Islam, abortion and the LGBT community.
[02:15:12.544 --> 02:15:17.145]  Now to get this right, there are 150,000 people on the streets.
[02:15:17.585 --> 02:15:20.386]  The vast, vast majority of them were just
[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:24.803]  Patriotic, family-loving, country-loving Poles.
[02:15:25.244 --> 02:15:30.729]  Were there tiny pockets of actual right-wing extremists wearing Nazi memorabilia and things like that?
[02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.509]  Yes.
[02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:36.314]  But in comparison to the vast majority, it was miniscule.
[02:15:36.934 --> 02:15:38.195]  Absolutely miniscule.
[02:15:38.696 --> 02:15:40.738]  And many of these Poles carrying banners
[02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:51.539]  We're carrying banners that said they were against fascism, they were against communism, they were for Poland, for the territorial sovereignty, and against the European Union.
[02:15:51.599 --> 02:15:53.580]  That's why they're being attacked by the media.
[02:15:54.380 --> 02:16:02.725]  The article says, in recent years, Poland's Independence Day celebrations on the 11th of November have increasingly become a show of far-right extremism.
[02:16:03.226 --> 02:16:08.549]  Again, I did not see, with my own eyes, any far-right extremism whatsoever.
[02:16:09.358 --> 02:16:14.679]  This year's edition was no different, with the largest events again organised by extreme right-wing and nationalist groups.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:31.023]  Recently, Polish voters reinstated the Law and Justice Party, that is the mainstream nationalist party, they call it nationalist but it's really centrist, whose campaign was largely based on protecting Polish values by furiously attacking LGBT minorities.
[02:16:31.043 --> 02:16:36.925]  It goes on to say the gathering in the centre of Warsaw kicked off with a prayer, God forbid.
[02:16:37.697 --> 02:16:41.758]  Because, of course, this is an overwhelmingly Catholic country.
[02:16:41.818 --> 02:16:43.258]  The media absolutely hates that.
[02:16:43.598 --> 02:16:45.339]  Before organisers address the crowd.
[02:16:46.439 --> 02:16:57.001]  From the podium, Robert Bakowitz, head of the Independence March Association, and a former district head of the far-right National Radical Camp, said there is no Polishness without Catholicism.
[02:16:57.581 --> 02:16:58.742]  How dare he?
[02:16:59.202 --> 02:17:01.322]  Before making anti-Semitic claims.
[02:17:01.522 --> 02:17:04.843]  From what I heard from the translation, no, no anti-Semitic claims.
[02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:25.203]  There is an issue in Poland, which is a lot of countries in Europe have this issue, whereby Jewish people who have inheritance and no family to pass it on to, certain lobby groups within Poland are trying to get that money sent to Israel, but Polish people want the money to stay within the country.
[02:17:25.803 --> 02:17:29.766]  Is that anti-Semitic or is that merely protecting the interests of your own country?
[02:17:30.382 --> 02:17:33.483]  We met members of the Warsaw Resistance Uprising.
[02:17:33.943 --> 02:17:36.344]  A 90-year-old woman who was a member of that.
[02:17:36.384 --> 02:17:37.785]  Was she a neo-Nazi too?
[02:17:38.645 --> 02:17:44.247]  We met people carrying banners with the swastika crossed out saying they were against fascism.
[02:17:44.767 --> 02:17:47.528]  And here's Vice demonising them as neo-Nazis.
[02:17:48.769 --> 02:17:56.772]  The article continues, the crowd's hateful chants took aim at a range of perceived enemies from communists, leftists and Muslims to the LGBT community.
[02:17:57.352 --> 02:17:59.493]  Well no, what they were chanting about mainly
[02:18:00.732 --> 02:18:12.197]  Is the fact that Poland, the main party in Poland, the ruling party, has introduced a law which basically says you can't propagandize sexually or you can't encourage children to have sex.
[02:18:12.257 --> 02:18:14.238]  It's an anti-pedophilia law.
[02:18:14.799 --> 02:18:17.120]  The European Union is now railing against that.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.862]  Apparently to oppose that is to attack the LGBT community.
[02:18:22.759 --> 02:18:34.121]  I think honest people within the LGBT community will really want their movement, their rights, or what they represent linked with pedophilia, which is what this Polish law actually tackles.
[02:18:34.181 --> 02:18:35.962]  And I'm going to get into that on the other side.
[02:18:37.262 --> 02:18:38.402]  But the article continues.
[02:18:39.062 --> 02:18:44.163]  At one point, a group of counter protesters from the anti-fascist group Citizens of Poland attempted to block the march.
[02:18:44.323 --> 02:18:45.144]  Didn't see them.
[02:18:45.424 --> 02:18:49.565]  Basically saw no counter-protest whatsoever in the area that I was in.
[02:18:49.605 --> 02:18:50.205]  Again, 150,000 people marched.
[02:18:53.047 --> 02:19:03.292]  Later, a guest of the organizers, a discredited American psychologist Paul Cameron, told the crowd, brave Poles saved Europe from Islam, now they will save it from the deadly LGBT invasion.
[02:19:04.112 --> 02:19:18.639]  Yes, there was a lot of chants against LGBT because they see what's happening in America, in Sweden, in many of the European countries, with drag queen story time and this effort to impose in the culture war, not just
[02:19:19.219 --> 02:19:29.845]  But respect for LGBT people, not tolerance of LGBT people, but actual sexualisation of children and that's part of what they were marching against.
[02:19:29.865 --> 02:19:31.746]  We're going to get back into it more on the other side.
[02:19:32.067 --> 02:19:33.888]  Breaking news at summit.news.
[02:19:34.708 --> 02:19:43.634]  So Vice Magazine and much of the mainstream media demonised the Polish Independence Day march by calling it, in their words, a display of bigotry and fear.
[02:19:44.134 --> 02:19:52.640]  I was there amongst the 150,000 marchers in Warsaw, did not see much evidence whatsoever of bigotry and fear.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:53.881]  I just saw a
[02:19:54.671 --> 02:20:17.400]  Huge mass of people, families, young and old, celebrating their country and embracing its true ideals, celebrating Catholicism, their faith, huge banners of Jesus Christ everywhere, people dressed up in military gear, again to celebrate Poland's independence and reformation as a country, which didn't exist for over 100 years before that.
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:20.241]  But of course, what does Vice show in their photos?
[02:20:20.281 --> 02:20:20.681]  They show
[02:20:21.554 --> 02:20:25.438]  Oh, scary weapons being carried by men in military uniforms.
[02:20:25.458 --> 02:20:28.300]  Yes, it's a celebration of Poland's military history.
[02:20:28.361 --> 02:20:29.421]  What do you expect?
[02:20:30.442 --> 02:20:32.584]  You know, there were Hussars on horseback.
[02:20:32.664 --> 02:20:33.345]  It was really good.
[02:20:33.365 --> 02:20:34.706]  The energy was great.
[02:20:35.307 --> 02:20:36.688]  People flying flares.
[02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:43.534]  People really united, bonded together in love of patriotism and opposition to globalism.
[02:20:43.855 --> 02:20:46.077]  They carried anti-EU flags.
[02:20:47.037 --> 02:20:52.700]  They carried a flag of Poland throughout the whole march, which looked like it basically went on for a mile.
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:21:00.323]  You were watching it at the end of the march as the people carrying the flag marched through the field, which was the site of the end of the march.
[02:21:00.723 --> 02:21:07.186]  And it literally went on for about half an hour, this flag going through the field with no signs of it ending.
[02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:10.852]  So an absolutely fantastic few days in Poland.
[02:21:11.392 --> 02:21:17.013]  Met a lot of great people there who are fans of Alex Jones, fans of Infowars, fans of what we do.
[02:21:17.773 --> 02:21:19.294]  We had a great meet-up afterwards.
[02:21:20.194 --> 02:21:34.338]  And then of course we were lucky enough to get a tour of the Polish Parliament from members of the new coalition, the new federation they call it, of populist quote right-wing groups that are now being elected to Parliament.
[02:21:34.378 --> 02:21:35.938]  They've got 12 seats in Parliament.
[02:21:36.917 --> 02:21:52.125]  And one of the issues they're going to be pushing, having seen what's happened in the West, in America, in many European countries with this drag queen story time, with the increasing effort to make sexual education in schools applicable to younger and younger children.
[02:21:52.865 --> 02:22:00.969]  In the UK now, in some schools, children as young as five are being pushed, having forms of sexual education pushed on them.
[02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:30.559]  Polish people, Poland in general, despite the fact that in comparison to countries like Sweden, which they see recently granted the equivalent of $175,000 to directly from the government fund drag queen shows for children, they're using the inheritance money from people who don't have family, don't have anyone to pass it on to, basically stealing that money for the purposes of propagandizing LGBT propaganda, sexualization of children.
[02:22:31.474 --> 02:22:32.755]  That's happening in Sweden.
[02:22:32.795 --> 02:22:39.358]  Polish people are absolutely dead set on not allowing that kind of propaganda to infiltrate their own country.
[02:22:40.659 --> 02:22:47.462]  Which is why we have this policy being pushed in Poland by the new coalition parliamentarians and there's a headline out of Reuters.
[02:22:48.062 --> 02:22:52.585]  Polish lawmakers vote for bill criminalizing promoting underage sex.
[02:22:53.305 --> 02:22:58.507]  Again, how dare they promote a piece of legislation that discourages pedophilia?
[02:22:58.568 --> 02:22:59.408]  How dare they?
[02:23:00.347 --> 02:23:18.661]  Polish lawmakers on Wednesday voted in favour of a bill to criminalise the promotion, this is a direct quote from the bill, the promotion of underage sexual activity in a move seen by some as a government effort to court conservative support which outraged liberals who say the bill aims to ban sex education.
[02:23:19.602 --> 02:23:26.748]  It doesn't seek to do that, in fact there's a quote from the bill directly in this second article, which is out of Euronews,
[02:23:27.998 --> 02:23:32.641]  It says MEPs vote to condemn Poland's anti-sex education bill.
[02:23:33.621 --> 02:23:42.026]  So members of the European Parliament, globalist members of the European Parliament, have voted to condemn a bill in Poland which they believe will criminalise sex education in schools.
[02:23:42.606 --> 02:23:44.587]  This is what the actual text of the bill says.
[02:23:45.868 --> 02:23:55.073]  Anyone who promotes or approves sexual intercourse or other sexual activity by a minor, keyword there being minor, a child,
[02:23:56.030 --> 02:24:08.014]  In connection with performing the position, occupation or performing activities related to upbringing, education, healthcare or care of minors or operating on school premises is liable to imprisonment up to three years.
[02:24:09.135 --> 02:24:20.179]  So they literally just wrote a bill that says you can't encourage children to have sex illegally with pedophiles and now members of the European Parliament have voted to condemn it.
[02:24:21.613 --> 02:24:26.176]  The Polish government insists this legislation is to protect vulnerable children from pedophilia.
[02:24:26.596 --> 02:24:32.160]  This paragraph under the head of Stop Pedophilia, this law doesn't speak about any education issues.
[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:38.564]  It only prohibits promoting pedophilia, Polish MEP Beata Kemper insists.
[02:24:38.624 --> 02:24:43.287]  However, MEPs, globalist MEPs of the European Union disagreed.
[02:24:43.307 --> 02:24:46.169]  In fact, they voted 471 in favour and only 128 against.
[02:24:51.337 --> 02:24:56.860]  Condemning a bill which solely discourages promoting pedophilia in schools.
[02:24:57.220 --> 02:25:17.612]  Is it any wonder why more and more Polish people are out on the streets talking about not wanting this LGBT agenda pushed on their school children, when in many cases it's characterised as actually promoting pedophilia, as we've seen with the Drag Queen story time, several members of which
[02:25:18.317 --> 02:25:35.556]  These drag queens were not getting background checks, were being allowed around children, and in a couple of cases in Houston, as we covered, were actual child sex offenders, actual pedophiles, being allowed into libraries and schools to talk to children about their lifestyles.
[02:25:36.593 --> 02:25:51.120]  Polish people are out on the streets saying, no, we don't want to be like that, we don't want to be like Sweden, we don't want to be like the UK, where kids as young as five are being taught about sex education, now they're being demonised as racists, bigots and right-wing extremists.
[02:25:51.981 --> 02:25:53.901]  And MEPs are voting to condemn it.
[02:25:54.122 --> 02:25:55.582]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:25:56.103 --> 02:25:58.964]  But just the sheer energy, the sheer authenticity,
[02:26:00.063 --> 02:26:04.324]  Of what I saw in Warsaw was very, very uplifting and that's the thing.
[02:26:04.684 --> 02:26:06.264]  You just don't see that in the UK.
[02:26:06.284 --> 02:26:22.028]  In the UK there have been cases where people who simply try to fly the British flag on their own property get threatening letters from local government telling them to take it down because it could offend minorities and other people who live in the area.
[02:26:22.628 --> 02:26:29.410]  And then if they don't take the flag down, the flag of their own country which is being flown on their own property, in some cases
[02:26:30.439 --> 02:26:32.920]  Other residents nearby, tear it down!
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.000]  So yes, Poland sees what's happening in Europe.
[02:26:36.581 --> 02:26:40.862]  They see themselves as the vanguard of a new revolt against globalism.
[02:26:41.622 --> 02:26:52.465]  And many young people at this march, by being involved in this, by being so patriotic, wanting to protect their country, you know, living lives of authenticity and meaning.
[02:26:52.505 --> 02:26:53.125]  This is the thing.
[02:26:53.485 --> 02:26:55.365]  This is the same thing I saw in Hong Kong.
[02:26:55.925 --> 02:26:57.926]  In the West, we're beset by nihilism,
[02:26:58.877 --> 02:27:09.742]  Atomised societies where people don't even talk to each other anymore, don't even talk to their neighbours, are told that they should be ashamed of their country, ashamed of their history, ashamed of their skin colour.
[02:27:10.362 --> 02:27:15.865]  But in places like Poland, that backlash is really starting to brew.
[02:27:16.625 --> 02:27:19.086]  And we've seen it in Hungary and other places as well.
[02:27:19.146 --> 02:27:20.707]  So we're going to go back to Poland.
[02:27:20.767 --> 02:27:21.327]  It looks like
[02:27:22.344 --> 02:27:50.144]  You know, in four or five months time and really talk to more of these MPs and try to help them get the message out, try to rally around this populist patriotic message that seeks to restore faith, family and reason in a clown world, which has now come to the point where literally, as I said before, in Sweden, they're taking the money, the inheritance money from their own citizens and directly funding through government programs
[02:27:50.874 --> 02:28:04.060]  Drag queen story time, where these drag queens, many of them not background checked to be around children, are literally being allowed to propagandize their increasingly bizarre lifestyles to our children.
[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:06.841]  Poland is rejecting that in droves.
[02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:08.122]  Don't go away, we'll be back.
[02:28:08.962 --> 02:28:23.049]  We are back on the show and before we get into more news out of Europe, including what's happening in Sweden, I want to tell you about the great Black Friday specials which have already arrived over at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:30:10.006 --> 02:30:29.052]  Now back in March 2017, I put out a tweet which coincided with Trump making comments about the state of criminality in Sweden, which was of course greatly exacerbated by the migrant crisis, the fact they took in more migrants over that two-year period than any other European country.
[02:30:30.372 --> 02:30:38.995]  I put out a tweet challenging journalists to go and visit, to go and film the no-go zone ghetto areas of Sweden, specifically Malmo.
[02:30:39.716 --> 02:30:49.083]  Where before that tweet was put out, you had a camera crew from Australia go there and get physically attacked, you had soaring rapes, you had soaring violent crime.
[02:30:49.623 --> 02:30:52.745]  Trump pointed it out, his famous last night in Sweden comment.
[02:30:53.726 --> 02:31:03.133]  I challenged journalists to go out there and then there was like an international media smear campaign against yours truly, simply for telling journalists to go and do journalism.
[02:31:04.013 --> 02:31:13.895]  Of course, Tim Pool, a couple of weeks later, went out and was kicked out or at least forced to leave one of these no-go migrant ghettos, proving what I had said.
[02:31:13.915 --> 02:31:20.556]  And for the next two years, Sweden's violent crime rate has been soaring, their rape statistics have been getting worse.
[02:31:21.216 --> 02:31:28.958]  And finally, two years later, two and a half years later, the mainstream media is finally asking,
[02:31:29.542 --> 02:31:35.265]  With the BBC headline, Sweden's 100 Explosions This Year, what's going on?
[02:31:36.085 --> 02:31:45.290]  It took them two and a half years to ask this question, after having demonized anyone who asked the same question for the past two and a half years.
[02:31:47.151 --> 02:31:53.174]  Article reads, when three explosions took place in one night across different parts of Stockholm last month, it came as a shock to residents.
[02:31:53.234 --> 02:31:56.936]  There had been blasts in other city suburbs, but never on their doorstep.
[02:31:57.995 --> 02:32:03.018]  Swedish police are dealing with unprecedented levels of attacks targeting city centre locations too.
[02:32:03.598 --> 02:32:09.522]  The bomb squad was called to deal with 97 explosions in the first nine months of this year.
[02:32:10.422 --> 02:32:18.907]  Now what they like to do, apart from attack Christian churches, which is happening more and more in Sweden, is attack apartment buildings.
[02:32:19.287 --> 02:32:26.251]  This is mostly gang-on-gang violence, but it's gangs concentrated in these no-go ghetto areas
[02:32:27.344 --> 02:32:30.446]  It's second and third generation migrants.
[02:32:31.627 --> 02:32:44.915]  So as the category of crime explosions was not even logged prior to 2017, then in 2018 there were 162 explosions and in the past two months alone the bomb squad have been called to almost 30.
[02:32:46.336 --> 02:32:50.079]  Grenade attacks off the charts, we've got shootings off the charts.
[02:32:50.599 --> 02:32:55.042]  What otherwise should be a very peaceful, crime-free Sweden?
[02:32:56.064 --> 02:33:05.850]  And only at the very end of the article did they actually introduce the idea that this could be related to them bringing in hundreds of thousands of migrants, which exacerbate the problem.
[02:33:06.371 --> 02:33:19.179]  But again, they claim that it's just socioeconomics, that it's not the newly arrived migrants, not making the obvious connection that of course those newly arrived migrants later go on to become second and third generation migrants.
[02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:22.601]  The Spectator was more honest in its article about this.
[02:33:23.962 --> 02:33:24.823]  They put out an article
[02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:27.953]  Bomb attacks are now a normal part of Swedish life.
[02:33:28.713 --> 02:33:34.139]  Again, this is the cultural enrichment, the diversity that Poles are out on the streets marching against.
[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:37.082]  Spectator article makes the point.
[02:33:37.582 --> 02:33:40.886]  Normalization is a term that we've come to associate with domestic violence.
[02:33:40.926 --> 02:33:45.370]  The victim begins to think of abuse as part of everyday life.
[02:33:46.091 --> 02:33:49.154]  That classic frog boiling in the pot idea.
[02:33:50.459 --> 02:34:02.403]  Explosions have become so normalized in Sweden that SVT, Sweden's equivalent of the BBC, did not even mention the three explosions in the country's capital on its national news program that evening.
[02:34:03.063 --> 02:34:17.888]  And in fact we've covered other stories where left-wing Swedish newspapers will literally send out reporters to harass people who've posted comments online about maybe diversity not being such a strength to go out literally bang on their doors
[02:34:18.979 --> 02:34:20.940]  And, you know, accuse them of being hateful bigots.
[02:34:22.841 --> 02:34:32.825]  So the news, the main news network in Sweden, when they had three explosions in their capital city, did not even mention it on that night's news program.
[02:34:33.786 --> 02:34:35.107]  Consider the statistics.
[02:34:35.147 --> 02:34:39.369]  Between January and June this year, more than 100 explosions were reported in the country.
[02:34:39.729 --> 02:34:46.652]  Up from 70 last year, a total of more than 160 suspected attacks with explosives were reported last year.
[02:34:47.688 --> 02:34:53.813]  And that went from basically no grenade attacks, no explosive attacks, to 160 a year.
[02:34:54.213 --> 02:34:56.335]  The mainstream news is not talking about it.
[02:34:56.895 --> 02:34:57.696]  And listen to this.
[02:34:57.776 --> 02:35:02.880]  This is what Wilhelm Aggrell, Professor of Intelligence Analysis at Lund University said.
[02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:09.385]  He said that the situation has become so dire that the integrity of the Swedish state is in jeopardy.
[02:35:11.149 --> 02:35:23.399]  Does that signify to you that diversity is a strength, when the problem is so dire according to this Swedish professor, by no means a right-wing extremist, saying it literally threatens the power monopoly of the state?
[02:35:23.419 --> 02:35:26.441]  They're talking about a mini-civil war in some areas.
[02:35:26.922 --> 02:35:31.045]  The postmen in Sweden can't even go out and deliver packages and parcels.
[02:35:32.009 --> 02:35:48.636]  In these no-go area ghettos, because they get attacked, the fire service gets attacked, they get stones, they get bricks thrown at them if they try to put out fires, because of course car fires are another offshoot aspect of this great cultural enrichment program.
[02:35:50.054 --> 02:35:52.517]  So Agrell said, quote, So you actually have a state of low-level urban terrorism
[02:36:08.895 --> 02:36:29.821]  Pre-Civil War type scenarios, and again, the statistics show, and we had one of the big police chiefs in Sweden a couple of years ago come out and say, his name was Peter Springer, he went down the list of suspects in these violent attacks, these explosive attacks, these grenade attacks, and he said virtually every name was an Islamic name.
[02:36:29.981 --> 02:36:31.461]  That is the source of the problem.
[02:36:32.762 --> 02:36:33.782]  Meanwhile in Sweden,
[02:36:34.753 --> 02:36:37.737]  Swedish teen has ear cut off in brutal gang robbery.
[02:36:38.057 --> 02:36:43.944]  An 18-year-old young man had his ear partially or totally cut off by a youth gang who said to have robbed him of everything except his underwear.
[02:36:44.605 --> 02:36:54.317]  And in fact, there was a local government that put out a commercial, a video, advertising for people to come and live in its area, to come visit its area.
[02:36:55.245 --> 02:37:10.271]  Comparing their relative tranquility to what's happening in some of these no-go areas such as Malmo and areas of Stockholm, of course, for merely putting out an ad that said, let's make Sweden look like Sweden again, they were dragged.
[02:37:10.491 --> 02:37:11.952]  They were demonized as racist.
[02:37:12.612 --> 02:37:36.781]  Of course, the government's response to all this, despite the Sweden Democrats, the populist party, getting into Parliament, 18% of the national vote, but the Swedish government's response to the soaring violent crime, to the soaring rape stats, is to take the money from inheritance, which they've got nobody to pass on to because they've got no relatives who are alive, and give it to fund drag queen story time.
[02:37:36.801 --> 02:37:38.381]  That's the Swedish government's response.
[02:37:38.581 --> 02:37:40.042]  Absolutely despicable.
[02:37:40.082 --> 02:37:40.542]  We'll be back.
[02:37:41.227 --> 02:37:57.192]  So we had 100,000, 150,000 Poles marching on the streets, again in revolt, in resistance to the globalist agenda, to the cultural imposition that both Islam and the LGBT agenda has had on other European countries.
[02:37:58.072 --> 02:38:07.335]  Several more examples of that here, again exemplifying why those polls were so energetic, so engaged in marching against this kind of thing.
[02:38:07.355 --> 02:38:21.620]  Because in Sweden we've also had massive problems with the Islamic call to prayer being broadcast on loudspeakers in local areas and local residents protesting against that, but the government shoving it through.
[02:38:23.194 --> 02:38:24.315]  Headline out, Voice of Europe.
[02:38:24.355 --> 02:38:28.098]  Netherlands mosques amplified call to prayer silenced by a cut cable.
[02:38:28.939 --> 02:38:41.749]  Intensely amplified call to prayer at Amsterdam's Blue Mosque, which was set to be heard for the first time last Friday in the New West District of Amsterdam, was silenced by someone who cut the sound system's cable.
[02:38:42.714 --> 02:38:44.195]  Tomorrow they're just going to do it again.
[02:38:44.696 --> 02:38:51.581]  The Blue Mosque was set to be the first mosque in the Dutch capital, where the call to prayer broadcast will be amplified over loudspeakers.
[02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:54.904]  Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf reports.
[02:38:54.964 --> 02:39:01.189]  Of course, the reason they're doing it is because they want to turn Amsterdam into Islamabad, basically.
[02:39:01.289 --> 02:39:03.711]  That's what it's all about, occupying the territory.
[02:39:04.051 --> 02:39:12.218]  If you can broadcast that out, you know, to where it reaches people half a mile down the road, that then becomes your territory, basically.
[02:39:13.041 --> 02:39:24.251]  The controversial plan has faced plenty of resistance from Amsterdam locals who believe the amplification of the call to prayer to ungodly levels is aggressive, unnecessary, obnoxious and runs counter to Dutch values.
[02:39:25.032 --> 02:39:32.639]  Despite this, they went ahead with it anyway because it had been approved by the government and somebody cut the cord but they're just going to do it again.
[02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:38.805]  Gert Wilders, the leader of the National Populist Freedom Party, voiced his feelings about the Moss plan to amplify its call to prayer in a tweet.
[02:39:39.645 --> 02:39:42.288]  Writing, screaming, hate palaces must all close.
[02:39:42.308 --> 02:39:44.309]  Do it in Saudi Arabia, but not here.
[02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:47.693]  This is our country and Islam does not belong in the Netherlands.
[02:39:48.173 --> 02:40:02.687]  But again, it's the local politicians who, by the way, when you look at the stats, none of them live, even the leftists, the Greens, none of them choose to live in the areas with the highest concentration of mosques.
[02:40:03.351 --> 02:40:05.995]  Or anywhere near the so-called no-go zones.
[02:40:06.075 --> 02:40:07.096]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:40:07.136 --> 02:40:09.559]  Don't really tend to practice what they preach, do they?
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:17.530]  Meanwhile, in other cultural enrichment news, in Germany, Syrian and Afghan asylum seekers attack village disco with machetes!
[02:40:18.354 --> 02:40:25.159]  Syrian and Afghan asylum seekers attacked a village disco in a small German village armed with machetes after two were kicked out by a bouncer.
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:28.662]  This is another one of their favourite things that they seem to like to do.
[02:40:28.682 --> 02:40:33.886]  There was a case in Frankfurt when a group of asylum seekers did basically the same thing.
[02:40:35.267 --> 02:40:43.233]  You know, a couple of them, what happens, you know, a couple of them will get in the club or in the disco, they'll start harassing women, they'll get kicked out by the bouncers.
[02:40:43.993 --> 02:40:51.916]  And then half an hour later, a gang of 20 or 30 of their friends just turn up and start attacking the building with clubs and machetes.
[02:40:51.936 --> 02:40:56.978]  We've seen this in numerous European cities over the past three years.
[02:40:57.358 --> 02:41:01.179]  This incident occurred on Saturday in the village of Trebin in Brandenburg.
[02:41:01.739 --> 02:41:05.921]  A group of around 10 migrants attempted to hack down the door to the building with their machetes.
[02:41:06.821 --> 02:41:11.743]  The bouncer said the asylum seekers attempted to slash him in the neck, but he was able to fend them off and get inside.
[02:41:13.052 --> 02:41:17.353]  And then of course they brought their friends and the situation got worse, as they're prone to do.
[02:41:18.053 --> 02:41:22.235]  Meanwhile, France is target of more Islamic terror attacks than any other EU state.
[02:41:23.215 --> 02:41:27.736]  A new study shows that over half of the terror attacks in the EU occurred in France.
[02:41:29.097 --> 02:41:33.738]  They also have massive problems with actual jihadists working in airport security.
[02:41:33.858 --> 02:41:35.158]  What could possibly go wrong?
[02:41:36.299 --> 02:41:36.979]  Also in France,
[02:41:37.699 --> 02:41:45.080]  It's coming up to the one-year anniversary of the Yellow Vest demonstrations, which of course is part of this theme of the revolt against globalism.
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:54.042]  Naturally that's going to die down, and it has over the past few months, but it seems like it's going to be back in bigger numbers than we've seen in recent times.
[02:41:54.082 --> 02:41:59.463]  Headline out of Voice of Europe, Yellow Vest planned demonstrations for the protest movement's first birthday.
[02:42:00.043 --> 02:42:04.564]  Of course the origins of that demonstration, that massive protest, that massive uprising,
[02:42:05.370 --> 02:42:14.713]  Was the globalist in position on the rural communities in France when they hiked the gas taxes and other taxes related to livestock and farming?
[02:42:15.133 --> 02:42:18.254]  That brought the farmers out onto the streets of Paris.
[02:42:18.314 --> 02:42:32.138]  Then we saw a similar thing in Holland with the farmer protests there because of course they're trying to slash their ability to produce livestock in half again to satisfy Green New Deal style climate taxes.
[02:42:32.711 --> 02:42:38.455]  The massive revolt against globalism, against carbon taxes, is accelerating in virtually every European country.
[02:42:39.316 --> 02:42:44.900]  And now the Yellow Vest organisers have called on the French public to gather next Saturday on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.
[02:42:46.021 --> 02:42:52.385]  The Champs-Élysées, of course, the site where they banned protests entirely back in March to try and put a cap on this.
[02:42:53.106 --> 02:42:59.911]  But on Tuesday, the co-founder of the Yellow Vest Citizens sent a request to hold the new demonstration, the one-year anniversary demonstration,
[02:43:00.663 --> 02:43:05.389]  On the Champs-Élysées and the authorities are likely to say no.
[02:43:05.709 --> 02:43:11.776]  So again, there's going to be another clash between the yellow vests and the police likely to happen this weekend.
[02:43:11.816 --> 02:43:13.218]  We'll continue to monitor that.
[02:43:13.538 --> 02:43:19.425]  But it seems like the yellow vests are back as the revolt against globalism across Europe accelerates.
[02:43:20.819 --> 02:43:25.460]  Meanwhile, we've had a lot of fake hate crimes, fake racist attacks in the United States.
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:31.042]  They're also not uncommon across Europe, and we had another one today in Helsinki, Finland.
[02:43:31.902 --> 02:43:35.903]  Somali Social Democrat politician faked racist taxi story.
[02:43:36.484 --> 02:43:48.307]  This was a Social Democrat Party politician, Adirahim Hussain, who admitted to making up a hate hoax about a racist passenger in his taxi because he was, quote, angry.
[02:43:49.454 --> 02:44:02.284]  The Somalian immigrant and left-wing politician retracted his fictitious account of experiencing racist verbal abuse from a passenger in his taxi after the taxi company found that GPS data from the cab tracker refuted his claims.
[02:44:02.344 --> 02:44:03.826]  He apologized for lying.
[02:44:04.426 --> 02:44:06.728]  Of course, he'll face no consequences whatsoever.
[02:44:07.308 --> 02:44:16.656]  And it's likely that the raft of left-wing politicians and commentators who supported his initial claims will also face no consequences whatsoever.
[02:44:17.777 --> 02:44:18.878]  Meanwhile in Hong Kong,
[02:44:19.454 --> 02:44:22.156]  Well, they're having their own backlash against authoritarianism.
[02:44:22.856 --> 02:44:28.881]  Headline out of Breitbart, 15-year-old boy hospitalized, 70-year-old man killed in Hong Kong street battles.
[02:44:28.901 --> 02:44:40.189]  The 15-year-old boy in Hong Kong is in critical condition after undergoing emergency brain surgery on Wednesday night after a blow to his head, most likely the impact of a tear gas canister fired by the police.
[02:44:41.038 --> 02:44:54.281]  And a 70-year-old man died after spending the night in intensive care for a head injury from a brick thrown during a street battle, while a man dressed in black clothing favoured by protesters fell to his death under unclear circumstances.
[02:44:54.341 --> 02:45:05.423]  Now remember, one of the primary reasons the Hong Kong demonstrators are out on the streets is because of their opposition to mass migration from China.
[02:45:06.368 --> 02:45:14.751]  Chinese people can move to Hong Kong, they can immediately get welfare, health benefits, they can become citizens of Hong Kong basically immediately.
[02:45:15.272 --> 02:45:23.735]  They introduce their own culture, it clashes with the more westernized Hong Kong culture, and that's why many of those protesters are still out on the streets.
[02:45:24.455 --> 02:45:33.759]  And today we have yet another warning that the crackdown, the military Beijing Tiananmen Square style crackdown could be imminent.
[02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:44.706]  Because the President of China has remarked, Zero Hedge reports, President Xi warns stopping the storm and restoring order in Hong Kong is China's top priority.
[02:45:45.647 --> 02:45:47.508]  He said it was their most urgent task.
[02:45:48.275 --> 02:45:54.496]  Basically, a lot of people are asking the question, which has been asked before, is a crackdown imminent?
[02:45:54.976 --> 02:45:57.497]  Hong Kong's already gone into recession.
[02:45:57.557 --> 02:46:00.858]  I think their GDP was minus 3.2.
[02:46:01.478 --> 02:46:04.438]  Tons of money is flooding out of Hong Kong into Singapore.
[02:46:04.799 --> 02:46:07.959]  It's no longer becoming a trustworthy place to invest.
[02:46:08.619 --> 02:46:11.660]  Of course, the dichotomy is if China rolls in with tanks and
[02:46:12.239 --> 02:46:14.941]  and forces a brutal crackdown Tiananmen Square style.
[02:46:15.201 --> 02:46:21.787]  Hong Kong will never probably recover from that and it will never be a major financial hub ever again.
[02:46:21.907 --> 02:46:24.029]  So these are the high stakes we have right now.
[02:46:24.609 --> 02:46:27.451]  They rotated troops into Hong Kong.
[02:46:27.471 --> 02:46:31.274]  They called it a rotation and several months ago, it wasn't a rotation.
[02:46:31.335 --> 02:46:41.723]  It was actually beefing up the number of Chinese troops within Hong Kong in preparation for this potential crackdown, which again, some people are now saying could be imminent.
[02:46:43.530 --> 02:46:49.994]  Meanwhile, Disney puts outdated cultural depictions trigger warning on old movies.
[02:46:50.674 --> 02:46:54.176]  Because we had the controversy last week over the John Legend song.
[02:46:54.676 --> 02:47:02.621]  He rewrote Baby It's Cold Outside to retract the misogynistic nature of the lyrics.
[02:47:03.642 --> 02:47:07.604]  And what's funny about that is he changed all the lyrics to make it look as if
[02:47:08.732 --> 02:47:11.514]  You know, in the song, there's the relationship between the guy and the girl.
[02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:13.235]  The girl's saying, oh, I should really go home.
[02:47:13.275 --> 02:47:14.856]  He's saying, no, you should stay.
[02:47:14.916 --> 02:47:15.677]  It's cold outside.
[02:47:15.717 --> 02:47:18.098]  That's, of course, rape culture now in 2019.
[02:47:19.259 --> 02:47:24.263]  But they had to change the lyrics of that to such an extent that they changed the entire meaning of the song.
[02:47:24.943 --> 02:47:33.489]  So now it looks like the singer, John Legend in this case, is trying to hide his affair from his wife, who's just arrived home.
[02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:37.371]  By basically telling her to leave, that she has to leave immediately.
[02:47:37.811 --> 02:47:42.334]  So they completely changed the entire premise of the song just to make it woke.
[02:47:42.774 --> 02:47:45.136]  And it actually looks even less woke.
[02:47:45.636 --> 02:47:53.001]  Well, now Disney's new streaming service has included trigger warnings on old movies that caution the viewer about outdated cultural depictions.
[02:47:53.321 --> 02:47:57.283]  Again, genuflecting at the altar of political correctness.
[02:47:57.964 --> 02:47:59.104]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[02:47:59.124 --> 02:48:00.725]  War Room with Owen Troy is coming up next.
[02:48:01.166 --> 02:48:02.366]  Breaking news at summit.news.
[02:48:02.686 --> 02:48:03.287]  Don't go away.

[02:49:04.355 --> 02:49:13.810]  America and the World is Aware!
[02:49:13.950 --> 02:49:15.853]  United Country, Let's Go!
[02:49:17.602 --> 02:49:20.924]  Hillary Clinton is a Chinese Communist leader and a criminal in Texas in the heart of New York!
[02:49:20.944 --> 02:49:22.165]  Obama died as a white in Fighting Bird!
[02:49:22.245 --> 02:49:22.986]  America will never again!
[02:49:23.006 --> 02:49:23.386]  The end of 1984 is 1776!
[02:49:41.578 --> 02:49:44.700]  The answer to 1984 is 1773!
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:53.448]  Hillary Clinton is an enemy of the American people!
[02:50:07.379 --> 02:50:13.502]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of all patriots and nationalists!
[02:50:13.642 --> 02:50:19.686]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who failed to sell our nation out to the tycoons!
[02:50:19.786 --> 02:50:22.107]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal!
[02:50:23.726 --> 02:50:27.688]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people!
[02:50:28.548 --> 02:50:30.308]  America is awake!
[02:50:31.009 --> 02:50:33.070]  America knows what's happening!
[02:50:33.570 --> 02:50:37.151]  And Infowars.com is exposing it!
[02:50:37.811 --> 02:50:39.212]  America is back!
[02:50:39.812 --> 02:50:41.133]  America is back!
[02:50:41.853 --> 02:50:43.133]  America is back!
[02:50:44.014 --> 02:50:45.094]  America is back!
[02:50:55.545 --> 02:51:09.849]  Hillary Clinton is a war criminal and is involved in child sex trafficking out of Navy.
[02:51:20.393 --> 02:51:23.615]  Hillary Clinton is involved with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:51:24.115 --> 02:51:27.997]  Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile aircraft.
[02:51:28.017 --> 02:51:36.381]  Democrats are authoritarian, anti-American criminals that have failed to silence our speech.
[02:51:36.681 --> 02:51:44.025]  Big Tech and the Chi-Coms and Hillary have failed to silence America's speech.
[02:51:49.175 --> 02:51:49.695]  America is back!
[02:51:49.715 --> 02:51:50.936]  America is back!
[02:51:51.036 --> 02:51:51.697]  America is back!
[02:51:51.777 --> 02:51:52.898]  America is back!
[02:51:52.938 --> 02:51:57.301]  Hillary Clinton worked with the child molester Jeffrey Epstein!
[02:51:57.361 --> 02:51:59.902]  Hillary Clinton wants to sexualize our children!
[02:51:59.962 --> 02:52:02.164]  Hillary Clinton is a liar!
[02:52:07.984 --> 02:52:12.365]  Hillary Clinton, who can't even walk, are going down.
[02:52:13.566 --> 02:52:15.366]  Hillary Clinton is a failure.
[02:52:15.706 --> 02:52:18.187]  Your Democratic Party is collapsing.
[02:52:18.367 --> 02:52:22.088]  Every city you control is collapsing into hell.
[02:52:22.609 --> 02:52:27.630]  Everyone is running from the Democrats and their mental illness.
[02:52:27.730 --> 02:52:33.352]  Your so-called power cult, the Democratic Party that founded the KKK, is going down.
[02:52:33.972 --> 02:52:35.413]  The Democrats are KKK!
[02:52:35.473 --> 02:52:36.754]  The Democrats are KKK!
[02:52:36.834 --> 02:52:38.195]  The Democrats are KKK!
[02:52:38.255 --> 02:52:40.397]  The Democrats are KKK!
[02:52:40.457 --> 02:52:42.638]  The Democrats are KKK!
[02:52:42.838 --> 02:52:50.344]  And look, they all agree to call it KKK!
[02:52:50.404 --> 02:52:52.105]  Down with the KKK!
[02:52:52.165 --> 02:52:57.669]  Down with the... Look at this lady, I'm saying, down with the KKK!
[02:52:57.689 --> 02:52:58.709]  And she says, no!
[02:52:58.729 --> 02:53:00.851]  Down with the KKK and Hillary!
[02:53:00.891 --> 02:53:02.192]  Down with the KKK and Hillary!
[02:53:04.534 --> 02:53:07.639]  They tried to lie about their agenda and secretly build it.
[02:53:08.039 --> 02:53:08.800]  That didn't work.
[02:53:09.541 --> 02:53:18.134]  So now they've tried to silence us and then gaslight the population, promoting pedophilia, gun confiscation, and pure evil as normal.
[02:53:18.995 --> 02:53:20.798]  They're doing that to demoralize you.
[02:53:21.158 --> 02:53:22.739]  But the truth is, they're failing.
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:25.101]  You can see it, and you can feel it.
[02:53:25.442 --> 02:53:25.882]  Hell yes!
[02:53:25.982 --> 02:53:26.883]  We're gonna take your AR-15.
[02:53:26.903 --> 02:53:31.187]  You're gonna take people's guns away, wait till you get elected, then take the guns away.
[02:53:31.247 --> 02:53:33.569]  Don't tell them ahead of time!
[02:53:33.609 --> 02:53:42.917]  Breaking news, we have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston public library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:53:43.017 --> 02:53:43.798]  We are winning.
[02:53:45.071 --> 02:53:47.934]  Humanity is awakening to the fact that it's under attack.
[02:53:48.034 --> 02:53:48.955]  We were asleep before.
[02:53:49.676 --> 02:53:55.582]  And the fact that we're awakening enrages the vampiric globalists and their demonic slaves.
[02:53:57.664 --> 02:54:06.253]  Ladies and gentlemen, they wouldn't have come out in the open with gun confiscation, pro-pedophilia, attacks on America, attacks on real Christians.
[02:54:07.472 --> 02:54:09.013]  If they weren't scared and weren't losing.
[02:54:09.033 --> 02:54:15.538]  They've had to fully uncloak themselves in a hope to normalize their assault on our species.
[02:54:15.618 --> 02:54:17.019]  But it's not working.
[02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:22.203]  The fact that they had to censor InfoWars off of more than 60 major platforms.
[02:54:22.844 --> 02:54:30.650]  And then the fact that Zuckerberg had to say, if you say something positive about Alex Jones or about InfoWars, that they'll ban you on Facebook.
[02:54:31.087 --> 02:54:32.609]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:54:32.629 --> 02:54:41.943]  Well, Facebook believes it's so dangerous that you can be banned from using the platform, Facebook, just for sharing its content unless you simultaneously denounce it.
[02:54:42.564 --> 02:54:43.065]  America!
[02:54:44.286 --> 02:54:47.909]  Revolted against that and said, my God, this is like the old Soviet Union.
[02:54:48.509 --> 02:54:57.576]  And now all the big tech companies are coming out with their cashless systems, with the smartphones and the AI systems, the assistants and all the rest of this garbage.
[02:54:58.197 --> 02:55:03.721]  These people are making their move on humanity right now.
[02:55:04.742 --> 02:55:12.148]  But again, if they couldn't be defeated, they wouldn't be trying to censor those of us that are standing up to them.
[02:55:12.608 --> 02:55:26.520]  They know they've got an uphill battle, but their god, their master, whatever the hell this murderous force is, this death cult, is obsessed with driving us into submission and demoralizing us to get rid of our fighting spirit.
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:29.442]  But everybody can see it and everybody can feel it.
[02:55:29.722 --> 02:55:33.525]  That fighting spirit of humanity is beginning to
[02:55:35.350 --> 02:55:38.533]  Burn brighter than it ever has before.
[02:55:38.814 --> 02:55:40.395]  It is exploding.
[02:55:43.559 --> 02:55:55.131]  And the wicked, twisted forces that believed that they were going to have a leisurely dissection of the human species are now beginning to realize that just like every time in the past, evil failed.
[02:55:57.247 --> 02:55:59.049]  They're going to fail this time.
[02:55:59.890 --> 02:56:06.598]  And their attempt to destroy us will only be the final nail in the coffin for their Luciferian system.
[02:56:07.099 --> 02:56:09.842]  That said, I need your prayers.
[02:56:11.223 --> 02:56:12.345]  You need to pray for yourself.
[02:56:13.712 --> 02:56:14.453]  I don't have to tell you that.
[02:56:15.193 --> 02:56:18.775]  I need your word of mouth that is paramount, that is key, that is the coin of the realm.
[02:56:19.676 --> 02:56:24.679]  Human, human intelligence, and I need money to prosecute the war against the globalists.
[02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:29.383]  You know that nobody fights harder than InfoWars because you are behind the InfoWars.
[02:56:29.623 --> 02:56:31.544]  And you've got my commitment to go 110%.
[02:56:31.844 --> 02:56:32.905]  But I need the capital.
[02:56:33.265 --> 02:56:34.967]  I've got a bunch of key initiatives to launch.

[02:56:46.795 --> 02:56:48.055]  InfoWars is resisting.
[02:56:48.236 --> 02:56:49.376]  InfoWars is fighting.
[02:56:49.496 --> 02:56:51.198]  InfoWars wants a pro-human future.
[02:56:51.698 --> 02:56:54.260]  And you are what powers the InfoWars.
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:55.801]  So take action today.
[02:56:56.061 --> 02:56:56.741]  Spread the word.
[02:56:57.002 --> 02:56:57.602]  Pray for us.
[02:56:57.962 --> 02:56:59.763]  And please buy the products.
[02:57:00.024 --> 02:57:00.684]  And I thank you.
[02:57:01.024 --> 02:57:01.725]  And I salute you.
