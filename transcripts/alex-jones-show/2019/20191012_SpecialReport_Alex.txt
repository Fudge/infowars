[00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:16.269]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.492]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:18.134]  Today.
[00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:24.327]  George Soros has penetrated the Trump White House.
[00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:31.190]  Soros has planted a mole infiltrating the national security apparatus.
[00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:48.657]  A woman named Fiona Hill who has a Harvard background has been on the Soros payroll and the payroll of the Open Society Institute has been brought into the Trump White House by General McMaster.
[00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:49.737]  We are about to break
[00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:57.697]  Some extremely important news that affects the Trump presidency, that affects not just our nation, but the world.
[00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:00.041]  This is really huge information.
[00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:04.328]  First off, we know who the second whistleblower is.
[00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.581]  Deep State Mole, George Soros, Hillary Funded and Backed, Fiona Hill.
[00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:11.962]  Now we're not just breaking this now.
[00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:16.264]  Back in July of 2017, Roger Stone was in D.C.
[00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:26.628]  He talked to his contacts and they pointed out that Fiona Hill was bringing in McMaster and all these other people and all these Soros people into the State Department and other agencies.
[00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:30.071]  And that we absolutely had to investigate it and warn Trump.
[00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:31.272]  Well, we didn't investigate it.
[00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:32.753]  We thought it was totally true.
[00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.075]  We began to warn President Trump.
[00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:37.037]  All hell broke loose.
[00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:39.179]  Roger Stone then came back on my show.
[00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.182]  These videos are all posted on InfoWars.com and a big article right now.
[00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.876]  And said, I just got threatened.
[00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:48.177]  I'm told I'm going to be set up and put in prison if I don't back down.
[00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:49.758]  But he said, I'm not backing down.
[00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:50.838]  I don't care.
[00:01:50.958 --> 00:02:00.941]  I just formed an organization called the 45 Group that's going to back Trump and go up against these people that are funding their criminal operations against Trump and America out of Ukraine.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.703]  Because that was a war zone, and so it was a black budget, billions, really a month going in, tens of billions a year, so they were stealing it.
[00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:13.325]  We now get the big picture by hindsight, by having the information then.
[00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:18.187]  So that's why they were so scared, is we were going after the Soros mole inside the White House.
[00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:20.408]  That's why Infowars had to be deplatformed.
[00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:25.190]  It's why all the Hillary Clinton-connected law firms had to sue us, hoping to take us off the air.
[00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.290]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.112]  It's interesting that yesterday, the attorney Larry Klayman
[00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:38.054]  I predicted that I would be targeted for annihilation as part of the Trump takedown.
[00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:40.515]  I am not afraid.
[00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:56.267]  I'm actually here to meet with other Trump loyalists in a new group that we have founded, the membership of which is secret, but we call it the 45 group because we're here to protect and defend our 45th president.
[00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:59.981]  Now, fast forward to what's happening right now.
[00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:05.465]  You see that she's going to testify to Congress, and they're simply calling her.
[00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.547]  They're not saying that she's a whistleblower.
[00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:11.558]  We're told the whistleblowers are CIA and other people from the State Department.
[00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.981]  All they are is partisan hacks who've already put out disinfo before.
[00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:18.683]  Clapper, Brennan, Fiona Hill.
[00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:21.985]  They could say they're whistleblower number one, number two, number ten.
[00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:27.890]  It doesn't matter because they're all the same group using the statement and the name whistleblower
[00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:40.616]  As coverage so they can try to remain secret while they put out false info against Trump claiming he was demanding that Ukraine follow his orders against Biden or not get a billion dollars.
[00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:41.677]  See how that works?
[00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:53.303]  So now they can come testify about what nebulous whistleblowers said when the whistleblowers are just a composite of Trump haters, angry Democrats, globalists that don't want their Ukraine money cut off.
[00:03:53.823 --> 00:04:02.551]  And who don't want to go to prison for what they've done like Biden and Hunter and Pelosi's son involved with the gas company and all the incredible information that's coming out.
[00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:11.179]  So they are turning around and going against Trump with the exact things they've been doing quid pro quo in Ukraine.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.041]  So she is the second, quote, whistleblower.
[00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:15.421]  She could be the third, the fourth, the fifth.
[00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:17.381]  They've got a whole bunch of these angry people lined up.
[00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:20.422]  But again, if they come out, she's known to be a Soros operative.
[00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:21.523]  No one's going to listen.
[00:04:21.903 --> 00:04:25.924]  So they say it's a nebulous secret in the dark whistleblower.
[00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:30.485]  Then she gets called as the independent person who worked for Trump.
[00:04:30.525 --> 00:04:32.105]  And then she confirms it all.
[00:04:32.686 --> 00:04:34.726]  And, well, we have to impeach President Trump.
[00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:40.788]  Even though Trump had the transcript, even though Trump has all the witnesses, they think that a whole bunch of other
[00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:42.378]  We're good to go.
[00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.970]  Adam Schiff over the committee and others that have put all this together.
[00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.811]  We know that it's all come out now.
[00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:08.693]  It's come out that they were already preparing the impeachment the very same day that the letter was being written.
[00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:10.874]  This is the death of due process.
[00:05:10.914 --> 00:05:13.255]  This is the death of checks and balances.
[00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:18.957]  This is the death of the separation of powers in our government if this takes place and if this happens.
[00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:22.959]  But again at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com there's two big articles
[00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:24.040]  We're good.
[00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:50.273]  We couldn't even search it on Google or YouTube and find them.
[00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:58.114]  We had to go to Bing and DuckDuckGo and do the exact searches and then find the videos that others had copied onto YouTube.
[00:05:58.774 --> 00:06:15.758]  So it's critical that you get all of our reports, even if you have a small channel, and copy them there as well because they are taking these videos down, ladies and gentlemen, because it shows that she is partisan, she is a hack, she works for George Soros, she was identified as a mole by InfoWars, by Roger Stone, to plus
[00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:16.859]  Years ago.
[00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:22.743]  And now the system is coming after us with everything they've got because we're just loyal Americans exposing this.
[00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:25.605]  We've also got to get this report out to the President.
[00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:28.627]  We've got to tweet this at the President, at Don Jr.
[00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:34.872]  and others because their big fear, if you remember, was keeping Infowars back in 2017-18 away from Trump.
[00:06:35.252 --> 00:06:41.697]  And when Kelly was brought in, his main job was, quote, keeping Infowars, because it was so fake and so false and so evil, away from Trump.
[00:06:41.757 --> 00:06:42.398]  No, the truth was,
[00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:47.503]  We had real people in Washington, in the State Department, in the Pentagon.
[00:06:47.883 --> 00:06:50.126]  We had the real connections through Roger Stone and many others.
[00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:51.327]  We still have a lot of those connections.
[00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.410]  It's very, very dangerous because everybody else is scared.
[00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.411]  Everybody else knows this stuff.
[00:06:56.308 --> 00:07:05.535]  But they're all around Trump telling him that they're on his side, pledging allegiance to America, saying they're loyal, and then they use that to then lie about the president and lie about others.
[00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:08.017]  And Roger is facing, in three weeks, trial.
[00:07:08.618 --> 00:07:10.159]  Decades in prison for nothing.
[00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:11.820]  There is no Russiagate, that's all fake.
[00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:18.786]  The court even ruled, well, it's been proven that Russiagate didn't happen, and there's no proof that Russians hacked emails, but that can't be shown to the jury.
[00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:22.048]  He's being tried in the swamp in Washington, D.C.
[00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.310]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.170]  They're trying to plant child porn on us.
[00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.991]  People say, well, we better back off.
[00:07:28.111 --> 00:07:28.331]  No.
[00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:31.112]  You stand up to tyrants, you have a free country.
[00:07:31.392 --> 00:07:33.233]  Everybody kisses their ass and backs down.
[00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:34.153]  We all get enslaved.
[00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:41.776]  So we played a few clips here of Roger from July of 2000 and from June and July of 2017.
[00:07:42.297 --> 00:07:45.058]  There's also some clips I want to play with Ted Malik.
[00:07:45.578 --> 00:07:52.321]  Who was one of the main organizers of the Davos Group, when he was on with Roger, breaking down all the things that happened as well.
[00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:58.583]  And Roger, in some of these interviews, talks about how, again, he's been specifically threatened that he'll be set up if he does it back down.
[00:07:58.903 --> 00:07:59.704]  And then it all happened.
[00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.965]  And then Malik got grabbed by the FBI.
[00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:04.466]  And they threatened him to tell a bunch of lies, but he wouldn't do it.
[00:08:05.387 --> 00:08:09.231]  So, this is very serious and that's why they wanted InfoWars off the air.
[00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:20.742]  But we still have Band.Video, we still have InfoWars.com, and we're still able to get these videos out if you will share them on your email, on your text message, and by word of mouth.
[00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:27.430]  And yes, at Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, because Band Off Video isn't as blacklisted as InfoWars, you're still able to share that.
[00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.374]  But this information has to get out, and only you can get it out.
[00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:40.526]  Again, flood Trump's Twitter, flood the campaign, flood them so that President Trump understands who is doing all this, and the lady that's about to testify against him,
[00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:45.611]  And who is saying in the press that, oh yeah, she knows it was quid pro quo and she has all this evidence.
[00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:47.873]  She was already gone before all of this even happened.
[00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:49.354]  It's all a fraud.
[00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:54.879]  And so again, we are the private intelligence agency for the American people and for President Trump.
[00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:59.923]  We are loyal, we are organic, we are independent, and we have a fighting spirit and will not back down.
[00:09:00.243 --> 00:09:05.488]  But InfoWars needs your prayers and your financial support as well because the globalists are going to fight for this.
[00:09:05.508 --> 00:09:07.690]  They're not going to give us our freedom back without a serious fight.
[00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.171]  And so that's why it's important.
[00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:18.477]  Your word of mouth, your financial support, buying the great products, InfoWarsTore.com, and your prayers is so essential, not just for President Trump, who needs it as well, but for America and for InfoWars.
[00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.698]  I'm really proud of Roger Stone.
[00:09:19.998 --> 00:09:20.959]  I'm proud of our crew.
[00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:24.922]  We're here working hard, you know, on a Saturday to bring you this information.
[00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:28.224]  And so again, please spread the articles and please spread this report because
[00:09:29.457 --> 00:09:32.399]  She's Whistleblower 1, 2, 5, 10, 100, 1,000.
[00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:33.840]  It's all the same people.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.540]  It's all crap.
[00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:35.541]  It's all made up.
[00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:37.442]  They use that term like dossier.
[00:09:37.683 --> 00:09:39.344]  Oh, we have the Piscate dossier.
[00:09:39.484 --> 00:09:40.544]  It's a fancy word.
[00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:42.246]  And it's all nebulous crap.
[00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:44.087]  And now it's, oh, the whistleblower.
[00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:45.888]  Oh, they have to testify in secret.
[00:09:46.108 --> 00:09:47.129]  No one can see their faces.
[00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.030]  But Trump has no rights.
[00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.492]  This is the crazy kangaroo court stuff the Democrats are engaged in.
[00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:59.117]  And until the real indictments start, and until we start taking action, until Trump takes action, these criminals are only going to be emboldened.
[00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:02.758]  But until the end, we're going to continue fighting on thanks to all your support.
[00:10:02.778 --> 00:10:09.661]  So please spread this breaking news right now about the attempted coup, part three against our president.
[00:10:10.022 --> 00:10:10.702]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:10:10.822 --> 00:10:11.522]  Thank you for watching.
[00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:26.504]  Improbably working for the Trump administration, served as an advisor to the Open Society Institute for seven years.
[00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:32.627]  She has a lifetime membership in the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:35.488]  She is a Harvard graduate.
[00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:40.351]  Does this sound like somebody who should be serving in the Trump White House?
