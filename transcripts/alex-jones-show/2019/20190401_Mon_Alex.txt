[00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.511]  It's April 1st, 2019.
[00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.293]  And the left has pulled a lot of April Fool's jokes on us.
[00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.354]  They say it's okay that Joe Biden likes to grope women because it only happened once.
[00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:19.056]  The shocking evidence, it'll bring him down straight ahead.
[00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:21.016]  And so much more, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:28.100]  But first, let's get to this key report and look at how everything The Globalist is touching is falling apart, just like with AOC.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.381]  After reading the Green New Deal,
[00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:36.479]  I'm mostly afraid of not being able to get through this speech with a straight face.
[00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:45.162]  The Green New Deal finally landed its impossible $100 trillion tax-dollar country-killing behemoth on the floor of the U.S.
[00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:45.502]  Senate.
[00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:53.265]  Its main sponsor, freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, had set the table at a House committee meeting.
[00:00:53.505 --> 00:01:01.088]  Flailing around with Beto-esque zeal, AOC passionately pretended to have a grip on the science of climate change.
[00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.066]  This is not an elitist issue.
[00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:06.307]  This is a quality of life issue.
[00:01:06.607 --> 00:01:13.249]  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist?
[00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.172]  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.
[00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:22.053]  Even Cortez's asthma claims fell short.
[00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:23.213]  I don't think so.
[00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:24.854]  I don't think so.
[00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:46.979]  Fox Business host Charles Payne cited several studies, including a Columbia University study from 2013 that stated cockroach and mouse allergens are more common in lower-income housing and neighborhoods, as well as a New York Times study from 2003 in which social workers said they encountered furniture and carpets covered in dust in the Bronx and Harlem.
[00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.680]  These two studies show the likely culprit behind the asthma Cortez was flailing about.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:04.267]  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis, and notably here, a founding member of the Super Friends.
[00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:11.471]  I draw your attention, Mr. President, to the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.
[00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.254]  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.
[00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:25.097]  Now, I'm the first to admit that a massive fleet of giant, highly trained seahorses would be cool.
[00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:27.198]  It would be really, really awesome.
[00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:31.259]  But we have to consider a few things.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.982]  We have no idea about scalability or domestic capacity in this sector.
[00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:43.365]  The last thing we want is to ban all airplanes.
[00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:56.664]  And only then find out that China or Russia may have already established strategic hippocampus programs designed to cut the United States out of the global market.
[00:02:58.322 --> 00:03:04.087]  Mr. President, we must not allow and cannot tolerate a giant seahorse gap.
[00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:11.193]  Every Democratic senator who is currently running for president has embraced the Green New Deal.
[00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:16.197]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sprung the vote on the reluctant Democrats
[00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:33.305]  Some of which, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kirsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Angus King of Maine sided with the Republicans by voting no, while 43 of the Democrats hid behind procedure by merely voting present.
[00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:44.630]  A show of cold feet amongst Senate Democratic presidential candidates with zero guts to back up the madness of Cortez, who blamed McConnell for the resounding defeat in a tweet.
[00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:57.214]  In the end, AOC's United Nations Agenda 2030 climate change scheme, known now as the Green New Deal, was voted down with zero yeas and 57 nays.
[00:03:57.534 --> 00:03:58.835]  You know, we talk about cost.
[00:04:00.235 --> 00:04:03.777]  We're going to pay for this whether we pass a Green New Deal or not.
[00:04:05.257 --> 00:04:13.380]  A no vote on the Green New Deal is a vote against a government takeover of our economy,
[00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:23.972]  That would stifle economic growth, bankrupt our nation, and endanger the prosperity of all Americans.
[00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:35.475]  A no vote is a vote in favor of continuing an open and free economy that has made America the richest country in the world.
[00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:41.856]  And we find that the best way to do environmental improvement
[00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:47.330]  is to use the wealth of a nation to accomplish that goal.
[00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.734]  Better luck next time, Cortez, if there is a next time.
[00:04:52.435 --> 00:04:57.380]  One year ago, I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.081]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:01.204 --> 00:05:05.448]  I mean, I've explained this.
[00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:07.490]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of
[00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:17.427]  Social media last year saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state and just said I did it.
[00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:24.993]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:42.996]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:46.769]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.271]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:51.252]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[00:05:51.272 --> 00:05:53.574]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.356]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[00:05:57.837 --> 00:05:59.238]  All I have is you supporting us.
[00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:05.241]  That's all I have.
[00:06:05.322 --> 00:06:08.864]  ...language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:18.486]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum!
[00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:19.126]  Russian scum!
[00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:19.686]  Listen.
[00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:20.386]  Please listen.
[00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:22.507]  If you don't, if you won't,
[00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:37.995]  If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will striken you!
[00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:41.216]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.256]  Sleep.
[00:06:44.556 --> 00:06:45.336]  Sleep.
[00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:47.097]  Sleep.
[00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:48.097]  Oh my God!
[00:06:48.197 --> 00:06:48.597]  Oh my God!
[00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:49.317]  Oh my God!
[00:06:49.377 --> 00:06:50.117]  Lock the door!
[00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:50.617]  Lock the door!
[00:06:50.638 --> 00:06:51.218]  They're coming!
[00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:52.498]  They're coming!
[00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:53.058]  Help!
[00:06:53.398 --> 00:06:53.758]  Help!
[00:06:54.138 --> 00:06:54.818]  They're coming!
[00:06:55.058 --> 00:06:55.738]  They're coming!
[00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:56.459]  Listen to me!
[00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:57.099]  Listen!
[00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.639]  Help me!
[00:06:59.126 --> 00:06:59.467]  You're next!
[00:06:59.567 --> 00:06:59.687]  Please!
[00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:00.167]  Please!
[00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:00.867]  You're next!
[00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:01.768]  They're in danger!
[00:07:01.968 --> 00:07:02.809]  Please, listen to me!
[00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.909]  Something terrible!
[00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.510]  Please!
[00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.310]  You're next!
[00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.291]  Here they are!
[00:07:09.173 --> 00:07:09.733]  They're already here!
[00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:10.233]  Come!
[00:07:10.273 --> 00:07:10.954]  You're next!
[00:07:10.994 --> 00:07:11.374]  They're coming!
[00:07:11.394 --> 00:07:12.455]  They're coming!
[00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:14.496]  The seed is planted.
[00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:17.678]  Terror grows.
[00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:20.160]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.280]  That's you when you slink!
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.861]  Sit up!
[00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.343]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:28.800]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.900]  Is it contagious?
[00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:32.142]  It looked right at me.
[00:07:32.362 --> 00:07:35.705]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:36.485]  I'm not human.
[00:07:38.787 --> 00:07:41.789]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:43.831]  We're being cornered!
[00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:47.534]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:08:18.402 --> 00:08:20.523]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:26.266]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:34.671]  If you go up to InfoWars.com, you'll see articles put together by us.
[00:08:36.372 --> 00:08:38.893]  Videos five years ago, six years ago.
[00:08:38.913 --> 00:08:41.575]  You'll see Paul Watson's video from a couple years ago.
[00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:43.776]  Creepy Uncle Joe Biden.
[00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:50.188]  We first began to point out that Joe Biden can't keep his hands off any little girls or any women.
[00:08:50.788 --> 00:08:55.332]  Runs his fingers through their hair, kisses them, rubs their sides, rubs their buttocks.
[00:08:56.052 --> 00:09:08.642]  And if you look at the big composite image up on the front page of DrugsReport.com, you zoom in, it's all the different faces, or at least some of them, of the girls crying in one shot.
[00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:11.019]  The woman is playing a flute.
[00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:12.600]  It's probably one of the most haunting videos.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:22.107]  And for several minutes, he's behind her while she's playing, rubbing her butt while he whispers God knows what in his ear.
[00:09:22.927 --> 00:09:26.930]  And she begins to cry, still playing the flute.
[00:09:29.752 --> 00:09:33.094]  There are videos of parents pulling their children away from him.
[00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:34.615]  Children recoiling.
[00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:39.319]  Him pulling women down to sit in his lap and then putting his hands on their hips.
[00:09:42.577 --> 00:09:44.578]  It's how you get in a fight with somebody.
[00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:52.841]  I mean, if somebody's been your buddy for 20 years and he pulled your wife down on his lap when he came over for a beer and started patting on her hips, you might say, hey, Bob.
[00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:55.762]  Get a little friendly there.
[00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:58.643]  Get your hands off my wife's ass.
[00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:00.564]  Excuse my French.
[00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:02.965]  That is unless you're swingers.
[00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:04.625]  Then get your wife over here.
[00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:07.506]  You're gonna have to share.
[00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:09.407]  I mean, the point is, is that
[00:10:11.596 --> 00:10:12.757]  This guy's out of control!
[00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:36.012]  And Bernie Sanders comes out, and Bernie Sanders defends him and says it only happened once, because it's on video that this very attractive Hispanic lady of the Democratic Party, running for a higher office, she's been a state rep, he starts grabbing her on the podium and kissing her and whispering in her ear and rubbing under her chin.
[00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:40.675]  I mean, if your wife's not in the mood, if she's not in a good mood,
[00:10:42.588 --> 00:10:45.310]  And you come over and start talking to your wife, she's like, I'm not in the mood, leave me alone.
[00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.052]  I mean, you don't just approach your wife like that.
[00:10:51.293 --> 00:10:55.015]  But, oh, just do it to random women and people's kids.
[00:10:58.898 --> 00:11:07.222]  I mean, if my wife is trying to get groceries out of the car, look, my wife loves me, as always, you know, likes me, and is a very attentive wife and very excited about me.
[00:11:07.263 --> 00:11:09.144]  But if she's getting groceries out of the car,
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.062]  And pulling the baby out of the back and I come over and grab her by the butt, which, you know, I do that kind of stuff.
[00:11:14.082 --> 00:11:15.103]  She's like, hey, knock it off.
[00:11:15.783 --> 00:11:16.584]  I'm busy right now.
[00:11:16.644 --> 00:11:17.944]  It's just not the time for it.
[00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:33.833]  Imagine you're playing the flute or you're up on a stage and Joe Biden comes up behind you and starts rubbing your face and rubbing under your chin and then whispering in your ear and then gets behind you and starts rubbing your butt.
[00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.096]  It's all about a power and control thing.
[00:11:39.724 --> 00:11:42.985]  And that you're in this public arena and you don't know what to do.
[00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:50.667]  And that he always walks up behind the children and starts rubbing his hands through their hair.
[00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:54.888]  Very sexually.
[00:11:57.788 --> 00:12:08.491]  Imagine if somebody at a park walked up to your 10-year-old daughter or your 5-year-old daughter and stood up behind him and then started rubbing his hands on your shoulders and rubbing the hands on through the hair.
[00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:18.464]  I mean, if the kids are running around screaming and yelling in the house like they do sometimes, and my wife's over there chopping up onions, say, for a salad.
[00:12:18.624 --> 00:12:19.145]  She's busy.
[00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:20.507]  She's not in the mode.
[00:12:22.512 --> 00:12:23.333]  of being approached.
[00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:30.416]  I don't know what it is about your wife in the kitchen or something, or doing things, but you know, they're cute, they're doing stuff, you come up behind them and start rubbing on them and kissing on them.
[00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:33.698]  And you know, most of the time she's like, okay, great, let's get in the bedroom in five minutes.
[00:12:33.758 --> 00:12:36.119]  But most of the time it's like, hey, I'm busy.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.840]  It's just not the mode for it.
[00:12:38.521 --> 00:12:46.105]  So again, men don't treat their wives on average the way Biden treats women in public.
[00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:53.599]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.360]  And then again, it's bigger than Biden, the front runner of the Democratic Party right now, almost all polls show.
[00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:02.061]  It's that he gets away with it.
[00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:04.301]  He's been known to do this for decades.
[00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:11.543]  I know the guy who sold them the property, the wooded property right next to their bar.
[00:13:13.123 --> 00:13:17.024]  And he told me some stories, but it just fits in to everything else.
[00:13:21.337 --> 00:13:23.919]  It just fits in to everything we know about this guy.
[00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:28.602]  And how the Democratic Party is now defending him.
[00:13:28.963 --> 00:13:39.570]  Imagine if we had footage of Kavanaugh walking up to random women on stages and standing behind them and clearly rubbing on their butts and running his hands through their hair.
[00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.911]  We'd say, this guy's a creepozoid.
[00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:46.836]  By the way, I would never even think about doing something like this, but
[00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:51.021]  You go up and start touching on people's wives and stuff in public?
[00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:52.962]  When you know their husbands are in the audience?
[00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:54.443]  It's a good way to get your ass kicked!
[00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:56.585]  I mean, let me tell you.
[00:13:57.005 --> 00:14:04.070]  If I was sitting there and I was at some public event and I looked 20 yards away and a guy's rubbing his hands through my wife's hair and I walk over and say, is this an old boyfriend?
[00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.690]  What the hell?
[00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.153]  Of course, my wife would be like, what are you doing?
[00:14:08.173 --> 00:14:08.973]  And push the guy away.
[00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:11.995]  That's the normal instinct.
[00:14:12.015 --> 00:14:15.698]  Yeah, there he is rubbing a woman's stomach up to under her breast.
[00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:18.367]  So creepy, man.
[00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:23.189]  That's a creepy way he does it.
[00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:26.110]  I mean, I guarantee you, women, even if you were married to him, don't like that.
[00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:29.471]  So I'm going to go over all this and so much more.
[00:14:29.512 --> 00:14:31.412]  The Globals are planning to try to overthrow the president.
[00:14:32.613 --> 00:14:33.473]  We've got their next plan.
[00:14:33.493 --> 00:14:35.474]  I'm going to exclusively break that down coming up.
[00:14:35.554 --> 00:14:37.034]  Put out a special report last night on it.
[00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:38.455]  It's up here until about 8 o'clock.
[00:14:38.975 --> 00:14:42.836]  That special report, that's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.

[00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:41.996]  Most of these products are lost leaders.
[00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:43.057]  I mean, I've explained this.
[00:18:43.077 --> 00:18:44.839]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of
[00:19:07.088 --> 00:19:15.879]  Social media last year saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state and just said I did it.
[00:19:17.181 --> 00:19:23.429]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:41.452]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:19:43.075 --> 00:19:45.216]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:47.696]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[00:19:48.477 --> 00:19:49.677]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[00:19:49.697 --> 00:19:51.998]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:54.799]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.719]  All I have is you supporting us.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.440]  That's all I have.
[00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:09.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:25.067]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:39.679]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.563]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space.
[00:20:43.923 --> 00:20:48.024]  Where people aren't extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:20:48.244 --> 00:20:52.266]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:20:53.046 --> 00:21:09.171]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.071]  InfoWars.
[00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:11.952]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:21:18.632 --> 00:21:24.936]  All right, let me tell you some of the big news that's coming up.
[00:21:25.016 --> 00:21:35.522]  And again, I don't like to be gonzo journalism, but it's getting pretty crazy at this point, and I'm not even sure what's going on now.
[00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:48.130]  But, Saturday, Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke's hair really supposed to say it, but I just have fun with it, had rallies in Houston,
[00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.153]  in Dallas, El Paso and a bunch of places.
[00:21:52.914 --> 00:22:02.025]  And then at 1030 at night, he arrived to downtown Austin in front of the Capitol.
[00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:08.012]  And around the Capitol, there's a parking lots in areas, it's very, very dark.
[00:22:09.053 --> 00:22:09.714]  And I say that
[00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:25.641]  Because in the footage we have that we put on Infowars.com, you see some of the crazy leftists, but you can't really see that Beto is only about 70 yards from where I am standing.
[00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:30.243]  He's probably only got a crowd of about maximum 2,500.
[00:22:30.743 --> 00:22:33.204]  So the media called it 5,000-10,000.
[00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:40.007]  But I thought I could go with just three security guys and one with Owen separately.
[00:22:41.312 --> 00:22:44.794]  Up to the front.
[00:22:44.814 --> 00:22:45.594]  50 yards away or so.
[00:22:46.395 --> 00:22:46.895]  30 yards away.
[00:22:48.096 --> 00:22:50.337]  We were about 60, 70 yards to the side of the stage.
[00:22:50.377 --> 00:22:51.677]  I thought I could go up into it.
[00:22:52.418 --> 00:22:54.619]  And it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:55.679]  And we have the audio of this.
[00:22:55.699 --> 00:22:56.680]  We're going to be putting out later.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.341]  But it's so dark in the crowd.
[00:22:58.401 --> 00:22:59.201]  There's so much cussing.
[00:23:00.382 --> 00:23:02.503]  And you hear most of the voice going, oh, look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:02.543 --> 00:23:03.443]  Look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:04.024 --> 00:23:06.045]  But then there's a platform of media
[00:23:07.361 --> 00:23:09.442]  Up above me and they point and they go, it's him!
[00:23:09.662 --> 00:23:10.182]  Get him!
[00:23:10.943 --> 00:23:13.704]  And some of this audio is actually in the two videos they've put out.
[00:23:14.324 --> 00:23:16.145]  But it's just crazy.
[00:23:16.165 --> 00:23:18.486]  And then people start going, get him!
[00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:19.226]  Get him!
[00:23:19.486 --> 00:23:20.006]  Get him!
[00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:23.688]  And there's women slapping at the security people and trying to get at me.
[00:23:24.428 --> 00:23:25.609]  So we get out of the crowd.
[00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.531]  And we get about 70 yards away to the side.
[00:23:32.042 --> 00:23:35.543]  And then as soon as Beto gets there, I start bullhorning.
[00:23:36.223 --> 00:23:39.604]  Reportedly, you could hear it over him at many points.
[00:23:39.624 --> 00:23:40.444]  It was very effective.
[00:23:41.304 --> 00:23:49.507]  And a couple hundred people rush out of the thousands up to where I am on a little bit of an incline and start trying to physically attack us.
[00:23:50.227 --> 00:23:54.668]  And I mean foaming at the mouth like I had killed their children.
[00:23:55.688 --> 00:23:58.209]  And I'd say, Beto O'Rourke supports killing babies after they're born.
[00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:03.422]  And they would just scream, yes, we love it, we love killing babies, FU, FU.
[00:24:04.163 --> 00:24:10.132]  And just the level of vicious hate was unlike anything I'd ever seen.
[00:24:11.173 --> 00:24:15.159]  And that's before I was ever even bullhorning.
[00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:32.727]  Again, my security guys got slapped in the head, they slapped me a few times, and it was hard to get footage of any of it because it was just such a melee, they'd also come up behind you.
[00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:40.069]  But we got some of it on tape, but just to know the absolute raw hate.
[00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:46.151]  Like, I used to think it was cheesy when people would chant USA, USA, unless it was the Olympics or something.
[00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:51.102]  Because I get there's a USA version out there that means kind of US Empire launch wars.
[00:24:51.142 --> 00:24:52.123]  I don't like that USA.
[00:24:52.143 --> 00:24:53.184]  I like the real USA.
[00:24:54.085 --> 00:25:05.194]  But I learned in the last few years around leftists, their radicalization under Obama and the universities is so complete that I would say, hey, America's back.
[00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:08.536]  Trump is really getting jobs back.
[00:25:08.617 --> 00:25:14.521]  And I learned this about two years ago when I would go out to Democrat events and they would all go into a rage.
[00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:16.570]  I'm sure screaming and cussing.
[00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:26.515]  In fact, I could be in front of a moderately normal liberal cloud and I'd be speaking or bullhorning at an event that Hillary was going into or what have you.
[00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:32.418]  But as soon as I'd say, America is back or America is good,
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.141]  Or, we should all love the country.
[00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:43.189]  That's what makes these people just go... I mean, we're talking about radicalized people.
[00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:49.174]  I don't think the North Koreans, with all their brainwashing, when they protest the U.S.
[00:25:49.254 --> 00:25:49.694]  act like this.
[00:25:49.734 --> 00:25:50.355]  In fact, they don't.
[00:25:54.258 --> 00:25:55.279]  They just go out and march around.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.723]  This is beyond 10 minutes of hate in 1984, where
[00:26:01.502 --> 00:26:09.006]  They would flash Emanuel Goldstein, the supposed bad guy, up on the screens at these public events you had to go to every day in these movie theaters.
[00:26:09.686 --> 00:26:12.247]  And then you would just scream for 10 minutes going, AHHHHH!
[00:26:12.627 --> 00:26:13.928]  AHHHHH!
[00:26:15.569 --> 00:26:20.211]  And I've had five people come up to me
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.583]  Yesterday and today, when I brought it up at the office, people in the meeting this morning were like, yeah, I saw that too.
[00:26:27.223 --> 00:26:28.864]  No one watches Spectrum News.
[00:26:28.944 --> 00:26:29.845]  It's Time Warner.
[00:26:29.905 --> 00:26:30.625]  It's CNN.
[00:26:30.645 --> 00:26:31.546]  It used to be called News 8.
[00:26:32.106 --> 00:26:35.328]  In most cities now, they have a local, you know, CNN propaganda news group.
[00:26:35.388 --> 00:26:36.068]  Very low quality.
[00:26:38.249 --> 00:26:41.331]  And I don't watch a lot of TV, but we do have Spectrum.
[00:26:42.812 --> 00:26:46.113]  And I shouldn't have it, but the point is, the house has it.
[00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:50.476]  And I turn it on, and my daughter likes to sometimes, you know, watch a movie at like 8 at night.
[00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:55.327]  I don't watch cartoons with her, so that's what we do.
[00:26:56.528 --> 00:26:58.689]  And when you turn on the cable, Spectrum's on.
[00:26:58.989 --> 00:26:59.770]  It's the first channel.
[00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:09.215]  And in the last few months, we've probably only watched TV 10 times, but every time I turn it on, I'm like, is that a coincidence?
[00:27:09.315 --> 00:27:11.617]  It's Alex Jones, or I'm on the scroll at the bottom.
[00:27:12.837 --> 00:27:19.101]  So Pat Riley, who works here, he broke his foot a few weeks ago, so his wife had to have a baby, so they're at home all weekend.
[00:27:20.247 --> 00:27:23.670]  And he said, Alex, I just left it on in the kitchen with the sound off.
[00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.452]  You were on three times an hour to four times an hour.
[00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:29.815]  He even taped some of it or DVR'd it.
[00:27:30.435 --> 00:27:31.937]  Folks, I'm on every channel now.
[00:27:31.977 --> 00:27:35.319]  I'm on MSNBC, Every Hour, CNN, everywhere.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.582]  And everything they're saying is twisted or lies.
[00:27:39.122 --> 00:27:40.684]  And I don't know what they're building towards.
[00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.331]  Because they're almost attacking me as much as Trump now.
[00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:46.051]  It's like they've decided I'm Trump.
[00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:50.232]  And because they can't beat Trump, they think they're going to destroy me.
[00:27:50.332 --> 00:27:52.093]  And it's building towards something bad.
[00:27:52.113 --> 00:27:56.874]  I mean, there's no doubt that everyone's walking up to me going, you're all over TV.
[00:27:56.934 --> 00:27:58.074]  It's like you're on everywhere.
[00:27:58.094 --> 00:28:00.855]  I had people at a restaurant yesterday, at a toy store yesterday.
[00:28:02.596 --> 00:28:04.376]  One of my neighbors this morning came over and talked to me.
[00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:05.777]  Pat brought it up.
[00:28:05.837 --> 00:28:06.897]  People in the meeting brought it up.
[00:28:07.708 --> 00:28:09.129]  It's like, man, you're all over TV.
[00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:12.930]  I was like at a restaurant, and Spectrum's on, and you were on repeatedly.
[00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:15.911]  Zimmerman saw that.
[00:28:17.852 --> 00:28:19.232]  And it's all bull, too.
[00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:26.395]  Like, we had two lawsuits against me of the 20 or so, down to like six.
[00:28:28.095 --> 00:28:29.776]  We had two lawsuits thrown out last Friday.
[00:28:30.736 --> 00:28:32.557]  It was in local news, and that's it.
[00:28:33.297 --> 00:28:35.778]  But, they advanced some of the Sandy Hook stuff,
[00:28:37.398 --> 00:28:39.979]  It'll take them years, even if they're successful in their fraud.
[00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:41.900]  That is the lawyers and the big backer.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.000]  We now know who the big backer is.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.160]  That'll be released soon.
[00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:45.421]  It'll be big news.
[00:28:46.421 --> 00:28:50.103]  And... There was no coverage of us winning those.
[00:28:50.143 --> 00:28:52.343]  But the point is, something big's coming.
[00:28:52.423 --> 00:28:53.384]  And I think I know what it is.
[00:28:53.424 --> 00:28:54.964]  I'm gonna talk about that when we come back.
[00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:56.665]  Then we're gonna get into all the other huge news.
[00:28:57.545 --> 00:28:58.366]  Huge news in Europe.
[00:28:58.386 --> 00:28:58.946]  Please stay with us.
[00:29:02.933 --> 00:29:05.934]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:29:06.314 --> 00:29:12.216]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:29:12.636 --> 00:29:18.517]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:29:18.817 --> 00:29:21.458]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:29:21.738 --> 00:29:29.247]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:37.476]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[00:29:38.077 --> 00:29:42.342]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.822]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:29:47.002 --> 00:29:52.966]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[00:29:53.947 --> 00:30:02.812]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[00:30:03.352 --> 00:30:07.535]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:09.276]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[00:30:10.401 --> 00:30:12.184]  It's the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[00:30:12.204 --> 00:30:13.526]  It was the last run.
[00:30:13.546 --> 00:30:14.488]  It's been sold out for two months.
[00:30:15.575 --> 00:30:16.436]  How is X2 back?
[00:30:16.896 --> 00:30:20.538]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.081]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage we couldn't get anymore.
[00:30:24.681 --> 00:30:34.708]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[00:30:34.788 --> 00:30:38.711]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:40.272]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:30:40.692 --> 00:30:45.034]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[00:30:45.494 --> 00:30:47.295]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:48.995]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[00:30:49.536 --> 00:30:51.797]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[00:30:52.397 --> 00:30:54.598]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[00:30:55.218 --> 00:30:58.699]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.001]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[00:31:03.047 --> 00:31:05.349]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[00:31:05.829 --> 00:31:18.197]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[00:31:18.698 --> 00:31:21.219]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.920]  So iodine is amazing.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.521]  It's important.
[00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:25.782]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[00:31:25.862 --> 00:31:26.363]  They'll hurt you.
[00:31:26.743 --> 00:31:27.443]  This is pure.
[00:31:27.724 --> 00:31:28.424]  This is clean.
[00:31:28.764 --> 00:31:29.545]  This is amazing.
[00:31:29.865 --> 00:31:31.666]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[00:31:33.187 --> 00:31:36.828]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[00:31:37.148 --> 00:31:41.889]  X2 Original, from the very first original manufacturer.
[00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:48.851]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsTore.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:20.165]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:23.828]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:32:24.748 --> 00:32:34.975]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:32:35.735 --> 00:32:44.301]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:32:45.922 --> 00:32:54.444]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:32:59.245 --> 00:33:00.525]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:29.742]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.643 --> 00:33:31.443]  Alright, so...
[00:33:54.443 --> 00:33:56.303]  Remember, like, last year, Frank called in.
[00:33:56.343 --> 00:33:57.864]  He's since called in, and, you know, we've made up.
[00:33:59.144 --> 00:34:01.104]  He said, man, all you ever do is bragging about yourself.
[00:34:01.824 --> 00:34:04.105]  Dude, I'm not bragging about myself.
[00:34:06.565 --> 00:34:08.145]  I do not like the position I'm in.
[00:34:08.225 --> 00:34:09.025]  It's not fun.
[00:34:09.566 --> 00:34:13.726]  But I do like the fact that the globalists are in trouble, and their system is being exposed.
[00:34:13.846 --> 00:34:20.527]  When we become one of the main focal news stories by the globalists, they've got a big reason for it.
[00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:23.608]  A big, big, big reason for it.
[00:34:25.171 --> 00:34:27.472]  And I figured out the reason I know the larger plan.
[00:34:27.672 --> 00:34:29.153]  And I now know the timeline.
[00:34:29.554 --> 00:34:32.235]  And now I'm learning who the parties are and the exact players.
[00:34:32.975 --> 00:34:34.256]  And this is how we beat them.
[00:34:35.017 --> 00:34:38.899]  You don't think I'm on every news show every day now for no reason.
[00:34:42.061 --> 00:34:50.585]  They've got a larger plan to destroy me and then tag it onto the Liberty Movement worldwide in some larger defeat.
[00:34:51.186 --> 00:34:53.267]  They are branding me as the villain.
[00:34:55.643 --> 00:34:56.483]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:34:57.344 --> 00:35:05.627]  Three times an hour, 24 hours a day, most days, on Time Warner Cable, now changed their name to Spectrum.
[00:35:06.247 --> 00:35:07.027]  That's the CNN.
[00:35:07.307 --> 00:35:09.128]  CNN runs and controls the station.
[00:35:11.729 --> 00:35:13.630]  They have Smirkonish and all these guys.
[00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.651]  People say, well, play the clips.
[00:35:15.911 --> 00:35:17.311]  There's like 10 of them a day.
[00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.032]  I can't even spend time watching them.
[00:35:23.786 --> 00:35:26.387]  And they say in the clips, he is a premeditated liar.
[00:35:26.747 --> 00:35:28.688]  Everything he says is consciously not true.
[00:35:28.948 --> 00:35:30.089]  He is a scam artist.
[00:35:30.769 --> 00:35:33.450]  And of course, everything he's saying is about himself.
[00:35:36.031 --> 00:35:37.172]  They say the same thing about Trump.
[00:35:37.272 --> 00:35:38.232]  Oh, he's a liar.
[00:35:38.252 --> 00:35:40.713]  And they'll show like 20 containers of gumballs.
[00:35:41.173 --> 00:35:45.235]  And they go, every one of these gumballs is a liar, according to PolitiFact.
[00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:51.338]  And then everything they say Trump's lying about is not true.
[00:35:52.529 --> 00:35:55.932]  I've never seen a president deliver this much of what he said he'd do.
[00:35:57.673 --> 00:36:00.375]  People said it's not expedient to go after Obamacare at this point.
[00:36:00.995 --> 00:36:02.597]  The Republicans are like, why are you doing it?
[00:36:03.017 --> 00:36:05.819]  Because it was on the list.
[00:36:06.399 --> 00:36:07.720]  It's the next thing on his list.
[00:36:11.904 --> 00:36:16.227]  And I watch these hit pieces and it's just, it's bizarre how Trump and I are like bound.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.600]  They even say that.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.101]  They say, we're going to get Trump, we're going to get Jones.
[00:36:23.261 --> 00:36:41.365]  And they've basically stolen my identity and created this arch villain that they then are trying to use the captured identity of Alex Jones, this false identity, to project onto everyone else that they want to then demonize and attack.
[00:36:41.445 --> 00:36:46.165]  So I'm being turned into Darth Vader, is the best analogy.
[00:36:46.666 --> 00:36:48.486]  And of course, Trump is Emperor Palpatine.
[00:36:50.179 --> 00:36:51.740]  But that is not what's happening here.
[00:36:53.062 --> 00:37:01.549]  And then they take the fact that I'm real, and I really tell you what I feel, and I really tell you what I stand for, to make that a weakness.
[00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:02.710]  Here's an example.
[00:37:05.993 --> 00:37:11.878]  You know, with Mr. Frank and others, I've got incredible news here to cover.
[00:37:12.419 --> 00:37:13.560]  I've got big guests coming up.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:22.082]  But I was in over, I get the Google alerts, over 500 original news articles that I got alerted to.
[00:37:22.362 --> 00:37:24.843]  Most of them got syndicated in the newspapers and on the television.
[00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:31.064]  I mean, no one I know can turn a TV on or go to a restaurant when I'm not on the television most of the time.
[00:37:32.165 --> 00:37:36.726]  My kids, everywhere they go, they see me.
[00:37:39.067 --> 00:37:39.547]  It's insane.
[00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:45.564]  So, what is the endgame?
[00:37:45.684 --> 00:37:46.625]  Why are they doing this?
[00:37:46.645 --> 00:37:53.892]  They silence me as much as they can so that I can't speak for myself, and then they create this villain that I'm supposedly in.
[00:37:54.452 --> 00:37:58.617]  They don't put out this level of propaganda on something unless they're planning something big.
[00:37:59.898 --> 00:38:03.762]  Remember when they started burning a few Hollywood people with the Me Too movement?
[00:38:05.543 --> 00:38:08.147]  That was because the Democrats knew they had no credibility because of the Clintons.
[00:38:08.628 --> 00:38:12.874]  They thought they would distract by persecuting a few leftists and making them resign.
[00:38:14.537 --> 00:38:15.458]  And most of them deserved it.
[00:38:15.478 --> 00:38:18.443]  But it was still a persecution because it was planned and directed.
[00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:26.473]  Like the stupid former senator from Minnesota.
[00:38:27.033 --> 00:38:30.235]  Because he did a funny photo grabbing a woman's breast and done some jerky stuff.
[00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:36.318]  And he probably should resign, but the point is, according to a Democratic yardstick, he should go to jail, basically.
[00:38:37.418 --> 00:38:49.945]  So they had a few of them fall on their sword to set the precedent to then remove any Republican in the future that even got accused.
[00:38:51.869 --> 00:38:53.890]  And they go, hey, we all resigned, but Kavanaugh didn't.
[00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.350]  Because Kavanaugh didn't do anything.
[00:38:56.991 --> 00:38:57.671]  It was a fraud.
[00:38:58.231 --> 00:39:00.552]  Most women came forward and said they did it for political reasons.
[00:39:01.352 --> 00:39:02.332]  They were proud of themselves.
[00:39:02.352 --> 00:39:03.373]  They said, he's bad.
[00:39:03.393 --> 00:39:10.155]  It's like a lot of folks are defending Smollett, saying, well, you know, they're a bunch of white racists, so we gotta stage this to show you how bad it is.
[00:39:11.936 --> 00:39:13.556]  That's why they dropped charges against him.
[00:39:13.856 --> 00:39:15.877]  Because the prosecutor thinks he's a hero.
[00:39:19.377 --> 00:39:26.099]  And we're just supposed to forget about the Kavanaugh kids, and Balazi Ford, and Smollett, and the fake Russiagate, and all this crap.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.540]  And so they need some win.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.682]  The Democrats need somebody that's fake, somebody that's bad, somebody that's like them.
[00:39:33.702 --> 00:39:39.524]  And so what they do is, like a sin-eater, they project
[00:39:41.834 --> 00:39:49.657]  All of their sins and all of their tactics and the way they behave and the way they connive and the way they lie on to yours truly.
[00:39:51.698 --> 00:39:53.039]  And it's the only thing they can do.
[00:39:53.979 --> 00:39:56.100]  And they do the same thing on Trump, but it's not working.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.640]  So they say...
[00:39:58.993 --> 00:40:01.415]  Jones has helped relaunch the Americana with his audience.
[00:40:02.236 --> 00:40:03.797]  A powerful audience that is the heart of this.
[00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:07.900]  Let's take our main enemy that helped get Trump in and then let's turn it against Trump.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.563]  And let's make Trump in the 2020 election.
[00:40:12.363 --> 00:40:15.025]  That's why they send him all these letters and say denounce Alex Jones.
[00:40:15.065 --> 00:40:17.127]  All these Sandy Hook lawyers and all of them.
[00:40:17.908 --> 00:40:23.032]  They create the false trauma and then they want me when Trump denounces me
[00:40:24.144 --> 00:40:28.947]  They want me to denounce Trump, and they want my audience to denounce Trump.
[00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:31.249]  Well, Trump isn't going to denounce me.
[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:38.454]  But I tell my audience, if he and some Machiavellian in his wisdom wants to denounce me, denounce away, President.
[00:40:39.255 --> 00:40:39.695]  I'm ready.
[00:40:40.496 --> 00:40:47.701]  I'm playing the part, aren't I, in the real world, because the whole world's a stage of the Dark Knight.
[00:40:49.574 --> 00:40:53.575]  And so if I've got to get the blame for things to save this country, that's fine.
[00:40:53.955 --> 00:40:54.775]  Destroy me.
[00:40:56.035 --> 00:41:01.296]  By the way, I've already told the president that, and the president is not going to go with it, which I don't think he needs to.
[00:41:01.376 --> 00:41:02.017]  I think he's smart.
[00:41:02.417 --> 00:41:05.397]  I've just said I don't blame whoever, whatever happens to happen to me, I'm ready.
[00:41:07.318 --> 00:41:13.319]  I volunteered for this mission, and I'm fully committed to whatever has to happen, and I'm not going to question or doubt anything.
[00:41:14.286 --> 00:41:24.494]  As long as the President's steadfast in saving the country and the border and the Second Amendment and unborn and already born babies, as long as he keeps carrying out his mission, I'm going to carry out my mission and I'm not going to back down.
[00:41:24.554 --> 00:41:28.937]  Because if they think they're going to get me to turn against the President or turn against this country, it's never going to happen.
[00:41:29.177 --> 00:41:32.440]  Now, I've said tongue-in-cheek things like, I love the President, I hate the President.
[00:41:34.081 --> 00:41:38.804]  I don't like being demonized for my support of the President at a visceral, you know, fleshly level.
[00:41:38.824 --> 00:41:39.465]  This is not fun.
[00:41:39.485 --> 00:41:41.887]  But I love the President at a spiritual level.
[00:41:43.444 --> 00:41:51.387]  In the flesh, if he just wants to have a good time and be left alone, because I'm really a reclusive person in reality, I don't like President Trump.
[00:41:52.707 --> 00:41:57.409]  Because in the straw man they've built of him, I get demonized by Trump's doppelganger.
[00:41:57.849 --> 00:41:59.309]  But again, that's not the real Trump.
[00:41:59.609 --> 00:42:02.450]  And the Alex Jones you see out there is not the real Alex Jones.
[00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.611]  When we come back, I'll play a few of the viral clips.
[00:42:05.979 --> 00:42:11.283]  Some I haven't played yet, a three plus hour deposition that the media misrepresented.
[00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:13.064]  You'll notice most of the headlines use Jones.
[00:42:13.304 --> 00:42:16.086]  It says he has psychosis and is crazy.
[00:42:17.447 --> 00:42:18.508]  They don't actually show what I said.
[00:42:18.848 --> 00:42:20.589]  That's not what I said.
[00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:28.454]  And when you hear the video or see the video, hear the audio, when I play this on radio and TV and we come back, you'll go, I've heard Alex say that 50 times.
[00:42:29.415 --> 00:42:29.875]  Exactly.
[00:42:30.896 --> 00:42:31.917]  I was being real with you.
[00:42:32.955 --> 00:42:39.619]  I was really trying to get everybody out there to really be retrospective and look for the truth of what's going on, not one extreme or the other.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.942]  And I'll explain that when we come back, what I mean by extreme.
[00:42:44.483 --> 00:42:46.124]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:42:46.184 --> 00:42:48.865]  It's good to be extremely pro-family, pro-God, pro-self-defense.
[00:42:48.885 --> 00:42:54.089]  What I mean extreme is, extremely believing everything you're told, or extremely not believing everything you're told.
[00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:55.770]  How do you find that balance?
[00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.992]  How do you trust but verify, as old Ronald Reagan said?
[00:42:59.292 --> 00:42:59.733]  Stay with us.
[00:43:09.014 --> 00:43:13.821]  I planned every segment today to wear a different t-shirt, and I just get too focused on the news and don't do it.
[00:43:14.522 --> 00:43:15.804]  But if you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:17.967]  It's Don't California My USA.
[00:43:19.489 --> 00:43:21.191]  And it's got Infowars.com on the right.
[00:43:22.356 --> 00:43:22.897]  I think?
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.200]  They're quite nice.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.521]  I know my wife likes to wear them around.
[00:43:45.701 --> 00:43:47.062]  And it's kind of choose your own adventure.
[00:43:47.082 --> 00:43:48.303]  And I've tried to explain this before.
[00:43:48.443 --> 00:43:51.545]  You wear a big, in-your-face, red InfoWars shirt.
[00:43:51.625 --> 00:43:53.467]  That's about as obnoxious as you're going to get.
[00:43:53.487 --> 00:43:55.668]  And you're going to meet a lot of friends and a lot of cool people.
[00:43:55.688 --> 00:43:58.650]  It's got a bunch of reviews, five stars, 100% review.
[00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.352]  American flag, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com on the front.
[00:44:01.452 --> 00:44:02.613]  That shirt is the best seller.
[00:44:02.693 --> 00:44:06.135]  And that's for people that really want to, you know, go out and exercise the First Amendment.
[00:44:06.255 --> 00:44:11.258]  But if you wear just an IW hat, only patriots know what that is.
[00:44:12.259 --> 00:44:14.202]  And then you're just getting the love, not the hate.
[00:44:14.302 --> 00:44:18.428]  Or if you wear a Molon Labe, you don't think leftists can speak Latin or know that means come and take it.
[00:44:18.548 --> 00:44:18.708]  No.
[00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:22.133]  All they do is talk about how smart they are and listen to NPR and little snake voices all day.
[00:44:22.153 --> 00:44:23.595]  We've got over 100 t-shirts.
[00:44:23.896 --> 00:44:25.338]  Some are steadfast.
[00:44:25.518 --> 00:44:26.780]  One design I made 20 years ago.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.421]  22 years ago now.
[00:44:28.502 --> 00:44:30.063]  Mass murderers agree gun control works.
[00:44:30.243 --> 00:44:33.165]  I sat there on Photoshop and put Hitler, Stalin, and Mao by each other.
[00:44:33.225 --> 00:44:37.047]  On the back it said, politicians love disarmed peasants, which I got from a bumper sticker.
[00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:40.649]  Then we've got all these great designer shirts with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on them.
[00:44:40.749 --> 00:44:42.390]  So we've got high-end shirts that are great.
[00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:43.751]  It'll be 50 bucks at the mall.
[00:44:43.991 --> 00:44:44.792]  They're 25 bucks here.
[00:44:44.852 --> 00:44:46.233]  We've got other shirts that are as low as $9.95.
[00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:47.954]  It's all there.
[00:44:48.114 --> 00:44:48.655]  Trump 2020.
[00:44:48.755 --> 00:44:50.076]  Won't tread on me.
[00:44:50.276 --> 00:44:51.377]  Re-elect 45.
[00:44:51.538 --> 00:44:52.479]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:44:52.699 --> 00:44:53.820]  Hey, show them the George Washington.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.822]  That's really good, soft, high-quality fabric.
[00:44:55.862 --> 00:44:58.345]  That's one of my favorite shirts I wear, is the George Washington.
[00:44:58.505 --> 00:45:05.412]  And it's him from his, before the French-Indian War, when he was a colonial scout, expanding the frontiers as a scientist.
[00:45:05.532 --> 00:45:07.454]  And as an engineer, he was out there serving.
[00:45:07.594 --> 00:45:11.175]  And so that's kind of the George Washington without the tomahawk and a musket in his hand.
[00:45:11.315 --> 00:45:12.096]  A great shirt.
[00:45:12.236 --> 00:45:14.336]  And like I said, the fabric's so good and it's so high quality.
[00:45:14.356 --> 00:45:15.897]  I think the shirt cost like seven, eight bucks.
[00:45:16.097 --> 00:45:18.118]  So for $19.95, it is a great deal.
[00:45:18.138 --> 00:45:22.219]  The point is, you don't buy the products, we don't spread the word, we lose.
[00:45:22.859 --> 00:45:23.880]  You get them, we win.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.840]  But I mean, it's an adventure.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.561]  Don't California my USA.
[00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:30.279]  Who wouldn't want to wear a shirt like that?
[00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:33.120]  Or Alexandria Cortez as the dog?
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:39.021]  You know, she said, we'll have you subpoenaed or arrested, Donald Trump Jr., because you said, socialists eat their dogs, capitalists walk them.
[00:45:39.121 --> 00:45:40.962]  So I said, okay, well, we'll just put that shirt on.
[00:45:41.062 --> 00:45:42.782]  And I predict it to be a bestseller.
[00:45:42.842 --> 00:45:43.442]  It is.
[00:45:43.502 --> 00:45:44.302]  I've done two runs.
[00:45:44.322 --> 00:45:45.303]  This is the last run.
[00:45:45.403 --> 00:45:47.623]  We're about the new variant of the Cortez shirt.
[00:45:47.723 --> 00:45:51.324]  But this limited edition is about to go the way of the Goonie Bird, which means extinct.
[00:45:51.524 --> 00:45:53.364]  So if you want it, InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:47:07.054 --> 00:47:09.645]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:42.537 --> 00:47:43.898]  The globalists are panicking.
[00:47:43.918 --> 00:47:45.939]  Humanity is awake to their technocracy.
[00:47:47.519 --> 00:47:55.623]  But I've now really discovered and researched exactly why I'm being attacked and demonized, second only to President Trump.
[00:47:56.623 --> 00:48:04.367]  They have ratcheted up their demonization ahead of 2020 to make me a symbol of evil and fraud and lies and fake news.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.503]  To be a icon so they can support censorship.
[00:48:09.083 --> 00:48:13.527]  And so they can hype their supporters up into a 10 minutes of hate directly from 1984.
[00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:22.276]  And so they can then destroy me and have a fake victory before 2020.
[00:48:23.397 --> 00:48:24.758]  Because they've been unable to take out Trump.
[00:48:26.219 --> 00:48:27.321]  That's why all this is being done.
[00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:29.803]  First I was to be used to hurt Trump in the election, it backfired.
[00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:40.389]  Then our Americana got supercharged because of their attacks and entered the bloodstream of national politics even stronger.
[00:48:43.672 --> 00:48:51.495]  And now they have turned us into the thousand-foot Godzilla that they projected onto us before.
[00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:54.496]  Yes, we helped stoke the flames of populism and nationalism.
[00:48:54.536 --> 00:49:02.540]  Yes, our audience was, of all the great organizations and groups, up front with Drudge and only a few others in taking the country back.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.841]  We deserve to be targeted.
[00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:07.542]  We earned this.
[00:49:08.302 --> 00:49:10.183]  This is a sign of our victory, what we asked for.
[00:49:10.803 --> 00:49:12.103]  People always say, take the country back.
[00:49:12.123 --> 00:49:13.024]  Well, do you know what that's going to take?
[00:49:14.096 --> 00:49:14.576]  Sacrifice.
[00:49:15.137 --> 00:49:15.757]  I'm very honored.
[00:49:17.038 --> 00:49:21.502]  But now it's gone into 10 times previous attacks.
[00:49:22.783 --> 00:49:24.264]  It's foaming at the mouth.
[00:49:24.684 --> 00:49:28.847]  Almost every talk station, rock and roll stations will break in and say mean things about me.
[00:49:29.227 --> 00:49:31.709]  I'll be listening to XM and they'll just say something horrible about me.
[00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:34.972]  You tune into Howard Stern, he's saying something horrible.
[00:49:35.312 --> 00:49:37.533]  I mean, it's just the orders have gone out.
[00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:40.676]  This man is the devil and he is to be destroyed.
[00:49:43.223 --> 00:49:46.404]  And if you understand why they're doing it, you understand the key to their larger game plan.
[00:49:51.386 --> 00:49:53.387]  They are making their move.
[00:49:54.867 --> 00:50:02.370]  And then once they've trained their followers to hate me, and once they've radicalized the left even more, they will then turn them loose on everybody else.
[00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:04.530]  That's all.
[00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:08.932]  I'm like a training toy to give them the taste of blood.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:16.122]  And to get them to attack, and to get them into a rage, and then once they've attacked me, and once they've all gone along with lying about me, then it's everybody else.
[00:50:16.642 --> 00:50:18.062]  And here's a few examples.
[00:50:19.222 --> 00:50:21.643]  I've always talked about how this is very important.
[00:50:22.623 --> 00:50:27.405]  On one end of the spectrum, you've got people with mass Stockholm Syndrome who will believe anything corporate media tells them.
[00:50:28.405 --> 00:50:29.465]  We've got all the examples of that.
[00:50:30.205 --> 00:50:31.886]  There's still folks that think Russiagate's real.
[00:50:32.915 --> 00:50:33.855]  Two-thirds of Democrats do.
[00:50:34.355 --> 00:50:38.257]  And on the other end, you've got people that think this is all a simulation and nothing's real.
[00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:49.700]  In fact, most big computer heads are like that because they're living inside simulation already in a false reality of zeros and ones, a mathematical construction, and so they start projecting it onto the world around them.
[00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.681]  When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:57.763]  So you've got folks who believe everything they're told and don't question the universe or anything.
[00:50:57.783 --> 00:51:00.644]  And then you've got people on the other end who think the Earth is flat.
[00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.352]  And who think that maybe this is a simulation and nothing's real.
[00:51:04.912 --> 00:51:06.313]  And they have their right to do that.
[00:51:06.933 --> 00:51:17.299]  But you're going to get more people on the other end of the spectrum not believing anything, science, anything, because they've been lied to so much.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:22.022]  You know, children that get abused by their parents, that get lied to, those are the people that get psychosis.
[00:51:22.823 --> 00:51:26.025]  Really strong psychosis, where they don't know what reality is and what it isn't.
[00:51:28.306 --> 00:51:31.048]  And so there's an artificial insanity for everyone.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.543]  It's like having your windshield fogged up.
[00:51:36.528 --> 00:51:42.738]  You normally don't have it fogged up, but when there's all these lies, all this propaganda, all the WMDs and...
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:49.222]  Babies in incubators and nerve gas attacks that turned out to be ISIS and they said it was Assad.
[00:51:49.702 --> 00:51:53.863]  You start to not know what's real and what isn't because you get lied to so much.
[00:51:54.363 --> 00:52:00.765]  And so it's an artificial, synthetic fog, fog of war that becomes a psychosis.
[00:52:00.945 --> 00:52:06.327]  Because a psychosis is not being able to differentiate reality mentally.
[00:52:08.187 --> 00:52:09.788]  And so I said it was almost a form.
[00:52:12.492 --> 00:52:13.752]  A form of psychosis.
[00:52:13.772 --> 00:52:15.433]  This is my own lay psychology.
[00:52:15.453 --> 00:52:16.273]  I don't have a degree in this.
[00:52:16.313 --> 00:52:17.613]  I'm just a student of the world.
[00:52:18.674 --> 00:52:20.394]  An old school hand of the world.
[00:52:22.795 --> 00:52:25.736]  And he let me drive his truck when he was too drunk to.
[00:52:27.016 --> 00:52:30.037]  And he'd wink and give me money for the girls.
[00:52:30.877 --> 00:52:33.278]  And our lives were like some old western movie.
[00:52:33.318 --> 00:52:36.519]  Sorry, I'm singing a line from The Highwaymen.
[00:52:37.379 --> 00:52:38.439]  What's the name of that song?
[00:52:38.479 --> 00:52:39.800]  Desperado's Waiting for a Train.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.540]  We ought to play that today.
[00:52:45.327 --> 00:52:45.948]  I'm digressing.
[00:52:47.049 --> 00:52:48.490]  So, that's how they operate.
[00:52:50.071 --> 00:52:50.952]  And then they take that.
[00:52:51.132 --> 00:52:52.954]  Jones says he has a psychosis.
[00:52:53.594 --> 00:52:55.456]  Jones says he was crazy when he did this.
[00:52:55.496 --> 00:53:00.580]  No, I was saying, when they lie to you so much about everything else, it's perfectly normal not to believe anything anymore.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:07.706]  But then, when people started thinking that I was Bill Hicks, or Beau Bridges, or Jeff Bridges, and really believe it, what's the frequency, Dan?
[00:53:08.347 --> 00:53:09.307]  Dan, what's the frequency?
[00:53:09.548 --> 00:53:10.869]  Stuff like that happens to you enough.
[00:53:12.915 --> 00:53:20.877]  You start seeing how the system lying so much, and all the confusion, and all the poison, and electromagnetic, and just everything out there.
[00:53:20.917 --> 00:53:21.997]  Mental illness is way up!
[00:53:23.218 --> 00:53:26.278]  Because people don't know what to differentiate anymore, and they crack up!
[00:53:26.598 --> 00:53:36.241]  Kind of like an astronaut, who's super tough and super smart, but 50 days inside a capsule, with weird buzzers going off and stuff, they start going crazy!
[00:53:37.199 --> 00:53:40.763]  Temporary slide into a type of psychosis.
[00:53:41.344 --> 00:53:43.486]  That's a really smart statement, it's true.
[00:53:45.629 --> 00:53:55.360]  In that everything starts looking like a nail because they've lied so much, and then you look at those things, and even though you can't prove it one way or another, there's some anomalies, you go and you say, yeah, it probably is.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.261]  I'm proud!
[00:53:57.423 --> 00:53:59.824]  Of the fact that I've always been honest and always questioned and had courage.
[00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:05.647]  But they make that see something evil and then say Jones admits he has a psychosis, which is not what I said.
[00:54:05.887 --> 00:54:07.547]  I said almost a form.
[00:54:08.128 --> 00:54:08.888]  And I described it.
[00:54:09.688 --> 00:54:15.871]  But see, most of these places they tell you Jones admits he's crazy, they even edit out the almost.
[00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:20.113]  Or they fade the audio down right before so they can put their fraud out and lie to you.
[00:54:20.293 --> 00:54:20.633]  Here it is.
[00:54:23.609 --> 00:54:28.030]  There's a question that I should have asked you today in deposition that I didn't.
[00:54:32.451 --> 00:54:33.531]  That's a good question.
[00:54:33.991 --> 00:54:46.894]  A question you should ask me.
[00:54:46.954 --> 00:54:47.754]  I can't think of anything.
[00:54:48.634 --> 00:54:49.334]  Okay, Mr. Jones.
[00:54:50.535 --> 00:54:51.975]  You would agree with me that
[00:54:53.561 --> 00:55:08.968]  When some damage happens, when you break something, when you cause something to be lost, when you hurt somebody, whether it's intentional or whether it's a mistake, there's consequences for that, right?
[00:55:09.949 --> 00:55:11.930]  People should be accountable for the people they hurt.
[00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.011]  Objection is deformed.
[00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:20.354]  Well, sometimes people claim they've been hurt and they haven't been.
[00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:22.632]  I think?
[00:55:44.062 --> 00:55:45.924]  Any compass of what's real.
[00:55:47.005 --> 00:55:55.592]  And I myself have almost had a form of psychosis back in the past where I basically thought everything was staged, even though I've now learned a lot of times things aren't staged.
[00:55:56.172 --> 00:56:04.919]  So I think as a pundit and someone giving opinion that my opinions have been wrong, but they were never wrong consciously to hurt people.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:13.984]  And so I think it's part of that process of me growing up in Rockwall, Texas, watching the police steal drugs and then conduct anti-drug programs at the school.
[00:56:14.064 --> 00:56:16.706]  I think that shook my opinion of police in general.
[00:56:17.526 --> 00:56:21.588]  And I was very anti-law enforcement until I grew up and learned more things and now I'm pretty much pro-police.
[00:56:22.249 --> 00:56:24.310]  So it's been a process.
[00:56:25.993 --> 00:56:27.213]  And life is a process.
[00:56:27.814 --> 00:56:31.075]  Oh, Alex, you questioned Sandy Hook when everybody else was questioning it.
[00:56:31.815 --> 00:56:34.736]  I've had all these liberals at the Beto rally going, hey, I questioned Sandy Hook.
[00:56:34.796 --> 00:56:37.657]  I mean, most people don't buy it, for whatever reason.
[00:56:39.418 --> 00:56:46.060]  And then once you say, OK, I apologize if any of this hurt you, they go, oh, we got you.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.360]  Keep apologizing.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:52.382]  And then they turn you into this devil when the New York Times isn't apologizing for lying about WMDs consciously.
[00:56:54.508 --> 00:56:57.290]  CNN doesn't apologize for any of their lies about Russiagate.
[00:56:58.091 --> 00:56:58.631]  None of them did.
[00:56:58.691 --> 00:56:59.752]  They did it on purpose.
[00:56:59.832 --> 00:57:01.513]  They get a memo, they put lies out.
[00:57:01.813 --> 00:57:05.897]  But oh, the left is all sanctimonious, like that lawyer who's a big leftist, sitting there.
[00:57:07.698 --> 00:57:09.159]  Aren't you sorry for what you've done?
[00:57:09.219 --> 00:57:10.640]  No, I'm not sorry for what I've done.
[00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:17.665]  I'm sorry if me having to ask these questions hurt people's feelings, and I'm sorry for tragedies, but I didn't kill those children.
[00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.928]  But we've had this senator, Murphy,
[00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:29.061]  Murray, whatever the hell his name is, up there in Connecticut, come out and say that I killed this guy that died last week.
[00:57:29.342 --> 00:57:30.502]  He said I killed him!
[00:57:32.643 --> 00:57:34.224]  The Sandy Hook father, that's outrageous!
[00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:37.806]  He gets to have his platform and say that, but not me!
[00:57:38.586 --> 00:57:40.527]  He just said I killed that man!
[00:57:41.628 --> 00:57:43.689]  That's okay because he's an anointed leftist.
[00:57:43.709 --> 00:57:48.612]  He said the survival of our democracy depends on banning InfoWars.
[00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.713]  The whole system's declared war on me.
[00:57:50.813 --> 00:57:51.073]  Why?
[00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:53.490]  It's incredible.
[00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:56.792]  We're fighting back and we're winning thanks to you.
[00:57:56.812 --> 00:58:00.934]  I've got some good news for you folks, but some bad news for the globalists.
[00:58:03.435 --> 00:58:06.576]  I've got good news for the people of America and the people of the world.
[00:58:07.376 --> 00:58:12.619]  Trump has been totally exonerated from the entire Russia-gate attempted coup d'etat takedown.
[00:58:13.379 --> 00:58:17.381]  And now he's going on the offense with the big executive order of a week ago
[00:58:18.718 --> 00:58:21.320]  Trump said the meeting went well.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:25.163]  And the word is, Apple and Facebook and Twitter, they're all being
[00:58:43.422 --> 00:58:49.127]  Talked to by the President over the telephone, and private meetings are being set up where he's going to lay down the law.
[00:58:49.227 --> 00:59:00.237]  That they're not going to side with authoritarian foreign powers, that they're going to either abide by the Constitution and Bill of Rights and not be authoritarians, or he's going to take action against them.
[00:59:00.277 --> 00:59:02.279]  That is everything we've needed to hear.
[00:59:02.719 --> 00:59:04.481]  Now let's make sure the President follows through.
[00:59:04.981 --> 00:59:06.383]  Now, InfoWars, as you know,
[00:59:06.983 --> 00:59:07.603]  We're good to go.
[00:59:28.194 --> 00:59:28.815]  We're good to go.
[00:59:56.926 --> 01:00:01.189]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:09.996]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.114 --> 01:00:13.094]  Always informative.
[01:00:13.134 --> 01:00:13.955]  Very smart guy.
[01:00:14.095 --> 01:00:14.775]  I'll use his name.
[01:00:14.795 --> 01:00:25.117]  We're talking about Alex Jones and the fact of the matter is, is that the companies that allow people like him, conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility.
[01:00:25.938 --> 01:00:35.320]  There is no constitutional duty on an internet company to allow somebody to terrorize parents of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:41.148]  The Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him accountable.
[01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:47.216]  But the companies that allow for this nonsense, this garbage, to be spread out over the internet...
[01:00:48.596 --> 01:00:54.780]  ...have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the case of Andy Hook.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.443]  So, Sandy Hook hasn't been successful in getting the guns.
[01:01:00.183 --> 01:01:01.124]  CNN's complaining.
[01:01:01.144 --> 01:01:04.866]  They're going, man, they took the guns in New Zealand in just a week.
[01:01:05.506 --> 01:01:06.507]  We can't get the guns here.
[01:01:06.607 --> 01:01:08.668]  So it failed to get the Second Amendment.
[01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:12.711]  So they've got to get our First Amendment, and that's what
[01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:20.241]  That Senator's doing, who by the way was heavily involved in his career sucking off of Sandy Hook to get elected, I've now learned.
[01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:24.403]  You've got Senator Blumenthal's son that works in a law firm that's suing me there.
[01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:26.684]  I mean this is a Democrat franchise.
[01:01:27.285 --> 01:01:29.206]  They're the ones that live off the deaths of these kids.
[01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:35.630]  They're the ones that obsess over it and in my name say things I never said and then beat their chest and call for an end to the First Amendment.
[01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:37.771]  What a group of monsters.
[01:01:38.797 --> 01:01:46.119]  Now the always informative and really smart Bob Barnes, who's fighting all this with us, Chief Legal Counsel, will be joining us the rest of the hour.
[01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:47.900]  We'll cover a waterfront of news.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.061]  And then Ben Garrison, who's also being demonized and taken off the internet, he'll be joining us.
[01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:56.382]  We'll have open phones as well and a lot of other world news I haven't hit.
[01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:57.922]  We'll cover it at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:58.443 --> 01:01:59.543]  But getting back to the deposition.
[01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:10.587]  This is where the Texas lawyer who is just a puppet, I mean he's completely run by the Connecticut law firm and Senator Blumenthal's operation and Chris Murphy's operation.
[01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:15.348]  Where he, they just go through buzzwords for the media.
[01:02:15.628 --> 01:02:18.149]  I mean all this was was soundbite questions for the media.
[01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:23.950]  And they ask about a big bowl of chili and I'm supposed to answer about a big bowl of chili so then they can make me sound stupid.
[01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:28.951]  And this is the type of just weirdness where these people think getting in the news is cool.
[01:02:30.055 --> 01:02:33.277]  And I mean, it does something in this whole bandwagon.
[01:02:33.577 --> 01:02:34.277]  So here it is.
[01:02:36.598 --> 01:02:38.519]  That's, from my memory, not what happens.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.060]  I can't comment on hypotheticals.
[01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:46.884]  Oh, so if I was to say to you, if somebody was to come along and strike your hand with a hammer, would it hurt?
[01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.525]  You can't answer that question.
[01:02:49.865 --> 01:02:51.186]  I'm not striking anybody with a hammer, sir.
[01:02:51.566 --> 01:02:55.268]  If I asked you, if I gave you a big bowl of chili, might it affect your memory?
[01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:56.489]  You can't answer that.
[01:02:56.529 --> 01:02:57.169]  That's hypothetical.
[01:02:59.110 --> 01:02:59.391]  Correct?
[01:03:00.274 --> 01:03:02.040]  You're just not going to answer those kind of questions.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.661]  I'll take it that's a no.
[01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:10.662]  Let's move on.
[01:03:10.702 --> 01:03:12.303]  I'll take it that wasn't a question.
[01:03:12.363 --> 01:03:13.124]  Is that a question?
[01:03:13.544 --> 01:03:15.026]  That's a comment, that's not a question.
[01:03:15.046 --> 01:03:16.707]  This is becoming one of the most harassing of yet.
[01:03:16.887 --> 01:03:19.950]  This is for TV and for PR, not for a legitimate suit.
[01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.951]  That's what this is.
[01:03:21.191 --> 01:03:21.812]  That's all this is.
[01:03:21.872 --> 01:03:23.533]  You want to put it on TV.
[01:03:23.553 --> 01:03:26.336]  This is just a show and it's a bad show at that.
[01:03:26.396 --> 01:03:30.039]  It's a show on how not to be a lawyer in deposition of a case show.
[01:03:30.419 --> 01:03:33.381]  I mean, if you want to be fair, and you want to ask real questions, go ahead.
[01:03:33.401 --> 01:03:40.726]  But don't make comments, and then try to reinterpret those comments as a question, and then try to put words in the mouth of the witness.
[01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:43.227]  I mean, first-year law students should know that.
[01:03:45.449 --> 01:03:46.129]  What was your objection?
[01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:56.976]  The objection was to your comment saying that there was an answer, and my point was, you didn't ask a question, so there couldn't have been an answer, and I was objecting for the record purposes that no answer had been given to a question that had not been asked.
[01:03:58.493 --> 01:04:00.815]  Do you maybe want to take a break so we can have a few breaths?
[01:04:01.055 --> 01:04:01.756]  Yes, maybe.
[01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.077]  Yeah, you might need to do that.
[01:04:03.318 --> 01:04:04.179]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:06.281]  Maybe you can go back and read how to ask people.
[01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:06.601]  Okay.
[01:04:07.502 --> 01:04:14.068]  Then there's this clip at the end where they weren't even supposed to discuss releasing it for 30 days, but it was released in just about two and a half weeks.
[01:04:14.108 --> 01:04:14.649]  Here's that clip.
[01:04:15.632 --> 01:04:16.812]  Please go ahead and respond now.
[01:04:17.233 --> 01:04:29.678]  Um, so the, what we have in the protective order is that for the 30 days following any deposition, the parties must treat all of the deposition testimony and exhibits and other documents produced at any deposition as attorney's eyes only.
[01:04:30.258 --> 01:04:32.158]  And so they're marked confidential until that time.
[01:04:32.559 --> 01:04:33.439]  Thank you, Your Honor.
[01:04:34.219 --> 01:04:37.901]  So no designation of confidentiality being made today?
[01:04:38.121 --> 01:04:38.541]  Absolutely.
[01:04:38.561 --> 01:04:40.542]  The whole thing is confidential right now?
[01:04:40.622 --> 01:04:42.202]  It's presumed until 30 days.
[01:04:42.362 --> 01:04:44.783]  And we have 30 days to designate confidentiality?
[01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:45.324]  Absolutely.
[01:04:45.424 --> 01:04:45.744]  Very well.
[01:04:46.344 --> 01:04:46.644]  That's good.
[01:04:47.845 --> 01:04:50.826]  But, again, when you're Democrats, you can do whatever you want.
[01:04:51.686 --> 01:04:52.987]  Smollett, no charges.
[01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:54.327]  Charges dropped.
[01:04:55.067 --> 01:04:56.408]  Kavanaugh accusers, all fake.
[01:04:57.068 --> 01:04:57.648]  It's okay, though.
[01:04:57.969 --> 01:04:58.989]  Russiagate, all fake.
[01:04:59.669 --> 01:05:00.710]  Tubbington kids, all fake.
[01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:01.230]  It's okay.
[01:05:04.413 --> 01:05:05.414]  I mean, I've explained this.
[01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:17.445]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of social media last year, saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state, and just said I did it.
[01:05:18.767 --> 01:05:25.013]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[01:05:26.454 --> 01:05:43.022]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:05:44.645 --> 01:05:46.787]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:49.288]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:51.250]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.591]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[01:05:54.172 --> 01:05:56.394]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[01:05:57.855 --> 01:05:59.296]  All I have is you supporting us.
[01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:00.997]  That's all I have.
[01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:17.916]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:35.777]  Now that the Mueller investigation is over, many questions are falling upon Adam Schiff and others, who all claimed to have direct knowledge of criminal evidence against President Donald Trump.
[01:06:35.797 --> 01:06:39.959]  I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight.
[01:06:40.179 --> 01:06:41.700]  Cold, hard evidence.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:49.885]  Have you seen things on the classified side that you cannot tell us about, though, that is even stronger evidence than what is out there publicly?
[01:06:50.888 --> 01:06:51.108]  Yes.
[01:06:51.949 --> 01:07:03.022]  Some people are saying they are guilty of treason, but the statute for treason specifies that the person levies war against the United States or adheres to their enemies.
[01:07:03.783 --> 01:07:10.231]  And while we may discover that may be true for some, there is one statute that seems to apply to many.
[01:07:11.232 --> 01:07:18.155]  Enacted in 1940 as the Alien Registration Act, or the Smith Act, 18 U.S.
[01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:23.877]  Code 2385 prescribes advocating the overthrow of the U.S.
[01:07:23.937 --> 01:07:24.358]  government.
[01:07:25.158 --> 01:07:36.663]  The corrupt establishment was not willing to accept an outlier in the White House, and began their attempt at overthrowing the president with a FISA warrant based on a fake Russian dossier.
[01:07:37.903 --> 01:07:43.885]  With no evidence of a crime, the FBI was discussing plans for a coup d'etat.
[01:07:44.605 --> 01:07:52.947]  According to court documents, several mainstream media outlets were hired to report on Russian interference as directed.
[01:07:53.988 --> 01:08:02.050]  And the American people, who put their faith in the mainstream media, were manipulated and turned against their lawful elected government.
[01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.846]  It all certainly seems to fit 18 U.S.
[01:08:05.926 --> 01:08:07.588]  Code 2385.
[01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:24.006]  Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government of the United States.
[01:08:24.206 --> 01:08:25.307]  Government's gonna kill this guy.
[01:08:25.387 --> 01:08:53.107]  Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States.
[01:08:53.227 --> 01:08:53.948]  You take on the
[01:08:53.988 --> 01:09:22.847]  Intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society group or assembly of persons who teach Advocate or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence Or becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society group or assembly of persons knowing the purposes thereof
[01:09:24.208 --> 01:09:26.350]  Those found guilty of 18 U.S.
[01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:37.499]  Code 2385 can be imprisoned for up to 20 years, and perhaps further investigations will lead to charges of sedition or even treason.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.102]  The righteous heart wants justice to be served.
[01:09:41.903 --> 01:09:45.166]  For where there is no law, there is no freedom.
[01:09:46.907 --> 01:09:50.070]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:09:58.787 --> 01:10:05.533]  InfoWars.
[01:10:05.893 --> 01:10:07.555]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.463]  Until recently, no mainstream media
[01:10:18.058 --> 01:10:26.281]  Really got into strategies of the Democrat and Republican parties and who controlled them and what was really going on because both parties were pretty much run by the same groups.
[01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:29.602]  That's Georgetown political science head, Carol Quigley, wrote about it.
[01:10:30.623 --> 01:10:31.643]  It's really uncontested.
[01:10:32.524 --> 01:10:38.246]  That from the times of Kennedy on until recently, I mean, they really had a monolithic party.
[01:10:38.266 --> 01:10:41.327]  They'd fight over power, but they agreed on the agenda.
[01:10:43.086 --> 01:10:57.871]  Thanks to the internet and shows like this one and Drudge Report and others, but particularly this broadcast in this area, we were able to popularize understanding what was in the academic literature, which you'd call conspiracy literature.
[01:10:58.271 --> 01:11:05.574]  You hold up a Curl Quigley book or a Zbigniew Brzezinski book, they tell the intelligentsia everything they're doing, but they're in on the global government.
[01:11:05.974 --> 01:11:11.176]  So they're telling them how it works, but from their perspective, we're like, look, they admit this horrible plan, here's how they do it.
[01:11:12.503 --> 01:11:21.990]  So we popularized getting into the guts of this, and now all over the world people are looking at the power behind the throne, they're looking at collusion by parties, and once you do that it's game over.
[01:11:22.391 --> 01:11:30.216]  The system was so arrogant they defeated Barry Goldwater and they'd ignored Ron Paul and they thought they'd contained us, but in the last four or five years it exploded.
[01:11:30.817 --> 01:11:31.918]  Donald Trump perfectly.
[01:11:33.191 --> 01:11:37.052]  Man of Destiny rode in on that wave, and now the fight is joined.
[01:11:37.852 --> 01:11:41.573]  So, I want to get into the big report we did last night.
[01:11:41.733 --> 01:11:44.053]  It's been confirmed Trump is going to be willing to deep state.
[01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:45.353]  He is intending.
[01:11:45.413 --> 01:11:46.153]  He signaled it.
[01:11:46.293 --> 01:11:47.854]  My intel and sources, it's happening.
[01:11:48.514 --> 01:11:49.454]  We're going to get more into that.
[01:11:49.494 --> 01:11:57.775]  That video is on Infowars.com, and we'll show you that video where it's posted so folks that are watching and listening can go find it easily and share it.
[01:11:58.216 --> 01:12:00.296]  It's up in the video carousel up at the top.
[01:12:00.956 --> 01:12:08.121]  But I wanted to ask you, Bob, because you're a smart guy, why you think they've chosen me?
[01:12:09.081 --> 01:12:11.543]  Because now the attacks are 10 times what they've ever been.
[01:12:11.563 --> 01:12:13.024]  I mean, it is just insane.
[01:12:13.144 --> 01:12:20.048]  All over TV, local news, all over the country, total lies, twisting everything like I'm a country they're about to invade.
[01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:22.510]  And it's just ramping up, ramping up, ramping up.
[01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:25.152]  It's not just about them trying to win these fake lawsuits.
[01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:32.335]  I believe they have to destroy me to set the precedent to create a symbol of fake news that I'm supposedly the symbol of that demonized devil.
[01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:35.397]  And then with that key, they open every door and shut everyone else down.
[01:12:35.677 --> 01:12:37.698]  They create the 10 minutes of hate using my image.
[01:12:38.519 --> 01:12:43.601]  They steal the victory of our Americana populist movement, our listeners supercharging it, our victory.
[01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:46.283]  They turn a symbol of victory into a symbol of defeat.
[01:12:46.323 --> 01:12:49.184]  They kind of steal the flag and then run and hide it.
[01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:50.945]  A, is that true?
[01:12:50.965 --> 01:12:51.885]  And then what else is there?
[01:12:51.905 --> 01:12:52.626]  And then where does it go?
[01:12:53.126 --> 01:12:59.671]  Well, basically they're trying to effectively make it illegal to do anything other than spread institutional narratives.
[01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:11.439]  So if you spread any news that's not the institutional narrative, whether it's big media or the government, then you can be sued into oblivion, you can be blacklisted off of all of social media, and you can be demonized throughout the whole public square.
[01:13:11.959 --> 01:13:17.323]  And that's really the goal and the objective, and it's to use you as the telltale example to achieve that objective.
[01:13:17.843 --> 01:13:21.646]  And the effect of that is basically to destroy the independent free press in the United States.
[01:13:22.066 --> 01:13:30.032]  That if you spread any message, that message has to be institutionally approved, has to be state-sanctioned, has to be media approved, big media approved.
[01:13:30.312 --> 01:13:34.194]  And that's why there's double standards in how they're applying the law in a wide range of contexts here.
[01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:39.658]  That's why they're willing to defame you while claiming that there's defamation suits that they can bring against you.
[01:13:40.058 --> 01:13:42.340]  So you're seeing that systematic effort.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.761]  And let's explain that and quantify that.
[01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:45.461]  Everything's about symbols.
[01:14:11.252 --> 01:14:13.535]  So the globalists aren't targeting our regular listeners.
[01:14:13.555 --> 01:14:24.927]  They're targeting the public that doesn't know who we are yet, so that when they finally do see us, they self-judge and are, quote, inoculated against being converted or radicalized, as the establishment would call it.
[01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:31.554]  But there's something that is targeting our listeners to where they get so sick of us being demonized that they're scared to promote us.
[01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:37.698]  And also, stop defending so then they won't defend the next people that are brought down.
[01:14:37.998 --> 01:14:38.398]  Precisely.
[01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:41.681]  It's the same thing that basically Mueller and the Deep State tried to do against Trump.
[01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:56.252]  Try to get people to be afraid to defend him, afraid to back him up, afraid to support him, afraid to stand up for him, afraid to send him messages, afraid to... because his real political power, his real power was completely contingent dependent upon ordinary people giving him that power.
[01:14:56.553 --> 01:14:58.774]  They were the fuel by which he could do something.
[01:14:58.814 --> 01:15:00.736]  Their greatest fear is us communicating with the President.
[01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:01.376]  Precisely.
[01:15:01.656 --> 01:15:13.978]  And by doing so, they need to silence that, they need to control that, they need to coerce people through public shaming and public censorship campaigns to achieve an objective they cannot obtain if people have freedom of press and freedom of speech in the United States.
[01:15:14.638 --> 01:15:18.099]  When we come back, I want to ask you how we counter that, because you're one of the smartest people I know.
[01:15:18.119 --> 01:15:21.660]  And then we're going to shift gears into the video that I just showed earlier.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.680]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:29.121]  I'm going to have its own article posted on the front page so that people can share it, but it's right up there on the top of the carousel.
[01:15:29.761 --> 01:15:43.910]  Where you see the videos and again I'll just show you on my phones how people can find that but it's it's it's it's up on InfoWars.com so document cam shot please yeah there it is world exclusive
[01:15:46.468 --> 01:15:49.993]  Trump plans to prosecute hundreds of deep staters in 2019.
[01:15:50.113 --> 01:15:52.336]  It's got 43,000 views.
[01:15:52.376 --> 01:15:53.278]  It needs a million views.
[01:15:53.618 --> 01:15:55.641]  The Joe Rogan interview I did last week did get a million.
[01:15:55.981 --> 01:15:56.903]  Let's send it to a million.
[01:15:57.103 --> 01:15:57.844]  Only you can do it.
[01:15:57.924 --> 01:15:58.245]  Please.
[01:15:58.485 --> 01:16:00.488]  This is critical intel to bring down the globalist.
[01:16:08.857 --> 01:16:10.238]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[01:16:10.258 --> 01:16:11.758]  She wants to talk about the Virginia governor.
[01:16:12.258 --> 01:16:13.159]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[01:16:13.179 --> 01:16:14.980]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:15.400]  What do you think?
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:16.840]  I hope so.
[01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:19.301]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[01:16:19.522 --> 01:16:27.525]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him, and that was a big... I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[01:16:27.825 --> 01:16:29.986]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:33.468]  I can't really do his fake Southern accent, but it's just... I love Southerners.
[01:16:33.548 --> 01:16:34.949]  I'm from Texas, kind of Southern.
[01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:42.453]  But it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area, kill that baby.
[01:16:42.613 --> 01:16:46.996]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people, you know, kind of responding
[01:16:47.056 --> 01:16:53.179]  Yeah, I mean, I love listening to that voice he does, but it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[01:16:53.239 --> 01:16:56.241]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[01:16:56.421 --> 01:16:56.941]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:16:57.001 --> 01:16:57.981]  It's so sickening.
[01:16:58.062 --> 01:17:00.703]  Well, we know when in time, this is the stuff that happens.
[01:17:00.743 --> 01:17:05.765]  That's why I'm so proud of you and the InfoWorks team for all that you do.
[01:17:05.965 --> 01:17:08.287]  And I love I wanted to say I love your product.
[01:17:08.547 --> 01:17:11.708]  I have X2 and the selenium for my thyroid.
[01:17:11.808 --> 01:17:12.489]  And I have to say,
[01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:20.914]  I mean, you really can feel what it does.
[01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:26.139]  And usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue, and that helps tremendously.
[01:17:26.179 --> 01:17:33.425]  And the knockout helps me sleep at night, especially when I have something important I have to get up and do in the morning and I don't feel that groggy feeling.
[01:17:33.525 --> 01:17:34.746]  And we use the toothpaste.
[01:17:34.786 --> 01:17:35.967]  We love the toothpaste.
[01:17:36.067 --> 01:17:39.730]  My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with.
[01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:42.232]  My husband is a hardwood floor installer.
[01:17:42.632 --> 01:17:47.614]  He loves the body, and he loves the Redtail Plus, and we're going to try the Turbo Force next.
[01:17:48.154 --> 01:17:52.936]  I really want to get that Turbo Force because my son loves going to the gym and he needs something for a boost.
[01:17:53.016 --> 01:17:55.597]  Well, Jessie, I appreciate your support, but let me be honest with you.
[01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.018]  Only take a half pack at the first time.
[01:17:57.138 --> 01:17:59.019]  It's just, it's kind of like good crack.
[01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:01.280]  So, I'm almost embarrassed.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.880]  Everybody should be careful with it.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.521]  It's the next level, it's insane.
[01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:20.443]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty and I don't know what where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you on air who have just stayed strong through it all so I just want to encourage you just to keep
[01:18:20.523 --> 01:18:24.385]  Keep going, keep fighting for us and with us because I don't know.
[01:18:24.705 --> 01:18:25.705]  I don't know what we would do.
[01:18:25.745 --> 01:18:26.826]  We wouldn't have anybody.
[01:18:26.846 --> 01:18:30.927]  If there wasn't you, I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[01:18:31.027 --> 01:18:37.830]  Like you said, you're the tip of the spear, so I really appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth.
[01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:47.494]  It helps me to stay connected to God and I can't say enough about how much I love InfoWars, how much I love the products, but I would like to have some female cut shirts.
[01:18:48.615 --> 01:18:50.617]  No, no, I totally agree.
[01:18:51.458 --> 01:18:55.443]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt that was a big hit, and we're just brain dead.
[01:18:55.463 --> 01:18:57.926]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint, is from women.
[01:18:57.946 --> 01:18:59.868]  We've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females.
[01:18:59.928 --> 01:19:00.909]  We will get it done for you.
[01:19:00.929 --> 01:19:06.216]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on, and your husband, and your family, because just hearing what's in your voice, the
[01:19:06.496 --> 01:19:09.697]  The powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together.
[01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:13.599]  All of us focused together against the globalists is unstoppable.
[01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:18.480]  And that's why they're attacking that sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[01:19:18.761 --> 01:19:19.681]  We are humanity.
[01:19:20.001 --> 01:19:20.961]  We are the experience.
[01:19:20.981 --> 01:19:21.742]  We are everything.
[01:19:22.182 --> 01:19:23.982]  And so you've just got my commitment to fight on.
[01:19:24.002 --> 01:19:26.263]  But let me tell you, I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:26.864]  I'm burnt out.
[01:19:27.224 --> 01:19:27.904]  Hearing you.
[01:19:27.984 --> 01:19:29.164]  I don't want to just say this.
[01:19:29.284 --> 01:19:30.005]  I'm not just telling you this.
[01:19:30.505 --> 01:19:31.625]  You are the info war.
[01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:33.006]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[01:19:34.006 --> 01:19:37.850]  And that's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth.
[01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:39.051]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:42.754]  If you weren't here, standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[01:19:42.914 --> 01:19:44.095]  But we're in this together.
[01:19:44.255 --> 01:19:45.916]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[01:19:46.477 --> 01:19:49.319]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic gremlin governor.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.901]  Of course he's KKK.
[01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:53.163]  Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[01:19:53.203 --> 01:19:54.604]  That's what that's all really about.
[01:19:55.084 --> 01:19:56.265]  These are demons.
[01:19:56.786 --> 01:19:58.287]  But thanks to you and others, we're going to win.
[01:19:58.367 --> 01:19:59.008]  Thank you so much.
[01:20:06.405 --> 01:20:09.146]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:29.152]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.732 --> 01:20:33.593]  So we're breaking down the real agenda, the battle plan.
[01:20:34.665 --> 01:20:48.574]  And the globalists knew that the InfoWars audience... I mean, back on election week we had 87 million different IP addresses watch video or click on our live stream or on our YouTube or Facebook.
[01:20:48.715 --> 01:20:49.575]  That was conservative.
[01:20:50.776 --> 01:20:52.457]  Okay?
[01:20:52.757 --> 01:20:53.278]  87 million people.
[01:20:53.318 --> 01:20:54.619]  That's bigger than the Super Bowl tune-in.
[01:20:55.672 --> 01:20:57.554]  And they were just like, okay, drop the hammer.
[01:20:57.574 --> 01:20:59.436]  They were already censoring before, shadow banning.
[01:20:59.456 --> 01:21:01.918]  They just... But that wasn't working.
[01:21:01.938 --> 01:21:05.041]  So they publicly banned us and de-platformed everything.
[01:21:05.201 --> 01:21:05.862]  That didn't work.
[01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:10.626]  And again, they need to destroy us to have that victory over the First Amendment.
[01:21:10.646 --> 01:21:12.187]  So we've been chosen as the champion.
[01:21:12.227 --> 01:21:14.990]  Like in the old days, like El Cid's a true story.
[01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:15.611]  It's a great movie.
[01:21:15.651 --> 01:21:16.251]  Very accurate.
[01:21:16.852 --> 01:21:20.015]  They would have two champions instead of two kingdoms going to war in ancient Spain.
[01:21:21.485 --> 01:21:24.207]  Uh, they would, uh, pick two champions to kill each other.
[01:21:24.227 --> 01:21:32.973]  And then whoever won, uh, that battle, instead of having 5,000 soldiers die, you only lost, uh, you know, one soldier because they were fighting the Moors.
[01:21:33.613 --> 01:21:37.796]  And so we couldn't have, they used to have big wars, but all those kingdoms, Spain had like six or seven kingdoms.
[01:21:38.236 --> 01:21:39.457]  But after that, they couldn't have many more.
[01:21:39.897 --> 01:21:41.699]  And so they want to destroy me.
[01:21:42.119 --> 01:21:43.540]  I've been chosen as the champion.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.521]  I'm not saying I'm the champion.
[01:21:45.561 --> 01:21:46.882]  I'm not saying I'm perfect.
[01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:50.925]  They have chosen me as the symbol of Americana for destruction.
[01:21:51.685 --> 01:21:54.187]  And so now we talked about their plan, Bob, and what they're doing.
[01:21:54.507 --> 01:21:56.669]  Now we talk about how do we counter that.
[01:21:57.189 --> 01:22:07.858]  They were unable to destroy Trump, so now they've picked me to destroy as a morale booster, and to set the precedent to kill the First Amendment, and set the precedent to create the Alex Jones statute.
[01:22:08.338 --> 01:22:08.718]  Precisely.
[01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:17.385]  I mean, the goal and the objective is to demonize you to such a degree that they can demonize your message, and they can demonize your audience, and they can demonize anyone who ever wants to walk into your shoes.
[01:22:17.785 --> 01:22:20.187]  And so that's the continuous pattern that's taking place here.
[01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:27.472]  And it's a PR campaign that was launched in Hollywood with its caricature that it created in the Homeland Show.
[01:22:27.492 --> 01:22:29.613]  Then it's launched by the media and the press.
[01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:35.858]  Then they use the lawsuits for PR purposes rather than for legitimate lawsuit purposes as is already happening here.
[01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:37.059]  Then on top of that,
[01:22:38.075 --> 01:22:45.704]  The media uses what's happening in the lawsuits to try to create another false narrative and another fake story, to try to further demonize, to further marginalize.
[01:22:46.084 --> 01:22:47.646]  And it actually reflects an old objective.
[01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:56.156]  If you go back and study the cultural portrayal of poor whites or African Americans between 1900 and 1970, you'll see a similar demonization of entire groups of people.
[01:22:56.556 --> 01:22:56.996]  We're good to go.
[01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:18.871]  And because of that, they need to suppress it, they need to censor it, they need to shame it.
[01:23:19.231 --> 01:23:26.692]  And in order to achieve that, you're the one they've chosen to be the target to say, if you do what Alex Jones did, we'll treat you, we'll do what we did to Alex Jones.
[01:23:27.052 --> 01:23:28.333]  That's the goal, that's the objective.
[01:23:28.353 --> 01:23:29.733]  So that's it, it's the Alex Jones treatment?
[01:23:30.093 --> 01:23:30.513]  Absolutely.
[01:23:30.973 --> 01:23:36.014]  It's to say... It's like when they took William Wallace and Ron Corning and tortured him to death in front of everybody, it was a message.
[01:23:36.254 --> 01:23:41.916]  The most powerful form of censorship, as people like on the left, like Noam Chomsky and others have identified, is self-censorship.
[01:23:42.176 --> 01:23:43.756]  But how do you get people to self-censorship?
[01:23:44.116 --> 01:23:49.082]  You get them to believe they're being surveilled all the time, that they can be censored at any time, that they can be shamed for their support at any time.
[01:23:49.503 --> 01:23:50.144]  That's how you do it.
[01:23:50.164 --> 01:23:50.924]  That's how you achieve it.
[01:23:50.965 --> 01:23:52.747]  That's how the objective is accomplished.
[01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:54.068]  And that's what they're trying to do here.
[01:23:54.088 --> 01:24:01.898]  They're trying to terrorize the audience and terrorize future Alex Joneses from ever participating in this thought free press experience.
[01:24:02.979 --> 01:24:08.081]  And on YouTube and Facebook, if you're a quote, conspiracy person, that just means questioning the official narrative.
[01:24:08.221 --> 01:24:10.281]  If you attack me, they allow you to do it.
[01:24:10.802 --> 01:24:12.062]  And so they're monetized.
[01:24:12.142 --> 01:24:16.023]  And so all these people that used to like me, now their business is attacking me.
[01:24:16.464 --> 01:24:17.284]  Hundreds of channels.
[01:24:17.924 --> 01:24:24.209]  Because suddenly they don't get censored and they get monetized and so now all these channels are attack Alex Jones channels.
[01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:28.513]  So they're hitting me from the questioning angle and they're hitting me from the establishment angle.
[01:24:28.793 --> 01:24:31.035]  I've talked to a bunch of family, neighbors, crew here.
[01:24:31.476 --> 01:24:33.798]  They've got Time Warner, changed his name to Spectrum.
[01:24:35.017 --> 01:24:37.118]  And they have local news here run by CNN.
[01:24:37.558 --> 01:24:42.179]  Literally every 15 minutes, there's an attack piece that just re-rolls.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.801]  And they even use old footage and go, here's Alex Jones losing in court.
[01:24:45.841 --> 01:24:47.461]  Here's Alex Jones who says he's crazy.
[01:24:47.741 --> 01:24:49.922]  Here's Alex Jones who's a racist.
[01:24:49.982 --> 01:24:52.783]  Jones is being taken off the internet for being anti-Semitic.
[01:24:52.843 --> 01:24:56.144]  And it's like 1984, but really it's not even me.
[01:24:56.184 --> 01:24:58.625]  It's that tarot card of Alex Jones.
[01:24:58.645 --> 01:24:59.785]  They've just created it.
[01:24:59.805 --> 01:25:01.626]  And one of the really astute things you point out,
[01:25:01.766 --> 01:25:08.930]  Because I read a lot of history myself, I never get into this enough, is America's real history was way more rich and way more complex.
[01:25:09.711 --> 01:25:12.492]  And anytime you talk about real history, they go, oh, you're defending it.
[01:25:12.612 --> 01:25:12.992]  No, no, no.
[01:25:13.012 --> 01:25:13.933]  It was the time they lived.
[01:25:13.953 --> 01:25:15.294]  There were blacks that owned slaves.
[01:25:15.734 --> 01:25:17.035]  There are still slaves in Africa.
[01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:20.977]  There were all these different forms of systems.
[01:25:21.017 --> 01:25:22.298]  And you talk about how Hollywood
[01:25:23.447 --> 01:25:30.931]  Demonized real American history, where New Yorkers and people still believe anywhere in the South there's KKK running around and burning crosses.
[01:25:31.932 --> 01:25:35.073]  And all of that Hollywood move actually built up the KKK for a while.
[01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:38.455]  And now they've again created this whole false narrative where we're all scared of each other.
[01:25:38.695 --> 01:25:39.095]  Absolutely.
[01:25:39.115 --> 01:25:43.517]  Like you go back and you study American history, they've tried to demonize poor white Southern culture in particular.
[01:25:43.878 --> 01:25:46.419]  People who think that Deliverance is a documentary of the South.
[01:25:47.099 --> 01:25:48.760]  Which was my experience when I was up at Yale.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:59.865]  And the reason that I started to study this phenomenon that happened to both African-American culture and poor white culture, because they had a narrative of life experience that was different than the institutional narrative they spread in the civics books in third grade.
[01:26:00.345 --> 01:26:03.307]  They understood, I mean you go back you discover that there was a
[01:26:03.587 --> 01:26:08.110]  There was biracial coalitions between poor white Southerners and African-Americans going back to the 1830s.
[01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:13.794]  Many of the poor whites of the mountains of East Tennessee and places like that voted against slavery, voted against the Civil War.
[01:26:14.134 --> 01:26:19.918]  Many of them later joined the Populist, the original Populist movement from where the term originates, the People's Party of the 1890s.
[01:26:20.398 --> 01:26:28.644]  Then after that, and that's why they, what people don't know is that in fact, not only did they disfranchise most African-Americans in the South, but the institutional powers that be disfranchised most poor whites in the South.
[01:26:28.664 --> 01:26:33.327]  And the robber barons from, as you said, the 1830s learned to fear populist coalitions.
[01:26:33.587 --> 01:26:33.987]  Precisely.
[01:26:34.108 --> 01:26:39.192]  Everything you hear about anti-racism is actually making people all hate each other so we don't have coalitions.
[01:26:39.292 --> 01:26:39.652]  Exactly.
[01:26:39.692 --> 01:26:45.057]  It's why Black Lives Matter celebrates divisive events rather than events like my case in Milwaukee that brought people together.
[01:26:45.097 --> 01:26:46.758]  Your big case you just won that you can't talk about.
[01:26:46.898 --> 01:26:47.219]  Precisely.
[01:26:47.239 --> 01:26:48.200]  It was a unifying case.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:51.442]  It was a case when people looked at that, they didn't see the color... They settled in day three of the trial?
[01:26:51.622 --> 01:26:52.623]  That's correct.
[01:26:52.783 --> 01:26:57.868]  And it's a case where the jury and the public didn't see the color of his skin, they saw a human being.
[01:26:58.228 --> 01:27:03.812]  And when you get that achievement, you get cross-racial, biracial, cross-political coalitions that are humanitarian-based.
[01:27:03.932 --> 01:27:04.633]  Shared experience.
[01:27:04.833 --> 01:27:05.354]  Absolutely.
[01:27:05.694 --> 01:27:06.875]  And that's real power.
[01:27:07.095 --> 01:27:08.316]  And that's the power they're afraid of.
[01:27:08.376 --> 01:27:09.477]  That's the power they're scared of.
[01:27:09.857 --> 01:27:22.367]  I mean, you're talking about corporate elites and economic elites who are looking at trying to automate large portions of labor and employment, looking at AI as a solution for their future labor needs and other needs, who increasingly don't see human beings as human beings.
[01:27:22.707 --> 01:27:25.629]  That's why they can support wars that drop bombs.
[01:27:25.649 --> 01:27:27.971]  Oh, they say, we're replacing you, we're making a post-human
[01:27:28.631 --> 01:27:28.972]  Exactly.
[01:27:28.992 --> 01:27:30.172]  They want a drone-driven era.
[01:27:30.472 --> 01:27:35.516]  They want, you know, the idea that drones could drop a bomb and kill a bunch of kids in a school doesn't bother them.
[01:27:35.536 --> 01:27:36.556]  They don't blink an eye about it.
[01:27:36.977 --> 01:27:48.204]  So it's the lack of humanitarianism within key positions of power around the world that is now being threatened by the popular and populist revolutions and rebellions that are taking place, not only across the United States, but across Europe and the world.
[01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:50.565]  And they're afraid of that, need to oppress that and suppress that.
[01:27:50.585 --> 01:27:51.366]  What would you call this?
[01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:52.708]  I don't know.
[01:28:00.393 --> 01:28:04.394]  If they weren't in deep trouble, they wouldn't need to be waging the personal war they're waging against you.
[01:28:04.854 --> 01:28:19.838]  So if they were in fact safely ensconced and felt completely as safe as a baby rocking in their mother's arms, they wouldn't need to be attacking you, demonizing you, constant lawfare waged against you, constant blacklisting on social media against you.
[01:28:19.858 --> 01:28:20.898]  They wouldn't need to do all of that.
[01:28:21.238 --> 01:28:23.659]  They need to do all of that because we're in a transitional period.
[01:28:23.959 --> 01:28:26.821]  We're in a period where either the people are going to win or the elites are going to win.
[01:28:27.121 --> 01:28:30.924]  Where the future is either going to be little d democratic or totally capital A authoritarian.
[01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:33.045]  And that's what they know, that's what they recognize.
[01:28:33.085 --> 01:28:35.767]  And to their credit, they realize that they're up against it.
[01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:39.390]  They realize that they're on the cusp of losing the power that they've long sought.
[01:28:39.670 --> 01:28:42.412]  And that's why they're waging a personal war against you and Infowar.
[01:28:43.072 --> 01:28:45.434]  Well, people just heard total Veritas, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:46.594]  That's why it's happening.
[01:28:46.614 --> 01:28:48.516]  They looked and said, who's Mr. Anti-Globalist?
[01:28:48.996 --> 01:28:51.038]  They said he's ground zero.
[01:28:51.118 --> 01:28:51.599]  Get him.
[01:28:52.039 --> 01:28:53.341]  That's why your support is so critical.
[01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:55.223]  We'll be back to look at Trump.
[01:28:55.703 --> 01:28:57.465]  He's set to start the indictments and arrests.
[01:28:57.525 --> 01:28:58.686]  It's really gonna happen, folks.
[01:28:59.087 --> 01:29:00.488]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:02.715 --> 01:29:09.357]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:29:09.537 --> 01:29:10.617]  My name is Blackberry.
[01:29:10.737 --> 01:29:12.218]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[01:29:12.418 --> 01:29:14.918]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[01:29:15.338 --> 01:29:18.999]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.980]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:24.301]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:29:24.441 --> 01:29:29.502]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[01:29:29.522 --> 01:29:30.262]  Are you nervous?
[01:29:30.523 --> 01:29:30.703]  Yes.
[01:29:30.723 --> 01:29:32.103]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[01:29:33.146 --> 01:29:33.306]  No.
[01:29:34.006 --> 01:29:39.369]  And for the children and the people that support it are gonna realize that this is gonna be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:45.031]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[01:29:45.211 --> 01:29:46.952]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[01:29:47.032 --> 01:29:47.693]  And shake your butt!
[01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:48.933]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[01:30:21.943 --> 01:30:25.064]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[01:30:25.585 --> 01:30:30.287]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[01:30:30.427 --> 01:30:32.688]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[01:30:32.848 --> 01:30:34.569]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[01:30:34.689 --> 01:30:36.269]  Are you nervous?
[01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:38.971]  Yes.
[01:30:39.011 --> 01:30:40.131]  They were all accepting.
[01:30:40.171 --> 01:30:44.633]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[01:30:44.793 --> 01:30:47.394]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[01:30:47.514 --> 01:30:48.515]  A stardom young, right?
[01:30:48.775 --> 01:30:50.396]  A stardom young, right?
[01:30:51.076 --> 01:30:52.857]  The woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs.
[01:30:52.917 --> 01:30:53.598]  It's a man.
[01:30:54.438 --> 01:30:56.099]  This is adult entertainment.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.861]  But what do predators do?
[01:30:57.901 --> 01:30:59.021]  They target children.
[01:30:59.141 --> 01:30:59.642]  Breaking news.
[01:30:59.662 --> 01:31:08.468]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston public library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:31:08.768 --> 01:31:17.174]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:20.756]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[01:31:21.016 --> 01:31:23.837]  This is Tatiana Malina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[01:31:24.077 --> 01:31:26.497]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[01:31:26.917 --> 01:31:34.079]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[01:31:34.139 --> 01:31:36.699]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[01:31:36.939 --> 01:31:38.880]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.001]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[01:31:43.041 --> 01:31:47.882]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[01:31:48.462 --> 01:31:54.385]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?!
[01:31:54.946 --> 01:31:56.587]  What planet did I wake up in?!
[01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:07.713]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:10.735]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[01:32:10.755 --> 01:32:12.716]  This is the best deal we've ever offered.
[01:32:13.356 --> 01:32:14.617]  Free shipping storewide.

[01:32:39.926 --> 01:32:42.326]  Most of these products are lost leaders.
[01:32:42.566 --> 01:32:44.407]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the InfoWar.
[01:32:44.827 --> 01:32:47.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.663 --> 01:33:22.744]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:33:23.104 --> 01:33:24.405]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:53.479 --> 01:33:54.579]  Robert Mars is our guest.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.641]  We're in the midst of a battle between nation states and capitalist prosperity.
[01:33:59.641 --> 01:34:09.545]  And the globalists who use capitalism, crony capitalism for consolidation of power, are trying to pull up the ladders so that the public don't have a chance to become middle class.
[01:34:10.165 --> 01:34:13.606]  We're watching an attempt at global governance post-human system.
[01:34:14.206 --> 01:34:16.207]  And I'm going to get into Trump's plan.
[01:34:17.705 --> 01:34:22.490]  And his move and the statements he's made that they plan criminal prosecutions against the deep state.
[01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:24.952]  And Trump doesn't just say something and then not attempt it.
[01:34:25.012 --> 01:34:26.093]  And most of the time he succeeds.
[01:34:26.133 --> 01:34:27.615]  So it's not just our sources.
[01:34:27.935 --> 01:34:29.256]  I played a bunch of these clips yesterday.
[01:34:29.276 --> 01:34:39.146]  We did a special report on it that's up on Infowars.com that Trump is preparing hundreds of indictments in the next year as he prepares to move against the deep state.
[01:34:39.806 --> 01:34:41.848]  We're talking about how Mr.
[01:34:43.833 --> 01:34:49.882]  Trump plans to carry that out, but also how the system plans to strike back.
[01:34:50.263 --> 01:34:52.146]  So we'll get Bob Barnes take on that in a moment.
[01:34:52.206 --> 01:34:52.687]  First off...
[01:34:54.226 --> 01:35:01.091]  Listen, I need the listeners and the viewers that haven't ever gone to MFWstore.com to go there.
[01:35:01.231 --> 01:35:02.492]  We've got the best toothpaste.

[01:35:04.213 --> 01:35:05.434]  We've got the best turmeric.

[01:35:08.016 --> 01:35:08.756]  It's so amazing.

[01:35:18.308 --> 01:35:20.591]  And we've got the biggest sale in our history so far.
[01:35:20.611 --> 01:35:23.234]  50 to 60% off all the supplements.
[01:35:23.714 --> 01:35:25.396]  Huge discounts on so many other items.
[01:35:26.017 --> 01:35:26.938]  And store-wide free shipping.
[01:35:27.318 --> 01:35:29.200]  Now, it was every supplement, but we sold out.
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.422]  Now it's five different supplements.
[01:35:31.578 --> 01:35:33.359]  But we've still got our best-selling DNA Force.
[01:35:33.819 --> 01:35:35.760]  Never done 60% off, but you see how great it is.
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.121]  We've got a bunch of other big discounts.
[01:35:38.161 --> 01:35:39.962]  Brain Force Plus, the amazing Nootropic.
[01:35:40.462 --> 01:35:42.523]  Leading competitors mark things up seven times.
[01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.084]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:35:44.844 --> 01:35:47.805]  We always discount it down to $29.
[01:35:48.906 --> 01:35:51.007]  It's $15.98.
[01:35:51.847 --> 01:35:51.007]  $15.98.
[01:35:52.267 --> 01:35:53.408]  We've never sold it that low.
[01:35:53.868 --> 01:35:54.849]  And by the way, it's our best seller.
[01:35:54.869 --> 01:35:55.629]  We sell a ton of it.
[01:35:56.029 --> 01:35:56.950]  So stock up on it.
[01:35:57.010 --> 01:35:57.390]  Try it.

[01:36:07.502 --> 01:36:11.385]  The left published hundreds of articles demonizing it and saying go downvote it, go downrate it.
[01:36:19.531 --> 01:36:22.413]  Even though you've got to be a proven customer to do it, they still engage in fraud and don't.
[01:36:22.934 --> 01:36:25.075]  They make an order, get the order number, and then cancel it.
[01:36:25.395 --> 01:36:28.878]  But I mean, they're just anything they can do to try to stop us.
[01:36:28.898 --> 01:36:29.939]  There's armies of these scum.
[01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:32.861]  So that was at a 98% in the last month.
[01:36:32.921 --> 01:36:33.662]  It's gone to 92%.
[01:36:33.762 --> 01:36:36.284]  So, I mean, they are hitting us and hitting us hard.
[01:36:36.304 --> 01:36:37.425]  6,000 plus reviews.
[01:36:37.805 --> 01:36:39.186]  But just experience it for yourself.
[01:36:39.746 --> 01:36:41.668]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[01:36:51.873 --> 01:36:52.693]  And I want to expand.
[01:36:52.753 --> 01:36:53.814]  I want to launch new shows.
[01:36:54.314 --> 01:36:55.814]  And I want to take care of the great crew we've got.
[01:36:55.954 --> 01:36:57.715]  So I thank you all who've been supporting us.

[01:37:04.856 --> 01:37:05.956]  You just pick when it comes.

[01:37:06.937 --> 01:37:07.617]  Cancel any time.
[01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:11.378]  But that way, it's like a tie to the Church of Free Speech and Americana.
[01:37:12.018 --> 01:37:13.998]  That way, you know it's going in every month.

[01:37:26.922 --> 01:37:29.282]  Save the First Amendment, specials got in in the next few days.
[01:37:29.963 --> 01:37:31.583]  Bob, so you heard my preface there.
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:34.201]  Where do you want to take this?
[01:37:34.221 --> 01:37:35.741]  Because you've got a lot of historical knowledge.
[01:37:35.761 --> 01:37:37.922]  You've been to a lot of the high-level lawyer meetings.
[01:37:37.962 --> 01:37:43.785]  You met with some of the top editors in the country recently about their kill shot on me as a kill shot on the free speech.
[01:37:44.206 --> 01:37:45.806]  They don't want to make the kill shot on free speech.
[01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:47.627]  They go, oh, it's the bad guy Alex Jones.
[01:37:48.008 --> 01:37:50.809]  But while we're debating Alex Jones, they take everyone down.
[01:37:50.889 --> 01:37:54.311]  That's why we've got to be defended because we've been picked as the test case.
[01:37:54.811 --> 01:37:56.172]  Moving on from that to Trump.
[01:37:57.272 --> 01:38:03.977]  And what we just talked about, and the video that's on Infowars.com, we'll put on screen so TV viewers and others can go there, find it, and share it.
[01:38:04.717 --> 01:38:08.820]  We had 40 minutes on this commercial free last night, but we're going to recap it now, a condensed version.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:10.421]  He says he's going to move.
[01:38:10.701 --> 01:38:11.882]  He always does what he says.
[01:38:12.402 --> 01:38:13.263]  World exclusive.
[01:38:13.563 --> 01:38:16.125]  Trump plans to prosecute hundreds of deep staters in 2019.
[01:38:17.045 --> 01:38:18.346]  A, he says he's doing it.
[01:38:18.967 --> 01:38:19.867]  How do you think he should do it?
[01:38:19.887 --> 01:38:20.608]  What are the pitfalls?
[01:38:20.888 --> 01:38:36.737]  Well, one of the first places that should be a high-priority item are all the people who gave unauthorized access to the NSA databases that allowed all kinds of illicit searches that started happening in late 2015 and didn't get shut down until Rogers shut it down after he was appointed by Trump.
[01:38:37.137 --> 01:38:38.078]  So that needs to happen.
[01:38:38.098 --> 01:38:41.220]  And you look at, like, Samantha- He came and visited the president and said, this is illegal, sir.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:41.920]  Exactly.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.702]  And the FISA court covered its ass and put out a report saying we were giving illegal searches.
[01:38:45.742 --> 01:38:46.723]  It's not like this is a secret.
[01:38:47.023 --> 01:38:47.323]  Exactly.
[01:38:47.363 --> 01:38:49.925]  Samantha Powers was doing hundreds of illegal searches.
[01:38:50.205 --> 01:38:52.567]  Susan Rice was doing all kinds of illegal searches.
[01:38:52.928 --> 01:38:55.850]  So these people need to be focused on and they need to be targeted.
[01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:57.431]  They need to be investigated.
[01:38:57.731 --> 01:39:14.604]  And it needs to stop because there needs to be a message that when you have the keys to the most powerful surveillance mechanism the world has ever known, which is the Echelon and other database systems that exist at the National Security Agency, that if they are used for domestic spying and political opposition purposes, heads have to roll.
[01:39:14.864 --> 01:39:16.145]  There have to be consequences.
[01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:17.946]  Because that, I mean, that is technocracy.
[01:39:17.986 --> 01:39:18.826]  That is total control.
[01:39:19.046 --> 01:39:19.646]  Look at China.
[01:39:19.926 --> 01:39:20.446]  No escape.
[01:39:20.526 --> 01:39:23.827]  Chinese VIP jail puts AI monitors in every cell.
[01:39:24.168 --> 01:39:24.568]  Exactly.
[01:39:24.588 --> 01:39:30.350]  I mean, the Chinese are, the, basically what was happening was Obama was using a Chinese model on U.S.
[01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:31.230]  American politics.
[01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:40.576]  And was the first time mass-scale, wholesale, illicit investigations of people without them knowing it, without their knowledge, and sharing it widespread.
[01:39:41.236 --> 01:39:43.058]  That's one of the reasons why he should pardon General Flynn.
[01:39:43.338 --> 01:39:56.266]  He should pardon General Flynn and say this is the product of illicit surveillance by people like Sally Yates, by people like Samantha Powers, by people like Susan Rice, and get involved and use it as an opportunity to make sure it can never happen again.
[01:39:56.326 --> 01:40:00.389]  It's not only about the President getting remedy against those people who have illicitly armed him.
[01:40:00.729 --> 01:40:02.770]  It's about stopping this from reoccurring ever again.
[01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:06.673]  There needs to be a message that, hey, if you do this, you're going to face real consequences.
[01:40:07.013 --> 01:40:09.154]  And you're going to face consequences worse than Paul Manafort.
[01:40:09.455 --> 01:40:10.916]  And Paul Manafort's being put on trial.
[01:40:10.936 --> 01:40:11.576]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:11.836 --> 01:40:12.837]  And that's what needs to happen.
[01:40:12.857 --> 01:40:17.119]  If Paul Manafort is the only guy that's harshly punished in all of this, then the wrong message has been sent.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:28.106]  Well, when you use the NSA to bring in a pro-CHICOM global government and implode our borders, that is the definition of using the military power and might, and that's what the NSA is, to overthrow your country.
[01:40:28.186 --> 01:40:28.927]  It is high treason.
[01:40:29.247 --> 01:40:29.767]  Absolutely.
[01:40:30.008 --> 01:40:31.188]  It's what led to the Church Committee.
[01:40:31.389 --> 01:40:39.214]  Senator Frank Church from Idaho was the first person domestically and illicitly spied upon by the original National Security Agency in the late 1960s.
[01:40:39.594 --> 01:40:43.957]  So after Watergate, he used it as his opportunity to go after them, to expose them to the world.
[01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:57.847]  That's how we found out about the horrible things our government, our own government, MKUltra, MKUltra, Tuskegee, the nuclear, you know, doing a nuclear test and not telling people that there's problems with it by going out and encouraging them to do picnics and watch it.
[01:40:57.867 --> 01:40:58.507]  I mean, they're still old
[01:40:58.527 --> 01:41:01.289]  By the way, it turned out a lot more just came out.
[01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:10.094]  They only gave them the least worst stuff, but then there were whistleblowers, so they gave them basically some of the files of each project, but something like 95% never got turned over.
[01:41:10.394 --> 01:41:10.854]  Absolutely.
[01:41:10.874 --> 01:41:12.235]  And it's become systematic.
[01:41:12.635 --> 01:41:17.598]  So, I mean, Duke University today had to pay a $100 million fine for faking environmental research on U.S.
[01:41:18.119 --> 01:41:18.799]  government grants.
[01:41:19.279 --> 01:41:22.001]  And another whistleblower report that came out.
[01:41:22.321 --> 01:41:36.871]  So that kind of problematic behavior at the very top with the most powerful law enforcement and intelligence operation in the world misused our Five Eyes relationships because they were using Australian and US sources and UK sources to illicitly spy on the President and his allies.
[01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:41.954]  There has to be consequences for that because if there are not consequences for that they will do it again and they will do it on a broader
[01:41:42.214 --> 01:41:54.265]  Absolutely, that is true election meddling and now letting big tech that's bigger than the NSA in many ways operate wildly and then Trump letting the EU and others with fines basically tacitly take control of internet regulation.
[01:41:54.725 --> 01:41:58.388]  Trump must come in with prohibited legislation to free the internet.
[01:41:58.749 --> 01:42:01.151]  Absolutely, because one of the great secrets
[01:42:01.511 --> 01:42:04.972]  Is that the degree to which big tech is deeply in bed with the deep state.
[01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:12.094]  So Google, Facebook, all the social media giants, use their algorithms, use the data that they're gathering on individuals.
[01:42:12.194 --> 01:42:15.134]  They're taking direction from the Obama stay behind network.
[01:42:15.494 --> 01:42:21.516]  And we come back, I'm going to show you exclusive proof of who's behind the lawsuits against us in Connecticut, who's actually directing it for the CIA.
[01:42:22.256 --> 01:42:22.656]  Precisely.
[01:42:22.696 --> 01:42:40.490]  So what you have is you have people who are propagating, who are lead propagandists for suppressing speech in this country, for illicit surveillance in this country, who are pushing the attempted deep state coup against the president, who are also deeply invested and deeply involved, directly or indirectly, in the lawfare and the political warfare they're waging against you.
[01:42:41.727 --> 01:42:45.969]  We're going to show you the breakaway rogue group inside the government.
[01:42:46.009 --> 01:42:47.329]  They, oh, they're so scared of this.
[01:42:47.749 --> 01:42:50.570]  Chris Murphy is so scared of us right now that we put this out.
[01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:51.531]  That's why they want us off air.
[01:42:51.551 --> 01:42:53.071]  That's why they demanded the platforming.
[01:42:53.411 --> 01:42:59.674]  Because there's an illegal breakaway group still operating against America run by Senator Chris Murphy.
[01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:05.992]  Democrats are pushing for full-term abortions.
[01:43:06.112 --> 01:43:07.453]  The infant would be delivered.
[01:43:08.134 --> 01:43:10.095]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[01:43:10.456 --> 01:43:15.119]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:19.242]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers.
[01:43:19.602 --> 01:43:23.445]  And telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family.
[01:43:23.685 --> 01:43:28.549]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:31.071]  Is it okay to still have children?
[01:43:31.826 --> 01:43:37.590]  I told you 24 years ago that the globalists have an anti-human, anti-child agenda.
[01:43:38.511 --> 01:43:40.933]  And back then, it was more secretive, only in their white papers.
[01:43:40.993 --> 01:43:42.113]  Now, it's all over the news.
[01:43:42.934 --> 01:43:52.701]  In fact, Alexandria Cortez, or AOC, doesn't just say you shouldn't have children, but that the world's going to end in 12 years.
[01:43:52.781 --> 01:43:59.406]  And, of course, the governor of Virginia, when he's not running around in blackface, well, he's saying they're going to kill babies after they're born.
[01:44:00.749 --> 01:44:05.991]  And Trump tried to get a bill passed to not kill babies after they're born, which is already the law.
[01:44:06.631 --> 01:44:09.992]  And the Democrats in the Senate shot it down.
[01:44:10.373 --> 01:44:14.674]  Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children.
[01:44:15.134 --> 01:44:22.477]  The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth.
[01:44:22.897 --> 01:44:24.117]  This is America.
[01:44:24.178 --> 01:44:24.858]  This is the world.
[01:44:26.739 --> 01:44:30.704]  2019 brought to you by the technocrats, the eugenicists, the globalists.
[01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:33.948]  They call themselves fascists, liberals, communists, socialists.
[01:44:34.048 --> 01:44:34.548]  It's all the same.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:36.521]  Watch my film in-game.
[01:44:36.621 --> 01:44:38.442]  It's free online until they delete it.
[01:44:38.462 --> 01:44:39.983]  I made it 11 years ago.
[01:44:40.404 --> 01:44:41.945]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:44:42.525 --> 01:44:59.098]  Now that said, if they can't abort a baby before it's born, or now kill it after it's born, and not fill them full of all these toxic vaccines tainted by design to brain damage them, if they can't fry us with electromagnetic cell phone radiation or GMO, or brainwash us with this toxic culture,
[01:45:00.029 --> 01:45:05.633]  They're going to hit us with people having major mineral and vitamin deficiencies.
[01:45:06.454 --> 01:45:13.319]  And the biggest deficiency in the mainline studies in America and around the world is pure iodine.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:14.940]  In fact, going back in the 20s,
[01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:20.868]  The IQs were 15, 20, 25, 30 points lower.
[01:45:20.928 --> 01:45:24.852]  There was major deformity, major gout, major problems with the thyroid.
[01:45:25.193 --> 01:45:32.020]  And the federal government put a cruddy form of iodine in the salt and IQs went up on average 15 points.
[01:45:32.401 --> 01:45:33.802]  The deformities went way down.
[01:45:34.823 --> 01:45:37.626]  Our environment is lacking iodine.
[01:45:38.581 --> 01:45:45.445]  That's why coastal populations live longer on average, because they do get some seafood that has some iodine, but a lot of that seafood is contaminated.
[01:45:46.085 --> 01:45:51.848]  And of course, in the olden days, until just like a hundred years ago, people ground up bones and put it in their bread.
[01:45:52.048 --> 01:45:58.071]  Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, be they alive or be they dead, I'll grind their bones to make my bread.
[01:45:59.452 --> 01:46:03.334]  But the good news is, for your children, for adults, for everybody,
[01:46:04.218 --> 01:46:12.481]  We have the pure deep earth crystal iodine in original X2 that nobody else has and nobody else has brought to market.
[01:46:12.601 --> 01:46:17.983]  Now I brought out X3 because some scientists said you need all three types of iodine and some folks like it better.
[01:46:18.804 --> 01:46:22.125]  But I was able to secure with the original manufacturer
[01:46:22.845 --> 01:46:38.348]  A better deal by breaking my deal with them and playing guts ball where it's only been sold out for a couple months and we got the new deal done just about a month ago and they are manufacturing it now so people get on the waiting list.
[01:46:38.848 --> 01:46:47.610]  In about two weeks we'll be shipping X2 original all deep earth crystal pure atomic iodine directly to your door.
[01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:49.330]  Across the world.
[01:46:49.771 --> 01:46:50.591]  X2 is back.
[01:46:50.931 --> 01:46:51.931]  It'll be here in two weeks.
[01:46:52.832 --> 01:46:56.013]  This is a blessing, so get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:46:56.033 --> 01:46:57.193]  Again, thank you for your support.
[01:46:57.453 --> 01:47:00.235]  Let's support your own body with the purest, best iodine out there.
[01:47:00.615 --> 01:47:02.015]  X2 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:47:05.877 --> 01:47:08.538]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:43.044 --> 01:47:44.326]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:47:44.366 --> 01:47:45.167]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:47:45.647 --> 01:47:47.770]  Attorney Robert Barnes is here with us in the studio.
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:52.956]  Famous, successful First Amendment civil rights lawyer, major litigator, just won a big case, one of the biggest in U.S.
[01:47:52.976 --> 01:47:56.720]  history for civil rights in Milwaukee last week.
[01:47:58.959 --> 01:48:11.262]  We know that Senator Chris Murphy, out of Connecticut, is one of the key authors of the different bills that were attached to the Defense Authorization Act a few years ago.
[01:48:12.062 --> 01:48:19.204]  He's now reintroduced these as well, and it is a breakaway group in the CIA and the Defense Department.
[01:48:20.219 --> 01:48:27.068]  That it interfaces with mainstream news, CNN, MSNBC, to try to overthrow Trump and shut down free press in this country.
[01:48:27.108 --> 01:48:28.690]  They've had the hearings, they've broken it all down.
[01:48:29.051 --> 01:48:30.272]  Document Cam, shot please.
[01:48:30.953 --> 01:48:35.919]  Remember this, Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act into law.
[01:48:36.817 --> 01:48:44.667]  Then they just call everyone Russians, who's domestic, and then they're able to use this money to fund hit pieces, lawsuits, and programs to deplatform folks.
[01:48:44.707 --> 01:48:45.568]  That's now come out.
[01:48:46.429 --> 01:48:50.815]  Murphy, Portman introduced measure to fight propaganda and disinformation.
[01:48:52.594 --> 01:48:55.197]  And so they already passed it in 2016, as you can see here.
[01:48:55.217 --> 01:48:57.660]  This is from his senate.gov website.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.281]  This is directly from the senator.
[01:48:59.742 --> 01:49:06.910]  He tells you that he did this before, had to put the Defense Authorization Act, and then Obama signed executive orders as well.
[01:49:07.410 --> 01:49:09.353]  And these are groups of Democrats in the government
[01:49:10.421 --> 01:49:14.783]  With national security clearances, working against yours truly, President Trump, and others.
[01:49:14.823 --> 01:49:24.608]  And he was just on television last week saying, I killed one of the fathers of one of the Sandy Hook victims because I'm quote terrorizing them and I need to be taken off the air.
[01:49:24.628 --> 01:49:29.730]  And then it's quote, the democratic, democracy depends on Alex Jones and others being taken off.
[01:49:30.110 --> 01:49:32.931]  And he blamed Google and Facebook and YouTube.
[01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:35.973]  So they're trying to bully them under his control.
[01:49:36.753 --> 01:49:40.314]  And Trump's sitting on the sidelines while this happens saying, we're not going to regulate.
[01:49:40.574 --> 01:49:47.256]  Well, you've let the Democrats then, by the vacuum, and the EU, and all of them, come in with the regulation.
[01:49:48.777 --> 01:49:50.937]  And now you see Zuckerberg saying, yeah, go ahead and regulate me.
[01:49:51.357 --> 01:49:54.498]  That's because they'll have protection of law to censor.
[01:49:54.558 --> 01:49:56.439]  So I'm going to explain that again.
[01:49:57.399 --> 01:50:01.961]  Trump's done a great job on so many fronts, but this is his only big failure, is not fighting the censorship.
[01:50:02.001 --> 01:50:02.481]  He started.
[01:50:04.313 --> 01:50:10.200]  A few weeks ago with the move to strip the money of public universities that engage in this malice brainwashing.
[01:50:10.481 --> 01:50:12.183]  They're now centers of anti-free speech.
[01:50:12.223 --> 01:50:12.603]  That's good.
[01:50:13.144 --> 01:50:22.675]  But first, Mr. Barnes looking at this and the magnitude of it and that he's at the heart of quarterbacking all this and he wants me off the air.
[01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:25.050]  And then getting into what you think Trump should do.
[01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:25.870]  Absolutely.
[01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:42.417]  So, I mean, it's part of a coordinated campaign and the fact that Senator Murphy's on both sides of these, that he's out there promoting a message about the lawsuits, that propagandizes his reason to censor, shame, and control what people can say, what people can hear, what people can speak, what people can think.
[01:50:42.657 --> 01:50:44.679]  And he's the one constantly bringing up Sandy Hook, not me.
[01:50:44.919 --> 01:50:45.419]  Absolutely.
[01:50:45.719 --> 01:50:55.927]  So he's using it as his political excuse, his political premise, his political predicate, in order to engage in the thought control, speech control, and press control that he wants to have happen.
[01:50:56.247 --> 01:51:03.392]  And it's part of an ongoing campaign where they recognize that if people are allowed to get free press, get independent press, get independent... He'll lose.
[01:51:03.712 --> 01:51:04.212]  Precisely.
[01:51:04.493 --> 01:51:06.094]  They can't win in an open debate.
[01:51:06.474 --> 01:51:07.575]  That's what the real admission is.
[01:51:07.595 --> 01:51:21.821]  I mean, the reason why we have free speech and free press both together in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is because it's the independent free press and the independent free speech of ordinary people and everyday people across the world that ends up getting us to the best place to protect our freedoms and our liberties.
[01:51:22.181 --> 01:51:32.886]  That respects the audience, that respects people to make up their own mind, and that respects the power of the idea to be successful, not rely on the power of the person who controls the microphone to be successful.
[01:51:33.266 --> 01:51:43.255]  And so what he believes, and what Senator Murphy believes, and a lot of these other Democratic politicians believe, and Big Tech believes, is that the great danger to America is freedom of thought, is freedom of speech, is freedom of press.
[01:51:43.515 --> 01:51:50.661]  There's a reason why it's in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, because it was necessary to secure every other liberty, is independent free press.
[01:51:50.782 --> 01:51:56.146]  Not the big press, the little press, the everyday press, the independent press, that is critical and essential and fundamental.
[01:51:56.186 --> 01:51:59.649]  And that's getting into the First Amendment, I want you to get back into that, you're an expert in, but specifically,
[01:52:00.570 --> 01:52:03.512]  One of Trump's main failings is he can't get people appointed.
[01:52:03.532 --> 01:52:04.953]  He can't get into the bureaucracy.
[01:52:04.993 --> 01:52:05.693]  He's starting to.
[01:52:06.134 --> 01:52:11.717]  The first thing he needs to do, this is who captains and runs the censorship, is this stay-behind group.
[01:52:12.117 --> 01:52:18.001]  And one of the few areas a commander-in-chief can actually reverse congressional funding is how it's designated.
[01:52:18.341 --> 01:52:23.684]  He should take the money out of this group and put it towards the wall, or put it towards amputees or something, or bonuses for the troops.
[01:52:23.985 --> 01:52:29.268]  Not billions of dollars, over $2 billion total now, to finance the destruction of the press.
[01:52:29.688 --> 01:52:30.149]  Absolutely.
[01:52:30.689 --> 01:52:42.319]  It's deeply ironic that the very people who supported the seditious activity of the Deep State against the President are now trying to reclassify and redefine opposition to the institutional press and institutional power as itself seditious.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:45.622]  And he shouldn't be any part of supporting it, any part of subsidizing it.
[01:52:45.903 --> 01:52:46.723]  He should defang it.
[01:52:47.004 --> 01:52:48.005]  He should demonetize it.
[01:52:48.045 --> 01:52:50.206]  He should do what YouTube has done to everybody who is independent.
[01:52:50.226 --> 01:52:52.689]  We have found the reactor shaft on the Death Star.
[01:52:53.732 --> 01:52:55.533]  I mean, this takes them out.
[01:52:55.873 --> 01:52:56.413]  Oh, precisely.
[01:52:56.613 --> 01:53:01.914]  This is their last gasp at social control, at media control, at thought control, and at press control.
[01:53:01.934 --> 01:53:08.416]  They're using state tools and state organs to achieve it and to attain it, and the president needs to take action to make sure it doesn't happen.
[01:53:08.496 --> 01:53:10.277]  I mean, we have a CIA body.
[01:53:10.477 --> 01:53:11.417]  This is back to Frank Church.
[01:53:11.837 --> 01:53:12.438]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:13.598 --> 01:53:16.919]  In fact, were you guys able to grab the trailer for Enemy of the State like I was asking?
[01:53:19.431 --> 01:53:19.831]  We have it.
[01:53:19.911 --> 01:53:22.112]  I mean, this is Gene Hackman and Will Smith.
[01:53:22.272 --> 01:53:22.912]  Great movie.
[01:53:22.932 --> 01:53:24.393]  Gene Hackman's probably my favorite actor.
[01:53:24.953 --> 01:53:25.513]  So classy.
[01:53:25.553 --> 01:53:26.873]  Wish he wouldn't retire, but I understand.
[01:53:27.694 --> 01:53:29.254]  And so sick of Hollywood.
[01:53:29.274 --> 01:53:30.995]  He lives like in North Carolina or something on a ranch.
[01:53:31.595 --> 01:53:33.456]  But this is based on how real stuff works.
[01:53:33.476 --> 01:53:37.477]  With the deep state, a breakaway group inside the NSA
[01:53:38.743 --> 01:53:43.326]  is using their power to try to bring in a police state for the globalists.
[01:53:43.726 --> 01:53:44.587]  Again, the police aren't bad.
[01:53:44.607 --> 01:53:45.467]  It's the police state.
[01:53:45.487 --> 01:53:47.068]  It means bad guys in control.
[01:53:47.088 --> 01:53:47.648]  Things like this.
[01:53:47.968 --> 01:53:48.769]  This is a police state.
[01:53:49.469 --> 01:53:51.370]  And they discovered that they're killing people.
[01:53:51.911 --> 01:53:57.034]  They discovered they've killed a senator who's trying to stop them from the illegal spying.
[01:53:57.094 --> 01:53:59.275]  And this is actually how the real world works.
[01:53:59.535 --> 01:54:02.437]  And Chris Murphy is the bad guy in this movie.
[01:54:02.477 --> 01:54:03.558]  He's one of the kingpins.
[01:54:04.078 --> 01:54:05.779]  It's just outrageously criminal.
[01:54:05.999 --> 01:54:07.260]  Let's go ahead and roll that trailer, please.
[01:54:09.335 --> 01:54:09.535]  Hi.
[01:54:09.756 --> 01:54:13.199]  Hey, hi.
[01:54:13.339 --> 01:54:15.441]  So you want some lingerie for your wife?
[01:54:15.861 --> 01:54:16.322]  Uh, yes.
[01:54:17.543 --> 01:54:20.525]  I'm not really experienced in this.
[01:54:20.685 --> 01:54:21.786]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:54:21.827 --> 01:54:23.228]  I mean, I'm experienced.
[01:54:23.268 --> 01:54:26.271]  You know, I don't want to come in here and look stupid.
[01:54:26.551 --> 01:54:26.951]  Too late.
[01:54:27.011 --> 01:54:27.472]  Yeah.
[01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:30.191]  Should have gotten her a watch.
[01:54:31.191 --> 01:54:33.693]  Robert Clayton Dean was innocent.
[01:54:35.914 --> 01:54:40.056]  We have reason to believe that Mr. Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you.
[01:54:40.076 --> 01:54:40.717]  What kind of materials?
[01:54:41.137 --> 01:54:41.777]  Sensitive, sir.
[01:54:41.857 --> 01:54:42.738]  Let's get into his life.
[01:54:42.918 --> 01:54:45.680]  They have you bugged, Mr. Dean.
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:46.980]  Move to audio three.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:48.741]  He was unsuspecting.
[01:54:48.761 --> 01:54:49.162]  Hey, hey!
[01:54:49.322 --> 01:54:51.023]  Finding the wrong house?
[01:54:51.203 --> 01:54:51.643]  Hello?
[01:54:52.003 --> 01:54:52.503]  Eric?
[01:54:52.523 --> 01:54:52.904]  Mr. Dean!
[01:54:54.785 --> 01:54:55.905]  He was unaware.
[01:54:55.945 --> 01:54:57.806]  You are the only woman in the world for me.
[01:54:58.467 --> 01:54:59.627]  You and Janet Jackson.
[01:54:59.988 --> 01:55:02.009]  Coming your way over.
[01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:05.351]  Now, what he doesn't know... I'd like to report a break-in.
[01:55:05.411 --> 01:55:06.371]  ...could kill him.
[01:55:06.951 --> 01:55:10.073]  Request immediate keyhole visual tasking, maximum resolution.
[01:55:10.133 --> 01:55:11.354]  He's on your six o'clock!
[01:55:11.394 --> 01:55:12.615]  You have something they want!
[01:55:12.635 --> 01:55:13.375]  Two targets, rooftop.
[01:55:13.395 --> 01:55:14.336]  I don't have anything!
[01:55:14.396 --> 01:55:16.257]  Maybe you do and you don't know it!
[01:55:16.617 --> 01:55:17.397]  You're a threat now.
[01:55:17.497 --> 01:55:17.937]  To whom?
[01:55:18.198 --> 01:55:18.798]  Everyone you know.
[01:55:18.858 --> 01:55:19.638]  Target's on the move.
[01:55:19.718 --> 01:55:20.679]  A name, a phone number?
[01:55:20.719 --> 01:55:21.479]  No, nothing!
[01:55:21.519 --> 01:55:22.440]  He didn't give me anything!
[01:55:24.997 --> 01:55:26.699]  How many federal agents you have following you?
[01:55:27.259 --> 01:55:29.982]  Stay exactly where you are.
[01:55:30.002 --> 01:55:32.884]  I'm gonna use every means possible to get what we need.
[01:55:32.924 --> 01:55:34.085]  From Jerry Bruckheimer.
[01:55:34.105 --> 01:55:34.706]  Get the cat.
[01:55:34.726 --> 01:55:35.687]  What's the cat's name?
[01:55:35.747 --> 01:55:36.147]  Babe.
[01:55:36.227 --> 01:55:37.188]  Producer of The Rock.
[01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:39.090]  Come here, baby.
[01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:40.671]  Baby, come, come, come here.
[01:55:40.791 --> 01:55:42.253]  A film by Tony Scott.
[01:55:42.333 --> 01:55:43.594]  Target is on 21.
[01:55:43.654 --> 01:55:45.035]  Director of Crimson Tide.
[01:55:45.055 --> 01:55:45.696]  Is this about me?
[01:55:45.716 --> 01:55:45.696]  20.
[01:55:45.796 --> 01:55:46.777]  Do they know me? 19.
[01:55:48.618 --> 01:55:49.179]  Who is that?
[01:55:49.199 --> 01:55:49.179]  18?
[01:55:49.299 --> 01:55:50.259]  He jumped to 17!
[01:55:50.299 --> 01:55:51.861]  You didn't know me!
[01:55:52.081 --> 01:55:54.643]  I don't know what you're talking about!
[01:55:55.364 --> 01:55:56.004]  Will Smith.
[01:55:56.104 --> 01:55:57.225]  You're one of them, aren't you?
[01:55:57.546 --> 01:55:58.527]  Former conspirer.
[01:55:58.607 --> 01:56:00.969]  Swing it, Johnny, swing it!
[01:56:01.009 --> 01:56:01.729]  Gene Hackman.
[01:56:01.769 --> 01:56:03.271]  This man, this is our problem.
[01:56:03.311 --> 01:56:05.052]  You live in another day, I'd be very impressed.
[01:56:05.072 --> 01:56:08.235]  It's not paranoia when they're really after you.
[01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.217]  Don't stop it now!
[01:56:13.539 --> 01:56:15.181]  Enemy of the State.
[01:56:16.835 --> 01:56:19.836]  A rogue criminal group trying to take the government over.
[01:56:20.236 --> 01:56:21.916]  That's what always happens in terrible countries.
[01:56:21.936 --> 01:56:22.836]  Now it's happening here.
[01:56:23.096 --> 01:56:23.837]  They've been caught.
[01:56:24.097 --> 01:56:25.057]  The President's talking about it.
[01:56:25.257 --> 01:56:26.477]  He's getting ready to prosecute them.
[01:56:26.797 --> 01:56:28.678]  Move against Chris Murphy now!
[01:56:29.078 --> 01:56:30.578]  Move against Blumenthal and his son!
[01:56:30.898 --> 01:56:31.318]  All of them!
[01:56:31.498 --> 01:56:33.139]  Protect the American people, President!
[01:56:33.359 --> 01:56:35.019]  Our intelligence agencies are good people!
[01:56:35.379 --> 01:56:38.440]  These are enemies working with the CHICOMS, and that's why they want me off air!
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.600]  They're working for the CHICOMS, dammit!
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.521]  Now protect us from these assholes!
[01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:43.641]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:56:44.375 --> 01:57:05.875]  I mean, basically it's a sort of continuous coordinated effort to control thought, speech, and freedom in the United States because of the success of the independent free press, because of the success of people's independent activities politically, because of their empowering the President of the United States to reverse this Chinese model of economic and political control that the big tech is colluding with.
[01:57:06.075 --> 01:57:06.676]  Now they're trying it here.
[01:57:06.696 --> 01:57:07.537]  As Trump said, it's treason.
[01:57:07.557 --> 01:57:07.677]  It is.
[01:57:25.496 --> 01:57:26.316]  No doubt it is.
[01:57:26.476 --> 01:57:31.458]  Chris Murphy is involved in treason against the country, the First Amendment, and is a CHICOM operative.
[01:57:31.658 --> 01:57:32.018]  It's known.
[01:57:32.198 --> 01:57:34.219]  And he's scared, really scared of the show.
[01:57:34.419 --> 01:57:36.419]  He wants us off because we know who you are!
[01:57:36.639 --> 01:57:37.860]  You dirty traitor!
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.480]  You dirty anti-American filth!
[01:57:40.941 --> 01:57:42.281]  You're not going to beat Texas!
[01:57:42.501 --> 01:57:45.102]  You're not going to beat me because you are filth!
[01:57:45.662 --> 01:57:47.062]  God will defeat you!
[01:57:56.115 --> 01:58:00.017]  We have sustained under the total enemy attack of Soros, the Clintons, and their crime syndicate.
[01:58:00.037 --> 01:58:03.338]  They're losing control, they're failing on a global scale, but they're striking back.
[01:58:03.498 --> 01:58:06.300]  We've got to hold the line, and that means financial support.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.320]  And you've done a great job.
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:08.400]  But we make it easy.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:10.461]  RainForce Plus is an amazing nootropic.
[01:58:10.501 --> 01:58:14.843]  We've never had it at 60% off, but I want those of you that haven't used it to see how really great it is.
[01:58:15.003 --> 01:58:18.185]  BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:58:18.205 --> 01:58:19.025]  Nobody else has that.
[01:58:19.045 --> 01:58:21.866]  The ultimate turmeric formula on the planet, from our research.
[01:58:21.886 --> 01:58:22.827]  60% off.
[01:58:22.907 --> 01:58:24.287]  These are lost leaders, by the way.
[01:58:24.407 --> 01:58:25.548]  I want you to see how great they are.
[01:58:25.708 --> 01:58:26.649]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:58:26.749 --> 01:58:30.933]  We've got X2, a limited run of the Deep Earth Crystal Pure Iodine that nobody else has.
[01:58:31.033 --> 01:58:35.377]  I got a pretty good size shipment in, but my goodness, people have been excited about it at 50% off.
[01:58:35.517 --> 01:58:36.899]  It's set to sell out in the next few weeks.
[01:58:36.939 --> 01:58:37.559]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:58:37.759 --> 01:58:40.882]  X2, the latest run, set to sell out 55% off.
[01:58:41.002 --> 01:58:42.984]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:43.004 --> 01:58:42.984]  $17.95.
[01:58:43.024 --> 01:58:45.306]  You can look at that 98% approval rating for that.
[01:58:51.192 --> 01:58:52.254]  DNA Force.
[01:58:52.494 --> 01:58:55.959]  Many leading brands aren't even as strong with the Bio, PQQ, and CoQ10.
[01:58:56.099 --> 01:58:59.344]  Other key factors that slow the death of telomeres, the shrinking of telomeres.
[01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:00.246]  This is all facts.
[01:59:00.386 --> 01:59:01.708]  DNA Force is amazing.
[01:59:01.728 --> 01:59:02.269]  Go read about it.
[01:59:02.349 --> 01:59:03.070]  Leading competitors are $300, $400.
[01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:03.410]  Say it.
[01:59:03.431 --> 01:59:04.332]  Mark it up 5, 6, 7 times.
[01:59:04.352 --> 01:59:04.853]  We mark it up $150.
[01:59:07.096 --> 01:59:07.376]  We're good
[01:59:25.623 --> 01:59:25.883]  We're good.
[01:59:54.574 --> 01:59:58.697]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.217 --> 02:00:00.538]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.262 --> 02:00:18.671]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:19.392 --> 02:00:21.173]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.545 --> 02:00:25.386]  Well, listen, I'll use his name.
[02:00:25.406 --> 02:00:35.730]  We're talking about Alex Jones and the fact of the matter is that the companies that allow people like him, conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility.
[02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:45.935]  There is no constitutional duty on an internet company to allow somebody to terrorize parents of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[02:00:46.696 --> 02:00:51.760]  The Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him accountable.
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:01:05.150]  But the companies that allow for this nonsense, this garbage, to be spread out over the internet have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the case of InfoWars.
[02:01:05.751 --> 02:01:11.976]  I wish that these parents could shut it all out, but they can't.
[02:01:12.836 --> 02:01:13.377]  They cannot.
[02:01:14.297 --> 02:01:16.680]  He and the media are the ones constantly promoting it.
[02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:17.841]  I barely even ever covered it.
[02:01:18.221 --> 02:01:19.522]  The internet didn't believe a lot of it.
[02:01:19.762 --> 02:01:21.143]  That's our right if people want to do that.
[02:01:21.444 --> 02:01:22.845]  And now they just won't stop.
[02:01:22.945 --> 02:01:24.707]  And it's a synthetic lie.
[02:01:24.927 --> 02:01:30.071]  And then this guy's running a stay-behind group that Obama put in government to shut down the press and Trump.
[02:01:30.432 --> 02:01:32.213]  And he's just a monster.
[02:01:32.573 --> 02:01:34.855]  I mean, he needs to be indicted for being part of this.
[02:01:34.916 --> 02:01:38.399]  And Trump is talking about indicting the co-conspirators, including Schiff.
[02:01:39.153 --> 02:01:39.673]  Oh, precisely.
[02:01:39.713 --> 02:01:56.238]  I mean, the actual coverage of InfoWars, of course, was 90% that Sandy Hook was a real event, and that the only reason, the only questions mostly that were raised were about whether there were second shooters or third shooters, whether or not Big Pharma's role in giving people SSRI drugs, where it was influencing.
[02:01:56.258 --> 02:01:57.298]  Let's be clear, you're the head lawyer.
[02:01:57.338 --> 02:01:59.939]  You've reviewed, you've done thousands of hours.
[02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:00.739]  Absolutely.
[02:02:00.779 --> 02:02:01.960]  So you review everything.
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.941]  Paul Watson, of course, always believed it was a real event.
[02:02:03.961 --> 02:02:05.702]  He's the editor-in-charge here of InfoWars.
[02:02:06.042 --> 02:02:15.488]  So that was always the message from InfoWars, was whether or not the government was being straightforward, whether the government was being clear, whether the government was doing its duty to disclose accurate, honest information.
[02:02:15.848 --> 02:02:21.912]  And of course, ultimately, the Connecticut Supreme Court determined that the law enforcement had hid information that they were not supposed to hide.
[02:02:22.312 --> 02:02:25.974]  And that included the horrifying aspect of this tragedy.
[02:02:26.334 --> 02:02:33.040]  Was that the school system did not give the teachers the means to safeguard the school by giving them the means to lock the doors from the inside.
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:40.767]  That was one of the things that apparently they were trying to cover up by focusing exclusively as the only sole culprit of this incident being a gun.
[02:02:41.127 --> 02:02:42.889]  They didn't want to talk about the role of drugs.
[02:02:42.969 --> 02:02:45.051]  They didn't want to talk about the role of the school system.
[02:02:45.071 --> 02:02:46.953]  They didn't want to talk about the role of law enforcement.
[02:02:47.633 --> 02:02:50.636]  That could have done things different, that could have protected people's lives.
[02:02:51.176 --> 02:03:01.865]  And so as a consequence, you see some of these high-ranking politicians in Connecticut try to demonize you, and try to demonize Infowars, and try to make that the sole source of any particular problem in this particular instance.
[02:03:02.465 --> 02:03:03.306]  And that's what's happening.
[02:03:03.326 --> 02:03:15.516]  And it's not a coincidence that the exact same Senator, Senator Murphy, that's leading this political warfare, and is engaging in supporting the lawfare that's taking place, and using his political connections and ties to help accomplish and achieve that,
[02:03:15.936 --> 02:03:24.481]  And again, our listeners are like, yeah, we know there's censorship.
[02:03:24.782 --> 02:03:25.802]  I understand, folks.
[02:03:26.082 --> 02:03:27.123]  This is the whole enchilada.
[02:03:27.723 --> 02:03:29.725]  This is the one thing Trump hasn't moved on.
[02:03:29.745 --> 02:03:36.028]  And I want to come back with Ben Garrison and you and talk about the next level of deception, where they said they're going to take people off for the comments on their page.
[02:03:36.349 --> 02:03:38.450]  So we're having to prepare legal action just to defend ourselves.
[02:03:38.490 --> 02:03:39.851]  I mean, this is a nightmare situation.
[02:03:39.891 --> 02:03:42.392]  But it's because, as you said, our speech is the truth.
[02:03:42.452 --> 02:03:42.893]  It's winning.
[02:03:44.352 --> 02:03:49.414]  But just briefly, what should the President do in 60 seconds first to stop these people?
[02:03:49.915 --> 02:03:59.839]  So he should do the same thing he did for universities and colleges and say that grants and other federal funding of these various big tech social media giants will not continue unless they support free speech and the First Amendment.
[02:04:00.199 --> 02:04:07.263]  And he should propose legislative changes to Section 230 of the immunity laws that says unless they comply with the First Amendment, they're no longer immune under the law.
[02:04:07.683 --> 02:04:12.265]  And if that could be, those two steps by themselves could reverse the equation in this situation.
[02:04:12.685 --> 02:04:20.751]  And could mean, for example, just yesterday, Unplanned, a very popular movie that's a pro-life movie, Twitter basically took them off and shadow banned them.
[02:04:20.791 --> 02:04:24.054]  They said you can't promote it and you can't spend money and promote it.
[02:04:24.234 --> 02:04:27.696]  Not only that, when people were trying to follow them, they would be unfollowed five seconds later.
[02:04:27.976 --> 02:04:31.359]  So someone would follow the Twitter feed, then it would magically disappear.
[02:04:31.419 --> 02:04:32.600]  It's everybody's speech.
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:33.140]  Absolutely.
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:34.922]  They're not going to stop at Alex Jones.
[02:04:35.122 --> 02:04:38.905]  They're using Alex Jones as the example to stop and suppress independent speech everywhere.
[02:04:40.770 --> 02:04:41.610]  It's like East Germany.
[02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:42.251]  Precisely.
[02:04:42.271 --> 02:04:43.812]  It's very much a Stasi mentality.
[02:04:43.832 --> 02:04:44.972]  It's a Soviet mentality.
[02:04:45.313 --> 02:04:46.774]  That's what the new left believes in.
[02:04:47.194 --> 02:04:48.075]  They believe in control.
[02:04:48.095 --> 02:04:48.935]  They don't believe in freedom.
[02:04:50.376 --> 02:04:52.718]  Pro-life movie unplanned, blocked on Twitter.
[02:04:52.758 --> 02:04:53.538]  Hours after release.
[02:04:53.878 --> 02:04:55.900]  And I think it was Google banned the ads.
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:56.540]  Yeah, pull that up.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:57.561]  We'll talk about that when you come back.
[02:04:58.121 --> 02:05:00.323]  Google banned the... No, we're not taking your money!
[02:05:00.943 --> 02:05:02.064]  Your money's no good here!
[02:05:02.084 --> 02:05:03.885]  Wars.
[02:05:04.626 --> 02:05:05.646]  I mean, I've explained this.
[02:05:05.947 --> 02:05:07.688]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of...
[02:05:08.846 --> 02:05:17.633]  Social media last year saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state and just said I did it.
[02:05:18.935 --> 02:05:25.180]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[02:05:26.632 --> 02:05:43.201]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:05:44.833 --> 02:05:46.956]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[02:05:46.976 --> 02:05:49.479]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:51.461]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[02:05:51.482 --> 02:05:53.784]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[02:05:54.365 --> 02:05:56.568]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:59.472]  All I have is you supporting us.
[02:06:00.553 --> 02:06:01.194]  That's all I have.
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.702]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[02:06:10.483 --> 02:06:11.864]  Because it leads to the future.
[02:06:12.645 --> 02:06:14.947]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:06:16.108 --> 02:06:17.209]  This is not a new world.
[02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:21.633]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:06:22.742 --> 02:06:30.247]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:06:31.167 --> 02:06:38.111]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:06:39.232 --> 02:06:43.855]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:06:44.955 --> 02:06:47.197]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:06:52.554 --> 02:06:54.395]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[02:06:55.275 --> 02:07:00.938]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[02:07:01.938 --> 02:07:05.500]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[02:07:06.701 --> 02:07:11.363]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:53.707]  He'd play the Red River Valley And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry And run his fingers through seventy years of livin' And wonder, Lord, as ever will our drill run dry
[02:07:56.283 --> 02:08:00.865]  We were friends, me and this old man.
[02:08:01.305 --> 02:08:10.649]  Like desperadoes waiting for a train.
[02:08:11.410 --> 02:08:17.813]  Like desperadoes waiting for a train.
[02:08:17.893 --> 02:08:22.455]  Here's a drifter and a driller of oil wells.
[02:08:24.531 --> 02:08:53.092]  And an old school man of the world He let me drive his car when he's too drunk to And he'd wink and give me money for the girls And our lives were like some old western movie Like desperadoes waiting for a train
[02:08:59.662 --> 02:09:02.843]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:09:03.043 --> 02:09:03.463]  to 3 p.m.
[02:09:03.483 --> 02:09:04.123]  we're here live.
[02:09:04.143 --> 02:09:05.503]  David Knight.
[02:09:05.523 --> 02:09:05.663]  8 a.m.
[02:09:05.683 --> 02:09:10.404]  The David Knight Show Central.
[02:09:10.844 --> 02:09:12.225]  Owen Schroer, The War Room.
[02:09:12.245 --> 02:09:13.725]  3 p.m.
[02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.305]  Central.
[02:09:16.606 --> 02:09:18.966]  And they're doing their best to keep us from launching more shows.
[02:09:19.006 --> 02:09:21.087]  I plan to have like 20 hours live by the end of last year.
[02:09:21.127 --> 02:09:22.307]  We couldn't under all the attacks.
[02:09:23.411 --> 02:09:24.832]  And, you know, they fought us to a standstill.
[02:09:24.912 --> 02:09:25.753]  I'll just give you that report.
[02:09:25.773 --> 02:09:26.454]  It'll make them happy.
[02:09:26.574 --> 02:09:29.016]  That's why we need your support, financially, buying the products.
[02:09:29.716 --> 02:09:30.697]  ThemFullWarStore.com.
[02:09:30.717 --> 02:09:35.921]  We're having huge victories in the fight against globalists, but because of that, they're focusing on us to take us out.
[02:09:36.262 --> 02:09:37.282]  This is a war.
[02:09:38.243 --> 02:09:41.726]  They tried to get the president, so now they're focusing on myself and others.
[02:09:42.447 --> 02:09:45.109]  And as we told you, once the censorship is complete with me,
[02:09:47.932 --> 02:09:50.674]  They would then move on to everybody else's speech, and it's all over the news.
[02:09:50.714 --> 02:09:53.456]  TV networks reject ads for anti-abortion movie.
[02:09:53.797 --> 02:09:57.840]  Twitter blocking users from following anti-abortion film in second.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:59.281]  Recent glitch.
[02:09:59.341 --> 02:10:00.582]  Every time they get caught, it's always a glitch.
[02:10:00.962 --> 02:10:02.563]  And we get internal documents that it's not.
[02:10:05.226 --> 02:10:09.809]  And then we also have Wired even admitting that Ben Garrison got false flags.
[02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:13.132]  And I thought of him when this happened to us last week.
[02:10:13.312 --> 02:10:16.174]  He is the most prolific political cartoonist in the world today.
[02:10:16.474 --> 02:10:17.015]  He was already
[02:10:18.447 --> 02:10:26.111]  In the top 20 or so, in mainstream magazines and newspapers, started just doing some basic libertarian stuff, and boy, they attacked him, so he went full-time.
[02:10:27.372 --> 02:10:32.795]  And he is undoubtedly the biggest political cartoonist, if not the biggest cartoonist in the world now.
[02:10:33.795 --> 02:10:35.196]  And so how did they go after him?
[02:10:35.216 --> 02:10:36.437]  Well, they said the alt-right did it.
[02:10:36.737 --> 02:10:37.197]  No, they didn't.
[02:10:37.217 --> 02:10:37.897]  They do this to me.
[02:10:37.998 --> 02:10:40.139]  The leftists, the troll farms, we've infiltrated them.
[02:10:41.072 --> 02:10:48.015]  They started taking his great art, and putting Nazi stuff on it, and the Southern Poverty Law Center and everybody else went along with it and said it was Ben Garrison!
[02:10:48.275 --> 02:10:56.758]  Even though they could go in two minutes, and go to his website, and see that the original art was there, they didn't care.
[02:10:56.858 --> 02:10:58.659]  Well, they've done the same thing to me now.
[02:10:59.419 --> 02:11:08.383]  They're wanting the final Instagram and Facebooks that we never had banned, that were left up, that quote, didn't violate the rules, and a few racist comments, a few anti-Israel, against me!
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:19.282]  And they said, oh yes, if it goes up to 30% of any Semitic in the comments, we'll ban them, wink wink, giving the order for folks to go do it.
[02:11:19.302 --> 02:11:27.925]  And now, I only have two moderators, they're having to sit in there and delete these comments as fast as they come in, because we know it's a false flag.
[02:11:27.945 --> 02:11:35.487]  They're smolleting me, the term that I coined, meaning when you go stage a hate crime against yourself to blame right-wingers, it's called smolleting.
[02:11:36.668 --> 02:11:37.668]  And I'm just a libertarian.
[02:11:38.638 --> 02:11:43.386]  So, leaked emails reveal Facebook's intense internal discussion over Alex Jones' anti-Semitic posts on Instagram.
[02:11:43.406 --> 02:11:51.438]  So, when other people are talking about five anti-Semitic comments out of 560, their own emails came out.
[02:11:52.367 --> 02:12:00.512]  I'm the anti-Semite, and of course it's Jake Cantor, who doesn't want to retract because he wants to get sued, who first reported it and created the whole story.
[02:12:00.532 --> 02:12:05.394]  So we're going to go to Ben Garrison, but just briefly, we're going to ride shotgun on this for a few segments.
[02:12:06.015 --> 02:12:07.936]  Bob Barnes, what do you call this?
[02:12:07.956 --> 02:12:10.437]  I mean, it's clearly a false flag.
[02:12:10.457 --> 02:12:12.158]  I was going to say, it's a new form of false flag.
[02:12:12.438 --> 02:12:29.401]  The new form of false flag is to go on somebody else's page, pretend to be a supporter, and by pretending to be a supporter, say things that violate the terms of service of that particular social media network, and thereby get that person deplatformed, that person's post taken away, that person's ability to post taken away.
[02:12:29.721 --> 02:12:38.022]  And as Facebook admitted, their ultimate objective is to label a person by their name in such a way that their name has to be the person who cannot be named.
[02:12:38.382 --> 02:12:42.083]  That if you even said the words Alex Jones, you could be banned off of social media.
[02:12:42.423 --> 02:12:59.191]  That was their ultimate goal and objective and the entire premise and predicate for it was to get people to basically falsely, to have these trolls, these lefty trolls, pretend to be racist, post racist things, then report their own post and say, holy cow, look at all these racist comments that are on this post.
[02:12:59.211 --> 02:13:03.453]  And we've confirmed it in IP addresses when we do our own comments on the site, which we've gone back to.
[02:13:03.473 --> 02:13:07.315]  We can see the same guys posing as 20 people saying racist things to each other.
[02:13:07.455 --> 02:13:07.675]  Exactly.
[02:13:07.695 --> 02:13:08.937]  They've been doing it for a long time.
[02:13:08.997 --> 02:13:12.501]  Because the troll farm was a leftist invention, not a Russian invention.
[02:13:12.541 --> 02:13:13.962]  And Candace Owens caught them doing it to her.
[02:13:14.182 --> 02:13:14.563]  Exactly.
[02:13:14.583 --> 02:13:15.264]  And they've done it repeatedly.
[02:13:15.284 --> 02:13:17.806]  A lot of people have caught them over the last half decade or so.
[02:13:17.866 --> 02:13:21.831]  It was like feminists going, the Nazis want to get you, but we're going to protect you because she was doing well online.
[02:13:22.171 --> 02:13:23.813]  And then she checked IPs, it was the same people.
[02:13:23.993 --> 02:13:24.454]  Precisely.
[02:13:24.674 --> 02:13:30.380]  They did it to Reddit to take down a whole bunch of sections of Reddit so that those sections disappeared forever from commentary.
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:31.681]  So they've been doing it.
[02:13:31.701 --> 02:13:33.603]  They've done it on Twitter repeatedly and routinely.
[02:13:33.883 --> 02:13:37.587]  For example, they blamed Milo for something that actually wasn't what Milo did.
[02:13:37.607 --> 02:13:40.711]  It was what they did to get Milo banned off of Twitter.
[02:13:41.011 --> 02:13:42.573]  So it's been a consistent pattern.
[02:13:42.613 --> 02:13:43.494]  They know it's happening.
[02:13:43.534 --> 02:13:44.375]  They know it's occurring.
[02:13:44.415 --> 02:13:45.656]  And now I want to go to Ben here.
[02:13:46.477 --> 02:13:51.701]  The left in the streets, I've noticed, has adopted the fraud from the highest levels.
[02:13:52.001 --> 02:13:53.042]  They know it's lies.
[02:13:53.462 --> 02:13:54.443]  They're like an army.
[02:13:54.463 --> 02:13:56.004]  It was like when I was at Lucy's Fried Chicken.
[02:13:56.225 --> 02:13:58.146]  They come to my table three times to threaten me.
[02:13:58.166 --> 02:14:00.608]  And then when I walk out, they threaten me more.
[02:14:01.129 --> 02:14:03.110]  Then they edit the tape and say I attacked them.
[02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:06.393]  But luckily, the restaurant's now gone public.
[02:14:06.493 --> 02:14:07.173]  Alex is welcome.
[02:14:07.193 --> 02:14:08.274]  They started fights three times.
[02:14:08.495 --> 02:14:09.155]  They threw them out.
[02:14:09.395 --> 02:14:10.016]  I was leaving.
[02:14:11.132 --> 02:14:13.594]  But again, hundreds of papers ran with the lie.
[02:14:14.014 --> 02:14:15.295]  Precisely, just like they did at Covington.
[02:14:15.835 --> 02:14:16.956]  It's about edited video.
[02:14:17.216 --> 02:14:22.240]  And with the modern technology, the ability to edit video and to create false narratives and false stories is at an all-new high.
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.322]  And they're just using comment sections now to achieve that and accomplish that.
[02:14:25.342 --> 02:14:26.863]  Ben Garrison, you're with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:14:26.923 --> 02:14:28.004]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:14:28.364 --> 02:14:30.986]  We're going to talk all about this, but what do you call this situation?
[02:14:33.928 --> 02:14:38.551]  Well, it's an attack on people like you and me who
[02:14:39.597 --> 02:14:41.458]  Want to preserve the republic?
[02:14:42.699 --> 02:14:49.723]  We're libertarians, we're conservatives, we're not alt-right, we're not far-right, and we're not Nazis, and we're not anti-semitic.
[02:14:49.803 --> 02:14:54.846]  I mean, that's the narrative that gets foisted upon us.
[02:14:56.347 --> 02:15:03.652]  You know, I've, as you know, I went through years of hell with this because I was an unknown cartoonist.
[02:15:03.732 --> 02:15:04.032]  I mean, I
[02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:12.436]  In 2009, and it's been almost 10 years since I penned my first independent editorial cartoon.
[02:15:12.676 --> 02:15:13.497]  And what did I draw?
[02:15:13.597 --> 02:15:15.859]  It was an anti-Federal Reserve cartoon.
[02:15:16.239 --> 02:15:21.944]  Because I was thinking to myself, well, how come I haven't seen any anti-Federal Reserve cartoons drawn by
[02:15:22.839 --> 02:15:26.442]  You know, conventional liberal cartoonists out there.
[02:15:26.542 --> 02:15:27.442]  I've never seen any.
[02:15:27.563 --> 02:15:28.603]  I want to draw them then.
[02:15:28.723 --> 02:15:31.786]  So I drew them and then I quickly found out why.
[02:15:31.926 --> 02:15:35.608]  Because when you do that, you get attacked fairly quickly.
[02:15:36.609 --> 02:15:45.616]  And by 2010, my work was being routinely defaced and vandalized into anti-Semitic and racist
[02:15:48.267 --> 02:15:52.072]  Stay right there.
[02:15:52.113 --> 02:15:53.775]  Let's talk about this when we come back.
[02:15:53.795 --> 02:15:56.779]  And again, Nazis and people have a right to their free speech.
[02:15:57.319 --> 02:15:59.943]  The point is now the left projects onto us and says we don't have a right.
[02:16:00.363 --> 02:16:01.104]  Everybody has a right.
[02:16:01.124 --> 02:16:02.006]  Remember that in America?
[02:16:05.393 --> 02:16:08.075]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:16:08.415 --> 02:16:14.338]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:16:14.858 --> 02:16:26.865]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:16:30.327 --> 02:16:34.069]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[02:16:35.891 --> 02:16:41.994]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:16:43.935 --> 02:16:49.878]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:16:50.338 --> 02:16:51.759]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:55.321]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[02:17:02.325 --> 02:17:04.306]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:17:04.406 --> 02:17:04.726]  Go ahead.
[02:17:05.748 --> 02:17:07.209]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:17:07.229 --> 02:17:10.310]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:12.211]  It just gets old, man.
[02:17:12.511 --> 02:17:14.231]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:17:14.952 --> 02:17:17.012]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:17:17.252 --> 02:17:21.254]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:17:21.274 --> 02:17:23.695]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:17:24.575 --> 02:17:26.896]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:17:27.256 --> 02:17:28.337]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:17:28.617 --> 02:17:29.497]  Us being shut down?
[02:17:29.737 --> 02:17:30.798]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:17:31.198 --> 02:17:32.258]  You know what, Alex?
[02:17:32.278 --> 02:17:33.399]  Put him on pause again.
[02:17:33.639 --> 02:17:34.219]  Hey, Frank!
[02:17:34.499 --> 02:17:39.841]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:17:40.161 --> 02:17:44.443]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:17:44.663 --> 02:17:47.544]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:17:47.804 --> 02:17:48.185]  You understand?
[02:17:48.265 --> 02:17:49.545]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:17:49.905 --> 02:17:51.026]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:17:52.026 --> 02:17:56.956]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:17:57.918 --> 02:17:58.599]  Do you understand?
[02:17:58.619 --> 02:17:59.801]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:18:02.748 --> 02:18:11.594]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[02:18:12.414 --> 02:18:18.318]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[02:18:18.898 --> 02:18:19.919]  Then they set the precedent.
[02:18:20.399 --> 02:18:24.542]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[02:18:25.262 --> 02:18:26.283]  They take you off the internet.
[02:18:26.723 --> 02:18:36.768]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[02:18:37.528 --> 02:18:42.791]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist
[02:18:43.371 --> 02:18:48.134]  Anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[02:18:48.354 --> 02:18:56.659]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of these big universities, is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[02:18:57.099 --> 02:19:00.621]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[02:19:02.591 --> 02:19:12.479]  Hey, by now I'm sure that most of you know that there are always big discounts and unbelievable savings on a regular basis at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:12.659 --> 02:19:13.740]  But check this out.

[02:20:06.374 --> 02:20:09.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:19.461]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.061 --> 02:20:21.622]  Just a good old boy.
[02:20:23.423 --> 02:20:24.944]  Never meaning no harm.
[02:20:27.665 --> 02:20:32.328]  Be told you never saw them in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[02:20:38.453 --> 02:20:44.381]  That's just a little bit more than it's always about.
[02:20:57.004 --> 02:21:04.266]  I'm going to host some of the next hour when Gerald Salente is on because there's a bunch of breaking news I haven't gotten to.
[02:21:05.086 --> 02:21:11.408]  We also have exclusive video and footage of the Border Patrol delivering illegal aliens to leftist centers.
[02:21:12.408 --> 02:21:15.969]  Now the Border Patrol first told us about this five years ago and we exposed it.
[02:21:16.009 --> 02:21:16.810]  It's happening again.
[02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:21.371]  And that's because there's not enough room at the detention centers.
[02:21:22.785 --> 02:21:25.327]  And under law, once they get across, they can't turn them back.
[02:21:25.347 --> 02:21:26.488]  They'll say, well, Trump just needs to do it.
[02:21:26.868 --> 02:21:27.488]  There's law.
[02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:29.230]  It's got to be changed.
[02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:33.473]  And McAllen said, you know, usually their record number is, what, 3,000?
[02:21:33.513 --> 02:21:34.994]  They're getting about 15,000 a day.
[02:21:35.674 --> 02:21:37.215]  El Paso's record is about 3,000.
[02:21:37.255 --> 02:21:39.217]  They're getting about 15,000 a day.
[02:21:40.137 --> 02:21:43.480]  This has all been initiated by the Democrats and the globalists saying, come to El Norte, it's all free.
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:44.921]  So the border's broken right now.
[02:21:46.162 --> 02:21:49.404]  And the Border Patrol isn't even allowed to take people to be medically checked.
[02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:53.283]  And so they're being trafficked, you name it, that's been confirmed.
[02:21:53.343 --> 02:21:54.884]  That's the start of the next hour.
[02:21:54.924 --> 02:21:58.287]  That is exclusive on Infowars.com.
[02:21:58.888 --> 02:22:00.990]  It was shot by a reporter who was so threatened.
[02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:02.491]  A famous reporter shot this.
[02:22:03.532 --> 02:22:11.179]  A famous reporter gave this to us, who did this on her own, separate from the news network she works for.
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.642]  That's what it's gotten down to in this country.
[02:22:14.628 --> 02:22:17.610]  I'm at liberty to tell you who, but this is getting Twilight Zone.
[02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:19.111]  That's why InfoWars is so important.
[02:22:19.711 --> 02:22:22.173]  We're the place that will put this out, and only you can amplify it.
[02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:34.741]  So getting back to Mr. Garrison here, who of course does the great work over at his website, GRRRGraphics.com, and still at Twitter for now, at Graphics.
[02:22:35.682 --> 02:22:41.125]  Ben, you were getting into the systematic false flagging, but also just the censorship, the shadow banning.
[02:22:42.717 --> 02:22:51.627]  I mean, speak more of your experiences, and of course, attorney at law here, great First Amendment lawyer, one of the top ones in the country, Bob Barnes, to give us your expert take on how we counter this.
[02:22:51.667 --> 02:22:59.035]  Because I keep beating the drum here, folks, that if this is the one thing that could lose 2020, it's the one thing where they're winning, is the censorship.
[02:22:59.215 --> 02:23:00.337]  It's what we've got to focus on.
[02:23:01.064 --> 02:23:01.705]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:23:01.985 --> 02:23:08.991]  And the way they've targeted even cartoonists like Ben, who's sort of innocuous in terms of his graphics.
[02:23:09.251 --> 02:23:11.733]  He's very nice, family-friendly, but very effective.
[02:23:12.013 --> 02:23:12.273]  Correct.
[02:23:12.594 --> 02:23:14.575]  There's nothing bad about it at all.
[02:23:14.615 --> 02:23:16.077]  It's just politically sage.
[02:23:16.477 --> 02:23:22.402]  And it's using an art form that the left had had a large degree of cultural control over, and using it instead
[02:23:22.802 --> 02:23:25.064]  Ben, what do you think of this new level though, where comments on my Instagram
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:52.060]  Comments on the Instagram.
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:55.521]  I'm to blame and they say I'm anti-semitic and they don't tell you till later.
[02:23:55.541 --> 02:24:11.124]  It's for comments I mean, that's that's defamation right there Well, yeah, I mean I tried my best to counter the defamation and copyright infringement Look at first I I did what everybody says you should do is ignore the trolls.
[02:24:11.184 --> 02:24:14.365]  Okay, I ignored the trolls for two years and it got worse and
[02:24:15.198 --> 02:24:20.382]  I came to the conclusion, okay, you don't do anything about the trolling, it's going to get worse.
[02:24:20.422 --> 02:24:23.585]  You do something about it, it's going to get worse.
[02:24:24.065 --> 02:24:41.819]  And by 2014, Facebook had hosted ten pages of impersonators, impersonating me, with all the vandalized cartoons, me calling for murder, murder of African Americans, murder of Jews, blatant, let's kill them, and Facebook would write back,
[02:24:42.501 --> 02:24:44.122]  Doesn't violate our community standards.
[02:24:44.562 --> 02:24:47.244]  And so I had to endure this and all this went on the search engines.
[02:24:47.324 --> 02:24:57.489]  And if anybody typed in that time period, if anybody typed in... Listen, I had you on like five years ago and people were emailing me saying, why are you having that anti-Semite on?
[02:25:00.071 --> 02:25:04.493]  Well, it's one of these things where it's designed to shut you up.
[02:25:05.157 --> 02:25:06.117]  They want you shut up.
[02:25:06.517 --> 02:25:10.418]  And if they can just use these brutal... Look, these people have all the power.
[02:25:10.478 --> 02:25:19.660]  The social media, the Zuckerbergs, and, you know, the Dorsey people, all the Silicon Valley chieftains, they have the power.
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:23.881]  But power is not sufficient evidence of truth.
[02:25:24.181 --> 02:25:24.501]  That's right.
[02:25:24.521 --> 02:25:26.141]  I think people are starting to realize that.
[02:25:26.281 --> 02:25:31.142]  They don't have a lock on the truth, but they pretend they do because they're the authorities.
[02:25:32.074 --> 02:25:39.016]  Anyway, it really destroyed my commercial art career because I was drawing the cartoons on the side for free.
[02:25:39.156 --> 02:25:40.876]  I didn't expect to make money on the cartoons.
[02:25:40.956 --> 02:25:41.897]  I didn't want to make money.
[02:25:41.917 --> 02:25:43.957]  I saw it as my patriotic duty.
[02:25:44.297 --> 02:25:57.641]  I was making money for my commercial art business, which continued to dry up to the point where I could not get a job from any corporation because HR departments are inhabited by SJWs who have nothing to do with anything
[02:25:58.630 --> 02:26:00.952]  You know, anything that is controversial, like me.
[02:26:13.115 --> 02:26:16.958]  of a restaurant this weekend that you said, no, we don't serve you here, get out of here, which is fine.
[02:26:17.258 --> 02:26:24.204]  I wish they'd put a sign on the door saying, we don't support free speech, we don't support conservatives or Christians, then I would, believe me, I do not want to come in your place.
[02:26:25.245 --> 02:26:35.553]  But they are literally getting to this level where now they'll false flag you on the streets when I'm saying, man, like the average leftist now will literally attack you and then say you did it and then giggle about it.
[02:26:35.593 --> 02:26:37.214]  I mean, something happened to the left.
[02:26:38.375 --> 02:26:40.597]  They love war in National Gallup polls now.
[02:26:40.938 --> 02:26:44.961]  The average quote liberal or leftist is pro-war just because Trump's anti-war.
[02:26:45.282 --> 02:26:46.263]  And anti-free speech.
[02:26:46.303 --> 02:26:50.206]  And what you see is it's very much like the 1920s communist style infiltration.
[02:26:50.226 --> 02:27:02.718]  Because what Ben is talking about is that the people who believe in this sort of SJW, social justice warrior, Stasi style mentality of cultural control, who believe in sort of the old Catholic inquisitional mechanism of thought control,
[02:27:03.078 --> 02:27:08.380]  Which is they've gone to human relations departments, the human resources departments, advertising departments.
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:10.041]  They disproportionately control this.
[02:27:10.061 --> 02:27:15.383]  That's why you see a company like Gillette put out an ad that's anti their own customer base and anti men.
[02:27:15.784 --> 02:27:21.466]  It's because the people running their advertising budget and the people running the human resources budget are of the same cultural control.
[02:27:21.486 --> 02:27:22.587]  It's a conscious cult!
[02:27:22.767 --> 02:27:23.327]  It's a cult!
[02:27:23.627 --> 02:27:23.947]  Absolutely.
[02:27:23.967 --> 02:27:24.287]  It's a cult.
[02:27:24.327 --> 02:27:24.707]  It's a cult.
[02:27:24.967 --> 02:27:27.588]  And they're heavily influenced in, of course, education as well.
[02:27:27.628 --> 02:27:31.349]  Both at the public education level, elementary schools, all the way up to public universities.
[02:27:31.749 --> 02:27:36.650]  And so their last bastion of independent thought and freedom that exists out there is the independent free press.
[02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:38.730]  People like Ben and his independent cartoons.
[02:27:39.011 --> 02:27:41.051]  And that's why they target them for harassment.
[02:27:41.071 --> 02:27:49.213]  If they weren't successful, if Ben wasn't successful, if Ben wasn't popular, if he wasn't speaking a deep, deep truth, they wouldn't need to suppress, censor, and shame him the way they have.
[02:27:50.013 --> 02:27:51.794]  Well, I mean, they fear memes.
[02:27:51.834 --> 02:27:53.135]  The EU's trying to ban memes.
[02:27:53.155 --> 02:27:54.255]  That just means ban cartoons.
[02:27:54.756 --> 02:28:04.401]  As long as humans have been here, we've drawn things on the cave walls, we've drawn things in the sand, and then whoever could draw the best were like, well, you're the chief, you know, basically, who could communicate best.
[02:28:04.441 --> 02:28:07.483]  And so what they're saying is, you don't even get to use language.
[02:28:08.271 --> 02:28:09.312]  Think about the power of that.
[02:28:09.332 --> 02:28:12.313]  I want to come back with Ben and ask him about that and how he thinks we fight back.
[02:28:12.333 --> 02:28:14.054]  But I meant to do this and I get so busy.
[02:28:14.234 --> 02:28:15.955]  People can go to his website and buy some of his prints.
[02:28:15.995 --> 02:28:17.096]  We have them all over the office.
[02:28:17.456 --> 02:28:34.686]  Graphics.com and hopefully sometime we're planning to set up or some folks want to work with a site where we have art to actually finance the Liberty Movement because artists that are telling the truth need to be funded because as you heard him, he was a successful guy doing covers of magazines, all that stuff.
[02:28:35.885 --> 02:28:38.647]  And he lost his business because he stood up for America.
[02:28:38.667 --> 02:28:40.728]  And if you look at his work, it's pretty libertarian.
[02:28:40.768 --> 02:28:44.050]  We'll talk to Ben Garrison in one more segment with you as well, Bob Barnes.
[02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:47.433]  And then we are going to do the fourth hour with Gerald Cilente.
[02:28:48.093 --> 02:28:53.197]  And I'm going to do part of it to break a bunch of exclusive news that's up on newswars.com.
[02:28:53.297 --> 02:28:59.781]  Pretty powerful footage to see the Border Patrol acting as Uber to deliver the illegal aliens into the country.
[02:28:59.801 --> 02:29:01.202]  But that's what they have to do by law.
[02:29:03.010 --> 02:29:04.011]  I mean, I've explained this.
[02:29:04.331 --> 02:29:16.043]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of social media last year, saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state, and just said I did it.
[02:29:17.344 --> 02:29:23.611]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[02:29:25.050 --> 02:29:41.605]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:29:43.246 --> 02:29:45.368]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[02:29:45.388 --> 02:29:47.870]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[02:29:48.711 --> 02:29:49.852]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[02:29:49.872 --> 02:29:52.174]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[02:29:52.775 --> 02:29:54.957]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[02:29:56.458 --> 02:29:57.879]  All I have is you supporting us.
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:29:59.581]  That's all I have.
[02:30:02.635 --> 02:30:09.318]  It's been months and months and months since we've been able to have store-wide free shipping at FortWorthStore.com.
[02:30:09.938 --> 02:30:18.923]  And it's been months and months since we were able to offer 50% off on our best-selling products because many of them sold out at the end of the year.
[02:30:19.823 --> 02:30:22.984]  We've gotten almost all of our best-selling products back in stock.
[02:30:23.985 --> 02:30:28.107]  And so now, for the second half of the month of March, we are going to be able to offer
[02:30:29.889 --> 02:30:35.110]  50% off all our best-selling products at FullHorseLife.com, with all the supplements.
[02:30:35.130 --> 02:30:39.732]  And 50% off on many other products on the site as well, and the store-wide free shipping.
[02:30:39.852 --> 02:30:49.034]  And what's even more exciting about this is, as I told you over a year ago, we can no longer get the Deep Earth Crystals to produce the X2 formula.
[02:30:50.097 --> 02:30:56.659]  We're able to get another form of crystals that were just as good, but it still isn't the exact same formula because it's not the exact same type.
[02:30:57.440 --> 02:30:58.260]  That's X3.
[02:30:58.640 --> 02:31:00.261]  All three different types, tri-ionine.
[02:31:00.341 --> 02:31:00.821]  It's excellent.
[02:31:01.001 --> 02:31:01.441]  We have that.
[02:31:01.481 --> 02:31:02.021]  People love it.
[02:31:02.582 --> 02:31:11.745]  But I was able to get the exact same system, the exact same crystals, the exact same formula from the original manufacturer of our ionine.
[02:31:11.985 --> 02:31:15.106]  And we now have the purest, cleanest halogen out there.
[02:31:15.326 --> 02:31:19.468]  The good halogen versus the bad halogens of fluoride and chlorine and all the rest of them.
[02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:40.384]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com now has store-wide free shipping and 50% off Rain Force Plus, 50% off Survival Shield X2, 50% off Super Melo Vitality, 50% off Bodies, 50% off Alpha Power, 50% off Super Blue Products, 50% off DNA Force, 50% off Knockout.
[02:31:41.464 --> 02:31:52.948]  50% off Vitamin Monroe Fusion and then again all the other products are between 40 and 25% off because some of the products don't have 40 or 50% you can cut off because then you're actually losing money.
[02:31:53.468 --> 02:31:57.549]  In fact, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off on the next order.
[02:31:57.949 --> 02:32:00.810]  You can cancel any time for free with one click on your profile.
[02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:02.531]  These become loss leaders, many of them.
[02:32:02.952 --> 02:32:08.542]  And then, oh, I almost forgot, double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[02:32:08.562 --> 02:32:13.311]  So instead of five cents on every dollar, it goes towards your next purchase in your profile account.
[02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:15.811]  It's 10 cents on every dollar.
[02:32:16.091 --> 02:32:24.496]  So you add that to store-wide free shipping, you add that to 50% off, you add that to 10% off on auto ship, and then 10% off credit towards your next order.
[02:32:24.676 --> 02:32:25.676]  That's just insane.
[02:32:25.756 --> 02:32:29.158]  So this is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[02:32:29.238 --> 02:32:38.303]  It matches the sales we did year-end to clear out inventory in case the globals were able to take away our final financial processing systems.
[02:32:38.743 --> 02:32:46.646]  But now we've got backups, thanks to your prayers, thanks to your support, and thanks to the fact this country still has basic redundancy against the tyrants.
[02:32:46.966 --> 02:32:52.828]  But we are fighting for our very existence, so help fund the tip of the spear and get great products at the same time.
[02:32:52.908 --> 02:32:54.189]  A $3.60 win at infowarestore.com.

[02:33:06.423 --> 02:33:09.144]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.705 --> 02:33:16.445]  Big Brother.
[02:33:16.865 --> 02:33:18.105]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:18.646 --> 02:33:19.746]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:20.546 --> 02:33:21.986]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:22.246 --> 02:33:23.427]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:23.907 --> 02:33:28.408]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.222 --> 02:33:37.343]  Ben Garrison's our guest.
[02:33:37.683 --> 02:33:38.443]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.723 --> 02:33:44.945]  Please don't forget, without you supporting us, getting books, getting t-shirts, we sell some of Ben's stuff, his book, got a new one coming out.
[02:33:45.645 --> 02:33:49.186]  Without you buying products at Inforestore.com, we cannot continue this operation.
[02:33:49.646 --> 02:33:51.107]  And you may know all about the New World Order.
[02:33:52.267 --> 02:33:53.947]  It's about how we're going to reach new people.
[02:33:54.147 --> 02:34:01.710]  And we have the very best supplements, the very best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the very best storable foods, the very best air filtration and water filtration systems.
[02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:02.790]  Whatever the best is,
[02:34:04.747 --> 02:34:07.688]  I go out, I make a deal, and then I sell it to you at a low price.
[02:34:07.808 --> 02:34:09.728]  And folks, X2 will change your life.
[02:34:09.768 --> 02:34:11.049]  We thought we couldn't get more of it.
[02:34:11.869 --> 02:34:20.011]  Deep Earth Crystal Pure Iodine in the organic oil, plant oil, that is so incredible for your body.
[02:34:20.231 --> 02:34:20.991]  The Missing Link.
[02:34:21.291 --> 02:34:22.951]  When I forget to take it, I totally feel it.

[02:34:25.112 --> 02:34:26.312]  98% reviews.
[02:34:26.392 --> 02:34:29.073]  Go read the thousands and thousands of reviews.
[02:34:29.433 --> 02:34:30.393]  Five-star reviews.

[02:34:32.233 --> 02:34:34.234]  Energy, stamina, focus their whole life.

[02:34:40.381 --> 02:34:47.208]  Triple 8 to 533139 in fours live dot com takes you right to the supplements in four store dot com is the umbrella site.
[02:34:47.548 --> 02:34:48.850]  It's all there 50 to 60% off.
[02:34:50.031 --> 02:34:53.834]  Storewide, free shipping storewide, double Patriot points without your purchases.
[02:34:54.214 --> 02:34:56.275]  We are unable to carry this out.
[02:34:56.776 --> 02:35:19.451]  So, so Ben, I've been asking a lot of questions, but I wanted, and I want Bob, this segment, he's still with us to ask any questions he's got or statements, but other points you'd like to make about this censorship, because I know that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, they all got everybody in the last 20 years with their own websites and their own businesses and their own billboards to point them there to their Facebook and YouTube pages.
[02:35:20.748 --> 02:35:23.250]  On Twitter pages, people believing it was theirs.
[02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:33.638]  And Twitter left it out there and let the most outrageous stuff go on forever, but now they're just cracking down and saying, you can't say, learn to code.
[02:35:33.699 --> 02:35:41.445]  There's an article up on Infowars.com, the top story right now, where people are coming out saying, what is this?
[02:35:41.505 --> 02:35:45.708]  I mean, the language policing is like beyond the worst university you've ever seen.
[02:35:46.509 --> 02:35:47.750]  Where do you think this is all going?
[02:35:49.705 --> 02:35:51.546]  It's not going to a good place, Alex.
[02:35:53.086 --> 02:36:17.534]  We see what's going on in China with their social credit system, and we already have that in the beginnings of that here, where if you're a conservative and you want to speak up and preserve the republic, which we're a republic now in form rather than substance, because we let a big bureaucratic authoritarian oligarchy take over.
[02:36:19.413 --> 02:36:40.582]  But now, if you have a low social credit, now if you're just Christian, or white, or male, it seems like, or heterosexual, but if you violate what they see as their guidelines of free speech, you could have PayPal pull the plug on you.
[02:36:41.063 --> 02:36:43.984]  Some people are experiencing that they can't do any banking.
[02:36:44.944 --> 02:36:49.865]  So, you know, as much as I detest Nazis, I still think they have a right of free speech.
[02:36:50.086 --> 02:36:55.187]  And the ACLU actually used to defend Nazis and give them the right to speak out in March.
[02:36:55.647 --> 02:37:05.450]  But now they just go ahead and try to get... And if you have unpopular speech, unpopular to the SJW crowd, they go after your employment.
[02:37:05.490 --> 02:37:06.290]  They did that to me.
[02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:11.252]  I had somebody write me and say, I'm not going to rest until you're fired and out on the streets.
[02:37:11.292 --> 02:37:12.652]  He didn't know I was self-employed.
[02:37:13.368 --> 02:37:15.471]  But in effect, my business was compromised.
[02:37:15.571 --> 02:37:20.677]  And in fact, I got kicked out of the art gallery I was in up here because all the trolls ganged up on the art gallery.
[02:37:20.697 --> 02:37:22.820]  Oh, we've lost five of our six bank accounts.
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:24.021]  They don't want you to make money.
[02:37:24.361 --> 02:37:28.807]  And if we had no supporters, and that's what we turned it around.
[02:37:28.827 --> 02:37:29.788]  We turned it around around 2016.
[02:37:32.023 --> 02:37:38.248]  And Tina just said, my wife Tina says, I'm going to get on social media and I'm going to spread those cartoons better than the trolls are.
[02:37:38.308 --> 02:37:38.808]  And she did.
[02:37:38.869 --> 02:37:44.993]  She made it her full time job and she worked long hours to so that I could regain my own voice.
[02:37:45.434 --> 02:37:50.218]  But we could not have had the success we've had recently without help from supporters.
[02:37:50.998 --> 02:37:55.041]  And as reluctant as I was to rattle a tin cup around, I said, yeah, I can't do it.
[02:37:55.241 --> 02:37:56.262]  I can't do it by myself.
[02:37:56.342 --> 02:37:58.224]  I won't be able to draw the cartoons without help.
[02:37:59.073 --> 02:38:08.482]  Unfortunately, we've had a lot of people who like my cartoons keep us afloat, and now we have a book coming out this summer to mark the 10-year anniversary.
[02:38:08.522 --> 02:38:10.884]  It's called Ben's Big Book of Editorial Cartoons.
[02:38:11.404 --> 02:38:12.505]  I want to order a bunch.
[02:38:12.766 --> 02:38:21.394]  I want to order a bunch, so I'm going to get you on the line with my order, folks, because I want to be selling them at InfoWarsStore.com, and I can't wait to put one on my coffee table because you're
[02:38:22.174 --> 02:38:24.936]  They're pro-family, they're pro-America, they're family-friendly.
[02:38:25.296 --> 02:38:27.738]  I think churches ought to have these.
[02:38:28.338 --> 02:38:31.500]  People have the money, you should buy two copies and donate one to the library.
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:35.182]  Because people, understand, a book like that's going to get checked out hundreds of times.
[02:38:35.562 --> 02:38:38.064]  And a book like that will wake up young people as well.
[02:38:38.624 --> 02:38:43.768]  I love your cartoons because they're timeless, they're evergreen, and they're good for adults and children.
[02:38:45.849 --> 02:38:46.349]  Well, thank you.
[02:38:49.505 --> 02:38:52.546]  Like I said, though, I wouldn't be here without the supporters.
[02:38:52.586 --> 02:38:57.609]  I just wouldn't be because I have spent the last of our savings in 2014 on a book.
[02:38:58.369 --> 02:39:02.672]  And the book was designed to prove to the world that I wasn't a racist, anti-Semitic Nazi.
[02:39:03.490 --> 02:39:04.311]  And the book flopped.
[02:39:04.371 --> 02:39:06.134]  And after that, I was ready to throw in the towel.
[02:39:06.154 --> 02:39:15.026]  I said, these cartoons cost me nothing but grief and cost me so much money and it cost me my sanity almost because I was walking around white hot mad all the time.
[02:39:15.226 --> 02:39:20.934]  Sure, but Ben, isn't it fair to say that it made you an even better cartoonist and that you are now more successful than you've ever been?
[02:39:22.136 --> 02:39:22.656]  Yes, it did.
[02:39:22.696 --> 02:39:23.237]  But you know what?
[02:39:23.457 --> 02:39:26.800]  Now I look back at it and I can't imagine why I got so angry.
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:28.841]  Now I'm able to laugh at the trolls.
[02:39:28.901 --> 02:39:34.726]  And when I see places like 4chan that still deface my cartoons once in a while, I even laugh at those.
[02:39:35.046 --> 02:39:36.507]  It just doesn't bother me anymore.
[02:39:36.547 --> 02:39:39.309]  Maybe I just got so calloused by the experience.
[02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:42.011]  Well, you also had Main Street Media claiming that that was your cartoons.
[02:39:42.231 --> 02:39:44.353]  So they've had to back off now that you've fought back.
[02:39:44.953 --> 02:39:45.174]  Bob?
[02:39:47.399 --> 02:39:53.183]  What will people, if we defeat this censorship, what will they call this period that we're alive in right now?
[02:39:53.203 --> 02:39:55.885]  Well, it's sort of its own form of Dark Ages, potentially.
[02:39:55.965 --> 02:40:01.389]  In other words, it's very much a transitional time period where either freedom is going to succeed or authoritarianism is going to succeed.
[02:40:01.929 --> 02:40:04.710]  And you're seeing it at a broad scale and in multiple contexts.
[02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:22.394]  So you have a big tech engines that are trying to build a Chinese model, who really think the Chinese were probably going to dominate in 20, 20, 30 years, and who are building their big tech model for a social media control, censorship and shaming strategies, the social credit attributes that Ben is talking about, that was going to be worldwide and global.
[02:40:22.854 --> 02:40:27.275]  And it's fighting back against the Chinese model for the future of the United States and the future of the world.
[02:40:27.315 --> 02:40:30.436]  And so this is the key transitional time period where either they win or we win.
[02:40:30.876 --> 02:40:45.074]  And that's why they're doubling down, that's why they're intensifying their attacks, that's why they're going after InfoWars and you in particular, because they need to be able to destabilize and shut down the independent free press in the country that is their true threat to their authoritarian objectives.
[02:40:45.215 --> 02:40:47.738]  Is the left, if they get defeated, are going to be known like...
[02:40:47.958 --> 02:40:49.979]  Real Nazis, like embarrassed they were ever Nazis.
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:54.402]  Because again, the average leftist, when you talk, they go, yeah, we know we're making it up.
[02:40:54.723 --> 02:40:56.023]  We're going to get you and kill you.
[02:40:56.364 --> 02:41:02.528]  I mean, they've converted the average leftist to consciously knowing it's all a fraud, loving the Jesse Smollett stage stuff.
[02:41:02.608 --> 02:41:03.488]  Maddie got caught.
[02:41:04.189 --> 02:41:09.793]  Now, there's still bleeding heart liberals that mean well, but a lot of them have now converted to, no, we're the ruling class.
[02:41:10.373 --> 02:41:13.175]  Exactly, and they want control of thought, control of ideas, control of speech.
[02:41:13.555 --> 02:41:24.281]  And when you listen to what Ben is talking about, where the social credit system is labeling people, and labeling people in such a way that they can't get employment, can't have successful mechanisms, really it's the old Nazi numbering system.
[02:41:24.301 --> 02:41:26.403]  They're just putting numbers on people inside of their arms.
[02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:27.583]  Incredible discrimination.
[02:41:27.963 --> 02:41:28.384]  Precisely.
[02:41:28.564 --> 02:41:33.907]  But you know, in law, don't we really have laws against discrimination against people's politics?
[02:41:34.427 --> 02:41:36.949]  Because, you know, they say we don't, but I mean, isn't there mechanisms?
[02:41:37.569 --> 02:41:43.835]  There should be, and there's supposed to be, and there's some laws that on paper protect us, but unfortunately the courts have too frequently and too often been closed to it.
[02:41:44.155 --> 02:41:56.446]  So we have, because of the way the lawfare system has worked, too much of the judicial branch shares the same ideological approach as the left, and that's causing hindrances in being able to achieve a positive outcome through the court system.
[02:41:56.746 --> 02:42:00.810]  So it's going to create political pressure in the court of public opinion to make sure the law reflects what it should be.
[02:42:00.990 --> 02:42:02.091]  I'll explain how bad it is.
[02:42:03.152 --> 02:42:04.573]  This weekend I went into a restaurant.
[02:42:06.593 --> 02:42:11.978]  Slash bar, nice little place, looked nice, with my wife and Rob Dew.
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:17.324]  And we were there, and some of the patrons came over and said, oh, you're Alex Jones!
[02:42:17.964 --> 02:42:21.648]  And I shook their hand and everything, and they were Beto supporters, and I said, that's fine.
[02:42:22.729 --> 02:42:26.512]  And then the manager comes over and says, I want you to leave.
[02:42:27.597 --> 02:42:27.797]  Absolutely.
[02:42:27.817 --> 02:42:29.119]  They literally want to put effectively
[02:42:43.576 --> 02:42:50.058]  Numbers on people's arms to control whether they have access to the banking system, social media, the ability to express speech, the ability to have dinner out.
[02:42:50.658 --> 02:42:51.819]  That's the effect of what they're doing.
[02:42:51.899 --> 02:42:52.879]  Of course, you've had dinner with me.
[02:42:53.119 --> 02:42:54.059]  Most folks are big fans.
[02:42:54.159 --> 02:42:54.699]  Oh, of course.
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:58.020]  But still, these little isolated pockets just put a sign on your door that we're not welcome.
[02:42:58.040 --> 02:42:59.161]  We want you to go bankrupt.
[02:42:59.221 --> 02:43:02.502]  We hate you.
[02:43:03.702 --> 02:43:05.063]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:43:05.123 --> 02:43:06.903]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:07.443]  It is.
[02:43:07.623 --> 02:43:09.204]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[02:43:10.476 --> 02:43:12.037]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[02:43:12.517 --> 02:43:13.758]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:43:13.858 --> 02:43:15.598]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:43:15.678 --> 02:43:17.999]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:43:18.159 --> 02:43:19.720]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:21.181]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:43:21.241 --> 02:43:22.461]  You've got the children's.
[02:43:22.621 --> 02:43:23.602]  You've got the adults.
[02:43:23.722 --> 02:43:24.622]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:43:24.742 --> 02:43:26.783]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the
[02:43:26.843 --> 02:43:28.084]  Children's are really strong.
[02:43:28.104 --> 02:43:31.906]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:43:32.046 --> 02:43:32.727]  And I'm just sorry.
[02:43:32.807 --> 02:43:33.848]  You want something like this?
[02:43:33.908 --> 02:43:34.768]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:43:34.888 --> 02:43:36.749]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:43:36.810 --> 02:43:37.950]  It's so good, in my view.
[02:43:38.030 --> 02:43:40.232]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:43:40.372 --> 02:43:42.973]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:43:43.054 --> 02:43:44.695]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:43:46.456 --> 02:43:51.019]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:43:53.973 --> 02:43:59.947]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:44:00.007 --> 02:44:00.728]  I just can't do it!
[02:44:05.475 --> 02:44:08.797]  Just please remember, if you want to keep hearing this show on air, pray for us.
[02:44:08.817 --> 02:44:09.997]  We're praying for you.
[02:44:10.177 --> 02:44:11.678]  And please don't forget, store-wide free shipping.
[02:44:11.818 --> 02:44:14.559]  And the biggest sale ever, 50% to 60% off on all the supplements.
[02:44:14.639 --> 02:44:15.680]  But it's got to end.
[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:25.725]  There's a bunch of things like the fish oil, and even X2, and even X3, and bodies, and the bone broth, and Turbo Force, and Brain Force, and Super Silver Wound Gel are all very close to selling out.
[02:44:25.765 --> 02:44:26.685]  So those will be pulled soon.
[02:44:27.005 --> 02:44:28.146]  50% to 60% off all the items.
[02:44:28.206 --> 02:44:29.547]  But infowarestore.com.
[02:44:29.647 --> 02:44:32.288]  Let's make no mistake, we're not up here puffing our importance.
[02:44:32.788 --> 02:44:36.429]  We're just folks ready to resist these people, and of course, it's paying off.
[02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:37.189]  Folks want freedom.
[02:44:37.549 --> 02:44:39.770]  But this, we're in the center of a war now.
[02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:50.052]  For a pro-human future, or an anti-human future, but whatever you do, however you're listening, on satellite, on TV, on radio, at infowars.com forward slash show, tell other people about it.
[02:44:50.372 --> 02:45:00.474]  That's what breaks the back of big tech, is your human intelligence, your human action, your will, your word of mouth is unstoppable, and we salute you.
[02:45:02.645 --> 02:45:08.568]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.

[02:45:15.271 --> 02:45:17.772]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[02:45:17.992 --> 02:45:21.414]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[02:45:21.714 --> 02:45:27.917]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[02:45:28.177 --> 02:45:34.220]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:41.743]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.

[02:47:06.284 --> 02:47:10.409]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:20.481]  You found it!
[02:47:20.781 --> 02:47:24.185]  The number one most demonized attack lied about broadcast in the world.
[02:47:24.245 --> 02:47:25.607]  It's where a platform for everybody.
[02:47:26.288 --> 02:47:28.329]  You'll be able to stand up and tell the truth and speak out.
[02:47:28.349 --> 02:47:31.389]  A bunch of exclusives I'm going to cover in the first two segments of the next hour.
[02:47:31.509 --> 02:47:33.850]  One of them is on M4Wars.com.
[02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:35.250]  M4Wars exclusive video.
[02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:38.351]  Border Patrol being used as illegal immigrant Uber service.
[02:47:39.211 --> 02:47:43.332]  And then some of the folks from, well, not the Border Patrol, but some of the folks at the quote, Christian Church.
[02:47:44.633 --> 02:47:45.993]  They say, you don't show these people.
[02:47:47.233 --> 02:47:49.054]  The smugglers might come after them.
[02:47:49.974 --> 02:47:52.075]  Wait a minute, they're being smuggled in.
[02:47:52.095 --> 02:47:53.435]  They paid smugglers to get here.
[02:47:55.063 --> 02:47:57.585]  It's on newswars.com as well.
[02:47:58.085 --> 02:48:01.688]  And again, TV networks rejecting ads for anti-abortion movies that are G-rated.
[02:48:02.549 --> 02:48:03.449]  Twitter blocking it.
[02:48:04.530 --> 02:48:10.234]  Mainline MD doctors with Facebooks about vaccine damage and the fact that vaccines can really hurt you.
[02:48:10.875 --> 02:48:11.675]  The inserts say it.
[02:48:11.715 --> 02:48:12.576]  They're all being banned.
[02:48:13.177 --> 02:48:16.499]  So you can see how this has gone into total overdrive.
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:24.005]  Then they use me as a straw man and lie about what I've said and done, but to make the whole debate about me
[02:48:25.683 --> 02:48:47.158]  And in the process, I just get more and more and more and more famous, but in this crazy world where what I actually say has trouble getting out, it gets out on these local radio stations, it gets out at Infowars.com, but the average person is so habituated to Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, they go, man, I used to love your show, used to watch it every day on YouTube, used to watch it every day on iTunes, or listen, Shad, your show's off the air!
[02:48:47.999 --> 02:48:51.382]  They believe mainstream, and I go, I'm on the air every day, Infowars.com.
[02:48:52.324 --> 02:48:53.945]  So Alex Jones isn't dead.
[02:48:54.345 --> 02:48:55.546]  The free press isn't dead.
[02:48:55.866 --> 02:48:57.187]  Free speech isn't a crime.
[02:48:57.727 --> 02:49:02.450]  And that's why those of you that are smart enough to know the show's still on the air have to keep spreading the word.
[02:49:02.690 --> 02:49:04.992]  In ways, the hardcore audience has gotten bigger.
[02:49:05.572 --> 02:49:08.634]  And Congress, the military's listening, and people all over the world are listening.
[02:49:08.654 --> 02:49:10.215]  People know this is a verboten program.
[02:49:10.715 --> 02:49:17.219]  But to the general public that kind of just thinks of things as channels, they get habituated to the channel they go to.
[02:49:17.239 --> 02:49:21.862]  And when they don't hear it there anymore, on like iHeartRadio or wherever, we're taking it on everywhere.
[02:49:23.166 --> 02:49:25.709]  Cause you know, that's the move, that's what you do, yeah!
[02:49:26.169 --> 02:49:27.571]  He's getting banned, we're gonna do it too.
[02:49:27.591 --> 02:49:29.813]  And you're like, wow, that's iHeartRadio, that's Clear Channel.
[02:49:31.795 --> 02:49:33.297]  There's leftists in everywhere.
[02:49:33.377 --> 02:49:40.224]  Fox News, I'm told by high-level Fox hosts, the biggest there are, that Alex, you don't understand, 80% of the staff are leftists.
[02:49:42.467 --> 02:49:43.407]  They've taken over.
[02:49:44.448 --> 02:49:54.313]  It's just what he was saying earlier, Bob Barnes, is they get in key positions like they did with Ben Garrison to block him out of business when he started doing his own private...
[02:49:56.045 --> 02:49:57.325]  So again, it's right.
[02:49:57.385 --> 02:50:06.907]  It's the direct patronage of people like you to go to Graphics.com and get a poster or to go to Infomercial.com and get a book.
[02:50:07.227 --> 02:50:08.827]  That's how this is happening.
[02:50:09.447 --> 02:50:11.788]  And it's nip and tuck for us, I can tell you.
[02:50:12.208 --> 02:50:14.888]  So in closing, Ben, I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:50:15.548 --> 02:50:19.589]  And it was great when you came to Austin and hung out with us and Sabo.
[02:50:20.669 --> 02:50:22.450]  And I do want to do some exciting things in the future.
[02:50:22.470 --> 02:50:23.990]  I do want to carry your new book when it comes out.
[02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:38.737]  Again, getting back to Trump, I like a lot of what he's doing, but hopefully you can do a cartoon, if you think of a good way to do it, where he's handling all this other stuff great, but he's leaving this one area open of the censorship.
[02:50:41.299 --> 02:50:44.300]  Well, you know, I support Trump not because he's perfect.
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:45.221]  He's not perfect.
[02:50:45.821 --> 02:50:49.903]  I support him because he might be our last, best hope to turn things around.
[02:50:49.923 --> 02:50:54.186]  I mean, I would like to see him do a lot more.
[02:50:55.549 --> 02:50:57.669]  Let's pardon Assange.
[02:50:57.729 --> 02:51:01.850]  Let's overturn the Patriot Act along with Obamacare.
[02:51:01.890 --> 02:51:06.071]  I mean, he could do a lot more than he's done, but the cornerstone is the wall.
[02:51:06.091 --> 02:51:07.131]  We have to have the wall.
[02:51:07.891 --> 02:51:10.092]  I mean, I was watching Bill Marley the other night.
[02:51:10.132 --> 02:51:13.532]  Bill Marley says, oh, these are just kind people who want to come up here and pick our lettuce.
[02:51:13.572 --> 02:51:14.252]  What's wrong with that?
[02:51:14.292 --> 02:51:20.874]  Well, they also, I read a statistic that they cost the country a hundred and, I think it was 115 billion per year
[02:51:23.735 --> 02:51:26.456]  In social costs and prisons and everything else.
[02:51:26.716 --> 02:51:28.617]  So they're coming up here to get free stuff.
[02:51:28.657 --> 02:51:30.257]  They're coming up here so they can vote.
[02:51:30.837 --> 02:51:32.398]  Take away our guns and our liberties.
[02:51:32.918 --> 02:51:33.238]  Oh yeah.
[02:51:33.958 --> 02:51:35.099]  It boils down to this.
[02:51:35.319 --> 02:51:36.939]  They're calling us extremists now.
[02:51:37.259 --> 02:51:38.600]  I get called extremists all the time.
[02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:41.321]  I lost a lot of my liberal friends because they think I'm mean.
[02:51:42.101 --> 02:51:44.082]  Because I don't want to allow all these people in here.
[02:51:44.242 --> 02:51:46.322]  And somehow that makes me a hater.
[02:51:47.043 --> 02:51:49.623]  And they don't even know that Latin America has collapsed.
[02:51:49.683 --> 02:51:51.184]  They don't understand how deadly dangerous this is.
[02:51:53.325 --> 02:52:00.266]  Well, my thing is, I like that quote by Goldwater, he said, extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:52:01.067 --> 02:52:04.387]  So I'm going to stay as, I'll be an extremist in the defense of liberty.
[02:52:04.867 --> 02:52:13.869]  But the thing that, here's what it boils down to, Alex, is my old liberal friends see the world, they see themselves as good people.
[02:52:14.429 --> 02:52:15.710]  They're doing good in the world.
[02:52:15.790 --> 02:52:17.030]  They want government.
[02:52:17.805 --> 02:52:23.749]  To go out and do their bidding, which is to solve the world's problem and bring about a utopia.
[02:52:24.870 --> 02:52:27.851]  But this Star Trek-like utopia can't happen.
[02:52:27.891 --> 02:52:32.134]  Instead, what they deliver is a Mad Max dystopian world.
[02:52:32.614 --> 02:52:43.962]  And that's where we're heading if we continue to let these egalitarian strains of, let's get, the government is wise, they're intelligent, they're so helpful, they love us and they want to help people, no.
[02:52:44.930 --> 02:52:54.299]  We conservatives see government as something dangerous, something that tends to keep growing and get more corrupt, and they steal from the hard-working man.
[02:52:56.041 --> 02:52:58.023]  Government doesn't produce anything, they just take.
[02:52:58.800 --> 02:53:08.848]  So that is what I want to try to do with my cartoons, is to try to get people to realize that, hey, government has gotten so big and out of control.
[02:53:09.248 --> 02:53:12.831]  And my next big worry is going to be mandatory vaccines.
[02:53:12.891 --> 02:53:19.877]  And if they can control your health, which they already do to a large degree, I mean, they got the fluoride in the water and you breathe the chemtrails and they
[02:53:21.073 --> 02:53:33.284]  I guess they call it global engineering now, but if they can inject mercury and aluminum directly into your brain and then simultaneously make sure that you can't sell raw milk, well, it's over.
[02:53:34.185 --> 02:53:37.408]  We have to make sure that we have control over our own bodies.
[02:53:38.068 --> 02:53:43.153]  And so I'm going to draw more cartoons that have to do with this vaccination abuse that we see.
[02:53:44.116 --> 02:53:50.901]  So that's my line of the sand, and to take your paraphrase, government is not reason, it is not eloquence.
[02:53:51.381 --> 02:53:54.824]  It is force, like fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[02:53:55.024 --> 02:53:58.787]  Never, for a moment, should it be left to irresponsible action.
[02:54:00.186 --> 02:54:05.191]  Founding Fathers knew this very well, and that's why you don't see the word democracy in our Constitution.
[02:54:05.491 --> 02:54:10.095]  And yet, when you turn on the news, that's all you hear from these commentators is, our democracy, our democracy.
[02:54:10.655 --> 02:54:13.478]  They're really saying, our socialism, our socialism, our socialism.
[02:54:14.939 --> 02:54:17.902]  That's what they're driving hard to the hoop to bring about, is socialism.
[02:54:18.502 --> 02:54:24.427]  And, you know, I'm going to draw all the cartoons I can to speak out in socialism in all its forms.
[02:54:24.447 --> 02:54:25.949]  There is no good form of socialism.
[02:54:26.835 --> 02:54:28.776]  Sweden is not a socialist country.
[02:54:28.836 --> 02:54:30.016]  It's a heavily taxed country.
[02:54:30.036 --> 02:54:31.637]  But they say, well, let's be like Sweden.
[02:54:31.677 --> 02:54:32.377]  They're socialists.
[02:54:32.417 --> 02:54:33.498]  Why can't we be socialists?
[02:54:33.518 --> 02:54:35.198]  And they're going to collapse within a few years.
[02:54:36.459 --> 02:54:36.819]  It will.
[02:54:36.839 --> 02:54:43.482]  It always, it always leads to, it ends up leading to murder and death and death of millions.
[02:54:43.502 --> 02:54:45.242]  It always leads to lazy people.
[02:54:45.583 --> 02:54:46.083]  A century.
[02:54:47.323 --> 02:54:48.384]  Ben, you are awesome.
[02:54:48.404 --> 02:54:49.044]  God bless you.
[02:54:49.084 --> 02:54:49.644]  Let's talk.
[02:54:49.664 --> 02:54:51.185]  I'm going to get Tim or one of the crew to call you.
[02:54:51.205 --> 02:54:54.326]  I want to order a whole bunch of that big book because I liked your other book we sold.
[02:54:54.606 --> 02:54:55.967]  But I said, like a year ago,
[02:54:56.943 --> 02:54:59.364]  You want to put on a big coffee table, and you said, I'm doing just that.
[02:54:59.784 --> 02:55:01.145]  So is this new book a big old book?
[02:55:02.685 --> 02:55:08.087]  It's going to be 9 by 12, and we've already upgraded it to hardcover and thicker, glossy.
[02:55:08.127 --> 02:55:10.548]  Because we keep people keep pre-ordering the book.
[02:55:10.828 --> 02:55:11.889]  It's on Indiegogo.
[02:55:12.749 --> 02:55:15.550]  I mean, I couldn't afford to print out a book that cost that much.
[02:55:15.570 --> 02:55:16.591]  Now there's so much interest.
[02:55:16.611 --> 02:55:21.233]  Well, that's why I was saying earlier, I never got around to it, that I could finance you doing it, because I want you to be able to print 50,000 of these.
[02:55:21.493 --> 02:55:22.593]  We're going to talk soon, Ben.
[02:55:22.633 --> 02:55:24.554]  God bless you, and take care, my friend.
[02:55:25.336 --> 02:55:25.856]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:55:50.256 --> 02:55:56.822]  So you can get his 2016 presidential election collection by Ben Garrison at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:55:58.403 --> 02:55:59.864]  But I can't wait till his new one comes out.
[02:55:59.884 --> 02:56:02.947]  I want to push that heavily because I really pushed him to put out a big coffee table book.
[02:56:04.328 --> 02:56:11.774]  Like so many people like Mark Dyson, they don't even have the money to do a 10,000 print with a publisher or to go out to a printer.
[02:56:11.814 --> 02:56:15.938]  They just do it where it's print on demand and then the artist gets almost nothing.
[02:56:17.003 --> 02:56:21.124]  So, but I'm glad that he's got enough pre-orders to be able to even upgrade the quality, see?
[02:56:22.244 --> 02:56:24.765]  As people pre-ordered it, he's even able to upgrade the quality.
[02:56:24.805 --> 02:56:25.785]  That's how this works, Shish.
[02:56:27.246 --> 02:56:28.006]  It's like a plant.
[02:56:28.066 --> 02:56:33.727]  You put water on it, you give it, you know, give it oxygen, you give it carbon dioxide, you give it sunlight, it lives.
[02:56:33.767 --> 02:56:34.507]  You don't, it dies.
[02:56:34.547 --> 02:56:35.448]  That's why I tell the listeners.
[02:56:38.088 --> 02:56:39.669]  Over the years, I've maybe plugged once an hour.
[02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:41.009]  Notice I'm plugging like twice an hour.
[02:56:42.729 --> 02:56:46.883]  And that's because we need the funding in the face of all these lawsuits.
[02:56:49.551 --> 02:57:05.061]  Two lawsuits thrown out last week, the one in Cleveland over the flag burning, where we got blamed for stuff we didn't do, and I'm not going to get into it all, but the point is that we had folks covering a flag burning, and then a bunch of melee happened, and we were obviously not for burning the flag, and it just went sideways.
[02:57:05.081 --> 02:57:11.466]  But that all got dropped, and then half the suit in Virginia got cut out, and then the next phase, hopefully the rest will get cut out, but that's how those things work.
[02:57:12.006 --> 02:57:17.029]  But you don't hear that we've had 16 lawsuits thrown out in a year and a half at the cost of $3 million.
[02:57:18.090 --> 02:57:19.091]  Yeah, $3 million.
[02:57:19.712 --> 02:57:20.393]  You don't hear that.
[02:57:21.134 --> 02:57:25.719]  You hear that, oh, Alex Jones is, you know, losing, he's going under.
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:27.241]  They want to make us losers.
[02:57:27.742 --> 02:57:28.583]  They want to have wins.
[02:57:29.604 --> 02:57:32.127]  That's $3 million, not $3 million of product sold.
[02:57:32.848 --> 02:57:34.770]  $3 million of product is like a million and a half dollars.
[02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:36.552]  Then you've got to spend that to run the operation.
[02:57:37.453 --> 02:57:40.414]  $3 million is $3 million money we lost to not be able to expand.
[02:57:40.454 --> 02:57:43.196]  We didn't go 24 hours a day last year because of that.
[02:57:43.656 --> 02:57:51.840]  I want the money in here to go to the next level, so please get a t-shirt, get a book, sign up for AutoShip so we can do it and rub it in the face of these people.
[02:57:54.741 --> 02:57:55.741]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[02:57:55.981 --> 02:57:57.502]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:57:57.562 --> 02:57:57.922]  Hello.
[02:57:58.062 --> 02:58:02.944]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[02:58:03.164 --> 02:58:03.785]  It's amazing.
[02:58:03.905 --> 02:58:08.186]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever.
[02:58:08.406 --> 02:58:12.648]  And the antihistamines sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never cause
[02:58:12.868 --> 02:58:14.409]  This is a known patent out of France.
[02:58:14.429 --> 02:58:21.733]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[02:58:21.813 --> 02:58:25.294]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[02:58:42.543 --> 02:58:45.944]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[02:58:45.964 --> 02:58:46.785]  It just works.
[02:58:46.825 --> 02:58:57.509]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[02:58:57.529 --> 02:59:00.110]  Pollen block works every single time.
[02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:01.330]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[02:59:01.410 --> 02:59:04.771]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[02:59:04.971 --> 02:59:07.072]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[02:59:07.152 --> 02:59:08.152]  It's very complex.
[02:59:08.172 --> 02:59:08.992]  They don't even know why.
[02:59:09.012 --> 02:59:12.313]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[02:59:12.913 --> 02:59:19.535]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[02:59:19.695 --> 02:59:21.415]  I go out and I do market research.
[02:59:21.575 --> 02:59:23.996]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[02:59:24.176 --> 02:59:25.516]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[02:59:25.836 --> 02:59:33.978]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a best-seller?
[02:59:34.018 --> 02:59:35.659]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[02:59:35.739 --> 02:59:40.960]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[02:59:41.481 --> 02:59:42.041]  It's not here.
[02:59:42.441 --> 02:59:45.862]  So we just made a souped-up version of it, discounted it, and it's palm-block.
[02:59:45.942 --> 02:59:47.302]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139er.
[02:59:55.106 --> 02:59:59.198]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.218 --> 03:00:01.044]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.168 --> 03:00:24.495]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[03:00:25.036 --> 03:00:26.778]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:01:01.929 --> 03:01:07.892]  The globalists and tyrants everywhere seek control, dumb down masses so they can play God.
[03:01:07.932 --> 03:01:24.642]  And the American system of true rugged individualism, the wild, wild West, everything we've been through, our entire history, beating the British Empire when no one else had ever done it up until that time, and it was ragtag forces that did it, is the stuff of legend.
[03:01:25.782 --> 03:01:34.910]  And that's why the globalists want to break up our families and demoralize us and give us false histories about our country so that they can break us down and control us.
[03:01:35.951 --> 03:01:46.421]  It's classic military tactics that when you occupy a nation and the people aren't giving up, you demoralize them, you teach them that they're bad people, you turn them against each other.
[03:01:48.220 --> 03:01:50.241]  But humanity is smarter than that.
[03:01:50.982 --> 03:02:15.756]  Despite all the cultural attacks, all the biological attacks, all the GMO, all the vaccines, all of it, still, humanity is beginning to awaken, not just here, but from Brazil, to Japan, to the coast of Spain, and Catalonia, to the great folks in Greece, right through Europe,
[03:02:17.987 --> 03:02:20.348]  In France and into the UK and Canada.
[03:02:20.949 --> 03:02:25.991]  And so the authoritarians are cracking down to make us submit and break our will.
[03:02:26.972 --> 03:02:30.754]  But fighting back is not something that's a labor.
[03:02:30.894 --> 03:02:31.734]  It's a pleasure.
[03:02:33.495 --> 03:02:37.437]  And the tighter they squeeze, the more people are going to wake up and resist.
[03:02:38.498 --> 03:02:40.278]  But it's an incredibly dangerous time as well.
[03:02:40.379 --> 03:02:46.702]  And that's why listeners and viewers have to understand that this is
[03:02:48.328 --> 03:02:49.009]  Very, very close.
[03:02:50.270 --> 03:03:09.647]  They are attacking and savagely destroying and stabbing, you know, the president of Brazil in the stomach and trying to destroy the Trump family and coming after me and trying to defeat anybody they can ahead of major moves they're going to pull in the next year.
[03:03:10.768 --> 03:03:12.710]  This is the most critical time in human development.
[03:03:13.291 --> 03:03:14.051]  Everybody sees it.
[03:03:14.211 --> 03:03:14.692]  They feel it.
[03:03:16.141 --> 03:03:20.706]  And that's why I sit up here, never crying wolf, saying we're under attack, we need your support.
[03:03:20.786 --> 03:03:26.733]  And you've always rallied, you've always supported, but over time, believe me, I get sick of it.
[03:03:27.294 --> 03:03:31.418]  I love fighting the gloveless, but I don't like having to sit up here and ask for your support.
[03:03:32.559 --> 03:03:37.485]  So when I do it, I make sure it's something you really need, so I feel good about pushing it.
[03:03:40.714 --> 03:03:44.677]  Gosh, if I was selling tickets to Vegas to go gambling, I'd think I'd jump off a cliff.
[03:03:44.717 --> 03:03:47.158]  But I'm promoting water filtration for you and your children.
[03:03:47.178 --> 03:03:47.739]  That's a must.
[03:03:48.199 --> 03:03:50.300]  All the stuff in the water table, I'm promoting air filtration.
[03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:55.864]  I'm promoting non-GMO heirloom seeds that are great to plant, whether you live in the city or out in the countryside.
[03:03:55.884 --> 03:03:58.545]  I promote great supplements.
[03:03:58.625 --> 03:03:59.566]  I promote t-shirts.
[03:04:00.587 --> 03:04:02.128]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:04:03.476 --> 03:04:05.337]  Because I'm beyond superstitious.
[03:04:05.897 --> 03:04:06.957]  I am a superstition.
[03:04:06.977 --> 03:04:08.238]  You know what I mean?
[03:04:08.858 --> 03:04:09.798]  I'm not superstitious.
[03:04:10.078 --> 03:04:10.939]  I'm a superstition.
[03:04:10.959 --> 03:04:12.399]  That's something I just coined.
[03:04:12.419 --> 03:04:16.481]  I just automatically can't do things that are bad to people.
[03:04:17.421 --> 03:04:19.322]  When I am bad, I feel really sorry for it.
[03:04:20.222 --> 03:04:21.903]  And so you're getting a straight shoot here.
[03:04:22.823 --> 03:04:30.305]  And we've got only a few days left of 50 to 60% off and store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points and so much more.
[03:04:30.345 --> 03:04:31.366]  And at these prices,
[03:04:32.807 --> 03:04:37.429]  We didn't really make that much money off of it, but people like the product so much it ends up later than reordering, so it's worth it.
[03:04:37.449 --> 03:04:41.631]  But just, please take action, and know you couldn't put your dollars down.
[03:04:42.812 --> 03:04:46.554]  You couldn't put your money down somewhere to get better products that go to a better cause.
[03:04:46.654 --> 03:04:48.715]  It's a win-win, and you're crazy.
[03:04:49.435 --> 03:04:54.598]  If you don't, get the X2, or get the Brain Force, or get the Wake of America Coffee, and then sign up for AutoShip.
[03:04:54.718 --> 03:04:55.398]  We need your help.
[03:04:55.418 --> 03:04:57.879]  I want to thank you all that have, and encourage those that haven't.
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:04:59.340]  What are you thinking, man?
[03:04:59.580 --> 03:05:00.821]  We need your help right now.
[03:05:03.194 --> 03:05:05.235]  I mean, I've explained this.
[03:05:05.556 --> 03:05:17.263]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of social media last year, saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state, and just said I did it.
[03:05:18.604 --> 03:05:24.828]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[03:05:26.267 --> 03:05:42.846]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[03:05:44.474 --> 03:05:46.614]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[03:05:46.634 --> 03:05:49.095]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[03:05:49.915 --> 03:05:51.075]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[03:05:51.115 --> 03:05:53.396]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[03:05:53.996 --> 03:05:56.196]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[03:05:57.656 --> 03:05:59.097]  All I have is you supporting us.
[03:06:00.177 --> 03:06:00.817]  That's all I have.
[03:06:14.804 --> 03:06:21.210]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[03:06:41.735 --> 03:06:42.496]  It's like talking to you.
[03:06:42.556 --> 03:06:43.417]  Talking to your soul.
[03:07:16.417 --> 03:07:18.018]  He's footin' motor drive!
[03:07:19.158 --> 03:07:20.099]  Alright, let's get into it.
[03:07:26.622 --> 03:07:29.283]  Alright, here it is.
[03:07:30.743 --> 03:07:32.544]  This is such a critical article.
[03:07:33.585 --> 03:07:34.925]  And such a critical issue.
[03:07:36.286 --> 03:07:42.629]  And people that are ignorant, and I don't mean that in a pleasurable way, like you ignorant, conservatives and libertarians and people that I know,
[03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:47.743]  Watch some folks out there do cheap shots on the president.
[03:07:48.083 --> 03:07:54.548]  And if the president's doing something wrong, I'm the first to say, get on his butt, because he actually listens, which is very refreshing.
[03:07:54.568 --> 03:07:59.532]  I mean, Garrison earlier, I'm like, please make cartoons telling Trump to stop the censorship.
[03:07:59.572 --> 03:08:01.074]  He goes, well, Trump's trying hard.
[03:08:01.194 --> 03:08:02.855]  I know he needs the stimulus.
[03:08:03.295 --> 03:08:05.117]  And believe me, he's seeing your cartoons, Garrison.
[03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:10.281]  It's a lot of fire under Trump's butt.
[03:08:10.321 --> 03:08:11.883]  He's got a lot of people distracting him.
[03:08:12.728 --> 03:08:14.688]  And the globalists are obsessed with stopping people from getting to him.
[03:08:14.728 --> 03:08:17.129]  So, when I tell you this, it's not an attack on Trump.
[03:08:17.649 --> 03:08:18.869]  He's trying to fix this.
[03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:23.050]  But yes, people are like the Border Patrol are a bunch of traitors.
[03:08:24.090 --> 03:08:27.571]  Why, they're releasing 5,000 people a day!
[03:08:28.711 --> 03:08:29.431]  That was last month.
[03:08:31.332 --> 03:08:36.413]  Okay, well, how about I drop off 500 people at your house and see how you take care of them?
[03:08:38.203 --> 03:08:39.905]  We played the reports last night from the Border Patrol.
[03:08:39.925 --> 03:08:42.067]  They're saying rent alert, SOS.
[03:08:42.888 --> 03:08:45.531]  We normally get 3,000 people max in McAllen a day.
[03:08:45.551 --> 03:08:48.435]  3,000 is our emergency level.
[03:08:48.655 --> 03:08:50.537]  4,000 is unheard of in El Paso.
[03:08:52.339 --> 03:08:53.060]  There was 12,000 yesterday.
[03:08:54.321 --> 03:08:54.742]  There's 15,000 today.
[03:08:58.945 --> 03:09:04.208]  And the media's there going, look, they've got them held behind fences under rainy underpasses.
[03:09:04.748 --> 03:09:07.970]  They don't have the vans, the trucks, the detention facilities.
[03:09:09.011 --> 03:09:10.131]  They broke the border!
[03:09:11.612 --> 03:09:15.254]  I don't want to panic people, and Trump's trying to fix it, but our country's being broke right now.
[03:09:16.675 --> 03:09:18.676]  Well, that Trump isn't doing anything.
[03:09:22.048 --> 03:09:24.290]  The judges and the federal laws block it.
[03:09:24.330 --> 03:09:25.350]  He's trying to get the laws changed.
[03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:26.391]  He declared an emergency.
[03:09:27.072 --> 03:09:28.853]  He put the military down there to help people.
[03:09:29.914 --> 03:09:36.098]  And he's trying to get ready for the optics, which is in Rex 84, for the military to put people on military bases.
[03:09:36.579 --> 03:09:37.920]  Either that or it's going to be on the streets.
[03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:41.042]  They are collapsing the third world right now.
[03:09:41.863 --> 03:09:44.525]  Huge areas of South Texas are now unlivable.
[03:09:45.393 --> 03:09:46.794]  By the way, it's like 90% Hispanic.
[03:09:46.974 --> 03:09:48.455]  They're begging it to stop.
[03:09:49.096 --> 03:09:56.241]  You try, in some town of a thousand, having 5, 10,000, 20,000 illegals wandering around breaking into your garage, raping your daughter.
[03:09:56.261 --> 03:10:00.004]  80% of the women that are brought up throughout Mexico get raped.
[03:10:00.504 --> 03:10:01.345]  Amnesty International.
[03:10:01.525 --> 03:10:02.686]  It's hell!
[03:10:06.068 --> 03:10:10.151]  And Trump's cutting funding to Central America.
[03:10:10.171 --> 03:10:12.413]  He's about to cut funding to Mexico unless they control it.
[03:10:13.513 --> 03:10:16.116]  They are... Latin America is collapsing.
[03:10:17.377 --> 03:10:19.920]  Central America is in civil war.
[03:10:21.741 --> 03:10:24.004]  And the UN now is running this entire thing.
[03:10:25.902 --> 03:10:28.342]  So, under Obama, he started this, the encouragement.
[03:10:28.622 --> 03:10:31.523]  Even the Washington Post admitted thousands of children disappeared into sex slavery.
[03:10:31.883 --> 03:10:34.904]  Unaccompanied kids with men, with no IDs, little girls.
[03:10:34.924 --> 03:10:38.244]  In some cases, like one coyote with eight little girls.
[03:10:38.504 --> 03:10:39.564]  Some of them age five.
[03:10:40.185 --> 03:10:44.705]  And then they just disappear into Democrat vans and are shipped off to who the hell knows where.
[03:10:45.806 --> 03:10:47.786]  And then a famous reporter shoots this video.
[03:10:48.386 --> 03:10:50.166]  She's doing it on her own, not where she works.
[03:10:52.287 --> 03:10:53.827]  And she sends us this footage.
[03:10:56.158 --> 03:10:58.422]  Because she's scared her own network won't even put it on.
[03:10:58.442 --> 03:11:02.090]  And it's just like chopped liver.
[03:11:03.091 --> 03:11:03.693]  Shut on her phone.
[03:11:04.334 --> 03:11:06.698]  This is Catholic Charities RGV.
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:12.601]  You got people saying, don't videotape the Border Patrol pulling up because they don't know where to keep it.
[03:11:12.821 --> 03:11:20.483]  The Democrats go, don't worry, you bring the illegal aliens that we told come here that you don't have room for, you bring them to our church, and who the hell knows?
[03:11:20.683 --> 03:11:22.264]  Of course, they don't want footage of the kids.
[03:11:23.184 --> 03:11:26.405]  Oh, to stop smugglers, right, so there's no record of these little kids.
[03:11:26.425 --> 03:11:28.425]  Should have started the whole show with this.
[03:11:28.445 --> 03:11:30.106]  This is show bombshell.
[03:11:31.254 --> 03:11:32.475]  It's on NewsWars.com.
[03:11:32.755 --> 03:11:34.036]  That doesn't get censored as much.
[03:11:34.656 --> 03:11:35.376]  Share that link.
[03:11:35.536 --> 03:11:36.617]  NewsWars.com.
[03:11:36.997 --> 03:11:38.258]  InfoWars exclusive video.
[03:11:38.918 --> 03:11:41.560]  Border Patrol being used as illegal immigrant Uber service.
[03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:42.720]  It's worse than that.
[03:11:43.361 --> 03:11:47.083]  Rob News stayed up till midnight getting this out last night with Jamie White and the rest of the crew.
[03:11:47.103 --> 03:11:50.685]  I'm not bitching, I'm just saying we're ragtag, man.
[03:11:50.925 --> 03:11:52.946]  We're working seven days a week, a lot of us.
[03:11:53.466 --> 03:11:55.867]  Eighteen hours a day because it's our moral responsibility.
[03:11:55.887 --> 03:11:58.409]  We get something like this, we don't even get to see our kids.
[03:12:00.555 --> 03:12:01.835]  Let me get this damn article out.
[03:12:02.676 --> 03:12:08.437]  What it should say is, Witness Border Patrol engaged in child smuggling under federal law.
[03:12:08.637 --> 03:12:09.457]  Think the Border Patrol's happy?
[03:12:09.477 --> 03:12:10.538]  They're the ones who told us about it.
[03:12:13.659 --> 03:12:14.759]  They're beside themselves.
[03:12:14.999 --> 03:12:17.160]  But if they quit, it totally collapses.
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:21.061]  So then they have to be involved in a lesser evil to stop the total collapse.
[03:12:21.081 --> 03:12:22.001]  You see how that works?
[03:12:23.643 --> 03:12:25.765]  Turns out there are lesser of evils in there in this world.
[03:12:26.125 --> 03:12:32.532]  But what we need to do is stop Congress and Beto and all these traitors that are literally aiding and abetting this.
[03:12:33.413 --> 03:12:36.055]  Here is the censored video only at NewsWars.com.
[03:12:36.095 --> 03:12:36.536]  Here it is.
[03:12:42.161 --> 03:12:44.644]  You cannot take pictures of this, ma'am.
[03:12:46.219 --> 03:12:46.279]  Why?
[03:12:46.299 --> 03:12:46.399]  Yep.
[03:12:46.659 --> 03:12:47.480]  Very simply.
[03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:49.942]  Their family members now know they're here.
[03:12:50.002 --> 03:12:52.764]  The people who they borrowed money from know they're here.
[03:12:52.784 --> 03:12:53.224]  Uh-huh.
[03:12:53.264 --> 03:12:54.926]  And now they'll extort them for the money.
[03:12:55.306 --> 03:12:57.148]  So if you want to put them in danger... I do.
[03:12:57.168 --> 03:12:59.570]  We're taking pictures.
[03:12:59.590 --> 03:13:01.391]  We had a disguised... Good pause.
[03:13:01.411 --> 03:13:03.893]  We had a disguised woman's voice that's so recognizable.
[03:13:04.694 --> 03:13:12.440]  So there are famous reporters for famous networks that on their vacation are fighting because their network won't let you see this.
[03:13:13.081 --> 03:13:14.182]  You can't make this up.
[03:13:16.408 --> 03:13:18.869]  This is shot on a female reporter's phone.
[03:13:20.650 --> 03:13:21.911]  By herself at the border.
[03:13:23.291 --> 03:13:23.672]  Continue.
[03:13:28.078 --> 03:13:30.341]  This is a Catholic Charities Centre.
[03:13:30.361 --> 03:13:34.767]  It's a respite centre for the illegals who are coming across the border.
[03:13:34.907 --> 03:13:40.654]  These are 1, 2, 3, 4 border control vehicles here to drop off people and bring them here.
[03:13:41.696 --> 03:13:46.162]  The lady is really upset that I'm taking this video of the people arriving.
[03:13:59.350 --> 03:14:00.931]  What have I told you thousands of times?
[03:14:00.951 --> 03:14:03.012]  Because I see it in the news and always it's buried.
[03:14:03.412 --> 03:14:05.833]  They had the mayor's family, all these people.
[03:14:06.294 --> 03:14:08.995]  They'll catch like 10 illegals in dungeons under their house.
[03:14:09.756 --> 03:14:11.177]  Only folks have basements around here.
[03:14:12.222 --> 03:14:13.443]  Our dungeon keeper liberals.
[03:14:14.043 --> 03:14:16.905]  And then they'll have baseball bats, they're sucking money out of them.
[03:14:17.625 --> 03:14:23.028]  And so, the Border Patrol delivers, in many cases, to the coyotes to suck the money out of them.
[03:14:23.529 --> 03:14:25.590]  And the women are sent to prostitution, all of it.
[03:14:26.290 --> 03:14:34.535]  And there are a lot of great Catholics on there and everything, but the Catholic Church itself is liberal in Texas and Mexico, and is aiding and abetting the collapse of this country.
[03:14:36.189 --> 03:14:39.231]  Remember Soros partners with MasterCard to hand out money to migrants?
[03:14:40.072 --> 03:14:42.754]  He posed for photos in Reuters and bragged about it.
[03:14:42.794 --> 03:14:43.754]  Lou Dobbs covered it.
[03:14:44.635 --> 03:14:46.096]  I said, we apologize at Fox.
[03:14:46.156 --> 03:14:46.776]  It's not true.
[03:14:46.856 --> 03:14:47.917]  Soros isn't involved.
[03:14:48.257 --> 03:14:50.319]  He's just in hundreds of articles bragging about it.
[03:14:51.079 --> 03:14:51.820]  We apologize.
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:52.860]  Birds don't fly.
[03:14:53.201 --> 03:14:54.241]  The sky's not blue.
[03:14:55.002 --> 03:14:56.323]  Turkeys aren't eaten on Easter.
[03:14:56.883 --> 03:14:57.604]  And so aren't you.
[03:14:59.406 --> 03:15:03.169]  I take it down, says Beto O'Rourke, of current border barriers.
[03:15:03.489 --> 03:15:06.391]  There is no crisis and no problem.
[03:15:06.712 --> 03:15:08.573]  Just 200,000 dead in Mexico.
[03:15:08.833 --> 03:15:11.295]  Just travel advisories to most Mexican states.
[03:15:12.596 --> 03:15:18.301]  By the way, I thought it was hype that Cancun, where I've been going since I was a kid, is too dangerous to be in.
[03:15:18.341 --> 03:15:23.785]  So we flew down there and I said, OK, we'll get it where they say there's not any crime, Isla Mujeres, off the coast.
[03:15:23.825 --> 03:15:25.986]  We still fly into Cancun to be in that.
[03:15:27.441 --> 03:15:31.889]  Quintana Roo or whatever you call that state in Yucatan Peninsula.
[03:15:33.231 --> 03:15:37.312]  Armored vehicles, troops everywhere, people running around scared.
[03:15:37.392 --> 03:15:43.054]  And I learned while we were on Isla Mujeres for a week, or five days, every night people were killed.
[03:15:43.094 --> 03:15:48.135]  People in their hotel rooms, marine gun battles, people robbed at the steakhouses.
[03:15:48.915 --> 03:15:51.996]  Because we had a Mexican federali with us who was off duty that I had for security.
[03:15:52.616 --> 03:15:57.738]  He showed me all the police reports, all the intel, the surveillance footage, the death every night.
[03:15:57.758 --> 03:15:59.518]  Just total frickin' war, man.
[03:15:59.838 --> 03:16:00.799]  Way worse than you hear.
[03:16:00.859 --> 03:16:01.719]  Don't go to Cancun.
[03:16:04.046 --> 03:16:05.589]  A new habitat has appeared.
[03:16:06.690 --> 03:16:11.176]  Entirely designed and constructed by one species for its own purpose.
[03:16:14.301 --> 03:16:17.986]  These crevices contain the highest density of lizards in the world.
[03:16:19.815 --> 03:16:27.437]  And to early visitors, this new world was already home to First Nations people.
[03:16:29.117 --> 03:16:31.538]  I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees.
[03:16:31.758 --> 03:16:37.779]  A young brain searches for understanding in slow stages, working out what things are and how they work.
[03:16:37.839 --> 03:16:39.880]  Out comes a tiny, underdeveloped little worm.
[03:16:46.750 --> 03:16:47.750]  We gotta do what we can.
[03:16:47.770 --> 03:16:48.991]  We always have.
[03:16:49.131 --> 03:16:52.112]  This is a male, and life here suits him well.
[03:16:57.154 --> 03:17:07.618]  This extraordinary creature is half blind, half deaf, and this is just about as fast as it can move.
[03:17:08.218 --> 03:17:13.840]  You might think that this is some kind of circus trick for which he's been specially trained, but not so.
[03:17:14.840 --> 03:17:18.284]  She is doing this entirely on her own initiative.
[03:17:18.324 --> 03:17:20.946]  She's seen others doing it, and she's copying.
[03:17:21.387 --> 03:17:23.469]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[03:17:25.091 --> 03:17:30.476]  I've come too far!
[03:17:30.916 --> 03:17:35.001]  This male has gigantic testes, the largest in the world.
[03:17:35.041 --> 03:17:38.104]  They weigh a ton and produce gallons of sperm.
[03:17:39.622 --> 03:17:47.729]  You know, it is, uh, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[03:17:48.350 --> 03:17:49.231]  Because you'd be in jail.
[03:18:02.995 --> 03:18:05.577]  We're living in incredibly historic times.
[03:18:06.498 --> 03:18:07.179]  No one can deny it.
[03:18:07.920 --> 03:18:09.301]  World governments out in the open.
[03:18:09.401 --> 03:18:14.426]  They're creating animal-human hybrid clones and it's in the back of the newspaper.
[03:18:15.267 --> 03:18:17.008]  There's open attacks on the family.
[03:18:17.649 --> 03:18:28.199]  A convicted child rapist are brought in with no background checks to teach three-year-old children in Houston public facilities how to engage in sexual activities.
[03:18:29.571 --> 03:18:33.416]  Ladies and gentlemen, humanity itself is under siege.
[03:18:34.477 --> 03:18:42.567]  It's being scientifically deployed to demoralize us, to dumb us down, to poison us, to confuse us.
[03:18:43.615 --> 03:18:45.796]  The bad news is it's highly organized and focused.
[03:18:46.276 --> 03:19:05.360]  The good news is it's so compartmentalized, there's only a few thousand globalists, corporate fascists, that actually are part of the program, that if we just awaken the general masses, and we awaken those right below the technocrats, many of the functionaries, we can blow their system politically out of the water.
[03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:08.081]  But right now they're pushing more than ever.
[03:19:09.042 --> 03:19:12.884]  To preemptively silence all speech that's not corporate.
[03:19:13.505 --> 03:19:15.566]  Just today, I randomly turned on CNN.
[03:19:15.946 --> 03:19:21.009]  Brian Stelter was talking about how evil free speech is and how we have to ban it for everybody but CNN.
[03:19:21.309 --> 03:19:23.030]  Then I got in the car and turned on NPR.
[03:19:23.370 --> 03:19:28.193]  They were attacking me, lying about InfoWars, and saying that we need to be shut down and silenced.
[03:19:29.682 --> 03:19:36.848]  That's just today when I randomly turned on the television to work out and got in my car to drive to the studio.
[03:19:37.389 --> 03:19:38.510]  That's because they're scared of you.
[03:19:39.010 --> 03:19:39.771]  They're scared of me.
[03:19:39.791 --> 03:19:41.533]  They're scared of this huge awakening.
[03:19:41.993 --> 03:19:52.763]  That's why now more than ever, when you spread the articles from NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com, when you spread those videos, when you tell your friends, your neighbors, your family about the Vermont broadcast, you
[03:19:53.343 --> 03:19:57.565]  Literally break the back of the globalists politically, metaphysically and spiritually.
[03:19:57.805 --> 03:19:59.886]  So keep taking action and I salute you.
[03:20:00.026 --> 03:20:01.306]  But don't let them silence you.
[03:20:06.769 --> 03:20:09.370]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:30.340 --> 03:20:32.681]  Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, is about to take over.
[03:20:33.942 --> 03:20:35.282]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:20:35.302 --> 03:20:42.366]  I just briefly wanted to talk to everybody out there about something very simple.
[03:20:45.007 --> 03:20:52.911]  The power of word of mouth, the power to override the silicon iron curtain, is beyond paramount.
[03:20:53.051 --> 03:20:53.971]  It is essential.
[03:20:55.412 --> 03:20:59.334]  And you, the viewer and the listener, out of the whole spectrum
[03:21:00.669 --> 03:21:10.977]  of billions of voices and millions of programs around the world are able to decide that the information we cover here is important.
[03:21:12.158 --> 03:21:15.241]  The globalists have already decided that we are a kryptonite to their evil.
[03:21:16.602 --> 03:21:29.732]  They've already hit the panic button and said at any cost, shut him up, shut InfoWars down because of the guests and the listeners and the Paul Revere service that all of us together provide.
[03:21:30.967 --> 03:21:36.170]  We're the simple, free-market, common-sense folks that built civilization in this world.
[03:21:37.150 --> 03:21:38.931]  And we are rebooting what we know works.
[03:21:39.852 --> 03:21:45.635]  That's why I want to thank you and salute you, and encourage you all to keep using your free speech, because you are the resistance.
[03:21:46.715 --> 03:21:48.796]  Now, Gerald Cilente takes over.
[03:21:48.836 --> 03:21:49.316]  Thank you, Gerald.
[03:21:50.317 --> 03:21:52.538]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you for all that you do.
[03:21:53.358 --> 03:22:00.022]  And what Alex was saying to support InfoWars and the wonderful products that they have, like those water filters,
[03:22:00.776 --> 03:22:04.358]  And here's a story that just came out this weekend.
[03:22:05.578 --> 03:22:09.560]  Is Poland's spring water really from a spring?
[03:22:10.620 --> 03:22:15.262]  Not one drop, a lawsuit claims.
[03:22:16.663 --> 03:22:24.786]  Not one drop of Poland's spring water actually qualifies as spring water, the lawsuit says.
[03:22:26.307 --> 03:22:30.469]  It is common groundwater that has been
[03:22:30.942 --> 03:22:41.407]  Illegally mislabeled in order to reap massive undue sales.
[03:22:41.748 --> 03:22:44.989]  That's what the lawsuit says.
[03:22:46.930 --> 03:22:52.013]  So again, you know, people are talking about climate change and this and that.
[03:22:52.553 --> 03:22:57.536]  How about stopping the poisons that are killing us right now?
[03:22:58.036 --> 03:22:59.737]  And that's why you want to buy
[03:23:00.922 --> 03:23:08.266]  A water filter from InfoWars and other products to keep you healthy at this time of mass poisoning.
[03:23:09.327 --> 03:23:17.072]  What they're throwing into the ground that's polluting our food, our water, and what they're putting into the air.
[03:23:18.092 --> 03:23:30.520]  So these products are very essential, not only to keep you healthy and happy, but also to keep InfoWars to thrive
[03:23:31.152 --> 03:23:39.054]  Survive and help you as well cash in on the benefits of freedom of speech.
[03:23:39.074 --> 03:23:45.495]  I want to talk about some international going-ons at this time.
[03:23:46.215 --> 03:23:48.776]  They had an election over there in Turkey yesterday.
[03:23:50.256 --> 03:23:52.356]  Opposition claims victory in Ankara.
[03:23:53.016 --> 03:23:54.657]  Pulls ahead in Istanbul.
[03:23:55.437 --> 03:23:57.577]  Istanbul means Constantinople.
[03:23:57.677 --> 03:23:58.898]  That was a song when I was a kid.
[03:24:01.377 --> 03:24:02.678]  What's going on over there?
[03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:06.961]  An economic slowdown.
[03:24:07.801 --> 03:24:10.403]  The Turkish leader has been getting battered by the U.S.
[03:24:10.423 --> 03:24:10.843]  dollar.
[03:24:11.904 --> 03:24:29.595]  I mention this because this is the issue of virtually every election around the world, except in the U.S.S.A., where we got all these little candidates that are running in the presidential reality show.
[03:24:31.226 --> 03:24:51.519]  And the fraud of the frauds, as I see it, and you know the motto of the Trends Journal, Think for Yourself, is that Beto O'Rourke, which I had forecast on David's Night Show back in February, that he would be running and he'd be the leading contender.
[03:24:51.539 --> 03:24:54.440]  This is two months before he announced.
[03:24:55.421 --> 03:24:57.582]  So, where are we going with this?
[03:24:59.083 --> 03:25:00.164]  I was listening to him.
[03:25:01.718 --> 03:25:02.418]  Painfully.
[03:25:02.438 --> 03:25:10.283]  And what he had to say when he announced his candidacy officially in El Paso.
[03:25:14.105 --> 03:25:19.648]  The challenges before us are the greatest of our lifetime.
[03:25:21.289 --> 03:25:22.589]  What are you kidding me?
[03:25:23.950 --> 03:25:25.711]  What challenges you're talking about?
[03:25:26.357 --> 03:25:27.018]  Junior.
[03:25:27.598 --> 03:25:29.981]  Or I should say, White Obama.
[03:25:30.361 --> 03:25:33.344]  And don't call me racist for calling a white cat, cat.
[03:25:33.745 --> 03:25:34.686]  But he ain't a cat.
[03:25:35.346 --> 03:25:38.069]  I would say he's a pussy cat.
[03:25:40.892 --> 03:25:41.893]  He's a nothing.
[03:25:42.734 --> 03:25:44.716]  His head's going all over.
[03:25:45.096 --> 03:25:49.541]  Nothing more than a lot of empty garbage spewing out of the
[03:25:50.313 --> 03:25:54.495]  Privileged boy's mouth who plays like he's the common man.
[03:25:54.875 --> 03:25:56.836]  Oh, granddaddy's a billionaire.
[03:25:57.316 --> 03:25:59.757]  Yeah, my daddy, he married a rich woman, too.
[03:26:00.197 --> 03:26:01.818]  Runs in the family, doesn't it?
[03:26:02.738 --> 03:26:05.600]  Went to a privileged private school.
[03:26:06.260 --> 03:26:06.520]  Yep.
[03:26:07.941 --> 03:26:08.401]  And nothing.
[03:26:08.981 --> 03:26:09.601]  And nobody.
[03:26:10.042 --> 03:26:19.726]  And here's what else the white Obama blew out when he announced his candidacy.
[03:26:21.397 --> 03:26:25.459]  The Presidential Reality Show on Sunday.
[03:26:28.821 --> 03:26:31.882]  This is our moment of truth.
[03:26:31.902 --> 03:26:35.224]  Oh, it's your moment of truth?
[03:26:36.945 --> 03:26:38.606]  What truth are you talking about?
[03:26:39.358 --> 03:26:40.959]  Hey, give me some examples.
[03:26:41.479 --> 03:26:42.180]  Junior.
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:47.904]  See, I can call him Junior when I call Obama Junior, then I'm racist.
[03:26:48.144 --> 03:26:51.106]  But I'm not racist anymore, Junior.
[03:26:51.126 --> 03:26:58.671]  I call all little boys Junior, regardless of race, creed, and color.
[03:27:00.788 --> 03:27:04.830]  Or little boys, regardless of race, creed, and color.
[03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:18.995]  I'm tired of these little cowards, with cojones much smaller than mothballs, playing tough guy when they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, but send other people to go do their murderous killing.
[03:27:19.735 --> 03:27:24.617]  Oh yeah, you got a track record there, Beto, or is it B-O?
[03:27:26.801 --> 03:27:32.904]  Of all those military budgets that you voted for, nothing.
[03:27:33.705 --> 03:27:38.227]  Anyway, going back to elections, another one in Algeria.
[03:27:39.027 --> 03:27:42.069]  They're trying to get rid of this president that's been around since 1999.
[03:27:43.049 --> 03:27:47.772]  The cat got a stroke a number of years ago.
[03:27:48.552 --> 03:27:52.734]  He has not publicly spoken to the people in six years.
[03:27:53.655 --> 03:27:56.316]  And so the flunky crew behind him is running the show.
[03:27:57.045 --> 03:27:57.585]  Guess what?
[03:27:58.385 --> 03:27:59.886]  The people are taken to the streets.
[03:28:01.806 --> 03:28:04.486]  By the hundreds of thousands, millions!
[03:28:05.807 --> 03:28:07.467]  And they're making change happen.
[03:28:09.027 --> 03:28:09.487]  Turkey.
[03:28:10.868 --> 03:28:11.628]  Algeria.
[03:28:12.568 --> 03:28:14.108]  One nation after another.
[03:28:15.168 --> 03:28:17.429]  But not in the U.S.S.A.
[03:28:18.069 --> 03:28:18.309]  Nope.
[03:28:19.029 --> 03:28:20.569]  The country of cowards.
[03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:23.730]  Democrats and Republicans.
[03:28:24.477 --> 03:28:27.580]  Who in their right mind would support a Mitch McConnell?
[03:28:29.261 --> 03:28:30.322]  Or a Pelosi?
[03:28:31.643 --> 03:28:32.844]  A Feinstein?
[03:28:33.524 --> 03:28:34.365]  Or a Graham?
[03:28:35.506 --> 03:28:36.747]  A little Chuckie Schumer.
[03:28:38.428 --> 03:28:39.689]  No fight in America.
[03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:42.211]  That's why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:28:42.711 --> 03:28:43.692]  Keep the truth going.
[03:28:45.093 --> 03:28:47.555]  Because if you don't, you're going to take it away from us.
[03:28:49.096 --> 03:28:50.498]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:28:51.018 --> 03:28:53.500]  Don't forget, buy those InfoWars products.
[03:29:03.147 --> 03:29:03.808]  It's incredible.
[03:29:04.268 --> 03:29:07.089]  We're fighting back and we're winning thanks to you.
[03:29:07.109 --> 03:29:11.250]  I've got some good news for you folks, but some bad news for the globalists.
[03:29:13.751 --> 03:29:16.893]  I've got good news for the people of America and the people of the world.
[03:29:17.673 --> 03:29:22.935]  Trump has been totally exonerated from the entire Russian gate attempted coup d'etat takedown.
[03:29:23.675 --> 03:29:27.677]  And now he's going on the offense with the big executive order of a week ago
[03:29:29.028 --> 03:29:31.631]  Trump said the meeting went well.
[03:29:31.651 --> 03:29:35.474]  And the word is, Apple and Facebook and Twitter, they're all being
[03:29:53.726 --> 03:29:59.432]  Talked to by the President over the telephone, and private meetings are being set up where he's going to lay down the law.
[03:29:59.912 --> 03:30:10.283]  That they're not going to side with authoritarian foreign powers, that they're going to either abide by the Constitution and Bill of Rights and not be authoritarians, or he's going to take action against them.
[03:30:10.583 --> 03:30:12.585]  That is everything we've needed to hear.
[03:30:13.026 --> 03:30:14.788]  Now let's make sure the President follows through.
[03:30:15.288 --> 03:30:16.709]  Now, Infowars, as you know,
[03:30:17.290 --> 03:30:17.911]  We're good to go.
[03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:41.292]  We've got to end the sale coming up early next week.

[03:30:59.043 --> 03:31:01.264]  Super Sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:01.584 --> 03:31:02.365]  Only a few days left.
[03:31:03.069 --> 03:31:05.910]  The right wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones a five.
[03:31:05.930 --> 03:31:07.110]  1776 will come next again if you try to take off firearms.
[03:31:07.130 --> 03:31:07.790]  That man is Alex Jones.
[03:31:07.850 --> 03:31:09.591]  He's one of those guys who believes that Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:31:09.671 --> 03:31:10.651]  I've heard it on Alex Jones so I know it's true.
[03:31:10.671 --> 03:31:10.931]  Alex Jones.
[03:31:11.071 --> 03:31:11.471]  Alex Jones.
[03:31:11.491 --> 03:31:11.711]  Alex Jones.
[03:31:11.731 --> 03:31:12.011]  Alex Jones.
[03:31:12.071 --> 03:31:12.331]  Alex Jones.
[03:31:12.351 --> 03:31:12.592]  Alex Jones.
[03:31:12.612 --> 03:31:12.832]  Alex Jones.

[03:31:29.816 --> 03:31:37.785]  InfoWars.com InfoWars InfoWars Bill Clinton is a rapist InfoWars.com Bill Clinton is a rapist InfoWars.com InfoWars.com
[03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:42.932]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:31:43.012 --> 03:31:46.155]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[03:31:46.395 --> 03:31:47.596]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[03:31:47.736 --> 03:31:49.237]  InfoWars.com!
[03:31:49.297 --> 03:31:50.158]  InfoWars.
[03:31:50.298 --> 03:31:50.999]  InfoWars.
[03:31:51.139 --> 03:31:51.739]  InfoWars.
[03:31:51.800 --> 03:31:52.440]  InfoWars.
[03:31:52.500 --> 03:31:54.121]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[03:31:54.262 --> 03:31:57.684]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:31:57.825 --> 03:32:01.848]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[03:32:01.988 --> 03:32:03.509]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[03:32:03.549 --> 03:32:05.010]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[03:32:05.431 --> 03:32:07.792]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[03:32:07.892 --> 03:32:12.816]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier, promoting conspiracy theories.
[03:32:12.976 --> 03:32:18.120]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[03:32:18.220 --> 03:32:21.923]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment.
[03:32:21.943 --> 03:32:24.966]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[03:32:25.026 --> 03:32:32.413]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:32:32.473 --> 03:32:33.394]  Who is the most
[03:32:33.894 --> 03:32:35.736]  The most banned news network in the world.
[03:32:35.816 --> 03:32:36.857]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:32:37.017 --> 03:32:39.619]  Alex Jones has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[03:32:39.639 --> 03:32:42.281]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[03:32:42.402 --> 03:32:42.922]  It worked.
[03:32:43.442 --> 03:32:46.225]  Jeff Zucker silenced and de-platformed his show.
[03:32:46.445 --> 03:32:48.787]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[03:32:49.047 --> 03:32:53.972]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:32:56.694 --> 03:32:59.917]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[03:33:06.232 --> 03:33:19.859]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.020 --> 03:33:25.061]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:25.442 --> 03:33:27.563]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:33:28.143 --> 03:33:30.944]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.208 --> 03:33:35.529]  Hey, great being back with Alex Jones.
[03:33:35.989 --> 03:33:40.911]  And I love that little take on super male vitality.
[03:33:42.251 --> 03:33:43.912]  Keeps me alive and going.
[03:33:44.552 --> 03:33:52.855]  Got a boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy and super male vitality keeps that boogie going.
[03:33:53.215 --> 03:33:53.495]  Yeah.
[03:33:55.536 --> 03:34:00.637]  So talking about B.O., NATO, Iraq.
[03:34:01.898 --> 03:34:02.298]  Here's the
[03:34:03.174 --> 03:34:04.575]  From the toilet paper record.
[03:34:04.635 --> 03:34:06.577]  I meant said Sunday, I meant Saturday.
[03:34:07.758 --> 03:34:09.059]  That he announced, I believe.
[03:34:09.879 --> 03:34:13.923]  Immigration at core as a rock starts campaign.
[03:34:13.943 --> 03:34:22.790]  I heard Alex Jones, before I got on, say, all these people coming over the border, you want them to come over, put them in your house, feed them.
[03:34:23.050 --> 03:34:23.871]  That's what we say.
[03:34:24.531 --> 03:34:26.913]  We did a press release a number of months ago.
[03:34:27.734 --> 03:34:30.116]  Wall or no wall, let the people vote.
[03:34:31.277 --> 03:34:32.758]  Make it a national referendum.
[03:34:34.878 --> 03:34:36.259]  Yes, I want a wall.
[03:34:37.939 --> 03:34:40.821]  It will cost X billions of dollars.
[03:34:42.101 --> 03:34:43.982]  No, I don't want a wall.
[03:34:45.043 --> 03:34:52.446]  I am willing to pay more in taxes to take care of the immigrants coming into the country.
[03:34:53.987 --> 03:34:56.688]  And put out how much it would cost for each one coming in.
[03:34:58.088 --> 03:34:59.329]  So let the people vote on it.
[03:34:59.369 --> 03:35:00.409]  You want to pay more money?
[03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:01.850]  And here's what I say.
[03:35:02.871 --> 03:35:03.711]  You want to bring them in?
[03:35:04.266 --> 03:35:04.766]  Bring them in.
[03:35:05.566 --> 03:35:06.106]  House them.
[03:35:07.147 --> 03:35:07.687]  Feed them.
[03:35:08.667 --> 03:35:09.347]  Clothe them.
[03:35:10.287 --> 03:35:11.588]  Take care of their health care.
[03:35:11.608 --> 03:35:14.368]  Oh, and education.
[03:35:15.128 --> 03:35:16.088]  Oh, that's what B.O.
[03:35:16.148 --> 03:35:17.209]  wants to do, too.
[03:35:18.189 --> 03:35:21.770]  Besides, uh, better health care, which I'm more in favor of.
[03:35:21.790 --> 03:35:27.711]  He also called for better pay for teachers.
[03:35:30.618 --> 03:35:32.859]  Let's pay them what they're worth.
[03:35:32.939 --> 03:35:35.220]  Well, I'll tell you what I think they're worth.
[03:35:35.660 --> 03:35:37.001]  I think they're worth nothing.
[03:35:37.641 --> 03:35:40.262]  I can't stand the public education system.
[03:35:40.682 --> 03:35:43.343]  It's an industrial age model.
[03:35:44.364 --> 03:35:44.864]  Beethoven?
[03:35:45.924 --> 03:35:46.424]  That's right.
[03:35:46.704 --> 03:35:47.705]  Created by the Germans.
[03:35:48.845 --> 03:35:50.346]  The beginning of the industrial age.
[03:35:50.746 --> 03:35:52.667]  Took people off all their farms.
[03:35:53.618 --> 03:35:56.363]  In our hometowns and put them in centralized locations.
[03:35:56.844 --> 03:35:57.926]  Industrialization.
[03:35:58.407 --> 03:36:03.637]  Taught them how to read, write, do a little bit of arithmetic, and follow orders!
[03:36:04.963 --> 03:36:06.444]  To follow orders.
[03:36:06.764 --> 03:36:09.626]  That's all this stinking education system does.
[03:36:10.186 --> 03:36:11.207]  Follow orders.
[03:36:11.547 --> 03:36:13.048]  A general education, sir.
[03:36:13.408 --> 03:36:14.449]  General education.
[03:36:14.729 --> 03:36:16.290]  You gotta learn chemistry, biology.
[03:36:16.310 --> 03:36:19.532]  You have to learn a lot of crap that you'll never use and you have no mind for.
[03:36:19.853 --> 03:36:21.334]  Because we say so.
[03:36:21.634 --> 03:36:33.842]  We're a bunch of arrogant people that you pay a lot of money, particularly these superintendents like the clown we got over here in Kingston that makes all this money and is nothing more than a waste of money.
[03:36:34.602 --> 03:36:38.444]  And one in your country, or county, city, and state.
[03:36:39.605 --> 03:36:40.205]  More pay?
[03:36:40.765 --> 03:36:43.787]  Do away with the public education system.
[03:36:44.407 --> 03:36:45.668]  You want to have kids?
[03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:47.409]  You educate them.
[03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:48.910]  You got the internet now.
[03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:51.051]  You have the Alexandrian Library.
[03:36:51.511 --> 03:36:52.532]  People are bored.
[03:36:52.772 --> 03:36:53.773]  They're bored, man.
[03:36:54.093 --> 03:36:54.393]  And woof!
[03:36:55.256 --> 03:36:57.517]  They're on their computers already.
[03:36:57.837 --> 03:37:00.137]  That's their life in the new generation.
[03:37:00.717 --> 03:37:04.058]  Generation Z equals Generation Zero.
[03:37:04.398 --> 03:37:07.019]  Wrote about it in one of our Top Trends in 2019.
[03:37:07.319 --> 03:37:08.979]  They're addicted to these things.
[03:37:09.399 --> 03:37:14.021]  They don't like being social, so they don't have to send them to school.
[03:37:14.281 --> 03:37:15.801]  And what do these schools look like?
[03:37:16.361 --> 03:37:17.001]  Prisons!
[03:37:17.521 --> 03:37:19.562]  They're so damn ugly!
[03:37:20.702 --> 03:37:23.443]  Anyway, public education
[03:37:24.366 --> 03:37:25.626]  Only for the poorest.
[03:37:26.487 --> 03:37:27.527]  That's my vote.
[03:37:28.707 --> 03:37:30.067]  You want to have children?
[03:37:30.568 --> 03:37:32.108]  Have as many as you want.
[03:37:32.768 --> 03:37:33.768]  You pay for them.
[03:37:34.308 --> 03:37:35.349]  I'll pay some.
[03:37:36.129 --> 03:37:37.549]  Here I am at my age.
[03:37:37.909 --> 03:37:39.830]  I've still got to pay school taxes.
[03:37:40.190 --> 03:37:41.990]  Oh, and by the way, I've never had any children.
[03:37:45.711 --> 03:37:45.991]  So.
[03:37:47.592 --> 03:37:48.412]  That's Beto.
[03:37:49.232 --> 03:37:53.133]  More BS from B.O.
[03:37:54.036 --> 03:37:55.736]  And boys, the media pumping them.
[03:37:57.037 --> 03:38:00.097]  Now I want to talk about some other issues.
[03:38:00.157 --> 03:38:04.698]  I was talking about elections overseas.
[03:38:05.818 --> 03:38:06.439]  Over there.
[03:38:07.839 --> 03:38:08.319]  Over there.
[03:38:08.339 --> 03:38:09.179]  Remember over there?
[03:38:09.199 --> 03:38:22.162]  Remember over there how the United States, under the Nobel piece of crap prize winner Obama, overthrew the democratically elected government of Ukraine?
[03:38:22.782 --> 03:38:23.142]  Yeah.
[03:38:24.597 --> 03:38:25.797]  Ah, that's only history.
[03:38:26.918 --> 03:38:28.398]  You remember Victoria Nuland?
[03:38:28.998 --> 03:38:29.218]  Yep.
[03:38:29.638 --> 03:38:31.899]  Her husband, the head of that right-wing group?
[03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:38.700]  Passing out cookies over there to the protesters?
[03:38:40.661 --> 03:38:42.921]  The neo-Nazis who overthrew the government?
[03:38:44.101 --> 03:38:47.002]  They were gonna bring democracy over there!
[03:38:47.242 --> 03:38:48.602]  Hey, you heard that line before?
[03:38:48.902 --> 03:38:50.043]  Oh yeah, you're hearing it now!
[03:38:50.703 --> 03:38:50.943]  Again.
[03:38:51.727 --> 03:38:55.868]  Look at what Trump is doing with Venezuela and Pompeo and Bolton.
[03:38:55.908 --> 03:38:57.349]  Talking about bringing democracy.
[03:38:57.769 --> 03:38:58.629]  How about the oil?
[03:38:59.810 --> 03:39:02.011]  Anyway, going back to Ukraine.
[03:39:02.031 --> 03:39:05.672]  You're putting that guy Poroshenko, right?
[03:39:05.692 --> 03:39:08.473]  They had an election yesterday.
[03:39:09.673 --> 03:39:10.834]  This is before the election.
[03:39:12.714 --> 03:39:15.675]  9% of Ukrainians have confidence in their government. 9%!
[03:39:21.053 --> 03:39:22.273]  Nine percent.
[03:39:23.494 --> 03:39:23.954]  All right?
[03:39:24.594 --> 03:39:27.075]  I'm not good at math, but I can count to ten.
[03:39:29.016 --> 03:39:30.156]  Nine percent.
[03:39:33.237 --> 03:39:33.958]  That many.
[03:39:36.058 --> 03:39:38.559]  And a government that the United States put in there.
[03:39:38.579 --> 03:39:40.160]  So they had an election yesterday.
[03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:41.740]  Oh, they did?
[03:39:42.641 --> 03:39:43.781]  And who won the election?
[03:39:44.481 --> 03:39:47.082]  Well, you know who won the election, don't you?
[03:39:48.743 --> 03:39:49.243]  A comic.
[03:39:51.311 --> 03:39:51.831]  That's right.
[03:39:52.432 --> 03:39:54.493]  A clown won the election.
[03:39:55.634 --> 03:39:57.075]  They got a runoff coming on.
[03:39:58.156 --> 03:40:02.779]  But a clown ran and won the election.
[03:40:03.320 --> 03:40:05.461]  And it's no different than in the United States.
[03:40:06.902 --> 03:40:08.404]  Because what do we have over here?
[03:40:09.584 --> 03:40:15.849]  Do I care what Morlon Mayor Bill Mayer has to say?
[03:40:18.011 --> 03:40:19.672]  Or the other clowns, Kimmel,
[03:40:21.277 --> 03:40:24.518]  And they're reported every day what comics have to say?
[03:40:25.338 --> 03:40:27.898]  And that's all Saturday Night Live has become.
[03:40:29.259 --> 03:40:36.580]  Comics have become political, as my good friend Robert Ferrucci often reminds me.
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:39.101]  Not funny politics.
[03:40:41.301 --> 03:40:42.741]  One-sided politics.
[03:40:45.142 --> 03:40:47.082]  That's what the nation's sunk down to.
[03:40:48.162 --> 03:40:50.443]  And that's what's happened, clearly,
[03:40:51.391 --> 03:40:54.232]  As well, in Ukraine.
[03:40:55.333 --> 03:40:56.033]  A comic.
[03:40:57.054 --> 03:40:59.355]  A comic is in the lead.
[03:40:59.975 --> 03:41:01.876]  And, name the country!
[03:41:02.677 --> 03:41:04.478]  And you got the comic leading them!
[03:41:04.498 --> 03:41:05.258]  Hey!
[03:41:05.939 --> 03:41:07.680]  How about May over there, huh?
[03:41:08.100 --> 03:41:08.620]  Maybe?
[03:41:09.221 --> 03:41:10.421]  Over there in the UK?
[03:41:10.862 --> 03:41:13.403]  Hey, to the people who voted for Brexit!
[03:41:13.823 --> 03:41:15.864]  We don't care what your vote is!
[03:41:16.445 --> 03:41:17.845]  You don't matter to us!
[03:41:18.466 --> 03:41:23.969]  So what, you had a referendum, and a majority said you wanted to leave the European Union.
[03:41:24.329 --> 03:41:26.430]  The majority vote doesn't count.
[03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:34.214]  We'll tell you what to do, just like they did over there in Greece, when the people voted against the austerity measures.
[03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:35.711]  Screw you!
[03:41:35.771 --> 03:41:39.153]  We're not gonna... We'll do you what you want.
[03:41:39.213 --> 03:41:40.293]  We'll tell you.
[03:41:40.634 --> 03:41:41.914]  We're the politicians.
[03:41:43.155 --> 03:41:44.276]  Name the country.
[03:41:44.796 --> 03:41:47.018]  Macron, the little cotton.
[03:41:47.658 --> 03:41:49.959]  A little boy had nothing over there in France.
[03:41:51.761 --> 03:41:55.423]  And here we are in the United States going into the presidential reality show.
[03:41:56.724 --> 03:41:58.084]  And it's a cast, boy.
[03:41:59.545 --> 03:42:01.186]  Well, girl, I gotta be proper now.
[03:42:01.206 --> 03:42:03.748]  I don't want anybody to say, you said boy, and he didn't say girl.
[03:42:05.540 --> 03:42:11.581]  But talking about that, how about the big news about, uh, Joe Biden, huh?
[03:42:12.401 --> 03:42:17.022]  Now, if I were to rate politicians on 1 to 10, where I put Biden, I'd put about a minus 15.
[03:42:18.202 --> 03:42:19.402]  I can't stand the guy.
[03:42:20.003 --> 03:42:22.563]  A phony piece of arrogant garbage.
[03:42:23.763 --> 03:42:24.483]  But what happened?
[03:42:25.664 --> 03:42:27.684]  Made an accusation about him.
[03:42:27.704 --> 03:42:28.164]  That's right.
[03:42:30.464 --> 03:42:33.745]  You could say anything, prove nothing,
[03:42:35.014 --> 03:42:35.634]  And you're guilty.
[03:42:36.774 --> 03:42:40.815]  That's where America's become, and that's how dumbed down the media's become.
[03:42:41.535 --> 03:42:42.736]  This isn't journalism.
[03:42:43.456 --> 03:42:44.516]  You made an allegation.
[03:42:44.556 --> 03:42:45.336]  Show me some proof.
[03:42:46.977 --> 03:42:47.937]  No, don't have to.
[03:42:48.877 --> 03:42:52.178]  Because we're the prostitutes, and we get paid to put out.
[03:42:52.198 --> 03:42:56.939]  But now that info wars, we're going to be back in a few minutes.
[03:42:57.679 --> 03:43:00.439]  Stay tuned, more trends coming up.
[03:43:09.267 --> 03:43:12.028]  And let's go to Lucas in North Carolina.
[03:43:12.048 --> 03:43:13.149]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:43:13.169 --> 03:43:13.789]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:43:13.829 --> 03:43:14.349]  Good to be on.
[03:43:14.369 --> 03:43:15.089]  Good to have you here.
[03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:19.531]  Real quickly, I just wanted to say that I am a user of the InfoWars products.
[03:43:19.771 --> 03:43:22.052]  First, I started with Supermail Vitality.
[03:43:22.072 --> 03:43:29.715]  I am a late 30s male, and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as much as I do, and immediately noticed that
[03:43:30.015 --> 03:43:35.496]  Being able to retain strength and muscle mass from the use of super male vitality, so I want to thank you for that.
[03:43:35.636 --> 03:43:41.657]  Also, I bought the t-shirt, Reelect 45, and Hillary for Prison, obviously, one of the most popular.
[03:43:41.677 --> 03:43:46.778]  It's drawn so much attention, and I don't know if people believe it or not, but it's all positive attention.
[03:43:46.858 --> 03:43:53.299]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old and middle-aged black women.
[03:43:53.379 --> 03:43:56.800]  Honest to God, they were the ones commenting, saying, I love that shirt.
[03:43:56.860 --> 03:43:59.320]  They would laugh about it, tell their friends about it.
[03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:11.167]  And, uh, next, I tried X2, and, uh, it's nothing that you notice immediately, but it seemed over time, I felt like I was more sharp from the iodine, being able to retain a short-term memory better.
[03:44:11.207 --> 03:44:14.329]  I just feel a little sharper in my day-to-day activities.
[03:44:15.390 --> 03:44:16.191]  I totally agree with you.
[03:44:16.211 --> 03:44:18.112]  Again, it's the good halogen.
[03:44:18.312 --> 03:44:21.394]  IQs get reduced by 15 points without iodine.
[03:44:21.474 --> 03:44:23.436]  In your development, people can look this up for themselves.
[03:44:23.876 --> 03:44:28.199]  And that's why the globalists are obsessed with making sure it's not in the food, it's not in the products we eat.
[03:44:28.599 --> 03:44:30.160]  We are just starving for iodine.
[03:44:30.200 --> 03:44:31.221]  That's why we came out with X2.
[03:44:31.261 --> 03:44:32.182]  We have X3.
[03:44:32.222 --> 03:44:34.563]  That's all three times, but this is the deep-earth crystal source.
[03:44:34.624 --> 03:44:35.884]  We don't have it back in stock.
[03:44:35.964 --> 03:44:38.066]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:38.246 --> 03:44:40.488]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub-page.
[03:44:40.508 --> 03:44:42.329]  That has all the award-winning supplements.
[03:44:42.449 --> 03:44:46.152]  And while you're there getting the supplements, go check out the hundreds of great t-shirts.
[03:44:46.232 --> 03:44:47.853]  Many of them are limited edition.
[03:44:47.973 --> 03:44:48.553]  It's all there.
[03:44:48.733 --> 03:44:52.576]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:52.876 --> 03:45:05.225]  If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed.
[03:45:05.625 --> 03:45:07.146]  If you do read it, you're misinformed.
[03:45:10.970 --> 03:45:11.931]  That's a great question.
[03:45:12.211 --> 03:45:14.394]  What is the long-term effect of too much information?
[03:45:15.215 --> 03:45:18.258]  One of the effects is the need to be first, not even to be true anymore.
[03:45:18.699 --> 03:45:28.930]  We are hearing from a Native American elder, a Vietnam War veteran, speaking to CNN after a disturbing viral video shows a group of teens harassing and mocking him in the nation's capital.
[03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:31.032]  The videos have drawn outrage.
[03:45:31.112 --> 03:45:31.512]  Outrage.
[03:45:31.612 --> 03:45:31.973]  Outrage.
[03:45:32.073 --> 03:45:32.473]  Outrage.
[03:45:32.573 --> 03:45:33.994]  Outrage from all corners.
[03:45:34.034 --> 03:45:36.356]  Here's the video sparking outrage on social media.
[03:45:36.376 --> 03:45:38.258]  Sparked outrage on social media.
[03:45:38.298 --> 03:45:46.065]  A group of teenagers, many wearing Make America Great Again hats, were caught on video taunting a Native American Vietnam veteran.
[03:45:46.265 --> 03:45:48.247]  So what a responsibility you all have.
[03:45:49.505 --> 03:45:50.827]  To be, to tell the truth.
[03:45:51.428 --> 03:45:53.691]  Not just to be first, but to tell the truth.
[03:45:53.952 --> 03:45:58.518]  A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are.
[03:45:58.899 --> 03:46:00.381]  They are the enemy of the people.
[03:46:01.383 --> 03:46:05.349]  Because they have no sources, they just make them up.
[03:46:06.314 --> 03:46:06.995]  When there are none.
[03:46:07.215 --> 03:46:09.096]  We live in a society now where it's just first.
[03:46:09.156 --> 03:46:09.657]  Who cares?
[03:46:09.897 --> 03:46:10.517]  Get it out there.
[03:46:10.878 --> 03:46:11.798]  We don't care who it hurts.
[03:46:11.858 --> 03:46:12.939]  We don't care who we destroy.
[03:46:13.079 --> 03:46:14.060]  We don't care if it's true.
[03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:14.921]  Just say it.
[03:46:15.001 --> 03:46:15.401]  Sell it.
[03:46:15.661 --> 03:46:18.723]  The President of the United States is racist.
[03:46:18.844 --> 03:46:22.306]  The President of the United States is a weak man.
[03:46:22.366 --> 03:46:23.187]  He's a racist.
[03:46:23.487 --> 03:46:24.108]  He's a punk.
[03:46:24.668 --> 03:46:25.369]  He's a dog.
[03:46:25.669 --> 03:46:26.369]  He's a pig.
[03:46:26.409 --> 03:46:27.710]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[03:46:27.890 --> 03:46:29.131]  He's unfit to be human.
[03:46:29.632 --> 03:46:31.273]  Anything you practice, you'll get good at.
[03:46:32.854 --> 03:46:33.315]  Including BS.
[03:46:38.371 --> 03:46:39.472]  We've got some breaking news.
[03:46:39.692 --> 03:46:46.516]  Actor and musician Jussie Smollett from the hit show Empire was attacked and beaten early this morning in Chicago.
[03:46:46.556 --> 03:46:48.077]  Racism is alive and well.
[03:46:48.117 --> 03:46:51.359]  And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.
[03:46:51.540 --> 03:46:53.501]  The fact that we have these fear mongrels.
[03:46:53.741 --> 03:46:58.924]  These people that are trying to separate us and it's just not okay.
[03:47:01.906 --> 03:47:02.727]  Did I make that up too?
[03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:08.757]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.511 --> 03:47:28.112]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:28.432 --> 03:47:37.337]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilenti.
[03:47:37.457 --> 03:47:38.278]  Hey, welcome back.
[03:47:38.338 --> 03:47:40.339]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:40.359 --> 03:47:43.281]  This is Gerald Cilenti hosting this hour.
[03:47:44.021 --> 03:47:45.422]  It's always great being here.
[03:47:45.442 --> 03:47:49.364]  Remember, put your money where your mind is and your heart.
[03:47:50.025 --> 03:47:55.488]  Support InfoWars to keep freedom of speech alive because they're really taking it away from us.
[03:47:56.363 --> 03:48:02.264]  There was this article I was looking at, you know, the Chinese or how they're putting more and more censorship on.
[03:48:02.284 --> 03:48:05.725]  I'm saying, man, America's catching right up there with them.
[03:48:07.485 --> 03:48:10.326]  So support InfoWars anyway, where you can.
[03:48:11.086 --> 03:48:15.787]  Again, I read you that article about how there's a lawsuit against Poland Spring.
[03:48:16.827 --> 03:48:18.288]  It's not spring water at all.
[03:48:18.368 --> 03:48:19.168]  I'm not saying it.
[03:48:19.208 --> 03:48:20.268]  That's what the lawsuit is.
[03:48:20.308 --> 03:48:22.428]  So don't come after me, Mr. Nestle.
[03:48:23.148 --> 03:48:25.509]  I think they're the ones that own Poland Spring.
[03:48:26.618 --> 03:48:29.519]  And I was mentioning also about Joe Biden.
[03:48:29.559 --> 03:48:31.239]  Again, a disgusting human being.
[03:48:31.599 --> 03:48:32.740]  Can't stand the guy.
[03:48:32.760 --> 03:48:34.720]  He's a phony fraud.
[03:48:34.980 --> 03:48:35.420]  Arrogant.
[03:48:35.900 --> 03:48:37.401]  Never worked a day in his life.
[03:48:37.441 --> 03:48:40.922]  He's been playing his... He's been a lifelong politician.
[03:48:40.982 --> 03:48:41.982]  Another one of those.
[03:48:42.002 --> 03:48:44.282]  Oh, I'm sorry I did that.
[03:48:44.402 --> 03:48:45.843]  I'm sorry I did that.
[03:48:46.203 --> 03:48:55.105]  I regret I did that, because now I'm running... I may run for office, so I'm gonna backtrack on all the miserable things I did to make people's lives so disgusting.
[03:48:56.049 --> 03:49:12.561]  But anyway, when he was accused of blowing on the hair, or breathing on the hair of a woman, and then kissing her in the back of the head, that happened, what, 2015?
[03:49:13.762 --> 03:49:14.682]  Four years ago.
[03:49:15.323 --> 03:49:16.924]  Oh, I was terrified, I couldn't say anything.
[03:49:17.224 --> 03:49:22.948]  If that was my mother, may I so rest in peace, running in my aunts, they were like, you son of a... What the hell are you doing?
[03:49:22.988 --> 03:49:24.029]  Get the hell out of here!
[03:49:25.247 --> 03:49:26.948]  They could care less who it was.
[03:49:27.969 --> 03:49:28.649]  Oh, no.
[03:49:29.290 --> 03:49:30.851]  I couldn't say anything.
[03:49:31.391 --> 03:49:32.652]  Oh, you know, that's right.
[03:49:32.692 --> 03:49:34.013]  She was running for office.
[03:49:34.513 --> 03:49:36.715]  She was the perfect politician, man.
[03:49:37.495 --> 03:49:37.975]  Women.
[03:49:38.716 --> 03:49:49.623]  Anyway, again, one of our top trends in the Trends Journal this year, 2019, was America Puritan 2.0.
[03:49:50.444 --> 03:49:51.724]  This is more of the proof.
[03:49:53.125 --> 03:49:53.946]  Say anything.
[03:49:55.140 --> 03:49:59.223]  Prove nothing, and you are guilty!
[03:50:00.905 --> 03:50:03.547]  Anybody could... That's not journalism!
[03:50:04.828 --> 03:50:13.415]  And that's why subscribe to the Trends Journal, because that's journalism, if you want the current events forming future trends.
[03:50:13.775 --> 03:50:15.376]  Support InfoWars.
[03:50:17.018 --> 03:50:23.603]  Support the media where people take a stand and aren't told what to do.
[03:50:24.821 --> 03:50:26.141]  Like the prostitutes do.
[03:50:27.242 --> 03:50:32.143]  That's such a disgusting story, and there's so many more important things going on.
[03:50:32.623 --> 03:50:38.064]  And one of them, put your money where your mind is, on those markets, huh?
[03:50:38.084 --> 03:50:39.345]  They're up 300 points.
[03:50:40.425 --> 03:50:40.945]  That's right.
[03:50:43.506 --> 03:50:46.626]  This is some quarter that this is starting out to.
[03:50:49.727 --> 03:50:49.867]  U.S.
[03:50:49.907 --> 03:50:53.088]  manufacturing activity expanded last month.
[03:50:54.235 --> 03:50:58.198]  Rebounding from its lowest level since late 2016.
[03:51:01.180 --> 03:51:05.383]  Over there in China, they had a good time too.
[03:51:06.824 --> 03:51:15.529]  Their Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index jumped 50.8 in March.
[03:51:16.090 --> 03:51:17.391]  Over 50 means growth.
[03:51:19.012 --> 03:51:20.613]  And that's the highest level in eight months.
[03:51:23.404 --> 03:51:24.184]  And it was down.
[03:51:24.224 --> 03:51:25.425]  They expected it to be at 49.9.
[03:51:25.505 --> 03:51:34.130]  So, China is also pushing stimulus in there.
[03:51:36.031 --> 03:51:42.915]  Last Wednesday, we sent our subscribers a trend alert.
[03:51:44.676 --> 03:51:45.196]  That's right.
[03:51:48.017 --> 03:51:49.058]  Fed can't wait.
[03:51:49.698 --> 03:51:50.559]  Needs to move.
[03:51:51.863 --> 03:51:56.166]  Beyond the accelerating global economic slowdown, we forecast a weakening U.S.
[03:51:56.586 --> 03:52:04.131]  gross domestic product, which we still do, and lower corporate earnings, which we still do, that will require the U.S.
[03:52:04.151 --> 03:52:11.195]  Federal Reserve to lower interest rates now before economic conditions markedly deteriorate.
[03:52:15.438 --> 03:52:16.278]  And then what happened?
[03:52:19.560 --> 03:52:21.041]  We sent that out on Wednesday.
[03:52:22.301 --> 03:52:36.291]  Larry Kudlow, President Trump's chief economic advisor, recommended lowering interest rates now.
[03:52:37.132 --> 03:52:37.712]  That's right.
[03:52:38.553 --> 03:52:44.117]  I guess he reads our Trends Alerts and subscribes to the Trends Journal, because we said it first.
[03:52:44.857 --> 03:52:46.278]  It's right there in print.
[03:52:47.900 --> 03:52:49.661]  They have to lower rates now.
[03:52:51.496 --> 03:53:00.899]  The rest of the world doesn't have that capacity, because much of the world, like Europe, is in negative interest rate territory, as is Japan.
[03:53:01.980 --> 03:53:03.500]  And Europe is slowing down.
[03:53:04.440 --> 03:53:08.782]  And over there in China, they only could do so much stimulus.
[03:53:09.582 --> 03:53:12.003]  They got a $40 trillion debt bubble.
[03:53:14.724 --> 03:53:16.545]  And now things are slowing down there.
[03:53:16.585 --> 03:53:20.386]  Yeah, this number came out, it's a bit positive, but there are a lot of negatives.
[03:53:22.014 --> 03:53:27.396]  So in order for this economy to move forward, you have to see interest rates go down.
[03:53:27.416 --> 03:53:30.637]  Am I saying they should go down?
[03:53:30.737 --> 03:53:31.077]  No.
[03:53:31.677 --> 03:53:32.957]  We're trend forecasters.
[03:53:34.038 --> 03:53:40.540]  When we make a statement as to, for example, we don't take a side on the border wall, we put out the issues.
[03:53:42.500 --> 03:53:46.522]  Am I personally in favor of not bringing more illegal immigrants in?
[03:53:46.862 --> 03:53:47.322]  Yes.
[03:53:48.622 --> 03:53:50.383]  But we leave it to the people.
[03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:53.932]  Have a referendum on the economy.
[03:53:55.132 --> 03:53:55.813]  Same thing.
[03:53:56.453 --> 03:54:00.515]  I called for an economic 9-11 when interest rates are going to go up.
[03:54:01.576 --> 03:54:04.837]  And they signal they would go up two to three times in 2019.
[03:54:05.938 --> 03:54:13.802]  Back in September 2018, you saw the markets fall to their worst December they had since the Great Depression.
[03:54:14.977 --> 03:54:21.860]  And I made the forecast of an economic 9-11 the day before, September 19th, the day before the S&P 500 peaked.
[03:54:24.361 --> 03:54:26.102]  So we go with the trends.
[03:54:27.142 --> 03:54:29.203]  We're not holding on to an ideology.
[03:54:30.423 --> 03:54:36.406]  So we were the first, when I was on Alex Jones Show, to call the Trump rally in 2016.
[03:54:36.446 --> 03:54:38.006]  We were the first in February 2018
[03:54:45.162 --> 03:54:47.384]  To call for a market correction last year.
[03:54:48.545 --> 03:54:56.531]  And we were the first, this January, to call the Trump bump.
[03:54:57.352 --> 03:54:58.653]  No recession.
[03:54:59.834 --> 03:55:08.701]  But they know that things are slowing down, and that's why Larry Kudlow came out and said, we gotta lower rates.
[03:55:09.161 --> 03:55:09.842]  And he's correct.
[03:55:10.562 --> 03:55:12.804]  We have to lower them because we also say,
[03:55:13.564 --> 03:55:27.135]  Should the Federal Reserve rely on its data-based formula and fail to lower rates ahead of negative trend indicators, we forecast a rapid economic and equity market downward spiral.
[03:55:28.036 --> 03:55:30.097]  You go back and you look at the facts.
[03:55:32.579 --> 03:55:34.321]  They've been late on it all the time.
[03:55:35.481 --> 03:55:38.424]  Bernanke never saw the recession coming when he was Fed Chair.
[03:55:38.444 --> 03:55:41.186]  The numbers are there, the words are there, the facts are there.
[03:55:43.069 --> 03:55:51.115]  So gold prices are going down now, and they're stuck in that range, and you heard me say, maybe six years.
[03:55:51.135 --> 03:55:57.539]  They're only going to rise in times when it has to be a safe haven asset.
[03:55:58.240 --> 03:56:00.141]  And right now, we're not in that territory.
[03:56:01.021 --> 03:56:03.663]  So the bottom of gold, as we see it, is $1,200.
[03:56:04.264 --> 03:56:08.206]  Has to break above $1,385 for it to push forward.
[03:56:09.087 --> 03:56:10.708]  And when it pushes forward, it has to break $1,450.
[03:56:12.438 --> 03:56:14.400]  $1,450 an ounce.
[03:56:15.020 --> 03:56:20.845]  When it breaks that mark, again, I've been saying this for six years, then it's going to go to $2,000.
[03:56:21.765 --> 03:56:22.546]  Hasn't done that.
[03:56:22.946 --> 03:56:26.649]  We've been right on target with our forecasts.
[03:56:28.150 --> 03:56:31.673]  Average Americans can't afford a home in 70% of the country.
[03:56:32.794 --> 03:56:37.218]  There's going to be the issue in this coming election, income inequality.
[03:56:37.958 --> 03:56:41.461]  I told you it was going on over there in Algeria.
[03:56:42.978 --> 03:56:45.440]  What's going on in Ukraine?
[03:56:46.361 --> 03:56:48.763]  It's one country after another.
[03:56:49.904 --> 03:56:51.886]  Income inequality.
[03:56:54.188 --> 03:56:57.291]  So that's going to be the major issue.
[03:57:00.074 --> 03:57:02.436]  And now you're looking at oil prices going up.
[03:57:04.278 --> 03:57:08.702]  If oil prices go up too high, you're already seeing a push down in retail sales.
[03:57:10.066 --> 03:57:20.970]  If oil prices break above $75 a barrel, and now they're around $70, $69 and change for Brent crude, that's going to be pressure on the economy.
[03:57:22.631 --> 03:57:27.253]  So, stay tuned to the current events forming future trends.
[03:57:27.973 --> 03:57:33.795]  Don't get caught up in the junk news that they're pushing out on the mainstream media.
[03:57:36.356 --> 03:57:37.517]  It's very important.
[03:57:39.445 --> 03:57:40.706]  It's volatile times.
[03:57:41.586 --> 03:57:50.912]  So to stay ahead of the trends and on top of the news, stay tuned to InfoWars and also consider subscribing to the Trends Journal.
[03:57:53.968 --> 03:57:58.431]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:58.652 --> 03:58:03.335]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:58:03.956 --> 03:58:09.800]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:58:10.200 --> 03:58:22.810]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you have to absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:23.570 --> 03:58:32.215]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law Family Code.
[03:58:32.235 --> 03:58:34.156]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:58:34.497 --> 03:58:35.597]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:58:35.617 --> 03:58:36.918]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:58:37.098 --> 03:58:38.299]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:58:38.659 --> 03:58:39.980]  Man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:58:40.480 --> 03:58:42.121]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:58:42.422 --> 03:58:43.903]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:58:44.263 --> 03:58:46.865]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:58:46.885 --> 03:58:47.745]  This is insane.
[03:58:48.165 --> 03:58:49.786]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:58:50.047 --> 03:58:52.588]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:58:53.049 --> 03:58:56.431]  He says, this is totally free, but he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:58:56.451 --> 03:58:59.753]  And I said, it's the synergy of it, of the camo
