[00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:21.370]  And that's why I would not just shut up and dribble because I mean too much to my two boys here, my wife, my family, and all these other kids that look up to me for inspiration.
[00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:28.894]  You are good!
[00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:35.299]  You told the Rockets that they're uneducated and stupid!
[00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.743]  With Daryl Moret, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand.
[00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:42.565]  And he spoke.
[00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:45.867]  And so many people could have been harmed.
[00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.230]  Not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.
[00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.454]  Like the manager of the Rockets that said that Hong Kong deserved freedom.
[00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:56.996]  No, that did people hurt.
[00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.077]  I can tell you've been watching my broadcast.
[00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:07.741]  That is how you refer to the Americans as stupid, uneducated.
[00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.222]  LeBron James knows best.
[00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:14.664]  And now some evil Americans have said that he is bad.
[00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:17.526]  So he has said that he will no longer speak.
[00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:18.546]  Yes!
[00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:19.467]  Yes!
[00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:23.168]  I'm talking about it now, and I won't talk about it again.
[00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:23.809]  LeBron!
[00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.330]  Shut up and dribble.
[00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.453]  Oh, LeBron James has a mandate of heaven now.
[00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:39.198]  And finally this evening, I have a very special announcement to make to you stupid Americans.
[00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:54.082]  Winnie the Pooh was illegal, but now after a long period of re-education, he is now ready to carry out his new job with a slave, I mean, good helper-servant.
[00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:58.983]  Here is LeBron James at the latest exhibition game, M.P.
[00:01:59.023 --> 00:01:59.483]  King.
[00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:05.085]  We have issued directives to NBA what they ought to say.
[00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.625]  Hold on, I'm getting calls.
[00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:07.786]  Yes, what?
[00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:11.382]  Shaquille O'Neal say what?
[00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:14.283]  Show me, let me see.
[00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:17.423]  One of our best values here in America is free speech.
[00:02:17.443 --> 00:02:22.145]  We're allowed to say what we want to say, and we're allowed to speak up about injustices.
[00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:23.625]  And that's just how it goes.
[00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.887]  And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with.
[00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:33.808]  Tamata need me going to Shaquille O'Neal!
[00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:39.826]  And we will teach you soon!
[00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.128]  Our antifa is preparing to rise up!
[00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:46.489]  With Deep State, we have paid well!
[00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.771]  And to give you a visit, ma'am, doesn't help!
[00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:52.832]  We'll have to kill you!
[00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:59.356]  You live and work in a state in which the majority of voters voted for the current president.
[00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:03.678]  How do you reconcile having called that choice a mistake?
[00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:06.219]  That many of those people are also Cavaliers fans.
[00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:10.197]  Well, I mean, that's a great question.
[00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:24.316]  At the end of the day, like I said, you can... I don't think a lot of people was educated.
[00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.598]  I just caught you, American!
[00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:32.999]  You visited Bandar Video!
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.162]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[00:03:37.703 --> 00:03:43.047]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video or I have to hurt you!
