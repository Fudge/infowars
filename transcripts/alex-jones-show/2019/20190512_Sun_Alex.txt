[00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:08.636]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:14.361]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:31.435]  Well, I told you that we learned from internal documents six months ago at PayPal, after 20 years of business with us, and us, that we've been listed as international terrorists.
[00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:35.158]  It's a hazard or danger designation.
[00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:44.962]  That means you're a convicted murderer, child trafficker, child molester, international terrorist, criminal.
[00:00:46.263 --> 00:01:03.689]  And now you saw, eight days ago, Facebook banned myself, Paul Watson, from people even talking about us in a positive light, saying that we're, quote, dangerous, and they listed in the same order what I got internally from what's filed by private corporations into Interpol and the banks.
[00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.481]  So this is the whole future for everyone.
[00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:21.238]  Actual governments and corporations terrorizing people with perfect credit scores, in no criminal records, the end of due process, the end of free speech.
[00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:24.222]  They are the terrorists when they do this.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.129]  And it is just incredible how they build the pretext on a fake article about an anti-Semitic article we supposedly posted.
[00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:36.375]  Then you read it and it says, oh, 4% of the comments were anti-Semitic.
[00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:39.058]  So by that yardstick, anybody could just randomly...
[00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:47.459]  Go to your Facebook post, type a few anti-Jew comments in, and you'd be banned from the Internet, banned from banking, banned from life.
[00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.280]  There's no judge, there's no jury, there's no executioner.
[00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:58.285]  These aren't private companies, these are multinational combines working in unison to defraud people of their basic rights, and it's going to come to an end.
[00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:00.587]  It's going to be defeated.
[00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:08.852]  Worldwide, there's what they're calling a constitutional convention with Zuckerberg, with the whole world
[00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:11.293]  We're good to go.
[00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:43.051]  Where the CHICOMS and the EU and the leftists in Hollywood can come in and can create their own system and obliterate free speech.
[00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:48.855]  And you're watching it happen right now in front of everyone.
[00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:53.959]  And it's ahead of big events that are already taking place and set to take place.
[00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:59.703]  So I'm not going to spend a lot of time today on the draconian, out of control, historically massive
[00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:03.199]  Coordinated censorship that's going on.
[00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:12.864]  I'm gonna get into just the other crises unfolding and taking place around the world, but here it even is in CNBC.
[00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:19.227]  YouTube and its users face an existential threat from the EU's new copyright directive.
[00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:26.230]  And their directive is everything has to be pre-approved by the EU before you show it.
[00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.171]  Well, that's impossible.
[00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:28.735]  Ian's free speech.
[00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:30.076]  It's prior restraint.
[00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:39.178]  Matt Drudge came here three and a half years ago and warned specifically of this, because that was the plan told to him by a Supreme Court Justice that had been briefed about what the EU was planning.
[00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:42.659]  Instead of America saying no to this, we just go, oh, EU, you're the boss.
[00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.460]  Or CHICOMS, you're the boss, we'll let this happen.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.742]  So, big tech is deciding to fold a world government, and remember Obama wanted to turn the internet over to the UN?
[00:03:53.991 --> 00:03:56.032]  His last year in office was only partially done.
[00:03:56.692 --> 00:03:58.252]  That's what this really all is.
[00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:13.417]  And the globalists have very intelligently instead made it about censoring a few nationalist, populist, right-wing figures who have rung the alarm about this, who have raised the alarm, who have been at the forefront of exposing the system.
[00:04:14.038 --> 00:04:15.118]  And so they demonize us.
[00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:26.083]  To try to create a false image of us, and then they move forward to make the issue about censoring us, who've now been, through alchemy, transformed from patriots into devils, in the minds of some.
[00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:34.954]  And then while the general public's hiding like sheep or a school of fish, hoping they're not the next to be grabbed, everyone's losing their rights.
[00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:40.094]  At the same time, it's diabolical, but it's the way tyranny works.
[00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:42.895]  But we're not going to cover that when we come back.
[00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:56.742]  No, my friends, the crisis in the Middle East with Iran, the aircraft carriers, the weapons massing, how that ties into other geopolitical issues, how it ties into the trade war with China, and so much more.
[00:04:57.102 --> 00:04:58.243]  We're covering that first.
[00:04:58.623 --> 00:05:00.644]  World in Crisis on the other side.
[00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.700]  If you're a new listener, just type in...
[00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:24.846]  Whack your brain permanently!
[00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:26.408]  Brain chips and the trips!
[00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:31.673]  They give the trips special vaccines that are really nanotech that already re-engineer their brains.
[00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:33.475]  Now there it is, the gay bomb.
[00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:34.596]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:37.219]  I mean, this is what they're... What do you think tap water is?
[00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.480]  It's a gay bomb, baby!
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.763]  And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings.
[00:05:42.064 --> 00:05:43.745]  I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly.
[00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:44.887]  I mean, give me a break!
[00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:50.187]  Some up here bashing it because I don't like gay people.
[00:05:50.508 --> 00:05:54.417]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay!
[00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:09.912]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:20.257]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.077 --> 00:06:25.459]  You can feel it.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.600]  You can see it.
[00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:30.862]  You can scientifically quantify it.
[00:06:34.023 --> 00:06:35.724]  It's the animating contest of liberty.
[00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:38.524]  It's taking place and it's happening right now.
[00:06:39.385 --> 00:06:40.506]  It's Sunday, May 12, 2019.
[00:06:41.247 --> 00:06:43.609]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:45.810]  We're live and broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:48.172]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:50.114]  I'm very honored to have you joining us.
[00:06:50.134 --> 00:06:52.456]  I know a lot of you have to jump through hoops to find us.
[00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:55.598]  There's a lot of censorship and authoritarianism taking place.
[00:06:56.179 --> 00:07:04.426]  There's an ongoing civil war in the West to try to take our countries back from the unelected, globalist, CHICOM-financed world government.
[00:07:05.478 --> 00:07:12.841]  But when we win and when we succeed, and we are and we will completely win in the end, that's how it always works.
[00:07:14.862 --> 00:07:16.603]  We will then count the score.
[00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:19.364]  But now we just press forward.
[00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:20.705]  Okay.
[00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:30.344]  There have been massive developments on the Russiagate front, and folks know that I'm sick of Russiagate.
[00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:32.465]  I've been in the middle of Russiagate for three years.
[00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:38.847]  It's a total fraud the way the Democrats have pushed it and said it, but they themselves have been up to their eyeballs in it.
[00:07:40.648 --> 00:07:44.569]  And now as it comes out that Joe Biden and others
[00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:59.487]  Sold out to Russia, sold out to China, sold out to Ukraine, and have been caught in all of the hand in the cookie jar, open and shut case, caught red-handed.
[00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.170]  Information has come out.
[00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.391]  They are getting really, really scared.
[00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.074]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:08:08.575 --> 00:08:10.716]  And then people like Schiff,
[00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:34.441]  The House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff, has the gall, I'll cover this next segment, to come out and say you cannot investigate any Democrats for Ukraine or Russia or China, because if you noticed, almost every top Democrat, a lot of them involved in this, that's the Democratic Party, is a globalist, anti-American, sell America out party.
[00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:37.123]  I mean, that's America was never great, it'll never be great.
[00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.225]  All of them have been complicitly involved in the cover-up.
[00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.060]  Except maybe the Congresswoman out of Hawaii.
[00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:47.741]  Or Beto.
[00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:50.702]  So they don't know what to do.
[00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:52.763]  And I guess AOC.
[00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:54.164]  But most of them have been.
[00:08:54.704 --> 00:09:02.348]  And so Schiff is now saying that no one can investigate a Democrat for anything because it's election time.
[00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:04.749]  And that's election meddling.
[00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.890]  And it's for political purposes.
[00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.472]  While the Democrats have launched, they said it was going to be
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.520]  22 new investigations.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.642]  It's 12 so far with all of the subpoenas and all the harassment.
[00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:27.385]  So you talk about waging war on reality, common sense, beyond hypocrisy.
[00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:40.429]  We're going to go after all of you politically on things that you've been found not guilty of, but you can't investigate anything we're doing because it would be political when we have them dead to rights.
[00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:45.226]  The arrogance of these individuals is only outpaced by their evil.
[00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:54.474]  And of course, that's just because they've been living in a free country so long that their crimes have gone unpunished.
[00:09:54.494 --> 00:10:02.461]  They believe that they are free the bounds of reality and free the bounds of justice.
[00:10:03.382 --> 00:10:03.922]  But they're not.
[00:10:03.982 --> 00:10:04.683]  You know, it's funny.
[00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:05.644]  Trump actually tweeted
[00:10:06.963 --> 00:10:19.474]  A short video this weekend, the President did, by Michael Pillsburg, where he said, globalists live in their own universe, think tariffs are satanic.
[00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:21.776]  We're going to get to that here in a moment.
[00:10:21.816 --> 00:10:24.979]  But they live in their own universe on so many fronts.
[00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:27.621]  But let's now get right into the big issues.
[00:10:30.706 --> 00:10:31.387]  I don't want war.
[00:10:32.307 --> 00:10:47.038]  I was against the first Iraq war and the second Iraq war and Afghanistan and I don't want to really go into Venezuela because I don't trust the neocons not to put a puppet in and create a new crisis because they want a strategy of ongoing tension along with the Democrats.
[00:10:47.198 --> 00:10:48.399]  I trust the president though.
[00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:52.402]  You have thousands starving to death a week, hundreds being killed.
[00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:53.262]  It's a nightmare.
[00:10:53.322 --> 00:10:54.283]  It's on our doorstep.
[00:10:54.903 --> 00:10:55.604]  It's a problem.
[00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:58.026]  So I'd like to see Maduro go.
[00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:00.446]  But I don't want to see a U.S.
[00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:02.187]  invasion and troops getting killed.
[00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:13.591]  But with the case of Iran, we have a country that actually does have terror cells all over the country and all over the world.
[00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:14.411]  Hezbollah.
[00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:29.162]  And we have a nation that has built up a lot of high-tech weapons since then that's constantly threatening to attack us provocatively, constantly grabbing US ships, grabbing other ships, threatening to close different ports.
[00:11:30.783 --> 00:11:34.164]  And this situation is barreling towards
[00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:36.310]  Confrontation.
[00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.630]  U.S.
[00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.132]  sends assault ship missiles to Mideast.
[00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:40.292]  Submit Iran threat.
[00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:46.116]  And you've got the dictator, the religious dictator, who's very unpopular over Iran.
[00:11:46.617 --> 00:11:50.980]  They've got national, international polls where 70 plus percent of folks don't want to be under their system.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.862]  Saying, don't worry, we'll blow all these U.S.
[00:11:53.882 --> 00:11:54.362]  ships up.
[00:11:54.402 --> 00:11:55.643]  They're not a threat, they're a target.
[00:11:57.024 --> 00:11:58.585]  And just really asking for it.
[00:12:00.034 --> 00:12:01.495]  So Iran commander calls U.S.
[00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:03.655]  military and Gulf a target, not a threat.
[00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:04.516]  And so here's the problem.
[00:12:04.576 --> 00:12:09.617]  If we let Iran get deployable nuclear weapons, they already have atomic weapons.
[00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:10.778]  It's been known for a decade.
[00:12:11.658 --> 00:12:16.640]  If they get delivery systems, then everybody else is going to demand them in the region, just like India and Pakistan.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.141]  And the world is that much closer to nuclear war.
[00:12:22.982 --> 00:12:23.742]  So think about that.
[00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:28.904]  And most analysts believe a nuclear war breaks out between India and Pakistan.
[00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:36.370]  So that's just some of what we're dealing with here.
[00:12:37.651 --> 00:12:38.992]  Iran commander calls U.S.
[00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:41.614]  military in Gulf a target, not a threat.
[00:12:49.021 --> 00:12:49.841]  So think about that.
[00:12:51.262 --> 00:12:52.744]  That's where we are as a country.
[00:12:53.584 --> 00:12:59.950]  While we have the Democrats working against our national interest internally, we have Hollywood trying to demoralize the nation.
[00:13:01.704 --> 00:13:04.665]  Oh, we have all these socialist and communist countries collapsing around us.
[00:13:05.605 --> 00:13:08.386]  Oh, we have over 10,000 people a day smashing over the border.
[00:13:09.446 --> 00:13:18.788]  Oh, we have every blue city and Democrat-controlled state going bankrupt with mass exoduses out of their own areas.
[00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:28.210]  We're told, though, that socialism and globalism
[00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:30.339]  Are the answers.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:43.587]  And we're told that China can have all these internal taxation and regulatory systems against us to make it prohibitive for them to buy any of our goods.
[00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:51.571]  And we're told that a 90, excuse me, a $900 billion a year trade deficit is a good thing.
[00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:56.534]  And then Trump just simply says, give us a few hundred billion cut off of that.
[00:13:58.453 --> 00:13:59.594]  Stop demanding that U.S.
[00:13:59.634 --> 00:14:06.116]  companies that move to China transfer all of our technology that U.S.
[00:14:06.156 --> 00:14:08.077]  taxpayers paid to develop via DARPA.
[00:14:09.178 --> 00:14:10.478]  That's where almost all of it comes from.
[00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:11.739]  Pure research.
[00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:14.740]  Companies won't do that, in most cases.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.161]  And we'll leave it like it is.
[00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:18.222]  But they go, no!
[00:14:19.062 --> 00:14:21.963]  We're going to finance Hollywood with a bunch of America-hating garbage.
[00:14:22.143 --> 00:14:23.804]  That's who owns Hollywood now, the Communist Chinese.
[00:14:24.144 --> 00:14:25.945]  We're going to buy up your debt and try to control you.
[00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.926]  That's who owns the majority of our debts, the private Chai Comps.
[00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:33.472]  And they say, we're gonna demoralize you and run you in the ground and we're not gonna give you crap.
[00:14:34.343 --> 00:14:35.423]  And we're going to piss in your face.
[00:14:36.384 --> 00:14:46.188]  Even though 60 years ago, 90 plus percent of our country didn't have electricity or running water, and you built us up and you did this and you saved us from the Japanese, we don't care.
[00:14:46.648 --> 00:14:59.274]  Because Harvard and the Rockefellers came over here and set us up and told us we were the elite, we were the uber-menschen, we were the supermen, we were going to have the Chinese century, and we're in the Chinese century now.
[00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:01.895]  So you crawl in your holes and you die.
[00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:06.268]  And you teach your five-year-old, boy, he's a little girl.
[00:15:06.288 --> 00:15:09.350]  And you teach your five-year-old girl, she's a little boy.
[00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.693]  And you teach your son how to give a blowjob.
[00:15:13.393 --> 00:15:14.714]  That's what China funds.
[00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.677]  And I have articles today where China executes people that do that there.
[00:15:19.557 --> 00:15:21.719]  And Cuba is banning gay parades.
[00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:23.360]  And you know what Cuba says?
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.841]  They said, we don't allow it.
[00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:28.063]  It's meant to demoralize and collapse our civilization.
[00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:31.386]  And they know because they're financing it here.
[00:15:32.503 --> 00:15:34.084]  And again, I'm a libertarian.
[00:15:34.144 --> 00:15:36.065]  I'm not attacking anybody for the love of their lives.
[00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:39.027]  But targeting kids is evil and pedophilia, period.
[00:15:39.628 --> 00:15:40.568]  And that's what the left does.
[00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:43.751]  So just remember, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:15:44.051 --> 00:15:45.572]  War with China has already begun.
[00:15:45.852 --> 00:15:47.013]  It's economic, it's cultural.
[00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:50.995]  Trump is just putting up a basic, moderate defense.
[00:15:51.516 --> 00:15:52.656]  And their answer is no.
[00:15:53.597 --> 00:15:54.358]  We own you.
[00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:55.618]  We run you.
[00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:57.540]  Bow to us.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.400]  Well, guess what?
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.701]  You're weak, China.
[00:16:00.101 --> 00:16:01.042]  You're going to fall.
[00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:02.103]  You're about to get it.
[00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:05.852]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropin.

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.582]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[00:16:28.742 --> 00:16:31.023]  And that, of course, is knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.

[00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.575]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:38.577]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[00:19:38.737 --> 00:19:41.659]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:42.480]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.200]  Well, you know what?
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.501]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.562]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[00:19:46.582 --> 00:19:47.463]  We decided to change the name.
[00:19:47.543 --> 00:19:48.764]  So when you peel off the label,
[00:19:49.987 --> 00:19:52.109]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.332]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[00:19:56.492 --> 00:19:58.093]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.

[00:20:19.394 --> 00:20:23.097]  You're listening to The Antidote for fake news.
[00:20:23.677 --> 00:20:25.638]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:32.984]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away.
[00:20:33.104 --> 00:20:40.649]  I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me.
[00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:45.152]  The love we share seems to go nowhere.
[00:20:45.172 --> 00:20:47.334]  But the problem is every time I'm
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.721]  Gotta just back off.
[00:20:50.581 --> 00:20:53.323]  The globalists come and try to destroy my life.
[00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:57.325]  So I guess they're gonna get a fight now.
[00:20:57.345 --> 00:21:00.607]  No holds barred.
[00:21:01.767 --> 00:21:05.229]  You can feel the global engineers realizing humanity's awakening and they're panting.
[00:21:05.249 --> 00:21:06.110]  They don't know what to do.
[00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.751]  I want to get back into China.
[00:21:08.611 --> 00:21:14.314]  I want to get back into the situation with the globalists trying to collapse our borders.
[00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:15.495]  The situation with Iran.
[00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:16.656]  All of this.
[00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.651]  Is designed to test the president.
[00:21:19.671 --> 00:21:35.943]  Remember Hillary and Joe Biden and Michael Moore and all the usual suspects when Trump was being inaugurated they said even if Russiagate doesn't take him out, which it will because he's a Russian agent, we have the intel, we've been spying on him.
[00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:38.085]  Remember they admitted all that and later said they didn't?
[00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:45.110]  They said there's going to be international crises that he's not going to be able to dial back.
[00:21:46.943 --> 00:21:51.066]  Well, Trump dialed back North Korea to a great extent.
[00:21:51.106 --> 00:21:51.866]  Still a big problem.
[00:21:52.226 --> 00:21:52.927]  He didn't create it.
[00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:53.647]  We didn't create it.
[00:21:54.868 --> 00:21:55.849]  Communism enabled it.
[00:21:57.089 --> 00:22:11.479]  And the fact that MacArthur wasn't allowed to finish them back when the president at that time allowed the CHICOMS to attack us 10 to 1.
[00:22:13.496 --> 00:22:28.846]  And then they relieved, Harry Truman relieved of command MacArthur, but... So I guess it kind of is our problem for not following through, but... The point is... That the globalists have created a worldwide strategy of tension.
[00:22:28.866 --> 00:22:36.871]  They admit they try to create bad countries, dysfunctional systems, so that then big multinational corporations can exploit those countries and control them.
[00:22:37.972 --> 00:22:40.954]  And Trump does not believe in that type of politics.
[00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:49.354]  And in more than 60 years, we have not had an establishment that thinks the way Trump thinks.
[00:22:50.855 --> 00:23:02.962]  About 60 years ago, they began to phase out the pragmatist and the real nation builders, and really what made America the apple of the eye, and people saw us as good guys, because if we took you over, we'd leave and you'd be in a better position.
[00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:04.443]  Hell, look at Japan.
[00:23:04.943 --> 00:23:06.164]  Look at China after World War II.
[00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:11.072]  But that all changed in the last 55, 60 years.
[00:23:11.632 --> 00:23:13.732]  It began to convert over to globalism.
[00:23:15.253 --> 00:23:18.673]  Where you look at the IMF, the World Bank, these big banks that control the U.S.
[00:23:19.154 --> 00:23:28.316]  When they come in and give you a loan, they pay the politicians off to never pay it back, to make sure a billion dollar Nigerian loan ends up being a hundred billion U.O.
[00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:33.977]  Or if it's a Guatemalan, half a billion dollar loan, they end up paying back ten billion.
[00:23:35.694 --> 00:23:36.995]  Politician runs off with the money.
[00:23:37.535 --> 00:23:39.096]  It's agreed to up front.
[00:23:40.696 --> 00:23:45.098]  A microcosm of that, or a modern example, would be Qaddafi.
[00:23:45.518 --> 00:23:53.202]  Eight years before they kill him, Obama gets in, says, I want to work with you, invest with the West.
[00:23:54.127 --> 00:23:56.047]  Decry all the stuff you've done, we'll work with you.
[00:23:56.568 --> 00:24:01.829]  Qaddafi opens up everything, brings in the United States and the West, invest all his money in the West.
[00:24:02.489 --> 00:24:07.350]  They totally encircle him, set him up, bring in Al-Qaeda to overthrow him and kill him.
[00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.211]  And then Hillary makes a bunch of sick jokes about, she came, she saw, he died.
[00:24:13.492 --> 00:24:18.513]  But she tells people in New Hampshire last week, they say I'm a murderer, it's fake news.
[00:24:19.953 --> 00:24:20.473]  Give me a break.
[00:24:21.974 --> 00:24:22.354]  So again,
[00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:25.510]  They want a strategy of dysfunction.
[00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.390]  Look at Hollywood.
[00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:28.271]  Look at what's taught in the schools.
[00:24:28.331 --> 00:24:29.452]  Look at what's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:33.354]  They admit they want you dumb, desperate, and dysfunctional.
[00:24:33.374 --> 00:24:37.957]  Remember what Sean Parker, one of the co-founders of Facebook, said last year?
[00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:46.301]  He said, we designed it 15 years ago to make you depressed, to make you stupid, to make you alone.
[00:24:48.052 --> 00:24:49.513]  To play on your weaknesses?
[00:24:49.653 --> 00:24:53.415]  And he said, I thought it was immoral then, but I still did it to dominate.
[00:24:54.896 --> 00:24:59.519]  He said, what they're doing now is hundreds of times worse.
[00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:01.721]  There it is.
[00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:06.144]  He says, we exploit your psychological vulnerability.
[00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:17.331]  Ladies and gentlemen, 60 years ago, our government, and I've studied it, wasn't perfect, but it didn't act like that.
[00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:27.944]  Because I call it the Needle DI-K Dimension, or the Chicken SH-T Dimension.
[00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:33.425]  People, men and leaders were strong back then.
[00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:40.687]  And they believed America was dominant, and they believed in the West, and you know, you could call it
[00:25:43.103 --> 00:25:49.665]  The burden of the West or whatever, but there really wasn't a real exploitation of the third world in places.
[00:25:49.765 --> 00:25:52.746]  There was a real attempt in most cases to build people up.
[00:25:55.547 --> 00:25:58.568]  And that all just went out the window with the modern liberal system.
[00:25:59.028 --> 00:26:10.772]  Because they tell themselves they're liberal, they tell everybody how they're doing it for this great moral reason, when they always ally with the most bloodthirsty killers the planet's ever seen.
[00:26:12.486 --> 00:26:17.948]  But because they know what Rudger Kipling wrote about the white man's burden.
[00:26:18.969 --> 00:26:27.032]  Because they know ingrained in Western leaders is a guilt about cultural historical superiority.
[00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:30.354]  Because if you don't have that guilt, you become the Nazis and start killing everybody.
[00:26:32.145 --> 00:26:34.086]  So, okay, we're not going to be social Darwinists because we're dominant.
[00:26:34.106 --> 00:26:34.967]  We're not going to kill everybody.
[00:26:35.507 --> 00:26:36.447]  We're going to help everybody.
[00:26:36.788 --> 00:26:41.130]  Well, then we get infected with globalism that takes control of us.
[00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:47.854]  It's predatory, but it's telling us we've got to do what it says or we're predators, but in truth, they're predators.
[00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:53.978]  And so they tell the West, you're evil because you're white.
[00:26:54.658 --> 00:26:55.899]  Now let's get rid of the West.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.502]  When inherently the West ended slavery.
[00:26:58.822 --> 00:27:00.704]  Inherently the West empowered women.
[00:27:01.004 --> 00:27:03.526]  Inherently the West didn't kill gays.
[00:27:04.827 --> 00:27:08.010]  But you notice the Left doesn't care about China executing gays.
[00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:14.316]  It doesn't care about Cuba arresting and banning any display of homosexual activity.
[00:27:14.336 --> 00:27:15.097]  That's in the news today.
[00:27:15.437 --> 00:27:16.278]  They love it!
[00:27:17.355 --> 00:27:18.435]  They don't care.
[00:27:19.636 --> 00:27:21.036]  They love radical Islam.
[00:27:22.797 --> 00:27:25.218]  The West funded the Democrats.
[00:27:26.098 --> 00:27:39.623]  The left, Silicon Valley, funded the Arab Spring to put women into sex slavery and dislodge millions of refugees and kill hundreds of thousands because they're taking down the West.
[00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:42.887]  And the left is not the West.
[00:27:43.668 --> 00:27:53.280]  The left is a miscreant, mercenary virus here to manipulate those of us that have a conscience into giving full control to them.
[00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:55.463]  Now, I haven't gotten to Klipsch yet.
[00:27:55.503 --> 00:27:56.384]  I've got a bunch of them.
[00:27:57.585 --> 00:27:59.047]  And I'm going to get to some of these when we come back.
[00:27:59.087 --> 00:28:00.089]  But Trump tweeted this out.
[00:28:01.408 --> 00:28:04.710]  Globalists live in their own universe, think tariffs are satanic.
[00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:13.917]  No, what they think is Western countries not selling out their wealth to Western globalists that have made deals with China, Mexico, India, and others.
[00:28:14.217 --> 00:28:22.442]  That's a no-no, because just like in England or any blue city in the U.S., if you protect yourself from someone raping your wife,
[00:28:23.303 --> 00:28:27.305]  Who has a weapon and you hurt them, you go to prison, they go free.
[00:28:27.805 --> 00:28:35.329]  Because the great sin is the prey no longer being the prey and defending themselves.
[00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:44.374]  So we're going to finish up with China and the trade battle and the fact that Trump is doing an overall great job.
[00:28:44.394 --> 00:28:51.078]  And the fact that it scares the globalists because they were just a bunch of managers managing the carving up and sell-off of the West.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.621]  Here comes Trump.
[00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:53.401]  He's flipping the door.
[00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:55.162]  Here comes InfoWars.
[00:28:55.282 --> 00:28:59.065]  Here comes you, the audience, with your foot in the door, saying, not so fast.
[00:28:59.805 --> 00:29:00.445]  We have rights.
[00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:04.128]  Mike owns.
[00:29:05.402 --> 00:29:10.947]  A big accredited major research lab, accredited to test food, supplements, water, you name it.
[00:29:11.387 --> 00:29:12.568]  He mentioned this a few weeks ago.
[00:29:12.588 --> 00:29:13.689]  We've been so busy, haven't done it.
[00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:22.336]  It's funny, we're running a special on Alexa Pure Pro water filtration systems that, again, are one of the best gravity-fed systems out there.
[00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:23.617]  I mean, there's some other good units out there.
[00:29:23.637 --> 00:29:24.617]  We sell Pro Pure as well.
[00:29:26.239 --> 00:29:27.560]  He's not even trying to help the show.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.320]  This is what he does.
[00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:30.402]  He's tested all our products.
[00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:31.464]  He tested many other products.
[00:29:31.484 --> 00:29:32.505]  People pay him to test products.
[00:29:32.525 --> 00:29:33.186]  We haven't done that.
[00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:39.393]  But you found something interesting testing our system against other systems.
[00:29:39.433 --> 00:29:40.354]  I appreciate you doing that.
[00:29:40.374 --> 00:29:42.276]  I know it cost thousands of dollars to do it.
[00:29:42.296 --> 00:29:43.037]  I didn't ask you to.
[00:29:43.097 --> 00:29:43.998]  I should have asked you to.
[00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:47.462]  But obviously, these are already accredited by other groups that have tested it.
[00:29:47.502 --> 00:29:48.623]  But tell us what you found independently.
[00:29:48.843 --> 00:29:53.126]  Yeah, well, so to set the proper context, we were not paid.
[00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:55.728]  I did this as a volunteer, and I'll tell you why.
[00:29:55.788 --> 00:30:06.775]  Because, you know, I'm part of the independent media as well, and I've seen how you have been just viciously attacked over your supplements, even when your supplements are vastly superior to what's available in retail.
[00:30:07.255 --> 00:30:09.077]  And I thought, you know, this is entirely unfair.
[00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:15.579]  If your products are the best, if they're really clean, if your water filters really work well, then frankly you deserve credit for that.
[00:30:15.619 --> 00:30:18.640]  So we have a multiple mass spec laboratory.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.061]  It's a multi-million dollar facility.
[00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:23.442]  I've got some video that I sent you this morning.
[00:30:23.482 --> 00:30:26.383]  Yeah, let's roll some of that and document cam his spectrometer stuff here.
[00:30:26.603 --> 00:30:32.926]  Yeah, and so we've been testing water filters for their ability to remove glyphosate, which is the toxic cancer-causing weed killer.
[00:30:33.906 --> 00:30:39.909]  And glyphosate is the most difficult chemical to remove from water.
[00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:41.189]  The most difficult.
[00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:46.311]  Laboratories, we worked for two years to get a method that could even retain it so that we could test it.
[00:30:46.672 --> 00:30:50.433]  And all the science papers out there show that it's the most difficult chemical analyte.
[00:30:50.473 --> 00:31:00.998]  Anyway, the bottom line, and I brought you the results here today, the Alexa Pure water filter that was sent to us for testing directly from the Alexa Pure company,
[00:31:01.858 --> 00:31:12.081]  We put two parts per million of glyphosate in water, ran it through the filter, took the resulting water, and ran it through our triple-quad mass spec.
[00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:14.362]  100% removal of glyphosate.
[00:31:14.522 --> 00:31:14.942]  100% removal.
[00:31:15.122 --> 00:31:19.604]  And again, you're the expert unless you have the scientists that work for you, but from what I've read, that's unprecedented.
[00:31:20.304 --> 00:31:24.706]  Well, out of all the filters we've ever tested, we've only seen three that could do this.
[00:31:24.746 --> 00:31:28.427]  They're all very expensive, more expensive than Alexa Pure, very high-end filters.
[00:31:29.427 --> 00:31:32.310]  With your sale, I think, that I just heard about, is $199?
[00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:33.591]  Yes.
[00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:38.255]  That is by far the most affordable filter that has this 100% efficacy.
[00:31:38.776 --> 00:31:41.218]  Now, and the thing is, glyphosate's an indicator.
[00:31:41.498 --> 00:31:51.047]  So if a water filter can remove glyphosate with 100% effectiveness, which is very rare to find, it means that it has the best chemistry in the water filter element.
[00:31:51.147 --> 00:31:55.671]  So if you could knock Mike Tyson out in 1989ish peak, you could beat anybody?
[00:31:55.891 --> 00:31:56.571]  Well, exactly.
[00:31:56.631 --> 00:32:05.255]  So it's going to remove atrazine, it's going to remove pesticides, it's going to remove bisphenol A, probably, and all these other toxic chemicals, plus heavy metals.
[00:32:05.275 --> 00:32:14.038]  We know heavy metals removal is typically very easy for water filters to accomplish, so that's not difficult for a lot of filters to do, but to remove glyphosate is a big deal.
[00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:17.480]  So, our lab, I've gone ahead and forwarded
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.180]  This graphic that you can use.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.121]  I'm giving you permission to use this on your website.
[00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:29.082]  Our lab, CWC Labs, is confirming 100% removal of glyphosate from the Alexa Pure water filter.
[00:32:29.342 --> 00:32:33.283]  You know, and we're also adding, by the way, atrazine to our testing protocols.
[00:32:33.343 --> 00:32:38.244]  So later this year, we'll be able to test everything with an internally validated atrazine method.
[00:32:38.284 --> 00:32:43.845]  And look, I don't want to get too geeky, you know, for... For folks who don't know, that's the chemical that turns the freaking frogs gay.
[00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:47.507]  And if you don't want that exposure, you need to have a filtration system.
[00:32:47.527 --> 00:32:48.407]  Yes, it's very simple.
[00:32:48.447 --> 00:32:56.451]  If all our listeners went and got an Alexa Pure Pro, their biggest, best system, sits right on your counter, dump the water in, it does tens of thousands of gallons in its lifetime.
[00:32:56.791 --> 00:32:58.092]  Folks, filter your water.
[00:32:58.112 --> 00:32:59.393]  This is the best system for the price.
[00:32:59.733 --> 00:33:01.474]  Do it for your children and fund the info work.
[00:33:01.594 --> 00:33:01.954]  Do it!
[00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:08.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.755 --> 00:33:21.336]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:21.656 --> 00:33:27.978]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.661]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence
[00:34:08.203 --> 00:34:23.279]  The co-founders of Facebook says that the company is un-American and the government should break it up into several smaller companies because Mark Zuckerberg not only controls Facebook, but he also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, the popular text messaging app.
[00:34:23.479 --> 00:34:27.781]  Well, the Facebook that exists today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004.
[00:34:28.141 --> 00:34:36.806]  And the one that we have today, I think, is far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is not accountable.
[00:34:36.986 --> 00:34:42.008]  This is Chris Hughes, and he was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate in college, and one of several co-founders.
[00:34:42.228 --> 00:34:45.030]  Not the one that Zuckerberg tried to completely screw over, though.
[00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:49.072]  That was Eduardo Saverin, as depicted in the movie, The Social Network.
[00:34:49.332 --> 00:34:57.775]  But now this guy just wrote an op-ed in the New York Times and is doing interviews denouncing Zuckerberg and the gigantic monopoly that he controls.
[00:34:58.075 --> 00:35:16.181]  I've been warning about what Facebook would become for over 10 years and thankfully people are finally starting to wake up because they're seeing people like Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son, getting suspended for hate speech for something he posted two years ago because their AI is getting more sophisticated by the day.
[00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:22.870]  Keeps combing through old posts and found a homophobic remark that he had posted.
[00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:30.321]  I mean, Facebook even censored the Declaration of Independence after their AI detected that it refers to, quote, Indian savages.
[00:35:30.581 --> 00:35:31.643]  And that's hate speech, too.
[00:35:31.983 --> 00:35:36.646]  In a scathing op-ed in the New York Times, Hughes calls Facebook's dominance a monopoly.
[00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:42.650]  More than 6 billion monthly active users across all Facebook properties dwarfing the competition.
[00:35:43.031 --> 00:35:52.097]  Now, Hughes is calling for the government to break up the company, undo Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and create a new regulatory agency.
[00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:56.780]  He says Mark Zuckerberg's power is unprecedented and un-American.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:06.474]  When Mark Zuckerberg's college roommate and co-founder of his multi-billion dollar empire is saying that he's a tyrant who needs to be stopped, somebody should probably do something.
[00:36:06.734 --> 00:36:10.139]  Meanwhile, Instagram is now gonna start fact-checking memes.
[00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:11.742]  They're fact-checking memes!
[00:36:12.122 --> 00:36:33.846]  The Verge reports that a test starting this week, Instagram will begin sending posts that potentially contain misinformation to the same dashboard currently used by Facebook's fact-checking partners, giving their teams the chance to help limit the spread of hoaxes on Instagram with no change to the workflow they are already familiar with.
[00:36:34.246 --> 00:36:36.827]  I wasn't kidding, they're gonna start fact-checking memes!
[00:36:37.387 --> 00:36:46.833]  I'm sure that we can trust the same moderators that took down this Jussie Smollett Scooby-Doo meme from my Instagram account and said that it violated the community standards.
[00:36:47.174 --> 00:36:51.416]  Your post has been deleted, they say, and they blur it out in the notification they give you.
[00:36:51.596 --> 00:36:56.720]  They don't even want you to really see the post that they took down, but obviously you can see that's the one that it was.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:03.545]  We want to keep Instagram a safe place for everyone, and we ask that you treat other members of the community with respect and sense.
[00:37:03.785 --> 00:37:09.049]  We remove content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them.
[00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:11.610]  Jesse Smollett's a public figure, you morons!
[00:37:12.011 --> 00:37:19.256]  Previously, they had also censored this viral CNN meme, saying that it, too, violated the community standards.
[00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:21.677]  But the Orwellian Nightmare is getting even worse.
[00:37:21.878 --> 00:37:30.124]  Microsoft is upgrading Microsoft Word so that it will detect offensive words in your documents that you have typed.
[00:37:30.624 --> 00:37:37.149]  Although Word already corrects misspelled words and suggests changes to your grammar, it's going to go a bit further.
[00:37:37.169 --> 00:37:42.873]  It will look more closely at your language, suggesting more appropriate words.
[00:37:43.373 --> 00:37:48.497]  Also looks at your language to make sure that it's appropriately gender inclusive.
[00:37:48.877 --> 00:37:50.018]  No thank you, Microsoft.
[00:37:50.078 --> 00:37:52.121]  I like my writing style just as it is.
[00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:57.487]  CNN is still celebrating the latest round of Facebook censorship and calling for more, of course.
[00:37:57.787 --> 00:38:01.231]  Alright, Facebook kicked some people off over the last several days.
[00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:02.353]  Awful.
[00:38:02.693 --> 00:38:03.133]  Oh, horrible.
[00:38:03.153 --> 00:38:05.957]  I mean, conspiracies, they're just the most disgusting conspiracy theorists.
[00:38:06.357 --> 00:38:08.801]  This is what the President has said about this move.
[00:38:08.841 --> 00:38:09.962]  He's stuck up for these people.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.122]  We are monitoring and watching closely.
[00:38:23.082 --> 00:38:28.847]  Joe, what message does that send when the President is protecting InfoWars?
[00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:32.369]  Well, it says that the President is trying to protect the First Amendment, sir.
[00:38:32.449 --> 00:38:37.473]  I know it's been a long time since we've had one with that kind of integrity, so it comes as quite a surprise to you.
[00:38:37.753 --> 00:38:43.858]  But MSNBC is assuring Americans that there's no anti-conservative bias at all in the big tech companies.
[00:38:44.378 --> 00:38:58.071]  Conspiracy theories about, you know, sort of anti-conservative bias, which I can assure you, at global companies operating at the scale of a company like Facebook, just quite honestly do not exist.
[00:38:58.212 --> 00:38:59.853]  It's just a conspiracy theory, guys!
[00:38:59.913 --> 00:39:01.495]  It's all in your imagination!
[00:39:05.717 --> 00:39:10.799]  So it's been a week since I was declared a dangerous person and kicked off Facebook.
[00:39:10.919 --> 00:39:11.739]  Boo hoo!
[00:39:12.279 --> 00:39:15.000]  But think about how totalitarian this is.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:24.563]  Mark Zuckerberg is literally telling 2.4 billion people, a third of the Earth's population, what opinions they can and can't hold.
[00:39:24.683 --> 00:39:32.286]  They've actually instituted a new policy on Facebook where talking about me, unless you're denouncing me, is verboten.
[00:39:32.386 --> 00:39:35.167]  There have even been reports that photos of myself and other
[00:39:35.447 --> 00:39:40.674]  Banned thought criminals, even when the faces are blurred, are being removed.
[00:39:40.814 --> 00:39:45.100]  Just like old Uncle Joe had his enemies airbrushed out of history.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:52.549]  Hey, at least during the two minutes of hate in 1984, the citizens of Oceania could at least see Goldstein's face.
[00:39:57.947 --> 00:40:01.749]  Zuckerberg is literally copying Stalinist Russia.
[00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:03.390]  Think that sounds like hyperbole?
[00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.890]  No.
[00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:07.252]  This is Samizdat for the 21st century.
[00:40:07.312 --> 00:40:11.774]  Samizdat was a form of dissident activity to avoid Soviet censorship.
[00:40:11.855 --> 00:40:19.799]  Dissidents reproduced censored material at great risk to themselves because much like Facebook controls the majority of online discourse,
[00:40:20.259 --> 00:40:25.783]  Copy machines, printing presses and typewriters were all controlled by the KGB.
[00:40:25.843 --> 00:40:31.427]  The KGB enjoyed a monopoly, so they were able to monitor and manipulate public discourse.
[00:40:31.768 --> 00:40:36.711]  Just like Facebook's monopoly allows it to monitor and manipulate public discourse.
[00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:41.615]  So eventually, dissidents had to produce handmade carbon copies of information.
[00:40:41.735 --> 00:40:47.679]  Much like we're having to create our own social media network simply to reach any kind of audience.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:54.544]  When individuals were caught reading or transporting banned Samizdat materials, they were hit with harsh punishment.
[00:40:54.645 --> 00:40:57.847]  Some were sent to Gulags, just as I've been dispatched.
[00:40:57.927 --> 00:41:03.873]  To the digital Gulag, as may you be if you share my banned Samizdat material on Facebook.
[00:41:04.073 --> 00:41:12.582]  Just like yours truly, to prevent other citizens from embracing their ideas, Samizdat dissidents were put on show trials and declared...
[00:41:13.143 --> 00:41:14.484]  Dangerous persons!
[00:41:14.685 --> 00:41:20.951]  And listen, I'm not putting myself in the same context as historical dissidents who suffered torture and incarceration.
[00:41:20.991 --> 00:41:31.002]  But I am putting Comrade Zuckerberg in the same context as authoritarian, narcissistic despots who created power monopolies to crush dissent.
[00:41:36.974 --> 00:41:45.760]  And just like the fictional Thought Police in Orwell's 1984, we've handed organised outrage mobs the power to remove people from society.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.443]  There's no future for dissident voices on social media.
[00:41:49.583 --> 00:41:53.926]  Everything edgy, daring or mischievous will be cleansed.
[00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:58.569]  We're gonna have to go back to old school methods like mailing lists and websites.

[00:42:04.053 --> 00:42:07.034]  You can also follow me on Telegram, link in description.
[00:42:07.254 --> 00:42:13.797]  Oh, the irony of a platform owned by Russians being one of the last sanctuaries for freedom of speech.
[00:42:14.118 --> 00:42:17.219]  Facebook's a private company, it can do what it likes.
[00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:23.542]  Oh wow, leftists suddenly did a 180 and started believing there should be no regulation of big corporations.
[00:42:24.162 --> 00:42:28.549]  Right at around the same time that big corporations start silencing their political opposition.
[00:42:28.649 --> 00:42:29.991]  What a coincidence!
[00:42:30.252 --> 00:42:37.082]  Because giving a billionaire oligarch monopolist the power to decide who has free speech and what opinions you can express...
[00:42:37.759 --> 00:42:39.721]  Is progressive!
[00:42:40.082 --> 00:42:45.327]  If you value my message, if you don't want to see it silenced, I need your support.
[00:42:45.487 --> 00:42:49.351]  I've created a Subscribestar which is linked in the description below.
[00:42:49.531 --> 00:42:55.197]  Unlike Patreon, Subscribestar is run by people who actually support free speech.
[00:42:55.597 --> 00:42:57.559]  So it's never going to be deplatformed.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.101]  Folks, we'll be right back.
[00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:00.843]  Stay with us for big breaking news.
[00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:14.253]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, buy some of the great products, see how great they are, and sign up for AutoShip so you don't forget to order every 15 days, every month, every two months.
[00:43:14.853 --> 00:43:16.274]  One click, you can cancel it.
[00:43:16.294 --> 00:43:18.555]  You can order up to every nine months on AutoShip.
[00:43:18.615 --> 00:43:20.716]  Get the coffee, get the products, get it all.
[00:43:20.796 --> 00:43:22.636]  That's how I fund this operation.
[00:43:22.696 --> 00:43:23.657]  That's how I do this.
[00:43:23.717 --> 00:43:27.339]  And it's 100% up to you funding us to decide whether we're going to be here or not.
[00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:28.259]  Because let me tell you something right now.
[00:43:28.459 --> 00:43:29.139]  I'm not giving up.
[00:43:29.219 --> 00:43:29.919]  I'm not backing down.
[00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:30.479]  I'm not giving in.
[00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:32.840]  But I would have already had 24 hours of shows a day.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.460]  I would have already had 10 more reporters hired.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.740]  I would have already done a lot more.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:41.561]  Instead of spending most of my time figuring out how to pay for things around here to stay on air, I would just be on air, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:57.784]  But you get to that point when the days are so dark, when the shadows are so long, when the President is sitting there letting the First Amendment be undercut, and letting people have their bank accounts taken like we have, and our perfect credit score go from 2% on a credit card transfer up to 5%, all of that's what's killing us, and us having to pay for our own bandwidth.
[00:43:57.824 --> 00:44:01.786]  We still have millions of viewers a day and listeners at Infowars.com, but now I gotta pay for all the bandwidth.
[00:44:01.946 --> 00:44:03.367]  Doesn't have Google Ads all over it.
[00:44:03.387 --> 00:44:04.147]  It isn't on YouTube.
[00:44:04.287 --> 00:44:09.049]  So there's a heavy cost to being so popular, and I'm not bitchin', but I'm sayin', stayin' in the saddle.
[00:44:09.329 --> 00:44:11.530]  I'm not ridin' this bull for eight seconds, baby.
[00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.412]  I've been ridin' this sucker for 25 years from nowhere.
[00:44:15.512 --> 00:44:17.533]  We built the whole thing thanks to your support, but now...
[00:44:17.793 --> 00:44:19.895]  I'm not riding some toy bull in the backyard.
[00:44:20.095 --> 00:44:23.298]  I'm riding the biggest, meanest, snarling creature you've ever seen.
[00:44:23.418 --> 00:44:24.719]  And I'm not wearing body armor.
[00:44:24.839 --> 00:44:27.362]  And I gotta stay on this son of a bitch for years.
[00:44:27.662 --> 00:44:30.765]  And that means I gotta take my face being beat in the back of his head.
[00:44:30.785 --> 00:44:33.667]  It means I gotta sit there and let my groin get smashed.
[00:44:33.928 --> 00:44:36.170]  And I gotta be like a demon and just hold on.
[00:44:37.449 --> 00:44:40.030]  But this isn't a technical rodeo, so I can hold on with both hands.
[00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:41.071]  And believe me, I am.
[00:44:41.091 --> 00:44:42.431]  I got that bull around the neck.
[00:44:42.892 --> 00:44:46.933]  And I'm just focused and zenned out in a berserker viking way.
[00:44:47.073 --> 00:44:49.134]  The berserker spirit in a zen focus.
[00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:55.477]  Just... And the globalists feel the will.
[00:44:55.617 --> 00:44:57.738]  The spirit of 1776 that we manifest.
[00:44:58.179 --> 00:45:00.199]  Nobody manifested like us except Trump.
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.200]  And we're punching through the enemy.
[00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:02.901]  Focus.
[00:45:04.642 --> 00:45:06.583]  Not even thinking about it, not even saying it's hard to do.
[00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:14.028]  We're just laying our spiritual weight, and our will, and our focus, and our love for the unborn children against this dragon's gut.
[00:45:14.168 --> 00:45:17.831]  And the blood of the dragon's just pouring out on us, burning us like acid.
[00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:22.374]  My eyeballs are hanging out, and my heart's still beating.
[00:45:22.674 --> 00:45:34.522]  And the pain feels so good, because as I just ram that sword up into its heart, my arm is burning off, and I just hold the sword in its heart as it rots down, and as I prepare to collapse under its fat, dead weight.
[00:45:35.122 --> 00:45:36.043]  Total victory!
[00:45:38.604 --> 00:45:44.087]  But I need funding, and I need prayer, and I need support, and I need to see your war face!
[00:45:44.507 --> 00:45:49.549]  These are pedophile, devil-worshipping, child-harvesting, soulless scum we're up against!
[00:45:49.909 --> 00:46:03.836]  And if you don't know this is the real rallying point, and this massive total censorship coming in to control what words you can say and to surveil you and what you do, if you don't know this is the big enchilada, then you aren't conscious and you don't realize what's happening!
[00:46:03.976 --> 00:46:06.819]  And the system thinks you're so asleep, you don't even know what's going on.
[00:46:06.979 --> 00:46:08.820]  Well, our audience does know what's going on.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.002]  You can feel the damn energy in this country, so I'll tell you.
[00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:13.404]  Who knows how long you can go to m4warrestore.com.
[00:46:13.705 --> 00:46:19.049]  Who knows how long you can even go there and buy X2, or buy the great coffee, or buy the new products we've got.
[00:46:19.149 --> 00:46:26.175]  And listen, if you don't want to belly up to the bar and flood us with money so I can do a good stand-up fight against these bastards, then that's your choice in life.
[00:46:26.235 --> 00:46:27.937]  I really don't give a goddamn anymore.
[00:46:28.097 --> 00:46:29.257]  Because I'm fighting all the way.
[00:46:29.497 --> 00:46:30.137]  I'm energized.
[00:46:30.377 --> 00:46:30.798]  I'm awake.
[00:46:31.078 --> 00:46:31.698]  I'm not dead.
[00:46:32.058 --> 00:46:35.999]  People ask me how the hell I can have so much energy when I come in here and I'm not like this in person.
[00:46:36.539 --> 00:46:39.259]  They're creating a world government Mark of the Beast.
[00:46:39.419 --> 00:46:41.860]  2.2 billion people just got told they can't use certain words.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.980]  They're announcing giant cult-like brainwashing.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.221]  They're teaching five-year-olds how to suck cock in public school.
[00:46:47.521 --> 00:46:50.902]  They are sitting there doing everything you could ever freaking imagine.
[00:46:51.142 --> 00:46:53.162]  Killing babies after they're born.
[00:46:53.662 --> 00:47:01.434]  And the churches are such pharisees, they're worried that I just talked about sucking cock instead of killing babies and chucking their damn organs out!
[00:47:06.822 --> 00:47:09.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.498 --> 00:47:32.199]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:32.479 --> 00:47:35.980]  It's Mother's Day, Sunday, 12th day of May 2019.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.302]  I said I wasn't getting into censorship towards the end of the show.
[00:47:40.102 --> 00:47:42.763]  I said I wasn't going to get into it till the end of the show.
[00:47:43.483 --> 00:47:52.387]  But I had some family calls come in during that last break that were important, so I went to those two different reports you just saw that deal with the censorship.
[00:47:53.499 --> 00:47:54.580]  So thanks for staying with us.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.660]  Again, I am live.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.882]  You just saw that report from Paul Joseph Watson, also one from Mark Dice.
[00:48:01.563 --> 00:48:08.707]  This whole censorship is about stealing the election ahead of 2020 from Trump and other populist candidates around the world.
[00:48:08.747 --> 00:48:09.647]  That's all this is.
[00:48:10.248 --> 00:48:14.210]  Big tech and their own internal admissions and their own leaks admit all this.
[00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.410]  That's what's so insulting.
[00:48:16.231 --> 00:48:20.553]  But getting back to Trump, the Democrats and the globalists and other anti-American
[00:48:22.708 --> 00:48:25.589]  Collaborators don't know what to do.
[00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:39.114]  Because all over the world, people understand that China is the most authoritarian country to ever exist on this planet by leaps and bounds.
[00:48:39.755 --> 00:48:46.837]  I don't have to repeat the number out there, but the Chaikoms have killed five times the number of their own people that Hitler did.
[00:48:47.498 --> 00:48:48.478]  And Hitler's bad.
[00:48:49.318 --> 00:48:50.739]  Hitler was real bad.
[00:48:53.638 --> 00:48:53.958]  I don't
[00:49:09.781 --> 00:49:18.429]  Groups that are pro-Soviet and pro-Hitler, I think they're rebellious, go, well, the United States dropped atomic bombs on people and bombed cities and did all this.
[00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:26.437]  Yeah, because we were getting our ass kicked at first and we were dealing with super evil that was about to get nuclear weapons and we had to beat them decisively.
[00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:28.459]  That's what happens when you're in a fight for your life.
[00:49:28.779 --> 00:49:33.244]  You start pulling all of the governors away.
[00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:44.748]  You stop holding back and see the left thinks Trump getting elected and all this Americana talk and the economy coming back, that pisses them off.
[00:49:44.768 --> 00:49:45.948]  They want to break the economy.
[00:49:45.988 --> 00:49:47.868]  Cloward and Piven, it's their official strategy.
[00:49:48.508 --> 00:49:51.709]  And so they're so afraid to see us coming back.
[00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:55.390]  They just gives them a headache and they don't know what to do.
[00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.430]  And that's why we're in this situation we're in right now.
[00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:03.651]  So yes, the threat of war with Iran is very, very high.
[00:50:05.931 --> 00:50:07.112]  Iran commander calls U.S.
[00:50:07.152 --> 00:50:09.173]  military Gulf a target, not a threat.
[00:50:09.393 --> 00:50:10.494]  Very stupid to do that.
[00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:13.756]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[00:50:13.776 --> 00:50:16.398]  warns merchant ships of possible Iranian attacks.
[00:50:16.478 --> 00:50:17.719]  Cleric threatens U.S.
[00:50:17.779 --> 00:50:18.059]  fleet.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:19.520]  U.S.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.682]  sends assault ship missiles to Mideast amid Iran threat.
[00:50:25.063 --> 00:50:29.966]  Pentagon deploying Patriot battery to Middle East to further deter Iranian threat.
[00:50:31.516 --> 00:50:35.259]  Meanwhile, Cuba launches rationing in the face of their own crisis.
[00:50:36.699 --> 00:50:45.185]  That's just some of the news unfolding on that front, as all these authoritarian regimes circle the toilet bowl.
[00:50:45.645 --> 00:50:47.106]  I have several clips I want to play.
[00:50:47.166 --> 00:50:48.948]  TV viewers will obviously be able to see these.
[00:50:49.448 --> 00:50:50.829]  Radio listeners will be able to hear them.
[00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:53.170]  But here's that clip I was mentioning earlier.
[00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:56.833]  I'm going to play a clip out of Iran of women taking off their hijabs.
[00:50:57.373 --> 00:51:00.876]  Some of these videos are getting censored by Facebook and by Twitter.
[00:51:01.916 --> 00:51:13.966]  And Linda Sorcerer, that leads Soros' so-called Women March right into the arms of radical Islam and all the fun things it does, she says the women are troublemakers and should keep their hijabs on.
[00:51:14.307 --> 00:51:14.987]  That's right!
[00:51:15.107 --> 00:51:21.192]  Women should wear hoods over their heads and not stand out in the street with the threat of arrest, torture, or even killing.
[00:51:21.593 --> 00:51:25.536]  How dare those women not wear hoods over their heads?
[00:51:25.956 --> 00:51:33.319]  We're liberal women in America, and we say to women in the Middle East, you can't drive cars, you're gonna wear hoods over your heads.
[00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:35.520]  Allah Akbar.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.082]  But here's Michael Pillsburg, globalists live in their own universe, here it is.
[00:51:42.535 --> 00:51:54.579]  It is stunning to me, the reaction by Wall Street to tariffs, as if they were some sort of sophomores operating in an economics class.
[00:51:56.219 --> 00:51:58.540]  It's some university quite distant.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:09.783]  I mean, it's as if they don't comprehend what these deficits mean, that they don't realize that they cut into economic growth, that they reduce our rate of growth.
[00:52:11.616 --> 00:52:15.864]  Well, as you've said many times, I think that globalists live in their own universe.
[00:52:16.606 --> 00:52:19.151]  And in their universe, tariffs are satanic.
[00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:27.398]  And as you know very well, the president today said something quite cute, I thought, about Obama, that he let the Chinese get away with murder.
[00:52:28.138 --> 00:52:30.560]  So in a way, Lou, we've got to feel sorry for the Chinese.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:35.465]  They've been misled by the globalists and by President Obama that this day would never come.
[00:52:35.705 --> 00:52:36.906]  But actually, it's a great day.
[00:52:36.986 --> 00:52:39.528]  This is a major blow to Chinese aggression.
[00:52:40.029 --> 00:52:41.270]  They're going to think it over now.
[00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.032]  And I think Mnuchin might be right.
[00:52:43.712 --> 00:52:49.375]  They give them three or four weeks, you know, to see the tariffs begin to take effect, and then we'll see if they come back.
[00:52:49.515 --> 00:52:53.517]  I don't think we should go running over to Beijing ourselves with our next delegation.
[00:52:54.018 --> 00:52:57.400]  I think this twelfth round of the talk should be back here in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:57.640]  again.
[00:52:59.673 --> 00:53:00.874]  Now, the President tweeted that out.
[00:53:01.694 --> 00:53:07.298]  It's going to really frustrate the New York Times, the Washington Post, that say you're pro-America, you're a racist, or you're anti-Semitic.
[00:53:07.318 --> 00:53:08.259]  What does that have to do with it?
[00:53:08.619 --> 00:53:09.880]  Everybody knows Trump's pro-Israel.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:21.649]  So am I. But you can pull up the London Guardian, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Atlantic Monthly, and more stuff than I can read, just the last few days, saying Alex Jones is an anti-Semite.
[00:53:22.429 --> 00:53:24.230]  Why does Nigel Farage go on this show?
[00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:32.256]  Nigel Farage, whose party is about to be the majority party in the EU Parliament, which is an anti-EU party.
[00:53:33.917 --> 00:53:35.458]  No one buys into this crap anymore.
[00:53:36.298 --> 00:53:38.960]  The globalists call themselves globalists.
[00:53:40.121 --> 00:53:41.322]  They're not Jews.
[00:53:41.502 --> 00:53:42.683]  They're not Chinese.
[00:53:42.763 --> 00:53:43.683]  They're not German.
[00:53:43.703 --> 00:53:44.544]  They're not Mexican.
[00:53:44.824 --> 00:53:51.929]  They're people of every group working to transfer national power to unelected multinational groups.
[00:53:53.404 --> 00:54:00.227]  Hillary helped write all these multinational agreements to transfer power out of our country to these groups.
[00:54:01.448 --> 00:54:11.892]  They call themselves globalists, so they're trying everywhere to say, you know, Alex Jones says that dog whistle for Jews, globalism.
[00:54:12.413 --> 00:54:12.713]  Really?
[00:54:12.773 --> 00:54:14.574]  Benjamin Netanyahu's against globalism.
[00:54:16.855 --> 00:54:21.437]  And so the Economist, that's a globalist publication, tried to get him out of power and failed.
[00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:24.350]  Globalists are getting their ass kicked.
[00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:40.400]  Globalists are multinational corporations that are tax-exempt, that work with authoritarian regimes like the EU and China and collaborators like Hollywood to piss all over countries and deprive and rip off the populations.
[00:54:40.821 --> 00:54:47.365]  Any smart leader would want to take care of their people and be prosperous and that's where their kids live and everybody live together.
[00:54:47.585 --> 00:54:48.506]  Whether you're Russian or
[00:54:48.706 --> 00:54:53.789]  Or whether you're Israeli, or whether you're American, or whether you're Japanese, or whether you're Mexican.
[00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:58.511]  This has nothing to do with Jews.
[00:54:59.511 --> 00:55:04.594]  And the white supremacists flip out when I say that, because most of them are financed by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:55:04.774 --> 00:55:14.499]  They've been caught running most of the white supremacist groups, and they've been caught staging all these events, and funding the white supremacist marches, so that they can project that onto that.
[00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:15.079]  Think about that.
[00:55:17.406 --> 00:55:37.658]  We say we want America to make its own laws, and not have China have all these internal tariffs against our goods, and have us with a $500 billion trade deficit, and a $400 billion stolen technology deficit, $900 billion a year total, and we just say that's not fair, and the New York Times and the Washington Post say, why are you hating on Jews?
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:45.323]  They're the ones introducing Jews.
[00:55:48.325 --> 00:55:56.389]  Just like Pepe the Frog was this popular sign of rebellion, just because it was silly, against Hillary, had nothing to do with white supremacists.
[00:55:59.071 --> 00:56:05.154]  And Hillary came out and said, and that frog, in the same speech she attacked me, that frog's a white supremacist.
[00:56:05.174 --> 00:56:08.275]  It became a huge joke, like the OK symbol.
[00:56:09.996 --> 00:56:11.537]  It's a joke about the left.
[00:56:13.518 --> 00:56:14.479]  Then I got sued.
[00:56:15.444 --> 00:56:17.284]  For making the frog white supremacist.
[00:56:17.304 --> 00:56:18.925]  We're, by the way, winning that court case right now.
[00:56:19.505 --> 00:56:20.265]  I didn't settle it.
[00:56:21.105 --> 00:56:21.766]  Settle it for $14,000?
[00:56:21.826 --> 00:56:24.586]  How about I spend a million and defeat you?
[00:56:26.247 --> 00:56:28.007]  Because that's how this works.
[00:56:28.107 --> 00:56:28.987]  No more backing down.
[00:56:29.508 --> 00:56:29.928]  No more.
[00:56:30.888 --> 00:56:31.168]  No more.
[00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:32.748]  Because I never run white flags up.
[00:56:33.028 --> 00:56:38.110]  But I thought, used to, like, oh, we know you didn't say Sandy Hook was staged all the time.
[00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:39.370]  And we know you didn't create that.
[00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:40.530]  And we know you have a right to say it.
[00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.751]  But just say you're sorry because you think it happened.
[00:56:43.826 --> 00:56:45.427]  Once I looked into it, thought it happened.
[00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:48.889]  And then as soon as I said I thought it happened, that's when all hell broke loose.
[00:56:49.749 --> 00:56:51.670]  Because they think it's a white flag.
[00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:52.230]  No, no, no.
[00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:53.271]  No white flags.
[00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:54.351]  No, here, black flags.
[00:56:55.632 --> 00:56:56.132]  Black flags.
[00:56:57.233 --> 00:56:58.733]  We don't have a skull on our black flag.
[00:56:59.774 --> 00:57:00.614]  We just have a black flag.
[00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.596]  In fact, we have an InfoWars flag we sell in the store.
[00:57:03.616 --> 00:57:04.316]  I never even plug.
[00:57:04.376 --> 00:57:05.076]  It's a black flag.
[00:57:05.096 --> 00:57:07.077]  You know what black flags mean?
[00:57:07.918 --> 00:57:09.378]  It means no surrender.
[00:57:10.379 --> 00:57:12.180]  So if I have a symbol, it's a black flag.
[00:57:13.203 --> 00:57:14.223]  And it means no surrender.
[00:57:14.443 --> 00:57:18.465]  Now, a skull means we don't surrender, and when we win, we kill you.
[00:57:19.666 --> 00:57:23.167]  Now, if there's blood dripping out of the skull, that means we torture you.
[00:57:24.087 --> 00:57:26.008]  I don't... I don't play by those rules.
[00:57:26.748 --> 00:57:28.169]  We don't have a skull on our flag.
[00:57:28.869 --> 00:57:30.970]  It's just solid black.
[00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:34.171]  And it's flapping in the wind, and I know it scares you.
[00:57:35.092 --> 00:57:35.792]  No surrender!
[00:57:36.492 --> 00:57:37.633]  Death before dishonor!
[00:57:38.473 --> 00:57:39.233]  Victory or death!
[00:57:40.054 --> 00:57:40.934]  Live free or die!
[00:57:42.242 --> 00:57:43.483]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:44.603]  I didn't plug this whole time.
[00:57:44.883 --> 00:57:46.184]  Bunch of big sales are about to end.
[00:57:46.424 --> 00:57:47.325]  Incredible t-shirts.
[00:57:47.565 --> 00:57:49.866]  We need your financial support to fight the globalists.
[00:57:50.326 --> 00:57:51.307]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:02.881 --> 00:58:07.122]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:58:07.242 --> 00:58:08.043]  They are technocrats.
[00:58:08.303 --> 00:58:10.423]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:58:11.024 --> 00:58:17.886]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, it's in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:18.806 --> 00:58:20.267]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:22.809]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:29.554]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:30.474]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:58:30.955 --> 00:58:31.875]  I work a lot of hours.
[00:58:32.436 --> 00:58:37.419]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:47.066]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:58:48.047 --> 00:58:53.729]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:57.470]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:01.291]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:03.152]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[00:59:03.832 --> 00:59:06.173]  This is the next level.
[00:59:06.233 --> 00:59:07.353]  This is Ultra 12.
[00:59:07.773 --> 00:59:13.796]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:13.916 --> 00:59:16.697]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[00:59:17.057 --> 00:59:17.677]  It tastes great.
[00:59:18.037 --> 00:59:19.358]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[00:59:19.658 --> 00:59:20.358]  It is amazing.
[00:59:20.618 --> 00:59:28.281]  Experience pure Methicobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[00:59:28.741 --> 00:59:34.348]  At InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:34.548 --> 00:59:43.519]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're gonna find anywhere, and it funds the Info War, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[00:59:43.759 --> 00:59:47.163]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[00:59:56.303 --> 01:00:09.828]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:10.048 --> 01:00:12.068]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:12.448 --> 01:00:13.749]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:46.375]  You know, a lot of sports folks are about to do a long jump or a power lift.
[01:00:46.395 --> 01:00:54.057]  They envision themselves as incredibly powerful and invincible and hypnotize themselves with that archetype to be able to do things most people can never imagine.
[01:00:55.123 --> 01:00:56.464]  I don't do what I do out of power trips.
[01:00:57.144 --> 01:00:57.964]  Never have, never will.
[01:00:58.004 --> 01:01:04.968]  I do it because of the long-term vision of freedom and knowing that it's going to be more popular and work better than models of tyranny.
[01:01:06.328 --> 01:01:15.953]  But I do, like, do the archetype of Godzilla, cheesily in that plastic suit with all the little tanks, you know, shooting at him and everything, and he's, like, tearing down the system.
[01:01:16.633 --> 01:01:19.115]  I just kind of think about that that's kind of my archetype and my job.
[01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:22.796]  But it's more of a joke, but that's how the Democrats see me.
[01:01:23.477 --> 01:01:28.221]  It's like Godzilla coming in and attacking them and they just don't know what to do.
[01:01:28.301 --> 01:01:30.642]  So let's go in from the start again and we can play.
[01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:33.805]  Let's play some Blue Oyster Cult here for folks.
[01:01:33.825 --> 01:01:34.225]  Here it is.
[01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:41.331]  Didn't know that Blue Oyster Cult sounded so good.
[01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:43.052]  I actually like that.
[01:01:43.693 --> 01:01:46.215]  Godzilla dancing to Pesh mode.
[01:01:48.057 --> 01:01:48.517]  Crank it up.
[01:01:55.690 --> 01:02:01.872]  Better learn your lesson well.
[01:02:06.554 --> 01:02:07.035]  Yeah!
[01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:08.695]  Comes in full horse, baby.
[01:02:08.815 --> 01:02:09.996]  Gettin' Trump into office.
[01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:11.176]  Woo-hoo!
[01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:12.877]  Ha-ha-ha!
[01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:16.919]  The part about Godzilla is he always gets back up.
[01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:22.035]  He never gives in, never gives up.
[01:02:22.336 --> 01:02:26.398]  Sometimes he gives out, though.
[01:02:26.479 --> 01:02:29.040]  That's what the left sees us, folks.
[01:02:47.193 --> 01:02:53.177]  You know, the left's so brainwashed, now that I've blown up at about four or five restaurants, will they get in my face?
[01:02:54.117 --> 01:02:55.998]  Now, none of them will get up and do it anymore.
[01:02:56.018 --> 01:02:59.160]  Yeah, I'm not Ted Cruz.
[01:03:02.142 --> 01:03:10.247]  I'm not Mr. Tough either, but you know, you come over and tell me I'm gonna effin' kill you and spit on the back of my head or whatever, I'm gonna get up and say, all right, let's go.
[01:03:11.628 --> 01:03:12.689]  Yeah, there goes Hillary.
[01:03:13.429 --> 01:03:14.990]  Oh no, there goes 2016.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.141]  That's right, baby.
[01:03:20.721 --> 01:03:22.062]  My spirit animal's Godzilla.
[01:03:24.044 --> 01:03:24.644]  Gotta love it.
[01:03:26.786 --> 01:03:27.787]  And not the modern one.
[01:03:28.127 --> 01:03:37.614]  The goofy one.
[01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:41.457]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:45.829]  They say he's gotta go!
[01:03:46.009 --> 01:03:46.510]  Ban him!
[01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:47.171]  Remove him!
[01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:48.231]  Mute him!
[01:03:48.272 --> 01:03:49.373]  Just get rid of him!
[01:03:51.234 --> 01:03:52.736]  There goes Liberal Toe!
[01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:55.018]  Woo!
[01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:58.181]  Hey, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
[01:03:59.722 --> 01:04:02.184]  But I got some really bad family stuff going on right now.
[01:04:02.865 --> 01:04:05.347]  And I'm staying here and doing the show, but I'm having trouble focusing.
[01:04:06.148 --> 01:04:08.190]  So, we'll see how this turns out on the other side.
[01:04:10.717 --> 01:04:16.760]  Won't do any good if I go off air right now, so I just gotta sit here for the next hour, finish up, then see what's gonna happen.
[01:04:19.281 --> 01:04:20.941]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:04:22.002 --> 01:04:23.262]  Yeah, there's Trump's Godzilla.
[01:04:23.322 --> 01:04:24.463]  Exactly, they got it!
[01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:27.204]  The Godzilla frequency.
[01:04:28.845 --> 01:04:29.285]  Woo!
[01:04:31.866 --> 01:04:33.467]  Some good music video we just created.
[01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:36.548]  The Alex Jones Godzilla music video.
[01:04:39.318 --> 01:04:42.981]  And on every major platform in the world, but InfoWars.com.
[01:04:58.312 --> 01:04:59.073]  I'm gonna reset.
[01:04:59.093 --> 01:05:01.855]  We'll be right back at T-minus 60 Earth time seconds.
[01:05:04.244 --> 01:05:05.585]  We've not shut down our speech!
[01:05:05.865 --> 01:05:11.148]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:05:11.368 --> 01:05:18.312]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:05:18.872 --> 01:05:19.653]  Are you coming back?
[01:05:20.193 --> 01:05:21.594]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:21.954 --> 01:05:23.255]  We're at newswars.com.
[01:05:23.315 --> 01:05:25.517]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[01:05:25.537 --> 01:05:27.299]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:32.083]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[01:05:32.323 --> 01:05:34.545]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:05:34.565 --> 01:05:39.409]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:39.549]  Woo!
[01:05:40.922 --> 01:05:43.764]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[01:05:43.824 --> 01:05:45.064]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:05:45.505 --> 01:05:48.126]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:05:48.626 --> 01:05:50.407]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.929]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:05:53.969 --> 01:05:56.611]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:58.952]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:05:58.992 --> 01:05:59.752]  That's where they find it.
[01:05:59.772 --> 01:06:01.293]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:02.374]  Let's go there.
[01:06:14.505 --> 01:06:19.490]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:24.354]  Tell what you've got to tell.
[01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:54.512]  You can call this broadcast the Policy of Truth.
[01:06:55.693 --> 01:06:56.534]  That's all we do.
[01:06:56.554 --> 01:07:06.582]  A lot of folks got OCD to clean their pool every day or keep the refrigerator clean or have their car perfect or have their shirts all folded just right.
[01:07:07.302 --> 01:07:07.803]  Not me.
[01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.305]  I got OCD, telling the truth.
[01:07:11.686 --> 01:07:11.986]  I do.
[01:07:12.086 --> 01:07:12.987]  I really have it.
[01:07:13.888 --> 01:07:14.989]  I just can't help but do it.
[01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:20.172]  I could run circles around the establishment and Machiavellian lies of deception.
[01:07:20.752 --> 01:07:22.554]  But see, I don't do it.
[01:07:23.214 --> 01:07:24.215]  But I do expose it.
[01:07:24.836 --> 01:07:25.717]  And that's why they hate it.
[01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:30.661]  Now, this is an important little clip I want to get to here.
[01:07:33.513 --> 01:07:35.253]  Because it really illustrates a lot.
[01:07:35.353 --> 01:07:36.494]  Now, we've played this clip before.
[01:07:36.554 --> 01:07:38.494]  We have a new clip that's going to go with it in a moment.
[01:07:38.534 --> 01:07:52.618]  But this is AOC, the goddess, the deliverer, the Moses of free healthcare, free college, free housing, free jobs.
[01:07:52.978 --> 01:07:57.659]  She said in her Green Deal, you can work even if you get a paycheck, even if you don't want to work.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.280]  And all this other free stuff.
[01:08:02.489 --> 01:08:04.470]  So much free stuff, I can't even remember it all.
[01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:07.672]  Reparations, just... You name it, it's free!
[01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:09.933]  People say, well, where's it come from, it's free?
[01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:11.434]  She said, it's just gotta be free.
[01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:13.695]  We're just gonna do it.
[01:08:15.356 --> 01:08:17.298]  Well, that means somebody's gonna be a slave.
[01:08:18.018 --> 01:08:23.481]  Because if somebody over here doesn't have to work, and everybody else gets all this free stuff, well, who's gonna pay?
[01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:26.603]  Oh, like, almost everybody I know in my family.
[01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:31.604]  Who paid their taxes.
[01:08:32.465 --> 01:08:34.967]  Who the IRS at one time or another tried to take their house.
[01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:42.494]  How about that?
[01:08:42.514 --> 01:08:47.539]  Oh, but it's all free.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.722]  But remember, she said the world's gonna end in 12 years.
[01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:54.101]  If we don't pay them all the carbon tax.
[01:08:54.501 --> 01:09:01.126]  And everybody keeps pointing out, hey, they fly on private jets, they drive SUVs, she gets caught eating hamburgers when she says you shouldn't eat them.
[01:09:01.507 --> 01:09:02.107]  Don't you get it?
[01:09:02.127 --> 01:09:03.809]  They're not getting rid of airplanes and hamburgers.
[01:09:04.049 --> 01:09:07.311]  They're gonna put a tax on them that they get the money from!
[01:09:09.073 --> 01:09:10.074]  That's all this is?
[01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:13.356]  She knows damn well it's a lie, she's gonna guilt you!
[01:09:13.376 --> 01:09:16.599]  About that hamburger, about that hot dog.
[01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:17.700]  That's all that is?
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.602]  You know in some European countries,
[01:09:20.509 --> 01:09:23.533]  They torture the hell out of milk cows.
[01:09:25.275 --> 01:09:35.929]  They shove big old giant tubes up their butt, so that all the gas gets caught, because they say methane's bad, as if there hadn't been bovine all over the world forever.
[01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.753]  You know, cows are just domesticated water buffalo.
[01:09:39.793 --> 01:09:42.294]  The giant herds of them everywhere, from Russia to Africa.
[01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:44.134]  We used to have them here, we killed them all.
[01:09:44.734 --> 01:09:48.495]  There were species of, what, nine, ten different species of buffalo everywhere.
[01:09:48.735 --> 01:09:52.496]  There were probably more buffalo than there are cows now!
[01:09:53.416 --> 01:09:55.657]  There were cows all over the damn world!
[01:09:56.837 --> 01:09:57.997]  They just weren't domesticated.
[01:09:59.477 --> 01:10:01.998]  They were meaner than hell, but they were still cows.
[01:10:04.457 --> 01:10:20.209]  So, she wants the same thing Canada and Norway and Sweden are doing, where they chain these cows up and shove a big tube up their ass, I'm not kidding, and they collect the farts, because they say it's hurting the earth.
[01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:30.056]  Not toxic waste, not GMO, not genetically edited babies, not, not, no, no, no, no, not, not paying to have millions of kids change their sex and take deadly hormones.
[01:10:32.225 --> 01:10:39.471]  AOC says the world's ending, and Beto says the world's ending, unless you do exactly what they say.
[01:10:39.491 --> 01:10:40.652]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[01:10:43.154 --> 01:10:51.200]  There's examples, yeah, they have cows that are free range with the damn tubes up their ass, and I'm sorry to talk like that, but this is torturing these animals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:52.301 --> 01:10:59.506]  So, yeah, oh, a cow out there, the left wants to cut trees down, because they create carbon, too.
[01:11:00.543 --> 01:11:04.324]  You know, sunshine, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, that's the life cycle.
[01:11:04.945 --> 01:11:05.985]  Gotta have those four things.
[01:11:08.066 --> 01:11:12.467]  Daisy's like, will you please get this giant rubber hose out of my rear end?
[01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:14.208]  This is really going on!
[01:11:18.551 --> 01:11:19.692]  So here they are.
[01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:28.899]  Let me tell you, if you're ever in a church or anywhere and they tell you, do what we say or the world's going to end in five years or twelve years, you're in a cult.
[01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:31.921]  You need to run to the exits, okay?
[01:11:35.644 --> 01:11:37.866]  And that's what the Democratic Party is, is a cult.
[01:11:38.246 --> 01:11:41.849]  So let's play that clip before I play the latest with our reporter in New York.
[01:11:41.889 --> 01:11:42.269]  Here it is.
[01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:47.133]  I think that the part of it that is generational is that
[01:11:48.186 --> 01:12:02.345]  Millennials and people and you know Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is
[01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:08.335]  Your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?
[01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:10.175]  Yeah, let's just shove rubber hoses up cow's asses.
[01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:11.295]  This is the war.
[01:12:11.355 --> 01:12:12.636]  This is our World War II.
[01:12:13.736 --> 01:12:32.240]  And... We want to make sure that those who work in the oil and gas industry, those who work in the fossil fuel industry, are brought along as partners to make sure that we make this transition in the 10 years that we have left to us, as the science and scientists tell us, to make the kind of bold change that we need.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.801]  Now that's a powerful clip he just played.
[01:12:35.501 --> 01:12:36.462]  See if you can find the other one.
[01:12:36.642 --> 01:12:38.463]  No, no, it's him at night in a brick building.
[01:12:38.483 --> 01:12:40.724]  And he's like, the world's ending in 12 years!
[01:12:40.744 --> 01:12:41.764]  The point is he just said it again.
[01:12:42.345 --> 01:12:43.525]  Now, that's cult level.
[01:12:45.086 --> 01:12:46.447]  Now, the guys were able to find it.
[01:12:48.188 --> 01:12:54.291]  But, I mean, I could show you hundreds of articles in at least six countries I know of who are under a law.
[01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:58.893]  They shove big giant rubber hoses up the rear ends of cows.
[01:13:01.334 --> 01:13:02.715]  Because their farts are evil.
[01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:04.843]  You're like, that's crazy.
[01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:05.864]  Of course it's crazy.
[01:13:06.124 --> 01:13:07.965]  Cults make you do crazy things.
[01:13:09.306 --> 01:13:10.447]  The Marine Corps is a cult.
[01:13:10.988 --> 01:13:13.149]  It's a cult of death to win wars.
[01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:16.552]  So they make you do stupid chants and do stupid things to see if you'll do it.
[01:13:16.852 --> 01:13:18.433]  Okay, we permit that for war.
[01:13:18.714 --> 01:13:19.334]  And it's limited.
[01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:20.935]  It's still a cult.
[01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:22.056]  It's our cult.
[01:13:23.297 --> 01:13:29.242]  We've got the left coming in here with cults that don't have you masturbating with your rifle.
[01:13:30.854 --> 01:13:38.401]  So because part of your body, little secret Marine Corps thing, they have you shoving tubes up cow's butts.
[01:13:38.722 --> 01:13:40.984]  They have you thinking the world's ending in 12 years.
[01:13:41.324 --> 01:13:47.630]  The Marines have you believing we're going to adapt and overcome, we're going to win, we're going to live forever, even though we die, humanity goes on.
[01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:53.616]  They're telling you humanity's crap, humanity's going down the tubes, humanity's dead, it's over.
[01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:54.557]  No it's not!
[01:13:56.049 --> 01:13:59.553]  Let me give you the first few minutes of a 14-minute report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:14:00.213 --> 01:14:04.458]  New Yorkers accept banning of hot dogs to save the earth.
[01:14:04.778 --> 01:14:06.340]  And this isn't just cherry-picking.
[01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:11.606]  95% of them say ban hot dogs to save the earth.
[01:14:12.126 --> 01:14:12.507]  Here it is.
[01:14:13.376 --> 01:14:19.559]  So Mayor de Blasio, he's the mayor of New York City, he wants to ban hot dogs to fight climate change.
[01:14:19.739 --> 01:14:19.979]  Right.
[01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:20.839]  Does that make sense?
[01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:24.741]  I mean, would I give hot dogs away for climate security?
[01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:25.401]  Yes!
[01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:27.922]  You think politicians know what's best for you? 100%.
[01:14:44.343 --> 01:14:45.484]  And she gets a hot dog.
[01:14:45.884 --> 01:14:46.484]  Get ready to listen.
[01:14:46.544 --> 01:14:47.245]  I'm narrating this.
[01:14:48.385 --> 01:14:52.608]  And she goes around and she talked to like 50 people and two dudes were against it.
[01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:55.290]  Everybody else was like, yes, the government's right.
[01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:56.030]  Ban hot dogs.
[01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.430]  Continue.
[01:14:56.931 --> 01:14:58.752]  This costs $5.
[01:14:59.112 --> 01:15:04.715]  We're here in New York City where the mayor, Bill de Blasio, wants to ban hot dogs to fight climate change.
[01:15:04.735 --> 01:15:05.636]  Let's see what people think.
[01:15:08.881 --> 01:15:12.784]  The mayor of New York City wants to ban hot dogs to fight climate change.
[01:15:12.804 --> 01:15:13.344]  What do you think?
[01:15:13.705 --> 01:15:14.425]  Um, that's great.
[01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:16.867]  Yeah, you think it'll fix all the problems?
[01:15:17.027 --> 01:15:19.309]  Oh, um... Wait, wait, wait, what climate change?
[01:15:19.329 --> 01:15:21.951]  Yeah, he wants to ban hot dogs to fight climate change.
[01:15:21.971 --> 01:15:22.411]  What do you think?
[01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:22.971]  How does that work?
[01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.993]  I don't know.
[01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:25.834]  What do you think?
[01:15:27.775 --> 01:15:28.816]  We need hot dogs, I guess.
[01:15:28.836 --> 01:15:29.596]  I don't know, food.
[01:15:29.656 --> 01:15:30.897]  Do you know how much this cost me?
[01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:31.878]  A dollar?
[01:15:32.298 --> 01:15:33.119]  Five dollars.
[01:15:33.559 --> 01:15:34.680]  Without a drink?
[01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:35.701]  Yeah.
[01:15:36.728 --> 01:15:37.709]  Um, yeah.
[01:15:37.949 --> 01:15:39.511]  We're banning hot dogs.
[01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:42.534]  Yeah, let's ban hot dogs because they cost $5.
[01:15:42.594 --> 01:15:43.435]  There we go.
[01:15:43.615 --> 01:15:43.855]  Alright.
[01:15:44.115 --> 01:15:46.398]  What can we do to fight climate change in New York City?
[01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:50.161]  Um, no more hot dogs.
[01:15:50.602 --> 01:15:52.384]  Should we ban hot dogs to fight climate change?
[01:15:52.404 --> 01:15:52.444]  No.
[01:15:53.565 --> 01:15:53.945]  Why not?
[01:15:53.965 --> 01:15:55.667]  Because they taste good.
[01:15:55.827 --> 01:15:57.669]  Want to ban hot dogs to save the earth?
[01:15:58.009 --> 01:15:59.430]  I think it's kind of pointless to do.
[01:16:03.371 --> 01:16:11.160]  I scream, and it's like Google goes, I'm wearing a pink and a green sock, and I got a little beard, and I talk like this.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.721]  You know what those guys do when they get on jets?
[01:16:12.981 --> 01:16:17.807]  They go, bring me 15 hookers now, and get the drugs ready, and take me to private island.
[01:16:19.468 --> 01:16:20.770]  Get the satanic rituals ready.
[01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.355]  You don't just think the enemy has sleeper cells, do you?
[01:16:31.465 --> 01:16:36.846]  They've told me directly, if I don't want to be sued, if I don't want to be attacked, if I don't want to be, you name it, stop reporting on this.
[01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:40.027]  And guess what I'm going to say to the big bank and the New York Federal Reserve and everybody else?
[01:16:40.047 --> 01:16:41.207]  Here's what I have to say to them.
[01:16:41.587 --> 01:16:42.047]  Hey, you ready?
[01:16:42.067 --> 01:16:43.787]  This is what I'm saying to you right now.
[01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:45.167]  You got that message?
[01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:46.528]  Never going to stop.
[01:16:46.828 --> 01:16:48.248]  Never going to stop going to beat you too.
[01:16:50.528 --> 01:16:51.329]  We're in a fight here.
[01:16:51.349 --> 01:16:53.829]  I got like two battle axes fighting them.
[01:16:53.849 --> 01:16:54.809]  They're hacking at me.
[01:16:54.829 --> 01:16:55.669]  We're like, ah!
[01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:59.550]  But you don't want to come out of mommy's basement.
[01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:06.904]  You want to sit there and suck on your own little wee-wee and play video games and pretend like you're this big, you know, badass person.
[01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:09.046]  You're a soldier on the internet battling everybody.
[01:17:09.066 --> 01:17:13.028]  A lot of liberals have broken their conditioning because of it.
[01:17:13.048 --> 01:17:14.129]  Just keep making fun of me!
[01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:14.969]  Keep attacking!
[01:17:15.049 --> 01:17:15.629]  I love it!
[01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:16.830]  I'm totally destroying you!
[01:17:23.474 --> 01:17:24.234]  So 100 U.S.
[01:17:24.274 --> 01:17:27.436]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B. Is that true?
[01:17:27.456 --> 01:17:29.517]  You nailed that right there?
[01:17:29.537 --> 01:17:30.098]  Yes, yes.
[01:17:34.455 --> 01:17:36.680]  Oh man, you wanna fight, you're gonna get one.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:41.009]  I don't wanna lose my voice, I just want you to know.
[01:17:47.025 --> 01:17:52.027]  The majority of the frogs in most areas in the United States are now gay.
[01:17:52.707 --> 01:17:56.308]  But it's like a rape vape.
[01:17:56.829 --> 01:17:59.390]  You know, it looks all nice and candy, puppy.
[01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:00.870]  That's how they act all liberal.
[01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:03.011]  Oh my gosh, communism's really good.
[01:18:03.251 --> 01:18:03.911]  You're gonna like it.

[01:20:15.399 --> 01:20:16.940]  Something new.
[01:20:50.575 --> 01:20:52.177]  Let me read you a story here.
[01:20:52.217 --> 01:20:58.663]  It's just a bird's-eye view into the real world.
[01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:01.566]  I remember back in 1996, before the internet really was anything at all,
[01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:19.774]  Before streaming video, before anybody was really even trying to stream audio, we were doing it.
[01:21:20.755 --> 01:21:21.275]  The audio.
[01:21:23.236 --> 01:21:30.122]  And I remember opening the mail down at the radio station where I just started the show.
[01:21:30.142 --> 01:21:32.363]  It had become number one in just months in the city.
[01:21:33.004 --> 01:21:38.028]  But I was putting out of a shortwave, I was putting out of a satellite, the kind of little arrogant
[01:21:39.754 --> 01:21:50.287]  Managers because the guy that hired me was cool, but he left and went on He'd managed like CBS nationwide Xerox So he thought oh this guy will be great give him a show.
[01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:59.478]  He'll be on weekdays soon This guy's a real talent, but he he left he went on to manage other stuff and then all these weirdos that had never done anything were running it and
[01:21:59.838 --> 01:22:06.202]  And I'm like, oh yeah, I'm on like 20 stations now, and we're on satellite and shortwave over that ISDN line I paid to put in here.
[01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:08.383]  And they're like, oh yeah, kid.
[01:22:08.403 --> 01:22:10.505]  We let you put in an ISDN line and stuff.
[01:22:10.585 --> 01:22:15.067]  And sure, you're on other stations and satellite and shortwave.
[01:22:16.388 --> 01:22:18.590]  Then we get more and more jealous as we add top ratings.
[01:22:20.431 --> 01:22:26.154]  But I remember getting the mail, sometimes thousands of letters a week.
[01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:28.796]  So they started getting upset at the radio station.
[01:22:30.882 --> 01:22:36.143]  And they were getting piles, usually about 100 letters, sometimes 1,000.
[01:22:36.203 --> 01:22:45.566]  And I'll never forget opening up a newspaper clipping of an Associated Press article in a paper.
[01:22:46.426 --> 01:22:53.968]  And it said, Al Gore's refrigerator of blood spills on tarmac.
[01:22:54.975 --> 01:22:58.616]  Somebody ought to LexisNexis that or find it or Thomson's Reuters or something.
[01:22:58.976 --> 01:23:03.717]  And I covered it and it said he carried with him a little refrigerator full of blood.
[01:23:03.737 --> 01:23:08.138]  And then he did it because he got routine blood transfusions for his health.
[01:23:09.598 --> 01:23:11.519]  Now, I went on air and I covered that.
[01:23:12.699 --> 01:23:15.660]  And then I talked to some medical doctors I knew that had worked at the Air Force.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.880]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.600]  In the skunk's works.
[01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:22.001]  And they said, listen,
[01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:24.732]  Vampirism's real.
[01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:27.373]  It's a mental illness that happened all over the world.
[01:23:28.014 --> 01:23:31.495]  They also had basically skinwalkers they have Americans believed in.
[01:23:31.515 --> 01:23:37.037]  It was really when their own shaman would go crazy and become like vampires and lost after blood.
[01:23:37.437 --> 01:23:41.879]  It's like a pet cemetery and is an allegory of that.
[01:23:42.299 --> 01:23:45.700]  Even Stephen King admits, let's suppose a burial ground where they're burying the cats and dogs.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.220]  It's fiction.
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.181]  I'm not saying that's real.
[01:23:48.021 --> 01:23:53.344]  It would be, what's the term they use up in the Northwest for somebody who's turned into basically a vampire?
[01:23:53.364 --> 01:23:54.424]  I forget the exact term.
[01:23:55.365 --> 01:24:07.390]  But the point is, is that there's a real psychological designation that they had at Native American reservations where a certain number of people would go crazy and demand human blood.
[01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:14.354]  And if you wouldn't give it to them, they'd run off in the woods and come back emaciated six months later trying to kill you to get your blood.
[01:24:15.345 --> 01:24:19.329]  I didn't mean to go here today, I just saw this in the stack of news so I thought I would mention it.
[01:24:20.951 --> 01:24:25.416]  And when I went on those 20-something stations in shortwave,
[01:24:26.624 --> 01:24:35.726]  In 1996 and talked about that AP article and Al Gore with a refrigerator they carried around behind him full of blood for blood transfusions.
[01:24:36.566 --> 01:24:38.187]  Man, they got calls.
[01:24:38.267 --> 01:24:39.367]  They threatened to fire me.
[01:24:39.767 --> 01:24:41.127]  They said it was a conspiracy.
[01:24:41.628 --> 01:24:42.528]  They got pissed.
[01:24:42.588 --> 01:24:45.528]  That's when I first got on the Clinton's radar.
[01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:50.390]  But why did AP report on the refrigerator of blood?
[01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.790]  I don't know.
[01:24:54.210 --> 01:24:59.094]  So years later, I learned that rich people I knew were like, oh, that's no big deal.
[01:24:59.174 --> 01:25:00.956]  We all go get blood transfusions.
[01:25:01.016 --> 01:25:04.659]  And a lot of people put money in their college fund.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.381]  And I go, what do you mean?
[01:25:07.862 --> 01:25:14.627]  Well, we need the blood of preferably prepubescent below the age of 13.
[01:25:15.948 --> 01:25:20.432]  And in some jurisdictions, they have special doctors that allow the blood of children.
[01:25:20.452 --> 01:25:21.093]  But it's OK.
[01:25:21.473 --> 01:25:21.993]  It's healthy.
[01:25:23.191 --> 01:25:25.613]  And the kids can raise up to $500 per deal.
[01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:29.815]  And Alex, you really ought to try the blood, Alex.
[01:25:31.236 --> 01:25:31.897]  The blood.
[01:25:33.358 --> 01:25:36.860]  And these are people, you know, that I know, that are like conservatives.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.201]  They're like, the blood.
[01:25:38.221 --> 01:25:40.362]  I won't be trying that.
[01:25:41.023 --> 01:25:43.204]  Not to mention, I don't want somebody else's blood in me anyways.
[01:25:43.244 --> 01:25:45.426]  My God, my wife's spit in my mouth's enough.
[01:25:45.446 --> 01:25:45.906]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:48.579 --> 01:25:58.003]  Humans biohacking their own bodies with blood transfusions to achieve ditty immortality.
[01:26:01.044 --> 01:26:01.944]  Little immortality.
[01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:03.545]  DIY immortality.
[01:26:03.865 --> 01:26:06.386]  The point is, this is widespread now.
[01:26:07.546 --> 01:26:11.528]  And so if you're under 18, you know, it was 515 years ago, but it's like, if you're under 18, it's $1,000 a pint.
[01:26:16.789 --> 01:26:20.730]  Man, if you've got the weird deals and your parents take you, it's thousands if you're a little kid.
[01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:29.152]  There are people everywhere paying for children's blood to be run into their veins.
[01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:32.773]  And this has been going on forever.
[01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:38.274]  And Al Gore is followed around.
[01:26:39.074 --> 01:26:40.895]  You look at him, he's a big swollen vampire.
[01:26:40.915 --> 01:26:41.495]  You can see him.
[01:26:43.325 --> 01:26:44.106]  Adrenochrome, yeah.
[01:26:44.926 --> 01:26:51.430]  You can see this big swollen demon that is this big vampire bat.
[01:26:52.231 --> 01:26:53.611]  I mean, you know Kim Jong Un's got them.
[01:26:55.313 --> 01:26:56.633]  And you just look at them.
[01:26:57.314 --> 01:26:59.655]  By the way, scroll down to the InfoWars article for TV viewers.
[01:27:00.256 --> 01:27:04.078]  They took down the fan site we had that even had the adrenochrome.
[01:27:04.578 --> 01:27:05.759]  I guess somebody's got a backup there.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.521]  By the way, adrenochrome is in the encyclopedia.
[01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:11.583]  Adrenochrome is a real drug from people's adrenal glands.
[01:27:13.254 --> 01:27:15.735]  The Clintons actually own part of the company that puts it out.
[01:27:17.075 --> 01:27:18.476]  They're addicts, folks.
[01:27:19.436 --> 01:27:20.256]  Blood addicts.
[01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:27.359]  And in a child's blood is growth hormone and all these growth factors and all this stuff.
[01:27:27.979 --> 01:27:31.360]  And so we sit here and we talk about this all day.
[01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.501]  I know this show sounds crazy.
[01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:35.302]  I know this show sounds weird.
[01:27:36.207 --> 01:27:38.309]  I'm not the one, I'm not a great writer.
[01:27:38.969 --> 01:27:40.590]  I'm not a science fiction genius.
[01:27:41.211 --> 01:27:48.876]  They've got all these leftist sites that go, Jones is the greatest entertainer of the century though, and you've got to admit the stuff he comes up with is just unbelievable.
[01:27:48.916 --> 01:27:50.757]  He's better than Stephen King.
[01:27:50.777 --> 01:27:53.399]  No, no, no.
[01:27:53.739 --> 01:28:02.585]  You open the mail, and it's, he's got a refrigerator that fell down with a bunch of blood in it.
[01:28:04.386 --> 01:28:05.067]  I didn't write that.
[01:28:06.277 --> 01:28:09.618]  See, see, truth stranger than fiction.
[01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:24.084]  Like if I told you in 2019, most women's sports at the highest collegiate and even Olympic level is now being contended for or won by men who say they're women.
[01:28:24.124 --> 01:28:28.965]  They have different blood, they have different bones, different muscles, they have a different brain, different heart.
[01:28:29.045 --> 01:28:30.646]  It's all twice as strong as a woman.
[01:28:32.427 --> 01:28:33.167]  But they say
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.381]  That they are a girl, so they do.
[01:28:36.961 --> 01:28:39.603]  So, see, the sky's the limit.
[01:28:41.924 --> 01:28:46.947]  The sky's the limit to this evil, because we have acquiesced to anything.
[01:28:48.928 --> 01:28:55.352]  So the biggest boom economy in America now is children's blood injected in rich people's veins.
[01:28:56.413 --> 01:28:58.254]  I told you this 20 years ago.
[01:28:58.914 --> 01:28:59.394]  Stay with us.
[01:29:12.276 --> 01:29:12.897]  We're good to go.
[01:29:29.608 --> 01:29:30.889]  Ourselves and build our own infrastructure.
[01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:32.850]  It's been hard, but we did an analysis.
[01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:36.732]  We're like, yeah, we've been sold out of Secret 12, which is super high quality.
[01:29:36.792 --> 01:29:38.993]  Methylcobalamin does incredible things for the body.
[01:29:39.033 --> 01:29:40.474]  You have to have B12 to live.
[01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:42.475]  Because if B12 goes out, you can't absorb it.
[01:29:42.515 --> 01:29:43.215]  You're bye-bye.
[01:29:43.455 --> 01:29:49.438]  B12's only really naturally in some things like seal meat or things like mushrooms.
[01:29:49.578 --> 01:29:50.178]  You like Secret 12?
[01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:53.000]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.561]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:29:54.781 --> 01:29:56.821]  Most expensive vitamin B12.
[01:29:56.921 --> 01:29:57.662]  Methylcobalamin.
[01:29:57.842 --> 01:29:59.762]  So you take it, you put it under your tongue.
[01:29:59.782 --> 01:30:02.323]  It's good for children and very important for over 40s.
[01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.184]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[01:30:04.284 --> 01:30:05.585]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[01:30:05.605 --> 01:30:11.007]  Because if you just drink it down, you don't get that much absorption in your intestines, in your stomach, in your upper and lower intestine.
[01:30:11.027 --> 01:30:12.027]  Of course, your stomach above that.
[01:30:12.227 --> 01:30:17.891]  So what I'm getting at here is B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[01:30:17.931 --> 01:30:19.252]  Just like oxygen, just like water.
[01:30:19.572 --> 01:30:22.535]  And so many types you go to the store are synthetic.
[01:30:22.695 --> 01:30:24.196]  They're not absorbable by the body.
[01:30:24.296 --> 01:30:27.638]  You take these pills and it doesn't do almost anything.
[01:30:27.739 --> 01:30:31.922]  The point is, it's amazing, you need it, it's awesome, and it's the absolute go-to.
[01:30:31.942 --> 01:30:33.243]  By the way, it tastes super sweet.
[01:30:33.383 --> 01:30:35.224]  It's nothing but pure methylcobalamin.
[01:30:35.324 --> 01:30:38.386]  That's what B12 in its real form tastes like.
[01:30:38.807 --> 01:30:41.269]  It's a reddish, beautiful, almost purple,
[01:30:42.113 --> 01:30:43.594]  I don't know what color it is.
[01:30:43.614 --> 01:30:44.795]  It's just an amazing color.
[01:30:44.835 --> 01:30:48.118]  It has its own... Maybe do a document cam shot for TV viewers.
[01:30:48.599 --> 01:30:52.342]  It's got its own... Look at that color.
[01:30:53.583 --> 01:30:56.305]  It's got its own just... You've never seen a red like that.
[01:30:57.226 --> 01:30:58.487]  There's no coloring in that.
[01:30:58.527 --> 01:31:01.370]  There's no... There's nothing on there that's got that red color.
[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:02.971]  I mean, you gotta see it for yourself.
[01:31:03.011 --> 01:31:04.132]  It's just amazing.
[01:31:08.903 --> 01:31:13.886]  And again, when I forget about this, and when I forget about taking the products, I feel like crap.
[01:31:14.107 --> 01:31:15.568]  But when I take it, I feel great.

[01:31:45.489 --> 01:31:45.789]  Ultra 12.
[01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:47.751]  Advanced vitamin B12.

[01:32:13.924 --> 01:32:17.746]  And I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:32:18.267 --> 01:32:19.247]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:32:19.747 --> 01:32:25.791]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:32:26.231 --> 01:32:28.132]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[01:32:28.712 --> 01:32:29.413]  I'm not the leader.
[01:32:29.733 --> 01:32:30.334]  You are the leader.
[01:32:30.534 --> 01:32:32.116]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:32:32.516 --> 01:32:37.301]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfowarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:32:37.922 --> 01:32:45.429]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:46.711]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:32:47.071 --> 01:32:47.971]  I want to encourage you again.
[01:32:48.472 --> 01:32:53.153]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:32:53.393 --> 01:32:56.154]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[01:32:56.534 --> 01:32:58.435]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:32:58.655 --> 01:33:01.616]  God bless you.
[01:33:06.238 --> 01:33:08.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:31.891]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:32.272 --> 01:33:33.813]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.953 --> 01:33:36.415]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:36.735 --> 01:33:41.199]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:33:41.459 --> 01:33:41.679]  Okay.
[01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:51.133]  As often happens, we've done a pretty good broadcast the last hour and a half, but Sunday's only two hours long.
[01:33:52.494 --> 01:33:54.795]  And I haven't gotten into 10% of what I got prepared for.
[01:33:54.855 --> 01:33:56.636]  I mean, I've got a lot of preparation here.
[01:33:57.997 --> 01:33:58.498]  But you know what?
[01:33:58.518 --> 01:34:00.199]  I'm gonna throw it all to the side right now.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.301]  Because I just want to say this right now.
[01:34:06.803 --> 01:34:07.623]  The Bible's real.
[01:34:08.804 --> 01:34:09.885]  Jesus Christ is real.
[01:34:12.182 --> 01:34:15.125]  And I don't come by that being brainwashed in some establishment church.
[01:34:16.486 --> 01:34:23.813]  I come by that by experiencing how the world really works, and how the enemy hates Christians, and who the enemy really works for.
[01:34:23.853 --> 01:34:31.761]  Because when you actually read the Bible, it's not what you get from mainline churches or Hollywood, it's something completely different.
[01:34:32.121 --> 01:34:36.065]  It's a road map of how the world really works, and if you actually follow it,
[01:34:38.652 --> 01:34:42.675]  You've got a roadmap to what they're going to try on you, and you've basically got the playbook.
[01:34:43.396 --> 01:34:46.258]  You don't have to steal the playbook like the Patriots do to win.
[01:34:46.278 --> 01:34:47.519]  Of course, everybody does it.
[01:34:47.539 --> 01:34:48.500]  I'm not defending it.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.901]  They're just the best at it.
[01:34:51.522 --> 01:34:54.584]  You don't have to, you know, everybody was cheating like Lance Armstrong.
[01:34:54.924 --> 01:34:55.705]  He was just the best at it.
[01:34:57.286 --> 01:34:58.147]  I'm not defending that either.
[01:34:59.892 --> 01:35:01.994]  But God gave us a cheat sheet here.
[01:35:02.474 --> 01:35:08.099]  And you know, you're growing up and you hear, oh, there's a devil and he wants to kill you and he wants to steal from you and he wants to hurt children.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.982]  And the devil's obsessed with corrupting or killing children.
[01:35:13.484 --> 01:35:15.526]  And you're like, looking at yourself, you're like, well, I don't want to do that.
[01:35:15.566 --> 01:35:17.428]  I don't believe that kind of person exists.
[01:35:17.728 --> 01:35:19.550]  In fact, there was a clip I was going to play on Friday.
[01:35:19.570 --> 01:35:22.352]  Can you guys give me Friday's video list?
[01:35:23.193 --> 01:35:26.416]  I saw like some NBC or ABC clip of a serial killer.
[01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:31.337]  Who would just climb in little girls' windows at nights and slit their throats.
[01:35:31.377 --> 01:35:32.657]  And I remember hearing about it in the 90s.
[01:35:33.457 --> 01:35:35.498]  And people ask, like, how can there be evil?
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.080]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:35:41.101 --> 01:35:41.881]  I need to print out those.
[01:35:41.921 --> 01:35:43.642]  I want to get his name in the background, if you can.
[01:35:43.662 --> 01:35:43.902]  Thanks.
[01:35:44.602 --> 01:35:46.463]  He finally got executed, I guess, here in Texas.
[01:35:47.304 --> 01:35:49.905]  But you ask yourself, how is this going on?
[01:35:50.205 --> 01:35:56.728]  Because you don't want to climb in a second-story window and slit little girls' throats.
[01:35:58.061 --> 01:36:02.682]  So you don't think that exists because you're not like that.
[01:36:02.822 --> 01:36:04.582]  And I really get it.
[01:36:05.703 --> 01:36:05.983]  I do.
[01:36:07.003 --> 01:36:09.223]  I like feeding puppy dogs, little kitty cats.
[01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:10.183]  I like cooking dinner.
[01:36:10.524 --> 01:36:11.824]  I like having friends over.
[01:36:12.324 --> 01:36:13.704]  I'm a real nice, sweet person.
[01:36:14.624 --> 01:36:16.285]  I would never think about hurting anybody.
[01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:21.666]  But there are people like that all over the place.
[01:36:22.006 --> 01:36:24.686]  And we have to stop being weak.
[01:36:26.127 --> 01:36:27.347]  And we got to start being strong.
[01:36:28.618 --> 01:36:30.819]  And stop denying that this type of stuff's going on.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:35.141]  And we've got to start being willing to get in a fight if we have to.
[01:36:38.082 --> 01:36:38.803]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:36:41.404 --> 01:36:48.047]  Is that we've got to stop giving in to evil by denying it exists because it does exist.
[01:36:48.127 --> 01:36:52.769]  And listen, I don't say this with pleasure.
[01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:57.531]  I have reporters in California.
[01:36:59.349 --> 01:37:08.839]  And in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in New York, in Florida, in Texas, in Missouri, in Minnesota.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.124]  And I've got Auxiliary Reporters all over the world, in Europe, and you name it.
[01:37:16.586 --> 01:37:17.748]  And they'll send in a video.
[01:37:19.252 --> 01:37:26.476]  Of hundreds of people calling for the end of America, the end of Europe, for total communism, for total capitulation to Islam.
[01:37:27.076 --> 01:37:30.098]  And I say, did you cut out the smart people?
[01:37:31.539 --> 01:37:34.000]  They always say, no, we found none.
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.081]  Or, you saw the one.
[01:37:38.963 --> 01:37:43.386]  And that's the thing here is, I watch the Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett videos.
[01:37:43.446 --> 01:37:45.507]  I watch the Will Johnson videos.
[01:37:49.195 --> 01:37:50.916]  And they can talk to 50 people.
[01:37:53.458 --> 01:37:59.201]  And they might find one that acts like they haven't had a full frontal lobotomy.
[01:38:01.462 --> 01:38:06.085]  They say, hey, the mayor wants to ban hot dogs to save the earth.
[01:38:07.366 --> 01:38:12.209]  And they go, I think that's a good idea.
[01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:18.873]  I mean, what the hell happened to these people?
[01:38:23.686 --> 01:38:24.727]  I don't care if they're black.
[01:38:24.907 --> 01:38:25.827]  I don't care if they're white.
[01:38:27.228 --> 01:38:28.308]  I don't care if they were Hispanic.
[01:38:29.329 --> 01:38:33.731]  When I was growing up, nobody bought into the system.
[01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:40.454]  Even if you thought the local cop was okay, or the local city person, you knew above it was some corruption.
[01:38:41.114 --> 01:38:42.094]  You had an instinct.
[01:38:42.695 --> 01:38:43.855]  That's an American instinct.
[01:38:44.355 --> 01:38:46.757]  Man, it's gone, folks.
[01:38:47.497 --> 01:38:49.318]  Why do you think they're censoring all the patriots?
[01:38:49.358 --> 01:38:51.839]  Because people don't have an instinct to defend it!
[01:38:55.322 --> 01:38:58.124]  So I don't say it with some sense of pleasure.
[01:39:02.808 --> 01:39:04.530]  That, oh my God, look at these people.
[01:39:05.391 --> 01:39:11.096]  But would the globalists, though, see it as a sense of empowerment?
[01:39:12.157 --> 01:39:13.838]  That the public is so dumbed down?
[01:39:14.719 --> 01:39:16.480]  That the public is so enslaved?
[01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:21.805]  That the public is so soulless?
[01:39:23.957 --> 01:39:25.378]  But I know how the universe works.
[01:39:26.079 --> 01:39:37.347]  Even if I was a Machiavellian Satanist, if I'm in this ether with all these other consciousnesses, and they're being lowered and destroyed, I can't help but be grabbed by that black hole.
[01:39:38.487 --> 01:39:39.848]  The Satanist doesn't get that.
[01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:46.293]  The person that's all about themselves thinks, oh, I found somebody I can rip off and steal from.
[01:39:48.404 --> 01:39:59.150]  But you don't get, when you're a thug, let's say, robbing the neighborhood, robbing some houses, carjacking somebody, that you just drove all the property values down, that you just drove everybody out of the city.
[01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:01.111]  That's a microcosm of this, you see?
[01:40:04.233 --> 01:40:07.415]  Evil doesn't get... An evil person, I describe as the...
[01:40:08.553 --> 01:40:09.454]  Swimming pool pooper.
[01:40:09.474 --> 01:40:12.056]  A lot of Islamists do this in Europe.
[01:40:12.096 --> 01:40:13.197]  They say they're allowed to.
[01:40:13.237 --> 01:40:13.837]  It's their culture.
[01:40:14.418 --> 01:40:15.359]  They defecate.
[01:40:15.419 --> 01:40:16.520]  They don't piss in the pool.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.481]  They defecate in the pool.
[01:40:22.665 --> 01:40:27.589]  Now, you'd think you want to go to a pool yourself, a public pool, so there's people defecating in it.
[01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:28.910]  It'll be closed or dirty.
[01:40:29.631 --> 01:40:34.375]  But see, they don't have second degree, third degree, fourth degree dimensional thought.
[01:40:35.422 --> 01:40:45.028]  It's, I'm gonna be selfish, I'm gonna take a big old crap right in this pool, and then I'm gonna get out and watch everybody horrified by it and giggle and walk off.
[01:40:45.488 --> 01:40:46.969]  It doesn't matter if the pool closes.
[01:40:47.249 --> 01:40:49.010]  It doesn't matter if I can't come here for a week.
[01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:59.816]  I'm gonna exercise my little petty power now, and not worry about the consequences to myself and others down the road.
[01:41:00.457 --> 01:41:02.058]  And that's the essence of evil.
[01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:04.885]  Is that it's one-dimensional.
[01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:06.407]  It's stupid.
[01:41:08.148 --> 01:41:08.769]  Take a virus.
[01:41:09.249 --> 01:41:09.970]  A cancer virus.
[01:41:11.791 --> 01:41:13.233]  They argue, is it alive, is it dead?
[01:41:13.593 --> 01:41:14.254]  It's RNA.
[01:41:14.714 --> 01:41:19.779]  It goes... plugs into your DNA.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:22.301]  Programs.
[01:41:28.246 --> 01:41:30.048]  Your cell to replicate it.
[01:41:37.409 --> 01:41:40.150]  Your body tries to fight against it.
[01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:46.693]  But the truth is, it doesn't even have a consciousness.
[01:41:54.577 --> 01:41:55.257]  It doesn't care.
[01:41:55.277 --> 01:41:57.698]  Because it doesn't know.
[01:41:57.718 --> 01:42:00.599]  You keep trying to reason with it.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.500]  It's a virus.
[01:42:05.081 --> 01:42:06.222]  It's failed information.
[01:42:07.233 --> 01:42:08.513]  But it's reprogramming.
[01:42:09.294 --> 01:42:10.494]  It's controlling life.
[01:42:10.674 --> 01:42:21.598]  It takes it over and then finally the cell swells up and busts open and 900,000 viruses pour back out and start infecting everything else.
[01:42:22.399 --> 01:42:23.019]  That's what they do.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:28.661]  And so that's the nature of this.
[01:42:30.615 --> 01:42:37.096]  And you try to reason with it, you try to appease it, you try all this SJW, Stockholm Syndrome crap with it.
[01:42:37.296 --> 01:42:43.177]  You don't reason with something come to rewrite you and take you over and kill you.
[01:42:44.978 --> 01:42:47.858]  And so you wonder why these people all of a sudden are so dumb.
[01:42:48.238 --> 01:42:51.719]  So, because they've given in to a spiritual virus.
[01:42:52.619 --> 01:42:54.939]  Now there's a new suppressed film about to come out in four days.
[01:42:55.519 --> 01:42:56.820]  We've got the exclusive trailer.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.380]  We're gonna play it when we come back.
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:42:59.040]  Please stay with us.
[01:43:02.748 --> 01:43:15.353]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:43:16.794 --> 01:43:22.976]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[01:43:23.236 --> 01:43:25.197]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[01:43:26.057 --> 01:43:27.378]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what
[01:43:28.046 --> 01:43:30.529]  Everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:36.296]  But then you add, not to the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[01:43:36.996 --> 01:43:37.377]  Literally.
[01:43:38.118 --> 01:43:45.326]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known.
[01:43:46.267 --> 01:43:46.567]  I think?
[01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:09.262]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[01:44:09.922 --> 01:44:14.224]  It's 50% off right now at Infolwerestore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:44:14.604 --> 01:44:17.105]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:23.668]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that has taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[01:44:24.368 --> 01:44:27.569]  Now, this is high quality and it's very thick, so doing it with a spoon takes a while.
[01:44:27.729 --> 01:44:28.950]  That's why I like to use a blender.
[01:44:32.191 --> 01:44:36.413]  Again, I love it with milk.
[01:44:37.662 --> 01:44:38.603]  Bang this baby back.
[01:44:45.888 --> 01:44:47.029]  Nothing like it for a meal replacement.
[01:44:47.049 --> 01:44:48.711]  It's way beyond any way you've ever had.
[01:44:48.731 --> 01:44:54.875]  Again, it's got the essence of the bones, the chaga mushroom, the turmeric, a bunch of other incredible stuff.
[01:44:55.356 --> 01:44:58.058]  This is what fuels patriots.
[01:44:58.078 --> 01:44:59.719]  This is what fuels people that really want to be healthy.
[01:45:00.119 --> 01:45:02.001]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:45:30.092 --> 01:45:32.113]  Available in two refreshing flavors.
[01:45:32.233 --> 01:45:36.814]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.

[01:45:49.437 --> 01:45:53.238]  Support good oral health with our one of a kind super blue products.

[01:46:31.817 --> 01:46:34.238]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[01:46:34.398 --> 01:46:35.419]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:46:36.079 --> 01:46:38.760]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.842]  But they said, look, when you do plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[01:46:41.982 --> 01:46:42.682]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[01:46:42.742 --> 01:46:43.403]  Well, you know what?
[01:46:43.523 --> 01:46:44.704]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[01:46:44.784 --> 01:46:46.745]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[01:46:46.765 --> 01:46:47.645]  We decided to change the name.
[01:46:47.725 --> 01:46:48.946]  So when you peel off the label,
[01:46:50.174 --> 01:46:52.296]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[01:46:53.877 --> 01:46:56.519]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[01:46:56.679 --> 01:46:58.281]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.
[01:46:58.301 --> 01:47:01.503]  InfoWarsTore.com, now back in stock after four months sold out.
[01:47:05.687 --> 01:47:08.309]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.783 --> 01:47:29.267]  For somebody that's always saying I need your financial support and help, I tend to not even plug sometimes for a whole broadcast of the products we sell.
[01:47:30.268 --> 01:47:31.008]  But you know what?
[01:47:31.068 --> 01:47:32.989]  If folks don't think we need support, it's up to you.
[01:47:51.721 --> 01:47:54.802]  Whether we're going to be here or not, folks, it really comes down to that.
[01:47:58.642 --> 01:48:00.203]  Here's a trailer for a new documentary.
[01:48:00.223 --> 01:48:04.744]  It's up on newswars.com.
[01:48:04.764 --> 01:48:07.284]  It's an important film.
[01:48:10.385 --> 01:48:11.025]  We're ready for it.
[01:48:11.065 --> 01:48:11.585]  I'll play it.
[01:48:12.245 --> 01:48:12.865]  You're ready for it.
[01:48:13.346 --> 01:48:14.646]  Just go to newswars.com.
[01:48:16.126 --> 01:48:19.607]  Purge victim Laura Loomer featured a new film on censorship.
[01:48:19.627 --> 01:48:20.027]  Here it is.
[01:48:21.338 --> 01:48:25.843]  Tonight we present this special report on social media exclusion.
[01:48:25.863 --> 01:48:30.929]  He calls Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American.
[01:48:31.618 --> 01:48:34.700]  Listen, this is not just targeting one side of the political spectrum.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:40.644]  This is the first time that the high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:48:40.904 --> 01:48:41.745]  This is a monopoly.
[01:48:42.065 --> 01:48:43.106]  There is no competition.
[01:48:43.606 --> 01:48:44.647]  And there's no accountability.
[01:48:44.667 --> 01:48:47.549]  Facebook or Google are not government actors.
[01:48:47.729 --> 01:48:49.930]  So the First Amendment does not speak to their conduct.
[01:48:50.271 --> 01:48:54.794]  Certain voices and messages should be excluded from their platforms.
[01:48:57.796 --> 01:48:59.097]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:48:59.957 --> 01:49:00.958]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:49:04.295 --> 01:49:08.078]  This is not a lifestyle for people who are weak-minded.
[01:49:08.158 --> 01:49:12.741]  I mean, I didn't just get depressed, I felt straight-up suicidal.
[01:49:13.962 --> 01:49:21.348]  Very soon, time soon, then the relocation of my family will be needed.
[01:49:21.668 --> 01:49:28.593]  I wake up, the first thing I do before I talk to anyone, before I turn on my phone, is go on my YouTube channel and make sure it's still there.
[01:49:29.174 --> 01:49:31.355]  I mean, I lost my job, I lost...
[01:49:32.355 --> 01:49:35.458]  My social media platforms have lost my vocation in a sense.
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:40.162]  If we don't fight back and if we don't do something soon...
[01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:42.871]  I'm worried that we may fall.
[01:49:43.011 --> 01:49:47.853]  We may lose what makes this country great, and that is the fact that we have free speech.
[01:49:48.313 --> 01:49:55.435]  The government cannot broadly restrict anything that it might label hate speech, but platforms can if they wish to.
[01:49:55.515 --> 01:49:59.136]  I talk about YouTube, the second biggest search engine in the world.
[01:49:59.156 --> 01:50:04.657]  The more they try and censor the people who are the alternative, the more frustration they will build against them.
[01:50:05.257 --> 01:50:11.040]  A progressive publisher fears those on the left like her may soon face the very same hurdles as conservatives.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:14.822]  I was used as the straw man.
[01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:22.306]  Once the public took the bait, took the hook in their mouth, then everyone else would fall.
[01:50:22.646 --> 01:50:23.227]  We were winning.
[01:50:25.028 --> 01:50:25.448]  We're losing.
[01:50:30.803 --> 01:50:37.668]  So, there is a link up on Infowars.com, and we're going to show you Newswars.com.
[01:50:38.648 --> 01:50:40.730]  Right there on Newswars.com.
[01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:44.592]  Purge victim Laura Loomer featured a new film on censorship.
[01:50:45.133 --> 01:50:47.614]  You Can't Watch This will be released on May 15th.
[01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:52.518]  And I guess it was about six months ago I got interviewed by some British filmmakers.
[01:50:53.598 --> 01:50:56.360]  One liberal, one conservative, and I got interviewed again a couple months ago by them.
[01:50:56.901 --> 01:50:59.983]  And they interviewed Tommy Robinson, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer.
[01:51:00.743 --> 01:51:01.703]  And a bunch of other people.
[01:51:01.743 --> 01:51:02.924]  And I've seen the film.
[01:51:03.024 --> 01:51:04.084]  It's very powerful.
[01:51:04.704 --> 01:51:07.905]  It's perfect timing with all the censorship that's going on.
[01:51:08.585 --> 01:51:11.386]  And so if you go to newswars.com, you can watch the trailer.
[01:51:12.046 --> 01:51:20.128]  And then right there in the second paragraph, you can click on, you can't watch this, which is the name of the film.
[01:51:21.428 --> 01:51:24.069]  And that's how people can go find
[01:51:27.737 --> 01:51:31.740]  The film and where it's going to be shown.
[01:51:33.661 --> 01:51:38.084]  So, again, I've been a little under the weather here and had some family stuff going on today.
[01:51:38.924 --> 01:51:41.626]  Probably shouldn't even have come into the show tomorrow, but I'll give you this commitment.
[01:51:41.646 --> 01:51:44.148]  I'm going to come in here and give you a real broadcast tomorrow, okay?
[01:51:44.168 --> 01:51:46.710]  In fact, I'm going to come in here at 5 a.m.
[01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:50.032]  and I'm going to plot every minute of the show.
[01:51:50.052 --> 01:51:55.936]  I'm going to have it all, instead of everything spread out, I'm going to have everything linear, stacked like this, so we can just go,
[01:52:06.667 --> 01:52:06.968]  That way.
[01:52:08.308 --> 01:52:08.589]  That way.
[01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:11.811]  Because I'm the reason this show has problems.
[01:52:12.131 --> 01:52:12.471]  It's me.
[01:52:14.052 --> 01:52:17.835]  But I'm gonna get my act together, and I'm gonna get it straight.
[01:52:19.196 --> 01:52:23.278]  Because we're gonna win, and we're gonna defeat these globalists.
[01:52:24.519 --> 01:52:26.761]  But anyways, I'm glad to see this film's popping up.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:35.262]  It's well done, and I hope that people will go to try to see the film that premieres this Wednesday.
[01:52:36.442 --> 01:52:37.462]  You can't watch this.
[01:52:37.962 --> 01:52:43.884]  And maybe tomorrow, think about this, we may even have a URL for you.
[01:52:45.124 --> 01:52:45.884]  Think about that.
[01:52:45.904 --> 01:52:51.106]  I bet in 24 hours, I bet I can get a URL
[01:52:57.683 --> 01:52:58.203]  Maybe not.
[01:52:59.824 --> 01:53:00.504]  No, no, no, no.
[01:53:00.564 --> 01:53:01.645]  News Wars is there.
[01:53:01.665 --> 01:53:02.945]  Let me see.
[01:53:04.506 --> 01:53:05.907]  You see how it works?
[01:53:06.487 --> 01:53:07.848]  I know about News Wars.
[01:53:08.788 --> 01:53:10.169]  I'm not saying that, see.
[01:53:11.369 --> 01:53:16.992]  I'm talking about the URL where you see the movie.
[01:53:18.672 --> 01:53:19.573]  You can't watch this.
[01:53:19.653 --> 01:53:20.813]  See that link right there?
[01:53:22.874 --> 01:53:23.995]  Just click on that.
[01:53:26.277 --> 01:53:30.099]  And then now minimize it and tell me the URL.
[01:53:31.399 --> 01:53:36.962]  And I'm about to be literally transferred to Valhalla right now.
[01:53:39.063 --> 01:53:39.963]  So let's blow that up.
[01:53:42.925 --> 01:53:44.846]  Because I can't read that distance.
[01:53:45.926 --> 01:53:47.507]  Or maybe just say in my ear what it is.
[01:53:49.272 --> 01:53:51.854]  We'll just run some Jeopardy music here.
[01:53:52.134 --> 01:53:53.975]  This is what it's all about right here, though, isn't it?
[01:53:54.335 --> 01:53:55.596]  What it's all about, baby.
[01:53:56.256 --> 01:53:58.397]  Because, man, I got a TV way across that room.
[01:53:58.457 --> 01:53:59.498]  I can't read that URL.
[01:54:03.191 --> 01:54:05.733]  So we're just gonna lay back and just roll with it, baby.
[01:54:05.753 --> 01:54:07.035]  Just roll with it all.
[01:54:07.475 --> 01:54:08.696]  Death of civilization.
[01:54:09.116 --> 01:54:10.418]  Sexualization of our kids.
[01:54:10.978 --> 01:54:12.399]  Killing babies after they're born.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:12.880]  All of it.
[01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:15.302]  Everything's just fun.
[01:54:15.362 --> 01:54:16.403]  Everything's nice.
[01:54:17.304 --> 01:54:19.686]  Everything's just so cool and fun about it.
[01:54:19.706 --> 01:54:21.588]  We just do it.
[01:54:21.628 --> 01:54:22.389]  We just lay back.
[01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:25.632]  Wow, look at that.
[01:54:25.752 --> 01:54:27.533]  YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[01:54:27.613 --> 01:54:27.874]  Wow.
[01:54:29.232 --> 01:54:30.833]  My life just got completed, man.
[01:54:31.693 --> 01:54:33.614]  We put a URL on the screen, baby.
[01:54:42.477 --> 01:54:47.259]  So, like I said, can we just go back to the page and blow up the URL in the corner?
[01:54:50.901 --> 01:54:51.721]  So I can show that to people.
[01:54:51.741 --> 01:54:55.002]  I mean, I'm cool here, whatever.
[01:54:55.022 --> 01:54:56.623]  At this point.
[01:54:57.683 --> 01:54:58.804]  Go to newswars.com.
[01:55:00.418 --> 01:55:01.539]  You can see the first trailer for it.
[01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:08.645]  Maybe scroll down to the second paragraph and click.
[01:55:08.665 --> 01:55:09.406]  You can't watch this.
[01:55:11.228 --> 01:55:16.553]  And then if you just blow up the URL in the corner, we can just show.
[01:55:17.854 --> 01:55:18.715]  Can Dan do that?
[01:55:18.755 --> 01:55:20.937]  Can you do that?
[01:55:20.957 --> 01:55:21.257]  Can you?
[01:55:25.681 --> 01:55:27.583]  Alright, I'm gonna end the show like this for y'all.
[01:55:27.623 --> 01:55:29.625]  Folks, hope you have a great day out there.
[01:55:30.046 --> 01:55:33.569]  Be sure to take your shots, drink your fluoride, and enjoy giving your soul up.
[01:55:33.609 --> 01:55:35.051]  Most of you are already dead anyways.
[01:55:35.912 --> 01:55:37.213]  Let's end it with a few minutes from this.
[01:55:37.253 --> 01:55:38.314]  I'll play this all tomorrow.
[01:55:38.634 --> 01:55:40.656]  Inside the mind of a murdering psychopath.
[01:55:40.716 --> 01:55:41.257]  ABC.
[01:55:41.277 --> 01:55:43.499]  So you just know who's coming for you and your family.
[01:55:43.539 --> 01:55:43.839]  Here it is.
[01:55:45.101 --> 01:55:48.783]  The first time I killed somebody, it was such a rush.
[01:55:49.324 --> 01:55:53.426]  Tommy Lynn Salms, one of the most infamous serial killers in modern history.
[01:55:54.007 --> 01:55:56.548]  A man who says he belongs on death row.
[01:55:57.249 --> 01:55:58.789]  I was raised to do time.
[01:55:59.930 --> 01:56:04.353]  I wasn't raised to live out there in that world.
[01:56:05.003 --> 01:56:09.964]  Sells was convicted of killing 13-year-old Katie Harris, stabbing her to death in her bedroom.
[01:56:10.344 --> 01:56:11.484]  I like to use a knife.
[01:56:13.365 --> 01:56:20.947]  A gun is too violent, too noisy, but just fit my hand well.
[01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:24.147]  And later, he admitted to killing dozens more.
[01:56:24.527 --> 01:56:26.928]  So many, he says he can't even keep track.
[01:56:27.108 --> 01:56:34.750]  I'm not Billy the Kid and making notches on my poster, so I know it's been a lot.
[01:56:35.210 --> 01:56:37.751]  Addicted to killing is the way he characterized it.
[01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:40.132]  I don't have an on and off switch.
[01:56:40.472 --> 01:56:41.952]  I'm just after that drug.
[01:56:42.932 --> 01:56:43.492]  I'm after that.
[01:56:47.822 --> 01:56:50.723]  Nightline interviewed Sells on Death Row in 2010.
[01:56:51.323 --> 01:56:54.584]  One of the rare glimpses into the mind of a serial killer.
[01:56:55.044 --> 01:56:56.265]  It's complicated.
[01:57:01.366 --> 01:57:03.627]  When people enter my life, they get hurt.
[01:57:04.287 --> 01:57:06.968]  Sells is directly linked to over a dozen murders.
[01:57:07.428 --> 01:57:14.450]  The drifter's vagrant lifestyle helped him elude police for nearly 15 years as victims turned up from coast to coast.
[01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:16.851]  When you look at me, you know what hate is.
[01:57:17.901 --> 01:57:19.562]  Because I don't know what love is.
[01:57:20.022 --> 01:57:22.483]  Two words I don't like to use is love and sorry.
[01:57:23.243 --> 01:57:24.903]  Because I'm about hate.
[01:57:25.383 --> 01:57:29.105]  His methods for killing were as random as the people he targeted.
[01:57:29.285 --> 01:57:32.426]  He raped many before cutting their throats or beating them.
[01:57:32.726 --> 01:57:33.446]  Stabbing others.
[01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:34.847]  He strangled some.
[01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:35.887]  A lot of jerking.
[01:57:36.307 --> 01:57:37.327]  A lot of movement.
[01:57:37.867 --> 01:57:38.988]  It's a physical...
[01:57:41.022 --> 01:57:42.244]  You've become part of it.
[01:57:42.604 --> 01:57:46.810]  And described it all with seeming detachment from the horrors he caused.
[01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:48.512]  I don't have no feelings.
[01:57:55.216 --> 01:57:59.139]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:00.620]  I am now completely banned.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:04.643]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.943 --> 01:58:05.984]  I want them shut down.
[01:58:06.024 --> 01:58:06.945]  I want them silenced.
[01:58:06.985 --> 01:58:07.765]  I want them muted.
[01:58:07.825 --> 01:58:09.647]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:58:09.707 --> 01:58:11.228]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:58:11.588 --> 01:58:17.415]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:58:17.515 --> 01:58:24.442]  These are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[01:58:24.522 --> 01:58:28.266]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[01:58:28.567 --> 01:58:31.550]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:32.130]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:45.375]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other InfoWars pages have just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram.
[01:58:45.435 --> 01:58:47.616]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[01:58:48.056 --> 01:58:49.677]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:58:49.717 --> 01:58:52.778]  Facebook, are you going to do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[01:58:53.358 --> 01:58:53.579]  No!
[01:58:53.899 --> 01:58:57.700]  Because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:59.001]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
