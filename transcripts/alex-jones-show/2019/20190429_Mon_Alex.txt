[00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:20.944]  I only decided to go to D.C.
[00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:23.005]  a week ago.
[00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:23.765]  I fly in.
[00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:27.368]  I'd been planning to bullhorn the White House on Wednesday.
[00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:30.309]  But I felt a disturbance in the force.
[00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.390]  And I said, we must go.
[00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:35.172]  For the White House now.
[00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:36.733]  And we've checked the times.
[00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:38.755]  I was there for 45 minutes.
[00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:46.761]  I was bullhorning while Jack Dorsey came in and spoke for the entire meeting with the President.
[00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:48.282]  And the President could hear it.
[00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:52.065]  There's other folks that know how to use bullhorns properly that are out there.
[00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.888]  I ought to give lessons.
[00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:56.109]  I'm not joking.
[00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.470]  And then...
[00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:08.104]  Of course, Fox News covered it, a bunch of others covered the fact that I was pointing out that Jack Dorsey specifically had lied to Congress when he said they don't censor.
[00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:15.986]  They then thought, and the President, I'm told, thought that Jones had inside sources on the meeting that only a few people knew about.
[00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:16.766]  I didn't!
[00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:18.847]  I did not have inside sources.
[00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:25.549]  It just keeps happening, over and over again, that on the same day, at the same time, Trump and I will say the same thing.
[00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:27.054]  That's been noticed.
[00:01:27.074 --> 00:01:27.774]  It's been picked up.
[00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:28.875]  They're bad apples.
[00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.475]  They tried for a coup.
[00:01:31.615 --> 00:01:32.875]  Didn't work out so well.
[00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:46.038]  And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I?
[00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:51.519]  All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.460]  You've been watching.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.260]  You've been seeing.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.902]  You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible in our country.
[00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:04.383]  Corruption at the highest level.
[00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:05.804]  A disgrace.
[00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:07.905]  Spying.
[00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:09.565]  Surveillance.
[00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:13.527]  Trying for an overthrow.
[00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:15.808]  And we caught him.
[00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:17.268]  We caught him.
[00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:18.489]  Trump has caught them.
[00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.730]  More documents came out yesterday of Strzok and Page.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.804]  After Trump was in the White House trying to manipulate their moles inside the White House.
[00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:41.595]  You've now got Samantha Powers and the rest of them coming out and saying, oh, other people might have jumped into our computers and, you know, given the authorization for unmasking via the NSA.
[00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:49.202]  You've got Clapper and Brennan on TV running around saying that, oh, we were under orders of Obama, so we can't go to jail.
[00:02:49.702 --> 00:03:00.431]  I don't think it's surprising at all that we continue to hear these sociopathic ramblings of Mr. Trump claiming that there was this effort to try to prevent him from being elected or to unseat him.
[00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:08.337]  They're saying all of that because they know they've committed major crimes and they know Trump is not business as usual and that they're about to get their asses prosecuted.
[00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:09.438]  This is real.
[00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:11.360]  This is happening.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.221]  This is going down.
[00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:14.042]  This was a coup.
[00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:16.364]  This was an attempted overthrow
[00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:18.777]  Of the United States government.
[00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:24.962]  We had people coming out to vote from all over this country that are in love with what we're doing.
[00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:27.023]  It's called Make America Great Again.
[00:03:27.043 --> 00:03:28.564]  That's what we've done and we're doing.
[00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:32.627]  And this was an overthrow and it's a disgraceful thing.
[00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:35.649]  And I don't I think it's far bigger than Watergate.
[00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.753]  I think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this country.
[00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:42.294]  Maybe beyond political.
[00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:46.777]  So I think that a lot of things are being learned right now just like you just
[00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:51.707]  Mentioned, uh, just a few moments ago again with Strzok and Page.
[00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:52.607]  He's a sick people.
[00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:54.329]  He's a sick, sick people.
[00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.173]  So let's see what happens with McCabe and Comey and Brennan and Clapper.
[00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:00.234]  They weren't in the act.
[00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:08.881]  And let's see what happens and let's see how high it goes up because it's inconceivable when it goes to Clapper, Brennan, Comey, these people.
[00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:14.947]  I would imagine that some other people, maybe a little bit higher up, also knew about it and maybe a lot higher up.
[00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:18.295]  I talked to not one, not two, but three people.
[00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:20.536]  Three people.
[00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:31.339]  Who had talked to the President, two of them in person, last week, when I was in D.C., but they said Trump is going after them.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.540]  And he went on Hannity and said it last night.
[00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.041]  So this is a big deal.
[00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:41.123]  This is a really big deal, and if you're not getting chills,
[00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:42.840]  I'm getting them right now.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.524]  The opportunity to rout the globalists and really get a fresh start is so good for all of our children, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:04:52.507 --> 00:04:56.430]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:04.952 --> 00:05:11.677]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:05:11.697 --> 00:05:14.859]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.320]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.162]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:20.663]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:05:21.183 --> 00:05:27.207]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:05:27.647 --> 00:05:29.589]  So remember, you are the InfoWarrant.
[00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.850]  I'm not the leader.
[00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.750]  You are the leader.
[00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:33.532]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:05:33.932 --> 00:05:38.676]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:05:39.337 --> 00:05:46.823]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:48.124]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:05:48.504 --> 00:05:49.385]  I want to encourage you again.
[00:05:49.885 --> 00:05:54.570]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.593]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[00:05:57.973 --> 00:05:59.855]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:00.856]  God bless you.
[00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:12.078]  Is the U.S.
[00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:21.449]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:06:24.473 --> 00:06:25.174]  To Turkey?
[00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.198]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:30.396]  A new world order.
[00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:34.599]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:41.665]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:50.132]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim al-Hajj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:54.355]  In a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:58.979]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercise.
[00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.564]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:10.529]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.751]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:18.176]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:22.978]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:29.642]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[00:07:29.802 --> 00:07:34.144]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:38.507]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[00:07:38.947 --> 00:07:40.728]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:53.775]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:56.256]  It's known as the Milderberg Group.
[00:07:56.936 --> 00:07:59.137]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:08:13.337 --> 00:08:15.499]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.224]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:29.152]  It's Monday, April 29th, 2019.
[00:08:29.272 --> 00:08:31.194]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.454 --> 00:08:35.798]  We're going to be here for the next four hours in the War Room with Owen Schroyers.
[00:08:36.478 --> 00:08:36.879]  Coming up...
[00:08:38.857 --> 00:08:45.241]  I came in on Saturday, did a special report, covered it as well yesterday on the Sunday regular broadcast at 4-6 p.m.
[00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:52.726]  And out of all the incredible breaking news we've got here in front of me, I really have trouble not just getting my back into this because it's so incredible.
[00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:58.890]  We have millions of people, tens of thousands a day, coming into the United States.
[00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.451]  We have 5,000 getting caught.
[00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:03.513]  We have on average 1,600 being released just
[00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:11.092]  into the general population with no medical testing being done at all for the first time in US history.
[00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:20.622]  It started under Obama about eight years ago, about two years into his administration, and Trump's been able to get Congress to change the law or to get the funding to build the emergency centers.
[00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:22.789]  And so
[00:09:53.656 --> 00:09:56.131]  Yesterday's Sunday show was titled Emergency.
[00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:01.606]  Terrorists hit 21 states with lethal biological weapons.
[00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:12.430]  DHS confirms over 10,000 weaponized human carriers have been purposely let in and that's a conservative estimate of 10,000 disease carriers just in the first few months of this year.
[00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:23.955]  That was the only number I could find by ICE was back in February that they thought already 10,000 diseased had gotten in just from preliminary checks they would do for an hour and then be ordered to release them because they just didn't have places to put them.
[00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:28.600]  So it's probably 20,000, 30,000 now.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.120]  We don't know.
[00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:31.642]  But you have TB, drug resistant.
[00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:34.404]  Your kid gets put in a quarantine for a year.
[00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:37.746]  You get the measles, you get put in quarantine for three weeks.
[00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:40.528]  You get pertussis, you get put in quarantine for a month.
[00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:42.350]  And this is new drug resistant.
[00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:44.793]  Vaccine-resistant pertussis.
[00:10:44.813 --> 00:10:47.254]  This is vaccine-resistant measles.
[00:10:47.794 --> 00:10:49.935]  Because it's new strains, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:53.436]  Most of the time, the measles, mumps, rubella shot, they admit, doesn't protect you.
[00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:57.457]  But it 100% doesn't protect you from new, third-world strains.
[00:10:57.497 --> 00:11:09.421]  And yesterday, I spent the entire two hours of the Sunday show showing CDC documents, mainstream news, ABC news, Fox News, local health departments, but it was all regional news.
[00:11:10.948 --> 00:11:15.009]  Only ABC nationally interviewed a bunch of experts saying this is illegal aliens doing this.
[00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:16.989]  They called them migrants, not invaders.
[00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.610]  So think about that.
[00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.271]  You've got the images last year and this year of the Guatemala border being crushed into Mexico.
[00:11:23.691 --> 00:11:28.112]  Tens of thousands pouring across at one time, using children as human shields.
[00:11:28.132 --> 00:11:31.253]  They now admit they just dump out on the side of the road when they're done with them.
[00:11:31.453 --> 00:11:32.333]  That's all over the news.
[00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:35.414]  This is so incredibly cold-blooded.
[00:11:38.032 --> 00:11:42.996]  This is so incredibly cold-blooded, and we're being hit by massive open borders.
[00:11:44.277 --> 00:11:46.119]  We're being hit by total criminality.
[00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:50.863]  90-plus percent military-age men coming in out of Latin America.
[00:11:51.443 --> 00:11:52.264]  In Europe, it was only 80 percent.
[00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.591]  Raping, robbing, killing, doing whatever they want.
[00:11:57.391 --> 00:12:00.833]  And I played the clip Saturday, I played it Sunday, maybe I'll play them again today.
[00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:13.977]  Fox News local, ABC News local, from California, and New York, and Michigan, and Texas, and local health department officials, and border patrol talking local news, saying we're ordered to release them, they've got diseases.
[00:12:14.477 --> 00:12:19.139]  We've released people with 105 fevers and bumps all over their bodies.
[00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:21.260]  It's obviously smallpox.
[00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:24.370]  That's right, smallpox is coming in.
[00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.971]  Wait till smallpox starts spreading.
[00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.132]  That really can kill you.
[00:12:28.972 --> 00:12:33.535]  Measles, you know, maybe about a 1 out of 5,000 die that get it, run down immune systems.
[00:12:34.055 --> 00:12:38.397]  Now smallpox, it gets you a nice 20% dead or so, even in modern times.
[00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:39.718]  How about a little bit of that, hmm?
[00:12:40.278 --> 00:12:41.679]  How about some black plague?
[00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:43.339]  Some ebonic plague.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.422]  How about stuff there's no cure for, like transferable or wet leprosy.
[00:12:49.462 --> 00:12:50.243]  It's called wet
[00:12:51.644 --> 00:12:53.867]  Leprosy, because you tend to drip when you got it.
[00:12:54.127 --> 00:12:57.532]  The dry one just peels off your skin, and you can't really spread it.
[00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:03.981]  Nobody really knows even how you get it, but the wet... Ooh, the wet feels so good!
[00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:12.657]  And then you wipe your butt or whatever when you're in that leper colony and you get leprosy on your ass, or you touch a little kid and they get it and their nose falls off in a year.
[00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:14.018]  Nothing funner!
[00:13:14.618 --> 00:13:19.082]  And by the way, they're having to set up leper colonies again in Florida and Texas in areas.
[00:13:19.122 --> 00:13:19.602]  Look it up!
[00:13:19.943 --> 00:13:22.665]  There's big ol' juicy leper colonies now!
[00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:25.006]  Big ol' juicy ones!
[00:13:25.747 --> 00:13:28.769]  Where the folks come in with the leprosy and then they go live in their leper colonies.
[00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.050]  Isn't that nice?
[00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.052]  Because your taxpayers pay for it.
[00:13:32.332 --> 00:13:33.153]  Just like we'll pay
[00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:36.950]  For having your genitals cut off.
[00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:39.411]  That's right.
[00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:44.253]  If you want to have a taxpayer paid for your genitals cut off, we'll do that too.
[00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:46.974]  But the good part about leprosy is you don't have to pay.
[00:13:47.912 --> 00:13:51.636]  You get it on the old ding-a-ling, it's bye-bye.
[00:13:52.156 --> 00:13:59.443]  So I just want everybody to be able to think about all these goodies that are coming in, and how stupid the system thinks we are.
[00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:02.666]  That is, all this pours into the nation.
[00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:08.312]  They then tell us that it's those of us that haven't had shots in a decade, or those of us that haven't had the vaccines.
[00:14:09.835 --> 00:14:10.836]  That it's all our fault.
[00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:18.046]  We're going to break it back down when we come back with AOC and others saying, I don't think you should have any borders.
[00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:25.596]  And Beto saying, and everybody else, and French Imam tells Muslims to not donate money to rebuilding Notre Dame.
[00:14:25.716 --> 00:14:26.697]  Piss on Notre Dame.
[00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:30.140]  That's all coming up here today.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:36.644]  The latest attacks on Trump and his Trump selling out to Big Pharma on his going sideways now and flip flopping on vaccines.
[00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.286]  It's all coming up today.
[00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:56.978]  Let me just tell listeners that it's the last day and this will be the last day to get a free bottle of our amazing Sleep Aid knockout that has thousands and thousands of five star reviews with eight different mother nature derived synergistic systems to give you the deepest, best, healthy sleep.
[00:14:57.598 --> 00:15:02.264]  Sure, there's sleeping pills and stuff you can take that knock you out, but they're not giving you the REM sleep and what you need.
[00:15:02.304 --> 00:15:03.886]  This is the real healthy knockout.
[00:15:04.306 --> 00:15:09.532]  The Ultryptophan, the Valerian, the Melatonin, the Lemon Balm, the Chamomile, and so much more.
[00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:17.181]  Free bottle of it, a $19.95 value, when you get a bottle of Brain Force Plus, the great
[00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:23.666]  Awakening Focus, a mental clarity product, incredibly popular, super strong.
[00:15:23.686 --> 00:15:24.806]  It says take two pills.
[00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:26.307]  I would only take one the first time you take it.
[00:15:26.847 --> 00:15:35.813]  You get that at 25% off and a free bottle of Knockout because Knockout is so amazing and it is our overall, we sell the most bottles of it.
[00:15:36.173 --> 00:15:37.614]  And I did order a giant amount of them.
[00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:43.918]  So we've got a glut of those, but that has to end today because we're selling out very soon of Brain Force Plus.
[00:15:44.838 --> 00:15:47.281]  So, InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:15:47.621 --> 00:15:50.004]  InfoWarsLife.com gets you right to the combo.
[00:15:50.084 --> 00:15:55.090]  Last day to get that, then we have a new super sale that launched today that I'll tell you about a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.916]  But you get a free bottle of X3 right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.918]  The globalists are hammering humanity with bad halogens.
[00:16:06.358 --> 00:16:07.679]  Fluoride being chief amongst them.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.084]  While they try to keep the one good halogen out of the food supply, and that's iodine.
[00:16:13.304 --> 00:16:15.906]  But most iodine isn't pure, so you can't absorb it.
[00:16:16.106 --> 00:16:16.586]  Well, guess what?
[00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.848]  X2's back in stock, and it's discounted.
[00:16:18.868 --> 00:16:23.672]  And when you get a bottle of the original X2, you get a free bottle of X3 to see how amazing it is.
[00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:26.294]  Only at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:26.714 --> 00:16:27.675]  Now, stay with us.
[00:16:27.795 --> 00:16:29.617]  I'll break down the latest developments.
[00:16:42.487 --> 00:16:43.749]  There is a war.
[00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.250]  It's happening now.
[00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.873]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:16:48.414 --> 00:16:50.256]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:16:51.017 --> 00:16:52.538]  We are the resistance.
[00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:54.661]  We are the Infowar.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.547]  There are a lot of people out there that say they're on the front lines of the fight for liberty.
[00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:06.810]  And some are.
[00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:10.021]  But I'm not doing this to be famous.
[00:17:10.081 --> 00:17:11.722]  I'm doing this because it was the right thing to do.
[00:17:11.782 --> 00:17:14.284]  And let me tell you, I've gotten deep into this fight.
[00:17:15.045 --> 00:17:18.488]  And I've got the globalists pulling out every stop and every dirty trick you can imagine.
[00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:31.339]  But because you've stood with Infowars, because you've spread the word, and because you've bought the products we sell, the funder operations, we are here in the face of the globalist tyranny being more aggressive and more effective than ever.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.101]  I just went to D.C.
[00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:38.226]  and bullhorned the president while Jack Dorsey was inside, lying, saying they don't censor conservatives.
[00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:42.209]  Ilhan Omar is calling for Trump to be banned, for God's sakes.
[00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.811]  And we were in D.C.
[00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:51.818]  doing dozens of major interviews and really affecting change and getting the president to go after the deep state with criminal charges, which you heard about years ago.
[00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:54.140]  And now the president's finally getting ready to do it.
[00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:56.323]  We are the real change agents.
[00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:58.606]  We are effective because we tell the truth.
[00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:02.431]  But without you backing us, we won't be here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:02.972 --> 00:18:06.476]  Without you supporting us, the globalists will be able to shut us down.
[00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:13.016]  Please understand that my philosophy is to give you the very best information out there.
[00:18:13.736 --> 00:18:17.178]  And my philosophy with products we sell to fund ourselves is very simple.
[00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:26.803]  Sell the highest quality that I, myself, and my family take, give it to you at a great price so that it's a win-win, so you continue to want to come back and get it over and over again.
[00:18:27.404 --> 00:18:30.906]  We're running two new specials for one week and one week only.
[00:18:31.886 --> 00:18:32.987]  The biggest one ever is
[00:18:34.421 --> 00:18:36.122]  X2, we were able to get back in stock.
[00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.743]  Deep Earth, pure iodine crystals.
[00:18:38.563 --> 00:18:41.824]  Read about iodine deficiency, how it has lower IQs, you don't have it.
[00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:44.766]  Boosted IQs, how it's the building block of the whole body.
[00:18:45.286 --> 00:18:47.007]  Just as essential as water or oxygen.
[00:18:47.307 --> 00:18:49.768]  We have the true pure iodine that you can absorb.
[00:18:49.788 --> 00:18:51.849]  About 98% of people can.
[00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.071]  And it's just a game changer.
[00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:56.351]  We have it back in stock.
[00:18:56.391 --> 00:18:58.992]  And when you get one bottle of X2, already 25% off.
[00:18:59.693 --> 00:19:00.553]  Already a great deal.
[00:19:03.502 --> 00:19:06.945]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[00:19:07.526 --> 00:19:08.346]  Absolutely free.
[00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:12.850]  Now, we sat out with top scientists and said, could we make X2 better?
[00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:14.232]  This has the deep-earth crystals in it.
[00:19:14.312 --> 00:19:14.752]  X3 does.
[00:19:15.032 --> 00:19:15.873]  And they said, yes.
[00:19:16.554 --> 00:19:22.899]  You'd have the other two types of iodine in there because a low percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.041]  Just like most people can't absorb
[00:19:26.002 --> 00:19:27.783]  Iodine that isn't atomic.
[00:19:28.243 --> 00:19:29.284]  So again, it's a catch-22.
[00:19:30.004 --> 00:19:31.785]  So we created X3.
[00:19:32.246 --> 00:19:35.248]  Now X3 is weaker on purpose.
[00:19:35.628 --> 00:19:38.489]  Because again, some people can't handle the strongest iodine.
[00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.312]  Consult your physician before you take it, because this is real stuff.
[00:19:43.152 --> 00:19:48.796]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, get a bottle of X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:49.297 --> 00:19:56.722]  Incredibly popular, thousands of five-star reviews, and get a free bottle of X3 so you can experience how amazing it is as well.
[00:19:57.162 --> 00:20:00.445]  InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:02.026]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:08.571]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.456 --> 00:20:30.918]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:20:31.338 --> 00:20:36.720]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.481]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:44.741]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:46.822]  A new world order.
[00:20:50.493 --> 00:20:53.615]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:55.055]  It just pancakes.
[00:20:57.417 --> 00:21:01.219]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:19.153]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:21:19.173 --> 00:21:27.836]  Guns will be taken, and no one will be able to be allowed to take all of them.
[00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:32.978]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.538]  Global governance at last.
[00:21:34.618 --> 00:21:35.579]  Is it one world?
[00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:37.239]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:40.741]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:21:40.821 --> 00:21:41.261]  And for me!
[00:21:42.965 --> 00:21:56.973]  I intend to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today on all these big issues and topics.
[00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:19.326]  And if you just tuned in, you know I started the broadcast out really outraged that we have millions of people pouring into the country illegally a year.
[00:22:20.026 --> 00:22:21.488]  They're not even doing any vetting.
[00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:26.952]  The Border Patrol is not even allowed to because the beds are overwhelmed, the courts are overwhelmed.
[00:22:27.573 --> 00:22:37.161]  The plan by Obama and the deep state to swamp the country and try to bring down the Trump presidency with massive hordes under a UN plan is already 70% complete.
[00:22:38.763 --> 00:23:01.107]  And if the President doesn't declare a real national emergency as Commander-in-Chief, and put the regular Army and Marines on the border, and actually deport these people by force, overriding the courts, which he can do in a constitutional crisis, as Commander-in-Chief, like Eisenhower did, we will be totally swamped, all the illegals will be given voter cards, and the Democrats will have checkmate.
[00:23:02.368 --> 00:23:08.349]  That's why AOC and others are saying we shouldn't have any borders at all.
[00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:11.648]  Think of the outrageousness of this.
[00:23:12.288 --> 00:23:13.769]  You know, she has walls on her home.
[00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:14.570]  She has doors.
[00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.550]  She has a bank account.
[00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.951]  She has her own private PIN number.
[00:23:18.632 --> 00:23:19.332]  She has walls.
[00:23:21.253 --> 00:23:21.833]  She has skin.
[00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:24.335]  She has shell membranes.
[00:23:25.075 --> 00:23:26.035]  Mexico has a border.
[00:23:26.056 --> 00:23:29.357]  You fly into Mexico, they want to know where you're staying, what you're doing.
[00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:31.558]  You try to stay a few days extra, they fine you.
[00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:33.980]  But not here!
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.021]  We've got another arrogant America-hater
[00:23:36.872 --> 00:23:41.295]  There's been caught in more incredible lies that are up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com we're going to be covering.
[00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:55.603]  Where she went on CNN and MSNBC and said that Trump and Conway lied about her and that she took off a week to visit Puerto Rico to visit her grandfather that Trump reportedly ruined.
[00:23:55.783 --> 00:23:56.403]  That's a big lie.
[00:23:56.944 --> 00:23:58.144]  No Democrats like you ruined it.
[00:23:58.685 --> 00:23:59.585]  Always stealing all the money.
[00:24:00.466 --> 00:24:04.268]  And that she didn't tweet about all the church bombings.
[00:24:05.578 --> 00:24:15.724]  When she tweeted immediately dozens of times about the synagogue, I mean about the mosque shooting in Christchurch over in New Zealand.
[00:24:16.084 --> 00:24:17.785]  And it turns out she was tweeting the whole time!
[00:24:19.566 --> 00:24:20.126]  She's a liar!
[00:24:21.347 --> 00:24:22.348]  But that's all she does.
[00:24:22.408 --> 00:24:25.589]  She lies when she sent out hundreds of tweets during that week.
[00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.431]  And there's evidence of it.
[00:24:28.471 --> 00:24:31.713]  She tells the news, I sent no tweets out that week.
[00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:34.808]  She just insults your intelligence.
[00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:37.189]  That's what these people do.
[00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:49.737]  The United States sent more aid to Puerto Rico than we've ever sent to any of our, quote, protectorates or possessions before.
[00:24:50.537 --> 00:24:52.698]  It's not a state, it's a protectorate or a possession.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.460]  Think about that.
[00:24:56.638 --> 00:24:59.881]  We sent billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[00:25:00.281 --> 00:25:01.923]  Billions in aid was sent by private groups.
[00:25:02.283 --> 00:25:08.149]  And I talked to security forces and people that were there, hired Blackwater types, and they said it was incredible corruption.
[00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:11.592]  The Democrats that run the island just stole the money.
[00:25:12.953 --> 00:25:15.316]  But that's okay because they said it's all Trump's fault.
[00:25:16.517 --> 00:25:21.582]  And anywhere Democrats run a city or an island or a town or a county or a state,
[00:25:22.861 --> 00:25:24.362]  The roads have giant potholes.
[00:25:24.442 --> 00:25:25.863]  There's human feces everywhere.
[00:25:26.283 --> 00:25:27.544]  There's drug needles everywhere.
[00:25:27.924 --> 00:25:28.985]  That's the culture.
[00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:30.105]  That's the society.
[00:25:30.566 --> 00:25:33.948]  That's the atmosphere that they create.
[00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.712]  That's the system that they establish.
[00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:42.413]  That's the system that they deploy.
[00:25:44.214 --> 00:25:45.435]  That's what they are.
[00:25:46.696 --> 00:25:47.616]  It's what they do.
[00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:48.537]  They steal.
[00:25:49.488 --> 00:25:56.473]  And they create racial and cultural and religious divisions to get us all infighting with each other as a rearguard action while they run off with the cash.
[00:25:57.794 --> 00:25:58.795]  You ever heard of bank robbers?
[00:25:59.055 --> 00:26:00.616]  Or stagecoach riders in the old days?
[00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:01.516]  Or train robbers?
[00:26:01.817 --> 00:26:12.764]  They'd set a big fire in town, right outside town, at a church or something, knowing the whole town would get together with buckets of water, right as a train came in so they could rob it.
[00:26:13.485 --> 00:26:16.207]  So sheriffs and others began to learn, wait a minute,
[00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:24.946]  Every time there's a fire that's suspicious, we've got to watch the bank, or the train station, or the stagecoach station.
[00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:27.488]  Wait a minute, there's a fire at the church?
[00:26:27.849 --> 00:26:29.290]  Didn't payroll just come in last night?
[00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.931]  It's about to be here?
[00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:31.912]  Get to the payroll station!
[00:26:31.932 --> 00:26:32.473]  Get to the bank!
[00:26:32.713 --> 00:26:34.415]  And you show up, and then the robbers are in there.
[00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:41.689]  This is what the Democrats do, ladies and gentlemen, and it's all in the WikiLeaks, which is why they're so pissed.
[00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:46.991]  They're in the WikiLeaks telling Hillary, top professors, we've got to create racial division.
[00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:53.214]  It hasn't worked so far, but we believe if we create maximum race war, we'll be able to defeat Trump.
[00:26:55.435 --> 00:26:56.555]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:26:56.575 --> 00:27:00.857]  So when we come back, I'm going to get to AOC and Beto and all the latest clips.
[00:27:02.472 --> 00:27:04.013]  Of them not saying the world's gonna end.
[00:27:04.113 --> 00:27:04.554]  No, no, no, no.
[00:27:04.894 --> 00:27:06.155]  Those were the clips a few weeks ago.
[00:27:06.675 --> 00:27:08.157]  Do what we say or the world's gonna end.
[00:27:08.497 --> 00:27:09.518]  As cult leaders always say.
[00:27:10.358 --> 00:27:10.518]  No.
[00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:13.381]  Saying that we don't need any borders at all.
[00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:16.063]  And borders are basically Nazi.
[00:27:17.628 --> 00:27:23.211]  And just think about the type of middle midget morons that the establishment has picked to go out and spew this garbage.
[00:27:23.231 --> 00:27:31.876]  But think about the fact that we're having so much trouble even defeating them when their crimes are so naked and so brazen and so out in the open.
[00:27:32.196 --> 00:27:33.397]  Yeah, Beto likens U.S.
[00:27:33.437 --> 00:27:35.298]  immigration laws to slavery.
[00:27:36.739 --> 00:27:37.179]  That's right.
[00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:44.804]  If you don't let in unwashed third world masses and give them everything free and a voter registration card and a driver's license, you're making slaves.
[00:27:45.933 --> 00:27:47.174]  They're speaking to young people.
[00:27:47.194 --> 00:27:52.296]  They're speaking to folks that haven't lived yet, who are entitled, saying, you deserve free education.
[00:27:53.276 --> 00:27:59.039]  You deserve free money, a free, quote, living wage, even if you don't, quote, want to work, in the words of AOC, in her Green Deal.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.060]  Free education.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.601]  Free housing.
[00:28:03.741 --> 00:28:04.562]  A free living.
[00:28:05.602 --> 00:28:06.342]  Free health care.
[00:28:06.683 --> 00:28:09.104]  And if you're black, why reparations?
[00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:12.963]  Think about how sick... That's slavery.
[00:28:13.924 --> 00:28:18.468]  98% of people, look up the statistics in this country, have no relations to anybody that ever owned a slave.
[00:28:19.008 --> 00:28:20.690]  Most people came here after slavery who were white.
[00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:22.391]  No connection.
[00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:23.412]  There wasn't any slavery in Europe.
[00:28:24.554 --> 00:28:26.875]  Since the time of the Romans, white on white slavery.
[00:28:26.895 --> 00:28:30.417]  But if you're Italian, are you going to have to pay reparations?
[00:28:31.018 --> 00:28:35.240]  Because your ancestors 2,000 years ago had German or French slaves, Gaulish slaves.
[00:28:35.541 --> 00:28:37.161]  Think about the slavery of that.
[00:28:37.902 --> 00:28:40.644]  To say because you're white, you owe a black person money.
[00:28:40.864 --> 00:28:42.104]  As if they even want that money.
[00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:44.826]  Think of the insult the Democrats put out to black people.
[00:28:45.026 --> 00:28:45.727]  Hey, you're black.
[00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:47.127]  You deserve some reparations.
[00:28:47.147 --> 00:28:47.227]  What?
[00:28:48.448 --> 00:28:51.991]  And you know those reparations are going to come with the strings that you're going to be their slaves.
[00:28:52.352 --> 00:28:54.133]  So the people paying the reparations are slaves.
[00:28:54.353 --> 00:28:56.175]  The people getting the reparations are going to be slaves.
[00:28:56.535 --> 00:28:57.176]  Look at welfare.
[00:28:57.216 --> 00:28:58.257]  Look at breaking up the family.
[00:28:58.517 --> 00:28:59.638]  It's all a plan!
[00:29:00.258 --> 00:29:01.299]  It's all a plan!
[00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:11.788]  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight against the globalists has been like a 12-round boxing match that's got more like 100 rounds.
[00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:15.552]  And I'd say we're in about the 85th round right now.
[00:29:16.604 --> 00:29:20.167]  Now, just today, I'm shooting this report on Friday afternoon.
[00:29:21.027 --> 00:29:30.314]  We've had really serious sabotage and attacks behind the scenes, and I've decided not to give the specifics of it for reasons that I can't disclose at this time.
[00:29:30.395 --> 00:29:39.241]  But the fact that President Trump's getting the country back, the fact that nationalists are getting elected all over the world, the fact that we're now aware of the threat of radical Islam,
[00:29:40.282 --> 00:29:48.244]  The fact that all of this is going on is really making the establishment very, very angry.
[00:29:48.924 --> 00:29:59.186]  It just came out today that Ilhan Omar, the authoritarian Somali that admits she hates America, called up and threatened Jack Dorsey and said, how dare you keep Trump on Twitter?
[00:29:59.606 --> 00:30:03.947]  He criticized me and showed my clips basically praising radical Islam.
[00:30:04.787 --> 00:30:07.028]  And Dorsey explained to her, well, we have free speech in this country.
[00:30:07.762 --> 00:30:21.221]  Well, the truth is, behind the scenes, if you're not President Trump, these types of phone calls and open calls for us to be censored in Congress have had the desired effect of them trying to curtail us and cut us down to nothing.
[00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:24.565]  They're even going after our basic operations center.
[00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:28.786]  They're going after our actual servers, our infrastructure.
[00:30:28.886 --> 00:30:30.648]  But we have redundancy built in.
[00:30:31.189 --> 00:30:36.536]  But that costs a lot of money to have people working overtime to keep our systems in place.
[00:30:37.337 --> 00:30:41.702]  So, in the final equation, if you want to see the globalists defeated,
[00:30:42.483 --> 00:30:51.291]  And if you want to see the deep state prosecuted that we're inches away from, if you want to see the tide totally turned, it takes money to prosecute an information war.
[00:30:51.651 --> 00:30:53.393]  We have truth, they have lies.
[00:30:53.993 --> 00:30:57.877]  The truth is more powerful than lies, but they have globalist dirty money.
[00:30:58.337 --> 00:30:59.638]  Fiat, Federal Reserve money.
[00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:00.539]  Show.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.542]  I'm launching this weekend for one week.
[00:31:04.682 --> 00:31:05.223]  New sales.
[00:31:05.303 --> 00:31:07.406]  We're having to end the t-shirt sale 50% off.
[00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:11.711]  We're having to end the sale on a free bottle of Knockout with Brain Force Plus.
[00:31:11.751 --> 00:31:12.773]  That ends in just a couple days.
[00:31:14.255 --> 00:31:17.379]  But we're launching two new super specials right now.
[00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:18.720]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:31:19.642 --> 00:31:36.511]  Which is the ultimate bone broth, strongest bone broth formula with chaga mushroom, with concentrated turmeric, with all sorts of other key ingredients known to fight inflammation, known to be antioxidants, known to be good for your joints, your bones, your eyes, everything.
[00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:39.653]  And then organic concentrated chicken broth.
[00:31:39.693 --> 00:31:44.475]  Everybody knows that, you know, when you got the flu or whatever, that chicken broth for whatever reason has that essence that's good.
[00:31:44.775 --> 00:31:45.116]  This is
[00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:50.921]  Like dozens and dozens of bowls of chicken broth, each serving without all the calories.
[00:31:51.562 --> 00:31:52.964]  Bone broth is amazing.
[00:31:53.184 --> 00:31:55.346]  Everybody knows its attributes for thousands of years.
[00:31:55.686 --> 00:31:56.748]  It's the hottest item out there.
[00:31:57.751 --> 00:32:05.236]  We went out a few years ago and looked at all the top-selling, best-rated brands and said, let's make it even stronger and even better for a low price.
[00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:08.539]  Because most places mark them up five, six, seven times.
[00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:09.560]  We mark it up 150%.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.122]  When we have a discount, we only mark it up 100%.
[00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:18.706]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is only marked up about 65% right now.
[00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:23.490]  You can get ultimate bone broth formula, which is low in stock.
[00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.171]  For only $19.95 at Infowarstore.com.
[00:32:28.692 --> 00:32:30.012]  Experience it for yourself.
[00:32:30.112 --> 00:32:30.852]  It tastes okay.
[00:32:31.172 --> 00:32:36.514]  But if you mix it in with whey, if you mix it in with some fruit, if you mix it in with some milk and things, it tastes great.
[00:32:37.014 --> 00:32:37.695]  Drink it down.
[00:32:37.915 --> 00:32:39.875]  Great post-workout.
[00:32:40.515 --> 00:32:41.656]  Great meal replacement.
[00:32:42.036 --> 00:32:42.836]  This is really it.
[00:32:43.236 --> 00:32:44.777]  Ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:32:45.717 --> 00:32:49.859]  50% off the already discounted price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:59.923]  We've got another special there as well that I don't have time to tell you about, but while you're on the site, look for the Buy Survival Shield X2 and get X3 absolutely free.
[00:33:00.203 --> 00:33:01.183]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:06.865 --> 00:33:09.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.103 --> 00:33:19.224]  It's never going to get any better.
[00:33:19.624 --> 00:33:20.344]  Don't look for it.
[00:33:20.764 --> 00:33:21.885]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:33:23.045 --> 00:33:26.127]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:33:26.647 --> 00:33:28.308]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:29.749]  The real owners.
[00:33:29.829 --> 00:33:34.351]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:35.972]  Forget the politicians.
[00:33:36.192 --> 00:33:39.474]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:33:41.034 --> 00:33:41.515]  You don't.
[00:33:42.255 --> 00:33:43.235]  You have no choice.
[00:33:43.616 --> 00:33:44.556]  You have owners.
[00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:45.777]  They own you.
[00:33:47.113 --> 00:33:48.414]  They own everything.
[00:33:48.655 --> 00:33:50.276]  They own all the important land.
[00:33:50.656 --> 00:33:52.398]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:33:52.418 --> 00:33:55.901]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[00:33:55.921 --> 00:33:57.503]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:33:57.823 --> 00:34:02.648]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:34:02.828 --> 00:34:04.450]  They got you by the balls!
[00:34:05.945 --> 00:34:08.026]  They want obedient workers.
[00:34:08.506 --> 00:34:09.987]  Obedient workers.
[00:34:10.307 --> 00:34:22.992]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:34:23.072 --> 00:34:26.314]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[00:34:26.794 --> 00:34:29.435]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:34:30.855 --> 00:34:31.796]  It's a big club.
[00:34:32.765 --> 00:34:33.565]  And you ain't in it.
[00:34:34.166 --> 00:34:36.867]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:34:37.248 --> 00:34:39.189]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:43.551]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:34:44.972 --> 00:34:46.493]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:50.315]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:54.257]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:34:54.277 --> 00:34:55.238]  They're not interested in that.
[00:34:55.518 --> 00:34:56.458]  That doesn't help them.
[00:34:56.839 --> 00:34:58.219]  That's against their interest.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.100]  That's right.
[00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:09.828]  Big Brother.
[00:35:10.288 --> 00:35:11.529]  Mainstream media.
[00:35:12.089 --> 00:35:13.951]  Government cover-ups.
[00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:15.412]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:35:15.652 --> 00:35:16.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:17.334 --> 00:35:29.984]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:35:30.064 --> 00:35:37.771]  So, if you just joined us, you saw that powerful piece from The Grave, George Carlin.
[00:35:39.238 --> 00:35:40.418]  But that was before Trump.
[00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:41.679]  That was before Infowars.
[00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:42.919]  I can tell you I'm for real.
[00:35:42.999 --> 00:35:44.480]  I can tell you you're for real.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.562]  And I know Trump is hitting on about seven out of eight cylinders.
[00:35:49.322 --> 00:35:50.602]  The Clintons were hitting on zero.
[00:35:51.543 --> 00:35:52.763]  George W. on about three.
[00:35:53.744 --> 00:35:56.045]  Trump is trying to pragmatically bring the country back.
[00:35:56.085 --> 00:35:57.505]  He's trying to turn the economy on.
[00:35:58.105 --> 00:35:59.626]  And he's trying to do it from the swamp.
[00:36:00.845 --> 00:36:03.207]  And that's why you see them coming after him so hardcore.
[00:36:03.247 --> 00:36:13.876]  But later in the next segment, I'm going to go over some of the clips of him coming out and saying, take the measles shot over the weekend versus him a few years ago saying how dangerous vaccines are.
[00:36:14.316 --> 00:36:15.778]  So is he selling out to Big Pharma?
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.062]  That's a question David Knight was asking this morning during the show.
[00:36:21.222 --> 00:36:21.863]  Did a great job.
[00:36:22.143 --> 00:36:23.044]  David Knight, 8 a.m.
[00:36:23.524 --> 00:36:24.045]  to 11 a.m.
[00:36:24.065 --> 00:36:24.365]  Central.
[00:36:26.086 --> 00:36:26.907]  They had to get their shots.
[00:36:26.927 --> 00:36:27.928]  Well, Mr. President, how many?
[00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.173]  It's like 60-something they mandate now and try to act like it's the law.
[00:36:32.193 --> 00:36:33.816]  It's going to be 100 soon.
[00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:35.298]  They got hundreds of shots.
[00:36:35.338 --> 00:36:37.762]  Big Pharma wants to get government to just mandate it.
[00:36:37.802 --> 00:36:41.868]  They lobby and then some corporate company makes me pay to have something put in my body.
[00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:50.177]  So the left can kill babies after they're born and say it's a woman's body, even though it's got another brain, another heart.
[00:36:50.677 --> 00:36:53.358]  By the way, I didn't cover this last week, and I want to do it.
[00:36:53.438 --> 00:36:57.338]  Will you guys print me the article from Infowars.com from Adon Salazar Friday?
[00:36:57.358 --> 00:36:58.719]  I forgot to cover it.
[00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:06.120]  Major university textbooks are teaching that babies are parasites, like cancer, and need to be cut out of their mothers.
[00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:12.902]  And the left always said that, but it's got all the graphs and videos and shows it like a cancer.
[00:37:13.382 --> 00:37:14.122]  I want to cover that too.
[00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:16.372]  That's where the problem is.
[00:37:16.432 --> 00:37:17.893]  It's total information overload here.
[00:37:18.293 --> 00:37:21.455]  But let's get into AOC right now.
[00:37:23.195 --> 00:37:28.558]  No, not her brazenly lying again after being challenged on ignoring Sri Lanka massacre.
[00:37:29.458 --> 00:37:31.139]  She just lied and said, you know what?
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.641]  I just wasn't online for that week.
[00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:37.562]  I didn't send any tweets out.
[00:37:37.602 --> 00:37:39.923]  She sent over a hundred out.
[00:37:42.064 --> 00:37:43.825]  She was being challenged for not caring about
[00:37:45.322 --> 00:37:51.527]  The church is being blown up and sending out dozens and dozens of tweets blaming Christians and white people for what happened at Christchurch in New Zealand.
[00:37:52.908 --> 00:37:57.171]  But when a bunch of churches get blown up killing over 290 people, she didn't say a word.
[00:37:57.211 --> 00:37:59.553]  Well, she just said it was a lie that she was busy.
[00:38:01.174 --> 00:38:04.456]  It turns out she'd been there.
[00:38:04.957 --> 00:38:08.339]  She'd been sending text out.
[00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.721]  She was just putting out a bunch of bull.
[00:38:11.301 --> 00:38:13.083]  There's another article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:26.143]  We're good old AOC, God love her, is saying that illegal aliens have a right to do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:38:26.163 --> 00:38:26.803]  Here's the headline.
[00:38:27.244 --> 00:38:32.008]  AOC, well hell, just hear it from her for yourself.
[00:38:32.048 --> 00:38:32.328]  Here it is.
[00:38:35.316 --> 00:38:39.018]  This is the current status of our legal, documented path.
[00:38:39.738 --> 00:38:42.079]  It is completely unjust.
[00:38:42.519 --> 00:39:01.669]  And so the whole legal system right now and the way that the President is choosing to administer and grind all of the agencies to a halt that process legal forms of immigration is forcing people into the shadows and he is creating undocumented populations in the United States.
[00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:04.770]  And then they are being targeted and their rights are being violated.
[00:39:07.652 --> 00:39:11.014]  Folks, first they said there was no border crisis, now they say Trump created it.
[00:39:12.255 --> 00:39:15.296]  The UN plan was to overwhelm the courts and the systems.
[00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:19.419]  And Trump tried to get that fixed in legislation the last few years.
[00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:21.660]  So she's, again, completely lying.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.742]  But here's the finale of what she had to say.
[00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.303]  That's what's actually going on.
[00:39:26.803 --> 00:39:31.086]  And so, especially in this moment, first of all, I believe in human rights.
[00:39:31.866 --> 00:39:32.407]  I don't care
[00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:34.559]  No borders.
[00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:36.020]  No walls.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.460]  I don't care.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.881]  No USA.
[00:39:38.941 --> 00:39:40.461]  I don't care if you're documented.
[00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:40.661]  At all.
[00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:42.062]  I don't care if you're undocumented.
[00:39:42.242 --> 00:39:42.502]  Pause.
[00:39:42.562 --> 00:39:43.382]  I don't care if you're out.
[00:39:43.822 --> 00:39:45.683]  Back this up 15 seconds, because I was interrupting it.
[00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.524]  Maybe we should pull up all the chants at the universities.
[00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:49.644]  No borders!
[00:39:49.784 --> 00:39:50.444]  No walls!
[00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:52.125]  No USA at all!
[00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:53.165]  No borders!
[00:39:53.385 --> 00:39:54.005]  No walls!
[00:39:54.265 --> 00:39:55.686]  No USA at all!
[00:39:56.566 --> 00:39:58.767]  And then now, the Democratic Party, Ilhan Omar.
[00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:05.256]  The other Muslim woman who just got into Congress says she's afraid of America.
[00:40:06.697 --> 00:40:10.719]  There's all these articles about how the Muslims are victims now after all these churches got blown up.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.260]  Poor little babies.
[00:40:13.901 --> 00:40:17.364]  That whole stack of news with her beheading people because
[00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:23.354]  They said the wrong thing online or because they were, quote, gay or... Well, I'll show you some of the articles coming up.
[00:40:23.394 --> 00:40:28.476]  I mean, it's just fantastical that the left defends all of this, but... I'm sorry, here she is.
[00:40:28.837 --> 00:40:32.879]  Here's AOC's no borders, no walls, no USA at all moment.
[00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:34.099]  Moment.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.241]  First of all, I believe in human rights.
[00:40:36.981 --> 00:40:42.584]  I don't care... I don't care...
[00:40:43.948 --> 00:40:45.569]  I don't care if you're documented.
[00:40:45.949 --> 00:40:47.330]  I don't care if you're undocumented.
[00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:48.810]  I don't care if you're out here.
[00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.751]  I don't care if you're in Rikers.
[00:40:51.232 --> 00:40:53.853]  I believe in your fundamental human rights.
[00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:56.014]  Fundamental human rights.
[00:40:56.714 --> 00:41:00.836]  So that's standard UN propaganda that any border at all is evil.
[00:41:00.936 --> 00:41:02.177]  Everyone has a right to go everywhere.
[00:41:02.577 --> 00:41:06.659]  But the globalists live behind huge armored walls and you of course can't see what they're doing.
[00:41:07.546 --> 00:41:08.407]  This is incredible.
[00:41:09.328 --> 00:41:13.411]  Oh, that if Michael Savage wants to fly to England, or thousands of other conservatives, they're banned.
[00:41:13.812 --> 00:41:17.995]  Or thousands of other conservatives can't fly to Australia now, because they've been seen as bad people.
[00:41:19.516 --> 00:41:24.421]  Or if you are Australian, and critical of Islam, you're banned from the U.S.
[00:41:27.148 --> 00:41:27.928]  That's what's going on.
[00:41:28.008 --> 00:41:38.934]  I've got a whole stack of news here we didn't even get to yesterday and new articles today where mainline reporters are being put in prison in Europe for saying simply that there is an Islamic rape culture coming to Europe.
[00:41:40.155 --> 00:41:46.919]  Swedish artist jail term extended after he committed hate crime of saying Muslim migrants have not integrated.
[00:41:47.259 --> 00:41:51.321]  That's right, you can say nothing negative, no speech beyond the Soviet Union.
[00:41:53.982 --> 00:41:54.283]  These are
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:07.006]  Let's go to Beto here, as much as we can get to Beto talking about how it's slavery here it is.
[00:42:08.553 --> 00:42:09.454]  Immigration.
[00:42:09.634 --> 00:42:15.757]  Millions living in the shadows, working some of the toughest jobs, lucky to make a minimum wage, some not even making that.
[00:42:16.297 --> 00:42:26.283]  Kept in modern day bondage, their immigration status used as leverage to keep them down from fully participating in this country's success and in our economy.
[00:42:26.743 --> 00:42:32.587]  An economy that works too well for too few and not well enough for most Americans.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.160]  You heard that.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:41.585]  It's slavery to come here illegally, and be able to have your baby for free, and get welfare, and then in Democrat cities, work undocumented.
[00:42:41.605 --> 00:42:43.466]  They use you as a permanent underclass.
[00:42:44.227 --> 00:42:46.308]  You see, they're the ones doing all this.
[00:42:46.789 --> 00:42:50.991]  They're the ones trying to keep the system like this so they have a permanent underclass.
[00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:53.653]  Then they point their finger at us and say we're the bad guys.
[00:42:55.174 --> 00:42:56.795]  Unbelievable guilt tripping.
[00:42:56.975 --> 00:42:57.456]  Beto.
[00:42:58.356 --> 00:42:59.677]  What a molester of the truth.
[00:42:59.737 --> 00:43:00.578]  What a degenerate.
[00:43:00.858 --> 00:43:02.259]  What a lying piece of filth.
[00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:12.412]  David Nino Rodriguez!
[00:43:12.733 --> 00:43:14.455]  DavidNinorodriguez.com.
[00:43:14.615 --> 00:43:19.282]  I'm familiar with his boxing career, but I'm not a big sports guy that has time to follow boxing.
[00:43:20.407 --> 00:43:27.673]  I do follow some of the heavyweight stuff, and I've also seen him on some national TV defending Trump, as some UFC fighters have done, and gotten a lot of criticism.
[00:43:28.174 --> 00:43:44.508]  But he is uniquely able to speak about this, because he grew up in El Paso, and saw the devastation on the border, and he's seen firsthand the abhorrent violence of gangs, sex, drug, and organ trafficking, and the alarming volume of criminal behavior committed by illegals on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border.
[00:43:44.568 --> 00:43:45.269]  Let's get into it!
[00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:49.774]  You live down there, and Trump says, really dangerous on one side, a lot safer on the other.
[00:43:50.114 --> 00:43:55.440]  He says walls make people safer, and the left says, oh no, there's nothing happening, Mexico's a wonderful place, there's no crime.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:00.246]  The big thing before the wall, I just want to clear this up, the big thing before the wall, the reason I know the wall worked,
[00:44:00.766 --> 00:44:01.367]  We're good to go!
[00:44:21.887 --> 00:44:37.120]  And they'd run right over there and put rocks in the street or 2x4s with nails and when a car would come it would hit the 2x4 with nails and it would come to a complete stop or it would hit the boulders and stop and then they would run out and carjack the people, take everything they had and sometimes even murder the people.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.622]  So that was just the lower element of crime.
[00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:44.286]  Or they would go and hijack or go steal from the containers of the Santa Fe train.
[00:44:44.406 --> 00:44:48.249]  Which they took so much merchandise off that train and then they'd go sell it in Mexico.
[00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:49.650]  So they would call that a hit.
[00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.453]  So they would go there and take a hit off the train, take a hit off someone driving a car.
[00:44:53.793 --> 00:44:55.754]  And this was easy to do.
[00:44:55.774 --> 00:44:57.115]  This is what they did every weekend.
[00:44:57.936 --> 00:44:59.337]  Every day, really, if they wanted to.
[00:44:59.357 --> 00:45:01.018]  It was just an ongoing thing.
[00:45:01.178 --> 00:45:03.860]  And that was just a lower element of criminal activity.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:09.865]  The higher criminal activity was when, 2006, when George Bush started building the wall and finished it during the Obama administration.
[00:45:09.885 --> 00:45:12.586]  Boy, did we see the cartels take over that city.
[00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:16.629]  I mean, the extortion and the killings of 50 to 100 people a day.
[00:45:16.709 --> 00:45:17.510]  It was like a war zone.
[00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:18.611]  It was like Iraq over there.
[00:45:19.053 --> 00:45:21.388]  And El Paso became, you know, coincidentally...
[00:45:22.091 --> 00:45:26.575]  The safest city, while Juarez became the number one murder capital of the world.
[00:45:26.715 --> 00:45:33.061]  And to see Beto O'Rourke, who's from my hometown, sell out to this idea, which he knows damn well that that wall has helped.
[00:45:33.241 --> 00:45:42.589]  I have a lot of friends that are Border Patrol agents in this area, and you know, as you know, the checkpoints are all closed down because they're dealing with such an influx of immigrants coming here.
[00:45:42.729 --> 00:45:45.231]  And these aren't people that are just from Mexico.
[00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:48.915]  This is, you know, as you know as well, you say it all the time, South America, Africa,
[00:45:50.196 --> 00:45:54.179]  They're all here, and they're getting 1,800 to 2,000 people a day.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.361]  That's how serious this is.
[00:45:55.901 --> 00:46:01.046]  I mean, we're being bombarded right now here at the border, and they're having to let these people go into general population.
[00:46:01.066 --> 00:46:07.892]  They're letting anywhere from 200 to 500 people a day, from what I understand the numbers, they're just letting them go into general population.
[00:46:08.092 --> 00:46:11.474]  And these people, these aren't just people with kids and, you know, families.
[00:46:11.494 --> 00:46:15.217]  These are grown men that we don't know what their objective is to come here.
[00:46:15.237 --> 00:46:15.637]  We don't know.
[00:46:15.717 --> 00:46:17.978]  I mean, a lot of these people grew up in crime in the community.
[00:46:17.998 --> 00:46:21.981]  You got to understand, like, Juarez, these third world countries, these people grow up with crime.
[00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:27.164]  So do you think they're coming here to America to sack groceries and to work at Albertsons or something like that?
[00:46:27.204 --> 00:46:28.164]  These people are coming here.
[00:46:28.465 --> 00:46:29.165]  They know one thing.
[00:46:29.205 --> 00:46:30.366]  They know how to make quick hits.
[00:46:30.386 --> 00:46:31.246]  I know these people.
[00:46:31.527 --> 00:46:36.870]  They know how to make a quick hit, do a drug deal, rob a house, do whatever, and have money to live on for a couple of weeks.
[00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.171]  That's what's coming over here.
[00:46:38.211 --> 00:46:42.255]  So these Democrats saying all this stuff about it's inhumane and unfair.
[00:46:42.295 --> 00:46:56.790]  The only thing that's inhumane is the sex trafficking and the people crossing here that have to go for ranges of miles and miles and miles without any food or water and the women being assaulted, the kids being used for, like I said, sex trafficking.
[00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:57.671]  That's what's inhumane.
[00:46:57.931 --> 00:46:59.072]  The wall will stop all that.
[00:47:06.425 --> 00:47:09.186]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.371 --> 00:47:31.853]  Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:47:32.844 --> 00:47:46.075]  I'm going to open the phones up in the next hour, and I've got a lot of news to cover as well, but I specifically want to talk to folks in the border states, where the millions of illegal aliens are, spreading diseases.
[00:47:46.615 --> 00:47:51.879]  You know, in the old days, when you came here legally, they would check you for diseases and quarantine you if they weren't sure.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.861]  They would say, oh, look at the Statue of Liberty.
[00:47:54.081 --> 00:47:56.723]  The Statue of Liberty sits on top of a quarantine center.
[00:47:59.125 --> 00:48:02.448]  Ellis Island has thousands and thousands of beds on it.
[00:48:04.192 --> 00:48:08.755]  Basically jail cells, because you have to get these people better before you let them in.
[00:48:10.297 --> 00:48:19.784]  And it makes me so angry that they've got the nerve to then say, arrest anybody who hasn't taken their vaccines, when it's a CDC-admitted fact that the vaccines don't protect you.
[00:48:20.785 --> 00:48:22.486]  And they sure don't protect you from new strains.
[00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.668]  And I already played all those newscasts yesterday.
[00:48:26.289 --> 00:48:27.410]  It's even on the news.
[00:48:29.138 --> 00:48:36.704]  But it's only on local news, because the health department in most areas are actually run by real doctors and real scientists, and they're telling people what's happening.
[00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:41.769]  Not the mayor of New York, no.
[00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:45.872]  He blames people that haven't been vaccinated, the Orthodox Jewish community.
[00:48:45.952 --> 00:48:46.713]  Just insane.
[00:48:48.539 --> 00:49:01.391]  Speaking of the Jewish community, in the third hour we have a Christian researcher coming on who has been exposing how the left is funding anti-Semitism in this country, just like George Soros has been caught doing, to create division.
[00:49:02.392 --> 00:49:12.421]  So they're behind the movement to fight anti-Semitism, the left, but they're also behind the main anti-Semitism, which is part of a clash of civilizations on a Galilean dialectic.
[00:49:13.345 --> 00:49:21.193]  Jan Ervin will be joining us to discuss that coming up in the third hour.
[00:49:21.273 --> 00:49:32.225]  But we're going to have open phones some then, too, specifically because you had two conservatives at this conservative synagogue, one Border Patrol and another an Army veteran.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:39.845]  Who got so outraged when this guy was shooting people, he did a war growl and went, I'm gonna kill you, and chased the guy down.
[00:49:40.406 --> 00:49:48.392]  The coward got in his car, was fumbling around, was about to shoot him, when finally the border patrol agent had gotten a gun from somebody else and stopped this guy.
[00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:50.694]  He only killed one person, that's still too many.
[00:49:51.535 --> 00:49:56.679]  Injured three others, but that coward thought he'd go in there and that no one would oppose him.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.902]  But because somebody charged him, he got run off his quarry.
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:11.765]  Again, it's such an illustration when you go online and YouTube leaves up all these accounts.
[00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:12.846]  And I say, fine, leave them up.
[00:50:12.886 --> 00:50:14.747]  I believe in free speech, even though I disagree with it.
[00:50:15.327 --> 00:50:24.252]  They leave David Duke's account up, which, by the way, is tame compared to some of these accounts with people saying Hitler's good and saying, kill all the Jews.
[00:50:24.752 --> 00:50:28.695]  And then, of course, the very same accounts say that I am a sellout to Israel.
[00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:31.986]  And that Steven Crowder is a sellout to Israel.
[00:50:32.527 --> 00:50:38.530]  And it's very, very hurtful because I don't say kill all the Muslims, even though I disagree with Islam.
[00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:43.473]  I don't say kill all the Mexicans, even though there are a lot of illegal Mexicans coming in.
[00:50:43.493 --> 00:50:44.634]  There's a lot of great Mexicans.
[00:50:45.154 --> 00:50:51.498]  You can't sit there and say a religion or a group of people, every one of them is bad.
[00:50:52.699 --> 00:50:57.822]  And then from what I know about Israel, and what I know about Jews, on average, is that they're very diverse.
[00:50:58.948 --> 00:51:10.777]  I mean, you've got the Hasidic Jews and a bunch of sub-sects, and you've got Orthodox, and you've got Liberal, and you've got Reformed, and you've got Agnostic, and you've got that strain of Jews that are Communists, just like you've got that in other groups.
[00:51:11.578 --> 00:51:20.905]  But it's just such a mental illness that there's a whole religion giving magical powers to Jews.
[00:51:22.887 --> 00:51:26.710]  You know, if anything, I've been persecuted by Jewish groups, by the ADL.
[00:51:28.032 --> 00:51:31.516]  By the Southern Poverty Law Center, it's got a lot of political leftist Jews in it.
[00:51:32.477 --> 00:51:38.483]  And their job is to sow racial division and discord, and to demonize America and capitalism as racism.
[00:51:39.885 --> 00:51:44.870]  And so there are some really mean, evil, bad leftists out there, and some of them happen to be Jews.
[00:51:45.331 --> 00:51:47.834]  But I'm not going to sink to their leftist race-based level.
[00:51:49.164 --> 00:51:51.246]  And teach all their race division like they do.
[00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:55.369]  I believe Martin Luther King, and it's about what ideas you have, what you stand for.
[00:51:55.749 --> 00:52:03.995]  But I'll say this to all of the people that bash Jews 24-7, like it's a little treat, a little special goody they're putting out.
[00:52:07.042 --> 00:52:14.105]  They've never made films about the USS Liberty being an Israeli false flag that LBJ was involved in as well to bring us into a war.
[00:52:14.365 --> 00:52:14.825]  That happened.
[00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:18.087]  I've interviewed Jews that were involved in their own military and said it was wrong.
[00:52:18.467 --> 00:52:19.567]  Governments do that sometimes.
[00:52:19.607 --> 00:52:19.987]  It's bad.
[00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:22.328]  All major governments do it.
[00:52:22.428 --> 00:52:22.808]  It's wrong.
[00:52:23.629 --> 00:52:24.269]  It's like torture.
[00:52:24.729 --> 00:52:25.610]  All governments tend to do it.
[00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:26.190]  It's bad.
[00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:41.096]  But the very people that say, I'm this Israeli operative, like a fetish, like a trophy they have all day long, because they're really just jealous of how hard we work and what we've built, never attack Trump as an Israeli operative.
[00:52:41.912 --> 00:52:53.843]  Even though he thinks Israel's a lot better than turning it over to the Muslims, and he likes Netanyahu, and likes having a friend in the region, and they buy a lot of our weapons, and a lot of our products, and if he turned it over to the Muslims, they'd all be killing each other in about an hour.
[00:52:54.003 --> 00:52:57.967]  It's very sad, and Saudi Arabia doesn't take one Palestinian in, but Israel's supposed to.
[00:52:59.448 --> 00:53:04.772]  But notice, Trump's daughter is married to an Orthodox Jew, Jared Kushner.
[00:53:05.313 --> 00:53:07.975]  Trump's vehemently pro-Israel.
[00:53:08.656 --> 00:53:12.159]  And you never hear a word out of the QAnon group saying, I'm an Israeli agent.
[00:53:12.979 --> 00:53:14.741]  Because, see, they can't take Trump on.
[00:53:16.282 --> 00:53:18.624]  They've got to siphon off and claim they speak for Trump.
[00:53:21.787 --> 00:53:27.051]  And then, Pence is with some sheriff's deputies that mean well, and not everybody involved in the Q movement's bad.
[00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:27.692]  A lot of them are good.
[00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:32.540]  They do some Q thing, and then Pence sees it and deletes it.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.941]  And I'm not in competition with the, quote, nebulous, anonymous Q thing.
[00:53:38.241 --> 00:53:41.041]  It's like the anonymous Internet situation.
[00:53:41.381 --> 00:53:43.182]  People said, are you for anonymous 10 years ago?
[00:53:43.962 --> 00:53:48.263]  And I said, I can dress up in a Guy Fawkes mask and put out anonymous stuff on anonymous channels.
[00:53:48.283 --> 00:53:48.923]  You never know it's me.
[00:53:49.503 --> 00:53:50.503]  I could put out whatever I wanted.
[00:53:50.543 --> 00:53:52.303]  Do you just trust some anonymous thing?
[00:53:53.583 --> 00:53:56.244]  Now, if some anonymous source keeps giving you things that prove to be accurate, great.
[00:53:58.251 --> 00:54:00.073]  But most of what Q said wasn't true.
[00:54:00.493 --> 00:54:06.518]  Some of it was true, but only because Mueller came up empty and Trump has him by the short hairs they had to back off.
[00:54:06.899 --> 00:54:08.840]  Not because Mueller was a good guy the whole time.
[00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:11.523]  I know for a fact Trump doesn't like Mueller.
[00:54:12.964 --> 00:54:15.066]  People said, oh, Sessions is really good.
[00:54:15.366 --> 00:54:18.829]  No, Trump genuinely didn't like Jeff Sessions and thought he was a coward.
[00:54:21.171 --> 00:54:22.292]  So all I'm saying is,
[00:54:26.004 --> 00:54:28.227]  That this becomes a diversion and a distraction.
[00:54:28.487 --> 00:54:30.170]  Who did you have in that conservative synagogue?
[00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.553]  A border patrol agent that happened to be Jewish.
[00:54:33.374 --> 00:54:36.519]  And was trying to go for Passover to be part of his culture and his God.
[00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:41.546]  And then another army veteran, decorated patriot,
[00:54:43.274 --> 00:54:46.175]  Who had courage to stand up against that guy, and then we just say these people are crap.
[00:54:46.855 --> 00:54:47.556]  Let me tell you something.
[00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:52.377]  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you're Christian, or if you're Jewish, or whether you're an agnostic.
[00:54:52.898 --> 00:54:56.419]  And there are a lot of Muslims, too, that a lot of Muslims would call heretics, but they want to live in peace.
[00:54:56.799 --> 00:55:02.101]  What matters is if you believe in free market, and freedom, and America, and the Second Amendment, and family.
[00:55:03.302 --> 00:55:07.263]  And you stand for that, and you believe in the nation-state, then we're all bound together by that.
[00:55:07.503 --> 00:55:11.805]  And I guarantee you, if you took the average little troll, wannabe Nazi online,
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:25.823]  And if you took them to one of these conservative synagogues, and they actually met and talked to those people, you'd find smart, compelling, hard-working, good people that care about this country, and who understand the threat to this nation.
[00:55:26.743 --> 00:55:40.106]  Now, if you go to some leftist church, or some leftist synagogue, or some leftist mosque, you're gonna find the scum of the earth that hate this country, and hate the family, and hate God, who've captured churches.
[00:55:42.125 --> 00:55:46.228]  Who've captured churches and synagogues to tell us there is no God.
[00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:49.090]  That God is dead, because they want to be God.
[00:55:50.651 --> 00:55:52.492]  So it's just not reality-based.
[00:55:53.652 --> 00:55:57.775]  And so I challenge people out there that attack me, and I'm not responding to you because your attacks hurt me.
[00:55:58.335 --> 00:56:03.039]  I'm responding because I know a lot of you are just in your own form of group psychosis, groupthink.
[00:56:04.159 --> 00:56:08.022]  And you really attribute magical powers to Jews like they're leprechauns or something.
[00:56:08.977 --> 00:56:13.961]  And, but you attack me because that's the popular algorithm that the left allows online.
[00:56:14.342 --> 00:56:18.545]  You got some anti-Semitic Alex Jones rant, baby, Google greenlights you all the way.
[00:56:19.586 --> 00:56:23.649]  You've got some unity situation, like I promote Google bans your ass.
[00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:24.750]  They don't want unity.
[00:56:25.291 --> 00:56:26.652]  I'm really trying to make things work here.
[00:56:27.252 --> 00:56:30.976]  But remember, the Owen Benjamins of the world
[00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:37.299]  Talented comedian, nice guy I had on, until I found out he was saying Germany had a great leader in the early 40s.
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:38.440]  Bullcrap!
[00:56:38.721 --> 00:56:40.263]  Hitler was a psychotic demon.
[00:56:40.704 --> 00:56:42.587]  Both my grandfathers almost died fighting him.
[00:56:43.207 --> 00:56:45.611]  And they saw the dead bodies, they saw the piles of dead people.
[00:56:46.112 --> 00:56:46.953]  Don't give me that crap.
[00:56:47.898 --> 00:56:49.621]  That I'm censoring or I sold out.
[00:56:49.701 --> 00:56:50.081]  No, dude.
[00:56:50.322 --> 00:56:51.103]  You're on YouTube.
[00:56:51.243 --> 00:56:51.604]  I'm not.
[00:56:51.924 --> 00:56:53.707]  I'm under attack and banned everywhere.
[00:56:53.947 --> 00:56:55.229]  They've taken my bank accounts away.
[00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:56.671]  They're trying to shut us down right now.
[00:56:56.892 --> 00:56:58.394]  I've been sued 20-something times.
[00:56:58.935 --> 00:56:59.796]  I'm on the front lines.
[00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:00.677]  I'm changing the world.
[00:57:00.878 --> 00:57:01.739]  And our audience is.
[00:57:02.657 --> 00:57:06.758]  And people like Owen sit there and say, oh, you know, Trump's great, but, oh, Jones is a sellout to Israel.
[00:57:07.018 --> 00:57:12.259]  No, go after Trump, then, that you don't have the huevos, because the anti-Semites won't do it.
[00:57:12.539 --> 00:57:13.660]  And I'm sorry you're Jewish.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.760]  You don't like your dad, Owen.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.161]  Sorry you got daddy issues, bro.
[00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:18.961]  I don't have daddy issues with my dad.
[00:57:18.981 --> 00:57:21.842]  My dad's just a red-blooded American.
[00:57:22.382 --> 00:57:27.043]  He never told me, hey, I'm English and Irish and Scottish and American Indian.
[00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:27.863]  That's who we are.
[00:57:28.063 --> 00:57:29.944]  He brought me up that we're Americans.
[00:57:30.424 --> 00:57:31.344]  We believe in freedom.
[00:57:33.447 --> 00:57:34.347]  That's what it came down to.
[00:57:35.548 --> 00:57:37.829]  Please don't forget, we're only here because of your support.
[00:57:38.009 --> 00:57:39.790]  We've got great products and new super sales.
[00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:51.176]  You can get a free bottle of X3 that's amazing, with all three of the good halogens in it, all three types of iodine, when you get it with a bottle of X2, the pure, deep-earth crystal iodine, at InfoWorks4.com.
[00:57:55.214 --> 00:57:57.315]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:57:57.435 --> 00:58:03.776]  Yeah, so real quickly, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro because I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[00:58:03.796 --> 00:58:11.538]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country, because you got glyphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a septic tank.
[00:58:11.698 --> 00:58:13.779]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:16.139]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.840]  And by the way, I forget to do this to get mad.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.063]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[00:58:22.404 --> 00:58:26.587]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[00:58:26.767 --> 00:58:29.870]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:42.381]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century, and I have zero, zero phase.
[00:58:43.342 --> 00:58:48.850]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.875]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[00:58:53.156 --> 00:58:56.921]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[00:58:57.041 --> 00:58:58.242]  And I'll never forget David Hogg.
[00:58:58.683 --> 00:59:01.844]  He goes, you know Alex Jones on C-SPAN, he goes, little anti-gun guy.
[00:59:02.004 --> 00:59:06.745]  He goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[00:59:06.905 --> 00:59:15.007]  Yeah, it's like saying, your kids need vitamin C and then I sell vitamin C. Or, Jones says we need to wear shoes.
[00:59:15.227 --> 00:59:16.227]  We walk in the snow.
[00:59:16.647 --> 00:59:17.847]  Then he advertises shoes.
[00:59:18.067 --> 00:59:18.967]  Yes, exactly.
[00:59:19.288 --> 00:59:20.708]  But see, in his little brain...
[00:59:21.328 --> 00:59:22.768]  Where everything is a scam.
[00:59:23.248 --> 00:59:26.089]  He thinks I'm scamming people when it's a direct sale.
[00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.849]  We have the best gravity-fed systems.
[00:59:27.889 --> 00:59:30.470]  Alexa Pure and Pro Pure are apples and oranges, but they're both excellent.
[00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:31.490]  Everyone needs it.
[00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:32.891]  Everyone should filter their water.
[00:59:32.911 --> 00:59:34.271]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:36.411]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant.
[00:59:36.451 --> 00:59:38.172]  But you need to filter your water.
[00:59:38.292 --> 00:59:39.732]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[00:59:39.792 --> 00:59:40.792]  You absorb it there.
[00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:43.573]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:44.633]  Exactly.
[00:59:44.733 --> 00:59:46.514]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[00:59:46.674 --> 00:59:47.754]  It's insane!
[00:59:56.983 --> 01:00:00.787]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:19.065 --> 01:00:35.047]  Is there a chemical doorway inside the mind that opens up, and the belief is that when you die, and this is what the afterlife is, that when you die, your brain produces these chemicals, these chemicals open up this doorway, and this is the portal to the next dimension.
[01:00:42.694 --> 01:01:04.008]  I have heard, that I have talked to Army Generals, Commanding Generals, Major Generals, General Generals, CIA, everybody, and they're all 100%, and I thought it was a sign up before, and I've researched it, I've talked to hundreds of people now, not on air, but I'm going to make a film on this, who've taken Ayahuasca and DMT, I've not taken it.
[01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:26.956]  And, for obvious reasons, and it's unbelievable because, I mean, they 100% in San Francisco is the main project site, literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating and they've got like astronaut level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making intergalactic deals.
[01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:30.618]  And again, that's what the government believes and says they're doing.
[01:01:31.578 --> 01:01:33.459]  When you say the government, that's a broad stroke.
[01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:36.382]  You're painting a, you're using a broad brush.
[01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:37.423]  What do you mean by the government?
[01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:40.105]  Break away rogue intelligence agencies.
[01:01:40.125 --> 01:01:45.591]  Okay, so what you're saying is essentially that they're using psychedelic drugs to communicate with interdimensional beings.
[01:01:45.611 --> 01:01:46.392]  Alright.
[01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:47.573]  That's spirit guides.
[01:01:47.673 --> 01:01:47.933]  Okay.
[01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:51.717]  You're saying that the government is aware of this and they must be aware of this.
[01:01:51.737 --> 01:01:53.099]  They've heard enough people talk about it.
[01:01:53.139 --> 01:01:54.380]  They must have done experiments on it.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.760]  What do scientists do?
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:57.001]  They want to know the secrets of the universe.
[01:01:57.101 --> 01:01:57.461]  For sure.
[01:01:57.481 --> 01:02:15.065]  And people that have the courage to experiment with these things and try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience that it is, it's so alien that if an alien landed right now in our parking lot and a little gray man with big black eyes got out, it would be nothing compared to what I've seen.
[01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:16.766]  On psychedelic trips.
[01:02:16.786 --> 01:02:22.891]  Well let me just tell you, me getting into this show is just because people need to understand that I've known about this for a long time.
[01:02:23.691 --> 01:02:25.273]  And I just don't think people are ready for it.
[01:02:25.573 --> 01:02:27.254]  It was actually a horrible experience.
[01:02:27.394 --> 01:02:27.594]  Really?
[01:02:27.714 --> 01:02:28.675]  That was my worst.
[01:02:28.855 --> 01:02:29.656]  I had a great experience.
[01:02:29.776 --> 01:02:30.056]  You did?
[01:02:30.196 --> 01:02:30.457]  Yeah.
[01:02:30.657 --> 01:02:32.498]  What was wrong with it?
[01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:41.017]  I, you know, you take like one puff and before you exhale, um, I was, and this is synthetic version too, right?
[01:02:41.077 --> 01:02:42.078]  I was taking the venom.
[01:02:42.478 --> 01:02:44.580]  Um, you're shot out of a cannon.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.441]  There's no lead up.
[01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.541]  It's no warm up.
[01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:57.791]  It's like, and I felt like I was actually like strapped to the outside of a rocket, you know, going through space and through clouds and like the G-forces pulling down my cheeks.
[01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:01.874]  And it was just this mental storm without any,
[01:03:03.355 --> 01:03:04.475]  Nothing to orient myself.
[01:03:04.555 --> 01:03:05.535]  There was no space.
[01:03:05.595 --> 01:03:06.496]  There was no time.
[01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.396]  There was no self.
[01:03:08.776 --> 01:03:11.737]  And it was just unendurable.
[01:03:11.757 --> 01:03:13.617]  This punishing roar in my ears.
[01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:14.357]  It was horrible.
[01:03:14.397 --> 01:03:15.057]  It was terrifying.
[01:03:15.077 --> 01:03:15.997]  I remember being a kid.
[01:03:16.497 --> 01:03:18.878]  And my parents, they don't really get mad about this.
[01:03:18.898 --> 01:03:19.158]  It's whatever.
[01:03:19.178 --> 01:03:20.458]  They didn't even know what they were hearing at the time.
[01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:24.039]  But they had friends that they knew at UT that were involved in research projects.
[01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:29.060]  And then they were... Nine times out of ten, I heard about research projects in San Francisco.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.260]  UT has some.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.180]  MIT has a lot.
[01:03:32.556 --> 01:03:36.860]  Talk any time you want, but this was in like the 60s.
[01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:43.847]  The intention is to use this technology to explore and map the DMT realm.
[01:03:44.047 --> 01:03:56.318]  It looks like Imperial College London is going to deploy this technology in further research into DMT and that that research is not going to be purely and simply into the therapeutic potential
[01:03:56.878 --> 01:04:05.962]  Of a psychedelic, which is very important research to do, it's going to be an investigation into the nature of reality using a psychedelic, the mysterious nature of reality.
[01:04:06.002 --> 01:04:21.948]  And it is odd, and you know this from personal experience, that when you get plunged into that DMT realm, it is so different from the realm of our daily world, filled with geometry, filled with these sprightly intelligences, completely internally coherent.
[01:04:22.268 --> 01:04:25.449]  How can that be, you know, generated by the brain?
[01:04:25.809 --> 01:04:29.411]  Or are we dealing with some other level of reality that we haven't encountered yet?
[01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:38.877]  I think that ancient cultures, and in particular, my lost civilization, were deeply involved in exploring the mysterious nature of reality.
[01:04:39.137 --> 01:04:47.662]  They had virtual reality gloves, where you'd put them on and put goggles on, and you'd go into stuff that looked like the holodeck from Star Trek, 20 years before it existed.
[01:04:47.682 --> 01:04:49.083]  This was patented in 1957.
[01:04:49.183 --> 01:04:50.904]  It's a VR machine.
[01:04:51.404 --> 01:04:51.844]  Exactly.
[01:04:51.945 --> 01:04:52.545]  No, exactly.
[01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:53.606]  That's crazy!
[01:05:05.174 --> 01:05:11.918]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:05:12.519 --> 01:05:15.080]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:16.541]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[01:05:17.222 --> 01:05:19.403]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:20.884]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:05:21.404 --> 01:05:27.428]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:05:27.868 --> 01:05:29.830]  So remember, you are the InfoWarrant.
[01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:31.071]  I'm not the leader.
[01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:31.972]  You are the leader.
[01:05:32.172 --> 01:05:33.773]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:05:34.153 --> 01:05:38.898]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsTore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:05:39.558 --> 01:05:47.005]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:05:47.025 --> 01:05:48.346]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:05:48.726 --> 01:05:49.627]  I want to encourage you again.
[01:05:50.127 --> 01:05:54.789]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:57.831]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[01:05:58.191 --> 01:06:00.112]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:03.154]  God bless you.
[01:06:12.078 --> 01:06:17.001]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.305 --> 01:06:27.507]  It's Monday, April 29th, 2019.
[01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:29.649]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:31.550]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:34.673]  I need to open the phones up, starting at the next segment.
[01:06:36.114 --> 01:06:37.775]  So, our borders are wide open.
[01:06:37.876 --> 01:06:40.137]  Illegal aliens are allowed to come in with any disease they want.
[01:06:40.157 --> 01:06:41.038]  They're not even screened.
[01:06:41.499 --> 01:06:42.800]  They're allowed to spread it all over the country.
[01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:56.584]  Local governments admit that the spread of measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, so many other diseases that are even more serious, like drug-resistant tuberculosis, are coming from the illegal aliens in every case and then spreading from there.
[01:06:57.865 --> 01:07:04.350]  But meanwhile, the mayor of New York is ordering forced inoculations of Orthodox Jews
[01:07:05.475 --> 01:07:11.659]  Because Leviticus says don't put somebody else's blood or seed inside of your body.
[01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:16.602]  Sounds like a smart thing to do, you know, unless you're a woman and it's your husband.
[01:07:17.843 --> 01:07:19.564]  I mean, because this is some serious business.
[01:07:19.584 --> 01:07:20.645]  It's how you get diseases.
[01:07:20.665 --> 01:07:22.206]  It's how you get contamination.
[01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:24.307]  And they admit these vaccines are full of contaminants.
[01:07:25.628 --> 01:07:28.970]  And so now, measles scare delays flight to New York City.
[01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:33.113]  JetBlue accused of profiling orthodox boy.
[01:07:34.656 --> 01:07:42.979]  So everybody else can come into the country undocumented, but if you come undocumented or you're just flying around inside the U.S., oh, I heard the Jews have the disease.
[01:07:42.999 --> 01:07:45.760]  Isn't this weird?
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.940]  It was Hitler who said the Jews were carrying diseases.
[01:07:49.321 --> 01:07:50.961]  So, see, you can't profile an illegal alien.
[01:07:53.182 --> 01:07:54.663]  But you can profile those Jews.
[01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:55.063]  Here it is.
[01:07:56.457 --> 01:08:01.899]  The Port Authority temporarily quarantined that plane while the passengers got checked out tonight.
[01:08:01.959 --> 01:08:09.301]  That plane had just landed from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic at a time, of course, when our area is in the midst of a measles outbreak.
[01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:13.342]  News 4's Wale Ali was live at JFK with what we're learning about this scare.
[01:08:13.362 --> 01:08:13.662]  Wale?
[01:08:15.723 --> 01:08:25.806]  Yeah, Adam and Jumi, after being on a plane for four and a half hours, coming all the way from Santo Domingo to here at JFK, passengers had to wait a little bit longer before the planing.
[01:08:26.992 --> 01:08:34.106]  We thought might have an issue that was of concern and the Port Authority wanted to check it out before we entered a terminal with a whole bunch of people.
[01:08:34.566 --> 01:08:36.510]  It turns out that everything is just fine.
[01:08:38.871 --> 01:08:48.362]  You just heard crews on board the aircraft giving the all clear to the passengers on flight 410 after medics had to come on board and make sure no one on the flight had measles.
[01:08:48.862 --> 01:09:00.215]  Representatives from JetBlue told us they got reports of a medical emergency on board the flight and then requested to hold the plane for medical services out of an abundance of caution so a customer could be examined.
[01:09:00.535 --> 01:09:07.285]  The flight landed around 9 p.m., but it wasn't until about 40 minutes ago that we started seeing some of these passengers come out after going through customs.
[01:09:07.646 --> 01:09:15.737]  The passengers told me they didn't really know what was happening on the plane, but rumors were circulating that someone on board may have had measles.
[01:09:17.842 --> 01:09:25.771]  Court authority got some sort of medic-type guy to come on with a mask, and a policeman probably caught authority with a mask.
[01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:29.815]  Looked at the kid, decided that it was probably mosquito bites.
[01:09:30.276 --> 01:09:32.638]  Left everybody on the plane, said everything was fine.
[01:09:35.325 --> 01:09:38.389]  Now, we also spoke with a Passover program director.
[01:09:38.429 --> 01:09:41.272]  He told us he organized this trip for Orthodox families.
[01:09:41.793 --> 01:09:48.901]  He tells us JetBlue Crew saw an Orthodox Jew with mosquito bites and unfairly profiled him as having measles.
[01:09:48.961 --> 01:09:54.948]  Now, with almost 700 cases in the U.S., there have been almost 400 cases of measles confirmed in New York since the outbreak.
[01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:56.529]  So let's walk through all the BS here.
[01:10:20.615 --> 01:10:22.857]  Number one, maybe a couple deaths total.
[01:10:22.877 --> 01:10:24.378]  They act like measles is the end of the world.
[01:10:24.478 --> 01:10:24.638]  No.
[01:10:25.178 --> 01:10:26.920]  They're covering up drug-resistant TB.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.402]  They're covering up the black plague, bubonic plague.
[01:10:29.422 --> 01:10:31.703]  They're covering up all these things, killing a bunch of people.
[01:10:32.684 --> 01:10:36.207]  They're covering up all people dying in the desert of Mexico before they get here of diseases.
[01:10:36.907 --> 01:10:38.749]  They're covering up this illegal aliens triggering it.
[01:10:39.809 --> 01:10:43.152]  But then, oh my gosh, they see an Orthodox Jew flying in.
[01:10:43.612 --> 01:10:44.613]  They got mosquito bites.
[01:10:44.733 --> 01:10:46.835]  Quite frankly, should have been tested.
[01:10:47.742 --> 01:10:50.944]  If there's a measles outbreak, but so should the illegal aliens.
[01:10:51.525 --> 01:10:52.325]  They should be stopped.
[01:10:52.365 --> 01:11:01.492]  But see, AOC says you have no right to stop anybody coming in to the United States, period.
[01:11:03.053 --> 01:11:04.414]  It's just, it's madness.
[01:11:04.474 --> 01:11:05.235]  It's insane.
[01:11:06.576 --> 01:11:10.779]  But again, don't blame those of us that know the measles vaccine never protects you anyways.
[01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:14.301]  And don't blame those of us that know that it hardly ever kills anybody.
[01:11:14.621 --> 01:11:16.563]  Maybe one out of five million that get it, literally.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:27.308]  No, this whole measles thing is a cover for all the real diseases spreading in this country, like drug-resistant pertussis out of the third world that's killing a bunch of people.
[01:11:27.548 --> 01:11:28.048]  And guess what?
[01:11:28.068 --> 01:11:29.429]  The vaccine doesn't protect you.
[01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:30.690]  Look up its own insert.
[01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:34.193]  They'll admit, oh, all the strains that are out now, we don't have one for that.
[01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.374]  They still tell you, get it!
[01:11:36.314 --> 01:11:38.636]  Even though it doesn't protect you, it lowers your immunity.
[01:11:38.976 --> 01:11:41.518]  Every time you take a vaccine, it lowers your general immunity.
[01:11:42.019 --> 01:11:44.821]  It may teach you immunity to one thing, but it messes you up.
[01:11:45.161 --> 01:11:45.742]  Look it up.
[01:11:45.942 --> 01:11:47.223]  I showed all the articles yesterday.
[01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:51.197]  I want to queue up the AOC club again in a minute.
[01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:55.921]  We're going to play this other one first, where she specifically says, though, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:11:56.481 --> 01:11:57.602]  She says, I don't care where you're coming from.
[01:11:57.622 --> 01:11:58.703]  You have a right to be here, period.
[01:11:58.963 --> 01:12:02.546]  And you have a right for everything to be free, just like she said in her Green Deal.
[01:12:03.167 --> 01:12:04.928]  Those that can't work or don't want to work.
[01:12:05.249 --> 01:12:07.150]  Well, then who's got to work, you dumbass?
[01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:09.632]  It's called slavery if I got to pay for somebody.
[01:12:10.853 --> 01:12:14.457]  But O'Rourke says if we don't have open borders, give folks free things, that's slavery.
[01:12:15.856 --> 01:12:16.296]  Incredible.
[01:12:17.157 --> 01:12:28.952]  But here he is again, ABC News admitting, and Fox admitting, I've got a bunch of these, admitting that the patient zeros, this is a Fox News piece, is the illegal aliens.
[01:12:28.972 --> 01:12:29.292]  Here it is.
[01:12:30.427 --> 01:12:40.254]  Normally when it comes to measles, we do have small outbreaks that happen in the United States, but those cases usually happen when travelers from abroad come and bring the illness.
[01:12:41.214 --> 01:12:51.461]  Having said that, the more recent generation of parents have not vaccinated as many children, so the potential for it to be spread has increased, which heightens our fear.
[01:12:51.861 --> 01:12:55.444]  And now of this year, of late this year, we have five cases in L.A.
[01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.786]  County of actual documented measles cases.
[01:13:02.008 --> 01:13:04.189]  And then let's go to that Fox News clip that I just mentioned.
[01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:06.251]  The clip I wanted to go to.
[01:13:07.151 --> 01:13:08.652]  This is Fox News.
[01:13:09.513 --> 01:13:12.255]  Officials admit illegal aliens started measles epidemic.
[01:13:12.575 --> 01:13:15.237]  That was AP admitting it too in California, but here's New York.
[01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:21.372]  New York County has declared a state of emergency.
[01:13:21.592 --> 01:13:26.914]  Starting today, children not vaccinated against the measles virus are banned from public places.
[01:13:26.994 --> 01:13:32.095]  So far, there are 153 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County.
[01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:35.756]  The Rockland County Executive Ed Day joins me now.
[01:13:36.137 --> 01:13:37.117]  Why did you take the step?
[01:13:37.737 --> 01:13:40.478]  I took this step because we've been battling this for six months.
[01:13:40.558 --> 01:13:46.439]  Six months ago we had seven infected individuals come from overseas to a local community in Rockland County.
[01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:53.560]  The health department did a wonderful job with the mission of minimizing exposures and maximizing... Okay, so there you go.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.000]  Came from overseas.
[01:13:55.121 --> 01:13:56.741]  So it's the same thing over and over again.
[01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.342]  So it's fine to actually, if you see somebody who looks like they have smallpox, to check them.
[01:14:01.102 --> 01:14:01.902]  But the only reason
[01:14:02.967 --> 01:14:09.050]  They did it was because the guy was an Orthodox Jew, and they need to quote, look out for that, because they heard, oh, it's the Jews in New York.
[01:14:10.691 --> 01:14:13.393]  Who are having, by the way, parties at their houses like everybody else does.
[01:14:13.853 --> 01:14:16.635]  When somebody's got it, bring the kid over, get it all done at once.
[01:14:16.975 --> 01:14:20.897]  You want to get your kids sick with it when they're not run down, but when they're healthy.
[01:14:21.698 --> 01:14:26.080]  Which is a form of natural inoculation people have done for thousands of years, and statistically much, much better.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.222]  You get a fever, get a few spots, you're done.
[01:14:30.589 --> 01:14:34.523]  But if you get measles when you're super run down, it's the only time you can get brain damaged or die.
[01:14:34.544 --> 01:14:35.989]  And it's still incredibly rare.
[01:14:37.133 --> 01:14:45.179]  Here's the toll-free number to join us on the Open Borders, this form of biological attack the deep state's engaged in against our nation, against Trump flip-flopping.
[01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:46.160]  We'll get to those video clips.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.082]  I think this is one of the big central issues.
[01:14:49.582 --> 01:14:51.523]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:14:51.543 --> 01:14:51.944]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[01:14:51.964 --> 01:14:52.004]  877-789-2539.
[01:14:52.044 --> 01:14:53.345]  First-time callers in this hour.
[01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:55.626]  First-time callers, please.
[01:15:07.115 --> 01:15:17.867]  877-789-2539 or if you've called in and been on hold and not gotten in, we'll also take that call and give new callers a chance though.
[01:15:17.887 --> 01:15:18.127]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:18.768 --> 01:15:25.595]  Just please give me your take on this national emergency and what you think Trump should do and why you think he's starting to flip-flop on vaccines.
[01:15:25.635 --> 01:15:27.417]  Very, very scary point and then
[01:15:28.404 --> 01:15:30.226]  We're going to get into all the other subjects.
[01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:33.228]  French Imam tells Muslims not to donate money.
[01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:34.609]  Rebuilding Notre Dame.
[01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:36.731]  Wait till you see all the other Islamic invasion news.
[01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.793]  And the incredible censorship news.
[01:15:39.173 --> 01:15:41.255]  And that other news that I mentioned but didn't get to.
[01:15:41.856 --> 01:15:45.499]  Major colleges are teaching that babies are cancer and you need to kill them.
[01:15:46.243 --> 01:15:46.784]  I'm not kidding.
[01:15:46.824 --> 01:15:47.785]  Adan Salazar.
[01:15:48.185 --> 01:15:49.386]  Infowars.com.
[01:15:49.426 --> 01:15:50.287]  Get this article out.
[01:15:50.728 --> 01:15:54.331]  College biology course compares fetus to cancer and a parasite.
[01:15:54.972 --> 01:15:56.053]  Infowars.com.
[01:15:56.433 --> 01:15:57.654]  Newswars.com.
[01:15:57.875 --> 01:15:59.196]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:59.576 --> 01:16:00.597]  Spread those links.
[01:16:00.998 --> 01:16:01.658]  It's critical.
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.322]  The globalists are hammering humanity with bad halogens.
[01:16:06.783 --> 01:16:08.084]  Fluoride being chief amongst them.
[01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:13.488]  Well, all they try to keep the one good halogen out of the food supply, and that's iodine.
[01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:16.310]  But most iodine isn't pure, so you can't absorb it.
[01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:17.011]  Well, guess what?
[01:16:17.131 --> 01:16:19.252]  X2's back in stock, and it's discounted.
[01:16:19.272 --> 01:16:24.056]  And when you get a bottle of the original X2, you get a free bottle of X3 to see how amazing it is.
[01:16:24.556 --> 01:16:26.698]  Only at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:27.118 --> 01:16:28.099]  Now, stay with us.
[01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:30.021]  I'll break down the latest developments.
[01:16:42.877 --> 01:16:44.139]  There is a war.
[01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:45.600]  It's happening now.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.262]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:16:48.823 --> 01:16:51.085]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:16:51.405 --> 01:16:52.927]  We are the resistance.
[01:16:53.327 --> 01:16:54.928]  We are the Infowar.
[01:17:01.749 --> 01:17:05.959]  There are a lot of people out there that say they're on the front lines of the fight for liberty.
[01:17:06.741 --> 01:17:07.202]  And some are.
[01:17:08.786 --> 01:17:10.408]  But I'm not doing this to be famous.
[01:17:10.488 --> 01:17:12.129]  I'm doing this because it was the right thing to do.
[01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:14.692]  And let me tell you, I've gotten deep into this fight.
[01:17:15.453 --> 01:17:18.896]  And I've got the globalists pulling out every stop and every dirty trick you can imagine.
[01:17:19.597 --> 01:17:31.748]  But because you've stood with Infowars, because you've spread the word, and because you've bought the products we sell, the funder operations, we are here in the face of the globalist tyranny being more aggressive and more effective than ever.
[01:17:32.469 --> 01:17:33.510]  I just went to D.C.
[01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:38.634]  and bullhorned the president while Jack Dorsey was inside, lying, saying they don't censor conservatives.
[01:17:39.235 --> 01:17:42.618]  Ilhan Omar is calling for Trump to be banned, for God's sakes.
[01:17:43.318 --> 01:17:44.199]  And we were in D.C.
[01:17:44.219 --> 01:17:52.226]  doing dozens of major interviews and really affecting change and getting the president to go after the deep state with criminal charges, which you heard about years ago.
[01:17:52.446 --> 01:17:54.548]  And now the president's finally getting ready to do it.
[01:17:55.248 --> 01:17:56.731]  We are the real change agents.
[01:17:56.831 --> 01:17:59.015]  We are effective because we tell the truth.
[01:17:59.696 --> 01:18:02.862]  But without you backing us, we won't be here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:03.383 --> 01:18:06.889]  Without you supporting us, the globalists will be able to shut us down.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:13.425]  Please understand that my philosophy is to give you the very best information out there.
[01:18:14.145 --> 01:18:17.588]  And my philosophy with products we sell to fund ourselves is very simple.
[01:18:18.289 --> 01:18:27.217]  Sell the highest quality that I, myself, and my family take, give it to you at a great price so that it's a win-win, so you continue to want to come back and get it over and over again.
[01:18:27.818 --> 01:18:31.321]  We're running two new specials for one week and one week only.
[01:18:32.302 --> 01:18:33.403]  The biggest one ever is
[01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:36.531]  X2, we were able to get back in stock.
[01:18:36.691 --> 01:18:38.152]  Deep Earth, pure iodine crystals.
[01:18:38.972 --> 01:18:42.233]  Read about iodine deficiency, how it has lower IQs, you don't have it.
[01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:45.175]  Boosted IQs, how it's the building block of the whole body.
[01:18:45.695 --> 01:18:47.396]  Just as essential as water or oxygen.
[01:18:47.716 --> 01:18:50.177]  We have the true pure iodine that you can absorb.
[01:18:50.197 --> 01:18:52.258]  About 98% of people can.
[01:18:53.239 --> 01:18:55.480]  And it's just a game changer.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:56.760]  We have it back in stock.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.401]  And when you get one bottle of X2, already 25% off.
[01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:00.962]  Already a great deal.
[01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:07.354]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[01:19:07.935 --> 01:19:08.756]  Absolutely free.
[01:19:09.176 --> 01:19:13.240]  Now, we sat out with top scientists and said, could we make X2 better?
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.641]  This has the deep-earth crystals in it.
[01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:15.162]  X3 does.
[01:19:15.442 --> 01:19:16.283]  And they said, yes.
[01:19:16.963 --> 01:19:23.289]  You'd have the other two types of iodine in there because a low percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:25.431]  Just like most people can't absorb
[01:19:26.392 --> 01:19:28.193]  Iodine that isn't atomic.
[01:19:28.653 --> 01:19:29.914]  So again, it's a catch-22.
[01:19:30.414 --> 01:19:32.195]  So we created X3.
[01:19:32.656 --> 01:19:38.899]  Now, X3 is weaker on purpose, because again, some people can't handle the strongest iodine.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.722]  Consult your physician before you take it, because this is real stuff.
[01:19:43.562 --> 01:19:49.206]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, get a bottle of X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:49.686 --> 01:19:57.130]  Incredibly popular, thousands of five-star reviews, and get a free bottle of X3 so you can experience how amazing it is as well.
[01:19:57.571 --> 01:20:00.833]  InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[01:20:01.313 --> 01:20:02.454]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:20:06.316 --> 01:20:08.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:50.001 --> 01:20:51.964]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:52.184 --> 01:20:55.309]  All right, we're gonna start going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:20:58.473 --> 01:21:04.982]  But let me run over some of the other news we haven't hit yet that I'll be getting into in more detail coming up.
[01:21:06.539 --> 01:21:16.583]  Suddenly, CNN, ABC News, they're all reporting on how Alexa of Amazon is listening to you with real people listening and basically codifying and selling your data.
[01:21:17.104 --> 01:21:33.791]  You see, once it's admitted, once it's out in the open, once it's ubiquitous, once it's been accepted, once people are already habituated and addicted and have formed habits, then they tell you everything that I told you about Alexa when it first came out, what, six years ago.
[01:21:34.811 --> 01:21:35.692]  And all the other systems.
[01:21:36.857 --> 01:21:49.608]  Hell, I talked about it 20-something years ago before the CIA director at the time came out and said, oh, your toaster and your dishwasher are gonna be watching and listening to you in Wired Magazine.
[01:21:50.949 --> 01:22:03.179]  So the system has such disrespect for you that they live behind walls and they eat non-GMO and they get clean vaccines, but they tell you you can't have a border or a wall.
[01:22:04.909 --> 01:22:09.672]  Then they bring in radical Islam and protect it, but then tell you that Christians are bad.
[01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:15.795]  And then AOC doesn't say a word when Christians are killed or shot, but virtue signals to Muslims.
[01:22:16.395 --> 01:22:23.139]  And then the White House questions that, so she lies and says, oh, I never tweeted about anybody that week, which was all a lie.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.482]  It's just how they get away with this over and over and over.
[01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:30.483]  And I'm asking people, where does it end?
[01:22:31.944 --> 01:22:32.885]  Where is it all going?
[01:22:33.803 --> 01:22:41.745]  What are we going to do when our government is just run by a bunch of criminals, and then we get Trump in who's trying to halfway turn things around and act like he's the devil?
[01:22:43.605 --> 01:22:48.847]  My point is, is that things should be a lot better than they are now, quite frankly.
[01:22:48.887 --> 01:22:53.628]  But people are in a learned helplessness morass.
[01:22:56.589 --> 01:22:58.269]  People watch television all day.
[01:22:58.389 --> 01:23:00.470]  Folks watch Netflix all day.
[01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:01.350]  They watch HBO.
[01:23:02.327 --> 01:23:09.794]  And to them, they are passionate about what's happening in that theater of the mind, not passionate about what's happening in the real world.
[01:23:12.176 --> 01:23:13.357]  I never watch Game of Thrones.
[01:23:13.377 --> 01:23:15.059]  When I say never, I mean, I might watch it.
[01:23:15.419 --> 01:23:16.640]  It's been, what, seven, eight years?
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.100]  I don't know.
[01:23:17.461 --> 01:23:18.642]  Might have watched it ten times.
[01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:26.249]  And my oldest daughter likes to watch it, and my son likes to watch it, and they don't watch a lot of TV, but I let them watch it.
[01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:28.351]  And last night I watched
[01:23:29.485 --> 01:23:36.748]  What they said was the grand finale battle and it had some decent actors in it and it was just non-stop violence.
[01:23:37.988 --> 01:23:46.852]  And when the bad guy gets killed, I've never seen my oldest daughter act this excited and jump around for like three minutes screaming.
[01:23:49.393 --> 01:23:56.336]  I mean, I call it a prosthesis, like a fake limb, when you watch football and when your team wins, you get this tribal feeling of victory.
[01:23:58.086 --> 01:24:08.413]  I mean, I would imagine if you were a firefighter and you got a burning child out of the building and saved him, I would imagine you would feel vitriolic and have endorphin flow.
[01:24:09.114 --> 01:24:14.257]  Or I would imagine if you got a state to pass a law saying we're not going to kill babies in the third trimester.
[01:24:14.397 --> 01:24:15.718]  Or how about after they're born?
[01:24:15.999 --> 01:24:19.601]  You'd feel like you had done something at a spiritual level.
[01:24:20.482 --> 01:24:21.582]  I'm not putting my daughter down.
[01:24:22.283 --> 01:24:26.486]  It was to see passion that I've never seen in her
[01:24:29.952 --> 01:24:36.814]  Since she quit competitive swimming and she was the fastest in the city at her age group, like 11 years old when she quit.
[01:24:38.775 --> 01:24:39.676]  We're in the middle of a divorce.
[01:24:40.756 --> 01:24:44.457]  But the point was, I've never seen that excitement.
[01:24:44.537 --> 01:24:46.258]  It was like a real bad guy.
[01:24:48.339 --> 01:24:57.462]  With 80 episodes she's watched, multiple seasons, and this villain that she did all these bad things to people she cared about that don't exist.
[01:24:59.079 --> 01:25:00.961]  And she was in ecstasy.
[01:25:03.243 --> 01:25:11.711]  Meanwhile, that shows, and I'm not saying she's a bad daughter, she's a great daughter, it shows that I've been a bad dad at some levels.
[01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:12.972]  And that we've all been bad.
[01:25:14.353 --> 01:25:17.456]  That our children are passionate about fantasy.
[01:25:19.929 --> 01:25:23.311]  Because somehow we haven't taught them how to be passionate about the real world.
[01:25:23.612 --> 01:25:28.695]  And I get it, you sit down, it's in a dark room, everything's done for you, it's all interesting.
[01:25:29.616 --> 01:25:30.977]  But that world's not real.
[01:25:32.798 --> 01:25:39.943]  There isn't some demon of light that can raise the dead, coming with a giant zombie horde to kill us.
[01:25:41.945 --> 01:25:45.007]  The zombie horde is us, watching television, not having a life.
[01:25:46.596 --> 01:25:49.918]  The zombie horde is us getting the vaccines that lower our IQ and drinking the fluoride.
[01:25:51.259 --> 01:25:58.044]  The zombie horde is millions of babies being aborted each year and we don't even care or know we've lost our humanity because we're spectators now.
[01:25:59.765 --> 01:26:01.206]  And that's really what we're talking about here.
[01:26:01.466 --> 01:26:10.613]  You know, we've built the only multimedia standalone operation that's promoting Americana renaissance in the world.
[01:26:11.894 --> 01:26:16.957]  And the enemy fully recognized that in the last three years, and has moved heaven and earth to try to shut us down.
[01:26:18.378 --> 01:26:21.880]  And we still have an important voice, and still have a big effect, only because of you.
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:32.627]  And when I get up here on air, talking to you, who's not an audience, like NFL watchers or Game of Thrones viewers, thinking about judging you, I'm just pointing this out.
[01:26:35.666 --> 01:26:36.728]  I'm thanking the audience.
[01:26:37.288 --> 01:26:38.570]  You are in the real world.
[01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:39.632]  You're in the real game.
[01:26:39.712 --> 01:26:50.648]  You're watching and involved and spreading the word and giving us intel and financially backing us and praying for us, spiritually backing us, at a level that nobody else is.
[01:26:50.868 --> 01:26:51.950]  This is the real world.
[01:26:53.237 --> 01:27:03.250]  This is where we first told you about the illegal spying, and told you about the attempt to overthrow Trump, and about killing babies after they're born and keeping their organs years ago, and now it's mainstream news.
[01:27:03.871 --> 01:27:07.215]  The enemy knows that we have the map of humanity.
[01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:08.437]  We have the map of the future.
[01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:13.052]  We have the map and the memory of what humanity was to carry it forward.
[01:27:13.352 --> 01:27:19.676]  So, of course, the good guy is a fellow in a wheelchair in Game of Thrones who has the genetic map and the genetic memory.
[01:27:20.076 --> 01:27:23.619]  Everyone else has lost the genetic memory to carry on humanity's spirit.
[01:27:23.919 --> 01:27:28.982]  And the devil wants to destroy the genetic memory and kill that particular individual.
[01:27:29.282 --> 01:27:33.625]  And so even Game of Thrones is telling you the big game plan and the big secret.
[01:27:34.406 --> 01:27:36.928]  I watched one episode and there were all the archetypes.
[01:27:37.688 --> 01:27:40.650]  And I would say, watch, this lady will walk off and disintegrate into dust.
[01:27:41.171 --> 01:27:42.192]  My son goes, no she won't.
[01:27:42.432 --> 01:27:43.953]  She walks off and disintegrates into dust.
[01:27:44.614 --> 01:27:47.176]  I said, watch, it'll be that girl that kills the bad guy.
[01:27:47.196 --> 01:27:48.276]  It's just 30 minutes in.
[01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:49.537]  My son said, no way.
[01:27:50.218 --> 01:27:51.319]  It'll be a dragon that kills him.
[01:27:52.259 --> 01:27:54.902]  I knew the whole show, even though I've never even really watched it.
[01:27:55.942 --> 01:27:58.204]  The eight or nine times before out of one side of my eye.
[01:27:59.045 --> 01:28:01.567]  Because I already know what the enemy knows.
[01:28:02.107 --> 01:28:06.631]  And the enemy can't help but tell you what they're doing and everything they do, because God has one rule.
[01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:10.419]  The enemy can have control of the air, the broadcast.
[01:28:10.439 --> 01:28:11.800]  The enemy can have control of this planet.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:18.124]  But the enemy must tell you in riddle what the enemy's doing to you.
[01:28:18.805 --> 01:28:25.389]  And they don't want you to have the memory of the race or the consciousness and the current position and the future destiny.
[01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:28.131]  We have the destiny.
[01:28:28.932 --> 01:28:31.153]  We are not sitting here in a wheelchair.
[01:28:32.194 --> 01:28:33.415]  And I'm not putting you down if you are in one.
[01:28:34.656 --> 01:28:36.177]  We know the enemy operation.
[01:28:36.237 --> 01:28:38.299]  We can defeat them and they want us destroyed.
[01:28:38.319 --> 01:28:41.922]  So you understand your Game of Thrones analogy is they want to seize this fortress.
[01:28:43.283 --> 01:28:44.324]  They want to tear us apart.
[01:28:44.884 --> 01:28:48.227]  But it will be the little people in the end that decide our fate.
[01:28:48.927 --> 01:28:55.653]  So go to infowarestore.com and get your supplements today because that's how we finance this plus they're amazing.
[01:28:55.853 --> 01:28:57.194]  You're really missing out if you don't get them.
[01:28:57.414 --> 01:28:58.195]  Take action now.
[01:29:04.463 --> 01:29:09.346]  Charlottesville, Virginia is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history.
[01:29:10.306 --> 01:29:11.267]  We know it by heart.
[01:29:12.207 --> 01:29:14.409]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.225]  That all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.
[01:29:20.986 --> 01:29:24.469]  We've heard it so often, it's almost a cliché, but it's who we are.
[01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:27.212]  We haven't always lived up to these ideals.
[01:29:27.832 --> 01:29:31.936]  Jefferson himself didn't, but we have never before walked away from them.
[01:29:32.216 --> 01:29:39.823]  I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.
[01:29:40.962 --> 01:29:49.924]  But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are.
[01:29:50.364 --> 01:29:52.545]  And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.
[01:29:53.245 --> 01:29:58.946]  The core values of this nation are standing in the world, our very democracy.
[01:29:59.726 --> 01:30:02.867]  Everything that is made America, America is at stake.
[01:30:04.219 --> 01:30:08.283]  That's why today I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.
[01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.106]  Folks, America's an idea.
[01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:17.472]  An idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.
[01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:20.435]  It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth.
[01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:23.517]  It guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity.
[01:30:24.498 --> 01:30:26.720]  And gives hate no safe harbor.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:35.686]  It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can achieve if you work at it.
[01:30:36.687 --> 01:30:37.627]  That's what we believe.
[01:30:38.648 --> 01:30:41.050]  And above all else, that's what's at stake in this election.
[01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:44.012]  We can't forget what happened in Charlottesville.
[01:30:45.193 --> 01:30:48.635]  Even more important, we have to remember who we are.
[01:30:49.156 --> 01:30:49.956]  This is America.
[01:30:54.318 --> 01:30:56.039]  I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.821]  This arm would put him away in seconds.
[01:30:57.841 --> 01:30:58.441]  Fight!

[01:31:20.759 --> 01:31:22.180]  I just don't think I can do it, guys.
[01:31:22.668 --> 01:31:25.850]  Owen, Owen, I'm getting sick and tired of your BS during the breaks today.
[01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:27.531]  Been bitching all day off air.
[01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:28.932]  I'm tired of being a damn cuck.

[01:31:34.396 --> 01:31:34.836]  Fix it.
[01:31:35.076 --> 01:31:35.717]  I'm sick of it.
[01:31:37.178 --> 01:31:43.002]  Okay, um, I guess I'll try this, uh, Super Male Vitality.
[01:31:43.022 --> 01:31:44.423]  Alright, I'll give it a try.
[01:31:45.023 --> 01:31:46.484]  Hmm, says two droppers.
[01:31:46.624 --> 01:31:46.944]  Okay.
[01:31:47.625 --> 01:31:49.086]  Super Male Vitality, huh?
[01:31:49.346 --> 01:31:49.866]  I don't know.
[01:31:49.886 --> 01:31:52.128]  I mean, I'm not totally feeling it yet.
[01:31:52.148 --> 01:31:56.030]  Let me try this Alpha Power from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:57.591 --> 01:31:59.713]  Two Alpha Power supplement pills here.
[01:31:59.893 --> 01:32:01.814]  I guess I'll just try this Alpha Power too.
[01:32:01.874 --> 01:32:02.614]  Maybe this will help.
[01:32:03.675 --> 01:32:04.516]  Alpha Power, huh?
[01:32:04.536 --> 01:32:06.077]  I think I'm starting to feel something.
[01:32:06.197 --> 01:32:11.000]  But this Super Male Vitality Alpha Power combo, I think it's starting to kick in!
[01:32:14.582 --> 01:32:15.142]  Yes!
[01:32:15.983 --> 01:32:28.808]  Yes, I feel the power now!
[01:32:29.168 --> 01:32:29.808]  That's right!

[01:33:05.863 --> 01:33:08.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:37.833 --> 01:33:42.636]  We're going to go to your phone calls on the open borders, on the illegal spreading diseases.
[01:33:43.857 --> 01:33:44.937]  But more people should be treated.
[01:33:44.957 --> 01:33:49.220]  You said they're allowed to spread it, and that American citizens and others are blamed for it.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.941]  We'll cover any other issue you want to get into as well.
[01:33:51.981 --> 01:33:53.322]  I'm going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:54.923 --> 01:33:56.304]  But hey, did you see the news?
[01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:57.985]  For TV viewers, we'll put it up on screen.
[01:33:58.505 --> 01:34:05.089]  Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue features a Muslim woman in a burkini.
[01:34:06.465 --> 01:34:06.985]  That's right.
[01:34:07.506 --> 01:34:18.633]  First it shows her in a hijab and clothes down to her ankles, and then it features her in a rainbow-colored swimsuit, a burkini.
[01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:26.678]  And it's just how beautiful this is, and how wonderful this is, and how it's the greatest style, the burkini.
[01:34:27.359 --> 01:34:31.742]  Because if she doesn't wear that in an Islamic country, they'll cut her head off.
[01:34:32.918 --> 01:34:34.038]  Or throw her off a building.
[01:34:34.899 --> 01:34:40.920]  And so you've got Sports Illustrated not praising women in Iran taking their burqas off and driving cars and saying, we have rights.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:41.940]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.181]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:43.781 --> 01:34:50.642]  Now you praise women going under the Islamic knife and having their genitals cut off.
[01:34:51.162 --> 01:34:52.683]  And here's some of the other news.
[01:34:53.603 --> 01:34:58.084]  French imam tells Muslims not to donate money to rebuild Notre Dame.
[01:34:58.204 --> 01:35:01.085]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article up on
[01:35:03.772 --> 01:35:09.837]  Infowars.com, and no one's going to see it unless you get it out to them.
[01:35:10.878 --> 01:35:18.204]  An imam in France, that's on national television, told Muslims not to donate to the rebuilding of Notre Dame, asking those who do, you have no shame?
[01:35:18.945 --> 01:35:24.989]  During the lecture, the imam asserted that only Christians should donate to the cause because it's a symbol of their religion and not the symbol of Muslims.
[01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:33.674]  He went on to complain that the words would be twisted to openly discourage Muslims from donating to rebuild anyways.
[01:35:34.474 --> 01:35:36.476]  And then it goes on from there.
[01:35:36.976 --> 01:35:39.918]  Swedish artist, jail term extended, after he
[01:35:41.516 --> 01:35:45.377]  Committed, quote, hate crime of saying Muslim migrants have not integrated.
[01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:49.238]  You cannot say anything but praise in Germany or Sweden or you are arrested.
[01:35:49.278 --> 01:35:51.019]  Wow, what a free country.
[01:35:51.059 --> 01:36:01.542]  A Swedish artist's jail term was extended after he commented that hate crime of saying that Muslim migrants do not integrate and that rape culture is a massive problem in the Middle Eastern country.
[01:36:01.562 --> 01:36:10.645]  Street artist, provocateur Dan Park, already arrested for his speech, was originally jailed for three months after he tweeted that rape culture is fundamental and okay among
[01:36:11.525 --> 01:36:12.266]  M-E-N-A.
[01:36:12.326 --> 01:36:13.607]  Middle East and North African people.
[01:36:13.647 --> 01:36:14.288]  That's a fact.
[01:36:14.808 --> 01:36:19.753]  Park was also in prison for race hatred because he referred to Muslim migrants as bladder.
[01:36:20.494 --> 01:36:20.974]  According to
[01:36:22.116 --> 01:36:35.842]  Wictionary, bladder, means a person living in northern European country who is typically of Middle Eastern or North African descent, a wannabe gangster or immigrant who is not well integrated, which most of them, 80% don't work.
[01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:37.983]  They just stand around in leisure suits all day.
[01:36:38.944 --> 01:36:46.647]  An appeals court in Malmo ruled against the previous district court ruling, which found him innocent of two of the seven charges.
[01:36:46.728 --> 01:36:48.728]  So, I have dozens of these articles a day.
[01:36:48.768 --> 01:36:49.129]  Here's one.
[01:36:50.389 --> 01:37:00.472]  No, no, it's only leftist media that says the end of whiteness and whites shouldn't read.
[01:37:01.332 --> 01:37:06.274]  If you tell Africans they shouldn't have, on average, five kids, that's not allowed.
[01:37:06.334 --> 01:37:06.974]  You don't do that.
[01:37:07.874 --> 01:37:15.180]  Renowned commerce says policy should prevent crime, migrant deaths, and climate change, if you believe all of that.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.903]  The point is it's his right to say it, but he's facing jail time.
[01:37:18.503 --> 01:37:24.068]  Macron vows to tackle political Islam in Act 2 of presidency after he's destroyed France completely.
[01:37:24.368 --> 01:37:24.888]  What a joke.
[01:37:25.169 --> 01:37:26.229]  Talk about a stalling tactic.
[01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:33.535]  Saudi's Savagery Kingdom beheads 16-year-old for sending WhatsApp app message.
[01:37:33.596 --> 01:37:34.797]  That's right, beheading people.
[01:37:34.837 --> 01:37:35.817]  Bring lots of those folks in.
[01:37:36.738 --> 01:37:42.460]  Germany, Muslim migrants say it's 100% a woman's fault if she's raped while wearing a short skirt.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:49.622]  Another Paul Joseph Watson article up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com and his great site that is, what is it?
[01:37:49.682 --> 01:37:50.522]  Summit.news.
[01:37:50.562 --> 01:37:51.102]  It's excellent.
[01:37:51.502 --> 01:37:52.763]  I like the redesign he did.
[01:37:52.823 --> 01:37:54.943]  I'm going to redesign ours like his site.
[01:37:55.364 --> 01:37:56.524]  That's Summit.news.
[01:37:57.284 --> 01:38:03.446]  Father gagged, found guilty of family violence for calling his trans daughter of the states taken.
[01:38:05.419 --> 01:38:07.102]  A she.
[01:38:07.362 --> 01:38:11.648]  She takes steroid shots but does not have genitals of a male.
[01:38:12.409 --> 01:38:14.592]  And it's called family violence to do that now.
[01:38:15.534 --> 01:38:19.479]  But the judge in Doublethink said, you still have free speech in Canada, you just can't say this.
[01:38:20.691 --> 01:38:27.135]  The body of a crucified criminal was put on display in Saudi Arabia following 37 executions.
[01:38:27.195 --> 01:38:29.477]  We've got some of those photos for TV viewers.
[01:38:30.498 --> 01:38:35.081]  Viewer discretion advised of these people being hung up by
[01:38:36.775 --> 01:38:39.377]  Their legs upside down, crucified.
[01:38:40.078 --> 01:38:41.079]  That's just some of it.
[01:38:41.439 --> 01:38:47.485]  But now, a lot of the liberals are coming out like Cher and others.
[01:38:48.285 --> 01:38:55.091]  Johnny Rotten's not really a liberal, but in saying that the homeless are all over the place, pooping all over the ground, ruining fancy areas of Los Angeles.
[01:38:55.112 --> 01:38:57.073]  Well, get used to it.
[01:38:57.694 --> 01:38:59.315]  That's the way it goes.
[01:39:01.297 --> 01:39:03.899]  That's the new system that everybody's supposed to put up with.
[01:39:03.919 --> 01:39:08.663]  But there's some folks being hung by their necks and hung by their feet and crucified.
[01:39:09.323 --> 01:39:10.724]  You can look that up if you'd like to.
[01:39:10.764 --> 01:39:11.865]  But hey, it's the religion of peace.
[01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:14.767]  Time to submit to it, right?
[01:39:14.888 --> 01:39:16.949]  Or we'll all be put to the sword.
[01:39:17.009 --> 01:39:24.275]  OK, we're going to go to Jeff and Joe and Zach and Josh and Laura and Greg and James and Philip and Josh and Jaron.
[01:39:26.737 --> 01:39:29.239]  Here in just a moment, I just want to briefly remind listeners
[01:39:30.529 --> 01:39:37.555]  That just like our information is really game-changing and powerful, any products we bring you are game-changing and powerful.
[01:39:38.996 --> 01:39:43.039]  And we were getting deep-earth crystals the last five years.
[01:39:43.079 --> 01:39:49.224]  Before that, we were getting very clean seaweed-derived iodine that you could call atomic, but it was still partially bound.
[01:39:49.264 --> 01:39:50.765]  It was only like 99% pure.
[01:39:51.146 --> 01:39:55.189]  That sounds good, but then you don't get full absorption when it's bound.
[01:39:56.354 --> 01:40:01.135]  Then we couldn't get it for about a year, because we were put over a barrel by the deep earth mining companies.
[01:40:02.216 --> 01:40:05.636]  But then in my search, I found another deep earth crystal source that was just as good.
[01:40:05.696 --> 01:40:15.059]  But they said, listen, you should add the other two types of iodine, because some people can't absorb pure iodine, even though most people can't absorb the non-pure, but we find better absorption rates.
[01:40:15.079 --> 01:40:15.979]  So I put out X3.
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:18.900]  It's just as good as X2.
[01:40:21.112 --> 01:40:24.878]  In fact, I think it's probably better for children and the elderly and others.
[01:40:24.898 --> 01:40:27.942]  Whatever you do, consult your physicians, because iodine's a big deal.
[01:40:28.002 --> 01:40:29.344]  This is the only clean iodine out there.
[01:40:30.105 --> 01:40:31.367]  Well, I want you to experience X3.
[01:40:31.387 --> 01:40:33.310]  That's why I'm offering you a free bottle of it.
[01:40:34.311 --> 01:40:35.993]  When you get a bottle of X2 original,
[01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:39.731]  For 25% off.
[01:40:39.771 --> 01:40:42.873]  So $29.95, you get a bottle of X2 and a free bottle of Survival Shield.
[01:40:42.893 --> 01:40:44.694]  Now, both have thousands of 5-star reviews.
[01:40:45.094 --> 01:40:48.176]  There's no reviews yet because this is a new combo we just launched this weekend.
[01:40:48.196 --> 01:40:49.117]  It's only going to run for a week.
[01:40:49.517 --> 01:40:50.518]  But go to X2.
[01:40:50.558 --> 01:40:51.398]  Show people the reviews there.
[01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:54.340]  6,000 plus 5-star reviews.
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.201]  98% or is it 99% reviews.
[01:40:56.821 --> 01:40:59.063]  It is really absolutely unprecedented.
[01:40:59.123 --> 01:41:03.826]  And the bad halogens are fluoride and chlorine and bromide and all the stuff that is in the body.
[01:41:04.619 --> 01:41:07.941]  And if your body doesn't have good, clean iodine, it will absorb those bad ones.
[01:41:08.001 --> 01:41:19.009]  But if you go to InfowarStore.com and just click on the original X2 by itself, you can see the 6,000 plus reviews, 4.9 stars, 98%.
[01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:29.876]  And folks, let me just read to you some of these five-star reviews from third-party sites like Powered Reviews.
[01:41:31.263 --> 01:41:31.583]  Wow!
[01:41:32.063 --> 01:41:33.564]  We are so excited with this one.
[01:41:33.624 --> 01:41:36.926]  It is such a vigorous, life-affirming taste.
[01:41:37.506 --> 01:41:39.967]  We always buy this as soon as we run out.
[01:41:41.067 --> 01:41:44.989]  That's, uh... Wrongfully Accused Hippies, Maryland.
[01:41:45.509 --> 01:41:45.970]  Five stars.
[01:41:46.610 --> 01:41:47.590]  This is just an order they come in.
[01:41:47.630 --> 01:41:48.351]  We just randomly print them.
[01:41:50.292 --> 01:41:53.833]  This is, uh, definitely going to get this refill when my first bottle runs out.
[01:41:53.913 --> 01:41:54.413]  Good stuff.
[01:41:54.974 --> 01:41:55.354]  Jacob.
[01:41:57.015 --> 01:41:57.555]  Five stars.
[01:41:57.615 --> 01:42:00.036]  Great value on a very strong and powerful product.
[01:42:01.775 --> 01:42:02.075]  Michael.
[01:42:04.217 --> 01:42:10.624]  I don't know what it is about this product and others for InfoWars, but I feel more clear-headed and my body seems to operate more efficiently.
[01:42:11.104 --> 01:42:11.925]  TJ in New York.
[01:42:13.606 --> 01:42:15.428]  In the morning, tastes pretty good.
[01:42:15.448 --> 01:42:17.991]  Yeah, it's not about the taste, but it is a weird taste.
[01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:20.313]  It's an iodine taste, but a pure iodine.
[01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:22.155]  That's Ricardo New Bedford.
[01:42:22.815 --> 01:42:23.896]  Start my day quick.
[01:42:24.517 --> 01:42:24.917]  Johnny P.
[01:42:26.155 --> 01:42:26.936]  These are the reviews.
[01:42:42.336 --> 01:42:44.237]  Why has America been so special compared to other nations?
[01:43:07.657 --> 01:43:10.381]  Why has it become the model of other successful countries?
[01:43:10.701 --> 01:43:12.163]  Why do so many people want to get here?
[01:43:12.924 --> 01:43:17.850]  Because of our constitutional republic and the basic freedoms that were protected for the individual.
[01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:24.672]  Even though we've had a lot of problems, the fact that we were the freest country in the world allowed incredible wealth to be developed.
[01:43:25.352 --> 01:43:27.072]  By the 1950s, the U.S.
[01:43:27.112 --> 01:43:32.654]  had over 80% of the world's patents and over half the wealth, and the biggest middle class the planet had ever seen.
[01:43:33.414 --> 01:43:37.375]  It was America that led the way on human rights, not just here, but around the world.
[01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:43.678]  But if you tune into the national news today, like CNN, you'd believe America was the worst place on Earth.
[01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:45.039]  That it's a horrible place.
[01:43:45.499 --> 01:43:45.979]  And why is that?
[01:43:45.999 --> 01:43:53.385]  It's because multinational corporations, working with the Communist Chinese, the EU and others, are demoralizing the nation to break us down.
[01:43:53.925 --> 01:43:57.708]  And to make us not care about our identity, so we can be absorbed into globalism.
[01:43:58.408 --> 01:44:06.814]  But thanks to InfoWars and thanks to the audience of activists out there, we have rebooted Americana and the resistance against the globalists.
[01:44:07.234 --> 01:44:11.256]  And now Trump coming in and turning the tide, exposing the whole fake Russiagate.
[01:44:11.617 --> 01:44:12.277]  Has them panicked.
[01:44:12.978 --> 01:44:17.761]  Nationalist populists are being elected in South America, in Europe, in the UK.
[01:44:18.101 --> 01:44:19.242]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:44:19.602 --> 01:44:20.983]  And the power structure is panicking.
[01:44:21.792 --> 01:44:36.540]  That's why Big Tech, allied with the Chi-Coms, the authoritarian EU and others, are forcing the whole Hollywood, hate America, brainwashing on the public and bringing in censorship in an attempt to block us from completing the take back of the nation.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.841]  And that's why, more than ever, you have to remember.
[01:44:39.261 --> 01:44:52.766]  Because of the censorship, you've got to come to NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com to hear what's really happening on the front lines and how you can help, not just save the country, but really the future destiny of the people of this planet.
[01:44:53.246 --> 01:45:02.449]  Because if the United States falls to tyranny and falls to leftist authoritarianism, the Communist Chinese will be the dominant cultural force on the planet.
[01:45:03.496 --> 01:45:18.378]  That's why it's so critical that we understand that Democrats in Congress right now are attempting to bring in more draconian censorship of conservatives and others, while at the same time big tech heads lie to Congress and say they're not censoring when they've been caught red-handed.
[01:45:19.372 --> 01:45:24.734]  This is the legislative branch, and we need to take control of it to restore the republic.
[01:45:25.014 --> 01:45:31.296]  We also have to take control of the judicial, and that takes us to our next spot, the Supreme Court.
[01:45:31.436 --> 01:45:34.357]  Imagine what would have happened if Hillary Clinton would have been elected.
[01:45:34.837 --> 01:45:44.640]  It would have been a death blow to this country, because the Democrats now officially say they want to repeal the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so many other issues.
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:47.261]  This nation is still held by a threat.
[01:45:48.038 --> 01:45:53.762]  That's why it's so important to understand that the Democrats are the party of extremism, extreme anti-Americanism.
[01:45:54.102 --> 01:46:00.967]  The Republicans were a bunch of blue blood establishment types, but we've had a populist insurrection that has partially taken it over.
[01:46:01.567 --> 01:46:13.175]  Now we've got to take it all the way over, keep Trump in the White House in 2020, and get more governorships and more state houses across this country to reverse the globalist plan to take down our nation.
[01:46:13.195 --> 01:46:15.096]  And that's why InfoWars is so important.
[01:46:15.416 --> 01:46:17.037]  InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:46:18.198 --> 01:46:22.080]  Tomorrow's news today that will only get through to the people if you spread the word.
[01:46:23.181 --> 01:46:26.023]  Just while I've been out here walking today, I probably shook a hundred hands.
[01:46:26.743 --> 01:46:28.885]  And a third of them said, where are you?
[01:46:28.945 --> 01:46:29.805]  We miss you.
[01:46:30.426 --> 01:46:31.666]  We wish you were still on air.
[01:46:32.567 --> 01:46:37.190]  That's because they were habitualized on YouTube and on iTunes and everywhere else to listen to us.
[01:46:38.075 --> 01:46:40.857]  You have to come to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:46:40.897 --> 01:46:46.400]  And I know the regular listeners understand that, but other people kind of just passively watch what pops up on their screen.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.244]  They love the truth, they love liberty, but they're not thinking that there's an internet outside of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[01:46:52.604 --> 01:46:55.165]  That's why you are how we outreach.
[01:46:55.305 --> 01:46:59.628]  You are how we get this information through the sensors to others.
[01:47:00.168 --> 01:47:01.449]  You are the resistance.
[01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:02.570]  So God bless you all.
[01:47:06.815 --> 01:47:09.402]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.652 --> 01:47:21.254]  Broadcasting worldwide, despite globalists trying to shut it down.
[01:47:21.354 --> 01:47:23.795]  We're still here, thanks to you!
[01:47:24.315 --> 01:47:25.596]  And I salute you!
[01:47:25.916 --> 01:47:28.277]  From enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:28.337 --> 01:47:30.718]  That's right, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.858 --> 01:47:34.740]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.142]  I'm your host Alex Jones, from the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:40.083 --> 01:47:43.592]  I'm in God's hands, and God says, I'm in your hands.
[01:47:44.093 --> 01:47:44.935]  You're in my hands.
[01:47:45.597 --> 01:47:48.985]  As Benjamin Franklin said, we're all in this together.
[01:47:49.824 --> 01:47:58.066]  Remember, AOC and Beto and all the rest of them tell us the world ends in 12 years if we don't submit to them.
[01:47:58.846 --> 01:48:00.707]  That's a terrorist ultimatum.
[01:48:01.067 --> 01:48:05.568]  But make no mistake, their god Lucifer does want to destroy this planet and God's plan.
[01:48:05.588 --> 01:48:06.788]  That's what this is all about.
[01:48:07.128 --> 01:48:09.589]  When they say they want to save the planet, they want to destroy the planet.
[01:48:10.169 --> 01:48:14.410]  But now she's out there with Beto saying it's slavery to have any type of borders.
[01:48:15.694 --> 01:48:16.695]  That's right, we're slaves.
[01:48:16.755 --> 01:48:20.017]  Anybody who wants to come in, we gotta pay for their babies, pay for everything.
[01:48:20.518 --> 01:48:22.039]  Cause she's our new master.
[01:48:22.099 --> 01:48:30.445]  She's there telling us, because they know Americans have guilt, they know we have a conscience, that we've gotta submit and be the globalist slaves.
[01:48:31.746 --> 01:48:33.968]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[01:48:34.028 --> 01:48:34.608]  Here she is.
[01:48:35.749 --> 01:48:40.013]  And so, especially in this moment, first of all, I believe in human rights.
[01:48:40.793 --> 01:48:41.374]  I don't care
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:43.942]  Everything's free.
[01:48:44.283 --> 01:48:45.426]  You're right that you're her slave.
[01:48:45.847 --> 01:48:46.388]  I don't care.
[01:48:47.481 --> 01:48:49.382]  I don't care if you're documented.
[01:48:49.762 --> 01:48:51.182]  I don't care if you're undocumented.
[01:48:51.502 --> 01:48:52.622]  I don't care if you're out here.
[01:48:52.642 --> 01:48:54.583]  I don't care if you're in Rikers.
[01:48:55.043 --> 01:48:57.664]  I believe in your fundamental human rights.
[01:48:58.544 --> 01:48:59.504]  Fundamental human rights.
[01:48:59.524 --> 01:49:00.444]  I don't care if you're in Rikers.
[01:49:00.484 --> 01:49:03.985]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:49:04.345 --> 01:49:07.826]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:49:08.206 --> 01:49:11.587]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:49:11.827 --> 01:49:14.208]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:49:15.143 --> 01:49:16.984]  So what they mean is you're our slave.
[01:49:17.044 --> 01:49:19.165]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:49:19.846 --> 01:49:21.907]  Diseases are pouring in, en masse.
[01:49:21.927 --> 01:49:23.428]  They're not even treating the poor illegal aliens.
[01:49:23.448 --> 01:49:27.030]  They're letting them spread it everywhere and then telling us it's our fault, we gotta pay for it.
[01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:30.512]  So we're gonna go to Zach, we're gonna go to Josh, we're gonna go to Laura, we're gonna go to everybody.
[01:49:31.293 --> 01:49:33.734]  Zach, in Denver, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:49:33.754 --> 01:49:34.515]  Thanks for calling today.
[01:49:35.515 --> 01:49:37.256]  Hey Alex, great to be on the air.
[01:49:37.296 --> 01:49:38.157]  First time caller here.
[01:49:38.177 --> 01:49:38.517]  Thank you.
[01:49:38.677 --> 01:49:39.658]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:42.845 --> 01:49:43.105]  Awesome.
[01:49:43.125 --> 01:49:43.726]  Yeah.
[01:49:43.806 --> 01:49:45.588]  So you're talking about vaccines before.
[01:49:46.308 --> 01:49:48.110]  Just wanted to call in and put in my two cents.
[01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:52.854]  I have never been vaccinated before, but I'm 25 right now.
[01:49:55.036 --> 01:50:01.262]  Only needles that have ever been in me where I got stitches twice and had a little bit of numbing, but that was it.
[01:50:01.342 --> 01:50:03.604]  Still refused the tetanus at the time.
[01:50:05.549 --> 01:50:08.030]  But lately, I mean, I'm 25 now.
[01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:09.670]  My whole life has been the same thing.
[01:50:10.091 --> 01:50:12.631]  I got chicken pox when I was in middle school.
[01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:14.132]  I was out of school for a week.
[01:50:14.172 --> 01:50:15.352]  There's no problem there.
[01:50:15.953 --> 01:50:26.036]  But as of about probably six months ago or so, it's been this whole measles outbreak that the media really has taken and run with.
[01:50:26.496 --> 01:50:32.038]  And then now, every time I come home or see something like that on Drudge,
[01:50:34.081 --> 01:50:42.165]  Oh, that's exactly what it is.
[01:50:42.185 --> 01:50:45.586]  Well, hey, sweetheart, if you're vaccinated, Cupcake, you're protected.
[01:50:46.307 --> 01:50:50.009]  And so did you watch yesterday's show or did you watch the Saturday emergency report?
[01:50:50.609 --> 01:50:52.630]  Because people are sending those reports out.
[01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:56.072]  Can we pull up Saturday's report and also pull up yesterday's two-hour show?
[01:50:56.652 --> 01:50:57.372]  But I did a 44-minute report.
[01:50:59.173 --> 01:51:09.117]  Saturday, where I showed the CDC's own admissions that these vaccines don't protect you in most cases, that there's new strains that they totally don't protect you, and that the illegal aliens are bringing it in.
[01:51:09.617 --> 01:51:16.220]  So this claim that, oh, I've been vaccinated but you're still going to make me sick, but I thought your vaccine protected you.
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:20.482]  Why doesn't your fiancé get upset about the illegal aliens being brought in?
[01:51:21.647 --> 01:51:24.029]  Because she only reads the headlines.
[01:51:24.409 --> 01:51:32.194]  She reads the headlines of, hey, measles outbreak, this is how many people are affected, not where it came from, what's happening with it.
[01:51:36.237 --> 01:51:37.698]  It's incredible, my friend.
[01:51:38.499 --> 01:51:39.880]  It's absolutely incredible.
[01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:46.805]  And again, that's why everybody's got to go to Infowars.com and get yesterday's show that we just had on screen.
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:53.283]  Or what's even shorter and even more hard-hitting, and that is Saturday's show.
[01:51:54.683 --> 01:51:56.564]  Saturday was the key show.
[01:51:57.365 --> 01:52:04.228]  The Sunday one was titled... That's Sunday.
[01:52:05.028 --> 01:52:06.189]  Just, it doesn't matter.
[01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.649]  Just stop.
[01:52:06.969 --> 01:52:07.370]  It's alright.
[01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.970]  You guys are great.
[01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:12.492]  I don't expect you to pull stuff up in live time, but we're not going to put the wrong thing up.
[01:52:13.653 --> 01:52:14.713]  That's the Sunday show.
[01:52:15.814 --> 01:52:16.694]  And that's the two hours.
[01:52:16.794 --> 01:52:17.695]  And it's hard-hitting, too.
[01:52:19.028 --> 01:52:24.870]  And people can go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com and they can get that and send it to their friends and family.
[01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:25.650]  They get in their faces.
[01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:26.411]  This is a war.
[01:52:27.091 --> 01:52:28.871]  Just send it to all the health department links you can.
[01:52:29.352 --> 01:52:31.032]  Force them to look at the reality.
[01:52:31.052 --> 01:52:31.893]  They know what they're doing.
[01:52:32.713 --> 01:52:34.273]  So let's just do Sunday since you said it.
[01:52:36.834 --> 01:52:41.496]  Now Saturday was titled Exclusive.
[01:52:43.477 --> 01:52:47.058]  The measles outbreak is a giant false flag and a hoax.
[01:52:49.798 --> 01:52:55.003]  CDC admits that every major outbreak of measles has been caused by migrants, i.e.
[01:52:57.266 --> 01:52:58.087]  illegal aliens.
[01:52:59.608 --> 01:53:01.270]  Now that's a very important report.
[01:53:02.739 --> 01:53:08.401]  In the name of the video, on our own servers, exclusive, the measles outbreak is a giant false flag and a hoax.
[01:53:09.161 --> 01:53:10.481]  That's why they want us off air.
[01:53:10.501 --> 01:53:12.162]  They don't want you to share that.
[01:53:12.562 --> 01:53:14.742]  Now that was Saturday's emergency report.
[01:53:15.122 --> 01:53:16.163]  Now we can put Sunday up.
[01:53:16.423 --> 01:53:17.243]  Thanks for finding that, guys.
[01:53:17.263 --> 01:53:19.084]  I don't know how they pull stuff up so quick.
[01:53:20.024 --> 01:53:24.185]  The Sunday report is the full show, but I cover it really in the first 30 minutes.
[01:53:24.585 --> 01:53:27.126]  Biological weapons attacks launched against the U.S.
[01:53:27.146 --> 01:53:28.466]  That's what it is when you open the borders up.
[01:53:28.946 --> 01:53:31.367]  An attempt to take down Trump and collapse our economy.
[01:53:32.884 --> 01:53:36.407]  Now sure, on the Sunday show we probably had a million and a half people tune in conservatively.
[01:53:37.187 --> 01:53:40.770]  But that little video we posted last night of the live show only has 25,000 views.
[01:53:41.791 --> 01:53:42.752]  On YouTube it'd have a million.
[01:53:43.032 --> 01:53:44.013]  That's why they took us off there.
[01:53:44.393 --> 01:53:46.214]  Because people are interested to know what's going on.
[01:53:47.856 --> 01:53:50.277]  But they can't stop you from sharing it.
[01:53:51.238 --> 01:53:55.521]  So I salute you and I thank you, but we need to warn people about what's really happening.
[01:53:55.922 --> 01:53:56.642]  And I lay it all out.
[01:53:56.662 --> 01:53:59.905]  I show the government documents where anything in a vaccine
[01:54:01.084 --> 01:54:02.525]  Especially if it's got protein in it.
[01:54:03.025 --> 01:54:07.088]  Whether it's a virus, or whether it's egg, or whether it's human protein.
[01:54:07.108 --> 01:54:12.292]  Because a lot of these vaccines, the actual pathogen is grown on dead baby parts.
[01:54:13.953 --> 01:54:16.255]  Or on a emulsification of babies.
[01:54:18.377 --> 01:54:20.819]  And then you have an autoimmune response.
[01:54:20.839 --> 01:54:23.781]  Well guess what happens when you've got human tissue in a vaccine?
[01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:29.133]  And now it's mixed with tetanus, or measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis.
[01:54:29.853 --> 01:54:34.156]  Your body doesn't think the pertussis bacteria is just a bacteria.
[01:54:34.276 --> 01:54:35.957]  It thinks human flesh is.
[01:54:37.078 --> 01:54:40.840]  And then you get cancer because your body starts attacking itself.
[01:54:41.281 --> 01:54:42.501]  Or you get an autoimmune disease.
[01:54:42.782 --> 01:54:43.462]  This is 101 science!
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.322]  That's why you can't have a vaccine contaminated.
[01:54:48.342 --> 01:55:00.753]  That's why the Guardian reports that the elites of the planet, the Chinese Communist leaders, the US leaders, the German leaders, the British leaders, all the major leaders, the Japanese leaders, get, quote, clean vaccines.
[01:55:02.074 --> 01:55:03.175]  They cost up to $1,000 a shot.
[01:55:05.399 --> 01:55:07.701]  Everything's been scanned through electron microscopes.
[01:55:08.062 --> 01:55:09.203]  It's been tested again.
[01:55:09.864 --> 01:55:14.949]  You've got to go into special clean facilities to make sure that the needle is electronic.
[01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:17.151]  I'm not a doctor, but I've read the schemes.
[01:55:17.271 --> 01:55:18.733]  It goes into a clean room.
[01:55:20.339 --> 01:55:20.980]  Gives the shot.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:26.267]  You basically put your body, your ass, up to a membrane that it then injects you through.
[01:55:26.627 --> 01:55:36.080]  Because the needle, if it carries something into your body, and then has a pathogen, a virus, or a bacteria that's been attenuated, your body then has an autoimmune response to it.
[01:55:36.914 --> 01:55:37.834]  It's still dangerous.
[01:55:38.515 --> 01:55:46.898]  Again, if somebody puts a deadly virus or bacteria into you that's been attenuated, that means broken, killed, your body's gonna learn how to beat it.
[01:55:47.458 --> 01:55:52.440]  You may have a horrible autoimmune response and die from it, but still, you didn't die from the pathogen, you died from the response.
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:56:05.965]  If there's egg, or wheat, or anything, or human tissue, or DNA in there, your body then sees whatever it is, a hormone, anything, as an outside enemy.
[01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:09.152]  And it's bye-bye, Bluebird.
[01:56:11.775 --> 01:56:13.537]  Allergies are up tens of thousands of percentage.
[01:56:13.577 --> 01:56:14.158]  Everybody knows it.
[01:56:14.879 --> 01:56:16.020]  Infant mortality's way up.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.502]  Cancer's up multi-thousand percent.
[01:56:19.003 --> 01:56:21.446]  This is all incontrovertible fact.
[01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:27.894]  Now, I said I'd take a bunch of your calls, but I always just get back to this.
[01:56:29.767 --> 01:56:35.169]  Government and corporations want a precedent to put in your body what they want, when they want.
[01:56:35.469 --> 01:56:36.810]  I had a guest on next hour.
[01:56:36.850 --> 01:56:39.751]  It's really powerful info, but I decided to host the fourth hour.
[01:56:42.112 --> 01:56:44.633]  And so I'm going to have that guest on in the fourth hour.
[01:56:45.253 --> 01:56:45.753]  If they can do it.
[01:56:45.873 --> 01:56:46.413]  If not, fine.
[01:56:46.453 --> 01:56:46.693]  Whatever.
[01:56:47.714 --> 01:56:48.674]  But I'm going to continue with your calls.
[01:56:48.714 --> 01:56:49.855]  I promise I'm getting to everybody.
[01:56:50.895 --> 01:56:51.175]  All right?
[01:56:51.195 --> 01:56:53.596]  So we're going to come back and talk to all the other callers on the other side.
[01:56:53.616 --> 01:56:54.376]  I'll try to move quicker.
[01:56:54.396 --> 01:56:58.358]  But you have to understand this one point.
[01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:03.766]  If these idiots are supposedly vaccinated, why are they saying you're gonna make them sick?
[01:57:04.406 --> 01:57:08.807]  It's one more way to be a victim, one more way for people to get leverage over you and bitch at you.
[01:57:10.088 --> 01:57:12.488]  The media teaches people to be losers and whiners.
[01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:13.889]  That's point number one.
[01:57:14.289 --> 01:57:17.150]  You had your damn shot, why the hell ain't you protected then?
[01:57:17.370 --> 01:57:18.670]  Don't blame me, dumbass!
[01:57:19.930 --> 01:57:20.330]  Number two.
[01:57:23.491 --> 01:57:25.552]  Anything in the vaccine
[01:57:26.792 --> 01:57:33.378]  that's delivered to you, you're going to end up having an enlarged response to, and probably an autoimmune response, permanently.
[01:57:35.279 --> 01:57:35.820]  Permanently.
[01:57:37.421 --> 01:57:37.861]  You understand?
[01:57:38.101 --> 01:57:39.963]  And the more you get shots, the worse it gets.
[01:57:40.243 --> 01:57:42.185]  I see the ads on TV all the time about vaccines.
[01:57:42.445 --> 01:57:45.848]  They say, if you've had a reaction to other vaccines, you can't take this.
[01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:49.651]  Hell, we had an employee almost die from it last year!
[01:57:55.819 --> 01:57:56.520]  I'm right up here on the left.
[01:57:57.701 --> 01:58:00.623]  Actually, the road's closed, so you can turn around in the driveway at the bottom of the hill.
[01:58:00.883 --> 01:58:01.504]  Have a good night.
[01:58:04.246 --> 01:58:09.391]  Face-to-face with 16-year-old high school... Go!
[01:58:09.411 --> 01:58:09.991]  Keep going!
[01:58:10.031 --> 01:58:10.212]  Go!
[01:58:11.493 --> 01:58:12.534]  Keep going!
[01:58:37.583 --> 01:58:43.566]  Really, it was just a matter of time before we saw something like this, and I'm really surprised that we haven't seen something worse.
[01:58:47.227 --> 01:58:50.369]  People always ask, what does it mean to make America great again?
[01:59:13.559 --> 01:59:13.879]  You alright?
[01:59:13.979 --> 01:59:15.981]  Man, the car is stuck in the snow, man.
[01:59:16.001 --> 01:59:17.783]  Should I give you a push?
[01:59:17.823 --> 01:59:18.524]  Yeah, please.
[01:59:18.544 --> 01:59:19.705]  I appreciate it.
[01:59:28.052 --> 01:59:29.293]  Alright, look.
[01:59:29.353 --> 01:59:31.035]  Here's what we're going to have to do.
[01:59:31.055 --> 01:59:32.076]  I'm going to push.
[01:59:32.256 --> 01:59:33.237]  Don't hit the brakes at all.
[01:59:33.337 --> 01:59:34.478]  You just got to keep going.
[01:59:46.753 --> 01:59:50.314]  It means to make America a better place than it was the day before.
[01:59:54.716 --> 02:00:00.598]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.590 --> 02:00:20.578]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:21.399 --> 02:00:27.744]  You know, I don't care if you're Muslim, I don't care if you're Christian, I don't care if you're agnostic or you're an animist.
[02:00:28.905 --> 02:00:33.509]  The vaccines are a Trojan horse to put in your body what the establishment wants.
[02:00:33.529 --> 02:00:38.954]  With a long history of secret testing and the rest of it, people are crazy just buying into this garbage.
[02:00:39.892 --> 02:00:41.172]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:41.192 --> 02:00:42.553]  Everybody holding?
[02:00:43.513 --> 02:00:44.413]  Who's up next here?
[02:00:45.393 --> 02:00:47.193]  Josh in Michigan, then Laura in Texas.
[02:00:47.253 --> 02:00:48.554]  Josh, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:49.834 --> 02:00:51.774]  Hey Alex, good to talk with you.
[02:00:52.474 --> 02:00:56.735]  I've been a longtime listener and I wake up every morning and I thank God that I'm aware.
[02:00:57.275 --> 02:01:01.556]  But I also want to thank you because you woke me up to a lot of things that have gone on.
[02:01:02.136 --> 02:01:06.097]  Just in my short lifetime, I'm 41 years old in southern Michigan and
[02:01:06.710 --> 02:01:15.398]  What I've seen, and I'm going to take a little bit different of a take on this whole border issue, is the amount of acceptance that the media crams down our throats.
[02:01:15.438 --> 02:01:17.700]  You know, it was back in, what, the 70s?
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:19.682]  They wanted us to accept abortion.
[02:01:20.683 --> 02:01:28.930]  You know, now then they want us... How many presidential speeches did Obama do where we had to accept Islam, where they want to kill Christians?
[02:01:29.331 --> 02:01:31.012]  That's what their calling is to do.
[02:01:31.052 --> 02:01:32.794]  And now it's let's kill babies after they're born.
[02:01:33.624 --> 02:01:36.826]  Well, yeah, to go back to the abortion issue.
[02:01:37.666 --> 02:01:41.108]  My whole thing is, why has the church become so weak?
[02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:44.390]  I'll tell you why, brother.
[02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:45.391]  We've had it so good.
[02:01:45.491 --> 02:01:46.932]  Freedom created so much wealth.
[02:01:47.352 --> 02:01:48.093]  People are lazy.
[02:01:48.133 --> 02:01:49.613]  And I'm not calling for everybody to be killed.
[02:01:49.714 --> 02:01:50.274]  It's the opposite.
[02:01:50.294 --> 02:01:56.938]  But what if people start killing pro-post-birth abortion politicians and calling it a post-birth abortion?
[02:01:59.639 --> 02:02:00.440]  Say that again, I'm sorry.
[02:02:00.799 --> 02:02:04.662]  What's going to happen if people start killing these pro-post-birth abortion politicians?
[02:02:05.142 --> 02:02:06.843]  These politicians that support killing babies after they're born.
[02:02:07.123 --> 02:02:11.126]  What's going to happen when somebody goes and kills them and says, hey, this is just a post-birth abortion?
[02:02:11.746 --> 02:02:12.787]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:12.827 --> 02:02:15.709]  You know, I was talking to my brother-in-law, Misha, about where can we attend?
[02:02:15.969 --> 02:02:18.070]  Where can we find a pastor that's going to stand?
[02:02:18.651 --> 02:02:29.458]  You know, if most of this country claims that they're Christians and then, you know, and the globalists want to infiltrate this country with Islam to destroy us, everything that they've done through the media and through television is to destroy us.
[02:02:30.373 --> 02:02:30.853]  Exactly!
[02:02:31.033 --> 02:02:48.204]  Everything Hollywood does is to put you in a false reality and then sap your essence and make you weak and make you go along and then by success of approximation people are so scared of some liberal group boycotting and we all roll over and then it's more more more until now we let convicted pedophiles
[02:02:49.625 --> 02:02:57.250]  Have access to elementary school students all over the United States and Europe to teach them about sex and parents let them do it to show how open they are.
[02:02:57.530 --> 02:03:02.474]  We are a white flag society and running the white flag up must stop now.
[02:03:02.814 --> 02:03:04.755]  InfoWars, my friend, is not running it up.
[02:03:05.096 --> 02:03:06.016]  And that's why we're under attack.
[02:03:06.036 --> 02:03:06.456]  But you know what?
[02:03:06.517 --> 02:03:10.900]  It's an honor to be under attack because it's made us even stronger with key people.
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:16.864]  We don't have as big an audience as we used to have, but we have an audience of the thinkers now and we've gone to the next level thanks to you.
[02:03:17.104 --> 02:03:18.685]  Where do you think all this is going, Josh?
[02:03:19.392 --> 02:03:20.773]  Well, I want to say two things to that.
[02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:28.498]  Where I think it's all going is Satan is going to continue to try to destroy the human race, which we are the Bride of Christ.
[02:03:28.538 --> 02:03:30.580]  But I want to go back and touch on something you said.
[02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:33.362]  You think you don't have as big of an audience as you think?
[02:03:34.402 --> 02:03:40.707]  I say your listeners are finding more secretive ways to hear you without exposing it to the globalists so that they can't shut you down.
[02:03:41.354 --> 02:03:47.317]  Well brother, brother, brother, brother, I know that word of mouth we're bigger than ever and I know that in a way we are stronger than ever, but I'm going to be honest.
[02:03:47.837 --> 02:03:52.099]  I get mobbed everywhere I go saying, why can't I hear you anymore?
[02:03:52.159 --> 02:03:53.179]  I wish you were still on air.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:59.402]  They don't see me on YouTube or a hundred other platforms anymore and then they think, oh Alex Jones is off air because the media says.
[02:03:59.822 --> 02:04:02.804]  Yes, we have more listeners than ever and viewers at InfoWars.
[02:04:03.504 --> 02:04:09.306]  But it's still not as big as it was, and people literally, everywhere I go, aren't, I guess, as dialed in as you.
[02:04:09.566 --> 02:04:11.067]  They're not dumb, they're just not conscious.
[02:04:11.647 --> 02:04:13.048]  So they don't know that we're still on air.
[02:04:13.068 --> 02:04:14.188]  That's why you've got to tell people.
[02:04:14.708 --> 02:04:16.529]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:04:16.809 --> 02:04:19.870]  You have to reach out and tell folks about the local AM and FM stations.
[02:04:20.130 --> 02:04:24.452]  And I know you're doing it, but folks, when something's forbidden, people really want to hear it.
[02:04:24.752 --> 02:04:26.853]  But if they don't know it's forbidden, they won't tune in.
[02:04:26.873 --> 02:04:27.413]  Does that make sense?
[02:04:28.382 --> 02:04:39.708]  It makes perfect sense, but I want to let you know that me, my father Bruce, my brother-in-law Misha, we are pounding the pavement getting people to listen to you so that they can, you know, going back to the vaccination thing, spreading the word, you know, vaccinations.
[02:04:39.768 --> 02:04:44.270]  I've got personal experience where a vaccination caused permanent brain damage, permanent nerve damage.
[02:04:44.290 --> 02:04:45.291]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:04:45.871 --> 02:04:46.372]  Absolutely.
[02:04:46.832 --> 02:04:50.695]  I've got, like, five members of my family who've got their feet went numb for a while.
[02:04:50.715 --> 02:04:52.356]  One of them couldn't breathe and he put in the hospital.
[02:04:52.616 --> 02:04:54.418]  I want to hear your story when we come back, Josh.
[02:04:54.898 --> 02:04:55.739]  Well, stay with us, everybody.
[02:04:55.759 --> 02:04:57.040]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:58.481]  Newswars.com.
[02:05:07.578 --> 02:05:11.480]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:13.741]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:14.561]  Good to talk to you.
[02:05:14.881 --> 02:05:19.063]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:05:19.283 --> 02:05:21.024]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[02:05:21.124 --> 02:05:25.505]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:05:25.726 --> 02:05:32.048]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[02:05:32.148 --> 02:05:33.609]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:34.189]  Tell us about it.
[02:05:34.209 --> 02:05:34.909]  Well, it's really great.
[02:05:34.929 --> 02:05:36.130]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[02:05:36.170 --> 02:05:36.610]  I take it.
[02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:37.290]  It tastes good.
[02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:39.051]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:05:39.111 --> 02:05:40.812]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:05:40.972 --> 02:05:43.433]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[02:05:43.453 --> 02:05:44.254]  So I really like it.
[02:05:44.274 --> 02:05:46.955]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:05:46.995 --> 02:05:48.536]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:05:48.656 --> 02:05:50.537]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:05:50.637 --> 02:05:51.117]  So, yeah.
[02:05:51.497 --> 02:05:53.358]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[02:05:53.818 --> 02:05:56.139]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[02:05:56.499 --> 02:05:57.420]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[02:05:57.580 --> 02:05:59.321]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:19.315 --> 02:06:23.238]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:24.299 --> 02:06:29.023]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:36.089 --> 02:06:38.731]  All right, we're back live.
[02:06:38.751 --> 02:06:40.512]  We're taking your vaccine horror stories.
[02:06:40.552 --> 02:06:45.937]  We're talking about the borders being open, the government admitting it's the illegals spreading all these drug-resistant diseases.
[02:06:47.858 --> 02:06:48.458]  It's incredible.
[02:06:48.478 --> 02:06:49.279]  Where is it all going?
[02:06:49.319 --> 02:06:53.361]  Josh in Michigan, tell folks you said that you had a problem with a vaccine you took.
[02:06:54.121 --> 02:06:54.642]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:06:54.682 --> 02:06:55.882]  It wasn't a vaccine that I took.
[02:06:56.303 --> 02:07:03.907]  It was a family member very close to me that, you know, the school systems force you to take a number of vaccines.
[02:07:05.027 --> 02:07:08.349]  And when you take them, you're then allowed to go to school.
[02:07:08.369 --> 02:07:10.671]  But if you don't, you've got to jump through a bunch of red hoops.
[02:07:10.711 --> 02:07:16.034]  So the gentleman elected to let his daughter take the vaccination, she instantly had brain damage.
[02:07:16.094 --> 02:07:16.634]  And now she
[02:07:17.449 --> 02:07:20.712]  She can kind of operate in an independent way.
[02:07:20.772 --> 02:07:23.314]  She's about 19 years old now.
[02:07:23.354 --> 02:07:24.475]  This happened about a decade ago.
[02:07:24.855 --> 02:07:32.081]  But she has to be fed through a tube because she has permanent nerve damage in her digestive system to where she can't swallow food.
[02:07:32.561 --> 02:07:43.389]  Sir, literally, this is why I don't shy away from vaccine news or abortion news, but I get so mad when I'm researching it that then I do stuff like
[02:07:44.190 --> 02:07:46.072]  You know, punch a hole through a door and break my hand.
[02:07:46.612 --> 02:07:46.892]  Sure.
[02:07:46.952 --> 02:07:50.435]  Because at a biological, physical level, as a male, I'm not doing.
[02:07:50.455 --> 02:07:53.257]  At a physical level, you're just supposed to go after who's ever doing this.
[02:07:54.218 --> 02:07:57.460]  But we can't do that in this modern system because the public isn't ready for that type of leadership.
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:58.561]  It's got to do with an information war.
[02:07:58.721 --> 02:08:03.705]  And that's why people should use information violently and aggressively, getting it out however you can.
[02:08:03.965 --> 02:08:06.947]  This isn't some passive, apologetic way.
[02:08:07.388 --> 02:08:09.650]  I remember 12 years ago.
[02:08:10.475 --> 02:08:13.636]  Thirteen years ago, they were doing Gardasil tests in Texas.
[02:08:14.556 --> 02:08:18.917]  For whatever reason, they tricked Rick Perry, who I don't think is a bad guy overall compared to, like, an Obama.
[02:08:19.197 --> 02:08:20.018]  I know folks that know him well.
[02:08:20.038 --> 02:08:22.818]  He's actually a pretty good guy when it comes to guns and private property.
[02:08:24.379 --> 02:08:33.701]  But he believes in the system so much, and he believes in doctors, he doesn't believe that anything above it could do wrong.
[02:08:34.881 --> 02:08:35.982]  They couldn't get George W.
[02:08:37.987 --> 02:08:42.791]  To make a national emergency declaration, because they can do that, to make a vaccine mandatory.
[02:08:43.351 --> 02:08:45.873]  And by mandatory, they just mean it's recommended by the health departments.
[02:08:46.334 --> 02:08:49.356]  That way it gets around testing and safety studies.
[02:08:49.857 --> 02:08:52.319]  We have bills introduced in Texas to make vaccines have safety studies.
[02:08:52.599 --> 02:08:54.160]  Yeah, folks, you didn't know they don't have safety studies?
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:55.741]  They have liability protection.
[02:08:57.283 --> 02:09:02.207]  And so Perry allowed them, it was Merck was the company, to do studies in Texas.
[02:09:02.327 --> 02:09:03.588]  Well, I started getting calls.
[02:09:04.977 --> 02:09:12.168]  From people's 11-year-old girls that were in the studies who had autoimmune diseases, got red spots all over them, got paralyzed.
[02:09:12.829 --> 02:09:19.639]  And then when the drug came out, it said it was experimental, said it could give you Guillain-Barré or narcolepsy or could sterilize you.
[02:09:20.754 --> 02:09:26.762]  All sorts of polyps coming out in little girls' ovaries, and a lot of these girls had to have hysterectomies, you name it.
[02:09:27.223 --> 02:09:35.875]  And so Japan stopped it, India stopped it, but Perry declaring a health emergency got a state to do it.
[02:09:35.895 --> 02:09:37.638]  You could have the president or a state governor do it.
[02:09:38.098 --> 02:09:40.400]  So that became a mandated vaccine nationwide.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:43.362]  Now, they pulled it back because it killed and hurt so many girls.
[02:09:43.382 --> 02:09:47.785]  But exactly, why would Merck want to do that with something they knew was going to kill people?
[02:09:48.125 --> 02:09:50.947]  It's a test to see what they can get away with.
[02:09:50.967 --> 02:09:51.868]  Let me show you this right here.
[02:09:52.668 --> 02:09:57.071]  This is the Merck insert for the measles, mumps, rubella shot that's currently being given.
[02:09:57.372 --> 02:09:58.573]  Not the fake fact sheet.
[02:09:59.013 --> 02:10:01.094]  They'll always say, oh, go to the pharmacy, get a fact sheet.
[02:10:01.695 --> 02:10:07.239]  This is the Merck actual measles, mumps,
[02:10:08.573 --> 02:10:14.597]  And Rubella documents, zoom in on that baby, it says it can give you type 1 diabetes.
[02:10:15.378 --> 02:10:16.418]  It says it can kill you.
[02:10:16.899 --> 02:10:21.001]  It says it can sterilize you, give you narcolepsy, give you neurological disorders, can kill you.
[02:10:21.222 --> 02:10:22.683]  It can have cancer viruses in it.
[02:10:23.183 --> 02:10:27.886]  Anyone can go to a Walgreens or a CVS or a Walmart and say, hey, I'm thinking about taking the MMR.
[02:10:28.426 --> 02:10:29.507]  I want the insert.
[02:10:29.587 --> 02:10:33.350]  By law, they have to give it to you.
[02:10:33.690 --> 02:10:37.993]  Every ampule that has the vaccine in it comes with these.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:41.081]  Now let me go further, and I'm going to go back to you, sir.
[02:10:41.101 --> 02:10:41.541]  Put him on hold.
[02:10:41.681 --> 02:10:42.241]  This is too important.
[02:10:42.682 --> 02:10:53.587]  We had a woman working here, I'm not giving out her private information, I'm saying her name, who went to Vietnam about two years ago.
[02:10:56.388 --> 02:11:02.692]  And she went to Vietnam, and they told her, you've got to take all these vaccines.
[02:11:03.592 --> 02:11:07.254]  One of the vaccines almost killed her, hospitalized her,
[02:11:10.004 --> 02:11:15.968]  And when she came in two weeks later wearing a mask, they told her your immune system's gone for the next few months.
[02:11:15.988 --> 02:11:16.988]  You have to wear a mask now.
[02:11:17.869 --> 02:11:20.430]  And they said she can never take another vaccine again.
[02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:21.011]  It'll kill her.
[02:11:22.031 --> 02:11:23.893]  Because she had an autoimmune response.
[02:11:23.933 --> 02:11:26.414]  Like, I got stung by bees my whole childhood.
[02:11:26.454 --> 02:11:28.095]  Thought kids that got stung by them were wimps.
[02:11:28.395 --> 02:11:31.717]  We used to fight wasp and yellow jackets with ping pong paddles.
[02:11:34.699 --> 02:11:37.661]  Inside, underneath people's houses and in the bushes.
[02:11:38.201 --> 02:11:39.542]  That's how crazy I was as a kid.
[02:11:40.202 --> 02:11:44.284]  Well, one time I was digging in the garden and about 30 Africanized bees came out of a tree.
[02:11:44.304 --> 02:11:49.707]  My parents had paid me when I was in college to dig up this, they had four acres and till this area so they could plant stuff.
[02:11:50.168 --> 02:11:50.728]  A big garden.
[02:11:50.828 --> 02:11:51.929]  I got hit like a movie.
[02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:54.830]  I run in their house like a cartoon with a black swarm of bees around me.
[02:11:57.912 --> 02:12:01.614]  And I get in there and I have like 12 stingers in my head, maybe 15.
[02:12:02.154 --> 02:12:03.235]  Swell up, almost die.
[02:12:04.426 --> 02:12:07.872]  Again, the first 20 times I got stung never happened.
[02:12:08.392 --> 02:12:12.419]  Now, I stepped on a bee in my backyard two years ago.
[02:12:14.863 --> 02:12:19.289]  All of a sudden, two minutes later, it got swollen up, started getting red, guzzled Benadryl.
[02:12:20.319 --> 02:12:22.920]  Put baking powder on it, and didn't have the full response.
[02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:25.101]  Now, what do you think happens to your baby?
[02:12:25.121 --> 02:12:27.061]  I'm gonna just keep public service announcing this.
[02:12:27.101 --> 02:12:29.022]  I know I said this first hour and last hour.
[02:12:29.222 --> 02:12:30.483]  How are you not supposed to, folks?
[02:12:31.343 --> 02:12:32.243]  It's the same thing.
[02:12:33.063 --> 02:12:37.405]  Why do you think it's the third round that little boys who don't have as strong a blood-brain barrier as little girls?
[02:12:37.865 --> 02:12:40.126]  Any doctor will tell you little girls are twice as tough as little boys.
[02:12:41.366 --> 02:12:42.207]  Not in a fist fight.
[02:12:42.607 --> 02:12:45.648]  Women can handle more gunshot wounds, more starvation.
[02:12:46.068 --> 02:12:47.709]  Women can't, because they gotta have babies, folks.
[02:12:47.729 --> 02:12:48.409]  They gotta be tough.
[02:12:50.063 --> 02:12:52.225]  Women have twice as strong a blood-brain barrier.
[02:12:54.546 --> 02:12:55.007]  You understand?
[02:12:56.688 --> 02:12:58.409]  That's why women don't get autism as much.
[02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:01.291]  It's 90% autism as little boys.
[02:13:01.632 --> 02:13:02.813]  It goes right into their brains.
[02:13:04.074 --> 02:13:08.877]  Any high-performance mammal has a thinner blood-brain barrier and a higher metabolism.
[02:13:09.157 --> 02:13:15.462]  Black people, and it's true, we're all humans, but on average, black people are more athletic, and they have even a thinner blood-brain barrier.
[02:13:15.802 --> 02:13:19.185]  All the studies show aluminum dioxide works for black people than anybody else.
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:21.020]  Fluoride.
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:22.281]  Worse for black people than anybody else.
[02:13:22.301 --> 02:13:22.661]  Look it up.
[02:13:24.041 --> 02:13:25.082]  Especially black males.
[02:13:25.822 --> 02:13:26.922]  Cannot take it.
[02:13:27.882 --> 02:13:29.363]  Who's the next group that can't take it?
[02:13:29.583 --> 02:13:30.083]  White males.
[02:13:30.563 --> 02:13:31.644]  And it goes down the line from there.
[02:13:32.284 --> 02:13:35.825]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of what's going on.
[02:13:36.165 --> 02:13:37.306]  This is the science.
[02:13:37.666 --> 02:13:38.746]  Not the pseudoscience.
[02:13:39.106 --> 02:13:39.946]  The reality.
[02:13:41.807 --> 02:13:45.468]  So you remember that the baby has gotten 45 shots by 18 months.
[02:13:49.429 --> 02:13:58.811]  And at 18 months, they give that baby not 6 or 7 or 8 shots, they give them up to 10 shots at once, and that's when the little boy has the convulsion.
[02:13:59.471 --> 02:14:00.851]  And that's when the little boy dies.
[02:14:02.771 --> 02:14:03.411]  There's a study.
[02:14:03.852 --> 02:14:04.292]  Feds.
[02:14:04.612 --> 02:14:06.232]  Blacks suffer most from fluoride.
[02:14:07.392 --> 02:14:08.192]  Florida, anyways.
[02:14:08.272 --> 02:14:08.872]  Harvard study.
[02:14:10.893 --> 02:14:13.773]  Let me tell you, fluoride will hurt anybody who drinks it.
[02:14:14.894 --> 02:14:17.014]  But if you are from Africa,
[02:14:18.044 --> 02:14:20.665]  You better stay real far away.
[02:14:21.365 --> 02:14:24.326]  Some studies show twice as bad, but that's studying women and men.
[02:14:25.226 --> 02:14:29.868]  The studies in men, four times worse for a black male to ingest fluoride.
[02:14:31.548 --> 02:14:32.388]  Four times worse.
[02:14:32.989 --> 02:14:33.589]  Four times.
[02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:34.689]  Four times.
[02:14:35.249 --> 02:14:37.110]  Four times worse.
[02:14:37.130 --> 02:14:40.251]  You're not going to hear that out of your black leaders, though, because they want you dead in a hammer.
[02:14:40.491 --> 02:14:43.952]  They're hired to kill your ass, all the black supremacist idiots.
[02:14:44.793 --> 02:14:46.674]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in Michigan.
[02:14:46.874 --> 02:14:47.394]  Finish your point.
[02:14:47.434 --> 02:14:48.215]  I'm sorry for running over you.
[02:14:48.235 --> 02:14:48.515]  Go ahead.
[02:14:48.955 --> 02:14:49.795]  No, no, you're fine.
[02:14:49.835 --> 02:15:08.965]  But I think that a lot of what's going on right now is basically a God versus Satan spiritual level war where even when you're talking about the vaccination where more boys are susceptible, well, if we're all made in God's image and Jesus came to earth as a man, wouldn't it be, it's a simple definition of like Satan's trying to destroy
[02:15:09.824 --> 02:15:10.184]  Men.
[02:15:10.365 --> 02:15:12.286]  If you're taking over, you wipe out the men.
[02:15:12.326 --> 02:15:12.487]  That's 101.
[02:15:13.568 --> 02:15:14.008]  Exactly.
[02:15:14.088 --> 02:15:24.358]  And that's shocking to me, going back to my reference of why the churches are kind of weak on all these points where media and globalism is forcing all these.
[02:15:24.838 --> 02:15:28.482]  You know, this country was founded on conservative values and the Ten Commandments.
[02:15:29.022 --> 02:15:30.483]  That's what I was brought up and taught.
[02:15:30.604 --> 02:15:31.985]  And when you look at the laws,
[02:15:33.512 --> 02:15:44.700]  Well, when the state kills a newborn baby, it's not murder, because we didn't count it as alive.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:48.843]  But if we want to keep the baby, we call it resuscitate, and we wave a wand, and we do.
[02:15:49.183 --> 02:15:49.704]  God bless you.
[02:15:49.724 --> 02:15:50.604]  Great points, Josh.
[02:15:50.984 --> 02:15:52.686]  All right, I promise I'm going quicker when we come back.
[02:15:52.806 --> 02:15:58.309]  Laura, Tom, Leonard, Jaron, Paul, Joe, Jeff, everybody, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.790]  Stay with us.
[02:16:02.492 --> 02:16:03.093]  Maybe not.
[02:16:03.654 --> 02:16:12.526]  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight against The Globalist has been like a 12-round boxing match that's got more like 100 rounds.
[02:16:13.447 --> 02:16:15.370]  And I'd say we're in about the 85th round right now.
[02:16:17.355 --> 02:16:20.918]  Now, just today, I'm shooting this report on Friday afternoon.
[02:16:21.778 --> 02:16:31.065]  We've had really serious sabotage and attacks behind the scenes, and I've decided not to give the specifics of it for reasons that I can't disclose at this time.
[02:16:31.146 --> 02:16:39.972]  But the fact that President Trump's getting the country back, the fact that nationalists are getting elected all over the world, the fact that we're now aware of the threat of radical Islam,
[02:16:41.013 --> 02:16:48.980]  The fact that all of this is going on is really making the establishment very, very angry.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:59.949]  It just came out today that Ilhan Omar, the authoritarian Somali that admits she hates America, called up and threatened Jack Dorsey and said, how dare you keep Trump on Twitter?
[02:17:00.369 --> 02:17:04.693]  He criticized me and showed my clips basically praising radical Islam.
[02:17:05.554 --> 02:17:07.796]  And Dorsey explained to her, well, we have free speech in this country.
[02:17:08.513 --> 02:17:21.961]  Well, the truth is, behind the scenes, if you're not President Trump, these types of phone calls and open calls for us to be censored in Congress have had the desired effect of them trying to curtail us and cut us down to nothing.
[02:17:22.321 --> 02:17:25.343]  They're even going after our basic operations center.
[02:17:26.523 --> 02:17:29.525]  They're going after our actual servers, our infrastructure.
[02:17:29.625 --> 02:17:31.406]  But we have redundancy built in.
[02:17:31.947 --> 02:17:37.230]  But that costs a lot of money to have people working overtime to keep our systems in place.
[02:17:38.075 --> 02:17:52.039]  So, in the final equation, if you want to see the globalists defeated, and if you want to see the deep state prosecuted that we're inches away from, if you want to see the tide totally turned, it takes money to prosecute an information war.
[02:17:52.399 --> 02:17:54.139]  We have truth, they have lies.
[02:17:54.739 --> 02:17:58.620]  The truth is more powerful than lies, but they have globalist dirty money.
[02:17:59.081 --> 02:18:00.381]  Fiat Federal Reserve money.
[02:18:01.041 --> 02:18:04.282]  So, I'm launching this weekend, for one week,
[02:18:05.433 --> 02:18:05.973]  New sales.
[02:18:06.033 --> 02:18:08.154]  We're having to end the t-shirt sale 50% off.
[02:18:08.674 --> 02:18:12.455]  We're having to end the sale on a free bottle of Knockout with Brain Force Plus.
[02:18:12.475 --> 02:18:13.516]  That ends in just a couple days.
[02:18:14.976 --> 02:18:18.097]  But we're launching two new super specials right now.
[02:18:18.357 --> 02:18:19.458]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[02:18:20.396 --> 02:18:37.263]  Which is the ultimate bone broth, strongest bone broth formula with chaga mushroom, with concentrated turmeric, with all sorts of other key ingredients known to fight inflammation, known to be antioxidants, known to be good for your joints, your bones, your eyes, everything.
[02:18:37.563 --> 02:18:40.404]  And then organic, concentrated chicken broth.
[02:18:40.424 --> 02:18:45.226]  Everybody knows that, you know, when you got the flu or whatever, that chicken broth, for whatever reason, has that essence that's good.
[02:18:45.527 --> 02:18:45.867]  This is
[02:18:46.647 --> 02:18:51.692]  Like dozens and dozens of bowls of chicken broth, each serving without all the calories.
[02:18:52.313 --> 02:18:53.714]  Bone broth is amazing.
[02:18:53.934 --> 02:18:56.096]  Everybody knows its attributes for thousands of years.
[02:18:56.437 --> 02:18:57.498]  It's the hottest item out there.
[02:18:58.502 --> 02:19:05.987]  We went out a few years ago and looked at all the top-selling, best-rated brands and said, let's make it even stronger and even better for a low price.
[02:19:06.007 --> 02:19:09.290]  Because most places mark them up five, six, seven times.
[02:19:09.710 --> 02:19:10.291]  We mark it up 150%.
[02:19:10.351 --> 02:19:14.253]  When we have a discount, we only mark it up 100%.
[02:19:15.034 --> 02:19:19.457]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is only marked up about 65% right now.
[02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:24.241]  You can get ultimate bone broth formula, which is low in stock.
[02:19:24.901 --> 02:19:28.925]  For only $19.95 at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:29.445 --> 02:19:30.767]  Experience it for yourself.
[02:19:30.867 --> 02:19:31.607]  It tastes okay.
[02:19:31.928 --> 02:19:37.273]  But if you mix it in with whey, if you mix it in with some fruit, if you mix it in with some milk and things, it tastes great.
[02:19:37.773 --> 02:19:38.434]  Drink it down.
[02:19:38.674 --> 02:19:40.636]  Great post-workout.
[02:19:41.277 --> 02:19:42.418]  Great meal replacement.
[02:19:42.778 --> 02:19:43.599]  This is really it.
[02:19:43.999 --> 02:19:45.541]  Ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:19:46.461 --> 02:19:50.605]  50% off the already discounted price at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:50.826 --> 02:20:00.675]  We've got another special there as well that I don't have time to tell you about, but while you're on the site, look for the Buy Survival Shield X2 and get X3 absolutely free.
[02:20:00.975 --> 02:20:01.936]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:08.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:26.954 --> 02:20:34.421]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:20:35.443 --> 02:20:39.346]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:39.787 --> 02:20:43.591]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:20:43.971 --> 02:20:45.653]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:46.333 --> 02:20:48.475]  I want to be clear to infinity.
[02:20:48.676 --> 02:20:50.858]  I want to be one trillion percent clear and beyond.
[02:20:52.972 --> 02:20:57.714]  When I got calls 20 years ago to be in major movies with major roles, I thought it was pretty cool.
[02:20:59.274 --> 02:21:00.555]  But I never worshipped Hollywood.
[02:21:01.875 --> 02:21:05.396]  Then I went out to Hollywood and I found out that Hollywood was trying to co-op me.
[02:21:05.996 --> 02:21:08.517]  They were point-blank about it, to join their operation.
[02:21:09.678 --> 02:21:10.178]  I said no.
[02:21:11.398 --> 02:21:13.579]  And I said no to all the other offers, but I want to explain something.
[02:21:14.676 --> 02:21:21.741]  Where I'm at now, it's not just it was easy to turn down the offers like it was 15 years ago, 18 years ago.
[02:21:22.622 --> 02:21:30.327]  You couldn't put guns to my head, or even my family, because their souls are going to be free, and make me serve this system.
[02:21:30.907 --> 02:21:35.110]  It's not like, oh, we're champions for saying no to the New World Order, or we're good guys.
[02:21:35.511 --> 02:21:36.671]  We're just not crazy.
[02:21:37.572 --> 02:21:39.194]  You think I want to spend eternity?
[02:21:39.514 --> 02:21:40.655]  By the way, our souls are eternal.
[02:21:40.675 --> 02:21:41.295]  It's been proven.
[02:21:41.515 --> 02:21:42.356]  The globalists all know it.
[02:21:42.656 --> 02:21:45.179]  They want us chained up with their evil asses forever.
[02:21:45.779 --> 02:21:46.620]  They're control freaks.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:48.161]  I do not want to be with these people.
[02:21:48.902 --> 02:21:51.404]  So it's like swim... You ever swam down like 50 feet free diving?
[02:21:51.484 --> 02:21:51.804]  I've done it.
[02:21:52.925 --> 02:21:54.447]  Some folks go a thousand feet free diving.
[02:21:54.467 --> 02:21:55.227]  You think you're tough going to 50?
[02:21:56.188 --> 02:21:57.309]  Your lungs compress at about 50.
[02:21:57.509 --> 02:21:58.650]  That's why it gets easier down there.
[02:21:58.670 --> 02:22:01.633]  If you can get deep, all of a sudden it puts pressure on your blood.
[02:22:03.171 --> 02:22:05.193]  The oxygen is more buoyant, more bioavailable.
[02:22:05.733 --> 02:22:06.434]  It's really incredible.
[02:22:07.055 --> 02:22:11.198]  You've just got to remind yourself, I've been down here about a minute and a half and I'm feeling good.
[02:22:11.218 --> 02:22:12.099]  I've got to go back up.
[02:22:12.119 --> 02:22:16.323]  As soon as you start going back up, though, you can panic because the blood isn't as buoyant anymore.
[02:22:17.104 --> 02:22:20.407]  And that last 30, 40 feet, your brain is like, woo!
[02:22:20.607 --> 02:22:21.728]  I'm dying here, baby!
[02:22:22.749 --> 02:22:24.731]  But the point here is the feeling I get
[02:22:25.988 --> 02:22:32.671]  Getting away from Hollywood, saying no to the threat, saying no to them threatening to even kill me is like going for air.
[02:22:33.271 --> 02:22:36.252]  It's not like I'm a champion and say no to their payoffs and it's hard.
[02:22:36.532 --> 02:22:38.213]  It's like clawing for air, man.
[02:22:38.733 --> 02:22:40.594]  It's like get me to God, get me away from them.
[02:22:44.055 --> 02:22:44.596]  Get me to God.
[02:22:44.636 --> 02:22:49.218]  But see, I can't get there until I bust the surface and it's like, oh Jesus, thank you.
[02:22:49.278 --> 02:22:50.199]  You understand that, folks?
[02:22:50.659 --> 02:22:54.081]  We're not with the New World Order because we're goody two-shoes.
[02:22:54.401 --> 02:22:55.082]  I'm a sinner.
[02:22:55.762 --> 02:22:56.482]  I'm a killer.
[02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:00.685]  I want to shove ice picks through my enemy's eyeballs.
[02:23:01.625 --> 02:23:03.086]  But I love Jesus and I love children.
[02:23:03.606 --> 02:23:04.467]  And I'm not with Satan.
[02:23:05.538 --> 02:23:06.118]  You understand that?
[02:23:07.119 --> 02:23:08.660]  And I just want to get that across to everybody.
[02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:09.921]  Get your soul right, folks.
[02:23:10.581 --> 02:23:12.142]  Get your soul right.
[02:23:12.823 --> 02:23:16.705]  They're coming after Christians because we are the real deal, not the fake ones.
[02:23:17.045 --> 02:23:19.166]  That's how they come after Christians is putting all these fake ones out.
[02:23:19.907 --> 02:23:21.128]  But people that really love God.
[02:23:22.789 --> 02:23:23.889]  So you feel like you're drowning?
[02:23:23.909 --> 02:23:24.950]  You feel like you can't get air?
[02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:26.071]  You feel like you're suffocated?
[02:23:26.091 --> 02:23:26.711]  You're depressed?
[02:23:27.392 --> 02:23:30.013]  Get on your knees and ask Christ to come into you and defend you.
[02:23:30.053 --> 02:23:30.934]  You won't have any more fear.
[02:23:32.039 --> 02:23:35.460]  The only fear you'll have is separation from Christ.
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:42.902]  And then, as long as you're doing good and standing up for what's right and fighting evil, you're not going to have that judgmental thing on your shoulder all day telling you how bad you are.
[02:23:42.942 --> 02:23:43.802]  That's the devil.
[02:23:44.282 --> 02:23:45.442]  The devil's the accuser.
[02:23:46.343 --> 02:23:48.863]  You submit to God, the path's going to be clear.
[02:23:49.563 --> 02:23:51.464]  The question is, are you going to follow those directives?
[02:23:53.364 --> 02:23:55.805]  All I get is love from God, despite how bad I am.
[02:23:56.704 --> 02:23:58.665]  Which makes me ashamed of how good God is.
[02:23:59.085 --> 02:24:01.147]  But see, God made us and knows us better than we do.
[02:24:01.787 --> 02:24:06.169]  But just get right, folks, and I know most of you already have, and I'm not up here on some damn high horse.
[02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:09.071]  I have the knowledge of good and evil, just like Adam did.
[02:24:09.672 --> 02:24:11.713]  I'm just telling you, man, God's the answer.
[02:24:11.833 --> 02:24:12.473]  Get with God.
[02:24:12.493 --> 02:24:14.855]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls and I'm ranting.
[02:24:16.195 --> 02:24:16.716]  Woo!
[02:24:16.956 --> 02:24:18.617]  Laura in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:24:18.657 --> 02:24:18.997]  Welcome.
[02:24:20.878 --> 02:24:21.438]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:22.159 --> 02:24:22.459]  Welcome.
[02:24:23.596 --> 02:24:25.096]  Hi, my name is Laura.
[02:24:25.276 --> 02:24:26.837]  I live in Pearland, Texas.
[02:24:27.577 --> 02:24:29.317]  I have been here for two years.
[02:24:29.337 --> 02:24:31.298]  I came from Los Angeles, California.
[02:24:31.318 --> 02:24:33.158]  I lived there 49 years of my life.
[02:24:34.098 --> 02:24:38.960]  And I was calling to talk to you about the impact of illegal immigration on my life.
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:41.380]  Yes, tell us what it's been like for you.
[02:24:43.121 --> 02:24:46.461]  Well, it was pretty hardcore.
[02:24:47.201 --> 02:24:49.242]  And I have to tell you that President Trump is
[02:24:50.288 --> 02:24:53.029]  He's 150% right.
[02:24:53.089 --> 02:25:01.311]  Let me tell you, the worst of the worst are coming, and I spent the majority of my life growing up amongst these people.
[02:25:01.872 --> 02:25:08.414]  And I'm not saying all of them, but far... No, but America's wide open and weak now, so we're being exploited by the same groups that have exploited Mexico.
[02:25:09.394 --> 02:25:11.134]  You're exactly right, and that's what it is.
[02:25:11.275 --> 02:25:15.236]  It's the people who are supporting illegal immigration are the ones who profit off of it.
[02:25:15.476 --> 02:25:15.856]  You're right.
[02:25:16.116 --> 02:25:19.157]  Men have not stood up to thugs and show thugs have taken over.
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:32.862]  That's right, and one of my pet peeves about illegal immigration is, I always want to bring this up, these people come here for a better way of life because they're fleeing these countries that are, you know, poverty stricken and cartel ridden.
[02:25:32.902 --> 02:25:38.923]  Well, why do they come to our country, live here for two, three years, and then they go back to those countries on two and three week vacations?
[02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:40.924]  This is what I want to know.
[02:25:40.944 --> 02:25:45.305]  If it's so hard for them to live in their countries, then why do they come here and then they go back on vacation?
[02:25:45.405 --> 02:25:46.745]  I've seen it time and time again.
[02:25:48.359 --> 02:25:50.040]  And again, we're not building up these countries.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:52.022]  We're being brought down, which is the globalist plan.
[02:25:52.042 --> 02:25:53.022]  We're not helping these people.
[02:25:53.503 --> 02:25:55.704]  It's designed to... I mean, they admit it.
[02:25:55.884 --> 02:26:01.368]  What do you make about the disease coming in and then citizens get blamed for the disease, even though it's admitted that it's the government?
[02:26:01.388 --> 02:26:03.690]  If we're going to let these people in, we might as well treat them and take care of them.
[02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:07.052]  But to bring them in and let them spread disease, that is meant to bankrupt the country.
[02:26:08.072 --> 02:26:14.641]  And I'm outraged because I can totally relate to your conversation with the gentleman before regarding vaccinations.
[02:26:14.801 --> 02:26:17.545]  My 32-year-old child was vaccine-injured.
[02:26:17.865 --> 02:26:21.550]  He was vaccine-injured at age 7 and he suffered from severe Tourette syndrome.
[02:26:21.611 --> 02:26:24.575]  This is during the epidemic of the growing, you know,
[02:26:25.175 --> 02:26:29.778]  ADD, ADHD, OCD, Tourette Syndrome.
[02:26:29.798 --> 02:26:38.723]  Let me tell you, I was part of it, and I am outraged that these people are... How can they have open borders and have these people coming through, and then they demand that we are the ones who get vaccinated?
[02:26:38.743 --> 02:26:54.473]  I know so many parents, so many parents, who had perfectly behaved boys, and then whatever they're adding to these vaccines, and they test them, there's hundreds of things in them, is causing... You'll get a brand new... Like Trump said in earlier tweets, your kid gets the shot, and now the behavior's totally different.
[02:26:55.498 --> 02:27:06.771]  Aluminum, formaldehyde, aborted fetal parts, thimerosal, hello, the most deadly things on earth known to man, and we put those in our children?
[02:27:06.991 --> 02:27:08.453]  Believe me, I didn't know before.
[02:27:08.733 --> 02:27:10.035]  Let me tell you another thing I'm going to tell you.
[02:27:10.095 --> 02:27:11.616]  I know a lot about the human immune system.
[02:27:11.677 --> 02:27:12.758]  I'm HIV positive.
[02:27:13.338 --> 02:27:14.279]  I know a lot about it.
[02:27:14.319 --> 02:27:15.659]  I've done a lot of research about this.
[02:27:15.699 --> 02:27:18.040]  Then my kid gets vaccine injured.
[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:18.941]  I had no idea.
[02:27:19.221 --> 02:27:21.382]  And doctors are saying, we don't know what it is.
[02:27:21.442 --> 02:27:22.322]  It's not vaccines.
[02:27:22.422 --> 02:27:22.683]  Bull.
[02:27:23.003 --> 02:27:23.363]  Bull.
[02:27:23.623 --> 02:27:24.723]  It is the vaccines.
[02:27:25.104 --> 02:27:25.464]  It is.
[02:27:25.824 --> 02:27:28.405]  Well, they spread HIV to begin with in the vaccines.
[02:27:28.425 --> 02:27:29.266]  That's been declassified.
[02:27:29.286 --> 02:27:30.286]  They call it conspiracy theory.
[02:27:30.306 --> 02:27:31.347]  I think everybody's dumb.
[02:27:31.367 --> 02:27:36.009]  Ma'am, they sterilized people in Africa and Latin America and Asia and declassified it in the 90s.
[02:27:36.269 --> 02:27:40.211]  The UN would add a hormone that's only released in women in second trimester.
[02:27:41.001 --> 02:27:44.923]  Well, the body would then, in the tetanus shot, see that hormone and cause an abortion each time.
[02:27:45.283 --> 02:27:49.986]  And also autoimmune problems in the uterus and ovaries.
[02:27:50.506 --> 02:28:05.514]  And so absolutely, when they add, because they grow a lot of these vaccines on fetal tissue, when they put it in there with a bacteria or virus that your body has a response, again, I keep saying it every segment because it's so key, your body then starts having an autoimmune response to fetal DNA.
[02:28:05.834 --> 02:28:10.257]  Well, a lot of that same DNA is in you, and then that's how you get an autoimmune disorder.
[02:28:11.178 --> 02:28:11.438]  Right.
[02:28:12.279 --> 02:28:13.400]  Our bodies reject it.
[02:28:13.841 --> 02:28:14.601]  It rejects it.
[02:28:14.721 --> 02:28:15.322]  Absolutely.
[02:28:15.422 --> 02:28:18.225]  Listen, my grandmother died at 93 years old.
[02:28:18.885 --> 02:28:19.145]  Almost 93.
[02:28:20.447 --> 02:28:24.330]  She never had an allergy until she was like 70 years old.
[02:28:25.051 --> 02:28:27.093]  And it was all the vaccines and all the crap.
[02:28:27.213 --> 02:28:29.215]  Everybody I know has allergies now.
[02:28:29.615 --> 02:28:30.856]  I was up in D.C.
[02:28:31.297 --> 02:28:31.977]  We had a D.C.
[02:28:32.037 --> 02:28:33.619]  cop hired as our security, other people.
[02:28:34.039 --> 02:28:35.520]  He said everybody he knows is shit.
[02:28:36.401 --> 02:28:37.942]  We were going to meet with some State Department people.
[02:28:37.982 --> 02:28:39.663]  The headlady was sick with allergies that day.
[02:28:40.384 --> 02:28:41.525]  The military's all sick.
[02:28:41.825 --> 02:28:42.746]  We're getting hit.
[02:28:42.786 --> 02:28:43.806]  We're getting hit hard.
[02:28:43.866 --> 02:28:45.387]  Don't lie to yourselves about this.
[02:28:45.748 --> 02:28:47.229]  And it's the shadow government doing it.
[02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:49.750]  That's why they're so pissed that Trump might get control.
[02:28:50.111 --> 02:28:53.773]  But I've got callers saying, third-dimensional chess, why Trump's flip-flopping on this.
[02:28:54.214 --> 02:28:56.976]  We'll take those calls when we come back with Jeff and others.
[02:28:57.016 --> 02:28:57.656]  Thank you, Lauren.
[02:28:57.716 --> 02:28:58.437]  God bless you.
[02:28:58.697 --> 02:28:59.337]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:59.397 --> 02:29:00.218]  NewsWars.com.
[02:29:02.156 --> 02:29:06.518]  If you are trying to... The globalists are hammering humanity with bad halogens.
[02:29:06.978 --> 02:29:08.298]  Fluoride being chief amongst them.
[02:29:08.778 --> 02:29:13.680]  While they try to keep the one good halogen out of the food supply, and that's iodine.
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:16.501]  But most iodine isn't pure, so you can't absorb it.
[02:29:16.721 --> 02:29:17.201]  Well, guess what?
[02:29:17.321 --> 02:29:19.462]  X2's back in stock, and it's discounted.
[02:29:19.482 --> 02:29:24.264]  And when you get a bottle of the original X2, you get a free bottle of X3 to see how amazing it is.
[02:29:24.764 --> 02:29:26.905]  Only at Infowarstore.com.
[02:29:27.305 --> 02:29:28.285]  Now, stay with us.
[02:29:28.405 --> 02:29:30.226]  I'll break down the latest developments.
[02:29:43.093 --> 02:29:44.335]  There is a war.
[02:29:44.355 --> 02:29:45.796]  It's happening now.
[02:29:46.476 --> 02:29:48.518]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:29:49.039 --> 02:29:51.301]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:29:51.621 --> 02:29:53.123]  We are the resistance.
[02:29:53.543 --> 02:29:55.365]  We are the Infowar.
[02:30:01.974 --> 02:30:06.160]  There are a lot of people out there that say they're on the front lines of the fight for liberty.
[02:30:06.941 --> 02:30:07.441]  And some are.
[02:30:08.983 --> 02:30:10.625]  But I'm not doing this to be famous.
[02:30:10.706 --> 02:30:12.348]  I'm doing this because it was the right thing to do.
[02:30:12.408 --> 02:30:14.911]  And let me tell you, I've gotten deep into this fight.
[02:30:15.672 --> 02:30:19.097]  And I've got the globalists pulling out every stop and every dirty trick you can imagine.
[02:30:19.798 --> 02:30:31.969]  But because you've stood with Infowars, because you've spread the word, and because you've bought the products we sell that fund our operations, we are here in the face of the globalist tyranny being more aggressive and more effective than ever.
[02:30:32.689 --> 02:30:33.730]  I just went to D.C.
[02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:38.855]  and bullhorned the president while Jack Dorsey was inside, lying, saying they don't censor conservatives.
[02:30:39.435 --> 02:30:42.798]  Ilhan Omar is calling for Trump to be banned, for God's sakes.
[02:30:43.499 --> 02:30:44.400]  And we were in D.C.
[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:52.427]  doing dozens of major interviews and really affecting change and getting the president to go after the deep state with criminal charges, which you heard about years ago.
[02:30:52.647 --> 02:30:54.749]  And now the president's finally getting ready to do it.
[02:30:55.469 --> 02:30:56.951]  We are the real change agents.
[02:30:57.051 --> 02:30:59.233]  We are effective because we tell the truth.
[02:30:59.893 --> 02:31:03.056]  But without you backing us, we won't be here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:03.577 --> 02:31:07.080]  Without you supporting us, the globalists will be able to shut us down.
[02:31:08.467 --> 02:31:13.630]  Please understand that my philosophy is to give you the very best information out there.
[02:31:14.350 --> 02:31:17.793]  And my philosophy with products we sell to fund ourselves is very simple.
[02:31:18.493 --> 02:31:27.418]  Sell the highest quality that I, myself, and my family take, give it to you at a great price so that it's a win-win, so you continue to want to come back and get it over and over again.
[02:31:28.018 --> 02:31:31.521]  We're running two new specials for one week and one week only.
[02:31:32.501 --> 02:31:33.582]  The biggest one ever is
[02:31:35.035 --> 02:31:36.735]  X2, we were able to get back in stock.
[02:31:36.896 --> 02:31:38.356]  Deep Earth, pure iodine crystals.
[02:31:39.176 --> 02:31:42.437]  Read about iodine deficiency, how it has lower IQs, you don't have it.
[02:31:42.837 --> 02:31:45.378]  Boosted IQs, how it's the building block of the whole body.
[02:31:45.898 --> 02:31:47.598]  Just as essential as water or oxygen.
[02:31:47.918 --> 02:31:50.379]  We have the true pure iodine that you can absorb.
[02:31:50.399 --> 02:31:52.459]  About 98% of people can.
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:55.680]  And it's just a game changer.
[02:31:56.020 --> 02:31:56.960]  We have it back in stock.
[02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.601]  And when you get one bottle of X2, already 25% off.
[02:32:00.301 --> 02:32:01.161]  Already a great deal.
[02:32:04.113 --> 02:32:07.557]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[02:32:08.137 --> 02:32:08.958]  Absolutely free.
[02:32:09.379 --> 02:32:13.443]  Now, we sat out with top scientists and said, could we make X2 better?
[02:32:13.523 --> 02:32:14.845]  This has the deep-earth crystals in it.
[02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:15.385]  X3 does.
[02:32:15.645 --> 02:32:16.486]  And they said, yes.
[02:32:17.167 --> 02:32:23.494]  You'd have the other two types of iodine in there because a low percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[02:32:23.894 --> 02:32:25.656]  Just like most people can't absorb
[02:32:26.597 --> 02:32:28.398]  Iodine that isn't atomic.
[02:32:28.858 --> 02:32:29.899]  So again, it's a catch-22.
[02:32:30.619 --> 02:32:32.400]  So we created X3.
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:39.104]  Now X3 is weaker on purpose, because again, some people can't handle the strongest iodine.
[02:32:39.444 --> 02:32:42.926]  Consult your physician before you take it, because this is real stuff.
[02:32:43.766 --> 02:32:49.408]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, get a bottle of X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:49.909 --> 02:32:57.332]  Incredibly popular, thousands of five-star reviews, and get a free bottle of X3 so you can experience how amazing it is as well.
[02:32:57.772 --> 02:33:01.053]  InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:33:01.514 --> 02:33:02.654]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:33:06.276 --> 02:33:08.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.407 --> 02:33:43.702]  You know, people ask me, how do you handle getting attacked by mainstream media and being loud about it?
[02:33:46.104 --> 02:33:47.686]  And I always say, don't feel sorry for me.
[02:33:49.347 --> 02:33:51.109]  Be involved and fight back.
[02:33:51.209 --> 02:33:52.510]  These are criminals we're dealing with.
[02:33:53.837 --> 02:33:59.702]  I mean, I see articles all the time that are literally 99% not true.
[02:34:01.163 --> 02:34:03.545]  They had one in the New York Observer that I didn't even read all of it.
[02:34:03.625 --> 02:34:05.126]  It was just totally made up.
[02:34:06.107 --> 02:34:10.890]  They just randomly go find any leftist in Austin just to make up any story they want.
[02:34:11.631 --> 02:34:21.999]  There was an article in BuzzFeed like last year, it said Alex Jones was once walking down the hallway at a movie theater and he told one of the servers at Alamo Draft House that he doesn't believe any of it and it's a fake.
[02:34:23.629 --> 02:34:23.849]  What?
[02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:26.670]  I don't believe in America.
[02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:27.931]  That's why I'm helping relaunch it.
[02:34:27.971 --> 02:34:29.332]  I don't believe in pro-life.
[02:34:29.352 --> 02:34:31.152]  That's why I go out and protest for children.
[02:34:32.193 --> 02:34:33.413]  Of course I believe what I'm doing.
[02:34:33.734 --> 02:34:35.715]  It's like saying Trump didn't want to win the presidency.
[02:34:35.895 --> 02:34:36.735]  B.S.
[02:34:40.056 --> 02:34:41.597]  I've had many conversations with the President.
[02:34:41.637 --> 02:34:42.898]  All he says is, let's keep fighting.
[02:34:43.158 --> 02:34:44.058]  We're going to win, Alex.
[02:34:44.298 --> 02:34:46.319]  We're going to restore the country and save the planet.
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:50.021]  Remember Trump said, I don't care about a Nobel Peace Prize.
[02:34:50.201 --> 02:34:51.922]  I want planetary victory.
[02:34:54.192 --> 02:35:03.777]  Now, one caller says, well, Trump went from saying vaccines are dangerous, there's too many of them, they're hurting kids, autism's way up, to saying, take your measles shot, and we're gonna go to Patty, who's a nurse.
[02:35:05.238 --> 02:35:22.188]  Jeff says it's 3D chess, and you know, I used to hear that, and not really believe that, but on some cases, I've actually had conversations with people, I'll just leave it at that, I'm not gonna say the president, but people that talk to the president, NRA board members, I'll leave it at that, where Trump said, listen,
[02:35:23.271 --> 02:35:30.376]  Let me just tell Pelosi and all them, sure, whatever you want, we'll look at doing it to get them to say we want a total ban on guns.
[02:35:31.577 --> 02:35:35.199]  And then Pelosi and Schumer, two weeks later at the meeting, I'd already been told that it was coming.
[02:35:37.521 --> 02:35:39.522]  I mean, I was let in on this, just so I wouldn't go haywire.
[02:35:41.723 --> 02:35:44.565]  And Trump goes, oh, we'll look at everything.
[02:35:46.687 --> 02:35:48.968]  And they said, we want to ban all guns, basically.
[02:35:49.028 --> 02:35:50.669]  And then they would look like fools.
[02:35:51.450 --> 02:35:52.711]  So I get that Trump does that.
[02:35:54.147 --> 02:35:57.749]  The measles vaccine doesn't protect you from the measles almost all the time.
[02:35:57.829 --> 02:35:58.750]  The insert admits it.
[02:35:59.330 --> 02:36:00.131]  They have to tell you this.
[02:36:00.171 --> 02:36:10.337]  It's like the HPV shot says it protects girls against human papillomavirus in their cervix that only kills like 3,000 people a year, which is super rare cancer compared to 340 million people.
[02:36:10.637 --> 02:36:13.499]  And then that's run down people that usually have HIV, AIDS.
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:17.761]  And then, you know, a common cold can kill you.
[02:36:20.383 --> 02:36:23.505]  And so I just don't like to legitimize this stuff at all.
[02:36:24.591 --> 02:36:27.593]  And I understand the president wants to sound reasonable, but we'll go to Patty in Wyoming.
[02:36:27.633 --> 02:36:28.554]  But first, Jeff in Oregon.
[02:36:28.914 --> 02:36:30.295]  What do you think's really going on here, Jeff?
[02:36:32.317 --> 02:36:32.717]  Hey, Alex.
[02:36:33.198 --> 02:36:33.398]  Hi.
[02:36:34.098 --> 02:36:34.939]  Too much is going on.
[02:36:35.499 --> 02:36:36.540]  Thank you for your show.
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:37.721]  Thank you for your dedication.
[02:36:39.282 --> 02:36:43.485]  On the vaccine thing, I think it's a bit crazy that people think that we're against vaccination.
[02:36:43.525 --> 02:36:43.886]  We're not.
[02:36:43.926 --> 02:36:45.227]  We're against what they're putting in it.
[02:36:46.528 --> 02:36:47.028]  Exactly.
[02:36:47.048 --> 02:36:48.589]  We're against their liability protection.
[02:36:48.609 --> 02:36:49.650]  We're against all the additives.
[02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:51.451]  We're against the insert that says it can kill you.
[02:36:51.551 --> 02:36:52.012]  Exactly.
[02:36:52.648 --> 02:36:56.694]  Yeah, and if you're going to say, and like you said, like you hit on a lot of points all the time.
[02:36:57.095 --> 02:36:58.197]  Well, that's why I listened to you.
[02:36:58.517 --> 02:37:01.963]  But like you said, if your child's vaccinated, why are you worried about it?
[02:37:02.003 --> 02:37:03.165]  Doesn't your vaccination work?
[02:37:03.225 --> 02:37:04.487]  Don't you have faith in it?
[02:37:06.271 --> 02:37:07.252]  Let me ask you this, Jeff.
[02:37:07.592 --> 02:37:13.857]  Why do you think, I'm sure you saw this, 2020, back when it was still... The mainstream media used to tell the truth sometimes.
[02:37:14.217 --> 02:37:27.128]  2020, in 2003, had documents from 2000 that were leaked to them by the CDC board member, of the CDC head saying, oh my god, we've brain damaged millions with the vaccines, it's causing autoimmune disorders in boys mainly.
[02:37:27.788 --> 02:37:32.670]  There'll be a rebellion if anybody finds out, but I'd never give this to my grandson.
[02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:33.730]  We've got to cover this up.
[02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:34.490]  We've got to stop it.
[02:37:34.930 --> 02:37:35.510]  Well, guess what?
[02:37:35.571 --> 02:37:36.291]  They covered it up.
[02:37:36.331 --> 02:37:37.111]  They didn't stop it.
[02:37:37.671 --> 02:37:39.032]  Now, that was on ABC News.
[02:37:39.092 --> 02:37:40.112]  Anybody can pull that up.
[02:37:40.472 --> 02:37:41.672]  It's confirmed!
[02:37:42.253 --> 02:37:43.413]  There's no debating it!
[02:37:44.373 --> 02:37:46.274]  And they go, oh, Alex Jones says he's fake news.
[02:37:46.314 --> 02:37:46.734]  No, I don't.
[02:37:47.334 --> 02:37:49.295]  Years ago, they tricked me on two topics.
[02:37:50.598 --> 02:37:52.919]  Even though I didn't produce the fake Pizzagate story.
[02:37:53.159 --> 02:37:55.240]  There was real pedophilia going on in New York and the WikiLeaks.
[02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:58.922]  They got us to cover some of what the media was covering in D.C.
[02:37:59.322 --> 02:38:03.724]  The media said, oh, just say you're sorry for the fact that that place was a wrong steer.
[02:38:03.884 --> 02:38:04.484]  They never get it.
[02:38:04.964 --> 02:38:05.865]  Say they're sorry when they're wrong.
[02:38:06.365 --> 02:38:08.166]  Oh, Jones admits he's fake about Pizzagate.
[02:38:08.526 --> 02:38:10.727]  Same thing with the whole Sandy Hook situation.
[02:38:11.067 --> 02:38:15.669]  And the minute I said, yeah, I think your kids died, but this isn't a big topic I cover and I didn't create it.
[02:38:16.009 --> 02:38:17.710]  That's when there was blood in the water with the left.
[02:38:18.210 --> 02:38:20.452]  Because to them, it's not about apology.
[02:38:20.492 --> 02:38:24.814]  It's about you saying you're bad, so they can be the moral high ground and take your freedom.
[02:38:24.834 --> 02:38:25.275]  You understand?
[02:38:26.455 --> 02:38:26.936]  Absolutely.
[02:38:28.517 --> 02:38:31.438]  What was your point about Trump and this flip-flopping on vaccines?
[02:38:32.639 --> 02:38:39.423]  Okay, I equate all of that to people thinking that their boat is sinking because it rained and there's water on the deck.
[02:38:40.244 --> 02:38:46.668]  Every time that I see people, uh, oh my god, Trump did this, I have, um, I don't know if it's an
[02:38:47.475 --> 02:38:51.898]  Just an over amount of faith in him, but I have been just like, sit back and watch.
[02:38:52.078 --> 02:38:57.442]  I have not freaked out about one time, not on anything that he's done, not with the gun grab, nothing.
[02:38:58.163 --> 02:39:02.366]  I just think that he has an intelligence level and he plays on a different field than us.
[02:39:02.946 --> 02:39:03.667]  I mean, look at him.
[02:39:04.247 --> 02:39:06.549]  A lot of people say he was given his first 10 million.
[02:39:06.629 --> 02:39:07.990]  And I like to tell people this.
[02:39:08.631 --> 02:39:09.131]  You know what?
[02:39:09.471 --> 02:39:11.713]  A lot of people win the lottery and they're broke.
[02:39:11.873 --> 02:39:12.433]  In two years.
[02:39:13.554 --> 02:39:14.135]  In two years!
[02:39:16.238 --> 02:39:18.359]  And he has done incredible things.
[02:39:18.419 --> 02:39:19.560]  He's an incredible man.
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:30.564]  And with today being the camera-filled society that we are, and him being the family man that he is, if there were dirt on him being a family man, it would be out.
[02:39:31.305 --> 02:39:32.605]  And that to me... No, I hear what you're saying.
[02:39:32.625 --> 02:39:38.167]  So you're saying he brings that out now so they can't say, oh, look, he's against vaccines, but then he can come back later and expose them.
[02:39:38.227 --> 02:39:39.208]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:40.356 --> 02:39:44.780]  Patty in Wyoming's a registered nurse, wants to talk about vaccines and offering the inserts.
[02:39:45.101 --> 02:39:45.381]  Go ahead.
[02:39:45.401 --> 02:39:46.162]  Thanks for calling, Patty.
[02:39:46.202 --> 02:39:46.682]  Thanks for holding.
[02:39:48.004 --> 02:39:48.544]  Hey, Alex.
[02:39:48.624 --> 02:39:49.285]  I love you.
[02:39:49.365 --> 02:39:52.048]  I love your guest host, Mike Adams.
[02:39:52.128 --> 02:39:52.388]  Thank you.
[02:39:52.408 --> 02:39:56.072]  I have four products on AutoShip, $200 a month.
[02:39:56.132 --> 02:39:56.452]  Thank you.
[02:39:56.472 --> 02:39:57.853]  Ma'am, we couldn't do it without you.
[02:39:58.134 --> 02:40:03.779]  You are literally standing against Hillary and George Soros, because she's still in control of the shadow government, and that's who's running the attacks on us.
[02:40:03.799 --> 02:40:04.240]  So thank you.
[02:40:05.296 --> 02:40:17.547]  Amen, and a sneaky way to introduce people who maybe aren't listeners or aren't awake, what I do is I send a lot of gifts to friends and family from the InfoWars store, and then that kind of wakes them up a little bit.
[02:40:17.747 --> 02:40:23.472]  I actually have two people now that watch you and go to your website regularly because of gifts that I've sent.
[02:40:23.956 --> 02:40:27.257]  So I just want to put that out as a suggestion.
[02:40:27.817 --> 02:40:29.097]  Patty, that is so beautiful.
[02:40:29.397 --> 02:40:38.779]  You send somebody some TurboForce, send somebody some of the protein bars, and then say, oh, by the way, you might want to tune in to the Forbidden Show and actually see what is actually being said versus what you're told.
[02:40:38.799 --> 02:40:44.540]  Yeah, and you know, when they see the quality of the products, they can't help but go.
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:46.881]  And I also encourage them to go.
[02:40:46.921 --> 02:40:48.161]  I'm like, here, I'm going to send you this.
[02:40:48.221 --> 02:40:49.101]  I think you might like it.
[02:40:49.537 --> 02:40:52.258]  But you know, feel free to go to the store, go to the website.
[02:40:52.338 --> 02:40:53.898]  There's a lot of great information.
[02:40:53.958 --> 02:40:57.059]  He has very informative guest hosts that, you know, like Mike Adams.
[02:40:57.539 --> 02:41:00.180]  And I buy I also buy products from Mike as well.
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:04.482]  And they have it has really opened to people that I've sent gifts to.
[02:41:04.782 --> 02:41:05.522]  Now they watch you.
[02:41:06.255 --> 02:41:07.315]  Just about every week.
[02:41:07.335 --> 02:41:09.476]  Well, every one of you are the only ambassadors we have.
[02:41:09.496 --> 02:41:11.356]  You know the reason we're still here is God bless you.
[02:41:11.676 --> 02:41:14.337]  What is your view on the vaccines overall, Patty, as a registered nurse?
[02:41:15.197 --> 02:41:32.940]  Well, as a registered nurse, I was actually asked to leave a clinic and told that I wasn't a good fit because I sided with the parents of a toddler who was brought in and encouraged them to do their research because they were concerned about the amount of shots that their baby, their little baby boy, had been given.
[02:41:33.348 --> 02:41:37.451]  And I said, do the research and then another which infuriated management.
[02:41:38.272 --> 02:41:44.896]  And I said, you are that you are the responsible for your child's health, not the medical establishment.
[02:41:44.956 --> 02:41:56.004]  And if you don't agree with the vaccine schedule, it's your right to ask them to change it or not have the vaccines given at that, you know, at that time in that child's development.
[02:41:56.585 --> 02:42:00.026]  A child's immune system isn't even developed until they're two years old.
[02:42:00.126 --> 02:42:06.769]  Why are we giving immune response vaccines to children whose immune systems aren't even developed?
[02:42:06.829 --> 02:42:07.109]  That's right.
[02:42:07.129 --> 02:42:07.969]  They get immunity.
[02:42:08.009 --> 02:42:09.009]  Stay there because you're a nurse.
[02:42:09.029 --> 02:42:10.470]  You know about this, but I've read the science.
[02:42:11.425 --> 02:42:23.915]  But imagine, they tell us to go do research on a hotel we're going to stay at, to do research on a 401k, to do research on a college we're going to go to, and go look at people's ratings, but oh, Facebook, Twitter trying to ban people having ratings or articles about vaccines.
[02:42:24.235 --> 02:42:26.337]  There's no liability to the companies.
[02:42:26.698 --> 02:42:27.578]  They're protected.
[02:42:27.919 --> 02:42:29.019]  There's no safety studies.
[02:42:29.039 --> 02:42:33.863]  When we come back, I want to ask you the rest of the story and how you think parents and others should respond.
[02:42:33.883 --> 02:42:34.864]  What an amazing lady.
[02:42:34.924 --> 02:42:35.204]  Patty?
[02:42:36.408 --> 02:42:39.090]  In Wyoming, a registered nurse telling you what's going on.
[02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.490]  That's right.
[02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:41.451]  Vaccines do nothing the first two years anyways.
[02:42:42.011 --> 02:42:42.832]  Think about all that.
[02:42:43.252 --> 02:42:44.813]  This is all known facts.
[02:42:45.793 --> 02:42:48.895]  What you're doing is wrecking these children's immune systems forever.
[02:42:50.256 --> 02:42:50.616]  Wow.
[02:42:51.477 --> 02:42:54.178]  The more vaccines we take, the more we see our problems multiply.
[02:42:54.559 --> 02:42:55.279]  What's really going on?
[02:42:55.299 --> 02:42:57.160]  We'll ask Patty her view straight ahead.
[02:43:02.203 --> 02:43:03.123]  Frank in North Carolina.
[02:43:03.304 --> 02:43:04.244]  Frank in North Carolina.
[02:43:04.264 --> 02:43:05.285]  Thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:05.365 --> 02:43:05.665]  Go ahead.
[02:43:06.723 --> 02:43:08.184]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:08.204 --> 02:43:11.266]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:12.047 --> 02:43:13.147]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:13.467 --> 02:43:15.209]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:15.909 --> 02:43:17.970]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:22.213]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:22.233 --> 02:43:24.734]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:25.535 --> 02:43:27.876]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:28.237 --> 02:43:29.337]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:29.577 --> 02:43:30.458]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:30.698 --> 02:43:31.739]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:32.159 --> 02:43:33.199]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:33.239 --> 02:43:34.319]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:34.339 --> 02:43:35.160]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:40.801]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:41.121 --> 02:43:45.381]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:45.601 --> 02:43:48.482]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:48.502 --> 02:43:49.142]  Do you understand?
[02:43:49.222 --> 02:43:50.482]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:50.862 --> 02:43:52.022]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:52.983 --> 02:43:57.963]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:43:58.884 --> 02:43:59.544]  Do you understand?
[02:43:59.564 --> 02:44:00.744]  I need your help, Frank!

[02:45:06.929 --> 02:45:10.850]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[02:45:11.291 --> 02:45:13.091]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:45:13.211 --> 02:45:14.212]  Good to talk to you.
[02:45:14.252 --> 02:45:18.413]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:45:18.633 --> 02:45:20.374]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[02:45:20.474 --> 02:45:24.855]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:45:25.075 --> 02:45:26.976]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[02:45:27.056 --> 02:45:31.397]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[02:45:31.497 --> 02:45:32.958]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:45:32.998 --> 02:45:33.538]  Tell us about it.
[02:45:33.558 --> 02:45:34.278]  Well, it's really great.
[02:45:34.298 --> 02:45:35.479]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[02:45:35.519 --> 02:45:35.959]  I take it.
[02:45:36.019 --> 02:45:36.639]  It tastes good.
[02:45:36.699 --> 02:45:38.400]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:40.161]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:45:40.321 --> 02:45:42.742]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[02:45:42.802 --> 02:45:43.603]  So, I really like it.
[02:45:43.623 --> 02:45:46.304]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:45:46.344 --> 02:45:47.885]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:45:48.005 --> 02:45:49.866]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:45:49.986 --> 02:45:50.466]  So, yeah.
[02:45:50.846 --> 02:45:52.707]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[02:45:53.167 --> 02:45:55.468]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[02:45:55.488 --> 02:45:56.769]  So, I'm glad you plugged it.
[02:45:56.929 --> 02:45:58.650]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:03.450 --> 02:46:05.090]  I cannot believe we even produced this.
[02:46:05.210 --> 02:46:08.171]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:46:08.471 --> 02:46:10.612]  I said, I'm a game changer.
[02:46:11.672 --> 02:46:12.452]  I'm a guru.
[02:46:13.672 --> 02:46:14.553]  I'm a scientist.
[02:46:15.673 --> 02:46:16.493]  I'm an activist.
[02:46:16.973 --> 02:46:19.374]  And other people aren't willing to do it.
[02:46:19.754 --> 02:46:22.934]  And I'll tell you right now, I'm here to ram heads with you.
[02:46:22.954 --> 02:46:25.095]  Energy drinks are bad.
[02:46:35.751 --> 02:46:36.772]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:46:36.872 --> 02:46:37.212]  Bad.
[02:46:37.372 --> 02:46:37.713]  Bad.
[02:46:37.873 --> 02:46:38.193]  Bad.
[02:46:38.273 --> 02:46:38.513]  Bad.
[02:46:38.613 --> 02:46:38.754]  Bad.
[02:46:38.774 --> 02:46:56.908]  Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[02:47:05.737 --> 02:47:11.863]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.733 --> 02:47:28.898]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:47:29.398 --> 02:47:31.761]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:36.607 --> 02:47:37.507]  This isn't Netflix.
[02:47:37.527 --> 02:47:38.668]  This isn't HBO, folks.
[02:47:38.688 --> 02:47:39.649]  This isn't Game of Thrones.
[02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:43.452]  This is the real fight on this planet with all the mystery around us for the future.
[02:47:43.472 --> 02:47:45.233]  The fight for consciousness.
[02:47:45.693 --> 02:47:46.854]  The fight for being.
[02:47:47.355 --> 02:47:49.016]  The fight for destiny.
[02:47:50.117 --> 02:47:56.061]  And if I've done anything right with all my obnoxiousness, it's that I'm awake and I'm trying to get others to think for themselves.
[02:47:56.361 --> 02:47:59.784]  And like the last caller said, all the great guests we have on are the things we do here.
[02:48:00.745 --> 02:48:07.809]  We have a very informative guest joining us to get into this synagogue shooting and more, and how the left is trying to stoke anti-Semitism online.
[02:48:08.350 --> 02:48:18.636]  And again, as a scientist, if you pull back, the left allows all the Jews run the world stuff on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:48:18.816 --> 02:48:20.217]  And I say let it, it's First Amendment.
[02:48:21.318 --> 02:48:25.260]  Then the left accuses those of us that aren't anti-Israel of being the anti-Semites.
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:26.341]  There's a dialectic here.
[02:48:28.328 --> 02:48:31.449]  And so people that say Hitler did a good job are left on YouTube.
[02:48:31.609 --> 02:48:32.009]  I'm not.
[02:48:32.189 --> 02:48:32.449]  Why?
[02:48:33.709 --> 02:48:34.829]  Because I'm unifying people.
[02:48:35.770 --> 02:48:36.670]  I want to unify people.
[02:48:37.650 --> 02:48:39.550]  I genuinely care about everybody.
[02:48:40.590 --> 02:48:46.972]  Doesn't mean if you've got a bunch of racist Hispanics or racist blacks that don't like me because of what color I am that I won't tell them screw off and get right back in their face.
[02:48:47.012 --> 02:48:47.752]  They're a bunch of idiots.
[02:48:48.472 --> 02:48:52.273]  But just like black folks shouldn't blame white supremacists that hate them for other white folks.
[02:48:53.753 --> 02:48:54.353]  So that's coming up.
[02:48:54.373 --> 02:48:56.534]  We'll do this segment more with calls.
[02:48:56.614 --> 02:48:57.874]  I've got to say this or we'll go bankrupt.
[02:48:59.193 --> 02:49:03.620]  I shouldn't sit here and promote the products and say, help keep us on air, get the products, because that's a byproduct of it.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:05.022]  These are really great products.
[02:49:05.703 --> 02:49:12.072]  And we've got ultimate bone broth formula at 50% off, even though we're very close to selling out on this.
[02:49:12.930 --> 02:49:14.591]  We haven't sold out on this in about six months.
[02:49:14.611 --> 02:49:17.573]  We're very close to selling out on this new, even stronger formula.
[02:49:18.074 --> 02:49:28.721]  We have it in chocolate flavor, and it's got a whole bunch of concentrated, healthy chicken-based bone broth with all of the incredible things that does for your bones, your energy, everything, meal replacement.
[02:49:28.741 --> 02:49:34.966]  A little scoop of this in with your whey or whatever for your pre-workout, post-workout, weight loss, you name it.
[02:49:35.006 --> 02:49:35.546]  It's incredible.
[02:49:36.087 --> 02:49:41.691]  Chicken bone broth powder, protein, multi-collagen complex blend.
[02:49:43.703 --> 02:49:44.324]  Collagen.
[02:49:45.526 --> 02:49:46.467]  Chicken collagen.
[02:49:46.487 --> 02:49:50.874]  A bunch of key herbs.
[02:49:52.396 --> 02:49:53.097]  Alfalfa.
[02:49:55.161 --> 02:49:56.142]  Choggy mushroom.
[02:49:56.823 --> 02:49:57.504]  Bee pollen.
[02:49:57.524 --> 02:49:58.185]  Turmeric root.
[02:49:59.218 --> 02:50:00.119]  And so much more.
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:02.181]  I mean, there's nothing stronger.
[02:50:02.201 --> 02:50:03.503]  Everybody loves bone broth.
[02:50:03.923 --> 02:50:05.204]  Everybody says it's all the rage.
[02:50:05.284 --> 02:50:08.988]  I looked at all the marketing five years ago and I said, what's the fastest growing thing?
[02:50:09.008 --> 02:50:09.909]  And they said, bone broths.
[02:50:10.390 --> 02:50:13.853]  We'll have one serving of something like this in a glass jar for the same price of this.
[02:50:14.674 --> 02:50:16.296]  So like, you know, 30 servings or whatever.
[02:50:16.696 --> 02:50:18.758]  Everybody feels the attributes and everything.
[02:50:18.778 --> 02:50:19.479]  Oh, this is great.
[02:50:19.780 --> 02:50:21.822]  We just give you the best, strongest concentrate out there.
[02:50:23.271 --> 02:50:25.152]  You need to get Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[02:50:25.212 --> 02:50:25.872]  It's amazing.
[02:50:25.972 --> 02:50:27.452]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:50:27.712 --> 02:50:29.353]  50% off for a limited time.
[02:50:29.433 --> 02:50:32.494]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:50:32.914 --> 02:50:36.495]  So, Patty's a registered nurse in Wyoming, giving her take on vaccines.
[02:50:36.895 --> 02:50:42.437]  We've had nurses on with their public names before, and they've gotten in trouble about how they give the preemie babies the vaccines.
[02:50:42.457 --> 02:50:48.499]  They stop breathing, so they've got to have the respirators ready, but the hospital orders it, or the other horrors.
[02:50:49.159 --> 02:50:52.820]  Have you ever seen any autoimmune responses or problems in children that take vaccines?
[02:50:54.398 --> 02:50:55.698]  Oh yes, many times.
[02:50:56.239 --> 02:50:57.539]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:57.719 --> 02:50:58.679]  It's horrible.
[02:50:59.199 --> 02:51:13.283]  And unfortunately, you know, most people trust the medical establishment to take care of their children, and I just encourage, and we all have to do that, and even though you don't think you're making any headway, we don't know if we
[02:51:17.333 --> 02:51:20.856]  If we plant a seed, when it's going to come to fruition.
[02:51:20.916 --> 02:51:22.817]  So we just have to keep planting those seeds.
[02:51:22.897 --> 02:51:24.959]  And I left that clinic and I don't care.
[02:51:24.999 --> 02:51:26.660]  I mean, I wasn't going to be a part of that.
[02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:33.786]  And if they were going to prevent me from helping to educate and encourage parents to protect their children, well, I don't, I'm not working there anyway.
[02:51:34.006 --> 02:51:35.026]  I'm not going to work there.
[02:51:35.507 --> 02:51:44.814]  But I think I really want to encourage people to understand that the medical profession is very indoctrinated and there are some of the most close-minded professionals out there.
[02:51:45.307 --> 02:51:46.068]  Let me ask you this.
[02:52:01.837 --> 02:52:10.760]  Who would take products that are secret, who would take products that have liability protection, who would take products that don't have any safety studies, and who have a long train of nightmare events behind them?
[02:52:11.301 --> 02:52:16.163]  Again, and now they want us to take more, more, more, and have the President to put hundreds of these things in us.
[02:52:16.583 --> 02:52:17.423]  God bless you, Patty.
[02:52:17.443 --> 02:52:17.863]  Keep it up.
[02:52:17.903 --> 02:52:18.563]  We salute you.
[02:52:18.924 --> 02:52:19.684]  What an amazing lady.
[02:52:21.525 --> 02:52:23.485]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[02:52:25.906 --> 02:52:26.827]  Who would that be?
[02:52:28.345 --> 02:52:29.586]  It'd be Tom and then Leonard.
[02:52:29.666 --> 02:52:31.587]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:34.069]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[02:52:34.109 --> 02:52:34.910]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[02:52:36.030 --> 02:52:36.431]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:36.491 --> 02:52:37.691]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:52:37.771 --> 02:52:39.833]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[02:52:40.073 --> 02:52:48.039]  I have the Info Ward decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, support the shirts, all the equipment.
[02:52:48.399 --> 02:52:50.260]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:51.221]  God bless you, brother.
[02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:59.622]  I keep, I have three or four InfoWars bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[02:52:59.662 --> 02:53:00.742]  You're our only hope, brother.
[02:53:00.762 --> 02:53:02.742]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[02:53:03.082 --> 02:53:05.863]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[02:53:06.963 --> 02:53:17.365]  And the reason why I called is, like I said, I need some anonymity here, but I'm a law officer in the state of Texas, just south of Fort Worth, so northeast Texas, I guess you could say.
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:21.021]  And with this Border Patrol issue, it's always been bad.
[02:53:21.061 --> 02:53:26.183]  There has always been illegals for as long as we've been here.
[02:53:26.743 --> 02:53:35.226]  But since probably... I noticed it about three or four years ago when it got really, really bad.
[02:53:35.746 --> 02:53:46.330]  There's one neighborhood of where I'm at where I started noticing MS-13 gang signs spray-painted on stop signs or in areas of where I'm at.
[02:53:47.239 --> 02:53:49.100]  And you start seeing the repercussions from that.
[02:53:49.821 --> 02:54:01.888]  You see the violence go up, the drugs flew into our areas, and it went from small town country to war zone.
[02:54:02.969 --> 02:54:04.089]  And I'm not even kidding.
[02:54:05.590 --> 02:54:11.194]  If anybody doesn't believe, like I said, I'm a true blue Texan, God-fearing, gun-toting kind of guy.
[02:54:12.274 --> 02:54:13.955]  We need to stand up and say something.
[02:54:13.975 --> 02:54:15.236]  You're one of the few that's doing it.
[02:54:15.436 --> 02:54:16.717]  I'm one of the few that's doing it.
[02:54:17.310 --> 02:54:21.193]  Most people are so comfortable thinking, we're Texas, we're red, we're always be.
[02:54:21.613 --> 02:54:22.694]  We don't have this problem.
[02:54:22.714 --> 02:54:25.176]  We're on the border and we're fighting this fight daily.
[02:54:25.597 --> 02:54:27.338]  I see it every day I go to work.
[02:54:27.898 --> 02:54:34.283]  And I'm telling you people, you need to wake up, look around where you're at, and protect yourselves however you have to.
[02:54:34.704 --> 02:54:37.986]  Have your food, have your water, and have your guns to defend yourself.
[02:54:38.767 --> 02:54:42.630]  Because we need to shut this border down, and we need to start taking care of our own.
[02:54:43.689 --> 02:54:45.550]  Well, let me break this down for folks.
[02:54:45.930 --> 02:54:49.651]  The previous record coming into El Paso was 3,000 a day.
[02:54:49.671 --> 02:54:52.652]  They reported a month ago they're getting 15,000 some days.
[02:54:53.373 --> 02:54:54.233]  There's no beds.
[02:54:54.273 --> 02:54:55.073]  There's no police.
[02:54:55.133 --> 02:54:57.614]  You imagine being one border patrol and having a thousand people to deal with.
[02:54:58.015 --> 02:54:58.775]  It's impossible.
[02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:01.037]  So people say, well, Trump's not done his job.
[02:55:01.077 --> 02:55:02.218]  He tried to get $12 billion.
[02:55:02.519 --> 02:55:03.179]  He got $1.3 billion.
[02:55:03.219 --> 02:55:05.402]  This is Congress.
[02:55:05.502 --> 02:55:06.523]  This is the Democrats.
[02:55:07.043 --> 02:55:08.405]  This is an admitted U.N.
[02:55:08.445 --> 02:55:08.645]  plan.
[02:55:08.685 --> 02:55:12.830]  And as you said, you go to Mexico or Guatemala, it's lawless.
[02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:13.671]  People are scared.
[02:55:14.091 --> 02:55:18.856]  Even previously safe areas like Cancun are not safe anymore.
[02:55:19.989 --> 02:55:39.557]  And so this is coming here, and when Nancy Pelosi says MS-13 are God's children, I've confirmed in Austin, a blue city, that they're bringing in smuggled illegals, they're using them, they're keeping them basically as slaves, and the Democrats are now using MS-13 and others who can infiltrate back and forth to the border as hitmen.
[02:55:40.137 --> 02:55:42.980]  And I've even been told, you better keep your mouth shut or we're going to send MS-13.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:43.981]  Well, go ahead and do it then.
[02:55:44.341 --> 02:55:54.310]  But I'm saying, folks, we are inches from collapsing to a lawless society like Mexico, and I think that's what you're saying as a police officer who says the problem's always been bad, but now it's exponential.
[02:55:54.991 --> 02:56:00.236]  Well, that's what I'm saying is, I love, I'm an American red, white, and blue all the way.
[02:56:00.476 --> 02:56:04.820]  But you know as well as I do, Alex, as a Texan, you have a special pride about you.
[02:56:05.485 --> 02:56:10.349]  And you think the state's alright even though the Republicans believe we're going to lose the state to blue within four years?
[02:56:10.890 --> 02:56:12.051]  Of course, and that's what I'm saying.
[02:56:12.071 --> 02:56:13.252]  I'm a proud Texan.
[02:56:13.312 --> 02:56:15.394]  I have family who fought and died at the Alamo.
[02:56:15.774 --> 02:56:17.515]  My blood runs deep in this state.
[02:56:17.936 --> 02:56:20.698]  And isn't it sad to see it falling apart like this?
[02:56:21.519 --> 02:56:28.705]  It kills me to see my kids look at their history books and look how just
[02:56:29.369 --> 02:56:30.410]  Much is left out.
[02:56:30.770 --> 02:56:38.654]  I take my kids every couple years to the Alamo, to San Jacinto, to different historical sites in this great state, to teach them what the real history is.
[02:56:38.674 --> 02:56:41.656]  Did you know the left has announced they're taking control of San Jacinto and the Alamo?
[02:56:41.676 --> 02:56:42.857]  They're going to put leftist crap up?
[02:56:43.717 --> 02:56:45.218]  It infuriates me.
[02:56:45.278 --> 02:56:51.302]  We've made a trip to the Alamo every year for the last four years almost, just because of what may happen.
[02:56:51.322 --> 02:56:52.382]  And this is what I'm trying to tell you.
[02:56:52.402 --> 02:56:56.605]  Oh, they've announced they're going to say Santa Ana, even though he's a dictator and hated, they're going to announce he was a good guy.
[02:56:57.711 --> 02:57:01.739]  Oh yeah, well tell that to my ancestors who got put on their knees and killed like dogs.
[02:57:01.759 --> 02:57:08.253]  Well I'll tell you the good news here is everybody knows the media is liars and so most folks, whatever the media is saying, they believe the opposite.
[02:57:09.215 --> 02:57:14.720]  And that's what I'm saying is, we're Texans, we're proud, we're God-fearing, and we will fight.
[02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:16.542]  I've heard you say this multiple times.
[02:57:16.962 --> 02:57:21.366]  I was at one of your rallies a few years ago in front of the Alamo, where you were talking about gun rights.
[02:57:21.386 --> 02:57:23.248]  I don't even remember when that was, but I was there.
[02:57:23.268 --> 02:57:27.171]  That was the first authorized political speech since the Alamo reopened 50 years ago.
[02:57:27.191 --> 02:57:30.254]  The land commissioner did it, and we laid it all out.
[02:57:30.274 --> 02:57:31.515]  That was powerful, that was special.
[02:57:31.555 --> 02:57:32.676]  Thank you so much, and God bless.
[02:57:33.217 --> 02:57:34.177]  Yeah, it's bad, folks.
[02:57:35.058 --> 02:57:44.863]  We're the happy hunting ground for MS-13 and drug gangs from Latin America, and they're coming up here and using the illegal alien population to hide in, and they're oppressing those people.
[02:57:45.463 --> 02:57:47.204]  And the Democrats are heavily involved.
[02:57:47.244 --> 02:57:48.344]  They've made their deal.
[02:57:48.364 --> 02:57:49.445]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:49.465 --> 02:57:49.885]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.446 --> 02:57:55.468]  Now to a dire warning about climate change.
[02:57:56.957 --> 02:57:57.839]  A dire warning.
[02:57:57.859 --> 02:57:58.560]  A dire warning.
[02:57:58.580 --> 02:57:59.401]  A dire warning.
[02:57:59.441 --> 02:58:00.262]  Dire new warning.
[02:58:00.282 --> 02:58:01.084]  Dire warning.
[02:58:01.164 --> 02:58:02.165]  Another dire warning.
[02:58:02.185 --> 02:58:03.547]  The situation is dire.
[02:58:04.028 --> 02:58:04.909]  A dire warning.
[02:58:04.929 --> 02:58:06.131]  Dire consequences.
[02:58:06.171 --> 02:58:07.253]  A dire warning.
[02:58:07.293 --> 02:58:08.194]  It sounds dire.
[02:58:08.255 --> 02:58:09.617]  What prompted this warning?
[02:58:09.677 --> 02:58:11.540]  We have a global emergency.
[02:58:13.044 --> 02:58:17.326]  It's here, it's man-made, and there are going to be dire results.
[02:58:17.387 --> 02:58:23.470]  The government issued its most dramatic report yet about climate change today, and it came with a dire warning.
[02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:24.571]  A stark warning.
[02:58:24.671 --> 02:58:26.672]  A warning to humanity.
[02:58:26.732 --> 02:58:30.494]  An existential threat to human civilization on this planet.
[02:58:30.634 --> 02:58:34.456]  Experts say that we have until 2030 to avoid catastrophe.
[02:58:34.596 --> 02:58:40.179]  And we, the scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[02:58:40.199 --> 02:58:42.641]  12 years in which to act.
[02:58:44.542 --> 02:58:47.725]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[02:58:47.785 --> 02:58:50.367]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[02:58:50.547 --> 02:58:53.569]  By the year 2030, that's just 12 years from now.
[02:58:53.629 --> 02:58:56.731]  The future is closer than we think and is not good.
[02:58:56.872 --> 02:58:59.253]  There will be irreversible damage to the planet.
[02:59:00.274 --> 02:59:04.576]  ...is running out to prevent global warming from reaching a catastrophic milestone.
[02:59:04.616 --> 02:59:05.856]  Sea levels rising.
[02:59:05.896 --> 02:59:06.556]  Extreme drought.
[02:59:06.596 --> 02:59:07.577]  Severe storms.
[02:59:07.637 --> 02:59:10.218]  Widespread fires and extreme flooding.
[02:59:10.318 --> 02:59:11.538]  Dangerous heat waves.
[02:59:11.658 --> 02:59:14.779]  Rising sea levels and forcing millions from their homes.
[02:59:14.979 --> 02:59:17.380]  Crop failure and mass population movements.
[02:59:17.400 --> 02:59:18.541]  As well as food shortages.
[02:59:18.621 --> 02:59:21.422]  Millions around the world face future disaster.
[02:59:21.602 --> 02:59:22.202]  Pretty serious.
[02:59:22.242 --> 02:59:23.322]  People are dying.
[02:59:23.362 --> 02:59:27.004]  President Trump has frequently doubted its existence and has called it a hoax.
[02:59:27.144 --> 02:59:27.744]  I don't believe it.
[02:59:29.824 --> 02:59:31.565]  The world is gonna end in 12 years.
[02:59:32.766 --> 02:59:40.570]  From the creators of the Russian Collusion Conspiracy and the Jussie Smollett hate crime, this summer, be afraid.
[02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:42.951]  Be very afraid.
[02:59:43.211 --> 02:59:44.892]  Like, this is the war.
[02:59:44.912 --> 02:59:46.213]  This is our World War II.
[02:59:46.413 --> 02:59:48.234]  Countdown to Apocalypse 2030.
[02:59:48.614 --> 02:59:51.556]  We're all gonna die.
[02:59:56.582 --> 03:00:00.534]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:16.467 --> 03:00:32.501]  John Irving's got some big news on the attempt to create a religious race war in this country coming up.
[03:00:33.241 --> 03:00:35.743]  Taking your phone calls right now in this segment.
[03:00:36.224 --> 03:00:37.825]  We'll get some more of your calls as we get to him.
[03:00:37.845 --> 03:00:41.008]  But this is important information he's going to premiere here for you.
[03:00:43.450 --> 03:00:44.931]  Right now we've got still loaded calls.
[03:00:45.011 --> 03:00:45.651]  It's hard to get to everybody.
[03:00:45.671 --> 03:00:46.532]  They're all such good callers.
[03:00:46.992 --> 03:00:48.593]  Greg in Dallas, thanks for holding.
[03:00:48.613 --> 03:00:49.614]  I really appreciate you.
[03:00:50.434 --> 03:00:53.836]  What is your take on this attempt to break our border and this whole operation?
[03:00:53.856 --> 03:00:56.458]  Alex, we need to take out the bridges.
[03:00:57.379 --> 03:01:10.707]  From Guatemala up to Chiapas, all those secondary roads down there, one night Trump sends the B-2s, secret mission, just takes out the bridges, takes out the roads.
[03:01:11.767 --> 03:01:23.594]  Well, you know, I'm not for preemptive war, but actually when the UN and others organize to collapse our borders and to organize these refugee centers and do this, that would be constitutional.
[03:01:23.715 --> 03:01:24.495]  Here's the problem.
[03:01:25.115 --> 03:01:32.860]  You need to cut the UN funding to USAID that's doing it and need to indict the Democrats involved in all this, which Trump's starting to do.
[03:01:33.381 --> 03:01:34.881]  So I really think before we have the
[03:01:35.930 --> 03:01:45.136]  I think before we have the B-1 bombers or the B-2 bombers drop smart bombs on the bridges down there, I think we should simply cut the head off a snake and cut the U.N.
[03:01:45.196 --> 03:01:45.517]  funding.
[03:01:45.817 --> 03:01:47.218]  Something Trump says he's getting ready to do.
[03:01:47.238 --> 03:01:48.479]  He says he's pulling out of the U.N.
[03:01:48.819 --> 03:01:49.580]  small-arms treaty.
[03:01:51.441 --> 03:01:52.422]  No, I agree.
[03:01:52.502 --> 03:01:54.203]  I think we should do that.
[03:01:54.603 --> 03:01:59.947]  And I think, I don't know if he's spying on these traitors Democrats right now,
[03:02:01.029 --> 03:02:01.610]  He should be.
[03:02:01.630 --> 03:02:02.411]  Yeah.
[03:02:18.578 --> 03:02:24.687]  Well, if there's evidence against them, I mean, we ought to have the military grabbing them in the middle of the night, shoving their butts down the bottom of the hole.
[03:02:24.707 --> 03:02:25.408]  Well, here's the problem.
[03:02:25.448 --> 03:02:26.389]  Then we become them.
[03:02:26.409 --> 03:02:30.936]  I think we expose them, we openly charge them, and we do it in the open daylight.
[03:02:30.976 --> 03:02:31.737]  But I appreciate your call.
[03:02:32.218 --> 03:02:33.339]  I understand your frustrations.
[03:02:34.565 --> 03:02:37.609]  They wanted to arrest everybody in the dead of night and all the rest of the crap the military wouldn't do it.
[03:02:38.069 --> 03:02:42.594]  Which is one thing that woke up the military was when they sort of drawn up a list under Obama to arrest me and others.
[03:02:43.095 --> 03:02:43.776]  That all came out.
[03:02:43.796 --> 03:02:50.964]  Listen, we're gonna win this thing as long as the people just stay focused and stay involved.
[03:02:50.984 --> 03:02:51.845]  Greg, I appreciate your call.
[03:02:52.925 --> 03:02:57.228]  But yeah, I mean, we could definitely... I don't want to go into Venezuela because the neocons will set Trump up.
[03:02:57.628 --> 03:03:00.230]  But constitutionally, it's organizing the collapse down there.
[03:03:00.730 --> 03:03:02.571]  And so we need to stabilize our borders, period.
[03:03:02.591 --> 03:03:03.952]  And that is in our sphere of influence.
[03:03:04.012 --> 03:03:06.994]  And we've invaded Central and South America before over crap like this.
[03:03:07.954 --> 03:03:09.515]  So we'll see what happens here.
[03:03:09.635 --> 03:03:10.856]  I'm taking a lot of calls here.
[03:03:10.876 --> 03:03:11.516]  Who's up next?
[03:03:13.077 --> 03:03:14.318]  James in California.
[03:03:14.338 --> 03:03:15.219]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:03:15.239 --> 03:03:15.599]  Go ahead.
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:17.760]  Hey, Alex.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:18.341]  How are you?
[03:03:18.601 --> 03:03:18.881]  I'm good.
[03:03:18.921 --> 03:03:19.221]  Go ahead.
[03:03:20.122 --> 03:03:20.282]  Hey.
[03:03:21.109 --> 03:03:21.369]  I don't know.
[03:03:21.389 --> 03:03:22.850]  I just kind of want to challenge you a little bit.
[03:03:23.271 --> 03:03:24.712]  I've been a long time listener.
[03:03:24.732 --> 03:03:28.855]  I started listening to you when you were on Dr. Stan Monteith's program.
[03:03:28.875 --> 03:03:29.195]  That's fine.
[03:03:29.215 --> 03:03:29.635]  Challenge me.
[03:03:29.655 --> 03:03:30.036]  Go ahead.
[03:03:31.136 --> 03:03:38.722]  Yeah, well, your latest product, you know, about don't California my Texas or don't California the U.S.
[03:03:38.802 --> 03:03:39.663]  or whatever that is.
[03:03:40.864 --> 03:03:41.704]  I take offense to it.
[03:03:42.084 --> 03:03:45.727]  I know there's some Patriots out here in California that probably do, too, because you know what?
[03:03:46.147 --> 03:03:47.048]  We're out here fighting.
[03:03:47.508 --> 03:03:49.390]  You know, we've been out here getting involved.
[03:03:50.066 --> 03:03:51.186]  With everything that we can.
[03:03:51.567 --> 03:03:56.029]  Well you know I say, I say in the video that it's not like a sports team saying we're better than California.
[03:03:56.509 --> 03:03:59.250]  I'm saying don't do to Texas what's been done to California.
[03:03:59.850 --> 03:04:02.391]  It's to wake people up around the country about what the left does.
[03:04:02.471 --> 03:04:03.432]  I think it's very clear.
[03:04:03.452 --> 03:04:04.352]  Alex.
[03:04:04.752 --> 03:04:07.673]  The ad I even cut says California's got a lot of great people and a great history.
[03:04:07.733 --> 03:04:09.034]  I just don't think that's fair.
[03:04:09.754 --> 03:04:15.637]  Listen, I totally respect you but I think you're on the wrong end of this thing because you keep talking about unity.
[03:04:16.277 --> 03:04:18.478]  You keep talking, you just said it like in the last segment.
[03:04:18.942 --> 03:04:21.784]  You broke into it saying, you know, I'm all for unity.
[03:04:22.624 --> 03:04:23.545]  We've got to have unity.
[03:04:24.125 --> 03:04:32.730]  Well, how united are we when we're just going to toss a state out and just let it... I think we need to recognize that California is enemy-held territory at this point.
[03:04:33.430 --> 03:04:39.434]  I don't think they arrest you if you don't say the right pronoun for this imaginary other gender.
[03:04:39.574 --> 03:04:42.356]  I mean, I think we need to admit it's occupied territory.
[03:04:43.856 --> 03:04:46.378]  How about shirts that say, Save California?
[03:04:48.174 --> 03:04:51.296]  Or is that an insult to say California's up the creek without a paddle?
[03:04:51.636 --> 03:04:52.236]  I just don't know.
[03:04:53.076 --> 03:04:54.057]  I got a guest coming up.
[03:04:54.077 --> 03:04:55.097]  I'm going to pop back to you.
[03:04:55.137 --> 03:04:55.978]  He lives out in California.
[03:04:56.018 --> 03:04:56.818]  Let's get his take on it.
[03:04:57.258 --> 03:04:57.579]  Stay there.
[03:04:57.599 --> 03:04:58.279]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:58.319 --> 03:04:58.899]  Stay there, James.
[03:04:59.459 --> 03:05:00.300]  InfoWars.com.
[03:05:06.909 --> 03:05:07.890]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[03:05:07.930 --> 03:05:10.051]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[03:05:10.071 --> 03:05:10.672]  What's your view?
[03:05:10.712 --> 03:05:11.332]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:05:11.412 --> 03:05:12.493]  I appreciate you having me on.
[03:05:12.553 --> 03:05:14.314]  First off, I wanted to thank you for the body.
[03:05:14.354 --> 03:05:25.682]  You've been using it for a while, but I sent a bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[03:05:25.702 --> 03:05:26.623]  She was ecstatic.
[03:05:26.663 --> 03:05:33.287]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[03:05:33.447 --> 03:05:34.008]  Turmeric.
[03:05:34.867 --> 03:05:37.649]  Curry in India is powerful.
[03:05:37.689 --> 03:05:39.931]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[03:05:40.031 --> 03:05:40.391]  Ours is 95%.
[03:05:40.431 --> 03:05:43.393]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[03:05:44.014 --> 03:05:46.695]  So, Advil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[03:05:47.056 --> 03:05:50.458]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[03:05:51.039 --> 03:05:52.960]  So that's why Bodies is so incredible.
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.322]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.
[03:05:55.342 --> 03:05:58.744]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because Bodies is amazing.
[03:05:58.864 --> 03:05:59.645]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:06:04.767 --> 03:06:07.429]  Frontlines of the Information War.
[03:06:07.989 --> 03:06:09.430]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:17.215 --> 03:06:21.378]  Alright, Jan Irvin is a smart guy, an author, researcher, podcaster.
[03:06:22.018 --> 03:06:25.560]  We've had him on about the dangers of marijuana, triggering schizophrenia.
[03:06:26.161 --> 03:06:27.562]  Even Joe Rogan's been talking about it now.
[03:06:27.582 --> 03:06:28.782]  We've had him on about DMT.
[03:06:30.769 --> 03:06:43.393]  Last time he was on, we talked about the CIA, from the evidence I had, mapping using basically the equivalent of interdimensional astronauts, believing they were going in with IV drips and mapping these other dimensions.
[03:06:43.433 --> 03:06:50.136]  Well, that came out in mainstream news that major universities are now doing public programs to send in what they call interdimensional
[03:06:50.876 --> 03:06:53.498]  Cosmonauts, basically, to map other dimensions.
[03:06:53.778 --> 03:06:55.039]  Doesn't mean I believe all this.
[03:06:55.679 --> 03:06:57.440]  This is what the establishment's into.
[03:06:57.960 --> 03:06:58.781]  This is what they're up to.
[03:06:58.821 --> 03:07:00.622]  We'll also continue with at least H.B.
[03:07:00.642 --> 03:07:03.423]  Scott, Paul, Kevin and James and Leonard and Jaron.
[03:07:03.664 --> 03:07:05.385]  Try to get to all of you before the war room starts.
[03:07:06.005 --> 03:07:11.208]  And then we'll have Jan Urban on again soon to get into more of his findings.
[03:07:11.848 --> 03:07:17.592]  But the reason he joins us now is he's a Christian writer and researcher, and he's going to publish findings on this soon.
[03:07:17.612 --> 03:07:19.373]  We're going to get into all the meat and potatoes of it today.
[03:07:20.879 --> 03:07:25.062]  But he has an article, The Terrible Talmud Debunked.
[03:07:26.523 --> 03:07:29.505]  And here's a big paper, April 2019, getting into this.
[03:07:29.525 --> 03:07:34.748]  He's found leftist groups are funding a lot of the anti-Semitism.
[03:07:34.768 --> 03:07:36.630]  And I don't care.
[03:07:37.875 --> 03:07:47.125]  You have the mentally ill Nazis in people that are Soros-funded most of the time and ADL-funded, Media Matters-funded, and to come out, Southern Poverty Law Center-funded, especially that group.
[03:07:47.646 --> 03:07:49.227]  I'm not trying to curry favor with you guys.
[03:07:49.668 --> 03:07:50.008]  I get it.
[03:07:50.068 --> 03:07:56.816]  You say somebody's a Jewish agent, it makes you all high and powerful, and you're the pure people, and you know, it's total crap.
[03:07:57.952 --> 03:07:59.233]  Total mental illness, total crap.
[03:07:59.894 --> 03:08:01.074]  Israel's a diverse country.
[03:08:01.375 --> 03:08:05.398]  It staged terror attacks, the Levant Affair, you know, to do things.
[03:08:05.458 --> 03:08:07.580]  Israel's had bad leaders, good leaders, just like the U.S.
[03:08:08.060 --> 03:08:09.021]  But I'm not anti-Israel.
[03:08:10.342 --> 03:08:12.603]  And it's not because I get anything from Israel.
[03:08:13.744 --> 03:08:21.090]  In fact, 90%, if you wanted to say, of Jewish organizations that I've found are mainly liberal, and I've had them attack me, try to get me off the air.
[03:08:21.130 --> 03:08:22.391]  But I don't blame Jews for that.
[03:08:22.431 --> 03:08:23.332]  I blame leftists for that.
[03:08:24.616 --> 03:08:27.438]  But I am one of the most attacked people by Jew-bashers out there.
[03:08:28.438 --> 03:08:29.399]  They say that I'm Jewish.
[03:08:29.419 --> 03:08:29.859]  Well, I'm not.
[03:08:29.899 --> 03:08:31.720]  If I was, I'd be proud of it and would tell you that.
[03:08:33.461 --> 03:08:34.641]  But it really is a mental illness.
[03:08:35.302 --> 03:08:37.943]  And then I noticed the combat vet who stopped the synagogue shooter.
[03:08:38.063 --> 03:08:39.984]  I scared the hell out of him.
[03:08:40.024 --> 03:08:44.166]  The shooter comes in, shoots three people, kills one, shoots four people, wounds three, kills one.
[03:08:44.547 --> 03:08:47.949]  This fellow, army veteran, charges him down, pins him in his car.
[03:08:48.529 --> 03:08:52.031]  Then a Border Patrol individual who was off duty found somebody else's gun.
[03:08:53.277 --> 03:08:55.518]  Went and apprehended the guy before he could kill more people.
[03:08:56.259 --> 03:08:59.961]  And I just, you know, saw the YouTube comments about how, you know, wish they'd have gotten more.
[03:09:00.381 --> 03:09:01.322]  This is just sick.
[03:09:02.262 --> 03:09:05.384]  And I guess you, you, you, you Nazis join Islam.
[03:09:05.404 --> 03:09:08.866]  Notice when I bash radical Islam, the white supremacists come out and attack me.
[03:09:09.787 --> 03:09:18.051]  Because, you know, I'm a Jewish agent because I don't like Islam with, what is it, like 1.8 billion people?
[03:09:18.071 --> 03:09:18.952]  It's about to be 3 billion.
[03:09:20.629 --> 03:09:28.214]  So that's the whole background here, and then AOC won't tweet about dead Christians in Sri Lanka, but she'll tweet about dead Muslims.
[03:09:28.254 --> 03:09:30.876]  I'm not against Muslims in general, but they're protected.
[03:09:31.577 --> 03:09:35.580]  And so, and this fetish about Israel, I barely think about Israel, I'm not involved with Israel.
[03:09:36.320 --> 03:09:38.001]  But then this obsession with it.
[03:09:38.522 --> 03:09:46.328]  Jan has done some research into the billionaire that does all these ads against Trump and Lepa's groups and I've confirmed the left is the main pusher.
[03:09:46.348 --> 03:09:58.778]  In fact, we've seen IP addresses back when we ran our own comments where you'll have Lepa's groups, going back to Lepa's foundations, posing as Nazis and posing as liberals, all creating a race diatribe just like WikiLeaks shows the Democrats are doing.
[03:09:58.798 --> 03:10:03.241]  So Jan's looked into all this and some of the new stuff that's coming and
[03:10:04.548 --> 03:10:09.313]  Massive Islamic expansion attacks on churches is now just being dubbed as religious violence.
[03:10:09.714 --> 03:10:14.679]  So Jan at LogosMedia.com and TriviumEducation.com, thanks for joining us.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:17.041]  Thanks for having me back, Alex.
[03:10:17.662 --> 03:10:24.049]  So what's a way to quantify and just recap, because I agree with your research, I haven't gotten to the whole article on air or your new stuff's about to be published.
[03:10:25.342 --> 03:10:26.723]  I mean, what's this dialectic?
[03:10:26.763 --> 03:10:27.603]  What's going on here?
[03:10:27.643 --> 03:10:40.107]  Because clearly, David Duke is on YouTube, all these other people that say Hitler did a great job, like Owen Benjamin until recently wasn't saying stuff like that.
[03:10:40.527 --> 03:10:42.268]  He seems to have gone crazy.
[03:10:42.888 --> 03:10:44.948]  But what is going on here?
[03:10:45.088 --> 03:10:46.509]  I mean, what's really happening?
[03:10:47.281 --> 03:10:54.825]  Well, in my opinion, it's a dialectic, and they are trying to, you know, and I've taken a lot of flak already for exposing this.
[03:10:54.865 --> 03:10:56.506]  I've been doing a series on my show.
[03:10:56.526 --> 03:11:00.869]  You just showed one of the images with Lloyd DeJong doing a series.
[03:11:00.949 --> 03:11:09.894]  First, we did a seven-part series exposing Islam, and then people were requesting that we go into Judaism, so we started investigating that.
[03:11:10.695 --> 03:11:15.357]  The first show was on the Noahide Laws, how it's supposedly a conspiracy.
[03:11:15.397 --> 03:11:16.378]  We refuted that.
[03:11:16.918 --> 03:11:22.221]  And we started just going through the Torah, and then we began to go into the Talmud.
[03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:33.774]  And so for decades, if not since the 1890s, there's been a number of quotes floating around that are claimed to be from the Talmud.
[03:11:33.814 --> 03:11:43.158]  Like, let me just give you an example, whoever disobeys the rabbis deserves death and will be punished by being boiled in hot excrement in hell.
[03:11:43.558 --> 03:11:48.901]  And so we started going through the Talmud and fact-checking all of these and we were
[03:11:49.759 --> 03:11:49.919]  I think?
[03:12:05.828 --> 03:12:06.588]  Any of this stuff.
[03:12:06.628 --> 03:12:13.072]  In fact, I took a lot of flack for coming on your show back in January and was called to show I did not sell out to you.
[03:12:13.132 --> 03:12:14.192]  You've paid me nothing.
[03:12:14.673 --> 03:12:18.935]  You simply gave me a platform to reach a wider audience, which I appreciate.
[03:12:19.375 --> 03:12:24.037]  Yeah, they run around like the thought police saying who can talk to who and that's what I'm sick of.
[03:12:24.578 --> 03:12:25.298]  It's all made up.
[03:12:26.075 --> 03:12:27.316]  Yep, exactly it is.
[03:12:27.396 --> 03:12:36.320]  So, we started going through and exposing these Talmud quotes as false and, you know, we were dissented on by
[03:12:37.795 --> 03:12:43.701]  Clearly orchestrated and organized shills by the many dozens, hundreds who were on.
[03:12:43.821 --> 03:12:44.561]  And let's go further.
[03:12:44.702 --> 03:12:46.363]  You then lost your live streaming.
[03:12:46.823 --> 03:12:48.585]  You got banned, just like we get banned.
[03:12:48.925 --> 03:12:51.247]  And I'm not saying take away David Duke's thing or Owen Benjamin.
[03:12:51.468 --> 03:12:55.831]  But Owen Benjamin has said Hitler was a great leader in Germany.
[03:12:55.952 --> 03:12:56.912]  Okay, he has a right to say that.
[03:12:56.932 --> 03:12:57.513]  I disagree with it.
[03:12:58.013 --> 03:12:59.275]  I'm banned on YouTube.
[03:12:59.755 --> 03:13:00.556]  I mean, it's like...
[03:13:02.009 --> 03:13:06.711]  Well, they shut down my live stream just for coming on your show.
[03:13:07.152 --> 03:13:09.653]  I managed to get it back on after a month and a half.
[03:13:10.433 --> 03:13:12.394]  But, you know, that impacted me.
[03:13:12.434 --> 03:13:18.757]  In fact, if there's any angels in your audience, please go to Logos Media and support the show because we do run on donations and always have.
[03:13:19.598 --> 03:13:20.999]  You've gone through a lot of hell here.
[03:13:21.259 --> 03:13:29.823]  Why do you think leftist anti-Semitism, and people have the right to free speech, why is that all allowed to operate but we aren't?
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:32.501]  Well, you know, here's the thing.
[03:13:32.641 --> 03:13:35.783]  We're starting to think that it's crypto-Islamicism.
[03:13:37.104 --> 03:13:40.706]  You can look it up on Wikipedia and the dictionary wherever.
[03:13:41.407 --> 03:13:43.348]  Baphomet actually means Mohammed.
[03:13:44.048 --> 03:13:49.732]  And we started making all of these connections and the research and realizing that there was a bait and switch going on here.
[03:13:50.362 --> 03:13:54.524]  And so, you know, there's the old saying, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
[03:13:55.125 --> 03:14:00.507]  And so, if they can get the Christians to kill the Jews, who benefits by that?
[03:14:00.567 --> 03:14:01.268]  Kay Bono.
[03:14:01.748 --> 03:14:12.814]  And, you know, all of the things that we that were told are true about the Talmud and this whole quote-unquote Talmudic conspiracy, we found true in Islam.
[03:14:13.394 --> 03:14:15.775]  And we didn't find in the Talmud.
[03:14:16.055 --> 03:14:23.757]  And we were going through the primary citations, showing them on screen, and no one would believe it.
[03:14:23.937 --> 03:14:33.580]  I've lost more friends and more people that I thought were allies for daring to speak the truth on this than anything I've ever covered since I started my show almost 11 years ago.
[03:14:34.960 --> 03:14:38.923]  Well, let's talk about that when we come back, because it doesn't mean Israel hasn't done bad things.
[03:14:38.943 --> 03:14:41.024]  It doesn't mean there aren't some bad news out there.
[03:14:41.044 --> 03:14:41.644]  Absolutely right.
[03:14:41.804 --> 03:14:44.566]  And I'm not defending Israel carte blanche either.
[03:14:44.926 --> 03:14:47.728]  What we're focused on is the primary religious documents.
[03:14:47.748 --> 03:14:48.949]  Sure, people are making up quotes.
[03:14:48.989 --> 03:14:49.870]  And what they say.
[03:14:51.130 --> 03:14:52.151]  But, I mean, here's the thing.
[03:14:52.171 --> 03:14:59.116]  And we're not criticizing Israel to curry favor with the mentally ill Israel-bashers that believe whatever bull they're told either.
[03:14:59.476 --> 03:15:00.897]  We're trying to really be truthful.
[03:15:02.230 --> 03:15:05.291]  Here on air, to really decide and figure out what's happening.
[03:15:05.311 --> 03:15:09.592]  It doesn't mean we both totally agree either, because it depends on which side of the bed I get up.
[03:15:09.672 --> 03:15:11.193]  I'm trying to figure all this out.
[03:15:11.373 --> 03:15:16.314]  All I know is, is that people bashing Israel are left alone now.
[03:15:16.994 --> 03:15:20.576]  And those of us that are neutral on it or pro-Israel are being censored.
[03:15:20.596 --> 03:15:21.796]  But I just want to explain this when we come back.
[03:15:23.092 --> 03:15:25.774]  It came out in the WikiLeaks that George Soros wants to get rid of Israel.
[03:15:26.455 --> 03:15:29.177]  The Rothschilds are wanting to broker this big deal.
[03:15:29.197 --> 03:15:30.719]  People say, well, hey, they helped set up Israel.
[03:15:31.059 --> 03:15:32.280]  That's the dialectic.
[03:15:32.340 --> 03:15:34.742]  It was put there to create this explosion.
[03:15:35.443 --> 03:15:36.824]  And then I said, well, look at Netanyahu.
[03:15:37.205 --> 03:15:38.606]  The Economist is on with the Rothschilds.
[03:15:38.646 --> 03:15:39.266]  They want him out.
[03:15:39.286 --> 03:15:40.247]  People go, oh, yeah, right.
[03:15:40.287 --> 03:15:41.488]  Netanyahu's a Rothschild agent.
[03:15:41.849 --> 03:15:42.389]  No, he's not.
[03:15:42.649 --> 03:15:43.730]  I'm not defending Netanyahu.
[03:15:44.511 --> 03:15:45.772]  But he's different.
[03:15:45.812 --> 03:15:46.612]  He's a nationalist.
[03:15:46.652 --> 03:15:50.035]  So, we're going to talk about this with Jan Ervin.
[03:15:50.435 --> 03:15:54.838]  On the other side, LogosMedia.com, AlexJonesWithInfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com.
[03:15:55.158 --> 03:15:56.819]  This is real open discussion.
[03:15:56.899 --> 03:16:00.382]  Not ideology, but figuring out what's really going on.
[03:16:03.216 --> 03:16:06.438]  The globalists are hammering humanity with bad halogens.
[03:16:06.898 --> 03:16:08.198]  Fluoride being chief amongst them.
[03:16:08.638 --> 03:16:13.600]  Well, all they try to keep the one good halogen out of the food supply, and that's iodine.
[03:16:13.820 --> 03:16:16.421]  But most iodine isn't pure, so you can't absorb it.
[03:16:16.621 --> 03:16:17.121]  Well, guess what?
[03:16:17.241 --> 03:16:19.362]  X2's back in stock, and it's discounted.
[03:16:19.382 --> 03:16:24.164]  And when you get a bottle of the original X2, you get a free bottle of X3 to see how amazing it is.
[03:16:24.664 --> 03:16:26.805]  Only at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:16:27.225 --> 03:16:28.185]  Now, stay with us.
[03:16:28.305 --> 03:16:30.126]  I'll break down the latest developments.
[03:16:42.989 --> 03:16:44.209]  There is a war.
[03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:45.769]  It's happening now.
[03:16:46.369 --> 03:16:48.390]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:50.751]  The time to choose sides has come.
[03:16:51.511 --> 03:16:52.991]  We are the resistance.
[03:16:53.431 --> 03:16:55.012]  We are the Infowar.
[03:17:01.869 --> 03:17:06.074]  There are a lot of people out there that say they're on the front lines of the fight for liberty.
[03:17:06.855 --> 03:17:07.355]  And some are.
[03:17:08.897 --> 03:17:10.559]  But I'm not doing this to be famous.
[03:17:10.619 --> 03:17:12.261]  I'm doing this because it was the right thing to do.
[03:17:12.321 --> 03:17:14.804]  And let me tell you, I've gotten deep into this fight.
[03:17:15.585 --> 03:17:18.989]  And I've got the globalists pulling out every stop and every dirty trick you can imagine.
[03:17:19.716 --> 03:17:31.886]  But because you've stood with them full wars, because you've spread the word, and because you've bought the products we sell that fund our operations, we are here in the face of the globalist tyranny being more aggressive and more effective than ever.
[03:17:32.587 --> 03:17:33.628]  I just went to D.C.
[03:17:33.708 --> 03:17:38.752]  and bullhorned the president while Jack Dorsey was inside lying, saying they don't censor conservatives.
[03:17:39.353 --> 03:17:42.715]  Ilhan Omar is calling for Trump to be banned, for God's sakes.
[03:17:43.416 --> 03:17:44.297]  And we were in D.C.
[03:17:44.337 --> 03:17:52.324]  doing dozens of major interviews and really affecting change and getting the president to go after the deep state with criminal charges, which you heard about years ago.
[03:17:52.344 --> 03:17:54.666]  And now the president's finally getting ready to do it.
[03:17:55.367 --> 03:17:56.848]  We are the real change agents.
[03:17:56.948 --> 03:17:59.150]  We are effective because we tell the truth.
[03:17:59.811 --> 03:18:02.974]  But without you backing us, we won't be here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:03.494 --> 03:18:06.998]  Without you supporting us, the globalists will be able to shut us down.
[03:18:08.382 --> 03:18:13.544]  Please understand that my philosophy is to give you the very best information out there.
[03:18:14.244 --> 03:18:17.705]  And my philosophy with products we sell to fund ourselves is very simple.
[03:18:18.406 --> 03:18:27.329]  Sell the highest quality that I, myself, and my family take, give it to you at a great price, so that it's a win-win, so you continue to want to come back and get it over and over again.
[03:18:27.929 --> 03:18:31.410]  We're running two new specials for one week and one week only.
[03:18:32.410 --> 03:18:33.491]  The biggest one ever is
[03:18:34.950 --> 03:18:36.630]  X2, we were able to get back in stock.
[03:18:36.811 --> 03:18:38.271]  Deep Earth pure iodine crystals.
[03:18:39.091 --> 03:18:42.332]  Read about iodine deficiency, how it has lower IQs, you don't have it.
[03:18:42.752 --> 03:18:45.273]  Boosted IQs, how it's the building block of the whole body.
[03:18:45.813 --> 03:18:47.513]  Just as essential as water or oxygen.
[03:18:47.833 --> 03:18:50.314]  We have the true pure iodine that you can absorb.
[03:18:50.994 --> 03:18:52.374]  About 98% of people can.
[03:18:53.355 --> 03:18:55.595]  And it's just a game changer.
[03:18:55.935 --> 03:18:56.855]  We have it back in stock.
[03:18:56.915 --> 03:18:59.496]  And when you get one bottle of X2, already 25% off.
[03:19:00.196 --> 03:19:01.076]  Already a great deal.
[03:19:04.028 --> 03:19:07.469]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[03:19:08.049 --> 03:19:08.869]  Absolutely free.
[03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:13.351]  Now, we sat out with top scientists and said, could we make X2 better?
[03:19:13.411 --> 03:19:14.731]  This has the deep-earth crystals in it.
[03:19:14.811 --> 03:19:15.271]  X3 does.
[03:19:15.551 --> 03:19:16.391]  And they said, yes.
[03:19:17.072 --> 03:19:23.393]  You'd have the other two types of iodine in there because a low percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[03:19:23.793 --> 03:19:25.534]  Just like most people can't absorb
[03:19:26.514 --> 03:19:28.315]  Iodine that isn't atomic.
[03:19:28.775 --> 03:19:30.036]  So again, it's a catch-22.
[03:19:30.536 --> 03:19:32.296]  So we created X3.
[03:19:32.777 --> 03:19:39.019]  Now X3 is weaker on purpose, because again, some people can't handle the strongest iodine.
[03:19:39.339 --> 03:19:42.841]  Consult your physician before you take it, because this is real stuff.
[03:19:43.681 --> 03:19:49.323]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, get a bottle of X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:49.803 --> 03:19:57.246]  Incredibly popular, thousands of five-star reviews, and get a free bottle of X3 so you can experience how amazing it is as well.
[03:19:57.666 --> 03:20:00.948]  InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:20:01.408 --> 03:20:02.568]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:20:06.250 --> 03:20:08.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.284 --> 03:20:24.370]  John Irvin is a researcher, author, successful podcaster.
[03:20:38.946 --> 03:20:44.599]  And, you know, I love how he adds a proviso, I didn't meet with Alex before this and I'm not on his payroll.
[03:20:45.381 --> 03:20:49.169]  Saying all that only intensifies the schizophrenics out there.
[03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:53.122]  I don't care what the Nazis or people think about me.
[03:20:53.763 --> 03:20:55.685]  Everything I cover is on the record.
[03:20:56.425 --> 03:20:57.606]  People know what I stand for.
[03:20:57.646 --> 03:20:59.407]  Let's just cover the facts here, okay?
[03:20:59.928 --> 03:21:06.833]  And I'm not getting on to you, Jan, but I've told people that respond to critics, it just makes it worse, so just who cares?
[03:21:07.634 --> 03:21:13.098]  I only raise things sometimes about critics if, which I know you're doing, if it doesn't make sense.
[03:21:13.619 --> 03:21:18.143]  Like you're saying, you went and looked into these supposed Jewish holy books,
[03:21:18.843 --> 03:21:19.023]  Let's
[03:21:39.502 --> 03:21:48.326]  Last week, and I had some groups of Orthodox or Hasidic Jews coming up wanting to give me hugs, and others on video running up and saying, why don't you like Trump?
[03:21:48.366 --> 03:21:49.307]  You know, you're a bad person.
[03:21:50.227 --> 03:21:51.908]  And I think we were part of the same group.
[03:21:52.568 --> 03:21:54.790]  And I was saying to the guy, you know, you're not stupid, are you?
[03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:56.991]  You know I'm bullying him to get something done, right?
[03:21:57.891 --> 03:22:02.353]  And again, it's like saying, I'm not for Baptists or I'm against them.
[03:22:02.473 --> 03:22:03.573]  There's all sorts of people in there.
[03:22:04.254 --> 03:22:10.096]  So, here's my bottom line, I don't want your bottom line, then we'll get into the latest shooting at the synagogue and the rest of it and the media response.
[03:22:12.457 --> 03:22:13.517]  It's smolleting.
[03:22:13.797 --> 03:22:25.802]  The ADL has been caught before, but the Southern Poverty Law Center particularly, funding white supremacist groups, funding the leaders to go out and find low IQ people to go do marches and things, to get more funding to their groups.
[03:22:26.582 --> 03:22:36.615]  Okay, so it's just Jesse Smollett on a bigger scale, and that's why they're bringing him back to the show, and he's being called a hero now, like Brian Williams got brought back to NBC after being caught lying about being shot down in a helicopter.
[03:22:38.056 --> 03:22:39.658]  And so, Smollett did what he was supposed to.
[03:22:40.639 --> 03:22:44.765]  And so, you know, if you can say there's a Sephardic Jewish look,
[03:22:46.138 --> 03:22:50.981]  This has come out in the news before, you know, kind of like Seinfeld looks like an Ashkenazi Jew.
[03:22:51.882 --> 03:22:59.567]  I've gone and protested the KKK in Austin, and I made the point years ago, and we could find the video, you'd see it, the leaders looked like it was a Seinfeld reunion.
[03:22:59.647 --> 03:23:03.070]  And then, of course, they were leftists, you know, doing that, and we know that goes on.
[03:23:03.130 --> 03:23:06.272]  So there are leftist Jews, but other leftists,
[03:23:06.972 --> 03:23:24.739]  Clearly exacerbating through bots and things this anti-semitic garbage to then try to tie it to any nationalism or conservatism to discredit it while also creating a giant field of racists they can then use against the nationalists who would be like Martin Luther King or myself who would try to unify people around shared values.
[03:23:25.139 --> 03:23:30.822]  And so I just think it's classic divide and conquer like Hillary talks about in the WikiLeaks and I think that's why true people that want
[03:23:31.642 --> 03:23:34.723]  Unification around freedom, but still having our individual liberty.
[03:23:34.743 --> 03:23:36.704]  I think that's why we're target number one.
[03:23:36.724 --> 03:23:37.164]  What do you think?
[03:23:38.144 --> 03:23:39.544]  I think you're exactly right.
[03:23:39.624 --> 03:23:49.828]  And what they do is they have this group online called the GDL or Goyim Defense League, who goes around calling for death to Jews, death to gays, etc.
[03:23:50.428 --> 03:23:57.690]  And then, you know, they spread all of these, this hate, and they inundate your chats on your on your live streams.
[03:23:57.750 --> 03:24:00.711]  They inundate the comments on your videos, etc.
[03:24:01.824 --> 03:24:14.070]  And then, you know, in my opinion, it looks like they're trying to get free speech shut down so that when, you know, if somebody says, why should we shut down free speech?
[03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:25.076]  They can point at this GDL group who spreads all of this hate everywhere and then blame people like myself or, you know, anyone else who happens to be Christian or whatever.
[03:24:25.976 --> 03:24:31.902]  For this hate being spread around by this GDL group, which is very coordinated.
[03:24:31.962 --> 03:24:33.563]  They appear very well funded.
[03:24:34.224 --> 03:24:39.229]  And they just came out of the woodwork last July and August.
[03:24:39.309 --> 03:24:40.811]  I know you're involved in deep research.
[03:24:41.191 --> 03:24:43.193]  Are you ready to put out the findings of who's funding them?
[03:24:44.730 --> 03:24:46.591]  Well, you know, it's up to you.
[03:24:47.092 --> 03:24:54.937]  It appears, and I did a show with Halsley English last week, but if you want to mention it, you're free to do so.
[03:24:55.057 --> 03:24:56.758]  I wouldn't mention any names.
[03:24:56.878 --> 03:25:02.442]  When are you ready to publish the proof of the big famous billionaire who does all the stuff against Trump?
[03:25:02.642 --> 03:25:03.983]  I'm not ready to publish that.
[03:25:04.043 --> 03:25:05.104]  I don't have the proof yet.
[03:25:05.644 --> 03:25:09.987]  I got a lead from another journalist that I need to follow up on to get proof of that.
[03:25:10.767 --> 03:25:11.488]  Here's what we know.
[03:25:11.528 --> 03:25:14.570]  The left is funding hate groups, and they've been caught doing it.
[03:25:15.330 --> 03:25:15.551]  Yes.
[03:25:17.392 --> 03:25:39.408]  And they've also, you know, Halsley English has found, you know, a friend of his who's co-hosted on his show has found that they even, you know, hired his friend to put an actor in makeup and act like the governor of Virginia to go around and try to get, you know, the governor accused of BS before he was voted out.
[03:25:41.872 --> 03:25:50.799]  Well, I remember with Rand Paul, they had some of the Democrat employees, the guy running against him in the Senate, dressed up in hayseed outfits saying, we hate New Mexicans.
[03:25:50.839 --> 03:25:52.520]  I'm going to say it, because they'll edit it and say I said it.
[03:25:52.901 --> 03:25:59.306]  That's how deceptive they are that Trump can say a lot of good people on both sides in Virginia, but not the white supremacists.
[03:25:59.366 --> 03:26:01.888]  And then they edit it and say, he said, white supremacists are good.
[03:26:01.908 --> 03:26:07.132]  I mean, they're so deceptive now that we really can't even talk on air, or they'll edit it out of context.
[03:26:07.452 --> 03:26:09.333]  But at a certain point, you've got to let them edit it, you know?
[03:26:09.373 --> 03:26:09.914]  They're going to do it.
[03:26:10.905 --> 03:26:15.089]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of that too, where they just take what I say completely out of context.
[03:26:15.609 --> 03:26:20.053]  Yeah, you'll say like, this white supremacist leader said this, and then they'll say that you said that.
[03:26:21.014 --> 03:26:23.096]  Right, and then, you know, what they're trying to do is get...
[03:26:23.937 --> 03:26:32.745]  They're spreading all of this hate so that they get normal people that are low IQ to go out and do, like, the shooting in Poi San Diego this weekend at the synagogue.
[03:26:33.185 --> 03:26:35.327]  And then they'll turn and they'll blame Christians for that.
[03:26:35.727 --> 03:26:45.095]  And then when you ask who benefits of this, you know, getting Christianity accused of Nazism only benefits one group, and that's the Islamists.
[03:26:45.535 --> 03:26:52.061]  You know, so, you know, if, you know, I mean, all of these things that we've... Well, you said something fascinating, though.
[03:26:52.762 --> 03:26:57.688]  I noticed that when I criticize radical expansionist Islam, that's when the Nazis come out of the woodwork.
[03:26:58.229 --> 03:27:02.754]  And I guess a lot of these are probably also Islamicists just posing as white supremacists.
[03:27:02.814 --> 03:27:05.157]  As you were saying, a lot of this is crypto-Islamicists.
[03:27:06.179 --> 03:27:07.180]  Absolutely correct.
[03:27:07.280 --> 03:27:07.760]  I 100% yeah.
[03:27:07.800 --> 03:27:09.322]  Perfect.
[03:27:10.644 --> 03:27:12.106]  Start breaking down crypto-Islam.
[03:27:13.399 --> 03:27:15.801]  Well, you know, I mean, you really just said it well.
[03:27:16.601 --> 03:27:27.530]  Crypto-Islam is these people that are going around, hiding behind this Goyim Defense League or GDL, pretending that they are Christian, spreading all of this hate, spreading all of these lies.
[03:27:28.030 --> 03:27:33.094]  And all of their behavior is totally antithetical to anything that the New Testament says.
[03:27:33.854 --> 03:27:35.295]  You know, you're supposed to love your brother.
[03:27:35.315 --> 03:27:42.080]  You're not supposed to go around and scream hate and demand Jews get kicked out of the United States by 2020.
[03:27:44.206 --> 03:27:48.408]  Or 2022 and, you know, go around killing homosexuals.
[03:27:48.448 --> 03:27:52.130]  You're supposed to bring them to Christ to live in truth and natural law.
[03:27:52.170 --> 03:27:55.951]  You're not supposed to go around and bash people over the head and threaten to kill them.
[03:27:56.371 --> 03:28:00.773]  But, you know, when you look in the Islamic texts, that's exactly what these books say.
[03:28:00.793 --> 03:28:01.693]  Kill the kafir.
[03:28:02.494 --> 03:28:04.354]  You know, you can have slaves.
[03:28:04.415 --> 03:28:05.315]  You can beat women.
[03:28:05.375 --> 03:28:06.355]  You can rape women.
[03:28:07.056 --> 03:28:09.597]  All of these things we've actually found in those texts.
[03:28:09.957 --> 03:28:10.317]  And so,
[03:28:10.797 --> 03:28:20.546]  You know, when you start looking at the rhetoric of these groups, it matches what Islam is saying while they're blaming it on Christianity and pretending that they're Christians.
[03:28:20.566 --> 03:28:23.068]  They're hiding behind this veneer of Christianity.
[03:28:23.629 --> 03:28:32.857]  And, you know, some of them may be just dupes that are really Christian and bought into this, but the majority of them actually appear to be crypto-Islamists.
[03:28:34.770 --> 03:28:42.472]  Oh, it's even been tracked back to that, because I know anytime I criticize radical Islam, the Nazis come out of the woodwork to defend it, and so it's them.
[03:28:43.432 --> 03:28:44.433]  It's radical Islam.
[03:28:45.553 --> 03:28:47.854]  Just really quickly, when you look at... We've got to go to break.
[03:28:47.874 --> 03:28:48.474]  We've got to go to break.
[03:28:48.494 --> 03:28:49.474]  I don't want to hear that music.
[03:28:50.294 --> 03:28:50.914]  Stay right there.
[03:28:50.934 --> 03:28:52.895]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:28:53.235 --> 03:28:59.277]  Tomorrow's news, today, whatever you do, spread those live links to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:28:59.397 --> 03:28:59.757]  Stay with us.
[03:29:03.438 --> 03:29:12.308]  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight against The Globalist has been like a 12-round boxing match that's got more like 100 rounds.
[03:29:13.249 --> 03:29:16.073]  And I'd say we're in about the 85th round right now.
[03:29:17.133 --> 03:29:20.716]  Now, just today, I'm shooting this report on Friday afternoon.
[03:29:21.556 --> 03:29:39.770]  We've had really serious sabotage and attacks behind the scenes, and I've decided not to give the specifics of it for reasons that I can't disclose at this time, but the fact that President Trump's getting the country back, the fact that nationalists are getting elected all over the world, the fact that we're now aware of the threat of radical Islam,
[03:29:40.811 --> 03:29:48.773]  The fact that all of this is going on is really making the establishment very, very angry.
[03:29:49.453 --> 03:29:59.735]  It just came out today that Ilhan Omar, the authoritarian Somali that admits she hates America, called up and threatened Jack Dorsey and said, how dare you keep Trump on Twitter?
[03:30:00.135 --> 03:30:04.476]  He criticized me and showed my clips basically praising radical Islam.
[03:30:05.336 --> 03:30:07.577]  And Dorsey explained to her, well, we have free speech in this country.
[03:30:08.311 --> 03:30:21.740]  Well, the truth is, behind the scenes, if you're not President Trump, these types of phone calls and open calls for us to be censored in Congress have had the desired effect of them trying to curtail us and cut us down to nothing.
[03:30:22.100 --> 03:30:25.122]  They're even going after our basic operations center.
[03:30:26.323 --> 03:30:29.325]  They're going after our actual servers, our infrastructure.
[03:30:29.425 --> 03:30:31.187]  But we have redundancy built in.
[03:30:31.747 --> 03:30:37.031]  But that costs a lot of money to have people working overtime to keep our systems in place.
[03:30:37.853 --> 03:30:51.839]  So, in the final equation, if you want to see the globalists defeated, and if you want to see the deep state prosecuted that we're inches away from, if you want to see the tide totally turned, it takes money to prosecute an information war.
[03:30:52.179 --> 03:30:53.920]  We have truth, they have lies.
[03:30:54.541 --> 03:30:58.422]  The truth is more powerful than lies, but they have globalist dirty money.
[03:30:58.862 --> 03:31:00.163]  Fiat Federal Reserve money.
[03:31:00.823 --> 03:31:04.065]  So, I'm launching this weekend, for one week,
[03:31:05.228 --> 03:31:05.748]  New sales.
[03:31:05.829 --> 03:31:07.950]  We're having to end the t-shirt sale 50% off.
[03:31:08.471 --> 03:31:12.253]  We're having to end the sale on a free bottle of Knockout with Brain Force Plus.
[03:31:12.273 --> 03:31:13.314]  That ends in just a couple days.
[03:31:14.775 --> 03:31:17.898]  But we're launching two new super specials right now.

[03:33:23.325 --> 03:33:25.907]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:33:26.507 --> 03:33:30.969]  I want to jam a few calls in from James, Paul, Leonard, and Jaron.
[03:33:30.989 --> 03:33:31.910]  We'll get to you next segment.
[03:33:31.930 --> 03:33:32.750]  You've been real troopers.
[03:33:33.371 --> 03:33:38.373]  So everybody holding gets a $19.95 value t-shirt of your choice.
[03:33:38.393 --> 03:33:40.835]  We'll get your name and number and get that through the customer service.

[03:33:48.226 --> 03:33:54.976]  You know, it just hit me, the mental illness of saying that Israel runs everything.
[03:33:56.197 --> 03:34:00.644]  It's like saying the Russians run everything and Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[03:34:00.804 --> 03:34:01.725]  And there's all these camps.
[03:34:02.226 --> 03:34:03.568]  Alex Jones is a Vatican agent.
[03:34:05.071 --> 03:34:07.212]  Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[03:34:07.872 --> 03:34:09.633]  Alex Jones is a Masonic agent.
[03:34:10.153 --> 03:34:12.414]  And then I saw Larry King suffers another heart attack.
[03:34:12.814 --> 03:34:13.854]  He goes into cardiac arrest.
[03:34:13.895 --> 03:34:14.575]  He might die.
[03:34:14.595 --> 03:34:17.936]  Remember that guy had 10 million viewers on CNN before they got rid of him.
[03:34:18.856 --> 03:34:20.697]  And it's like, see, I'm only saying this because he's Jewish.
[03:34:20.757 --> 03:34:22.458]  I'm worshipping him, showing who my bosses are.
[03:34:23.118 --> 03:34:24.319]  No, the poor guy had a heart attack.
[03:34:24.339 --> 03:34:27.540]  He's a talented broadcaster and doesn't interrupt like I do.
[03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:28.840]  And so I hope he pulls through.
[03:34:28.860 --> 03:34:30.061]  He's just a staple.
[03:34:31.604 --> 03:34:33.125]  How many wants a restaurant in Los Angeles?
[03:34:33.165 --> 03:34:33.805]  He's a pretty nice guy.
[03:34:33.825 --> 03:34:35.025]  I talked to him like five minutes.
[03:34:35.986 --> 03:34:41.067]  The point is, is that Larry King has been a lot fairer in the news and the modern media, hasn't he?
[03:34:41.747 --> 03:34:43.168]  Just like a fixture.
[03:34:44.008 --> 03:34:49.870]  But, but, Jan Ervin, LogosMedia.com, talk show host, looking into all this.
[03:34:50.550 --> 03:35:00.274]  I agree with you that it's crypto-Islam, and that the way Islam is about to be 3 billion people, it's 1.8 billion right now, the globalists are allied with it, and
[03:35:00.934 --> 03:35:13.524]  The entire Jew-bashing right wing can't organize to even criticize Islam because they're too busy falling over themselves, running around saying how much they hate Jews and how much they love Hitler, and proving themselves to each other.
[03:35:13.564 --> 03:35:17.908]  It's all like a boys club of butt-sniffing each other, and none of them can form groups.
[03:35:17.928 --> 03:35:19.049]  They all backstab each other.
[03:35:19.069 --> 03:35:21.491]  They just run around howling Hitler and circle jerks.
[03:35:21.891 --> 03:35:23.713]  Then, of course, most of them are led by leftist groups.
[03:35:23.733 --> 03:35:27.576]  That's been proven, just like the whole Charlottesville thing was clearly led by a bunch of leftists.
[03:35:29.212 --> 03:35:30.052]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:35:30.372 --> 03:35:43.017]  And, you know, we started looking at it, and before the break I was going to mention that Carl Jung, when he, you know, back then he didn't have Hitler to compare Hitler to, so he compared Hitler to Islam.
[03:35:44.381 --> 03:35:50.770]  And we see, you know, there's plenty of evidence that Hitler was heavily allied with the Islamists.
[03:35:50.810 --> 03:35:51.672]  And why is that?
[03:35:51.692 --> 03:35:58.762]  It's because both Hitler and Islam wanted to get rid of the Jews, both Hitler and Islam wanted to stone the gays to death, etc.
[03:35:58.802 --> 03:36:00.224]  Hitler wanted to get rid of Christianity!
[03:36:01.121 --> 03:36:01.781]  Right, exactly.
[03:36:01.821 --> 03:36:05.022]  And the enemy of, you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[03:36:05.082 --> 03:36:07.323]  So he was allied with Islam.
[03:36:07.343 --> 03:36:20.326]  And then when you start getting into these occult organizations, the O.T.O., Alistair Crowley, these sort of things, it strongly appears that it was allied, that these groups were allied with
[03:36:21.166 --> 03:36:22.207]  Uh, with Islam.
[03:36:22.307 --> 03:36:32.930]  And like I said in the last segment, when you look up Baphomet, you can look it up on Wikipedia, in the Oxford English Dictionary, wherever, it says that it's an old spelling of Muhammad.
[03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:41.333]  So, you know, when we get that these satanic groups are allied with Islam, and, you know, here's the thing... Well, Napoleon joined Islam.
[03:36:42.136 --> 03:36:43.976]  Well, let me just say this.
[03:36:44.296 --> 03:36:47.297]  Christianity is we follow Logos, or truth.
[03:36:47.317 --> 03:36:48.797]  You know, I'm allied with truth.
[03:36:48.897 --> 03:36:50.917]  You know, I follow the truth wherever it goes.
[03:36:50.978 --> 03:36:53.538]  And all these people are saying, I'm loyal to the Jews, or whatever.
[03:36:53.598 --> 03:36:54.758]  No, I'm loyal to the truth.
[03:36:55.218 --> 03:37:00.179]  But when we get into Islam, we see that a law is will.
[03:37:00.379 --> 03:37:04.600]  And then we see Alistair Crowley going around saying, do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.
[03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:07.000]  And so, you know, it's about will.
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:08.200]  Do what you will.
[03:37:08.380 --> 03:37:09.921]  Not about what is true or right.
[03:37:09.981 --> 03:37:11.461]  Hitler was all about the power of the will.
[03:37:12.429 --> 03:37:12.669]  Right.
[03:37:14.190 --> 03:37:23.272]  So all of these things, when we get this, we begin to see the agenda and the bait-and-switch, why everybody wants us looking at Israel and at Judaism.
[03:37:23.613 --> 03:37:26.313]  Meanwhile, Europe is being overrun.
[03:37:26.353 --> 03:37:27.894]  We're seeing Sharia passed in Europe.
[03:37:27.914 --> 03:37:34.436]  I was about to say, there aren't 1.8 million Jews literally trying to make me go under Sharia law.
[03:37:35.270 --> 03:37:37.151]  There's what, 16 million?
[03:37:37.351 --> 03:37:42.634]  And then there's 1.2, 1.8 billion Islamists.
[03:37:42.654 --> 03:37:44.035]  So what is the obsession with Jews?
[03:37:44.115 --> 03:37:45.736]  Because quite frankly, it gives me a headache.
[03:37:45.796 --> 03:37:49.078]  I mean, I try to not look at a black guy and go, that's a black guy.
[03:37:49.118 --> 03:37:50.459]  Or look at a Jew and go, that's a Jew.
[03:37:50.699 --> 03:37:52.960]  I fell for those quotes for a long time, too.
[03:37:53.040 --> 03:37:54.341]  And I kept telling myself years ago that
[03:37:56.642 --> 03:38:11.592]  I needed to go through and start fact-checking all the Talmud quotes, etc., and I put it off for five or six years, and then I start going through them, and I even did shows about these fake quotes in the past, and then I find myself eating crow, you know, and scroll down so people can see some of that stuff.
[03:38:12.568 --> 03:38:26.956]  On that document on screen there, you know, and you know, they can, you know, people can read these on screen and you know, but if you scroll down a little further there, that's the, you know, we go through the... Just remember, 90% of our audience is AM and FM stations.
[03:38:27.417 --> 03:38:32.520]  Everybody gets caught up, and I'm not putting you down here, everybody gets caught up in the fact that we're on TV too, but it's, yeah.
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:34.561]  Just tell folks to go read your paper.
[03:38:34.601 --> 03:38:36.082]  Just tell people how to go read your paper.
[03:38:36.682 --> 03:38:38.163]  And I'll, yeah, exactly.
[03:38:38.203 --> 03:38:39.343]  Go to my website and read it.
[03:38:39.584 --> 03:38:39.964]  I will
[03:38:40.822 --> 03:38:41.523]  Get that out.
[03:38:42.204 --> 03:38:45.928]  I'm gonna do my best to get that out by midweek this week.
[03:38:46.228 --> 03:38:50.312]  I'll dedicate some serious time to it this week to getting it up on my website.
[03:38:50.673 --> 03:38:52.315]  You know, and again, I work on donations.
[03:38:52.495 --> 03:38:54.037]  I've been hit hard by this crap.
[03:38:54.117 --> 03:38:58.802]  So, you know, I appreciate anybody, any angels out there who, you know, care to support.
[03:38:59.222 --> 03:39:01.545]  My website, go to logosmedia.com and donate.
[03:39:01.565 --> 03:39:02.847]  Hit the contribute button up there.
[03:39:02.887 --> 03:39:03.988]  Sure, that's what I was going to say.
[03:39:04.129 --> 03:39:09.535]  Why do you get banned when you aren't anti-Israel, but you get loved if you are?
[03:39:09.555 --> 03:39:11.198]  Because, you know, they don't bother banning Nazis.
[03:39:11.218 --> 03:39:12.219]  They're not really doing that.
[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:13.701]  There's some token stuff.
[03:39:13.721 --> 03:39:14.582]  They get protected.
[03:39:15.143 --> 03:39:16.604]  All the Nazis have their websites.
[03:39:17.538 --> 03:39:19.739]  Islam is the religion of peace, we're told.
[03:39:19.779 --> 03:39:21.100]  Meanwhile, it's pro-slavery.
[03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:25.982]  You know, 300 Christians are getting killed at least every single month around the world.
[03:39:26.242 --> 03:39:30.124]  You know, we saw that last Sunday for Easter Sunday in Sri Lanka.
[03:39:30.604 --> 03:39:32.585]  But, you know, this is the regular thing.
[03:39:32.625 --> 03:39:35.386]  But we're fed this nonsense that it's religion of peace.
[03:39:35.746 --> 03:39:44.350]  And what that means is that when everybody is either killed off or forced into Islam, then the world will be peaceful.
[03:39:44.830 --> 03:39:46.632]  You know, so that's what they mean by peace.
[03:39:46.672 --> 03:39:49.074]  This is what their jihad is.
[03:39:49.114 --> 03:39:53.078]  Their jihad is a war against everyone who is not Islamist.
[03:39:53.178 --> 03:40:06.310]  And, you know, they have this spiritual jihad that they put up front, but, you know, when you go through the Quran, 51% of the Quran talks about how to deal with non-Muslim communities.
[03:40:06.730 --> 03:40:07.571]  So why is that?
[03:40:07.611 --> 03:40:09.513]  Why is over half of their religion
[03:40:10.307 --> 03:40:15.030]  ... dedicated to dealing with killing off, raping, murdering other groups.
[03:40:15.130 --> 03:40:18.252]  And then we're sold this, you know, religion of peace stuff.
[03:40:18.312 --> 03:40:33.001]  And then when you go through, like, the English translations of the Quran, they're heavily watered down, or, you know, sentences where it's clearly talking about beating women, etc., beating your wife, raping your, you know, your recent converts or slaves, etc.
[03:40:34.062 --> 03:40:45.013]  All of this stuff is watered down and then you get you can find these things literally in the Quran and the Hadith and the Sharia law, etc So everything is being bait and switched and we're told to look the wrong direction
[03:40:46.065 --> 03:40:49.727]  And, you know, and only focus on the Jews.
[03:40:49.767 --> 03:40:58.551]  In fact, I've had other show hosts contact me and say, do not look at any other group other than Judaism or you are the enemy.
[03:40:58.611 --> 03:41:02.372]  I was told, don't dare swim upstream on this and look at the facts.
[03:41:02.753 --> 03:41:03.673]  Go with the flow.
[03:41:04.173 --> 03:41:06.534]  And so, you know, and these were really odd statements.
[03:41:06.554 --> 03:41:09.896]  And then I start looking into what the actual citations say.
[03:41:10.577 --> 03:41:13.781]  And none of these claims are... Oh, I want to be clear!
[03:41:14.121 --> 03:41:24.556]  Hold on, just let me make one more point here and I'm not saying that I'm, you know, defending Israel or who controls the media or what happened with the USS Liberty, etc.
[03:41:24.696 --> 03:41:27.260]  All I'm saying is when we look at the primary citations,
[03:41:27.680 --> 03:41:28.800]  Who is doing this stuff?
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:35.062]  And, you know, we look in Revelation 3, 9, it says, those who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie and are of the synagogue of Satan.
[03:41:35.362 --> 03:41:38.643]  Well, then who are these people who are not the Jews, but are pretending to be?
[03:41:38.963 --> 03:41:42.444]  And why are we blaming all Jews if there's fake ones out there?
[03:41:42.484 --> 03:41:43.644]  That's another big question.
[03:41:44.465 --> 03:41:46.505]  Well, that's exactly where I've been going with all this.
[03:41:46.805 --> 03:41:50.906]  And, obviously, you get attacked when you discuss what's going on.
[03:41:50.986 --> 03:41:52.407]  We're just simply sitting back saying,
[03:41:53.837 --> 03:41:55.878]  What's the larger manipulation here?
[03:41:56.619 --> 03:42:02.442]  And who are these groups constantly pushing Israel, Israel, Israel, and saying everything comes out of Israel?
[03:42:02.462 --> 03:42:08.106]  Well, that's a distraction, because I've personally experienced all of the weirdness
[03:42:08.982 --> 03:42:17.249]  And just the blind insanity that Israel is running everything, and it's just not the truth.
[03:42:26.357 --> 03:42:36.381]  Marijuana-causing schizophrenia, which you've been talking about, which I've talked about a few years ago, and now I was even talking to Joe Rogan on there, and he's now realizing a lot of that, and probably he's starting to talk about it, so that's certainly some good news.
[03:42:36.782 --> 03:42:49.687]  I'm gonna come back, as I promised, and talk to Paul, and James, and Leonard, and Jaron, and then the War Room with Owen Schroyer, loaded for bear, ready, coming up on AM and FM stations, TV stations, and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:42:49.967 --> 03:42:50.508]  Only you!
[03:42:51.428 --> 03:42:52.831]  Supporting the broadcast.
[03:42:53.492 --> 03:42:54.694]  Only you spreading the links.
[03:42:54.914 --> 03:42:57.398]  Only you telling people about the local stations gets the word out.

[03:43:56.862 --> 03:43:57.003]  Yep!
[03:44:03.203 --> 03:44:05.164]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:44:05.564 --> 03:44:11.807]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[03:44:12.187 --> 03:44:16.149]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[03:44:16.649 --> 03:44:22.652]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[03:44:23.132 --> 03:44:29.153]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[03:44:29.613 --> 03:44:41.115]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[03:44:41.595 --> 03:44:50.857]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[03:44:51.437 --> 03:44:55.201]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[03:44:55.781 --> 03:45:00.306]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:04.147 --> 03:45:13.049]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:45:13.209 --> 03:45:22.032]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:45:22.192 --> 03:45:22.892]  It's ridiculous.
[03:45:23.032 --> 03:45:24.593]  The CoQ10 PPQ.
[03:45:24.733 --> 03:45:27.996]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[03:45:28.256 --> 03:45:33.681]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, it'll be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic's expensive.
[03:45:33.741 --> 03:45:35.863]  This is the organically derived.
[03:45:36.263 --> 03:45:37.184]  This is the real stuff.
[03:45:37.364 --> 03:45:40.927]  I want to warn you, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA 4+.
[03:45:41.027 --> 03:45:47.252]  When I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, we're cut off.
[03:45:47.472 --> 03:45:48.853]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[03:45:48.873 --> 03:45:50.515]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:45:51.195 --> 03:45:51.955]  Then it poured off.
[03:45:52.215 --> 03:45:53.676]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:45:53.796 --> 03:45:55.937]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:45:56.157 --> 03:45:57.697]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:45:57.758 --> 03:45:59.238]  First it tingled, and it came back.
[03:45:59.438 --> 03:46:00.519]  I was like, this is incredible.
[03:46:00.579 --> 03:46:01.379]  But I'm going to warn you.
[03:46:01.599 --> 03:46:06.141]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:46:06.301 --> 03:46:10.082]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[03:46:10.282 --> 03:46:12.583]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[03:46:12.823 --> 03:46:14.604]  So it's the building blocks.
[03:46:14.904 --> 03:46:15.804]  And it's the next level.
[03:46:15.844 --> 03:46:16.785]  It's the best you're going to get.
[03:46:16.905 --> 03:46:19.666]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[03:46:19.706 --> 03:46:20.486]  We're getting into supplements.
[03:46:20.726 --> 03:46:22.548]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[03:46:22.708 --> 03:46:27.914]  But mainly people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:46:28.094 --> 03:46:32.680]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[03:46:32.960 --> 03:46:34.582]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[03:46:35.643 --> 03:46:36.363]  We're good to go.
[03:47:06.155 --> 03:47:08.936]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.356 --> 03:47:15.557]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:15.657 --> 03:47:20.158]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:41.781]  We're shifting gears right now.
[03:47:41.941 --> 03:47:42.862]  Back to your calls.
[03:47:42.902 --> 03:47:46.646]  I appreciate James and Paul and Leonard and Jaron holding.
[03:47:47.347 --> 03:47:53.514]  So let's go ahead and talk to James in California about the forced vaccinations and all this propaganda that's unfolding.
[03:47:53.534 --> 03:47:53.794]  Go ahead.
[03:47:53.814 --> 03:47:54.275]  Thanks for holding.
[03:47:55.516 --> 03:47:55.997]  Hi Alex.
[03:47:56.237 --> 03:47:57.098]  This is James again.
[03:47:58.836 --> 03:48:00.457]  That's right, I held you over so you could finish your point.
[03:48:00.517 --> 03:48:04.319]  So you're critical of me saying, don't California my Texas.
[03:48:04.359 --> 03:48:05.239]  Now I stand by that.
[03:48:06.079 --> 03:48:08.501]  I don't want to turn Texas into California.
[03:48:08.921 --> 03:48:11.362]  That's a Democrat's goal, so I'm doing that to be illustrative.
[03:48:11.382 --> 03:48:12.943]  It doesn't insult good people in California.
[03:48:13.723 --> 03:48:26.709]  It is, yeah, because, you know, people like me have been here our whole lives and generationally, and the people that we noticed that came here came from the East Coast or different places in the United States, mostly from
[03:48:27.694 --> 03:48:33.084]  You know, Ivy League kind of colleges and they came out here and they took over academia.
[03:48:33.105 --> 03:48:33.866]  They've taken over.
[03:48:33.886 --> 03:48:38.796]  I live in a university town, University of California, and they use that as a means to
[03:48:39.483 --> 03:48:41.905]  Indoctrinate people and take over the local government?
[03:48:42.025 --> 03:48:44.187]  Well, I think this is a form of projection.
[03:48:44.207 --> 03:48:45.628]  You know, I didn't ruin California.
[03:48:45.648 --> 03:48:50.352]  So I don't know what you're... The Democrats want to turn Texas into California.
[03:48:50.872 --> 03:48:51.653]  We've pointed that out.
[03:48:51.693 --> 03:48:54.075]  We have shirts that say, don't California my Texas.
[03:48:54.995 --> 03:48:59.699]  And instead we have California with LA and Hollywood crapping all over us.
[03:49:00.119 --> 03:49:02.401]  And so I want to identify that that's enemy held territory.
[03:49:03.082 --> 03:49:03.462]  You know what?
[03:49:03.762 --> 03:49:05.884]  The Scourge is not California.
[03:49:06.468 --> 03:49:12.652]  The scourge is the type of people, the ideology behind... No, I get it.
[03:49:12.732 --> 03:49:13.072]  I get it.
[03:49:13.092 --> 03:49:14.613]  All the locusts of the country have come there.
[03:49:14.653 --> 03:49:16.714]  Look, I can't debate this all day with you, okay?
[03:49:17.075 --> 03:49:19.676]  So, I'm sorry for what happened to the state of California.
[03:49:19.696 --> 03:49:21.117]  I don't think there's any hope for it.
[03:49:21.417 --> 03:49:22.158]  I appreciate your call.
[03:49:23.078 --> 03:49:24.179]  Paul in Vegas.
[03:49:24.219 --> 03:49:25.020]  You're on the air, Paul.
[03:49:25.060 --> 03:49:25.380]  Go ahead.
[03:49:26.803 --> 03:49:28.104]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:49:28.444 --> 03:49:39.390]  I wanted to thank you personally for the vaccination coverage that you guys have done, because I listened to your interview with Dr. Tim Penny, and I decided not to vaccinate my 8-year-old.
[03:49:39.430 --> 03:49:43.512]  That's the one that did the protein bar little programming thing for you, whatever.
[03:49:44.413 --> 03:49:46.014]  When you compare him to other children,
[03:49:46.664 --> 03:49:48.986]  He's taller, he's bigger, he's smarter.
[03:49:49.387 --> 03:49:50.928]  Everything about him has improved.
[03:49:51.368 --> 03:49:53.610]  Oh, let's just say, you look at old videos and old photos.
[03:49:53.650 --> 03:49:55.872]  Kids looked healthy and smart, whether they were black, white, it didn't matter.
[03:49:56.233 --> 03:49:57.954]  Now people look like they're retarded.
[03:49:58.615 --> 03:50:01.478]  I mean, the public is lower IQ, they're dumb, it's the vaccines.
[03:50:02.318 --> 03:50:04.520]  And how he treats his parents, too.
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:08.324]  I believe the vaccinations, they target the empathy.
[03:50:08.834 --> 03:50:09.074]  Absolutely.
[03:50:09.094 --> 03:50:09.734]  God bless you, brother.
[03:50:09.775 --> 03:50:11.515]  Just look, the left says it's your body.
[03:50:11.535 --> 03:50:12.956]  If these idiots have been vaccinated, they're protected.
[03:50:12.996 --> 03:50:14.477]  Why are you supposed to take the vaccine then?
[03:50:14.537 --> 03:50:15.337]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:50:15.357 --> 03:50:15.978]  Leonard in Maine.
[03:50:15.998 --> 03:50:17.038]  Leonard, you're on the air.
[03:50:17.058 --> 03:50:17.318]  Go ahead.
[03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:39.851]  Hi Leonard, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:50:40.231 --> 03:50:41.352]  Thanks for joining us from Maine.
[03:50:42.893 --> 03:50:43.733]  Kate Leonard's gone.
[03:50:44.614 --> 03:50:46.595]  Jaron in Texas, FEMA Region 6.
[03:50:47.336 --> 03:50:48.156]  Jaron, you're on the air.
[03:50:50.958 --> 03:50:52.639]  Hey Alex, can you hear me, man?
[03:50:52.679 --> 03:50:53.380]  Yes sir, I can.
[03:50:53.400 --> 03:50:53.760]  Go ahead.
[03:50:53.780 --> 03:50:56.101]  Sorry, I'm at work right now.
[03:50:57.279 --> 03:51:04.865]  I just want to say to the open borders and stuff, man, it's all a part of Agenda 21.
[03:51:04.926 --> 03:51:13.833]  The United Nations, when they established it in Rio de Janeiro, they made it out to where they wanted to flood the EU, pull the migrants and refugees and stuff.
[03:51:14.193 --> 03:51:16.956]  And look what they're doing now to Texas, you know?
[03:51:17.796 --> 03:51:24.282]  Oh, they said no borders, no wall, no countries at all, that they would organize these groups and flood us and do this.
[03:51:24.302 --> 03:51:24.942]  You're absolutely right.
[03:51:24.982 --> 03:51:25.523]  That's what's happened.
[03:51:26.207 --> 03:51:31.871]  And if Trump don't stop it now, if he don't do it now, then we're going to cave in to the New World Order.
[03:51:32.071 --> 03:51:33.492]  And we got to defeat the New World Order.
[03:51:33.552 --> 03:51:36.394]  We're against the New World Order.
[03:51:36.674 --> 03:51:38.796]  I believe Trump is against the New World Order too, man.
[03:51:39.136 --> 03:51:43.699]  That's why he went on your show before the election and talked to all of us.
[03:51:44.858 --> 03:51:48.480]  My uncle, he got me into it, man, into y'all, Alex Jones.
[03:51:48.840 --> 03:51:50.801]  And my cousin, she just graduated from the U.S.
[03:51:50.821 --> 03:51:51.142]  Marines.
[03:51:51.622 --> 03:51:56.024]  I just wanted to say a shout-out to her and shout-out to y'all and President Trump.
[03:51:56.044 --> 03:51:58.345]  God bless y'all and God bless America.
[03:51:58.886 --> 03:51:59.526]  God bless you, Jerry.
[03:51:59.546 --> 03:52:00.367]  Let me ask this question.
[03:52:00.847 --> 03:52:08.571]  If they bring in all these illegals that have the diseases and don't test them, how do they then point at us that aren't vaccinated and say it's our problem when the government let them in to begin with?
[03:52:10.616 --> 03:52:12.657]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[03:52:12.837 --> 03:52:14.258]  You're cut off a bit, man.
[03:52:14.478 --> 03:52:15.438]  I'm working right now.
[03:52:15.818 --> 03:52:16.358]  No, I understand.
[03:52:16.378 --> 03:52:16.879]  God bless you.
[03:52:16.919 --> 03:52:17.799]  I appreciate your call.
[03:52:19.280 --> 03:52:19.840]  All right, listen.
[03:52:19.980 --> 03:52:22.421]  The War Room's coming up with Owen Schroyer here in just a few minutes.
[03:52:22.961 --> 03:52:24.542]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:52:24.602 --> 03:52:26.863]  And I would ask our radio stations to pick him up as well.
[03:52:26.903 --> 03:52:29.904]  He has a show that's just as informative, I think, in many areas as mine.
[03:52:30.424 --> 03:52:31.284]  I mentioned this.
[03:52:31.405 --> 03:52:32.305]  I never got to it.
[03:52:33.660 --> 03:52:36.403]  I think I'm going to shoot a special report on this because it's so illustrative.
[03:52:37.564 --> 03:52:41.508]  College Biology Courses Compares Fetus to Cancer and Parasite.
[03:52:43.049 --> 03:52:47.633]  Slide from University Lecture Claims Fetus a Legitimate Parasite.
[03:52:49.295 --> 03:52:55.221]  An Upper-Level Biological Course at California University is teaching students that human fetuses are comparable to cancers and parasites.
[03:52:55.901 --> 03:52:57.283]  A photo from the lecture shows.
[03:52:57.303 --> 03:52:58.304]  We can pull the article up.
[03:52:59.687 --> 03:53:06.254]  The disturbing image circulated on Twitter features a slide from a PowerPoint presentation titled, Parallels Between Fetuses and Cancers.
[03:53:06.894 --> 03:53:09.377]  According to the slide, a fetus is a legitimate parasite.
[03:53:10.218 --> 03:53:18.446]  It behaves like a cancer because it rapidly grows, though a cancer kills you, invades, manipulates the immunity of a mother, and reshapes blood vessels.
[03:53:18.847 --> 03:53:20.809]  No, it's a symbiotic relationship between the mother and the baby.
[03:53:22.438 --> 03:53:30.790]  The image was taken during a UC San Diego class according to a Twitter user who uploaded the photo, aspiring neurosurgeon Dylan Griswold.
[03:53:32.112 --> 03:53:34.835]  Griswold says that he's speechless after being sent the photo by a friend.
[03:53:35.779 --> 03:53:37.099]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[03:53:37.119 --> 03:53:41.640]  That story is up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:53:42.120 --> 03:53:45.241]  And again, this information will not get out unless you get it out.
[03:53:45.721 --> 03:53:46.581]  Here's another important thing.
[03:53:46.621 --> 03:53:52.362]  I don't want to just bash Ben Shapiro here, but Jake Tapper admits Trump never called neo-Nazis very fine people.
[03:53:53.943 --> 03:53:57.483]  He's been forced now with a full quote with Conway on there to admit it.
[03:53:57.643 --> 03:53:59.204]  Never got to that clip today, but it's up there.
[03:54:00.504 --> 03:54:05.225]  Ben Shapiro still insists that Trump did.
[03:54:06.334 --> 03:54:09.037]  So again, that's all these folks have is fake quotes.
[03:54:10.058 --> 03:54:11.179]  That's all they've got about me.
[03:54:12.460 --> 03:54:13.641]  That's all they've got about you.
[03:54:14.662 --> 03:54:20.207]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[03:54:20.367 --> 03:54:30.177]  And now we've got Oliver North out as NRA president after leadership dispute with the Southern District of New York investigating them for Russia gate ties.
[03:54:30.956 --> 03:54:36.459]  Because some woman that tried to get a job as a Russian spy also tried to get a job at the NRA and failed.
[03:54:36.539 --> 03:54:38.900]  I mean, this is the evidence?
[03:54:40.140 --> 03:54:42.021]  We can't trust the NRA now?
[03:54:42.421 --> 03:54:43.122]  They're Russians?
[03:54:43.162 --> 03:54:47.744]  Because a quasi-Russian spy tried to get a job at the NRA?
[03:54:50.245 --> 03:54:55.928]  That she could try to influence politicians?
[03:54:57.165 --> 03:54:59.986]  This is what we've come to as a nation.
[03:55:00.066 --> 03:55:00.646]  It's incredible.
[03:55:01.086 --> 03:55:09.048]  There's so many stories we haven't gotten to, but Owen will be covering the latest ones that are breaking, again, at Infowars.com, Portslice Show, and on TV and radio stations across the country.
[03:55:09.068 --> 03:55:11.329]  The war room is really powerful, and I hope you'll tune into it.
[03:55:11.369 --> 03:55:13.369]  We do have some new shows we're going to be launching soon.
[03:55:13.389 --> 03:55:15.230]  We're working diligently on all of that.
[03:55:16.990 --> 03:55:18.051]  I barely plugged today.
[03:55:18.071 --> 03:55:20.571]  Listen, I always say support the broadcast.
[03:55:20.852 --> 03:55:21.592]  We're doing important work.
[03:55:22.032 --> 03:55:24.173]  That's not the real reason to get these products.
[03:55:24.813 --> 03:55:26.734]  We have the best gravity-fed water filters.
[03:55:27.254 --> 03:55:28.194]  We have the best supplements.
[03:55:28.214 --> 03:55:29.114]  We have great t-shirts.
[03:55:29.134 --> 03:55:29.875]  We have great books.
[03:55:30.335 --> 03:55:32.916]  We have a lot of great material at Infowarshore.com.
[03:55:33.656 --> 03:55:35.037]  And we've got some huge specials.
[03:55:35.137 --> 03:55:43.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth Formula with the Chaga Mushroom and the Bee Pollen and the Turmeric and the incredible Bone Broth.
[03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:43.000]  $19.95.
[03:55:43.640 --> 03:55:44.741]  Leading competitors are like $60.
[03:55:45.401 --> 03:55:47.322]  We normally sell it for $29.95.
[03:55:47.702 --> 03:55:48.282]  It's $19.95.
[03:55:49.282 --> 03:55:51.123]  That's our new big special, Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:55:51.543 --> 03:55:56.925]  50% off all supplies last at InfoWareStore.com and your purchase obviously finances the broadcast.
[03:55:56.966 --> 03:55:57.726]  And then the new special,
[03:55:58.919 --> 03:56:01.661]  They have under 1,000 units to do this, okay?
[03:56:02.122 --> 03:56:07.706]  But they're selling them to us at cost, and then we're adding like 30 bucks to the show.
[03:56:08.147 --> 03:56:13.831]  This is the Alexa Pure highest quality stainless steel gravity-fed filter that does over 10,000 gallons with the filters.
[03:56:13.851 --> 03:56:15.333]  We have replacement filters you can buy as well.
[03:56:15.993 --> 03:56:22.959]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is finally back in stock, and they're giving them to us at their cost, so that's $50 off.
[03:56:25.501 --> 03:56:28.922]  That's $199 for their biggest, best unit.
[03:56:29.482 --> 03:56:30.463]  It's an amazing deal.
[03:56:30.903 --> 03:56:32.684]  So Alexa Pure Pro, that's their biggest unit.
[03:56:33.104 --> 03:56:38.086]  Water filtration system, normally $300 for $199.95.
[03:56:39.566 --> 03:56:41.387]  So that is a great deal.
[03:56:41.447 --> 03:56:43.668]  That's 50% off their already discounted price.
[03:56:44.148 --> 03:56:52.211]  And so we get a little bit of support, but the manufacturer produced a whole bunch of these and they give us in a contractual agreement the glut when they get them.
[03:56:52.791 --> 03:56:54.994]  And so they just basically let us discount everything.
[03:56:55.395 --> 03:56:57.137]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[03:56:57.157 --> 03:56:58.659]  Your children and you deserve it.
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:02.164]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:57:02.705 --> 03:57:06.089]  And the Survival Shield X2 is back in stock.
[03:57:06.490 --> 03:57:07.972]  The Pure Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[03:57:08.332 --> 03:57:09.854]  And we have it, of course, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:10.855 --> 03:57:17.521]  For 25% off, get a free bottle of X3 and experience how good X3 is with all three types of iodine, including the Deep Earth Crystal Source.

[03:57:19.783 --> 03:57:21.184]  Those are the new specials.
[03:57:21.504 --> 03:57:22.765]  Those will run for at least a week.
[03:57:23.345 --> 03:57:24.667]  The old special ends today.
[03:57:24.707 --> 03:57:27.249]  A free bottle of Knockout and you get a bottle of Brain Force Plus.
[03:57:27.269 --> 03:57:27.689]  25% off.
[03:57:27.729 --> 03:57:28.149]  Okay, great job.
[03:57:30.191 --> 03:57:32.333]  To the crew today, I'll be back tomorrow.
[03:57:32.433 --> 03:57:33.554]  Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[03:57:33.594 --> 03:57:34.935]  Central, David Knight, 8 a.m.
[03:57:34.975 --> 03:57:35.996]  Central, The David Knight Show.
[03:57:36.457 --> 03:57:38.539]  Owen Schroer, just minutes away.
[03:57:38.599 --> 03:57:39.920]  Hope your local stations carry him.
[03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:44.965]  But regardless, please support those local AM and FM stations and spread the word.
[03:57:45.105 --> 03:57:48.468]  You, again, are helping get the word out in this information warfare fight.
[03:57:48.928 --> 03:57:50.450]  You're not just essential, you're critical.
[03:57:50.730 --> 03:57:51.330]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:51.350 --> 03:57:51.711]  Stay with us.
[03:57:53.246 --> 03:57:54.887]  InfoWars.com.
[03:57:55.907 --> 03:57:57.228]  We're all Alex Jones.
[03:57:58.268 --> 03:58:00.129]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:02.170]  Forbidden information.
[03:58:02.190 --> 03:58:04.552]  InfoWars.com.
[03:58:06.249 --> 03:58:11.171]  I just, guys, I just don't think, uh, I just don't think I have the energy today to do fourth hour.
[03:58:11.191 --> 03:58:12.652]  I just don't think I can do it, guys.
[03:58:13.112 --> 03:58:16.294]  Owen, Owen, I'm getting sick and tired of your BS during the breaks today.
[03:58:16.474 --> 03:58:17.975]  Been bitching all day off air.
[03:58:18.155 --> 03:58:19.355]  I'm tired of being a damn cuck.
[03:58:19.595 --> 03:58:24.578]  Will you just take some of the cuck package that we got here and just fix yourself, man.
[03:58:24.838 --> 03:58:25.278]  Fix it.
[03:58:25.518 --> 03:58:26.139]  I'm sick of it.
[03:58:27.619 --> 03:58:33.421]  Okay, um, I guess I'll try this, uh, Super Male Vitality?
[03:58:33.441 --> 03:58:34.882]  Alright, I'll give it a try.
[03:58:34.902 --> 03:58:37.403]  Hmm, says two droppers, okay.
[03:58:38.083 --> 03:58:39.544]  Super Male Vitality, huh?
[03:58:39.784 --> 03:58:42.605]  I don't know, I mean, I'm not totally feeling it yet.
[03:58:42.625 --> 03:58:44.526]  Let me try this, um, Alpha Power?
[03:58:44.646 --> 03:58:46.727]  From InfoWarsStore.com, huh?
[03:58:48.027 --> 03:58:50.191]  Two Alpha Power supplement pills here.
[03:58:50.331 --> 03:58:52.234]  I guess I'll just try this Alpha Power too.
[03:58:52.315 --> 03:58:53.056]  Maybe this will help.
[03:58:54.118 --> 03:58:54.939]  Alpha Power, huh?
[03:58:54.959 --> 03:58:56.522]  I think I'm starting to feel something.
[03:58:56.642 --> 03:58:59.487]  But this Super Male Vitality Alpha Power...
