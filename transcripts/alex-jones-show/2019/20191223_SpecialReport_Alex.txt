[00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:02.036]  Breaking news this hour.
[00:00:02.096 --> 00:00:05.680]  Officials say multi-millionaire Jeffrey Epstein has taken his own life.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.305]  Jeffrey Epstein is dead after being found unresponsive at a New York City jail Saturday morning.
[00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:12.427]  After apparently taking his own life.
[00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:14.950]  Officials say that his death was an apparent suicide.
[00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.534]  Surveillance video recorded inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center is missing.
[00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:22.638]  A camera situated just outside of Epstein's jail cell
[00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:29.841]  The footage from at least one camera in the hallway may be too damaged or unusable for investigators.
[00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.903]  An FBI crime lab is examining two prison cameras that malfunctioned.
[00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:35.924]  Surveillance video from outside his jail cell?
[00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:37.165]  It's gone missing!
[00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:48.391]  Now this will of course raise even more questions about whether the surveillance cameras were purposely tampered with and if Epstein's death was more than just suicide by hanging as it was ruled in an autopsy.
[00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:54.964]  In what may become one of the biggest child molesting cases ever on record.
[00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:58.106]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:00:58.606 --> 00:00:59.246]  Years ago.
[00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:06.970]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.211]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:10.992]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.274]  Doctor who witnessed Epstein autopsy.
[00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:18.556]  Death more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicide.
[00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:19.837]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:25.020]  For some odd reason, people that have information on the Clintons end up dead.
[00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.342]  And they usually die from suicide.
[00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:35.027]  The President of the United States is pushing a dangerous and completely unfounded murder conspiracy theory about his predecessor.
[00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:37.228]  He is spreading a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:40.850]  Untrustworthy and ridiculous conspiracy theories.
[00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.132]  Tying the death of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in prison to the president's former political rivals, the Clintons.
[00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:50.174]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.655]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:01:53.275 --> 00:02:02.222]  Major twist tonight in the story involving that leaked video of ABC News anchor Amy Robach talking about the network she works for killing the Jeffrey Epstein story.
[00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:04.064]  It was unbelievable what we had.
[00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.865]  Clinton, we had everything.
[00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:10.729]  There will come a day when we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known.
[00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.851]  I had it all three years ago.
[00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.395]  ABC's lead investigative journalist, Amy Rohrbach, is right.
[00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:30.000]  Jeffrey Epstein is the biggest pedophile America and the world has ever known.
[00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:38.889]  But he himself is just a front man for a larger network that is still ongoing to this day.
[00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:48.262]  And whose goals are nothing less than domination of human society by blackmail and corruption.
[00:02:49.282 --> 00:03:01.826]  Tonight we're going to document for you that individuals that work directly with Epstein are still carrying out operations very similar to the operation that he was running.
[00:03:02.642 --> 00:03:25.207]  And we're also going to show you, hiding in plain view, examples of Senate reports, UN reports, and other institutional reports admitting that millions of women and children are being sexually trafficked every year, and that it's one of the biggest currencies on the planet.
[00:03:25.307 --> 00:03:28.728]  This is nothing less than modern slavery.
[00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:36.630]  And the corruption that comes out of it isn't like alcohol prohibition where people fell under the control of the mafia.
[00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:47.415]  It's far worse because they're falling under the control of organizations and groups who even engage in the murder, snuff films of children.
[00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.957]  There is no bottom to this pit.
[00:03:50.977 --> 00:03:57.841]  Just like elites thousands of years ago began to degenerate and do things that are unspeakably evil.
[00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:00.669]  It's happening again today.
[00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:13.243]  And if we don't face the facts and move against these criminals, they're going to be able to take over the whole civilization like they've done the Vatican, Penn State, the Boy Scouts.
[00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:16.347]  There's nothing that's safe.
[00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.354]  Because this is a formula of evil and corruption.
[00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:24.277]  Now, we're going to go to an investigator that I've known for two years.
[00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:25.258]  He was ready to go public.
[00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:26.999]  He's got recordings.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.902]  He's got people admitting that they like to have sex with children.
[00:04:30.282 --> 00:04:30.903]  He's got it all.
[00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:36.648]  And I said, in this first rollout, let's just look what's hiding in plain view.
[00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:40.736]  And you're going to get a look at some of that right now.
[00:04:40.816 --> 00:04:50.641]  Then I'm going to come back in here later and go over the Clinton body count and how it ties in to these charts on the deep state that were developed by the Epoch Times.
[00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:51.742]  And they're very, very accurate.
[00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:57.105]  So whatever you do, please research this information for yourself and then share this report.
[00:04:57.125 --> 00:05:05.089]  We had to build our own network, our own satellites, our own TV systems, and Band.Video to even be able to get this out to you.
[00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:08.859]  So here is the report.
[00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:14.636]  Welcome to AviLoop, your collective buying website for anything aviation.

[00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:45.377]  So what are you waiting for, Captain?
[00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:48.222]  Subscribe to our newsletter and get in the loop.
[00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:52.989]  It's been years since I've been researching the Jeffrey Epstein case.
[00:05:53.823 --> 00:06:01.290]  And the deeper I've gone into my research, there's been bombshell after bombshell, exposing new facts and bringing more revelations to light.
[00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:10.959]  But recently, the facts that I've come across have been so especially jarring that I come to you here today, albeit in a veiled identity, to bring those facts to light.
[00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.861]  So that I can expose what the Epstein case has become.
[00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:21.064]  It has now transcended well beyond the facts behind the purported human trafficker into something much greater.
[00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:28.127]  Into something that's a propaganda tactic that is meant to dissuade popular opinion from uncovering the very truth itself.
[00:06:29.148 --> 00:06:40.013]  Now one important component of the Epstein network, which is limited by that memetic strategy, is the inner machinations of his network and the associates who facilitated his operation.
[00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:47.783]  One important figure in that scope is one of Epstein's victims, his former pilot, Nadia Marchenko.
[00:06:48.204 --> 00:06:59.815]  Though media has performed cursory examinations of Marchenko, a full-fledged examination of businesses which she created during and after her association with Jeffrey Epstein has been entirely neglected.
[00:07:00.496 --> 00:07:08.402]  Now, the construct of those organizations within the context of Epstein's network of associates brings about more concerning questions than answers.
[00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:21.412]  Now, by limiting public perception of the Epstein case, an inspection of Marchenko's businesses and their potential role in the underlying human trafficking operation operated by Epstein and others has yet to unfold.
[00:07:22.446 --> 00:07:24.549]  Some background on Nadia Marchenko.
[00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:34.084]  Nadia Marchenko was born in what was then Czechoslovakia in circa 1986 before coming to the United States in 2000 under the name Nadia Marchenko.
[00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:47.501]  While Marcinko and others contend that she came to the United States to pursue a modeling career, which she did eventually establish, officials in law enforcement offer a different origin of her ingratiation into Epstein's network of associates.
[00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:56.022]  Detective Joseph Ricari investigated the underlying case which led to Epstein's arrest and consequent plea deal in Florida back in 2008.
[00:07:57.183 --> 00:08:02.704]  According to Ricari's notes following an interview with another of Epstein's victims, Epstein had
[00:08:03.427 --> 00:08:06.400]  Purchased Marchenkova from her family in Yugoslavia.
[00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.071]  And she was purchased for the purpose of being a sex slave.
[00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:20.156]  Now, Detective Ricari's investigation also concluded that Epstein subjuncted Marcinko to sexual abuse as he began to rape her when she was only 15 years old.
[00:08:20.877 --> 00:08:27.400]  On one occasion, Epstein forced Marcinko into having sex with other victims, at least two of whom were underage.
[00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:35.485]  Now, despite the horrific abuse that Marcinko was certainly subjected to, she became deeply ingratiated into Epstein's life.
[00:08:36.045 --> 00:08:42.950]  Living with him in Palm Beach, as well as being provided other residences in New York City, as well as apparent financial support.
[00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.374]  Victims who were interviewed also described Marcinko as an actual enabler of Epstein's.
[00:08:49.094 --> 00:09:00.803]  Ultimately, Epstein's apparent favoritism of Marcinko was behind her becoming an FAA-licensed pilot who would ultimately go on to fly Epstein's private Gulfstream, now infamously known as the Lolita Express.
[00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:07.595]  Marcinko's role as the pilot of that aircraft conveys how deeply she was immersed into Epstein's network.
[00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:17.738]  In 2008, when Epstein was offered a non-prosecution agreement, Marcinko was granted immunity from criminal charges as a component of Epstein's plea.
[00:09:18.378 --> 00:09:26.360]  Despite the outcome of that case in 2008, Marcinko would continue to associate herself with Jeffrey Epstein as well as his brother Mark.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.252]  Evidence of that association exists in the establishment of several businesses owned by Markchenko from 2005 to 2011.
[00:09:35.362 --> 00:09:39.924]  Welcome to AviLoop, your collective buying website for anything aviation.
[00:09:40.484 --> 00:09:48.387]  We offer deals on flight lessons, pilot accessories, fuel, FBO services, charter flights, and even small aircraft.
[00:09:48.927 --> 00:09:51.168]  Our deals are usually 50-90% off.
[00:09:51.568 --> 00:09:58.511]  That means, whether you want to learn to fly, charter an airplane, or just see more girls like me, AviLoop can help.
[00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:07.842]  Now in 2005, the first of those businesses, Global Girl Limited Liability Corporation, was incorporated with the New York Department of State's Division of Corporations.
[00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:11.206]  This is the first business which Marchinko seems to have established.
[00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:16.953]  According to Detective Ricarri's deposition as part of a case between Ghislaine Maxwell and Virginia Giffray,
[00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:28.225]  A cross-reference of surveillance on Jeffrey Epstein's Florida residence revealed that the presence of Jeffrey's brother Mark Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Nadia Marchinkova was present.
[00:10:28.725 --> 00:10:37.728]  Now, Detective Ricari's finding is particularly relevant considering it reveals that Mark Epstein was present during his brother's relationship with Marchinkova.
[00:10:38.568 --> 00:10:45.431]  Following Jeffrey Epstein's arrest, plea, and subsequent release from prison, Marchinkova would go on to found the company known as Avilu.
[00:10:46.377 --> 00:10:54.901]  The company's Certificate of Incorporation lists the delivery of service address as 301 East 66th Street in New York City, New York.
[00:10:55.401 --> 00:11:05.366]  The property of that address is notable because it's managed by Osa Properties and Osa Properties in turn is owned by Jeffrey's brother, Mark Epstein.
[00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:18.605]  Now this address was also featured on the Avalube website until recently when it was removed following a request that I had made to Mark Epstein concerning whether or not Avalube currently held a commercial lease in that building.
[00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:23.448]  According to the Avalube website, it also has a sister company named Aviatri.
[00:11:23.888 --> 00:11:31.333]  However, there is no formal business registration with the name Aviatri filed with the same office that had incorporated Avalube.
[00:11:32.754 --> 00:11:36.476]  So now we need to examine the relationship between Avalube and Aviatri.
[00:11:38.268 --> 00:11:40.251]  So it's a market relationship to say the least.
[00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:46.359]  According to Marchinko, Avaloop is a consulting firm that works with aviation companies for a multitude of reasons.
[00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:51.987]  Among those is marketing, events management, pilot contracts, and things of that nature.
[00:11:52.287 --> 00:11:54.631]  But one notable facet of Avaloop's operation
[00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:57.072]  Reveals its sister company Aviatri.
[00:11:57.132 --> 00:12:08.996]  Now this mention is present under a section of the AviLoop website that attests to its commitment to diversifying the workforce of companies in the aviation industry with more female pilots.
[00:12:09.076 --> 00:12:15.138]  Now, while AviLoop does not contain a direct contact number, the Aviatri website does list one.
[00:12:15.478 --> 00:12:22.280]  However, the voicemail that you would receive from that contact number indicates that the caller has actually reached AviLoop.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.542]  This makes delineating between the two businesses very difficult.
[00:12:26.602 --> 00:12:34.727]  Understanding Aviatri's purpose gives you greater insight into how these companies may be an integral part of the Jeffrey Epstein Human Trafficking Network.
[00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.749]  Now, the purpose of Aviatri, allegedly,
[00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.182]  Welcome to Classic Flight Training on Obbyloop.com.
[00:12:41.202 --> 00:12:43.984]  My name is Claire and I'm your deal attendant.
[00:13:03.342 --> 00:13:09.346]  With today's deal, you can channel your inner Top Gun, climb into the cockpit, and learn to fly an airplane.
[00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:14.029]  You can even practice saying, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
[00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:23.655]  The flight lasts one hour under the supervision of an FAA instructor, begins with a ground school lesson, and ends with a new perspective on what you were born to do.
[00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:24.716]  Born to do.
[00:13:24.976 --> 00:13:28.298]  Clearly, your attractiveness increases with every flight under your belt.
[00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:32.461]  Just remember to wear your aviators, and pick a cool call sign, Captain.
[00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:38.952]  Ivaloop also has a dedicated YouTube channel to serve as an outlet for its marketing and promotional material.
[00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:46.897]  However, the YouTube channel simply hosts only four different promotional videos, each of which was posted in 2011.
[00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:50.460]  Each video is a monologue performed by one of three different girls.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:14:01.327]  The monologue makes superficial references to the services which Ivaloop offers, while enticing prospective members who just want to meet more girls into signing up with the company.
[00:14:01.687 --> 00:14:08.549]  Now each girl is performing a monologue dressed in a costume-esque pilot outfit and appears to be young, if not underage.
[00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:12.090]  Clearly your attractiveness increases with every flight under your belt.
[00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:18.272]  And now for a look into why Oviloop's marketing materials are certain to arouse suspicion.

[00:14:52.748 --> 00:14:57.932]  To purchase this deal, you must hold at least a private pilot license and a current medical certificate.

[00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:08.622]  The flight lasts one hour under the supervision of an FAA instructor, begins with a ground school lesson, and ends with a new perspective on what you were born to do.
[00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:10.325]  And remember Top Gun?
[00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:14.232]  Clearly your attractiveness increases with every flight under your belt.
[00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:18.379]  Just remember to wear your aviators and pick a cool call sign, Captain.

[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.404]  Now, on their face, you could qualify those videos as just being entirely inappropriate.
[00:17:03.444 --> 00:17:14.832]  Now, within the context of a human trafficking network and a business owned by one of its associates, it might be fair to say that those videos are instead nefarious, promising to
[00:17:15.652 --> 00:17:33.349]  Give visitors the opportunity to see more girls like these, along with these sexualized costumes, makes it very difficult to believe that Aviatri or AviLoop is indeed trying to recruit aspiring female pilots for the purposes of advancing their careers.
[00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:38.494]  Now, we looked into this to the effect that we reached out to both Osa Properties
[00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:44.900]  And as well as to Avi Loop to try to get Mark Epstein or Nadia Marchenko to comment on these issues.
[00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:47.063]  It was to, of course, no avail.
[00:17:47.103 --> 00:17:57.814]  Now following an inquiry made to Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother and the owner of Osa Properties, Avi Loop actually removed the 301 East 66th Street, New York, New York address
[00:17:58.254 --> 00:18:00.595]  That was mentioned on its website.
[00:18:00.836 --> 00:18:10.441]  Following an inquiry made directly to AviLoop concerning its address as well as its relationship with Aviatree, the phone number listed on the Aviatree website was entirely removed.
[00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:16.544]  Changes were made to the AviLoop website as well to remove any mention of its sister company, Aviatree.
[00:18:16.904 --> 00:18:20.567]  However, those changes have since been reversed.
[00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:24.969]  Additionally, the main Aviatree website domain www.aviatree.com
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:25.940]  I'm good.
[00:18:47.674 --> 00:18:52.418]  Now this concludes the information that I've compiled about the businesses associated with Nadya Marchenko.
[00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:54.999]  All this information is in the public sphere.
[00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:58.102]  It's been brought to the attention of other mainstream media outlets.
[00:18:58.462 --> 00:19:01.624]  However, they've decided not to follow up on this story.
[00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:15.675]  That's what makes it so important for people who are seeing this story to search this out on their own, because it's pretty apparent that Jeffrey Epstein and his network of associates and their crimes have not died with him.
[00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:19.713]  You can even vote for your favorite deal attendant and win special prizes.
[00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:21.955]  Our membership is completely free.
[00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:23.656]  Our deals are unbeatable.
[00:19:24.237 --> 00:19:25.137]  And there's no catch.
[00:19:25.738 --> 00:19:27.039]  So what are you waiting for, Captain?
[00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:37.746]  Subscribe to our newsletter and get in the loop.
[00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:44.131]  Again, I want to thank you for caring enough to be tuned into this special report.
[00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:45.772]  And I want to remind you that
[00:19:47.096 --> 00:19:48.637]  This is not a spectator sport.
[00:19:48.697 --> 00:19:50.157]  We need men and women in the arena.
[00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:53.178]  So please research the information we lay out here.
[00:19:53.198 --> 00:20:01.521]  When you find out it's even far worse than we're saying because we're limited by time, I hope that you'll join us in researching this further and exposing it.
[00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:09.364]  But whatever you do, please share this vital report that we're here on Christmas Eve bringing you.
[00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.291]  Now, you saw my brief intro.
[00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:16.952]  You saw the investigator and researcher break down some of this information.
[00:20:16.972 --> 00:20:25.274]  But now we're going to get into even more and zero in on some of the cases and then also pull back and give you the 35,000 foot view.
[00:20:25.354 --> 00:20:27.894]  But one word describes this.
[00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:30.175]  Yes, you can say evil.
[00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:34.576]  Yes, you can say money, power, corruption, control.
[00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:36.696]  But there's a word that describes it.
[00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:38.477]  It has all those words in it.
[00:20:39.437 --> 00:20:40.558]  It's called slavery.
[00:20:41.278 --> 00:20:47.563]  And since the beginning of recorded history, humans have enslaved other humans.
[00:20:48.924 --> 00:20:55.429]  And then generally those civilizations begin to collapse because how we treat the least of us, we end up treating ourselves.
[00:20:55.789 --> 00:21:03.995]  And so the important takeaway for me here, before we lay out more of this information, is that Epstein is only
[00:21:06.112 --> 00:21:07.032]  A minion in this.
[00:21:07.252 --> 00:21:13.154]  And making it all about Epstein and saying he's the greatest pedophile in history is not true.
[00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:16.835]  He was just a high-level manager of these networks.
[00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:29.199]  And so to make it just about him and he's that lone monster is to cover up the reality of what's beneath the water and the larger iceberg, not just the crest of it, not just the tip of it.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.601]  I literally have over 200 articles, Senate reports, documents in front of me.
[00:21:36.257 --> 00:21:47.586]  Where it's admitted that at an industrial scale, women and little girls and boys are being trafficked in sex slavery and also being killed in snuff films.
[00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:54.672]  So before we go back and talk to the investigator who's here in studio with me, let me just show you a few headlines that deal with this.
[00:21:55.252 --> 00:21:58.195]  Here is Wired Magazine last year celebrating my deplatforming.
[00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:06.978]  And amongst the things they say I'm being platformed for is claiming that there are large pedophile networks using it to blackmail and control people.
[00:22:06.998 --> 00:22:12.685]  And there's a black hand dragging me into the darkness.
[00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:15.209]  They're really throwing it.
[00:22:16.573 --> 00:22:17.214]  In your face.
[00:22:17.474 --> 00:22:24.259]  So remember, mainstream media has been covering this up, just like ABC News' own head investigative journalist said.
[00:22:24.579 --> 00:22:27.521]  The blackmail, the Clintons, the little girls, all of it.
[00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:30.283]  But she was ordered to shut it down.
[00:22:30.403 --> 00:22:31.024]  Here's another one.
[00:22:32.545 --> 00:22:33.406]  Washington Post.
[00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:35.027]  Oh, democracy dies in the darkness.
[00:22:35.047 --> 00:22:35.807]  Well, so do the children.
[00:22:36.208 --> 00:22:39.410]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers.
[00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.331]  Senate report.
[00:22:41.499 --> 00:22:45.763]  Documents as young as two years of age, some of which were killed knowingly.
[00:22:46.463 --> 00:22:47.885]  Oh, but that's just Obama.
[00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:52.669]  The Clintons, Laura Sillsby, and Haitian human trafficking.
[00:22:53.349 --> 00:22:59.215]  She was found guilty of smuggling thousands of children out, some of which ended up dying, many of which were in rituals.
[00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:06.081]  And now she changed her name and she heads up the company that has the contract for Amber Alerts.
[00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:21.468]  Very helpful to know when people call in with alerts of where missing kids are so that the establishment, the insiders, can make any changes they need to to protect the children, I'm sure.
[00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:25.648]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you just heard me right.
[00:23:25.668 --> 00:23:35.434]  And then, of course, the London Guardian asked, oh, has the UN learned the lessons of thousands of women and children kidnapped and trafficked all over the world?
[00:23:35.755 --> 00:23:39.617]  No, the UN is a white slavery operation.
[00:23:39.657 --> 00:23:42.579]  Again, white slavery means sex slavery.
[00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:50.145]  So again, the AP's own report two years ago detailed tens of thousands of trafficked children all over the world, hundreds of which
[00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:52.227]  Have been found dead.
[00:23:52.427 --> 00:23:53.168]  Huge report.
[00:23:53.569 --> 00:23:54.650]  Multi-year investigation.
[00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.312]  Almost no coverage.
[00:23:56.713 --> 00:23:58.896]  A blip on the radar.
[00:23:59.677 --> 00:24:01.119]  So, let's expand now.
[00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:16.525]  The Zorro Ranch, where they were doing secret breeding programs, and where billionaires were traveling to supposedly impregnate young girls with the genetics of the master race.
[00:24:16.545 --> 00:24:17.326]  Here's some of the articles.
[00:24:17.766 --> 00:24:22.671]  Jeffrey Epstein wanted to turn Mexico Ranch into baby-making factory.
[00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:26.213]  Once this began to come out in the last year, we'd already exposed it.
[00:24:26.894 --> 00:24:32.140]  They all tried to limit it to Jeffrey Epstein to say he was trying to do it.
[00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:33.982]  It was about him and his babies.
[00:24:34.663 --> 00:24:40.490]  No, it was about eugenics and the National Security Study Memorandum.
[00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:51.905]  200 from Henry Kissinger to set up a world government plan to eradicate the third world population and to create a super race.
[00:24:52.746 --> 00:25:04.833]  This was being carried out at the Albert Einstein University by the shadow government headed up by Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, Ted Turner and others like Oprah Winfrey.
[00:25:04.873 --> 00:25:05.614]  Here it is in
[00:25:06.821 --> 00:25:07.761]  NBC News!
[00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:22.425]  Top billionaires hold secret meeting and this was run by Jeffrey Epstein and they're telling you how great it was and how they were like superheroes and they admit Jeffrey Epstein was the manager of it.
[00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.165]  Secret of Rich Cabal?
[00:25:24.185 --> 00:25:26.206]  Meet to discuss population control.
[00:25:26.686 --> 00:25:27.426]  Wall Street Journals.
[00:25:27.486 --> 00:25:29.627]  Billionaires try to shrink world population.
[00:25:30.407 --> 00:25:31.207]  Report says.
[00:25:32.207 --> 00:25:34.008]  And who is running that as the manager?
[00:25:35.424 --> 00:25:42.312]  Jeffrey Epstein, MIT Media Lab rocked by new Jeffrey Epstein revelations.
[00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:50.662]  And again, recruiting the head of Harvard, recruiting the head of MIT, getting the key people into this group.
[00:25:51.775 --> 00:25:54.997]  Not just with underage girls having sex, but far worse.
[00:25:55.718 --> 00:25:57.259]  Human cloning research.
[00:25:57.479 --> 00:25:58.460]  All of it's going on.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.920]  Funding this in China.
[00:26:00.301 --> 00:26:04.363]  And that's how you control society, is controlling the scientific elite.
[00:26:04.944 --> 00:26:06.405]  A lot bigger than Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:07.646]  Here he is with Harvey Weinstein.
[00:26:08.346 --> 00:26:12.629]  And here he is with the former top Mossad operative's daughter.
[00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:19.814]  Again, their eyes wide shut style regalia at the Prince's party.
[00:26:22.162 --> 00:26:24.104]  So he was bigger than just a Mossad agent.
[00:26:24.144 --> 00:26:30.610]  He was a deep state agent in the CIA, MI6, British intelligence.
[00:26:31.711 --> 00:26:38.457]  Now, I have hundreds of these articles and now they're admitting that it was a blackmail operation.
[00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:41.619]  But again, more than just sex with underage girls.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.342]  It's terrible that happened to the underage girls.
[00:26:46.596 --> 00:26:55.607]  But we know it got even sicker and that smugglers were bringing very young children, according to locals, who witnessed it, to Little St.
[00:26:55.688 --> 00:26:56.589]  John's Island.
[00:26:57.847 --> 00:26:58.047]  I don't
[00:27:21.417 --> 00:27:21.918]  Incredible.
[00:27:22.098 --> 00:27:24.700]  So, again, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[00:27:25.341 --> 00:27:27.603]  Well, it's a lot bigger than that.
[00:27:27.623 --> 00:27:42.276]  And then you see the NXIVM cult trying to set up similar systems and connect them to the Clintons and the Rothmans because they're setting these networks up at the highest levels to the mid-levels and the low level for societal control.
[00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:44.318]  All of it is compartmentalized.
[00:27:44.358 --> 00:27:46.099]  Now, I'm going to go over the Clinton
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:52.463]  Body count chart and some of the other deep state charts where they use all of this to blackmail.
[00:27:52.844 --> 00:27:56.946]  Then we're going to look at meme wars, memetic war that our guest has written a paper on.
[00:27:57.727 --> 00:28:08.233]  And again, how they use limited hangouts like Epstein ran it all with the meme of he didn't kill himself to cover up how deep the rabbit hole really goes.
[00:28:09.134 --> 00:28:10.435]  But this is all fact.
[00:28:11.155 --> 00:28:12.516]  This is all admitted.
[00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:15.206]  I think.
[00:28:29.056 --> 00:28:29.316]  That's
[00:28:49.244 --> 00:28:54.508]  Celebrities well-known people to admit with you in conversations that they like little kids.
[00:28:54.568 --> 00:28:56.529]  I mean they've said what's wrong with right?
[00:28:56.749 --> 00:29:11.339]  Yeah, they've deferred to and like you said earlier when you co-opt academia, that's you know That's a big sign that this is just a social control movement and into the conversations that I've had with these people That's what they go to right away.
[00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:18.484]  They go to these academic Rationalizations that you know, everyone can wrap their head around something because it's been justified by a quote-unquote research
[00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:23.247]  But all it really is is a way for them to, I guess, validate their behaviors.
[00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:25.509]  But that's the direction that these things are going in.
[00:29:25.649 --> 00:29:26.530]  You're right.
[00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.711]  Mad scientists, whether it's the Nazis or the Soviets.
[00:29:28.751 --> 00:29:29.272]  Absolutely.
[00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:30.193]  They're the cutting edge.
[00:29:30.213 --> 00:29:33.315]  They're the cutting edge of society and other people don't understand them.
[00:29:33.775 --> 00:29:35.577]  And it's just a way to rationalize things.
[00:29:35.637 --> 00:29:45.464]  But at the same time, it's particularly dangerous because when you talk about a social control aspect, people in the mainstream, they do look to academics for guidance.
[00:29:45.645 --> 00:29:46.886]  And it's easy to see how
[00:29:47.526 --> 00:29:50.548]  Those ideals can, you know, pervert society.
[00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:56.592]  They permeate into it and all of a sudden you have things just being accepted when they otherwise shouldn't be.
[00:29:56.652 --> 00:29:58.574]  And a big part of that is what we went over today.
[00:29:58.654 --> 00:30:01.276]  People aren't, you know, doing the research on their own.
[00:30:01.456 --> 00:30:06.900]  They're able to fall victims to memetic warfare campaigns because they're being spoon-fed.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.062]  Things catch on, they permeate into popular culture.
[00:30:10.082 --> 00:30:16.647]  And at the end of this presentation, we're going to have that segment you did on meme warfare for folks because that's critical.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.102]  I even felt bad spending five minutes racing through Senate reports admitting this.
[00:30:23.162 --> 00:30:32.045]  I've got stacks of reports out of Italy and Russia of little kids, three-year-old boys, kidnapped and tortured to death after being gang raped and shot in the head.
[00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:35.986]  And then the video of it being sold to Hollywood.
[00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:38.527]  This is a giant black hole.
[00:30:38.547 --> 00:30:40.868]  It's a Ponzi scheme to compromise people.
[00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:44.469]  And then an excuse to carry these operations out.
[00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:47.390]  It's truly, truly evil.
[00:30:49.141 --> 00:31:04.753]  But when you point out things like they have YouTube channels where young women are saying, come here, go on this airline, you like young girls like me, and it's a former pilot of Epstein, clearly that's something the media knows about.
[00:31:04.973 --> 00:31:05.714]  You brought it to them.
[00:31:05.994 --> 00:31:08.996]  It's an example of how crazy this is.
[00:31:09.697 --> 00:31:16.963]  And then even something like that, the media won't follow up on it because supposedly, again, it's all just Jeffrey.
[00:31:18.304 --> 00:31:24.771]  Right, and another response I've gotten from the media is that, you know, and admittedly there are cursory references to people like Nadia Marchenko.
[00:31:24.891 --> 00:31:27.353]  People do bring that up in a very superficial light.
[00:31:27.393 --> 00:31:33.219]  I've been told by mainstream media sources that have turned down my stories that I'm not really presenting any sort of new information.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.242]  In a very respectful way, you know, I respond to them.
[00:31:36.963 --> 00:31:39.545]  You know, by saying, then why isn't there anything about Aviatra out there?
[00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:41.606]  I mean, why haven't you guys shown these videos?
[00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:43.147]  These videos are rather damning.
[00:31:43.207 --> 00:31:54.135]  And I mean, if these are purported, you know, potential victims of a human trafficking network, I mean, what value is there to have a nationally renowned media source show a picture of these kids?
[00:31:54.395 --> 00:31:55.916]  What are the odds you have millions of viewers?
[00:31:55.956 --> 00:31:57.277]  Someone might not recognize them.
[00:31:57.337 --> 00:31:58.538]  Well, exactly right.
[00:31:59.782 --> 00:32:05.746]  The point that they've mentioned in one place, that's the cover-up right there of Hiding in Plain View.
[00:32:05.766 --> 00:32:08.608]  And that's really the big story here is that mainstream media is covering this up.
[00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:11.770]  We've only scratched the tip of the iceberg here.
[00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.091]  This is not known because they don't cover it.
[00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:19.314]  And you look at these girls, I have a 15-year-old daughter that looks older than most of those girls.
[00:32:19.654 --> 00:32:25.238]  And again, this is the pilot for Epstein, currently involved in this, currently running this.
[00:32:25.518 --> 00:32:26.519]  This is sensational.
[00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.731]  Yeah, and it's common sense.
[00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:35.417]  I mean, like, if I was to show you that video, independent of the context, you would view it as being creepy.
[00:32:35.457 --> 00:32:39.561]  I mean, anyone in their right mind would view it as at least being wildly inappropriate.
[00:32:40.022 --> 00:32:48.670]  And the idea that you could run a business being the associate of, you know, the most notorious human trafficker, you know, known to society.
[00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.233]  I mean, he has the most notoriety in terms of his name.
[00:32:51.673 --> 00:32:58.955]  And the fact that, you know, what woman is going to say, oh yeah, no, I'm going to take these airline classes, oh, who runs the company?
[00:32:59.015 --> 00:33:01.296]  Oh, you know, it was Jeffrey Epstein's former pilot.
[00:33:01.736 --> 00:33:02.957]  It's nonsense.
[00:33:02.977 --> 00:33:09.859]  The idea that this is a company that's running a legitimate operation that's going to have the revenue to operate, it's far from that.
[00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:10.219]  It's incredible.
[00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:12.120]  Running one jet is $5 million a year.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.761]  So pulling back from this, even a small one, pulling back from this,
[00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:26.692]  We've been talking for two years or so, and you brought me a lot of evidence, a lot of research, and you've got a lot that is, that you're willing to give to law enforcement, and that you've brought to mainstream media that they haven't gone with.
[00:33:27.052 --> 00:33:29.872]  Text messages, prominent people saying, what's wrong with sex with little kids?
[00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:35.434]  Okay, and then people have been publicly out there denying that they're involved in stuff like this, even though they've been connected to it.
[00:33:36.174 --> 00:33:39.175]  You've got a lot of that, but I chose not to go with that at this point.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.007]  If law enforcement wants to contact you again or the New York Post or wherever, you're ready.
[00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:47.176]  Because it's, it's, it's again, I know what the people will...
[00:33:48.315 --> 00:33:56.503]  What will capture people's attention to go, wait a minute, looks like a bunch of 15, 16 year old girls saying, hey, come learn how to fly with us.
[00:33:57.063 --> 00:33:58.064]  And by the way, do you like me?
[00:33:58.084 --> 00:33:58.845]  You like how I look?
[00:33:58.885 --> 00:33:59.525]  Come join us.
[00:33:59.906 --> 00:34:07.172]  This is obvious what this is with someone who's dead reportedly and who was connected to all this trafficking.
[00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:10.835]  And then it's his former pilot that's doing this and it's ongoing.
[00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:16.338]  Again, right there, this alone is like the string on the sweater that pulls the whole thing out.
[00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:21.361]  And I'm not saying that the pilot who flew all these times is guilty.
[00:34:21.421 --> 00:34:23.542]  I know that she was a suspect, is a suspect.
[00:34:23.902 --> 00:34:25.943]  All I'm saying is this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:34:26.363 --> 00:34:38.969]  Yeah, and the intricacy of the network, I mean, it's just, it's beyond coincidence that not only is it his former pilot and someone who was named as a potential co-conspirator who was actually given immunity in the 2008 plea agreement that Epstein had been given.
[00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:46.754]  It's not just that it's just her, it's her running it out of Jeffrey Epstein's brother's property.
[00:34:47.255 --> 00:34:57.262]  Someone who's the executor of this estate, someone who's essentially at the forefront of the damage control in terms of just closing the claims that these victims are going to have.
[00:34:57.582 --> 00:35:01.785]  Well, this woman is as important as Maxwell, one of the reported pimps.
[00:35:02.085 --> 00:35:02.305]  Right.
[00:35:02.525 --> 00:35:04.806]  I was supposed to have a new whitewash piece come out soon.
[00:35:05.206 --> 00:35:05.867]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:05.907 --> 00:35:12.309]  Ghislaine Maxwell, I mean, she's in talks with a lot of people, different media outlets, and my understanding through law enforcement.
[00:35:12.389 --> 00:35:20.733]  And the thing about Ghislaine that's, you know, important to point out here is that that's somebody who is, you know, she's out there and everyone understands.
[00:35:20.813 --> 00:35:23.734]  It's done any sort of research into this case, who she is.
[00:35:24.134 --> 00:35:25.755]  But even with that prominence,
[00:35:26.035 --> 00:35:30.456]  You know, the common person who's relying on the mainstream media probably doesn't know who she is.
[00:35:30.836 --> 00:35:41.918]  So that's why when you implore people to do their own investigation, take it onto themselves to look into these things, it's imperative because if they're going to be reliant upon the mainstream media to be, you know, given this information, they're not going to get it.
[00:35:42.298 --> 00:35:49.799]  You can't trust the same source that covered this case up for the better part of at least three decades to close the book on.
[00:35:50.519 --> 00:35:51.239]  Well, that's right.
[00:35:51.479 --> 00:35:55.300]  And we know the media is covering it up.
[00:35:56.363 --> 00:36:00.865]  We know that the Justice Department hasn't moved against this particular network because it's so elite.
[00:36:01.605 --> 00:36:05.947]  We know the Queen has started the process of ostracizing Prince Andrew, which she should.
[00:36:05.967 --> 00:36:15.171]  He was at the Christmas party over the weekend though, so I mean, you know, when you look at what happened in the Jimmy Savile case, Jimmy Savile obviously was very close with Prince Charles.
[00:36:15.351 --> 00:36:16.171]  One of his best friends.
[00:36:16.371 --> 00:36:24.715]  Yeah, he was going to be the, my understanding is he was going to be Prince Harry's godfather until some of the controversy broke and they kind
[00:36:24.795 --> 00:36:29.116]  And they did discover his satanic dungeon, killing children, sex with dead bodies.
[00:36:29.496 --> 00:36:29.856]  Absolutely.
[00:36:29.876 --> 00:36:32.777]  And in many ways, that's what Jeffrey Epstein was.
[00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:37.277]  He was very much a gatekeeper for these kinds of operations.
[00:36:37.317 --> 00:36:38.298]  I call him a Renfield.
[00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:40.318]  He was a Dracula character, right.
[00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:46.599]  He's a face to put to the operation that you can put a lot of the blame on.
[00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:50.100]  And when you wipe him off, people think that everything goes down with him.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.860]  And let's be clear.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:37:05.095]  It came out in Florida, in the one county, hundreds of girls, 13, 14, 15, who they were in pressure to go out and get more girls, more girls, more girls, because they were getting so many men into the network and compromising.
[00:37:05.516 --> 00:37:08.319]  These are armies of people that they've compromised.
[00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:23.492]  Yeah, and Virginia Guffray, who is obviously, I think, the most outspoken victim of Epstein's, in deposition testimony in a defamation case between she and Glenn Maxwell, she had talked about how she got away from that network, how she escaped, so to speak.
[00:37:23.552 --> 00:37:33.181]  And she talked about how, when she was brought to Thailand by Maxwell and by Epstein, that she was informed that she was going to start being a recruiter for lack there of a better term.
[00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:35.882]  That now she was going to be bringing girls into the network.
[00:37:35.982 --> 00:37:39.382]  And at that point, you know, she decided that she was just simply going to run away.
[00:37:39.462 --> 00:37:40.983]  And fortunately, she survived.
[00:37:41.043 --> 00:37:47.924]  And to this day, it's probably the best resource we have for what was really going on in that scheme.
[00:37:47.964 --> 00:37:49.145]  But that's exactly what happens.
[00:37:49.185 --> 00:37:57.426]  And you see with Marcinko, it's terribly unfortunate that somebody who was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein's or of any predators, you know, invariably becomes one.
[00:37:57.466 --> 00:37:59.987]  But that's the cyclical nature of this abuse.
[00:38:00.287 --> 00:38:06.910]  And we see the reports of him going to the Bosnia-Herzegovina area and purchasing 12, 13-year-old girls from their families.
[00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.172]  That's what goes on in these incredibly poor areas.
[00:38:10.192 --> 00:38:13.453]  And then we have now his flight manifesto with Bill Clinton.
[00:38:13.974 --> 00:38:17.355]  Most of the flights, Bill Clinton did not take Secret Service and it was not on there.
[00:38:17.835 --> 00:38:27.180]  And they describe in these logs, I mean here it is for TV viewers, they describe in these logs that ABC News and others have had for many, many years that
[00:38:28.772 --> 00:38:32.873]  The girls, again, were dressed like candy canes and things.
[00:38:33.253 --> 00:38:35.853]  Very young, very skinny, girls that look 14, 15, 16.
[00:38:38.214 --> 00:38:43.154]  And that's exactly what we now see in this new flight organization.
[00:38:43.415 --> 00:38:43.775]  Right.
[00:38:43.795 --> 00:38:46.815]  Where again, they're telling women, hey, you want to learn how to be a pilot?
[00:38:47.115 --> 00:38:52.416]  Come to us so they can then process them through, see if they meet whatever the requirements are.
[00:38:52.436 --> 00:38:56.937]  I mean, these are people that worked for someone that was doing this on these aircraft.
[00:38:57.157 --> 00:38:57.317]  Yeah.
[00:38:57.797 --> 00:39:00.379]  And so it's really a two plus two equals four scenario.
[00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:03.261]  Maybe nothing's going on.
[00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:05.983]  And you know, maybe maybe pigs fly.
[00:39:06.584 --> 00:39:07.665]  I'm just simply saying.
[00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:13.091]  We need to see movement against this area and countless others.
[00:39:13.131 --> 00:39:20.375]  I mean, you've done a lot more research, which, again, the media goes, oh, well, we've never really talked about that, but that's known, so it doesn't matter.
[00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:23.476]  That's like saying somebody knows there's a basement full of dead kids.
[00:39:23.777 --> 00:39:25.137]  We don't go check it because they know about it.
[00:39:25.197 --> 00:39:25.377]  No.
[00:39:26.118 --> 00:39:33.642]  They, again, try to normalize all this like it's no big deal and just hope, like you said, it becomes Jeffrey Epstein did a kill himself meme and it stops there.
[00:39:34.042 --> 00:39:35.843]  But we know it's a lot bigger.
[00:39:36.383 --> 00:39:37.103]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:39.475 --> 00:39:40.195]  That's the whole point.
[00:39:40.215 --> 00:39:41.356]  It's so big.
[00:39:41.376 --> 00:39:42.677]  All the information is out there.
[00:39:43.377 --> 00:39:46.578]  It goes to show how protected and how insulated everybody is.
[00:39:46.638 --> 00:39:51.821]  So unless people are going to take it onto themselves through their own volition to do the research, and not only to do the research.
[00:39:52.611 --> 00:39:57.474]  But to take that information and to use it to elicit change, I mean, nothing's going to happen.
[00:39:57.514 --> 00:40:04.638]  We've relied upon these law enforcement agencies, we've relied upon these media sources, and we've relied upon these politicians.
[00:40:05.158 --> 00:40:07.560]  And this is exactly what it's brought us.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.001]  And this is just essentially how the wheel turns.
[00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:12.963]  And if we keep letting it turn this way, then nothing's going to change.
[00:40:13.723 --> 00:40:25.386]  Well, I was told 16, 17 years ago when I would still go out and go on shows and go to Hollywood five or six times a year, and I ended up getting in at the A-list and it was just a bunch of depressed, really freaked out people.
[00:40:26.247 --> 00:40:28.327]  Even the gorgeous women that were there looked soulless.
[00:40:28.427 --> 00:40:29.448]  It just really felt empty.
[00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:32.999]  These people would tell me.
[00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:35.420]  They'd say, look, we're not into kids, but a lot of people are.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:35.820]  Right.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.701]  That guy's a pedophile.
[00:40:36.721 --> 00:40:37.521]  This guy's a pedophile.
[00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:43.183]  They tell me stories about going to a party with A-listers and there'd be like, you know, ten-year-old girls, like, you know, nine-year-old boys.
[00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:45.023]  And it would be the star kids.
[00:40:45.464 --> 00:40:46.924]  And the parents would be there managing them.
[00:40:46.964 --> 00:40:49.005]  And everybody knew that they were, quote, stars.
[00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:54.568]  You know, because the parents let people have sex with them, and the parents then dominated and controlled them.
[00:40:54.588 --> 00:41:01.832]  So we're talking serious abuse, and you've got Disney famously hiring convicted child rapists to come back and direct more films.
[00:41:01.872 --> 00:41:03.674]  I mean, there's so many examples.
[00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:09.797]  The Guardians of the Galaxy director, you know, hosting parties that are pedophile-themed and, you know, making jokes about it.
[00:41:10.157 --> 00:41:12.359]  I mean, this is the entry-level card.
[00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:15.581]  Right, and that's a huge part of it, because you talk about media and you talk about
[00:41:17.122 --> 00:41:17.582]  Absolutely.
[00:41:17.602 --> 00:41:19.943]  You talk about media, you talk about normalization.
[00:41:20.203 --> 00:41:25.146]  Drugging and raping a 13-year-old, analing when she's 13, a young girl, that's okay?
[00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:25.586]  Right.
[00:41:25.606 --> 00:41:25.947]  No, it's not.
[00:41:26.247 --> 00:41:27.127]  It's not, of course not.
[00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:33.231]  But that's the thing, is that they want it to be okay in media, and especially entertainment media is the easiest way to normalize things.
[00:41:33.931 --> 00:41:38.834]  And whether it's accepting people into that strata of society without batting an eye,
[00:41:39.534 --> 00:41:48.043]  Or if it's using the tools of film, of music, and all those other things to just subliminally normalize these kinds of behaviors.
[00:41:49.365 --> 00:41:53.650]  It has a perverse effect, and it has a perverse effect on impressionable people.
[00:41:54.502 --> 00:41:55.183]  And it's growing.
[00:41:55.603 --> 00:41:57.446]  It really is the underbelly of everything.
[00:41:57.486 --> 00:42:01.190]  And you've got Michelle Wolf coming out saying, I killed my baby.
[00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:02.372]  I felt like God when I did it.
[00:42:03.173 --> 00:42:10.342]  You've got all this art that they're pushing, which is really just psychotic men dressed as women doing simulations of murdering babies.
[00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:37.362]  Really, this is what you see when there's no bottom, and the society falls apart, and then all these other groups start imitating what the intelligence agencies are doing, like NXIVM was doing, and start setting it up for themselves, or John of God, and then it just becomes this whole rampant system like we see archaeological records happening to the ancient Babylonians, the ancient Egyptians, it happened with the Druids, it happened in Mesoamerica, and I just wondered
[00:42:38.263 --> 00:42:42.287]  Why this keeps manifesting in civilizations during their decline?
[00:42:42.587 --> 00:42:45.410]  Where this desire to hurt children come from?
[00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.992]  It's decadent and wealth is a very perverse thing.
[00:42:48.032 --> 00:43:03.386]  I think people don't really appreciate what it means to have the power, what it means to have the resources, what it means to have just everything at your fingertips, to have every, you know, desire that you have handed to you and sooner or later from the standpoint of neurological effect, I mean, those excesses
[00:43:04.006 --> 00:43:07.267]  It's hard to quench that thirst and it only breeds more excess.
[00:43:07.307 --> 00:43:08.107]  And that's what you see.
[00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:15.388]  You see that in these stratas of wealth, it becomes something that people use to bond to one another, right?
[00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:19.409]  This is something that people use as if it's sort of like a designer drug.
[00:43:20.049 --> 00:43:23.070]  It's a perverse thing because wealth breeds perversion.
[00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:27.631]  And when you look at any society, the declination of them is grandiosity.
[00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:29.891]  You see the drastic wealth inequalities.
[00:43:29.911 --> 00:43:31.692]  When you look at Rome, Rome went from being a
[00:43:33.052 --> 00:43:38.354]  An empire that actually did well at supporting its poor, to just being one that was much more decadent.
[00:43:38.955 --> 00:43:39.975]  That's something you can transpose.
[00:43:39.995 --> 00:43:41.416]  That's right, early in the Roman system.
[00:43:41.456 --> 00:43:42.676]  Absolutely, they had a grain dole.
[00:43:42.856 --> 00:43:45.257]  If you cheated on your wife, even if you were, they'd kill you.
[00:43:45.697 --> 00:43:45.937]  Right.
[00:43:45.977 --> 00:43:54.621]  But by the end, or the middle of the end, Nero would dress as a werewolf, it's in the histories, and would tear a child apart with his bare teeth at a party with blood all over him.
[00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:55.722]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:43:56.102 --> 00:43:59.205]  And that's something you can transpose throughout history in any epoch.
[00:43:59.385 --> 00:44:05.270]  And it's something that's relevant today, especially because when you see that decadence, it's the sign of a declining civilization.
[00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:10.314]  And this is one of the things that I think is, you know, the most visible example of it.
[00:44:10.374 --> 00:44:17.540]  Because if we're not protecting the most vulnerable of us, if we're not protecting our children, then it's a clear sign of the direction that society is headed in.
[00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:21.272]  You know, I ran into your work two years ago.
[00:44:21.312 --> 00:44:31.581]  You showed me shocking information that we're not going to release today of people that have been implicated in this stuff that you were talking to, just admitting things.
[00:44:31.661 --> 00:44:36.505]  And it's, again, their goal is to normalize it, to have it so big and so huge that we just go, what do you do?
[00:44:36.545 --> 00:44:37.345]  It's like Pennsylvania.
[00:44:37.686 --> 00:44:42.750]  The report came out with the state police and the state grand jury a couple years ago, and they said 3,000 priests over that
[00:44:44.651 --> 00:44:57.816]  Over 3,000 priests in interviews admitted to sexually abusing boys, mainly, many times in the church as a satanic ritual on Saturday nights, Friday nights, and the terrible things they were doing to these little boys as young as 6, 7, 8, most of them about 10 or 11.
[00:44:58.836 --> 00:45:02.018]  And it was so corrupt and huge.
[00:45:02.058 --> 00:45:03.898]  The state's like, most of these priests are too old.
[00:45:04.378 --> 00:45:05.859]  How do we even prosecute them?
[00:45:05.879 --> 00:45:09.320]  It's a crime so big people can't admit it.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.581]  You know, Eisenhower,
[00:45:11.673 --> 00:45:11.853]  I think?
[00:45:33.342 --> 00:45:40.087]  And they would slowly corrupt somebody as an SS officer until, you know, it was a communal thing to do really brutal stuff.
[00:45:40.747 --> 00:45:43.129]  And then pretty soon, you do whatever you're told.
[00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:45.170]  And so this is a process of corruption.
[00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:56.838]  In the Green Bomb speech, which is a detailed account of psychological torture that intelligence agencies have used on everything from just, you know, Manchurian-style candidates to victims of sexual abuse.
[00:45:57.218 --> 00:45:58.099]  That's exactly what they do.
[00:45:58.119 --> 00:46:00.360]  They break you down to the effect that they just
[00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:05.082]  And that's what you said is the most important thing that you've said so far.
[00:46:05.122 --> 00:46:05.642]  It's totally true.
[00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.163]  They're recruiting these young women who go out and can get children.
[00:46:24.321 --> 00:46:29.082]  That's well-known, you know, it's been documented, but in the lore, it's the white man with the kid saying, I've got candy.
[00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:29.322]  Right.
[00:46:29.342 --> 00:46:32.563]  Because you don't go to the man inside, or it's a man dressed up like a woman.
[00:46:33.203 --> 00:46:35.923]  That goes back to the Little Red Riding Hood fables.
[00:46:35.963 --> 00:46:38.684]  Those come from real things and legends that happened.
[00:46:38.984 --> 00:46:42.145]  This is the first time that men have dressed up like women to trick children to come to them.
[00:46:42.405 --> 00:46:44.345]  This is the first time that psychopaths have gone out.
[00:46:44.825 --> 00:46:46.746]  And so it historically happens.
[00:46:47.406 --> 00:46:48.286]  It's happening again.
[00:46:49.466 --> 00:46:50.967]  And we've gone over a lot of this.
[00:46:51.487 --> 00:46:55.029]  We've released really big information that's hiding in plain view.
[00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.432]  And we'll do a part two very, very soon.
[00:46:59.452 --> 00:47:06.616]  I want to go over some of these charts and I want to then go to your breakdown of how they changed the subject with memetic warfare.
[00:47:07.256 --> 00:47:09.717]  But I, again, just want to point out that we have Senate reports.
[00:47:09.757 --> 00:47:10.478]  We have it all here.
[00:47:10.898 --> 00:47:12.499]  This is at an industrial level.
[00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:16.741]  We'll also in a moment play a clip of a congresswoman back 14 years ago.
[00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:24.467]  Who exposed all this and then they drummed her out because it was actually in the record, in the intelligence record, but they didn't want it on the news.
[00:47:24.867 --> 00:47:31.232]  We're gonna play a clip of when it was admitted that DynCorp was doing this with aircraft out of the Caribbean and into Europe as well.
[00:47:31.712 --> 00:47:33.373]  And so we're gonna get to all of this here.
[00:47:34.094 --> 00:47:35.475]  And again, we're only scratching the surface.
[00:47:35.655 --> 00:47:36.816]  Any other points you'd like to add?
[00:47:37.441 --> 00:47:45.210]  No, I guess the most important point right now is just to implore people to take this onto themselves and to look into these things.
[00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.815]  Because everything that I've compiled, through diligence certainly, it's readily accessible.
[00:47:49.955 --> 00:47:51.797]  It's out there and it stands on its own merit.
[00:47:51.817 --> 00:47:52.858]  The truth always does.
[00:47:53.459 --> 00:47:56.842]  And it's just about putting someone in the frame of mind where they can connect the dots.
[00:47:56.862 --> 00:47:57.663]  Because like you said,
[00:47:58.524 --> 00:48:01.946]  Things become so compartmentalized that people don't see things for what they are.
[00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:13.571]  So a shift of a perspective is necessary to have people have the moral conscience that it's going to take to address these issues, bring them to light and take collective action.
[00:48:13.951 --> 00:48:17.813]  Well, it really is an evil black hole, a Ponzi scheme, a reverse pyramid.
[00:48:18.794 --> 00:48:25.116]  And if you think about how it works in a military institution, in the Boy Scouts, in the Catholic Church, anywhere,
[00:48:27.546 --> 00:48:28.607]  One bad thing happens.
[00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:30.969]  People go, this will embarrass the whole institution.
[00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:38.736]  So once you cover up that one thing, even though you weren't involved doing it, now the group can do more and say, by the way, you covered that up.
[00:48:39.276 --> 00:48:40.938]  You've got to let us do more, more, more.
[00:48:40.998 --> 00:48:42.659]  We'll reward you if you go along.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.601]  We'll destroy you if you don't.
[00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:47.484]  And then now they can move more of the pedophiles in.
[00:48:49.096 --> 00:49:05.084]  And then they can abuse the children, use them to recruit, and whether it's Penn State or whether it's the Boy Scouts, I remember three years ago, it was on the news, they're handing out condoms at the Boy Scout Jamboree, and then they wonder why the Boy Scouts is going bankrupt and shutting down.
[00:49:05.504 --> 00:49:06.385]  They took that over.
[00:49:06.465 --> 00:49:07.005]  They ruined it.
[00:49:07.225 --> 00:49:07.925]  They shut it down.
[00:49:07.985 --> 00:49:09.286]  This is warfare.
[00:49:09.766 --> 00:49:10.887]  This is a weapons system.
[00:49:11.647 --> 00:49:14.709]  And so that's why when we have the establishment trying to plant child porn on us,
[00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:19.251]  Four or five months ago, and then reach out and go, oh, we can work with you.
[00:49:19.292 --> 00:49:20.352]  Don't worry, we're not going to tell anybody.
[00:49:20.392 --> 00:49:21.913]  I said, the hell you're not going to tell anybody.
[00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:25.734]  I said, that was planted on there, probably by you.
[00:49:26.195 --> 00:49:27.495]  And I went completely ape.
[00:49:29.236 --> 00:49:30.637]  And then they went, whoa, and pulled back.
[00:49:31.457 --> 00:49:34.859]  And so now we've got investigators on the ground, and we're about to release some really big stuff.
[00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:39.901]  If you want to fight, you better believe you got one, scumbags, because you're not going to compromise me.
[00:49:41.024 --> 00:49:42.825]  And again, this is how they operate.
[00:49:42.865 --> 00:49:48.247]  Most people, ooh, child porn's in our email, hidden codes, that, oh, people got through discovery or whatever.
[00:49:48.847 --> 00:49:50.548]  I'm like, hey, I call you a bluff.
[00:49:50.688 --> 00:49:51.289]  That's not us.
[00:49:51.869 --> 00:49:56.311]  But again, most people, that's why in the Pentagon, you'll hear 10,000 computers the Pentagon found with it.
[00:49:56.331 --> 00:50:01.373]  And they go, oh, don't worry, just do this for us and we won't report to your wife that's there.
[00:50:01.913 --> 00:50:06.015]  And almost all those people were innocent, but they're ordered to just, oh, be part of the coverup.
[00:50:06.035 --> 00:50:09.737]  No, you expose the damn thing out in the open.
[00:50:09.797 --> 00:50:10.157]  Anything else?
[00:50:10.857 --> 00:50:12.258]  No, I hope that's what we can do here today.
[00:50:12.498 --> 00:50:22.925]  I hope that's a step forward in that direction and, you know, I'm excited to get back to hitting the ground running and, you know, looking into this more, hopefully uncovering just as much damning information and bringing it to light.
[00:50:23.506 --> 00:50:25.707]  And you're doing such good work behind the scenes.
[00:50:25.988 --> 00:50:32.432]  I mean, I know you're ready to release the names and the text messages and all the recordings and all of it.
[00:50:32.452 --> 00:50:34.113]  You know, that's pretty dangerous stuff to have.
[00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:36.615]  You know, you've got it in safe places and, you know, other things.
[00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:43.573]  I think now's the time is more and more ripe for this to come out.
[00:50:43.653 --> 00:50:46.696]  So they better be looking over their shoulder.
[00:50:46.996 --> 00:50:47.197]  Yeah.
[00:50:48.458 --> 00:50:48.678]  All right.
[00:50:48.738 --> 00:50:49.098]  Thank you.
[00:50:49.759 --> 00:50:56.886]  We're going to go to a quick little break here and then we're going to come back and look at some of these charts and then we're going to finish up this special transmission.
[00:50:56.966 --> 00:50:57.747]  Thank you for watching.
[00:50:57.767 --> 00:50:58.588]  Please spread this link.
[00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.833]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush.
[00:51:04.744 --> 00:51:13.510]  Deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:18.513]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[00:51:19.253 --> 00:51:27.539]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[00:51:28.522 --> 00:51:41.127]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines, and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[00:51:42.367 --> 00:51:44.528]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S.
[00:51:44.588 --> 00:51:48.049]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.991]  Thank you, Representative.
[00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:55.252]  First, the answer to your first question is no.
[00:51:56.428 --> 00:51:57.348]  Absolutely not.
[00:51:57.468 --> 00:52:07.472]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities that you described.
[00:52:07.793 --> 00:52:16.736]  Well, how do you explain the fact that DynCorp and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[00:52:18.377 --> 00:52:26.080]  I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts.
[00:52:26.806 --> 00:52:33.014]  And there are times that corporations do things they should not do, in which case they tend to be suspended for some period.
[00:52:33.527 --> 00:52:39.629]  There are times then that under the laws and the rules and regulations... Sources say there were dozens of victims.
[00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:43.330]  The teen girls were encouraged to recruit their friends.
[00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:44.490]  We were underage.
[00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:46.190]  We were little girls.
[00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.332]  By the time I was 16, I brought in up to 75 girls.
[00:52:50.972 --> 00:52:53.192]  All the ages of, you know, 14, 15, 16.
[00:52:53.832 --> 00:52:59.334]  People going from 8th grade to 9th grade at just school parties is where I would recruit them from.
[00:52:59.454 --> 00:53:16.023]  You know, before you know it, I'm being lent out to politicians and to academics and to people that you... royalty and people that you just... you would never think, like, how did you get into that position of power in the first place if you're this disgusting, evil, decrepit person on the inside?
[00:53:16.203 --> 00:53:17.743]  It's an absolute secret the U.S.
[00:53:17.803 --> 00:53:26.006]  government negotiated a deal that forgave multi-billionaire Jeff Epstein for procuring sex with about 40 children.
[00:53:26.046 --> 00:53:30.507]  The 2008 agreement protects Epstein and anyone who worked with him from federal charges.
[00:53:30.787 --> 00:53:32.908]  He was basically treated as a celebrity.
[00:53:33.268 --> 00:53:36.949]  He was allowed to come and go six days a week from the jail as he wanted.
[00:53:37.329 --> 00:53:38.890]  Every morning a chauffeur would come.
[00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.832]  Unbelievably, this evil pedophile monster served just 13 months in a county jail.
[00:54:02.703 --> 00:54:05.709]  Acosta is a George W. Bush appointee under the Bush Justice Department.
[00:54:16.949 --> 00:54:22.552]  He conducts his own investigation, he rubber stamps the state charge, and then he seals it.
[00:54:22.732 --> 00:54:26.074]  They were told, leave it alone, Jeffrey Epstein works for U.S.
[00:54:26.154 --> 00:54:27.435]  Intelligence and the FBI.
[00:54:27.555 --> 00:54:33.538]  Now, Bradley Edwards determined to get a federal judge to overturn the sweetheart plea deal.
[00:54:33.758 --> 00:54:42.843]  Somebody with money and power was able to communicate with the government in secrecy, in direct violation of the rights of the crime victims.
[00:54:43.183 --> 00:54:46.566]  I started getting somewhat of an inclination that this is a situation where somehow, for
[00:55:00.618 --> 00:55:08.268]  The defendant and the government are working together against the victims, although that kind of conspiracy theory sounds so preposterous that I didn't want to believe it.
[00:55:08.568 --> 00:55:13.855]  We told you about Jeffrey Epstein and everything he was up to and who he is years ago.
[00:55:14.396 --> 00:55:15.858]  Now it's gonna hit the mainstream.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:40.402]  February 27th, 2019 is on record and is recognized not just as the biggest long form podcast in 2019, but the biggest ever.
[00:55:41.022 --> 00:55:44.683]  It was my second appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.
[00:55:45.103 --> 00:55:49.744]  The third largest podcast he's ever done was my first appearance two and a half years ago.
[00:55:50.324 --> 00:55:51.304]  Now, why is that important?
[00:55:51.965 --> 00:55:53.685]  Well, it shows that
[00:55:54.645 --> 00:56:09.956]  What we're talking about and these issues of shadow government and the international blackmail rings and hidden technologies and breakaway civilizations and the post-human world that's being built is very, very popular.
[00:56:10.736 --> 00:56:14.679]  People are looking for the truth and that is a very, very positive thing.
[00:56:14.739 --> 00:56:19.242]  Now, that said, look at how overweight I am.
[00:56:20.283 --> 00:56:22.004]  In the video from the podcast.
[00:56:22.925 --> 00:56:26.307]  I have lost 39 pounds since then.
[00:56:27.128 --> 00:56:35.233]  In fact, a month later, I was in DC bullhorning the White House asking Trump to take action on internet censorship.
[00:56:35.553 --> 00:56:37.475]  I'd even gained more weight then.
[00:56:38.335 --> 00:56:49.623]  It was only about three and a half months ago that I made the decision to take all of the InfoWars life supplements that I've been promoting to the general public.
[00:56:50.183 --> 00:56:50.533]  That's right.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:55.703]  I was working out the same amount, same lifestyle, everything.
[00:56:55.823 --> 00:56:57.224]  Working very hard under a lot of stress.
[00:56:57.804 --> 00:57:03.628]  And I had forgotten to take most of the supplements because I get busy and I stop taking them like everybody else does.
[00:57:04.208 --> 00:57:12.314]  And when I religiously began to take almost all of the supplements, some of them I don't need like the joint formula and things, and it's been incredible.
[00:57:12.734 --> 00:57:19.158]  The X2, the X3, the vitamin mineral fusion, the fish oil, the krill oil, the brain force plus.
[00:57:19.178 --> 00:57:21.440]  We've been getting more reports out of it, more focused.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.301]  Thank you.
[00:57:38.098 --> 00:57:38.418]  I think so.
[00:57:59.298 --> 00:58:00.159]  It makes your life better.
[00:58:00.839 --> 00:58:01.859]  It funds our operation.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.481]  It will defeat the globalists if you continue to support us.
[00:58:04.501 --> 00:58:05.541]  So it's a total 360 win.
[00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:07.282]  Whatever you do though, take action.
[00:58:07.322 --> 00:58:08.683]  It's made my life so much better.
[00:58:08.703 --> 00:58:10.123]  It's made my mind so much clearer.
[00:58:10.444 --> 00:58:12.985]  You'll find all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:30.885]  The last time I exposed this, about three and a half years ago, Megyn Kelly, who was still on Fox News, took what I covered on air concerning Hillary Clinton and policies that she officially had launched in the Middle East, killing millions of people.
[00:59:32.546 --> 00:59:35.929]  It so upset the establishment that they edited the tape.
[00:59:37.216 --> 00:59:53.011]  To make it sound like I was saying children were being murdered in a pizza place in DC to try to not just discredit what Hillary had done in the Middle East, but also here in the United States in the whole spirit cooking information that came out in WikiLeaks.
[00:59:53.332 --> 00:59:56.235]  So they killed two birds with one stone.
[00:59:57.233 --> 01:00:14.823]  Now what I said in that report three and a half years ago, that she then edited together to be deceptive, was that when Hillary and Bill were running things in the 90s, Madeleine Albright admitted on national television, we'll play a clip in a moment, that they had massively increased the sanctions that Bush Sr.
[01:00:14.843 --> 01:00:21.527]  had done on Iraq and that millions of people had starved to death, including a half million children.
[01:00:23.168 --> 01:00:38.631]  So you see, it's not just the human trafficking, it's not just the wars they start, it's the sanctions as well on food and medicine that Hillary's own best buddy, Marilyn Albright, is admitting killed half a million children, and then even more died after that.
[01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:42.891]  So, here's just another example of what they're doing to children out of their own mouths.
[01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:45.872]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[01:00:46.732 --> 01:00:50.453]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[01:00:53.598 --> 01:00:55.139]  You know, is the price worth it?
[01:00:55.859 --> 01:01:00.541]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:05.804]  Now again, right now, I'm just showing you a few of many examples of worry.
[01:01:06.304 --> 01:01:10.907]  Madeleine Albright from the Clinton administration, and Hillary, later Secretary of State under Obama,
[01:01:11.837 --> 01:01:12.718]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[01:01:38.106 --> 01:01:39.727]  We can talk about the Clinton death list.
[01:01:39.747 --> 01:01:42.509]  We can talk about their criminal networks all day long.
[01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:47.012]  But their crimes they commit are right out in the open.
[01:01:47.633 --> 01:01:52.296]  The head of Hillary's foundation at one time got convicted of smuggling kids.
[01:01:53.137 --> 01:01:54.358]  Now she runs the Amber Alert.
[01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:58.260]  This is like something out of a nightmare science fiction movie.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:58.901]  But let's look
[01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:01.782]  at some of these documents.
[01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:04.603]  Here's a look at the Clinton body count.
[01:02:04.943 --> 01:02:06.903]  And these are just well-known cases.
[01:02:06.983 --> 01:02:14.044]  And now there's been so many others that have died that have been connected to the Clintons.
[01:02:14.685 --> 01:02:19.985]  And this whole network they're using of blackmail to control people through folks like Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:27.887]  And then over here, you've got the Epoch Times breakdown of all of this and how they created the insurance policy and Fusion GPS, the fake dossier.
[01:02:29.107 --> 01:02:34.828]  Tried to set Trump up with double agents with the Russians, but Trump never took the bait.
[01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:50.632]  And now these people who are tied into this whole network are politically trying to impeach and remove the President of the United States, but they're getting more and more desperate as their operatives are exposed.
[01:02:51.612 --> 01:02:53.353]  So we've got to ask ourselves, what are they going to do?
[01:02:53.933 --> 01:02:54.853]  They're going to threaten
[01:02:56.223 --> 01:03:02.645]  To release dirt on all of these people that they've been blackmailing in this network if they don't do what they're told.
[01:03:02.765 --> 01:03:19.489]  But by Infowars and by you and by President Trump who's been going after these networks, exposing Spygate and exposing how they're controlling people with payoffs and blackmail and corruption and threats and lawsuits, then as this information comes out,
[01:03:20.652 --> 01:03:41.768]  It's only going to implicate them, because they can only get away with a blackmail when people don't know about the larger system, and they can just leak in the news that somebody was having sex with a 14-year-old girl, or that somebody is a Satanist, or that someone is involved in the occult, or somebody like Adam Schiff is admittedly at parties doing quote Egyptian rituals with Ed Buck.
[01:03:42.699 --> 01:03:45.561]  And all those dead black men that keep coming out of his house.
[01:03:57.697 --> 01:04:04.901]  See them in detail and follow all the links from the Clinton Body Count, the Dossier Network, to the Insurance Policy, to SpyGate.
[01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:07.503]  And this is the type of information we're presenting.
[01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:08.343]  It's documented.
[01:04:08.684 --> 01:04:09.384]  It's factual.
[01:04:09.604 --> 01:04:10.765]  And that's why they're so scared of us.
[01:04:11.225 --> 01:04:14.347]  That's why they take things out of context and try to shut us down and lie about us.
[01:04:14.387 --> 01:04:16.648]  But they can't stop you from getting this out.
[01:04:18.149 --> 01:04:23.651]  You look at Google, you look at Apple, you look at Twitter, you look at Facebook, all helping suppress us and cover this up.
[01:04:24.012 --> 01:04:27.433]  You try to say Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself, they'll block you on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:04:28.794 --> 01:04:30.634]  That's because they've been caught up in these networks.
[01:04:30.714 --> 01:04:33.696]  They've been corrupted by much of this as well.
[01:04:33.756 --> 01:04:35.216]  And so shame on them.
[01:04:36.097 --> 01:04:37.557]  They are on the wrong side of history.
[01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.699]  And they're going to be exposed because you
[01:04:41.704 --> 01:04:45.246]  are going to share this video and this report to everyone you know.
[01:04:45.947 --> 01:04:54.532]  Now, I'm going to go ahead and end this transmission with our guest and some more of him breaking down meme warfare, memetic warfare, he's absolutely right.
[01:04:54.993 --> 01:05:07.241]  And while you think it's good that there's this awakening, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself, but if that becomes the only story, it's a cover-up because then it's only Jeffrey Epstein that did it and well, you know, he's supposedly dead and so everything is okay, everything's fine.
[01:05:08.081 --> 01:05:10.926]  Please remember, we're also listed as supported in FullWorksStore.com.
[01:05:11.046 --> 01:05:13.791]  Great products, t-shirts, books, films, amazing supplements.
[01:05:14.112 --> 01:05:18.720]  That's how we're able to have this crew here on the night before Christmas.
[01:05:19.764 --> 01:05:27.070]  Bringing you this information only because of your support and the great work of this crew is this possible.
[01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.213]  So we're gonna go ahead and finish up this report and again more reports are coming.
[01:05:31.614 --> 01:05:42.663]  You can do your own research and look into this and I'm sure we'll discover a lot of things we don't know because I've only covered 1% of what we know just because of time constraints but they have been attempting to silence me.
[01:05:43.629 --> 01:05:45.950]  They have been attempting to shut me down.
[01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:47.671]  And they've been celebrating it.
[01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.072]  But look at the archetype of that image.
[01:05:49.832 --> 01:05:50.793]  The red, white, and blue.
[01:05:51.313 --> 01:05:55.615]  Alex Jones with the dark hand of the deep state grabbing me and pulling me into the dark.
[01:05:55.895 --> 01:05:57.076]  They're saying, I'm Voldemort.
[01:05:57.536 --> 01:05:58.736]  He who must not be named.
[01:05:59.457 --> 01:06:02.558]  But really, they're the ones operating and acting in the dark.
[01:06:03.078 --> 01:06:06.180]  And I didn't talk to this artist, but I've talked to a lot of the other artists that work for the system.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.862]  They say these globalists are so reptilian in their thinking that
[01:06:10.993 --> 01:06:17.843]  A lot of the art they put out and things they do actually help us, but that the system still thinks, oh, I like a dark hand dragging Alex into the dark.
[01:06:18.404 --> 01:06:25.534]  But the artists themselves are actually archetypally showing you the truth of the dark hands coming out, trying to silence and suppress America.
[01:06:26.502 --> 01:06:29.404]  No, they are who operate and act like Voldemort, not me.
[01:06:30.044 --> 01:06:30.345]  All right.
[01:06:30.985 --> 01:06:32.686]  Thank you so much for watching this transmission.
[01:06:32.986 --> 01:06:34.067]  Here is its conclusion.
[01:06:34.668 --> 01:06:35.448]  God bless you all.
[01:06:35.808 --> 01:06:45.015]  Please share this for the children, for our culture, and for our society so the blackmail can end and so the justice can be brought to these individuals.
[01:06:45.055 --> 01:06:45.335]  Thank you.
[01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:00.741]  InfoWars.
[01:07:01.081 --> 01:07:01.981]  Tomorrow's News.
[01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:02.762]  Today.
[01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:09.423]  The Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself meme has considerable value as a propaganda tool.
[01:07:10.103 --> 01:07:14.944]  Rarely do we find dissent against accepted narratives adopted in the mainstream media.
[01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.764]  Of course, rare exceptions do occur.
[01:07:17.384 --> 01:07:24.826]  Of those, the exceptions are predominantly aimed at misrepresentations, which undermine the credibility of dissidents and the basis of their dissent.
[01:07:25.706 --> 01:07:30.270]  By constructing a false narrative, dissent can be co-opted and consequently emasculated.
[01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:39.919]  Easy apparent examples of this are miscontextualized quotes, edits to interviews, and disingenuous forms for debate which ultimately just misconstrue facts.
[01:07:40.552 --> 01:07:53.498]  Yet, unusually, in the case of Jeffrey Epstein's purported death, the mainstream media has propagated what it would otherwise malign as a conspiracy theory by entertaining the premise that he may have been murdered instead of actually having committed suicide.
[01:07:53.959 --> 01:07:59.281]  Now, in doing so, the idea that Epstein didn't kill himself has very much become a meme.
[01:08:00.022 --> 01:08:04.024]  As such, the idea has been weaponized to effectuate a multitude of responses.
[01:08:04.844 --> 01:08:11.686]  All of which ultimately shift the narrative surrounding Epstein's life and crimes, instead of beckoning questions about the crimes that he committed.
[01:08:11.706 --> 01:08:26.350]  His network of accomplices, the ongoing nature of what that network is doing beyond his involvement, as well as the identities, whereabouts, and responsibilities of his co-conspirators, or even if Epstein is actually even dead to begin with.
[01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:39.661]  The media limits the dialogue surrounding this vast, complex issue into something simplistic, which stagnates any legitimate progress towards exposing the depth of Epstein's network, the crimes they committed, and likely continue to commit.
[01:08:40.464 --> 01:08:47.270]  So there's some background on memetics that shows that there is irrefutable evidence that memetic warfare campaigns exist.
[01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:52.776]  Now, the weaponization of memes is an accepted practice in the United States intelligence sphere.
[01:08:53.356 --> 01:08:57.300]  According to Robert Finkelstein, the president of Robotic Technology Incorporated,
[01:08:58.158 --> 01:09:12.209]  A meme warfare strategy has been carefully constructed following research projects performed by the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, also known as DARPA, one of which is titled, in a very literal sense, Military Memetics.
[01:09:12.809 --> 01:09:21.696]  That study evidences the use of memes as a propaganda tool by different entities within the United States Department of Defense and its associated intelligence agencies.
[01:09:22.296 --> 01:09:29.460]  Unsurprisingly, among those, the Central Intelligence Agency is one such entity to construct an articulate meme warfare initiative.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:46.309]  Given its coalescence with the mainstream media channels, as evident through the declassification of files on Project MKUltra's Operation Mockingbird, as well as the frequency of hiring former intelligence officials, including the CIA's previous directors, as analysts on these channels,
[01:09:47.531 --> 01:09:53.306]  It is apparent that the mainstream media is utilizing this as a vehicle to disseminate memetic propaganda.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:01.063]  So as this evidence shows, the use of memetics as a propaganda tool is factually irrefutable.
[01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:17.170]  This is a graph that is sourced from the WikiLeaks Vault 7 release that highlights how meme control centers are responsible for constructing articulate memetic warfare strategies with Vaults to utilize internal I-memes and external E-memes.
[01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:18.771]  Now the difference between I-memes
[01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:27.535]  And e-memes isn't that they are, you know, distinct from one another, but that each of them is a measurable facet of the impact that a meme has.
[01:10:27.735 --> 01:10:29.716]  So they use that to measure its success.
[01:10:29.796 --> 01:10:41.281]  Now, while e-memes are measured through their effect on human behavior and culture, i-memes are analyzed through the cognitive and neurological effect on the individuals within a given audience.
[01:10:42.179 --> 01:10:49.522]  So with this background in mind, we can see the impact that this memetic warfare strategy would have on shifting popular opinion in the Jeffrey Epstein case.
[01:10:49.842 --> 01:10:59.266]  Now, as the aforementioned document states, memes, as defined as above, are cultural bits of information replicated and transmitted from mind to mind.
[01:10:59.746 --> 01:11:04.828]  Memes influence, affect, generate, and ultimately alter ideals.
[01:11:05.916 --> 01:11:12.582]  Based upon the Department of Defense's lexicon, the Epstein-didn't-kill-himself phenomenon certainly qualifies as mean.
[01:11:13.283 --> 01:11:17.527]  As such, its value as a tool within the memetic warfare campaign is entirely viable.
[01:11:18.187 --> 01:11:21.210]  Now, the motives behind its intent are rather apparent.
[01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:25.474]  That is to say that the motive is to alter the perception of what happened to Epstein.
[01:11:25.954 --> 01:11:33.378]  Now, ultimately, one intention of that motive is to quash any examination of Epstein's network, its associates, and their crimes.
[01:11:33.478 --> 01:11:44.364]  Now, this is dangerous because it limits awareness of the figures who are integral to the success of Epstein's network and the possibility of a continuation of their criminal activity.
[01:11:45.222 --> 01:11:53.304]  Christmas 2019 is here and now it's going to be in the rear view mirror as we race forward into 2020.
[01:11:54.405 --> 01:11:56.645]  It's not just a critical election year.
[01:11:57.705 --> 01:12:03.387]  It's a year where I believe we're going to see an even bigger global awakening.
[01:12:03.467 --> 01:12:05.468]  True 2020 sight.
[01:12:06.008 --> 01:12:08.588]  I'm calling it the year of vision.
[01:12:09.429 --> 01:12:13.670]  Our vision of human liberty and a pro-human future versus the globalist nightmare
[01:12:14.844 --> 01:12:15.225]  We're good.
[01:12:22.793 --> 01:12:27.997]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got two articles here that illustrate exactly what we're talking about that are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:34.983]  Christmas cards from China halted after slave labor in prison factory begs for help.
[01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:48.295]  A slave laborer wrote a note literally put inside the Christmas card package saying, help us, we're not even Chinese, we've been arrested here, we're being put in forced labor, it's total hell, help us, notify
[01:12:50.216 --> 01:12:52.198]  Human Rights Organizations, please get us out of here.
[01:12:52.398 --> 01:12:53.199]  You've got to go read the article.
[01:12:53.479 --> 01:13:01.607]  And then another article, dealing with oppression, by Paul Joseph Watson, at Summit.News, InfoWars.com, teachers at U.S.
[01:13:01.647 --> 01:13:06.332]  school threatened to tell Muslim girls' parents after she removed her hijab.
[01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:13.539]  You know, Muslims stone people to death all over the world, or drown their daughters, or light them on fire.
[01:13:14.841 --> 01:13:16.122]  When they take their hijabs off.
[01:13:16.723 --> 01:13:30.719]  Oh, but the left that's so feminist and all about feminine empowerment all over is enforcing Orthodox Islam here in the United States on Muslim women and defending genital mutilation literally cutting their clitorises off.
[01:13:30.759 --> 01:13:32.240]  This is very serious.
[01:13:32.681 --> 01:13:33.662]  It's extremely evil.
[01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:41.108]  And it's going on in our face because the left wants to invite Islam in because it's anti-christian and will take over.
[01:13:41.588 --> 01:13:48.073]  These are the issues we're covering live on air at band.video in the live feeds and at fullwords.com forward slash show.
[01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:48.733]  The only way
[01:13:49.434 --> 01:13:51.815]  This information gets out is when you share those links.
[01:13:51.855 --> 01:13:57.817]  I know you know that, but it's so precious, it's so vital, it's so important, and it's so successful when you do it.
[01:13:58.358 --> 01:14:06.461]  Separately, we fund our operations with the products we sell at InfoWarshaw.com, and when I religiously take the supplements and work out the same amount, I just lose so much weight.
[01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:13.024]  I'm so incredibly healthy with the Super Mel Vitality, the X2, the BioTrue Selenium, the X3, the DNA Force Plus.
[01:14:13.684 --> 01:14:16.545]  If you'll just take these products, I know you'll see a great response.
[01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:26.569]  Not just in your own life, your own libido, your own focus, your own body, but also in your friends and family that you share them with, who then we see become customers.
[01:14:27.069 --> 01:14:30.390]  Not as the products, but they tune into the show and wake up to what's happening.
[01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.131]  A 360 win.
[01:14:31.171 --> 01:14:32.991]  So, help fund a pro-human future.

[01:14:43.315 --> 01:14:45.517]  and your family going into the New Year 2020.
[01:14:46.518 --> 01:14:47.358]  Make the decision.
[01:14:47.839 --> 01:14:48.679]  Make the commitment.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.380]  It's easy.

[01:14:55.765 --> 01:14:56.305]  Now, take action.
[01:15:05.487 --> 01:15:08.489]  Again, we have changed the world together.
[01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.751]  We've proven that we can do it.
[01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:12.052]  We've built these studios.
[01:15:12.312 --> 01:15:14.214]  We're on hundreds of radio and TV stations.
[01:15:14.574 --> 01:15:20.879]  We've gotten past the internet bans, and the globalists are angry, but now the real fight is here.
[01:15:20.999 --> 01:15:21.680]  So whatever
[01:15:27.177 --> 01:15:27.678]  The future is now.
[01:15:27.698 --> 01:15:34.423]  They had us as number one on Droid, number three on Apple, then we went back to get screenshots because our numbers showed us number one, and we're gone.
[01:15:55.512 --> 01:15:57.594]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[01:15:58.015 --> 01:16:02.720]  What users want from us, and what we've always provided them, is a curated platform.
[01:16:03.501 --> 01:16:06.024]  If you're going to curate, that should be all.
[01:16:06.044 --> 01:16:08.046]  Let me tell Tim Cook something.
[01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:10.429]  We're watching you and what you're doing.
[01:16:11.514 --> 01:16:15.915]  InfoWars is steps ahead of the globalist and their censorship agenda.
[01:16:16.116 --> 01:16:18.776]  Getting ready to launch the next few months new apps.
[01:16:18.876 --> 01:16:22.618]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:16:23.198 --> 01:16:26.419]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:16:26.659 --> 01:16:29.320]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.

[01:16:33.201 --> 01:16:36.222]  You will now have Band.Video app on your home screen.
[01:16:36.562 --> 01:16:38.283]  Despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
