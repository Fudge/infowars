[00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:09.522]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:12.544]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:39.872]  The field of anti-Trump presidential campaign buffoonery is upon us, as the field of 18 hubris-riddled lecturers of hypocrisy currently take the national stage to whine about half-baked propaganda cooked to a burnt crisp by their cohorts in the mainstream media.
[00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:41.074]  Yes!
[00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:42.035]  Holy crap!
[00:00:44.532 --> 00:00:50.815]  I learned right here on these streets that you can't make progress by dividing people.
[00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:58.298]  You can't make progress by stoking fear or setting us one against the other.
[00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:01.159]  And that's why I'm here today.
[00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.241]  To tell a different story than Make America Great Again.
[00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:14.334]  Because there's a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities.
[00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:17.995]  The myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.
[00:01:19.456 --> 00:01:25.318]  It comes from people who think the only way to speak to communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia.
[00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:32.300]  They're selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with.
[00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:35.937]  What is democratic socialism?
[00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:36.919]  Fair question.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.340]  Okay.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.302]  So let's talk about it.
[00:01:38.843 --> 00:01:42.150]  What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns?
[00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:42.932]  Do they go to jail?
[00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:49.968]  Well, Jake, they would, but I also offer an alternative which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range.
[00:01:50.168 --> 00:01:59.033]  Their speeches, aside from the whimpering lies and politically correct pandering, fall short of what Americans historically expect on the campaign trail.
[00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:09.519]  For example, Bull Moose Teddy Roosevelt, who had once given a 90-minute speech after being shot in the chest at close range, said this about America's immigration quandary.
[00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:20.042]  We should insist, if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else.
[00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:27.063]  For it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin.
[00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:34.205]  But this is predicated upon the person's becoming, in every facet, an American, and nothing but an American.
[00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:36.686]  There can be no divided allegiance here.
[00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:42.873]  Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all.
[00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:46.237]  We have room for but one flag, the American flag.
[00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:50.842]  We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.
[00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:57.750]  And we have room for but one sole loyalty, and that is a loyalty to the American people, Theodore Roosevelt.
[00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:07.977]  Teddy Roosevelt would be appalled at the foreign interests in meddling, and at the handful of money changers actually supporting this lackluster buffet of windbags.
[00:03:08.237 --> 00:03:10.919]  Now, Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.023]  Like the United States, it has about 311 million people, and of that 311 million people, it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.
[00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:29.475]  So 144,000 are called Leicester, which means about 0.05% is named Leicester.
[00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:33.297]  Now, Leicesters in Leicesterland have this extraordinary power.
[00:03:33.337 --> 00:03:36.539]  There are two elections every election cycle in Leicesterland.
[00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.180]  One is called the General Election.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.482]  The other is called the Leicester Election.
[00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:45.184]  And in the General Election, it's the citizens who get to vote.
[00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:48.266]  But in the Leicester Election, it's the Leicesters who get to vote.
[00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:49.127]  And here's the trick.
[00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.209]  In order to run in the General Election,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.106]  You must do extremely well in the Leicester election.
[00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:00.070]  You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.
[00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.274]  Now, what can we say about democracy in Leicester land?
[00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:11.924]  Well, we can say, number one, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials.
[00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.566]  Because, after all, there is a general election.
[00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:21.429]  But only after the Leicesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.
[00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:32.654]  And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Leicesters is going to produce a subtle, understated, we could say camouflaged bending to keep the Leicesters happy.
[00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.613]  Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt, but it's dependent upon the Leicesters and dependent upon the people.
[00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:49.016]  It has a competing dependency, as we could say, conflicting dependencies, depending upon who the Leicesters are.
[00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:55.279]  President Trump rose above the competition in 2016 because he spoke directly to the people.
[00:04:55.519 --> 00:05:00.101]  The Democrats have tied themselves to a message of socialism, U.S.
[00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:02.442]  constitutional loathing, and division.
[00:05:03.563 --> 00:05:04.869]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.321]  We've got four or five positions.
[00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:16.067]  There's a lot of great things going on at InfoWars that you want to make better.
[00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:28.416]  And if you want to really be involved in the heart of the fight against the globalist, send your resumes, completely confidential and private, to techjobsatinfowars.com.
[00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.638]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill.
[00:05:30.698 --> 00:05:33.300]  There's a lot of new secret projects going on.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:41.426]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech, and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:43.608]  Send your resumes to techjobs.com.

[00:05:51.014 --> 00:05:52.455]  That's what you're going to be doing.
[00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:54.497]  This is the real ticket to adventure.
[00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:58.080]  TechJobs at Infowars.com.

[00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:02.904]  TechJobs at Infowars.com.
[00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.613]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.898 --> 00:06:30.000]  It's Monday, April 22nd, 2019.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.682]  Earth Day.
[00:06:33.682 --> 00:06:34.823]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:36.964]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:39.346]  We are lined up and ready to launch.
[00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.248]  Out of the gates, a very important transmission.
[00:06:44.076 --> 00:07:11.137]  I want to break down today, later in the hour, what Earth Day is really all about, who launched it, what the globalist plan is, and how it's a cover for the globalist to take the planet over, to take control of all life on the planet, and to basically create an artificial system in their own words, a technocracy that the geneticists control, and basically overwrite with nanotech
[00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:17.224]  Which will change the very makeup of the planet forever.
[00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:20.366]  Or boiled down, it means playing God.
[00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:24.088]  Remember the Johnny Depp movie came out a few years ago?
[00:07:24.108 --> 00:07:37.437]  About transcending and he becomes the AI and then he disperses himself into dust, into the clouds to then replicate and take control of the matter of the planet.
[00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.458]  And he is a savior.
[00:07:39.478 --> 00:07:41.460]  It's called transcendence.
[00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:44.839]  That's their goal.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.461]  That's their endgame, is a post-human future.
[00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:50.721]  It's been the plan.
[00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:52.502]  It is the plan.
[00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:55.703]  And whether they can do it or not doesn't matter.
[00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:00.805]  It shows the truly evil spirit that's running them.
[00:08:02.626 --> 00:08:05.607]  And it ties into the spirit of death that we're going to break down at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.247]  I'm going to get into all this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:11.449]  And just incredible statements by the pig-like creature
[00:08:12.907 --> 00:08:27.739]  The mayor of New York, wrecking that once fine city, de Blasio, he has come out and announced a plan that will completely bankrupt New York.
[00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:34.685]  I mean, if you thought the exodus was bad, with 42% of the population polled saying they plan to leave within one year,
[00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:38.942]  And the middle class evacuating will wait till you hear this.
[00:08:39.662 --> 00:08:47.229]  He says they're basically going to tear down all the buildings and make everybody a retrofit for them because, quote, glass and steel is bad for the earth.
[00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.711]  You're like, why would they do that?
[00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:52.894]  Because it's all about destroying prosperity.
[00:08:55.816 --> 00:08:59.359]  How do you think we're supposed to operate when China has no environmental standards?
[00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:06.992]  And we have all these environmental standards, and then crazy stuff like, you can't have carbon dioxide come out of a chimney or out of your car.
[00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:08.112]  It's a toxin.
[00:09:08.212 --> 00:09:08.752]  No, it's not.
[00:09:09.012 --> 00:09:10.272]  It's what plants breathe.
[00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:20.115]  So you put those selective ball and change on just a few European and Western countries, and it's game over financially.
[00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:22.875]  That's all this is, is economic warfare and sabotage.
[00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.275]  We're going to break that down, as I said.
[00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:26.396]  It all ties together at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:30.023 --> 00:09:35.986]  Obviously, when we come back in the next segment, I'm loaded for bear on Sri Lanka.
[00:09:37.166 --> 00:09:42.529]  And I was just watching Fox News before I went live, and they were reporting, we don't know if it's Islamic terror.
[00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.410]  They know who the bombers were.
[00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.451]  They know who their names are.
[00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:51.653]  They were people allowed out of the country to go fight in Syria and were allowed back in.
[00:09:52.794 --> 00:09:56.816]  They said in speeches, we're going to blow you up and kill you.
[00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:00.113]  But notice we can't say it's Muslims.
[00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:07.398]  And so the BBC and Al Jazeera, they're saying it's Islamophobia, this was not Islam.
[00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:10.020]  And you go, well of course it was Islam.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.601]  I know, but they just changed the subject.
[00:10:13.022 --> 00:10:20.487]  It's like saying if you don't want the TPP to run your country, or the EU to take control of the world while you're anti-Semitic, you're like, what's up with Jews?
[00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.609]  They inject that to change the subject.
[00:10:26.348 --> 00:10:32.309]  So don't be anti-Islam while you had nothing to do with these guys taking credit for it and all the rest of it.
[00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:41.292]  Going in and stuffing himself with the all-you-could-eat Easter buffet, and then blowing up the Christians.
[00:10:42.032 --> 00:10:45.573]  Churches have become the number one target in the world, according to the UN.
[00:10:46.293 --> 00:10:50.774]  There's a 300% increase the last decade in churches being blown up and attacked.
[00:10:50.814 --> 00:10:55.055]  But it's always Muslims attacking, but it's not Islam.
[00:10:55.814 --> 00:10:56.234]  That's right.
[00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:00.118]  But then, a white guy goes in and attacks some poor Muslims.
[00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:04.122]  And just this attack in Sri Lanka was 400 times bigger.
[00:11:04.142 --> 00:11:06.004]  400% bigger.
[00:11:06.644 --> 00:11:08.386]  And it's all white people's fault.
[00:11:08.426 --> 00:11:09.267]  It's Christian's fault.
[00:11:09.327 --> 00:11:10.408]  It's the West's fault.
[00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:12.130]  And women wear burqas.
[00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.651]  And they go to daily calls of prayer.
[00:11:13.691 --> 00:11:15.833]  And the police apologize for being white.
[00:11:16.534 --> 00:11:17.715]  And on and on and on.
[00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:24.744]  And Christians, even though this guy wasn't a Christian, apologized to Islam.
[00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:26.987]  Where are the Islamic leaders decrying this?
[00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:28.388]  Where are they?
[00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:33.795]  I think there's one Imam who's come out.
[00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:36.017]  That's better than nothing.
[00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:39.822]  But we have a gentleman joining us in the third hour today.
[00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.872]  Zachary Lee Clown, he's been in the military, smart guy, has a lot of great connections.
[00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:50.055]  He's been one of the sources on air, because he does know a lot of people.
[00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.155]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:55.438]  I've got some other contacts in with some of the same folks.
[00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:08.826]  He's been a Muslim, and he's also been in the military and been hurt in firefights, fighting radical Islam, but he's also witnessed government-sponsored terror.
[00:12:10.387 --> 00:12:12.288]  Which we know has been allowed to take place.
[00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:27.874]  We know there is a role of the globalist arm of the CIA trying to radicalize Islam and pushing the most radical elements like Hillary turning in the Arab Spring all these jihadis loose on our allies and overthrowing moderate regimes.
[00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:28.655]  So yes,
[00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:32.989]  He's right when he says, hey, there's something bigger behind all this.
[00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.410]  So he's a Muslim.
[00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:37.413]  His family come from a prominent family in Morocco.
[00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:38.473]  He's an American.
[00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:39.554]  He's an army veteran.
[00:12:39.574 --> 00:12:40.355]  He's a smart guy.
[00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:43.257]  He'll give us his perspective on that.
[00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:51.823]  And we'll also have open phones as well in the second and third hour, but going into the third hour with Zachary joining us.
[00:12:51.903 --> 00:12:53.664]  And then we also have Will Johnson.
[00:12:54.867 --> 00:13:03.512]  There's a lot of other stuff, too, that I'm obviously going to get to.
[00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:05.994]  You know, I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:07.214]  I never got to it.
[00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:13.278]  Washington State is trying to legalize literal Soylent Green.
[00:13:14.078 --> 00:13:19.962]  And if you don't know what that is, I'll get into that when I get into the whole Earth Day situation at the bottom.
[00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:22.327]  of the hour.
[00:13:47.091 --> 00:13:49.432]  And blow up all the government buildings with the U.S.
[00:13:49.752 --> 00:13:50.132]  Marines.
[00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:53.814]  But this is really becoming a problem.
[00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:57.816]  Mexico is completely out of control and belligerent.
[00:13:58.736 --> 00:14:07.160]  Most of their military is run by the cartels and the Democrats are trying to politically marry us into this whole thing.
[00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:12.163]  They're trying to merge basically into MS-13.
[00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:14.564]  And like Pelosi said, we're all God's children.
[00:14:16.058 --> 00:14:19.720]  Okay, I'm going to announce two things here that are very important, obviously.
[00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:28.505]  We're ending the 50% off apparel sale tomorrow.
[00:14:28.545 --> 00:14:30.286]  It's been very, very successful.
[00:14:31.007 --> 00:14:37.771]  But a lot of the t-shirts that we have are getting close to selling out and some of them are limited edition.
[00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:40.613]  And so we're going to have to end that tomorrow.
[00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:43.654]  So this is the last day for you to get 50% off
[00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:50.282]  All of the apparel, all the ball caps, all the t-shirts.
[00:14:50.302 --> 00:14:53.783]  There's over a hundred designs and it's a great way to support the broadcast and spread the word.
[00:14:55.364 --> 00:14:56.924]  Don't California my USA.
[00:14:57.044 --> 00:14:59.645]  We've got ten new variants of that that are limited edition.
[00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.406]  Don't California my Texas.
[00:15:01.466 --> 00:15:01.846]  You name it.
[00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:05.267]  My favorite Trump versus Medusa t-shirt.
[00:15:05.567 --> 00:15:06.668]  You can guess who Medusa is.
[00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:08.228]  Mean like a Wolverine.
[00:15:08.948 --> 00:15:09.809]  It's all there.
[00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:13.170]  We've got InfoWars patches for like two and a half dollars that are high quality.
[00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:13.910]  Those are at cost.
[00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.751]  Every order gets free bumper stickers.
[00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.992]  And I'm wearing InfoWars Resist Tyranny shirt that's one of my favorites.
[00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:32.497]  And if your radio listener has InfoWars and classic lettering at the top, it's got a shield with the InfoWars crest with the snake of the states joining together.
[00:15:32.517 --> 00:15:34.318]  And it says Resist Tyranny.
[00:15:34.838 --> 00:15:36.779]  And it is a very, very nice shirt.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.141]  And I like the back.
[00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:40.662]  We ought to use that on more of our shirts.
[00:15:40.703 --> 00:15:46.368]  That's the only shirt with that design of the original 13 colonies, but with the Texas star and Info Wars.
[00:15:46.408 --> 00:15:47.169]  Very powerful.
[00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:48.050]  Very proud of that shirt.
[00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.311]  It's one of my favorite shirts.
[00:15:49.351 --> 00:15:56.378]  Hope you'll get the Info Wars Resist Tyranny shirt right now for 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:16:02.512 --> 00:16:03.833]  Most of you know that.
[00:16:03.853 --> 00:16:06.855]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:16:07.215 --> 00:16:13.119]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.404]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:16:19.724 --> 00:16:22.366]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:16:22.646 --> 00:16:30.150]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:38.374]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[00:16:38.975 --> 00:16:43.237]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[00:16:44.102 --> 00:16:47.724]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:16:47.904 --> 00:16:53.867]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[00:16:54.847 --> 00:17:03.692]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[00:17:04.252 --> 00:17:08.434]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[00:17:08.454 --> 00:17:10.195]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:13.091]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:14.413]  It was the last run.
[00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:15.375]  It's been sold out for two months.
[00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:17.360]  How is X2 back?
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.442]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[00:17:21.923 --> 00:17:24.985]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage we couldn't get anymore.
[00:17:25.585 --> 00:17:35.612]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[00:17:35.692 --> 00:17:39.615]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[00:17:40.055 --> 00:17:41.176]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:45.937]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:48.178]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[00:17:48.618 --> 00:17:49.898]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[00:17:50.438 --> 00:17:52.699]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:55.520]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.621]  But many of you hear me talk about this, and it's just more background chatter.
[00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:02.862]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[00:18:03.968 --> 00:18:06.270]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:19.098]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.100]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:23.821]  So iodine is amazing.
[00:18:23.861 --> 00:18:24.442]  It's important.
[00:18:24.462 --> 00:18:26.683]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[00:18:26.743 --> 00:18:27.284]  They'll hurt you.
[00:18:27.664 --> 00:18:28.344]  This is pure.
[00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:29.325]  This is clean.
[00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:30.446]  This is amazing.
[00:18:30.786 --> 00:18:32.567]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[00:18:34.108 --> 00:18:37.729]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:42.811]  X2 Original, from the very first original manufacturer.

[00:19:55.151 --> 00:19:58.234]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[00:20:06.982 --> 00:20:09.725]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:20.255]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:31.612]  You can set your watch by it.
[00:20:32.893 --> 00:20:46.063]  The week of Easter, starting on Palm Sunday, every year since I became a newshound, I've noticed that there are bombings all over the world, shootings, stabbings at Christian churches by Muslims.
[00:20:48.405 --> 00:20:54.390]  And, you know, back when I was a teenager reading about it in the newspaper, seeing it on the news, they said it's Islamic extremist terrorist.
[00:20:55.606 --> 00:21:05.309]  But then Obama got in office and he said, that's not Islam, ISIS isn't Islam, Al-Qaeda's not Islam, even though he was funding them, and the Muslim Brotherhood was running them.
[00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:07.490]  And he said, so that's not Islam.
[00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:17.753]  Actually, it's a very strong form of Orthodox, Wahhabist, Mecca-based, original Islam.
[00:21:19.914 --> 00:21:22.695]  It's as Islamic as Jesus is Christian.
[00:21:24.756 --> 00:21:25.176]  That's fact.
[00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:34.803]  And the argument that this isn't Islam is just a way to distract and cause a debate about that instead of the reality.
[00:21:34.823 --> 00:21:42.107]  I mean, you can go watch the Davos meetings on television.
[00:21:42.127 --> 00:21:46.010]  They're announcing world government, world taxes, technocracies.
[00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.111]  They say, we want to get rid of elected governments.
[00:21:50.832 --> 00:21:53.614]  And then I play clips of world leaders saying, we want world government.
[00:21:56.277 --> 00:21:58.257]  And they have national news say Jones is making it up.
[00:21:58.277 --> 00:21:58.878]  There's no such thing.
[00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:03.538]  That's all these globalists do.
[00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:09.780]  So I could show you hours of Muslims tearing down crosses, crucifying people upside down, throwing gays off buildings.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.360]  And by the way, these are all the governments that Obama supported.
[00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:15.781]  Obama supported putting these radicals in.
[00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:24.383]  And so that does give credence to there's a bigger power manipulating Islam and putting the radicals in charge.
[00:22:24.403 --> 00:22:25.303]  And we have a guest coming on
[00:22:28.274 --> 00:22:33.739]  Zachary Claywon in the third hour to look at the bigger picture.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.782]  But let's look at the facts here.
[00:22:36.282 --> 00:22:44.811]  The story is linked up on DrugsReport.com right up on the left hand side.
[00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:51.697]  It's an Infowars.com posting of the great work of Mr. Schneider.
[00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.970]  In fact, let's go to InfoWars.com and click through to his site and show folks that.
[00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:05.876]  Churches have become the number one target for hate attacks, an average of 105 every single month.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.584]  And the United Nations, and the United Nations
[00:23:17.739 --> 00:23:25.585]  ...admits that over half of all religious attacks and terror attacks in the world are Christians being attacked.
[00:23:28.527 --> 00:23:34.831]  Churches have become the number one target for hate attacks, an average of 105 every single month.
[00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:38.594]  That's the facts.
[00:23:40.916 --> 00:23:45.299]  Meanwhile, when I go through the news that's out there,
[00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:48.821]  The reported Sri Lanka suicide bomber.
[00:23:48.941 --> 00:23:51.483]  Anyone who disagrees with Muslims should be killed.
[00:23:51.523 --> 00:24:02.775]  He shot the video days before the police were looking for him and others who admittedly detonated suicide bombs.
[00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:05.618]  But they're still saying, we don't know if it's Muslims.
[00:24:07.139 --> 00:24:08.520]  These guys had fought in Syria.
[00:24:09.636 --> 00:24:10.997]  They've been allowed back in the country.
[00:24:11.657 --> 00:24:13.178]  They said they were going to kill everybody.
[00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:16.241]  It happened, and the media won't say it's Islamic.
[00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:19.143]  Again, think about how wild that is.
[00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:23.706]  It just boggles the mind.
[00:24:23.766 --> 00:24:24.606]  And then it gets worse.
[00:24:25.067 --> 00:24:26.848]  Our own Greg Reese noticed this last night.
[00:24:26.868 --> 00:24:29.630]  He put a report up on Infowars.com.
[00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:32.572]  Easter worshipers.
[00:24:33.797 --> 00:24:46.156]  Obama and Hillary refuse to use the word Christian after Sri Lanka attacks, but use the word Muslim and Islam in every tweet about the tragic events in Christchurch, New Zealand.
[00:24:47.217 --> 00:24:48.159]  Here's Greg Reese's report.
[00:24:49.753 --> 00:24:56.475]  Both President Obama and Hillary Clinton found it impossible to say the words radical Islam.
[00:24:56.815 --> 00:24:58.455]  Radical Islamic terrorists.
[00:24:59.356 --> 00:25:01.496]  And she won't even mention the word.
[00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:03.377]  And nor will President Obama.
[00:25:03.457 --> 00:25:04.417]  He won't use the term.
[00:25:04.597 --> 00:25:07.278]  Or speak anything negative about Islam.
[00:25:07.398 --> 00:25:14.860]  I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:22.562]  And now after the horrible terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, strangely, they cannot seem to use the word Christian.
[00:25:23.423 --> 00:25:34.306]  Obama, Clinton, and ABC News have all used the word Easter Worshipper, as if an anti-Christian PR firm is feeding them all talking points.
[00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:35.346]  Strange.
[00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:41.048]  At this point, it really just seems obvious what side these people are all working for.
[00:25:46.194 --> 00:25:48.976]  Another key report by Greg Reese.
[00:25:49.157 --> 00:25:59.946]  He put another five-minute report out yesterday that is extremely powerful dealing with the history of Islam that will air in the third hour today and debate.
[00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:02.048]  But here's Paul Joseph Watson's article today.
[00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:06.693]  Easter worshipers Obama and Hillary refused to use the word Christian
[00:26:07.805 --> 00:26:09.086]  After Sri Lanka attacks.
[00:26:10.006 --> 00:26:12.787]  I remember 20 years ago hearing about the war on Christmas and I didn't believe it.
[00:26:12.827 --> 00:26:16.389]  Then I heard about public schools in Texas wouldn't let kids hand out Christmas cards.
[00:26:16.409 --> 00:26:17.890]  Even though that's their free speech.
[00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:21.712]  You just can't have the school officially pushing it.
[00:26:22.672 --> 00:26:26.594]  But the left just presses that separation of church and state until the end of the First Amendment.
[00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:38.215]  And then now they take down Nativity scenes everywhere, they're pulling down crosses in Europe, off churches because it offends Muslims, they're in Italy, they're covering Christian tombstones because the Muslims get mad and tear them down.
[00:26:38.235 --> 00:26:40.816]  I mean, this is just wild!
[00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:50.681]  It's inciting the most radical Muslims to believe that they can literally just piss on Europe, piss on America in some ritual of dominance.
[00:26:52.247 --> 00:26:58.952]  And then Easter worshipers, in your face, you can't say Christian worshipers, Christ worshipers.
[00:26:59.192 --> 00:27:00.513]  Christian means Christ.
[00:27:01.974 --> 00:27:02.154]  No.
[00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:06.417]  You have to call it something else.
[00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:09.179]  It's amazing.
[00:27:11.381 --> 00:27:14.122]  It'd be like calling Muslims Ramadan worshipers.
[00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:19.887]  But it's all about erasing Christianity.
[00:27:19.907 --> 00:27:21.428]  Remember what sort of happened a few years ago?
[00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:29.676]  Google, Apple, and all the other leftist sites removed Christian holidays from the calendars.
[00:27:30.396 --> 00:27:32.137]  Palm Sunday, Easter.
[00:27:33.157 --> 00:27:35.978]  They started calling it Winter Holiday.
[00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:38.799]  Winter Vacation.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:48.443]  See, they're removing any sign of it in your face and rubbing your noses in it.
[00:27:50.003 --> 00:27:53.224]  Over 200 people die, and they won't even say they were Christian.
[00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:54.285]  They won't even say their identity.
[00:27:54.305 --> 00:27:55.305]  They won't even say they were targeted.
[00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:56.106]  They just erase them.
[00:27:56.146 --> 00:27:59.327]  They call them Easter worshipers.
[00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:07.131]  And now leftists in BuzzFeed and others are calling for a modern roof on Notre Dame that conservatives will hate that's not Christian.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.902]  That story's up on Infowars.com as well with so much more.
[00:28:13.243 --> 00:28:14.403]  Oh, look at this headline in the Daily Mail.
[00:28:14.803 --> 00:28:20.406]  Hundreds hurt, any way to whitewash it, hundreds hurt as blasts hit Sri Lanka churches.
[00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:24.288]  Arms and legs, hundreds dead, hundreds fighting for their lives.
[00:28:24.728 --> 00:28:27.050]  Did you hear they scraped their knee?
[00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.711]  Those Easter worshippers.
[00:28:33.214 --> 00:28:41.397]  And Sri Lankan intelligence and others said on April 4th, brace for terror attacks, and they named the Islamic Caliphate Organization.
[00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:45.799]  And of course, the groups took credit, but our own media won't tell you that.
[00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:47.259]  It keeps going, do we know who did it?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.461]  Fox News earlier was like, some think it might have been radical Muslims.
[00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:51.241]  We're not sure, though.
[00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:53.082]  Hell, could have been Christians.
[00:28:53.222 --> 00:28:54.302]  I mean, who knows?
[00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:57.503]  You know, Christians don't like those Easter worshipers.
[00:28:58.304 --> 00:29:00.524]  They didn't go that far, but they were like, no one knows who did it.
[00:29:00.945 --> 00:29:01.605]  No one knows.
[00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:22.148]  Now, normally, when I drink Turbo Force, I usually like to drink it before the war room, and I get a kick, and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[00:29:22.248 --> 00:29:23.448]  I get to work out it and everything.
[00:29:24.009 --> 00:29:27.870]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:36.354]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:39.716]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[00:29:40.556 --> 00:29:41.456]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:41.476 --> 00:29:49.319]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:50.880]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.780]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.381]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[00:29:53.441 --> 00:29:57.502]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[00:29:57.742 --> 00:29:59.143]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[00:29:59.283 --> 00:30:03.086]  Me stirring a cup of turbo force has never looked so good.
[00:30:03.426 --> 00:30:08.850]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out of turbo force with this one, folks, so you better go to Infowarsstore.com immediately.
[00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.711]  Alright, you think I got it?
[00:30:09.731 --> 00:30:12.253]  Look at the turbo force spinning so eloquently.
[00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:16.316]  Nothing to disturb it, just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[00:30:16.516 --> 00:30:22.321]  Yes, ah, I'm thinking of my turbo force and how great it's going to make me feel.
[00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:29.245]  And the pure energy that I'm gonna get from my turbo force at Infowarstore.com.
[00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:30.706]  Yes.
[00:30:31.526 --> 00:30:32.827]  Total equilibrium.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.880]  Find your chi.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.081]  Find the energy with TurboForce at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:44.282]  I'm getting ready for a long four-hour broadcast and I need my energy.
[00:30:44.302 --> 00:30:52.984]  I'm sipping TurboForce mixed with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:53.984 --> 00:30:54.704]  It's magic.
[00:30:55.664 --> 00:30:58.705]  It's TurboForce from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:03.632 --> 00:31:12.538]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[00:31:12.698 --> 00:31:21.524]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[00:31:21.684 --> 00:31:22.405]  It's ridiculous.
[00:31:22.545 --> 00:31:22.965]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[00:31:24.226 --> 00:31:27.469]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[00:31:27.729 --> 00:31:33.154]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[00:31:33.234 --> 00:31:35.336]  This is the organically derived.
[00:31:35.756 --> 00:31:36.657]  This is the real stuff.
[00:31:36.857 --> 00:31:48.327]  I want to warn you, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[00:31:48.347 --> 00:31:50.009]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[00:31:50.689 --> 00:31:51.669]  Then tore it off.
[00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:53.150]  It was numb all the way up here.
[00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.430]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.191]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:58.731]  First it tingled and it came back.
[00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:00.012]  I was like, this is incredible.
[00:32:00.072 --> 00:32:00.892]  But I'm going to warn you.
[00:32:01.092 --> 00:32:05.613]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[00:32:05.793 --> 00:32:09.574]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[00:32:09.774 --> 00:32:12.075]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[00:32:12.315 --> 00:32:14.095]  So it's the building blocks.
[00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:15.296]  And it's the next level.
[00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:16.256]  It's the best you're going to get.
[00:32:16.396 --> 00:32:19.157]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[00:32:19.197 --> 00:32:19.977]  We're getting into supplements.
[00:32:20.217 --> 00:32:22.039]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[00:32:22.179 --> 00:32:27.385]  But mainly people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:32.111]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:34.073]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[00:32:35.114 --> 00:32:35.854]  We're good to go.
[00:33:06.481 --> 00:33:11.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.384 --> 00:33:15.765]  Big Brother.
[00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:17.506]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:18.046 --> 00:33:19.106]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:19.947 --> 00:33:21.367]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:21.627 --> 00:33:22.808]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.288 --> 00:33:27.830]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.777 --> 00:33:38.719]  Ain't nothin' gonna make it happen!
[00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:42.240]  I love that fire all your guns at once.
[00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:12.706]  It's hard to turn Steppenwolf off.
[00:34:12.726 --> 00:34:13.787]  We've got to get serious and do it.
[00:34:15.729 --> 00:34:16.970]  So it's Earth Day 2019.
[00:34:19.673 --> 00:34:20.514]  What is Earth Day?
[00:34:21.135 --> 00:34:29.965]  It was literally created just like the UN and over 50 other organizations by the robber barons, by the Rockefellers, by British intelligence.
[00:34:31.351 --> 00:34:51.707]  And it's about organizing the planet under corporate regulations that they're exempt from, and not letting certain countries have industry, but others can, and having carbon taxes on the West that are surveilled by supercomputers to control every aspect of our lives.
[00:34:52.368 --> 00:34:58.673]  And so basically, it's the establishment saying, we're the saviors of the Earth, and we're going to decide how you live and what you do.
[00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.130]  We're going to tell you you're having too many kids.
[00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.191]  We're going to tell you carbon dioxide's bad.
[00:35:03.211 --> 00:35:04.731]  We're going to tell you capitalism's bad.
[00:35:05.111 --> 00:35:14.233]  Oh, but we're the big mega-rich capitalists who have surveillance capitalism and crony capitalism, which is really just globalism, destroying you.
[00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:17.114]  And then it teaches, don't be competitive.
[00:35:17.174 --> 00:35:17.974]  Don't be rugged.
[00:35:18.054 --> 00:35:18.894]  Don't be strong.
[00:35:19.994 --> 00:35:20.775]  Be placid.
[00:35:20.855 --> 00:35:21.635]  Be a follower.
[00:35:21.895 --> 00:35:22.875]  Don't have children.
[00:35:23.135 --> 00:35:24.255]  Don't have a life force.
[00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.496]  Don't have a will.
[00:35:25.796 --> 00:35:26.736]  Don't have a destiny.
[00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:37.648]  Be good little compliant minions so that the globalists can control the future, so they can choose the future, and so they can chart their course.
[00:35:38.308 --> 00:35:42.491]  Because you're not just riding along with them as they domesticate you like a pig.
[00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:46.474]  You know, pigs are the smartest domesticated animal, undoubtedly.
[00:35:47.575 --> 00:35:47.995]  Every study.
[00:35:48.595 --> 00:35:56.141]  But you know, you come out for a year or so and you feed a piglet after it's not suckling anymore on the sow, on its mommy.
[00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:59.288]  And maybe that Sal's gotten a little old, too.
[00:35:59.328 --> 00:36:03.511]  You kind of shell her to get turned into bacon and hot dogs and everything, and sausage.
[00:36:04.432 --> 00:36:07.394]  They don't notice, even if she's squealing, as you kick her into the back of a car.
[00:36:07.775 --> 00:36:09.376]  Kick her in the back of a trailer.
[00:36:09.937 --> 00:36:11.358]  A couple other pigs to go get slaughtered.
[00:36:11.738 --> 00:36:15.741]  Hung up by their feet, their throats slit, and they squeal and kick and everything else.
[00:36:16.182 --> 00:36:18.244]  Pigs right next to it don't care, they just want some food.
[00:36:18.764 --> 00:36:21.366]  Because they're a lower animal, because they don't stick up for each other.
[00:36:22.187 --> 00:36:25.610]  Now, a wild boar would stick up for other members of its group.
[00:36:27.551 --> 00:36:30.412]  I mean, I guess a group of monkeys is a troop, a bunch of dogs is a pack.
[00:36:31.032 --> 00:36:32.212]  What is a group of pigs?
[00:36:32.832 --> 00:36:36.613]  I know a group of crows is a murder.
[00:36:39.214 --> 00:36:40.054]  What's a gaggle?
[00:36:40.334 --> 00:36:41.735]  All that old English is really interesting.
[00:36:42.015 --> 00:36:43.155]  What's a group of pigs?
[00:36:43.415 --> 00:36:44.655]  The definition of a group of pigs.
[00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:45.836]  It's a what?
[00:36:48.176 --> 00:36:48.796]  A drift.
[00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:51.897]  So you have a whole drift of pigs.
[00:36:51.917 --> 00:36:53.117]  I mean, you can even take a pig.
[00:36:53.818 --> 00:36:55.118]  You can't do this with horses.
[00:36:57.283 --> 00:37:01.326]  And dogs don't like this either, because they actually try to stick together a little bit.
[00:37:02.106 --> 00:37:13.273]  But you can take a pig right into a squeeze chute, 20 feet from other pigs, and you can put the chains around the back of its legs, tighten them up, and then hit that
[00:37:15.362 --> 00:37:16.784]  I'm digressing.
[00:37:16.884 --> 00:37:20.367]  I want to explain leftist and trendies here though.
[00:37:20.407 --> 00:37:21.268]  This is very important.
[00:37:39.022 --> 00:37:40.623]  You're giving that pig pieces of watermelon.
[00:37:40.643 --> 00:37:42.624]  You're giving that pig all the leftovers.
[00:37:43.004 --> 00:37:43.884]  You're taking care of that pig.
[00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:46.586]  It squeals with delight when it sees you.
[00:37:49.947 --> 00:37:51.088]  It's just so excited.
[00:37:51.108 --> 00:37:53.969]  And it doesn't care if you kill the other pigs right in front of it.
[00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:57.111]  In fact, it'll eat its buddies.
[00:37:57.191 --> 00:37:58.251]  It'll eat its brother or sister.
[00:37:58.772 --> 00:38:00.913]  If you fall down and break your neck in a pig pen,
[00:38:01.803 --> 00:38:02.583]  They're gonna eat you.
[00:38:02.603 --> 00:38:08.007]  Oh, they're gonna walk right over like a big ol' vampire and just bite right in and just tear your throat out.
[00:38:08.987 --> 00:38:09.468]  Wee!
[00:38:09.668 --> 00:38:10.868]  Woo!
[00:38:11.269 --> 00:38:12.369]  Woo!
[00:38:12.489 --> 00:38:13.030]  Son!
[00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:18.933]  See, people think you call somebody that's bad a pig, meaning they're greedy.
[00:38:18.993 --> 00:38:19.234]  No, no.
[00:38:19.274 --> 00:38:23.636]  You call them a pig because they'll sell you out in a second.
[00:38:25.597 --> 00:38:27.258]  That's why you call somebody a pig.
[00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:29.680]  Because they're disloyal.
[00:38:31.305 --> 00:38:35.810]  You can have a pig 20 years and pet it every day and give it kisses and feed it strawberries.
[00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.274]  It'll kill you the minute you fall down and get hurt.
[00:38:42.296 --> 00:38:43.698]  Now, back to Earth Day.
[00:38:44.687 --> 00:38:45.608]  Because that's what this is.
[00:38:45.628 --> 00:38:58.142]  You've got all these liberals and trendies, and you go to Whole Foods and it's all these big racks of magazines saying, oh, austerity, being poor is so good, and oh, not competing and not having children is so beautiful.
[00:38:58.583 --> 00:39:03.989]  And I've got big stacks of it in the news today, how altruistic and high and mighty it is.
[00:39:05.555 --> 00:39:07.757]  But what it is, is they've taught total selfishness.
[00:39:07.777 --> 00:39:14.862]  The average millennial is the most selfish, criminal individual who will lie, cheat, steal, virtue signal.
[00:39:15.622 --> 00:39:18.585]  And I'm not saying all millennials are bad, but it's scientifically known.
[00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:22.187]  That millennials don't want a car.
[00:39:22.848 --> 00:39:24.369]  They don't want a boyfriend or girlfriend.
[00:39:24.789 --> 00:39:26.130]  They don't want to give to charity.
[00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.611]  They don't want to work hard.
[00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:29.272]  They don't want to exercise.
[00:39:29.713 --> 00:39:37.158]  They just want to walk around and pose in front of each other and act like they're high and mighty and then be approving to each other.
[00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:48.870]  And tell you, oh, the good job you've done for the right type of light bulb, or the right type of kale you're eating, or... But it's all a bunch of empty, alone people going around virtue signaling to each other.
[00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.270]  A bunch of pigs.
[00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:54.931]  And so that's all this is.
[00:39:55.552 --> 00:40:00.713]  And so the system pats them on the head and is just getting them positioned to be the post-human era.
[00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:04.542]  They got seduced by the technology.
[00:40:04.862 --> 00:40:05.902]  They got sucked in.
[00:40:06.283 --> 00:40:07.243]  They didn't get warned.
[00:40:07.383 --> 00:40:08.324]  They got programmed.
[00:40:08.344 --> 00:40:10.104]  Now, Generation Z is different.
[00:40:10.925 --> 00:40:21.090]  Because the millennials and the leftists above them, they are programming and being so mean to Z, that Z is becoming right-wing.
[00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.411]  Z is becoming libertarian.
[00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:26.312]  Z is becoming pro-life.
[00:40:26.492 --> 00:40:29.934]  Because humans are designed that when you've got bad leadership, you rebel against it.
[00:40:32.383 --> 00:40:41.752]  But the Millennials are just these self-satisfied nerds that want to be in the club, and so they've decided they've built their club.
[00:40:42.132 --> 00:40:44.795]  And see, we don't want to be in their club, so they're upset.
[00:40:46.497 --> 00:40:48.619]  And so they're trying to make us be in the club.
[00:40:49.957 --> 00:40:51.177]  You know, it's how they do this so quickly.
[00:40:51.777 --> 00:40:55.859]  You train them with television, culture, primary education, secondary education.
[00:40:56.139 --> 00:41:07.842]  They bring in the vast majority of very soft, very placid, latchkey kids who in the last 30 years stopped playing sports, stopped playing outside, or they got participation trophies.
[00:41:08.222 --> 00:41:09.382]  Dodgeball was banned.
[00:41:09.742 --> 00:41:12.203]  Running and wrestling was banned.
[00:41:12.463 --> 00:41:13.924]  If you got in a fistfight, you went to jail.
[00:41:15.424 --> 00:41:19.025]  Before, I mean, it was encouraged by the coaches for us to have fistfights.
[00:41:20.114 --> 00:41:22.075]  But see, now it's all changed.
[00:41:23.757 --> 00:41:27.499]  And so you have these domesticated people, but they still have never worked out their aggression.
[00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:29.120]  They've never gone through rites of passage.
[00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:33.584]  So they're like arrested development, five-year-old, spoiled, rotten kids.
[00:41:34.684 --> 00:41:39.107]  But they've been told by the system, you're successful if you do what we say.
[00:41:40.088 --> 00:41:42.230]  So they're the group that commits the most suicide.
[00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.751]  They're the group that, they're dying.
[00:41:44.591 --> 00:41:45.332]  They're dying.
[00:41:47.366 --> 00:41:52.753]  And if you walk down the street and you look at a group of millennials, they look like somebody sucked their soul out.
[00:41:54.895 --> 00:41:55.416]  They're gone.
[00:41:56.317 --> 00:41:58.059]  And their fertility is lowering.
[00:41:58.854 --> 00:42:00.095]  And their IQs are lowering.
[00:42:00.876 --> 00:42:02.917]  And they have way more neurological disorders.
[00:42:02.957 --> 00:42:03.778]  And it's not their fault.
[00:42:04.198 --> 00:42:09.562]  They've been hit with massive loads of synthetic, chemical, and plant-based estrogen.
[00:42:09.963 --> 00:42:23.994]  And they've been hit by the entire system, but then they've been told all their inclinations and their weaknesses are actually good traits so they would adapt to being enslaved and adapt to the new mutagens and believe that their new
[00:42:26.684 --> 00:42:30.665]  State was actually a superior one because the Hollywood system told them it was.
[00:42:31.405 --> 00:42:33.246]  They are the definition of chumps.
[00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:41.588]  Now when we return, I'm going to get into the evidence of this and where the Green Plan goes and what's going to happen to the chumps.
[00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:47.550]  Just like the former head of Facebook said, we designed it to make you depressed and alone and trendy.
[00:42:48.826 --> 00:42:52.954]  Trendy means oppressed and alone and desperate and scared.
[00:42:53.054 --> 00:42:56.521]  A follower that thinks they're free and thinks they're part of the ruling class.
[00:42:56.722 --> 00:43:00.128]  That's why when Trump got in it scared him so much because they're supposed to be the ruling class.
[00:43:04.531 --> 00:43:08.974]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:13.898]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[00:43:14.519 --> 00:43:20.343]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[00:43:20.763 --> 00:43:33.373]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[00:43:34.113 --> 00:43:42.800]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.722]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[00:43:45.062 --> 00:43:46.163]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[00:43:46.203 --> 00:43:47.484]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[00:43:47.664 --> 00:43:48.845]  He doesn't drink anything.
[00:43:49.045 --> 00:43:50.525]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[00:43:51.046 --> 00:43:52.646]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[00:43:52.666 --> 00:43:54.447]  I only have to take one knockout.
[00:43:54.807 --> 00:43:57.408]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[00:43:57.448 --> 00:43:58.308]  This is insane.
[00:43:58.728 --> 00:44:00.349]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:03.149]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.110]  He says, this is totally free.
[00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.991]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:08.871]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[00:44:09.712 --> 00:44:15.653]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[00:44:15.893 --> 00:44:17.234]  All just moderate dose.
[00:44:18.766 --> 00:44:26.754]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[00:44:26.795 --> 00:44:29.177]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:29.237 --> 00:44:30.358]  But thank you for committing.
[00:44:34.404 --> 00:44:37.246]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[00:44:37.626 --> 00:44:40.227]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[00:44:40.247 --> 00:44:45.030]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:51.614]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:54.756]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[00:44:55.096 --> 00:44:56.397]  It's called reap what you sow.
[00:45:06.251 --> 00:45:06.692]  Devil.
[00:45:38.749 --> 00:45:47.715]  Chief Karish did say today that they have reached over 300,000 apprehensions along the southwestern border for this fiscal year alone.
[00:45:48.076 --> 00:45:51.478]  Now specifically here in the RGV, they have seen over 130,000.
[00:45:51.558 --> 00:46:00.865]  CBP today released that they're expecting to apprehend over 55,000 family units for the month of March alone.
[00:46:01.585 --> 00:46:08.769]  The fact of the matter is this is not an emergency and the president's fear-mongering doesn't make it one.
[00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:11.171]  There is no crisis at the border.
[00:46:11.511 --> 00:46:17.494]  I'll state that this is a manufactured crisis and a crisis that manufactured by the Trump administration.
[00:46:17.694 --> 00:46:27.940]  But he clearly understands in his gut what stirs his base and he is determined to inflame these fears regardless of the facts or the effect this will have on the country.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.982]  What's at the core of this crisis is the Trump administration.
[00:46:32.042 --> 00:46:37.725]  The reason the Democrats refuse to call this a crisis is because they see it as an opportunity.
[00:46:37.765 --> 00:46:43.708]  CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our southwest border.
[00:46:43.768 --> 00:46:49.231]  The Mexican Interior Secretary said that they're planning to see come through Mexico the mother of all caravans.
[00:46:49.331 --> 00:46:52.293]  It is very definitely a crisis and the question is what do you do about it?
[00:46:52.313 --> 00:46:53.354]  We will build a wall.
[00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:54.954]  We will build a wall.
[00:46:56.075 --> 00:46:57.576]  We will build a wall.
[00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:09.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.221 --> 00:47:18.442]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:18.922 --> 00:47:24.163]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:25.404 --> 00:47:27.324]  It's the real escape from New York.
[00:47:41.115 --> 00:47:57.187]  If you just joined us, I was laying out how the system literally brainwashed more than half of the millennial generation to want communism and socialism living in the lap of decadent, pre-collapse capitalism.
[00:47:59.849 --> 00:48:00.710]  And now New York...
[00:48:02.884 --> 00:48:17.708]  In major polls, several studies, I've got articles here out of the New York Post, Associated Press, up to 42%, 41.7% of thousands polled say they can't afford to live in New York and plan to leave in the next year.
[00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:21.450]  And what is the establishment's answer?
[00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.731]  Bringing more unskilled laborers for jobs that don't exist.
[00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:26.031]  But don't worry.
[00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:37.316]  Spain had their economy bankrupt in the last 20 years, with a quote, green economy of tearing down buildings they said had a carbon footprint, getting rid of using oil, trying to use windmills.
[00:48:38.457 --> 00:48:48.504]  They're now in a permanent depression, with people under 30 and almost 50% unemployment, and a permanent system of basically revolution.
[00:48:49.945 --> 00:48:54.669]  That's the same thing, but don't worry, de Blasio is part of Earth Day, it's all interconnected, came out.
[00:48:56.024 --> 00:49:11.710]  And announced things that, I mean, if you thought free health care and free welfare for those that don't even want to work, like AOC said, and special bathroom stalls for cows to suck the methane out of their feces and put it into mine shafts, this is going to hurt the earth.
[00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.010]  I'm not kidding.
[00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:22.474]  If you think free health care and free education and no taxes and reparations and free education, I forgot that one,
[00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:34.223]  If you thought that wouldn't bankrupt things and make the other people paying for it go broke, AOC just said it doesn't matter where the money comes from, we'll just do it.
[00:49:35.343 --> 00:49:35.684]  Wow.
[00:49:37.004 --> 00:49:38.805]  After all, the Earth's gonna end in 12 years.
[00:49:39.245 --> 00:49:40.566]  If we don't, give her all the power.
[00:49:41.307 --> 00:49:43.428]  Same thing Beto O'Rourke's been saying, we'll play that in a moment.
[00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:45.149]  But first, de Blasio.
[00:49:46.269 --> 00:49:47.490]  He's up there in a city
[00:49:48.612 --> 00:49:52.035]  That just since he got in, has piles of trash everywhere, rats everywhere.
[00:49:52.395 --> 00:49:54.176]  Everybody I know says, don't go back to New York.
[00:49:54.656 --> 00:49:55.897]  It was pretty good under Giuliani.
[00:49:55.957 --> 00:49:56.738]  It's a great city.
[00:49:56.758 --> 00:49:58.880]  A lot of history, a lot of energy.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.123]  But let me tell you, everybody I know says that they can't even go to New York now.
[00:50:03.143 --> 00:50:06.365]  They say it's falling apart again, just like it was in the 80s.
[00:50:07.326 --> 00:50:13.010]  And de Blasio, just like New York's own Hugo Chavez, is presiding over the same thing.
[00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.932]  Just like Chicago is falling apart.
[00:50:16.172 --> 00:50:16.633]  Just like
[00:50:17.816 --> 00:50:20.978]  San Francisco, or Seattle, or Portland, or L.A.
[00:50:21.258 --> 00:50:22.959]  They do it on purpose.
[00:50:24.299 --> 00:50:28.942]  They want to collapse things to buy it all up for themselves, then they'll clean it up later, they think.
[00:50:29.502 --> 00:50:31.103]  But it's a process they carry out.
[00:50:31.543 --> 00:50:37.426]  So here's the Blasio saying they're going to make every building retrofit and do giant construction projects that'll bankrupt them.
[00:50:38.127 --> 00:50:40.328]  That'll only drive up the rents that cost more.
[00:50:40.888 --> 00:50:41.328]  Here it is.
[00:50:41.948 --> 00:50:43.309]  So we have our own Green New Deal.
[00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:45.630]  It's three very basic ideas.
[00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:50.052]  One, the biggest source of emissions in New York City is buildings.
[00:50:50.432 --> 00:50:52.273]  We're putting clear, strong mandates.
[00:50:52.393 --> 00:50:59.876]  The first of any major city on the earth to say to building owners, you gotta clean up your act, you gotta retrofit, you gotta save energy.
[00:51:00.336 --> 00:51:05.738]  If you don't do it by 2030, there will be serious fines as high as a million dollars or more for the biggest buildings.
[00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:09.640]  And this mandate is going to guarantee that we reduce emissions.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:15.244]  We're going to ban the classic glass and steel skyscrapers, which are incredibly inefficient.
[00:51:36.178 --> 00:51:38.943]  I can't listen to any more of it.
[00:51:52.324 --> 00:51:52.864]  You understand.
[00:51:53.384 --> 00:51:54.865]  You heard him say the first city in the world.
[00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.485]  This is designed to bankrupt us.
[00:51:57.085 --> 00:52:01.386]  India, Mexico, China, and 160 plus other third world countries.
[00:52:01.626 --> 00:52:03.266]  They're not going to make any of these changes.
[00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:06.847]  By the way, toxic waste being dumped in the ocean is bad.
[00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:09.448]  Splicing humans and animals is bad.
[00:52:09.728 --> 00:52:15.629]  Having terminator seeds now in hundreds of variety of plants where the plants don't produce seeds anymore that can make new plants.
[00:52:16.912 --> 00:52:18.833]  Having giant nuclear reactors everywhere.
[00:52:18.873 --> 00:52:21.935]  Having giant CERN reactors they admit could blow the planet up.
[00:52:22.256 --> 00:52:22.576]  Literally.
[00:52:22.796 --> 00:52:25.478]  They go, well, it could cause a black hole or a giant explosion.
[00:52:25.638 --> 00:52:29.340]  I mean, what do you think slamming uranium and plutonium together does?
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.881]  They're doing that at CERN.
[00:52:31.662 --> 00:52:33.443]  And thousands of other insane things.
[00:52:35.922 --> 00:52:36.522]  So what is this?
[00:52:36.602 --> 00:52:38.223]  It's a scientific takeover.
[00:52:38.303 --> 00:52:40.164]  They believe the planet is obsolete.
[00:52:40.344 --> 00:52:41.825]  They believe they're going to merge with machines.
[00:52:42.605 --> 00:52:43.646]  They're mad scientists.
[00:52:43.946 --> 00:52:46.327]  They're testing everything on everyone right now.
[00:52:46.868 --> 00:52:57.393]  And the breakaway civilization is tax-exempt, regulatory-exempt, diplomatic immunity above the law, but it's making all of us be under massive regulations and massive control.
[00:52:57.933 --> 00:53:00.555]  The UN exempts itself from carbon taxes.
[00:53:00.815 --> 00:53:02.796]  The EU bureaucracy exempts itself.
[00:53:03.116 --> 00:53:04.517]  And they'll all be exempt as well.
[00:53:05.452 --> 00:53:07.533]  It's like when you see a cop car, it says tax-exempt.
[00:53:07.774 --> 00:53:09.134]  Okay, fine, that's the cop car.
[00:53:10.876 --> 00:53:14.278]  But the point is, these are corporate rulers who are tax-exempt.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:17.860]  Think about that.
[00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:22.303]  Think about that long, and think about that hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:23.164 --> 00:53:27.567]  So they get all the benefits of the taxes and regulations, but none of the cost.
[00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.353]  They call Soros a philanthropist.
[00:53:31.393 --> 00:53:32.716]  They call David Rockefeller a philanthropist.
[00:53:32.736 --> 00:53:34.420]  They put their money in tax-free foundations.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.562]  They pay no tax.
[00:53:37.961 --> 00:53:39.122]  They know what they're doing.
[00:53:39.682 --> 00:53:40.302]  They're monsters.
[00:53:41.223 --> 00:53:43.324]  And so here's some of the articles right here.
[00:53:43.344 --> 00:53:45.605]  14 reasons millennials are having fewer babies.
[00:53:46.245 --> 00:53:47.005]  It's for the earth.
[00:53:47.065 --> 00:53:47.686]  It's cool.
[00:53:47.946 --> 00:53:48.806]  They have more fun.
[00:53:48.866 --> 00:53:49.507]  Kids are trouble.
[00:53:50.087 --> 00:53:51.388]  That's liberal trendyism.
[00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:52.088]  Kids suck.
[00:53:52.988 --> 00:53:56.010]  But they love children so much, the ones they're unable to abort.
[00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.911]  They keep the babies comfortable.
[00:53:59.091 --> 00:54:00.212]  Little blood ball.
[00:54:01.465 --> 00:54:05.087]  For some millennials, climate change clock ticks louder than biological.
[00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.388]  That's another article.
[00:54:06.468 --> 00:54:07.069]  NBC News.
[00:54:07.129 --> 00:54:08.290]  Don't have children for the earth.
[00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:14.394]  But bring in the lowest of the low out of the third world to replace the West.
[00:54:16.315 --> 00:54:20.438]  Don't bring in the high IQ, well earners, hard working folks from Latin America or Asia.
[00:54:20.698 --> 00:54:21.759]  Bring in the worst.
[00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:24.120]  Imagine if we were trying to export our worst.
[00:54:25.641 --> 00:54:28.063]  Millennials are having less sex than any generation in 60 years.
[00:54:28.423 --> 00:54:29.384]  Here's why it matters.
[00:54:29.944 --> 00:54:30.485]  LA Times.
[00:54:31.974 --> 00:54:32.895]  Yep, they told the truth.
[00:54:32.915 --> 00:54:35.137]  They don't want anybody to pay for their social security.
[00:54:36.418 --> 00:54:38.099]  That's because you're not going to get social security.
[00:54:38.139 --> 00:54:42.503]  Millennials are being taught that you kill grandma, you kill grandpa, you don't take care of people.
[00:54:43.304 --> 00:54:44.145]  Remember, they're selfish.
[00:54:44.805 --> 00:54:45.926]  They're just going to... Oh!
[00:54:46.267 --> 00:54:47.067]  Soylent Green.
[00:54:47.107 --> 00:54:48.008]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:54:48.408 --> 00:54:54.053]  World Net Daily has links to the state of Washington, their House of Representatives.
[00:54:54.634 --> 00:54:57.556]  State poised to legalize human composting.
[00:54:58.482 --> 00:54:58.882]  That's right.
[00:54:58.902 --> 00:55:00.023]  They're going to put a tax on it.
[00:55:00.083 --> 00:55:03.225]  I've already heard of this being announced by the Feds before under Obama, but they never did it.
[00:55:03.586 --> 00:55:05.387]  Where they'll take your body, they'll process it.
[00:55:05.467 --> 00:55:08.489]  If you want to be buried or whatever, there's a big tax associated with it.
[00:55:08.889 --> 00:55:16.494]  If not, you're put through a carbon neutral program and then you're composted onto animal or human plants.
[00:55:16.695 --> 00:55:20.017]  Plants that are being grown for animal or human consumption.
[00:55:20.257 --> 00:55:21.498]  And it says it all right here.
[00:55:23.166 --> 00:55:38.496]  In the World Net Daily article, Charlton Heston's 1973 film Soylent Green, Charlton Heston's character in the iconic 1973 movie Soylent Green famously didn't take well to the news of the ubiquitous green food reflected in the film's title was composed of human beings.
[00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:42.559]  But now the food you eat will be grown off of that.
[00:55:43.019 --> 00:55:44.620]  That's one small step to the rest of it.
[00:55:46.786 --> 00:55:48.207]  The kids are so over it.
[00:55:48.627 --> 00:55:55.193]  That's right, they're used to an Uber coming that'll be driverless soon, and they don't know how to do math, they have a calculator, and they don't know how to do anything.
[00:55:55.213 --> 00:56:05.921]  Everything's just prepaid, everything's already done, they just waddle around and work at big tech companies who are just keeping them isolated and controlled while big tech takes over, while AI gets ready to kill them.
[00:56:07.362 --> 00:56:11.946]  They're just being put into kind of a little, oh, play ping pong, drink beer, we're the ruling class.
[00:56:13.905 --> 00:56:16.449]  while you're being prepared for humanity being made obsolescent.
[00:56:16.469 --> 00:56:26.467]  But the AI is first buying you off, kind of stinging you like a spider or a wasp does, biting you first to neutralize you, so it can then tie you up in the web and then take its time on you.
[00:56:27.776 --> 00:56:29.957]  Before you're ground up and used for fertilizer, for whatever.
[00:56:30.578 --> 00:56:31.778]  So they don't want cars anymore?
[00:56:31.898 --> 00:56:32.739]  Oh, they want scooters.
[00:56:32.999 --> 00:56:34.219]  Wants children's toys.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:39.782]  Now the left's putting them out in every city with taxpayer-funded so everyone stops using cars and rides on scooters.
[00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.584]  Scooter critics rage against the machines.
[00:56:42.984 --> 00:56:43.625]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:56:44.525 --> 00:56:46.166]  So see, that's all any of this is.
[00:56:46.226 --> 00:56:54.711]  A record depression in millennials, record depression in children, record depression with all the screen time because they're alone and they're slaves, domesticated, waiting for the slaughter.
[00:56:55.231 --> 00:56:56.812]  But they've got all the big globalist money.
[00:56:56.932 --> 00:56:57.272]  We don't.
[00:56:58.931 --> 00:57:05.999]  We need your support by spreading the word and by financially saying I'm going to sign up for AutoShip so I don't forget to support InfoWars every month.
[00:57:07.101 --> 00:57:17.292]  I'm going to get an additional 10% off and today is the last day to get apparel, t-shirts, patches, ball caps, hoodies, hats, everything
[00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:22.755]  50% off and I'm wearing the iconic shirt today.
[00:57:22.775 --> 00:57:24.316]  InfoWars Resist Tyranny.
[00:57:24.537 --> 00:57:25.397]  It's one of my favorites.
[00:57:25.717 --> 00:57:26.998]  It's got a great snake on the back.
[00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:28.560]  InfoWars.com.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:29.340]  The original 13 colonies.
[00:57:31.176 --> 00:57:32.957]  It's got 36 reviews, 100% reviews.
[00:57:33.798 --> 00:57:34.679]  It's a great shirt.
[00:57:35.139 --> 00:57:39.062]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:39.102 --> 00:57:39.722]  Last day.
[00:57:40.082 --> 00:57:44.665]  And there are some new specials that I haven't even told you about yet at Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:44.685 --> 00:57:45.126]  That's right.
[00:57:45.486 --> 00:57:50.049]  The best-selling Rainforest 25% off with a free bottle of Knockout.
[00:57:50.209 --> 00:57:50.629]  That's right.
[00:57:52.631 --> 00:57:52.951]  It's simple.
[00:57:55.225 --> 00:57:56.206]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[00:57:56.427 --> 00:57:57.969]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.369]  Hello.
[00:57:58.549 --> 00:58:03.436]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[00:58:03.656 --> 00:58:04.277]  It's amazing.
[00:58:04.397 --> 00:58:08.682]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever.
[00:58:08.883 --> 00:58:13.148]  And the antihistamines sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never cause
[00:58:13.348 --> 00:58:14.889]  This is a known patent out of France.
[00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:22.753]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[00:58:22.793 --> 00:58:25.775]  How fast did it take for Pollen Block to kick in for you?
[00:58:43.024 --> 00:58:46.445]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[00:58:46.565 --> 00:58:47.286]  It just works.
[00:58:47.466 --> 00:58:53.688]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms.
[00:58:53.808 --> 00:58:58.010]  And even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:00.571]  Polonblock works every single time.
[00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:01.832]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[00:59:01.892 --> 00:59:05.255]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[00:59:05.435 --> 00:59:07.577]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[00:59:07.657 --> 00:59:08.638]  It's very complex.
[00:59:08.658 --> 00:59:09.459]  They don't even know why.
[00:59:09.519 --> 00:59:12.822]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[00:59:13.402 --> 00:59:20.028]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[00:59:20.209 --> 00:59:21.930]  I go out and I do market research.
[00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.492]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[00:59:24.673 --> 00:59:26.014]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[00:59:26.334 --> 00:59:34.458]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[00:59:34.478 --> 00:59:36.119]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[00:59:36.219 --> 00:59:41.442]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[00:59:41.982 --> 00:59:42.522]  It's not here.
[00:59:42.942 --> 00:59:46.364]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[00:59:46.424 --> 00:59:47.765]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.329 --> 01:00:03.033]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:08.135 --> 01:00:21.102]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:39.240]  Along this current trajectory, there will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call home today.
[01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:44.202]  There is food grown in this country that will no longer prosper in these soils.
[01:00:44.702 --> 01:00:53.924]  There is going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people from countries that are literally uninhabitable or underwater that are above the sea right now.
[01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.405]  This is our final chance.
[01:00:56.745 --> 01:00:59.607]  The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this.
[01:01:00.007 --> 01:01:05.910]  That we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis.
[01:01:06.071 --> 01:01:09.112]  The crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[01:01:09.793 --> 01:01:13.455]  I think that the part of it that is generational is that
[01:01:14.531 --> 01:01:26.020]  Millennials and people and, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like, the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:34.886]  And your biggest issue is, your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?
[01:01:35.367 --> 01:01:37.729]  And like, this is the war.
[01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:39.030]  This is our World War II.
[01:01:40.691 --> 01:01:41.892]  This is our World War II.
[01:01:44.229 --> 01:01:44.949]  So it's Earth Day 2019.
[01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:55.172]  Total UN fraud about a global government taking control of every aspect of our lives and shutting down the West but putting no regulations on communist China and others.
[01:01:55.632 --> 01:01:56.772]  This is our World War II.
[01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:57.853]  This is our World War IV.
[01:01:58.533 --> 01:02:00.433]  The Cold War was World War III.
[01:02:00.533 --> 01:02:01.614]  I agree with the CIA on that.
[01:02:01.974 --> 01:02:05.315]  World War IV is an economic war being carried out.
[01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:12.677]  And when you look at the Hillbop cult, they were a bunch of computer programmers out in Silicon Valley.
[01:02:12.697 --> 01:02:13.317]  They were prominent.
[01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:16.540]  And they said, you must be gay and you must cut your genitals off.
[01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:22.764]  And you must wear Nike tennis shoes and drink vodka and barbiturates and fly up to the comet.
[01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:27.087]  Because the world's going to end in 12 years.
[01:02:27.127 --> 01:02:28.148]  They were saying 12 years.
[01:02:28.568 --> 01:02:30.369]  And you can fly up to the comet.
[01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:33.932]  It's their only chance to get to the spaceship.
[01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:37.635]  Jim Jones told them the world was going to end in a decade.
[01:02:38.135 --> 01:02:41.798]  And you need to drink that Kool-Aid right now to get beamed up to Jesus.
[01:02:42.972 --> 01:03:06.888]  And so when you see the New Democratic talking point that the Earth is going to be gone or we're all going to be dead in 12 years, I mean, Al Gore in 2003 and 2004 when he came out with an inconvenient load of baloney, he said that major coastal cities would be several feet underwater by 2017 and the northern and southern ice caps would be completely melted.
[01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:10.371]  Now, the northern and southern ice caps
[01:03:11.738 --> 01:03:13.079]  Are the largest ever recorded.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:14.680]  You know why?
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.862]  We've only had satellites up there that got good readings for 50 years.
[01:03:20.204 --> 01:03:22.946]  So in the last 50 years, this is what happens in the summer.
[01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:23.846]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[01:03:24.387 --> 01:03:30.431]  In the summer, the caps get smaller because a lot of it melts in the summer.
[01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:32.572]  And in the winter, they get bigger.
[01:03:35.234 --> 01:03:39.317]  But what's being recorded in the winter is the largest ice caps for
[01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:43.050]  The Arctic, that's in the North, and the Antarctic in the South.
[01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:46.952]  The largest ever recorded.
[01:03:47.933 --> 01:03:56.397]  But they'll point, every year in the summer, in the Arctic, by August, it's the opposite, the Antarctic, it's reversed, and they'll go, look!
[01:03:57.097 --> 01:03:58.057]  It's collapsing!
[01:03:58.097 --> 01:03:59.978]  The giant glaciers are collapsing!
[01:04:00.478 --> 01:04:02.259]  Glaciers always are collapsing!
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.380]  And the last ice age, 15,000 years ago,
[01:04:06.937 --> 01:04:14.042]  You ever wonder why you're out in the middle of a field in, like, Iowa, and there'll just be a giant boulder and a bunch of round rocks everywhere mixed in with the soil?
[01:04:14.422 --> 01:04:26.771]  That's because glaciers came through over all those millennium and ground those rocks into perfect... and those will be rocks from Canada that are a thousand miles south in areas of Kansas.
[01:04:27.571 --> 01:04:29.413]  It's where the Ice Age basically stopped.
[01:04:29.813 --> 01:04:30.994]  It's up by the Oklahoma border.
[01:04:32.466 --> 01:04:36.068]  You'll just be driving along and there's just big round boulders everywhere because that pushed it all down.
[01:04:36.268 --> 01:04:37.069]  That's what they do.
[01:04:37.369 --> 01:04:37.869]  They go, look!
[01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:39.170]  They're melting in the summer!
[01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:40.210]  Run for the hills!
[01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:41.111]  We're all dead!
[01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:41.191]  God!
[01:04:41.331 --> 01:04:42.472]  Help us!
[01:04:44.012 --> 01:04:45.293]  We're all dead in 12 years!
[01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:48.635]  This is Jim Jones cult garbage!
[01:04:48.755 --> 01:04:56.019]  And they're just brainwashing us like, it didn't work saying the cities would flood in 10 years like Gore said.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.201]  Well then just say, the world ends.
[01:04:59.681 --> 01:05:01.102]  Just do whatever they say or you're dead.
[01:05:04.503 --> 01:05:11.249]  Both President Obama and Hillary Clinton found it impossible to say the words radical Islam.
[01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:13.230]  Radical Islamic terrorists.
[01:05:14.131 --> 01:05:16.273]  And she won't even mention the word.
[01:05:16.633 --> 01:05:18.154]  And nor will President Obama.
[01:05:18.234 --> 01:05:19.195]  He won't use the term.
[01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:22.058]  Or speak anything negative about Islam.
[01:05:22.158 --> 01:05:29.624]  I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
[01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:37.327]  And now after the horrible terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, strangely, they cannot seem to use the word Christian.
[01:05:38.188 --> 01:05:49.072]  Obama, Clinton, and ABC News have all used the word Easter Worshipper, as if an anti-Christian PR firm is feeding them all talking points.
[01:05:49.592 --> 01:05:50.112]  Strange.
[01:05:50.593 --> 01:05:55.815]  At this point, it really just seems obvious what side these people are all working for.
[01:06:17.552 --> 01:06:25.055]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:06:26.035 --> 01:06:29.936]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:34.198]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:36.099]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.428 --> 01:07:01.748]  All right.
[01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:06.430]  We have a lot of stunning, big breaking news.
[01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:20.395]  And quite frankly, so much of it has come in that I'm going to try to refocus, because this news is so momentous, and come back in about five minutes after this key report and cover it.
[01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:22.996]  I was going to play this report next hour, but it's a very important report.
[01:07:23.016 --> 01:07:24.017]  I'm going to play it now.
[01:07:25.489 --> 01:07:38.445]  And then I'm going to give you the new breaking news that has just come out that just went live on newswars.com and infowars.com and Paul's new great site that I'm really, really proud of, summit.news.
[01:07:39.507 --> 01:07:40.868]  And again, Paul still writes for us.
[01:07:40.928 --> 01:07:41.649]  We're good buddies.
[01:07:42.722 --> 01:07:43.422]  I want to explain this.
[01:07:43.842 --> 01:08:02.866]  My idea, years ago, was, Paul, you need to do your own thing, part of the time, so you feel good about it, so you have fun, show your own personality, because you've been working with me 19 years, and I can tell sometimes you don't want to be in my shadow, and you're not in my shadow, and sometimes you get penalized because of all the demonization I've been under.
[01:08:03.266 --> 01:08:09.307]  I'd like you to be your own person, which he took like a duck to water, or a fish to water.
[01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:17.216]  And he's like, well, yeah, but don't even plug Summit then because, you know, that's mine and I don't want any help on it.
[01:08:17.336 --> 01:08:18.898]  And I just, and it's very successful.
[01:08:18.918 --> 01:08:21.660]  It's had millions of visitors in just the first three weeks.
[01:08:22.521 --> 01:08:33.010]  But no, I am going to plug it and I am proud of it because that's what real leadership is, is building the next generation and the next generation and seeing them launch things.
[01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:34.631]  And it's a good looking site.
[01:08:34.812 --> 01:08:36.233]  For TV viewers, click on one of the articles.
[01:08:37.924 --> 01:08:39.045]  Really good, nice design.
[01:08:39.065 --> 01:08:42.027]  I think I'm going to have Paul redesign InfoWars for me.
[01:08:43.608 --> 01:08:44.949]  But that's what it's all about.
[01:08:44.969 --> 01:08:52.314]  There's a lot of news at Summit.News that is not on InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com, so please bookmark that.
[01:08:52.594 --> 01:08:57.597]  And here's the even better part about it, which is I first saw the deplatforming coming.
[01:08:58.778 --> 01:09:04.002]  Paul doing his own thing, and out there, that gets around all the sensors and controllers more.
[01:09:04.898 --> 01:09:07.579]  And so it's not getting censored on Twitter or Facebook or blocked.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:22.165]  And so they want to try to censor it, they'll have to make up their new story about Paul, but they don't just get to attach it to me because I have nothing to do with it other than the fact that, you know, Paul's sitting in the nest and he's already done a lot of good stuff and I just kind of came over and just kicked him out of the nest.
[01:09:23.066 --> 01:09:25.207]  Because that's what I want to do.
[01:09:25.447 --> 01:09:26.707]  Look, I'll be honest with the audience.
[01:09:31.049 --> 01:09:32.290]  I don't want to be doing this in 10 years.
[01:09:33.223 --> 01:09:34.344]  And it's not that I'm even lazy.
[01:09:34.444 --> 01:09:35.804]  It's that this is all I do.
[01:09:35.924 --> 01:09:36.485]  I sleep.
[01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:37.966]  I have dreams about the New World Order.
[01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:39.166]  All I do is fight them.
[01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.708]  But you know, Mark of the Beast, world government, it's all coming.
[01:09:41.748 --> 01:09:43.589]  You all know I never, I can't retire.
[01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:51.233]  But I have to somehow help launch people that have the potential to do as good as I've done or better.
[01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:53.814]  I'm not here trying to be the number one host.
[01:09:54.535 --> 01:09:56.756]  I'm not here trying to be the big swing and you know what.
[01:09:58.004 --> 01:09:59.785]  I'm trying to get the globalists off our backs.
[01:10:00.285 --> 01:10:02.305]  I'm trying to at least ban partial birth abortion.
[01:10:02.325 --> 01:10:04.766]  Because see, they're pushing the envelope the other way.
[01:10:05.446 --> 01:10:07.667]  The Overton window to kill babies after they're born.
[01:10:09.268 --> 01:10:10.948]  I just want to stop the human-animal hybrids.
[01:10:11.048 --> 01:10:20.131]  I want to stop the admitted Department of Energy program that Clapper admits is spraying massive tons of aluminum dioxide into the air every day.
[01:10:20.471 --> 01:10:21.271]  Added to jet fuel.
[01:10:21.311 --> 01:10:23.392]  And I got the patents, the contracts, it's all admitted.
[01:10:24.815 --> 01:10:26.015]  I just want my kids to have a future.
[01:10:27.316 --> 01:10:33.118]  And so I'm excited about Summit.News as well, and some other projects other folks are involved in.
[01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:35.699]  It's very, very exciting.
[01:10:35.719 --> 01:10:38.620]  I mean, I feel good knowing Zero Hedge is out there.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.040]  I feel good knowing DrudgeReport.com is out there.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:41.581]  I feel good.
[01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:45.142]  Let's go ahead and go to Greg Reese's report, and we'll be back with the really big news.
[01:10:45.162 --> 01:10:45.542]  Stay with us.
[01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:54.450]  Islam is an ideology based on the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith.
[01:10:55.590 --> 01:11:04.837]  While it is taught that the Quran is the literal word of God as taught by the Prophet Muhammad, we know that it was written after Muhammad died.
[01:11:06.338 --> 01:11:14.384]  It was assembled and officially released during the first three caliphates by a priest class of Islamic warlords.
[01:11:15.965 --> 01:11:34.473]  Curiously, several of the symbols chosen to represent Islam were prominent symbols in the Roman Catholic Church, such as the Babylonian symbol for ball, the all-seeing eye, the seal of Melchizedek, and the Virgin Mother.
[01:11:36.753 --> 01:11:46.515]  A good Muslim is expected to accept the Quran and the Hadith as the word of God, and to emulate Muhammad as the perfect man.
[01:11:47.695 --> 01:12:01.358]  And as you study these books to learn how Muhammad lived his life, you will learn that the great prophet was a slave owner, a spousal abuser, a pedophile, and a polygamist.
[01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:11.712]  The Quran will teach you to fight and enslave all non-believers, and to never be friends with Jews or Christians.
[01:12:13.092 --> 01:12:20.556]  The Quran will teach you that going to war against Jews and Christians is virtuous, and that war is deceit.
[01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:28.539]  According to Islam, lying to non-believers is a virtue.
[01:12:30.549 --> 01:12:35.211]  Lying is such a virtue in Islam that there are four different varieties taught.
[01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:43.474]  Taqiyyah, for example, is a lie to advance the cause of Islam by gaining the trust of non-believers.
[01:12:45.275 --> 01:12:56.079]  When Muhammad died, the Islamic priest class made it their priority to subjugate all Muslims, to murder, rape, and enslave the non-believers.
[01:12:58.687 --> 01:13:02.852]  And establish severe Islamic law in every land on earth.
[01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:10.920]  Over the next 1,400 years, millions of Christians and Jews were taken as slaves.
[01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:16.626]  Judeo-Christian societies were destroyed and replaced with Islam.
[01:13:18.263 --> 01:13:23.785]  When Rome finally retaliated, they ultimately failed to take back the Holy Lands.
[01:13:24.686 --> 01:13:28.387]  The Crusades were brief and mild compared to the Islamic Caliphates.
[01:13:28.807 --> 01:13:35.130]  And yet, most Americans hear all about the Crusades, but nothing about the Islamic Caliphates.
[01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:38.951]  We are often told there is no such thing as Jihad.
[01:13:40.192 --> 01:13:43.033]  This should be alarming to anyone outside of Islam.
[01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:50.206]  The Islamic ideology of conquest has inspired other monsters in history.
[01:13:50.706 --> 01:14:03.395]  When the KKK was reformed in 1915, it was modeled after Islam, and their doctrine was named the Koran, which according to Klan traditions, means Koran.
[01:14:04.476 --> 01:14:11.321]  During World War II, the Nazi SS converted to Islam and aligned themselves with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:19.486]  With much help from Barack Obama, the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated the Democratic Party in America.
[01:14:20.327 --> 01:14:26.891]  Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Keith Ellison identify themselves with Islam.
[01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:36.359]  They were sworn into Congress using the Quran, which means they can legally lie to the American people so long as it benefits Islam.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:43.486]  They are openly aligned with organizations that support seeing Islamic law practiced in America.
[01:14:44.427 --> 01:14:58.012]  Challenging American freedom from within, these elected representatives attack Christians and Jews while scolding American citizens as racists and Islamophobes if we dare question their loyalties.
[01:14:59.092 --> 01:15:04.474]  Those who understand Islam can clearly see that jihad has come to America.
[01:15:05.255 --> 01:15:14.551]  In a 2011 poll, 24% of Muslims believe that military attacks against civilian non-believers is justified.
[01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:23.968]  Moderate Muslims claim the Quran is misunderstood and that inspiring jihad is not its purpose.
[01:15:25.048 --> 01:15:33.771]  But the difference between a religion that accidentally inspires mass murder and one that deliberately inspires mass murder is meaningless.
[01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:36.672]  Islam will never stop.
[01:15:37.552 --> 01:15:44.254]  And eventually, the need to defend our American way of life will outweigh the fear of being called racist.
[01:15:45.214 --> 01:15:47.837]  The question is, will it be too late?
[01:15:49.158 --> 01:15:52.000]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.243]  Now, guard yourself for true.
[01:15:56.704 --> 01:15:57.505]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:57.745 --> 01:16:00.428]  We are Western Civilization Resistance.
[01:16:04.013 --> 01:16:10.955]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA.
[01:16:11.135 --> 01:16:12.916]  That's the antioxidant that's next level.
[01:16:13.096 --> 01:16:21.918]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:22.798]  It's ridiculous.
[01:16:22.919 --> 01:16:23.339]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[01:16:24.619 --> 01:16:27.861]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:33.524]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, it'll be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic's expensive.
[01:16:33.624 --> 01:16:35.725]  This is the organically derived.
[01:16:36.145 --> 01:16:37.046]  This is the real stuff.
[01:16:37.246 --> 01:16:47.131]  I want to warn you, though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there where it cut off.
[01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:48.692]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[01:16:48.712 --> 01:16:50.393]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[01:16:50.993 --> 01:16:51.833]  And then tore it off.
[01:16:52.093 --> 01:16:53.554]  It was numb all the way up here.
[01:16:53.674 --> 01:16:55.815]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[01:16:56.035 --> 01:16:57.575]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[01:16:57.635 --> 01:16:59.116]  First it tingled, and it came back.
[01:16:59.316 --> 01:17:00.396]  I was like, this is incredible.
[01:17:00.456 --> 01:17:01.277]  But I'm going to warn you.
[01:17:01.477 --> 01:17:06.018]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[01:17:06.198 --> 01:17:09.959]  This is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.460]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.481]  So it's the building blocks.
[01:17:14.761 --> 01:17:15.681]  And it's the next level.
[01:17:15.721 --> 01:17:16.642]  It's the best you're going to get.
[01:17:16.782 --> 01:17:19.543]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:20.363]  We're getting into supplements.
[01:17:20.603 --> 01:17:22.445]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[01:17:22.585 --> 01:17:27.791]  But mainly people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[01:17:27.971 --> 01:17:32.517]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[01:17:32.837 --> 01:17:34.479]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.301]  We're good to go.
[01:18:03.487 --> 01:18:11.572]  If Joe Biden actually runs for office, and this is taken seriously, all the videos of Joe groping children and women would go viral.
[01:18:12.093 --> 01:18:12.793]  Now here we are, 2019.
[01:18:19.364 --> 01:18:23.267]  I've always tried to be, in my career, I've always tried to make a human connection.
[01:18:23.987 --> 01:18:25.888]  That's my responsibility, I think.
[01:18:25.908 --> 01:18:30.791]  I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and run by the shoulders and say, you can do this.
[01:18:31.652 --> 01:18:36.455]  And whether they're women, men, young, old, it's the way I've always been.
[01:18:36.475 --> 01:18:39.296]  It's the way I've tried to show I care about them and I listen.
[01:18:40.277 --> 01:18:44.780]  And over the years, knowing what I've been through, the things that I've faced, I've found that
[01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:47.781]  Joe is a hands-on kind of guy.
[01:18:47.981 --> 01:18:56.228]  I don't think it rises to the point of what we've been listening to about Harvey Weinstein and the rest of it.
[01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:07.866]  No.
[01:19:08.186 --> 01:19:11.008]  There's a certain kind of retail politician that loves people.
[01:19:11.228 --> 01:19:12.649]  I would put Bill Clinton in that category.
[01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:13.990]  I would put my father in that category.
[01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:17.072]  I would certainly put Joe Biden in that category.
[01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.453]  I always wonder when these things come out, what is the motive?
[01:19:19.473 --> 01:19:19.994]  I get it.
[01:19:20.014 --> 01:19:20.994]  I get it.
[01:19:21.054 --> 01:19:23.516]  Well, I don't want Joe to stop doing that.
[01:19:23.596 --> 01:19:24.036]  I don't either.
[01:19:24.516 --> 01:19:24.777]  Wait.
[01:19:25.097 --> 01:19:26.878]  Three more women have come forward.
[01:19:28.339 --> 01:19:30.220]  Three more women have come forward.
[01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:40.721]  We told you, the floodgates would open on all Joe Biden's serial groping if he would ever run for president.
[01:19:41.161 --> 01:19:42.642]  And the floodgates have opened.
[01:19:58.013 --> 01:19:58.753]  InfoWars.
[01:19:59.114 --> 01:20:00.695]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:20:05.937 --> 01:20:08.554]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.377 --> 01:20:29.378]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:20:30.098 --> 01:20:32.279]  Run on for a long time.
[01:20:33.019 --> 01:20:35.100]  Run on for a long time.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:38.301]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:20:38.821 --> 01:20:41.302]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[01:20:41.322 --> 01:20:43.003]  Alright, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:20:43.423 --> 01:20:45.624]  Bunch of big stuff just broke.
[01:20:45.664 --> 01:20:54.307]  A lot of stuff I haven't gotten to yet I'm about to cover, but I want to open the phones up for first-time callers who are Muslims.
[01:20:56.141 --> 01:21:02.105]  And who think I'm wrong about all these Islamic attacks, and who think maybe Sri Lanka wasn't Muslims, like CNN's saying.
[01:21:02.786 --> 01:21:03.166]  Seriously.
[01:21:03.647 --> 01:21:05.268]  Because I have a gentleman who I respect.
[01:21:05.348 --> 01:21:05.908]  I know who he is.
[01:21:05.988 --> 01:21:07.189]  I know people that actually know him.
[01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:10.552]  He was in the army, decorated, got injured in the military.
[01:21:11.653 --> 01:21:13.634]  They plan to set him up in the Fort Hood thing.
[01:21:13.654 --> 01:21:15.195]  He exposed that CIA operation.
[01:21:15.215 --> 01:21:16.516]  I don't know if I can go this far.
[01:21:16.556 --> 01:21:19.659]  He does know a lot of people that I know, who I was able to confirm.
[01:21:19.679 --> 01:21:21.400]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:21:22.361 --> 01:21:24.942]  We're going to have Zachary Claiwan joining us, and he's
[01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.480]  Moroccan, comes from a prominent family.
[01:21:29.201 --> 01:21:36.030]  And of course, places like Morocco or places like Jordan, they leave Christians alone and they're more cultured and all the rest of it.
[01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:38.513]  And I get North Africa's barbarous, the Middle East.
[01:21:38.933 --> 01:21:43.059]  And so the whole world's been barbarous, but he was trying to get on the show yesterday.
[01:21:44.192 --> 01:21:49.917]  When I was, you know, going after Islam and how the left's allied with it and, you know, covering up these attacks and saying, hey, what about the CIA?
[01:21:50.658 --> 01:21:52.199]  And the left always funding radical Islam.
[01:21:52.219 --> 01:21:53.400]  And I'm like, well, you got me there.
[01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:54.141]  That's true.
[01:21:54.181 --> 01:21:56.563]  That's been going on pre-Trump.
[01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.953]  And Trump's been trying to stop that and get Saudi Arabia to quit it.
[01:22:00.674 --> 01:22:02.675]  And so he is a smart guy from the inside.
[01:22:02.715 --> 01:22:07.597]  I mean, he knows a lot of famous people whose names I'm not, you know, wanting to name.
[01:22:07.637 --> 01:22:15.842]  And by famous, I mean interesting people in the military, interesting people in politics, interesting people in space, exploration.
[01:22:16.462 --> 01:22:21.785]  I mean, people like Louis Farrakhan, just is one name I can say, but a lot of others.
[01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:29.187]  So he's an interesting guy and he has given us a lot of good information that wasn't classified but then tied him with stuff already had.
[01:22:29.407 --> 01:22:30.247]  So he's a smart guy.
[01:22:32.928 --> 01:22:46.212]  It's just that, I mean, I think we should not show the other side but get a perspective on what is it like to be a Muslim who doesn't want to blow people up and kill people and who doesn't want to do this stuff to women.
[01:22:46.392 --> 01:22:47.792]  Because there are a lot of Muslims that are like that.
[01:22:49.356 --> 01:22:50.757]  And you call them, I guess, heretics?
[01:22:52.338 --> 01:22:52.979]  Or maybe not.
[01:22:53.059 --> 01:22:56.201]  The thing is, a lot of Muslims will call them heretics and come after them.
[01:22:57.642 --> 01:23:00.364]  So I want to open the phones up specifically for Muslims.
[01:23:00.464 --> 01:23:03.106]  You could be kind of American black Muslims.
[01:23:03.126 --> 01:23:04.147]  Let's have a different vein.
[01:23:04.207 --> 01:23:05.748]  You could be a Sufi.
[01:23:05.768 --> 01:23:06.808]  You could be a Shia.
[01:23:06.868 --> 01:23:07.829]  You could be a Sunni.
[01:23:08.349 --> 01:23:09.911]  I think that's pretty much all the big groups.
[01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:10.591]  Alawite.
[01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:13.013]  I mean, I guess Sunnis, 79%.
[01:23:13.733 --> 01:23:14.234]  Shiites, like 19%.
[01:23:18.223 --> 01:23:19.663]  You got another 2% that's other groups.
[01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:20.503]  I think I got that right.
[01:23:21.204 --> 01:23:29.925]  So I've studied this more than your average person, but don't know as much as somebody like Zachary Claywan, who will be joining us.
[01:23:33.786 --> 01:23:36.606]  That's coming up, but I want to hit these other stories here in just a moment.
[01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:38.207]  Some good news, though.
[01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.007]  It's also some bad news.
[01:23:41.427 --> 01:23:45.428]  You know that InfoWars was number one in the news app on
[01:23:47.071 --> 01:23:47.812]  And so they just banned it.
[01:23:48.652 --> 01:23:49.733]  You still get it on Android.
[01:23:50.173 --> 01:23:53.296]  And then if they ban that, you still got it on that phone till you upgrade it.
[01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:58.239]  That's at InfoWars.com forward slash show, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:23:59.720]  But you know that.
[01:24:01.802 --> 01:24:12.329]  But take cloud TV with a K. That obviously owns a lot of other stations, programs, and things that Trump's been promoting.
[01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:14.771]  Like One American News Network and things.
[01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:24.140]  And it is trending the fastest growing portal to TV and the internet.
[01:24:26.741 --> 01:24:42.706]  We launched a new page, as you know, a few months ago on a site that only has like 30 something million users, but it was still a lot of users because we were very, very high up with our old page we built seven years ago.
[01:24:44.178 --> 01:24:45.679]  But we're going to number one.
[01:24:45.739 --> 01:24:51.721]  Number one in trending, but number one in news with our Roku system.
[01:24:52.202 --> 01:24:56.023]  And all that was was just them putting our icon up and then linking through to our stream we send them.
[01:24:57.284 --> 01:24:58.304]  So they're selling a box.
[01:24:58.324 --> 01:24:59.725]  They're selling a subscription.
[01:24:59.785 --> 01:25:02.546]  They're making money off our content.
[01:25:02.586 --> 01:25:05.708]  But oh, the media said that's one last place he's on.
[01:25:05.748 --> 01:25:06.488]  We've got to ban that.
[01:25:07.468 --> 01:25:10.550]  Well, Cloud TV called me up and they said, you know, you're on with us.
[01:25:12.571 --> 01:25:15.034]  And they said, you're already only been with us a year.
[01:25:15.114 --> 01:25:18.258]  You're already like number two out of thousands of feeds.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.783]  Our team, the Blaze, everybody.
[01:25:23.624 --> 01:25:25.146]  Well, we're now been number one.
[01:25:26.127 --> 01:25:32.615]  And what's happening is that it's just expanding out from there.
[01:25:34.386 --> 01:25:41.608]  It's just expanding out from there where we're growing to where we're going to be, have more viewers than everybody on there, basically, at current growth rates.
[01:25:42.428 --> 01:25:46.409]  And for whatever reason, that's what happens with any TV station or radio station or system we go on.
[01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:48.770]  So that's an exciting thing.
[01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:51.791]  It's not about, oh, look, we're number one on another platform.
[01:25:55.532 --> 01:25:55.952]  It's that
[01:25:58.618 --> 01:25:59.959]  The public wants this.
[01:26:00.539 --> 01:26:04.562]  It shows the globalist propaganda and brainwashing isn't working.
[01:26:04.683 --> 01:26:05.643]  That's the good news.
[01:26:06.124 --> 01:26:08.025]  This is a real poll, or a real gauge.
[01:26:10.447 --> 01:26:11.988]  And it shows us what's really happening.
[01:26:14.029 --> 01:26:18.373]  So here's the toll-free number to join us if you are a former Muslim, current Muslim.
[01:26:19.954 --> 01:26:24.317]  You know, Islam's the only religion out there I know of that if you leave it, they can kill you.
[01:26:26.346 --> 01:26:27.787]  I mean, I want to hear from you.
[01:26:27.827 --> 01:26:28.747]  This is uncensored.
[01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:30.108]  This is unscreened.
[01:26:30.148 --> 01:26:32.529]  As long as your phone's clear and you don't cuss on air.
[01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:36.331]  Change my mind, like Steven Crowder says.
[01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:37.411]  We should start a segment on here.
[01:26:37.531 --> 01:26:40.092]  You know, they say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[01:26:40.132 --> 01:26:40.913]  I've thought about that so much.
[01:26:40.933 --> 01:26:46.335]  Let's start a segment every week for maybe two hours where we say, change my mind.
[01:26:47.516 --> 01:26:50.317]  Alex Jones, change my mind about Islam.
[01:26:52.038 --> 01:26:54.239]  Because I didn't like Dark Age Christianity, where they
[01:26:55.393 --> 01:27:02.375]  Killed women for no reason, or killed people that tried to study herbs, or, you know, were burning people at the stake for no reason, or got out of control.
[01:27:02.395 --> 01:27:04.476]  I mean, I get religions can go wrong.
[01:27:06.737 --> 01:27:08.297]  And I've read a lot of stuff in the Koran.
[01:27:08.577 --> 01:27:09.758]  I've read the Koran that makes sense.
[01:27:09.798 --> 01:27:11.138]  I've read other stuff that sounds crazy.
[01:27:12.178 --> 01:27:13.659]  But you can say, well, that's interpretation.
[01:27:14.059 --> 01:27:14.399]  Whatever.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.560]  Changed my mind about Islam.
[01:27:19.104 --> 01:27:19.524]  877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[01:27:19.544 --> 01:27:19.584]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:19.624 --> 01:27:19.784]  Change.
[01:27:19.804 --> 01:27:19.885]  My.
[01:27:20.005 --> 01:27:20.125]  Mind.
[01:27:20.145 --> 01:27:22.106]  About Islam being in this expansionist cancer.
[01:27:22.126 --> 01:27:22.566]  This is your time.
[01:27:22.586 --> 01:27:24.268]  In fact, why say first-time callers?
[01:27:24.888 --> 01:27:26.609]  You may have called before.
[01:27:26.649 --> 01:27:28.550]  If you're a Muslim, or a former Muslim,
[01:27:45.618 --> 01:27:48.900]  And you have a husband or wife that's a Muslim or a child that's converted to Islam.
[01:27:49.241 --> 01:27:51.382]  I mean, if you've got skin in the game, I want to hear from you.
[01:27:51.402 --> 01:27:51.802]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:53.504 --> 01:27:58.627]  Now, I said I had some huge news.
[01:27:58.847 --> 01:28:00.408]  We're almost out of the segment already.
[01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:04.051]  But let me just tell you what's coming up in the next segment.
[01:28:05.492 --> 01:28:06.673]  Because this is some really good news.
[01:28:06.893 --> 01:28:07.373]  Report!
[01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:11.236]  Trump to declassify FISA docs in coming weeks.
[01:28:13.578 --> 01:28:15.079]  President to launch investigation.
[01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:20.396]  So that's the first big move we've been saying you should do.
[01:28:21.037 --> 01:28:22.957]  That's the Achilles heel of the deep state.
[01:28:24.658 --> 01:28:26.579]  So, bravo to that.
[01:28:26.619 --> 01:28:27.759]  We'll tell you about that.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.041]  And then the big enchilada that's up on Infowars.com that's so important.
[01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:38.864]  Evidence shows Google's shocking deletion of Christianity.
[01:28:40.509 --> 01:28:44.111]  Tech giant celebrates Earth Day, but completely snubs Easter Sunday.
[01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:47.453]  Wait till we show you all the evidence of that.
[01:28:48.673 --> 01:28:54.517]  And then, study electric cars emit more CO2 than diesel vehicles.
[01:28:54.637 --> 01:28:55.537]  Of course they do.
[01:28:57.518 --> 01:28:58.239]  It's all a fraud.
[01:28:58.259 --> 01:28:58.759]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:07.054 --> 01:29:08.756]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:11.219]  Our most advanced formula yet.
[01:29:14.563 --> 01:29:25.096]  DNA Force Plus is focused on overhauling your body's cellular engines and supporting your optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[01:29:27.928 --> 01:29:36.453]  DNA Force Plus contains a combination of the best adaptogens on the market to help your body adapt and bend, not break.
[01:29:37.013 --> 01:29:41.436]  Hand-picked adaptogen herbs help protect your body on a cellular level.
[01:29:42.036 --> 01:29:48.240]  It's time to try the newest version of one of our most powerful formulas yet with DNA Force Plus.
[01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.881]  Available at infowarslife.com today.
[01:30:09.668 --> 01:30:13.030]  All right, let's talk to Jim in Dallas.
[01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:14.531]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:30:14.991 --> 01:30:16.672]  You work with the State National Guard.
[01:30:16.712 --> 01:30:17.913]  People think, oh, State Guard.
[01:30:18.193 --> 01:30:22.676]  That's like the creme de la creme of patriots working with federal and state, trying to defend the border.
[01:30:22.736 --> 01:30:25.257]  And Texas is the hot spot, so they're right in the middle of it.
[01:30:25.297 --> 01:30:26.478]  Jim, what are you witnessing down there?
[01:30:26.578 --> 01:30:29.799]  Well, Alex, we just had a staff meeting in Austin this morning.
[01:30:29.819 --> 01:30:38.382]  This isn't getting a lot of attention, but the Attorney General, Attorney General Paxson, and the Governor, Governor Abbott, have called up the Texas State Guard unit.
[01:30:38.422 --> 01:30:44.304]  We've been in contact with Hood and Blitt, and the Adjutant's Office there isn't talking to them, okay?
[01:30:44.364 --> 01:30:45.825]  For some unknown reason.
[01:30:45.865 --> 01:30:49.026]  Now, Major General Bowditch is the commander of all Texas forces.
[01:30:49.386 --> 01:30:53.368]  The Texas National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard, and the Texas State Guard.
[01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:56.150]  And he's activating members of the Texas State Guard.
[01:30:56.270 --> 01:31:01.332]  And, uh, the next step is the Texas National Guard, but that's got to be approved from Washington.
[01:31:01.352 --> 01:31:03.033]  Well, we don't have time for that, Alex.
[01:31:03.133 --> 01:31:13.119]  If the Border Patrol and the feds do not do something about this, the next step is Governor Abbott is going to authorize lethal force to prevent this tidal wave coming into the state of Texas.
[01:31:13.539 --> 01:31:15.321]  This is coming to a breaking point.
[01:31:15.461 --> 01:31:19.847]  If the federal government is not going to defend Texas, Texans are going to defend Texas.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.141]  And we're not waiting for the federal government to do anything.
[01:31:34.221 --> 01:31:41.603]  And I can tell you right now that the Reds, the 4th and the 8th and the 19th regiments of the Texas State Guard will be there within 72 hours.
[01:31:41.723 --> 01:31:43.484]  And we're not going with rubber bullets.
[01:31:43.544 --> 01:31:45.144]  We're being issued live rounds.
[01:31:45.384 --> 01:31:47.365]  We will not let the federal government
[01:31:47.605 --> 01:31:53.088]  We can't let Texas be invaded by a tidal wave of disease-carrying illegal aliens.
[01:31:53.328 --> 01:31:59.352]  And it's just a sad situation that the state of Texas pays 18% of all federal taxes.
[01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:04.374]  And we can't get one cavalry soldier from Hood to come down and protect the border.
[01:32:04.554 --> 01:32:13.039]  It's not the responsibility of the state of Texas under our current constitutional setup for Texas to have to appropriate $5.2 million to build a wall in our state.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:19.464]  No, I agree with you, but I'm just telling you, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:32:35.035 --> 01:32:38.759]  The beds are overwhelmed, the feds are overwhelmed, the border patrol is overwhelmed.
[01:32:39.219 --> 01:32:41.021]  The Democrats are saying just capitulate.
[01:32:41.281 --> 01:32:47.947]  If we let them break the border, literally 20% of Latin America in the next few years will spill in.
[01:32:48.567 --> 01:32:49.688]  This will be the end of the country.
[01:32:49.708 --> 01:32:51.370]  I mean, this is ending our sovereignty.
[01:32:51.730 --> 01:32:53.292]  This is the new world war right now.
[01:33:06.934 --> 01:33:09.636]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:23.086]  We haven't played this in a long time.
[01:33:25.588 --> 01:33:26.148]  Only five years.
[01:33:26.168 --> 01:33:28.230]  It's an Irish singer?
[01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.590]  How do you say it?
[01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:29.231]  Krista Berg?
[01:33:35.182 --> 01:33:36.062]  The song's called Revolution.
[01:33:36.182 --> 01:33:36.922]  It's a pretty song.
[01:33:36.942 --> 01:33:42.184]  It's like old... Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[01:33:42.244 --> 01:33:43.864]  Kind of like a folk song fused with new.
[01:33:44.184 --> 01:33:47.425]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[01:33:49.345 --> 01:33:53.967]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[01:33:54.707 --> 01:33:57.567]  And they whisper the word... Revolutions.
[01:33:59.888 --> 01:34:03.929]  There are men coming down from the valleys.
[01:34:05.632 --> 01:34:20.276]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[01:34:22.717 --> 01:34:32.160]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[01:34:34.557 --> 01:34:50.187]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[01:35:10.743 --> 01:35:12.184]  We're good to go.
[01:35:47.891 --> 01:35:54.116]  They will see you through the fire.
[01:36:30.089 --> 01:36:30.750]  Powerful stuff.
[01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.250]  All right.
[01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:32.491]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:36:32.651 --> 01:36:33.812]  I want to be specific with the listeners.
[01:36:33.872 --> 01:36:34.853]  Please listen very carefully.
[01:36:37.194 --> 01:36:40.757]  We only have open phones for Muslims to call in right now.
[01:36:43.379 --> 01:36:48.743]  Or people that have converted to Islam or people that have been born into Islam or people that have gotten out of Islam.
[01:36:49.124 --> 01:36:50.364]  That's who we're taking calls from right now.
[01:36:50.384 --> 01:36:58.831]  Because I want to give you a chance to speak out against what I've been saying and to tell me that the attacks we saw were not Islamic in Sri Lanka like CNN's saying.
[01:37:01.476 --> 01:37:05.158]  A toll-free number to join us, ladies and gentlemen, is very easy.
[01:37:11.342 --> 01:37:15.325]  And then we'll put it on screen for TV viewers as well, but the number is 877-789-2539.
[01:37:15.345 --> 01:37:15.965]  877-789-2539.
[01:37:15.985 --> 01:37:23.130]  That's specifically who we're taking calls from.
[01:37:25.212 --> 01:37:25.892]  You want to call in?
[01:37:25.912 --> 01:37:26.793]  You want to challenge me?
[01:37:26.873 --> 01:37:27.493]  It's equal time.
[01:37:28.394 --> 01:37:30.395]  We got someone coming on next hour who wants to challenge me.
[01:37:31.747 --> 01:37:32.608]  Who's a good person.
[01:37:32.869 --> 01:37:35.993]  And I think there's other perspectives to all this.
[01:37:36.013 --> 01:37:37.595]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:39.056]  Okay.
[01:37:42.801 --> 01:37:43.562]  That's next segment.
[01:37:43.582 --> 01:37:44.243]  Just a few minutes.
[01:37:44.503 --> 01:37:46.926]  We're going to get to it and go right to your calls.
[01:37:48.108 --> 01:37:50.631]  Let's get into some of the other news breaking right now.
[01:37:53.047 --> 01:37:57.628]  Evidence shows Google's shocking deletion of Christianity.
[01:37:58.488 --> 01:38:09.951]  If you're a radio listener, you owe it to yourself, your family, and anyone else who just wants to be aware of the memory hauling via 1984 of the dominant operating system that made us so successful.
[01:38:12.272 --> 01:38:19.694]  Go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com to see Jamie White's article that links to a tweet by Paul Watson.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:25.001]  Evidence shows Google's shocking deletion of Christianity.
[01:38:25.021 --> 01:38:26.261]  By the way, Apple's done this.
[01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:27.021]  They're all doing it.
[01:38:27.562 --> 01:38:36.064]  Tech giant celebrates Earth Day, but completely snubs Easter Sunday.
[01:38:36.544 --> 01:38:42.366]  And notice they then use the symbol of the sun when the sun's coming back into Easter.
[01:38:44.226 --> 01:38:47.187]  And you click on it and it's a whole video, let's do that, about the sun.
[01:38:48.177 --> 01:38:49.938]  And about the Equinox and all the rest of it.
[01:38:50.238 --> 01:38:55.501]  They'll take the most obscure leftist and make a whole big deal about it with the Google Doodle.
[01:38:56.882 --> 01:38:59.843]  But Christian holidays now are expunged and erased.
[01:39:00.204 --> 01:39:08.688]  And then the Clintons, the Obamas, all of them say, oh, we're so sorry Easter worshipers got hurt by terrorists.
[01:39:08.748 --> 01:39:09.689]  But they won't say Muslims.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.601]  Maybe we should just click on the doodle right there.
[01:39:16.621 --> 01:39:19.302]  That's a play button right there in the middle.
[01:39:19.322 --> 01:39:20.563]  Yeah, let's see the propaganda.
[01:39:21.183 --> 01:39:25.005]  Nothing to do with Christianity.
[01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:25.885]  Nothing to do with Christ.
[01:39:26.706 --> 01:39:27.566]  It's a pelican.
[01:39:29.107 --> 01:39:31.048]  The Wandering Albatross.
[01:39:34.318 --> 01:39:42.883]  So when you click on Earth Day, you learn about the Pelican, and how it's endangered, and if you don't give your rights up to the Rothschilds, or to the Clintons, or the Globalists, you're all dead.
[01:39:43.483 --> 01:39:45.965]  To AOC, the Earth is gone in 12 years.
[01:39:46.285 --> 01:39:47.385]  We're all dead in 12 years.
[01:39:47.926 --> 01:39:49.206]  Just do what they say.
[01:39:50.247 --> 01:40:00.393]  And so Paul, and it's in the article, let me put that on screen, because my eyes are okay, but they're not that good anymore to read this, has all these different holidays that Google just made up
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:06.885]  And they'll show Muslim holidays, and they'll show Buddhist holidays, and they'll show... But they don't show Christian holidays.
[01:40:07.025 --> 01:40:08.866]  No, no, no, no, no, sir.
[01:40:10.127 --> 01:40:12.169]  They'll show Japanese holidays.
[01:40:12.209 --> 01:40:13.570]  They'll show Chinese holidays.
[01:40:14.151 --> 01:40:19.115]  But they won't show a Christian holiday because Google is anti-Christian.
[01:40:19.155 --> 01:40:20.116]  Google is evil.
[01:40:22.495 --> 01:40:24.236]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[01:40:24.316 --> 01:40:35.844]  Tech giant Google celebrated the globalist created Earth Day on its homepage on Monday, but chose to ignore Easter Sunday and Christianity's holiest day when Christ rose again.
[01:40:35.864 --> 01:40:39.207]  I forget the keys to hell and death.
[01:40:40.187 --> 01:40:40.788]  What's that tell you?
[01:40:40.808 --> 01:40:45.211]  Like, what is it about Christianity that Google covers up Islamic terror?
[01:40:45.731 --> 01:40:47.853]  Google covers everything up, but not Christianity.
[01:40:48.373 --> 01:40:50.735]  It just puts it into the phantom zone.
[01:40:53.206 --> 01:41:00.689]  Rather than show a cross, even colored eggs, or even Easter Bunny, Google showed nothing on its homepage acknowledging the Easter holiday.
[01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:06.432]  But it sure made the effort to celebrate Earth Day, which promotes the idea that humans are the scourge of the planet.
[01:41:07.853 --> 01:41:16.557]  Google's decision to ignore Easter is blatant and obvious when you consider the litany of obscure and little-known holidays Google chose to celebrate, such as...
[01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:26.533]  Dunga Asina's 73rd birthday, Teacher's Day, and the 100th anniversary of Bawants.
[01:41:30.335 --> 01:41:37.578]  Paul said Google, which acknowledges Earth Day and a myriad of other obscure days, chose to acknowledge, did not choose to acknowledge Easter, precisely nothing.
[01:41:39.073 --> 01:41:39.914]  And that's what they do.
[01:41:39.934 --> 01:41:44.876]  Of course, this is part of the establishment's larger campaign to arrest Christianity from history and the cultural consciousness.
[01:41:45.257 --> 01:41:55.263]  For example, former President Obama and presidential loser Hillary Clinton referred to the hundreds of Christian victims of Sri Lankan Easter bombings as Easter worshippers, all in unison.
[01:41:56.283 --> 01:41:57.344]  Dehumanizing Christians.
[01:41:57.384 --> 01:42:07.150]  Additionally, just look at how the media covered the Sri Lanka terror attacks versus the Christchurch attack, where they downplayed Islam's role in the bombings.
[01:42:08.254 --> 01:42:10.955]  But then blamed all white people for the Moss shooting in New Zealand.
[01:42:11.936 --> 01:42:17.458]  A very important article up at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:42:17.478 --> 01:42:18.138]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:42:18.178 --> 01:42:21.079]  Come back with your calls in a minute.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.021]  And some other breaking news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:27.482]  But please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, without you, we're not here.
[01:42:28.403 --> 01:42:30.884]  And I'm selling t-shirts pretty much at cost right now.
[01:42:30.904 --> 01:42:32.344]  We have to stop the sales.
[01:42:32.364 --> 01:42:33.445]  A lot of them have almost sold out.
[01:42:34.454 --> 01:42:38.116]  But it's 50% off all apparel, ball caps, you name it.
[01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:39.496]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:41.037 --> 01:42:42.598]  Great way to trigger leptards.
[01:42:42.638 --> 01:42:43.818]  Great way to spread free speech.
[01:42:43.858 --> 01:42:46.319]  Great way to meet friends and folks you didn't know.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.080]  Got to wear your colors loud and proud.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:49.821]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:50.181 --> 01:42:51.362]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:42:51.722 --> 01:42:52.983]  Or AAA-253-3139.
[01:42:53.023 --> 01:42:56.224]  There's another big special on the side as well.
[01:42:56.744 --> 01:42:57.805]  Get a bottle of Brain Force.
[01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.766]  You get a free bottle of Knockout.
[01:43:00.226 --> 01:43:00.926]  A one-two punch.
[01:43:03.897 --> 01:43:12.826]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:21.794]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[01:43:21.975 --> 01:43:22.695]  It's ridiculous.
[01:43:22.835 --> 01:43:23.276]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[01:43:24.497 --> 01:43:27.759]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[01:43:28.019 --> 01:43:33.423]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even a synthetic is expensive.
[01:43:33.523 --> 01:43:35.664]  This is the organically derived.
[01:43:36.044 --> 01:43:36.945]  This is the real stuff.
[01:43:37.125 --> 01:43:48.633]  I want to warn you though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[01:43:48.733 --> 01:43:50.274]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[01:43:50.974 --> 01:43:51.754]  Then it poured off.
[01:43:51.995 --> 01:43:53.435]  It was numb all the way up here.
[01:43:53.575 --> 01:43:55.716]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[01:43:55.916 --> 01:43:57.477]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[01:43:57.517 --> 01:43:59.018]  First it tingled and it came back.
[01:43:59.218 --> 01:44:00.298]  I was like, this is incredible.
[01:44:00.358 --> 01:44:01.159]  But I'm going to warn you.
[01:44:01.379 --> 01:44:05.901]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[01:44:06.081 --> 01:44:09.842]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[01:44:10.042 --> 01:44:12.363]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[01:44:12.604 --> 01:44:14.384]  So it's the building blocks.
[01:44:14.665 --> 01:44:15.565]  And it's the next level.
[01:44:15.625 --> 01:44:16.545]  It's the best you're going to get.
[01:44:16.665 --> 01:44:19.447]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[01:44:19.467 --> 01:44:20.247]  We're getting into supplements.
[01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:22.329]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[01:44:22.469 --> 01:44:27.675]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[01:44:27.855 --> 01:44:32.381]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[01:44:32.721 --> 01:44:34.383]  That's a 6, 7 times markup.
[01:44:35.404 --> 01:44:36.144]  The good news is...
[01:45:05.825 --> 01:45:15.351]  After a year and a half long battle to secure the deep earth crystals that nobody else has for the purest atomic iodine out there, we have been able to secure X2.
[01:45:16.312 --> 01:45:17.813]  I was sure we weren't going to be able to get it.
[01:45:18.173 --> 01:45:20.935]  It's a derivative that the oil companies get between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:45:21.435 --> 01:45:32.543]  There's globalist industrial espionage that goes on where they try to not just take our sponsors and things, but actually stop us from getting the raw material because this is under DEA control to get the raw stuff because it's so powerful.
[01:45:33.103 --> 01:45:35.365]  So X2, after being sold out for several months,
[01:45:36.445 --> 01:45:40.648]  We were able to get it back into production from its original producer, and we now have it.
[01:45:41.028 --> 01:45:44.210]  And it is the purest, best, good halogen out there.
[01:45:44.670 --> 01:45:49.853]  Just research how IQs went down massively in the Midwest because they didn't have any iodine in the soil.
[01:45:50.253 --> 01:45:54.256]  Once the government added it, it just did all of these insanely good things.
[01:45:54.556 --> 01:45:55.076]  Research.
[01:45:55.757 --> 01:45:56.277]  It's incredible.
[01:45:56.537 --> 01:45:57.378]  One of God's great gifts.
[01:45:58.118 --> 01:45:58.979]  So X2's back.
[01:45:59.099 --> 01:46:00.120]  It's in about a week and a half.
[01:46:00.141 --> 01:46:01.642]  You can pre-order it at Infowarshore.com.
[01:46:01.662 --> 01:46:03.324]  I almost forgot.
[01:46:03.544 --> 01:46:06.548]  25% off out of the gates to celebrate the fact that it's back.
[01:46:06.588 --> 01:46:09.091]  I forgot that part.
[01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:10.252]  25% off X2.
[01:46:10.653 --> 01:46:11.654]  A lot of you have experienced it.
[01:46:11.674 --> 01:46:12.174]  You've loved it.
[01:46:12.235 --> 01:46:12.895]  A lot of you haven't.
[01:46:13.276 --> 01:46:13.776]  Try it out.
[01:46:13.816 --> 01:46:14.517]  Fund the operation.
[01:46:15.138 --> 01:46:17.160]  The bad news is, outside of our audience...
[01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:24.502]  People don't know that iodine is needed for electrochemical activity in the brain, or for your hormones, or for everything that happens in your body.
[01:46:24.883 --> 01:46:28.943]  And if you don't have it, you absorb the bad allergens like chlorine and fluoride and other things.
[01:46:29.824 --> 01:46:33.124]  So get your X2 original today and share it with people.
[01:46:33.544 --> 01:46:35.765]  Tell them about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:46:36.105 --> 01:46:38.486]  Because the bad news is a lot of people don't know.
[01:46:38.506 --> 01:46:38.526]  X2.
[01:46:41.223 --> 01:46:43.964]  It's been sold out for months, but it's coming back in right now.
[01:46:43.984 --> 01:46:46.966]  Good news for folks that are on AutoShip and InfoWareStore.com.
[01:46:47.226 --> 01:46:50.028]  Sign up for AutoShip to make sure you get every month, every two months, whatever you want.
[01:46:50.268 --> 01:46:54.670]  Cancel any time and you will get 10% off additionally on 25% off.
[01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.891]  X2's back!
[01:46:56.251 --> 01:46:59.012]  Now explain to people how critical iodine is.
[01:46:59.072 --> 01:47:00.173]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[01:47:01.373 --> 01:47:02.074]  X2's back!
[01:47:06.396 --> 01:47:09.037]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.465 --> 01:47:22.105]  You found it.
[01:47:22.805 --> 01:47:23.806]  The tip of the spear.
[01:47:24.446 --> 01:47:25.826]  The vaunted InfoWars.
[01:47:26.726 --> 01:47:27.966]  The enemy of the globalists.
[01:47:28.586 --> 01:47:32.207]  The most censored broadcast in the world.
[01:47:32.727 --> 01:47:33.828]  What a sales pitch.
[01:47:34.528 --> 01:47:37.168]  If our listeners just say, hey, you've heard Alex Jones demonize, right?
[01:47:37.208 --> 01:47:37.528]  Yeah.
[01:47:38.048 --> 01:47:39.209]  Why don't you hear what he's saying?
[01:47:40.349 --> 01:47:42.949]  They go, well, he used to be on YouTube and Facebook.
[01:47:43.009 --> 01:47:44.030]  I can't hear him anymore.
[01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:45.070]  Really?
[01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:46.550]  InfoWars.com.
[01:47:46.630 --> 01:47:47.630]  NewsWars.com.
[01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:49.291]  Hundreds of radio stations.
[01:47:49.331 --> 01:47:50.391]  Hundreds of TV stations.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:56.963]  Number one on cloud TV, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:47:57.563 --> 01:47:58.564]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:47:58.584 --> 01:48:00.264]  Okay, we've got some Muslims have called in.
[01:48:00.885 --> 01:48:06.528]  I appreciate Hattie and Mo and Alex and Ian and Ammar calling in.
[01:48:06.548 --> 01:48:17.614]  We're going to go just right down the line here from Hattie, who's calling in from Detroit and then Mo in Texas and Alex in California and Ian in Arizona and Ammar in Georgia.
[01:48:18.919 --> 01:48:26.063]  Lamar's from Bosnia, and Ian's a convert, Muslim convert.
[01:48:26.083 --> 01:48:30.165]  Then you've got Alex from Armenia.
[01:48:31.846 --> 01:48:32.946]  You've got Moe in Texas.
[01:48:33.186 --> 01:48:37.509]  All these areas, he was formerly from Lebanon, all these places were formerly Christian.
[01:48:37.889 --> 01:48:39.309]  Just thought I might point that out.
[01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:42.931]  Converted via conquest, but maybe I'm wrong.
[01:48:43.572 --> 01:48:44.752]  Maybe they can teach me I'm wrong.
[01:48:45.012 --> 01:48:47.854]  Hattie in Detroit, I appreciate you calling in, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:48.976 --> 01:48:50.096]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:48:50.636 --> 01:48:51.117]  I'm doing good.
[01:48:51.137 --> 01:48:52.077]  I appreciate you calling in.
[01:48:52.097 --> 01:48:54.037]  Man, pleasure man.
[01:48:54.057 --> 01:48:55.458]  Pleasure to be on the line with you.
[01:48:55.478 --> 01:48:58.218]  I'm going to be a huge fan, huge fan.
[01:48:59.819 --> 01:49:01.799]  Maybe, I really don't know where to start.
[01:49:02.319 --> 01:49:03.780]  Maybe you ask me a few questions.
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:06.060]  No, just you've heard what I'm talking about.
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.721]  You've seen what's happening in the world, the clash of civilizations.
[01:49:09.401 --> 01:49:17.183]  So I don't support going into Muslim countries and killing people, but I also don't support Muslims moving into the United States or Europe and making us adopt their stuff.
[01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:19.505]  Absolutely.
[01:49:19.525 --> 01:49:22.347]  I mean, there's a lot of different types of Muslims.
[01:49:22.407 --> 01:49:25.268]  Like you brought up Sunni and Shiite yesterday on Live.
[01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:28.730]  Not every Arab is born Muslim.
[01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:30.330]  I'm from a country called Lebanon.
[01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:33.032]  I don't know if you've ever heard of Lebanon.
[01:49:33.072 --> 01:49:34.652]  Lebanon's just north of Israel.
[01:49:34.873 --> 01:49:35.793]  I know all about Lebanon.
[01:49:36.874 --> 01:49:37.154]  Yeah.
[01:49:37.174 --> 01:49:38.274]  It's a beautiful country.
[01:49:38.294 --> 01:49:41.656]  Muslims and Catholics, Christians, they live together in harmony.
[01:49:41.796 --> 01:49:43.437]  It's just a perfect country.
[01:49:44.237 --> 01:49:45.237]  No violence.
[01:49:47.779 --> 01:49:48.319]  I really don't...
[01:49:49.295 --> 01:49:50.056]  We're good to go.
[01:50:00.216 --> 01:50:15.126]  Well, just, what do you make of maps we can put on screen of since Muhammad, 1400 years ago, massive expansion of Islam, and then almost all Muslim countries, you mentioned Lebanon, that's one of the few where Christians aren't persecuted that much.
[01:50:15.847 --> 01:50:17.408]  Syria was like that until recently.
[01:50:18.008 --> 01:50:21.831]  And just, I mean, what do you make for most Muslim countries being 99% Muslim?
[01:50:24.213 --> 01:50:25.874]  I mean, that's just, that's just what they want.
[01:50:26.574 --> 01:50:28.816]  Like, you mentioned it before, I don't,
[01:50:35.846 --> 01:50:45.679]  Well, you know, Lebanon used to be majority Christian, and then the Christians live side by side with Muslims, but you know there's been an exponential increase in attacks on Christians in Lebanon now.
[01:50:49.747 --> 01:50:52.388]  I'm sure if that did actually happen it was most likely an outsider.
[01:50:52.728 --> 01:50:54.088]  I know Lebanese people, you never hear of a
[01:51:14.342 --> 01:51:16.263]  Not only Lebanians, just Shiites.
[01:51:16.423 --> 01:51:17.503]  They really don't do that.
[01:51:34.935 --> 01:51:36.316]  I mean, they really just brainwash.
[01:51:36.336 --> 01:51:38.517]  You see what the radical Muslims do.
[01:51:38.577 --> 01:51:42.559]  They target famous rich people, young guys from London.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:43.480]  They bring them in.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:44.561]  They just brainwash them.
[01:51:44.581 --> 01:51:46.642]  They tell them this is a religion when it's just a lie.
[01:51:46.662 --> 01:51:49.263]  It's just not how it goes down.
[01:51:49.303 --> 01:51:50.224]  Well, what you're saying is true.
[01:51:50.264 --> 01:52:03.652]  The CIA, the Lepus Foundation have been going out for 50 years and handing out millions of textbooks to Arabic children, teaching them four plus four, you know, four hand grenades plus four machine guns equals kill the infidel.
[01:52:04.272 --> 01:52:08.915]  So, why do you think the West, if you agree with me, has been actually trying to radicalize Islam?
[01:52:11.437 --> 01:52:15.079]  The West hasn't... hasn't here in America?
[01:52:15.099 --> 01:52:18.581]  I mean, certain globalist groups have been trying to radicalize Islam.
[01:52:22.604 --> 01:52:29.148]  You know, man, they just... they probably just think that they want... they just need one religion in the world, and that's just not going to happen.
[01:52:29.537 --> 01:52:34.919]  Well, that's the Albert Pike plan is actually get Christians and Muslims to kill each other and then bring in the Lucifer religion.
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.240]  I think you're on target there.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:37.741]  I think you're on target.
[01:52:37.761 --> 01:52:43.664]  I think I overcompensate because the media defends radical Islam so much and covers up for it that it makes me attack anybody that's a Muslim.
[01:52:44.504 --> 01:52:47.105]  And I'm just going with my gut here.
[01:52:47.685 --> 01:52:52.227]  But I do see a larger hidden hand manipulating it.
[01:52:52.728 --> 01:52:54.108]  Thank you, Hattie.
[01:52:54.388 --> 01:52:55.249]  Who's up next here?
[01:52:57.403 --> 01:52:57.603]  Hello.
[01:52:57.643 --> 01:52:57.963]  Hello.
[01:52:58.003 --> 01:53:01.905]  First of all, I just want to thank you for having me on here.
[01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:29.620]  Yes, and I just, you know, and it's crazy because for a very long time I've been listening to you, and when it comes to politics, the left, and all the New World Order stuff, I've read some of your work, I agree with you.
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:41.943]  But when it comes to, I guess, it's mainly from your other co-hosts like Joseph Paul Watson, where they kind of, they have slandered and demonized my religion into
[01:53:43.203 --> 01:53:44.143]  It's simply as a quote.
[01:53:44.603 --> 01:54:07.269]  But as I've been on articles commenting many people, you know, beyond the comments and kind of like, it's not challenging, but it's having a dialogue, just trying to show that, hey, I practice my religion, I read the Quran, the Sunnis, I read all that stuff for so long, and I see nothing evil.
[01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:08.949]  So it just dawned upon me.
[01:54:11.325 --> 01:54:12.506]  Well that's the paradox.
[01:54:13.207 --> 01:54:20.173]  Why do you think, I mean Obama did fund the Arab Spring to put ISIS and Al-Qaeda in charge of all these countries that were not against the U.S.
[01:54:20.533 --> 01:54:21.434]  and let people live in peace.
[01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:29.842]  I mean I see the left trying to fund radical, hardcore, aggressive Islam that's just going to cause a world war and everybody killing each other.
[01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:35.948]  I mean maybe you disagree with that, but I mean do you have any comments on the left's alliance with expansionist Islam?
[01:54:37.042 --> 01:54:37.282]  Yes.
[01:54:38.643 --> 01:54:43.986]  My take on it is, I would say it all started from 1948 when they founded Israel.
[01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:51.511]  The whole point, because when you look at, even before then, the Middle East wasn't that, it wasn't as dismantled as it is now.
[01:54:51.871 --> 01:54:57.435]  But as soon as you added Israel, and I have nothing against Jews, I love Jews, I know a lot of Jewish friends.
[01:54:57.795 --> 01:55:00.377]  When you add, when you add that Zionist faith
[01:55:00.957 --> 01:55:13.610]  And their whole goal is to control and consume all of the Lebanon area, which is Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, then that's kind of how it started.
[01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:20.716]  I guess in my perspective, it's like this whole entire Judeo-Christian type alliance of
[01:55:22.658 --> 01:55:26.899]  Well, Erron, you've said something very true here, and I'm not against Israel itself, but what you said is true.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:37.324]  People are asking me, because it came out in Rothschild documents, it came out in Wikileaks, that Soros wants to basically break Israel up, but have a huge war that then consumes the Middle East.
[01:55:39.693 --> 01:55:41.895]  He emailed me and they called me and I saw it in the news.
[01:55:42.416 --> 01:55:47.761]  Well wait, Jones is saying that the Rothschilds are against Netanyahu.
[01:55:47.821 --> 01:55:49.683]  They publicly tried to finance against him.
[01:55:49.984 --> 01:55:53.968]  They owned The Economist magazine saying that Bibi's the devil.
[01:55:54.148 --> 01:55:57.391]  Whether you like Netanyahu or hate him, there's different factions in Israel.
[01:55:58.132 --> 01:56:00.293]  And the point is, he just wants Israel to be there and successful.
[01:56:00.773 --> 01:56:03.414]  The Rothschilds have a plan to destabilize the Middle East.
[01:56:03.814 --> 01:56:09.396]  They believe bringing world government out of the crisis and make a world government forum around that.
[01:56:09.416 --> 01:56:11.377]  And it gets very biblical and very occultic.
[01:56:12.117 --> 01:56:19.260]  But it's actually true that their plan is to use Israel to destabilize and trigger a world war.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.381]  It gets into Albert Pike and all the rest of it.
[01:56:21.421 --> 01:56:22.041]  It's crazy.
[01:56:23.408 --> 01:56:23.648]  Mm-hmm.
[01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:30.254]  And just to like, and just kind of elevate further, it kind of goes back to what happened after 9-11.
[01:56:30.774 --> 01:56:38.160]  When, as soon as 9-11 happened, we went straight into the invasion of Iraq and we, you know, we already knew what happened before Iraq.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.264]  And then that was used to destabilize the Middle East and then bring in the Arab Spring and the collapse of the European borders.
[01:56:44.494 --> 01:56:56.244]  And then what happens is you have a generation of Iraqi and Syrian youths who don't, who, they see America as the enemy because you simply have, because you see America as a threat.
[01:56:56.344 --> 01:56:56.724]  No, I get it.
[01:56:56.744 --> 01:56:57.365]  PNAC says it.
[01:56:57.485 --> 01:56:58.826]  Clash of civilizations.
[01:56:59.407 --> 01:57:04.351]  Go in, attack the Muslims, kill a bunch of them, and then get them to attack us.
[01:57:05.111 --> 01:57:05.652]  I agree with you.
[01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:06.813]  So what do we do about that?
[01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:24.556]  Honestly, my thing is we need to separate this barbaric, occultic, psychopathic form of Islam, which these people who use my religion as a political agenda, we need to separate that.
[01:57:25.416 --> 01:57:26.256]  It's really hard.
[01:57:59.281 --> 01:58:01.402]  And let's go to Lukas in North Carolina.
[01:58:01.422 --> 01:58:02.623]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:58:02.643 --> 01:58:03.703]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:58:03.723 --> 01:58:04.343]  Good to be on.
[01:58:04.363 --> 01:58:05.104]  Good to have you here.
[01:58:05.344 --> 01:58:09.546]  Real quickly, I just wanted to say that I am a user of the Infowars products.
[01:58:09.786 --> 01:58:12.087]  First, I started with Supermail Vitality.
[01:58:12.107 --> 01:58:19.730]  I am a late 30s male, and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as much as I do, and immediately noticed that
[01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:25.512]  Being able to retain strength and muscle mass from the use of super male vitality, so I want to thank you for that.
[01:58:25.652 --> 01:58:31.695]  Also, I bought the t-shirt, Reelect 45, and the Hillary for Prison, obviously, one of the most popular.
[01:58:31.715 --> 01:58:36.797]  It's drawn so much attention, and I don't know if people believe it or not, but it's all positive attention.
[01:58:36.877 --> 01:58:43.239]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old, and middle-aged black women.
[01:58:43.399 --> 01:58:46.840]  Honestly, God, they were the ones commenting, saying, I love that shirt.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:49.381]  They would laugh about it, tell their friends about it.
[01:58:49.541 --> 01:59:01.184]  And, uh, next I tried X2 and, uh, it's nothing that you notice immediately, but it seemed over time, I felt like I was more sharp from the iodine, being able to retain short-term memory better.
[01:59:01.224 --> 01:59:04.345]  I just feel a little sharper in my day-to-day activities.
[01:59:04.605 --> 01:59:06.226]  I totally, I totally agree with you.
[01:59:06.527 --> 01:59:08.128]  Again, it's the good halogen.
[01:59:08.308 --> 01:59:11.310]  IQs get reduced by 15 points without iodine.
[01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:13.452]  In your development, people can look this up for themselves.
[01:59:13.912 --> 01:59:18.215]  And that's why the globalists are obsessed with making sure it's not in the food, it's not in the products we eat.
[01:59:18.616 --> 01:59:20.177]  We are just starving for iodine.
[01:59:20.217 --> 01:59:21.238]  That's why we came out with X2.
[01:59:21.278 --> 01:59:24.580]  We have X3 that's all three types, but this is the deep-earth crystal source.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:25.901]  We don't have it back in stock.
[01:59:25.981 --> 01:59:28.103]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:28.263 --> 01:59:30.505]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub-page.
[01:59:30.525 --> 01:59:32.346]  That has all the award-winning supplements.
[01:59:32.466 --> 01:59:36.169]  And while you're there getting the supplements, go check out the hundreds of great t-shirts.
[01:59:36.249 --> 01:59:37.890]  Many of them are limited edition.
[01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.591]  It's all there.
[01:59:38.751 --> 01:59:43.115]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:54.784 --> 02:00:00.689]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.867 --> 02:00:19.375]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:50.505 --> 02:00:52.125]  All right, Iram is a Muslim.
[02:00:52.165 --> 02:00:53.386]  He's calling in from Texas.
[02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:57.768]  And he's saying these terror attacks are not his religion.
[02:00:59.449 --> 02:01:02.010]  He can argue, look, the Islamic country is being invaded.
[02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:04.851]  I see all that, and I've been against that offensively.
[02:01:04.891 --> 02:01:05.632]  People shouldn't do that.
[02:01:06.601 --> 02:01:12.943]  And we'll talk about the CIA and other groups that have famously been caught funding radical Islam.
[02:01:12.983 --> 02:01:21.945]  So what's the larger plan for this clash of civilizations that Dick Cheney wrote about in the PNAC documents back in 2000?
[02:01:23.685 --> 02:01:25.706]  Continuing, Irram with other points.
[02:01:25.726 --> 02:01:26.046]  Go ahead.
[02:01:28.086 --> 02:01:28.306]  Yes.
[02:01:31.249 --> 02:01:33.952]  One time I was saying that, I was thinking, like, what's the ultimate goal?
[02:01:34.352 --> 02:01:52.150]  And I feel like, well, you think about it, there's this less, there's a satanic, the satanic Lutheran, um, no, not, not, um, Luciferian, um, type of, um, like, Illuminati kind of artists, all these little, these little secret societies, their whole goal is to
[02:01:53.411 --> 02:02:01.413]  Like, it's to, um, corrupt almost all these religions, yes, to intertwine each other and to make them the worst that they ever is.
[02:02:02.153 --> 02:02:09.335]  And as you noticed, with Christchurch, they even tell you where Charlie Manson tried to kill people and blame it on black people to cause a race war.
[02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:09.455]  Yeah.
[02:02:09.475 --> 02:02:11.375]  And it's the same thing with this guy at Christchurch.
[02:02:11.415 --> 02:02:13.776]  He said he wants a clash of civilizations.
[02:02:15.076 --> 02:02:15.416]  Mm-hmm.
[02:02:16.917 --> 02:02:18.597]  So what do you think comes out of that, though?
[02:02:22.279 --> 02:02:25.143]  I see, you know, what happened in Christchurch was a
[02:02:28.456 --> 02:02:31.838]  It was a horrific shock.
[02:02:32.379 --> 02:02:41.285]  And the whole Muslim world, whether they were hypocrites or transgressors, they are Muslims, but of course they're not.
[02:02:41.365 --> 02:02:43.706]  And though they're true Muslims, they feel sadness.
[02:02:44.167 --> 02:02:51.511]  But then when you look at what happened in Sri Lanka, what happened to the Notre Dame Cathedral, I personally was sad about that.
[02:02:51.732 --> 02:02:57.996]  When these killings happened, I stand with my Christian brothers and my sisters, because they would do the same thing for me.
[02:02:58.576 --> 02:02:58.996]  Hopefully.
[02:02:59.116 --> 02:03:03.939]  And that's the whole point that it needs to happen.
[02:03:04.399 --> 02:03:10.862]  Because you got too many elitists, too many higher powers trying to... Well, we know this.
[02:03:11.322 --> 02:03:11.882]  We know this.
[02:03:12.123 --> 02:03:17.605]  Why do you think Google and Apple are banning Christianity and just removing it from the history books?
[02:03:17.645 --> 02:03:22.508]  Because there is an anti-Christian bent in the left, and that's why they're supporting radical Islam.
[02:03:22.528 --> 02:03:25.269]  It's because they want it to go after Christianity.
[02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:34.653]  I guess I'll say that's the same thing as they want Christians to go after Muslims.
[02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:45.583]  Sure, so it's like from Russia With Love where there's the three Chinese fighting fish and the smart one waits till the others almost kill each other and then he goes in and takes them out?
[02:03:46.144 --> 02:03:52.390]  I mean that really is, there is definitely an evil black hand or an unseen hand
[02:03:53.351 --> 02:03:56.553]  Definitely manipulating this clash of civilizations.
[02:03:56.593 --> 02:04:06.238]  I mean, have you read what Albert Pike wrote about how they're going to cause a world war between Muslims and Christians, and then out of that the true religion, Luciferianism, is supposedly going to take over?
[02:04:07.659 --> 02:04:16.424]  I haven't read his actual work, but I've read many biographies of him and can know, yes, that's his agenda.
[02:04:17.184 --> 02:04:18.725]  You know, he was the founder of the KKK.
[02:04:19.726 --> 02:04:19.866]  Yes.
[02:04:20.964 --> 02:04:22.265]  There's a lot of weirdness going on there.
[02:04:22.325 --> 02:04:23.485]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:04:24.766 --> 02:04:25.927]  Irram, interesting points.
[02:04:25.987 --> 02:04:28.348]  And I just want to give people a fair shake here, because here's the deal.
[02:04:28.388 --> 02:04:29.429]  I don't want to kill Muslims.
[02:04:30.049 --> 02:04:31.510]  I don't want to go over there and wipe people out.
[02:04:32.130 --> 02:04:39.254]  But when George Soros is funding Open Borders and bringing people in, and then they're saying, well, this guy's a Muslim, so he's allowed to rape a 10-year-old girl.
[02:04:39.815 --> 02:04:45.478]  It's the left's cucking infatuation with the worst people that are in Islam.
[02:04:45.838 --> 02:04:47.399]  But there are people that say they're Christian that are bad.
[02:04:47.799 --> 02:04:47.919]  Wars.
[02:04:47.939 --> 02:04:49.100]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.401]  We've got four or five positions.
[02:05:12.045 --> 02:05:12.825]  We're good to go.
[02:05:29.295 --> 02:05:33.896]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill and a lot of new secret projects going on.
[02:05:34.137 --> 02:05:42.519]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[02:05:42.559 --> 02:05:46.280]  Send your resumes to techjobs at InfoWars.com today.
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:53.362]  I look forward to meeting some of you and shaking your hand and having you jump on the Millennium Falcon at the start of Episode 4, because that's what you're going to be doing.
[02:05:53.402 --> 02:05:55.143]  This is the real ticket to adventure.

[02:05:58.965 --> 02:06:01.387]  Tech jobs at Infowars.com.
[02:06:01.507 --> 02:06:03.949]  Tech jobs at Infowars.com.
[02:06:15.556 --> 02:06:21.801]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.631 --> 02:06:27.475]  Alright, Zachary Claywan is going to ride shotgun with us the rest of the hour.
[02:06:27.495 --> 02:06:38.790]  We're going to take calls exclusively from Muslims about what they think about the Sri Lankan attacks and what they think about the class of civilizations and where they think this is all going.
[02:06:39.633 --> 02:06:42.974]  And we're gonna go in the order of people that have been holding the longest, once we get our guest on.
[02:06:43.474 --> 02:06:45.655]  With Mo in Texas, is a Muslim from Lebanon.
[02:06:46.656 --> 02:06:50.297]  We've got Alex in California, from Armenia, grew up in the Mideast.
[02:06:51.017 --> 02:06:55.639]  We've got Ian in Arizona, Muslim convert, currently Christian, on Islamic terror.
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:58.100]  Muslim convert, currently Christian.
[02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:00.201]  This means, go back and forth.
[02:07:01.642 --> 02:07:04.003]  Add to Juan in Illinois, former Muslim, terror topic.
[02:07:04.543 --> 02:07:07.204]  Amar from Bosnia, family's Muslim, on topic.
[02:07:08.112 --> 02:07:09.713]  Abdul in the UK.
[02:07:09.773 --> 02:07:10.734]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[02:07:11.555 --> 02:07:13.116]  In fact, I'm going to go to Mo and then Abdul.
[02:07:13.476 --> 02:07:14.036]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:07:14.357 --> 02:07:17.859]  The riding shotgun is Zachary Clayone, think tank engineer.
[02:07:17.879 --> 02:07:19.761]  Been in the Army.
[02:07:19.781 --> 02:07:21.842]  There's a lot of good sources.
[02:07:21.862 --> 02:07:23.243]  I know some of the sources myself.
[02:07:23.303 --> 02:07:24.284]  They tell me he's a good guy.
[02:07:24.304 --> 02:07:28.747]  And, you know, he was at Fort Hood when that whole PSYOP went down.
[02:07:29.588 --> 02:07:31.409]  And, of course, he would call himself a former Muslim.
[02:07:31.449 --> 02:07:32.530]  Now he's just a human.
[02:07:33.331 --> 02:07:34.812]  But I think, you know, he's
[02:07:36.844 --> 02:07:42.115]  He doesn't like watching Muslims only getting a one-way street.
[02:07:42.877 --> 02:07:44.200]  And so he can say it in his own words.
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:45.322]  Are you a former Muslim?
[02:07:45.362 --> 02:07:46.004]  Current Muslim?
[02:07:46.805 --> 02:07:47.907]  Zach, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:07:49.262 --> 02:07:51.583]  Alex, it's so great to be on with you.
[02:07:51.623 --> 02:08:04.766]  And first and foremost, I'd just like to say bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim to all the individuals who are holding on the line and As-salamu alaykum, which just means peace be upon you to every Christian, Jew, Buddhist and human being on this planet.
[02:08:05.126 --> 02:08:07.687]  I have several points to make, but it centers around this.
[02:08:08.487 --> 02:08:12.389]  This is a class of civilizations in order to pin us against each other.
[02:08:12.989 --> 02:08:17.050]  So we beat each other up and the AI takeover takes over.
[02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.650]  Okay.
[02:08:18.573 --> 02:08:22.415]  Humans beat each other up, and technology continues to progress.
[02:08:22.835 --> 02:08:24.255]  I have many points to make.
[02:08:24.655 --> 02:08:28.777]  I could tell you everything, the history, I have the timeline, but this is not a debate.
[02:08:28.797 --> 02:08:30.458]  Well, I'm sure folks want to hold some.
[02:08:30.578 --> 02:08:31.198]  They'll be fine.
[02:08:31.218 --> 02:08:32.078]  If people got to go, they got to go.
[02:08:32.098 --> 02:08:36.340]  We're going to get to everybody, at least the seven or eight callers that are online, but you've got seven minutes to break.
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:38.801]  Give us just a stalt, a breakdown of what you're saying.
[02:08:39.221 --> 02:08:41.722]  Hey, well, you know, I have a litany of things here.
[02:08:41.762 --> 02:08:42.542]  I have a timeline.
[02:08:42.842 --> 02:08:45.784]  But I'm just going to start by this, and I'm just going to go ahead and say it.
[02:08:46.144 --> 02:08:47.284]  I'm going to say these things.
[02:08:47.344 --> 02:08:48.104]  I may be in trouble.
[02:08:48.185 --> 02:08:48.745]  I may not.
[02:08:48.785 --> 02:08:49.585]  I'm an American citizen.
[02:08:49.605 --> 02:08:49.945]  You say it!
[02:08:50.065 --> 02:08:50.245]  Go!
[02:08:50.766 --> 02:08:50.886]  Go!
[02:08:50.906 --> 02:08:51.486]  Okay, first.
[02:08:51.626 --> 02:08:55.747]  First and foremost, the first contact with Osama bin Laden was in 1979.
[02:08:57.668 --> 02:09:01.849]  When he was a new graduate from the University of Jeddah, he got in touch with the U.S.
[02:09:01.969 --> 02:09:03.569]  Embassy in Ankara, Turkey.
[02:09:03.989 --> 02:09:05.990]  With the help of the CIA and the U.S.
[02:09:06.130 --> 02:09:16.372]  Armed Forces Intelligence Services, he began to organize in the early 1980s and network to raise money to recruit fighters for the Afghan Mujahideens when they were fighting the then Soviets.
[02:09:16.892 --> 02:09:20.433]  He did that from a city in Peshawar in Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan.
[02:09:21.013 --> 02:09:26.134]  Parts of these activities were financed with production and sales of morphine, the base of heroin.
[02:09:26.678 --> 02:09:30.607]  This was the beginning of today's Al Qaeda, the base network led by Bin Laden.
[02:09:31.148 --> 02:09:35.017]  Indeed, the chickens are coming home to roost for the CIA and the U.S.
[02:09:35.077 --> 02:09:35.538]  bosses.
[02:09:36.374 --> 02:09:40.135]  So let's just go back to the Mujahideen where this all started.
[02:09:40.475 --> 02:09:44.256]  I understand what's going on with radical Islam, but let's not play this game.
[02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.096]  We have selective amnesia.
[02:09:46.297 --> 02:09:47.417]  Did we forget about 9-11?
[02:09:48.077 --> 02:09:49.297]  Where are the WMDs?
[02:09:49.417 --> 02:09:50.698]  Did we forget about Libya?
[02:09:51.178 --> 02:09:51.718]  Where is that?
[02:09:52.158 --> 02:09:54.839]  What about the creation of ISIS out of Libya?
[02:09:55.159 --> 02:10:00.480]  How about the $2 billion worth of cash on pallets on a C-130 going to Iran?
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.681]  There are several sects of Islam.
[02:10:03.101 --> 02:10:03.861]  Several sects.
[02:10:04.622 --> 02:10:05.723]  Don't put a blanket on it.
[02:10:05.923 --> 02:10:06.744]  There's different types.
[02:10:06.804 --> 02:10:08.186]  There's Islamic Fundamentalists.
[02:10:08.246 --> 02:10:09.006]  There's Puritans.
[02:10:09.046 --> 02:10:09.847]  There's Traditionals.
[02:10:10.007 --> 02:10:10.728]  There's Modernists.
[02:10:10.768 --> 02:10:11.489]  There's Secularists.
[02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:13.571]  There's African American Nation of Islamists.
[02:10:13.791 --> 02:10:15.152]  There's Mystic Sufi Muslims.
[02:10:15.172 --> 02:10:15.933]  There's Refugees.
[02:10:16.153 --> 02:10:17.695]  There's Folk and Popular Muslims.
[02:10:18.531 --> 02:10:22.575]  You know, I don't blame Baptists and Lutherans for what the Catholic Church is doing.
[02:10:22.815 --> 02:10:28.540]  This is a class of civilizations, and the only people who are profiting from this are the architects.
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:29.921]  They want us to do this.
[02:10:30.302 --> 02:10:35.126]  We're beating each other up, we're degrading each other, and the AI system's taking over.
[02:10:35.326 --> 02:10:36.267]  People need to wake up.
[02:10:36.647 --> 02:10:39.610]  Muslim, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, I don't give a damn.
[02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:40.971]  Our blood types are the same.
[02:10:41.011 --> 02:10:41.932]  We are human beings.
[02:10:42.252 --> 02:10:45.295]  And we could get into the CIA operations because it's very relevant.
[02:10:45.555 --> 02:10:47.157]  They're in Afghanistan.
[02:10:47.718 --> 02:10:49.220]  Where's heroin made?
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.141]  Afghanistan.
[02:10:50.161 --> 02:10:51.263]  What do we have in this country?
[02:10:51.483 --> 02:10:55.809]  I don't care if you're white, black, in the back hills of West Virginia, there's an opioid epidemic.
[02:10:55.849 --> 02:10:57.631]  No, that's why Trump's trying to get out of Afghanistan.
[02:10:57.651 --> 02:10:58.272]  You're absolutely right.
[02:10:58.913 --> 02:10:59.694]  This is deep.
[02:11:00.347 --> 02:11:01.027]  This is deep.
[02:11:01.267 --> 02:11:03.909]  We're all in the same stadium, looking at the same game.
[02:11:03.949 --> 02:11:04.829]  You might be looking at it.
[02:11:04.849 --> 02:11:06.110]  We're looking at the same God.
[02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:09.311]  If we want to play politics, if we want to play checkers, that's fine.
[02:11:09.691 --> 02:11:12.212]  These guys who I'm talking to are playing chess.
[02:11:12.552 --> 02:11:13.473]  So we can get into it.
[02:11:14.013 --> 02:11:15.434]  I got a lot to get into.
[02:11:15.454 --> 02:11:18.335]  I'm going to start rolling into it, because that's what I want to get you on.
[02:11:18.975 --> 02:11:20.297]  Well, I think it's hilarious.
[02:11:20.637 --> 02:11:22.399]  And I got a message for Huma Abdeen.
[02:11:22.459 --> 02:11:23.180]  Huma, how you doing?
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:24.221]  Someone get this clip to her.
[02:11:24.522 --> 02:11:26.364]  I found some information you lost there, honey.
[02:11:26.944 --> 02:11:29.147]  You know, you could have got it in Marrakesh.
[02:11:29.167 --> 02:11:29.767]  You didn't get it.
[02:11:29.807 --> 02:11:31.830]  But, you know, I think I have another place we could meet up.
[02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:33.912]  Maybe somewhere in Cuba, like Guantanamo.
[02:11:34.292 --> 02:11:35.554]  Let me just keep going.
[02:11:36.408 --> 02:11:42.132]  The tweets from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton may be the most despicable thing I've ever seen in my life.
[02:11:42.612 --> 02:11:54.780]  You two snakes in the grass created that mess in Libya, created ISIS, destabilized continually Syria and what was going on, and I was at the Fort Hood shooting.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:56.141]  My name's Zachary Lee Klawan.
[02:11:56.161 --> 02:11:56.841]  You know who I am.
[02:11:56.881 --> 02:11:57.982]  How's it going, Hussein?
[02:11:58.362 --> 02:11:59.203]  I know what happened.
[02:11:59.443 --> 02:12:07.209]  You marched us down old Ironside Road, you marched us back behind 3 Corps, and you stood up and you saluted those boots of those people who you gunned down.
[02:12:07.690 --> 02:12:08.591]  You're a snake.
[02:12:08.951 --> 02:12:09.631]  I don't care.
[02:12:09.651 --> 02:12:10.973]  I don't care what they do.
[02:12:11.273 --> 02:12:12.654]  I'm not going to see my family.
[02:12:13.034 --> 02:12:14.215]  Muslims are people.
[02:12:14.475 --> 02:12:15.756]  Muslims are in this country.
[02:12:15.796 --> 02:12:23.523]  Muslims are doctors, police officers, paramedics, teachers, neighbors, widows, mothers, and me.
[02:12:24.844 --> 02:12:25.805]  We're human beings.
[02:12:26.185 --> 02:12:27.246]  This is low-level stuff.
[02:12:28.612 --> 02:12:29.653]  We're going to the moon.
[02:12:29.913 --> 02:12:33.135]  We're going multi-planetary, and they want us to kill each other.
[02:12:33.456 --> 02:12:37.859]  This is CIA architecture, and that piece I saw by Gregg Reese pissed me off.
[02:12:38.099 --> 02:12:39.139]  I know he's a good guy.
[02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:44.243]  I'm not mad at him, but showing planes hitting buildings, showing ISIS fighters,
[02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:46.644]  And showing the KKK, give me a break.
[02:12:47.065 --> 02:12:48.225]  Who's underneath those hoods?
[02:12:48.726 --> 02:12:55.610]  Listen, if I want to go and nitpick out of the Quran, we could go into the Bible and go into Exodus 21, 7-8.
[02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:56.890]  We could start nitpicking.
[02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:58.211]  What are we doing to each other?
[02:12:59.332 --> 02:13:00.272]  Everything is barbaric.
[02:13:00.292 --> 02:13:03.574]  Greg's a good guy, we're all giving different perspectives here.
[02:13:03.754 --> 02:13:04.595]  This ain't right, man.
[02:13:04.775 --> 02:13:06.436]  This is like, we gotta stick together.
[02:13:07.898 --> 02:13:10.099]  Well it's good because it got you mad, now you're being articulate.
[02:13:10.119 --> 02:13:11.839]  You're a smart guy, the guy I talk to on the phone sometimes.
[02:13:12.199 --> 02:13:22.221]  So continue to make your points, we'll come back and take more calls, but I agree with you that there's a globalist force trying to put the most radical, out-of-control Muslims in charge, trying to create a class of civilizations.
[02:13:22.581 --> 02:13:23.642]  What's the endgame of that?
[02:13:23.742 --> 02:13:28.043]  I agree, we're all killing each other while the globalists have a breakaway civilization.
[02:13:29.103 --> 02:13:29.563]  Important.
[02:13:29.963 --> 02:13:33.364]  People speak about Saudi Arabia and Iran in the same sentence as Muslims.
[02:13:33.464 --> 02:13:34.404]  Are you out of your mind?
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:37.161]  One is Shia, and one is Shiite.
[02:13:37.662 --> 02:13:38.582]  They hate each other.
[02:13:39.103 --> 02:13:40.143]  They're not the same thing.
[02:13:40.864 --> 02:13:44.006]  Obama, on a C-130, without the U.S.
[02:13:44.046 --> 02:13:47.408]  Treasury knowing about it, flew two billion dollars into Iran.
[02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:55.914]  Trump stopped the deal, and now we have King bin Salam in the White House, who's from Saudi Arabia, buying Boeing and Raytheon products.
[02:13:56.254 --> 02:13:59.396]  They're different things, and you guys are using an umbrella statement.
[02:13:59.637 --> 02:14:00.537]  It's a problem.
[02:14:00.757 --> 02:14:03.219]  No, no, I know that there's different
[02:14:03.739 --> 02:14:13.510]  Well, my whole point is I look at a map from the founding of Islam, and I see it taking the world over, and then I see once the countries are Islamic, they're almost 100% Islamic, and I don't see that under other systems.
[02:14:13.550 --> 02:14:19.096]  I mean, an earlier caller goes, well, people just choose to be under Islam once it becomes a majority.
[02:14:19.376 --> 02:14:20.778]  Well, yeah, because they get killed.
[02:14:22.965 --> 02:14:25.386]  But this is preposterous.
[02:14:25.466 --> 02:14:25.826]  It's 2019.
[02:14:25.886 --> 02:14:26.667]  Things are changing.
[02:14:28.287 --> 02:14:29.888]  Listen, we can't nitpick.
[02:14:29.908 --> 02:14:32.729]  Do you want me to make a five-minute piece about how Christianity is terrible?
[02:14:33.249 --> 02:14:38.191]  I'm sure you could show burning at the stake and wars and I get it.
[02:14:38.271 --> 02:14:39.571]  I could show Exodus 21-7.
[02:14:40.592 --> 02:14:41.852]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:14:41.992 --> 02:14:43.052]  It was a different time.
[02:14:43.493 --> 02:14:44.493]  It was a different time.
[02:14:45.213 --> 02:14:45.553]  Guess what?
[02:14:45.593 --> 02:14:46.854]  We used to also have slavery.
[02:14:47.054 --> 02:14:47.514]  Now we don't.
[02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:49.294]  Like, what are we doing here?
[02:14:49.834 --> 02:14:52.197]  I mean, I think there needs to be a reformation.
[02:14:52.697 --> 02:14:58.783]  Christianity's gone from reformation to now being a leftist monster, and it's not even Christianity anymore.
[02:14:58.823 --> 02:15:04.088]  And then I see Islam as not a reformation, other than the most radical forms of it is the reformation.
[02:15:05.009 --> 02:15:11.776]  And I see the globalist CIA trying to cause a radical reformation in Islam to turn it into a weapons system.
[02:15:12.196 --> 02:15:12.977]  I do see that.
[02:15:13.777 --> 02:15:17.438]  And here's the big enchilada, and this is a good term to use.
[02:15:17.899 --> 02:15:21.580]  Have you ever heard of al pastor, the taco?
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:22.260]  Yes.
[02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:32.904]  Okay, so al pastor is a taco, a dish developed in central Mexico that is based on shawarma, and it was meat brought by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico.
[02:15:33.345 --> 02:15:36.466]  Let me tell you something, Arabs look a lot like Mexicans.
[02:15:37.199 --> 02:15:51.171]  Okay, so there is a crisis on the border because you got fundamentalist gangs coming through that border, and we're so focused on, you know, demonizing a religion, and you're about to get a swarm, but if we could work together, we can we can nix this.
[02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:52.052]  I've been a part of it.
[02:15:52.072 --> 02:15:53.253]  I know what happened at Fort Hood.
[02:15:53.293 --> 02:15:54.674]  I know what happened with Nassar Abdo.
[02:15:55.054 --> 02:15:55.895]  They're gonna arrest me.
[02:15:55.955 --> 02:15:56.816]  They're gonna roll me up.
[02:15:56.856 --> 02:15:57.356]  I don't care.
[02:15:57.376 --> 02:16:00.018]  Hey, Houma, Houma, come meet me down in Cuba.
[02:16:00.639 --> 02:16:01.319]  I got right back.
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:01.720]  Stay with us.
[02:16:04.682 --> 02:16:09.143]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:16:09.363 --> 02:16:14.044]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:16:14.664 --> 02:16:20.505]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[02:16:20.925 --> 02:16:33.507]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:16:34.287 --> 02:16:35.848]  Unlike other systems.
[02:16:35.888 --> 02:16:41.392]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[02:16:41.412 --> 02:16:42.994]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:16:43.014 --> 02:16:44.895]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:16:45.215 --> 02:16:46.396]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:16:46.496 --> 02:16:47.597]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:16:47.617 --> 02:16:49.018]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:16:49.138 --> 02:16:50.698]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:16:51.198 --> 02:16:52.799]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:16:52.819 --> 02:16:54.619]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:16:54.959 --> 02:16:57.580]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.460]  This is insane.
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:00.500]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:03.301]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:17:03.761 --> 02:17:05.281]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:17:05.321 --> 02:17:07.142]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:17:07.162 --> 02:17:09.022]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:17:09.882 --> 02:17:15.804]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:17:16.064 --> 02:17:17.404]  All just moderate dose.
[02:17:18.936 --> 02:17:26.928]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain that Mother Nature, God gave us through Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:17:26.948 --> 02:17:29.292]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:17:29.352 --> 02:17:30.534]  But thank you for committing.
[02:17:34.577 --> 02:17:37.419]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:40.382]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:17:40.402 --> 02:17:45.185]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:17:45.645 --> 02:17:51.770]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:17:51.810 --> 02:17:54.912]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:17:55.253 --> 02:17:56.554]  It's called reap what you show.
[02:18:05.353 --> 02:18:08.777]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[02:18:09.097 --> 02:18:10.439]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[02:18:10.459 --> 02:18:11.300]  This is my favorite.
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:13.862]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[02:18:14.243 --> 02:18:15.164]  I mean, really, it's true.
[02:18:15.204 --> 02:18:18.247]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[02:18:18.407 --> 02:18:20.349]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[02:18:20.449 --> 02:18:23.413]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[02:18:23.493 --> 02:18:27.357]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before with these two here.
[02:18:27.677 --> 02:18:31.960]  I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working at the end of doing a broadcast.
[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:33.321]  I have the energy to go to a gym.
[02:18:33.401 --> 02:18:36.903]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[02:18:36.943 --> 02:18:37.723]  It's heartbreaking.
[02:18:37.763 --> 02:18:39.985]  The super male vitality is about to go away.
[02:18:40.025 --> 02:18:43.387]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[02:18:43.407 --> 02:18:44.648]  Yeah, but that's what it's all about.
[02:18:44.668 --> 02:18:45.868]  This is the real deal.
[02:18:45.908 --> 02:18:49.610]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day, and all of a sudden it's like, whoa!
[02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:50.651]  I'm a man again!
[02:18:50.911 --> 02:18:56.034]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[02:18:56.114 --> 02:18:56.734]  It's back!
[02:18:57.114 --> 02:18:59.756]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[02:18:59.896 --> 02:19:04.678]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[02:19:04.818 --> 02:19:07.139]  Everybody loves everything in the InfoWars store.
[02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:08.880]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.942]  You're supporting the show, you're supporting the InfoWars, and really,
[02:19:12.222 --> 02:19:13.963]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes,
[02:19:42.102 --> 02:19:43.983]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:44.696 --> 02:20:45.817]  We're going to your phone calls.
[02:20:45.877 --> 02:20:52.021]  Alex Jones here back live from Muslim callers, people who are formerly Muslim, and I appreciate everybody calling in.
[02:20:52.921 --> 02:20:59.225]  We've got Shomer, Mo, Alex, Ian, Charles, Antoine, Ammar, and Abdul.
[02:21:00.266 --> 02:21:01.767]  And who's been home the longest here?
[02:21:01.827 --> 02:21:03.868]  That would be Mo, and then we'll go to Abdul.
[02:21:03.888 --> 02:21:05.249]  We'll get everybody in order here.
[02:21:05.849 --> 02:21:08.411]  We got Zachary riding shotgun with us.
[02:21:09.633 --> 02:21:09.893]  Hello.
[02:21:09.913 --> 02:21:10.253]  Can you hear me?
[02:21:10.273 --> 02:21:10.453]  I can.
[02:21:10.473 --> 02:21:10.793]  Welcome.
[02:21:10.813 --> 02:21:12.254]  You're on the air.
[02:21:33.737 --> 02:21:34.097]  Thank you.
[02:21:35.177 --> 02:21:37.198]  Can your man riding shotgun hear me as well?
[02:21:37.218 --> 02:21:38.878]  I want to kind of have a debate with him.
[02:21:38.938 --> 02:21:39.678]  I think he might like this.
[02:21:41.459 --> 02:21:42.019]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:21:43.519 --> 02:21:51.481]  Okay, well, basically, to summarize, you're 100% right that these people are stealing religion.
[02:21:51.521 --> 02:21:53.801]  They're thieves of religion, for example.
[02:21:53.821 --> 02:21:58.122]  Well, everyone calls the Illuminati, but basically the point is that
[02:21:59.585 --> 02:22:10.233]  You know, international banking and usury was outlawed for Christians and Muslims for a while, but then they switched and they started giving international banking a try and taking loans.
[02:22:10.614 --> 02:22:16.918]  In order to start off, they took a loan from the existing international banking order, and so basically they are all connected 100%.
[02:22:17.359 --> 02:22:19.741]  They're friends and they work together 100%.
[02:22:19.781 --> 02:22:28.227]  The Vatican, the Mecca-based Islam, probably also Turkey, as well as
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:31.962]  The Pope said last year that there is no hell.
[02:22:58.493 --> 02:22:58.833]  Exactly.
[02:22:58.873 --> 02:23:00.214]  That's obviously against the Bible.
[02:23:00.274 --> 02:23:01.014]  So those are fake.
[02:23:01.194 --> 02:23:03.556]  No offense, but that is a fake Christian organization.
[02:23:03.576 --> 02:23:04.516]  There's a lot of good Catholics.
[02:23:04.856 --> 02:23:05.677]  There's a lot of good Muslims.
[02:23:05.697 --> 02:23:06.757]  There's a lot of good Jews.
[02:23:07.158 --> 02:23:08.378]  I totally agree with what you're saying.
[02:23:08.418 --> 02:23:08.778]  Exactly.
[02:23:09.219 --> 02:23:09.579]  It's true.
[02:23:09.599 --> 02:23:10.780]  You can't judge Muslims.
[02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:12.120]  You can't judge Jews.
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:16.182]  You can't judge Catholics, Christians, whatever, because there are good people in all those groups.
[02:23:16.302 --> 02:23:18.764]  But the leadership is what I'm saying is bad.
[02:23:18.784 --> 02:23:21.865]  I mean, the Vatican right now is literally run by a guy that protects pedophiles.
[02:23:22.986 --> 02:23:23.526]  100 percent.
[02:23:23.566 --> 02:23:26.768]  And so basically what is going on right now
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.000]  We're good.
[02:23:50.217 --> 02:24:00.684]  It says that Jesus is still alive, that Jesus is the Word of God, that Jesus is the Spirit of God, and that Jesus is alive and that Jesus is coming back to judge the world.
[02:24:01.184 --> 02:24:06.088]  Not only that, this is... So then why do we see these different Muslim groups blowing up churches and throwing down crosses?
[02:24:07.287 --> 02:24:12.692]  They are fake Muslims, the same way there are fake Jews and there are fake Christians.
[02:24:12.913 --> 02:24:14.995]  So our strategy, you keep asking, so what are we going to do?
[02:24:15.315 --> 02:24:23.443]  What we're going to do, what we need to do, is we need to instead of saying that we are against Muslims, we need to say, hey, it says in the Quran,
[02:24:24.161 --> 02:24:25.403]  That you're supposed to believe in Jesus.
[02:24:25.663 --> 02:24:26.364]  Well, it does say that.
[02:24:26.384 --> 02:24:27.445]  I appreciate your call.
[02:24:27.506 --> 02:24:29.388]  I'm impressed by these Muslim call girls, to be honest.
[02:24:30.109 --> 02:24:31.411]  The way they're forming their points and everything.
[02:24:31.451 --> 02:24:32.392]  And I've actually read the Koran.
[02:24:32.432 --> 02:24:32.973]  It does say that.
[02:24:33.694 --> 02:24:38.400]  And I agree with what our guest is saying, Zachary Claywon, is that...
[02:24:39.221 --> 02:24:42.582]  The globalists think we're obsolete and say AI is taking over, they're going to get rid of everybody.
[02:24:42.602 --> 02:24:44.083]  I mean, that is a fact.
[02:24:44.803 --> 02:24:48.404]  Smartphones are making our kids not have relationships.
[02:24:48.744 --> 02:24:49.524]  Everyone's dying.
[02:24:49.624 --> 02:24:50.605]  Everyone's getting autism.
[02:24:50.665 --> 02:24:52.105]  Everyone's getting cancer at record rates.
[02:24:52.405 --> 02:24:54.186]  There is a greater evil above all this.
[02:24:54.566 --> 02:25:00.868]  I just don't want to watch leftist defense of radical Islam and its expansion and then the constant hatred of Christianity.
[02:25:01.148 --> 02:25:06.449]  That's where I then go on the rampage against what I see Islam as today.
[02:25:06.489 --> 02:25:07.250]  But Zack, what do you say to that?
[02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:08.150]  That was a pretty smart caller.
[02:25:09.326 --> 02:25:11.207]  Absolutely a smart call, and he's correct.
[02:25:11.287 --> 02:25:12.988]  I mean, come on, we're a family.
[02:25:13.189 --> 02:25:14.289]  We're a human being family.
[02:25:14.770 --> 02:25:16.711]  Everyone has had dysfunction in a family.
[02:25:17.051 --> 02:25:19.493]  An aunt here, a brother here, a kid there.
[02:25:19.553 --> 02:25:22.054]  Listen, we went our separate ways at the starting point.
[02:25:22.375 --> 02:25:23.675]  We are connected.
[02:25:23.816 --> 02:25:25.337]  Do not listen to the propaganda.
[02:25:25.557 --> 02:25:28.959]  And I just gotta say this right now, and I'm gonna let these callers keep on rolling, because it's great.
[02:25:29.019 --> 02:25:30.060]  And then you guys got the picture.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:33.282]  But I wanna make one thing clear, because I'm probably gonna get in trouble for what I'm saying.
[02:25:33.742 --> 02:25:34.763]  I'm gonna say it right now.
[02:25:35.443 --> 02:25:38.926]  Um, you guys got the picture of my, uh, oath here when I was in the United States Army.
[02:25:39.086 --> 02:25:40.207]  Well, put it on the screen and we have it.
[02:25:40.247 --> 02:25:40.527]  Go ahead.
[02:25:40.747 --> 02:25:42.268]  Yeah, I'm gonna read it right now.
[02:25:43.269 --> 02:26:00.102]  I, Zachary Lee Claiwan, do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States of America.
[02:26:00.854 --> 02:26:08.628]  And the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, so help me God!
[02:26:09.369 --> 02:26:12.190]  So, I don't intend on breaking that oath.
[02:26:12.931 --> 02:26:15.392]  I intend on exposing this, whatever they're going to do with it.
[02:26:15.412 --> 02:26:17.613]  Yeah, but you haven't given out any secret stuff you saw.
[02:26:17.673 --> 02:26:22.395]  It's well known that the CIA knew that that guy was going to attack Fort Hood and stood down.
[02:26:22.435 --> 02:26:23.535]  That came out in mainstream news.
[02:26:24.316 --> 02:26:25.476]  I knew what was going on.
[02:26:25.636 --> 02:26:27.857]  Listen, they had the state... People look it up.
[02:26:27.917 --> 02:26:28.718]  Now you know the name.
[02:26:28.758 --> 02:26:34.980]  They allowed the State Department via VOA to come do a documentary on me through Fort Hood gates, in every way.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.381]  Sure, they were using you as propaganda.
[02:26:37.296 --> 02:26:40.208]  And I caught him, and I double-crossed him, and it ain't gonna happen.
[02:26:40.228 --> 02:26:41.051]  I saw what they're doing.
[02:26:41.091 --> 02:26:41.332]  Listen.
[02:26:42.369 --> 02:26:44.310]  Listen, I'm from the Kingdom of Morocco.
[02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:49.272]  It's the longest-standing treaty in the history of this country, the Friendship Treaty of Morocco and America.
[02:26:49.532 --> 02:26:50.653]  My father is a veteran.
[02:26:50.893 --> 02:26:55.975]  My grandfather, who's a Moroccan, fought in the Korean War with the Allied forces against them.
[02:26:56.295 --> 02:26:57.576]  I don't know what people think.
[02:26:57.716 --> 02:26:58.856]  I have the timeline.
[02:26:59.336 --> 02:27:07.360]  This is a class of civilizations, and the only people who benefit from this are the architects who are globalists, and I see right through them, and I can see them.
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:08.681]  And I don't like them.
[02:27:08.961 --> 02:27:23.090]  And when we were forced to go to that Fort Hood funeral and to see Hussein and Michael, excuse me, and Michelle saluting the boots, it bothered me in a way that I cannot describe.
[02:27:23.410 --> 02:27:26.032]  And when that individual was talking about banking, that's great.
[02:27:26.392 --> 02:27:27.633]  What they did to Gaddafi,
[02:27:28.416 --> 02:27:29.457]  With raw gold.
[02:27:29.797 --> 02:27:31.238]  He wanted to get out of the system.
[02:27:31.518 --> 02:27:32.738]  He turned the nukes over.
[02:27:33.059 --> 02:27:35.000]  They came and sodomized him with a sword.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:39.362]  Yeah, he rolled over and gave the West everything and they killed him.
[02:27:40.182 --> 02:27:41.763]  And they created ISIS from that.
[02:27:41.803 --> 02:27:42.363]  That's Hillary.
[02:27:42.403 --> 02:27:43.124]  That's Obama.
[02:27:43.364 --> 02:27:44.905]  So those tweets... Let me ask you this briefly.
[02:27:44.925 --> 02:27:45.945]  We're going to break and make more calls.
[02:27:46.005 --> 02:27:48.046]  Why do you think the establishment hates Trump so much?
[02:27:49.267 --> 02:27:50.348]  Well, because he knows this.
[02:27:51.008 --> 02:27:52.189]  Because he's trying to save the planet.
[02:27:52.229 --> 02:27:53.609]  He knows we're going multi-planetary.
[02:27:53.649 --> 02:27:54.710]  The hypnosis is over.
[02:27:55.276 --> 02:27:56.277]  They have to go along.
[02:27:56.317 --> 02:27:59.059]  Their karmatic balance is over, and I don't care.
[02:27:59.479 --> 02:28:00.340]  I do not care.
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:01.781]  I've had my issues.
[02:28:02.021 --> 02:28:13.770]  I'm not perfect, but I am truthful right now, and I'm doing better than I ever have been, and I will fight till it's over, and I got a lot to say, and it needs to be exposed, and I guess that's what I'm here to do, and I'm gonna do it.
[02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:16.652]  Well, it's good you got your head screwed on straight, because I've talked to you a lot on the phone, to people that know you.
[02:28:16.692 --> 02:28:22.637]  You're a smart guy, made a lot of good points, and sometimes we all go off the rails, but we're gonna come back and go bam, bam, bam, so these folks don't have to hold too long.
[02:28:23.370 --> 02:28:30.954]  We're going to go to Abdul, and then we're going to go next up and hold the next longest, Ammar, and then Ian, and then Alex.
[02:28:30.994 --> 02:28:31.995]  We're going to get a bam, bam, bam.
[02:28:32.015 --> 02:28:32.795]  These are all great callers.
[02:28:32.815 --> 02:28:35.397]  We've only got two segments left, so we've got to go quick.
[02:28:36.137 --> 02:28:38.779]  Please don't forget, you don't financially support us, we're not here.
[02:28:39.159 --> 02:28:44.802]  The big t-shirt sale, 50% off all apparel, ball caps, you name it, has to end tomorrow.
[02:28:44.822 --> 02:28:45.543]  50% off all the apparel.
[02:28:45.803 --> 02:28:49.325]  We have a new special just launched, and a bottle of Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic.
[02:28:49.705 --> 02:28:54.210]  For 25% off, you get a free bottle of our best-selling Sleep Aid All-Natural Knockout.
[02:28:54.631 --> 02:28:56.233]  That is a powerful one-two punch.
[02:28:56.733 --> 02:28:58.055]  That comes out to over 50% off.
[02:28:58.135 --> 02:28:59.336]  Rainforest with that free bottle.
[02:28:59.656 --> 02:29:00.578]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:02.296 --> 02:29:06.259]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:29:06.619 --> 02:29:12.523]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:29:12.943 --> 02:29:18.827]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:29:19.127 --> 02:29:21.769]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:29:22.049 --> 02:29:29.553]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:29:29.573 --> 02:29:37.757]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[02:29:38.378 --> 02:29:42.620]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[02:29:43.487 --> 02:29:47.128]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:29:47.308 --> 02:29:53.271]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[02:29:54.251 --> 02:30:03.094]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[02:30:03.655 --> 02:30:07.816]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[02:30:07.856 --> 02:30:09.617]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[02:30:10.694 --> 02:30:12.560]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[02:30:13.022 --> 02:30:13.825]  It was the last run.
[02:30:13.845 --> 02:30:14.788]  It's been sold out for two months.
[02:30:15.885 --> 02:30:16.766]  How is X2 back?
[02:30:17.226 --> 02:30:20.848]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[02:30:21.308 --> 02:30:24.390]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[02:30:24.970 --> 02:30:35.016]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[02:30:35.076 --> 02:30:39.018]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[02:30:39.438 --> 02:30:40.579]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:30:40.999 --> 02:30:45.341]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[02:30:45.802 --> 02:30:47.583]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[02:30:48.003 --> 02:30:49.304]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[02:30:49.844 --> 02:30:52.105]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[02:30:52.565 --> 02:30:54.907]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[02:30:55.527 --> 02:30:59.029]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[02:30:59.849 --> 02:31:02.311]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[02:31:03.357 --> 02:31:05.679]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[02:31:06.139 --> 02:31:18.487]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[02:31:19.008 --> 02:31:21.509]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:23.230]  So iodine is amazing.
[02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.831]  It's important.
[02:31:23.851 --> 02:31:26.092]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[02:31:26.152 --> 02:31:26.673]  They'll hurt you.
[02:31:27.053 --> 02:31:27.753]  This is pure.
[02:31:28.014 --> 02:31:28.734]  This is clean.
[02:31:29.074 --> 02:31:29.855]  This is amazing.
[02:31:30.175 --> 02:31:31.976]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[02:31:33.497 --> 02:31:37.139]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[02:31:37.459 --> 02:31:42.201]  X2 Original from the very first original manufacturer.

[02:33:05.847 --> 02:33:08.511]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.561 --> 02:33:25.263]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.604 --> 02:33:30.146]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[02:33:32.407 --> 02:33:35.669]  Something you call love, but confess.
[02:33:38.090 --> 02:33:39.951]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:33:40.051 --> 02:33:44.953]  Any powerful belief system or institution is going to get corrupted and used for power.
[02:33:45.033 --> 02:33:47.695]  Those are different phases of Islam, Christianity, Judaism.
[02:33:49.087 --> 02:33:56.711]  But we know there is this godless, transhumanist system that is actually not godless.
[02:33:56.751 --> 02:34:00.594]  They believe in the devil, and their god wants the end of the family, end of humanity.
[02:34:00.614 --> 02:34:01.614]  So I'll give Islam this.
[02:34:03.855 --> 02:34:12.620]  And it goes to extremes, but it's Muslims in Europe getting this sex education of five-year-olds, teaching them how to give blowjobs, literally banned.
[02:34:13.141 --> 02:34:14.482]  So Muslims protesting and saying no.
[02:34:15.706 --> 02:34:22.169]  And it is the Muslims that are standing up against drag queen story times and stuff like that.
[02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:24.250]  So that's that whole paradox though.
[02:34:24.270 --> 02:34:36.395]  Here's the left that wants to sexualize kids and then they're sitting there promoting Islam, even the most radical forms of it, that would kill them just for sex out of wedlock or whatever.
[02:34:38.041 --> 02:34:41.323]  It's all just a big, giant mess.
[02:34:41.663 --> 02:34:53.288]  But there's no doubt the Left is anti-Christian, so it sees Islam in all its forms and permutations, very diverse, as something it wants to overwrite the West with.
[02:34:53.308 --> 02:34:55.069]  And this is not going to go well, I can tell you.
[02:34:55.089 --> 02:34:56.850]  It's going to be very explosive.
[02:34:59.051 --> 02:35:06.835]  Our guest is here with us, Zachary Claywan, whistleblower, Rambo.zaq on Facebook.
[02:35:07.941 --> 02:35:10.862]  And I want him to be able to continue, but these callers have been really holding patiently.
[02:35:12.083 --> 02:35:16.665]  So let's go to Abdul and then Ammar and Ian and everybody else.
[02:35:17.265 --> 02:35:18.606]  Abdul, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:35:18.626 --> 02:35:18.946]  Go ahead.
[02:35:20.467 --> 02:35:21.467]  Hi, good day, sir.
[02:35:21.767 --> 02:35:22.288]  Hi, welcome.
[02:35:23.628 --> 02:35:24.569]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:35:24.969 --> 02:35:31.512]  Yeah, I just want to phone as a Muslim to validate some of the things you've been saying and endorse some of the things you've been saying.
[02:35:32.361 --> 02:36:01.709]  Because the biggest issue right now is what you said about the Muslim leadership not speaking out against this type of thing that are going on and the atrocities and they need to be put on blast because there's a whole there's a whole network not just in the UK but particularly in your country to do with the universities yeah I think Berkeley and all them places then where there is an intellectual elite within the academic Muslim world
[02:36:02.731 --> 02:36:08.095]  And they've had a program going on for at least, I know, for at least 30 years here in England.
[02:36:08.375 --> 02:36:15.840]  Because 30 years ago there was Turkish so-called imams coming over to England talking about, you know, setting up a Muslim community in it.
[02:36:16.201 --> 02:36:17.402]  And it is a big program.
[02:36:17.442 --> 02:36:20.844]  I don't want to go into all the geopolitical issues around it.
[02:36:20.884 --> 02:36:23.906]  You're saying the left is commandeering the imams?
[02:36:23.946 --> 02:36:25.087]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:25.147 --> 02:36:26.428]  For a long time, man.
[02:36:26.568 --> 02:36:28.149]  Long time they've been doing it.
[02:36:28.329 --> 02:36:28.930]  Long time.
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:50.970]  I think what we're getting here is, and the proof is there, the left is taking over Islam, radicalizing it, and using it as an operating system of dominance.
[02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:52.510]  I think that's where you're going.
[02:36:53.091 --> 02:36:55.752]  Don't hang up, but I want to get Zach's take on what we're saying here.
[02:36:55.792 --> 02:36:55.992]  Zach?
[02:36:57.613 --> 02:36:59.174]  I think this is extraordinary.
[02:36:59.234 --> 02:37:02.355]  I think this is the type of constructive conversation that needed to occur.
[02:37:03.395 --> 02:37:04.576]  This is imperative.
[02:37:05.316 --> 02:37:07.417]  And it's point blank.
[02:37:07.817 --> 02:37:08.618]  Look at the money.
[02:37:08.938 --> 02:37:10.338]  Just follow the money.
[02:37:11.319 --> 02:37:14.500]  The most radical forms of this, how are they able to operate?
[02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:16.301]  Where did the money come from?
[02:37:16.881 --> 02:37:17.401]  Look at it.
[02:37:17.941 --> 02:37:18.802]  We funded what?
[02:37:19.042 --> 02:37:20.382]  The moderate rebels?
[02:37:21.343 --> 02:37:22.223]  That became what?
[02:37:23.564 --> 02:37:23.804]  ISIS.
[02:37:25.382 --> 02:37:26.643]  So follow the money.
[02:37:26.823 --> 02:37:33.148]  It's not these low-level... Listen, if you go to downtown Los Angeles, South Side of Chicago, there's Crips, there's MS-13.
[02:37:33.729 --> 02:37:35.090]  Those are terrorist organizations.
[02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:36.671]  They just happen to be Americans.
[02:37:37.232 --> 02:37:40.935]  So when they're used geopolitically as chess pieces, it's different.
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:51.173]  This is a geopolitical... No, I'd say the fact that the globalists and the leftists and even under Bush, the right wing is using Islam... Where are the WMDs?
[02:37:51.253 --> 02:37:54.477]  ...and putting the most radical ones in for a larger system.
[02:37:54.497 --> 02:37:56.540]  So, Abdul, from the UK, what do you think?
[02:37:57.884 --> 02:38:16.614]  Yeah, this is the only point I want to make because I'm nobody, I've just compelled to phone because I've heard a lot, listened to what you've said and Zac, Zac's the man really who's in a position, sophisticated enough, who's got the connections and knows the networks of the people who are doing all this, is that they need to be put on blast.
[02:38:17.074 --> 02:38:35.065]  And the so-called Muslim intellectuals and theological intellectuals who say, oh, Islam is a peaceful religion, the Prophet never done this, show us, because I know it's there in Islam, about the Prophet never done any offensive violence, the Prophet disassociated himself with people who chopped people's heads off.
[02:38:35.145 --> 02:38:36.746]  Let's just expand on this.
[02:38:37.086 --> 02:38:41.709]  England lets ISIS fighters come back and gives them better treatment than veterans.
[02:38:42.149 --> 02:38:46.893]  So the people running England want to protect these worst forms of Islam.
[02:38:47.333 --> 02:39:00.261]  You could say then to basically slander Islam, allow that to expand, like Brennan converted to it, and then use that evil form of Islam to have the West rise up and smash it in a giant war.
[02:39:00.421 --> 02:39:01.842]  And that's clearly where they're going.
[02:39:01.862 --> 02:39:02.462]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:03.103 --> 02:39:04.604]  Zach, a quick comment before we take another call.
[02:39:06.027 --> 02:39:07.228]  This is extraordinary.
[02:39:07.308 --> 02:39:15.312]  I think this conversation is going to be... Wow.
[02:39:15.492 --> 02:39:16.333]  I'm kind of overwhelmed.
[02:39:16.353 --> 02:39:17.474]  I'm a little emotional right now.
[02:39:17.514 --> 02:39:19.495]  This is exactly the conversation that needed to happen.
[02:39:19.775 --> 02:39:31.902]  As I was watching that piece yesterday, I know you guys were coming from a good place, but I'm like, the picture needs to be painted because we're human beings and as we fight each other and we degrade each other, technology is advancing.
[02:39:32.789 --> 02:39:36.371]  But Zach, I know we're losing our humanity, we're losing our genetics, we're all dying right now.
[02:39:36.391 --> 02:39:37.831]  It's true.
[02:39:38.312 --> 02:39:45.895]  We had to counterbalance the leftist cover-up with something that invokes and shows the dirty side of something to then have the debate.
[02:39:46.516 --> 02:39:47.957]  They know the Muslims will fight.
[02:39:48.137 --> 02:39:48.838]  They're warriors.
[02:39:49.098 --> 02:39:50.560]  They know the Americans will fight.
[02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:51.180]  They're warriors.
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:55.624]  So when you get the two toughest individuals on the planet to fight, it's over.
[02:39:55.704 --> 02:39:57.025]  The Chinese have no conscience.
[02:39:57.305 --> 02:39:59.607]  They just want consumerism.
[02:39:59.868 --> 02:40:00.708]  They just want money.
[02:40:00.989 --> 02:40:03.431]  But it's going to move to an AI movement.
[02:40:03.491 --> 02:40:04.712]  We have to have an AI movement.
[02:40:04.912 --> 02:40:08.255]  Those tweets by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are like, uh, I don't know.
[02:40:08.275 --> 02:40:10.497]  Like, that might be the most evil thing I've ever seen.
[02:40:10.877 --> 02:40:12.778]  What do you think about them all calling them Easter worshipers?
[02:40:12.798 --> 02:40:14.420]  Listen, let me tell you something.
[02:40:35.012 --> 02:40:36.593]  That guy, I have a problem with that guy.
[02:40:36.813 --> 02:40:41.515]  And Secret Service, listen, I read my oath of enlistment, I'm not a threat to anybody.
[02:40:41.975 --> 02:40:47.517]  Those two people need to be tried for treason, and not just them, there's a lot of them, and I'm dead serious.
[02:40:48.117 --> 02:40:55.140]  This is not, they attempted to ruin this country because their karmatic balance is off, and they got caught.
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:41:01.263]  And I know Trump knows what I'm saying, it's difficult to operate in that space, but believe me, these people are not our friends.
[02:41:01.323 --> 02:41:03.884]  I witnessed it at Fort Hood on several occasions,
[02:41:04.204 --> 02:41:07.746]  And I fought back, and I don't know what's going to happen to me, but I'm not putting up with it.
[02:41:08.186 --> 02:41:09.286]  It's not, it's not okay.
[02:41:09.587 --> 02:41:11.047]  It's not okay.
[02:41:11.127 --> 02:41:13.268]  Well, remember, they are helping stage terror attacks.
[02:41:13.428 --> 02:41:15.349]  Okay, who's up for the next longest here?
[02:41:15.369 --> 02:41:18.591]  We'll go to Ammar next, but it's Ian right now in Arizona.
[02:41:18.911 --> 02:41:19.451]  You're on the air.
[02:41:19.491 --> 02:41:23.553]  You say you're a Muslim convert, currently Christian, on Islamic terror, whatever that means.
[02:41:23.573 --> 02:41:24.754]  Tell us what that means.
[02:41:26.958 --> 02:41:29.700]  No, I think he just miswrote it down.
[02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:32.182]  I just said that I wanted to talk about the terror attacks.
[02:41:32.302 --> 02:41:35.325]  Actually, Alex, I wanted to talk about two or three things.
[02:41:35.425 --> 02:41:45.054]  One, I want to kind of say some of the same things that some of the other callers said, and I did want to talk about the bombings that just happened.
[02:41:45.074 --> 02:41:45.274]  Sure.
[02:41:45.294 --> 02:41:50.279]  Go ahead and start, and we'll come back to you after the break, and I promise we'll get to Ammar, Chef, and Schelmer.
[02:41:50.299 --> 02:41:50.519]  Go ahead.
[02:41:52.958 --> 02:41:53.639]  Okay, thank you.
[02:41:53.659 --> 02:41:57.143]  And I wanted to say too, Zach, man, I was just wondering when I was going to hear from you again.
[02:41:57.163 --> 02:42:00.267]  You're one of my favorite guests that Alex has.
[02:42:00.327 --> 02:42:08.657]  But the first thing I wanted to say, what we were talking about earlier, what you were talking about with some of the other callers about Jesus, I used to be a Muslim.
[02:42:08.697 --> 02:42:10.058]  I was a Muslim for eight years.
[02:42:11.519 --> 02:42:13.960]  The same, even, I mean, like you said, it's real complex.
[02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:18.402]  There's different, you have different, the left and the right, different versions of the same thing.
[02:42:18.443 --> 02:42:23.145]  But one thing that I noticed was that Jesus is the most mentioned person in the Quran.
[02:42:23.705 --> 02:42:37.072]  And like you said, Jesus is spoke of in the Quran as being a sinless man and being this, you know, even though they just try to call him a prophet, when you read the Quran and you read it several times, you can't help but notice that Jesus is like
[02:42:38.385 --> 02:42:41.488]  I don't want to say more powerful, but yeah, he's that guy.
[02:42:41.528 --> 02:42:42.149]  You know what I mean?
[02:42:42.449 --> 02:42:44.110]  And so even the Quran admits that.
[02:42:44.151 --> 02:42:47.213]  So that was one thing that I wanted to validate that the caller had said earlier.
[02:43:07.301 --> 02:43:09.021]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:43:09.622 --> 02:43:11.442]  Our most advanced formula yet.
[02:43:14.803 --> 02:43:25.326]  DNA Force Plus is focused on overhauling your body's cellular engines and supporting your optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[02:43:28.168 --> 02:43:36.711]  DNA Force Plus contains a combination of the best adaptogens on the market to help your body adapt and bend, not break.
[02:43:37.252 --> 02:43:41.673]  Hand-picked adaptogen herbs help protect your body on a cellular level.
[02:43:42.294 --> 02:43:48.476]  It's time to try the newest version of one of our most powerful formulas yet with DNA Force Plus.
[02:43:54.824 --> 02:43:56.865]  Available at infowarslife.com today.
[02:43:56.885 --> 02:43:57.366]  Now, normally...
[02:44:14.431 --> 02:44:22.714]  When I drink TurboForce, I usually like to drink it before the war room, and I get a kick, and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[02:44:22.835 --> 02:44:23.995]  I get to work out it and everything.
[02:44:24.575 --> 02:44:28.437]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some BrainForce+.
[02:44:28.517 --> 02:44:36.920]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:40.282]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[02:44:41.122 --> 02:44:42.023]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:42.043 --> 02:44:49.526]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:49.567 --> 02:44:51.467]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[02:44:51.568 --> 02:44:52.348]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[02:44:52.408 --> 02:44:53.969]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[02:44:54.009 --> 02:44:58.071]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[02:44:58.251 --> 02:44:59.712]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[02:44:59.852 --> 02:45:03.654]  Me stirring a cup of turbo force has never looked so good.
[02:45:03.994 --> 02:45:09.617]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out of turbo force with this one, folks, so you better go to Infowarsstore.com immediately, alright?
[02:45:09.657 --> 02:45:10.277]  You think I got it?
[02:45:10.337 --> 02:45:12.818]  Look at the turbo force spinning so eloquently.
[02:45:12.999 --> 02:45:16.881]  Nothing to disturb it, just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[02:45:17.081 --> 02:45:22.904]  Yes, ah, I'm thinking of my turbo force and how great it's going to make me feel.
[02:45:23.664 --> 02:45:29.813]  In the pure energy that I'm gonna get from my turbo force at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:30.814 --> 02:45:31.275]  Yes.
[02:45:32.096 --> 02:45:33.458]  Total equilibrium.
[02:45:35.183 --> 02:45:36.443]  Find your chi.
[02:45:36.663 --> 02:45:40.664]  Find the energy with TurboForce at InfowarStore.com.
[02:45:41.444 --> 02:45:44.845]  I'm getting ready for a long four-hour broadcast and I need my energy.
[02:45:44.865 --> 02:45:53.547]  I'm sipping TurboForce mixed with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:54.527 --> 02:45:55.227]  It's magic.
[02:45:56.207 --> 02:45:59.288]  It's TurboForce from InfowarStore.com.
[02:46:03.137 --> 02:46:05.098]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:46:05.198 --> 02:46:05.538]  Go ahead.
[02:46:05.838 --> 02:46:08.059]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[02:46:08.199 --> 02:46:11.079]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:46:11.900 --> 02:46:13.000]  It just gets old, man.
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:15.061]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:46:15.761 --> 02:46:17.842]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:46:18.082 --> 02:46:22.063]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:46:22.083 --> 02:46:24.564]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:46:25.384 --> 02:46:27.685]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:46:27.705 --> 02:46:29.225]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:46:29.425 --> 02:46:30.326]  Us being shut down?
[02:46:30.546 --> 02:46:31.586]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:46:32.006 --> 02:46:33.066]  You know what, Alex?
[02:46:33.107 --> 02:46:34.167]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:46:34.187 --> 02:46:35.027]  Hey, Frank!
[02:46:35.287 --> 02:46:40.650]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:45.252]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:46:45.472 --> 02:46:48.353]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:46:48.613 --> 02:46:48.993]  You understand?
[02:46:49.073 --> 02:46:50.354]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:46:50.714 --> 02:46:51.894]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:46:52.855 --> 02:46:57.777]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:46:58.737 --> 02:46:59.417]  Do you understand?
[02:46:59.437 --> 02:47:00.618]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:47:06.764 --> 02:47:09.506]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.354 --> 02:47:22.377]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:26.915]  Resistance to titans is obedience to God.
[02:47:27.636 --> 02:47:29.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.218 --> 02:47:32.843]  Let's hear it for Bridget Gabriel, then we'll go back to our Muslim callers.
[02:47:33.284 --> 02:47:37.730]  And we've got an active military fellow that must argue with Zach, but here's what she had to say in front of the UN.
[02:47:39.457 --> 02:47:42.238]  There are 1.2 billion Muslims in the world today.
[02:47:42.518 --> 02:47:44.539]  Of course not all of them are radicals.
[02:47:44.599 --> 02:47:46.540]  The majority of them are peaceful people.
[02:47:47.001 --> 02:47:55.745]  The radicals are estimated to be between 15 to 25% according to all intelligence services around the world.
[02:47:56.205 --> 02:47:57.906]  That leaves 75% of them peaceful people.
[02:48:00.447 --> 02:48:11.912]  But when you look at 15-25% of the world Muslim population, you're looking at 180 million to 300 million people dedicated to the destruction of Western civilization.
[02:48:11.932 --> 02:48:14.673]  That is as big as the United States.
[02:48:15.053 --> 02:48:18.494]  So why should we worry about the radicals 15-25%?
[02:48:19.755 --> 02:48:21.696]  Because it is the radicals that kill.
[02:48:22.016 --> 02:48:24.617]  Because it is the radicals that behead and massacre.
[02:48:25.057 --> 02:48:41.913]  When you look throughout history, when you look at all the lessons of history, most Germans were peaceful, yet the Nazis drove the agenda, and as a result, 60 million people died, almost 14 million in concentration camps, 6 million were Jews.
[02:48:42.414 --> 02:48:44.536]  The peaceful majority were irrelevant.
[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:53.141]  I just judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:48:53.241 --> 02:48:54.362]  And Islam's expanding.
[02:48:54.822 --> 02:48:55.783]  The left's allied with it.
[02:48:56.083 --> 02:48:57.404]  I was against invading those countries.
[02:48:57.945 --> 02:48:59.986]  I'm against putting the radicals in.
[02:49:00.106 --> 02:49:02.508]  I totally oppose the... I see there's a global agenda manipulating it.
[02:49:02.528 --> 02:49:03.048]  It doesn't matter.
[02:49:03.769 --> 02:49:06.051]  Somebody's got a hatchet and it controls Islam.
[02:49:06.391 --> 02:49:07.412]  The globalists have it in their hand.
[02:49:07.432 --> 02:49:10.074]  It's still... The hatchet's hitting me upside the head.
[02:49:11.375 --> 02:49:15.478]  I'd like to get my hands around the globalists' throat even more than I'd rather get my hands around that hatchet.
[02:49:16.482 --> 02:49:20.384]  And I get that Islam is a big, powerful religion, so it's being controlled, and it's like, who's driving it?
[02:49:20.704 --> 02:49:27.128]  And the globalists are taking all the Muslims into the seminaries and turning them into these globalist Muslims, which is incredibly bad.
[02:49:28.368 --> 02:49:31.790]  And I didn't say we'd have callers that disagree today, but I'm going to let Schmidty get in here in a little while.
[02:49:31.810 --> 02:49:38.274]  But I promise to go to Chief in New York, but first Amar in Georgia, then Shona in Oklahoma,
[02:49:39.398 --> 02:49:43.761]  Uh, and, uh, I guess I held Ian over to finish his point, uh, with Zach.
[02:49:43.821 --> 02:49:45.282]  And we're gonna do 15 minutes the next hour.
[02:49:45.302 --> 02:49:47.424]  Uh, our next guest host is fine with that.
[02:49:47.464 --> 02:49:47.964]  He's awesome.
[02:49:48.645 --> 02:49:50.066]  Uh, so, uh, Will Johnson coming up.
[02:49:50.126 --> 02:49:51.787]  He understands that overdrafts are dumb, so I go over.
[02:49:51.807 --> 02:49:53.228]  So I want to keep this debate going.
[02:49:53.248 --> 02:49:53.928]  It's very interesting.
[02:49:53.968 --> 02:49:54.729]  I think very informative.
[02:49:55.129 --> 02:49:59.813]  Ian, uh, other points from Arizona as a, uh, Muslim convert who went back to Christianity.
[02:49:59.833 --> 02:50:00.053]  Go ahead.
[02:50:01.368 --> 02:50:02.388]  Yes sir, thank you Alex.
[02:50:02.649 --> 02:50:05.070]  And I just really wanted to get your guys take on this too.
[02:50:05.130 --> 02:50:11.812]  So I believe that these bombings are, I don't want to just say they're, you know, Muslim terror attacks, but most likely they are.
[02:50:11.852 --> 02:50:14.013]  But what I want to say is, it's the same pattern.
[02:50:14.313 --> 02:50:17.735]  The same way they're trying to make the divide and conquer, which you guys were saying earlier,
[02:50:18.135 --> 02:50:30.549]  Between African Americans and white people and all the racism and Mexicans at home and blaming it on Trump is the same way now where all these bombings are trying to get Muslim against and I'm not saying there's not already division in religion.
[02:50:30.569 --> 02:50:31.651]  No, there's real problems.
[02:50:31.691 --> 02:50:35.155]  People do, there are bad people on all sides, but exactly it's being exacerbated.
[02:50:36.152 --> 02:50:36.632]  Exactly.
[02:50:37.333 --> 02:50:38.914]  It's that time and we all know.
[02:50:39.354 --> 02:50:41.616]  One thing I wanted to say too, Alex, my last point was this.
[02:50:42.337 --> 02:50:45.799]  I know this stupid thing with the Jewish debate always.
[02:50:45.839 --> 02:50:49.202]  People try to say the year is still or you're against them or this and that.
[02:50:49.542 --> 02:50:55.046]  My point I wanted to say is this, man, I love all people and I don't think anything, I don't have any hate for Jews.
[02:50:55.106 --> 02:51:00.070]  But one thing that I do understand where I think some of it comes from, but I never hear a caller
[02:51:00.812 --> 02:51:01.433]  I don't know.
[02:51:22.248 --> 02:51:37.293]  I don't have a problem with Jews, but I mean, if I go by the Bible as a Christian, I've got to see that they're going to be... Well, there are a lot of Messianic Jews, and the Bible says they'll convert at the end, but you're right that Islam accepts Jesus and Judaism doesn't, and so that's why we have open phones.
[02:51:37.313 --> 02:51:38.033]  This is a real debate.
[02:51:38.993 --> 02:51:40.053]  We're not running a cult here.
[02:51:40.093 --> 02:51:41.134]  We don't have talking points.
[02:51:41.514 --> 02:51:43.635]  We're having an open discussion about the real world.
[02:51:43.655 --> 02:51:46.296]  But just like Islam is diverse, Judaism is very diverse.
[02:51:46.336 --> 02:51:47.096]  It's like Christianity.
[02:51:47.777 --> 02:51:48.697]  Thank you so much, Ian.
[02:51:48.717 --> 02:51:50.478]  Really, this is a powerful discussion.
[02:51:50.598 --> 02:51:56.520]  I gotta say, Muslims are really calling in and are very well-spoken compared to most type debates we have.
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:52:02.142]  We have great callers, but usually it's like military or police are well-spoken, or if you call firefighters, they call in, or farmers.
[02:52:02.202 --> 02:52:03.083]  It's all real technical.
[02:52:03.403 --> 02:52:06.404]  I gotta say, Zach, the Muslims on the show have been very articulate.
[02:52:07.489 --> 02:52:08.350]  Well, absolutely.
[02:52:08.390 --> 02:52:09.432]  We're just human beings.
[02:52:09.492 --> 02:52:13.677]  We don't need to be classified as anything, but I'm just going to take a shot because Columbus did.
[02:52:14.118 --> 02:52:15.280]  Listen, man, you need to hire me.
[02:52:15.340 --> 02:52:16.822]  I don't care if I'm sweeping the floor.
[02:52:16.842 --> 02:52:18.404]  I don't even need the income.
[02:52:18.464 --> 02:52:20.907]  I just want to utilize the studio for a podcast.
[02:52:20.927 --> 02:52:21.888]  We need to make this happen.
[02:52:22.329 --> 02:52:23.390]  I've contributed a lot.
[02:52:23.791 --> 02:52:24.552]  The people want it.
[02:52:24.592 --> 02:52:25.013]  What do you say?
[02:52:25.433 --> 02:52:26.954]  Well, you know, we have to talk about that.
[02:52:26.974 --> 02:52:28.996]  You're a smart guy and I like different debates and things.
[02:52:29.576 --> 02:52:32.859]  But, you know, the problem is this is a long-distance race.
[02:52:32.879 --> 02:52:39.084]  If you do a show, you have to always do it and always take action and always execute.
[02:52:39.104 --> 02:52:39.444]  But we'll see.
[02:52:39.484 --> 02:52:40.085]  We'll talk about it.
[02:52:40.465 --> 02:52:41.326]  We're having a good debate here.
[02:52:43.548 --> 02:52:44.769]  I said I'd go to Amar first.
[02:52:44.829 --> 02:52:45.309]  We'll go to Amar.
[02:52:45.569 --> 02:52:47.071]  Amar in Georgia, then Christopher.
[02:52:47.331 --> 02:52:48.432]  Amar in Georgia, thanks for holding.
[02:52:48.452 --> 02:52:48.752]  Go ahead.
[02:52:48.772 --> 02:52:50.553]  Yeah, hi.
[02:52:50.754 --> 02:52:54.657]  I actually called because I want to learn some stuff from Fred.
[02:52:55.117 --> 02:52:59.921]  Well, your phone sounds like somebody's beating a hammer on it, so just back off of it for a minute and start over?
[02:52:59.941 --> 02:53:03.904]  Alright, is that better?
[02:53:04.204 --> 02:53:04.444]  Yes.
[02:53:05.945 --> 02:53:08.527]  Uh, yeah, I wanted to actually, like, reaffirm some of the stuff you said.
[02:53:08.547 --> 02:53:10.509]  I disagree with several of the callers.
[02:53:11.449 --> 02:53:14.712]  I don't know how accurate the prompter was for my information.
[02:53:14.732 --> 02:53:15.893]  I'm not in Bosnia.
[02:53:16.053 --> 02:53:20.436]  I was born there and forced to come to the United States as a refugee after the Civil War.
[02:53:23.499 --> 02:53:25.140]  It wasn't actually the Serbs that prompted that.
[02:53:25.701 --> 02:53:38.371]  It was the Muslims putting on live national broadcasts that any children of a mixed family, which I was because my father was a Muslim and my mother was Serbian, would be killed.
[02:53:39.071 --> 02:53:44.396]  And so my stepdad, because my father had already been killed, picked us up and we left for America.
[02:53:44.736 --> 02:53:47.378]  And we came here and now we live here and now we're citizens.
[02:53:48.299 --> 02:53:50.601]  And the thing is, a lot of the stuff that
[02:53:51.491 --> 02:53:55.472]  Everyone tries to push it, but Islam being a religion of peace, it's not.
[02:53:55.592 --> 02:53:58.032]  It was founded on violence, and it was spread through violence.
[02:53:58.492 --> 02:54:05.334]  A thousand years of Islamic conquest is how the religion was initially spread, mostly over Northern Africa.
[02:54:06.214 --> 02:54:14.556]  And my people, the Fars, spent close to a thousand years fighting them, and being enslaved by them, and being pillaged by them.
[02:54:14.596 --> 02:54:15.556]  Well, let me raise this.
[02:54:15.876 --> 02:54:18.897]  I would watch things like 15 years ago, like Kingdom of Heaven by Ridley Scott.
[02:54:20.945 --> 02:54:26.167]  It's like the Templars are bad and the Christians are bad and they invaded the Middle East.
[02:54:26.187 --> 02:54:26.928]  Well, they didn't tell you.
[02:54:27.248 --> 02:54:30.589]  It took 400 years to push to that point and turn things around.
[02:54:30.629 --> 02:54:31.529]  We were being invaded.
[02:54:31.930 --> 02:54:35.051]  And so I knew history, but I knew it wasn't really taught popularly.
[02:54:35.071 --> 02:54:42.074]  So it was very irritating to only show one snapshot of what was going on with the Templars at one spot where they finally got turned back.
[02:54:42.774 --> 02:54:44.816]  Instead of what really went on.
[02:54:44.876 --> 02:54:50.482]  So I'd seen Hollywood coddling Islam and coddling history and then knowing I wasn't for the Serbs.
[02:54:51.543 --> 02:54:55.167]  I didn't know anything about Serbia when the Clintons were bombing Belgrade with DU.
[02:54:55.267 --> 02:54:56.548]  I studied it then and learned.
[02:54:56.588 --> 02:55:00.112]  Wait, the UN admits the Muslims started it with the Croats teamed up with them.
[02:55:00.412 --> 02:55:01.233]  They killed double.
[02:55:02.054 --> 02:55:07.336]  What the Serbs did, and then I'm always only hearing about how those horrible Serbs killed these poor Muslims.
[02:55:07.796 --> 02:55:13.378]  Well, I mean, those Serbs stopped over a hundred Islamic invasions into Kosovo.
[02:55:13.458 --> 02:55:14.319]  Now it's Muslim.
[02:55:14.379 --> 02:55:15.319]  Now it's Albanian.
[02:55:15.379 --> 02:55:16.099]  It was captured.
[02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:20.461]  So I appreciate your call, and I'm sad to hear you had your family killed.
[02:55:20.481 --> 02:55:22.282]  We're gonna have more shows on this, but
[02:55:23.908 --> 02:55:25.230]  Zachary, that's the other side of this.
[02:55:25.450 --> 02:55:27.333]  What do you say to that?
[02:55:27.393 --> 02:55:30.337]  What I say is, there's a chessboard, right?
[02:55:30.537 --> 02:55:33.161]  And there's pieces, and then you have players.
[02:55:33.641 --> 02:55:36.906]  So what this individual is talking about is pieces on the chessboard.
[02:55:37.507 --> 02:55:39.289]  I'm talking about the players.
[02:55:39.529 --> 02:55:40.471]  There's levels to this.
[02:55:43.028 --> 02:55:43.648]  No, no, you're right.
[02:55:43.728 --> 02:55:47.129]  Geopolitically, the Luciferian globalists want to co-opt Islam.
[02:55:47.949 --> 02:55:50.730]  The different elements of Islam think that it's going to co-opt it.
[02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:52.670]  Those are the elites being players.
[02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:55.011]  Then you've got the people under it that are just being used.
[02:55:56.691 --> 02:55:57.991]  This goes so deep.
[02:55:58.651 --> 02:56:00.452]  We're going multi-planetary.
[02:56:01.092 --> 02:56:10.354]  If we had a quote-unquote alien invasion, do you think it matters whether you're from the Congo or... No, people would stop fighting overnight.
[02:56:11.107 --> 02:56:12.328]  Go get a blood transfusion.
[02:56:12.769 --> 02:56:14.911]  They are playing us against each other.
[02:56:15.171 --> 02:56:17.534]  There are chess pieces, and there are chess players.
[02:56:17.794 --> 02:56:18.595]  I need people to know that.
[02:56:18.835 --> 02:56:22.900]  And these people don't even know how to play chess, they're playing checkers, and they don't even know how to play checkers.
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:27.725]  I know, but at the same time, why is the left then trying to defend the most radical, virulent forms of Islam?
[02:56:28.025 --> 02:56:31.489]  You're saying to make it build up to create a crisis, so they have a big war.
[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:35.683]  So it's complete chaos and they come in as a savior.
[02:56:36.343 --> 02:56:38.985]  And as we degrade, technology advances.
[02:56:39.025 --> 02:56:41.928]  The trajectory that technology is on is imperative.
[02:56:42.228 --> 02:56:43.609]  It's going to continue.
[02:56:43.930 --> 02:56:45.391]  It's gaining consciousness.
[02:56:45.691 --> 02:56:51.276]  And like I said on several calls before, we're going to have a human future or an AI future.
[02:56:51.836 --> 02:56:52.236]  Period.
[02:56:52.517 --> 02:56:53.697]  Evolution works like that.
[02:56:53.757 --> 02:56:58.341]  This is Darwinism, but they're using it in a very... And the globalists have decided we're in a post-human era.
[02:56:58.401 --> 02:56:58.781]  Stay there.
[02:56:58.841 --> 02:57:01.263]  Do 50 more minutes, and then Will Johnson's taking over.
[02:57:01.603 --> 02:57:08.648]  We're going to go directly to Christopher, then we're going to go to Schomer.
[02:57:09.108 --> 02:57:11.430]  Stepdaughter lives in Kenya and wants to discuss Muslim religion.
[02:57:11.950 --> 02:57:18.715]  Omar in Germany, ex-Muslim, now Christian, only Islam, teratopic, and Sona in Oklahoma, female Muslim.
[02:57:19.710 --> 02:57:20.210]  Perspective.
[02:57:20.230 --> 02:57:22.251]  We're going to get to all those callers.
[02:57:23.212 --> 02:57:23.632]  And Chief.
[02:57:24.552 --> 02:57:25.393]  I was calling Chef.
[02:57:25.893 --> 02:57:27.513]  My eyes have literally just gone the last year.
[02:57:27.533 --> 02:57:28.334]  They used to be so good.
[02:57:28.354 --> 02:57:29.114]  I can't.
[02:57:29.534 --> 02:57:30.875]  The guy's got to move that board over.
[02:57:30.935 --> 02:57:31.775]  I can't read this anymore.
[02:57:31.835 --> 02:57:32.536]  I'm not mad.
[02:57:32.576 --> 02:57:34.296]  I just, like, wow.
[02:57:34.336 --> 02:57:34.897]  Hit 45.
[02:57:34.937 --> 02:57:35.457]  My eyes went.
[02:57:36.257 --> 02:57:36.557]  We're done.
[02:57:36.577 --> 02:57:38.798]  They used to be, like, my eyes used to be, like, HD.
[02:57:38.858 --> 02:57:41.900]  I could, like, see, like, ants on the ground 20 feet away.

[02:59:08.006 --> 02:59:11.328]  One of my classics, all of my books and videos are available.
[02:59:11.628 --> 02:59:12.549]  We're good to go.
[02:59:32.518 --> 02:59:37.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.172 --> 03:00:17.735]  Has the left, or Satan's forces, the left-hand path embraced Islam?
[03:00:18.696 --> 03:00:21.978]  Or is it trying to take control of it and use it for a class of civilizations?
[03:00:22.018 --> 03:00:22.739]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.139 --> 03:00:23.820]  We're into the fourth hour.
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:25.160]  Will Johnson's table in 15 minutes.
[03:00:25.621 --> 03:00:27.462]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[03:00:29.163 --> 03:00:33.566]  And we just had the fellow that was calling in.
[03:00:33.606 --> 03:00:34.487]  He wanted to disagree.
[03:00:34.527 --> 03:00:35.007]  Hang up.
[03:00:35.508 --> 03:00:36.748]  That drives me crazy.
[03:00:37.569 --> 03:00:38.950]  But I'm going to calls in order.
[03:00:41.059 --> 03:00:48.365]  So that, I understand people out there working and they're on their lunch breaks, but I was going to go to the next caller, Schmidty next, but he hung up.
[03:00:49.706 --> 03:00:55.251]  So we're going to talk to Shomer in Washington.
[03:00:55.291 --> 03:00:56.992]  You're on the air with our guest, Zachary.
[03:00:57.012 --> 03:00:57.393]  Go ahead.
[03:00:59.194 --> 03:01:01.276]  Yeah, that's Shomer, actually.
[03:01:01.316 --> 03:01:01.676]  Sorry.
[03:01:01.977 --> 03:01:02.617]  Shomer.
[03:01:03.658 --> 03:01:04.118]  Shomer.
[03:01:04.138 --> 03:01:06.060]  It's like a show horse.
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:06.701]  Say Shomer.
[03:01:07.121 --> 03:01:07.701]  Shomer.
[03:01:07.882 --> 03:01:08.342]  Now I get it.
[03:01:09.535 --> 03:01:10.055]  There you go.
[03:01:11.335 --> 03:01:20.657]  Yeah, so the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Kenya is amazing.
[03:01:21.977 --> 03:01:34.620]  And especially down in Mombasa, where it's 80% Muslim, they've lived in perfect harmony with the Christian community for hundreds of years.
[03:01:37.740 --> 03:01:40.001]  Isn't that because they're really just Kenyans?
[03:01:42.921 --> 03:01:45.462]  The left isn't sabotaging things.
[03:01:45.562 --> 03:01:48.242]  They are the Swahili tribe.
[03:01:50.563 --> 03:01:52.363]  Kenya is 44 tribes.
[03:01:54.844 --> 03:01:59.925]  And the Swahili are the Muslim tribe in Kenya.
[03:02:03.499 --> 03:02:18.571]  When Al-Shabaab came down into northern Kenya, what happened was the Muslims there, the Muslim women, they brought scarves out for all the Christian women.
[03:02:19.892 --> 03:02:23.334]  And they hid them among themselves.
[03:02:24.135 --> 03:02:25.816]  And they said, nope, there are no Christians here.
[03:02:25.836 --> 03:02:28.218]  Love this guy.
[03:02:30.708 --> 03:02:33.494]  Well sure, so you're saying there's areas where Muslims and Christians are living in peace.
[03:02:33.574 --> 03:02:35.859]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:35.919 --> 03:02:36.881]  You want to comment on that, Zach?
[03:02:38.252 --> 03:02:39.053]  Yeah, no kidding.
[03:02:39.673 --> 03:02:45.137]  That's how it should go when there's no, you know, military-industrial conflict, CIA-backed sabotage.
[03:02:45.237 --> 03:02:46.458]  That's exactly how it goes.
[03:02:46.478 --> 03:02:48.820]  That's exactly how human beings exist.
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:56.685]  There's arbitrary lines that they call borders in these countries, but what the gentleman was saying, Kenya is a beautiful example, Morocco is a beautiful example.
[03:02:57.446 --> 03:03:05.511]  When the military-industrial conflict, CIA, this sort of a globalist sort of agenda is not implemented in these countries, it's harmony.
[03:03:05.711 --> 03:03:06.632]  Would you imagine that?
[03:03:07.441 --> 03:03:08.461]  Would you imagine that?
[03:03:08.481 --> 03:03:10.562]  It's sabotage.
[03:03:10.782 --> 03:03:12.383]  It's psychological warfare.
[03:03:12.443 --> 03:03:14.504]  These people are demonic.
[03:03:15.264 --> 03:03:16.145]  We're religious.
[03:03:16.405 --> 03:03:17.685]  We cannot fight against each other.
[03:03:17.725 --> 03:03:19.406]  These are Abrahamic religions.
[03:03:19.446 --> 03:03:21.427]  I don't care if you're Jew, Christian, or Muslim.
[03:03:22.023 --> 03:03:23.284]  Listen, I'm not perfect.
[03:03:23.324 --> 03:03:26.546]  I'm outside the realm of all that now.
[03:03:26.566 --> 03:03:29.047]  I guess you could call me intellectual or Buddhist or whatever.
[03:03:29.067 --> 03:03:29.547]  I don't care.
[03:03:30.668 --> 03:03:33.270]  But I observe it and I have the timeline.
[03:03:33.330 --> 03:03:34.370]  This individual is correct.
[03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:36.952]  When it's not sabotaged, guess what?
[03:03:37.092 --> 03:03:38.192]  People happen to get along.
[03:03:38.673 --> 03:03:41.354]  Well sure, there's definitely globalist forces manipulating something.
[03:03:41.374 --> 03:03:42.015]  You're right, the AI.
[03:03:43.035 --> 03:03:44.736]  It's lowering our IQ.
[03:03:45.276 --> 03:03:46.137]  People aren't getting married.
[03:03:46.157 --> 03:03:47.077]  They're not having sex.
[03:03:47.517 --> 03:03:48.158]  They're not living.
[03:03:48.178 --> 03:03:48.918]  They're dying.
[03:03:48.978 --> 03:03:51.979]  The TVs, the smartphones are killing us.
[03:03:52.079 --> 03:03:53.000]  That's the big threat.
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:54.040]  Hold on.
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:55.421]  I mean, it's this easy.
[03:03:55.641 --> 03:03:58.022]  This is not a conspiracy.
[03:03:58.062 --> 03:03:59.703]  This is from the State Department.
[03:04:00.103 --> 03:04:02.424]  The first contact with Bin Laden was in 1979.
[03:04:04.255 --> 03:04:05.336]  They knew who he was.
[03:04:05.856 --> 03:04:06.816]  Super wealthy.
[03:04:07.177 --> 03:04:09.798]  They backed him to fight then the Soviets.
[03:04:10.558 --> 03:04:12.019]  Then they were called Mujahideen.
[03:04:12.179 --> 03:04:14.680]  Tom Hanks did a great movie called Charlie Wilson's War.
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:18.502]  And now all of a sudden they're Al Qaeda and they're these big bad people.
[03:04:18.582 --> 03:04:19.483]  And guess what?
[03:04:19.763 --> 03:04:20.603]  You know what grows there?
[03:04:20.923 --> 03:04:21.364]  Poppy.
[03:04:21.384 --> 03:04:22.464]  You know what poppy is?
[03:04:22.664 --> 03:04:23.164]  Morphine.
[03:04:23.204 --> 03:04:24.065]  You know what morphine is?
[03:04:24.285 --> 03:04:24.725]  Heroin.
[03:04:24.945 --> 03:04:27.507]  It's destroying this country and they're doing it on purpose.
[03:04:28.307 --> 03:04:32.069]  And now they're like, well listen, these Muslims are coming in and there's an invasion.
[03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:33.049]  How dare you?
[03:04:33.149 --> 03:04:35.370]  We're human beings, we know where technology's going.
[03:04:35.650 --> 03:04:37.191]  Let's just, let's fix this, man.
[03:04:37.211 --> 03:04:44.033]  Sure, I understand, but the point is the globalists are putting the bad radicals in charge and opening the gate, and then telling all of us to put up with it.
[03:04:44.053 --> 03:04:44.953]  That's why people are pissed.
[03:04:45.233 --> 03:04:49.635]  We need Muslims to point out what's happening and say it's wrong, if we're not going to have the collapse of civilizations.
[03:04:49.655 --> 03:04:53.136]  Omar in Germany, and Shona in Oklahoma.
[03:04:53.216 --> 03:04:56.077]  Jay, first up, chief in New York.
[03:04:56.737 --> 03:04:59.178]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[03:04:59.218 --> 03:05:01.179]  Tomorrow's news, today, NewsWars.
[03:05:03.746 --> 03:05:10.489]  Both President Obama and Hillary Clinton found it impossible to say the words radical Islam.
[03:05:10.829 --> 03:05:12.429]  Radical Islamic terrorists.
[03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:15.511]  And she won't even mention the word.
[03:05:15.891 --> 03:05:17.411]  And nor will President Obama.
[03:05:17.471 --> 03:05:18.432]  He won't use the term.
[03:05:18.612 --> 03:05:21.313]  Or speak anything negative about Islam.
[03:05:21.413 --> 03:05:28.856]  I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
[03:05:29.136 --> 03:05:36.578]  And now after the horrible terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, strangely, they cannot seem to use the word Christian.
[03:05:37.439 --> 03:05:48.322]  Obama, Clinton, and ABC News have all used the word Easter Worshipper, as if an anti-Christian PR firm is feeding them all talking points.
[03:05:48.842 --> 03:05:49.362]  Strange.
[03:05:49.842 --> 03:05:55.064]  At this point, it really just seems obvious what side these people are all working for.
[03:05:58.371 --> 03:05:58.952]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:58.972 --> 03:06:00.092]  Because there is a war on.
[03:06:00.112 --> 03:06:00.532]  For your mind.
[03:06:00.552 --> 03:06:00.873]  Shake it up.
[03:06:26.994 --> 03:06:28.657]  Shake it up!
[03:06:28.917 --> 03:06:36.509]  We're definitely shaking the show up.
[03:06:36.549 --> 03:06:40.395]  I'm not just going to sit here and bash Muslims all day and say they're the sorts of evil on this planet.
[03:06:41.215 --> 03:06:46.039]  I'm just telling you, the globalists are radicalizing it, they're using it, and the media covers up for it.
[03:06:46.059 --> 03:06:52.443]  There's a powerful Paul Watson report up on Infowars.com, the truth about the Sri Lanka attack that Will Johnson's taken over.
[03:06:52.863 --> 03:06:56.626]  Always load it for bear than in about 45 minutes or a little bit longer, about 50-something minutes.
[03:06:57.407 --> 03:07:01.710]  We're going to have, of course, Owen Schroeder take over with the war room.
[03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:05.292]  Please tune into that on your local stations and spread the word however you can.
[03:07:05.372 --> 03:07:06.533]  You are the voice of Infowars.
[03:07:06.553 --> 03:07:07.454]  Without you, we're screwed.
[03:07:07.494 --> 03:07:08.895]  So thank you all for what you do.
[03:07:08.935 --> 03:07:10.036]  I really appreciate you out there.
[03:07:11.550 --> 03:07:12.610]  Hey, what's going on, guys?
[03:07:13.290 --> 03:07:17.331]  I just want to say, like, I don't hate you for being a Christian or whatever.
[03:07:17.351 --> 03:07:17.511]  Fine.
[03:07:17.571 --> 03:07:19.051]  But don't sit there and act like
[03:07:42.556 --> 03:07:47.919]  Like, the whole world is wrong when a church gets blown up because of what happened to our longhouses.
[03:07:48.259 --> 03:07:55.042]  How do you think our people felt when we were chased from our homelands and all the enslavement that went on?
[03:07:55.062 --> 03:07:56.723]  I mean, you can't deny that, bro.
[03:07:56.843 --> 03:07:57.283]  You can't.
[03:07:57.903 --> 03:08:00.344]  And listen, we're not perfect either.
[03:08:00.905 --> 03:08:07.448]  But for you guys to sit there and complain about churches being blown up, don't sit there
[03:08:08.766 --> 03:08:11.087]  Not act like we didn't have stuff done to us.
[03:08:11.127 --> 03:08:12.948]  Chief, here's the deal.
[03:08:13.128 --> 03:08:14.048]  Here's the deal, Chief.
[03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:16.589]  I 100% agree with you.
[03:08:17.490 --> 03:08:30.916]  And when that church, Christchurch, had that attack on that mosque and killed 49 people, I said it was horrible, it was terrible, and everybody put on hijabs and, you know, we're all guilty.
[03:08:30.956 --> 03:08:35.798]  I said, no, don't say all Westerners are guilty, but just say that's not a nice thing to do and it's wrong.
[03:08:36.940 --> 03:08:40.021]  Then Christians get blown up, and Obama and Hillary won't even call them Christians.
[03:08:40.541 --> 03:08:42.181]  They call them Easter worshippers.
[03:08:42.261 --> 03:08:45.282]  So, you said you're not without sin either.
[03:08:46.522 --> 03:08:48.483]  You're not to blame for what your ancestors did.
[03:08:48.943 --> 03:08:49.823]  People showed up here.
[03:08:50.523 --> 03:08:52.884]  One tribe would try to get you to fight the other tribe.
[03:08:53.384 --> 03:09:00.746]  They got tribal stuff, just like the whites, you know, were fighting each other against the French and the English.
[03:09:00.806 --> 03:09:03.686]  I mean, humans are humans, as Zach was saying.
[03:09:03.706 --> 03:09:05.367]  But no, I totally get your point that
[03:09:06.175 --> 03:09:10.498]  You know, you had the British handing out smallpox blankets to the Native American women and children.
[03:09:10.598 --> 03:09:11.238]  I wouldn't do that.
[03:09:11.758 --> 03:09:22.444]  So some really barbarous, evil, sneaky stuff was done by the West that Native Americans, culture-wide, would fight you and try to kill you, but they wouldn't give you disease on purpose.
[03:09:22.464 --> 03:09:25.326]  They thought that was bad luck and sneaky and pissant.
[03:09:25.846 --> 03:09:29.368]  So I would say, in some ways, the West was more low-down than Native Americans.
[03:09:29.388 --> 03:09:29.989]  It's actually true.
[03:09:30.049 --> 03:09:32.590]  And I'm a little bit Native American, me, so I don't sit there and judge that.
[03:09:32.610 --> 03:09:33.371]  I don't see it as a
[03:09:34.982 --> 03:09:48.289]  I'm not a socialist either, and I don't like that.
[03:09:48.669 --> 03:09:53.932]  But I think we as Natives, because we're the first people here, I think we should get some stuff for free.
[03:09:54.212 --> 03:09:54.912]  Not everything.
[03:09:55.213 --> 03:09:58.374]  But anytime you get stuff for free, it domesticates anybody.
[03:09:58.754 --> 03:10:01.456]  If you said, I want a claim to National Parks or something,
[03:10:02.136 --> 03:10:03.838]  And it wasn't some tribal council that got it.
[03:10:03.878 --> 03:10:12.027]  I wouldn't be against individual people, like, say, you know, 30% or something native blood would get a piece of a national park or something.
[03:10:12.628 --> 03:10:20.237]  I mean, I think you could say that, but I think just saying, oh, we're going to have tribal managers giving you stuff, that creates the horrible nightmares that we see on reservations.
[03:10:20.657 --> 03:10:21.158]  God bless you.
[03:10:21.178 --> 03:10:21.819]  I appreciate your call.
[03:10:23.342 --> 03:10:25.643]  Just like you domesticate humans, just like you domesticate animals.
[03:10:25.683 --> 03:10:27.204]  Why don't you feed animals at the park?
[03:10:27.344 --> 03:10:28.445]  It makes them domesticated.
[03:10:28.985 --> 03:10:29.966]  You don't want to do it.
[03:10:30.406 --> 03:10:32.307]  Humans need to work for what they get.
[03:10:32.847 --> 03:10:35.428]  What's been done to what's left of Native Americans is scary.
[03:10:35.769 --> 03:10:37.289]  Been out to reservations out west, man.
[03:10:37.509 --> 03:10:37.990]  It's scary.
[03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:40.671]  And you learn what amount of money they're getting.
[03:10:40.731 --> 03:10:41.972]  It's like, wow, what happened here?
[03:10:41.992 --> 03:10:43.573]  It's all just really sad.
[03:10:44.373 --> 03:10:45.234]  You want to say anything, Zach?
[03:10:46.334 --> 03:10:47.135]  Yeah.
[03:10:47.275 --> 03:10:48.355]  Chief, hey, brother.
[03:10:49.296 --> 03:10:51.717]  And I'm going to say this, from Chief Tecumseh.
[03:10:52.563 --> 03:10:55.604]  So live your life, that the fear of death can never enter your heart.
[03:10:56.245 --> 03:10:58.385]  Let's take some more calls here.
[03:11:00.006 --> 03:11:04.888]  Let's talk to Omar in Germany, former Muslim, now Christian on the Islam Terra topic.
[03:11:05.208 --> 03:11:07.990]  Go ahead Omar, you're on the air.
[03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:14.432]  Hey Alex, big fan over here, like me and my friends, we just wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
[03:11:15.353 --> 03:11:20.775]  I wanted to ask you, what do you think about the fact that there are forces corrupting religions, not just
[03:11:21.614 --> 03:11:29.216]  Not just, let's say, Islam, with all the destabilization, all the secular leaders like Gaddafi, what's he called?
[03:11:29.236 --> 03:11:29.797]  Saddam.
[03:11:30.917 --> 03:11:34.358]  Assad, and them, yeah.
[03:11:34.898 --> 03:11:42.680]  And what do you think about the fact that, for instance, Judaism was also somehow hijacked with the Talmud and this fake Jewish supremacy, you know?
[03:11:42.700 --> 03:11:46.421]  Well, there's no doubt that people go, why are there all these different Jewish groups?
[03:11:46.441 --> 03:11:47.962]  Well, you've got the Old Testament.
[03:11:49.244 --> 03:11:56.507]  And then you've got all these different things that have been written by different rabbinical groups that are very different ideas.
[03:11:56.868 --> 03:12:00.349]  So yeah, it's definitely a mess.
[03:12:03.330 --> 03:12:05.912]  I was just wondering, how do we overcome this fact?
[03:12:05.952 --> 03:12:14.936]  Because by virtue of you destroying all of these religions, by destroying pious people... Omar, I did not hang up on you.
[03:12:14.956 --> 03:12:15.256]  Are you there?
[03:12:20.873 --> 03:12:22.274]  By destroying religious people.
[03:12:22.554 --> 03:12:25.757]  How do we deal with, you know, this corruption in religion in general?
[03:12:25.797 --> 03:12:26.597]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:12:26.717 --> 03:12:31.920]  The globalists want to get rid of people that care about the spiritual because they want to control us and the spiritual is the next level.
[03:12:32.481 --> 03:12:33.601]  And I think that is the big debate.
[03:12:33.662 --> 03:12:35.823]  It's a whole other hour show, three hour show.
[03:12:36.323 --> 03:12:39.525]  What do you do to transcend the attack on real spirituality?
[03:12:40.066 --> 03:12:41.066]  I appreciate your call.
[03:12:41.867 --> 03:12:43.228]  Let's talk to Shona.
[03:12:44.068 --> 03:12:46.350]  In Oklahoma, female Muslim perspective.
[03:12:46.371 --> 03:12:47.191]  Go ahead, Shona.
[03:12:47.492 --> 03:12:48.232]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:48.913 --> 03:12:50.475]  Hi, my name is Sana.
[03:12:51.035 --> 03:12:52.817]  Sana, go ahead.
[03:12:53.237 --> 03:13:02.827]  Well, I want to start off by saying Muslims, Christians, Jews, we all know that there's one true God.
[03:13:03.027 --> 03:13:05.029]  We all worship the same God.
[03:13:05.570 --> 03:13:06.871]  You know, for Muslims,
[03:13:07.327 --> 03:13:10.049]  In Arabic, the word Allah means God.
[03:13:10.289 --> 03:13:16.374]  Therefore, when somebody says, oh, you guys believe in Allah, not the one true God, Allah means God.
[03:13:16.794 --> 03:13:19.256]  I just want to clarify that.
[03:13:19.276 --> 03:13:28.863]  And when I'm talking about terrorism, how, I guess, one of the callers said that Islam was based on violence, and it's always been violence.
[03:13:28.984 --> 03:13:36.049]  There's a story I want to tell you that I heard from one of my friends who did Alam, of course, means she learned about Islam so much.
[03:13:36.537 --> 03:13:37.478]  She told me this story.
[03:13:37.858 --> 03:13:40.440]  It's about the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam.
[03:13:41.360 --> 03:13:49.646]  There was a time where war was inflicted with him and his people, and they were at war against a group of people.
[03:13:49.726 --> 03:13:50.927]  I do not remember who that was.
[03:13:51.628 --> 03:13:54.810]  And I remember the Prophet was hurt really bad.
[03:13:54.910 --> 03:14:00.534]  He was struck on top of his head, and I guess blood was streaming down his face.
[03:14:01.090 --> 03:14:06.474]  And Islamists believe that the Prophet was the favorite Prophet of God.
[03:14:06.494 --> 03:14:15.920]  So, he declared if a drop of blood was to drop, the Prophet's drop of blood was to drop on that land, he will kill everybody on that land.
[03:14:15.980 --> 03:14:17.141]  He will destroy the land.
[03:14:17.201 --> 03:14:22.205]  He will literally tear it apart if his Prophet's blood was to splatter on that earth.
[03:14:22.665 --> 03:14:24.026]  But you know what the Prophet did?
[03:14:24.466 --> 03:14:29.590]  He took his hand, he cupped it on his face to make sure no blood would drop on that land.
[03:14:30.208 --> 03:14:35.810]  It wasn't to protect just the Muslims who are fighting in the war, but it was to protect everybody else.
[03:14:36.271 --> 03:14:41.033]  If Islam was all about terrorism, all about violence, why would the... Sure, no, I understand.
[03:14:41.053 --> 03:14:46.755]  Well, there's also when you conquer somebody, then you do the little gracious thing to look like, you know, it's okay, you've been defeated, but I hear what you're saying.
[03:14:47.035 --> 03:14:48.296]  Real quick, Jay in New York.
[03:14:48.816 --> 03:14:50.597]  Jay, currently practicing Muslim.
[03:14:50.637 --> 03:14:51.377]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:14:51.397 --> 03:14:55.099]  Hi, I agree with Erwan who said that the hit piece
[03:14:55.983 --> 03:15:02.047]  I'm not trying to get people to my side.
[03:15:02.087 --> 03:15:03.568]  We're putting out stuff here.
[03:15:04.689 --> 03:15:07.171]  No, I think you should try and do more like a mexit.
[03:15:08.352 --> 03:15:10.013]  Like what Candace Owens is doing.
[03:15:12.294 --> 03:15:22.261]  And try to convince people to, uh, try to convince people to, uh, join, not join you, but join the InfoWars.
[03:15:26.305 --> 03:15:26.946]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:15:28.267 --> 03:15:32.150]  There's all this leftist apology for Islamic attacks, and they won't even say they're Islamic attacks.
[03:15:32.190 --> 03:15:34.131]  We're trying to bring a real debate to this, but I appreciate you.
[03:15:34.151 --> 03:15:35.012]  I appreciate Zach.
[03:15:35.472 --> 03:15:36.053]  I appreciate you.
[03:15:36.073 --> 03:15:44.419]  I don't want to just have you on for 10 seconds, but I've got to end this because we've got Will Johnson loaded for bear about to take over, and I'm going to air Paul Watson's new piece that just came out.
[03:15:45.347 --> 03:15:55.350]  Here on air when we come back and then Will Johnson will take over, UnitedAmericaFirst.com, we're going to air this piece, the truth about the Sri Lanka attacks, straight ahead, because you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:15:56.030 --> 03:16:00.131]  Islam is expansionist, it's taking over, and we need to talk about it.
[03:16:06.955 --> 03:16:10.879]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[03:16:11.319 --> 03:16:13.120]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:16:13.221 --> 03:16:13.921]  Good to talk to you.
[03:16:14.261 --> 03:16:18.445]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:16:18.665 --> 03:16:20.407]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[03:16:20.507 --> 03:16:24.891]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:16:25.111 --> 03:16:27.012]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[03:16:27.072 --> 03:16:31.436]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[03:16:31.516 --> 03:16:32.978]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:16:33.038 --> 03:16:33.518]  Tell us about it.
[03:16:33.578 --> 03:16:34.278]  Well, it's really great.
[03:16:34.318 --> 03:16:35.499]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:16:35.539 --> 03:16:35.979]  I take it.
[03:16:36.039 --> 03:16:36.659]  It tastes good.
[03:16:36.719 --> 03:16:38.420]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:40.180]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:42.761]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[03:16:42.821 --> 03:16:43.622]  So I really like it.
[03:16:43.642 --> 03:16:46.323]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:16:46.363 --> 03:16:47.903]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:16:48.023 --> 03:16:49.884]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:16:50.004 --> 03:16:50.484]  So, yeah.
[03:16:50.864 --> 03:16:52.725]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:16:53.185 --> 03:16:55.526]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[03:16:55.886 --> 03:16:56.786]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[03:19:05.698 --> 03:19:09.100]  If you're a new Lester, just type in Pentagon-tested gay bomb on Iraq.
[03:19:09.420 --> 03:19:11.201]  They considered, no, they didn't consider using it.
[03:19:11.381 --> 03:19:12.602]  They've used it on our troops.
[03:19:12.962 --> 03:19:15.223]  In Vietnam, they'd spray PCP on the troops.
[03:19:15.263 --> 03:19:16.024]  Jacob's Ladder.
[03:19:17.044 --> 03:19:20.526]  You think PCP, some horse tranquilizer something?
[03:19:22.179 --> 03:19:23.620]  What do you think tap water is?
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:24.841]  It's a gay bomb, baby!
[03:19:24.901 --> 03:19:27.904]  And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings.
[03:19:28.004 --> 03:19:29.625]  I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly.
[03:19:29.646 --> 03:19:30.566]  I mean, give me a break!
[03:19:46.865 --> 03:19:49.287]  Some up here bashing it because I don't like gay people.
[03:19:49.587 --> 03:19:53.629]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[03:20:06.256 --> 03:20:08.858]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.764 --> 03:20:23.810]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:28.098 --> 03:20:37.823]  Islamic terrorists attacked a number of luxury hotels and Catholic churches in Sri Lanka, killing 290 people and injuring 500 more.
[03:20:37.923 --> 03:20:41.845]  Why did Hillary Clinton react to the Christchurch mosque massacre?
[03:20:42.085 --> 03:20:48.609]  By specifically offering condolences to the Muslim community and calling out Islamophobia.
[03:20:48.689 --> 03:20:53.091]  Yet when it came to offering condolences to the scores of Catholics killed in Sri Lanka,
[03:20:53.311 --> 03:21:00.596]  She specifically avoided using the term Christians, instead calling them Easter worshippers.
[03:21:00.736 --> 03:21:04.658]  Why did Barack Obama react to the Christchurch mosque massacre?
[03:21:04.698 --> 03:21:08.341]  By specifically offering condolences to the Muslim community.
[03:21:08.421 --> 03:21:13.224]  Yet when it came to offering condolences to the scores of Catholics killed in Sri Lanka,
[03:21:13.584 --> 03:21:15.825]  Why is there such a reticence to use the C word?
[03:21:15.885 --> 03:21:21.307]  Why was CNN more miffed about Trump's tweet typo than Obama and Hillary refusing to use the word Christians?
[03:21:41.277 --> 03:21:43.398]  He left the tweet up for more than 20 minutes.
[03:21:43.518 --> 03:21:54.904]  Why does the most persecuted religious group in the world receive the least sympathy from world leaders and the media after each devastating attack?
[03:21:54.924 --> 03:21:59.147]  105 Christian churches or buildings are attacked or burned every month.
[03:21:59.447 --> 03:22:06.851]  An average of 345 Christians are killed for faith-related reasons every single month.
[03:22:07.031 --> 03:22:12.635]  The Sri Lanka attacks killed nearly six times as many people as the Christchurch mosque massacre.
[03:22:12.675 --> 03:22:14.997]  And this isn't some kind of grisly competition.
[03:22:15.097 --> 03:22:16.758]  Both attacks were horrendous.
[03:22:16.958 --> 03:22:23.603]  But are we going to see world leaders donning crucifixes and making special speeches in support of the Christian community?
[03:22:23.743 --> 03:22:30.488]  Or will this entire story be forgotten about by the media and by much of the world within 48 hours?
[03:22:30.628 --> 03:22:34.411]  Will all those liberals who poured out their soul after the New Zealand mosque attack
[03:22:34.531 --> 03:22:42.077]  Now change their flags in solidarity with Sri Lankan Christian community, hold fundraisers and condemn Islamists who carried out this attack.
[03:22:42.117 --> 03:22:49.202]  Why do some leftists, who collectively blame all white people or all conservatives after every anti-Muslim attack,
[03:22:49.582 --> 03:22:55.303]  Is not to denounce Islamic terror attacks, but when they occur, to blame the victims.
[03:22:55.483 --> 03:23:03.885]  This left-wing journalist responded to a barbaric Islamic terror attack which targeted Christians by blaming Christian missionaries.
[03:23:04.005 --> 03:23:12.627]  Have we now reached the stage where the fault lies not with the Islamic terrorist who blew himself up, but with the people who may have offended him.
[03:23:12.827 --> 03:23:17.628]  In what kind of messed up clown world does that kind of rhetoric make any sense?
[03:23:17.788 --> 03:23:24.473]  Why did CBS News report the perpetrators as religious extremists and not Muslim extremists?
[03:23:24.613 --> 03:23:31.658]  Why did it take the media over a day to report the patently obvious that this was an Islamic terror attack?
[03:23:31.718 --> 03:23:36.582]  Why did the Sri Lankan government demand that its people not even ask who was behind the attacks?
[03:23:36.662 --> 03:23:38.203]  Do they not deserve to know?
[03:23:38.343 --> 03:23:47.170]  Why does the Western media routinely hype the threat posed by right-wing extremism, yet routinely downplay the threat posed by Islamic extremism?
[03:23:47.230 --> 03:23:51.354]  When the threat posed by Islamic extremism is clearly far greater.
[03:23:51.514 --> 03:23:57.659]  One of the alleged suicide bombers in Sri Lanka has been identified as Islamic extremist Zahran Hashim.
[03:23:57.839 --> 03:24:04.525]  He previously posted a video in which he stated that quote, anyone who disagrees with Muslims should be killed.
[03:24:04.725 --> 03:24:14.194]  Why was this video allowed to circulate by YouTube which routinely removes or restricts conservative content for little more than being politically incorrect?
[03:24:14.414 --> 03:24:21.419]  Why did Al Jazeera journalist Saif Khalid claim that reporting Hashim's name was Islamophobic?
[03:24:21.639 --> 03:24:27.923]  Is it now Islamophobic to accurately state that the suicide bombers in Sri Lanka were Muslims?
[03:24:28.143 --> 03:24:33.987]  Imagine if Christians targeted mosques during Ramadan and tried to kill as many Muslims as possible.
[03:24:34.087 --> 03:24:39.451]  There'd be a global outcry, there'd be weeks of mourning, there'd be permanent recriminations.
[03:24:39.571 --> 03:24:47.097]  Sri Lanka, nearly 300 dead, 500 injured, and by the end of this week, it will be a footnote.
[03:24:48.158 --> 03:24:48.458]  Why?
[03:25:01.943 --> 03:25:04.384]  Please click the big red button to subscribe.
[03:25:04.424 --> 03:25:06.065]  It really helps me when you do that.
[03:25:06.165 --> 03:25:06.525]  All right.
[03:25:07.025 --> 03:25:08.406]  Hello, my name is Will Johnson.
[03:25:08.426 --> 03:25:12.148]  I am sitting in for Alex Jones for the remainder of this hour.
[03:25:12.928 --> 03:25:13.969]  Thank you for sticking around.
[03:25:14.009 --> 03:25:20.832]  We're going to continue with the phone lines, but first I just want to talk a little bit about what's happening in the world and with everything that's been going on.
[03:25:21.352 --> 03:25:24.894]  And everyone is glued to the tube to watch it except for the liberal media.
[03:25:25.615 --> 03:25:32.379]  One thing I noticed is on the liberal media, and I watch the Communist News Network just to see what they're talking about, just to see what they're saying.
[03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:42.205]  And sure enough, they did talk about what happened in Sri Lanka, just to see what was happening, you know, to make it look like they're reporting on the news.
[03:25:42.685 --> 03:25:44.587]  But then they dropped it.
[03:25:45.007 --> 03:25:46.828]  You know what happened in New Zealand?
[03:25:47.606 --> 03:25:52.449]  They were talking about what happened in New Zealand 24-7, day in and day out.
[03:25:52.509 --> 03:26:04.735]  They would not give it a rest because they wanted to make it look like some kind of way President Trump was involved or as President Trump may have influenced this monster to go into this mosque to kill these people.
[03:26:05.732 --> 03:26:14.796]  But the Communist News Network, they talked about a little bit, but then they moved back over to the whole collusion delusion with the Mueller report.
[03:26:15.156 --> 03:26:24.180]  See, most of the time, if there's something that happens, if an event takes place, what they will do is they will drill it down, drill it down.
[03:26:24.220 --> 03:26:33.043]  But if it's something that they don't like, they will make sure they bring back to the surface the subject that they want people to think about.
[03:26:33.744 --> 03:26:34.704]  What's more important?
[03:26:35.732 --> 03:26:42.801]  Over 300 people dying versus a report that should have never taken place?
[03:26:44.002 --> 03:26:45.144]  What is more important?
[03:26:45.965 --> 03:26:50.070]  What should the liberal media should be talking about more than any other?
[03:26:51.087 --> 03:26:55.909]  And the Communist News Network, they're okay with not talking about it the way they should.
[03:26:56.390 --> 03:27:01.192]  See, they don't want people to realize that Christians across the world are being persecuted.
[03:27:01.652 --> 03:27:03.653]  They don't want people to realize that.
[03:27:04.193 --> 03:27:11.057]  And if it was the other way around, for example, like New Zealand, like I just mentioned, they would be talking about it 24-7.
[03:27:11.077 --> 03:27:11.737]  It's really a no-brainer.
[03:27:15.037 --> 03:27:24.228]  But they find it more important to try to take out the President of the United States than it is to address the issues about Christians being attacked across the planet.
[03:27:25.730 --> 03:27:26.771]  It is a horrible time.
[03:27:27.272 --> 03:27:29.174]  We are living in the end times.
[03:27:30.402 --> 03:27:31.884]  We are living in the end times.
[03:27:32.024 --> 03:27:35.589]  You don't hear a lot of people, especially in the mainstream media, talk about that.
[03:27:36.089 --> 03:27:42.497]  But all these different events taking place, and you have people in the past, they always say, well, you know, we've always had these things take place.
[03:27:43.078 --> 03:27:44.720]  Of course, we've had violence.
[03:27:45.301 --> 03:27:48.645]  But it's never been a time like it is now.
[03:27:49.867 --> 03:27:56.513]  Where we have the earthquakes and we have the changing of minds of little children to believe something else.
[03:27:56.813 --> 03:28:03.539]  Where we have people believing that they can be something simply because they feel that way.
[03:28:03.899 --> 03:28:09.604]  Or they're pushing this whole agenda on the rest of us that demonizes us if we don't believe what they believe.
[03:28:09.945 --> 03:28:13.168]  It's not like it's ever been before.
[03:28:13.488 --> 03:28:15.670]  And what's happening over in the Middle East,
[03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:17.811]  And happening in these other countries.
[03:28:18.132 --> 03:28:24.457]  It should be a wake-up call to everybody that we are living in a time like no other time before.
[03:28:26.018 --> 03:28:27.079]  We've got to wake up.
[03:28:28.720 --> 03:28:29.801]  We've got to wake up.
[03:28:30.882 --> 03:28:34.845]  Now, one thing I want to talk about before we go to this break, when we come back.
[03:28:35.365 --> 03:28:37.107]  The Survival Shield X2.
[03:28:37.987 --> 03:28:39.789]  This is so wonderful.
[03:28:40.501 --> 03:28:45.582]  The only reason why I'm bringing it up, because it is absolutely remarkable what this product does.
[03:28:45.902 --> 03:28:49.023]  I'm going to talk a little bit more about it on the other side of the break.
[03:28:49.904 --> 03:28:53.925]  My name is Will Johnson, sitting in for Alex Jones, and this is the Info Wars.
[03:29:04.591 --> 03:29:12.393]  Hey, what happens if you try to order your favorite InfoWars Life product only to find out they're sold out?
[03:29:12.413 --> 03:29:16.375]  Yeah, I know it kind of sucks, but there is a solution.

[03:29:21.816 --> 03:29:22.156]  Bam!

[03:29:27.858 --> 03:29:34.160]  That means no more back orders and you'll never run out of your favorite InfoWars Life products
[03:29:34.460 --> 03:29:34.820]  Again.
[03:29:35.180 --> 03:29:35.620]  Pretty cool.
[03:29:35.900 --> 03:29:36.500]  But guess what?
[03:29:36.781 --> 03:29:37.501]  It gets better.

[03:29:46.363 --> 03:29:46.763]  Woo!
[03:29:46.943 --> 03:29:47.963]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:29:47.983 --> 03:29:49.583]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:29:49.963 --> 03:29:51.684]  Support the InfoWars.

[03:30:02.541 --> 03:30:05.522]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:30:05.902 --> 03:30:11.805]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:30:12.225 --> 03:30:18.128]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:30:18.408 --> 03:30:21.049]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:30:21.329 --> 03:30:28.832]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:30:28.852 --> 03:30:37.056]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[03:30:37.656 --> 03:30:41.918]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[03:30:42.794 --> 03:30:46.416]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:30:46.596 --> 03:30:52.578]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[03:30:53.519 --> 03:31:02.403]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[03:31:02.923 --> 03:31:07.105]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[03:31:07.145 --> 03:31:08.906]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[03:31:09.957 --> 03:31:11.783]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[03:31:11.803 --> 03:31:13.108]  It was the last run.
[03:31:13.128 --> 03:31:14.071]  It's been sold out for two months.
[03:31:15.165 --> 03:31:16.006]  How is X2 back?
[03:31:16.526 --> 03:31:20.128]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[03:31:20.609 --> 03:31:23.671]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get any more.
[03:31:24.271 --> 03:31:34.298]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[03:31:34.358 --> 03:31:38.301]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[03:31:38.721 --> 03:31:39.842]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[03:31:40.282 --> 03:31:44.624]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[03:31:45.085 --> 03:31:46.866]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[03:31:47.286 --> 03:31:48.587]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[03:31:49.127 --> 03:31:51.388]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[03:31:51.868 --> 03:31:54.190]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[03:31:54.810 --> 03:31:58.312]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[03:31:59.152 --> 03:32:01.594]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[03:32:02.640 --> 03:32:04.962]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[03:32:05.422 --> 03:32:17.790]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[03:32:18.291 --> 03:32:20.792]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[03:32:21.373 --> 03:32:22.513]  So iodine is amazing.
[03:32:22.553 --> 03:32:23.114]  It's important.
[03:32:23.134 --> 03:32:25.375]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[03:32:25.435 --> 03:32:25.956]  They'll hurt you.
[03:32:26.336 --> 03:32:27.036]  This is pure.
[03:32:27.297 --> 03:32:28.017]  This is clean.
[03:32:28.357 --> 03:32:29.138]  This is amazing.
[03:32:29.458 --> 03:32:31.259]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[03:32:32.780 --> 03:32:36.423]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[03:32:36.743 --> 03:32:41.487]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[03:32:41.887 --> 03:32:48.412]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:48.473 --> 03:32:51.415]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[03:32:51.695 --> 03:33:00.482]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:33:00.522 --> 03:33:01.463]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:33:06.216 --> 03:33:24.731]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.911 --> 03:33:28.634]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:33:28.974 --> 03:33:35.259]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Will Johnson.
[03:33:38.556 --> 03:33:39.217]  Welcome back.
[03:33:39.257 --> 03:33:41.139]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.400 --> 03:33:44.543]  Alright, the phone lines will be open.
[03:33:44.563 --> 03:33:45.604]  Let me give out the number.
[03:33:45.864 --> 03:33:48.848]  It is 877-789-2539.
[03:33:49.388 --> 03:33:56.957]  If you want to call in and talk about what's happening throughout the world with Christianity,
[03:33:58.886 --> 03:33:59.446]  I'm not sure.
[03:33:59.486 --> 03:34:02.088]  I mean, even I guess we can even talk about the Mueller report.
[03:34:02.168 --> 03:34:06.850]  But, you know, there was nothing there that that funeral should be over with.
[03:34:07.051 --> 03:34:09.492]  But let me say this right before we start taking phone calls.
[03:34:10.933 --> 03:34:13.954]  I started taking the survival shield X2.
[03:34:14.955 --> 03:34:17.416]  And this is not anything scripted or anything.
[03:34:17.456 --> 03:34:20.298]  This is my personal experience with taking it.
[03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:30.315]  One of the things that I realized taking this was how much energy it actually gave me and how it made me feel after taking it.
[03:34:30.455 --> 03:34:32.837]  It's almost, it's remarkable.
[03:34:32.857 --> 03:34:37.260]  It's amazing how you can put so much happiness in a small bottle.
[03:34:37.280 --> 03:34:38.721]  That's the only way I can describe it.
[03:34:39.461 --> 03:34:43.504]  I mean, it's almost, it's like happiness in a bottle.
[03:34:44.184 --> 03:34:49.368]  And now I understand why it sold out before and why it was so hard to get.
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:51.160]  X2.
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:52.880]  I mean, this is remarkable.
[03:34:53.501 --> 03:34:58.862]  I mean, I can't really believe exactly how he did it and how they got it in the bottle like that.
[03:34:58.902 --> 03:34:59.262]  But OK.
[03:34:59.722 --> 03:35:02.903]  But anyways, I just had to talk about it because it's wonderful.
[03:35:02.983 --> 03:35:04.123]  It is a wonderful product.
[03:35:04.183 --> 03:35:06.423]  This, you know, from the heart is a wonderful product.
[03:35:06.543 --> 03:35:09.264]  OK, so the phone line is open if you want to call in.
[03:35:09.284 --> 03:35:14.285]  We're going to take some phone calls about what's happening for the remainder of the hour.
[03:35:15.439 --> 03:35:19.741]  I was going to show some clips, but I really want to get what people have to say about everything.
[03:35:20.021 --> 03:35:21.381]  Let me read this to you real quick.
[03:35:21.522 --> 03:35:28.965]  One thing that I was looking at, and I truly believe, like I was saying before we went to the break, that we are in the end times.
[03:35:29.605 --> 03:35:31.986]  And it was told that this was going to happen.
[03:35:32.746 --> 03:35:33.806]  So let me show you this.
[03:35:34.787 --> 03:35:44.931]  Jesus said, then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
[03:35:46.118 --> 03:35:54.001]  And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another.
[03:35:54.621 --> 03:35:58.542]  Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.
[03:35:59.343 --> 03:36:08.406]  And because lawlessness will abound, and love for many, love of many will grow cold.
[03:36:10.207 --> 03:36:13.748]  That's exactly, exactly
[03:36:15.612 --> 03:36:18.754]  Why I say we're in the end times because we're experiencing this right now.
[03:36:19.535 --> 03:36:21.156]  We're seeing this right now.
[03:36:23.338 --> 03:36:31.023]  You know, I saw another report where 11 people, 11 Christians a day are being killed because they believe in Christ throughout the world.
[03:36:31.043 --> 03:36:32.304]  11 a day!
[03:36:32.324 --> 03:36:38.109]  That's over 4,000 people a year simply because of your beliefs in Christ.
[03:36:39.470 --> 03:36:41.251]  But the liberal media doesn't want to talk about that.
[03:36:42.924 --> 03:36:46.025]  All right, so let's go with, I believe that's Janine.
[03:36:46.985 --> 03:36:48.106]  Janine from California.
[03:36:48.926 --> 03:36:50.666]  Want to talk about Christianity?
[03:36:50.686 --> 03:36:54.548]  Yeah, I just have a message for your viewers.
[03:36:55.388 --> 03:37:00.049]  I just wanted to let you know that, you know, Christ the Redeemer has returned.
[03:37:00.489 --> 03:37:03.790]  And I saw him in a vision on Friday afternoon, on Good Friday.
[03:37:03.810 --> 03:37:05.751]  He was wearing his crown of thorns.
[03:37:06.731 --> 03:37:08.892]  And then he returned back to me on Sunday.
[03:37:10.987 --> 03:37:21.575]  Yeah, I'm completely with you.
[03:37:21.635 --> 03:37:23.336]  You're, you're, you're breaking up there.
[03:37:23.356 --> 03:37:26.199]  You might want to call back in with a better reception, but you know what?
[03:37:26.799 --> 03:37:29.341]  Jesus, Jesus is, is coming back.
[03:37:29.361 --> 03:37:30.522]  I truly believe that.
[03:37:30.642 --> 03:37:34.805]  And everything that we see happening, going on in the world, there's no way around it.
[03:37:35.265 --> 03:37:38.588]  I mean, either I like to say this, either the Bible
[03:37:39.409 --> 03:37:43.873]  Is a script and people are using it to follow it or it's true?
[03:37:44.573 --> 03:37:45.394]  It's one or the other.
[03:37:46.215 --> 03:37:50.999]  Because the thing, the events that's supposed to take place in the Bible is actually happening right now.
[03:37:51.579 --> 03:37:53.621]  All right, let's go with Brandon from Texas.
[03:37:54.762 --> 03:37:56.063]  Talking about the Easter bombing.
[03:37:57.564 --> 03:37:58.164]  How's it going, Brandon?
[03:37:58.925 --> 03:37:59.726]  Hey, Will, can you hear me?
[03:38:00.326 --> 03:38:00.826]  Yes, sir.
[03:38:01.667 --> 03:38:01.987]  Awesome.
[03:38:02.047 --> 03:38:08.813]  Hey, I just wanted to first off, I want to say Alpha Power, take the thing, take it every day and I feel alive and great.
[03:38:09.454 --> 03:38:27.957]  But also, I'm a Christian, I live in Texas right now, and when you first signed on, you were talking about how the liberal media was attributing the Christchurch shooting to Donald Trump and his rhetoric and everything.
[03:38:28.257 --> 03:38:34.918]  What do you think about maybe Ilhan Omar's rhetoric or Rashida Tlaib's rhetoric?
[03:38:34.998 --> 03:38:38.819]  I mean, I don't like playing the blame game here, and I think it's a very dangerous game to play.
[03:38:39.778 --> 03:38:46.983]  But I mean, Donald Trump's rhetoric isn't exactly as radical, I would say.
[03:38:48.383 --> 03:38:52.726]  Well, you know, they like to say that Donald Trump's rhetoric is because he's putting the American people first.
[03:38:53.727 --> 03:39:00.411]  And when you have Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, they basically are anti-Semitic and
[03:39:01.380 --> 03:39:10.468]  Well, I believe it was Ilhan Omar just actually put a tweet out there saying, you know, you know, goodwill to people who said celebrating the Easter weekend, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:39:10.488 --> 03:39:12.710]  And I think personally, she was just pandering.
[03:39:13.250 --> 03:39:20.296]  And, you know, Muslims are called to lie to people just to make people believe that they are good in a certain sense.
[03:39:20.376 --> 03:39:20.597]  Right.
[03:39:20.937 --> 03:39:23.339]  So I don't I don't believe anything that they're saying.
[03:39:25.453 --> 03:39:29.475]  They've got the four different lies that they can tell on the Islamic religion.
[03:39:29.535 --> 03:39:35.597]  I don't remember exactly what they were, but you know, one of them is to kind of preserve the Islamic belief.
[03:39:36.077 --> 03:39:37.058]  Man, it's just crazy.
[03:39:37.918 --> 03:39:39.119]  Yeah, they're called to do it.
[03:39:39.759 --> 03:39:41.340]  They're called to do it, and you know what?
[03:39:41.420 --> 03:39:46.742]  And they take pride in doing it, in deceiving the infidel, what have you.
[03:39:47.902 --> 03:39:49.443]  Right, and I really don't like...
[03:39:50.436 --> 03:39:51.637]  Yeah, they've constantly been doing it.
[03:39:51.657 --> 03:39:53.258]  And now we have Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.
[03:40:20.937 --> 03:40:25.662]  And, you know, the liberals, the lefties, the Democrats, they're completely complicit with it.
[03:40:25.682 --> 03:40:36.754]  Because if you notice, every time something came up that were Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib did something or says something that, you know, most cases people would go, this is not proper.
[03:40:36.774 --> 03:40:37.715]  This is not correct.
[03:40:38.876 --> 03:40:39.657]  But they didn't do that.
[03:40:39.717 --> 03:40:43.441]  The Democrats jumped on board to protect them, to help them.
[03:40:44.449 --> 03:40:46.650]  So, I mean, it's remarkable.
[03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:54.093]  And I think it was the Taliban that was sending videos, because I remember a whole bunch of videos and other stuff talking about and songs come out.
[03:40:54.133 --> 03:40:58.435]  Hey, Mr. Taliban, Taliban banana and all this stuff is crazy.
[03:40:58.455 --> 03:40:59.775]  Hey, I want to thank you for the call, Brandon.
[03:41:00.836 --> 03:41:04.077]  Let's go with Brad from Texas.
[03:41:06.078 --> 03:41:07.038]  Hey, how you doing, Brad?
[03:41:07.778 --> 03:41:08.759]  How's it going, man?
[03:41:09.439 --> 03:41:10.019]  Good, good.
[03:41:10.139 --> 03:41:10.720]  Thanks for calling.
[03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:13.981]  What I want to talk about today is quite interesting.
[03:41:14.557 --> 03:41:24.861]  Because us Jews are celebrating Passover, and this was the holiday where Moses led our ancestors out of Egypt to the Promised Land, to modern-day Israel.
[03:41:26.482 --> 03:41:38.407]  And I think this is interesting, because Moses was told by God that you're going to face the enemies of Amalek, of Midian, the Canaanites, and the Philistines.
[03:41:39.047 --> 03:41:43.309]  And I think that's so prophetic, because all those nations today, if you look at what they
[03:41:44.176 --> 03:41:51.339]  It's Jordan, Syria, the Arab territories, and Israel.
[03:41:54.100 --> 03:42:04.864]  And I see Ezekiel chapter 38, and it says, And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Gog of the land of Magog.
[03:42:05.424 --> 03:42:11.066]  And that's believed to be, in Christian and Jewish end times, either Russia or Turkey.
[03:42:11.926 --> 03:42:17.352]  And you know, right now in the Middle East, that there's a coalition with Russia, Turkey, and Iran.
[03:42:17.372 --> 03:42:26.861]  And in Ezekiel, chapter 38, verse 5, it says, the coalition will be made of Paras, Cush, Put, and Magog.
[03:42:27.082 --> 03:42:34.029]  Paras is Persia, Cush and Put are other Muslim countries in North Africa, and Magog is either believed to be Russia or Turkey.
[03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:35.511]  Yeah, I've heard that.
[03:42:35.591 --> 03:42:42.816]  Maycock has been known to be called Russia, and I've heard that quite often, and you're absolutely correct.
[03:42:42.856 --> 03:42:45.358]  And what we're seeing is the end time.
[03:42:45.798 --> 03:42:46.819]  We're seeing it happen.
[03:42:46.899 --> 03:42:48.360]  It's all about to come to a head.
[03:42:48.400 --> 03:42:53.224]  And remember, President Trump just did a lot for Israel, and the Muslim community doesn't like it.
[03:42:53.624 --> 03:42:54.825]  Hey, my name is Will Johnson.
[03:42:54.845 --> 03:42:55.906]  This is the InfoWars.
[03:42:55.966 --> 03:42:57.988]  I'm filling in for Alex Jones for the last hour.
[03:42:58.068 --> 03:42:59.729]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:43:02.338 --> 03:43:02.639]  Living in...
[03:43:06.836 --> 03:43:10.760]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[03:43:11.180 --> 03:43:13.001]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:43:13.102 --> 03:43:13.802]  Good to talk to you.
[03:43:14.142 --> 03:43:18.306]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:43:18.546 --> 03:43:20.288]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[03:43:20.388 --> 03:43:24.752]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:43:24.972 --> 03:43:26.893]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[03:43:26.953 --> 03:43:31.297]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[03:43:31.377 --> 03:43:32.859]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:43:32.919 --> 03:43:33.399]  Tell us about it.
[03:43:33.459 --> 03:43:34.159]  Well, it's really great.
[03:43:34.179 --> 03:43:35.379]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:43:35.419 --> 03:43:35.860]  I take it.
[03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:36.540]  It tastes good.
[03:43:36.600 --> 03:43:38.300]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:40.061]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:43:40.201 --> 03:43:42.701]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[03:43:42.721 --> 03:43:43.502]  So I really like it.
[03:43:43.522 --> 03:43:46.202]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:43:46.242 --> 03:43:47.783]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:43:47.903 --> 03:43:49.783]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:43:49.883 --> 03:43:50.363]  So, yeah.
[03:43:50.743 --> 03:43:52.604]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:43:53.064 --> 03:43:55.385]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.

[03:46:24.206 --> 03:46:25.507]  Brain chips in the troops.
[03:46:25.847 --> 03:46:30.750]  They give the troops special vaccines that are really nanotech that already re-engineer their brains.
[03:46:31.250 --> 03:46:32.571]  Now there it is, the gay bomb.
[03:46:32.811 --> 03:46:33.692]  Look it up for yourself.
[03:46:33.752 --> 03:46:36.313]  I mean, this is what they're... What do you think tap water is?
[03:46:36.373 --> 03:46:37.574]  It's a gay bomb, baby.
[03:46:37.794 --> 03:46:40.856]  And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings.
[03:46:41.136 --> 03:46:42.837]  I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly.
[03:46:42.857 --> 03:46:43.978]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:46:46.682 --> 03:46:49.283]  I'm up here bashing it because I don't like gay people.
[03:46:49.603 --> 03:46:53.625]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[03:47:05.790 --> 03:47:08.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:47:30.812 --> 03:47:33.994]  And now your host, Will Johnson.
[03:47:36.836 --> 03:47:37.397]  Welcome back.
[03:47:37.417 --> 03:47:38.017]  Welcome back.
[03:47:38.557 --> 03:47:42.620]  So let me get in this really quick because I see the phone lines are full.
[03:47:42.640 --> 03:47:46.563]  We're going to try to get through some of these really quick, but I want to point out something really quick too.
[03:47:47.532 --> 03:47:54.457]  When I mentioned earlier that there was 11 Christians every day are being killed simply because they believe in Christ.
[03:47:54.717 --> 03:47:55.818]  That's it.
[03:47:56.098 --> 03:48:00.361]  To give just a few examples, I mean the list is long, but just to give a few examples.
[03:48:00.462 --> 03:48:01.602]  One of them is North Korea.
[03:48:01.642 --> 03:48:04.304]  Christianity is the number one enemy of the state.
[03:48:05.265 --> 03:48:06.366]  This is ridiculous.
[03:48:06.946 --> 03:48:09.968]  In Afghanistan, Christianity is not even permitted.
[03:48:11.109 --> 03:48:11.249]  Right?
[03:48:12.947 --> 03:48:15.067]  And where, where are the liberals at on all this?
[03:48:15.247 --> 03:48:17.188]  You know, they're, they're complicit with the two.
[03:48:17.208 --> 03:48:24.089]  Do you remember Hillary Clinton said that Christianity is the problem in America?
[03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:25.129]  Do you remember that?
[03:48:25.709 --> 03:48:27.409]  I'm wondering how many people remember that.
[03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:28.430]  We have to think about it.
[03:48:28.730 --> 03:48:31.130]  And another thing, where is the Pope on all of this?
[03:48:32.610 --> 03:48:33.090]  Think about that.
[03:48:33.150 --> 03:48:34.191]  Where is the Pope on all this?
[03:48:34.331 --> 03:48:34.571]  Okay.
[03:48:34.831 --> 03:48:36.291]  Let's go back to the phone lines here.
[03:48:36.791 --> 03:48:42.312]  Let's go with, uh, let's see, let's go with David from Michigan.
[03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:46.971]  Hey, how you doing, Will?
[03:48:47.472 --> 03:48:48.353]  Hey, how's it going, Dave?
[03:48:49.355 --> 03:48:50.556]  Oh, doing fantastic.
[03:48:50.596 --> 03:48:51.578]  Love what you do there.
[03:48:51.598 --> 03:48:52.699]  Can I do a product plug?
[03:48:53.701 --> 03:48:54.462]  Sure, make it quick.
[03:48:55.476 --> 03:48:56.076]  Absolutely.
[03:48:56.116 --> 03:49:01.938]  Me and my wife, we take the bodies, the mouthwash, the toothpaste, the colloidal silver, the nasa iodine.
[03:49:02.278 --> 03:49:03.178]  We have it all.
[03:49:03.618 --> 03:49:21.663]  But anyways, yeah, I always kick around the idea that I had heard once that the second coming of Christ would symbolize the fall of the Church, and then would the second coming of Christ at that point be the coming of a physical being or the awakening of Christ's consciousness within a person?
[03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:24.150]  Well, you know what?
[03:49:24.210 --> 03:49:25.810]  The physical church is already falling.
[03:49:25.850 --> 03:49:34.233]  You have the physical church today, where it even says in the Bible, talks about homosexuality, and you have churches today that is openly supporting homosexuality.
[03:49:34.593 --> 03:49:37.394]  And they're encouraging their congregation to embrace it.
[03:49:37.874 --> 03:49:38.694]  We're seeing it today.
[03:49:38.955 --> 03:49:43.056]  And the churches today in America don't even speak out against all of the abortion that's taking place.
[03:49:43.416 --> 03:49:45.777]  We're seeing that right now today.
[03:49:46.397 --> 03:49:47.237]  And it is happening.
[03:49:50.739 --> 03:49:51.839]  Absolutely believe that.
[03:49:52.715 --> 03:49:53.076]  Absolutely.
[03:49:53.096 --> 03:49:53.796]  Hey, thank you for the call.
[03:49:53.816 --> 03:49:57.040]  I'm going to try to get to some of these really quick because we have a lot in here.
[03:49:57.060 --> 03:49:59.202]  I'm going to try to get to as many as possible.
[03:49:59.682 --> 03:50:02.525]  Let's go with Brandon from Canada.
[03:50:06.989 --> 03:50:07.610]  How you doing, Brandon?
[03:50:08.351 --> 03:50:09.432]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:50:10.132 --> 03:50:10.373]  Good.
[03:50:11.514 --> 03:50:11.754]  Good.
[03:50:12.895 --> 03:50:13.936]  Yeah, Sri Lanka.
[03:50:14.296 --> 03:50:14.657]  Terrible.
[03:50:14.977 --> 03:50:15.898]  Absolutely terrible.
[03:50:16.798 --> 03:50:27.123]  I just, like, I saw you guys posting up the thing about how Hillary and Obama did the thing about, what, Easter worshipers?
[03:50:27.163 --> 03:50:28.164]  What a load of crap!
[03:50:28.824 --> 03:50:29.705]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:50:29.785 --> 03:50:42.151]  It doesn't make, like, I mean, I grew up as a professing Christian in the Christian Reformed Church, but I totally agree.
[03:50:44.085 --> 03:50:52.274]  I don't necessarily take Alex Jones's views on Christianity, but I agree, there is a huge attack on Christianity.
[03:50:57.478 --> 03:50:59.420]  Why aren't Christians talking about this?
[03:50:59.520 --> 03:51:01.322]  Why aren't Christians speaking up?
[03:51:02.283 --> 03:51:02.724]  You know?
[03:51:02.804 --> 03:51:03.104]  You know what?
[03:51:03.124 --> 03:51:03.885]  You're absolutely right.
[03:51:03.925 --> 03:51:14.256]  And it's the same thing, what I just mentioned, how the churches aren't talking about the homosexuality and how it's infiltrating the churches and how come they're not talking about the abortion.
[03:51:15.016 --> 03:51:16.317]  That's just another example.
[03:51:16.857 --> 03:51:22.339]  Every church in America should be screaming out right now about how Christians across the planet are being killed.
[03:51:22.719 --> 03:51:24.100]  They should be talking about it.
[03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:28.922]  And for the most part, they don't because they don't want to run off the people in their church.
[03:51:29.342 --> 03:51:35.564]  They feel that if they sit, if they talk about these things that are so touchy sensitive, that they're going to leave.
[03:51:35.864 --> 03:51:37.725]  You're Christian or you're not.
[03:51:38.425 --> 03:51:40.306]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[03:51:40.446 --> 03:51:41.266]  It's one or the other.
[03:51:41.727 --> 03:51:42.787]  Hey, I want to thank you for the call.
[03:51:43.632 --> 03:51:45.773]  All right, let's go with Adam.
[03:51:46.153 --> 03:51:47.473]  Let's go with Adam from California.
[03:51:48.273 --> 03:51:49.253]  Hey, how's it going Will?
[03:51:49.273 --> 03:51:51.214]  What's going on Adam?
[03:51:51.594 --> 03:51:57.495]  You are aware of and planning on attending the Free Speech Rally in San Francisco on May 3rd?
[03:51:58.556 --> 03:52:00.776]  Yes, yes I am.
[03:52:01.096 --> 03:52:01.897]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[03:52:01.937 --> 03:52:07.618]  I'm actually one of the speakers there and the reason why I'm going because of the way the tech companies, the way the liberal media, the way
[03:52:08.218 --> 03:52:12.481]  The whole censorship against conservatives, the censorship against Infowars.
[03:52:12.962 --> 03:52:19.466]  We need to bring it to attention and how I don't like how these politicians are not addressing the issue like they should be.
[03:52:19.686 --> 03:52:20.827]  Now, you have Ted Cruz.
[03:52:20.847 --> 03:52:27.292]  He'll come out and he's done hearings where he talked about the censorship and he addressed it with Facebook and Twitter.
[03:52:27.672 --> 03:52:29.433]  But not enough is being done.
[03:52:30.134 --> 03:52:30.694]  Not enough.
[03:52:30.874 --> 03:52:34.957]  And with 2020 coming, we most definitely need to be hitting on it.
[03:52:35.037 --> 03:52:37.299]  And I will be there in San Francisco on May 3rd.
[03:52:38.513 --> 03:52:40.234]  Should contact Devin Nunes.
[03:52:40.575 --> 03:52:45.018]  He's a California representative in the area here, and he's had his free speech suppressed.
[03:52:46.279 --> 03:52:47.920]  Trying to get him to come would be a good idea.
[03:52:48.821 --> 03:52:52.864]  Yeah, he actually has a lawsuit with Twitter, which personally, I don't think is enough.
[03:52:53.264 --> 03:52:54.765]  I think it needs to be $1 billion.
[03:52:55.046 --> 03:52:56.046]  But hey, thanks for the call.
[03:52:57.067 --> 03:53:00.490]  All right, let's go with... Let's see who's been on here long.
[03:53:00.510 --> 03:53:01.791]  Let's go with Andy from California.
[03:53:04.493 --> 03:53:04.733]  Hello, Andy.
[03:53:04.773 --> 03:53:05.574]  Can you hear me all right?
[03:53:06.194 --> 03:53:07.295]  Yes, I can hear you loud and clear.
[03:53:08.317 --> 03:53:08.717]  Alright, good.
[03:53:08.737 --> 03:53:12.841]  I just want to make one point about the A.I.
[03:53:12.901 --> 03:53:15.844]  Antichrist that people always talk about.
[03:53:16.445 --> 03:53:17.646]  Alex Jones talks about it.
[03:53:18.487 --> 03:53:20.088]  That Steve Carell guy talks about it.
[03:53:21.109 --> 03:53:22.911]  I'm pretty sure that's like a decoy.
[03:53:24.272 --> 03:53:28.516]  Like, that's what the real Antichrist is going to pretend to save you from.
[03:53:28.837 --> 03:53:30.238]  The Antichrist pretends to be Christ.
[03:53:31.320 --> 03:53:31.520]  Right?
[03:53:31.860 --> 03:53:37.204]  No, yeah, well, see, yeah, you know, there are many antichrists, and I truly believe that Obama is one of them.
[03:53:37.244 --> 03:53:52.733]  There are many antichrists, but there is one antichrist that will come and make everyone believe that he is here for positive things, is gonna, and bring everything, and bring order to the planet, and he's gonna do miraculous things, and so many people, even the elect, will follow him.
[03:53:53.353 --> 03:53:55.074]  But there are many antichrists.
[03:53:56.155 --> 03:53:59.777]  Right, there's many of them, but you read the one, uh, you read the book of Joel,
[03:54:00.563 --> 03:54:03.705]  And that's the only son of perdition is the devil himself.
[03:54:04.325 --> 03:54:05.326]  You get kicked out of heaven.
[03:54:05.366 --> 03:54:07.007]  A lot of people don't realize that.
[03:54:07.027 --> 03:54:07.828]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:54:08.828 --> 03:54:09.329]  Absolutely.
[03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:10.049]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:54:10.830 --> 03:54:11.190]  Absolutely.
[03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:12.070]  You're absolutely 100% correct.
[03:54:12.431 --> 03:54:13.251]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[03:54:13.751 --> 03:54:17.114]  Let's go with, what is that, E-Frog from Alaska?
[03:54:18.815 --> 03:54:19.355]  How you doing?
[03:54:19.555 --> 03:54:20.176]  Yes, sir.
[03:54:20.416 --> 03:54:21.556]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:54:23.258 --> 03:54:23.738]  No problem.
[03:54:23.758 --> 03:54:24.278]  Thanks for calling.
[03:54:25.299 --> 03:54:26.480]  I hope Alex is listening.
[03:54:26.720 --> 03:54:29.962]  Alex encourages everyone to leave the big megachurches.
[03:54:32.864 --> 03:54:36.346]  You know what, I don't have any disagreement with that because, you know, we can go on.
[03:54:36.366 --> 03:54:39.389]  I mean, that could be a three-hour show alone about the megachurches.
[03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:41.010]  But go ahead, what's your statement?
[03:54:41.390 --> 03:54:46.214]  So one of the megachurches is the Mormon Church, and I'm a sixth-generation Mormon Church.
[03:54:46.254 --> 03:54:52.619]  Had ancestors persecuted, and they left Missouri and went to Utah.
[03:54:53.099 --> 03:55:00.105]  Anyways, but I started studying their history, and Joseph Smith claimed to be bigger than Jesus.
[03:55:02.054 --> 03:55:03.455]  Well, yeah, I mean, I've heard that, too.
[03:55:03.495 --> 03:55:08.579]  And they even said that what they even said that Jesus and the devil are brothers.
[03:55:09.179 --> 03:55:12.642]  And then when Jesus returns, that he's going to come down to Utah.
[03:55:12.682 --> 03:55:12.942]  Right.
[03:55:12.982 --> 03:55:16.184]  So it's like, OK, yeah.
[03:55:17.185 --> 03:55:19.787]  All right.
[03:55:19.807 --> 03:55:20.227]  Well, cool.
[03:55:20.267 --> 03:55:21.188]  Well, hey, thanks for the call.
[03:55:21.528 --> 03:55:24.790]  Let's go to Danny from Virginia.
[03:55:25.811 --> 03:55:26.772]  The Trojan horse.
[03:55:26.952 --> 03:55:28.173]  I completely agree.
[03:55:29.281 --> 03:55:29.581]  Go ahead.
[03:55:29.821 --> 03:55:31.342]  Hey Will, thanks for letting me on.
[03:55:31.522 --> 03:55:41.365]  I think we should redefine a religion, that it should be a metric that we measure a religion by, that it should teach you to peacefully coexist with other people of other faiths.
[03:55:41.725 --> 03:55:43.606]  If it doesn't teach you that, it's not a religion.
[03:55:44.086 --> 03:55:45.506]  It's a war plan.
[03:55:45.627 --> 03:55:47.007]  It's an infiltration plan.
[03:55:47.107 --> 03:55:47.807]  It's a deception.
[03:55:48.668 --> 03:55:53.829]  So Islam should lose its tax-free benefit status all around the Western world.
[03:55:54.069 --> 03:55:58.691]  All those mosques should be taxed on property taxes, and we've got to hit them in the purse at the very least.
[03:55:59.620 --> 03:56:00.921]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[03:56:01.401 --> 03:56:10.727]  I mean, you know, I take, like on my video log, I'll take phone calls and I've actually had a Muslim call in and say, why are you always attacking Muslims?
[03:56:10.787 --> 03:56:11.707]  And I said, well, you know what?
[03:56:11.727 --> 03:56:14.989]  Because the Muslim community is not speaking out enough.
[03:56:15.310 --> 03:56:16.390]  They're not saying enough.
[03:56:16.430 --> 03:56:19.892]  You're not screaming saying, stop this violence, stop this hate.
[03:56:20.173 --> 03:56:20.993]  They're not doing it.
[03:56:21.693 --> 03:56:24.375]  I mean, because if they were doing it, then we would be able to see it.
[03:56:24.495 --> 03:56:25.416]  But I'm not seeing it.
[03:56:25.796 --> 03:56:27.317]  So it's crazy.
[03:56:27.777 --> 03:56:28.137]  Go ahead.
[03:56:30.166 --> 03:56:31.767]  Okay, let's go.
[03:56:31.787 --> 03:56:33.429]  How much time do we have?
[03:56:33.529 --> 03:56:34.730]  Okay, one more.
[03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:35.550]  Let's go one more.
[03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:37.392]  Let's go with Michael from Texas.
[03:56:39.513 --> 03:56:39.954]  How you doing?
[03:56:40.054 --> 03:56:40.514]  Hello, Will.
[03:56:41.215 --> 03:56:41.475]  Hey.
[03:56:41.935 --> 03:56:43.316]  Hi, how you doing, Will?
[03:56:43.857 --> 03:56:49.021]  No, I agree with you on this issue of Christianity being under attack.
[03:56:49.641 --> 03:56:59.649]  And one thing I did notice is like, and just going back to this, the Mueller investigation, it just seemed that all of the news
[03:57:00.339 --> 03:57:03.280]  All of the news outlets were in unison.
[03:57:03.300 --> 03:57:08.842]  You know, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, they're all in unison.
[03:57:08.862 --> 03:57:11.523]  They all had the same message.
[03:57:11.863 --> 03:57:13.043]  No, absolutely.
[03:57:13.143 --> 03:57:15.064]  No, I did see it too.
[03:57:15.344 --> 03:57:19.985]  The only thing that they weren't together on is when they went to Roger Stone's home.
[03:57:20.445 --> 03:57:27.068]  You notice it was only CNN that was there with the cameras when they were breaking down the door, basically, when they were at the door, when the FBI was at the door.
[03:57:27.128 --> 03:57:28.128]  It was only CNN there.
[03:57:28.689 --> 03:57:29.129]  That was it.
[03:57:29.450 --> 03:57:30.551]  Hey, I want to thank you for the call.
[03:57:31.311 --> 03:57:31.611]  All right.
[03:57:31.952 --> 03:57:33.052]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:33.133 --> 03:57:34.574]  This is the Info Wars.
[03:57:34.814 --> 03:57:36.535]  I was sitting here for Alex Jones today.
[03:57:37.256 --> 03:57:41.559]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com and you've got to try out the X2.
[03:57:41.659 --> 03:57:44.521]  This is such a remarkable product.
[03:57:44.581 --> 03:57:49.325]  I know all the crazy stuff going on, but I had to talk about the X2 because it is wonderful.
[03:57:50.006 --> 03:57:50.846]  This is the Info Wars.
[03:57:53.080 --> 03:58:08.593]  Controlling the Human Mind, one of the most important books that I've ever written, deals with the whole concept of mind effects, mind control, going back to the historical perspective as well, as sort of the ways in which we might be able to enhance our performance.
[03:58:08.653 --> 03:58:11.976]  One of my classics, all of my books and videos are available.
[03:58:12.276 --> 03:58:13.197]  We're good to go.
[03:58:33.178 --> 03:58:37.762]  Both President Obama and Hillary Clinton found it impossible to say the words radical Islam
