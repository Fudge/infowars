[00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:23.320]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:25.143]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.080]  InfoWars.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.041]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:51.842 --> 00:01:00.325]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.192]  It's Wednesday, April 3rd, 2019.
[00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:20.575]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and you can really mark your calendar.
[00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:31.420]  April 3rd, 2019 is a date where you could really say the United States is in the latter stages of collapse.
[00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:37.824]  Now, Trump's been trying to shore up the sailboat before it capsizes, and it's done a valiant job overall.
[00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:43.014]  And globalism itself is in deep trouble, because it never delivered on what it said it would do.
[00:01:43.034 --> 00:01:46.415]  It was designed to collapse third world countries and consolidate control.
[00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.336]  And then it was designed to collapse first world nations.
[00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:55.817]  So globalism is being rejected as a system, but its by-product, or its venom, is killing us.
[00:01:57.118 --> 00:02:00.138]  The third world is completely collapsing almost everywhere.
[00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:05.680]  It's being directed as a weapon by stay-behind groups of globalists against the nation states.
[00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:08.246]  And we've got the headlines here.
[00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:14.128]  If you're not paying attention, the world-ending storm of a third world war is gathering in Venezuela.
[00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:21.230]  Russians, Chinese, the U.S., Venezuelans storm border as Colombia warns Russia.
[00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.670]  Looks like scenes of the U.S.
[00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.431]  being overrun.
[00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.672]  And now they're banning opposition leaders in Venezuela.
[00:02:31.738 --> 00:02:33.459]  Continuing shock video.
[00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:46.686]  Migrants drag screaming children underwater through Constantino wire to enter the United States illegally.
[00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.047]  This is the hell.
[00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:59.453]  And these people are supposedly heroes, taking their children through hundreds of miles of desert to do this, to get the welfare and bankrupt the country.
[00:03:01.263 --> 00:03:06.065]  And remember the little girl that got drugged in the United States over a hundred miles.
[00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.246]  She hadn't eaten in a day.
[00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.507]  She was taken with her mother to a facility for food and water.
[00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:20.552]  And of course America was bad for saving her and Trump was bad for saving her and they photoshopped the president holding, you know, the little girl hostage basically.
[00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:21.792]  None of it was true.
[00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:27.135]  Well that's the same paradigm that we see over and over and over again now.
[00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:35.088]  Because we're the bad guys because we're taking care of all these people and they're being turned into political enemies against this nation.
[00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:46.416]  Remember that mother who brought her daughter hundreds of miles, over 150 miles, over that border, into that border in the dead of night, and it was America's fault when we saved her.
[00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:47.958]  We were the bad ones.
[00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:50.479]  This country better get itself together.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.081]  So yes, globalism's in deep trouble.
[00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.972]  But its aftermath and the storm it was planning to take down nation states is still taking place.
[00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:03.135]  It's kind of like a sun blows up in a supernova.
[00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:04.697]  The sun is gone.
[00:04:04.797 --> 00:04:06.758]  Globalism's in deep trouble, falling apart.
[00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:19.829]  But the shockwave of its implosion and its ongoing operations, even though it itself is basically gone, it still has armies and still has systems and still has repercussions like
[00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:24.930]  What you see ripples in a pond going out.
[00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:29.458]  So this is one incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:31.100]  Total maximum red alert.
[00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.712]  The Democrats and the Globalists are scrambling for power.
[00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:40.415]  They believe that they might be able to hold on to nation-states, and then use the crises to get even more power.
[00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:49.460]  They won't have their big, grand, global government just yet, but they could still, still have their way with some gun owners, some Christians, and some conservatives.
[00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:50.541]  You ask why?
[00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:52.062]  Because they want to mount your head on the wall.
[00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:54.123]  Because they know you're better than them.
[00:04:55.524 --> 00:04:58.126]  These Globalists that run our government, they are the scum of the earth.
[00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.987]  Their instinct is evil and lies.
[00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:05.224]  I mean, I've explained this.
[00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:17.257]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of social media last year, saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state, and just said I did it.
[00:05:18.578 --> 00:05:24.825]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:42.828]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here, when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines, saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:05:44.457 --> 00:05:46.599]  And so the letters are going to be sent out Monday.
[00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:49.081]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:51.063]  And we're going to drop the hammer on you.
[00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.405]  We've got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.188]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.090]  All I have is you supporting us.
[00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:00.812]  That's all I have.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.504]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:14.133]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:39.440]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Wednesday, April 3rd, 2019 Global Transmission.
[00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:46.144]  Mike Adams is going to be hosting the fourth hour, and we're going to have open phones like we did yesterday, but I intend to go to your calls a lot earlier.
[00:06:46.324 --> 00:06:52.588]  I'm sorry I didn't get to a lot of you guys at the end of the hour, but I had an emergency that I had to take.
[00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:59.912]  Care of that came up, so I went to rebroadcast for 15 minutes before Paul Joseph Watson took over live.
[00:07:00.392 --> 00:07:07.216]  So those folks that were unable to get on air, you'll be first in line today if you let the folks answering the phones know that.
[00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:17.443]  But the big theme I want to discuss today, and I'd like the callers to call in about, and at least give me your view on, then you can segue into a second point if you'd like, but please humor me.
[00:07:18.644 --> 00:07:32.092]  Is the fact that what you see happening in Venezuela has all of the trimmings and all of the fixings, all the ingredients and then some, for how you see a new world war start.
[00:07:33.112 --> 00:07:43.378]  Now, many historians and analysts are saying, if you're not paying attention to the world-ending storm of third world war that's gathering in Venezuela, you're crazy.
[00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:49.583]  I agree with the CIA when they call the Cold War World War III.
[00:07:50.264 --> 00:07:51.645]  This is World War IV.
[00:07:52.105 --> 00:08:00.152]  It's giant migrant waves, it's economic war, it's authoritarianism, and then it's gathering armies, cyber war, and then physical war.
[00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:08.599]  Venezuela has, for now several years, around a thousand people a day die of starvation.
[00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.162]  The government passed a law a few years ago making it illegal to call it that.
[00:08:13.187 --> 00:08:17.193]  The average Venezuelan the last year has lost 20, what was it, 27 pounds.
[00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:22.780]  You're not seeing any fat people there anymore.
[00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.889]  And Brazil and Colombia have put up fences and troops.
[00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:37.031]  Because everyone's fleeing, and when you get... It was 5 million last year, now they say it's 5 million this month, so it's total collapse.
[00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:43.356]  Power's been off, gas is out, electricity's down most of the time, starvation, murder, death.
[00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:52.023]  And now they're breaking over the borders, and there are Russian and Chinese troops there that are reportedly involved.
[00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:55.806]  And so, this is the real unraveling of a country.
[00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.462]  Now, Russia and China are there because it's their strategic doorstep to the U.S.
[00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:08.466]  In northern South America, they also have more oil than any other country per capita per square mile, even more than Saudi Arabia.
[00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:11.187]  Probably have five times the oil Texas has.
[00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:13.487]  And so it's quite the plum.
[00:09:14.608 --> 00:09:18.429]  And things are degenerating very, very quickly.
[00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:25.352]  Now, why is that so important?
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:39.022]  Because if you look at a map of Northern South America, then you see the little isthmus there of Panama up into Southern North America, Mexico.
[00:09:39.202 --> 00:09:46.163]  It's not very far from Venezuela up into Mexico and the United States.
[00:09:46.204 --> 00:09:53.145]  And so the other countries, Brazil, Colombia, others are not letting the illegal aliens stop or stay there.
[00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:53.865]  They deport them.
[00:09:54.901 --> 00:10:02.643]  They ship them out immediately because if people hear there's safe harbor in Costa Rica, it'll go from being a really nice place to a hellhole.
[00:10:04.063 --> 00:10:05.544]  And already Guatemala is a hellhole.
[00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:10.305]  So people are moving north from one hellhole to another to get to El Norte.
[00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:16.307]  So this is all unfolding right now.
[00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:21.728]  And you have the UN setting up the refugee centers through
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:50.441]  The few countries in northern South America into Central America, so that the giant throngs, now in the hundreds of thousands per month, can leapfrog their way through Colombia, as Venezuela tries to completely break the Colombian border, which is happening now, into Panama, into Costa Rica, into Nicaragua, into Honduras, into Guatemala, and then into Mexico.
[00:10:52.918 --> 00:11:02.808]  That is a publicly-planned, U.N.-funded, Obama-funded, State Department Soros-financed Operation One Trillion Percent.
[00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.152]  And that is how they intend to take down America.
[00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:11.958]  Now you're looking at footage from your TV, if you were, from back in October, November, December.
[00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.422]  Now the caravans are double that size.
[00:11:17.168 --> 00:11:21.531]  Last Friday, the Border Patrol issued a total red alert S.O.S.
[00:11:21.612 --> 00:11:23.313]  and said the border is broken.
[00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:32.700]  Previous records were 3,000 a day they were stopping in places like El Paso.
[00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:39.085]  Now it is 15,000 a day and Beto is saying there is no border.
[00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:40.526]  Come on up.
[00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:41.427]  Everything's free.
[00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:42.248]  You deserve it.
[00:11:42.808 --> 00:11:45.731]  They're encouraging lowering the drawbridge.
[00:11:46.704 --> 00:11:55.686]  Meanwhile, I've got stacks of articles of Democratic Party leaders saying, towards Ramos and others, there is no border, you can't stop it, it's gone.
[00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:08.709]  Now, remember if this is successful, when we're in a depression in six months, a year or two, depending on the timetable, and you're living in hell, and there's burning cities and riots, you just remember who did it.
[00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.290]  This is such an incredible time to be alive.
[00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:16.648]  Nobody likes illegal immigration.
[00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:17.308]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:12:17.368 --> 00:12:17.789]  Nobody.
[00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:19.390]  So let's do something about it.
[00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.773]  Let's legalize the first 10.7 million undocumented immigrants that are already here.
[00:12:24.113 --> 00:12:26.555]  Second, is that thing is legalized at all.
[00:12:26.835 --> 00:12:28.656]  A legal and realistic immigration system that works.
[00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:31.598]  This won't be solved with a useless wall.
[00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:34.961]  And then he's got other quotes saying you can't stop it.
[00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:40.504]  So this is where our country is right now.
[00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:42.693]  This is what we've become.
[00:12:42.753 --> 00:12:43.894]  This is what it's turned into.
[00:12:44.614 --> 00:12:47.235]  George Ramos, amnesty for illegals, migrants.
[00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.636]  Nothing we can do to stop them.
[00:12:51.277 --> 00:12:51.917]  Get rid of it.
[00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:53.217]  Get rid of the walls.
[00:12:53.377 --> 00:12:56.298]  Just open up everything.
[00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.959]  Hey, dude, it's so great down there, Mr. Ramos.
[00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:02.241]  You're so busy pissing on America and bitching and complaining every ten seconds.
[00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:06.862]  Why don't you just hoppity scotch on down to Venezuela?
[00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:07.923]  Because Brazil
[00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:33.246]  to the south of Venezuela and Colombia to the west are prosperous compared to Venezuela and they have put up giant fences and armed troops and they're now forcefully shipping people back in and now the Venezuelan troops are showing up and saying no you're not you're gonna take these people and if you're a radio listener you can go to Infowars.com or Newswars.com
[00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:40.273]  Or PrisonPlanet.com to see the videos, to see the photos the establishment doesn't want you to see.
[00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:44.674]  When we come back, shock video, big article up on Infowars.com.
[00:13:45.094 --> 00:13:49.654]  Migrants drag screaming children underwater through Constantino Wire to enter the U.S.
[00:13:49.715 --> 00:13:50.115]  illegally.
[00:13:50.735 --> 00:14:02.297]  You know, I see articles all the time where somebody takes their 10-year-old son or daughter out to Big Bend or something on too far of a hike, and they get stuck out there, and they get dehydrated, and they have to get hauled out by helicopter, and who's waiting?
[00:14:03.037 --> 00:14:03.657]  CPS.
[00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.201]  Because you shouldn't have taken your kid 10 miles out in the desert.
[00:14:07.622 --> 00:14:13.687]  Oh, but when it's 150 through Bar Bar, oh my little cupcake-y, you're so good!
[00:14:15.568 --> 00:14:18.671]  And a lot of these, it turns out, are people smuggling kids on top of it.
[00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:22.274]  Like homeless people use a dog to get more funds or to get more donations.
[00:14:22.835 --> 00:14:23.395]  You ever seen that?
[00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:27.739]  For sympathy, a lot of these kids, it turns out, are smuggled and kidnapped!
[00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:28.840]  But don't even check them!
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.901]  Oh, that'd be too rude!
[00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:32.003]  Don't even find out if this is your daddy or mommy.
[00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:34.832]  It's all coming up.
[00:14:34.892 --> 00:14:42.319]  Now, please remember, we've got to end the special by Thursday or Friday, and I'm going to come up with some new specials.
[00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:45.621]  But we're selling out of many of our best-selling items that helped fund this operation.
[00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:51.747]  We're close to selling out of the fish oil, the krill oil, and the children's brain oil.
[00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:52.468]  It's so awesome.
[00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:57.792]  It's got a whole bunch of the best oils for children, but smaller gel caplets of Honor Roll.
[00:14:58.573 --> 00:14:59.574]  That's close to selling out.
[00:14:59.974 --> 00:15:04.438]  It's still massively discounted, despite that and store-wide free shipping.
[00:15:04.978 --> 00:15:07.761]  Okay, even though it's close to selling out.
[00:15:08.401 --> 00:15:15.487]  We also have other things that are close to selling out, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:15:15.507 --> 00:15:17.609]  If you don't know what turmeric does for you, just go research it.

[00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:31.934]  Unprecedented.

[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.341]  And so much more, but that's all got to end.

[00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:01.493]  It's free shipping too.
[00:16:01.513 --> 00:16:02.534]  There's a whole bunch of deals.
[00:16:02.634 --> 00:16:09.081]  Hi, I'm... Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:13.933]  We are running a special right now that we've never run before.
[00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:18.936]  And even though, DNA Force, overall, is our most profitable product.
[00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:24.118]  And that's because people that know, in the market, what it is, understand it's an incredibly good deal.
[00:16:24.198 --> 00:16:33.503]  The problem is, only athletes and folks that are really into health understand BioPQQ, CoQ10, and other things like this, that come from organically produced sources.
[00:16:33.723 --> 00:16:36.885]  The average person isn't into vitamins or minerals or supplements.
[00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:40.666]  And then only folks that are really into it know about how special it is.
[00:16:40.926 --> 00:16:50.370]  And so when they see us selling DNA Force Plus and the dosages of real PQQ and CoQ10, they go, it's $150 normally?
[00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.871]  When the lowest price leading competitors like $300 and people get it through medical clinics.
[00:16:56.012 --> 00:17:02.734]  Because it is a great nootropic, it's a great thing for the whole body, for all the cells, for the bones, for the DNA, for the telomeres, for the nerves.
[00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:08.298]  But people aren't ready to pay that, so they have synthetic PQQ and CoQ10 at the store.
[00:17:08.358 --> 00:17:12.722]  It's still $50-$60 for a little bitty bottle, and the word is, the synthetic doesn't even get absorbed.
[00:17:12.842 --> 00:17:19.348]  So I set out to give you the best, and back when it was costing us $50-$60 a bottle, we were selling it for $110-$120 a bottle.
[00:17:19.428 --> 00:17:21.509]  We gotta get our money back and fund things.
[00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:29.136]  But I made a big enough deal to sign a contract out a few years to get a super discount on this, but now I gotta move a lot of it.
[00:17:29.236 --> 00:17:30.177]  So, it's normally $100 now.
[00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:32.819]  $110 or so.
[00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:37.222]  It's right now at InfoWarsStore.com selling for only $60.
[00:17:37.522 --> 00:17:41.364]  It's selling for $59.80 right now.
[00:17:41.684 --> 00:17:47.648]  97% reviews for DNA Plus, the new formula of DNA Force, because we made even stronger, by the way, when I made the better deal.
[00:17:47.748 --> 00:17:49.950]  So, it's a great deal at $110 or so.
[00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.273]  It is unbelievably insane at $59.
[00:17:53.714 --> 00:17:56.196]  And the money we do make, obviously, funds this operation.
[00:17:56.216 --> 00:17:58.518]  So, it's like X2, though, the good halogen.
[00:17:58.638 --> 00:18:00.900]  It takes a few weeks for you to notice the results.
[00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:03.203]  Let's just get a bottle and take it.
[00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:05.104]  You think carrots are good for your eyes?
[00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.145]  You think antioxidants are good for your skin?
[00:18:07.345 --> 00:18:10.667]  I mean, it's a joke what happens with this, and it's proven.
[00:18:10.687 --> 00:18:13.889]  You can say it slows the deterioration of the telomeres.
[00:18:13.949 --> 00:18:15.129]  That means they don't die as fast.
[00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:16.570]  You can say that makes them last longer.
[00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.451]  Half empty, half full.
[00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.391]  It does so much more.
[00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:28.457]  ELEV ATP, Ancient Pea Apple Extract, PQQ, CoQ10, Organic Reishi, Astragalus Root Extract, and even more incredible ingredients.
[00:18:28.677 --> 00:18:31.298]  It is 60% off and free shipping.
[00:18:31.418 --> 00:18:32.519]  And if you sign up for AutoShip,
[00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:35.181]  You can cancel any time, every month, every two months, whatever you want.
[00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:38.425]  You just pick the time there, you get an additional 10% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:43.209]  And there's so many other big deals going at infowarestore.com, but DNA Force really is special.
[00:18:43.369 --> 00:18:49.475]  This run at this current rate will sell out in about a week and a half, so this special's not gonna run too long, but I have another order coming in soon.
[00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:54.020]  It won't be sold out for six months this time, because again, I've signed a contract to have it come in as we need it.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.801]  DNA Force Plus, you won't experience it.
[00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:12.908]  Hey, what happens if you try to order your favorite InfoWars life product only to find out they're sold out?
[00:19:12.928 --> 00:19:16.911]  Yeah, I know it kind of sucks, but there is a solution.
[00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:22.675]  All you got to do is go to InfoWarsStore.com and click on Auto Ship.
[00:19:22.915 --> 00:19:25.117]  Problem solved just like that.
[00:19:25.477 --> 00:19:28.219]  And now you're scheduled for regular delivery.
[00:19:28.379 --> 00:19:32.682]  That means no more back orders and you'll never run out of your favorite
[00:19:32.842 --> 00:19:34.003]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:19:34.043 --> 00:19:36.525]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:37.665]  Support the InfoWar!
[00:19:37.806 --> 00:19:42.149]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfoWarStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:20:06.437 --> 00:20:09.041]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.467 --> 00:20:29.848]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:20:30.408 --> 00:20:33.790]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:37.953]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.777]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:20:43.837 --> 00:20:44.657]  You wanna Trump?
[00:20:44.677 --> 00:20:48.360]  You wanna Trump?
[00:20:50.101 --> 00:20:54.624]  Yeah!
[00:20:54.664 --> 00:20:56.725]  Who won the president?
[00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:23.793]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:45.706]  You're watching on television, you're seeing small children bleeding, being drugged through barbed wire, and Constantino wire underwater, and many times by smugglers who use them as human shields.
[00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:48.548]  That's on record in the Washington Post amidst that Senate reports.
[00:21:49.810 --> 00:22:04.398]  And then once they're here, bingo, the asylum system's been overwhelmed, the courts have been overwhelmed, the emergency center's been overwhelmed, Democratic Party vehicles are waiting, many of them hardcore pedophile groups, and the families and children and unaccompanied children disappear.
[00:22:05.745 --> 00:22:17.569]  They're then taking Democratic Party members' homes, who then don't work, but go file for them to get Social Security, file for them to get Medicare, Medicaid, to get all the different food stamps.
[00:22:17.829 --> 00:22:26.591]  And then, on average, each Democrat family has three people living with them, and then they collect up to $15,000 per month of taxpayer money.
[00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:34.079]  They are then given how to vote in the names of dead people, and they rule.
[00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:36.360]  Texas is being conquered as we speak.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.402]  They say we'll be blue by the next election probably, if not after that one.
[00:22:40.848 --> 00:22:47.312]  And the average conservative just drives around a big truck going, I'm tough, yeah boy, doing absolutely nothing.
[00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:51.435]  And then, they're going to socialize and the country will collapse.
[00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:53.096]  And that's just how it works.
[00:22:54.356 --> 00:22:55.197]  And there'll be nowhere to run.
[00:22:56.578 --> 00:23:01.301]  Nowhere to hide from the giant third world collapse now taking place.
[00:23:02.885 --> 00:23:04.546]  All orchestrated by the globalists.
[00:23:04.606 --> 00:23:05.906]  Yes, their system's rejected.
[00:23:05.946 --> 00:23:06.806]  Yes, it's in trouble.
[00:23:06.906 --> 00:23:08.967]  But we're not arresting the leaders of globalism.
[00:23:09.747 --> 00:23:14.149]  We're not cutting the UN funding that's funding the refugee centers that stage the groups to come in.
[00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:18.630]  Trump has cut the funding to the Central American countries that are aiding and abetting this.
[00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.891]  Brazil and Colombia have put their militaries on alert.
[00:23:23.352 --> 00:23:24.532]  They've got big fences up.
[00:23:24.552 --> 00:23:27.413]  They're trying to block the people coming into their country.
[00:23:28.803 --> 00:23:38.168]  And Russian and Chinese troops are massing inside Venezuela in case the United States tries to stop this operation.
[00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:44.271]  And so here's the thing, I don't want troops on the border with Russia, and I don't want provocations, but what if the U.S.
[00:23:44.752 --> 00:23:54.217]  was staging a third world collapse, let's say out of the Middle East, and opened up a conduit up into Georgia, and was shipping in 10 million illegal aliens, Muslims,
[00:23:55.424 --> 00:23:59.065]  And had domestic groups within Russia saying, you've got to let them in, you've got to let them in.
[00:24:00.345 --> 00:24:02.246]  Russia would have a reason to go to war with us.
[00:24:03.306 --> 00:24:07.827]  Now, Russia's not been behind orchestrating all this, but they're jumping on the bandwagon and aiding and abetting it.
[00:24:08.167 --> 00:24:10.948]  China has been orchestrating it through our media and our systems.
[00:24:11.688 --> 00:24:15.649]  They're both there, like the Five Armies War, wanting to get smogs treasured.
[00:24:17.949 --> 00:24:21.310]  Almost as much oil as you've got in Saudi Arabia there and Venezuela.
[00:24:22.742 --> 00:24:24.683]  And so that's why you've got all these buzzards circling.
[00:24:25.143 --> 00:24:28.605]  But this is taking us to the edge of war.
[00:24:29.066 --> 00:24:30.407]  The videos are dramatic.
[00:24:30.747 --> 00:24:32.148]  The photos are shocking.
[00:24:32.508 --> 00:24:34.989]  Some of them we can't even air because we're on broadcast television.
[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.332]  But Venezuela battle war is on.
[00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:44.415]  And even the New York Times admits it is hell on earth, mass death, carnage.
[00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:52.177]  Burn-off rigs, Venezuelan officials block the border with Colombia in a bid to keep out humanitarian supplies.
[00:24:52.218 --> 00:24:52.978]  Remember all that?
[00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:58.343]  Well, now it's spilling over into Colombia itself as they try to flee.
[00:24:58.903 --> 00:25:03.207]  And there have been huge, giant events today as all of this unfolds.
[00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:11.494]  And the Democrats in this country, the leader of the Democratic Party, George Ramos, he says, just get used to it.
[00:25:12.215 --> 00:25:14.137]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:16.914]  It will happen.
[00:25:17.714 --> 00:25:19.116]  This is the way it is now.
[00:25:20.317 --> 00:25:22.580]  Nothing you can do to stop it is the exact quote.
[00:25:25.943 --> 00:25:29.768]  So, from all corners of South America,
[00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:35.927]  All three socialist countries that are in South America are collapsing.
[00:25:35.947 --> 00:25:37.088]  The others are stabilizing.
[00:25:37.748 --> 00:25:46.172]  They're all overwhelming like lifeboats that cut the countries around them and then flooding the UN leapfrog refugee centers towards us.
[00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:51.334]  Again, the hundreds of thousands of the different caravans that slammed into us.
[00:25:52.691 --> 00:25:57.053]  Last year are nothing compared to what is now already slamming in.
[00:25:57.073 --> 00:25:59.354]  The caravans are hitting daily.
[00:26:00.575 --> 00:26:08.059]  15,000 a day per overwhelmed border sector in the three most overwhelmed sectors.
[00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:15.143]  That's 45,000 people a day in just three of the most active sectors that they're catching.
[00:26:16.127 --> 00:26:23.110]  We are hemorrhaging out right now, and the Democrats are, there's nothing you can do, it's all over.
[00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:33.534]  And Beto is, there is no border crisis, there's nothing you can do, come on up, let's do it together!
[00:26:33.555 --> 00:26:41.478]  And it's criminals, and it's poor people, and it's people with diseases, and who the hell knows who they are?
[00:26:41.498 --> 00:26:43.899]  Who the hell knows who they are, but it doesn't matter.
[00:26:45.199 --> 00:27:05.345]  Because the Democrats are going to suck them as a permanent underclass into a giant vacuum cleaner that will be a permanent underclass that they control and that they skim the welfare money off of and who they use as the decisive voting block to break this country's back once and for all.
[00:27:06.745 --> 00:27:08.286]  So what does the President do?
[00:27:09.726 --> 00:27:12.807]  He doesn't just declare the emergency over law enforcement.
[00:27:13.618 --> 00:27:15.239]  They could circumvent that in Congress.
[00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.541]  As Commander-in-Chief, his job is to protect the border.
[00:27:17.861 --> 00:27:42.041]  If he declares a full emergency as Commander-in-Chief, a full, real national emergency, not what his lawyer is tricking him to do, this baby one, and he orders a couple hundred thousand troops down to that border, and he pulls them out of Afghanistan, he pulls some out of these other areas, like Korea, and puts it where we need it on our border, it needs to be done now.
[00:27:43.885 --> 00:27:50.935]  And I guarantee you, they get the Army Corps engineers to drop what they're doing, and to get down there, they can build and block, because you gotta keep them out.
[00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:55.121]  Because the way the laws are written, once they get here, bingo!
[00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:59.639]  You get everything free and there's no immigration judges anymore.
[00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:01.441]  They're now backlogged six years.
[00:28:01.701 --> 00:28:02.162]  You're done.
[00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:03.323]  Everything's free.
[00:28:03.343 --> 00:28:05.245]  900 sanctuary cities.
[00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:07.948]  You can have TB and cough on people's kids.
[00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:08.869]  Doesn't matter.
[00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.330]  You're in.
[00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.231]  You can be a smuggler.
[00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:11.452]  You can be a coyote.
[00:28:11.753 --> 00:28:12.814]  You can be a murderer.
[00:28:13.054 --> 00:28:14.236]  You can be a child molester.
[00:28:15.663 --> 00:28:17.124]  This is a system-wide collapse.
[00:28:17.604 --> 00:28:20.625]  Texas border city overwhelmed by surge of Central American migrants.
[00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.246]  That was last week.
[00:28:23.006 --> 00:28:27.068]  And Mexico and its socialist president is giving them free passage.
[00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:31.490]  He lied to Trump a few months ago and said, oh yeah, I'll stop them.
[00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.030]  Wink, wink.
[00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.130]  Because Mexico could stop them.
[00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.852]  They're not stopping them.
[00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:37.792]  They're not stopping them.
[00:28:37.812 --> 00:28:38.593]  They're not stopping them.
[00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:41.743]  And the Central American gangs are so bad now.
[00:28:41.823 --> 00:28:43.025]  Cancun's shutting down.
[00:28:43.585 --> 00:28:44.807]  Hotels are a third the price.
[00:28:44.867 --> 00:28:46.288]  Gun battles and death every night.
[00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:51.374]  Mexico will fall even more, but the new Mexican president doesn't care as long as he can destroy America.
[00:28:51.414 --> 00:28:52.415]  That's all he wants.
[00:28:52.435 --> 00:28:58.642]  And then we'll all live in misery together with open sewage running down the street and drug gangs ruling everyone.
[00:28:58.942 --> 00:28:59.603]  That's America.
[00:29:06.047 --> 00:29:09.390]  Just please remember, if you want to keep hearing this show on air, pray for us.
[00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:10.571]  We're praying for you.
[00:29:10.751 --> 00:29:12.152]  And please don't forget, store-wide free shipping.
[00:29:12.412 --> 00:29:15.134]  And the biggest sell ever, 50-60% off on all the supplements.
[00:29:15.214 --> 00:29:16.255]  But, it's got to end.
[00:29:16.275 --> 00:29:26.243]  There's a bunch of things like the fish oil, and even X2, and even X3, and bodies, and the bone broth, and turbo force, and brain force, and super silver wound gel are all very close to selling out.
[00:29:26.263 --> 00:29:27.263]  So those will be pulled soon.
[00:29:27.283 --> 00:29:28.704]  50-60% off on all the items.
[00:29:28.785 --> 00:29:32.868]  But, infowarshore.com, let's make no mistake, we're not up here puffing our importance.
[00:29:33.368 --> 00:29:35.409]  We're just folks ready to resist these people.
[00:29:35.869 --> 00:29:37.010]  And of course, it's paying off.
[00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:37.770]  Folks want freedom.
[00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:40.312]  But this, we're in the center of a war now.
[00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:50.637]  For a pro-human future, or an anti-human future, but whatever you do, however you're listening, on satellite, on TV, on radio, at InfoWars.com forward slash show, tell other people about it.

[00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:05.690]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.551]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:31:07.671 --> 00:31:08.091]  It is.
[00:31:08.271 --> 00:31:12.674]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:31:13.154 --> 00:31:14.275]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:31:14.295 --> 00:31:16.256]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:31:16.316 --> 00:31:18.637]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:31:18.798 --> 00:31:20.359]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:31:20.439 --> 00:31:21.819]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.120]  You've got the children's.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.221]  You've got the adults.
[00:31:24.381 --> 00:31:25.281]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:31:25.381 --> 00:31:28.743]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:31:28.784 --> 00:31:31.125]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:31:31.505 --> 00:31:33.366]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[00:31:33.567 --> 00:31:34.447]  You want something like this?
[00:31:34.547 --> 00:31:35.408]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:31:35.528 --> 00:31:37.389]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:31:37.449 --> 00:31:38.570]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.871]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:31:40.891 --> 00:31:45.334]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:31:47.096 --> 00:31:51.639]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:31:54.608 --> 00:32:00.428]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:32:00.648 --> 00:32:01.371]  I just can't do it!
[00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:08.793]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:32:09.133 --> 00:32:15.034]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:27.538]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:33:06.392 --> 00:33:10.556]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.986 --> 00:33:21.707]  Big Brother.
[00:33:22.768 --> 00:33:24.349]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:26.972]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:28.462 --> 00:33:29.382]  You want answers?
[00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:32.183]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.283 --> 00:33:38.605]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.806 --> 00:33:45.087]  Ladies and gentlemen, mark your calendar.
[00:33:47.107 --> 00:33:50.968]  You can officially say that April 3rd, 2019 is the day that the U.S.
[00:33:51.008 --> 00:33:53.929]  border was officially collapsed.
[00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.910]  And not because of
[00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.931]  The valiant work of the Border Patrol.
[00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:04.813]  Not because of the hard work of President Trump or our military, or you trying to get the word out, but it's official.
[00:34:05.414 --> 00:34:12.937]  The Border Patrol head came out last Friday and said, we are in a red alert crisis.
[00:34:12.997 --> 00:34:14.058]  The border has collapsed.
[00:34:14.498 --> 00:34:19.400]  We have 15,000 people a day slamming that we're catching.
[00:34:21.181 --> 00:34:24.202]  Our beds only hold 5,000 in these sectors.
[00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:24.883]  It's over.
[00:34:25.714 --> 00:34:26.515]  They don't have men.
[00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:27.476]  They don't have food.
[00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:28.418]  They don't have water.
[00:34:28.658 --> 00:34:31.562]  The Democrats have buses lined up and vans.
[00:34:32.923 --> 00:34:35.567]  And they are loading them and taking them God knows where.
[00:34:35.827 --> 00:34:36.948]  People say, well, just arrest them.
[00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:38.330]  Oh, yeah.
[00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:40.453]  What does one cop do with 500 people?
[00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:43.430]  What are you gonna do?
[00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:54.532]  If you have a party at your house, and you're trying to put a party on for 20 people, and you're cooking the hamburgers, and you're getting the Coca-Cola out, and you're telling people where the channel changer is to watch the game, you can't run a party with one person.
[00:34:55.132 --> 00:34:57.012]  That's a party with chips and dip!
[00:34:57.572 --> 00:35:00.093]  This ain't your NFL party, baby.
[00:35:02.193 --> 00:35:05.054]  This is the collapse of the United States.
[00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:12.075]  This is football stadiums of people slamming the border every day.
[00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:14.861]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:35:15.341 --> 00:35:22.084]  They're catching football stadium groups and then just saying, okay, at least organize here.
[00:35:22.864 --> 00:35:25.825]  And they try to feed the little kids that are sick most of the time.
[00:35:27.046 --> 00:35:32.748]  And sometimes there'll be a man with four kids or a weird, and the kids are crying for mommy and mommy ain't there.
[00:35:32.808 --> 00:35:37.070]  And the Border Patrol is freaking out and being demoralized.
[00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.530]  They were very positive about Trump.
[00:35:38.771 --> 00:35:39.631]  They were very excited.
[00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:44.096]  But then the globalist onslaught hit that they were planning.
[00:35:46.097 --> 00:35:50.598]  And so now the Border Patrol is so depressed knowing they're turning children over to smugglers.
[00:35:52.719 --> 00:35:55.840]  That's what Jack Posobiec asked George Ramos.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.401]  Amnesty for illegal migrants?
[00:35:58.441 --> 00:35:59.601]  Nothing we can do to stop them?
[00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:02.242]  I don't support child trafficking cartels, Frank.
[00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:02.842]  Do you?
[00:36:04.503 --> 00:36:05.323]  And the Senate report
[00:36:07.529 --> 00:36:13.894]  Even the Washington Post, last year, thousands of children went into trafficking and disappeared under Obama, having them loaded on buses.
[00:36:14.254 --> 00:36:16.075]  It was Obama created the incentive.
[00:36:17.096 --> 00:36:21.119]  It was Obama said, you get here, you're quote, a child, we let you in.
[00:36:21.239 --> 00:36:23.021]  That meant to have a child with you.
[00:36:23.621 --> 00:36:26.063]  Like a homeless person always has some starving dog.
[00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:30.026]  So they can get more money at the side of the sidewalk.
[00:36:31.027 --> 00:36:35.330]  I pulled in the other day to a little corner restaurant to eat some lunch.
[00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.611]  I was working up here on Saturday.
[00:36:38.624 --> 00:36:42.327]  Well, I sat there about an hour doing business on my phone and eating.
[00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:43.028]  I took my time.
[00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:46.451]  I watched two different corners run by some pimp.
[00:36:46.691 --> 00:36:47.712]  I guess a pimp over it.
[00:36:48.593 --> 00:36:53.017]  And the women would come over and both of them had little dogs and they'd slap the dog if it did anything.
[00:36:54.013 --> 00:37:17.467]  I haven't videotaped some of it and she'd sit there and give him the money and then she'd get in the car and obviously smoke some crack or whatever is her payment because a woman gets more than a man and a woman with a dog it was bingo bingo bingo it was like a cash machine at the corner over here by the office there's a shanty town under the road feces some piles of feces just drip off now
[00:37:18.285 --> 00:37:19.465]  Just run onto the street.
[00:37:19.565 --> 00:37:20.805]  There's just urine everywhere.
[00:37:21.146 --> 00:37:26.287]  Every day I drive to work, I get to turn into the underpass and drive by and just see the feces everywhere.
[00:37:26.547 --> 00:37:27.967]  Those are the real homeless people.
[00:37:28.007 --> 00:37:34.848]  Just big piles of stinking newspapers and sleeping bags.
[00:37:37.189 --> 00:37:39.689]  And they're all just like schizophrenics whacked out of their brain.
[00:37:39.709 --> 00:37:41.509]  Five or six of them sleeping in just one little pile.
[00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.030]  But then you've got the more professionals.
[00:37:44.855 --> 00:37:51.381]  And they're out there with their little dog, and they've got the woman out there, and then she goes over and gives him the pile of money.
[00:37:52.002 --> 00:37:54.204]  And she's whacked out of her brain to know what planet she's on.
[00:37:54.644 --> 00:37:57.747]  He gives her a little something, and she runs around and gets in the back of the car.
[00:37:57.767 --> 00:37:58.508]  He can tell what she's doing.
[00:37:58.528 --> 00:38:02.551]  And then ten minutes later, she gets out and bows to him.
[00:38:03.792 --> 00:38:04.893]  And then he just goes, get!
[00:38:05.414 --> 00:38:08.457]  And then she runs back over a couple hundred yards.
[00:38:10.097 --> 00:38:13.739]  About 100 yards to the street corner and these people just cash machine her.
[00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:15.580]  Just cash, cash, cash.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.421]  Almost every car, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash.
[00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:19.442]  Because she's got the dog.
[00:38:19.462 --> 00:38:23.124]  It's the same thing.
[00:38:23.164 --> 00:38:24.104]  We have the children!
[00:38:24.184 --> 00:38:24.805]  Open the gates!
[00:38:25.225 --> 00:38:25.405]  Ah!
[00:38:25.425 --> 00:38:27.226]  In fact, that even happened in Guatemala.
[00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:31.648]  Is that men would run forward with a baby to the riot police going, ah!
[00:38:32.048 --> 00:38:35.090]  Using the child as a human shield and the Mexican police would stand down.
[00:38:37.984 --> 00:38:39.184]  And that's what we've become.
[00:38:39.264 --> 00:38:40.125]  That's who we are.
[00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:43.446]  Meanwhile, the Democrats want to kill every damn baby they can before they're born.
[00:38:44.566 --> 00:38:51.009]  And they're anti-Christian, and they're demoralizing this country, and they know exactly what they've done in a big, big way.
[00:38:51.569 --> 00:38:53.790]  Let's roll some of this footage again for TV viewers.
[00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.110]  Shock video.
[00:38:55.190 --> 00:39:01.753]  Migrants drag screaming children, you mean illegal alien invaders, underwater through Constantino wire to enter the U.S.
[00:39:01.813 --> 00:39:02.193]  illegally.
[00:39:03.693 --> 00:39:05.414]  First, they taught us not to call them illegal.
[00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:10.919]  Then they taught us to, you know, just bow down if they have a child with them.
[00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:12.640]  And now we've just totally capitulated.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.181]  We've given up.
[00:39:13.341 --> 00:39:14.322]  We've run the white flag up.
[00:39:14.722 --> 00:39:16.423]  And Trump couldn't get the funding he wanted.
[00:39:17.484 --> 00:39:21.647]  You know, he wanted 10 billion extra dollars for security and for the wall.
[00:39:21.687 --> 00:39:22.268]  But you know what?
[00:39:22.308 --> 00:39:23.028]  He didn't get that.
[00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:24.810]  He got a billion three.
[00:39:26.075 --> 00:39:26.916]  And now this is it.
[00:39:26.936 --> 00:39:29.397]  It just encourages a mass stampede.
[00:39:30.018 --> 00:39:34.761]  Like you see Black Friday stampedes where people get hurt or killed trying to get a washing machine or a PlayStation.
[00:39:35.182 --> 00:39:36.142]  Well, this is worse than that.
[00:39:36.162 --> 00:39:37.443]  It's just billions of people.
[00:39:37.703 --> 00:39:38.504]  They want to come here.
[00:39:38.804 --> 00:39:39.845]  There's a big UN report.
[00:39:40.165 --> 00:39:43.587]  20 plus percent of the illegal aliens in the world live in the U.S.
[00:39:44.668 --> 00:39:46.630]  That's out of 6 billion third world people.
[00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.011]  20 percent now live here.
[00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:49.332]  We are the third world.
[00:39:49.572 --> 00:39:50.592]  We are falling apart.
[00:39:50.793 --> 00:39:51.773]  We are bankrupting.
[00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:53.034]  We are degenerating.
[00:39:53.314 --> 00:39:53.855]  It's happening.
[00:39:55.549 --> 00:39:56.129]  Shock video!
[00:39:56.169 --> 00:40:00.192]  Migrants drag screaming children underwater through Constantino wire to enter the U.S.
[00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:00.653]  illegally.
[00:40:00.713 --> 00:40:02.474]  But they got the little kids, so it's okay.
[00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:05.776]  Disturbing video of illegal immigrants defying U.S.
[00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:12.161]  border agents to push screaming children underwater through razor wire to American officers.
[00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:15.823]  Latest evidence of the chaos of the border Democrats continue to ignore.
[00:40:16.003 --> 00:40:17.965]  They're not ignoring it, American Mirror.
[00:40:19.186 --> 00:40:20.807]  They said, come on up!
[00:40:21.727 --> 00:40:23.749]  They turned the red light on to screw America.
[00:40:24.619 --> 00:40:30.063]  In one video, illegal immigrants pulled young children under the border fence through large coils of concertina wire.
[00:40:30.103 --> 00:40:31.904]  You can see kids' faces are bleeding.
[00:40:32.505 --> 00:40:35.947]  During a cold December morning in Yuma, Arizona, this video has been released.
[00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:36.588]  This was last year.
[00:40:37.028 --> 00:40:44.033]  The video shows several adults crawling and hoisting about half a dozen youngsters, little babies, through a barbed wire barrier.
[00:40:44.153 --> 00:40:44.374]  U.S.
[00:40:44.414 --> 00:40:49.657]  Border Patrol urged them to reconsider as they repeatedly snagged their clothes on the wire.
[00:40:49.958 --> 00:40:52.239]  The traumatic experience punctuated
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.043]  By blaring sirens and flashing police lights.
[00:40:57.844 --> 00:41:02.288]  Oh, but they're not the bad people taking their kids through this or whoever's kids they kidnapped.
[00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:03.630]  No, no, no.
[00:41:05.071 --> 00:41:11.637]  We are, and we are importing the worst of the worst from an already collapsed and dangerous as hell third world.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.982]  And when they get here, they vote almost 100% Democrat Party.
[00:41:18.563 --> 00:41:21.125]  The ones that did this and engineered this.
[00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:25.409]  And it is just a real shame how they use these poor people to do this.
[00:41:25.429 --> 00:41:27.110]  All right, we're going to go on a break.
[00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.791]  We're going to keep fighting, but here's the bottom line.
[00:41:29.692 --> 00:41:30.633]  I don't say this to be negative.
[00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:32.514]  We've stabilized the country in some ways.
[00:41:32.534 --> 00:41:33.395]  Trump knew this was coming.
[00:41:33.675 --> 00:41:35.337]  He was unable to get congressional funding to do it all.
[00:41:37.136 --> 00:41:45.738]  We have to understand the Democratic Party are globalist, seditious traitors, hell-bent on overthrowing the nation, and start regarding them as that, and responding to them as that.
[00:41:46.078 --> 00:41:47.159]  And they've got to be dealt with.
[00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:54.021]  And the military, and the government, and the police, and everybody else, the general public, have to recognize this country is collapsing.
[00:41:54.361 --> 00:42:01.523]  And now, in these latest waves that are twice the size they were last year, three times bigger than anything we've ever been hit with, they'll be ten times this by 2020.
[00:42:01.563 --> 00:42:01.803]  You watch.
[00:42:03.323 --> 00:42:14.286]  You watch, it's going to be so hellish, and so horrific, and so out of control, that you're going to have many cities burning with rioters, just like Venezuela, just like Colombia, and just like Brazil.
[00:42:14.526 --> 00:42:16.587]  Because, again, we have the videos today.
[00:42:16.927 --> 00:42:18.568]  They are assaulting those borders too.
[00:42:19.148 --> 00:42:19.948]  And what are they fleeing?
[00:42:20.308 --> 00:42:21.048]  Socialism.
[00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:22.649]  Communism.
[00:42:24.009 --> 00:42:29.071]  But they're flooding back where the Socialists and Communists have gotten control again, and are offering more freebies.
[00:42:30.026 --> 00:42:32.088]  And these aren't Mexican migrants coming in now.
[00:42:32.288 --> 00:42:32.709]  No, no, no.
[00:42:33.049 --> 00:42:36.452]  The Mexicans have learned how to make money off of them and tax them as they come up.
[00:42:36.933 --> 00:42:44.000]  These are people that are leaving communism, leaving socialism, to come up here and get the new big free deal.
[00:42:45.697 --> 00:42:46.158]  That's it!
[00:42:46.758 --> 00:42:49.983]  When I was out at the Beto O'Rourke, half the shirts said Democratic Socialism.
[00:42:50.464 --> 00:42:51.485]  They're coming, folks!
[00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:54.749]  And they're gonna vote your money, your guns, and your children away!
[00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.211]  This is war!
[00:42:56.572 --> 00:42:59.416]  The Democrats are killing the country right now!
[00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:00.818]  They are literally the enemy!
[00:43:02.745 --> 00:43:09.408]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:43:09.588 --> 00:43:10.668]  My name is Blackberry.
[00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:12.289]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:14.990]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[00:43:15.391 --> 00:43:19.052]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[00:43:19.452 --> 00:43:23.034]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:43:23.114 --> 00:43:24.354]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:43:24.495 --> 00:43:29.557]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[00:43:29.577 --> 00:43:30.757]  Are you nervous?
[00:43:30.797 --> 00:43:30.857]  Yes.
[00:43:31.398 --> 00:43:32.138]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:33.348]  No.
[00:43:34.068 --> 00:43:39.450]  And for the children and the people that support it are gonna realize that this is gonna be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:45.072]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable just seeing it.
[00:43:45.272 --> 00:43:47.013]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[00:43:47.073 --> 00:43:47.753]  And shake your butts!
[00:43:47.773 --> 00:43:48.994]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[00:44:21.994 --> 00:44:25.118]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:44:25.138 --> 00:44:30.284]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:44:30.304 --> 00:44:32.767]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:44:32.907 --> 00:44:34.169]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[00:44:34.249 --> 00:44:35.130]  Are you nervous?
[00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.370]  Yes.
[00:44:39.054 --> 00:44:40.194]  They were all accepting.
[00:44:40.234 --> 00:44:44.676]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[00:44:44.836 --> 00:44:47.437]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[00:44:47.457 --> 00:44:48.538]  A stardom young, right?
[00:44:48.818 --> 00:44:50.218]  A stardom young, right?
[00:44:50.318 --> 00:44:53.580]  When the woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs, it's a man.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.141]  This is adult entertainment.
[00:44:56.842 --> 00:44:57.902]  But what do predators do?
[00:44:57.942 --> 00:44:59.063]  They target children.
[00:44:59.203 --> 00:45:08.510]  Breaking news, we have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston public library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:17.215]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[00:45:17.556 --> 00:45:20.798]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[00:45:21.058 --> 00:45:23.880]  This is Tatiana Valinia, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.562]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[00:45:26.962 --> 00:45:34.127]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[00:45:34.187 --> 00:45:36.768]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[00:45:36.988 --> 00:45:38.950]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:43.052]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[00:45:43.092 --> 00:45:47.956]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[00:45:48.536 --> 00:45:54.444]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?!
[00:45:55.004 --> 00:45:56.486]  What planet did I wake up in?! !
[00:46:02.788 --> 00:46:07.733]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[00:46:07.873 --> 00:46:10.756]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[00:46:10.776 --> 00:46:12.738]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.

[00:47:05.969 --> 00:47:08.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:01.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.641]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I intend to open the phones up in the second and third hour the entire time.
[00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:08.002]  So get ready, I'll be taking your phone calls.
[00:48:08.022 --> 00:48:10.302]  I'll give the number out the start of the next hour.
[00:48:10.322 --> 00:48:18.645]  I cannot stress to you enough how huge it is, how insane it is, how out of control it is.
[00:48:20.421 --> 00:48:29.226]  That you've got the Chinese, the Russians, and others in Venezuela trying to have some type of influence over who gets into power there to control that oil.
[00:48:29.246 --> 00:48:43.013]  When the bigger issue is Venezuela is being collapsed into Central and North America with UN centers built to flood us with the illegal alien hordes.
[00:48:44.874 --> 00:48:49.177]  So I hope the Pentagon and the President aren't distracted over the oil.
[00:48:51.493 --> 00:49:12.917]  But I talked about this yesterday and then I never got to it because I wanted to basically spell it out properly and it's a very complex issue because I don't just endorse invasions or war lightly and I'm not even saying I fully endorse it but I think we're moving into that area where it's actually in our interest and needs to be done.
[00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:15.021]  Not over the oil.
[00:49:15.882 --> 00:49:17.862]  Over the fact that the U.N.
[00:49:17.902 --> 00:49:21.704]  runs Venezuela and they are collapsing it to collapse the United States.
[00:49:22.344 --> 00:49:26.266]  And that now the majority of people heading us are not even from Central America.
[00:49:26.286 --> 00:49:27.746]  They're from Venezuela and Colombia.
[00:49:27.766 --> 00:49:34.269]  Because some people are joining the Venezuelans as they go through Colombia.
[00:49:34.729 --> 00:49:36.289]  Some of the Colombians are joining them.
[00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:40.831]  So this crisis is spiraling out of control very, very quickly.
[00:49:42.231 --> 00:49:43.012]  And quite frankly,
[00:49:46.334 --> 00:49:59.769]  I'm going to air a few clips here that I wanted to play anyways, regardless, and then I'm going to try to focus my mind and give the analysis that needs to be given because I know not just the public listens, but a lot of people in the government listen.
[00:50:00.592 --> 00:50:03.154]  For whatever reason, we've proven we've got a pretty good handle on things.
[00:50:03.614 --> 00:50:07.597]  And I'm just going to try to put out to the public what other people are saying and doing and thinking.
[00:50:07.617 --> 00:50:16.684]  Because I guarantee you, what you're going to hear from me is exactly what's being discussed by patriots that are in the Pentagon and other areas of intelligence agencies who aren't globalist.
[00:50:17.324 --> 00:50:21.247]  But this country is in such peril right now that I can't even believe it, quite frankly.
[00:50:22.328 --> 00:50:27.472]  And that's really the paradox, is if you study times like World War II,
[00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:34.381]  A lot of people didn't get out of Austria or Germany or Czechoslovakia or Poland or France when they had a chance to.
[00:50:35.422 --> 00:50:36.962]  Only when it was too late they tried to get out.
[00:50:38.163 --> 00:50:46.026]  And what I'm getting at is people don't normally recognize historically how dangerous something is until it's already run them over.
[00:50:48.007 --> 00:50:50.388]  And things are so bad.
[00:50:51.308 --> 00:50:54.730]  Things are good that we're waking up, but things are so bad geopolitically.
[00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.391]  And this country is under such globalist assault.
[00:50:59.369 --> 00:51:04.411]  That the President has to act decisively.
[00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:05.852]  And you can't just build a wall.
[00:51:06.672 --> 00:51:08.813]  You have to stop the countries under UN control.
[00:51:09.994 --> 00:51:12.935]  You have to stop the globalist-influenced countries like Mexico and Venezuela.
[00:51:13.315 --> 00:51:16.517]  Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela are the problems.
[00:51:17.737 --> 00:51:20.879]  Places like Colombia and Brazil are the solutions.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.181]  And Colombia is already threatening to go to war with Venezuela right now.
[00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:29.442]  Because they're being crapped on.
[00:51:29.482 --> 00:51:30.283]  They're being overwhelmed.
[00:51:30.303 --> 00:51:32.164]  They're having their economy destroyed.
[00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:33.185]  They're being invaded.
[00:51:34.045 --> 00:51:39.689]  And when you get invaded by a government throwing its port at you, you take that government out or you collapse.
[00:51:40.289 --> 00:51:41.510]  We're the ones under attack.
[00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.932]  Colombia, Brazil, the United States.
[00:51:45.868 --> 00:51:49.831]  Mexico says, hey, you do whatever you want, as long as you go up north and piss on America.
[00:51:49.851 --> 00:51:58.056]  And meanwhile, the South American and Central American gangs that are there now aren't following Mexico's rules, and you've got cartel wars everywhere!
[00:52:01.398 --> 00:52:07.002]  So again, Central and South America and Southern North America are descending into bedlam.
[00:52:10.779 --> 00:52:15.442]  The Border Patrol has said, red alert, SOS, our border is collapsing.
[00:52:15.742 --> 00:52:16.203]  It's gone.
[00:52:17.743 --> 00:52:18.544]  That was the plan.
[00:52:18.704 --> 00:52:20.125]  Overwhelm the courts.
[00:52:21.446 --> 00:52:23.327]  Overwhelm Border Patrol and ICE.
[00:52:24.868 --> 00:52:26.049]  Overwhelm law enforcement.
[00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.272]  That's the ether in which socialists and globalists swim.
[00:52:31.412 --> 00:52:33.614]  They're always in armored compounds with private security.
[00:52:34.414 --> 00:52:36.916]  And out of this fall of civilization, they gain control.
[00:52:40.492 --> 00:52:42.433]  The Democrats are saying we should have no border.
[00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:43.014]  Beto.
[00:52:44.815 --> 00:52:45.516]  George Ramos.
[00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:46.016]  All of them.
[00:52:46.817 --> 00:52:51.580]  That's an enemy that says your country shouldn't have a border and come on up here and America sucks.
[00:52:53.021 --> 00:52:53.962]  But they hate America.
[00:52:54.002 --> 00:52:55.203]  That's who these globalists are.
[00:52:56.864 --> 00:52:59.826]  And we have to stop lying to ourselves about how bad they are.
[00:53:00.967 --> 00:53:02.428]  And how out of control they are.
[00:53:04.029 --> 00:53:06.091]  And how incredibly evil they are.
[00:53:11.394 --> 00:53:14.917]  We have to face up to, nobody can beat the U.S.
[00:53:14.937 --> 00:53:19.780]  with a bunch of planes and tanks and ships, but they can beat us culturally and use our openness to infiltrate us.
[00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:25.364]  And they can use our open society and how loving we are to pull on our heartstrings.
[00:53:25.524 --> 00:53:35.872]  And they can use our 2,200 mile southern border that is backed up against a chain of third world nations that run the gambit from bad to worse.
[00:53:37.393 --> 00:53:40.315]  So you care about your kids, you care about prosperity, I don't care what color you are.
[00:53:41.423 --> 00:53:49.665]  You better understand, folks, that the worst of South and Central America are being literally crapped onto us right now.
[00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:53.846]  Children are being kidnapped and smuggled.
[00:53:53.966 --> 00:53:56.666]  Women are being kidnapped and smuggled in a gargantuan level.
[00:53:56.946 --> 00:53:59.867]  And if we have a broken border, folks, we'll have a broken country.
[00:53:59.887 --> 00:54:02.828]  And already, most areas of South Texas are becoming unlivable.
[00:54:03.428 --> 00:54:05.368]  Many areas of California are becoming unlivable.
[00:54:05.588 --> 00:54:06.748]  Many areas of Arizona, unlivable.
[00:54:06.828 --> 00:54:08.249]  We are in collapse.
[00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:09.629]  Let's not lie about it.
[00:54:12.108 --> 00:54:15.509]  Got a bunch of clips of that coming up in the next hour with your calls, but I want you to understand something.
[00:54:16.409 --> 00:54:23.572]  I'm not at liberty to get into this yet, but I've learned what the Democratic Mafia, the Democrat Mafia, is doing to us to shut us down behind the scenes.
[00:54:24.652 --> 00:54:27.173]  And their plans have fallen into our hands just as of late.
[00:54:28.434 --> 00:54:30.754]  And when you come face to face with these people, you don't have fear.
[00:54:31.595 --> 00:54:34.676]  You only have concern that you're not going to do a good enough job stopping them.
[00:54:35.676 --> 00:54:37.837]  We're dealing with pure scum evil.
[00:54:39.226 --> 00:54:42.449]  That has no conscience and a will to dominate you and your family.
[00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.673]  You think the hunchback Democrats like you, that you're strong and good?
[00:54:45.733 --> 00:54:46.574]  They hate you.
[00:54:49.457 --> 00:54:50.618]  They hate your guts.
[00:54:50.818 --> 00:54:56.344]  Every stinking Democrat leader has been now picked to be an anti-American enemy.
[00:54:58.157 --> 00:55:00.558]  And they're making their move with the scumbag mainstream media.
[00:55:00.958 --> 00:55:08.181]  So all I'm telling you is support our local Aminathem affiliates that see through the propaganda of the globalists that don't buy their bull and are putting this broadcast out.
[00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:08.721]  Support them!
[00:55:09.221 --> 00:55:09.802]  Get it done!
[00:55:10.382 --> 00:55:16.364]  And all of you, take with this whoever that did this in Houston, put up a billboard for our super blue fluoride-free toothpaste that's so good.
[00:55:16.664 --> 00:55:17.665]  That supports the Infowar.
[00:55:17.705 --> 00:55:23.507]  However you do it, spread the word because the enemy knows the spirit of 1776 lives here.
[00:55:24.467 --> 00:55:25.588]  Right here in Texas.
[00:55:27.568 --> 00:55:29.891]  And it lives in your heart, it lives in your mind as well.
[00:55:30.792 --> 00:55:38.041]  And I want to encourage everybody to take advantage of this big mega sale that's got to end by tomorrow or the next day at the latest, because we're selling out some of these great items.

[00:56:07.053 --> 00:56:07.934]  It's so important.

[00:56:17.525 --> 00:56:19.887]  Go read the tens of thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:56:20.328 --> 00:56:22.089]  Go learn about how great these products are.
[00:56:22.149 --> 00:56:23.150]  Fish Oil's selling out.
[00:56:25.191 --> 00:56:26.372]  Knock out the great Sleep Aid.
[00:56:26.773 --> 00:56:27.473]  It's selling out.
[00:56:27.653 --> 00:56:30.977]  They're all there at Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:31.517 --> 00:56:33.879]  And you've got this commitment from me.
[00:56:34.039 --> 00:56:37.523]  I'm going to fight and stand and take action at the very end.
[00:56:38.143 --> 00:56:40.586]  You know, we've got a product, DNA Force Plus.
[00:56:41.066 --> 00:56:43.428]  Every time you reformulate, you've got to change the name, so we call it Plus.
[00:56:43.889 --> 00:56:44.850]  Even stronger and better.
[00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:46.992]  Signed a big multi-year contract.
[00:56:48.305 --> 00:56:56.175]  Got a lot better deal on the PQQ and the CoQ10 and all the things that have been patented and proven to slow the shrinkage of telomeres.
[00:56:56.195 --> 00:56:58.157]  Well, it's the same thing as making them last longer.
[00:56:59.273 --> 00:57:03.654]  And the nerve regrowth and just everything for yourselves.
[00:57:03.954 --> 00:57:13.556]  When I forget to take this, which I do routinely because it ends up selling out for months and I don't have it on auto ship, I just take it home and I forget to take it, I don't have the energy, the stamina, any of it.
[00:57:14.216 --> 00:57:17.057]  It's just, it's all of these, everything I bring you is a missing link.
[00:57:17.097 --> 00:57:22.078]  The X2, the DNA Force Plus, but at 60% off, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57:23.386 --> 00:57:26.207]  It is 200-300% below what leading competitors sell it for.
[00:57:26.227 --> 00:57:27.728]  Because that's the rule in supplements.
[00:57:27.808 --> 00:57:29.448]  Everybody else marks them up 5-7 times.
[00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.629]  We mark up 150%.
[00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:39.432]  So, at $59.80, very expensive ingredients, you're looking at something, gosh, barely even marked up anything.
[00:57:40.112 --> 00:57:41.053]  Almost a lost leader.
[00:57:41.073 --> 00:57:41.953]  So take advantage of it.
[00:57:41.993 --> 00:57:45.294]  Read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com of DNA Force Plus.
[00:57:45.434 --> 00:57:47.755]  Read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:47.775 --> 00:57:48.695]  Please just do that.
[00:57:48.936 --> 00:57:49.496]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.516 --> 00:57:49.896]  Stay with us.
[00:57:53.348 --> 00:57:53.988]  It's incredible.
[00:57:54.448 --> 00:57:57.309]  We're fighting back and we're winning thanks to you.
[00:57:58.009 --> 00:58:01.410]  I've got some good news for you folks, but some bad news for the globalists.
[00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:07.071]  I've got good news for the people of America and the people of the world.
[00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:13.112]  Trump has been totally exonerated from the entire Russian gay attempted coup d'etat takedown.
[00:58:13.872 --> 00:58:17.873]  And now he's going on the offense with the big executive order of a week ago
[00:58:19.216 --> 00:58:25.658]  Trump said the meeting went well and the word is Apple and Facebook and Twitter, they're all being
[00:58:43.917 --> 00:58:49.622]  Talked to by the President over the telephone, and private meetings are being set up where he's going to lay down the law.
[00:58:50.103 --> 00:59:00.452]  That they're not going to side with authoritarian foreign powers, and that they're going to either abide by the Constitution and Bill of Rights and not be authoritarians, or he's going to take action against them.
[00:59:00.772 --> 00:59:02.774]  That is everything we've needed to hear.
[00:59:03.214 --> 00:59:04.976]  Now let's make sure the President follows through.
[00:59:05.476 --> 00:59:06.878]  Now, InfoWars, as you know,
[00:59:07.478 --> 00:59:09.741]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last few days of the sale.

[00:59:31.679 --> 00:59:37.601]  There's only at least four or five days left in this Super Sale at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:59:45.863 --> 00:59:46.863]  A total 360 win.
[00:59:47.143 --> 00:59:48.443]  The same for the First Amendment.
[00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:51.444]  Super Sale at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:51.744 --> 00:59:52.544]  Only a few days left.
[00:59:54.679 --> 00:59:58.793]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.315 --> 01:00:00.620]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:35.713]  We're literally watching the globalist attempt to collapse nation-states.
[01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:39.837]  Beto, the UN puppet, reinforces US downfall literally.
[01:00:39.857 --> 01:00:40.277]  Here it is.
[01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:49.145]  The UN, funded by elements of our own government and stay-behind groups put in power by Hillary and Obama,
[01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:58.842]  Help collapse Europe with the help of the EU, with over 10 million military-age men the last seven years, to where Europe is just wrecked.
[01:00:59.463 --> 01:01:05.868]  80 plus percent less terrorism, crime rates off the charts, just bedlam.
[01:01:06.408 --> 01:01:12.853]  Thousands of cars burned per week, hundreds per night, mass stabbings, sex slavery.
[01:01:14.494 --> 01:01:17.777]  The third world in many areas is hell.
[01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:25.576]  And we're in an existential threat crisis here.
[01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:40.306]  And just as they ran the same operation with North African and Middle Easterners and others, I guess Europe in the last seven, eight years, the exact same people are running an attempt with not one, but two caravans of over 40,000.
[01:01:40.707 --> 01:01:42.628]  Now the government's saying 40,000.
[01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.470]  They were saying it was 1,000 before and it was 50,000.
[01:01:48.263 --> 01:01:54.425]  And Beto O'Rourke is there as a literal treasonous traitor, organizing it and bragging that it's happening.
[01:01:54.925 --> 01:01:57.166]  People are coming across not being tested for diseases.
[01:01:57.486 --> 01:01:59.307]  They've been caught smuggling children in mass.
[01:01:59.927 --> 01:02:01.328]  This is insanity.
[01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:04.949]  Families, including 40,000 children, expected to enter the process this month.
[01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:10.651]  We are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a CBP facility.
[01:02:10.671 --> 01:02:16.493]  But with these numbers, with the types of illnesses we're seeing at the border, I fear that it's just a matter of time.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.082]  But it's designed to bring the country down.
[01:02:19.622 --> 01:02:22.786]  And you've got that backdrop with the deep state trying to overthrow Trump.
[01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:29.033]  All Trump is doing is the basic default that anybody would do to keep the country from collapsing.
[01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.856]  But it's not enough because the attack's been launched.
[01:02:33.858 --> 01:02:36.481]  And Trump can't get the laws or the funding to stop it.
[01:02:37.785 --> 01:02:44.195]  And once they overwhelm the courts, and once they overwhelm the detention facilities, it's over.
[01:02:44.896 --> 01:02:48.301]  You'll have 10 million people in the next year come in.
[01:02:49.062 --> 01:02:53.288]  It was a million and a half illegals they know of last year, probably 4 million they don't.
[01:02:54.209 --> 01:02:58.333]  10 million is now estimated will pour in this year.
[01:02:58.353 --> 01:03:00.135]  10 million people.
[01:03:00.215 --> 01:03:06.160]  I'll tell you, if it was under 1,000 apprehensions the day before, that was a relatively good number.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:11.664]  And if it was above 1,000, it was a relatively bad number, and I was going to be in a bad mood the whole day.
[01:03:12.325 --> 01:03:14.247]  On Tuesday, there were 4,000 apprehensions.
[01:03:16.028 --> 01:03:18.048]  I know that 1,000 overwhelms the system.
[01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:21.069]  I cannot begin to imagine what 4,000 a day looks like.
[01:03:21.149 --> 01:03:23.550]  So we are truly in a crisis.
[01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:32.652]  And there is a crime culture, an MS-13, and a smuggling culture, and all the lawlessness you see in Latin America is now here.
[01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.332]  And that's exactly what's happening here.
[01:03:35.352 --> 01:03:42.254]  Floods of crime, floods of disease, and the UN funding it all to overwhelm the beds.
[01:03:44.295 --> 01:03:51.919]  The Democrats wanted in the latest budget plan a cap at 16,700 beds.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, some estimates are 50,000 people are hitting the border a day.
[01:03:58.882 --> 01:04:03.425]  1.5 million illegals got apprehended last year.
[01:04:04.582 --> 01:04:04.982]  Look it up.
[01:04:05.122 --> 01:04:06.503]  Millions more they don't know.
[01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:12.544]  Now, there are two caravans of over 40,000 people, it's estimated, set to smash into the U.S.
[01:04:12.624 --> 01:04:13.504]  in about two weeks.
[01:04:13.925 --> 01:04:15.285]  They're being trucked up, most of them.
[01:04:16.525 --> 01:04:17.986]  Almost all of military-age men.
[01:04:18.026 --> 01:04:21.967]  But the traitor media will go show a few women that are in the crowd to pull on heartstrings.
[01:04:22.267 --> 01:04:27.728]  When they collapse the courts and collapse law enforcement and the border, it's over.
[01:04:28.529 --> 01:04:29.669]  Like Europe, it's broken.
[01:04:31.444 --> 01:04:33.626]  10 million in Europe the last seven years.
[01:04:33.986 --> 01:04:35.488]  Almost all military-age men.
[01:04:36.488 --> 01:04:40.832]  We're about to see 10 million, it's estimated, in the next 12 months.
[01:04:40.912 --> 01:04:41.633]  Not fiscal year 2019.
[01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:45.616]  The Border Patrol put out statements, they said, in the next 12 months.
[01:04:48.498 --> 01:04:52.642]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:04:53.403 --> 01:04:54.924]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.425 --> 01:05:03.845]  Stress?
[01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:05.726]  I mean, I've explained this.
[01:05:06.046 --> 01:05:17.751]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of social media last year, saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state, and just said I did it.
[01:05:19.071 --> 01:05:25.314]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted it, but the damage was done.
[01:05:26.768 --> 01:05:43.357]  But if you think I'm going to sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:47.079]  And so the letters are going to be sent out Monday.
[01:05:47.947 --> 01:05:51.569]  I've already got the lawyers engaged, and we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:53.890]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:56.692]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[01:05:58.153 --> 01:05:59.594]  All I have is you supporting us.
[01:06:00.674 --> 01:06:01.315]  That's all I have.
[01:06:15.396 --> 01:06:19.418]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:20.199 --> 01:06:21.660]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.041]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:23.561 --> 01:06:28.304]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:34.487 --> 01:06:40.411]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:41.687 --> 01:06:44.530]  Words cannot describe how serious our crisis is.
[01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:46.551]  It's the perfect invasion.
[01:06:46.792 --> 01:06:48.273]  It's the perfect takedown of the culture.
[01:06:48.693 --> 01:06:51.075]  It's the perfect system to steal elections.
[01:06:51.596 --> 01:06:54.118]  The perfect soft kill operation.
[01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:57.261]  The globalists have exploited and looted Latin America.
[01:06:58.301 --> 01:06:59.663]  They've exploited and looted the Middle East.
[01:07:00.443 --> 01:07:01.764]  They then create land bridges.
[01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:08.991]  They create UN refugee centers to mass the disenfranchised populations, to propagandize them, in some cases for a year.
[01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:14.141]  Before they are sent forward with debit cards paid for by U.S.
[01:07:14.181 --> 01:07:32.789]  taxpayer money, fenced by George Soros, Democratic Party phone numbers, Catholic charity phone numbers, and other information to get up to the United States and then be disappeared into the system, showing up as people voting in the names of dead voters.
[01:07:35.003 --> 01:07:36.525]  It's a total takeover plan.
[01:07:36.605 --> 01:07:39.568]  And remember Obama, I'm letting kids come into the U.S.
[01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.391]  We're just letting kids, unaccompanied kids.
[01:07:43.372 --> 01:07:45.174]  Only 17% were under the age of 18.
[01:07:45.254 --> 01:07:48.758]  It was just an invasion of adults.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.864]  Remember when the Border Patrol bought 30-something thousand pairs of 6X underwear?
[01:07:55.166 --> 01:08:02.150]  So many obese people, they needed thousands and thousands of pairs of 6X underwear.
[01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:07.213]  I got a pair of 6X underwear from Walmart on air, famously, and showed how big they were.
[01:08:08.894 --> 01:08:11.115]  Three and a half feet across, unstretched.
[01:08:11.135 --> 01:08:15.197]  You can just Google Alex Jones puts underwear on his head, I made a joke out of it.
[01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:18.039]  Knowing, making a meme out of it, we would reach young people.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.702]  Yes, I fall on the sword every day, ladies and gentlemen, with different little tricks I've learned to get the truth out.
[01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:26.250]  But this is just insane.
[01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:37.834]  And now we've got Venezuela collapsing, thousands starving a week, into Colombia, on their way to Central America and the United States.
[01:08:39.575 --> 01:08:41.655]  And it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:43.056 --> 01:08:44.496]  So what do we do about this?
[01:08:44.896 --> 01:08:50.738]  I want to hear from Law Enforcement, Military, Border Patrol, in the first round of calls.
[01:08:52.335 --> 01:08:55.518]  Former Border Patrol, current Border Patrol, ICE, U.S.
[01:08:55.558 --> 01:08:59.641]  Customs, law enforcement, military that have worked borders in other parts of the world.
[01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:00.242]  What do we do?
[01:09:01.383 --> 01:09:03.524]  People say, well, the President ought to just turn them back.
[01:09:03.705 --> 01:09:09.509]  Under law, if they get over the wall, they have to be given to judges, mainly that are globalists.
[01:09:10.951 --> 01:09:13.513]  And the average waits six years to see a judge now.
[01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:14.554]  Well, it was four years.
[01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:19.218]  Fifteen thousand are slamming in to places like El Paso a day and being caught.
[01:09:20.148 --> 01:09:20.909]  That's just being caught.
[01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:23.811]  The Border Patrol said the previous record there was 3,000.
[01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:28.034]  That's a John Bounds report on it.
[01:09:28.474 --> 01:09:29.175]  That aired Sunday.
[01:09:30.095 --> 01:09:32.297]  You're not seeing this on the national news though, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:32.997 --> 01:09:34.779]  You'll see, oh look, they're going through barbed wire.
[01:09:34.839 --> 01:09:35.499]  Isn't it mean?
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.560]  With their babies.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.182]  Yeah, if you did that with your kid, they'd take your kid!
[01:09:39.382 --> 01:09:40.423]  That's child endangerment!
[01:09:44.244 --> 01:09:48.428]  The woman that brought her kid up where they said Trump was mean to the girl and they photoshopped him standing over her.
[01:09:48.708 --> 01:09:50.430]  She'd been in the desert for a hundred and something miles.
[01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:51.151]  She was starving.
[01:09:51.451 --> 01:09:54.654]  She was about to pass out from heat exposure and dehydration.
[01:09:54.835 --> 01:09:57.597]  Turned out her mother uses her as a human shield to get into the U.S.
[01:09:57.637 --> 01:09:59.780]  routinely, her former husband said.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.083]  I wonder what else she's doing when she's coming up here.
[01:10:05.595 --> 01:10:09.338]  And they blamed Trump and said the child was taken from her, never was done.
[01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:10.639]  All lies.
[01:10:10.879 --> 01:10:12.039]  Like Kavanaugh's hoax.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.180]  Against him.
[01:10:13.621 --> 01:10:15.062]  Or the Covington Kid hoax.
[01:10:15.482 --> 01:10:18.024]  Or the hoax about what I really said about Sandy Hook.
[01:10:18.104 --> 01:10:19.665]  Or the hoax about Smollett.
[01:10:19.865 --> 01:10:21.066]  Or the hoax about Russiagate.
[01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:27.750]  And I'm pretty wound up today because I've gotten proof of what the Democrats are doing behind the scenes.
[01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:30.172]  You know, they haven't stopped their Russiagate stuff.
[01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:34.642]  They haven't stopped the Russiagate stuff.
[01:10:35.323 --> 01:10:47.550]  They go around to people in business, in my life, and banks, and lawyers, and other people, and they send in law enforcement, U.S.
[01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:53.174]  Senators, to use their quote gravitas and their credibility to tell people I'm a Russian agent.
[01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:55.356]  Hell, they do it in Congress for everybody.
[01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.036]  100% lie.
[01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.649]  As God is my witness, I'll be struck down if that was true.
[01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:01.250]  It's a lie.
[01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:02.370]  They're the liars.
[01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:03.111]  They're the enemies.
[01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:04.732]  And folks, they're doing it to everybody.
[01:11:04.932 --> 01:11:05.973]  And this is what they want to do.
[01:11:06.013 --> 01:11:07.454]  They're all criminals.
[01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:11.336]  Knuckle-dragging, lying filth that hates you and your family.
[01:11:12.366 --> 01:11:14.407]  And they're working around the clock to shut us down.
[01:11:14.447 --> 01:11:14.787]  And you know what?
[01:11:14.807 --> 01:11:18.309]  I'm honored that such trash sees me as one of their main enemies.
[01:11:18.589 --> 01:11:19.529]  But I need your prayers.
[01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:23.631]  And I need you to do whatever it takes, politically and legally and lawfully.
[01:11:23.651 --> 01:11:25.292]  And there's a lot of ways to get the word out.
[01:11:25.372 --> 01:11:29.514]  So, print up Infowars.com, forbidden information.
[01:11:29.634 --> 01:11:30.814]  Find out what they don't want you to see.
[01:11:30.934 --> 01:11:33.115]  Or Newswars.com, forbidden information.
[01:11:33.895 --> 01:11:34.876]  Find out what they don't want you to learn.
[01:11:36.443 --> 01:11:38.245]  Everybody, just go to the local store.
[01:11:38.265 --> 01:11:40.707]  It costs like $10 to print up 500 cards.
[01:11:41.327 --> 01:11:42.208]  Please just do it.
[01:11:42.228 --> 01:11:42.829]  We're in a war.
[01:11:42.889 --> 01:11:43.730]  Don't let them win.
[01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:46.292]  We have the antidote to their poison.
[01:11:46.672 --> 01:11:47.693]  You've done it so far.
[01:11:48.093 --> 01:11:49.114]  Put it on the side of your barn.
[01:11:49.355 --> 01:11:50.075]  Put up a billboard.
[01:11:51.757 --> 01:11:53.338]  I see emails all the time that we miss later.
[01:11:54.699 --> 01:11:58.182]  Tens of thousands coming today saying, hey, do I have permission to put InfoWars on the side of my barn?
[01:11:58.483 --> 01:11:59.223]  You don't have permission.
[01:11:59.263 --> 01:12:01.966]  You have me on my knees literally kissing your feet.
[01:12:02.932 --> 01:12:06.615]  Pay for an airplane to fly around with Infowars.com behind it.
[01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:07.735]  Do whatever!
[01:12:07.976 --> 01:12:09.217]  I have expended my energy.
[01:12:09.517 --> 01:12:11.398]  I've expended my fuel.
[01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:19.764]  I've got fuel to keep this operation going for a while because of you, but we've got to reach out and let people have the chain reaction the enemy fears so much.
[01:12:20.805 --> 01:12:22.106]  So thank the local station.
[01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:32.359]  Tell buy an ad in the local paper saying, here are the forbidden information no one wants you to see or hear at the local station and put their call letters and when I'm on.
[01:12:32.659 --> 01:12:34.461]  Or send a hundred bucks to the station and tell them why.
[01:12:34.701 --> 01:12:37.183]  That's why we're on the air still and gaining stations.
[01:12:38.445 --> 01:12:42.088]  And then I get censored everywhere on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:12:42.409 --> 01:12:44.351]  Go to that local station that has their own audio stream.
[01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:54.197]  And then you go put that on Facebook, or you go put that on Twitter, and you say, ooh, the Forbidden Show's on right now on this local station, and people will click it.
[01:12:54.577 --> 01:12:58.418]  Every little bit of energy you put in, in the war, is what takes us over the top.
[01:12:59.018 --> 01:13:00.538]  And I want to beat these bastards, man.
[01:13:00.578 --> 01:13:01.679]  They are so evil.
[01:13:02.839 --> 01:13:06.380]  In fact, I never really had a lot of fear of the globalists, but I had fear of failure.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.441]  But now, I've got to really control myself, because I'm just absolutely on fire and crazed.
[01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:23.390]  I mean I've experienced how bad they are and it just confirms everything I already knew and just makes me know I've just got to get my act together and really get on my knees every day and ask God to lead God and direct me to beat these people.
[01:13:24.991 --> 01:13:29.195]  So I need you to pray for me and hold me up against the enemy and I pray for you and hold you up.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.002]  I need you to pray for me and pray for guidance and discernment and for a hedge of protection around everything we do here.
[01:13:35.282 --> 01:13:36.183]  I don't just believe in it.
[01:13:36.363 --> 01:13:37.784]  I know it's real and it's essential.
[01:13:38.064 --> 01:13:39.124]  So prayers number one.
[01:13:39.424 --> 01:13:40.545]  Spreading the words number two.
[01:13:41.385 --> 01:13:46.387]  And number three, ladies and gentlemen, everybody needs non-GLM seats.
[01:13:46.467 --> 01:13:48.048]  Everybody needs water filtration, air filtration.
[01:13:48.068 --> 01:13:49.129]  We've got the best for the price.
[01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:51.210]  You can pay five times more and get something better.
[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:52.810]  That's how I work in my life.
[01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:55.351]  I go like, what's the lowest price best thing there is?
[01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:56.412]  And then that's what I push.
[01:13:57.349 --> 01:13:58.270]  Because that's just who I am.
[01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:59.712]  That's the way my mindset operates.
[01:13:59.772 --> 01:14:01.755]  I just get in there, and I want to thank you.
[01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:04.678]  You think I like sitting here in this war saying, I need more ammo?
[01:14:04.859 --> 01:14:05.600]  I need more ammo.
[01:14:07.362 --> 01:14:09.645]  The globalists are so pissed they haven't shut us down yet.
[01:14:09.665 --> 01:14:10.546]  They don't even know what to do.
[01:14:10.586 --> 01:14:11.627]  They're beside themselves.
[01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:14.271]  They need to destroy my name before they assassinate me.
[01:14:15.336 --> 01:14:15.876]  That's the plan.
[01:14:16.177 --> 01:14:17.378]  They haven't done it yet.
[01:14:17.418 --> 01:14:19.239]  You go, why are you so important?
[01:14:19.259 --> 01:14:23.242]  Because they've picked us as a symbol they want to create of a bad person.
[01:14:23.642 --> 01:14:25.884]  The enemy, the devil, can't create.
[01:14:26.164 --> 01:14:27.325]  The devil can only invert.
[01:14:27.405 --> 01:14:28.626]  The devil doesn't even know it's true.
[01:14:29.807 --> 01:14:32.309]  These evil people, I've learned, just don't even know the light if they saw it.
[01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:35.752]  Like Congressman Gohmert said to Sundar Pichai.
[01:14:36.452 --> 01:14:38.774]  He goes, you've been in the dark so long, you wouldn't even know the light if you saw it.
[01:14:41.696 --> 01:14:42.137]  And that's it.
[01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:44.547]  The globalists just lie.
[01:14:44.627 --> 01:14:46.588]  What they want, they then believe is reality.
[01:14:46.628 --> 01:14:47.688]  They're actually delusional.
[01:14:49.489 --> 01:14:58.074]  And they just can't believe their bull, and their mojo, and their voodoo, and they're announcing, I'm a failure, and I'm done, and I'm a fake, and I'm losing, and you're losing.
[01:14:58.354 --> 01:15:00.575]  That's all them whistling past the graveyard, folks.
[01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:01.996]  That's them whistling in the dark.
[01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:03.997]  We are acing them.
[01:15:05.758 --> 01:15:09.040]  But we've hit a whole other level where I need to stay in the game a lot longer.
[01:15:10.287 --> 01:15:11.328]  I don't say that selfishly.
[01:15:11.788 --> 01:15:14.210]  They have not been successful in taking over my identity.
[01:15:15.871 --> 01:15:17.813]  With their body snatching system, politically.
[01:15:18.253 --> 01:15:24.238]  And then being able to have Alex Jones as this card in the deck of badness and evilness.
[01:15:24.918 --> 01:15:29.422]  Taking themselves and projecting it onto you, onto me, and onto populace and God-fearing people.
[01:15:29.682 --> 01:15:32.024]  They failed and they don't even know what to do now!
[01:15:32.604 --> 01:15:33.505]  They're cross-eyed!
[01:15:34.502 --> 01:15:41.347]  And they just keep trying to pressure us, and trying to convince us we've done something wrong, and trying to manipulate our conscience, and trying to get us to play into their narrative.
[01:15:41.707 --> 01:15:42.988]  It's not gonna happen!
[01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:45.190]  Look in the mirror, Senator!
[01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:47.631]  You're an ugly demon, a devil!
[01:15:47.851 --> 01:15:49.012]  You're going to hell!
[01:15:49.252 --> 01:15:50.593]  You were always of your father!
[01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:52.034]  You'll never beat God!
[01:15:52.094 --> 01:15:53.375]  You'll never beat America!
[01:15:53.776 --> 01:15:54.976]  Because you're trash!
[01:15:55.477 --> 01:15:56.277]  You're scum!
[01:15:56.558 --> 01:15:57.398]  You're a mutant!
[01:15:57.798 --> 01:15:58.459]  You're over!
[01:15:58.919 --> 01:15:59.540]  You're done!
[01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:08.435]  You're north of 281 south of the scales, correct?
[01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:47.538]  Chief Kerish did say today that they have reached over 300,000 apprehensions along the southwestern border for this fiscal year alone.
[01:16:47.898 --> 01:16:50.720]  Now, specifically here in the RGV, they have seen over 130,000.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:17:00.706]  CBP today released that they're expecting to apprehend over 55,000 family units for the month of March alone.
[01:17:01.426 --> 01:17:08.312]  The fact of the matter is this is not an emergency and the president's fear-mongering doesn't make it one.
[01:17:08.652 --> 01:17:11.014]  There is no crisis at the border.
[01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:17.320]  I'll state that this is a manufactured crisis and a crisis that manufactured by the Trump administration.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:27.769]  But he clearly understands in his gut what stirs his base and he is determined to inflame these fears regardless of the facts or the effect this will have on the country.
[01:17:28.169 --> 01:17:31.811]  What's at the core of this crisis is the Trump administration.
[01:17:31.871 --> 01:17:37.554]  The reason the Democrats refuse to call this a crisis is because they see it as an opportunity.
[01:17:37.594 --> 01:17:43.537]  CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our southwest border.
[01:17:43.597 --> 01:17:49.060]  The Mexican Interior Secretary said that they're planning to see come through Mexico the mother of all caravans.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.082]  It is very definitely a crisis and the question is what do you do about it?
[01:17:52.142 --> 01:17:53.183]  We will build a wall.
[01:17:53.743 --> 01:17:54.803]  We will build a wall.
[01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:57.405]  We will build a wall.
[01:18:03.203 --> 01:18:07.586]  Through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:10.669]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.544]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:31.925 --> 01:20:36.068]  It's Alex Jones live from Austin, Texas.
[01:20:36.388 --> 01:20:40.832]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:20:53.294 --> 01:20:57.036]  There is so much incredible news and video clips that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:20:57.196 --> 01:21:01.879]  And so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to start going to those clips now.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.562]  And then I'm going to take your phone calls going into the next segment.
[01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:13.126]  And I also talked about how I was going to lay out the big picture of what's happening geopolitically and then what's happening in North America.
[01:21:13.146 --> 01:21:14.487]  And I'm going to do that.
[01:21:15.683 --> 01:21:22.110]  During this segment as well, and I basically already laid most of it out, but I want listeners to understand something.
[01:21:23.131 --> 01:21:24.392]  This is not hyperbole.
[01:21:24.472 --> 01:21:25.813]  This is not exaggeration.
[01:21:26.894 --> 01:21:38.626]  If anything, how out of control things are is so unspeakably big and dangerous that I'm not even getting chills at this point.
[01:21:41.846 --> 01:21:47.270]  I'm getting the genetic, biological response that I get when I'm fighting for my life.
[01:21:49.852 --> 01:21:59.698]  And it's the face tightening up, and the eyes getting clear, and the brain moving faster, and the IQ going up.
[01:22:01.419 --> 01:22:04.782]  That's the electrical charge in the atmosphere.
[01:22:05.182 --> 01:22:09.125]  My cells are responding like I'm in a fight for my life.
[01:22:10.871 --> 01:22:11.832]  And everyone can feel it.
[01:22:11.912 --> 01:22:13.354]  And so people say, you're having anxiety.
[01:22:13.394 --> 01:22:14.535]  Go to a psychologist.
[01:22:14.855 --> 01:22:16.016]  Get on some Prozac.
[01:22:16.136 --> 01:22:16.417]  No!
[01:22:16.857 --> 01:22:17.838]  Get close to God.
[01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:18.939]  Go for a hike.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.001]  Eat some food that's better for you.
[01:22:21.282 --> 01:22:22.263]  I'm not on some high horse.
[01:22:22.643 --> 01:22:26.827]  I'm just saying, folks, your body's freaked out for a reason.
[01:22:30.752 --> 01:22:34.015]  You're bouncing off the walls because everybody can feel it.
[01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:41.604]  Pull up Christina Amanpour first.
[01:22:43.245 --> 01:22:44.486]  She has Comey on.
[01:22:45.766 --> 01:22:47.207]  Never thought I'd agree with James Comey.
[01:22:49.188 --> 01:22:51.990]  Who perjures himself to Congress, who ran the fake Russia Gay Garbage.
[01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:55.392]  But who himself just wanted a home of power.
[01:22:56.653 --> 01:22:58.534]  He'd been owned by the Bushes and the Clintons before him.
[01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:00.395]  And...
[01:23:02.446 --> 01:23:09.611]  He was just so incompetent and so weird and so double dealing that Trump even tried to bring him in, but he kept double dealing.
[01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:15.956]  And Trump, of course, knew he was leaking stuff to the press while he was lying about it.
[01:23:15.976 --> 01:23:18.297]  I mean, you think you have your own intelligence agencies, Jack?
[01:23:19.058 --> 01:23:20.539]  You don't know who was watching you the whole time?
[01:23:20.559 --> 01:23:24.622]  You people make me sick.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.422]  He goes on Christina Amanpour's show, Mrs. Bilderberg.
[01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:38.045]  She's got a nice wig she's wearing these days.
[01:23:40.446 --> 01:23:45.289]  And she says, shouldn't law enforcement stop people saying, lock Hillary Clinton up?
[01:23:48.431 --> 01:23:50.293]  I mean, we push Hillary for president.
[01:23:51.153 --> 01:23:52.094]  We made that popular.
[01:23:52.154 --> 01:23:52.994]  Somebody else coined it.
[01:23:53.275 --> 01:23:56.677]  I saw it again on somebody's yard at a sign they put up in Austin.
[01:23:56.697 --> 01:23:57.597]  I thought, that's a good idea.
[01:23:58.618 --> 01:23:59.999]  But whoever that guy is, he coined it.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.702]  But we popularized it, this audience did.
[01:24:03.742 --> 01:24:04.242]  You're awesome.
[01:24:05.403 --> 01:24:07.165]  We had airplanes flying around the country saying it.
[01:24:08.246 --> 01:24:10.528]  And she's saying, shouldn't we arrest them?
[01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:23.219]  Now think about the authoritarian instinct that she's on international television, aiding and abetting other countries that are watching her on CNN in the U.S.
[01:24:23.639 --> 01:24:26.562]  and CNN in Canada and CNN in Europe and the Middle East and Asia.
[01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:29.044]  CNN's on all over the world.
[01:24:30.506 --> 01:24:32.247]  People know not to believe it, but still, it's on.
[01:24:32.587 --> 01:24:33.208]  Force-fed.
[01:24:33.828 --> 01:24:34.469]  CIA.
[01:24:34.929 --> 01:24:35.810]  It is CIA.
[01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:37.571]  Been CIA.
[01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:39.953]  Since Ted Turner set it up on military satellites.
[01:24:39.973 --> 01:24:43.195]  When we say CIA, we mean the establishment CIA.
[01:24:44.035 --> 01:24:47.198]  Not defending the CIA, but it's always too broad to say THE, you know, THEM.
[01:24:47.278 --> 01:24:51.080]  The CIA's like the biggest, oldest, modern intelligence agency.
[01:24:51.481 --> 01:24:55.704]  Army intelligence and naval intelligence precursors that, of course, and has never trusted the CIA.
[01:24:56.064 --> 01:24:57.385]  So it's governments within governments.
[01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:11.871]  But you've got him up there being asked about arresting people, talking about me, talking about you, that say lock her up because the rhetoric was effective, it was true.
[01:25:12.331 --> 01:25:16.314]  And now they know they're close to getting locked up for all the crimes they've committed, the crimes he's committed.
[01:25:16.455 --> 01:25:23.060]  So what she's really saying is, isn't it time to move with law enforcement against people trying to stop you and your criminal activity?
[01:25:26.124 --> 01:25:28.485]  He's like, oh no, no, we have that right in America.
[01:25:29.205 --> 01:25:31.005]  Because he understands the climate now.
[01:25:31.365 --> 01:25:36.667]  And he's trying to keep his head down with Clapper and Brennan and the other conspirators who know Trump's got the goods on him.
[01:25:36.887 --> 01:25:43.609]  And all I'm saying is, Mr. President, I don't mind having my ass hanging out here in the wind with the American people because we count on you.
[01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:45.229]  But the damn borders just collapsed.
[01:25:45.249 --> 01:25:47.390]  The Border Patrol ran up an SOS red alert.
[01:25:49.226 --> 01:25:53.168]  There's firefights going on on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border and the Colombian border.
[01:25:53.188 --> 01:25:56.530]  They can hardly keep another 5 million people from storming our ass.
[01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:03.794]  The Democrats are running around and engaging in open treason, and if you sit there and you let them do it, then you're aiding and abetting them.
[01:26:03.894 --> 01:26:06.856]  And listen, I don't know exactly what the move is to stop it.
[01:26:08.482 --> 01:26:16.308]  I just know, legally and lawfully, through the executive and through the Congress, we have to act on this thing now because this is orchestrated by outside powers.
[01:26:16.728 --> 01:26:18.689]  It's destroying the country in front of everybody's face.
[01:26:19.450 --> 01:26:24.553]  And the stuff they're doing to me just shows.
[01:26:24.673 --> 01:26:26.054]  It doesn't go, oh, I'm being attacked.
[01:26:26.074 --> 01:26:26.815]  They're lying about me.
[01:26:26.835 --> 01:26:28.916]  They're doing dirty tricks and espionage.
[01:26:29.297 --> 01:26:31.738]  They're doing stuff that's just over-the-top criminal.
[01:26:33.019 --> 01:26:34.761]  It's that they don't even care if they get caught.
[01:26:34.861 --> 01:26:38.023]  They've reached a wild, cornered animal level.
[01:26:40.424 --> 01:26:43.906]  And it's like you wake up and you're vacationing in Colorado.
[01:26:43.926 --> 01:26:44.687]  This has happened to people.
[01:26:45.307 --> 01:26:47.029]  And you walk in at, you know, 5 a.m.
[01:26:47.049 --> 01:26:47.829]  to make some coffee.
[01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:55.174]  And there's a mountain lion sitting there on the counter eating the ham you left out the night before.
[01:26:57.616 --> 01:26:59.357]  Now, if you give it a chance to leave, it'll go.
[01:26:59.397 --> 01:27:00.358]  But what if it's rabid?
[01:27:02.199 --> 01:27:05.801]  And what if it's got you and your kids cornered and it's coming towards you with foam coming out of its mouth?
[01:27:06.362 --> 01:27:09.444]  I don't want to have this fight, but I'm cornered by a rabid animal.
[01:27:10.948 --> 01:27:23.057]  I'm cornered, they're cornered, and I'd back off these people, except they're a bunch of perverts and weirdos obsessed with sexualizing our kids, and they want to bankrupt everything, and they're jealous of free market.
[01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:25.059]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.500]  We've got to oppose these people.
[01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:30.223]  There's no more games, there's no more playing games.
[01:27:30.643 --> 01:27:35.326]  Trump's tried to keep the stock market up while he has confidence, while he stops the UN collapse of the border.
[01:27:35.967 --> 01:27:37.308]  We don't have any more time.
[01:27:38.865 --> 01:27:42.030]  We'll give the number out in a moment, but here is Comey with Christina Amanpour.
[01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:46.697]  This is basically the mouth of the EU on CNN saying, arrest the American people.
[01:27:49.489 --> 01:27:53.772]  I've got one question because you just said lock her up, or lock me up.
[01:27:54.172 --> 01:27:58.114]  Of course, lock her up was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign.
[01:27:58.634 --> 01:28:14.243]  Do you, in retrospect, wish that people like yourself, the head of the FBI, I mean the people in charge of law and order, had shut down that language, that it was dangerous potentially, that it could have created violence, that it's kind of hate speech.
[01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:16.084]  Should that have been allowed?
[01:28:17.335 --> 01:28:18.956]  That's not a role for government to play.
[01:28:19.216 --> 01:28:24.701]  The beauty of this country is people can say what they want, even if it's misleading and it's demagoguery.
[01:28:25.141 --> 01:28:32.787]  The people who should have shut it down were Republicans who understand the rule of law and the values that they claim to stand for.
[01:28:32.867 --> 01:28:33.607]  Shame on them.
[01:28:34.048 --> 01:28:35.529]  But it wasn't a role for government to play.
[01:28:35.649 --> 01:28:35.889]  Alright.
[01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:38.911]  When we come back, we're going to analyze that short clip.
[01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:41.073]  Then I'm going to give the number out that I'm going to cover the big clips.
[01:28:41.133 --> 01:28:43.295]  But did you catch all that?
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.000]  Because that's the future right there.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.781]  That's the plan.
[01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:50.402]  That's how we're able to tell you tomorrow's news today.
[01:28:50.762 --> 01:28:55.483]  Whatever you do, by hand, by carrier pigeon, by however, spread the link.
[01:28:55.683 --> 01:28:57.444]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:57.844 --> 01:28:58.964]  NewsWars.com.
[01:28:59.624 --> 01:29:00.525]  Please accept this mission.
[01:29:07.887 --> 01:29:08.587]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:29:09.693 --> 01:29:13.456]  We are running a special right now that we've never run before.
[01:29:13.756 --> 01:29:18.459]  And even though, DNA Force overall is our most profitable product.
[01:29:18.579 --> 01:29:23.643]  And that's because people that know in the market what it is understand it's an incredibly good deal.
[01:29:23.723 --> 01:29:33.029]  The problem is only athletes and folks that are really into health understand BioPQQ, CoQ10 and other things like this that come from organically produced sources.
[01:29:33.249 --> 01:29:36.412]  The average person isn't into vitamins or minerals or supplements.
[01:29:36.612 --> 01:29:36.812]  And then
[01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:40.194]  Only folks that are really into it know about how special it is.
[01:29:40.434 --> 01:29:49.878]  And so when they see us selling DNA Force Plus and the dosages of real PQQ and CoQ10, they go, it's $150 normally?
[01:29:50.018 --> 01:29:55.401]  When the lowest price leading competitors like $300 and people get it through medical clinics.
[01:29:55.541 --> 01:30:02.264]  Because it is a great nootropic, it's a great thing for the whole body, for all the cells, for the bones, for the DNA, for the telomeres, for the nerves.
[01:30:03.044 --> 01:30:07.807]  But people aren't ready to pay that, so they have synthetic PQQ and CoQ10 at the stores.
[01:30:07.888 --> 01:30:12.211]  It's still $50-$60 for a little big bottle, and the word is, the synthetic doesn't even get absorbed.
[01:30:12.351 --> 01:30:18.875]  So, I set out to give you the best, and back when it was costing us $50-$60 a bottle, we were selling it for $110-$120 a bottle.
[01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:21.017]  We gotta get our money back and fund things.
[01:30:21.057 --> 01:30:28.642]  But I made a big enough deal to sign a contract out a few years to get a super discount on this, but now I gotta move a lot of it.
[01:30:28.742 --> 01:30:29.683]  So, it's normally $100 now.
[01:30:31.465 --> 01:30:32.346]  $110 or so.
[01:30:32.546 --> 01:30:36.752]  It's right now at Infowarsstore.com selling for only $60.
[01:30:37.053 --> 01:30:40.417]  It's selling for $59.80 right now.
[01:30:40.878 --> 01:30:47.187]  97% reviews for DNA Plus, the new formula of DNA Force, because we made it even stronger, by the way, when I made the better deal.
[01:30:47.267 --> 01:30:49.470]  So it's a great deal at $110 or so.
[01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:52.794]  It is unbelievably insane at $59.
[01:30:53.235 --> 01:30:55.718]  And the money we do make obviously funds this operation.
[01:30:55.738 --> 01:30:58.041]  So, it's like X2 though, the good halogen.
[01:30:58.161 --> 01:31:00.404]  It takes a few weeks for you to notice the results.
[01:31:00.825 --> 01:31:02.707]  But if you'll just get a bottle and take it.
[01:31:03.248 --> 01:31:04.609]  You think carrots are good for your eyes?
[01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:06.670]  You think antioxidants are good for your skin?
[01:31:06.871 --> 01:31:10.173]  I mean, it's a joke what happens with this, and it's proven.
[01:31:10.213 --> 01:31:13.415]  You can say it slows the deterioration of the telomeres.
[01:31:13.475 --> 01:31:14.836]  That means they don't die as fast.
[01:31:14.976 --> 01:31:16.097]  You can say that makes them last longer.
[01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:16.978]  Half empty, half full.
[01:31:17.078 --> 01:31:17.898]  It does so much more.
[01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:27.985]  ELEV ATP, Ancient Pea Apple Extract, PQQ, CoQ10, Organic Reishi, Astragalus Root Extract, and even more incredible ingredients.
[01:31:28.185 --> 01:31:30.827]  It is 60% off and free shipping.
[01:31:30.947 --> 01:31:32.048]  And if you sign up for AutoShip,
[01:31:32.168 --> 01:31:37.953]  You cancel any time, every month, every two months, whatever you want, you just pick the time there, you get an additional 10% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:38.153 --> 01:31:42.716]  And there's so many other big deals going at infowarestore.com, but DNA Force really is special.
[01:31:42.877 --> 01:31:49.001]  This run at this current rate will sell out in about a week and a half, so this special's not going to run too long, but I have another order coming in soon.
[01:31:49.021 --> 01:31:53.525]  It won't be sold out for six months this time, because again, I've signed the contract to have it come in as we need it.
[01:31:53.605 --> 01:31:55.306]  DNA Force Plus, you want to experience it.
[01:32:02.753 --> 01:32:08.477]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:32:08.778 --> 01:32:12.800]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:15.442]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:32:15.482 --> 01:32:17.604]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:32:17.964 --> 01:32:19.965]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:32:20.486 --> 01:32:20.726]  Boom!
[01:32:21.006 --> 01:32:23.268]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:32:23.608 --> 01:32:25.169]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:26.590]  You still have InfoWars.
[01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:27.130]  We're good to go.
[01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:50.136]  You're listening to the Alex
[01:33:24.304 --> 01:33:28.435]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:29.156 --> 01:33:30.500]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:34.815 --> 01:33:36.657]  Are you worried about the impact on the U.S.
[01:33:36.697 --> 01:33:38.318]  economy by closing the borders?
[01:33:38.338 --> 01:33:40.640]  Sure, it's going to have a negative impact on the economy.
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:46.545]  It's one of the biggest trade deals in the world that we've just done with the USMCA.
[01:33:47.686 --> 01:33:56.914]  It's a very big trading partner, but to me, trading is very important, the borders are very important, but security is what is most important.
[01:33:56.934 --> 01:33:58.015]  You have to have security.
[01:33:58.155 --> 01:33:59.936]  This is what this gentleman is all about.
[01:34:00.737 --> 01:34:01.238]  To my right,
[01:34:02.711 --> 01:34:05.492]  And we're going to have security in this country.
[01:34:05.952 --> 01:34:07.832]  That's more important than trade.
[01:34:07.852 --> 01:34:10.133]  Hey, all you hear me talking about is trade.
[01:34:11.373 --> 01:34:12.913]  But let me just give you a little secret.
[01:34:13.074 --> 01:34:15.994]  Security is more important to me than trade.
[01:34:16.574 --> 01:34:20.075]  So we're going to have a strong border, but we're going to have a closed border.
[01:34:21.095 --> 01:34:31.198]  And you know, when we close that border, we will stop hundreds of millions of dollars of drugs from coming in, because tremendous amounts of drugs come through our southern border.
[01:34:40.993 --> 01:34:42.594]  What's happening is the U.N.
[01:34:42.634 --> 01:34:44.295]  model of collapsing Europe, collapsing the U.S.
[01:34:44.355 --> 01:34:45.956]  is in third world populations this year.
[01:34:46.356 --> 01:34:47.997]  The Border Patrol is officially overwhelmed.
[01:34:48.778 --> 01:34:51.099]  It is three times any collapse level before.
[01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:56.002]  The President has to be calm because he doesn't want to plunge the economy.
[01:34:56.142 --> 01:35:00.505]  But he just signaled to everybody, if we don't control the border, we don't have a nation anyways.
[01:35:00.986 --> 01:35:03.087]  And so yes, we've got to seal the border, but that's going to take
[01:35:05.307 --> 01:35:05.627]  100,000 troops.
[01:35:05.947 --> 01:35:07.288]  You cannot let them get in.
[01:35:07.348 --> 01:35:10.009]  And people are willing to drag babies through barbed wire to get in.
[01:35:10.129 --> 01:35:11.649]  The law has to be changed now.
[01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:20.992]  But the Democrats have so beat people over the head that, oh, it's mean if you ship somebody back, or it's mean they've got to have all these immigration hearings.
[01:35:21.272 --> 01:35:22.573]  They're backed up six years.
[01:35:22.593 --> 01:35:26.694]  97% of people, look it up, don't ever show up for the immigration hearing.
[01:35:28.094 --> 01:35:29.575]  So, a mother of three.
[01:35:31.098 --> 01:35:31.658]  Single mother.
[01:35:31.738 --> 01:35:32.659]  She's working two jobs.
[01:35:33.479 --> 01:35:34.160]  She does the laundry.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:34.940]  She cooks the meals.
[01:35:36.161 --> 01:35:36.981]  She pays her bills.
[01:35:37.001 --> 01:35:40.023]  Illegal alien hits her with no insurance.
[01:35:40.043 --> 01:35:40.663]  What happens to her?
[01:35:42.404 --> 01:35:42.825]  It's just true.
[01:35:42.865 --> 01:35:44.545]  The illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:35:47.227 --> 01:35:50.769]  And they're being used as a permanent underclass to undercut the whole system.
[01:35:50.869 --> 01:35:51.649]  It's a plan.
[01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.570]  Walmart.
[01:35:54.191 --> 01:35:54.951]  Very predatory.
[01:35:56.412 --> 01:35:57.192]  Would tell workers.
[01:35:57.813 --> 01:35:59.814]  This came out 10 years ago in their own manuals.
[01:36:01.578 --> 01:36:08.143]  We only keep you part-time so that you then are able to get food stamps and aid.
[01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:11.506]  So here's how you go get food stamps and aid, and here's how you can make more money.
[01:36:13.207 --> 01:36:18.071]  So Walmart uses government subsidy, taxpayer money, to undercut the whole market.
[01:36:18.091 --> 01:36:22.254]  But notice, Walmart itself is now being displaced by Amazon.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:34.565]  So, this is a consolidation going on, and when you bring in a giant third world, low IQ population... By the way, the third world has smart people in it.
[01:36:34.725 --> 01:36:35.426]  They're staying there.
[01:36:35.706 --> 01:36:36.226]  They own things.
[01:36:36.246 --> 01:36:36.706]  They run things.
[01:36:37.007 --> 01:36:46.371]  We're taking the bottom, the most desperate, the most criminal, the most diseased, the most mentally ill, the most unskilled into our country.
[01:36:46.511 --> 01:36:47.111]  What does that do?
[01:36:48.752 --> 01:36:50.133]  They go, oh, the Statue of Liberty!
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.821]  Statue of Liberty was sent here by the French.
[01:36:56.161 --> 01:36:57.142]  They tried to give it to the Egyptians.
[01:36:57.162 --> 01:36:57.702]  They didn't want it.
[01:36:58.262 --> 01:36:58.842]  It's a cultic.
[01:36:58.942 --> 01:36:59.782]  It's a guy in drag.
[01:36:59.882 --> 01:37:00.243]  Look it up.
[01:37:01.523 --> 01:37:03.184]  It's a mafraditic god.
[01:37:04.664 --> 01:37:06.124]  And they're in Ellis Island where it sits.
[01:37:06.845 --> 01:37:09.065]  They kept you three to six months to make sure you didn't have disease.
[01:37:09.646 --> 01:37:11.346]  They don't check anything now.
[01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:13.467]  They don't check you're not a human smuggler.
[01:37:13.687 --> 01:37:16.028]  And I know you know that, but that's the lawlessness.
[01:37:16.688 --> 01:37:19.769]  Next time you're going through an internal border patrol checkpoint,
[01:37:23.177 --> 01:37:25.038]  I've said to them, why do you want to ask if I'm a citizen?
[01:37:25.058 --> 01:37:25.899]  It wouldn't matter if I wasn't.
[01:37:25.919 --> 01:37:26.659]  They go, yeah, you're right.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.181]  Why do you have checkpoints at the TSA?
[01:37:30.941 --> 01:37:32.402]  To make sure a jihadi doesn't blow us up?
[01:37:32.422 --> 01:37:33.603]  You just let them in and protect them.
[01:37:34.543 --> 01:37:35.544]  It's all a joke.
[01:37:35.564 --> 01:37:39.206]  Next time you're trying to get in a football game, they want to wand you.
[01:37:39.626 --> 01:37:40.506]  Well, why would you do that?
[01:37:40.566 --> 01:37:42.548]  I have a right to be in this football game for free!
[01:37:42.568 --> 01:37:45.809]  Like, no, no, that's a private company, a private thing.
[01:37:46.169 --> 01:37:47.190]  Well, so's our country!
[01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:48.591]  We paid for this!
[01:37:51.124 --> 01:37:52.065]  We're being exploited.
[01:37:52.945 --> 01:37:54.206]  Our openness is being exploited.
[01:37:55.927 --> 01:37:58.950]  And this country is being collapsed.
[01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:02.732]  And I know everybody gets it, so now I promise when we come back, I'm going bam, bam, bam to your calls.
[01:38:03.613 --> 01:38:07.456]  First up, first round, military, police, Border Patrol, former Border Patrol.
[01:38:07.856 --> 01:38:09.777]  I want to get your take on this if I'm wrong or if I'm right.
[01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:13.800]  But the head of the Border Patrol, they all say, it's collapsed, red alert, help us, help us, help us.
[01:38:14.781 --> 01:38:16.162]  And Trump's like, I'm gonna have to shut the border.
[01:38:16.222 --> 01:38:17.863]  Well, he doesn't have the resources to do it.
[01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:20.951]  We have to stop the Democrats.
[01:38:20.971 --> 01:38:22.232]  We have to stop USAID.
[01:38:23.093 --> 01:38:23.733]  That's the name of it.
[01:38:23.873 --> 01:38:24.754]  U-S-A-I-D.
[01:38:25.014 --> 01:38:25.795]  Out of the State Department.
[01:38:25.815 --> 01:38:36.023]  You don't think Soros gives his own money to have these giant migrant centers in southern Mexico and all these other Central American countries down to South America.
[01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:46.091]  They have cover stories on Reuters about how great he is and how they give $3,000 to each person on their card that doesn't even have their name on it.
[01:38:47.179 --> 01:38:52.902]  And then they go, hey, George Soros is behind it, and they go, oh, conspiracy theorists, fire Lou Dobbs, get rid of Judicial Watch, they're lying!
[01:38:53.103 --> 01:38:56.404]  They're not lying, they're calling the elephant in the room.
[01:38:59.606 --> 01:39:04.369]  And the average American still knows they're being lied to, but not as bad as they imagine.
[01:39:04.449 --> 01:39:05.070]  It's even worse.
[01:39:07.071 --> 01:39:10.533]  I've had people, high level, make up outrageous lies about me.
[01:39:11.923 --> 01:39:17.047]  And they tell people these lies, and the folks I talk to cannot believe that the U.S.
[01:39:17.087 --> 01:39:21.230]  Senator or people like that would tell someone like this.
[01:39:21.250 --> 01:39:36.421]  They would call and get involved in things I'm involved in and say, you better not represent Alex Jones, or you better get rid of his bank account, or you better, because he's under criminal investigation and we know he's a Russian and a Ukrainian, and he's going to be going to jail soon.
[01:39:40.278 --> 01:39:42.039]  100% on my children.
[01:39:42.079 --> 01:39:46.120]  I've never taken a red cent from a Russian government on any foreign government.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.741]  And look, the FBI and all the system knows that.
[01:39:49.121 --> 01:39:50.341]  They don't know what to do.
[01:39:50.681 --> 01:39:59.024]  They have probed everything we do, and they're all a bunch of followers at the top who got their jobs on other powerful people.
[01:39:59.044 --> 01:39:59.984]  They're a bunch of brown nosers.
[01:40:00.285 --> 01:40:07.607]  And they can't believe that Infowars is self-made, that our listeners are real, and that we're not funded by some other group.
[01:40:09.184 --> 01:40:11.827]  I am so proud I'm not a part of an intelligence agency.
[01:40:12.167 --> 01:40:16.251]  I'm so proud that I did what I did by God's help and your support.
[01:40:18.253 --> 01:40:21.676]  And the Democrats now are just in overdrive gear.
[01:40:21.696 --> 01:40:26.400]  You know, they call ICE criminals and murderers and Nazis.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:34.228]  And then there's a guy with both his legs blown off that has a fireman's cross on his elbow, you know, for the name of their unit.
[01:40:36.081 --> 01:40:40.284]  In Afghanistan, anybody knows a fireman's cross, and they call him a Nazi.
[01:40:40.985 --> 01:40:43.647]  And then they end up hiring the woman that did it to run a newspaper.
[01:40:43.667 --> 01:40:45.328]  She gets rewarded for being a liar!
[01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:47.670]  That's just what they do!
[01:40:52.774 --> 01:40:59.539]  And now that New York fact-checker, under fire for mistaking ice worker's tattoo for a Nazi symbol, it's a fireman symbol!
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.762]  Now she got promoted to run a major publication.
[01:41:06.052 --> 01:41:09.215]  Hell, the lady on the board at the New York Times said, whites aren't human.
[01:41:09.775 --> 01:41:11.156]  They went, you go right to the top, lady.
[01:41:11.917 --> 01:41:12.678]  That's who they are.
[01:41:12.698 --> 01:41:13.638]  So here's the toll-free number.
[01:41:14.839 --> 01:41:19.543]  For law enforcement, military, former Border Patrol, current, people living right on the border, we want to hear from you.
[01:41:19.563 --> 01:41:19.824]  877-789-2539.
[01:41:20.764 --> 01:41:25.088]  The first round, wait for those guys to call in, then I'll give open phones to everybody.
[01:41:25.108 --> 01:41:25.248]  877-789-Alex.
[01:41:25.268 --> 01:41:25.308]  877-789-2539.
[01:41:25.328 --> 01:41:27.390]  You don't have to even say your real name or whatever.
[01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:29.071]  You can just say where you're calling from.
[01:41:35.143 --> 01:41:35.903]  And we'll get you on air.
[01:41:35.963 --> 01:41:38.705]  But, hell, they've got the head of the Border Patrol and the deputy head.
[01:41:39.265 --> 01:41:43.927]  The deputy head called us like six years ago down there to catch the illegal aliens that were ordering loaded on buses.
[01:41:44.508 --> 01:41:46.669]  And the public's like, well, why is the Border Patrol helping them?
[01:41:46.689 --> 01:41:47.769]  Because they've been ordered to.
[01:41:48.309 --> 01:41:50.490]  And there's so many of them, they don't have a place to put them!
[01:41:51.131 --> 01:41:53.452]  But they're the ones that called us to say, do something!
[01:41:53.472 --> 01:41:55.533]  I love how the public is, too.
[01:41:57.503 --> 01:42:10.489]  The Border Patrol actually signed up for this, are in dangerous positions, go through all this, they're down there with the scorpions and the rattlesnakes and then the dead people and the dead bodies and people with the diseases and all that hell, and then everybody's mad that they're busing them in.
[01:42:10.729 --> 01:42:14.310]  And I get they should stand down, but if they stand down, then it totally collapses!
[01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:16.811]  Because the law hasn't been changed!
[01:42:17.652 --> 01:42:19.532]  And Trump is not a dictator, but here's the thing.
[01:42:20.533 --> 01:42:25.135]  When you're brought into a national crisis like this by traitors, it's not called martial law, it's called survival.
[01:42:26.365 --> 01:42:32.648]  So all I'm saying at this point is, we gotta really start making some serious decisions here, as a country, about if we're going to be run by these people.
[01:42:32.668 --> 01:42:41.072]  Because the Democrats are a lawless group of lying crooks allied with the Chi-Coms, and they've been caught red-handed and they're scared, and now they're going for broke and they're dangerous.
[01:42:41.673 --> 01:42:44.034]  So make no mistake, this is the most critical time in our history.
[01:42:45.282 --> 01:42:45.482]  877-789-2539.
[01:42:45.502 --> 01:42:47.023]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:47.063 --> 01:42:48.724]  Don't forget, store-wide free shipping.
[01:42:48.984 --> 01:42:52.205]  It's about to end in a couple days, and 56% off on all the supplements.
[01:42:52.305 --> 01:42:52.966]  Huge deals.
[01:42:53.286 --> 01:42:54.646]  Your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:42:54.666 --> 01:42:55.667]  Without you, we are nothing.
[01:42:56.147 --> 01:42:57.708]  Your calls in just a few minutes.
[01:42:57.788 --> 01:42:58.548]  Stay with us.
[01:43:03.090 --> 01:43:03.750]  It's incredible.
[01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:07.032]  We're fighting back, and we're winning thanks to you.
[01:43:07.052 --> 01:43:11.114]  I got some good news for you folks, but some bad news for the globalists.
[01:43:13.695 --> 01:43:16.820]  I've got good news for the people of America and the people of the world.
[01:43:17.621 --> 01:43:22.869]  Trump has been totally exonerated from the entire Russian gate attempted coup d'etat takedown.
[01:43:23.630 --> 01:43:27.616]  And now he's going on the offense with the big executive order of a week ago.
[01:43:29.037 --> 01:43:32.378]  And the word is, Apple and Facebook and Twitter, they're all being
[01:43:53.655 --> 01:43:59.357]  Talked to by the President over the telephone, and private meetings are being set up where he's going to lay down the law.
[01:43:59.837 --> 01:44:10.220]  That they're not going to side with authoritarian foreign powers, and that they're going to either abide by the Constitution and Bill of Rights and not be authoritarians, or he's going to take action against them.
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.521]  That is everything we've needed to hear.
[01:44:12.961 --> 01:44:14.701]  Now let's make sure the President follows through.
[01:44:15.221 --> 01:44:16.622]  Now, InfoWars, as you know,
[01:44:17.362 --> 01:44:19.244]  Well ladies and gentlemen, this is the last few days of the sale.
[01:44:19.264 --> 01:44:21.966]  Some of our best selling items have sold out, others are close to selling out.
[01:44:37.841 --> 01:44:41.223]  We've got to end the sale coming up early next week.
[01:44:41.563 --> 01:44:47.346]  It only leaves four or five days left in this Super Sale at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:47.626 --> 01:44:55.570]  Get store-wide free shipping and 50 to 60% off all these best-selling items and fund the Info War all at the same time.
[01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:56.591]  A total 360 win.
[01:44:56.891 --> 01:45:01.193]  The Save the First Amendment Super Sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:01.513 --> 01:45:02.294]  Only a few days left.
[01:45:04.565 --> 01:45:09.009]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:13.932]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:45:14.533 --> 01:45:20.377]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:45:20.798 --> 01:45:33.388]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:45:34.148 --> 01:45:42.854]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:45:42.875 --> 01:45:44.756]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:45:45.076 --> 01:45:46.177]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:45:46.217 --> 01:45:47.498]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:45:47.678 --> 01:45:48.879]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:45:49.079 --> 01:45:50.559]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.680]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.481]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:45:54.841 --> 01:45:57.442]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:45:57.482 --> 01:45:58.342]  This is insane.
[01:45:58.762 --> 01:46:00.363]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:03.163]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:46:03.624 --> 01:46:05.144]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:46:05.184 --> 01:46:07.005]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:46:07.025 --> 01:46:08.885]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:46:09.746 --> 01:46:15.687]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:46:15.927 --> 01:46:17.268]  All just moderate dose.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:26.788]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:46:26.808 --> 01:46:29.211]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:29.251 --> 01:46:30.392]  But thank you for committing.
[01:46:34.441 --> 01:46:37.283]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:46:37.643 --> 01:46:40.264]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:46:40.284 --> 01:46:45.027]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:46:45.507 --> 01:46:51.631]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:46:51.671 --> 01:46:54.773]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:46:55.113 --> 01:46:56.434]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:47:06.262 --> 01:47:08.893]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.307 --> 01:47:30.808]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:47:30.848 --> 01:47:31.388]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:32.028 --> 01:47:32.729]  I'm here Central.
[01:47:32.989 --> 01:47:33.849]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:35.070]  War Room 3 p.m.
[01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:36.070]  Central with Owen Troyer.
[01:47:36.670 --> 01:47:37.031]  8 a.m.
[01:47:37.071 --> 01:47:37.411]  before me.
[01:47:37.431 --> 01:47:38.211]  Day of the Night.
[01:47:38.231 --> 01:47:39.152]  The Day of the Night Show.
[01:47:39.692 --> 01:47:40.152]  A Central.
[01:47:40.672 --> 01:47:41.353]  Viewing and listening.
[01:47:42.433 --> 01:47:45.635]  All right, I'm gonna go to Thomas, Jim, John, and many others here.
[01:47:46.635 --> 01:47:48.676]  Former and current active-duty Border Patrol.
[01:47:49.336 --> 01:47:50.357]  Witnesses on the border.
[01:47:50.437 --> 01:47:51.697]  That's who we're opening the phones up for.
[01:47:51.717 --> 01:47:51.757]  877-789-2539.
[01:47:51.777 --> 01:47:52.838]  Let me just say this.
[01:47:58.010 --> 01:48:10.414]  I've had old friends, old journalists, people that I've known, people that I basically started their careers, make cheap shots at me because if you make cheap shots on YouTube, they let you operate.
[01:48:10.714 --> 01:48:13.295]  The only way you're allowed to talk about Alex Jones is if it's negative.
[01:48:16.476 --> 01:48:19.797]  And they say, oh my God, Alex Jones supports martial law.
[01:48:19.957 --> 01:48:21.778]  Alex Jones supports Rex 84.
[01:48:23.798 --> 01:48:25.079]  Well, there's an old saying.
[01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:33.126]  And it's called You Live, You Learn, and I learned how the leftists were lying about Ronald Reagan.
[01:48:34.887 --> 01:48:46.376]  And it didn't mean that Ronald Reagan was perfect, but since I learned about the Weathermen and read some of the declassified files that only came out a few years ago, and talked to the folks that infiltrated their groups, like Larry Grafwald, who was a great patriot,
[01:48:48.411 --> 01:49:03.895]  I confirmed that there was a Democrat plan to collapse Mexico and Central America into Southern North America, Mexico, and to bring in martial law through a migrant crisis, and that the Democrats would then activate migrant leaders trained in these U.N.
[01:49:03.935 --> 01:49:06.155]  camps to burn down the U.S.
[01:49:06.936 --> 01:49:07.476]  Now, that was in the 1980s.
[01:49:09.935 --> 01:49:25.966]  And the left always attacked it, and I would see it on PBS and things, and go, wow, that is terrible that they planned martial law, and Oliver North got told to shut up, or the senator said don't talk about it in the congressional hearing, and all the rest of it.
[01:49:27.768 --> 01:49:29.489]  And I was always, Rex 84 bad.
[01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:39.296]  And then you pull back, and they're running the exact op, and you've got Beto O'Rourke, and you've got
[01:49:40.802 --> 01:49:42.583]  Jorge Ramos saying it's over.
[01:49:42.623 --> 01:49:43.364]  The country's gone.
[01:49:43.424 --> 01:49:44.184]  There are no borders.
[01:49:44.565 --> 01:49:45.505]  We're Latin America.
[01:49:45.605 --> 01:49:48.567]  And the UN's running the refugee camps for the invasion.
[01:49:48.607 --> 01:49:50.529]  It was about six months ago I went, wait a minute.
[01:49:50.549 --> 01:49:57.053]  Remember, I'm Mr. FEMA camp, which Obama wanted a national emergency in camps for conservatives.
[01:49:57.253 --> 01:49:58.114]  Hillary talked about it.
[01:49:58.134 --> 01:49:58.574]  Remember?
[01:50:00.776 --> 01:50:01.677]  So there's bad camps.
[01:50:01.737 --> 01:50:02.617]  We want due process.
[01:50:03.538 --> 01:50:06.220]  But if people hit you with 20 million people, there's nowhere to keep them.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:09.122]  You've got to keep them in a facility and ship them back, or you're done.
[01:50:11.377 --> 01:50:14.918]  So they've already overwhelmed the facilities and the judges in due process.
[01:50:14.938 --> 01:50:17.138]  So they put you into martial law artificially.
[01:50:18.598 --> 01:50:25.520]  And then Reagan's plan was, we'll have to use military bases to hold up to 10 million people, because that was the Democrat plan.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.921]  Originally created at Cornell by Bill Ayers, who was Obama's mentor.
[01:50:31.961 --> 01:50:33.201]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:50:33.842 --> 01:50:36.942]  They did this to Europe too, just now, the last 10 years.
[01:50:38.422 --> 01:50:40.863]  So these dogs don't learn new tricks, because these tricks work.
[01:50:41.877 --> 01:50:45.541]  So Reagan and the Pentagon got ready, and you better believe they got plans now.
[01:50:46.442 --> 01:50:48.464]  But they're filled with SJWs at the command level.
[01:50:51.026 --> 01:50:58.353]  And so I came on air with courage and said Rex 84 was a good plan, and I was conned by the left.
[01:50:59.154 --> 01:51:00.956]  And man, did people have a heyday with that.
[01:51:01.356 --> 01:51:04.760]  Mr. Anti-FEMA camp now supports the FEMA camps.
[01:51:07.614 --> 01:51:10.275]  I'm not for a FEMA camp or against a FEMA camp.
[01:51:10.335 --> 01:51:19.840]  If an asteroid hits the Atlantic Ocean with the power of a thousand hydrogen bombs and we've got five years of nuclear winter and everybody's starving to death, people are going to be in emergency facilities.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.041]  Most people are going to die.
[01:51:21.781 --> 01:51:24.302]  A camp is a camp like a gun is a gun or a truck is a truck.
[01:51:24.683 --> 01:51:27.584]  The point is, who's creating the crisis and why are they doing it?
[01:51:27.804 --> 01:51:30.465]  If a bioweapon gets released, you're going to see this stuff happen.
[01:51:30.645 --> 01:51:31.486]  That's why it's in place.
[01:51:32.146 --> 01:51:35.288]  I didn't like it because I had emergency managers and people
[01:51:37.009 --> 01:51:42.414]  Inside the military tell me that Obama, and before that Clinton, was planning martial law and I got the documents.
[01:51:43.795 --> 01:51:48.760]  And I used to be screaming and yelling at the FBI how they were all traitors until we'd be at an illegal army checkpoint.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.523]  The army didn't like what they were doing, training to take guns from citizens on I-35.
[01:51:54.065 --> 01:51:55.707]  I'm like, you scumbag FBI!
[01:51:55.727 --> 01:51:56.308]  You filth!
[01:51:56.588 --> 01:51:58.731]  You filthy military traitors to America!
[01:51:58.771 --> 01:52:00.533]  All of a sudden they're like, turn your camera off for a minute.
[01:52:00.713 --> 01:52:01.494]  Here, here's the documents.
[01:52:01.774 --> 01:52:02.295]  We're on your side.
[01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:02.995]  We don't like this either.
[01:52:03.656 --> 01:52:07.180]  They're like, um, oh, alright.
[01:52:08.662 --> 01:52:11.445]  The military and the police are more awake than anybody, folks.
[01:52:11.465 --> 01:52:12.627]  They don't like this crap!
[01:52:14.778 --> 01:52:20.682]  And then the Black Lives Matter and Kill the Cops movement starts up, and they wanted to kill the cops to make them capitulate to the globalists.
[01:52:21.443 --> 01:52:24.365]  So they would go along with the left taking control of law enforcement.
[01:52:24.925 --> 01:52:27.387]  So they could then put conservatives in the FEMA camps.
[01:52:27.847 --> 01:52:29.008]  The damn camps are there!
[01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:39.055]  So I'm just saying, you gonna let people shove their kids through Constantinowire barbed wire, and then get here by the millions and collapse the whole country?
[01:52:39.295 --> 01:52:42.277]  Or are we gonna put them in facilities and ship their asses back?
[01:52:42.457 --> 01:52:43.538]  But that's not even what I want.
[01:52:43.578 --> 01:52:44.339]  Then I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:52:46.738 --> 01:52:49.200]  And I'm going to explain this very calmly and very coolly.
[01:52:50.141 --> 01:52:55.506]  We have to have a coalition with Brazil and with Colombia who are already about to go to war with Venezuela.
[01:52:55.586 --> 01:52:56.426]  It's already collapsed.
[01:52:56.887 --> 01:52:58.808]  Millions are flooding in every few months to their countries.
[01:52:59.449 --> 01:53:00.830]  There's firefights, you name it.
[01:53:01.110 --> 01:53:02.532]  It's all over the news now down there.
[01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:06.772]  To stabilize and Maduro has to be removed.
[01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:07.673]  The U.N.
[01:53:07.713 --> 01:53:08.233]  isn't going to help.
[01:53:08.273 --> 01:53:10.235]  They're behind it orchestrating the whole damn thing.
[01:53:10.715 --> 01:53:15.198]  And we have to get them out and do it because they're running it as the base to collapse into the U.S.
[01:53:15.318 --> 01:53:17.159]  in this program just like the U.N.
[01:53:17.179 --> 01:53:19.841]  did the Arab Spring with Obama to collapse the Middle East into Europe.
[01:53:20.081 --> 01:53:25.205]  So I don't want to go down there for regime change like the other times and all the rest of it to get the damn oil.
[01:53:26.058 --> 01:53:32.423]  We have to go down there to stabilize that country because it's in northern South America and is already falling into our country.
[01:53:32.664 --> 01:53:35.026]  I don't trust the neocons to not sabotage it to blame Trump.
[01:53:35.466 --> 01:53:36.587]  I don't even like the idea.
[01:53:36.907 --> 01:53:39.289]  But it's way better than what we already have.
[01:53:39.569 --> 01:53:40.710]  Millions coming our way.
[01:53:40.931 --> 01:53:41.871]  Collapsed border.
[01:53:42.332 --> 01:53:45.635]  Babies being shoved through barbed wire because their countries have collapsed.
[01:53:46.255 --> 01:53:57.045]  We can't let the whole South collapse into bedlam and insanity and then engulf us with the Democrats and our open society opening the door in a Weatherman Communist U.N.
[01:53:57.085 --> 01:53:59.027]  plan from the 1970s.
[01:53:59.728 --> 01:54:01.730]  It has to be stopped now!
[01:54:05.410 --> 01:54:06.050]  And there you have it.
[01:54:07.111 --> 01:54:09.592]  And of course, the Russians and the Chinese are there.
[01:54:09.632 --> 01:54:11.512]  The Chinese are already putting a social score there.
[01:54:11.552 --> 01:54:12.333]  They're running the show.
[01:54:12.653 --> 01:54:17.955]  The Russians want their interest because they've sold a bunch of weapons to them and gold and a bunch of issues.
[01:54:18.015 --> 01:54:19.635]  And I'm not a rucifile.
[01:54:20.536 --> 01:54:24.917]  If we were pumping into the Russian border millions of people, Russia would have the right to go to war with us.
[01:54:25.438 --> 01:54:27.618]  So I'm going to tell Russia, I'm against going to war with you.
[01:54:27.839 --> 01:54:28.859]  I want you to be successful.
[01:54:29.119 --> 01:54:29.939]  Have your pipelines.
[01:54:29.979 --> 01:54:30.580]  Do what you want.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.340]  And fight the jihadis.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:33.981]  But get the hell out of there.
[01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:42.436]  Because I'm telling you, I'm telling you, the only move to make here pretty soon is to go in there and kill everybody.
[01:54:42.997 --> 01:54:46.299]  And I'm talking about the military bases and the leadership of that damn government.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:47.980]  Because that's the problem.
[01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:49.061]  Cut it off at the head.
[01:54:50.382 --> 01:54:52.544]  Cut off Soros and the State Department funding.
[01:54:52.744 --> 01:54:53.765]  Again, you want to blame the Russians?
[01:54:54.185 --> 01:54:56.047]  Our government's the number one funder of this!
[01:54:56.607 --> 01:54:58.448]  The Russia's not the problem!
[01:54:58.649 --> 01:55:00.350]  I'm saying Russia better get the hell out of it.
[01:55:01.771 --> 01:55:02.552]  And the Chai Koms?
[01:55:03.672 --> 01:55:05.354]  It's time to bloody their nose.
[01:55:06.803 --> 01:55:08.024]  Maduro is a monster.
[01:55:08.084 --> 01:55:09.504]  He's arresting all the political opposition.
[01:55:09.685 --> 01:55:10.405]  He's a pig.
[01:55:12.106 --> 01:55:12.846]  He's a criminal.
[01:55:13.286 --> 01:55:15.808]  They have a thousand people dying a day down there from starvation.
[01:55:16.648 --> 01:55:18.229]  You say, well that's not our thing to get involved in.
[01:55:18.409 --> 01:55:18.849]  I agree.
[01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.710]  It was overseas.
[01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:21.171]  It's on our border.
[01:55:22.051 --> 01:55:23.432]  It's a chain reaction on our border.
[01:55:23.952 --> 01:55:28.114]  And I'm not going to sit here and like a wimp and play games with this whole thing.
[01:55:28.735 --> 01:55:31.316]  Because as I got older, I learned the pieces of this whole puzzle.
[01:55:33.598 --> 01:55:34.698]  They're running their move on us!
[01:55:34.738 --> 01:55:36.199]  This is the takedown of the country, folks!
[01:55:36.899 --> 01:55:40.861]  And we either act and overthrow the Mexican president, or we've got to invade.
[01:55:41.681 --> 01:55:44.382]  Now, his country's totally lost, and a joke, and he's adding to it.
[01:55:44.603 --> 01:55:45.403]  I've been to Mexico.
[01:55:45.663 --> 01:55:48.904]  The Central American crime gangs are making Mexico even worse right now.
[01:55:49.184 --> 01:55:50.865]  He won't do a damn thing, because he's a globalist.
[01:55:51.185 --> 01:55:52.746]  He's getting paid off, and you know he is.
[01:55:53.306 --> 01:55:54.607]  And the Venezuela is the problem.
[01:55:55.267 --> 01:56:00.149]  Mexican leadership and Venezuelan leadership are enemies of humanity and of everybody in Latin America.
[01:56:00.549 --> 01:56:04.491]  They need to be dealt with, and dealt with right now, if anybody cares about civilization.
[01:56:04.651 --> 01:56:05.392]  And that's the end of it.
[01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:07.073]  All the games stop right here.
[01:56:07.273 --> 01:56:08.353]  The real world's happening.
[01:56:09.174 --> 01:56:14.176]  15,000 people a day, three times the previous record, are hitting the three major border sectors.
[01:56:14.657 --> 01:56:15.917]  That's just in El Paso, 15,000 alone.
[01:56:15.937 --> 01:56:16.418]  McAllen, 15,000 alone.
[01:56:20.441 --> 01:56:22.743]  That's 30,000 a day they're grabbing in Texas.
[01:56:22.983 --> 01:56:24.184]  They can't take care of them.
[01:56:24.384 --> 01:56:25.465]  It can't be dealt with.
[01:56:25.805 --> 01:56:26.545]  No one's there.
[01:56:26.565 --> 01:56:28.286]  People say, oh, we'll just be humanitarian.
[01:56:28.787 --> 01:56:29.187]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:56:29.207 --> 01:56:33.730]  The Democrats are taking them into their homes to be voters and to be a permanent underclass.
[01:56:33.850 --> 01:56:39.513]  All right, I'm going to go on a break, and I swear I'm going to Thomas and Jim and John and John and Dan.
[01:56:39.734 --> 01:56:40.654]  But I went ahead and said it.
[01:56:40.714 --> 01:56:41.815]  I'm not ashamed of saying it.
[01:56:42.115 --> 01:56:44.617]  I just want to say it right and get all my points out there.
[01:56:45.518 --> 01:56:47.179]  I feel really good about this.
[01:56:47.879 --> 01:56:52.422]  I don't trust the globalists in our government to sabotage it and blame Trump like Bay of Pigs.
[01:56:53.323 --> 01:56:55.204]  That's why they've got to sign on to it publicly.
[01:56:55.244 --> 01:56:56.544]  There's got to be press conferences.
[01:56:56.805 --> 01:56:59.186]  People say, oh, well, you've got to have a sneak attack.
[01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:00.907]  No sneak attacks!
[01:57:01.467 --> 01:57:05.269]  Massive multi-month buildup so they know we're coming and they'll leave.
[01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:11.233]  But if we wait much longer, they're going to foment the domino collapse in our country.
[01:57:12.827 --> 01:57:15.849]  And there's going to be stay-behind networks down there that are going to have to be dealt with.
[01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:18.791]  So, this is big-boy pants time for everybody out there.
[01:57:19.972 --> 01:57:21.333]  This is big-boy pants time.
[01:57:22.113 --> 01:57:26.056]  We put the big-boy pants on, or we let the globals collapse the whole hemisphere.
[01:57:26.496 --> 01:57:27.537]  They've already collapsed Europe.
[01:57:27.877 --> 01:57:28.778]  Their tourism's down 80%.
[01:57:29.918 --> 01:57:32.180]  Paris is like an open-air Islamic toilet.
[01:57:34.261 --> 01:57:36.603]  And I'm just, I'm not rolling over.
[01:57:38.430 --> 01:57:41.072]  And the President doesn't want to plunge the economy, but he just signaled.
[01:57:41.612 --> 01:57:43.074]  I'll plunge the economy to stop this.
[01:57:43.194 --> 01:57:43.434]  Yes.
[01:57:43.814 --> 01:57:44.715]  Shut the border.
[01:57:45.015 --> 01:57:45.716]  Seal it now.
[01:57:46.116 --> 01:57:47.557]  Declare a real emergency.
[01:57:47.617 --> 01:57:48.818]  Become the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:57:49.058 --> 01:57:49.879]  We'll be back with your calls.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:56.081]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[01:57:56.321 --> 01:57:57.821]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:57:57.881 --> 01:57:58.242]  Hello.
[01:57:58.402 --> 01:58:03.284]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[01:58:03.424 --> 01:58:04.145]  It's amazing.
[01:58:04.265 --> 01:58:08.527]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever.
[01:58:08.727 --> 01:58:12.969]  And the antihistamines sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never cause
[01:58:13.209 --> 01:58:14.750]  This is a known patent out of France.
[01:58:14.770 --> 01:58:22.074]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[01:58:22.155 --> 01:58:25.637]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[01:58:42.887 --> 01:58:46.288]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[01:58:46.428 --> 01:58:47.128]  It just works.
[01:58:47.328 --> 01:58:57.851]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[01:58:57.871 --> 01:59:00.452]  Pollen block works every single time.
[01:59:00.572 --> 01:59:01.692]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[01:59:01.752 --> 01:59:05.133]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[01:59:05.293 --> 01:59:07.434]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[01:59:07.494 --> 01:59:08.494]  It's very complex.
[01:59:08.514 --> 01:59:09.334]  They don't even know why.
[01:59:09.374 --> 01:59:12.675]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[01:59:13.255 --> 01:59:19.897]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[01:59:20.037 --> 01:59:21.757]  I go out and I do market research.
[01:59:21.897 --> 01:59:24.358]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[01:59:24.518 --> 01:59:25.878]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[01:59:26.178 --> 01:59:34.320]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a best-seller?
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:36.000]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:41.302]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[01:59:41.822 --> 01:59:42.362]  It's not here.
[01:59:42.802 --> 01:59:46.203]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[01:59:46.303 --> 01:59:47.603]  M4WarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:56.215 --> 01:59:59.878]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:59:59.918 --> 02:00:15.529]  The Globalists have collapsed.
[02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:23.115]  Central and South America.
[02:00:24.912 --> 02:00:27.413]  Giant waves are on their way.
[02:00:27.513 --> 02:00:30.613]  Programmed and brainwashed in re-education camps called U.N.
[02:00:30.653 --> 02:00:31.394]  emergency centers.
[02:00:32.474 --> 02:00:39.436]  We either stabilize the southern border, crack down on the Mexican leadership, the Venezuelan leadership, or we lose the country.
[02:00:39.476 --> 02:00:39.936]  This is it.
[02:00:40.296 --> 02:00:40.896]  Make no mistake.
[02:00:41.976 --> 02:00:43.317]  This is all defensive.
[02:00:44.417 --> 02:00:45.237]  One hundred percent.
[02:00:45.257 --> 02:00:50.238]  You notice I didn't support regime change in Syria.
[02:00:51.699 --> 02:00:52.479]  Didn't support it in Iraq.
[02:00:53.732 --> 02:00:57.258]  Didn't support the whole Ukrainian fiasco because the globalists started it.
[02:00:57.278 --> 02:01:00.103]  And the globalists started this against our country.
[02:01:00.684 --> 02:01:03.008]  Just like Russia stood up to the destabilization of Ukraine.
[02:01:03.817 --> 02:01:06.819]  And the attempt to drive the Russian population that's been there for 500 years out?
[02:01:07.459 --> 02:01:08.480]  We have to stand up now.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:13.963]  And just like Putin put troops into eastern Ukraine, we have to put troops in right now.
[02:01:13.983 --> 02:01:17.726]  Because it's right down there south of us, and we're already being hit by this.
[02:01:18.866 --> 02:01:25.791]  It's our issue, it's our sovereignty, and it's being done by design, 21st century, 5th generational warfare.
[02:01:25.811 --> 02:01:27.392]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to your calls.
[02:01:28.012 --> 02:01:29.193]  Thomas is active military.
[02:01:29.213 --> 02:01:31.074]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:32.314]  We're going to talk to Jim.
[02:01:32.354 --> 02:01:34.055]  First-hand accounts of migrants crossing.
[02:01:34.135 --> 02:01:35.156]  Active duty National Guard.
[02:01:35.196 --> 02:01:36.397]  Migrant crisis FEMA camps.
[02:01:37.317 --> 02:01:39.959]  A minister on the sleeping churches in China takeover.
[02:01:40.339 --> 02:01:41.239]  Retired police officer.
[02:01:41.259 --> 02:01:42.120]  Immigration family.
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:42.880]  Is Border Patrol.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.581]  Citizen on migrant crisis.
[02:01:44.621 --> 02:01:45.381]  Has lived in Mexico.
[02:01:45.421 --> 02:01:45.982]  El Paso.
[02:01:46.362 --> 02:01:47.763]  Worked at Border Patrol in California.
[02:01:47.803 --> 02:01:48.723]  What Trump needs to do.
[02:01:49.244 --> 02:01:51.725]  Let's go to Jake in Washington State first.
[02:01:51.805 --> 02:01:53.506]  Jake, thanks for calling and holding.
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:55.040]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:05.484]  I just wanted to say I think the number one thing President Trump could do is get the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to track the number of DUI deaths caused by illegal aliens.
[02:02:05.524 --> 02:02:07.325]  They're giving driver's licenses to everybody.
[02:02:07.645 --> 02:02:10.146]  They don't know who's causing these deaths anymore.
[02:02:10.506 --> 02:02:14.688]  And if you look at the cost of a two-vehicle accident with multiple people killed,
[02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:16.530]  No, I agree.
[02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:17.671]  We should punt the statistics.
[02:02:17.691 --> 02:02:19.213]  We spend like 200 billion a year on illegals.
[02:02:19.233 --> 02:02:19.833]  Let me ask you this.
[02:02:20.234 --> 02:02:34.390]  What about my point that we have to nip it at the bud, cut the UN funding, funding this, like Trump just did cutting the money to the Central American countries, and we've also got to cut the funding, you know, to these other leftist groups, and we're going to have to go into Venezuela.
[02:02:35.966 --> 02:02:40.189]  I absolutely believe you've got to cut the funding to send the message that this is intolerable.
[02:02:40.809 --> 02:02:44.291]  And the key thing is, is the costs are hidden to the American public.
[02:02:44.672 --> 02:02:47.413]  And you don't have to be an evil person to kill somebody as a drunk.
[02:02:47.734 --> 02:02:49.355]  You can just be a guy who went to a party.
[02:02:49.375 --> 02:02:52.276]  And let's just say it, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[02:02:52.296 --> 02:02:54.258]  It comes out, they just let them go and they run.
[02:02:54.478 --> 02:02:57.800]  I'm not trying to act tough here, calling for stopping Mexico.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:04.264]  But when Mexico lets people go through its country, not stay there, but attack us, invade us, we've got to do something.
[02:03:04.884 --> 02:03:06.366]  And Trump's talking about cutting funding.
[02:03:06.406 --> 02:03:07.006]  That's not enough.
[02:03:07.086 --> 02:03:07.687]  Seal the border.
[02:03:07.727 --> 02:03:09.088]  Yes, that'll put pressure on Mexico.
[02:03:09.108 --> 02:03:10.249]  But what about Venezuela?
[02:03:10.569 --> 02:03:13.312]  A fallen, corrupt group now bringing foreign troops in.
[02:03:13.985 --> 02:03:17.648]  I think the ultimate thing you could do is take the troops you'd put in Venezuela and put them on the U.S.
[02:03:17.708 --> 02:03:17.988]  border.
[02:03:18.288 --> 02:03:24.732]  Then the Venezuelan carnage and mayhem will end up in Mexico, and Mexico will realize this is intolerable.
[02:03:24.772 --> 02:03:29.916]  I know, but you understand that when the illegals crawl through the barbed wire holding babies up as human shields under law, they get to stay here.
[02:03:30.456 --> 02:03:37.481]  So the place you keep them is you stabilize Venezuela, who's got resources coming out the yin-yang, then that stops, that's where the whole U.N.
[02:03:37.501 --> 02:03:38.202]  thing is set up.
[02:03:39.022 --> 02:03:40.102]  So why would we sit there?
[02:03:40.122 --> 02:03:42.023]  It's kind of like not bombing the North in Vietnam.
[02:03:42.603 --> 02:03:46.744]  Oh, we're not going to bomb the factories in the North because we've got some, you know, deal at the UN.
[02:03:47.084 --> 02:03:48.284]  Blow the hell out of the North!
[02:03:48.684 --> 02:03:49.464]  So it's the same thing.
[02:03:49.564 --> 02:03:52.745]  Why are we having a war when the whole thing running in is just sitting there?
[02:03:53.525 --> 02:03:58.967]  Alex, you're a gift to this country from God, but I just think we've been running internal checkpoints in the United States forever.
[02:03:59.007 --> 02:04:00.667]  We ought to draw the line at our border.
[02:04:02.475 --> 02:04:03.255]  No, I agree with you.
[02:04:03.315 --> 02:04:14.398]  If we've got internal checkpoints, here's the thing, the immigration judges won't, we should, look, Southwest Airlines will fly somebody to Central America for 500 bucks, or South America for 600.
[02:04:14.518 --> 02:04:23.721]  I mean, I say we start chartering Southwest Airlines planes with federal marshals on it, handcuff these people, throw their asses on the airplanes, and take them there and dump them where they came from.
[02:04:24.341 --> 02:04:27.124]  I mean, because we've got to stop the giant dam breaking.
[02:04:27.484 --> 02:04:30.587]  There's nothing against having some immigration, but this is a tsunami.
[02:04:30.667 --> 02:04:32.409]  I mean, you get the point I'm making, right?
[02:04:32.429 --> 02:04:33.110]  Absolutely.
[02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:35.152]  God bless you for your intensity, Alex.
[02:04:35.432 --> 02:04:36.373]  This country needs it.
[02:04:36.693 --> 02:04:41.338]  Your vision is clear and your passion is so palpable, it's just incredibly
[02:04:43.714 --> 02:04:44.815]  Well, you are, Jake.
[02:04:44.835 --> 02:04:46.197]  You're more focused than I am.
[02:04:46.637 --> 02:04:47.979]  And I'm not trying to sound radical here.
[02:04:48.159 --> 02:04:49.180]  We're under radical attack.
[02:04:49.221 --> 02:04:52.144]  So I have to go all in and call for what others won't call for.
[02:04:52.765 --> 02:04:53.286]  I'm serious.
[02:04:53.326 --> 02:04:56.149]  We need a humanitarian emergency mission to Venezuela.
[02:04:56.309 --> 02:04:59.714]  They're under a damned dictator flooding us with giant masses of people.
[02:04:59.974 --> 02:05:00.975]  What are we gonna do, Senator?
[02:05:00.995 --> 02:05:01.296]  Take it?
[02:05:03.554 --> 02:05:08.900]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.

[02:06:11.365 --> 02:06:12.486]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:13.026 --> 02:06:17.790]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.022 --> 02:06:33.323]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:06:34.738 --> 02:06:38.459]  President Trump in a lot of speeches has said Russian troops need to leave, Chinese troops need to leave.
[02:06:40.659 --> 02:06:45.160]  I had said stay out of Venezuela, even though it's a dictatorship.
[02:06:46.181 --> 02:06:56.703]  But now they've organized the UN camps the last three years into Colombia to create a corridor because they're right there in northern South America.
[02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:59.964]  Central America is a very short little trick, a few hundred miles.
[02:07:01.650 --> 02:07:06.515]  You make that trek, you get up to Mexico, and now they just let the people right through.
[02:07:07.676 --> 02:07:08.757]  And I've been in Mexico.
[02:07:09.738 --> 02:07:16.924]  I have to have security now, and I went through an internationally recognized group and got a Federali, two different times.
[02:07:17.845 --> 02:07:20.007]  And they sit there and show me the police feeds, everything.
[02:07:20.027 --> 02:07:23.991]  I'm like, oh no sir, you don't want to be in Cancun, you want to be in another place.
[02:07:25.012 --> 02:07:26.973]  Look, and they showed me stuff that wasn't on the news.
[02:07:27.955 --> 02:07:30.296]  In fact, I've thought about getting one of the fellas on the air.
[02:07:30.336 --> 02:07:31.216]  He's willing to even do it.
[02:07:31.256 --> 02:07:32.517]  We're going to blur out his face.
[02:07:33.417 --> 02:07:35.798]  And I had my own security down there on top of it, obviously.
[02:07:36.718 --> 02:07:38.779]  And they were just showing me everything.
[02:07:38.819 --> 02:07:40.299]  And I even drove in a taxi to see it.
[02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:45.101]  And there was the steakhouse that I'd eaten at a year before, you know, that was closed.
[02:07:45.141 --> 02:07:46.182]  And everybody was robbed.
[02:07:46.242 --> 02:07:47.502]  And in armored vehicles.
[02:07:47.582 --> 02:07:50.863]  And Marines getting killed at night inside their hotel rooms.
[02:07:51.123 --> 02:07:53.484]  And Americans getting kidnapped and killed.
[02:07:53.524 --> 02:07:55.145]  I mean, multiple times a day.
[02:07:55.985 --> 02:07:59.487]  And I was staying in another resort, not in Cancun, but nearby, that doesn't have crime.
[02:08:00.207 --> 02:08:10.473]  And I talked to the police, and I talked to some of the folks, because this gentleman was friends with the Marines that were in somewhat control of the area.
[02:08:11.393 --> 02:08:18.217]  And he was talking to them, and they were just like, well, if you want to come to Cancun, you can come ride one of our armored vehicles with us, we'll take you to dinner.
[02:08:18.757 --> 02:08:21.999]  But they said, you know, we just lost a couple people yesterday, a couple people the day before.
[02:08:22.039 --> 02:08:23.580]  This is the Marines getting killed.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:28.002]  And there's troops all over the street when you land at the airport.
[02:08:28.122 --> 02:08:29.563]  I mean, I've been to third world countries.
[02:08:29.643 --> 02:08:31.865]  I've been in war zones, on the edge of war zones.
[02:08:31.885 --> 02:08:32.866]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:08:33.546 --> 02:08:35.588]  I've been in hurricane zones with the militaries on the street.
[02:08:35.648 --> 02:08:37.890]  And this is like, the police and military are like this.
[02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:42.353]  I mean, they've got their big heavy guns out, armored vehicles, motorcycles everywhere.
[02:08:42.373 --> 02:08:44.695]  And they said, oh, it's all over Mexico.
[02:08:44.795 --> 02:08:46.436]  It's Central America has invaded.
[02:08:46.456 --> 02:08:48.378]  Oh, we hope Trump can stop it.
[02:08:51.513 --> 02:08:55.876]  And they were talking about even areas that they lived in in Mexico that didn't even have bad crime are now really bad.
[02:08:55.896 --> 02:09:06.243]  They're like, oh, if you thought El Chapo was bad, and if you thought the Mexican cartels were bad, they said these Guatemalan and Honduran groups, they are so bad.
[02:09:06.283 --> 02:09:07.804]  He said, now we have the Venezuelans here.
[02:09:08.524 --> 02:09:09.165]  They don't care.
[02:09:10.025 --> 02:09:10.806]  They don't care.
[02:09:10.846 --> 02:09:17.630]  They'll give a key of cocaine to a 15-year-old kid in a machine gun and say, you're in charge of this area.
[02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:20.332]  Go shoot everybody in that restaurant, and the kid will go do it.
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:29.664]  So Mexico, which is on the high end of third world countries, you wouldn't think of that, but wealth wise, it's on the high end.
[02:09:29.684 --> 02:09:30.565]  A lot of nice areas.
[02:09:31.286 --> 02:09:34.048]  It is being overrun with Central Americans right now.
[02:09:34.329 --> 02:09:36.871]  And now they go, oh, and now, sir, the South Americans.
[02:09:38.312 --> 02:09:40.154]  You think, oh, that's just the Mexicans being elitist.
[02:09:40.695 --> 02:09:45.199]  No, Mexico is like 10 times safer than Venezuela or Guatemala.
[02:09:51.656 --> 02:09:52.517]  What is Trump going to do?
[02:09:53.278 --> 02:09:55.000]  We're just going to sit here and let the whole thing collapse?
[02:09:55.541 --> 02:09:55.781]  Good.
[02:09:55.981 --> 02:09:56.582]  Seal the border.
[02:09:56.682 --> 02:09:57.843]  Cut off the Mexican funding.
[02:09:58.244 --> 02:09:59.585]  Cut off all the Central American funding.
[02:09:59.605 --> 02:10:00.266]  He's starting to do it.
[02:10:00.366 --> 02:10:00.647]  Good.
[02:10:00.907 --> 02:10:01.347]  Thank God.
[02:10:01.387 --> 02:10:02.969]  Imagine if we had Hillary during all this.
[02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:04.111]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:10:05.410 --> 02:10:06.131]  Oh my gosh, I forgot.
[02:10:06.171 --> 02:10:06.952]  Jim's in Colombia.
[02:10:06.972 --> 02:10:07.832]  I should have gone to him first.
[02:10:07.872 --> 02:10:10.835]  Thanks for holding firsthand accounts of migrants crossing.
[02:10:11.216 --> 02:10:12.577]  Jim, what are you witnessing down there?
[02:10:12.597 --> 02:10:14.899]  Because obviously, we put a map up for those who don't know.
[02:10:15.299 --> 02:10:20.484]  You've got Venezuela in eastern, northern, northeastern South America.
[02:10:20.564 --> 02:10:21.625]  And they go right through.
[02:10:22.006 --> 02:10:27.211]  And basically, Colombia, as you know, is threatened war right now over the fact that the Venezuelan government's allowing this.
[02:10:29.105 --> 02:10:35.931]  Yes, but I'm not so sure that Colombia would actually go to war with Venezuela.
[02:10:37.092 --> 02:10:55.409]  That, I believe, came from Trump last week mentioning that President Duque here in Colombia had lied to him and said that he was going to cut down the flow of illegal drugs into America, but it's actually increased.
[02:10:56.601 --> 02:10:58.062]  That's my thought on that.
[02:10:58.302 --> 02:11:02.185]  Everything else, everything you're saying, you are spot on.
[02:11:03.005 --> 02:11:05.547]  I'm in a place called Bucaramanga, Colombia.
[02:11:06.167 --> 02:11:10.070]  I'm about six to seven hours from the border.
[02:11:11.451 --> 02:11:16.874]  In distance, I don't know how far I am, but you have to go up the mountain, down the mountain.
[02:11:16.954 --> 02:11:18.495]  It's just very difficult to travel.
[02:11:20.489 --> 02:11:40.882]  I know people that live in the border town of Cucuta, Colombia, and that's where you get the famous pictures that everybody in the United States are seeing, where they're blocking those huge bridge freeways in between Venezuela and Colombia.
[02:11:42.443 --> 02:11:45.085]  But people are still coming through there.
[02:11:45.891 --> 02:11:48.253]  How they're getting through, I don't know.
[02:11:48.273 --> 02:11:56.481]  I wouldn't put it past them just coming and walking around the barricades and just coming right over the bridge.
[02:11:57.421 --> 02:12:11.214]  I have met countless Venezuelans here, and around Christmas time, me and my wife were shopping in an area right close to Bucaramanga,
[02:12:11.713 --> 02:12:21.140]  And there were a lot of Venezuelans with satchels full, gym bags actually, full of Venezuelan bolivars, their currency.
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:24.702]  And I thought, well, I'm going to help these guys out.
[02:12:24.842 --> 02:12:31.827]  And I gave them some Colombian money in exchange for the, what I call communist money.
[02:12:32.288 --> 02:12:33.669]  And it is communist money.
[02:12:35.230 --> 02:12:38.412]  I took it home to my son, let him get on the computer.
[02:12:38.432 --> 02:12:41.114]  He thought he had a big stack of money for Christmas.
[02:12:42.117 --> 02:12:48.162]  And to teach him a lesson of how communism actually affects money.
[02:12:48.743 --> 02:12:49.964]  And he was astounded.
[02:12:50.024 --> 02:12:51.085]  He's 10 years old.
[02:12:51.945 --> 02:13:03.615]  I've met women, probably about five to eight women with children in another place close to here called Florida Blanca, Colombia.
[02:13:03.755 --> 02:13:07.238]  And that's where these people are hubbing up and they're giving help.
[02:13:08.211 --> 02:13:14.473]  What is happening is the men are going, they're going on, they're moving on towards the United States.
[02:13:15.714 --> 02:13:22.056]  And me and my wife would try to give money to any of these people that we see on the streets with children.
[02:13:23.076 --> 02:13:28.618]  And my wife is Colombian, and she speaks more fluent Spanish than me.
[02:13:29.498 --> 02:13:33.220]  But we've asked these ladies, where are your husbands out?
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:34.760]  Well, they went on.
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:37.221]  They've gone on towards America.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:41.721]  And we're waiting because there's groups that will help us.
[02:13:42.241 --> 02:13:43.922]  And then we're going to go later.
[02:13:44.062 --> 02:13:46.322]  So we're trying to survive until they send us.
[02:13:46.362 --> 02:13:47.283]  Oh, that's all public.
[02:13:47.323 --> 02:13:47.943]  It's the UN.
[02:13:47.983 --> 02:13:48.783]  It's all staged.
[02:13:49.123 --> 02:13:49.383]  Yeah.
[02:13:49.643 --> 02:13:50.924]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:13:50.964 --> 02:13:53.004]  Because Latin America is collapsing.
[02:13:53.845 --> 02:13:54.925]  North Africa is collapsing.
[02:13:54.945 --> 02:13:55.685]  The Middle East is collapsing.
[02:13:55.705 --> 02:13:58.106]  We're talking about not $10 million, but $50 million.
[02:13:58.126 --> 02:14:01.027]  We're talking about the end of our civilization as we know it here.
[02:14:02.707 --> 02:14:04.088]  You are exactly right.
[02:14:04.648 --> 02:14:07.889]  I am a hands-off consumer.
[02:14:08.757 --> 02:14:10.297]  Conservative libertarian.
[02:14:11.758 --> 02:14:15.638]  In this situation, we have no choice.
[02:14:15.778 --> 02:14:19.259]  We're either going to take care of the situation now.
[02:14:20.199 --> 02:14:33.662]  It's probably going to have to be an invasion or a huge, strong show of force out in the sea at the Colombian border or the Brazilian border or what have you.
[02:14:34.573 --> 02:14:38.795]  Uh, if we don't do it now, we're going to end up spending.
[02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:46.054]  Uh, there's going to be more bloodshed, more money spent if we don't correct the situation now.
[02:14:46.134 --> 02:14:48.396]  Well, 20 million illegal aliens is bringing the U.S.
[02:14:48.416 --> 02:14:51.398]  to its knees and driving down the wages and bankrupting everything.
[02:14:51.438 --> 02:14:55.060]  Imagine another 20, 30 million and they're all being brainwashed by the U.N.
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:55.661]  and shipped in.
[02:14:55.721 --> 02:14:56.821]  We must do it.
[02:14:56.861 --> 02:14:59.603]  Jim, I'm gonna go to more calls for the military and others that are holding.
[02:14:59.623 --> 02:15:00.684]  I really appreciate you calling.
[02:15:01.144 --> 02:15:03.186]  When we come back, Thomas is active military.
[02:15:03.626 --> 02:15:05.127]  Let's talk about the situation.
[02:15:05.707 --> 02:15:07.809]  Then we've got John is active National Guard.
[02:15:07.849 --> 02:15:09.650]  We go right to John, right to Thomas when we come back.
[02:15:10.170 --> 02:15:14.433]  And then we're going to go to everybody else, like Pastor Sam and Greg and everybody else that's holding.
[02:15:14.453 --> 02:15:17.175]  I'm going to try to go bam, bam, bam, but these calls are so informative.
[02:15:17.655 --> 02:15:18.296]  It's hard not to do.
[02:15:18.356 --> 02:15:19.316]  Just please remember this.
[02:15:20.737 --> 02:15:22.218]  This is why they don't want us on air now.
[02:15:22.919 --> 02:15:25.280]  They're going to make their move with false flags, mass shootings.
[02:15:25.601 --> 02:15:28.463]  They're going to make their move with imploded borders.
[02:15:29.343 --> 02:15:31.004]  They're going to make their move with assassinations.
[02:15:31.905 --> 02:15:33.126]  This is World War IV.
[02:15:34.547 --> 02:15:35.988]  World War III was the Cold War.
[02:15:36.008 --> 02:15:37.849]  This is the globalist war against the nation state.
[02:15:39.485 --> 02:15:44.227]  They've already lost their big plan for the current world government, but they're regrouping, trying to bring down the nation-states.
[02:15:44.247 --> 02:15:54.272]  So whatever you do, support that local AM or FM station, spread the word about the broadcast, and tell folks they can listen to the Forbidden Evil Pro-America broadcast.
[02:15:54.572 --> 02:15:59.855]  They can hear it for themselves, make up their own mind, at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:16:00.095 --> 02:16:01.115]  Please share those links.
[02:16:01.135 --> 02:16:01.676]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:03.076 --> 02:16:04.077]  I mean, I've explained this.
[02:16:04.397 --> 02:16:06.158]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of
[02:16:07.313 --> 02:16:16.078]  Social media last year saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid and they showed a video somebody else shot in another state and just said I did it.
[02:16:17.398 --> 02:16:23.642]  And by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted it, but the damage was done.
[02:16:25.090 --> 02:16:41.662]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here when you run with these Instagram headlines and these Vice headlines saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism and then it's for commenters or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:16:43.297 --> 02:16:45.439]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[02:16:45.459 --> 02:16:47.920]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[02:16:48.741 --> 02:16:49.882]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[02:16:49.922 --> 02:16:52.223]  We got some other folks about to get the hammer dropped on them as well.
[02:16:52.824 --> 02:16:55.025]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[02:16:56.486 --> 02:16:57.927]  All I have is you supporting us.
[02:16:59.008 --> 02:16:59.689]  That's all I have.
[02:17:07.554 --> 02:17:08.235]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:17:09.318 --> 02:17:13.101]  We are running a special right now that we've never run before.
[02:17:13.382 --> 02:17:18.086]  And even though, DNA Force overall is our most profitable product.
[02:17:18.206 --> 02:17:23.270]  And that's because people that know in the market what it is understand it's an incredibly good deal.
[02:17:23.350 --> 02:17:32.658]  The problem is only athletes and folks that are really into health understand BioPQQ, CoQ10 and other things like this that come from organically produced sources.
[02:17:32.878 --> 02:17:36.041]  The average person isn't into vitamins or minerals or supplements.
[02:17:36.221 --> 02:17:39.822]  And then only folks that are really into it know about how special it is.
[02:17:40.083 --> 02:17:49.506]  And so when they see us selling DNA Force Plus and the dosages of real PQQ and CoQ10, they go, it's $150 normally?
[02:17:49.666 --> 02:17:55.028]  When the lowest price leading competitors like $300 and people get it through medical clinics.
[02:17:55.168 --> 02:17:56.909]  Because it is a great nootropic.
[02:17:57.029 --> 02:18:01.891]  It's a great thing for the whole body, for all the cells, for the bones, for the DNA, for the telomeres, for the nerves.
[02:18:02.691 --> 02:18:07.433]  But people aren't ready to pay that, so they have synthetic PQQ and CoQ10 at the stores.
[02:18:07.513 --> 02:18:11.836]  It's still $50-$60 for a little bitty bottle, and the word is, the synthetic doesn't even get absorbed.
[02:18:11.996 --> 02:18:18.499]  So I set out to give you the best, and back when it was costing us $50-$60 a bottle, we were selling it for $110-$120 a bottle.
[02:18:18.579 --> 02:18:20.660]  We gotta get our money back and fund things.
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:28.284]  But I made a big enough deal to sign a contract out a few years to get a super discount on this, but now I gotta move a lot of it.
[02:18:28.364 --> 02:18:29.304]  So, it's normally $100 now.
[02:18:31.105 --> 02:18:31.966]  $110 or so.
[02:18:32.186 --> 02:18:36.367]  It's right now at InfoWarsStore.com selling for only $60.
[02:18:36.668 --> 02:18:40.049]  It's selling for $59.80 right now.
[02:18:40.509 --> 02:18:46.792]  97% reviews for DNA Plus, the new formula of DNA Force, because we made even stronger, by the way, but I made the better deal.
[02:18:46.892 --> 02:18:49.115]  So it's a great deal at $110 or so.
[02:18:49.315 --> 02:18:52.419]  It is unbelievably insane at $59.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:55.343]  And the money we do make obviously funds this operation.
[02:18:55.363 --> 02:18:57.666]  So, it's like X2 though, the good halogen.
[02:18:57.786 --> 02:19:00.049]  It takes a few weeks for you to notice the results.
[02:19:00.450 --> 02:19:02.352]  But if you'll just get a bottle and take it.
[02:19:02.873 --> 02:19:04.254]  You think carrots are good for your eyes?
[02:19:04.734 --> 02:19:06.295]  You think antioxidants are good for your skin?
[02:19:06.495 --> 02:19:09.096]  I mean, it's a joke what happens with this.
[02:19:09.177 --> 02:19:09.817]  And it's proven.
[02:19:09.837 --> 02:19:13.039]  You can say it slows the deterioration of the telomeres.
[02:19:13.119 --> 02:19:14.459]  That means they don't die as fast.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.000]  You can say that.
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:15.720]  Makes them last long.
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:16.601]  Half empty, half full.
[02:19:16.701 --> 02:19:17.541]  It does so much more.
[02:19:17.741 --> 02:19:27.607]  ELEV ATP, Ancient Pea Apple Extract, PQQ, CoQ10, Organic Reishi, Astragalus Root Extract, and even more incredible ingredients.
[02:19:27.807 --> 02:19:30.448]  It is 60% off and free shipping.
[02:19:30.568 --> 02:19:31.669]  And if you sign up for AutoShip,
[02:19:31.789 --> 02:19:34.330]  You can cancel any time, every month, every two months, whatever you want.
[02:19:34.350 --> 02:19:37.590]  You just pick the time there, you get an additional 10% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:42.351]  And there's so many other big deals going at Infowarrestore.com, but DNA Force really is special.
[02:19:42.511 --> 02:19:48.613]  This run at this current rate will sell out in about a week and a half, so this special's not gonna run too long, but I have another order coming in soon.
[02:19:48.633 --> 02:19:53.153]  It won't be sold out for six months this time, because again, I've signed the contract to have it come in as we need it.
[02:19:53.233 --> 02:19:54.954]  DNA Force Plus, you won't experience it.
[02:20:06.752 --> 02:20:09.494]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:10.375 --> 02:20:22.406]  You know, we're taking your phone calls on
[02:20:28.078 --> 02:20:35.382]  The fact that Trump tried to stabilize the border, he tried to get rational funding, he tried to get laws changed, he's not a dictator, and now the Border Patrol.
[02:20:36.303 --> 02:20:38.124]  I've been on there 25 years and never seen this talk.
[02:20:38.864 --> 02:20:39.785]  We're under red alert.
[02:20:40.405 --> 02:20:42.447]  We're getting three to four times the number we ever got.
[02:20:42.987 --> 02:20:43.987]  We're having to let people go.
[02:20:44.007 --> 02:20:44.988]  We don't want to do this.
[02:20:45.508 --> 02:20:46.609]  This is super dangerous.
[02:20:46.629 --> 02:20:48.370]  These are unaccompanied children.
[02:20:48.610 --> 02:20:49.070]  Red alert.
[02:20:49.591 --> 02:20:50.611]  Well, just do your job.
[02:20:50.651 --> 02:20:51.052]  Handle it.
[02:20:51.212 --> 02:20:53.133]  Oh yeah, you're one Border Patrol agent.
[02:20:54.414 --> 02:20:55.815]  For on average 200 people.
[02:20:56.735 --> 02:20:57.956]  Oh yeah, you're one guy.
[02:20:57.976 --> 02:20:58.937]  You're gonna handle 200 people.
[02:20:59.057 --> 02:20:59.697]  Give me a break.
[02:21:01.719 --> 02:21:02.319]  Give me a break.
[02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:05.661]  And it's this instant gratification.
[02:21:05.681 --> 02:21:08.203]  I'm not here to kiss the Border Patrol's ass, but they got a rough job.
[02:21:09.484 --> 02:21:16.808]  And I see the Republican pundits like, well Trump's got record catch and release.
[02:21:17.048 --> 02:21:17.569]  Uh, yeah.
[02:21:19.172 --> 02:21:21.553]  Because there's not beds, there's not judges, there's not infrastructure.
[02:21:22.114 --> 02:21:29.157]  So we better push the president to get the troops on the border, get that wall finished, and put pressure on Venezuela that is absolutely already collapsed.
[02:21:30.178 --> 02:21:33.299]  You got a collapsed country with how many people live in Venezuela?
[02:21:33.319 --> 02:21:33.940]  Let's look that up.
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:36.401]  And most of them are coming this way.
[02:21:38.922 --> 02:21:41.664]  We're not just going to be paying for them, they're going to be voting for the names of dead people.
[02:21:43.324 --> 02:21:44.365]  And most of them are communists.
[02:21:47.063 --> 02:21:49.285]  We have an active duty military guy just hang up.
[02:21:50.306 --> 02:21:54.089]  So I'm going to go to John in Mass, Active Duty National Guard, Migrant Crisis, FEMA Camps.
[02:21:54.430 --> 02:21:55.290]  Thanks for calling, John.
[02:21:55.331 --> 02:21:55.831]  I appreciate it.
[02:21:55.851 --> 02:21:56.351]  You're on the air.
[02:21:57.973 --> 02:21:58.633]  Alex, how are you?
[02:21:58.734 --> 02:21:59.594]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:21:59.835 --> 02:22:00.115]  You bet.
[02:22:00.135 --> 02:22:01.116]  What's your view on all this?
[02:22:02.416 --> 02:22:04.338]  Um, it's just ridiculous.
[02:22:04.698 --> 02:22:14.566]  And I believe it was your show that, uh, that brought up the FEMA camps where there was a congresswoman or somebody that mentioned, like, oh, we're building, well, it was End Games.
[02:22:15.086 --> 02:22:17.628]  Oh, we're building them for when the illegals come.
[02:22:17.648 --> 02:22:21.271]  So the illegals are here, and they ain't filling up the camps.
[02:22:23.233 --> 02:22:29.658]  And it's tough living up here in the Republic of Massachusetts, where even the Republican governor is a Democrat.
[02:22:31.852 --> 02:22:32.512]  Well, you're right.
[02:22:32.633 --> 02:22:35.474]  Notice that we've got all these non-violent offenders in prison.
[02:22:35.514 --> 02:22:36.395]  Trump's trying to fix that.
[02:22:36.955 --> 02:22:45.121]  But then smugglers, murderers, multi-time kidnappers are just turned loose by ICE because the judges let them go.
[02:22:46.181 --> 02:22:46.762]  The judges.
[02:22:46.822 --> 02:22:47.902]  What do we do about these judges?
[02:22:50.624 --> 02:22:51.945]  You can't.
[02:22:52.966 --> 02:22:54.727]  Long list of impeachment.
[02:22:55.787 --> 02:22:56.508]  It's ridiculous.
[02:22:56.588 --> 02:22:59.590]  I mean, you don't know what it's like being a conservative living in Massachusetts.
[02:23:01.053 --> 02:23:04.635]  And, like, for me working, I work as a contractor on the outside.
[02:23:04.875 --> 02:23:07.837]  I can't compete with all the illegals that are floating around here.
[02:23:11.439 --> 02:23:11.979]  It's insane.
[02:23:12.059 --> 02:23:13.080]  It drives down our wages.
[02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:13.840]  Raymond, against them.
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:14.620]  God bless you, John.
[02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:15.461]  I appreciate your call.
[02:23:16.802 --> 02:23:21.844]  My son, active duty police officer in Florida, that's another place massive amounts of illegals are showing up.
[02:23:22.265 --> 02:23:23.085]  What's your view on this?
[02:23:23.125 --> 02:23:23.725]  What should we do?
[02:23:23.785 --> 02:23:24.466]  What should Trump do?
[02:23:25.546 --> 02:23:25.726]  All right.
[02:23:25.786 --> 02:23:27.627]  First and foremost, Alex, how do you hear me?
[02:23:28.208 --> 02:23:28.508]  I can.
[02:23:29.508 --> 02:23:29.989]  OK, great.
[02:23:30.874 --> 02:23:34.418]  I think we should militarize the border until the wall gets erected.
[02:23:35.179 --> 02:23:42.227]  Once it's erected and Border Patrol does an assessment, they slowly demilitarize the border.
[02:23:42.988 --> 02:23:45.150]  So they stabilize it and demilitarize it.
[02:23:46.337 --> 02:23:48.898]  Until this thing is under control.
[02:23:49.138 --> 02:23:51.239]  And by the way, that's in the Constitution.
[02:23:51.259 --> 02:23:53.180]  The one place that's supposed to be militarized is your border.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:56.001]  That's your cell wall, your cell membrane.
[02:23:56.142 --> 02:23:58.302]  And the Border Patrol says it's collapsed now.
[02:23:58.723 --> 02:24:01.184]  And if they fully break it, we'll be just like Europe.
[02:24:02.324 --> 02:24:04.505]  Yeah, I think that that's the model.
[02:24:04.525 --> 02:24:13.389]  You look at the EU, that's the model for the new world order, so to speak, for one world government.
[02:24:15.393 --> 02:24:18.894]  Do the same, duplicate the same process in America.
[02:24:19.334 --> 02:24:21.895]  Massive migration with different cultures.
[02:24:22.735 --> 02:24:25.396]  They don't even have to import Arab people.
[02:24:25.616 --> 02:24:28.797]  Anything connecting to our country is going to be fair game.
[02:24:29.077 --> 02:24:36.419]  Can you believe that George Ramos, the head of the Democratic National Committee, just says, quote, nothing we can do to stop them, just open the borders?
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:40.441]  I mean, we're only getting the worst on average of these countries.
[02:24:40.481 --> 02:24:41.301]  They're collapsing.
[02:24:41.741 --> 02:24:43.022]  I mean, is he insane?
[02:24:44.102 --> 02:24:44.282]  Yes.
[02:24:45.146 --> 02:24:46.587]  And that's what they want.
[02:24:46.988 --> 02:24:48.669]  That's their game plan.
[02:24:49.229 --> 02:24:51.131]  They want crazy chaos.
[02:24:52.071 --> 02:24:54.073]  And we need to do whatever it takes to stop it.
[02:24:55.014 --> 02:24:57.576]  Just to shift gears a little bit, I do buy your products.
[02:24:57.676 --> 02:24:58.517]  I buy it quarterly.
[02:24:59.297 --> 02:25:04.441]  And I got an idea for a shirt, if you'd listen, if it's okay.
[02:25:04.581 --> 02:25:09.985]  I got all the InfoWars shirts, the main ones, like the ones that say InfoWars on it.
[02:25:10.546 --> 02:25:13.148]  InfoWars in the front, dot com, and on the back,
[02:25:13.735 --> 02:25:19.917]  Tomorrow's News Today and then InfoWars.com logo along with it in the back.
[02:25:19.997 --> 02:25:21.577]  I think that would be a great shirt.
[02:25:21.697 --> 02:25:22.457]  Oh, that's a great one.
[02:25:22.497 --> 02:25:23.357]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:25:23.677 --> 02:25:24.538]  What color do you want?
[02:25:25.478 --> 02:25:26.698]  Black and white would be great.
[02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:28.519]  That's a great color you guys have.
[02:25:28.639 --> 02:25:35.580]  Okay, so we'll do black and white with a... You want Tomorrow's News Today on the back with an InfoWars.com square logo.
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:36.440]  What do you want on the front?
[02:25:37.561 --> 02:25:40.722]  Just an InfoWars, the logo, InfoWars.com.
[02:25:41.302 --> 02:25:42.582]  Once people read it from the rear,
[02:25:43.411 --> 02:25:44.212]  What the hell is that?
[02:25:44.232 --> 02:25:48.395]  Tomorrow's news today and they'll go up to it and say, oh wow, Infowars.com and they'll...
[02:25:58.302 --> 02:26:01.363]  I just get thumbs up when I go because I'm in more of a Republican area than anywhere else.
[02:26:01.383 --> 02:26:04.064]  I don't care if people give me the middle finger if I'm out with it.
[02:26:26.451 --> 02:26:30.053]  You know, listen, two years ago, I didn't even know who George Soros was.
[02:26:30.553 --> 02:26:31.573]  I stumbled upon you.
[02:26:32.274 --> 02:26:35.535]  There's people depressed at work that Hillary was going to get in office.
[02:26:36.216 --> 02:26:47.421]  I think the thing that, you know, I just was woed by your RNC speech, the 1776 speech, that classic epic speech you did.
[02:26:47.461 --> 02:26:53.424]  I have an idea for a rally around time that Trump gets close to office.
[02:26:54.249 --> 02:26:56.451]  An Imp Wars Rally in Washington, D.C.
[02:26:56.511 --> 02:27:00.235]  with musical guests Ted Nugent and Sammy Hagar.
[02:27:00.875 --> 02:27:04.979]  And have some of the, you know, some special guests like Roger Stone.
[02:27:05.019 --> 02:27:07.101]  I'm sure I'll be cleared of everything by then.
[02:27:07.181 --> 02:27:07.922]  Oh, it'd be awesome.
[02:27:07.962 --> 02:27:08.762]  Let me throw this at you.
[02:27:09.761 --> 02:27:10.701]  Trump's turned the corner.
[02:27:10.741 --> 02:27:12.042]  We know his real approval rate is like 60%.
[02:27:12.182 --> 02:27:13.302]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:27:13.983 --> 02:27:15.223]  And good things are happening.
[02:27:15.263 --> 02:27:16.664]  But then we see him trying to break the border.
[02:27:16.704 --> 02:27:18.164]  He should have way more support.
[02:27:18.945 --> 02:27:20.345]  He should have way more support.
[02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:22.206]  He's actually trying to keep his promises.
[02:27:23.487 --> 02:27:27.668]  I just can't believe there's such a large contingent of Democrats.
[02:27:27.688 --> 02:27:29.569]  Democrats, to me, didn't used to be this crazy.
[02:27:29.949 --> 02:27:30.690]  What is your view?
[02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:32.090]  Or were they always that crazy, Mike?
[02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:33.071]  Because they've gone nuts.
[02:27:33.971 --> 02:27:38.713]  Well, on the Jimmy Carter era, because, you know, I can go remember as far as back then.
[02:27:39.724 --> 02:27:41.485]  Probably 11, but I still remember.
[02:27:41.505 --> 02:27:47.109]  I mean, you didn't, because the news wasn't so in your face as now.
[02:27:48.210 --> 02:27:56.955]  I think it was, you had, I always looked at them as a weak party, but they weren't as crazy as they are now that I noticed.
[02:27:56.995 --> 02:27:59.857]  And then Ronald Reagan was the man.
[02:27:59.897 --> 02:28:03.239]  I mean, how do you, how do you beat that?
[02:28:03.259 --> 02:28:05.061]  And then the Clintons came along.
[02:28:05.121 --> 02:28:07.102]  Nobody really knew who the Clintons were.
[02:28:07.162 --> 02:28:08.543]  I don't think you did until
[02:28:09.229 --> 02:28:10.409]  You start investigating them.
[02:28:10.429 --> 02:28:21.594]  What I've noticed, one thing about Hillary, most of the Democratic wives, or even presidential wives, they were very subservient, so to speak, where they didn't, you know, say much.
[02:28:22.234 --> 02:28:29.157]  I've noticed when they were on the campaign trail back in 92, I mean, she was going, she was aggressive, going, come on, join us!
[02:28:29.237 --> 02:28:30.758]  And I'm going, who's running for president?
[02:28:30.878 --> 02:28:32.538]  This lady or her husband?
[02:28:32.558 --> 02:28:33.819]  I'm going, this is always weird.
[02:28:34.912 --> 02:28:36.454]  They're definitely creepy bad people.
[02:28:36.494 --> 02:28:37.154]  Thank you for the call.
[02:28:37.475 --> 02:28:38.135]  Great points, Mike.
[02:28:38.155 --> 02:28:39.957]  I'm going to bam, bam, bam, take your calls.
[02:28:40.658 --> 02:28:46.143]  Sherry and, those have been on the longest, Eka and Pastor Sam and Greg and everybody else.
[02:28:46.464 --> 02:28:48.105]  We've taken some military and police calls.
[02:28:48.385 --> 02:28:52.189]  We've got Jim's up next in Dallas as a major in the Texas Guard.
[02:28:52.329 --> 02:28:55.933]  There's not many majors in that, but I don't want to get him in trouble, but it's what he said.
[02:28:55.973 --> 02:28:56.614]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:56.674 --> 02:28:57.695]  Infowars.com.
[02:28:57.715 --> 02:28:58.596]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:29:02.909 --> 02:29:05.931]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:29:06.291 --> 02:29:12.215]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:29:12.635 --> 02:29:18.479]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:29:18.819 --> 02:29:21.441]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:29:21.721 --> 02:29:29.230]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:29:29.250 --> 02:29:37.459]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:42.325]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[02:29:43.183 --> 02:29:46.785]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:29:46.985 --> 02:29:52.969]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[02:29:53.910 --> 02:30:02.795]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[02:30:03.335 --> 02:30:07.518]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[02:30:07.538 --> 02:30:09.299]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:12.177]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[02:30:12.198 --> 02:30:13.503]  It was the last run.
[02:30:13.523 --> 02:30:14.467]  It's been sold out for two months.
[02:30:15.558 --> 02:30:16.439]  How is X2 back?
[02:30:16.919 --> 02:30:20.521]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[02:30:21.002 --> 02:30:24.064]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage we couldn't get anymore.
[02:30:24.664 --> 02:30:34.691]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[02:30:34.771 --> 02:30:38.694]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[02:30:39.114 --> 02:30:40.255]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:30:40.675 --> 02:30:45.016]  You need to do research into Iodine and the Iodine Conspiracy for yourself.
[02:30:45.476 --> 02:30:47.257]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[02:30:47.697 --> 02:30:48.977]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[02:30:49.517 --> 02:30:51.778]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[02:30:52.338 --> 02:30:54.579]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[02:30:55.199 --> 02:30:58.700]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:01.981]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:05.614]  ...is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[02:31:05.814 --> 02:31:18.151]  So from our brain waves, to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[02:31:18.672 --> 02:31:21.193]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[02:31:21.753 --> 02:31:22.894]  So, iodine is amazing.
[02:31:22.934 --> 02:31:23.494]  It's important.
[02:31:23.514 --> 02:31:25.755]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[02:31:25.795 --> 02:31:26.316]  They'll hurt you.
[02:31:26.716 --> 02:31:27.396]  This is pure.
[02:31:27.696 --> 02:31:28.376]  This is clean.
[02:31:28.737 --> 02:31:29.517]  This is amazing.
[02:31:29.837 --> 02:31:31.838]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[02:31:31.878 --> 02:31:31.998]  So, X2.
[02:31:34.139 --> 02:31:36.821]  Our overall best-selling product is now back.
[02:31:37.101 --> 02:31:41.883]  X2 Original from the very first original manufacturer.

[02:31:53.290 --> 02:31:54.050]  It's already been bottled.

[02:33:06.307 --> 02:33:10.791]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.815 --> 02:33:23.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:47.970]  Well, America's in a fight for her life.
[02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:57.932]  We got a president who is trying to walk on landmines of not spooking the public, but at the same time preparing the country to defend itself.
[02:34:00.053 --> 02:34:01.373]  You know, I didn't even mention this story.
[02:34:01.393 --> 02:34:03.913]  It was on Infowars.com yesterday.
[02:34:05.654 --> 02:34:09.335]  Illinois' House passes bill requiring women African-Americans on corporate boards.
[02:34:10.835 --> 02:34:12.395]  Now, on the surface, that sounds real good.
[02:34:12.636 --> 02:34:13.076]  Oh, really?
[02:34:13.136 --> 02:34:13.996]  Help black people.
[02:34:14.036 --> 02:34:14.436]  Help women.
[02:34:16.528 --> 02:34:23.329]  Corporate boards saying if you have a corporation and then you create a board to govern it, you have to put certain people on it.
[02:34:23.909 --> 02:34:25.210]  That sounds pretty Nazi to me.
[02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:34.671]  You know, I don't think there's a lot of white people on the board of BET or the NAACP or a lot of Christians on the board of the ADL.
[02:34:35.331 --> 02:34:36.692]  Groups have free association.
[02:34:37.632 --> 02:34:42.332]  We're not going to ban a golf course or we're not going to ban a bank from having white people or black people at it.
[02:34:42.372 --> 02:34:45.053]  But, you know, if folks want to go create their own group,
[02:34:46.374 --> 02:34:51.217]  Whether it's the Polish American Association or, you know, whatever it is, that's what people do.
[02:34:51.978 --> 02:34:54.420]  This is dangerous and this will kill Illinois even faster.
[02:34:56.101 --> 02:34:58.242]  Then I got stories like this one up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:58.302 --> 02:34:59.183]  It's gotta go viral.
[02:35:00.284 --> 02:35:01.344]  Great examples of this.
[02:35:02.085 --> 02:35:03.506]  Jussie Smollett is a hero.
[02:35:03.686 --> 02:35:06.308]  Google improves Empire Actors search results.
[02:35:06.808 --> 02:35:13.693]  In a Don Salazar article, tech giant's preferential treatment of libs continues unabated.
[02:35:14.889 --> 02:35:18.713]  And it turns out they've put a bunch of fake results for him that he's a hero and a great guy.
[02:35:19.874 --> 02:35:22.436]  Just like Maxine Waters says, she's proud of him, he did a great job.
[02:35:28.122 --> 02:35:29.723]  So that's who they are, folks.
[02:35:30.244 --> 02:35:40.113]  The Democrats think they can do anything they want, whenever they want, and escape any type of scrutiny.
[02:35:41.584 --> 02:35:43.625]  That story's front and center at News Wars.
[02:35:44.325 --> 02:35:45.526]  There's a war on for the news.
[02:35:45.586 --> 02:35:46.506]  Newswars.com.
[02:35:47.847 --> 02:35:49.067]  Jesse Smollett's a hero.
[02:35:49.087 --> 02:35:50.288]  That's the top search result.
[02:35:51.148 --> 02:35:59.292]  You look at DuckDuckGo, it's an idiot, liar, suspect, joke, pathological liar.
[02:36:00.292 --> 02:36:02.053]  You go to Google, he's a hero.
[02:36:04.314 --> 02:36:05.414]  Think of the nerve of that.
[02:36:05.875 --> 02:36:10.937]  And then Sundar Pichai, right there while I'm in his face, gets in front of Congress.
[02:36:12.185 --> 02:36:14.207]  And says we've never fixed one search result.
[02:36:15.348 --> 02:36:15.568]  Ever.
[02:36:16.929 --> 02:36:17.610]  Well, that's funny.
[02:36:19.972 --> 02:36:22.133]  That's really hilarious if it wasn't so serious.
[02:36:26.457 --> 02:36:27.678]  Who's been on the longest here?
[02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:35.185]  Let's go to Pastor Sam in Texas.
[02:36:35.205 --> 02:36:35.565]  Go ahead.
[02:36:38.681 --> 02:36:46.063]  Alex, I just want to start by confirming everything that you said about Latin America and South America and Mexico today.
[02:36:46.644 --> 02:36:51.025]  I know time is going to limit us, so I'd just like to go to your most controversial point first.
[02:36:51.625 --> 02:36:56.367]  The Mexican president is absolutely a fraud.
[02:36:56.747 --> 02:36:58.147]  The election was a fraud.
[02:36:58.787 --> 02:37:06.970]  There were over 200 politicians assassinated in the run-up to this election, and I have personally approached three different Latin presidents about this.
[02:37:07.631 --> 02:37:14.377]  What we do in Venezuela is a dry run for what we are also going to have to do in Mexico.
[02:37:14.437 --> 02:37:15.338]  No, I totally agree.
[02:37:15.378 --> 02:37:16.058]  And the U.S.
[02:37:16.218 --> 02:37:17.780]  has had to invade Mexico three times.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:19.601]  And it's a constant problem.
[02:37:20.302 --> 02:37:23.104]  And the outgoing president was a patriot and worked with Trump.
[02:37:23.285 --> 02:37:24.766]  The new president is a socialist.
[02:37:26.539 --> 02:37:29.701]  And is a globalist and is working to openly collapse everything.
[02:37:29.741 --> 02:37:36.164]  So, they're invading us with drugs and murder and millions of people and letting it happen and bragging they're doing it.
[02:37:36.224 --> 02:37:37.865]  So, we'll see what happens.
[02:37:38.926 --> 02:37:39.746]  This is all U.N.
[02:37:39.806 --> 02:37:40.087]  run.
[02:37:40.247 --> 02:37:42.408]  All the Democratic Party is behind this.
[02:37:43.969 --> 02:37:47.531]  It's why you've seen the Democrats call MS-13 God's children.
[02:37:52.713 --> 02:37:53.994]  Thank you so much, Pastor Sam.
[02:37:54.014 --> 02:37:54.875]  I appreciate the call.
[02:37:55.982 --> 02:37:59.785]  We'll put the current Mexican president on screen for you and give you all his bio info for TV viewers.
[02:38:01.046 --> 02:38:02.507]  We put the wrong Mexican president up.
[02:38:02.808 --> 02:38:06.871]  That was the outgoing guy trying to actually help things and fix things, but there's a new guy in there.
[02:38:07.772 --> 02:38:09.433]  GM, yeah, there's the new guy right there.
[02:38:11.696 --> 02:38:13.797]  All right, let's talk to Jim in Dallas.
[02:38:13.937 --> 02:38:15.277]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:38:15.718 --> 02:38:17.418]  You work with the State National Guard.
[02:38:17.458 --> 02:38:18.659]  People think, oh, State Guard.
[02:38:18.919 --> 02:38:23.440]  That's like the creme de la creme of patriots, working with federal and state to try to defend the border.
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:26.001]  And Texas is the hot spot, so they're right in the middle of it.
[02:38:26.041 --> 02:38:27.262]  Jim, what are you witnessing down there?
[02:38:28.102 --> 02:38:29.343]  Well, let me correct you, Alex.
[02:38:29.423 --> 02:38:30.783]  I'm not in the National Guard.
[02:38:30.803 --> 02:38:31.824]  I'm in the Texas State Guard.
[02:38:31.844 --> 02:38:33.044]  Well, I said Texas State Guard.
[02:38:33.164 --> 02:38:33.724]  I think I said that.
[02:38:33.764 --> 02:38:35.545]  You missed a moment.
[02:38:35.665 --> 02:38:37.746]  I'm on Major General Boatish's staff.
[02:38:37.866 --> 02:38:40.607]  I'm the intelligence officer, or one of a couple, OK?
[02:38:41.314 --> 02:38:53.700]  We're working with Chief Randall Prince of the Texas Rangers right now and activating, of course, the Ranger Reconnaissance Team at the Border Security Operations Center.
[02:38:54.180 --> 02:39:02.144]  And from our side of it, we're centralizing at the 39th Composite Regiment, that's Texas State Guard, in El Paso.
[02:39:03.404 --> 02:39:09.027]  Don't think that we're going to wait for the federal government to protect the state of Texas.
[02:39:09.835 --> 02:39:29.323]  Okay, you've got aviation units up there in Marshall that are coming down to the border, and if the feds aren't going to do their job, just like Colonel Travis admonished us in every one of our offices, we have a quote from Colonel Travis on the wall about protecting ourselves against outside aggression.
[02:39:30.264 --> 02:39:32.384]  We're better at this than the federal government.
[02:39:33.065 --> 02:39:38.407]  The Border Patrol's not doing their job, and the state of Texas will protect
[02:39:38.959 --> 02:39:43.503]  The residents of the state... Well, Jim, let me be clear, because my audio cuts out.
[02:39:43.523 --> 02:39:48.828]  No, I was saying the best people from the military, the state guard, the federal government are in the Texas Guard.
[02:39:48.968 --> 02:39:49.949]  I know you're Texas Guard.
[02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:53.472]  I know the main attack is happening in Texas, Arizona, and California.
[02:39:53.492 --> 02:39:55.554]  I know the governor has said they're going to defend.
[02:39:56.255 --> 02:40:02.400]  But we're talking about just in El Paso, they were saying $15,000 now a day instead of $3,000 being the previous record.
[02:40:02.841 --> 02:40:05.062]  I understand you're doing a great job, but how do you deal
[02:40:05.703 --> 02:40:11.486]  With a flood of something like that, and I'm glad to hear you guys are fired up and, you know, out in the open.
[02:40:11.726 --> 02:40:17.809]  I mean, that's good news, but give us your view on just how serious this is, and then give us that Colonel Travis quote.
[02:40:19.130 --> 02:40:22.331]  Well, I can't quote exactly, but we've got them on our walls.
[02:40:22.351 --> 02:40:25.153]  There's 25 quotes that are in every office.
[02:40:25.193 --> 02:40:34.237]  What I'm saying is, this isn't getting a lot of attention, but the Attorney General, Attorney General Paxson, and the Governor, Governor Abbott,
[02:40:34.631 --> 02:40:36.692]  Have called up the Texas State Guard unit.
[02:40:37.493 --> 02:40:43.656]  We've been in contact with Hood and Bliss, and the Adjutant's office there isn't talking to us.
[02:40:44.437 --> 02:40:44.837]  Okay?
[02:40:45.057 --> 02:40:46.518]  For some unknown reason.
[02:40:46.978 --> 02:40:50.240]  Now, Major General Boatish is the commander of all Texas forces.
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:55.523]  The Texas National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard, and the Texas State Guard.
[02:40:56.132 --> 02:40:58.833]  And he's activating members of the Texas State Guard.
[02:40:59.234 --> 02:41:02.255]  And the next step is the Texas National Guard.
[02:41:02.575 --> 02:41:05.697]  But that's got to be approved from Washington.
[02:41:06.177 --> 02:41:07.878]  Well, we don't have time for that, Alex.
[02:41:08.598 --> 02:41:09.639]  And I'll tell you something else.
[02:41:10.199 --> 02:41:14.621]  The next step is the authorization of lethal force by the governor.
[02:41:15.001 --> 02:41:19.484]  We're not going to wait for anybody above the governor because our state's under attack, Alex.
[02:41:20.224 --> 02:41:24.066]  And if we've got to remove illegals from our state,
[02:41:24.784 --> 02:41:26.165]  And send them to another state?
[02:41:26.725 --> 02:41:28.166]  Or send them back to Texas?
[02:41:28.267 --> 02:41:29.407]  Or back to Mexico?
[02:41:29.427 --> 02:41:35.152]  Because you know, Alex, that the Rangers have the same power as United States Marshals.
[02:41:35.672 --> 02:41:39.555]  They can deport people straight back over to the Mexican provinces.
[02:41:39.895 --> 02:41:46.860]  Whether the Mexican governors of those provinces are going to be cooperative or not, they're not coming into Texas.
[02:41:47.841 --> 02:41:53.905]  And the governor is a hair's breadth away from authorizing deadly force to be used
[02:41:54.372 --> 02:42:03.677]  Well that's because we know there's, talk about that, there's all these armed coyotes that have been shooting and killing people and let's explain.
[02:42:04.158 --> 02:42:10.141]  The beds are overwhelmed, the feds are overwhelmed, the border patrol is overwhelmed, the Democrats are saying just capitulate.
[02:42:10.401 --> 02:42:17.085]  If we let them break the border, literally 20% of Latin America in the next few years will spill in.
[02:42:17.685 --> 02:42:18.806]  This will be the end of the country.
[02:42:18.866 --> 02:42:20.467]  I mean this is ending our sovereignty.
[02:42:20.827 --> 02:42:22.388]  This is the new world war right now.
[02:42:23.444 --> 02:42:27.108]  Well, Alex, we just had a staff meeting in Austin this morning.
[02:42:27.428 --> 02:42:30.871]  And like I said, the Texas State Guard has been activated.
[02:42:31.372 --> 02:42:33.954]  Colonial members deploying to the border.
[02:42:34.615 --> 02:42:46.046]  And the next step, if the Border Patrol and the feds do not do something about this, the next step is all of the Governor Abbott is going to authorize lethal force to prevent
[02:42:46.970 --> 02:42:51.471]  Don't hang up, Jim.
[02:42:52.032 --> 02:43:00.054]  Tell us a little bit more about what you're hearing when we come back, then we'll cram in more phone calls.
[02:43:00.094 --> 02:43:01.715]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[02:43:03.055 --> 02:43:04.075]  I mean, I've explained this.
[02:43:04.375 --> 02:43:16.099]  It's one thing to ban me on a bunch of social media last year, saying that I beat up a 10-year-old kid, and then they showed a video somebody else shot in another state, and just said I did it.
[02:43:17.408 --> 02:43:23.670]  And, by the time they banned me everywhere, Forbes, who first reported it, took it down and retracted, but the damage was done.
[02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:41.654]  But if you think I'm gonna sit here, when you run with these Instagram headlines, and these Vice headlines, saying Alex Jones to be taken off Instagram for anti-Semitism, and then it's for commenters, or for somebody's art, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:43:43.297 --> 02:43:45.420]  And so, the letters are gonna be sent out Monday.
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:47.923]  I've already got the lawyers engaged.
[02:43:48.764 --> 02:43:49.905]  And we're gonna drop the hammer on you.
[02:43:49.946 --> 02:43:52.228]  We got some other folks about to get their hammer dropped on them as well.
[02:43:52.829 --> 02:43:55.012]  They're not stopping because they got Soros money.
[02:43:56.514 --> 02:43:57.956]  All I have is you supporting us.
[02:43:59.017 --> 02:43:59.658]  That's all I have.

[02:46:04.453 --> 02:46:04.894]  Go ahead.
[02:46:05.174 --> 02:46:07.396]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:46:07.416 --> 02:46:10.458]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:46:11.258 --> 02:46:12.379]  It just gets old, man.
[02:46:12.679 --> 02:46:14.401]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:46:15.101 --> 02:46:17.183]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:46:17.423 --> 02:46:21.406]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:46:21.426 --> 02:46:23.868]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:46:24.728 --> 02:46:27.050]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:28.491]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:46:28.771 --> 02:46:29.652]  Us being shut down?
[02:46:29.892 --> 02:46:30.933]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:46:31.353 --> 02:46:32.414]  You know what, Alex?
[02:46:32.434 --> 02:46:33.515]  Put him on pause again.
[02:46:33.535 --> 02:46:34.375]  Hey, Frank!
[02:46:34.635 --> 02:46:39.999]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:44.583]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:46:44.823 --> 02:46:47.705]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:46:47.965 --> 02:46:48.345]  You understand?
[02:46:48.425 --> 02:46:49.706]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:46:50.067 --> 02:46:51.187]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:46:52.168 --> 02:46:57.130]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.751]  Do you understand?
[02:46:58.771 --> 02:47:00.091]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:47:06.234 --> 02:47:08.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.801 --> 02:47:20.223]  Again, this is Alex Jones here.
[02:47:20.243 --> 02:47:21.945]  If you just joined us, the station's joining us.
[02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:24.629]  I want to be clear.
[02:47:26.658 --> 02:47:29.559]  The Border Patrol's estimating 100,000 people a day are trying to get in.
[02:47:29.979 --> 02:47:38.643]  They've got up to 15,000 people, triple the number they've ever seen, at two border checkpoints in Texas, one in Arizona, and then one in California.
[02:47:38.663 --> 02:47:39.963]  So I was saying three earlier, that's four.
[02:47:40.863 --> 02:47:45.205]  So yesterday it was 45,000 a day, it's four checkpoints responding in that number.
[02:47:46.086 --> 02:47:48.026]  My God, it's up at 60,000 a day now.
[02:47:49.487 --> 02:47:51.588]  And these are armed men bringing many of them in, so...
[02:47:52.904 --> 02:47:55.105]  This is becoming just hysteria.
[02:47:55.145 --> 02:48:04.870]  And you heard the Major with the Texas Guard saying that this is being escalated up to be able to defend themselves because they're getting shot at.
[02:48:06.471 --> 02:48:10.293]  And so they branded all this, that these heroes are trying to get into the country.
[02:48:11.393 --> 02:48:14.275]  This has become a really, really, really, really serious crisis.
[02:48:15.373 --> 02:48:18.396]  I'm going to take calls this segment and the next, and then Mike Adams is coming up.
[02:48:18.456 --> 02:48:21.138]  But the second segment of the next hour, I'm going to re-air a piece.
[02:48:21.158 --> 02:48:23.300]  Can we put that article on screen for TV viewers, please?
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:26.242]  That's from October 21st of last year.
[02:48:27.003 --> 02:48:30.846]  Hard to believe already like four or five months ago, almost six months ago.
[02:48:31.447 --> 02:48:34.369]  Meet the 600 million man UN invasion force.
[02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:38.372]  And I show all the documents, all the admissions, the UN saying we're going to do this.
[02:48:39.153 --> 02:48:44.816]  And I explained how by next year, if we don't stop this invasion force, it will encourage the next invasion force.
[02:48:45.336 --> 02:48:46.416]  This is so critical.
[02:48:47.217 --> 02:48:50.098]  We'll have it reposted to the main page of Infowars.com.
[02:48:50.118 --> 02:48:52.579]  We'll restream it before Mike Adams comes on live.
[02:48:52.839 --> 02:48:55.501]  So Jim and Dallas, you're all amped up and that's good.
[02:48:56.505 --> 02:48:58.046]  And we are coming down to make it or break it.
[02:48:58.687 --> 02:49:00.568]  I'm not somebody that ever wants to invade countries.
[02:49:00.988 --> 02:49:03.890]  But Venezuela is a dictatorship with the U.N.
[02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:07.853]  as the main base to flood Colombia and then right into Central America.
[02:49:07.873 --> 02:49:09.013]  They admit they're running it.
[02:49:09.314 --> 02:49:10.054]  So we cut U.N.
[02:49:10.094 --> 02:49:10.394]  funding.
[02:49:10.434 --> 02:49:12.396]  We cut Central American funding, which Trump just did.
[02:49:12.816 --> 02:49:13.877]  We cut Mexican funding.
[02:49:13.917 --> 02:49:14.717]  We closed the border.
[02:49:15.638 --> 02:49:22.042]  And then we stopped playing games with the Democrats who were involved in government and the State Department still orchestrating this.
[02:49:22.122 --> 02:49:24.484]  I mean, that's this is make it or break it.
[02:49:24.524 --> 02:49:25.825]  This this is this is the real threat.
[02:49:25.845 --> 02:49:26.265]  What do you think?
[02:49:27.586 --> 02:49:29.547]  Well, Alex, I agree with you entirely.
[02:49:29.627 --> 02:49:43.455]  In fact, Major General Bodish today, he's the head of the Texas Military Department, Adjutant General, sent out orders for the Texas State Guard to the 1st and 2nd Regiments.
[02:49:44.056 --> 02:49:52.001]  So we're going to have armed members of the Texas State Guard down in McAllen and over in El Paso by 1800 tonight.
[02:49:52.721 --> 02:49:54.362]  This is coming to a breaking point.
[02:49:54.963 --> 02:50:02.607]  The Camp Mabry is going to be setting up a tactical headquarters down in McAllen and in El Paso.
[02:50:03.087 --> 02:50:11.171]  So, if the federal, like I stated previously, if the federal government is not going to defend Texas, Texans are going to defend Texas.
[02:50:11.611 --> 02:50:14.372]  And we're not waiting for the federal government to do anything.
[02:50:14.652 --> 02:50:18.094]  And I can tell you right now that the Reds, the 4th and the 8th,
[02:50:18.797 --> 02:50:23.118]  And the 19th Regiment of the Texas State Guard will be there within 72 hours.
[02:50:23.499 --> 02:50:25.279]  And we're not going with rubber bullets.
[02:50:25.859 --> 02:50:27.480]  We're being issued live rounds.
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:38.184]  We will not let the federal government let Texas be invaded by a tidal wave of disease-carrying illegal aliens.
[02:50:38.404 --> 02:50:41.004]  And yes, we use the term illegal aliens.
[02:50:41.025 --> 02:50:44.366]  And they're also smuggling, and that's been confirmed in the Senate report and everything.
[02:50:44.386 --> 02:50:45.246]  So let me ask you this, though.
[02:50:47.190 --> 02:50:50.771]  Notice the Border Patrol, Friday, said, red alert, we've been overwhelmed, we need help.
[02:50:50.811 --> 02:50:53.892]  So they're good people, obviously, and Trump's trying.
[02:50:53.932 --> 02:50:56.333]  He's just acting within the confines of Congress.
[02:50:56.353 --> 02:50:58.414]  He wanted, you know, ten billion dollars.
[02:50:58.674 --> 02:50:59.834]  He got 1.3 billion.
[02:51:00.854 --> 02:51:03.395]  I'm just saying he should declare an emergency, a law enforcement emergency.
[02:51:03.435 --> 02:51:06.936]  He should declare a commander-in-chief emergency, and then he can do whatever he wants.
[02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:08.117]  I mean, this is the border.
[02:51:08.317 --> 02:51:10.357]  This is where presidents have dictator powers.
[02:51:11.558 --> 02:51:14.979]  Well, Alex, you know as the lifelong Texan, as am I,
[02:51:16.314 --> 02:51:24.784]  When you see the Rangers start wearing their tactical uniforms, which is the olive drab, you know that we're not fooling around.
[02:51:25.505 --> 02:51:32.073]  And it's just a sad situation that the state of Texas pays 18% of all federal taxes.
[02:51:32.754 --> 02:51:38.335]  And we can't get one cavalry soldier from Hood to come down and protect the border.
[02:51:38.715 --> 02:51:53.279]  It's not the responsibility of the state of Texas under our current constitutional setup for Texas to have to appropriate $5.2 billion to build a wall in our state because Congress in Washington can't get it done.
[02:51:53.799 --> 02:52:01.541]  But I'm here to tell you, like you've said on several occasions, real men are bred in Texas in the history of Colonel Travis.
[02:52:02.839 --> 02:52:10.503]  And you will not take our liberty, and the people of the state of Texas have an organization that will defend that Lone Star flag.
[02:52:10.803 --> 02:52:14.605]  No, I agree with you, but I'm just telling you, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:52:15.085 --> 02:52:19.888]  We need to be suing Beto, who openly smuggled a bunch of groups for child smuggling.
[02:52:19.948 --> 02:52:21.329]  We know he helps smuggle kids in.
[02:52:21.669 --> 02:52:22.609]  He brags about it.
[02:52:22.929 --> 02:52:29.333]  Just like Jack Posobiec tweeted it, or Jorge Ramos, and said, oh, you say open the border, you support child smuggling.
[02:52:29.773 --> 02:52:31.195]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:52:31.255 --> 02:52:36.623]  We need to target, legally and lawfully, but no more games, the leadership of the Democratic Party.
[02:52:36.944 --> 02:52:37.925]  The gloves are off.
[02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:42.571]  Believe me, they are tearing the hell out of me behind the scenes with non-conventional operations.
[02:52:43.012 --> 02:52:44.212]  And so you guys are doing a great job.
[02:52:44.252 --> 02:52:44.973]  We'll pray for you.
[02:52:45.373 --> 02:52:45.793]  You're right.
[02:52:45.873 --> 02:52:47.814]  Hundreds of thousands are already headed this way.
[02:52:47.855 --> 02:52:48.855]  Hundreds of thousands have hit.
[02:52:49.435 --> 02:52:53.278]  And I'm just glad that the folks in our Texas Guard are awake.
[02:52:53.378 --> 02:52:55.299]  And I'm glad the governor, who's a great patriot, is awake.
[02:52:56.079 --> 02:52:58.361]  But this is the plan to implode the country.
[02:52:58.421 --> 02:53:02.263]  So everybody should really, really be pushing for Trump to take action.
[02:53:02.303 --> 02:53:04.785]  Just in closing, what would you like to see the president do?
[02:53:06.243 --> 02:53:12.606]  Well, before I get to the President, the Attorney General, Kenny Paxson, is not sitting on his hands, Alex.
[02:53:13.007 --> 02:53:18.029]  The stuff that you just suggested, and you know, you've spoken off the record with Attorney General Paxson.
[02:53:18.049 --> 02:53:20.411]  Well, let's not get these people in trouble, but yeah, they're patriots.
[02:53:20.431 --> 02:53:30.656]  No, but you know that the legal side of the House, that he's as much a fighter as you and I are in the field, as much or more so of a patriot, good man from Plato, Texas.
[02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:33.191]  And he's going to take care of that side.
[02:53:33.331 --> 02:53:35.293]  Alex, we're not laying down for this.
[02:53:35.653 --> 02:53:36.673]  We're up on our high knees.
[02:53:36.693 --> 02:53:38.014]  No, I understand, because this is it.
[02:53:38.054 --> 02:53:40.296]  They're breaking the country right now.
[02:53:40.796 --> 02:53:45.159]  We just, I'm just saying, and I agree, let's deal with the big threat, the wave.
[02:53:45.259 --> 02:53:46.239]  Who sent the wave?
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:50.302]  Because I just really want to, I really want those people to get in some trouble.
[02:53:50.362 --> 02:53:51.062]  God bless you, Jim.
[02:53:51.663 --> 02:53:53.984]  Folks, that's why I tell you, we're not just hyping this crisis up.
[02:53:55.145 --> 02:53:56.405]  Trump can act like it's not a crisis.
[02:53:56.445 --> 02:53:57.066]  He's not doing that.
[02:53:58.252 --> 02:54:01.494]  Well, first of all, Ronald Reagan said a nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.
[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:28.261]  We are not controlling our borders.
[02:54:28.321 --> 02:54:30.662]  We have not been controlling our borders for some time.
[02:54:32.383 --> 02:54:37.006]  Being a police officer, I've had incidences where I've come across people that were from out of the country.
[02:54:37.206 --> 02:54:38.167]  You check the passports.
[02:54:38.227 --> 02:54:38.847]  There's no U.S.
[02:54:38.907 --> 02:54:41.909]  ports of entry stamps in their passports.
[02:54:42.089 --> 02:54:48.052]  You call ICE, you call immigration, and immigration says we don't have the manpower to come down and bring these people in.
[02:54:48.473 --> 02:54:50.794]  And this was a small town in the middle of D.F.E.
[02:54:51.595 --> 02:54:51.995]  We need to
[02:54:53.436 --> 02:54:54.697]  Bolster those ranks.
[02:54:54.757 --> 02:55:03.842]  We need to give the money to immigration, to these law enforcement agencies down along the border, down in Texas, to get the personnel that they need to do to protect our border.
[02:55:04.062 --> 02:55:06.764]  If we have to use the military to do it, we need to use the military to do it.
[02:55:06.864 --> 02:55:09.005]  No, I agree, but I'm saying, we've been talking about this forever.
[02:55:09.125 --> 02:55:09.745]  It's here now.
[02:55:10.246 --> 02:55:12.527]  They're getting $15,000 a day in El Paso.
[02:55:13.247 --> 02:55:14.688]  The previous record was $3,000.
[02:55:15.569 --> 02:55:16.389]  It's all broken.
[02:55:16.890 --> 02:55:17.850]  Everything's overwhelmed now.
[02:55:18.170 --> 02:55:19.151]  The border has fallen.
[02:55:20.652 --> 02:55:22.093]  Yes, yes, without a doubt.
[02:55:22.533 --> 02:55:33.000]  But the thing about it is, is we also need to be looking at our own federal government and the people that are supporting SORUS, and the people that are supporting this, need to be kicked out of office.
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:34.440]  They need to have charges against them.
[02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:35.141]  No, I agree.
[02:55:35.221 --> 02:55:36.061]  The games are over.
[02:55:36.081 --> 02:55:41.965]  I mean, it's either roll over and die, or we start legally and lawfully going after all of them.
[02:55:42.245 --> 02:55:43.766]  And they're all plum targets.
[02:55:43.806 --> 02:55:44.927]  We've got their ass.
[02:55:46.513 --> 02:55:51.539]  The other issue is a lot of Soros' business is conducted down in South America.
[02:55:51.559 --> 02:55:57.665]  If you look at a lot of his companies, a lot of the companies that he owns or has interest in are based out of South America.
[02:55:57.966 --> 02:55:58.346]  Of course.
[02:56:01.930 --> 02:56:03.131]  So what do you think we should do, Ike?
[02:56:04.553 --> 02:56:05.434]  We need to build the wall.
[02:56:05.614 --> 02:56:06.695]  We need a controller border.
[02:56:06.896 --> 02:56:08.017]  We need to have a way
[02:56:08.823 --> 02:56:25.324]  To legally vet these people if they want to come to the country and make sure that we're not getting the scum of the earth in our country, that these people are coming here that are going to not harm our citizens, show allegiance to the American flag, come here to try to make a better life for themselves and their families.
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:30.581]  And we need to have a legal way to do it instead of just opening the doors, letting them in and giving them this welfare.
[02:56:30.601 --> 02:56:32.662]  We need to take welfare that we're giving these illegal immigrants.
[02:56:32.702 --> 02:56:33.162]  Exactly.
[02:56:33.222 --> 02:56:36.503]  We need to put that towards our infrastructure and our soldiers who are homeless.
[02:56:36.724 --> 02:56:39.044]  Oh, the UN admits it's a plan to collapse us.
[02:56:39.104 --> 02:56:40.845]  I mean, that's why it's cut and dry.
[02:56:41.425 --> 02:56:42.926]  And the people, they're just chattel.
[02:56:44.446 --> 02:56:45.206]  It's very, very sad.
[02:56:45.246 --> 02:56:46.447]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:56:47.427 --> 02:56:47.707]  All right.
[02:56:47.747 --> 02:56:50.128]  I've still got unlimited phone calls here.
[02:56:51.609 --> 02:56:53.389]  And we're going to talk about it all when we come back.
[02:56:53.529 --> 02:56:55.530]  And then I'm going to air the special report from October.
[02:56:56.257 --> 02:56:57.297]  How many months ago was that?
[02:56:58.218 --> 02:56:59.318]  Three, four, five months ago.
[02:56:59.338 --> 02:57:02.919]  And again, people say, well, how do you know what's going to happen?
[02:57:03.039 --> 02:57:09.321]  I'm not smart, but I have learned, like, when the globalists write in white papers what they're going to do and then it happens?
[02:57:09.601 --> 02:57:14.522]  It's like, they've got an operation here.
[02:57:15.602 --> 02:57:20.404]  And it's not like we're being invaded by Switzerland.
[02:57:21.784 --> 02:57:24.965]  It's not like we're being invaded by the Romans and they build aqueducts or something.
[02:57:25.748 --> 02:57:32.672]  The globalists are bringing in the lowest level of the third world to collapse us and bragging about it while they're all tax-exempt being jerks!
[02:57:33.912 --> 02:57:38.154]  Please don't forget store-wide free shipping and we've got, what, 50 to 60% off.
[02:57:38.174 --> 02:57:41.016]  It's all going to end in two days on all the great products.

[02:57:43.137 --> 02:57:43.997]  Please commit today.
[02:57:44.278 --> 02:57:44.998]  We're fighting hard.
[02:57:45.038 --> 02:57:45.718]  Get a great product.
[02:57:46.019 --> 02:57:46.639]  Get a t-shirt.
[02:57:46.759 --> 02:57:47.619]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:58.378]  You're north of 281, south of the scales, correct?
[02:58:28.530 --> 02:58:37.456]  Chief Karish did say today that they have reached over 300,000 apprehensions along the southwestern border for this fiscal year alone.
[02:58:37.836 --> 02:58:40.658]  Now, specifically here in the RGV, they have seen over 130,000.
[02:58:40.818 --> 02:58:50.624]  CBP today released that they're expecting to apprehend over 55,000 family units for the month of March alone.
[02:58:51.344 --> 02:58:58.228]  The fact of the matter is this is not an emergency and the president's fear-mongering doesn't make it one.
[02:58:58.588 --> 02:59:00.989]  There is no crisis at the border.
[02:59:01.269 --> 02:59:07.252]  I'll state that this is a manufactured crisis and a crisis that manufactured by the Trump administration.
[02:59:07.453 --> 02:59:17.698]  But he clearly understands in his gut what stirs his base and he is determined to inflame these fears regardless of the facts or the effect this will have on the country.
[02:59:18.098 --> 02:59:21.739]  What's at the core of this crisis is the Trump administration.
[02:59:21.799 --> 02:59:27.621]  The reason that the Democrats refuse to call this a crisis is because they see it as an opportunity.
[02:59:27.661 --> 02:59:33.442]  CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our southwest border.
[02:59:33.462 --> 02:59:39.004]  The Mexican Interior Secretary said that they're planning to see, come through Mexico, the mother of all caravans.
[02:59:39.084 --> 02:59:42.045]  It is very definitely a crisis and the question is what do you do about it?
[02:59:42.065 --> 02:59:43.125]  We will build a wall.
[02:59:43.665 --> 02:59:44.725]  We will build a wall.
[02:59:45.846 --> 02:59:47.326]  We will build a wall.
[02:59:55.177 --> 02:59:59.258]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.779 --> 03:00:01.099]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:16.324 --> 03:00:17.204]  You found it.
[03:00:17.564 --> 03:00:19.125]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:19.585 --> 03:00:21.906]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:45.416 --> 03:00:47.837]  Thomas says he's in law enforcement in Mississippi.
[03:00:47.857 --> 03:00:51.158]  Let's talk about what can be done because I'm not a dramatic person.
[03:00:52.543 --> 03:01:02.727]  And I follow the border news, and I know 3,000 a day is huge in El Paso or McAllen, and both border heads there said it's 13,000 to 15,000 to 16,000 a day.
[03:01:02.747 --> 03:01:05.949]  And we're not testing anybody.
[03:01:05.969 --> 03:01:06.869]  We're not even getting who they are.
[03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:08.770]  They're just going every direction, because you can't.
[03:01:09.390 --> 03:01:11.071]  Well, the Border Patrol ought to do something.
[03:01:12.231 --> 03:01:13.652]  You travel with 20 people to stop 10,000.
[03:01:15.873 --> 03:01:16.733]  It's insane.
[03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:19.114]  What do you think's happening here, Thomas?
[03:01:21.564 --> 03:01:22.684]  Hey Alex, how are you doing, sir?
[03:01:23.745 --> 03:01:25.205]  I've never been this concerned for the country.
[03:01:25.265 --> 03:01:26.325]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:01:26.385 --> 03:01:26.865]  How are you doing?
[03:01:28.186 --> 03:01:34.847]  I'm doing fine, but I'm going to address the elephant in the room that it appears nobody else wants to discuss or talk.
[03:01:35.267 --> 03:01:36.288]  And that's plain and simple.
[03:01:36.668 --> 03:01:37.568]  I'm a Trump supporter.
[03:01:38.068 --> 03:01:38.828]  I voted for him.
[03:01:39.408 --> 03:01:40.789]  But I'm going to put this all on him.
[03:01:40.929 --> 03:01:44.870]  He has got specific laws, specifically 10 U.S.C.
[03:01:44.890 --> 03:01:49.611]  284 that state that this doesn't have to turn into a dog and pony show.
[03:01:49.991 --> 03:01:50.571]  He can act.
[03:01:51.035 --> 03:01:56.536]  So to me it seems like he's agitating sides, or he's saying the left isn't letting me do this boo-hoo.
[03:01:56.956 --> 03:02:02.377]  He has all the authority, not only given through the executive branch, but that specific law I just mentioned.
[03:02:02.877 --> 03:02:03.978]  To me this seems like a game.
[03:02:04.318 --> 03:02:07.458]  Well you're very sophisticated, because this weekend I was thinking about this.
[03:02:07.518 --> 03:02:15.680]  I said, I hope Trump didn't blame the fire, letting this crisis get out of control to win the next election, because we might win that one, but we'll lose all the others after.
[03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:19.361]  And I was thinking that myself, is he letting this get out of control?
[03:02:20.965 --> 03:02:32.194]  It has to be because I actually, Alex, I've sat down the other night and I listed with ongoing events 10 or 12 different subjects where he actually has authority to take control of and he does not.
[03:02:32.474 --> 03:02:35.436]  But he does love to get in front of the camera and say, look at the left that's stopping me.
[03:02:35.756 --> 03:02:37.738]  I'm starting to think maybe he was there to
[03:02:38.376 --> 03:02:39.336]  Cause more division?
[03:02:40.577 --> 03:02:41.057]  I'll be honest.
[03:02:41.257 --> 03:02:44.518]  Under Obama, we knew it was literally... But here's the deal.
[03:02:44.619 --> 03:02:46.579]  He's not a police officer like you.
[03:02:46.599 --> 03:02:47.680]  And I'm not just defending Trump.
[03:02:47.860 --> 03:02:49.581]  I've noticed when he gets info, he does the right thing.
[03:02:49.941 --> 03:02:51.741]  He's there asking his advisors things.
[03:02:54.382 --> 03:02:55.483]  He can ask his advisors.
[03:02:55.543 --> 03:02:56.623]  Well, he needs to get new advisors.
[03:02:56.663 --> 03:02:59.605]  The bottom line is, I'm pretty much a low-level guy.
[03:02:59.645 --> 03:03:05.367]  But if I can look up the laws and see my civics the way that they're put to us, if he can't see them, he doesn't need to be in the job.
[03:03:05.527 --> 03:03:06.727]  Then you've got the next two minutes.
[03:03:09.091 --> 03:03:10.091]  What does Trump need to do?
[03:03:11.492 --> 03:03:12.552]  Trump needs to follow the law.
[03:03:12.732 --> 03:03:13.372]  Plain and simple.
[03:03:13.673 --> 03:03:16.253]  He just needs... 10 U.S.C.
[03:03:16.273 --> 03:03:17.574]  284 gets him full authority.
[03:03:17.934 --> 03:03:23.516]  When he was doing his dog and pony show with Nancy Pelosi, like, asking for funds and all this kind of garbage, that's pure nonsense.
[03:03:23.556 --> 03:03:25.997]  Executive Branch has its own budget.
[03:03:26.377 --> 03:03:30.378]  He could have built the wall with no fanfare, very quietly, and did it.
[03:03:30.638 --> 03:03:36.120]  But he was... It was acting like Aunt Bee and Gomer Pyle need to give him authority, and this person and that person.
[03:03:36.570 --> 03:03:40.591]  His legal authority is clearly spelled out, and it would take a third grader to see it.
[03:03:40.911 --> 03:03:41.611]  No, you're right.
[03:03:42.371 --> 03:03:44.172]  Under the Commander-in-Chief, he could do whatever he wanted.
[03:03:45.772 --> 03:03:58.054]  When it comes to military installations and federal buildings and borders within the United States and or its territories, he has full legal, and to quote the law, sole authority.
[03:03:58.534 --> 03:03:59.595]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:04:01.995 --> 03:04:02.635]  No, you're right.
[03:04:02.995 --> 03:04:04.356]  And that's why Ann Coulter's mad at him.
[03:04:04.396 --> 03:04:05.476]  So what do you think he's really up to?
[03:04:07.352 --> 03:04:10.694]  That's where I lean on you, Alex, because you've been deciphering it for years.
[03:04:11.534 --> 03:04:19.379]  You know, Trump's super smart on some things and not on others, and I'm not trying to give him a pass, but when you finally get to him with something, he'll do the right thing.
[03:04:19.399 --> 03:04:19.999]  That's why they fight.
[03:04:20.399 --> 03:04:21.200]  We can't get to him.
[03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:22.220]  We still do.
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:26.643]  He has these advisors around him that I'm not giving him a pass.
[03:04:28.043 --> 03:04:31.085]  But we need to get to him so that he understands.
[03:04:31.766 --> 03:04:34.108]  Like the way he acted all happy once he got cleared of Russiagate.
[03:04:34.188 --> 03:04:35.208]  Of course he was cleared of it.
[03:04:35.649 --> 03:04:36.529]  Why wait till they do it?
[03:04:37.310 --> 03:04:39.051]  He just... I don't know, man.
[03:04:39.071 --> 03:04:42.753]  At least he cut the funding off to Central America, right?
[03:04:42.833 --> 03:04:43.734]  That was a big move.
[03:04:43.754 --> 03:04:45.876]  I mean, that's a big way to cut it off.
[03:04:46.136 --> 03:04:48.337]  I just... I don't know.
[03:04:48.697 --> 03:04:49.418]  Thank you, Thomas.
[03:04:49.618 --> 03:04:53.281]  We're going to take more calls, obviously, throughout the next few days here.

[03:06:16.783 --> 03:06:18.344]  The United States is under attack.
[03:06:19.045 --> 03:06:21.927]  This is 21st century 6th generation warfare.
[03:06:22.427 --> 03:06:43.764]  The megacorporations of the planet publicly have organized the UN and its World Migrant Refugee Program to actually create refugee crisis and then organize them into political tools to create migration routes out of North Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America into first world nations to politically conquer them.
[03:06:44.585 --> 03:06:51.089]  We're about to break down the facts, the documents, the history and how we can stop it with this critical information.
[03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:53.170]  But it's up to you to get it out.
[03:06:58.473 --> 03:07:10.941]  The story of the 10,000 plus illegal alien migrant caravan that smashed through Mexican defenses yesterday on its way to the United States begins in Europe.
[03:07:12.776 --> 03:07:14.436]  And what they've gone through in the last six years.
[03:07:15.777 --> 03:07:17.937]  But I want everyone watching to understand something.
[03:07:18.857 --> 03:07:27.259]  What I'm about to break down is admitted fact from the United Nations and George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[03:07:28.039 --> 03:07:29.499]  None of this is my opinion.
[03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:41.482]  It's shocking to me to watch mainstream media deceive the American public, but to also watch even conservatives not realize the full magnitude
[03:07:42.318 --> 03:07:45.521]  The United States is under military attack.
[03:07:46.321 --> 03:07:52.526]  It's a 21st century war using weaponized third world populations.
[03:07:53.066 --> 03:07:53.667]  Let's begin.
[03:07:54.407 --> 03:07:59.792]  Now a lot of people think of Europe as far away from the Middle East and far away from Africa.
[03:07:59.872 --> 03:08:02.053]  It's its own area of the world.
[03:08:02.774 --> 03:08:03.775]  The tip top of
[03:08:05.441 --> 03:08:17.219]  industrialization uh... and western civilization the first world but just south of it ninety miles some cases only five months is africa
[03:08:19.451 --> 03:08:26.478]  Now the United Nations, set up by the robber barons about 75 years ago by the multinational corporations, understands that.
[03:08:27.279 --> 03:08:35.207]  It understands that if they have jurisdiction over migrants or over refugees, they can use them as political weapons.
[03:08:35.247 --> 03:08:39.571]  And they've written many a white paper on it, a few of which I'm about to break down here in a moment.
[03:08:40.592 --> 03:08:42.134]  But if you look at the Middle East,
[03:08:43.493 --> 03:08:44.653]  And you look at Central Asia.
[03:08:45.573 --> 03:08:49.294]  It's smack dab right here underneath Europe.
[03:08:49.894 --> 03:08:55.656]  And only Greece and Bulgaria and Macedonia and Albania are standing in the way.
[03:08:56.296 --> 03:09:01.557]  And most of those countries are now Muslim or Muslim majority like Albania.
[03:09:02.557 --> 03:09:04.858]  What did Bill Clinton do back in the 1990s?
[03:09:05.218 --> 03:09:08.979]  Bomb Serbia repeatedly to help Al-Qaeda
[03:09:10.134 --> 03:09:13.116]  And to help other Islamic fighters take control of a third of Serbia.
[03:09:13.516 --> 03:09:18.419]  So it's part of a globalist colonization backing radical Islam across the world.
[03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:39.213]  And in the last six years we've seen more than 15 million illegal aliens staged at UN emergency centers in North Africa and in the Middle East to then be escorted and paid to then invade Europe with socialist and globalist governments under EU control letting them in.
[03:09:40.148 --> 03:09:42.148]  And they admit it's part of a plan to take over.
[03:09:42.168 --> 03:09:44.189]  And I'm going to show you those documents here in a moment.
[03:09:45.489 --> 03:09:48.590]  That's why this is so critical, because they're carrying out the same plan here.
[03:09:50.830 --> 03:09:54.831]  So the story of what's happening to the United States begins in the Middle East and Europe.
[03:09:55.791 --> 03:09:58.912]  Now, here is North America.
[03:09:59.232 --> 03:10:01.952]  From southern Mexico to the North Pole is North America.
[03:10:02.372 --> 03:10:04.773]  Central America, and then South America.
[03:10:05.737 --> 03:10:12.300]  Right now in Guatemala, tens of thousands have already crossed and have been stopped on the edge of Mexico.
[03:10:12.661 --> 03:10:18.003]  Hundreds of thousands more are being prepared in camps in Guatemala and Honduras.
[03:10:18.343 --> 03:10:19.784]  UN-funded camps.
[03:10:19.904 --> 03:10:21.385]  Ford Foundation-funded camps.
[03:10:21.705 --> 03:10:22.886]  George Soros-funded camps.
[03:10:22.946 --> 03:10:24.347]  It's all in federal documents.
[03:10:24.387 --> 03:10:25.047]  It's all public.
[03:10:25.627 --> 03:10:28.769]  But mainstream media will lie and say that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:10:29.554 --> 03:10:33.419]  Now I'm going to break down their overall master plan and then how we stop it here in a moment.
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:38.707]  That's why we're so censored and so blocked because the globalists know we actually research their source documents.
[03:10:39.087 --> 03:10:41.470]  But let's finish up with Europe real quick before we go to America.
[03:10:42.372 --> 03:10:42.792]  Here is...
[03:10:43.914 --> 03:10:44.315]  Reuters.
[03:10:44.755 --> 03:10:47.478]  We have clips of it right here in the Infowars.com article.
[03:10:47.979 --> 03:10:59.191]  Macron walks back mass migration, tells migrants to succeed in Africa after he said 200 million need to enter Europe in the next 20 years or so.
[03:11:00.785 --> 03:11:02.126]  Here's another one from a U.N.
[03:11:02.146 --> 03:11:03.807]  document in 2001.
[03:11:04.047 --> 03:11:04.207]  U.N.
[03:11:05.027 --> 03:11:19.615]  plan to flood America with 600 million migrants to politically divide and conquer, drive down wages, and destroy any sovereignty that nations have in a Tower of Babel type scenario.
[03:11:20.155 --> 03:11:23.177]  Austria, Hungary, and others are pulling out of the U.N.
[03:11:23.537 --> 03:11:24.398]  immigration pact.
[03:11:25.470 --> 03:11:39.805]  Saying that they are not going to be part of this because the UN is purposely paying to bring in the refugees and to create the refugee problem to bring in a client group that the EU, the UN, and the globalists control.
[03:11:41.126 --> 03:11:46.412]  So again, think about how close Africa and the Middle East is to Europe.
[03:11:48.135 --> 03:11:50.557]  It's 90 miles from Italy, only a few miles from Spain.
[03:11:51.237 --> 03:12:00.584]  Soros is on record funding millions of people in Zodiac boats coming across and then invading, being turned into political armies.
[03:12:01.645 --> 03:12:08.230]  The very same thing is now being done, just like it started six years ago in Europe, to the United States.
[03:12:08.770 --> 03:12:11.352]  The good news is we know the battle plan and can stop it.
[03:12:11.452 --> 03:12:16.736]  So the United Nations and multinational corporations that are promoting globalism, almost all of them,
[03:12:17.759 --> 03:12:21.460]  Go in and exploit Venezuela, set up socialism and communism.
[03:12:21.540 --> 03:12:24.041]  Once it collapses, everyone starts fleeing.
[03:12:24.381 --> 03:12:28.443]  And in a domino effect, only seven nations from Venezuela up to the U.S.
[03:12:28.483 --> 03:12:32.564]  border, people begin to flee by the tens of millions.
[03:12:33.124 --> 03:12:34.345]  Just as the U.N.
[03:12:34.405 --> 03:12:42.608]  brings in policies with the IMF and World Bank that collapse North Africa and the Middle East, just like Hillary and Obama started the wars in the Arab Spring that admittedly caused the refugee crisis.
[03:12:43.370 --> 03:12:45.992]  The globalists go in, they help exacerbate the crises.
[03:12:46.612 --> 03:12:48.474]  Millions begin to flee in all directions.
[03:12:48.794 --> 03:12:49.294]  The U.N.
[03:12:49.314 --> 03:12:55.739]  sets up refugee camps to organize, train, and pay the groups to then leapfrog nation by nation.
[03:12:56.039 --> 03:12:56.519]  And the U.N.
[03:12:56.599 --> 03:13:06.806]  openly tells Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, if you simply let our people have passage, we won't leave them here, we're sending them to the U.S.
[03:13:07.387 --> 03:13:11.950]  And now, in just the last year, millions are migrating all the way up
[03:13:13.021 --> 03:13:14.442]  We're good to go.
[03:13:35.089 --> 03:13:38.211]  This is the political plan to capture this nation.
[03:13:38.471 --> 03:13:40.993]  It's been done before, and they admit it's their plan.
[03:13:41.413 --> 03:13:43.695]  Think about the incredible deception of CNN.
[03:13:44.355 --> 03:13:54.601]  When tens of thousands of illegal aliens, UN-funded, smashed over the Guatemalan border yesterday, they said, oh, there was chaos at the migrant march.
[03:13:55.182 --> 03:14:01.246]  No, they attacked the police, they tore down the fences, they rampaged over, and they used children as shields.
[03:14:02.065 --> 03:14:11.393]  And then, when other smaller groups have gotten up to the border, they claim that we're taking children away from these people to find out who they really are.
[03:14:11.413 --> 03:14:15.397]  And in the famous case of Trump standing over a little girl, it wasn't even true.
[03:14:15.737 --> 03:14:21.742]  So they bring these children into this dangerous situation, the UN funds it, and the UN sets up their bases.
[03:14:22.923 --> 03:14:35.429]  Ensuring the next country that we won't let them stay here, give in to us and we promise to ship them into the United States, into Europe, into the heart of the political systems they want to control.
[03:14:36.189 --> 03:14:43.352]  This is the reverse of colonialism and is a corporate form of colonialism using weaponized third world populations to take over the planet.
[03:14:44.335 --> 03:14:50.980]  Now, in part two of this breakdown, we're going to go into the studio and I'm going to lay out how we stop it, how President Trump stops it.
[03:14:51.421 --> 03:14:55.124]  But the first thing we've got to do as modern Paul Reveres is raise the alarm.
[03:14:55.644 --> 03:14:58.687]  We care about third world populations and we hope they reform their nations.
[03:14:59.127 --> 03:15:11.017]  But the very globalists that have imploded their nations are using the crises they've helped create to now literally foment these giant migrant waves to form huge migration routes.
[03:15:13.041 --> 03:15:18.786]  Literal railroads into the West just like they've done Europe.
[03:15:19.487 --> 03:15:21.468]  This is the plan, the official UN plan.
[03:15:21.488 --> 03:15:31.477]  600 million people they plan in the next 30 years to bring into the United States and totally and completely conquer the nation.
[03:15:32.017 --> 03:15:34.879]  Because that's how you control people, is through divide and conquer.
[03:15:35.260 --> 03:15:47.930]  Bring in people, keep them poor, keep them dumb, set them up under socialism, and then if you don't like what the domestic population has done, you can trigger the population you brought in to absolutely burn the nation down.
[03:15:48.571 --> 03:15:53.235]  That's the globalist plan, this is 21st century warfare, and America is under attack.
[03:15:53.695 --> 03:15:55.196]  Now we've got to talk about how we stop it.
[03:16:02.412 --> 03:16:06.275]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:16:07.056 --> 03:16:10.858]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:16:11.299 --> 03:16:18.324]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:16:19.245 --> 03:16:21.466]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:16:22.367 --> 03:16:25.849]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:16:27.170 --> 03:16:30.131]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:16:30.291 --> 03:16:31.851]  We are the power structure.
[03:16:32.351 --> 03:16:33.372]  We are the inventors.
[03:16:33.952 --> 03:16:35.012]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:16:35.732 --> 03:16:38.533]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:16:39.113 --> 03:16:45.095]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:16:46.235 --> 03:16:50.056]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:16:51.090 --> 03:17:00.068]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importstore.com.

[03:17:56.233 --> 03:17:56.373]  Yep!
[03:18:03.479 --> 03:18:04.820]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:06.682]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:18:06.802 --> 03:18:07.222]  It is.
[03:18:07.402 --> 03:18:11.805]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:18:12.286 --> 03:18:13.407]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:18:13.427 --> 03:18:15.368]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:18:15.448 --> 03:18:17.770]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:18:17.930 --> 03:18:19.491]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:18:19.572 --> 03:18:20.953]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:18:21.033 --> 03:18:22.254]  You've got the children's.
[03:18:22.394 --> 03:18:23.354]  You've got the adults.
[03:18:23.495 --> 03:18:24.415]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:18:24.515 --> 03:18:27.878]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:18:27.898 --> 03:18:30.260]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[03:18:30.520 --> 03:18:31.661]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:18:31.821 --> 03:18:32.501]  And I'm just sorry.
[03:18:32.601 --> 03:18:33.601]  You want something like this?
[03:18:33.682 --> 03:18:34.542]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:18:34.642 --> 03:18:36.503]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:18:36.563 --> 03:18:37.103]  It's so good.
[03:18:37.163 --> 03:18:37.703]  In my view.
[03:18:37.783 --> 03:18:39.784]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:18:39.824 --> 03:18:44.447]  When I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:18:46.207 --> 03:18:50.770]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:18:53.737 --> 03:18:59.541]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:18:59.761 --> 03:19:00.482]  I just can't do it!
[03:19:05.222 --> 03:19:07.924]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:19:08.244 --> 03:19:14.149]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:19:14.689 --> 03:19:26.698]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:19:30.161 --> 03:19:33.904]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:41.804]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:19:43.765 --> 03:19:49.709]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:19:50.170 --> 03:19:51.611]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:19:52.191 --> 03:19:55.033]  Perk up with Turbo Force at infowarstore.com.
[03:20:05.706 --> 03:20:11.870]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.956 --> 03:20:23.837]  You found it.
[03:20:24.177 --> 03:20:25.678]  The tip of the spear.
[03:20:26.238 --> 03:20:30.761]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:20:32.628 --> 03:20:37.249]  All right, this is Mike Adams jumping in here for the remainder of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[03:20:37.289 --> 03:20:38.849]  Thanks for continuing with me here.
[03:20:38.869 --> 03:20:45.590]  I've been listening to the show today, as you have as well, and I agree with Alex's assessment.
[03:20:45.650 --> 03:20:54.712]  We are in an emergency situation with the open borders, the invasion of the United States, the occupation and attempted overthrow of America.
[03:20:54.752 --> 03:20:57.192]  But it's really bigger than that.
[03:20:57.552 --> 03:20:58.453]  Alex has talked about this.
[03:20:58.513 --> 03:21:00.733]  It's about the overthrow of Western civilization.
[03:21:01.465 --> 03:21:15.751]  And for the rest of the hour today, I'm going to bring some unique analysis to this situation and explain exactly what's happening and why it's going to get a whole lot worse, a lot worse in the years ahead.
[03:21:15.771 --> 03:21:26.916]  You're going to look back at today and think, these were the good times, because we are headed, Western civilization is headed for an engineered collapse by design.
[03:21:27.879 --> 03:21:35.224]  And it's designed to take down all independent thinking, and even to take down humanity, ultimately.
[03:21:35.305 --> 03:21:39.828]  Because remember, the globalists want to destroy about six billion people.
[03:21:40.668 --> 03:21:44.511]  Now, that is a thousand times bigger than the Holocaust of World War II.
[03:21:45.472 --> 03:21:51.076]  Statistics about World War II typically quote six million Jews being exterminated by the Third Reich.
[03:21:51.716 --> 03:21:54.899]  The globalists today want to exterminate six billion
[03:21:55.928 --> 03:21:56.428]  Humans.
[03:21:56.609 --> 03:21:58.670]  That's a thousand holocausts.
[03:21:59.251 --> 03:22:01.272]  And they are attempting to carry it out right now.
[03:22:02.373 --> 03:22:04.735]  But one of the things is they have to take your guns first.
[03:22:05.376 --> 03:22:11.981]  Because it's really hard to take over and murder people and execute people if people can defend themselves.
[03:22:12.602 --> 03:22:14.483]  So today I have an important alert.
[03:22:14.523 --> 03:22:21.549]  You know, the high-capacity gun magazine ban was overturned in California just a couple of days ago.
[03:22:22.358 --> 03:22:29.662]  Those of you listening in California, you have a very limited window of opportunity to purchase these what I call normal capacity magazines.
[03:22:29.722 --> 03:22:35.505]  To me, a 30-round Magpul magazine in an AR-15 is a normal capacity magazine.
[03:22:36.245 --> 03:22:41.668]  I wouldn't defend my home or my ranch without a 30-round magazine, or several of them, actually.
[03:22:42.268 --> 03:22:43.469]  So that's normal capacity.
[03:22:44.457 --> 03:22:48.161]  You know, to me, maybe a 100-round drum, that might be a high-capacity magazine.
[03:22:48.201 --> 03:23:02.138]  But a 30-round magazine, or for your Glock pistol, or your SIG pistol, whatever you have, Smith & Wesson, you know, a 15-round, 17-round, even a 21-round magazine for your FN 509, whatever you have, that's a normal-capacity magazine.
[03:23:03.018 --> 03:23:10.224]  Retailers are now flooding California with high capacity magazines, as they're called, which I call normal capacity again.
[03:23:10.584 --> 03:23:20.252]  But retailers like Brownells, MidwayUSA, Palmetto State Armory, other online resellers right now, many of them are offering specials.
[03:23:20.992 --> 03:23:25.076]  You know, like nine Magpul mags for your AR-15 for $90.
[03:23:27.347 --> 03:23:45.236]  These are specials because these companies, in my view, they haven't said this, but in my analysis, they are deliberately working to flood California with these normal capacity magazines before the re-ban kicks in, making it illegal for people to purchase or possess these magazines.
[03:23:45.276 --> 03:23:56.942]  And you can bet, you can bet there are probably hundreds of thousands of constitutional patriots, law-abiding citizens across California today that are ordering, you know,
[03:23:57.830 --> 03:24:02.098]  40 or 50 of these magazines, which are, of course, non serialized.
[03:24:02.378 --> 03:24:03.581]  You know, they can't be traced.
[03:24:04.142 --> 03:24:06.486]  You don't need an FFL to purchase the magazines.
[03:24:06.746 --> 03:24:08.410]  And they are squirreling these away.
[03:24:09.111 --> 03:24:10.013]  They are going to hide them.
[03:24:10.796 --> 03:24:12.997]  They're going to hold on to them because they know what's coming.
[03:24:13.357 --> 03:24:24.043]  And what's coming is a brutal civil war, an invasion, almost a military class land invasion of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas through the southern border.
[03:24:24.264 --> 03:24:24.664]  It's on.
[03:24:25.024 --> 03:24:26.285]  The border is beyond broken.
[03:24:26.845 --> 03:24:30.167]  It is, in essence, a war-like invasion of America.
[03:24:31.443 --> 03:24:40.685]  And the fact that many of these immigrants being violent child traffickers and drug smugglers and sex traffickers, not all of them, but many of them are.
[03:24:41.785 --> 03:24:52.588]  And I've got a quote here from Christian Nielsen that I'll talk about today, who even talks about this so-called child recycling traffic ring, which is unbelievably horrific and insane.
[03:24:53.348 --> 03:24:58.989]  The fact that lawmakers in America are trying to disarm the American people
[03:24:59.801 --> 03:25:11.910]  Disarm law-abiding citizens of this country while allowing us to be overrun by a land invasion of violent migrants in some cases, violent criminals and traffickers and smugglers.
[03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:14.292]  This is beyond acceptable.
[03:25:14.812 --> 03:25:18.535]  We are very close to the point in my analysis of
[03:25:19.326 --> 03:25:37.177]  If Trump doesn't activate the American people, if Trump doesn't, you know, maybe call up the militia, or maybe call up the Guard, or maybe call up the Pentagon to defend the border, if Trump doesn't do something, I think we're arriving at a point very soon where the American people are going to do something on their own.
[03:25:37.794 --> 03:25:40.855]  Because, in the Constitution, they have the right to.
[03:25:40.915 --> 03:25:44.737]  You have the right to defend your country against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:25:44.777 --> 03:25:45.917]  And we are being invaded.
[03:25:46.397 --> 03:25:48.418]  This is a matter of national survival.
[03:25:48.798 --> 03:25:50.239]  It's beyond just national security.
[03:25:50.579 --> 03:25:56.701]  This is about whether America will exist over the next, you know, ten years, or maybe less than that.
[03:25:57.041 --> 03:25:58.122]  So, right now,
[03:25:59.409 --> 03:26:09.752]  As it is legal, as this ban in California has been temporarily lifted, if you are in California, get your high-capacity, so-called high-capacity, again, normal-capacity magazines for your firearms.
[03:26:10.092 --> 03:26:24.337]  And the rest of you, all over the country, if you're living in Oregon, you know there's a law they're trying to pass there to ban and outlaw the 80% receivers that you can use to make a fully functional AR receiver in a ghost gunner, a CNC milling machine.
[03:26:25.186 --> 03:26:28.767]  And I have one of those machines, and I mill out my own receivers, and it works great.
[03:26:28.787 --> 03:26:31.628]  You know, Ghost Gunner, it's a breakthrough product.
[03:26:31.648 --> 03:26:32.388]  You should get one.
[03:26:33.228 --> 03:26:33.768]  If it's legal.
[03:26:34.289 --> 03:26:37.510]  But they've outlawed it in New Jersey, and they're trying to outlaw it in Oregon.
[03:26:37.850 --> 03:26:48.113]  Because they don't want the citizens to be armed to defend yourself against this invasion that is being not just tolerated, but endorsed by Democrats.
[03:26:48.513 --> 03:26:49.453]  Endorsed by them.
[03:26:50.413 --> 03:26:52.994]  You know, the level of corruption of these Democrats
[03:26:53.675 --> 03:26:59.376]  Who are, in my analysis, taking money from the drug cartels to keep the border open.
[03:26:59.737 --> 03:27:09.299]  Because the drug cartels need that vector, they need that highway to be able to smuggle in, not just marijuana, because there's no money in smuggling marijuana.
[03:27:09.339 --> 03:27:10.579]  It's legal almost everywhere.
[03:27:11.419 --> 03:27:12.960]  The money is in heroin.
[03:27:13.720 --> 03:27:15.480]  The money is in child trafficking.
[03:27:15.780 --> 03:27:18.241]  The money is in the human smuggling that they're doing.
[03:27:18.261 --> 03:27:21.862]  And what they're doing now is, they're kidnapping children.
[03:27:22.532 --> 03:27:27.525]  So that they can claim to be a family as they claim asylum at the border.
[03:27:28.517 --> 03:27:30.319]  This again is called child recycling.
[03:27:30.619 --> 03:27:38.905]  So they're kidnapping children in Mexico and other South American countries, El Salvador and so on, and then exploiting those children to try to get into America as a family.
[03:27:39.245 --> 03:27:56.258]  And then once the child is released, then the child is taken back down, you know, the kidnapping continues from these coyotes and the human traffickers, and then they assign that same child to another adult to claim that that person is the parent and that's their child.
[03:27:56.878 --> 03:28:00.099]  And this recycling goes on every day.
[03:28:00.579 --> 03:28:02.780]  And this is how Democrats are abusing the system.
[03:28:03.140 --> 03:28:07.342]  If we don't stand up and stop this, I mean, the humanitarian crisis is off the charts here.
[03:28:08.222 --> 03:28:13.464]  We have a humanitarian obligation to halt this, not just a national defense obligation.
[03:28:14.224 --> 03:28:24.208]  If we don't do something urgently, if Trump doesn't take action, or the people don't take action, or the governors of states like Texas don't take action, then America will be gone.
[03:28:25.327 --> 03:28:25.967]  It'll be done for.
[03:28:26.247 --> 03:28:28.108]  America will become Venezuela.
[03:28:28.148 --> 03:28:29.188]  We will be overrun.
[03:28:29.208 --> 03:28:39.170]  And there's no doubt in my mind that civil war will break out because the American people are fed up and they're tired of having their votes overruled by the votes of illegals in places like California.
[03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:46.191]  We can no longer stand by and just watch TV and pretend Trump is going to solve all our problems.
[03:28:46.771 --> 03:28:52.212]  It is time for the American people to demand a solution and be prepared to defend our nation.
[03:28:53.101 --> 03:28:55.102]  Much more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:55.122 --> 03:28:56.003]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:28:56.443 --> 03:28:57.544]  Be right back after this break.
[03:29:16.408 --> 03:29:17.611]  I didn't plug any last hour.
[03:29:17.691 --> 03:29:19.175]  And I've said I'm our own biggest enemy.
[03:29:19.335 --> 03:29:21.380]  But the listeners tend to get it.
[03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:22.784]  They respond when I plug.
[03:29:23.586 --> 03:29:25.430]  But I get so obsessed with news.
[03:29:26.451 --> 03:29:29.233]  The most profitable time to plug is at the very start of a show.
[03:29:29.253 --> 03:29:30.354]  Anybody will tell you that's what it's like.
[03:29:30.714 --> 03:29:34.237]  Coming up, The Andy Griffin Show, with Andy Griffin, brought to you by Jell-O.
[03:29:34.497 --> 03:29:40.021]  They plug up front on those old shows, because I bought a DVD set, and it was the Andy Griffin, like, first season.
[03:29:40.121 --> 03:29:42.222]  I didn't know it was, like, the first season off TV.
[03:29:42.262 --> 03:29:46.285]  It was even kind of low-res, but it was, like, Andy Griffin going, this hour is brought to you by Jell-O.
[03:29:46.445 --> 03:29:50.228]  Here in Mayberry, we like Jell-O cherry flavor, grape flavor, mint flavor.
[03:29:50.268 --> 03:29:52.069]  We put a little bit of this Cool Whip on it.
[03:29:52.249 --> 03:29:52.990]  It's so good.
[03:29:53.190 --> 03:29:55.552]  I'm, like, telling my wife, hey, go to the store and get some Cool Whip.
[03:29:56.152 --> 03:29:58.252]  Get some cherry, whatever.
[03:29:58.532 --> 03:30:05.254]  The point is, is that the most profitable time for us to plug is the first 10 minutes of a show or right up front, this hour brought to you by.
[03:30:05.374 --> 03:30:05.934]  I never do it.
[03:30:06.074 --> 03:30:06.794]  I just can't do it.
[03:30:06.974 --> 03:30:13.195]  I do it at the end because I just get so obsessed with the news and then I can't hire the dozen or so reporters I'm ready to hire.
[03:30:13.415 --> 03:30:20.097]  I can't do all these big things we've got ready on the drawing board because I won't do my job and raise the money.
[03:30:20.277 --> 03:30:21.237]  I'm the problem runner.
[03:30:21.377 --> 03:30:22.277]  Sure, I'm gonna do it right now.
[03:30:22.497 --> 03:30:23.698]  Don't let me be the problem.
[03:30:24.038 --> 03:30:28.439]  We've got supplements, and books, and videos, and t-shirts, and great things you need.
[03:30:28.819 --> 03:30:30.520]  Whatever the best shortwave radio is, we get it.
[03:30:30.900 --> 03:30:32.420]  Whatever the best optics are, we get it.
[03:30:32.921 --> 03:30:34.521]  Whatever the best supplements are, we get it.
[03:30:34.561 --> 03:30:35.961]  Whatever the best t-shirt is, we get it.
[03:30:36.402 --> 03:30:37.202]  And we discount it.
[03:30:37.382 --> 03:30:41.123]  Storewide free shipping, double pay 3 points, 10% off any sign up for auto ship.
[03:30:41.603 --> 03:30:43.604]  50% off all the supplements, but there's a bunch of other deals as well.
[03:30:43.684 --> 03:30:46.364]  But we've got Rain Force, we've got X2, we didn't think we could get any more.
[03:30:46.424 --> 03:30:47.485]  That's actually back in stock.
[03:30:47.505 --> 03:30:48.965]  We've got Colloidal Silver, Silver Bullet.
[03:30:49.025 --> 03:30:51.346]  We've got Happys, natural herbs to make you calm and happy.
[03:30:51.406 --> 03:30:53.026]  We've got the Fish Rolls about to sell out.
[03:30:53.186 --> 03:30:56.047]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:30:56.367 --> 03:30:58.987]  And the PO Box is on there as well.
[03:30:59.027 --> 03:31:00.748]  But thank you all for your support.
[03:31:00.908 --> 03:31:02.428]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:05.149 --> 03:31:07.070]  Just, there's so much freedom still left in the world.
[03:31:07.150 --> 03:31:10.572]  Soros and Hillary and Podesta, they're not in full control.
[03:31:10.732 --> 03:31:12.593]  And, you know, Juncker, he's not in full control.
[03:31:12.613 --> 03:31:14.434]  There's still some America left.
[03:31:14.454 --> 03:31:16.175]  There's still people out there.
[03:31:16.195 --> 03:31:17.856]  And you just keep seeing the guests we have.
[03:31:17.876 --> 03:31:20.297]  And what we do is always in the center of the fight.
[03:31:20.377 --> 03:31:21.477]  Always affecting change.
[03:31:21.518 --> 03:31:22.538]  And always there.
[03:31:22.578 --> 03:31:23.579]  Because we're in the zeitgeist.
[03:31:23.819 --> 03:31:24.659]  We want to be there.
[03:31:24.859 --> 03:31:25.660]  You're there with us.
[03:31:26.520 --> 03:31:28.941]  And when you pray for us, just give us goodwill.
[03:31:29.201 --> 03:31:30.422]  Just think about us and love us.
[03:31:30.622 --> 03:31:31.703]  We're thinking about you and loving you.
[03:31:32.043 --> 03:31:37.465]  And when you buy the products, or you spread the word, or you tell folks about the show word of mouth, it changes the world.
[03:31:37.745 --> 03:31:38.506]  So keep doing it.
[03:31:38.786 --> 03:31:40.507]  From myself and the great crew, we salute you.
[03:32:02.520 --> 03:32:12.505]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com, and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have, and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.
[03:32:12.685 --> 03:32:22.550]  Now, I've got my Knockout right here, and we're going to take it, and we're going to look at the actual results of the Knockout Sleep Formula in real time.
[03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:25.471]  So let me take my Knockout first.
[03:32:26.972 --> 03:32:31.474]  But while we're waiting to see the effects of the Knockout,
[03:32:35.375 --> 03:32:43.380]  I've got some very, very, very important news that I want to get to.
[03:32:44.501 --> 03:32:51.565]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[03:32:51.986 --> 03:32:55.208]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[03:32:55.228 --> 03:32:59.270]  Head on over to InfoWarsLife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[03:32:59.551 --> 03:33:00.891]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:33:06.678 --> 03:33:09.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.007 --> 03:33:19.008]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:19.428 --> 03:33:23.332]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:25.549 --> 03:33:38.094]  Alright, with the Democrats now demanding the full release of the Mueller report and claiming to believe in transparency, of course it's a selective belief on their part, why not release the FISA warrant details?
[03:33:38.214 --> 03:33:49.439]  Why not release the scope memo that expanded the scope of the Mueller investigation way beyond even any hint of a potential crime, but to obstruction?
[03:33:50.099 --> 03:33:53.300]  Why not release Hillary Clinton's 33,000 so-called destroyed emails?
[03:33:56.030 --> 03:33:58.154]  Well, you know, there's a lot of stuff that needs to be released.
[03:33:58.214 --> 03:34:01.299]  Why not release all the Area 51 files for that matter?
[03:34:01.600 --> 03:34:05.767]  I mean, if Trump wants to get into the mood of releasing documents,
[03:34:06.468 --> 03:34:08.349]  Well, there's all kinds of stuff he could release.
[03:34:08.390 --> 03:34:14.474]  I mean, he could blow a hole in the British intelligence MI5 operation, and he may well do that.
[03:34:14.654 --> 03:34:22.320]  I have a feeling Trump is holding things for the right moment to, quote, go nuclear on the intelligence community if it comes to that.
[03:34:22.861 --> 03:34:23.861]  That's just my guess.
[03:34:23.901 --> 03:34:26.103]  I mean, I don't have any specific inside information on that.
[03:34:26.123 --> 03:34:33.509]  But in this segment, I want to present to you an understanding about what's called the collapse of complex societies.
[03:34:34.292 --> 03:34:36.574]  There's a book by that name that I read many years ago.
[03:34:37.154 --> 03:34:38.355]  It's by Joseph Tainter.
[03:34:38.956 --> 03:34:41.878]  It's called Collapse of Complex Societies.
[03:34:42.618 --> 03:34:48.363]  Now, the reason this is relevant to you is because this is what we are witnessing and living through right now.
[03:34:49.504 --> 03:34:53.567]  We are going to suffer an incredible global collapse.
[03:34:53.767 --> 03:34:54.868]  It is now inevitable.
[03:34:54.908 --> 03:34:56.529]  We're past the point of no return.
[03:34:57.149 --> 03:34:58.270]  So have no illusions.
[03:34:58.290 --> 03:35:03.034]  You are going to live through the most difficult time of your life and it's going to get so much worse
[03:35:03.877 --> 03:35:07.238]  Again, you're going to look back at today and think today that these were the good times.
[03:35:08.399 --> 03:35:10.219]  It's going to get more difficult to get anything done.
[03:35:10.920 --> 03:35:12.680]  Logistics are going to break down everywhere.
[03:35:12.740 --> 03:35:17.982]  If you think Boeing airplanes falling out of the sky was a big deal, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:35:18.742 --> 03:35:22.504]  Things stop working when they become incredibly complex.
[03:35:23.331 --> 03:35:24.492]  And I'll explain why here.
[03:35:24.552 --> 03:35:40.178]  But even this morning, the United States Postal Service had an outage of its API for shipping packages, which means that every fulfillment warehouse across the country could not ship out its packages or was delayed while the Postal Service computer bugs were worked out.
[03:35:40.539 --> 03:35:43.080]  It's probably, I mean, I know this affected our operation.
[03:35:43.100 --> 03:35:48.482]  It might have affected InfoWars store operation temporarily, although the API did come back online.
[03:35:49.122 --> 03:35:50.323]  But it just goes to show you that
[03:35:50.928 --> 03:35:56.551]  We now live in such complex societies where, let's take the Boeing example, a pilot of an airplane.
[03:35:56.571 --> 03:35:58.452]  You know, I'm trained as a pilot.
[03:35:58.592 --> 03:35:59.293]  I flew Cessnas.
[03:35:59.613 --> 03:36:03.275]  In a Cessna, you have cables, you know, cable controls.
[03:36:03.355 --> 03:36:04.815]  You are working the foot pedals.
[03:36:04.835 --> 03:36:05.636]  You're working the rudder.
[03:36:05.696 --> 03:36:11.339]  You're, you know, you're pitching the airplane using physical controls in the cockpit.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:14.941]  It's not an electronic interpretation of what you want to do.
[03:36:14.981 --> 03:36:19.002]  There's not some computer software system that's overriding the controls.
[03:36:19.042 --> 03:36:20.823]  Believe me, Cessna airplanes.
[03:36:21.503 --> 03:36:22.924]  I flew a 182, by the way.
[03:36:23.584 --> 03:36:27.505]  Believe me, there's no software in that system at all, except what's on your navigation board.
[03:36:28.085 --> 03:36:29.786]  So you have direct control over that airplane.
[03:36:30.464 --> 03:36:33.526]  And you'd have to be a fool to pitch the nose down and fly into the ground.
[03:36:33.766 --> 03:36:34.867]  I never did that, obviously.
[03:36:36.268 --> 03:36:37.108]  Nobody does that.
[03:36:37.569 --> 03:36:38.589]  You'd be a moron.
[03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:49.297]  But yet, when you introduce complex Boeing software, and now you have to have computer programmers who, by the way, there's no qualification to be a programmer.
[03:36:49.557 --> 03:36:50.557]  Some programmers are great.
[03:36:50.978 --> 03:36:52.359]  Other programmers are morons.
[03:36:52.399 --> 03:36:53.159]  They're incompetent.
[03:36:53.179 --> 03:36:54.340]  They have no idea what they're doing.
[03:36:54.915 --> 03:36:58.757]  There's no certification that guarantees programmers are programmers.
[03:36:58.777 --> 03:37:00.958]  Not like a medical license for being a doctor.
[03:37:00.998 --> 03:37:02.339]  Not that doctors know what they're doing either.
[03:37:02.379 --> 03:37:05.581]  But my point is, anybody can claim to be a programmer.
[03:37:06.641 --> 03:37:07.542]  And they could work for Boeing.
[03:37:07.962 --> 03:37:09.823]  And they can introduce a bug into that software.
[03:37:10.443 --> 03:37:11.804]  They can have oversight.
[03:37:11.944 --> 03:37:15.686]  Oh, we didn't figure that, you know, the sensor would have a glitch or whatever the case may be.
[03:37:16.186 --> 03:37:19.348]  And then you have the pilot at the flight deck.
[03:37:19.918 --> 03:37:32.420]  And that pilot is like, I don't want to pitch the nose down, but the software is pitching the nose down because the pilot doesn't have control over the rudder of the airplane or the ailerons or anything.
[03:37:32.940 --> 03:37:36.481]  The pilot no longer has control over the physical flight surfaces of that airplane.
[03:37:36.801 --> 03:37:42.362]  So the airplane nosedives into the ground, bursts into a flame and makes a giant crater and kills hundreds of people.
[03:37:43.022 --> 03:37:48.423]  This is a very, an eerily accurate metaphor for what's happening across society right now.
[03:37:49.229 --> 03:37:54.373]  Because we have now reached the point of such complexity that nobody is in control anymore.
[03:37:54.753 --> 03:37:56.234]  Nobody is at the controls.
[03:37:56.374 --> 03:37:59.297]  Nobody can get anything done that makes any sense.
[03:37:59.597 --> 03:38:11.026]  For example, if we were a simple society, and we were suffering an invasion of illegal immigrants coming across the border, occupying and invading our nation, the simple decision would be, well of course, build a wall.
[03:38:11.926 --> 03:38:13.127]  Put soldiers on the border.
[03:38:14.088 --> 03:38:15.469]  How hard is that to figure out?
[03:38:16.289 --> 03:38:19.051]  And yet, here we are in America today, a complex society.
[03:38:19.091 --> 03:38:20.092]  We are paralyzed.
[03:38:20.912 --> 03:38:23.394]  We can't get it done even when the President wants to get it done.
[03:38:23.414 --> 03:38:25.275]  We have all this budgeting.
[03:38:25.755 --> 03:38:29.498]  We have all these debates and fake news information sources.
[03:38:30.479 --> 03:38:36.302]  We have, you know, the courts that are trying to interfere with common sense all the time, the liberal court judges.
[03:38:36.903 --> 03:38:39.805]  So we are not at the controls anymore.
[03:38:39.845 --> 03:38:46.009]  We can't just say, hey, build the wall and put people on the border, put soldiers on the border, deploy the military.
[03:38:46.573 --> 03:38:53.539]  For some reason, we are no longer able to do that, in the same way that the pilot of that Boeing airplane is not able to say, stop pitching the nose down.
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:39:01.206]  So we are all on a suicide mission, because we are a complex society that has lost touch with reality.
[03:39:01.506 --> 03:39:05.750]  That's what this book talks about, The Collapse of Complex Societies, by Joseph Tainter.
[03:39:05.770 --> 03:39:11.996]  Now this book looked at over 200 civilizations throughout human history.
[03:39:12.897 --> 03:39:16.878]  The collapse of all these civilizations, it has one thing in common.
[03:39:17.458 --> 03:39:19.358]  They became too complex.
[03:39:19.799 --> 03:39:20.939]  Too much bureaucracy.
[03:39:21.319 --> 03:39:23.259]  Long logistics and supply lines.
[03:39:24.159 --> 03:39:30.441]  Too much centralization taking power out of the hands of the individuals who knew what they were doing.
[03:39:30.941 --> 03:39:37.402]  When farmers don't get to make decisions about what food they wish to grow and the government is telling them what to grow, i.e.
[03:39:37.442 --> 03:39:39.703]  North Korea, you get mass starvation and a food collapse.
[03:39:40.183 --> 03:39:40.323]  Right?
[03:39:41.005 --> 03:39:55.190]  When economic decisions are no longer allowed to be made by small businesses, such as setting their own wages for employees, and instead you have a centralized government that's making all the decisions for you, you have economic collapse, mass unemployment, homelessness, and so on.
[03:39:55.914 --> 03:40:09.239]  When centralization creates, believe it or not, complexity, because now you have to have this incredible bureaucracy to run everything, and you're taking away decisions from the people on the street and people in the businesses.
[03:40:09.699 --> 03:40:14.461]  You know, people, real people, who can make better decisions because they have better information right there.
[03:40:15.041 --> 03:40:17.082]  They're the ones who see what's happening in their communities.
[03:40:17.342 --> 03:40:18.803]  They see what's happening in their businesses.
[03:40:19.143 --> 03:40:21.924]  They see what's happening on the streets or in their local schools.
[03:40:22.624 --> 03:40:27.529]  As centralization happens in societies, you take away all of that control and that autonomy.
[03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:37.899]  You have mass centralization, dictatorial control over education, over economies, banking, finance, technology, medicine, you name it.
[03:40:37.939 --> 03:40:39.060]  That's what Obamacare was.
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:43.324]  It was medicine, a medical dictatorship in essence.
[03:40:43.745 --> 03:40:46.948]  And that's why it failed, because these ideas don't work.
[03:40:48.078 --> 03:40:52.941]  So then, as you centralize things, you create a society that has no redundancy.
[03:40:53.381 --> 03:40:58.944]  You create long, complex supply lines, and the logistics become unsustainable.
[03:40:59.324 --> 03:41:06.969]  And then one little weakness in the system cascades to a system of failures across the entire system, and that's how you get Venezuela.
[03:41:07.529 --> 03:41:11.430]  And socialism is, it is a philosophy of collapse.
[03:41:11.751 --> 03:41:13.631]  It's a philosophy of human suicide.
[03:41:14.211 --> 03:41:16.152]  Socialism and communism.
[03:41:16.452 --> 03:41:20.214]  It always ends in collapse because it must, by definition.
[03:41:20.474 --> 03:41:21.814]  This is what it commands.
[03:41:22.654 --> 03:41:23.855]  It demands that people give up.
[03:41:24.455 --> 03:41:26.977]  ...all of their rights, and all of their individual decisions.
[03:41:27.377 --> 03:41:34.501]  And it creates this highly complex society, multiple layers of bureaucracy, that no one can survive, that can't even deliver food to people.
[03:41:34.901 --> 03:41:41.484]  I mean, Venezuela's sitting on a gold mine of free oil, all you gotta do is pump it out of the ground, and you have endless abundance.
[03:41:42.085 --> 03:41:44.126]  And yet they can't even do that because of socialism.
[03:41:45.157 --> 03:41:47.119]  That's what's happening and it's happening globally.
[03:41:47.439 --> 03:41:56.245]  And when you look at migrant populations now that are fleeing into the United States, they're fleeing El Salvador, they're fleeing Central and South American countries, they're fleeing the Middle East.
[03:41:57.086 --> 03:42:01.409]  Much of what's happening is people fleeing the collapse of complex societies.
[03:42:02.130 --> 03:42:09.115]  And as they are fleeing these collapsing nations, they are causing a cascading collapse throughout the system.
[03:42:09.901 --> 03:42:19.725]  And this is why Western nations like France and the UK and Germany and the United States are now next in line to suffer the cascading collapse.
[03:42:20.205 --> 03:42:23.366]  It is a tidal wave of human incompetence.
[03:42:23.806 --> 03:42:25.807]  It's a tidal wave of government corruption.
[03:42:25.827 --> 03:42:31.649]  A tidal wave of unsustainable complexity in every facet of a society.
[03:42:32.049 --> 03:42:33.130]  The culture will collapse.
[03:42:34.187 --> 03:42:35.628]  The medical systems will collapse.
[03:42:36.188 --> 03:42:37.369]  Economics will collapse.
[03:42:37.949 --> 03:42:44.453]  Science and technology is in the process of beginning to crumble in many ways, as we're seeing, like with Boeing as a good example.
[03:42:45.574 --> 03:42:47.695]  I'm here to tell you, this is only going to accelerate.
[03:42:48.535 --> 03:42:54.279]  After this break, I'm going to try to share with you maybe some things you can do to survive what's coming, because it's going to get bad.
[03:42:54.639 --> 03:42:57.741]  Stay with me here, Mike Adams, on InfoWars.com.
[03:42:57.881 --> 03:42:58.401]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:02.422 --> 03:43:03.082]  It's incredible.
[03:43:03.543 --> 03:43:06.364]  We're fighting back and we're winning thanks to you.
[03:43:06.384 --> 03:43:10.506]  I got some good news for you folks, but some bad news for the globalists.
[03:43:13.027 --> 03:43:16.169]  I've got good news for the people of America and the people of the world.
[03:43:16.949 --> 03:43:22.211]  Trump has been totally exonerated from the entire Russian gate attempted coup d'etat takedown.
[03:43:22.952 --> 03:43:26.954]  And now he's going on the offense with the big executive order of a week ago.
[03:43:28.151 --> 03:43:30.992]  The word is, Apple and Facebook and Twitter, they're all being
[03:43:53.007 --> 03:43:58.709]  Talked to by the President over the telephone, and private meetings are being set up where he's going to lay down the law.
[03:43:59.169 --> 03:44:01.930]  That they're not going to side with authoritarian foreign powers.
[03:44:02.731 --> 03:44:09.513]  That they're going to either abide by the Constitution and Bill of Rights and not be authoritarians, or he's going to take action against them.
[03:44:09.853 --> 03:44:11.854]  That is everything we've needed to hear.
[03:44:12.294 --> 03:44:14.055]  Now let's make sure the President follows through.
[03:44:14.555 --> 03:44:15.956]  Now, InfoWars, as you know,
[03:44:16.716 --> 03:44:19.339]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last few days of the sale.

[03:44:56.248 --> 03:44:57.529]  The same for the First Amendment.
[03:44:58.330 --> 03:45:00.551]  Super Sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:00.831 --> 03:45:01.632]  Only a few days left.
[03:45:03.007 --> 03:45:04.549]  A new habitat has appeared.
[03:45:05.650 --> 03:45:10.135]  Entirely designed and constructed by one species for its own purpose.
[03:45:13.278 --> 03:45:16.922]  These crevices contain the highest density of lizards in the world.
[03:45:18.775 --> 03:45:23.517]  And to early visitors, this new world was already home to First Nations people.
[03:45:23.717 --> 03:45:25.438]  My husband Bruce is now in here.
[03:45:26.238 --> 03:45:27.418]  Um, Roger?
[03:45:28.099 --> 03:45:30.519]  I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees.
[03:45:30.720 --> 03:45:36.342]  A young brain searches for understanding in slow stages, working out what things are and how they work.
[03:45:36.362 --> 03:45:38.302]  Factually and semantically correct.
[03:45:38.322 --> 03:45:40.243]  But no sign of the national emergency.
[03:45:40.303 --> 03:45:43.644]  Out comes a tiny, underdeveloped little worm.
[03:45:43.744 --> 03:45:44.705]  Pretty tranquil down here.
[03:45:45.735 --> 03:45:46.756]  We gotta do what we can.
[03:45:46.916 --> 03:45:47.976]  We always have.
[03:45:48.096 --> 03:45:51.078]  This is a male, and life here suits him well.
[03:45:56.100 --> 03:46:06.606]  This extraordinary creature is half blind, half deaf, and this is just about as fast as it can move.
[03:46:07.186 --> 03:46:12.829]  You might think that this is some kind of circus trick for which he's been specially trained, but not so.
[03:46:13.809 --> 03:46:17.250]  She is doing this entirely on her own initiative.
[03:46:17.270 --> 03:46:19.911]  She's seen others doing it, and she's copying.
[03:46:20.332 --> 03:46:22.432]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[03:46:24.033 --> 03:46:29.615]  I've come too far!
[03:46:29.875 --> 03:46:33.797]  This male has gigantic testes, the largest in the world.
[03:46:33.997 --> 03:46:37.058]  They weigh a ton and produce gallons of sperm.
[03:46:38.601 --> 03:46:46.709]  You know, it is, uh, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:48.210]  Because you'd be in jail.
[03:47:06.088 --> 03:47:08.829]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:20.251 --> 03:47:26.293]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:47:26.953 --> 03:47:28.833]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:47:29.253 --> 03:47:32.074]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.062 --> 03:47:53.593]  So some of the signs that are now rather obvious that the collapse has begun and it is accelerating include the fact that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are actually in Congress when you have a cognitive moron who is making law for the country and you had some voters actually vote for her.
[03:47:54.329 --> 03:47:55.809]  Even though it was just, it was a very small number.
[03:47:56.690 --> 03:48:01.531]  That's a sign that the collapse is here because you no longer have rationality.
[03:48:01.551 --> 03:48:02.831]  You have the collapse of reason.
[03:48:03.211 --> 03:48:04.752]  You have the collapse of education.
[03:48:04.792 --> 03:48:07.332]  I mean, doesn't she even have a master's degree or something?
[03:48:07.852 --> 03:48:14.194]  And yet she talks like a valley girl, high school girl, and she thinks like a six-year-old.
[03:48:14.714 --> 03:48:19.115]  Like a six-year-old walks around and says, oh mommy, I wish no one would ever suffer.
[03:48:19.195 --> 03:48:21.196]  Mommy, I wish everybody would have something to eat.
[03:48:21.716 --> 03:48:26.218]  Mommy, I wish the weather would be nice every day and there would never be flooding and hurricanes.
[03:48:26.658 --> 03:48:30.279]  That's sort of the mindset of people like Ocasio-Cortez.
[03:48:30.539 --> 03:48:34.120]  It is an infantile, idiotic mindset.
[03:48:34.220 --> 03:48:36.041]  Why are these people making laws in our country?
[03:48:36.101 --> 03:48:39.782]  Why is she featured as a speaker everywhere and on the cover of magazines?
[03:48:40.322 --> 03:48:41.362]  It's insane.
[03:48:42.263 --> 03:48:42.863]  When you've got
[03:48:44.534 --> 03:48:44.754]  This is
[03:49:02.665 --> 03:49:11.391]  I don't know if you knew this, but recycling programs all across liberal cities today, they are collecting, you know, all the plastic, and then they're just burning it all.
[03:49:11.671 --> 03:49:13.272]  They're just incinerating the plastic.
[03:49:13.312 --> 03:49:19.176]  So, in many liberal cities across America today, the recycling program is a total joke.
[03:49:19.576 --> 03:49:20.537]  It's complete theater.
[03:49:20.897 --> 03:49:28.342]  They used to sell the plastic to China, which purchased, you know, large amounts, thousands, maybe millions of tons of plastic in bulk.
[03:49:28.622 --> 03:49:30.343]  Well, China stopped purchasing the plastic.
[03:49:30.363 --> 03:49:31.284]  They don't want our trash.
[03:49:31.764 --> 03:49:32.625]  Anymore, apparently.
[03:49:33.125 --> 03:49:39.871]  And so these liberal cities, they still have their citizens, oh, sort out your cans and your plastic bottles and sort everything out.
[03:49:39.911 --> 03:49:40.892]  Be a good citizen.
[03:49:41.212 --> 03:49:42.593]  And then, they just burn it.
[03:49:42.913 --> 03:49:43.974]  They just incinerate it.
[03:49:45.055 --> 03:49:46.236]  Like, near your neighborhood.
[03:49:46.316 --> 03:49:49.018]  So, it's insane.
[03:49:49.038 --> 03:49:55.363]  You might as well just gather up all your plastic and set fire to it in your own backyard, because that's exactly what cities are doing.
[03:49:55.383 --> 03:49:57.865]  I'm not saying you should do that, but that's what cities are doing.
[03:49:59.146 --> 03:50:00.687]  But, it gets even worse.
[03:50:02.057 --> 03:50:05.458]  Again, AOC and people like her, they claim to be in favor of recycling.
[03:50:05.978 --> 03:50:07.799]  Well, what about child recycling?
[03:50:08.699 --> 03:50:10.080]  Sounds like something they would like, right?
[03:50:10.140 --> 03:50:10.840]  Child recycling!
[03:50:10.880 --> 03:50:12.401]  Yeah, you should recycle children!
[03:50:13.101 --> 03:50:16.202]  So this is from DHS Secretary Christian Nielsen.
[03:50:17.102 --> 03:50:25.425]  She was on with Tucker Carlson last night talking about how traffickers across the open border are engaged in child recycling.
[03:50:26.016 --> 03:50:30.039]  And what they do is they kidnap children in Central and South America.
[03:50:30.359 --> 03:50:35.683]  I sort of mentioned this in the last segment, but let me read you a quote from Nielsen here.
[03:50:35.864 --> 03:50:43.069]  She says, quote, We've broken up so-called child recycling rings, if you can believe it, in the last couple of months, which is where smugglers kidnap a child.
[03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:47.332]  They give it to an adult to cross the border, and they present themselves as a family.
[03:50:48.293 --> 03:50:49.134]  And then once they get in,
[03:50:49.915 --> 03:50:58.179]  Because, you know, we can only hold families for 20 days, they send the child back, and then they bring the child back with another family, another fake family, another adult.
[03:50:58.459 --> 03:51:00.160]  So this is called child recycling.
[03:51:00.540 --> 03:51:10.864]  And this is how children are kidnapped and trafficked and abused and used over and over and over again because of the open borders.
[03:51:10.904 --> 03:51:12.305]  And this is what Democrats support.
[03:51:13.025 --> 03:51:13.946]  They love this idea.
[03:51:13.986 --> 03:51:18.708]  They love that they can get more voters in by having children kidnapped.
[03:51:19.571 --> 03:51:26.121]  And then, you know, have fake families demand asylum and be given voting rights in places like California.
[03:51:26.521 --> 03:51:32.890]  And just as a side note, by the way, we should, California should be
[03:51:35.061 --> 03:51:37.265]  Ostracized from the Electoral College.
[03:51:37.865 --> 03:51:45.376]  California electoral votes should not count until they have a voter ID law in place and stop giving illegals the right to vote.
[03:51:45.797 --> 03:51:48.040]  California senators should be barred from the Senate.
[03:51:48.361 --> 03:51:51.165]  California members of Congress should be barred from the House.
[03:51:52.156 --> 03:51:55.499]  California is not following election laws.
[03:51:55.799 --> 03:51:56.960]  Those are not American votes.
[03:51:57.240 --> 03:52:00.043]  Those are illegals voting in California's elections.
[03:52:00.283 --> 03:52:04.186]  They should be barred from participating in our electoral process.
[03:52:04.447 --> 03:52:12.674]  Why should illegals in California, who also, by the way, skew the whole census program, why should they be able to outvote you and me?
[03:52:12.954 --> 03:52:14.315]  We are real American citizens.
[03:52:14.355 --> 03:52:15.236]  We've paid taxes.
[03:52:15.296 --> 03:52:16.837]  We grew up in this culture.
[03:52:16.897 --> 03:52:19.880]  We, you know, we've been Americans our whole lives.
[03:52:20.914 --> 03:52:28.621]  Why should somebody illegal kidnap a child, come in, claim that they're a family, get asylum, get voting rights in California, and then out-vote you?
[03:52:29.442 --> 03:52:30.643]  That makes no sense whatsoever.
[03:52:30.703 --> 03:52:37.810]  So I'm all for saying California, like a forced secession of the electoral process in California.
[03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:43.015]  Just bar all California senators, bar all California electoral votes.
[03:52:43.055 --> 03:52:43.716]  That's what we need to do.
[03:52:45.054 --> 03:52:45.535]  But there you go.
[03:52:45.575 --> 03:52:46.736]  Child recycling rings.
[03:52:46.776 --> 03:52:49.458]  That's happening in America right now.
[03:52:49.579 --> 03:52:52.782]  And that's directly from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
[03:52:53.643 --> 03:52:53.883]  Right.
[03:52:54.403 --> 03:52:55.224]  Other news today.
[03:52:56.365 --> 03:53:04.894]  We've got the USDA has now announced that they're going to stop their cannibal cats experiments where they were having cats eat other cats.
[03:53:05.700 --> 03:53:07.681]  Like kittens, to see what would happen.
[03:53:07.721 --> 03:53:09.121]  This is part of the USDA.
[03:53:09.402 --> 03:53:13.783]  The USDA has long been involved in the mass killing and genocide business.
[03:53:13.803 --> 03:53:21.787]  They used to have a program called Bye Bye Blackbird, where they would kill hundreds of millions of blackbirds all across America by feeding them poison.
[03:53:22.747 --> 03:53:24.728]  And this is what the government does.
[03:53:24.748 --> 03:53:27.149]  The government has long been in the business of genocide.
[03:53:27.805 --> 03:53:34.490]  Killing off whatever they don't like, animal species sometimes, and, you know, pretty soon, most of humanity.
[03:53:34.850 --> 03:53:36.472]  This is what they are doing.
[03:53:36.572 --> 03:53:39.754]  So, they said they're going to stop the experiments on kittens.
[03:53:40.835 --> 03:53:44.077]  Most Americans have no idea that they were running experiments on kittens.
[03:53:44.618 --> 03:53:45.118]  But guess what?
[03:53:45.759 --> 03:53:48.401]  The government's still running experiments on you and your children.
[03:53:49.261 --> 03:53:54.946]  And this is especially true in the LGBT community, where you have the transgender medical experiments on children.
[03:53:55.526 --> 03:53:56.387]  So imagine this.
[03:53:57.279 --> 03:54:09.603]  You have a child that's like nine years old, let's say, and then somehow she's watching TV and she's convinced that she's a he, or the other way around, and she wants to be a transgender.
[03:54:10.083 --> 03:54:20.166]  Well, the drug companies and now the psychologists and even the schools are pushing for the permanent surgical maiming and chemical castration of these children.
[03:54:20.726 --> 03:54:29.175]  And these protocols, and we recently published an article about this on Natural News, I forgot the title, but these protocols are extremely dangerous to children.
[03:54:29.195 --> 03:54:34.260]  They cause heart valve problems, and heart disease, and cardiovascular disorders.
[03:54:34.780 --> 03:54:36.642]  These chemicals are deadly.
[03:54:37.022 --> 03:54:42.388]  Very dangerous chemical castrators, and the surgical procedures are, of course, irreversible.
[03:54:43.038 --> 03:54:56.369]  So, you know, you take a young male child and you convince him that he's a girl, because that's the cool in thing now in our collapsing culture, and then you have him undergo transgender quote reassignment surgery.
[03:54:56.449 --> 03:54:58.551]  Well, it's physically maiming.
[03:54:58.611 --> 03:55:01.973]  It's cutting off the genitals of a young boy.
[03:55:02.914 --> 03:55:17.767]  And dosing him up with, you know, castration chemicals to alter him to conform to an insane, deranged society of left-wing lunatics who are trafficking children and they're sexually molesting children.
[03:55:17.788 --> 03:55:23.753]  They are pedophiles and they are now medically maiming children because that's what fits their narrative.
[03:55:24.313 --> 03:55:27.135]  And there is no better example of the collapse of our society right now.
[03:55:27.395 --> 03:55:29.116]  The collapse of Western culture.
[03:55:29.376 --> 03:55:37.061]  When you have a Teen Vogue magazine out there with videos of young teens saying that binary is BS.
[03:55:37.441 --> 03:55:39.342]  Saying that there's no such thing as a man or a woman.
[03:55:39.983 --> 03:55:47.267]  Saying that you can choose whatever gender you want at any time and then all your physical organs magically become female organs or male organs depending on your mood.
[03:55:47.787 --> 03:55:48.668]  That is insane.
[03:55:49.008 --> 03:55:50.409]  That is a collapse of society.
[03:55:51.150 --> 03:55:56.214]  And that's being pushed aggressively everywhere through every school, every university, every left-wing media outlet.
[03:55:56.495 --> 03:56:01.819]  This is child abuse on a scale that we have never seen before in this society.
[03:56:02.760 --> 03:56:10.827]  And by the way, as another side note, if there's no such thing as a man or a woman, as the left says, then why are they celebrating, like, Women's History Month?
[03:56:11.527 --> 03:56:14.650]  What does it even mean if they say there's no such thing as a woman?
[03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:16.271]  Or if anybody can be a woman?
[03:56:17.052 --> 03:56:18.153]  How does it mean anything?
[03:56:18.723 --> 03:56:22.409]  You know, I mean, it's, again, I honor women for who they are.
[03:56:22.549 --> 03:56:25.494]  Real women, I honor individuals for who they are.
[03:56:26.784 --> 03:56:33.149]  But to say that there's no such thing as a man or a woman and then to selectively celebrate women is a meaningless exercise.
[03:56:33.169 --> 03:56:36.592]  But that's the kind of derangement that the left engages in constantly.
[03:56:36.952 --> 03:56:38.773]  Because all rationality is gone.
[03:56:39.034 --> 03:56:39.774]  They are lunatics.
[03:56:40.174 --> 03:56:48.701]  We're talking about mass mental illness combined with pedophilia, child trafficking, you know, rampant corruption and abuse of the system.
[03:56:48.741 --> 03:56:49.782]  That's what the left has become.
[03:56:50.603 --> 03:56:54.766]  So, I didn't get to everything I wanted to get to in terms of preparing for collapse.
[03:56:55.675 --> 03:56:57.675]  I do have a Sunday show here on InfoWars.
[03:56:57.795 --> 03:56:58.716]  It's called CounterThink.
[03:56:59.116 --> 03:57:00.476]  It airs every Sunday, 6 p.m.
[03:57:00.516 --> 03:57:00.876]  Central.
[03:57:01.356 --> 03:57:04.957]  You can also see other episodes you may have missed at CounterThink.com.
[03:57:05.277 --> 03:57:10.618]  And we'll discuss surviving the coming collapse more at CounterThink.com in those videos as well.
[03:57:11.098 --> 03:57:12.298]  Bottom line is, get ready.
[03:57:12.878 --> 03:57:14.798]  The insanity is only going to accelerate.
[03:57:15.138 --> 03:57:16.719]  The collapse is going to get much worse.
[03:57:17.119 --> 03:57:21.720]  If you're not ready to defend yourself, your family, your community, and your nation, you're going to be steamrolled.
[03:57:21.740 --> 03:57:22.600]  You're going to be overrun.
[03:57:23.360 --> 03:57:24.320]  They're going to take everything.
[03:57:25.020 --> 03:57:26.522]  They won't leave you with anything.
[03:57:26.562 --> 03:57:30.465]  You won't be able to own a business, to have property, to have a savings account, to have a firearm.
[03:57:30.986 --> 03:57:34.109]  You won't even be allowed to live if you're a white male Christian.
[03:57:34.409 --> 03:57:37.652]  They're going to have mass executions and mass genocide all across this country.
[03:57:37.692 --> 03:57:38.293]  That's their plan.
[03:57:39.554 --> 03:57:40.775]  Make no mistake, that's what's coming.
[03:57:41.276 --> 03:57:42.577]  Unless we rise up and stop it.
[03:57:43.718 --> 03:57:44.379]  That's the show today.
[03:57:44.419 --> 03:57:45.059]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:45.099 --> 03:57:46.461]  Mike Adams here, InfoWars.com.
[03:57:54.088 --> 03:57:58.531]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:58.752 --> 03:58:03.455]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:58:04.056 --> 03:58:09.900]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:58:10.320 --> 03:58:22.930]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you have to absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:32.376]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:58:32.397 --> 03:58:34.278]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:58:34.598 --> 03:58:35.759]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:58:35.779 --> 03:58:37.020]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:58:37.220 --> 03:58:38.401]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:58:38.781 --> 03:58:40.102]  Man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:58:40.602 --> 03:58:42.223]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:58:42.544 --> 03:58:44.005]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:58:44.365 --> 03:58:46.967]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:58:47.007 --> 03:58:47.867]  This is insane.
[03:58:48.287 --> 03:58:49.909]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:58:50.149 --> 03:58:52.710]  He said, oh yeah, it's just I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:58:53.151 --> 03:58:56.553]  He says, this is totally free, but he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:58:56.573 --> 03:58:59.735]  And I said, it's the synergy of it, of the cancer.
