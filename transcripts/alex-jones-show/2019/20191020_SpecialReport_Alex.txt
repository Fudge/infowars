[00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:04.628]  He's 35 years old, worth close to $100 billion.
[00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:12.133]  He founded and runs the largest and most powerful internet company in the world with close to 3 billion users.
[00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:22.761]  His name is Mark Zuckerberg, and he's standing on a stage proclaiming his defense of free speech and the First Amendment at Georgetown University.
[00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:29.104]  I'm here today because I believe that we must continue to stand for free expression.
[00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:32.526]  Free speech is for everybody, even the crazies.
[00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.607]  That's the very definition of free speech.
[00:00:35.288 --> 00:00:37.249]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.931]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:49.924]  The most repressive societies have always restricted speech the most, and when people are finally able to speak, they often use their voice to call for change.
[00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:56.254]  And I understand the concerns that people have about how tech platforms have centralized power.
[00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.506]  But even American tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on other people's rights.
[00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:09.735]  Inevitably, some people are going to use their voice to try to organize violence, to try to undermine elections, to hurt others.
[00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.818]  And we have a responsibility to address these risks.
[00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:20.797]  Because when you're serving billions of people, even if a very small percent of them cause harm, that can still be a lot of harm.
[00:01:21.778 --> 00:01:32.221]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones' accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:36.903]  The left, which seeks to crush anything it can't control, applauded the news.
[00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.144]  I believe that we have two responsibilities.
[00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:57.907]  To remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can, and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible, and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary.
[00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:00.029]  And that's what I'm committed to.
[00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:02.713]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:12.021]  Well, Facebook believes it's so dangerous that you can be banned from using the platform, Facebook, just for sharing its content unless you simultaneously denounce it.
[00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:14.589]  Let that penetrate for just one moment.
[00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.750]  Think about it just for a second.
[00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.732]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:23.275]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:27.718]  Which conversations all of us in this country can have about America.
[00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:30.761]  Keep in mind that nobody voted for Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:32.022]  He's 34 years old.
[00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:34.603]  He's completely cut off from reality.
[00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:37.025]  He's worth 72 billion dollars.
[00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:41.168]  And yet he can single-handedly make our First Amendment irrelevant after 250 years.
[00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:51.760]  I know many people disagree with this, but in general, I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.843]  So as a principle, in a democracy, I believe that people should decide what is credible, not tech companies.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.521]  Of course, there are exceptions.
[00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:08.006]  And even for politicians, we're not going to allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm.
[00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:10.027]  And of course, we don't allow voter suppression.
[00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:11.829]  Voting is voice.
[00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.052]  A lot of our political debate takes place on social media platforms.
[00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.695]  So if they clamp down on one side of the debate, why wouldn't that influence an election's outcome?
[00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:28.657]  Democracy depends on the idea that we hold each other's right to express ourselves and be heard above our desire to always get the outcomes that we want.
[00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:31.117]  But it's not really about Alex Jones, is it?
[00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:36.298]  It's about the idea that companies can make it impossible for your voice to be heard.
[00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:38.219]  Is that a precedent we should be comfortable with?
[00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:45.540]  Because while we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree!
[00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.941]  That's what free expression is!
[00:03:49.264 --> 00:03:50.525]  People know what's true.
[00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:51.567]  They can smell it.
[00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:53.549]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.211]  You can't control their minds.
[00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:59.355]  You can only humiliate yourself and undermine your own authority by trying.
[00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:04.842]  Our childish billionaire overlords may be geniuses, they say they are, but they don't understand that.
[00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:08.986]  Someday soon they will learn, and that is a comforting thought at a time like this.
[00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.640]  Why is Zuckerberg telling a lie this transparent?
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:28.965]  Well on the surface he's just repeating what the CEO of YouTube said in late August that they never censor and that YouTube and Google are totally open for everyone to say and do whatever they want as long as it isn't illegal.
[00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:32.948]  Infowars tested that and relaunched a YouTube channel.
[00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:35.850]  It was banned within four hours.
[00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:43.176]  And right out of 1984, the YouTube CEO said, we are for free speech, just not Alex Jones's.
[00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:51.945]  Zuckerberg is simply imitating successful deception tactics deployed by Google and Apple against the Western world.
[00:04:52.525 --> 00:05:00.191]  Big Tech's real agenda is global domination, not just total surveillance of all information, but control of all information.
[00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:09.060]  Using Orwellian alchemy, Zuckerberg transforms himself from an enemy of free speech to its chief guardian.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.822]  He will decide what is speech and what isn't.
[00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:14.182]  He will decide.
[00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:21.045]  And if you violate those rules, the AI is closely watching and will punish you.
[00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:32.184]  Authoritarian nations, authoritarian countries, authoritarian individuals are all in a race for hegemonic information control on this planet.
[00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:40.790]  And Communist China's attempt to flex its muscles by fully controlling Hollywood and the NBA has now caused a massive backlash.
[00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.473]  So Zuckerberg and others want to get out ahead of that so that they don't get connected to it.
[00:05:46.874 --> 00:05:51.577]  And then Congress stays asleep and never does anything while they
[00:05:51.957 --> 00:06:10.787]  Quietly take over the planet and destroy all of our basic liberties and freedoms that are the true protections on civilization and are the systems and societies that created an atmosphere of openness and freedom that allowed institutions like Google Apple and Twitter to grow up
[00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:20.232]  The truth is, big tech has been surveilling us, big tech has been consolidating the economy, big tech has been censoring us for a long time.
[00:06:21.032 --> 00:06:25.094]  And the systems that they've developed are antithetical to free societies.
[00:06:26.134 --> 00:06:28.815]  They know that the people value their basic freedoms.
[00:06:29.495 --> 00:06:33.057]  They know that basic freedoms are what make populist movements strong.
[00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:39.332]  But that basic freedom stands in the way of global corporate dominance.
[00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:47.437]  And the CEOs that captain these systems have combined forces against humanity and believe that they can defeat us.
[00:06:48.198 --> 00:07:00.026]  But if we're simply aware of the facts and speak up and use our consumer power to say no to these institutions, we can take control of these organizations for the betterment of humanity.
[00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:08.897]  But the first step is admitting that this is indeed happening and that these organizations are authoritarian and are dangerous.
[00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:12.281]  The truth is the people have all the power.
[00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:16.947]  That's why these companies are trying to control information and are trying to censor to begin with.
[00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:23.014]  So even though things look dark at times, we are getting into very, very good waters.
[00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:29.261]  Because people understand the fundamentals that are happening and are beginning to awaken.
[00:07:29.862 --> 00:07:32.725]  But this process is going to take time.
[00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.629]  Mark Zuckerberg isn't our enemy.
[00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:43.293]  Mark Zuckerberg is really just a tool of a larger agenda and a system that we need to stand up to.
[00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:49.316]  If we don't, the globalists, the technocrats will not respect us and we won't respect ourselves.
[00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:50.716]  It's our world.
[00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:54.058]  So let's start acting like it belongs to us.
[00:07:54.518 --> 00:07:56.619]  Let's start acting like shareholders.
[00:08:12.896 --> 00:08:13.617]  InfoWars.
[00:08:13.997 --> 00:08:14.857]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:15.618]  Today.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.081]  We are in an information war.
[00:08:23.043 --> 00:08:32.209]  Our objective is to destroy the false narrative by reminding as many people as possible to think for themselves and question everything.
[00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:36.784]  We were effective, and so they tried to destroy us.
[00:08:37.224 --> 00:08:43.047]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers.
[00:08:43.207 --> 00:08:47.669]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:08:48.109 --> 00:08:52.231]  This stuff is not speech, it's incitement, harassment, defamation.
[00:08:52.895 --> 00:08:59.260]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.303]  We survived, but we were wounded.
[00:09:02.803 --> 00:09:13.251]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones' accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:16.594]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:19.857]  Obviously what he spews is hate and it's abhorrent.
[00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:23.530]  We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning back.
[00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:26.953]  We must push through to victory.
[00:09:28.073 --> 00:09:31.476]  And so now more than ever, we need your support.

[00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:45.688]  There is now open talk of repealing the Second Amendment.
[00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:51.423]  The NRA is being designated as a terrorist organization.
[00:09:52.324 --> 00:09:56.907]  People are being arrested for personal opinions they post online.
[00:09:57.887 --> 00:10:01.649]  We will continue to question everything and fight until the end.
[00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.692]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and keep the fight alive.
[00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:09.894]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:11.916]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:13.777]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:15.618]  He's specifically calling you out.
