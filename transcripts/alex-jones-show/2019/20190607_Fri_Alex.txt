[00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:17.032]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.375]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:26.663]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:41.109]  Yeah.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.821]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:51.042]  What is your view of silencers?
[00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:51.622]  I don't like it.
[00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:52.743]  Would you like to see those banned?
[00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:54.463]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:56.924]  I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much.
[00:00:56.964 --> 00:01:01.246]  They did talk about the bump stock and we had it banned and we're looking at that.
[00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:03.306]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:05.767]  I don't love the idea of it.
[00:01:06.087 --> 00:01:07.488]  I don't like the idea of what's happening.
[00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:09.349]  Crazy.
[00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:10.930]  Okay, it's crazy.
[00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.312]  Mark your calendars.
[00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:14.394]  June 6, 2019.
[00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:24.784]  Trump does an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Anti-Gun, in England, and says he's seriously looking at banning suppressors or silencers.
[00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:29.689]  I've got an article right here from the ATF admitting that millions of these have been sold.
[00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.272]  And that almost no crimes have been committed.
[00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:35.234]  But regardless, people commit crimes with automobiles.
[00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:37.096]  They commit crimes with baseball bats.
[00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:43.042]  You don't ban butcher knives, or automobiles, or baseball bats because they were using crimes.
[00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:44.463]  Because criminals used them.
[00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:50.709]  I gave Trump a pass after the Vegas massacre, which turned out to be an Islamic attack they covered up.
[00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.114]  Well, he went after bump stocks because bump stocks are basically worthless and are pieces of crap.
[00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:59.757]  But my listeners said, Jones, you're wrong.
[00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:09.307]  The fact that Trump got political points talking about this means that when there are future events, he will blame the firearm or accessories.
[00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:11.189]  Well, guess what, listeners?
[00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:11.689]  You're right.
[00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.631]  So I'm telling President Trump this.
[00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.357]  The Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:18.099]  There's massive pressure to do it.
[00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.640]  It's not going to stop criminals committing crimes.
[00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:36.012]  And if you're going to blame the 10 million plus silencer and suppressor owners in this country because some wound up guy in a gun-free zone went and attacked his co-workers and had one in his truck, then that's my line of the stand.
[00:02:37.452 --> 00:02:40.794]  President Trump, if you become Hillary Clinton, what's the point of supporting you?
[00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:45.398]  You think you're going to garner support from Piers Morgan and the left by doing things like this?
[00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.700]  All you're going to do is turn your base against you.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.763]  So I'm going to tell you what I told Piers Morgan on CNN.
[00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:54.224]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:55.285]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:56.666]  Mao took the guns.
[00:02:57.086 --> 00:03:01.690]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.011]  Damn it, Trump!
[00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:07.577]  At least you said at the end of the clip, well, you're not inclined to do it.
[00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:09.899]  Okay, but you're giving it lip service.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.267]  Once you ban bump stocks, and that whole fake story of what happened when he knows a fraud, you open the door to blame the tools instead of the psychopaths.
[00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:23.971]  And once you did that, you joined the Deep State and the globalists, who are your mortal enemies?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.783]  Trump, I want to support you, but dammit, you crossed the line on the Second Amendment.
[00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:34.747]  I'm sworn to defend this constitutional republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:38.509]  And you crossed that line, you become an enemy of the republic.
[00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.312]  Trump, you know the right thing to do.
[00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:43.773]  You have been warned.
[00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:47.028]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:03:47.308 --> 00:03:48.329]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.511]  Mao took the guns.
[00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:51.012]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.414]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:57.879]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:02.344]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:03.865]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.007]  Do you understand?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.585]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:16.946]  She says she got the best she could.
[00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:31.474]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:04:31.994 --> 00:04:33.255]  I could not do that.
[00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:35.655]  The votes weren't here.
[00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:48.418]  I want to pay you credit for this because when we spoke in Davos after the Las Vegas mass shooting, I brought up the issue of bump fire stock and why it was legal when it was used to convert legal weapons to illegal ones.
[00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.258]  And you did ban bump fire stock.
[00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:50.678]  I ended it.
[00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:52.259]  I don't think you got enough credit for that.
[00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.780]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooting used silencer.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.020]  What is your view of silencers?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.941]  Would you like to see those banned?
[00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.721]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.860]  It's time.
[00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:08.163]  It's time to start your summer with real power.
[00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.686]  The power that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:05:11.246 --> 00:05:18.312]  We're dropping prices by 50% on all of our best-selling force supplements to help you reach your peak strength.

[00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:06.981]  ...news out of Silicon Valley.
[00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:11.823]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:15.503]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:19.504]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:22.645]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:29.827]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:31.068]  Dangerous.
[00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:31.588]  Dangerous.
[00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:32.689]  Dangerous people.
[00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:33.930]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.071]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:35.131 --> 00:06:37.513]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:40.436]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:06:40.496 --> 00:06:41.496]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:42.077]  Danger.
[00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:43.258]  They call me dangerous.
[00:06:43.358 --> 00:06:44.739]  Danger is my middle name.
[00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.841]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.284]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[00:06:50.404 --> 00:06:55.009]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.611]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:01.276]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:07:01.356 --> 00:07:03.878]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:05.960]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.343]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:07:08.844 --> 00:07:11.106]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:12.287]  I want them shut down.
[00:07:12.347 --> 00:07:13.268]  I want them silenced.
[00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:14.068]  I want them muted.
[00:07:14.128 --> 00:07:15.970]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.491]  I want them shut down!
[00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:18.992]  I want them silenced!
[00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:19.853]  I want them muted!
[00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:23.156]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[00:07:25.034 --> 00:07:42.838]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content, and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:43.658]  Screw your rules.
[00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:47.160]  Your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.821]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:54.343]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:56.964]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[00:07:57.084 --> 00:08:00.745]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:08.008]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:09.289]  You are a bad person.
[00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:10.710]  You should be censored off the internet.
[00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.371]  Bad, yes!
[00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:12.912]  Get out of here, Alex!
[00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:17.596]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:26.543]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[00:08:26.823 --> 00:08:30.887]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:21.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is June 7th, 2019.
[00:09:24.139 --> 00:09:26.484]  I'm your host on this Friday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:30.413]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:35.751]  Well, we have one of the heroes of Benghazi, one of the survivors, John Tig.
[00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:37.413]  That's his nickname.
[00:09:38.114 --> 00:09:42.398]  John Tegan will be in studio with us with a lot of really key information.
[00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:54.230]  He'll also get into the fact that the movie, 13 Hours, is about 60% accurate and, of course, traces back to the criminal activity and the stand-down that was ordered by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.411]  So that is coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:56.451 --> 00:10:04.437]  We'll also be joined by David J. Lin, a preacher who was arrested for preaching the gospel in Canada.
[00:10:04.517 --> 00:10:09.140]  Yes, they're getting rid of free speech everywhere, but Canada is leading the world.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.462]  Only worse is places like North Korea and China.
[00:10:12.803 --> 00:10:13.963]  I'm not kidding.
[00:10:14.043 --> 00:10:15.765]  It's already that bad.
[00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:17.499]  So that's coming up.
[00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:25.064]  Also, Dr. Nick Baggage, always loaded for bear, will be joining us today and co-hosting in the fourth hour.
[00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:25.924]  Okay.
[00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:28.005]  Let me just do this.
[00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:31.648]  I got a lot of news to cover here, obviously.
[00:10:31.828 --> 00:10:33.509]  And the collapse of the border is accelerating.
[00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:34.370]  We're going to get into all that.
[00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.572]  And more dramatic footage of giant caravans just surging over it.
[00:10:40.354 --> 00:10:41.114]  Via flare footage.
[00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.397]  But what about President Trump?
[00:10:46.673 --> 00:11:04.668]  What about President Trump and his statement to Piers Morgan that he doesn't like suppressors or silencers and that he would like to see them banned, but he doesn't know if he's going to do that?
[00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:07.991]  Well, A, it's not really up to the President to try to ban stuff.
[00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:08.792]  It's up to Congress.
[00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:15.655]  B, the President shouldn't be supporting that because suppressors and silencers, I know, are big in movies.
[00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:17.517]  And I understand Trump's from New York.
[00:11:17.537 --> 00:11:18.919]  He's not a big gun guy himself.
[00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:19.980]  His sons are.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.783]  And I know they're totally pro-Second Amendment and have informed their dad before.
[00:11:24.163 --> 00:11:25.104]  They're big hunters as well.
[00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:29.947]  But silencers and suppressors are used in almost no crimes.
[00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:35.690]  You have to go through a further federal background check and pay for a tax stamp to get one.
[00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:37.811]  But they are a dream to shoot.
[00:11:38.272 --> 00:11:41.773]  They make there be less kick on the rifle or handgun, more accurate.
[00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:44.475]  And of course, they're not really silencers.
[00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:50.438]  They're called suppressors because it's not like Hollywood movies where they go, pew, pew, pew, pew.
[00:11:50.598 --> 00:11:54.440]  That's not what silencers or suppressors do.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:12.140]  Really sound like I mean you could have some giant suppressor that could cut sound down to a very low level, but your average suppressor All it does is basically turn it down to something about like About like that and then that way you don't blow your eardrums out does it mess with your neighbors?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.804]  It just makes firearms a lot better, and here's the difference
[00:12:17.176 --> 00:12:20.357]  President Trump came out and said, yeah, bump stocks.
[00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:21.338]  They're pieces of crap.
[00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:22.258]  They don't work.
[00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:24.139]  The gun community doesn't like them.
[00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.440]  There isn't a lobby for them.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.281]  They don't allow for accurate fire, in my view.
[00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:30.042]  There wasn't anybody there to defend them.
[00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:35.124]  And when he first came out and said, yeah, yeah, maybe we'll ban bump stocks, I thought, well, they'll never really do that.
[00:12:36.325 --> 00:12:36.785]  But they did.
[00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:38.466]  And listeners got really mad at me.
[00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:42.868]  They said, you know, you need to be more on Trump for this, because next they're going to come after other things when there's events.
[00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:44.489]  And it sells the idea that
[00:12:45.404 --> 00:12:47.746]  The inanimate object is guilty, not the criminal.
[00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:49.747]  And so you watch Jones.
[00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:53.469]  If Trump thinks he gets political points with this, he might go down the line with other things.
[00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:55.671]  Well, he's done it.
[00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:58.873]  Trump looks at silencing the Second Amendment.
[00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:02.855]  And we're going to play a clip from Piers Morgan where he went over this.
[00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:10.160]  I've shot a very powerful report that we're going to repost to the top of Infowars.com and Newswars.com, which was posted last night.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.401]  I shot it last night.
[00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:20.843]  Up here with the crew, my warning to the President, Alex Jones warns Trump 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:13:21.084 --> 00:13:25.786]  Everyone needs to go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and get this article with the video.
[00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:27.347]  It's a powerful four-minute report.
[00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:29.388]  You need to send it to WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:13:29.428 --> 00:13:31.669]  You need to retweet it at Don Jr.
[00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:36.732]  You need to retweet it at the entire Trump family, at the NRA and everybody else, because here's the deal.
[00:13:37.152 --> 00:13:40.614]  The NRA tacitly supported banning bump stocks.
[00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:46.731]  Again, there's such pieces of junk that instinctively I didn't really defend it.
[00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:51.195]  But it set the precedent for now them to go after really legitimate things.
[00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:54.037]  And by the way, the gun industry has been sued thousands of times.
[00:13:54.537 --> 00:13:57.099]  The gun industry, since Trump got in, is losing money.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:57.960]  Remington and others.
[00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:02.304]  Hundreds of companies have gone bankrupt, including our oldest firearms maker, Remington.
[00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:09.102]  And so it's been suppressors, and everybody already has guns, firearms, going out and getting them.
[00:14:09.422 --> 00:14:30.678]  I have been looking at going ahead and buying some suppressors, and you can store them at places like The Range here in South Austin, and then while your paperwork goes through for a few months, you can go shoot it there at The Range or other facilities where it's kept, and then you get to have your suppressor, and then that way, oh my gosh, if you're out in the woods shooting,
[00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:35.002]  Or wherever you are, it just makes shooting a dream.
[00:14:35.682 --> 00:14:37.804]  Once you shoot suppressed, you just don't want to go back.
[00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:40.667]  And I've been so busy, I haven't gotten suppressors yet.
[00:14:41.627 --> 00:14:51.496]  But one of my friends, Shane Steiner, he's got suppressors for Lapua rifles, and he's got suppressors for .308s, and he's got suppressors for...
[00:14:53.678 --> 00:14:54.839]  We're good to go.
[00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:23.148]  I got really mad yesterday, and I stand by the video I put out that is a warning to Trump, and we're going to re-air it a little bit later in the hour.
[00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:25.290]  If you missed it, I aired it right at the start of the show.
[00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.052]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes, but this is a big deal.
[00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:41.921]  Trump's doing a great job on so many fronts and fighting incredible obstacles, but if he's going to meet with Piers Morgan, and he's going to start saying this, and he's got a history of following through on what he says, we better be concerned.
[00:15:42.301 --> 00:15:43.902]  But it's also Trump better be concerned.
[00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:44.423]  Let me tell you something.
[00:15:45.413 --> 00:15:48.895]  Trump's base will walk on him and he'll lose the 2020 election.
[00:15:48.935 --> 00:15:51.896]  This is absolutely self-sabotage.
[00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:54.358]  And again, Trump has a blind spot.
[00:15:54.558 --> 00:15:55.218]  He's a golfer.
[00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:58.040]  He is not a firearms enthusiast.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.881]  Trump, get with the program.
[00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:02.302]  Listen to your sons.
[00:16:11.499 --> 00:16:15.921]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:18.142]  What is your view of silencers?
[00:16:18.162 --> 00:16:18.702]  I don't like it.
[00:16:18.722 --> 00:16:19.823]  Would you like to see those banned?
[00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:21.564]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[00:16:21.704 --> 00:16:24.045]  I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much.
[00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:28.347]  They did talk about the bump stock and we had it banned and we're looking at that.
[00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:30.428]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[00:16:31.568 --> 00:16:32.869]  I don't love the idea of it.
[00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:34.589]  I don't like the idea of what's happening.
[00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:36.270]  Crazy.
[00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.032]  Okay, it's crazy.
[00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:39.414]  Mark your calendars.
[00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:40.976]  June 6, 2019.
[00:16:42.978 --> 00:16:51.888]  Trump does an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Anti-Gun, in England, and says he's seriously looking at banning suppressors or silencers.
[00:16:52.449 --> 00:16:59.376]  I've got an article right here from the ATF admitting that millions of these have been sold and that almost no crimes have been committed.
[00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:02.359]  But regardless, people commit crimes with automobiles.
[00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:04.200]  They commit crimes with baseball bats.
[00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:10.146]  You don't ban butcher knives or automobiles or baseball bats because they were using crimes.
[00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:11.588]  Because criminals used them.
[00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:17.814]  I gave Trump a pass after the Vegas massacre, which turned out to be an Islamic attack they covered up.
[00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:24.210]  Well, he went after bump stocks because bump stocks are basically worthless and are pieces of crap.
[00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.851]  But my listener said, Jones, you're wrong.
[00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:36.394]  The fact that Trump got political points talking about this means that when there are future events, he will blame the firearm or accessories.
[00:17:37.315 --> 00:17:38.295]  Well, guess what, listeners?
[00:17:38.355 --> 00:17:38.795]  You're right.
[00:17:39.435 --> 00:17:40.716]  So I'm telling President Trump this.
[00:17:41.775 --> 00:17:43.457]  The Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:17:44.057 --> 00:17:45.178]  There's massive pressure to do it.
[00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:47.760]  It's not going to stop criminals committing crimes.
[00:17:48.321 --> 00:18:03.014]  And if you're going to blame the 10 million plus silencer and suppressor owners in this country because some wound up guy in a gun-free zone went and attacked his co-workers and had one in his truck, then that's my line of the sand.
[00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:07.453]  President Trump, if you become Hillary Clinton, what's the point of supporting him?
[00:18:07.934 --> 00:18:12.518]  You think you're going to garner support from Piers Morgan and the left by doing things like this?
[00:18:13.078 --> 00:18:15.781]  All you're going to do is turn your base against you.
[00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:18.703]  So I'm going to tell you what I told Piers Morgan on CNN.
[00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:20.885]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:22.406]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:18:22.987 --> 00:18:23.787]  Mao took the guns.
[00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:28.792]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[00:18:29.452 --> 00:18:30.113]  Damn it, Trump!
[00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:34.677]  At least you said at the end of the clip, well, you're not inclined to do it.
[00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.000]  Okay, but you're giving it lip service.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:46.370]  Once you ban bump stocks, and that whole fake story of what happened when he knows a fraud, you open the door to blame the tools instead of the psychopaths.
[00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:49.574]  And once you did that, you joined the deep state and the globalists.
[00:18:49.854 --> 00:18:51.095]  Who are your mortal enemies?
[00:18:52.096 --> 00:18:53.437]  Trump, I want to support you.
[00:18:53.978 --> 00:18:56.900]  But dammit, you cross the line on the Second Amendment.
[00:18:57.621 --> 00:19:01.844]  I'm sworn to defend this constitutional republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:19:02.245 --> 00:19:05.607]  And you cross that line, you become an enemy of the republic.
[00:19:06.048 --> 00:19:09.431]  Trump, you know the right thing to do.
[00:19:10.271 --> 00:19:10.872]  You have been warned.
[00:19:13.206 --> 00:19:14.127]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:19:14.428 --> 00:19:15.449]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:19:15.749 --> 00:19:16.610]  Mao took the guns.
[00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.312]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:19:18.372 --> 00:19:19.514]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:19:19.714 --> 00:19:24.980]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.445]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:19:29.666 --> 00:19:30.967]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:19:31.187 --> 00:19:32.109]  Do you understand?
[00:19:32.717 --> 00:19:41.702]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[00:19:42.243 --> 00:19:44.064]  She says she got the best she could.
[00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:58.593]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:00.354]  I could not do that.
[00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:02.857]  The votes weren't here.
[00:20:06.521 --> 00:20:09.165]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:40.080]  We've got Steven Crowder demonetized.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.922]  Google's looking at banning him.
[00:21:00.956 --> 00:21:13.360]  Because he quoted the host of Vox, who's been given $250 million by NBC a year, who quotes and calls himself, you know, we're queer, we're here, we're here to stay, all this stuff.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.801]  And he goes, well, self-described queer.
[00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:18.342]  They're like, oh my God, you called me a queer.
[00:21:19.102 --> 00:21:19.782]  You can't do that.
[00:21:19.822 --> 00:21:22.023]  These are public figures, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.912]  So now they're trying to have him banned as well.
[00:21:25.932 --> 00:21:28.094]  This is never going to end.
[00:21:28.274 --> 00:21:34.298]  And I've got one of my constitutional lawyers here for all the globalist attacks they've got going against us right now.
[00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:38.481]  Famous constitutional lawyer, First Amendment lawyer, Norm Pattis.
[00:21:39.782 --> 00:21:48.028]  And I was telling him in my office this morning about how I have a street preacher coming on who was arrested and the Canadian government says for criticizing homosexuality.
[00:21:49.414 --> 00:21:50.434]  He said, well, that's not possible.
[00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:51.855]  Canada has free speech.
[00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:56.115]  People don't even know what's happening in Europe or what's happening in Canada.
[00:21:56.436 --> 00:22:05.698]  Canada is worse than places like Sweden, where they arrest you if you report crime statistics that Muslims have committed.
[00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:16.180]  Now, they just had the head police officer of the Netherlands had to resign for covering up Islamic crimes and Islamic terror.
[00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:17.619]  Well guess what?
[00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:27.181]  YouTube, there's an article on Infowars.com, just came out last night with new rules and they said if you discuss someone's immigration status, that is hate.
[00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:29.142]  So they can call anything they want hate.
[00:22:29.162 --> 00:22:30.322]  They can call mothers milk hate.
[00:22:31.462 --> 00:22:37.603]  And so now, thousands of accounts are being deleted in just the last day of mainline conservatives.
[00:22:38.784 --> 00:22:40.204]  So first they came for me.
[00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:44.785]  First they came for Alex Jones.
[00:22:46.468 --> 00:22:52.631]  Built a straw man, a horrible straw man that I'm not, so people wouldn't defend me.
[00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:55.773]  And then once that domino fell, it was everybody else.
[00:22:55.793 --> 00:22:58.715]  Now I'm going to get more into Trump coming out against
[00:23:00.137 --> 00:23:03.258]  Suppressors, silencers, and just how incredibly dangerous that is.
[00:23:03.298 --> 00:23:07.959]  The idea that if someone uses something in the commission of a crime, that it's going to be banned.
[00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:12.120]  Even though there's hardly any cases of suppressors being used in crimes.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:20.782]  In fact, even in my report to the President that we just aired earlier, I show mainstream news, the FBI admitting, the ATF admitting it's almost never been used in crime.
[00:23:21.142 --> 00:23:24.643]  The supposed shooter in Virginia last week had one in his vehicle.
[00:23:26.653 --> 00:23:28.595]  So if he used a butcher knife, would we ban those?
[00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:32.899]  But this is the psychology of where these individuals are going.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.724]  But I wanted to get to a report about Steven Crowder.
[00:23:38.705 --> 00:23:42.769]  A flashback from June 7th.
[00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.811]  That's amazing.
[00:23:46.392 --> 00:23:46.813]  August 10th, 2018.
[00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.592]  So this was August 10th, 2018.
[00:23:52.852 --> 00:24:03.500]  Here we are, 10 months later, on June 7th, on this Friday edition, and I laid out exactly how the next bannings would take place after I was banned last year.
[00:24:03.821 --> 00:24:04.201]  Here it is.
[00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:13.288]  We're saying, when we get Jones down, we want Steven Crowder, and we want all these other people down.
[00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:17.792]  For Steven Crowder, even with shadow banning, his average video has 2 million views.
[00:24:18.172 --> 00:24:19.133]  Everything he does is a hit.
[00:24:20.037 --> 00:24:21.518]  I go to my kids' school.
[00:24:21.578 --> 00:24:24.398]  I go to mainline high schools with my kids for sporting events.
[00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:26.239]  Do you know Steven Crowder?
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.900]  They know who I am, but they don't.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.181]  You know Paul Watson.
[00:24:31.201 --> 00:24:31.841]  He works for you.
[00:24:32.141 --> 00:24:33.061]  You know Steven Crowder.
[00:24:33.822 --> 00:24:42.805]  So, smart, funny, good-looking guys who are very appealing across the board and promoting America, they want them shut down, period.
[00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:45.105]  And now, it's been announced.
[00:24:45.886 --> 00:24:46.666]  He is the next target.
[00:24:52.185 --> 00:24:54.807]  It's crazy to watch their giant PSYOP.
[00:24:54.827 --> 00:25:04.933]  There's an article I'm gonna get to, what the intelligence community's insurance policy on the president would look like.
[00:25:05.033 --> 00:25:05.893]  It's a Hill article.
[00:25:06.474 --> 00:25:11.437]  And if you read what they're doing to Trump and then think about what they're doing to Infowars, this is the blueprint for everybody.
[00:25:13.998 --> 00:25:17.620]  Julian Assange has been on house arrest, the Ecuadorian embassy for six years.
[00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:19.922]  Tommy Robinson, you know, prison.
[00:25:21.374 --> 00:25:24.177]  They're trying to de-platform me and destroy me and sue me out of existence.
[00:25:24.517 --> 00:25:31.063]  This is what it looks like in 21st century information warfare to retake this country from the globalists and from the chi-comps.
[00:25:31.523 --> 00:25:32.384]  And it's all coming out.
[00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:36.988]  So let's go ahead and get into what's happening.
[00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:44.555]  When they started de-platforming us two weeks ago, I said, as soon as they're successful with us, and I said, and they're going to do it,
[00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:50.624]  They're going to come after everybody else.
[00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:54.705]  Because I was reading what the Democratic Party websites were saying last week.
[00:25:54.945 --> 00:26:02.187]  They were saying, when we get Jones down, we want Steven Crowder, and we want all these other people down.
[00:26:03.187 --> 00:26:06.688]  For Steven Crowder, even with shadowbanning, his average video has 2 million views.
[00:26:07.048 --> 00:26:08.088]  Everything he does is a hit.
[00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:13.310]  I go to my kid's school, I go to mainline high schools with my kids for sporting events.
[00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.110]  Do you know Steven Crowder?
[00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:18.805]  They know who I am, but they don't.
[00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:20.086]  You know Paul Watson.
[00:26:20.106 --> 00:26:20.746]  He works for you.
[00:26:21.067 --> 00:26:21.967]  You know Steven Crowder.
[00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:31.716]  So, smart, funny, good-looking guys who are very appealing across the board and promoting America, they want them shut down, period.
[00:26:32.697 --> 00:26:34.018]  And now, it's been announced.
[00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:35.639]  He is the next target.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.402]  And man, he's really polite, but effective.
[00:26:38.922 --> 00:26:42.726]  And if they're calling him hate, because you can take stuff I say out of context and twist it.
[00:26:44.501 --> 00:26:46.482]  Crowder is very scripted.
[00:26:46.502 --> 00:26:47.242]  I don't mean that in a mean way.
[00:26:47.262 --> 00:26:48.463]  He's a famous actor in his own right.
[00:26:48.483 --> 00:26:49.183]  Famous child actor.
[00:26:49.203 --> 00:26:51.685]  So he's able to then really do a lot of preparation and do what he does.
[00:26:52.425 --> 00:26:55.947]  And it's because he is effective and is getting liberals to walk away is why they want him shut down.
[00:26:55.987 --> 00:26:56.807]  But I'm digressing.
[00:26:56.947 --> 00:26:57.707]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:26:58.008 --> 00:27:00.729]  They wouldn't make such a bold...
[00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:13.595]  Full-throated attack on the First Amendment and absolute racketeering, corporate coordination between $3 trillion of capital.
[00:27:14.555 --> 00:27:21.777]  You take the six companies that have blacklisted me, and they called a blacklist, they're now calling it censorship, unpersoning, putting me into the phantom zone.
[00:27:21.797 --> 00:27:25.198]  $3 trillion is what they're estimating, about $3.1 trillion.
[00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:35.397]  So three plus trillion dollars of companies that have moved to China are muscling in on America and they demonize me first.
[00:27:35.797 --> 00:27:40.940]  I'm the target because Hillary called me dark art, knows we were effective at rebooting Americana.
[00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:43.982]  And they know that we're growing exponentially, so they got scared.
[00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:45.523]  They've already dialed back 93 percent.
[00:27:46.083 --> 00:27:52.907]  All the other conservative and nationalist sites, any type of pro-military group, pro-Trump group, they're all banned.
[00:27:54.588 --> 00:27:55.349]  They're all blocked.
[00:27:57.512 --> 00:27:58.733]  But everybody else is already 93%.
[00:27:59.493 --> 00:28:01.475]  Paul Watson is left alone.
[00:28:01.535 --> 00:28:02.535]  He works with Infowars.
[00:28:03.336 --> 00:28:03.776]  But he's 97%.
[00:28:04.256 --> 00:28:06.538]  Because we have the analytics.
[00:28:07.098 --> 00:28:08.059]  We have the server logs.
[00:28:08.719 --> 00:28:10.500]  When they turn us off, man, they just flip a switch.
[00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:26.350]  So, they wouldn't make a super ultra crazy bold move like this, which is right out of the Soviet Union, right out of Nazi Germany, unless they are planning to go for broke on every front.
[00:28:29.363 --> 00:28:34.044]  Okay, so that is from last August, three days after the big massive ban.
[00:28:34.665 --> 00:28:38.326]  Now they're banning positive mention of my name or our websites.
[00:28:38.506 --> 00:28:46.528]  This is beyond the old Soviet Union, but you can override them by spreading the links to InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:46.888 --> 00:28:48.049]  This is a real fight, though.
[00:28:48.589 --> 00:28:51.750]  We'll be right back with the globalists imploding the border, the latest developments.
[00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:52.450]  Stay with us.
[00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.230]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:11.632]  We have a new super special.
[00:29:11.732 --> 00:29:13.653]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[00:29:14.314 --> 00:29:19.657]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[00:29:19.677 --> 00:29:20.677]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[00:29:20.777 --> 00:29:21.318]  Hope you get it.
[00:29:21.378 --> 00:29:22.138]  Sports broadcast.
[00:29:22.158 --> 00:29:22.599]  Spreads the word.
[00:29:22.639 --> 00:29:23.639]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:23.939]  It's 33% off.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.020]  Because we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.541]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[00:29:29.981 --> 00:29:32.542]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[00:29:32.582 --> 00:29:35.162]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[00:29:35.202 --> 00:29:37.103]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:37.803]  50% off.
[00:29:37.883 --> 00:29:39.183]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[00:29:39.283 --> 00:29:40.563]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[00:29:40.683 --> 00:29:42.944]  Turbo Force, which is just tanning our energy.
[00:29:43.124 --> 00:29:44.844]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[00:29:45.024 --> 00:29:46.845]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[00:29:47.005 --> 00:29:48.705]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[00:29:48.985 --> 00:29:50.288]  All of the Force products.
[00:29:50.448 --> 00:29:51.531]  It's got Force in the name.
[00:29:51.771 --> 00:29:53.455]  It's 50-30% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:53.575 --> 00:29:54.958]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:13.188 --> 00:30:17.454]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:30:17.574 --> 00:30:18.356]  They are technocrats.
[00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:20.739]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:28.230]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:30.592]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:30:30.993 --> 00:30:33.114]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:39.880]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.780]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:42.181]  I work a lot of hours.
[00:30:42.762 --> 00:30:47.746]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:30:48.386 --> 00:30:57.393]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:30:58.354 --> 00:31:04.036]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter you're going to find anywhere.
[00:31:04.156 --> 00:31:07.797]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[00:31:08.057 --> 00:31:11.618]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[00:31:12.258 --> 00:31:13.479]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.501]  This is the next level.
[00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.662]  This is Ultra 12.
[00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:23.908]  Exclusively available at InfoWardsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:27.031]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:27.992]  It tastes great.
[00:31:28.372 --> 00:31:29.694]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[00:31:29.994 --> 00:31:30.674]  It is amazing.
[00:31:30.935 --> 00:31:38.602]  Experience pure Methocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[00:31:39.042 --> 00:31:42.725]  At InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:42.885 --> 00:31:53.833]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're going to find anywhere, and it funds the InfoWar, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[00:31:54.053 --> 00:31:57.456]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:22.227]  We made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[00:32:22.267 --> 00:32:24.568]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:35.907]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with InfoWars.com.
[00:32:36.527 --> 00:32:40.130]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify.
[00:32:40.751 --> 00:32:42.472]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[00:32:43.934 --> 00:32:44.514]  Get your order first.
[00:32:56.033 --> 00:32:57.514]  InfoWars4.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:57.554 --> 00:32:59.496]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:31.211]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:31.692 --> 00:33:40.597]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:34:12.623 --> 00:34:26.897]  Our story of what's happening currently to the United States and our borders starts back in 1993 and a man named Ross Perot.
[00:34:28.238 --> 00:34:31.722]  Do you remember that Texan telling you that, listen,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.981]  About 10 years ago, we got rid of the controls we had with Canada.
[00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:42.463]  Canada got rid of those, and their auto workers were making $45 an hour, and our auto workers were making $18 an hour.
[00:34:42.503 --> 00:34:46.684]  Now, our auto workers' pay went down, and theirs went down.
[00:34:47.465 --> 00:34:56.267]  Now, when you move our jobs to Mexico, where they're paid about a dollar an hour, it's not going to raise our pay.
[00:34:56.307 --> 00:34:59.048]  It's going to lower it for Canada and the United States.
[00:34:59.529 --> 00:35:00.669]  Now, we could play all those clips.
[00:35:01.991 --> 00:35:03.572]  Played them many times, and everybody remembers it.
[00:35:05.013 --> 00:35:16.099]  So in 1993, there were zero autoworkers in Mexico producing vehicles for the United States.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:24.464]  Mexico was so anti-America that there was only a VW plant down there, and Mexico would not buy U.S.
[00:35:25.145 --> 00:35:25.485]  vehicles.
[00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:31.635]  Yes, Mexico hates the United States guts for most of its history, because it's lost a bunch of wars with us.
[00:35:32.435 --> 00:35:33.315]  But I digress.
[00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:43.338]  If you expand on all of that, now you've got Central and South America collapsing, as I told you last year.
[00:35:43.698 --> 00:35:44.559]  The numbers are now in.
[00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:49.180]  Most of the illegal aliens aren't coming from Mexico now, they're coming from Venezuela.
[00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:55.505]  Venezuela, another communist country that has completely collapsed.
[00:35:55.625 --> 00:36:01.810]  So now we have up to a third of the cars sold in this country being made in Mexico.
[00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.713]  And has that helped Mexico?
[00:36:04.753 --> 00:36:11.318]  Has that stopped uneducated people wanting to come up here to have their babies for free and get on welfare and all the rest of it?
[00:36:11.358 --> 00:36:11.539]  No.
[00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:13.760]  In fact, it's made it worse.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.684]  So when Ross Perot talked about the giant sucking sound,
[00:36:18.899 --> 00:36:30.425]  When he talked about what was going to happen with all of that, in 1993, 27, 28 years ago, was he right or was he wrong?
[00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:33.267]  And the answer is, he was right.
[00:36:34.247 --> 00:36:36.648]  Now, we've seen the same playbook of Europe.
[00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:40.630]  There's over 15 million military-age men have come into Europe the last 10 years.
[00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:43.032]  That's a conservative EU number, it's probably much higher.
[00:36:43.911 --> 00:36:50.635]  Almost all the military-age men, upwards of 90%, never got jobs and live on welfare because the government wants them there on welfare.
[00:36:51.235 --> 00:37:05.442]  Thousands of cars are torched every month in Europe, thousands of rapes, stabbings, acid attacks, all of it, importing a group from caveman-level squalor in North Africa and the worst countries in the Middle East.
[00:37:05.802 --> 00:37:10.125]  We're getting the worst percentage off the bottom
[00:37:11.212 --> 00:37:22.778]  Of these already very, very dangerous, out-of-control countries, and they've been taught to hate America, they've been taught by the left on top of it to exploit it, and to exploit Europe, and it is a nightmare scenario.
[00:37:23.758 --> 00:37:26.259]  Now, enter Nancy Pelosi.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.721]  We have a clip of this, if we can cue it up.
[00:37:31.362 --> 00:37:36.884]  Nancy Pelosi says that we just won't be America anymore if we don't just let all these groups in.
[00:37:37.785 --> 00:37:40.366]  America's been the most open country in the world, but if you go back,
[00:37:41.724 --> 00:37:54.671]  If you go back to everything that we've seen unfolding at places like Ellis Island and everywhere else, you got checked, you got quarantined for three months on average.
[00:37:56.016 --> 00:38:06.379]  None of that's being done and now every day there's a new video of 200 Africans, 1,000 Mexicans, 2,000 Venezuelans pouring in en masse.
[00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:11.440]  Go to newswars.com and raise the alarm because the left and the globalists don't want you to see this.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:16.122]  Remember just a few months ago they were saying Trump was making it all up.
[00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:18.042]  Remember that?
[00:38:18.762 --> 00:38:19.843]  Trump was making it up.
[00:38:20.103 --> 00:38:21.423]  There wasn't a border crisis.
[00:38:21.763 --> 00:38:22.764]  There wasn't caravans.
[00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:23.984]  It didn't exist.
[00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:27.799]  Think about that.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.941]  And now they say there is a border crisis, but it's Trump's fault, and we've got to give everything free to these people.
[00:38:36.021 --> 00:38:36.901]  Newswars.com.
[00:38:37.201 --> 00:38:37.701]  Pelosi.
[00:38:38.301 --> 00:38:43.442]  If we close the door to immigrants, we won't be the country we were anymore.
[00:38:43.662 --> 00:38:44.482]  What does that mean?
[00:38:44.962 --> 00:38:53.344]  We're not the country we were because we're not checking people for diseases or crime, and when they do check them, one-third of the children
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.962]  ...are not related genetically in genetic tests and they tell ICE, we've been kidnapped.
[00:39:00.762 --> 00:39:03.303]  I was grabbed out of a town in southern Mexico.
[00:39:03.884 --> 00:39:05.744]  These men are from Venezuela.
[00:39:06.905 --> 00:39:09.386]  But children are the golden ticket.
[00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:15.848]  And under Obama, he would just let aid groups, Democrat groups, come with the buses and disappear the children.
[00:39:16.088 --> 00:39:18.329]  And the Senate report admitted, even the Washington Post admitted,
[00:39:19.292 --> 00:39:25.755]  That many thousands of children were put into sex trafficking as young as four years old!
[00:39:26.795 --> 00:39:33.959]  And the Democrats say MS-13 are all God's children.
[00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:36.120]  If you're a radio listener, you have to understand something.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:42.423]  For TV viewers, they're seeing everything I say put on screen by that crew, who in live time is searching what I say.
[00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:45.688]  The Senate report, the one-third being kidnapped kids.
[00:39:46.209 --> 00:39:48.430]  One-third kidnapped kids?
[00:39:49.111 --> 00:39:51.353]  Five thousand a week they're catching.
[00:39:52.434 --> 00:39:54.315]  God knows how many they're not catching.
[00:39:55.657 --> 00:39:59.240]  Some estimates are for every person they catch, they don't catch two.
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.763]  So three times, double, quadruple, we don't know.
[00:40:04.384 --> 00:40:08.988]  And now it's groups of Africans who are paying smugglers to bring them here.
[00:40:09.268 --> 00:40:09.849]  And the U.N.
[00:40:09.889 --> 00:40:11.170]  is paying to fly them here.
[00:40:12.199 --> 00:40:16.661]  And the Vatican is paying, and George Soros gives them plane tickets, bus tickets.
[00:40:19.282 --> 00:40:24.184]  But if they can't get in a port of entry, they don't have a visa, they just fly into Guatemala.
[00:40:25.605 --> 00:40:37.950]  And then they pay the smugglers, the coyotes, and Soros gives them each, man, woman, and child, $1,000, with no name on it, from Visa and MasterCard.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:49.325]  Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard have announced they're hiring human rights commissions from the Southern Poverty Law Center to watch what you buy and who you support, and that if you buy from the NRA, they may get rid of your credit card.
[00:40:49.385 --> 00:40:49.866]  I'm not kidding.
[00:40:50.146 --> 00:40:54.028]  And LA passed a law that if you are a member of the NRA, you must tell
[00:40:55.322 --> 00:41:02.885]  The government, if you work for the city or are a contractor, and then they say you will be fired and you will lose your contracting job.
[00:41:03.245 --> 00:41:05.226]  This is terrorism!
[00:41:05.787 --> 00:41:08.608]  This is Big Brother on steroids and then some.
[00:41:09.208 --> 00:41:11.129]  And it's all out of control.
[00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:16.051]  And it's all only getting worse by the millisecond.
[00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:21.362]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the corporate world waging war on the people.
[00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:24.446]  And then Pelosi says, we're not America anymore.
[00:41:24.927 --> 00:41:32.077]  If we don't let tens of thousands of people pour in with little kidnapped children, one third of them, not with their parents, little babies.
[00:41:33.178 --> 00:41:37.622]  Marching through the desert with kidnapped children, and then five children have died.
[00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:43.686]  I can't believe it's not higher in the last few months in Border Patrol custody, because they get here with deadly diseases.
[00:41:43.906 --> 00:41:48.050]  Sometimes they die before they even get to the hospital, and then it's AMERICA'S FAULT!
[00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:54.835]  Not the Democrats, not the UN, not Soros, setting it up, staging it, telling the people to come here.
[00:41:55.175 --> 00:41:55.435]  No!
[00:41:56.196 --> 00:41:57.377]  It's AMERICA'S FAULT!
[00:41:57.617 --> 00:41:58.478]  It's YOUR fault!
[00:41:59.879 --> 00:42:02.521]  And yeah, you can say, Trump's better than, uh,
[00:42:03.902 --> 00:42:06.583]  Better than Obama or better than Democrats on this.
[00:42:06.603 --> 00:42:08.884]  Yeah, he's putting tariffs on the Mexicans if they don't do this.
[00:42:09.324 --> 00:42:15.907]  And then even Fox News is like, oh, it's terrible to pay more for tequila and $200 more for a car and 30 cents more for an avocado.
[00:42:20.782 --> 00:42:38.468]  We've been sold out by globalism, we've lost our jobs, we've lost our high pay, we've lost the middle class on this, and then now Trump tries to put pressure on Mexico to not organize the invasion of the country, with the Mexican president admitting it's an invasion, with the head envoy from Mexico saying that they're at war with America!
[00:42:39.565 --> 00:42:47.150]  Well I tell you what then, narco-terrorist state, if you're at war with us with the UN, how about we throw the UN out of the US and cut its damn funding?
[00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.531]  And that's what needs to happen.
[00:42:49.111 --> 00:42:52.313]  The truth is, Trump hadn't even taken the gloves off yet.
[00:42:53.314 --> 00:42:55.155]  And the left's saying he's the one that's a criminal.
[00:42:55.575 --> 00:42:57.556]  We're gonna play all these clips and more straight ahead.
[00:42:57.836 --> 00:43:01.859]  But if you're not pissed, and if you're not spreading the word, something's wrong with you because this is war.
[00:43:20.057 --> 00:43:29.755]  And they've got new sites with women talking about the sexual pleasure of killing that baby and having it scooped out of their womb and the orgasms they have.
[00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.911]  And fetishizing it.
[00:43:31.951 --> 00:43:33.712]  Now, none of that's true.
[00:43:33.932 --> 00:43:34.793]  It's all pure evil.
[00:43:35.093 --> 00:43:36.054]  It's super bad for you.
[00:43:36.094 --> 00:43:36.935]  It hurts like hell.
[00:43:36.975 --> 00:43:37.735]  You're killing a baby.
[00:43:37.836 --> 00:43:39.097]  But this is what they do.
[00:43:39.237 --> 00:43:41.118]  And again, it's this dehumanization.
[00:43:41.198 --> 00:43:45.462]  Can we stop with pretending like abortions don't feel good?
[00:43:45.682 --> 00:43:46.883]  Ugh, you talk about evil.
[00:43:46.983 --> 00:43:49.025]  But this is all just a big lie.
[00:43:49.225 --> 00:43:51.727]  Viewer, unless you're discretion advised, you need to hear this demon talk.
[00:43:51.747 --> 00:43:53.348]  Let me do it the Linda Blair voice.
[00:43:53.568 --> 00:43:56.511]  I come really hard when I get an abortion.
[00:43:57.665 --> 00:44:00.388]  And it's not just because I'm killing a baby.
[00:44:01.008 --> 00:44:07.214]  There's actually nerve centers in the back of the uterus that can't be stimulated through regular intercourse.
[00:44:07.694 --> 00:44:12.178]  The only way to achieve that kind of orgasm is to visit a clinic.
[00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:19.263]  And have my vagina speculated and scooped out like the bottom of a bed in Jerry's pipe.
[00:44:19.403 --> 00:44:21.404]  It's dangerous, but love it already.
[00:44:21.444 --> 00:44:27.447]  Now, if you go back, if you want the demon to translate that for you, it's all about me when I kill that baby.
[00:44:27.527 --> 00:44:29.308]  It's all about my power.
[00:44:29.428 --> 00:44:31.569]  It's all about serving my master.
[00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:35.530]  And of course there's the nice line, feel good so comes a sick fetish.
[00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:38.110]  And so it's like coming out and saying, let's tell him it feels good.
[00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.590]  Yeah.
[00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:43.132]  Don't tell him it doubles your chances of cervical or uterine or ovarian cancer.
[00:44:43.212 --> 00:44:45.352]  Every abortion you have in those organs.
[00:44:45.452 --> 00:44:46.632]  Don't tell him it's true.
[00:44:46.652 --> 00:44:48.153]  Tell him it's fun.
[00:44:48.393 --> 00:44:52.554]  It's fun to climb into a wood chip or two when you're a little boy and flip
[00:44:52.654 --> 00:44:55.457]  The strange woodchippers feel good.
[00:44:55.737 --> 00:44:59.921]  Of course, it's gonna kill ya, but I'm not gonna tell ya that.
[00:45:00.321 --> 00:45:01.162]  I'm a liberal.
[00:45:01.663 --> 00:45:02.724]  I'm here to liberate.
[00:45:03.264 --> 00:45:04.325]  Forget intercourse.
[00:45:04.425 --> 00:45:06.067]  It creates a new human life.
[00:45:06.227 --> 00:45:06.748]  No!
[00:45:07.108 --> 00:45:13.334]  The intercourse we have with doctors and medical instruments and knives chopping up babies.
[00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:15.796]  That's what makes us see the realist.
[00:45:16.497 --> 00:45:18.478]  It's not the woman having the orgasm.
[00:45:18.578 --> 00:45:20.278]  It's the little demon.
[00:45:20.358 --> 00:45:21.159]  Now, what's scarier?
[00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:24.560]  Linda Blair and the head going around in a circle and vomiting up green pea soup?
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.501]  And saying your mother's in hell?
[00:45:26.921 --> 00:45:31.683]  Or you haven't experienced the pleasure of killing your baby?
[00:45:32.803 --> 00:45:35.004]  Oh, it's so liberating as a woman.
[00:45:35.804 --> 00:45:37.605]  Oh, it's the best thing I ever did.
[00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:38.705]  That's how a real demon talks.
[00:45:39.465 --> 00:45:40.486]  Oh, join in with me.
[00:45:40.526 --> 00:45:41.846]  Let's kill more of them.
[00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:43.847]  Did I tell you how much I love Lucifer?
[00:46:02.822 --> 00:46:03.342]  It's time.
[00:46:04.163 --> 00:46:06.705]  It's time to start your summer with real power.
[00:46:07.185 --> 00:46:09.187]  The power that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:46:09.747 --> 00:46:16.833]  We're dropping prices by 50% on all of our best-selling force supplements to help you reach your peak strength.

[00:47:06.134 --> 00:47:08.775]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:33.021 --> 00:47:35.064]  Welcome back, my friends, on this live Friday edition.
[00:47:35.704 --> 00:47:40.851]  I know I say this every broadcast because this isn't your regular broadcast.
[00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:41.832]  We're just trying to be entertaining.
[00:47:42.773 --> 00:47:44.556]  I know you're an amazing activist audience.
[00:47:44.776 --> 00:47:45.497]  You're in the arena.
[00:47:45.517 --> 00:47:46.918]  This is how we defeat the globalists.
[00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:50.062]  I've read their public psychological warfare manuals.
[00:47:50.283 --> 00:47:51.084]  We've published them.
[00:47:51.124 --> 00:47:51.684]  We've put them out.
[00:47:52.930 --> 00:48:00.300]  A lot of this stuff's declassified from the left, out of the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and they've got their embeds in all the different U.S.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.842]  government and European Union agencies.
[00:48:02.482 --> 00:48:03.664]  They want to break up the family.
[00:48:04.105 --> 00:48:05.286]  They want to get rid of free speech.
[00:48:05.326 --> 00:48:06.748]  They want to flood us with Islamists.
[00:48:06.808 --> 00:48:09.592]  You already know all this, and we've got all their own admissions.
[00:48:11.903 --> 00:48:14.925]  But they also want to just overwhelm you where you give up.
[00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.165]  I'm doing the opposite here.
[00:48:16.946 --> 00:48:24.729]  I'm agitating with the reality to get people pissed, to get people off the couch, to realize this is an existential threat, so we don't just give up to it.
[00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:28.511]  Now, I always naturally did that my 25 years on air.
[00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:41.298]  It wasn't probably until 10 years ago I started reading declassified, you know, globalist psychological operations manuals and linking to them and writing articles about them and showing them to you.
[00:48:42.247 --> 00:48:44.847]  But they are literally trying to break your will.
[00:48:45.428 --> 00:48:47.868]  Well, the answer to that is saying, I'm going to fight back.
[00:48:48.588 --> 00:48:52.449]  And the way the body and the brain works is once you start fighting back, you get stronger, they get weaker.
[00:48:53.709 --> 00:49:01.210]  And they know via Trump and via a lot of folks, America is coming back and America is getting its focus again.
[00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:04.491]  That's why I really support the president.
[00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:08.591]  And I've been persecuted a lot for supporting the president, which lets you know that the president overall is good.
[00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.172]  But when he goes on Piers Morgan and lip services,
[00:49:12.045 --> 00:49:18.430]  Banning gun accessories every time there's a new event.
[00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.192]  There's 350 million people in this country.
[00:49:20.212 --> 00:49:21.012]  There's going to be murders.
[00:49:21.032 --> 00:49:21.853]  There's going to be killings.
[00:49:22.233 --> 00:49:23.394]  There's bad people in the world.
[00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:26.096]  And said that he's going to ban suppressors.
[00:49:26.717 --> 00:49:30.600]  Or that he's going to try to ban silencers when they're almost using no crime.
[00:49:33.462 --> 00:49:36.024]  Is an example of how much danger we're in.
[00:49:36.044 --> 00:49:38.826]  Because the Democrats just say repeal the whole Second Amendment now.
[00:49:39.287 --> 00:49:40.288]  Remember they used to deny that.
[00:49:41.206 --> 00:49:44.008]  But let's get back into the border first and I'll get back into the Second Amendment.
[00:49:44.508 --> 00:49:45.449]  Here's Pelosi.
[00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:51.873]  You do have to remember the values that freedom isn't free.
[00:49:52.414 --> 00:49:54.856]  And part of that freedom is who we are as Americans.
[00:49:54.896 --> 00:49:57.818]  And who we are as Americans, no one said it better than Ronald Reagan.
[00:49:58.338 --> 00:50:09.165]  Ronald Reagan had the biggest voice for welcoming people to our country and that we cannot close the door or else we won't be the country that leads the world.
[00:50:10.046 --> 00:50:34.955]  And again, for TV viewers, let's just roll the last few days of giant hordes of Africans, Venezuelans, and others just surging over the border, climbing right over walls, right over fences, collapsing everything, and then being grabbed up by the Democrat-controlled courts and given free welfare, free baby births, free everything, and then one out of nine ever show up to an immigration hearing.
[00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:36.176]  They're just here.
[00:50:37.102 --> 00:50:38.963]  A permanent underclass.
[00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:42.665]  And again, I'm all for immigrants, people coming here, people coming here getting jobs.
[00:50:42.945 --> 00:50:47.908]  I've got people from around the world that work here, you know, who are college interns and things, but, you know, paid interns.
[00:50:48.288 --> 00:50:50.009]  I'm not against people from Mexico or anywhere else.
[00:50:50.209 --> 00:50:57.493]  I'm against total lawlessness and no border and the lawlessness of Mexico and Venezuela and all these other countries coming here.
[00:50:58.174 --> 00:51:00.415]  It's so incredibly dangerous.
[00:51:01.876 --> 00:51:02.356]  But you know what?
[00:51:02.376 --> 00:51:04.017]  Speaking of Trump, I'm going to go to this right now.
[00:51:05.165 --> 00:51:08.046]  Because this is so central, and it deals with everything we're talking about.
[00:51:08.527 --> 00:51:22.994]  Here is my emergency warning to the President about where he's going with this, and how dangerous it is, and how it will destroy the support he has in his base, and he will lose in 2020 if he continues down this path.
[00:51:23.014 --> 00:51:28.197]  So the same warning I gave Piers Morgan, I now have to give the President with what he said to Piers Morgan.
[00:51:28.217 --> 00:51:28.477]  Here it is.
[00:51:31.018 --> 00:51:36.120]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.701]  What is your view of silencers?
[00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:39.362]  Would you like to see those back?
[00:51:39.582 --> 00:51:41.083]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[00:51:41.223 --> 00:51:43.564]  I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much.
[00:51:43.604 --> 00:51:47.886]  They did talk about the bump stock that we had at band and we're looking at that.
[00:51:47.946 --> 00:51:49.947]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[00:51:51.087 --> 00:51:52.388]  I don't love the idea of it.
[00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:54.108]  I don't like the idea of what's happening.
[00:51:55.729 --> 00:51:56.950]  It's crazy, okay?
[00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.551]  It's crazy.
[00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:58.932]  Mark your calendars.
[00:51:59.472 --> 00:52:00.954]  June 6, 2019.
[00:52:01.334 --> 00:52:11.403]  Trump does an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Anti-Gun, in England, and says he's seriously looking at banning suppressors or silencers.
[00:52:11.983 --> 00:52:18.904]  I've got an article right here from the ATF admitting that millions of these have been sold and that almost no crimes have been committed.
[00:52:19.484 --> 00:52:21.865]  But regardless, people commit crimes with automobiles.
[00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.705]  They commit crimes with baseball bats.
[00:52:23.845 --> 00:52:29.666]  You don't ban butcher knives or automobiles or baseball bats because they were using crimes.
[00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:31.067]  Because criminals used them.
[00:52:32.367 --> 00:52:37.308]  I gave Trump a pass after the Vegas massacre, which turned out to be an Islamic attack they covered up.
[00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:43.735]  When he went after bump stocks, because bump stocks are basically worthless and are pieces of crap.
[00:52:44.216 --> 00:52:46.378]  But my listener said, Jones, you're wrong.
[00:52:46.959 --> 00:52:55.928]  The fact that Trump got political points talking about this means that when there are future events, he will blame the firearm or accessories.
[00:52:56.849 --> 00:52:57.810]  Well, guess what, listeners?
[00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:58.330]  You're right.
[00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.252]  So I'm telling President Trump this.
[00:53:01.277 --> 00:53:02.978]  The Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:53:03.559 --> 00:53:04.720]  There's massive pressure to do it.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.281]  It's not going to stop criminals committing crimes.
[00:53:07.842 --> 00:53:22.533]  And if you're going to blame the 10 million plus silencer and suppressor owners in this country because some wound up guy in a gun-free zone went and attacked his co-workers and had one in his truck, then that's my line of the sand.
[00:53:24.073 --> 00:53:27.435]  President Trump, if you become Hillary Clinton, what's the point of supporting it?
[00:53:27.476 --> 00:53:32.019]  You think you're going to garner support from Piers Morgan and the left by doing things like this?
[00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:35.321]  All you're going to do is turn your base against you.
[00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:38.444]  So I'm going to tell you what I told Piers Morgan on CNN.
[00:53:39.404 --> 00:53:40.405]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:53:40.945 --> 00:53:41.926]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:53:42.507 --> 00:53:43.487]  Mao took the guns.
[00:53:43.707 --> 00:53:48.291]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[00:53:48.971 --> 00:53:49.632]  Damn it, Trump!
[00:53:51.397 --> 00:53:54.198]  At least you said at the end of the clip, well, you're not inclined to do it.
[00:53:54.718 --> 00:53:56.519]  Okay, but you're giving it lip service.
[00:53:57.159 --> 00:54:05.881]  Once you ban bump stocks, and that whole fake story of what happened when he knows a fraud, you open the door to blame the tools instead of the psychopaths.
[00:54:06.542 --> 00:54:10.583]  And once you did that, you joined the deep state and the globalists, who are your mortal enemies?
[00:54:11.618 --> 00:54:16.399]  Trump, I want to support you, but dammit, you crossed the line on the Second Amendment.
[00:54:17.139 --> 00:54:21.361]  I'm sworn to defend this constitutional republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:25.122]  And you crossed that line, you become an enemy of the republic.
[00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:28.943]  Trump, you know the right thing to do.
[00:54:29.783 --> 00:54:30.383]  You have been warned.
[00:54:32.725 --> 00:54:33.666]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:54:33.946 --> 00:54:34.968]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:54:35.268 --> 00:54:36.129]  Mao took the guns.
[00:54:36.329 --> 00:54:37.831]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:54:37.851 --> 00:54:39.053]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:54:39.213 --> 00:54:44.499]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:54:44.679 --> 00:54:48.964]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:50.506]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:54:50.706 --> 00:54:51.628]  Do you understand?
[00:54:52.219 --> 00:55:01.224]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[00:55:01.764 --> 00:55:03.585]  She says she got the best she could.
[00:55:04.206 --> 00:55:18.094]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:55:18.614 --> 00:55:19.875]  I could not do that.
[00:55:20.595 --> 00:55:22.337]  The votes weren't here.
[00:55:23.818 --> 00:55:28.683]  But if Trump supports them, well then what's going to happen?
[00:55:30.304 --> 00:55:31.285]  Pretty amazing times.
[00:55:31.305 --> 00:55:36.350]  We're going to go to break and we're going to have our guest in here, one of the survivors of Benghazi.
[00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:37.711]  We've had a studio before.
[00:55:38.877 --> 00:55:39.918]  John Tiggs is going to be here with us.
[00:55:39.958 --> 00:55:40.799]  Tiggs is his nickname.
[00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:45.222]  And we're going to be talking about a whole bunch of different issues and what's unfolding in this country.
[00:55:45.242 --> 00:55:50.827]  Then we have a pastor joining us from Canada who was arrested for his free speech.
[00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:54.350]  It is now happening.
[00:55:54.370 --> 00:56:00.135]  The European hate laws are here and we've got to stand up and say no.
[00:56:01.836 --> 00:56:03.517]  Please remember, we are listeners supported.
[00:56:04.502 --> 00:56:06.743]  And without you, we will not be on the air.
[00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:07.263]  Period.
[00:56:08.104 --> 00:56:10.825]  We have the new Space Force shirt, America's Back.
[00:56:10.885 --> 00:56:11.946]  People love the design.
[00:56:12.506 --> 00:56:13.427]  It's already a bestseller.

[00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:52.817]  I think it's official.
[00:59:55.639 --> 01:00:01.583]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.286 --> 01:00:11.131]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:00:20.072 --> 01:00:24.373]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:33.576]  If you think gun control or something like that is going to change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[01:00:34.376 --> 01:00:37.177]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do.
[01:00:37.197 --> 01:00:39.758]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do.
[01:00:39.838 --> 01:00:41.659]  And that's going to worry you a lot more.
[01:00:41.999 --> 01:00:45.160]  Lawdog, if you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.321]  You die first, get it?
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.926]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe.
[01:00:52.946 --> 01:00:53.708]  You understand me?
[01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.371]  He's bluffing.
[01:00:55.411 --> 01:00:55.972]  Let's rush him.
[01:00:56.092 --> 01:00:56.172]  No!
[01:00:57.799 --> 01:01:00.082]  You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[01:01:00.642 --> 01:01:04.526]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[01:01:04.987 --> 01:01:09.652]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[01:01:09.752 --> 01:01:15.498]  We all know that right now, guns is a code, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.019]  It makes them feel good because they're being shot.
[01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:18.641]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:19.922]  There's a big difference between Fantasyland
[01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:23.034]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[01:01:23.094 --> 01:01:25.935]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[01:01:26.196 --> 01:01:27.556]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[01:01:27.676 --> 01:01:34.740]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:42.784]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever
[01:01:43.504 --> 01:01:45.466]  Hasn't had to, um, fight its own people.
[01:01:45.526 --> 01:01:48.069]  And its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[01:01:48.129 --> 01:01:49.190]  So what are you gonna do?
[01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:49.611]  Outlaw everything?
[01:01:49.931 --> 01:01:50.652]  That ain't the answer.
[01:01:50.912 --> 01:01:52.554]  Just put some controls.
[01:01:53.395 --> 01:01:54.396]  Put some controls?
[01:01:54.676 --> 01:01:54.836]  What?
[01:01:55.016 --> 01:01:58.861]  So the people, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[01:01:59.201 --> 01:02:00.382]  No, not so you can't.
[01:02:00.422 --> 01:02:02.084]  Just so the idiots can't get home.
[01:02:02.164 --> 01:02:03.786]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:05.308]  Are you serious about that?
[01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:06.708]  Are you serious?
[01:02:07.148 --> 01:02:07.289]  What?
[01:02:07.429 --> 01:02:08.189]  Good will that?
[01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.289]  Oh my God.
[01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:12.170]  We had our Civil War.
[01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:20.833]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their way of living.
[01:02:21.653 --> 01:02:23.514]  So I agree with that.
[01:02:23.594 --> 01:02:27.115]  I think that's an important part of our existence and it's basically that simple.
[01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:35.426]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:02:37.486 --> 01:02:38.427]  And that's saying something.
[01:02:38.507 --> 01:02:40.988]  John Teagan is in studio for the second time with us.
[01:02:41.008 --> 01:02:43.710]  Goes by Teag and John Teagan dot com.
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:47.772]  John J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-E-A-N dot com on Twitter.
[01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:49.073]  John Teagan.
[01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.474]  Good to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:02:50.554 --> 01:02:51.235]  Hey, thanks for having me again.
[01:02:51.255 --> 01:02:52.615]  You're doing the Lord's work as usual.
[01:02:52.655 --> 01:02:54.937]  You're raising money for veterans and others.
[01:02:54.957 --> 01:02:56.358]  We'll tell folks about that in the next segment.
[01:02:56.498 --> 01:03:00.600]  You've got an amazing Tommy gun that you're going to show TV viewers and that you're going to be auctioning off.
[01:03:01.641 --> 01:03:02.562]  We were just now talking.
[01:03:02.582 --> 01:03:08.985]  What do you think about President Trump with Piers Morgan saying, yeah, we may have to try to ban suppressors?
[01:03:09.846 --> 01:03:11.427]  Again, you're taking away a tool.
[01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:14.709]  You're not going to fix the problem at all because the problem is people.
[01:03:14.769 --> 01:03:17.731]  I mean, the tool that they use to kill people is...
[01:03:19.259 --> 01:03:19.960]  It can be anything.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.462]  You know, you start banning, let's say you ban every gun in the world, next thing you know you're going to have more Oklahoma City bombings.
[01:03:25.562 --> 01:03:28.924]  You're going to have, you know, suicide bombers more than guns.
[01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:30.505]  Yeah, the Islamists just keep using vehicles.
[01:03:30.525 --> 01:03:31.625]  We're going to ban cars?
[01:03:31.885 --> 01:03:34.607]  I mean, people, if they want it, they're going to find a way to do it.
[01:03:34.807 --> 01:03:38.368]  Just banning guns and accessories is not going to solve the problem.
[01:03:38.388 --> 01:03:39.589]  You know, Trump's pretty smart.
[01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:43.511]  He's got to know trying to appease the Democrats is never going to make them happy.
[01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:45.272]  So I wonder why he'd make a statement like that.
[01:03:46.336 --> 01:03:49.137]  Maybe he just wants one agreement with CNN.
[01:03:49.197 --> 01:03:50.297]  I guess, I mean, I don't know.
[01:03:50.317 --> 01:03:51.177]  I don't know why he would.
[01:03:51.277 --> 01:03:55.098]  I mean, again, a suppressor is not quiet.
[01:03:55.378 --> 01:03:58.438]  You're still going to hear a gun go off in the other room.
[01:03:58.478 --> 01:04:00.359]  It doesn't make it totally silent.
[01:04:01.019 --> 01:04:13.841]  That's the crazy part about this, is that Trump's, I think, doing a really good job on so many fronts, but then something like this with the Second Amendment, he already banned bump stocks, and then now if somebody commits a crime with a
[01:04:14.872 --> 01:04:16.313]  With a suppressor, we're going to ban those.
[01:04:16.654 --> 01:04:18.215]  It's beyond a slippery slope.
[01:04:19.416 --> 01:04:24.220]  What, is he going to keep banning everything that a crime is committed with?
[01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:28.784]  Eventually, you've got to come back to a situation where it's society, not the tools.
[01:04:29.144 --> 01:04:30.726]  Exactly, but England's doing that.
[01:04:31.506 --> 01:04:33.928]  Some of their jurisdictions are actually making it a license to get a butcher knife.
[01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:36.411]  They're going in houses and confiscating people's items.
[01:04:37.202 --> 01:04:37.842]  I'm not joking.
[01:04:38.203 --> 01:04:38.883]  That is crazy.
[01:04:39.203 --> 01:04:40.684]  I know this sounds like BS.
[01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:42.085]  Alright, John, let's go.
[01:04:42.105 --> 01:04:42.925]  No, I believe it.
[01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.226]  We're going to come back in one minute.
[01:04:44.266 --> 01:04:56.373]  We're going to get into this event you've got coming up, other events, and then we're going to talk about the fact that I've seen you quoted as saying only about 60% of what you see in 13 hours is actually accurate.
[01:04:56.714 --> 01:04:59.935]  So we'll talk about Benghazi, the rest of the story, that exposes Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:00.436]  That's critical.
[01:05:10.805 --> 01:05:12.446]  We have a new super special.
[01:05:12.546 --> 01:05:14.468]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:20.572]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[01:05:20.592 --> 01:05:21.493]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[01:05:21.593 --> 01:05:22.113]  Hope you get it.
[01:05:22.193 --> 01:05:22.954]  Supports the broadcast.
[01:05:22.974 --> 01:05:23.514]  Spreads the word.
[01:05:23.534 --> 01:05:24.455]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:05:24.555 --> 01:05:24.735]  It's 33% off.
[01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:27.817]  Because we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[01:05:28.017 --> 01:05:30.339]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[01:05:30.799 --> 01:05:33.340]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.982]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[01:05:36.022 --> 01:05:37.363]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[01:05:37.403 --> 01:05:38.604]  50% off.
[01:05:38.704 --> 01:05:40.004]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:41.385]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:45.668]  Turbo Force, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[01:05:45.848 --> 01:05:47.669]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:49.510]  It's 33% off because we're about to sell out of that.
[01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:51.111]  All of the Force products.
[01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.371]  It's got Force in the name.
[01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:54.312]  It's 50 to 30% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:54.392 --> 01:05:55.753]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:26.002 --> 01:06:30.527]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:30.547 --> 01:06:31.708]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.748 --> 01:06:35.311]  All right, we've got a lot to cover while he's in studio with us.
[01:06:35.331 --> 01:06:36.533]  He's been in studio with us before.
[01:06:37.013 --> 01:06:39.295]  John Teague is his nickname, Teague.
[01:06:40.136 --> 01:06:44.921]  John Teagan is his full name, one of the survivors of the Benghazi stand down.
[01:06:45.782 --> 01:06:49.325]  And he's on about a bunch of issues today, but I said, what do you want to hit first?
[01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:59.374]  And he said, I want to get into what really happened in Benghazi and the fact that, you know, look, only about 60% of what's in that movie, 13 hours, is actually accurate.
[01:06:59.435 --> 01:07:13.467]  It's even worse than that, because Hillary's running around saying Trump's a traitor, he needs to be arrested, he's obstructed, he's done all these bad things, but she's the one from Benghazi to the servers, to all of it, and then she's still crawling around, though, acting like she's this great person.
[01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:14.168]  What's that like for you?
[01:07:14.795 --> 01:07:27.201]  Yeah, you know, it's pretty disgusting that she's even out there even speaking about stuff like this, because, you know, everybody knows she lied about her emails, she lied about what happened in Benghazi, and, you know, even to the families, right to the face of the families of the fallen.
[01:07:27.302 --> 01:07:32.004]  So, it's pretty disgusting how she's going out talking like this.
[01:07:33.245 --> 01:07:37.507]  I've got my criticism of Trump, but my God, can you imagine what it would have been like if Hillary would have gotten in?
[01:07:39.828 --> 01:07:41.089]  A thousand times worse.
[01:07:41.709 --> 01:07:49.052]  I mean, that probably would have complete gun ban, or almost complete gun ban, and who knows of the chaos on the border.
[01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:50.233]  I mean, it'd be totally worse.
[01:07:51.854 --> 01:07:52.594]  That's a good point.
[01:07:53.254 --> 01:07:58.877]  I mean, you almost died, some of your friends died, a lot of people, innocent people died because of a stand down.
[01:07:58.917 --> 01:08:00.237]  We now know she ordered the stand down.
[01:08:00.978 --> 01:08:02.458]  People that you work with heard the stand down.
[01:08:02.859 --> 01:08:03.499]  You witnessed it.
[01:08:04.437 --> 01:08:07.741]  Have we ever figured out exactly why she did it and what was behind it?
[01:08:08.482 --> 01:08:11.827]  And then specifically, so it's on the record, you were there.
[01:08:11.927 --> 01:08:12.708]  What really did happen?
[01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:16.292]  You know, the standout that I know I heard was from the chief of base.
[01:08:17.073 --> 01:08:19.917]  But for other ones, every saying was the one that pretty much
[01:08:21.414 --> 01:08:32.961]  The fast company that was getting ready to deploy to Benghazi, they got told pretty much, don't go, go, don't go, go, or change into clothes, don't change into this, change back out, you know, and that just delays and delays.
[01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:38.904]  And you know, it's seconds that count, especially in a burning building under live fire.
[01:08:39.505 --> 01:08:41.026]  It's not minutes, it's seconds, you know.
[01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:46.375]  It's, you know, it caused the death of Rowan and Bob.
[01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:55.762]  Her lack of due diligence and keeping track of the security of the consulates killed Ambassador Stephen and Sean Smith because the consulate got attacked twice prior.
[01:08:55.782 --> 01:09:01.487]  I was there the second time it got attacked and there was only two security personnel that night when it got attacked the second time.
[01:09:01.967 --> 01:09:02.828]  So again, I mean, her
[01:09:04.759 --> 01:09:10.568]  It's just crazy the fact that she wants to tell Trump he needs to be in jail, she should be the one in jail just for her emails.
[01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:15.075]  I mean her private server which got compromised by foreign entities.
[01:09:15.837 --> 01:09:18.801]  I mean that's classified TS service.
[01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:24.645]  You know, if I would have did it as a service member, as an individual, I'd be in prison immediately.
[01:09:25.065 --> 01:09:27.086]  I mean, there wouldn't be no waiting for a trial.
[01:09:27.126 --> 01:09:28.067]  You'd go straight to jail.
[01:09:28.227 --> 01:09:29.007]  And then you would wait.
[01:09:29.527 --> 01:09:33.149]  Oh, it's like these people that take signed orders off the president's desk and hide them.
[01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:35.410]  That's stealing national security items.
[01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:36.571]  That's obstruction.
[01:09:36.611 --> 01:09:38.051]  I mean, that's just... but they just do it.
[01:09:38.252 --> 01:09:39.052]  Then they brag about it.
[01:09:39.687 --> 01:09:45.855]  Yeah, I mean, well, she's doing a, she's a keynote speaker for some cyber security company coming up.
[01:09:45.895 --> 01:09:47.016]  That's hilarious!
[01:09:47.117 --> 01:09:47.437]  Really?
[01:09:47.757 --> 01:09:51.703]  That'd be like having Jeffrey Dahmer, you know, do a talk against cannibalism.
[01:09:52.003 --> 01:09:53.665]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:09:54.066 --> 01:09:55.447]  The world is just, it's backwards.
[01:09:55.588 --> 01:09:56.449]  It's totally ass backwards.
[01:09:58.413 --> 01:10:09.579]  Colonel Schaefer, who has a lot of good sources, like a week after Benghazi happened, he said they were trying to get weapons caches in these warehouses, and that Hillary wanted them shipped into Syria to start that next war.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.401]  And a lot of that later, years later, came out.
[01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:24.188]  And I talked to other sources that said that was what happened, and that Hillary actually premeditatedly just wanted to get rid of the ambassador so that there wouldn't be any witnesses to the weapons transfer.
[01:10:25.715 --> 01:10:27.196]  Hey, that's totally possible.
[01:10:27.216 --> 01:10:28.917]  I mean, because I never saw any of the weapons.
[01:10:29.057 --> 01:10:31.679]  Again, that was more State Department than the agency stuff, so.
[01:10:32.659 --> 01:10:36.201]  And didn't some of the other local State Department people and others get warnings to get out?
[01:10:36.961 --> 01:10:38.903]  A bunch of them left, and then you guys were stuck there?
[01:10:39.943 --> 01:10:45.326]  When the USAID got attacked, a lot of other Americans were told to leave Benghazi.
[01:10:45.346 --> 01:10:49.769]  A lot of other Western consulates, they closed down.
[01:10:49.809 --> 01:10:53.531]  The Italians were still there, and I think the French were still there, but all the rest had moved out after that.
[01:10:54.655 --> 01:10:58.417]  And what about Hillary trying to blame some trailer for a movie about Mohammed?
[01:10:58.437 --> 01:11:02.479]  I mean, from all I saw, that was just a red herring to cover up why they really attacked.
[01:11:02.799 --> 01:11:04.540]  Yeah, that only had to do with Egypt.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:12.764]  You know, there's a lot of people, I don't think a lot of people remember that the embassy in Cairo had got overrun eight hours prior to Benghazi being attacked.
[01:11:13.364 --> 01:11:20.208]  And for them to even have military assets going towards the embassy during that time, just, again, the lack of
[01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:21.128]  Of course.
[01:11:43.643 --> 01:11:44.264]  We're good to go.
[01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:08.020]  Well, the Democrat portion of it definitely does.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:17.885]  I mean, what I understand is if Barr releases the information that they want, he'd be under criminal investigation for releasing, because he's not allowed to release it.
[01:12:19.645 --> 01:12:20.166]  Exactly.
[01:12:20.306 --> 01:12:25.768]  And then the Democrats continue to leak whatever they want, but they leak selectively to paint the picture they want.
[01:12:25.788 --> 01:12:29.410]  But now the President has said, you can release whatever you want, he has the authority to do that.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.851]  But that's still held up.
[01:12:31.871 --> 01:12:33.452]  But I wonder what's going to come out when that comes out.
[01:12:34.571 --> 01:12:37.492]  I don't think any, there's not going to be a smoking gun.
[01:12:37.512 --> 01:12:39.653]  I don't think anything big is going to happen.
[01:12:39.973 --> 01:12:49.577]  I don't, whatever, because a lot of this, I think a lot of them they can go read, or they could have read the whole entire unedacted thing if they went inside the skiff, but they refused to go into the skiff when I know.
[01:12:49.877 --> 01:12:50.718]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:12:50.778 --> 01:12:52.839]  Well, that's why Trump's saying not just
[01:12:53.945 --> 01:13:01.610]  Not just the unredacted Mueller report, but all the illegal spying that the Clintons and Obama engaged in during the campaign and after.
[01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:10.696]  That's what I'm saying is, they've still got people inside the intelligence agencies that are operating as a mutinous, rogue, stay-behind networks that are then working against the President.
[01:13:11.156 --> 01:13:13.018]  Yeah, it's pretty deep.
[01:13:13.158 --> 01:13:17.761]  I mean, it's going to take years, if not decades, to weed these people out.
[01:13:19.382 --> 01:13:20.703]  How many years ago is Benghazi now?
[01:13:21.743 --> 01:13:22.664]  About seven years.
[01:13:24.062 --> 01:13:25.803]  Are you more angry now or less angry now?
[01:13:27.023 --> 01:13:27.963]  I'd say about the same.
[01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.764]  There's no more, no less.
[01:13:29.784 --> 01:13:39.286]  I mean it's pretty mind-boggling that nobody's actually been held accountable for the inactions that the government at the time had taken.
[01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:40.667]  We also forget
[01:13:41.878 --> 01:13:52.195]  And you know all the specifics, but going back in memory, you guys got threatened a lot when she was lying about you not to speak out, and basically Obama was ordering people not to speak out, but you guys did the right thing and did speak out.
[01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:53.858]  I remember you went on Megyn Kelly and things like that.
[01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:54.782]  Yeah, we did.
[01:13:54.822 --> 01:13:58.765]  We were told we had to sign a couple extra nondisclosure agreements.
[01:13:59.326 --> 01:14:01.128]  We were never threatened not to speak out.
[01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:03.850]  We were just told don't go to the media and speak.
[01:14:04.031 --> 01:14:07.074]  If you want to speak, go in front of Congress, go in front of the committees and talk.
[01:14:07.574 --> 01:14:16.142]  But for our job, what we were doing, speaking to the media, we definitely would lose our job, but then we could also be criminally charged for
[01:14:16.883 --> 01:14:17.483]  Reveal and classify.
[01:14:17.523 --> 01:14:18.844]  But what made you guys go ahead and do it?
[01:14:19.065 --> 01:14:20.105]  Just because you know Hillary was lying?
[01:14:20.566 --> 01:14:29.011]  That and we went and we did testify and they still kept the same story about how it happened and what happened and why it happened and we just said nope that's it we're done.
[01:14:29.572 --> 01:14:31.473]  So you went through the channels like you were supposed to?
[01:14:31.493 --> 01:14:31.553]  Yep.
[01:14:32.133 --> 01:14:37.337]  And then they didn't do anything and that's why under law when whistleblowing is protected is when you've gone through channels and then they don't do anything.
[01:14:37.737 --> 01:14:39.418]  Yep, and that's why we would.
[01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:40.799]  Everybody says, well, why'd you do a book?
[01:14:40.859 --> 01:14:41.999]  Why'd you just come talk to the media?
[01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:49.283]  Well, the problem is you go on, say you go on Fox News, they'll spin it, what you say, they'll spin it to where, how they want it to sound.
[01:14:49.303 --> 01:14:51.884]  But if you put it in a book, it's written down, you cannot change the source.
[01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:52.785]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:14:52.805 --> 01:14:56.647]  There's this idea that, you know, you've been in the military a long time, dangerous parts of the world.
[01:14:56.847 --> 01:14:58.168]  People want to read what you had to say.
[01:14:58.568 --> 01:14:59.789]  This is all public what went on.
[01:14:59.809 --> 01:15:01.009]  They're putting their lives out about it.
[01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:03.811]  And then it's bad when you lose all your contracting jobs.
[01:15:04.591 --> 01:15:09.596]  That you then try to write a book to get your name back, to tell the truth, and to fund yourself.
[01:15:09.976 --> 01:15:11.898]  American patriots should be proud.
[01:15:11.938 --> 01:15:13.659]  People should buy the books you've been involved in.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.881]  They should see the films.
[01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:16.202]  They should support you.
[01:15:16.482 --> 01:15:18.964]  Because people pay a price for telling the truth.
[01:15:19.284 --> 01:15:24.990]  And if we, as Americans, don't economically support people that are patriots, well then, we get what we deserve.
[01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:29.871]  Yeah, I mean, we totally lost our source of income and, you know, pretty much our way of life.
[01:15:29.951 --> 01:15:32.091]  It went from a private life to a public life.
[01:15:32.872 --> 01:15:34.052]  And just like that.
[01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:35.272]  And you didn't start it.
[01:15:35.312 --> 01:15:36.432]  Hillary ordered the stand down.
[01:15:36.552 --> 01:15:37.233]  The people died.
[01:15:37.473 --> 01:15:38.313]  Then she lied about it.
[01:15:38.793 --> 01:15:39.893]  You were put in that position.
[01:15:39.933 --> 01:15:40.733]  You did the right thing.
[01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:41.433]  So you're a hero.
[01:15:41.734 --> 01:15:43.634]  Not just what you did on the ground, but the moral courage.
[01:15:44.154 --> 01:15:48.015]  And I want to point that out to people, what we've gone through, what you go through to tell the truth.
[01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:51.558]  They want to shut us up because we're telling the truth and we're not going to do it.
[01:15:51.578 --> 01:15:53.520]  So I want to thank the audience for all your support.
[01:15:53.741 --> 01:15:56.223]  You're the reason we're still on the air in defiance of their fraud.
[01:15:56.624 --> 01:16:00.729]  You're doing some other exciting stuff we'll talk about when we come back with one of the great heroes of Benghazi.
[01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:08.412]  If you think gun control or something like that is gonna change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[01:16:09.233 --> 01:16:11.754]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're gonna do.
[01:16:11.814 --> 01:16:14.275]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm gonna do.
[01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:16.477]  And that's gonna worry you a lot more.
[01:16:16.837 --> 01:16:19.999]  Lawdawg, if you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.521]  You die first, get it?
[01:16:24.421 --> 01:16:29.644]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[01:16:29.684 --> 01:16:30.845]  He's bluffing, let's rush him.
[01:16:30.945 --> 01:16:31.025]  No!
[01:16:32.526 --> 01:16:34.968]  You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[01:16:35.308 --> 01:16:39.370]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:44.513]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[01:16:44.593 --> 01:16:50.337]  We all know that right now, guns is a totem, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[01:16:50.377 --> 01:16:51.738]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud.
[01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:53.479]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[01:16:53.499 --> 01:16:55.620]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[01:16:55.899 --> 01:16:57.900]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.761]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[01:17:01.061 --> 01:17:02.422]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[01:17:02.542 --> 01:17:09.565]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[01:17:09.745 --> 01:17:17.648]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever
[01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:22.690]  Hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:23.490]  So what are you gonna do?
[01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:24.450]  Outlaw everything?
[01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:25.551]  That ain't the answer.
[01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:29.252]  Just put some... Put some controls?
[01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:33.694]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[01:17:34.034 --> 01:17:35.234]  No, not so you can't.
[01:17:35.274 --> 01:17:36.875]  Just so the idiots can't get home.
[01:17:36.995 --> 01:17:38.975]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[01:17:39.116 --> 01:17:40.176]  Are you serious about that?
[01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.576]  Are you seriously?
[01:17:42.017 --> 01:17:42.917]  What good will that do?
[01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:44.598]  Oh my God.
[01:17:45.539 --> 01:17:47.020]  We had our Civil War.
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:55.868]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[01:17:56.508 --> 01:17:58.350]  So I agree with that.
[01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.572]  I think that's an important part of our existence.
[01:18:00.672 --> 01:18:05.476]  It's basically that simple.
[01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:06.997]  Infowars.
[01:18:07.497 --> 01:18:10.260]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:27.004]  We made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[01:18:27.164 --> 01:18:31.827]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[01:18:31.847 --> 01:18:38.251]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with InfoWars.com.
[01:18:38.671 --> 01:18:42.313]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify.
[01:18:42.914 --> 01:18:44.575]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[01:18:50.078 --> 01:18:50.698]  Get your order first.
[01:18:50.718 --> 01:18:53.559]  InfoWars4.com, InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:54.760]  Okay, it's true.
[01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:09.131]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:36.837]  John Teigen is my guest.
[01:20:36.857 --> 01:20:37.697]  He goes by Tig.
[01:20:38.578 --> 01:20:39.858]  And of course, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:42.400]  He was correcting me during the break.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.441]  He said he's made no money off the big Benghazi book.
[01:20:46.202 --> 01:20:46.522]  Nope.
[01:20:46.582 --> 01:20:47.542]  And that's the crazy thing.
[01:20:48.022 --> 01:20:48.623]  Tell us about that.
[01:20:49.123 --> 01:20:53.545]  No, I guess they said that we have to sell like over three million books before we make anything.
[01:20:53.585 --> 01:20:56.807]  And even then, I think we make like three cents a book or something like that.
[01:20:57.487 --> 01:20:58.468]  So... Who signed that deal?
[01:20:59.048 --> 01:21:02.851]  Well, there's five of us involved, and plus we added Roan's kid in there, too.
[01:21:02.871 --> 01:21:03.311]  That's good.
[01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:05.292]  Yeah, so it's split up.
[01:21:05.472 --> 01:21:06.993]  That's pretty much the reason why.
[01:21:07.013 --> 01:21:07.554]  I understand.
[01:21:07.674 --> 01:21:08.935]  But again, we didn't do it for the money.
[01:21:08.995 --> 01:21:10.235]  We did it to get the story out.
[01:21:11.136 --> 01:21:11.576]  That's fine.
[01:21:12.137 --> 01:21:18.101]  But I still think it's okay for patriots, when they sacrifice a lot, and didn't ask to be in the story, to be able to make money off of it.
[01:21:18.521 --> 01:21:19.201]  Yeah, you should be able to.
[01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:22.323]  Because the left always is telling us we can't have our own operations.
[01:21:22.383 --> 01:21:23.364]  We can't speak.
[01:21:23.384 --> 01:21:27.567]  But then all they do is take our money from us, and taxpayer money, and then use it against us.
[01:21:28.157 --> 01:21:29.578]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:21:29.638 --> 01:21:30.798]  I mean, they do it.
[01:21:30.938 --> 01:21:34.100]  They'll sell themselves out and make money off of it, but we can't.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.381]  All you guys need to sell published books.
[01:21:37.121 --> 01:21:37.301]  Yeah.
[01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:40.743]  I'm telling you, you won't sell 3 million copies, but you'll get the word out and you'll support yourself.
[01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:45.345]  Because I know you travel the country and speak, so let's talk about that and this awesome firearm you've got over here.
[01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:48.347]  Radio listeners should go to your website, or where can they go and look at it?
[01:21:48.967 --> 01:21:50.348]  Well, it's not on the website.
[01:21:50.428 --> 01:21:52.008]  It's a one-of-a-kind Tommy gun.
[01:21:52.028 --> 01:21:55.030]  I got it from... I just want to say I can see photos of it.
[01:21:56.482 --> 01:21:59.365]  TV viewers can obviously see this, and I like how it's in a guitar case.
[01:21:59.585 --> 01:22:00.386]  Oh yeah, you gotta have it.
[01:22:00.486 --> 01:22:01.146]  It's a Tommy gun.
[01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:02.408]  It's gotta be in a guitar case.
[01:22:02.868 --> 01:22:07.072]  So it's a one-of-a-kind from Car Firearms, the Tommy gun.
[01:22:08.774 --> 01:22:10.095]  It's a tribute.
[01:22:10.595 --> 01:22:11.596]  Sorry, I didn't mean to flag you there.
[01:22:12.157 --> 01:22:15.300]  It's a tribute to Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith.
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.142]  I got a TIG series.
[01:22:19.295 --> 01:22:20.517]  There's a card.
[01:22:20.537 --> 01:22:21.959]  They did a Tig series.
[01:22:22.119 --> 01:22:23.622]  Tommy Gunn did about 1000 of them.
[01:22:24.102 --> 01:22:31.493]  I got number 911, obviously for 9 11 and the paid tribute to Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith, and that's what it's foreign.
[01:22:31.834 --> 01:22:34.638]  It's a one of a kind and hopefully the auction it off on June 22nd.
[01:22:36.049 --> 01:22:39.612]  You know, I haven't shot a Tommy gun in a long time, but they are so smooth shooting and fun.
[01:22:39.852 --> 01:22:40.192]  Oh, they are.
[01:22:40.232 --> 01:22:40.933]  They're a lot of fun.
[01:22:40.953 --> 01:22:42.474]  Have you tried one-handed yet?
[01:22:42.954 --> 01:22:43.234]  No.
[01:22:43.374 --> 01:22:43.695]  You can.
[01:22:43.715 --> 01:22:44.115]  You can hold them.
[01:22:44.175 --> 01:22:44.795]  It's so heavy.
[01:22:44.836 --> 01:22:46.136]  It takes a recoil.
[01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:47.357]  It's pretty cool.
[01:22:48.118 --> 01:22:51.420]  But it's, again, it's just a tribute rifle to honor the guy.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.481]  Shoots those .45s, huh?
[01:22:52.581 --> 01:22:53.002]  Yep, that's a .45.
[01:22:53.742 --> 01:22:54.963]  How far is it accurate out to?
[01:22:55.644 --> 01:22:57.285]  That I don't know, honestly.
[01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.106]  It's, you know, it's a handgun.
[01:22:59.146 --> 01:23:02.689]  Pretty much is a handgun bullet, but it's going to probably shoot a hundred yards plus.
[01:23:05.094 --> 01:23:07.936]  You know, some police departments in Asia and stuff use these.
[01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:08.436]  It's weird.
[01:23:09.717 --> 01:23:11.158]  Well, it's got the drum.
[01:23:11.318 --> 01:23:15.800]  It's got a 50-round drum that'll come with it and two 20-round magazines.
[01:23:16.201 --> 01:23:17.001]  I need to enter this.
[01:23:17.842 --> 01:23:19.062]  There's a raffle coming up or something?
[01:23:19.102 --> 01:23:20.023]  No, it'll be a live auction.
[01:23:20.523 --> 01:23:21.264]  Live auction!
[01:23:21.924 --> 01:23:25.526]  Okay, and then tell folks what the event is and how folks can be part of it.
[01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:34.152]  We call it the Warrior Weekend, but it's going to be Saturday, June 22nd at Reveley Peak Ranch in Burnett, Texas.
[01:23:35.154 --> 01:23:40.576]  And, uh, we have, uh, be able to shoot some, some, some full auto guns during the day.
[01:23:40.636 --> 01:23:44.677]  And, uh, you know, the seats for the gala, I think they're 125 bucks a seat.
[01:23:44.737 --> 01:23:47.618]  Again, it's a fundraiser for help veterans and first responders.
[01:23:47.698 --> 01:23:54.760]  And, you know, we got this, this Tommy gun, we got a couple other custom, uh, M1s and pistols that are going to be out there auctioned off as well.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.261]  And what's the best website?
[01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.601]  I've got a sheet here.
[01:23:57.641 --> 01:23:59.562]  We can do an over the head shot of this.
[01:23:59.662 --> 01:24:00.123]  It'd be great.
[01:24:00.343 --> 01:24:02.104]  It's theteigenfoundation.org.
[01:24:02.164 --> 01:24:03.384]  Theteigenfoundation.org.
[01:24:03.484 --> 01:24:03.664]  Yep.
[01:24:03.925 --> 01:24:05.105]  And of course, I love that.
[01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.806]  Even though I've known you a few years, I always butcher your name.
[01:24:06.826 --> 01:24:07.386]  I apologize.
[01:24:07.506 --> 01:24:08.047]  I'm used to it.
[01:24:08.107 --> 01:24:09.567]  Theteigenfoundation.org.
[01:24:10.448 --> 01:24:11.368]  I was saying it that way earlier.
[01:24:11.388 --> 01:24:12.109]  They were telling me different.
[01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:13.830]  I get to blame the producers in there.
[01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:17.291]  Yeah, and you know, we help... Tell us about the foundation.
[01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:18.292]  You're doing this for...
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.423]  Yeah, we're first responders and veterans.
[01:24:21.463 --> 01:24:23.224]  They get service dogs as their main goal.
[01:24:23.605 --> 01:24:28.249]  But then also, you know, we help them out with their homes, with any financial bills that they need.
[01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:34.395]  We send them for treatment for PTS, TBI treatments, and you know, we just do whatever we can when we can do it.
[01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:39.020]  Well, this is going to be a great event, and everybody needs to go get signed up for it before it overflows.
[01:24:39.801 --> 01:24:42.084]  And again, tell folks the best website to visit?
[01:24:42.885 --> 01:24:44.867]  TheTigenFoundation.org.
[01:24:44.907 --> 01:24:47.370]  That's T-I-E-G-E-N.
[01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:47.991]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:50.113]  TheTigenFoundation.org.
[01:24:50.193 --> 01:24:53.998]  And I'm going to email out this video today after we're live at
[01:24:55.106 --> 01:24:56.647]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:24:56.707 --> 01:24:59.427]  We can't tweet this, only our listeners can tweet.
[01:24:59.848 --> 01:25:04.189]  We've been banned everywhere because we have evil guests like Mr. Keegan on the show.
[01:25:05.049 --> 01:25:08.750]  And getting back to that, because you're going to ride shotgun with us with this pastor that's been censored.
[01:25:09.631 --> 01:25:14.232]  What do you make of the invasion at the border, the attacks on free speech, all the things that are happening?
[01:25:14.632 --> 01:25:16.873]  I never thought the left would go this criminal this fast.
[01:25:17.253 --> 01:25:20.856]  You know, it's funny, the left, they want to say Trump's trying to ban immigration.
[01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:23.999]  He's not trying to ban immigration, he's trying to stop illegal immigration.
[01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:27.542]  Trying to stop the illegals coming, and so we don't know who's coming across.
[01:25:27.882 --> 01:25:32.086]  Right now, it's what, you've got thousands, hundreds of thousands a month, isn't it now?
[01:25:32.186 --> 01:25:32.346]  Yes.
[01:25:32.386 --> 01:25:33.727]  Getting captured, getting caught.
[01:25:34.308 --> 01:25:35.089]  Those people just float.
[01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:36.110]  Overwhelming everywhere.
[01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:37.891]  Yeah, you don't... I mean, what government can handle?
[01:25:37.951 --> 01:25:39.352]  Nothing's like this ever happened in history.
[01:25:39.633 --> 01:25:41.935]  Even in Europe, the numbers weren't this high with the Islamists.
[01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:43.624]  Yeah, I mean, you need control.
[01:25:43.644 --> 01:25:48.448]  You need to control your population and the illegal population at the border.
[01:25:48.688 --> 01:25:49.449]  That's what borders are for.
[01:25:49.489 --> 01:25:52.051]  But, I mean, Pelosi says, oh, this will kill our country.
[01:25:52.071 --> 01:25:52.832]  We've never done this before.
[01:25:53.252 --> 01:25:55.034]  Yes, we've never had open borders like this before.
[01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.456]  Yeah, we've never had this many people trying to cross before.
[01:25:57.536 --> 01:25:58.617]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:25:58.817 --> 01:26:00.358]  What do you think President Trump should do?
[01:26:00.538 --> 01:26:06.503]  He's talking about declaring this emergency act a real emergency and put the regular military down there.
[01:26:07.544 --> 01:26:10.787]  Because if we just keep letting them use our system, it's already overwhelmed things.
[01:26:11.727 --> 01:26:19.272]  I mean, well, look at the two military guys who got apprehended by the Mexicans on the American side.
[01:26:19.793 --> 01:26:20.233]  Oh, that's right.
[01:26:20.273 --> 01:26:22.315]  We've now got Mexican troops disarming U.S.
[01:26:22.355 --> 01:26:22.755]  military.
[01:26:23.015 --> 01:26:24.516]  I mean, come on.
[01:26:24.916 --> 01:26:26.498]  Why not put the military on the border?
[01:26:26.518 --> 01:26:30.781]  I mean, you have border patrol agents who get firefights with the Mexican cartels down there.
[01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:32.542]  By the way, that's in the Constitution.
[01:26:32.602 --> 01:26:34.363]  I'm all for posse comitatus.
[01:26:34.383 --> 01:26:36.445]  I don't want troops doing police work on the streets.
[01:26:37.085 --> 01:26:41.148]  But it's in the Constitution that the military, that's where it's supposed to be, is on the border, right?
[01:26:41.388 --> 01:26:42.188]  That's what they're for.
[01:26:42.228 --> 01:26:45.309]  They're to protect our country from outside invasions.
[01:26:45.609 --> 01:26:46.290]  And that's what it is.
[01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:47.230]  It's a complete invasion.
[01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:50.991]  Why do you think the Democrats tried for a couple years to deny all this was happening?
[01:26:51.611 --> 01:26:59.674]  And say, oh, Trump's made... And now they admit it's happening, but they say the answer is just legalize everybody, which then will bring even more.
[01:27:00.894 --> 01:27:01.494]  They need the votes.
[01:27:02.214 --> 01:27:03.595]  Can I see that Tommy gun one more time?
[01:27:04.836 --> 01:27:08.218]  You know, I'm going to either send a crew to this or I'm going to come, because this is only in a few weeks.
[01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:09.399]  June 22nd.
[01:27:10.479 --> 01:27:12.280]  Tell me about this ranch and the event that's coming up.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.701]  It's a Reveley Peak Ranch.
[01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.142]  It's about 1,800 acres.
[01:27:15.362 --> 01:27:18.163]  It's about an hour, hour and 20 minutes north of here.
[01:27:18.924 --> 01:27:22.286]  And you know, it's just, it's got a bunch of shooting range out there.
[01:27:22.346 --> 01:27:24.867]  It's got a repelling tower, zip lines, got a lake.
[01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:26.088]  It's got a bunch of trails.
[01:27:26.388 --> 01:27:30.410]  What if I show up and showboat and get this as the highest bidder, huh?
[01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:33.112]  That'd be awesome.
[01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:34.899]  It is cool.
[01:27:34.979 --> 01:27:35.740]  I do need a Tommy Gun.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.480]  You know, I don't have one.
[01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:37.901]  That's a perfect one.
[01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:38.641]  It's one of a kind.
[01:27:39.862 --> 01:27:40.362]  It's nice.
[01:27:42.023 --> 01:27:43.324]  And again, what company made it?
[01:27:43.404 --> 01:27:44.124]  Car Firearms.
[01:27:44.464 --> 01:27:48.686]  They own Magnum Research and Tommy Gun and Auto Ordinance.
[01:27:49.507 --> 01:27:55.690]  So, yeah, they did a whole series of these and 9s and a .50 Cal Desert Eagle.
[01:27:56.673 --> 01:27:57.994]  They have a .50 cal one of these?
[01:27:58.295 --> 01:28:01.378]  No, not one of these, but a .50 cal Desert Eagle that you can take a series of.
[01:28:01.698 --> 01:28:04.821]  I'm saying, wow, a Tommy Gun shooting .50 cal, that'd be awesome.
[01:28:05.021 --> 01:28:07.483]  But that Desert Eagle .50 cal is different.
[01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:08.084]  It's shorter, right?
[01:28:08.104 --> 01:28:08.744]  It's something like that.
[01:28:08.765 --> 01:28:10.466]  Yeah, it's a handgun.
[01:28:10.486 --> 01:28:11.847]  And it's got one heck of a kick.
[01:28:12.608 --> 01:28:12.928]  I bet.
[01:28:12.968 --> 01:28:15.211]  You know, I've got one of those Spencer & Wesson .500s.
[01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.893]  And I shot a Buffalo with it.
[01:28:18.694 --> 01:28:19.335]  But I shot
[01:28:20.603 --> 01:28:25.586]  At his, like, 30 yards away, I shot at his shoulder, his heart, and actually hit him in my ass.
[01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:27.527]  So I'm not a very good shot with one of those.
[01:28:28.088 --> 01:28:28.948]  But hey, you dropped him.
[01:28:29.168 --> 01:28:35.973]  Can you, well, I took the whole cylinder, but can you be a good shot with one of those, like, Smith & Wesson 500s?
[01:28:36.033 --> 01:28:38.614]  I mean, is there a way to do it?
[01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:42.497]  Because I'm usually a pretty good shot with a revolver, and I can't hit the side of a barn door with one.
[01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:47.060]  Yeah, there's people, I can't, I'm not a very good revolver either, but there's people who can shoot those things pretty good.
[01:28:48.067 --> 01:28:49.008]  Alright, well look out.
[01:28:49.108 --> 01:28:52.709]  I may at least send a representative out there and get that Tommy gun for myself.
[01:28:53.029 --> 01:28:55.791]  Whatever you do, folks, go sign up for it and be there.
[01:28:55.811 --> 01:28:56.631]  It's for a good cause.
[01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:57.672]  We'll be back.
[01:28:57.692 --> 01:29:00.613]  Look at the attack on the First Amendment on this Friday, Global Edition.
[01:29:05.815 --> 01:29:21.887]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is in the ultimate economic democracy structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:29:21.907 --> 01:29:27.091]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach,
[01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:31.793]  It's reached so effective that that's why Facebook is waging war against InfoWars.
[01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:34.134]  That's why Instagram is waging war against InfoWars.
[01:29:34.514 --> 01:29:42.017]  That's why Google and YouTube and Twitter are waging war against InfoWars more than anyone else, is because it is the ultimate counter-China model.
[01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:49.980]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:30:00.067]  That because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[01:30:00.367 --> 01:30:05.771]  So by doing little things like, okay, we want a little de-democracy, we want a fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:30:05.811 --> 01:30:06.632]  Let's say that's what it is.
[01:30:06.672 --> 01:30:08.373]  So it's dealing with a particular health issue.
[01:30:08.553 --> 01:30:28.705]  Where you have the health industry pushing one product overwhelmingly, the big pharma, big companies, the corporate model, the Chinese model, the statist corporate model that China has promoted, against Infowars model, which is we're going to have an American created product, we're going to sell that directly to our own people, our people will decide whether they want to support it or not, and by choosing to buy little products like that,
[01:30:29.045 --> 01:30:42.390]  They're able to fuel this independent press that is the only one that is not dependent on billionaire donors or sugar daddies, that is not dependent on big corporate sponsors, that is not dependent on getting the approval of the social media giants in order to spread their message.
[01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:51.473]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model.
[01:30:51.673 --> 01:31:00.063]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:31:00.263 --> 01:31:09.794]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets and doing so in a way that's not corporate driven.
[01:31:09.974 --> 01:31:17.944]  The reason why they don't see news change at InfoWars or content change at InfoWars, except as requested or thought about by the audience, is because the audience controls it.
[01:31:17.964 --> 01:31:25.414]  Because the audience has chosen a self-supporting, self-sustaining economic model by making small contributions by buying products.
[01:31:26.135 --> 01:31:35.101]  They already want, at a more affordable rate, by sustaining it, they create a self-sustaining, self-supporting structure that is unique in the world, and that's why they wage war against it.
[01:31:35.121 --> 01:31:50.130]  And as long as the audience refuses to concede to that, or forfeit their economic contribution, as long as they continue to be involved, and continue to participate, and continue to partake, and continue this self-supporting, self-sustaining structure, there's nothing they can literally do to crush it or end it.
[01:31:50.891 --> 01:31:59.809]  They can try to limit the scope of the audience, they can try to limit the size of the microphone, but in the end we will find ways to reach them because the audience dictates and determines it by its support of influence.
[01:32:09.622 --> 01:32:11.263]  We have a new super special.
[01:32:11.363 --> 01:32:13.284]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[01:32:13.944 --> 01:32:19.387]  The new, already best-selling Space Force America's Back awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[01:32:19.427 --> 01:32:20.308]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[01:32:20.408 --> 01:32:20.928]  Hope you get it.
[01:32:21.008 --> 01:32:21.749]  Sports broadcast.
[01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:22.229]  Spreads the word.
[01:32:22.249 --> 01:32:23.950]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.510]  It's 33% off.
[01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:26.651]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[01:32:26.851 --> 01:32:29.173]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[01:32:29.653 --> 01:32:31.794]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge
[01:32:31.914 --> 01:32:34.797]  That is the best go Q10, PQQ system.
[01:32:34.837 --> 01:32:36.738]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[01:32:36.758 --> 01:32:37.459]  50% off.
[01:32:37.539 --> 01:32:38.780]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.201]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.603]  Turbo Force, which is just changing our energy.
[01:32:42.764 --> 01:32:44.485]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[01:32:44.665 --> 01:32:46.507]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[01:32:46.647 --> 01:32:48.368]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[01:32:48.609 --> 01:32:51.171]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.

[01:32:55.094 --> 01:32:56.235]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:33:06.363 --> 01:33:09.025]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.675 --> 01:33:28.497]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:28.537 --> 01:33:29.938]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:30.198 --> 01:33:31.318]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:31.979 --> 01:33:38.241]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.017 --> 01:33:47.740]  Tegan is in studios with the Heroes of Benghazi.
[01:33:48.121 --> 01:33:51.783]  Once we start debating the name back and forth, then you can't, like, differentiate.
[01:33:51.803 --> 01:33:52.503]  It's an awesome name.
[01:33:52.523 --> 01:33:53.404]  We're the Heroes of Benghazi.
[01:33:53.424 --> 01:33:54.464]  He's riding a shotgun with us.
[01:33:55.445 --> 01:33:58.107]  And John, T-I-E-G-E-N dot com.
[01:33:58.367 --> 01:34:00.628]  Got a big event coming up here in about a week and a half or so.
[01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.750]  You'll want to find out about that on the website.
[01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:06.272]  But we have a guest here while we're focusing on free speech.
[01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:12.617]  Not the First Amendment, but in Canada, we have David J. Lynn, who's on the road, popping in.
[01:34:12.637 --> 01:34:14.118]  I'm going to play a few minutes of this first.
[01:34:14.478 --> 01:34:22.324]  There's an InfoWars.com article from two days ago about a street pastor attacked and arrested for preaching the gospel.
[01:34:23.525 --> 01:34:24.166]  That's right, folks.
[01:34:24.186 --> 01:34:30.971]  You don't just get banned on YouTube if a homosexual group calls itself queer and you quote the name of the group.
[01:34:32.338 --> 01:34:35.919]  No, ladies and gentlemen, if you're a preacher reading out of the Bible, you get arrested in Canada.
[01:34:36.419 --> 01:34:40.341]  In Sweden, if you criticize radical Islam or report criminal numbers, you get arrested.
[01:34:41.481 --> 01:34:43.862]  The left is coming after everybody's free speech.
[01:34:44.002 --> 01:34:50.664]  And even though we have governments in the United States that supposedly defend it, big tech and the universities are working against it.
[01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:54.566]  So there's a six-minute video up on InfoWars.com and Kellum Green's article.
[01:34:54.926 --> 01:34:56.527]  If you want to see it, it's very important.
[01:34:57.587 --> 01:35:00.068]  But we're going to play just a short excerpt of it here.
[01:35:00.108 --> 01:35:00.408]  Here it is.
[01:35:02.585 --> 01:35:04.766]  Everybody can have dignity and respect.
[01:35:04.926 --> 01:35:05.487]  Everybody.
[01:35:05.847 --> 01:35:09.149]  But you know, it's not all the time that this is carried out.
[01:35:09.609 --> 01:35:14.491]  Sometimes hatred is carried out by people of various members of the community.
[01:35:14.832 --> 01:35:17.093]  We're here to tell you that we hate nobody.
[01:35:17.353 --> 01:35:19.914]  So I'm coming out of the closet and saying I'm a Christian.
[01:35:20.555 --> 01:35:24.097]  And I want to know whether you would tolerate me as a Christian.
[01:35:24.477 --> 01:35:25.678]  Would you tolerate me, sir?
[01:35:26.498 --> 01:35:28.119]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:29.676 --> 01:35:30.577]  I don't want to engage.
[01:35:31.017 --> 01:35:32.999]  Ma'am, would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.361]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:35.742 --> 01:35:36.362]  Go away.
[01:35:37.263 --> 01:35:38.364]  Okay, so you're a bigot.
[01:35:39.325 --> 01:35:41.767]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:41.828 --> 01:35:43.889]  You don't want to talk to me.
[01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:45.731]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:48.013 --> 01:35:49.475]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:51.419 --> 01:35:53.460]  So you don't want to talk to me?
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.201]  You don't want to talk to me?
[01:35:55.381 --> 01:35:57.122]  You're telling me to get out?
[01:35:57.302 --> 01:35:58.203]  You don't want to talk to me?
[01:35:58.223 --> 01:36:00.104]  You have your bat's face towards me?
[01:36:00.224 --> 01:36:00.824]  Acceptance.
[01:36:00.884 --> 01:36:01.845]  What about acceptance?
[01:36:02.405 --> 01:36:03.126]  I accept you.
[01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:03.566]  You're here.
[01:36:03.626 --> 01:36:04.547]  You want to shake my hand?
[01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:05.507]  What did I say?
[01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:08.149]  Why do you need a microphone?
[01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:10.871]  So that people can hear the good news of Jesus Christ.
[01:36:12.009 --> 01:36:15.290]  Okay, so I'm just going to continue on with what I had to say.
[01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:19.092]  We have people that can't even say that they love me.
[01:36:19.472 --> 01:36:20.252]  No, no, no, no, no!
[01:36:20.332 --> 01:36:22.533]  They can't even say that they tolerate me.
[01:36:22.573 --> 01:36:23.033]  Except I love you.
[01:36:23.053 --> 01:36:23.613]  You don't accept me?
[01:36:23.633 --> 01:36:25.354]  Why would I have to get out of Toronto?
[01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:26.174]  This is a public sidewalk.
[01:36:26.254 --> 01:36:27.915]  And that's what we preach as Christians.
[01:36:27.935 --> 01:36:28.755]  That everybody is accepted.
[01:36:40.379 --> 01:36:41.880]  Jesus died for the sinner.
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.561]  Do you know that every person is a sinner?
[01:36:45.961 --> 01:36:47.001]  Don't touch me please.
[01:36:47.262 --> 01:36:48.582]  Please take that off my body.
[01:36:49.442 --> 01:36:51.103]  Every heterosexual has sinned.
[01:36:51.323 --> 01:36:53.864]  Every homosexual has sinned.
[01:36:54.004 --> 01:36:59.546]  And sin is when we violate the laws of God and we go contrary to the things of faith.
[01:36:59.986 --> 01:37:01.227]  That's what sin is.
[01:37:01.247 --> 01:37:05.028]  Alright, we're gonna get to our guest now and then come back next segment to show the arrest.
[01:37:05.848 --> 01:37:07.649]  But I gotta say, I believe everybody's free speech.
[01:37:09.053 --> 01:37:15.219]  But I've walked out of a restaurant before that's not even in a party area and had some guy go, you're going to hell with bad breath in my face.
[01:37:15.239 --> 01:37:17.581]  And I'm like, okay, dude, you're going to turn people off.
[01:37:17.641 --> 01:37:19.103]  And I'm not saying I'm against those street preachers.
[01:37:19.163 --> 01:37:21.845]  I'm saying this guy's very well-spoken, very nice.
[01:37:21.885 --> 01:37:22.666]  I've watched the whole video.
[01:37:22.686 --> 01:37:23.347]  We're going to get to it.
[01:37:23.847 --> 01:37:26.790]  And he gets arrested for what he's saying.
[01:37:27.531 --> 01:37:28.432]  John, this is pretty scary.
[01:37:30.254 --> 01:37:30.594]  It is.
[01:37:31.735 --> 01:37:34.197]  I wouldn't be surprised if you see that here in America soon.
[01:37:34.477 --> 01:37:38.460]  I mean, it seems to flow from over there to over here all the time.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:45.366]  And again, what you saw, I mean, he wasn't preaching any hate, no nothing, and he was saying, I accept you, but they're yelling at him.
[01:37:46.046 --> 01:37:47.267]  It's crazy.
[01:37:47.287 --> 01:37:52.912]  He's just simply telling him, though, that this is a very destructive lifestyle, which is his right to say, but if it isn't true, which it is.
[01:37:54.253 --> 01:37:56.414]  Let's go to David J. Lynn.
[01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:03.152]  And the best website for people to go to, I guess, would be ChristForgiveness.com.
[01:38:03.492 --> 01:38:04.333]  You've been arrested.
[01:38:04.573 --> 01:38:05.313]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:38:05.373 --> 01:38:08.074]  I know you're in your car, but you've got a good Skype connection now.
[01:38:08.714 --> 01:38:11.054]  Just for people that just tuned in, I don't think they understand.
[01:38:11.094 --> 01:38:12.715]  This is commonplace now in Canada.
[01:38:13.035 --> 01:38:19.316]  I hear about churches where the preachers are arrested because they read out of Leviticus and say that homosexual sex is a sin.
[01:38:19.336 --> 01:38:21.577]  I mean, this is widespread, isn't it?
[01:38:23.274 --> 01:38:26.455]  Yes, in fact many street preachers feel threatened.
[01:38:26.576 --> 01:38:36.840]  Many people that are just simply Christian are getting fired on the job or dismissed without pay for putting simple things like crosses on their desk or Bibles on their desk.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.221]  I myself was a victim of that many years ago.
[01:38:39.241 --> 01:38:49.886]  I worked for the largest media company in Canada and just by putting a Bible on my desk and having some good scriptures like love everybody on my cubicle
[01:38:50.723 --> 01:38:59.129]  I was not only told to take it down, but I was brought to human resources and my job was threatened if I didn't comply.
[01:38:59.149 --> 01:39:01.531]  And this is mainstream in Canada.
[01:39:01.791 --> 01:39:08.316]  It seems as though the laws are being set up in such a way that you can say anything except
[01:39:09.161 --> 01:39:11.682]  The Gospel, except things of the Bible.
[01:39:12.002 --> 01:39:15.963]  And I'm not even talking about the controversial scriptures.
[01:39:16.123 --> 01:39:19.385]  I'm talking about simply saying Jesus died on a cross.
[01:39:19.685 --> 01:39:23.206]  Simply saying, for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only begotten son.
[01:39:23.526 --> 01:39:28.768]  Because when I got arrested two or three days ago now, about two days ago,
[01:39:29.685 --> 01:39:32.509]  I didn't say anything specific to their community.
[01:39:32.749 --> 01:39:34.451]  All I said was God loves you.
[01:39:34.551 --> 01:39:35.452]  God cares for you.
[01:39:35.492 --> 01:39:36.914]  He's calling you to himself.
[01:39:37.375 --> 01:39:38.957]  I never said any trigger words.
[01:39:39.037 --> 01:39:41.480]  I never quoted any specific scripture.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:45.465]  And I want to be clear about this though because we've got
[01:39:46.597 --> 01:39:52.782]  Steven Crowder about to be banned off YouTube for a joke shirt with Che Guevara saying socialism is for figs.
[01:39:53.582 --> 01:39:57.665]  Well, I think he has the right to say for facts, and if I hate people I'm allowed to hate them.
[01:39:57.705 --> 01:40:00.527]  I don't hate them, but damn it, they're allowed to use whatever words they want.
[01:40:00.787 --> 01:40:10.094]  So as soon as you give in to saying, I didn't even say any of the words you say don't use, well there's always more words, and then it's a slippery slope, and pretty soon you're out there
[01:40:10.174 --> 01:40:18.419]  God loves you, Jesus loves you, and you're arrested, and now you'll be arrested for just being a Christian, and now you'll be in an underground secret church like China.
[01:40:18.719 --> 01:40:19.900]  That's where I think this is going.
[01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:23.662]  I 100% agree, and it's a shame.
[01:40:24.283 --> 01:40:26.884]  I shouldn't have to be ashamed to read the Bible.
[01:40:26.924 --> 01:40:30.126]  As far as I know, the Bible is not a banned book in Canada.
[01:40:30.426 --> 01:40:34.829]  There's churches on almost every block, and so what's happening in Canada is
[01:40:35.345 --> 01:40:42.256]  Should be a wake-up call to everyone in the United States and all throughout the world because this is spreading like wildfire.
[01:40:43.118 --> 01:40:49.949]  Our Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking with social media giants like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram.
[01:40:50.606 --> 01:41:01.616]  And setting rules that if they don't comply with his idea of freedom of speech, which is basically don't say anything biblical, that they'll be fined and they'll even be censored.
[01:41:01.656 --> 01:41:03.237]  And by the way, let me throw this in here.
[01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:04.098]  Exactly.
[01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.660]  Because our government won't say no to censorship.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:11.824]  It's allowing foreign governments like the EU, Canada, the Chinese to then come say what the policies are.
[01:41:12.145 --> 01:41:16.388]  And so by extension of that power vacuum, we're seeing governance from authoritarian regimes.
[01:41:16.889 --> 01:41:18.110]  And then if you expand on that,
[01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:24.474]  Again, there's more and more and more that they're saying that they find offensive or that they find hateful.
[01:41:24.494 --> 01:41:25.815]  This is extremely dangerous.
[01:41:27.076 --> 01:41:30.639]  Well, you can't have a real democracy unless you have the contrary opinion.
[01:41:30.719 --> 01:41:36.203]  And if you're not allowed to attempt to change somebody's mind,
[01:41:36.772 --> 01:41:39.653]  Then we're not living in a free democratic society at all.
[01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:40.993]  We're living in a dictatorship.
[01:41:41.093 --> 01:41:45.475]  In fact, if you're a radio listener, this is like Tiananmen Square level stuff.
[01:41:45.795 --> 01:41:53.758]  You're being taken away for saying Jesus loves you at an event that he's supposedly allowed to do.
[01:41:54.437 --> 01:41:56.298]  Yeah, it's a scary slope.
[01:41:56.378 --> 01:41:59.500]  I mean, Canada's definitely going in a bad direction.
[01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:07.626]  You know, just like Omar, she can criticize the Jews, but you sit and you criticize her, you get attacked because, well, now you're attacking Muslims.
[01:42:08.987 --> 01:42:10.268]  As you said, people are being...
[01:42:10.788 --> 01:42:11.788]  Fired off their radio.
[01:42:11.869 --> 01:42:12.789]  People are getting fined.
[01:42:13.049 --> 01:42:13.609]  They're getting in trouble.
[01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:14.830]  They talk about Ilhan Omar.
[01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:15.670]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:16.691]  Well, sir, stay there.
[01:42:16.731 --> 01:42:19.332]  I'm really impressed, David, with what you're doing.
[01:42:19.652 --> 01:42:24.854]  I want to show this to people, but if they're a radio listener, folks, you've got to go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:27.556]  You've got to see this for yourself.
[01:42:28.336 --> 01:42:31.417]  We're about to go to break, sir, but what did they arrest you for specifically?
[01:42:31.657 --> 01:42:32.618]  What are they charging you with?
[01:42:33.598 --> 01:42:35.500]  They're charging me with a breach of the peace.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:41.144]  They couldn't find any hate speech in my words, but they were trying to get me, and they even lied in court.
[01:42:41.424 --> 01:42:44.027]  I didn't even know the prosecutors could do that.
[01:42:44.087 --> 01:42:46.008]  They falsified quotes.
[01:42:46.529 --> 01:42:52.533]  They even vilified me by attaching me to a totally different person.
[01:42:52.854 --> 01:42:58.278]  The majority of the court reading for me to get bail was about somebody else.
[01:42:58.298 --> 01:42:59.099]  Wow, stay there.
[01:42:59.119 --> 01:43:00.220]  Incredible, incredible.
[01:43:02.801 --> 01:43:03.822]  It's time.
[01:43:04.643 --> 01:43:07.125]  It's time to start your summer with real power.
[01:43:07.145 --> 01:43:09.647]  The power that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[01:43:59.853 --> 01:44:02.936]  You'll find these amazing specials at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:11.725]  I personally don't want to hate people from the Middle East.
[01:44:13.027 --> 01:44:15.069]  And I personally don't want to be at war with Muslims.
[01:44:16.029 --> 01:44:19.652]  And I understand there's a larger globalist plan for a clash of civilizations.
[01:44:19.852 --> 01:44:31.261]  But if your daughter gets kicked down a subway stairs by a group of Islamicists because they think, you know, that she's a profane, you know, dog creature because she's a Christian or whatever, the police and the media try to cover it up and that's wrong.
[01:44:31.361 --> 01:44:32.402]  And so if a port
[01:44:32.722 --> 01:44:34.224]  I understand it's a manipulated collision.
[01:44:34.244 --> 01:44:35.405]  I understand it's a manipulated clash.
[01:44:35.425 --> 01:44:39.229]  But it doesn't change the fact if you're on the receiving end of it and capitulating to it.
[01:44:54.412 --> 01:45:01.036]  And going along and saying, oh, Islam's great, it's a religion of peace, there isn't a class of civilizations happening, only adds to the globalist program.
[01:45:01.576 --> 01:45:20.608]  We must be honest about the cancer that has become Islam in this current permutation, and the fact that the globalism is a cancer, and the fact that the left's system is cancer, and the fact that mainline churches that just want to be country clubs have become cancers, and that the 5G, and the GMO, and the big drug companies, knowing they're giving us stuff that kills us and makes us more depressed, they're a cancer too.
[01:45:20.668 --> 01:45:22.309]  There's a lot of damn evil going on here.
[01:45:22.409 --> 01:45:30.091]  So I don't sit here and shake my finger at the Muslims, like I'm high and mighty, like a Pharisee up here, or a hypocrite, and say, you're the only bad people in the world.
[01:45:30.191 --> 01:45:30.431]  No.
[01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.371]  We got a lot of evil going around here.
[01:45:32.391 --> 01:45:41.013]  You'll see examples in the US and in England, where they're trying to teach five-year-old boys and girls, boys they're girls and girls they're boys, and trying to teach five-year-olds about anal sex.
[01:45:41.213 --> 01:45:48.995]  And the Muslims come in there and they say, our kids are pulled out of here, and they protest, and then the school stops it, or says, Muslims don't have to go, but nobody else will stand for their kids.
[01:45:49.055 --> 01:45:49.855]  So that's the point
[01:45:49.855 --> 01:46:09.413]  I'm getting it here is is that we've got a lot of evil ideologies here and humanity has really lost touch with what civilization has given us and we are becoming animals in the civilization our ancestors built and I don't care where that is.
[01:46:10.509 --> 01:46:14.170]  I don't care if it's in Africa, the Middle East, the United States, Europe, Asia.
[01:46:14.250 --> 01:46:21.091]  You've got people that are becoming disconnected from reality and who are not self-aware, who will do basically anything at any time.
[01:46:21.171 --> 01:46:23.371]  And it's going to create a world meltdown.
[01:46:23.491 --> 01:46:25.072]  It's going to create a societal collapse.
[01:46:25.172 --> 01:46:30.933]  Because if you don't want to work, the systems will basically let you live for free, but you've got to follow their political aim to conquer.
[01:46:30.973 --> 01:46:33.093]  But if you want to be free, you've got to work more, more, more.
[01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:36.414]  But when you hit that point where the globalists finally take over,
[01:46:37.366 --> 01:46:42.159]  They're going to have their own weird right-wing backlash that I think is going to be very, very dangerous as well.
[01:46:42.982 --> 01:46:45.388]  It's a serious time, folks, and we need God more than ever.
[01:47:06.444 --> 01:47:09.063]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.375 --> 01:47:27.716]  John Tygan is our guest.
[01:47:27.736 --> 01:47:31.218]  One of the great patriots of Benghazi.
[01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:34.319]  Even bigger heroes having the will to stand up against Hillary.
[01:47:35.019 --> 01:47:37.581]  I think their going public against her is one of the reasons she lost.
[01:47:37.641 --> 01:47:39.502]  It definitely went into the secret sauce that did that.
[01:47:39.542 --> 01:47:39.862]  You agree?
[01:47:40.202 --> 01:47:40.922]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:47:41.042 --> 01:47:43.323]  I think it definitely ended her run.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:47.641]  We're going to have more about this after our next guest leaves.
[01:47:48.882 --> 01:47:58.388]  I got to tell you, David, Jay, Lynn, so much news breaks at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com that two days ago, they're like, hey, cover this, cover this.
[01:47:58.448 --> 01:47:58.988]  It's incredible.
[01:47:59.309 --> 01:48:00.089]  And I meant to cover it.
[01:48:00.129 --> 01:48:01.050]  I didn't get to it.
[01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:03.932]  And then I got home that night and I watched the video.
[01:48:04.992 --> 01:48:10.796]  And then I remembered all these other cases in Canada where they're really targeting Christians viciously.
[01:48:11.336 --> 01:48:12.057]  But like you said,
[01:48:13.306 --> 01:48:19.870]  Muslim call to prayer inside government buildings, pagan stuff all over, gay pride stuff all over, jobs.
[01:48:20.311 --> 01:48:25.955]  But if you even wear, I've seen articles out of Canada, a cross around your neck, people get pissed.
[01:48:26.575 --> 01:48:28.897]  And I think you were saying that you basically experienced that.
[01:48:28.937 --> 01:48:30.778]  I want to play some more of this video.
[01:48:30.818 --> 01:48:34.400]  But I got to say, you're a very well-spoken, calm, nice guy.
[01:48:35.021 --> 01:48:36.041]  Nicer than I would have been.
[01:48:36.081 --> 01:48:37.002]  And believe me, I work on it.
[01:48:37.242 --> 01:48:42.846]  When I go out and leftists are in my face, spitting on me, pushing me, dumping coffee on my head, I start, you know,
[01:48:43.166 --> 01:48:43.366]  Amen.
[01:48:43.386 --> 01:48:43.647]  You know, I...
[01:49:06.866 --> 01:49:23.309]  I'm in a position right now, it's sad because my sister informed me today that our Toronto Mayor has been siding with the LGBT community and it's inferring that I might not get a fair say.
[01:49:23.349 --> 01:49:24.410]  It's become political.
[01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:29.691]  In fact, the judges ruled totally in favor of the other community and I was assaulted.
[01:49:29.711 --> 01:49:30.991]  I was actually assaulted at
[01:49:31.923 --> 01:49:33.784]  I've got a lawyer that's got lawyers in Canada.
[01:49:33.804 --> 01:49:34.684]  He's actually here right now.
[01:49:34.764 --> 01:49:36.584]  So we'll get Norm Padas to call you later.
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:06.801]  Please, thank you, because, I mean, we're trying to raise funds, we're trying to do everything we can.
[01:50:07.522 --> 01:50:11.182]  Believe me, brother, I know what it's like to try to tell the truth, and I'm not saying I'm a victim, I'm a target.
[01:50:11.423 --> 01:50:19.205]  What is it like for you as a patriot, as an American, to watch this, John, unfolding with what's happening in Canada?
[01:50:19.225 --> 01:50:20.525]  Like you said, this is already coming here.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.563]  Yeah, again, it's just very disturbing.
[01:50:23.603 --> 01:50:28.789]  And again, I know what it's like to be targeted as well, obviously, because the left didn't like the fact that we came out and told the truth.
[01:50:28.809 --> 01:50:35.076]  You know, we get attacked every now and then by individuals, and it's sad.
[01:50:35.096 --> 01:50:37.779]  I always wish the officer... Hillary tried to get you killed.
[01:50:37.799 --> 01:50:38.380]  You're the bad guy.
[01:50:39.679 --> 01:50:45.543]  Well, people say that, but, you know, she'd be hiring the same people that are like me, so it'd be kind of hard.
[01:50:46.664 --> 01:50:52.127]  But, you know, it's... You would wish... She tried to basically... Oliver Mugazi, for sure.
[01:50:52.768 --> 01:50:55.029]  Get you guys killed that day, and then you're the bad guys.
[01:50:55.049 --> 01:50:55.930]  How dare you want to live?
[01:50:56.270 --> 01:51:00.873]  Yeah, I mean... But I wonder what it's like for her to be surrounded by guys that hate her guts.
[01:51:00.893 --> 01:51:02.434]  And I know a lot of you know more of them than I do.
[01:51:02.754 --> 01:51:04.796]  They literally all say she's a total monster.
[01:51:05.376 --> 01:51:07.156]  Oh yeah, I wish I could tell you the stories I've heard.
[01:51:08.377 --> 01:51:08.777]  I've heard them.
[01:51:08.797 --> 01:51:09.837]  We'll talk some about it in a minute.
[01:51:10.117 --> 01:51:12.417]  Well, sir, David, I want to invite you back on the War Room.
[01:51:12.457 --> 01:51:16.118]  I want to invite you back on my show for a full hour to talk about religion freedom.
[01:51:16.378 --> 01:51:19.479]  I want to play the rest of the tape we didn't get to of you being arrested.
[01:51:19.799 --> 01:51:20.879]  These people are assaulting you.
[01:51:20.919 --> 01:51:21.499]  They're pushing you.
[01:51:21.539 --> 01:51:22.299]  They're screaming at you.
[01:51:22.559 --> 01:51:23.439]  They're spitting on you.
[01:51:23.819 --> 01:51:29.620]  Obviously, there's always a lot of footage that people can't see because there's only one camera angle.
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:32.581]  The footage your eyes witnessed, what else didn't we see?
[01:51:34.211 --> 01:51:39.893]  Yeah, so what I want to say is that the police officer was actually a member of the LGBT community.
[01:51:39.933 --> 01:51:45.634]  He was wearing a rainbow flag on his uniform.
[01:51:46.094 --> 01:51:47.735]  So it's a gang now?
[01:51:47.795 --> 01:51:48.335]  It's a gang?
[01:51:49.395 --> 01:51:50.436]  Yes, it was a setup.
[01:51:50.876 --> 01:51:57.998]  Another thing that you didn't notice or someone might not notice is that they were already about to picket me before I even started preaching.
[01:51:58.258 --> 01:51:59.198]  So it was a setup.
[01:51:59.517 --> 01:52:01.077]  Because I posted my itinerary.
[01:52:01.277 --> 01:52:09.920]  We were going all around Toronto preaching the gospel to everybody, and they knew we were coming, and they already had their hate ready to be spewed at me.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.080]  So they want to silence you.
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.060]  Your message of love.
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:22.183]  Yes, and so those are two key ingredients to this whole story, and I'm actually the victim here, not the aggressor.
[01:52:22.743 --> 01:52:25.423]  I came there... Oh, we've seen the unedited video.
[01:52:25.443 --> 01:52:25.823]  We've got it.
[01:52:25.843 --> 01:52:27.144]  Let's go ahead and roll some more of that right now.
[01:52:27.364 --> 01:52:27.644]  Here it is.
[01:52:29.531 --> 01:52:33.112]  And becoming bigots and hate speech against my religion.
[01:52:33.172 --> 01:52:37.874]  And so if you're willing to look at the evidence, this is all on live stream right now.
[01:52:37.994 --> 01:52:39.555]  City TV News is right here.
[01:52:40.075 --> 01:52:44.137]  So I want to exercise my freedom.
[01:52:44.237 --> 01:52:47.418]  I chose this location as a product of Toronto.
[01:52:47.598 --> 01:52:49.959]  Does this have a special law in George and Wellesley?
[01:52:50.019 --> 01:52:50.319]  No.
[01:52:50.639 --> 01:52:53.520]  I don't want to continue this conversation anymore.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.801]  Officer, I'm going to preach over here and exercise my freedom.
[01:52:58.602 --> 01:53:04.124]  See, he's preaching in front of cops, and they still arrest him.
[01:53:07.006 --> 01:53:10.387]  It's totally legal.
[01:53:10.907 --> 01:53:12.688]  Now they cheer.
[01:53:12.748 --> 01:53:14.029]  Flip him off.
[01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:19.151]  So he's a Christian saying, I love you, but because he's a Christian, they hate him.
[01:53:20.467 --> 01:53:28.872]  How about bigotry?
[01:53:28.892 --> 01:53:36.717]  You know, people ask, I'm anti-police, I'm pro-police, but not when they're like, these aren't police, these are political thugs.
[01:53:37.337 --> 01:53:38.538]  These are tyrannical enforcers.
[01:53:38.718 --> 01:53:39.198]  Shame on them.
[01:53:39.459 --> 01:53:40.699]  Okay, well I'm being arrested.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:41.520]  For what?
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:42.380]  What did I do?
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:43.541]  You are not upholding the law.
[01:53:43.621 --> 01:53:47.203]  Yeah, the leftist got angry, they got violent, so he goes to jail.
[01:53:47.243 --> 01:53:47.724]  It's his fault.
[01:53:48.692 --> 01:53:49.312]  What did I do?
[01:53:49.832 --> 01:53:52.914]  I need to know what I did according to the law.
[01:53:52.954 --> 01:53:55.054]  This is against the law.
[01:53:55.334 --> 01:53:56.995]  This is against the law.
[01:53:57.815 --> 01:54:01.897]  Teague, what's really happening here?
[01:54:02.717 --> 01:54:04.217]  You know, they're going after the wrong person.
[01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:07.879]  I mean, they should be going after the aggressors, which were the protesters.
[01:54:07.899 --> 01:54:10.100]  They were the ones getting up in his face and attacking him.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:10.560]  He wasn't.
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:12.580]  He was, again, he was just preaching.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:13.741]  And notice he even retreated.
[01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:14.361]  Yeah, he did.
[01:54:14.401 --> 01:54:16.802]  And that's what I've noticed with the left, when you retreats when they attack.
[01:54:17.657 --> 01:54:18.497]  And I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:54:18.537 --> 01:54:19.338]  I'm glad you retreated.
[01:54:19.358 --> 01:54:21.619]  You're taking the upper, higher road, but man.
[01:54:22.179 --> 01:54:24.100]  Yeah, it's that thing.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.901]  It happens here, too, it seems like.
[01:54:26.161 --> 01:54:27.122]  It ain't just in Canada.
[01:54:27.382 --> 01:54:30.163]  Oh, I've noticed that whenever they're yelling and screaming at me in the street, it happens all the time.
[01:54:30.203 --> 01:54:32.705]  When I left, one will get there, then two, then more.
[01:54:32.725 --> 01:54:36.086]  If I stand my ground, it'll be like 50 within about 10 minutes.
[01:54:36.467 --> 01:54:39.128]  And then as soon as I got to leave, they cheer and start chasing me.
[01:54:39.148 --> 01:54:42.170]  Because they want that feeling of they're in charge, they're routing you.
[01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:46.792]  Even though you're just going to pick your kids up or going to your job, it's weird psychology.
[01:54:46.972 --> 01:54:47.853]  It is.
[01:54:48.534 --> 01:54:49.875]  It emboldens them, it seems like.
[01:54:50.695 --> 01:54:51.036]  Exactly.
[01:54:51.056 --> 01:54:52.297]  It's like running from a wild dog.
[01:54:52.757 --> 01:54:55.960]  So, David, other points you'd like to make about what unfolded?
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:02.146]  This is just... It's one thing to read about preachers being arrested for preaching the gospel, but it's another thing to see it.
[01:55:03.922 --> 01:55:12.086]  You know, it's interesting because 30 minutes prior to arriving there, we had a conversation with two police officers, a neutral conversation, because we were preaching in another location.
[01:55:12.487 --> 01:55:16.008]  And what they told me was that there's nothing wrong with sharing a contrary point of view.
[01:55:16.068 --> 01:55:17.349]  You have all right to do that.
[01:55:17.409 --> 01:55:20.191]  If anybody became aggressive, I should call the police.
[01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:21.471]  They should be charged.
[01:55:21.892 --> 01:55:27.194]  And the interesting thing about it is that 30 minutes later, I actually got assaulted.
[01:55:27.695 --> 01:55:30.236]  The police were informed and I ended up getting arrested.
[01:55:30.598 --> 01:55:45.066]  What made things worse was that when I went to the prison, the police station, I was forced to stay there all night and for eight to nine hours, while I was there, or even longer, none of the guards helped me.
[01:55:45.126 --> 01:55:46.226]  I kept knocking on the door.
[01:55:46.247 --> 01:55:51.469]  I wanted to call my wife, who just gave birth to my three-month-old son.
[01:55:53.931 --> 01:55:54.911]  This is all on video.
[01:55:55.051 --> 01:55:56.592]  Nobody answered me.
[01:55:57.032 --> 01:55:59.974]  Even when they were in front of my cell, they purposely ignored me.
[01:56:00.393 --> 01:56:17.222]  And talk to all the other inmates except me and they wouldn't even allow me to use the phone to call my my wife and I don't know what I did to have this kind of ill treatment but but I was totally unjustly treated in this in this whole situation.
[01:56:17.582 --> 01:56:23.966]  And they're still going ahead with the charges and like you were saying it's in the news that they're gonna try to crucify you as an example that you're gonna shut your mouth.
[01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:28.573]  They gave me bail conditions, and what I do for a job is I do this full-time.
[01:56:28.893 --> 01:56:33.817]  I go to different street corners, predominantly Yonge and Dundas, the busiest intersection in Canada.
[01:56:34.457 --> 01:56:43.404]  And they gave me guidelines for bail saying that I can't be around any LGBT event, I can't go into a very broad area.
[01:56:44.228 --> 01:56:46.410]  Where a lot of the LGBT members are.
[01:56:47.911 --> 01:56:50.833]  So the very group you want to preach to about how they're in a cult.
[01:56:51.333 --> 01:56:53.635]  Because say what you want about people and their sexual orientation.
[01:56:53.895 --> 01:56:55.636]  The whole left is using this as a cult.
[01:56:56.136 --> 01:56:57.577]  And they're targeting kids and everything else.
[01:56:57.778 --> 01:56:58.298]  That's incredible.
[01:56:58.498 --> 01:57:02.401]  You've got to come back this Sunday for the Sunday show or on Monday, my friend.
[01:57:02.421 --> 01:57:04.903]  Because I want to do a whole hour on this and really walk through it.
[01:57:05.343 --> 01:57:06.043]  This is amazing.
[01:57:06.083 --> 01:57:08.285]  David J. Lynn.
[01:57:08.305 --> 01:57:09.706]  What's the best website for people to visit?
[01:57:10.956 --> 01:57:12.877]  ChristsForgiveness.com.
[01:57:12.917 --> 01:57:14.118]  It has all this information.
[01:57:14.158 --> 01:57:16.640]  It's Christs with an S. Forgiveness.com.
[01:57:17.061 --> 01:57:19.723]  And you can go to the GoFundMe.
[01:57:19.743 --> 01:57:21.164]  You can get to know about our ministry.
[01:57:21.184 --> 01:57:21.984]  We're not a cult.
[01:57:22.024 --> 01:57:22.885]  We love Jesus.
[01:57:22.905 --> 01:57:28.329]  We stand on the word of God, and we love all people, but we... Well, sir, obviously you're a well-spoken, nice Christian.
[01:57:28.409 --> 01:57:29.350]  You're the opposite of a cult.
[01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:30.571]  But if you were a cult, you have the right.
[01:57:30.831 --> 01:57:34.974]  The cult's what attacked you, and we damn well know what's going on.
[01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:36.075]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:57:36.355 --> 01:57:37.556]  We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[01:57:37.576 --> 01:57:39.097]  God bless you.
[01:57:40.202 --> 01:57:46.784]  Do five more minutes with my guests, and then I'm gonna go into all the other news and stuff I haven't hit, a lot of big breaking stuff, in hour number three.
[01:57:47.084 --> 01:57:48.744]  Remember, they're trying to censor us and shut us down.
[01:57:49.024 --> 01:57:50.504]  Spread the word, break their back.
[01:57:55.546 --> 01:57:57.246]  InfoWar.
[01:57:57.366 --> 01:58:02.027]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:58:03.067 --> 01:58:06.228]  This is CNN.
[01:58:08.171 --> 01:58:12.453]  You see Apple making these decisions, you know, based on, you know, if this is impacting us.
[01:58:12.893 --> 01:58:18.656]  Do you think that tech companies are in a position right now where they can self-regulate with some of these more sticky issues?
[01:58:19.876 --> 01:58:20.897]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[01:58:21.157 --> 01:58:25.859]  I run the richest company in the world, and I pay Chinese slave laborers, you know, a dollar a day.
[01:58:26.239 --> 01:58:33.122]  I've moved Apple to China and given your iCloud keys to their government, and now I'm bringing Chinese censorship here to America and working with Google to do it.
[01:58:33.142 --> 01:58:34.423]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:58:35.535 --> 01:58:50.067]  Do you think, I mean it's interesting to hear you say that, I, just having covered a lot of this over the last months, I keep coming back to this fundamental question, and you can tell me if this is too philosophical for you, but I come back to this fundamental question, do we as users just have to re-envision the idea of privacy?
[01:58:50.127 --> 01:58:51.508]  Is it a luxury at this point?
[01:58:51.708 --> 01:58:52.749]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[01:58:53.070 --> 01:58:56.152]  The New York Times says, quote, I leave the moral high ground.
[01:58:56.192 --> 01:58:59.235]  That Apple, via Tim Cook, leaves the moral high ground.
[01:59:00.251 --> 01:59:06.954]  So, our company pays zero taxes in China, and we run slave factories, but I'm helping shut down free speech in America.
[01:59:07.234 --> 01:59:09.115]  That makes me liberal.
[01:59:09.535 --> 01:59:18.519]  One of the interesting points today, and I know this is an issue near and dear to you and to Apple, you guys created a pride feature for Apple Watch.
[01:59:19.599 --> 01:59:27.743]  You know, just this morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake in celebration of a same-sex couple.
[01:59:28.923 --> 01:59:35.946]  As a leader in the community, as Apple has, you know, continuously stood in front of LGBTQ rights, what's your reaction?
[01:59:35.966 --> 01:59:37.307]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[01:59:37.547 --> 01:59:43.750]  I'm gay, but I don't say a word to China, even though I'm the biggest company in China, about how they execute gays.
[01:59:56.778 --> 02:00:03.541]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:08.543 --> 02:00:10.524]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:10.924 --> 02:00:12.265]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.595 --> 02:00:44.719]  John T. Teigen is our guest in studio here and you know you're here to promote this event and these things get bigger and bigger and I've heard this Prickler Ranch is an awesome place.
[02:00:45.119 --> 02:00:45.299]  Yeah.
[02:00:45.439 --> 02:00:52.061]  I'm tempted to try to get up there only an hour north of Austin but I don't want to say you're a shrieking violet but you know plug this sucker.
[02:00:52.081 --> 02:00:52.981]  People need to go to this.
[02:00:53.581 --> 02:00:55.722]  It's very exciting and it goes to a very good cause.
[02:00:55.962 --> 02:00:56.202]  It is.
[02:00:56.222 --> 02:00:58.263]  You know, we're bringing about 28 veterans in.
[02:00:58.323 --> 02:01:03.285]  We got a couple of Medal of Honor recipients, some other VIPs, and we're taking the veterans.
[02:01:03.305 --> 02:01:06.166]  We're going to let them shoot out of the helicopter, probably take them hog hunting.
[02:01:06.186 --> 02:01:08.828]  They can go fishing, you know, canoeing, whatever.
[02:01:08.848 --> 02:01:12.109]  I mean, there's all kinds of stuff out there to do, and then this place is kick-ass.
[02:01:12.469 --> 02:01:12.729]  It is.
[02:01:12.849 --> 02:01:19.275]  You know, they do a lot of Spartan races up there, so it's, you know, a lot of trails you can walk, you can ride, bike, motorcycle.
[02:01:20.416 --> 02:01:25.961]  You know, so Saturday, it's kind of open to the public for that first Saturday afternoon.
[02:01:25.981 --> 02:01:29.945]  You know, again, go out there and shoot guns, fish, you know, do whatever out there.
[02:01:30.185 --> 02:01:34.729]  But again, it's all... Sounds like a big old slice of Americana with a side of Texas.
[02:01:34.929 --> 02:01:35.509]  Of course it is.
[02:01:35.529 --> 02:01:42.551]  Then that evening, we'll have our fundraiser Saturday, the gala, which will auction off the one-of-a-kind Tommy gun.
[02:01:42.571 --> 02:01:43.771]  We have an M1 carbine.
[02:01:44.292 --> 02:01:45.352]  Again, that's a one-of-a-kind.
[02:01:45.372 --> 02:01:52.574]  We got some Vietnam stuff engraved on it in tribute to the Vietnam veterans and some other cool guns that we're going to have out there.
[02:01:52.594 --> 02:01:58.976]  And then Sunday, we have a Redneck Olympics, which is, you can picture a bunch of rednecks doing the Olympics.
[02:01:59.136 --> 02:02:02.557]  So it's like toilet seat, horseshoes, you know,
[02:02:03.917 --> 02:02:04.877]  Geez, I can't even think now.
[02:02:05.458 --> 02:02:06.638]  Sunflower seed spitting.
[02:02:07.218 --> 02:02:08.378]  All sorts of fun stuff.
[02:02:08.458 --> 02:02:09.679]  Shotgun golf.
[02:02:09.739 --> 02:02:10.479]  Rifle golf.
[02:02:11.339 --> 02:02:12.760]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:13.900]  Sounds like I need to come to this.
[02:02:15.381 --> 02:02:17.961]  I think we've got about 20 seats open to the public again.
[02:02:17.981 --> 02:02:19.642]  Oh, it's filling up quick.
[02:02:19.942 --> 02:02:21.222]  It's an auctioned off.
[02:02:21.242 --> 02:02:24.003]  You can go on the website and see what it is.
[02:02:24.463 --> 02:02:25.424]  You need to expand it then.
[02:02:25.444 --> 02:02:26.284]  I know this place is big.
[02:02:26.904 --> 02:02:27.344]  Oh, it is.
[02:02:27.384 --> 02:02:32.325]  You know, again, this is our first year, so we're hoping it's, you know, we're hoping it'll grow after this first year.
[02:02:32.365 --> 02:02:36.146]  We were doing it in Colorado, but we decided we wanted to make it bigger, so we moved to Texas.
[02:02:36.787 --> 02:02:37.307]  Gotta do it!
[02:02:37.567 --> 02:02:38.027]  Gotta do it.
[02:02:38.227 --> 02:02:40.968]  Hey, you were getting a little upset when I first told you.
[02:02:41.228 --> 02:02:42.028]  Hey, guys, pull it up.
[02:02:42.068 --> 02:02:42.348]  Here it is.
[02:02:42.368 --> 02:02:43.908]  When I told you this, you're kind of like, what?
[02:02:44.488 --> 02:02:47.809]  Europe's controversial overhaul of online copyright receives final approval.
[02:02:48.609 --> 02:02:49.890]  That's not the headline, guys.
[02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:54.511]  The actual headline is, was in AP, was in Reuters, Drudge had it linked on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:02:55.131 --> 02:03:05.976]  The actual headline, I want to show John this before he leaves, was something like, EU claims jurisdiction over World Wide Web.
[02:03:06.596 --> 02:03:09.237]  EU claims their copyright power extends across the whole world.
[02:03:09.637 --> 02:03:10.478]  That was the headline.
[02:03:11.378 --> 02:03:16.620]  And it's just crazy to see that, and then to also see what's happening to the street preacher.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.521]  I mean, to see that video.
[02:03:18.441 --> 02:03:21.302]  Yeah, it seems like censorship is going crazy around here.
[02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:24.863]  What are they trying to copyright everything that we do?
[02:03:24.883 --> 02:03:27.565]  I think that's what they're doing.
[02:03:27.605 --> 02:03:28.265]  Where's my phone?
[02:03:28.305 --> 02:03:29.266]  I'll pull it up on my phone.
[02:03:29.847 --> 02:03:31.308]  I have this OCD about headlines.
[02:03:31.728 --> 02:03:32.329]  I can't have them.
[02:03:32.389 --> 02:03:33.390]  I'm going to go crazy.
[02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:36.172]  Bring me Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday stacks.
[02:03:37.153 --> 02:03:38.514]  Bring me the stacks.
[02:03:39.254 --> 02:03:39.735]  There it is.
[02:03:40.675 --> 02:03:41.576]  Now that's Article 13.
[02:03:42.017 --> 02:03:43.278]  You guys aren't clicking news.
[02:03:44.579 --> 02:03:45.439]  You're clicking web.
[02:03:45.519 --> 02:03:46.580]  Article 13 memes.
[02:03:47.061 --> 02:03:49.363]  Exempt as UU backs controversial copyright law.
[02:03:50.157 --> 02:03:51.298]  Okay.
[02:03:52.059 --> 02:03:52.619]  It doesn't matter.
[02:03:52.639 --> 02:03:57.764]  I'm going to find it, and it's going to be so much fun.
[02:03:58.064 --> 02:03:59.465]  Bring me all three stacks.
[02:03:59.986 --> 02:04:01.667]  I covered it Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[02:04:02.187 --> 02:04:04.770]  The stack will be this high, and you'll be gone.
[02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:09.674]  You can tune in, and I will have it, because imagine the EU declaring jurisdiction over the U.S.
[02:04:11.175 --> 02:04:11.355]  No.
[02:04:11.375 --> 02:04:13.057]  Yeah, that ain't going to happen.
[02:04:14.321 --> 02:04:14.842]  It's crazy.
[02:04:15.522 --> 02:04:15.902]  Yeah.
[02:04:17.003 --> 02:04:20.907]  In the last minute we have, I presume, coming in, what would you call this period of time, John, we're in right now?
[02:04:23.249 --> 02:04:24.049]  Complete chaos.
[02:04:24.090 --> 02:04:28.954]  I mean, definitely, it seems like anything that's traditional is being attacked.
[02:04:29.194 --> 02:04:33.077]  I mean, everything's trying to be erased and rewritten by the left.
[02:04:33.177 --> 02:04:35.840]  I mean, if it's a positive message, they don't like it.
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:38.062]  That's what it seems like to me, anyways.
[02:04:38.482 --> 02:04:39.603]  It is certainly a crazy time.
[02:04:39.703 --> 02:04:41.605]  All right, well, you were in here, what, two years ago?
[02:04:42.961 --> 02:04:43.502]  Something like that.
[02:04:43.902 --> 02:04:46.144]  Well, let's get you in more often than two years, alright?
[02:04:46.584 --> 02:04:47.425]  It's a busy life, man.
[02:04:47.925 --> 02:04:48.425]  I know, I hear you.
[02:04:48.465 --> 02:04:49.126]  Thanks for coming in, buddy.
[02:04:49.146 --> 02:04:49.426]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:49.446 --> 02:04:49.786]  Thank you.
[02:04:49.987 --> 02:04:59.033]  Congratulations on all the success spreading Americana to the four corners of the planet and outliving that witch's wish to exterminate you, the whore Hillary.
[02:04:59.413 --> 02:05:00.074]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.134 --> 02:05:00.794]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:00.834 --> 02:05:01.255]  Stay with us.
[02:05:10.342 --> 02:05:12.003]  We have a new super special.
[02:05:12.083 --> 02:05:14.005]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[02:05:14.685 --> 02:05:20.129]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:21.030]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[02:05:21.150 --> 02:05:21.670]  Hope you get it.
[02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:22.491]  Supports broadcast.
[02:05:22.511 --> 02:05:23.091]  Spreads the word.
[02:05:23.251 --> 02:05:24.012]  Great conversation piece.
[02:05:24.112 --> 02:05:24.292]  It's 33% off.
[02:05:25.473 --> 02:05:27.394]  We sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[02:05:27.575 --> 02:05:30.436]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[02:05:30.657 --> 02:05:32.898]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:35.460]  That is the best GoQ10, PQQ system.
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.161]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[02:05:37.481 --> 02:05:39.543]  50% off, nobody gets close to that price.
[02:05:39.663 --> 02:05:40.943]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[02:05:41.084 --> 02:05:45.206]  Turbo Force, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[02:05:45.406 --> 02:05:47.228]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[02:05:47.368 --> 02:05:49.069]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[02:05:49.329 --> 02:05:50.669]  All of the Force products.
[02:05:50.769 --> 02:05:51.910]  It's got Force in the name.
[02:05:52.130 --> 02:05:55.691]  It's 50 to 30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:55.791 --> 02:06:03.092]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:07.233 --> 02:06:08.114]  You found it.
[02:06:08.434 --> 02:06:09.974]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:10.494 --> 02:06:12.735]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:22.976 --> 02:06:25.900]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:06:27.281 --> 02:06:29.364]  Say that chocolate to the beat.
[02:06:30.045 --> 02:06:33.349]  There's too much confusion.
[02:06:36.022 --> 02:06:55.191]  I want to pay you credit for this, because when we spoke in Davos after the... I want to pay you credit for this, because when we spoke in Davos after the Las Vegas mass shooting, I brought up the issue of bump fire stock and why it was legal when it was used to convert legal weapons to illegal ones.
[02:06:55.291 --> 02:06:57.012]  And you did ban bump fire stock.
[02:06:57.032 --> 02:06:57.432]  I ended it.
[02:06:57.612 --> 02:06:59.013]  I don't think you got enough credit for that.
[02:06:59.393 --> 02:07:03.795]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[02:07:04.515 --> 02:07:06.076]  What is your view of silences?
[02:07:06.436 --> 02:07:07.757]  Would you like to see those back?
[02:07:07.957 --> 02:07:09.478]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[02:07:09.618 --> 02:07:11.959]  I mean, nobody's talked about silences very much.
[02:07:11.979 --> 02:07:16.261]  They did talk about the bump stock, and we had it banned, and we're looking at that.
[02:07:16.341 --> 02:07:18.322]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[02:07:19.483 --> 02:07:20.783]  I don't love the idea of it.
[02:07:21.103 --> 02:07:21.864]  I don't like the idea.
[02:07:21.884 --> 02:07:24.365]  What's happening is crazy.
[02:07:25.029 --> 02:07:29.270]  Okay, it's crazy what's going on with schools, and not only in our country.
[02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:33.671]  I mean, not only in our country, but again... But America has this particular issue with gun violence.
[02:07:33.691 --> 02:07:35.032]  You and I have discussed this for years.
[02:07:35.212 --> 02:07:35.952]  Yeah, sure we have.
[02:07:35.972 --> 02:07:38.433]  There's been 150 mass shootings in America this year alone.
[02:07:38.513 --> 02:07:38.673]  Yeah.
[02:07:38.793 --> 02:07:41.394]  You know, in Britain, we have 35 gun deaths a year.
[02:07:41.754 --> 02:07:43.074]  In America today, there'll be 85.
[02:07:43.474 --> 02:07:44.895]  Yeah, but you know... Tomorrow, 85 and so on.
[02:07:44.955 --> 02:07:47.535]  But in London, you have... What can you do to change the culture?
[02:07:47.555 --> 02:07:49.496]  It appears in London, you have stabbings all over.
[02:07:49.516 --> 02:07:49.636]  Sure.
[02:07:49.656 --> 02:07:51.496]  I read an article where everyone's being stabbed.
[02:07:51.516 --> 02:07:52.757]  We've had about 50-odd stabbings.
[02:07:52.777 --> 02:07:53.357]  People are being stabbed.
[02:07:53.777 --> 02:07:56.799]  We've had 50-odd murders with knives this year in London.
[02:07:56.819 --> 02:08:00.642]  Well, they said your hospital is a sea of blood all over the floors.
[02:08:00.682 --> 02:08:01.182]  We have a big problem.
[02:08:01.202 --> 02:08:02.383]  I'm not going to deny we have a problem with knife crime.
[02:08:02.403 --> 02:08:03.464]  It's a sea of blood and they don't have guns.
[02:08:03.484 --> 02:08:04.264]  We have a problem with knife crime.
[02:08:04.524 --> 02:08:08.947]  What do you think you can do as a president, though, to change the mindset about gun violence in America?
[02:08:08.967 --> 02:08:09.648]  Just talk about it.
[02:08:09.708 --> 02:08:10.688]  You have to talk about it.
[02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:18.714]  But, Piers, when somebody has a gun illegally and nobody else has a gun because the laws are that you can't have a gun, those people are gone.
[02:08:18.934 --> 02:08:19.794]  They have no choice.
[02:08:19.874 --> 02:08:20.815]  They have no chance.
[02:08:21.395 --> 02:08:22.136]  They have no chance.
[02:08:22.216 --> 02:08:23.457]  It's a very tough subject.
[02:08:24.238 --> 02:08:26.901]  But the bad guys are not getting rid of their guns.
[02:08:27.001 --> 02:08:28.462]  Pretty much everybody agrees with that.
[02:08:29.063 --> 02:08:32.127]  The people that obey the laws, if there was a law passed, they get rid of it.
[02:08:32.167 --> 02:08:33.388]  Those people are sitting ducks.
[02:08:34.298 --> 02:08:45.248]  You know, the one I think about the most is Paris, where they had so many people killed, where that wacky group of people went into the nightclub, and they just, boom, boom, boom.
[02:08:45.949 --> 02:08:52.374]  And they killed, like, tremendous numbers of people, horribly injured, so many more still in the hospital, I read the other day.
[02:08:53.275 --> 02:08:59.621]  No, but if we had, if there was a gun on the other side, if one or two or three of those people had a gun, it would have never happened.
[02:08:59.641 --> 02:09:00.722]  Here's my problem with that argument.
[02:09:01.002 --> 02:09:06.826]  More people were shot dead in America that week than have died from guns in Paris since the Second World War.
[02:09:07.147 --> 02:09:10.929]  I'm just telling you... I mean, the stats are so against that argument, aren't they?
[02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.890]  Well, what are you going to do?
[02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:13.511]  Are you going to take the guns away from hunters?
[02:09:13.531 --> 02:09:14.712]  You have hunters and you want guns.
[02:09:14.732 --> 02:09:16.733]  No, I think you can have special licenses for hunters.
[02:09:16.813 --> 02:09:22.417]  And actually, I sort of subscribe to the view of the right to bear arms, allowing someone to have a handgun or something, the home thing.
[02:09:22.758 --> 02:09:23.378]  I don't understand.
[02:09:23.398 --> 02:09:24.259]  I never have understood.
[02:09:24.699 --> 02:09:29.161]  Why anyone in America needs a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle at home?
[02:09:29.881 --> 02:09:30.461]  Why do they need it?
[02:09:30.481 --> 02:09:32.362]  Well, a lot of them use them for entertainment.
[02:09:32.402 --> 02:09:32.762]  They do.
[02:09:32.782 --> 02:09:34.483]  I mean, it's really... Are the guns entertaining?
[02:09:35.343 --> 02:09:36.824]  For some people, it's entertainment.
[02:09:36.844 --> 02:09:40.245]  They go out and they shoot and they go to ranges and they have a tremendous amount of fun.
[02:09:40.265 --> 02:09:42.266]  Sport shooting and specific hunting with licenses.
[02:09:42.326 --> 02:09:42.826]  I get that.
[02:09:43.107 --> 02:09:44.567]  What I don't get is the need.
[02:09:44.587 --> 02:09:48.949]  This guy in Vegas had 13 AR-15 assault rifles.
[02:09:49.429 --> 02:09:51.210]  He bought 52 guns in one year.
[02:09:51.730 --> 02:09:55.832]  And he was a sick guy, and if it wasn't guns, he would have done bombs, or he would have done something else.
[02:09:55.872 --> 02:09:57.432]  He was actually a pretty smart guy.
[02:09:57.452 --> 02:10:02.614]  He was supposedly a good, successful gambler, and there's almost no such thing as a successful gambler.
[02:10:03.234 --> 02:10:05.495]  And he went out, and he, what he did was incredible.
[02:10:05.515 --> 02:10:06.095]  Well, you did something.
[02:10:06.115 --> 02:10:07.876]  But he would have done... The bump fire stop was present.
[02:10:07.956 --> 02:10:10.977]  To give you credit on that again, you did get bump fire, stop fire.
[02:10:10.997 --> 02:10:11.878]  He used the bump stop.
[02:10:11.898 --> 02:10:12.518]  You got it banned.
[02:10:12.578 --> 02:10:12.718]  Right.
[02:10:12.978 --> 02:10:14.018]  And that will make a difference.
[02:10:14.038 --> 02:10:14.559]  Good.
[02:10:14.579 --> 02:10:16.279]  I urge you to carry on doing something on guns.
[02:10:16.379 --> 02:10:17.000]  Okay, thank you.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:20.241]  Because I think it would be great if the American gun violence
[02:10:21.141 --> 02:10:22.563]  Could be reduced in some way.
[02:10:22.803 --> 02:10:23.884]  I think we were both agree on that.
[02:10:24.184 --> 02:10:24.525]  We did.
[02:10:25.286 --> 02:10:27.288]  I want to pay you credit for this because when we spoke...
[02:10:36.061 --> 02:10:53.768]  In 2018, in the United States of America, tech giants Facebook, Apple, and Google have deemed the information coming from Alex Jones to be too dangerous for public consumption and have forbidden him from having a voice.
[02:10:55.748 --> 02:10:59.970]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[02:11:00.190 --> 02:11:01.070]  Never!
[02:11:01.670 --> 02:11:03.251]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[02:11:03.803 --> 02:11:16.393]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:11:17.714 --> 02:11:18.534]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:11:18.654 --> 02:11:27.601]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[02:11:27.781 --> 02:11:31.664]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:38.587 --> 02:11:47.529]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[02:11:47.849 --> 02:11:53.091]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[02:11:55.711 --> 02:12:01.193]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[02:12:03.769 --> 02:12:05.110]  They falsely edited him.
[02:12:07.553 --> 02:12:10.096]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:12:11.277 --> 02:12:16.042]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:12:19.646 --> 02:12:24.111]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:12:27.671 --> 02:12:32.254]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:12:32.475 --> 02:12:34.696]  And then we get hit and say, you know, don't use our software.
[02:12:35.817 --> 02:12:38.699]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.881]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:12:40.901 --> 02:12:42.942]  They just killed our stream.
[02:12:42.962 --> 02:12:43.203]  Really?
[02:12:43.343 --> 02:12:43.563]  Yep.
[02:12:43.683 --> 02:12:46.225]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:12:47.966 --> 02:12:48.867]  This is America.
[02:12:51.969 --> 02:12:53.030]  This is America in 2018.
[02:12:56.104 --> 02:13:01.545]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:13:03.745 --> 02:13:04.966]  Will you do nothing?
[02:13:05.906 --> 02:13:09.946]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[02:13:10.667 --> 02:13:17.628]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:13:18.628 --> 02:13:23.589]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:13:30.526 --> 02:13:35.312]  Alright, folks, we're back live on this Friday edition of Broadcasting Worldwide.
[02:13:36.093 --> 02:13:47.206]  And, you know, really, sitting back and looking at all of this, the left is just an authoritarian outreach of global government.
[02:13:48.305 --> 02:13:55.827]  And they're allied with the Chinese communists, they're allied with radical Islam, and they hate Christians, and they hate families, and they hate babies.
[02:13:56.708 --> 02:13:58.608]  And we're not just saying that to demonize them.
[02:13:59.209 --> 02:14:01.289]  They're the party of the bad people.
[02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:11.773]  And when you go look at liberals, whether they're in Canada, or whether they're in Asia, or whether they're... They all look like mentally lobotomized zombies or something.
[02:14:13.013 --> 02:14:15.114]  Because I wouldn't even call all of us conservatives.
[02:14:16.104 --> 02:14:18.265]  But just pro-human, common-sense type people.
[02:14:18.926 --> 02:14:24.248]  We're very open-minded, we're very tolerant, but we won't be dominated, won't have our views changed.
[02:14:24.829 --> 02:14:30.332]  So the left, before they took over, they were tolerant because they wanted you to be tolerant of them, but they're not tolerant of us.
[02:14:32.153 --> 02:14:39.657]  And they seek after power, and they seek after virtue signaling to each other about how great they are and how good they are.
[02:14:41.084 --> 02:14:51.388]  Now I'm going to come back and hit some other reports that have been breaking on some big issues that we haven't hit yet, and what's happening with the tariffs on the economy, and so much more.
[02:14:52.348 --> 02:14:57.450]  And then I've said I'm going to do this for a week or so, and I haven't done it, and the contest is over in a few days.
[02:14:58.151 --> 02:15:08.555]  So I want to play some of these great reports that people have entered for a $5,000 contest for street activism, getting the word about Infowars being censored out.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:10.860]  So, very, very exciting.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.181]  That's all coming up.
[02:15:13.901 --> 02:15:28.464]  But I'll say it for the thousandth time, like I said this week, every day, and AP and Reuters and all the top news headlines everywhere you saw, on Drudge Report, everywhere else, that the EU is declaring jurisdiction over the Internet.
[02:15:29.424 --> 02:15:30.005]  Worldwide.
[02:15:30.845 --> 02:15:34.886]  And because we haven't stood up to that, by extension, they now have that control.
[02:15:35.226 --> 02:15:35.826]  That is a
[02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:39.092]  Big deal, and we did find it, Bloomberg.
[02:15:39.212 --> 02:15:43.415]  Facebook may be told to censor users' hateful posts globally.
[02:15:43.856 --> 02:15:44.836]  That's just one of them.
[02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:48.520]  European considers international crackdown on Facebook hate speech.
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:49.821]  See, this is here.
[02:15:50.581 --> 02:15:53.404]  The left, the globalists opening the borders are making their move.
[02:15:53.684 --> 02:15:57.667]  This is a global war, and things are going to get real bad if we don't stand up to this.
[02:15:58.188 --> 02:15:59.629]  This is beyond critical.
[02:16:05.459 --> 02:16:09.622]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:16:10.843 --> 02:16:15.287]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[02:16:15.947 --> 02:16:17.508]  What is your view of silencers?
[02:16:17.528 --> 02:16:18.069]  I don't like it.
[02:16:18.089 --> 02:16:19.210]  Would you like to see those banned?
[02:16:19.410 --> 02:16:20.931]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[02:16:21.051 --> 02:16:23.393]  I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much.
[02:16:23.433 --> 02:16:27.716]  They did talk about the bump stock that we had at band and we're looking at that.
[02:16:27.776 --> 02:16:29.778]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[02:16:30.919 --> 02:16:32.220]  I don't love the idea of it.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.041]  I don't like the idea what's happening is
[02:16:35.442 --> 02:16:35.782]  Crazy.
[02:16:36.563 --> 02:16:37.384]  Okay, it's crazy.
[02:16:37.704 --> 02:16:38.765]  Mark your calendars.
[02:16:39.306 --> 02:16:40.787]  June 6, 2019.
[02:16:41.168 --> 02:16:51.238]  Trump does an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Anti-Gun, in England, and says he's seriously looking at banning suppressors or silencers.
[02:16:51.818 --> 02:16:58.722]  I've got an article right here from the ATF admitting that millions of these have been sold and that almost no crimes have been committed.
[02:16:59.323 --> 02:17:01.704]  But regardless, people commit crimes with automobiles.
[02:17:01.744 --> 02:17:03.545]  They commit crimes with baseball bats.
[02:17:03.685 --> 02:17:09.489]  You don't ban butcher knives or automobiles or baseball bats because they were using crimes.
[02:17:09.789 --> 02:17:10.930]  Because criminals used them.
[02:17:12.211 --> 02:17:17.154]  I gave Trump a pass after the Vegas massacre, which turned out to be an Islamic attack they covered up.
[02:17:18.339 --> 02:17:23.580]  When he went after bump stocks, because bump stocks are basically worthless and are pieces of crap.
[02:17:24.041 --> 02:17:26.201]  But my listener said, Jones, you're wrong.
[02:17:26.781 --> 02:17:35.744]  The fact that Trump got political points talking about this means that when there are future events, he will blame the firearm or accessories.
[02:17:36.664 --> 02:17:37.624]  Well, guess what, listeners?
[02:17:37.704 --> 02:17:38.144]  You're right.
[02:17:38.784 --> 02:17:40.065]  So I'm telling President Trump this.
[02:17:41.109 --> 02:17:42.831]  The Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[02:17:43.391 --> 02:17:44.552]  There's massive pressure to do it.
[02:17:44.572 --> 02:17:47.094]  It's not going to stop criminals committing crimes.
[02:17:47.655 --> 02:18:02.368]  And if you're going to blame the 10 million plus silencer and suppressor owners in this country because some wound up guy in a gun-free zone went and attacked his co-workers and had one in his truck, then that's my line of the sand.
[02:18:03.902 --> 02:18:07.264]  President Trump, if you become Hillary Clinton, what's the point of supporting it?
[02:18:07.305 --> 02:18:11.848]  You think you're going to garner support from Pierce Morgan and the left by doing things like this?
[02:18:12.428 --> 02:18:15.150]  All you're going to do is turn your base against you.
[02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:18.052]  So I'm going to tell you what I told Pierce Morgan on CNN.
[02:18:19.213 --> 02:18:20.234]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:18:20.774 --> 02:18:21.755]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:18:22.336 --> 02:18:23.156]  Mao took the guns.
[02:18:23.536 --> 02:18:28.140]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:29.461]  Damn it, Trump!
[02:18:31.226 --> 02:18:34.029]  At least you said at the end of the clip, well, you're not inclined to do it.
[02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:36.351]  Okay, but you're giving it lip service.
[02:18:36.991 --> 02:18:45.719]  Once you ban bump stocks, and that whole fake story of what happened when he knows a fraud, you open the door to blame the tools instead of the psychopaths.
[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:50.444]  And once you did that, you joined the deep state and the globalists, who are your mortal enemies?
[02:18:51.448 --> 02:18:56.229]  Trump, I want to support you, but dammit, you crossed the line on the Second Amendment.
[02:18:56.969 --> 02:19:01.191]  I'm sworn to defend this constitutional republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:19:01.591 --> 02:19:04.952]  And you crossed that line, you become an enemy of the republic.
[02:19:05.392 --> 02:19:08.773]  Trump, you know the right thing to do.
[02:19:09.613 --> 02:19:10.213]  You have been warned.
[02:19:12.557 --> 02:19:13.478]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:19:13.758 --> 02:19:14.800]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:15.961]  Mao took the guns.
[02:19:16.141 --> 02:19:17.683]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:19:17.723 --> 02:19:18.865]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:19:19.045 --> 02:19:24.331]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[02:19:24.511 --> 02:19:28.796]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[02:19:29.017 --> 02:19:30.338]  We will not relinquish them.
[02:19:30.538 --> 02:19:31.460]  Do you understand?
[02:19:32.048 --> 02:19:41.054]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[02:19:41.595 --> 02:19:43.396]  She says she got the best she could.
[02:19:44.037 --> 02:19:57.946]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[02:19:58.447 --> 02:19:59.568]  I could not do that.
[02:20:00.428 --> 02:20:02.189]  The votes weren't here.
[02:20:06.891 --> 02:20:16.054]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.134 --> 02:20:22.957]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:23.097 --> 02:20:29.560]  So, two days ago, the producers of this show said, you want to have guests on from the straight Pride Parade,
[02:20:31.098 --> 02:20:31.658]  In Boston.
[02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:34.000]  And I said, no.
[02:20:35.701 --> 02:20:39.944]  I said, if people try to violate their free speech, though, then I want them on, which will probably happen.
[02:20:39.964 --> 02:20:56.155]  Because, see, you can have a black pride group, you can have an organization of African Americans, you can have a Hispanic group like Metro La Raza, but white people can't have an organization because being white is inherently bad.
[02:20:56.215 --> 02:20:57.416]  How racist is that?
[02:20:58.942 --> 02:21:05.225]  And so yes, everywhere you go, the force feeding of an alternative lifestyle is going on.
[02:21:05.865 --> 02:21:15.289]  So when I say that I'm a libertarian and I don't try to judge people off their personal activities, that doesn't mean that I don't have a view that something somebody's doing could be destructive or bad.
[02:21:16.834 --> 02:21:23.677]  But if you look at Hollywood and the whole culture, they are exploiting people that are in the gay and lesbian lifestyle.
[02:21:24.258 --> 02:21:32.322]  The numbers of abuse and drug abuse and suicide and family violence, spousal violence, is just unprecedented.
[02:21:33.082 --> 02:21:37.024]  That doesn't mean there aren't some people that are really nice and live wonderful lives with little picket fences.
[02:21:38.165 --> 02:21:42.327]  It's just that the truth is, these are very nihilistic, destructive communities.
[02:21:43.484 --> 02:21:50.029]  And, you know, I don't say that from some high horse like I have been an angel cake myself, you know, in my life with things I've done.
[02:21:52.451 --> 02:22:04.960]  But it's just crazy how there's the seeking out of the children and the seeking out to violate other people's rights all over the world and street preachers being arrested and just the real wild-eyed authoritarianism.
[02:22:07.302 --> 02:22:08.843]  It's like the pro-vaccine lobby.
[02:22:08.983 --> 02:22:10.264]  You've had your vaccine.
[02:22:10.284 --> 02:22:11.705]  You're protected, supposedly.
[02:22:11.765 --> 02:22:12.786]  Why do I need to take it?
[02:22:13.677 --> 02:22:15.077]  You just want to get pissed off at me.
[02:22:16.938 --> 02:22:18.698]  So what you've got is a bunch of followers.
[02:22:19.958 --> 02:22:38.122]  And you've also got a lot of people that aren't alphas, or aspiring alphas, who get recruited into the homosexual lifestyle, not because they were actually attracted to the same sex, but because no one was attracted to them, and they kind of got sucked into it.
[02:22:39.335 --> 02:22:44.918]  And so if anything is a gang, you know, you got the Crips, you got the Bloods, some churches are gangs, cults.
[02:22:45.518 --> 02:22:50.461]  Let's just admit it, a lot of the LGBT community is a damn cult.
[02:22:51.381 --> 02:22:59.125]  A damn cult of leftism, abusing people, and blackmailing people, and controlling people, and it's not healthy, and it's not good.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:03.903]  You know, Mick Jagger famously said, oh, you get to a certain age, you learn everybody's bisexual.
[02:23:04.343 --> 02:23:08.766]  Well, Mick Jagger, not everybody's worth a billion dollars like you and running around in palaces all day.
[02:23:09.626 --> 02:23:10.587]  People have got families.
[02:23:10.607 --> 02:23:11.468]  They're leading lives.
[02:23:12.288 --> 02:23:13.389]  They're trying to pay their bills.
[02:23:13.449 --> 02:23:18.712]  They don't have time to hop around in, you know, fancy outfits all day and have sex with five dudes and ten women.
[02:23:19.593 --> 02:23:23.556]  So, this is really a decadent situation that we've gotten down to.
[02:23:24.551 --> 02:23:34.173]  And then you've got all these people in Hollywood and all these billionaires wanting to export their lifestyles onto us when we just want to have grandkids.
[02:23:34.853 --> 02:23:37.813]  But you see, the globalists, they don't want us to have grandkids.
[02:23:37.833 --> 02:23:38.793]  They don't want us to have cultures.
[02:23:39.074 --> 02:23:42.614]  They're all over the news saying the family sucks, the family's bad, get rid of it.
[02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:50.415]  You've got all the videos of them having dead babies fight with each other and abortion doctors having sex with dead babies.
[02:23:50.475 --> 02:23:53.136]  And yeah, we're not going to show that, obviously, but there's been indictments.
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:57.681]  What, you want to see baby dead babies being made to fight like a boxing match again?
[02:23:57.701 --> 02:23:59.982]  They'll never get to be in a real boxing match.
[02:24:00.002 --> 02:24:01.263]  They'll never get to go play soccer.
[02:24:01.983 --> 02:24:05.744]  They'll never get to have friends or go to school or get to be cool.
[02:24:06.264 --> 02:24:07.485]  What's that famous song about?
[02:24:08.145 --> 02:24:10.206]  Keep on rockin' in the free world.
[02:24:12.307 --> 02:24:13.467]  Now there's a woman in the dark.
[02:24:13.487 --> 02:24:14.828]  She's got a baby in her hands.
[02:24:15.968 --> 02:24:17.148]  But you know, she wants to take a hit.
[02:24:17.188 --> 02:24:18.449]  That's one more kid that'll never...
[02:24:19.588 --> 02:24:21.470]  Be cool, get to go to school.
[02:24:21.730 --> 02:24:23.832]  Let's intro the next segment with that if we can pull it up.
[02:24:23.872 --> 02:24:25.293]  By the way, this crew is badass.
[02:24:26.014 --> 02:24:30.257]  How they pull up stuff so fast that I kind of flip out on air, it has nothing to do with them.
[02:24:30.638 --> 02:24:39.325]  It is a neurotic thing I've developed, where I have all this data in my brain, and I know it sounds insane, and then I've got to show it to you.
[02:24:39.365 --> 02:24:44.670]  Like, I've got to show you the dead babies being made to fight with each other by two scumbag doctors.
[02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:45.951]  I don't want to watch it.
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.320]  But I need to watch it, you see.
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:50.641]  Because I need to get pissed and do something, you see.
[02:24:50.961 --> 02:24:52.582]  And see, they pulled it out, NewsWorks.com.
[02:24:52.882 --> 02:24:56.243]  You need to get that out to everybody that thinks abortion is so cool or so fun.
[02:24:56.483 --> 02:25:01.964]  Let's look at some six-pound babies that never got to go to school, never got to have friends, never got to be cool.
[02:25:03.444 --> 02:25:04.665]  Keep on rockin' in the free world.
[02:25:04.965 --> 02:25:05.505]  Yeah, roll it!
[02:25:05.665 --> 02:25:05.945]  Roll it!
[02:25:06.665 --> 02:25:07.466]  Roll it for TV viewers!
[02:25:07.766 --> 02:25:08.526]  Let's look at it!
[02:25:08.826 --> 02:25:09.486]  Let's see it!
[02:25:09.806 --> 02:25:10.486]  Let's know it!
[02:25:10.706 --> 02:25:12.547]  Let's see what you've signed on to!
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:19.182]  Oh, the whole LGBT, you're so bullied against, everybody's so against you.
[02:25:19.963 --> 02:25:40.553]  You have the highest rates of education, highest rates of pay, highest rates of everything, and you're bitching and complaining that in your narcissistic, nihilistic, drug-fueled lifestyle, that somehow, if some of us just want to go fishing, or eat a plate of enchiladas, or drink a cold beer,
[02:25:41.854 --> 02:25:43.715]  And we don't want to shove gerbils up our ass.
[02:25:44.435 --> 02:25:47.837]  Because we don't want to do that, we're the bad guys.
[02:25:49.638 --> 02:25:50.278]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:50.398 --> 02:25:51.779]  I'm not even against Lemmy Winks.
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:55.661]  But you saw what happened to Lemmy Winks.
[02:25:55.681 --> 02:25:57.502]  It was a brave adventure.
[02:25:58.503 --> 02:26:01.504]  The bravest adventure on the road to Mordor.
[02:26:02.204 --> 02:26:03.685]  So we can talk about this all day.
[02:26:03.725 --> 02:26:05.026]  I'm not looking at what's on screen.
[02:26:05.446 --> 02:26:06.787]  But this is the true dark side.
[02:26:06.807 --> 02:26:07.387]  I'm going to break.
[02:26:09.008 --> 02:26:10.989]  You've got this commitment from me, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:13.917]  You've got this commitment from me a trillion percent.
[02:26:14.177 --> 02:26:15.958]  I won't compromise on the Second Amendment.
[02:26:16.398 --> 02:26:18.359]  I won't compromise on national sovereignty.
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:20.521]  I won't compromise when it comes to the unborn.
[02:26:20.801 --> 02:26:22.482]  And it's not because I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[02:26:22.522 --> 02:26:24.543]  It's because my soul's on the line.
[02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.324]  And I'm not about to forfeit that for anybody.
[02:26:30.816 --> 02:26:40.929]  Without you supporting us, and I know you know this and I want to thank you, but without you supporting us and thanking your local AM and FM stations and tithing to them once a month or tithing to us.
[02:26:40.969 --> 02:26:41.890]  We're not tax exempt.
[02:26:42.090 --> 02:26:43.672]  We're an information warfare operation.
[02:26:43.692 --> 02:26:44.353]  It's pro-America.
[02:26:45.162 --> 02:26:54.635]  But the point is, if you just get your coffee, and you just get your toothpaste, and you just get things like fish oil that everybody should be taking for your brain and heart, whether you're an adult or a child, every day we have the best three brands out there.
[02:26:55.436 --> 02:26:57.920]  We've got the best turmeric, and I'm glad listeners get this.
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:00.603]  We have 95% curcuminoid in bodies.
[02:27:02.441 --> 02:27:03.622]  That no one else has.
[02:27:03.842 --> 02:27:05.723]  We go and pay the top company in the U.S.
[02:27:05.743 --> 02:27:10.426]  that owns the patents to create the concentrated curcuminoid that is off the charts.
[02:27:10.466 --> 02:27:17.611]  And people get this and are so blown away about their joints and pain they have and just everything and what it does for your blood.
[02:27:18.872 --> 02:27:26.797]  Point is, Infoworkstore.com, you have that commitment from us that any product we sell you, in fact, I never got to this today, maybe at the end of the show we'll play it.
[02:27:28.478 --> 02:27:32.061]  I just happened along a fan-made video about Prostagard.
[02:27:33.835 --> 02:27:39.241]  And he took it and he doesn't have the prostate swelling or the problems anymore.
[02:27:39.601 --> 02:27:42.404]  He's like, this is the best prostate guard I ever took.
[02:27:42.725 --> 02:27:43.686]  I've taken some other brands.
[02:27:43.706 --> 02:27:44.427]  They didn't work as well.
[02:27:45.047 --> 02:27:52.115]  Well, that's because they don't wild source and get the concentrated organic herbs like saw palmetto.
[02:27:52.736 --> 02:27:55.339]  But we've got a bunch of other stuff in there.
[02:27:56.673 --> 02:28:00.275]  And he's like, well, you know, some brands are only $20, but this is $29.95.
[02:28:01.756 --> 02:28:02.997]  Well, it's $24.95 right now.
[02:28:03.017 --> 02:28:07.720]  Yeah, sir, that's because it has 10 ingredients in it, all sourced to be the best.
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:13.083]  But obviously anyone that takes it, some brands are $50 and aren't even as good.
[02:28:14.404 --> 02:28:22.789]  We go out and we say, what is the most quality, concentrated, popular prostate brand you could put out?
[02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:26.271]  Like, like, like we know you're manufacturing for seven or eight people.
[02:28:27.942 --> 02:28:29.424]  What could you do to top all of them?
[02:28:29.625 --> 02:28:32.048]  Well, we do this, we do that, we do this, we do that.
[02:28:32.749 --> 02:28:35.092]  And we go around to all these manufacturers, and then that's what we bring.
[02:28:35.112 --> 02:28:36.414]  That's our Prostagard.
[02:28:37.015 --> 02:28:38.537]  That's when people go, my God, this works better than anything else.
[02:28:39.508 --> 02:28:40.848]  There's a lot of talk out there in the world.
[02:28:40.868 --> 02:28:41.288]  There's a lot of BS.
[02:29:07.113 --> 02:29:09.415]  But I think InfoWars has proven it's delivered.
[02:29:11.736 --> 02:29:18.901]  I know at a certain level, the big crime we've committed is simply asking, who is the devil?
[02:29:21.824 --> 02:29:28.508]  Satanists come from a perspective that they have all the answers, that they're God.
[02:29:29.209 --> 02:29:33.272]  They're incredibly arrogant, and they're incredibly predictable.
[02:29:35.114 --> 02:29:37.415]  Well, if I'm anything, I'm not a Satanist.
[02:29:38.595 --> 02:29:40.296]  But I've certainly dealt with them in my life.
[02:29:43.197 --> 02:29:48.540]  And if you look at how they try to control society and the planet, they're pathetic.
[02:29:50.361 --> 02:29:52.822]  But I'll tell you what's even more pathetic.
[02:29:55.363 --> 02:30:02.466]  Men and women who don't love corruption, who don't love evil, and who don't love
[02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:17.452]  Simply being one-dimensional cutouts are so meek that we never get involved in the cultural or political discussion.
[02:30:19.053 --> 02:30:19.993]  And that's where I am.
[02:30:20.473 --> 02:30:21.373]  Halfway into 2019.
[02:30:22.293 --> 02:30:23.453]  We're almost at 2020.
[02:30:23.773 --> 02:30:27.654]  This is not Buck Rogers.
[02:30:27.694 --> 02:30:28.894]  This is not science fiction.
[02:30:28.934 --> 02:30:30.715]  This is not theater.
[02:30:30.775 --> 02:30:31.895]  This is not entertainment.
[02:30:31.935 --> 02:30:32.495]  This is not
[02:30:34.338 --> 02:30:34.738]  Fiction.
[02:30:35.599 --> 02:30:36.780]  This is the real world.
[02:30:38.461 --> 02:30:43.144]  And so I just sit back, wanting to have a good future for myself and you as well.
[02:30:43.164 --> 02:30:48.288]  Because let's not lie, there's 7.5 billion people on this planet.
[02:30:48.828 --> 02:30:51.250]  There's about to be 10 billion in the next decade.
[02:30:52.791 --> 02:31:01.918]  And if you think that if we screw over a big portion of those people, that we're not going to get destroyed in a nuclear war,
[02:31:03.131 --> 02:31:05.833]  Well, you're smoking some serious dope.
[02:31:07.795 --> 02:31:24.628]  So, that's my bottom line, is that I don't have all the answers, but I don't have that sociopathic, satanic worldview of screw everybody around me, and I'm gonna get ahead when all you're doing is bringing down the society around you.
[02:31:27.210 --> 02:31:28.852]  You know, I support President Trump.
[02:31:30.051 --> 02:31:31.772]  Even though he's imperfect like anybody else.
[02:31:31.912 --> 02:31:36.395]  Because you're under so much attack when you support the President.
[02:31:37.395 --> 02:31:39.276]  Because that's the one thing you're told not to do.
[02:31:40.817 --> 02:31:42.778]  Doesn't mean Trump doesn't have major problems.
[02:31:42.858 --> 02:31:44.179]  So do I. So do you.
[02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:48.441]  But why is he that person you're not supposed to support?
[02:31:50.182 --> 02:31:51.423]  And why is info worse?
[02:31:54.465 --> 02:31:55.005]  From Apple.
[02:31:55.846 --> 02:31:56.366]  And Google.
[02:31:56.426 --> 02:31:57.006]  And Facebook.
[02:31:57.466 --> 02:31:58.127]  They all tell you.
[02:31:59.787 --> 02:32:03.609]  There's this one sight, this one person, that you can't talk about.
[02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:06.030]  Unless you disparage him.
[02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:08.131]  Unless you crap on him.
[02:32:08.171 --> 02:32:09.472]  Unless you say he's bad.
[02:32:10.153 --> 02:32:11.233]  They think you're a slave.
[02:32:12.274 --> 02:32:13.594]  They think you're in a cult.
[02:32:14.335 --> 02:32:16.456]  And they've proven everything I've said.
[02:32:17.617 --> 02:32:20.918]  And the fact that they would make that bet against you and your family.
[02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:25.601]  That they're telling you, shut your mouth.
[02:32:26.758 --> 02:32:28.579]  You don't talk good about this person.
[02:32:29.199 --> 02:32:30.560]  In fact, you talk bad about him.
[02:32:31.060 --> 02:32:33.521]  And then we'll promote you on our systems.
[02:32:34.601 --> 02:32:35.802]  That sounds like slavery to me.
[02:32:37.723 --> 02:32:41.004]  I could be Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan.
[02:32:41.124 --> 02:32:51.048]  And if somebody said, don't promote this, I would rebel against it.
[02:32:51.128 --> 02:32:55.630]  But all I'm promoting is Jesus Christ, and freedom, and a pro-human future.
[02:32:57.637 --> 02:32:58.499]  So I ask you again.
[02:33:00.703 --> 02:33:01.845]  Who really is the devil?
[02:33:06.313 --> 02:33:08.938]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.672 --> 02:33:27.292]  The globalists are trying to collapse this country.
[02:33:28.893 --> 02:33:29.353]  Period.
[02:33:30.653 --> 02:33:32.434]  Massive amounts of drugs are being allowed in.
[02:33:32.734 --> 02:33:33.574]  Borders are treadily open.
[02:33:33.594 --> 02:33:34.555]  Diseases pouring in.
[02:33:35.215 --> 02:33:36.455]  The demoralization of the family.
[02:33:37.375 --> 02:33:38.516]  Killing babies after they're born.
[02:33:38.556 --> 02:33:38.996]  Crank it up.
[02:33:42.577 --> 02:33:46.518]  It's Neil Young, bringing us in.
[02:33:46.618 --> 02:33:48.058]  There's a lady in the night.
[02:33:48.619 --> 02:33:49.859]  She's got a baby in her arms.
[02:34:19.196 --> 02:34:20.677]  That's liberal to kill those babies.
[02:34:21.498 --> 02:34:24.260]  Because the left believes they get more money and power when they kill babies.
[02:34:25.741 --> 02:34:27.743]  They say they're the moral hierarchy, they're the bosses.
[02:34:29.045 --> 02:34:33.809]  All right, we've launched a lot of contests over the years, and it's not about the $5,000 prize.
[02:34:33.849 --> 02:34:37.193]  That just makes it fun to recognize who everybody thinks did the best video.
[02:34:38.554 --> 02:34:40.556]  And we've gotten 15 or so really good entries.
[02:34:40.576 --> 02:34:41.877]  We're going to play some of them right now.
[02:34:41.917 --> 02:34:43.398]  There's four or five days left in this.
[02:34:44.239 --> 02:34:49.964]  You go out and you just put out different posters about Alex Jones or about InfoWars or about free speech.
[02:34:50.785 --> 02:34:54.729]  And then you try to get local news to cover it and freak out over your speech.
[02:34:56.488 --> 02:34:59.371]  America leads charge against death of the West.
[02:34:59.411 --> 02:35:02.054]  It's the latest article with the latest entries.
[02:35:02.095 --> 02:35:08.282]  Free speech poster challenge brings fight for Western civilization to your neighborhood.
[02:35:10.204 --> 02:35:11.365]  So the latest entries are up there.
[02:35:11.385 --> 02:35:13.367]  We're going to play a few of these clips.
[02:35:15.499 --> 02:35:18.020]  And then Dr. Nick Baggage takes over in the fourth hour.
[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:20.340]  But just look at some of the new articles breaking.
[02:35:20.821 --> 02:35:32.904]  Passing on Sleeping Giant's founder, the guy that runs all these censorship brigades, continues to harass companies to block ad dollars to conservatives while he represents the same companies in his day job.
[02:35:33.344 --> 02:35:33.744]  Wow!
[02:35:34.244 --> 02:35:34.985]  Talk about evil.
[02:35:35.525 --> 02:35:36.065]  And U.S.
[02:35:36.105 --> 02:35:42.967]  government welcomes back two more ISIS brides and they're spawned back in to the United States.
[02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:46.111]  They'll probably be working at the NSA by the end of the week.
[02:35:47.172 --> 02:35:50.293]  And they've caught another ISIS fighter and they came to the Texas border.
[02:35:50.753 --> 02:35:52.374]  This is just crazy.
[02:35:53.075 --> 02:35:53.995]  And the crew did find it.
[02:35:54.755 --> 02:35:55.536]  Bloomberg and others.
[02:35:56.696 --> 02:35:59.498]  EU says they have jurisdiction globally over the Internet.
[02:35:59.898 --> 02:36:01.679]  Just an incredible time to be alive.
[02:36:02.079 --> 02:36:07.202]  But imagine how bad it'd be if we weren't on air and if you weren't out there spreading the word and taking action.
[02:36:07.742 --> 02:36:10.584]  Thank our lucky stars, all of us, that at least we care about what's going on.
[02:36:10.624 --> 02:36:11.004]  But wow!
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:15.203]  We are watching biblical things unfold right now.
[02:36:15.763 --> 02:36:16.624]  I'll be back, too.
[02:36:17.925 --> 02:36:19.626]  Don't forget this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:36:21.027 --> 02:36:29.734]  And I'm tempted to just open the phones up about Trump coming out and saying he may ban suppressors.
[02:36:30.655 --> 02:36:34.898]  He probably doesn't know that that is the fastest growing thing in firearms and very rarely used in a crime.
[02:36:35.859 --> 02:36:40.022]  And I just hate to have to go after Trump on that, but that is just mind-blowing.
[02:36:41.289 --> 02:36:41.770]  I do want to salute
[02:37:04.776 --> 02:37:10.559]  All of the folks that have entered the contest, again, see some of the top entries of the new posting at NewsWorks.com.
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:16.923]  But let's go ahead and go to Can We Save the West by Mr. Real News.
[02:37:16.943 --> 02:37:20.265]  Here it is.
[02:37:20.625 --> 02:37:24.908]  From the introduction of Pat Buchanan's masterpiece, The Death of the West.
[02:37:25.885 --> 02:37:26.826]  The West is dying.
[02:37:27.386 --> 02:37:32.230]  Its nations have ceased to reproduce, and their populations have stopped growing and begun to shrink.
[02:37:32.850 --> 02:37:40.336]  Not since the Black Death carried off a third of Europe in the 14th century has there been a graver threat to the survival of Western civilization.
[02:37:40.956 --> 02:37:45.319]  The New Hedonism seems unable to give people a reason to go on living.
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:48.141]  Its earliest fruits appear to be poisonous.
[02:37:48.942 --> 02:37:57.329]  Will this new, quote, liberating culture that our young have so enthusiastically embraced prove the deadliest carcinogen of them all?
[02:37:58.049 --> 02:38:03.653]  And if the West is in the grip of a culture of death, as the Pope contends, and the statistics seem to show,
[02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:09.832]  Is Western civilization about to follow Lenin's empire to the same and glorious end?
[02:38:10.333 --> 02:38:15.415]  These ideas have made Western elites apparently indifferent to the death of their civilization.
[02:38:16.075 --> 02:38:24.319]  They do not seem to care if the end of the West comes by depopulation, by a surrender of nationhood, or by drowning in waves of third world immigration.
[02:38:25.279 --> 02:38:26.760]  Now that all the Western empires are...
[02:38:29.602 --> 02:38:32.204]  And again, that's part of one of these great reports.
[02:38:32.224 --> 02:38:38.069]  We've got a whole bunch of these that are just really impressive and amazing that are up on the site.
[02:38:38.269 --> 02:38:41.372]  I was going to play all of that report, but we had a computer glitch.
[02:38:41.692 --> 02:38:47.076]  And you know, that's why it's just best that you go get these reports for yourself.
[02:38:47.116 --> 02:38:55.283]  But very, very impressed by how calm and focused this individual is, because I wish I was like that.
[02:38:57.008 --> 02:38:58.228]  I wish I was like that myself.
[02:38:59.009 --> 02:39:02.189]  And so just whenever, we'll just go ahead and play the next report.
[02:39:03.150 --> 02:39:07.971]  InfoWars poster contest, Al Gore Lied, by Thomas Siska from Austin, Texas.
[02:39:07.991 --> 02:39:08.871]  I think we have that one.
[02:39:09.531 --> 02:39:10.011]  So here it is.
[02:39:34.813 --> 02:39:36.194]  Downtown Austin, Texas.
[02:39:36.575 --> 02:39:38.577]  We have quite the poster board.
[02:39:38.717 --> 02:39:44.382]  It's a global warming poster featuring a very adorable polar bear.
[02:39:45.023 --> 02:39:46.064]  We're going to go have some fun.
[02:40:09.832 --> 02:40:14.094]  Al Gore, you lied about the polar bears.
[02:40:17.095 --> 02:40:20.916]  Al Gore, you lied about the polar bears.
[02:40:23.277 --> 02:40:24.698]  They're alright.
[02:40:25.658 --> 02:40:26.938]  They're doing just fine.
[02:40:27.679 --> 02:40:28.179]  Freezing.
[02:40:28.942 --> 02:40:32.144]  We're doing it.
[02:40:32.384 --> 02:40:34.746]  Thank you.
[02:40:55.024 --> 02:40:57.466]  I'd like a crispy taco please.
[02:40:57.947 --> 02:41:00.469]  So we're here at Tyson's Tacos in Austin, Texas.
[02:41:01.050 --> 02:41:03.352]  I just performed a song about the polar bears.
[02:41:03.992 --> 02:41:08.677]  Got a free taco for it and now you can see the posters in the background.
[02:41:41.921 --> 02:41:44.322]  Here at the Council of Foreign Relations.
[02:41:45.502 --> 02:41:46.322]  My man.
[02:41:47.223 --> 02:41:49.123]  Door guy.
[02:41:50.104 --> 02:41:54.245]  Lots of famous globalists coming in, coming out.
[02:41:55.986 --> 02:41:56.726]  Trying to kill me.
[02:41:57.886 --> 02:42:01.087]  But, really no good posting place.
[02:42:01.127 --> 02:42:02.068]  Except maybe right here.
[02:42:02.088 --> 02:42:04.229]  That's so dope.
[02:42:13.154 --> 02:42:15.416]  Would you mind taking a video of me real quick?
[02:42:17.417 --> 02:42:18.398]  I'm doing a contest.
[02:42:26.265 --> 02:42:31.969]  I don't want to make you late.
[02:42:32.009 --> 02:42:32.430]  Thank you.
[02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:34.051]  Have a nice day.
[02:42:35.532 --> 02:42:36.213]  Park Ave.
[02:42:36.233 --> 02:42:37.794]  68 CFR.
[02:42:40.848 --> 02:42:47.615]  Hopefully the Ghost of Rockefeller will distribute it, but a lot of people coming in, a lot of students.
[02:42:47.655 --> 02:42:48.456]  Hunter College.
[02:42:49.357 --> 02:42:50.278]  Park Ave, lovely day.
[02:42:50.298 --> 02:42:58.247]  How are you, Alex?
[02:42:58.267 --> 02:43:01.029]  I don't know, but I think it needs a...
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:07.981]  We are in a complete war!
[02:43:08.081 --> 02:43:10.122]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic!
[02:43:10.163 --> 02:43:10.983]  You fools!
[02:43:11.643 --> 02:43:12.684]  I want them shut down.
[02:43:12.744 --> 02:43:13.665]  I want them silenced.
[02:43:13.705 --> 02:43:14.485]  I want them muted.
[02:43:14.525 --> 02:43:16.387]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:43:17.367 --> 02:43:24.952]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[02:43:25.192 --> 02:43:28.595]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[02:43:29.435 --> 02:43:32.716]  Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Tech!
[02:43:33.136 --> 02:43:35.696]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[02:43:36.196 --> 02:43:40.217]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[02:43:40.677 --> 02:43:41.958]  I want them shut down.
[02:43:42.238 --> 02:43:45.858]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[02:43:46.198 --> 02:43:49.799]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[02:43:50.139 --> 02:43:51.179]  Everybody gets to speak.
[02:43:51.459 --> 02:43:52.380]  I'm a bad person!
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:53.120]  I question things!
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:53.700]  I'm evil!
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:54.160]  I don't...
[02:43:58.874 --> 02:44:00.335]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[02:44:24.355 --> 02:44:27.699]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe.
[02:44:27.739 --> 02:44:28.500]  You understand me?
[02:44:29.601 --> 02:44:30.162]  He's bluffing.
[02:44:30.202 --> 02:44:30.762]  Let's rush him.
[02:44:30.882 --> 02:44:30.983]  No!
[02:44:32.555 --> 02:44:34.896]  You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[02:44:35.437 --> 02:44:39.299]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[02:44:39.759 --> 02:44:44.482]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[02:44:44.542 --> 02:44:50.266]  We all know that right now, guns is a toad, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[02:44:50.326 --> 02:44:51.827]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud.
[02:44:51.847 --> 02:44:53.428]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[02:44:53.488 --> 02:44:54.728]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[02:44:55.829 --> 02:44:57.830]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[02:44:57.890 --> 02:45:00.912]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[02:45:00.972 --> 02:45:02.352]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[02:45:02.472 --> 02:45:09.516]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[02:45:09.676 --> 02:45:17.580]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever
[02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:22.644]  Hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[02:45:22.664 --> 02:45:23.945]  So what are you going to do?
[02:45:23.965 --> 02:45:24.406]  Outlaw everything?
[02:45:24.726 --> 02:45:25.467]  That ain't the answer.
[02:45:25.707 --> 02:45:27.348]  Just put some controls.
[02:45:28.189 --> 02:45:29.190]  Put some controls?
[02:45:29.450 --> 02:45:33.654]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[02:45:33.995 --> 02:45:35.176]  No, not so you can't.
[02:45:35.196 --> 02:45:36.817]  Just so the idiots can't get home.
[02:45:36.837 --> 02:45:38.919]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[02:45:39.059 --> 02:45:40.140]  Are you serious about that?
[02:45:40.741 --> 02:45:41.522]  Are you seriously?
[02:45:41.962 --> 02:45:42.863]  What good will that do?
[02:45:43.323 --> 02:45:44.543]  Oh my God.
[02:45:45.484 --> 02:45:46.964]  We had our Civil War.
[02:45:47.044 --> 02:45:55.786]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[02:45:56.446 --> 02:45:58.286]  So, I agree with that.
[02:45:58.366 --> 02:46:05.368]  I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[02:46:05.768 --> 02:46:06.888]  InfoWars.
[02:46:07.428 --> 02:46:10.189]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:46:24.011 --> 02:46:26.953]  We made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[02:46:27.093 --> 02:46:31.776]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[02:46:31.796 --> 02:46:37.980]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with Infowars.com.
[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:44.524]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify, I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[02:46:48.315 --> 02:46:50.197]  Get your order first.
[02:46:50.217 --> 02:46:53.359]  InfoWars4.com, InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:53.379 --> 02:46:55.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.861 --> 02:47:15.562]  Big Brother.
[02:47:15.982 --> 02:47:17.223]  Mainstream media.
[02:47:17.783 --> 02:47:18.764]  Government cover-ups.
[02:47:19.685 --> 02:47:21.146]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:47:21.366 --> 02:47:22.447]  Well, so does he.
[02:47:23.048 --> 02:47:28.112]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.192 --> 02:47:32.375]  I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:47:32.515 --> 02:47:36.859]  What can I do to get through to these people?
[02:47:36.959 --> 02:47:39.901]  I'm gonna do the stupid challenge!
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:54.435]  Sorry, I'm going to go out there and hit these all over the place.
[02:47:55.176 --> 02:47:55.957]  There it is!
[02:47:56.037 --> 02:47:57.499]  There it is!
[02:47:57.639 --> 02:47:57.780]  Ah!
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:58.220]  Ah!
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:47:59.041]  Ah!
[02:47:59.141 --> 02:47:59.181]  Ah!
[02:48:00.859 --> 02:48:01.500]  We're here, right?
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:02.921]  It's from Starbucks.
[02:48:03.282 --> 02:48:04.303]  It's right here.
[02:48:04.323 --> 02:48:05.324]  See, it's right here.
[02:48:05.344 --> 02:48:07.847]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[02:48:08.027 --> 02:48:10.190]  We gotta let them know.
[02:48:10.210 --> 02:48:10.510]  Here we go.
[02:48:10.530 --> 02:48:12.012]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[02:48:12.052 --> 02:48:13.493]  Let's do this, man.
[02:48:13.533 --> 02:48:15.275]  Before we get a ticket.
[02:48:15.335 --> 02:48:16.657]  Here comes the police.
[02:48:16.677 --> 02:48:16.937]  Police!
[02:48:17.077 --> 02:48:17.758]  Oh, it's coming!
[02:48:17.818 --> 02:48:18.399]  It's coming!
[02:48:18.759 --> 02:48:19.460]  Here it comes!
[02:48:22.632 --> 02:48:23.253]  Yeah!
[02:48:23.713 --> 02:48:25.514]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:48:25.694 --> 02:48:25.975]  Yeah!
[02:48:26.375 --> 02:48:26.875]  Yeah!
[02:48:26.935 --> 02:48:29.978]  Hey, I just had some good old Christian chicken!
[02:48:29.998 --> 02:48:31.459]  I'm about to go let them know!
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:33.881]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:48:39.042 --> 02:48:39.622]  Right here!
[02:48:39.642 --> 02:48:39.842]  Ah!
[02:48:39.862 --> 02:48:39.962]  Ah!
[02:48:39.982 --> 02:48:40.142]  Yeah!
[02:48:40.303 --> 02:48:43.524]  Alex Jones ain't nothing wrong!
[02:48:43.564 --> 02:48:46.405]  We're live at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Stadium!
[02:48:46.685 --> 02:48:48.846]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:48:48.866 --> 02:48:49.286]  Ah!
[02:48:50.026 --> 02:48:56.108]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:48:56.128 --> 02:48:58.229]  Ah!
[02:48:58.829 --> 02:49:03.631]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:49:03.651 --> 02:49:03.751]  Ah!
[02:49:03.811 --> 02:49:05.132]  Right here, right here.
[02:49:05.252 --> 02:49:07.853]  Everybody can see it.
[02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:11.630]  Let's go!
[02:49:12.511 --> 02:49:16.793]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong, Tampa Bay!
[02:49:18.394 --> 02:49:22.737]  Did you know vaccines have side effects that kill thousands a year?
[02:49:23.617 --> 02:49:34.103]  Vaccines are not tested for safety, and vaccine makers are not liable for the people they injure!
[02:49:34.123 --> 02:49:34.663]  Let's go!
[02:49:34.683 --> 02:49:35.704]  Infowars.com!
[02:49:40.791 --> 02:49:44.574]  Sir, did you know that vaccines have side effects that kill thousands a year?
[02:49:44.914 --> 02:49:46.335]  That vaccines are not safe.
[02:49:46.595 --> 02:49:48.276]  They're tested for safety and they're not.
[02:49:48.316 --> 02:49:49.317]  People think that.
[02:49:49.377 --> 02:49:53.139]  Vaccine makers are not liable for the people they injure.
[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:54.420]  Did you know that, sir?
[02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:56.181]  Infowars.com.
[02:49:56.221 --> 02:49:56.802]  Thank you, sir.
[02:49:56.842 --> 02:49:59.484]  We're going to put this right here for you.
[02:49:59.544 --> 02:50:02.906]  That way everybody can see it.
[02:50:02.926 --> 02:50:03.606]  Right there!
[02:50:03.827 --> 02:50:06.809]  Because I'm angry!
[02:50:08.151 --> 02:50:11.673]  I don't know where... We're here live reporting, Tampa, Florida.
[02:50:11.693 --> 02:50:15.176]  I don't know where this microphone came from, but Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[02:50:15.196 --> 02:50:16.277]  Let's go!
[02:50:16.457 --> 02:50:20.640]  We're here, Tampa, Florida.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:22.941]  I've got something to say.
[02:50:23.522 --> 02:50:25.003]  I'm angry.
[02:50:25.083 --> 02:50:28.885]  I've had enough of these people.
[02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:31.987]  They're a bunch of Christian murdering scrubs.
[02:50:32.908 --> 02:50:35.630]  Running giant disfractors, keeping babies alive.
[02:50:37.805 --> 02:50:38.726]  Sellin' their body parts.
[02:50:38.746 --> 02:50:40.447]  Hey, put it right here.
[02:50:40.487 --> 02:50:44.110]  We're in the corner of Delmaria and Lansing, I tell ya.
[02:50:44.170 --> 02:50:50.935]  Look at this, put it right here.
[02:50:50.955 --> 02:50:51.475]  Yeah!
[02:50:51.715 --> 02:50:52.036]  Yeah!
[02:50:52.456 --> 02:50:53.817]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:50:54.197 --> 02:50:56.339]  This is what we're here for, Infowars.com!
[02:50:56.739 --> 02:50:57.199]  Yeah!
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:59.541]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:51:14.500 --> 02:51:17.501]  Attention to all conservative comrades.
[02:51:17.621 --> 02:51:19.361]  Dude, now let me stop you right there.
[02:51:19.381 --> 02:51:21.382]  It's gonna be a hard pass.
[02:51:21.822 --> 02:51:29.024]  The deep state has foiled our genius plot to give barely any money to Facebook for advertising.
[02:51:29.544 --> 02:51:31.625]  Even though Obama said it was cool.
[02:51:32.935 --> 02:51:39.658]  And now they have banned our greatest ally, Alex Jones, for like the fifth time.
[02:51:40.138 --> 02:51:43.739]  We honestly didn't even know he was still on there.
[02:51:44.199 --> 02:51:45.000]  Greatest ally?
[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:46.600]  What are you talking about?
[02:51:47.381 --> 02:51:47.601]  Wait.
[02:51:48.561 --> 02:51:50.042]  Did Hillary Clinton put you up to this?
[02:51:50.482 --> 02:51:54.663]  You'd think we would prefer the Hillary Clinton and the Easy Uranium.
[02:51:55.144 --> 02:51:55.584]  But no.
[02:51:56.224 --> 02:51:58.365]  We prefer Zee Donald Trump for
[02:51:59.565 --> 02:52:01.025]  For some reason, I don't know.
[02:52:01.405 --> 02:52:04.486]  Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
[02:52:04.506 --> 02:52:14.129]  But more importantly, these big tech authoritarians, oh bully, they do not like the Donald Trump and they really don't like his supporters.
[02:52:14.569 --> 02:52:22.431]  It's so extreme now that they're even banning Jews after applying vague straw man labels to them.
[02:52:22.891 --> 02:52:26.333]  There are even banning 14-year-old womens for being too hilarious.
[02:52:42.984 --> 02:52:45.947]  Democrats are even going after people's banking just for their political ideology.
[02:52:55.802 --> 02:52:56.662]  What?
[02:52:57.282 --> 02:52:59.343]  Those are literal Nazi tactics.
[02:52:59.823 --> 02:53:03.784]  I was recently, I was banned on Tuesday from Instagram.
[02:53:04.144 --> 02:53:05.884]  I had a private account.
[02:53:05.985 --> 02:53:06.945]  They still banned me.
[02:53:07.765 --> 02:53:13.446]  Um, I also was banned from Chase WePay to sell tour tickets.
[02:53:13.826 --> 02:53:19.028]  Bro, great clips and all, but I understood about four of those words that you said.
[02:53:19.048 --> 02:53:22.889]  14-year-old wimans, why do you have an Italian accent?
[02:53:23.789 --> 02:53:23.949]  Wait.
[02:53:25.633 --> 02:53:26.379]  Is this entrapment?
[02:53:27.878 --> 02:53:29.159]  John Brennan, is that you?
[02:53:29.739 --> 02:53:40.345]  In this time of internet censorship, we must stride boldly forward to the next phase of our operation to... make America great again?
[02:53:40.365 --> 02:53:43.687]  It... it doesn't really make a lot of sense.
[02:53:44.367 --> 02:53:45.048]  Exactly.
[02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:48.570]  And take that Super Mario accent with you on the way out.
[02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.791]  Gong it.
[02:53:50.491 --> 02:53:55.174]  It is time to mobilize our forces and peacefully hit the streets?
[02:53:56.383 --> 02:54:00.205]  With our pro-liberty propaganda?
[02:54:00.666 --> 02:54:02.347]  Am I reading this correctly?
[02:54:03.167 --> 02:54:04.068]  Pro-liberty?
[02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:06.129]  No thanks?
[02:54:07.630 --> 02:54:09.191]  Maybe just a little bit of thanks?
[02:54:09.791 --> 02:54:10.472]  Wait, hold on.
[02:54:10.572 --> 02:54:10.952]  Shut up.
[02:54:10.992 --> 02:54:11.973]  I'm actually listening now.
[02:54:12.273 --> 02:54:19.077]  You're saying, put up posters in the real world since we're banned everywhere in the digital world.
[02:54:20.128 --> 02:54:27.853]  I mean, I am still waiting for those community guideline strikes to expire, so... Duh!
[02:54:28.133 --> 02:54:31.775]  The censorship is here, and who will rise up?
[02:54:32.015 --> 02:54:34.016]  It's actually quite easy.
[02:54:34.116 --> 02:54:47.785]  All you gotta do is print out some pre-made posters, take a video and you hang them up, and then just email a link to that video to contest at infowares.com by Monday, June 10th.
[02:54:48.525 --> 02:54:49.506]  Midnight Central Time.
[02:54:51.784 --> 02:54:53.145]  It's all very easy.
[02:54:53.565 --> 02:54:54.405]  Mamma mia!
[02:54:55.045 --> 02:54:59.827]  But most importantly, whatever you do, don't make it too good.
[02:54:59.907 --> 02:55:04.048]  Vladimir really needs that $5,000 first place prize.
[02:55:04.489 --> 02:55:06.709]  Or, tout bien, buy more costumes.
[02:55:07.390 --> 02:55:09.190]  Axes aren't cheap anymore, you know?
[02:55:09.490 --> 02:55:11.171]  But who will win $1,000 for second place?
[02:55:11.191 --> 02:55:12.091]  Or $500 for third?
[02:55:12.151 --> 02:55:13.052]  Will it be you?
[02:55:19.284 --> 02:55:23.050]  Conservative comrade, I was kind of talking to you.
[02:55:23.070 --> 02:55:23.731]  Hello?
[02:55:23.751 --> 02:55:27.016]  All right, now I'm all embarrassed.
[02:55:27.376 --> 02:55:29.740]  I'm not leaving though.
[02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:31.502]  No, I'll just sit here.
[02:55:36.249 --> 02:55:42.113]  All right, I am here for the Info Wars contest to hang a sign or poster with their website.
[02:55:42.773 --> 02:55:44.214]  I'm doing it a little bit different here.
[02:55:44.234 --> 02:55:45.155]  I'm in Flint, Michigan.
[02:55:45.535 --> 02:55:49.358]  What we have here is the block, or some people call it the rock.
[02:55:49.378 --> 02:55:51.099]  I've always called it the rock.
[02:55:52.039 --> 02:55:56.442]  And the city gave us permission a long time ago to paint this, you know, however we want.
[02:55:56.502 --> 02:55:58.403]  Obviously just keep obscene stuff off it.
[02:55:58.804 --> 02:56:02.566]  So there's no vandalism or any illegal activity or any worries like that here.
[02:56:02.726 --> 02:56:03.467]  It's 100% legal.
[02:56:04.827 --> 02:56:10.471]  I am right on Camperburg Road.
[02:56:11.572 --> 02:56:14.173]  I just got the initial coat of paint.
[02:56:14.193 --> 02:56:17.956]  I'm about to put the Anthem Awards poster, as they say on here.
[02:56:18.056 --> 02:56:22.839]  And they said, video yourself doing it, so this will be me videoing myself doing just that.
[02:56:59.730 --> 02:57:01.631]  I've been noticing a lot of signs going up around town.
[02:57:01.651 --> 02:57:02.011]  Unapproved signs.
[02:57:02.031 --> 02:57:04.233]  We here in Erstopia take these things very, very seriously.
[02:57:19.588 --> 02:57:22.970]  That's why I'm here as a representative of the Thought Police.
[02:57:23.671 --> 02:57:28.554]  To let you know what sort of thoughts you are and aren't allowed to have.
[02:57:29.215 --> 02:57:29.915]  Thought One.
[02:57:30.936 --> 02:57:31.516]  Oh boy.
[02:57:32.177 --> 02:57:36.180]  That's an instant one-week suspension.
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:38.761]  Oh, what's this about free speech?
[02:57:40.003 --> 02:57:41.045]  Not in Erstopia.
[02:57:41.425 --> 02:57:44.230]  That's one month in the brig.
[02:57:44.691 --> 02:57:50.322]  This right here, probably one of the best examples of what'll get you sent to the Gulag.
[02:57:53.464 --> 02:58:03.032]  Sometimes in life, your pipes just get a little clogged up, a little backed up, and you just can't get that clearance and that push that you need.
[02:58:03.633 --> 02:58:10.138]  But with Oxy-Powder from InfoWarsStore.com, that will no longer be an issue.
[02:58:10.518 --> 02:58:14.101]  But watch out, because this stuff is powerful.
[02:58:14.702 --> 02:58:20.947]  Oxy-Powder from InfoWarsStore.com clears those pipes that have been giving you all that backup.
[02:58:24.269 --> 02:58:26.970]  Sometimes grown-ups touch kids in ways they don't like.
[02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:30.071]  I was wrestling with my uncle, and it changed.
[02:58:30.371 --> 02:58:31.251]  It felt icky.
[02:58:31.491 --> 02:58:34.712]  When touching feels funny, it's hard to know what to do.
[02:58:35.432 --> 02:58:37.093]  He said I shouldn't tell anyone.
[02:58:37.113 --> 02:58:40.013]  If that ever happens to you, say no.
[02:58:40.473 --> 02:58:40.733]  No!
[02:58:41.014 --> 02:58:41.654]  Then go!
[02:58:41.974 --> 02:58:42.294]  No!
[02:58:42.794 --> 02:58:44.114]  And tell someone you trust.
[02:58:44.675 --> 02:58:45.015]  Tell!
[02:58:45.295 --> 02:58:46.095]  Say no!
[02:58:47.215 --> 02:58:47.775]  Then go!
[02:58:48.236 --> 02:58:49.096]  And tell!
[02:58:49.236 --> 02:58:52.037]  A message from the American Medical Association.
[02:58:52.057 --> 02:58:53.377]  I'll bet you're as bright as you're good-looking.
[02:58:54.591 --> 02:58:55.491]  I'll tell you what.
[02:58:55.511 --> 02:58:58.132]  What's your favorite subject?
[02:58:58.252 --> 02:58:58.672]  Journalism.
[02:58:58.692 --> 02:58:59.452]  Journalism?
[02:59:00.452 --> 02:59:00.672]  Whoa!
[02:59:00.712 --> 02:59:03.493]  Whoa, I better be more circumspect in my answers.
[02:59:03.533 --> 02:59:09.154]  Those guys back there.
[02:59:09.414 --> 02:59:12.314]  Go ahead, the next question.
[02:59:12.354 --> 02:59:14.175]  And by the way, that's one of the things that's a dangerous idea.
[02:59:14.475 --> 02:59:16.835]  You know, as these guys will tell you, I'm not always their favorite subject.
[02:59:17.055 --> 02:59:21.356]  But the truth of the matter is, the reason we are who we are is called a free press, continued as denizens.
[02:59:23.349 --> 02:59:26.011]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years, turmeric.
[02:59:26.051 --> 02:59:28.232]  It's one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[02:59:28.612 --> 02:59:33.935]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[02:59:34.175 --> 02:59:42.299]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the Boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[02:59:42.639 --> 02:59:47.562]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[02:59:48.122 --> 02:59:51.384]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com, please support this network.
[02:59:56.309 --> 03:00:08.912]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:09.072 --> 03:00:15.393]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.853 --> 03:00:19.474]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:00:23.226 --> 03:00:29.327]  And welcome to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, and I'm sitting in for Alex.
[03:00:29.808 --> 03:00:38.930]  You know, there's always a lot of news, and the guys cover it, Alex covers it really extraordinarily well.
[03:00:39.250 --> 03:00:48.272]  And, you know, the things I want to talk about a little bit today, maybe amplify some of this free speech discussion, and I'm going to kind of roll back
[03:00:49.259 --> 03:00:52.522]  Uh, and sort of reshape this a little bit.
[03:00:52.582 --> 03:01:02.411]  You know, when I first started doing this work years ago, the main emphasis for me was really military technology, how they were being applied.
[03:01:02.451 --> 03:01:03.532]  And then that led to, um,
[03:01:05.113 --> 03:01:12.858]  Privacy related technologies another look at all of that and a number of issues sort of came to the front now.
[03:01:12.878 --> 03:01:17.560]  This was the middle 1990s even the early 1990s.
[03:01:18.061 --> 03:01:30.808]  And so we started to see my colleagues and I trends that were taking us while really rapidly in a direction that would present probably the biggest challenges for freedom and Liberty.
[03:01:30.868 --> 03:01:32.709]  So I started writing and talking about
[03:01:33.509 --> 03:01:57.184]  The technocracy and the changes that were taking place within our culture and really the reshaping of culture, not based so much on what sprang from populations, but what media brought to us and how it sort of gently and then more radically began to shape the way people see the world.
[03:01:58.304 --> 03:02:13.517]  When you think about this, as things got more and more mechanized, more and more automated, it provided a lot of information, gave us access to a lot, but at the same time, every window that opened went both ways.
[03:02:14.198 --> 03:02:16.620]  And this is what got missed in the shuffle.
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:22.505]  As information opened in the world, it also opened in the direction of you personally.
[03:02:23.395 --> 03:02:35.325]  And so a lot of discussion about privacy and speech and the basic fundamentals, the building blocks of democratic republics like ours.
[03:02:36.706 --> 03:02:46.154]  When these start to be silenced by all the different methods, whether it's by political speech, you know, that was the first real wave.
[03:02:46.174 --> 03:02:47.996]  You know, what was not nice to say?
[03:02:48.717 --> 03:02:52.584]  Uh, and then what is criminally not nice to say what became hate speech.
[03:02:53.185 --> 03:02:55.148]  And that continues
[03:02:55.942 --> 03:02:58.504]  Um, to be amplified across the population.
[03:02:58.544 --> 03:03:03.247]  So you think about speech is the first sort of attack and takeaway.
[03:03:03.267 --> 03:03:07.490]  Because if you can't have open discussion, then it's easier to do the next thing.
[03:03:07.770 --> 03:03:10.812]  You know, take away your Second Amendment rights, as an example.
[03:03:11.253 --> 03:03:18.978]  If you can't talk about it, and the people that are talking about this in a way that is constitutional get silenced, then what
[03:03:19.924 --> 03:03:20.705]  What can you say?
[03:03:21.625 --> 03:03:25.568]  All the information in the world won't give you the opportunity to speak your truth.
[03:03:26.048 --> 03:03:38.437]  And so this is the attack on democracy that's actually taking us down a path that's much different than the one we're currently on.
[03:03:39.097 --> 03:03:45.281]  And again, we need to kind of rethink in the 21st century how technologies play against
[03:03:47.128 --> 03:03:49.529]  What we're seeing play out in the daily news.
[03:03:50.129 --> 03:03:52.610]  And the news feeds are interesting.
[03:03:52.630 --> 03:04:10.076]  You know, when you look at sort of how it's being shaped, CNN continuing to drop in the polls because people recognize it's becoming more of a contest of who's the best editorial showman, as opposed to delivering really useful information.
[03:04:10.879 --> 03:04:18.425]  Within the context of a public debate, invigorating the public debate, if I might say, with the facts rather than the opinion.
[03:04:18.985 --> 03:04:21.928]  And we see that across the media today.
[03:04:23.028 --> 03:04:24.650]  But it's not just about speech.
[03:04:24.730 --> 03:04:37.980]  It's also about privacy, because as we look at the news and as we select the data feeds that we're interested in, we also begin to reveal a profile of us ourselves individually, which is then utilized.
[03:04:39.020 --> 03:04:43.066]  By big tech and they're with their cooperation big government.
[03:04:43.607 --> 03:04:47.131]  We're going to talk more about this in the remaining segments of this hour.
[03:04:47.171 --> 03:04:49.855]  Take a look at info war store.com.

[03:06:14.088 --> 03:06:19.790]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:06:24.232 --> 03:06:34.636]  Welcome back on this Friday afternoon in most countries still a bit before noon here in Alaska, where I'm broadcasting today in the background.
[03:06:34.676 --> 03:06:37.757]  If you see it, that's one of the scenes from my part of the world.
[03:06:39.377 --> 03:06:40.958]  You know, when you think about
[03:06:41.553 --> 03:06:56.709]  The things that are happening right now, the idea of profiling, if you will, what we're trying to speaking to just before the break was this idea of gathering data, the two way sort of window and how the data is used and manipulated.
[03:06:56.729 --> 03:06:58.491]  You know, this is really
[03:07:00.003 --> 03:07:11.553]  The reshaping so that what you see in advertising in your social media, what you see coming at you literally is based on what you provide an information.
[03:07:11.593 --> 03:07:14.996]  And this is what fundamentally probably needs to be protected.
[03:07:15.056 --> 03:07:15.837]  Now, think back.
[03:07:15.857 --> 03:07:24.004]  If you go back to the 1990s, there was a program, Total Awareness, and it was a Pentagon program, and they wanted to really see the public.
[03:07:24.855 --> 03:07:38.167]  You know, every minute detail from facial recognition to your whole set of preferences in life, everything about you that you could gather was the sort of the picture and using the Internet to do it.
[03:07:38.747 --> 03:07:40.989]  Well, that kind of got shut down, sort of.
[03:07:41.149 --> 03:07:41.770]  But then what?
[03:07:41.930 --> 03:07:48.996]  It's called total information awareness for those that are looking at the thing on the video feed on this program.
[03:07:49.036 --> 03:07:51.458]  But here's the thing that about that that's important.
[03:07:52.086 --> 03:07:54.931]  is what they supposedly didn't do.
[03:07:55.792 --> 03:08:03.785]  It switched over to more of a terrorism look, but they collect all the data and then they made their deal with big tech.
[03:08:04.617 --> 03:08:09.059]  And Big Tech had the same kind of programming need, if you will.
[03:08:09.119 --> 03:08:25.847]  But their need was for the commercial extraction of the data so they could use it to go sell that data to other commercial enterprises that would sell you at a higher rate and be more successful in shaping, you know, sort of what you buy and your buying pattern by understanding a lot about you.
[03:08:26.383 --> 03:08:31.727]  Well, this got morphed into political manipulation as well.
[03:08:31.947 --> 03:08:47.097]  And in fact, all of this, Jim Roderick, late Jim Roderick, and I spoke about back in a book we wrote now almost 20 years ago called Earthrise and the Revolution, which still is pertinent in terms of where we are today.
[03:08:47.117 --> 03:08:51.220]  And it was more of a forecast based on 650 source documents.
[03:08:52.360 --> 03:08:55.863]  And that book is available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:08:56.683 --> 03:09:16.276]  Earth Rising the Revolution, it was really about looking at these systems, these technological systems, that on one hand look really good, they look attractive, they look interesting, but when you really dig down deep and look at the misapplication, which has not been adequately safeguarded,
[03:09:16.824 --> 03:09:32.436]  And this is the problem, is as our technologies have emerged and blossomed in the 21st century, and moving in to this next hundred years, the platform is changing.
[03:09:32.476 --> 03:09:35.538]  Now let me tell you what that means from a standpoint of technology.
[03:09:35.958 --> 03:09:40.582]  From the invention of the wheel to where we are at this moment, as we take this breath,
[03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:46.913]  In 10 months, all the technology that's been developed in that branch of time is going to double.
[03:09:47.954 --> 03:09:49.896]  And that's the window going forward.
[03:09:49.936 --> 03:09:51.997]  That's how fast everything is moving.
[03:09:52.518 --> 03:09:54.399]  Faster than anyone can keep up.
[03:09:54.459 --> 03:10:02.885]  And then the information gathered in those technologies is applied for commercial, political, and governmental reasons.
[03:10:03.366 --> 03:10:08.930]  If you don't think so, you've been sleeping under a rock.
[03:10:09.877 --> 03:10:21.663]  Now what's happening in all of this, as you think about it, is the safeguards for the very fundamental values that this program and others talk about are lost sort of in the shuffle.
[03:10:22.123 --> 03:10:27.205]  The right to privacy is no longer about your front door.
[03:10:27.225 --> 03:10:29.486]  And I've said this many times in this way.
[03:10:29.947 --> 03:10:32.908]  It is your digital doorway that has been kicked in.
[03:10:34.247 --> 03:10:42.151]  It's been kicked in by a technocracy, a union of big corporations as well as governments.
[03:10:42.632 --> 03:10:54.918]  And these big corporations, interestingly enough today, are the information technology, marketing technologies, the Googles, the Amazons, the Facebooks.
[03:10:55.839 --> 03:10:57.820]  And they are actually controlling
[03:10:58.380 --> 03:11:06.042]  And manipulating the political speech in favor of the political views of the owners of those companies as they're represented by their CEOs.
[03:11:06.742 --> 03:11:13.684]  And it's a big shift, you know, because a lot of economic power was traditionally held by the right.
[03:11:13.744 --> 03:11:22.826]  We never really thought much about big economic power held by the left, because traditionally Democrats in the United States were about working people and
[03:11:23.506 --> 03:11:28.207]  And Republicans were about big business, but that's all upside down anymore.
[03:11:28.227 --> 03:11:29.568]  It doesn't even apply anymore.
[03:11:29.588 --> 03:11:30.668]  It's all upside down.
[03:11:31.488 --> 03:11:34.669]  Value and dollars and income and billionaires don't matter.
[03:11:34.709 --> 03:11:38.630]  You're in both parties everywhere, furthering political interest.
[03:11:38.690 --> 03:11:49.572]  And it just makes it more obvious when you see it on the left, because the mechanism they happen to control aren't like big steel or oil or gas.
[03:11:49.672 --> 03:11:52.713]  It's the very communications that talk about all those things.
[03:11:53.664 --> 03:11:55.345]  And everything else under the sun.
[03:11:56.165 --> 03:12:01.587]  And then to restrict commercial transactions through PayPal and other organizations.
[03:12:03.287 --> 03:12:04.268]  Think about this.
[03:12:04.528 --> 03:12:05.428]  Is this the mark?
[03:12:06.608 --> 03:12:19.853]  Is this when buying and selling is regulated by those that conform to political speak and cultural speak evolved by think tanks of morons who just want to manipulate us?
[03:12:21.306 --> 03:12:25.607]  And I say spiritually moronic because intellectually they're high-powered horsepower.
[03:12:26.307 --> 03:12:27.468]  I don't think they're not.
[03:12:28.268 --> 03:12:32.109]  But spiritually they're bankrupt and they know it.
[03:12:32.969 --> 03:12:45.072]  Because the countermeasures is that awakening that's coming and is here now for those that have paid attention to what's going on in the world in the 21st century.
[03:12:45.872 --> 03:12:48.133]  And now is a very different time because as
[03:12:49.631 --> 03:13:01.064]  You look at what's being done materially, externally in the world, it's really a reflection internally of also what's happening within us.
[03:13:01.625 --> 03:13:07.432]  You know, usually when you think about these things, there's two extremes, both sides of the equation.
[03:13:07.592 --> 03:13:08.333]  You know, there's the
[03:13:10.121 --> 03:13:18.025]  A side of the equation that says, oh, people are just drones, taxpayers, consumers, whatever title they want to give you.
[03:13:18.045 --> 03:13:23.388]  And I want to say to everyone listening to this broadcast, you are not that.
[03:13:23.969 --> 03:13:25.529]  You can reflect some of those things.
[03:13:25.569 --> 03:13:35.755]  Certainly you're a consumer at times, you're a taxpayer at times, you're a parent at times, you're a friend at times, you're all those things at times, but you are
[03:13:37.265 --> 03:13:39.146]  A human being, fundamentally.
[03:13:39.266 --> 03:13:42.508]  And those things that I just referenced are things that you do.
[03:13:43.509 --> 03:13:46.971]  You are a parent sometimes, you are a friend sometimes, you're a taxpayer sometimes.
[03:13:47.431 --> 03:13:55.256]  These things that you do are wrapped around your experiential living in the world that we experience on a day-to-day basis.
[03:13:55.756 --> 03:13:57.637]  That's our physical reality.
[03:13:57.757 --> 03:14:00.619]  But our internal reality, our value system,
[03:14:01.573 --> 03:14:08.317]  that decide how we behave and act in the world is really the corpus of our awareness, right?
[03:14:08.737 --> 03:14:19.703]  This is what motivates us, which moves us through the world in a way that creates a pause to change something that robotics and AI will never have.
[03:14:20.183 --> 03:14:22.104]  But having said that,
[03:14:22.757 --> 03:14:31.579]  The advances in these technologies, and what's coming, and their ability to rationally reason will be indisputable.
[03:14:31.999 --> 03:14:39.580]  To take huge, massive data sets and interpret those data sets, these machines will be able to do.
[03:14:39.620 --> 03:14:43.001]  But I have news for everyone listening.
[03:14:43.321 --> 03:14:49.442]  The quantum computing that they're aspiring to, and quantum computing, just let me give you a quick illustration.
[03:14:50.346 --> 03:15:05.814]  20 years ago the case was you could put everybody on a hand calculator for 60 hours and do what you could do with the whole population of the planet for 60 hours running hand calculations every few seconds.
[03:15:06.834 --> 03:15:10.656]  And a supercomputer of today would do that in a second.
[03:15:11.637 --> 03:15:12.877]  A quantum computer.
[03:15:13.298 --> 03:15:14.058]  Now imagine that.
[03:15:14.668 --> 03:15:21.491]  All those people running those hand calculators all that time for 60 hours, the whole planet, everybody.
[03:15:22.372 --> 03:15:25.033]  And that's what a supercomputer today does in a second.
[03:15:25.613 --> 03:15:29.895]  Think about that supercomputer that I just described running for a trillion years.
[03:15:31.015 --> 03:15:35.097]  A quantum computer will do what that supercomputer does in a trillion years.
[03:15:35.898 --> 03:15:36.538]  It will do it
[03:15:37.617 --> 03:15:38.257]  Most of you
[03:16:16.638 --> 03:16:25.424]  There's a little CIA Vanderbilt, the little golden boy Anderson Cooper making Emperor Palpatine faces, while Judge Jeanine Pirro talks about the crime syndicate.
[03:16:25.544 --> 03:16:31.728]  I've talked a lot about this over the years, that when you get around globalists and their minions, they act like demon-possessed people.
[03:16:32.968 --> 03:16:37.031]  And hundreds of times on air, I've imitated the type of faces they make.
[03:16:37.591 --> 03:16:41.674]  But more and more, when Strzok or Pelosi or Michael
[03:16:45.100 --> 03:16:46.461]  By something they don't like.
[03:16:46.741 --> 03:16:48.923]  They're not scripting this behind closed doors.
[03:16:48.963 --> 03:16:52.586]  This isn't some new thing they've come up with, like they do in most cases.
[03:16:53.267 --> 03:16:59.372]  The face they make, I've made many times on air, and people have always screenshotted it and said, look, Jones looks crazy.
[03:16:59.752 --> 03:17:02.054]  But I have had politicians flashing at me.
[03:17:02.074 --> 03:17:04.957]  I've been around globalists with no cameras or on, and this is what they do.
[03:17:05.237 --> 03:17:06.258]  This is the faces they make.
[03:17:11.282 --> 03:17:13.204]  Now, how many hundreds of times have I told you they do this?
[03:17:17.199 --> 03:17:19.962]  So more and more, they're manifesting who they are.
[03:17:20.142 --> 03:17:29.353]  So Judge Dean Pirro was on television talking about how the walls are really closing in on these crooks, and Cooper, when he does his demon targeting, does the exact same, I call it the snaky dance.
[03:17:30.334 --> 03:17:30.694]  And they...
[03:17:32.581 --> 03:17:35.385]  There's 20 years of me making these faces on TV and telling you they do it.
[03:17:35.505 --> 03:17:40.111]  And as they go more insane, they're going to manifest and show you their real spirit.
[03:17:40.672 --> 03:17:41.854]  And again, this is real.
[03:17:41.974 --> 03:17:45.198]  How do they all make the same face not being coached?
[03:17:45.278 --> 03:17:47.281]  They make a snake move and they go,
[03:17:48.484 --> 03:17:52.387]  Grab your popcorn, junior mints, or whatever makes you happy.
[03:17:52.848 --> 03:17:55.510]  The real show is about to begin.
[03:17:55.530 --> 03:17:59.013]  This will be true reality TV.
[03:17:59.653 --> 03:18:06.859]  No scripts, no rehearsals, just a gang of criminals pointing fingers at each other to save their own hides.
[03:18:07.359 --> 03:18:11.343]  A version of true crime and the reality show Survivor.
[03:18:13.610 --> 03:18:14.490]  Who wrote that?
[03:18:14.890 --> 03:18:18.572]  And I'm telling you, I've always explained, the whole wimpy, quiet act is an act.
[03:18:18.692 --> 03:18:30.956]  Reportedly, from folks I've interviewed that know them well, behind closed doors and at their events, Vanderbilt's, Rothschild's, Rockefeller's, spirit-cooking type stuff, in private, they all walk around like this together, going,
[03:18:37.181 --> 03:18:39.743]  Now, I'm only imitating what it's like to be demon-possessed.
[03:18:39.763 --> 03:18:53.097]  Hillary, and other people that have guarded her, everybody I know that's guarded her, from Blackwater to the Army to the CIA, says that Hillary goes into trances and actually will just be on a helicopter in a car and just go...
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:56.862]  And we'll just blink out.
[03:18:57.142 --> 03:19:02.208]  But she'll also start going... And we'll beat the ground and flop around.
[03:19:05.331 --> 03:19:06.332]  And she hates dogs.
[03:19:06.392 --> 03:19:07.934]  Bring a dog around her to sniff her bombs.
[03:19:08.034 --> 03:19:09.055]  She'll go, I hate that...
[03:19:10.676 --> 03:19:12.457]  I'll have your ass fired!
[03:19:12.737 --> 03:19:15.698]  You don't look at me in the eyes, you scum!
[03:19:15.938 --> 03:19:17.639]  You military scum!
[03:19:17.659 --> 03:19:18.719]  This has been written about.
[03:19:18.979 --> 03:19:25.281]  And she'll start throwing things like... And again, you think I'm joking, folks.
[03:19:25.421 --> 03:19:26.281]  I'm not kidding.
[03:19:26.441 --> 03:19:28.302]  Well, hell, you've seen the abortion demonstrations.
[03:19:28.442 --> 03:19:30.903]  These people show up and go, we kill our children, Satan!
[03:19:31.163 --> 03:19:31.663]  So...
[03:19:44.571 --> 03:19:46.412]  We're facing some very insane people.
[03:20:05.743 --> 03:20:08.405]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.502 --> 03:20:31.165]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind, with Nick Begich.
[03:20:35.207 --> 03:20:37.828]  And welcome back to this fourth hour.
[03:20:37.848 --> 03:20:42.871]  I'm coming to you from, last again, from my home in Anchorage.
[03:20:42.931 --> 03:20:52.275]  And just before the break, I was talking about this kind of way of maybe reshaping some of the debate, all right?
[03:20:53.956 --> 03:21:05.848]  We talk about information, we talk about sort of what the technocracy is doing and its attack on our basic humanity, you know, on who we are, because of the way it looks at us.
[03:21:06.288 --> 03:21:08.150]  It makes us into a commodity.
[03:21:08.370 --> 03:21:16.558]  Think about, you know, 7 to 9 billion people around the planet over the next 10 years just being some expendable commodity.
[03:21:17.981 --> 03:21:30.567]  This is how much of the population of the world is looked at by many at the very top of the pile of greed, corruption and craziness.
[03:21:31.807 --> 03:21:35.009]  And not to say that accumulating wealth is bad.
[03:21:35.189 --> 03:21:36.409]  I believe it's a good thing.
[03:21:36.449 --> 03:21:39.171]  You know, it's a way that we sort of keep score on the planet.
[03:21:39.251 --> 03:21:39.671]  We do it
[03:21:40.231 --> 03:21:43.533]  Responsibly, and most of us make our living in a decent way.
[03:21:43.553 --> 03:22:00.364]  And I think even these big tech companies, you know, great innovation, great ideas, great teams, great people, but misapplication of technology by failing to underlie that experience, again, on a platform of values.
[03:22:00.564 --> 03:22:01.885]  This is what's been missing.
[03:22:02.843 --> 03:22:09.285]  And yet everyone's looking for it, so when you see the slightest indication of it, people tend to gravitate that way.
[03:22:09.346 --> 03:22:16.248]  That's why certain speakers are jumping out of the woodwork, because they're speaking a truth that resonates with people.
[03:22:16.288 --> 03:22:27.252]  Because everyone, internally, as a human being, when you hear it, it vibrates, it resonates, it sounds a note in you that is unavoidable.
[03:22:27.836 --> 03:22:39.221]  That you can't mistake for something else is that intuitive touch of grace that tells you what is and what is not in your personal interior life.
[03:22:39.561 --> 03:22:51.387]  Now if you shut that down, you don't listen to it, you just keep turning it off, turning it off, it will dull and it will atrophy and you'll become a sociopath, a narcissist, and a sociopath.
[03:22:52.026 --> 03:23:03.154]  Which, incidentally, there's like one or two in five at the very top of CEOs and organizations, including government, that are that.
[03:23:04.576 --> 03:23:11.120]  Because that's what allows them to cut the throat of anyone in their way and jump to the top.
[03:23:11.521 --> 03:23:13.202]  Many of them are sociopaths.
[03:23:13.522 --> 03:23:19.707]  Inability to recognize and display natural, normal human emotions, because they've turned all that off.
[03:23:20.188 --> 03:23:26.193]  Because the feeling side of us is what's stimulated often by our intuitive internal conversation.
[03:23:26.613 --> 03:23:29.716]  And then what we do with that decides how we deal with the world.
[03:23:29.896 --> 03:23:35.801]  Do we deal with the world in anxiety and fear and run around worrying about the sky falling?
[03:23:35.961 --> 03:23:39.064]  Or do we engage life in a more direct,
[03:23:41.610 --> 03:24:02.056]  Where we engage what we see in the world from a platform of recognition of our basic innate values as living souls, as created human beings, as a spirit occupying a carrier or a body or whatever you want to refer to this thing.
[03:24:02.580 --> 03:24:02.981]  I think so.
[03:24:17.924 --> 03:24:21.785]  You have deep responsibility for what you say and how the information is delivered.
[03:24:22.145 --> 03:24:31.648]  You know, some people are stimulated by all different kinds of conversation to get thinking engaged again because thinking is the name of the game.
[03:24:32.108 --> 03:24:34.009]  And so much of the social media
[03:24:34.978 --> 03:24:39.100]  And the mainstream media is not about engaging your intellect.
[03:24:39.641 --> 03:24:55.869]  It's about moving the herd, pushing your opinion, pushing who you are, shaping what you think, determining how to best do that based on the information you voluntarily give up every time you engage with an electronic interface into the world.
[03:24:56.707 --> 03:25:06.034]  And anything else you do, because even the fundamental stuff like mail, you know, every return address and address sent is kept by the Postal Service.
[03:25:06.595 --> 03:25:12.379]  And all those linkages create, again, a matrix that describes a lot about us individually.
[03:25:12.419 --> 03:25:16.662]  And this is the ongoing collection of data.
[03:25:16.722 --> 03:25:18.523]  And what does the data mean?
[03:25:19.704 --> 03:25:22.707]  The data makes predictions.
[03:25:23.227 --> 03:25:25.909]  The more you have, the better your ability to predict.
[03:25:26.511 --> 03:25:29.553]  With 3,000 data points, which we all give up.
[03:25:29.573 --> 03:25:36.578]  If you're listening to this on any medium at all, I know that you've done that in probably the last month or six weeks even.
[03:25:37.839 --> 03:25:38.980]  3,000 contact points.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:49.167]  You have a profile of an individual that's so profound that someone who lives with you for 20 years could, it would take to be able to predict.
[03:25:49.247 --> 03:25:56.132]  But more importantly, the computer will predict what you will do at that point better than you yourself will.
[03:25:58.269 --> 03:25:59.709]  Based on just the raw data.
[03:25:59.729 --> 03:26:12.096]  So when you think about AI and computers gathering information, when we started our work, they were using data warehouses, and they were storing all this data, and everybody was saying, it's worthless, it doesn't mean anything.
[03:26:12.577 --> 03:26:17.139]  Before this segment began, we were talking about quantum computing and the power of that.
[03:26:17.699 --> 03:26:21.702]  And see, this allows you to sort all that data instantly.
[03:26:21.982 --> 03:26:22.282]  Poof!
[03:26:23.795 --> 03:26:25.116]  Just virtually instantly.
[03:26:25.156 --> 03:26:26.857]  I mean, with so little time involved.
[03:26:27.298 --> 03:26:35.504]  And then be able to apply the flow of information, the nudging, against each profile of each person individually.
[03:26:35.884 --> 03:26:38.546]  And be able to track them through the world.
[03:26:39.133 --> 03:26:46.677]  Because of facial recognition, voice recognition, these basic things that we report on 20 years ago that are now part of the mainstream.
[03:26:47.018 --> 03:26:50.320]  This is part of the Chinese model of social control.
[03:26:50.740 --> 03:26:53.641]  And this network and people listening to this network are well aware of it.
[03:26:53.782 --> 03:27:00.325]  Facial recognition, biometrics, applied to population control, and then your behavior monitoring.
[03:27:00.365 --> 03:27:08.330]  This is all based on data points from a culture, technologically, that's way different from what we're doing in the West.
[03:27:08.490 --> 03:27:13.454]  We even give more information in the West than they ever thought about giving up in China.
[03:27:13.874 --> 03:27:17.076]  The differences are overt about it, and here we're covert about it.
[03:27:17.316 --> 03:27:20.098]  It's the same thing, it's just happening a little differently.
[03:27:20.559 --> 03:27:21.299]  Now in the U.S.
[03:27:21.319 --> 03:27:33.868]  they say, oh, but we're not going to get that data without a warrant, and then you've got things like FISA courts where nobody even gets to hear about warrants, and false information is rolled up in front of judges and gets used to subpoena records, and then all that data
[03:27:35.273 --> 03:27:42.016]  You know, secret court, shutting down freedom of speech, big tech, holding our data warehouses hostage.
[03:27:42.376 --> 03:28:02.605]  This is your information, your digital doorway, and the technocracy has already kicked it in, and no one has said a word except these networks that represent an alternative view of the media, both from the far left and the far right, and sweeping all the way through the middle, these dialogues has happened.
[03:28:03.357 --> 03:28:28.429]  And have happened, continue to happen, and yet the mainstream continues to push us apart, to separate us, and to create a violent reaction and backlash that's not only unnecessary, it doesn't lend itself to this republic and the principles under which it was founded, which is about our divinity as human souls, our independence, our sovereignty,
[03:28:29.189 --> 03:28:35.451]  The system that has come against us is choking us and strangling this Democratic Republic.
[03:28:35.791 --> 03:28:38.491]  And this is not the only democracy being affected.
[03:28:38.551 --> 03:28:43.492]  That is why you're seeing the backlash around the world from those who are still awake.
[03:28:43.952 --> 03:28:46.393]  And the awakening is happening now.
[03:28:46.913 --> 03:28:48.253]  You're the tip of the sphere.
[03:28:48.773 --> 03:28:49.934]  We're doing this together.
[03:28:50.714 --> 03:28:52.974]  Take a look at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:28:53.194 --> 03:28:55.295]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:29:06.876 --> 03:29:12.520]  I'm here in my parents' kitchen because my house flooded with torrential rains this week.
[03:29:13.320 --> 03:29:16.062]  So the flooded part of the house, they're having to fix that, so I've been staying over here.
[03:29:17.343 --> 03:29:23.967]  And I looked in my parents' cupboard and found that they were stocked up on some of the InfoWars Life products.
[03:29:23.987 --> 03:29:24.768]  And I thought, wait a minute.
[03:29:25.428 --> 03:29:31.372]  I've been thinking about coming over to their house, because their kitchen's nicer than mine, and shooting a video about how amazing these products are.
[03:29:31.912 --> 03:29:35.039]  So I called Drew, one of our great camera people over at InfoWars this morning.
[03:29:35.640 --> 03:29:40.831]  I said, hey, why don't you meet me over here and I'm going to shoot a video I've been meaning to do for probably a year.
[03:29:40.931 --> 03:29:42.153]  So I'm like, I've got everything right here.
[03:29:43.422 --> 03:29:44.963]  It's time to show you what I personally do.
[03:29:45.443 --> 03:29:46.563]  Now, I want to be clear.
[03:29:47.424 --> 03:29:56.728]  When I remember to take the supplements religiously, I lose weight, I'm healthy, my skin gets great, I have better stamina, libido, energy.
[03:29:57.409 --> 03:29:58.429]  I've never been a supplements guy.
[03:29:58.449 --> 03:30:02.751]  A lot of my big sponsors were supplement people, and I thought, well, why don't I try these then?
[03:30:03.091 --> 03:30:04.112]  And it turned out they were really good.
[03:30:04.772 --> 03:30:07.653]  So we came out, as you know, six years ago with our own line of supplements.
[03:30:07.673 --> 03:30:09.054]  We've been expanding it ever since.
[03:30:09.074 --> 03:30:10.435]  And what we do is,
[03:30:11.335 --> 03:30:18.057]  Set out to already find what's the highest rated, already find what's the cleanest, what's the best, and then make it better, and then cut the price.
[03:30:18.637 --> 03:30:20.217]  And that's what we've done with these products.
[03:30:20.497 --> 03:30:30.440]  And that's why InfoWars Live products are so highly rated by third-party sites, that's why they're so popular with you, and it's also great because it funds our political operations, trying to stop the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[03:30:33.247 --> 03:30:36.548]  I always start taking the supplements and then I forget to take them.
[03:30:36.788 --> 03:30:42.289]  I either run out or I just get busy and then all of a sudden I'm not taking DNA Force.
[03:30:42.749 --> 03:30:44.470]  All of a sudden I'm not taking X2.
[03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:45.870]  I'm not taking Secret 12.
[03:30:45.910 --> 03:30:58.653]  That's why it's important for everybody out there that already knows they got great results with these high quality products and InfoWars Life or other supplements you've been taking to remember how good they were for you and your family and to get back into it.
[03:30:59.213 --> 03:31:06.623]  So today I just wanted to encourage everybody that's gotten great results with these products to just remember that because I need that reminder as well.
[03:31:07.144 --> 03:31:13.412]  One of the biggest things is I tend to go to the warehouse and get some of the products out for myself and then those run out and I forget.
[03:31:13.973 --> 03:31:15.795]  So now what I do, what my parents do,
[03:31:16.796 --> 03:31:31.781]  And other people I know is they just put it on auto ship and then fullwarslive.com get an additional 10% off and then you don't forget each month or every two months how much you want to have it shipped to you to get the product, support the show, and of course also get 10% off.
[03:31:32.321 --> 03:31:39.023]  Now some of the things I do is I don't really like soft drinks because I got so much sugar in them and I already have a problem with sweets sometimes.
[03:31:39.803 --> 03:31:41.464]  So I really like soft drinks.
[03:31:41.484 --> 03:31:42.224]  What I'm trying to say is
[03:31:43.084 --> 03:31:44.365]  I don't like the effects they have on me.
[03:31:44.945 --> 03:31:51.469]  So what I do is take something like a Perrier, lime or non-flavored, and I put it into a nice glass.
[03:31:53.390 --> 03:31:56.752]  And then I take the Ultra 12
[03:31:58.820 --> 03:32:03.584]  And put in a whole dropper, and then I stir it up, and the flavor is incredible.
[03:32:04.064 --> 03:32:18.955]  So again, take your favorite sparkling water that doesn't have any calories in it, either flavored or unflavored, it all goes great with the flavor of natural vitamin B12 that has a sweet taste without any sugar or additives.
[03:32:18.995 --> 03:32:24.899]  You've got to experience Ultra 12 for yourself, you've got to experience X2 as well, and of course X3.
[03:32:24.999 --> 03:32:26.721]  That's triiodine.
[03:32:27.421 --> 03:32:28.722]  Different strokes for different folks.
[03:32:29.142 --> 03:32:34.325]  Bottom line, these are all incredible products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[03:32:34.745 --> 03:32:42.610]  As I've said over and over again, it then funds an organization dedicated to exposing the globalists and their operations.
[03:32:42.670 --> 03:32:44.111]  That's why I thank you all for your support.
[03:32:44.131 --> 03:32:46.772]  I want to encourage you, if you haven't tried these products, to try them.
[03:32:46.792 --> 03:32:48.854]  And if you have tried them and, again, forgot,
[03:32:49.634 --> 03:32:51.356]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:22.538 --> 03:33:29.081]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:33:29.721 --> 03:33:34.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.303 --> 03:33:44.286]  And welcome back, and I want to thank everyone that supports this network and supports us on the production team.
[03:33:44.346 --> 03:33:51.569]  I got Connor and Kyle and Daria always helping me out when we're on live, and I really appreciate
[03:33:52.269 --> 03:33:53.190]  Um, them a lot.
[03:33:53.270 --> 03:33:55.492]  And I appreciate everyone that listens.
[03:33:55.512 --> 03:33:59.536]  You know, pass these videos on, you know, and remember the contest that's going on.
[03:33:59.576 --> 03:34:03.059]  I thought that was pretty cool before this segment began.
[03:34:03.079 --> 03:34:05.602]  $5,000, you know, putting up signs.
[03:34:06.462 --> 03:34:07.003]  First prize.
[03:34:07.043 --> 03:34:08.144]  I think that's a cool thing.
[03:34:08.384 --> 03:34:13.149]  And that gets the InfoWars out and bypasses the technocracy.
[03:34:13.189 --> 03:34:15.150]  So I think that's a great idea.
[03:34:15.210 --> 03:34:15.451]  You know,
[03:34:16.792 --> 03:34:20.795]  I'm like a paper guy and I've been trying to get better about it, but I just can't.
[03:34:20.895 --> 03:34:26.700]  You know, I really, I keep books and they're not in digital form, they're actually printed.
[03:34:27.020 --> 03:34:33.485]  And I keep paper because I think about the digital world and how easy information can come and go and be restricted.
[03:34:33.865 --> 03:34:36.507]  And we're just seeing the very beginning of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:34:36.547 --> 03:34:38.229]  And those who haven't read the book 1984, well,
[03:34:40.259 --> 03:34:40.820]  You're in it.
[03:34:41.561 --> 03:34:48.309]  You all have leading roles, although we don't generally think about it, except 1984 is primitive.
[03:34:48.689 --> 03:34:53.054]  I mean, it's like the primitive version of what we're doing and what's happening to us today.
[03:34:53.615 --> 03:34:58.301]  And as actors in the play of reshaping the way we think,
[03:35:00.265 --> 03:35:09.654]  The InfoWars, you see, the very name InfoWars implies from the very beginning, going back 23, 24 years now with Alex.
[03:35:10.595 --> 03:35:13.918]  For me, my statement, my slogan, you know, at the end of
[03:35:14.557 --> 03:35:33.872]  My company name was changing the way we see the world because that's what I saw going on and and I wanted to make sure we at least kept some focus that was multi-generational and uh you know this is my brother Tom's thesis in his master's thesis was on multi-generational history one of the degrees he got along the way was one in history and
[03:35:34.552 --> 03:35:40.276]  You know, he has a very different perspective on sort of what history brought us to and how we interpret it.
[03:35:41.016 --> 03:35:47.821]  And in my family, we have real liberals, Tom, that's on that end, and real conservatives.
[03:35:47.881 --> 03:35:57.187]  And my son and I fit on that end, my oldest son and I. And, you know, when we get into these discussions, what we're looking for is not necessarily the middle ground.
[03:35:57.247 --> 03:35:59.388]  There's my brother on the screen, if you're looking.
[03:36:00.369 --> 03:36:05.592]  And he's a state senator, actually, representing downtown Anchoragetown and our state capitol.
[03:36:06.133 --> 03:36:16.860]  And, you know, when you look at the politics, the differences, this brings an invigorated conversation to my family that's really lively.
[03:36:16.940 --> 03:36:22.784]  It's not devoid of emotions by any stretch of the imagination, but a value system underlies that debate.
[03:36:23.391 --> 03:36:28.712]  And it's based on consideration, respect and accountability and love fundamentally.
[03:36:29.272 --> 03:36:39.234]  And the right, the fundamental right to express ourselves respectfully, recognizing fundamentally, and we express differently, the divinity in each other.
[03:36:40.114 --> 03:36:51.916]  That level of respect that we listen carefully, we engage the debate and hopefully, and one of the kind of working rules in my family is if you go to the fight, you know, in terms of a debate,
[03:36:52.665 --> 03:37:00.734]  You need to come armed with a set of solutions and make that the focus of your conversation because therein lies the opportunity.
[03:37:01.254 --> 03:37:04.598]  We all recognize problems just come at the solutions differently.
[03:37:04.858 --> 03:37:06.820]  So we fight over the problem existing.
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:07.781]  Well, that's kind of crazy.
[03:37:07.821 --> 03:37:09.243]  We all know these problems exist.
[03:37:09.723 --> 03:37:14.689]  So let that go get into the discussion about what are the solution sets for getting the
[03:37:15.367 --> 03:37:18.988]  Propaganda, one-liners, they get us all emotionally charged up.
[03:37:19.388 --> 03:37:28.831]  Because this is what the left and the right are so good at, in terms of organizational structures at the top, representing different groups of elites.
[03:37:28.871 --> 03:37:32.472]  It doesn't matter whether they're Republican elites or Democratic elites.
[03:37:32.872 --> 03:37:34.493]  Why do the elites hate Donald Trump?
[03:37:35.146 --> 03:37:36.987]  Because he wasn't part of the team, you know?
[03:37:37.368 --> 03:37:39.910]  He was kind of this maverick, independent guy.
[03:37:40.030 --> 03:37:46.334]  My oldest son and I voted for Donald Trump and the chagrin of every one of my relatives.
[03:37:47.195 --> 03:37:50.117]  But, you know, my view was we needed a disruptor.
[03:37:50.157 --> 03:37:52.979]  We needed someone that would shake the system and change it.
[03:37:53.039 --> 03:37:56.742]  And think about this in the context of this technocracy.
[03:37:57.243 --> 03:38:04.288]  He has the potential of totally changing it if he's listening to these kinds of broadcasts and recognizing the intrusion that happened in his life.
[03:38:05.171 --> 03:38:13.536]  That he now is aware of how they manipulated information, tapped his phones, infiltrated his life.
[03:38:14.737 --> 03:38:33.429]  And they're doing it to every single one of us every single day, which is why this president, another person who has been hammered by the same technocracy, needs to grab it by the... and move on and get the thing fixed.
[03:38:34.409 --> 03:38:36.390]  Because it's gone on too long.
[03:38:36.450 --> 03:38:37.230]  It's gone too far.
[03:38:37.270 --> 03:38:39.111]  It's even touched his presence in the United States.
[03:38:39.552 --> 03:38:52.718]  Even our so-called allies, national leaders' phones were tapped by a bureaucracy, a technocracy that even politicians, many of which are unaware, and many others are complicit.
[03:38:53.138 --> 03:38:54.539]  And why are they cooperating?
[03:38:55.860 --> 03:39:03.964]  Because from Hoover's days and continuing today, through fraternities, organizations, observations,
[03:39:04.844 --> 03:39:19.007]  All the dark secrets are known about all the public players that are out there and they better do what they're told or the rest of the world knows too because there's a whole bunch of wieners out there.
[03:39:19.567 --> 03:39:22.468]  There's a whole bunch of Bill and Hillary's out there.
[03:39:23.208 --> 03:39:32.670]  There's a bunch of people doing criminal activity out there that's excused and then used because when they hit the political high points of their careers,
[03:39:33.539 --> 03:39:34.820]  They do what they're told.
[03:39:35.641 --> 03:39:37.723]  That's the problem, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:38.404 --> 03:39:40.165]  They're no longer representing us.
[03:39:40.226 --> 03:39:42.748]  They're doing instead what they're told.
[03:39:44.109 --> 03:39:49.795]  Because they have them by their hidden parts and they're dragging them through the square dance.
[03:39:50.295 --> 03:39:51.516]  That's what's really going on.
[03:39:51.977 --> 03:39:57.602]  And you and I, I don't want to use the word victims, we're the false beneficiaries of it.
[03:39:58.300 --> 03:40:00.802]  Okay, we're not winning that one.
[03:40:01.082 --> 03:40:03.083]  We're losing that one every step of the way.
[03:40:03.123 --> 03:40:08.446]  Look at how our lives have been reshaped over one generation already, two generations for sure.
[03:40:08.466 --> 03:40:26.077]  From a single household income, from the trades to the professions, you could expect to raise a couple of kids, have a nice home, drive a car, every few years get a different one, save for retirement and have something to look forward to.
[03:40:27.327 --> 03:40:28.770]  And you don't have that anymore.
[03:40:30.233 --> 03:40:35.704]  It's been hijacked by this technocracy and you're told to accept it.
[03:40:35.904 --> 03:40:36.666]  That's okay.
[03:40:37.683 --> 03:40:41.966]  And the guise of, well, you know, we're changing all our roles.
[03:40:41.986 --> 03:40:45.908]  You know, women can now engage outside the home that they didn't do in those days.
[03:40:45.988 --> 03:40:46.949]  I believe in all that.
[03:40:47.049 --> 03:40:48.010]  I think that's true.
[03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:52.393]  But it's also missing a lot of the main points.
[03:40:52.433 --> 03:40:55.014]  We've lost a lot of our freedom and liberty along the way.
[03:40:55.294 --> 03:40:57.496]  Because the free time we used to have
[03:40:58.096 --> 03:41:00.558]  The time we used to have, we don't have anymore.
[03:41:00.598 --> 03:41:01.438]  It's consumed.
[03:41:01.859 --> 03:41:19.490]  Time we used to have to pay attention to what was going on in the world, to read, to engage, to teach our children, to engage with our neighbors on a face-to-face basis, not with an electronic mirror, an interface that makes sure the data stops for the intermute areas to review.
[03:41:20.928 --> 03:41:32.166]  That's how most people communicate, whether it's on a cell phone, an iPad, the internet, whatever, you know, it's all electronically, digitally captured along the way and then used.
[03:41:32.895 --> 03:41:34.716]  For all different kinds of purposes.
[03:41:35.676 --> 03:41:44.400]  And so, you know, when I think about the synthetic systems of technology, they're kind of trying to mirror what human beings fundamentally are.
[03:41:44.420 --> 03:41:52.464]  And this is what gets lost in the shuffle, and one of the points I like to bring out, because a lot of my work goes back to the whole mind affects concepts.
[03:41:52.544 --> 03:41:54.925]  What can you do with the human brain?
[03:41:55.005 --> 03:41:58.267]  What can you do to move thought differently?
[03:41:58.860 --> 03:42:07.830]  And government really learned a lot in this realm, and I've written on this book, Controlling the Human Mind, which InfoWars store has available.
[03:42:08.231 --> 03:42:15.659]  You know, this book is 250 sources showing the evolution of mind control and propaganda at the ultimate level.
[03:42:16.235 --> 03:42:17.756]  Manipulating what goes on in your brain.
[03:42:18.116 --> 03:42:23.759]  The next jump for the internet that they're talking about, even PBS had a special called the World Wide Mind.
[03:42:23.999 --> 03:42:24.559]  Look it up.
[03:42:25.020 --> 03:42:26.901]  The World Wide Mind, PBS.
[03:42:26.941 --> 03:42:31.723]  The next connection for the internet isn't going to be a bunch of computers you can decide to turn off.
[03:42:31.743 --> 03:42:35.405]  It's going to be the mind of each human being on the planet.
[03:42:35.825 --> 03:42:37.586]  That's the prediction for the future.
[03:42:37.606 --> 03:42:40.628]  Imagine your mind linked to everyone else synthetically in some way.
[03:42:41.656 --> 03:42:43.278]  Drawing and looking at that data.
[03:42:43.739 --> 03:42:44.900]  This is where we're headed.
[03:42:45.261 --> 03:42:49.967]  And yet, fundamentally, as human beings, as living souls, we already do this.
[03:42:50.287 --> 03:42:51.368]  We're already linked.
[03:42:51.529 --> 03:42:54.733]  We need to remember what we are, get back to our fundamentals.
[03:42:55.193 --> 03:42:57.016]  That's the beginning of the Info Wars.
[03:42:57.076 --> 03:42:58.197]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:42:58.217 --> 03:43:00.260]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:43:09.798 --> 03:43:11.439]  We have a new super special.
[03:43:11.539 --> 03:43:13.461]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[03:43:14.122 --> 03:43:19.566]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[03:43:19.586 --> 03:43:20.487]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[03:43:20.587 --> 03:43:21.087]  Hope you get it.
[03:43:21.107 --> 03:43:21.948]  It supports the broadcast.
[03:43:21.968 --> 03:43:22.508]  Spreads the word.
[03:43:22.528 --> 03:43:23.429]  It's a great conversation piece.
[03:43:23.549 --> 03:43:23.749]  It's 33% off.
[03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:26.811]  Because we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[03:43:27.011 --> 03:43:29.312]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[03:43:29.813 --> 03:43:32.354]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[03:43:32.414 --> 03:43:35.016]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[03:43:35.036 --> 03:43:36.917]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[03:43:36.937 --> 03:43:37.617]  50% off.
[03:43:37.697 --> 03:43:38.998]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[03:43:39.098 --> 03:43:40.399]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[03:43:40.499 --> 03:43:44.661]  Turbo Force, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[03:43:44.841 --> 03:43:46.662]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[03:43:46.822 --> 03:43:48.523]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[03:43:48.783 --> 03:43:50.144]  All of the Force products.
[03:43:50.264 --> 03:43:51.345]  It's got Force in the name.
[03:43:51.565 --> 03:43:53.286]  It's 50-30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:53.386 --> 03:43:54.787]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:16.241 --> 03:44:23.384]  Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?
[03:44:24.305 --> 03:44:32.569]  Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind!
[03:44:34.214 --> 03:44:36.476]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[03:44:36.516 --> 03:44:39.779]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[03:44:39.799 --> 03:44:43.163]  To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time!
[03:44:43.263 --> 03:44:48.508]  And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[03:44:50.931 --> 03:44:51.892]  Not yet!
[03:44:52.033 --> 03:44:52.733]  Do not be!
[03:45:10.083 --> 03:45:12.325]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[03:45:12.365 --> 03:45:14.967]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[03:45:15.007 --> 03:45:25.796]  To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes, and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[03:45:25.837 --> 03:45:27.798]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of wrists!
[03:45:28.038 --> 03:45:35.265]  I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds!
[03:45:36.974 --> 03:45:38.054]  Well, you just wait.
[03:45:38.114 --> 03:45:44.256]  They'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the ASPCA, you mangy mutt!
[03:45:46.476 --> 03:45:48.257]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[03:45:48.297 --> 03:45:51.938]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[03:45:51.998 --> 03:45:55.419]  To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time!
[03:45:55.479 --> 03:46:00.560]  And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[03:46:04.680 --> 03:46:21.052]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:46:33.621 --> 03:46:43.169]  Sometimes in life, your pipes just get a little clogged up, a little backed up, and you just can't get that clearance and that push that you need.
[03:46:43.769 --> 03:46:50.294]  But with Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com, that will no longer be an issue.
[03:46:50.655 --> 03:46:54.257]  But watch out, because this stuff is powerful.
[03:46:54.858 --> 03:47:01.083]  Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com clears those pipes that have been giving you all that backup.
[03:47:06.162 --> 03:47:08.780]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:32.185 --> 03:47:34.966]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:47:34.986 --> 03:47:50.033]  This is Dr. Nick Begich in this Friday afternoon, in this fourth hour, and we've been talking a lot about the technocracy today and also about sort of the underlying values of how to sort of come at the conversation and what's being lost in a lot of this.
[03:47:51.670 --> 03:48:13.199]  Is the profiling, when you think about this profiling that we're talking about, which is really, again, collecting all that data and then looking at the individual, and then what is intended by the feedback loop that we're in is to excite your emotions, because then you sort of turn off the intellectual part and you start moving.
[03:48:14.341 --> 03:48:18.807]  And the emotions are meant to work with the intellectual part.
[03:48:18.847 --> 03:48:24.254]  You know, I think about emotions again as sort of part of that matrix of experiences.
[03:48:24.854 --> 03:48:33.205]  You know, you're a father, you're a mother, you're a parent, you're a brother, you're a sister, you're an employee, you're, you know, you're all these things.
[03:48:34.187 --> 03:48:43.257]  And these are activities that you engage in, experiences that we engage in that spring from what we are internally from a point of awareness.
[03:48:43.757 --> 03:48:45.779]  This is how I segregate the two.
[03:48:45.819 --> 03:48:51.305]  When the awareness is in control, these things we do kind of line up.
[03:48:52.131 --> 03:49:02.875]  And manifesting differently for everyone, but in certain lines of activity and inquiry that continues to amplify what I call the divinity in us.
[03:49:02.915 --> 03:49:19.800]  And this is the greatest power against the technocracy, is stepping into what you are and kind of remembering what's possible when sovereign people recognize it only takes one or two to make huge changes by just doing what is possible.
[03:49:21.025 --> 03:49:22.066]  I want to say that again.
[03:49:22.387 --> 03:49:24.089]  Do what's possible.
[03:49:24.109 --> 03:49:32.478]  A lot of people believe that you need this big grand plan that's so grand and so big you can't conceive that it can happen.
[03:49:33.239 --> 03:49:34.140]  Well, that won't work.
[03:49:35.881 --> 03:49:41.788]  Creation happens either in the universe or on the planet or through you as a creating
[03:49:42.812 --> 03:49:45.073]  You gotta have the faith to know what you can do.
[03:49:45.893 --> 03:49:48.895]  That's why if you know what you can do, it gets done.
[03:49:49.295 --> 03:49:54.257]  You know, that's the faith of a mustard seed analogy that we all have heard in our lifetimes.
[03:49:54.877 --> 03:50:00.279]  It's knowing what you can act on that's right and true, and that you're fortified to go and do.
[03:50:00.659 --> 03:50:02.280]  And then just jump into it and do it.
[03:50:02.700 --> 03:50:07.482]  You know, and that's the mark of an info warrior, actually, is that.
[03:50:08.122 --> 03:50:09.723]  It's not doing the impossible.
[03:50:09.803 --> 03:50:12.183]  It's not convincing someone that cannot be convinced.
[03:50:12.644 --> 03:50:17.445]  It's living a life that exemplifies that info war of what you are.
[03:50:17.865 --> 03:50:31.550]  All those things that you want to attach to in terms of ideas, concepts, objections, you know, things to be outraged over, they're all secondary to the underlying values in which you convey your information.
[03:50:31.570 --> 03:50:34.611]  If you can't do it on a platform of awareness,
[03:50:35.450 --> 03:50:36.511]  Which is what you are.
[03:50:37.091 --> 03:50:39.233]  Of your divinity, if you want to call it that.
[03:50:39.813 --> 03:50:44.636]  Or whatever you want to call it, that really is the essence of what we are as human beings.
[03:50:44.736 --> 03:50:47.178]  It drives us through our experiences.
[03:50:47.838 --> 03:50:49.680]  That's what you should be calling the shots.
[03:50:49.740 --> 03:50:57.585]  And so, you know, one of the simple things, you know, when anger arises in you, the way to control it is just to look at it for a second.
[03:50:58.405 --> 03:51:04.970]  You know, as soon as you notice it, you literally can decide whether to continue in that vein, let it just carry you away,
[03:51:05.859 --> 03:51:09.380]  Or whether you are going to assert the awareness that you are in control of it.
[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:11.540]  The same is true with any other emotion.
[03:51:12.300 --> 03:51:14.721]  You decide how you engage it.
[03:51:14.781 --> 03:51:15.741]  You still experience it.
[03:51:15.801 --> 03:51:18.422]  Don't shut it off, because that makes you a sociopath.
[03:51:18.902 --> 03:51:28.044]  Experience it, but don't let it run away with, you know, this is the difference between someone who's awake and aware, remembering their divinity and what they are.
[03:51:28.604 --> 03:51:30.244]  At their rest, this is someone who doesn't.
[03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:32.351]  That's it.
[03:51:32.431 --> 03:51:33.732]  That's the big difference, right?
[03:51:33.772 --> 03:51:35.834]  I mean, at least as a starting point.
[03:51:37.956 --> 03:51:49.106]  And so when we think about all the conflicts that all of us are very upset about, and the way in which technology is working to sort of rob us of this aspect of who we are.
[03:51:49.526 --> 03:52:18.696]  You know, a lot of my research in the early days was about mind effects, mind control technologies, all the stuff that people heard about from the Manchurian candidates to MKUltra, the church committee investigation of the early 70s where all of this was disclosed, and the abuses of the CIA that were disclosed, and on and on and on, you know, and like Alex and several others, you know, we remember this and we try to convey it in a contextual way.
[03:52:19.329 --> 03:52:22.892]  Within a broader framework so that we can change it.
[03:52:23.132 --> 03:52:29.278]  And so it starts with each individual doing what you believe is right and true and stepping into that.
[03:52:29.478 --> 03:52:31.620]  That's the act of faith because you already know it.
[03:52:32.280 --> 03:52:34.302]  Don't do more than you know you can do, but do that.
[03:52:34.762 --> 03:52:40.948]  And everyone has a different thing they can do in the furtherance of their individual truth.
[03:52:41.008 --> 03:52:42.489]  And then chasing truth.
[03:52:42.609 --> 03:52:46.793]  One of the things I found is oftentimes you got to let go of what you thought was true because
[03:52:47.473 --> 03:52:48.854]  You got new information.
[03:52:50.575 --> 03:53:00.822]  And that's the mark of an intelligent person, truly evolving person, and remembering what you are again, because I think it all takes us back to our source.
[03:53:01.262 --> 03:53:07.527]  And when you look at what's happening in the world, it is essentially trying to duplicate this artificially.
[03:53:07.567 --> 03:53:13.731]  I was talking about the worldwide mind, something that PBS report on the idea of linking everybody's mind.
[03:53:14.694 --> 03:53:15.814]  In a synthetic way.
[03:53:16.495 --> 03:53:24.617]  And that's like makes what's going on now look like nothing, like nothing at all compared to that thought.
[03:53:24.857 --> 03:53:26.558]  But I believe we already do that.
[03:53:26.678 --> 03:53:27.798]  We already have that.
[03:53:28.258 --> 03:53:32.620]  If we can remember what we are and if we're responsible enough, you know, we'll fall into that.
[03:53:32.680 --> 03:53:33.700]  In fact, think about this.
[03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:39.382]  If that's true, if man can create this, think about what Judgment Day is.
[03:53:40.667 --> 03:53:42.049]  Is it going to be blackmail day?
[03:53:42.069 --> 03:53:48.415]  Or is it going to be decide who belongs in jail based on what you think day?
[03:53:49.116 --> 03:53:50.878]  Or is it judgment day?
[03:53:52.088 --> 03:53:54.129]  You know, think about this when it happens naturally.
[03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:57.470]  When the book of life is opened, all knowledge is revealed.
[03:53:57.871 --> 03:53:59.531]  And then there's this gnashing of teeth.
[03:53:59.631 --> 03:54:09.896]  I think that might be that day that we know what's in the minds of everyone else, and we are totally naked in front of the universe and the creation itself.
[03:54:10.536 --> 03:54:15.218]  And in that moment, we better be awful forgiving of ourselves at a starting point.
[03:54:16.548 --> 03:54:32.701]  And have grown at some level from the mistakes we've made, but more importantly, be forgiving also of each other and having experienced the same humanness of this experience, and hopefully growing in that humanness in a way that makes us
[03:54:34.890 --> 03:54:39.053]  More aware, more awake, more in connection with what we are fundamentally.
[03:54:39.553 --> 03:54:46.318]  And as we fall into that connection fundamentally, this is where we change the world, when we recognize what we are truly created to do.
[03:54:46.338 --> 03:54:59.287]  You know, when you think about the brain as sort of this connecting point, you know, sort of think about it as the plug-in to your energetic spiritual nature, you know, sort of the medium of the brain.
[03:54:59.648 --> 03:55:00.949]  You have a left brain and a right brain.
[03:55:00.969 --> 03:55:04.291]  The right brain is order, the left brain is creative.
[03:55:05.032 --> 03:55:05.893]  Okay.
[03:55:05.973 --> 03:55:07.415]  Or chaos, you could even say.
[03:55:08.056 --> 03:55:16.206]  And if you can get both of these working together, this is where you get this incredible possibility set.
[03:55:17.068 --> 03:55:22.735]  And it's sort of the beginning point of how we project in the world, and then through our words and our thoughts, we create.
[03:55:23.877 --> 03:55:25.518]  Wow, that's pretty amazing.
[03:55:25.538 --> 03:55:30.721]  You know, no other creature on the planet creates in the way humans are capable of creating.
[03:55:31.101 --> 03:55:33.802]  But it's not just the physical form.
[03:55:33.843 --> 03:55:34.823]  This is nothing.
[03:55:34.863 --> 03:55:40.106]  This is the shell through which we emerge into the earth and do our work in the earth.
[03:55:40.146 --> 03:55:42.507]  And we should do it respectfully and we should do it mindfully.
[03:55:42.527 --> 03:55:51.012]  And if we believe at all that we're creating the image and likeness of God, which many who listen to this program profess to believe, we should behave this way.
[03:55:51.661 --> 03:55:57.809]  We should behave no matter what the conflict is that we're facing, but we should try to find the path through it.
[03:55:58.269 --> 03:56:01.073]  You know, this is the path through order and chaos.
[03:56:02.489 --> 03:56:14.783]  And in fact, when both hemispheres of the brain come together, and they're both working in harmony together, the way they're intended, the way small children actually function more predominantly than adults.
[03:56:15.343 --> 03:56:19.808]  Think about this, you know, pay attention to small children, but their brains are more balanced.
[03:56:19.868 --> 03:56:21.250]  So they tend to be very creative.
[03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:23.152]  They learn it at an accelerated rate.
[03:56:23.192 --> 03:56:24.013]  Think about all of
[03:56:24.133 --> 03:56:31.379]  What is learned between three and five year olds in that range when their brains are the best balance and they're just maturing.
[03:56:31.900 --> 03:56:45.211]  And then we begin to carve that away with our institutions that so closely identify what we are with this carrier and these experiences that we have and people thrust on us in terms of our cultures that tell us who we are.
[03:56:45.832 --> 03:56:47.053]  But that is not who we are.
[03:56:47.651 --> 03:56:53.114]  Those are experiences and cultures, and they are separate from who we are fundamentally.
[03:56:53.294 --> 03:57:11.583]  And this gets back down to the core, the essence of what changes the world is individuals acting individually, not in a squishy collective, not in a highly monitored and directed society, the stuff of futurists and globalists and the elites.
[03:57:12.344 --> 03:57:21.410]  But one in a society that's based upon the freedom of the soul, the freedom of creativity, and the freedom of dialogue and discussion.
[03:57:21.810 --> 03:57:27.394]  And certainly it ought to be a lot more respectful than what we've seen demonstrated recently.
[03:57:28.149 --> 03:57:39.634]  But let's end this Friday on a note of let's spend the time thinking about what we can do and do a little bit, even if it's a smile to your neighbor or a step in a bigger direction.
[03:57:40.114 --> 03:57:45.556]  This has been Dr. Nick Begich in this fourth hour of InfoWars, changing the way we see the world.
[03:57:45.976 --> 03:57:46.917]  Let's do that together.
[03:57:46.937 --> 03:57:47.937]  You're the tip of the spear.
