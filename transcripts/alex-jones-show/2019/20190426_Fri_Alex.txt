[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.846]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:26.009]  Well, there's some good things happening and some bad things happening.
[00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.532]  Trump is making his move on the deep state.
[00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:31.174]  This is going to be dangerous, though.
[00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:33.676]  And the border has officially collapsed.
[00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:34.437]  It's all coming up.
[00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:41.182]  But first, an important report by one of our reporters breaking down white guilt won't stop hate, it will cause it.
[00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:41.543]  Here it is.
[00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:47.860]  Modern society is doing great damage to the next generation and those that will come after it.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.425]  Not only are they damaging the next generation, but they're creating a problem which they are now claiming to solve.
[00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.426]  A problem that does not yet exist.
[00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:05.012]  Now, you probably know that children these days are being damaged, but it's likely not only in the way that you think.
[00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.713]  You probably know the situation.
[00:01:08.454 --> 00:01:10.054]  Kids are taught to hate themselves.
[00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:13.335]  White students are taught that they are naturally racist.
[00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.876]  Boys are taught that they innately oppress women.
[00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:25.598]  Natural born American citizens are taught that they owe something to immigrants, specifically illegal immigrants.
[00:01:27.578 --> 00:01:32.959]  Above all, they are taught that they are bad and that they are deserving of hate.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.200]  That they should hate themselves.
[00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:39.439]  Now it may be damaging to be taught to hate yourself.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.042]  Indeed it is, but that's only the surface level.
[00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:47.406]  We need to look at what's happening and why it can happen.
[00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:51.189]  Americans are notoriously compassionate.
[00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:59.078]  We're compassionate because we are taught to be, but it's not even that we are taught to be because that's not necessary.
[00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.522]  We are compassionate because we are told that we are.
[00:02:03.382 --> 00:02:10.389]  As a culture, it's naturally accepted that we care for people, that we want to help people whom we have wronged.
[00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.932]  We want to help people that have been wronged by other people.
[00:02:15.054 --> 00:02:26.063]  There's been no other nation in the history of the Earth, or any organization for that matter, that has exerted the amount of force in favor of humanitarian efforts as America has.
[00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:31.351]  And this is the very reason that self-hatred can take root.
[00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:37.415]  We have been taught that if we do something wrong to someone, then we owe them something.
[00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:38.656]  We need to make amends.
[00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:39.776]  We need to help them out.
[00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:46.000]  If somebody is less fortunate than us, we're taught that we owe something to them, that we need to lift them up.
[00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:51.324]  Not because of some political ideology, but because we should care about our neighbor.
[00:02:52.972 --> 00:03:09.162]  And yes, while we are no longer a Christian nation, and while political parties and governments can never be themselves Christian, it's no doubt that Christianity had an undeniable influence on the way that our culture operates.
[00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:21.309]  But what happens when an entire generation is raised to think that they are hateful, cold, pragmatic people that are willing to do whatever it takes to get to the end that they want?
[00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:29.529]  The elite want white, straight Americans to believe that they are totally evil, yet also continue to act in a compassionate manner.
[00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.493]  They want them to continue to believe that they are evil, while also acting in a way that evil people do not.
[00:03:38.894 --> 00:03:40.215]  But that is not how it works.
[00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:46.398]  For now, we have people that have been taught that they are evil, and because of their kind nature, they will try to make amends.
[00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:52.977]  But someday we will have a generation that has fully internalized hate.
[00:03:54.337 --> 00:04:08.221]  And when they see the consequences of diversity and multiculturalism, religious and ethnic pluralism, they will not respond like compassionate people, because they have been taught that they are not compassionate people.
[00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:18.323]  They have been taught that at their very nature, they are hateful, cold, and willing to do whatever it takes to solve a problem, even at the expense of other human life.
[00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:30.999]  When a group has fully internalized an identity centered around hate, the results will not be kind because only compassionate people feel guilt.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.201]  This is Jake Lloyd reporting for NewsWords.com.
[00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.156]  It's April 26, 2019 on this Friday edition.
[00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:49.637]  I am loaded for bear.
[00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:52.358]  Believe me, this is one broadcast you do not want to miss.
[00:04:52.938 --> 00:05:00.381]  Whatever you do, on the local radio station you're listening to or over the internet watching us right now, spread the word about how other folks can tune in.
[00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.334]  Please remember that we're listener supported and wear your colors proud.
[00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:12.276]  They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:13.797]  It's supposed to end a day ago.
[00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:14.178]  It didn't.
[00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:14.838]  It's still there.
[00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:15.559]  Take advantage of it.
[00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.702]  Also, Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 25% off.
[00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:21.164]  Get a free bottle of Knockout, the amazing Sleep Aid.
[00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:22.626]  So we got awake and we got sleepy.
[00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:24.308]  We got chill and we got raging.
[00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:26.670]  We've got it both right now at a great deal.
[00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.673]  Get Brain Force 25% off and get a free bottle of Knockout.
[00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:32.635]  Get them both at 50% off and then decide which one you like.
[00:05:44.983 --> 00:05:47.164]  They're both different formulas, but both very strong.
[00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:48.385]  Tell us which one you like the best.
[00:05:48.405 --> 00:05:53.027]  Get them both at half off, so you can experience both of them at half off, so you can see which one you like best.
[00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.008]  Or take them together.
[00:05:54.148 --> 00:05:59.490]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.692]  But whatever you do, take action.
[00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:14.418]  We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.
[00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:22.829]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.990]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.674]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:37.318]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:48.873]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[00:06:48.913 --> 00:06:53.176]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[00:06:53.256 --> 00:06:56.298]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:03.549]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:08.332]  From the front lines of the Info Room, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:14.836]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:15.576 --> 00:07:22.140]  Think about the synchronicity, the serendipity that I only decided to go to D.C.
[00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:22.621]  a week ago.
[00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:24.748]  I fly in.
[00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:28.350]  I've been planning to bullhorn the White House on Wednesday.
[00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.251]  But I felt a disturbance in the force.
[00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:36.113]  And I said, we must go to the White House now.
[00:07:36.713 --> 00:07:37.714]  And we've checked the times.
[00:07:38.554 --> 00:07:39.734]  I was there for 45 minutes.
[00:07:40.535 --> 00:07:47.738]  I was bullhorning while Jack Dorsey came in and spoke for the entire meeting with the President.
[00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:49.238]  And the President could hear it.
[00:07:49.258 --> 00:07:53.000]  There's other folks that know how to use bullhorns properly that are out there.
[00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:55.846]  I ought to give lessons.
[00:07:56.106 --> 00:07:57.067]  I'm not joking.
[00:07:57.987 --> 00:08:09.070]  And then, of course, Fox News covered it, a bunch of others covered the fact that I was pointing out that Jack Dorsey specifically had lied to Congress when he said they don't censor.
[00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:16.953]  They then thought, and the President, I'm told, thought that Jones had inside sources on the meeting that only a few people knew about.
[00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:17.713]  I didn't!
[00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.791]  I did not have inside sources.
[00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:26.557]  It just keeps happening, over and over again, that on the same day, at the same time, Trump and I will say the same thing.
[00:08:27.218 --> 00:08:28.739]  And that's been noticed, it's been picked up.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:37.727]  I did a live broadcast about an hour before Trump's inauguration in 2017, and I laid out what his speech would be about, even though no one had leaked it.
[00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:44.634]  And it was exactly that speech, that Providence was coming back into America, that Trump would invoke God and invite God back into America.
[00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:49.475]  That Trump would make the announcement that secret technologies would be deployed to the people.
[00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:52.476]  It all happened, and I just knew he was going to do it.
[00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:54.776]  There's some weird stuff going on here, folks.
[00:08:55.656 --> 00:09:07.259]  Now, most of the time I go off research and documentation, but when Spidey Sense goes off, I tell people, it's a gut, we're going to see what's going to happen, it's my nose, and it ends up happening every time.
[00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:10.320]  There's a lot of things going on in this universe, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:14.737]  And everybody has a sixth sense that God gave us.
[00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:21.882]  It's just that if you ignore it, your heart hardens, your soul hardens, as the Bible says, and it stops working.
[00:09:22.622 --> 00:09:23.683]  You become delusional.
[00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:26.785]  You're turned over to great delusion, as the Bible says.
[00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:31.228]  But if you go with it, it becomes stronger and more powerful.
[00:09:32.349 --> 00:09:35.511]  Now, this is going to be another incredible broadcast today, let me tell you.
[00:09:38.132 --> 00:09:43.173]  I'm tempted here to just go ahead and cancel guests we had coming up today because I want to be able to clear the decks.
[00:09:43.213 --> 00:09:44.033]  In fact, we're going to do that.
[00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:54.476]  We're going to cancel everybody but Dr. Nick Magich, who's hosting the fourth hour, because we're going to drill directly into this cornucopia that I'm about to go over here.
[00:09:56.116 --> 00:10:06.899]  First off, tomorrow's news today, next year's news today, you as a hardcore focused audience that are the tip of the spear in this country and the world are going to say we've heard this 5,000 times, we know it's true.
[00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.729]  It's really happening.
[00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.370]  Trump has caught them.
[00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:22.734]  More documents came out yesterday of Strzok and Page, after Trump was in the White House, trying to manipulate their moles inside the White House.
[00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:32.418]  You've now got Samantha Powers and the rest of them coming out and saying, oh, other people might have jumped into our computers and, you know,
[00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:36.496]  Given the authorization for unmasking via the NSA.
[00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:44.158]  You've got Clapper and Brennan on TV running around saying that, oh, we were under orders of Obama so we can't go to jail.
[00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:53.841]  They're saying all of that because they know they've committed major crimes and they know Trump is not business as usual and that they're about to get their asses prosecuted.
[00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:54.941]  This is real.
[00:10:56.062 --> 00:10:56.862]  This is happening.
[00:10:57.742 --> 00:11:00.363]  This is going down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:04.732]  And so get ready for major fireworks.
[00:11:04.753 --> 00:11:05.994]  We're going to be going over all of it.
[00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:13.783]  And I don't normally air large segments of someone else's show, but when it's newsworthy and a public service announcement and it's the president, I do.
[00:11:14.304 --> 00:11:19.530]  We're going to air probably 20 minutes of Sean Hannity this hour.
[00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:29.477]  And then I'm tempted to come in tomorrow and do a whole two-hour special with the 45 minutes that the president was on with Sean last night, because it was historic.
[00:11:30.018 --> 00:11:36.443]  Trump went right down the line of what he's going to do, what they've been caught doing, and now we're going to slit the throat of the deep state once and for all.
[00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:39.165]  And it's exactly what I told you was coming.
[00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:44.108]  I told you yesterday that I talked to not one, not two, but three people.
[00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:46.310]  Three people.
[00:11:47.469 --> 00:11:53.833]  Who had talked to the President, two of them in person, last week, when I was in D.C.
[00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:56.335]  I gotta spend more time in D.C., man.
[00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:58.537]  It's just amazing the contacts we've got.
[00:11:58.577 --> 00:12:02.059]  How we can just walk into any of these offices, any of these facilities, and talk to folks.
[00:12:02.439 --> 00:12:03.660]  And they just give us the intel.
[00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:09.024]  And I was told, go ahead and release who told me this, but... I'm not gonna do it.
[00:12:10.545 --> 00:12:11.346]  Just to leave it at that.
[00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:14.068]  But, uh... One obviously was a journalist.
[00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:15.829]  Another...
[00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:29.179]  Well, someone falsely accused of the Russiagate garbage he met with the President, and I'm not going to get into who the other one was, but they said Trump is going after them, and he went on Hannity and said it last night.
[00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:32.660]  So this is a big deal.
[00:12:33.681 --> 00:12:36.762]  This is a really big deal, and if you're not getting chills,
[00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.499]  I'm getting them right now.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:45.102]  The opportunity to rout the Globalist and really get a fresh start is so good for all of our children, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:12:45.482 --> 00:12:53.586]  But the danger of how the Globalists are going to strike back has got my spidey sense just bang!
[00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:59.608]  I mean, use the old Lord of the Rings allegory of Sting, the goblin cleaver.
[00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:02.430]  When goblins or orcs get nearby, it starts glowing.
[00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:04.147]  Blue-white.
[00:13:04.948 --> 00:13:07.430]  I don't think Sting's ever glown this blue.
[00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.072]  Let me tell you, they are close, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:11.993 --> 00:13:13.974]  It's the allegory of the blue state, the blue sword.
[00:13:14.715 --> 00:13:15.996]  They are upon us.
[00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:17.517]  Drums, drums in the deep.
[00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:21.160]  Get ready, because they're coming up out of their rat holes on us right now.
[00:13:22.162 --> 00:13:37.554]  And then the latest on the collapsing border and how to stop it, and how the globalists are going to strike back, and all the big internet censorship, and the craziness of the Middle East, and what's happening with the economy growing, despite the Federal Reserve trying to spike it, coming back to 3.2% again.
[00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.437]  That's right, daylight came back again for that.
[00:13:40.977 --> 00:13:44.119]  There's so much we're going to be discussing here today.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.862]  And I'm going to get into the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
[00:13:48.323 --> 00:13:49.384]  And I've talked a lot about this.
[00:13:50.506 --> 00:14:02.270]  But I've really studied it over the years, and when they made their move on the new Secretary of Defense, the Acting Secretary, I did a bunch of research, and shame on the Democrats again.
[00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:07.392]  Just wait till I cover what's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:14:07.852 --> 00:14:18.636]  But first, this sale will end on Monday, because we're selling out of the Brain Force Plus, the best nootropic out there, other brands that are similar.
[00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:20.519]  That's right.
[00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:40.130]  We don't make much money on it because we sell it for so low.
[00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.130]  $19.95.
[00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:41.931]  It's got eight ingredients in it.
[00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:43.772]  Knockout, sleep support.
[00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:45.352]  It's got the L-tryptophan.
[00:14:45.412 --> 00:14:46.413]  It's got the valerian root.
[00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:47.813]  It's got the melatonin.
[00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:52.635]  All at regular dosages and six other ingredients or five other ingredients.
[00:14:53.236 --> 00:14:56.337]  All that synergistically work together for deeper, cleaner, healthier
[00:14:57.137 --> 00:14:57.477]  Sleep.
[00:14:58.158 --> 00:15:00.359]  And when I forget to take it, I'm like, why did I take that?
[00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:01.359]  I slept so good.
[00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:02.780]  I've got so much energy.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.781]  It's not just buy the supplements, it's take the supplements, and myself included.
[00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:10.203]  I'll ramp up and take them all, feel great, do great, then forget.
[00:15:10.223 --> 00:15:11.824]  Because they'll sell out or something.
[00:15:12.024 --> 00:15:15.025]  A lot of times I carry them home myself, and then I'll run out.
[00:15:15.545 --> 00:15:16.926]  I ran out of colloidal silver this week.
[00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.387]  Uh, and had to bring some from the warehouse.
[00:15:20.047 --> 00:15:23.149]  I need to sign up for AutoShip for every product I use routinely.
[00:15:23.369 --> 00:15:31.453]  Whether it's the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, or whether it's the Lake of America Coffee, or whether it's the Great Protein Bars that are the highest quality, super high-end at a low price.
[00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:33.455]  Infowarestore.com
[00:15:34.514 --> 00:15:35.794]  And you're funding the Second American Revolution.
[00:15:36.134 --> 00:15:37.555]  But we have to end this special.
[00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:39.295]  We have some great new specials next week.
[00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:42.216]  But this one has to end and it will end on Monday.
[00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:50.998]  Take advantage of the Buy Brain Force Plus Get Knockout Free Combo at Infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:15:51.438 --> 00:15:55.239]  But whatever you do, tell folks how you're listening to the show on local AM and FM.
[00:15:55.619 --> 00:15:57.360]  Tell everyone it's an Infowar.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.880]  Circumvent the censors.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.640]  It's a fight.
[00:16:00.221 --> 00:16:01.341]  It's a heavyweight battle.
[00:16:03.052 --> 00:16:11.934]  Globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[00:16:12.394 --> 00:16:21.816]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels or oligopolies.
[00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:26.337]  Groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[00:16:26.877 --> 00:16:29.879]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:40.264]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:44.547]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[00:16:44.947 --> 00:16:46.808]  And that's why the globalists who were arrogant
[00:16:47.088 --> 00:17:05.908]  are now panicking and trying to censor InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and my syndicated radio show because they know we've got our finger on the pulse of what's happening and that the President and the Pentagon and others are listening and know that we're telling the truth and we've basically become the modern Paul Revere transmission of this Republic.
[00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:21.719]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching and listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated, and this restoration of the Republic could be defeated.
[00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:27.003]  So please keep spreading the word, and whatever you do, remember, we're only financed now by you.
[00:17:27.563 --> 00:17:28.364]  We're in your hands.
[00:17:28.504 --> 00:17:29.665]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:17:29.885 --> 00:17:32.307]  We've got huge specials running on a continued basis.
[00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:33.668]  Hundreds of great products.
[00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:36.811]  Things you and your family already need, like fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:17:37.091 --> 00:17:37.772]  High quality.
[00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:43.617]  Again, the highest quality organic coffee that people absolutely love.
[00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:45.959]  Great protein bars and so much more.
[00:17:46.219 --> 00:17:49.002]  When you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off on future orders.
[00:17:49.502 --> 00:17:52.565]  Come to InfoWareStore.com today and continue to support
[00:17:52.925 --> 00:17:55.106]  Free speech and freedom at the tip of the spear.
[00:17:55.346 --> 00:17:58.648]  Thank you all for your support, and God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.251]  I'm right up here on the left.
[00:18:07.432 --> 00:18:13.935]  Actually, the road's closed, so you can turn around in the driveway at the bottom of the hill.
[00:18:13.975 --> 00:18:14.976]  Have a good night.
[00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:19.638]  Face-to-face with 16-year-old high school... Excuse me!
[00:18:21.765 --> 00:18:22.328]  Keep going!
[00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.870]  Go!
[00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:53.290]  And really, it was just a matter of time before we saw something like this, and I'm really surprised that we haven't seen something worse.
[00:18:56.951 --> 00:19:00.092]  People always ask, what does it mean to make America great again?
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:23.600]  You alright?
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.721]  Man, it's hard to stop the snow, man.
[00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:27.521]  Should I give you a push?
[00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:28.221]  Yeah, please.
[00:19:28.241 --> 00:19:29.401]  I appreciate it.
[00:19:37.723 --> 00:19:39.604]  Alright, look.
[00:19:39.624 --> 00:19:40.744]  Here's what we're gonna have to do.
[00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:41.744]  I'm gonna push.
[00:19:41.984 --> 00:19:42.965]  Don't hit the brakes at all.
[00:19:43.045 --> 00:19:44.165]  You just gotta keep going.
[00:19:56.503 --> 00:20:00.028]  It means to make America a better place than it was the day before.
[00:20:06.476 --> 00:20:09.079]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.943]  Ladies and gentlemen, the president just took the stage at the NRA convention to give a speech.
[00:20:26.963 --> 00:20:28.624]  We're gonna pop into that.
[00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:30.265]  He's finishing up giving introductions.
[00:20:30.685 --> 00:20:35.387]  Then we'll go to his bombshell interview last night where he confirmed everything I told you the last two days.
[00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:38.869]  That he is preparing to go out to the deep state with criminal charges.
[00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:40.310]  He's got them dead in the sights.
[00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.511]  Historic time.
[00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:42.431]  Let's go to the president.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.681]  And he's stronger and better.
[00:20:46.701 --> 00:20:51.402]  I actually told him backstage, I said, you're much more handsome than you were two years ago.
[00:20:51.422 --> 00:20:52.563]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:55.144]  And he is, Steve Scalise.
[00:20:55.164 --> 00:20:56.284]  A lot of courage.
[00:20:57.425 --> 00:20:57.865]  Thank you.
[00:20:59.305 --> 00:20:59.966]  Thank you, Steve.
[00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:08.029]  And most importantly, I want to thank all of you, the proud card-carrying members of the NRA.
[00:21:14.173 --> 00:21:22.578]  Every day you stand up for our God-given rights without exception, without fail, and without apology.
[00:21:23.939 --> 00:21:30.163]  Together we are fighting for the timeless values that have built and sustained our nation.
[00:21:31.243 --> 00:21:36.926]  And our nation is greater today than it has ever been.
[00:21:37.447 --> 00:21:38.047]  Stronger.
[00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:39.028]  Richer.
[00:21:39.188 --> 00:21:40.929]  We're doing better than ever before.
[00:21:42.048 --> 00:21:43.189]  We are great Americans.
[00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:44.229]  You're doing a great job.
[00:21:44.249 --> 00:21:46.090]  Thank you.
[00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.631]  Thank you.
[00:21:49.652 --> 00:21:57.635]  We believe in the rule of law, and we will always protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:21:57.855 --> 00:21:58.075]  Yeah!
[00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:02.137]  Boy, this is holy water to vampires right now.
[00:22:02.257 --> 00:22:04.758]  And there are some people that are running right now.
[00:22:04.778 --> 00:22:07.720]  I don't think they have that number one on their list.
[00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:20.044]  We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.
[00:22:24.744 --> 00:22:33.070]  And we believe in the right to self-defense, and the right to protect your family, your community, and your loved ones.
[00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:37.513]  We believe in the wisdom of our founders.
[00:22:38.254 --> 00:22:44.818]  And we believe in freedom and liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:46.740]  Aren't you glad we got him instead of Hillary?
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.621]  It's not perfect.
[00:22:48.741 --> 00:22:49.562]  You can't get it all done.
[00:22:49.622 --> 00:22:50.843]  He's not a dictator, but man.
[00:22:51.443 --> 00:22:51.944]  Night and day.
[00:22:53.084 --> 00:22:53.565]  Night and day.
[00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:56.831]  Democrats first denied the border crisis.
[00:22:56.991 --> 00:23:03.197]  We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life.
[00:23:04.658 --> 00:23:13.186]  And above all else, we know this, in America, we don't worship government, we worship God.
[00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:25.825]  They can't stand it.
[00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:29.226]  God above man, not man above man.
[00:23:30.767 --> 00:23:31.707]  Boy, they don't like this.
[00:23:32.707 --> 00:23:37.649]  Every day of my administration we are taking power out of Washington D.C.
[00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:41.890]  and returning it to the American people where it belongs.
[00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.731]  This is like the inauguration where he kept the promises.
[00:23:45.811 --> 00:23:51.973]  And you see it now better than ever with all of the resignations of bad apples.
[00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:52.913]  They're bad apples.
[00:23:54.431 --> 00:23:55.552]  They tried for a coup.
[00:23:55.672 --> 00:23:56.913]  Didn't work out so well.
[00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:06.779]  And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I?
[00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:15.564]  All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C.
[00:24:16.745 --> 00:24:17.505]  You've been watching.
[00:24:17.565 --> 00:24:18.346]  You've been seeing.
[00:24:19.807 --> 00:24:23.409]  You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible.
[00:24:25.194 --> 00:24:25.935]  In our country.
[00:24:26.735 --> 00:24:28.437]  Corruption at the highest level.
[00:24:29.077 --> 00:24:29.858]  A disgrace.
[00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:31.960]  Spying.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.601]  Surveillance.
[00:24:36.343 --> 00:24:37.584]  Trying for an overthrow.
[00:24:39.105 --> 00:24:39.866]  And we caught him.
[00:24:40.767 --> 00:24:41.347]  We caught him.
[00:24:41.487 --> 00:24:41.988]  We caught him.
[00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:45.370]  We caught your asses good.
[00:24:45.431 --> 00:24:47.612]  Who would have thought in our country?
[00:24:48.773 --> 00:24:50.975]  Yeah, that makes all the stuff they've done to me worth it.
[00:24:50.995 --> 00:24:51.736]  But it's called...
[00:24:53.154 --> 00:25:01.661]  What we all together have done started two and a half years ago on that great November 8th.
[00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:03.202]  That was a great day.
[00:25:03.222 --> 00:25:04.383]  Remember that day?
[00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:06.145]  Great day.
[00:25:08.066 --> 00:25:10.848]  And in a year and a half we have one called November 3rd.
[00:25:10.928 --> 00:25:12.410]  It's November 3rd this time.
[00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.231]  Get ready to vote.
[00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:14.912]  You better.
[00:25:16.573 --> 00:25:17.854]  You better get ready to vote.
[00:25:20.316 --> 00:25:22.598]  But it's all called draining the swamp
[00:25:23.462 --> 00:25:28.645]  And we are doing it faster than anyone ever thought possible.
[00:25:28.665 --> 00:25:29.446]  Very proud of that.
[00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:31.927]  See, folks, I know what he's doing.
[00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:35.109]  He's just saying, I delivered two years ago, and now the fight's about to start.
[00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:42.033]  And around the world, America is respected again because we are finally putting America first.
[00:25:43.274 --> 00:25:44.234]  Been a long time.
[00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:46.976]  He's declaring war on the dictator right now.
[00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:50.718]  Our time is now the hottest anywhere on the planet Earth.
[00:25:52.401 --> 00:26:07.991]  Just this morning, we learned that the GDP smashed expectations, with the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.2% in the first quarter.
[00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:12.193]  Always the worst quarter, for whatever reason.
[00:26:13.294 --> 00:26:16.196]  The Federal Reserve got slapped around, got back in line.
[00:26:19.562 --> 00:26:27.086]  And if we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing... We'd be at 5%.
[00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:35.770]  ...that the previous administration had, that 3.2 would have been much higher than that.
[00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:38.671]  But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years.
[00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:38.931]  Been 5%.
[00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:47.918]  A tremendous increase in inventory investment.
[00:26:47.938 --> 00:26:48.899]  You know what that means?
[00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:49.439]  Gearing up.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.683]  And, listen to this, a very big increase in net exports.
[00:26:54.763 --> 00:26:55.843]  Isn't it about time?
[00:26:55.903 --> 00:26:56.544]  Isn't that nice?
[00:26:58.685 --> 00:27:02.568]  We've added almost 6 million jobs since my election.
[00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:06.471]  And if I would have said that during the campaign,
[00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:11.434]  All of those people back there, we call them the fake news.
[00:27:12.074 --> 00:27:13.095]  They wouldn't have believed it.
[00:27:13.255 --> 00:27:13.835]  They're fake.
[00:27:14.535 --> 00:27:16.276]  And they're all plunging in their ratings even further.
[00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:17.877]  We're winning, they're losing.
[00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:21.279]  So lie and attack all you want, Lib Tards.
[00:27:21.499 --> 00:27:22.400]  We're beating you!
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.902]  At the fastest rate in more than three decades.
[00:27:27.462 --> 00:27:33.906]  Nearly five million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps since our election.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:49.108]  Wages are rising fast, and the lowest paid workers are making the biggest percentage gains of all, and that's nice to hear.
[00:27:49.128 --> 00:27:49.888]  It's about time.
[00:27:50.328 --> 00:27:51.269]  All right, we've got to go to break.
[00:27:51.309 --> 00:27:56.853]  This is live, but we're going to be able to back it up, and later in the second hour, I'm going to go to the rest of it.
[00:27:58.311 --> 00:27:59.512]  But we need to get on to the real war.
[00:27:59.712 --> 00:28:05.796]  They're going to put out fake polls like they did in 2016 to make it look like Trump's going to lose and to make it look like he's unpopular.
[00:28:06.437 --> 00:28:07.638]  They're doing it like I predicted.
[00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:09.799]  New dogs, old tricks.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.220]  Old dogs, new tricks.
[00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:12.161]  Same thing.
[00:28:12.201 --> 00:28:13.022]  New lies for old.
[00:28:13.422 --> 00:28:15.103]  Same people, same fraud, same scams.
[00:28:15.864 --> 00:28:17.185]  That's all coming up.
[00:28:18.646 --> 00:28:20.907]  How they're going to strike back, how they're going to undermine the economy.
[00:28:20.947 --> 00:28:22.128]  But Trump is fighting back.
[00:28:22.488 --> 00:28:23.609]  They've never experienced this.
[00:28:23.629 --> 00:28:25.631]  That's why they're losing on every front.
[00:28:27.082 --> 00:28:28.103]  It's still been Nip and Duck.
[00:28:29.443 --> 00:28:31.645]  And I'll say it again, you're the reason Trump got elected.
[00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:32.806]  He just said that.
[00:28:33.386 --> 00:28:34.827]  And InfoWars is seen by the enemy.
[00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:36.618]  Stocks and options.
[00:29:04.082 --> 00:29:10.826]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:29:11.427 --> 00:29:14.008]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:18.311]  And I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:29:18.831 --> 00:29:19.812]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:29:20.312 --> 00:29:26.336]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:29:26.797 --> 00:29:28.698]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:29.979]  I'm not the leader.
[00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:30.900]  You are the leader.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.681]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:37.806]  We've got giant specials running right now at FullWorthStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:45.933]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:29:45.953 --> 00:29:47.254]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:29:47.634 --> 00:29:48.535]  I want to encourage you again.
[00:29:49.036 --> 00:29:53.701]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:29:53.942 --> 00:29:56.705]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[00:29:57.106 --> 00:29:58.988]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:29:59.228 --> 00:29:59.689]  God bless you.
[00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:08.992]  Please remember that we're listener supported and wear your colors proud.
[00:30:09.052 --> 00:30:10.933]  They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[00:30:11.113 --> 00:30:12.434]  Supposed to end a day ago.
[00:30:12.514 --> 00:30:12.834]  It didn't.
[00:30:12.934 --> 00:30:13.475]  It's still there.
[00:30:13.495 --> 00:30:14.215]  Take advantage of it.
[00:30:14.415 --> 00:30:17.357]  Also, Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 25% off.

[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.961]  We got chill and we got raging.
[00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:25.322]  We've got it both right now at a great deal.
[00:30:25.342 --> 00:30:28.324]  Get Brain Force 25% off and get a free bottle of Knockout.
[00:30:28.644 --> 00:30:29.445]  We're good to go.
[00:30:43.635 --> 00:30:45.796]  They're both different formulas, but both very strong.
[00:30:45.936 --> 00:30:47.097]  Tell us which one you like the best.
[00:30:47.117 --> 00:30:51.659]  Get them both at half off, so you can experience both of them at half off, so you can see which one you like best.
[00:30:51.819 --> 00:30:52.639]  Or take them together.
[00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:55.020]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.601]  But whatever you do, take action!
[00:31:05.154 --> 00:31:06.095]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[00:31:23.283 --> 00:31:24.804]  This is a known patent out of France.
[00:31:24.824 --> 00:31:32.906]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[00:31:32.946 --> 00:31:35.687]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[00:31:52.952 --> 00:31:56.355]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:57.195]  It just works.
[00:31:57.235 --> 00:32:03.600]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms.
[00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:07.944]  And even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[00:32:07.984 --> 00:32:10.506]  Pollen block works every single time.
[00:32:10.606 --> 00:32:11.747]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[00:32:11.807 --> 00:32:15.170]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.492]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[00:32:17.572 --> 00:32:18.553]  It's very complex.
[00:32:18.573 --> 00:32:19.394]  They don't even know why.
[00:32:19.434 --> 00:32:22.757]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[00:32:23.317 --> 00:32:30.023]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[00:32:30.124 --> 00:32:31.825]  I go out and I do market research.
[00:32:31.965 --> 00:32:34.407]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[00:32:34.588 --> 00:32:35.949]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:44.397]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[00:32:44.417 --> 00:32:46.058]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[00:32:46.158 --> 00:32:51.363]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[00:32:51.904 --> 00:32:52.464]  It's not here.
[00:32:52.865 --> 00:32:56.308]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[00:32:56.388 --> 00:32:57.709]  M4WarStore.com or 888-253-3139er.
[00:33:05.965 --> 00:33:08.548]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:22.476]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:40.233]  President Trump is live at the NRA.
[00:33:40.273 --> 00:33:43.073]  We have live feeds up on InfoWars.com if you want to see that.
[00:33:43.513 --> 00:33:45.614]  We'll be playing more of it in the next hour.
[00:33:45.654 --> 00:33:51.935]  But I want to get to the historic interview he gave for the entire hour of Sean Hannity last night.
[00:33:51.955 --> 00:33:53.455]  We're going to air about 20 minutes of it.
[00:33:54.216 --> 00:34:01.477]  The full video is up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com titled, Attempted Coup.
[00:34:02.057 --> 00:34:05.118]  President Trump gives extensive interview to Sean Hannity.
[00:34:06.069 --> 00:34:07.389]  Now, why is this so important?
[00:34:07.409 --> 00:34:08.590]  They cover the waterfront.
[00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:18.693]  But the first 15 minutes or so, he gets into the deep state, the attempted coup, and the counter-strikes that are planned, and the fact that they are pushing for indictments and they have all the evidence.
[00:34:21.654 --> 00:34:25.776]  But I know they have the evidence because I was there researching and watching it all.
[00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:32.073]  In the last three years, we were the first show to say they were illegally spying on Trump.
[00:34:32.854 --> 00:34:37.257]  We then received NSA documents via the Drug Enforcement Agency.
[00:34:38.278 --> 00:34:39.118]  Exclusively.
[00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.440]  That's WikiLeaks-level stuff, folks.
[00:34:42.101 --> 00:34:43.462]  Protected by law, journalism.
[00:34:45.011 --> 00:34:49.295]  Where Trump and myself were being spied on by Obama right after he got into office.
[00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:53.639]  Our private numbers, everything we were saying, doing, we were given the index code.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.040]  That broke.
[00:34:55.141 --> 00:34:56.061]  Got zero attention.
[00:34:56.862 --> 00:34:58.964]  Other than Deep State demanding I be taken off air.
[00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:05.430]  And imagine how panicked they got as we knew exactly what they were doing and how they were doing it.
[00:35:05.951 --> 00:35:07.092]  But a lot of it was because
[00:35:10.552 --> 00:35:14.897]  Samantha Powers and others talked to the press and told them, don't worry, we know Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:35:15.257 --> 00:35:16.378]  We've been surveilling him.
[00:35:16.558 --> 00:35:20.903]  And then they reported that on CNN, MSNBC, and the New York Times.
[00:35:21.063 --> 00:35:22.444]  I played those clips yesterday.
[00:35:23.525 --> 00:35:25.187]  One American news was actually able to dig them out.
[00:35:25.327 --> 00:35:26.008]  I couldn't find them.
[00:35:26.048 --> 00:35:26.909]  I just remember it.
[00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.973]  And remember the New York Times article about Trump Tower Wiretapped?
[00:35:31.313 --> 00:35:32.254]  We know he's a Russian.
[00:35:32.595 --> 00:35:33.616]  On Inauguration Day.
[00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.692]  They put that out, that lie, that he was a Russian agent.
[00:35:39.292 --> 00:35:40.853]  The truth was they were surveilling him.
[00:35:40.953 --> 00:35:44.635]  Then they tried to walk it back and tried to claim that I'd made it up.
[00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:48.438]  But Trump covered this, first and foremost, with Hannity.
[00:35:49.078 --> 00:35:52.500]  But, again, he says, well, I'm going from memory, I guess it was a hunch.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:36:02.906]  No, Mr. President, I've never really revealed this on air, but in my first five or six conversations with the president, until one time he got irritated with it,
[00:36:04.895 --> 00:36:07.216]  And just said, let me just talk to your wife and wish you a happy wedding.
[00:36:08.057 --> 00:36:09.898]  I said, sir, you've got to go after them.
[00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:12.099]  They are not going to stop coming after you.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.381]  They have embeds, stay-behind networks inside the government.
[00:36:15.802 --> 00:36:21.525]  They have set up a Ministry of Truth with Defense Department money to target all the independent press and to shut us down.
[00:36:21.845 --> 00:36:22.846]  They are working against you.
[00:36:22.886 --> 00:36:23.627]  They have moles.
[00:36:23.987 --> 00:36:25.588]  He'd say, one moment, Alex, one moment.
[00:36:25.608 --> 00:36:27.709]  He'd come back and he goes, keep going, keep going.
[00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.311]  Trump would try to call up and pat me on the head.
[00:36:31.035 --> 00:36:35.496]  The last time I talked to him, I said, Mr. President, I don't need you to call up and thank me.
[00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:36.736]  Okay?
[00:36:37.657 --> 00:36:41.098]  I need you to defend yourself, and I need you to understand this is going on.
[00:36:41.458 --> 00:36:48.019]  Now, I know for a fact Hannity started telling him this a year and a half ago, to the point of six months ago, Trump was mad at Hannity.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.380]  Now they're back levied up.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.580]  But I'm not bragging here.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:57.482]  I need you to understand that I don't candy-ass around with the President when I get on the telephone with him.
[00:36:58.223 --> 00:36:58.483]  Okay?
[00:36:59.103 --> 00:37:02.585]  I'm not asking for jobs, or I'm not asking for myself to even be protected.
[00:37:04.005 --> 00:37:08.787]  I am simply telling the President, protect yourself, and don't believe these moles around you you're being lied to.
[00:37:09.428 --> 00:37:10.248]  Now it's all come out.
[00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:13.329]  Because I know what I'm talking about, and I have the sources.
[00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.710]  This is why they want me off air.
[00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.432]  So you're about to see Trump talk about who was first to warn him he was being spied on.
[00:37:19.912 --> 00:37:22.933]  But first, here's CNN attacking me for it, back in early 2017.
[00:37:25.455 --> 00:37:32.760]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.604]  And now, a few weeks later, the White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:37:38.664 --> 00:37:45.469]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right-wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right-wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:58.236]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then-candidate Trump, correct?
[00:37:58.816 --> 00:37:59.176]  Nothing.
[00:37:59.216 --> 00:38:01.538]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story.
[00:38:01.938 --> 00:38:03.319]  That we would be rushing it.
[00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:05.860]  I would not be sitting here with you, I'd be at home writing it and reporting it.
[00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:07.821]  Ball-faced lying.
[00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:09.122]  Show.
[00:38:10.714 --> 00:38:12.135]  That's why M4s have been targeted.
[00:38:12.155 --> 00:38:13.136]  That's why we've been put through hell.
[00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:14.256]  That's why they're trying to destroy us.
[00:38:14.757 --> 00:38:17.158]  It's because we have been loyal Americans and told the truth.
[00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:22.042]  And the last time I talked to the President, I said, I think you figured out you have to go after them.
[00:38:23.042 --> 00:38:24.743]  And I think you figured out they're never going to back down.
[00:38:25.944 --> 00:38:28.586]  And he said, no, I think you're right.
[00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:30.247]  I think you're right.
[00:38:31.468 --> 00:38:33.409]  And I said, sir, it's because you're better than them.
[00:38:33.509 --> 00:38:34.250]  You're self-made.
[00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.731]  They're from the political class.
[00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:37.132]  They're all dishonorable.
[00:38:37.172 --> 00:38:38.353]  They're all two-faced.
[00:38:39.246 --> 00:38:41.807]  You just have to understand you're not dealing in real estate anymore.
[00:38:42.728 --> 00:38:44.128]  He goes, I know, I know, Alex.
[00:38:44.148 --> 00:38:44.649]  We'll keep it up.
[00:38:44.909 --> 00:38:46.249]  We'll be talking a lot more soon.
[00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:48.570]  I don't care about being patted on the head.
[00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.012]  I said, Mr. President, you don't need to call me anymore.
[00:38:52.432 --> 00:38:57.095]  All you do is have your people watch my show and listen to my show when I do an emergency message to you.
[00:38:57.755 --> 00:38:58.615]  And I need you to watch him.
[00:38:59.216 --> 00:38:59.796]  He said he will.
[00:39:00.016 --> 00:39:00.476]  And he does.
[00:39:00.496 --> 00:39:03.918]  Why do you think I want to get rid of certain people in the White House?
[00:39:04.798 --> 00:39:05.759]  Certain people.
[00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:08.420]  Like Miller and others.
[00:39:10.854 --> 00:39:16.981]  And so that's why we're so targeted, because the president listens to us and he knows we've told him basically everything before anybody else did!
[00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:30.556]  I mean, I told him not to trust Kelly, and I told him not to trust Mattis, and man, I got threatened over that.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:39.384]  And they obviously have my phones tapped, because they have this one high-level CIA guy I call up, and they start getting really threatening, and I go, well, I haven't done anything.
[00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:40.885]  And he goes, you know what you've done.
[00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:45.288]  Getting rid of our command and control up there, so he can be out of control.
[00:39:45.528 --> 00:39:47.349]  Hey, he got elected, not you!
[00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:55.113]  And I've never been commissioned to be in the military, but the president told me, keep it up, press the attack, don't stop.
[00:39:55.354 --> 00:39:57.375]  Well, you know what, as long as he doesn't stop, I won't stop.
[00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:08.991]  That doesn't mean he's gotta be perfect, doesn't mean he has to have all the answers, but as long as he is an American president and tries to do the best interest of the country, I'm gonna back him to the hill, no matter how many threats or how much garbage or what goes on.
[00:40:09.511 --> 00:40:16.176]  And it feels so good and satisfying to go through all this hell and then to see the back being broken of the globalists.
[00:40:16.336 --> 00:40:16.977]  Can you hear it?
[00:40:17.277 --> 00:40:19.099]  Because their back's breaking right now.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.782]  We're busting their guts open right now.
[00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:26.685]  And it makes it really sweet to see victory.
[00:40:27.984 --> 00:40:33.446]  Coming into view, and to see the enemy bleeding out politically after what we've gone through, what you've gone through.
[00:40:33.927 --> 00:40:35.247]  And so, good job, listeners.
[00:40:37.008 --> 00:40:39.869]  You're in the arena when you spread the word about this broadcast.
[00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.871]  When you financially support us, and when you pray for us.
[00:40:43.131 --> 00:40:46.792]  You are the man and the woman in the arena, and I salute you!
[00:40:47.853 --> 00:40:48.853]  And I salute the President.
[00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:54.136]  Let's go ahead and go to the start of this, and I'm going to air it into the next hour, but it's very, very important.
[00:40:54.156 --> 00:40:55.536]  The full interview is up on Infowars.com.
[00:40:55.576 --> 00:40:57.297]  Here's Sean Hannity introducing the President last night.
[00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:04.895]  Alright, a lot of breaking news tonight, and you haven't really talked at length in an interview about a lot of issues.
[00:41:05.255 --> 00:41:07.277]  Let me start with this issue of the Ukraine.
[00:41:07.297 --> 00:41:15.983]  I don't know if you were following the top of the show or John Solomon's new report, or that both Catherine Herridge and Sarah Carter are reporting tonight.
[00:41:16.083 --> 00:41:25.210]  We now have text messages from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, never before seen, discussing recruiting White House sources to spy on you.
[00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.751]  Take it in any order you'd like.
[00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:31.364]  Well, I think it's incredible when you hear it.
[00:41:31.404 --> 00:41:36.027]  These are great reporters, all three, and when you have them on your trail, that's a problem.
[00:41:36.087 --> 00:41:42.030]  These are people that should be getting Pulitzers, not the ones that got the Pulitzers that got everything wrong.
[00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.951]  If you listen to them, they got everything wrong.
[00:41:44.011 --> 00:41:47.253]  Go back and read some of their early and mid-articles.
[00:41:47.814 --> 00:41:50.916]  They didn't have a clue what was going on, and they win Pulitzer Prizes.
[00:41:50.956 --> 00:41:52.377]  The only one that should be winning.
[00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:56.019]  The woman that won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Trump is the same pig.
[00:41:57.093 --> 00:42:00.034]  That has other reporters stalking me and writing fake articles about me.
[00:42:00.294 --> 00:42:01.434]  She's a dumb pig.
[00:42:01.754 --> 00:42:02.574]  She can hardly talk.
[00:42:02.654 --> 00:42:03.494]  Let's go back to the President.
[00:42:04.615 --> 00:42:05.855]  It sounds like big stuff.
[00:42:06.135 --> 00:42:10.156]  It sounds like very interesting with Ukraine.
[00:42:10.356 --> 00:42:13.057]  I love how Trump acts like, oh I think this is going to be coming out.
[00:42:13.077 --> 00:42:13.977]  I think that's going to be coming out.
[00:42:14.197 --> 00:42:15.037]  He has it all.
[00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:16.017]  All the cards.
[00:42:16.097 --> 00:42:16.677]  All the crimes.
[00:42:16.837 --> 00:42:18.258]  It's much worse than you've been told.
[00:42:18.538 --> 00:42:18.878]  Continue.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:27.685]  President a little while ago, two days ago, and congratulated him on an incredible race, incredible run, a big surprise victory.
[00:42:27.705 --> 00:42:28.725]  Got 75% of the vote.
[00:42:30.843 --> 00:42:33.505]  But that sounds like big, big stuff.
[00:42:33.565 --> 00:42:34.426]  I'm not surprised.
[00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:39.170]  Mr. President, Ukraine is offering this evidence to the United States.
[00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:45.755]  Would you like the United States, with all this talk about... We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:46.315 --> 00:42:49.477]  As if Trump needs the evidence from the Ukraine, he has it all.
[00:42:49.878 --> 00:42:53.340]  He's waiting for the Democrats to dig their hole deeper before he...
[00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:56.102]  Shovels the gravel in on top their heads.
[00:42:56.622 --> 00:43:12.066]  We'll be right back in four words calm next year's news today Brainforce plus is a top tier nootropic focus Clarity energy, but instead of having a seven times markup.

[00:44:42.899 --> 00:44:44.361]  Alright, I'll give it a try.

[00:45:01.775 --> 00:45:02.515]  Maybe this will help.
[00:45:03.556 --> 00:45:04.416]  Alpha Power, huh?

[00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.511]  We have to stop the sales.
[00:46:08.531 --> 00:46:09.652]  A lot of them have almost sold out.

[00:46:21.197 --> 00:46:22.258]  Mean like a Wolverine.
[00:46:22.518 --> 00:46:23.058]  All there.

[00:46:28.721 --> 00:46:31.042]  And I'm wearing InfoWars Resist Tyranny shirt.
[00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.103]  It's one of my favorites.
[00:46:32.763 --> 00:46:36.266]  And if you're a radio listener, it has InfoWars classic lettering at the top.
[00:46:36.426 --> 00:46:41.289]  It's got a shield with the InfoWars crest with the snake of the states joining together.
[00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:42.550]  It says, Resist Tyranny.
[00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:44.471]  And it is a very, very nice shirt.
[00:46:44.531 --> 00:46:46.052]  Great way to trigger libtards.
[00:46:46.112 --> 00:46:47.313]  Great way to spread free speech.
[00:46:47.353 --> 00:46:49.634]  Great way to meet friends and folks you didn't know.
[00:46:49.735 --> 00:46:51.296]  Gotta wear your colors loud and proud.
[00:46:51.396 --> 00:46:53.517]  There's another big special on the side as well.
[00:46:53.597 --> 00:46:54.658]  Get a bottle of Brain Force.

[00:46:58.901 --> 00:47:00.061]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:47:00.181 --> 00:47:00.302]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.573]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.936 --> 00:47:30.039]  Coming up, folks, Eric Bolling has launched a syndicated show on Sinclair.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:38.326]  It's got more viewers than Fox, and it's set very soon to be on even more, and with a bunch of other really good people.
[00:47:39.087 --> 00:47:46.974]  And so I've been getting to become really good friends with Eric, and we had our combative interview in here about a year ago, but I did a big, extensive interview with him in D.C.
[00:47:47.654 --> 00:47:53.619]  We're going to premiere that interview that's never before been seen, and then air some of the interview I did with him for his TV show.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.022]  So that's part of the third hour today.
[00:47:57.042 --> 00:47:59.023]  I just think we had Max Keiser for you.
[00:47:59.043 --> 00:47:59.824]  This is not filler.
[00:47:59.864 --> 00:48:01.045]  These are really good interviews.
[00:48:01.065 --> 00:48:05.648]  I don't normally air the interviews I put, you know, just on the internet during the show, but these are powerful.
[00:48:06.128 --> 00:48:06.909]  So that's coming up.
[00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:12.993]  We'll also put the phones up in the second half of the next hour, into that next hour as well.
[00:48:13.794 --> 00:48:20.239]  But let's, without me talking anymore, let's start getting into the first 20 minutes of Trump on Sean Hannity last night.
[00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:23.870]  Mr. President, the Ukraine is offering this evidence to the United States.
[00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:24.271]  Would you like
[00:48:49.338 --> 00:48:51.860]  The United States, all this talk about collusion.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.644]  They're saying they colluded on behalf of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.
[00:48:57.525 --> 00:49:03.870]  Does America need to see that information, especially in light of all the attacks against you on collusion?
[00:49:04.831 --> 00:49:05.711]  Well, I think we do.
[00:49:05.851 --> 00:49:11.376]  And frankly, we have a great new Attorney General who's done an unbelievable job in a very short period of time.
[00:49:12.598 --> 00:49:18.764]  And he's very smart, and he's very tough, and I would certainly defer to him, but I would imagine he'd want to see this.
[00:49:19.004 --> 00:49:23.789]  People have been saying this whole concept of Ukraine.
[00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:25.931]  They've been talking about it, actually, for a long time.
[00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:26.611]  You know that.
[00:49:27.072 --> 00:49:32.677]  And I would certainly defer to the Attorney General, and we'll see what he says about it.
[00:49:32.697 --> 00:49:33.698]  He calls them straight.
[00:49:33.758 --> 00:49:34.879]  That's one thing I can tell you.
[00:49:35.796 --> 00:49:41.240]  Mr. President, our own Catherine Herridge, investigative reporter Sarah Carter, big breaking news tonight.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:47.904]  Senate Republican chairman submitted a letter Thursday to the Department of Justice, the Attorney General.
[00:49:48.324 --> 00:50:05.196]  We have new texts from November of 2016 from Strzok and Page showing the pair had discussed attempts to recruit sources from within your White House to spy on your administration and reveal that they had one particular contact within the White House
[00:50:05.876 --> 00:50:12.760]  The Vice President's Chief of Staff, whose wife was working as an analyst, was struck on the FBI investigation into Hillary's private server.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.181]  Have you heard this report tonight, sir?
[00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:21.410]  I just heard it a little while ago and frankly it's very disconcerting.
[00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:32.436]  If you look at what's been happening, they were the same two, the two lovers that decided to use the FBI server instead of their private so they didn't get caught.
[00:50:33.537 --> 00:50:36.739]  These two were beauties, there's no doubt about it.
[00:50:36.799 --> 00:50:40.661]  They were going hog wild to find something about the administration.
[00:50:41.537 --> 00:50:42.738]  Which obviously wasn't there.
[00:50:42.778 --> 00:50:47.880]  We have nothing to do with Russia, except that we've been tougher on Russia than any administration in 50 years.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.121]  A lot tougher than Obama.
[00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:56.524]  But these were the two that talked about the insurance policy, just in case Hillary Clinton loses.
[00:50:56.684 --> 00:50:59.766]  If she loses, we've got an insurance policy.
[00:50:59.826 --> 00:51:01.727]  Well, that was the insurance policy.
[00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:02.587]  Now she lost.
[00:51:03.287 --> 00:51:06.449]  And now they're trying to infiltrate the administration
[00:51:07.169 --> 00:51:07.590]  I don't know.
[00:51:27.448 --> 00:51:30.210]  I've never seen anything like a blow-up like you've never seen.
[00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:45.879]  Now I understand why, because they thought two years ago when I said that, just on a little bit of a hunch and a little bit of wisdom maybe, it blew up because they thought maybe I was wise to them or they were caught.
[00:51:46.579 --> 00:51:50.261]  And that's why, because if they weren't doing anything wrong, it would have just gotten by.
[00:51:50.281 --> 00:51:51.442]  Nobody would have cared about it.
[00:51:51.462 --> 00:51:52.663]  It was pretty insignificant.
[00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:54.484]  I thought when I said it,
[00:51:55.567 --> 00:51:57.930]  And it's pretty amazing.
[00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:01.794]  So you see now they're trying to infiltrate the White House.
[00:52:01.854 --> 00:52:03.315]  This is long after the election.
[00:52:03.375 --> 00:52:04.136]  It's a disgrace.
[00:52:04.817 --> 00:52:08.821]  And again, hopefully the Attorney General will do what's right.
[00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:10.002]  And I really believe he will.
[00:52:10.825 --> 00:52:16.427]  Mr. President, the Attorney General actually used the word spying on your campaign.
[00:52:16.468 --> 00:52:24.451]  We know of Stefan Halper and his contacts that he made with Papadopoulos and Carter Page and Sam Clovis.
[00:52:25.511 --> 00:52:30.954]  We know about the FISA warrant, as the Grassley-Graham memo said, the bulk of information.
[00:52:31.254 --> 00:52:37.039]  Well, I think they made many attempts, and then you see the lying, and you see the leaking, and you see Comey lie to Congress, nothing happens.
[00:52:57.228 --> 00:52:59.170]  You see him leaking, nothing happens.
[00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.172]  And this is leaking classified information.
[00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:04.014]  This is leaking really big stuff.
[00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:06.076]  I remember the young sailor.
[00:53:06.376 --> 00:53:10.579]  In fact, I helped him out with his family because I feel unfairly treated, as you know.
[00:53:10.659 --> 00:53:17.665]  But I remember he had confidential information, which is a much, much lower standard than classified.
[00:53:18.566 --> 00:53:21.548]  And they put him in jail for a long time.
[00:53:21.609 --> 00:53:23.050]  They took away his life.
[00:53:23.995 --> 00:53:39.922]  And then you look at what Hillary Clinton did with 33,000 emails and hundreds of thousands of text messages or emails going through the Wiener server or computer, hundreds of thousands of which many were classified.
[00:53:40.523 --> 00:53:41.763]  And nothing happens to her.
[00:53:41.803 --> 00:53:47.986]  And yet they put a young sailor on for doing something innocent, showing his mother and his friend what the desk looked like.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.523]  The desk in a 40-year-old submarine.
[00:53:50.583 --> 00:53:54.309]  I think Russia and China would have had that picture many years ago.
[00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.194]  So it's really a double standard like you've never seen.
[00:53:57.254 --> 00:53:58.216]  Very, very unfair.
[00:53:58.256 --> 00:54:00.059]  But hopefully that will change.
[00:54:00.139 --> 00:54:01.361]  I think that will be changing.
[00:54:01.874 --> 00:54:11.816]  Mr. President, closed-door testimony recently revealed, struck and paged, that they were laughing at the idea that the Hillary investigation was a real investigation.
[00:54:12.897 --> 00:54:20.919]  And that it went directly into Loretta Lynch's office, which now raises a whole new set of other questions.
[00:54:20.959 --> 00:54:22.299]  And they were confident about that.
[00:54:22.939 --> 00:54:29.361]  And it was struck that the interview with Hillary, uncharacteristically, frankly unprecedented, allowed two other people in that interview.
[00:54:30.141 --> 00:54:32.664]  Uh, while she was being interviewed in an investigation.
[00:54:32.764 --> 00:54:37.728]  Comey, of course, exonerated her, but he even acknowledged top secret classified information on that server.
[00:54:38.249 --> 00:54:39.770]  I did disagree with you at the time.
[00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:45.936]  You, after the election, were basically saying, let bygones be bygones, let's not go down this road.
[00:54:47.954 --> 00:54:50.876]  And this is what I told the President over and over as well.
[00:54:51.517 --> 00:54:53.959]  Because at one level they were saying, OK, we're going to leave you alone.
[00:54:53.999 --> 00:54:54.899]  We know you've got us.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.842]  But behind the scenes they were trying to undermine, trying to have a coup, lying to Congress.
[00:54:59.323 --> 00:55:01.164]  That's why they can't just be allowed to run around.
[00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:04.547]  I get going after the globalists could trigger them to stage something even bigger.
[00:55:04.987 --> 00:55:05.607]  It doesn't matter.
[00:55:05.627 --> 00:55:07.048]  You can't let these criminals run free.
[00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:08.269]  They're out of control.
[00:55:08.289 --> 00:55:08.870]  They're arrogant.
[00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:11.232]  Hillary's on the news this week saying, arrest Trump.
[00:55:11.952 --> 00:55:14.814]  With all the dirt on her, and Lynch, and all of them.
[00:55:15.314 --> 00:55:16.755]  It's all up on NewsWars.com.
[00:55:17.295 --> 00:55:19.316]  We've been literally the first to break all this down.
[00:55:19.976 --> 00:55:22.158]  I keep going back to that because it makes us a target.
[00:55:22.398 --> 00:55:24.079]  So I want to commend the listeners for your support.
[00:55:24.399 --> 00:55:25.819]  What you've done has changed history.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.520]  You should really feel good about it.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.622]  But understand, there's more rounds left in this fight.
[00:55:30.962 --> 00:55:32.043]  Let's go back to more of the President.
[00:55:33.118 --> 00:55:54.589]  Do you regret saying that, and do you think now, if we really are to get to the bottom and the truth, it has to also include Hillary Clinton, the email server, which would be an underlying crime and obstruction, which everyone in the media seems to care about, the intent behind the 33,000 subpoenaed emails deleted, bleach bit, hammers, SIM cards.
[00:55:56.579 --> 00:55:57.920]  No, I don't regret saying it.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.401]  When I won, they were all saying, lock her up, lock her up.
[00:56:01.961 --> 00:56:04.022]  And I said, no, no, let's get on with life.
[00:56:04.102 --> 00:56:04.803]  That was different.
[00:56:04.863 --> 00:56:10.125]  It was like right after the election, you want to get a new page and turn over a new leaf.
[00:56:10.265 --> 00:56:12.246]  And I said, let's get on with it.
[00:56:12.306 --> 00:56:15.768]  Let's, you know, build up the economy, which, by the way, is doing record business.
[00:56:15.788 --> 00:56:17.028]  I'm so proud of the economy.
[00:56:17.068 --> 00:56:18.329]  We're doing numbers that nobody's
[00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.289]  I think so.
[00:56:32.071 --> 00:56:40.081]  Fairly shortly after that great evening, they started coming at us with the insurance policy, and everything they did was so dishonest.
[00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:48.211]  And then we really started looking into a lot of things like her deleted emails and acid-washed emails.
[00:56:49.232 --> 00:56:50.293]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:52.774]  Then Trump says, but now they need to be criminally charged.
[00:56:52.814 --> 00:56:54.674]  Now I believe the Attorney General is going to go after them.
[00:56:54.895 --> 00:56:55.635]  They need to go to jail.
[00:56:55.955 --> 00:56:58.876]  And that's the big enchilada we're coming up with next.
[00:56:59.377 --> 00:57:04.099]  Then I'll get into all the other news, and there's a lot of it, and then take your phone calls straight ahead.
[00:57:04.139 --> 00:57:07.580]  And the Eric Bolling exclusive interview coming up here as well.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.721]  Please don't forget!

[00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.770]  Stay with us.
[00:57:52.927 --> 00:58:01.812]  Globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[00:58:02.273 --> 00:58:11.738]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels or oligopolies.
[00:58:12.078 --> 00:58:16.241]  Groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[00:58:16.761 --> 00:58:19.762]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[00:58:20.182 --> 00:58:30.146]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[00:58:30.747 --> 00:58:34.408]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[00:58:34.828 --> 00:58:36.689]  And that's why the globalists who were arrogant
[00:58:36.869 --> 00:58:37.049]  I think?
[00:58:52.423 --> 00:58:55.806]  The modern Paul Revere transmission of this republic.
[00:58:56.287 --> 00:59:11.621]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching or listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated and this restoration of the republic could be defeated.
[00:59:12.001 --> 00:59:16.886]  So please keep spreading the word and whatever you do, remember we're only financed now by you.

[01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:10.958]  Think of the Arabs.
[01:00:10.978 --> 01:00:13.959]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:14.419 --> 01:00:20.141]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:27.343]  Hillary has committed decades and decades of crimes, believing she was above the law because she was protected by the power structure.
[01:00:27.383 --> 01:00:28.944]  She was at the top of it.
[01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:32.385]  And now, on Monday, she comes out and shoots her mouth off.
[01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:39.497]  And says the president should be arrested for obstruction when she's the queen of obstruction with Loretta Lynch and others.
[01:00:40.298 --> 01:00:40.819]  Here she is.
[01:00:42.034 --> 01:00:53.180]  There's enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted.
[01:00:53.861 --> 01:01:00.665]  The whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress.
[01:01:00.685 --> 01:01:04.187]  I mean, if you read that part of the report, it could not be clearer.
[01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:06.136]  Really?
[01:01:06.476 --> 01:01:12.318]  Okay, so let's go back to the President and the 45-minute out-of-the-park interview where he gets into every issue.
[01:01:12.338 --> 01:01:14.898]  Let's continue with the President.
[01:01:15.899 --> 01:01:21.520]  They started coming at us with the insurance policy and everything they did was so dishonest.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:32.263]  And then we really started looking into a lot of things like her deleted emails and acid-washed emails, which is unheard of because of the expense of doing it.
[01:01:33.275 --> 01:01:38.376]  And how she got away with it, how her lawyer got away with it, how all of these things happened.
[01:01:38.396 --> 01:01:42.257]  Don't forget, when they interviewed her, that was on July 4th weekend.
[01:01:43.097 --> 01:01:46.878]  It was very, very late into the July 4th weekend.
[01:01:47.598 --> 01:01:48.819]  They asked her questions.
[01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:50.219]  They didn't have a stenographer.
[01:01:50.259 --> 01:01:52.160]  They didn't have anybody swear her in.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.120]  They didn't have a tape recorder.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.421]  They just walked in, asked her some questions, and that was fine.
[01:01:58.861 --> 01:02:02.362]  In the meantime, look at what she's done, how she's destroyed the lives of people
[01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:04.838]  That were on our campaign.
[01:02:04.918 --> 01:02:07.059]  She's destroyed their lives and the DNC.
[01:02:08.039 --> 01:02:14.060]  And frankly, when the FBI went into the DNC, the DNC told them to get the hell out of here.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.420]  Think of that.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.161]  They told that to the FBI and they wouldn't give them the server.
[01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:21.181]  I want to find out what's on that server, the DNC server.
[01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:22.961]  Because that's the big thing.
[01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:24.462]  Nobody's seen that server yet.
[01:02:24.482 --> 01:02:25.622]  The FBI didn't see it.
[01:02:26.422 --> 01:02:31.543]  And these are the top people at the FBI where you had absolute dirty cops.
[01:02:32.463 --> 01:02:33.705]  These were dirty cops.
[01:02:34.106 --> 01:02:38.432]  Now, the FBI, I know FBI guys, these are the best in the world.
[01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:41.637]  But the people leading it, Comey and McCabe...
[01:02:42.609 --> 01:02:43.710]  No, stay right here.
[01:03:05.311 --> 01:03:06.452]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[01:03:06.472 --> 01:03:08.513]  I'm going to come back and finish up with the part I'm going to play.
[01:03:08.533 --> 01:03:10.695]  And if we have time later, I'll play more.
[01:03:10.715 --> 01:03:24.524]  But something hit me while I was watching this just now that we all know, but that has to be stated very clearly, not just to ourselves and to others, because we're in an information war, but to the president.
[01:03:25.605 --> 01:03:27.827]  Because he gets distracted with a million things.
[01:03:28.747 --> 01:03:29.828]  And he's tough.
[01:03:30.668 --> 01:03:34.111]  And so he'll tend to be a little overconfident sometimes.
[01:03:35.598 --> 01:03:40.940]  I want to explain something when we come back that is a paramount to all of this.
[01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:48.584]  Because we think of it as there's Trump and there's the Democrats and then there's special interests.
[01:03:50.825 --> 01:03:52.326]  But that's not really what's going on here.
[01:03:52.706 --> 01:03:58.248]  That's only half the equation.
[01:03:59.229 --> 01:03:59.889]  Maybe less.
[01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:00.810]  Maybe 40% of the equation.
[01:04:04.525 --> 01:04:12.307]  So when we come back, the secret to defeating the Deep State, why they want us off air, is that I have studied history.
[01:04:13.428 --> 01:04:18.889]  Worldwide, in-depth, literally read probably, I don't want to exaggerate, 500 books on history alone.
[01:04:19.569 --> 01:04:21.590]  And I know how these systems operate.
[01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:27.672]  And it's not just Republicans or Democrats.
[01:04:28.672 --> 01:04:29.792]  It's not just foreign powers.
[01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:31.813]  It's not just special interests.
[01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.364]  I think a lot of you are smarter than I am, you probably know.
[01:04:35.384 --> 01:04:39.007]  I'm gonna lay it out, though, when we come back.
[01:04:39.027 --> 01:04:41.008]  On the other side.
[01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.953]  You may fire at will, Commander.
[01:04:47.334 --> 01:04:48.995]  Do what must be done.
[01:04:49.956 --> 01:04:50.617]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:51.477]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:51.497 --> 01:04:59.524]  Tomorrow's news today, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and Paul Watson's new site, Summit.News.
[01:04:59.964 --> 01:05:01.045]  He's running the show over there.
[01:05:01.085 --> 01:05:01.606]  It's his site.
[01:05:07.928 --> 01:05:11.829]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:14.069]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:14.889]  Good to talk to you.
[01:05:15.209 --> 01:05:19.390]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:21.351]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:25.852]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:27.952]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:05:28.032 --> 01:05:32.373]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[01:05:32.434 --> 01:05:33.934]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:05:33.974 --> 01:05:34.474]  Tell us about it.
[01:05:34.534 --> 01:05:35.234]  Well, it's really great.
[01:05:35.254 --> 01:05:36.455]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:05:36.495 --> 01:05:36.935]  I take it.
[01:05:36.995 --> 01:05:37.615]  It tastes good.
[01:05:37.675 --> 01:05:39.376]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.137]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:05:41.277 --> 01:05:43.718]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[01:05:43.778 --> 01:05:44.578]  So I really like it.
[01:05:44.598 --> 01:05:47.280]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.860]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.861]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:05:50.961 --> 01:05:51.441]  So, yeah.
[01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:53.682]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[01:05:54.142 --> 01:05:56.463]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[01:05:56.824 --> 01:05:57.744]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:05:57.904 --> 01:05:59.645]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:12.439]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:15.001 --> 01:06:18.985]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:26.511 --> 01:06:35.038]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.016 --> 01:06:44.020]  And frankly, when the FBI went into the DNC, the DNC told them to get the hell out of here.
[01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:45.361]  Think of that.
[01:06:45.681 --> 01:06:48.103]  They told that to the FBI and they wouldn't give them the server.
[01:06:48.403 --> 01:06:51.145]  I want to find out what's on that server, the DNC server.
[01:06:51.805 --> 01:06:52.906]  Because that's the big thing.
[01:06:52.986 --> 01:06:54.427]  Nobody's seen that server yet.
[01:06:54.447 --> 01:06:55.588]  The FBI didn't see it.
[01:06:56.368 --> 01:07:01.492]  And these are the top people at the FBI where you had absolute dirty cops.
[01:07:02.412 --> 01:07:03.654]  These were dirty cops.
[01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:08.383]  Now, the FBI, I know FBI guys, these are the best in the world.
[01:07:08.904 --> 01:07:11.589]  But the people leading it, Comey and McCabe...
[01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:18.986]  And Strzok and Page and all of these people, the lawyer who admitted, frankly, how crooked things were.
[01:07:19.006 --> 01:07:22.729]  I mean, when that testimony comes out, it's already come out partially.
[01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:26.772]  When that testimony comes out from the attorney for the FBI, you'll see.
[01:07:27.533 --> 01:07:30.996]  So I really say now we have to get down because this was a coup.
[01:07:31.016 --> 01:07:35.759]  This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government.
[01:07:35.839 --> 01:07:37.681]  We had people coming out to vote
[01:07:38.453 --> 01:07:41.914]  From all over this country that are in love with what we're doing.
[01:07:42.414 --> 01:07:43.974]  It's called Make America Great Again.
[01:07:44.014 --> 01:07:45.515]  That's what we've done and we're doing.
[01:07:46.475 --> 01:07:49.576]  And this was an overthrow and it's a disgraceful thing.
[01:07:49.656 --> 01:07:52.616]  And I don't I think it's far bigger than Watergate.
[01:07:53.257 --> 01:07:57.698]  I think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this country.
[01:07:58.058 --> 01:07:59.238]  Maybe beyond political.
[01:08:00.018 --> 01:08:03.739]  So I think that a lot of things are being learned right now just like you just
[01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:08.645]  Mentioned just a few moments ago, again with Strzok and Page.
[01:08:08.665 --> 01:08:09.586]  These are sick people.
[01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:11.287]  These are sick, sick people.
[01:08:11.748 --> 01:08:16.131]  So let's see what happens with McCabe and Comey and Brennan and Clapper.
[01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:17.192]  They weren't in the act.
[01:08:18.052 --> 01:08:25.838]  And let's see what happens and let's see how high it goes up because it's inconceivable when it goes to Clapper, Brennan, Comey, these people.
[01:08:26.639 --> 01:08:31.943]  I would imagine that some other people, maybe a little bit higher up, also knew about it and maybe a lot higher up.
[01:08:32.203 --> 01:08:32.443]  All right.
[01:08:33.865 --> 01:08:34.966]  We'll go back to that in a moment.
[01:08:35.046 --> 01:08:42.691]  I don't normally air 10-15 minutes of somebody else's show, but Sean Hannity's doing a great job, and he had the President on, laying out exactly what I told you.
[01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:43.652]  I just got back from D.C.
[01:08:43.692 --> 01:08:45.633]  yesterday at like 10 in the morning.
[01:08:46.554 --> 01:08:52.217]  I laid out that I met with three people, high-level, that had personally met with the President.
[01:08:52.277 --> 01:08:56.140]  Two of them personally met, one of them talked to him, and he said, I'm taking the gloves off.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.361]  We know Obama and Hillary are behind it.
[01:08:58.422 --> 01:08:59.102]  They have all the proof.
[01:08:59.122 --> 01:09:00.183]  They have all the documents.
[01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:09.982]  But they are going to sit there and just lay it out slowly, let the Democrats lie, and catch them in even bigger frauds.
[01:09:11.144 --> 01:09:12.546]  Because you already have Clapper and Brennan.
[01:09:13.127 --> 01:09:15.910]  Three weeks ago, I played the clips for a whole week, every day.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.000]  Then we should think about planning again.
[01:09:18.761 --> 01:09:27.263]  Clapper and Brennan, especially Brennan, he's the real mastermind, ran up on television on CNN, MSNBC, and said, we're not getting in trouble.
[01:09:27.443 --> 01:09:30.124]  I'm not worried about being indicted for illegally spying on Trump.
[01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:32.085]  I was ordered to by Obama.
[01:09:33.505 --> 01:09:34.085]  Still illegal.
[01:09:34.886 --> 01:09:36.906]  Then you lied to Congress after Obama was out of office.
[01:09:37.026 --> 01:09:41.247]  You are done if Trump pulls the political trigger.
[01:09:41.808 --> 01:09:42.268]  And guess what?
[01:09:42.448 --> 01:09:43.848]  He's already pulled it, jackass.
[01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:45.929]  In fact, that's the big announcement here.
[01:09:47.113 --> 01:09:50.815]  The trigger was already pulled before Hillary went and ran her mouth about arresting Trump last week.
[01:09:51.155 --> 01:09:52.016]  But it's done, lady.
[01:09:53.016 --> 01:09:58.179]  So, everybody needs to have their eyes peeled, though, for dirty tricks they might pull to try to derail this.
[01:09:58.699 --> 01:10:00.660]  Because they are definitely scared right now.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.662]  Now, let me get to the thing, though, that is the wild card here.
[01:10:07.323 --> 01:10:10.545]  A lot of people think, well, there's the Republican Party and there's the Democrat Party.
[01:10:11.744 --> 01:10:21.287]  And then there's the legislative that's made up of the two parties, and then you've got, of course, the executive that's the president, then you've got the judiciary that's the courts.
[01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:28.749]  And Trump's got a lot of the governors, and he's got the Senate, and he's got the executive, but we don't have the House.
[01:10:29.329 --> 01:10:37.291]  And you look at it, you think of the election coming up as if Bernie Sanders or somebody like Biden are battling for control of the Democratic Party.
[01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:41.779]  Hillary Clinton and the globalists are still in control.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.082]  MoveOn.org, George Soros, they still call the shots.
[01:10:45.683 --> 01:10:47.124]  And that's why Hillary's so arrogant.
[01:10:48.025 --> 01:10:50.588]  And that's why they're pushing Joe Biden, because he's part of that combine.
[01:10:52.441 --> 01:11:00.264]  So Trump has to go ahead and prosecute Hillary because just that happening will make everybody roll over on her and her cohorts.
[01:11:00.964 --> 01:11:07.206]  But if that doesn't happen, she can still arrogantly sit there and threaten her minions in the FBI, the CIA.
[01:11:07.446 --> 01:11:09.167]  She doesn't control all of them, but key people.
[01:11:09.923 --> 01:11:11.564]  They've been stacking the deck for a long time.
[01:11:11.764 --> 01:11:13.345]  They've been putting their moles in there for a long time.
[01:11:13.785 --> 01:11:22.331]  She's got to put that confidence game on so that all these mutinous individuals inside the government keep following their orders to sabotage the country.
[01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:27.434]  But Trump talks about in the interview the record number of people resigning.
[01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:28.115]  He likes that.
[01:11:28.971 --> 01:11:29.992]  They're getting out now.
[01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:36.540]  You go back a year ago, two years ago, Brennan, Clapper, others, Mudd, they would all say, hang on.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:40.845]  Comey said, if you're in the government, stay there and fight this president.
[01:11:41.666 --> 01:11:43.648]  Don't do what he says in the executive.
[01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:46.612]  Basically engage in espionage.
[01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:48.855]  But suddenly you see the mayor of
[01:11:51.584 --> 01:11:52.545]  Baltimore being arrested.
[01:11:52.605 --> 01:11:54.406]  Suddenly you see all these other Democrats being arrested.
[01:11:54.666 --> 01:12:00.951]  Suddenly you see federal judges that are letting illegal aliens go, that are getting money from Democrat groups that get money from illegal aliens.
[01:12:01.251 --> 01:12:02.072]  They're being arrested.
[01:12:04.056 --> 01:12:05.637]  Because it's criminal what they're doing.
[01:12:06.277 --> 01:12:17.862]  So the gloves are off, and you're gonna see Trump, because he's exercising rightful power, not a usurpation of power, not a power grab, but a real defense, you're going to see massive arrests.
[01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:18.623]  They're beginning.
[01:12:19.563 --> 01:12:20.704]  The roll-up has begun.
[01:12:20.964 --> 01:12:22.184]  The grand juries are open.
[01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:23.785]  I'll say this, too.
[01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:27.267]  I've been around 24 years.
[01:12:27.987 --> 01:12:31.569]  President Trump came on my show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:34.428]  No one knows who QAnon is.
[01:12:34.548 --> 01:12:36.228]  It's a bunch of people on 4chan and 8chan.
[01:12:36.929 --> 01:12:37.849]  It says some good things.
[01:12:37.909 --> 01:12:38.909]  It says some bad things.
[01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:47.292]  But even after I've tried to be nice to 4chan and 8chan and the whole Q thing, it comes out and says Jones is a Zionist shill.
[01:12:47.332 --> 01:12:48.213]  He's going to get arrested.
[01:12:48.493 --> 01:12:49.073]  All this crap.
[01:12:49.593 --> 01:12:52.694]  Trump's daughter is married to an Orthodox Jew.
[01:12:53.074 --> 01:12:54.015]  Trump is pro-Israel.
[01:12:54.075 --> 01:12:56.756]  But you guys don't attack him because he's too big a target.
[01:12:57.236 --> 01:12:59.517]  But see that paradox of Q becoming anti-Semitic?
[01:12:59.657 --> 01:13:05.159]  That's not the real Q. If Q was ever real, we don't need a bunch of anti-Semitic crap, a bunch of anti-Israel stuff.
[01:13:05.299 --> 01:13:06.039]  That's a diversion.
[01:13:06.319 --> 01:13:07.620]  The Chi-Coms are the issue.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:08.880]  The EU's the issue.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.141]  The UN collapsing our border's the issue.
[01:13:11.901 --> 01:13:13.222]  Are there some bad Jews in the world?
[01:13:13.262 --> 01:13:13.802]  Damn right!
[01:13:14.002 --> 01:13:15.002]  There's some bad everything.
[01:13:15.362 --> 01:13:16.323]  I don't work for Israel.
[01:13:16.523 --> 01:13:17.563]  I'm not paid by Israel.
[01:13:17.743 --> 01:13:19.504]  I get attacked by a lot of the Jewish lobby.
[01:13:20.558 --> 01:13:21.158]  My God!
[01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:26.599]  But the idea that QAnon is attacking me constantly, going, he's an Israeli shill, don't listen to him.
[01:13:27.019 --> 01:13:29.480]  Or maybe it's not even government agents at QAnon, they're Democrats.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.600]  Maybe they're just people that think there's a set market of conspiracy.
[01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:34.881]  Which there isn't.
[01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:36.201]  I'm trying to take the country and the world back.
[01:13:36.421 --> 01:13:39.482]  And so if we can knock Alex off, we'll be the ones people listen to.
[01:13:40.142 --> 01:13:42.642]  It's the death of logic and it's mental illness.
[01:13:43.602 --> 01:13:45.623]  Your reputation is amazing, Alex Jones.
[01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:47.003]  I will not let you down.
[01:13:49.019 --> 01:13:50.420]  President Trump, keep it up.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.781]  You're doing a great job, Alex.
[01:13:53.181 --> 01:13:56.383]  The Capitol Police, the Secret Service all love me.
[01:13:57.184 --> 01:13:58.745]  I was able to bullhorn without a permit.
[01:13:59.765 --> 01:14:01.006]  I mean, what do you think's going on here?
[01:14:01.226 --> 01:14:08.850]  But the idea, again, how I'm being attacked from the rear by so-called QAnon, that's how I started going after QAnons.
[01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:09.611]  They were attacking me.
[01:14:11.124 --> 01:14:12.185]  Again, who is QAnon?
[01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:17.788]  Oh, let's all just trust some anonymous thing that lays out breadcrumbs and says, as we all go, we all go, and all this stuff.
[01:14:17.808 --> 01:14:18.829]  And I'm like, okay, fine.
[01:14:19.049 --> 01:14:20.010]  Just leave me alone.
[01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:23.352]  Let me go out and be a real person in the field, in the arena.
[01:14:23.932 --> 01:14:25.113]  And it just doesn't stop.
[01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:34.499]  And so, again, the question to QAnon, whoever it is, whatever groups that magically have... I could pose as QAnon online, start a website, and say whatever I wanted.
[01:14:34.559 --> 01:14:35.200]  It's crazy.
[01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:37.706]  It's nuts!
[01:14:38.066 --> 01:14:39.287]  We have the real people on.
[01:14:39.327 --> 01:14:40.608]  We have the Colonel Schaffers on.
[01:14:40.649 --> 01:14:42.611]  We have the Ron Paul and Rand Pauls on.
[01:14:42.951 --> 01:14:45.333]  We have the Eric Bollings on.
[01:14:45.674 --> 01:14:47.596]  We have Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:47.696 --> 01:14:48.777]  We're fighting the globalists.
[01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:49.537]  We're for real.
[01:14:49.878 --> 01:14:50.979]  We're getting an effect.
[01:14:51.339 --> 01:14:52.320]  You know our name.
[01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:53.662]  You know who my daddy is.
[01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:54.462]  My mama is.
[01:14:54.683 --> 01:14:55.924]  You've seen them deplatform us.
[01:14:56.144 --> 01:14:57.345]  You've seen them come after us.
[01:14:58.266 --> 01:15:00.769]  And Q is just a secret critic.
[01:15:01.843 --> 01:15:06.245]  And people love riddles, they love jigsaw puzzles, they love this, and I've seen some really good stuff Q's put out.
[01:15:06.946 --> 01:15:09.127]  Whoever, it's a consortium, I've seen some bad stuff.
[01:15:09.487 --> 01:15:11.868]  It's like, people used to ask me, do you like anonymous?
[01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:14.810]  And I said, a lot of good stuff comes out of anonymous.
[01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:16.691]  Anonymous is anybody that's a whistleblower.
[01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:19.773]  So a lot of anonymous is good, a lot of anonymous is bad.
[01:15:20.573 --> 01:15:26.716]  And I think some of the lower IQ people out there just want something simple they can believe in to go along with, and it's very, very dangerous.
[01:15:26.936 --> 01:15:27.657]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:31.083]  So we're going to go to break, come back and finish up with this powerful Trump piece.
[01:15:31.123 --> 01:15:36.284]  But Hillary Clinton still is in control of a lot of the bureaucracy with the Bushes.
[01:15:37.584 --> 01:15:38.785]  And they're trying to hold on to their power.
[01:15:39.065 --> 01:15:46.066]  But as Trump consolidates power, they are getting less and less power to threaten their minions to carry out criminal operations against America.
[01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:48.027]  So they're just resigning instead.
[01:15:49.377 --> 01:15:51.858]  Because the Clintons are telling them, you either resign or you fight Trump.
[01:15:52.238 --> 01:15:53.299]  They're resigning now.
[01:15:53.399 --> 01:15:54.019]  We're winning.
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.020]  Praise God.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:56.060]  This is a great thing.
[01:15:56.581 --> 01:15:57.681]  Newswars.com.
[01:15:57.761 --> 01:15:58.182]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.202 --> 01:15:58.842]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:03.164 --> 01:16:06.286]  Why has America been so special compared to other nations?
[01:16:07.489 --> 01:16:10.171]  Why has it become the model of other successful countries?
[01:16:10.512 --> 01:16:11.973]  Why do so many people want to get here?
[01:16:12.733 --> 01:16:17.677]  Because of our constitutional republic and the basic freedoms that were protected for the individual.
[01:16:18.037 --> 01:16:24.463]  Even though we've had a lot of problems, the fact that we were the freest country in the world allowed incredible wealth to be developed.
[01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:26.886]  By the 1950s, the U.S.
[01:16:26.926 --> 01:16:32.474]  had over 80% of the world's patents and over half the wealth, and the biggest middle class the planet had ever seen.
[01:16:33.235 --> 01:16:37.201]  It was America that led the way on human rights, not just here, but around the world.
[01:16:38.069 --> 01:16:43.491]  But if you tune into the national news today, like CNN, you'd believe America was the worst place on Earth.
[01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:44.852]  And it's a horrible place.
[01:16:45.312 --> 01:16:45.792]  And why is that?
[01:16:45.812 --> 01:16:53.195]  It's because multinational corporations, working with the Communist Chinese, the EU and others, are demoralizing the nation to break us down.
[01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:57.517]  And to make us not care about our identity, so we can be absorbed into globalism.
[01:16:58.217 --> 01:17:06.621]  But thanks to InfoWars and thanks to the audience of activists out there, we have rebooted Americana and the resistance against the globalists.
[01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:12.083]  And now Trump coming in and turning the tide and exposing the whole fake Russiagate has them panicked.
[01:17:12.783 --> 01:17:17.565]  Nationalist populists are being elected in South America, in Europe, in the UK.
[01:17:17.906 --> 01:17:20.807]  It's happening everywhere and the power structure is panicking.
[01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:36.354]  That's why Big Tech, allied with the Chi-Coms, the authoritarian EU and others, are forcing the whole Hollywood hate America brainwashing on the public and bringing in censorship in an attempt to block us from completing the take back of the nation.
[01:17:36.794 --> 01:17:38.656]  And that's why, more than ever, you have to remember,
[01:17:39.076 --> 01:17:52.587]  Because of the censorship, you've got to come to newswars.com or infowars.com to hear what's really happening on the front lines and how you can help, not just save the country, but really the future destiny of the people of this planet.
[01:17:53.047 --> 01:18:02.275]  Because if the United States falls to tyranny and falls to leftist authoritarianism, the communist Chinese will be the dominant cultural force on the planet.
[01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:18.188]  That's why it's so critical that we understand that Democrats in Congress right now are attempting to bring in more draconian censorship of conservatives and others, while at the same time big tech heads lie to Congress and say they're not censoring when they've been caught red-handed.
[01:18:19.184 --> 01:18:24.549]  This is the legislative branch, and we need to take control of it to restore the republic.
[01:18:24.829 --> 01:18:31.114]  We also have to take control of the judicial, and that takes us to our next spot, the Supreme Court.
[01:18:31.234 --> 01:18:34.177]  Imagine what would have happened if Hillary Clinton would have been elected.
[01:18:34.657 --> 01:18:44.465]  It would have been a death blow to this country, because the Democrats now officially say they want to repeal the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so many other issues.
[01:18:44.525 --> 01:18:47.108]  This nation is still held by a threat.
[01:18:47.828 --> 01:18:53.572]  That's why it's so important to understand that the Democrats are the party of extremism, extreme anti-Americanism.
[01:18:53.932 --> 01:19:00.777]  The Republicans were a bunch of blue-blood establishment types, but we've had a populist insurrection that has partially taken it over.
[01:19:01.377 --> 01:19:12.985]  Now we've got to take it all the way over, keep Trump in the White House in 2020, and get more governorships and more state houses across this country to reverse the globalist plan to take down our nation.
[01:19:13.205 --> 01:19:14.886]  And that's why InfoWars is so important.
[01:19:15.226 --> 01:19:16.847]  InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:21.892]  Tomorrow's news today that will only get through to the people if you spread the word.
[01:19:22.993 --> 01:19:25.836]  Just while I've been out here walking today, I probably shook a hundred hands.
[01:19:26.557 --> 01:19:28.699]  And a third of them said, where are you?
[01:19:28.759 --> 01:19:29.640]  We miss you.
[01:19:30.241 --> 01:19:31.482]  We wish you were still on air.
[01:19:32.383 --> 01:19:37.007]  That's because they were habitualized on YouTube and on iTunes and everywhere else to listen to us.
[01:19:37.887 --> 01:19:40.668]  You have to come to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:46.211]  And I know the regular listeners understand that, but other people kind of just passively watch what pops up on their screen.
[01:19:46.571 --> 01:19:52.054]  They love the truth, they love liberty, but they're not thinking that there's an internet outside of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[01:19:52.414 --> 01:19:54.975]  That's why you are how we outreach.
[01:19:55.115 --> 01:19:59.437]  You are how we get this information through the sensors to others.
[01:19:59.978 --> 01:20:01.238]  You are the resistance.
[01:20:01.518 --> 01:20:02.379]  So God bless you all.
[01:20:06.371 --> 01:20:09.073]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.098 --> 01:20:31.512]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:39.399]  Cutting through the globalist propaganda, the Hollywood disinformation, like armor-piercing radar.
[01:20:40.159 --> 01:20:41.660]  We are the Infowar.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:48.044]  I am the vaunted dread of perverts, communists, and globalists, and Hollywood trash everywhere.
[01:20:48.804 --> 01:20:55.808]  I am the hated, the dreaded villain to the left, patriot, and brother-in-arms.
[01:20:56.969 --> 01:21:00.191]  To those that just love freedom and common sense, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:02.132]  This is a little bit of guitar right here.
[01:21:03.363 --> 01:21:04.524]  Alex and Eddie Van Halen.
[01:21:04.545 --> 01:21:08.489]  Good stuff right there.
[01:21:09.089 --> 01:21:13.193]  We're gonna go back to the president here in just a moment.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.083]  We're here to trigger people into action.
[01:21:23.924 --> 01:21:25.085]  Into being conscious and awake.
[01:21:25.996 --> 01:21:32.025]  I would imagine that some other people, maybe a little bit higher up, also knew about it, and maybe a lot higher up.
[01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.923]  You mentioned, I mentioned now Strzok and Page.
[01:21:43.283 --> 01:21:48.404]  Independently in their conversations, Peter Strzok had said about the collusion, there's no there there.
[01:21:48.924 --> 01:21:58.147]  Lisa Page closed-door testimony actually said after the nine-month FBI investigation, they had no evidence of anything with you and your campaign in Russia.
[01:21:58.487 --> 01:22:00.607]  That's before the appointment of Mueller.
[01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:03.248]  We also had the House Intel Committee report.
[01:22:03.608 --> 01:22:05.169]  That's two, no collusion.
[01:22:05.369 --> 01:22:06.329]  Then the Senate.
[01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:09.091]  Well, it was, as I call them, 13 angry Democrats.
[01:22:09.111 --> 01:22:10.492]  They were supplanted by five more.
[01:22:10.512 --> 01:22:11.914]  Five more were added.
[01:22:11.934 --> 01:22:12.855]  And you got up to 18, 19, 20.
[01:22:12.955 --> 01:22:13.435]  They were all
[01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:45.872]  Democrats, many of them made major contributions to the Hillary Clinton campaign, and they had one of them was one of the top people at the Clinton Foundation, Jeannie Ray.
[01:22:46.332 --> 01:22:47.332]  Then you had Weissman.
[01:22:47.392 --> 01:22:49.813]  You had some bad, bad, bad people.
[01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:52.213]  No friends of Trump.
[01:22:52.454 --> 01:22:53.234]  I had no friends.
[01:22:53.334 --> 01:22:56.635]  It was like a one-sided witch hunt, as I called it.
[01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:02.097]  You know, Bob Mueller, I turned him down to run the FBI.
[01:23:02.117 --> 01:23:07.521]  The next day, he was appointed to be the head of this special council, as they call it.
[01:23:07.581 --> 01:23:10.343]  It's really a much tougher word than that, but I won't use it.
[01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:13.425]  And it was a terrible thing.
[01:23:13.485 --> 01:23:15.686]  He was conflicted for that reason.
[01:23:16.227 --> 01:23:21.631]  He also was conflicted because of the fact that Comey and him are best friends.
[01:23:22.251 --> 01:23:25.733]  So, if not best, very close to best, but I would say best friends.
[01:23:25.753 --> 01:23:27.795]  You look at pictures of the two of them in the past,
[01:23:28.813 --> 01:23:33.455]  We had a nasty business transaction, the two of us.
[01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.356]  I had a nasty transaction with him.
[01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:38.377]  And then all of a sudden he's my prosecutor.
[01:23:39.278 --> 01:23:40.838]  Very, very unfair.
[01:23:41.699 --> 01:23:49.142]  And with all of that and $35 million spent, think of that, over two years ruining lives of people, ruining their lives.
[01:23:50.423 --> 01:23:53.084]  People going out of business because they couldn't afford lawyers.
[01:23:54.111 --> 01:23:56.632]  It's just unbelievable what happened, how bad it was.
[01:23:56.712 --> 01:23:58.193]  I can't even tell you how bad it was.
[01:23:58.293 --> 01:24:00.935]  Nobody knows how people suffered.
[01:24:01.195 --> 01:24:04.917]  Great people that came to Washington, they came to D.C.
[01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:09.319]  to set the world in a very positive way on fire.
[01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:15.662]  They wanted to clean things up and do a great job, but all of a sudden they're testifying on nonsense.
[01:24:16.442 --> 01:24:17.743]  And it's really a shame.
[01:24:17.843 --> 01:24:23.206]  And you know, with all of the things you've heard, nothing had to do with the campaign, nothing had to do with Russia collusion.
[01:24:24.105 --> 01:24:48.213]  But the bottom line is with a group of very serious Trump haters, a group of, I call them angry Democrats, somebody who is very conflicted at the top, no collusion and also no obstruction because the statement was made and the Attorney General, you know, understood it very well and he read it and he made a decision right on the spot.
[01:24:48.513 --> 01:24:49.353]  No obstruction.
[01:24:50.322 --> 01:25:01.485]  So you had no collusion, no obstruction, $35 million spent and unlimited manpower, woman power, and there's nothing, nothing.
[01:25:02.165 --> 01:25:06.706]  And it was a very bad two years for this country.
[01:25:07.366 --> 01:25:12.047]  But what has happened is we found everything going in the opposite direction.
[01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:14.948]  And I think now it's turning unbelievable.
[01:25:14.968 --> 01:25:17.889]  The tables have turned and you're seeing things come out like you just
[01:25:19.288 --> 01:25:24.093]  Like you just noticed, and I think it's going to be very interesting.
[01:25:24.113 --> 01:25:28.697]  It's very important for the country to now find out how that whole thing started.
[01:25:28.758 --> 01:25:34.083]  And in all fairness to Bob Mueller, it started long before he was appointed.
[01:25:34.243 --> 01:25:35.944]  This was going on long before that.
[01:25:35.985 --> 01:25:40.809]  You understand, the First Lady and I came down on the escalator on June 16th.
[01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.198]  And this started very shortly after that.
[01:25:44.659 --> 01:25:45.639]  It was a disgrace.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:46.740]  Disgrace.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:51.603]  Mr. President, we expect a lot more coming out in the days, weeks, and even months ahead.
[01:25:51.703 --> 01:25:59.127]  We know at least 53 more closed door, the testimony closed door of many of these players.
[01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.288]  That will be released.
[01:26:00.368 --> 01:26:09.694]  We know that the Inspector General, he now will have his report, we expect sometime in perhaps in May, likely in May, where he will
[01:26:10.274 --> 01:26:13.439]  He's been investigating the FISA abuse issue.
[01:26:14.521 --> 01:26:19.929]  And then, of course, we have Huber on leaking and whatever his report ultimately ends up becoming.
[01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:23.914]  We know that, you know, there's a lot of information.
[01:26:23.954 --> 01:26:24.615]  And then the issue
[01:26:26.057 --> 01:26:36.123]  You have, the last time I talked to you about a month ago, you said you would declassify the FISA applications, you would declassify Gang of Eight material, 302 material.
[01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:52.432]  If the Grassley-Graham-Nunes memos are correct in the bulk of information in the FISA applications, or even as the New York Times suggested this week, may have been misinformation from the Russians that Hillary bought and paid for, that was
[01:26:53.112 --> 01:26:56.675]  Disseminated to the media and the American people before that election?
[01:26:57.596 --> 01:26:59.758]  You know, what would that mean to you?
[01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:12.108]  Well, first of all, I was very impressed that the New York Times did that because that was the first good glimpse that maybe mainstream is going to pick up the greatest political scandal in the history of our country.
[01:27:12.408 --> 01:27:14.550]  Again, bigger than Watergate.
[01:27:15.499 --> 01:27:16.639]  Because it means so much.
[01:27:16.659 --> 01:27:17.520]  This was a coup.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.881]  This wasn't stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments.
[01:27:22.941 --> 01:27:24.442]  This was an attempted coup.
[01:27:25.342 --> 01:27:26.403]  And it's inconceivable.
[01:27:26.423 --> 01:27:27.763]  Like a third world country.
[01:27:28.683 --> 01:27:29.844]  And inconceivable.
[01:27:30.284 --> 01:27:34.625]  And I have to say that I think a lot of information is coming out and it's coming out fast.
[01:27:35.025 --> 01:27:36.846]  Much faster than anybody would have thought.
[01:27:37.846 --> 01:27:40.027]  And there are a lot of people very nervous about
[01:27:40.678 --> 01:27:45.685]  Things that are going on and I will say that IG, the Inspector General Horowitz,
[01:27:46.443 --> 01:27:52.124]  So Trump knows what's going on, but he's letting them stew in their juices and is making his move against him.
[01:27:52.164 --> 01:27:54.385]  I've talked to three people, two of which met with him personally.
[01:27:55.365 --> 01:27:58.426]  One who was persecuted, one who's a major journalist, the other I'm not going to mention.
[01:27:59.486 --> 01:28:03.207]  And they said this early last week that Trump is going to go after them.
[01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:05.428]  The Justice Department is going to indict them.
[01:28:05.808 --> 01:28:06.688]  They have all the proof.
[01:28:06.768 --> 01:28:15.150]  And so that's the big news, is that Trump is going to push and greenlight a political war with the deep state to indict Hillary.
[01:28:16.050 --> 01:28:21.292]  Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Brennan, Clapper, all of them.
[01:28:21.952 --> 01:28:27.054]  All of them have committed incredibly brazen crimes, thought they were invincible, thought they were above the law.
[01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:34.917]  And Mueller, who was trying to pin this on Trump, rolled over, realizing how sloppily it had been done and which way the wind was blowing.
[01:28:35.698 --> 01:28:39.899]  And so their whole attempted criminal operation is going down in giant flames.
[01:28:39.959 --> 01:28:43.441]  And we just laid all that out in the last hour.
[01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:54.389]  When we come back, we're going to get into the latest information that's unfolding on geopolitical issues, the economy, the collapsing border, and so much more in just a few minutes.
[01:28:54.509 --> 01:28:55.270]  Please stay with us.

[01:30:05.618 --> 01:30:11.683]  The globalists and tyrants everywhere seek control, dumb down masses so they can play God.
[01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:28.336]  And the American system of true rugged individualism, the Wild Wild West, everything we've been through, our entire history, beating the British Empire when no one else had ever done it up until that time, and it was ragtag forces that did it, is the stuff of legend.
[01:30:29.036 --> 01:30:36.843]  And that's why the globalists want to break up our families and demoralize us and give us false histories about our country so that they can break us down and control us.
[01:30:37.123 --> 01:30:45.670]  It's classic military tactics that when you occupy a nation and the people aren't giving up, you demoralize them, you teach them that they're bad people, you turn them against each other.
[01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.752]  But humanity is smarter than that.
[01:30:48.012 --> 01:30:56.901]  Despite all the cultural attacks, all the biological attacks, all the GMO, all the vaccines, all of it, still, humanity is beginning to awaken.
[01:30:56.941 --> 01:31:04.910]  Not just here, but from Brazil, to Japan, to the coast of Spain, and Catalonia, to the great folks in Greece, right through Europe and France.
[01:31:06.051 --> 01:31:11.637]  And so the authoritarians are cracking down to make us submit and break our will.
[01:31:11.797 --> 01:31:15.061]  And the tighter they squeeze, the more people are gonna wake up and resist.
[01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:17.063]  But it's an incredibly dangerous time as well.
[01:31:17.143 --> 01:31:22.008]  And that's why listeners and viewers have to understand that this is very, very close.
[01:31:22.288 --> 01:31:27.334]  They are attacking and savagely destroying and trying to defeat anybody they can.
[01:31:27.594 --> 01:31:31.199]  Ahead of major moves they're going to pull in the next year.
[01:31:31.379 --> 01:31:33.321]  This is the most critical time in human development.
[01:31:33.341 --> 01:31:34.703]  Everybody sees it, they feel it.
[01:31:34.783 --> 01:31:38.428]  I love fighting the Globeless, but I don't like having to sit up here and ask for your support.
[01:31:38.548 --> 01:31:42.533]  So when I do it, I make sure it's something you really need, so I feel good about pushing it.
[01:31:42.593 --> 01:31:46.498]  Gosh, if I was selling tickets to Vegas to go gambling, I'd think I'd jump off a cliff.
[01:31:46.798 --> 01:31:48.679]  I'm promoting water filtration for you and your children.
[01:31:48.699 --> 01:31:49.240]  That's a must.
[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:50.601]  All the stuff in the water table.
[01:31:50.661 --> 01:31:51.601]  I'm promoting air filtration.
[01:31:51.641 --> 01:31:53.983]  Promoting non-GMO heirloom seeds that are great to plant.
[01:31:54.043 --> 01:31:56.144]  Whether you live in the city or out in the countryside.
[01:31:56.284 --> 01:31:57.345]  I promote great supplements.
[01:31:57.485 --> 01:31:58.306]  I promote t-shirts.
[01:31:58.426 --> 01:32:00.047]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:32:00.407 --> 01:32:03.809]  I just automatically can't do things that are bad to people.
[01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:05.811]  When I am bad, I feel really sorry for you.
[01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:07.592]  And so you're getting a straight shoot here.
[01:32:07.792 --> 01:32:09.053]  And we've got only a few days left.
[01:32:09.073 --> 01:32:10.474]  Fifty to sixty percent off.
[01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:14.295]  Storewide free shipping and double Patriot points of so much more.
[01:32:14.335 --> 01:32:17.135]  And at these prices, you don't really make that much money off of it.
[01:32:17.195 --> 01:32:20.156]  People like the product so much it ends up later than reordering so it's worth it.
[01:32:20.176 --> 01:32:23.797]  But just please take action and know you couldn't put your dollars down.
[01:32:24.017 --> 01:32:27.738]  You couldn't put your money down somewhere to get better products that go to a better cause.
[01:32:27.858 --> 01:32:29.778]  It's a win-win and you're crazy.
[01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:34.479]  If you don't, get the X2 or get the Brain Force or get the Wake of America coffee and then sign up for AutoShip.
[01:32:34.599 --> 01:32:35.319]  We need your help.
[01:32:35.339 --> 01:32:37.760]  I want to thank you all that have and encourage those that haven't.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.225]  What are you thinking, man?
[01:32:39.467 --> 01:32:40.754]  We need your help right now.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:10.461]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.203 --> 01:33:21.564]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[01:33:22.344 --> 01:33:24.624]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[01:33:25.785 --> 01:33:26.885]  This is not a new world.
[01:33:28.045 --> 01:33:31.326]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[01:33:32.435 --> 01:33:39.939]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[01:33:40.859 --> 01:33:47.822]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[01:33:48.903 --> 01:33:53.525]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[01:33:54.646 --> 01:33:56.867]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:34:02.352 --> 01:34:04.052]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[01:34:04.953 --> 01:34:10.614]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[01:34:11.614 --> 01:34:15.195]  Because he is built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[01:34:16.396 --> 01:34:20.957]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[01:34:35.687 --> 01:34:37.447]  Oh, it's science fiction.
[01:34:38.928 --> 01:34:43.310]  It's not what we thought it'd be, but it's here.
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:47.571]  Oh, wait, it is what I thought it would be, because I was reading the Globeless Battle Plan.
[01:34:48.472 --> 01:34:52.753]  They want to seize the future by controlling civilization and its development.
[01:34:53.294 --> 01:34:59.716]  I want you to control your own destiny and have free will, because I follow God's plan.
[01:35:00.376 --> 01:35:01.457]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:08.288]  Okay, we have got a giant plethora of news and information to cover.
[01:35:08.368 --> 01:35:24.158]  I did just spend the last hour and a half covering the events I witnessed in D.C., the sources I talked to, and of course you see it all crowned with a cherry on top by the President basically saying everything I said on Sean Hannity last night.
[01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:29.442]  This is a really good sign, and it shows us that the President is really going in the right direction.
[01:35:29.902 --> 01:35:32.524]  Does that mean he's going to do everything the way we all want him to do?
[01:35:33.413 --> 01:35:35.935]  No, I'm sure as listeners you disagree with a lot of what I have to say.
[01:35:35.955 --> 01:35:37.957]  I probably disagree with some of what you think.
[01:35:39.618 --> 01:35:41.420]  But overall, he's trying to be president.
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:42.901]  He's trying to have prosperity.
[01:35:43.302 --> 01:35:44.503]  He's trying to be pragmatic.
[01:35:44.863 --> 01:35:46.124]  He's trying to not sell the country out.
[01:35:46.605 --> 01:35:47.926]  That said, start of the next segment.
[01:35:49.417 --> 01:35:54.258]  He has done something the last 24 hours that is a big, bad problem.
[01:35:54.879 --> 01:35:57.059]  It's not something we can halfway disagree with him on.
[01:35:57.079 --> 01:36:00.180]  This is something very, very serious.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:05.342]  So we're going to have to take the president proverbially to the woodshed, start the next segment.
[01:36:05.762 --> 01:36:11.743]  And then later in the next hour, I interviewed Eric Bolling.
[01:36:12.624 --> 01:36:13.964]  Very powerful interview.
[01:36:17.034 --> 01:36:24.080]  Then he interviewed me for 25 minutes for his syndicated TV show and for Sinclair, both BlazeTV and Sinclair, where they both aired.
[01:36:27.122 --> 01:36:32.026]  We're going to air part of my interview with him and then the whole Sinclair or
[01:36:33.123 --> 01:36:38.008]  Blaise TV interview in the last 45 minutes of the next hour because it needs to go out to the full stations.
[01:36:38.468 --> 01:36:39.289]  It's great audio.
[01:36:39.349 --> 01:36:40.430]  It's great visuals as well.
[01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:42.071]  It's perfect for radio and TV.
[01:36:42.472 --> 01:36:47.116]  Some of these interviews aren't good because we're simulcast, so it's not good for radio or it's not good for TV.
[01:36:47.156 --> 01:36:56.685]  This is a really powerful interview, but the topic he got into because we were privately talking about provocateurs trying to start fights with us.
[01:36:57.910 --> 01:37:00.011]  And trying to come up and confront us at restaurants.
[01:37:00.031 --> 01:37:03.392]  They've done it to Tucker Carlson, they do it to Trump's family, they do it to Eric.
[01:37:03.892 --> 01:37:11.515]  He warned me while I was in the Trump Hotel, where he stays a few days a week when he's in DC, that provocateurs will try to come up and start fights with you.
[01:37:13.215 --> 01:37:23.399]  Mainly I got nothing but love in there, but they said routinely people do pull the fire alarm to harass the patrons and it happened at midnight on
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:28.122]  Wednesday night, even though I was getting up at 3.30 to catch a 6 a.m.
[01:37:28.162 --> 01:37:28.462]  flight.
[01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:38.148]  That was enjoyable, but I'd stay there all over again just to thumb at the nose the establishment because Max Keiser was in there and all these other cool people.
[01:37:38.868 --> 01:37:48.794]  You want to see the bar scene of conservatives and liberals and Media Matters and BuzzFeed sneaking around in there.
[01:37:49.515 --> 01:37:53.357]  Go have cocktails or go in there at happy hour or in the evening.
[01:37:54.645 --> 01:37:55.826]  At Trump Hotel in D.C.
[01:37:55.906 --> 01:37:57.488]  and it is wild.
[01:37:57.508 --> 01:38:00.511]  And it's a super nice hotel on top of it.
[01:38:00.531 --> 01:38:02.573]  I love the whole motif.
[01:38:03.554 --> 01:38:09.060]  I love that black on white marble and the blue on it and just the whole setup is exactly my style.
[01:38:11.889 --> 01:38:15.591]  My wife was wanting to remodel the house, and I said, yeah, let's do it like this.
[01:38:15.611 --> 01:38:16.452]  She goes, oh, I like that.
[01:38:16.492 --> 01:38:21.135]  I said, yeah, let's go with the Trump hotel look, at least for the living room and dining room.
[01:38:21.855 --> 01:38:24.477]  But I'm digressing, my friends.
[01:38:26.938 --> 01:38:40.807]  It's just that when he was telling me about what they did to his son, and then he actually started crying because the crew, his crew hadn't gotten there to the Capitol yet.
[01:38:42.617 --> 01:38:47.918]  On Wednesday in the morning, we started talking about what they did to him after his son died.
[01:38:47.938 --> 01:38:51.459]  He literally couldn't help it, like tears went out of his eyes.
[01:38:51.499 --> 01:38:52.159]  I couldn't blame him.
[01:38:53.519 --> 01:38:55.380]  And they told the story of what they did to him.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:56.440]  And I said, have you really told this?
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.440]  He goes, well, not all of it.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:59.821]  And I hadn't really put the video out, even though it got caught on video.
[01:39:00.381 --> 01:39:04.802]  But what they did to him shows you how incredibly nasty these people are.
[01:39:05.663 --> 01:39:07.304]  You know about the opium epidemic.
[01:39:07.404 --> 01:39:08.664]  You know about the opioid epidemic.
[01:39:09.324 --> 01:39:14.026]  You know that it's 10 times the number of people are dying every year that were dying 20 years ago.
[01:39:14.126 --> 01:39:20.428]  I mean, everybody I know has friends or family that have people that have almost died or died from pills.
[01:39:21.168 --> 01:39:22.869]  And they're so much stronger than they've ever been.
[01:39:23.049 --> 01:39:24.169]  And they're all over the place.
[01:39:24.769 --> 01:39:27.870]  They've been subscribing 10 times the number they used to.
[01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.891]  So 10 times the death.
[01:39:29.411 --> 01:39:30.851]  Boy, math works that way.
[01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:32.492]  And his son died.
[01:39:33.632 --> 01:39:35.753]  of an opium overdose, a pill overdose.
[01:39:36.074 --> 01:39:36.874]  They were best friends.
[01:39:36.954 --> 01:39:37.755]  I know folks that knew him.
[01:39:38.635 --> 01:39:40.516]  And it just tears his guts out.
[01:39:43.838 --> 01:39:47.521]  And then they say, your son killed himself because he was ashamed of you being fired.
[01:39:48.361 --> 01:39:49.642]  Because that all happened at the same time.
[01:39:49.682 --> 01:39:51.003]  He was fired for made up stuff.
[01:39:51.743 --> 01:39:55.886]  But it's how they came in and set him up and laughed at him to try to get him to hit him.
[01:39:57.318 --> 01:39:59.080]  So they could then get him fired off his new job.
[01:39:59.601 --> 01:40:09.654]  And that's why I've got to remember, because they may confront me 20 times in the street, or knock my drink over, or slap me in the back of the head, or confront me, and 19 times out of 20, I take it.
[01:40:11.391 --> 01:40:16.056]  But like that Lucy's Fried Chicken man, three times they came to my table and said, F you, you're going to get it.
[01:40:16.296 --> 01:40:17.838]  You're going to be basically dead soon.
[01:40:18.199 --> 01:40:19.600]  It was like, you're going to be gone soon.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:20.281]  You're going to get it.
[01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:21.342]  Yeah, F you.
[01:40:21.402 --> 01:40:22.103]  Yeah, F you.
[01:40:22.443 --> 01:40:24.185]  And just looking at me like, huh, get you.
[01:40:24.726 --> 01:40:28.870]  And you know, you want to break their jaw, but you can't do it.
[01:40:29.841 --> 01:40:34.025]  We just have to be Christ-like at this point, and not because we're wimps, but because it's what they want.
[01:40:34.285 --> 01:40:41.431]  We're beating them politically, we're beating them culturally, we're beating them with the awakening happening, and it's why the establishment is panicking.
[01:40:42.111 --> 01:40:46.575]  So as much fun as it'd be to just break their nose, then they win.
[01:40:47.556 --> 01:40:48.196]  Then they win.
[01:40:48.717 --> 01:40:52.961]  And so even though I've had them dump hot coffee in my face, dump tea on the back of my head, spit,
[01:40:53.789 --> 01:40:59.631]  Coca-Cola in my face, Jimmy Dore, even though I've had him step on my hand.
[01:40:59.651 --> 01:41:02.792]  I was in a hot tub in Hawaii and the guy stepped on my hand.
[01:41:03.613 --> 01:41:05.394]  And I said, I thought, that's true, that's an accident.
[01:41:05.414 --> 01:41:07.874]  And he gets in the hot tub and starts going, you're really tough, aren't you, Alex?
[01:41:07.894 --> 01:41:09.035]  Why don't you get out of here?
[01:41:10.182 --> 01:41:11.783]  Then his own friend said, hey, you're gonna get thrown out.
[01:41:11.823 --> 01:41:12.444]  Let's get out of here.
[01:41:12.864 --> 01:41:20.770]  These people have no... I mean, how would that guy feel if I just jumped on him and slammed his head under the jaw back into the edge of the hot tub and he'd break his neck?
[01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:23.412]  I mean, dude, you don't know who you're messing with.
[01:41:23.452 --> 01:41:26.274]  I'm not bragging here, but I will explosively attack you people.
[01:41:26.994 --> 01:41:28.176]  You're really playing with fire.
[01:41:28.756 --> 01:41:31.880]  But I understand Eric Bolling's a former professional baseball player, successful.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:32.901]  He's a tough guy too.
[01:41:33.382 --> 01:41:43.233]  And you know, people mess with you, man, and they mess with you, and they mess, you know, like this guy that I got on video of here, a TV viewer, spitting in my face, grabbing my testicles, hitting me in the face with his fan, which actually hit my eye.
[01:41:43.253 --> 01:41:44.635]  It actually scratched my eye.
[01:41:44.655 --> 01:41:45.817]  People said, oh, Bill, you don't be a wimp.
[01:41:46.337 --> 01:41:51.461]  You have to sit there and just take it like Obi-Wan Kenobi, because there's a larger situation.
[01:41:51.481 --> 01:41:54.104]  By the way, he kept telling me how much he likes children.
[01:41:54.124 --> 01:41:54.924]  Do you like children?
[01:41:55.425 --> 01:41:56.606]  Well, he grabbed my testicles.
[01:41:57.226 --> 01:42:00.329]  So, these are sick people, is all I'm telling you.
[01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:04.012]  And they want violence because they're losing the political fight.
[01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:14.059]  And that's why we can't let them pull off new Charlottevilles or any other stuff where they hire a bunch of fake white supremacists, which we know they did, and then have them clash with a bunch of professors in black uniforms.
[01:42:14.439 --> 01:42:15.360]  See, I didn't get to the news.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:16.740]  I digressed off into that.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:21.321]  Eric Bolling, next hour, first part of the interview that we shot.
[01:42:21.341 --> 01:42:23.022]  Here's what's going to happen.
[01:42:23.042 --> 01:42:24.822]  We're going to air half of our interview with him.
[01:42:25.662 --> 01:42:27.383]  Then we're going to air his interview with me.
[01:42:27.923 --> 01:42:32.504]  And then on the Sunday show, I'll air the other 10 minutes of my interview with Eric Bolling.
[01:42:33.786 --> 01:42:35.167]  Because it would fill a whole hour.
[01:42:35.687 --> 01:42:37.288]  But this is going to fill 45 minutes.
[01:42:37.308 --> 01:42:38.029]  But it's powerful.
[01:42:38.349 --> 01:42:38.909]  It's important.
[01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:42.191]  It needs to be seen to understand just how nasty these bastards are.
[01:42:43.852 --> 01:42:44.633]  Bastards are good people.
[01:42:44.673 --> 01:42:45.413]  I shouldn't call them bastards.
[01:42:45.433 --> 01:42:46.694]  Just how horrible these rats are.
[01:42:47.114 --> 01:42:48.355]  We have to control ourselves.
[01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:50.376]  Now, when we come back, the latest on the border.
[01:42:50.776 --> 01:42:53.238]  Trump is now striking back in unorthodox ways.
[01:42:53.618 --> 01:42:56.220]  Stay with us for this and so much more.

[01:43:12.967 --> 01:43:13.507]  It's still there.

[01:44:07.032 --> 01:44:10.935]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[01:44:11.375 --> 01:44:13.176]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:44:13.296 --> 01:44:13.997]  Good to talk to you.
[01:44:14.337 --> 01:44:18.499]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:20.461]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[01:44:20.581 --> 01:44:24.923]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:44:25.164 --> 01:44:31.488]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[01:44:31.568 --> 01:44:33.049]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:44:33.089 --> 01:44:33.589]  Tell us about it.
[01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:34.349]  Well, it's really great.
[01:44:34.369 --> 01:44:35.569]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:44:35.609 --> 01:44:36.049]  I take it.
[01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.730]  It tastes good.
[01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:38.490]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:40.250]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:43.691]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:44:43.711 --> 01:44:46.391]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:47.972]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:44:48.092 --> 01:44:49.952]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:44:50.072 --> 01:44:50.552]  So, yeah.
[01:44:50.932 --> 01:44:52.792]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:55.573]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.

[01:46:57.684 --> 01:47:00.547]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.504 --> 01:47:44.882]  Well, you've got your diamond And you've got your pretty clothes And the chauffeur drives your car You let everybody know But don't play with me Cause you're playing with fire
[01:47:51.128 --> 01:47:55.352]  We're good to go.
[01:48:20.325 --> 01:48:28.471]  Well, just like Jussie Smollett's allowed to stage terror attacks on himself to cause a race war, and now they're bringing him back to empire.
[01:48:29.831 --> 01:48:40.299]  The Baltimore mayor, who reportedly got busted, she's been raided, taking big kickbacks, just like Bernie Sanders' wife does for scams at colleges and schools with books.
[01:48:41.559 --> 01:48:48.084]  She's been raided over that, but suddenly she can't talk to police or make a plea because she's collapsed physically.
[01:48:49.295 --> 01:48:51.117]  They'll probably give her a show on Empire.
[01:48:52.958 --> 01:48:53.839]  But that's what's happening.
[01:48:53.919 --> 01:49:01.245]  Massachusetts judge faces federal charges for blocking immigration arrest.
[01:49:01.946 --> 01:49:03.687]  Reuters, U.S.
[01:49:03.707 --> 01:49:16.478]  federal prosecutors, on Thursday charged Massachusetts judge and court officer with conspiracy and obstruction, saying they blocked an immigration and customs enforcement officer from asserting
[01:49:17.409 --> 01:49:20.875]  An arresting an illegal immigrant in a 2018 court proceeding.
[01:49:22.844 --> 01:49:30.131]  The move marks the latest skirmish over immigration between President Donald Trump's administration and local governments who have resisted the crackdown.
[01:49:30.351 --> 01:49:36.096]  Now they've got the mayors of major cities telling MS-13 when a raid's coming for meth.
[01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:40.019]  The state's Democratic Attorney General called the charges politically motivated.
[01:49:40.059 --> 01:49:40.780]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:41.261 --> 01:49:43.903]  You guys are invading the federal space.
[01:49:44.604 --> 01:49:48.807]  It was always the feds invading the local space, but now it's the locals invading the federal space.
[01:49:49.688 --> 01:49:51.609]  And trying to make sure our border collapses.
[01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:58.594]  We have 1,200 people, they admit, being released today because the prisons, the detainment facilities are full.
[01:49:59.035 --> 01:50:01.376]  The judges are all overwhelmed and can't handle what's going on.
[01:50:03.258 --> 01:50:03.998]  And people blame Trump.
[01:50:04.038 --> 01:50:10.122]  He tried to get additional billions of dollars to fund it, and the Democrats tried to put it in there that you can only have 1,700 beds.
[01:50:11.243 --> 01:50:13.525]  They need a million beds right now, literally.
[01:50:14.926 --> 01:50:15.446]  They've only got 100,000 beds.
[01:50:17.947 --> 01:50:19.348]  The move marks the latest skirmish.
[01:50:19.388 --> 01:50:28.134]  The charges target Massachusetts District Court Judge Shelley Joseph 51, a Massachusetts trial court officer, Wesley McGregor.
[01:50:29.535 --> 01:50:41.063]  It focuses on an April 2018 hearing in Newtown District Court outside Boston, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer intended to arrest an identified suspected illegal immigrant from the Dominican Republic facing a drug charge.
[01:50:41.083 --> 01:50:47.348]  It described a huddled conversation between the judge and the defendant's lawyer in which Joseph asked ICE
[01:50:48.752 --> 01:50:49.435]  He's going to get him.
[01:50:50.159 --> 01:50:52.591]  And later says, I'm not going to allow them to come in here.
[01:50:55.151 --> 01:50:56.872]  No, the Democrats are committing mass political crime.
[01:50:57.472 --> 01:50:58.733]  They've got to be met.
[01:50:58.753 --> 01:50:59.474]  They've got to be dealt with.
[01:51:23.823 --> 01:51:26.365]  Is the beginning of the type of activity we need to see.
[01:51:26.845 --> 01:51:27.526]  There's footage.
[01:51:27.546 --> 01:51:28.967]  I don't know if I gave this to you guys.
[01:51:29.227 --> 01:51:30.188]  Did you guys pull up the footage?
[01:51:31.469 --> 01:51:32.029]  New video.
[01:51:33.110 --> 01:51:34.351]  The American Mayor reports on it.
[01:51:34.711 --> 01:51:37.773]  Stream of illegals ushered to awaiting buses.
[01:51:38.954 --> 01:51:40.155]  Democrat Party buses.
[01:51:40.215 --> 01:51:40.996]  Taxpayer paid for them.
[01:51:41.016 --> 01:51:42.057]  They just disappeared.
[01:51:42.137 --> 01:51:42.677]  No names.
[01:51:42.737 --> 01:51:43.278]  No IDs.
[01:51:44.078 --> 01:51:45.499]  No diseases are tested for.
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:47.461]  No nothing.
[01:51:49.124 --> 01:51:49.524]  Here it is.
[01:51:49.644 --> 01:51:53.706]  Trump's DHS releases 7,000 illegal aliens into the U.S.
[01:51:54.446 --> 01:51:55.567]  in only five days.
[01:51:55.967 --> 01:51:57.608]  The Democrats say, send them to red cities.
[01:51:57.968 --> 01:51:58.668]  Don't send them to us.
[01:51:58.688 --> 01:51:59.429]  You're going to pay for it.
[01:51:59.449 --> 01:52:06.092]  2019 migrant, you mean illegal alien, numbers have surpassed all of 2018.
[01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:12.615]  Trump has now warned Mexico after armed troops disarmed U.S.
[01:52:12.655 --> 01:52:15.316]  soldiers on American side of the border.
[01:52:15.616 --> 01:52:16.477]  That's how pathetic
[01:52:17.523 --> 01:52:22.725]  The establishment in Mexico thinks we are, and much of their army openly works for the cartels.
[01:52:23.045 --> 01:52:26.906]  As Trump rightly said, this was a diversion for them to bring drugs across.
[01:52:28.087 --> 01:52:38.551]  And now we have constant footage of armed men wearing ski masks leading the invaders who've paid them money to be smuggled into the U.S.
[01:52:38.731 --> 01:52:39.071]  across.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:48.364]  This is how it all works, ladies and gentlemen, as anarchy of the third world sweeps into our country.
[01:52:48.884 --> 01:52:54.967]  And as almost all the middle class and rich Mexicans and others have fled to the U.S., Mexico continues to collapse.
[01:52:55.067 --> 01:52:57.189]  And now it's collapsing into Southern California.
[01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:00.511]  Unbelievable.
[01:53:01.587 --> 01:53:05.068]  Meanwhile, mother of all caravans due in Mexico City any day.
[01:53:05.088 --> 01:53:09.069]  10,000 migrants from Africa, Central America, Cuba, heading to U.S.
[01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.409]  borders.
[01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:11.630]  See, the international collapse is starting.
[01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:13.610]  These folks pay the U.N.
[01:53:13.630 --> 01:53:17.971]  and others to ship them here, then they march up into the United States.
[01:53:18.331 --> 01:53:27.594]  The biggest crisis for our border this country's ever seen, orchestrated by the U.N., the Obama State Department, and others, and they're allowing it all to unfold.
[01:53:28.797 --> 01:53:35.560]  Speaking of that, let's go to a clip here of a business owner in California.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:43.844]  This clip's gone viral, talking about what it's like to have human sewage running down the street.
[01:53:45.492 --> 01:53:49.555]  This is very, very important information for everyone.
[01:53:49.875 --> 01:53:54.939]  Los Angeles business owner, raw sewage in streets, creating health crisis.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.182]  Oh, even the local officials in L.A.
[01:53:58.522 --> 01:54:06.048]  and in New York City have to admit it's illegal aliens spreading the measles and pertussis, whooping cough, but it doesn't matter.
[01:54:06.188 --> 01:54:07.750]  People that have had the vaccines are getting it.
[01:54:08.584 --> 01:54:09.985]  So they're saying, oh, get another shot!
[01:54:10.285 --> 01:54:11.425]  Well, wait, I got one a year ago!
[01:54:11.685 --> 01:54:13.026]  The vaccines are scams.
[01:54:13.286 --> 01:54:14.207]  They don't protect you.
[01:54:14.467 --> 01:54:16.068]  They're Trojan horses for other things.
[01:54:16.548 --> 01:54:21.090]  But the point is, you bring in illegals from collapsed, horrible countries, they're going to spread the real thing.
[01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:24.952]  The truth is, running water and hygiene had eradicated these things.
[01:54:25.232 --> 01:54:27.193]  Now we bring in the third world, it's back!
[01:54:27.673 --> 01:54:31.775]  But then even Trump comes out and says, we need to all take measles shots.
[01:54:31.795 --> 01:54:35.216]  No, we need to stop the illegal aliens that are not even being screened.
[01:54:35.537 --> 01:54:36.097]  Here's that report.
[01:54:37.335 --> 01:54:40.257]  Karen Hicks has been in Los Angeles for a long time.
[01:54:40.277 --> 01:54:45.600]  Her family has run a business there for more than a hundred years, and they say the city is becoming unlivable.
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.741]  Karen Hicks joins us.
[01:54:46.981 --> 01:54:49.483]  Karen, thanks very much for coming on tonight.
[01:54:49.883 --> 01:54:56.368]  We're going to put, as we speak, pictures on the screen, I think, that you took from around your business of what it actually looks like.
[01:54:56.788 --> 01:55:00.290]  So, your family has a business basically in downtown Los Angeles?
[01:55:01.631 --> 01:55:01.851]  Yes.
[01:55:02.371 --> 01:55:04.813]  It's been in the same location for over 102 years.
[01:55:07.575 --> 01:55:13.182]  And yes, these are pictures of what is going on right around our neighborhood.
[01:55:13.963 --> 01:55:20.671]  So we're seeing, I mean, some of these pictures are almost too disgusting to put on the screen, but we have a number of them of RVs.
[01:55:22.153 --> 01:55:22.333]  Yes.
[01:55:22.714 --> 01:55:24.195]  People are living in those full-time?
[01:55:25.905 --> 01:55:28.669]  Yes, people are living in them full time.
[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:33.515]  You will notice there is raw sewage that is coming out.
[01:55:34.176 --> 01:55:39.964]  This raw sewage, it ends up in one place, in our gutters, which goes down to our oceans.
[01:55:41.145 --> 01:55:45.429]  Um, it is, it's more than an environmental crisis.
[01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:48.051]  It is a health crisis down in this area.
[01:55:48.071 --> 01:55:52.495]  I have reached out to our councilperson, Councilman Price.
[01:55:52.615 --> 01:55:59.681]  I reached out to Mayor Garcetti, and as of today, you know, they have not contacted me.
[01:56:01.676 --> 01:56:06.481]  Now we got in contact with you because you copied us on an email to lawmakers in your city.
[01:56:06.501 --> 01:56:07.082]  It just happened.
[01:56:07.122 --> 01:56:12.728]  I saw it in the inbox and was so shocked by these pictures and you were nice enough to come on and tell us.
[01:56:13.409 --> 01:56:16.793]  What does it say about your lawmakers that they don't even respond to you?
[01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:26.233]  You know, it's so disheartening to know that, you know, we're kind of at the bottom of the totem pole.
[01:56:26.753 --> 01:56:31.855]  We have a very good relationship with our senior lead officer in our area.
[01:56:32.656 --> 01:56:39.458]  And he is the only one, if anything positive does happen, it's only because of him personally.
[01:56:40.279 --> 01:56:43.840]  My calls to the city just, they go unanswered.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.841]  Or it goes from one to the other.
[01:56:45.981 --> 01:56:46.501]  Do they not know?
[01:56:46.901 --> 01:56:55.298]  I mean, so Garcetti, your mayor lives there and the city is falling apart and as you're, again on the screen, raw sewage in the street.
[01:56:55.338 --> 01:56:55.478]  Yes.
[01:56:55.679 --> 01:56:58.043]  I mean, what's their explanation for this?
[01:56:59.705 --> 01:57:05.968]  Well, I would love to hear it, but like I said, they will not contact me.
[01:57:06.809 --> 01:57:22.877]  And, you know, I would love to have a discussion about, you have invited them here to live on our streets and our sidewalks by disregarding the laws that are actually in place and not letting our law enforcement actually enforce these laws.
[01:57:22.897 --> 01:57:23.617]  Alright, we gotta go to break.
[01:57:23.637 --> 01:57:25.318]  We gotta go to break, but if you're a TV viewer, you're seeing this.
[01:57:26.138 --> 01:57:29.001]  Feces flowing down the street and rivers, giant piles of trash.
[01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:30.642]  I was just in LA a few weeks ago.
[01:57:30.662 --> 01:57:33.585]  We're gonna put a report out next week on it at Skid Row.
[01:57:34.186 --> 01:57:35.907]  It was ten times worse than I thought.
[01:57:36.528 --> 01:57:49.640]  Because there were half-naked transgendered people that looked like Day of the Dead zombies with rolls of weird fat and skin hanging down, having sex in front of us over piles of feces and half-eaten chicken bones.
[01:57:52.332 --> 01:58:01.215]  Globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[01:58:01.676 --> 01:58:11.079]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels or oligopolies.
[01:58:11.459 --> 01:58:15.621]  Groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[01:58:16.141 --> 01:58:19.143]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[01:58:19.583 --> 01:58:29.530]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:33.792]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[01:58:34.233 --> 01:58:36.074]  And that's why the globalists who were arrogant
[01:58:36.254 --> 01:58:36.554]  I don't know.
[01:58:51.812 --> 01:58:55.194]  The modern Paul Revere transmission of this republic.
[01:58:55.675 --> 01:59:11.005]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching or listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated and this restoration of the republic could be defeated.
[01:59:11.405 --> 01:59:16.289]  So please keep spreading the word and whatever you do, remember we're only financed now by you.
[01:59:16.829 --> 01:59:17.629]  We're in your hands.
[01:59:17.649 --> 01:59:18.930]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:59:56.386 --> 02:00:00.348]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.923 --> 02:00:32.509]  Alright, I'm going to take Trump to the woodshed about his vaccine comments here in the next segment.
[02:00:32.529 --> 02:00:45.362]  And then I'm going to get into the real story behind their attempt to get rid of the Secretary of Defense over criticism of the fraud that is the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
[02:00:46.363 --> 02:00:47.505]  And that failure, this is big.
[02:00:47.525 --> 02:00:49.069]  We're going to hit that next segment.
[02:00:49.630 --> 02:00:51.013]  And the Eric Bolling interview is coming up.
[02:00:51.073 --> 02:00:57.205]  And then, always kicking major booty, the one, the only, Dr. Nick Baggage, coming up.
[02:00:58.948 --> 02:01:05.814]  I want to go to this report from OAN from a few days ago I didn't get to because it really boils it down with one of the reporters from Mexico.
[02:01:06.714 --> 02:01:08.616]  Possible standoff brewing between the U.S.
[02:01:08.656 --> 02:01:17.903]  and Mexico after border incident and now all this ties together and it goes to the last segment showing the globalists are purposely collapsing our southern border.
[02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:22.068]  And I know you know that as an audience, but this is really going on.
[02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:34.042]  This is the globalist assault to bring down our economy, to bring down our system, to send the most uneducated, the most underpaid, the most unskilled, the most diseased here to bring down our nation.
[02:01:34.062 --> 02:01:36.926]  Then we'll come back, and I'll blitz through these stories, and then...
[02:01:38.052 --> 02:01:44.117]  We will get to the Eric Bolling extremely powerful and informative interview all here at InfoWars.
[02:01:44.178 --> 02:01:45.779]  And again, I want to thank the audience.
[02:01:45.859 --> 02:01:46.960]  I want to praise the audience.
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:48.662]  And I also want to beg the audience.
[02:01:48.982 --> 02:01:49.642]  I am in your hands.
[02:01:49.683 --> 02:01:52.345]  Without you, we do not continue to operate.
[02:01:52.625 --> 02:01:53.386]  Here is the report.
[02:01:54.167 --> 02:02:00.512]  Well, meantime, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is speaking out in the wake of a military incident at the U.S.
[02:02:00.532 --> 02:02:00.833]  border.
[02:02:01.233 --> 02:02:03.275]  One America's Christian Rose looks into the matter.
[02:02:07.549 --> 02:02:14.374]  The immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is threatening to escalate into a full-scale standoff between the two countries.
[02:02:14.914 --> 02:02:26.982]  In a fiery exchange Wednesday, President Trump and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador expressed outrage over a border incident that reportedly took place on April the 13th.
[02:02:27.322 --> 02:02:31.285]  President Trump accused Mexican soldiers of pointing guns at U.S.
[02:02:31.345 --> 02:02:37.229]  National Guardsmen working to secure the border in Texas, a claim dismissed by Lopez Obrador
[02:02:37.649 --> 02:02:38.630]  As a provocation.
[02:02:41.292 --> 02:02:43.174]  We are going to analyze this incident.
[02:02:43.434 --> 02:02:49.599]  We will take into account what he is pointing out and will act in accordance with the law within the framework of our sovereignty.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:53.543]  However, the Mexican president did not deny the incident took place.
[02:02:54.023 --> 02:03:01.750]  He said Mexico will take every effort to protect its sovereignty amidst the ongoing dispute over migrant caravans from Central America.
[02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:02.770]  The U.S.
[02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:07.954]  wants to keep the migrants in Mexico, while Mexico has sought to quickly transfer them to the U.S.
[02:03:08.454 --> 02:03:12.396]  or, more recently, deport members of caravans to their countries of origin.
[02:03:12.416 --> 02:03:17.039]  In this light, Mexico isn't quite as excited over tighter security at the U.S.
[02:03:17.099 --> 02:03:21.802]  border either, as this would keep thousands of raging migrants in Mexico.
[02:03:22.142 --> 02:03:23.944]  Mexico can stop them if they want.
[02:03:24.564 --> 02:03:25.765]  We're going to tariff the cars.
[02:03:25.985 --> 02:03:28.487]  And I will do it, just like you know I will do it.
[02:03:28.728 --> 02:03:29.488]  I don't play games.
[02:03:30.309 --> 02:03:30.769]  I'll do it.
[02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:32.731]  So we're doing it to stop people.
[02:03:33.011 --> 02:03:40.257]  Despite the slightest sign of fraying ties, there is too much at stake for Mexico to risk a full-scale confrontation with the US.
[02:03:40.798 --> 02:03:49.065]  The USMCA trade accord appears to have been the main reason Mexico has ramped up its crackdown on migrant caravans over the past few weeks.
[02:03:49.705 --> 02:03:50.266]  We're good to go.
[02:04:12.373 --> 02:04:14.914]  We are not going to fight with the United States government.
[02:04:15.374 --> 02:04:22.098]  The most important thing is to say that we want a relationship of mutual respect, cooperation, and development.
[02:04:22.478 --> 02:04:25.580]  However, his policies fall short from backing up that claim.
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:30.903]  The Mexican president has previously said his country will continue to help migrants get to the U.S.
[02:04:31.303 --> 02:04:34.705]  and voiced opposition to President Trump's plans to close the border.
[02:04:34.985 --> 02:04:36.446]  I'm gonna have to call up more military.
[02:04:38.186 --> 02:04:41.427]  But our military, don't forget, can't act like a military would act.
[02:04:41.447 --> 02:04:45.789]  Because if they got a little rough, everybody would go crazy.
[02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:47.649]  But President Trump says U.S.
[02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:55.092]  troops working at the border will now be armed, in a clear warning to Mexico against trying to disrupt their activity.
[02:04:55.612 --> 02:05:01.354]  In this light, Mexico finds itself under rising pressure to tackle the issue of caravans once
[02:05:04.690 --> 02:05:09.395]  Please remember that we're listener-supported and wear your colors proud.
[02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:11.357]  They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:12.858]  Supposed to end a day ago?
[02:05:12.918 --> 02:05:13.259]  It didn't.
[02:05:13.359 --> 02:05:13.899]  It's still there.
[02:05:13.959 --> 02:05:14.640]  Take advantage of it.
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:17.763]  Also, Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 25% off.

[02:05:21.727 --> 02:05:23.389]  We got chill and we got raging.
[02:05:23.469 --> 02:05:25.771]  We've got it both right now at a great deal.
[02:05:25.791 --> 02:05:28.734]  Get Brain Force 25% off and get a free bottle of Knockout.
[02:05:28.874 --> 02:05:29.855]  We're good to go.
[02:05:44.048 --> 02:05:46.209]  They're both different formulas, but both very strong.
[02:05:46.349 --> 02:05:47.469]  Tell us which one you like the best.
[02:05:47.529 --> 02:05:53.051]  Get them both at half off, so you can experience both of them at half off, so you can see which one you like best, or take them together.
[02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:56.333]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:56.413 --> 02:05:57.473]  But whatever you do, take action!
[02:06:16.084 --> 02:06:19.885]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:20.385 --> 02:06:21.625]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.816 --> 02:06:52.421]  Too much incredible news going on on this planet to have any problem with not having enough news.
[02:06:53.401 --> 02:06:54.322]  It's the opposite here.
[02:06:54.342 --> 02:06:57.644]  I want to hit two big issues right now.
[02:06:57.664 --> 02:07:02.708]  I think it's the big Eric Bolling interview that is very, very touching, especially at the front of it.
[02:07:02.728 --> 02:07:04.189]  I think it's very, very serious.
[02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:08.632]  I mean, this guy's good friends with Trump, has dinner with him all the time, you know, hangs out at the White House with him.
[02:07:08.852 --> 02:07:13.416]  They're good friends for a long time before he was president, and he's got a lot of the inside baseball.
[02:07:14.690 --> 02:07:15.550]  Just leaving it at that.
[02:07:15.570 --> 02:07:24.973]  And I was able to ask him, I said, so I've talked to this reporter and this person and that person that just were at the Oval Office in private meetings with the President, and they said it's not a secret, they can talk about it.
[02:07:25.573 --> 02:07:27.553]  But they've chosen not to because of the heat they'll get.
[02:07:28.454 --> 02:07:31.154]  But he intends to indict the deep state and go to war.
[02:07:31.194 --> 02:07:32.855]  And he said, no, that's it, he intends to do it.
[02:07:35.935 --> 02:07:41.597]  So, there's a lot going on, ladies and gentlemen, a lot going on.
[02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:44.563]  But let me just point this out.
[02:07:45.044 --> 02:07:55.754]  Everybody from Kit Daniels, to Paul Joseph Watson, to Adon Salazar, to Kellen McBrain, to Jamie White, to Ben.
[02:07:56.114 --> 02:08:04.823]  Sometimes I don't want to plug our writers because they get attacked when I talk about them on air, but they write all these incredible stories.
[02:08:07.611 --> 02:08:08.412]  We're good to go.
[02:08:27.762 --> 02:08:28.722]  The establishment wins.
[02:08:29.103 --> 02:08:31.864]  So I don't just say that every segment to say that.
[02:08:32.424 --> 02:08:36.326]  We've changed the world, this audience, this crew, these hosts.
[02:08:36.626 --> 02:08:37.146]  We did it.
[02:08:37.866 --> 02:08:41.448]  We're the patriots of the globalist wars.
[02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:43.669]  We're the MVPs.
[02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:44.970]  We're the team that keeps winning.
[02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:47.531]  But let me tell you, we're under massive attack.
[02:08:49.332 --> 02:08:50.052]  Just three years ago,
[02:08:51.328 --> 02:08:57.249]  Four years ago, I'd tell the crew, we're very lucky they ignore us and don't know how big we are or have chosen to ignore us.
[02:08:57.990 --> 02:09:03.471]  Because if either they're super stupid or they're just trying to ignore us, we're moving the ball down the field.
[02:09:03.511 --> 02:09:04.611]  We're changing the discussion.
[02:09:04.651 --> 02:09:08.232]  We're putting out the whole new roadmap to bring America back and the world back.
[02:09:09.152 --> 02:09:11.833]  They finally figured it out and now the establishment says that.
[02:09:11.873 --> 02:09:13.914]  So it's not brag, it's fact.
[02:09:15.554 --> 02:09:16.434]  We're the epicenter.
[02:09:17.635 --> 02:09:18.815]  We're the center of the earthquake.
[02:09:19.636 --> 02:09:21.217]  We're the middle of the storm.
[02:09:22.037 --> 02:09:23.698]  And that means you, the audience.
[02:09:24.759 --> 02:09:34.144]  And I get chills when I say that because you are the bloodstream, the brains, the eyes, the guts, the skin, the will, the soul, the bones.
[02:09:34.784 --> 02:09:35.945]  You are the info war!
[02:09:37.166 --> 02:09:39.407]  And so when we're under attack, you're under attack.
[02:09:39.467 --> 02:09:40.648]  It's you they fear!
[02:09:41.601 --> 02:09:47.864]  We were just able, as Max Keiser said, to broker, to create a focal point of the kindling that was already there.
[02:09:47.884 --> 02:09:50.385]  And we got the sparks going when others couldn't.
[02:09:50.805 --> 02:09:51.686]  You and I together.
[02:09:52.206 --> 02:09:52.826]  You could be old.
[02:09:52.866 --> 02:09:53.446]  You could be young.
[02:09:53.466 --> 02:09:55.247]  You could be black, Hispanic, Asian, white.
[02:09:55.527 --> 02:09:56.368]  You could live in Russia.
[02:09:56.388 --> 02:09:57.188]  You could live in Mexico.
[02:09:57.468 --> 02:09:58.308]  You could live in Brazil.
[02:09:58.328 --> 02:09:59.589]  You could live in South Africa.
[02:09:59.629 --> 02:10:00.489]  You could live in Nigeria.
[02:10:00.509 --> 02:10:01.150]  You could live in England.
[02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:02.170]  You could live in Japan.
[02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:03.231]  You could live in India.
[02:10:03.511 --> 02:10:04.631]  You could live anywhere.
[02:10:04.651 --> 02:10:10.314]  If you want freedom, and you don't like liars, and you don't want AI taking over, InfoWars is the place for you.
[02:10:12.247 --> 02:10:13.288]  So let's get into it right now.
[02:10:13.548 --> 02:10:14.208]  Let's do it right now.
[02:10:14.789 --> 02:10:19.031]  It's Friday edition and I'll be back with a special report this Saturday and another report this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:10:19.051 --> 02:10:19.892]  that we always do live.
[02:10:22.693 --> 02:10:24.354]  Maybe on Christmas if it falls on the Sunday.
[02:10:25.255 --> 02:10:26.075]  Let me hit this first.
[02:10:26.155 --> 02:10:28.517]  I could spend 10 hours on this but I'm gonna give it to you quick and dirty.
[02:10:30.839 --> 02:10:41.345]  I've been following for 15 years or more the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that cost billions of dollars a piece when they were first developed, then $500 million a piece.
[02:10:41.725 --> 02:10:46.308]  But the parts, the Japanese have their 12 grounded.
[02:10:46.888 --> 02:10:50.030]  Everybody that buys them, the things aren't in the air, they're pieces of crap.
[02:10:51.468 --> 02:10:54.690]  Yeah, they're really great planes when they're working, but they can't make them work.
[02:10:55.090 --> 02:10:56.931]  It's taken over a decade to get them in the air.
[02:10:57.772 --> 02:11:07.138]  And so the new Secretary of Defense, the active Secretary of Defense, has been going around saying, the jet, when it works, is a great jet, but it costs ten times the other better fighters.
[02:11:07.538 --> 02:11:08.999]  Boeing makes the F-18 and F-15.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.861]  And he said, we need new generations of fighters.
[02:11:12.101 --> 02:11:13.642]  Boeing isn't even really developing one.
[02:11:14.002 --> 02:11:15.884]  He said, we need to do something.
[02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:22.814]  They come out and act like he is fighting the other big defense contracting company.
[02:11:23.274 --> 02:11:24.676]  Well, I've been following this forever.
[02:11:24.716 --> 02:11:25.116]  He's not.
[02:11:25.156 --> 02:11:33.903]  So they did this big investigation and found that none of what he supposedly said to generals and to admirals and to the Air Force people was true.
[02:11:33.923 --> 02:11:35.824]  In fact, they all agree.
[02:11:35.965 --> 02:11:40.408]  They said that the plane, when it's operating, is really amazing, but it's like the space shuttle.
[02:11:41.489 --> 02:11:44.011]  You got to have a NASA level crew to make one of the damn things work.
[02:11:44.311 --> 02:11:47.274]  Yeah, it's a super next level plane, but it's just not
[02:11:48.656 --> 02:11:55.921]  Maybe you could shoot down two F-18 Hornets, but you could buy 15 F-18 Hornets, train them, equip them.
[02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:58.483]  15 F-18 Hornets will shoot six or seven of these down.
[02:11:59.243 --> 02:12:05.548]  And the Chinese are going to throw a bunch of stolen tech they got that's older generation against us, and we'll get our ass kicked.
[02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.849]  So...
[02:12:08.072 --> 02:12:17.896]  You read the articles, though it reminded me, the Democrats, this is NBC News, said anonymous report, just an anonymous phone call, like, Brett Kavanaugh raped me!
[02:12:18.136 --> 02:12:18.937]  A six-woman call.
[02:12:18.977 --> 02:12:21.298]  We don't know who she is, but they say that, you know, you raped her.
[02:12:23.575 --> 02:12:47.300]  Going back to February 7th, an attorney from the Senate Armed Services Committee forwarded an anonymous allegation that Shanahan, the acting Secretary of Defense, tried to force the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Robert Neller, to buy Boeing F-A-18s, and threatened to cut other Air Force programs unless the Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldson, supported buying F-15s.
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.360]  They went and interviewed him, totally made up.
[02:12:50.841 --> 02:12:51.961]  But the point is, you read this,
[02:12:54.122 --> 02:12:58.204]  Senator Warren got involved just to get Trump, just because this guy's pro-Trump.
[02:12:58.544 --> 02:12:59.865]  They just make all this crap up.
[02:13:00.445 --> 02:13:02.887]  We need to scrap the F-18.
[02:13:03.707 --> 02:13:05.408]  I know foreign governments are buying them.
[02:13:05.748 --> 02:13:06.569]  I understand all that.
[02:13:07.349 --> 02:13:09.190]  We need real weapons that work, okay?
[02:13:09.610 --> 02:13:10.331]  We don't need crap.
[02:13:12.152 --> 02:13:13.672]  And most of them are grounded.
[02:13:15.453 --> 02:13:17.955]  It costs tens of millions of dollars to get them in the air.
[02:13:18.875 --> 02:13:19.936]  It's not good.
[02:13:21.073 --> 02:13:22.394]  The program is old.
[02:13:22.454 --> 02:13:26.357]  It's built on what they thought was cutting-edge technology 15 years ago.
[02:13:26.897 --> 02:13:28.819]  They keep trying to cobble new things onto it.
[02:13:29.039 --> 02:13:30.340]  They need to start over.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:32.261]  They need to throw it in the trash can.
[02:13:33.342 --> 02:13:34.122]  That's what needs to happen.
[02:13:35.503 --> 02:13:42.168]  Suddenly the Democrats, if you even try to get good parts for something and say at least the aircraft should be in the air, you're a traitor.
[02:13:42.808 --> 02:13:43.369]  Now moving on.
[02:13:44.502 --> 02:13:53.428]  President Trump famously tweeted over and over again that autism is exploding, he knows people whose kids have gotten brain damage after taking vaccines, that you should read the inserts, that they give too many too early.
[02:13:54.469 --> 02:14:04.075]  But under all the measles hysteria from California and New York, some colleges are declaring quarantine for people that have measles, when you usually just get a fever and a few spots on you.
[02:14:04.315 --> 02:14:05.416]  Very rarely causes death.
[02:14:05.956 --> 02:14:07.137]  Walking across the street is more dangerous.
[02:14:07.497 --> 02:14:09.939]  He came out in a tweet and said, everyone needs to take the measles shot.
[02:14:11.158 --> 02:14:15.341]  Trump, you know Barron got brain damage but came back from it from getting the MMR shot at 18 months.
[02:14:15.821 --> 02:14:16.742]  You know all of this.
[02:14:18.002 --> 02:14:21.705]  They admit in New York and California it's illegal aliens that are spreading the measles.
[02:14:21.965 --> 02:14:22.745]  It's running water.
[02:14:23.046 --> 02:14:24.807]  It's hygiene that stopped all these things.
[02:14:25.187 --> 02:14:25.967]  Not the vaccines.
[02:14:26.007 --> 02:14:28.569]  A lot of people that have had the measles shot are getting it.
[02:14:30.090 --> 02:14:36.974]  My dad, before he retired as a doctor, said everybody he knew that had shingles had just taken the shot a month before or a week before.
[02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:37.655]  Mr. President?
[02:14:39.417 --> 02:14:42.800]  Trump says people have to be vaccinated amid measles outbreak.
[02:14:43.020 --> 02:14:45.282]  So he's going along with forced inoculation, it sounds like.
[02:14:45.362 --> 02:14:46.243]  Very dangerous.
[02:14:46.724 --> 02:14:54.090]  Earlier he said, I'm not saying to not give vaccines, I'm just saying give them small doses over a long period of time, not one massive dose to a child.
[02:14:54.150 --> 02:14:55.251]  That is the bare minimum.
[02:14:55.692 --> 02:14:57.613]  And that's what Trump said years ago.
[02:14:58.094 --> 02:15:00.096]  And he also said again, autism is way up.
[02:15:00.616 --> 02:15:02.698]  It is a serious problem, as we mentioned.
[02:15:03.018 --> 02:15:04.279]  Now he's starting to reverse himself.
[02:15:04.339 --> 02:15:05.581]  That's not a good sign.
[02:15:06.855 --> 02:15:09.896]  Regardless, we'll cover it more today on The War Room, 3 o'clock central.
[02:15:09.916 --> 02:15:11.577]  Got a lot of special guests coming up.
[02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:23.360]  Please don't forget, we have to end this week's special this Monday or so, because it's a free bottle of the great Sleep Aid All Natural Herbs Combined Knockout.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:31.223]  That's a free bottle of that, a 25% off bottle of our great Focus Nootropic Energy Pill that's beyond anything out there for the price.
[02:15:32.370 --> 02:15:33.952]  Leading competitors are just as good.
[02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:35.053]  They cost 70, 80 bucks.
[02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:37.375]  This is as good as you're going to get.
[02:15:37.595 --> 02:15:38.796]  It's $29.95 with a free bottle of Knockout.
[02:15:39.216 --> 02:15:43.200]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:15:50.446 --> 02:15:51.467]  A lot of other specials, too.

[02:17:03.078 --> 02:17:05.400]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[02:20:06.292 --> 02:20:09.074]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.494 --> 02:20:15.757]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:20:15.857 --> 02:20:20.300]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:31.124 --> 02:20:38.447]  We're here with Eric Bolling, and of course he was very successful on Fox News, very successful on Wall Street before that, and successful in baseball too, right?
[02:20:38.507 --> 02:20:38.827]  Yes, sir.
[02:20:39.087 --> 02:20:40.808]  A lot of stuff, so quite the life.
[02:20:40.928 --> 02:20:50.392]  And you got targeted last year in another demonization campaign, just like Hannity, just like so many others have been either been removed from air or been
[02:20:51.272 --> 02:20:51.732]  Smeared.
[02:20:52.293 --> 02:21:02.219]  But I think more and more the steam is starting to run out of that because people have seen all the hoaxes and all the frauds like Russiagate and Jussie Smollett and the Covington kids.
[02:21:02.299 --> 02:21:05.461]  I really feel like the country is starting to turn around right now.
[02:21:06.182 --> 02:21:15.808]  What's your view of going through the gauntlet and then now coming back so successful with Sinclair and so successful with the stuff you're doing with BlazeTV?
[02:21:16.008 --> 02:21:16.748]  So here's what happened.
[02:21:16.768 --> 02:21:18.630]  So yeah, there was a big smear campaign.
[02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:19.150]  It happened.
[02:21:21.051 --> 02:21:24.052]  I lost my son simultaneous with that campaign.
[02:21:24.772 --> 02:21:26.212]  I spent a year trying to recover.
[02:21:27.713 --> 02:21:28.893]  I started to come back.
[02:21:29.153 --> 02:21:30.913]  Sinclair was good enough to bring me on.
[02:21:30.993 --> 02:21:32.394]  Blaze was good enough to bring me on.
[02:21:32.714 --> 02:21:36.654]  I started a new show on Sinclair that was going nationals across the country, 200 stations.
[02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:42.916]  The first week of that show, I was at the Trump Hotel having a cocktail with six friends.
[02:21:43.196 --> 02:21:46.637]  Two of them were from Cal Berkeley, the kid who got punched for wearing a MAGA hat.
[02:21:48.597 --> 02:22:02.031]  As I'm re-entering the media world on a substantial level, a guy walks through the hotel lobby on a cell phone and says to me, turns around to my table and says, Eric Bolling's son killed himself because he was embarrassed about his father.
[02:22:02.612 --> 02:22:05.695]  Now, my son didn't kill himself, he died accidentally with an overdose.
[02:22:06.796 --> 02:22:11.658]  Um, but what that was, was the left trying to get me to do something.
[02:22:11.678 --> 02:22:12.939]  I followed the guy outside.
[02:22:13.239 --> 02:22:15.960]  I had the wherewithal to start videotaping myself.
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:19.942]  All I wanted to do was punch that guy in the face, and that's what they wanted me to do.
[02:22:20.042 --> 02:22:26.925]  Turns out there was a second guy videotaping the whole incident, waiting for me to punch that guy, because he said some other nasty things on the way.
[02:22:27.966 --> 02:22:32.793]  I didn't punch him in the face, luckily, because I wouldn't be back on TV now had I done that.
[02:22:33.113 --> 02:22:37.259]  But Alex, you're right, there's a campaign on the left to try and take down
[02:22:38.470 --> 02:22:40.091]  Higher profile, conservative voices.
[02:22:40.471 --> 02:22:46.693]  Eric, since you've experienced that, you've experienced what I've experienced, obviously not the level you went through with your son.
[02:22:46.733 --> 02:22:49.654]  I have four children, it's just an obvious nightmare that I can't even imagine.
[02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:55.676]  But the way they set you up, they've done this to me over and over and over again, here in D.C.
[02:22:55.696 --> 02:22:56.496]  but also in Austin.
[02:22:56.536 --> 02:23:02.038]  I'll be in a restaurant and somebody will walk over and knock my glass over or say you're going to die, I'm going to get you.
[02:23:02.998 --> 02:23:05.882]  It just happened like a month ago in Austin at Lucy's Fried Chicken.
[02:23:06.602 --> 02:23:07.383]  He did it the second time.
[02:23:07.423 --> 02:23:08.164]  I called the manager.
[02:23:08.204 --> 02:23:08.945]  I said, please go out.
[02:23:09.326 --> 02:23:10.067]  They're outside of the table.
[02:23:10.087 --> 02:23:11.148]  They're going to probably confront me again.
[02:23:11.168 --> 02:23:12.169]  I go outside.
[02:23:12.209 --> 02:23:13.711]  They're going, you're going to die.
[02:23:13.731 --> 02:23:14.332]  F you.
[02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:15.733]  Channing, you know, die.
[02:23:16.414 --> 02:23:19.197]  I have to walk by the guy and this whole group of like seven people.
[02:23:19.778 --> 02:23:21.780]  And then I start screaming at them going, F you.
[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:26.143]  They edit the tape, put it on Reddit, it gets like 10 million views, it becomes a national story.
[02:23:26.664 --> 02:23:30.887]  The statesman though, which is liberal, sent a reporter, they talked to the managers and they said no.
[02:23:31.228 --> 02:23:32.989]  Mr. Jones wasn't thrown out, he was leaving.
[02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:36.252]  They were thrown out and they did harass him and they set him up.
[02:23:36.532 --> 02:23:39.134]  But those were just normal Democrats now.
[02:23:39.895 --> 02:23:43.800]  With their phones, their constituents are so corrupt.
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:46.503]  I know at Trump Hotel, those are probably reporters trying to set you up.
[02:23:46.644 --> 02:23:47.344]  They're swarming in there.
[02:23:47.565 --> 02:23:49.067]  But this is just regular folks.
[02:23:49.507 --> 02:23:52.010]  No, now they're... Alex, I think it's worse than the reporters.
[02:23:52.050 --> 02:23:54.293]  I think this was a left-wing...
[02:23:55.374 --> 02:23:56.095]  We're good to go.
[02:24:11.926 --> 02:24:17.673]  Let him go, walk by, but he said the one thing that would elicit a response from me, claiming my son killed him.
[02:24:17.913 --> 02:24:18.253]  He didn't.
[02:24:18.513 --> 02:24:19.154]  He's my best friend.
[02:24:19.194 --> 02:24:20.255]  My son was my best friend.
[02:24:20.616 --> 02:24:21.497]  It was so hurtful.
[02:24:21.557 --> 02:24:23.759]  I got up and I was infuriated.
[02:24:23.799 --> 02:24:24.900]  All I wanted to do was hit the guy.
[02:24:24.941 --> 02:24:26.002]  He kept looking back at me.
[02:24:26.362 --> 02:24:27.684]  He kept smiling, smiling.
[02:24:27.724 --> 02:24:28.404]  I have it on tape.
[02:24:29.125 --> 02:24:32.207]  The smartest thing I ever did was start rolling on that incident.
[02:24:32.487 --> 02:24:34.308]  Had I not rolled on it, they could have said I did anything.
[02:24:34.528 --> 02:24:38.650]  That's what I'm saying is... There was a second cameraman behind which no one even knew about until later.
[02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:43.773]  So I rolled on it and I saw, and the smiles, the smirks on their face, they were begging for me to hit them.
[02:24:44.113 --> 02:24:44.433]  I didn't.
[02:24:44.693 --> 02:24:45.354]  Thank God I didn't.
[02:24:45.714 --> 02:24:46.834]  Because I wouldn't be here right now.
[02:24:46.854 --> 02:24:52.838]  I would be back in South Carolina going, you know, I came close to the recovery.
[02:24:52.898 --> 02:24:53.538]  And that's my point.
[02:24:53.558 --> 02:24:53.918]  I don't know.
[02:24:53.938 --> 02:24:54.419]  I think they've...
[02:25:12.836 --> 02:25:13.817]  We've hit a new low.
[02:25:14.017 --> 02:25:16.478]  I think we've hit a new low in the debate in America.
[02:25:17.138 --> 02:25:20.300]  They're willing to go after, you know, kids have been always off limits.
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:30.225]  You can go after someone, you can go after their policy, you can go after their looks, what they wear, but you always left the children of the people or the entities or the media or the politicians alone.
[02:25:30.645 --> 02:25:34.367]  They've stooped, at least in my book, they've made new atrocious lows.
[02:25:37.503 --> 02:25:38.704]  We're here at the U.S.
[02:25:38.764 --> 02:25:42.629]  Capitol on the steps of freedom, democracy, liberty, right there.
[02:25:42.969 --> 02:25:44.251]  Alex, thanks for joining us again.
[02:25:44.271 --> 02:25:45.012]  Thanks for having me.
[02:25:45.112 --> 02:25:51.720]  Now, you're in town for a couple of reasons, but we have some really interesting tape that we're going to roll in and talk about in a minute.
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:52.460]  What are you here for?
[02:25:53.261 --> 02:26:01.606]  I'm here to try to bring attention to the fact that Big Tech has been caught lying, all the major companies, all four of them, to Congress, to the President.
[02:26:01.626 --> 02:26:02.286]  Who are the four companies?
[02:26:02.326 --> 02:26:02.967]  Let's just start.
[02:26:02.987 --> 02:26:06.829]  We've got Google, we've got Apple, we've got Facebook, and we've got Twitter.
[02:26:06.849 --> 02:26:09.550]  And then, of course, they've got their sub-companies, like YouTube of Google.
[02:26:10.131 --> 02:26:14.613]  So you happened to be at the White House yesterday with a bullhorn, yelling into the White House.
[02:26:14.633 --> 02:26:15.394]  What were you asking for?
[02:26:16.212 --> 02:26:31.066]  Well, I was there as a fan of the President, as a big supporter, and he's obviously talked a lot about the censorship that's going on, and the fact that CEOs have been caught on internal videos at Google saying, well, since Hillary lost, we won't let Democrats lose next time, we're going to shut down these conservatives.
[02:26:31.106 --> 02:26:33.048]  So, we have them, and we have the internal documents.
[02:26:33.448 --> 02:26:36.050]  And so, every time he has these meetings with them, they just lie to his face.
[02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:38.553]  So, I was there, bullhorning those facts at the President.
[02:26:39.073 --> 02:26:41.734]  Bring up the fact that he needs to bust him up with antitrust.
[02:26:42.035 --> 02:26:45.176]  He needs to go after him for basically meddling in elections.
[02:26:45.216 --> 02:26:47.898]  They claim the Russians meddled with no real proof of that.
[02:26:48.178 --> 02:26:52.340]  But instead we have big tech totally on the side of the Democrats and leftists.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.281]  And I didn't even know that there was an...
[02:26:54.901 --> 02:27:01.705]  Basically, a secret, unscheduled meeting that wasn't announced until after it had happened with the CEO, Jack Dorsey, of Twitter.
[02:27:01.745 --> 02:27:10.310]  And literally, synchronicity, serendipity, whatever you call it, planets align, that I was outside for 45 minutes bullhorning while the meeting was going on.
[02:27:10.770 --> 02:27:11.891]  And I'm pretty loud on a bullhorn.
[02:27:11.931 --> 02:27:13.832]  Reportedly, folks could hear some of it inside.
[02:27:13.992 --> 02:27:17.053]  So here, we're going to roll in a little tape of you on the bullhorn.
[02:27:17.154 --> 02:27:17.794]  Watch now.
[02:27:18.214 --> 02:27:19.215]  We have the evidence!
[02:27:20.274 --> 02:27:21.275]  ...of their collusion.
[02:27:21.816 --> 02:27:26.261]  We have the head of Google saying we're doing this to stop Trump winning again.
[02:27:26.281 --> 02:27:29.725]  And then they lie to Congress President Trump!
[02:27:30.526 --> 02:27:32.329]  They lie to Congress President Trump!
[02:27:33.049 --> 02:27:35.132]  And they say they've never censored anybody!
[02:27:35.452 --> 02:27:37.034]  They've never censored a conservative!
[02:27:37.334 --> 02:27:39.157]  They've never fixed a search for a result!
[02:27:43.002 --> 02:27:44.584]  And also, take a look at this.
[02:27:44.664 --> 02:27:50.593]  The president tweeted this picture, as you point out, with Jack Dorsey staring directly at the president in the Oval Office.
[02:27:50.613 --> 02:27:54.399]  He put that picture up as you were outside bullhorning, demanding.
[02:27:55.214 --> 02:27:55.654]  What again?
[02:27:56.375 --> 02:28:16.327]  Demanding that we have a real presidential executive but also congressional investigation of all the incredible proof of Twitter employees censoring conservatives, of Facebook censoring conservatives, of Google executives admitting on video and all these internal manuals that have come out that name people by name.
[02:28:16.667 --> 02:28:20.409]  Major conservative talk show host saying, we want them shut down.
[02:28:20.609 --> 02:28:26.991]  There's also statements by Twitter employees and others who are high-level managers, where they're being talked to by Project Veritas.
[02:28:27.532 --> 02:28:28.732]  And they say, well, who do you censor?
[02:28:29.112 --> 02:28:32.674]  Well, American flags and veterans and stuff like that.
[02:28:32.954 --> 02:28:36.075]  You know, these stupid rednecks, they're pro-America and stuff.
[02:28:36.616 --> 02:28:37.116]  These are quotes.
[02:28:37.816 --> 02:28:39.557]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:29:04.284 --> 02:29:09.007]  Please remember that we're listener-supported and wear your colors proud.
[02:29:09.047 --> 02:29:10.948]  They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[02:29:11.048 --> 02:29:12.449]  It's supposed to end a day ago.
[02:29:12.509 --> 02:29:12.849]  It didn't.
[02:29:12.949 --> 02:29:13.490]  It's still there.
[02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:14.210]  Take advantage of it.

[02:29:25.357 --> 02:29:28.319]  Get Brain Force 25% off and get a free bottle of Knockout.

[02:29:32.744 --> 02:29:33.344]  That's crazy.
[02:29:33.404 --> 02:29:34.085]  With a 100% satisfaction.
[02:29:43.635 --> 02:29:45.816]  They're both different formulas, but both very strong.
[02:29:45.937 --> 02:29:47.037]  Tell us which one you like the best.
[02:29:47.057 --> 02:29:51.700]  Get them both at half off so you can experience both of them at half off so you can see which one you like best.
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:52.641]  Or take them together.
[02:29:52.801 --> 02:29:55.082]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:29:55.122 --> 02:29:56.623]  But whatever you do, take action!
[02:30:12.346 --> 02:30:22.629]  Now, normally, when I drink Turbo Force, I usually like to drink it before the war room, and I get a kick, and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[02:30:22.649 --> 02:30:23.929]  I get to work out in it and everything.
[02:30:24.489 --> 02:30:28.351]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some Brain Force Plus.
[02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:36.853]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[02:30:37.153 --> 02:30:40.194]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[02:30:41.034 --> 02:30:41.935]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:41.955 --> 02:30:49.440]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:51.381]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[02:30:51.481 --> 02:30:52.282]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[02:30:52.322 --> 02:30:53.883]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[02:30:53.923 --> 02:30:58.006]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[02:30:58.166 --> 02:30:59.627]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[02:30:59.767 --> 02:31:03.590]  Me stirring a cup of turbo force has never looked so good.
[02:31:03.890 --> 02:31:09.314]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out of turbo force with this one, folks, so you better go to Infowarsstore.com immediately.
[02:31:09.334 --> 02:31:10.195]  All right, you think I got it?
[02:31:10.215 --> 02:31:12.736]  Look at the turbo force spinning so eloquently.
[02:31:12.917 --> 02:31:16.799]  Nothing to disturb it, just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[02:31:17.019 --> 02:31:22.824]  Yes, ah, I'm thinking of my turbo force and how great it's going to make me feel.
[02:31:23.564 --> 02:31:29.729]  And the pure energy that I'm gonna get from my turbo force at Infowarstore.com.
[02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:31.190]  Yes.
[02:31:32.011 --> 02:31:33.392]  Total equilibrium.
[02:31:35.094 --> 02:31:36.354]  Find your chi.
[02:31:36.575 --> 02:31:40.556]  Find the energy with TurboForce at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:41.356 --> 02:31:44.757]  I'm getting ready for a long four-hour broadcast and I need my energy.
[02:31:44.777 --> 02:31:53.480]  I'm sipping TurboForce mixed with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:55.161]  It's magic.
[02:31:56.161 --> 02:31:59.202]  It's TurboForce from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:03.018 --> 02:32:18.087]  Controlling the Human Mind, one of the most important books that I've ever written, deals with the whole concept of mind effects, mind control, going back to the historical perspective as well, as sort of the ways in which we might be able to enhance our performance.
[02:32:18.668 --> 02:32:21.970]  One of my classics, all of my books and videos are available.
[02:32:22.350 --> 02:32:24.992]  At the InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:25.032 --> 02:32:30.115]  That's a place to go, make copies of those videos, get them out to your friends, but support the InfoWars.
[02:32:30.155 --> 02:32:41.043]  This is an opportunity to not just get good information, well documented, over 1,350 footnotes in those four books, and the videos are the same quality of good information.
[02:32:41.103 --> 02:32:42.684]  Most important one out right now,
[02:32:43.184 --> 02:32:44.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:21.363 --> 02:33:32.789]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[02:33:33.089 --> 02:33:45.676]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:47.738]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:33:47.918 --> 02:33:56.986]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[02:33:57.047 --> 02:34:00.950]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[02:34:06.584 --> 02:34:16.886]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[02:34:17.146 --> 02:34:21.167]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[02:34:24.988 --> 02:34:30.529]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:34.310]  They falsely edited him.
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:39.382]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:34:40.564 --> 02:34:45.268]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:34:46.930 --> 02:34:52.875]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:34:52.935 --> 02:34:57.419]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:34:57.499 --> 02:34:59.882]  And then we get hit and say, you can no longer use our software.
[02:35:01.121 --> 02:35:03.962]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:35:04.483 --> 02:35:06.043]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:35:06.103 --> 02:35:06.944]  They just killed our stream.
[02:35:08.124 --> 02:35:08.484]  Really?
[02:35:08.604 --> 02:35:08.865]  Yep.
[02:35:08.965 --> 02:35:11.566]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:35:13.247 --> 02:35:14.987]  This is America in 2018.
[02:35:17.388 --> 02:35:22.791]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:35:25.046 --> 02:35:26.227]  Will you do nothing?
[02:35:27.167 --> 02:35:31.210]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[02:35:31.931 --> 02:35:38.975]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:35:39.916 --> 02:35:44.859]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:36:09.170 --> 02:36:12.894]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:36:13.726 --> 02:36:16.807]  Explain this to me, and we're going to pull my Twitter and Facebook.
[02:36:16.867 --> 02:36:19.128]  I started Twitter and Facebook around the same time.
[02:36:19.488 --> 02:36:22.269]  I was in the media at the time, just starting out in the media.
[02:36:22.729 --> 02:36:26.190]  So over the course of the first few years, I ran neck and neck.
[02:36:26.270 --> 02:36:28.811]  Twitter and Facebook follows were tracking evenly.
[02:36:29.171 --> 02:36:33.693]  I got to about 500,000 of each maybe three years ago, two and a half, three years ago.
[02:36:34.393 --> 02:36:37.055]  At that point, for some reason, Twitter kept going.
[02:36:37.295 --> 02:36:39.356]  I'm now 1.1 million on Twitter.
[02:36:39.716 --> 02:36:44.458]  But my Facebook plateaued at 550,000 and hasn't gone up in years.
[02:36:44.498 --> 02:36:45.359]  That's a shadow banning.
[02:36:45.579 --> 02:36:46.419]  Explain how that works.
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:49.301]  Three years ago, we were in the heat of the 2016 election.
[02:36:49.881 --> 02:36:55.184]  They started to get scared that Hillary might lose from internal polls that Big Tech was actually providing to her that came out.
[02:36:55.604 --> 02:37:00.086]  And so they started governing back, not completely shadow banning, but dialing people back about 90%.
[02:37:01.307 --> 02:37:07.573]  And later algorithms were released that all the big tech companies were working together and dialing people back even the month before the election 90%.
[02:37:07.613 --> 02:37:12.777]  Then when Hillary lost they panicked and completely shadow banned a lot of people on Facebook.
[02:37:13.177 --> 02:37:16.941]  Twitter was a little more open for a while and that's why you were able to keep growing.
[02:37:17.441 --> 02:37:21.585]  But now from all the evidence we've seen they've started to act just like Facebook and just like Google.
[02:37:22.005 --> 02:37:24.047]  But the main leader of this is Google.
[02:37:24.387 --> 02:37:30.833]  When it comes to massive control, because they have 93% of global searches, they're really able to manipulate and control.
[02:37:30.953 --> 02:37:31.594]  How do they do that?
[02:37:31.934 --> 02:37:39.380]  There's thousands of ways, but just remember last year, they listed in the 2018 election all Republicans in the state of California as Nazis.
[02:37:39.741 --> 02:37:43.925]  It said Republican Party, political affiliation, Nazi Party.
[02:37:44.545 --> 02:37:45.866]  Google officially put that up.
[02:37:45.906 --> 02:37:46.786]  Here's another way they censor.
[02:37:47.086 --> 02:37:48.667]  They don't recognize any Christian holidays.
[02:37:48.707 --> 02:37:54.410]  They've taken Easter down, but they have that little doodle at the top of Google that'll promote any leftist organization or group.
[02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:55.870]  But then there's more serious ways.
[02:37:55.930 --> 02:37:56.891]  It's the search results.
[02:37:57.411 --> 02:38:00.993]  Used to, under their algorithm, whatever was most popular was pushed to the top.
[02:38:01.033 --> 02:38:01.813]  That's when we were popular.
[02:38:02.293 --> 02:38:06.037]  Now they handpick on key political things what they want to force feed.
[02:38:06.397 --> 02:38:10.841]  It even came out in 2016 that anything negative about Hillary was being buried.
[02:38:11.201 --> 02:38:17.808]  And so they started off protecting her, now they're doing it to thousands and thousands of different topics and different names.
[02:38:18.430 --> 02:38:19.211]  I'll give you an example.
[02:38:19.351 --> 02:38:21.092]  I interviewed the president two weeks ago.
[02:38:21.693 --> 02:38:28.920]  My Facebook follows have gone down since I... gone down, gone negative by several hundred since I interviewed the president.
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:30.401]  Meanwhile, Twitter keeps growing.
[02:38:30.841 --> 02:38:32.863]  How in the world could that possibly be happening?
[02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:41.151]  For years, it had gone consistently up, and I started interviewing him, or, you know, putting up content that's friendly to the president, and it goes down.
[02:38:41.291 --> 02:38:43.133]  You're being targeted a thousand percent.
[02:38:43.293 --> 02:38:53.441]  Every time you're a threat to the Democratic Party and the swamp, every time you have a big hit interview, this happens to everybody, that's when you get shadow banned or outright banned.
[02:38:53.481 --> 02:38:56.944]  If you keep getting so successful, they're gonna just completely ban you.
[02:38:56.964 --> 02:39:03.130]  So Facebook is actually taking my account saying he's too close to the president, he's putting up content we disagree with?
[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:05.231]  I mean, this is anti-free speech.
[02:39:05.271 --> 02:39:06.652]  Well, Eric, I'm not just saying this.
[02:39:06.712 --> 02:39:15.878]  Everyone knows you got targeted with all that disinformation last year because you are friends with the president and you were already super popular and rising to the top.
[02:39:16.219 --> 02:39:17.740]  They don't want another Sean Hannity.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.421]  They don't want another person at that level.
[02:39:20.461 --> 02:39:25.445]  So they're basically suppressing you, but you're fighting back, so they're suppressing you even more.
[02:39:26.085 --> 02:39:26.866]  What are you doing now?
[02:39:26.946 --> 02:39:28.907]  You've been banned on Twitter.
[02:39:29.328 --> 02:39:30.208]  Is that still in effect?
[02:39:30.268 --> 02:39:30.809]  Yes.
[02:39:31.149 --> 02:39:32.510]  Lifetime ban, in their words.
[02:39:32.530 --> 02:39:34.232]  I mean, murderers get out in 20 years.
[02:39:34.352 --> 02:39:35.252]  Lifetime ban.
[02:39:36.473 --> 02:39:37.754]  Google has restricted me.
[02:39:38.175 --> 02:39:39.796]  Total ban on Apple.
[02:39:40.096 --> 02:39:42.778]  We had over 40 million subscribers on Apple.
[02:39:42.798 --> 02:39:45.080]  That was our biggest thing with my three podcasts.
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:46.101]  Those were all banned.
[02:39:46.461 --> 02:39:48.523]  It took me like 15 years to build that up.
[02:39:49.143 --> 02:39:50.684]  That was all just blown away in one day.
[02:39:50.944 --> 02:39:54.805]  Tim Cook actually led the banning in August of last year, about nine months ago.
[02:39:55.185 --> 02:39:58.906]  He led the phone call with the other big tech heads on a Sunday night.
[02:39:59.286 --> 02:40:00.367]  And then at 3 a.m.
[02:40:00.427 --> 02:40:03.288]  on that Monday morning, I was banned on six major platforms.
[02:40:03.828 --> 02:40:07.869]  More than 80 more platforms followed, including software companies.
[02:40:07.889 --> 02:40:08.790]  What are they saying, Alex?
[02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:09.850]  Why are they banning you?
[02:40:11.719 --> 02:40:13.520]  They made up all this incredible garbage.
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:20.266]  First they said that I said no one died at the Florida shootings that year in February.
[02:40:20.366 --> 02:40:20.986]  Never said that.
[02:40:21.046 --> 02:40:22.167]  Offered a million dollar reward.
[02:40:22.247 --> 02:40:22.928]  I never said that.
[02:40:23.188 --> 02:40:28.793]  Never said that they were crisis actors there in Florida at the tragic shootings.
[02:40:28.813 --> 02:40:29.153]  Parkland?
[02:40:29.433 --> 02:40:30.254]  Parkland.
[02:40:30.454 --> 02:40:32.956]  But even if I was a crazy person and
[02:40:33.737 --> 02:40:36.438]  They said the moon was made out of cheese and nobody died there, which I didn't say.
[02:40:36.458 --> 02:40:37.518]  It should be my right to.
[02:40:37.878 --> 02:40:41.239]  But instead they said, oh my God, he said all these bad things about these kids.
[02:40:41.579 --> 02:40:43.580]  Mixing Sandy Hook in with it, which was also twisted.
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:46.301]  And so again, that's how they got me off there.
[02:40:46.381 --> 02:40:49.642]  They also said that I quote, endangered a child.
[02:40:50.362 --> 02:40:53.443]  And they showed a clip that was all of the news of that 10-year-old kid hitting that guy.
[02:40:53.763 --> 02:40:54.603]  He pushes the kid down.
[02:40:55.163 --> 02:41:00.566]  Forbes and others, you pull it up, had to do a retraction, they said that that was me pushing a kid down.
[02:41:00.586 --> 02:41:06.749]  So they found a video on YouTube from a year before of some guy pushing a kid down that hit him that had been all over the news.
[02:41:07.149 --> 02:41:11.151]  They said that was me and that was the final strike that they made the excuse.
[02:41:11.191 --> 02:41:11.771]  And that wasn't you?
[02:41:12.191 --> 02:41:12.712]  Wasn't even me!
[02:41:12.832 --> 02:41:13.012]  Right.
[02:41:14.372 --> 02:41:15.613]  Financially, they hurt you badly.
[02:41:16.233 --> 02:41:17.354]  Can you sue them for that?
[02:41:18.197 --> 02:41:19.819]  I mean, is it a free speech argument?
[02:41:20.119 --> 02:41:24.243]  By the way, Alex, let's be honest, I disagree with you on a lot of things.
[02:41:24.443 --> 02:41:24.623]  Sure.
[02:41:24.643 --> 02:41:33.832]  Some of the things that you've said in the past, 9-11, the inside job, the Sandy Hook stuff, wherever you are on it, I've disagreed with you, but I feel you have a right to say whatever you want.
[02:41:34.392 --> 02:41:34.992]  Whenever you want.
[02:41:35.112 --> 02:41:37.594]  No matter how much I agree with you or disagree with you.
[02:41:37.754 --> 02:41:38.555]  Well that's a great point.
[02:41:38.895 --> 02:41:44.038]  One thing they do though, they've done this to you and others, is they take something, they twist it, and then they make that your identity.
[02:41:44.478 --> 02:41:54.204]  So on so many of those issues, they distorted what I said about 9-11, they distorted what I said about Sandy Hook, and then they said that I said that lie about Parkland and banned me.
[02:41:54.284 --> 02:41:55.385]  When you say they, who's they?
[02:41:56.423 --> 02:42:07.608]  All the major corporate establishment media, all of those systems band together with the same talking points, and then they gang up on one personality, destroy them, and then move on to the next person.
[02:42:07.828 --> 02:42:14.070]  And yes, where Congress and the President and the courts and citizens can take action is the tortious interference.
[02:42:14.571 --> 02:42:22.214]  It's the big tech monopolies coordinating to form oligopolies, even the EU courts have ruled that, to then go in and control the market,
[02:42:23.095 --> 02:42:24.696]  And target people they don't like.
[02:42:24.937 --> 02:42:34.805]  So it's the real collusion by Big Tech to bring in this Democratic Party dictatorship, basically, with the deep state, and overthrow the president, and overthrow the election.
[02:42:35.026 --> 02:42:38.709]  So that's what this is, is Big Tech allied with the Communist Chinese and others.
[02:42:38.769 --> 02:42:47.857]  I mean, Google and Apple have moved to China, and Apple officially is on record saying they will accept a dictatorship anywhere in the world.
[02:42:47.877 --> 02:42:50.079]  Tim Cook gave a speech in Beijing.
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:55.469]  Three years ago where he said, I will accept censorship and I will accept dictatorship.
[02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:57.132]  Anybody can pull this up.
[02:42:58.034 --> 02:42:58.756]  It is incredible.
[02:42:58.856 --> 02:43:01.661]  And now they're helping Apple and Google build.
[02:43:03.874 --> 02:43:08.598]  Please remember that we're listener supported and wear your colors proud.
[02:43:08.638 --> 02:43:10.540]  They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.041]  Supposed to end a day ago?
[02:43:12.101 --> 02:43:12.421]  It didn't.
[02:43:12.542 --> 02:43:13.082]  It's still there.
[02:43:13.142 --> 02:43:13.823]  Take advantage of it.
[02:43:14.003 --> 02:43:16.945]  Also, Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 25% off.
[02:43:16.985 --> 02:43:19.508]  Get a free bottle of Knockout, the amazing sleep aid.
[02:43:19.528 --> 02:43:20.869]  So we got awake and we got sleepy.
[02:43:20.909 --> 02:43:22.570]  We got chill and we got raging.
[02:43:22.650 --> 02:43:24.952]  We've got it both right now at a great deal.
[02:43:25.072 --> 02:43:27.915]  Get Brain Force 25% off and get a free bottle of Knockout.
[02:43:28.115 --> 02:43:29.036]  We're good to go.
[02:43:43.228 --> 02:43:45.389]  They're both different formulas, but both very strong.
[02:43:45.530 --> 02:43:46.690]  Tell us which one you like the best.
[02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:51.273]  Get them both at half off, so you can experience both of them at half off, so you can see which one you like best.
[02:43:51.413 --> 02:43:52.234]  Or take them together.
[02:43:52.394 --> 02:43:57.737]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:57.957 --> 02:44:00.939]  But whatever you do, take action.
[02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:04.702]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:44:04.782 --> 02:44:05.082]  Go ahead.
[02:44:06.123 --> 02:44:07.585]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:44:07.605 --> 02:44:10.688]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:44:11.469 --> 02:44:12.590]  It just gets old, man.
[02:44:12.890 --> 02:44:14.611]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:44:15.312 --> 02:44:17.394]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:44:17.634 --> 02:44:21.618]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:44:21.638 --> 02:44:24.080]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:44:24.941 --> 02:44:27.263]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:44:27.623 --> 02:44:28.684]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:44:28.985 --> 02:44:29.865]  Us being shut down?
[02:44:30.106 --> 02:44:31.166]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:44:31.567 --> 02:44:32.628]  You know what, Alex?
[02:44:32.648 --> 02:44:33.749]  Put him on pause again.
[02:44:33.769 --> 02:44:34.589]  Hey, Frank!
[02:44:34.869 --> 02:44:40.214]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:44:40.534 --> 02:44:44.798]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:44:45.038 --> 02:44:47.920]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:44:48.181 --> 02:44:48.561]  You understand?
[02:44:48.641 --> 02:44:49.922]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:50.282 --> 02:44:51.403]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:52.404 --> 02:44:57.347]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:44:58.288 --> 02:44:58.968]  Do you understand?
[02:44:58.988 --> 02:45:00.229]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:45:03.691 --> 02:45:08.514]  If you're a new Lester, just type in Pentagon tested gay bomb on Iraq.
[02:45:08.814 --> 02:45:10.595]  They considered, no, they didn't consider using it.
[02:45:10.795 --> 02:45:11.996]  They've used it on our troops.
[02:45:12.356 --> 02:45:14.617]  In Vietnam, they'd spray PCP on the troops.
[02:45:14.697 --> 02:45:15.418]  Jacob's Ladder.
[02:45:16.438 --> 02:45:19.980]  You think PCP, some horse tranquilizer something?
[02:45:20.461 --> 02:45:21.021]  They got stuff.
[02:45:21.408 --> 02:45:23.330]  Don't whack your brain permanently.
[02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:24.891]  Brain chips and the trips.
[02:45:25.252 --> 02:45:30.156]  They give the trips special vaccines that are really nanotech that already re-engineer their brains.
[02:45:30.637 --> 02:45:31.958]  Now there it is, the gay bomb.
[02:45:32.218 --> 02:45:33.079]  Look it up for yourself.
[02:45:33.139 --> 02:45:35.701]  I mean, this is what they're... What do you think tap water is?
[02:45:35.762 --> 02:45:36.963]  It's a gay bomb, baby.
[02:45:37.183 --> 02:45:40.246]  And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings.
[02:45:40.546 --> 02:45:42.248]  I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly.
[02:45:42.368 --> 02:45:43.369]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:45:46.266 --> 02:45:48.673]  Some up here bashing it because I don't like gay people.
[02:45:48.974 --> 02:45:52.945]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay!
[02:46:02.023 --> 02:46:07.447]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[02:46:07.767 --> 02:46:08.347]  Alpha Power.
[02:46:08.807 --> 02:46:11.990]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[02:46:12.270 --> 02:46:20.815]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula, we can help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.
[02:46:21.175 --> 02:46:29.361]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[02:46:29.941 --> 02:46:34.922]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[02:46:35.362 --> 02:46:42.044]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[02:46:42.604 --> 02:46:45.865]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[02:46:46.285 --> 02:46:48.906]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[02:46:49.326 --> 02:46:53.067]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[02:46:53.367 --> 02:46:55.868]  Head to infowarsstore.com today.
[02:47:06.287 --> 02:47:09.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.494 --> 02:47:21.257]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:47:23.378 --> 02:47:31.083]  They're helping Apple and Google build all these surveillance grids in communist China and help suppress the... I'm just sitting here brainstorming as we talk.
[02:47:31.403 --> 02:47:34.225]  You know, Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter
[02:47:34.918 --> 02:47:35.718]  Couldn't get together.
[02:47:35.758 --> 02:47:38.039]  They couldn't merge as a business entity.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.040]  It would be antitrust.
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:39.820]  They'd be too big.
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:46.043]  Why in the world would they be able to gang up and merge against a business or a private system like you?
[02:47:46.223 --> 02:47:47.644]  Or the Republican Party?
[02:47:48.124 --> 02:47:49.185]  See, that's bingo right there.
[02:47:49.265 --> 02:47:49.565]  Bingo.
[02:47:50.305 --> 02:47:53.928]  Or the Republican Party, or a president, or any other corporation they want to shut down.
[02:47:53.968 --> 02:47:54.268]  That's it.
[02:47:54.308 --> 02:47:56.730]  It's a cartel, monopoly, oligopoly.
[02:47:56.750 --> 02:48:01.854]  An oligopoly is a group of monopolies joining forces to take over the entire system.
[02:48:02.155 --> 02:48:08.780]  So it's not just a monopoly over the phones, or a monopoly over the water in your town, or a monopoly over the cable, or a monopoly over the grocery store.
[02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:09.460]  Those are all bad.
[02:48:09.721 --> 02:48:13.023]  When they join forces, they're called cartels or oligopolies.
[02:48:13.463 --> 02:48:17.387]  And so we have criminal mega-cartels, the biggest the world's ever seen,
[02:48:18.067 --> 02:48:25.369]  Completely censoring and dialing back and governing, in the classic sense, what people can say, and that's how they can be stopped.
[02:48:25.489 --> 02:48:30.751]  And the other thing is, Alex, look, I'm sure something is going on in my Facebook.
[02:48:30.831 --> 02:48:31.511]  I'm positive.
[02:48:31.951 --> 02:48:33.871]  I'm a statistical animal.
[02:48:33.971 --> 02:48:34.812]  I love statistics.
[02:48:34.892 --> 02:48:38.893]  I eat them, I drink them, I sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night calling my producers about statistics.
[02:48:39.213 --> 02:48:43.834]  There's no physical, there's no logical way this could be happening with my Twitter versus my Facebook.
[02:48:44.094 --> 02:48:45.275]  They must be doing something.
[02:48:45.315 --> 02:48:46.355]  But here's what we tend to do.
[02:48:46.975 --> 02:48:53.557]  If they remove the governor, if they remove the thumb on the scale, then we're happy and we move on and we don't call them out on it.
[02:48:53.657 --> 02:48:54.577]  You're doing something different.
[02:48:55.157 --> 02:48:56.278]  Well, that's exactly what happened.
[02:48:56.358 --> 02:49:03.920]  In the last decade, we went from 90% of the web being little websites and we surfed the web, to 90 plus percent of traffic being on only four platforms.
[02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:10.045]  And now, instead of us directing the web for what we want, they're making the web direct us and controlling us.
[02:49:10.266 --> 02:49:12.348]  And we can't just sit there and be happy.
[02:49:12.388 --> 02:49:14.209]  These monopolies are dangerous.
[02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:17.973]  Even if they weren't abusing their authority, it's un-American and it's dangerous.
[02:49:18.013 --> 02:49:21.116]  But of course, they always abuse their monopolies.
[02:49:21.436 --> 02:49:25.680]  And now they're going from monopoly to cartel oligopoly, which is the final stage.
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.722]  So we watch them when they do it in the business world.
[02:49:27.762 --> 02:49:30.525]  We watch if they get too big, then, you know, AT&T gets broken up.
[02:49:31.425 --> 02:49:34.348]  Maybe they're at that size critical mass for the business side.
[02:49:34.789 --> 02:49:36.170]  Now they want to get into news, though.
[02:49:36.570 --> 02:49:45.679]  Now if they want to be a cartel and they want to be the purveyors of news in America, that's where it gets anti-First Amendment free speech, because they might control too much of the media.
[02:49:46.019 --> 02:49:51.145]  It's incredibly dangerous, and you've hit the nail directly on the head, and this is the debate we have to start.
[02:49:51.445 --> 02:49:53.688]  Sure, corporations can hire and fire whoever they want.
[02:49:53.908 --> 02:49:57.652]  Corporations can have their corporate culture, as long as it doesn't violate people's civil rights.
[02:49:57.912 --> 02:50:01.356]  But when they all band together, as Silicon Valley admits they do,
[02:50:02.057 --> 02:50:17.871]  Right after I got banned and they were trying to get the final group to ban me, Twitter, Jack Dorsey had a meeting with all the tech heads at the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco and it came out in BuzzFeed that they were deciding how to control conservatives and how to manipulate the 2018 election.
[02:50:18.131 --> 02:50:23.335]  So they're so arrogant they lie to Congress and say we've never censored, we've never gained results, we've never...
[02:50:23.996 --> 02:50:24.537]  We're good to go.
[02:50:39.221 --> 02:50:43.282]  He tweeted an article about how we're in a war against conservatives and have to shut them down.
[02:50:43.422 --> 02:50:46.402]  Well, he's clearly on a conservative outreach tour right now.
[02:50:46.783 --> 02:50:47.863]  He sat with the president.
[02:50:47.963 --> 02:50:50.563]  I've been asked, would we sit down and talk to Jack?
[02:50:50.883 --> 02:50:51.583]  Of course we would.
[02:50:51.864 --> 02:50:57.085]  He is trying to reach out, maybe to clean up some of the mess that that was of the last year you're talking about.
[02:50:57.105 --> 02:50:57.965]  Because they got caught.
[02:50:58.745 --> 02:51:01.866]  And because so many of their own employees' memos have come out.
[02:51:02.146 --> 02:51:03.926]  This is an open and shut case.
[02:51:05.057 --> 02:51:05.977]  They're all doing it.
[02:51:06.077 --> 02:51:07.718]  Again, Google is the ringleader.
[02:51:08.718 --> 02:51:16.020]  Apple has literally given the code keys to China, so that the Chinese government has all the Apple codes to everybody's phones.
[02:51:16.261 --> 02:51:17.561]  This is a national security crisis.
[02:51:17.781 --> 02:51:20.522]  People have heard of that big telecom... Wait, wait, wait.
[02:51:20.542 --> 02:51:21.142]  Time out, time out.
[02:51:21.582 --> 02:51:22.482]  Let's take a step back.
[02:51:23.183 --> 02:51:24.283]  I know you have a thick skin.
[02:51:26.344 --> 02:51:31.825]  Google has given the... Apple has given the codes to get into my phone to what?
[02:51:31.905 --> 02:51:33.326]  Listen in, to take pictures.
[02:51:34.537 --> 02:51:39.201]  You've heard about how Trump says that Chinese company, the second largest, 5G, is a national security threat?
[02:51:39.561 --> 02:51:39.782]  Yeah.
[02:51:39.922 --> 02:51:40.482]  It's state-run.
[02:51:40.883 --> 02:51:41.924]  It can break into everything.
[02:51:42.384 --> 02:51:43.625]  It can track everything you're doing.
[02:51:43.946 --> 02:51:45.007]  They admit it's state-run.
[02:51:45.607 --> 02:51:45.908]  Okay?
[02:51:46.488 --> 02:51:47.069]  It's the same.
[02:51:47.189 --> 02:51:55.056]  For you to become a tax-exempt company, and Apple made the decision early in 2018, you can pull it up in Reuters,
[02:51:55.837 --> 02:52:07.549]  Apple moved officially to China as their new base of operations, no longer Seattle, their main headquarters, just like Google was in Ireland, to get around taxes.
[02:52:07.589 --> 02:52:13.295]  They've moved to China because China said if you become partnered with the state, state-run, you will get 0% tax.
[02:52:13.335 --> 02:52:17.559]  So when Trump lowered corporate income tax from 40 to 20 to compete with China's 15%,
[02:52:19.261 --> 02:52:22.183]  China then went to zero if you do a partnership.
[02:52:22.423 --> 02:52:23.604]  And it's in Reuters, AP.
[02:52:23.624 --> 02:52:25.806]  Well, they require you if you want to do business in China.
[02:52:25.826 --> 02:52:26.226]  They require you.
[02:52:26.246 --> 02:52:28.127]  You have to partnership with the Chinese government.
[02:52:28.147 --> 02:52:29.428]  And so that's why Trump's pissed.
[02:52:29.749 --> 02:52:31.010]  And so it was in Reuters.
[02:52:31.090 --> 02:52:31.910]  I couldn't even believe this.
[02:52:32.411 --> 02:52:34.172]  But then it was an Apple defendant.
[02:52:34.192 --> 02:52:36.253]  They said, yes, this is just how you do business here.
[02:52:36.433 --> 02:52:46.841]  So the Chinese government was given access to all of the code keys for all Apple devices, for the cloud, for your phones, not just here, but all around the world.
[02:52:46.881 --> 02:52:48.002]  Are you making that part up?
[02:52:48.422 --> 02:52:49.425]  No, no, I swear to God.
[02:52:49.645 --> 02:52:51.970]  You're gonna tell me the Chinese have my code key to this phone?
[02:52:52.211 --> 02:52:52.371]  Yes.
[02:52:52.411 --> 02:52:55.338]  Listen, Chinese, do not hack me, or else.
[02:52:56.169 --> 02:52:57.730]  I'll get Alex on you.
[02:52:57.850 --> 02:52:59.451]  I will pull the Reuters article up for you.
[02:52:59.631 --> 02:53:00.031]  I believe you.
[02:53:00.071 --> 02:53:00.651]  I will show you.
[02:53:00.991 --> 02:53:02.992]  But you heard about the big 5G.
[02:53:03.593 --> 02:53:05.874]  5G, by the way, we're on 5G right here in D.C.
[02:53:06.154 --> 02:53:06.975]  That's the rollout.
[02:53:07.055 --> 02:53:08.895]  Rollout is starting in D.C.
[02:53:08.915 --> 02:53:11.457]  and it's going to eventually be in many, many markets.
[02:53:11.797 --> 02:53:12.737]  I think 200 markets.
[02:53:12.797 --> 02:53:14.698]  And that's American 5G.
[02:53:15.179 --> 02:53:15.639]  5G right here.
[02:53:15.699 --> 02:53:23.183]  That's why they declared national security crisis over this Chinese state-run company that's the second largest in the world because they're rolling it out at below cost.
[02:53:24.545 --> 02:53:29.407]  Again, with a monopoly to have a monopoly over the control of our 5G.
[02:53:29.747 --> 02:53:39.931]  So that's why Trump's saying no, because it is a monopoly practice of a government to militarily capture control of our communications grid and be able to break into everything through the 5G overlay.
[02:53:39.951 --> 02:53:40.132]  All right.
[02:53:40.332 --> 02:53:40.552]  All right.
[02:53:40.612 --> 02:53:44.173]  Now we've blown through way over my brainpower right now.
[02:53:44.573 --> 02:53:45.774]  A couple of news stories.
[02:53:45.814 --> 02:53:46.414]  Mueller report.
[02:53:46.454 --> 02:53:50.516]  Give us the Alex Jones's two cents on what happened with Mueller, where we go from here.
[02:53:51.624 --> 02:53:57.167]  Mueller, the Democrats, the Deep State, McCabe, Comey, all of them got directed by Obama and Hillary.
[02:53:57.287 --> 02:53:59.028]  It came out in the FISA Court warrants.
[02:53:59.809 --> 02:54:05.993]  Two years ago, the FISA Court put out a report saying that it's fraudulent.
[02:54:07.076 --> 02:54:08.037]  Put her, put her on camera.
[02:54:08.057 --> 02:54:08.177]  What?
[02:54:08.197 --> 02:54:08.677]  Come on over here.
[02:54:08.697 --> 02:54:09.178]  Yeah, come on.
[02:54:09.278 --> 02:54:09.818]  Come on, talk to us.
[02:54:09.838 --> 02:54:10.379]  No, no, talk to us over there.
[02:54:10.419 --> 02:54:11.620]  Come on, I know you have something to say.
[02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:12.080]  Let's go.
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:13.521]  Ma'am, really, we're friendly.
[02:54:13.561 --> 02:54:14.322]  You say we're liars?
[02:54:14.582 --> 02:54:14.862]  Come on.
[02:54:14.922 --> 02:54:17.404]  Okay, but so, so, but we're going to say what the Mueller Report is.
[02:54:18.585 --> 02:54:22.868]  Obama and Hillary knew that Trump was really leading in polls, but they were manipulating him.
[02:54:23.208 --> 02:54:25.770]  So they started spying on his campaign in early 2016.
[02:54:26.151 --> 02:54:28.493]  Some evidence shows even before that.
[02:54:29.153 --> 02:54:30.895]  They start spying on the campaign illegally.
[02:54:31.255 --> 02:54:35.800]  They opened up an international investigation using fraudulent information they brought to the court.
[02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:46.051]  The inspector general of the FISA court went public almost two years ago in a report that no one covered and said, we were given false information, there needs to be an investigation of this.
[02:54:46.071 --> 02:54:46.931]  So that's two years ago.
[02:54:47.714 --> 02:54:49.555]  And so, Mueller couldn't find anything.
[02:54:49.575 --> 02:54:53.638]  He couldn't find any Americans who would take money from their sting operations.
[02:54:53.678 --> 02:54:54.478]  I'm proud of our country.
[02:54:55.379 --> 02:55:07.326]  And so, at that point, Mueller didn't have any choice, and neither did Barr, because Obama and Hillary and all them had overreached so far, and committed so many crimes, that now they're the ones that are in trouble.
[02:55:07.526 --> 02:55:14.590]  And so they're lucky that this report kind of came out and whitewashed things for them, because if Trump does go after them with all the evidence he has,
[02:55:14.850 --> 02:55:16.113]  It'll be the end of the Democratic Party.
[02:55:16.333 --> 02:55:18.016]  They committed massive crimes.
[02:55:18.277 --> 02:55:25.932]  And so the Mueller report, if anything, is a whitewash of the Democrats' attempt to overthrow an elected president and to overthrow the election of the American people.
[02:55:26.994 --> 02:55:31.037]  I'm still trying to figure out how they got the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.
[02:55:31.057 --> 02:55:33.658]  It was based on a flawed document.
[02:55:34.939 --> 02:55:37.080]  And someone has to be held responsible.
[02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:38.021]  Here's why.
[02:55:38.641 --> 02:55:41.683]  Maybe you love Trump, maybe you hate Trump, but maybe Trump would do it too.
[02:55:42.103 --> 02:55:47.347]  If you're allowed to go to a FISA court with fake evidence and use it to spy on competition,
[02:55:48.084 --> 02:55:48.844]  Or someone you don't like?
[02:55:48.864 --> 02:55:49.725]  It's called fraud.
[02:55:49.785 --> 02:55:51.666]  It is fraud, but it's worse than fraud.
[02:55:51.706 --> 02:55:52.406]  It's espionage.
[02:55:52.466 --> 02:55:53.587]  It's almost treasonous.
[02:55:54.027 --> 02:55:54.768]  But who did it?
[02:55:54.908 --> 02:55:57.509]  Is it the FISA court because they allowed it?
[02:55:57.589 --> 02:56:00.551]  Or the people who brought the bad evidence to the FISA court?
[02:56:01.211 --> 02:56:02.352]  Remember just two weeks ago...
[02:56:03.092 --> 02:56:15.075]  When Trump said there needs to be criminal action taken against these groups, this was a coup, this was an attempted takedown, Clapper and Brennan both went on CNN the next day and said, we were ordered by President Obama to do it.
[02:56:15.116 --> 02:56:21.657]  And they laid out dates going back to early 2016, and they were saying, hey, presidential authority, they're scared.
[02:56:22.158 --> 02:56:26.419]  So they ran up the white flag and said, hey, we were ordered to do this, don't indict us.
[02:56:26.659 --> 02:56:27.479]  There's your proof right there.
[02:56:27.719 --> 02:56:29.020]  Obama gave the orders.
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:30.420]  It came from the president.
[02:56:31.215 --> 02:56:37.958]  And at one point, before the report was released, Brennan was on CNN saying there was evidence of collusion with the Russians.
[02:56:38.379 --> 02:56:39.839]  But there never was any evidence.
[02:56:39.879 --> 02:56:47.043]  They never found... How can an Intel guy, inside, still has access, say there's evidence and there's never been a dropout?
[02:56:47.063 --> 02:56:49.204]  Here's how you know the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[02:56:49.464 --> 02:56:50.725]  Bob Woodward wrote a book
[02:56:51.365 --> 02:56:52.006]  We're good to go.
[02:57:12.489 --> 02:57:12.710]  All right.
[02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:19.141]  Before we go, because you seem to have the inside track on a lot of things, including the Chinese having my, can unlock my iPhone.
[02:57:19.662 --> 02:57:21.525]  What's, what's going to happen next on Game of Thrones?
[02:57:22.369 --> 02:57:26.630]  You know, I really don't have a lot of time to follow Game of Thrones, but my whole family watches it, and it's all they talk about.
[02:57:26.650 --> 02:57:27.830]  Absolutely.
[02:57:28.310 --> 02:57:28.590]  Alex.
[02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:30.431]  Thick-skinned Alex Jones, everybody.
[02:57:30.811 --> 02:57:37.872]  For folks that want to find me, because I'm not off the web, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:57:37.972 --> 02:57:39.913]  Don't let them tell you what you can and can't see.
[02:57:40.213 --> 02:57:40.953]  Tune in to this guy.
[02:57:41.013 --> 02:57:44.954]  Spread the word about his show, my show, and the free independent media that's bringing this country back.
[02:57:45.334 --> 02:57:46.154]  America's back!
[02:57:47.555 --> 02:57:48.095]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:57:48.355 --> 02:57:48.615]  Thank you.
[02:57:52.236 --> 02:58:01.744]  Frank, globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:11.632]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels or oligopolies.
[02:58:11.992 --> 02:58:16.156]  Groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[02:58:16.676 --> 02:58:19.679]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[02:58:20.100 --> 02:58:30.070]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[02:58:30.671 --> 02:58:34.255]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[02:58:34.855 --> 02:58:52.041]  That's why the globalists who were arrogant are now panicking and trying to censor InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and my syndicated radio show because they know we've got our finger on the pulse of what's happening and that the President and the Pentagon and others are listening and know that we're telling the truth and we've basically become
[02:58:52.321 --> 02:58:55.723]  The modern Paul Revere transmission of this republic.
[02:58:56.203 --> 02:59:11.512]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching or listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated and this restoration of the republic could be defeated.
[02:59:11.912 --> 02:59:16.795]  So please keep spreading the word and whatever you do, remember we're only financed now by you.
[02:59:17.355 --> 02:59:18.156]  We're in your hands.

[02:59:55.216 --> 03:00:01.178]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:09.842]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:14.674 --> 03:00:16.256]  But I think it's backfiring on them.
[03:00:16.717 --> 03:00:19.420]  And I'm sorry that happened to you, them using that.
[03:00:19.440 --> 03:00:21.522]  But look what they've done to the Trump family.
[03:00:21.542 --> 03:00:23.604]  Look at the lies they've told, trying to tear this country apart.
[03:00:24.405 --> 03:00:30.612]  Now that the Russia hoax has fallen apart, and we still have people waking up, do you think there's any way for the country to at least partially heal?
[03:00:30.752 --> 03:00:32.755]  Or are the Democrats just going to keep opening the wounds?
[03:00:33.135 --> 03:00:34.476]  I think we're done.
[03:00:34.516 --> 03:00:35.136]  We're bifurcating.
[03:00:35.456 --> 03:00:36.977]  We're going to keep going.
[03:00:37.277 --> 03:00:38.097]  Look, let's be honest.
[03:00:38.137 --> 03:00:39.137]  What rates on television?
[03:00:39.177 --> 03:00:40.058]  What rates on the media?
[03:00:40.078 --> 03:00:41.618]  What rates in politics?
[03:00:41.758 --> 03:00:43.819]  I mean, you can't win being a centrist anymore.
[03:00:43.859 --> 03:00:44.480]  Polarization.
[03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:46.120]  Polarization rates across the board.
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:47.181]  It gets you elected.
[03:00:47.281 --> 03:00:47.981]  It gets you ratings.
[03:00:48.161 --> 03:00:53.783]  So I think we realize until maybe it gets so far, the pendulum swings so far, that way it comes back.
[03:00:53.823 --> 03:00:55.644]  But right now, polarization is working.
[03:00:56.104 --> 03:01:05.248]  Well, I saw Trump, because the globalists were demonizing even a country existing, polarizing Americans against the left and the globalists that say America was never great, it'll never be great.
[03:01:05.488 --> 03:01:19.455]  He had to polarize so Americans remembered who they were, but now I've seen him try to be so centrist with prison reform and all the way he's been reaching out, it's so real, like JFK-level stuff, and the left is just absolutely ignoring it, demonizing it.
[03:01:19.795 --> 03:01:23.897]  When Trump tries to pull troops out of countries and national polls, the Democrats support
[03:01:24.717 --> 03:01:26.218]  Staying in Syria.
[03:01:27.198 --> 03:01:30.240]  The Democrats support staying in a military conflict or a war.
[03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:31.080]  It's great.
[03:01:31.300 --> 03:01:32.741]  The world's flipped on its ear.
[03:01:32.781 --> 03:01:33.622]  But Trump's smart, though.
[03:01:33.942 --> 03:01:35.583]  He went to prison reform.
[03:01:35.863 --> 03:01:42.266]  That was one of their central points, tenets of the Democrat Party.
[03:01:42.286 --> 03:01:43.327]  So he took that away from them.
[03:01:43.587 --> 03:01:45.027]  He took infrastructure away from them.
[03:01:45.348 --> 03:01:47.449]  He took pulling out of foreign wars away from them.
[03:01:47.469 --> 03:01:49.130]  They don't have anything left, but we hate Trump.
[03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:51.191]  In closing, one of their
[03:01:52.111 --> 03:02:02.778]  Final big lies I still hear is Trump never really wanted to be elected, even though he campaigned harder than anybody in modern history, even though he lost hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money, being boycotted, and his golf course is attacked.
[03:02:02.858 --> 03:02:10.283]  For everybody I know that knows Trump, and you know him really well, and I've talked to him some, I mean, he's totally focused, working 16, 17 hours a day for the country to come back.
[03:02:10.383 --> 03:02:11.024]  He believes in it.
[03:02:11.444 --> 03:02:16.508]  And that hoax, I think, that he didn't really want to get elected, that's just more lies.
[03:02:16.528 --> 03:02:17.748]  Can you speak knowing him really well?
[03:02:17.768 --> 03:02:18.469]  Very well, very well.
[03:02:18.869 --> 03:02:19.790]  He wanted to be elected.
[03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:22.273]  I don't think he thought he was going to be elected.
[03:02:22.293 --> 03:02:23.374]  I'll give them that.
[03:02:23.734 --> 03:02:25.876]  I think he was surprised, as a lot of people were.
[03:02:25.916 --> 03:02:26.637]  I wasn't, you weren't.
[03:02:27.057 --> 03:02:29.820]  But I think so, the surprise, but it was a pleasant surprise.
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:31.282]  We're all, he's happy, we're happy.
[03:02:31.522 --> 03:02:34.425]  And I know the man definitely wants to get re-elected in 2020.
[03:02:34.465 --> 03:02:35.866]  Does he get re-elected?
[03:02:35.906 --> 03:02:36.207]  Yeah.
[03:02:37.648 --> 03:02:38.168]  What do you got?
[03:02:38.348 --> 03:02:43.930]  Bernie Sanders, who now thinks murderous terrorists should vote in presidential elections.
[03:02:43.970 --> 03:02:49.433]  You got Elizabeth Warren, the female Santa Claus, giving away free education.
[03:02:49.473 --> 03:02:51.314]  AOC says the world's going to end.
[03:02:51.434 --> 03:02:52.594]  AOC, 12 years, but she can't run.
[03:02:52.614 --> 03:02:55.396]  She's too young and not smart enough to run.
[03:02:55.816 --> 03:02:56.696]  No, he wins.
[03:02:56.876 --> 03:02:58.077]  He wins hands down.
[03:02:58.237 --> 03:03:03.559]  The only one that would give him a run for his money would be Michelle Obama, and she's not going to.
[03:03:03.619 --> 03:03:04.700]  You mean Michael Obama?
[03:03:05.373 --> 03:03:06.113]  No, Michelle Obama.
[03:03:06.193 --> 03:03:06.834]  It's a joke.
[03:03:07.054 --> 03:03:07.474]  I know.
[03:03:07.694 --> 03:03:09.495]  Listen, I got thick skin, you know.
[03:03:09.655 --> 03:03:11.096]  They said that I was the one that said that.
[03:03:11.136 --> 03:03:12.677]  It was Joan Rivers said she was a tranny.
[03:03:13.277 --> 03:03:14.298]  I'm staying out of this.
[03:03:14.458 --> 03:03:17.180]  Michelle Obama, the wife of Barack Obama.
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:19.161]  Tell folks how they find your shows.
[03:03:19.301 --> 03:03:21.562]  Blaze Media for Blaze TV Digital.
[03:03:21.802 --> 03:03:25.624]  And every Wednesday, Sinclair across the whole country.
[03:03:25.644 --> 03:03:28.446]  Go to your local TV station, local news station.
[03:03:28.946 --> 03:03:31.548]  Sinclair on station, likely is in your neighborhood.
[03:03:31.968 --> 03:03:33.289]  Just check out our schedule.
[03:03:33.609 --> 03:03:35.471]  You know, I said one last question, but that's too important.
[03:03:35.491 --> 03:03:49.182]  Can you get into, because Sinclair has said that they wanted to basically take Fox on, they tried to do some mergers, and speaking of antitrust, those mergers of them just buying some more TV stations and cable got blocked, which is, you know, total bull in my view.
[03:03:50.042 --> 03:03:58.109]  And now, obviously, they're going to go, word is, with a Fox lineup, five days a week with some heavy hitters, the little bird told me about, and it wasn't you.
[03:03:58.669 --> 03:04:00.070]  So, big things coming.
[03:04:00.090 --> 03:04:02.913]  Can you speak to that and the way Fox is sliding towards the left right now?
[03:04:03.493 --> 03:04:10.358]  Well, I will tell you there's an opening for a real conservative, true conservative voice.
[03:04:10.658 --> 03:04:11.419]  That's always been me.
[03:04:11.479 --> 03:04:14.021]  I want to fill that void that seems to be vacated.
[03:04:14.301 --> 03:04:16.342]  Sean does very well, but he's one guy.
[03:04:17.983 --> 03:04:18.924]  I know all of those people.
[03:04:18.964 --> 03:04:20.025]  I know where their DNA is.
[03:04:20.485 --> 03:04:22.667]  They weren't really conservative pro-Trump.
[03:04:22.707 --> 03:04:26.450]  Sean has been, but the rest of them are kind of in and out of that.
[03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.991]  I want to be that other voice.
[03:04:30.406 --> 03:04:30.986]  It's our country.
[03:04:31.006 --> 03:04:32.507]  See that thing up top?
[03:04:32.707 --> 03:04:33.207]  That's liberty.
[03:04:33.267 --> 03:04:34.147]  That's freedom right there.
[03:04:34.167 --> 03:04:35.148]  I want to be a part of that.
[03:04:35.488 --> 03:04:35.768]  All right.
[03:04:36.068 --> 03:04:36.608]  Good talking to you.
[03:04:36.628 --> 03:04:38.169]  All right.
[03:04:38.209 --> 03:04:38.589]  Great interview.
[03:04:39.089 --> 03:04:39.609]  Good stuff.
[03:04:39.629 --> 03:04:40.009]  Good stuff.
[03:04:40.109 --> 03:04:40.489]  All right, man.
[03:04:40.549 --> 03:04:42.130]  Anytime you're in Austin, come down or come up here.
[03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:45.411]  I'll call you.
[03:04:45.431 --> 03:04:49.472]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.

[03:05:03.083 --> 03:05:03.583]  You know the worst?
[03:05:04.724 --> 03:05:11.490]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:05:12.090 --> 03:05:14.652]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[03:05:15.152 --> 03:05:16.113]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[03:05:16.774 --> 03:05:18.975]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:05:19.476 --> 03:05:20.457]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:05:20.957 --> 03:05:27.002]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.

[03:05:29.924 --> 03:05:30.624]  I'm not the leader.
[03:05:30.925 --> 03:05:31.525]  You are the leader.
[03:05:31.745 --> 03:05:33.326]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:05:33.706 --> 03:05:38.469]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[03:05:39.109 --> 03:05:46.553]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.

[03:05:59.896 --> 03:06:00.336]  God bless you.
[03:06:12.871 --> 03:06:19.435]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:06:20.075 --> 03:06:22.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:28.827 --> 03:06:33.350]  For Wars.com, this is Nick Peggage, and I'm sitting in for Alex in this fourth hour.
[03:06:33.370 --> 03:06:37.493]  We just watched that interview to start up the hour.
[03:06:37.553 --> 03:06:46.440]  What a great interview in D.C., you know, really talking about the media and media control, because that seems to be the subject of the day, right?
[03:06:46.461 --> 03:06:51.304]  When you really look at what's happened with the whole last two years of media coverage,
[03:06:52.125 --> 03:06:53.526]  We're good to go.
[03:07:17.336 --> 03:07:25.281]  That means it's you and me, small guys, making contributions that are making the difference right now.
[03:07:25.541 --> 03:07:27.002]  And I think that says a lot.
[03:07:27.662 --> 03:07:39.010]  When you look at campaign contributions, you know, that's kind of one of the things that I've looked at over history, because my family's been involved, you know, a couple generations, going into the third generation of politics.
[03:07:39.370 --> 03:07:39.470]  And
[03:07:40.211 --> 03:07:42.674]  You track the money in two ways.
[03:07:42.974 --> 03:07:57.630]  One is you look for the number of donors because you really want to know is this somebody supported on a grassroots level or is this someone corporately supported where they have a very small nest of donors that are all the insiders, the elites, people with big money.
[03:07:58.791 --> 03:08:07.258]  Usually they're opposing the candidate with a broad base of donors who actually might be saying something that resonates with the average citizen.
[03:08:07.678 --> 03:08:10.500]  It's something to pay attention to in the election cycle.
[03:08:10.780 --> 03:08:20.448]  Easy to look up, find out who's running the corporate candidates, who's running the populist candidates, because populism, after all, is about you and me.
[03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:27.034]  You know, when I think about media control and what is media today, the idea of
[03:08:28.714 --> 03:08:30.295]  Just the way in which it's controlled.
[03:08:30.315 --> 03:08:36.519]  You know, I was down in Austin last week and then home in time for Easter with my family.
[03:08:36.539 --> 03:08:38.600]  And my family's a mixed group.
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:44.983]  You know, we have Democrats, Libertarians, Republicans, and Independents, the whole mix.
[03:08:45.604 --> 03:08:49.746]  And we're talking about what's going on in government, obviously.
[03:08:49.766 --> 03:08:51.427]  That's like our life's blood.
[03:08:52.287 --> 03:08:54.409]  And it turns into a lively debate most of the time.
[03:08:54.429 --> 03:08:54.769]  And you know,
[03:08:55.521 --> 03:09:00.104]  This told me how controlled the news feed is, because my family is regularly pretty informed.
[03:09:00.705 --> 03:09:09.031]  But they're not looking at the contrarian view, and I think the contrarian view, the view opposite the one we hold, is really important for all of us to know.
[03:09:09.091 --> 03:09:11.993]  Because if you're going to have a good debate, you've got to know your opposition.
[03:09:12.754 --> 03:09:23.823]  You know, the Pelosi clip that I've aired a number of times last week, I aired it again, showing, you know, the falseness of how they just literally lie and then let the media pick up the lie.
[03:09:23.883 --> 03:09:26.165]  And then they quote the media as if it's factual.
[03:09:26.185 --> 03:09:33.671]  You know, this whole concept of synthetic facts, synthetic news and then nonsense thrown back.
[03:09:34.637 --> 03:09:35.297]  It's a shock.
[03:09:35.957 --> 03:09:37.358]  Oh, no, Pelosi never said that.
[03:09:37.898 --> 03:09:41.559]  I'm going to send him the clip because they got to see it to believe it.
[03:09:41.659 --> 03:09:43.680]  And even then, it's like, what do you do with that?
[03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:48.882]  You know, when the political leadership is saying, here's how you lie to the country, that's
[03:09:50.177 --> 03:10:15.027]  The beginning of the problem and the media fails to report it efficiently because that that's really telling you know when I when we were talking to my son about this earlier today and you know the scope of when somebody makes those kind of statements and you think about the breadth of what it takes to get there to discuss the wrap-up smear as Pelosi called it how to really screw someone over so royally by
[03:10:15.851 --> 03:10:20.854]  Leaking some lie to the press, like what we just saw in this Russian nonsense for two years.
[03:10:21.174 --> 03:10:26.358]  And then the Democrats then pick that lie up and quote the press as if it's a fact.
[03:10:26.398 --> 03:10:28.899]  They call it merchandising, the idea.
[03:10:29.940 --> 03:10:32.802]  This is not government, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:32.842 --> 03:10:35.303]  This is the opposite of government.
[03:10:35.523 --> 03:10:39.165]  This is manipulation at the highest level.
[03:10:39.626 --> 03:10:44.449]  And this is why she's not doing the impeachment hearings, why that's kind of no-no.
[03:10:45.470 --> 03:10:55.037]  Is because they're seeing what the actual facts are that are coming forward now that this nonsense with Russian collusion is put to rest.
[03:10:55.097 --> 03:11:03.763]  And, you know, the Ukrainians offering up evidence now that shows Hillary was the one manipulating elections.
[03:11:04.303 --> 03:11:06.064]  Now, just look what happened in Ukraine.
[03:11:06.284 --> 03:11:11.208]  An actor, right, in a comedy show in Ukraine
[03:11:12.037 --> 03:11:15.858]  Just won 70% of the vote in Ukraine.
[03:11:15.958 --> 03:11:29.423]  If you haven't been paying attention to this, what's really wild about this, this guy who won in Ukraine had a television show that was making fun of the government and its corruption in Ukraine.
[03:11:29.483 --> 03:11:32.344]  And this guy was the hero unraveling the corruption.
[03:11:33.224 --> 03:11:40.027]  And the public voted him into the actual to run the country, to be the leader of that country.
[03:11:41.818 --> 03:11:43.880]  Think about this for a moment.
[03:11:44.982 --> 03:11:52.130]  The public, no matter where you live in the world, is so fed up with the elites.
[03:11:52.330 --> 03:11:59.098]  They'd rather take a chance on a comedian who at least they feel is speaking from his heart
[03:11:59.875 --> 03:12:04.341]  And might actually be able to put together a government that might govern for the people that live there.
[03:12:04.822 --> 03:12:06.223]  Servant of the people.
[03:12:06.283 --> 03:12:07.625]  That's the name of the show, right?
[03:12:08.146 --> 03:12:10.128]  Servant of the people.
[03:12:10.168 --> 03:12:10.889]  What a concept.
[03:12:11.270 --> 03:12:12.832]  I want to talk about that idea.
[03:12:13.092 --> 03:12:18.219]  You know, when I worked for the Anchorage School District years ago, and I'm sure the policy still doesn't exist if you want to look it up.
[03:12:18.759 --> 03:12:32.924]  But back in those days, I had proposed when I was an employee that maybe the school district school board ought to have a policy in their policy book that says the obligation of all employees within the organization is firstly to the public.
[03:12:33.904 --> 03:12:35.545]  Seems pretty straightforward, right?
[03:12:35.985 --> 03:12:41.427]  No policy that says public employees first obligation is to the public.
[03:12:41.954 --> 03:12:46.176]  Now, it was part of a whole accountability agenda I was trying to put forward at that time.
[03:12:46.216 --> 03:12:48.658]  And you know what the school board president said to me then?
[03:12:49.618 --> 03:12:52.200]  They said, ah, we can't have this policy.
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:57.002]  The leadership team thought it would be too controversial, would create too many conflicts.
[03:12:58.003 --> 03:12:58.283]  What?
[03:12:59.764 --> 03:13:00.844]  Too many conflicts.
[03:13:01.364 --> 03:13:07.908]  Because it would divide the loyalty of public servants between the public and their bosses.
[03:13:09.049 --> 03:13:09.830]  Whoa!
[03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:11.471]  Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:11.511 --> 03:13:14.434]  This is when the bureaucracy has left us.
[03:13:14.954 --> 03:13:17.897]  This is when the government has left us.
[03:13:17.997 --> 03:13:23.442]  When it's more important for an employee, our employees, to be loyal to their chain of command versus
[03:13:24.102 --> 03:13:25.823]  Being loyal to the public they serve.
[03:13:26.183 --> 03:13:40.629]  Now when I was there, we got whistleblower laws passed at the municipal level, at the state level to protect public employees so you could go forward on matters of public interest to public bodies and make your statements and be absolutely protected under the law and have some recourse.
[03:13:41.050 --> 03:13:42.290]  We need whistleblowers.
[03:13:42.930 --> 03:13:47.612]  We need institutional whistleblowers, not just against government because that's a little easier.
[03:13:47.632 --> 03:13:48.933]  You know, here we have an ombudsman.
[03:13:49.562 --> 03:13:54.626]  Sort of the people's person that has a subpoena authority that can go into our local government.
[03:13:55.047 --> 03:13:56.608]  School District was exempt at one point.
[03:13:56.628 --> 03:14:02.153]  We got that extended so that they can reach in and see what's going on within government for you.
[03:14:02.713 --> 03:14:05.776]  Ombudsman, what an interesting concept.
[03:14:06.371 --> 03:14:08.413]  We need ombudsmen for the public.
[03:14:08.473 --> 03:14:21.823]  This way you've got subpoena power, you've got confidentiality, you've got someone with the power to meet government on an equal footing and dive into the record on an equal footing so you don't see what happens to whistleblowers around the world.
[03:14:21.843 --> 03:14:35.454]  They get condemned, they get beaten up, they get holed up in embassies, they get every manner of injustice because they brought us some measure of truth that might lead to some measure of justice.
[03:14:36.295 --> 03:14:39.417]  That's what we need from the media, is the truth.
[03:14:39.657 --> 03:14:40.457]  And we don't get it.
[03:14:40.517 --> 03:14:42.638]  We get marginalized news.
[03:14:43.039 --> 03:14:47.621]  You know, CNN with lower ratings than Hallmark Channel.
[03:14:47.641 --> 03:14:50.462]  More people are interested in cartoons than CNN.
[03:14:50.943 --> 03:14:51.783]  And why is that?
[03:14:52.802 --> 03:14:57.789]  People hunger for accurate reporting, for real information that might be useful.
[03:14:57.849 --> 03:15:00.152]  That's why the alternative media is exploding.
[03:15:00.573 --> 03:15:09.826]  But at the same time, more and more people are gravitating to the narrowest bandwidth, where we're only looking at the messaging that resonates with us.
[03:15:10.266 --> 03:15:19.669]  We need to look at the opposition, understand their arguments, and then take them apart with facts, not with emotion, not with charge, with the real information.
[03:15:19.689 --> 03:15:22.030]  And that's what we're about to see over the next two years.
[03:15:22.430 --> 03:15:32.814]  We saw the circus of the Democrats who now are in for the revelation because the other shoe is about to drop.
[03:15:33.154 --> 03:15:38.896]  You know, when you think about the media being held in such low esteem by the public,
[03:15:39.989 --> 03:15:41.089]  What does that tell you?
[03:15:41.170 --> 03:15:42.710]  Where is the trust of the nation?
[03:15:43.230 --> 03:15:48.792]  Media needs to be accurate and informing and not one-sided manipulations.
[03:15:48.812 --> 03:15:49.873]  This is Dr. Nick Faggots.
[03:15:49.893 --> 03:15:52.754]  We're going to be right back after these very important messages.
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:08.483]  Please remember that we're listener-supported and wear your colors proud.
[03:16:08.523 --> 03:16:10.424]  They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[03:16:10.584 --> 03:16:11.925]  Supposed to end a day ago.
[03:16:11.985 --> 03:16:12.305]  It didn't.
[03:16:12.405 --> 03:16:12.966]  It's still there.
[03:16:13.026 --> 03:16:13.706]  Take advantage of it.
[03:16:13.886 --> 03:16:16.828]  Also, Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 25% off.
[03:16:16.868 --> 03:16:19.390]  Get a free bottle of Knockout, the amazing Sleep Aid.
[03:16:19.430 --> 03:16:20.751]  So we got awake and we got sleepy.
[03:16:20.791 --> 03:16:22.452]  We got chill and we got raging.
[03:16:22.532 --> 03:16:24.853]  We've got it both right now at a great deal.
[03:16:24.953 --> 03:16:27.795]  Get Brain Force 25% off and get a free bottle of Knockout.
[03:16:27.875 --> 03:16:28.395]  We're good to go.
[03:16:28.415 --> 03:16:29.035]  We're good to go.
[03:16:29.075 --> 03:16:29.675]  We're good to go.
[03:16:29.695 --> 03:16:30.275]  We're good to go.
[03:16:30.355 --> 03:16:30.976]  We're good to go.
[03:16:30.996 --> 03:16:31.816]  We're good to go.
[03:16:31.856 --> 03:16:32.556]  We're good to go.
[03:16:32.576 --> 03:16:33.256]  We're good to go.
[03:16:33.276 --> 03:16:34.056]  We're good to go.
[03:16:34.096 --> 03:16:35.056]  We're good to go.
[03:16:35.076 --> 03:16:35.717]  We're good to go.
[03:16:35.737 --> 03:16:36.557]  We're good to go.
[03:16:36.577 --> 03:16:37.177]  We're good to go.
[03:16:37.297 --> 03:16:37.817]  We're good to go.
[03:16:37.857 --> 03:16:38.837]  We're good to go.
[03:16:38.877 --> 03:16:39.597]  We're good to go.
[03:16:39.637 --> 03:16:40.378]  We're good to go.
[03:16:40.478 --> 03:16:41.198]  We're good to go.
[03:16:41.218 --> 03:16:41.598]  We're good to go.
[03:16:41.638 --> 03:16:42.958]  We're good to go.
[03:16:43.038 --> 03:16:43.538]  We're good to go.
[03:16:43.578 --> 03:16:44.158]  We're good to go.
[03:16:44.198 --> 03:16:44.578]  We're good to go.
[03:16:44.618 --> 03:16:45.739]  We're good to go.
[03:16:45.779 --> 03:16:46.319]  We're good to go.
[03:16:46.339 --> 03:16:47.439]  We're good to go.
[03:16:47.459 --> 03:16:48.219]  We're good to go.
[03:16:48.279 --> 03:16:48.759]  We're good to go.
[03:16:48.779 --> 03:16:49.439]  We're good to go.
[03:16:49.459 --> 03:16:50.239]  We're good to go.
[03:16:50.259 --> 03:16:50.620]  We're good to go.
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:51.340]  We're good to go.
[03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:52.020]  We're good to go.
[03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:52.700]  We're good to go.
[03:16:52.740 --> 03:16:53.960]  We're good to go.
[03:16:53.980 --> 03:16:54.840]  We're good to go.
[03:16:55.180 --> 03:16:55.621]  We're good to go.
[03:16:55.641 --> 03:16:55.781]  We're
[03:16:57.841 --> 03:17:00.772]  But whatever you do, take action!
[03:17:06.474 --> 03:17:10.398]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[03:17:10.838 --> 03:17:12.639]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:13.440]  Good to talk to you.
[03:17:13.780 --> 03:17:17.964]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:17:18.184 --> 03:17:19.926]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[03:17:20.026 --> 03:17:24.410]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:17:24.630 --> 03:17:30.955]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[03:17:31.055 --> 03:17:32.517]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:17:32.557 --> 03:17:33.097]  Tell us about it.
[03:17:33.097 --> 03:17:33.817]  Well, it's really great.
[03:17:33.837 --> 03:17:35.038]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:17:35.078 --> 03:17:35.518]  I take it.
[03:17:35.578 --> 03:17:36.179]  It tastes good.
[03:17:36.259 --> 03:17:37.939]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:17:38.019 --> 03:17:39.700]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:17:39.860 --> 03:17:43.162]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:17:43.182 --> 03:17:45.843]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:17:45.883 --> 03:17:47.424]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:17:47.564 --> 03:17:49.405]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:17:49.525 --> 03:17:50.006]  So, yeah.
[03:17:50.386 --> 03:17:52.247]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:17:52.707 --> 03:17:55.048]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[03:17:55.408 --> 03:17:56.309]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[03:20:25.724 --> 03:20:29.227]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:20:33.038 --> 03:20:35.199]  And welcome back to the Info Wars.
[03:20:35.259 --> 03:20:38.041]  This is Friday afternoon and April 26, 2019.
[03:20:38.801 --> 03:20:46.185]  You know, we've been talking a little bit about the media, kind of what's been happening the last couple of days.
[03:20:46.285 --> 03:20:51.688]  I mean, Hannity last night, we saw that last hour with Alex talking about what all went on there.
[03:20:52.993 --> 03:20:54.414]  This is the beginning.
[03:20:54.755 --> 03:21:01.904]  You know, the media generally is about the most untrusted source of information on the planet these days.
[03:21:02.324 --> 03:21:06.450]  The only other group that's probably got a lower rating with the public is the Congress itself.
[03:21:07.711 --> 03:21:20.879]  When we think about this, you know, when you think about low ratings, low trust levels for the media, and the media is running around trying to defend themselves and beat up everybody that's attacking them, this is the wrong approach, actually.
[03:21:20.899 --> 03:21:22.780]  It tells you something, you know.
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:25.481]  Just stay with the news.
[03:21:25.541 --> 03:21:27.022]  You don't need to be defending yourself.
[03:21:28.343 --> 03:21:29.884]  Defend the facts, if you have any.
[03:21:30.464 --> 03:21:32.425]  And that's been the problem with the mainstream.
[03:21:32.445 --> 03:21:36.668]  They're not doing the level of investigative reporting that the alternatives have and do.
[03:21:37.428 --> 03:21:37.789]  I think so.
[03:21:57.044 --> 03:21:59.567]  99% of the time is exactly as predicted.
[03:21:59.647 --> 03:22:04.070]  And it's not based on some weird metaphysical, esoteric formulation.
[03:22:04.090 --> 03:22:10.616]  It's just based on reviewing the facts, reviewing the information and seeing quite clearly what those facts show us.
[03:22:11.216 --> 03:22:12.858]  And that's the difference.
[03:22:12.878 --> 03:22:16.461]  You know, when you think about media right now is so worried.
[03:22:17.145 --> 03:22:20.568]  And big tech, and this is where Trump really has to nail big tech.
[03:22:21.109 --> 03:22:37.765]  It's a source of so much news, and you think about it, breaking up these monopolies and making sure everyone has equal access, that they're not able to manipulate the ratings, the data flows, so people have truly equal access to information requires that the filters
[03:22:38.545 --> 03:22:47.229]  Of the big tech companies be broken down because we know we've seen it manipulating the numbers, manipulating the way search engines work.
[03:22:47.289 --> 03:22:48.530]  It's happened to me now, right?
[03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:49.970]  Mine are being affected as well.
[03:22:50.771 --> 03:22:57.614]  Um, when you think about antitrust, how many times has the Democrats brought up antitrust?
[03:22:57.674 --> 03:22:58.734]  It's their biggest issue.
[03:22:58.794 --> 03:23:07.038]  Historically, go back 50 years, and they're not saying a word about the big tech antitrust because right now it serves them.
[03:23:08.109 --> 03:23:10.651]  But if it didn't serve them, would they be screaming the loudest?
[03:23:11.051 --> 03:23:11.952]  Of course they would.
[03:23:12.292 --> 03:23:15.174]  And this is the problem about polarized politics.
[03:23:15.634 --> 03:23:18.176]  These are fundamental, whether you're on the right or the left.
[03:23:18.236 --> 03:23:22.959]  Freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of discourse is really what it's about.
[03:23:23.300 --> 03:23:33.767]  Whether it's religion, politics, the arts, science, whatever that is, we should be free to have that discourse in the public square of the 21st century, which is here.
[03:23:34.327 --> 03:23:41.392]  Through the internet, through radio, through the wireless systems of communication, and nothing should restrict those.
[03:23:41.532 --> 03:23:48.376]  And any restriction should be dealt with criminally as an obstruction of our civil liberties and civil rights.
[03:23:48.836 --> 03:23:57.181]  If you're going to be in business, and you're going to run the media for the world, then you need to be accountable to the public that you also serve.
[03:23:57.822 --> 03:23:58.502]  You know, think about it.
[03:23:58.542 --> 03:23:59.903]  Before the break, we're talking about
[03:24:00.640 --> 03:24:06.382]  Whistleblowing, we're talking about media, the collusion and control, really, of government and media.
[03:24:06.782 --> 03:24:09.842]  Whistleblowers are a fundamental part of the media.
[03:24:10.343 --> 03:24:26.507]  That's the alliance that should be taking place, not an alliance of big government, big corporations, and big media to manipulate what we think, what we see, and what we believe, and then throwing technological overlays that even add more power to that agenda.
[03:24:27.142 --> 03:24:28.845]  The opposite needs to happen now.
[03:24:29.285 --> 03:24:40.441]  The dismantling of big tech, the flattening of the town square where we all have equal access and civil and criminal criminal penalties for the officers and big
[03:24:41.866 --> 03:24:47.730]  Boards of those corporations make them criminally liable, like what we just saw happen in the pharma industry.
[03:24:48.071 --> 03:25:02.361]  You know, one of the states, I believe, was New York, just indicted a bunch of people that are officers, people who run companies, running criminal enterprises, conspiracies to traffic in drugs, because they're the biggest opiate manufacturer and propagandist on the planet.
[03:25:02.761 --> 03:25:03.942]  The pharma industry.
[03:25:05.343 --> 03:25:06.344]  The death industry.
[03:25:07.205 --> 03:25:16.790]  You know, when you look at what's happened to big corporations, you look at what has happened to the whole configuration of government and media working against the public.
[03:25:17.631 --> 03:25:20.853]  Yeah, that's why the media is in the toilet where they belong.
[03:25:21.253 --> 03:25:27.076]  That's why the Congress is in the lowest esteem ever, because that's the way they belong.
[03:25:27.977 --> 03:25:33.600]  People do not trust the government right now, which is why the media needs to do their job.
[03:25:34.201 --> 03:25:36.582]  Do the job of InfoWars and others.
[03:25:36.923 --> 03:25:41.746]  Instead of marginalizing these networks, recognize what they've done to bring in the truth.
[03:25:42.766 --> 03:25:47.609]  And we need to protect the independent voices, even when we disagree.
[03:25:48.770 --> 03:25:49.890]  Even when we disagree!
[03:25:50.491 --> 03:25:52.792]  Because the next day is your day.
[03:25:53.533 --> 03:25:59.977]  And we're starting to see many in the left starting to recognize that the suppression of dialogue cuts both ways.
[03:26:00.017 --> 03:26:02.238]  You cannot begin down this slippery slope.
[03:26:03.055 --> 03:26:04.397]  We need to un-knot the knot.
[03:26:05.418 --> 03:26:10.243]  We need the President to recognize that these fundamental freedoms of the First Amendment are what's at stake.
[03:26:10.864 --> 03:26:17.371]  And that means our entire way of life is on the blocks this next cycle.
[03:26:17.831 --> 03:26:22.897]  This is going to be the most important election of the century, of the last hundred years in my opinion.
[03:26:23.610 --> 03:26:26.472]  Because we're either going backwards or we're going forwards.
[03:26:26.972 --> 03:26:30.154]  The Democrats are the party of the backwards nature of man.
[03:26:30.635 --> 03:26:32.236]  They want to talk about reparations.
[03:26:32.596 --> 03:26:34.457]  They want to talk about socialism.
[03:26:34.497 --> 03:26:36.258]  They want to talk about a bunch of crazy things.
[03:26:37.419 --> 03:26:38.159]  Reparations.
[03:26:38.219 --> 03:26:39.060]  Give me a break.
[03:26:39.580 --> 03:26:44.103]  You know, if you're going to have reparations for anybody, take a look at Native Americans, right?
[03:26:44.343 --> 03:26:49.206]  Who are still breathing in this generation of the screwing they got from the nation.
[03:26:49.246 --> 03:26:50.007]  But hey,
[03:26:51.064 --> 03:26:52.605]  They're not the ones asking.
[03:26:52.765 --> 03:26:54.865]  You know, we see this reparations dialogue.
[03:26:54.905 --> 03:26:57.566]  That is a divisive dialogue.
[03:26:57.907 --> 03:26:59.227]  I could say the same thing.
[03:26:59.567 --> 03:27:02.588]  The Romans invaded Croatia, where my ancestors were from.
[03:27:02.668 --> 03:27:04.749]  I want the Italians to pay me reparations.
[03:27:04.809 --> 03:27:06.030]  How crazy is that?
[03:27:06.750 --> 03:27:13.813]  Or the Turks, the Ottoman Empire, they came into Southern Europe, screwed up my whole family back 500 years ago, 600 years ago, 800 years ago.
[03:27:14.213 --> 03:27:15.973]  I should have reparations for that.
[03:27:16.694 --> 03:27:17.414]  Nonsense.
[03:27:18.274 --> 03:27:18.814]  Nonsense.
[03:27:18.854 --> 03:27:21.656]  We are living in the present and we are building a future.
[03:27:22.036 --> 03:27:26.879]  We are not going backwards because our generations past made mistakes.
[03:27:26.939 --> 03:27:28.540]  We all know what those mistakes were.
[03:27:28.920 --> 03:27:40.327]  That's why in this form of government we have something that can evolve with the value systems of the American public while maintaining those basic things that allow us to have a dialogue.
[03:27:41.286 --> 03:27:42.246]  So we have changed.
[03:27:42.286 --> 03:27:43.327]  The country has changed.
[03:27:43.667 --> 03:27:44.707]  Slavery is gone.
[03:27:44.767 --> 03:27:46.507]  It happened over 150 years ago.
[03:27:46.868 --> 03:27:48.168]  No one's alive anymore.
[03:27:48.868 --> 03:27:49.548]  That's a victim.
[03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:52.329]  We need to quit being victims of this country.
[03:27:52.729 --> 03:28:00.731]  Start recognizing that what we have is an absolute flower in the world in so many ways.
[03:28:01.372 --> 03:28:09.834]  The base value systems held by the left and the right need to be remembered and put in the forefront of what we're doing in this election cycle.
[03:28:10.549 --> 03:28:18.054]  Freedom of the press, freedom from censorship, freedom from being ratcheted down by big tech.
[03:28:18.655 --> 03:28:21.216]  That's what this next election cycle is going to be about.
[03:28:21.837 --> 03:28:23.138]  Freedom from the press.
[03:28:24.412 --> 03:28:27.515]  Not freedom of the press is what my father used to say.
[03:28:27.535 --> 03:28:32.620]  He used to also say the only bad press is an obituary and maybe in his day I would agree.
[03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:39.526]  But what has happened with the media today is a sin against this republic and needs to be changed.
[03:28:39.546 --> 03:28:45.852]  This administration needs to step up the regulation and an open dialogue and break the antitrust.
[03:28:46.252 --> 03:28:49.593]  And open the speech of this country again so we can have that dialogue.
[03:28:49.954 --> 03:28:51.974]  That's what InfoWars is all about.
[03:28:52.334 --> 03:28:54.515]  That is what InfoWars has always been about.
[03:28:54.875 --> 03:28:56.376]  And that's what you are about.
[03:28:56.636 --> 03:28:58.477]  You are the tip of this spear.
[03:29:04.588 --> 03:29:06.690]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:29:06.810 --> 03:29:13.154]  Yeah, so real quickly, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro because I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[03:29:13.174 --> 03:29:15.576]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country.
[03:29:15.596 --> 03:29:20.920]  Because you got glyphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a septic tank.
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:23.162]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[03:29:23.242 --> 03:29:25.523]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[03:29:25.784 --> 03:29:27.205]  And by the way, I forget to do this to get mad.
[03:29:27.645 --> 03:29:31.448]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[03:29:31.789 --> 03:29:35.972]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[03:29:36.152 --> 03:29:39.255]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[03:29:39.335 --> 03:29:51.766]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century, and I have zero, zero faith
[03:29:53.868 --> 03:29:58.233]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[03:29:58.393 --> 03:30:02.257]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[03:30:02.557 --> 03:30:06.301]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[03:30:06.421 --> 03:30:07.603]  And I'll never forget David Hogg.
[03:30:08.083 --> 03:30:11.224]  He goes, you know Alex Jones on C-SPAN, he goes, little anti-gun guy.
[03:30:11.384 --> 03:30:16.126]  He goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[03:30:16.306 --> 03:30:24.389]  Yeah, it's like saying your kids need vitamin C and then I sell vitamin C. Or, Jones says we need to wear shoes.
[03:30:24.609 --> 03:30:25.609]  We walk in the snow.
[03:30:26.029 --> 03:30:27.250]  Then he advertises shoes.
[03:30:27.450 --> 03:30:28.350]  Yes, exactly.
[03:30:28.670 --> 03:30:30.091]  But see, in his little brain...
[03:30:30.711 --> 03:30:32.132]  Where everything is a scam.
[03:30:32.632 --> 03:30:35.474]  He thinks I'm scamming people when it's a direct sale.
[03:30:35.614 --> 03:30:37.216]  We have the best gravity-fed systems.
[03:30:37.276 --> 03:30:39.877]  Alexa Pure and Pro Pure are apples and oranges, but they're both excellent.
[03:30:40.058 --> 03:30:40.878]  Everyone needs it.
[03:30:41.058 --> 03:30:42.279]  Everyone should filter their water.
[03:30:42.299 --> 03:30:43.660]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[03:30:43.700 --> 03:30:47.543]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant, but you need to filter your water.
[03:30:47.703 --> 03:30:49.124]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[03:30:49.204 --> 03:30:50.205]  You absorb it there.
[03:30:50.365 --> 03:30:52.967]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[03:30:53.307 --> 03:30:54.007]  Exactly.
[03:30:54.127 --> 03:30:55.909]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[03:30:56.069 --> 03:30:57.150]  It's insane!
[03:31:02.498 --> 03:31:04.139]  InfoWars.com.
[03:31:05.160 --> 03:31:06.481]  We're all Alex Jones.
[03:31:07.522 --> 03:31:09.383]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:31:10.304 --> 03:31:11.425]  Forbidden information.
[03:31:11.445 --> 03:31:13.806]  InfoWars.com.
[03:31:15.478 --> 03:31:20.422]  I just, guys, I just don't think, uh, I just don't think I have the energy today to do fourth hour.
[03:31:20.442 --> 03:31:21.923]  I just don't think I can do it, guys.
[03:31:22.363 --> 03:31:25.546]  Owen, Owen, I'm getting sick and tired of your BS during the breaks today.
[03:31:25.726 --> 03:31:27.227]  Been bitching all day off air.
[03:31:27.407 --> 03:31:28.628]  I'm tired of being a damn cuck.
[03:31:28.848 --> 03:31:33.832]  Will you just take some of the cuck package that we got here and just fix yourself, man.
[03:31:34.092 --> 03:31:34.533]  Fix it.
[03:31:34.773 --> 03:31:35.393]  I'm sick of it.
[03:31:36.861 --> 03:31:42.665]  Okay, um, I guess I'll try this, uh, Super Male Vitality?
[03:31:42.685 --> 03:31:44.125]  Alright, I'll give it a try.
[03:31:44.145 --> 03:31:46.647]  Hmm, says two droppers, okay.
[03:31:47.327 --> 03:31:48.808]  Super Male Vitality, huh?
[03:31:49.028 --> 03:31:51.850]  I don't know, I mean, I'm not totally feeling it yet.
[03:31:51.890 --> 03:31:53.771]  Let me try this, um, Alpha Power?
[03:31:53.911 --> 03:31:55.992]  From InfoWarsStore.com, huh?
[03:31:57.293 --> 03:31:59.476]  Two Alpha Power supplement pills here.
[03:31:59.576 --> 03:32:01.498]  I guess I'll just try this Alpha Power too.
[03:32:01.558 --> 03:32:02.299]  Maybe this will help.
[03:32:03.360 --> 03:32:04.221]  Alpha Power, huh?
[03:32:04.241 --> 03:32:05.782]  I think I'm starting to feel something.
[03:32:05.883 --> 03:32:10.868]  But this Super Male Vitality Alpha Power combo, I think it's starting to kick in!
[03:32:14.292 --> 03:32:14.812]  Yes!
[03:32:15.713 --> 03:32:17.075]  Yes, I feel the power now!
[03:32:28.852 --> 03:32:29.513]  That's right!
[03:32:31.793 --> 03:32:32.973]  I have been un-cucked!
[03:32:33.834 --> 03:32:37.354]  It's the Total Cuck Cleanse at InfoWarsTore.com!

[03:32:58.381 --> 03:33:01.225]  Toxic masculinity at its finest!
[03:33:06.131 --> 03:33:08.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.923 --> 03:33:29.529]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:33:35.229 --> 03:33:37.410]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:33:37.430 --> 03:33:42.792]  This is Alex Jones Show and Dr. McVeigh is standing in for Alex in this last hour.
[03:33:44.932 --> 03:33:46.853]  Man, what a couple of weeks.
[03:33:47.053 --> 03:33:57.076]  Last week I was in Austin for the week working with the team down there and we produced a bunch of segments with the different hosts and then some independent segments to go up over the next few weeks.
[03:33:59.326 --> 03:34:08.752]  The whole compression of all of this now, you know, as things sort of unravel after the Mueller report last week and what's coming from that.
[03:34:09.493 --> 03:34:11.974]  Additional indictments are sure to come.
[03:34:12.074 --> 03:34:13.115]  We're waiting on that.
[03:34:14.696 --> 03:34:18.839]  The draining of the swamp, stage two, looks like it's about to start.
[03:34:19.519 --> 03:34:22.821]  A little rash of resignations as people run out the gate.
[03:34:24.362 --> 03:34:25.823]  Let's see what happens in the next couple weeks.
[03:34:25.843 --> 03:34:27.244]  I think it's going to be a really important time.
[03:34:27.984 --> 03:34:30.065]  Let's see what the Trump administration does.
[03:34:31.345 --> 03:34:34.707]  I think that it's the standard Trump affair.
[03:34:34.727 --> 03:34:38.889]  You know, you get everyone looking over here while you're getting ready to launch over there.
[03:34:39.429 --> 03:34:42.511]  And I think that's what we're about to see, and I'm looking forward to it.
[03:34:44.051 --> 03:34:49.855]  I want to talk a little bit, too, about what's going on in the economy right now, sort of how how does all this shake out?
[03:34:50.335 --> 03:34:59.121]  You know, we're again seeing the numbers came out today, 3.2 percent growth in the first quarter, the biggest in years.
[03:34:59.982 --> 03:35:02.704]  When you think about unemployment, the lowest in 50 years.
[03:35:02.744 --> 03:35:13.771]  And then the reason they didn't predict that the economy would increase at this level again, 3.2 percent in the first quarter, is because the unemployment is so low and it's been so low.
[03:35:14.391 --> 03:35:23.115]  What they're not looking at, my son pointed this out to me earlier today, he said, look, they're not looking at how many people are coming off of the welfare rolls.
[03:35:23.155 --> 03:35:24.675]  Take a look at those numbers.
[03:35:25.376 --> 03:35:31.118]  Because of welfare reform over the last decade, and it's slowly worked its way, and there has been some things there.
[03:35:31.818 --> 03:35:35.840]  But now in this employment environment, there's great opportunities.
[03:35:35.880 --> 03:35:41.282]  People are coming off of public assistance, off of the welfare rolls, and going back to work.
[03:35:41.966 --> 03:35:45.269]  This is great for our economy on several different levels.
[03:35:45.649 --> 03:35:46.690]  Plus, just think about it.
[03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:53.375]  I mean, having the dignity of a job, getting up every day, having a place to go, being paid a decent wage, and being able to support yourself.
[03:35:53.995 --> 03:35:57.718]  You know, that's fundamental to what we are, you know, as humans working in the world.
[03:35:58.358 --> 03:35:58.558]  Yes.
[03:36:16.178 --> 03:36:16.859]  That's a hardship.
[03:36:16.879 --> 03:36:25.864]  It's one of the reasons we've got to preserve the safety nets that we do have legitimately operating in the country and quit looting them, like Social Security, which ought to help.
[03:36:25.924 --> 03:36:27.666]  I mean, that was the point of the matter in the beginning.
[03:36:27.766 --> 03:36:30.167]  What we've done is bastardize it as something else.
[03:36:32.222 --> 03:36:37.725]  You know, and that I think we need to get back to the basics of what are getting people in the workforce now.
[03:36:38.085 --> 03:36:44.268]  The opportunity of bringing in senior employees, retirees back into the workforce to draw in a couple of ways.
[03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:48.671]  One, their ability to focus and pay attention to something the newest generation is losing.
[03:36:49.151 --> 03:36:50.452]  Because of the way things are going.
[03:36:51.372 --> 03:36:59.517]  The other reason is retirement savings are being exhausted by many people raising their adult children, which we've all read about and heard about now.
[03:36:59.577 --> 03:37:03.480]  It's like 23 is sort of the average age where parents break it off.
[03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:08.543]  And some parents are paying their kids bills up into their 30s and their 40s.
[03:37:08.883 --> 03:37:11.825]  Rent, groceries, student loans, whatever.
[03:37:12.715 --> 03:37:18.998]  You know, we haven't created a self-sufficient independent generation in so many ways in the current generation.
[03:37:19.038 --> 03:37:27.401]  So they're bringing in retirees with experience, knowledge, and maybe a way to mentor the next generation into being productive employees.
[03:37:27.501 --> 03:37:31.583]  And I'm not saying that about all young people, because I can tell you what, I met
[03:37:32.404 --> 03:37:40.788]  Some in the last few weeks, particularly some really, really brilliant young men and women in the InfoWars group.
[03:37:41.168 --> 03:37:47.131]  I mean, a lot of the technicians, the writers, people working on the background, making us look good up here.
[03:37:47.891 --> 03:38:01.538]  These are all young people who understand the technologies and what it can do, but they're also driven by ideology and beliefs and ideas that make this one of the most powerful networks on the planet today.
[03:38:02.216 --> 03:38:06.719]  It's with the help of those within the organization, those of you that support the organization.
[03:38:07.159 --> 03:38:10.321]  I always forget to plug, and I want to do a couple of things today.
[03:38:10.341 --> 03:38:14.823]  I want to mention DNA Force Plus from InfoWars Life.
[03:38:14.883 --> 03:38:16.304]  It's 20% off right now.
[03:38:16.784 --> 03:38:18.025]  These are great products.
[03:38:18.185 --> 03:38:21.847]  I mean, take a look at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:38:21.887 --> 03:38:23.628]  Look at the InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:38:25.385 --> 03:38:26.586]  And check out the products.
[03:38:27.226 --> 03:38:28.247]  Get something today.
[03:38:28.527 --> 03:38:30.288]  Pass it on to the people you care about.
[03:38:30.328 --> 03:38:32.970]  You know, these are good supplements.
[03:38:32.990 --> 03:38:34.951]  They're the best in the world, the best ingredients.
[03:38:35.532 --> 03:38:35.912]  Use them.
[03:38:36.052 --> 03:38:39.674]  You get a twofer, as Alex always says, a 360 win, as he says.
[03:38:40.275 --> 03:38:41.776]  You benefit, we benefit.
[03:38:42.556 --> 03:38:45.238]  This network stays on the air, because that's the way it works here.
[03:38:45.678 --> 03:38:49.401]  You know, and you know, the media is even criticizing this.
[03:38:50.261 --> 03:38:54.544]  And you know, they exist on advertisers, which tell them what to say.
[03:38:55.282 --> 03:38:57.343]  Keir, you are the advertisers.
[03:38:57.623 --> 03:39:03.505]  You're the consumers that get the news one bottle at a time, one book at a time.
[03:39:03.905 --> 03:39:04.985]  You support this network.
[03:39:05.025 --> 03:39:07.066]  That's the best grant source in the world.
[03:39:07.446 --> 03:39:21.970]  When the public supports the network, it really reflects the message that you're looking for, which is the version of the truth that the evidence supports and recognizing that when we make mistakes, and it happens occasionally, we retract, we make the amends.
[03:39:22.650 --> 03:39:24.231]  That's something the mainstream never does.
[03:39:25.171 --> 03:39:32.835]  And you can rely on the information, you can rely on the products, you can rely on this network to bring you the best information on the planet.
[03:39:33.295 --> 03:39:45.200]  You know, when you look at everybody that contributes, you know, you've got listeners sending us data all the time, you've got a variety of hosts bringing information all the time, all with different styles, different approaches.
[03:39:45.620 --> 03:39:49.922]  And with that, we bring the information we think the public needs to hear.
[03:39:50.502 --> 03:39:55.307]  You know, thinking about the economy again and what's happening, you know, I think we still have growth.
[03:39:55.388 --> 03:40:00.153]  If the Fed can stay in their current position,
[03:40:00.731 --> 03:40:03.712]  You know, we're not seeing the inflation, the hyperinflation, nothing.
[03:40:04.172 --> 03:40:05.173]  Things are really good.
[03:40:05.633 --> 03:40:06.573]  Growth is happening.
[03:40:06.874 --> 03:40:08.974]  There's a lot of things going on in the economy.
[03:40:09.675 --> 03:40:14.097]  Now we're starting to see wages start to ratchet up after decades of stagnation.
[03:40:14.477 --> 03:40:15.257]  This is a good thing.
[03:40:15.317 --> 03:40:20.119]  This is coming from the Tax Reform Act that freed up more money domestically.
[03:40:20.139 --> 03:40:24.581]  You're seeing more automation, more investments in factories, more investments in plants.
[03:40:25.231 --> 03:40:28.413]  Because automation gives us a competitive advantage.
[03:40:28.793 --> 03:40:34.817]  Same time, you know, as all of that's happening, AI is developing, which has a two-edged sword of all technology.
[03:40:34.837 --> 03:40:36.458]  It's going to be used for us or against us.
[03:40:37.018 --> 03:40:41.841]  But the fact is, these technologies are what makes government strong.
[03:40:43.062 --> 03:40:46.944]  Command and control of technologies is what makes government strong.
[03:40:47.405 --> 03:40:52.388]  Knowledge about technologies is all of our responsibilities within democratic republics.
[03:40:53.012 --> 03:40:56.674]  Because this is what drives our governments and our economies.
[03:40:57.094 --> 03:41:09.820]  What we see happening globally is this shift of so much of productive capacity, capital, capital equipment, things that make things has been moved to China and to the third world.
[03:41:10.450 --> 03:41:33.377]  That's real wealth been moved to the third world and being combined with entrepreneurship and labor again an advantage of the third world with commodities coming out of the first world the developed world and the third world to feed that chain because everything's being pushed out of the west east and those in the east that have power the russian the chinese are recognizing the the whole
[03:41:34.859 --> 03:41:43.066]  Silken Road, the whole initiatives of China, the cooperation of China and Russia is about building a balance of hemispheres, okay?
[03:41:43.766 --> 03:41:55.396]  Because that's what's always taken place and really behind that is a balance of economic interest and globalists, who like to know there's always a competing power that can collect.
[03:41:55.756 --> 03:42:01.021]  You know, one of the early books on this was a book called None Dare Call a Conspiracy, written during the Carter administration.
[03:42:01.673 --> 03:42:15.366]  I would recommend, young viewers especially, and listeners, go back and look up the book, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, because it really lays out a pattern and a framework of globalists that still exist today.
[03:42:15.786 --> 03:42:19.850]  And this is going back, I mean, decades back in time.
[03:42:20.430 --> 03:42:21.391]  It's been updated.
[03:42:21.451 --> 03:42:22.692]  I'm looking at it right now.
[03:42:23.593 --> 03:42:23.913]  Larry,
[03:42:24.774 --> 03:42:30.295]  Abram was an author, but Gary Allen was a guy who got famous for this piece of work, and it is.
[03:42:30.415 --> 03:42:31.536]  It's well worth reading again.
[03:42:31.556 --> 03:42:44.739]  I encourage people to get that, look at it, and then lay it up against the current backdrop of what's going on, and also read 1984, you know, the fiction, and see the fact in what's playing out in our world today.
[03:42:45.379 --> 03:42:49.500]  This network is one of the few voices remaining that needs
[03:42:50.160 --> 03:42:58.695]  To be supported, that needs to stay in the air so we can continue to bring you the kind of information that you've been getting this last couple of weeks, particularly at this point in history.
[03:42:58.815 --> 03:43:00.378]  This is Nick Begich, we'll be right back.
[03:43:02.619 --> 03:43:11.486]  Globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[03:43:11.946 --> 03:43:19.893]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels
[03:43:20.353 --> 03:43:25.940]  Or oligopolies, groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[03:43:26.420 --> 03:43:29.444]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[03:43:29.864 --> 03:43:39.815]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[03:43:40.416 --> 03:43:44.058]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[03:43:44.498 --> 03:44:05.451]  And that's why the globalists, who were arrogant, are now panicking and trying to censor InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and my syndicated radio show because they know we've got our finger on the pulse of what's happening and that the President and the Pentagon and others are listening and know that we're telling the truth and we've basically become the modern Paul Revere transmission of this Republic.
[03:44:05.931 --> 03:44:21.263]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching or listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you, by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated, and this restoration of the Republic could be defeated.
[03:44:21.664 --> 03:44:26.548]  So please keep spreading the word, and whatever you do, remember, we're only financed now by you.
[03:44:27.088 --> 03:44:27.908]  We're in your hands.

[03:45:03.522 --> 03:45:12.431]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:45:12.591 --> 03:45:21.420]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:45:21.600 --> 03:45:22.301]  It's ridiculous.
[03:45:22.421 --> 03:45:23.962]  The CoQ10 PPQ.
[03:45:24.122 --> 03:45:27.385]  We have the organically derived, and by that it's not synthetic.
[03:45:27.625 --> 03:45:33.049]  Most of the stuff you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[03:45:33.129 --> 03:45:35.231]  This is the organically derived.
[03:45:35.651 --> 03:45:36.572]  This is the real stuff.
[03:45:36.752 --> 03:45:48.200]  I want to warn you though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[03:45:48.220 --> 03:45:49.902]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:45:50.582 --> 03:45:51.362]  Then tore it off.
[03:45:51.602 --> 03:45:53.043]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:45:53.183 --> 03:45:55.344]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:45:55.544 --> 03:45:57.084]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:45:57.144 --> 03:45:58.625]  First it tangled and it came back.
[03:45:58.825 --> 03:45:59.905]  I was like, this is incredible.
[03:45:59.965 --> 03:46:00.785]  But I'm going to warn you.
[03:46:00.985 --> 03:46:05.527]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:46:05.687 --> 03:46:09.468]  This is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[03:46:09.648 --> 03:46:11.969]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[03:46:12.209 --> 03:46:13.989]  So it's the building blocks.
[03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:15.170]  And it's the next level.
[03:46:15.230 --> 03:46:16.150]  It's the best you're going to get.
[03:46:16.290 --> 03:46:19.051]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[03:46:19.091 --> 03:46:19.871]  We're getting into supplements.
[03:46:20.111 --> 03:46:21.933]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[03:46:22.094 --> 03:46:27.280]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:46:27.420 --> 03:46:32.025]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[03:46:32.346 --> 03:46:33.968]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[03:46:35.289 --> 03:46:39.473]  Make it up 150%, then we discount it 20-30% down to $119.
[03:46:39.693 --> 03:46:43.256]  They're still, again, most of the cost is the product.
[03:46:43.356 --> 03:46:44.337]  It's 20% off.
[03:46:44.477 --> 03:46:46.078]  Profitably make funds this operation.
[03:46:46.779 --> 03:46:49.201]  97% reviews.
[03:46:49.221 --> 03:46:50.402]  4.7 power reviews, third party.
[03:46:50.522 --> 03:46:52.404]  Please, go read the reviews for yourself.
[03:46:52.684 --> 03:46:53.785]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:46:53.865 --> 03:46:55.066]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:46:55.166 --> 03:46:57.007]  It costs a lot because it's worth a lot.
[03:46:57.128 --> 03:46:57.868]  It's next level.
[03:46:57.968 --> 03:46:59.289]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:46:59.570 --> 03:47:01.171]  Fueling the human revolution.
[03:47:06.215 --> 03:47:08.937]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.908 --> 03:47:25.609]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.030 --> 03:47:27.531]  Because there is a war on.
[03:47:27.951 --> 03:47:28.912]  For your mind.
[03:47:29.572 --> 03:47:31.494]  With Nick Begich.
[03:47:36.696 --> 03:47:41.621]  Welcome back to this last segment of Friday, April 26, 2019.
[03:47:41.681 --> 03:47:46.326]  This is Dr. Nick Begich sitting in for Alex.
[03:47:46.386 --> 03:47:57.236]  And you know, we've been talking about a couple of things, kind of a little bit about the media and sort of how that's gone and how it's really gone bad is what we got to say.
[03:47:58.729 --> 03:48:03.332]  But really the combination of it becoming the propaganda tool for government.
[03:48:03.352 --> 03:48:08.555]  In fact, there was even appropriations made within the government's budget for propaganda.
[03:48:09.252 --> 03:48:10.132]  You know, what is that?
[03:48:10.232 --> 03:48:11.353]  That's about messaging.
[03:48:11.393 --> 03:48:14.414]  That's about pushing the public into certain opinions.
[03:48:14.854 --> 03:48:17.315]  I don't think this is the role of government, quite frankly.
[03:48:17.375 --> 03:48:19.036]  I think this is not the role of government.
[03:48:19.216 --> 03:48:25.278]  The role of government is to reflect our views and world views within our government, not the other way around.
[03:48:25.699 --> 03:48:28.900]  Not to establish ideas and then shove them down the public's throat.
[03:48:29.560 --> 03:48:34.982]  This is not the way our government was designed, not the way it was originally intended to operate at all.
[03:48:35.062 --> 03:48:36.583]  It was really the opposite.
[03:48:37.063 --> 03:48:48.711]  You know, in the last couple of weeks I've been sort of rereading Paine, I've been reading the Federalist Papers, rereading some of those basic documents that brought about the Republican.
[03:48:48.731 --> 03:48:50.392]  You know what's really striking?
[03:48:50.412 --> 03:48:54.175]  It's exactly the same parallels.
[03:48:54.753 --> 03:49:01.579]  You know, it's like the nobility is now replaced by corporate entities, but the families behind these tends to be the same.
[03:49:01.599 --> 03:49:09.646]  You know, how religion is used to manipulate people in one way or another, not just in the United States, but around the world.
[03:49:09.766 --> 03:49:20.676]  Various religious organizations are used to sort of suppress the population in certain ways, while the crown, so to speak, the globalists, loot the population in another way.
[03:49:21.397 --> 03:49:31.711]  And when you look at sort of how all this plays off of us, this is robbing us of our human dignity and what we really are as divinely created human beings.
[03:49:31.891 --> 03:49:36.438]  And I've said this often in my broadcast lately, you know, reminding
[03:49:37.236 --> 03:49:41.279]  ourselves of what we are as we jump into the game of life.
[03:49:41.379 --> 03:49:52.768]  You know, this is a short, very short stop on the planet that we get to do here and engage in this reality here as preachers created the image and likeness of God.
[03:49:52.808 --> 03:50:04.417]  We should begin reflecting that much differently in our discourse and much differently in the way we present, the way we attack, and the way we deliver the changes that each of us are affecting in our communities.
[03:50:04.437 --> 03:50:05.838]  You know, every single listener
[03:50:06.458 --> 03:50:17.504]  Every single person viewing these broadcasts is able to jump into this fight, and not in a combative, vicious sort of way, but with information.
[03:50:17.704 --> 03:50:19.185]  Pass information on.
[03:50:19.886 --> 03:50:21.346]  Duplicate what you see.
[03:50:21.627 --> 03:50:23.368]  Connect people up to good data.
[03:50:23.808 --> 03:50:25.489]  And let them make up their own minds.
[03:50:25.529 --> 03:50:27.110]  Hopefully they'll at least look at it.
[03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:29.391]  And you don't have to push quite so hard.
[03:50:30.257 --> 03:50:32.879]  And I think that's again, we get it really excited.
[03:50:33.579 --> 03:50:34.720]  And I do it too.
[03:50:34.940 --> 03:50:37.262]  And then we jump into this thing.
[03:50:37.562 --> 03:50:40.944]  And that's critical of all this.
[03:50:40.964 --> 03:50:42.285]  We got to keep that energy up.
[03:50:42.585 --> 03:50:48.829]  And what I know is, it's easy to get dissuaded, to get disillusioned by what you see in the world.
[03:50:49.249 --> 03:50:56.034]  But what I know from my own experience, is that as the temperature rises, and you see greater and greater conflict,
[03:50:56.494 --> 03:51:12.599]  The other is also present the opportunity for real solutions and those will come not from the top down but from the bottom up and that's what we're beginning to see more and more of people activating within our communities and doing something and saying something instead of just standing around.
[03:51:13.079 --> 03:51:23.062]  You know that that slogan that drives me nuts in airports you know see something say something which is creating that sort of the thing that used to happen in Russia where everybody was spying on everybody.
[03:51:24.077 --> 03:51:31.580]  But let's turn that around and say about the public, let's learn something, inform someone.
[03:51:31.620 --> 03:51:32.361]  How about that?
[03:51:32.981 --> 03:51:35.482]  Learn something new, inform someone else.
[03:51:35.602 --> 03:51:37.943]  Make that our saying instead of this.
[03:51:38.937 --> 03:51:41.759]  Let's spy on our neighbors and pass it on to the government.
[03:51:42.219 --> 03:51:45.141]  You know, how about let's see what the world is doing.
[03:51:45.181 --> 03:51:47.903]  Let's see what our government is doing and pass that on to our neighbors.
[03:51:48.383 --> 03:51:51.565]  A much better formula and one that can make a difference in the world.
[03:51:51.605 --> 03:51:55.247]  And we've seen it every time that anything has changed on the planet Earth.
[03:51:55.768 --> 03:51:59.430]  You know, when you think of revolutions as such in terms of thinking,
[03:52:00.225 --> 03:52:12.252]  Whether it's in art, science, business, politics, wherever human beings interact where there's real change, it usually started with one or two people seeing it a little bit differently and then articulating that.
[03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:17.231]  And that's what the alternative media has been about and is about.
[03:52:17.451 --> 03:52:30.213]  And what the idea of contrarian views has always been about is to elevate the debate to a point where we formulate solutions that can work in the current frame.
[03:52:30.473 --> 03:52:41.935]  Not that worked so much in the past or what we think might work in the future, but address those basic things in the present and address them on the platform of ideals and values that should not go away.
[03:52:42.535 --> 03:52:48.359]  That are embedded in our divinity and our humanity and what we are created to be and do on the planet.
[03:52:49.219 --> 03:52:58.605]  When I think about what's happening in the shift of economies, you know, there's another report in the last day on gold acquisitions in Russia.
[03:52:58.625 --> 03:53:03.548]  Do you know that the Russians have dropped their U.S.
[03:53:03.609 --> 03:53:05.710]  Treasury reserves by almost half?
[03:53:06.410 --> 03:53:07.230]  We're good to go.
[03:53:31.719 --> 03:53:58.605]  You know, and what they're doing is they're getting away from the dollar, because as you may not know, and you may know, the Eastern and Pacific Bank, you know, they got a whole new bank to compete with the International Monetary Fund and other Western-controlled banking systems, and they're replacing it with something different to build their infrastructure, to finance their debt, and to create a different kind of economy that's not dollar-based.
[03:53:59.145 --> 03:54:01.406]  This is a big thing happening right now.
[03:54:01.466 --> 03:54:03.166]  What's going on in Saudi Arabia?
[03:54:03.206 --> 03:54:08.068]  Why we're still cooperating so highly with them is because they're sucking up a lot of those dollars.
[03:54:08.528 --> 03:54:27.934]  Somebody has to do it because the Chinese are dumping their dollars, the Russians are dumping their dollars, the BRIC is consolidating their wealth and their commodities-based wealth, real wealth, gold, silver, copper, zinc, molybdenum, iron ore, on and on and on.
[03:54:28.945 --> 03:54:30.166]  This is what's happening.
[03:54:30.807 --> 03:54:34.230]  The productive wealth of the world is being shifted.
[03:54:34.351 --> 03:54:41.578]  Those four factors, the things that run between those four factors of production is currency, is money, is fiat.
[03:54:42.310 --> 03:54:52.015]  What those four things that represent real value, what you spend your money on is entrepreneurship, labor, natural resources and physical plant, things that build things.
[03:54:52.335 --> 03:54:56.176]  The four economic factors of production, the things that build real wealth.
[03:54:56.597 --> 03:55:00.338]  The wealth of a nation is embedded in these factors.
[03:55:00.739 --> 03:55:03.560]  We are debasing the productive factor.
[03:55:03.580 --> 03:55:09.563]  The biggest is the factories, the thing that kept us ahead of the game since the American Revolution.
[03:55:09.643 --> 03:55:10.303]  Think about it.
[03:55:10.763 --> 03:55:18.092]  We began to operate cotton mills and factories that began to compete with the Europeans.
[03:55:18.112 --> 03:55:25.620]  They then slapped us with tariffs and things that restricted trade and stamp access.
[03:55:25.700 --> 03:55:27.001]  That's where the war began.
[03:55:27.081 --> 03:55:41.049]  It was over unfair taxation and then what was warned about during the beginning of the revolution is they will use these wars to whip up the public and increase taxes to pay for the wars and then the taxes will never go away.
[03:55:41.970 --> 03:55:48.034]  That's what that's what Paine was saying 250 years ago and it's still happening today.
[03:55:48.514 --> 03:55:50.535]  I've talked about it in previous segments.
[03:55:50.575 --> 03:55:52.937]  You know what's ripping the hole out of the dollar?
[03:55:53.610 --> 03:55:54.450]  Yes, we are.
[03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:13.861]  Productive resources in these countries.
[03:56:14.261 --> 03:56:15.762]  The final blow will happen.
[03:56:16.302 --> 03:56:24.926]  It's going to be this administration and the next one that first save the foundations of the nation that allow us to be the leader the light in the world.
[03:56:25.406 --> 03:56:26.507]  And then secondly
[03:56:27.122 --> 03:56:30.285]  To reevaluate our global position in the world.
[03:56:30.365 --> 03:56:31.886]  Let's not go backwards.
[03:56:32.387 --> 03:56:34.108]  We are taking the right steps forward.
[03:56:34.168 --> 03:56:37.591]  Yes, we have a bully in the White House and we needed one.
[03:56:38.072 --> 03:56:39.573]  We needed one for a change.
[03:56:39.873 --> 03:56:44.237]  We needed someone that would push back for you and for me and quit.
[03:56:45.035 --> 03:56:49.038]  Bending over, running backwards, leading from behind.
[03:56:49.158 --> 03:56:51.660]  What a weird concept, the Obama concept.
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:54.982]  Let's get behind and lead from the back of the parade.
[03:56:55.382 --> 03:56:56.663]  What are you, kidding me?
[03:56:57.283 --> 03:57:03.788]  Let's reclaim, let's make America great again by making it recognized as a true voice for freedom.
[03:57:04.328 --> 03:57:10.172]  Not the dictator that comes into your country and does regime change as a way to interfere with your elections.
[03:57:10.772 --> 03:57:25.221]  But comes back to our base and recognizes that the engagement of foreign wars generally don't work in our favor, particularly when most of those conflicts fuel the military and industrial complex that has been working against the American public.
[03:57:25.761 --> 03:57:27.002]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:57:27.062 --> 03:57:29.283]  Support this network and do it right now.
[03:57:29.623 --> 03:57:30.804]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:57:30.824 --> 03:57:32.405]  You've been listening to InfoWars.
[03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:37.295]  wars.com and I'm stepping in and sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:57:37.655 --> 03:57:41.619]  The most important voice in the world today is InfoWAR.
[03:57:41.739 --> 03:57:47.786]  Pass it on to your friends, let others know what we're doing here and let's change the very complexion of the nation and the world.
[03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:54.271]  Well, here's what Biden is up against.
[03:57:54.631 --> 03:57:56.532]  Here's how it may keep coming back and back and back.
[03:57:56.852 --> 03:58:01.974]  This is a meme that was created by a semi-anonymous man from Kansas City, from Kansas.
[03:58:02.314 --> 03:58:06.796]  He posted it, and then the Trump world posted it, and then the president himself posted it on Twitter.
[03:58:06.816 --> 03:58:08.317]  It's Biden fondling himself.
[03:58:08.617 --> 03:58:09.938]  Now, on one level, it's just a funny meme.
[03:58:10.658 --> 03:58:13.581]  On another level, this is how politics is waged as a state.
[03:58:13.641 --> 03:58:15.063]  These are the meme wars in action.
[03:58:15.483 --> 03:58:17.565]  Do you think Democrats understand what they're up against?
[03:58:17.585 --> 03:58:26.515]  Because there was a Mother Jones headline the other day saying the right-wing media machine is much more effective at this kind of visual communication, and the Democrats aren't even trying.
[03:58:43.224 --> 03:58:44.465]  I can't breathe in this thing!
[03:58:44.665 --> 03:58:45.026]  Speed!
[03:58:45.126 --> 03:58:46.607]  Ludicrous speed!
[03:58:46.767 --> 03:58:47.087]  Go!
