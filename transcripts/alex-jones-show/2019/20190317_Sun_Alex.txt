[00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:08.729]  I'm good.
[00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.838]  It's Sunday, March 17th, 2019.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.443]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:55.711]  We have some really serious, big breaking news, exclusive news here.
[00:00:56.892 --> 00:01:02.458]  Dealing with a hardcore child rapist convicted illegally
[00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:12.559]  Frolicking with children as young as two under state-sponsored operations in Houston, the blue city of Cess.
[00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:19.668]  Houston now known as Sodom and Gomorrah of South Texas.
[00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.331]  Oh yeah, it's like San Francisco.
[00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:25.682]  And we actually have the left people defending this.
[00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:29.843]  Oh, sex offenders, they're people too, like the New York Times says.
[00:01:30.343 --> 00:01:39.605]  Let them dress up in clown outfits and touch your children and tell them to do sexual simulations.
[00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:52.487]  Oh, turns out we have the video of this man leading the children in simulated sex acts with other literal goblin creatures.
[00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:55.982]  So radio listeners, I'll be breaking it down.
[00:01:56.042 --> 00:02:00.083]  TV viewers, you're going to have to face what the children face.
[00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:07.825]  But the good news is, our calls to go to these events and run people's plates are paying off.
[00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:12.006]  Oh, and there'll be more breaking news very soon from New York.
[00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:17.108]  We've just got some lawyers involved right now, and then law enforcement involved.
[00:02:18.308 --> 00:02:19.228]  But let's just say this.
[00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.168]  We have audio.
[00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:21.869]  We have video.
[00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:29.954]  I don't want to be like Darth Vader where he's got Luke Skywalker in Episode 4 in the crosshairs and he goes, I have you now.
[00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:31.735]  We don't want to do that.
[00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:34.278]  We don't want to say I have you till the X-Wing.
[00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:42.686]  I don't want to compare these guys to Luke Skywalker where you get the allegory and he goes... And then we'll tell you I have you.
[00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:44.048]  Show!
[00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:46.675]  We're very busy.
[00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:48.336]  We're busy beavers.
[00:02:48.836 --> 00:03:04.566]  And as I told you, we're not going to put up with the national media saying pedophilia doesn't exist, and then defend it and try to send in their commandos, because this guy is their commando, in his clown outfit, into your children, convicted of raping an eight-year-old boy.
[00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:11.391]  But yes, I don't want to give away the whole farm here, but we've been involved in all this.
[00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.753]  I mean, I told you a few months ago on air, I said, we're financing
[00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:17.021]  Investigating these people.
[00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:21.102]  And the best place to catch a predator is at their feeding grounds.
[00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:33.625]  If you want to hunt one of these creatures, legally and lawfully, you have to go to their watering holes.
[00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:38.066]  In the old days, they had to grab kids out of their backyards or playgrounds.
[00:03:38.926 --> 00:03:41.347]  Now the parents bring their children to them.
[00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:48.258]  And it's not men, it's women in clown outfits.
[00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.700]  Ah, and they talk to the two and three year olds about their booties.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.702]  Let's have the child rapist talk about your son and daughter's booty.
[00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:04.404]  And let's have them dress up and come to the gay bar and dance.
[00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:08.906]  So, it's all breaking now.
[00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:16.288]  And again, while I'm on a cheesy Darth Vader riff, stay in attack formation.
[00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.010]  So, when I come back, we're going to get into that.
[00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:23.952]  I don't want to say I let you down.
[00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:31.217]  Actually, I really feel like we've arrived in that the public thinks for themselves now.
[00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:35.399]  And our mission, your mission, to a great extent, has been completed.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.660]  We have other missions, obviously.
[00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.732]  Everyone, including the shooter, says it's a false flag.
[00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:44.073]  I've never said that.
[00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:49.515]  So I was kind of objectively looking at it on Friday, while it was hiding in plain view.
[00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:50.556]  We have a bunch of big developments there.
[00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:56.959]  But then, I was reading his manifesto again this morning, and I went, wait a minute, he says it's a false flag.
[00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:58.219]  He says that.
[00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:59.380]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.720]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:07.490]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.093]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:05:12.493 --> 00:05:19.538]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:22.660]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.043]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:31.338]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:33.059]  We are the power structure.
[00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:34.600]  We are the inventors.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.221]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:05:36.942 --> 00:05:39.744]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:46.289]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.253]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:05:52.288 --> 00:06:02.816]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at Forrestore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:08.420]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.144]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:18.908]  Sunday, March 12, 2019.
[00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:50.452]  All right, let me lay out we're gonna be breaking down here today I have done a deep dive as they say on the tragic 50 dead Many others wounded at the mosque in Christ Church on March 15th the Ides of March and the
[00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:55.647]  Findings are conclusive and shocking.
[00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.848]  We're going to cover that first.
[00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:05.612]  Then, I don't want to give away our game plan, but it just metaphysically, I feel like I always have to.
[00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:14.738]  Because these pedos can't help themselves, but I still have to warn them, because I don't want to entrap them, even though I'm not bringing the kids to them.
[00:07:15.178 --> 00:07:17.099]  Still, I want them to know we're watching.
[00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.501]  If law enforcement's controlled or being blocked, we're not.
[00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:29.971]  And we're legally and lawfully going to be investigating all of these drag queen festivals that are in public spaces.
[00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:36.655]  Whether they're in public schools, whether they're in libraries, whether they're in hotels, we're going to be watching you.
[00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:38.596]  In fact, I've made a full commitment.
[00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:41.838]  We've already done some funding on this in the last year.
[00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:45.601]  You're seeing that pay off in Houston.
[00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:58.716]  Uh, with a hardcore child rapist who was leading operations against children as young as two, with the knowing accomplices in the government of Houston, which is now a pedo command base.
[00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:01.919]  And I have that from the U.S.
[00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:03.821]  Army, federal law enforcement, you name it.
[00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:05.463]  Very dangerous city now.
[00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:06.744]  Very evil.
[00:08:07.384 --> 00:08:10.608]  Doesn't mean all the police are bad, but it's in trouble.
[00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:21.312]  Like New York, like San Francisco, it is now free reign for hardcore child rapists, like you see on screen of your TV viewer.
[00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.933]  That is coming up after I get into the false flag news.
[00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:29.575]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:39.378]  I'm not saying this is a false flag in the term the media is going to use.
[00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:43.460]  Because they have limited understanding of the definition of false flag.
[00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:58.725]  I have put into modern use and parlance the modern definition of the historical research of in the past and in the present what false flag variants are.
[00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:01.749]  So there's a spectrum.
[00:09:04.872 --> 00:09:06.054]  But everybody knows that
[00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:16.228]  Jussie Smollett was a classical full-spectrum false flag where from pillar to post the whole thing was staged.
[00:09:19.002 --> 00:09:20.823]  But there's different types of false flags.
[00:09:20.983 --> 00:09:29.629]  And I don't want to say I'm ashamed of myself, but as I've gotten older, I've been a little bit more timid and don't go with my initial instincts or analysis just to be safe.
[00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:30.830]  And I think that's a good thing.
[00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.012]  I'm not 22 years old on air, you know.
[00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:38.035]  I was already a big history buff at that point, but still was full of piss and vinegar.
[00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:38.816]  I'm a little more careful.
[00:09:40.257 --> 00:09:41.177]  And everybody should be.
[00:09:41.517 --> 00:09:42.058]  But since
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:57.833]  The shooter himself, in his manifesto, says that he's doing all this to cause a global civil war and race war, and doing it to make people fight each other, and he says he's leftist, but he's also this and that.
[00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:06.321]  He's saying he's doing it to blame different parties that actually didn't do it.
[00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:15.091]  We're not saying he didn't do it, we're saying he has another motive than for why he's doing it and he tells you this in plain view.
[00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:19.132]  Which I've learned metaphysical vampires always do.
[00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:20.832]  I'm not saying he's a literal vampire.
[00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:32.295]  I've read his manifesto twice now and I'm kind of ashamed that I didn't say on Friday, hey this guy says it's a false flag.
[00:10:33.636 --> 00:10:34.896]  Now Rush Limbaugh did!
[00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:40.185]  And see, there's a certain satisfaction there now.
[00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:44.213]  That 15 years ago, Limbaugh wouldn't have said that.
[00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:52.481]  But in 2019, Limbaugh did because it's safe now to say what everybody already suspects.
[00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:55.202]  And again, it doesn't mean the government was involved.
[00:10:55.462 --> 00:10:57.082]  It doesn't mean that the guy didn't do it.
[00:10:57.462 --> 00:11:01.023]  He says in the manifesto, I'm trolling you.
[00:11:01.343 --> 00:11:05.484]  And he lists all these different ideologies, but then says, I want a big result.
[00:11:05.704 --> 00:11:06.625]  I want censorship.
[00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:07.825]  I want control.
[00:11:07.845 --> 00:11:11.466]  This would obviously help radical Islam expand.
[00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:15.027]  He tells you there what he's doing.
[00:11:16.997 --> 00:11:28.889]  See, if Jussie Smollett was really committed to evil, he would have killed himself and made it look like white supremacy.
[00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:36.376]  But instead, he went out like Laurel and Hardy or the Three Stooges and staged a ridiculously transparent event.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.241]  And the attacks on synagogues.
[00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:43.004]  I mean, almost all these events are staged.
[00:11:43.324 --> 00:11:44.665]  It comes out, they're staged.
[00:11:45.006 --> 00:11:47.428]  There aren't real people doing poop swastikas.
[00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:51.832]  There aren't real people at the Air Force Academy saying no N-words aloud.
[00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:53.994]  It just isn't going on.
[00:11:57.213 --> 00:11:59.474]  Maybe in some weird areas of East Texas.
[00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:01.955]  Maybe in some weird areas of Mississippi.
[00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:04.677]  And by the way, my dad's family's from East Texas.
[00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:05.337]  They're great people.
[00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:08.539]  It's a tiny minority there that's actually in the KKK.
[00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:09.819]  But they exist.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.341]  Just like you go to the wrong area, any place, there'll be a Mexican gang, a black gang.
[00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:17.083]  The KKK are rural, white gangs.
[00:12:19.383 --> 00:12:25.306]  And let me tell you, you pull up in a new truck and you got the super hot girl in town on your arm at Dairy Queen on Friday night.
[00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:27.247]  Four guys will walk over to you.
[00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:30.888]  If you're in the wrong place and say, we're in the KKK, you better get out of here.
[00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:32.209]  We're going to kick your ass.
[00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:33.830]  And I'm like, what you are is jealous.
[00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.411]  Let's go outside and I'll stomp your head in the ground.
[00:12:37.952 --> 00:12:38.572]  That's a true story.
[00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:40.213]  Of course, they backed off at that point.
[00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:46.716]  They're always the low IQ losers in town.
[00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:49.890]  They've usually got a chromosomal problem.
[00:12:50.151 --> 00:12:50.851]  It's sad.
[00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:51.953]  They're pathetic.
[00:12:52.674 --> 00:12:55.417]  They're not this giant, expanding power force.
[00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:58.601]  I tuned into CNN today to monitor it, and there was Brian Stelter.
[00:12:58.962 --> 00:13:03.107]  He was going, exploding white supremacist attacks, epidemics worldwide.
[00:13:03.327 --> 00:13:04.569]  They're incredibly rare.
[00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:16.337]  This event's carried out by a self-described eco-leftist who loves communist China, has a classic intelligence operative M.O., who doesn't work but travels the world all over the place.
[00:13:16.657 --> 00:13:18.459]  Looks like he has a commando build.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.481]  The whole thing stinks.
[00:13:23.163 --> 00:13:24.564]  But he's telling you!
[00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:34.311]  That he staged it to cause a race war and is manipulating people just like the leftist Charlie Manson tried in 1969.
[00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:35.992]  So I don't know all the answers.
[00:13:36.813 --> 00:13:40.795]  But when he says he's staging it to get people fighting, that's a false flag.
[00:13:41.036 --> 00:13:44.618]  A false flag is something you do to get people fighting or to blame someone.
[00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:47.100]  I'll explain it when we come back and give you the new developments.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.461]  I know most of you already understand this.
[00:13:51.403 --> 00:13:57.487]  And then, as you all know about two months ago, I have trouble not letting cats out of bags.
[00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:12.104]  I said, all you pedos better watch out at your little pedo induction events where people bring their children in to openly, in many cases, be auctioned off at the same hotel to be taken upstairs and buggered by pot-bellied pedos.
[00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:14.525]  I said, you better watch out.
[00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:21.129]  Because people are going to run your plates.
[00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:26.872]  And when it comes back, your child rapist, you're going to go to jail.
[00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:28.892]  And now it's starting to happen.
[00:14:28.932 --> 00:14:30.173]  We're not playing games.
[00:14:31.514 --> 00:14:33.316]  The money's on the street.
[00:14:34.837 --> 00:14:40.161]  And soon I'm going to announce, and I'm working with lawyers and others to make sure it's all done right, bounties.
[00:14:43.364 --> 00:14:52.612]  So we're going to turn loose the muscle, legally and lawfully on you, because we're not going to let a bunch of big, fat, degenerate men come in there and have their way with children.
[00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:54.861]  Everybody else can.
[00:14:55.441 --> 00:15:02.664]  All the other men can run around and act tough and drive around in their big trucks and cook their briskets and get tattoos and shoot their guns all day.
[00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:04.064]  I like doing that stuff too.
[00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:04.984]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:08.225]  But you really ought to be spending some time protecting children.
[00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:16.868]  Because it's a move in every town and every city to let them into the school and not even tell parents it's going on.
[00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:23.023]  You think I'm sitting up here going, man, I'm really great.
[00:15:23.103 --> 00:15:25.444]  I'm really good that I'm the only guy that'll actually do this.
[00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:28.184]  The only person that built an operation to fight these people.
[00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:30.605]  You think I feel good being the only person doing this?
[00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:32.225]  I feel like crap.
[00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:33.866]  Makes me sick!
[00:15:35.966 --> 00:15:37.646]  Where the hell are all the men in this country?
[00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.047]  You're a bunch of posers.
[00:15:43.948 --> 00:15:44.768]  A bunch of cowards.
[00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:46.628]  A bunch of little boys.
[00:15:47.688 --> 00:15:48.929]  You're not really fighting evil.
[00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:50.669]  You're pretending to be a man.
[00:15:52.691 --> 00:15:54.172]  I know our listeners are taking action.
[00:15:55.052 --> 00:15:58.414]  Funding this operation is spreading the word, so you stand right with us, and I salute you.
[00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:00.655]  But that's the bare minimum everybody should do!
[00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:19.085]  In previous revolutions, some good, some bad, the revolutionaries funded themselves by robbing stagecoaches full of gold, or robbing trains full of silver, or basically going through the countryside and pillaging.
[00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:24.555]  Well, we've been blessed the 21st century in this great free market system that we've got.
[00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:33.688]  To be able to just use the free market and high quality products and the rules of commerce to go out and get great products.
[00:16:35.126 --> 00:16:42.292]  That people get great results from and then discount those products to you so that it becomes the total 360 win.
[00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:48.377]  And I obsess over that term that I coined years ago because that's really what I believe in.
[00:16:48.457 --> 00:16:52.921]  It's a non-zero-sum game where everybody basically benefits.
[00:16:53.281 --> 00:16:58.245]  It's beyond just symbiotic where everybody kind of works with each other and everybody makes it.
[00:16:58.525 --> 00:17:01.007]  This is where we have an even better future together.
[00:17:02.248 --> 00:17:03.490]  And so we're not robbing banks here.
[00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:07.346]  We're not engaged in criminal activity to fund our operations.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.761]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaged in good old-fashioned free market.
[00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:15.302]  It doesn't mean the whole world's free market, it doesn't mean America's perfect free market.
[00:17:15.923 --> 00:17:22.665]  We have socialism, we have communist tendencies, we have these parasitic systems nesting inside the free market capitalist system.
[00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:33.849]  But Infowars itself is a pretty much pure form of Americana free market capitalism, and your participation in it is a beautiful part of that.
[00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:35.530]  So, throughout the month,
[00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:46.177]  Of March, in the few weeks we have left, we're offering store-wide free shipping and 50% off all our best-selling supplements and a bunch of other huge specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:46.717 --> 00:17:49.239]  And again, InfoWarsStore.com is the main mothership site.
[00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.381]  InfoWarsLife.com will take you right to the supplement pages.
[00:17:52.741 --> 00:18:02.528]  Whether it's books, videos, non-gmo heirloom seeds, t-shirts, ball caps, whatever it is, it's high quality, it spreads the word, and it funds the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:04.470]  I've got some really good news, though.
[00:18:05.598 --> 00:18:06.259]  X2's back.
[00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:08.221]  The original X2.
[00:18:08.741 --> 00:18:11.524]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[00:18:11.644 --> 00:18:12.325]  What you want.
[00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.806]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:13.846 --> 00:18:14.807]  It'll be here in a week.
[00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:16.408]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:17.790]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.171]  With the best iodine in the world.
[00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:20.352]  X2, it's available.
[00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:21.713]  I thought X3's great.
[00:18:21.753 --> 00:18:23.555]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:25.737]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[00:18:25.777 --> 00:18:26.678]  The scientists that do that.
[00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:28.920]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.843]  Well, I was resigned to the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[00:18:34.123 --> 00:18:37.664]  We now have X2 again, and in fullmorestore.com, so hallelujah!
[00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:49.889]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:58.512]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[00:19:03.007 --> 00:19:07.971]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:15.756]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:19:16.777 --> 00:19:19.338]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:21.099]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:27.784]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:19:29.865 --> 00:19:38.093]  The Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology, and we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:41.736]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:19:41.756 --> 00:19:45.640]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.742]  I've got two in my home.
[00:19:47.882 --> 00:19:53.487]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:19:53.968 --> 00:19:54.828]  Don't live
[00:19:55.629 --> 00:19:59.334]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:19:59.354 --> 00:20:01.596]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:06.482 --> 00:20:09.126]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:35.623 --> 00:20:36.784]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:37.784 --> 00:20:40.586]  I'm live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.226]  to 3 p.m.
[00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:49.710]  Central right here at Infowars.com and Newswars.com and on radio stations across the country and quite a few TV and cable stations as well.
[00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.591]  I want to thank all of those affiliates, however you're listening to those.
[00:20:52.952 --> 00:21:00.055]  Please tell everyone you know about them because that's how we get through the censors is you.
[00:21:00.495 --> 00:21:01.576]  You are the resistance.
[00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.157]  You are the Infowar.
[00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:07.739]  The globalists are the resistance to nation states and prosperity and the family.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.821]  We are the resistance to their tyranny.
[00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:11.282]  And we are the cure.
[00:21:13.124 --> 00:21:16.226]  So, I don't want to say I'm ashamed at being scooped.
[00:21:17.408 --> 00:21:18.408]  Because I'm not.
[00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:31.780]  If you listen to the totality, the compendium of what I said in four hours during the Friday broadcast on the Ides of March, a date I predicted there'd be a terror attack on record.
[00:21:34.707 --> 00:21:36.188]  That's when Roman armies went to war.
[00:21:37.449 --> 00:21:38.750]  March is named after Mars.
[00:21:39.291 --> 00:21:41.332]  It's seen as a bad omen for tyrants.
[00:21:42.453 --> 00:21:43.694]  Julius Caesar was killed then.
[00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:47.778]  And, of course, this guy wanted to send his political message then.
[00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:52.581]  Another big date you see terror attacks on, another big event, is May 1st.
[00:21:53.482 --> 00:22:01.649]  The Communist holiday formerly, previous to that, its fount, its headwaters, came out of the occult.
[00:22:04.113 --> 00:22:07.855]  So I'd look for something on that date as well, but let's just continue to expand here.
[00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:17.940]  I came out and I said, I don't know if this is a false flag, but I don't know how he got these illegal guns when he's from Australia and they have very serious gun control in New Zealand.
[00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:24.803]  And I said, if you read his manifesto, he says, I'm not really telling you who I am.
[00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:26.164]  I like communism.
[00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:27.105]  I don't like Christians.
[00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.085]  I don't like conservatives.
[00:22:29.846 --> 00:22:31.267]  He's been to all these Muslim countries.
[00:22:31.307 --> 00:22:32.187]  He doesn't seem to work.
[00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:33.768]  He has an intelligence agent cutout.
[00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:38.768]  And he says he wants to cause a global civil war.
[00:22:38.808 --> 00:22:47.456]  Well, that's the definition of a false flag, is when you stage something to blame someone else or to get a desired political outcome.
[00:22:50.038 --> 00:22:51.759]  So I'm going to break this down here in a moment.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.665]  But first, I got two calls by big national media figures this weekend.
[00:22:57.685 --> 00:23:00.467]  I mean, about as big as you could get.
[00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:01.888]  You could argue which one is bigger.
[00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:03.731]  They're right up there.
[00:23:04.171 --> 00:23:08.733]  You could argue that either one of these people is the biggest mainstream media in the country.
[00:23:10.393 --> 00:23:11.353]  So I got contacted.
[00:23:11.573 --> 00:23:13.434]  Well, one person text messaged me and I called them.
[00:23:13.454 --> 00:23:14.654]  The other person called me.
[00:23:14.954 --> 00:23:16.415]  So technically, I called one of them.
[00:23:18.015 --> 00:23:21.096]  And one of them said, are you really saying this is a false flag?
[00:23:21.116 --> 00:23:22.356]  Because there's this article saying it.
[00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:24.797]  And I called him and I said, no, not yet.
[00:23:27.998 --> 00:23:34.859]  But then I went through and explained how weird it was and how the guy probably just wanted attention, but was playing different groups off against each other.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.240]  The other person called me and they said, why aren't you saying it's a false flag?
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.341]  You're Mr. False Flag.
[00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:41.941]  Is it because you're getting sued from Sandy Hook?
[00:23:41.961 --> 00:23:42.661]  And I said, no.
[00:23:42.681 --> 00:23:45.362]  If I thought it was 100% false flag, I'd say it.
[00:23:45.822 --> 00:23:46.742]  I can't prove that.
[00:23:48.002 --> 00:23:50.003]  Then I got up this morning.
[00:23:50.043 --> 00:23:52.583]  I hadn't noticed it was on InfoWars.com for already a day and a half.
[00:23:53.003 --> 00:23:56.884]  Rush Limbaugh came out and said, we have to look at this as a possible false flag.
[00:23:59.244 --> 00:24:12.467]  Because the guy says he's a leftist, the guy says he's an eco-fascist, the guy says there's too many people, and he says he wants to cause a helter-skelter race war globally, which is what leftist Charlie Manson wanted.
[00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:15.568]  Now again, I was saying all that on Friday.
[00:24:15.628 --> 00:24:17.228]  I was saying, this could be.
[00:24:17.348 --> 00:24:22.250]  He fits the classic eco-terrorist that wants to cause a global race war to reduce population.
[00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.830]  They're the ones saying there's too many people.
[00:24:26.072 --> 00:24:33.997]  But even Limbaugh, it's like a 10 minute piece, it's up on Infowars.com, it's going to play a minute or so of it, is ahead of me saying it's a false flag.
[00:24:34.517 --> 00:24:36.238]  Our listeners think it's a staged event.
[00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:41.241]  So I want to get into the latest developments on this tragic event that killed 50 people.
[00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:47.108]  And then when we come back, I'm going to get into the history of false flags briefly, and the different variants of them.
[00:24:47.788 --> 00:24:53.671]  So that when you hear me say it has false flag attributes, it doesn't mean this guy isn't the shooter.
[00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:55.311]  It doesn't mean people didn't die.
[00:24:56.372 --> 00:24:59.793]  It means he had a goal other than what the media is telling you.
[00:25:00.053 --> 00:25:03.975]  He had a goal to blame someone else that was his political enemy.
[00:25:04.175 --> 00:25:04.935]  And who's being blamed?
[00:25:05.115 --> 00:25:05.635]  The right wing.
[00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:07.876]  The Nationalists.
[00:25:08.156 --> 00:25:09.677]  Anybody that doesn't want an Islamic invasion.
[00:25:11.021 --> 00:25:16.622]  And that's what Limbaugh's saying properly, because when you study history, let me just give you one before we go to break.
[00:25:18.463 --> 00:25:20.543]  You don't think Hitler just attacked Poland.
[00:25:21.263 --> 00:25:22.303]  He had to make up a reason.
[00:25:22.764 --> 00:25:25.064]  He launched Operation Himmler.
[00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:30.245]  What, in like early 1940?
[00:25:30.765 --> 00:25:35.086]  Let's pull up Operation Himmler, when Hitler attacked Poland.
[00:25:35.126 --> 00:25:36.867]  I forget the exact date, but it's declassified.
[00:25:37.167 --> 00:25:38.507]  They admitted it in Nuremberg, they did this.
[00:25:39.406 --> 00:25:42.828]  Even Wikipedia has Operation Hemler.
[00:25:43.048 --> 00:25:45.889]  1939 false flag project planned by Nazi Germany.
[00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.171]  Oh, but I thought false flags don't exist.
[00:25:50.191 --> 00:25:50.951]  CNN said so.
[00:25:51.972 --> 00:26:01.276]  So they launched the attack, attacking their own military bases, dressing up
[00:26:03.427 --> 00:26:16.376]  Prisoners, Polish prisoners that they'd already captured, as Polish military and German military shot them, shot newsreels of it, and then said Poland has attacked Germany and launched World War II.
[00:26:17.516 --> 00:26:27.723]  So World War II came out of a false flag, that's in Encyclopedia Britannica, it's on History Channel, it's on Discovery Channel, it was in the Nuremberg trials, it was adjudicated.
[00:26:31.646 --> 00:26:33.087]  Now there's the blonde beast right there.
[00:26:34.417 --> 00:26:34.817]  Heinrich.
[00:26:35.078 --> 00:26:36.759]  Planning the whole thing with Heinrich.
[00:26:36.999 --> 00:26:37.319]  Himmler.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.421]  Your TV viewer.
[00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:42.544]  The average person would say, who are those people?
[00:26:42.564 --> 00:26:44.405]  See, I know who all four of those Nazis are.
[00:26:44.765 --> 00:26:45.926]  Because I've studied it.
[00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:48.088]  That one right there on the corner, Zeb Dietrich.
[00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:52.652]  So, this is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:57.776 --> 00:27:00.478]  Hitler became a dictator by blowing up the Capitol building.
[00:27:00.818 --> 00:27:01.879]  The Reichstag fire.
[00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:02.640]  Learn about it.
[00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:06.678]  So it doesn't mean everything's a false flag, but there are a lot of them.
[00:27:07.399 --> 00:27:08.660]  And you better be aware of them.
[00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:13.184]  And the elite are all moving to New Zealand, and they want total gun control.
[00:27:13.224 --> 00:27:14.325]  That's their new capital.
[00:27:16.528 --> 00:27:19.591]  Underground bunkers, command bases, artillery.
[00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:21.432]  They don't want you having guns.
[00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:22.814]  So, who gets blamed?
[00:27:22.834 --> 00:27:23.394]  Conservatives.
[00:27:23.454 --> 00:27:23.975]  Nationalists.
[00:27:25.225 --> 00:27:29.729]  Every time Muslims kill a bunch of people, run over folks, shoot up a church, it gets almost no coverage.
[00:27:29.929 --> 00:27:33.933]  We're seeing their graves, the funerals, they're humanizing them, which is good!
[00:27:38.237 --> 00:27:40.519]  But they're not humanizing Christians when they get killed.
[00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:43.601]  You can see the political manipulation of this.
[00:27:44.222 --> 00:27:45.443]  Don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:46.424]  Here's Rush Limbaugh.
[00:27:47.748 --> 00:27:55.092]  You're gonna get shot in the process, and you can't immediately discount this.
[00:27:56.073 --> 00:28:09.741]  The left is this insane, they are this crazy, and if that's exactly what the guy's trying to do, then he's hit a home run because right there on Fox News, the shooter is an admitted white nationalist who hates immigrants.
[00:28:16.716 --> 00:28:21.359]  You try to absorb all of this, try to keep some kind of an even keel about it.
[00:28:21.379 --> 00:28:25.981]  Alright, we're going to come back with a full clip on the other side where he clearly says this is going to be a false flag.
[00:28:26.501 --> 00:28:28.302]  A leftist that wants to demonize conservatives.
[00:28:28.742 --> 00:28:29.803]  So he goes out and does this.
[00:28:29.923 --> 00:28:32.344]  Oh, like Jesse Smollett, but to the next level.
[00:28:32.364 --> 00:28:40.208]  See, the reason I don't know about false flags is I was into comic books and pulp fiction sort of reading when I was about four.
[00:28:40.749 --> 00:28:42.810]  And I was a really good reader by about seven or eight.
[00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:46.725]  And then I started reading military war books and it was over.
[00:28:47.506 --> 00:28:50.029]  So I'd read thousands by college.
[00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.411]  Maybe a thousand books.
[00:28:52.212 --> 00:28:59.541]  And so then I would go to college and hear this whole fake history, because I had like a PhD level education in history, and they would say, oh false flags don't exist.
[00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:00.803]  I'm like, the hell they don't.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.401]  Twitter censorship.
[00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:08.426]  The three strikes that took down Alex Jones.
[00:29:09.227 --> 00:29:09.807]  Strike one.
[00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:11.469]  Child abuse.
[00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:16.795]  There was a video that was uploaded that showed a child being violently thrown to the ground and crying.
[00:29:17.035 --> 00:29:21.600]  The video in question is a viral meme with over a hundred thousand retweets.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:28.101]  The meme showed a child bullying an adult who was eventually pushed to the ground and started crying like a victim.
[00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:34.902]  The reason this video went viral in 2018 was because it reflected the strategy of the new American left.
[00:29:35.402 --> 00:29:39.263]  Bully your opponents and then cry foul when they try to fight back.
[00:29:39.763 --> 00:29:51.085]  Forbes originally claimed that the man in the video was Alex Jones himself and somehow InfoWars is to blame for a video that remained on Twitter for months after the fact.
[00:29:51.305 --> 00:29:51.925]  Strike two.
[00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:55.248]  Inciting violence.
[00:29:55.348 --> 00:29:59.311]  The second one was a video that we viewed as incitement of violence.
[00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:03.194]  The original video was a message directed towards President Trump.
[00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:09.078]  This is an emergency message to President Trump, to Congress, and to anyone that supports free speech in this country.
[00:30:09.138 --> 00:30:10.199]  Twitter ignores this.
[00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:17.102]  They selected a short segment and deceitfully acted as if Alex Jones was inciting violence against the media.
[00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:20.144]  But now it's time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag.
[00:30:20.244 --> 00:30:25.846]  I know the Justice Department's crippled a bunch of followers and cowards, but there's groups, there's grand juries, there's... You call for it.
[00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:32.090]  It's time politically, economically, and judiciously, and legally, and criminally, to move against these people.
[00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.870]  It's got to be done now.
[00:30:34.011 --> 00:30:38.833]  Get together the people you know aren't traitors and aren't cowards and aren't hedging their frickin' bets like all these other a**holes.
[00:30:39.493 --> 00:30:40.593]  And let's go, let's do it.
[00:30:40.753 --> 00:30:42.194]  And then there's a bunch of other stuff.
[00:30:43.334 --> 00:30:49.975]  The other stuff that Twitter decided to ignore made it clear that the statement was being made to President Trump.
[00:30:50.375 --> 00:30:51.276]  Because they're coming.
[00:30:52.256 --> 00:30:55.076]  Now in your wisdom, you may be playing possum and waiting for them to come in.
[00:30:55.496 --> 00:31:00.037]  Alex Jones was encouraging the president to take action against internet censorship.
[00:31:00.757 --> 00:31:08.199]  And after omitting this fact, they skipped forward to Alex Jones reminding Americans of the importance of their Second Amendment rights.
[00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:11.302]  People need to have their battle rifles and everything ready, their bedsides.
[00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:12.243]  You gotta be ready.
[00:31:12.363 --> 00:31:14.685]  The media is so disciplined in their deception.
[00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:18.889]  Antifa attacked all these people at the White House, beat up reporters, beat up women and children.
[00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:19.830]  No coverage.
[00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.472]  Twitter does not respect the Second Amendment.
[00:31:23.013 --> 00:31:23.753]  Strike three!
[00:31:24.354 --> 00:31:26.036]  Bullying Oliver Darcy.
[00:31:26.954 --> 00:31:33.622]  So the third strike that we looked at was a verbal altercation that Alex got into with a journalist.
[00:31:33.863 --> 00:31:35.665]  You're a virus to America and freedom.
[00:31:35.805 --> 00:31:39.129]  Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:43.434]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff in my view.
[00:31:43.514 --> 00:31:44.155]  That's enough!
[00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:44.736]  Really?
[00:31:44.816 --> 00:31:45.557]  That's hilarious.
[00:31:45.697 --> 00:31:50.923]  The altercation with Oliver Darcy is the real reason why Alex Jones was deleted from Twitter.
[00:31:51.524 --> 00:32:02.136]  Rather than allowing an open and honest discussion, and possibly resolving our differences peacefully, they choose to silence their opposition and push towards a violent civil war.
[00:32:04.498 --> 00:32:15.486]  Jack himself encouraged everyone to read an article which basically outlined the fact that there's no civility left and that civil war is likely to happen in America.
[00:32:15.966 --> 00:32:22.671]  It says that the article was, why there's no bipartisan way forward at this juncture in our history, one side must win.
[00:32:22.991 --> 00:32:29.336]  If you exacerbate the divisions in society that's so rife right now, that is going to create a civil war situation.
[00:32:29.836 --> 00:32:35.219]  So they're going to be partly responsible for it, as one of the biggest platforms silencing people.
[00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:36.920]  They're only going to drive them underground.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.843]  They're only going to make them more angry, more extreme on both sides.
[00:32:41.243 --> 00:32:51.128]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:32:51.189 --> 00:32:53.510]  Conspiracy theories is an easy target.
[00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:58.673]  There are some who worry this is a slippery slope where people with different viewpoints could be silenced.
[00:33:06.454 --> 00:33:09.097]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.680]  Los Angeles.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.821]  Clone Radio.
[00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:37.883]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:41.345]  Clone.
[00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:42.325]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:43.626]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:33:43.946 --> 00:33:44.807]  Mao took the guns.
[00:33:44.987 --> 00:33:46.307]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:50.429]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.791]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:33:55.872 --> 00:33:58.874]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.064]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:20.709]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:35.440]  You're tuned in to the front line of the resistance, to the strongest resistance point that's civilian on this planet against the globalists and their criminal operations.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.763]  And I don't say that from a position of bragging.
[00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:41.745]  I say it from a position of like Colonel Travis at the Alamo.
[00:34:43.075 --> 00:34:44.235]  But nevertheless, it's true.
[00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:47.696]  All right.
[00:34:49.277 --> 00:34:50.657]  Let me get back to this Limbaugh clip.
[00:34:51.497 --> 00:34:55.959]  And the fact that I'll show you in the manifesto, he doesn't use the term false flag.
[00:34:58.119 --> 00:35:08.062]  But this cretin, Brenton Tarrant, says he's doing this to blame groups he's not affiliated with to cause a societal collision.
[00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:13.845]  What did Dick Cheney write in the PNAC document, April 2000?
[00:35:16.226 --> 00:35:17.927]  Published, Project for the American Century.
[00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:22.510]  Rebuilding America's defenses.
[00:35:26.212 --> 00:35:27.253]  He said a lot of true stuff.
[00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:30.314]  He said the Chinese and others are developing race-specific weapons, we better do it.
[00:35:32.075 --> 00:35:34.356]  That means, announce we got them.
[00:35:35.777 --> 00:35:36.418]  As a deterrent.
[00:35:36.518 --> 00:35:38.779]  But then he went on and said, we had a Pearl Harbor event,
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.283]  So we can take over the Middle East and then clash it with the West.
[00:35:44.845 --> 00:35:47.827]  To have the battle with the Muslims now instead of when there are three billion of them.
[00:35:48.228 --> 00:35:49.389]  Which there'll be in just a few years now.
[00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:55.635]  Now you can say, oh our government's so good then for helping fund the groups and letting them attack us so we'd wake up.
[00:35:57.396 --> 00:35:59.038]  But then instead they bring even more in.
[00:35:59.058 --> 00:36:00.880]  I mean let's just be honest about this.
[00:36:03.092 --> 00:36:09.933]  I've interviewed the former CIA section chiefs and folks on the air that were, know all the top generals that were in the boardrooms when all this went down.
[00:36:10.173 --> 00:36:15.534]  Let's stop pretending that 9-11 wasn't an inside job by criminals in our own government.
[00:36:16.495 --> 00:36:17.735]  Allied with radical Islam.
[00:36:22.276 --> 00:36:29.017]  Telling our military, wink wink, we're letting it happen, so we can then rise up and defeat the Islamic threat.
[00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:39.568]  Before they become too powerful, but then it was a double cross to actually get rid of the non-radical Muslims, and then open Europe's borders and ours, and bring in the really radical Muslims!
[00:36:40.288 --> 00:36:41.388]  A triple cross!
[00:36:44.249 --> 00:36:47.489]  This is what's discussed in real Pentagon boardrooms.
[00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:51.550]  This is what's discussed at Fortune 10 boardrooms, boys and girls.
[00:36:52.791 --> 00:36:54.171]  That's why they want me off the air.
[00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:56.531]  They can't stand this show.
[00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:59.632]  This is highest level what they're doing.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.060]  And now look how it's popularized.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.801]  We all know about false flags.
[00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:18.424]  Where Rush Limbaugh comes out and says, a lot of people look at the angles, and this guy's saying he was a leftist, and say he's doing this to blunt, he spent a lot of time in Pakistan, looks like he may have been connected to Muslims in Serbia.
[00:37:21.064 --> 00:37:21.964]  It's the perfect event.
[00:37:22.265 --> 00:37:26.365]  If the left got smart, they start staging false flags against themselves.
[00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:27.526]  It's the only card they've got left.
[00:37:27.826 --> 00:37:28.366]  And then it happens.
[00:37:29.465 --> 00:37:29.965]  Right on time.
[00:37:30.265 --> 00:37:32.527]  Am I saying it's that type of false flag?
[00:37:32.947 --> 00:37:33.667]  I don't know.
[00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:40.270]  But he says in his manifesto he's doing it to start a war.
[00:37:41.411 --> 00:37:51.256]  Well, it's listed in Encyclopedia Britannica, and it's listed in Jane's Weapons Quarterly, and it's listed by the Army War College, the Naval War College, and West Point.
[00:37:53.382 --> 00:38:02.905]  And the CIA factbook that Operation Himmler and Gleiwitz launched World War II by the German Army staging military attacks on itself and blaming Poland.
[00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:04.726]  They were real attacks.
[00:38:05.206 --> 00:38:06.506]  Some real people got killed.
[00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:10.168]  But it was blamed on Poland and it launched World War II.
[00:38:10.528 --> 00:38:11.808]  That's a false flag.
[00:38:11.988 --> 00:38:12.889]  There it is, Wikipedia.
[00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:13.989]  Operation Himmler.
[00:38:15.952 --> 00:38:32.919]  Often less known as Operation Conserve or Operation Canned Goods, was a 1939 false flag project planned by Nazi Germany to create an appearance of Polish aggression against Germany, which was subsequently used by the Nazis to justify the invasion of Poland.
[00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:39.241]  This included staging false attacks on themselves using innocent people or concentration camp prisoners.
[00:38:39.622 --> 00:38:43.463]  By the way, this wasn't on Wikipedia until I went and dug it out of the National Archives and put it online.
[00:38:44.043 --> 00:38:49.106]  Operation Himmler was arguably the first act of the Second World War.
[00:38:53.808 --> 00:38:56.929]  Let me see if I got the Nazis right seeing the photo earlier without seeing the names.
[00:38:58.171 --> 00:39:02.795]  You've got Joseph Hubber, Arthur Nobel, Heinrich Himmler.
[00:39:02.815 --> 00:39:03.476]  I got that one right.
[00:39:03.556 --> 00:39:04.336]  Reinhard Heinrich.
[00:39:04.357 --> 00:39:04.937]  I got that right.
[00:39:05.417 --> 00:39:06.278]  And Heinrich Mueller.
[00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:08.580]  I guess Heinrich Mueller looked a lot like Zeb Dietrich.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.261]  I got that one wrong.
[00:39:10.642 --> 00:39:12.564]  I'm not bragging, but can the average person look at a...
[00:39:14.022 --> 00:39:16.865]  Second string group of Nazis, one of them first string, I can tell you the name.
[00:39:17.165 --> 00:39:18.326]  I've done my homework.
[00:39:18.646 --> 00:39:20.208]  I can look at World War I leaders.
[00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:24.431]  I can look at the Russian leaders, the Japanese leaders, the Chinese leaders.
[00:39:24.531 --> 00:39:25.572]  I've done my studying.
[00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:27.554]  And how does the CNN respond to that?
[00:39:27.734 --> 00:39:29.296]  They just say, oh, he's crazy.
[00:39:29.556 --> 00:39:31.057]  There's no such thing as false flags.
[00:39:31.257 --> 00:39:33.079]  And I'm not up here bragging that I'm so smart.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.062]  I'm saying, you read his manifesto.
[00:39:36.322 --> 00:39:37.083]  I've read it twice.
[00:39:38.925 --> 00:39:40.467]  He says, I'm trying to start a war!
[00:39:41.007 --> 00:39:42.168]  I'm not who I say I am!
[00:39:42.389 --> 00:39:43.550]  He even tells you!
[00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.653]  And it's very sophisticated!
[00:39:47.734 --> 00:39:49.716]  So you'd be an idiot if you didn't ask.
[00:39:49.916 --> 00:39:52.258]  Here's Rush Limbaugh, stating the obvious, Friday.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.122]  The shooter's objective here was to divide.
[00:39:56.182 --> 00:40:00.246]  I mean, there's... Another thing that happens here when these events happen, you have...
[00:40:02.478 --> 00:40:04.419]  All kinds of speculation that erupts.
[00:40:05.279 --> 00:40:22.806]  And there is an ongoing theory, Mr. Snidley, correct me if I'm wrong about this, there's an ongoing theory that the shooter himself may in fact be a leftist who writes the manifesto and then goes out and performs the deed purposely to smear his political enemies, knowing he's
[00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:32.228]  You're gonna get shot in the process, and you can't immediately discount this.
[00:40:33.209 --> 00:40:46.882]  The left is this insane, they are this crazy, and if that's exactly what the guy's trying to do, then he's hit a home run because right there on Fox News, the shooter is an admitted white nationalist who hates immigrants.
[00:40:53.862 --> 00:41:12.988]  You try to absorb all of this, try to keep some kind of an even keel about it, and then from the manifesto again itself, the shooter says he's not a conservative, not a Christian, and that he identifies as an eco-fascist, which would make him a supporter of the Green New Deal.
[00:41:13.948 --> 00:41:19.370]  He adds that he disagrees with Trump on politics.
[00:41:20.629 --> 00:41:23.871]  And that's Limbaugh reading from Paul Joseph Watson's article on Infowars.com.
[00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:24.311]  I should add.
[00:41:24.811 --> 00:41:25.392]  Word for word.
[00:41:25.472 --> 00:41:25.732]  Fine.
[00:41:26.592 --> 00:41:31.075]  The point is that I'm glad Limbaugh has the courage to point this out.
[00:41:33.656 --> 00:41:42.301]  Because Fox News is saying he's a right-wing white supremacist, but you read his manifesto, he says, I'm a white supremacist, but I'm an eco-fascist.
[00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:43.802]  I love communist China.
[00:41:44.723 --> 00:41:45.503]  Now they do things.
[00:41:47.524 --> 00:41:48.585]  And I'm not against Muslims.
[00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:50.166]  And on and on and on.
[00:41:51.738 --> 00:41:55.079]  But they project it onto all of us and now say Trump's to blame.
[00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:56.959]  He didn't decry the guy enough.
[00:41:57.939 --> 00:41:59.840]  And he didn't decry Charlottesville or white supremacism.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:04.181]  When he did, it's all lies stacked on top of lies.
[00:42:04.241 --> 00:42:10.662]  So, Brenton Tarrant, when we come back, I'll show you where he says he wants a civil war and wants to play us off against each other.
[00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:11.802]  That's a false flag.
[00:42:13.463 --> 00:42:19.464]  When you go do an act to trigger something, when you're trying to get a political aim and when you're doing it against your enemies,
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.820]  I'll talk about the different types of false flags from my view.
[00:42:23.761 --> 00:42:28.442]  No one's ever really quantified all this, at least in any manual that's not secret.
[00:42:29.282 --> 00:42:39.804]  But I, as just a lay researcher obsessed with reality and history, have really documented this to a sickening level.
[00:42:40.744 --> 00:42:42.144]  And now the public's aware of it.
[00:42:42.164 --> 00:42:44.645]  There's no putting it back in the bottle.
[00:42:44.845 --> 00:42:46.045]  No putting Jeannie back in the bottle now.
[00:42:48.103 --> 00:42:54.388]  And again, regardless of whether he didn't stage it to cause a civil war, he said he did, the media is using it to do exactly what he wanted.
[00:42:54.428 --> 00:42:55.609]  They're in lockstep with him.
[00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.311]  Doesn't that tell you something?
[00:42:57.611 --> 00:43:01.014]  The corporate media is in lockstep globally with this dirtbag!
[00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:06.144]  Democrats are pushing for full-term abortions.
[00:43:06.264 --> 00:43:08.185]  The infant would be delivered.
[00:43:08.265 --> 00:43:10.247]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[00:43:10.627 --> 00:43:15.271]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[00:43:15.591 --> 00:43:19.414]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers.
[00:43:19.755 --> 00:43:23.598]  And telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family.
[00:43:23.818 --> 00:43:28.702]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[00:43:28.722 --> 00:43:31.204]  Is it okay to still have children?
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.744]  I told you 24 years ago that the globalists have an anti-human, anti-child agenda.
[00:43:38.685 --> 00:43:41.087]  And back then, it was more secretive, only in their white papers.
[00:43:41.147 --> 00:43:42.267]  Now, it's all over the news.
[00:43:43.108 --> 00:43:52.855]  In fact, Alexandria Cortez, or AOC, doesn't just say you shouldn't have children, but that the world's going to end in 12 years.
[00:43:52.935 --> 00:43:59.560]  And, of course, the governor of Virginia, when he's not running around in blackface, well, he's saying they're going to kill babies after they're born.
[00:44:00.902 --> 00:44:06.143]  And Trump tried to get a bill passed to not kill babies after they're born, which is already the law.
[00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:10.144]  And the Democrats in the Senate shot it down.
[00:44:10.504 --> 00:44:14.825]  Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children.
[00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:22.627]  The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth.
[00:44:23.047 --> 00:44:24.288]  This is America.
[00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.008]  This is the world.
[00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:30.877]  2019 brought to you by the technocrats, the eugenicists, the globalists.
[00:44:31.118 --> 00:44:34.123]  They call themselves fascists, liberals, communists, socialists.
[00:44:34.203 --> 00:44:34.704]  It's all the same.
[00:44:35.734 --> 00:44:36.675]  Watch my film in-game.
[00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:38.597]  It's free online until they delete it.
[00:44:38.617 --> 00:44:40.138]  I made it 11 years ago.
[00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:42.100]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:44:42.681 --> 00:44:59.257]  Now that said, if they can't abort a baby before it's born, or now kill it after it's born, and not fill them full of all these toxic vaccines tainted by design to brain damage them, if they can't fry us with electromagnetic cell phone radiation or GMO, or brainwash us with this toxic culture,
[00:45:00.182 --> 00:45:05.786]  They're going to hit us with people having major mineral and vitamin deficiencies.
[00:45:06.607 --> 00:45:13.472]  And the biggest deficiency in the mainline studies in America and around the world is pure iodine.
[00:45:14.293 --> 00:45:15.093]  In fact, going back in the 20s,
[00:45:16.394 --> 00:45:21.018]  The IQs were 15, 20, 25, 30 points lower.
[00:45:21.078 --> 00:45:25.002]  There was major deformity, major gout, major problems with the thyroid.
[00:45:25.342 --> 00:45:32.168]  And the federal government put a cruddy form of iodine in the salt and IQs went up on average 15 points.
[00:45:32.568 --> 00:45:33.949]  The deformities went way down.
[00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.793]  Our environment is lacking iodine.
[00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:45.599]  That's why coastal populations live longer on average, because they do get some seafood that has some iodine, but a lot of that seafood is contaminated.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:52.003]  And of course, in the olden days, until just like a hundred years ago, people ground up bones and put it in their bread.
[00:45:52.184 --> 00:45:58.227]  Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, be they alive or be they dead, I'll grind their bones to make my bread.
[00:45:59.608 --> 00:46:03.491]  But the good news is, for your children, for adults, for everybody,
[00:46:04.372 --> 00:46:12.616]  We have the pure deep earth crystal iodine in original X2 that nobody else has and nobody else has brought to market.
[00:46:12.756 --> 00:46:18.139]  Now I brought out X3 because some scientists said you need all three types of iodine and some folks like it better.
[00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:22.281]  But I was able to secure with the original manufacturer
[00:46:22.981 --> 00:46:47.783]  A better deal by breaking my deal with them and playing guts ball where it's only been sold out for a couple months and we got the new deal done just about a month ago and they are manufacturing it now so people get on the waiting list in about two weeks we'll be shipping x2 original all deep earth crystal pure atomic iodine directly to your door
[00:46:48.684 --> 00:46:49.485]  Across the world.
[00:46:49.925 --> 00:46:50.745]  X2's back.
[00:46:51.086 --> 00:46:52.086]  It'll be here in two weeks.
[00:46:52.987 --> 00:46:56.189]  This is a blessing, so get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:46:56.249 --> 00:47:00.391]  Again, thank you for your support, but support your own body with the purest, best iodine out there.
[00:47:00.772 --> 00:47:02.172]  X2 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:06.495 --> 00:47:09.057]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.244 --> 00:47:29.049]  Keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel.
[00:47:34.235 --> 00:47:40.382]  Monday through Friday.
[00:47:46.189 --> 00:47:46.990]  I'm here 11 a.m.
[00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:47.590]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:47.950]  Central.
[00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:51.232]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:47:51.252 --> 00:47:54.734]  The dreaded most banned, most lied about, most demonized sites in the world.
[00:47:55.315 --> 00:48:06.122]  And then... Don't forget... We've got... The Sunday Transmission, which you are right smack dab in the middle of right now.
[00:48:08.923 --> 00:48:13.907]  By the way, I haven't been harping on the tragic shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand.
[00:48:14.893 --> 00:48:17.295]  At the mosque, for lack of news.
[00:48:18.096 --> 00:48:20.278]  Oh, we've got human-animal clones mainstream.
[00:48:20.578 --> 00:48:22.900]  We've got CRISPR-edited humans rolling out.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.702]  Suddenly it's not just China, there's edited humans.
[00:48:26.142 --> 00:48:27.083]  Oh, for a long time!
[00:48:27.163 --> 00:48:28.184]  See, it's just all coming out.
[00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:29.946]  Like I told you 20 years ago.
[00:48:31.046 --> 00:48:35.828]  I mean, they had, like I said, the 1950s, virtual reality systems, everything.
[00:48:36.648 --> 00:48:37.908]  There's a breakaway civilization.
[00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.129]  We're going to be talking about that next hour.
[00:48:39.669 --> 00:48:44.410]  The Democrats are moving AOC towards the airlock to blow her out the door, which is unfortunate.
[00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:48.911]  We'd like her to stay around as long as possible, just for the horrific entertainment value itself.
[00:48:49.712 --> 00:48:52.172]  Beto is showing what an empty shirt he is.
[00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:54.413]  Empty suit as well.
[00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:57.094]  We've got a big stack of news I want to get to.
[00:48:58.305 --> 00:49:02.908]  Where thematically, no one's making this point, but thematically you just see it in the news.
[00:49:03.428 --> 00:49:06.470]  That the Democrats have weaponized the youth of this country, that's coming up.
[00:49:07.651 --> 00:49:11.073]  And of course the big enchilada I'm gonna cover at the start of the next hour.
[00:49:12.614 --> 00:49:22.160]  And that's the Achilles heel of these quote, drag queen events being held from Germany to England to the United States to Canada.
[00:49:22.581 --> 00:49:26.043]  All choreographed exactly the same, run by the same group.
[00:49:27.526 --> 00:49:28.686]  And promoted by mainstream media.
[00:49:30.607 --> 00:49:31.927]  All you gotta do is go.
[00:49:33.327 --> 00:49:36.668]  And all you gotta do is pick out the obvious creepoids, including those involved.
[00:49:37.328 --> 00:49:38.969]  And all you gotta do is go get their license plate.
[00:49:40.569 --> 00:49:45.510]  Or, if you've got the proper accreditation in law enforcement or private detectives, follow them home, even with their own foot.
[00:49:46.251 --> 00:49:47.991]  People are like, don't tell them they're getting their plate numbers.
[00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:49.691]  We're not stupid.
[00:49:50.232 --> 00:49:50.872]  I want them to know.
[00:49:50.892 --> 00:49:51.572]  I want them to stop it.
[00:49:53.052 --> 00:49:56.515]  The point is, is that how do pedophiles come after your kids?
[00:49:56.696 --> 00:49:59.398]  They dress up like women in disguises.
[00:50:00.399 --> 00:50:05.404]  My God, it's 101 pedos dress up like clowns or other things, so their identity's not known.
[00:50:05.804 --> 00:50:08.307]  This is out in the open!
[00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.172]  And now the busts are beginning.
[00:50:13.572 --> 00:50:16.435]  And I just, I'm not sure who's involved in this, but...
[00:50:18.953 --> 00:50:24.494]  Let's just say this, when you buy products at Infowarstore.com, you're not just financing a radio show or a TV show.
[00:50:27.469 --> 00:50:29.971]  I'm weaponized, and everybody knows that.
[00:50:30.091 --> 00:50:31.151]  I'm not playing games.
[00:50:31.512 --> 00:50:44.640]  You go up against these people, oh by the way, you don't just think this convicted child rapist in Houston, who is running the story time for kids, not just by the way at libraries, it's going on public schools, you name it, the government's trying to cover it up, the local government is, it's all coming out.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.161]  You don't just think, he stops there.
[00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:50.864]  These people, like him, are the operatives
[00:50:51.824 --> 00:50:58.005]  As I've told you, everything in Bram Stoker's books are allegories to how the elites actually operated.
[00:50:59.946 --> 00:51:06.707]  And you've got the Renfield that just wants to strangle kids and have sex with them and, you know, eat brooches and things.
[00:51:07.488 --> 00:51:08.128]  Men are rats.
[00:51:09.688 --> 00:51:10.968]  But who's he work for?
[00:51:11.028 --> 00:51:13.929]  He works for the Dragon.
[00:51:18.732 --> 00:51:21.395]  And the dragon's mistresses want blood of babies.
[00:51:23.597 --> 00:51:29.824]  And you look at the Transylvanian elite that became the German elite, the Austro-Hungarian elite that became the British elite.
[00:51:30.845 --> 00:51:37.633]  And they famously, not just Vlad the Impaler, but his offspring, they would bathe in blood, they would eat children, they would do all this.
[00:51:39.994 --> 00:51:40.835]  The villager's all new.
[00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:42.196]  Don't get near Dracula Castle.
[00:51:42.856 --> 00:51:44.698]  Where does Nosferatu live?
[00:51:44.978 --> 00:51:46.879]  Where does Prince Charles live more than half the year now?
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.620]  He's retired.
[00:51:48.281 --> 00:51:53.565]  He retired to Transylvania and Castle Dracula.
[00:51:56.487 --> 00:52:00.330]  Now by the way, if you're a new listener, this is not a joke.
[00:52:03.292 --> 00:52:05.534]  Just like I told you World War II started with a false flag attack.
[00:52:06.055 --> 00:52:07.015]  And then you go and they admit it now.
[00:52:07.095 --> 00:52:07.576]  They didn't used to.
[00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:17.674]  If you wonder why this is all so demonoid, it's because it literally is a... What does the Bible say?
[00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:18.515]  The devil's a dragon.
[00:52:21.816 --> 00:52:24.218]  And that's what these people are into.
[00:52:24.978 --> 00:52:28.760]  And they've got all these useful idiots that get caught up in the peer pressure and bring their children into it.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.320]  It's nightmarish.
[00:52:31.301 --> 00:52:34.222]  And they literally just hold their babies up and just bring them in for this.
[00:52:34.242 --> 00:52:35.403]  So that's coming up next hour.
[00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:44.005]  You know, I said I'd get into a history of false flags, but anybody can just go research those if you want.
[00:52:45.005 --> 00:52:46.586]  They're part of every major war.
[00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:47.627]  Everybody does it.
[00:52:48.747 --> 00:52:57.872]  You know, our military's not perfect, and I don't think we should engage in dirty tricks, but anybody captain level or higher in Army Special Operations, they even have a manual.
[00:52:58.552 --> 00:53:02.634]  WikiLeaks was one of the first things they released, and they admitted it's real, on how to stage false flags.
[00:53:03.475 --> 00:53:05.676]  As an emergency force multiplier.
[00:53:08.547 --> 00:53:17.511]  And the argument is, well, if the North Vietnamese take over this village, they'll just conscript everybody and we'll have to bomb the whole village and kill all of them.
[00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:25.035]  So we'll kill one little girl and leave paraphernalia and have a witness say that the Viet Cong did it to get the village on our side.
[00:53:25.615 --> 00:53:27.076]  So it's going to save lives.
[00:53:27.556 --> 00:53:29.437]  And let's just kill this little girl as quickly as can.
[00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:30.978]  We're not going to enjoy it, but we're real men.
[00:53:31.298 --> 00:53:32.038]  We're willing to do it.
[00:53:32.238 --> 00:53:37.721]  Or you say that the Iraqis beat the brains out of the babies in the incubators to launch the war.
[00:53:40.438 --> 00:53:41.239]  And then it kills millions.
[00:53:41.279 --> 00:53:44.922]  I mean, this is the soup in which we swim.
[00:53:47.484 --> 00:53:48.805]  But let me just shift gears for a moment.
[00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:53.249]  And this ties into the tragic events in New Zealand in a big way, but also ties into InfoWars.
[00:53:53.830 --> 00:54:03.558]  What did the head lawyer with the CEO of Twitter say was the final reason I was taken off Twitter?
[00:54:04.519 --> 00:54:07.322]  They said that I abused and beat up a child.
[00:54:08.376 --> 00:54:13.520]  And they got corrected and they go, well, he showed video of a kid hitting an adult six, seven times.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.521]  The adult pushes the kid down.
[00:54:14.721 --> 00:54:15.602]  It was all over the news.
[00:54:16.502 --> 00:54:19.565]  But see, oh, Alex Jones shows that you're not allowed to.
[00:54:22.627 --> 00:54:25.810]  And they can misrepresent it because I'm banned off those platforms, say whatever they want.
[00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:34.076]  Well, Australian senator slapped with egg, which can put your eye out, upside the head by teen after criticizing mass immigration.
[00:54:34.316 --> 00:54:35.858]  The media called him a little boy.
[00:54:36.198 --> 00:54:36.798]  He's 16 years old.
[00:54:38.766 --> 00:54:39.627]  They say he punched him.
[00:54:39.647 --> 00:54:40.847]  They actually have the angle from behind.
[00:54:40.887 --> 00:54:42.829]  He just slapped him and got him off of him.
[00:54:43.569 --> 00:54:49.473]  And now the premier, the leftist premier, wants him arrested, and they're saying, good job, attack conservatives.
[00:54:49.934 --> 00:55:00.241]  All this senator said was that every time somebody runs over 200-something people in France, killing 100 of them plus, there's almost no coverage of who they are or what happened.
[00:55:00.521 --> 00:55:03.003]  They say it's not Islam, even though they're yelling Allah Akbar.
[00:55:10.302 --> 00:55:12.163]  And he says it's terrible what happened to this mosque.
[00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:16.564]  But we need to talk about all the Christians getting shot and run over and bombed.
[00:55:16.824 --> 00:55:18.684]  Hundreds of thousands of them in the last few years.
[00:55:19.304 --> 00:55:20.925]  Why is the media only hyping this up?
[00:55:21.105 --> 00:55:22.825]  And you turn on the news, that's all you hear!
[00:55:23.185 --> 00:55:24.946]  Who the parents are, who the kids are.
[00:55:24.966 --> 00:55:27.066]  They're gonna have a funeral, vigils.
[00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:28.607]  Which is fine!
[00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:40.719]  But don't sit there and get mad at us when we say when Islam is killing Christians on purpose everywhere, driving Christians out of every area they've been for 2,000 years, and the media won't cover it.
[00:55:40.759 --> 00:55:41.820]  In fact, they support it!
[00:55:43.481 --> 00:55:48.225]  So then the media demonizes this senator.
[00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:50.747]  I'll give you his name in a moment.
[00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:55.690]  And they condemn him and say he deserves it.
[00:55:57.632 --> 00:55:58.373]  Let's play the video.
[00:55:58.393 --> 00:55:58.713]  Here it is.
[00:56:02.345 --> 00:56:16.336]  A terribly unfortunate thing, a tragedy, but it's going to be eventually accepted or expected that these sort of things happen when people are getting attacked in their own...
[00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:31.132]  So somebody attacks you from behind, hits you in the head, you know, slaps you in the back of the head.
[00:56:31.532 --> 00:56:32.293]  I've had that happen to me.
[00:56:32.313 --> 00:56:37.894]  When I was out in Hawaii, a guy just walks up, while I'm sitting on the beach, and he just slaps me in the back of the head, thinking I'd get in a fight with him.
[00:56:38.634 --> 00:56:39.994]  I said, you're not gonna get what you want, buddy.
[00:56:41.195 --> 00:56:44.215]  Now, they're saying the Senator should be charged.
[00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:45.496]  The Premier of Australia is.
[00:56:45.816 --> 00:56:50.237]  Let's show the footage shot behind the 16-year-old, who looks like he's about 5'11".
[00:56:50.937 --> 00:56:52.137]  Frazier, Senator Frazier.
[00:56:53.197 --> 00:56:54.378]  Frazier, and he's a big guy.
[00:56:54.858 --> 00:56:55.118]  Here it is.
[00:56:57.045 --> 00:56:59.106]  All he does is slap the punk.
[00:57:02.087 --> 00:57:03.627]  And very fast, he's got good instincts.
[00:57:03.948 --> 00:57:05.248]  Somebody attacks you from behind.
[00:57:05.368 --> 00:57:16.172]  Now, they'll probably announce I beat up the kid, and they'll probably announce that I am in child endangerment for showing you a video on CNN, Fox, and every other channel.
[00:57:16.192 --> 00:57:18.113]  Remember, I showed a kid
[00:57:21.525 --> 00:57:25.327]  Attacking an adult, the adult pushes him down, and the media, Forbes had to retract it!
[00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:27.168]  They said it was me!
[00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:30.310]  We're gonna go to break, please don't forget.
[00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:37.153]  We have store-wide free shipping, haven't had this special in three months, and 50% off all the supplements and double Patriot points.
[00:57:37.374 --> 00:57:41.476]  That means with your little profile, your next order won't get 5% off the next order, it'll get 10%.
[00:57:41.896 --> 00:57:45.758]  And if you sign up for auto-ship, cancelling time for free, an additional 10% off the next order.
[00:57:45.938 --> 00:57:46.679]  All the supplements.
[00:57:47.859 --> 00:57:49.720]  X2, we got it again, it's back in stock.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:50.701]  Brain Force, everything.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:58:08.950]  In previous revolutions, some good, some bad, the revolutionaries funded themselves by robbing stagecoaches full of gold, or robbing trains full of silver, or basically going through the countryside and pillaging.
[00:58:09.911 --> 00:58:14.393]  Well, we've been blessed the 21st century in this great free market system that we've got.
[00:58:16.155 --> 00:58:21.058]  To be able to just use the free market and high quality products and the rules of commerce
[00:58:22.182 --> 00:58:32.147]  To go out and get great products that people get great results from and then discount those products to you so that it becomes a total 360 win.
[00:58:32.727 --> 00:58:38.230]  And I obsess over that term that I coined years ago because that's really what I believe in.
[00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:42.873]  It's a non-zero-sum game where everybody basically benefits.
[00:58:42.953 --> 00:58:48.075]  It's beyond just symbiotic where everybody kind of works with each other and everybody makes it.
[00:58:48.356 --> 00:58:50.817]  This is where we have an even better future together.
[00:58:52.082 --> 00:58:53.366]  And so we're not robbing banks here.
[00:58:54.328 --> 00:58:57.176]  We're not engaged in criminal activity to fund our operations.
[00:58:58.567 --> 00:59:01.609]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaged in good old-fashioned free market.
[00:59:01.629 --> 00:59:05.151]  It doesn't mean the whole world's free market, it doesn't mean America's perfect free market.
[00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:12.475]  We have socialism, we have communist tendencies, we have these parasitic systems nesting inside the free market capitalist system.
[00:59:12.975 --> 00:59:23.701]  But Infowars itself is a pretty much pure form of Americana free market capitalism, and your participation in it is a beautiful part of that.
[00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:25.382]  So, throughout the month,
[00:59:26.716 --> 00:59:36.021]  Of March, in the few weeks we have left, we're offering store-wide free shipping and 50% off all our best-selling supplements and a bunch of other huge specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:36.542 --> 00:59:39.083]  And again, InfoWarsStore.com is the main mothership site.
[00:59:39.664 --> 00:59:42.205]  InfoWarsLife.com will take you right to the supplement pages.
[00:59:42.605 --> 00:59:52.331]  Whether it's books, videos, non-gmo heirloom seeds, t-shirts, ball caps, whatever it is, it's high quality, it spreads the word, and it funds the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:59:57.026 --> 01:00:00.987]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.434 --> 01:00:28.416]  Drag Queen Story Hour or Sex Offender Story Hour.
[01:00:43.889 --> 01:00:54.176]  And now we've got something to show you, and we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[01:00:54.956 --> 01:01:05.382]  What we're going to show you is going to leave an impression on them, and we hope the impression will be that they grow up, if they're 3 or 4 or 5 years old, to become 7 or 8 year old drag queens and ballers.
[01:01:07.782 --> 01:01:08.703]  Isn't it nice?
[01:01:09.383 --> 01:01:10.404]  Sugar and spice.
[01:01:11.025 --> 01:01:13.787]  Luring disco darlings to a life of vice.
[01:01:13.967 --> 01:01:17.070]  I can make a film and make you my star.
[01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.932]  You'd be a natural the way you are.
[01:01:19.952 --> 01:01:24.255]  You've got the attraction, you've got the pulling power.
[01:01:24.496 --> 01:01:27.558]  Walk my little doggie, walk my little sexy.
[01:01:27.858 --> 01:01:30.561]  They all love your miniature ways.
[01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:34.143]  You know what they say about small noise.
[01:01:38.725 --> 01:02:01.661]  Sex Dwarf, looking to procure Run little doggie, learn a disco dolly Run my little Sex Dwarf, I'm so lonely Get my little camera, take a pretty picture Sex Dwarf, it's a bit nice Learn disco dollies to a nine-half ice
[01:02:08.732 --> 01:02:11.832]  How did this happen, and why am I not surprised?
[01:02:12.132 --> 01:02:21.715]  It turns out that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at Houston's Public Library as part of its Drag Time Story Hour.
[01:02:21.915 --> 01:02:26.776]  Is this what happens when we allow adult entertainers to entertain our children?
[01:02:26.796 --> 01:02:35.798]  32-year-old Tatiana Malanina, whose real name is Albert Garza, was criminally charged for sexually assaulting a child.
[01:02:36.158 --> 01:02:45.724]  A concerned activist group called Mass Resistance had been asking the city of Houston for information about the drag queens for months with no answer.
[01:02:45.904 --> 01:02:56.950]  The group did their own digging only to discover that a registered sex offender had been allowed to participate in Drag Queen Story Hour at Houston's public library.
[01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:12.873]  A media spokesperson for the library confirmed one of the program's drag queens, with the alias Tatiana Malanina, is 5'11", 200-pound Alberto Garza, a 32-year-old child sex offender.
[01:03:13.273 --> 01:03:25.615]  The Houston Public Library has now admitted that a proper background check on Garza was not carried out, but that he will not be invited to participate in any future library programs.
[01:03:26.275 --> 01:03:36.106]  In 2017, I went undercover as my SJW alter ego Rainbow Snatch to investigate the Austin International Drag Festival.
[01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:38.488]  I'm all about education.
[01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:40.991]  I actually do story time with drag queens in Chicago.
[01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:41.211]  Right?
[01:03:44.146 --> 01:03:44.206]  Yes!
[01:03:44.506 --> 01:03:46.167]  Family programming!
[01:03:46.928 --> 01:03:48.048]  Love it!
[01:03:48.108 --> 01:03:48.248]  Yes!
[01:03:48.428 --> 01:03:57.353]  I was appalled to find children being mixed into an adult entertainment drag show, both as drag performers and as attendees.
[01:03:58.073 --> 01:04:12.681]  Drag queens in provocative attire with names such as Cunty Hornet, Macy's Some Cocks, Muffy Fish Basket, and Poo Poo Platter danced inappropriately and made adult jokes, all in the presence of young children.
[01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:17.804]  While men appearing as Johns stared lustfully and threw money at them.
[01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:29.953]  So is it any surprise that this registered sex offender, Tatiana Malanina, is also listed as a performer at the 2016 Austin International Drag Festival?
[01:04:30.273 --> 01:04:43.704]  Exposing children to drag performers is now considered to be teaching children tolerance and inclusivity amongst progressive liberals, when all that is happening is child exploitation and traumatization.
[01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:48.287]  Which might just be exposing children to registered sex offenders.
[01:04:48.307 --> 01:04:52.951]  It's time to break the trance.
[01:04:53.972 --> 01:04:57.054]  It's time to stand up for our most vulnerable.
[01:04:57.114 --> 01:04:57.495]  It's time.
[01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:00.177]  Spread the video you just watched.
[01:05:04.038 --> 01:05:07.919]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[01:05:08.699 --> 01:05:12.499]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:05:12.939 --> 01:05:19.961]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:23.101]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:05:24.001 --> 01:05:27.482]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:31.783]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:05:31.943 --> 01:05:33.503]  We are the power structure.
[01:05:33.983 --> 01:05:35.024]  We are the inventors.
[01:05:35.604 --> 01:05:36.644]  We are the trailblazers.
[01:05:37.364 --> 01:05:40.225]  And the globalists understand that.
[01:05:40.765 --> 01:05:46.727]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[01:05:47.887 --> 01:05:51.688]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[01:05:52.751 --> 01:06:03.259]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at importstore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[01:06:03.279 --> 01:06:21.113]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.367 --> 01:06:39.270]  There is a report posted to NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com that out of her hundreds of reports, some of which have six, seven, eight million views apiece, is probably her most powerful.
[01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.411]  It's on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:06:43.471 --> 01:06:46.812]  It's on Millie Weaver, InfoWars.com reporter's YouTube site.
[01:06:47.292 --> 01:06:48.832]  Story time with sex offenders.
[01:06:50.011 --> 01:06:50.591]  Please get it.
[01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:51.512]  Please share it.
[01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.233]  And, hey, they send it to you on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[01:06:54.273 --> 01:06:55.333]  Share it by text message.
[01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:57.214]  Share it by email.
[01:06:57.254 --> 01:06:58.394]  Share it by word of mouth.
[01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.335]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:07:00.615 --> 01:07:01.415]  They can't stop you.
[01:07:01.455 --> 01:07:01.896]  Don't let them.
[01:07:03.796 --> 01:07:08.258]  Now, I did some studying in the last three years.
[01:07:09.779 --> 01:07:11.659]  I knew that global elites are into pedophilia.
[01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:18.602]  I knew that particularly British intelligence and EU intelligence would use pedophilia as an induction or a
[01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:25.755]  Right of passage, a gang initiation, so they knew people were totally compromised.
[01:07:26.096 --> 01:07:27.377]  Because no one would put up with that.
[01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:39.529]  But then I began to see on ABC, NBC, CNN, AP, local news, oh, the most wonderful thing in the world.
[01:07:40.401 --> 01:07:50.205]  Instead of it being the most wonderful time of the year, Christmas or something, or Thanksgiving the family, or an NFL game, you know, as bad as those are, at least it's more family than this.
[01:07:52.366 --> 01:07:55.347]  And it would be big, obese, scary.
[01:07:57.568 --> 01:07:57.908]  Men.
[01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:09.013]  At drag queen events, at public schools, and at libraries, and in many cases, the parents aren't being told.
[01:08:09.906 --> 01:08:18.049]  They're just coming and talking to your kids about their sexuality and telling them, shake their booty and you can be a boy if you're a girl, you can be a girl if you're a boy.
[01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:30.454]  And so I started saying that people needed to, law enforcement needed to, citizens needed to, private citizens can hire PIs if you've got the money.
[01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:32.255]  I know, we've
[01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:34.690]  Done a few things.
[01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:42.393]  And all you gotta do is go to these events and then go out to the car of these people and about a third of the time they're sex offenders.
[01:08:42.673 --> 01:08:49.195]  Or about half the time they're an armed robber or they're a convicted murderer.
[01:08:52.757 --> 01:08:55.858]  But bottom line, imagine if men dressed like
[01:08:57.759 --> 01:09:00.301]  Power Ranger villains is the best way to describe them.
[01:09:00.821 --> 01:09:02.943]  My sister's 15 years younger than me, and I'm 45.
[01:09:03.603 --> 01:09:17.053]  She's like, I guess, 30 now, but when I was, you know, when she was a kid, she watched Power Rangers, and the Power Ranger monster would have crazy hair and big scary teeth and, you know, weird makeup and would go, ah, Power Ranger, I will get you, ah!
[01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.014]  Like, get the clown.
[01:09:27.003 --> 01:09:34.805]  So, they sell it as, oh, it's not even transvestites, it's not even transsexuals, it's not even... No, no, it's just drag time!
[01:09:36.266 --> 01:09:41.127]  And whether it's Germany, or whether it's England, or whether it's Canada or the U.S., it's the same program.
[01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:43.488]  I've gone and watched with horror.
[01:09:45.328 --> 01:09:46.909]  It's a major initiative against our children.
[01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:49.049]  You've seen it all over the news.
[01:09:49.530 --> 01:09:54.211]  I've watched in abject... horror.
[01:09:58.578 --> 01:10:01.541]  While this goes on, I've watched the entire programs they put out.
[01:10:01.821 --> 01:10:02.622]  An hour long.
[01:10:03.342 --> 01:10:04.203]  And it's always the same.
[01:10:05.184 --> 01:10:07.206]  They go, it's okay to be what you want.
[01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:08.688]  You could be a boy if you're a girl.
[01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:09.648]  You could be a girl if you're a boy.
[01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:10.589]  Touch your booty.
[01:10:10.649 --> 01:10:11.230]  Shake your booty.
[01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:12.831]  I'm gonna play you some of these sickening videos.
[01:10:13.392 --> 01:10:15.754]  And then they go, we're grooming you.
[01:10:16.155 --> 01:10:17.956]  You're all gonna be drag queens.
[01:10:18.016 --> 01:10:19.458]  In fact, see if you can cue that back up.
[01:10:20.356 --> 01:10:23.038]  I've never seen that clip, my God, of the convicted murderer.
[01:10:23.618 --> 01:10:25.580]  We already had the clip of him that hangs out with these little kids.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:33.166]  Oh, there's a convicted murderer who's on national TV who launched the whole movement to recruit children into this.
[01:10:33.206 --> 01:10:43.193]  He says on video, in a new video, that bring your impressionable children for what we're about to teach them because it's graphic and it's not proper for children.
[01:10:45.895 --> 01:10:47.016]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:10:48.322 --> 01:10:51.824]  And they go to city council members and they go, we are grooming your children.
[01:10:54.385 --> 01:10:57.006]  So, I always give you the background before I get into the new breaking news.
[01:10:57.127 --> 01:11:12.835]  Should have started the segment with convicted child rapists not allowed to be within a thousand feet of a school or school event or is having kids sit on his lap telling them, tell me about your booty.
[01:11:13.255 --> 01:11:14.455]  Now, why hasn't he been arrested?
[01:11:14.475 --> 01:11:17.217]  We're going to tell you all about it and play some shocking clips here.
[01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:21.231]  But the good news is parents are protesting this everywhere.
[01:11:21.551 --> 01:11:34.615]  And now that they know how to get the person's real name and run their plates, because notice, the public schools are doing it, the libraries are doing it, the community centers are doing it, and normally somebody that's going to be around kids has to do a background check.
[01:11:35.176 --> 01:11:40.277]  Oh, they're a school principal or a coach or a teacher or a librarian, but not these people because they're protected.
[01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:42.798]  They're the vanguard of what's happening.
[01:11:43.919 --> 01:11:44.799]  So here's the Daily Mail.
[01:11:45.939 --> 01:11:50.260]  Library let convicted sex offender read to kids as young as 2 in drag.
[01:11:51.301 --> 01:11:59.563]  Now, when KHOU was forced to first report on this last Thursday, they said, oh, he was arrested for something with children.
[01:11:59.843 --> 01:12:01.844]  No, he was convicted and given 10 years.
[01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:03.185]  He served 5.
[01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.165]  He's not allowed to be around children ever.
[01:12:05.545 --> 01:12:06.486]  He's on probation.
[01:12:06.746 --> 01:12:07.706]  Why hasn't he been arrested?
[01:12:08.986 --> 01:12:10.247]  We actually got his record.
[01:12:10.287 --> 01:12:12.267]  Nobody else has this.
[01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:12.988]  We have his record.
[01:12:13.008 --> 01:12:13.668]  We'll give it to you in a moment.
[01:12:15.209 --> 01:12:18.050]  And under law, his record should be public, but they're trying to cover it up.
[01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:24.411]  Houston highlights LibraryW's Drag Queen Story Time.
[01:12:26.192 --> 01:12:30.133]  And they've got names like Muffy Fish Bucket Pants.
[01:12:31.173 --> 01:12:32.573]  So really gross terms towards women.
[01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:38.975]  And imagine big, giant, fat men in really scary outfits with the kids looking scared.
[01:12:40.063 --> 01:12:41.544]  Their parents are telling them it's okay.
[01:12:41.564 --> 01:12:46.508]  The kids are leaning back over their parents, grabbing their parents and teachers legs and arms.
[01:12:46.568 --> 01:12:51.211]  The children are recoiling at huge big fat men!
[01:12:51.711 --> 01:12:58.576]  But their weird leftist mothers are like pushing them towards them with a big fat man shaking their butt in their face.
[01:13:01.058 --> 01:13:01.679]  Think about that.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.882]  And then Howard Stern has guest on making fun of me saying this is wrong.
[01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.784]  I don't think Howard Stern's into this.
[01:13:10.427 --> 01:13:14.631]  I'm sure he's gonna do the right thing and come out and say something.
[01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:29.504]  So, now we have Alberto, Albert Alfonso Garcia, 32, and we have him leading the operation in Houston, a convicted rapist of an 8-year-old boy.
[01:13:29.524 --> 01:13:34.529]  And we have the media not telling you what's in his record.
[01:13:35.509 --> 01:13:39.190]  He's convicted of aggravated sexual assault, rape of an eight-year-old boy.
[01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:41.690]  He's listed as a moderate risk to re-offend.
[01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.950]  Well, I don't think that moderate's up to high risk.
[01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:44.851]  He's targeting kids.
[01:13:45.711 --> 01:13:47.631]  Has to register as a sex offender for life.
[01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.912]  Last checked in with Houston PD in February 2019.
[01:13:51.132 --> 01:13:54.332]  Sentenced to prison for 10 years.
[01:13:54.492 --> 01:13:54.992]  Got out.
[01:13:55.612 --> 01:13:57.233]  And has five years community supervision.
[01:13:58.873 --> 01:14:00.213]  Oh, the community's supervising him.
[01:14:00.253 --> 01:14:02.114]  He's with your children right now.
[01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:04.534]  So let's go to local news.
[01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:13.863]  This is original local news, KHOU, same one covering up for him, saying Library debuts Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:14:14.124 --> 01:14:18.908]  Here he is with others telling your two-year-olds to shake their ass.
[01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:19.929]  Here it is.
[01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:27.537]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:31.221]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:34.430]  Good morning, everybody!
[01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:38.693]  The Heights Library had a special guest for story time.
[01:14:39.154 --> 01:14:39.794]  Oh my goodness.
[01:14:40.155 --> 01:14:41.476]  Everyone is dressed so nice.
[01:14:41.536 --> 01:14:43.497]  I wish I would have worn a nice costume for y'all.
[01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:47.360]  A visitor who usually performs for an older audience.
[01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:49.022]  My name is Blackberry.
[01:14:49.162 --> 01:14:50.523]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[01:14:51.804 --> 01:14:53.145]  We're gonna come back and play all this.
[01:14:53.225 --> 01:14:54.265]  No, you're not a lady.
[01:14:54.565 --> 01:15:00.147]  You're a big, giant, fat black man with a huge beard, who anyone would be scared of anywhere, whether you're white or black.
[01:15:00.347 --> 01:15:02.048]  You look like a convicted felon.
[01:15:02.568 --> 01:15:04.229]  You look like a crazy person.
[01:15:04.549 --> 01:15:05.649]  You look like a maniac.
[01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:08.650]  If you talk to anybody in a park, they'd run from you and call the police.
[01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:12.692]  Just like your buddy, who's the convicted child rapist, who we're about to show.
[01:15:16.101 --> 01:15:23.305]  They're freaking your kids out in a big, giant, sick exercise, rubbing your noses into it.
[01:15:23.546 --> 01:15:30.330]  And by the way, whether it's New York or Houston or anywhere, they're having one next Friday in New Braunfels, Texas, with your children.
[01:15:31.471 --> 01:15:32.191]  It doesn't matter.
[01:15:33.532 --> 01:15:35.273]  It's all choreographed.
[01:15:38.035 --> 01:15:38.975]  It's all unified.
[01:15:41.277 --> 01:15:43.218]  Why can't we just play George Stray to our children?
[01:15:44.993 --> 01:15:50.498]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:51.499 --> 01:15:52.499]  Will we protect our children?
[01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:55.822]  Probably not.
[01:15:56.102 --> 01:15:58.604]  It's too fun to be demonic, isn't it?
[01:15:58.624 --> 01:16:00.246]  Just feed them to the pedophiles.
[01:16:03.956 --> 01:16:05.296]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:16:05.376 --> 01:16:07.157]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:16:07.277 --> 01:16:07.697]  It is.
[01:16:07.877 --> 01:16:12.278]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:16:12.759 --> 01:16:14.019]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:15.860]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.260]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.441]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:16:21.501 --> 01:16:22.722]  You've got the children's.
[01:16:22.862 --> 01:16:23.822]  You've got the adults.
[01:16:23.982 --> 01:16:24.882]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:16:24.982 --> 01:16:28.343]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:30.744]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[01:16:31.124 --> 01:16:32.986]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[01:16:33.086 --> 01:16:34.087]  You want something like this?
[01:16:34.167 --> 01:16:35.028]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:16:35.128 --> 01:16:36.989]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:16:37.049 --> 01:16:38.191]  It's so good, in my view.
[01:16:38.271 --> 01:16:40.272]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:16:40.312 --> 01:16:44.937]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:16:46.698 --> 01:16:51.263]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:16:54.218 --> 01:17:00.201]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.022]  I just can't do it!
[01:17:03.623 --> 01:17:13.509]  Hey, by now I'm sure that most of you know that there are always big discounts and unbelievable savings on a regular basis at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:17:56.775 --> 01:17:56.835]  Yep.
[01:17:56.855 --> 01:17:58.596]  I've got some really good news, though.
[01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:06.070]  X2's back.
[01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:08.031]  The original X2.
[01:18:08.531 --> 01:18:11.332]  Deep Earth Crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[01:18:11.452 --> 01:18:12.112]  What you want.
[01:18:12.552 --> 01:18:13.612]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:18:13.652 --> 01:18:14.613]  It'll be here in a week.
[01:18:15.093 --> 01:18:16.213]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[01:18:16.633 --> 01:18:17.594]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:18:17.614 --> 01:18:18.954]  With the best iodine in the world.
[01:18:19.414 --> 01:18:20.154]  X2, it's available.
[01:18:20.554 --> 01:18:21.515]  I thought X3's great.
[01:18:21.555 --> 01:18:23.355]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[01:18:23.755 --> 01:18:25.536]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:26.456]  The scientists that do that.
[01:18:26.476 --> 01:18:28.717]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[01:18:29.577 --> 01:18:33.660]  Well, I was resigned to the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.463]  We now have X2 again, and in fullwarestore.com, so hallelujah!
[01:18:38.023 --> 01:18:49.712]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:58.339]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[01:19:03.119 --> 01:19:09.582]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:19:10.942 --> 01:19:13.783]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:19:14.264 --> 01:19:16.845]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:19:17.365 --> 01:19:18.565]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:24.948]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:19:25.488 --> 01:19:28.269]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:32.390]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:36.832]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:19:37.312 --> 01:19:50.578]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:19:50.858 --> 01:19:52.799]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:19:53.439 --> 01:19:58.266]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:19:58.707 --> 01:20:01.210]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:20:06.919 --> 01:20:09.562]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.726 --> 01:20:29.913]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:30.053 --> 01:20:44.483]  So, all over the Western world, there is openly obese, insane, crazy fat people, many of them registered child rapists.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.361]  Shaking their giant butts.
[01:20:47.441 --> 01:20:48.181]  And I don't know why.
[01:20:48.201 --> 01:20:50.142]  You have to weigh over 400 pounds to be part of this.
[01:20:50.643 --> 01:20:53.284]  Dressed up in giant, hit-the-clown demon outfits.
[01:20:53.324 --> 01:20:54.465]  More frightening than hit-the-clown.
[01:20:55.365 --> 01:21:01.369]  And you've got, in Houston, the leader of it is a convicted child sex rapist.
[01:21:02.664 --> 01:21:16.913]  And this is going on at schools, libraries, I've got articles all over the country where parents aren't told in Rhode Island, in Colorado, in California, that your elementary students show up and there's a bunch of these people there and your kids sit on their laps.
[01:21:17.674 --> 01:21:19.835]  I mean, imagine if you have known a neighbor for 10 years.
[01:21:20.095 --> 01:21:20.536]  They're nice.
[01:21:21.755 --> 01:21:22.856]  You've got a five-year-old daughter.
[01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:28.178]  You invite him over for barbecue, and you've known Bob for five years, whatever.
[01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:29.199]  He's a nice guy.
[01:21:29.559 --> 01:21:30.479]  He's a plant manager.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:37.423]  And all of a sudden, your five-year-old daughter's sitting on Bob's lap, and Bob is dressed nice and everything, but Bob starts talking to your daughter about sex.
[01:21:38.043 --> 01:21:40.785]  You'd probably karate chop Bob in the neck if he was lucky.
[01:21:41.565 --> 01:22:04.264]  But if it's a big ol' giant fat black dude or fat Mexican or fat white guy that looks like a total demon out of some nightmare PCP hallucination shaking that big ol' booty in their face with big ol' giant choppers with a bunch of whacked out leftist women, then it's cute and it's fun.
[01:22:06.806 --> 01:22:08.267]  And these kids don't know what's hit them.
[01:22:08.627 --> 01:22:08.988]  And again,
[01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:12.633]  We keep showing this scary guy.
[01:22:13.354 --> 01:22:16.515]  What about the dude that was the leader of it, the convicted child rapist?
[01:22:16.796 --> 01:22:18.356]  We'll get to him in the video in a minute.
[01:22:20.618 --> 01:22:21.778]  So I'm going to explain this again.
[01:22:22.078 --> 01:22:28.582]  Your children, without you asking in many cases, are served up like an all-you-can-abuse buffet.
[01:22:30.618 --> 01:22:39.880]  All over the country, with the same talk, the same execution, the same weird dude of the most creepy guys you've ever seen in your life.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.081]  That if they did this in a park, they'd be arrested.
[01:22:45.841 --> 01:22:52.863]  But now they're gods put on pedestals by the Associated Press, and by Reuters, and by CNN, and by Good Morning America.
[01:22:52.923 --> 01:22:53.783]  What does that tell you?
[01:22:54.243 --> 01:22:55.323]  It's Hollywood, folks.
[01:22:55.683 --> 01:22:58.324]  This is their venom injected right into your children.
[01:23:00.165 --> 01:23:01.126]  These poor little children.
[01:23:01.146 --> 01:23:03.868]  So I'm going to stop interrupting.
[01:23:03.888 --> 01:23:06.771]  Here's KHOU that tried to cover all this up.
[01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:10.454]  When this came out, oh well, he did something with a kid but wasn't convicted.
[01:23:10.514 --> 01:23:11.355]  No, he was convicted.
[01:23:12.896 --> 01:23:14.057]  They said it was a 14-year-old.
[01:23:14.117 --> 01:23:14.818]  It was an 8-year-old.
[01:23:17.661 --> 01:23:19.182]  And again, we haven't gotten this dude yet.
[01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.684]  Albert Alfonso Garcia, 32.
[01:23:23.755 --> 01:23:28.837]  So let's go ahead now and go to the shocking KHOU piece.
[01:23:29.317 --> 01:23:39.862]  If you're a radio listener, you're lucky because you're not having to see an incredibly scary man with a beard and a dress who weighs at least 400 pounds scaring the hell out of children.
[01:23:39.902 --> 01:23:40.282]  Here it is.
[01:23:41.482 --> 01:23:48.225]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Story Time.
[01:23:48.265 --> 01:23:51.907]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[01:23:52.964 --> 01:23:54.144]  Let's hit pause.
[01:23:54.164 --> 01:23:55.005]  Back it up to the beginning.
[01:23:55.465 --> 01:24:00.126]  Hell, let's take them to the state mental hospital and let them be with serial killers to have acceptance.
[01:24:00.466 --> 01:24:02.807]  Here, let's just take the most insane, crazy people.
[01:24:03.187 --> 01:24:05.347]  By the way, we went and found these folks' YouTube channels.
[01:24:06.148 --> 01:24:07.268]  We can't play this on air.
[01:24:09.108 --> 01:24:11.869]  All they talk about is robbing and stuff and other things.
[01:24:12.349 --> 01:24:12.649]  You know what?
[01:24:12.689 --> 01:24:14.990]  We will play some clips coming up where they talk about
[01:24:17.748 --> 01:24:23.800]  Well actually we have, oh I'm sorry, one of the guys is a convicted murderer who cut his boyfriend up with a saw.
[01:24:25.968 --> 01:24:26.208]  Uh-huh.
[01:24:27.009 --> 01:24:29.651]  And he's on TV with small children talking about how they drug children.
[01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:31.212]  So we'll play all that.
[01:24:31.252 --> 01:24:32.452]  This may take a few more segments.
[01:24:32.472 --> 01:24:32.793]  Sorry.
[01:24:32.813 --> 01:24:35.134]  Because the horror is so incredible.
[01:24:35.394 --> 01:24:37.256]  We've just turned our children over.
[01:24:37.516 --> 01:24:38.456]  Oh, you rape children.
[01:24:38.536 --> 01:24:40.057]  Oh, you kill people with saws.
[01:24:40.518 --> 01:24:41.278]  Where are your parents?
[01:24:41.458 --> 01:24:41.959]  I don't know.
[01:24:42.239 --> 01:24:49.424]  You've just been handed by the school a 10-year-old boy who's on YouTube with you, looking drugged out of his damn mind.
[01:24:51.698 --> 01:24:54.579]  But it's okay because it's liberal.
[01:24:54.979 --> 01:24:56.640]  Here, let's go to KHOU.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:59.280]  Good old Texas, you know, standing up.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:02.401]  And notice he goes, things usually reserve for adults.
[01:25:02.521 --> 01:25:04.982]  It's all like, ha ha ha ha, we got you children.
[01:25:05.202 --> 01:25:05.602]  Here it is.
[01:25:06.683 --> 01:25:13.405]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Story Time.
[01:25:13.465 --> 01:25:16.986]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.316]  Good morning, everybody!
[01:25:20.736 --> 01:25:24.577]  The Heights Library had a special guest for story time.
[01:25:25.058 --> 01:25:25.658]  Oh my goodness.
[01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:27.359]  Everyone is dressed so nice.
[01:25:27.419 --> 01:25:29.359]  I wish I would have worn a nice costume for y'all.
[01:25:29.839 --> 01:25:33.221]  A visitor who usually performs for an older audience.
[01:25:33.821 --> 01:25:34.901]  My name is Blackberry.
[01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:36.542]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[01:25:36.702 --> 01:25:39.203]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[01:25:39.223 --> 01:25:40.563]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[01:25:41.584 --> 01:25:41.744]  No?
[01:25:42.064 --> 01:25:44.025]  This program is geared towards kids.
[01:25:45.544 --> 01:25:46.325]  Licking his lip.
[01:25:46.346 --> 01:25:47.447]  You want to touch me?
[01:25:47.507 --> 01:25:48.789]  You're asking your kid.
[01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:50.732]  Don't worry, they sit on his lap coming up.
[01:25:50.973 --> 01:25:52.756]  And he's not the convicted child rapist.
[01:25:53.437 --> 01:25:54.999]  Or the guy that chopped up his boyfriend.
[01:25:55.139 --> 01:25:55.981]  We're gonna get to them.
[01:25:56.161 --> 01:25:56.822]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:25:56.842 --> 01:25:59.186]  Continue.
[01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:06.951]  I just want to expose them to things they don't get to see every day and want it to become more normal and more accepted.
[01:26:07.351 --> 01:26:08.771]  You know what?
[01:26:08.991 --> 01:26:09.431]  Hit pause.
[01:26:09.551 --> 01:26:09.932]  Back it up.
[01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:12.533]  Take them down to people with black plague coming in TB.
[01:26:12.573 --> 01:26:13.493]  Hell, give them TB.
[01:26:13.813 --> 01:26:15.174]  What the illegal aliens are bringing anyways.
[01:26:15.234 --> 01:26:15.674]  Exactly.
[01:26:16.014 --> 01:26:20.836]  You want to let them experience your children.
[01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:21.776]  It was coming up.
[01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.817]  Meeting with a convicted child rapist.
[01:26:23.997 --> 01:26:26.438]  New experiences you don't get every day, huh?
[01:26:26.478 --> 01:26:27.138]  Let's continue.
[01:26:28.562 --> 01:26:33.091]  Expose them to things I don't get to see every day and want it to become more normal and more accepted.
[01:26:33.111 --> 01:26:37.158]  They've never seen a drive-thru before, so we thought it was a good chance to see one.
[01:26:37.459 --> 01:26:38.260]  Let's turn around.
[01:26:40.001 --> 01:26:40.701]  And shake your butt!
[01:26:40.721 --> 01:26:41.962]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[01:26:42.062 --> 01:26:45.243]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[01:26:45.663 --> 01:26:48.344]  It is amazingly unique and that is... Hit pause again.
[01:26:48.805 --> 01:26:50.225]  It's amazingly unique.
[01:26:50.285 --> 01:26:51.406]  No, it's happening everywhere.
[01:26:52.066 --> 01:26:58.929]  And normally you gotta be in a, you know, high security prison to be able to have a 400 pound black dude, you know, say I'm gonna shake my ass in your face.
[01:26:59.389 --> 01:27:03.851]  But don't worry, you can now go have your children do it or Joe Biden will do it for them as well.
[01:27:04.271 --> 01:27:04.791]  Let's continue.
[01:27:05.663 --> 01:27:06.863]  Strive for, for sure.
[01:27:07.724 --> 01:27:15.867]  We definitely at this particular branch, but also at Houston Public Library, always want to promote diversity, understanding, inclusion, and fun.
[01:27:16.147 --> 01:27:18.628]  Let me hear my cats!
[01:27:20.615 --> 01:27:22.396]  Of course, a love of books, too.
[01:27:22.996 --> 01:27:28.137]  Blackberry says reading is a way to break the stigma of drag in queer culture.
[01:27:28.537 --> 01:27:34.959]  That's the whole goal, is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:41.021]  So once they go into school, later on in life and they see something that's totally different from them, instead of bullying, they're more accepting.
[01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:42.542]  One, two, three.
[01:27:42.782 --> 01:27:43.842]  Stinky cheese.
[01:27:45.043 --> 01:27:46.103]  Stinky cheese.
[01:27:47.383 --> 01:27:50.765]  Warm up to BlackBerry, but that's the whole reason some parents went.
[01:27:51.105 --> 01:27:54.367]  To expose their children to something that they've never seen before.
[01:27:54.427 --> 01:27:57.189]  And most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[01:27:57.449 --> 01:27:58.350]  Stardom Young, right?
[01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:59.991]  Saw a lot of smiles there.
[01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:00.931]  Thanks, Stephanie.
[01:28:01.452 --> 01:28:05.454]  That's like satire from a science fiction movie, where like pedophile aliens take over.
[01:28:05.854 --> 01:28:06.655]  Stardom Young!
[01:28:06.675 --> 01:28:07.575]  Yeah!
[01:28:07.976 --> 01:28:09.176]  The first, the kids are all scared.
[01:28:09.216 --> 01:28:11.398]  After about an hour, they're being normalized.
[01:28:11.818 --> 01:28:14.800]  That's how pedophiles do it, is they test you, they get you used to it.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.201]  And we come back!
[01:28:17.162 --> 01:28:26.565]  We're going to play who was running the operation, the convicted child rapist, and then the convicted person that cut his boyfriend up with a saw with little kids is all part of this.
[01:28:26.905 --> 01:28:28.585]  And this is all just women bringing their kids.
[01:28:28.645 --> 01:28:29.286]  It's beautiful.
[01:28:29.446 --> 01:28:30.366]  But hey, don't worry.
[01:28:30.506 --> 01:28:31.766]  I'll show you the news articles.
[01:28:32.167 --> 01:28:34.207]  And I've got the video where they don't ask you now.
[01:28:34.447 --> 01:28:41.449]  They're coming to your public school and your daughter and son is going to sit on that convicted rapist lap.
[01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:44.150]  They're going to run their fingers through their beard.
[01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:46.611]  In fact, in some of the videos I got,
[01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:49.951]  The men have their genitals out.
[01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:51.112]  It's liberal, though.
[01:28:51.132 --> 01:28:52.893]  It's not... It's totally illegal.
[01:28:53.333 --> 01:28:54.874]  Just like killing babies after they're born.
[01:28:55.274 --> 01:28:57.075]  But you gotta push the envelope, don't you?
[01:28:57.756 --> 01:28:59.237]  Yes, they do.
[01:29:02.819 --> 01:29:04.119]  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes.
[01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:07.640]  There's breaking news right now in a scandal that is engulfing Fox News.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:24.563]  More audio has been unearthed, which we have here exclusively, of one of the channel's primetime hosts using a homophobic slur, also calling the people of Iraq, and I quote here, semi-literate primitive monkeys, for whom he had, quote, zero sympathy, because they, quote, don't use toilet paper or forks.
[01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:26.023]  Listen to what Carlson says.
[01:29:26.263 --> 01:29:28.084]  I love women, but they're extremely primitive.
[01:29:28.104 --> 01:29:28.464]  They're basic.
[01:29:28.504 --> 01:29:30.004]  They're not that hard to understand.
[01:29:30.544 --> 01:29:30.824]  Sure.
[01:29:31.545 --> 01:29:36.308]  Sure, women are primitive in that right now many of them want to throw Tucker Carlson into a volcano.
[01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:44.254]  Did Tucker Carlson say some things on the radio that people might deem offensive or inappropriate?
[01:29:44.674 --> 01:29:45.555]  He absolutely did.
[01:29:47.056 --> 01:29:47.997]  Big whoop.
[01:29:52.672 --> 01:29:54.434]  You know, that's the big thing that gets me about this.
[01:29:54.654 --> 01:29:58.316]  It's like, these people promote the most disgusting crap.
[01:29:58.477 --> 01:30:02.620]  I mean, Slate and all these magazines promote pedophilia.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.601]  It gets promoted on YouTube.
[01:30:04.621 --> 01:30:09.505]  I mean, just look at the disgust that comes out of Hollywood and the entertainment industry.
[01:30:09.525 --> 01:30:10.766]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:30:10.966 --> 01:30:14.789]  California's entertainment culture just gives us total filth.
[01:30:14.869 --> 01:30:20.913]  Fake butts, fake boobs, naked women, porn, violence, death, gore.
[01:30:20.933 --> 01:30:21.774]  I mean, it's all
[01:30:21.854 --> 01:30:23.975]  A lot of people say terrible things.
[01:30:24.015 --> 01:30:25.616]  And by a lot of people, I mean Tucker Carlson.
[01:30:25.636 --> 01:30:26.536]  I feel sorry for unattractive women.
[01:30:26.576 --> 01:30:28.057]  I mean, it's something they did.
[01:30:28.097 --> 01:30:28.777]  He's not apologizing.
[01:30:40.103 --> 01:30:43.284]  And instead of apologizing, what he says is, hey, watch my show.
[01:30:43.364 --> 01:30:47.246]  He says, apologizing to the mob costs people their jobs.
[01:30:47.266 --> 01:30:48.546]  What a coward.
[01:30:48.666 --> 01:30:50.687]  You know the role you're required to play?
[01:30:51.047 --> 01:30:53.969]  You are a sinner begging the forgiveness of Twitter.
[01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:57.130]  So you issue a statement of deep contrition.
[01:30:57.170 --> 01:30:59.591]  You apologize profusely for your transgressions.
[01:30:59.631 --> 01:31:01.992]  You promise to be a better person going forward.
[01:31:03.649 --> 01:31:10.092]  Then you sit back and brace for a wave of stories about your apology, all of which are simply pretexts for attacking you again.
[01:31:10.372 --> 01:31:11.732]  If you mean it, own it.
[01:31:12.072 --> 01:31:14.994]  Don't just protect your money and your fame or infamy in your case.
[01:31:15.034 --> 01:31:17.935]  It's all about getting Tucker Carlson.
[01:31:18.055 --> 01:31:18.455]  Why?
[01:31:19.155 --> 01:31:24.738]  Because he embarrasses their intellectuals every time they go on his television show.
[01:31:25.118 --> 01:31:27.759]  He makes mincemeat out of their
[01:31:28.779 --> 01:31:30.060]  Quote-unquote intellect.
[01:31:30.321 --> 01:31:32.602]  I'm laughing at the superior intellect.
[01:31:33.263 --> 01:31:34.624]  Own that you did something wrong.
[01:31:35.325 --> 01:31:42.290]  People who just say ugly things to get attention and jump up and down on the fault lines in our society, you don't have any of these virtues.
[01:31:42.511 --> 01:31:43.892]  You don't get it yet, do you?
[01:31:44.152 --> 01:31:45.413]  People are sick of you.
[01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:52.199]  And when you try to remove someone off air because they did some racy shock jock interview a decade ago,
[01:31:53.119 --> 01:31:58.722]  People look at you and think you're the one with the problem, not Tucker Carlson.
[01:31:59.182 --> 01:32:03.745]  Why are the people who consider Bill Clinton a hero lecturing me about sexism?
[01:32:03.865 --> 01:32:08.407]  Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[01:32:08.587 --> 01:32:10.208]  How can anybody believe that?
[01:32:10.228 --> 01:32:11.109]  A lot of people believe it.
[01:32:11.129 --> 01:32:17.154]  Look, if there weren't people who really believe it, they wouldn't become rich and get a platform on Fox.
[01:32:17.174 --> 01:32:19.836]  We've always apologized when we're wrong and we'll continue to do that.
[01:32:19.876 --> 01:32:21.317]  That's what decent people do.
[01:32:21.337 --> 01:32:22.158]  They apologize.
[01:32:22.818 --> 01:32:25.040]  But we will never bow to the mob.
[01:32:25.861 --> 01:32:26.081]  Ever.
[01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:27.422]  No matter what.
[01:32:28.914 --> 01:32:29.655]  InfoWars.
[01:32:30.015 --> 01:32:30.916]  Tomorrow's news.

[01:32:46.932 --> 01:32:49.435]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[01:32:49.735 --> 01:32:57.760]  Very, very cool logo and kind of more discreet so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.

[01:33:06.386 --> 01:33:09.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:25.661]  Big Brother.
[01:33:25.681 --> 01:33:26.921]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:27.421 --> 01:33:28.582]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:29.342 --> 01:33:30.822]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:31.062 --> 01:33:32.223]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:32.723 --> 01:33:37.404]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.251 --> 01:33:56.740]  In Houston, a convicted child rapist of an eight-year-old leads operations as part of the international system in Texas.
[01:33:57.821 --> 01:34:03.387]  He attends shows in Austin, you name it, with small children sexualizing them.
[01:34:03.407 --> 01:34:05.209]  He's a convicted child rapist.
[01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:08.633]  And the corporate media is pushing the pedophile takeover.
[01:34:09.884 --> 01:34:17.965]  In the name of obese men, mainly, dressed up as women, as their camouflage, as they attempt to sexualize children.
[01:34:19.266 --> 01:34:31.648]  Now, the first clip I want to play before I get to Albert Alfonso Garza is from a Millie Weaver report up on Infowars.com, but their whole house of cards is coming down.
[01:34:32.548 --> 01:34:34.508]  Is it still illegal to have sex with children?
[01:34:34.949 --> 01:34:36.709]  And many of these monsters have.
[01:34:37.639 --> 01:34:46.922]  This is a report dealing with Desmond is Amazing, the main drag kid they promote everywhere, whose parents rent him out to gay bars to dance for men.
[01:34:47.802 --> 01:34:50.183]  Since he was six or seven years old, he's been a drag queen.
[01:34:50.203 --> 01:34:54.944]  It turns out Child Drag Queen appeared on Notorious Killer's YouTube show
[01:34:55.814 --> 01:35:08.446]  Repeatedly, Michael Ehrlich who launched the whole club kids movement, which means underage boys in clubs with adults having sex with them and men pretending to be babies so pedophiles can have sex with them.
[01:35:08.826 --> 01:35:10.348]  That is their own admission.
[01:35:10.688 --> 01:35:17.194]  So here are these gentlemen on their show where they had this young boy talking about bring your children to us.
[01:35:17.234 --> 01:35:17.635]  Here it is.
[01:35:18.761 --> 01:35:28.966]  And now we've got something to show you, and we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[01:35:29.826 --> 01:35:40.312]  What we're going to show you is going to leave an impression on them, and we hope the impression will be that they grow up, if they're 3 or 4 or 5 years old, to become 7 or 8-year-old drag queens and fall girls.
[01:35:44.154 --> 01:35:46.855]  You have to understand, I have hundreds of clips just as bad.
[01:35:47.135 --> 01:35:59.878]  I have them with Desmond is Amazing, talking with Signs saying we take Rohibinol, and then with another drag queen saying I like to snort Ketamine, which is a drug you take so you can be gang raped.
[01:36:02.099 --> 01:36:03.599]  And you don't feel any pain while it's happening.
[01:36:04.989 --> 01:36:06.590]  So, we've already played this before.
[01:36:07.050 --> 01:36:07.711]  This is incredible.
[01:36:07.751 --> 01:36:11.994]  I've been criticized by mainstream media for saying this is wrong, including Howard Stern.
[01:36:12.674 --> 01:36:15.436]  And I don't think Howard Stern is aware of all this, certainly, or he wouldn't be doing this.
[01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:27.924]  Here is a top drag queen that performs at adult clubs, saying he admits to grooming children at story hour events, and in full videos like an hour long, he says at city council in Louisiana, you will not stop me.
[01:36:27.965 --> 01:36:29.145]  Your children are mine.
[01:36:29.586 --> 01:36:32.307]  I will groom them, which is the pedophile term.
[01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:39.556]  These people, whether this guy's a victim himself or not, because he sounds like he doesn't know what he's saying, they believe in it.
[01:36:39.616 --> 01:36:40.477]  They can't stop.
[01:36:40.537 --> 01:36:41.318]  They can't quit.
[01:36:41.439 --> 01:36:42.280]  It's their passion.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:43.321]  It's who they are.
[01:36:43.401 --> 01:36:44.202]  It's their religion.
[01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:50.670]  Let's go ahead and roll the video.
[01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:50.991]  Here it is.
[01:36:53.151 --> 01:36:54.011]  My name's Dylan Pontiff.
[01:36:54.191 --> 01:36:57.793]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:36:57.993 --> 01:37:01.454]  So, apparently to a lot of people in this room, I'm the big boogeyman.
[01:37:02.094 --> 01:37:06.696]  I am just as talented as a singer or a dancer or anyone that has a special talent.
[01:37:06.756 --> 01:37:09.937]  It's just mine is dressing up as a woman entertaining a crowd.
[01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:16.259]  The eyes that people give you whenever they think that you are the one that's in support of this event is truly disgusting.
[01:37:16.559 --> 01:37:20.080]  But I'm here to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful.
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:25.842]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:37:26.163 --> 01:37:30.764]  We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[01:37:31.244 --> 01:37:34.466]  And just because I said that, you heard the little plore of people behind me.
[01:37:35.026 --> 01:37:35.546]  It's disgusting.
[01:37:36.466 --> 01:37:39.187]  They're going to groom the kids to not run at the playground.
[01:37:39.808 --> 01:37:41.548]  To not run from the white van.
[01:37:41.848 --> 01:37:42.849]  You're going to groom them.
[01:37:43.786 --> 01:37:44.547]  Which is what they do.
[01:37:44.787 --> 01:37:46.068]  I'm not saying this guy's a pedophile.
[01:37:46.108 --> 01:37:46.669]  Oh, surely not.
[01:37:46.689 --> 01:37:52.135]  He goes in and talks about, oh, I perform at gay clubs and I dance naked, but I can control that with your children.
[01:37:52.455 --> 01:37:53.436]  Give me access.
[01:37:53.476 --> 01:37:54.197]  You will.
[01:37:54.637 --> 01:37:55.939]  You cannot make it up.
[01:37:55.959 --> 01:38:01.144]  But America's asleep with a switch, does whatever the left says, so that no one will dare even resist it.
[01:38:02.906 --> 01:38:06.109]  Should we play Desmond and the convicted murderer?
[01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:08.391]  Oh, here's our child.
[01:38:08.411 --> 01:38:09.151]  We don't have jobs.
[01:38:09.191 --> 01:38:10.592]  Our child dances at your bars.
[01:38:10.932 --> 01:38:17.397]  Here's the person that launched this whole movement, who's a convicted murderer, talking about, you know, how great everything is.
[01:38:17.437 --> 01:38:19.398]  And here he is on another show talking about ketamine.
[01:38:20.499 --> 01:38:21.740]  No, we're not going to play those clips.
[01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:24.422]  We've already played those before.
[01:38:25.489 --> 01:38:29.530]  But that's what people are doing because we've advocated our responsibility.
[01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:37.233]  We've turned totally loose to the decadent establishment and their religion that is stealing the energy of children.
[01:38:38.754 --> 01:38:42.135]  Drag Queen Storytime reader once charged with child sex assault.
[01:38:42.555 --> 01:38:42.915]  ABC 13.
[01:38:43.275 --> 01:38:47.257]  No, he was convicted and given 10 years.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:50.700]  They know that!
[01:38:51.441 --> 01:38:53.403]  But every way... They go, oh, it was a 14-year-old.
[01:38:53.443 --> 01:38:54.183]  It was an 8-year-old.
[01:38:54.583 --> 01:38:56.105]  That's the news working.
[01:38:56.365 --> 01:39:00.488]  I mean, you watch that KHOU report, where they're like, it's fun!
[01:39:00.608 --> 01:39:01.649]  Get them all their young!
[01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.989]  Great!
[01:39:02.249 --> 01:39:04.551]  Well, the kids didn't like it, but this will teach them to like it.
[01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:05.031]  It's like a joke.
[01:39:05.352 --> 01:39:08.714]  The kids didn't like a bunch of big fat men rubbing their asses on them.
[01:39:09.055 --> 01:39:09.735]  Ha ha ha!
[01:39:10.015 --> 01:39:12.237]  Well, they'll certainly learn to like it later!
[01:39:12.297 --> 01:39:13.238]  Get them all their young!
[01:39:13.498 --> 01:39:14.919]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.502]  No, you're not on five hits of acid, folks.
[01:39:18.722 --> 01:39:19.783]  This is happening.
[01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.502]  And that's why they want us off the air.
[01:39:22.522 --> 01:39:24.103]  Oh, here it is.
[01:39:24.203 --> 01:39:25.263]  Drag Queen Story Time.
[01:39:25.283 --> 01:39:25.984]  Document Cam Shot.
[01:39:26.004 --> 01:39:26.744]  Please for TV viewers.
[01:39:28.185 --> 01:39:29.265]  Saturday, September 30th.
[01:39:29.325 --> 01:39:30.266]  It's just last year.
[01:39:30.286 --> 01:39:32.367]  1 to 1.45 p.m.
[01:39:32.507 --> 01:39:34.528]  Break out the dress-up chest.
[01:39:35.308 --> 01:39:37.229]  Let your imagination run wild.
[01:39:37.309 --> 01:39:43.072]  Featuring Blackberry and Tantia Malyanina, which means bad girl.
[01:39:43.613 --> 01:39:45.654]  And boy, bad girl's a bad girl.
[01:39:45.714 --> 01:39:49.836]  Bad girl raped an eight-year-old boy until he bled everywhere.
[01:39:51.237 --> 01:39:59.122]  Man has been in the pen, but now your children are sitting on their lap and running their fingers through that hair.
[01:39:59.142 --> 01:40:02.664]  I'm gonna play the clip, they're like, run your fingers through my hair.
[01:40:02.684 --> 01:40:03.945]  I'm gonna play it for you again.
[01:40:04.925 --> 01:40:06.166]  You can't make it up.
[01:40:06.546 --> 01:40:08.588]  Your acquiescence has allowed this.
[01:40:10.143 --> 01:40:11.304]  Hundreds of truck attacks.
[01:40:11.404 --> 01:40:12.444]  Thousands of stabbings.
[01:40:12.764 --> 01:40:13.705]  Hundreds of shootings.
[01:40:13.985 --> 01:40:16.346]  Hundreds of thousands of dead Christians.
[01:40:16.606 --> 01:40:20.828]  1,300 churches blown up from Europe to the Middle East to Asia by Muslims.
[01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:21.788]  No coverage!
[01:40:22.548 --> 01:40:25.109]  One mosque gets shot up into the world.
[01:40:25.469 --> 01:40:26.730]  Every Christian's to blame.
[01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:27.830]  Trump's to blame.
[01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:29.651]  Total coverage everywhere.
[01:40:32.753 --> 01:40:35.594]  Oh look, there's BlackBerry.
[01:40:36.854 --> 01:40:38.395]  And then there's the convicted.
[01:40:40.182 --> 01:40:40.940]  Child rapists!
[01:40:43.383 --> 01:40:51.625]  Here, let's play some of the video off the YouTube channel of this person, where he's putting on makeup with his friend, and they're talking about scams and other weird stuff.
[01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:54.245]  Putting on their disguises before they go out.
[01:40:54.645 --> 01:40:57.366]  Hey, kids are scared of men, big fat men, they should be.
[01:40:57.686 --> 01:41:01.026]  Let's dress up like demon clown women, and let's go.
[01:41:01.046 --> 01:41:02.407]  Here they are, let's play some audio.
[01:41:02.427 --> 01:41:03.667]  Here they are, putting the disguises on.
[01:41:03.687 --> 01:41:09.388]  And, you know, that's how she got her fan base on Queens of the Weekend, where they wanted her to stay.
[01:41:09.408 --> 01:41:09.928]  Keep going.
[01:41:09.948 --> 01:41:10.468]  Keep going.
[01:41:11.975 --> 01:41:17.177]  So, that's why, you know, I wanted her a part of it.
[01:41:19.058 --> 01:41:26.602]  Agune, um, she's not doing drag right now, so, and she misses it, so the only drag she was doing is when she did videos.
[01:41:27.362 --> 01:41:28.182]  So she loves it.
[01:41:28.663 --> 01:41:29.823]  Yeah, she's very talented.
[01:41:30.163 --> 01:41:33.265]  And then, um, this crime scene,
[01:41:34.577 --> 01:41:36.417]  Was like uber excited about it.
[01:41:36.437 --> 01:41:40.318]  She wanted us to have merchandise and thinking towards the future.
[01:41:40.338 --> 01:41:41.198]  I was like, yes, ma'am.
[01:41:41.798 --> 01:41:42.638]  See, that's what I thought.
[01:41:42.738 --> 01:41:45.159]  I was thinking way out of the future from our channel, too.
[01:41:45.179 --> 01:41:47.939]  But we could never get a cast of girls that was serious.
[01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:51.280]  And it's hard.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.220]  It's hard to understand.
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:56.701]  You've got a captive audience of two and three year olds that'll sit on your lap.
[01:41:56.721 --> 01:42:03.362]  And it doesn't matter if the person in the blue wife beater raped an eight year old boy.
[01:42:04.588 --> 01:42:06.009]  That was love, according to Nambla.
[01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:09.070]  We're going to go to break and come back with the other big news that I haven't hit yet.
[01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:14.833]  And Beto O'Rourke and his pathetic flopping around like a fish out of water.
[01:42:15.713 --> 01:42:16.533]  It's back in the news.
[01:42:16.593 --> 01:42:17.414]  I didn't cover this.
[01:42:17.574 --> 01:42:23.156]  It's, oh boy, Barack Obama's brother asking if Michelle is Michael Obama.
[01:42:24.057 --> 01:42:25.397]  They say I'm the person that said that.
[01:42:25.437 --> 01:42:28.378]  No, it was Joan Rivers right before she was murdered or died.
[01:42:29.299 --> 01:42:30.279]  That's all coming up.
[01:42:30.679 --> 01:42:32.800]  And then we've also got this big report I didn't get to.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.681]  I'll make it to it tomorrow.
[01:42:34.201 --> 01:42:38.183]  A lot of work went into this, but the militarization, the radicalization of young people.
[01:42:38.563 --> 01:42:47.267]  Please don't forget, free shipping, store-wide, new big mega sale, and 50% off all the supplements, a bunch of other big deals, double Patriot points, and free shipping.
[01:42:48.208 --> 01:42:51.049]  Anytime you sign up for auto-ship of the next order, it's free to cancel.
[01:42:51.349 --> 01:42:52.490]  Whatever you do, fund us.
[01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:57.973]  We are actually doing a lot of covert operations that are legal and lawful against the pedo rings.
[01:42:58.233 --> 01:43:00.334]  So your money's well spent at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:02.765 --> 01:43:06.646]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[01:43:07.407 --> 01:43:11.228]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:43:11.648 --> 01:43:18.671]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:43:19.591 --> 01:43:21.812]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:43:22.712 --> 01:43:26.194]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:43:27.525 --> 01:43:30.486]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:32.207]  We are the power structure.
[01:43:32.707 --> 01:43:33.728]  We are the inventors.
[01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:35.368]  We are the trailblazers.
[01:43:36.088 --> 01:43:38.889]  And the globalists understand that.
[01:43:39.490 --> 01:43:45.452]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[01:43:46.592 --> 01:43:50.414]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[01:43:51.434 --> 01:44:00.425]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at Inforestore.com.
[01:44:00.565 --> 01:44:01.927]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[01:44:03.104 --> 01:44:06.125]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[01:44:06.465 --> 01:44:12.387]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[01:44:12.807 --> 01:44:18.688]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[01:44:18.988 --> 01:44:21.629]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[01:44:21.909 --> 01:44:29.413]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[01:44:29.433 --> 01:44:37.638]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:42.501]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:46.992]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[01:44:47.172 --> 01:44:53.154]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[01:44:54.114 --> 01:45:02.976]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[01:45:03.516 --> 01:45:07.697]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[01:45:07.717 --> 01:45:09.478]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[01:45:10.558 --> 01:45:12.386]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:13.692]  It was the last run.
[01:45:13.712 --> 01:45:14.677]  It's been sold out for two months.
[01:45:15.745 --> 01:45:16.605]  How is X2 back?
[01:45:17.106 --> 01:45:20.708]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[01:45:21.168 --> 01:45:24.250]  We got put over the barrels, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[01:45:24.850 --> 01:45:34.896]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[01:45:34.956 --> 01:45:38.878]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[01:45:39.318 --> 01:45:40.419]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[01:45:40.859 --> 01:45:45.221]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[01:45:45.661 --> 01:45:47.462]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[01:45:47.882 --> 01:45:49.182]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[01:45:49.703 --> 01:45:51.964]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[01:45:52.444 --> 01:45:54.785]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[01:45:55.385 --> 01:45:58.886]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[01:45:59.727 --> 01:46:02.208]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:05.553]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[01:46:06.013 --> 01:46:18.381]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[01:46:18.882 --> 01:46:21.263]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[01:46:21.944 --> 01:46:23.084]  So iodine is amazing.
[01:46:23.124 --> 01:46:23.705]  It's important.
[01:46:23.725 --> 01:46:25.966]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[01:46:26.026 --> 01:46:26.547]  They'll hurt you.
[01:46:26.927 --> 01:46:27.607]  This is pure.
[01:46:27.888 --> 01:46:28.588]  This is clean.
[01:46:28.928 --> 01:46:29.709]  This is amazing.
[01:46:30.049 --> 01:46:31.850]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[01:46:33.371 --> 01:46:37.013]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[01:46:37.313 --> 01:46:42.076]  X2 Original, from the very first original manufacturer.
[01:46:42.476 --> 01:46:48.999]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsTore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:49.039 --> 01:46:52.001]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[01:46:52.281 --> 01:47:01.065]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:47:01.085 --> 01:47:02.066]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:47:06.348 --> 01:47:09.069]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.293 --> 01:47:25.917]  All right, I wish I had five more hours, because I got a lot to cover and a lot to say.
[01:47:26.177 --> 01:47:27.817]  The good news is I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:47:27.857 --> 01:47:28.258]  Central.
[01:47:29.178 --> 01:47:30.198]  David Nice on at 8 a.m.
[01:47:30.218 --> 01:47:33.320]  with The David Nice Show and polewars.com for its last show.
[01:47:34.411 --> 01:47:38.117]  We're gonna get to Peto, I'm sorry, Beto O'Rourke here in a minute.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.386]  And his floundering around just as bad as AOC.
[01:47:44.869 --> 01:47:48.535]  But before we go there, I want to finish up what I was talking about earlier.
[01:47:52.039 --> 01:47:57.764]  When we were playing these local newscasts, going, oh, the children are experiencing something that normally only adults would see.
[01:47:58.204 --> 01:48:00.426]  They're experiencing things that, you know, are out of the ordinary.
[01:48:00.927 --> 01:48:07.392]  Big, fat men that are convicted rapists of children, shaking their butts in your children's face and having them sit in your lap.
[01:48:07.772 --> 01:48:10.375]  Like this individual, if you're a TV viewer, you can see him.
[01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:15.699]  Tatina Malianina, that's the fake name of the bad girl.
[01:48:17.501 --> 01:48:18.682]  How about an ISIS beheading?
[01:48:20.216 --> 01:48:22.918]  How about something kids don't normally see when they're four years old?
[01:48:22.938 --> 01:48:27.180]  Let's take them and watch somebody die of cancer in a hospital bed.
[01:48:29.582 --> 01:48:35.746]  It's so sick how they've used our openness and this culture for this type of abuse, and it's just out of control.
[01:48:35.766 --> 01:48:41.410]  But they've got a bunch of followers in this country, and a bunch of jellyfish, and they tell them to do it, so they do it.
[01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.950]  Here's the deal.
[01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:47.574]  The public, ourselves, we're going to go run your plates legally and lawfully.
[01:48:48.422 --> 01:48:49.743]  And we're going to do a little bit more than that.
[01:48:50.603 --> 01:48:57.508]  And then if the police don't arrest you when you're supposed to stay away from kids, we're going to make it public.
[01:48:58.449 --> 01:49:00.290]  And that'll just make them come after us even more.
[01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.830]  Exactly.
[01:49:01.191 --> 01:49:04.373]  Whatever makes the system come after me, I cover that.
[01:49:04.493 --> 01:49:06.334]  And the pedophilia is what they protect.
[01:49:06.794 --> 01:49:08.435]  So remember that about mainstream media.
[01:49:08.756 --> 01:49:09.676]  Remember that about Hollywood.
[01:49:09.696 --> 01:49:15.900]  They just rehired the Guardians of the Galaxy guy that says he loves pedophilia, loves having sex with kids, loves all these pedophile directors.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:16.921]  And they're just like, you know what?
[01:49:16.941 --> 01:49:17.662]  You keep doing that.
[01:49:17.702 --> 01:49:18.122]  We love you.
[01:49:19.815 --> 01:49:20.556]  It's who they are.
[01:49:21.957 --> 01:49:22.557]  It's a cult.
[01:49:23.818 --> 01:49:25.360]  And the sooner we wake up to it, the better.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:26.341]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:49:32.826 --> 01:49:37.810]  Peto O'Rourke is a total fake.
[01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:39.092]  He says he's against rich people.
[01:49:39.632 --> 01:49:40.933]  His wife's worth a billion dollars.
[01:49:41.413 --> 01:49:42.474]  He comes from a rich family.
[01:49:42.775 --> 01:49:44.616]  His father-in-law's worth $27 billion.
[01:49:44.836 --> 01:49:45.977]  And a big globalist.
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:51.863]  He poses in all these photos like he's pulling his pants up and he's out in Big Bend.
[01:49:52.463 --> 01:49:54.305]  And he's like this messiah from the desert.
[01:49:54.365 --> 01:49:55.826]  And I said that when I first saw the cover.
[01:49:56.246 --> 01:49:59.008]  Then he opened it up and he says, I was born to run.
[01:49:59.188 --> 01:50:00.309]  I am your leader.
[01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:06.173]  He does his fake talk like this, like Bernie Sanders and Obama.
[01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:08.735]  I'll tell you, health care will be free.
[01:50:09.595 --> 01:50:10.556]  School will be free.
[01:50:11.548 --> 01:50:15.051]  Everything will be free, like the cross between Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders.
[01:50:15.972 --> 01:50:22.858]  Nothing against folks that aren't from Texas, but my God, this boy's got a New Haven, Connecticut accent.
[01:50:24.159 --> 01:50:24.999]  And that's where he's from.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:32.626]  But he'll come down here, that lovely little carpetbagger, and he'll teach us dumbass Texans how to operate.
[01:50:34.005 --> 01:50:40.253]  But his real danger is, he did get a bunch of Democrats elected and almost turned the state blue, getting a bunch of moron young people behind him.
[01:50:40.874 --> 01:50:45.639]  So all you Texans sitting on your laurels thinking, Texas is red to the end of the world!
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.521]  You're an idiot!
[01:50:48.163 --> 01:50:48.843]  And you're wrong!
[01:50:49.164 --> 01:50:49.805]  So wake up!
[01:50:49.825 --> 01:50:52.468]  Because Beto is cancer.
[01:50:55.845 --> 01:51:02.634]  They're running the caravans, they're running the crime, they're not getting busted like AOC with their illegal campaign money, millions of it stolen.
[01:51:02.654 --> 01:51:04.556]  The Justice Department loves that!
[01:51:04.756 --> 01:51:06.018]  They love scum like this!
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.563]  But he said something human, a compliment he said.
[01:51:10.871 --> 01:51:14.152]  My wife raised our three children almost without me.
[01:51:14.492 --> 01:51:15.093]  She's amazing.
[01:51:15.353 --> 01:51:18.574]  They go, a woman with children like a children are important?
[01:51:18.954 --> 01:51:22.015]  They're good for body parts or for big fat men to have sex with.
[01:51:22.916 --> 01:51:23.936]  But they're toilet paper.
[01:51:25.137 --> 01:51:26.077]  I apologize.
[01:51:26.117 --> 01:51:27.818]  It's not good to take care of kids.
[01:51:27.838 --> 01:51:28.338]  You're right.
[01:51:29.779 --> 01:51:30.879]  And I have white privilege.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.721]  He's the Messiah.
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:43.444]  Couldn't even get re-elected as a state rep, but he's a good guy you can trust out there, boy.
[01:51:43.484 --> 01:51:45.445]  He puts his hands on his booty.
[01:51:46.806 --> 01:51:58.618]  He pulls up his pants like Ronald Reagan, so you know, Bito, that blue shirt, why, he's a regular guy you can trust and bet your last dollar on, my friend.
[01:51:59.459 --> 01:52:05.785]  How long's it been since you got a big ol' steamin' bowl of Pito O'Rourke BS?
[01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.108]  Well, that's too long there.
[01:52:08.148 --> 01:52:09.890]  You need a little bit more of that, don't ya?
[01:52:20.762 --> 01:52:23.324]  But he wants to champion John F. Kennedy's spirit.
[01:52:24.886 --> 01:52:25.326]  How beautiful.
[01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:31.992]  Now let's shift gears to the next subject.
[01:52:34.394 --> 01:52:35.855]  And yes, this is red meat.
[01:52:36.936 --> 01:52:38.557]  But I'm not the one that ever said it.
[01:52:40.038 --> 01:52:46.164]  Michelle Obama is built like an NFL linebacker.
[01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:50.591]  And then you read in Obama's own memoir that he didn't have one, but two.
[01:52:51.652 --> 01:52:53.592]  Transsexual, that's the new proper term.
[01:52:53.632 --> 01:52:54.393]  He said tranny.
[01:52:59.095 --> 01:53:00.175]  Nannies when he was a kid.
[01:53:01.635 --> 01:53:03.556]  And I don't hate anybody as long as they're adult and what they want.
[01:53:03.596 --> 01:53:09.138]  But, you know, she comes out of different videos looking like she's got a roll of quarters in her pants or half dollars.
[01:53:10.159 --> 01:53:12.179]  And she's got shoulders, you know, wider than mine.
[01:53:12.199 --> 01:53:13.480]  And I got wide shoulders, folks.
[01:53:17.032 --> 01:53:24.719]  And it was Joan Rivers, right before she died, the private clinic, they said fire shot out of her throat.
[01:53:24.739 --> 01:53:27.781]  They like dumped gas down her throat reportedly.
[01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:30.123]  Fire shot out, like puffed magic dragon.
[01:53:30.424 --> 01:53:33.766]  She's from private clinic getting some stuff done, like fire shooting out.
[01:53:34.147 --> 01:53:34.587]  She's dead.
[01:53:35.328 --> 01:53:37.209]  She says, no, we already have a tranny.
[01:53:39.691 --> 01:53:41.253]  First lady, she's a tranny.
[01:53:43.348 --> 01:53:46.615]  And then when I reported that, they didn't talk about Joan Rivers, they said I said it.
[01:53:47.517 --> 01:53:49.461]  Here's the article out of TheAmericanMirror.com.
[01:53:49.581 --> 01:53:50.122]  Oh boy!
[01:53:50.142 --> 01:53:54.531]  Barack Obama's brother asked if Michelle is Michael.
[01:53:56.087 --> 01:54:02.011]  Barack Obama's half-brother, Malik, took on to Twitter Thursday to ask if Michelle is actually Michael.
[01:54:02.551 --> 01:54:04.412]  Is Michael, Michelle really Michael?
[01:54:04.932 --> 01:54:08.815]  Obama asked, referring to the conspiracy theory that the former First Lady is actually a man.
[01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:11.296]  Hey, I forgot to tell you guys to get this, see if you can find it.
[01:54:11.937 --> 01:54:14.018]  Obama refers to Michelle as Michael.
[01:54:14.278 --> 01:54:16.039]  Not once, not twice, not three times.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.542]  There are five videos where he goes, my wife, Michael.
[01:54:21.863 --> 01:54:23.284]  What the hell?
[01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:34.872]  So, they go on to say the Independent reported that Alex Jones first reported it in 2017.
[01:54:34.912 --> 01:54:43.918]  The 12-minute video, the Infowars host analysis footage and photos, which he believes proves Michelle Obama has a tally-whacker.
[01:54:44.959 --> 01:54:49.582]  No, I was covering what Joan Rivers said.
[01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:54.024]  Let's play what Joan Rivers had to say right before her death.
[01:54:54.065 --> 01:54:54.545]  Here it is.
[01:54:56.686 --> 01:54:57.527]  Miss Rivers, how are you?
[01:54:58.736 --> 01:55:01.839]  You made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[01:55:01.919 --> 01:55:04.662]  Is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[01:55:04.682 --> 01:55:05.703]  I am so excited.
[01:55:06.043 --> 01:55:08.305]  And I should do very well because I don't charge.
[01:55:08.465 --> 01:55:12.709]  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[01:55:12.729 --> 01:55:14.050]  We already have it with Obama.
[01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:16.532]  So let's just calm down.
[01:55:16.652 --> 01:55:16.913]  Got it.
[01:55:18.014 --> 01:55:21.156]  You know Michelle is a tramp.
[01:55:21.537 --> 01:55:22.397]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:24.676]  A transgender.
[01:55:24.897 --> 01:55:25.677]  We all know.
[01:55:25.797 --> 01:55:26.377]  Oh my gosh.
[01:55:26.517 --> 01:55:28.878]  Oh gosh.
[01:55:29.478 --> 01:55:31.219]  It's okay.
[01:55:31.279 --> 01:55:33.960]  She doesn't want to die.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:37.161]  Okay, so she died after that.
[01:55:37.601 --> 01:55:42.242]  But then they never, they never say that I was reporting on her.
[01:55:42.823 --> 01:55:46.364]  The headline is, Joan Rivers says Michelle Obama is a tranny.
[01:55:48.519 --> 01:55:52.403]  And then there's videos of her where she's not adjusting clothing.
[01:55:52.463 --> 01:56:02.795]  I mean, either she's put a cucumber in her pants that she's adjusting, like Spinal Tap, or she's packing heavy artillery.
[01:56:05.138 --> 01:56:09.242]  But the reason I get into this is the globalists are obsessed with this.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:12.884]  They're obsessed with turning men into women, women into men.
[01:56:13.385 --> 01:56:14.066]  It's their religion.
[01:56:14.086 --> 01:56:17.070]  So then you realize why this whole thing's being pushed.
[01:56:17.872 --> 01:56:19.154]  Why this whole thing's being done.
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:23.981]  Michelle Obama.
[01:56:26.772 --> 01:56:30.914]  Looks like a man, and Obama's brother is saying he thinks she's a man.
[01:56:31.575 --> 01:56:37.718]  And all I'm saying is, when I say that the birth certificate's fake, they put it out in six layers.
[01:56:38.078 --> 01:56:39.679]  It doesn't mean he wasn't born in Kenya.
[01:56:40.119 --> 01:56:41.220]  We know he was born in Hawaii.
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:42.880]  We even know who his real dad was.
[01:56:43.381 --> 01:56:49.464]  The point is they put out fake stuff on purpose, and then they flaunt Michelle Obama, who's got wider shoulders than Obama.
[01:56:50.124 --> 01:56:52.445]  Put that back up for TV viewers.
[01:56:52.605 --> 01:56:53.086]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:56:55.885 --> 01:56:58.067]  She's built like a brick you-know-what house.
[01:56:59.488 --> 01:57:00.970]  She's ready for the NFL.
[01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:04.713]  I mean, look at... There she is with three other women.
[01:57:04.994 --> 01:57:05.654]  Is that a woman?
[01:57:08.317 --> 01:57:08.557]  No!
[01:57:08.577 --> 01:57:12.360]  Hell, I expect to see her at drag time.
[01:57:13.201 --> 01:57:14.402]  Story time with the kids.
[01:57:15.396 --> 01:57:23.225]  It's just incredible when you realize these people are obsessed with what sex they are, and sex is total mental illness.
[01:57:23.725 --> 01:57:24.827]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:57:24.847 --> 01:57:25.167]  Central.
[01:57:25.187 --> 01:57:26.168]  Lord willing, please pray for us.
[01:57:26.188 --> 01:57:26.749]  We need your support.

[01:57:46.888 --> 01:57:48.489]  Whatever you do, spread the word.
[01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:50.030]  You are unstoppable.
[01:57:53.053 --> 01:57:56.136]  In previous revolutions, some good, some bad,
[01:57:58.211 --> 01:58:08.839]  The revolutionaries funded themselves by robbing stagecoaches full of gold or robbing trains full of silver or basically going through the countryside and pillaging.
[01:58:09.819 --> 01:58:14.322]  Well, we've been blessed in the 21st century in this great free market system that we've got.
[01:58:16.064 --> 01:58:23.429]  To be able to just use the free market and high quality products and the rules of commerce to go out and get great products
[01:58:24.893 --> 01:58:32.038]  That people get great results from and then discount those products to you so that it becomes the total 360 win.
[01:58:32.639 --> 01:58:38.143]  And I obsess over that term that I coined years ago because that's really what I believe in.
[01:58:38.203 --> 01:58:42.786]  It's a non-zero-sum game where everybody basically benefits.
[01:58:42.846 --> 01:58:47.990]  It's beyond just symbiotic where everybody kind of works with each other and everybody makes it.
[01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:50.752]  This is where we have an even better future together.
[01:58:51.993 --> 01:58:53.234]  And so we're not robbing banks here.
[01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:57.099]  We're not engaged in criminal activity to fund our operations.
[01:58:58.484 --> 01:58:59.749]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are...
