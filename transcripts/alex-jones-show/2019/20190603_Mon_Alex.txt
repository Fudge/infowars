[00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.927]  It's Monday, June 3rd, 2019.
[00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:27.669]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:41.778]  Get strapped in for the next four hours because this broadcast continues to make history thanks to this great crew, our talk show host, our analyst, and you, the audience, who are in the arena big time.
[00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:42.798]  We salute you all.
[00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.202]  Well, constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, who's helping prepare lawsuits for us,
[00:00:49.287 --> 00:01:06.717]  Class action lawsuits and more against big tech and others that have been engaged in fascist oligopoly coordination, tortious interference to also defame us and basically bankrupt us as a political punishment.
[00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:14.062]  He's going to be in studio hosting again today with us in the second hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:14.662 --> 00:01:17.164]  And we're going to get him scheduled as well on
[00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.966]  David Knight's program that comes on weekday mornings at 8 a.m.
[00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.548]  He'll be on with David tomorrow.
[00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:26.490]  So that's set up, I think, in the third hour.
[00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.651]  So it'll be 10 a.m.
[00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:28.032]  tomorrow.
[00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:31.594]  That said, we also have several big guests today.
[00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:36.017]  We have the Great Awakening, QAnon,
[00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:52.463]  I thought I'd have the best-selling author of this on, because I've had mixed feelings about the whole QAnon phenomenon, and I haven't had a lot of time to follow it, but I'll tune in to a YouTube video somebody texts me or whatever, and it's like,
[00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:55.127]  I used to like Alex Jones.
[00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:58.128]  Now I know he's a globalist agent.
[00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:02.449]  I'm with Trump and I'm with Q. And you know, just weird stuff like that.
[00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:13.731]  And there's clearly people out there, even if Q was ever real or whatever it is, that are attacking some of Trump's most key supporters by claiming that they magically are under Trump's command.
[00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:15.532]  I talked to the president.
[00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.332]  My guests talked to the president.
[00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:23.401]  I go and write detailed reports directly to the President, at the President's request.
[00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:29.343]  The White House calls here and asks, what are the best videos of yours for us to tweet?
[00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:40.768]  I'm on record talking to the President, and it's disgusting to have shadowy people, I don't even know their names, telling you that the show and the broadcast that the enemy recognizes
[00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:45.784]  Was instrumental in getting President Trump in that we're somehow the bad guys.
[00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.487]  If that isn't a big, fat, globalist PSYOP, I don't know what is.
[00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.190]  And it's disgusting.
[00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.336]  Now, this individual, I meant to read the book, I haven't yet, and I don't really know if he's attacked me or not.
[00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:03.239]  The producer says he seems like a pretty well-spoken, nice fellow.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.023]  I want to make friends with whatever Q is, but I'm going to explain something.
[00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:10.365]  I used to get calls
[00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:18.468]  Back when the anonymous movement was really getting started, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago, whenever it started, about 8, 9 years ago.
[00:03:19.168 --> 00:03:19.628]  Look that up.
[00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:21.169]  When did anonymous phenomenon pop up?
[00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:28.171]  And I get calls from listeners, I'd be asked on the street, and I would get all sorts of questions like, do you support anonymous?
[00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:31.013]  That's like saying, do I support the ocean?
[00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:32.413]  Yeah, I like the ocean.
[00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.034]  You can also drown in it.
[00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:38.287]  Anybody can be anonymous, anybody can put on a Guy Fawkes mask.
[00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:41.069]  So 2003, wow, around a lot longer than that.
[00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.230]  So it's been around 15, 16 years.
[00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.452]  I guess it got big like 10 years ago.
[00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:47.993]  So do you support anonymous?
[00:03:48.013 --> 00:03:50.755]  What, anybody and everybody putting a mask on?
[00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:56.259]  And then just saying that they're this big powerful anonymous thing and they speak for legions?
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.823]  That's got more credibility in my book than people putting out codes and
[00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:08.191]  Religious statements and fortune cookie type stuff and little fables and Easter egg hunch.
[00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:14.615]  Looking for pots of gold in the Klondike's or the treasure of the Sierra Madres.
[00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:22.919]  When right there is the real fight against the globalists open in your face ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.401]  So that's the bottom line and
[00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:29.872]  It's just amazing.
[00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:34.435]  I can have former top CIA people on that are openly have the support of Trump.
[00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:36.317]  They'll say the most bombshell stuff.
[00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:37.517]  No one even cares.
[00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:45.382]  But you go on 4chan and you say, I looked in the toilet this morning and on the way the turds were floating around, I saw a secret message from the president.
[00:04:45.963 --> 00:04:51.066]  It is taken like, you know, people seeing the Virgin Mary and their toast or something.
[00:04:51.346 --> 00:04:52.067]  So that's fine.
[00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:55.129]  We're going to get to the bottom of it in the third hour.
[00:04:56.932 --> 00:04:57.472]  Unbelievable.
[00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:57.912]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:58.752]  NewsWars.com.
[00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:07.314]  Sometimes grown-ups touch kids in ways they don't like.
[00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:10.395]  I was wrestling with my uncle, and it changed.
[00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:11.615]  It felt icky.
[00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:15.056]  When touching feels funny, it's hard to know what to do.
[00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:17.456]  He said I shouldn't tell anyone.
[00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:20.357]  If that ever happens to you, say no.
[00:05:20.837 --> 00:05:21.077]  No!
[00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:21.997]  Then go!
[00:05:22.317 --> 00:05:22.637]  Go!
[00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:24.438]  And tell someone you trust.
[00:05:25.018 --> 00:05:25.338]  Tell!
[00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.298]  Say no!
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.140]  Bingo!
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.401]  And count!
[00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:32.362]  A message from the American Medical Association.
[00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:34.242]  I'll bet you're as bright as you're good-looking.
[00:05:34.523 --> 00:05:34.963]  I tell you.
[00:05:34.983 --> 00:05:35.323]  I tell you what.
[00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:36.083]  What's your favorite subject?
[00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:38.464]  Journalism.
[00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:39.204]  Journalism?
[00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:39.804]  Whoa!
[00:05:40.805 --> 00:05:41.125]  Whoa!
[00:05:41.145 --> 00:05:42.726]  I better be more circumspect in my answers.
[00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:43.386]  Those guys back there.
[00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:45.887]  Go ahead to the next question.
[00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:54.520]  And by the way, that's one of the things that's a dangerous idea.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.182]  You know, as these guys will tell you, I'm not always their favorite subject.
[00:05:57.402 --> 00:06:01.665]  But the truth of the matter is, the reason we are who we are is called a Free Press Continued Incentive.
[00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:11.572]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.682 --> 00:06:34.264]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.845 --> 00:06:42.206]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.881]  We have one of the spokespersons for the foggy unknown.
[00:06:50.407 --> 00:06:55.769]  Leprechaun-esque Q movement joining us in the third hour should be interesting.
[00:06:55.809 --> 00:07:18.295]  We have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, who's again been here in Austin off and on the last few months, preparing the strategies to defend the First Amendment and the right to buy and sell and the right to commerce and more against the big tech giants and preparing for the antitrust criminal investigations, not just regulatory investigations, that will be launching in July.
[00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:20.456]  Last time I was told.
[00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:27.743]  Kind of like I told you in 2018, they'd released the Mueller Report in March of 2019.
[00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:36.311]  That's how far out the globalists were scripting what they were doing, and we had intel on it that was incredibly accurate.
[00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:38.292]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:51.405]  President Trump is planning, symbolically, as of now, as of people that have been in the room, to launch the antitrust salvos and more in or around July 4th, 2019.
[00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:56.429]  So this is a big deal.
[00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:58.551]  And again, we told you this was coming.
[00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:12.904]  Weeks ago, months ago, specifically, when I went to DC, and now the Wall Street Journal has reported, and of course the White House has confirmed, they are preparing major antitrust action.
[00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:18.148]  Not just against Google, but against others.
[00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:20.610]  Others, like Facebook.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.962]  Why do you think Twitter has been there?
[00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:30.007]  And so a lot is coming, a lot is unfolding, and the White House is gathering intel and data.
[00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:33.550]  Bloomberg, of course, reported Google should be afraid, very afraid.
[00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:36.573]  We're going to get into that in detail today.
[00:08:37.554 --> 00:08:45.561]  And we are also going to get into the President and First Lady shining over in the UK.
[00:08:46.803 --> 00:08:55.245]  We are also going to look at the collapsed border, which the Democrats now admit has collapsed, but they're blaming Trump.
[00:08:56.985 --> 00:09:02.446]  And we also have the Mexican president saying that the U.S.
[00:09:02.486 --> 00:09:03.926]  is basically Mexico's enemy.
[00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:08.667]  And then you have the Mexican envoy who's in charge of the immigration talks in D.C.
[00:09:09.548 --> 00:09:11.748]  saying that President Trump
[00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:20.844]  is an enemy of Mexico and that Mexico is at war with the United States.
[00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:25.105]  Mexico is a collapse-filled state.
[00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:26.106]  I'm very sorry to say that.
[00:09:26.146 --> 00:09:31.227]  It's got a lot of cool people, a lot of nice things, a lot of great art, a lot of interesting innovation.
[00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:33.168]  I mean, the Mexicans are interesting people.
[00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:39.470]  But their country is a hellish police state and has collapsed in many areas.
[00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:56.985]  They are weaponizing third world populations and getting payment from coyotes now, smugglers that are bringing them in, including hundreds of Africans at a time coming across into Texas over the Rio Grande.
[00:10:01.323 --> 00:10:01.843]  Unbelievable.
[00:10:01.944 --> 00:10:11.850]  And many times up to 30% of the children with them, whether they be African, whether they be from Mexico, are kidnapped as the passage into the country and as the anchor baby.
[00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:19.196]  But the problem is, is that the government's doing genetic testing and 30% are not related.
[00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.597]  Yes, these are kidnapped children.
[00:10:21.617 --> 00:10:25.800]  And remember, Obama started this entire practice.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.703]  That is all coming up here today.
[00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:35.737]  Now, when we come back, John Bowne's had a very important report.
[00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:41.359]  Antitrust suits threaten technocratic domination.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.762]  That's just suits that the Supreme Court's already ruled in favor of against Apple.
[00:10:48.843 --> 00:10:51.644]  And so we've got a lot of different angles to all of this.
[00:10:52.602 --> 00:11:04.990]  We're going to be breaking down today, but you couldn't have a bigger victory than to begin moving in the direction of ensuring that citizens of this country, but others around the world, can simply communicate with each other.
[00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:14.536]  Twitter, first it was hundreds of accounts two days ago, now it's thousands of accounts ahead of the Tiananmen Square anniversary.
[00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:21.120]  Hundreds of accounts at the direction of the Chinese government
[00:11:22.506 --> 00:11:32.696]  Have been taken down because they're seen as being against the communist dictatorship that's killed tens of millions, well actually over 100 million, to stay in power.
[00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:39.362]  So to translate that, Twitter works with a regime that's killed five times what Hitler did.
[00:11:39.662 --> 00:11:40.443]  That's not disputed.
[00:11:41.924 --> 00:11:47.269]  Oh, but Twitter and Facebook and Google and Apple can name me a dangerous person.
[00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.031]  Facebook said the most dangerous.
[00:11:50.051 --> 00:11:53.434]  They said Alex Jones has a designation no one else has.
[00:11:53.995 --> 00:12:00.000]  He has a new level where you may not even say his name unless it's negative connotation.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.382]  So it's beyond Voldemort where you can't say my name.
[00:12:03.963 --> 00:12:09.307]  You can only say it if you say, to hell with Alex Jones or Alex Jones is a horrible person.
[00:12:09.347 --> 00:12:10.708]  You must disparage me.
[00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:12.310]  You must bully me.
[00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.712]  A big giant tech company.
[00:12:16.983 --> 00:12:27.851]  Hundreds of trillions, hundreds of billions of dollars, saying that you should all attack me, all 2.4 billion users.
[00:12:29.813 --> 00:12:32.375]  Well, that's not dangerous, that's not scary, that's not a problem.
[00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:45.124]  And then they back these governments that have killed over 100 million, back other governments that have killed tens of millions, back the forced relocation and 2 million people in China put in concentration camps, and it's all admitted, and Apple,
[00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.819]  And Google are at the vanguard.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.321]  They're at the forefront.
[00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:50.361]  They're at the tip of the spear.
[00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:55.205]  They are the Rangers, way out on the front.
[00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:12.679]  And they can sit there with their straight faces, splattered with bloodthirst, telling the world that someone with no criminal record, someone who never heard a fly that didn't attack me first,
[00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:17.570]  Somebody that's a sweet daddy with three daughters and a great son.
[00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:21.331]  I'm the dangerous one, you see.
[00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:32.855]  I'm the bad man, says Tim Cook, who owns and runs and contracts the worst factories, according to even Amnesty International, in the world.
[00:13:33.315 --> 00:13:39.617]  Out of all the tens of thousands of sweatshops and slave factories, nobody can top Apple.
[00:13:40.217 --> 00:13:40.657]  Nobody.
[00:13:40.757 --> 00:13:42.298]  But because he's skinny,
[00:13:43.527 --> 00:13:47.650]  And he hops around saying, I'm gay, I'm gay, every 15 seconds.
[00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:53.554]  We must bow to him because he's gay, he's gay, he's gay, he's gay.
[00:13:53.574 --> 00:13:56.156]  Did he tell you Tim Cook is gay?
[00:13:56.476 --> 00:13:59.779]  So it's okay that he runs slave factories.
[00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:03.241]  You care less if you're gay.
[00:14:03.561 --> 00:14:04.082]  Who cares?
[00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:17.317]  Don't wear it like some armor of invulnerability, of invincibility, where you can just do whatever you want, whenever you want, by hopping around and going, why did I ban Alex Jones?
[00:14:17.377 --> 00:14:19.518]  Why is this obvious?
[00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.880]  He's a horrible person!
[00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:27.103]  Yes, I don't kiss your evil engineer's butt.
[00:14:28.524 --> 00:14:32.646]  You look at Tim Cook in almost all interviews, under lights, he's almost pure pupil.
[00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:33.807]  That boy...
[00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.536]  He's on some hardcore designer drugs.
[00:14:40.117 --> 00:14:46.942]  Maybe he's on so many drugs like Meth Mouth AOC that he actually believes his own crap.
[00:14:47.823 --> 00:14:53.528]  But history shows again and again that tyrants like you fall.
[00:14:53.928 --> 00:14:58.972]  And if you look at the way the wind's been blowing and if you look at how everything's been unfolding,
[00:15:00.486 --> 00:15:06.070]  It is the season for people like you to fall into oblivion and to fall forever.
[00:15:07.051 --> 00:15:07.751]  We're going to go to break.
[00:15:08.672 --> 00:15:12.835]  I met this morning with our crew and I came up with new specials we're going to be launching tomorrow.
[00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:19.059]  Always takes you a few extra days to do those, but that's good news for a lot of folks because we've got a really amazing sale going.
[00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:25.044]  40 to 60% off that has great products and also funds the second American Revolution, 1776, worldwide.
[00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:34.794]  We have 60% off MycoZX, which is the other side of what you'd call probiotics.
[00:15:34.874 --> 00:15:37.095]  It knocks out the mold, the candida, the yeast, all that stuff.
[00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:41.177]  Whereas other type of probiotics just give you the good bacteria, which are important.
[00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:48.220]  50% off the 8-pack PowerStack Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, Vitamineral Fusion, Ultimate Bone Broth, Supramole Vitality.
[00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:50.792]  40% off Turbo Force.
[00:15:51.252 --> 00:15:53.834]  Chocolate and vanilla protein bars are so great and more.
[00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:56.455]  All at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:56.615 --> 00:15:57.696]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.837]  Sign up for auto-ship an additional 10% off.
[00:16:00.017 --> 00:16:01.718]  Whatever you do, take action now.
[00:16:02.499 --> 00:16:03.119]  Most of you know...
[00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:22.782]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:33.869]  I was just at a local t-shirt shop six months ago and I bought a t-shirt that showed the space shuttle blasting off into space.
[00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.233]  And I happened to wear that on Joe Rogan's podcast and people just talked about the shirt everywhere.
[00:16:39.813 --> 00:16:42.035]  All these websites got started selling the shirt.
[00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:44.583]  Because it's a NASA patch.
[00:16:45.184 --> 00:16:47.165]  So it's copyright free, it's government.
[00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:49.207]  But I had it redone.
[00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:51.248]  Where it says Space Force.
[00:16:52.404 --> 00:16:55.686]  And we made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:58.028]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[00:16:58.468 --> 00:17:03.011]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with Infowars.com.
[00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:06.773]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify.
[00:17:07.073 --> 00:17:08.754]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:13.237]  Now, the 18-wheeler, printed, produced, made in America, arrives next Wednesday.
[00:17:13.317 --> 00:17:15.138]  But I want to do some fanfare on this shirt.
[00:17:15.358 --> 00:17:17.480]  I believe this is going to be the next Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.901]  But it's about a pro-human future.
[00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:22.382]  It's about humanity going to the stars.
[00:17:23.023 --> 00:17:27.746]  It's about believing in the amazing gifts that God's given us.
[00:17:27.806 --> 00:17:28.566]  We're not gods.
[00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:29.386]  We're not going to be gods.
[00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:30.487]  We're made in the image of God.
[00:17:30.687 --> 00:17:31.988]  So we're a reflection.
[00:17:32.408 --> 00:17:33.709]  So we can do some amazing things.
[00:17:33.749 --> 00:17:34.930]  We're master builders.
[00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:40.293]  And the Space Shuttle's 1930s technology put into function in the late 1970s, retired five years ago.
[00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:40.753]  And so
[00:17:40.933 --> 00:17:41.493]  We've redone it.
[00:17:41.674 --> 00:17:47.517]  Also, I had people on the street love the shirt, but a few have gone, why are you wearing that gay rainbow flag?
[00:17:47.717 --> 00:17:49.659]  And that's when I decided a few months ago to make the shirt.
[00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:55.483]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sick of leftist groups or whoever expropriating or appropriating symbols.
[00:17:55.803 --> 00:17:59.585]  If you're a homosexual and you're not doing illegal stuff, I don't care what you do in your bedroom.
[00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.947]  That's the left claiming that conservatives are obsessed with what you're doing.
[00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:04.048]  Just leave kids alone with your heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:06.330]  Plus, it's not a classic rainbow.
[00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.851]  It's supposed to be the atmosphere.
[00:18:08.531 --> 00:18:10.313]  Anybody that knows, that's why NASA created this.
[00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:15.837]  Below in the atmosphere is more dust and stuff than a spectrometer or in a telescope, it's red.
[00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:18.939]  And as you get higher, it's orange.
[00:18:18.979 --> 00:18:25.524]  That's why the sun on the horizon is red, because you're looking through hundreds of miles of atmosphere to a few miles of atmosphere.
[00:18:25.544 --> 00:18:27.605]  So clear sky is black.
[00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:31.508]  Below that is blue, then it's yellow, then it's orange, then it's red.
[00:18:31.568 --> 00:18:33.410]  That's why out of thousands of
[00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.090]  Space shuttle patches.
[00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.810]  They've got thousands.
[00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.631]  It took me days to actually find the original patch.
[00:18:37.931 --> 00:18:39.371]  So this is a copy of the original patch.
[00:18:39.772 --> 00:18:42.872]  We put Space Force on it and established 2020.
[00:18:42.992 --> 00:18:45.213]  American flag on the side.
[00:18:45.453 --> 00:18:46.393]  I designed this shirt.
[00:18:46.753 --> 00:18:47.974]  I'm very proud of this shirt.
[00:18:48.534 --> 00:18:49.734]  And maybe I'm wrong.
[00:18:50.374 --> 00:18:52.695]  But when I think this is Zeitgeist, it tends to be a Zeitgeist.
[00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:57.734]  I've had other shirts, hundreds of thousands of which have been put on the street.
[00:18:57.755 --> 00:18:59.236]  And it's helped fund our operation as well.
[00:18:59.276 --> 00:19:06.721]  But this shirt has such a nice fabric, made in America, all of it, that it cost us $10 a shirt.
[00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:09.363]  I did a huge order and got it down for $13.
[00:19:11.434 --> 00:19:12.855]  Printing and the quality of the shirt.
[00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:14.937]  And we're coming up with a women's version as well.
[00:19:14.977 --> 00:19:15.858]  Women can wear this as well.
[00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:17.699]  I'm very proud of it.
[00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:18.940]  People are going to be like, what is that?
[00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:21.102]  What is Space Force?
[00:19:21.142 --> 00:19:22.863]  So it's kind of an undercover thing too.
[00:19:22.883 --> 00:19:27.547]  It's like, you might get hit in the head with a bike lock or stabbed if you're a Trump supporter and you're out there doing something.
[00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.248]  And you're wearing a Trump shirt, Infowars shirt.
[00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:30.369]  People still love those and wear them.
[00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:31.730]  What about a Space Force?
[00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:38.096]  What about loving technology and what we built and having a pro-human future in space and the American flag that triggers so many.
[00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:39.477]  Littleinfowars.com.
[00:19:39.857 --> 00:19:40.918]  I think this is a shirt show.
[00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:43.040]  Pre-order, I never do pre-orders on t-shirts.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.503]  We'll have it next week, it'll be shipped out by the end of the week, but get your order first.
[00:19:46.683 --> 00:19:50.806]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:19:50.926 --> 00:19:58.833]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:08.562]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:29.057]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:33.861]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.551]  The fight is on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:42.552 --> 00:20:55.319]  Big Tech tried to hypnotize the world as they openly allied themselves with the murderous communist chi-coms and tell us that, oh, no one can regulate us on speech!
[00:20:57.801 --> 00:21:08.307]  And then they would use their corporate freedom to then violate everybody else's rights on their platforms and bully and dox and harass anyone that was Christian or pro-America or pro-freedom.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.521]  Or pro-self-defense.
[00:21:12.142 --> 00:21:15.765]  But what about being giant trust?
[00:21:15.905 --> 00:21:24.351]  What about being giant monopolies and working with all the rest of Silicon Valley to ban Alex Jones in one day?
[00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:26.992]  And then to start banning others?
[00:21:27.935 --> 00:21:30.937]  Bringing in the Communist Chinese social score, which is their model.
[00:21:31.157 --> 00:21:35.999]  That showed the world they're working in concert to shut down their competition.
[00:21:36.499 --> 00:21:41.562]  And Facebook, and Apple, and Google buy hundreds of companies a year.
[00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:46.785]  I saw a report last year where Google had bought over a thousand companies in one year.
[00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.772]  You go, how do they do that?
[00:21:49.832 --> 00:21:51.153]  They're worth almost a trillion dollars.
[00:21:51.693 --> 00:21:52.754]  Apple's worth almost a trillion.
[00:21:53.394 --> 00:21:54.555]  Facebook, close to a trillion.
[00:21:55.296 --> 00:22:00.360]  They go out and buy anything and everything up so that there's no competition.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.641]  What did Eisenhower warn of?
[00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:07.766]  Beware the power of the consolidated technological elite.
[00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:17.545]  In control of government research labs, working with private corporations, creating monopolies of scientific development, and consolidating control.
[00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:19.606]  That was his full statement.
[00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:25.108]  Then he said, beware the military-industrial complex.
[00:22:26.829 --> 00:22:31.291]  They're buying everything up to kill the competition.
[00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:34.152]  And that's just downright un-American.
[00:22:35.033 --> 00:22:37.994]  And so we're gonna bust their asses up.
[00:22:39.463 --> 00:22:44.384]  Anybody like Gab or anybody tries to build their own social network, they come after you.
[00:22:44.424 --> 00:22:45.484]  The banks come after you.
[00:22:45.924 --> 00:22:46.945]  Google comes after you.
[00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:51.526]  They work in concert to create a centralized system.
[00:22:54.126 --> 00:22:55.446]  Let's go to this important report.
[00:22:55.967 --> 00:23:02.388]  Antitrust suits threaten the technocratic tyranny of big tech.
[00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:13.524]  Recently, of all sources, a Bloomberg opinion piece threatened the tech industry by titling the article, Google Should Be Afraid, Very Afraid.
[00:23:13.844 --> 00:23:16.745]  The piece continues, this is the moment the U.S.
[00:23:16.805 --> 00:23:19.206]  technology superpower surely knew was coming.
[00:23:19.926 --> 00:23:20.407]  The U.S.
[00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:26.253]  government is preparing to crawl all over Google to figure out whether it is an abusive monopolist.
[00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:33.720]  Google parent company Alphabet Incorporated and the other tech giants should be quaking in their fleece vests.
[00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:42.369]  It was reported recently that the Department of Justice is preparing to open an investigation into Google's compliance with antitrust laws.
[00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.091]  But has the tech industry actually gotten the message?
[00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:57.035]  Replete with all of its hubris and billions flowing in from the Saudis and the Chinese, if Silicon Valley were a country, it would be one of the richest countries on Earth.
[00:23:57.415 --> 00:23:59.396]  And it might as well be another country.
[00:23:59.756 --> 00:24:08.039]  It certainly holds the rights of its host country in utter contempt, which is why the Justice Department is finally doing something about it.
[00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:11.302]  I mean, after all, we are supposed to have laws, right?
[00:24:11.603 --> 00:24:15.467]  Reuters continued to analyze how the tech giants had rigged the game.
[00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:25.958]  One source said the potential investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, focused on accusations that Google gave preference to its own businesses and searches.
[00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:33.485]  Early in 2013, the FTC closed a long-running investigation of Google, giving it a slap on the wrist.
[00:24:33.946 --> 00:24:49.720]  Under FTC pressure, Google agreed to end the practice of scraping reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products, and to let advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:25:05.286]  Google Search, YouTube Reviews, Maps, and other businesses which are largely free to consumers, but finance through advertising, have catapulted it from a startup to one of the world's richest companies in just two decades.
[00:25:05.746 --> 00:25:12.789]  And Amazon, with its single-handed decimation of retail outlets across the United States, is preparing for the worst.
[00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:20.153]  As San Francisco Gate reports, Amazon could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S.
[00:25:20.213 --> 00:25:23.995]  regulators that puts it under closer watch by the FTC.
[00:25:24.215 --> 00:25:30.218]  While Facebook continues to dox the privacy of those merely using its fascistic platform,
[00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:36.322]  To criticize one of those holding the most public of all public offices, the Speaker of the House.
[00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:45.989]  As Jamie White reported, Facebook has helped far-left publication, The Daily Beast, dox the user behind the Pelosi meme that went viral last week.
[00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:58.679]  In pursuing the identity of the person who uploaded a slowed down video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slurring and stammering during a press conference, which was only made more surreal by slowing it down,
[00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:07.024]  Facebook confirmed to the Daily Beast the account belonged to one Sean Brooks, a black 34-year-old day laborer and Trump supporter.
[00:26:07.224 --> 00:26:19.652]  But a Facebook official confirming a Daily Beast investigation said the video was first posted on Politics Watchdog directly from Brooks' personal Facebook account, according to the Daily Beast report.
[00:26:19.972 --> 00:26:28.979]  Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, Bezos' Amazon, and YouTube's cannibalistic algorithm is the crazed mustang elephant in the room.
[00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:41.108]  Zuckerberg's lawyer recently argued that users have no expectation of privacy, which completely contradicts Zuckerberg's claim that he will be making Facebook more private in the near future.
[00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:59.362]  Meanwhile, Facebook aids serial bank robbing kidnappers, the platform fueled a genocide in Myanmar, and puts the Speaker of the United States, Congress, favored by an invading small country known as Silicon Valley, dominating the United States Bill of Rights and its citizens.
[00:26:59.962 --> 00:27:01.143]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:27:08.755 --> 00:27:13.617]  This amazing report that you just listened to or your TV viewer just watched is very important.
[00:27:14.198 --> 00:27:17.039]  It's such a powerful, short, little four and a half minute report.
[00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:17.960]  I don't know what to call it.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.481]  See the report, Big Tech Fears?
[00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:26.144]  See the report?
[00:27:28.985 --> 00:27:34.147]  Showing... Show the... See the report documenting Big Tech's crimes?
[00:27:35.948 --> 00:27:36.208]  I don't know.
[00:27:36.228 --> 00:27:36.929]  We're going to post it.
[00:27:38.103 --> 00:27:39.244]  TimFullWars.com.
[00:27:39.284 --> 00:27:40.484]  It's not even been posted yet.
[00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:47.228]  TimFullWars.com and NewsWars.com and we'll post it up there at the top.
[00:27:47.468 --> 00:27:48.709]  Hopefully all of you will tweet it.
[00:27:48.849 --> 00:27:50.150]  Hopefully all of you will Facebook it.
[00:27:50.770 --> 00:28:05.859]  Hopefully all of you will put it up on YouTube and get it out yourself because, you know, they've tried to set the precedent to kick us off all these platforms, but then also tell you you're not allowed to put it back up and to even try to tell other talk show hosts they can't have us on.
[00:28:06.775 --> 00:28:18.104]  And I can tell you that's part of the whole antitrust investigation is serious civil rights abuse of the average American telling them who they can talk about, who they can promote.
[00:28:18.444 --> 00:28:19.305]  That's cult-like.
[00:28:19.325 --> 00:28:23.228]  And it's extremely illegal and extremely dangerous.
[00:28:23.948 --> 00:28:29.933]  And so I can tell you that the White House and the Federal Trade Commission and others are looking at that.
[00:28:30.033 --> 00:28:30.874]  I can tell you that
[00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:38.384]  Bob Barnes, who'll be back in studio, constitutional lawyer, has been up in D.C.
[00:28:38.944 --> 00:28:41.085]  talking to the top Republicans and others.
[00:28:41.826 --> 00:28:42.887]  And so we mean business.
[00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:48.650]  And we are going to be filing suit against the globalists and big tech in the next few months.
[00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:52.252]  That's why it's more critical than ever that you give us financial support.
[00:28:52.793 --> 00:28:53.793]  We're in one hell of a fight.
[00:28:53.813 --> 00:28:55.094]  Without you, we're going to lose.
[00:28:55.394 --> 00:28:58.416]  With your help, ladies and gentlemen, we're invincible.
[00:29:18.477 --> 00:29:22.581]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:39.060]  Yo, bro, what's up?
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.480]  Let's get down and go around.
[00:29:41.081 --> 00:29:42.361]  You think you're f***ing tough?
[00:29:42.381 --> 00:29:43.062]  You're about to get it.
[00:29:43.222 --> 00:29:44.262]  I will break your jaw.
[00:29:44.322 --> 00:29:45.483]  I will knock your teeth out.
[00:29:45.563 --> 00:29:46.444]  I will break your nose.
[00:29:46.464 --> 00:29:47.464]  I will break your neck.
[00:29:47.964 --> 00:29:48.845]  I'm not afraid of you people.
[00:29:49.425 --> 00:29:52.567]  You're a little wimp, you son of a piece of garbage.
[00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:53.847]  I hate you.
[00:29:54.068 --> 00:29:55.068]  My listeners hate you.
[00:29:55.208 --> 00:29:56.909]  And remember that scumbag forever.
[00:29:57.589 --> 00:29:59.810]  If you don't spread the links, the globalists win.
[00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:00.791]  Spread the links!
[00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:11.718]  I personally don't want to hate people from the Middle East.
[00:30:12.858 --> 00:30:14.919]  And I personally don't want to be at war with Muslims.
[00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:19.501]  And I understand there's a larger globalist plan for a clash of civilizations.
[00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:31.105]  But if your daughter gets kicked down a subway stairs by a group of Islamists because they think, you know, that she's a profane, you know, dog creature because she's a Christian or whatever, the police and the media try to cover it up and that's wrong.
[00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:32.446]  And so if a horde of
[00:30:32.566 --> 00:30:34.067]  I understand it's a manipulated collision.
[00:30:34.087 --> 00:30:35.968]  I understand it's a manipulated clash.
[00:30:36.048 --> 00:30:39.370]  But it doesn't change the fact if you're on the receiving end of it and capitulating to it.
[00:30:54.255 --> 00:31:00.899]  And going along and saying, oh, Islam's great, it's a religion of peace, there isn't a class of civilizations happening, only adds to the globalist program.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:20.452]  We must be honest about the cancer that has become Islam in this current permutation, and the fact that the globalism is cancer, and the fact that the left's system is cancer, and the fact that mainline churches that just want to be country clubs have become cancers, and that the 5G, and the GMO, and the big drug companies, knowing they're giving us stuff that kills us and makes us more depressed, they're a cancer too.
[00:31:20.492 --> 00:31:22.153]  There's a lot of damn evil going on here.
[00:31:22.253 --> 00:31:29.937]  So I don't sit here and shake my finger at the Muslims like I'm high and mighty, like a Pharisee up here, or a hypocrite, and say, you're the only bad people in the world.
[00:31:30.037 --> 00:31:30.277]  No.
[00:31:30.537 --> 00:31:32.218]  We got a lot of evil going around here.
[00:31:32.238 --> 00:31:34.038]  You'll see examples in the U.S.
[00:31:34.118 --> 00:31:40.862]  and in England where they're trying to teach five-year-old boys and girls, boys, they're girls, and girls, they're boys, and trying to teach five-year-olds about anal sex.
[00:31:41.062 --> 00:31:48.865]  And the Muslims come in there and they say, our kids are pulled out of here, and they protest, and then the school stops it or says, Muslims don't have to go, but nobody else will stand for their kids.
[00:31:48.905 --> 00:31:50.366]  So that's the point I'm getting at here.
[00:31:50.506 --> 00:31:50.967]  I don't know.
[00:32:10.356 --> 00:32:14.019]  I don't care if it's in Africa, the Middle East, the United States, Europe, Asia.
[00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:20.946]  You've got people that are becoming disconnected from reality, and who are not self-aware, who will do basically anything at any time.
[00:32:21.026 --> 00:32:23.228]  And it's going to create a world meltdown.
[00:32:23.348 --> 00:32:24.929]  It's going to create a societal collapse.
[00:32:24.949 --> 00:32:30.795]  Because if you don't want to work, the systems will basically let you live for free, but you've got to follow their political aim to conquer.
[00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:32.936]  But if you want to be free, you've got to work more, more, more.
[00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:36.280]  But when you hit that point, where the globalists finally take over,
[00:32:37.193 --> 00:32:42.006]  They're going to have their own weird right-wing backlash that I think is going to be very, very dangerous as well.
[00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:45.234]  It's a serious time, folks, and we need God more than ever.
[00:33:07.003 --> 00:33:09.744]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.927 --> 00:33:17.687]  Big Brother.
[00:33:18.627 --> 00:33:19.888]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:20.948 --> 00:33:22.169]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:22.749 --> 00:33:24.189]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:24.809 --> 00:33:26.130]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.552]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.311 --> 00:33:37.192]  You know what's amazing?
[00:33:39.533 --> 00:34:03.466]  If you go back just 10 years ago, when corporate media lined up for the nightly news, you would have the same sponsors in the same order during the breaks, almost all the time, and you would also always have the same news stories in the same order with the same talking points on ABC, CBS, NBC, you name it.
[00:34:05.302 --> 00:34:08.784]  Fox came in and just changed the talking points just a little bit.
[00:34:10.946 --> 00:34:18.770]  But now today, nine times out of ten, the public just doesn't believe the talking points put out by corporate media.
[00:34:19.471 --> 00:34:26.415]  And the perspective, or the view, or the analysis put out here becomes the talking point.
[00:34:27.035 --> 00:34:34.220]  And they've tracked back, because of our activist audience, and how informed you are, that InfoWars, the majority of the time,
[00:34:35.708 --> 00:34:42.571]  For talk radio is the place where countervailing points are made to the establishment.
[00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:51.035]  Now that isn't again about getting up on a mountain and thumping my chest and saying, I'm so good, I'm so great.
[00:34:51.135 --> 00:34:58.839]  Without DrudgeReport.com being able to really set the agenda for newsrooms, we wouldn't even have moved the ball down the field.
[00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:02.641]  Drudge, when it just comes to making things a focal point
[00:35:03.806 --> 00:35:12.934]  In many cases that the mainstream media isn't focused on and then causing them to follow his lead is unprecedented in the annals of telecommunications and news.
[00:35:14.455 --> 00:35:23.903]  So I simply point out how we're winning this fight against the globalists and why they're trying to shut us down and why they're trying to censor is because we're kicking the living snot out of them.
[00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:31.169]  And it was an extremely bold, reckless move to come out
[00:35:32.188 --> 00:35:39.213]  And try to engage in open draconian blacklisting, the likes of which Joseph McCarthy never dreamed of.
[00:35:40.014 --> 00:35:45.938]  And not just the blacklisting, the defamation, the demonization, the lying about the people once you've silenced them.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:57.146]  It's really mind-blowing that this isn't some 1984 novel projecting into the future some dystopia.
[00:35:57.506 --> 00:35:57.766]  This is
[00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:05.514]  The dystopia attempting to take over free nations and, in many cases, failing.
[00:36:06.415 --> 00:36:08.216]  Because they can censor in the short term.
[00:36:08.837 --> 00:36:16.222]  They can get up there and crow like roosters from the rooftops, but it always fails long term.
[00:36:16.242 --> 00:36:23.467]  And it's failing very, very quickly now.
[00:36:24.968 --> 00:36:26.689]  So this is an amazing time to be alive.
[00:36:29.315 --> 00:36:29.996]  Make no mistake.
[00:36:30.076 --> 00:36:31.817]  But how are the globalists going to counter?
[00:36:33.198 --> 00:36:35.260]  They're going to counter with imploding borders.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.143]  They're going to counter with government programs designed to undermine society.
[00:36:39.403 --> 00:36:46.168]  They're going to counter with racial and cultural and religious and sexual balkanization.
[00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:56.597]  And it's in the Democratic talking points to create liberation theology and to make young people's worldview, their identity,
[00:36:57.873 --> 00:37:06.977]  Be fighting the evil America and believing America sucks, even though they fight to get into America at the same time.
[00:37:07.737 --> 00:37:09.258]  That's a very dangerous operating system.
[00:37:09.298 --> 00:37:16.001]  But if you look at every blue city, every blue state, they can't hide it anymore.
[00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:22.803]  The giant open air sewers, the rats, the bizarreness, the Sodom and Gomorrah behavior.
[00:37:23.204 --> 00:37:23.684]  When I was in
[00:37:27.364 --> 00:37:32.349]  Skid Row and we're going to play these videos next segment in Los Angeles.
[00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:37.435]  That's right around the police department and it was go on for 10, 15 blocks in all directions.
[00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:47.946]  I saw things that I couldn't go over with a camera and film because I was going to throw up.
[00:37:51.431 --> 00:37:52.832]  And I actually can't even say this on air.
[00:37:53.432 --> 00:37:54.533]  We've got a couple of reports.
[00:37:54.553 --> 00:37:55.114]  We put them out.
[00:37:55.234 --> 00:38:02.379]  I never even aired them here because I actually didn't want to relive seeing it and just seeing them put what they put up on screen.
[00:38:02.479 --> 00:38:04.100]  I almost threw up and I'm not kidding.
[00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:14.067]  Because we were going to still be there for another hour and I had to leave and we had an LAPD detective who was off duty that escorted us down there.
[00:38:16.749 --> 00:38:20.172]  And yeah, here we are going inside of some of these tents with Katie Hopkins.
[00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:25.478]  And he's got his disabled wife, and there's some of these folks that are really, really sad.
[00:38:25.498 --> 00:38:26.919]  A lot of folks are on heroin.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:40.087]  But, when I had to leave, we had stopped and were filming and talking to some people, and I looked over in a tent, and there were two people having sex in it.
[00:38:45.184 --> 00:38:46.866]  Seriously, if I pull this up in my brain, I'm gonna throw up.
[00:38:47.186 --> 00:38:48.087]  But people need to hear this.
[00:38:49.268 --> 00:38:50.510]  And there was horrible smell.
[00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:53.212]  Smells you can't describe.
[00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:55.835]  Beyond sewage, beyond rotting food.
[00:38:55.855 --> 00:38:58.157]  There's a smell of like sex.
[00:38:59.378 --> 00:38:59.639]  Okay?
[00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:02.341]  And like out of a zombie movie.
[00:39:02.361 --> 00:39:08.107]  You think you've seen zombies crawl out of graves or be crawling through the shopping mall all bleeding with their guts hanging out?
[00:39:09.758 --> 00:39:12.099]  Yeah, that's on TV's real footage of homeless people.
[00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:13.200]  Wow, how'd you guys find that?
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.721]  That's exactly what I saw.
[00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:33.611]  There was a black man with a wig on, with a white guy with huge breasts, so he obviously was giving hormone treatments, having sex, and I'm not even, I'm sitting there doing an interview, and I look over in this tent, and I go, what in the hell is that?
[00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:35.552]  They're having sex.
[00:39:37.076 --> 00:40:03.993]  So I turn around for two minutes, ignore it, all of a sudden, like zombies, they've crawled out, and are coming at me, and the man has put his shirt back on, he has big breasts, and there's sweat all over him, and the smell is deafening, and they're both looking at me with sexual desire, and I look down to the black guy, and he had, like, rolls of fat, but he was skinny, hanging down like, like melting,
[00:40:05.413 --> 00:40:05.853]  Wax.
[00:40:06.434 --> 00:40:08.555]  And you could see the spinal cord.
[00:40:08.675 --> 00:40:09.476]  There was nothing there.
[00:40:09.796 --> 00:40:11.958]  And I looked down and the feet were rotting.
[00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:14.480]  They looked grosser than zombies.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.482]  And there were flies all over his genitals.
[00:40:21.905 --> 00:40:25.627]  And I began to throw up.
[00:40:27.169 --> 00:40:30.211]  And the LAPD detective said, yeah, it's bad.
[00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:31.412]  He had a handkerchief over his face.
[00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:32.112]  And we ran.
[00:40:32.332 --> 00:40:32.712]  We ran.
[00:40:32.732 --> 00:40:33.413]  We started running.
[00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:41.103]  Let me tell you folks, I've never seen anything like it.
[00:40:41.143 --> 00:40:45.506]  I've had to drag with a tractor a dead horse when I worked on a ranch that had maggots all over it.
[00:40:45.887 --> 00:40:50.671]  I've seen car wrecks where I pulled over to rent a grave where somebody's head was almost completely cut off.
[00:40:51.051 --> 00:40:52.172]  There was blood spraying everywhere.
[00:40:52.452 --> 00:40:52.993]  And I knew him.
[00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:53.773]  I went to high school with him.
[00:40:54.654 --> 00:40:55.815]  It was nothing.
[00:40:56.636 --> 00:40:57.116]  Nothing.
[00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:01.000]  Because the sickening gravy
[00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:04.502]  On top of the mess was what was so sick.
[00:41:05.102 --> 00:41:15.925]  The people enjoying the 90 degree heat, sweat all over them, having sex with what looked like two zombies.
[00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:20.687]  And I'll never forget looking down at the stomach.
[00:41:21.698 --> 00:41:24.502]  Because I started looking head-to-toe as the zombies are advancing.
[00:41:24.742 --> 00:41:26.284]  By the time I turned around, they were like six feet away.
[00:41:26.304 --> 00:41:27.305]  I'm like, oh!
[00:41:28.006 --> 00:41:32.692]  And all of a sudden, I just looked down and I was like, what the hell?
[00:41:33.493 --> 00:41:36.017]  Because one of them was wearing like a tube top.
[00:41:38.516 --> 00:41:44.158]  And there was like, again, like giblets hanging down, but you could see the spinal cord in his tiny waist.
[00:41:44.678 --> 00:41:51.721]  And, and, and it just went, but with sexual desire and I could smell it and it was flies all over.
[00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:53.862]  And I started throwing up.
[00:41:53.962 --> 00:41:55.763]  I think I'm gonna do it again for the memory.
[00:41:57.563 --> 00:41:58.504]  We actually ran.
[00:42:02.285 --> 00:42:02.665]  We ran.
[00:42:04.706 --> 00:42:04.966]  We ran.
[00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:16.186]  I remember the LAPD cop, we had another security people with us, as we jogged out, they're going, yeah, let's just get the hell out of here.
[00:42:16.226 --> 00:42:17.047]  We don't need to be here anymore.
[00:42:17.507 --> 00:42:34.563]  And again, it's not that you're afraid of the drug dealers threatening you or any of that, it's that when you're around piles of human feces and gutters filled with urine and all of it, and then you see people that look like zombies having sex in the middle of it, you know
[00:42:36.843 --> 00:42:38.464]  You know that this is Satan's work.
[00:42:39.665 --> 00:42:40.146]  Unbelievable.
[00:42:40.766 --> 00:42:41.807]  And I haven't told you the worst part.
[00:42:41.847 --> 00:42:58.661]  There were all these young women, 18, 19, 20 years old, who looked very pretty, a little like zombies now, who would be like sitting there with their pimps being sold with all the needles around them and right in front of the department because the police are ordered not to stop them.
[00:42:59.802 --> 00:43:01.043]  Yes, folks, it's beyond evil.
[00:43:02.364 --> 00:43:03.265]  The Globalist News.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:15.123]  We're on a planet in the middle of gorgeous space, way out on the edge of a little galaxy, and Hubble Telescope has photographed 500 billion plus galaxies.
[00:43:15.263 --> 00:43:18.324]  And that's a 19, early 1990s telescope.
[00:43:18.384 --> 00:43:20.725]  They got new ones up there, they won't let us see what they're getting.
[00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:23.653]  I mean, we are little babies.
[00:43:23.893 --> 00:43:28.756]  But God told us 2,000 years ago there'll be a world government, there'll be a cashless system to buy and sell.
[00:43:28.936 --> 00:43:30.037]  It's only going to last a while.
[00:43:30.257 --> 00:43:31.258]  You've been given free will.
[00:43:31.458 --> 00:43:32.359]  I have to do this to you.
[00:43:32.479 --> 00:43:34.720]  But if you make the right choice, I'm waiting on the other side.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:46.288]  And I don't want to do this to you, but you've been given full consciousness as a little G. Only thing an omnipresent entity like God can do is create new creatures that have the seed of the universe in them and the potentiality to do anything.
[00:43:46.348 --> 00:43:47.089]  You have free will.
[00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:48.710]  You have a piece of God in you.
[00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:49.670]  A seed of the universe.
[00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:56.232]  And God literally, as the Bible says, God loves a sparrow of the field so much when it dies.
[00:43:56.272 --> 00:43:56.833]  A little bird.
[00:43:57.233 --> 00:43:58.513]  Imagine how much God loves you.
[00:43:58.653 --> 00:44:00.594]  But God isn't creating robots.
[00:44:01.014 --> 00:44:03.815]  And God already created the angels and gave them free will.
[00:44:03.995 --> 00:44:05.176]  And a bunch of them turned against him.
[00:44:05.336 --> 00:44:05.736]  One third.
[00:44:05.756 --> 00:44:10.558]  Imagine, we're dealing with God's malfunctioning, rebelling creation that was given free will.
[00:44:10.718 --> 00:44:11.058]  Lucifer.
[00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:12.198]  And what does Lucifer want to do?
[00:44:12.238 --> 00:44:13.819]  Lucifer is jealous as hell.
[00:44:13.879 --> 00:44:14.459]  You're Lucifer.
[00:44:14.639 --> 00:44:15.719]  You're really old.
[00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:17.460]  A hundred billion, trillion years old?
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.100]  Who knows?
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.220]  God gave us a cheat sheet.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.141]  Listen, I want you to join me, but I got to do this to you, because it's free will.
[00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:22.941]  I don't want slaves.
[00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:25.342]  I can create robots for servants all day.
[00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.642]  I love you so much.
[00:44:27.003 --> 00:44:28.443]  I'm putting everything I have got into you.
[00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:35.771]  Just please, please, please listen to me and just don't do these things because it'll bring you down.
[00:44:35.891 --> 00:44:40.132]  I want to be with you and God cries for all of us that fall to the devil.
[00:44:40.632 --> 00:44:41.152]  This is real.
[00:44:41.773 --> 00:44:43.133]  This whole planet is a test.
[00:44:43.373 --> 00:44:47.114]  So I was thinking during the break before last, I went from one building to the next.
[00:44:47.194 --> 00:44:52.635]  I was hurrying back over here with some articles and I stumbled over the door frame and fell on my face.
[00:44:55.094 --> 00:45:11.174]  When I hit my face and sprung back up, I went, we're not thanking God for globalism under attack, globalism failing everywhere, humanity starting to reignite, and then we're bitching and complaining that it's not good enough, it's not fast enough, and Trump doesn't do everything we want.
[00:45:11.434 --> 00:45:12.295]  Well, what are you doing?
[00:45:13.146 --> 00:45:13.826]  What am I doing?
[00:45:14.287 --> 00:45:14.887]  But it hit me.
[00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:18.328]  If we seek God's face, if we repent, that He'll come and He'll heal our land.
[00:45:18.388 --> 00:45:20.249]  And we're seeing the beginnings of that.
[00:45:20.289 --> 00:45:23.851]  We've got a long way to go, but we really should thank God for what's happening.
[00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:30.414]  And thank God for all the gifts, and the gift of consciousness, and the gift of God being willing to create His own children.
[00:45:30.754 --> 00:45:33.415]  And God loves us way more than any of us love our children.
[00:45:33.755 --> 00:45:36.757]  Imagine loving your child a thousand times that.
[00:45:36.777 --> 00:45:38.137]  Knowing that child's potential.
[00:45:38.437 --> 00:45:39.358]  Being omnipresent.
[00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:49.119]  But turning them loose in a pack of hyena-like devils, because it's what you've got to do, because they deserve consciousness.
[00:45:49.739 --> 00:45:55.204]  And you're not, God's not going to intervene other than touching our heart and giving us the blueprint.
[00:45:55.544 --> 00:45:57.106]  But if we reject God and we
[00:45:58.175 --> 00:46:00.877]  Climb up on top that devil, it's gonna lead us right into hell.
[00:46:01.197 --> 00:46:07.141]  And so, we should all thank God in sending His Son, Jesus Christ, as an example to us all because that's what it's all about.
[00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:10.003]  And the enemy hates it when we talk about Christ more than anything.
[00:46:10.203 --> 00:46:13.465]  The persecution of Christians is more than any other group because it's real.
[00:46:13.545 --> 00:46:14.466]  It's a blueprint.
[00:46:14.586 --> 00:46:15.967]  What you're told in the Bible is real.
[00:46:16.027 --> 00:46:19.049]  Not their misinterpretations, not their twisting, but the reality!
[00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:25.802]  Out of his own nostrils, out of his own breath, out of his own DNA.
[00:46:25.962 --> 00:46:34.745]  But he would let his own rebellious servant come against us, to test us, so that we would be good sons and daughters in the future.
[00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:45.268]  And then God has to sit there and watch billions of his sons and daughters fall to evil and be destroyed and be sucked in by these devils and taken into a black hole, into a pit forever.
[00:46:46.255 --> 00:46:48.918]  That's what God did for consciousness.
[00:46:48.958 --> 00:46:50.679]  That's what God did to make you.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.543]  That's what God did to give you this incredible power!
[00:46:55.704 --> 00:46:56.705]  You think about that.
[00:46:57.266 --> 00:46:59.928]  Now you know God.
[00:47:06.494 --> 00:47:09.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.722 --> 00:47:22.224]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:47:22.584 --> 00:47:24.145]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:35.971]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:47:36.091 --> 00:47:37.191]  Alex Jones here, live.
[00:47:37.932 --> 00:47:45.615]  And, you know, I apologize to the listeners for the gross details, but I don't apologize on the one end, because it's got to be done.
[00:47:45.635 --> 00:47:46.596]  You've got to know how bad it is.
[00:47:47.699 --> 00:47:58.986]  And I didn't even describe properly the two undead zombie creatures dressed like women that I saw having sex that then came after us.
[00:48:00.147 --> 00:48:09.573]  And unlike a zombie movie where they want your brains, it was a look of total desire and acting like women going, ahhh, a baby, ahhh.
[00:48:10.074 --> 00:48:16.478]  And again, you look down and there's flies all over these fetid panties that he's wearing.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:25.826]  And show the feet again, because we've got video of these two zombos, but I don't think we put it in the report because it was so gross.
[00:48:27.207 --> 00:48:29.188]  But we probably should, but the crew found it.
[00:48:29.528 --> 00:48:35.453]  That's what the feet on one of them looked like, but the stomach looked like that too.
[00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:41.217]  So I'm telling you folks, I've never seen anything like it.
[00:48:44.642 --> 00:48:52.147]  And I'm telling you, imagine like a shopping shirt, one of them was obviously on hormones, and big breasts with flies all over.
[00:48:52.167 --> 00:48:55.630]  It was a white guy with this wig on, drooling at me and others.
[00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:01.153]  And again, they'd just been having sex in the tent and came out because we were there 15 feet away.
[00:49:04.312 --> 00:49:08.773]  And I'm telling you, folks, you could go into any one of the tents, and people would death threat you.
[00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:13.454]  There were drug dealers out there with Escalades, with people that had just been out there a few months.
[00:49:14.014 --> 00:49:19.556]  So you'd see young girls that had, like, black eyes and, you know, look like your daughter out there.
[00:49:19.696 --> 00:49:22.216]  It was just unbelievable.
[00:49:22.316 --> 00:49:28.178]  And folks, it went on and on and on for mile after mile after mile after mile after mile after mile.
[00:49:30.658 --> 00:49:32.399]  And when you see somebody covered in flies,
[00:49:33.911 --> 00:49:41.958]  And sweat and everything else dragging one foot and going, oh baby, oh baby, let me take care of you.
[00:49:42.578 --> 00:49:44.920]  You know you've entered the ninth circle of hell.
[00:49:48.564 --> 00:49:50.745]  And again, if you're a radio listener, you're lucky you're not seeing this.
[00:49:50.785 --> 00:49:51.346]  But you know what?
[00:49:51.826 --> 00:49:54.809]  People have a right to know, folks, because we got to clean this up.
[00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.790]  Good God.
[00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:58.350]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.772]  There's so many of these reports, but here's this report on L.A.
[00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.333]  and typhoids back.
[00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:04.954]  The police are getting sick.
[00:50:05.414 --> 00:50:06.215]  Sewage everywhere.
[00:50:06.315 --> 00:50:07.596]  Kids are getting TB in school.
[00:50:07.896 --> 00:50:10.257]  Illegal aliens aren't allowed to be tested because that's racist.
[00:50:10.517 --> 00:50:11.758]  They're put right in class with people.
[00:50:11.998 --> 00:50:13.739]  It's the collapse of civilization by design.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.362]  Nobody's ever done this in any country unless they want to fall.
[00:50:17.762 --> 00:50:19.043]  Europe's doing the exact same thing.
[00:50:19.063 --> 00:50:19.943]  It's a U.N.
[00:50:20.043 --> 00:50:20.384]  attack.
[00:50:20.424 --> 00:50:20.764]  Here it is.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.744]  I have to begin with this shocking case out of L.A., and two friends of mine have told me about this.
[00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:35.191]  A police officer now has contracted that really rare and life-threatening illness, disease, typhoid fever.
[00:50:35.711 --> 00:50:41.256]  Now, fewer than 350 Americans contract this every year, so what's going on here?
[00:50:41.896 --> 00:50:46.940]  We have complete breakdown of the basic needs of civilization in Los Angeles right now.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.702]  We have the three prongs of airborne disease.
[00:50:50.742 --> 00:50:52.423]  Tuberculosis is exploding.
[00:50:52.904 --> 00:50:53.604]  Rodent-borne.
[00:50:53.644 --> 00:50:56.686]  We are one of the only major cities in the country that does not have a rodent control program.
[00:50:56.726 --> 00:50:58.347]  And sanitation is broken down.
[00:50:58.747 --> 00:51:00.248]  We had a typhus outbreak last summer.
[00:51:00.268 --> 00:51:01.950]  We will have a typhus outbreak this summer.
[00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.052]  I'm hearing from experts that bubonic plague is likely.
[00:51:05.112 --> 00:51:05.912]  It's already here.
[00:51:06.212 --> 00:51:07.493]  It will get onto the rat fleas.
[00:51:07.813 --> 00:51:11.196]  And then now finally we have this oral fecal root contamination.
[00:51:11.616 --> 00:51:12.998]  Which is typhoid fever.
[00:51:13.218 --> 00:51:13.940]  Three cases.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.001]  One confirmed.
[00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:16.063]  Probably three.
[00:51:16.083 --> 00:51:18.166]  This is unbelievable.
[00:51:18.426 --> 00:51:22.312]  I can't believe I live in a city where this is not third world, Laura.
[00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:23.754]  This is medieval.
[00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:27.380]  Third world countries are insulted if they are accused of being like this.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.101]  No city on earth tolerates this.
[00:51:30.341 --> 00:51:32.402]  The entire population is at risk.
[00:51:32.802 --> 00:51:41.806]  And God forbid if measles, this is a population that's suboptimally immunized, if measles gets in, I just have an image of myself on my knees in the gutter tending to people.
[00:51:41.826 --> 00:51:43.666]  Well stop right there buddy boy, Dr. Drew.
[00:51:44.527 --> 00:51:46.067]  It's the illegals bringing in the measles.
[00:51:46.107 --> 00:51:47.588]  The measles vaccine doesn't protect you.
[00:51:47.788 --> 00:51:49.369]  It admits that on the insert.
[00:51:49.709 --> 00:51:50.409]  So don't try that.
[00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.231]  But again, San Diego is the same.
[00:51:56.403 --> 00:52:07.665]  Long Beach, L.A., San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, New York.
[00:52:08.185 --> 00:52:09.646]  Austin now has shantytowns.
[00:52:10.406 --> 00:52:25.349]  I can walk 600 yards and show you giant piles of feces and people laying out on the ground pissing on themselves in three different directions.
[00:52:27.773 --> 00:52:30.274]  This has all been done by design.
[00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:32.455]  This is the collapse of civilization.
[00:52:32.495 --> 00:52:33.636]  We are flooded with heroin.
[00:52:34.156 --> 00:52:35.356]  We are flooded by the opiates.
[00:52:35.376 --> 00:52:40.979]  We are flooded by cities that put up with it and give these people money so they can keep the habits going.
[00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:45.681]  And there's these whole leftist systems that milk it and that control it on top.
[00:52:48.622 --> 00:52:50.103]  Let's go ahead and go to this report.
[00:52:50.243 --> 00:52:51.704]  Seattle is dead.
[00:52:52.084 --> 00:52:52.644]  Just part of it.
[00:52:52.924 --> 00:52:53.745]  Then we'll go to L.A.
[00:52:53.805 --> 00:52:54.145]  Here it is.
[00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.291]  Let me ask you something.
[00:53:03.851 --> 00:53:07.213]  What if Seattle is dying and we don't even know it?
[00:53:07.933 --> 00:53:13.176]  This story is about a seething, simmering anger that is now boiling over into outrage.
[00:53:13.716 --> 00:53:21.600]  It is about people who have felt compassion, yes, but who no longer feel safe, no longer feel like they are heard, no longer feel protected.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:31.448]  It is about lost souls who wander our streets, untethered to home or family or reality, chasing a drug which in turn chases them.
[00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:38.154]  It is about the damage they inflict on themselves to be sure, but also on the fabric of this place where we live.
[00:53:38.935 --> 00:53:49.044]  This story is about a beautiful jewel that has been violated and a crisis of faith amongst a generation of Seattleites falling out of love with their home.
[00:53:53.666 --> 00:53:55.488]  There is another part of this story, too.
[00:53:56.028 --> 00:54:00.432]  It's about a solution, an idea for a city that has run out of them.
[00:54:01.012 --> 00:54:04.195]  And I ask again... Let's stop right there, and we'll just roll some of the B-roll for TV viewers.
[00:54:07.818 --> 00:54:12.882]  Criminal elements of our government on record are shipping narcotics into the U.S.
[00:54:12.922 --> 00:54:14.163]  They've been caught over and over again.
[00:54:14.183 --> 00:54:14.784]  I know that...
[00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:30.197]  Army officers who were in Afghanistan under Obama, when they would tell them, get your men addicted, and Russian helicopters would land delivering them prescription opioids, saying, oh, you're stressed out, you all just need this.
[00:54:30.678 --> 00:54:32.119]  Not blaming the Russians, this is who would deliver it.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:39.304]  Pentagon would send these drugs in to get them addicted, so they would then be dealers and help bring it back into the U.S.
[00:54:39.384 --> 00:54:42.567]  and wouldn't talk when the C-130s were loaded with the heroin.
[00:54:44.127 --> 00:54:45.748]  So that's part one of this.
[00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:49.330]  And Trump's trying to stop it.
[00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:57.254]  But heroin is cheaper, a dose of heroin is cheaper than a cup of coffee in Austin, Texas or Seattle, Washington.
[00:54:58.474 --> 00:54:58.815]  It's a fact.
[00:55:00.315 --> 00:55:06.539]  So when a dose of heroin is two or three dollars, and you get people on it, it's game over.
[00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:10.661]  And when cities tolerate it, and they tolerate the dealers,
[00:55:11.991 --> 00:55:13.412]  And they tolerate it being brought in.
[00:55:13.952 --> 00:55:14.712]  This is what happens.
[00:55:15.392 --> 00:55:16.373]  And your daughter gets on it.
[00:55:16.593 --> 00:55:17.393]  Your son gets on it.
[00:55:17.453 --> 00:55:18.674]  And their life's over.
[00:55:21.175 --> 00:55:22.095]  So that's what this is all about.
[00:55:22.115 --> 00:55:23.576]  And you take the police that told me.
[00:55:23.596 --> 00:55:24.896]  They said, yeah, we're really mad about this.
[00:55:25.376 --> 00:55:28.278]  We're ordered by the city not to stop this.
[00:55:28.338 --> 00:55:37.822]  We've got the footage of the drug dealers and their big Escalades staring at me with armed police like, what the hell are you doing here?
[00:55:37.862 --> 00:55:38.562]  We own this area.
[00:55:39.687 --> 00:55:41.948]  And I'm talking not even a block.
[00:55:42.508 --> 00:55:47.731]  The damn shantytown is less than 100 yards from the police station in L.A.
[00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:49.392]  And you drive all over L.A.
[00:55:49.452 --> 00:55:52.914]  and you see more shantytowns on underpasses and up on hills.
[00:55:53.034 --> 00:55:53.754]  It's everywhere.
[00:55:55.075 --> 00:55:56.556]  And they wonder why there's all the fires.
[00:55:56.576 --> 00:55:59.037]  Because the homeless burn fires during high winds.
[00:56:00.233 --> 00:56:03.895]  They inject heroin while their fire's going, and it burns down half the city!
[00:56:04.695 --> 00:56:06.756]  This is the leftist mentality.
[00:56:06.856 --> 00:56:07.897]  It's a demonic spirit.
[00:56:08.217 --> 00:56:08.737]  It's what they create.
[00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:11.439]  I'm going to come back before Bob Barnes joins us again in studio.
[00:56:11.459 --> 00:56:16.762]  I'm going to play a local LA report that's pretty powerful, but this is what they do.
[00:56:16.842 --> 00:56:17.582]  It's what they create.
[00:56:17.662 --> 00:56:21.564]  We're fighting to stop this, and red cities don't have this.
[00:56:23.085 --> 00:56:24.145]  It just doesn't happen.
[00:56:25.666 --> 00:56:28.628]  Because when it does pop up, people take it damn serious and care.
[00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:38.307]  Kind of like when multiple convicted pedophiles get caught running drag queen story times in Austin and Houston and everywhere else, we make a big deal about it.
[00:56:38.788 --> 00:56:41.551]  The media attacks us, de-platforms us, but guess what?
[00:56:41.591 --> 00:56:42.472]  Folks start getting arrested.
[00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:48.859]  Because we're the weirdos that think we shouldn't be taking kids into convicted pedophiles and having them sit on their laps.
[00:56:50.761 --> 00:56:51.982]  Especially when their parents don't get told.
[00:56:54.548 --> 00:56:55.849]  So that's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:55.869 --> 00:56:56.550]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:59.052]  Please do not forget, without you, we're not here.
[00:56:59.733 --> 00:57:04.437]  I keep saying it's the last day since Sunday, but I came up with new specials this morning.
[00:57:04.677 --> 00:57:12.504]  We'll have new great specials tomorrow, but the amazing specials we've had, the Memorial Day week sale, will end within the next 24 hours.
[00:57:14.406 --> 00:57:16.768]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:18.817 --> 00:57:19.857]  Takes you right to supplements.
[00:57:19.877 --> 00:57:23.398]  60 to 40% off these amazing products.
[00:57:23.478 --> 00:57:28.359]  And without you ordering the products like BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:57:28.399 --> 00:57:29.139]  Nobody else has that.
[00:57:29.499 --> 00:57:30.239]  We will not be here.
[00:57:30.639 --> 00:57:32.340]  All these products are the very best.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:37.461]  From Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste to X2 and X3 and RainForce Plus.
[00:57:37.701 --> 00:57:40.281]  All 40 to 60% off.
[00:57:40.701 --> 00:57:42.202]  So stock up on all that.
[00:57:42.262 --> 00:57:43.582]  Give it as a gift to friends and family.
[00:57:44.808 --> 00:57:45.629]  How about the red pill?
[00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.733]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:57:48.773 --> 00:57:49.234]  Stay with us.
[00:58:02.486 --> 00:58:06.748]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:58:06.848 --> 00:58:07.649]  They are technocrats.
[00:58:07.909 --> 00:58:10.030]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:17.494]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:18.414 --> 00:58:19.895]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:20.275 --> 00:58:22.417]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:22.917 --> 00:58:29.161]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:29.322 --> 00:58:30.082]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:58:30.562 --> 00:58:31.483]  I work a lot of hours.
[00:58:32.043 --> 00:58:37.027]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:58:37.667 --> 00:58:46.673]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:58:47.654 --> 00:58:53.337]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:53.657 --> 00:58:57.099]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[00:58:57.359 --> 00:59:00.901]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:02.782]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[00:59:03.462 --> 00:59:05.783]  This is the next level.
[00:59:05.843 --> 00:59:06.963]  This is Ultra 12.
[00:59:07.383 --> 00:59:13.284]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:13.524 --> 00:59:16.305]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[00:59:16.665 --> 00:59:17.285]  It tastes great.
[00:59:17.645 --> 00:59:18.966]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[00:59:19.266 --> 00:59:19.966]  It is amazing.
[00:59:20.226 --> 00:59:27.888]  Experience pure Methicobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[00:59:28.348 --> 00:59:33.994]  At InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:43.124]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're going to find anywhere, and it funds the InfoWar, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[00:59:43.364 --> 00:59:46.768]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[00:59:56.877 --> 01:00:00.845]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:12.102]  Devastating globalist lies.
[01:00:12.682 --> 01:00:16.323]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[01:00:17.023 --> 01:00:19.724]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption.
[01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:23.986]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:24.526 --> 01:00:26.266]  Transmitting worldwide.
[01:00:26.806 --> 01:00:28.087]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.943 --> 01:00:33.064]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:33.384 --> 01:00:35.024]  You are GO!
[01:00:35.124 --> 01:00:35.544]  We are GO!
[01:00:35.604 --> 01:00:39.945]  Launch 1776 Worldwide, which you're seeing happen.
[01:00:40.065 --> 01:00:40.445]  It's true.
[01:00:57.515 --> 01:01:02.897]  My plan, which was just a common sense plan, was adopted by the Patriots.
[01:01:03.197 --> 01:01:03.877]  Made perfect sense.
[01:01:04.377 --> 01:01:10.519]  Wasn't my plan, I just relaunched the plan that was already there, and the globalists don't like me for it, but hell, it doesn't matter, we're gonna win in the end.
[01:01:10.819 --> 01:01:16.321]  Let's go to this special report on the collapse of the Blue Cities, and then we'll get to Bob Barnes here in studio.
[01:01:18.038 --> 01:01:21.180]  It's a breeding ground for disease and fleas carrying typhus.
[01:01:21.641 --> 01:01:26.565]  Now the rats are living in mountains of trash left uncollected for weeks, even months.
[01:01:27.025 --> 01:01:36.893]  The mayor has promised to clean it up, but I-Team investigator Joel Grover found the city continues to ignore the growing garbage heaps, and that puts all of us at risk.
[01:01:38.413 --> 01:01:40.415]  You're getting a bird's eye view of L.A.'
[01:01:40.395 --> 01:01:42.497]  's most notorious trash pile.
[01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:48.082]  It's in downtown on Saris Avenue, right between the fashion and produce districts.
[01:01:48.683 --> 01:01:57.371]  Day and night, this spot and countless others are magnets for rats that could carry fleas infected with typhus and other diseases.
[01:01:58.172 --> 01:01:59.132]  I am so scared.
[01:01:59.252 --> 01:02:06.855]  Estella Lopez represents business owners who've complained to the city about the Ceres Avenue trash pile and others like it.
[01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:11.117]  I can't walk down the street without thinking that a flea could jump on me.
[01:02:11.457 --> 01:02:13.638]  This national survey now ranks L.A.
[01:02:13.738 --> 01:02:17.059]  as the second most rat-infested city in the nation.
[01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:23.081]  One reason, experts say, heaps of uncollected trash at hundreds of homeless encampments.
[01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:26.942]  Where people are literally living in piles of garbage.
[01:02:27.383 --> 01:02:32.705]  Like outside this supermarket and inside that mountain of filth on Saris Avenue.
[01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:34.646]  This is a breeding ground for typhus.
[01:02:34.966 --> 01:02:36.406]  I'm disgusted by it personally.
[01:02:36.666 --> 01:02:41.629]  We first told Mayor Garcetti about that Saris Avenue health hazard last October.
[01:02:41.929 --> 01:02:45.010]  Our responsibility is to make sure the trash doesn't even accumulate in the first place.
[01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.251]  That shouldn't have happened and we're going to make sure it doesn't.
[01:02:47.913 --> 01:02:51.156]  Right after that interview, the city did clear away the trash here.
[01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:57.782]  But month after month since then, we've been watching, and the filth has been piling up once again.
[01:02:57.802 --> 01:03:01.686]  I want to report a huge trash pile at 800 Saris Street.
[01:03:02.006 --> 01:03:05.790]  And even a call to 311... Hello, this is Mayor Eric Garcetti.
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:08.032]  ...couldn't get the city to act fast.
[01:03:08.212 --> 01:03:10.294]  You're saying it could take up to 90 days to clean it up?
[01:03:10.794 --> 01:03:21.276]  Inefficient system for collecting rotting garbage and the I team has learned the city has no program to control the growing rat population that feasts on all that trash.
[01:03:22.297 --> 01:03:27.878]  Other big cities like New York and Washington have entire teams devoted to rat control.
[01:03:28.818 --> 01:03:34.939]  This DC crew is even experimenting with bait stations laced with a new rat contraceptive.
[01:03:35.099 --> 01:03:37.620]  The traditional methods that we use
[01:03:38.937 --> 01:03:39.937]  Doesn't work.
[01:03:40.557 --> 01:03:42.638]  You know, so we need something else.
[01:03:42.898 --> 01:03:44.438]  We have so many rats.
[01:03:44.598 --> 01:03:45.958]  Pepe Garcia of L.A.'
[01:03:45.918 --> 01:03:47.218]  's Sanitation Bureau.
[01:03:47.399 --> 01:03:50.059]  Shouldn't the city be doing some kind of rodent control?
[01:03:50.299 --> 01:03:51.539]  It's something that we'll look into.
[01:03:51.779 --> 01:03:53.960]  But some say there's no time to waste.
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:58.480]  Like UCLA infectious disease doctor Jeffrey Klausner, who says L.A.'
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.402]  's trash and rat problem ranks right up there with the worst slums he's seen in the third world.
[01:04:05.062 --> 01:04:06.862]  Trash and food waste attracts rats.
[01:04:07.202 --> 01:04:14.687]  Klausner warns that rats spread not only typhus, but also dangerous strains of salmonella and even bubonic plague.
[01:04:14.707 --> 01:04:15.668]  I am so worried.
[01:04:15.908 --> 01:04:20.772]  Worried because rats carrying typhus-infected fleas were found around L.A.
[01:04:20.832 --> 01:04:25.075]  last fall, according to Health Department emails obtained by the I-Team.
[01:04:26.215 --> 01:04:29.599]  The I-Team has learned that fleas found on some animals at L.A.'
[01:04:29.559 --> 01:04:33.222]  's North Central Shelter tested positive for typhus.
[01:04:33.523 --> 01:04:42.292]  As the summer flea season looms and the garbage heaps grow, so does concern that an even bigger disease outbreak could hit L.A.
[01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:43.653]  in the months ahead.
[01:04:43.673 --> 01:04:44.654]  This is serious.
[01:04:45.175 --> 01:04:47.297]  People get very violently sick.
[01:04:47.337 --> 01:04:48.659]  This is unacceptable.
[01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:58.805]  We asked Mayor Garcetti to speak with us about that trash pile on Ceres Avenue and about the growing epidemic threat, but he declined to sit down with us.
[01:04:59.365 --> 01:05:02.710]  His spokesman told us we could find him at a public event.
[01:05:04.338 --> 01:05:15.340]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:24.002]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[01:05:24.262 --> 01:05:28.283]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:05:28.943 --> 01:05:35.312]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[01:05:35.412 --> 01:05:37.515]  And you may be experiencing back-up too.
[01:05:37.595 --> 01:05:43.483]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:46.126]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[01:05:46.787 --> 01:05:56.654]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[01:05:57.174 --> 01:06:02.138]  So go to InfowarsStore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[01:06:09.329 --> 01:06:10.910]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:11.251 --> 01:06:17.556]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:26.384 --> 01:06:31.409]  You know, lost in all the news is the fact that it's admitted
[01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:44.462]  That Obama and Kerry and the Democrats and deep staters have been undermining US policy for Iran and trying to sabotage Trump's
[01:06:45.745 --> 01:06:48.807]  Political operations, which is the definition of treason.
[01:06:49.308 --> 01:06:51.009]  You add that to pushing open borders.
[01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:53.490]  You add that to trying to overthrow the president.
[01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:59.975]  You add that to this whole constellation of trying to sell us out on trade to China, and it's called treason.
[01:07:00.215 --> 01:07:01.256]  Well, they're the Democrats.
[01:07:01.616 --> 01:07:02.697]  America was never great.
[01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:03.638]  It'll never be great.
[01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:06.320]  They are the party that's been selling the nation out.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:13.024]  Their blue cities are collapsing into piles of rats and typhoid and black plague and TB.
[01:07:14.086 --> 01:07:15.903]  But here is just a little piece of the treason.
[01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:26.998]  In a shocking new report today, we are now learning that former members of the Obama administration have been caught holding back-channel communications with Iranian officials on how to defeat U.S.
[01:07:27.038 --> 01:07:29.259]  foreign policy under the Trump administration.
[01:07:30.059 --> 01:07:34.961]  Specifically, they've been contacting Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif.
[01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:45.206]  One American News exposed John Kerry's illegal shadow diplomacy with Zarif last year, when the two were caught holding secret meetings together in Paris, and photos were taken of them.
[01:07:45.786 --> 01:07:48.047]  Kerry's deep ties to Zarif are well known.
[01:07:48.827 --> 01:07:55.369]  In some cases, Obama officials reportedly attended Capitol Hill meetings to learn information about new U.S.
[01:07:55.409 --> 01:08:00.911]  policies from Congressional Democrats, and then relayed that information to the Iranian government.
[01:08:01.291 --> 01:08:08.133]  This, of course, is in violation of the Logan Act, the same act that General Flynn was spied upon after Trump had been elected.
[01:08:08.953 --> 01:08:16.460]  Obama officials are desperate to rebuild the Iran nuclear deal that Trump dropped, and they are working with their allies in Congress to complete it.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:36.176]  All of this comes at a time when the Trump administration has been successful in isolating Iran from many of its European allies and trading partners, and now in some cases is even seeming to isolate Iran from Syria and Russia by pulling Hezbollah fighters out of Syria and Russia rejecting Iran's offer to purchase a major air defense system from Moscow.
[01:08:36.896 --> 01:08:37.357]  The U.S.
[01:08:37.377 --> 01:08:46.823]  has also labeled the Iranian Revolutionary National Guard a terrorist force and sent military equipment to the Middle East with escalating tensions against the Islamic Republic.
[01:08:47.503 --> 01:08:59.271]  To be clear, the fact that former Obama officials are holding shadow diplomacy with Iran and possibly passing them information from allies in Congress to undermine U.S.
[01:08:59.311 --> 01:09:03.294]  foreign policy is shocking and must be investigated by A.G.
[01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:04.435]  Barr immediately.
[01:09:05.035 --> 01:09:06.256]  Let that sink in.
[01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:09.079]  For One American News, I'm Jack Posobiec.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:17.548]  Oh, it just so happens Jack Posobiec, as everybody knows, has a pipeline directly to the White House every day, writing reports for him.
[01:09:17.568 --> 01:09:19.149]  He just so happens to be Naval Intelligence as well.
[01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:24.976]  They are not happy at this point because there is a wind on down the road, my friends.
[01:09:27.159 --> 01:09:31.725]  Alright, Bob Barnes, attorney at law, riding shotgun again with us today, doing a great job.
[01:09:32.446 --> 01:09:40.637]  Bill Barr, the attorney general, we've got some more clips we played yesterday, some more clips we're going to get to, because I was asking, there's so much happening with the censorship, global government.
[01:09:41.687 --> 01:09:42.628]  All the things that are happening.
[01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:04.669]  And the way they try to turn this around shows they're not going away.
[01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:06.229]  They're not going to quit.
[01:10:06.589 --> 01:10:06.989]  Oh, no doubt.
[01:10:07.029 --> 01:10:18.872]  I think what was key with what Barr did yesterday on CBS in his interview, parts of which got leaked at different times last week, was to send the message that he will be completely unaffected by every form of attack that they could make.
[01:10:18.892 --> 01:10:20.452]  He said he doesn't care about his legacy.
[01:10:20.472 --> 01:10:21.592]  He doesn't care about his reputation.
[01:10:21.612 --> 01:10:22.493]  He doesn't care about his life.
[01:10:22.813 --> 01:10:23.113]  Exactly.
[01:10:23.133 --> 01:10:23.773]  He doesn't care about anything.
[01:10:23.793 --> 01:10:24.753]  He said, I'll be dead soon.
[01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:25.353]  Exactly.
[01:10:25.773 --> 01:10:26.554]  And we all die.
[01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:28.694]  Everybody dies, as he put it famously.
[01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:35.679]  So he doesn't care about having a, he doesn't want to be a Homer hero where they're singing songs and lyrics about him centuries later.
[01:10:35.939 --> 01:10:47.467]  What matters to him is doing what's right now by the country and its democratic institutions now and that requires taking out the deep state operatives that tried to do this illicit coup and misuse and abuse state power.
[01:10:47.487 --> 01:10:53.992]  And all the CBS reporters and the person in the interview, because I ended up watching the whole thing actually before we did the live show, they were shaken by it.
[01:10:54.352 --> 01:10:56.715]  Because everybody gets that they all know what they did.
[01:10:56.775 --> 01:10:58.076]  They all know they got talking points.
[01:10:58.396 --> 01:11:05.364]  They all know the Obama CIA stayed behind and went and met with everybody from, you know, from Moby to Hollywood to CBS.
[01:11:05.384 --> 01:11:06.565]  They all got walking orders.
[01:11:06.866 --> 01:11:07.646]  Trump's a Russian.
[01:11:07.867 --> 01:11:09.008]  He's an illegitimate government.
[01:11:09.188 --> 01:11:09.749]  The real U.S.
[01:11:09.769 --> 01:11:11.591]  government's under Obama and Hillary's control.
[01:11:11.811 --> 01:11:12.752]  He'll be gone soon.
[01:11:13.032 --> 01:11:13.993]  But he never was gone.
[01:11:14.253 --> 01:11:15.575]  And now they know they were lied to.
[01:11:15.615 --> 01:11:16.436]  They're freaking out.
[01:11:16.696 --> 01:11:17.096]  Oh, no doubt.
[01:11:17.136 --> 01:11:21.578]  I mean, that whole thing was sort of almost an inquisitive interview as much as it was anything else.
[01:11:21.898 --> 01:11:23.559]  It was, won't you be affected by this?
[01:11:23.859 --> 01:11:24.979]  Won't you be affected by this?
[01:11:25.159 --> 01:11:25.819]  Aren't you scared?
[01:11:26.099 --> 01:11:26.500]  Exactly.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.200]  Aren't you scared that we'll destroy your legacy?
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.201]  Aren't you scared that we'll wreck your ability to make money?
[01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:32.442]  He's like, you had a great life.
[01:11:32.482 --> 01:11:33.362]  You were respected.
[01:11:33.802 --> 01:11:34.783]  What's your problem?
[01:11:35.243 --> 01:11:36.423]  They're so disconnected.
[01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:40.985]  Like when Pele, who lost his job a month later, was sitting there with Jack Posobiec.
[01:11:41.925 --> 01:11:42.866]  No, it wasn't Jack Posobiec.
[01:11:44.286 --> 01:11:45.527]  I had Jack Masovic on the mind.
[01:11:45.587 --> 01:11:48.088]  It was popping my mind here in just a second.
[01:11:48.348 --> 01:11:50.410]  The Gorilla Mind guy, the lawyer out in California.
[01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.990]  Oh, Cernovich.
[01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:51.830]  Yeah, Mike Cernovich.
[01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:53.912]  He's on with Mike Cernovich for Teleprompter Free, folks.
[01:11:53.952 --> 01:11:55.172]  I gotta think of names sometimes.
[01:11:55.913 --> 01:11:59.475]  And he says, but Hillary's camp said she was totally healthy and didn't fall down.
[01:12:00.575 --> 01:12:03.356]  And he said, but why would you believe the Democratic Party on their talking points?
[01:12:04.136 --> 01:12:08.858]  And he laughs back at Cernovich, again, thinking it's all a confidence game.
[01:12:09.099 --> 01:12:13.560]  It's all, I'm in the suit, I'm CBS anchor, you don't question me, the sky's red.
[01:12:13.761 --> 01:12:14.201]  Oh, exactly.
[01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:16.242]  I mean, it's people who are completely accustomed.
[01:12:16.602 --> 01:12:23.565]  You saw a reaction to Barr by CBS, and now you're seeing it radioactive throughout the press and their reaction and what they're talking about writing today.
[01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:26.486]  The same reaction that you saw them react to Trump.
[01:12:27.046 --> 01:12:28.387]  Like, I mean, aren't you going to apologize?
[01:12:28.447 --> 01:12:29.188]  Aren't you going to fold?
[01:12:29.268 --> 01:12:31.050]  Aren't you going to realize that you can't do this?
[01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.311]  Don't you realize we'll destroy you economically?
[01:12:33.752 --> 01:12:35.313]  Don't you realize we'll wreck your reputation?
[01:12:35.353 --> 01:12:37.795]  Don't you realize we'll defame you and libel you until the end of days?
[01:12:38.216 --> 01:12:39.196]  And Trump was like, I don't care.
[01:12:39.216 --> 01:12:40.057]  I'm going to go forward.
[01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:41.398]  And Barr did the exact same thing.
[01:12:41.578 --> 01:12:42.299]  Barr said, I don't care.
[01:12:42.339 --> 01:12:47.003]  All the things you think you can use against me, I already knew you were going to try to use against me.
[01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:48.524]  And I'm going to be unaffected by it.
[01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:53.168]  The globalists, the social engineers, thought they'd intimidated America and broken our back.
[01:12:53.228 --> 01:12:54.770]  But collectively, we were really asleep.
[01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:55.530]  Thank you.
[01:13:11.218 --> 01:13:17.040]  They don't get that once you cross a Rubicon or an event horizon, it's a point of no return.
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.361]  It's really spiritual in my view.
[01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:21.802]  That as a man, you just click in and it's over.
[01:13:22.062 --> 01:13:24.263]  No matter what they do, you're going to keep on the attack.
[01:13:24.503 --> 01:13:26.724]  In fact, the more they attack, the more you know you're right.
[01:13:27.004 --> 01:13:32.566]  And I think that's what's freaking them out, is they're using the old intimidation tactic of old that they thought was working.
[01:13:32.586 --> 01:13:33.607]  No, we were asleep.
[01:13:35.067 --> 01:13:39.870]  The most analogous I see to this is the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:49.116]  So from 1870 to 1950, intimidation tactics worked to keep people from asserting their civil rights, particularly in the South, in the African American community.
[01:13:49.577 --> 01:13:55.621]  And then what happened is all of a sudden you had people recognized like Medgar Evers, who said the biggest fear is fear itself.
[01:13:56.081 --> 01:14:02.523]  That if you forfeit the fear of what bad outcome might come about, then you actually seize the power and have the upper ground.
[01:14:02.903 --> 01:14:03.803]  That's what King did.
[01:14:04.243 --> 01:14:07.224]  That's what all the civil rights marchers did.
[01:14:07.504 --> 01:14:11.546]  They forfeited the fear of the bad actions that might come to them by taking action.
[01:14:11.566 --> 01:14:16.287]  And by doing so, they ended up with not only the moral power, but the real power.
[01:14:16.587 --> 01:14:18.029]  And that's what Barr and Trump have been doing.
[01:14:18.069 --> 01:14:18.749]  And that's what Barr did.
[01:14:18.769 --> 01:14:24.216]  Barr was like, all the things you think will motivate me, or deter me, or discourage me, or dissuade me, will not.
[01:14:24.576 --> 01:14:30.863]  Because I've forfeited the fear of what can happen to my reputation, what can happen to my legacy, what can happen to me financially.
[01:14:33.746 --> 01:14:39.169]  Stuff's so screwed up, and the deep state's so out of control, I gotta do this because you guys are gonna cause a giant civil war.
[01:14:39.369 --> 01:14:39.689]  Exactly.
[01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:45.593]  He cares more about the legacy of the American democracy than he does his own personal individual reputation or history.
[01:14:45.953 --> 01:14:47.273]  He's like an old school soldier.
[01:14:47.754 --> 01:14:49.214]  An old school patriot.
[01:14:49.595 --> 01:14:51.616]  And that's what's shocking all of them.
[01:14:51.656 --> 01:14:59.260]  They're realizing that he's not only sincere, but they have all the tools and mechanisms they thought they had, they do not have to restrain him from going forward.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.940]  That he's going to march forward no matter what.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:05.801]  And yet, people like Schiff and Mueller's whole pitch was, hey, use impeachment as the counter-threat.
[01:15:06.121 --> 01:15:10.742]  And instead, what you had today was Schiff coming out and saying, oh, that'd be a waste of time because the Senate will never impeach anyone.
[01:15:10.762 --> 01:15:11.962]  We'll look like a bunch of idiots.
[01:15:12.443 --> 01:15:15.003]  So all of a sudden, they realized they have no more cards left to play.
[01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:17.443]  That now it's just going to be an onslaught.
[01:15:18.084 --> 01:15:22.184]  It's literally like unleashing Godzilla and not having any resistance available to you.
[01:15:22.544 --> 01:15:24.925]  And that's what effectively what Barr sent the signal up.
[01:15:25.385 --> 01:15:45.296]  And Bar, and Trump, and Infowars, and all of us, from little folks like us up at the top, we're all launching attacks this summer, politically, legislatively, legally, and all of us, whether you call into C-SPAN, or you go to a city council meeting and speak, or whether you buy some products at InfowarsStore.com, or whether you go and speak to your PTA meeting, all of you launch your political attacks on the left,
[01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:45.996]  Oh.
[01:16:06.869 --> 01:16:12.334]  I'm here in my parents' kitchen because my house flooded with torrential rains this week.
[01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:15.797]  So the flooded part of the house, they're having to fix that, so I'm staying over here.
[01:16:17.059 --> 01:16:23.685]  And I looked in my parents' cupboard and found that they were stocked up on some of the M4's Life products.
[01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:24.485]  And I thought, wait a minute.
[01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:31.110]  I've been thinking about coming over to their house because their kitchen is nicer than mine and shooting a video about how amazing these products are.
[01:16:31.631 --> 01:16:34.753]  So I called Drew, one of our great camera people over at InfoWars this morning.
[01:16:35.353 --> 01:16:40.537]  I said, hey, why don't you meet me over here and I'm going to shoot a video I've been meaning to do for probably a year.
[01:16:40.617 --> 01:16:41.858]  So I'm like, I've got everything right here.
[01:16:43.146 --> 01:16:44.687]  It's time to show you what I personally do.
[01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.268]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:16:47.128 --> 01:16:56.454]  When I remember to take the supplements religiously, I lose weight, I'm healthy, my skin gets great, I have better stamina, libido, energy.
[01:16:57.134 --> 01:16:58.155]  I've never been a supplements guy.
[01:16:58.175 --> 01:17:02.457]  A lot of my big sponsors were supplement people, and I thought, well, why don't I try these then?
[01:17:02.797 --> 01:17:03.818]  And it turned out they were really good.
[01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:07.380]  So we came out, as you know, six years ago with our own line of supplements.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.761]  We've been expanding it ever since.
[01:17:08.781 --> 01:17:10.142]  And what we do is,
[01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:17.767]  Set out to already find what's the highest rated, already find what's the cleanest, what's the best, and then make it better, and then cut the price.
[01:17:18.347 --> 01:17:19.948]  And that's what we've done with these products.
[01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:30.135]  And that's why InfoWars live products are so highly rated by third-party sites, that's why they're so popular with you, and it's also great because it funds our political operations, trying to stop the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:36.258]  I always start taking the supplements and then I forget to take them.
[01:17:36.278 --> 01:17:41.999]  I either run out or I just get busy and then all of a sudden I'm not taking DNA Force.
[01:17:42.459 --> 01:17:44.180]  All of a sudden I'm not taking X2.
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.860]  I'm not taking Secret 12.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:58.363]  That's why it's important for everybody out there that already knows they got great results with these high quality products and InfoWars Life or other supplements you've been taking to remember how good they were for you and your family and to get back into it.
[01:17:58.923 --> 01:18:06.326]  So today I just wanted to encourage everybody that's gotten great results with these products to just remember that because I need that reminder as well.
[01:18:06.847 --> 01:18:13.110]  One of the biggest things is I tend to go to the warehouse and get some of the products out for myself and then those run out and I forget.
[01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:15.491]  So now what I do, what my parents do,
[01:18:16.511 --> 01:18:31.496]  And other people I know is they just put it on auto ship and then fullwarslive.com get an additional 10% off and then you don't forget each month or every two months how much you want to have it shipped to you to get the product, support the show, and of course also get 10% off.
[01:18:32.036 --> 01:18:38.758]  Now some of the things I do is I don't really like soft drinks because they got so much sugar in them and I already have a problem with sweets sometimes.
[01:18:39.518 --> 01:18:41.219]  So I really like soft drinks.
[01:18:41.239 --> 01:18:41.939]  What I'm proud to say is
[01:18:42.799 --> 01:18:44.081]  I don't like the effects they have on me.
[01:18:44.682 --> 01:18:51.193]  So what I do is take something like a Perrier, lime or non-flavored, and I put it into a nice glass.
[01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:56.481]  And then I take the Ultra 12
[01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:03.314]  And put in a whole dropper, and then I stir it up, and the flavor is incredible.
[01:19:03.774 --> 01:19:18.665]  So again, take your favorite sparkling water that doesn't have any calories in it, either flavored or unflavored, it all goes great with the flavor of natural vitamin B12 that has a sweet taste without any sugar or additives.
[01:19:18.685 --> 01:19:24.609]  You've got to experience Ultra 12 for yourself, you've got to experience X2 as well, and of course, X3.
[01:19:24.729 --> 01:19:26.431]  That's triiodine.
[01:19:27.131 --> 01:19:28.432]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:19:28.852 --> 01:19:34.035]  Bottom line, these are all incredible products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[01:19:34.455 --> 01:19:42.320]  As I've said over and over again, it funds an organization dedicated to exposing the globalists and their operations.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.821]  That's why I thank you all for your support.
[01:19:43.841 --> 01:19:46.502]  I want to encourage you, if you haven't tried these products, to try them.
[01:19:46.522 --> 01:19:48.564]  And if you have tried them and, again, forgot,
[01:19:49.344 --> 01:19:51.064]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:33.366]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.386 --> 01:20:41.253]  45 had this to say yesterday before he jumped on that big old jet airplane to fly over to the UK.
[01:20:43.812 --> 01:20:46.835]  There is no basis whatsoever for impeachment.
[01:20:47.355 --> 01:20:47.575]  None.
[01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:49.137]  There was no collusion.
[01:20:49.297 --> 01:20:50.558]  There was no obstruction.
[01:20:50.818 --> 01:20:51.819]  There was no crime.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.901]  The crime was by the Democrats.
[01:20:54.341 --> 01:20:56.483]  The crime was by the Democrats.
[01:20:56.864 --> 01:21:00.267]  There is no legal basis for impeachment.
[01:21:00.627 --> 01:21:01.628]  It's a big winch hunt.
[01:21:01.988 --> 01:21:04.190]  Everybody knows it, including the Democrats.
[01:21:08.021 --> 01:21:11.304]  Trump ran for office for the first time in his life and became the president of the U.S.
[01:21:11.964 --> 01:21:12.885]  The guy's incredible.
[01:21:13.205 --> 01:21:15.547]  You cannot deny the stamina, the energy.
[01:21:16.047 --> 01:21:20.691]  I'm 45, and I get exhausted now by like 3 or 4 o'clock.
[01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:24.714]  I can go rest and stuff and get back to work later, but Trump is amazing.
[01:21:24.794 --> 01:21:25.495]  It's a godsend.
[01:21:25.535 --> 01:21:27.557]  And I'm not groveling at Trump.
[01:21:27.577 --> 01:21:30.499]  I'm very thankful to God and the universe.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.364]  And I was getting back to this before we get back to Bill Barr, the Attorney General, and the amazing things happening.
[01:21:38.054 --> 01:21:41.495]  With Bob Barnes, your constitutional lawyer, who's been up in D.C.
[01:21:41.515 --> 01:21:42.776]  a lot, has his ear to the ground.
[01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:46.937]  Earlier, I wanted your take on this, then we'll play these clips.
[01:21:47.798 --> 01:22:02.182]  Do you agree with me that the country was kind of asleep, and things go through those periods of sleep, but now there's this period of awakening, and the establishment in Hollywood and the politically correct, they keep trying to bully to keep us in line.
[01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:04.743]  They thought the bullying is why they were in power before.
[01:22:05.264 --> 01:22:06.284]  It was because we were asleep.
[01:22:07.662 --> 01:22:16.404]  And it's their intense bullying that's actually awakening people and stealing, hardening their defiance to their tyranny.
[01:22:16.684 --> 01:22:18.385]  And I just can't believe they haven't figured it out yet.
[01:22:18.925 --> 01:22:23.766]  I mean, they are accustomed to a mindset where people just react and do what they want them to do.
[01:22:24.186 --> 01:22:29.187]  So I think that's happened ever since really starting the 80s and the 90s, particularly on college campuses, happened in the 90s.
[01:22:29.447 --> 01:22:33.448]  But the media, particularly the very young, overwhelmingly share the same ideology.
[01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:35.809]  They're accustomed from the time they're in high school.
[01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:37.510]  That they get what they want.
[01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:54.559]  If they want to sort of blackmail someone effectively into going along with their ideas, whether it's through peer pressure in high school or college, whether it's the university regulators and administrators, or once they're in the media, they just threaten, hey, we'll ruin you financially, we'll ruin your reputation, we'll ruin your life, unless you go along with us.
[01:22:54.579 --> 01:23:03.583]  So what it is, it's an arrested development psychology of a nation of babies, but real men are returning, where it's about the chivalry and the honor and the commitment.
[01:23:03.623 --> 01:23:04.524]  It's not about what you do to me.
[01:23:04.864 --> 01:23:05.284]  Precisely.
[01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:08.907]  And they don't even know how to deal with someone who has that mentality.
[01:23:09.547 --> 01:23:11.709]  They have no idea how to react to a mindset.
[01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:18.974]  Will Chamberlain had a piece in Human Events, of which he's a publisher, where they're bringing back human events in the old Reagan-esque mode that it used to be.
[01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:23.637]  And his whole point was you have these peacetime conservatives, quote-unquote, who are just wusses at heart.
[01:23:23.697 --> 01:23:24.597]  They're the Romney types.
[01:23:24.778 --> 01:23:25.798]  They're the McCain types.
[01:23:25.858 --> 01:23:26.999]  They always appease.
[01:23:27.019 --> 01:23:29.040]  They want to be friends with the corporate media.
[01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.102]  Well, that's why you're a loser, Romney.
[01:23:31.142 --> 01:23:34.044]  The corporate media doesn't have power except over weenies.
[01:23:34.364 --> 01:23:34.824]  Exactly.
[01:23:34.884 --> 01:23:36.885]  And his whole point is we need wartime conservatives.
[01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:42.748]  And that's a mindset of patriots, chivalry, old-school ideas, Sinatra-style, Trump-style.
[01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:43.148]  I love that!
[01:23:43.188 --> 01:23:44.869]  We need wartime conservatives.
[01:23:45.049 --> 01:23:45.529]  Precisely.
[01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:52.472]  People with a mindset and a mentality that recognizes that we're at a war, and in order to win that war, you have to forfeit all fear.
[01:23:52.592 --> 01:23:53.673]  Almost like an Infowar?
[01:23:54.193 --> 01:23:54.593]  Exactly.
[01:23:55.253 --> 01:23:58.514]  Forfeit fear of what they can do to you personally, what they can do to you professionally.
[01:23:58.854 --> 01:24:03.676]  I mean, for example, just when I took on this case, there was at least a half dozen hit pieces on me.
[01:24:03.996 --> 01:24:04.816]  So that's just the norm.
[01:24:04.836 --> 01:24:07.577]  They're accustomed to that having the effect of deterring people.
[01:24:07.597 --> 01:24:09.177]  And they tried to take you off the case and failed.
[01:24:09.197 --> 01:24:13.619]  You didn't make a big deal about that, but that's a big deal to say you don't have speech about Sandy Hook.
[01:24:13.879 --> 01:24:15.019]  If you represent me, shut up.
[01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:15.759]  Oh, exactly.
[01:24:15.979 --> 01:24:17.820]  Or that I couldn't speak about free speech in general.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:23.044]  I mean, the idea and the goal was to have a sort of a one-sided gag order, effectively.
[01:24:23.344 --> 01:24:26.167]  And so it is, and usually that deterrence works.
[01:24:26.247 --> 01:24:30.670]  This deterrence of where the press comes out and does a hit piece on you, like, well, I'm scared to give a hit piece.
[01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:43.140]  You see it, like, for example, there's a good piece by Kurt Schlichter as well in Town Hall, where he's talking about these sort of peacetime conservatives, these sort of wuss conservatives, who keep wanting, who won't even have people that have been blacklisted on their TV shows.
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:45.002]  Won't have people that have been blacklisted by big
[01:24:45.342 --> 01:24:48.004]  And they don't get it as they're giving into the wave that will crush them.
[01:24:48.224 --> 01:24:48.684]  Exactly.
[01:24:49.024 --> 01:24:57.249]  There's no way to be, just as there's no way to be halfway pregnant, there's no way to be halfway in bed with the Stassi-style mode of operations of big tech and big media.
[01:24:57.469 --> 01:24:58.250]  That just can't happen.
[01:24:58.290 --> 01:25:00.251]  You're either fighting them, or you're rolling over.
[01:25:00.711 --> 01:25:01.732]  And you're forfeiting.
[01:25:01.892 --> 01:25:03.353]  I don't know why people don't get this.
[01:25:03.493 --> 01:25:14.056]  I mean, when you're being told you can't say somebody's name on Facebook like Alex Jones, and you're being told you can't say that there's only two genders, if there were more than two genders, which of course there aren't, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:14.096 --> 01:25:15.517]  You have a damn right to do it.
[01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:19.178]  That's a clear and present, incredible danger.
[01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:23.559]  A cult of control freaks, the likes of which the world's never seen.
[01:25:23.819 --> 01:25:25.400]  Obviously, they must be opposed.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.741]  Absolutely, no doubt about it.
[01:25:26.761 --> 01:25:27.261]  Not a piece!
[01:25:27.402 --> 01:25:41.573]  You see people like AOC on Twitter yesterday talking about how Big Tech needs to make sure that they have a quote-unquote healthy conversation and make sure that they get rid of these people causing fake news or disinformation.
[01:25:41.593 --> 01:25:49.159]  So she can say America sucks and cauliflower is racist and the world's ending in 12 years and then we can't counter her, a public figure.
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.282]  The most unprotected person out there is a public figure.
[01:25:52.342 --> 01:25:53.343]  A child is protected.
[01:25:53.923 --> 01:26:00.268]  A public figure, lady, you are, not just in a man's world, you are in the damn gladiatorial arena.
[01:26:00.308 --> 01:26:06.553]  You climbed in there, with Mike Tyson, and then you want him tied up in the corner so you can piss on him.
[01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:07.293]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:26:07.714 --> 01:26:08.214]  Oh, precisely.
[01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:10.676]  And it shows the mindset and the mentality of these people.
[01:26:11.016 --> 01:26:15.697]  So you see it now, like with YouTube launching, claiming they're going to investigate Steven Crowd.
[01:26:16.097 --> 01:26:16.417]  What is it?
[01:26:16.537 --> 01:26:17.578]  Oh yeah, here's that article.
[01:26:17.858 --> 01:26:23.359]  In fact, I went and looked at the video that's being flagged by this Vox guy that called for us to be taken down, and it's like he's God or something.
[01:26:23.659 --> 01:26:26.520]  And it goes, well Vox says you made fun of me, I'm gay.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:28.980]  They didn't even do that, but so what if they did?
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.701]  You know, it's I'm queer, I'm here, and if you talk about me, I'll sue you.
[01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:33.702]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:34.182 --> 01:26:43.771]  It's the same mindset, well for example Axios did an interview with Jared Kushner where they were back on the idea that any criticism of Obama concerning where he was born was racist.
[01:26:44.091 --> 01:26:46.673]  But in fact that originated as a criticism of John McCain.
[01:26:46.713 --> 01:26:48.595]  That didn't originate as a criticism of Obama.
[01:26:48.835 --> 01:26:52.619]  And the criticism of Obama originated from the Clinton camp within the Democratic process.
[01:26:52.959 --> 01:26:54.340]  Not anybody on the Republican side.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.342]  Just like Hillary created the whole birth certificate thing.
[01:26:56.502 --> 01:26:56.762]  Exactly.
[01:26:56.782 --> 01:26:58.663]  It's creating immunity based on status.
[01:26:59.043 --> 01:27:03.725]  It's okay if I'm African-American, or if I'm woman, or if I'm gay, if I'm disabled.
[01:27:04.025 --> 01:27:05.606]  Suddenly you can't talk about me at all.
[01:27:05.626 --> 01:27:06.686]  Then you're a protected group.
[01:27:07.027 --> 01:27:08.667]  But only if you have the right ideas.
[01:27:08.787 --> 01:27:13.229]  I investigated this Vox guy, hops around going, I'm queer, I'm queer.
[01:27:13.889 --> 01:27:17.011]  And then so Crowder says, okay, well the self-described queer.
[01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:19.712]  Now he goes, oh no, only I can say I'm queer.
[01:27:20.172 --> 01:27:21.553]  You can't use the magic word.
[01:27:21.793 --> 01:27:23.093]  It's literally thought police.
[01:27:23.153 --> 01:27:24.134]  It's pathetic!
[01:27:24.774 --> 01:27:27.055]  And Crowder's not exactly a radical, dramatic guy.
[01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.397]  He's in the Mark Dice sort of comedic school of conservative thought.
[01:27:30.617 --> 01:27:33.439]  He's not out there really doing anything that controversial at all.
[01:27:33.739 --> 01:27:38.461]  And if he's being targeted by Google's YouTube, then you get a sense of what the problem is.
[01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:40.982]  They're just moving on to the next person.
[01:27:41.202 --> 01:27:41.403]  Yes.
[01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:43.904]  Because they need to stand up for Alex Jones and then Paul Watson.
[01:27:44.304 --> 01:27:45.985]  Paul Watson, a hate figure.
[01:27:46.476 --> 01:27:47.336]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:47.376 --> 01:27:50.518]  Someone too dangerous to allow in the public arena.
[01:27:50.878 --> 01:27:54.640]  And it's using that sort of language and that sort of lingo and that sort of approach.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:28:03.504]  They just have a mindset that's a collectivist mindset that's rooted in weakness in terms of their ideas and actually confidence and belief in their ideas.
[01:28:03.524 --> 01:28:06.606]  And what they are is incredible authoritarians and they're in these bubbles.
[01:28:07.466 --> 01:28:08.927]  Where they think you shouldn't have speech.
[01:28:08.967 --> 01:28:11.390]  I mean, you're filed on in court saying you don't have speech.
[01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:12.291]  Just shut up!
[01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:13.131]  Exactly.
[01:28:13.151 --> 01:28:19.317]  It's a mindset that they've grown up in a safe space culture that produces... that they think a hip piece and a smear piece will work.
[01:28:19.337 --> 01:28:23.541]  That's why it gets... I mean, when you have... By the way, the Vox guy, he's been working for years to get Crowder off air.
[01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:24.402]  He helped get us off.
[01:28:24.642 --> 01:28:26.103]  And so he's assaulting Crowder.
[01:28:26.403 --> 01:28:31.208]  This is a big... Crowder does nothing back, and he goes, well, I haven't gotten you taken down, so you're attacking me.
[01:28:31.488 --> 01:28:33.530]  This is a big tech, big media collusion.
[01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:36.252]  Oh yeah, this guy got $200 million to run Vox.
[01:28:37.033 --> 01:28:39.975]  I mean, that's how much money... And Vox is still losing money.
[01:28:39.995 --> 01:28:41.457]  Vox is not doing well at all.
[01:28:41.477 --> 01:28:43.178]  And that's why they want Crowder off.
[01:28:43.458 --> 01:28:43.819]  Exactly.
[01:28:43.859 --> 01:28:48.443]  They want big tech, big media to collude to stop the audience from getting to choose what new interviews they have.
[01:28:48.463 --> 01:28:51.846]  As if that's still going to give you an audience if you take us all off, you morons.
[01:28:52.066 --> 01:28:54.828]  It's going to get your asses busted up in the antitrust action.
[01:28:55.469 --> 01:28:58.952]  But, just wait, you authoritarian dirtbags.
[01:29:07.904 --> 01:29:26.734]  The United States has been the apple of the world's eye for 244 years because our electoral system fused ancient Roman, ancient Greek, ancient Judaic law, ancient British common law systems from the Iroquois Federation in the Northwest into Canada.
[01:29:26.814 --> 01:29:27.755]  That is the system.
[01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.376]  It had checks and balances.
[01:29:29.876 --> 01:29:31.357]  It didn't allow for dictators.
[01:29:32.017 --> 01:29:34.018]  It didn't allow for too much concentration of power.
[01:29:34.238 --> 01:29:40.120]  And what were you going to do if the North of the United States had three times the population of the South?
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:43.041]  A bit geographically, the South was much larger.
[01:29:43.161 --> 01:29:53.344]  You didn't want to have the majority of the North be able to set all the laws for the South because you'd just be replacing King George III with Northern voters.
[01:29:54.304 --> 01:29:56.725]  It's called the tyranny of the majority.
[01:29:57.862 --> 01:30:04.166]  In a classic democracy, if 51% vote to kill you, it happens.
[01:30:04.486 --> 01:30:11.571]  Actually, in ancient Greece, when they had original pure democracy in one particular city-state, they had black stones for no, white stones for yes.
[01:30:11.831 --> 01:30:14.453]  And only the gentry elite could vote, but it was a pure democracy.
[01:30:14.573 --> 01:30:17.495]  And if they didn't like what you said, there was no judge or jury.
[01:30:17.575 --> 01:30:18.495]  There was the people's jury.
[01:30:18.576 --> 01:30:23.819]  And they would put rocks in the bucket and kill you, and you would be thrown off a cliff or given hemlock.
[01:30:23.999 --> 01:30:27.582]  And most of the famous philosophers actually were ordered to kill themselves.
[01:30:27.742 --> 01:30:29.023]  That was, of course, Athens.
[01:30:29.243 --> 01:30:31.925]  You might want to look into pure democracy.
[01:30:32.706 --> 01:30:34.967]  51% said, kill somebody?
[01:30:35.308 --> 01:30:37.489]  You are double dead.
[01:30:38.210 --> 01:30:43.114]  Now, we have a constitutional republic, or a liberal democracy.
[01:30:43.134 --> 01:30:46.076]  So, imagine you're somebody in Wyoming.
[01:30:46.176 --> 01:30:48.978]  You only get three members of the House of Representatives.
[01:30:49.218 --> 01:30:50.779]  California, how many do they have?
[01:30:50.799 --> 01:30:51.120]  50-something?
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:52.040]  It's an incredible number.
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:52.781]  Look it up, I forget.
[01:30:52.961 --> 01:30:56.265]  The point is, is that Wyoming gets two senators and so does California.
[01:30:56.325 --> 01:30:57.866]  It's a beautiful check and balance.
[01:30:58.107 --> 01:31:04.434]  So see, in the House, you get represented by population, but there's a check and a balance in case things get out of control in the House.
[01:31:05.095 --> 01:31:09.399]  Then there's a power of veto by the fact that your rural state
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.302]  Still has those two senators.
[01:31:11.842 --> 01:31:20.872]  And previous to the 17th Amendment from 1913, the same day we got the Federal Reserve, same day we got the IRS, our new system, they took the senators away.
[01:31:21.012 --> 01:31:25.798]  The senators weren't just a check on the House, they were a check on the executive.
[01:31:26.038 --> 01:31:28.020]  Senators were from the state.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:31.504]  So that you have 50 states in a confederation, 13 states at that time,
[01:31:31.664 --> 01:31:37.168]  And they foresaw a civil war if you could have the tyranny of the majority vote away the rights of others.
[01:31:37.248 --> 01:31:40.231]  And that kind of still happened with the Civil War that came up in the 1860s.
[01:31:40.331 --> 01:31:41.452]  So our system isn't perfect.
[01:31:41.492 --> 01:31:46.996]  And so you don't want two or three states in a popular vote being able to presidentially outvote everybody else.
[01:31:47.176 --> 01:31:49.338]  But getting rid of the Electoral College goes far beyond that.
[01:31:49.538 --> 01:32:00.146]  It completes what the globalists tried to do in 1913 with the Federal Reserve and the 17th Amendment, where senators used to be elected by the House or the legislature in their state.
[01:32:00.206 --> 01:32:00.867]  Let me explain that again.
[01:32:01.007 --> 01:32:10.145]  They would have votes in the state legislatures over who their senator was they were going to send so that it was a federal office.
[01:32:11.530 --> 01:32:20.416]  But it was a creature of the state giving the state direct veto power into the Senate in case those senators got bought off.
[01:32:20.996 --> 01:32:24.258]  So checks and balances inside checks and balances.
[01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:28.181]  The world envy of the planet.
[01:32:28.741 --> 01:32:32.784]  The closest to perfection you're going to find.
[01:32:33.104 --> 01:32:33.905]  No one has denied it.
[01:32:34.765 --> 01:32:36.406]  Easy to rig parliamentary systems.
[01:32:37.026 --> 01:32:38.206]  Easy to rig other systems.
[01:32:38.566 --> 01:32:39.646]  Very hard to rig this one.
[01:32:40.127 --> 01:32:44.228]  And that's why they want to get rid of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:44.348 --> 01:32:45.308]  And they're very close.
[01:32:45.448 --> 01:32:46.168]  They're very close.
[01:32:46.188 --> 01:32:48.649]  They've gotten most of the blue wall states to pass it.
[01:32:48.769 --> 01:33:00.052]  And then we'll have the tyranny, just like in science fiction, you know, movies out there, where you've got the different districts, and the one big powerful district, like in Hunger Games, rules all the others, because it has the big population.
[01:33:05.931 --> 01:33:12.116]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.561 --> 01:33:28.448]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:29.168 --> 01:33:30.670]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:34.332]  Longing for the sun to welcome.
[01:33:35.851 --> 01:33:52.707]  It was last year that the Islamic Caliphate commando, Sadiq Khan, who literally has said women should cover themselves up in London, who covers up the knife attacks, works for the jihadis, said that Trump shouldn't be allowed into the UK.
[01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:53.888]  What an authoritarian.
[01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:55.370]  What a monster.
[01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:58.933]  Well, here's some of his comments about Trump just today.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:12.964]  President Trump, if you're watching this, your values and what you stand for are the complete opposite of London's values and the values in this country.
[01:34:13.224 --> 01:34:16.125]  We think diversity is not a weakness, diversity is a strength.
[01:34:16.265 --> 01:34:19.046]  We respect women and we think they're equal to men.
[01:34:19.066 --> 01:34:24.649]  We think it's important to safeguard the rights of all of us, particularly the vulnerable and the marginalised.
[01:34:25.089 --> 01:34:28.090]  When you are the President of the USA, you have a massive leadership role.
[01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:29.691]  You have a massive platform as well.
[01:34:29.731 --> 01:34:30.912]  People follow what you do.
[01:34:31.052 --> 01:34:36.034]  What we've seen over the last few years in the USA is a rolling back of much of the progress made in previous decades.
[01:34:36.654 --> 01:34:38.455]  It's really important we continue to move forwards.
[01:34:38.775 --> 01:34:43.638]  What we've seen in the USA is a rolling back of the reproductive rights of women.
[01:34:43.798 --> 01:34:50.701]  We've got a situation now where some states in the USA are making it almost impossible for women to have the rights to have an abortion.
[01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:56.964]  One has to look at the history books to realize the consequences of women not having the right to choose over their own body.
[01:34:56.984 --> 01:34:59.746]  What we can't afford to do is return to backstreet abortions.
[01:34:59.846 --> 01:35:05.769]  What we can't afford to see is a return to the situation in yesterdecades, where you had women having no control over their bodies.
[01:35:05.789 --> 01:35:08.391]  It's really important we support women in the USA.
[01:35:08.871 --> 01:35:11.353]  The fight for gender equality... I'm done.
[01:35:11.373 --> 01:35:11.793]  Fight it out.
[01:35:12.293 --> 01:35:15.936]  So you can have acid attacks on women in England, all over the world exploding.
[01:35:15.956 --> 01:35:17.858]  You can have their genitals being cut off.
[01:35:18.298 --> 01:35:18.939]  You can have all this.
[01:35:18.959 --> 01:35:27.947]  He's an Islamistist, but then he's this leftist like AOC and Ilhan Omar at the same time praising Venezuela, praising all of it.
[01:35:28.087 --> 01:35:34.753]  And again, cancel Donald Trump's state visit, says Sadiq Khan at her London attack tweets, pointing out they were Islamic attacks.
[01:35:36.054 --> 01:35:37.536]  So this guy's a real authoritarian.
[01:35:37.856 --> 01:35:39.037]  Well, yeah, no doubt about that.
[01:35:39.077 --> 01:35:45.039]  I mean, also you have the sort of rape gangs that were being covered up that sort of outraged so many people in the United Kingdom.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.762]  It's sort of really what put Tommy Robinson on the map more publicly was the fact that that had been covered up.
[01:35:51.142 --> 01:35:54.304]  So you have, I mean, I think the president's description of Khan is very good.
[01:35:54.324 --> 01:35:56.845]  He's, you know, that he's basically de Blasio, but a lot shorter.
[01:35:57.646 --> 01:35:58.286]  That's very apt.
[01:35:58.706 --> 01:36:00.167]  That's who Khan is.
[01:36:00.207 --> 01:36:02.249]  He's an inept and ineffective mayor.
[01:36:02.509 --> 01:36:06.072]  His main primary job was to keep the city secure, keep the city safe.
[01:36:06.452 --> 01:36:07.393]  That has badly failed.
[01:36:07.413 --> 01:36:12.917]  They've had a wave of knife attacks throughout the city that have been unsolved and unresolved.
[01:36:12.937 --> 01:36:16.800]  When I was there just in November and December, there was heightened security concerns.
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:22.464]  I was talking to people that were old-school leftists throughout the city, and they were very bothered by what was happening.
[01:36:22.544 --> 01:36:24.406]  They were bothered by the degree of Islamophobia.
[01:36:24.426 --> 01:36:25.307]  Well, John Cleese is leaving.
[01:36:25.327 --> 01:36:26.447]  There's an exodus out.
[01:36:27.388 --> 01:36:37.073]  And why everywhere the left controls things do cities suddenly degenerate to giant piles of rats and fleas and knife attacks and acid attacks and people defecating everywhere?
[01:36:37.333 --> 01:36:38.654]  It's just not an effective model.
[01:36:38.874 --> 01:36:41.175]  In other words, it's much like statism and communism.
[01:36:41.316 --> 01:36:43.477]  I mean, with statism it just failed, sooner or later.
[01:36:43.757 --> 01:36:53.162]  Statism in the form of fascism failed, statism in the form of communism failed, and statism in the form of sort of backdoor politics and mediocre political machine politics.
[01:36:53.542 --> 01:36:59.765]  It's not like old school machine politics in the in the 1900s in the United States, where you really had the working class tied into governmental control.
[01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:04.568]  This is the professional class running these cities, and they just fail completely and abysmally.
[01:37:04.688 --> 01:37:12.312]  And we've got the junior senator from Missouri shooting up the ranks, pointing out that the right wing needs to stop being elitist.
[01:37:12.712 --> 01:37:15.174]  These are more populist like Trump, but beyond Trump,
[01:37:15.774 --> 01:37:27.422]  We need to really get back to average people and jobs and our country itself and not worshipping the establishment, not parlaying America into some larger global vision of America hating elites.
[01:37:27.462 --> 01:37:28.503]  That's the truth.
[01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:29.923]  It's very popular.
[01:37:30.264 --> 01:37:32.405]  It's a pro-human future and we need to adopt it.
[01:37:32.725 --> 01:37:33.166]  Oh, no doubt.
[01:37:33.626 --> 01:37:43.172]  I think a lot of the attacks on the InfoWars audience is because the InfoWars audience was at the tip of the spear for the political revolution that we've seen now all across the United States and Western Europe.
[01:37:43.192 --> 01:37:45.494]  By the way, you were ahead of some lawsuits and things.
[01:37:46.014 --> 01:37:48.695]  Have been doing some big demographic studies with top firms.
[01:37:49.115 --> 01:37:51.476]  Why don't you tell folks what we found about the InfoWars audience?
[01:37:51.496 --> 01:37:51.836]  Sure.
[01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:55.737]  The InfoWars audience has a strong overlap with Trump's original core audience.
[01:37:56.158 --> 01:37:58.598]  It's disproportionately populist-oriented audience.
[01:37:58.918 --> 01:38:03.000]  An audience that had frequently checked out of American politics.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:09.362]  And so the fact that the InfoWars audience re-engaged... People that knew it was controlled, who've now activated it again because they know it's on.
[01:38:09.682 --> 01:38:10.062]  Exactly.
[01:38:10.082 --> 01:38:13.465]  They saw in Trump the capacity to make a meaningful difference again.
[01:38:13.885 --> 01:38:17.668]  And so they re-engaged in the political process and re-engaged across the board.
[01:38:17.708 --> 01:38:21.812]  What it really is is smart Americans that knew what was going on are back in the game because now...
[01:38:22.987 --> 01:38:23.987]  It's a little bit more level.
[01:38:24.248 --> 01:38:25.788]  Yeah, they now actually have a real voice.
[01:38:26.148 --> 01:38:29.770]  I mean, disproportionately, this was an audience that recognized that their voice was not being listened to.
[01:38:30.190 --> 01:38:30.930]  You had the elites.
[01:38:31.130 --> 01:38:36.432]  You basically had a competition between whether big government or big corporations run your life prior to Trump.
[01:38:36.772 --> 01:38:41.394]  It was very much economic elites ran the Republican Party, cultural elites ran the Democratic Party.
[01:38:41.694 --> 01:38:43.475]  Both of them were against middle America.
[01:38:43.515 --> 01:38:46.076]  Both of them were propagating stupid and foolish wars.
[01:38:46.576 --> 01:38:47.117]  We're good to go.
[01:39:07.919 --> 01:39:24.688]  Until Trump came on the scene and through your audience was able to connect to ordinary Americans in a unique and revolutionary way and create a basically overturn the entire deep state apparatus and win an election against the most institutionally corrupt candidate maybe in American history.
[01:39:24.708 --> 01:39:25.769]  And by the way,
[01:39:27.392 --> 01:39:28.794]  She was supposed to be the winner.
[01:39:28.854 --> 01:39:31.857]  They printed hundreds of thousands of Madam President and put this out.
[01:39:31.897 --> 01:39:32.918]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:39:32.938 --> 01:39:46.993]  But even when Trump won, the deep state, the bureaucracy, continued to operate as if she and Obama, and to a certain extent like Joe Biden, are these triple heads of this dragon that we're actually still fighting.
[01:39:47.453 --> 01:39:51.436]  No doubt, because they had so much control within the administrative part of government.
[01:39:51.496 --> 01:39:54.318]  The old construct of the deep state is simply a dual state.
[01:39:54.659 --> 01:39:59.562]  You have all these administrative hacks who control the everyday operation of government against the elected branch.
[01:39:59.902 --> 01:40:07.148]  And so you had all these people that were underneath Trump who were daily undermining Trump in embassies around the world, within the State Department, within the Justice Department.
[01:40:07.408 --> 01:40:08.429]  That's why they put Mueller in place.
[01:40:08.449 --> 01:40:09.309]  So you're a smart guy.
[01:40:09.329 --> 01:40:11.071]  I want to hit a bunch of others as we come back.
[01:40:11.831 --> 01:40:16.095]  As their power runs out, as they know they're losing, as Trump goes on the offense,
[01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:17.357]  I don't know.
[01:40:36.747 --> 01:40:40.468]  Even if the economy gets bad, hey, Trump went to bat, we're in a fight.
[01:40:40.848 --> 01:40:42.709]  So when you're in a fight, you might get your nose broken.
[01:40:43.009 --> 01:40:43.409]  But you know what?
[01:40:43.429 --> 01:40:44.570]  You're going to win the fight in the end.
[01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:48.391]  I think the globals keep going, you want all your money, kind of like Bill Barr.
[01:40:48.671 --> 01:40:50.211]  You know, we could ruin your life.
[01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:51.752]  He's like, you already are ruining it.
[01:40:52.092 --> 01:40:52.992]  I didn't want to have to do it.
[01:40:53.072 --> 01:40:54.713]  It's because you're such a thug, I've got to do this.
[01:40:55.053 --> 01:40:57.434]  They don't get like, we're ready to get our nose broken.
[01:40:57.654 --> 01:40:59.174]  We're ready to get arms and legs broken.
[01:40:59.474 --> 01:41:00.215]  We don't want it.
[01:41:00.275 --> 01:41:04.236]  But believe me, while they're trying to break our nose politically, they're going to get their brains bashed out.
[01:41:04.736 --> 01:41:12.363]  The, and I think as a whole, their first option is impeachment, but the problem with impeachment is as Schiff admitted today, they're going to lose in the Senate, so it'll just be a waste of time and effort.
[01:41:12.804 --> 01:41:13.104]  Exactly.
[01:41:13.124 --> 01:41:14.205]  So the walls are closing in.
[01:41:14.225 --> 01:41:15.366]  What are they going to do?
[01:41:15.526 --> 01:41:19.570]  The next option is what they are doing, is trying to invade the privacy of the President.
[01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:22.352]  Anybody connected to the President with these invasive subpoenas.
[01:41:22.613 --> 01:41:23.033]  But the U.S.
[01:41:23.053 --> 01:41:25.976]  Supreme Court should step in at some point and stop that from happening.
[01:41:26.276 --> 01:41:30.380]  So once that doesn't happen, they no longer have any legitimate power left.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.143]  So you're going to see sabotage efforts undermining the North Korean peace process.
[01:41:34.404 --> 01:41:39.048]  You have people wishing and hoping that the economy collapse like Bill Maher talked about some time ago.
[01:41:39.328 --> 01:41:40.129]  That's going to come back.
[01:41:40.409 --> 01:41:44.573]  You're going to see probably more celebration of Antifa and street violence to encourage it and invite it.
[01:41:44.593 --> 01:41:45.494]  It's going to be street violence.
[01:41:45.914 --> 01:41:50.477]  You're going to see a continuous effort to sort of scapegoat the political right and the populist right.
[01:41:50.757 --> 01:41:52.558]  It's already happening in certain intellectual circles.
[01:41:52.598 --> 01:42:01.143]  So there's a publication called Quillette that was established to be sort of a cross-heterodox intellectual academic publication for people outside of the progressive left.
[01:42:01.664 --> 01:42:10.969]  But they're already writing hit pieces on Dave Rubin and other people solely for the purposes of purging the populist, the national populist wing of the intellectual wing from their publications.
[01:42:11.289 --> 01:42:12.250]  So they're already trying to do that.
[01:42:14.111 --> 01:42:16.553]  They're going to keep attacking people's reputations.
[01:42:16.573 --> 01:42:19.195]  They're going to keep attacking people economically.
[01:42:19.215 --> 01:42:20.696]  They're going to continue to attack people in the judiciary.
[01:42:20.716 --> 01:42:24.259]  The deep state has continued to leak against the president, but they are on the back foot.
[01:42:37.409 --> 01:42:59.245]  They have the low ground, the president has the high ground, and with a general like Barr, he has the meaningful ability to make meaningful change, and if we ride that tailwave, we can reinstate... I agree, but we need Soros watched, we need the Young Turks watched, we need that Antifa leadership watched, because they're going to use Antifa as the decoys for the real paramilitary attack on the president and their American Republic reboot leadership.
[01:43:03.021 --> 01:43:07.524]  I don't know if you were happy that day, but I read on your Facebook page you were getting a vaccination.
[01:43:07.564 --> 01:43:08.225]  You were singing.
[01:43:08.505 --> 01:43:19.392]  A PhD immunologist and vaccine proponent recently admitted during a conference that babies are only given shots up to age one in order to train the parents to get their children into the medical system.
[01:43:19.432 --> 01:43:21.514]  That the vaccines are completely worthless.
[01:43:21.874 --> 01:43:33.908]  The notion that babies are being injected with vaccines in the first year of their life simply in order to brainwash parents into feeding their children into the medical system is an extremely disturbing premise.
[01:43:34.288 --> 01:43:37.872]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:43:37.952 --> 01:43:41.296]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official
[01:43:41.596 --> 01:43:42.817]  InfoWars app.
[01:43:42.937 --> 01:43:44.058]  And here's the best part.
[01:43:44.078 --> 01:43:45.779]  It is absolutely free.
[01:43:45.939 --> 01:43:50.662]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWar today.
[01:43:50.882 --> 01:43:54.544]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app app.
[01:43:54.564 --> 01:43:56.185]  It's the InfoWars official app.
[01:43:56.425 --> 01:43:58.387]  Taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:43:58.587 --> 01:44:02.749]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:03.530]  Space Force.
[01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:06.412]  Deep, deep, deep, deep Space Force.
[01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:24.010]  We made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:29.234]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[01:44:29.254 --> 01:44:35.959]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with InfoWars.com.
[01:44:36.099 --> 01:44:42.004]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify, I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:48.682]  Get your order first.
[01:44:48.862 --> 01:44:52.643]  InfoWars4.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:45:12.503 --> 01:45:16.764]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:45:16.884 --> 01:45:17.665]  They are technocrats.
[01:45:17.945 --> 01:45:20.045]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:45:20.646 --> 01:45:27.528]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:45:28.428 --> 01:45:29.909]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:32.431]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:45:32.932 --> 01:45:39.197]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:45:39.357 --> 01:45:40.097]  And I'm not perfect.
[01:45:40.578 --> 01:45:41.498]  I work a lot of hours.
[01:45:42.059 --> 01:45:47.063]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:45:47.703 --> 01:45:56.690]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:45:57.671 --> 01:46:03.354]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter you're going to find anywhere.
[01:46:03.454 --> 01:46:07.116]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[01:46:07.376 --> 01:46:10.918]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[01:46:11.578 --> 01:46:12.799]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[01:46:13.459 --> 01:46:15.801]  This is the next level.
[01:46:15.861 --> 01:46:16.982]  This is Ultra 12.
[01:46:17.402 --> 01:46:23.307]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:46:23.548 --> 01:46:26.330]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:27.311]  It tastes great.
[01:46:27.671 --> 01:46:28.992]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[01:46:29.292 --> 01:46:29.993]  It is amazing.
[01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:37.920]  Experience pure Methocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:43.401]  At Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:44.182 --> 01:46:53.124]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're going to find anywhere, and it funds the Infowar, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[01:46:53.384 --> 01:46:56.785]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[01:47:06.798 --> 01:47:09.539]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.479 --> 01:47:10.959]  Ooh, babe.
[01:47:10.999 --> 01:47:15.361]  Ooh, babe.
[01:47:15.441 --> 01:47:16.541]  Ooh, babe.
[01:47:16.581 --> 01:47:21.023]  Cosmo's gonna help you.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:36.341]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:37.282 --> 01:47:38.423]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:40.004 --> 01:47:42.065]  Bob Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is riding a shotgun with us.
[01:47:42.085 --> 01:47:44.047]  We're going to get into the big enchilada here in a moment.
[01:47:44.948 --> 01:47:47.850]  What made Trump finally announce antitrust probes?
[01:47:48.850 --> 01:47:52.894]  A big tech that's already lost him $137 billion since it was announced a few days ago.
[01:47:52.914 --> 01:47:56.136]  We're going to cover that here in a moment and the next stage of this.
[01:47:56.816 --> 01:47:59.719]  Yeah, American farmers are going to get hurt by the trade war with China.
[01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:03.127]  Other industries could be hurt, but we're finally standing up.
[01:48:03.187 --> 01:48:03.768]  We're in a fight.
[01:48:03.828 --> 01:48:04.668]  We've been in a war.
[01:48:05.148 --> 01:48:07.089]  We've been getting our ass kicked for 40 years.
[01:48:07.209 --> 01:48:08.290]  It stops now.
[01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:11.191]  But the left's like, you can get your nose bloody.
[01:48:11.872 --> 01:48:12.812]  You can get your arm broken.
[01:48:12.932 --> 01:48:13.973]  We already know that.
[01:48:14.773 --> 01:48:17.995]  And so stop telling us all day how we got our ass kicked.
[01:48:18.435 --> 01:48:19.656]  All it does is piss us off.
[01:48:21.316 --> 01:48:24.878]  I can't wait to see what the leftists do when they lose, because you can smell the fear.
[01:48:25.258 --> 01:48:26.179]  You can smell the defeat.
[01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:29.012]  You can also smell the hubris still.
[01:48:29.052 --> 01:48:30.734]  They've been doubling down forever and winning.
[01:48:32.075 --> 01:48:35.518]  Listeners, the only reason we're on air is because of you.
[01:48:35.638 --> 01:48:36.699]  You are incredible.
[01:48:36.839 --> 01:48:37.660]  You are amazing.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.320]  I salute you.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:38.921]  I thank you.
[01:48:40.022 --> 01:48:42.144]  But we really make it easy to support the broadcast.
[01:48:42.384 --> 01:48:44.706]  One of the only true independent media operations in the world.
[01:48:45.566 --> 01:48:47.088]  Vox gets $200 million a year.
[01:48:51.226 --> 01:48:59.608]  To go out and police the internet, and ban conservatives, and ban nationalists, and ban Christians, and ban gun groups, and ban veteran groups, and they're just treated as if they're God.
[01:49:01.029 --> 01:49:08.171]  In the last four years since HBO bought it, Vice has been given over five billion dollars.
[01:49:09.431 --> 01:49:12.812]  Five billion dollars.
[01:49:13.172 --> 01:49:16.753]  Hundreds and hundreds of millions extra a year just from Soros to keep them afloat.
[01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:20.456]  Despite that, they're going bankrupt.
[01:49:20.476 --> 01:49:21.216]  They're collapsing.
[01:49:21.256 --> 01:49:22.237]  No one's watching it.
[01:49:22.477 --> 01:49:27.358]  No one wants to watch the head of Apple tell us what a big liberal he is.
[01:49:27.778 --> 01:49:32.420]  No one wants the dime-a-dozen liberal trendies to hop around and talk about how they're oppressed.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.200]  You're not oppressed.
[01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:34.481]  We're not even looking at you.
[01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.441]  You're so damn boring.
[01:49:36.622 --> 01:49:37.682]  People want authentic.
[01:49:37.722 --> 01:49:38.682]  They want Americana.
[01:49:39.022 --> 01:49:40.383]  They want the real thing.
[01:49:40.943 --> 01:49:41.663]  Even if it's ugly.
[01:49:42.064 --> 01:49:43.004]  They want real.
[01:49:44.158 --> 01:49:48.119]  They keep trying to figure out what the magic sauce is, the secret sauce, dumbasses.
[01:49:48.179 --> 01:49:49.300]  I'm almost the audience.
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.400]  I'm almost the leftist.
[01:49:51.741 --> 01:49:53.941]  It's that people want the real McCoy.
[01:49:54.982 --> 01:49:56.802]  So we make it easy to support the broadcast.
[01:49:56.842 --> 01:49:59.923]  We've got one of the biggest sales in a long time that must end today.
[01:50:00.244 --> 01:50:01.444]  I promise you it's gone tomorrow.
[01:50:01.824 --> 01:50:02.944]  Less than 24 hours left.
[01:50:03.225 --> 01:50:04.525]  We're announcing some new specials tomorrow.
[01:50:05.685 --> 01:50:12.988]  This new special is 60 to 40% off all of our best-selling supplements.
[01:50:14.502 --> 01:50:18.525]  And I'm just going to tell you this again.
[01:50:20.286 --> 01:50:21.828]  We don't compete with drugs.
[01:50:22.728 --> 01:50:23.869]  Drugs compete with us.
[01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:27.852]  And there are a lot of amazing drugs and a lot of good pharmaceuticals, a lot of bad ones.
[01:50:28.393 --> 01:50:30.034]  There's a lot of great cars, a lot of bad cars.
[01:50:30.054 --> 01:50:32.376]  A lot of great women, a lot of bad women.
[01:50:32.836 --> 01:50:34.698]  A lot of great houses, a lot of bad houses.
[01:50:34.718 --> 01:50:37.120]  A lot of great sunsets, a lot of ugly sunsets, you know?
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.261]  If you're a woman, a lot of great men, a lot of bad men.
[01:50:41.463 --> 01:50:42.704]  But the point is, is that
[01:50:44.065 --> 01:50:52.010]  Infowars can sell $40 million worth of product, and we don't mark up products five, six times.
[01:50:52.091 --> 01:50:54.012]  We put real value into it.
[01:50:54.612 --> 01:51:01.497]  In fact, I was just in a meeting three days ago on Saturday, and I said, how did this happen?
[01:51:02.558 --> 01:51:04.319]  And they said, you said put the very best in it.
[01:51:06.787 --> 01:51:13.573]  And the market research guy, we're finally getting into marketing, said, yeah, but the average, you know, multi-pack, two dose a day thing is like $35.
[01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:17.696]  And we've, we learned maybe $5 of products in the whole thing.
[01:51:17.856 --> 01:51:19.057]  And the box costs a dollar.
[01:51:19.457 --> 01:51:22.460]  So that's like $6, but you put, you put $25 into the eight pack power stack.
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.300]  $25 for the pills alone.
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.541]  These are highest in,
[01:51:33.732 --> 01:51:35.975]  And then our marketing guy, who's a smart guy, bitched at me.
[01:51:36.015 --> 01:51:39.538]  He said, Hey, you barely talked about it because it's not selling.
[01:51:40.179 --> 01:51:41.601]  And it's our new flagship product.
[01:51:42.842 --> 01:51:46.887]  That's AM and PM, 13 different pills, four new formulas.
[01:51:47.827 --> 01:51:51.089]  And then the other basic vitamins that supercharge it.
[01:51:51.729 --> 01:51:53.850]  And I'm like, I don't have time to get into it.
[01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:57.292]  You know, it's got 100% reviews right now for people that have researched it.
[01:51:57.312 --> 01:52:04.356]  But no, I can't sell it for $30 like leading competitors because there's $25 in product.
[01:52:04.576 --> 01:52:08.258]  And I bought a million dollars of it that comes in over the next year.
[01:52:09.755 --> 01:52:12.619]  This is one of the top three manufacturers in the country.
[01:52:12.639 --> 01:52:15.623]  Because we go to the highest-end manufacturers to have our stuff done.
[01:52:15.904 --> 01:52:17.246]  Obviously, we want the highest-end for you.
[01:52:17.586 --> 01:52:18.948]  Plus, we know we're targets to get tested.
[01:52:20.610 --> 01:52:23.534]  So we test it after they do all the testing, so that jacks the price up even more.
[01:52:23.554 --> 01:52:25.077]  I forgot, testing on top of $25 a box.
[01:52:28.996 --> 01:52:30.756]  And I'm telling you, nobody does that, folks.
[01:52:31.237 --> 01:52:37.798]  The highest end stuff out there might have $5 a product in it, and vitamins that God gave us are so incredible that it'll do good for you.
[01:52:38.378 --> 01:52:39.378]  This has $25 in a box!
[01:52:39.438 --> 01:52:41.199]  That's what it cost me!
[01:52:41.219 --> 01:52:41.199]  $25!
[01:52:41.519 --> 01:52:42.699]  So yes, at $59.95, that's 50% off.
[01:52:55.046 --> 01:52:56.547]  So I'm not going to belabor this all day.
[01:52:56.587 --> 01:52:59.708]  I'm just going to tell you, we've got the best products, period.
[01:53:01.769 --> 01:53:04.029]  And we're proud of them.
[01:53:05.670 --> 01:53:08.811]  And I go to these companies and I tell them, put the best in there.
[01:53:08.851 --> 01:53:10.232]  And then later I turn back and I go,
[01:53:11.462 --> 01:53:12.703]  Maybe I should have put $10 in there.
[01:53:12.723 --> 01:53:13.945]  That would have been better than anybody else.
[01:53:13.985 --> 01:53:16.007]  Then I'd charge $30 and make money and we're great.
[01:53:16.848 --> 01:53:17.648]  It's a philosophy.
[01:53:18.049 --> 01:53:21.813]  I don't have cold-blooded, scientific manipulation like everybody else.
[01:53:21.933 --> 01:53:23.234]  I just go with my red blood.
[01:53:24.055 --> 01:53:26.237]  And that's where I'm at in this.
[01:53:26.978 --> 01:53:29.881]  But these specials end tomorrow, and they're amazing.
[01:53:30.362 --> 01:53:31.463]  And the 8-pack Power Stack...
[01:53:32.853 --> 01:53:38.176]  Is what gets people to habituate, like myself, to put it in your lunchbox and then have it at home before you go to bed at night.
[01:53:38.696 --> 01:53:40.678]  The AM and PM, two different packets, two a day.
[01:53:41.318 --> 01:53:44.780]  Because then you don't forget to take it, which is the biggest problem for people like me and you.
[01:53:46.007 --> 01:53:47.588]  I'm really proud of the 8-pack power stack.
[01:53:47.628 --> 01:53:53.850]  I don't have an hour to go through the four new formulas and all the rest of it, but it's amazing and I appreciate your support.
[01:53:54.511 --> 01:53:55.771]  Not much time left in this segment.
[01:53:55.791 --> 01:54:01.134]  We've got this segment on the next before our next guest joins us, Bob Barnes, Attorney at Law.
[01:54:01.854 --> 01:54:10.658]  Getting into the inside baseball, your meetings at CPAC, your meetings in DC, my similar meetings that confirm
[01:54:12.142 --> 01:54:13.843]  We've been telling people Trump's about to go on the offense.
[01:54:14.903 --> 01:54:23.007]  You were getting into the fact that the last straw really was Facebook banning certain names in certain terms.
[01:54:23.047 --> 01:54:26.828]  That really pushed Trump over the edge and now Human Events is riding on it.
[01:54:27.689 --> 01:54:29.310]  It's now being confirmed by Bloomberg.
[01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:30.090]  You want to talk about this?
[01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:32.331]  This is pretty big to show Trump's thinking.
[01:54:32.611 --> 01:54:33.892]  Just to show how real he is.
[01:54:34.172 --> 01:54:34.472]  Exactly.
[01:54:34.572 --> 01:54:39.094]  In other words, had they simply not made the choice to ban your name from their platforms,
[01:54:39.634 --> 01:54:45.416]  And had not made the choice to try to go after and censor people saying anything positive about Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[01:54:46.036 --> 01:54:48.417]  It would not have led to the antitrust investigation.
[01:54:48.937 --> 01:54:57.181]  And just the announcement of the investigation, and the possibility it was going to go into Facebook as well, cost them $137 billion.
[01:54:57.701 --> 01:55:01.742]  That's how much money was lost by Big Tech by choosing to go after you.
[01:55:01.842 --> 01:55:06.424]  That's how much the President cost them just by announcing the possibility of an investigation.
[01:55:07.925 --> 01:55:25.160]  $137 billion collectively lost across big tech in less than a day, solely because they decided to come after you, not recognizing that the president was going to stand by his audience, was going to stand by his people, and was going to stand by the original principles of free speech and free press that govern and guide this country.
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:27.861]  And because of it, now they've lost tons of money.
[01:55:28.121 --> 01:55:47.849]  So ultimately, don't be surprised if coming down the pipeline will be stockholder actions that may be part of an ongoing, that may be part of a whole set of litigation coming up this summer to sort of ride the tailwave of what is happening, the tailwinds of what is happening by the President and to go behind what Attorney General Barr is doing.
[01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:51.031]  And notice they tried to spin it, oh, YouTube's the reason this happened.
[01:55:51.111 --> 01:55:51.291]  No.
[01:55:51.631 --> 01:55:56.474]  It's because you're spying, you're selling data, you're censoring people, you got caught lying to Congress.
[01:55:56.914 --> 01:55:58.135]  That's why you're in trouble.
[01:55:58.615 --> 01:56:12.483]  And you're only going to get in more trouble because you've abused your monopoly, which monopolists always do, and you've worked with other monopolies to form combines and cartels and oligopolies, which they always, in their final phase, cartels form out of the monopolies.
[01:56:13.044 --> 01:56:14.545]  But it's just so amazing that
[01:56:15.427 --> 01:56:23.949]  They can't stop, and they won't back down because Google even had press conferences internally to their members saying, oh my God, Hillary lost, we won't let this happen again.
[01:56:24.309 --> 01:56:24.850]  Right, exactly.
[01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:27.730]  I mean, all they had to do is hear the president meets with Jack at Twitter.
[01:56:28.090 --> 01:56:38.593]  There's all these problems that had already been documented by that point, saying, look, just pull back, don't meddle in the election, don't continue to suppress and censor speech, and they would have been able to save their stockholders over $100 billion.
[01:56:39.213 --> 01:56:39.814]  But they refused.
[01:56:40.094 --> 01:56:44.395]  They decided they're going to go after... Oh, they're now spinning it because we cut off the fake news, we lost money.
[01:56:44.955 --> 01:56:48.536]  No, it's because your censoring and antitrust investigations have been opened up on you.
[01:56:48.657 --> 01:56:49.117]  Precisely.
[01:56:49.357 --> 01:56:53.338]  There would be no antitrust investigation if they weren't engaged in any antitrust illicit activity.
[01:56:53.658 --> 01:57:12.006]  When they decided to go from just being a technological monopoly on a platform, and instead be a technological monopoly on speech, on press, and on elections, they made a decision that was a fateful decision that has now cost them billions of dollars, will cost them billions of dollars more in the future, and now they're under major antitrust investigation, and it's not going to stop at Google.
[01:57:12.026 --> 01:57:12.886]  It's going to keep going.
[01:57:13.086 --> 01:57:22.957]  And it's going to expand to Facebook, it's going to expand to other operating... And again, they've been riding high since the 80s, where we said, leave it alone, let it grow so we dominate globally.
[01:57:23.358 --> 01:57:28.984]  But as soon as Apple and Google said, screw America, familiarity breeds contempt.
[01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:31.267]  We love the Chinese, we want to work with the Chai-coms.
[01:57:32.449 --> 01:57:33.489]  Because that's their ideology.
[01:57:33.529 --> 01:57:41.831]  When the billionaires ran off to get married to the Qaikom Dragon, that's when the real system over here finally woke up and said, we've got to do something.
[01:57:42.291 --> 01:57:46.272]  And the final straw was undercutting the president's main base.
[01:57:46.332 --> 01:57:48.912]  So, you want to fight, boys, at Silicon Valley?
[01:57:49.272 --> 01:57:50.973]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:57:54.933 --> 01:57:57.034]  Joey, we have something here for our special visitors.
[01:57:57.054 --> 01:57:57.994]  Would you like to have it?
[01:57:58.621 --> 01:57:59.301]  Thank you.
[01:57:59.821 --> 01:58:00.462]  Thanks a lot.
[01:58:00.982 --> 01:58:01.382]  Sure.
[01:58:01.642 --> 01:58:02.882]  You ever been in a cockpit before?
[01:58:02.902 --> 01:58:03.703]  No, sir.
[01:58:03.803 --> 01:58:05.903]  I've never been up in a plane before.
[01:58:06.603 --> 01:58:08.544]  You ever seen a grown man naked?
[01:58:09.264 --> 01:58:10.525]  Paula, who said they like Coke?
[01:58:10.565 --> 01:58:10.865]  Me.
[01:58:11.205 --> 01:58:12.045]  Oh, you tell me about that.
[01:58:12.065 --> 01:58:12.825]  I like Coca-Cola.
[01:58:13.225 --> 01:58:14.026]  Oh, Coca-Cola.
[01:58:14.126 --> 01:58:16.326]  All right, but who knows about cocaine?
[01:58:16.486 --> 01:58:17.567]  Anyone ever seen cocaine?
[01:58:18.447 --> 01:58:20.688]  Yeah.
[01:58:20.768 --> 01:58:21.128]  Hold it.
[01:58:21.208 --> 01:58:21.688]  One at a time.
[01:58:21.728 --> 01:58:22.428]  What about cocaine?
[01:58:22.588 --> 01:58:23.008]  Good thing?
[01:58:23.048 --> 01:58:23.529]  Bad thing?
[01:58:23.569 --> 01:58:23.749]  What?
[01:58:23.909 --> 01:58:27.370]  Joey, you ever hang around the gymnasium?
[01:58:27.550 --> 01:58:28.270]  Two of you smokes?
[01:58:29.815 --> 01:58:31.116]  Come here, come on, raise your hand.
[01:58:31.376 --> 01:58:33.677]  Well, other than your parents, who smokes?
[01:58:33.697 --> 01:58:33.857]  Me.
[01:58:34.377 --> 01:58:35.217]  You got your smoke ready?
[01:58:35.257 --> 01:58:37.238]  I've seen a lot of kids with 12 and 11 smoking.
[01:58:37.418 --> 01:58:38.259]  I don't smoke.
[01:58:38.479 --> 01:58:38.819]  Alright.
[01:58:39.079 --> 01:58:41.720]  I don't smoke, but I'm a little kid.
[01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:43.401]  I'm only 5 years old.

[02:00:20.055 --> 02:00:23.977]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.261]  Look at social media.
[02:00:29.301 --> 02:00:32.724]  It's a thing called free speech rights.
[02:00:33.045 --> 02:00:38.830]  You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants.
[02:00:39.531 --> 02:00:50.661]  And I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results.
[02:00:50.761 --> 02:00:52.703]  And you know it can go the other way also.
[02:00:57.124 --> 02:01:09.634]  So that's what's happening is it's political meddling, it's election meddling, it's violating political speech, the most protected type.
[02:01:10.845 --> 02:01:15.069]  We have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes here with us getting into this.
[02:01:15.569 --> 02:01:33.204]  You told me about this days ago from your sources in D.C., I have similar sources, that the last straw for Trump wasn't just me getting banned, my name getting banned, it was Paul Watson particularly, and now they've lost $137 million in two days at Facebook and Google over this, and Trump is coming.
[02:01:33.224 --> 02:01:33.785]  This is a big deal.
[02:01:34.105 --> 02:01:34.785]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:01:35.086 --> 02:01:36.566]  They made a massive mistake.
[02:01:36.586 --> 02:01:54.535]  You're seeing Bloomberg talk about the possibility that all of these big social media tech giants might be taken apart, might be wiped off the map, might be basically forced to dissolve and forced to separate out its assets in the same way that Rockefeller was with Standard Oil back at the turn of the century.
[02:01:54.915 --> 02:02:02.442]  So I think what's happening is there's now the US Federal Trade Commission has now announced that Facebook has agreed to subject itself to an antitrust investigation.
[02:02:02.902 --> 02:02:06.806]  The Google antitrust investigation was leaked on Friday.
[02:02:07.427 --> 02:02:13.172]  There's talk that it will go further than Facebook and Google and they're looking at Twitter, they're looking at Netflix, they're looking at other operators.
[02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:16.395]  So these operators that decided to be so overtly political
[02:02:16.855 --> 02:02:34.968]  Over the last two years, that they were going to use their tech monopoly, their platform monopoly, to suppress, censor speech, to shame individuals, to leak private information against them, to use and leverage their power to help the Democrats take the House, to help the Democrat win the Senate in 2017, threatening to do so the same in 2020.
[02:02:35.628 --> 02:02:39.291]  When they reach the point where not only they ban people from using your name and InfoWars name,
[02:02:39.651 --> 02:02:49.736]  And at the same time, banned Paul Joseph Watson from all Facebook and Instagram overnight when they agreed he hadn't violated any rule ever.
[02:02:49.756 --> 02:02:53.098]  It was such a shock that it's what put the president in motion.
[02:02:53.118 --> 02:02:57.020]  He realized, okay, this is too severe, so severe, action needs to be taken.
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:03.003]  Let's unleash the kraken of antitrust enforcement against these rogue operators.
[02:03:03.203 --> 02:03:03.443]  We're good.
[02:03:18.445 --> 02:03:23.868]  It's a message that Wall Street got the message, the investors got the message, the political people got the message.
[02:03:24.208 --> 02:03:26.309]  These folks are going to pay a real consequence.
[02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:38.515]  And the point that Will Chamberlain and others were making is, imagine that one guy, Paul Joseph Watson in London, that was the final straw that broke the camel's back, cost just Facebook $40 billion today.
[02:03:40.396 --> 02:03:41.897]  Because the White House is a fan of Paul.
[02:03:41.917 --> 02:03:46.801]  I'm not going to get into the whole detail, but everybody knows Paul's just a funny, happy guy.
[02:03:46.821 --> 02:03:49.643]  The point is, it's not going to stop.
[02:03:51.024 --> 02:03:52.486]  They didn't just kick him off Facebook.
[02:03:52.506 --> 02:03:54.167]  They said he's dangerous, he's evil.
[02:03:54.547 --> 02:04:03.154]  And by the way, the White House knows since Obama was in, they have this whole Interpol system, which they're so freaked out they haven't announced it yet because it'll hurt the banking system because it's so discrediting.
[02:04:03.174 --> 02:04:05.296]  Imagine saying black people can't use credit cards.
[02:04:05.856 --> 02:04:07.957]  They have a plan where conservatives can't use credit cards.
[02:04:07.977 --> 02:04:25.648]  It was even in Reuters two weeks ago that the NRA won't be able to use cards, that they're hiring a Southern Poverty Law Center group to be a, quote, human rights commission at Visa and MasterCard to oversee what individuals are buying and doing to punish you if you support conservatives.
[02:04:26.068 --> 02:04:32.772]  I mean, so they want to abuse the big tech system, not in increments, but out of the gates, and that's really woken up people.
[02:04:33.052 --> 02:04:33.472]  Oh, no doubt.
[02:04:33.552 --> 02:04:37.773]  And what it does is, Watson just made it clear that their objective was purely political.
[02:04:38.013 --> 02:04:42.934]  Because here they admitted that they had no violation whatsoever of any rules, of any terms of service, ever.
[02:04:43.434 --> 02:04:43.614]  Ever.
[02:04:43.774 --> 02:04:44.354]  Of any kind.
[02:04:44.574 --> 02:04:49.916]  They couldn't even allege the kind of weak pretext and predicate claims they had against you or InfoWars.
[02:04:49.956 --> 02:04:51.456]  They had no basis whatsoever.
[02:04:51.716 --> 02:04:53.696]  And they admitted... It was just death penalty right away.
[02:04:53.916 --> 02:04:54.376]  Exactly.
[02:04:54.697 --> 02:04:57.337]  And that those emails had been leaked a couple of weeks before.
[02:04:57.617 --> 02:04:59.338]  So this was too much, too far.
[02:04:59.378 --> 02:05:00.318]  Let's finish up on that.
[02:05:00.338 --> 02:05:01.458]  We have another guest, but stay with us.
[02:05:06.141 --> 02:05:15.905]  This is next level, breaking ground, history book level, science fiction dystopia, Tyranny on Steroids.
[02:05:33.263 --> 02:05:34.204]  Bing, bing, bong, bong.
[02:05:34.244 --> 02:05:39.687]  Just take the red pill, people!
[02:05:41.308 --> 02:05:44.930]  InfoWars.
[02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:46.731]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:06:04.767 --> 02:06:06.228]  News out of Silicon Valley.
[02:06:06.288 --> 02:06:11.050]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[02:06:11.090 --> 02:06:14.692]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[02:06:14.772 --> 02:06:18.754]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[02:06:18.854 --> 02:06:21.876]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[02:06:21.996 --> 02:06:29.100]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:29.740]  Dangerous.
[02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:30.320]  Dangerous.
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:30.841]  Dangerous.
[02:06:30.881 --> 02:06:31.461]  Dangerous.
[02:06:32.041 --> 02:06:33.162]  Dangerous individuals.
[02:06:33.182 --> 02:06:34.303]  Dangerous individuals.
[02:06:34.363 --> 02:06:36.504]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[02:06:36.544 --> 02:06:39.686]  Basically they deem these individuals to be dangerous.
[02:06:39.726 --> 02:06:40.727]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[02:06:40.827 --> 02:06:41.247]  Danger.
[02:06:41.447 --> 02:06:42.468]  They call me dangerous.
[02:06:42.588 --> 02:06:44.009]  Danger is my middle name.
[02:06:44.209 --> 02:06:46.090]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[02:06:46.291 --> 02:06:49.533]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[02:06:49.653 --> 02:06:54.256]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[02:06:54.336 --> 02:06:55.797]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:06:55.997 --> 02:07:00.260]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:03.102]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[02:07:03.302 --> 02:07:05.143]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[02:07:05.323 --> 02:07:07.524]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[02:07:08.065 --> 02:07:10.386]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[02:07:10.506 --> 02:07:11.527]  I want them shut down.
[02:07:11.587 --> 02:07:12.508]  I want them silenced.
[02:07:12.548 --> 02:07:13.228]  I want them muted.
[02:07:13.248 --> 02:07:15.229]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:07:15.389 --> 02:07:16.670]  I want them shut down.
[02:07:17.090 --> 02:07:18.231]  I want them silenced.
[02:07:18.311 --> 02:07:19.092]  I want them muted.
[02:07:19.212 --> 02:07:22.394]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[02:07:24.266 --> 02:07:33.338]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[02:07:33.358 --> 02:07:42.070]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[02:07:42.110 --> 02:07:42.890]  Screw your rules.
[02:07:43.130 --> 02:07:46.392]  Your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[02:07:46.512 --> 02:07:49.052]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[02:07:49.573 --> 02:07:53.574]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[02:07:53.774 --> 02:07:56.175]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[02:07:56.315 --> 02:07:59.976]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[02:08:00.216 --> 02:08:07.279]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[02:08:07.419 --> 02:08:08.559]  You are a bad person.
[02:08:08.579 --> 02:08:09.920]  You should be censored off the internet.
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:10.701]  Bad, yes.
[02:08:11.021 --> 02:08:12.162]  Get out of here, Alex!
[02:08:12.422 --> 02:08:16.827]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[02:08:16.927 --> 02:08:25.856]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[02:08:26.036 --> 02:08:30.181]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:08:31.642 --> 02:08:33.164]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:08:46.528 --> 02:08:51.750]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes riding shotgun with us for a couple more segments.
[02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:59.792]  Then I'll open the phones up with our guests and he's gonna get back to work here with some big things we've got planned in concert with the President.
[02:08:59.812 --> 02:09:01.272]  We're up for big tech like we told you.
[02:09:01.292 --> 02:09:04.053]  I was getting ready with the antitrust actions a few months ago.
[02:09:04.073 --> 02:09:10.095]  I was in DC a month ago working on that with patriots in the federal government.
[02:09:11.843 --> 02:09:17.169]  Now on this next subject, and I wanted Bob to ride shotgun with us because he's got some views on this.
[02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:23.415]  I remember like two years ago, two and a half years ago, Dr. Jerome Corsi that used to do some work here with us.
[02:09:23.435 --> 02:09:24.997]  I've been interviewing him for like 18 years.
[02:09:27.321 --> 02:09:27.401]  It's
[02:09:43.991 --> 02:09:49.275]  You know, I'm talking to the President, and you're talking to folks in the White House, and I'm going and having meetings with U.S.
[02:09:49.315 --> 02:10:03.285]  intelligence, writing reports with law firms to the President, you know, and I'm actually watching it on the news the next day, and I'm being come after and everything, you know, and then I would then just see QAnon, which would just be random stuff on the Internet, say, Jones works for the Israelis!
[02:10:03.905 --> 02:10:05.086]  Well, he'll be in jail soon.
[02:10:05.126 --> 02:10:06.067]  Trump's out to get him.
[02:10:06.387 --> 02:10:08.508]  But I tell you that Jeff Sessions, he's a good guy.
[02:10:09.309 --> 02:10:11.991]  And so's that special counsel.
[02:10:14.551 --> 02:10:17.277]  We'll have Jones dealt with soon enough, that enemy of Trump.
[02:10:18.339 --> 02:10:21.966]  And I'll, you know, miss more phone calls from the President than I've been able to take.
[02:10:23.936 --> 02:10:25.617]  But then, you know, I heard this is a pretty good book.
[02:10:25.637 --> 02:10:26.598]  I haven't read the whole thing yet.
[02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:27.379]  I've scanned over it.
[02:10:28.159 --> 02:10:30.381]  And I just want to find out, what is QAnon?
[02:10:30.421 --> 02:10:36.006]  Has anyone ever met the magical, like, pixie or leprechaun or thing that does this?
[02:10:36.026 --> 02:10:37.827]  Because I've been on air 25 years.
[02:10:38.488 --> 02:10:41.110]  I've got Hillary Clinton suing me 20-something times to shut us down.
[02:10:41.590 --> 02:10:44.492]  You know, the globalists credit us and our audience for getting Trump elected.
[02:10:44.913 --> 02:10:47.315]  But then, if I could, you know, find this fount
[02:10:48.322 --> 02:10:49.804]  You know, the President tweets our stuff out.
[02:10:50.444 --> 02:11:09.005]  But if there's a Q even in the stuff that's texted out, then it's the total proof that this is the headwaters, this is the progenitor, this is the Moses on the mountain, this is everything, and it says, not this book, but whoever Q is, because Q could be anybody, you know, I just get the question.
[02:11:10.444 --> 02:11:12.745]  Years ago, a decade ago, are you for anonymous?
[02:11:12.825 --> 02:11:14.886]  And I said anonymous can be anybody you want.
[02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:22.571]  I'm for people having free speech and I'm for people being anonymous, but anonymous is anybody who wants to put on a Guy Fawkes mask and put a video on the internet.
[02:11:22.791 --> 02:11:23.091]  Oh yeah.
[02:11:23.151 --> 02:11:26.613]  So my thing is, hey, I'm not enemies with this Q thing.
[02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:46.121]  Of course he got deep into it, and then said, oh, it's terrible it's saying we're bad, because it's all this infighting over the magical holy grail of, I mean, it doesn't matter if you talk to the president, it doesn't matter if you go confront Sadiq, you know, and the head of the Google, Sundar in Congress, none of what you've ever done matters.
[02:11:47.113 --> 02:11:58.703]  Because if you don't have the blessing of that magic, sky opens, angels descend, and the Q forms, you don't have that, it doesn't matter if you're 10th generation Texan.
[02:11:59.183 --> 02:12:04.347]  It doesn't matter if you have family in 1776, because this is more important than Trump.
[02:12:04.407 --> 02:12:05.308]  This is God.
[02:12:06.269 --> 02:12:07.350]  This is King Jesus.
[02:12:08.024 --> 02:12:11.686]  No one's ever seen it, no one knows what it is, but it's got to be bowed down to.
[02:12:11.746 --> 02:12:13.247]  So, here's the thing.
[02:12:13.927 --> 02:12:15.228]  I'm ready to bow down to it.
[02:12:15.468 --> 02:12:15.929]  I'm ready.
[02:12:16.849 --> 02:12:18.890]  All I'm saying is, I have no credibility.
[02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:21.392]  I just talked to the President.
[02:12:22.426 --> 02:12:23.567]  I just write reports for the President.
[02:12:23.967 --> 02:12:25.288]  The President just tweets my stuff out.
[02:12:26.389 --> 02:12:27.430]  This has the credibility.
[02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:31.012]  So joining us is Roy Davis, who is a nice guy from the Q movement.
[02:12:32.333 --> 02:12:35.696]  And so he, Captain Roy, is a proud father of two boys and grandfather.
[02:12:36.116 --> 02:12:39.779]  He's retired from the travel industry and lives on his boat in Florida.
[02:12:39.799 --> 02:12:40.439]  He's a U.S.
[02:12:40.459 --> 02:12:43.382]  Merchant Marine Officer holding Masters Captain rating with the U.S.
[02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:45.363]  Coast Guard and DHS Homeland Security.
[02:12:45.883 --> 02:12:48.986]  He's a Reddit original poster and Q scribe.
[02:12:50.558 --> 02:12:51.718]  Again, I'm not putting it down.
[02:12:51.758 --> 02:12:52.078]  I don't know.
[02:12:52.098 --> 02:12:53.479]  I'm going to learn the magic.
[02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:54.859]  Author and patriot.
[02:12:55.619 --> 02:13:00.280]  Roy's the best-selling co-author of QAnon, An Invitation to the Great Awakening.
[02:13:01.521 --> 02:13:06.082]  The book was the second best-selling book on Amazon, the first on censorship and politics category.
[02:13:06.582 --> 02:13:12.783]  His new book is directed to Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, and a good percentage of every book sold will go right towards that.
[02:13:13.043 --> 02:13:15.184]  So thanks for joining us, Captain Roy Davis.
[02:13:16.844 --> 02:13:17.464]  And I'm being serious.
[02:13:17.484 --> 02:13:18.465]  We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[02:13:18.485 --> 02:13:19.165]  You've got the floor.
[02:13:21.184 --> 02:13:23.308]  Did I not properly worship Q?
[02:13:23.488 --> 02:13:28.376]  Because I'm not an Israeli agent and I do talk to the President and our audience did help get him elected.
[02:13:28.436 --> 02:13:31.561]  How do I become worthy to even suck the toes of Q?
[02:13:33.084 --> 02:13:34.725]  Alex, it's not that official, really.
[02:13:34.805 --> 02:13:38.328]  And again, we're not looking to be confrontational.
[02:13:38.548 --> 02:13:46.715]  You mentioned earlier in this program, and I was glad I was listening, because you said that a lot of times the folks are looking for the truth, the secret sauce.
[02:13:47.035 --> 02:13:59.345]  And what we're here to say is that myself and thousands of anons feel like we finally found the real McCoy, somebody that was going to be able to drop truth informational
[02:14:01.303 --> 02:14:04.684]  We call them drops, but it gives us a chance to look behind the curtain.
[02:14:05.265 --> 02:14:10.327]  And really, the genesis of this book, it really was with with 12 associates of mine.
[02:14:10.367 --> 02:14:11.447]  We all took a chapter.
[02:14:11.467 --> 02:14:12.367]  It came out.
[02:14:12.627 --> 02:14:13.508]  You'll appreciate this.
[02:14:13.548 --> 02:14:16.009]  It came out of censorship and being banned.
[02:14:16.049 --> 02:14:17.309]  We just had a little group.
[02:14:17.329 --> 02:14:19.050]  We're not trying to convert anybody.
[02:14:19.090 --> 02:14:21.351]  We're just trying to let people know what we found.
[02:14:21.671 --> 02:14:22.991]  And you can choose to believe it or not.
[02:14:23.031 --> 02:14:24.452]  We're just reporting what we found.
[02:14:24.492 --> 02:14:27.033]  And we feel like we found the real McCoy in the Chan boards.
[02:14:27.433 --> 02:14:33.776]  Some true insider that's giving us the skinny about what's happening and not the the mockingbird media lies.
[02:14:33.796 --> 02:14:38.639]  I want to be clear because I'll have you on for 10 hours over the next month to get to the bottom of this.
[02:14:39.359 --> 02:14:40.700]  I early on because I respect Corsi.
[02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:41.750]  Yes.
[02:15:00.103 --> 02:15:21.783]  Well, no, it really wasn't, you know, it wasn't really hijacked, and I was explaining this to Darian, I said this to some other people, is that the network, and no one has talked to Q, and there's no communications outside of the board, is a group of people that are military intelligence background, and they've been asked to give this information out.
[02:15:21.843 --> 02:15:23.645]  It's not classified information, it's just
[02:15:24.005 --> 02:15:28.168]  Well, you seem like a genuine, nice, smart guy, and people who told me they read your book say it's great.
[02:15:28.188 --> 02:15:29.009]  I'm going to read it.
[02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:30.510]  I've just been so busy.
[02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:33.232]  In fact, I'll read it this weekend and have you back on.
[02:15:33.252 --> 02:15:40.037]  Then I'm going to give you the floor when we come back, because I did my whole diatribe, venting about people saying their cue, which obviously weren't speaking for it, whatever.
[02:15:53.246 --> 02:15:54.328]  I'm not enemies with this thing.
[02:15:54.969 --> 02:16:00.858]  I just sit there and I watch stuff going, Trump is Jones's enemy, says Q, and obviously that's not Q, it's Bunch Bull.
[02:16:18.567 --> 02:16:22.730]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:16:23.550 --> 02:16:33.837]  I was just at a local t-shirt shop six months ago, and I bought a t-shirt that showed the space shuttle blasting off into space.
[02:16:34.998 --> 02:16:39.181]  And I happened to wear that on Joe Rogan's podcast, and people just talked about the shirt everywhere.
[02:16:39.761 --> 02:16:41.963]  All these websites got started selling the shirt.
[02:16:43.291 --> 02:16:45.093]  Because it's a NASA patch.
[02:16:45.413 --> 02:16:47.134]  So it's copyright free, it's government.
[02:16:47.435 --> 02:16:51.198]  But I had it redone where it says Space Force.
[02:16:52.359 --> 02:16:55.642]  And we made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[02:16:55.782 --> 02:16:57.984]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[02:16:58.425 --> 02:17:03.009]  And it's got a red, white, blue American flag on the right shoulder with Infowars.com.
[02:17:03.089 --> 02:17:06.652]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify.
[02:17:07.032 --> 02:17:08.714]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[02:17:08.754 --> 02:17:13.158]  Now, the 18-wheeler, printed, produced, made in America, arrives next Wednesday.
[02:17:13.278 --> 02:17:15.080]  But I want to do some fanfare on this shirt.
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:17.422]  I believe this is going to be the next Hillary for Prison shirt.
[02:17:18.323 --> 02:17:19.844]  But it's about a pro-human future.
[02:17:20.605 --> 02:17:22.367]  It's about humanity going to the stars.
[02:17:22.987 --> 02:17:24.448]  It's about believing in
[02:17:25.689 --> 02:17:27.690]  The amazing gifts that God's given us.
[02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:28.410]  We're not gods.
[02:17:28.430 --> 02:17:30.430]  We're not going to be gods, but we're made in the image of God.
[02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:31.911]  So we're a reflection.
[02:17:32.331 --> 02:17:33.651]  So we can do some amazing things.
[02:17:33.711 --> 02:17:34.892]  We're master builders.
[02:17:35.112 --> 02:17:40.233]  And the space shuttle's 1930s technology put into function in the late 1970s, retired five years ago.
[02:17:40.413 --> 02:17:41.453]  And so we've redone it.
[02:17:41.614 --> 02:17:47.475]  Also had people on the street love the shirt, but a few have gone, why are you wearing that gay rainbow flag?
[02:17:47.655 --> 02:17:49.596]  And that's when I decided a few months ago to make the shirt.
[02:17:49.716 --> 02:17:53.217]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sick of leftist groups or whoever expropriating
[02:17:54.278 --> 02:17:55.519]  Appropriating symbols.
[02:17:55.759 --> 02:17:59.563]  If you're a homosexual and you're not doing illegal stuff, I don't care what you do in your bedroom.
[02:17:59.583 --> 02:18:01.906]  That's the left claiming the conservatives are obsessed with what you're doing.
[02:18:01.926 --> 02:18:03.988]  Just leave kids alone with your heterosexual, homosexual.
[02:18:04.188 --> 02:18:06.270]  Plus, it's not a plastic rainbow.
[02:18:06.291 --> 02:18:07.892]  It's supposed to be the atmosphere.
[02:18:08.493 --> 02:18:15.761]  Anybody that knows, that's why NASA created this, low in the atmosphere is more dust and stuff than a spectrometer or in a telescope, it's red.
[02:18:17.597 --> 02:18:18.858]  As you get higher, it's orange.
[02:18:18.918 --> 02:18:25.461]  That's why the sun on the horizon is red, because you're looking through hundreds of miles of atmosphere to a few miles of atmosphere.
[02:18:25.481 --> 02:18:27.522]  So clear sky is black.
[02:18:28.422 --> 02:18:31.444]  Below that is blue, then it's yellow, then it's orange, then it's red.
[02:18:31.504 --> 02:18:33.365]  That's why out of thousands of
[02:18:34.105 --> 02:18:35.046]  Space shuttle patches.
[02:18:35.066 --> 02:18:35.767]  They've got thousands.
[02:18:35.787 --> 02:18:37.569]  It took me days to actually find the original patch.
[02:18:37.749 --> 02:18:39.311]  So this is a copy of the original patch.
[02:18:39.732 --> 02:18:42.835]  We put Space Force on it and established 2020.
[02:18:42.935 --> 02:18:45.178]  American flag on the side.
[02:18:45.418 --> 02:18:46.339]  I designed this shirt.
[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:47.961]  I'm very proud of this shirt.
[02:18:48.522 --> 02:18:52.647]  And maybe I'm wrong, but when I think this is zeitgeist, it tends to be a zeitgeist.
[02:18:54.181 --> 02:18:56.842]  I've had other shirts, hundreds of thousands of which have been put on the street.
[02:18:57.423 --> 02:18:59.184]  And it's helped fund our operation as well.
[02:18:59.224 --> 02:19:06.667]  But this shirt has such nice fabric, made in America, all of it, that it cost us $10 a shirt.
[02:19:07.528 --> 02:19:09.329]  I did a huge order and got it down for $13.
[02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:12.780]  The printing and the quality of the shirt.
[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:14.901]  And we're coming up with a women's version as well.
[02:19:14.941 --> 02:19:15.801]  Women can wear this as well.
[02:19:16.681 --> 02:19:17.642]  I'm very proud of it.
[02:19:17.702 --> 02:19:18.882]  People are going to be like, what is that?
[02:19:19.602 --> 02:19:21.042]  What is Space Force?
[02:19:21.082 --> 02:19:22.783]  So it's kind of an undercover thing too.
[02:19:22.803 --> 02:19:27.424]  It's like, you might get hit in the head with a bike lock or stabbed if you're a Trump supporter and you're out there doing something.
[02:19:27.504 --> 02:19:29.144]  And you're wearing a Trump shirt or InfoWars shirt.
[02:19:29.264 --> 02:19:30.304]  People still love those and wear them.
[02:19:30.465 --> 02:19:31.345]  What about a Space Force?
[02:19:31.505 --> 02:19:36.186]  What about loving technology and what we built and having a pro-human future in space?
[02:19:36.246 --> 02:19:38.046]  The American flag that triggers so many.
[02:19:38.106 --> 02:19:39.407]  LittleInfoWars.com.
[02:19:39.807 --> 02:19:40.847]  I think this is the shirt, so.
[02:19:41.347 --> 02:19:42.909]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:30.857 --> 02:20:36.459]  All right, Alex Jones here, broadcasting live.
[02:20:37.459 --> 02:20:43.521]  Worldwide, in defiance of the globalist attempt to shut us down, thanks to the audience, spreading the word, you're beyond the resistance.
[02:20:43.541 --> 02:20:49.823]  You're the heart and blood and guts and bone and fists and brains and eyeballs of this whole damn operation.
[02:20:50.544 --> 02:20:52.304]  So, I'm going to read this book this weekend.
[02:20:52.324 --> 02:20:53.325]  I got it a few weeks ago.
[02:20:54.931 --> 02:21:03.057]  I read the QAnon stuff and it's a bunch of as we all as one goes we all go and you know look for the magic stuff figure out what it means.
[02:21:03.737 --> 02:21:10.081]  If it gets people thinking about politics and about behind the scenes and about not just one-dimensional it's healthy.
[02:21:11.122 --> 02:21:12.003]  My issue is
[02:21:13.342 --> 02:21:23.231]  People saying they were QAnon, saying Jeff Sessions is good, Alex Jones is bad, Trump's got it all under control, when I know for a fact he's fighting for his life.
[02:21:23.551 --> 02:21:24.592]  We're starting to turn the corner.
[02:21:25.853 --> 02:21:35.401]  That's where I got frustrated, and I know Bob Barnes, constitutional lawyer, has some points on this, and why he thinks the QAnon thing is so important.
[02:21:36.482 --> 02:21:37.903]  I just know, I go out to like,
[02:21:38.669 --> 02:21:39.110]  We're good to go.
[02:21:58.510 --> 02:22:03.794]  I just have had the President on and on record talk to him and get him reports and, you know, do all this.
[02:22:04.214 --> 02:22:06.075]  But how do I become a holy one?
[02:22:06.275 --> 02:22:06.876]  But I understand.
[02:22:07.676 --> 02:22:12.259]  Your book, An Invitation to the Great Awakening, The Renaissance, that's something I promote.
[02:22:12.639 --> 02:22:18.223]  We appreciate Roy Davis, kathrynroydavis at gmail.com, bestselling book on Amazon.
[02:22:20.024 --> 02:22:22.927]  I mean, who can speak for QAnon?
[02:22:22.947 --> 02:22:25.229]  Has anyone met this person?
[02:22:26.450 --> 02:22:27.892]  What do you want to say about it?
[02:22:28.552 --> 02:22:32.756]  No, Alex, nobody's ever met Q, and probably nobody will.
[02:22:32.796 --> 02:22:41.104]  It's a team of people, and no one's even spoke to Q. All the communications are just through the Chan boards, originally 4chan, now it's 8chan, and that's the way it's set up.
[02:22:42.305 --> 02:22:42.506]  I think?
[02:23:01.144 --> 02:23:01.284]  Yeah.
[02:23:18.153 --> 02:23:20.814]  It's not all spelled out, and certainly we know President Trump.
[02:23:20.834 --> 02:23:25.355]  I mean, one of the first things he's told everybody is he's never going to dictate his plans.
[02:23:25.395 --> 02:23:27.575]  He's never going to forecast what he's going to do.
[02:23:28.176 --> 02:23:31.556]  And again, part of that is the art of deception, the art of the deal, what have you.
[02:23:31.616 --> 02:23:33.637]  And again, that's the way the board works.
[02:23:33.677 --> 02:23:35.277]  There's no one person that speaks for it.
[02:23:35.617 --> 02:23:44.179]  This is information that flows freely, publicly, and we're just some people that have dedicated some time into figuring out what's going on and just conveying that to the public.
[02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:45.880]  Okay, well, let's say Q's real.
[02:23:47.435 --> 02:23:49.876]  That's just one person in government with all these other deals.
[02:23:50.357 --> 02:23:55.879]  I have a former CIA section chief, Sean, with breaking down plans to overthrow the president.
[02:23:55.939 --> 02:24:06.125]  I have former, you know, full-bird colonels that ran huge black op-ops saying Hillary was shipping missiles into Syria and they killed the ambassador, and two years later it all comes out as true.
[02:24:06.485 --> 02:24:12.148]  No one cares when I've got, like, former section chief or former commander that's like,
[02:24:12.828 --> 02:24:20.293]  Whatever, we have Q, and it says you're a traitor, and I'm just sitting here looking at this.
[02:24:20.313 --> 02:24:22.415]  I can't follow it all the time.
[02:24:23.335 --> 02:24:28.599]  When Q, how do you know when it's on 4chan or 8chan that it is the Q person?
[02:24:28.619 --> 02:24:33.062]  Because I've seen some smart things said by who they said was Q, but how do you even know all this?
[02:24:33.963 --> 02:24:44.777]  And then have you seen the Lord and Savior, the Highness Supreme, King of Kings, the actual Q, say that I'm this horrible person who's about to be arrested for treason against Trump?
[02:24:44.797 --> 02:24:48.662]  Because I get these calls that the Lord Q has said that I'm bad.
[02:24:49.622 --> 02:24:52.103]  Well, there's a lot of misinformation out there, Alex.
[02:24:52.143 --> 02:24:55.924]  I mean, for one, I can tell you, and I've seen every post, there's never anything mentioned about Bill Hicks.
[02:24:55.944 --> 02:25:00.766]  So, you know, if somebody told you that that was in there, they've been giving you false information, trying to pin it on us.
[02:25:01.006 --> 02:25:13.051]  I just see these YouTube videos with a half a million views of guys going, I used to like Alex Jones until I learned he was a traitor from Q. And so I'm just, I'm trying, okay, so those are Q pretenders to the Q throne.
[02:25:13.874 --> 02:25:15.795]  Well, it's not even a throne, Alex.
[02:25:15.815 --> 02:25:20.157]  This is just a movement of millions of people, and there's no real leader.
[02:25:20.237 --> 02:25:21.577]  And I think it's built that way.
[02:25:21.617 --> 02:25:25.479]  And I think a lot of people are trying to grasp how we can bottle this, how we can get this all.
[02:25:25.779 --> 02:25:26.739]  Who's the spokesperson?
[02:25:26.799 --> 02:25:29.641]  All I'm saying is, brother, I've read some of your book.
[02:25:29.661 --> 02:25:30.181]  It looks good.
[02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:31.141]  You seem like a nice guy.
[02:25:31.882 --> 02:25:33.042]  I've had the president on.
[02:25:33.142 --> 02:25:35.143]  I've had a whole bunch of conversations with the president.
[02:25:35.423 --> 02:25:37.004]  But our listeners got him elected.
[02:25:37.044 --> 02:25:38.484]  So this is tail wagging the dog.
[02:25:39.065 --> 02:25:40.685]  We're real people.
[02:25:40.845 --> 02:25:41.065]  Hold on.
[02:25:41.145 --> 02:25:42.166]  I'm an American patriot.
[02:25:42.646 --> 02:25:44.408]  All I'm saying is, is that I'm here.
[02:25:45.028 --> 02:25:45.829]  I'm a real person.
[02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:47.150]  My name is Alexander Jones.
[02:25:47.811 --> 02:25:48.872]  I've been here 25 years.
[02:25:49.032 --> 02:25:49.592]  I'm real.
[02:25:50.193 --> 02:25:56.799]  And so when I just hear people saying that this holiness has said that I'm bad, I want to just find out what, who the holiness is.
[02:25:57.890 --> 02:26:08.713]  Well, Alex, there's been a year and a half, and I think what happened a while back, if we're talking about late April or May, I mean, I knew Jerry Corsi before Q. I come from the JFK movement.
[02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:17.096]  I think Jerry Corsi said some things that were toxic to our point of view.
[02:26:18.036 --> 02:26:19.857]  And again, as you know, I mean, he did a 180.
[02:26:20.237 --> 02:26:23.998]  So again, I'm not trying to talk out of school or talk bad about anybody else.
[02:26:24.038 --> 02:26:25.158]  He just changed his mind.
[02:26:25.238 --> 02:26:25.838]  No, I hear you.
[02:26:25.918 --> 02:26:27.079]  And Corsi's suing me.
[02:26:27.819 --> 02:26:29.401]  And I'm not going to get into it for no reason.
[02:26:29.501 --> 02:26:30.342]  So I agree.
[02:26:30.362 --> 02:26:33.806]  I just suspected him and said, OK, Q must be back as he said.
[02:26:33.826 --> 02:26:37.650]  And maybe when I attack Q, then other people in Q's name attack me.
[02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:38.892]  I mean, if I'm wrong, I'll say it.
[02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:40.938]  Well, it's not even a question of being right.
[02:26:40.958 --> 02:26:42.779]  We're just trying to all move forward.
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:48.404]  Everybody that is Q is 100% behind President Trump.
[02:26:48.504 --> 02:26:50.886]  I mean, so everybody here is on the same team.
[02:26:51.206 --> 02:26:52.026]  Well, that's good news.
[02:26:52.066 --> 02:26:53.127]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:26:53.167 --> 02:26:55.209]  You'll have the floor to break that down, because I want to move forward.
[02:26:55.229 --> 02:26:57.751]  Because I think I'm known for 25 years.
[02:26:57.851 --> 02:26:59.532]  I've talked to the President.
[02:26:59.552 --> 02:27:00.613]  I'm a patriot, you know.
[02:27:00.953 --> 02:27:06.137]  And I just want people to know out there that I think the left may have hijacked Q. You're a constitutional lawyer.
[02:27:06.157 --> 02:27:07.118]  What's your take on this, briefly?
[02:27:07.537 --> 02:27:14.899]  Well, I mean, I think some of the interesting things that maybe he can answer is I've been a Q skeptic from day one and there's a wide range of reasons for that.
[02:27:15.299 --> 02:27:19.440]  I respect the people who want to do their own independent inquiry and want to come to their own conclusions.
[02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:25.721]  I'm skeptical of anything that was suggesting that either Trump had more control than they did.
[02:27:25.741 --> 02:27:29.962]  They didn't recognize the degree of threat that the president faced.
[02:27:30.002 --> 02:27:36.364]  We do have a real dual state in the country that the president does not control and that is a constant continuous threat to the president.
[02:27:37.085 --> 02:27:47.335]  I was particularly critical when aspects of the Q crowd was suggesting that either Sessions or Huber were in control, when my view was they were not, based on my experience in the criminal defense field.
[02:27:48.156 --> 02:27:56.825]  And now, of course, it turned out Barr wouldn't need to be there and wouldn't need to be stepping in and hiring other people if Huber had been doing anything over the last two years of consequence.
[02:27:57.325 --> 02:28:01.528]  Um, but I respect the sincerity of the people that are involved in the Q concerns.
[02:28:01.868 --> 02:28:11.874]  My concern was that some of that was being misled and misdirected to believe things were safer than they really were, to believe that Julian Assange was in a better position than he really was.
[02:28:12.254 --> 02:28:15.376]  There was part of the Q movement that thought that Julian Assange was safe.
[02:28:15.416 --> 02:28:17.177]  Oh yeah, Grudge even picked up our story.
[02:28:17.737 --> 02:28:21.459]  From Corsi that he was going to be flown out to Switzerland.
[02:28:21.499 --> 02:28:22.659]  And I tried to call Corsi.
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.220]  Corsi says Q says.
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:27.342]  And I said, man, stop going with what Q says.
[02:28:27.842 --> 02:28:28.302]  Correct.
[02:28:28.322 --> 02:28:30.043]  I don't want to feed Drudge BS.
[02:28:30.343 --> 02:28:31.664]  I've never done that in my life.
[02:28:32.024 --> 02:28:32.464]  Precisely.
[02:28:32.524 --> 02:28:40.168]  And the other important part is, I think, you know, in dealing with people in the tax protest movement, other movements have dealt with people that... The point is, stay there when you come back.
[02:28:40.328 --> 02:28:41.789]  I had so much credibility then.
[02:28:41.809 --> 02:28:44.330]  Because I'd never screwed Drudge over.
[02:28:46.139 --> 02:28:48.702]  That I think Drudge probably halfway looks at me a little askance now.
[02:28:49.283 --> 02:28:49.983]  Rightfully so.
[02:28:50.344 --> 02:28:51.345]  Because he linked a course.
[02:28:51.365 --> 02:28:54.108]  He's saying that Assange is being flown next week to Switzerland.
[02:28:54.368 --> 02:28:55.549]  It wasn't true!
[02:28:55.849 --> 02:28:56.971]  It wasn't real!
[02:28:57.231 --> 02:28:58.913]  And it burned my ass!
[02:29:04.207 --> 02:29:06.929]  Sometimes grown-ups touch kids in ways they don't like.
[02:29:07.489 --> 02:29:10.030]  I was wrestling with my uncle, and it changed.
[02:29:10.351 --> 02:29:11.211]  It felt icky.
[02:29:11.451 --> 02:29:14.673]  When touching feels funny, it's hard to know what to do.
[02:29:14.693 --> 02:29:17.054]  He said I shouldn't tell anyone.
[02:29:17.075 --> 02:29:19.976]  If that ever happens to you, say no.
[02:29:20.456 --> 02:29:20.697]  No!
[02:29:20.977 --> 02:29:21.617]  Then go!
[02:29:21.937 --> 02:29:22.257]  No!
[02:29:22.758 --> 02:29:24.099]  And tell someone you trust.
[02:29:24.639 --> 02:29:24.979]  Tell!
[02:29:25.259 --> 02:29:26.060]  Say no!
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:27.741]  Then go!
[02:29:28.221 --> 02:29:29.021]  And tell!
[02:29:29.202 --> 02:29:31.943]  A message from the American Medical Association.
[02:29:31.963 --> 02:29:33.364]  I'll bet you're as bright as you're good-looking.
[02:29:34.511 --> 02:29:35.651]  What's your favorite subject?
[02:29:37.492 --> 02:29:38.092]  Journalism.
[02:29:38.212 --> 02:29:38.713]  Journalism?
[02:29:39.073 --> 02:29:39.393]  Whoa!
[02:29:40.413 --> 02:29:43.454]  Whoa, I better be more circumspect in my answers.
[02:29:43.494 --> 02:29:45.935]  Those guys back there.
[02:29:48.896 --> 02:29:51.357]  Go ahead, the next question.
[02:29:52.318 --> 02:29:54.158]  And by the way, that's one of the things that's a dangerous idea.
[02:29:54.438 --> 02:29:56.779]  You know, as these guys will tell you, I'm not always their favorite subject.
[02:29:57.019 --> 02:30:00.361]  But the truth of the matter is, the reason we are who we are is called a free press.
[02:30:00.401 --> 02:30:01.421]  Continue to stand against it.
[02:30:04.102 --> 02:30:05.804]  Hello, Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[02:30:05.824 --> 02:30:07.725]  If I were the devil.
[02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:12.269]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:19.255]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[02:30:22.316 --> 02:30:25.377]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[02:30:25.437 --> 02:30:29.138]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[02:30:29.258 --> 02:30:30.639]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[02:30:30.719 --> 02:30:32.419]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[02:30:32.839 --> 02:30:36.280]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:37.201]  Do as you please.
[02:30:37.701 --> 02:30:39.801]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[02:30:40.242 --> 02:30:43.743]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[02:30:44.123 --> 02:30:47.664]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[02:30:48.204 --> 02:30:50.405]  And the old I would teach to pray after me.
[02:30:51.326 --> 02:30:53.687]  Our father, witch art in Washington.
[02:30:54.548 --> 02:30:55.709]  And then I'd get organized.
[02:30:55.809 --> 02:31:01.772]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[02:31:01.852 --> 02:31:04.974]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[02:31:05.255 --> 02:31:06.956]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[02:31:07.016 --> 02:31:10.037]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[02:31:10.318 --> 02:31:12.179]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[02:31:13.817 --> 02:31:23.944]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[02:31:24.024 --> 02:31:29.707]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flames.
[02:31:30.168 --> 02:31:32.489]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:31:32.649 --> 02:31:38.153]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the discipline of motion.
[02:31:38.513 --> 02:31:39.935]  Just let those run wild.
[02:31:40.035 --> 02:31:42.757]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing.
[02:31:42.997 --> 02:31:45.120]  I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:50.705]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[02:31:51.125 --> 02:31:54.208]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[02:31:56.215 --> 02:32:01.041]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[02:32:01.481 --> 02:32:08.770]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[02:32:10.471 --> 02:32:12.172]  I would caution against extremes.
[02:32:12.313 --> 02:32:13.253]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:32:13.273 --> 02:32:14.594]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:32:14.854 --> 02:32:15.735]  This isn't a game!
[02:32:15.955 --> 02:32:26.842]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[02:32:26.862 --> 02:32:35.909]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[02:32:35.989 --> 02:32:39.111]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[02:32:58.433 --> 02:33:02.041]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:08.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.286 --> 02:33:41.575]  So, if you've got a few questions, real quick questions for our guest on QAnon.
[02:33:42.416 --> 02:33:44.557]  He's one of the leading, most respected experts on it.
[02:33:44.577 --> 02:33:47.738]  I think it's a fascinating phenomenon you can talk about for days.
[02:33:47.778 --> 02:33:48.819]  So I appreciate him coming on.
[02:33:48.839 --> 02:33:49.539]  He's a nice fellow.
[02:33:50.139 --> 02:33:50.560]  That's great.
[02:33:52.544 --> 02:33:54.765]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:33:54.785 --> 02:33:55.985]  877-789-2539.
[02:33:56.005 --> 02:33:56.665]  877-789-2539.
[02:33:57.025 --> 02:34:07.748]  So, your book, The Great Awakening, here, Captain Roy Davis, or Captain Roy D, as you're known online.
[02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:15.491]  Other points you want to make about QAnon and all of this, because it became this huge phenomenon.
[02:34:15.551 --> 02:34:19.732]  I remember being three years ago at the RNC, about a third of the shirts were mfulwars.com.
[02:34:21.525 --> 02:34:23.066]  And Hillary for President shirts are shirts.
[02:34:23.506 --> 02:34:27.789]  And, you know, I go to the Trump rallies, about 10%, 15% are now, and the other 15% are QAnon.
[02:34:29.350 --> 02:34:35.714]  And a lot of folks still shake my hand and like me, but others look at me and they say, you know, too bad you're going to prison, Q said.
[02:34:35.854 --> 02:34:37.796]  So you're saying people might have told me wrong.
[02:34:38.416 --> 02:34:46.421]  Whatever it is on the internet thinks the guy that the mainstream media thinks got Trump elected is the enemy and I've got to be shut down.
[02:34:46.881 --> 02:34:48.983]  So that's why I'm just interested in it.
[02:34:50.259 --> 02:34:59.304]  Why would Trump put all those tweets out supporting Infowars and saying we're good and saying we don't doctor video and tweeting and saying he's so proud and so happy to see our work?
[02:35:00.404 --> 02:35:02.445]  Is that like some super slick Q thing?
[02:35:02.845 --> 02:35:04.386]  A code to let folks know I'm the bad guy?
[02:35:05.206 --> 02:35:07.187]  No, I think we're all on the same side, Alex.
[02:35:07.267 --> 02:35:11.930]  I think it just got eschewed a while back with the Corsi controversy, if you ask me.
[02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:15.792]  No, no, you're on the page with me, boy, let me tell you.
[02:35:15.852 --> 02:35:18.133]  Instead of me interrupting, give us your Q view then.
[02:35:19.133 --> 02:35:21.635]  Well, you were talking about where to start in the book here.
[02:35:21.655 --> 02:35:25.197]  I'll tell you, because all my articles are about political corruption.
[02:35:25.257 --> 02:35:26.878]  It'd be right in your wheelhouse.
[02:35:26.918 --> 02:35:32.222]  My chapter there in that book was called The Characters of Obamagate, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:35:32.242 --> 02:35:33.663]  A little bit of a Clint Eastwood theme.
[02:35:33.703 --> 02:35:39.727]  And what I did is I have about 200 articles that deep dives on all these characters.
[02:35:39.787 --> 02:35:42.789]  And I picked out five good guys, like Admiral Rogers, Mike Flynn.
[02:35:43.129 --> 02:35:44.870]  I picked out five medium people.
[02:35:44.930 --> 02:35:48.873]  And then I picked out five of the real bad guys, like Soros and Hillary Clintons and such.
[02:35:49.554 --> 02:35:53.419]  I did read that part of your book, and I agree with what Q has said, who the good guys are.
[02:35:53.499 --> 02:35:56.403]  Admiral Rogers helped blow the whistle when he was president-elect.
[02:35:56.423 --> 02:35:57.064]  He did a great job.
[02:35:59.586 --> 02:36:08.574]  I mean, I think the biggest concern people had was that you had, within the Q movement, a lot of very intelligent people, a lot of very sincere people, a lot of very dedicated people.
[02:36:08.614 --> 02:36:20.164]  And the fear was, or the worry was, that they would, that their great skills and collective talent and collective voices would be detoured on agendas that were not consistent with protecting the president.
[02:36:20.184 --> 02:36:20.765]  Rattled.
[02:36:20.845 --> 02:36:21.185]  Exactly.
[02:36:21.725 --> 02:36:38.881]  It basically eliminated from the public debate and dialogue about issues about Julian Assange, issues about Deep State, issues because there was part of the Q movement that was giving this impression of safety and security that said, don't worry, all of it's planned out, you don't have to worry about whether Sessions is doing his job.
[02:36:39.181 --> 02:36:41.483]  You don't have to worry about whether Huber is doing anything at all.
[02:36:41.823 --> 02:36:50.911]  You don't have to worry about whether the president is under constant, continuous threat of de facto blackmail and extortion to engage in unnecessary wars and military conflicts.
[02:36:51.231 --> 02:36:57.296]  You don't have to worry about whether Julian Assange will spend the rest of his life in the bottom of a prison cell somewhere at Supermax.
[02:36:57.636 --> 02:36:59.498]  When Trump said, if you got it, release it,
[02:36:59.898 --> 02:37:00.298]  Absolutely.
[02:37:00.338 --> 02:37:04.041]  Not only that, what Julian Assange did was expose the corruption of Hillary Clinton.
[02:37:04.081 --> 02:37:06.462]  Let's be clear, that's the only reason why he ever got prosecuted.
[02:37:06.522 --> 02:37:10.145]  Oh, same reason we're under attack is because we stood against the little dear Madam President.
[02:37:10.385 --> 02:37:18.930]  And I started seeing so-called QAnon people saying, oh don't worry, Jones will be arrested soon, Trump knows, when they actually had a Justice Department deal open trying to arrest me.
[02:37:19.411 --> 02:37:24.274]  So then I was seeing concerted effort using QAnon's name in stuff no one would know.
[02:37:24.294 --> 02:37:27.496]  So I'm like, oh he does have intel, but he's working for the Democrats.
[02:37:28.196 --> 02:37:36.461]  Well, what happened in my interaction was people that were part of the Q community were emailing me asking me about whether or not there are military tribunals in Guantanamo.
[02:37:36.741 --> 02:37:38.602]  How would that work legally and jurisdictionally?
[02:37:38.902 --> 02:37:40.683]  And I pointed out, I said, that's just not happening.
[02:37:41.003 --> 02:37:42.564]  Obama's not being picked up and arrested.
[02:37:42.885 --> 02:37:44.646]  The Bush family's not being picked up and arrested.
[02:37:44.926 --> 02:37:48.968]  Deep state people historically have never faced the consequences of their bad actions.
[02:37:49.028 --> 02:37:51.792]  Yeah, Trump can't even get legal stuff through without the courts challenging him.
[02:37:51.812 --> 02:37:52.713]  So let's go back to our guest.
[02:37:52.733 --> 02:37:53.574]  He made some good points.
[02:37:53.915 --> 02:37:57.180]  And I'll have you back for a full hour just for you to talk The Great Awakening, the book.
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.343]  People should get it at Amazon, wherever else they want to get it.
[02:37:59.783 --> 02:38:01.385]  And he makes some good points from what I've read in the book.
[02:38:02.398 --> 02:38:10.487]  Well, actually, Alex, the reason I was initially talking to Derry is in a couple weeks I'm coming out with my own personal book, which is going to be about Spygate.
[02:38:10.967 --> 02:38:20.517]  And we're real thrilled about that, just trying to do all the characters that are going to be appearing here as the D-class and some of the Pfizer information is let out to the public.
[02:38:21.518 --> 02:38:22.960]  But to answer Mr. Barnes,
[02:38:26.162 --> 02:38:27.243]  Let's look at Mr. Huber.
[02:38:27.263 --> 02:38:30.244]  You talked about John Huber, a special prosecutor out of Utah.
[02:38:31.264 --> 02:38:44.810]  Now, granted that Attorney General Barr just cleared up that he initially had taken a look at everything, and then he stepped back until Horowitz could do things, and then at this point, Barr has assigned all the FISA stuff to Durham.
[02:38:45.450 --> 02:38:52.053]  But what they mentioned, and Attorney General Barr mentioned this, is that Huber's been working on the Clinton Foundation.
[02:38:52.473 --> 02:38:53.114]  From day one.
[02:38:53.154 --> 02:38:56.215]  So that's since November 17 that he's been doing the Clinton Foundation.
[02:38:56.256 --> 02:39:01.639]  And so I say, let's just give it some time before we say that there's been absolutes or nobody's done anything.
[02:39:01.919 --> 02:39:04.160]  One of our adages is future proofs past.
[02:39:04.601 --> 02:39:11.625]  And this is a long game, Alex, especially, you know, people like myself have been fighting since Dallas 63, for truth.
[02:39:13.506 --> 02:39:18.970]  Let's give it a time, you know, and I'm not saying that... Well, I get that history repeats, so...
[02:39:19.770 --> 02:39:21.530]  Right, and then you can just change that adage.
[02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:29.552]  But what about people that say it's like cultic, how it says, as we one go, we all go, or give us some of the other adages, because they just seem like rewrites of other things.
[02:39:29.612 --> 02:39:40.874]  Well, our title that we used, we picked because it was this first book that we did was a collaborative effort by 12 of us, is that we used a old John F. Kennedy saying, which is, where we go one, we go all.
[02:39:40.974 --> 02:39:43.275]  It not only was on his personal yacht bell,
[02:39:43.755 --> 02:39:48.959]  And I have some affinity to the water, but it was also mentioned in White Squall.
[02:39:49.019 --> 02:39:53.503]  Jeff Bridges used that term, and actually they brought in a dummy bell and used the bell.
[02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:58.787]  It's just a saying, and it goes back to President Kennedy, and it's more of a collective effort.
[02:39:59.188 --> 02:40:02.911]  You remember back in the 60s, he was just trying to get us all together as a country to do the right thing.
[02:40:05.013 --> 02:40:06.675]  And I think that's just been a resurgence.
[02:40:06.755 --> 02:40:08.296]  It's just like Make America Great Again.
[02:40:08.336 --> 02:40:12.039]  We're trying to bring back some of the old ways and certainly... Sure, so how does it work?
[02:40:12.139 --> 02:40:17.524]  Because you say you never heard... How do you know who it's the real Q on the channels?
[02:40:17.604 --> 02:40:21.507]  Because you say the real Q says I'm not this evil person.
[02:40:21.527 --> 02:40:24.089]  Well, people in Q's name say I am.
[02:40:24.430 --> 02:40:29.974]  So let me just say Q then... Let's say, for sake of argument, Q knows what Q's talking about.
[02:40:30.615 --> 02:40:32.757]  The actual Q doesn't say I'm bad?
[02:40:34.112 --> 02:40:37.194]  Alex, again, a lot of stuff has been said either way.
[02:40:37.515 --> 02:40:42.558]  And again, I think you're concentrating on something back in April, May that Corsi was involved with.
[02:40:43.398 --> 02:40:45.160]  You know, we're trying to, you know, move on.
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:49.683]  I don't want to depict everything that he said because a lot of the stuff they've said is misinformation.
[02:40:49.723 --> 02:40:59.649]  Just like I said about, I personally believe Mr. Barnes that Sessions is actually going to come out at the end of us being a good guy when we see everything he's done behind the scenes.
[02:40:59.709 --> 02:41:02.331]  Again, we got to give a lot of this stuff time to play out.
[02:41:02.371 --> 02:41:02.931]  There's been no...
[02:41:03.872 --> 02:41:05.173]  Bob, did you say that?
[02:41:05.753 --> 02:41:13.556]  I mean, my view is a much more skeptical view of Sessions, and the reason for that is... I mean, for example, I understand everybody wanting to believe that John Huber was doing good activities.
[02:41:13.876 --> 02:41:14.236]  Two things.
[02:41:14.296 --> 02:41:18.257]  I know Sessions' modus operandi when he was a United States Attorney.
[02:41:18.437 --> 02:41:19.978]  And the second part is with Huber...
[02:41:20.598 --> 02:41:24.380]  IRS criminal investigations is what was purportedly happening with the Clinton Foundation.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:29.283]  The reason why Congressman Meadows called that committee investigation is because he knew Huber wasn't doing anything.
[02:41:30.044 --> 02:41:41.571]  I knew that if it was an IRS criminal investigation in the Clinton Foundation, there's about a 99% chance I would have heard about it because IRS criminal investigations I do more of than almost anything else I do.
[02:41:42.031 --> 02:41:42.752]  Correct, exactly.
[02:41:42.792 --> 02:41:48.096]  And because of the nature of that case, because of the way IRS criminal investigations work, who they subpoena, who they reach out to.
[02:41:48.417 --> 02:41:51.880]  I've been involved in a bunch of IRS whistleblower cases on both sides of the aisle.
[02:41:53.021 --> 02:41:57.925]  There's almost no chance that Huber is doing any meaningful investigation beyond looking at some pieces of paper.
[02:41:58.525 --> 02:42:02.969]  He didn't even know basic information that the whistleblowers had given him, that they were having to call back.
[02:42:03.009 --> 02:42:04.631]  That's the reason why Meadows was so upset.
[02:42:05.091 --> 02:42:17.416]  And so I thought that part of what Q was doing was meant to quiet and silence potential criticism of Sessions by having some of the most informed and passionate people that were in the Q movement misdirect their energies.
[02:42:17.476 --> 02:42:18.897]  And that's where some of the concern came from.
[02:42:18.917 --> 02:42:19.977]  So let me ask this question.
[02:42:19.997 --> 02:42:20.457]  We've got a break.
[02:42:20.497 --> 02:42:24.539]  You can finish up after, Captain Roy D. Yes, sir.
[02:42:24.579 --> 02:42:29.201]  How do you know when it is the real Moses from the mountain, the real tablets?
[02:42:29.601 --> 02:42:31.922]  How do you know on 4chan and 8chan that this is the Q?
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:35.220]  It's like BitChain.
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:40.662]  They have trip codes, and it's just like the same encryption with Bitcoin.
[02:42:41.862 --> 02:42:46.704]  It's encrypted, and it's only one person can have that number, and that's how we've tracked it for the last year and a half.
[02:42:47.224 --> 02:42:51.245]  So 4chan or 8chan, whoever runs those boards, they could never fake that.
[02:42:51.285 --> 02:42:53.566]  They're little sweetsies.
[02:42:53.626 --> 02:43:00.768]  Well, as the experts say, Alex, and again, no one else has come up with being able to duplicate their own number.
[02:43:00.829 --> 02:43:02.089]  So again, you know, I'm not...
[02:43:02.952 --> 02:43:03.512]  Warning!
[02:43:03.912 --> 02:43:09.615]  This broadcast contains subject matter that may offend liberal snowflakes.
[02:43:09.635 --> 02:43:13.097]  I don't give you permission to record me!
[02:43:13.137 --> 02:43:14.197]  You're on live right now!
[02:43:14.217 --> 02:43:15.217]  I don't give you permission!
[02:43:15.257 --> 02:43:22.401]  Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?
[02:43:23.341 --> 02:43:31.565]  Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind!
[02:43:32.449 --> 02:43:35.494]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[02:43:35.514 --> 02:43:38.799]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[02:43:38.819 --> 02:43:42.184]  To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time!
[02:43:42.264 --> 02:43:47.451]  And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[02:43:49.967 --> 02:43:50.908]  Get out of here!
[02:43:51.049 --> 02:43:51.790]  You knocked me!
[02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:53.832]  You thought it was a joke, and so you laughed.
[02:43:53.912 --> 02:43:58.218]  You laughed when I had said that losing you would make me flip my lid.
[02:43:59.119 --> 02:43:59.459]  Right?
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:01.142]  You know you laughed.
[02:44:01.342 --> 02:44:02.263]  I heard you laugh.
[02:44:02.303 --> 02:44:07.430]  You laughed, you laughed and laughed, and then you left, but now you know I'm utterly mad.
[02:44:09.093 --> 02:44:11.335]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[02:44:11.375 --> 02:44:14.157]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[02:44:14.177 --> 02:44:24.706]  To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[02:44:24.726 --> 02:44:26.828]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts!
[02:44:27.028 --> 02:44:34.315]  I cooked your food, I cleaned your house, and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds!
[02:44:36.024 --> 02:44:41.466]  Well, you just wait, they'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the A.S.P.C.
[02:44:41.546 --> 02:44:43.187]  Hey, you mangy mutt!
[02:44:45.487 --> 02:44:47.668]  They're coming to take me away, ha ha ha!
[02:44:47.708 --> 02:44:51.069]  They're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha!
[02:44:51.149 --> 02:44:54.431]  To a funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time!
[02:44:54.491 --> 02:44:59.613]  And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!
[02:45:27.081 --> 02:45:31.184]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:45:45.453 --> 02:45:49.455]  The animated contest of liberty is waiting for you.
[02:45:50.755 --> 02:45:52.816]  But you've got to take it in your hands.
[02:45:53.036 --> 02:45:54.677]  You've got to have the will.
[02:45:56.877 --> 02:46:00.559]  To accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[02:46:01.977 --> 02:46:07.741]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[02:46:07.781 --> 02:46:11.784]  This is the Info War.
[02:46:11.844 --> 02:46:17.187]  They believe that they can attain something if they can destroy the planet before we go to launch fish.
[02:46:17.347 --> 02:46:23.352]  They are just an intergalactic demonic transmission spewed out of hell trying to bring the planet down before the next level.
[02:46:23.392 --> 02:46:26.854]  But we will make the jump, and nothing's going to stop them, and we're going to have a
[02:46:26.974 --> 02:46:27.994]  Pro-human future?
[02:46:28.094 --> 02:46:29.255]  We're not just going interstellar.
[02:46:29.335 --> 02:46:30.295]  We're going interdimensional.
[02:46:30.475 --> 02:46:34.297]  As we travel up this true-sphere way to heaven, people won't want to play video games anymore.
[02:46:34.377 --> 02:46:37.078]  They'll realize this is the real universe, with the real levels.
[02:46:37.278 --> 02:46:38.999]  This is where you want to get that score.
[02:46:39.159 --> 02:46:41.580]  Not in Super Mario Bros., not in Donkey Kong.
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:48.002]  I'm Alex Jones, transmitting from the third dimension, planet Earth, two-thirds of the way out, on the spiral arm, Milky Way Galaxy.
[02:47:05.757 --> 02:47:08.345]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.048 --> 02:47:29.633]  Another time in the age of unwaging war on corruption.
[02:47:30.273 --> 02:47:32.895]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:47:33.695 --> 02:47:38.559]  This broadcast is the Excalibur of the reawakening of the West.
[02:47:38.919 --> 02:47:41.521]  We have pulled the sword from the stone.
[02:47:41.941 --> 02:47:43.702]  We have recharged the Republic.
[02:47:43.942 --> 02:47:45.363]  We have proven in the war.
[02:47:45.423 --> 02:47:46.304]  We are public.
[02:47:46.324 --> 02:47:47.505]  We are starved.
[02:47:53.209 --> 02:47:58.915]  And our listeners are the frontlines that fight.
[02:48:00.512 --> 02:48:03.074]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, writing Shotgun with us.
[02:48:03.274 --> 02:48:07.278]  Author of The Great Awakening, Merchant Marine and Researcher.
[02:48:07.318 --> 02:48:07.878]  Interesting book.
[02:48:08.559 --> 02:48:11.602]  Keelan Onn, an invitation to The Great Awakening.
[02:48:11.622 --> 02:48:12.643]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:48:12.663 --> 02:48:13.443]  I want to take a few calls.
[02:48:14.244 --> 02:48:15.185]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:48:15.225 --> 02:48:24.052]  I'll have you back for a full hour or two just to take calls and really give you the floor to talk about it more because I'm really fascinated because a lot of folks are into this in a way I like it because it gets them looking for political stuff but
[02:48:24.873 --> 02:48:29.598]  You can look in government documents, you can look at actions, you can look at history, you know, instead of 4chan things.
[02:48:29.638 --> 02:48:30.839]  I'm not in competition with 4chan.
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:34.883]  But 4chan and 8chan have launched a lot of famous hoaxes.
[02:48:34.923 --> 02:48:37.445]  The OK symbol, being white supremacist, all of it.
[02:48:37.465 --> 02:48:38.707]  They got a lot of smart folks on there.
[02:48:38.727 --> 02:48:40.769]  It's very interesting, very dynamic stuff.
[02:48:40.889 --> 02:48:41.950]  You know, I'm all for free speech.
[02:48:43.371 --> 02:48:43.551]  But...
[02:48:44.915 --> 02:48:55.862]  Could this not be 4chan or 8chan's greatest hoax where they say, here's this code, the mouth of God speaks from this, and then everybody runs around crazily, you know, after it?
[02:48:56.703 --> 02:49:01.085]  Well, the one thing, Alex, is it's one thing to have the code, but it's another to have the goodies.
[02:49:01.486 --> 02:49:02.266]  And they've had both.
[02:49:02.927 --> 02:49:07.690]  You know, like we've said, and it doesn't matter if it's Lionel or Doug Hagman or John B. Wells.
[02:49:08.450 --> 02:49:09.631]  Was that the goodies, though?
[02:49:09.651 --> 02:49:14.294]  I mean, was it the goodies when they said that Robert Mueller was a good guy?
[02:49:15.086 --> 02:49:25.569]  Well, let's just say that some of this, as I said, some of this is put out, there's a few people that have always been kind of a gray hat that we've not been 100% told either way.
[02:49:26.029 --> 02:49:37.393]  You know, and I'll stand with Hoover and not to be confrontational with Mr. Barnes, but yeah, I believe that Hoover is a good guy and that he'll come up with the goods on the Clinton Foundation.
[02:49:37.453 --> 02:49:39.814]  Speaking of Hoover, what about that standoff at the Hoover Dam?
[02:49:39.834 --> 02:49:40.334]  What happened there?
[02:49:41.570 --> 02:49:45.914]  That's, that's some individual on his own and it's just like everything else.
[02:49:45.954 --> 02:49:49.436]  You'd hate to be, if you had one crazy listener, you'd hate to be tagged to that listener.
[02:49:49.456 --> 02:49:49.917]  No, no, I'm not.
[02:49:50.037 --> 02:49:52.279]  I'm just trying to, he thought there was some cue message there.
[02:49:52.899 --> 02:49:58.684]  There's a lot of people that have been activated, as you know, with your MK Alter and so forth, Alex, with all the history you've done.
[02:49:58.924 --> 02:50:02.267]  There's people been activated and again, they're activating people on both sides.
[02:50:03.528 --> 02:50:04.749]  Look, all I know is...
[02:50:06.806 --> 02:50:19.535]  The so-called Q people say that I'm not talking to Trump, and that all this other stuff's going on, and boy, that's funny then, because I've talked to Trump publicly, I've talked to Trump privately, and I just know that, like, everyone bows down to some anonymous deal.
[02:50:19.916 --> 02:50:20.876]  It just gets a little weird.
[02:50:20.916 --> 02:50:28.742]  Let's go to Lee in Washington, D.C., and Carlos and a few others, and jump at any time here, Captain Davis.
[02:50:29.463 --> 02:50:30.443]  Go ahead.
[02:50:30.563 --> 02:50:30.964]  Is it Lee?
[02:50:30.984 --> 02:50:31.424]  Go ahead.
[02:50:32.285 --> 02:50:33.265]  Yeah, it's Western Indiana.
[02:50:33.285 --> 02:50:33.886]  How you doing, brother?
[02:50:36.338 --> 02:50:37.600]  Go ahead, your phone's a little distorted.
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:38.401]  Go ahead with your question.
[02:50:38.681 --> 02:50:39.722]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[02:50:39.763 --> 02:50:53.219]  You know, my main concern is that a lot of Trump people have learned to be very skeptical of the media and learned to be very skeptical of, for instance, when a news story says, well, an unnamed source told us.
[02:50:54.022 --> 02:50:57.705]  My concern is that Q seems like the ultimate unnamed source.
[02:50:58.026 --> 02:51:00.127]  In fact, they're saying we don't have a name on it.
[02:51:00.588 --> 02:51:07.614]  And so my concern is that a lot of well-meaning people have been... I hear this on the Assange thing all the time.
[02:51:08.074 --> 02:51:17.803]  There are people who believe in the Q thing, who are saying that Assange is not in Belmarsh prison, but he's in fact being in protective custody.
[02:51:18.183 --> 02:51:20.465]  And it's simply not true.
[02:51:20.765 --> 02:51:21.526]  But I would even ask,
[02:51:21.946 --> 02:51:23.426]  What if you're wrong?
[02:51:23.586 --> 02:51:25.987]  If you're wrong, you're misleading people.
[02:51:27.027 --> 02:51:31.868]  If the interpretation of Q is wrong, it's misleading a lot of people, and I see them all the time.
[02:51:32.248 --> 02:51:34.769]  So how does this contribute?
[02:51:34.869 --> 02:51:46.811]  Isn't this getting people to commit exactly the same error that regular people make about CNN and MSNBC all the time, just with a pro-Trump slant?
[02:51:48.038 --> 02:51:49.839]  I have a valid point, sir.
[02:51:49.939 --> 02:52:01.162]  I back you up on that as far as misinformation, but I've not seen anything that has stated on the boards that Julian Assange is in or out or is any specific location.
[02:52:01.222 --> 02:52:04.723]  This would be a few people done interpretations, just like a few people called Alex.
[02:52:04.763 --> 02:52:11.865]  That's not what's appeared on the board, and I guarantee you can look at my Julian Assange article that I have posted, and there's no such
[02:52:13.586 --> 02:52:20.711]  Sure, but if Trump comes on my show, does Trump himself trump a QAnon board?
[02:52:20.851 --> 02:52:23.093]  Or, like, maybe Jehovah is trumped by it.
[02:52:23.133 --> 02:52:27.897]  Like, is there anything in the known universe that trumps a 4chan comment?
[02:52:28.177 --> 02:52:34.322]  Or is that, like, so powerful that it just... Like if 4chan said, everyone kill yourselves, we'd all do it.
[02:52:35.063 --> 02:52:35.964]  No, no, no.
[02:52:36.284 --> 02:52:38.726]  You're misrepresenting all the 4chan stuff.
[02:52:38.766 --> 02:52:43.269]  I mean, everybody that we work with, the QAnon people, we're 100% behind President Trump.
[02:52:43.309 --> 02:52:45.230]  He's the ultimate authority.
[02:52:45.270 --> 02:52:46.451]  That's who we're all with.
[02:52:46.791 --> 02:52:54.356]  We've interpreted that General Flynn, through some of his comments and statements, is that he's
[02:52:54.936 --> 02:52:55.837]  Make America Great Again!
[02:53:15.561 --> 02:53:15.901]  Exactly.
[02:53:15.921 --> 02:53:19.404]  There wouldn't actually be real patriots involved in creating a real InfoWar group.
[02:53:19.764 --> 02:53:21.986]  Thank God there's Q to tell us what it is, though.
[02:53:22.166 --> 02:53:31.093]  Well, I think one thing, to go back to the idea that future explains and justifies prior beliefs, another version of that is past is prologue.
[02:53:31.573 --> 02:53:38.294]  From my experience, I mean, as someone who's a political better and a political gambler, I'm always fine with the various predictions that are made out there.
[02:53:38.334 --> 02:53:40.135]  I always like it when people put money where their mouth is.
[02:53:40.675 --> 02:53:58.859]  And at least in my experience and interface with some of the stronger Q components who use Q as the justification to believe things that I don't find to be likely to be proven true, ultimately, at least as it applies to Mueller, as it applies to Sessions, that part of the Q community that was advancing... Mark Guantanamo.
[02:53:59.179 --> 02:53:59.540]  Exactly.
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:00.882]  Those guys were white hats?
[02:54:01.142 --> 02:54:01.763]  Completely false.
[02:54:02.144 --> 02:54:03.425]  There was no Guantanamo cases?
[02:54:03.486 --> 02:54:04.227]  That was completely false.
[02:54:04.607 --> 02:54:06.049]  There was secret military jurisdiction?
[02:54:06.230 --> 02:54:06.810]  Completely false.
[02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:09.274]  Because at this point, we have got to that future point.
[02:54:09.594 --> 02:54:10.836]  Because Mueller is now retired.
[02:54:10.876 --> 02:54:11.197]  We're gone.
[02:54:11.217 --> 02:54:13.640]  And by the way, we're people that actually talked to the White House.
[02:54:14.241 --> 02:54:20.784]  So it's not like our names aren't known, but I'm not putting this fella down because it's important to cover Q and look at some of the good things, get people thinking.
[02:54:20.804 --> 02:54:29.268]  I'm not beating him up, but at what point do people not understand that there's all this bonafide real stuff going on?
[02:54:29.528 --> 02:54:40.430]  Well, and the only thing I'm recommending to the Q audience is to use their same intellectual capacities and devoted passion to be skeptical of wherever Q is necessarily leading them to be.
[02:54:40.730 --> 02:54:56.354]  So if Q's outcome is, hey, let's be less critical of sessions, let's be less critical of aspects of the press, let's be less public in defense of Assange, then I would be skeptical of whether or not that is a... And that's my next point, because I notice on the board, Lee, is it?
[02:54:56.954 --> 02:54:57.634]  From D.C.
[02:54:58.034 --> 02:54:59.975]  You had a point about Assange real quick for our guest?
[02:55:04.976 --> 02:55:05.536]  Oh, he hung up.
[02:55:06.817 --> 02:55:08.357]  Hey, what do you make of Assange?
[02:55:08.377 --> 02:55:10.378]  Trump said, if you've got the documents, release it.
[02:55:10.998 --> 02:55:13.859]  And then everybody's saying, oh, Assange is great, Assange is wonderful.
[02:55:14.259 --> 02:55:15.779]  Assange reportedly is in the hospital now.
[02:55:16.179 --> 02:55:20.040]  I just as a citizen think Trump should pardon Assange.
[02:55:20.380 --> 02:55:21.901]  I mean, what does Q say?
[02:55:23.483 --> 02:55:26.908]  Q's not really delved into a lot on Julian Assange.
[02:55:27.189 --> 02:55:29.051]  There's just been a few cryptic drops.
[02:55:29.071 --> 02:55:33.818]  That's why I said there's been nothing outlined where he is, what hospital he's in.
[02:55:34.259 --> 02:55:36.261]  What you're referring to is people's interpretations.
[02:55:38.377 --> 02:55:41.119]  I think you have to look at everything as a big picture, Alex.
[02:55:41.179 --> 02:55:43.601]  It's just not one particular item on one particular day.
[02:55:43.961 --> 02:55:45.922]  This is just a confluence of information.
[02:55:46.022 --> 02:55:51.005]  AQ asks us to think for ourselves, to research ourselves, to figure these things out ourselves.
[02:55:51.126 --> 02:55:53.287]  All it is, is pointing us in the right direction.
[02:55:54.014 --> 02:55:57.156]  Um, and letting us explore and find out the real truth.
[02:55:57.196 --> 02:56:05.220]  Now, again, a lot of the information we have is is we know right up front is is maybe misinformation.
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:11.483]  And a lot of this is from the beginning not to be revealed as far as what exactly role.
[02:56:11.503 --> 02:56:14.504]  It'd be nice if we knew from day one sessions role.
[02:56:14.584 --> 02:56:17.265]  It'd be nice if we knew where Assange was and everything else.
[02:56:17.325 --> 02:56:18.406]  I mean, the one thing that we've been
[02:56:19.186 --> 02:56:22.029]  With the boards, with Assange, it's more about Seth Rich.
[02:56:22.629 --> 02:56:24.070]  That's where we've been focusing on.
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:39.086]  We just promote Americana and cut-and-dry issues and values and ideas, and that's how we get out there and change things.
[02:56:39.847 --> 02:56:45.992]  And when it comes to just analyzing what you see in the clouds today, you know, it just leads to what we thought.
[02:56:46.232 --> 02:56:46.872]  We're going to go to break.
[02:56:46.912 --> 02:56:50.896]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last day of the Extended Memorial Day special.
[02:56:51.556 --> 02:56:53.497]  Without you buying our products, we will be shut down.
[02:56:53.517 --> 02:56:57.377]  We're a real organization with real people, real names, and we have the best fish oil.
[02:56:57.417 --> 02:56:59.698]  We have the best turmeric bodies formula.
[02:56:59.918 --> 02:57:01.879]  It's 60 to 40% off storewide.
[02:57:02.319 --> 02:57:04.459]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:04.519 --> 02:57:05.380]  It's got to end.
[02:57:05.700 --> 02:57:09.020]  You can pre-order your new Space Force shirt.
[02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:10.561]  It's so popular, I knew it would be a big hit.
[02:57:10.941 --> 02:57:12.561]  People are getting a lot of them, so that's great.
[02:57:12.861 --> 02:57:14.482]  High quality fabric, made in America.
[02:57:15.382 --> 02:57:16.083]  Printed in America.
[02:57:16.103 --> 02:57:17.606]  We're really, really proud of this new shirt.
[02:57:17.686 --> 02:57:19.889]  Red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder.
[02:57:20.029 --> 02:57:23.134]  It is a designer quality shirt and a collector's item.
[02:57:23.174 --> 02:57:23.976]  It's going to be a limited edition.
[02:57:26.457 --> 02:57:32.181]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139, Space Force shirt.
[02:57:32.722 --> 02:57:35.143]  Now available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:35.764 --> 02:57:40.827]  Fourth hour with Gerald Cilente, your calls, Carlos, Sandy, Vanessa, Steve, Frank, and more.
[02:57:41.388 --> 02:57:44.330]  Straight ahead on the other side, Infowars.com.
[02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:46.291]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:57:46.411 --> 02:57:46.832]  Stay with us.
[02:57:56.857 --> 02:57:58.799]  The dodo is an extinct bird.
[02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:02.003]  Big, fat, juicy, delicious birds the size of a turkey.
[02:58:02.163 --> 02:58:03.284]  They never had a predator.
[02:58:03.304 --> 02:58:05.967]  There weren't any wolves, there weren't any foxes, there weren't any dogs.
[02:58:05.987 --> 02:58:08.030]  There's nothing but these birds running around on this island.
[02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:12.595]  And within just a few years of sailors finding the island, whaling ships would go stop there.
[02:58:13.596 --> 02:58:17.219]  They just walk up with a boar and just club him in the head and eat him.
[02:58:17.259 --> 02:58:18.220]  Big ol' fat juicy meal.
[02:58:18.380 --> 02:58:21.003]  So the dodo... People call people a dodo.
[02:58:21.023 --> 02:58:23.865]  They're stupid and don't care about themselves and fall off the edge of a cliff.
[02:58:23.885 --> 02:58:24.346]  They're stupid.
[02:58:24.406 --> 02:58:26.388]  But it was they'd never seen humans.
[02:58:26.428 --> 02:58:27.629]  They'd never had a predator.
[02:58:27.749 --> 02:58:28.970]  They had no fear.
[02:58:29.050 --> 02:58:29.851]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:58:30.151 --> 02:58:30.952]  If I was a chicken...
[02:58:31.252 --> 02:58:32.793]  I'm running around like my head's cut off.
[02:58:32.953 --> 02:58:34.034]  And you know why I feel like that?
[02:58:34.074 --> 02:58:34.694]  Why I'm pissed?
[02:58:34.915 --> 02:58:37.036]  Because my instincts are lined up and normal.
[02:58:37.096 --> 02:58:38.237]  We have world government.
[02:58:38.277 --> 02:58:40.498]  We have Democrats saying they're killing babies after they're born.
[02:58:40.598 --> 02:58:42.560]  We have sex education to five-year-olds.
[02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:45.582]  We have total evil Hollywood demoralizing us.
[02:58:45.622 --> 02:58:46.802]  They attack on the family.
[02:58:46.882 --> 02:58:47.643]  All these lies.
[02:58:47.763 --> 02:58:52.286]  We have criminal collapse news networks calling anyone that doesn't submit to them Nazis.
[02:58:52.426 --> 02:58:56.309]  And then using their fake claim that you're a Nazi to have your bank accounts taken.
[02:58:56.369 --> 02:58:57.329]  That's what the Nazis did.
[02:58:57.490 --> 02:59:00.852]  And as a man, I become physically angry at this point.
[02:59:01.152 --> 02:59:04.535]  If you don't fundamentally get pissed at that, you're a dodo bird.
[02:59:04.715 --> 02:59:05.937]  Folks, I'm not a dodo bird.
[02:59:06.057 --> 02:59:07.598]  And I'm not going to compare myself to an eagle.
[02:59:07.718 --> 02:59:09.880]  Let me just compare myself to a chicken.
[02:59:10.221 --> 02:59:13.304]  Chicken sees a hawk fly over, that chicken runs for the bushes.
[02:59:14.225 --> 02:59:17.167]  That chicken goes... To tell others, hey...
[02:59:17.788 --> 02:59:19.590]  The hawk that eats us, he just flew over.
[02:59:19.811 --> 02:59:27.219]  You see, the Dodos were on that island for probably millions of years, and nothing ever ate them, at least hundreds of thousands, so they didn't have a race memory.
[02:59:27.279 --> 02:59:34.548]  But you can take a chicken or any other creature that's ever been around predators, and they know about predators, they know what they look like, even though
[02:59:41.195 --> 02:59:43.557]  We're good to go.
[03:00:07.611 --> 03:00:09.292]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.913 --> 03:00:11.514]  Just a good old boy.
[03:00:11.634 --> 03:00:12.855]  Never meanin' no harm.
[03:00:13.296 --> 03:00:14.777]  Never meanin' no harm.
[03:00:17.519 --> 03:00:19.040]  Beats all you never saw.
[03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:22.223]  Been in trouble with the law since the day they were born.
[03:00:24.444 --> 03:00:25.625]  Straightenin' the curve.
[03:00:27.667 --> 03:00:27.867]  Yeah.
[03:00:27.887 --> 03:00:29.068]  Climbin' the hills.
[03:00:29.228 --> 03:00:30.689]  Someday.
[03:00:31.550 --> 03:00:35.173]  Someday the mountain might get up, but the law never will.
[03:00:37.529 --> 03:00:38.089]  Woo!
[03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:41.452]  Yeah, I'm good friends with Shooter Jennings.
[03:00:41.492 --> 03:00:42.433]  Not name-dropping.
[03:00:42.853 --> 03:00:43.693]  I'm a real person!
[03:00:43.714 --> 03:00:47.136]  I've been around 25 years on air.
[03:00:48.117 --> 03:00:51.419]  Everybody questions who I am and what I really stand for, even though the proof's in the pudding.
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:54.822]  Listen, I want this QAnon thing to be real.
[03:00:54.982 --> 03:00:55.322]  It's great.
[03:00:55.342 --> 03:00:56.503]  People have a right to do whatever they want.
[03:00:56.583 --> 03:01:02.027]  I have a right to counter it because I've gotten a lot of stiff criticism out of it.
[03:01:02.147 --> 03:01:06.330]  And the biggest thing I get to someone that calls himself a Q Scholar
[03:01:09.283 --> 03:01:16.067]  If that's the term you use, a Q scribe, is it's like a fortune cookie or a fortune teller.
[03:01:17.027 --> 03:01:20.229]  And it's just all nebulous, so I get how people's brains like that.
[03:01:21.403 --> 03:01:23.644]  But I'm in the real world dealing with this stuff.
[03:01:23.964 --> 03:01:26.085]  I know I'm not an Israeli agent.
[03:01:26.105 --> 03:01:27.786]  I know I'm talking to the President.
[03:01:27.846 --> 03:01:30.948]  I know I'm coordinating with... I mean, I'm actually... Does anybody hear about Q?
[03:01:30.988 --> 03:01:32.608]  Like, I'm going to D.C.
[03:01:32.688 --> 03:01:35.470]  I'm in rooms with real intelligence operatives that are patriots.
[03:01:35.490 --> 03:01:38.831]  They're asking me for reports and ideas and, you know, for the President.
[03:01:38.851 --> 03:01:41.773]  And not because I'm that important, but because we're just brainstorming.
[03:01:42.608 --> 03:01:43.709]  And I've got a giant audience.
[03:01:44.330 --> 03:01:46.592]  So I'm really doing the real stuff.
[03:01:46.632 --> 03:01:47.733]  I've been doing it a long time.
[03:01:47.753 --> 03:01:51.416]  And then I just watched some nebulous thing on a 4chan channel.
[03:01:52.157 --> 03:01:53.538]  Tell me how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:01:53.558 --> 03:02:00.425]  And I think that's where people get frustrated, Captain Roy D. Well, nobody's trying to outdo each other.
[03:02:00.605 --> 03:02:02.667]  And everybody knows you've been around a while.
[03:02:02.707 --> 03:02:03.648]  Alex, I listen to you.
[03:02:03.728 --> 03:02:05.049]  I'm a follower.
[03:02:08.567 --> 03:02:11.268]  There's reverence and there's credit to be given for history.
[03:02:11.288 --> 03:02:12.608]  Mother, I don't want reverence.
[03:02:12.728 --> 03:02:16.830]  I'm just here to tell people Trump doesn't want me arrested and put in Guantanamo.
[03:02:17.490 --> 03:02:20.611]  Well, it's never been on the cue board, that statement.
[03:02:20.651 --> 03:02:25.993]  You know, again, a lot of this stuff's been warped around, and again, all I could say is that there's... But that's why it's all nebulous.
[03:02:26.053 --> 03:02:33.236]  I tell people the President's planning to prosecute the deep state and do antitrust things a year ago and a month ago, and then it happens.
[03:02:33.296 --> 03:02:34.356]  I mean, this is real stuff.
[03:02:35.205 --> 03:02:36.467]  I've written the same stuff.
[03:02:36.507 --> 03:02:39.871]  I mean, I've written the same stuff and been on Doug Hagman a year ago saying the same stuff.
[03:02:39.891 --> 03:02:42.455]  We're all on the same page, Alex, and it's really not a competition.
[03:02:42.475 --> 03:02:44.217]  I'm not in a competition.
[03:02:44.237 --> 03:02:50.265]  You've got to understand is that I don't go out and sow dissent with patriot leaders out there.
[03:02:50.706 --> 03:02:52.769]  If somebody's promoting Americana, I have them on and back them.
[03:02:53.737 --> 03:02:53.917]  Yeah.
[03:02:53.997 --> 03:02:58.662]  I mean look, Matt Drudge, the last interview he gave three years ago, very reclusive, was here.
[03:02:59.243 --> 03:03:01.785]  Matt Drudge is at the White House all the time advising the President.
[03:03:02.366 --> 03:03:05.028]  You think, is Matt Drudge real?
[03:03:05.048 --> 03:03:06.450]  I mean, is Matt Drudge important?
[03:03:07.472 --> 03:03:09.033]  No, all these guys are important, Alex.
[03:03:09.073 --> 03:03:09.974]  All these people are important.
[03:03:09.994 --> 03:03:11.015]  We're not trying to say somebody's not important.
[03:03:11.035 --> 03:03:14.518]  But if he was trying to launch a second fiddle, though, like at the Last Supper, he'd be at the end of the table, though, right?
[03:03:14.558 --> 03:03:15.498]  Right?
[03:03:15.598 --> 03:03:18.020]  No, it's not even a question of you're trying to put a hierarchy on this.
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:19.501]  No, but I mean, I've got Trump on.
[03:03:19.621 --> 03:03:20.682]  I've got Matt Grudge on.
[03:03:20.842 --> 03:03:21.363]  I'm real.
[03:03:21.483 --> 03:03:22.644]  I relaunched the Patriot Movement.
[03:03:22.944 --> 03:03:24.285]  I'm not bragging here.
[03:03:24.645 --> 03:03:27.267]  I'm just saying along comes the royalty of Q.
[03:03:28.428 --> 03:03:31.229]  And it just tells me that I'm this anti-American.
[03:03:31.489 --> 03:03:33.971]  And let me tell you, for a lot of generations, that's not what's been going on.
[03:03:34.311 --> 03:03:39.033]  We've been doing a lot of stuff, writing books and financing things and killing people for this country.
[03:03:39.553 --> 03:03:44.975]  My family's been killing people for 240 plus years for this country, brother.
[03:03:45.255 --> 03:03:46.056]  Killing people!
[03:03:46.316 --> 03:03:47.837]  Doing a lot of dangerous stuff.
[03:03:48.137 --> 03:03:52.899]  And people come along that won't say who their name is and accuse me of being a goddamn Russian agent.
[03:03:53.079 --> 03:03:54.119]  I'll come after their ass!
[03:03:54.319 --> 03:03:55.300]  Do you understand that?
[03:03:56.811 --> 03:03:58.312]  Certainly, I understand threats, Alex.
[03:03:58.652 --> 03:04:00.133]  No, it's not a threat to you!
[03:04:00.473 --> 03:04:06.396]  I'm telling all these shadowy people jerking their ding-dongs out there that this is the real world.
[03:04:06.916 --> 03:04:08.697]  This isn't a place for message boards.
[03:04:09.177 --> 03:04:11.978]  Where is Q confronting the head of Google?
[03:04:12.539 --> 03:04:15.300]  Where is Q confronting the head of Facebook at point-blank range?
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:17.341]  What do you think they do when you do that?
[03:04:17.461 --> 03:04:19.342]  Where are these people in the streets?
[03:04:19.842 --> 03:04:21.263]  I want to see Q!
[03:04:21.603 --> 03:04:23.284]  I want to see his power!
[03:04:23.304 --> 03:04:25.425]  I want to see him on the street!
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:29.746]  Alex, I'm sorry Mr. Barnes isn't there anymore, but he'll appreciate it.
[03:04:29.846 --> 03:04:37.218]  I've been already in touch with Todd McNaughtry and Mr. Lynn who are spearheading... Barnes said he did not endorse that guy out of Utah you brought up.
[03:04:38.646 --> 03:04:38.926]  Pardon?
[03:04:40.067 --> 03:04:42.269]  I didn't ask him to endorse them, I just told my opinion.
[03:04:42.289 --> 03:04:48.193]  I'm just telling you here, I am, here's the thing, I respect something, I don't like Hillary Clinton, but I respect her because she's public.
[03:04:48.874 --> 03:04:50.895]  I do not, I respect you because you're public.
[03:04:51.176 --> 03:04:52.777]  I respect your book, that's why you're on.
[03:04:53.617 --> 03:04:55.059]  You have your new book come out, I want you on.
[03:04:55.439 --> 03:05:01.704]  I'm telling you though, I don't like people saying that I'm an anti-American traitor when it's not true.
[03:05:03.325 --> 03:05:04.646]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:05:06.024 --> 03:05:12.146]  We are only here because you support us, and I thank you, and I appreciate you, and I salute you.
[03:05:13.146 --> 03:05:27.891]  In honor of Memorial Day, we are launching game-changing specials and unveiling a brand new system for the total health and performance that has been in design and research and development for over a year.
[03:05:28.671 --> 03:05:31.512]  It's called the 8-Pack Power Stack.
[03:05:32.492 --> 03:05:35.113]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[03:05:35.814 --> 03:05:35.113]  $59.95.
[03:05:36.274 --> 03:05:38.735]  No one can top the 8-pack Power Stack.
[03:05:39.115 --> 03:05:39.736]  Daily Care.
[03:05:40.036 --> 03:05:40.376]  No one.
[03:05:40.436 --> 03:05:43.057]  There's nothing better for total, complete everything.
[03:05:43.417 --> 03:05:44.058]  It's incredible.
[03:05:44.278 --> 03:05:47.039]  It's 50% off out of the gates and a bunch of other specials.
[03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:53.382]  Commit today to tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show and commit to get some great products.

[03:05:59.205 --> 03:06:00.206]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:06:13.726 --> 03:06:18.867]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:06:19.367 --> 03:06:21.767]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.028 --> 03:06:25.388]  Alright, again, Roy Davis is a very nice person.
[03:06:25.408 --> 03:06:28.149]  He's been very gentlemanly, and I've already read a few chapters of his book.
[03:06:28.169 --> 03:06:32.710]  A lot of it's good points, and I thought Q was healthy just to question things and look into things.
[03:06:33.350 --> 03:06:35.290]  And I appreciate him coming on, so I'm not mad at him.
[03:06:35.310 --> 03:06:40.351]  I'm just irritated that I know what's going on.
[03:06:41.397 --> 03:06:45.901]  The president has told me many times, press the attack, keep it up, great job.
[03:06:46.522 --> 03:06:49.304]  And I hear people claiming on 4chan they speak for the president.
[03:06:49.645 --> 03:06:51.006]  They don't have interviews with the president.
[03:06:51.446 --> 03:06:54.950]  They don't have CNN saying it's the Trump-influenced presidency.
[03:06:55.430 --> 03:07:02.857]  So in closing, I want to take a few phone calls here and invite you back with your new book coming up soon with other points about QAnon and where this whole thing's going.
[03:07:04.983 --> 03:07:07.445]  Well, the boards haven't been saying that, Alex.
[03:07:07.745 --> 03:07:10.488]  I mean, there's a lot of misrepresentation here going on.
[03:07:10.508 --> 03:07:13.730]  I think that's all part of it, is that the boards have not come out and said that.
[03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:16.052]  Okay, so maybe the left, then, misrepresents QAnon.
[03:07:16.072 --> 03:07:19.756]  So QAnon, whoever QAnon is, needs to come out and say that, you know...
[03:07:20.496 --> 03:07:23.137]  The Main Street Media has been on us since day one.
[03:07:23.177 --> 03:07:26.098]  I mean, there's thousands and thousands of negative articles.
[03:07:26.158 --> 03:07:35.702]  I mean, Lester Holt from NBC Nightly News did a hit piece on me in this book just a few months ago, and I had all these calls from these... No, you're right, and that's why I agreed with QAnon early on.
[03:07:35.742 --> 03:07:37.142]  I talked to people I knew in the Pentagon.
[03:07:37.482 --> 03:07:38.743]  They said, we don't know what it is.
[03:07:38.763 --> 03:07:47.486]  We think it's some guys that have some knowledge and maybe like a 4chan prank, but at least they're getting the ball going that we're going to arrest the Deep State because that's the right thing to do.
[03:07:48.546 --> 03:07:49.666]  It's got everybody thinking.
[03:07:49.827 --> 03:07:51.787]  It's got everybody... No, I agree with that.
[03:07:51.807 --> 03:07:55.308]  And so, maybe it was Corsi triggered it all against me.
[03:07:55.368 --> 03:07:57.689]  I'm just sick of being accused of being a traitor when I'm not.
[03:07:58.449 --> 03:08:00.630]  Well, there's a lot to be said.
[03:08:00.690 --> 03:08:07.912]  I'm not going to argue with that because I tell you, Corsi's been... I had problems with Jerry Corsi back in March when he blew up our first Summit at Reddit.
[03:08:07.972 --> 03:08:10.553]  The calm before the storm was before the Great Awakening Summit.
[03:08:10.573 --> 03:08:12.373]  Yeah, I don't want to put... I don't want to attack Corsi.
[03:08:12.413 --> 03:08:14.114]  He sued me and stuff over things I didn't do.
[03:08:14.694 --> 03:08:16.876]  So it's all been a very, it's like eating a dirt sandwich.
[03:08:16.956 --> 03:08:22.920]  It's just, okay, well then maybe you can come to town then and we can meet for a few hours too and come on air because I know you're a prominent guy.
[03:08:22.940 --> 03:08:23.640]  People respect you.
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:30.605]  I just know I have been kicked in the teeth by QAnon for no damn reason and I am not a damn Russian spy that's about to be put in prison.
[03:08:31.431 --> 03:08:38.937]  Well, one of our goals, Alex, is that, and I explained this to some other people when I said I was going on your show, I said eventually we've got to bring all the leftists over.
[03:08:38.957 --> 03:08:45.603]  This is one country, we're all American, so, you know, I said let's just mend all the bridges and get everything put to bed first.
[03:08:45.663 --> 03:08:47.224]  Let's start with our alt-media crowd.
[03:08:47.264 --> 03:08:51.468]  There's been a lot of people that have embraced this and there's been some people that have been resistant from Q4.
[03:08:51.568 --> 03:08:54.490]  No, no, I mean, I agree with you and I really want to find out what this is.
[03:08:54.530 --> 03:08:56.312]  So if I've been discharging a lot of
[03:08:57.132 --> 03:08:58.154]  Uh, negativity on you.
[03:08:58.174 --> 03:08:58.735]  I apologize.
[03:08:58.755 --> 03:08:59.516]  You've been a gentleman.
[03:08:59.877 --> 03:09:06.909]  I apologize to you, but all the other people making up stuff, like I got pissed off at, you know, Congressman Schiff saying I'm a Russian agent.
[03:09:06.949 --> 03:09:10.234]  You know, I can't help but get mad when I'm accused of things I haven't done.
[03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:12.730]  Schiff will get his, not to worry.
[03:09:13.210 --> 03:09:13.971]  His day's coming.
[03:09:14.131 --> 03:09:20.815]  Well, no, I mean, if one thing Q's been right about is these prosecutions, we've been saying it before, Q existed, but Q's definitely right on that front.
[03:09:20.835 --> 03:09:22.936]  Let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[03:09:22.996 --> 03:09:26.078]  You're on the air with a leading QAnon scholar.
[03:09:26.458 --> 03:09:27.179]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:09:27.579 --> 03:09:28.880]  I'm just a writer, not a scholar.
[03:09:28.900 --> 03:09:29.540]  I'm just a writer.
[03:09:31.101 --> 03:09:31.641]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:09:33.122 --> 03:09:33.923]  On the question of Q,
[03:09:35.765 --> 03:09:45.870]  I am a scientist by training, and I have also, like you, been reading history, well, since I was 18 years old, none dare call it conspiracy, if you know that.
[03:09:46.370 --> 03:09:50.712]  So I find that when I heard of Q for the first time, I was interested.
[03:09:50.732 --> 03:09:51.992]  I said, OK, what is this?
[03:09:52.412 --> 03:10:00.496]  And I looked into it, and the claim was made that it was a source claiming to have a top secret clearance.
[03:10:01.156 --> 03:10:03.617]  Now, when I heard that, I said, that's a fact.
[03:10:04.147 --> 03:10:06.328]  Then let's, this is reliable, that's good.
[03:10:06.528 --> 03:10:07.328]  Let's listen to it.
[03:10:07.848 --> 03:10:18.030]  The question is, how do you establish over time whether the source, claiming to have a top secret clearance, is giving people factual evidence or not?
[03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:24.532]  I've found that I wasn't getting the thesis supported by the evidence.
[03:10:25.052 --> 03:10:29.513]  And if you look at, for instance, just back on February 18,
[03:10:30.788 --> 03:10:32.329]  January 18 and so on.
[03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:35.252]  You find claims were being made that never panned out.
[03:10:35.592 --> 03:10:48.043]  Now, there were claims that someone who had a top-secret clearance would have known, and even if they were cased in mystery or questions, as steel or cubes, at least they should pan out.
[03:10:48.576 --> 03:10:52.397]  And when they don't pan out a year later, then you wonder, hey, what's going on?
[03:10:52.737 --> 03:10:54.877]  What's this top clearance relationship?
[03:10:54.897 --> 03:11:00.459]  And by the way, Carlos, I'm not tooting my horn, but we're hated by the establishment because we get historical trends.
[03:11:00.979 --> 03:11:03.519]  I said Trump will be elected, populists will be elected everywhere.
[03:11:03.959 --> 03:11:06.280]  We'll have a new renaissance worldwide if we want it.
[03:11:06.660 --> 03:11:13.021]  I just believe that humanity saw the different forces and had a big enough audience to believe we could set the chain reaction.
[03:11:14.101 --> 03:11:16.122]  That's something that actually came true, Carlos.
[03:11:17.110 --> 03:11:37.566]  That's right, and that's why I believe with all my heart that facts and history together may sound at first like a conspiracy, but the victory of truth is that once a conspiracy is shown to be factually, to be historically true, which is the case with Infowars, and that's why I call your program, okay?
[03:11:37.806 --> 03:11:39.287]  Because I'll give you a little prediction.
[03:11:39.827 --> 03:11:44.271]  We've been doing analysis now for two and a half years about Hillary Clinton, and I
[03:11:44.795 --> 03:11:45.215]  I think so.
[03:12:09.981 --> 03:12:10.722]  Exactly.
[03:12:10.742 --> 03:12:12.444]  She's done it in the past.
[03:12:12.724 --> 03:12:15.166]  She's run before saying, oh this is just a political attack.
[03:12:15.186 --> 03:12:15.767]  I agree with you.
[03:12:15.807 --> 03:12:16.467]  Carlos, great points.
[03:12:16.508 --> 03:12:19.210]  Roy Davis, one of the authors of The Great Awakening, go ahead.
[03:12:19.230 --> 03:12:20.291]  Your point on that.
[03:12:35.086 --> 03:12:38.068]  Well no, I was disagreeing with Carlos about the conspiracy thing.
[03:12:38.148 --> 03:12:44.911]  I think myself and all the anons I work with are 100% behind you as far as your premise.
[03:12:44.931 --> 03:12:48.993]  And I think what we have to do is just give it a little bit more time to pan out.
[03:12:49.334 --> 03:12:54.096]  A lot of the specifics, like I mentioned to Alex right in the beginning, some of this is misinformation.
[03:12:54.176 --> 03:12:59.339]  Not a lot of it, but we knew from the get-go 100% wasn't going to be right because some of it was to feint.
[03:12:59.959 --> 03:13:04.742]  To throw the people off the trail about what really was going to be the plan, especially on big moves.
[03:13:04.802 --> 03:13:07.143]  And that's that's again, that's that's President Trump's M.O.
[03:13:07.503 --> 03:13:15.728]  And I think if we just give it a little bit of time and see how things turn out, we'll be able to better judge and you'll be able to fill in your statistics.
[03:13:15.748 --> 03:13:16.948]  And I think you'll be proven right.
[03:13:16.968 --> 03:13:18.789]  All right.
[03:13:18.809 --> 03:13:20.650]  Let's go to Vanessa in Texas.
[03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:21.611]  You're on the air with our guests.
[03:13:21.651 --> 03:13:22.171]  Go ahead, Vanessa.
[03:13:22.191 --> 03:13:22.711]  Thanks for holding.
[03:13:24.272 --> 03:13:25.473]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[03:13:25.613 --> 03:13:29.195]  I just wanted to say you went to high school with my cousin, so I know you're not Bill Hicks.
[03:13:29.938 --> 03:13:31.061]  I don't think so.
[03:13:42.452 --> 03:13:49.454]  You know, points the finger at, and there's great information in there, and I believe it teaches people how to research, and for that, it's useful.
[03:13:49.894 --> 03:13:51.534]  I've been listening to you for 20 years.
[03:13:51.694 --> 03:14:03.597]  I think that you're spot on with your analysis, and I believe that QAnon is spot on with the direction that he sends people, you know, to research, and for that, it's helpful.
[03:14:03.717 --> 03:14:10.459]  For that, it's a tool to wake people up, and I think that, unfortunately, people have taken
[03:14:11.169 --> 03:14:11.269]  Okay.
[03:14:23.354 --> 03:14:27.195]  Um, you know, the Q movement and his analysis of the Q post.
[03:14:27.415 --> 03:14:33.217]  And I think just you got tied up in that web and guilty by association in a lot of people's eyes.
[03:14:33.277 --> 03:14:35.177]  And I think it's unfair to you.
[03:14:35.197 --> 03:14:38.298]  Um, I think you're making a really good point here.
[03:14:38.338 --> 03:14:39.558]  So I've been emotional about this.
[03:14:39.578 --> 03:14:40.318]  I apologize.
[03:14:40.518 --> 03:14:41.759]  Your guess is nice and you're nice.
[03:14:42.199 --> 03:14:44.159]  All the Q followers I meet are really smart.
[03:14:44.179 --> 03:14:48.280]  And I think it is good to get people thinking, but I'm not getting into Corsi, but amen to that.
[03:14:48.780 --> 03:14:49.941]  It's whatever that guy's up to.
[03:14:49.981 --> 03:14:50.641]  I'm not part of it.
[03:14:51.784 --> 03:14:52.885]  I agree with the caller.
[03:14:52.925 --> 03:14:54.767]  She's spot on, Alex, 100%.
[03:14:55.308 --> 03:14:57.490]  That's the direction.
[03:14:57.531 --> 03:14:59.633]  And again, I think everything can be worked out.
[03:14:59.673 --> 03:15:09.544]  I mean, our goal is part of this digital, that General Flynn described as our army of digital soldiers, part of the thing is just not informational, but as far as comforting.
[03:15:09.944 --> 03:15:16.849]  You know, when the person Carlos mentioned about Hillary getting arrested, you know, we suspect that there's some things like this in the future.
[03:15:17.570 --> 03:15:21.473]  And again, we have to comfort the people that quite... Well, let's do one more segment and then Gerald Salinas is taking over.
[03:15:21.513 --> 03:15:22.474]  I promise a little more calls.
[03:15:22.514 --> 03:15:25.616]  But Vanessa, you talked about me growing up in Rockwall, Texas.
[03:15:25.636 --> 03:15:26.577]  What were you saying about that?
[03:15:27.935 --> 03:15:29.477]  You went to high school with my cousins.
[03:15:30.037 --> 03:15:31.719]  So I know you're not Bill Hicks.
[03:15:31.799 --> 03:15:36.725]  I know that you grew up in Rockwall and they've known you since y'all were kids together.
[03:15:36.785 --> 03:15:39.127]  And they've also got that new NPR piece out.
[03:15:39.968 --> 03:15:41.229]  Totally fake about me growing up.
[03:15:41.349 --> 03:15:42.210]  Totally made up.
[03:15:42.851 --> 03:15:44.393]  So they're just hitting me on every front.
[03:15:45.956 --> 03:15:50.678]  Well, I just want to say God bless you, God bless Donald Trump, and thank you for everything you do.
[03:15:50.718 --> 03:15:51.738]  Your products are wonderful.
[03:15:51.778 --> 03:15:52.298]  We love you Alex.
[03:15:52.318 --> 03:15:52.819]  God bless you.
[03:15:53.139 --> 03:15:56.700]  Yeah, I found out they tried to get women to say I raped them, but they couldn't get anybody to do it.
[03:15:57.080 --> 03:15:59.801]  That's how criminal NPR is.
[03:15:59.841 --> 03:16:00.481]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:11.405 --> 03:16:12.526]  Now, normally,
[03:16:13.493 --> 03:16:21.781]  When I drink Turbo Force, I usually like to drink it before the war room and I get a kick and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[03:16:21.801 --> 03:16:23.082]  I get a workout in and everything.
[03:16:23.662 --> 03:16:27.506]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some Brain Force Plus.
[03:16:27.586 --> 03:16:36.013]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[03:16:36.314 --> 03:16:39.356]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[03:16:40.177 --> 03:16:41.077]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:41.117 --> 03:16:48.940]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:49.300 --> 03:16:50.521]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[03:16:50.601 --> 03:16:51.421]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[03:16:51.461 --> 03:16:53.022]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[03:16:53.082 --> 03:16:57.143]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[03:16:57.383 --> 03:16:58.784]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[03:16:58.904 --> 03:17:02.727]  Me stirring a cup of Turbo Force has never looked so good.
[03:17:03.047 --> 03:17:08.671]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out of Turbo Force with this one, folks, so you better go to InfoWarsTore.com immediately, alright?
[03:17:08.711 --> 03:17:09.351]  You think I got it?
[03:17:09.411 --> 03:17:11.873]  Look at the Turbo Force spinning so eloquently.
[03:17:12.073 --> 03:17:15.956]  Nothing to disturb it, just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[03:17:16.156 --> 03:17:21.960]  Yes, ah, I'm thinking of my Turbo Force and how great it's going to make me feel.
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:28.869]  And the pure energy that I'm gonna get from my turbo force at Infowarstore.com.
[03:17:29.890 --> 03:17:30.291]  Yes.
[03:17:30.311 --> 03:17:32.494]  Total equilibrium.
[03:17:34.261 --> 03:17:35.501]  Find your chi.
[03:17:35.722 --> 03:17:39.723]  Find the energy with TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:17:40.503 --> 03:17:43.924]  I'm getting ready for a long four-hour broadcast and I need my energy.
[03:17:43.944 --> 03:17:52.627]  I'm sipping TurboForce mixed with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:53.607 --> 03:17:54.308]  It's magic.
[03:17:55.288 --> 03:17:58.349]  It's TurboForce from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:18:05.800 --> 03:18:11.721]  Del Bigtree is joining me right now, and I'm very excited because he's got a big crowd of people behind him.
[03:18:11.781 --> 03:18:17.242]  Here, organically, Del Bigtree is able to get hundreds of people to turn out to stop medical tyranny.
[03:18:17.262 --> 03:18:18.123]  Guys, let's show this.
[03:18:18.583 --> 03:18:20.583]  Look at that.
[03:18:20.863 --> 03:18:21.503]  That's right!
[03:18:22.103 --> 03:18:25.184]  That's what America sounds like when they're pissed off!
[03:18:25.204 --> 03:18:27.225]  Yeah!
[03:18:27.605 --> 03:18:28.985]  That's just beautiful right there.
[03:18:30.026 --> 03:18:31.487]  All right, thank you!
[03:18:31.507 --> 03:18:32.748]  Isn't that awesome?
[03:18:33.249 --> 03:18:34.109]  Isn't that awesome?
[03:18:34.149 --> 03:18:37.392]  These are all parents of, you know, people of unvaccinated children.
[03:18:37.712 --> 03:18:39.093]  Others have injured children.
[03:18:39.474 --> 03:18:40.955]  I call them the ex-vaxxers.
[03:18:40.995 --> 03:18:45.259]  They try to group everybody into one slur word saying we're anti-vaxxers.
[03:18:45.599 --> 03:18:49.362]  We are pro-science, we are pro-health, and science shows that unvaccinated
[03:18:49.642 --> 03:18:50.403]  I have proof of it!
[03:19:10.461 --> 03:19:11.101]  Proven to be safe?
[03:19:11.341 --> 03:19:13.462]  Highest rates of childhood cancer we've ever seen.
[03:19:13.502 --> 03:19:15.823]  Highest rates of childhood diabetes we've ever seen.
[03:19:16.063 --> 03:19:19.324]  Highest rates of autism we've ever seen and other neurological disorders.
[03:19:19.504 --> 03:19:21.024]  Highest rates of multiple sclerosis.
[03:19:21.244 --> 03:19:22.525]  ADD, ADHD.
[03:19:22.625 --> 03:19:25.366]  All of our special needs classes are exploding in our schools.
[03:19:25.626 --> 03:19:27.546]  You're telling me that this system's working?
[03:19:27.766 --> 03:19:35.849]  This is the sickest generation of children this country has ever seen, all under the watchful eye of the CDC and the pediatricians of America.
[03:19:35.869 --> 03:19:39.450]  I don't have to listen to you because you suck at your job.
[03:19:43.305 --> 03:19:45.006]  That's America right there, folks.
[03:19:45.447 --> 03:19:46.588]  That's America right there.
[03:19:46.688 --> 03:19:51.572]  Families who are not going to have their God-given rights taken away by medical tyranny.
[03:19:54.674 --> 03:19:59.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.689 --> 03:20:27.911]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[03:20:36.371 --> 03:20:38.832]  And I won't ever take you back.
[03:20:39.692 --> 03:20:40.552]  Alright, we're almost out of time.
[03:20:40.572 --> 03:20:41.853]  Joe Solente is loaded for bear.
[03:20:42.293 --> 03:20:42.993]  Next two segments.
[03:20:43.013 --> 03:20:43.613]  Appreciate him.
[03:20:44.154 --> 03:20:45.214]  Top Trends Forecaster.
[03:20:46.254 --> 03:20:48.575]  I want more reporters to cover Trump in Europe.
[03:20:48.635 --> 03:20:51.136]  I want more reporters to cover all these big events.
[03:20:51.256 --> 03:20:52.916]  Paul Watts has been working for six months straight.
[03:20:52.936 --> 03:20:53.657]  He's on vacation.
[03:20:54.597 --> 03:20:55.477]  His brother's a writer.
[03:20:55.657 --> 03:20:57.698]  But we don't have anybody to cover this right now in England.
[03:20:58.778 --> 03:20:59.419]  I'm not bitching.
[03:20:59.939 --> 03:21:00.659]  I'm not complaining.
[03:21:00.699 --> 03:21:03.300]  I'm just saying we need your financial support.
[03:21:04.667 --> 03:21:05.348]  We're in this together.
[03:21:05.368 --> 03:21:06.270]  We make it really easy.
[03:21:06.290 --> 03:21:11.060]  The Memorial Day week sale will end in less than 24 hours.
[03:21:11.821 --> 03:21:12.883]  And it's 60-40% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:18.701]  Check out the new Space Force shirt that is becoming a bestseller already.
[03:21:18.761 --> 03:21:19.622]  New folks would love it.
[03:21:20.082 --> 03:21:21.242]  Glad my instincts were right on that.
[03:21:21.683 --> 03:21:22.983]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:21:23.423 --> 03:21:27.625]  Getting back to the author of An Invitation to the Great Awakening, QAnon.
[03:21:28.185 --> 03:21:32.007]  Getting back to Roy Davis and taking some quick phone calls here.
[03:21:32.707 --> 03:21:34.228]  Let's go to Betty in Wisconsin.
[03:21:34.288 --> 03:21:35.509]  Betty, you're on the air.
[03:21:35.549 --> 03:21:35.909]  Go ahead.
[03:21:37.549 --> 03:21:43.232]  Alex, longtime listener, and I love you, dear, and I'm thankful for everything that you've been doing.
[03:21:43.432 --> 03:21:43.672]  Thank you.
[03:21:44.108 --> 03:21:56.120]  I understand where you're coming with the Q movement, but I want you to be understood from us, the ones that are followers of yours, but also have got involved in the Q movement, but from a spectacle standpoint.
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:21:59.183]  Because of the information that you've got, it made us dig deeper.
[03:21:59.704 --> 03:22:04.829]  And I need to thank you, because if you wouldn't have been doing what you've been doing for the last 25 years,
[03:22:06.306 --> 03:22:11.050]  Alex, none of us would have been open to this and would have believed that this could happen.
[03:22:11.711 --> 03:22:14.553]  Let's be clear.
[03:22:14.673 --> 03:22:17.035]  I'm all for any other movement bigger than what I'm doing.
[03:22:17.295 --> 03:22:18.056]  I'm great with that.
[03:22:18.636 --> 03:22:22.420]  I just, when some parts of it say something about me that isn't true, that's when I get upset.
[03:22:23.441 --> 03:22:24.261]  Absolutely.
[03:22:24.441 --> 03:22:24.962]  Absolutely.
[03:22:24.982 --> 03:22:26.023]  And I was offended.
[03:22:26.123 --> 03:22:29.205]  And when I heard people, when people make comments to me and I said, well, you know what?
[03:22:29.426 --> 03:22:31.407]  You better check your sources because you ain't right.
[03:22:31.928 --> 03:22:32.848]  That's not Alex Jones.
[03:22:32.909 --> 03:22:33.869]  I've listened to this guy for 25 years.
[03:22:34.938 --> 03:22:42.439]  And I know this guy, excuse me, 20 years I've listened to you, and I know you, and I take all of your products and I give all your products to everybody I know.
[03:22:42.459 --> 03:22:43.319]  Maddie, you're amazing.
[03:22:43.379 --> 03:22:44.000]  You're a sweetheart.
[03:22:44.380 --> 03:22:46.180]  So what's your view on this overall?
[03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:56.382]  What I think is that I think we all need to kind of sit back and wait for all the plan to kind of unfold, because there's a lot of stuff that the Q has proved.
[03:22:56.422 --> 03:22:58.102]  There's so many proofs out there, Alex.
[03:22:58.142 --> 03:22:59.102]  There's tons of them.
[03:22:59.202 --> 03:23:03.623]  But in the same respects, there is also people out there who are spreading the bullcrap.
[03:23:04.232 --> 03:23:05.493]  And you know it as well as I do.
[03:23:05.533 --> 03:23:08.555]  They've done it to you and they've done it to the cue board and they're doing it to all of it.
[03:23:08.595 --> 03:23:15.539]  We also have to understand is that even though there is Patriots looking at the cue board, there also is the enemy looking at the cue board.
[03:23:17.461 --> 03:23:18.741]  Alright, I appreciate your call Betty.
[03:23:18.761 --> 03:23:20.983]  You want to comment on that, Roy?
[03:23:21.547 --> 03:23:21.867]  Betty's 100%.
[03:23:21.947 --> 03:23:23.849]  I couldn't have said any better.
[03:23:24.469 --> 03:23:26.751]  100% and I'll stand by everything she said, really.
[03:23:27.271 --> 03:23:30.974]  You know, there's truth to this, where we go one, we go all.
[03:23:31.054 --> 03:23:35.037]  I mean, it's a part of making America great again, is we all have to chip in.
[03:23:35.057 --> 03:23:39.179]  We all have to recognize we're on the same team and we have to all go forward together.
[03:23:39.199 --> 03:23:41.501]  You know, let's not look back backwards.
[03:23:41.541 --> 03:23:46.845]  I think that's part of the movement, is that we research, we find this information out on our own.
[03:23:47.325 --> 03:23:48.306]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[03:23:48.426 --> 03:23:49.746]  Thanks for taking the call.
[03:23:49.766 --> 03:23:53.348]  First of all, and real quick, I don't know, but you're back on Apple Podcasts.
[03:23:53.388 --> 03:23:54.609]  I don't know if you knew that or not.
[03:23:54.629 --> 03:23:55.289]  War Room, David Knight.
[03:24:14.063 --> 03:24:16.125]  Alex Jones Show, all back on Apple.
[03:24:16.145 --> 03:24:19.828]  Did they reload our millions of subscribers, or is somebody else putting it up there?
[03:24:20.889 --> 03:24:22.150]  Oh no, this is from Apple.
[03:24:22.210 --> 03:24:23.011]  It's your channel.
[03:24:23.631 --> 03:24:24.852]  This is podcast now.
[03:24:24.872 --> 03:24:26.033]  You're not on the App Store.
[03:24:26.133 --> 03:24:28.095]  You're on Apple Podcasts.
[03:24:28.135 --> 03:24:28.835]  Let me ask you this.
[03:24:28.895 --> 03:24:31.638]  Is it our 30-something million subscribers between the shows?
[03:24:32.979 --> 03:24:34.480]  Or did they... Here's what I'm asking.
[03:24:34.500 --> 03:24:36.302]  Did they just re-subscribe you all of a sudden?
[03:24:36.642 --> 03:24:37.523]  Or did you have to go find it?
[03:24:38.504 --> 03:24:38.724]  Yep.
[03:24:38.804 --> 03:24:39.024]  Nope.
[03:24:39.124 --> 03:24:39.985]  They resubscribed me.
[03:24:40.005 --> 03:24:43.126]  I got a notification that there were 42 downloads available.
[03:24:43.146 --> 03:24:43.867]  It's crazy.
[03:24:44.527 --> 03:24:50.931]  Well, because I don't want to say this on air yet, but about a week ago, I noticed some other stuff.
[03:24:51.131 --> 03:24:53.112]  And so, wow, I'm going to have to check.
[03:24:53.192 --> 03:24:55.933]  I mean, it looks like they're starting to capitulate, but we'll see what happens.
[03:24:56.994 --> 03:24:57.174]  Yeah.
[03:24:57.214 --> 03:25:03.197]  But anyways, about this QAnon thing, I thought for a long time that our favorite community organizer may be involved.
[03:25:03.257 --> 03:25:07.079]  And I've seen the divisiveness on Twitter regarding Q people at each other's throats.
[03:25:07.555 --> 03:25:14.156]  Also, we have people like Prang Medic, and as much as I respect this captain you have on, all these people seem to be for profit, right?
[03:25:14.696 --> 03:25:18.677]  There's people who decode these Easter eggs for boomers for money.
[03:25:18.697 --> 03:25:23.658]  If you guys are part of a movement, why does everyone seem to be capitalizing on it?
[03:25:24.418 --> 03:25:28.139]  And it just seems too perfect, right?
[03:25:28.179 --> 03:25:29.739]  And where we go one, we go all.
[03:25:29.779 --> 03:25:34.460]  And if that includes off of a cliff, when all these crazy QAnon people get pinned with
[03:25:35.413 --> 03:25:36.654]  The Pizza Gate Conspiracy.
[03:25:36.674 --> 03:25:37.975]  NBC has already done that.
[03:25:38.035 --> 03:25:43.880]  NBC ABC ran these articles saying that Q folks are pushing wild conspiracy.
[03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:45.401]  It's already been happening.
[03:25:45.942 --> 03:25:46.842]  It's really clear to me.
[03:25:46.903 --> 03:25:47.323]  I don't see...
[03:25:47.887 --> 03:25:51.509]  Why these people follow fan fiction and it's not considered lunacy?
[03:25:51.989 --> 03:25:52.709]  Who is Q?
[03:25:53.890 --> 03:25:54.090]  Right?
[03:25:54.370 --> 03:25:56.712]  Well, that's my issue with anything that's anonymous.
[03:25:56.772 --> 03:25:58.853]  But I get people that have their free speech rights.
[03:25:59.473 --> 03:26:03.695]  Is that once it's anonymous, then the system can do whatever it wants in its name.
[03:26:04.295 --> 03:26:05.416]  And so that's all I'm saying.
[03:26:05.436 --> 03:26:06.316]  Do you have any comments?
[03:26:06.817 --> 03:26:07.317]  Thank you, Brandon.
[03:26:07.737 --> 03:26:11.259]  Do you have any comments, Captain Roy Davis, about that?
[03:26:12.199 --> 03:26:13.841]  Well, the proof will be in the pudding, Alex.
[03:26:13.901 --> 03:26:16.883]  It's just a question of timing.
[03:26:17.444 --> 03:26:20.907]  The deep state's taken a long time to build up, and it's taken a long time to tear down.
[03:26:20.927 --> 03:26:31.597]  And again, I understand the caller being a little suspicious and untrusting of anonymous sources.
[03:26:31.677 --> 03:26:35.701]  But again, a lot of the people that do the YouTubes
[03:26:36.961 --> 03:26:37.742]  I know Praying Medic.
[03:26:37.782 --> 03:26:38.982]  I know Dave.
[03:26:39.142 --> 03:26:41.964]  He's a pretty religious guy and he's pretty straightforward.
[03:26:42.084 --> 03:26:53.189]  He wrote religious books before Q. He was an author before Q. And again, if he's writing a book about Q now, it's hard to say that that's a profiteer fella, because he was already a known writer ahead of time.
[03:26:53.229 --> 03:26:54.409]  He's just changing subjects.
[03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:59.631]  It'd be like Stephen King changing a subject and then trying to condemn him for not staying in the original lane.
[03:27:00.852 --> 03:27:03.233]  Myself, I wasn't an author before I got into this, but I
[03:27:03.693 --> 03:27:08.616]  I've done public speaking and that's one of the reasons I volunteered to be one of the big people to do interviews.
[03:27:08.636 --> 03:27:08.976]  Now I understand.
[03:27:08.996 --> 03:27:09.917]  Let's take another call then.
[03:27:10.217 --> 03:27:10.677]  Real quick.
[03:27:10.717 --> 03:27:11.517]  Sandy in Minnesota.
[03:27:11.557 --> 03:27:12.078]  You're on the air.
[03:27:12.098 --> 03:27:12.638]  Thanks for holding.
[03:27:14.539 --> 03:27:16.460]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:19.042]  I'll try to make this really fast.
[03:27:19.262 --> 03:27:30.148]  First of all, I agree with Brandon 100% because I've been around the Patriot soapbox with pamphlet and all the rest of them and I started out in the beginning of it.
[03:27:30.928 --> 03:27:32.269]  I wouldn't have nothing to do with it.
[03:27:32.976 --> 03:27:35.097]  Uh, they ask for money all the time.
[03:27:35.697 --> 03:27:41.018]  And the difference between you, Alex, and the difference between Q... No, I'm really... I... You know what?
[03:27:41.058 --> 03:27:45.479]  You do the research, all the research and stuff, and all these people research, and they think for themselves.
[03:27:45.679 --> 03:27:46.159]  Wonderful.
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:46.960]  Great idea.
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:54.362]  But, here's the thing, is you have always brought the proof, and the proof is in the pudding, Alex.
[03:27:55.062 --> 03:27:55.582]  All the time.
[03:27:56.385 --> 03:28:00.466]  Now, on the other hand, everything is vague, and you've got to research for yourself.
[03:28:00.986 --> 03:28:21.772]  If this is the almighty Q, then why is it that he has to profit from it, number one, and the people have to profit from it, and I'm not talking about somebody writing a book, or whatever, but then, why is it you have to ask in these chat lines, like Patriot Soapbox, etc., to donate money?
[03:28:23.453 --> 03:28:24.493]  And, second of all,
[03:28:25.450 --> 03:28:27.436]  This big JFK Jr.
[03:28:27.476 --> 03:28:28.258]  conspiracy.
[03:28:28.960 --> 03:28:30.845]  Now, JFK Jr.
[03:28:31.005 --> 03:28:31.667]  is dead.
[03:28:31.988 --> 03:28:33.692]  He is not coming back.
[03:28:35.450 --> 03:28:36.231]  I heard that too.
[03:28:36.271 --> 03:28:38.272]  You know, we've got to end this now because I already took 30 minutes.
[03:28:38.292 --> 03:28:39.553]  Gerald Cilente and I apologize.
[03:28:39.953 --> 03:28:41.274]  Top Trends Forecast are coming up.
[03:28:41.314 --> 03:28:42.855]  We'll do another interview of this gentleman.
[03:28:43.155 --> 03:28:45.516]  We'll come back on, ma'am, and I promise we'll get you back on.
[03:28:45.876 --> 03:28:47.037]  Steve and Frank and others, I'm sorry.
[03:28:47.457 --> 03:28:48.498]  The book, The Great Awakening.
[03:28:49.058 --> 03:28:50.579]  Roy Davis, we appreciate you coming on.
[03:28:51.580 --> 03:28:53.241]  And again, I don't get people selling stuff is fine.
[03:28:53.261 --> 03:28:54.301]  You got to fund your operation.
[03:28:55.102 --> 03:28:57.483]  But I know people were actually paying on chat boards for info.
[03:28:57.503 --> 03:28:58.384]  That's a little weird.
[03:28:58.764 --> 03:28:59.985]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:00.025 --> 03:29:00.485]  Stay with us.
[03:29:17.461 --> 03:29:21.624]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:29:22.424 --> 03:29:32.731]  I was just at a local t-shirt shop six months ago, and I bought a t-shirt that showed the space shuttle blasting off into space.
[03:29:33.892 --> 03:29:38.075]  And I happened to wear that on Joe Rogan's podcast, and people just talked about the shirt everywhere.
[03:29:38.655 --> 03:29:40.877]  All these websites got started selling the shirt.
[03:29:42.182 --> 03:29:43.423]  Because it's a NASA patch.
[03:29:43.863 --> 03:29:45.464]  It's copyright free.
[03:29:45.504 --> 03:29:46.005]  It's government.
[03:29:46.325 --> 03:29:50.088]  But I had it redone where it says Space Force.
[03:29:51.269 --> 03:29:54.531]  And we made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[03:29:54.671 --> 03:29:56.873]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[03:29:57.313 --> 03:30:01.856]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with Infowars.com.
[03:30:01.976 --> 03:30:05.539]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify.
[03:30:05.919 --> 03:30:07.601]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[03:30:07.641 --> 03:30:12.047]  Now, the 18-wheeler, printed, produced, made in America, arrives next Wednesday.
[03:30:12.167 --> 03:30:13.969]  But I'm going to do some fanfare on this shirt.
[03:30:14.190 --> 03:30:16.312]  I believe this is going to be the next Hillary for Prison shirt.
[03:30:17.213 --> 03:30:18.735]  But it's about a pro-human future.
[03:30:19.496 --> 03:30:21.239]  It's about humanity going to the stars.
[03:30:21.879 --> 03:30:23.361]  It's about believing in
[03:30:24.582 --> 03:30:26.583]  The amazing gifts that God's given us.
[03:30:26.643 --> 03:30:27.304]  We're not gods.
[03:30:27.324 --> 03:30:29.245]  We're not going to be gods, but we're made in the image of God.
[03:30:29.285 --> 03:30:30.786]  So we're a reflection.
[03:30:31.226 --> 03:30:32.547]  So we can do some amazing things.
[03:30:32.607 --> 03:30:33.868]  We're master builders.
[03:30:34.008 --> 03:30:39.111]  And the space shuttle's 1930s technology put into function in the late 1970s, retired five years ago.
[03:30:39.291 --> 03:30:40.352]  And so we've redone it.
[03:30:40.512 --> 03:30:46.375]  Also had people on the street love the shirt, but a few have gone, why are you wearing that gay rainbow flag?
[03:30:46.555 --> 03:30:48.496]  And that's when I decided a few months ago to make the shirt.
[03:30:48.576 --> 03:30:52.119]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sick of leftist groups or whoever expropriating
[03:30:52.879 --> 03:30:58.022]  If you're a homosexual and you're not doing legal stuff, I don't care what you do in your bedroom.
[03:30:58.042 --> 03:31:00.684]  That's the left claiming the conservatives are obsessed with what you're doing.
[03:31:00.764 --> 03:31:02.865]  Just leave kids alone with your heterosexual, homosexual.
[03:31:03.065 --> 03:31:05.166]  Plus, it's not a plastic rainbow.
[03:31:05.226 --> 03:31:07.288]  It's supposed to be the atmosphere.
[03:31:07.428 --> 03:31:14.652]  Anybody that knows, that's why NASA created this, below in the atmosphere is more dust and stuff than a spectrometer or in a telescope, it's red.
[03:31:16.485 --> 03:31:17.766]  As you get higher, it's orange.
[03:31:17.826 --> 03:31:24.353]  That's why the sun on the horizon is red, because you're looking through hundreds of miles of atmosphere and a few miles of atmosphere.
[03:31:24.393 --> 03:31:26.455]  So clear sky is black.
[03:31:27.316 --> 03:31:30.338]  Below that is blue, then it's yellow, then it's orange, then it's red.
[03:31:30.399 --> 03:31:32.260]  That's why out of thousands of
[03:31:33.021 --> 03:31:33.942]  Space shuttle patches.
[03:31:33.962 --> 03:31:34.563]  They've got thousands.
[03:31:34.663 --> 03:31:36.404]  It took me days to actually find the original patch.
[03:31:36.424 --> 03:31:38.206]  So this is a copy of the original patch.
[03:31:38.627 --> 03:31:41.710]  We put Space Force on it and established 2020.
[03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:44.052]  American flag on the side.
[03:31:44.312 --> 03:31:45.233]  I designed this shirt.
[03:31:45.714 --> 03:31:46.855]  I'm very proud of this shirt.
[03:31:47.416 --> 03:31:48.597]  And maybe I'm wrong.
[03:31:49.237 --> 03:31:51.540]  But when I think this is Zeitgeist, it tends to be a Zeitgeist.
[03:31:53.069 --> 03:31:56.632]  I've had other shirts, hundreds of thousands of which have been put on the street.
[03:31:56.652 --> 03:31:58.073]  And it's helped fund our operation as well.
[03:31:58.113 --> 03:32:05.558]  But this shirt has such nice fabric, it's made in America, all of it, that it cost us $10 a shirt.
[03:32:06.418 --> 03:32:08.220]  I did a huge order and got it down for $13.
[03:32:10.259 --> 03:32:11.660]  Printing and the quality of the shirt.
[03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:13.761]  We're coming up with a women's version as well.
[03:32:13.801 --> 03:32:14.682]  Women can wear this as well.
[03:32:15.543 --> 03:32:16.543]  I'm very proud of it.
[03:32:16.603 --> 03:32:17.744]  People are going to be like, what is that?
[03:32:18.485 --> 03:32:19.605]  What is Space Force?
[03:32:19.745 --> 03:32:21.647]  So it's kind of an undercover thing too.
[03:32:21.707 --> 03:32:26.450]  It's like you might get hit in the head with a bike lock or stabbed if you're a Trump supporter and you're out there doing something.
[03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:28.051]  And you're wearing a Trump shirt, InfoWars shirt.
[03:32:28.151 --> 03:32:29.192]  People still love those and wear them.
[03:32:29.352 --> 03:32:30.253]  What about a space force?
[03:32:30.393 --> 03:32:36.899]  What about loving technology and what we've built and having a pro-human future in space and the American flag that triggers so many?
[03:32:36.979 --> 03:32:38.620]  LittleinfoWars.com.
[03:32:38.700 --> 03:32:40.722]  I think this is the shirt, so pre-order.
[03:32:40.762 --> 03:32:41.943]  I never do pre-orders on t-shirts.
[03:32:42.063 --> 03:32:42.864]  We'll have it next week.
[03:32:42.944 --> 03:32:45.346]  It'll be shipped out by the end of the week, but get your order first.
[03:32:45.546 --> 03:32:48.168]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:33:06.112 --> 03:33:08.717]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.607 --> 03:33:27.227]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:27.547 --> 03:33:36.649]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilenti.
[03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:42.450]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti.
[03:33:43.290 --> 03:33:44.150]  Great being on.
[03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:46.551]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me on.
[03:33:47.331 --> 03:33:48.211]  It's a real honor.
[03:33:48.571 --> 03:33:53.412]  I'm a supporter of InfoWars, even though sometimes it's not so popular.
[03:33:54.435 --> 03:33:57.817]  Alex always let me say what I want to say, and I say that to everybody.
[03:33:57.897 --> 03:33:59.539]  I go on all different kinds of shows.
[03:33:59.559 --> 03:34:01.540]  I say what I want to say.
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:03.581]  I agree, disagree.
[03:34:04.202 --> 03:34:06.123]  You know me, I don't have any agenda.
[03:34:06.283 --> 03:34:11.887]  Think for yourself is the motto of the Trends Journal, and the latest edition of the Trends Journal just came out.
[03:34:11.927 --> 03:34:16.991]  The only magazine in the world where you will read history before it happens.
[03:34:17.911 --> 03:34:21.794]  And the history we're going to be talking about a little bit right now is the history of the economy.
[03:34:22.987 --> 03:34:28.468]  And as we well know, following the panic of 08, they juiced the markets with that monetary methadone.
[03:34:29.468 --> 03:34:36.670]  Things like they never taught you in graduate school or Economics 101, quantitative easing, zero negative interest rate policy.
[03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:38.770]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:34:39.230 --> 03:34:39.751]  It's real.
[03:34:42.831 --> 03:34:46.452]  One of the ways we forecast trends is we read a lot of stuff.
[03:34:46.832 --> 03:34:51.553]  Financial Times, New York Times, China Today, Al Jazeera,
[03:34:52.421 --> 03:34:59.986]  Ha Ha Nets, Jerusalem Post, Fars News Agency, you name it, we read it, and a load of business publications as well.
[03:35:01.366 --> 03:35:10.312]  So when you just start looking deeper into what's going on, and you can see where things are going, what's going on has nothing to do with the trade war BS, because that's all that is.
[03:35:10.332 --> 03:35:12.753]  It has nothing to do with that at all.
[03:35:13.154 --> 03:35:17.076]  It's the monetary methadone that they shot into the system is finally wearing down.
[03:35:18.001 --> 03:35:26.044]  And all these governments are really, really infected with very heavy doses of debt.
[03:35:27.264 --> 03:35:29.685]  So, here's our forecast.
[03:35:30.405 --> 03:35:37.347]  As you well know, I've been on InfoWars and the media now for, you know, scores of years.
[03:35:39.588 --> 03:35:46.470]  I've been saying gold prices accurately since I call the gold bull run.
[03:35:47.128 --> 03:35:48.749]  Back in early 2000s.
[03:35:49.730 --> 03:35:51.071]  I call the retraction.
[03:35:51.952 --> 03:35:52.932]  I call the bottom.
[03:35:54.113 --> 03:35:57.416]  And now I'm saying gold has bottomed.
[03:35:58.236 --> 03:36:00.158]  It may go down a little bit more.
[03:36:01.338 --> 03:36:03.240]  But it may go up much, much more.
[03:36:04.381 --> 03:36:08.164]  And when I say it may go up much, much more, I'm going to give you the parameters.
[03:36:09.344 --> 03:36:10.906]  Today, gold's up 20 bucks.
[03:36:13.387 --> 03:36:13.968]  That's a lot.
[03:36:14.728 --> 03:36:15.529]  And it's been going up.
[03:36:16.983 --> 03:36:17.303]  Why?
[03:36:17.984 --> 03:36:19.385]  Nothing to do with trade wars.
[03:36:20.225 --> 03:36:22.007]  It has to do with the global slowdown.
[03:36:22.767 --> 03:36:33.695]  And the understanding that the addicts, that people call investors, the gamblers, they need more cheap money.
[03:36:34.655 --> 03:36:37.998]  And the global banks are going to do it, including the United States.
[03:36:39.639 --> 03:36:45.243]  Back in March, I had forecast the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.
[03:36:46.755 --> 03:36:53.616]  And that mortgage rates, back in November when they were around 5%, I said they would go under 4%.
[03:36:53.656 --> 03:36:56.437]  30-year mortgage in the United States.
[03:36:57.417 --> 03:36:57.917]  Guess what?
[03:36:59.577 --> 03:37:00.077]  It just hit $399.
[03:37:00.117 --> 03:37:04.798]  They're going to do everything they can to pump this economy up.
[03:37:05.618 --> 03:37:07.039]  Trump wants to get re-elected.
[03:37:07.819 --> 03:37:09.719]  He knows we need more cheap money in there.
[03:37:10.999 --> 03:37:15.320]  He helped do it with lowering taxes for the corporations, big stock buybacks.
[03:37:16.010 --> 03:37:17.351]  Over a trillion bought back.
[03:37:17.951 --> 03:37:19.011]  That's slowed right now.
[03:37:19.071 --> 03:37:20.472]  Now there's stocks selling.
[03:37:22.212 --> 03:37:24.433]  Gold is the ultimate safe haven asset.
[03:37:25.674 --> 03:37:28.134]  The other safe haven asset is bonds.
[03:37:29.655 --> 03:37:32.316]  And you're seeing a lot of money flowing into bonds.
[03:37:33.516 --> 03:37:36.517]  Even though the yield is way down.
[03:37:36.537 --> 03:37:36.597]  Why?
[03:37:37.658 --> 03:37:40.679]  Because global players want safe haven.
[03:37:43.991 --> 03:37:45.172]  And bonds, U.S.
[03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:46.593]  bonds, are a safe haven.
[03:37:47.314 --> 03:37:48.475]  They're not going to go bust.
[03:37:49.976 --> 03:37:51.218]  They'll just keep printing more money.
[03:37:52.659 --> 03:37:59.985]  So gold prices, my forecast is, the lowest they're going to go is probably around $1,270, $1,260.
[03:38:00.086 --> 03:38:03.889]  They have to break above $1,385 an ounce, $1,385 per ounce, for it to next mark.
[03:38:11.667 --> 03:38:13.568]  And that next mark is $1,450.
[03:38:14.088 --> 03:38:17.109]  I don't give financial advice.
[03:38:17.169 --> 03:38:18.370]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:38:19.250 --> 03:38:20.571]  There's a global slowdown.
[03:38:21.551 --> 03:38:24.393]  China factory slowdown stirs global fears.
[03:38:25.393 --> 03:38:26.474]  Financial Times.
[03:38:27.874 --> 03:38:35.838]  Activity at Chinese factories slowed and a key employment indicator tumbled to a 10-year low in May.
[03:38:36.638 --> 03:38:37.439]  Oh, this is June?
[03:38:37.799 --> 03:38:38.259]  Only May?
[03:38:41.721 --> 03:38:42.822]  Reviving worries.
[03:38:44.122 --> 03:38:44.523]  You ready?
[03:38:45.864 --> 03:38:47.705]  That trade tensions with the U.S.
[03:38:48.185 --> 03:38:52.187]  and troubles in the country's banking sector could weigh on growth.
[03:38:52.708 --> 03:38:54.469]  No, not trade with the U.S.
[03:38:55.329 --> 03:39:05.415]  It's the $40 trillion in debt that the Chinese economy built up to get this thing rolling.
[03:39:06.956 --> 03:39:08.097]  That's what's going on.
[03:39:11.920 --> 03:39:18.843]  So, the Chinese manufacturing index for May fell to 49.4.
[03:39:19.123 --> 03:39:21.784]  Anything below 50 is contraction.
[03:39:29.267 --> 03:39:35.030]  Brazil and Mexico contract as low commodity prices take toll.
[03:39:35.810 --> 03:39:37.831]  Has nothing to do with trade wars.
[03:39:38.624 --> 03:39:42.485]  Low commodity prices because there's more supply than demand.
[03:39:45.705 --> 03:39:46.886]  And what else do we have here?
[03:39:47.106 --> 03:39:53.607]  Mexico peso tumbles 2.5% as investors seek out safety.
[03:39:53.627 --> 03:40:00.048]  And of course, that follows Trump's telling them that, listen, stop these people flowing over our borders.
[03:40:00.068 --> 03:40:02.029]  We're going to put tariffs on you.
[03:40:04.169 --> 03:40:05.609]  What if it was reverse?
[03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:08.170]  What if Americans
[03:40:09.964 --> 03:40:10.585]  Excuse me.
[03:40:12.086 --> 03:40:14.707]  We're flooding into Mexico's borders.
[03:40:17.609 --> 03:40:19.871]  What would the reaction be down in Mexico?
[03:40:20.211 --> 03:40:21.292]  Oh, let's take them in.
[03:40:21.752 --> 03:40:22.713]  Oh, let's take them in.
[03:40:23.033 --> 03:40:24.394]  The more, the merrier.
[03:40:24.954 --> 03:40:25.515]  Oh, yeah.
[03:40:26.135 --> 03:40:27.676]  We're not making much money now.
[03:40:27.756 --> 03:40:29.157]  We need more cheap labor.
[03:40:29.257 --> 03:40:29.837]  Bring them in.
[03:40:31.238 --> 03:40:32.759]  We can't take care of our own.
[03:40:32.839 --> 03:40:33.780]  Bring in some more.
[03:40:34.060 --> 03:40:34.921]  We'll pay for them.
[03:40:35.601 --> 03:40:36.722]  Would that be the reverse?
[03:40:37.563 --> 03:40:37.783]  No.
[03:40:39.958 --> 03:40:41.018]  And what else do we have here?
[03:40:41.319 --> 03:40:41.419]  Ah!
[03:40:42.239 --> 03:40:46.300]  Factory slump hints at troubles ahead.
[03:40:47.761 --> 03:40:48.061]  U.S.
[03:40:48.121 --> 03:40:52.983]  manufacturers are having a hard time mounting an encore to last year's strong performance.
[03:40:53.663 --> 03:40:58.525]  Factories are on track for their weakest showing this year since 2016.
[03:40:58.585 --> 03:41:05.147]  You know what manufacturing accounts for in the United States?
[03:41:06.488 --> 03:41:08.509]  The grand total of 11
[03:41:10.691 --> 03:41:14.373]  11% of our gross domestic product.
[03:41:14.993 --> 03:41:14.373]  11%!
[03:41:16.374 --> 03:41:18.135]  Oh yeah, it's a trade war.
[03:41:18.395 --> 03:41:21.116]  We want everything made in another country.
[03:41:21.516 --> 03:41:23.677]  We don't want to have manufacturing.
[03:41:24.198 --> 03:41:28.680]  We don't want to pay people working wages, living wages.
[03:41:29.240 --> 03:41:35.503]  No, they could be plantation workers on the multinational plantations in Slavelandia.
[03:41:36.083 --> 03:41:37.584]  Get a job at Amazon.
[03:41:38.144 --> 03:41:39.505]  Pick those boxes up.
[03:41:40.473 --> 03:41:41.253]  Ship them out!
[03:41:41.433 --> 03:41:42.034]  Pick them up!
[03:41:42.134 --> 03:41:42.794]  Ship them out!
[03:41:42.894 --> 03:41:43.414]  Pack them!
[03:41:43.594 --> 03:41:44.114]  Pick them up!
[03:41:44.214 --> 03:41:44.775]  Ship them out!
[03:41:44.875 --> 03:41:45.335]  Pack them!
[03:41:46.335 --> 03:41:53.858]  And make, by the time you pay taxes and healthcare and everything else, you're left with $62.50 a week and a hernia.
[03:41:54.618 --> 03:41:56.398]  That's the kind of job you want.
[03:41:59.980 --> 03:42:01.680]  So you can see where this is going.
[03:42:03.901 --> 03:42:07.302]  Expansion slips and spending cools.
[03:42:07.702 --> 03:42:08.643]  Oh, where could that be?
[03:42:09.303 --> 03:42:09.763]  India.
[03:42:12.074 --> 03:42:14.976]  Export weakness weighs on growth.
[03:42:15.396 --> 03:42:16.657]  Oh, where's that coming from?
[03:42:17.437 --> 03:42:18.318]  Canada.
[03:42:19.658 --> 03:42:20.379]  You got it.
[03:42:21.419 --> 03:42:22.580]  I forgot about Turkey.
[03:42:22.620 --> 03:42:24.021]  Hey, how about Argentina?
[03:42:26.542 --> 03:42:27.683]  Wonderful in Italy.
[03:42:27.703 --> 03:42:30.544]  Oh, slowdown in Germany.
[03:42:31.645 --> 03:42:33.246]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:42:35.327 --> 03:42:37.008]  Things are getting tight out there.
[03:42:39.090 --> 03:42:40.751]  You're going to blame it on trade wars.
[03:42:40.811 --> 03:42:41.311]  It's not.
[03:42:41.471 --> 03:42:42.392]  It's bigger than that.
[03:42:43.352 --> 03:42:47.575]  So again, watch your safe haven assets.
[03:42:49.276 --> 03:42:50.457]  It's very important.
[03:42:51.797 --> 03:42:53.999]  Because bad times are coming.
[03:42:54.979 --> 03:42:55.820]  Are you prepared?
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:42:57.521]  Stay tuned.
[03:42:58.481 --> 03:43:02.203]  And we'll give you some more information on what to do, what to think about.
[03:43:03.784 --> 03:43:04.685]  Remember just
[03:43:06.235 --> 03:43:19.598]  Four or five years ago, they would have articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, saying that globalists didn't exist, and that no one wanted global government.
[03:43:19.678 --> 03:43:34.162]  Well, as soon as Hillary lost, they came out and said, okay, global government's real, globalists are real, but they're the good guys, and everyone against globalism is a white supremacist.
[03:43:37.884 --> 03:43:40.045]  You know where globalism came from?
[03:43:43.206 --> 03:43:44.486]  It came from the Nazis.
[03:43:47.447 --> 03:43:54.910]  They wanted a system to counter the British Empire that was the global power at that time.
[03:43:54.930 --> 03:43:59.551]  The old saying was, the sun never set on the British Empire.
[03:44:00.091 --> 03:44:01.712]  And Hitler gave speeches.
[03:44:02.012 --> 03:44:03.352]  Hitler wrote articles.
[03:44:03.412 --> 03:44:04.733]  It was all over the news at the time.
[03:44:06.147 --> 03:44:14.851]  That he wanted a European Union that would then dominate the globe in a form of globalism.
[03:44:15.612 --> 03:44:18.133]  So the term globalism actually comes from the Nazis.
[03:44:18.693 --> 03:44:23.876]  The modern Olympics symbols, the VW, the highways, NASA.
[03:44:24.196 --> 03:44:27.618]  I mean, they definitely innovated some stuff in their power ground.
[03:44:29.568 --> 03:44:32.149]  And I'm not saying this is a German or Nazi conspiracy.
[03:44:32.189 --> 03:44:33.929]  Hell, I'm half German myself.
[03:44:34.049 --> 03:44:34.889]  Germans are great people.
[03:44:35.669 --> 03:44:41.651]  But when harnessed by evil, good people can be like horses drawing the devil's carriage.
[03:44:43.011 --> 03:44:52.493]  And so ideas of the Nazis and ideas of the British Empire competed with each other, and big corporations picked up those ideas, and that's modern globalism.
[03:44:53.877 --> 03:45:00.962]  So InfoWars is seen as the most pure strain of Americana by the globalists.
[03:45:01.782 --> 03:45:11.508]  I've talked to top people in Hollywood, in entertainment, and in media, and in government, and they've said, Jones, you're seen as Americana.
[03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:23.156]  But they say, as beautiful as Americana is, I'm not saying I'm beautiful, but Americana's beautiful, it stands in the way of the larger ideas of the planet and a one world government system.
[03:45:24.639 --> 03:45:31.461]  Well, humans are revolting against that one world government system, and are saying they don't want to be under its hegemonic control.
[03:45:32.181 --> 03:45:36.562]  Their great truth that they're so sure is, for us, isn't for us.
[03:45:37.282 --> 03:45:41.563]  In different countries and parts of the world, we don't want to be under their control.
[03:45:41.603 --> 03:45:43.524]  We don't want to carry out their vision.
[03:45:44.084 --> 03:45:45.184]  We want to live our own lives.
[03:45:46.445 --> 03:45:51.106]  And that's what InfoWars represents, and that's why they've set up a system to demonize us.
[03:45:52.284 --> 03:45:53.825]  They've set up a system to lie about us.
[03:45:54.565 --> 03:45:58.026]  They've set up a system to create this strawman of who we are.
[03:45:58.046 --> 03:46:05.789]  Because they understand that people don't do things for money or power at the end of the day.
[03:46:06.650 --> 03:46:08.390]  They do it because of narratives.
[03:46:08.830 --> 03:46:09.991]  They do it because of culture.
[03:46:10.291 --> 03:46:13.312]  They do it because of ethos and what they stand for.
[03:46:16.033 --> 03:46:20.135]  Oh, some people may sell out for money, but people that really count do it for ideology.
[03:46:21.314 --> 03:46:25.759]  And the system knows that I'm trying to reboot, that you're trying to reboot.
[03:46:27.021 --> 03:46:29.824]  A system that competes with the British Empire.
[03:46:30.085 --> 03:46:32.848]  The British Empire called it the American system 200 years ago.
[03:46:33.088 --> 03:46:36.633]  They said our system of empire will fail in competition with this.
[03:46:36.673 --> 03:46:38.375]  Hitler said the same thing.
[03:46:39.551 --> 03:46:42.472]  The truth is, our system was the best and the greatest because it empowered individuals.
[03:46:43.213 --> 03:46:47.495]  And now it's fighting the very same systems of tyranny today.
[03:46:48.115 --> 03:46:49.516]  Join us at Infowars.com.
[03:46:49.896 --> 03:46:51.016]  Join the human community.
[03:46:51.617 --> 03:46:53.758]  And spread the word against the censorship.
[03:46:53.838 --> 03:46:56.459]  And know, we will prevail as we've done in the past.
[03:46:56.919 --> 03:47:01.181]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[03:47:06.123 --> 03:47:08.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.821 --> 03:47:27.763]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.224 --> 03:47:31.707]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:31.767 --> 03:47:38.052]  Hello there, hello there.
[03:47:38.092 --> 03:47:39.613]  Welcome back, welcome back.
[03:47:40.314 --> 03:47:41.855]  So, here's the deal.
[03:47:42.716 --> 03:47:45.278]  We got a new name for the two political parties.
[03:47:47.880 --> 03:47:51.663]  You got the Bloods and the Crips, of course, which they are, they're murderers and thieves.
[03:47:53.664 --> 03:47:56.366]  And you got the Kratts and the Kins.
[03:47:56.906 --> 03:48:01.849]  That's right, the dumb old Kratts and the repulsive Kins.
[03:48:03.489 --> 03:48:06.671]  Those are the parties running and ruining America.
[03:48:08.032 --> 03:48:12.774]  And it's the presidential reality show, Step Right Up, Step Right Up.
[03:48:13.535 --> 03:48:15.236]  No different than any other country.
[03:48:15.256 --> 03:48:17.337]  You saw it happen over there in Ukraine.
[03:48:18.317 --> 03:48:22.740]  Yeah, they elected a guy that played a comedian on TV.
[03:48:23.831 --> 03:48:32.438]  Well, he is a comedian, and he played on this comedy show that he was president of the Ukraine, and he trounced Poroshenko.
[03:48:33.919 --> 03:48:42.286]  And, of course, we were the first magazines to call Trump a winner back in May of 2016, against all the polls.
[03:48:42.366 --> 03:48:44.188]  It's the presidential reality show.
[03:48:44.948 --> 03:48:46.650]  This cat knows how to play the game.
[03:48:48.731 --> 03:48:51.774]  So, now what's going on in the presidential reality show?
[03:48:54.477 --> 03:48:59.180]  Gillibrand talks guns and abortion in Our Aunt Fox.
[03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:00.201]  Wow, okay.
[03:49:00.842 --> 03:49:02.042]  That's what you talked about, huh?
[03:49:03.203 --> 03:49:03.964]  And then guns.
[03:49:04.544 --> 03:49:07.646]  Red flag gun laws gain bipartisan support.
[03:49:08.847 --> 03:49:13.811]  And that, of course, follows that massacre this past weekend in Virginia Beach.
[03:49:16.152 --> 03:49:17.613]  I'm all in favor of gun laws.
[03:49:18.174 --> 03:49:18.674]  Oh, yeah.
[03:49:19.775 --> 03:49:21.116]  Start with the military.
[03:49:22.537 --> 03:49:23.057]  That's right.
[03:49:23.991 --> 03:49:24.752]  Start with them.
[03:49:25.272 --> 03:49:30.855]  Stop them killing people all over the world, sent there by the politicians.
[03:49:34.457 --> 03:49:38.300]  Let them put down their guns.
[03:49:39.740 --> 03:49:49.186]  Stop invading nations based on lies like, oh, when I was a kid, Vietnam, Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened, and then, of course,
[03:49:49.892 --> 03:49:53.816]  That Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[03:49:55.137 --> 03:50:06.707]  Yeah, and now, of course, one thing after another, whether it's Libya, Syria, still in Afghanistan, let's learn to hate Venezuela.
[03:50:07.228 --> 03:50:15.855]  So when the military puts down their guns and stops taking all my dough to buy them, oh, and then, of course, I forgot the
[03:50:17.338 --> 03:50:18.779]  Militarized police.
[03:50:19.419 --> 03:50:25.663]  Oh, yeah, those guys, you know, with all that sweat jackets on and, you know, breaking into people's houses and... Yeah.
[03:50:27.323 --> 03:50:29.825]  You get rid of their guns, then come and talk to me.
[03:50:32.546 --> 03:50:35.548]  Gun laws will be effective as the war on drugs.
[03:50:37.009 --> 03:50:38.369]  You're not gonna stop it.
[03:50:43.852 --> 03:50:46.754]  Only a very tiny percentage of people with guns
[03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:48.730]  Commit these heinous acts.
[03:50:51.552 --> 03:50:54.814]  There are over 350 million guns out there.
[03:50:55.335 --> 03:50:56.316]  What is this going to do?
[03:50:56.856 --> 03:50:57.176]  Nothing.
[03:50:58.317 --> 03:51:00.138]  Except rob us of more of our rights.
[03:51:00.779 --> 03:51:07.764]  So, going back to the Presidential Reality Show, this Sunday at 5.30 p.m.
[03:51:09.505 --> 03:51:11.727]  Eastern Time, I will be
[03:51:16.556 --> 03:51:22.221]  At the comic strip live in New York on 2nd Avenue.
[03:51:23.922 --> 03:51:29.787]  I was last year the winner of New York's funniest reporter.
[03:51:30.848 --> 03:51:36.573]  And this year I'm going to be back and talking to somebody, you know, doing my bit.
[03:51:36.953 --> 03:51:39.775]  Not going to in the race for the report.
[03:51:39.815 --> 03:51:40.936]  I won that last year.
[03:51:42.881 --> 03:51:58.372]  I'm announcing this for all those cats and kittens in the New York area that want to come to the comic strip, because I am going to make one of the most important announcements of my career.
[03:51:59.152 --> 03:52:02.234]  And you can hear it live at the comic strip.
[03:52:03.495 --> 03:52:05.456]  And you can go online, get the tickets.
[03:52:05.977 --> 03:52:08.799]  And by the way, the money goes to the Humane Society.
[03:52:09.739 --> 03:52:12.181]  So it's a good cause, and of course,
[03:52:13.217 --> 03:52:17.698]  I'm going to make an announcement that's going to hit like a rocket.
[03:52:19.419 --> 03:52:24.060]  It's going to be felt from top to bottom around the world.
[03:52:24.881 --> 03:52:33.443]  So if you want to hear it, be there this Sunday at the Comic Strip on 2nd Avenue in New York.
[03:52:34.584 --> 03:52:37.004]  So, moving on to some other trends over here.
[03:52:39.145 --> 03:52:42.166]  Danish center-left woos voters with
[03:52:44.480 --> 03:52:45.821]  I know this will come as a shock.
[03:52:47.142 --> 03:52:49.564]  Tough migrant line.
[03:52:50.805 --> 03:52:58.591]  They don't want any more people, foreigners, coming in and losing their national heritage.
[03:52:59.332 --> 03:53:00.593]  And I've been to Denmark.
[03:53:01.694 --> 03:53:02.954]  Lovely, lovely place.
[03:53:03.095 --> 03:53:07.018]  Lovely, lovely time and had some fine food.
[03:53:10.280 --> 03:53:12.382]  Remember, this is
[03:53:13.191 --> 03:53:17.074]  A so-called progressive country, not a populist nation.
[03:53:19.815 --> 03:53:27.240]  Germany's ruling coalition under strain after SPD leader steps down.
[03:53:28.401 --> 03:53:42.791]  There's changes going on all over the world, except in the U.S.S.A., where we're still stuck with the dumb old crats and the repulsive kins
[03:53:43.646 --> 03:53:46.067]  that are running and ruining our lives.
[03:53:47.228 --> 03:53:58.835]  Germany's Social Democrats who plunged deeper into crisis yesterday after the party's leader quit, raising fresh questions over the durability of Angela Merkel's ruling coalition.
[03:54:00.396 --> 03:54:04.798]  One of the issues there, of course, are also immigration.
[03:54:06.119 --> 03:54:07.620]  But what no one talks about is
[03:54:08.706 --> 03:54:16.768]  I don't understand why all these Syrian refugees are in Greece and in Germany and in France.
[03:54:17.968 --> 03:54:18.928]  Why are they leaving?
[03:54:19.008 --> 03:54:20.208]  I can't figure it out.
[03:54:20.228 --> 03:54:22.689]  The Iraqis and the Afghanistans.
[03:54:23.909 --> 03:54:32.671]  And why would they want to leave their war-torn countries that keep getting bombed and destroyed?
[03:54:32.691 --> 03:54:37.732]  Thanks to the USA.
[03:54:38.891 --> 03:54:42.394]  Launching these unwarranted wars based on lies.
[03:54:43.194 --> 03:54:44.135]  Afghanistan.
[03:54:44.875 --> 03:54:48.178]  We gotta get that guy Osama Bin Laden.
[03:54:48.218 --> 03:54:49.719]  He's been hiding there.
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:51.781]  Yeah, great, huh?
[03:54:54.302 --> 03:54:57.025]  Longest war in American history with no end in sight.
[03:54:57.725 --> 03:54:58.586]  I'll give you the end.
[03:54:59.666 --> 03:55:01.188]  The end is going to come next year, 2020.
[03:55:03.649 --> 03:55:08.373]  Trump is going to announce the end of that war as he runs for the presidency.
[03:55:11.050 --> 03:55:14.733]  Story in today's eternal paper of record, the New York Times.
[03:55:16.095 --> 03:55:18.076]  Pause in Korean War Games.
[03:55:19.798 --> 03:55:20.058]  Yep.
[03:55:20.719 --> 03:55:38.014]  Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Sunday that he did not see a need to restore the large-scale joint military exercises that the United States and South Korea suspended the past year as a concession to North Korea.
[03:55:38.609 --> 03:55:41.171]  These exercises, these war games, are a joke.
[03:55:41.211 --> 03:55:42.252]  It's a waste of money.
[03:55:43.313 --> 03:55:44.894]  Trump's very smart in ending it.
[03:55:44.914 --> 03:55:49.778]  There's going to be peace with North Korea before the elections as well.
[03:55:53.782 --> 03:56:05.972]  The future of this society to go higher is with peace, and that's why I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:56:06.963 --> 03:56:16.788]  What's different than this crazy person going in and killing all those innocent people as he did last week?
[03:56:18.088 --> 03:56:22.991]  Tell me the difference of some crazy person that's called president.
[03:56:23.851 --> 03:56:26.012]  You know, I don't like that guy Assad.
[03:56:26.152 --> 03:56:31.935]  I say he has to go and I'll kill anybody that gets in their way for me to stop it.
[03:56:32.675 --> 03:56:36.037]  As the Americans and their coalition of the killing have done,
[03:56:36.730 --> 03:56:40.613]  In Syria with over 600,000 Syrians dead.
[03:56:41.214 --> 03:56:43.035]  Over a million Iraqis dead.
[03:56:43.416 --> 03:56:46.078]  You know, I don't like that guy Saddam Hussein.
[03:56:46.518 --> 03:56:48.440]  Oh, the next mushroom cloud, you see?
[03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:50.181]  Ooh, yeah, remember that one?
[03:56:50.241 --> 03:56:51.462]  Condoleezza Rice.
[03:56:54.164 --> 03:56:55.265]  Penis Cheney.
[03:56:55.425 --> 03:56:56.606]  I can't say dick.
[03:56:56.687 --> 03:56:57.887]  I don't want to be censored.
[03:56:59.209 --> 03:57:00.690]  What's different than them?
[03:57:02.097 --> 03:57:04.298]  I don't like that guy Qaddafi.
[03:57:04.338 --> 03:57:05.358]  He gotta go.
[03:57:05.518 --> 03:57:09.119]  I'm the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize President, Barack Obama.
[03:57:11.299 --> 03:57:14.760]  I'll kill anybody and destroy the entire nation to get rid of him.
[03:57:15.441 --> 03:57:24.563]  What's different from those sociopaths and psychopaths to the crazy person that just blew away all those innocent people?
[03:57:25.919 --> 03:57:27.180]  Oh, how about that war in Yemen?
[03:57:27.200 --> 03:57:28.241]  Forgot about that one.
[03:57:28.481 --> 03:57:32.744]  That the United States is spending, giving the armaments to kill the people.
[03:57:33.885 --> 03:57:45.534]  So, Occupy Peace, OccupyPeace.com, and don't forget, Comic Strip, this Sunday, in New York, for a major, major announcement.
[03:57:46.214 --> 03:57:47.135]  Thanks for having me.
[03:57:47.155 --> 03:57:49.016]  I'll be back next week.
[03:57:49.777 --> 03:57:50.297]  See you soon.
[03:57:56.072 --> 03:57:57.052]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[03:57:57.112 --> 03:57:59.213]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[03:57:59.253 --> 03:57:59.833]  What's your view?
[03:57:59.853 --> 03:58:00.493]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:58:00.553 --> 03:58:01.673]  I appreciate you having me on.
[03:58:01.713 --> 03:58:03.493]  First off, I wanted to thank you for Bonnie.
[03:58:03.513 --> 03:58:14.815]  You've been using it for a while, but I sent the bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[03:58:14.835 --> 03:58:15.776]  She was ecstatic.
[03:58:15.816 --> 03:58:22.437]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[03:58:22.617 --> 03:58:23.097]  Tumor-y.
[03:58:24.053 --> 03:58:26.815]  Curry in India is powerful.
[03:58:26.855 --> 03:58:29.116]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[03:58:29.196 --> 03:58:29.537]  Ours is 95%.
[03:58:29.577 --> 03:58:32.578]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[03:58:33.179 --> 03:58:35.841]  So, Advil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[03:58:36.221 --> 03:58:39.623]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[03:58:40.203 --> 03:58:42.124]  So that's why Bodies is so incredible.
[03:58:42.164 --> 03:58:44.486]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.
[03:58:44.506 --> 03:58:47.928]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because Bodies is amazing.
[03:58:48.028 --> 03:58:48.809]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:58:53.806 --> 03:58:59.489]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and we're defeating a leftist tyrant!
