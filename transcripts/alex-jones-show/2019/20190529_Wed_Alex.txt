[00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:30.369]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show here on this Wednesday, May 29th, 2019.
[00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.674]  Filling in for Alex, I am Owen Schroer.
[00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:49.866]  Big shoes to fill today on the heels of the Mueller statement that was just given on the Hill.
[00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:57.070]  Now we're going to air the entire thing in the next segment.
[00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.293]  Or maybe we'll do it in the second segment.
[00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:00.514]  Or the third segment.
[00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:02.957]  But we're gonna air the whole thing.
[00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:04.760]  Probably in the next segment.
[00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:09.650]  In fact, I'm just wargaming it all on our air right now.
[00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.032]  We're going to do it in the next segment because I do believe we have more time in that segment than the third segment.
[00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:17.533]  And if I'm right, crew, just give me a note on that.
[00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:19.734]  I think it fits in better in the next segment.
[00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:21.615]  So that's what we're going to do.
[00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:23.936]  And we may air it a couple times.
[00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:28.297]  And I'll maybe do some live commentary over it the first time.
[00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:31.979]  Maybe we'll just air it fully through and then I can come back and do some commentary.
[00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.660]  And then we can take your calls later on.
[00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:37.588]  As we are guest-free today.
[00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:43.770]  But... I have stacks of news to get to.
[00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:54.313]  Much of it is very important culture news and political news, but... They are about to re-drum up Russian collusion.
[00:01:58.434 --> 00:01:59.775]  What else do you need to say?
[00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.235]  They're really about to drum this back up.
[00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:03.696]  That's what this is.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.221]  And it's really stunning.
[00:02:08.842 --> 00:02:13.325]  It's really stunning that we've come full circle now, and we're right back to where we began.
[00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:16.127]  With Russian collusion.
[00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:19.549]  Something that has been totally disproven.
[00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:33.139]  And at this point, if you really believe that Donald Trump colluded with Russia, for, I mean, whatever that means,
[00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.012]  In the mythical world these people live in.
[00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:42.735]  You really have lost all ability to think for yourself.
[00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:49.538]  That's what it really comes down to.
[00:02:49.818 --> 00:03:03.545]  If you really think that Donald Trump was part of a big conspiracy with Putin or Russia or anyone from Russia or some other big conspiracy involving Russia,
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:14.824]  In order to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, if you really believe that, you have lost the ability to think for yourself.
[00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:29.071]  You are under MKUltra mind control, with the television flicker rate putting you in a trance, and then CIA agents, part of some
[00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:37.194]  Modern-day Operation Mockingbird on TV telling you what to think.
[00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:42.098]  This is not a game.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.141]  This is the real world.
[00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:55.591]  And when I realize that that's what's going on, and it just hits you like a rush,
[00:03:57.577 --> 00:04:07.685]  And I'm looking to get this phone call on air today, but as soon as Bob Mueller finished giving his statement, a Democrat called into C-SPAN.
[00:04:09.307 --> 00:04:19.676]  And if it's not the epitome of where the Democrat voter is right now intellectually, well I'd hope it's not, but sadly I think it is.
[00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:24.780]  And it can be so easily
[00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:37.433]  Reverse-engineered to show them how they reached that point in the thought process even though none of it's real.
[00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:40.754]  But yeah, folks.
[00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.695]  They were testing with the flicker rates of the TVs.
[00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:47.337]  They have CIA agents acting like newsmen on television.
[00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:49.658]  This all came out in the Frank Church hearings.
[00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:51.539]  It's clearly still going on.
[00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.560]  I can't believe it, but I'm actually witnessing it.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.781]  We're going to air the full Mueller statement on the other side of this break.
[00:04:58.821 --> 00:04:59.862]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.573]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[00:05:07.053 --> 00:05:09.335]  That what God gave us through Mother Nature is incredible.
[00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:12.096]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:13.617]  And the globalists are so upset.
[00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:17.240]  The problem is, people forget to take them.
[00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:23.139]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:24.380]  So we looked at that.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.101]  We made the very best a.m.
[00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.521]  and p.m.
[00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:34.746]  packets out there with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules that you take in two servings a day that are game-changing a.m.
[00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:35.547]  and p.m.

[00:06:11.317 --> 00:06:16.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Mueller has just given a statement on his report.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.861]  We air it right now on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:25.263]  Everyone, and thank you for being here.
[00:06:27.164 --> 00:06:35.348]  Two years ago, the acting Attorney General asked me to serve as Special Counsel, and he created the Special Counsel's Office.
[00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.510]  The appointment order directed the office to investigate
[00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:43.260]  And remember, this would have happened while Obama was president.
[00:07:09.773 --> 00:07:19.600]  We are formally closing the special counsel's office, and as well, I'm resigning from the Department of Justice to return to private life.
[00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.563]  I'll make a few remarks about the results of our work.
[00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:31.127]  But beyond these few remarks, it is important that the office's written work speak for itself.
[00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.711]  Let me begin where the appointment order begins.
[00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:40.943]  And that is interference in the 2016 presidential election.
[00:07:42.384 --> 00:07:52.389]  As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers, who were part of the Russian military, launched a concerted attack on our political system.
[00:07:53.590 --> 00:08:01.634]  The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign.
[00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:12.118]  They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks.
[00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:19.941]  The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.
[00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.641]  He has not questioned Julian Assange.
[00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:30.505]  And at the same time, as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation
[00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:37.568]  Where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election.
[00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:39.088]  Yeah, that was an anti-Trump.
[00:08:39.108 --> 00:08:47.070]  These indictments contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or the innocence of any specific defendant.
[00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.431]  Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
[00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:53.711]  Unless your name is Donald Trump.
[00:08:53.731 --> 00:09:00.752]  The indictments allege and the other activities in our report describe efforts to interfere in our political system
[00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:03.966]  They needed to be investigated and understood.
[00:09:03.986 --> 00:09:09.092]  That is among the reasons why the Department of Justice established our office.
[00:09:10.954 --> 00:09:15.359]  That is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation.
[00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:16.559]  Mm-hmm.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.601]  The matters we investigated were of paramount importance.
[00:09:19.922 --> 00:09:20.162]  Yes.
[00:09:20.662 --> 00:09:25.986]  It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned.
[00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:27.087]  Illegal votes happen every day.
[00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:40.075]  When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the government's effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.
[00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:43.998]  Let me say a word about the report.
[00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:50.870]  The report has two parts, addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate.
[00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:58.319]  The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election.
[00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:03.566]  This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity,
[00:10:04.648 --> 00:10:10.251]  As well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.
[00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.952]  Literally nothing but the Trump Tower meeting.
[00:10:12.192 --> 00:10:19.436]  And in the second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation.
[00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.338]  So he was told to launch an obstruction of justice investigation.
[00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:22.998]  Very revealing.
[00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:30.522]  The order appointing me special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation.
[00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:39.069]  We conducted that investigation and we kept the Office of the Acting Attorney General apprised of the progress of our work.
[00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:49.771]  And as set forth in the report, after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.
[00:10:51.132 --> 00:10:55.433]  We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the President did commit a crime.
[00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:59.794]  The introduction to the Volume 2 of our report explains
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.640]  That decision.
[00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:11.763]  It explains that under long-standing department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office.
[00:11:12.783 --> 00:11:14.063]  That is unconstitutional.
[00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:20.785]  Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited.
[00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:29.867]  The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy.
[00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:32.232]  So here he is giving the media their narrative.
[00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:34.753]  He would have charged Trump if it was legal.
[00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:06.328]  Because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available.
[00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:13.414]  Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now.
[00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:26.085]  And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.
[00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.111]  Why is he saying all this?
[00:12:30.171 --> 00:12:34.374]  He's giving the media the narrative to run with, and we would have charged Trump if it was legal.
[00:12:34.394 --> 00:12:38.796]  There's no reason at all for him to be going through this, other than to stab Donald Trump in the back.
[00:12:48.697 --> 00:13:00.241]  Those were the principles under which we operated, and from them we concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the President committed a crime.
[00:13:01.522 --> 00:13:10.325]  That is the office's final position, and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the President.
[00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:14.447]  We conducted an independent criminal investigation.
[00:13:15.484 --> 00:13:20.848]  And reported the results to the Attorney General, as required by department regulations.
[00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:22.790]  So now it was a criminal investigation.
[00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:28.435]  The Attorney General then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and to the American people.
[00:13:29.956 --> 00:13:33.699]  At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released.
[00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:42.266]  The Attorney General preferred to make the entire report public all at once, and we appreciate
[00:13:42.844 --> 00:13:50.229]  That the Attorney General made the report largely public, and I certainly do not question the Attorney General's good faith in that decision.
[00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:56.013]  Now I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner.
[00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:59.996]  I am making that decision myself.
[00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:06.341]  No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.
[00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.324]  There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress.
[00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:14.960]  Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report.
[00:14:16.701 --> 00:14:21.723]  It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made.
[00:14:22.844 --> 00:14:26.145]  We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.
[00:14:27.606 --> 00:14:29.567]  And the report is my testimony.
[00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:36.370]  I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.
[00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:45.929]  In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office.
[00:14:47.810 --> 00:15:00.997]  So beyond what I've said here today and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress.
[00:15:01.858 --> 00:15:04.839]  And it's for that reason I will not be taking questions today as well.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.020]  Forever.
[00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:20.880]  Now before I step away, I want to thank the attorneys, the FBI agents, the analysts, the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.363]  These individuals who spent nearly two years with the special counsel's office were of the highest integrity.
[00:15:30.144 --> 00:15:35.627]  And I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments, that there were multiple.
[00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:40.231]  Systematic efforts to interfere in our election.
[00:15:41.332 --> 00:15:45.615]  And that allegation deserves the attention of every American.
[00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:46.556]  Thank you.
[00:15:46.576 --> 00:15:47.597]  Thank you for being here today.
[00:15:48.938 --> 00:15:50.239]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.224]  $50 million, two years of investigations, and that's what you get.
[00:15:56.844 --> 00:15:57.425]  Right there.
[00:15:58.645 --> 00:15:59.046]  Nothing.
[00:15:59.186 --> 00:15:59.706]  Hi.
[00:16:00.587 --> 00:16:05.191]  Okay, it's true.
[00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.766]  And hit the finish oil.
[00:17:12.722 --> 00:17:20.150]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.891]  Changed my life.
[00:17:20.951 --> 00:17:23.414]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:25.156]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:32.824]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on it.
[00:17:34.344 --> 00:17:39.486]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:17:39.506 --> 00:17:45.548]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[00:17:45.608 --> 00:17:53.611]  You want to order it again, but PQQ, CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:55.951]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:59.312]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[00:17:59.873 --> 00:18:00.513]  What'd you think of the X2?
[00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:02.234]  I love that, too.
[00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:06.697]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[00:18:06.737 --> 00:18:15.203]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but you feel like you want to get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't find the word to say.
[00:18:15.343 --> 00:18:18.465]  And I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[00:18:18.485 --> 00:18:21.267]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[00:18:21.287 --> 00:18:22.007]  It's electrochemical.
[00:18:22.027 --> 00:18:22.788]  You're absolutely right.
[00:18:22.848 --> 00:18:26.550]  When I forget to take X2 every couple days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.192]  Then I feel it and I take it and it really is amazing.
[00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:30.413]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.382]  The Animated Contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[00:18:51.122 --> 00:18:53.763]  But you've got to take it in your hands.
[00:18:53.903 --> 00:18:55.584]  You've got to have the will.
[00:18:58.018 --> 00:19:01.465]  Accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[00:19:02.747 --> 00:19:07.036]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:10.042]  This is the Info War.
[00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:18.108]  We believe that they can obtain something if they can destroy the planet before we go to launch fish.
[00:19:18.268 --> 00:19:24.277]  They are just an intergalactic demonic transmission spewed out of hell trying to bring the planet down before the next level.
[00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:26.700]  But we will make the jump and nothing's going to stop it.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.943]  And we're going to have a pro-human future.
[00:19:29.023 --> 00:19:30.165]  We're not just going interstellar.
[00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:31.226]  We're going interdimensional.
[00:19:31.406 --> 00:19:35.210]  As we travel up this true stairway to heaven, people won't want to play video games anymore.
[00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.012]  They'll realize this is the real universe with the real levels.
[00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:39.934]  This is where you want to get that score.
[00:19:40.094 --> 00:19:42.496]  Not in Super Mario Brother, not in Donkey Kong.
[00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:48.942]  I'm Alex Jones, transmitting from the third dimension, planet Earth, two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm, Milky Way Galaxy.
[00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:12.284]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.393 --> 00:20:23.254]  You found it.
[00:20:23.614 --> 00:20:25.116]  The tip of the spear.
[00:20:25.656 --> 00:20:30.480]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:37.471]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you just heard the full Mueller statement.
[00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:48.538]  And I'm gonna do my best to try to just break down everything we just witnessed and what is going to follow because of it.
[00:20:52.741 --> 00:20:59.686]  But at the same time, I have to at least remember it's all a big distraction.
[00:21:01.786 --> 00:21:07.891]  Now having said that, we have to cover the open treason that happened against this country.
[00:21:10.093 --> 00:21:15.297]  Whether you want to say Bob Mueller was involved or not, I guess you could still debate.
[00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:18.820]  But is he covering up for it?
[00:21:20.302 --> 00:21:20.902]  Absolutely.
[00:21:24.905 --> 00:21:28.889]  But how do you even respond to something so fake?
[00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:33.258]  So obviously contrived.
[00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:42.004]  And then, with even the most basic logic and reasoning, can be totally dissembled.
[00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:52.532]  Let's just review some of the things Mueller is saying.
[00:21:54.493 --> 00:21:58.136]  Russia is interfering in our elections.
[00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:12.309]  With cyber attacks and different forms of electric attacks or whatever they're alleging.
[00:22:12.429 --> 00:22:14.190]  Maybe that's happening, maybe that's not happening.
[00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.970]  That's not what they were investigating.
[00:22:17.091 --> 00:22:25.253]  You have Obama on a hot mic talking about meeting with Putin once he gets re-elected.
[00:22:28.294 --> 00:22:30.715]  So, I mean, it's just a joke.
[00:22:31.604 --> 00:22:38.668]  To act like you can't talk to Russians, to act like you're not allowed to meet with Russian ambassadors.
[00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:41.349]  But that's what they're doing.
[00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:57.137]  And so, why does an entire body of people believe that Donald Trump colluded with Russia even though there's no evidence?
[00:22:57.257 --> 00:23:00.539]  Because the media has been telling them that.
[00:23:05.598 --> 00:23:22.992]  And Bob Mueller could have come out here and made a statement saying, we found nothing, we investigated for two years, the media hyped something up that we never had, the origins of this investigation are being investigated and could have been fraudulent, but he didn't do any of that, did he?
[00:23:24.793 --> 00:23:29.037]  He went on with the giant myth that Trump colluded with Russia.
[00:23:31.021 --> 00:23:31.761]  And that what else?
[00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:34.462]  WikiLeaks was a part of it.
[00:23:35.002 --> 00:23:36.402]  So let's think about that.
[00:23:39.743 --> 00:23:46.305]  Julian Assange is currently under arrest and has been charged with what?
[00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:49.886]  18 different Espionage Act violations or some such thing?
[00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:51.246]  By the U.S.
[00:23:51.266 --> 00:23:51.546]  government?
[00:23:52.507 --> 00:23:54.427]  And that's Trump's bag man?
[00:23:55.327 --> 00:23:56.828]  In the Russian collusion?
[00:23:57.728 --> 00:23:58.128]  Delusion?
[00:24:01.597 --> 00:24:08.123]  If Donald Trump is colluding with Russia, why would he have to go through WikiLeaks as a conduit?
[00:24:09.984 --> 00:24:10.725]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:24:14.768 --> 00:24:29.121]  And if WikiLeaks was indeed the conduit as Bob Mueller claims it to be, how come Julian Assange has never been questioned to this day, and there's been no evidence presented
[00:24:29.895 --> 00:24:41.603]  That Wikileaks had any involvement with Russia in regards to the Clinton email hack, which is just one of the email dumps done by Wikileaks.
[00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:47.427]  Now, there's a couple other ripples in this that are going to be interesting.
[00:24:49.369 --> 00:24:50.730]  Obviously, Mueller's done speaking.
[00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.171]  He's not going to speak in front of Congress.
[00:24:53.192 --> 00:24:54.953]  This is going to anger the left.
[00:24:57.133 --> 00:24:58.513]  This is going to really anger the left.
[00:24:58.533 --> 00:25:01.454]  They're expecting Mueller to testify before Congress.
[00:25:02.415 --> 00:25:03.595]  They need that testimony.
[00:25:04.095 --> 00:25:05.076]  They're not going to get it.
[00:25:07.637 --> 00:25:14.279]  And that's because they don't realize how devastating that would be to the Russian collusion narrative.
[00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.160]  If Mueller is sat before Congress, Republicans are going to get to question him too.
[00:25:19.681 --> 00:25:20.721]  And it's not going to be pretty.
[00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:28.474]  But Mueller realizes that, so he's not going to testify before Congress.
[00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:40.902]  But then there's the media, which has been the real issue here, as far as the deception is concerned, with the public.
[00:25:42.263 --> 00:25:43.264]  Well, you heard Mueller.
[00:25:43.384 --> 00:25:49.748]  He said that they couldn't prove there was no obstruction, but they also couldn't prove there was obstruction.
[00:25:50.842 --> 00:26:05.246]  So, that's Mueller basically signaling to Democrats in intel communities and intelligence house committees and signaling to the media to say, Trump may have committed a crime, we just couldn't find it.
[00:26:06.606 --> 00:26:14.128]  Or, Trump did commit a crime, but we couldn't get the evidence and we couldn't charge him anyway if we did.
[00:26:16.226 --> 00:26:26.108]  So that means that all the Democrats in the House committees and the Senate committees are about to launch all a bunch of separate investigations into Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:26:27.229 --> 00:26:41.872]  And the media is going to start spouting the narrative that Trump would have been found guilty if the laws weren't constructed to protect the President from such charges.
[00:26:43.237 --> 00:26:45.538]  But let's recall all the lies.
[00:26:45.818 --> 00:26:49.600]  They said President Trump was not under criminal investigation.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.300]  It turns out he was.
[00:26:53.621 --> 00:26:56.583]  It turns out they were even investigating him for obstruction of justice.
[00:26:56.683 --> 00:27:00.144]  How could they do such a thing when they have not even found a crime?
[00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:04.586]  How can you obstruct justice when no crime exists?
[00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:20.220]  How can you say Trump didn't cooperate when there was more cooperation from the Trump administration and Trump associates in this investigation than the Mueller team even expected?
[00:27:25.424 --> 00:27:26.865]  But what does it really all come down to?
[00:27:28.427 --> 00:27:35.312]  And this is where... This is where the paradox exists.
[00:27:37.134 --> 00:27:38.455]  It all comes down to the fact
[00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:55.427]  That Obama illegally spied on the Trump campaign and they needed an excuse so that they could not be charged criminally for treason.
[00:27:57.048 --> 00:28:06.594]  And the claim that Trump colluded with Russia was the cover for the illegal spying by the Obama administration.
[00:28:09.386 --> 00:28:20.691]  Now, that's very surface level, above the fold, above the horizon, above the water that we can see.
[00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:31.496]  But there's so much else going on behind the scenes beyond that, that it's really impossible to break down in one segment.
[00:28:32.897 --> 00:28:35.678]  But that's Mueller's statement.
[00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.372]  And that's what I expect to come from this.
[00:28:39.432 --> 00:28:42.274]  So Democrats are going to launch a bunch of investigations.
[00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:44.156]  Drum them up.
[00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:49.400]  The media is going to drum it up saying that Trump would have been charged if the laws weren't constructed the way they were.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.321]  Mueller will be deemed a hero.
[00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:55.625]  That is until he refuses to testify in front of Congress.
[00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:58.627]  And then the average leftist will be angry at him.
[00:28:58.747 --> 00:28:59.228]  And who knows?
[00:28:59.348 --> 00:29:00.649]  Maybe even CNN will be too.
[00:29:03.078 --> 00:29:10.865]  I scream and it's like Google goes, I'm wearing a pink and a green sock and I got a little beard and I talk like this.
[00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:12.447]  You know what those guys do when they get on jets?
[00:29:12.687 --> 00:29:17.512]  They go, bring me 15 hookers now and get the drugs ready and take me to private island.
[00:29:19.173 --> 00:29:20.474]  Get the satanic rituals ready.
[00:29:23.077 --> 00:29:25.079]  You don't just think the enemy has sleeper cells, do you?
[00:29:31.172 --> 00:29:36.554]  They've told me directly, if I don't want to be sued, if I don't want to be attacked, if I don't want to be, you name it, stop reporting on this.
[00:29:36.854 --> 00:29:39.714]  And guess what I'm going to say to the big bank and the Newark Federal Reserve and everybody else?
[00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:40.935]  Here's what I have to say to them.
[00:29:41.315 --> 00:29:41.755]  Hey, you ready?
[00:29:41.775 --> 00:29:43.495]  This is what I'm saying to you right now.
[00:29:44.076 --> 00:29:44.896]  You got that message?
[00:29:45.576 --> 00:29:46.256]  Never going to stop.
[00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:47.137]  Never going to stop.
[00:29:47.157 --> 00:29:47.957]  Going to beat you too.
[00:29:50.257 --> 00:29:51.038]  We're in a fight here.
[00:29:51.058 --> 00:29:53.538]  I got like two battle axes fighting them.
[00:29:53.578 --> 00:29:54.479]  They're hacking at me.
[00:29:54.499 --> 00:29:55.419]  We're like, ah!
[00:29:57.339 --> 00:29:59.280]  But you don't want to come out of mommy's basement.
[00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:06.613]  You want to sit there and suck on your own little wee-wee and play video games and pretend like you're this big, you know, badass person.
[00:30:06.813 --> 00:30:08.774]  You're a soldier on the internet battling everybody.
[00:30:08.794 --> 00:30:12.756]  A lot of liberals have broken their conditioning because of it.
[00:30:12.776 --> 00:30:13.836]  Just keep making fun of me!
[00:30:14.016 --> 00:30:14.676]  Keep attacking!
[00:30:14.736 --> 00:30:15.356]  I love it!
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:16.557]  I'm totally destroying you!
[00:30:23.199 --> 00:30:23.940]  So under U.S.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.141]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B... Is that true?
[00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:28.902]  You nailed that right there?
[00:30:28.942 --> 00:30:29.422]  Yes, yes.
[00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:36.424]  Oh man, you wanna fight, you're gonna get one.
[00:30:36.885 --> 00:30:40.713]  I don't wanna lose my voice, I just want you to know.
[00:30:46.715 --> 00:30:51.736]  The majority of the frogs, uh, in most areas in the United States are now gay.
[00:30:54.676 --> 00:30:56.017]  But it's like a rape fable.
[00:30:56.537 --> 00:30:59.097]  You know, it looks all nice and candy, puppy.
[00:30:59.117 --> 00:31:00.597]  That's how they act all liberal.
[00:31:00.917 --> 00:31:02.718]  Oh my gosh, communism's really good.
[00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:03.618]  You're gonna like it.
[00:31:03.638 --> 00:31:04.438]  Get in the car.
[00:31:04.458 --> 00:31:07.659]  Oh, you like that?
[00:31:07.719 --> 00:31:08.219]  Wonder Man.
[00:31:09.459 --> 00:31:10.359]  Oh yeah, you like that?
[00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:11.419]  We'll see it again?
[00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:12.999]  Oh yeah?
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:14.580]  Woo!
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.060]  Yeah, that's Goblin Power.

[00:33:40.946 --> 00:33:49.911]  We have the clip I was looking for, the crew found it, of the caller right after the Mueller statement was given on C-SPAN.
[00:33:49.951 --> 00:34:05.400]  And I just want to play it because, again, I mean, I don't even know really how to properly break this down other than to just apply what I know, what we all know, and what we're seeing.
[00:34:07.202 --> 00:34:21.718]  We know that the CIA and other government programs and other governments have tested with flicker rates on televisions and lights on monkeys and probably even humans.
[00:34:21.738 --> 00:34:27.465]  I don't know if that's declassified, but let's not act like we're not still in Kansas here.
[00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:35.792]  And you know that the CIA embeds operatives in the media.
[00:34:35.852 --> 00:34:37.352]  This came out in the Frank Church hearings.
[00:34:37.432 --> 00:34:39.853]  This came out in the declassified JFK file.
[00:34:39.893 --> 00:34:43.014]  So, when you combine those two things, what can you do?
[00:34:43.074 --> 00:34:58.599]  You can run a massive... You can run a massive false flag, a massive false narrative, a massive fake news story, and create mass hysteria.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.162]  And that's what they've done with the Russian investigation in the Mueller report.
[00:35:04.182 --> 00:35:10.745]  But I'm going to play the clip that really encapsulates that here in just a minute.
[00:35:10.765 --> 00:35:15.127]  But first, I haven't even paid the bills yet here today.

[00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:23.627]  It's basically huge.
[00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:27.808]  Imagine you're walking into a big, giant department store, basically.

[00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:52.527]  Alright, I want to go to this clip now that just encapsulates how brainwashed and deceived the average Democrat voter is.
[00:37:53.007 --> 00:37:58.909]  Listen to this C-SPAN caller in immediate response to the Mueller statement today.
[00:37:59.878 --> 00:38:01.141]  Justice and we'll get to those.
[00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:07.076]  We'd love to hear from you and we'll go first to our Democrats line to hear from Diana Livingston, New Jersey.
[00:38:07.256 --> 00:38:08.098]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.150]  Hi, good morning.
[00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:19.552]  I hope that now that Mueller has formally resigned from the Department of Justice, that he will be allowed to testify publicly.
[00:38:19.892 --> 00:38:21.173]  Pause it right there.
[00:38:21.613 --> 00:38:22.533]  Deception number one.
[00:38:23.293 --> 00:38:26.274]  She says that he will be allowed to testify.
[00:38:26.754 --> 00:38:29.555]  No one's stopping him from testifying but him.
[00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:30.455]  But you watch.
[00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.395]  This is the Democrat delusion.
[00:38:32.756 --> 00:38:42.818]  They're going to be under the auspices that Trump or the Attorney General or somebody somehow is stopping Mueller from testifying even though he's the one stopping it.
[00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:44.759]  He's the one that doesn't want to testify.
[00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:51.521]  So the Democrats are going to be ticked off that Mueller's not going to testify in front of Congress even though that's his choice.
[00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:54.122]  So there's deception number one.
[00:38:54.562 --> 00:38:55.022]  Roll the tape.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:04.304]  There are election security, which this Trump administration and GOP Congress has failed to pass any bill... Pause it right there!
[00:39:05.225 --> 00:39:06.485]  Election security.
[00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:11.828]  Lady, there are people pouring over the southern border like you won't believe.
[00:39:12.148 --> 00:39:12.749]  And guess what?
[00:39:13.209 --> 00:39:14.409]  They're getting on the voter rolls.
[00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:19.352]  Dead people are voting, people are voting twice, people are voting in counties they haven't lived in in decades.
[00:39:19.772 --> 00:39:21.193]  What do you think's going on?
[00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.272]  And you're gonna complain about election security?
[00:39:25.453 --> 00:39:28.015]  Heck, they even come out and say non-citizens should vote now!
[00:39:30.538 --> 00:39:33.821]  And you're gonna act like election security is the problem?
[00:39:34.162 --> 00:39:35.783]  Oh, but what's the big twist to this?
[00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:41.389]  The Trump administration is doing nothing about the Russians interfering in our election!
[00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:46.034]  This happened during the Obama administration.
[00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:49.467]  It didn't happen during the Trump administration.
[00:39:49.747 --> 00:39:51.668]  In fact, you can go back and look.
[00:39:52.348 --> 00:39:56.129]  Obama discounted the threats of Russia.
[00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.470]  It was a national news story.
[00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.931]  Obama doesn't take the threat of Russian interference seriously.
[00:40:05.851 --> 00:40:07.692]  Obama says nobody can hack the elections.
[00:40:08.956 --> 00:40:11.659]  So it was the Obama administration that allowed all this to happen.
[00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:14.321]  It was the Obama administration that stood down, lady!
[00:40:15.002 --> 00:40:15.782]  And what do they do?
[00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:16.823]  They blame Trump.
[00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:20.447]  Just like it's gonna be Mueller that won't testify, they'll blame Trump.
[00:40:20.827 --> 00:40:25.832]  Just like it was Obama's administration that allowed the Russian interferes to happen, they'll blame Trump.
[00:40:26.813 --> 00:40:27.213]  Okay?
[00:40:27.233 --> 00:40:32.217]  I mean, again, I can reverse engineer and show how delusional these people are all day.
[00:40:33.339 --> 00:40:34.580]  But let's go back to her.
[00:40:36.263 --> 00:40:38.023]  Just listen to the delusion in this lady's voice.
[00:40:38.263 --> 00:40:41.084]  She has no idea what she's talking about.
[00:41:05.822 --> 00:41:09.084]  Again, everything she's complaining about happened during the Obama years.
[00:41:09.704 --> 00:41:13.946]  Donald Trump and his administration cooperated to the fullest extent!
[00:41:14.747 --> 00:41:15.907]  Millions of dollars were spent!
[00:41:16.368 --> 00:41:17.648]  And they lied to him about the whole thing!
[00:41:17.748 --> 00:41:18.509]  Alright, go back to the caller.
[00:41:19.915 --> 00:41:19.995]  I'm
[00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:36.765]  It's all Hillary!
[00:41:36.865 --> 00:41:38.426]  It's literally all Hillary!
[00:41:38.706 --> 00:41:39.286]  So there it is, folks.
[00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:08.841]  Fumbling and stammering and bumbling around, totally clueless.
[00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:11.222]  Blaming Trump for the things that Obama allowed.
[00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.563]  Blaming Trump for Mueller's decisions.
[00:42:15.244 --> 00:42:19.506]  When Mueller even said, stated clearly, it's my decision not to testify before Congress.
[00:42:19.726 --> 00:42:21.467]  It's my decision not to speak publicly after this.
[00:42:21.667 --> 00:42:23.228]  He said it himself!
[00:42:23.628 --> 00:42:29.891]  And these delusional people call in and say, Mueller better testify or Trump's stopping him from doing it.
[00:42:32.932 --> 00:42:33.713]  You know, look.
[00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:40.561]  I mean, how do you even live in this clown world anymore?
[00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:44.463]  I just don't even believe it.
[00:42:44.503 --> 00:42:48.905]  And Democrat voters honestly think we're stupid.
[00:42:49.725 --> 00:42:51.406]  They really think we're stupid.
[00:42:52.507 --> 00:42:59.170]  As they are getting drug around like a bull by its horns, like by the ring of its nose right now.
[00:42:59.231 --> 00:42:59.851]  It's unbelievable.
[00:43:27.185 --> 00:43:28.766]  Trump, Putin, Russian collusion.
[00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.307]  Trump, Russian sort of collusion.
[00:43:30.387 --> 00:43:31.908]  Trump, Russian possible collusion.
[00:43:31.948 --> 00:43:33.669]  Trump, Russian metal collusion.
[00:43:33.689 --> 00:43:35.130]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.751]  Trump, Russian deadly collusion.
[00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:38.332]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:43:38.372 --> 00:43:39.893]  Trump, Russian possible collusion.
[00:43:39.913 --> 00:43:41.493]  Trump, Russian blood collusion.
[00:43:41.534 --> 00:43:43.094]  Trump, Russia, Russian collusion.
[00:43:43.134 --> 00:43:44.695]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.216]  Russia hacked our election.
[00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:47.857]  Here comes a big change.
[00:43:48.618 --> 00:43:52.220]  Because all of a sudden, Trump, Russian, possible collusion.
[00:43:54.641 --> 00:43:56.582]  Was there collusion?
[00:43:56.863 --> 00:43:57.943]  Absolutely.
[00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:14.046]  Russia, possible collusion.
[00:44:14.426 --> 00:44:16.447]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:44:16.647 --> 00:44:18.048]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:19.749]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:21.250]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.051]  Trump, Russia, potential collusion.
[00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:24.472]  Trump, Russia, possible collusion.
[00:44:24.512 --> 00:44:34.297]  Putin and the Kremlin can be in collusion with Putin and the Kremlin can be in collusion with Putin and the Kremlin can be in collusion with Putin
[00:44:34.517 --> 00:44:35.158]  We're good.
[00:44:50.814 --> 00:44:53.436]  All 17 intelligence agencies.
[00:44:53.456 --> 00:44:54.497]  17 agencies.
[00:44:54.517 --> 00:44:56.999]  17 of our intelligence agencies have been burned.
[00:44:57.019 --> 00:44:58.580]  17 of our intelligence agencies.
[00:44:58.601 --> 00:44:59.902]  17 intelligence agencies.
[00:44:59.922 --> 00:45:02.704]  17 different United States intelligence agencies.
[00:45:02.764 --> 00:45:03.765]  All 17 of them.
[00:45:03.825 --> 00:45:07.028]  It was called, No Collusion, No Obstruction.
[00:45:12.785 --> 00:45:15.227]  Hillary has Russia ties that are admitted.
[00:45:15.567 --> 00:45:18.569]  Even in the New York Times, Hillary's Russia problem.
[00:45:19.569 --> 00:45:22.111]  30 plus million to get over a third of our uranium.
[00:45:22.711 --> 00:45:24.473]  Making gas deals to sell us out.
[00:45:24.793 --> 00:45:26.954]  She's the one selling out our industry.
[00:45:27.234 --> 00:45:28.555]  Selling out our infrastructure.
[00:45:29.016 --> 00:45:30.957]  Selling out critical minerals.
[00:45:31.257 --> 00:45:32.338]  Critical components.
[00:45:32.918 --> 00:45:35.239]  Hillary is in bed with their companies.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.582]  Hillary is in bed with their weapons producers for the uranium, all of it.
[00:45:39.962 --> 00:45:41.203]  She's caught red-handed.
[00:45:41.423 --> 00:45:43.044]  The Podestas, all of them.
[00:45:44.665 --> 00:45:46.806]  Selling us out seven ways to Sunday.
[00:45:47.206 --> 00:45:58.893]  Obama kills the Russia investigation during the campaign because he knows it leads to the Podesta brothers and Hillary and himself and George Soros because they've all been screwing each other over and selling the country out.
[00:45:58.973 --> 00:46:01.475]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:46:05.504 --> 00:46:07.045]  We are in a complete war!
[00:46:07.145 --> 00:46:10.067]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic, you fools!
[00:46:10.747 --> 00:46:13.509]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:15.531]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:46:16.511 --> 00:46:24.176]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[00:46:24.196 --> 00:46:27.879]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[00:46:28.739 --> 00:46:32.042]  Please do the right thing and stand up against big time!
[00:46:32.462 --> 00:46:35.044]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:46:35.565 --> 00:46:39.608]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:41.369]  I want them shut down.
[00:46:41.669 --> 00:46:45.332]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[00:46:45.652 --> 00:46:49.295]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:50.696]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:46:50.977 --> 00:46:51.917]  I'm a bad person!
[00:46:51.977 --> 00:46:52.638]  I question things!
[00:46:52.698 --> 00:46:53.238]  I'm evil!
[00:46:53.358 --> 00:46:53.699]  I don't...
[00:46:58.407 --> 00:47:00.147]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:47:06.529 --> 00:47:10.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.651 --> 00:47:22.132]  Here we go!
[00:47:27.498 --> 00:47:29.579]  These people are so predictable, man.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:39.745]  Every Democrat is already tweeting, Bob Mueller has just referred us to impeach the president.
[00:47:41.866 --> 00:47:42.386]  Wow.
[00:47:42.866 --> 00:47:45.207]  You people are so damn predictable.
[00:47:45.528 --> 00:47:46.448]  For what?!
[00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.110]  For what?!
[00:47:53.032 --> 00:47:53.272]  You know,
[00:47:56.483 --> 00:48:05.188]  I have hours of videotape of me going to impeach Trump rallies and asking every single individual there why Trump should be impeached and I can't get one answer.
[00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:10.732]  I couldn't even get an answer from the Democrats tweeting this out today.
[00:48:13.774 --> 00:48:16.916]  Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris both just tweeted out it's time to impeach the President.
[00:48:19.037 --> 00:48:20.998]  So I'm sure they're all tweeting it now.
[00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:23.320]  The media is probably all over it too.
[00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:25.493]  For what?
[00:48:25.953 --> 00:48:27.274]  Muller said nothing.
[00:48:27.974 --> 00:48:28.315]  Nothing?
[00:48:29.435 --> 00:48:30.296]  He found nothing?
[00:48:32.277 --> 00:48:36.760]  Again, you know... I'm gonna open up the phone lines here to get your response.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.584]  You know... Because... I don't know.
[00:48:42.924 --> 00:48:46.247]  I feel like I'm fumbling and bumbling around here because this is just insane.
[00:48:47.628 --> 00:48:50.850]  I just can't believe that we're dealing with this level of delusion.
[00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:54.092]  And this level of deception.
[00:48:57.406 --> 00:49:03.592]  And you know, the President better go after these people.
[00:49:05.254 --> 00:49:06.355]  This is just out of control.
[00:49:08.477 --> 00:49:11.199]  This is just out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:13.141 --> 00:49:16.044]  A total, made-up hoax.
[00:49:17.586 --> 00:49:17.886]  Hoax.
[00:49:21.509 --> 00:49:22.130]  In every angle.
[00:49:24.397 --> 00:49:32.142]  And then you could even sit back and hold a mirror to the whole thing and realize that everything they're claiming Trump did, Hillary Clinton actually did and tenfold.
[00:49:34.444 --> 00:49:37.386]  How did they get that information on Trump?
[00:49:37.646 --> 00:49:38.707]  Hillary Clinton paid for it.
[00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:47.433]  The only person that's been caught colluding with any Russians is Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:53.858 --> 00:49:54.158]  I just...
[00:49:55.836 --> 00:49:56.576]  I'm just stunned.
[00:49:58.697 --> 00:49:58.997]  Stunned.
[00:50:00.657 --> 00:50:11.980]  That anybody can be following this and not see the clear levels of deception that the Democrats are engaged in right now.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.061]  I mean, wow.
[00:50:21.382 --> 00:50:21.842]  I'm stunned.
[00:50:23.643 --> 00:50:25.483]  And they buy all of it.
[00:50:27.671 --> 00:50:28.712]  They're never gonna give it up.
[00:50:32.275 --> 00:50:33.316]  I just don't know what you do.
[00:50:34.897 --> 00:50:38.120]  What do you do for someone that's that brainwashed?
[00:50:39.821 --> 00:50:41.683]  What do you do with someone that's that deceived?
[00:50:48.809 --> 00:50:49.770]  I'm taking it back right now.
[00:50:52.657 --> 00:50:55.618]  I am honestly taken aback at the level of deception we're dealing with here.
[00:50:55.678 --> 00:51:00.140]  And this is honestly low-level crap, but that's why it's so frustrating.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:09.223]  Because this is like the most low IQ level of deception, like, you know, slapstick comedy or something, like a poop joke.
[00:51:10.303 --> 00:51:12.544]  And people are falling for it.
[00:51:13.715 --> 00:51:19.839]  Like, I can understand, like, high-level deception, 9-11, Golf of Tonkin, JFK assassination.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.240]  Go down the list.
[00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:26.144]  This is, like, poop joke level IQ deception.
[00:51:27.745 --> 00:51:28.886]  And it's all right in front of us.
[00:51:29.506 --> 00:51:29.867]  All of it.
[00:51:31.368 --> 00:51:31.728]  But you know what?
[00:51:31.748 --> 00:51:35.291]  Go back to that clip, because you want to know why?
[00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:39.474]  Just look at the people in the background of that image.
[00:51:40.703 --> 00:51:41.683]  You can just tell.
[00:51:41.703 --> 00:51:44.964]  The brainwaves are flatlining.
[00:51:44.984 --> 00:51:54.546]  And they're just dragging us down into the depths of society with them.
[00:51:57.867 --> 00:52:04.348]  It's just unbelievable that people can be so deceived by the most low-level deception I've ever seen in my life.
[00:52:07.532 --> 00:52:08.333]  Alright, you know what?
[00:52:09.033 --> 00:52:11.334]  I bet they can't even believe it at this point.
[00:52:13.115 --> 00:52:18.679]  I bet they can't even believe people still can't see their blatant deception.
[00:52:18.779 --> 00:52:20.460]  It's not even difficult to see.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.181]  Alright, I'm just going to open up the phone lines.
[00:52:24.902 --> 00:52:25.923]  Let's get your take on this.
[00:52:27.373 --> 00:52:31.034]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[00:52:31.054 --> 00:52:32.175]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:40.598]  By the way, I'm Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones today on this important broadcast, and I'm just stunned right now.
[00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:48.201]  And I've got all kinds of other news that's very important that I need to get to, but I'm just, like, knocked off my feet.
[00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:53.431]  At the level of delusion.
[00:52:53.591 --> 00:52:54.612]  In fact, I want to go back.
[00:52:54.632 --> 00:52:57.615]  Can we go back to that phone call one more time before we go to callers, guys?
[00:52:57.835 --> 00:52:58.676]  Do we have that queued up?
[00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:03.641]  Yeah.
[00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:06.404]  I want the audience to hear this one more time.
[00:53:08.826 --> 00:53:12.189]  This is the level of deception that we're dealing with in this country.
[00:53:12.249 --> 00:53:12.510]  And again,
[00:53:13.999 --> 00:53:17.402]  I can only apply what we know is going on.
[00:53:18.162 --> 00:53:21.245]  The CIA embeds people in the media.
[00:53:21.505 --> 00:53:23.006]  That came out during the church hearings.
[00:53:23.226 --> 00:53:25.788]  That came out of the declassified JFK files.
[00:53:27.229 --> 00:53:36.877]  Governments test with light patterns and flicker rates and everything on monkeys to see what flicker rates make humans the most susceptible.
[00:53:37.377 --> 00:53:39.278]  You combine those two, what do you get?
[00:53:40.219 --> 00:53:40.800]  An entire
[00:53:41.995 --> 00:54:07.512]  So, even after two years of an investigation and no collusion found, millions of dollars spent, basically a public proctology exam of the President, just unbelievable, and they get nothing, and they tell you they still have something while they give you nothing, and then look and listen to the average Democrat voter, this is a call into C-SPAN, again, I play this
[00:54:08.899 --> 00:54:11.720]  Because I want to take callers here and let's notice the difference.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:22.984]  But just again, I am stunned that people can be so deceived by such low IQ deception like a poop joke from a comedian.
[00:54:23.944 --> 00:54:33.568]  But listen to this Democrat caller in a C-SPAN right after the Mueller statement and see how lost and gone and brainwashed these people are.
[00:54:35.849 --> 00:54:41.747]  We'd love to hear from you, and we'll go first to our Democrats' line to hear from Diana Livingston, New Jersey.
[00:54:41.907 --> 00:54:42.750]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:54:47.114 --> 00:54:48.055]  Hi, good morning.
[00:54:48.836 --> 00:54:57.485]  I hope that now that Mueller has formally resigned from the Department of Justice, that he will be allowed to testify publicly.
[00:54:57.885 --> 00:54:58.786]  Now pause it again.
[00:54:58.806 --> 00:54:59.687]  I'm just trying to break it down.
[00:54:59.707 --> 00:55:02.309]  Again, it's like they don't even listen to their own people.
[00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.091]  She didn't even listen to what Mueller said.
[00:55:04.391 --> 00:55:07.535]  Mueller literally said, he already said, lady, you didn't even listen!
[00:55:08.632 --> 00:55:09.832]  You didn't even listen!
[00:55:09.872 --> 00:55:10.593]  Maybe that's what it is.
[00:55:10.793 --> 00:55:11.513]  They don't want to listen.
[00:55:11.693 --> 00:55:12.933]  They already have their minds decided.
[00:55:13.293 --> 00:55:14.074]  You didn't even listen.
[00:55:14.334 --> 00:55:18.155]  Mueller said in his statement he's not testifying.
[00:55:18.335 --> 00:55:20.395]  He said he's not commenting further.
[00:55:20.695 --> 00:55:21.776]  You didn't even listen!
[00:55:23.476 --> 00:55:24.376]  They never listen!
[00:55:25.817 --> 00:55:26.237]  Go back!
[00:55:29.416 --> 00:55:41.007]  All of this happened during the Obama administration.
[00:55:41.288 --> 00:55:42.769]  It was brought to Obama's desk.
[00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:44.211]  It was brought to his attention.
[00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:45.212]  He chose to do nothing!
[00:55:45.352 --> 00:55:46.293]  That was national news!
[00:55:46.493 --> 00:55:47.194]  New York Times!
[00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:48.215]  Washington Post!
[00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:53.532]  So again, you're projecting everything Obama did onto Trump!
[00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:55.433]  You have been deceived, lady!
[00:55:56.213 --> 00:56:01.474]  You are a victim of CIA MKUltra Mind Control!
[00:56:01.494 --> 00:56:05.175]  We want to free you from the MKUltra Mind Control!
[00:56:05.435 --> 00:56:06.595]  Do you understand?
[00:56:06.936 --> 00:56:08.676]  We are throwing you a life vest!
[00:56:08.876 --> 00:56:10.436]  We are throwing you a tube!
[00:56:10.777 --> 00:56:12.037]  Come back to reality!
[00:56:12.757 --> 00:56:15.098]  Shake the shackles of the MKUltra Mind Control!
[00:56:15.918 --> 00:56:16.358]  Go back!
[00:56:18.015 --> 00:56:21.697]  ...directives to our intelligence agencies to protect our elections.
[00:56:22.117 --> 00:56:24.758]  That's a main concern of our, of me.
[00:56:24.838 --> 00:56:25.578]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:56:25.798 --> 00:56:26.819]  That's a main concern.
[00:56:26.839 --> 00:56:28.680]  Yes, with all the illegal votes coming in, I'm sure.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.680]  ...dismiss this whole thing as a big hoax.
[00:56:31.101 --> 00:56:33.221]  And they mean not the hoax of Russia.
[00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:35.442]  Like, they're trying to admit that, yes, Russia... Russia's a hoax.
[00:56:35.482 --> 00:56:36.003]  It doesn't even exist.
[00:56:36.043 --> 00:56:41.185]  ...interfered, but that the Trump administration had nothing to do with it or weren't eager to accept help.
[00:56:41.825 --> 00:56:50.127]  Here, pause it right here, pause it right here and rewind it 15 seconds.
[00:56:50.147 --> 00:56:54.588]  Now look, we broke down the insanity of this lady, but just listen to the final 60 seconds.
[00:56:54.869 --> 00:56:56.769]  This is the state of a Democrat mind right now.
[00:56:57.089 --> 00:56:58.990]  This is the state of a Democrat voter's mind.
[00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:04.131]  Listen to the just nothings, the ramblings, just like a drunken fool.
[00:57:05.632 --> 00:57:11.378]  It was they interfered, but that the Trump administration had nothing to do with it or weren't eager to accept help.
[00:57:11.939 --> 00:57:20.949]  And even though it wasn't, you know, and this needs to be explained to the people, the difference between a criminal prosecution and immoral action.
[00:57:21.089 --> 00:57:25.951]  You want to know what an MKUltra mind control victim sounds like, folks?
[00:57:25.971 --> 00:57:26.651]  You just heard it, right there.
[00:58:02.435 --> 00:58:06.697]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:58:06.797 --> 00:58:07.598]  They are technocrats.
[00:58:07.858 --> 00:58:09.979]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:58:10.579 --> 00:58:17.463]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:18.363 --> 00:58:19.844]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:20.224 --> 00:58:22.366]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:29.110]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:30.031]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:58:30.511 --> 00:58:31.432]  I work a lot of hours.
[00:58:31.992 --> 00:58:36.976]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:58:37.616 --> 00:58:46.622]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:58:47.603 --> 00:58:53.286]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:53.386 --> 00:58:57.048]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[00:58:57.308 --> 00:59:00.850]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:02.731]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[00:59:03.391 --> 00:59:05.733]  This is the next level.
[00:59:05.793 --> 00:59:06.914]  This is Ultra 12.
[00:59:07.334 --> 00:59:13.239]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:13.479 --> 00:59:16.261]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[00:59:16.602 --> 00:59:17.242]  It tastes great.
[00:59:17.603 --> 00:59:18.924]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[00:59:19.224 --> 00:59:19.924]  It is amazing.
[00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:27.851]  Experience pure Methocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[00:59:28.291 --> 00:59:33.913]  At Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:34.113 --> 00:59:43.056]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're going to find anywhere, and it funds the Infowar, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[00:59:43.296 --> 00:59:46.697]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[00:59:55.123 --> 00:59:59.246]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.088]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.911 --> 01:00:12.797]  Alright, the phone lines are lighting up right now.
[01:00:12.837 --> 01:00:15.019]  We're gonna take your calls coming up shortly.
[01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.283]  There is other news to get to.
[01:00:22.705 --> 01:00:23.085]  I'm just...
[01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:36.582]  I'm saddened that my fellow humans, my fellow Americans, can't see a clear deception campaign going on right in front of their face.
[01:00:36.983 --> 01:00:40.966]  And they just eat it like a fish bites a fake worm on a lure.
[01:00:42.687 --> 01:00:45.529]  Just to get sucked up onto the deck and flop around.
[01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.832]  An intellectual suffocation.
[01:00:48.852 --> 01:00:53.276]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:53.296 --> 01:00:54.877]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex today.
[01:00:56.311 --> 01:01:01.132]  Democrats are already calling for the impeachment of the President after Mueller's statement.
[01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:08.594]  So the Democrats for 2020 are campaigning on two issues now.
[01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:11.734]  One issue, Orange Man Bad.
[01:01:12.394 --> 01:01:13.675]  Second issue, Abort the Babies.
[01:01:15.355 --> 01:01:18.996]  So... Real strong.
[01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:20.576]  Real strong.
[01:01:23.427 --> 01:01:26.809]  campaign agenda for the Democrats in 2020.
[01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.091]  Orange man bad, abort the babies.
[01:01:33.914 --> 01:01:35.756]  I guess maybe throw in higher taxes?
[01:01:35.936 --> 01:01:37.297]  I guess they like higher taxes too.
[01:01:40.659 --> 01:01:52.848]  So, just to highlight what we've been over before we take your phone calls here, Mueller comes out in a short statement, intenuates WikiLeaks, Trump,
[01:01:53.806 --> 01:02:00.552]  And Russia are working together to hack Hillary Clinton and interfere in US elections.
[01:02:00.793 --> 01:02:01.934]  They offer zero proof.
[01:02:02.134 --> 01:02:04.856]  They never interviewed or questioned Assange.
[01:02:06.198 --> 01:02:07.198]  They offer no evidence.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:19.550]  Then goes on to insinuate that if the law wasn't constructed in such a way, they would have charged Donald Trump, President Trump with a crime, but they couldn't.
[01:02:22.478 --> 01:02:35.729]  And Democrats are now, across the board, once again calling for impeachment in what has clearly been a contrived deception of the American people.
[01:02:41.714 --> 01:02:44.176]  So, they're going to try to impeach the President for what?
[01:02:45.817 --> 01:02:46.218]  They don't know.
[01:02:49.941 --> 01:02:50.361]  None of them know.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:03.948]  But the CIA, Mockingbird Press, and the Democrat Party said it's a good thing, so therefore it is.
[01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:12.495]  Total mind control is what it is.
[01:03:13.716 --> 01:03:16.658]  But they're about to have a rude awakening.
[01:03:24.002 --> 01:03:33.129]  You know, if things go the way that they have for my entire life in this Congress, in this government, there'll never be any justice.
[01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:39.333]  We'll never see the light of day about the origins of the illegal spying or anything else.
[01:03:40.214 --> 01:03:49.621]  But if Trump is the real deal, and he actually wants to be the President of the United States, and he actually wants to do something for this country, and he actually wants to drain the swamp, it'll all come out.
[01:03:50.081 --> 01:03:52.143]  And hopefully, maybe then, the deception
[01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.117]  The lines of deception can begin to reveal themselves.
[01:03:57.278 --> 01:04:01.720]  But until that day, it's clear, that's not going to be the case.
[01:04:04.301 --> 01:04:12.004]  But they're gonna be in for a rude awakening, even of their own accord, because they still think Mueller is going to testify before Congress.
[01:04:12.264 --> 01:04:13.285]  He's already said he's not.
[01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:17.707]  So how's that gonna go?
[01:04:20.276 --> 01:04:24.761]  So we're going to take your calls on the other side of this break to discuss all of it.
[01:04:26.804 --> 01:04:28.065]  I do have other news to get to.
[01:04:28.225 --> 01:04:32.490]  I'm just stunned at the level of deception I'm seeing.
[01:04:33.952 --> 01:04:38.437]  And it's just amazing because the Democrat, the average Democrat voter,
[01:04:39.795 --> 01:04:41.396]  It's like nothing goes in.
[01:04:43.056 --> 01:04:45.137]  I don't understand how they can be this deceived at this point.
[01:04:45.538 --> 01:04:46.138]  I really don't.
[01:04:46.278 --> 01:04:50.200]  Whether you like Trump or not, you could still hate Trump with all your guts.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.461]  There's no damn Russian collusion.
[01:04:54.662 --> 01:04:55.982]  But you just have to cling on to that.
[01:04:56.002 --> 01:05:00.204]  You just have to cling on to it because that's the programming.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:06.422]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[01:05:06.883 --> 01:05:09.185]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[01:05:09.485 --> 01:05:13.469]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world, and the globalists are so upset.
[01:05:14.249 --> 01:05:17.072]  The problem is, people forget to take them.
[01:05:18.442 --> 01:05:18.822]  That's right.
[01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:42.152]  PowerStack at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:42.452 --> 01:05:43.673]  Folks, check it out.

[01:06:14.386 --> 01:06:15.787]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:16.047 --> 01:06:17.187]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:17.747 --> 01:06:19.168]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:22.769]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:33.052 --> 01:06:34.313]  Nothing like InfoWars.
[01:06:36.174 --> 01:06:38.174]  Nothing like InfoWars.
[01:06:38.614 --> 01:06:39.935]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:40.035 --> 01:06:41.615]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:06:41.635 --> 01:06:42.936]  We're about to take your calls here.
[01:06:44.016 --> 01:06:50.808]  In response to Mueller's statement and everything that's followed in the short time afterwards, but it's been quite explosive.
[01:06:52.771 --> 01:06:55.896]  Before we do that though, you know, I actually need...
[01:06:57.836 --> 01:07:02.739]  I actually need to go to InfoWarsTore.com because I'm running out of some of my favorite supplements right now.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.721]  So I may have to place an order here live on air.
[01:07:06.462 --> 01:07:08.643]  But I gotta get myself some XtendoWise.
[01:07:09.524 --> 01:07:16.108]  I've run out of XtendoWise and I've run out of BioPCA, both from InfoWarsTore.com, both on sale.
[01:07:16.348 --> 01:07:18.249]  In fact, XtendoWise is 60% off.
[01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.331]  Here's the amazing thing about XtendoWise.
[01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:26.198]  There's all different kinds of oil supplements out there.
[01:07:26.238 --> 01:07:27.319]  We've got great ones.
[01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:28.320]  We've got the krill oil.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.221]  We've got the fish oil.
[01:07:29.241 --> 01:07:30.442]  I have both in my pantry.
[01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:41.493]  I even actually have the kids honor roll with just the DHA because there are different health benefits to just DHA and not the EPA.
[01:07:41.513 --> 01:07:42.294]  I think it's the other one.
[01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:44.296]  The two oils that come in that.
[01:07:45.325 --> 01:07:49.850]  But the ExtendoWise has the fish oil, the CoQ10, and the garlic.
[01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:57.497]  And there have been a lot of studies done on garlic with the positive effects on the immune system and other such things.
[01:07:57.537 --> 01:08:06.106]  So, the ExtendoWise is just an incredible fish oil supplement with CoQ10 and garlic that has so many different benefits.
[01:08:06.366 --> 01:08:07.527]  It's 60% off.
[01:08:07.808 --> 01:08:09.069]  We could barely even talk about this.
[01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:11.469]  I love this product.
[01:08:11.489 --> 01:08:12.270]  I take it every morning.
[01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:14.090]  In fact, I used to do fish oils in the morning.
[01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:16.971]  Now I just do the ExtendoWise, and then I do the fish oils at night.
[01:08:18.312 --> 01:08:23.534]  But we don't even really promote some of our best products, like ExtendoWise.
[01:08:25.066 --> 01:08:26.586]  But I do Extend-A-Wise every morning.
[01:08:26.686 --> 01:08:28.347]  It's 60% off right now.
[01:08:28.427 --> 01:08:30.267]  Just read all the five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:35.769]  But, I mean, this is the type of product... I mean, yeah, we have the best krill oil at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:37.729]  We have the best fish oil at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:43.330]  We just put out the best because that's, you know, the market is fish oil, krill oil.
[01:08:44.151 --> 01:08:45.931]  But we made Extend-A-Wise.
[01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:51.392]  Like, that's a totally unique supplement in and of itself, and we never even talk about it.
[01:08:52.673 --> 01:08:53.453]  And it's awesome.
[01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:55.281]  For so many different reasons.
[01:08:56.002 --> 01:08:57.942]  And it's 60% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:08:57.982 --> 01:09:04.104]  Part of the Memorial Day Mega Sale happening at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:09:05.425 --> 01:09:06.345]  50% off bodies.
[01:09:06.565 --> 01:09:07.466]  Incredible supplement.
[01:09:07.486 --> 01:09:09.186]  50% off Supermail Vitality.
[01:09:09.486 --> 01:09:14.888]  I love how Tom Papert said it from Big League Politics, who hosts the 4th Hour here sometimes.
[01:09:15.489 --> 01:09:21.951]  He didn't realize how much time was in the day until he started taking Supermail Vitality and he could actually seize the day.
[01:09:22.915 --> 01:09:23.535]  Carpe Diem.
[01:09:24.056 --> 01:09:26.017]  With super male vitality.
[01:09:26.077 --> 01:09:26.898]  The protein bars.
[01:09:26.958 --> 01:09:29.019]  People love our protein bars.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.382]  I like the peanut butter chocolate ones, personally.
[01:09:32.922 --> 01:09:38.246]  It tastes like a double fudge brownie with peanuts inside of it and a peanut butter coating.
[01:09:38.846 --> 01:09:40.247]  Try it for yourself, if you don't believe me.
[01:09:40.287 --> 01:09:41.328]  That's what it tastes like.
[01:09:41.808 --> 01:09:42.729]  The Survival Shield X2.
[01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:49.514]  The nascent iodine in Survival Shield X2 is a life-changing product.
[01:09:50.034 --> 01:09:50.755]  That's not a joke.
[01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:53.213]  Read the reviews for yourself.
[01:09:53.414 --> 01:09:54.034]  Give it a try.
[01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:57.097]  It's on sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:09:57.117 --> 01:10:03.703]  But if you're not into supplements, we've also got t-shirts and hats, air filters, water filters, emergency food supplies.
[01:10:04.424 --> 01:10:06.966]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:07.146 --> 01:10:09.909]  Heck, if you're a camper, we got a lot of people that like to go camping around here.
[01:10:10.309 --> 01:10:16.455]  If you're a camper, the preparedness gear and the survival gear at InfoWarsStore.com is like the best.
[01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:25.918]  For food and food preparation and water purification, it's the best.
[01:10:26.939 --> 01:10:34.503]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com and of course, you know, your support at InfoWarsStore.com today makes sure that we are on air tomorrow.
[01:10:34.983 --> 01:10:36.544]  So thank you for your support.
[01:10:36.644 --> 01:10:36.945]  Okay.
[01:10:38.385 --> 01:10:45.570]  The lines are lit up and people are responding to the Mueller statement.
[01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:48.171]  So let's start with Jose in North Carolina.
[01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:48.872]  Go ahead, Jose.
[01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:52.763]  Hey, good afternoon.
[01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:55.064]  First time caller.
[01:10:56.465 --> 01:11:10.154]  I just wanted to honestly, I'm just commenting on things that yourself and others have said concerning just at least the seeming behavior of people lately.
[01:11:11.715 --> 01:11:17.019]  The mind control that's going on, I mean, it's so unfortunate.
[01:11:18.601 --> 01:11:34.952]  Concerning, you know, they're soared in the water, there's a flicker rate going on with their favorite device, you know, TV, their cell phone and whatnot, and then there's the constant repetition from the devices that, you know, whatever their so-called use sources are.
[01:11:35.733 --> 01:11:45.099]  It's rather sad, at least from my perception, that it seems like they don't have a chance because they're stuck in a bad habit.
[01:11:46.075 --> 01:11:47.236]  So it's like, oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:11:47.256 --> 01:11:51.078]  So you're like, you're stuck in a loop and you can't get off the track.
[01:11:53.119 --> 01:11:53.479]  Exactly.
[01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:54.679]  Exactly.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.540]  And they're stuck in it.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.221]  It's unfortunate.
[01:11:59.522 --> 01:12:13.629]  Like my neighbors, for example, it'll take them a while for them to even try, you know, filtering their own water and, you know, super blue, you know, fluoride-free toothpaste, for example.
[01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:15.998]  You know, just at least that.
[01:12:16.358 --> 01:12:40.172]  But where I'm coming from has to do with the science of this and also the spiritual side of this, because it seems like amongst my personal friends who know better and have better, I'll say, life habits, we seem to have a certain immunity
[01:12:42.063 --> 01:12:46.945]  To, you know, the GMO and the poisons and the general environment.
[01:12:46.965 --> 01:12:50.386]  I don't know if that's a blanket statement, but it seems to be true here.
[01:12:51.146 --> 01:13:04.151]  No, that's like the old, uh, there's like an episode of Futurama where these brainwaves are brainwashing the whole Earth except Fry, because he's from a different century, so he has different frequencies of the brain, and he's able to save the Earth even though he's like the dumbest person.
[01:13:06.172 --> 01:13:11.254]  Yeah, yeah, but you know, uh, but that right there, the bit of pop culture reference,
[01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:18.081]  That's honestly what got me curious and what led me to checking out InfoWars years ago.
[01:13:19.781 --> 01:13:25.563]  Just being curious about, you know, all this sci-fi stuff, and it turns out to be real.
[01:13:26.963 --> 01:13:33.165]  My big wake-up moment, and this is a personal story, don't have anything to back it up, no, but I'll just go ahead and say it.
[01:13:35.646 --> 01:13:38.767]  I was basically recruited into the military with G.I.
[01:13:38.807 --> 01:13:40.207]  Joe cartoons back in the day.
[01:13:41.677 --> 01:13:45.019]  And I ended up working for the U.S.
[01:13:45.119 --> 01:13:46.901]  Air Force, 71st Rescue Squadron.
[01:13:47.601 --> 01:13:54.786]  I was the supply manager, so I had access to what back then was called a standard-based supply system.
[01:13:55.726 --> 01:14:06.753]  And I had a moment, I was working a graveyard shift, and I looked up this particular action figure that was one of my favorite ones as a kid.
[01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:16.214]  The codename of the figure was Psych-Out, and he was the Deceptive Warfare Specialist.
[01:14:17.194 --> 01:14:26.776]  I thought that figure was cool, because with his particular equipment, according to the fake dossier in the back of the action figure, you could convince the enemy to basically give up.
[01:14:27.936 --> 01:14:32.417]  Which appealed to me back then, you know, because I wanted to be one of the good guys, and that's what good guys do.
[01:14:33.117 --> 01:14:37.778]  But then years later, I just tapped into Deceptive Warfare Equipment,
[01:14:38.385 --> 01:14:38.565]  I don't
[01:14:56.078 --> 01:15:04.867]  Well, and let's not even forget, there was a leaked document that showed governments were testing with cell phone frequencies on how to control people's minds.
[01:15:04.887 --> 01:15:07.149]  There have been other things that have been leaked.
[01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.654]  So, there was the document, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[01:15:13.135 --> 01:15:13.756]  So it's out there.
[01:15:15.474 --> 01:15:15.835]  It is.
[01:15:16.035 --> 01:15:16.836]  It totally is.
[01:15:17.276 --> 01:15:19.338]  It's right there at everyone's fingertips.
[01:15:19.458 --> 01:15:21.980]  All they have to do is tap on it, kind of like... But that's it.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.922]  But it comes back to what you said at the outset, Jose.
[01:15:25.202 --> 01:15:26.583]  These people are stuck in a loop.
[01:15:27.364 --> 01:15:29.306]  And so they can't get outside of that loop.
[01:15:31.067 --> 01:15:32.208]  And that's why it's so frustrating.
[01:15:32.268 --> 01:15:33.669]  Great call, Jose, North Carolina.
[01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:34.730]  Great first-time caller.
[01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:35.851]  Amazing.
[01:15:37.773 --> 01:15:42.957]  That's what's so amazing about this is that it should be an event like this that shakes you out of that loop.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.100]  Because, I mean, I have friends that are liberals.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.401]  I have friends that vote Democrat.
[01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:49.961]  They never believed any of this Russian collusion stuff.
[01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:51.961]  How can somebody believe this garbage?
[01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:55.002]  Hate Trump all you want, think he's the worst thing in the world.
[01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:58.943]  Don't buy into the CIA propaganda!
[01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:10.685]  I didn't go to college for marketing.
[01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.911]  I don't sit around and have traditional marketing meetings.
[01:16:14.391 --> 01:16:17.193]  I go with my gut and how I want to be treated.
[01:16:18.453 --> 01:16:19.494]  So I do market research.
[01:16:19.694 --> 01:16:20.814]  What's already the highest rated?
[01:16:21.515 --> 01:16:23.516]  What already is the best selling?
[01:16:24.096 --> 01:16:24.956]  And then we go look at it.
[01:16:25.637 --> 01:16:28.038]  We make it better and sell it for a lower price.
[01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:30.479]  Viewers and listeners understand my philosophy.
[01:16:30.859 --> 01:16:31.620]  And you've responded.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:38.323]  We have a very large successful supplement company because the quality is amazing and because of your support.
[01:16:42.156 --> 01:16:47.521]  Looking into this a few years ago, I was like, you know, I forget to take supplements myself, and our listeners forget.
[01:16:48.142 --> 01:16:50.604]  How do I get myself and others to remember to take it?
[01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:56.069]  And my crew, who was just getting into marketing, goes, it's funny you say that, boss.
[01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:00.633]  Everything for 20 years, and now more than ever, is PAX.
[01:17:02.003 --> 01:17:04.184]  One pack a day, two packs a day, three packs a day.
[01:17:04.504 --> 01:17:05.404]  So it's all there.
[01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:06.264]  You don't forget.
[01:17:06.284 --> 01:17:07.184]  It's on a bunch of bottles.
[01:17:07.524 --> 01:17:08.425]  You put it in your pocket.
[01:17:08.465 --> 01:17:09.185]  You put it in your purse.
[01:17:09.205 --> 01:17:09.905]  You put it in your wallet.
[01:17:10.085 --> 01:17:11.245]  You put it in your car, your truck.
[01:17:11.345 --> 01:17:11.745]  It's ready.
[01:17:12.365 --> 01:17:14.386]  That's the 8-pack Power Stack.
[01:17:15.206 --> 01:17:19.707]  And out of the gates, we're offering it at 50% off.
[01:17:19.907 --> 01:17:23.568]  Very close to what it costs us to make.

[01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:30.412]  And 13 pills, 8 new formulas.
[01:17:31.293 --> 01:17:32.114]  It's amazing.

[01:17:57.365 --> 01:17:58.645]  All those work together synergistically.

[01:18:10.232 --> 01:18:10.832]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:18:12.372 --> 01:18:15.417]  Comparable packs that aren't even as good are retail $125.
[01:18:15.478 --> 01:18:17.942]  This is retail up there like a hundred bucks.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.941]  It is, right now ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[01:18:26.521 --> 01:18:32.023]  A major gamble for us because I believe you're going to reorder it close to the regular price and support the info we're after.

[01:18:37.905 --> 01:18:39.546]  I work 18 hours a day many days.
[01:18:39.866 --> 01:18:41.086]  I take on the weight of the world.
[01:18:41.226 --> 01:18:46.468]  I focus on the injustice and I face the enemy and I fight them at every level.
[01:18:47.248 --> 01:18:51.871]  And there's no way, without the supplements from InForestLife.com, I could do it.

[01:19:43.734 --> 01:19:45.535]  These are the very best
[01:19:47.338 --> 01:19:56.240]  13 capsules, 8 new formulas that we could bring you that just does things for every part of your body, every part of your system.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:02.341]  We looked at the best selling products out there and we made it even better and we lowered the price.
[01:20:06.422 --> 01:20:09.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:43.731]  What upsets me is how even the average consumer of news, but you know what?
[01:20:44.451 --> 01:20:52.753]  It really is happening, but the average consumer of news just watching everything going on and just kind of scratching their heads like, huh?
[01:20:55.034 --> 01:20:55.394]  What?
[01:20:56.114 --> 01:20:56.834]  They're doing what?
[01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:57.534]  They said what?
[01:20:58.774 --> 01:20:59.614]  Calling for impeachment?
[01:20:59.674 --> 01:20:59.935]  What?
[01:21:01.135 --> 01:21:02.055]  Russian collusion still?
[01:21:04.446 --> 01:21:09.128]  So, I mean, this helps Trump in 2020, but I guess they think they can impeach him before that, maybe?
[01:21:11.049 --> 01:21:11.869]  It's all out of control.
[01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.410]  We're taking your calls on the situation.
[01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:16.091]  Remember, please support us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:16.912 --> 01:21:26.336]  We have massive MAGA Memorial Day specials happening right now, including 60% off some supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:26.376 --> 01:21:30.298]  So please support us at InfoWarsStore.com today to keep us on air tomorrow.
[01:21:32.062 --> 01:21:38.725]  And we're taking your calls right now on the Mueller statement and what has followed in the short period of time since.
[01:21:39.445 --> 01:21:41.146]  And Jeremy in California disagrees with me.
[01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:41.807]  I'm not sure on what.
[01:21:41.847 --> 01:21:43.027]  It just says disagree on the board.
[01:21:43.047 --> 01:21:43.707]  So we'll find out.
[01:21:43.767 --> 01:21:44.948]  Jeremy in California, go ahead.
[01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:47.869]  Hey, dude.
[01:21:47.989 --> 01:21:51.291]  Well, before I trigger you, let me explain to you why I disagree with you.
[01:21:52.505 --> 01:21:54.807]  First of all, I don't believe there was any collusion.
[01:21:55.308 --> 01:21:57.469]  I don't believe that narrative at all.
[01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:04.255]  I definitely think that WikiLeaks was fed their sourcing from probably somebody from the inside.
[01:22:04.475 --> 01:22:06.036]  So that's the track I'm on.
[01:22:06.216 --> 01:22:16.224]  However, with regard to obstruction, unfortunately, President Trump may have ensnared himself because he couldn't control himself.
[01:22:17.305 --> 01:22:21.168]  And I think before you just say, hey, this is some big CIA hoax.
[01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:33.953]  You realize that obstruction of justice, there doesn't have to be a crime that's proven, that just protecting yourself, if you interfere with an investigation, you could put yourself into jeopardy.
[01:22:34.634 --> 01:22:44.061]  So, if we step back for a second and say, well, if this was President Obama in the same situation, okay, he didn't collude, but he certainly tried to block things.
[01:22:44.381 --> 01:22:45.282]  We'd be freaking out.
[01:22:45.963 --> 01:22:48.725]  But what did Trump do to try to block anything?
[01:22:49.807 --> 01:22:57.773]  He got involved, the admittance to firing Comey, the admittance, or not the admittance- That was a recommendation of Rosenstein.
[01:22:57.793 --> 01:22:58.093]  Right.
[01:22:58.533 --> 01:23:02.196]  But documented, but he was vocal about it and he said why he did it, man.
[01:23:02.316 --> 01:23:03.176]  That's the problem.
[01:23:03.697 --> 01:23:06.919]  But the Democrats were calling for the firing of Comey before that even happened.
[01:23:07.659 --> 01:23:12.463]  Right, but still, the point is, is Trump gave his justification as to why it happened.
[01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:15.685]  The conduct involving Cohen.
[01:23:16.656 --> 01:23:18.356]  You know, and getting involved there.
[01:23:18.376 --> 01:23:21.797]  What conduct with Cohen?
[01:23:22.037 --> 01:23:22.798]  What conduct with Cohen?
[01:23:23.938 --> 01:23:27.359]  Dude, inferring pardons, all these various different types of things.
[01:23:27.459 --> 01:23:28.439]  Inferring pardons?
[01:23:28.479 --> 01:23:29.319]  What are you talking about?
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:35.221]  If you start to look into, you know, poke around in Volume 2 of the Mueller Report,
[01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:39.385]  You're gonna find some stuff there that isn't favorable to the President.
[01:23:39.485 --> 01:23:45.013]  And yes, even if you don't... So Jeremy, so let's say that Trump made a misstep or whatever.
[01:23:45.513 --> 01:23:47.175]  Okay, so but hold on now.
[01:23:48.018 --> 01:23:51.120]  But you agree the Russian collusion narrative is fake news, right?
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.340]  Totally!
[01:23:52.801 --> 01:24:00.405]  So you're okay then with them starting something entirely phony, investing a ridiculous investigation that goes on.
[01:24:00.905 --> 01:24:06.088]  Trump has a crooked toenail somewhere, it stubs his toe, and so he should be impeached and removed and he's bad because of that?
[01:24:06.828 --> 01:24:08.589]  Right, here's my opinion on that.
[01:24:09.089 --> 01:24:09.930]  Is that Trump
[01:24:10.558 --> 01:24:15.303]  Unfortunately, he had every right to be angry and to throw a tantrum.
[01:24:15.463 --> 01:24:19.628]  The problem is, Owen, he threw what may be an illegal tantrum.
[01:24:20.509 --> 01:24:22.250]  And that's his problem.
[01:24:22.531 --> 01:24:22.811]  What?
[01:24:23.151 --> 01:24:24.313]  What did he do that's illegal?
[01:24:26.124 --> 01:24:30.446]  Listen, there doesn't have to be a crime to obstruct justice.
[01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:31.686]  You need to look into that.
[01:24:31.726 --> 01:24:33.427]  There doesn't need to be a crime.
[01:24:33.967 --> 01:24:40.230]  You can just be protecting yourself, but you're still obstructing information from flowing.
[01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:41.511]  This is the problem.
[01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:43.069]  And that's the problem?
[01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:45.033]  No, I'm sorry, but that's where you're wrong.
[01:24:45.153 --> 01:24:48.618]  You cannot obstruct justice when there is no crime present.
[01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:50.181]  That's literally impossible.
[01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:53.366]  What you're talking about is processed crimes here, Jeremy.
[01:24:54.187 --> 01:24:55.309]  That's a totally different thing.
[01:24:56.112 --> 01:25:04.136]  I would ask you to reach out to Paul Craig Roberts or somebody like that who maybe has a little more insight than me who's just reading and really no legal expert.
[01:25:04.476 --> 01:25:05.717]  Dude, this is just my opinion.
[01:25:05.957 --> 01:25:08.458]  But you're not even giving a specific example.
[01:25:09.079 --> 01:25:10.800]  You're just saying Trump threw a temper tantrum.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.540]  I wish he would throw a temper tantrum.
[01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:13.761]  I'm sick of this.
[01:25:13.981 --> 01:25:15.082]  I'd throw them all in jail.
[01:25:15.102 --> 01:25:16.062]  We know what happened here.
[01:25:17.603 --> 01:25:18.844]  The termination of Comey.
[01:25:18.904 --> 01:25:20.504]  The appointment of a special counsel.
[01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:23.825]  Again, you keep going to the termination of Comey.
[01:25:23.865 --> 01:25:27.087]  The Democrats called for it and it was a suggestion by Rosenstein.
[01:25:27.707 --> 01:25:30.308]  Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence.
[01:25:30.948 --> 01:25:32.969]  That never happened.
[01:25:33.029 --> 01:25:34.069]  That literally never happened.
[01:25:34.109 --> 01:25:35.150]  The exact opposite happened.
[01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.450]  He's about to declassify everything.
[01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:38.771]  He's already declassified the whole Mueller report out there.
[01:25:38.991 --> 01:25:40.412]  So what information are they withholding?
[01:25:41.112 --> 01:25:43.333]  And I agree, investigate the investigators.
[01:25:44.059 --> 01:25:49.084]  But in the meantime, Trump may have thrown an illegal tantrum.
[01:25:49.684 --> 01:25:51.165]  And that's the thing, man.
[01:25:51.205 --> 01:25:52.707]  He may have done this to himself.
[01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:54.524]  And that's the problem.
[01:25:54.804 --> 01:25:58.725]  If he did 50%... No, no, no.
[01:25:58.785 --> 01:26:07.147]  The problem is we have a corrupt deep state that set the president up, engaged in a coup, tried to stop a duly elected man from getting into office.
[01:26:07.347 --> 01:26:08.127]  That's the problem.
[01:26:08.307 --> 01:26:13.748]  If Donald Trump stubs his toe in the midst of this ridiculous investigation, that's not the problem.
[01:26:13.948 --> 01:26:15.308]  So that's where we disagree, Jeremy.
[01:26:15.428 --> 01:26:16.148]  Great call, though.
[01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:18.789]  Let's go to Lydia in Indiana.
[01:26:18.869 --> 01:26:19.529]  Go ahead, Lydia.
[01:26:21.485 --> 01:26:21.865]  Hi.
[01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:34.513]  I first want to say that I'm a first-time caller, and I also started taking your iodine drops, because I have problems with my thyroid and my nails and some other areas that deal with thyroid are already getting better.
[01:26:34.913 --> 01:26:36.434]  So thank you for that product.
[01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:49.182]  But as to my comment, hearing what Mueller has said, now I kind of understand why Pelosi started saying that the President is in a cover-up.
[01:26:50.556 --> 01:27:07.395]  I think those two go hand in hand, and it just irritates me that people keep going back to President Obama, but certain actions occur that had nothing to do with it that still need to be looked into.
[01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:22.599]  The false FISA warrant, the Steele dossier, Hillary's private server, none of that had anything to do with... Oh yeah, and by the way Lydia, with the Christopher Steele not cooperating, there's about to be more coming out with that.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:30.205]  This wasn't just a domestic spy operation, this wasn't just a domestic coup, this was an international coup against Donald Trump.
[01:27:33.568 --> 01:27:37.431]  Yeah, looking at everything that's going on in Europe, I can understand what you're saying there, yeah.
[01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:40.231]  I mean, it's all gonna come out.
[01:27:40.271 --> 01:27:44.174]  I mean, you had multiple... I mean, they already admit Russian intelligence was involved.
[01:27:45.174 --> 01:27:46.675]  Who knows what their role was, really?
[01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:52.359]  You had MI6 involved, Australian spy... I mean, it's out of control!
[01:27:52.379 --> 01:27:57.042]  And the Joe Biden stuff and his son now with the Ukraine?
[01:27:57.682 --> 01:27:59.844]  Again, nothing to do with Trump.
[01:27:59.904 --> 01:28:04.467]  But hey, if Trump's having a cover-up, then they can put everything else under the rug underneath that.
[01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:08.291]  To hear what Mueller said today, it just makes me mad.
[01:28:10.232 --> 01:28:13.374]  Well, I think that a lot of people are going to be mad on both sides of the aisle.
[01:28:13.434 --> 01:28:16.636]  Because Mueller, he's not going to deliver what the Democrats want.
[01:28:16.696 --> 01:28:17.196]  He can't.
[01:28:17.296 --> 01:28:18.097]  There's nothing there.
[01:28:18.437 --> 01:28:23.580]  He's not going to give a testimony before Congress because he knows that'll just blow up in his face and embarrass him.
[01:28:24.041 --> 01:28:26.442]  So, both sides are going to be upset by this.
[01:28:28.263 --> 01:28:29.984]  Again, though, I'm just stunned.
[01:28:30.565 --> 01:28:33.046]  I'm just stunned that people can't see this.
[01:28:33.186 --> 01:28:33.827]  Anything else, Lydia?
[01:28:35.296 --> 01:28:35.757]  Uh, no.
[01:28:36.617 --> 01:28:38.840]  Well, thank you so much for shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.664]  I'm so glad to hear that the Survival Shield X2 worked for you, but that's why we put it out there.
[01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:58.098]  Yeah, there's actually a lot of thyroid problems in this country, and because of a lack of iodine, if you have a problem like that, go to InfoWarsTore.com, get the Survival Shield X2 today, and you will notice the difference, as Lydia just said.
[01:28:58.118 --> 01:28:59.700]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:29:03.291 --> 01:29:05.952]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts!
[01:29:06.872 --> 01:29:09.553]  I'm going to transition into a woman!
[01:29:09.973 --> 01:29:10.654]  It'll be great!
[01:29:10.914 --> 01:29:23.558]  You should crawl back into your mother's rancid womb, gestate for a few more hours, climb back out, and then learn something about not being an entitled, white, piece of sh**!
[01:29:23.778 --> 01:29:24.599]  This is Trump, people!
[01:29:25.619 --> 01:29:26.981]  When the rock meets the road?
[01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:28.222]  Pussies!
[01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:29.543]  Yeah, you're a f***ing idiot.
[01:29:29.563 --> 01:29:30.904]  F*** you, capitalism!
[01:29:30.925 --> 01:29:31.745]  F*** you, f***ing president!
[01:29:32.046 --> 01:29:34.388]  He's a racist, stupid piece of s***!
[01:29:34.588 --> 01:29:38.312]  If you guys are working for Alex Jones, you're working for a murderer!
[01:29:38.432 --> 01:29:40.534]  Alex Jones is an a**hole.
[01:29:40.754 --> 01:29:43.116]  Danfoe Wards is fake news!
[01:29:46.479 --> 01:29:47.399]  I got a chair going.
[01:29:47.579 --> 01:29:52.581]  If you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[01:29:53.022 --> 01:29:53.302]  You.
[01:29:53.322 --> 01:29:55.182]  Give me my money back.
[01:29:55.263 --> 01:29:57.503]  Excuse me, sir.
[01:29:57.603 --> 01:29:58.884]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[01:29:58.984 --> 01:30:01.085]  This is what's happening to the men in our country.
[01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:02.405]  Where are the men?
[01:30:02.425 --> 01:30:03.886]  Stop touching my stuff.
[01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:05.066]  I'm backing away.
[01:30:05.247 --> 01:30:05.687]  Stop.
[01:30:05.927 --> 01:30:06.307]  Dude, stop!
[01:30:10.269 --> 01:30:12.592]  Why are you doing that?
[01:30:12.752 --> 01:30:15.275]  Get the f***ing stuff in and don't film it!
[01:30:15.355 --> 01:30:16.997]  You're not allowed!
[01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:19.820]  You can't use it!
[01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:21.102]  Please do not touch me!
[01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:22.564]  Please do not touch me!
[01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:23.885]  Once again, it's Mayer!
[01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:25.467]  Mayer, she said both of you died.
[01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:28.270]  Right beforehand, you f***ing said, sir!
[01:30:34.016 --> 01:30:35.076]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:35.576 --> 01:30:36.777]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:36.817 --> 01:30:37.617]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:37.757 --> 01:30:39.897]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:39.997 --> 01:30:43.978]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.538]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:45.578 --> 01:30:47.498]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:47.538 --> 01:30:48.639]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:49.719 --> 01:30:51.379]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:51.419 --> 01:30:52.059]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:56.600]  Motherfuckers!
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.920]  Motherfuckers!
[01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:06.462]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:31:06.502 --> 01:31:08.944]  Get these people the hell out of here right now!
[01:31:09.204 --> 01:31:10.464]  F**k off!
[01:31:10.524 --> 01:31:14.007]  I don't give a f**k!
[01:31:14.527 --> 01:31:15.387]  Get out!
[01:31:15.728 --> 01:31:20.571]  Holy s**t!
[01:31:20.611 --> 01:31:21.051]  Please!
[01:31:21.271 --> 01:31:22.172]  Please!
[01:31:22.192 --> 01:31:22.532]  Please!
[01:31:45.262 --> 01:31:52.750]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:53.470]  Changed my life.
[01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:55.993]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[01:31:56.033 --> 01:31:57.755]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[01:31:57.955 --> 01:32:05.282]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on it.
[01:32:06.922 --> 01:32:12.063]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:32:12.083 --> 01:32:19.605]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[01:32:19.645 --> 01:32:26.206]  You want to order it again, but PQQ CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[01:32:26.346 --> 01:32:28.546]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[01:32:28.766 --> 01:32:31.887]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[01:32:31.907 --> 01:32:33.087]  What did you think of the X2?
[01:32:33.627 --> 01:32:34.468]  I love that, too.
[01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:39.291]  Like, after a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words, you know?
[01:32:39.311 --> 01:32:51.039]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't, you know, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but, you know, you feel like you want to get in a conversation, and you're pausing, and you can't find the word to say, and I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[01:32:51.079 --> 01:32:53.861]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[01:32:53.881 --> 01:32:54.581]  It's electrochemical.
[01:32:54.601 --> 01:32:55.382]  You're absolutely right.
[01:32:55.422 --> 01:32:59.124]  When I forget to take X2 every couple days, sometimes I forget for, like, a week because I get busy.
[01:32:59.244 --> 01:33:01.786]  Then I feel it, and I take it, and it really is amazing.
[01:33:01.866 --> 01:33:02.987]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:08.574]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.515 --> 01:33:29.078]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.579 --> 01:33:32.780]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:34.221 --> 01:33:47.468]  Well, the hot topic is obviously Mueller's statements and the response to them.
[01:33:48.808 --> 01:33:49.669]  People are already
[01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:54.882]  I'm guessing Mueller's going to end up at MSNBC or CNN.
[01:33:54.922 --> 01:33:57.723]  Boy, wouldn't that be right in your face.
[01:33:58.003 --> 01:33:59.344]  And the left still wouldn't see it.
[01:34:00.264 --> 01:34:05.046]  And we're taking your calls, but I want to read the press statement from Sarah Sanders, just released.
[01:34:08.615 --> 01:34:11.978]  Has completed the investigation, closed his office and has closed the case.
[01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:18.765]  Mr. Mueller explicitly said that he has nothing to add beyond the report and therefore does not plan to testify before Congress.
[01:34:19.066 --> 01:34:19.907]  The report was clear.
[01:34:20.227 --> 01:34:25.072]  There was no collusion, no conspiracy and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction.
[01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:28.335]  Special Counsel Mueller also stated that Attorney General
[01:34:29.136 --> 01:34:31.757]  Barr acted in good faith in his handling of the report.
[01:34:32.277 --> 01:34:35.938]  After two years, the special counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same.
[01:34:36.098 --> 01:34:43.400]  No, the Democrats are now getting ready for impeachment, and the left is getting ready to protest for another year straight, claiming Russian collusion with no evidence.
[01:34:44.221 --> 01:34:46.581]  So, we go back to your phone calls.
[01:34:46.901 --> 01:34:49.082]  Let's go to Jesse calling in from Idaho.
[01:34:49.482 --> 01:34:50.242]  Go ahead, Jesse.
[01:34:52.603 --> 01:34:53.083]  Hey, Owen.
[01:34:53.263 --> 01:34:58.385]  I just wanted to kind of touch on that C-SPAN caller that you played earlier on.
[01:34:59.383 --> 01:35:01.244]  You know, Mueller's report this morning.
[01:35:02.785 --> 01:35:10.591]  She's kind of like a poster child for the silencing that's been going on, the suppression of InfoWars and everybody else.
[01:35:11.332 --> 01:35:15.815]  She's exactly what they're trying to create by silencing everybody around us.
[01:35:16.195 --> 01:35:22.880]  Because if you had five minutes with someone like her, you could have her that passionate against her own party if she actually knew the truth.
[01:35:23.643 --> 01:35:30.728]  You know, it's an interesting thought, Jesse, because I've gone out to these events and I've tried to have the discussions with these people.
[01:35:31.148 --> 01:35:32.969]  I know the timing is obviously different now.
[01:35:33.529 --> 01:35:34.090]  But who knows?
[01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:37.692]  My guess is that lady's probably heard of InfoWars and thinks we're the worst thing on Earth.
[01:35:38.192 --> 01:35:39.834]  Because that's the propaganda.
[01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:40.694]  I don't doubt that.
[01:35:40.714 --> 01:35:46.098]  I mean, I've seen every one of your YouTube videos and I see how they, you know, they can take exactly what you say and don't even care.
[01:35:47.017 --> 01:35:52.261]  I feel like she's definitely a poster child for, you know, they want to create more of her.
[01:35:52.542 --> 01:35:53.062]  No, that's right.
[01:35:53.122 --> 01:36:08.335]  They want the sobering, just fumbling, bumbling, stumbling people out there to have no clue what's going on and somehow just believe whatever they are told to from whatever sources they're told to believe.
[01:36:09.502 --> 01:36:20.149]  And they'll see what they want, kind of like how she mentioned that, oh, Mueller, they'll stop Mueller from testifying, and when he specifically said that he doesn't want to, there's no point in it.
[01:36:21.369 --> 01:36:28.654]  Mueller could hold up a blue marker and say, this is a blue marker, and every single one of them would be like, oh no, that's black, he's trying to tell us something, you know?
[01:36:29.054 --> 01:36:31.636]  Yeah, that's Trump confusing Mueller's color.
[01:36:31.836 --> 01:36:33.417]  Trump made Mueller colorblind, yeah.
[01:36:34.406 --> 01:36:35.367]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:36:35.607 --> 01:36:42.692]  And then also, one of your callers that called earlier that was kind of disagreeing with you, he kind of mentioned the firing of Comey.
[01:36:43.153 --> 01:36:55.442]  The firing of Comey would only be obstruction of justice if Trump had committed a crime and he knew Comey was gonna expose his crimes, so therefore Trump fired him to keep that from being exposed.
[01:36:55.742 --> 01:37:00.025]  But there's no crime to begin with for him to try and, you know, hide it.
[01:37:01.246 --> 01:37:03.528]  Yeah, plus it was a recommendation
[01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:05.310]  Oh hey, Owen.
[01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:07.652]  I just wanted to talk about something I had seen.
[01:37:07.692 --> 01:37:10.454]  I was watching C-SPAN right before the Mueller came out.
[01:37:32.891 --> 01:37:36.854]  They had just turned the cameras on, turned the mics on, and there were two women sitting in the front row.
[01:37:37.655 --> 01:37:41.898]  And they started laughing, and it had to be warned that they were on a hot mic.
[01:37:42.919 --> 01:37:52.967]  And when they found that out, man, they were just... They were pretty shocked, to say the least, both physically and, you know, verbally.
[01:37:53.888 --> 01:38:02.135]  So it just kind of goes to say, you know, why do reporters need to be warned of a hot mic before they can act with a little integrity?
[01:38:03.405 --> 01:38:04.966]  And then, you know, I wonder what they said.
[01:38:05.826 --> 01:38:07.767]  Are they, you know, colluding with each other?
[01:38:07.787 --> 01:38:10.007]  Is it conspiracy through the media?
[01:38:12.048 --> 01:38:14.609]  You know, I obviously didn't see what you're talking about.
[01:38:14.829 --> 01:38:18.990]  My guess is it's probably just a couple of journos just gossiping.
[01:38:20.631 --> 01:38:24.312]  Well, they seem pretty shocked when they found out they were on Hot Mike.
[01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:26.313]  Well, you'd be pretty shocked what journos in D.C.
[01:38:26.353 --> 01:38:26.953]  gossip about.
[01:38:26.973 --> 01:38:32.875]  Well, I just thought if you guys could find that
[01:38:33.827 --> 01:38:34.907]  See what they said, you know.
[01:38:35.848 --> 01:38:38.929]  I went back to look at it, and it was live video.
[01:38:38.969 --> 01:38:39.729]  I couldn't rewind it.
[01:38:39.929 --> 01:38:40.989]  Was it on C-SPAN?
[01:38:41.269 --> 01:38:43.210]  You said just on where they aired the Mueller statement?
[01:38:44.250 --> 01:38:46.751]  Yeah, but going back to C-SPAN, they start it right at Mueller.
[01:38:46.791 --> 01:38:48.551]  They don't start it 10 minutes before.
[01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:53.533]  All right, well, we'll have the crew investigate, see if they can find that.
[01:38:53.573 --> 01:38:54.373]  Thanks for the call, Phillip.
[01:38:54.393 --> 01:39:00.135]  Let's squeeze in Jeff here from Canada on the caller 2.
[01:39:00.275 --> 01:39:00.855]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:39:02.728 --> 01:39:05.070]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[01:39:05.451 --> 01:39:14.779]  You know, the Bible says, let the Word of God be confirmed in the mouth of two or three witnesses, and this lady from Livingston, New Jersey, I think is total BS.
[01:39:14.799 --> 01:39:22.306]  I think she's just put in there to trumpet the exact narrative that we're going to hear about for the next
[01:39:22.987 --> 01:39:24.989]  Six months to a year to a year and a half.
[01:39:39.326 --> 01:39:39.706]  I don't know.
[01:39:39.826 --> 01:39:43.609]  I mean, because I can usually tell, I think you can usually tell when that's the case.
[01:39:43.789 --> 01:39:44.949]  I think that woman was genuine.
[01:39:45.309 --> 01:39:49.672]  She didn't really have a strong narrative or talking points.
[01:39:50.072 --> 01:39:52.293]  And by the end of the call, she was just a bumbling idiot.
[01:39:52.854 --> 01:40:00.438]  Usually when they stage a call like that, they have their bullet points ready to go and they sound not so dumb.
[01:40:01.179 --> 01:40:06.842]  But there's no doubt C-SPAN, again, I don't know if it's C-SPAN, but the Democrats stages calls into C-SPAN.
[01:40:08.171 --> 01:40:12.313]  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt if it was staged with everything else that happens.
[01:40:12.814 --> 01:40:21.819]  I mean, Mueller's deep state, the media's deep state, and now to get a third person just out there at the beginning to get the talking points out, I could see it.
[01:40:21.999 --> 01:40:30.164]  If it wasn't, you know, it's still sending the message to the brain-dead people, and it's just a giant fog machine.
[01:40:30.724 --> 01:40:31.345]  That's all it is.
[01:40:32.325 --> 01:40:34.467]  Well, if that's the best staged caller they can get,
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:38.681]  Wow, I guess that's where they're at these days.
[01:40:38.721 --> 01:40:39.461]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[01:40:39.501 --> 01:40:41.222]  Let's go to Sebastian in Georgia.
[01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:42.623]  Go ahead, Sebastian.
[01:40:44.864 --> 01:40:45.824]  Hey, what's up, Owen?
[01:40:45.864 --> 01:40:46.845]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:40:47.865 --> 01:40:48.425]  Thank you for calling.
[01:40:50.306 --> 01:40:55.148]  I just, I like Barr, AG Barr, more and more, the more they attack him.
[01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:56.789]  Kind of the same way Trump.
[01:40:57.749 --> 01:41:01.051]  And I wonder if he's going to give a good, juicy response to this Mueller
[01:41:03.789 --> 01:41:17.999]  Nothing too juicy so far, and if the president is actually intending on draining the swamp and exposing the treason, then I could see why at this point he would be sitting on his hands waiting patiently.
[01:41:21.622 --> 01:41:22.643]  Well, I can't wait, man.
[01:41:22.663 --> 01:41:25.385]  A couple weeks, hearing all this stuff's gonna be great.
[01:41:29.818 --> 01:41:31.079]  If they get away with it, it won't be.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:31.960]  Tell you that.
[01:41:33.061 --> 01:41:34.242]  People need to go to jail for this.
[01:41:36.404 --> 01:41:37.044]  Hell yeah, man.
[01:41:37.385 --> 01:41:37.885]  Build the wall.
[01:41:38.005 --> 01:41:38.586]  The wall going up.
[01:41:38.606 --> 01:41:40.567]  Yeah, they need a wall.
[01:41:40.727 --> 01:41:42.909]  No doubt about that with the invasion at the southern border.
[01:41:42.949 --> 01:41:43.950]  Thanks for the call, Sebastian.
[01:41:44.511 --> 01:41:46.813]  But let's just be clear before we go to break here.
[01:41:52.938 --> 01:41:57.582]  You had an active coup attempt
[01:41:59.482 --> 01:42:23.216]  to stop Donald Trump from getting elected and then once the signs were he was going to get elected the same people engaging in an active coup then decided to illegally spy on Trump and his campaign and again it's like
[01:42:24.628 --> 01:42:28.751]  If you go with the history repeats itself, then nothing will ever happen.
[01:42:29.232 --> 01:42:36.697]  But if you go with Trump is the real deal and not the typical politician, then maybe something will happen.
[01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:42.402]  But all we can do now is just read and react and wait.
[01:42:44.008 --> 01:42:44.748]  But get ready.
[01:42:45.309 --> 01:42:48.450]  The Democrats are about to go full board on impeachment.
[01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:52.131]  They're about to launch an investigation or a hundred into Trump after this.
[01:42:53.251 --> 01:42:58.694]  And the media is going to be right there parroting impeachment, obstruction of justice the whole time.
[01:42:59.354 --> 01:43:00.154]  That's what's coming next.
[01:43:07.455 --> 01:43:09.397]  The dodo is an extinct bird.
[01:43:09.697 --> 01:43:12.600]  Big, fat, juicy, delicious birds the size of a turkey.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:13.861]  They never had a predator.
[01:43:13.901 --> 01:43:16.563]  There weren't any wolves, there weren't any foxes, there weren't any dogs.
[01:43:16.583 --> 01:43:18.625]  There's nothing but these birds running around on this island.
[01:43:18.825 --> 01:43:23.189]  And within just a few years of sailors finding the island, whaling ships would go stop there.
[01:43:24.190 --> 01:43:27.814]  They just walk up with an oar and just club them in the head and eat them.
[01:43:27.854 --> 01:43:28.815]  Big ol' fat juicy meal.
[01:43:28.975 --> 01:43:31.598]  So the Dodo... People call people a Dodo.
[01:43:31.618 --> 01:43:34.942]  They're stupid and don't care about themselves and fall off the edge of a cliff are stupid.
[01:43:35.002 --> 01:43:36.984]  But it was they'd never seen humans.
[01:43:37.024 --> 01:43:38.225]  They'd never had a predator.
[01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:39.567]  They had no fear.
[01:43:39.647 --> 01:43:40.748]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:43:40.768 --> 01:43:41.549]  If I was a chicken...
[01:43:41.829 --> 01:43:43.390]  I'm running around like my head's cut off.
[01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.631]  And you know why I feel like that?
[01:43:44.671 --> 01:43:45.291]  Why I'm pissed?
[01:43:45.511 --> 01:43:47.633]  Because my instincts are lined up and normal.
[01:43:47.693 --> 01:43:48.834]  We have world government.
[01:43:48.874 --> 01:43:51.095]  We have Democrats saying they're killing babies after they're born.
[01:43:51.175 --> 01:43:53.157]  We have sex education to five-year-olds.
[01:43:53.257 --> 01:43:56.179]  We have total evil Hollywood demoralizing us.
[01:43:56.219 --> 01:43:57.399]  They attack on the family.
[01:43:57.479 --> 01:43:58.220]  All these lies.
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:02.883]  We have criminal collapse news networks calling anyone that doesn't submit to them Nazis.
[01:44:03.023 --> 01:44:06.906]  And then using their fake claim that you're a Nazi to have your bank accounts taken.
[01:44:06.966 --> 01:44:07.926]  That's what the Nazis did.
[01:44:08.086 --> 01:44:08.867]  And as a man,
[01:44:09.167 --> 01:44:15.151]  I become physically angry at this point, and if you don't fundamentally get pissed at that, you're a dodo bird.
[01:44:15.311 --> 01:44:18.192]  Folks, I'm not a dodo bird, and I'm not gonna compare myself to an eagle.
[01:44:18.312 --> 01:44:20.474]  Let me just compare myself to a chicken.
[01:44:20.814 --> 01:44:23.876]  Chicken sees a hawk fly over, that chicken runs for the bushes.
[01:44:24.816 --> 01:44:30.181]  That chicken goes... To tell others, hey, the hawk that eats us, he just flew over.
[01:44:30.401 --> 01:44:35.426]  You see, the Dodos were on that island for probably millions of years and nothing ever ate them.
[01:44:35.446 --> 01:44:37.828]  At least hundreds of thousands, so they didn't have a race memory.
[01:44:37.888 --> 01:44:45.315]  But you can take a chicken or any other creature that's ever been around predators and they know about predators, they know what they look like, even though they
[01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:52.072]  They have instincts.
[01:44:52.773 --> 01:44:53.474]  They have soul.
[01:44:53.995 --> 01:44:54.716]  They have spirit.
[01:44:55.096 --> 01:44:56.778]  Those are transferent to the genetic memory.
[01:44:57.639 --> 01:44:59.722]  Those who aren't upset, you do not have soul.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:22.149]  What it really is, Alex, is I'm getting sick and tired of liberals with their arguments trying to push absolute untruths and illogical conclusions and think that we're just gonna have to believe them because they resort to emotional appeals to try to make everyone feel uncomfortable.
[01:45:22.409 --> 01:45:23.290]  That's what they try to do.
[01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:26.553]  Resort to emotional appeals so that people feel uncomfortable.
[01:45:26.573 --> 01:45:33.198]  They can shut down dialogue and then we can't reach the factual, logical conclusion that they're wrong.
[01:45:33.318 --> 01:45:36.781]  You know what the best way to refute liberal arguments is?
[01:45:37.242 --> 01:45:41.765]  You just go out there and you put a microphone in front of their face and you let them speak.
[01:45:42.166 --> 01:45:50.773]  And ask them to essentially tell you why they support what they support and you will just get a bunch of jibber jabber, cussing, yelling.
[01:45:50.913 --> 01:45:54.375]  You've been interviewing people six, seven years, but intensely the last four.
[01:45:55.376 --> 01:45:57.337]  Obviously, it's getting more extreme.
[01:45:57.377 --> 01:46:00.479]  How would you describe the tenor in the last few years?
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:10.086]  There's definitely an uptick in violence and hostility, and it's not just InfoWars, because I've seen other journalists out there, Breitbart, other media companies, get the same vitriol.
[01:46:10.686 --> 01:46:21.552]  It's an uptick in violence from the left because they are realizing that all these beliefs that they've held and been brainwashed with, that it's no longer going to be their reality.
[01:46:21.772 --> 01:46:22.893]  Because people are waking up.
[01:46:23.153 --> 01:46:31.618]  People are getting red-pilled and they're seeing the truth for what it is and they're panicking because these are your lemmings that want to run off the side of a cliff.
[01:46:31.878 --> 01:46:34.819]  And they'll take humanity with them if we let them.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.601]  And that's why no more silence.
[01:46:38.001 --> 01:46:38.861]  From conservatives.
[01:46:38.962 --> 01:46:45.065]  I ask you, I beg you, conservatives, please do something because these lemmings want to take us off the side of the cliff with them.
[01:46:45.085 --> 01:46:46.305]  Because that's where they're headed.
[01:46:46.906 --> 01:46:48.286]  They want to destroy humanity.
[01:46:48.506 --> 01:46:52.088]  They want our little children, our little boys to be turned into drag queens.
[01:46:52.468 --> 01:46:54.750]  They want our babies aborted and killed.
[01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:56.751]  And they think nothing's wrong with that.
[01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:58.592]  This is where we're heading, Alex.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.583]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.208 --> 01:47:29.663]  Amazing we've reached this point.
[01:47:31.138 --> 01:47:37.140]  State-run propaganda controlling the modern-day Nazi brown shirts.
[01:47:38.901 --> 01:47:50.504]  We're literally battling the equivalent of Joseph Goebbels' Nazi propaganda arm and the Nazi brown shirts that are about to get activated.
[01:47:52.805 --> 01:47:53.805]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[01:47:54.766 --> 01:47:55.306]  It's stunning.
[01:47:57.067 --> 01:47:57.347]  Wow.
[01:47:57.667 --> 01:47:58.227]  And you know what?
[01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:01.691]  This is why they censor InfoWars.
[01:48:01.871 --> 01:48:03.892]  This is why we're not allowed on YouTube today.
[01:48:04.172 --> 01:48:05.953]  This is why we're not allowed on Facebook today.
[01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:07.714]  This is why we're not allowed on Twitter today.
[01:48:08.014 --> 01:48:20.339]  This is why we're not allowed to livestream on the biggest internet highways in the world, because this narrative, this broadcast, this intelligence is not allowed to be out there.
[01:48:20.379 --> 01:48:25.982]  So, the average person is going onto YouTube right now, searching Mueller Report, Mueller Statement.
[01:48:26.502 --> 01:48:28.243]  Normally, before the censorship,
[01:48:28.863 --> 01:48:35.928]  We would be number one up there, the biggest audience this broadcast, and we'd be breaking the paradigm, shattering the false narratives.
[01:48:36.689 --> 01:48:40.071]  We were so successful, they had to kick us off their platforms.
[01:48:41.292 --> 01:48:44.534]  So, the bad news is, the American people can't get the truth.
[01:48:45.835 --> 01:48:47.236]  People around the world can't get the truth.
[01:48:47.276 --> 01:48:48.757]  They cannot get this broadcast.
[01:48:49.518 --> 01:48:58.104]  The good news is, we're still able to broadcast and put this information out there that hopefully you re-amplify and re-upload
[01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:03.082]  So that the people can get it because of your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:04.843 --> 01:49:05.984]  That's what makes it all possible.
[01:49:06.905 --> 01:49:15.512]  And we have the last days, I'm not sure if this is going to last past tonight, but the Memorial Day Mega Sale right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:50:49.315 --> 01:50:53.077]  And you hear the testimonies that people give when they call into the show.
[01:50:53.097 --> 01:50:54.778]  We don't stage that stuff.
[01:50:54.798 --> 01:50:56.379]  Those are real testimonies.
[01:50:56.399 --> 01:50:59.101]  Survival Shield X2 is a real, life-changing product.
[01:51:01.263 --> 01:51:02.464]  You can read the reviews yourself.
[01:51:02.504 --> 01:51:04.966]  You can tune in and hear the reviews when people call in.
[01:51:05.547 --> 01:51:11.012]  But your support at InfowarsStore.com today keeps us on air tomorrow.
[01:51:11.492 --> 01:51:14.435]  And then you need to spread the links and share the broadcast.
[01:51:14.595 --> 01:51:16.616]  This is why we got kicked off of YouTube, folks.
[01:51:16.937 --> 01:51:24.083]  They don't want us on there today when everyone's going on to YouTube to see the response to the Mueller statement, to see what happened really with the Mueller statement.
[01:51:24.483 --> 01:51:25.364]  We used to dominate.
[01:51:25.664 --> 01:51:27.106]  That's how we got Trump over the hump.
[01:51:28.322 --> 01:51:30.705]  That's why they cut our knees out from under us.
[01:51:30.765 --> 01:51:35.831]  But your support at InfoWareStore.com allows us to exist still.
[01:51:36.933 --> 01:51:37.293]  All right.
[01:51:37.854 --> 01:51:39.296]  Let's go back out to the phone lines again.
[01:51:39.316 --> 01:51:41.799]  The hot topic, obviously, the Mueller statement, everything that's following.
[01:51:41.899 --> 01:51:43.561]  Let's go to Brandon in Texas.
[01:51:43.641 --> 01:51:44.342]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:51:46.076 --> 01:51:48.377]  Oh, and thanks a bunch for taking my call, man.
[01:51:48.397 --> 01:51:51.198]  I was out at the Planned Parenthood rally with you guys on Sunday.
[01:51:51.378 --> 01:51:51.739]  Awesome.
[01:51:52.119 --> 01:51:52.639]  Very cool.
[01:51:53.459 --> 01:51:56.241]  Um, just a really quick plug X three.
[01:51:56.641 --> 01:51:56.881]  Okay.
[01:51:56.901 --> 01:52:00.042]  I know we don't hear a lot about X three, the tri iodine for my daughter.
[01:52:00.642 --> 01:52:01.723]  Who's in third grade.
[01:52:03.164 --> 01:52:10.887]  I started giving that and the honor roll fish oil to her about six months ago, and for the first time ever third grade, she had a 1.5
[01:52:16.653 --> 01:52:18.334]  As a third grader, first time ever.
[01:52:18.374 --> 01:52:21.755]  So I, you know, the study, the research has been done over here.
[01:52:21.815 --> 01:52:23.455]  That stuff obviously does something.
[01:52:23.776 --> 01:52:24.796]  So thank you guys for that.
[01:52:24.936 --> 01:52:26.356]  Well, thank you for supporting us, Brandon.
[01:52:27.477 --> 01:52:28.277]  Oh, I love it.
[01:52:28.577 --> 01:52:31.478]  So what I have, what I want to talk to you about, Owen, is just really two part.
[01:52:31.518 --> 01:52:38.681]  The first part is with Mueller's appearance, public appearance here, it's just fodder, right?
[01:52:38.801 --> 01:52:40.301]  For the machine.
[01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:41.902]  It's just more breadcrumbs.
[01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:44.101]  So they can drag this narrative on.
[01:52:45.742 --> 01:52:46.822]  Well, you're exactly right.
[01:52:46.902 --> 01:52:53.043]  And that's why I made the statement at the outset saying, you know, I realize that this is all smoke and mirrors and a distraction.
[01:52:53.543 --> 01:52:58.485]  But at the same time, it's important to expose the false narrative and what they're trying to do right now.
[01:52:59.765 --> 01:52:59.945]  Right.
[01:53:00.005 --> 01:53:04.826]  And more importantly, let's expose that if Mueller thinks he's just going to slither off into the private sector,
[01:53:05.293 --> 01:53:11.235]  Without having to answer for his, his, his Epstein and Lord knows who else he's been covering up for.
[01:53:11.595 --> 01:53:16.917]  And the content of the WikiLeaks, let's face it, what, it's cryptographically verified.
[01:53:16.997 --> 01:53:18.257]  It's still online.
[01:53:18.938 --> 01:53:20.338]  Let's talk about what's in there.
[01:53:20.398 --> 01:53:24.820]  It's still more breadcrumbs leading us lemmings off the cliff, so to speak.
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:28.801]  And how is it that Mueller, again, this guy's, oh, what a great investigation.
[01:53:28.861 --> 01:53:32.022]  All the documents, millions of documents, millions of dollars.
[01:53:32.602 --> 01:53:34.563]  Not once did he contact Julian Assange.
[01:53:35.444 --> 01:53:43.670]  How are you going to claim that you know for a fact Wikileaks is coordinating with Russia and Trump when you've never even talked to Wikileaks?
[01:53:43.891 --> 01:53:45.672]  At least they never published it.
[01:53:45.712 --> 01:53:46.833]  If they did, they never said it.
[01:53:47.133 --> 01:53:48.574]  Assange said he was never contacted.
[01:53:48.594 --> 01:53:53.298]  So how can they make these statements about Wikileaks with no evidence and no questioning of Assange?
[01:53:54.259 --> 01:53:57.381]  Well, they don't want to open up that can of worms because Wikileaks is bulletproof.
[01:53:57.401 --> 01:54:00.964]  Those are cryptographically verified sources.
[01:54:01.565 --> 01:54:05.867]  And it would be a good time for Trump to get on the side of Julian Assange.
[01:54:05.907 --> 01:54:13.830]  He wants to mention WikiLeaks early in his campaign, but now he wants to just be like, oh, I don't, you know... Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, and oh, I just realized it too.
[01:54:14.350 --> 01:54:17.331]  That's another level of the deception here.
[01:54:18.837 --> 01:54:20.598]  It's kind of like what they did with Trump and Putin.
[01:54:21.079 --> 01:54:30.766]  They want to create that wedge in between Trump and Assange so that Trump is afraid to do the right thing with Assange because the media will say, oh see, this is proof of collusion.
[01:54:31.166 --> 01:54:31.547]  Wow.
[01:54:32.387 --> 01:54:32.727]  Wow.
[01:54:32.847 --> 01:54:34.168]  I hope Trump doesn't fall for that.
[01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:40.073]  Real quick, the second part of what I wanted to say was how this is able to continue.
[01:54:40.153 --> 01:54:47.418]  You see, when we were at the Planned Parenthood on Sunday, I started talking about Hillary and how these things come from the top down in the collective consciousness, right?
[01:54:48.686 --> 01:54:55.808]  These leftists can, you know, they get their, I don't know if you're friends with any lefties, but they're on their phone even more than conservatives, like 24-7.
[01:54:56.369 --> 01:54:56.829]  And why?
[01:54:57.369 --> 01:55:04.051]  Because that little dopamine injection that comes from their little validation of their feelings about the orange man, right?
[01:55:04.091 --> 01:55:09.533]  They're like, and so this news, it's just, it's sick and it's all happening.
[01:55:09.893 --> 01:55:13.855]  The conduit is the devices and the social media and the platform.
[01:55:16.556 --> 01:55:17.056]  Well, and look,
[01:55:18.263 --> 01:55:23.064]  Nobody holds CNN accountable for all the fake news that they put out there.
[01:55:23.104 --> 01:55:23.965]  Nobody bans them.
[01:55:24.025 --> 01:55:25.445]  Nobody calls for them to be censored.
[01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:26.705]  They win awards for it.
[01:55:27.406 --> 01:55:29.366]  So that's just the clown world that we live in, Brandon.
[01:55:29.386 --> 01:55:29.966]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:30.366 --> 01:55:33.227]  And thanks for coming out Sunday and supporting us at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:55:33.647 --> 01:55:35.148]  Let's go to Burke in Kansas.
[01:55:35.288 --> 01:55:35.988]  Go ahead, Burke.
[01:55:38.169 --> 01:55:39.069]  Yeah, thanks, Owen.
[01:55:40.029 --> 01:55:42.190]  I think Mueller's just going to disappear.
[01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:43.410]  I really do.
[01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:46.051]  I think we're not going to hear any more out of him.
[01:55:46.744 --> 01:55:49.126]  He's got his own head on the chopping block.
[01:55:49.846 --> 01:55:52.629]  That man's not gonna say any more about anything.
[01:55:52.969 --> 01:55:53.549]  He's done.
[01:55:53.569 --> 01:56:00.655]  And as far as this lady that called in to C-SPAN being loopy, you know, I get it.
[01:56:01.335 --> 01:56:06.559]  I can see, you know, she's fixated on something and she gets... You know, you do.
[01:56:06.639 --> 01:56:07.400]  That's loopy.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:10.382]  You used a great word there because you do.
[01:56:10.462 --> 01:56:13.564]  You get fixated on something and you get loopy about it.
[01:56:14.085 --> 01:56:15.426]  I'm loopy about the wall.
[01:56:16.138 --> 01:56:16.938]  I really am.
[01:56:17.778 --> 01:56:19.039]  It's crazy.
[01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:22.599]  His term is running out, and we're getting nowhere.
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:27.060]  It's getting real bad, and I'm loopy about that.
[01:56:29.381 --> 01:56:30.281]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:56:30.341 --> 01:56:32.341]  We've got 60 seconds left here.
[01:56:34.002 --> 01:56:36.522]  Do you think that if Trump doesn't build a wall, he can't win 2020?
[01:56:36.562 --> 01:56:36.722]  Oh, man.
[01:56:40.956 --> 01:56:42.216]  Does he still have your vote?
[01:56:42.297 --> 01:56:47.598]  I think he's going to win, but I don't think I'm going to vote for him if he doesn't get something going.
[01:56:47.759 --> 01:56:49.219]  I'm not going to vote, period.
[01:56:49.939 --> 01:56:55.201]  He's going to lose my vote, because I really thought he was going to be the man to do it.
[01:56:55.841 --> 01:57:00.323]  Because there's three kinds of people out there, and Trump is one of them.
[01:57:01.984 --> 01:57:07.946]  You make things happen, you wait for things to happen, or you say, what happened?
[01:57:09.531 --> 01:57:18.593]  Well, I almost think that Trump should, like, troll them hardcore and somehow set up some deal for wall construction and contract through Trump International.
[01:57:18.613 --> 01:57:20.714]  I mean, that would be the funniest thing ever.
[01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:21.874]  I wouldn't even be mad.
[01:57:21.914 --> 01:57:22.474]  I wouldn't even care.
[01:57:22.514 --> 01:57:24.195]  I'd watch the media go into hysteria.
[01:57:24.475 --> 01:57:25.555]  Just build the damn wall.
[01:57:25.995 --> 01:57:31.596]  We have an invasion at the southern border, so now people have to build the wall privately to protect their communities.
[01:57:31.656 --> 01:57:37.918]  But, you know, again, that's why we're free market capitalists here, because the private sector always works better than the public sector anyway.
[01:57:38.698 --> 01:57:43.745]  And so there's just more proof of that with a wall going up in New Mexico, but we can't get a wall from our government.
[01:57:44.225 --> 01:57:46.067]  And look, it's not even all Trump's fault.
[01:57:46.128 --> 01:57:48.631]  I mean, he's got judges blocking him, Congress is blocking him.
[01:57:48.671 --> 01:57:50.974]  The Democrats apparently want wide open borders.
[01:57:52.423 --> 01:57:53.063]  Everybody knows.
[01:57:53.603 --> 01:58:03.145]  Sometimes in life, your pipes just get a little clogged up, a little backed up, and you just can't get that clearance and that push that you need.
[01:58:03.765 --> 01:58:10.307]  But with Oxy-Powder from InfoWarsStore.com, that will no longer be an issue.
[01:58:10.627 --> 01:58:14.228]  But watch out, because this stuff is powerful.
[01:58:14.828 --> 01:58:21.089]  Oxy-Powder from InfoWarsStore.com clears those pipes that have been giving you all that backup.
[01:58:23.311 --> 01:58:24.332]  I want them shut down.
[01:58:24.372 --> 01:58:25.293]  I want them silenced.
[01:58:25.333 --> 01:58:26.133]  I want them muted.
[01:58:26.174 --> 01:58:28.015]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:58:28.395 --> 01:58:29.236]  Banning people.
[01:58:29.516 --> 01:58:34.721]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:42.528]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:46.351]  Spreading articles.
[01:58:46.371 --> 01:58:47.171]  Spreading videos.
[01:58:47.212 --> 01:58:47.732]  Spreading links.
[01:58:47.752 --> 01:58:48.553]  You're gonna get demonized.
[01:58:48.573 --> 01:58:49.594]  You're gonna get attacked.
[01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:56.072]  That's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[01:58:56.092 --> 01:58:59.452]  That's really what all this is about.
[01:58:59.752 --> 01:59:10.494]  They say that they deem our content and our brand un... Is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[01:59:10.574 --> 01:59:11.995]  It's about freedom of expression.
[01:59:14.535 --> 01:59:15.195]  I'm a journalist.
[01:59:15.215 --> 01:59:19.276]  I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[01:59:21.613 --> 01:59:48.482]  They can say whatever they think, and I respect their constitutional right to do it, and I hope they respect my cons- If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:56.485 --> 02:00:00.367]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:29.372 --> 02:00:31.673]  Alright, well, I've just received bad news here.
[02:00:33.494 --> 02:00:50.164]  I mean... Man, look... We've had a corrupt government here that's gotten away with a lot of crimes, folks.
[02:00:50.184 --> 02:00:51.705]  A lot of crimes.
[02:00:51.725 --> 02:00:55.727]  A lot of them have been exposed, but you've never had anybody willing to prosecute.
[02:00:57.995 --> 02:00:59.756]  And we thought things would be different under Trump.
[02:01:00.336 --> 02:01:08.982]  We still have our fingers crossed that they would, but this is a sign that they're not.
[02:01:10.122 --> 02:01:13.604]  This was just released from the Justice Department.
[02:01:15.105 --> 02:01:21.609]  Findings of misconduct by an FBI deputy assistant director for unauthorized contact with the media disclosing law enforcement
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:26.603]  And other sensitive information to the media and accepting a gift from the media.
[02:01:26.783 --> 02:01:39.534]  The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation alleging that then FBI Deputy Assistant Director had numerous contacts with members of the media in violation of FBI policy.
[02:01:39.554 --> 02:01:40.915]  That's McCabe.
[02:01:41.555 --> 02:01:47.961]  Additionally, it was alleged that the DAD may have disclosed law enforcement or other sensitive information to the media without authorization.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:02:03.016]  This matter is among the OIG investigations referenced on page 430 of the OIG's review of the allegations regarding various actions by the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in advance of the 2016 election, began in June 2018, before Trump was elected.
[02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:06.720]  The OIG investigation concluded that the DAD engaged in misconduct
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:14.406]  When the DAD disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court in violation of 18 U.S.
[02:02:14.446 --> 02:02:29.058]  Code subsection 401, contempt of court provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization in violation of FBI policy.
[02:02:29.458 --> 02:02:34.242]  The OIG also found that the DAD engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket
[02:02:34.682 --> 02:02:43.304]  Valued at approximately $225 to attend a media-sponsored dinner as a gift from a member of the media in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.
[02:02:43.864 --> 02:02:46.804]  Prosecution of the DAD was declined.
[02:02:48.644 --> 02:02:52.945]  The EOIG has completed this investigation and is providing this report to the FBI for appropriate action.
[02:02:54.045 --> 02:02:54.786]  Which will be nothing.
[02:02:57.266 --> 02:02:58.226]  That's a kick in the nuts.
[02:03:00.107 --> 02:03:02.427]  So you have either McCabe or his assistants
[02:03:03.638 --> 02:03:06.219]  Or whoever else was involved in this, caught breaking the law.
[02:03:07.499 --> 02:03:08.059]  Meets right here.
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.420]  Three different violations.
[02:03:13.021 --> 02:03:14.521]  And prosecution was declined.
[02:03:14.881 --> 02:03:17.762]  And now it's in the FBI's hands, where nothing will happen.
[02:03:22.384 --> 02:03:23.124]  That's a bad sign.
[02:03:25.104 --> 02:03:26.505]  That is a bad sign.
[02:03:30.128 --> 02:03:37.593]  You know, I'm not Wall Loopy, like that last caller was talking about, but I'm Justice Loopy.
[02:03:38.894 --> 02:03:42.757]  If Assange is going to rot in a cell while Hillary Clinton walks free, Trump's a total failure.
[02:03:43.798 --> 02:03:44.018]  Sorry.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:47.201]  He'll do great things for the economy.
[02:03:47.261 --> 02:03:48.682]  Obviously, the numbers are undeniable.
[02:03:48.702 --> 02:03:51.984]  He's done great things for America's morale, great things for the military morale.
[02:03:52.004 --> 02:03:54.386]  There's no doubt Trump is one of the best presidents in modern history.
[02:03:54.466 --> 02:03:55.306]  That's already in the books.
[02:03:56.707 --> 02:04:02.154]  If you have a situation when he leaves office, the science rots in a prison cell while Hillary Clinton walks free, he's a total failure.
[02:04:03.456 --> 02:04:11.546]  Because they'll reverse all of his economic stuff, they'll reverse all the trade deals, they'll reverse all the reverse regulation.
[02:04:11.966 --> 02:04:12.868]  They can reverse all that.
[02:04:14.625 --> 02:04:22.331]  If you don't put people in jail for the open treason that you know they committed, President Trump, you will be derelict of your duty.
[02:04:22.611 --> 02:04:29.597]  And I understand you're one man against an entire system of corruption, but we elected you to be that man, and we need you to be that man now.
[02:04:30.318 --> 02:04:31.719]  And if you have cowards...
[02:04:33.237 --> 02:04:39.598]  ...that are not willing to put these people to justice, you need to get them out.
[02:04:40.118 --> 02:04:43.479]  These are the death throes before the 2020 election.
[02:04:43.679 --> 02:04:45.720]  They're coming for your head, President.
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.680]  They're coming to impeach you.
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.421]  They're coming to impeach you.
[02:04:50.661 --> 02:04:53.121]  You have all of them caught in open treason.
[02:04:53.321 --> 02:04:54.201]  Bring them in!
[02:04:55.402 --> 02:04:56.222]  Bring them in!

[02:06:23.151 --> 02:06:36.178]  You know, it's probably a pipe dream, but boy oh boy, right now is the perfect time for the President to bring these people in.
[02:06:37.150 --> 02:06:42.546]  Totally steal all the wind from out the sails of the Mueller statement today.
[02:06:43.007 --> 02:06:43.288]  Bye.
[02:06:44.568 --> 02:06:50.412]  Declassifying everything, exposing the illegal spying, naming the names, charging them with treason.
[02:06:51.232 --> 02:06:52.313]  Now is literally the perfect time.
[02:06:52.513 --> 02:06:57.136]  You've got all the left drummed up, fired up right now over this total Russian collusion hoax.
[02:06:57.336 --> 02:06:58.317]  We all know it's fake.
[02:06:58.877 --> 02:07:04.380]  Steal all their energy, steal all their momentum, and hit them while they're as high as they could ever be.
[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:05.881]  Bring them back down to earth.
[02:07:06.141 --> 02:07:09.964]  Now is the perfect time to bring these people in for treason.
[02:07:10.604 --> 02:07:12.005]  You have the evidence, President Trump.
[02:07:12.605 --> 02:07:13.326]  Do your job.
[02:07:14.702 --> 02:07:23.888]  Strike while the iron's hot, destroy the morale of the Deep State and their minions and the enemies of this country.
[02:07:26.309 --> 02:07:28.731]  Fortunately, I doubt that's gonna happen today.
[02:07:29.791 --> 02:07:35.455]  I hope it happens in the next year, but how could you help but doubt that too?
[02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:41.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most censored broadcast in the world.
[02:07:43.905 --> 02:07:58.230]  They can't have InfoWars injecting into YouTube and Twitter and Facebook live coverage of breaking news like this because we defeat the mainstream media propaganda.
[02:07:59.810 --> 02:08:00.770]  That's why they censor us.
[02:08:01.771 --> 02:08:05.852]  So, all we have is InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:08:07.369 --> 02:08:08.190]  All we have is you.
[02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:10.231]  We don't have corporate sponsors.
[02:08:10.452 --> 02:08:11.652]  We don't have big ad buys.
[02:08:11.693 --> 02:08:12.994]  We're not allowed on Google Ads.
[02:08:13.494 --> 02:08:14.335]  We get nothing.
[02:08:16.116 --> 02:08:17.317]  But that's okay.
[02:08:17.437 --> 02:08:30.428]  As long as we have you and your support at Infowarsstore.com, we will remain steadfast and even continue to expand in the face of the most censorship you could ever imagine and beyond.

[02:10:00.485 --> 02:10:01.605]  And I want to go back to your calls.
[02:10:01.645 --> 02:10:05.106]  There are some other news I could get to here, but this is the hot topic.
[02:10:05.146 --> 02:10:06.006]  People want to weigh in.
[02:10:06.626 --> 02:10:08.967]  And so we'll go back out to the phone lines.
[02:10:09.247 --> 02:10:11.147]  Let's go to Al calling in from Illinois.
[02:10:11.167 --> 02:10:11.727]  Go ahead, Al.
[02:10:13.268 --> 02:10:14.508]  Hey, what's going on there?
[02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:24.410]  I'm in Chicago, right outside Chicago in Cook County, and people don't really talk about it too much.
[02:10:25.090 --> 02:10:29.751]  They mainly focus on California and New York, but Chicago has probably
[02:10:30.669 --> 02:10:38.409]  One of the higher illegal immigrant populations out here to the point where I mean the hospital wait lines are like five.
[02:10:39.133 --> 02:10:40.674]  Hours, five, eight hours.
[02:10:40.694 --> 02:10:45.417]  You gotta drive out in the middle of nowhere if you have like a kidney stone or emergency or anything.
[02:10:45.917 --> 02:10:52.320]  By the way, there was also 42 people shot in Chicago over the Memorial Day weekend.
[02:10:53.021 --> 02:10:54.402]  A city with very strict gun laws.
[02:10:55.302 --> 02:10:56.363]  I love the city of Chicago.
[02:10:56.403 --> 02:11:00.745]  What a great place, but man, are the politics up there screwy.
[02:11:01.626 --> 02:11:05.668]  Oh, downtown's beautiful, but everything outside of it, though, you're
[02:11:06.141 --> 02:11:08.822]  Pretty much in danger, especially at night.
[02:11:08.902 --> 02:11:16.746]  But anyway, I did want to comment on the Mueller press conference or whatever that was.
[02:11:18.307 --> 02:11:23.709]  I really don't think Mueller knew what he was getting into when he signed up for this.
[02:11:24.230 --> 02:11:31.353]  And when he found out, probably right away, that it was all BS, he was basically
[02:11:31.954 --> 02:11:36.177]  Yeah, I think he's just stalling for time and trying to figure out how he was going to cover his ass at the end of it.
[02:11:37.158 --> 02:11:40.661]  Uh just to make sure that his legacy is okay.
[02:11:40.701 --> 02:11:43.143]  That's why he's saying he doesn't want to testify anymore.
[02:11:43.163 --> 02:11:44.564]  That's my final statement.
[02:11:45.725 --> 02:11:50.009]  He just probably doesn't want to have his legacy be.
[02:11:54.790 --> 02:12:03.353]  Well, I'd like to believe that, but he could have made references to that or insinuated that, and he did nothing of the sort.
[02:12:03.373 --> 02:12:04.493]  He did the exact opposite.
[02:12:05.254 --> 02:12:08.635]  Oh, I'm absolutely sure that he was in with the Democrats, too.
[02:12:10.335 --> 02:12:12.676]  But I'm not defending him at all.
[02:12:13.096 --> 02:12:15.557]  I'm just saying that I think that's what actually happened.
[02:12:16.598 --> 02:12:20.459]  And also, what I wanted to get into is, where's Obama?
[02:12:20.759 --> 02:12:22.299]  You know, he's been silent.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:23.600]  He hasn't been saying anything.
[02:12:24.971 --> 02:12:33.338]  I believe, it's just my opinion, that he's behind the scenes controlling all this, and Comey doesn't care that he's coming out and saying all this stuff.
[02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:34.238]  He knows it's false.
[02:12:34.939 --> 02:12:36.620]  Well, this is actually very complex.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:38.422]  This is actually extremely complex.
[02:12:39.883 --> 02:12:52.793]  There's no doubt, previously, Obama had been pulling a lot of strings, and maybe even after he was out of office and continuing to do such things, because he was pulling the strings from the beginning, making the calls.
[02:12:53.746 --> 02:13:01.612]  It reached a threshold, I couldn't even tell you a time, but it reached a threshold at some point where Obama could no longer do that.
[02:13:02.172 --> 02:13:05.554]  None of them could do that anymore because they knew they were being investigated.
[02:13:06.095 --> 02:13:10.438]  So they could no longer engage with those type of communications to get their stories straight.
[02:13:10.878 --> 02:13:15.942]  And that's why, over time, the stories have kind of, the web of lies has kind of been exposed.
[02:13:16.422 --> 02:13:17.943]  The silence from Obama is deafening.
[02:13:18.284 --> 02:13:21.206]  It really makes you wonder what he knew when he knew it.
[02:13:22.106 --> 02:13:30.092]  But I think right now their communications have been cut off and they really are not able to get a clear message out right now.
[02:13:30.432 --> 02:13:32.534]  And so that's why Obama is totally silent.
[02:13:34.035 --> 02:13:34.875]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:35.096 --> 02:13:42.461]  And I think also he's probably just, you know, maybe even promising like Comey and these people.
[02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:50.927]  I mean, if you if you notice that even on Fox News, the only people they talk about are these seven people at the top, but they're not talking about
[02:13:51.457 --> 02:13:52.238]  Anything else?
[02:13:52.318 --> 02:14:10.412]  You know, Trump's come out on tweets and says Obama knew, and Hillary knew, and all these other people knew, but even Hannity, who is the one that's bitching about this every night about, you know, the fake Russia collusion, he's only going over the five top people.
[02:14:11.124 --> 02:14:19.868]  And I think they're just going to throw these people under the bus, and I don't think anything is going to come out about Obama's involvement or Clinton's involvement.
[02:14:20.188 --> 02:14:24.150]  Well keep in mind too, you have no idea what Obama could be thinking about.
[02:14:24.730 --> 02:14:31.073]  I mean, Trump was such an unknown entity to these people, they really don't even know what was going to happen when he got in office.
[02:14:32.077 --> 02:14:39.698]  So you got to think too, Obama has eight years of crimes that he's got to cover up for now that he's realized Trump is getting in.
[02:14:40.198 --> 02:14:41.999]  He would have never had to do that without Hillary.
[02:14:42.279 --> 02:14:48.300]  So he's got to spy on Trump and he's got to engage in this coup because Trump's a non-entity.
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:48.840]  They don't know.
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:50.660]  Is Trump going to come in and really look for this treason?
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:52.281]  Is Trump going to come in and declassify this stuff?
[02:14:52.301 --> 02:14:53.461]  Is he going to look into the Iran deal?
[02:14:53.481 --> 02:14:54.181]  Is he going to look into this?
[02:14:54.201 --> 02:14:55.101]  Is he going to look into that?
[02:14:55.961 --> 02:14:58.982]  So they're like hitting the panic button on all these different fronts.
[02:14:59.966 --> 02:15:14.953]  And we're just all focused on Russian collusion because that's the distraction that they decided to run with, but it really is amazing how Obama has managed to just say nothing throughout this, and the media just allows him to be totally silent.
[02:15:15.413 --> 02:15:22.656]  That's stunning to me, because they're going to be so angry when they finally learn that Mueller's not going to testify before Congress.
[02:15:23.136 --> 02:15:24.757]  When are they going to start coming after Obama?
[02:15:24.837 --> 02:15:26.698]  When are they going to start looking at Obama for answers?
[02:15:26.838 --> 02:15:28.719]  When are they going to start looking at Obama for statements?
[02:15:29.944 --> 02:15:37.329]  And Obama's sitting back, I think totally foggy right now, wondering what he can say without entrapping himself.
[02:15:38.370 --> 02:15:39.330]  Because you've already seen...
[02:15:40.373 --> 02:15:42.095]  Brennan threw Obama under the bus.
[02:15:42.595 --> 02:15:44.597]  Clapper threw Obama under the bus.
[02:15:45.177 --> 02:15:46.419]  It all started with Obama.
[02:15:46.759 --> 02:15:49.241]  All the illegal spying started with Obama.
[02:15:49.622 --> 02:15:59.210]  Now we'll start to get all the strings attached with the declassification of the FISA applications and warrants, but Obama knows he was at the top of it.
[02:15:59.290 --> 02:15:59.891]  They all know it.
[02:16:00.251 --> 02:16:00.752]  He's guilty.
[02:16:02.864 --> 02:16:06.807]  The Global Controllers are very smart in some ways, very ignorant in others.
[02:16:07.588 --> 02:16:09.349]  But they understand the power of archetypes.
[02:16:10.590 --> 02:16:18.316]  And I never knew when I started out on my quest 25 years ago to restore the American Republic that I would end up being a major leader in it.
[02:16:18.917 --> 02:16:24.621]  I just simply thought I'd be one more voice calling on the people to stand up and get involved in their own destinies.
[02:16:26.482 --> 02:16:27.203]  But it became clear
[02:16:28.857 --> 02:16:35.522]  Eight, nine years ago, even in Newsweek and Time Magazine, they said, Alex Jones is the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[02:16:36.023 --> 02:16:40.126]  In the wilderness, he must be stopped.
[02:16:40.186 --> 02:16:45.751]  And all these years later, I realized that I didn't invent the ideas I'm promoting.
[02:16:46.892 --> 02:16:55.419]  I'm simply promoting free market, renaissance, Americana, and ideas that are
[02:16:57.057 --> 02:17:03.261]  Diametrically opposed to authoritarian systems, whether they be fascist, communist, or socialist.
[02:17:05.643 --> 02:17:14.549]  But nevertheless, Infowars has been chosen by the enemy as the symbol of Americana, as the card.
[02:17:15.690 --> 02:17:24.015]  And if they can demonize it, if they can lie about it, and if they can destroy it, they believe they can demoralize you and make you give up.
[02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:24.896]  So,
[02:17:26.001 --> 02:17:28.343]  Please hold InfoWars up.
[02:17:28.984 --> 02:17:29.745]  Please promote it.
[02:17:29.825 --> 02:17:30.545]  Please support it.
[02:17:31.386 --> 02:17:34.029]  I personally hope that we can survive this.
[02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:36.151]  But even if we don't...
[02:17:37.352 --> 02:17:47.594]  Don't think a defeat of an individual or an organization is an expression of who you are, because you are the listeners and viewers that actually made InfoWars the success it is.
[02:17:48.254 --> 02:17:59.037]  Yes, I selfishly want to continue on with the future, but I don't want you to ever think that if I'm set up, killed, destroyed, imprisoned, lied about with their fake narratives,
[02:18:00.285 --> 02:18:00.986]  That we're losers.
[02:18:01.847 --> 02:18:04.369]  We did the right thing and told the truth and we've already changed the world.
[02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:06.792]  So you need to continue on.
[02:18:07.613 --> 02:18:08.734]  But we're at that fork in the road.
[02:18:08.754 --> 02:18:13.719]  Will Infowars continue on to fight more battles and win more battles thanks to your support?
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:15.601]  Or will we be destroyed?
[02:18:16.142 --> 02:18:18.605]  And then you have to move on and not be demoralized.
[02:18:19.225 --> 02:18:19.846]  We're at that point.
[02:18:21.334 --> 02:18:21.994]  It's financial.
[02:18:22.475 --> 02:18:25.416]  At the end of the day, money talks, BS walks.
[02:18:26.156 --> 02:18:30.398]  Funding allows us to operate and expand and defeat the enemy.
[02:18:31.118 --> 02:18:33.859]  Not having money shuts us down and we're defeated.
[02:18:33.879 --> 02:18:36.981]  And once we've been silenced, the enemy can lie about us all they want.
[02:18:37.701 --> 02:18:41.042]  We're running Memorial Day specials right through next week.
[02:18:41.703 --> 02:18:43.063]  Some of the biggest sales we've ever done.

[02:19:21.939 --> 02:19:25.143]  Whatever you do, commit now like you've already done.
[02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:32.114]  To take action, whether it's word of mouth, or praying for us, or buying the products, or all three, you've already changed the world.
[02:19:32.574 --> 02:19:47.001]  And I humbly come to you with respect and thank you again for what you've done for myself, for my children, and for your children, and for all of our own destinies, because this is an incredible time in humanity at that fork in the road, or at that crossroads.
[02:19:47.621 --> 02:19:48.262]  But whatever you do,
[02:19:49.062 --> 02:19:50.183]  Never give in to the globalist.
[02:19:50.703 --> 02:19:52.064]  Never give in to your humanity.
[02:19:52.465 --> 02:19:53.806]  Never believe you're a piece of crap.
[02:19:54.306 --> 02:19:55.747]  Never believe that humanity sucks.
[02:19:56.227 --> 02:19:59.170]  Because that is a lie of the old serpent, Satan.
[02:20:06.375 --> 02:20:08.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:32.369 --> 02:20:33.391]  What a time to be alive.
[02:20:35.895 --> 02:20:39.100]  If Donald Trump doesn't drain the deep state, folks, we're done.
[02:20:40.903 --> 02:20:41.344]  We're done.
[02:20:43.109 --> 02:20:46.351]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the most censored broadcast in the world.
[02:20:46.571 --> 02:20:50.033]  If it wasn't for your support at InfoWarsTore.com, we wouldn't even be on air here today.
[02:20:50.213 --> 02:20:57.898]  Please tell your friends and family about what's happening with us and the censorship, and please continue to support us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:58.018 --> 02:21:03.141]  Alex has some plans for the future here, but it's tough with the censorship and
[02:21:04.554 --> 02:21:10.297]  That stops us from expanding our reach by not being able to get on YouTube and Facebook and all the super media highways.
[02:21:10.938 --> 02:21:14.500]  So we're just contracted here to Infowars.com slash show, but thanks to your support.
[02:21:15.339 --> 02:21:18.562]  We manage and we remain steadfast.
[02:21:19.162 --> 02:21:22.886]  Don't forget about the Memorial Day specials coming to an end soon.
[02:21:23.086 --> 02:21:30.753]  Take advantage of all the deep discounts on all the supplements and everything at InfoWarsTore.com today before the Memorial Day special ends.
[02:21:31.453 --> 02:21:36.237]  So final hours of the massive sales at InfoWarsTore.com for Memorial Day.
[02:21:36.618 --> 02:21:41.122]  And we thank everybody that supports us at InfoWarsTore.com for keeping us on air.
[02:21:42.574 --> 02:21:44.334]  Alright, I'm just going to keep going down the phone calls.
[02:21:44.414 --> 02:21:45.234]  It's the hot topic.
[02:21:45.315 --> 02:21:46.355]  Everybody wants to talk about it.
[02:21:46.375 --> 02:21:47.355]  The lines are still lit up.
[02:21:48.075 --> 02:21:49.175]  I do have some other news to get to.
[02:21:49.215 --> 02:21:52.136]  Maybe I'll pepper it in at some point, but let's just stick to the phone lines.
[02:21:52.296 --> 02:21:57.537]  In fact, we've got a caller calling in from Ireland who wanted to comment on what we've been discussing today.
[02:21:57.597 --> 02:21:58.797]  Patrick calling in from Ireland.
[02:21:58.877 --> 02:21:59.277]  Go ahead.
[02:22:00.697 --> 02:22:01.457]  Hi, how are you?
[02:22:02.058 --> 02:22:02.758]  Good, thanks for calling.
[02:22:02.778 --> 02:22:03.298]  Can you hear me?
[02:22:03.318 --> 02:22:03.498]  Yep.
[02:22:03.898 --> 02:22:06.919]  Can you hear me?
[02:22:06.939 --> 02:22:07.079]  Yes.
[02:22:07.219 --> 02:22:09.299]  I just wanted to say here, Ireland-wise, we're
[02:22:10.174 --> 02:22:12.735]  We've nothing but just Democrat news, nothing.
[02:22:13.076 --> 02:22:15.277]  So you really are lucky in America to have Infowars.
[02:22:16.597 --> 02:22:23.061]  I can only get it now a day late because YouTube have obviously blocked us, but I can get it still on YouTube, but it's a day late.
[02:22:23.081 --> 02:22:25.382]  Can you hear me?
[02:22:25.842 --> 02:22:27.884]  Yep.
[02:22:28.244 --> 02:22:32.226]  Just as regards, it's interesting here, right, the media
[02:22:33.414 --> 02:22:42.321]  Here, for about a year after Trump got elected, they did hatchet job after hatchet job every single day.
[02:22:42.361 --> 02:22:45.544]  You switch channels from every one leftist crowd to another.
[02:22:45.564 --> 02:22:54.912]  They were non-stop, constant, lies, lies, lies, doing psychological analysis on him and everything, having all these professors in, constant.
[02:22:55.432 --> 02:22:59.255]  Now they've gone silent at the moment, and there's not a dickie board out of them about Pelosi.
[02:23:00.356 --> 02:23:01.217]  We're good to go.
[02:23:19.128 --> 02:23:24.250]  A house divided cannot stand, and you are divided, and I believe you will.
[02:23:24.370 --> 02:23:26.991]  You will go into civil war, and it's going to be a bloodbath.
[02:23:27.731 --> 02:23:33.253]  But the deep state will trigger it with some massive event like taking out your financial heart, maybe like New York.
[02:23:34.393 --> 02:23:34.613]  Why?
[02:23:34.633 --> 02:23:38.934]  I believe God has left you because of the abortion.
[02:23:39.374 --> 02:23:40.655]  You're no longer protected by God.
[02:23:43.697 --> 02:23:44.658]  Well, it's all interesting.
[02:23:44.678 --> 02:23:48.660]  There's no doubt that things are on a razor's edge right now.
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.401]  I hope we can avoid a civil war.
[02:23:50.421 --> 02:23:53.604]  I hope that we can stop murdering our children.
[02:23:54.844 --> 02:24:00.288]  You know, but we're clearly seeing what the Democrats are trying to do right now.
[02:24:00.308 --> 02:24:01.769]  They are trying to divide the House.
[02:24:01.889 --> 02:24:02.690]  They want it to fall.
[02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:07.673]  I mean, I just look at every character and I just go, these are total evil people.
[02:24:07.693 --> 02:24:08.654]  Who the hell votes for them?
[02:24:09.194 --> 02:24:09.854]  You just look at them.
[02:24:09.894 --> 02:24:11.976]  But then I see the same thing happening in my country.
[02:24:12.811 --> 02:24:19.795]  The same demons from hell representing us who just hoodwinked the Irish people into voting for murdering our children.
[02:24:19.995 --> 02:24:21.015]  And we've got to pay for it.
[02:24:21.976 --> 02:24:22.236]  You know?
[02:24:22.396 --> 02:24:26.598]  And we've been told if someone else comes in from outside, we have to pay for their abortions as well.
[02:24:27.478 --> 02:24:32.621]  And meanwhile they're stuffing in military aid in hotels all over our country.
[02:24:34.994 --> 02:24:39.216]  Well, the good news is Europe is seeing nationalism rising.
[02:24:39.957 --> 02:24:42.598]  Maybe that reaches Ireland, maybe not.
[02:24:42.638 --> 02:24:49.321]  I don't know how politicized things are in Ireland right now, but... Unfortunately, I'm only seeing what I'm seeing.
[02:24:49.341 --> 02:25:00.087]  Most of the Irish people are politically pretty... This green thing has taken up, which is a false thing, as we all know, but the youth seem to be carried away with this green thing here in Ireland.
[02:25:01.977 --> 02:25:05.178]  Yeah, it's all about, you know, the fake man-made global warming narrative.
[02:25:05.218 --> 02:25:07.019]  Thanks so much for the call, Patrick.
[02:25:07.459 --> 02:25:08.500]  He just dropped abruptly.
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:09.620]  He was calling in from Ireland.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:11.521]  It was great to hear from him.
[02:25:12.181 --> 02:25:14.302]  Let's go to Joe, calling in from West Virginia.
[02:25:14.322 --> 02:25:15.142]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:25:15.162 --> 02:25:19.064]  I'm going to call in and talk about... Can you hear me?
[02:25:19.284 --> 02:25:19.824]  Yep, go ahead.
[02:25:20.624 --> 02:25:27.427]  Okay, I just want to talk about what Mueller said, and I think they're going to subpoena Mueller and force him to testify.
[02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:28.651]  Who's that?
[02:25:28.751 --> 02:25:30.032]  The Democrats?
[02:25:30.412 --> 02:25:31.933]  Or the Republicans?
[02:25:32.073 --> 02:25:34.795]  Congress is going to force him to testify.
[02:25:36.456 --> 02:25:37.656]  The Democrats won't.
[02:25:39.117 --> 02:25:40.318]  I don't think the Democrats will.
[02:25:40.418 --> 02:25:41.699]  The Republicans might.
[02:25:41.819 --> 02:25:42.960]  I don't think the Democrats will.
[02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:46.982]  I don't know.
[02:25:47.022 --> 02:25:53.966]  I think the Democrats will move to have him testify and then move to impeach Trump.
[02:25:55.182 --> 02:25:56.923]  Well, they're already trying to get Trump impeached.
[02:25:56.943 --> 02:25:57.964]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:25:58.805 --> 02:26:00.946]  Mueller said he doesn't want to testify in front of Congress.
[02:26:00.966 --> 02:26:01.626]  He said he's done.
[02:26:01.646 --> 02:26:05.549]  I'd be shocked if the Democrats go against him on that.
[02:26:05.609 --> 02:26:06.530]  It'll blow up in their face.
[02:26:06.570 --> 02:26:09.032]  But hey, that's how everything seems to be working.
[02:26:09.092 --> 02:26:10.352]  So maybe that is the destiny.
[02:26:12.874 --> 02:26:16.176]  That might be.
[02:26:16.317 --> 02:26:19.579]  I mean, can I give a shout out to where I'm listening in from?
[02:26:19.599 --> 02:26:20.079]  Where's that?
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:21.140]  Yeah.
[02:26:22.321 --> 02:26:22.521]  Yeah.
[02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:25.055]  Listen to InfoWars on Cloud TV.
[02:26:27.716 --> 02:26:29.236]  It's $58.99 a year.
[02:26:33.598 --> 02:26:39.941]  And you can listen to RT and One American News Network all on Cloud TV.
[02:26:40.221 --> 02:26:40.941]  Cloud TV.
[02:26:41.061 --> 02:26:44.922]  Yeah, one of the great carriers of the Alex Jones Show and the InfoWars broadcast.
[02:26:44.963 --> 02:26:46.923]  Thank you so much for calling in today, Joe.
[02:26:47.323 --> 02:26:49.824]  Let's go to Donnie calling in from Phoenix.
[02:26:50.225 --> 02:26:50.965]  Go ahead, Donnie.
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:59.562]  You're on a speakerphone, I can barely hear you.
[02:27:01.363 --> 02:27:10.686]  I was just calling in about, uh, I got stickers on the back of my truck, a bunch of InfoWars stickers, and it keeps your coughs off my tail.
[02:27:13.446 --> 02:27:18.148]  In the frankincense, that's a great deal from the store as opposed to
[02:27:19.033 --> 02:27:20.394]  It's like 30 bucks.
[02:27:20.794 --> 02:27:23.535]  Yeah, we've got a bunch of, the Emerts Essentials oils are great.
[02:27:23.576 --> 02:27:24.736]  The frankincense is great.
[02:27:24.876 --> 02:27:26.177]  The eucalyptus is great.
[02:27:26.277 --> 02:27:27.037]  It's cheap, too.
[02:27:28.658 --> 02:27:31.300]  Sunscreen and bug spray, highly recommended out here.
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:32.000]  I'm a pool guy.
[02:27:33.101 --> 02:27:35.182]  But I was going to say, I was listening to Mueller.
[02:27:35.202 --> 02:27:39.404]  He's got a pretty good ear, and he sounds really broken and scared.
[02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:43.906]  And I think, I think he's pretty much toast.
[02:27:44.567 --> 02:27:47.208]  He's going to be drinking pretty hard tonight, I would guess.
[02:27:49.336 --> 02:27:50.637]  Anyways, that's my input.
[02:27:50.657 --> 02:27:51.397]  I got a pretty good ear.
[02:27:51.417 --> 02:27:53.758]  I've been playing rock and roll for a long time.
[02:27:54.578 --> 02:27:56.259]  I know what broken people sound like.
[02:27:57.159 --> 02:27:57.439]  You know?
[02:27:58.099 --> 02:27:58.900]  So broken how?
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:01.701]  I mean, what do you think has him broken?
[02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:05.902]  Well, the way he retired and everything.
[02:28:05.922 --> 02:28:09.563]  So like his reputation is ruined?
[02:28:09.643 --> 02:28:11.644]  Or he's going to be exposed for crimes?
[02:28:11.704 --> 02:28:12.024]  Or what?
[02:28:14.545 --> 02:28:15.886]  Uh, yeah.
[02:28:16.166 --> 02:28:16.626]  Obviously.
[02:28:17.355 --> 02:28:19.257]  He's worried about going to prison, I would say.
[02:28:19.297 --> 02:28:20.678]  I mean, his reputation's shot.
[02:28:20.698 --> 02:28:22.059]  That's why he quit.
[02:28:22.839 --> 02:28:24.741]  Maybe that's the only thing he could think of to do.
[02:28:25.622 --> 02:28:26.963]  Maybe to salvage his reputation.
[02:28:27.003 --> 02:28:33.828]  Well, I'm not sure what would land him in prison as far as this special counsel investigation is concerned, but who knows?
[02:28:33.868 --> 02:28:40.754]  Maybe there's some other stuff with the Epstein files being reopened that he may be afraid of there.
[02:28:41.054 --> 02:28:41.894]  Thanks for the call, Donnie.
[02:28:41.914 --> 02:28:42.935]  Alright, here's the deal.
[02:28:43.055 --> 02:28:44.717]  I've got so many callers to get to.
[02:28:46.305 --> 02:28:50.887]  The fourth hour host today is Mike Adams.
[02:28:50.967 --> 02:28:52.288]  Maybe he'll take more of your calls.
[02:28:53.288 --> 02:28:54.929]  I do have other news to get to.
[02:28:54.949 --> 02:28:57.430]  I may not get to it.
[02:28:57.450 --> 02:28:58.651]  We may just keep taking your calls.
[02:28:59.231 --> 02:28:59.831]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:59.851 --> 02:29:00.872]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:02.916 --> 02:29:08.440]  Months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:12.743]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[02:29:13.203 --> 02:29:15.405]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[02:29:15.425 --> 02:29:17.566]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[02:29:17.907 --> 02:29:19.908]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[02:29:20.428 --> 02:29:20.688]  Boom!
[02:29:20.969 --> 02:29:23.210]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:25.131]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[02:29:25.191 --> 02:29:26.993]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[02:29:27.053 --> 02:29:28.173]  You still have a shopfront.
[02:29:28.374 --> 02:29:29.174]  And then what do we see?
[02:29:29.454 --> 02:29:30.195]  Washington Post.
[02:29:30.735 --> 02:29:33.877]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[02:29:35.238 --> 02:29:38.360]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:41.222]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[02:29:41.522 --> 02:29:46.925]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:47.225 --> 02:29:51.748]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is.
[02:29:52.108 --> 02:29:57.971]  To fund these de-platforming campaigns, we're not funded by Gulf State dictatorships like CNN is.
[02:29:58.211 --> 02:30:01.792]  We're only funded by you, by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:04.753]  They've not shut down our speech!
[02:30:04.793 --> 02:30:09.795]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[02:30:10.056 --> 02:30:17.219]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[02:30:17.559 --> 02:30:18.359]  Are you coming back?
[02:30:18.899 --> 02:30:20.020]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.942]  We're at newswars.com.
[02:30:22.002 --> 02:30:24.205]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news.
[02:30:24.225 --> 02:30:25.987]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[02:30:26.247 --> 02:30:30.773]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[02:30:31.013 --> 02:30:33.256]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:30:33.276 --> 02:30:36.279]  InfoWars.com, man!
[02:30:36.540 --> 02:30:36.900]  Woo!
[02:30:39.605 --> 02:30:42.348]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[02:30:42.368 --> 02:30:43.770]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:46.813]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:30:47.313 --> 02:30:49.115]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[02:30:49.135 --> 02:30:52.639]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[02:30:52.659 --> 02:30:55.322]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[02:30:55.402 --> 02:30:57.644]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:30:57.684 --> 02:30:58.445]  That's where they find it.
[02:30:58.665 --> 02:30:59.967]  You know, there's what they call websites.
[02:31:00.667 --> 02:31:01.088]  Just go there.
[02:31:05.305 --> 02:31:09.208]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:31:09.528 --> 02:31:10.669]  I am now completely banned.
[02:31:10.729 --> 02:31:14.712]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[02:31:15.012 --> 02:31:16.033]  I want them shut down.
[02:31:16.093 --> 02:31:17.014]  I want them silenced.
[02:31:17.054 --> 02:31:17.754]  I want them muted.
[02:31:17.774 --> 02:31:19.716]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:31:19.776 --> 02:31:21.277]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:31:21.657 --> 02:31:27.500]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:34.523]  These are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[02:31:34.583 --> 02:31:38.324]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[02:31:38.625 --> 02:31:41.766]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:31:41.946 --> 02:31:44.127]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[02:31:44.247 --> 02:31:46.549]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[02:32:03.439 --> 02:32:07.763]  No, because Big Tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[02:32:07.783 --> 02:32:09.104]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[02:32:09.164 --> 02:32:12.326]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[02:32:12.447 --> 02:32:14.989]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice.
[02:32:15.109 --> 02:32:17.471]  And a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver.
[02:32:17.531 --> 02:32:21.594]  Social media's hall monitor, Brian Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[02:32:21.634 --> 02:32:24.797]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[02:32:24.977 --> 02:32:27.258]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency.
[02:32:27.898 --> 02:32:34.420]  I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[02:32:34.780 --> 02:32:36.980]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:39.841]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[02:32:40.121 --> 02:32:41.141]  I want them shut down.
[02:32:41.221 --> 02:32:42.122]  I want them silenced.
[02:32:42.182 --> 02:32:42.962]  I want them muted.
[02:32:43.002 --> 02:32:44.842]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:32:44.943 --> 02:32:46.303]  I want them shut down.
[02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:47.843]  I want them silenced.
[02:32:47.863 --> 02:32:48.684]  I want them muted.
[02:32:48.884 --> 02:32:49.824]  Don't worry.
[02:32:50.404 --> 02:32:52.104]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:32:57.079 --> 02:33:00.805]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:33:06.333 --> 02:33:08.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.307 --> 02:33:21.690]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:24.951]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:26.012 --> 02:33:30.414]  There's so much going on, but the hot topic is the Mueller statement today.
[02:33:30.434 --> 02:33:31.814]  We've been taking your calls on it.
[02:33:31.854 --> 02:33:33.015]  We will continue to do so.
[02:33:33.515 --> 02:33:38.918]  Folks, don't forget, InfoWarsStore.com has massive Memorial Day specials happening right now.
[02:33:39.798 --> 02:33:50.225]  Deep discounts up to 60% off some InfoWars life supplements like Xtend-A-Wise, 50% off top-selling supplements like Bodies and Super Mill Vitality, and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:33:51.045 --> 02:33:53.027]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:53.047 --> 02:33:54.988]  The brand new 8-pack Power Stack.
[02:33:55.108 --> 02:33:59.151]  If you're curious about supplements or starting it, that is the best way to do it.
[02:33:59.451 --> 02:34:06.476]  We have pre-packaged morning and evening time supplement routine packs ready to go.
[02:34:07.336 --> 02:34:13.120]  Other competitors would sell for at least $200 a supplement package like this.
[02:34:13.561 --> 02:34:16.603]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com, it's $60.
[02:34:17.904 --> 02:34:20.105]  You cannot beat that deal.
[02:34:20.766 --> 02:34:24.629]  And again, your support at InfoWarsStore.com makes everything we do here possible.
[02:34:24.649 --> 02:34:26.170]  We want to continue to expand.
[02:34:26.470 --> 02:34:31.374]  They're trying to make that impossible by censoring us off all social media so we can't reach new audiences.
[02:34:31.734 --> 02:34:34.036]  So we need you to tell friends and family about the broadcast.
[02:34:34.796 --> 02:34:38.479]  And to shop at InfowarsStore.com, but we make it easy on you.
[02:34:39.359 --> 02:34:40.360]  We have stuff that you need.
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:48.305]  Toothpaste, shampoo, body wash, bug lotion, bug spray, water filters, air filters.
[02:34:48.345 --> 02:34:51.007]  If you're not filtering the water at your house, you're nuts.
[02:34:52.273 --> 02:34:58.795]  Another story, in fact, I think it was Bernie Sanders just put out a story about how water in South Carolina is totally polluted.
[02:34:59.295 --> 02:35:00.376]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:35:00.476 --> 02:35:04.197]  That's why we sell water filters, so you don't have to drink the polluted water.
[02:35:04.757 --> 02:35:07.958]  So, if you're not filtering your water, you're crazy.
[02:35:08.058 --> 02:35:09.899]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, take advantage.
[02:35:09.939 --> 02:35:11.979]  We have all kinds of different water filters for you.
[02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:13.340]  In fact, I believe the
[02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:20.817]  ProPure water system is on sale right now, so one of our top-selling water filtration systems is on sale.
[02:35:20.837 --> 02:35:25.781]  But we've got all kinds of different water filters available for you at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:26.661 --> 02:35:37.250]  Again, take advantage of the Memorial Day sales, the final hours, final hours of our Memorial Day sales right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:37.970 --> 02:35:40.452]  Okay, let's continue on with the phone calls.
[02:35:40.753 --> 02:35:42.714]  Mike in Texas.
[02:35:42.894 --> 02:35:43.495]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:48.831]  Greetings from a Creepcore Parkway Central alum.
[02:35:48.851 --> 02:35:50.372]  Hello.
[02:35:51.572 --> 02:35:56.434]  There are several reasons why Jeremy in California is wrong.
[02:35:56.454 --> 02:36:06.298]  Number one, the Justice Department relied on a regulation to launch their investigation, but they never had a predicate crime.
[02:36:06.318 --> 02:36:11.100]  Instead, they launched it as a counterintel investigation to use foreign assets
[02:36:12.041 --> 02:36:14.341]  Because they couldn't surveil a U.S.
[02:36:14.361 --> 02:36:14.802]  citizen.
[02:36:14.822 --> 02:36:17.462]  The CIA isn't allowed to do that.
[02:36:17.482 --> 02:36:20.003]  As far as I know, the FBI isn't allowed to do it either.
[02:36:21.343 --> 02:36:33.265]  Number two, Trump would have to have a so-called mens rea, a state of mind where he knew he was guilty and was therefore trying to defeat the investigation.
[02:36:34.285 --> 02:36:38.466]  Clearly, no one in the world knew that he was innocent more than Donald Trump.
[02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:45.192]  So for a couple reasons, there's no way they're going to try to charge him with obstruction.
[02:36:45.212 --> 02:36:47.792]  That's just absurd.
[02:36:49.593 --> 02:36:49.893]  Right.
[02:36:50.613 --> 02:36:53.614]  And the real obstruction was done by them.
[02:36:54.814 --> 02:37:00.056]  They're the ones that don't want the declassification of all these files and the FISA warrants.
[02:37:01.056 --> 02:37:03.437]  While they call for total declassification of whatever they want.
[02:37:04.778 --> 02:37:08.381]  Yeah, and by the way, the Deputy Assistant Director is not McCabe.
[02:37:09.222 --> 02:37:14.626]  I don't know if he reported to McCabe, but that's another position altogether.
[02:37:14.646 --> 02:37:17.728]  Yeah, I think it was either Dan Coats or someone else.
[02:37:17.788 --> 02:37:19.730]  I can't remember, but it was his department.
[02:37:22.011 --> 02:37:25.995]  Yeah, but McCabe's going down on perjury charges, if nothing else.
[02:37:27.596 --> 02:37:30.778]  I mean, Trump has all these guys five ways to Sunday.
[02:37:31.199 --> 02:37:33.000]  It's just, does William Barr want to prosecute?
[02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:33.921]  It's really what it comes down to.
[02:37:35.575 --> 02:37:36.135]  Alright, thanks Owen.
[02:37:55.169 --> 02:37:55.929]  Owen, how you doing, man?
[02:37:55.949 --> 02:37:56.909]  Good, thanks for calling.
[02:37:57.550 --> 02:37:59.830]  Hey, that last caller sort of hit what I was going to tell you.
[02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:02.151]  You know that IG report that just came out?
[02:38:02.351 --> 02:38:05.391]  I didn't really want to talk about this, but you brought it up because you were upset with it.
[02:38:06.111 --> 02:38:08.432]  But, you know, the IG is just like Mueller.
[02:38:09.332 --> 02:38:10.892]  He doesn't prosecute anything.
[02:38:11.913 --> 02:38:13.273]  He has to give it to Barr.
[02:38:14.233 --> 02:38:15.594]  Barr makes the decision.
[02:38:15.934 --> 02:38:18.274]  That report that you just read was the IG report.
[02:38:18.354 --> 02:38:20.014]  He's deciding not to prosecute.
[02:38:20.555 --> 02:38:21.435]  It's not his decision.
[02:38:21.715 --> 02:38:22.135]  It's Barr's.
[02:38:25.618 --> 02:38:31.739]  Yes, but it's worded like, yeah, we're just going to pass on further charges here.
[02:38:31.839 --> 02:38:33.320]  But that's not his call.
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:38.901]  That's all I wanted to tell you about that, because I know you were really ticked off about that one.
[02:38:39.241 --> 02:38:43.622]  But with Mueller, Mueller has nothing to do but to double down.
[02:38:43.902 --> 02:38:45.342]  You know, he's a liar.
[02:38:45.982 --> 02:38:48.223]  Everything he said was a lie in his speech.
[02:38:49.643 --> 02:38:51.523]  You know, it was totally debunked.
[02:38:52.744 --> 02:38:54.664]  And he has to double down on it because of what?
[02:38:55.842 --> 02:38:59.826]  President Trump declassified all the documents.
[02:39:00.286 --> 02:39:07.893]  And like you guys have talked on the show, you know, why did he include the Secretary of Defense?
[02:39:07.953 --> 02:39:10.616]  Why did he include the Secretary of Commerce?
[02:39:11.397 --> 02:39:14.980]  Because they're releasing the documents on Uranium One.
[02:39:16.541 --> 02:39:17.703]  And where does Mueller fit in?
[02:39:18.103 --> 02:39:18.964]  Uranium One.
[02:39:19.411 --> 02:39:23.499]  Yeah, I forgot about that, too, with Mueller's ties to Uranium One and the Epstein files.
[02:39:23.539 --> 02:39:25.964]  He has to double down, dude, because he's going down.
[02:39:26.905 --> 02:39:28.128]  And he knows he's going down.
[02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:29.953]  That's why he's not going to invest.
[02:39:30.253 --> 02:39:41.783]  He's not going to testify because they don't want him to testify that, oh yeah, I knew the whole thing was a joke the day I took the office of the inspector, whatever he was.
[02:39:42.104 --> 02:39:43.785]  Yeah, Mueller's corrupt as the day is long.
[02:39:43.985 --> 02:39:50.010]  Around 9-11, Uranium One, Epstein files, and now the Russian collusion.
[02:39:52.112 --> 02:40:01.026]  And that's why he came up and did that, because he just told everybody, I'm not coming to Congress, you can impeach, you can do whatever you want, but I'm not testifying, because he's in deep water.
[02:40:01.326 --> 02:40:03.870]  Well that's going to be really interesting to see what happens with that, because
[02:40:04.964 --> 02:40:08.406]  I mean, the Democrat constituencies want him to testify.
[02:40:09.027 --> 02:40:14.210]  We want the Republicans in the intel committees to ask him questions during testimony.
[02:40:14.730 --> 02:40:15.691]  It's just wild, man.
[02:40:15.711 --> 02:40:16.131]  I mean, what?
[02:40:16.291 --> 02:40:17.312]  Just unbelievable.
[02:40:17.412 --> 02:40:18.072]  Yeah, I forgot.
[02:40:18.112 --> 02:40:19.233]  He was part of the Anthrax.
[02:40:19.253 --> 02:40:20.954]  He was part of the Enron.
[02:40:21.034 --> 02:40:22.495]  Yeah, Mueller's corrupt as the day is long.
[02:40:22.675 --> 02:40:23.495]  Thanks for the call, Gene.
[02:40:23.715 --> 02:40:25.076]  Let's go to Jefferson in Virginia.
[02:40:25.116 --> 02:40:25.897]  Go ahead, Jefferson.
[02:40:27.958 --> 02:40:28.298]  Hey, Owen.
[02:40:28.338 --> 02:40:28.779]  How's it going?
[02:40:29.359 --> 02:40:29.519]  Good.
[02:40:31.567 --> 02:40:38.753]  I wanted to say much that they were saying earlier that AG Barr is the guy that makes the decision on prosecuting and that's a good thing.
[02:40:38.793 --> 02:40:39.914]  I think he's still on our side.
[02:40:41.416 --> 02:40:54.607]  When it comes to this Mueller announcement today, he admitted essentially that he used fake manufactured evidence to get the indictment against the Russian military guys for supposedly hacking the DNC.
[02:40:54.907 --> 02:40:58.230]  That had to be manufactured fake evidence that he used in that grand jury.
[02:40:58.911 --> 02:41:00.352]  So he's guilty of a crime right there.
[02:41:00.692 --> 02:41:01.693]  But yeah, no, no, hold on.
[02:41:01.713 --> 02:41:03.554]  Let's actually, let's actually bear down on that for a second.
[02:41:03.574 --> 02:41:04.394]  I forgot about this.
[02:41:04.995 --> 02:41:07.356]  The DNC never even turned their servers over.
[02:41:07.736 --> 02:41:13.039]  So not only did he never question Assange, when did they ever investigate the actual servers?
[02:41:15.161 --> 02:41:15.441]  Correct.
[02:41:16.521 --> 02:41:21.464]  And I'm not sure how William Binney got the metadata, but he proved that it couldn't be downloaded that fast.
[02:41:22.245 --> 02:41:22.425]  So...
[02:41:23.268 --> 02:41:29.049]  It has to be fake evidence that he used in the grand jury to get around that problem, and he never brought up the download times.
[02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:32.070]  So, that's where we can get him.
[02:41:32.090 --> 02:41:34.711]  He can actually be prosecuted, I think, for using fake evidence.
[02:41:34.871 --> 02:41:39.352]  We just have to push that, or declassify that whole... It's called Marble Framework.
[02:41:39.432 --> 02:41:45.333]  The CIA and the NSA can create false metadata and use it in court.
[02:41:45.433 --> 02:41:46.893]  It's parallel construction.
[02:41:47.594 --> 02:41:49.194]  No, this is actually, this is interesting because
[02:41:51.371 --> 02:42:03.157]  The reason why he's able to get away with this is because the media will never hold his feet to the fire and the average, you know, leftist Trump-hater that wants to see him impeached doesn't even understand what he's ignoring here.
[02:42:03.757 --> 02:42:11.341]  And that's the fact that all of these claims about Russian hacking or meddling and all this stuff, there is zero basis to this day.
[02:42:11.581 --> 02:42:14.862]  They have literally presented zero evidence of that.
[02:42:16.583 --> 02:42:19.125]  Mainly because the evidence is classified and it's all made up.
[02:42:19.165 --> 02:42:20.065]  It's all fake evidence.
[02:42:20.549 --> 02:42:21.750]  And we just have to press that point.
[02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:23.451]  I got a funny thing for you.
[02:42:23.831 --> 02:42:25.812]  We have a new Indian name for Nancy Pelosi.
[02:42:26.613 --> 02:42:28.894]  It's called Three Things Holding Up Two Fingers.
[02:42:31.616 --> 02:42:34.898]  The President should always refer to her as Three Things Holding Up Two Fingers.
[02:42:35.399 --> 02:42:38.701]  And if you're not sure what Jefferson is referencing, thanks for the call, Jefferson.
[02:42:39.301 --> 02:42:47.787]  The other day, Nancy Pelosi, if she wasn't drunk, we feel really bad for her, held up two fingers when she was talking about three things.
[02:42:49.406 --> 02:42:54.093]  Yeah, you know, Nadler is passing out in the middle of an event.
[02:42:54.193 --> 02:42:58.399]  Pelosi can't even get through a press conference without sounding like a bumbling idiot.
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:00.622]  This is the State of the Democrat Party.
[02:43:02.792 --> 02:43:08.054]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:44:20.965 --> 02:44:21.566]  Is everything.
[02:44:22.447 --> 02:44:24.970]  My job means everything to me.
[02:44:25.351 --> 02:44:26.993]  It makes me feel good about myself.
[02:44:27.493 --> 02:44:31.739]  I tell my kids, my girls, my grandkids, that's the cap that we make.
[02:44:32.781 --> 02:44:33.662]  I make that cap.
[02:44:35.592 --> 02:44:37.854]  It means a lot working for the president.
[02:44:37.954 --> 02:44:43.038]  You have this little tingly on the inside, you know, and wow, we're really getting there, you know?
[02:44:43.618 --> 02:44:45.139]  Not getting there, we're there.
[02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:46.520]  This is my work.
[02:44:47.021 --> 02:44:52.605]  I make caps, and he picked us to make American Great Defense, so we gotta work.
[02:44:53.185 --> 02:45:00.691]  To know that I was a part of that history, oh my God, I'm so proud.
[02:45:01.412 --> 02:45:02.593]  My children are proud.
[02:45:02.693 --> 02:45:04.234]  My grandchildren are proud.
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:10.402]  We're so proud to have American workers manufacture this product.
[02:45:10.842 --> 02:45:13.843]  It's just been such an honor to make the hat.
[02:45:14.683 --> 02:45:18.685]  It's been incredible for not only our company, but our people that work here.
[02:45:21.109 --> 02:45:21.890]  Now it's a hat.
[02:45:22.470 --> 02:45:24.953]  Make America great again, which is what we're doing.
[02:45:25.013 --> 02:45:25.754]  Yay!
[02:45:25.934 --> 02:45:27.295]  We're making America great again.
[02:45:27.315 --> 02:45:28.596]  We're making America great again.
[02:45:28.616 --> 02:45:29.938]  100% made in the USA.
[02:45:29.958 --> 02:45:30.919]  100% made in the USA.
[02:45:30.939 --> 02:45:34.783]  100% made in the USA.
[02:45:34.883 --> 02:45:35.884]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:45:35.924 --> 02:45:37.205]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:45:37.225 --> 02:45:38.126]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:45:38.186 --> 02:45:39.427]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:45:39.447 --> 02:45:40.348]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:45:40.368 --> 02:45:41.830]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:43.711]  We're making America great again.
[02:45:43.731 --> 02:45:44.152]  We are.
[02:45:44.292 --> 02:45:46.453]  We're truly making America great again.
[02:45:46.473 --> 02:45:47.814]  Donald Trump is our president.
[02:45:47.854 --> 02:45:48.775]  He is my president.
[02:45:48.795 --> 02:45:51.356]  Donald Trump is our president.
[02:45:51.416 --> 02:45:55.198]  We're making America great again!
[02:45:58.020 --> 02:46:00.882]  No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.
[02:46:02.623 --> 02:46:09.407]  They issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers.
[02:46:11.308 --> 02:46:12.649]  Think of that, though.
[02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:14.009]  500 witnesses.
[02:46:14.530 --> 02:46:23.134]  And then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the President of the United States engaged in a cover-up.
[02:46:23.154 --> 02:46:26.116]  Now, we've had a House investigation.
[02:46:26.896 --> 02:46:28.557]  We have Senate investigations.
[02:46:29.358 --> 02:46:34.461]  We have investigations like nobody's ever had before, and we did nothing wrong.
[02:46:35.141 --> 02:46:36.762]  They would have loved to have said we
[02:46:38.134 --> 02:46:38.595]  Colluded.
[02:46:39.015 --> 02:46:39.836]  They would have loved it.
[02:46:39.916 --> 02:46:43.080]  These people were out to get us.
[02:46:44.102 --> 02:46:47.005]  The Republican Party and President Trump.
[02:46:47.045 --> 02:46:48.027]  They were out to get us.
[02:46:48.067 --> 02:46:50.570]  This was a one-sided, horrible thing.
[02:46:51.932 --> 02:46:54.315]  The bottom line is they said there's no collusion.
[02:46:54.495 --> 02:46:55.897]  No collusion with Russia.
[02:47:05.757 --> 02:47:08.364]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[02:47:57.344 --> 02:48:03.429]  Alright, I'm just gonna run down some news stories here, and then we'll squeeze in maybe a call or two.
[02:48:05.706 --> 02:48:10.769]  Nixom sex slave was an illegal immigrant whose status was used to keep her in line.
[02:48:11.229 --> 02:48:16.351]  So you got all kinds of stuff coming about the Nixom sex cult and even its ties to the government.
[02:48:17.172 --> 02:48:20.874]  So that's going to be interesting when that gets fully exposed, but the media probably won't report on it.
[02:48:21.434 --> 02:48:23.536]  That's why they censor us, because we do report on it.
[02:48:24.336 --> 02:48:26.698]  The Democrats are continuing to force Biden down our throat.
[02:48:26.738 --> 02:48:30.661]  They're continuing to run polls saying Biden is, you know, he's running away with it.
[02:48:30.701 --> 02:48:31.481]  He's got the lead.
[02:48:32.162 --> 02:48:33.983]  Where they get these numbers, who knows?
[02:48:34.463 --> 02:48:35.944]  But what is with this guy?
[02:48:35.984 --> 02:48:38.626]  He literally cannot keep his hands off women and children.
[02:48:39.807 --> 02:48:43.169]  At an event last night, Joe Biden had a young girl, 10-year-old,
[02:48:44.463 --> 02:48:45.164]  Ask him a question.
[02:48:45.224 --> 02:48:53.709]  He literally came up to her, grabbed her, took her back behind the scenes and was groping her for a long period of time after that.
[02:48:55.150 --> 02:48:58.032]  Why can't Joe Biden keep his hands off of children?
[02:48:58.672 --> 02:48:59.873]  What is wrong with this guy?
[02:48:59.933 --> 02:49:03.015]  He literally cannot keep his hands off of children.
[02:49:04.556 --> 02:49:06.517]  Sick, creepy, freak show.
[02:49:08.615 --> 02:49:15.057]  Missouri's last abortion clinic says it may lose its license this week, so Missouri is going one way, ending abortion.
[02:49:15.217 --> 02:49:16.417]  Illinois is going the other way.
[02:49:16.617 --> 02:49:19.958]  Illinois House makes abortion fundamental right with late-term bill.
[02:49:20.698 --> 02:49:22.799]  So, two states bordering each other.
[02:49:22.999 --> 02:49:25.700]  One going one way on abortion to stop murdering of innocent children.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:27.540]  State, I'm from Missouri.
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:29.281]  The other one, Illinois, going the other way.
[02:49:30.111 --> 02:49:30.411]  U.S.
[02:49:30.451 --> 02:49:35.335]  service members seeing wearing MAGA-inspired patches at Trump's speech may have violated DOD rules.
[02:49:35.375 --> 02:49:36.956]  So yeah, you're not allowed to support the president.
[02:49:37.096 --> 02:49:37.576]  It's bad.
[02:49:37.816 --> 02:49:40.578]  And we need to make a national case out of the...
[02:49:41.718 --> 02:49:42.018]  U.S.
[02:49:42.779 --> 02:49:44.501]  service members liking Trump.
[02:49:44.541 --> 02:49:45.421]  They're not allowed to do that.
[02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:49.065]  Army's Google Earth on steroids can look inside buildings.
[02:49:49.445 --> 02:49:51.927]  So basically, they basically can just do anything now.
[02:49:52.007 --> 02:49:53.088]  And that's ancient tech.
[02:49:53.248 --> 02:49:56.151]  Now it's just been integrated with basically Google Earth.
[02:49:56.751 --> 02:50:02.316]  CNN announces more layoff with, as Zucker reveals, network is losing $10 million a year.
[02:50:02.677 --> 02:50:04.739]  That's from Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com.
[02:50:05.839 --> 02:50:11.300]  So go to InfoWareStore.com and make sure we continue to kick CNN's ass as they continue to have us censored.
[02:50:11.320 --> 02:50:15.561]  So CNN has us censored and we just kick their ass.
[02:50:15.581 --> 02:50:17.822]  25% of Americans say they worry about money all the time.
[02:50:18.002 --> 02:50:20.202]  Cut the taxes.
[02:50:20.762 --> 02:50:22.683]  Cut the taxes.
[02:50:22.763 --> 02:50:23.963]  Did I say cut the taxes?
[02:50:24.023 --> 02:50:25.023]  I think we should cut the taxes.
[02:50:25.503 --> 02:50:28.464]  People will be having great sex without any human contact by 2025.
[02:50:30.299 --> 02:50:31.681]  Well, I wouldn't call that great sex then.
[02:50:31.721 --> 02:50:32.864]  That's a simulation.
[02:50:33.364 --> 02:50:34.026]  That's what they want.
[02:50:34.066 --> 02:50:40.297]  Just like they simulate news, just like they simulate communications, now they're going to be simulating sex.
[02:50:41.861 --> 02:50:46.506]  From ABC News, a thief snatched a tip jar filled with college tuition savings from a family business.
[02:50:46.646 --> 02:50:48.448]  I literally saw this happen in New Orleans.
[02:50:48.468 --> 02:50:54.975]  Some guy walked into a bar, stole an entire tip jar from a nice bartender, and it was pretty sad.
[02:50:55.055 --> 02:50:57.898]  So if you are a bartender listening, keep your eyes peeled.
[02:50:58.338 --> 02:51:02.183]  Teachers allegedly told to favor black students in racial equality training.
[02:51:02.203 --> 02:51:02.923]  This is in New York.
[02:51:03.684 --> 02:51:10.188]  So now black students receive the attention of the school, while the white students don't.
[02:51:10.688 --> 02:51:11.508]  But that's not racist.
[02:51:12.949 --> 02:51:13.750]  This is not normal.
[02:51:13.790 --> 02:51:15.951]  There have been more than 500 tornadoes in the U.S.
[02:51:15.971 --> 02:51:17.112]  during the last 30 days.
[02:51:17.332 --> 02:51:18.272]  Is it weather weapons?
[02:51:18.332 --> 02:51:19.553]  Is it man-made global warming?
[02:51:19.693 --> 02:51:21.534]  Who knows, but it's been devastating.
[02:51:22.374 --> 02:51:24.756]  You just had a racist attack in South Africa.
[02:51:25.694 --> 02:51:32.420]  Basically, if you're a white farmer in South Africa, you're clinging to your gun 24-7 because you never know when you might get attacked.
[02:51:33.241 --> 02:51:35.003]  There's another story on that at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:35.583 --> 02:51:36.384]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:51:36.444 --> 02:51:37.405]  Here's one from Dan Lyman.
[02:51:37.445 --> 02:51:40.228]  German city clearing student housing to make way for migrants.
[02:51:40.428 --> 02:51:43.231]  So yeah, if you're a German in Germany, you get nothing.
[02:51:43.831 --> 02:51:46.454]  But if you come from some other foreign land, you get everything.
[02:51:46.994 --> 02:51:47.274]  U.S.
[02:51:47.314 --> 02:51:50.895]  risks devastating blow from China's rare earth mineral monopoly.
[02:51:50.955 --> 02:51:52.915]  I remember InfoWars reporting on this five years ago.
[02:51:52.975 --> 02:51:53.536]  Nobody else did.
[02:51:53.556 --> 02:51:55.676]  Well, now the crows are coming home to roost.
[02:51:56.016 --> 02:52:00.497]  Somali parents sending their kids back to Africa to escape London knife crime epidemic.
[02:52:00.677 --> 02:52:00.977]  Wow.
[02:52:01.257 --> 02:52:03.918]  So now Somalia is a safer place to raise your kid than London?
[02:52:05.258 --> 02:52:11.460]  Suspect behind land parcel bomb attack is an illegal migrant from Algeria.
[02:52:12.754 --> 02:52:15.015]  Open borders is really working for Europe.
[02:52:15.075 --> 02:52:23.497]  All right, let's go back out to the phone lines and go to... Let's go to Julian in New Mexico.
[02:52:23.557 --> 02:52:24.297]  Go ahead, Julian.
[02:52:26.798 --> 02:52:27.798]  Hey Owen, how you doing?
[02:52:27.838 --> 02:52:33.200]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment, you know, let us not forget who we're dealing with here.
[02:52:33.260 --> 02:52:39.101]  Robert Bowler is one of the worst individuals in the history of our government.
[02:52:39.141 --> 02:52:41.882]  This man is responsible for some of the most heinous
[02:52:42.841 --> 02:52:46.622]  I mean, there's a lot of deep state operations out there and you nailed it right on the head today.
[02:52:46.642 --> 02:52:55.444]  About you know, the media has the majority, you know of the public under MK Ultra Project Mockingbird.
[02:52:56.084 --> 02:52:58.304]  You know, and Robert Bowler was the man.
[02:52:58.585 --> 02:53:02.785]  Let us not forget who cut Jeffrey Epstein, one of the sweetest deals.
[02:53:03.966 --> 02:53:09.447]  Was also one of the most heinous men out there to walk away with a slap on his wrist for the things that he's done.
[02:53:10.433 --> 02:53:21.821]  And Robert Bowler was appointed, you know, the cover-up job for 9-11, you know, and the American public doesn't even realize, you know, how deep this man goes.
[02:53:22.722 --> 02:53:30.147]  So for him to basically come out today was basically him just saying, you know, I got away with the biggest cover-up in U.S.
[02:53:30.187 --> 02:53:33.870]  history, and I washed Hillary Clinton and Obama's hands clean.
[02:53:34.410 --> 02:53:35.531]  And the sad part about it,
[02:53:36.548 --> 02:53:41.372]  Is that the media, like you said today, is going to take this narrative, spin it, run with it.
[02:53:42.513 --> 02:53:55.923]  And they're going to try to say, you know, that there was obstruction of justice, obstruction of justice, but they just couldn't pin it on him because of what Robert Mueller said in the press conference this morning, that it's unconstitutional.
[02:53:57.664 --> 02:53:58.865]  And it's just really sad.
[02:53:58.905 --> 02:54:02.508]  And the caller that called earlier, you know, said something about
[02:54:03.516 --> 02:54:04.056]  You know what?
[02:54:18.430 --> 02:54:20.072]  That's one of the narratives they're trying to sing.
[02:54:20.292 --> 02:54:20.913]  It's just sick.
[02:54:21.073 --> 02:54:23.316]  It's just the deception, the lies.
[02:54:23.956 --> 02:54:24.717]  It's really sick.
[02:54:24.937 --> 02:54:29.062]  And the fact that Epstein gets to walk a major pedophile sex trafficker.
[02:54:29.082 --> 02:54:35.189]  I mean, you read those reports about him, and he gets nothing, but Julian Assange is treated like a war criminal.
[02:54:35.629 --> 02:54:36.390]  Just makes you sick.
[02:54:36.430 --> 02:54:38.152]  It really shows you the clown world for what it is.
[02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:41.391]  You know, we really just need to pray so hard.
[02:54:41.471 --> 02:54:42.512]  Just beg God.
[02:54:42.952 --> 02:54:48.556]  Just beg God to intervene and save us from whatever karma is gonna come from all this.
[02:54:48.736 --> 02:54:56.560]  Because the evils and the crimes and everything that's been going on in this country that people have been burying in their head in the sand and ignoring, it's gonna come home to roost.
[02:54:57.501 --> 02:54:59.302]  And we better just pray for God that
[02:55:00.475 --> 02:55:06.124]  He allows us some time to maybe get ourselves out of this mess, but man, it's bad.
[02:55:06.144 --> 02:55:08.067]  I mean, it's bad.
[02:55:08.127 --> 02:55:09.089]  Thanks for the call, Julian.
[02:55:09.109 --> 02:55:10.331]  Let's go to Jan in Utah.
[02:55:10.371 --> 02:55:12.234]  Final caller, at least for me today.
[02:55:12.274 --> 02:55:13.516]  Mike Adams about to take over.
[02:55:13.556 --> 02:55:14.117]  Go ahead, Jan.
[02:55:15.936 --> 02:55:28.905]  I just want to say that I agree with the man from Ireland, and I'm really happy that you just said what you did, because I think any time a nation upholds and legalizes sin, the judgments of God come down upon it.
[02:55:29.426 --> 02:55:38.532]  But I believe that there's more good people in this country still than bad people, and the only thing that can save us is praying to God, and that's it.
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:52.852]  It really is, and you know, there are obviously works of man that are going to have to take place, too, for us to rid ourselves of this satanic corruption in the West.
[02:55:53.012 --> 02:56:00.700]  But, I mean, I think we both know what true karma would be unless God decides to intervene here in the West, and it's not good.
[02:56:01.921 --> 02:56:04.544]  Well, He can, and He will.
[02:56:05.433 --> 02:56:07.654]  If we trust him and do pray to him for that.
[02:56:07.735 --> 02:56:12.117]  And a separate individual like myself, what can we do really?
[02:56:12.538 --> 02:56:17.161]  We can try to expose it and try to let others know the truth, but then what do they do?
[02:56:17.621 --> 02:56:19.742]  We may know the truth, but what do we do about it?
[02:56:20.483 --> 02:56:25.946]  But I'm really thankful for people like Alex Jones and yourself that aren't afraid to report the truth.
[02:56:26.367 --> 02:56:34.672]  And I've been listening to Alex Jones for years, and this is the first time I've ever called him because I'm really concerned about the state of our own country also.
[02:56:35.834 --> 02:56:50.666]  No, it's a tough pill to swallow, Jan, when you look at all the corruption, and then you see people like Julian Assange treated like a war criminal, a guy that exposes war crimes, while war criminals like Hillary Clinton get to walk free.
[02:56:50.766 --> 02:56:51.787]  It makes you sick.
[02:56:52.388 --> 02:56:57.752]  And if the average citizen can't look at that and say, what the hell is going on here?
[02:56:57.812 --> 02:57:04.258]  Something isn't right, then they've been lulled to sleep by the media, they've been lulled to sleep by sports, by pop culture, by everything.
[02:57:05.078 --> 02:57:07.140]  And it's the tools of the devil.
[02:57:07.701 --> 02:57:10.984]  And we've fallen under mass psychosis in this country.
[02:57:12.105 --> 02:57:13.226]  Mass brainwashing.
[02:57:13.586 --> 02:57:14.607]  Call it MKUltra.
[02:57:14.647 --> 02:57:16.269]  Call it Project Mockingbird.
[02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:17.069]  Call it whatever you want.
[02:57:17.310 --> 02:57:18.070]  We know what it is.
[02:57:18.991 --> 02:57:23.576]  And if we don't shake ourselves free of it, and we have a chance to manifest it right now as humans,
[02:57:24.551 --> 02:57:25.632]  To do something about this.
[02:57:25.672 --> 02:57:26.453]  We elected Trump.
[02:57:26.473 --> 02:57:28.014]  We wanted to clean out the rot gut.
[02:57:28.054 --> 02:57:29.395]  We wanted to expose the corruption.
[02:57:29.415 --> 02:57:30.756]  We wanted to try to right the ship.
[02:57:30.996 --> 02:57:32.538]  We wanted to try to right ourselves.
[02:57:33.018 --> 02:57:36.041]  And we've got these damn demons that are keeping us from doing it!
[02:57:37.762 --> 02:57:39.303]  Ugh, I don't know where we go from here.
[02:57:39.323 --> 02:57:40.544]  Jan, thank you so much for the call.
[02:57:43.267 --> 02:57:44.808]  I don't want to go to civil war, folks.
[02:57:46.489 --> 02:57:50.813]  I don't want to see any of this happen, but I mean, this is just, it's unbelievable.
[02:58:08.508 --> 02:58:12.790]  You see Apple making these decisions, you know, based on, you know, if this is impacting us.
[02:58:13.210 --> 02:58:18.912]  Do you think that tech companies are in a position right now where they can self-regulate with some of these more sticky issues?
[02:58:20.234 --> 02:58:21.275]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[02:58:21.495 --> 02:58:26.180]  I run the richest company in the world, and I pay Chinese slave laborers, you know, a dollar a day.
[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:33.466]  I've moved Apple to China and given your iCloud keys to their government, and now I'm bringing Chinese censorship here to America and working with Google to do it.
[02:58:33.547 --> 02:58:34.748]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:58:35.876 --> 02:58:50.389]  Do you think, I mean it's interesting to hear you say that, I, just having covered a lot of this over the last months, I keep coming back to this fundamental question, and you can tell me if this is too philosophical for you, but I come back to this fundamental question, do we as users just have to re-envision the idea of privacy?
[02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:51.810]  Is it a luxury at this point?
[02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:53.091]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[02:58:53.411 --> 02:58:56.474]  The New York Times says, quote, I leave the moral high ground.
[02:58:56.534 --> 02:58:59.577]  That Apple, via Tim Cook, leaves the moral high ground.
[02:59:00.589 --> 02:59:07.294]  So, our company pays zero taxes in China, and we run slave factories, but I'm helping shut down free speech in America.
[02:59:07.574 --> 02:59:09.455]  That makes me liberal.
[02:59:09.875 --> 02:59:19.342]  One of the interesting points today, and I know this is an issue near and dear to you and to Apple, you guys created a pride feature for Apple Watch.
[02:59:19.942 --> 02:59:28.067]  You know, just this morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake in celebration of a same-sex couple.
[02:59:29.268 --> 02:59:36.318]  As a leader in the community, as Apple has, you know, continuously stood in front of LGBTQ rights, what's your reaction?
[02:59:36.798 --> 02:59:37.659]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:44.088]  I'm gay, but I don't say a word to China, even though I'm the biggest company in China, about how they execute gays.
[02:59:54.557 --> 02:59:58.681]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.201 --> 03:00:00.522]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.465 --> 03:00:12.112]  The West is the best.
[03:00:15.751 --> 03:00:29.103]  Mike Adams is about to take over the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show here today, and I wanted to just hand the mic over to Mike while we discuss everything that we've talked about so far here today.
[03:00:29.543 --> 03:00:32.286]  Mike, obviously the hot topic are the statements by Mueller.
[03:00:32.546 --> 03:00:38.311]  I'm not sure if that's what you have planned coming up today for your coverage or if there is something else, but I'm sure you've been listening.
[03:00:38.732 --> 03:00:42.115]  So, Mike, what are your thoughts on what we've seen and heard so far today?
[03:00:42.912 --> 03:00:53.696]  Well, yes, I do intend to cover some analysis of Robert Mueller's statement and his continued attempted illegal coup against our constitutional republic.
[03:00:54.136 --> 03:01:02.939]  And what I'm going to cover are details of why it's clear that Robert Mueller is a criminal, an enemy of the people of America, and should be among those
[03:01:03.579 --> 03:01:08.442]  Who are arrested by military police and held for military tribunals, in my opinion.
[03:01:08.863 --> 03:01:18.729]  I don't know if that's the InfoWars view on this, but that's my analysis and I'm going to share it here with you and give you my reasoning why it's necessary to restore the rule of law in America.
[03:01:18.749 --> 03:01:21.331]  It's not an act of vengeance against the enemies of Trump.
[03:01:21.751 --> 03:01:23.593]  It's an act of restoring the rule of law.
[03:01:23.653 --> 03:01:25.274]  So that's coming up in a whole lot more.
[03:01:25.354 --> 03:01:25.554]  Owen?
[03:01:25.994 --> 03:01:27.295]  No, I mean, it's basic stuff.
[03:01:27.415 --> 03:01:33.099]  If you, you know, let's say you have a friend or, you know, cousin or whatever, and they're
[03:01:34.299 --> 03:01:36.480]  They're possessed by the devil.
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:37.800]  You have an exorcism, right?
[03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:39.041]  I mean, that's what you do.
[03:01:39.601 --> 03:01:41.141]  We need an exorcism in this country.
[03:01:41.822 --> 03:01:43.222]  That's what this really comes down to.
[03:01:43.242 --> 03:01:49.544]  And I mean, Mike, we're basically kind of left... I don't know.
[03:01:49.784 --> 03:01:55.666]  I hate saying this because I don't actually feel it's true, but it does feel like where we're at.
[03:01:56.715 --> 03:02:03.906]  Well, we're kind of just at the behest of the President and Barr right now to see if we're ever going to get justice in this country.
[03:02:04.446 --> 03:02:09.254]  I mean, are we going to have another situation where Mueller just walks away and just covers up massive crimes?
[03:02:10.638 --> 03:02:21.146]  I think many American patriots, conservatives, constitutionalists, even veterans are patiently waiting for Trump and Barr to invoke the rule of law.
[03:02:21.867 --> 03:02:25.469]  They are, the patriots of America, are holding back.
[03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:27.511]  I think if Trump were not president,
[03:02:28.197 --> 03:02:33.382]  I think if Hillary Clinton had won the presidency, my guess is we'd already be in a civil war at this point.
[03:02:33.962 --> 03:02:35.343]  Trump has prevented that.
[03:02:35.844 --> 03:02:39.087]  And Trump has a chance to prevail against this deep state.
[03:02:39.687 --> 03:02:43.611]  And the patriots and the law-abiding citizens of America do not want to resort.
[03:02:44.292 --> 03:02:47.233]  to having to invoke the self-defense of their nation.
[03:02:47.633 --> 03:02:51.254]  They are willing to, as a last resort, but they will never initiate violence.
[03:02:51.814 --> 03:03:06.179]  But at the same time, Mo, and I'm going to cover this too in this coming hour, the left has not reached a point of desperation where they could unleash any kind of deep state attack, bomb, dirty bomb, chemical weapon, mass shooting, anything to change the narrative.
[03:03:06.219 --> 03:03:08.140]  But there's a very important reason why that
[03:03:09.051 --> 03:03:09.771]  We're good to go.
[03:03:24.676 --> 03:03:26.017]  To actually do something about it.
[03:03:26.437 --> 03:03:32.362]  And you know, Mike, I wonder, too, because there's no doubt there's stuff like that in the works, and this is an international criminal cabal we're dealing with.
[03:03:32.842 --> 03:03:46.992]  So even if, you know, the members of the Deep State here and, you know, globalists or whatever secret society members here, even if they have lost the reins of the ability to do something like that in the West, this is an international criminal cabal.
[03:03:47.213 --> 03:03:48.333]  We have a wide open southern border.
[03:03:48.614 --> 03:03:49.895]  There's no telling what they might do.
[03:03:51.283 --> 03:04:00.531]  I have a feeling in response to this, they're going to try to initiate and activate their left-wing street thug squads, like the Nazi Brownshirts.
[03:04:01.131 --> 03:04:05.154]  I'm just wondering if the morale is really there, and if the energy is really there.
[03:04:05.174 --> 03:04:11.139]  I mean, they're going through new levels of trying to intimidate and set me up.
[03:04:11.159 --> 03:04:13.141]  I don't even want to talk about what I'm dealing with right now.
[03:04:13.681 --> 03:04:17.804]  Well, their morale will be shattered the moment they are engaged, Owen.
[03:04:17.924 --> 03:04:18.705]  It's that simple.
[03:04:19.405 --> 03:04:24.088]  Again, the American patriots are holding back and patiently waiting for the rule of law to be restored.
[03:04:24.529 --> 03:04:28.592]  But if the domestic terrorism wing of the Democrat Party, i.e.
[03:04:28.692 --> 03:04:38.599]  Antifa, if Antifa takes to the streets and starts carrying out violence, I believe at this point they would be met and engaged by patriots and the morale of the leftists would be shattered
[03:04:39.339 --> 03:04:40.820]  Within the first magazine.
[03:04:40.981 --> 03:04:42.902]  And here's what I don't understand.
[03:04:42.942 --> 03:04:49.047]  How do these Antifa people not see they're the ones being drug around by the FBI, the CIA that they claim to hate?
[03:04:49.388 --> 03:04:50.849]  Trump isn't from the government, man.
[03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:53.151]  Trump is outside of the establishment.
[03:04:53.191 --> 03:04:54.272]  That's why they hate him.
[03:04:54.632 --> 03:04:56.013]  Why can't you see that yet?
[03:04:56.433 --> 03:04:58.375]  How is this MKUltra so strong?
[03:04:58.655 --> 03:05:00.357]  Mike Adams takes over on the other side.
[03:05:05.037 --> 03:05:11.781]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:05:12.361 --> 03:05:14.963]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[03:05:15.483 --> 03:05:16.403]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[03:05:17.084 --> 03:05:19.265]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:05:19.785 --> 03:05:20.746]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:05:21.266 --> 03:05:27.289]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:29.651]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[03:05:30.231 --> 03:05:30.932]  I'm not the leader.
[03:05:31.232 --> 03:05:31.833]  You are the leader.
[03:05:32.033 --> 03:05:33.635]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:05:34.015 --> 03:05:38.760]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[03:05:39.421 --> 03:05:46.868]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[03:05:46.888 --> 03:05:48.210]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:49.471]  I want to encourage you again.
[03:05:50.212 --> 03:05:54.658]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[03:05:54.899 --> 03:05:57.663]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[03:05:58.043 --> 03:05:59.946]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[03:06:00.186 --> 03:06:00.647]  God bless you.
[03:06:09.568 --> 03:06:15.513]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:06:16.174 --> 03:06:18.036]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:06:18.476 --> 03:06:21.378]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:21.399 --> 03:06:26.003]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:27.204 --> 03:06:28.144]  This is Mike Adams here.
[03:06:28.225 --> 03:06:30.627]  Owen, are you still in the studio?
[03:06:30.647 --> 03:06:31.888]  No.
[03:06:32.708 --> 03:06:33.208]  Okay, okay.
[03:06:33.468 --> 03:06:33.709]  All right.
[03:06:33.829 --> 03:06:36.270]  Owen, thanks for bringing me in.
[03:06:36.470 --> 03:06:37.891]  Sorry about the little glitch there.
[03:06:38.191 --> 03:06:41.153]  In any case, I got a big show lined up for you here for the rest of the hour.
[03:06:41.213 --> 03:06:44.935]  Owen did a great job, of course, for the first three hours.
[03:06:45.655 --> 03:06:52.979]  And now we're going to get into analysis of Robert Mueller, why the military tribunal's arrests need to begin taking place.
[03:06:53.679 --> 03:06:56.182]  And why it may be weeks or months before that happens.
[03:06:56.282 --> 03:06:57.584]  So here's my analysis.
[03:06:57.624 --> 03:07:07.635]  And again, my disclaimer is I don't know if my analysis happens to match up exactly with the rest of InfoWars or Alex Jones analysis.
[03:07:08.075 --> 03:07:14.723]  That's actually the great thing about being a fill-in guest for Alex Jones is Alex never tells you what to say.
[03:07:15.603 --> 03:07:17.204]  There's no mandatory view.
[03:07:17.244 --> 03:07:20.485]  You know how the mainstream media, they all get their marching orders every day?
[03:07:20.825 --> 03:07:21.805]  Like, you have to say this.
[03:07:21.945 --> 03:07:22.566]  Use these words.
[03:07:22.686 --> 03:07:23.466]  Use these phrases.
[03:07:23.486 --> 03:07:25.607]  And they're all tested to try to demonize Trump.
[03:07:26.247 --> 03:07:34.170]  Here on InfoWars, all of us who are fill-in hosts or guests or fourth-hour hosts, we get to say what we want to say.
[03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:36.671]  And we're never given orders.
[03:07:37.271 --> 03:07:39.632]  Nothing ever happens like that.
[03:07:39.652 --> 03:07:42.353]  I've never had a call from Alex, like, you have to talk about this.
[03:07:42.373 --> 03:07:42.953]  It never happens.
[03:07:43.519 --> 03:07:44.580]  So this is my analysis.
[03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:45.640]  It's mine alone.
[03:07:46.201 --> 03:07:48.062]  And I don't know if everybody else agrees with it, but here it is.
[03:07:49.183 --> 03:07:55.927]  I think it's clear, especially from Robert Mueller's statements today, that Mueller was in on this from the very beginning.
[03:07:56.567 --> 03:08:00.810]  The entire Russia collusion hoax was a farce to begin with.
[03:08:01.470 --> 03:08:06.953]  Where is paragraph one of the justification for the special counsel in the first place?
[03:08:07.554 --> 03:08:10.616]  Where's the crime that was supposed to be investigated?
[03:08:10.636 --> 03:08:12.437]  You see, a special counsel is only supposed to be
[03:08:13.203 --> 03:08:13.884]  We're good to go.
[03:08:35.566 --> 03:08:45.413]  And in my analysis, his complicity goes all the way back to Hillary Clinton, Uranium One, and the corruption at the highest levels of the FBI that has been in place for decades.
[03:08:46.013 --> 03:08:49.476]  It goes way beyond James Comey or Christopher Wray or Robert Mueller.
[03:08:49.496 --> 03:08:50.656]  It's been going on for decades.
[03:08:51.757 --> 03:08:59.643]  So I believe that as William Barr and Donald Trump are now at war against the deep state, that's essentially what it is.
[03:08:59.703 --> 03:09:03.105]  There is a civil war inside the administration.
[03:09:04.091 --> 03:09:11.573]  And all the stay-behind networks of Obama and Hillary Clinton from her State Department days, those stay-behind networks are traitors.
[03:09:12.053 --> 03:09:16.154]  As Liz Cheney said the other day, they are carrying out literal acts of treason.
[03:09:16.995 --> 03:09:24.337]  And William Barr and President Trump are working to clean out that swamp, and they're working to restore the rule of law.
[03:09:25.185 --> 03:09:27.646]  But they have to be very careful how they do this.
[03:09:27.706 --> 03:09:29.126]  They cannot overreach.
[03:09:29.627 --> 03:09:32.328]  You can't declare martial law too early.
[03:09:32.668 --> 03:09:37.789]  Not until the evidence against the traitors is overwhelming and in the public domain.
[03:09:38.810 --> 03:09:45.812]  So this effort to declassify documents, which will take time because of the retractions and the internal reviews that need to take place.
[03:09:46.432 --> 03:09:47.733]  Or redactions, I should say.
[03:09:48.133 --> 03:09:49.073]  This will take some time.
[03:09:49.534 --> 03:09:53.395]  But as this takes place over the next few months, what I believe is happening is that
[03:09:54.022 --> 03:10:23.216]  Barr and Trump are, in effect, building a case for the invocation of military police arrests, the invocation of the Insurrection Act, which is essentially a form of localized temporary martial law in certain jurisdictions, in order to seek out, arrest, charge, and hold for trial the traitors, the deep state traitors, who literally tried to overthrow the President of the United States and overthrow a democratic election.
[03:10:23.888 --> 03:10:25.729]  Those are crimes against the state.
[03:10:25.789 --> 03:10:28.390]  Those are crimes against we, the people, effectively.
[03:10:29.010 --> 03:10:33.591]  And those crimes have to be outed, and they have to be prosecuted.
[03:10:33.771 --> 03:10:36.632]  Otherwise, we don't have the rule of law in this country.
[03:10:37.133 --> 03:10:44.075]  And that's my point here, is that this is not about vengeance, this is not about revenge against those who tried to take down Trump but failed.
[03:10:44.635 --> 03:10:49.117]  This is really about the rule of law, and if we are going to resume
[03:10:50.271 --> 03:10:52.412]  Or restore the rule of law in this country.
[03:10:52.792 --> 03:11:04.534]  We must hold accountable those who have sought to, they conspired to violate the rule of law, to overthrow our constitutional republic, and to silence the voice of the people.
[03:11:05.275 --> 03:11:07.295]  That's what overturning an election is.
[03:11:07.415 --> 03:11:09.015]  To silence the voice of the people.
[03:11:09.696 --> 03:11:19.578]  And note that these same deep state traitors have ordered the tech giants, like Facebook and Google and YouTube and so on, Twitter, to also silence the voice of the people.
[03:11:20.239 --> 03:11:23.619]  This coordinated censorship is an extension
[03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:27.791]  Of the treason that is being carried out against the United States of America.
[03:11:28.332 --> 03:11:29.792]  It is not simply coincidence.
[03:11:30.113 --> 03:11:31.894]  It's not simply parallel to it.
[03:11:32.234 --> 03:11:33.515]  It is an extension of it.
[03:11:33.535 --> 03:11:34.976]  It's all the same policy.
[03:11:35.476 --> 03:11:51.566]  Which is that those deep state traders, whether they run tech companies, whether they declare sanctuary cities as mayors or governors of sanctuary states, or whether they ran the FISA court fraud from inside the FBI, or whether they planted illegal spies into the Trump campaign,
[03:11:52.266 --> 03:12:08.199]  All of these individuals that I named, including, by the way, treasonous federal judges or district judges who are now engaged in dictatorial, fascist, judicial supremacy decisions that are trying to overthrow our constitutional republic.
[03:12:08.540 --> 03:12:15.726]  All of these individuals are, in fact, in my view, guilty of treason against the United States of America.
[03:12:15.926 --> 03:12:19.469]  And there are many so-called journalists who are complicit in this.
[03:12:20.069 --> 03:12:21.850]  They were accomplices in this.
[03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:32.615]  They worked with deep state leakers to push false or misleading information to poison the minds of the American people as part of a plot to overthrow this country.
[03:12:33.316 --> 03:12:35.016]  All of these people need to be held accountable.
[03:12:35.997 --> 03:12:47.843]  And it's easy for all of us, InfoWars fans, patriots, veterans, all of us, it's easy for us to be impatient about this, to say, now, now, it needs to happen now, we've got to take our country back now.
[03:12:48.103 --> 03:12:48.623]  And I get that.
[03:12:49.614 --> 03:13:00.802]  But we also have to have patience with the process that it takes to make this a lawful and legitimate restoration of the rule of law in America.
[03:13:01.063 --> 03:13:04.545]  And that's going to require these previously classified documents to come out.
[03:13:04.605 --> 03:13:06.787]  It's going to require analysis of those documents.
[03:13:07.227 --> 03:13:13.332]  We need to continue to listen to the good reporting of people like Sarah Carter, for example.
[03:13:13.592 --> 03:13:18.816]  You know, I'm talking about sort of mainstream media reporters, John Solomon, you know, Sheryl Atkinson and so on.
[03:13:19.435 --> 03:13:24.357]  In addition to the independent media that you're watching right now, all of these voices are important.
[03:13:24.917 --> 03:13:26.637]  We need to have patience with this process.
[03:13:27.197 --> 03:13:28.558]  Now, but here's the big risk.
[03:13:29.278 --> 03:13:41.782]  During this time, this gives the radical left, the deep state left, a chance to activate their false flag operations, to try to cause massive chaos, to try to cause a distraction.
[03:13:43.027 --> 03:13:47.612]  Chaos to rip President Trump off of his plan to expose the deep state.
[03:13:47.932 --> 03:13:53.317]  The deep state may literally unleash every terror cell that they had previously set up.
[03:13:53.557 --> 03:13:56.721]  They may activate every mass shooter, every Manchurian candidate.
[03:13:57.161 --> 03:14:00.985]  They may unleash every dirty bomb that they've ever been able to acquire in terms of material.
[03:14:01.676 --> 03:14:13.004]  They may even pay off terror groups to sneak across the border, bring in dirty bombs from Mexico, and then unleash them with, you know, conventional kinetic explosives somewhere in the United States.
[03:14:13.364 --> 03:14:28.434]  And one of my great concerns about this is that they may, they are so evil at this point, they are so cornered, they're like cornered rats, they may try to take out our president with an area effect dirty bomb weapon that doesn't even kill
[03:14:29.249 --> 03:14:39.233]  The president immediately, but rather poisons him with radiation that would impact his health and perhaps terminate his life in the months ahead.
[03:14:39.573 --> 03:14:43.175]  And for the deranged deep state left, they would consider that a victory.
[03:14:43.695 --> 03:14:50.577]  But they would kill maybe half a million people in order to take out President Trump through such a false flag scenario.
[03:14:50.597 --> 03:14:53.219]  But a real dirty bomb, but a false narrative.
[03:14:54.379 --> 03:14:56.800]  I'm very concerned that they may try that.
[03:14:57.509 --> 03:15:11.217]  I think that the deep state traitors of this country are so desperate and are so evil and so malicious that they would absolutely try to, they would kill hundreds of thousands of American people if they got rid of Trump in the process.
[03:15:11.577 --> 03:15:13.238]  That's the point where we are in history.
[03:15:13.918 --> 03:15:19.981]  And by the way, if they did manage to do something like that, and let us pray that they would never succeed in something like that.
[03:15:20.482 --> 03:15:24.564]  If they did, if they, if they harmed Trump or took out our president,
[03:15:25.248 --> 03:15:28.770]  That would unleash what I call the Second Amendment activation.
[03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:48.962]  The national immune system of patriots, of Americans, who love their country, want to protect their country, and are tired of us being overrun and enslaved by the tyrannical fascists of the left.
[03:15:49.102 --> 03:15:49.983]  We're tired of it.
[03:15:50.023 --> 03:15:50.643]  We've had enough.
[03:15:51.103 --> 03:15:52.064]  It's time to stop that.
[03:15:52.970 --> 03:15:54.152]  And it's time to take America back.
[03:15:54.192 --> 03:15:56.915]  We'll have much more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:57.255 --> 03:15:57.836]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:15:57.876 --> 03:15:58.497]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:10.123 --> 03:16:26.539]  ...has been the apple of the world's eye for 244 years because our electoral system fused ancient Roman, ancient Greek, ancient Judaic law, ancient British common law systems from the Iroquois Federation in the Northwest into Canada.
[03:16:26.639 --> 03:16:27.600]  That is the system.
[03:16:27.820 --> 03:16:29.162]  It had checks and balances.
[03:16:29.182 --> 03:16:31.184]  It didn't allow for dictators.
[03:16:31.824 --> 03:16:33.825]  It didn't allow for too much concentration of power.
[03:16:34.045 --> 03:16:39.928]  And what were you going to do if the North of the United States had three times the population of the South?
[03:16:40.429 --> 03:16:42.870]  Geographically, the South was much larger.
[03:16:42.970 --> 03:16:53.175]  You didn't want to have the majority of the North be able to set all the laws for the South because you'd just be replacing King George III with Northern voters.
[03:16:54.116 --> 03:16:56.537]  It's called the tyranny of the majority.
[03:16:57.674 --> 03:17:03.998]  In a classic democracy, if 51% vote to kill you, it happens.
[03:17:04.319 --> 03:17:11.404]  Actually, in ancient Greece, when they had original pure democracy in one particular city-state, they had black stones for no, white stones for yes.
[03:17:11.664 --> 03:17:14.266]  And only the gentry elite could vote, but it was a pure democracy.
[03:17:14.386 --> 03:17:17.308]  And if they didn't like what you said, there was no judge or jury.
[03:17:17.408 --> 03:17:18.328]  There was the people's jury.
[03:17:18.388 --> 03:17:23.612]  And they would put rocks in the bucket saying, kill you, and you would be thrown off a cliff or given hemlock.
[03:17:23.772 --> 03:17:23.852]  Yeah.
[03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:43.031]  We have a constitutional republic, or a liberal democracy.
[03:17:43.071 --> 03:17:45.872]  So, imagine you're somebody in Wyoming.
[03:17:45.992 --> 03:17:48.814]  You only get three members of the House of Representatives.
[03:17:49.034 --> 03:17:50.234]  California, how many do they have?
[03:17:50.254 --> 03:17:50.915]  50-something?
[03:17:50.955 --> 03:17:51.855]  It's an incredible number.
[03:17:51.875 --> 03:17:52.615]  Look it up, I forget.
[03:17:52.675 --> 03:17:55.857]  The point is, is that Wyoming gets two senators, and so does California.
[03:17:55.977 --> 03:17:57.678]  It's a beautiful check and balance.
[03:17:57.918 --> 03:18:04.221]  So see, in the House, you get represented by population, but there's a check and a balance in case things get out of control in the House.
[03:18:04.901 --> 03:18:11.122]  Then there's a power of veto by the fact that your rural state still has those two senators.
[03:18:11.663 --> 03:18:20.685]  And previous to the 17th Amendment from 1913, the same day we got the Federal Reserve, same day we got the IRS, our new system, they took the senators away.
[03:18:20.705 --> 03:18:25.606]  The senators weren't just a check on the House, they were a check on the executive.
[03:18:25.826 --> 03:18:27.806]  Senators were from the state.
[03:18:27.926 --> 03:18:31.307]  So that you have 50 states in a confederation, 13 states at that time,
[03:18:31.527 --> 03:18:36.989]  And they foresaw a civil war if you could have the tyranny of the majority vote away the rights of others.
[03:18:37.069 --> 03:18:39.770]  And that kind of still happened with the Civil War that came up in the 1860s.
[03:18:39.810 --> 03:18:41.270]  So our system isn't perfect.
[03:18:41.310 --> 03:18:46.792]  And so you don't want two or three states in a popular vote being able to presidentially outvote everybody else.
[03:18:46.972 --> 03:18:49.152]  But getting rid of the Electoral College goes far beyond that.
[03:18:49.352 --> 03:18:59.956]  It completes what the globalists tried to do in 1913 with the Federal Reserve and the 17th Amendment, where senators used to be elected by the House or the legislature in their state.
[03:19:00.016 --> 03:19:00.676]  Let me explain that again.
[03:19:00.816 --> 03:19:09.978]  They would have votes in the state legislatures over who their senator was they were going to send so that it was a federal office.
[03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:20.227]  But it was a creature of the state giving the state direct veto power into the Senate in case those senators got bought off.
[03:19:20.827 --> 03:19:24.090]  So checks and balances inside checks and balances.
[03:19:24.470 --> 03:19:28.013]  The world envy of the planet.
[03:19:28.554 --> 03:19:32.597]  The closest to perfection you're going to find.
[03:19:32.917 --> 03:19:33.718]  No one has denied it.
[03:19:34.598 --> 03:19:36.238]  Easy to rig parliamentary systems.
[03:19:36.859 --> 03:19:38.039]  Easy to rig other systems.
[03:19:38.379 --> 03:19:39.459]  Very hard to rig this one.
[03:19:39.939 --> 03:19:44.040]  And that's why they want to get rid of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:45.120]  And they're very close.
[03:19:45.261 --> 03:19:46.001]  They're very close.
[03:19:46.021 --> 03:19:48.461]  They've gotten most of the blue wall states to pass it.
[03:19:48.581 --> 03:19:59.884]  And then we'll have the tyranny, just like in science fiction, you know, movies out there, where you've got the different districts, and the one big powerful district, like in Hunger Games, rules all the others, because it has the big population.
[03:20:06.315 --> 03:20:08.919]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.307 --> 03:20:25.048]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:20:25.568 --> 03:20:30.750]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:20:31.290 --> 03:20:35.131]  All right, continuing here on the Alex Jones Show, thank you for joining us.
[03:20:35.171 --> 03:20:36.271]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:20:37.392 --> 03:20:42.934]  Just leading off here, I really want to urge you to continue your support for the independent media.
[03:20:43.034 --> 03:20:50.716]  InfoWars is a crucial platform for fighting against the deep state that has literally tried to overthrow this country.
[03:20:51.323 --> 03:21:04.775]  And all of us who contribute to InfoWars are doing so out of a sense of patriotism, out of a sense of love for our country, love for our president and what he stands for, the Constitution, all these things.
[03:21:05.556 --> 03:21:07.137]  You can go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:21:07.177 --> 03:21:09.939]  There's a Memorial Day special that continues all this week.
[03:21:10.500 --> 03:21:15.224]  The 8-pack Power Pack, which is a combination of many of the top products, is 50% off.
[03:21:16.983 --> 03:21:23.210]  Through that Memorial Day sale, Survival Shield, Brain Force, many other products that are on special right now.
[03:21:23.550 --> 03:21:28.495]  This is a fantastic way to support this network and also support your good health at the same time.
[03:21:28.535 --> 03:21:30.497]  It's the Memorial Day mega sale.
[03:21:30.918 --> 03:21:32.960]  Don't miss that at InfoWars store.
[03:21:34.636 --> 03:21:43.285]  I even told Alex before on air that I think it's the nutrition of his products and nutrition that I take as well as a food scientist.
[03:21:43.325 --> 03:21:54.657]  I think this is what has enabled us to stay so alive and so active and so informed during this time of incredible stress and attacks and economic sabotage and death threats and everything.
[03:21:55.017 --> 03:21:56.279]  Nutrition saves your life.
[03:21:56.897 --> 03:22:02.645]  Nutrition also saves your life in a survival scenario, by the way, because it allows you to adapt to stress.
[03:22:03.266 --> 03:22:06.290]  I can't tell you how important it is to have turmeric.
[03:22:06.966 --> 03:22:10.368]  During a an S.H.T.F.
[03:22:10.828 --> 03:22:11.369]  scenario.
[03:22:11.829 --> 03:22:13.570]  I can't say that on the air, but you know what I'm talking about.
[03:22:13.950 --> 03:22:15.551]  You need some adaptogenic herbs.
[03:22:16.151 --> 03:22:18.333]  You need some essential oils for first aid.
[03:22:18.653 --> 03:22:21.475]  Manuka honey, for example, just to say one item.
[03:22:21.815 --> 03:22:22.435]  Manuka honey.
[03:22:22.815 --> 03:22:29.399]  Not only can you eat it, not only can you barter it as a first as a as a sweetener or a first aid item, you can put it on your skin.
[03:22:29.459 --> 03:22:30.500]  It's antibacterial.
[03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:35.024]  It can treat burns and simple wounds and everything, and guess what?
[03:22:35.124 --> 03:22:38.067]  It stores for over 100 years, so it's the ultimate barter item.
[03:22:38.087 --> 03:22:39.328]  You should think about these things.
[03:22:39.949 --> 03:22:42.552]  A lot of these products you can get at infowarestore.com.
[03:22:42.572 --> 03:22:46.816]  I don't know if they've got Manuka honey, but maybe they do, or maybe they will in the future.
[03:22:46.876 --> 03:22:50.179]  In any case, a couple other quick programming notes.
[03:22:50.719 --> 03:22:52.041]  In the interest of self-defense,
[03:22:53.050 --> 03:22:56.972]  And exercising our Second Amendment rights, I have a video coming out tomorrow.
[03:22:57.532 --> 03:23:01.534]  I'm going to ask InfoWars to post it on InfoWars.com.
[03:23:02.014 --> 03:23:21.444]  It's a personal tour of my personal battle belt equipment, my rig, what I have set up for my rifle, my sling, my optics, my battle belt, the magazines, the tourniquets, the trauma pads, the knife setup, which pistol I use, which everything.
[03:23:22.102 --> 03:23:23.045]  It's a detailed review.
[03:23:23.546 --> 03:23:25.932]  That's the Health Rangers Battle Belt video coming out tomorrow.
[03:23:26.674 --> 03:23:28.097]  Hopefully it'll be on InfoWars.com.
[03:23:28.117 --> 03:23:31.185]  It'll also be on Riteon.com, our video website.
[03:23:32.034 --> 03:23:32.935]  That's good information.
[03:23:33.215 --> 03:23:34.816]  But I always encourage you, keep it legal.
[03:23:35.197 --> 03:23:42.162]  We're not advocating any kind of instigating of any kind of, you know, violence or anything of the kind.
[03:23:42.242 --> 03:23:44.504]  In fact, we are the ones who are holding back.
[03:23:44.885 --> 03:23:51.950]  We are the ones who are saying, wait, let's wait for this process of Trump and Barr to work its way through the system.
[03:23:52.491 --> 03:24:00.738]  But if radical leftists pull some kind of nationwide communist coup takeover attempt and they take to the streets and they start
[03:24:01.338 --> 03:24:05.700]  You know, pulling people out of their homes and bashing them on the heads with spiked baseball bats.
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:17.704]  My prediction is that patriots will engage those domestic terrorists and all patriots need to be ready to do that in the defense of their communities, in the defense of their local law enforcement.
[03:24:18.364 --> 03:24:24.206]  Because believe me, local sheriffs and sheriff's deputies and police officers, they will need your help.
[03:24:24.941 --> 03:24:44.694]  I know this because every time I'm out at a gun range and I'm doing my exercises, I'm doing bilateral shooting with an AR, I'm doing rapid transitions, reloads, things like that, I always, when cops are there, they're always coming up to me and asking me about their gear, do I have recommendations, how do I, what technique am I using, how am I doing that?
[03:24:45.234 --> 03:24:49.937]  Some of them recognize me, you know, they thank me for being on InfoWars and they ask for my help.
[03:24:50.859 --> 03:25:02.408]  Cops, by and large, are good people, but they don't have good gear, and they're not allowed enough time for training, and usually they're not given enough ammo to practice to a point of proficiency.
[03:25:02.969 --> 03:25:06.071]  I know that sheriffs and sheriff's deputies are often given 50 rounds a month.
[03:25:07.212 --> 03:25:08.733]  50 rounds a month for training?
[03:25:09.734 --> 03:25:11.195]  Okay, that's not even a warm-up.
[03:25:11.355 --> 03:25:17.300]  When I'm on the range, 50 rounds, that's just, I'm just making sure the trigger's working, you know, properly in 50 rounds.
[03:25:17.972 --> 03:25:21.794]  You know, I'll go through a thousand rounds in a typical training.
[03:25:22.474 --> 03:25:24.135]  That's how you achieve proficiency.
[03:25:24.235 --> 03:25:27.917]  And sadly, a lot of cops and a lot of law enforcement don't have that level of proficiency.
[03:25:28.377 --> 03:25:30.658]  They will need the help of military veterans.
[03:25:31.699 --> 03:25:34.180]  They will need the help of citizens who are well-trained.
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:43.205]  They will need assistance by law-abiding citizens as this civil war unfolds, which at this point, sadly, it looks inevitable.
[03:25:43.345 --> 03:25:44.405]  It looks inescapable.
[03:25:45.145 --> 03:25:46.026]  And on that point,
[03:25:46.917 --> 03:25:55.342]  I really want to mention the power grid going down at least locally or regionally is a very high probability as these things unfold.
[03:25:56.062 --> 03:26:06.188]  And wherever you are in America, maybe around the world, but especially if you're in an American city, you need to think about how are you going to get by when the power grid is down?
[03:26:06.860 --> 03:26:10.522]  There are several scenarios where the power grid might go down accidentally.
[03:26:10.962 --> 03:26:13.944]  It might be hit with a cyber war false flag attack.
[03:26:14.384 --> 03:26:17.265]  It might be subjected to an EMP effect attack.
[03:26:18.006 --> 03:26:24.649]  If a deep state rogue, you know, nuclear missile gets launched into high altitude and detonated there for an EMP effect.
[03:26:25.229 --> 03:26:34.234]  Or it might be taken down by substations actually being attacked and deliberately taken down outside the cities, rendering the power grid inoperable inside the cities.
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:27:03.247]  I want you to remember, without a power grid, not only do you have no water, no running water because the pumps don't work, you have no fuel because the gas station pumps don't work, you have no lights, unless of course you have flashlights and batteries and things like that, which you should have, but also the food stamps don't work, retail transactions don't work, ATMs don't work, the banks can't process transactions, and there are over 40 million people in America who depend on food stamps.
[03:27:04.282 --> 03:27:07.583]  40 million people who probably have done nothing to prepare.
[03:27:08.143 --> 03:27:12.324]  They've depended on the government to allow them to eat every day.
[03:27:12.884 --> 03:27:18.525]  And they go cash in those food stamps every day to get, I don't know, Doritos or Pop-Tarts or whatever they're buying with that.
[03:27:18.865 --> 03:27:20.025]  Garbage sodas, you know?
[03:27:21.065 --> 03:27:23.706]  What happens when those 40 million people don't have those food stamps?
[03:27:24.706 --> 03:27:25.526]  They go berserk.
[03:27:26.046 --> 03:27:26.906]  They go crazy.
[03:27:27.346 --> 03:27:30.847]  Without electricity, cities like Los Angeles are not survivable.
[03:27:31.505 --> 03:27:32.246]  By most people.
[03:27:32.646 --> 03:27:36.128]  In fact, some of these liberal cities are barely survivable today.
[03:27:36.509 --> 03:27:46.496]  Just because of the decay and the destitution and the collapse pushed by liberal policies, you've got typhoid, an 18th century disease out of control in Los Angeles.
[03:27:47.056 --> 03:27:49.958]  Needles and feces in the streets of San Francisco.
[03:27:50.579 --> 03:27:53.641]  Homelessness and substance abuse rampant across Seattle.
[03:27:53.661 --> 03:27:56.343]  The city is in a state of accelerating collapse.
[03:27:56.843 --> 03:27:59.265]  Add to that a power grid failure,
[03:27:59.969 --> 03:28:07.831]  That's a recipe for a total collapse, complete lawlessness, and a Mad Max scenario, at least temporarily, in those cities.
[03:28:08.391 --> 03:28:12.373]  Do not be caught in those cities when that unfolds.
[03:28:12.433 --> 03:28:14.173]  That is my warning to you today.
[03:28:14.833 --> 03:28:16.754]  Do not be caught in a city.
[03:28:17.622 --> 03:28:18.762]  And there will be no warning time.
[03:28:19.102 --> 03:28:23.144]  You must relocate out of those worst zones ahead of time if you're not already out.
[03:28:23.604 --> 03:28:25.044]  You need to be outside the inner city.
[03:28:25.565 --> 03:28:26.945]  Get outside the suburbs if you can.
[03:28:27.245 --> 03:28:30.026]  Get to rural America if you can in advance.
[03:28:30.066 --> 03:28:37.548]  Because what's coming, sadly, it's going to involve a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, a lot of desperation.
[03:28:37.568 --> 03:28:44.971]  And even the average American living in Los Angeles has no idea where to find water, where to find food, how to do anything.
[03:28:46.437 --> 03:28:47.158]  The average person.
[03:28:47.478 --> 03:28:51.602]  I know there are some, you know, survivalists who do know that, but that's not the majority.
[03:28:52.183 --> 03:28:53.784]  Much more straight ahead, more analysis coming.
[03:28:53.804 --> 03:28:56.447]  This is Mike Adams here, InfoWars.com.
[03:28:56.467 --> 03:28:58.249]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:29:05.290 --> 03:29:07.971]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:29:08.331 --> 03:29:14.232]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:29:14.753 --> 03:29:26.736]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:29:30.217 --> 03:29:33.958]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!

[03:29:43.829 --> 03:29:49.792]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:29:50.232 --> 03:29:51.673]  Don't let your day slow you down.

[03:30:08.772 --> 03:30:13.415]  We are launching one of the biggest sales ever on these key particular products.
[03:30:13.695 --> 03:30:14.836]  This is a huge sale.

[03:30:51.358 --> 03:30:51.999]  We're good to go.
[03:30:52.019 --> 03:30:52.459]  We're good to go.
[03:30:52.479 --> 03:30:53.039]  We're good to go.
[03:30:53.099 --> 03:30:53.880]  We're good to go.
[03:30:54.040 --> 03:30:55.060]  We're good to go.
[03:30:55.080 --> 03:30:56.001]  We're good to go.

[03:31:02.704 --> 03:31:02.804]  We're
[03:31:06.846 --> 03:31:07.306]  We're good to go!
[03:31:32.185 --> 03:31:36.650]  PowerStack, next to DNA Force Plus, it has the most product in it.
[03:31:36.851 --> 03:31:46.182]  Quite frankly, all my funding problems would be solved if I dumbed the products down, like everybody else does, or almost everybody else does, and then sold stuff for really low prices with almost nothing in them.
[03:31:47.230 --> 03:31:48.891]  Or for higher prices, there's nothing in them.
[03:31:49.691 --> 03:31:53.192]  This new 8-pack PowerStack is 13 pills.
[03:31:53.832 --> 03:31:55.832]  You take half in the morning, half in the evening.
[03:31:55.852 --> 03:32:04.315]  It's got two different nice packets for each day, so that you have what you need in the morning and what you need in the evening, and it's very easy and portable, and you don't forget to use it.
[03:32:04.455 --> 03:32:05.295]  Everything is in there.
[03:32:05.575 --> 03:32:06.275]  It's incredible.
[03:32:06.395 --> 03:32:07.176]  Dr. McCamm's shop.
[03:32:07.196 --> 03:32:07.836]  Please for TV viewers.
[03:32:09.056 --> 03:32:10.997]  And it's got everything in it.
[03:32:11.238 --> 03:32:12.398]  And this way you don't forget it.
[03:32:12.418 --> 03:32:13.519]  This way you can carry it with you.
[03:32:13.639 --> 03:32:17.041]  There is a lot of money that goes in to each one of these boxes.
[03:32:17.241 --> 03:32:18.081]  And they're all in there.
[03:32:18.622 --> 03:32:19.202]  You just boom.
[03:32:19.542 --> 03:32:20.223]  Got your AM.
[03:32:20.683 --> 03:32:21.363]  Got your PM.
[03:32:21.904 --> 03:32:23.444]  It's all right there.
[03:32:23.865 --> 03:32:24.645]  That's our newest product.
[03:32:24.725 --> 03:32:25.746]  I'm very excited about it.
[03:32:25.866 --> 03:32:28.507]  If you're like me, you keep forgetting to take the things you're supposed to take.
[03:32:28.647 --> 03:32:29.408]  It's incredible.
[03:32:29.448 --> 03:32:31.189]  I'm not going to go over everything that's in it.
[03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:33.910]  Flex & Joint Support Energy Kickstart Formula.
[03:32:33.970 --> 03:32:34.891]  Krill Oil Formula.
[03:32:34.991 --> 03:32:42.836]  Neutropic Brain Formula, Green Detox Formula in the AM, the PM, Rest and Recovery, Immune Support Formula, Sound Sleep Formula, Krill Oils.
[03:32:42.856 --> 03:32:43.596]  That's a good day and night.
[03:32:43.676 --> 03:32:44.817]  Bone Support Formula.
[03:32:44.917 --> 03:32:45.297]  Boom!
[03:32:45.397 --> 03:32:45.977]  We're excited.
[03:32:46.157 --> 03:32:46.718]  It's amazing.
[03:32:46.818 --> 03:32:47.718]  Thank you for your support.
[03:32:47.998 --> 03:32:48.979]  50% off so much more.
[03:32:49.099 --> 03:32:50.600]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:33:06.147 --> 03:33:08.869]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.220 --> 03:33:27.325]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.825 --> 03:33:31.088]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:33:33.422 --> 03:33:50.171]  All right, we're going to continue with an analysis of the potential false flag attacks the deep state might unleash to try to change the narrative and of course destroy America, take Trump out of power, and crush the American people, silence all voices of patriotism or nationalism.
[03:33:50.931 --> 03:33:53.733]  Now, what's important to understand in all of this is that
[03:33:54.608 --> 03:33:59.749]  This could blow back on them catastrophically, so allow me to explain how that could happen.
[03:34:00.250 --> 03:34:05.371]  And again, thanks for joining me, Mike Adams, here on the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[03:34:05.911 --> 03:34:13.513]  Now, the desperation of the Deep State means that they could try anything at this point, whatever power they have left.
[03:34:14.053 --> 03:34:16.014]  They know that they are fighting for their survival.
[03:34:16.294 --> 03:34:17.434]  They're going to be exposed.
[03:34:18.223 --> 03:34:27.672]  As time goes on, and many of them are going to prison, and some of them may be declared guilty of actual treason, which could technically carry the death penalty.
[03:34:27.712 --> 03:34:28.092]  Who knows?
[03:34:28.112 --> 03:34:29.434]  We'll see what the courts say.
[03:34:30.154 --> 03:34:34.038]  But they are desperate, so they are willing to unleash absolutely anything.
[03:34:34.699 --> 03:34:37.561]  And you may ask yourself, well, what power do they still have?
[03:34:37.581 --> 03:34:41.205]  Remember when Obama and Eric Holder ran Operation Fast and Furious?
[03:34:41.545 --> 03:34:43.307]  They were putting guns into the hands of
[03:34:43.962 --> 03:34:44.102]  Okay.
[03:35:02.523 --> 03:35:13.692]  That were exploited by the Deep State in order to pass, you know, the Patriot Act or expand the Patriot Act that already existed or expand surveillance powers that have now been weaponized against the people and so on.
[03:35:14.052 --> 03:35:22.039]  So we know that throughout history, the Deep State has, in some cases, been complicit in planning false flag attacks.
[03:35:22.359 --> 03:35:28.224]  And in other cases, they have exploited attacks or allowed them to take place by standing down America's defenses.
[03:35:28.891 --> 03:35:40.637]  And what I find interesting in this is that you go back just a couple of years, the New York Times ran an article about how the FBI would plot domestic terrorism attacks in the United States.
[03:35:41.177 --> 03:35:47.641]  They would recruit homeless people and drug addicts off the streets or find someone of, you know, Arab descent.
[03:35:48.795 --> 03:35:50.938]  And they would pay them 50 bucks.
[03:35:50.998 --> 03:35:52.020]  Here, get in this van.
[03:35:52.080 --> 03:35:52.921]  Drive this van.
[03:35:52.941 --> 03:35:56.386]  And they would tell them that they're going to blow up the Cleveland Bridge, for example.
[03:35:56.426 --> 03:35:57.187]  That's an actual case.
[03:35:57.207 --> 03:36:02.655]  They found a bunch of homeless meth heads to take part in this FBI plot to blow up the Cleveland Bridge.
[03:36:03.829 --> 03:36:05.730]  And, or a bridge in Cleveland.
[03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:13.975]  And of course the FBI then stops the terrorist attack at the last minute, and then issues a press release, oh we stopped terrorism!
[03:36:14.495 --> 03:36:21.199]  No, actually the FBI has been running around the country plotting the terrorism acts, and that's not just me saying that.
[03:36:21.899 --> 03:36:25.441]  Again, that's the liberal media has been saying that for years!
[03:36:26.182 --> 03:36:30.684]  I think even the Kansas City Star did a big story on that a few years ago, if I'm not mistaken.
[03:36:30.704 --> 03:36:31.885]  It's a well-known tactic.
[03:36:32.768 --> 03:36:53.844]  Point is that we know that Obama's Deep State, which included the FBI and the DOJ and other Deep State operations, they have the means and they have experience at plotting domestic terrorism, bombings, drone attacks, even using radiological dirty bombs deployed by drones.
[03:36:54.604 --> 03:36:55.465]  They were part of
[03:36:56.678 --> 03:37:01.701]  I believe they were part of one drone attack that could have been deployed against the White House, for example.
[03:37:01.741 --> 03:37:02.982]  I may have to fact check that.
[03:37:03.062 --> 03:37:04.724]  My memory may be a little shady on that one.
[03:37:05.324 --> 03:37:12.429]  But we know the FBI has engaged in many other attacks, many other, you know, simulated attacks that they stopped at the last minute.
[03:37:13.169 --> 03:37:18.833]  So, and the FBI would tell you, well, they were using fake bombs, they were using fake explosives, they wouldn't really blow up.
[03:37:19.834 --> 03:37:24.477]  Well, how hard is it for these desperate deep state people to replace their fake bombs with real bombs?
[03:37:25.057 --> 03:37:25.938]  Not difficult at all.
[03:37:26.658 --> 03:37:35.742]  And they have proven that certain elements within the FBI have proven that they are, in fact, a domestic terrorism enemy of the state.
[03:37:35.802 --> 03:37:39.183]  I'm talking about the James Comey people and those loyal to James Comey.
[03:37:39.463 --> 03:37:40.603]  They are enemies of America.
[03:37:40.623 --> 03:37:42.104]  It's not the entire FBI.
[03:37:42.504 --> 03:37:44.785]  I know retired FBI agents who are good people.
[03:37:44.805 --> 03:37:47.026]  There's a lot of good men and women in the FBI.
[03:37:47.406 --> 03:37:48.526]  There's still patriots in there.
[03:37:49.327 --> 03:37:52.468]  But certain sectors of it, certain fringe sectors,
[03:37:53.687 --> 03:37:53.988]  All right.
[03:38:09.611 --> 03:38:17.296]  That would give Trump the ability to declare nationwide martial law in the aftermath of an attempted major attack.
[03:38:17.396 --> 03:38:19.817]  You know, something on the scale of 9-11 or bigger.
[03:38:20.398 --> 03:38:23.499]  An attempted deep state bombing of the LA port.
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:25.601]  I keep coming back to the Los Angeles port.
[03:38:26.201 --> 03:38:33.303]  Because it's very easy for them to arrange to have a nuclear weapon, you know, snuck into the port on a container ship, for example.
[03:38:33.804 --> 03:38:36.925]  Even a dirty bomb in a container, a 40-foot shipping container.
[03:38:37.225 --> 03:38:40.066]  That's not difficult for them to pull off, and they hate America.
[03:38:40.946 --> 03:38:45.707]  The only thing is, I think, they don't want to destroy California, so they may choose some other port.
[03:38:46.108 --> 03:38:49.629]  If they could find a port, you know, that Trump liked or something, maybe they would target that.
[03:38:49.669 --> 03:38:50.469]  These are evil people.
[03:38:50.849 --> 03:38:51.449]  They're insane.
[03:38:51.729 --> 03:38:52.430]  They're psychopaths.
[03:38:52.490 --> 03:38:53.250]  They will try anything.
[03:38:53.993 --> 03:38:56.596]  But in the aftermath of that, Trump could declare martial law.
[03:38:58.057 --> 03:39:11.851]  And in that scenario, he could then, under that martial law, go ahead and invoke the arrests of the Deep State traitors, have military police go out and seek out a whole list of people to be arrested.
[03:39:12.628 --> 03:39:15.809]  Who have committed treason, who have been complicit in this attempted coup.
[03:39:15.829 --> 03:39:21.871]  And those people, in my view, include specific governors, certain mayors of sanctuary cities.
[03:39:21.891 --> 03:39:31.415]  They include certain treasonous district judges who have been engaged in this judicial supremacy, trying to make sure that America is overrun and destroyed from within.
[03:39:32.155 --> 03:39:39.578]  There are terrorist recruiters who are posing as college professors in certain universities in California who need to be arrested.
[03:39:40.402 --> 03:39:49.689]  There are people posing as journalists who have been working for mainstream media outlets who are actual traitors, domestic enemies.
[03:39:49.769 --> 03:39:57.094]  They have carried out acts of not just sedition, but treason against America and they would need to be on that arrest list as well.
[03:39:57.554 --> 03:39:59.435]  There are a lot of people who should be on that list.
[03:40:00.496 --> 03:40:05.440]  So you know how everything the Deep State has tried over the last few years has blown up in their own faces?
[03:40:06.180 --> 03:40:08.642]  They never expected to get caught with this Russia collusion hoax.
[03:40:09.770 --> 03:40:16.533]  They never expected Robert Mueller to issue a report that said, well, we don't have any evidence that Trump actually committed a crime.
[03:40:17.534 --> 03:40:24.777]  They never expected the American people to outvote the Hillary Clinton vote fraud machine and elect Donald Trump to the presidency.
[03:40:25.458 --> 03:40:27.839]  The deep state has never expected to be caught.
[03:40:28.419 --> 03:40:36.763]  They have always seen themselves as above the law and never, they've never seen themselves as needing to be held accountable to anything.
[03:40:37.409 --> 03:40:40.430]  And they have always thought that they would get away with everything.
[03:40:40.470 --> 03:40:44.250]  And that's why they are so shocked by what's happening right now.
[03:40:44.270 --> 03:40:45.511]  And that's why they are so desperate.
[03:40:45.771 --> 03:40:49.291]  And I think that's why they are going to overshoot this as well.
[03:40:50.032 --> 03:40:51.152]  They're going to overshoot this.
[03:40:51.192 --> 03:40:55.133]  They're going to, I believe, attempt to carry out a massive false flag.
[03:40:55.593 --> 03:40:56.893]  It's got a boomerang against them.
[03:40:57.473 --> 03:40:58.253]  They're going to get caught.
[03:40:58.673 --> 03:40:59.653]  They're going to get exposed.
[03:41:00.214 --> 03:41:07.095]  And the president may even use that to go after the Deep State people, have them arrested, have them held for military tribunals.
[03:41:07.850 --> 03:41:11.571]  While all patriots cheer as we take our country back.
[03:41:12.291 --> 03:41:28.075]  And any left-wing domestic terrorism group that takes to the streets and tries to stop that process from happening, tries to stop the restoration of the rule of law in America, I believe at this point would be met and engaged by American patriots who are defending their nation.
[03:41:28.675 --> 03:41:30.215]  And this is as it should be.
[03:41:31.195 --> 03:41:33.256]  This is, I mean, I should say,
[03:41:34.478 --> 03:41:37.019]  Stopping the treason is as it should be.
[03:41:37.099 --> 03:41:39.139]  None of us want to see any of the violence.
[03:41:39.159 --> 03:41:40.459]  We don't want to see the false flags.
[03:41:41.020 --> 03:41:43.920]  We don't want to see this lawlessness that the left has been pushing.
[03:41:44.260 --> 03:41:45.441]  We just want our country back.
[03:41:45.721 --> 03:41:47.021]  We want our First Amendment back.
[03:41:47.361 --> 03:41:48.561]  We want our Second Amendment back.
[03:41:48.581 --> 03:41:50.042]  We want our religious freedom back.
[03:41:50.902 --> 03:41:52.082]  We want our Republic back.
[03:41:53.162 --> 03:41:59.424]  And if those people who are trying to take all that from us, if they are willing to engage in violence, then we will have to meet.
[03:42:00.251 --> 03:42:01.432]  And stop that violence.
[03:42:01.872 --> 03:42:24.008]  We will have to defend our country in whatever legal and lawful way is possible to support those forces that are invoked by President Trump, whether it be National Guard, whether it be military police, whether it be local law enforcement, those forces that are attempting to restore liberty, to defend our nation and defend our borders.
[03:42:24.589 --> 03:42:29.072]  And we should only hope that Trump would call for, in fact, the militia to defend the borders.
[03:42:29.864 --> 03:42:36.967]  The militia is the constitutional self-defense immune system of America.
[03:42:36.987 --> 03:42:39.769]  And there are hundreds of thousands of people who are ready to defend this country.
[03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:43.671]  They're just waiting for the right authorization, so to speak.
[03:42:43.731 --> 03:42:47.212]  Not that they necessarily need it, but they are waiting patiently to see if it's going to happen.
[03:42:48.233 --> 03:42:49.493]  But that's my analysis so far.
[03:42:49.653 --> 03:42:50.554]  One more segment coming up.
[03:42:50.574 --> 03:42:52.995]  We'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:53.015 --> 03:42:53.775]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:42:53.855 --> 03:42:54.296]  Stay with me.
[03:42:54.476 --> 03:42:54.956]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:24.147 --> 03:43:25.127]  You have heard the evidence.
[03:43:25.147 --> 03:43:25.328]  Guilty.
[03:43:25.808 --> 03:43:25.968]  Guilty.
[03:43:25.988 --> 03:43:26.128]  Guilty.

[03:43:31.050 --> 03:43:31.210]  Guilty.
[03:43:31.250 --> 03:43:31.390]  Guilty.
[03:43:31.410 --> 03:43:31.630]  Guilty.
[03:43:32.791 --> 03:43:32.931]  Guilty.
[03:43:32.951 --> 03:43:33.091]  Guilty.
[03:43:33.131 --> 03:43:33.391]  Guilty.
[03:43:33.411 --> 03:43:35.312]  Guilty.
[03:43:35.372 --> 03:43:35.492]  Guilty.
[03:43:35.512 --> 03:43:35.652]  Guilty.

[03:43:43.235 --> 03:43:43.355]  Guilty.
[03:43:43.375 --> 03:43:43.515]  Guilty
[03:43:48.146 --> 03:43:50.987]  They're creating a world government, a mark of the beast.
[03:43:51.007 --> 03:43:53.468]  2.2 billion people just got told they can't use certain words.
[03:43:53.668 --> 03:43:57.109]  They're announcing giant CNN array works, but everyone on the internet knows this.
[03:43:57.129 --> 03:44:00.050]  These people are not freaking humans, okay?
[03:44:00.450 --> 03:44:02.411]  Hillary Clinton is a goddamned...
[03:44:04.529 --> 03:44:06.572]  They're taking my Megatanks!
[03:44:06.632 --> 03:44:09.035]  They're taking Uber from everybody!
[03:44:09.075 --> 03:44:10.777]  They're taking everything from me!
[03:44:10.817 --> 03:44:16.403]  I don't like them putting genitals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[03:44:16.463 --> 03:44:17.985]  I'm sick of being social engineered!
[03:44:18.105 --> 03:44:18.646]  It's not funny!
[03:44:20.274 --> 03:44:22.656]  You care about the real American s**t, or you don't.
[03:44:23.096 --> 03:44:24.897]  And if you do, it goes for every side.
[03:44:25.057 --> 03:44:28.680]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[03:44:28.980 --> 03:44:38.426]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSM outlets cheering on the rape.
[03:44:39.107 --> 03:44:49.474]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous CEO, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[03:44:50.214 --> 03:45:01.884]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[03:45:03.382 --> 03:45:12.265]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:45:12.465 --> 03:45:21.267]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:45:21.447 --> 03:45:22.167]  It's ridiculous.
[03:45:22.288 --> 03:45:22.728]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[03:45:23.988 --> 03:45:27.250]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[03:45:27.490 --> 03:45:32.893]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic's expensive.
[03:45:32.993 --> 03:45:35.114]  This is the organically derived.
[03:45:35.514 --> 03:45:36.435]  This is the real stuff.
[03:45:36.615 --> 03:45:46.500]  I want to warn you, though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there where it cut off.
[03:45:46.720 --> 03:45:48.101]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[03:45:48.121 --> 03:45:49.762]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:45:50.502 --> 03:45:51.423]  And then tore it off.
[03:45:51.463 --> 03:45:52.923]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:45:53.043 --> 03:45:55.204]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:45:55.404 --> 03:45:56.965]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:45:57.005 --> 03:45:58.506]  First it tingled, and it came back.
[03:45:58.686 --> 03:45:59.766]  I was like, this is incredible.
[03:45:59.826 --> 03:46:00.647]  But I'm going to warn you.
[03:46:00.847 --> 03:46:05.389]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:46:05.569 --> 03:46:09.330]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[03:46:09.530 --> 03:46:11.851]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[03:46:12.092 --> 03:46:13.872]  So it's the building blocks.
[03:46:14.132 --> 03:46:15.053]  And it's the next level.
[03:46:15.093 --> 03:46:16.033]  It's the best you're going to get.
[03:46:16.153 --> 03:46:18.915]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[03:46:18.955 --> 03:46:19.735]  We're getting into supplements.
[03:46:19.975 --> 03:46:21.797]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[03:46:21.957 --> 03:46:27.163]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:46:27.363 --> 03:46:31.889]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[03:46:32.209 --> 03:46:33.851]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[03:46:35.152 --> 03:46:39.313]  Make it up 150%, then we discount it 20-30% down to $119.
[03:46:39.513 --> 03:46:43.094]  They're still, again, most of the cost is the product.
[03:46:43.214 --> 03:46:44.214]  It's 20% off.
[03:46:44.334 --> 03:46:46.615]  Profitably make funds this operation.
[03:46:46.635 --> 03:46:50.256]  97% reviews, 4.7 power views, third party.
[03:46:50.396 --> 03:46:52.276]  Please, go read the reviews for yourself.
[03:46:52.536 --> 03:46:54.937]  DNA Force Plus, InfoWarStore.com.
[03:46:55.037 --> 03:46:56.837]  It costs a lot because it's worth a lot.
[03:46:56.977 --> 03:46:57.717]  It's next level.
[03:46:57.817 --> 03:46:59.138]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:46:59.418 --> 03:47:01.038]  Fueling the human revolution.
[03:47:06.099 --> 03:47:08.841]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.265 --> 03:47:24.031]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:24.772 --> 03:47:29.555]  I want to tell you how much I appreciate all your support, all your love and prayers.
[03:47:30.482 --> 03:47:46.788]  I've had more people come up to me recently in public and just thank me for what we are doing, all of us who are independent media, patriots, pro-America, Trump supporters, people who defend life and liberty and health and happiness, and it's been really interesting.
[03:47:46.828 --> 03:47:56.751]  I've just had, for some reason, people keep walking up to me now, maybe I've been out in public more, you know, not at any announced places because that can be dangerous, but just
[03:47:57.503 --> 03:47:59.845]  I was in the airport in Houston last week.
[03:47:59.885 --> 03:48:00.805]  A couple came up to me.
[03:48:00.825 --> 03:48:01.726]  I was in a restaurant.
[03:48:01.766 --> 03:48:02.726]  A couple came up to me.
[03:48:02.747 --> 03:48:04.848]  I was shopping in Austin.
[03:48:04.868 --> 03:48:05.648]  A couple came up to me.
[03:48:05.668 --> 03:48:07.770]  I was like, people love what we're doing.
[03:48:08.530 --> 03:48:11.512]  And we've got fans even all throughout Whole Foods, by the way.
[03:48:12.053 --> 03:48:13.994]  Walking, like shopping for organics.
[03:48:14.074 --> 03:48:15.395]  And yeah, we love America.
[03:48:15.455 --> 03:48:16.315]  Defend the borders.
[03:48:17.016 --> 03:48:17.876]  Eat organic food.
[03:48:17.916 --> 03:48:20.278]  Stay healthy so we can stay alive and defend this nation.
[03:48:20.942 --> 03:48:23.524]  You know, not everybody fits into a nice little box.
[03:48:23.544 --> 03:48:27.987]  You know, you should eat organic, you should be healthy, because you're going to need your health for what's coming.
[03:48:28.467 --> 03:48:38.413]  Now speaking to that, by the way, as martial law unfolds, which I believe is going to happen, I think Trump will at some point invoke the Insurrection Act.
[03:48:38.813 --> 03:48:40.434]  It seems to be the most likely scenario, it's not 100%.
[03:48:41.675 --> 03:48:45.878]  But when it happens, I really want to encourage you, all of us,
[03:48:46.923 --> 03:48:52.725]  We have got to understand the difference between martial law under Trump versus a martial law under, let's say, Obama.
[03:48:53.385 --> 03:48:59.688]  Martial law under a Democrat is a dangerous, fascist police state that doesn't respect your liberties.
[03:49:00.508 --> 03:49:09.792]  Martial law under Trump is Trump trying to arrest the deep state traitors and reestablish the rule of law and ultimately hand America back to the people.
[03:49:10.832 --> 03:49:16.234]  We should support that limited martial law action, those military police arrests of the traitors under Trump.
[03:49:16.846 --> 03:49:20.067]  I mean the traitors ordered, these actions ordered by Trump.
[03:49:20.247 --> 03:49:22.888]  The arrest of traitors who were working under Obama.
[03:49:22.908 --> 03:49:25.188]  I just want to be clear on what I'm saying here.
[03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:27.849]  Trump is trying to go to battle with the traitors.
[03:49:27.889 --> 03:49:29.190]  We need to support him in this effort.
[03:49:30.170 --> 03:49:35.091]  So what that means is if you see troops on the streets, you need to understand these are friendlies.
[03:49:36.292 --> 03:49:38.232]  These are for the most part patriots.
[03:49:38.612 --> 03:49:41.933]  National Guard troops are you and me.
[03:49:42.013 --> 03:49:42.934]  It's we the people.
[03:49:43.234 --> 03:49:44.274]  A lot of listeners to this
[03:49:45.795 --> 03:49:47.176]  They're part of the National Guard.
[03:49:47.736 --> 03:49:50.438]  A lot of the listeners to this are part of law enforcement.
[03:49:50.898 --> 03:49:52.839]  They're part of active duty military.
[03:49:53.759 --> 03:50:00.222]  Or they may be recalled up because they're currently retired military, but they could be reactivated, by the way, by the President.
[03:50:00.802 --> 03:50:02.483]  We need to support this effort.
[03:50:03.684 --> 03:50:04.924]  It's a big difference.
[03:50:05.225 --> 03:50:12.128]  I mean, troops on the streets, under the Insurrection Act, under the order of President Trump, to
[03:50:13.084 --> 03:50:17.265]  Arrest the actual traitors who tried to carry out treason against this nation.
[03:50:17.625 --> 03:50:22.586]  An open rebellion where they're trying to sweep in a communist revolution and take out our republic?
[03:50:23.247 --> 03:50:33.489]  You should be thankful that the President has the courage to order limited martial law, insurrection act, National Guard troops to go out and seek out those arrests.
[03:50:33.569 --> 03:50:39.851]  You should be cheering, you should be waving American flags as this is happening because it's a necessary step to take our country back.
[03:50:41.371 --> 03:50:43.192]  So be friendly to these people.
[03:50:43.573 --> 03:50:44.413]  Be respectful.
[03:50:44.894 --> 03:50:46.795]  Understand that they're putting their lives on the line.
[03:50:47.355 --> 03:50:48.156]  Their lives are at risk.
[03:50:48.196 --> 03:50:53.840]  And let's hope that they don't go door-to-door and try to confiscate weapons, because that's not going to go over very, very good with anybody.
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:58.703]  I don't know about you, but I'm not giving up my rifle to anybody.
[03:50:58.723 --> 03:51:00.385]  I don't care if you're wearing a uniform or not.
[03:51:00.485 --> 03:51:02.206]  I have the right to keep and bear arms, period.
[03:51:03.078 --> 03:51:05.860]  You need to go on down the road and keep on going.
[03:51:06.021 --> 03:51:06.601]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:51:06.801 --> 03:51:07.982]  But then again, I live out in the country.
[03:51:08.282 --> 03:51:09.103]  They're not going to bother me.
[03:51:09.504 --> 03:51:11.065]  And if you live in the country, they're not going to bother you.
[03:51:11.105 --> 03:51:12.726]  This is all going to be focused in the cities.
[03:51:13.827 --> 03:51:16.590]  Are they going to go door to door in the cities and confiscate weapons?
[03:51:16.650 --> 03:51:17.110]  I hope not.
[03:51:17.831 --> 03:51:19.732]  But I do hope they go arrest the traitors.
[03:51:20.733 --> 03:51:25.717]  And I hope they have a list of hundreds of traitors to be arrested because that's exactly what needs to happen.
[03:51:25.757 --> 03:51:26.338]  My point is,
[03:51:27.580 --> 03:51:33.645]  We've all had a long history of kind of freaking out when we see troops or troop transports.
[03:51:34.246 --> 03:51:35.747]  These are Americans, people!
[03:51:36.287 --> 03:51:43.794]  What you should be freaking out about is if it's United Nations, armored personnel carriers, blue helmets invading America.
[03:51:43.834 --> 03:51:45.775]  Yeah, that's invasion.
[03:51:46.316 --> 03:51:46.576]  Okay?
[03:51:46.856 --> 03:51:49.458]  That's something to resist.
[03:51:49.899 --> 03:51:52.681]  I mean, the Founding Fathers gave you permission to resist that.
[03:51:53.380 --> 03:52:01.489]  If there's an invasion in Texas or New Mexico or anywhere, if there's a land invasion, if there's, you know, 5,000 U.N.
[03:52:01.529 --> 03:52:06.975]  troops coming into the country and starting to kill Americans, you don't need to wait for orders from headquarters.
[03:52:07.735 --> 03:52:10.919]  You don't need to wait for President Trump to say anything.
[03:52:11.099 --> 03:52:12.460]  They're shooting Americans.
[03:52:13.221 --> 03:52:13.922]  You go after them.
[03:52:14.628 --> 03:52:16.209]  You activate the Second Amendment defense.
[03:52:16.669 --> 03:52:19.331]  You show them that America is not a place to be overrun.
[03:52:19.671 --> 03:52:23.413]  America is not going to surrender to your globalist agenda, Mr. Obama.
[03:52:24.093 --> 03:52:25.674]  America is going to defend itself.
[03:52:25.734 --> 03:52:27.095]  America has a Second Amendment.
[03:52:27.736 --> 03:52:32.078]  And president or no president, our founding fathers already gave us permission to defend this country.
[03:52:32.098 --> 03:52:33.239]  It's called the Second Amendment.
[03:52:33.959 --> 03:52:37.261]  And if for some reason the deep state manages to take out President Trump,
[03:52:38.371 --> 03:52:40.512]  Right there, that's an activation of the Second Amendment.
[03:52:40.953 --> 03:52:43.494]  That's practically just granting you permission.
[03:52:43.654 --> 03:52:47.217]  It's time to take the country back because the coup is on.
[03:52:47.577 --> 03:52:48.638]  They assassinate Trump.
[03:52:48.758 --> 03:52:51.299]  That's an act of war against America.
[03:52:51.860 --> 03:52:58.064]  And let us pray that Trump will be protected and that they will not successfully take him out, even though they've tried many, many times.
[03:52:59.385 --> 03:53:03.227]  We know that actually there is divine influence in this right now.
[03:53:03.267 --> 03:53:07.770]  We know that Trump has had some level of divine protection and we know that
[03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:16.335]  You know how they say God doesn't always choose a perfect person to carry out God's will, but God will choose someone who's perfect for the job.
[03:53:16.675 --> 03:53:17.115]  That's Trump.
[03:53:17.475 --> 03:53:18.456]  He's not a perfect person.
[03:53:18.556 --> 03:53:19.297]  He's a human being.
[03:53:19.657 --> 03:53:23.059]  He's made mistakes in his personal life, you know, throughout the years.
[03:53:23.259 --> 03:53:23.599]  Whatever.
[03:53:23.659 --> 03:53:24.260]  Everybody has.
[03:53:24.940 --> 03:53:30.243]  But Trump's the perfect person to go against this deep state because he just, he won't take any more bull from these people.
[03:53:30.824 --> 03:53:33.185]  He just says enough is enough and he goes to battle with them.
[03:53:33.205 --> 03:53:34.726]  And that's what God wants for America.
[03:53:35.771 --> 03:53:40.713]  And the fact that we are fighting back against the murder of unborn babies and even born babies.
[03:53:41.833 --> 03:53:48.475]  Missouri now has just passed, I think, a law that outlaws abortion after eight weeks, I believe it is, the Heartbeat Law.
[03:53:49.035 --> 03:53:49.495]  Missouri.
[03:53:50.135 --> 03:53:50.996]  That's unexpected.
[03:53:51.696 --> 03:53:57.218]  I would have thought maybe this would come from other states first, but, you know, Missouri has just done that, and that's to its credit.
[03:53:57.898 --> 03:53:58.338]  It's time.
[03:53:59.116 --> 03:53:59.976]  To stop?
[03:54:00.296 --> 03:54:01.877]  I mean, I can't believe I have to say this.
[03:54:02.037 --> 03:54:03.957]  Yes, it's time to stop murdering babies in our country.
[03:54:04.497 --> 03:54:07.658]  It's time to stop murdering babies before they're born and after they're born.
[03:54:08.538 --> 03:54:10.139]  Do we have to say that that's wrong?
[03:54:10.859 --> 03:54:13.720]  Do we have to say that violence against children is wrong?
[03:54:14.320 --> 03:54:17.761]  The left is running around saying that a pregnant mother is not even a mother.
[03:54:18.581 --> 03:54:21.062]  They're running around saying an unborn baby isn't a human.
[03:54:22.042 --> 03:54:22.982]  What do they think it is?
[03:54:28.148 --> 03:54:28.548]  A lizard?
[03:54:29.149 --> 03:54:33.092]  What is in their minds that they think an unborn baby is, if not human?
[03:54:33.512 --> 03:54:38.996]  See, they are insane, and they're just insane enough to try to take over this country.
[03:54:39.957 --> 03:54:45.602]  They're gonna try a massive communist takeover, a cultural revolution type of event.
[03:54:45.622 --> 03:54:46.943]  They're gonna try false flags.
[03:54:47.283 --> 03:54:48.884]  They're gonna try all kinds of crazy stuff.
[03:54:49.585 --> 03:54:54.889]  You and I, what we need to do, just to summarize this whole show, is support our president,
[03:54:55.842 --> 03:55:02.968]  Be patient with the process that's happening with William Barr, who I have some faith in for now.
[03:55:03.008 --> 03:55:04.089]  We're going to watch him closely.
[03:55:04.129 --> 03:55:07.752]  I don't have blind faith in William Barr, but so far he's done some good stuff.
[03:55:07.792 --> 03:55:08.953]  Let's see if he carries this out.
[03:55:10.814 --> 03:55:17.940]  He sure is better than the previous Attorney General that we had there, who was complicit in the cover-up, by the way.
[03:55:19.831 --> 03:55:27.033]  Support our president, have faith in the process, but be ready to be activated in defense of your nation and the rule of law.
[03:55:27.573 --> 03:55:35.255]  Be ready to support Trump's defense against the enemies of this nation, whatever Trump invokes.
[03:55:35.455 --> 03:55:39.816]  Insurrection Act, military police arrests, limited martial law in certain areas.
[03:55:40.296 --> 03:55:45.037]  We need your support, and the president needs to know that you support him in those efforts.
[03:55:45.638 --> 03:55:47.018]  These are strange times, folks.
[03:55:47.802 --> 03:55:50.563]  All the rules that you may have known in the past need to be thrown out the window.
[03:55:50.583 --> 03:55:52.964]  You have to recalibrate to what's happening right now.
[03:55:53.605 --> 03:55:58.527]  Trump has seized control of the executive branch of government through our voting.
[03:55:59.427 --> 03:56:02.148]  He has been gifted that control, is a better way to say it.
[03:56:02.968 --> 03:56:04.049]  He didn't take it by force.
[03:56:04.169 --> 03:56:06.470]  We voted him into office, but as a result,
[03:56:07.290 --> 03:56:15.936]  We have this very narrow, limited opportunity for Trump to use the power of the presidency to defeat the deep state and to take our country back.
[03:56:16.216 --> 03:56:20.879]  And if Trump needs to use the military to get that done, I say, Godspeed.
[03:56:21.380 --> 03:56:23.001]  I say, God bless you, President Trump.
[03:56:23.061 --> 03:56:23.721]  Get that done.
[03:56:24.022 --> 03:56:25.122]  We the people support you.
[03:56:25.503 --> 03:56:34.749]  All of us in Texas, all of us in Arizona, Utah, Florida, even in rural California, Oregon, Washington, all across this country, Idaho, Wyoming, everywhere.
[03:56:35.521 --> 03:56:36.482]  Even on the East Coast as well.
[03:56:36.562 --> 03:56:37.883]  We support you, President Trump.
[03:56:38.223 --> 03:56:39.204]  You do what's necessary.
[03:56:39.544 --> 03:56:40.205]  We'll back you up.
[03:56:40.645 --> 03:56:42.466]  We're going to take our country back one way or another.
[03:56:43.347 --> 03:56:50.272]  We just hope to do it in the most lawful, the most peaceful way possible.
[03:56:50.292 --> 03:56:51.313]  And that's why we have patience.
[03:56:51.333 --> 03:56:55.396]  And that's why we're holding back and waiting for our president and our attorney general to get this done.
[03:56:56.257 --> 03:56:58.418]  We support you in what it takes to get this done.
[03:56:58.438 --> 03:56:59.659]  I hope that makes sense.
[03:57:00.820 --> 03:57:03.262]  So we will stay on the air here as long as we can.
[03:57:03.925 --> 03:57:05.946]  We need your support at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:06.346 --> 03:57:07.786]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:08.286 --> 03:57:11.147]  Thank you for all your support of me and my work as well.
[03:57:11.227 --> 03:57:12.967]  NaturalNews.com is my website.
[03:57:13.447 --> 03:57:14.428]  We're going to stay on the air.
[03:57:14.708 --> 03:57:15.488]  They can censor us.
[03:57:15.528 --> 03:57:16.308]  They can threaten us.
[03:57:16.328 --> 03:57:18.109]  They can try everything to take us offline.
[03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:19.229]  Economic sabotage.
[03:57:19.469 --> 03:57:20.009]  But you know what?
[03:57:20.409 --> 03:57:21.349]  We're still here.
[03:57:21.809 --> 03:57:22.710]  We're still alive.
[03:57:22.950 --> 03:57:24.330]  We're still fighting for America.
[03:57:24.670 --> 03:57:27.991]  We're fighting for you and your liberties and your freedom and your children.
[03:57:28.576 --> 03:57:41.448]  And we're going to continue to do this with every breath that we have, with every bit of energy that we have, and we're going to stay healthy and alive because we're into good nutrition and good, organic, clean, you know, food, by the way.
[03:57:41.468 --> 03:57:45.192]  We're going to be around a long time, and we're going to keep fighting for America every day.
[03:57:45.252 --> 03:57:46.153]  Thank you for joining me today.
[03:57:46.173 --> 03:57:48.935]  Mike Adams here, Health Ranger for InfoWars.com.
[03:57:55.072 --> 03:57:58.497]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[03:57:58.798 --> 03:58:00.140]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[03:58:00.180 --> 03:58:01.021]  This is my favorite.
[03:58:01.041 --> 03:58:03.585]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[03:58:03.965 --> 03:58:04.887]  I mean, really, it's true.
[03:58:04.927 --> 03:58:07.971]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[03:58:08.111 --> 03:58:09.974]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[03:58:10.154 --> 03:58:13.095]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[03:58:13.195 --> 03:58:17.076]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before with these two here.
[03:58:17.096 --> 03:58:21.677]  I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working at the end of doing a broadcast.
[03:58:21.757 --> 03:58:23.037]  I have the energy to go to a gym.
[03:58:23.117 --> 03:58:26.618]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[03:58:26.658 --> 03:58:27.419]  It's heartbreaking.
[03:58:27.479 --> 03:58:29.699]  The super male vitality is about to go away.
[03:58:29.739 --> 03:58:32.960]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[03:58:33.080 --> 03:58:34.361]  Yeah, but that's what it's all about.
[03:58:34.381 --> 03:58:35.582]  This is the real deal.
[03:58:35.622 --> 03:58:39.324]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day, and all of a sudden it's like, whoa!
[03:58:39.544 --> 03:58:40.365]  I'm a man again!
[03:58:40.605 --> 03:58:45.769]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[03:58:45.829 --> 03:58:46.449]  It's back!
[03:58:46.829 --> 03:58:49.471]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[03:58:49.611 --> 03:58:54.394]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[03:58:54.534 --> 03:58:56.856]  Everybody loves everything in the InfoWars store.
[03:58:56.976 --> 03:58:58.597]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[03:58:58.717 --> 03:58:59.718]  You're supporting the show.
