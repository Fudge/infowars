[00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:14.030]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.174]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:27.629]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.450]  Why not?
[00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:30.411]  Minus what?
[00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.553]  Minus what?
[00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:34.314]  I have second thoughts about everything.
[00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:39.097]  We'll have the right to, if I want.
[00:00:39.257 --> 00:00:41.179]  I could declare a national emergency.
[00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:46.363]  I think when they steal and take out and intellectual property theft,
[00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:54.106]  Anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion dollars a year, and well, we have a total loss of almost a trillion dollars a year.
[00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.108]  For many years this has been going on.
[00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:58.548]  In many ways, it's an emergency.
[00:00:58.608 --> 00:00:59.889]  I have no plan right now.
[00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.210]  Actually, we're getting along very well with China right now.
[00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.750]  We're talking.
[00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:05.391]  I think they want to make a deal much more than I do.
[00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:07.713]  I'm getting a lot of money in tariffs.
[00:01:07.773 --> 00:01:09.033]  It's coming in by the billions.
[00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:10.654]  We never got 10 cents from China.
[00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:14.616]  So we'll see what happens, but we are talking to China very seriously.
[00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.274]  Well, I didn't used to have this problem 20 years ago, 25 years ago on air.
[00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:43.256]  I had plenty to cover.
[00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:48.780]  But my head wasn't spinning at the start of each broadcast like it is right now.
[00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:50.502]  Where to start?
[00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:52.263]  Where to begin?
[00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:59.829]  I think the biggest thing we're looking at right now is just the abject absurdity.
[00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.431]  Really, the word is absurd.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:32.438]  That the corporate media in this country and around the world is openly siding against capitalism and against our own nations and against our president and with the communist Chinese and to add insult to injury are running around trying to dynamite our economy publicly and admitting they are
[00:02:34.102 --> 00:02:40.764]  And saying that they're doing it to punish us for supporting Trump.
[00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.525]  That's called economic terrorism.
[00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:48.826]  So I was trying to come up with a headline just minutes ago as we were going live.
[00:02:49.507 --> 00:02:50.527]  We always put an article out.
[00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:02.597]  That has the live audio and video feed in it, that kind of states what the main focus, kind of like Drudge will have a big banner headline about what he thinks is most important.
[00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.559]  I usually agree with you, folks like Drudge.
[00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:12.123]  But if you just pull back from all of this, how do you come up with a headline strong enough?
[00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:13.744]  Economic terrorism!
[00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:16.325]  Exclamation point.
[00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:20.208]  MSM sides with China.
[00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:23.359]  Against America at G7.
[00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:28.042]  But then that's not even strong enough.
[00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:36.168]  Because then they're also running around trying to plunge the economy while they're doing that.
[00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.290]  Siding with a foreign power.
[00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:42.433]  Most authoritarian country in world history.
[00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.856]  Doubling the highest kill rates of anybody else.
[00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:47.437]  At least double.
[00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:51.548]  Tripling or quadrupling what Hitler killed.
[00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:54.510]  Doubling what all the other Soviets killed.
[00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.710]  Conservatively.
[00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.812]  It's not debated, the Chi-Coms admit it.
[00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:03.835]  They call the 80 million killed under Mao a mistake.
[00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:05.396]  Oh, we went a little too far.
[00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:10.479]  Most of them just innocent farmers.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.941]  It was a big dream.
[00:04:13.281 --> 00:04:15.803]  David Rockefeller was working with Mao on it.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.241]  Wrote articles in the New York Times bragging how he helped put Mao Zedong in power.
[00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:31.024]  So I just sit back and I see all the stacks of news bashing Christians, bashing conservatives, bashing veterans, bashing capitalism, bashing America, bashing Jesus Christ.
[00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:35.445]  And it's really all just par for the course, isn't it?
[00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:36.745]  It's really all of this.
[00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:38.326]  Because
[00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:45.679]  We've got all these corporate interests allied with China that thought they had America, that thought we were captured.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.084]  Now we're coming back from the dead, and they're crapping all over themselves.
[00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:53.688]  That's why it's hard for me to criticize Trump, even though he's got some big problems.
[00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:57.913]  Because he's for real, and his enemies are real.
[00:04:58.113 --> 00:04:58.994]  And they're your enemies.
[00:04:59.014 --> 00:04:59.634]  They're my enemies.
[00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:01.316]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.336 --> 00:05:01.657]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:06.398]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:09.721]  I've been so busy I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.902]  But it's very exciting.
[00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:13.304]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:05:13.384 --> 00:05:14.845]  It's got all of these benefits.
[00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:15.926]  Too many to mention.
[00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.087]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:18.108]  It's brand new.
[00:05:18.188 --> 00:05:18.969]  People are going to love it.
[00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:21.111]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:22.532]  Exclusively at Inforestore.com.
[00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:23.933]  25% off introductory price.
[00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.733]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:28.854]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:32.735]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:37.776]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:48.878]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:50.998]  It's got the highly sought-after hyaluronic
[00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:53.579]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:34.307]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.748 --> 00:06:40.612]  And despite all the globalists' best actions, we are still on air in defiance to their tyranny.
[00:06:41.813 --> 00:06:43.734]  It is Monday, August 26, 2019.
[00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:51.941]  Our very existence is an outrage to tyrants and criminals and child molesters everywhere.
[00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:54.823]  We believe in a pro-human future.
[00:06:55.697 --> 00:07:00.618]  But I've got a whole flotilla of mainstream news saying the human era is over.
[00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:09.841]  Well, the very same globalist, the CFR, said that the Chinese century, the communist century, was here.
[00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:15.622]  That America was done, but not so fast, my friends.
[00:07:17.863 --> 00:07:18.183]  Okay.
[00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:21.004]  Here's the big takeaway.
[00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:24.085]  And Trump's out there saying the truth.
[00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:24.805]  Telling it like it is.
[00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:26.845]  It's treason.
[00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:29.207]  But it's more than that, it's economic terrorism.
[00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:54.308]  We have the entire corporate media, and their cheerleaders, in late night so-called comedy that poses newsmen, from Stephen Colbert to Bill Maher, running around foaming at the mouth, saying, we're going into recession, it's all over, run for the hill, slit your wrist, and jump off a cliff, the bubble's too big, look at the size of that thing!
[00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:23.266]  And then you pull back and really assess what's going on, and then you see MSM, the fake news, the enemy of the people at the G7 in France, openly siding with all these foreign governments and the Chai Koms and Iran against the
[00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:26.161]  United States.
[00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:32.004]  So they're not just cheerleading and running around creating hysteria to try to crash the stock market.
[00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:36.905]  That's economic terrorism.
[00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:43.628]  They're doing it with a foreign government and a combine of corporations in coordination.
[00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:45.849]  That's called economic warfare.
[00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:50.751]  So they're using economic terrorism for foreign powers in economic warfare
[00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.742]  That's not hyperbole, that is THE definition.
[00:08:55.122 --> 00:09:16.666]  Then they've got political terrorism going on, saying that if you don't vote Democrat and if you don't vote Trump out, we're going to bully you, we're going to physically attack you, we're not going to let you sit in a restaurant, we're not going to let you drive down the street, we're going to key your car, we're going to fire you from your job, we're going to hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[00:09:18.506 --> 00:09:19.046]  And the rhetoric
[00:09:20.657 --> 00:09:24.519]  Trump is only getting more insane.
[00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.121]  So Trump has come out and tweeted about this.
[00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:28.121]  He's talked about this.
[00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:36.706]  And then RealClearPolitics and others asked, well, can the mainstream media crash the economy?
[00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:38.067]  Well, they're sure as hell trying.
[00:09:39.407 --> 00:09:40.528]  Now, let's explain something.
[00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:43.590]  It's true that we're on top of bubble.
[00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.313]  Our bubble is about one-tenth, depending on the angles you look at, that of the Chai Comps.
[00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:52.148]  The Chaikoms totally rigged their economy.
[00:09:52.448 --> 00:09:53.969]  They totally devalued their currency.
[00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:57.251]  Ten times worse than us, like Mexico did back in the 1980s.
[00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:59.772]  And then you know what happened to the peso?
[00:10:01.273 --> 00:10:03.334]  It's about at a Mexican level of devaluation.
[00:10:03.354 --> 00:10:06.996]  It's not as bad as Zimbabwe or the Germans with my republic.
[00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:08.637]  It's about what the Mexicans did.
[00:10:09.298 --> 00:10:12.279]  Now the difference is the Mexicans didn't have a giant military and 1.5 million people.
[00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:17.512]  And didn't own our debt, and didn't own Hollywood.
[00:10:17.532 --> 00:10:22.415]  If you don't believe that, just look up China now owns the controlling interest in all the big six production companies.
[00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:32.303]  And of course the Mexicans weren't waging an open war with us, and they weren't anti-Western.
[00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.866]  Because there's a Spanish ethos that's European in Mexico.
[00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:41.250]  But when you have China, you have a formidable power that's the biggest mass murderer in history.
[00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.592]  But because they have a devalued currency, they're very weak.
[00:10:48.892 --> 00:10:54.974]  But they still have all this military prowess and we're dependent on all their slave goods.
[00:10:55.495 --> 00:11:07.740]  But as soon as Trump calls that card, as soon as he calls that bluff, as soon as he exposes that the Emperor's not wearing any clothes, as soon as he calls them out,
[00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:09.089]  It's over.
[00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.290]  And he's doing it.
[00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.832]  We hold all the cards, as President Trump has said over and over again.
[00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:13.472]  And it's true.
[00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:17.796]  Except we have a dumbed-down, decadent, snot-nosed population.
[00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:19.917]  At least 30% in the studies.
[00:11:20.057 --> 00:11:20.557]  The real numbers.
[00:11:21.178 --> 00:11:23.540]  30% are foaming at the mouth Democrat crazies.
[00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:28.943]  Another 35-40% aren't politically involved and are just kind of in la-la land.
[00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:31.725]  And you got another 30% fighting for our lives.
[00:11:32.266 --> 00:11:32.666]  And winning.
[00:11:34.968 --> 00:11:36.429]  But I want everybody just to pull back.
[00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:43.639]  If you're a radio listener especially, while I'm talking, they're putting up The Economist on Mother Rothschild.
[00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:54.867]  They're putting up the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, talking about how America sucks and it's all over for us and how we need to totally not invest in America and invest in China.
[00:11:55.887 --> 00:12:00.991]  And that same thing comes out of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, and all these globalist publications.
[00:12:02.247 --> 00:12:02.908]  And it's not true.
[00:12:03.828 --> 00:12:05.950]  China has tens of thousands of riots a year.
[00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.672]  China is oppressing its people.
[00:12:08.172 --> 00:12:10.774]  China doesn't have any raw resources inside their country.
[00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:13.797]  China is trying to expand and is surrounded by enemies.
[00:12:14.277 --> 00:12:19.241]  India, and South Korea, and Japan, who aren't going to put up with their crap.
[00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:21.063]  Philippines is going to put up with it.
[00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:27.013]  And so China's trying to be expansionist because their empire is failing.
[00:12:27.273 --> 00:12:37.942]  Just like the Japanese, this is all a repeat of the beginning of World War II, was expanding because they had a bunch of hubris and wanted to dominate, but they didn't have the resources.
[00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.565]  China has been given the resources.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:49.543]  They've been given a global monopoly on the extraction of rarest minerals by global corporate boards and the WTO.
[00:12:49.804 --> 00:12:52.085]  They have been spoon-fed.
[00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:53.986]  They have been built up.
[00:12:54.646 --> 00:13:00.489]  They have been developed as the supposed champion of the world.
[00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:07.553]  And they're not.
[00:13:07.693 --> 00:13:09.094]  They are a paper dragon.
[00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.120]  They have a lot of really great, hard-working people that are enslaved by it.
[00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:27.269]  But you look at the Taiwanese and the folks in Hong Kong, beautiful, smart, informed, dynamic people amongst the per capita most successful people in the world when they're turned loose and given some basic freedom.
[00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:37.492]  You look at the demeanor of the people in the mainland versus the demeanor of the people in Hong Kong or Taiwan, it's night and day.
[00:13:37.852 --> 00:13:44.973]  And so, their grandparents and parents were run out of China by a dictator, by a murdering Red Terror that took over in 1949.
[00:13:45.134 --> 00:13:49.454]  That then killed 115 million mainline Chinese.
[00:13:50.035 --> 00:13:56.496]  You better believe they've got a reason to be standing up and tearing down surveillance light poles and fighting the police.
[00:13:57.216 --> 00:13:58.856]  And taking over government buildings, effectively.
[00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:02.117]  Because they're passing laws to secretly arrest them.
[00:14:03.148 --> 00:14:05.448]  They're going to get rid of their representative republic.
[00:14:07.909 --> 00:14:13.110]  And I see some of the establishment lefties commenting on Infowars.com and Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:19.131]  They're saying, oh, Jones claims he's anti-war, but look, he's backing regime change in Hong Kong.
[00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.952]  I'm not backing regime change.
[00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:30.614]  The Chai Koms are overthrowing the government and the system and have already put their government in that's now dissolving the freedoms those people fought for.
[00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:38.453]  And I won't stand here and watch another 7 million people turned over to the CHICOMS to be rendered down and robbed!
[00:14:38.473 --> 00:14:49.856]  And God bless our president for running a pincer attack against the CHICOMS because they started all this South China Sea and taking over all these islands and attacking Vietnam and all this crap.
[00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:58.898]  Show the Indians have been turned loose to take back 20% of their country that the Pakistan and the CHICOMS are taking over that's theirs!
[00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:06.940]  The Chai Kams made them pass laws along with the UN that Hindus can't immigrate back to where they were run out of by the Muslims.
[00:15:08.463 --> 00:15:08.964]  Imagine that!
[00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:11.297]  They had a U.N.
[00:15:11.337 --> 00:15:16.599]  agreement that Indians that were indigenous basically had to leave and couldn't come back.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.220]  So Trump's turned Modi loose.
[00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:34.128]  And now he's turning Hong Kong and Taiwan loose and selling weapons to Taiwan and selling weapons to Japan and weapons to South Korea and telling the Chi-Coms and the CFR and the globalists that thought the American century was over that you miscalculated and that's not happening!
[00:15:37.213 --> 00:15:46.380]  So in response, the traitorous global media, foreign-owned, Chi-Com-owned, is flooding in trying to cause race wars, death, destruction, imploding our economy.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.803]  And everyone remember that the people that sided with this are openly working with foreign enemies.
[00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:56.447]  CNN now says Trump has killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:00.530]  That is the moon is made of green cheese level lie.
[00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.691]  We'll cover it when we come back.
[00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:07.842]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:13.376]  I just devoured your cousin InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.003]  What's going on here?
[00:17:03.976 --> 00:17:07.717]  We have a new product line in that I'm extremely excited about.
[00:17:07.837 --> 00:17:14.740]  Everybody knows that Super Silver is the strongest over-the-counter, FDA approved for over-the-counter sale.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.361]  Silver there is.
[00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:18.061]  It's used in medical clinics.
[00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:19.022]  It's used in hospitals.
[00:17:19.702 --> 00:17:20.382]  It's for wounds.
[00:17:20.482 --> 00:17:23.323]  A little pea-sized amount of it is like a shield on your skin.
[00:17:23.804 --> 00:17:24.384]  It's amazing.
[00:17:24.624 --> 00:17:25.424]  Everybody needs it.
[00:17:25.584 --> 00:17:27.545]  Once you've been wounded, once you've got a scratch or a
[00:17:27.705 --> 00:17:28.025]  A little bit.
[00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:30.628]  When you're gonna be going out and doing something, don't ingest it, though.
[00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:31.369]  It's really strong.
[00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:32.970]  It's not good for bacteria and viruses for a reason.
[00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.131]  It's mean.
[00:17:34.372 --> 00:17:36.134]  And the particles are so small, they go right into them.
[00:17:36.174 --> 00:17:37.215]  So this is the best stuff out there.
[00:17:37.275 --> 00:17:40.338]  But I said, everybody says we should put out a high-quality skin cream.
[00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:46.484]  I said, why don't we put the silver in that, but not just get it approved for over-the-counter sale, just so you can have it at stores and stay up to date.
[00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:46.724]  True.
[00:17:46.744 --> 00:17:47.745]  Well, that's what we got them to do.
[00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:48.585]  The same big company.
[00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:49.806]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:50.546]  I've been so busy.
[00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:53.128]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:55.289]  But it's very exciting from the same company.
[00:17:55.369 --> 00:17:56.049]  But it's new.
[00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:57.850]  Working with another big skin care company.
[00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.351]  They're producing it in their factory.
[00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:01.753]  It's super silver skin cream.
[00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.934]  And so it's got all of these benefits.
[00:18:03.994 --> 00:18:05.034]  Too many to mention.
[00:18:05.094 --> 00:18:06.175]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:18:06.355 --> 00:18:07.176]  It's brand new.
[00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:08.076]  People are going to love it.
[00:18:08.136 --> 00:18:10.157]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.

[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.601]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[00:18:17.621 --> 00:18:19.722]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:22.383]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[00:18:22.503 --> 00:18:26.265]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:31.287]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[00:18:31.427 --> 00:18:42.391]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[00:18:42.551 --> 00:18:43.471]  Yeah, I mean, I've done independent studies.
[00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:47.952]  I've shown a silver salt technology and super silver skin cream is 20 p.m.
[00:18:48.012 --> 00:18:53.934]  Silver is used to 10 times more effective than amateur and similar products containing up to 3000 p.m.
[00:18:54.074 --> 00:18:54.354]  Silver.
[00:18:54.494 --> 00:18:54.994]  It goes on.
[00:18:55.114 --> 00:18:56.154]  This stuff is the real deal.
[00:18:56.174 --> 00:19:00.335]  Get super silver skin cream exclusively for store dot com while supplies last.
[00:19:00.435 --> 00:19:03.016]  It's got the highly sought after hyaluronic acid.
[00:19:03.176 --> 00:19:08.757]  So this is stuff that has a lot of known great compounds and it's got the silver in it from one of the
[00:19:11.798 --> 00:19:14.540]  Want to get this for yourself for external use only.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.781]  And we've got it in the straight, no scent.
[00:19:16.801 --> 00:19:17.582]  It's not really a scent.
[00:19:17.682 --> 00:19:18.162]  It's natural.
[00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:20.023]  And we've also got it with the grapefruit.
[00:19:20.043 --> 00:19:21.084]  It's also got all those added.
[00:19:21.344 --> 00:19:22.384]  We have little tubes of it.
[00:19:22.424 --> 00:19:23.345]  We have big tubes of it.
[00:19:23.525 --> 00:19:24.706]  And it's a great deal.
[00:19:24.786 --> 00:19:28.108]  Again, $7.45 for the little one.
[00:19:28.388 --> 00:19:32.931]  And if you get the big ones, you get an even better deal for the amount that you get $14.95.
[00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:33.531]  And I can tell you
[00:19:34.972 --> 00:19:37.293]  Similar brands sold at stores that don't have the silver.
[00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:38.674]  Retail for $25.
[00:19:38.734 --> 00:19:39.034]  Sell for $19.95.
[00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.355]  So this is even better at $14.95.
[00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.036]  That is a really good deal.
[00:19:43.176 --> 00:19:45.658]  So this is a whole new enchilada.
[00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:47.278]  It's a whole new world.
[00:19:47.298 --> 00:19:51.841]  And I believe it's going to end up being a national bestseller, not just here.
[00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:55.103]  And I believe it's going to fund us into taking the country and the world back.
[00:19:55.143 --> 00:19:56.063]  So please, check it out.
[00:19:56.103 --> 00:19:58.084]  The new products at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:09.125]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:58.973]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide on this Monday edition of the Transmission.
[00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:08.797]  Now, we played this clip yesterday on the Sunday Transmission, but I'm going to play it again right now because it illustrates everything insane that we're dealing with.
[00:21:08.817 --> 00:21:23.222]  And then if you think that this is an insane clip, we're going to play an even bigger lie because I was sitting back yesterday thinking, is this the biggest lie CNN has ever told?
[00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:38.036]  Yes, it probably is, but it's only rivaled by one other lie that the same show told Brian Stelter last year.
[00:21:40.437 --> 00:21:43.960]  And that was that ratings don't matter.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:49.023]  So we're going to be playing that secondarily, but listen to this.
[00:21:49.043 --> 00:21:50.344]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:53.437]  It's on newswars.com.
[00:21:53.798 --> 00:21:54.178]  Wow!
[00:21:55.179 --> 00:22:04.687]  CNN guest says Trump murdered many more millions of people than Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:13.855]  He had a truly insane lying guest on, psychiatrist Alan Francis.
[00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:18.739]  And he said Hitler has, you know, not even as bad as Trump.
[00:22:19.617 --> 00:22:21.238]  Not other dictators throughout history.
[00:22:21.738 --> 00:22:26.101]  Trump may have killed more.
[00:22:28.323 --> 00:22:31.264]  Now, Trump is trying to pull us out of Afghanistan.
[00:22:31.285 --> 00:22:32.285]  He's pulled us out of Syria.
[00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:35.847]  He's trying to pull troops back to the U.S.
[00:22:35.907 --> 00:22:37.669]  He's trying to increase their pay, which he has.
[00:22:38.629 --> 00:22:44.373]  He's trying to end the 70-year, almost 70-year conflict with North Korea.
[00:22:46.152 --> 00:22:53.556]  I mean, he's done a way better job than Barack Obama or anybody for 50 years has done, trying to de-escalate things.
[00:22:54.436 --> 00:23:00.099]  So for this statement to be made, it is a total inversion of reality.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.563]  But we've been asking, how much worse is the rhetoric going to get that he's a Nazi, that he's killing kids at the border?
[00:23:06.603 --> 00:23:07.443]  None of that's true.
[00:23:07.463 --> 00:23:10.324]  They're drinking out of toilets.
[00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:12.986]  He says all Mexicans are criminals.
[00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:14.867]  Never said any of that.
[00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:22.055]  And so now the new Whopper, you know it's a talking point, because they've already been saying Trump's a dictator.
[00:23:24.056 --> 00:23:29.060]  No, it's Hillary that ignored the primaries when Bernie was winning.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.801]  It's the superdelegates that did that.
[00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:33.763]  If she would have won, she would have gotten there by dictatorial aims.
[00:23:34.103 --> 00:23:40.148]  So again, they continue to project what they are on to everyone else.
[00:23:41.709 --> 00:23:42.710]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:23:44.636 --> 00:23:49.501]  Well, I think that medicalizing politics has three very dire consequences.
[00:23:50.522 --> 00:23:53.625]  The first is that it stigmatizes the mentally ill.
[00:23:54.185 --> 00:24:00.391]  I've known thousands of patients, almost all of them have been well-behaved, well-mannered, good people.
[00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:01.772]  Trump is none of these.
[00:24:02.453 --> 00:24:09.139]  Lumping the mentally ill with Trump is a terrible insult to the mentally ill, and they have enough problems and stigma as it is.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:21.062]  The second issue is that calling Trump crazy hides the fact that we're crazy for having elected him, and even crazier for allowing his crazy policies to persist.
[00:24:21.722 --> 00:24:28.064]  Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, and Mao were in the last century.
[00:24:28.504 --> 00:24:31.804]  He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.
[00:24:32.505 --> 00:24:38.546]  He needs to be contained, but he needs to be contained by attacking his policies, not his person.
[00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:46.040]  So they're trying to get a psychiatrist on, a leftist, to violate their own policies, their own rules.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:58.163]  They can be removed by the medical board from their quack position if they engage in diagnosing from afar without at least three consultations, testing, and meetings.
[00:24:58.203 --> 00:25:00.944]  And of course, that is the Goldwater rule.
[00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:04.148]  But instead, he just veered off and said, no, no, no.
[00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:10.638]  This individual, ladies and gentlemen, is worse than mass murdering dictators.
[00:25:10.678 --> 00:25:11.981]  In fact, he's killed more people.
[00:25:12.401 --> 00:25:13.523]  That's quite a whopper.
[00:25:14.397 --> 00:25:15.397]  But I've got one even bigger.
[00:25:16.017 --> 00:25:23.139]  Jimmy Dore, who's a liberal but really smart guy, and if more leftists were like that guy, they might actually get people elected.
[00:25:23.699 --> 00:25:25.399]  He made some great points, the comedian did.
[00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:28.040]  He's also spit on me before in public, but that's okay.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:35.482]  Here's Jimmy Dore pointing out that Brian Stelter is the biggest fraud the planet's ever seen.
[00:25:35.502 --> 00:25:41.683]  This was Brian Stelter's show where this was just being said that Trump has killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[00:25:41.703 --> 00:25:42.003]  Here it is.
[00:25:42.918 --> 00:25:44.322]  Hang on, I want to show you this.
[00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.688]  I don't know!
[00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.891]  Good God!
[00:25:51.221 --> 00:26:12.766]  So this guy's talking with Ted Koppel and Ted Koppel tells him because they all try to pretend they hate Trump but you know they love Trump because he gives them a lot more money and they all make it and remember the comedian at the Correspondents Dinner said you guys should give him some of your money that you're making off of him because Trump doesn't have any money he's broke remember when she said that?
[00:26:13.066 --> 00:26:15.567]  So, Ted Koppel's gonna say that to Brian Stitzer.
[00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:19.189]  By the way, he hosts that show, Reliable Sources, just in case you didn't know who that was.
[00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:22.010]  And so here, let's watch this.
[00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.431]  Money, money, money!
[00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:27.772]  Donald Trump has been very, very good for baseball.
[00:26:29.073 --> 00:26:31.634]  He has been wonderful for the industry.
[00:26:32.771 --> 00:26:38.052]  Your boss acknowledged as much a number of months ago during the campaign.
[00:26:38.072 --> 00:26:40.633]  It was Les Mondes who acknowledged it.
[00:26:40.693 --> 00:26:44.834]  Les Mondes also acknowledged it, but so did the head of CNN.
[00:26:45.194 --> 00:26:47.175]  But that means what?
[00:26:47.295 --> 00:26:48.835]  If ratings are up, that means what?
[00:26:51.796 --> 00:26:52.596]  Oh, Dave!
[00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:58.918]  If ratings are up, Brian Selster is about to get educated on how media works.
[00:26:58.998 --> 00:26:59.298]  Here we go.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.300]  Oh, the ratings are up.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.261]  It means you can't do without Donald Trump.
[00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:06.962]  You would be lost without Donald Trump.
[00:27:07.262 --> 00:27:08.422]  That's what he said.
[00:27:08.602 --> 00:27:10.003]  Sam, you know that's not true.
[00:27:10.283 --> 00:27:13.664]  CNN... What?
[00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:15.584]  Reliable sources just told you.
[00:27:16.324 --> 00:27:18.925]  CNN would be in the toilet without Donald Trump.
[00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:22.431]  Here we go.
[00:27:22.451 --> 00:27:23.732]  Now watch it, Plato.
[00:27:23.752 --> 00:27:24.452]  That's not true.
[00:27:24.472 --> 00:27:26.213]  You're playing for laughs.
[00:27:26.653 --> 00:27:30.135]  You've lived through enough presidencies to know there will be more presidents.
[00:27:30.595 --> 00:27:33.717]  What were the ratings before Trump and what are the ratings now?
[00:27:34.457 --> 00:27:35.818]  I would say we might be up 20.
[00:27:35.898 --> 00:27:37.139]  We might be up 30 percent.
[00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:37.859]  We might be up 40 percent.
[00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:39.800]  We might be up 30, 40, 50.
[00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:41.721]  I don't know.
[00:27:41.741 --> 00:27:42.321]  I don't know.
[00:27:42.341 --> 00:27:43.562]  Specifics aren't important to me.
[00:27:43.602 --> 00:27:44.022]  I'm a journalist.
[00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:45.863]  Here are the numbers I don't know about that are higher.
[00:27:47.682 --> 00:27:48.282]  Maybe 40, 50, 60.
[00:27:48.723 --> 00:27:49.663]  It doesn't matter.
[00:27:49.683 --> 00:27:50.624]  It's a media company.
[00:27:50.784 --> 00:27:51.884]  We don't care about money.
[00:27:51.904 --> 00:27:58.148]  If we go back down 40%, that's okay too.
[00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:01.690]  Can I pause real quick?
[00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.171]  Look at how officious he is.
[00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:05.212]  How into himself.
[00:28:05.252 --> 00:28:07.153]  How self-satisfied.
[00:28:07.233 --> 00:28:10.315]  And Brian Silver tries to act like he's this big, powerful man.
[00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:11.756]  He puts on this fake demeanor.
[00:28:12.636 --> 00:28:14.337]  I mean, say one about Ted Koppel.
[00:28:14.397 --> 00:28:15.798]  He's got a lot of presence.
[00:28:17.059 --> 00:28:19.161]  Brian Stelter is no Ted Koppel.
[00:28:19.982 --> 00:28:20.983]  It's pathetic.
[00:28:21.803 --> 00:28:24.466]  But again, he's the little media analyst from the New York Times.
[00:28:25.266 --> 00:28:26.788]  All these know-it-alls.
[00:28:26.808 --> 00:28:32.093]  Have you ever seen that particular New York Times reporter, I forget her name, when she was on Joe Rogan last year?
[00:28:33.054 --> 00:28:36.317]  And Joe just starts asking her questions when she calls
[00:28:38.368 --> 00:28:42.709]  One of the Democrat candidates, a toady of Assad, and then he just, well, what's a toady?
[00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:44.150]  Well, I don't know what that word means.
[00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:50.731]  These people are, again, paper tigers, paper dragons, allies of the Chai Koms.
[00:28:51.351 --> 00:28:54.772]  We'll break more of that down and hit a ton of other critical news.
[00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:57.693]  Too much to tell you right now on the other side.
[00:28:57.733 --> 00:28:58.673]  Whatever you do, spread the links.
[00:28:58.893 --> 00:29:00.794]  NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.933]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:29:10.194 --> 00:29:13.337]  The British ended up being the most powerful empire in the world.
[00:29:13.457 --> 00:29:14.879]  Not because the Spanish couldn't fight.
[00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:16.501]  Not because the Portuguese couldn't fight.
[00:29:16.601 --> 00:29:19.124]  Not because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire couldn't fight.
[00:29:19.184 --> 00:29:21.406]  You ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[00:29:21.727 --> 00:29:24.069]  The British ended up getting basically key limes.
[00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:35.157]  When they went into the Caribbean 500 years ago, and they had their captains right, and their ship's doctors, how long sailors survived, what climates, they were trying to figure out what's making sickness.
[00:29:35.177 --> 00:29:38.299]  They weren't sure if it was hot air or why they got close to the shore.
[00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:40.140]  More of their sailors would die in a couple days.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.022]  And they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes.
[00:29:42.162 --> 00:29:44.643]  But the British classified that 400 years ago.
[00:29:44.703 --> 00:29:46.505]  So the British would always lay off the coast.
[00:29:46.725 --> 00:29:49.367]  And foreigners would ask, why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:50.187]  They don't want mosquitoes.
[00:29:50.627 --> 00:29:51.388]  And they get all the
[00:29:51.528 --> 00:29:53.789]  The fevers, the malaria that came with mosquitoes.
[00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:56.569]  Well, the Brits also figured out with their scientists, limes.
[00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.430]  But the Brits were suspicious.
[00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.311]  The average sailor thought if you swim, you get sick.
[00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:02.891]  And they thought, you know, you don't want to eat vegetables, they make you sick.
[00:30:02.911 --> 00:30:04.652]  This is what people actually thought back then.
[00:30:05.492 --> 00:30:08.613]  So they would put the limes in the grog.
[00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:09.914]  Which is, what's grog?
[00:30:10.054 --> 00:30:11.395]  One-third rum, two-thirds water.
[00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:12.996]  To make sure they would at least drink their water.
[00:30:13.036 --> 00:30:16.378]  Part of their pay, their daily ration for good behavior, was grog.
[00:30:16.578 --> 00:30:21.582]  So on the job, all sailors, Spanish, Russian, it didn't matter, they were paid in alcohol.
[00:30:21.722 --> 00:30:23.343]  And part of their daily food was alcohol.
[00:30:23.383 --> 00:30:28.547]  So the British would start putting, 400 years ago, limes in the alcohol, the grog.
[00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:34.511]  And so, what would happen when they were a thousand miles from home and ran up against a Spanish frigate twice their size?
[00:30:34.672 --> 00:30:36.713]  Well, the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out.
[00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:38.054]  They had cuts all over them.
[00:30:38.234 --> 00:30:40.015]  Open wounds.
[00:30:40.216 --> 00:30:41.296]  No fresh vegetables.
[00:30:41.316 --> 00:30:55.007]  No vitamin C. Well, notice the British for 200 years could keep it secret that limes were... And so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in.
[00:30:55.287 --> 00:31:01.332]  And they would put it in the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight.
[00:31:01.952 --> 00:31:05.115]  Because they've got vitamin C. So I'm going into a plug here, but here's the deal.
[00:31:05.295 --> 00:31:10.580]  Every study, Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes for vitamin C. So these are the things that are known.
[00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:14.404]  If you think vitamin C is powerful, the stuff in DNA force is even beyond that.
[00:31:14.524 --> 00:31:15.585]  It's the next level of that.
[00:31:15.766 --> 00:31:16.526]  That's what we know.
[00:31:16.867 --> 00:31:20.250]  And when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine,
[00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.291]  It uses the bad halogen.
[00:31:21.411 --> 00:31:24.733]  At a certain point, the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive.
[00:31:24.953 --> 00:31:28.055]  They start mutating so they can use that and not die.
[00:31:28.355 --> 00:31:31.057]  But then they take over your body and you die from cancer.
[00:31:31.197 --> 00:31:38.582]  And so, so much of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[00:31:38.762 --> 00:31:40.883]  And they work around the clock with all these fake reports.
[00:31:41.043 --> 00:31:45.046]  Oh, you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals, you don't need... And they lower the amount you're supposed to take.
[00:31:45.146 --> 00:31:48.088]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:32:06.229 --> 00:32:07.190]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.351]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:09.952]  What's your view?
[00:32:10.012 --> 00:32:10.632]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[00:32:10.732 --> 00:32:11.793]  I appreciate you having me on.
[00:32:11.853 --> 00:32:13.634]  First off, I wanted to thank you for Bonnie.
[00:32:13.654 --> 00:32:24.962]  You've been using it for a while, but I sent a bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[00:32:24.982 --> 00:32:25.923]  She was ecstatic.
[00:32:25.963 --> 00:32:32.587]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[00:32:32.747 --> 00:32:33.248]  Tumor-y.
[00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.952]  Curry in India is powerful.
[00:32:36.992 --> 00:32:39.234]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[00:32:39.334 --> 00:32:39.675]  Ours is 95%.
[00:32:39.715 --> 00:32:42.697]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[00:32:43.318 --> 00:32:46.000]  So, Advil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.763]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:52.265]  So that's why BODYS is so incredible.
[00:32:52.305 --> 00:32:54.647]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.
[00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:58.070]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because BODYS is amazing.
[00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:58.951]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:33:06.503 --> 00:33:09.224]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:34:04.193 --> 00:34:08.075]  Hong Kong protesters wave the American flag in their marches.
[00:34:08.555 --> 00:34:11.176]  Why are you all holding the American flag today for this protest?
[00:34:12.297 --> 00:34:17.518]  It's because the American flag represents freedom, democracy, and liberty.
[00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:21.720]  And we wish to raise the awareness from the American people.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.880]  And we wish the U.S.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.942]  Congress can pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act as soon as possible.
[00:34:31.422 --> 00:34:38.844]  Saturday's protests in Hong Kong was about standing against Chai Kong facial recognition and the social credit score system.
[00:34:41.351 --> 00:34:44.752]  And they used the Pepe the Frog meme as a symbol of freedom.
[00:34:45.112 --> 00:34:46.993]  What does Pepe the Frog mean to your movement?
[00:34:47.713 --> 00:34:58.457]  Actually we think that it is a kind of sticker that is well known and it is easy to spread for people to know more about what this protest means and what we are doing.
[00:34:58.497 --> 00:35:05.039]  Have you heard that in America a lot of the mainstream media and the left are actually saying that this is a racist symbol for some reason?
[00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:22.502]  Yeah, I know this in the recent days, but I think that the creator of the PIP has come out and speak for us that we are not representing the left society, but represent the Hong Kong people.
[00:35:22.602 --> 00:35:23.943]  Yeah, and freedom, I would say, too.
[00:35:23.983 --> 00:35:25.464]  It's almost the exact opposite.
[00:35:25.484 --> 00:35:26.085]  Thank you for talking to me.
[00:35:26.105 --> 00:35:28.747]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say to our audience in America and the world?
[00:35:29.607 --> 00:35:30.848]  Hong Kong people never give up.
[00:35:33.217 --> 00:35:37.878]  After the march officially ended, police in riot gear began clearing the streets.
[00:35:38.959 --> 00:35:41.780]  And many Hong Kongers stayed to provoke them.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.682]  Again, this is just some of the dramatic footage that's posted on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:36:23.722 --> 00:36:25.683]  It's not really for radio, but I wanted to...
[00:36:26.448 --> 00:36:38.107]  Play a few minutes of this because it just shows the dramatic fight for people that don't want to be taken over by the Communist Chinese and have their elected government removed by them and have laws passed where they can be extradited.
[00:36:39.068 --> 00:36:40.210]  Coming up next segment...
[00:36:41.141 --> 00:36:48.649]  I'm going to get into a really important story dealing with another false flag that's been committed in this country and that's an admitted false flag.
[00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.192]  They're not denying that this is a false flag.
[00:36:51.212 --> 00:36:58.239]  They're not denying that this has been done, though they're trying to keep it under wraps like Jussie Smollett.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.543]  And in this whole culture of victimization, people are more and more and more obsessed with playing the part of victims.
[00:37:08.723 --> 00:37:12.404]  And it's the basic breakdown of society.
[00:37:13.144 --> 00:37:18.066]  But I wanted to get to some really important reports that illustrate what we were talking about earlier.
[00:37:18.206 --> 00:37:20.546]  And that's the clip we're going to go to in a moment.
[00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:22.167]  That's clip number seven.
[00:37:23.247 --> 00:37:36.314]  Trump uses g7 to take care of business at John Bowne report because that ties into what I was detailing earlier and that deals with the fact that our media
[00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:38.010]  It's not our media.
[00:37:38.211 --> 00:37:51.798]  It's owned by multinational corporations, the Chi-Coms, a consortium of very ruthless corporations that see their fellow humans as unconscious animals that are being rendered down and removed and made obsolete.
[00:37:52.159 --> 00:37:54.080]  Here's a headline out of NBC News today.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.802]  Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world.
[00:37:58.885 --> 00:38:00.447]  That's what they're saying everywhere.
[00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:01.128]  That's the message.
[00:38:01.168 --> 00:38:01.628]  Lay down.
[00:38:01.728 --> 00:38:02.109]  Give up.
[00:38:02.469 --> 00:38:02.830]  Die.
[00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.430]  It's all over.
[00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:08.977]  A lot of folks are receiving that message, at least subconsciously, and deciding to do just that.
[00:38:10.298 --> 00:38:14.743]  Now, continuing here, it's not just that the media is citing
[00:38:15.686 --> 00:38:16.466]  I don't think so.
[00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.916]  A large portion of us won't fight against that.
[00:38:46.936 --> 00:38:50.530]  It really shows that we've had our basic instincts turned off.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:39:01.448]  They met in Béjards, France, an ancient southwestern French Basque whaling town just 22 miles across the Bay of Biscay from Spain.
[00:39:01.768 --> 00:39:14.839]  Or at least that's what the massively unpopular French President Emmanuel Macron was diligently distracting the world leaders with at the beginning of the G7 while his police swept the quiet coastline for mines.
[00:39:15.279 --> 00:39:17.661]  Macron didn't want to mention his 32% approval rating,
[00:39:19.182 --> 00:39:22.283]  Or the G7 protests within miles of the summit.
[00:39:22.563 --> 00:39:28.785]  No mention of the now 11 months of yellow vest protests that have turned the country upside down.
[00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:32.986]  But that didn't stop Russian President Putin from reminding Macron.
[00:39:33.066 --> 00:39:35.727]  The events linked to the so-called yellow vests
[00:39:36.147 --> 00:39:44.190]  During which, according to our calculations, 11 people were killed and 2,500 injured, including 2,000 police officers.
[00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:54.353]  We wouldn't want such events to take place in the Russian capital, and we'll do all we can to ensure our domestic political situation evolves strictly in the framework of the law.
[00:39:55.205 --> 00:39:58.467]  Macron said the comparison with France was inaccurate.
[00:39:58.727 --> 00:40:09.774]  And as Macron blathered on about his own vulgar incompetence, back at the adult table, President Trump and English Prime Minister Boris Johnson talked about the future of Brexit.
[00:40:13.937 --> 00:40:15.838]  We don't anticipate any problems.
[00:40:16.679 --> 00:40:19.121]  Before, we were sort of stymied.
[00:40:19.141 --> 00:40:25.945]  Well, I was stymied by the other side because nothing got done on the other side, as you've seen from Brexit.
[00:40:25.985 --> 00:40:32.229]  This is a different person, and this is a person that's going to be a great Prime Minister, in my opinion.
[00:40:32.289 --> 00:40:39.114]  Boris, it's only my opinion.
[00:40:48.261 --> 00:40:56.989]  And then President Trump unleashed the undeniable truth of China's economic stranglehold on the United States and drew a line in the sand.
[00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.494]  Are you going to declare a national emergency on China?
[00:41:04.096 --> 00:41:05.417]  Well, I have the right to, if I want.
[00:41:05.637 --> 00:41:07.538]  I could declare a national emergency.
[00:41:07.638 --> 00:41:22.305]  I think when they steal and take out and intellectual property theft, anywhere from $300 billion to $500 billion a year, and when we have a total loss of almost a trillion dollars a year, for many years this has been going on.
[00:41:22.885 --> 00:41:23.826]  Thank you very much.
[00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:27.448]  We've been working on a deal with Japan for a long time.
[00:41:27.488 --> 00:41:32.090]  It involves agricultural and it involves e-commerce and many other things.
[00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:35.508]  It's a very big transaction and we've agreed in principle.
[00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:37.930]  It's billions and billions of dollars.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.382]  Tremendous for the farmers.
[00:41:41.442 --> 00:41:52.330]  Quite frankly, around the table there's a lot of people wanting to make trade deals with each other and we have a deal that we were able to negotiate that's good for our workers, good for our citizens, good for the middle class.
[00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:57.715]  Macron proved he could be a good host and point at the coast of Spain for all of his guests.
[00:41:58.095 --> 00:42:06.362]  But more importantly, Macron solidified his utter failure as a global leader and a historically detested president of France.
[00:42:06.802 --> 00:42:07.903]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:18.862]  Now there are many other very important, informative reports on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com just like that one.
[00:42:19.463 --> 00:42:31.669]  So many by Millie Weaver and by Harrison Smith and people like Caitlin Bennett and Paul Joseph Watson that it does again boggle the mind.
[00:42:32.669 --> 00:42:37.652]  And when you go out and you get those clips and you email those and you text message those and you hand share those,
[00:42:38.823 --> 00:42:39.864]  That's how you change the world.
[00:42:39.904 --> 00:42:45.088]  That's how you override the censors and big tech and all the things they're doing.
[00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:48.091]  We're very, very close to action against big tech.
[00:42:48.551 --> 00:42:49.973]  I've got some news on that next hour.
[00:42:51.033 --> 00:42:54.356]  Also, Count Dankula from Scotland, very interesting fella.
[00:42:54.777 --> 00:42:59.040]  He's gonna be in studio as well to get into some stuff that, well, you're gonna have to hear it from him.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.321]  It's so, so over the top.
[00:43:00.341 --> 00:43:01.262]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.563 --> 00:43:03.024]  It's time.
[00:43:03.908 --> 00:43:10.970]  The power structure started out with Nazis and other unsavory groups that banned them first to set the precedent.
[00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:20.553]  But now they've moved on to popular populists like the Yellow Vest Movement, like Tommy Robinson, like Gavin McInnes, like Laura Loomer.
[00:43:21.254 --> 00:43:24.095]  The whole spectrum of people that are independent and are effective.
[00:43:24.755 --> 00:43:28.076]  There's an attempt to shut that down because they want to control the narrative.
[00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:45.288]  And if that is successful and continuing, it's really a giant electronic iron curtain that Churchill talked about seven years ago, dropping down across the entire planet, and it's only going to intensify.
[00:43:45.368 --> 00:43:48.390]  So this is a desperate gamble.
[00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:54.351]  I don't think it's going to be successful.
[00:43:54.932 --> 00:44:06.194]  I believe in the people, but to have the establishment misrepresent who you are, create a straw man that ban you and then take you down, I don't see that as a position of strength.
[00:44:06.254 --> 00:44:11.136]  I see that as a real position of weakness, and I think it's going to backfire.
[00:44:11.876 --> 00:44:14.216]  Because most people don't do this one time.
[00:44:17.999 --> 00:44:20.680]  In the final equation, I'm in full wars.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:28.742]  And what I've done has already, we have changed the course of human destiny in a big way.
[00:44:28.962 --> 00:44:34.344]  And so if I did one of those things in my life, I would feel fulfilled.
[00:44:34.964 --> 00:44:37.345]  Like I had really done what I was supposed to.
[00:44:38.385 --> 00:44:40.066]  So I intend to continue on.
[00:44:40.846 --> 00:44:42.286]  I continue to try to change the world.
[00:44:43.087 --> 00:44:47.368]  But my dream is to be able to stop what I'm doing.
[00:44:49.352 --> 00:44:51.693]  In the next five years or so.
[00:44:52.814 --> 00:44:54.315]  Because you can't do this forever.
[00:44:54.335 --> 00:44:59.338]  And politically I've hit the zeitgeist four times.
[00:45:00.558 --> 00:45:03.220]  Four times we've already changed the course of the planet.
[00:45:04.235 --> 00:45:08.178]  And I think it's almost bad luck to go for a fifth or a sixth time.
[00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:11.301]  So, it's not that I don't want the fight.
[00:45:11.461 --> 00:45:12.142]  I want the fight.
[00:45:12.202 --> 00:45:19.568]  But it's almost boorish or greedy or pig-like to continue to think that you're supposed to.
[00:45:19.608 --> 00:45:21.890]  Because most people don't do this one time.
[00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:24.812]  Well, four times.
[00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:26.874]  Four times.
[00:45:28.255 --> 00:45:32.258]  We have changed the course of human destiny in a big way.
[00:45:34.933 --> 00:45:45.843]  I just want the fifth time to warn everybody about the tyranny and the censorship and see humanity respond and then step back and fade into shadows.
[00:45:45.923 --> 00:45:46.844]  That's really my goal.
[00:45:47.725 --> 00:45:50.307]  But I got a sneaking suspicion that that's not going to happen.
[00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:55.932]  And I think I'm probably going to change paradigms 10 times, 20 times.
[00:45:56.813 --> 00:45:58.935]  So nobody else will do it.
[00:45:59.415 --> 00:45:59.956]  So I got to do it.
[00:46:06.127 --> 00:46:08.728]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[00:46:09.548 --> 00:46:12.729]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:14.590]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:19.452]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:25.414]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[00:46:25.474 --> 00:46:26.494]  It's a form of fascism.
[00:46:27.612 --> 00:46:31.093]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[00:46:31.193 --> 00:46:37.916]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:46:42.518 --> 00:46:45.959]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[00:46:54.142 --> 00:46:55.363]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.123]  You can't watch this.
[00:46:59.444 --> 00:47:02.851]  The movie available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:47:05.998 --> 00:47:08.623]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.856 --> 00:47:37.378]  People ask me if I'm worried about getting put in prison or getting killed.
[00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:39.459]  The truth is, no, I'm not.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.242]  I've had four children, and I love them more than life.
[00:47:46.683 --> 00:47:48.764]  And at certain levels, I'm guilty that I had them.
[00:47:49.564 --> 00:47:51.865]  But I have an instinct to have children, and I love my children.
[00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:55.747]  And so, I'm on a suicide mission.
[00:47:57.526 --> 00:47:59.126]  Suicide mission doesn't mean you want to die.
[00:47:59.146 --> 00:48:03.247]  It just means there's a 50% chance you're going to die on the mission.
[00:48:04.827 --> 00:48:10.828]  It's a real pleasure and an honor to be here and to be up against these evil people to defend innocence.
[00:48:11.208 --> 00:48:12.489]  Because that's my instinct.
[00:48:13.149 --> 00:48:14.369]  That's not what a hero does.
[00:48:15.209 --> 00:48:19.290]  That's what somebody does who's got their instincts lined up and who is dialed in.
[00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.370]  That's what a man does.
[00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:21.710]  That's what a woman does.
[00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.711]  That's what a free person does who's dialed in to God.
[00:48:25.828 --> 00:48:33.075]  Now I get frustrated because I'm so on fire to fight these people that I'm angry at myself actually every minute that I'm not doing a good enough job.
[00:48:34.637 --> 00:48:40.043]  And I think about that mindset versus people that don't give a damn and who aren't alive and it upsets me.
[00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:43.947]  But this audience and this crew are amazing and you do care.
[00:48:44.507 --> 00:48:46.730]  And so that's why I salute you and I always thank you.
[00:48:48.049 --> 00:48:49.891]  But I know this about other people that care.
[00:48:50.011 --> 00:48:51.632]  They're always over planning things.
[00:48:51.672 --> 00:48:53.414]  They're always trying to get it just right.
[00:48:54.054 --> 00:48:57.037]  And when we don't do things just right, we get really mad at ourselves.
[00:48:58.398 --> 00:49:00.981]  Because we feel like a lot of people are counting on us.
[00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:09.889]  But remember, sociopaths and psychopaths and mercenaries and control freaks, they have very little or no emotion.
[00:49:10.249 --> 00:49:12.351]  All they have is a feeling of power and triumph.
[00:49:13.507 --> 00:49:17.568]  They're very one-dimensional, very shallow, even though they have a high IQ.
[00:49:18.029 --> 00:49:21.250]  They're spiritually and emotionally deaf, dumb, and blind.
[00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:28.713]  And so, we need to stop over-worrying how we've got to carry things out perfectly.
[00:49:29.113 --> 00:49:32.234]  We've just got to swing for the fences and do the best job we can.
[00:49:34.485 --> 00:49:43.569]  I was thinking about this last night when I first heard about it, and then this morning when I was exercising, like 8.30 in the morning, I was watching Fox News, and we're going to play a clip of that right now.
[00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.011]  I was able to call the office, and they actually grabbed the very clip I was watching.
[00:49:48.692 --> 00:49:51.894]  When I heard this last week, I thought, I bet that's a false flag.
[00:49:54.095 --> 00:50:00.798]  Because the way they were acting, and there was something strange about it, and the way the press conferences were, and then the way it totally disappeared.
[00:50:02.768 --> 00:50:11.934]  And just the way the 9-1-1 and radio tape sounded, it just, the guy sounded too rehearsed.
[00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.656]  It sounded too calm.
[00:50:16.438 --> 00:50:19.820]  And then they tried to sweep it under the rug, but it didn't work.
[00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:29.447]  So I'll give this clip in a moment of the latest false flag that's been exposed, but it made me think of the hundreds and hundreds of admitted false flags
[00:50:31.018 --> 00:50:42.122]  That Breitbart.com has done the best job of writing articles and compilations about over a hundred confirmed staged events a year in the U.S.
[00:50:42.182 --> 00:50:42.483]  alone.
[00:50:43.223 --> 00:50:48.545]  I mean, people really don't go draw the N-word at the Air Force Academy all over the vending machines.
[00:50:49.025 --> 00:50:51.206]  People don't do that at West Point.
[00:50:52.126 --> 00:50:56.048]  No one's doing that at the Naval Academy, but all of them have it happen.
[00:50:56.991 --> 00:51:02.736]  Because the leftist professors tell people to do it, to create a culture where the left can take over.
[00:51:03.356 --> 00:51:12.063]  People are trying to get perfect scores at the Air Force Academy, and at West Point, and all these other systems.
[00:51:12.123 --> 00:51:23.712]  They are not trying to run around drawing N-words, and poop swastikas, and one-foot tall crosses, and churches being burned, and synagogues being attacked 99% of the time
[00:51:27.492 --> 00:51:28.213]  It's a staged event.
[00:51:28.233 --> 00:51:31.335]  Remember when Trump was first getting into office, he had to do a special State of the Union.
[00:51:31.776 --> 00:51:43.325]  They were saying he was anti-semitic, because he said, well, I'm hearing from investigators in New Jersey that it's a leftist attacking the synagogues and knocking over the gravestones at Jewish cemeteries.
[00:51:45.247 --> 00:51:46.167]  And it was a big crisis.
[00:51:46.207 --> 00:51:46.948]  He's anti-semitic.
[00:51:46.968 --> 00:51:48.049]  He says there's not anti-semitism.
[00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:51.131]  Turned out it was a leftist Jew doing it to blame Trump.
[00:51:53.994 --> 00:51:54.154]  So,
[00:51:56.052 --> 00:51:59.234]  I almost want to make a documentary, but I never have the time and energy or the crew to do it.
[00:52:00.695 --> 00:52:02.877]  But just about all the little false flags.
[00:52:03.717 --> 00:52:07.459]  I mean, I was in Lucy's Chicken this year because my wife wanted some oysters.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:14.123]  And they walked by my table three times saying they're going to kill me and I need to eat crap and all this stuff, trying to make me blow up.
[00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.205]  The second time, I call the manager over.
[00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:17.325]  They catch him again.
[00:52:17.586 --> 00:52:18.886]  They go, tell him don't do it again.
[00:52:19.107 --> 00:52:20.848]  They're waiting for me outside the door.
[00:52:21.664 --> 00:52:22.724]  This is an outside eating area.
[00:52:22.864 --> 00:52:26.505]  They got the seats right where I'd come out, videotaping when I walk out.
[00:52:26.945 --> 00:52:28.226]  I pull my camera, I start taping.
[00:52:28.546 --> 00:52:32.887]  It's on national news and I just walk over to tables and start screaming at people.
[00:52:34.967 --> 00:52:43.349]  No, they're saying, we're gonna kill you, eat crap, we hate you, um... We're gonna get you.
[00:52:43.369 --> 00:52:46.310]  I finally just said, well come on then!
[00:52:48.066 --> 00:52:50.529]  But again, the statesman went over there and found out it was fake.
[00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:53.012]  That indeed, the manager said, no, they messed with him three times.
[00:52:55.355 --> 00:52:56.657]  We caught him a second and third time.
[00:52:57.318 --> 00:52:58.199]  We kicked them out.
[00:52:59.366 --> 00:53:00.126]  It's not about me.
[00:53:00.947 --> 00:53:06.569]  The left at the lowest levels now are a pack of lying scum who will set you up.
[00:53:06.869 --> 00:53:08.570]  Their religion is false flagged.
[00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:13.112]  And Antifa in Ohio and Antifa in Texas, both of them were Antifa.
[00:53:13.272 --> 00:53:16.293]  They covered up the guy's page in Texas.
[00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:20.435]  Antifa is now going to stage terror attacks to blame us.
[00:53:20.615 --> 00:53:21.015]  Period.
[00:53:26.707 --> 00:53:28.468]  And Trump needs to cover it and talk about it.
[00:53:28.508 --> 00:53:29.489]  So here's the latest.
[00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:34.393]  This sheriff's cadet, who had just become a sheriff's deputy, he's in trouble.
[00:53:37.595 --> 00:53:39.337]  He's about to get kicked off the force.
[00:53:40.618 --> 00:53:43.220]  So he claims he's been shot by a sniper.
[00:53:44.517 --> 00:53:46.698]  And then I guess he just pokes a little knife hole in himself.
[00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:48.339]  Like, people think that's a bullet hole.
[00:53:49.019 --> 00:53:50.400]  No, son, that's a millimeter deep.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.340]  That's not a rifle hole.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.221]  That'd be right through you, you jackass.
[00:53:53.922 --> 00:53:57.323]  But that shows who they're recruiting and hiring in police forces in some areas.
[00:54:00.665 --> 00:54:02.726]  So, most of this is made up, folks.
[00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:04.447]  And now they want to sweep it under the rug.
[00:54:04.727 --> 00:54:06.387]  Here's the Fox News report on L.A.
[00:54:06.407 --> 00:54:07.068]  Sheriff's Deputy.
[00:54:07.368 --> 00:54:09.169]  Completely fabricated sniper story.
[00:54:09.529 --> 00:54:10.930]  Has been fired, authorities say.
[00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:11.290]  Here it is.
[00:54:22.723 --> 00:54:28.908]  Authorities saying the Los Angeles County deputy in that frantic radio call lied about the whole thing.
[00:54:29.148 --> 00:54:37.435]  Last week, the 21-year-old claimed he was shot by a sniper while walking to his car, prompting a huge police response.
[00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:40.217]  He now faces a criminal investigation.
[00:54:40.257 --> 00:54:43.160]  William Lajeunesse is live in Los Angeles with the latest.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:43.440]  William?
[00:54:45.083 --> 00:54:56.894]  Well Sandra, you remember this shooting happened last Wednesday around 3 in the afternoon and only on Saturday night did the Sheriff's Department admit this entire story was a hoax and now that ex-deputy is in big trouble.
[00:54:58.575 --> 00:55:02.859]  The investigation is ongoing and a criminal investigation has been launched.
[00:55:04.481 --> 00:55:07.604]  We intend on relieving Deputy Angel Reynoso of his duties.
[00:55:09.741 --> 00:55:19.329]  So all last week, the department acted as if this massive manhunt was still underway, when in fact, detectives working the case suspected this was a lie about six hours after it happened.
[00:55:19.569 --> 00:55:19.869]  Why?
[00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:23.232]  One, you had a crowd in a parking lot, but not a single witness.
[00:55:23.652 --> 00:55:28.496]  Reynosa claimed two shots were fired, but detectives found no bullets, no casings, no ricochets.
[00:55:28.917 --> 00:55:32.780]  No one heard, in the apartment complex or anywhere else, a shot.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:41.807]  Reynosa admitted on Saturday to using a knife to cut holes in his shirt to look like a bullet hole, but investigators say the rips were too big for an entry wound.
[00:55:42.108 --> 00:55:47.412]  And finally, detectives said Reynosa sounded too normal in that 911 call.
[00:55:47.472 --> 00:55:50.014]  They expected to hear more adrenaline in his voice.
[00:55:51.876 --> 00:55:57.601]  There was no sniper, no shots fired, and no gunshot injury sustained to his shoulder.
[00:55:58.462 --> 00:55:59.283]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:55:59.463 --> 00:56:02.386]  And again, earlier reports was he had a little cut on him.
[00:56:03.067 --> 00:56:04.108]  But even that wasn't true.
[00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:05.549]  Now, here's the key.
[00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.273]  This happened a long time ago, over a week ago.
[00:56:10.414 --> 00:56:12.016]  They knew immediately it was fake.
[00:56:12.676 --> 00:56:13.697]  Oh, where's the bullet hole?
[00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:15.879]  Where's the witnesses?
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.683]  But everyone played along with it, saying, see, there's snipers now.
[00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.959]  And we need to take your guns and all the rest of it.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.482]  And so that just shows how they always believe right away all this.
[00:56:26.863 --> 00:56:28.664]  That's why I questioned Sandy Hook.
[00:56:30.586 --> 00:56:35.411]  Because I saw them lie to get us into the first Iraq war, saying they were killing hundreds of babies in incubators.
[00:56:35.671 --> 00:56:36.672]  It turned out it was totally fake!
[00:56:39.403 --> 00:56:41.123]  And so, the public questions things.
[00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:42.144]  I question things.
[00:56:42.164 --> 00:56:42.584]  We have a right.
[00:56:42.604 --> 00:56:43.544]  Look at Jesse Smollett.
[00:56:43.844 --> 00:56:44.784]  Look at any of this stuff.
[00:56:44.804 --> 00:56:48.905]  But they don't want you to have the capability or the ability to ask questions.
[00:56:48.925 --> 00:56:50.645]  They want to shut that down.
[00:56:50.665 --> 00:56:52.245]  They want to end the First Amendment.
[00:56:52.265 --> 00:56:53.686]  And that is insanely dangerous.
[00:56:54.146 --> 00:56:54.406]  Okay.
[00:56:55.146 --> 00:57:00.287]  There's a ton of other news that I'm not going to mention now that I'm going to hit in the first 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:57:00.307 --> 00:57:05.588]  Then we have a special guest, Count Dankula, who was arrested for a Hitler dog joke.
[00:57:07.148 --> 00:57:09.150]  Wait till you hear about all the other arrests.
[00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.591]  A man put on the side of his house.
[00:57:12.213 --> 00:57:13.434]  Islam is questionable.
[00:57:13.754 --> 00:57:14.535]  He's been arrested.
[00:57:15.596 --> 00:57:23.062]  A woman that's a vegan said halal butchering of animals is inhumane.
[00:57:24.604 --> 00:57:26.165]  And she's been kicked out of college.
[00:57:26.646 --> 00:57:27.626]  This is just the latest.
[00:57:27.686 --> 00:57:31.210]  Thousands of arrests a year for saying that Islam is violent.
[00:57:32.259 --> 00:57:37.805]  Or exposing that they're running racially focused rape gangs against British girls and others.
[00:57:39.006 --> 00:57:39.887]  It's all coming up.
[00:57:40.508 --> 00:57:42.770]  Hour number two is only minutes away.
[00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:46.494]  And the only way we crush the globalists is when you spread the live links and spread the word.
[00:57:46.934 --> 00:57:48.156]  Your word of mouth is key.
[00:57:48.576 --> 00:57:49.978]  And it is unstoppable.
[00:57:54.932 --> 00:57:57.694]  So let's go to Allen from Ohio.
[00:57:57.854 --> 00:57:58.994]  He wants to talk about DNA Force.
[00:57:59.114 --> 00:58:00.495]  Hi, can you hear me?
[00:58:00.675 --> 00:58:01.456]  Yes, loud and clear.
[00:58:01.656 --> 00:58:02.076]  Oh, good.
[00:58:02.256 --> 00:58:03.717]  It's an honor to talk to you guys.
[00:58:03.837 --> 00:58:04.838]  I don't miss the broadcast.
[00:58:04.918 --> 00:58:06.479]  So DNA Force, okay.
[00:58:06.579 --> 00:58:09.981]  I broke my neck 16 years ago, you know, in a skiing accident.
[00:58:10.141 --> 00:58:16.405]  I was paralyzed from the neck down only for a short period of time, like the first hour after the, you know, after the accident.
[00:58:16.465 --> 00:58:20.287]  But I experienced that and I had a knife hardware in my neck.
[00:58:20.487 --> 00:58:21.228]  Multiple plate.
[00:58:21.368 --> 00:58:24.190]  And anyway, it did all right for like 12, 13 years.
[00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:31.014]  And about two years ago, I started having the most incredible nerve pain down my arms, especially my left arm pulsing.
[00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.355]  And you can't imagine the pain.
[00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:33.856]  It was like I had rebroke my neck.
[00:58:33.936 --> 00:58:37.078]  I went and got MRI to see if my hardware was OK.
[00:58:37.118 --> 00:58:40.501]  And I missed the whole process of seeing a doctor and everything took a month or two.
[00:58:40.681 --> 00:58:43.042]  And they scheduled me for these pain shots.
[00:58:43.122 --> 00:58:44.443]  They were just going to deaden the nerve.
[00:58:44.563 --> 00:58:45.484]  It was so painful.
[00:58:45.684 --> 00:58:46.425]  I couldn't take it.
[00:58:46.605 --> 00:58:48.166]  So anyway, I was waiting for my shots.
[00:58:48.266 --> 00:58:48.586]  I missed
[00:58:48.666 --> 00:58:49.627]  We're good to go.
[00:59:08.507 --> 00:59:09.127]  That is amazing.
[00:59:25.933 --> 00:59:26.293]  You know what?
[00:59:26.433 --> 00:59:31.356]  When I talk about the products, that's one of the things I'm always focused on is how well they work.
[00:59:31.516 --> 00:59:33.977]  You know, they actually, they actually work.
[00:59:34.077 --> 00:59:38.479]  It's not something that, you know, let's get it and just, you know, take it and whatever, hope for the best.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.200]  I mean, they actually work.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.721]  And hey, thank you for the call.
[00:59:41.941 --> 00:59:46.984]  And because of people like you, the reason why Harrison and myself get to sit here today.
[00:59:56.531 --> 01:00:00.695]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:43.305]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up next segment, it's all over mainstream news that Silicon Valley is building a social credit score to punish you for things you do outside of the platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[01:00:43.805 --> 01:00:47.027]  Of course, they've been building it for the Chi-Coms, and now they're building it for you.
[01:00:47.407 --> 01:00:48.567]  InfoWars first told you in 2015.
[01:00:48.607 --> 01:00:50.268]  Next year's news today, indeed.
[01:00:54.574 --> 01:00:58.175]  Because we're all in this together, ladies and gentlemen, and we can beat them.
[01:00:58.235 --> 01:00:59.335]  We know their battle plans.
[01:00:59.796 --> 01:01:01.536]  We know how to stop them.
[01:01:02.136 --> 01:01:05.017]  I'd be covering it this segment, but I have so many stacks of news.
[01:01:05.057 --> 01:01:12.059]  I can't find the articles that the crew brought me where it's all admitted that Silicon Valley is building this.
[01:01:12.099 --> 01:01:14.000]  I'm going to see if I can find that.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.061]  And then there's a bunch of new Epstein news.
[01:01:16.901 --> 01:01:22.043]  There is a bunch of new Joe Biden says, I want to be clear, I'm not going nuts.
[01:01:22.103 --> 01:01:23.003]  That's an actual quote.
[01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:24.643]  Well, we have that video.
[01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:28.645]  We've got a bunch of stuff out of Hong Kong we haven't gotten to.
[01:01:29.525 --> 01:01:30.205]  And so much more.
[01:01:30.245 --> 01:01:31.086]  And some good news.
[01:01:31.986 --> 01:01:34.467]  Cities are saying no to 5G health.
[01:01:36.528 --> 01:01:37.388]  That's the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:37.408 --> 01:01:38.708]  That was a direct counter.
[01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:42.170]  A direct counter the day after Drudge.
[01:01:43.427 --> 01:01:47.408]  Promoted that I was live on air, uh, covering the dangers of 5G.
[01:01:47.428 --> 01:01:49.268]  Uh, they came out with this.
[01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:51.369]  So that's going to be coming up next segment.
[01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:53.590]  Plus this great ad from Merv's guns.
[01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:58.311]  We're actually going to come in with that first, uh, at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:07.053]  Uh, separately here, there's just so much that I need to get to, but I think we should play clip number five because it's such a good report.
[01:02:07.093 --> 01:02:11.674]  I don't normally air reports once or more than once.
[01:02:13.632 --> 01:02:15.854]  I normally air them, and they're really, really, really, really good, twice.
[01:02:15.894 --> 01:02:18.016]  But I've aired this already twice.
[01:02:18.156 --> 01:02:30.007]  I want to air Chai Kom's plan for Hong Kong invasion revealed, because our report, Greg Rees, and of course Savannah Hernandez and others, are there inside Hong Kong right now filing amazing reports.
[01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:33.150]  But this boils down to why it's so incredibly important.
[01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:33.471]  Here it is.
[01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:38.551]  This is Greg Reese reporting from mainland China for InfoWars.com.
[01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:42.974]  Behind me here is the start of the HKZM Bridge.
[01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:55.183]  Opened less than one year ago, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is 34 miles long, consisting of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel, and four artificial islands.
[01:02:55.843 --> 01:02:58.365]  It is the longest open-sea fixed link on Earth.
[01:02:58.825 --> 01:03:01.267]  The bridge links the mainland to Hong Kong.
[01:03:01.827 --> 01:03:05.270]  This is the bridge the Chai Kams are going to use to invade Hong Kong.
[01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:15.679]  Reporter Savannah Hernandez is reporting on the upcoming elections that are already fixed, where only one candidate who stands for Beijing rule over Macau is set to win the election.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.763]  First comes Macau, second comes Hong Kong, and this is the breach.
[01:03:24.102 --> 01:03:33.111]  After World War II, we saw the rise of communism in the Soviet Union and in the People's Republic of China.
[01:03:33.692 --> 01:03:43.281]  In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution, led by Party Chairman Mao Zedong, was responsible for the murder of over 100 million Chinese.
[01:03:45.544 --> 01:03:58.396]  Millions of others fled the mainland into Taiwan and Hong Kong, which as a result, grew into thriving societies as mainland China plunged into darkness.
[01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:06.864]  2019, the 70-year anniversary of the Communist Revolution, and despite its horrors, communism continues to spread.
[01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:17.577]  The People's Republic is a model for globalized governance, and the Communist Chinese are now looking to absorb those who fled 70 years ago.
[01:04:17.597 --> 01:04:29.687]  100,000 troops of the CHICOM's paramilitary PAF are now training on the border of these autonomous cities, preparing for an invasion.
[01:04:33.146 --> 01:04:38.207]  And the people of Hong Kong are united against this tyrannical cancer.
[01:04:41.308 --> 01:04:45.089]  Right behind me is mainland China, separated by this small waterway.
[01:04:45.489 --> 01:04:54.651]  With over 100,000 troops already amassed, set to invade, only a fraction of the people's armed force, the Chi-Coms are preparing for Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[01:04:56.692 --> 01:05:01.293]  Reporting from mainland China, for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:06.713]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:05:06.773 --> 01:05:11.235]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.636]  It's super silver skin cream.
[01:05:13.716 --> 01:05:17.398]  It's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.
[01:05:17.578 --> 01:05:18.419]  It's brand new.
[01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:19.279]  People are going to love it.
[01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:21.981]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream, exclusively at

[01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:11.162]  But one day I woke up like maybe I'll do it differently.
[01:06:11.222 --> 01:06:14.844]  So I moved to California but it's just a state of mind.
[01:06:14.864 --> 01:06:18.627]  Turns out everywhere you go you take yourself that's not alive.
[01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:22.509]  Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine.
[01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:26.811]  It's killing me slowly.
[01:06:28.252 --> 01:06:31.874]  Dream a little dream of me.
[01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:34.096]  Meet me in the sun this week.
[01:06:35.609 --> 01:06:39.370]  Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song.
[01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:43.850]  Fuck it, I like you.
[01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:48.991]  Fuck it, I like you.
[01:06:49.351 --> 01:06:54.792]  Fuck it, I like you.
[01:06:54.952 --> 01:06:56.633]  I really do.
[01:06:56.753 --> 01:07:00.533]  I used to shoot up my veins with neon.
[01:07:01.553 --> 01:07:04.134]  Shit's even brighter, you're gone.
[01:07:05.131 --> 01:07:09.594]  So many things I want to say to you.
[01:07:09.614 --> 01:07:13.837]  I want to put a gallop on you, but it's just a state of mind.
[01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:17.600]  And you know everyone that does it, you can feel it in your side.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:27.247]  I maybe wish that you would hold me, or just say that you're mine, but it's killing me slow.
[01:07:27.287 --> 01:07:30.930]  Dream a little dream of me.
[01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:33.211]  Turn this into something sweet.
[01:07:34.628 --> 01:07:37.817]  Turn the radio on, dancin' to a love song.
[01:07:40.834 --> 01:07:56.857]  Contributor Marcy Bianco, a self-described writer, editor, cultural critic, and your favorite lesbian feminist, recently wrote this in her piece titled, Miley Cyrus's split with Liam Hemsworth isn't just celebrity gossip, it's a blow to the patriarchy.
[01:07:57.077 --> 01:08:02.598]  Quote, men need heterosexuality to maintain their societal dominance over women.
[01:08:02.838 --> 01:08:08.719]  Women, on the other hand, are increasingly realizing not only that they don't need heterosexuality,
[01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:13.541]  But that it also is often the bedrock of their global oppression.
[01:08:13.661 --> 01:08:29.889]  The nonsensical radical idea that women are increasingly realizing that they don't need healthy heterosexual relationships based on the lifestyle of Miley Cyrus, whose divorce was inevitable, wasn't because Miley was victimized by global oppression,
[01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:34.830]  It was due to her inability to maintain a healthy heterosexual relationship.
[01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:48.713]  Some women just aren't ready or willing to take on the raw reality required of a partner in a caring monogamous relationship emboldened by the synthesis of matriarchal and patriarchal norms in the Western world.
[01:08:48.973 --> 01:08:53.193]  Bianco was echoing a message bubbling amongst feminists for years.
[01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:55.814]  We need to kill all men.
[01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:04.445]  I am sick of being a baby factory that produces more men that will just, in the future, subjugate me.
[01:09:05.305 --> 01:09:15.309]  So, the only answer to that is to kill male babies and just kill any man that you see, like, in the streets.
[01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:16.490]  Like, any swing s***.
[01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:17.070]  Just kill him.
[01:09:19.987 --> 01:09:27.297]  Um, we want the species to go on, but we want it only to go on with women in it.
[01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.701]  So, that's what we have to do.
[01:09:30.761 --> 01:09:34.365]  That's the only way to keep the human race going, is with just women.
[01:09:35.228 --> 01:09:38.571]  This is the rabid underbelly of the diatribe among the left.
[01:09:38.971 --> 01:09:47.398]  And if heterosexuality is on a sharp decline, as Marcy Bianco claims, wouldn't a straight pride parade make sense and draw support?
[01:09:47.898 --> 01:09:51.361]  A large crowd forms on McHenry Street in Modesto.
[01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:57.146]  People holding signs, making noise, and speaking out against this man, Don Grundman.
[01:09:57.446 --> 01:10:00.428]  For weeks, he's advertised having a straight pride event.
[01:10:00.609 --> 01:10:03.031]  This is an example of free speech in our country.
[01:10:03.191 --> 01:10:04.211]  It's a one-way street.
[01:10:05.152 --> 01:10:09.034]  They want free speech, but they won't give us free speech.
[01:10:09.194 --> 01:10:18.459]  When he showed up this afternoon, people against his message say they wanted to outnumber him, surrounding his sign promoting the Straight Pride Coalition.
[01:10:18.739 --> 01:10:25.822]  Apathy and not confronting fascists when they come into society, into the public space, into our communities.
[01:10:26.263 --> 01:10:30.465]  It makes it unsafe for queer people, people of color.
[01:10:30.905 --> 01:10:40.836]  The actual reality is that 2.2% of the American male population identifies as gay, while 1.1% identifies lesbian.
[01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:50.067]  And it's not because the LGBT community is oppressed, as 63% of Americans believe homosexuality is morally acceptable.
[01:10:50.307 --> 01:11:01.770]  But what is actually increasing is an epidemic trend of loneliness, as a general social survey discovered that the number of Americans with no close friends has tripled since 1985.
[01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:05.791]  In fact, a study published in the U.S.
[01:11:05.851 --> 01:11:09.072]  National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health
[01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:17.719]  Revealed that characteristics of socially isolated patients with coronary artery disease are at an elevated risk for mortality.
[01:11:17.999 --> 01:11:20.621]  Simply put, loneliness is killing us.
[01:11:20.861 --> 01:11:39.036]  And as those numbers skyrocket, Mockingbird mainstream media outlets irresponsibly seed the mental illness of pseudo-racism, nationalized self-loathing, and radical feminism, compounding the isolation, echoing the projection of the fears of the LGBT community.
[01:11:39.036 --> 01:11:41.456]  Now, there's some big new developments taking place.
[01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:11.574]  On a lot of different fronts with the attacks on free speech.
[01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:21.559]  We're going to have Count Dankula in studio who they tried to put in prison if he wouldn't renounce himself and say he was a bad person for doing a Hitler dog joke.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.862]  I did a Hitler dog joke with my late French bulldog.
[01:12:26.802 --> 01:12:36.088]  But now people putting signs on their barns that say questioning Islam is okay are being arrested, prosecuted, thrown in jail, thrown in prison.
[01:12:37.526 --> 01:12:42.229]  And men and women that criticize how all slaughter are being kicked out of college.
[01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:43.429]  They're being arrested.
[01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:51.354]  Islam is the absolutely protected class being brought in to engage in predator activity against the population.
[01:12:51.914 --> 01:13:00.019]  I was at dinner last night with Sargon and of course with Count Dankula.
[01:13:01.696 --> 01:13:09.181]  And both of them were basically afraid to be on camera talking about all the people they know that are arrested because they will be arrested.
[01:13:10.341 --> 01:13:18.667]  So, Tommy Robinson's in jail for exposing child kidnapping rings that target white girls, mainly by Pakistani men.
[01:13:19.147 --> 01:13:20.488]  They don't do it to the Pakistani girls.
[01:13:21.588 --> 01:13:22.649]  They kill many of them.
[01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:24.910]  We're talking 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 year old.
[01:13:25.391 --> 01:13:27.092]  And they're supplying them to men like
[01:13:28.459 --> 01:13:29.119]  Jimmy Savelle.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:37.123]  And so it's a very ghoulish relationship with the globalist ruling class in the UK and the Islamicists who agree with all of this culture.
[01:13:37.143 --> 01:13:38.003]  That's the bottom of the arm.
[01:13:39.463 --> 01:13:44.005]  I'll hit the Merv's Guns ad that I mentioned earlier when we start the next segment.
[01:13:44.566 --> 01:13:48.947]  Just briefly, people are really excited about this because they know what a great product it is.
[01:13:49.548 --> 01:13:51.989]  We have the Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:56.670]  It's patented, FDA approved, strongest silver you can get over the counter.
[01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:57.711]  We're the only company
[01:13:58.848 --> 01:13:59.028]  Let's go.
[01:14:14.062 --> 01:14:23.867]  Have the same silver, but they don't have all the jump-through-the-hoops stuff to have that FDA label on them, so we can get a better price on them, and so we can lower the price, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:23.907 --> 01:14:31.231]  We're talking $7 for the small tube, $14 for the big tube, two different designs, two different variants of it.
[01:14:31.971 --> 01:14:39.115]  It's amazing, and it just doesn't have the patented nano-silver, silver-sol technology that recognizes the best.
[01:14:39.835 --> 01:14:46.697]  With just 20 ppm silver, it's up to 10 times more effective in major studies than similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:48.578]  This stuff is the real deal.
[01:14:48.598 --> 01:14:54.019]  Get the Super Silver Skin Cream, 25% off at introductoryspecialinforestore.com.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.401]  And again, it also helps reduce wrinkles and keeps the skin healthy.
[01:14:59.221 --> 01:15:02.062]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick on contact.
[01:15:02.902 --> 01:15:03.903]  It's best of both worlds.
[01:15:04.283 --> 01:15:08.386]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Salt technology.
[01:15:08.867 --> 01:15:23.237]  It also is loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil and vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[01:15:23.658 --> 01:15:29.242]  Independent studies have proven that Silver Salt technology is Super Silver Skin Cream, which is 20 ppm again.
[01:15:29.462 --> 01:15:29.783]  We're good.
[01:15:40.731 --> 01:15:41.411]  To a week and a half.
[01:15:41.431 --> 01:15:42.752]  We're gonna have to go back to regular price.
[01:15:43.332 --> 01:15:43.913]  Earns a few days.
[01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:46.134]  Just like the super krill oil.
[01:15:46.974 --> 01:15:48.315]  Highest quality, ultimate krill oil.
[01:15:48.755 --> 01:15:49.275]  This baby.
[01:15:49.335 --> 01:15:50.576]  We're doubling the reorder of this.
[01:15:50.616 --> 01:15:52.277]  People are learning how incredible krill oil is.
[01:15:52.857 --> 01:15:54.638]  And it's back at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:15:54.698 --> 01:15:55.679]  It's still discounted as well.
[01:15:55.999 --> 01:15:57.079]  We gotta end that discount.
[01:15:57.179 --> 01:15:57.500]  Okay.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.400]  Stay with us.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:00.041]  The transmission has just begun.
[01:16:03.413 --> 01:16:09.198]  We were winning, Antifa was over, the culture wars had been won, it was time to gloat.
[01:16:10.039 --> 01:16:13.482]  We were winning the meme war, everyone was laughing.
[01:16:14.483 --> 01:16:20.348]  And then you get depersoned to the point where you don't exist.
[01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:22.169]  Like Laura Loomer had to leave New York.
[01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:25.312]  She's living in a place I don't think I can even say.
[01:16:25.332 --> 01:16:28.134]  Across from a police station so they can get there fast.
[01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:31.497]  Steven Crowder's had to move many times.
[01:16:32.017 --> 01:16:33.458]  Dana Lash's had to move.
[01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:36.520]  And when these people move, they don't make it a slow decision.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.222]  They have to pack up in the middle of the night.
[01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:42.885]  I'm gonna have to move.
[01:16:42.945 --> 01:16:44.947]  Tommy Robertson's has to move.
[01:16:46.008 --> 01:16:47.549]  And he has done so several times.
[01:16:49.986 --> 01:17:06.268]  So, I think you have these negligent, family-less media sources trivializing these allegations because it makes for a salacious headline, but they don't realize that they endanger people's lives, and like, they put these people's children in danger.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:13.505]  You know, Dana Lash's kids have a, have a, you know, most, most, actually I shouldn't just say Dana Lash.
[01:17:14.126 --> 01:17:22.854]  Most of these conservatives have spoken to their principals about attack plans and what happens if there's a threat to the school, not to the school, but to the student or something like that.
[01:17:24.543 --> 01:17:32.465]  So, it's a strange dichotomy where you have this incredibly severe punishment for the right.
[01:17:33.405 --> 01:17:36.666]  But the people doling out the punishment are these flaky babysitters.
[01:17:37.347 --> 01:17:40.027]  Like the SPLC can shut down my life.
[01:17:40.747 --> 01:17:44.428]  And then you read their articles and it says, you want bigots, Gavin?
[01:17:44.448 --> 01:17:45.449]  This is how you get bigots.
[01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:47.429]  Talking like a bratty babysitter.
[01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:49.730]  So, you have
[01:17:51.178 --> 01:17:55.999]  You have someone who wants to replace the judicial system, basically, with their own kangaroo court.
[01:17:56.659 --> 01:18:00.861]  SPLC's like that, AVO's like that, the media's like that, they're judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:07.462]  And you think, okay, if you're going to take over hundreds of years of justice, you better be real thorough.
[01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:12.183]  Because you're basically saying you're better than millions of people in hundreds of years.
[01:18:12.464 --> 01:18:13.464]  Maybe thousands of years.
[01:18:14.384 --> 01:18:15.924]  And then they're so flippant about it.
[01:18:16.485 --> 01:18:18.325]  So they're doing this the same with conservatives.
[01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:24.647]  They're just sort of assuming someone said something, taking out the context, and then just destroying them.
[01:18:24.687 --> 01:18:28.287]  But it's been an underhanded trick of warfare for a long time.
[01:18:28.348 --> 01:18:31.428]  I mean, the English did it to the Americans in the American Revolution.
[01:18:31.908 --> 01:18:34.309]  The English did it to the Boers in the Boer War.
[01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:39.210]  It's a common trick that the weak people do.
[01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:41.831]  It's a common trick people do who don't have families.
[01:18:42.931 --> 01:18:51.598]  And so they say, I'm going to call this guy a Nazi without thinking that his son is going to get, you know, accosted due to these rumors.
[01:18:52.559 --> 01:18:53.739]  I don't think they really believe it.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:00.104]  When they talk about white supremacy, I don't believe them that they think it's a big threat.
[01:19:01.005 --> 01:19:03.727]  I think they're just, it's a game to them.
[01:19:04.568 --> 01:19:08.351]  And it's kind of the problem with the death of the family is everything becomes a silly game.
[01:19:09.472 --> 01:19:12.653]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:19:13.533 --> 01:19:14.553]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:19.294]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:19:22.254 --> 01:19:25.375]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:19:25.395 --> 01:19:26.435]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:19:26.455 --> 01:19:31.036]  The high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:19:31.136 --> 01:19:37.837]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:19:42.466 --> 01:19:45.928]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:19:54.072 --> 01:19:55.313]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:19:58.015 --> 01:19:59.075]  You can't watch this.
[01:19:59.395 --> 01:19:59.836]  The movie.
[01:20:00.036 --> 01:20:02.797]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:20:06.339 --> 01:20:08.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.009 --> 01:20:29.592]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:29.612 --> 01:20:31.232]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.272 --> 01:20:39.895]  There's nothing like having people on the ground to verify.
[01:20:41.015 --> 01:20:43.256]  But even mainstream media got it right.
[01:20:44.332 --> 01:20:50.245]  The millions of protesters that have been out in the streets last week in Hong Kong
[01:20:51.573 --> 01:21:08.584]  Are mainly mad about the face scanning cameras and the Chinese social score that tracks every movement they make and then gives orders to government councils and to corporations to not let you have jobs, not let you have credit cards, not let you ride trains, not let you get on airplanes, not let you leave your house.
[01:21:09.144 --> 01:21:14.468]  That's a statement by the Communist Party that if you don't do what we say you will not set foot two feet outside your door.
[01:21:15.968 --> 01:21:19.391]  A total global electronic straitjacket
[01:21:20.253 --> 01:21:21.854]  Hooked over everyone.
[01:21:23.055 --> 01:21:42.771]  And now today, there's a whole group of mainstream news articles introducing this to everyone, getting everyone ready for it, preparing everyone for it, telling people that the Chinese social score is here
[01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:47.423]  Here's a couple articles on it right now.
[01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:48.764]  Uh-oh!
[01:21:49.345 --> 01:21:53.308]  Silicon Valley's building a Chinese-style social credit score.
[01:21:53.328 --> 01:21:58.393]  That's FastCompany.com, and it links to all these mainstream articles.
[01:21:59.834 --> 01:22:01.576]  And then it goes on to other articles.
[01:22:02.576 --> 01:22:06.240]  The Observer, America isn't far from China's social credit score.
[01:22:07.247 --> 01:22:12.653]  I have another article here in my stack where Silicon Valley is meeting to develop a social credit score.
[01:22:12.693 --> 01:22:13.374]  It's already here.
[01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:14.635]  Alex Jones is right again.
[01:22:14.695 --> 01:22:17.218]  Big Tech building Chinese style social credit score.
[01:22:17.238 --> 01:22:18.439]  I wasn't right again.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:23.664]  Everyone keeps thinking, oh, he was right about Epstein.
[01:22:23.684 --> 01:22:25.807]  He envisioned it with a crystal ball.
[01:22:27.256 --> 01:22:30.038]  Or he was right about fluoride causing IQ reduction.
[01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:35.803]  Or he was right about the runoff making the frogs be attracted to the same sex and killing them.
[01:22:36.363 --> 01:22:37.084]  They never have babies.
[01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:38.705]  That means end of species.
[01:22:40.427 --> 01:22:41.227]  And he was right about this.
[01:22:41.548 --> 01:22:43.129]  Because it's already admitted.
[01:22:43.169 --> 01:22:48.013]  There were already thousands of studies that fluoride lowers IQ and hurts fertility.
[01:22:48.813 --> 01:22:55.499]  There are already hundreds of studies that the runoff is making the frogs attracted to the same sex and not females anymore.
[01:22:56.803 --> 01:23:01.727]  There's even mainstream headlines before I ever said, turn the frogs gay, that said it's making them homosexual.
[01:23:04.049 --> 01:23:07.192]  And then of course, Facebook was not going to let you use keywords.
[01:23:08.273 --> 01:23:09.594]  First it's Alex Jones.
[01:23:12.036 --> 01:23:13.778]  Then it's, what is it next?
[01:23:14.399 --> 01:23:15.099]  It's InfoWars.
[01:23:15.119 --> 01:23:16.180]  Then it's Paul Watson.
[01:23:17.181 --> 01:23:17.822]  Then it's...
[01:23:18.996 --> 01:23:20.316]  Even Donald Trump, if they want.
[01:23:20.936 --> 01:23:22.497]  And people are finally getting this.
[01:23:23.237 --> 01:23:27.197]  When I saw this over the weekend, or on Friday, I thought that it was a joke.
[01:23:27.738 --> 01:23:31.618]  But it turns out that there is a gun store in Oklahoma that's been around for decades.
[01:23:32.698 --> 01:23:33.459]  Murph's Guns.
[01:23:33.699 --> 01:23:34.819]  That's very, very popular.
[01:23:35.539 --> 01:23:37.379]  And it turns out it's even got Murph in it.
[01:23:37.439 --> 01:23:38.899]  Well, I want to have this guy on the show.
[01:23:39.179 --> 01:23:42.080]  I want to... This guy's got a lot of energy and a lot of pizazz.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.160]  But he turns it around on them.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:44.900]  But here's the thing.
[01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:47.521]  It's good to adapt and overcome censorship.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:52.303]  But if we just adapt to it with jokes, it's only a short-term issue.
[01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:56.747]  Because they're just gonna change it to say, well, you're still promoting guns.
[01:23:57.267 --> 01:24:03.552]  Imagine Facebook saying, you can't promote anything with the name gun in it, or shotgun, or handgun.
[01:24:05.253 --> 01:24:10.678]  And then AI is blocking it, and then AI with photos of guns is blurring it out.
[01:24:11.438 --> 01:24:12.619]  Just like they blur my face out.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.602]  So this is the total nightmare system.
[01:24:16.653 --> 01:24:18.354]  And it's here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:18.755 --> 01:24:22.717]  So here's the ad for the guns.
[01:24:22.737 --> 01:24:24.659]  And again, for radio, it won't be as cute.
[01:24:24.779 --> 01:24:27.361]  But for TV, they blurred all the guns out.
[01:24:28.341 --> 01:24:29.342]  And it says it all.
[01:24:29.382 --> 01:24:29.682]  Here it is.
[01:24:31.584 --> 01:24:32.645]  Howdy, folks!
[01:24:32.885 --> 01:24:38.389]  I'm here to tell you all about Murph's s**t. You see, Facebook won't let us use the word g**ds in any advertisements.
[01:24:38.569 --> 01:24:42.612]  They also won't let us show g**dshot g**ds or g**ds.
[01:24:44.059 --> 01:24:44.620]  Hippies!
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:49.624]  Here at Murph's Sh**, we got tons of stuff for all your outdoor and self-protection needs.
[01:24:49.924 --> 01:24:57.070]  So much so, that this is one of the only camera angles in the store that we can show you without violating Facebook's rules.
[01:24:58.131 --> 01:24:58.652]  Oh, see?
[01:24:59.152 --> 01:25:00.493]  We got it all!
[01:25:00.873 --> 01:25:04.276]  And in real life, none of the stuff in the store is covered up or blurry.
[01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:08.540]  We got a great selection of sh**, and sh**, and sh**, and sh**, and sh**, and sh**,
[01:25:11.718 --> 01:25:14.461]  I would definitely shop at Murph's Guns.
[01:25:14.521 --> 01:25:16.242]  I want to get that guy on.
[01:25:16.262 --> 01:25:16.342]  Now...
[01:25:38.055 --> 01:25:39.036]  That's people fighting back.
[01:25:39.076 --> 01:25:42.478]  But we can't put up with this to have our utilities.
[01:25:42.538 --> 01:25:45.781]  And under Section 230, Big Tech is all a utility.
[01:25:46.681 --> 01:25:51.725]  That's how they're able to have third-party comments or third-party articles and things and have billions of members.
[01:25:51.765 --> 01:25:53.467]  It's almost up to 3 billion now on Facebook.
[01:25:54.387 --> 01:25:56.769]  Because you're not liable for what they're posting.
[01:25:57.189 --> 01:26:01.433]  If it violates the law, then you take it down if there's a court order or someone's indicted.
[01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:06.404]  You have policies, you know, no child endangerment stuff, porn.
[01:26:08.085 --> 01:26:10.226]  You can say gambling, you can say hacking.
[01:26:11.987 --> 01:26:26.377]  But then, oh, we choose to say that the Republican Party putting out on Facebook a little photographic saying we're looking for strong women to join the campaign and help get Trump reelected.
[01:26:26.997 --> 01:26:29.979]  They said, well, that's misgendering, saying we're looking for strong women.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.981]  You can't say the word woman.
[01:26:33.442 --> 01:26:34.362]  That's not a mistake.
[01:26:34.382 --> 01:26:36.103]  That's a battle plan system.
[01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:38.724]  I first started learning 10 years ago out of Canada.
[01:26:39.124 --> 01:26:43.046]  They were trying to ban on entrance exams or entrance forms for public schools.
[01:26:43.366 --> 01:26:44.827]  And college is the word mother and father.
[01:26:45.987 --> 01:26:48.368]  Or he or she.
[01:26:48.548 --> 01:26:49.569]  Well now they've done that.
[01:26:49.809 --> 01:26:51.650]  They're not just saying there's 500 genders.
[01:26:52.290 --> 01:27:02.314]  They're saying you can't send an ad out that says strong women because it might hurt someone that sees the word woman because they're not a woman.
[01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:04.851]  You're like, that just sounds like total mental illness.
[01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:08.933]  Well, they're creating basket cases that are offended by anything and everything.
[01:27:09.593 --> 01:27:10.594]  Then run back to mommy.
[01:27:11.174 --> 01:27:14.176]  And the police are all told to be politically correct and go out and throw the book at everybody.
[01:27:14.556 --> 01:27:18.678]  You know, that puts up a sign on their barn saying, Islam is questionable.
[01:27:19.739 --> 01:27:22.340]  Or hey, torturing animals to death before you eat them.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.782]  You know, halal slaughter is abusive.
[01:27:26.262 --> 01:27:31.885]  Even if that's not true, which I think it is a pretty torturous form of, it's not how I'd butcher an animal.
[01:27:33.644 --> 01:27:38.306]  I'd shoot them right between the eyes and with a tractor over a beam, haul them up by their legs and butcher them.
[01:27:38.326 --> 01:27:38.967]  That's how you do it.
[01:27:39.267 --> 01:27:39.827]  There's no pain.
[01:27:39.847 --> 01:27:40.547]  They never knew what hit them.
[01:27:41.608 --> 01:27:48.191]  A lot of guys, you know, shoot the cow and the way it's butchered in the barn, you know, with a .22, sometimes that doesn't get them right away.
[01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:50.452]  You shoot them and they have the .308, that gets them.
[01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:52.573]  Problem is the .308 bullet might go out of the barn.
[01:27:53.233 --> 01:27:53.774]  That's why you use a .22.
[01:27:53.874 --> 01:27:55.474]  A couple pop, pop, pop.
[01:27:55.695 --> 01:27:56.095]  It's done.
[01:27:56.395 --> 01:27:56.855]  Haul them up.
[01:27:57.395 --> 01:27:57.675]  Gut them.
[01:27:57.695 --> 01:28:00.017]  A couple, three, four guys can butcher it in an hour.
[01:28:00.537 --> 01:28:02.318]  It takes more time to cut it into steaks and things.
[01:28:03.373 --> 01:28:04.093]  That's not how they do it.
[01:28:04.153 --> 01:28:11.498]  I'm not going to go into graphics here, but again, whether it's right to say it's a torturing animal or not, you have a right to say that.
[01:28:12.218 --> 01:28:24.065]  And the left, that thinks you shouldn't be able to eat meat and all this stuff, and you know, that thinks your children should be taught how to put on dresses and give fellatio when they're, you know, six years old, all over the U.S.
[01:28:24.085 --> 01:28:26.606]  and all over Europe, the Islamicists, in fact, we ought to find those videos.
[01:28:26.626 --> 01:28:27.427]  I haven't played those in a while.
[01:28:28.748 --> 01:28:30.449]  Type in, like, Islamicists blow up on
[01:28:32.202 --> 01:28:33.083]  Gay Pride Parade.
[01:28:33.483 --> 01:28:34.343]  Or Blow Up at Leftist.
[01:28:34.804 --> 01:28:37.105]  And man, they come in and start attacking the Gay Pride Parade.
[01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.626]  And the Gay Pride Parade's like, what do you mean?
[01:28:39.166 --> 01:28:40.067]  You're anti-Western.
[01:28:40.087 --> 01:28:40.847]  You're anti-America.
[01:28:40.887 --> 01:28:41.728]  You're anti-Christian.
[01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:42.949]  You're our savior.
[01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:45.870]  And they're like, no, we're coming for you.
[01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:47.311]  We're gonna throw your ass off a building.
[01:28:48.192 --> 01:28:54.536]  Which just shows the left is a bunch of mad dog programmed enemies of the West because they're trying to conquer it.
[01:28:55.877 --> 01:28:57.438]  They're not for everybody's rights and stuff.
[01:28:57.458 --> 01:29:00.920]  They're authoritarians using our openness to press the attack.
[01:29:04.352 --> 01:29:08.094]  We have a new product line in that I'm extremely excited about.
[01:29:08.214 --> 01:29:15.116]  Everybody knows that Super Silver is the strongest over-the-counter, FDA approved for over-the-counter sale.
[01:29:15.876 --> 01:29:16.736]  Silver there is.
[01:29:16.756 --> 01:29:18.457]  It's used in medical clinics.
[01:29:18.517 --> 01:29:19.417]  It's used in hospitals.
[01:29:20.097 --> 01:29:20.778]  It's for wounds.
[01:29:20.878 --> 01:29:23.699]  A little pea-sized amount of it is like a shield on your skin.
[01:29:24.179 --> 01:29:24.759]  It's amazing.
[01:29:24.999 --> 01:29:25.799]  Everybody needs it.
[01:29:25.959 --> 01:29:27.920]  Once you've been wounded, once you've got a scratch or a
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:28.300]  I think?
[01:29:46.971 --> 01:29:47.111]  True.
[01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:48.131]  Well, that's what we got them to do.
[01:29:48.191 --> 01:29:48.971]  The same big company.
[01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.192]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:29:50.252 --> 01:29:50.912]  I've been so busy.
[01:29:51.012 --> 01:29:53.512]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[01:29:53.612 --> 01:29:55.673]  But it's very exciting from the same company.
[01:29:55.753 --> 01:29:56.453]  But it's new.
[01:29:56.573 --> 01:29:58.233]  Working with another big skin care company.
[01:29:58.393 --> 01:29:59.733]  They're producing it in their factory.
[01:29:59.893 --> 01:30:02.114]  It's super silver skin cream.
[01:30:02.254 --> 01:30:04.314]  And so, it's got all of these benefits.
[01:30:04.374 --> 01:30:05.414]  Too many to mention.
[01:30:05.454 --> 01:30:06.554]  But it's revolutionary.
[01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:07.555]  It's brand new.
[01:30:07.675 --> 01:30:08.435]  People are going to love it.
[01:30:08.515 --> 01:30:10.555]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.
[01:30:10.675 --> 01:30:12.015]  Exclusively at Inforrestore.com.
[01:30:12.035 --> 01:30:13.436]  25% off introductory price.
[01:30:13.576 --> 01:30:15.176]  Inforrest Live is very excited about this.
[01:30:15.316 --> 01:30:17.977]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:20.098]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[01:30:20.258 --> 01:30:22.779]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[01:30:22.879 --> 01:30:26.640]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:31.682]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[01:30:31.802 --> 01:30:42.807]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[01:30:42.867 --> 01:30:43.507]  Independent studies
[01:30:43.627 --> 01:30:48.330]  I'm sure the silver salt technology in super silver skin cream is 20 p.m.
[01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:54.314]  silver is used to 10 times more effective than amateur and similar products containing up to 3000 p.m.
[01:30:54.454 --> 01:30:54.754]  silver.
[01:30:54.834 --> 01:30:55.394]  And it goes on.
[01:30:55.494 --> 01:30:56.535]  This stuff is the real deal.
[01:30:56.555 --> 01:31:00.717]  Get super silver skin cream exclusively and for store dot com while supplies last.
[01:31:00.817 --> 01:31:03.399]  It's got the highly sought after hyaluronic acid.
[01:31:03.559 --> 01:31:08.322]  So this is stuff that has a lot of known great compounds and it's got the silver in it.
[01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:10.863]  From one of the top, probably the top group out there.
[01:31:11.003 --> 01:31:14.925]  So you definitely want to get this for yourself for external use only.
[01:31:15.025 --> 01:31:17.086]  And we've got it in the straight no scent.
[01:31:17.106 --> 01:31:17.966]  It's not even really a scent.
[01:31:18.066 --> 01:31:18.546]  It's natural.
[01:31:18.646 --> 01:31:20.407]  And we've also got it with the grapefruit.
[01:31:20.427 --> 01:31:21.467]  It's also got all those added.
[01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:22.768]  We have little tubes of it.
[01:31:22.788 --> 01:31:23.708]  We have big tubes of it.
[01:31:23.928 --> 01:31:25.089]  And it's a great deal.
[01:31:25.169 --> 01:31:28.470]  Again, $7.45 for the little one.
[01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:33.312]  And if you get the big ones, you get an even better deal for the amount that you get, $14.95.
[01:31:33.352 --> 01:31:33.932]  And I can tell you,
[01:31:35.353 --> 01:31:37.674]  Similar brands sold at stores that don't have the silver.
[01:31:37.815 --> 01:31:39.055]  Retail for $25.
[01:31:39.115 --> 01:31:39.416]  Sell for $19.95.
[01:31:40.236 --> 01:31:41.737]  So this is even better at $14.95.
[01:31:42.377 --> 01:31:43.438]  That is a really good deal.
[01:31:43.558 --> 01:31:46.020]  So this is a whole new enchilada.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.661]  It's a whole new world.
[01:31:47.681 --> 01:31:52.224]  And I believe it's going to end up being a national bestseller, not just here.
[01:31:52.244 --> 01:31:55.486]  And I believe it's going to fund us into taking the country and the world back.
[01:31:55.526 --> 01:31:56.446]  So please, check it out.
[01:31:56.486 --> 01:31:58.468]  The new products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:58.488 --> 01:32:01.510]  25% off as an introductory at InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:03.174 --> 01:32:16.105]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:32:16.345 --> 01:32:18.888]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:32:19.268 --> 01:32:20.389]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:32:21.029 --> 01:32:24.673]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:32:25.313 --> 01:32:29.236]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:30.437]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:30.918 --> 01:32:32.459]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:32:32.799 --> 01:32:33.820]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:34.401 --> 01:32:41.767]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:32:42.007 --> 01:32:43.969]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:48.212]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWorks.com.
[01:32:48.513 --> 01:32:49.433]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:32:50.214 --> 01:32:54.018]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:32:54.338 --> 01:32:55.199]  We are the resistance.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.802]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:08.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.568 --> 01:33:18.509]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[01:33:18.529 --> 01:33:19.490]  I've hung out with that guy.
[01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:21.171]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[01:33:21.271 --> 01:33:23.052]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[01:33:23.132 --> 01:33:24.953]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:33:25.253 --> 01:33:26.794]  That is a f***ing fact.
[01:33:26.974 --> 01:33:29.395]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:33:29.595 --> 01:33:32.477]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[01:33:32.697 --> 01:33:35.598]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:35.918 --> 01:33:38.960]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:42.001]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.181 --> 01:33:47.263]  Alex Jones supported President Trump, but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[01:33:47.403 --> 01:33:52.365]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[01:33:52.545 --> 01:33:55.426]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just... Yeah.
[01:33:55.566 --> 01:33:57.667]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:33:57.907 --> 01:33:59.970]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:01.832]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:34:02.032 --> 01:34:05.837]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:08.100]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.084]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:34:11.404 --> 01:34:15.269]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:22.839]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[01:34:23.059 --> 01:34:24.241]  The government's poisoning the water?
[01:34:24.661 --> 01:34:25.262]  Absolutely.
[01:34:25.282 --> 01:34:34.214]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose it's poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[01:34:34.634 --> 01:34:37.035]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one!
[01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:39.135]  He's fighting back against my takeover!
[01:34:39.496 --> 01:34:41.396]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[01:34:41.616 --> 01:34:44.677]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[01:34:44.837 --> 01:34:47.598]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[01:34:47.758 --> 01:34:52.460]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.580]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.441]  Jones says there's a world government.
[01:34:56.521 --> 01:34:58.462]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[01:34:58.682 --> 01:34:58.982]  It is.
[01:34:59.002 --> 01:34:59.882]  On and on and on.
[01:35:00.442 --> 01:35:03.023]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[01:35:03.283 --> 01:35:09.128]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[01:35:10.289 --> 01:35:15.633]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Farooli, developed brain cancer.
[01:35:15.733 --> 01:35:19.036]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[01:35:19.476 --> 01:35:31.006]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[01:35:31.266 --> 01:35:46.798]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves.
[01:35:47.078 --> 01:35:47.599]  Cell phones!
[01:35:47.879 --> 01:35:50.520]  Operate as microwave transmitters and receivers.
[01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:51.201]  Transceivers.
[01:35:51.341 --> 01:35:52.381]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[01:35:52.421 --> 01:35:53.362]  It vibrates water.
[01:35:53.402 --> 01:35:54.523]  Vibrates molecules.
[01:35:54.683 --> 01:35:59.585]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[01:35:59.605 --> 01:36:00.646]  That's what causes the heat.
[01:36:00.746 --> 01:36:01.846]  The friction of the molecules.
[01:36:02.007 --> 01:36:04.728]  And burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[01:36:04.788 --> 01:36:05.428]  You heard me right.
[01:36:06.009 --> 01:36:08.230]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:14.512]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[01:36:15.052 --> 01:36:28.117]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:30.198]  What may have happened here?
[01:36:30.438 --> 01:36:33.339]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[01:36:34.079 --> 01:36:40.301]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[01:36:40.641 --> 01:36:49.844]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:53.165]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[01:36:53.285 --> 01:36:55.107]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[01:36:55.127 --> 01:36:56.468]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[01:36:56.668 --> 01:36:59.070]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:36:59.551 --> 01:37:00.191]  Years ago.
[01:37:00.211 --> 01:37:07.899]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[01:37:07.979 --> 01:37:10.181]  He was talking about this years ago.
[01:37:10.301 --> 01:37:11.902]  Now it is mainstream news.
[01:37:24.346 --> 01:37:45.678]  Well, Count Dankula is in studio with us, had a great time hanging out with him and Carl, also known as Sargon, and they were talking about a lot of stuff there at the Steakhouse with me in Austin, Texas, that they don't even want to say on air, even though it's extremely mild, because they'll be put in prison
[01:37:46.977 --> 01:37:48.499]  In the United Kingdom.
[01:37:48.559 --> 01:38:00.710]  And so, as we go to my guest, I'd like to have a camera shot right here so I can show TV viewers just a few of the latest headlines in the last week.
[01:38:01.531 --> 01:38:02.852]  Video from the UK.
[01:38:02.912 --> 01:38:08.077]  Scottish police arrest man for painting Islam is questionable on his house.
[01:38:08.217 --> 01:38:09.998]  Boy, talk about the Magna Carta and freedom.
[01:38:10.739 --> 01:38:12.441]  Student kicked out of UNI after
[01:38:13.393 --> 01:38:17.374]  Branding halal meat barbaric and inhumane in an essay.
[01:38:20.655 --> 01:38:21.415]  This is Breitbart.
[01:38:21.435 --> 01:38:26.817]  British police arrested at least 3,395 people for offensive online comments in one year.
[01:38:29.077 --> 01:38:29.858]  Foreign policy.
[01:38:29.898 --> 01:38:31.238]  That's the Washington Post.
[01:38:32.378 --> 01:38:35.099]  Europe's free speech apocalypse is already here.
[01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.239]  That was three years ago.
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:37.960]  Oh, but now the left supports it.
[01:38:38.962 --> 01:38:40.103]  Europe's free speech crackdown.
[01:38:40.643 --> 01:38:43.124]  Punish anti-Muslims, ignore terrorists.
[01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:45.166]  National review.
[01:38:46.406 --> 01:38:49.328]  But the right-wing supports, the right-wing establishment supports all this.
[01:38:49.388 --> 01:39:01.335]  It's the neocons running most of it, as I'm going to show you coming up next segment, inside the Atlantic Council with folks in the NSA and CIA that Trump hasn't gotten rid of that work for Obama.
[01:39:01.655 --> 01:39:04.237]  Obama and Hillary still run big tech.
[01:39:04.277 --> 01:39:04.957]  They take orders.
[01:39:04.977 --> 01:39:06.418]  I'm going to show you their quotes coming up.
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.721]  Crackdown on free speech rise across Europe.
[01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:15.082]  So that's just some of it right there.
[01:39:15.782 --> 01:39:18.263]  Count Dankula, it's great to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:39:18.963 --> 01:39:26.345]  You're going to ride shotgun the rest of the hour and 20 minutes with us or so, into the fourth hour with Gerald Cilente taking over.
[01:39:27.146 --> 01:39:28.626]  What do you want to cover while you're here?
[01:39:28.686 --> 01:39:31.847]  I mean, I have to tell you, it was frightening last night.
[01:39:33.683 --> 01:39:51.101]  Talking to you guys and what you were discussing and just the incredible Iron Curtain of Tyranny and how many people are in prison or have been sent to prison like yourself and how many are facing more prison and then Tommy Robinson talking to Julian Assange in jail and all these exclusives you've got.
[01:39:52.301 --> 01:40:00.088]  In regards to freedom of speech in the UK, what you said there, the over 3,000 people that have been arrested for things that they have posted online, that is a true statement.
[01:40:00.108 --> 01:40:02.009]  But the funny thing is, in Russia last year it was only 300.
[01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:07.854]  So we are, in fact, arresting more people than Russia for things that they have said online.
[01:40:08.555 --> 01:40:09.836]  Well, the truth is, I've looked up Russia.
[01:40:09.856 --> 01:40:13.979]  They only arrest you if you're like a foreign agent working for an open NGO for Soros.
[01:40:14.039 --> 01:40:20.024]  And when you work for Soros and you come in to go into a church and piss on the sacraments, they arrest you.
[01:40:20.762 --> 01:40:21.022]  Really?
[01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:22.643]  That's disorderly conduct.
[01:40:22.864 --> 01:40:23.104]  Yeah.
[01:40:23.564 --> 01:40:26.126]  Well, that's something, obviously, if you're going in and causing damage.
[01:40:26.446 --> 01:40:38.996]  And then they pose as if, oh look, Russia is a police state, when no, when Pussy Riot, that's the name of it, funded by the CIA, goes in and tries to piss, literally, in the church, physically urinate, then they get arrested.
[01:40:39.856 --> 01:40:40.997]  I didn't know anything about that.
[01:40:41.037 --> 01:40:43.839]  I've seen them getting beaten in the streets, the Pussy Riot.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:45.561]  I didn't know anything about pissing in the church.
[01:40:45.601 --> 01:40:46.441]  That's what they did, yeah.
[01:40:47.442 --> 01:40:48.123]  Right, I didn't know.
[01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:49.564]  Bunch of stuff in the church, yeah.
[01:40:55.292 --> 01:40:57.493]  That's something, I could understand why you would be arrested for that.
[01:40:58.113 --> 01:41:04.415]  Exactly, what I'm saying is, you just pointed out 300 people arrested for supposed speech in Russia, meanwhile 3,000 plus in the UK.
[01:41:04.915 --> 01:41:09.557]  Yeah, we've even got some of the instances as well are absolutely ridiculous, one of the most
[01:41:10.077 --> 01:41:12.157]  Well known ones is a girl called Chelsea Russell.
[01:41:12.197 --> 01:41:17.238]  She's a young girl, she's still a teenager and in her estate where she lives, a young boy got knocked down.
[01:41:17.258 --> 01:41:22.379]  He was killed in a car accident and a lot of people from the estate were posting tributes and things like that to him online.
[01:41:22.759 --> 01:41:32.541]  She posted lyrics from his favourite rap song onto her Instagram and because the rap lyrics contained the N word, she was arrested and charged for that and she was found guilty.
[01:41:32.581 --> 01:41:37.462]  She was given a fine and she was also given a curfew and had to wear a GPS ankle bracelet.
[01:41:38.422 --> 01:41:43.864]  So his favorite rap song has those words, the black guy saying it, but then when you post the lyrics you go to jail?
[01:41:44.224 --> 01:41:46.525]  Yeah, even though they play these songs on the radio.
[01:41:47.185 --> 01:41:51.407]  So this is the opposite of the UK and where supposed free speech got enshrined?
[01:41:51.866 --> 01:41:54.188]  Yeah, free speech in the UK is in deep trouble.
[01:41:54.388 --> 01:42:08.121]  We're getting lots of people, especially one of the main things as well that the police very often use is it's something called the Hate Crime Operational Guidance Handbook and you can look this up, you can look this up, it actually does say several times in the handbook itself that it all comes down to the
[01:42:08.681 --> 01:42:12.082]  Not the matter of fact, the black and white of what actually happened in the situation.
[01:42:12.142 --> 01:42:15.603]  It comes down to the perception of the people involved.
[01:42:15.663 --> 01:42:21.045]  So the perception of the victim, the perception of the police, or even the perception of a bystander.
[01:42:21.065 --> 01:42:29.308]  So if you're having an argument in the street with someone who might be a Muslim, Jewish, or any of these other, you know, protected classes, you might not even have to utter a slur.
[01:42:29.508 --> 01:42:32.569]  You've not said anything homophobic or racist or anything like that at all.
[01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:33.950]  You might have just yelled at them.
[01:42:33.970 --> 01:42:37.311]  So what's happening is godlike powers being given to protected classes
[01:42:37.811 --> 01:42:40.913]  To wave magic wands and if they feel offended, you go to jail no matter what you did.
[01:42:41.093 --> 01:42:43.095]  Yeah, because it comes down to their perception.
[01:42:43.455 --> 01:42:54.102]  Even though you didn't say any slurs or anything at all, see if they or a bystander... But see how we gave the left the power in Europe and now in the UK and now here to decide, oh, you can't say something hurtful.
[01:42:54.122 --> 01:42:56.124]  Well, now everything's hurtful and now there's no free speech.
[01:42:56.144 --> 01:42:58.585]  Now we have real tyrants ruling over us and our children.
[01:42:59.326 --> 01:43:02.048]  We've got a very interesting guest in studio, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:09.267]  This is history.
[01:43:10.251 --> 01:43:14.787]  We've got two Google engineers that have the courage to go public.
[01:43:15.714 --> 01:43:16.875]  The first one and the second one.
[01:43:16.995 --> 01:43:17.975]  Others have just leaked stuff.
[01:43:18.316 --> 01:43:26.361]  And they're there together, interfacing for the first time live on an alternative system that Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple didn't want to exist.
[01:43:26.521 --> 01:43:30.644]  They knew it would threaten them in the future if it was here to challenge their information dominance.
[01:43:30.844 --> 01:43:31.844]  And history's happening.
[01:43:31.864 --> 01:43:38.669]  That's why listeners and viewers buying products, going to the store, getting things you already need at InfoWareStore.com is the reason this is happening.
[01:43:39.269 --> 01:43:40.970]  You guys have the floor, both of you.
[01:43:41.010 --> 01:43:43.513]  Zach Voorhees on Twitter, Perpetual Maniac.
[01:43:43.553 --> 01:43:44.734]  Greg Coppola on Twitter for now.
[01:43:44.834 --> 01:43:47.416]  Hey, Coppola, Understorer, Gregory, what do you think's coming next?
[01:43:47.576 --> 01:43:48.577]  Why did you go public?
[01:43:48.677 --> 01:43:50.238]  Obviously, more whistleblowers are coming.
[01:43:50.298 --> 01:43:53.421]  This is an amazing watershed moment, so go ahead and take over.
[01:43:53.541 --> 01:44:02.348]  Yeah, so, it's about six years that I was asleep within the company, and then the last two years, it was fully awake, and that process started.
[01:44:02.948 --> 01:44:08.133]  And once it started, you know, I remember the last thing, thinking to myself, what else are they lying about?
[01:44:08.933 --> 01:44:09.553]  And that was it.
[01:44:09.653 --> 01:44:09.973]  Wow.
[01:44:10.033 --> 01:44:10.734]  You know, bam.
[01:44:10.954 --> 01:44:11.754]  It just came.
[01:44:11.954 --> 01:44:20.177]  And for two years, I was really, really, really suffering being inside of YouTube and Google and seeing the company transform like this.
[01:44:20.437 --> 01:44:23.718]  I felt really guilty about drawing a salary.
[01:44:24.038 --> 01:44:27.959]  And I tried to let people know that this was coming.
[01:44:28.969 --> 01:44:35.715]  And now that I've released all of the information, I realize I'm not part of that evil, evil system anymore.
[01:44:36.455 --> 01:44:43.041]  And it's very uplifting, and I feel that I can, you know, meet my maker at the very end.
[01:44:43.221 --> 01:44:46.624]  And when he says, you came across evil, what did you do?
[01:44:46.944 --> 01:44:54.751]  And I'll be able to, like, look him right in the eye and say, I sacrificed everything to let the American people know that the AI weapons were pointed directly at their mind.
[01:44:55.091 --> 01:45:02.694]  You know, I think when I was comfortably drawing my paycheck, I felt, you know, more comfortable, more certain.
[01:45:02.714 --> 01:45:07.536]  Now I feel there's definitely a lot of uncertainty, but I feel more alert.
[01:45:07.716 --> 01:45:13.779]  And obviously, you know, just the fact that I'm not anonymous kind of makes life a little more dangerous, which is kind of actually making me a little bit more awake.
[01:45:14.019 --> 01:45:17.981]  First of all, I'm really curious when they're going to admit that Zach's, uh, leaks have happened.
[01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:19.842]  I mean, like, I mean, I'm talking about the mainstream media here.
[01:45:19.982 --> 01:45:28.847]  You know, that could be an interesting thing, and just, like, what's going to happen when they have to say, you know, this actually happened weeks ago, uh, that Zach leaked all these things, and we just didn't tell you, and these...
[01:45:29.367 --> 01:45:32.550]  You know, they're alleging that there's a system of censorship and we didn't tell you about it for two weeks.
[01:45:32.731 --> 01:45:35.293]  I mean, is that gonna kind of get anyone thinking?
[01:45:35.333 --> 01:45:35.774]  I don't know.
[01:45:36.655 --> 01:45:40.118]  And secondly, I think, you know, I would just underline that with Zach Stump.
[01:45:40.198 --> 01:45:41.820]  I mean, I think you've really seen everything now.
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:43.641]  It's all, I don't even think we need another leak.
[01:45:43.681 --> 01:45:50.028]  I mean, I'm sure some people are looking for it and some people might leak other things that are interesting, but I actually don't even think that we need anything else.
[01:45:50.088 --> 01:45:53.111]  And I think it's really important for consumers to just say like,
[01:45:53.917 --> 01:45:54.818]  Uh, look, there's a bias.
[01:45:54.858 --> 01:45:55.358]  We can see it.
[01:45:55.398 --> 01:45:56.419]  Everything's set by hand.
[01:45:56.439 --> 01:45:57.740]  It's nothing to do with computers at all.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:45:59.081]  And... Well, that's it.
[01:45:59.121 --> 01:46:03.143]  You just said something... God, I love talking to you guys with 150 IQs, 160 IQs.
[01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:15.852]  Because, exactly, everybody's always the next dump, the next piece, the next... What do you need when you have them saying blacklist and they've lied to Congress and said there aren't specific names, my names and others' names?
[01:46:15.992 --> 01:46:17.733]  It's all right there.
[01:46:17.813 --> 01:46:18.654]  We have them.
[01:46:18.874 --> 01:46:22.096]  It's a pile of smoky guns as big as Mount Everest is what you're saying.
[01:46:22.216 --> 01:46:30.283]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the meme where there's like a dog in the building and everything's on fire and he's just, you know, saying, oh, yeah, everything's fine.
[01:46:30.363 --> 01:46:33.106]  You know, the American people have had a fire woken up in them.
[01:46:33.326 --> 01:46:38.150]  And I think that they're really going to, you know, have a conversation with the representative.
[01:46:38.631 --> 01:46:44.356]  And, you know, that representative is going to come back from recess and they're going to be energized.
[01:46:44.956 --> 01:46:48.438]  To, you know, start working through what the solutions are.
[01:46:48.458 --> 01:46:49.978]  This is history making.
[01:46:50.038 --> 01:46:56.781]  Two senior Google engineers at a whistleblown, the first two, publicly coming together live on InfoWars.
[01:46:56.941 --> 01:47:01.023]  If that isn't radioactive kryptonite to tyranny, I don't know what the hell is.
[01:47:06.346 --> 01:47:08.987]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.503 --> 01:47:29.547]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:47:30.168 --> 01:47:32.411]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:33.092 --> 01:47:35.255]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:35.976 --> 01:47:38.360]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:47:38.961 --> 01:47:41.424]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:52.642]  Count Dankula's here with us.
[01:47:53.383 --> 01:47:54.503]  YouTube Count Dankula.
[01:47:54.803 --> 01:47:56.044]  Reaches hundreds of millions of people.
[01:47:56.984 --> 01:48:02.366]  He got first, of course, arrested a few years ago for doing a joke video of Hitler Dog.
[01:48:02.986 --> 01:48:05.267]  Very similar to bits that John Cleese has done.
[01:48:05.467 --> 01:48:06.848]  Similar to bits that I had done.
[01:48:08.291 --> 01:48:11.593]  And, you know, clearly, this is the police state.
[01:48:11.693 --> 01:48:14.756]  Europe, in the last 20 years, starting in Germany, outlawed the Nazi Party.
[01:48:15.826 --> 01:48:18.308]  And then they outlawed anything nationalist or right-wing.
[01:48:18.548 --> 01:48:20.850]  Then they invaded the country with Islam.
[01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:23.052]  This is all part of a larger admitted UN plan.
[01:48:23.572 --> 01:48:30.858]  And so every time I have dinner with some great person like you who's been put in jail or attacked or demonetized, they're always explaining, hey, I'm not a Nazi.
[01:48:30.898 --> 01:48:31.839]  Hey, I'm not racist.
[01:48:31.879 --> 01:48:34.120]  Hey, it's just up to the eye of the beholder.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:43.828]  And then the Islam is running, you know, child kidnapping rings and you can't even cover the trials or even say it's happening or that they're racially, you know, targeting white people or you get arrested, even though they say they are.
[01:48:44.168 --> 01:48:52.872]  Because it's racially stoking flames, the police say, if you admit that they're being racial, but then they're allowed to operate and rape whoever they want and be racial and be hateful.
[01:48:53.432 --> 01:49:01.695]  You import a third world, very tribal population that was taken over by the Muslims in the last 500 years, that's invaded India, killed 140 million Hindus.
[01:49:02.536 --> 01:49:09.859]  You bring in a bunch of these guys, and they take over and drive everybody out of the neighborhoods around them, because Islam's been invading like a cancer for 1,400 years.
[01:49:11.735 --> 01:49:21.402]  And so I sit there, and we try to explain to the police, and we try to explain it's our free speech, and then you then got into how, when you said, fine, I'll go to jail.
[01:49:21.963 --> 01:49:22.924]  I'm not going to plead guilty.
[01:49:23.903 --> 01:49:26.204]  No judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:49:26.224 --> 01:49:28.745]  They just took the money out of your bank account.
[01:49:29.225 --> 01:49:30.245]  It's the social score.
[01:49:30.285 --> 01:49:31.566]  It's the global social score.
[01:49:32.146 --> 01:49:36.287]  And so, to see this happening, this is a premeditated plan.
[01:49:36.707 --> 01:49:41.749]  The low-level leftists love the power they have to say that you've done something wrong, so you get arrested.
[01:49:42.455 --> 01:49:48.860]  But up on top, the big megacorporations and others want to end Western freedom because it doesn't work with their authoritarianism.
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:49.700]  They love China.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.921]  China's authoritarian.
[01:49:50.981 --> 01:49:51.862]  China dehumanizes.
[01:49:52.422 --> 01:49:54.283]  China just says you're anti-communist and arrests you.
[01:49:54.744 --> 01:50:05.792]  So they're using our classical liberalism as our Achilles heel and we have to stop it and realize this is incredible tyranny and that the police and these courts are tyrants and are incredibly dangerous.
[01:50:05.812 --> 01:50:10.255]  So tell people about your story and you've got the floor to really get into what's happening in Europe.
[01:50:10.595 --> 01:50:13.797]  And how it's coming here and the progression of this cancer?
[01:50:14.577 --> 01:50:23.222]  The main problem is the people that want to secretly run everything and control everything are authoritarians and the biggest threat to authoritarians is freedom of speech.
[01:50:23.282 --> 01:50:32.568]  If people are able to speak freely and they're able to convince other people that obviously authoritarians are bad, they're showing people the bad things the authoritarians are doing, like see for example right now
[01:50:33.188 --> 01:50:37.709]  The situation in Hong Kong, you know, this is a soft invasion by China.
[01:50:37.809 --> 01:50:41.450]  Right now it's a soft invasion by China, but soon I've got a feeling it's going to become a hard one.
[01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:46.391]  The people in Hong Kong are doing what Antifa and America think they're doing.
[01:50:46.612 --> 01:50:51.973]  Like, the people in Hong Kong are actually truly resisting against a brutal authoritarian regime.
[01:50:52.113 --> 01:50:55.434]  They're waving American flags, they love democracy, they love freedom, they love liberty.
[01:50:55.794 --> 01:50:59.235]  And when you speak to the people on the ground there in Hong Kong, they'll tell you exactly that.
[01:50:59.915 --> 01:51:07.721]  But for some reason people are now trying to paint the Hong Kong protesters as far right because they've decided to use the Pepe symbol as a mark of their freedom.
[01:51:07.962 --> 01:51:19.051]  And it just goes to show you the way that these people think that people fighting for their freedom, for their liberty, and in Hong Kong's case, most likely their lives, they're being branded as fascists.
[01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:29.095]  I can't understand how these people have actually tried to make that connection, that people who love and want freedom are somehow Nazis, fascists, bigots and white supremacists.
[01:51:29.255 --> 01:51:31.116]  I can't understand it.
[01:51:31.156 --> 01:51:34.297]  I think it's just because these people truly have run out of arguments.
[01:51:34.317 --> 01:51:43.722]  Because most of the time whenever you come up against someone and the first thing they do is call you a Nazi or a bigot, racist etc, without evidence, without any sort of support, you've won the argument.
[01:51:44.082 --> 01:51:45.143]  You've already won the argument.
[01:51:45.183 --> 01:51:46.904]  This person has nothing on you.
[01:51:48.305 --> 01:51:50.369]  Like, you've already come out on top.
[01:51:50.389 --> 01:51:51.692]  This person is an authoritarian.
[01:51:51.933 --> 01:51:52.834]  They just won't admit it.
[01:51:52.895 --> 01:51:59.348]  They just want you to shut up and stop talking about freedom because the biggest threat to the type of government and control that they want is freedom.
[01:52:00.424 --> 01:52:01.725]  Describe what it's like.
[01:52:02.566 --> 01:52:04.828]  Describe the type of things people have been arrested for.
[01:52:04.888 --> 01:52:06.190]  And of course, it's always expanding.
[01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:13.297]  Earlier, folks just joined us, a person died, I think you said a car wreck, accident.
[01:52:14.038 --> 01:52:20.844]  And then his favorite rap song, his girlfriend or a friend put a quote online that had the N-word in it.
[01:52:21.878 --> 01:52:29.389]  And, you know, if a music group's putting something out, and that's what they believe, you should be able to say it and it not be seen as offensive.
[01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:31.752]  But regardless, you shouldn't be arrested for it.
[01:52:32.273 --> 01:52:33.415]  And that's where this is all going.
[01:52:33.826 --> 01:52:39.710]  Yeah, it's basically, we're now at the point where hurting people's feelings has become a crime.
[01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:42.392]  Hurting a person's feelings has actually become a crime.
[01:52:42.952 --> 01:52:45.894]  And there was another example as well, that was the Chelsea Russell case.
[01:52:45.954 --> 01:52:52.078]  Her case eventually got overturned on appeal, but it took a lot of time and a lot of public support for that to actually happen.
[01:52:52.098 --> 01:52:54.940]  Yeah, so they're still going to make you go through all the trouble and all of it?
[01:52:55.220 --> 01:53:00.705]  Yeah, they're basically wasting police time, wasting courts time, wasting taxpayers money on absolute nonsense cases like this.
[01:53:00.725 --> 01:53:06.570]  There was even another one which was quite recent was, you heard of the Grenfell Tower fire that happened in London?
[01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:08.412]  It was a huge tower block that went on fire.
[01:53:08.732 --> 01:53:10.373]  Hundreds of people died, it was very tragic.
[01:53:11.354 --> 01:53:17.619]  There was people who actually made an effigy of Grenfell and actually set it on fire in their back garden.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.481]  Very, very mean-spirited as far as jokes go.
[01:53:20.521 --> 01:53:29.003]  It's not something that I would do, but these people were actually arrested and investigated by the police for what they did, and they ended up going to court.
[01:53:29.023 --> 01:53:37.286]  The police were searching through their bins, searching through their entire house, you know, over just hurting people's feelings, which I thought was a hell of a reaction from the police.
[01:53:37.826 --> 01:53:42.868]  Well, it's not their right, and it's a power grab, and it's the stuff that nightmares are made of.
[01:53:45.283 --> 01:53:51.445]  But speaking of that, firefighters in Sweden and Germany and everywhere, remember three years ago, oh, no-go zones aren't real.
[01:53:51.865 --> 01:53:52.946]  That's a right-wing lie.
[01:53:53.766 --> 01:53:55.547]  But everybody's known that they're expanding.
[01:53:55.727 --> 01:53:57.147]  Our crews have run into it.
[01:53:57.227 --> 01:53:58.068]  You've run into it.
[01:53:58.568 --> 01:53:59.968]  And now the no-go zones are there.
[01:54:00.108 --> 01:54:01.169]  Firefighters are getting attacked.
[01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.949]  They're getting shot at.
[01:54:02.329 --> 01:54:03.169]  Molotov cocktails.
[01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:10.272]  That's part of the reason the firefighters and police can't get into areas when there's a fire, and predominantly Muslim buildings burn down, is because there are no-go zones.
[01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:21.471]  I think it's just because of this rejection of... I think they see that obviously any type of authority, even if it's like the firefighters or the police or anything like that, they are seen as a representation of the state of the West.
[01:54:21.911 --> 01:54:22.452]  And they hate it.
[01:54:22.852 --> 01:54:23.372]  They don't want it.
[01:54:23.392 --> 01:54:24.453]  They want to have their own community.
[01:54:24.533 --> 01:54:34.603]  And isn't it funny, the police then kiss their ash, but then the very docile UK people on average that are very subservient to government on average, you're very polite, they are overrun and bossed around.
[01:54:35.063 --> 01:54:35.984]  Yeah.
[01:54:36.024 --> 01:54:43.167]  Like the guy that saved dozens of people, the Lion of... Oh, the London Bridge.
[01:54:43.207 --> 01:54:44.207]  The Lion of London Bridge.
[01:54:44.988 --> 01:54:50.390]  And they stabbed him over and over again because he told the media they were Muslims screaming Allah Akbar.
[01:54:51.091 --> 01:54:53.312]  And he saved a bunch of people, got stabbed dozens of times.
[01:54:53.672 --> 01:54:57.994]  He was put in a re-education camp just so he wouldn't hate Muslims after that.
[01:54:58.334 --> 01:55:02.016]  He was put on a, I think it was a right-wing terror watch list that he was put on.
[01:55:02.056 --> 01:55:03.636]  And he had to go to re-education?
[01:55:03.656 --> 01:55:05.097]  Yeah, the man's a national hero.
[01:55:05.577 --> 01:55:15.321]  The man's a national hero and he stopped, he saved people's lives, he got stabbed up a bunch himself, he made a huge sacrifice to protect the lives of others, to protect the lives of... The Lion of London Bridge, and there's too many of these.
[01:55:15.341 --> 01:55:23.665]  I mean, Tommy Robinson right now, we'll talk about it next hour, but I mean he's in a high-security prison, I say it's one of the worst in the UK, with Julian Assange.
[01:55:23.985 --> 01:55:36.990]  Yeah, from what I have heard from people who have gone to visit Tommy, Tommy's downstairs and in the cell above him is Julian Assange and they've been talking to each other by shouting through the windows of their cells.
[01:55:37.511 --> 01:55:40.932]  So I'm interested to see what type of conversations they've been having.
[01:55:42.346 --> 01:55:42.926]  You're just like me.
[01:55:42.966 --> 01:55:43.887]  I said we'll cover it next hour.
[01:55:43.907 --> 01:55:44.427]  You get right to it.
[01:55:44.447 --> 01:55:45.588]  But I like putting it all up front.
[01:55:45.628 --> 01:55:46.849]  Here's the thing.
[01:55:46.929 --> 01:55:48.510]  I could get up here all day and talk about this.
[01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:50.351]  You're a really funny comedian.
[01:55:51.211 --> 01:55:52.412]  I went back and looked at your work.
[01:55:53.512 --> 01:55:55.413]  And I would call it libertarian.
[01:55:55.454 --> 01:55:56.614]  I would call it kind of edgy.
[01:55:56.654 --> 01:55:57.915]  I'd call it kind of classical liberal.
[01:55:58.215 --> 01:56:01.957]  But even if you were a Nazi, you have a right to make a Hitler dog video.
[01:56:03.598 --> 01:56:06.560]  But briefly, tell people what happened to you.
[01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:22.795]  Oh, my girlfriend was always constantly going on about our pet pug, Pudder, and constantly going on about how cute, adorable and lovely he was, even in some instances picking the dog up and shoving him in my face, going, look how cute he is, which was kind of annoying when you're trying to watch TV.
[01:56:23.415 --> 01:56:31.838]  And I ended up getting so annoyed by it that I decided to turn the pug into the worst thing that I could think of, which was a Nazi.
[01:56:32.638 --> 01:56:32.858]  I don't
[01:56:49.825 --> 01:56:50.306]  We're good to go.
[01:57:16.488 --> 01:57:22.967]  I refused to pay it, and because I refused to pay it, instead of the police coming to get me, they just seized the money from my account without telling me.
[01:57:24.190 --> 01:57:24.850]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:29.792]  And Paul Watson did a great report on this where he shows John Cleese and others piling Hitler and doing all this.
[01:57:29.812 --> 01:57:31.053]  And obviously he's not supporting Hitler.
[01:57:31.313 --> 01:57:33.974]  But even if John Cleese did support Hitler, it's his right to do it.
[01:57:34.354 --> 01:57:35.494]  It's your right to boycott it.
[01:57:35.594 --> 01:57:39.256]  And that's why John Cleese has left the UK, he says, to the Caribbean.
[01:57:39.296 --> 01:57:40.816]  He says it's no longer a free country.
[01:57:41.257 --> 01:57:43.357]  And he's moved to an island that's 90% black.
[01:57:43.718 --> 01:57:45.518]  He says he's really happy to be with the black folks.
[01:57:45.898 --> 01:57:48.039]  He doesn't want to be around all the authoritarians in the UK.
[01:57:48.439 --> 01:57:49.700]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:52.113 --> 01:57:53.214]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:57:54.634 --> 01:57:55.795]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:57:55.835 --> 01:57:56.515]  I've been so busy.
[01:57:56.615 --> 01:58:00.297]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[01:58:00.437 --> 01:58:02.698]  It's super silver skin cream.
[01:58:02.778 --> 01:58:06.460]  It's got all of these benefits too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.501]  It's brand new.
[01:58:07.581 --> 01:58:08.341]  People are going to love it.

[01:58:53.607 --> 01:59:04.375]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:59:04.835 --> 01:59:08.478]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:59:08.978 --> 01:59:18.345]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:59:19.065 --> 01:59:20.586]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:23.289]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[01:59:23.769 --> 01:59:26.852]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[01:59:27.412 --> 01:59:33.797]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[01:59:34.318 --> 01:59:39.702]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[01:59:54.973 --> 02:00:00.897]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.067 --> 02:00:31.117]  You've been deplatformed some, but I've been watching Sargon of Akkad for years, but I always butcher how you say it.
[02:00:31.137 --> 02:00:35.259]  But meeting him in person, he's a larger-than-life character, and so are you.
[02:00:35.339 --> 02:00:36.460]  Thanks very much.
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:38.521]  Too bad he had to get back to Florida.
[02:00:38.581 --> 02:00:39.522]  The families are visiting.
[02:00:39.822 --> 02:00:41.643]  He kind of ran off for the day to come see us.
[02:00:41.943 --> 02:00:46.566]  Yeah, he snuck away from his family to come and hang out and unfortunately had to go back.
[02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:52.410]  It's crazy how he used to work at the big think tanks and for the government doing big demographic studies and stuff.
[02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:56.673]  He's a smart guy and he's a liberal and he thinks that the leftists are the number one threat.
[02:00:57.401 --> 02:01:12.647]  Well that's the thing, it's not the entirety of the left, it is the far left, but the problem is you're getting the sensible people on the left who are the true liberals who are fine with other people having opinions, they want to have discussions, debates, they want to do things sensibly, but they're getting attacked by their own far lefties.
[02:01:12.687 --> 02:01:22.831]  This is the thing, we'll get de-platformed from universities all the time, but you'll get actual left-wingers who are true liberals who are actually getting de-platformed as well because they aren't far left enough.
[02:01:23.391 --> 02:01:25.633]  Basically, you're not a communist, so you're not allowed free speech.
[02:01:25.853 --> 02:01:32.440]  Just standard typical authoritarian stuff, just like you've seen with Stalin, Pol Pot, you know, all that type of stuff.
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:45.992]  And it's getting more and more radical now, like a black hole, because everyone's trying to out, you know, stage the other person to where now I've seen videos in San Francisco all over, where the black students now will come up, just beat up white students,
[02:01:47.273 --> 02:01:51.236]  Or they're listening to rap music, or they have dreadlocks, saying you're not allowed to culturally appropriate.
[02:01:51.477 --> 02:01:53.638]  And the schools are like, well, they probably need to be beaten.
[02:01:53.658 --> 02:02:01.084]  You know, it's like the so-called tranny, you know, a guy in a dress in Australia attacking people with axes for no reason.
[02:02:01.504 --> 02:02:04.046]  And the judge said, you only get six years because you're a victim.
[02:02:04.386 --> 02:02:07.729]  Well, now the higher court came and said, no, you're getting 40-something years.
[02:02:08.029 --> 02:02:09.130]  I didn't know that.
[02:02:09.150 --> 02:02:10.011]  I knew the person got charged.
[02:02:10.071 --> 02:02:11.972]  I never knew they only get six.
[02:02:12.132 --> 02:02:14.634]  Well, the court said, you're a victim, so you need to go.
[02:02:14.674 --> 02:02:15.495]  You know, you were upset.
[02:02:16.508 --> 02:02:19.290]  Uh, because some girl online turned you down and you're a victim.
[02:02:19.570 --> 02:02:23.973]  So because you're a higher class person, other people will get, you know, life in prison for an axe attack.
[02:02:24.053 --> 02:02:24.954]  You only get six years.
[02:02:25.514 --> 02:02:30.538]  I thought countries were supposed to operate on the ethos of everyone is equal under the law.
[02:02:30.618 --> 02:02:34.100]  They want everyone to want to sterilize themselves to get some free goodies.
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:35.201]  It's about the population.
[02:02:35.741 --> 02:02:36.061]  Really?
[02:02:36.081 --> 02:02:36.682]  Oh yeah.
[02:02:38.442 --> 02:02:39.243]  Jesus Christ.
[02:02:39.824 --> 02:02:43.888]  I think I have noticed that as well that a lot of people now aren't very family focused.
[02:02:44.048 --> 02:02:45.250]  Nobody is child focused.
[02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:48.493]  Nobody wants to actually like get married, have children and settle down.
[02:02:48.914 --> 02:02:49.734]  I have noticed that.
[02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:56.041]  Like I got a bunch of people that were giving me, giving me a little bit of cheek because I'm married now and I plan on having kids.
[02:02:56.762 --> 02:02:58.204]  People give you problems.
[02:02:58.584 --> 02:03:01.105]  But oh, if people from India have 10 kids, it's great.
[02:03:01.145 --> 02:03:02.226]  Bring them in and give them all welfare.
[02:03:02.266 --> 02:03:05.768]  People from, you know, from Pakistan or people from wherever, that's great.
[02:03:06.108 --> 02:03:18.734]  But if, oh, if a European's having children, you know, back, my ex-wife, I had three children with her, and I saw this once, but she would tell me at Whole Foods, people would come up and say rude things to her because we had three good-looking kids.
[02:03:19.615 --> 02:03:20.055]  Well, why?
[02:03:20.075 --> 02:03:22.136]  Because you're not, it's hurting the earth, man.
[02:03:22.456 --> 02:03:24.737]  You heard Prince Harry and his wife say they're only having two kids.
[02:03:24.977 --> 02:03:25.218]  Yeah.
[02:03:26.536 --> 02:03:27.841]  So what type of problems do you get?
[02:03:27.861 --> 02:03:30.530]  Because you're married now, that's not...
[02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.991]  It was just the type of thing.
[02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:34.813]  Even when I was mentioning it to a few people, I'm getting married and it's like, really?
[02:03:34.853 --> 02:03:35.293]  You're doing that?
[02:03:35.313 --> 02:03:35.933]  You're settling down?
[02:03:35.973 --> 02:03:37.634]  I was like, yeah, well, I'm 30 now.
[02:03:37.935 --> 02:03:38.795]  I kind of want to.
[02:03:38.815 --> 02:03:42.077]  You know, your 20s are for having fun and messing around.
[02:03:42.137 --> 02:03:43.238]  My 20s are over now.
[02:03:43.298 --> 02:03:44.239]  It's time to be a man.
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.681]  That's my 10-year window for drinking and partying.
[02:03:48.021 --> 02:03:48.622]  It's over now.
[02:03:48.682 --> 02:03:50.163]  I'm going to settle down and have kids now.
[02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:54.085]  See, I did that 12 to 18, but yeah.
[02:03:54.706 --> 02:03:55.466]  I did that too, yeah.
[02:03:55.486 --> 02:03:56.287]  That was really bad.
[02:03:56.567 --> 02:03:56.807]  Anyway.
[02:03:58.448 --> 02:03:59.949]  I'm not knocking you out yet, but that's good.
[02:03:59.969 --> 02:04:00.349]  That's good.
[02:04:00.389 --> 02:04:00.949]  Have some kids.
[02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:01.810]  Yeah.
[02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:03.391]  How many do you want to have?
[02:04:03.471 --> 02:04:03.731]  Three.
[02:04:04.231 --> 02:04:04.451]  Good.
[02:04:04.571 --> 02:04:05.312]  Yeah, I want to have three.
[02:04:06.032 --> 02:04:06.252]  Yeah.
[02:04:06.452 --> 02:04:07.073]  Well, get going.
[02:04:08.333 --> 02:04:11.055]  That's what we're in the process of doing just now.
[02:04:11.075 --> 02:04:14.136]  You know, by being out here, you're actually kind of holding me back, you know.
[02:04:14.496 --> 02:04:17.058]  Could be out saving the earth right now, but you know, you have to come out.
[02:04:17.078 --> 02:04:18.719]  Well, you've got to save the earth and more humans.
[02:04:18.739 --> 02:04:20.519]  There's going to be more carbon dioxide.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:22.641]  That helps the plants grow faster.
[02:04:22.701 --> 02:04:23.321]  They don't want that.
[02:04:23.772 --> 02:04:29.297]  Yeah, that's the one thing that I don't understand as well, is everyone is knocking the climate change stuff.
[02:04:29.337 --> 02:04:36.683]  Now I do agree that pollution absolutely is a huge problem, but the reason that the first world is so developed is because we had an industrial revolution.
[02:04:37.424 --> 02:04:42.688]  We had an industrial revolution, we had factories, we had production, we had jobs, we had this huge economic boom.
[02:04:43.949 --> 02:04:47.971]  Third world countries aren't going to be able to achieve that if we don't do it.
[02:04:47.991 --> 02:04:51.952]  Let's talk about, and PragerU has the best breakdown of this, about demographics.
[02:04:52.112 --> 02:04:53.573]  Let's talk about that and get the number out.
[02:04:53.593 --> 02:04:55.593]  We'll come back with Count Dankula.
[02:04:55.613 --> 02:04:56.814]  He's a dank gentleman.
[02:04:57.214 --> 02:04:59.115]  He's a lot of fun to hang out with.
[02:04:59.135 --> 02:05:04.057]  Stay with us.
[02:05:04.917 --> 02:05:09.759]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[02:05:11.078 --> 02:05:19.661]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:05:20.481 --> 02:05:31.424]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:05:32.105 --> 02:05:36.306]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:05:37.226 --> 02:05:40.408]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[02:05:41.268 --> 02:05:46.350]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:05:48.151 --> 02:05:50.272]  Order now at the InfoWars store.

[02:06:22.159 --> 02:06:26.061]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:26.222 --> 02:06:36.168]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:36.968 --> 02:06:38.289]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:42.792]  We have Count Dankula here in studio with us.
[02:06:43.632 --> 02:06:45.494]  And again, describe yourself, your history.
[02:06:45.514 --> 02:06:45.914]  You've reached
[02:06:46.867 --> 02:06:48.408]  I mean, I'd say billions of people probably.
[02:06:48.428 --> 02:06:51.110]  I mean, I've had over 5 billion views on YouTube until they banned me.
[02:06:51.130 --> 02:06:52.330]  Just the ones on our own channels.
[02:06:52.810 --> 02:06:53.531]  A lot more than that.
[02:06:53.571 --> 02:07:02.456]  There's people like PewDiePie that, you know, people over 25 probably don't know who PewDiePie is, but he's got over 100 billion views on YouTube alone.
[02:07:02.756 --> 02:07:05.217]  There's nothing even close to that in the world.
[02:07:05.958 --> 02:07:09.600]  But you never hear about it because the corporate media wants to ignore what it doesn't control.
[02:07:10.725 --> 02:07:19.571]  This is the thing is, they come after PewDiePie all the time because the media don't like the fact that someone operating from their bedroom can gather just as much power as them.
[02:07:20.011 --> 02:07:24.935]  And I think it's with younger people, a lot of people are looking at the media, they're getting bored, they're catching the media lying all the time.
[02:07:25.782 --> 02:07:40.004]  A lot of young people find the mainstream media actually quite cringy and embarrassing to be a part of, and they don't want anything to do with it, so they turn to the YouTubers, they turn to the internet to get their news and get their information, which is why people like PewDiePie are so popular.
[02:07:40.525 --> 02:07:43.085]  Which is why the Wall Street Journal tried to burn PewDiePie down.
[02:07:43.445 --> 02:07:52.527]  They came after him because he made a few edgy jokes and everything, but it was, in the same instance we meet, 100% clear that these were intended as jokes, they were intended as comedy.
[02:07:52.887 --> 02:07:55.087]  They weren't racist, he's not a Nazi, he's not a white supremacist.
[02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:56.168]  Here's the problem.
[02:07:56.909 --> 02:08:04.700]  Every time somebody gets censored, Joe Rogan or people that are really smart go, but that wasn't racist what the professor said or that wasn't racist when the community said that.
[02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:06.446]  Since when?
[02:08:06.766 --> 02:08:10.969]  If you don't like somebody, don't go watch their comedy show, or don't watch their show, or boycott it if you want.
[02:08:11.269 --> 02:08:14.671]  But it doesn't mean you get arrested, and that's the laws they're trying to pass here.
[02:08:14.992 --> 02:08:20.756]  They have said in the news, Georgetown University's suing me over made-up stuff Charlottesville never said.
[02:08:21.336 --> 02:08:22.257]  The whole Sandy Hook thing.
[02:08:22.297 --> 02:08:24.798]  They say they want to kill the First Amendment.
[02:08:25.159 --> 02:08:30.763]  They want to set a precedent that if somebody says their feelings are hurt, you get sued, you lose, or you get arrested.
[02:08:31.443 --> 02:08:36.664]  This is what they say when the left walks by me in public, they go, aren't you supposed to be in prison by now?
[02:08:39.145 --> 02:08:44.466]  Well that's the thing, it's an example of just the peak narcissism of them.
[02:08:44.506 --> 02:08:50.568]  Like say for example, if I'm at a comedy club, I'm there with a hundred other people, the comedian's telling jokes I don't like, I'll just walk out and leave.
[02:08:50.748 --> 02:08:52.428]  I'll just say this isn't for me, bye.
[02:08:52.988 --> 02:08:55.409]  But these people will be the ones to stand up
[02:08:56.189 --> 02:09:04.915]  Demand that the show gets shut down, demand that this comedian be fired, and then demand that this person's life be ruined, because they don't think that they should alter themselves to fit into the world.
[02:09:04.935 --> 02:09:07.397]  They think that the whole world should change to suit them.
[02:09:07.797 --> 02:09:09.218]  It's absolute narcissism.
[02:09:09.238 --> 02:09:11.560]  If there is someone that you don't like, just don't watch it.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:19.845]  And the argument that they usually make against that is, oh, but if this person gets to speak and gets to say all these racist and edgy jokes, then other people might become racist.
[02:09:20.686 --> 02:09:36.222]  From what I've gathered in my discussions with actual genuine Nazis and actual genuine white supremacists, because the only way you're going to be able to understand them is to actually speak to them, is the main reason that they have become the way that they are is because of their demonisation by the media and also the treatment by the left.
[02:09:36.843 --> 02:09:42.006]  They're basically being formed as a counter to the far left's authoritarianism.
[02:09:42.086 --> 02:09:52.792]  They are the biggest cause for the rise in the far right because young people are being radicalised into it because of the way that they are being treated by authoritarian left-wing militant groups.
[02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:54.353]  Primarily Antifa.
[02:09:57.918 --> 02:10:05.881]  And of course Antifa is this protected group worldwide, funded by the big banks, by the big foundations, calling for communism, but financed by billionaires.
[02:10:06.321 --> 02:10:09.602]  They're authoritarians that have resorted to violence because they've lost the argument.
[02:10:10.642 --> 02:10:12.963]  They won't meet in debate because they know that they'll lose.
[02:10:13.943 --> 02:10:32.734]  Basically, if you go into a debate hall and you are advocating for taking away a person's right to speak, a person's right to produce any type of art or media that they would wish to produce, and just overall advocating for taking away the freedoms and individual liberties of people just so that you can force in your demonstrably bad, poor and ill-thought-out
[02:10:33.314 --> 02:10:34.875]  Political ideology, Ben.
[02:10:36.236 --> 02:10:41.379]  They've lost the argument that all this is the equivalent of a child having a tantrum.
[02:10:42.319 --> 02:10:47.803]  Antifa are a child having a tantrum because they've been told, no you can't get what you want because it is a bad idea.
[02:10:48.863 --> 02:10:53.266]  Venezuela, look at North Korea, look at Soviet Russia, look at China right now.
[02:10:53.387 --> 02:10:57.069]  You're even getting people in Antifa that are trying to be apologetic for China.
[02:10:57.089 --> 02:11:00.032]  They're trying to make excuses for China invading Hong Kong.
[02:11:00.472 --> 02:11:06.556]  What were some of the things that they were going, oh well Hong Kong technically did belong to China in the first place.
[02:11:07.197 --> 02:11:10.580]  Oh yeah, just last week there was sprayed
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:20.225]  All over Austin, China is good, and communism is coming, and hammers and sickles, and Antifa rise up, overthrow America.
[02:11:20.925 --> 02:11:27.749]  And so, one of my crew members that's been here 15, 16 years, longer, I see 17,
[02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:34.843]  His sister barely talks to him, won't talk to his mom, won't let her see the grandkids because she voted for Trump.
[02:11:35.184 --> 02:11:39.465]  And she had a great relationship with her mom and she said, I just hope China can take out Trump.
[02:11:39.766 --> 02:11:45.228]  So the average Democrat now, it's been in the Washington Post, New York Times, is now seeing China as the savior.
[02:11:45.288 --> 02:11:50.550]  I was telling people this two and a half years ago when the dictator Xi went to Davos and there was headlines in Reuters.
[02:11:53.786 --> 02:11:58.528]  G20 and Davos looks to China to stop Trump and America.
[02:11:59.208 --> 02:12:10.272]  And it's just crazy that the instincts of America to hate their own country is to support a mass murdering regime who is unelected, took over China, killed 150 million people.
[02:12:10.592 --> 02:12:17.195]  The people that ran to Hong Kong and Taiwan have been there for 70 years and now China builds a huge bridge to Hong Kong.
[02:12:17.975 --> 02:12:21.219]  Takes over the government, announces they're gonna start secretly arresting everybody.
[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:26.106]  The people start tearing down light poles that have face-canning cameras and battling back.
[02:12:26.687 --> 02:12:28.649]  And the left is like, get those people!
[02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:30.291]  How dare they wave American flags!
[02:12:30.572 --> 02:12:32.855]  And they're also trying to brand them as fascists and far-right.
[02:12:33.075 --> 02:12:42.025]  It's the fact is, that's the point that they've arrived at now, where if you want freedom, individual liberty, small government, you are somehow a far-right fascist.
[02:12:42.065 --> 02:12:45.989]  Wanting a small government is the opposite of fascism.
[02:12:46.029 --> 02:12:53.698]  People in the far left, you used to get the classic liberals that were just like, you know, peace and love, everyone can do what they want, as long as you're not messing with me, I'm not going to mess with you.
[02:12:54.819 --> 02:12:55.720]  I don't know.
[02:13:09.656 --> 02:13:13.778]  They're entitled, they're naive, and on average they come from middle class or upper class families.
[02:13:13.818 --> 02:13:18.019]  And they've been told by the professors, you're going to rule when we overthrow and take over.
[02:13:18.419 --> 02:13:24.362]  You're going to go right to being a commander in a black uniform, you know, literally in camps beating Christians' brains out.
[02:13:24.382 --> 02:13:26.783]  I think I've got an article here, we'll cover it when we come back.
[02:13:27.642 --> 02:13:31.464]  This professor was just removed here in the U.S.
[02:13:31.725 --> 02:13:33.486]  because he said, I want to kill Christians.
[02:13:33.606 --> 02:13:34.746]  I want to go out and attack.
[02:13:35.047 --> 02:13:35.947]  I want to kill Trump.
[02:13:35.987 --> 02:13:37.148]  I want to overthrow America.
[02:13:37.448 --> 02:13:52.698]  So at least there's pushback now that no, Antifa, just because you're a protected meth-head government employee or professor movement or journalists, so-called journalists that put on black masks at night, just because you're supposed to rule, you ain't going to do it because we're going to intellectually beat you.
[02:13:52.938 --> 02:13:54.239]  We're going to economically beat you.
[02:13:54.279 --> 02:13:55.259]  We're going to culturally beat you.
[02:13:56.977 --> 02:14:00.341]  Your Chi-Coms are now in a pincer grip, and we're going to free China.
[02:14:00.361 --> 02:14:02.203]  So get ready for that, you little slime bags.
[02:14:02.263 --> 02:14:04.566]  You will never get all the power you think you're going to get.
[02:14:04.866 --> 02:14:09.171]  Even if your controller's got control, you're the first group that they'll wipe off their shoes.
[02:14:09.512 --> 02:14:11.274]  That's how history works, dumbasses.
[02:14:11.554 --> 02:14:12.375]  Not talking to the audience.
[02:14:12.615 --> 02:14:15.338]  Talking to the Antifa that works for Alexander Demon Soros.
[02:14:15.939 --> 02:14:17.861]  We're going to come back and start taking your phone calls at 877-789-2539.
[02:14:17.901 --> 02:14:19.742]  We're talking about free speech.
[02:14:19.942 --> 02:14:21.663]  We're talking about the world.
[02:14:21.844 --> 02:14:22.804]  We're talking about Hong Kong.
[02:14:23.045 --> 02:14:24.065]  We're talking about the trade war.
[02:14:24.085 --> 02:14:31.511]  We're talking about the media siding against Trump and America with China and cheerleading the collapse of our economy.
[02:14:31.531 --> 02:14:31.771]  877-789-2539.
[02:14:31.791 --> 02:14:35.774]  877-789-ALEX is the number to join us, ladies and gentlemen, and to give us your take.
[02:14:35.814 --> 02:14:36.775]  It's wide open phones.
[02:14:36.975 --> 02:14:37.716]  First-time callers.
[02:14:37.756 --> 02:14:38.476]  Long-time callers.
[02:14:38.717 --> 02:14:39.737]  If you disagree,
[02:14:40.578 --> 02:14:46.500]  If you get in, some days I just open the phones up and say, if you disagree, I love to hear from Libtards.
[02:14:46.781 --> 02:14:50.142]  There's nothing better to hear you not even able to put a sentence together.
[02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:56.224]  So 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:57.005 --> 02:15:03.007]  And we will take your calls on the other side with, he's at Count Dankula on YouTube, Count Dankula in studio.
[02:15:03.247 --> 02:15:05.348]  Where else can people find Planet Dankula?
[02:15:06.371 --> 02:15:08.032]  You'll most likely find me on Twitter.
[02:15:08.773 --> 02:15:14.116]  I usually use that as a fine example to display to everyone just how crazy the far lefties have become.
[02:15:14.496 --> 02:15:15.577]  And you'll find me on YouTube.
[02:15:15.937 --> 02:15:17.958]  Alright, you have done well Lord Vader.
[02:15:18.258 --> 02:15:24.282]  We haven't played a lot of your really funny pieces and your history pieces you do and all of it, but it's all very educational.
[02:15:24.682 --> 02:15:27.503]  And old folks are watching it, young folks are watching it, kids are watching it.
[02:15:27.804 --> 02:15:29.665]  As we go to break, something to really upset the globalists.
[02:15:30.518 --> 02:15:34.820]  My oldest daughter goes to football games and goes all over and, you know, sees other schools and stuff.
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:42.723]  And in the stands or at school, and she goes to a big school, people will be sitting there and they'll be playing Alex Jones memes at lunch all over.
[02:15:43.163 --> 02:15:46.385]  And she walks in the hall and hears my voice and at football games, it's everywhere.
[02:15:46.725 --> 02:15:52.367]  And I'm nothing like a Pootie Pie or probably even a Count Danko when it comes to the young people watching.
[02:15:52.727 --> 02:15:55.028]  And it's beautiful and it really, really upsets them.
[02:15:55.268 --> 02:15:56.429]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:15:57.837 --> 02:16:00.299]  So the globalists better watch their evil assets.
[02:16:00.319 --> 02:16:02.821]  We'll be back.
[02:16:04.662 --> 02:16:08.305]  Donald Trump presents Real Stable Genius.
[02:16:09.306 --> 02:16:12.248]  Real Stable Genius!
[02:16:12.568 --> 02:16:16.451]  Today, we salute you, Mrs. Social Justice Warrior.
[02:16:16.571 --> 02:16:18.853]  Mrs. Social Justice Warrior!
[02:16:19.381 --> 02:16:22.043]  What do you do with a master's degree in gender studies?
[02:16:22.504 --> 02:16:25.966]  Put on a vagina hat and go fight fascism on the internet.
[02:16:27.267 --> 02:16:30.110]  As soon as you wake up each day, the outrage begins.
[02:16:30.530 --> 02:16:31.691]  What the f*** did you just say?
[02:16:31.971 --> 02:16:43.701]  Your privilege is showing and armed with only a keyboard, you tirelessly protect America from fake racism and fake sexism and fake, some other word we've never even heard of, ism.
[02:16:46.135 --> 02:16:50.378]  So, crack open a nice soy latte, Miss Purple Haired Vagina Costume Wearer.
[02:16:50.658 --> 02:16:52.619]  You live by life's two greatest rules.
[02:16:52.919 --> 02:16:56.501]  Punch Nazis, and everyone I don't like is a Nazi.
[02:16:56.541 --> 02:16:57.542]  Mr. Social Justice Warrior!
[02:16:57.582 --> 02:17:02.165]  Donald Trump, President Forever, Washington D.C.
[02:17:11.044 --> 02:17:14.767]  Super Silver is the strongest over-the-counter, FDA approved for over-the-counter sale.
[02:17:15.508 --> 02:17:16.368]  Silver there is.
[02:17:16.388 --> 02:17:18.090]  It's used in medical clinics.
[02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:19.050]  It's used in hospitals.
[02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:20.391]  It's for wounds.
[02:17:20.491 --> 02:17:23.334]  A little pea-sized amount of it is like a shield on your skin.
[02:17:23.814 --> 02:17:24.414]  It's amazing.
[02:17:24.635 --> 02:17:25.435]  Everybody needs it.
[02:17:25.615 --> 02:17:27.557]  Once you've been wounded, once you've got a scratch or a
[02:17:27.637 --> 02:17:27.777]  I think?
[02:17:46.596 --> 02:17:46.736]  True.
[02:17:46.756 --> 02:17:47.777]  Well, that's what we got them to do.
[02:17:47.817 --> 02:17:48.597]  The same big company.
[02:17:48.678 --> 02:17:49.838]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[02:17:49.878 --> 02:17:50.559]  I've been so busy.
[02:17:50.659 --> 02:17:53.141]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[02:17:53.241 --> 02:17:55.302]  But it's very exciting from the same company.
[02:17:55.403 --> 02:17:56.083]  But it's new.
[02:17:56.223 --> 02:17:57.884]  Working with another big skin care company.
[02:17:58.044 --> 02:17:59.385]  They're producing it in their factory.
[02:17:59.526 --> 02:18:01.787]  It's super silver skin cream.
[02:18:01.907 --> 02:18:03.969]  And so it's got all of these benefits.
[02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:05.050]  Too many to mention.
[02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.191]  But it's revolutionary.
[02:18:06.371 --> 02:18:07.211]  It's brand new.
[02:18:07.311 --> 02:18:08.092]  People are going to love it.
[02:18:08.172 --> 02:18:10.193]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.
[02:18:10.334 --> 02:18:11.254]  Exclusively at 4store.com.
[02:18:11.274 --> 02:18:12.235]  25% off introductory price.
[02:18:14.957 --> 02:18:17.599]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[02:18:17.619 --> 02:18:19.741]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[02:18:19.901 --> 02:18:22.443]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[02:18:22.523 --> 02:18:26.286]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[02:18:26.406 --> 02:18:31.330]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[02:18:31.450 --> 02:18:42.419]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[02:18:42.759 --> 02:18:43.039]  We're good.
[02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:03.019]  It's got the highly sought after hyaluronic acid.
[02:19:03.179 --> 02:19:10.501]  So this is stuff that has a lot of known great compounds and it's got the silver in it from one of the top, probably the top group out there.
[02:19:10.641 --> 02:19:14.563]  So you definitely want to get this for yourself for external use only.
[02:19:14.683 --> 02:19:16.823]  And we've got it in the straight, no scent.
[02:19:16.843 --> 02:19:17.604]  It's not really a scent.
[02:19:17.624 --> 02:19:18.204]  It's natural.
[02:19:18.304 --> 02:19:20.005]  And we've also got it with the grapefruit.
[02:19:20.025 --> 02:19:21.305]  It's also got all those added ingredients.
[02:19:21.365 --> 02:19:24.707]  We have little tubes of it, we have big tubes of it, and it's a great deal.
[02:19:24.808 --> 02:19:32.953]  Again, $7.45 for the little one, and if you get the big ones, you get an even better deal for the amount that you get $14.95.
[02:19:33.414 --> 02:19:39.078]  And I can tell you, similar brands sold at stores that don't have the silver, retail for $25, sell for $19.95.
[02:19:39.878 --> 02:19:40.939]  So this is even better at $14.95.
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:43.081]  That is a really good deal.
[02:19:43.201 --> 02:19:45.702]  So this is a whole new enchilada.
[02:19:46.123 --> 02:19:47.284]  It's a whole new world.
[02:19:48.204 --> 02:19:51.847]  Uh, and I believe it's going to end up being a national bestseller, not just here.
[02:19:51.867 --> 02:19:55.170]  And I believe it's going to fund us into taking the country and the world back.
[02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:56.111]  So please check it out.
[02:19:56.131 --> 02:19:58.093]  The new products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:58.113 --> 02:20:01.516]  25% off as an introductory at InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:09.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:33.415 --> 02:20:41.898]  Count Dankula, political prisoner previously, a successful YouTuber, comedian, satirist.
[02:20:42.938 --> 02:20:51.821]  All these are criminal terms now as it spread from Europe to the UK to Australia to New Zealand and now here they're openly saying arrest people for their speech.
[02:20:51.881 --> 02:20:57.083]  I've got all these different Democrats introducing legislation
[02:20:59.198 --> 02:21:02.141]  Saying if someone creates discord, they should be arrested.
[02:21:02.862 --> 02:21:07.366]  That's Mazie Inouye or whatever her name is from Hawaii.
[02:21:08.307 --> 02:21:13.392]  And then we've also got the Congresswoman from Florida that we played the clips of over and over again.
[02:21:14.012 --> 02:21:17.576]  Saying if somebody makes fun of us, we're going to indict you.
[02:21:18.917 --> 02:21:19.398]  They mean it.
[02:21:20.579 --> 02:21:21.760]  This is what they're talking about.
[02:21:22.961 --> 02:21:23.802]  This is what they're doing.
[02:21:25.503 --> 02:21:29.726]  But if you're committing real crimes in these leftist-controlled blue cities, they're not coming.
[02:21:29.786 --> 02:21:30.427]  Now, why is that?
[02:21:30.467 --> 02:21:34.270]  The Austin mayor was on KLBJ about a month ago.
[02:21:35.131 --> 02:21:37.833]  And I happened to be taking that day off to fish with my kids.
[02:21:38.833 --> 02:21:40.775]  And they were getting ready with the fishing poles out at the lake.
[02:21:41.355 --> 02:21:44.458]  And I put on 590 AM local talk station.
[02:21:44.478 --> 02:21:51.023]  And there was the mayor saying, oh, we've passed an ordinance that the homeless can camp on anywhere, your front yard.
[02:21:51.503 --> 02:21:54.666]  So you know that there's a problem, so the city will vote for more money.
[02:21:56.237 --> 02:21:56.837]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:21:56.877 --> 02:22:09.721]  They say, come here, use drugs, be homeless, and then the problem increases because it's a lifestyle catering to people who are given money to buy drugs and alcohol, and the left gives them money on top of it to defecate all over the streets.
[02:22:09.761 --> 02:22:12.442]  And now Austin looks like San Francisco ten years ago.
[02:22:12.762 --> 02:22:13.302]  It's horrible.
[02:22:13.803 --> 02:22:15.263]  But San Francisco is collapsing.
[02:22:15.323 --> 02:22:16.303]  No tourism, no anything.
[02:22:16.683 --> 02:22:17.604]  Same thing with Portland.
[02:22:18.364 --> 02:22:20.945]  Washington has big problems up in Seattle.
[02:22:22.345 --> 02:22:23.446]  Baltimore, D.C.
[02:22:23.526 --> 02:22:24.266]  The list goes on and on.
[02:22:25.333 --> 02:22:29.416]  It's the same reason they want to federalize the police and cause crises, to bring in control.
[02:22:30.036 --> 02:22:39.343]  Same reason, when the left gets full control, they want to collapse our major cities and declare a national emergency to fully federalize them.
[02:22:39.683 --> 02:22:46.789]  They want to do it under Trump, but they want to do it once the Democrats get back in.
[02:22:47.489 --> 02:22:53.093]  So report, Baltimore police afraid to arrest anyone out of fear of political backlash.
[02:22:53.113 --> 02:22:54.214]  There's a video of it.
[02:22:55.336 --> 02:22:59.961]  And that's why you see in Baltimore a whole bunch of cops getting shot two weeks ago.
[02:23:00.882 --> 02:23:09.171]  And when they're going in with the ambulances, when they got shot, the people are hitting them, screaming at them, throwing water bottles at them, and calling them the N-word.
[02:23:10.352 --> 02:23:12.114]  Other blacks are calling black officers that.
[02:23:12.634 --> 02:23:13.675]  Because they're the enemy.
[02:23:14.376 --> 02:23:16.699]  And so they're saying, okay, we can't come into your areas then.
[02:23:17.867 --> 02:23:20.610]  And then the crime rate explodes like South Side Chicago.
[02:23:21.431 --> 02:23:23.152]  So these are no-go zones we're talking about.
[02:23:23.493 --> 02:23:26.776]  The left's creating them on purpose, bringing in the Islamics, knowing they'll do it.
[02:23:26.836 --> 02:23:28.558]  Here's another one, as I mentioned in the last segment.
[02:23:29.018 --> 02:23:32.101]  Iowa College removes professor who declared, I'm Antifa.
[02:23:32.562 --> 02:23:39.669]  He also reportedly shared shockingly violent Facebook posts about how much he wanted to kill Christians, kill Trump, and kill others.
[02:23:41.104 --> 02:23:42.166]  Well, he's now been removed.
[02:23:42.186 --> 02:23:44.028]  We're in a campus reform report.
[02:23:44.569 --> 02:23:48.936]  Kleisman announced last week that he supported the movement which drew immediate backlash.
[02:23:48.956 --> 02:23:51.620]  He called for Antifa, again, to kill Christians and mourn.
[02:23:52.401 --> 02:23:55.743]  And he's now been removed from the college that he was at.
[02:23:55.783 --> 02:23:56.524]  I read this this morning.
[02:23:56.564 --> 02:23:59.125]  I'm looking for what college he was in here.
[02:24:00.066 --> 02:24:04.109]  It was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Kirkwood Community College.
[02:24:04.549 --> 02:24:06.030]  And so, I don't want to just mention things.
[02:24:06.050 --> 02:24:07.171]  I want to show you those.
[02:24:07.871 --> 02:24:09.752]  But at least there's some pushback against this.
[02:24:10.073 --> 02:24:16.617]  I see callers here asking, and we'll go to Wes in a moment, they want to ask you, Count Dankula, where does it all end?
[02:24:18.735 --> 02:24:31.962]  I think ultimately what's going to result in is we need political candidates to actually get up and take the effort to run for government and run for higher positions who are freedom loving people that actually do care about the countries that they are a part of.
[02:24:31.982 --> 02:24:36.404]  For example, you're getting politicians that are going in it now, they want the money, they want the fame, they want the power.
[02:24:37.104 --> 02:24:42.547]  Very, very few politicians actually go into politics with the intent of helping people.
[02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:45.909]  They use helping people as a facade to get the votes.
[02:24:46.329 --> 02:24:50.551]  For example, there are very few politicians that I actually respect and I actually would vote for.
[02:24:50.591 --> 02:24:51.152]  For example,
[02:24:51.852 --> 02:24:56.255]  I really like Trump because he's brought black unemployment all the way right down which is fantastic.
[02:24:56.295 --> 02:24:56.835]  That's excellent.
[02:24:56.855 --> 02:24:58.116]  I want everyone to have jobs.
[02:24:58.176 --> 02:25:03.080]  I want everyone to be able to afford the family home with the white picket fence and the dog and the 2.5 kids.
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:06.862]  I want that for absolutely everyone and Trump is helping people achieve that.
[02:25:06.942 --> 02:25:07.503]  But I also...
[02:25:08.283 --> 02:25:17.649]  I'm starting to like Tulsi Gabbard because she actually wants to come after big tech censorship as well and she spoke about this even before personally she was affected by it.
[02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:21.692]  And plus notice none of the Democrats like her and they're all rigging Google searches.
[02:25:21.972 --> 02:25:27.877]  Oh yeah, basically after the Democratic debate where she absolutely bodied Kamala Harris.
[02:25:27.917 --> 02:25:29.938]  She annihilated Kamala Harris.
[02:25:30.418 --> 02:25:32.380]  She was number three trending on Twitter.
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:34.581]  Twitter noticed and she was gone.
[02:25:34.761 --> 02:25:35.182]  And by the way...
[02:25:36.082 --> 02:25:37.623]  She could potentially beat Trump.
[02:25:37.743 --> 02:25:40.465]  Young, good-looking, a veteran, well-spoken, a real liberal.
[02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:42.626]  She has some things I don't like about her, but you're right.
[02:25:42.646 --> 02:25:44.968]  She's legitimate and comes off as a real person.
[02:25:45.268 --> 02:25:46.849]  And they are scared of her.
[02:25:47.109 --> 02:25:47.869]  And take Trump.
[02:25:48.270 --> 02:25:51.932]  If Trump can be the turnaround guy to save America, his name will be gold.
[02:25:52.072 --> 02:25:53.192]  If isn't, he'll be destroyed.
[02:25:53.453 --> 02:25:55.254]  That's why he's really trying to fix things.
[02:25:55.834 --> 02:25:56.735]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:25:57.296 --> 02:26:02.001]  Those are two examples of politicians I'm looking at and they actually genuinely seem to want to help people.
[02:26:02.442 --> 02:26:04.204]  There are a lot of others that don't care.
[02:26:04.264 --> 02:26:15.557]  What people at home should do is go out, get involved, join political parties, form your own political party and go into government with the sole intention of protecting the freedoms and rights of others because...
[02:26:16.058 --> 02:26:19.060]  That's all government's there, is to ensure that people's rights are there.
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:20.862]  They don't give you your rights, it's there to protect them.
[02:26:21.022 --> 02:26:27.166]  And when governments become destructive of those rights, it is not just our right, it is our duty to remove and abolish those governments.
[02:26:27.426 --> 02:26:28.547]  And that's the Declaration of Independence.
[02:26:28.747 --> 02:26:28.967]  Yes.
[02:26:29.888 --> 02:26:35.372]  You're so lucky that you guys have your Bill of Rights and your Constitution, because we don't have anything like that.
[02:26:35.472 --> 02:26:39.695]  Our rights are treated more like privileges that the state can take away from you at any point.
[02:26:39.935 --> 02:26:41.356]  Well, they've reversed Magna Carta.
[02:26:41.396 --> 02:26:41.777]  I remember in 1998,
[02:26:43.818 --> 02:26:46.142]  Uh, Tony Blair said, we're abolishing Magna Carta.
[02:26:46.482 --> 02:26:46.663]  Yeah.
[02:26:47.003 --> 02:26:48.105]  That was in the BBC headline.
[02:26:48.646 --> 02:26:49.887]  We're abolishing Magna Carta.
[02:26:49.927 --> 02:26:55.255]  So, you know, the beginning of people standing up really is 1215, Runnymede, you know, what's the UK today?
[02:26:55.335 --> 02:26:55.556]  England.
[02:26:56.157 --> 02:26:57.559]  But it's devolved back now.
[02:26:57.955 --> 02:27:01.518]  Yeah, it's basically... Authoritarians are just being authoritarians.
[02:27:01.558 --> 02:27:06.903]  They're trying to take away all the little freedoms and rights that we have, slowly but surely, so that they can have full control over us.
[02:27:06.943 --> 02:27:15.851]  Jordan B. Peterson, when he was on Joe Rogan, actually defined it a really, really good way, where the government will push a little tiny bit until people start to scream and then it'll stop.
[02:27:16.471 --> 02:27:28.778]  And then when everyone calms down it will push a little tiny bit again and then stop and it will just keep doing this process over and over and over again until you've just sleepwalked into all of your rights and privileges and liberty's just been completely taken away and that is what the government wants.
[02:27:28.818 --> 02:27:35.042]  It doesn't care about you, it cares about controlling you and it's going to do everything that it can to make sure that that happens.
[02:27:35.062 --> 02:27:40.665]  And that's because there's special interest coming in and using our once free governments to convert us to something like China.
[02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:41.446]  I mean, that's the goal.
[02:27:42.148 --> 02:27:42.848]  That is the goal.
[02:27:42.968 --> 02:27:48.710]  Like, even when you look at the freedom of speech laws that we have right now, everyone's saying, oh, it's to protect people, it's to protect their freedoms.
[02:27:48.951 --> 02:27:53.332]  See, if you look at the way China started, China didn't just become China overnight.
[02:27:53.612 --> 02:28:08.878]  There was a slow process in building all of these laws up until, like, you addressed it earlier, you know, it starts with, these laws are to protect the people, then these laws... Oh yeah, it took Mao about 10 years to really get rolling, and he used the colleges as the first place to say, basically, you know, we're gonna kill everybody.
[02:28:09.298 --> 02:28:12.520]  And then he used, the MAL brigades were like brown shirts to do it.
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:28.567]  Yeah, it starts with protecting people, then it moves on to protecting politicians, like you said earlier, but you know politicians are calling for, oh if people criticise us they should be arrested, they should be this, and we had an example of that actually happen in Britain, which I'll get into in a minute, but then ultimately after the politicians, what's next?
[02:28:28.707 --> 02:28:29.227]  The government.
[02:28:29.267 --> 02:28:39.152]  It's about criticism of the government itself, because if you can criticise the government and point out the sketchy things the government's doing, that'll turn the people against the government, and that puts the government's authority at risk.
[02:28:39.172 --> 02:28:41.893]  I see the UK government going, this could undermine the government.
[02:28:42.333 --> 02:28:42.574]  Goods?
[02:28:42.794 --> 02:28:44.154]  They're like, this could discredit us.
[02:28:44.194 --> 02:28:46.155]  Yeah, because you're able, you deserve to be discredited.
[02:28:46.695 --> 02:28:55.680]  We're gonna come back, I promise, to Wes and Ryan and Rod and Brian and Travis and Tim and Jackson and Joey and Doug and everybody straight ahead with Count Dankula.
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.041]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[02:28:59.201 --> 02:29:00.422]  Only you can share those links.
[02:29:00.642 --> 02:29:00.962]  Thank you.
[02:29:05.203 --> 02:29:07.124]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[02:29:07.144 --> 02:29:08.105]  I've hung out with that guy.
[02:29:08.125 --> 02:29:09.785]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[02:29:09.885 --> 02:29:11.666]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[02:29:11.746 --> 02:29:13.547]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[02:29:13.867 --> 02:29:15.408]  That is a f***ing fact.
[02:29:15.588 --> 02:29:18.009]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:29:18.209 --> 02:29:21.091]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[02:29:21.331 --> 02:29:24.213]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[02:29:24.533 --> 02:29:27.554]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[02:29:27.634 --> 02:29:30.616]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:30.796 --> 02:29:35.859]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[02:29:36.019 --> 02:29:40.982]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[02:29:41.162 --> 02:29:43.283]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just...
[02:29:43.803 --> 02:29:44.023]  Yeah.
[02:29:44.164 --> 02:29:46.326]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:46.526 --> 02:29:48.588]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.648 --> 02:29:50.450]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:54.454]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[02:29:54.535 --> 02:29:56.697]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:56.757 --> 02:29:59.700]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.904]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[02:30:04.699 --> 02:30:11.644]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[02:30:11.664 --> 02:30:12.865]  The government's poisoning the water?
[02:30:13.265 --> 02:30:13.886]  Absolutely.
[02:30:13.906 --> 02:30:22.732]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose to poison the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[02:30:23.252 --> 02:30:25.654]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one!
[02:30:25.874 --> 02:30:27.775]  He's fighting back against my takeover!
[02:30:28.115 --> 02:30:30.176]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[02:30:30.236 --> 02:30:33.298]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[02:30:33.458 --> 02:30:36.200]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:41.083]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[02:30:41.283 --> 02:30:43.204]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[02:30:43.424 --> 02:30:45.065]  Jones says there's a world government.
[02:30:45.145 --> 02:30:47.086]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[02:30:47.306 --> 02:30:47.607]  It is.
[02:30:47.627 --> 02:30:48.507]  On and on and on.
[02:30:49.067 --> 02:30:51.649]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[02:30:51.909 --> 02:30:57.752]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[02:30:58.892 --> 02:31:04.254]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Faruli, developed brain cancer.
[02:31:04.354 --> 02:31:07.636]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[02:31:08.076 --> 02:31:19.601]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[02:31:19.881 --> 02:31:36.217]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves, cell phones,
[02:31:36.497 --> 02:31:39.800]  ...operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:41.041]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[02:31:41.061 --> 02:31:43.102]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[02:31:43.282 --> 02:31:48.206]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[02:31:48.226 --> 02:31:53.350]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[02:31:53.410 --> 02:31:54.051]  You heard me right.
[02:31:54.611 --> 02:31:56.853]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[02:31:57.333 --> 02:32:03.138]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[02:32:03.658 --> 02:32:16.749]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[02:32:17.450 --> 02:32:18.811]  What may have happened here?
[02:32:19.051 --> 02:32:21.954]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[02:32:22.694 --> 02:32:28.919]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[02:32:29.259 --> 02:32:38.466]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[02:32:38.727 --> 02:32:41.789]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[02:32:41.889 --> 02:32:43.869]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[02:32:44.149 --> 02:32:45.090]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[02:32:45.290 --> 02:32:47.670]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:32:48.170 --> 02:32:48.830]  Years ago.
[02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:56.512]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[02:32:56.572 --> 02:32:58.772]  He was talking about this years ago.
[02:32:58.912 --> 02:33:00.552]  Now it is mainstream news.
[02:33:06.193 --> 02:33:08.874]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.552 --> 02:33:26.696]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:27.397 --> 02:33:28.958]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.399 --> 02:33:37.366]  We've really built something amazing here together.
[02:33:37.387 --> 02:33:43.492]  The listeners, the viewers of this show, all the supporters over the years, the great crew, and all the guests.
[02:33:44.573 --> 02:33:45.815]  And it stands in defiance
[02:33:47.247 --> 02:33:47.547]  I don't know.
[02:34:11.468 --> 02:34:12.309]  That keeps them going.
[02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:16.273]  And a lot of these organizations are on the verge of going bankrupt.
[02:34:16.893 --> 02:34:18.295]  I'm going to cover this tomorrow.
[02:34:19.690 --> 02:34:23.731]  Because it's in all the documents and I covered it two and a half years ago.
[02:34:24.451 --> 02:34:26.832]  But then even Rolling Stone and a few others actually covered it.
[02:34:27.612 --> 02:34:30.173]  And it was just shocking to see Matt Taibbi write about it.
[02:34:31.113 --> 02:34:34.374]  How Obama and Hillary still run part of the CIA.
[02:34:34.994 --> 02:34:36.695]  They funded these stay-behind groups.
[02:34:37.615 --> 02:34:44.157]  And that the Democrats in Congress are commanding them in congressional hearings to shut down conservatives.
[02:34:44.317 --> 02:34:48.798]  And these media groups were given two billion dollars.
[02:34:50.805 --> 02:34:51.465]  It's Taibbi.
[02:34:51.505 --> 02:34:53.026]  Censorship does not end well.
[02:34:53.707 --> 02:34:56.548]  Taibbi, beware the slippery slope of Facebook.
[02:34:57.769 --> 02:34:58.309]  Censorship.
[02:34:58.889 --> 02:35:05.593]  And the articles attack me, but they say, hey, he's how they got the left to accept the end of free speech.
[02:35:06.333 --> 02:35:11.096]  By demonizing Jones, by creating a straw man, and then getting people to accept my
[02:35:12.935 --> 02:35:16.137]  Supposed destruction, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[02:35:16.337 --> 02:35:22.119]  Then the whole door got blown off of the submarine and all the tyranny flooded in.
[02:35:22.179 --> 02:35:31.104]  So please don't forget, I guess the way that God works or however this happens, we keep bringing in just the amount of money we need to operate.
[02:35:32.104 --> 02:35:33.265]  And I want to expand.
[02:35:33.365 --> 02:35:35.686]  I want to launch some new shows, which we're doing next month.
[02:35:36.586 --> 02:35:39.728]  I want to be able to put reporters in the field, like we've done with
[02:35:41.028 --> 02:35:42.789]  Overall, four reporters in Hong Kong.
[02:35:43.469 --> 02:35:48.910]  I want to be able to do all these things and without you buying the products, we cannot do it.
[02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:50.951]  So just check out infowarestore.com.
[02:35:51.511 --> 02:35:56.833]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get a great air filter, get a great water filter you and your family need.
[02:35:57.533 --> 02:36:03.655]  Get the new nano silver skin cream that we've got from the same great folks that brought you
[02:36:04.718 --> 02:36:08.519]  The Super Silver Wound Gel that's patented and so incredibly popular.
[02:36:08.859 --> 02:36:09.920]  This is proprietary.
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:11.520]  We worked with them to develop this.
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:15.962]  This is a brand new thing that just came out last week.
[02:36:16.002 --> 02:36:17.762]  Folks are already getting it in their mail.
[02:36:18.182 --> 02:36:20.023]  They're already giving it five stars.
[02:36:20.503 --> 02:36:23.864]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to all the supplements and all the other products.
[02:36:25.484 --> 02:36:26.305]  Again, the Super
[02:36:27.304 --> 02:36:28.587]  Silver Wound Gel is a drug.
[02:36:28.627 --> 02:36:29.970]  It's FDA approved over-the-counter.
[02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:31.593]  The strongest available over-the-counter.
[02:36:32.154 --> 02:36:33.758]  This company let me private label that.
[02:36:34.178 --> 02:36:35.581]  I'm the only people that are allowed to do that.
[02:36:37.443 --> 02:36:50.316]  We then discounted the super silver cream is the same nano silver, but it's just not gone through all the approval to, you know, say approved for over-the-counter in the drug section.
[02:36:50.476 --> 02:36:51.577]  None of it means anything.
[02:36:52.078 --> 02:37:00.326]  Again, what the FDA does is they got a law passed in 96 trying to outlaw supplements and Congress said, and Ron Paul is critical fighting this, they said,
[02:37:01.152 --> 02:37:03.276]  No, we're not saying we're drugs.
[02:37:03.576 --> 02:37:04.638]  You have no jurisdiction.
[02:37:05.219 --> 02:37:09.926]  So the FDA said, OK, well, you have to say not approved by the FDA.
[02:37:10.447 --> 02:37:12.991]  So they're always like, Jones sells unapproved things.
[02:37:13.831 --> 02:37:25.574]  Well, that's because the FDA makes all the supplement companies sit there and say that it is not approved by them because, by law, they don't have that jurisdiction to be able to even do that.
[02:37:26.194 --> 02:37:29.415]  But then they try to come in and regulate people who are claiming that they're drugs.
[02:37:29.795 --> 02:37:32.516]  Well, we're not saying these are drugs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:32.916 --> 02:37:34.897]  We're not saying that krill oil's a drug.
[02:37:35.137 --> 02:37:37.057]  We're not saying that clean iodine's a drug.
[02:37:37.318 --> 02:37:39.098]  This is all from Mother Nature that God gave us.
[02:37:39.418 --> 02:37:42.159]  And whether it's turmeric, or whether it's our high-quality coffee,
[02:37:42.679 --> 02:37:44.260]  They even try to say my coffee's a scam.
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:45.640]  It sells coffee!
[02:37:46.701 --> 02:37:47.441]  And toothpaste!
[02:37:47.541 --> 02:37:48.322]  Damn bastard!
[02:37:48.642 --> 02:37:50.323]  A scam that you need toothpaste!
[02:37:50.563 --> 02:37:52.504]  He's a toothpaste snake oil salesman.
[02:37:53.044 --> 02:37:53.544]  Well, guess what?
[02:37:53.604 --> 02:37:54.565]  People love Super Blue.
[02:37:54.805 --> 02:37:57.666]  Fortified with a little silver and iodine, no fluoride is in it.
[02:37:57.726 --> 02:38:02.389]  So, again, we are very, very, very excited about all of this.
[02:38:03.288 --> 02:38:07.472]  We're energized by it, and this new product is really putting wind in our sails.
[02:38:07.832 --> 02:38:09.954]  The only problem is I put in a medium-sized order for it.
[02:38:09.974 --> 02:38:11.476]  It looks like it's going to sell out in the next couple weeks.
[02:38:11.876 --> 02:38:14.018]  So I've got it in the 25% off at the end of this week.
[02:38:14.358 --> 02:38:15.059]  Take advantage of it.
[02:38:15.099 --> 02:38:20.965]  We have it in the smaller containers, and we have it in the larger containers, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:21.465 --> 02:38:21.725]  Anything.
[02:38:21.745 --> 02:38:21.905]  I'm easy.
[02:38:21.946 --> 02:38:22.666]  You can do whatever you want.
[02:38:43.131 --> 02:38:44.692]  You wanted to get into Epstein when we talked today.
[02:38:44.852 --> 02:38:45.113]  Yes.
[02:38:45.213 --> 02:38:48.736]  So we'll also hit some of that after we take some of these calls.
[02:38:49.196 --> 02:38:50.897]  Let's go ahead and go to Wes in Indiana.
[02:38:50.937 --> 02:38:52.038]  Wes, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:38:53.099 --> 02:38:56.702]  Yeah, I just want to say quickly, I take your H2.
[02:38:56.782 --> 02:38:58.163]  I've taken it for two years.
[02:38:59.004 --> 02:39:03.107]  I went from 285 pounds to 225 pounds.
[02:39:03.788 --> 02:39:06.850]  I quit taking it and the weight started coming back on.
[02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:11.314]  I take it again and now it's back down to 225 and I've done nothing else.
[02:39:12.134 --> 02:39:12.815]  But anyway,
[02:39:13.334 --> 02:39:21.918]  I just wanted to say, and ask you, you said one time with Classic, I don't know where this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you got one.
[02:39:22.658 --> 02:39:29.021]  And considering everything's going on, I just wondered, and asked your guest, what?
[02:39:29.301 --> 02:39:30.282]  We're just going to end it.
[02:39:30.442 --> 02:39:32.823]  It has to end somewhere, you know?
[02:39:32.923 --> 02:39:34.404]  Eventually the fly's got to land.
[02:39:35.899 --> 02:39:36.780]  That's right.
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:43.484]  Look at how all the old-timers warned of a world government and leftists banning speech and killing babies after they're born.
[02:39:43.564 --> 02:39:44.804]  It's all going on.
[02:39:45.065 --> 02:39:46.325]  And then what comes next?
[02:39:46.385 --> 02:39:47.506]  I mean, we were right.
[02:39:47.566 --> 02:39:51.649]  We have real tyranny, not on our doorstep, but up our you-know-what.
[02:39:52.229 --> 02:39:53.790]  Yeah, we definitely do.
[02:39:54.090 --> 02:39:56.892]  It's going to come to a point where the government is just going to get replaced.
[02:39:57.652 --> 02:39:59.213]  It's just going to be completely replaced.
[02:39:59.233 --> 02:40:01.174]  People are very, very unhappy with the stuff they're doing.
[02:40:01.254 --> 02:40:02.195]  No, I agree with you.
[02:40:02.235 --> 02:40:03.576]  I think they're going to be removed.
[02:40:04.215 --> 02:40:06.076]  Yeah, I think they definitely are.
[02:40:06.096 --> 02:40:07.977]  Hopefully through a democratic process.
[02:40:08.797 --> 02:40:09.878]  That's what we're working for, brother!
[02:40:09.958 --> 02:40:10.998]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:40:11.018 --> 02:40:12.519]  It's definitely going to come.
[02:40:12.679 --> 02:40:17.221]  Basically, career politicians, they've just become absolute snakes and they don't care about people.
[02:40:17.261 --> 02:40:23.123]  And the more and more we can wake people up to that, eventually there's going to come a day where the generation below us are just going to vote all of them out.
[02:40:23.184 --> 02:40:28.586]  They're all gone and they're going to replace it with people that actually love freedom and actually care about the countries they're supposed to be helping.
[02:40:28.786 --> 02:40:29.186]  Well, you're right.
[02:40:29.226 --> 02:40:43.456]  And plus, there's a tipping point, historically, where you have a good virtuous culture, corruption isn't put up with, you have a huge expansion, a golden age, and then corruption sets in, takes over, sets up the system, and in a few generations, everything collapses again.
[02:40:43.836 --> 02:40:44.957]  It is a cycle.
[02:40:45.497 --> 02:40:51.622]  And so people that have given up faith that good doesn't exist or that things couldn't turn around know we're hitting the bottom now.
[02:40:51.962 --> 02:40:57.886]  And every real historian worked their salt from Camille Paglia to, you know, people like
[02:40:58.246 --> 02:41:01.907]  I mean, you name it, Pat Buchanan agrees that we're entering the bottom.
[02:41:03.188 --> 02:41:04.688]  I think I said, what was the name of the cycle?
[02:41:04.748 --> 02:41:12.110]  Is it good men create great times, great times create weak men, weak men create bad times, bad times create good men.
[02:41:12.310 --> 02:41:14.731]  Like that's, I think I've completely butchered that.
[02:41:14.751 --> 02:41:15.191]  No, you didn't.
[02:41:15.211 --> 02:41:16.011]  You said it perfectly.
[02:41:16.372 --> 02:41:24.294]  Victor Hugo, the French philosopher and statesman said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[02:41:24.761 --> 02:41:25.761]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:25.801 --> 02:41:34.685]  I think we're basically approaching the time now where we're going to create good and strong men because of the way things are going and I believe that these strong men are going to be the ones that change it.
[02:41:35.266 --> 02:41:36.306]  Again, starting with the government.
[02:41:36.326 --> 02:41:50.933]  I totally agree because I'm not, and God bless you Wes, thanks for the call, I'm not saying this to act tough or anything, there's a lot of people who can kick my ass, but I was a sweet little boy and really nice and into art and I liked fishing and hunting and stuff and riding horses, but I was really sweet.
[02:41:51.829 --> 02:42:03.664]  And then my parents took me out of private school in sixth grade and put me in a school in Dallas, and it was so politically correct that the white kids were all allowed to be beaten up by kids that were black and Hispanic and were three years older.
[02:42:04.365 --> 02:42:05.426]  And it was just what went on.
[02:42:05.466 --> 02:42:08.170]  Well, by the time I got in seventh grade, I was putting people in the hospital.
[02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:14.413]  And they could never do anything, because I'm like, hey, this kid's two years older than me, he attacked me, I jumped on top of him, slammed his head in the ground, I'm sorry, he's in a coma.
[02:42:14.653 --> 02:42:15.893]  They're like, what the hell, who is this kid?
[02:42:16.234 --> 02:42:24.377]  And by high school I had to fight all their brothers and cousins, and then by high school I had to fight, I mean, I had to fight their big brothers that were gotten out of Lewis Derrick for, you know, attempted murder.
[02:42:24.817 --> 02:42:27.118]  And so I was in some real fights.
[02:42:27.219 --> 02:42:27.939]  I mean, I'll leave it at that.
[02:42:28.479 --> 02:42:39.488]  And it unlocked in me this savageness and this crazed viciousness, not in a bad way, and just these things that unlock, these weapon systems that made me who I am.
[02:42:39.648 --> 02:42:40.789]  I would not be who I am.
[02:42:41.049 --> 02:42:42.511]  And that's why they want to keep you domesticated.
[02:42:42.531 --> 02:42:43.872]  I'm not saying go out and get in fights and stuff.
[02:42:44.152 --> 02:42:50.557]  That's why they don't want rites of passage or really hard competitive sports or boxing or jiu-jitsu or mountain climbing or any of that.
[02:42:50.777 --> 02:42:54.500]  Because if you go through pain and go through a lot, you come out a lot stronger.
[02:42:54.781 --> 02:42:56.202]  And I did, no exaggeration.
[02:42:56.502 --> 02:43:00.443]  I probably got in 150 really serious fights, and it made me who I am.
[02:43:00.463 --> 02:43:00.984]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:02.104 --> 02:43:04.385]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:43:04.425 --> 02:43:05.565]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[02:43:05.625 --> 02:43:10.087]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[02:43:10.227 --> 02:43:12.447]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[02:43:12.547 --> 02:43:16.249]  It's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.
[02:43:16.429 --> 02:43:17.269]  It's brand new.
[02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:18.129]  People are going to love it.
[02:43:18.209 --> 02:43:20.270]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[02:43:20.370 --> 02:43:21.690]  Exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:44:05.655 --> 02:44:15.222]  I traveled from California to Texas, and it's like a three-day drive, especially if you're not... I had a trailer behind me, so I can't go really fast.
[02:44:15.383 --> 02:44:19.285]  So I'm driving, and I love God's country, and it's beautiful.
[02:44:19.346 --> 02:44:21.107]  But being humans, we get tired.
[02:44:21.387 --> 02:44:25.690]  And even just after four hours of driving, and I'm just starting to get tired, and I remembered.
[02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:27.932]  I said, oh, I have a pack of TurboForce.
[02:44:28.052 --> 02:44:34.117]  So I reached into my console in my vehicle, and I took out the TurboForce, and I stopped at a gas station.
[02:44:35.243 --> 02:44:37.525]  And I got me some orange juice.
[02:44:37.545 --> 02:44:39.046]  It wasn't quite this big.
[02:44:39.467 --> 02:44:41.848]  The typical size is a little bit smaller.
[02:44:41.869 --> 02:44:49.214]  And I'll put like half the packet of the Turbo Force in it because the stuff is so great and so wonderful it gets you going.
[02:44:49.695 --> 02:44:50.896]  But there's quite a bit in this one.
[02:44:50.916 --> 02:44:53.138]  So I'm going to put the whole thing in this one.
[02:44:54.158 --> 02:45:02.085]  And when I was driving from California to Texas, I took the Turbo Force and I put it in orange juice.
[02:45:03.066 --> 02:45:04.347]  And I took it and I shook it up.
[02:45:10.629 --> 02:45:11.369]  Get in there real good.
[02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:13.731]  And you know what's amazing?
[02:45:13.811 --> 02:45:16.053]  It actually enheightens the taste.
[02:45:16.073 --> 02:45:17.754]  I mean, I really like it.
[02:45:17.794 --> 02:45:23.818]  I mean, I'm a big fan of orange juice already, but... Yeah.
[02:45:25.038 --> 02:45:27.140]  I mean, it's really good.
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:27.700]  Let me see.
[02:45:29.321 --> 02:45:29.621]  Mmm.
[02:45:31.183 --> 02:45:31.463]  Mmm.
[02:45:32.383 --> 02:45:32.804]  Wow.
[02:45:34.645 --> 02:45:37.147]  It's like energy immediately.
[02:45:37.347 --> 02:45:40.670]  The experience with Turboforce in orange juice is so different.
[02:45:40.690 --> 02:45:44.793]  A lot of people just take it and put it in water and they never thought about putting it in orange juice.
[02:45:44.913 --> 02:45:45.714]  It's completely different.
[02:45:45.854 --> 02:45:48.576]  So the orange juice, it like intensifies the taste.
[02:45:48.636 --> 02:45:49.137]  But you know what?
[02:45:49.277 --> 02:45:51.699]  I'm not talking about it just so people will buy it.
[02:45:51.799 --> 02:45:53.941]  I'm talking about it because it's my personal experience.
[02:45:54.061 --> 02:45:55.622]  It's like it brightens the orange juice up.
[02:45:55.722 --> 02:45:56.743]  I can't really explain it.
[02:45:56.783 --> 02:45:59.345]  You have to buy it and try it yourself to understand.
[02:45:59.465 --> 02:45:59.725]  We're good
[02:46:16.775 --> 02:46:17.315]  Pass out.
[02:46:17.455 --> 02:46:22.558]  And you know, I've had so many people come up to me and said, Will, I tried it with the orange juice and I love it.
[02:46:22.738 --> 02:46:25.960]  And with the TurboForce, I mean, it's like the missing ingredient.
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:29.422]  I mean, seriously, TurboForce is the missing ingredient in the orange juice.
[02:46:29.582 --> 02:46:31.303]  And I'm addicted to it.
[02:46:31.663 --> 02:46:34.865]  The TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:46:35.991 --> 02:46:37.993]  Most of the time, they keep it on sale.
[02:46:38.374 --> 02:46:40.997]  And I'm like, how are they able to do that?
[02:46:41.057 --> 02:46:42.899]  They keep it on sale for so long.
[02:46:43.039 --> 02:46:53.410]  And I think, now I've never been told this, but I think the main reason why they keep it on sale and they keep the price so low is that so people will try it and you will be amazed.
[02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:54.891]  So get the Turbo Force today.
[02:46:54.971 --> 02:46:56.053]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:47:06.249 --> 02:47:08.931]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.561 --> 02:47:27.484]  The great Gerald Cilente takes over at 15 after, but we're going to all the calls that are on hold.
[02:47:27.945 --> 02:47:30.767]  It's hard to interrupt this song right here.
[02:47:32.481 --> 02:47:34.324]  My eyes are blind but I can see.
[02:47:34.344 --> 02:47:37.650]  You were talking about how you've got all metal teeth because...
[02:47:38.553 --> 02:47:42.174]  Your profession before you became world famous on YouTube is a bouncer.
[02:47:42.534 --> 02:47:43.154]  Yeah.
[02:47:43.234 --> 02:47:49.216]  And do you think that made you a more wary, focused, smart guy before you became a media superstar?
[02:47:49.236 --> 02:48:02.360]  It makes you a lot more stoic, you know, because see when you've got some guy who's, you know, really, really drunk and full of cocaine, you know, shouting in your face because you're throwing him out or you're telling him he's not getting in and you just have to sit there with a straight face and not rise to him baiting you.
[02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:05.441]  But obviously, if he tries to attack you, you are right on top of him.
[02:48:05.521 --> 02:48:06.201]  He's on the ground.
[02:48:06.741 --> 02:48:08.703]  You know, in a second before he knows what's happened.
[02:48:08.883 --> 02:48:16.010]  I think it developed me a lot as a person because I'm very, if I've got someone shouting in my face, I'm very good at not reacting to it.
[02:48:16.994 --> 02:48:19.697]  Like the Covington kids, they're bad for standing their ground.
[02:48:19.957 --> 02:48:23.481]  Oh yeah, that kid literally did nothing but stood there and smiled.
[02:48:23.901 --> 02:48:28.886]  And then suddenly he became the face of white supremacy in America, even though he was just a child.
[02:48:29.186 --> 02:48:38.616]  He was just a child that had no idea what to do, so he just stood there, smiling awkwardly, and the media tried to destroy his life when he literally didn't do anything.
[02:48:40.745 --> 02:48:42.165]  Here's an example, and we're going to your calls.
[02:48:42.926 --> 02:48:48.067]  Forced removal of transgender woman from downtown LA bar, investigated as possible hate crime.
[02:48:48.427 --> 02:48:51.788]  Turns out it's basically a liberal bar, okay?
[02:48:51.948 --> 02:49:03.891]  They've never had the problem that the two groups were fighting, so they threw them all out, and they've gone and talked to witnesses, and no one said anything to them about being LGBTQP or whatever.
[02:49:04.591 --> 02:49:08.192]  Again, it's just like the sheriff's deputy in the same town said he got shot last week.
[02:49:09.309 --> 02:49:10.730]  And he wasn't shot, he just made it up.
[02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:12.411]  It's just making it up.
[02:49:12.911 --> 02:49:15.673]  I think it's the fact that they fall on it as an excuse.
[02:49:16.153 --> 02:49:22.216]  You know, for example, if someone goes, oh, I didn't get this job because I'm gay, I didn't get this job because of this, I didn't get this job because of that.
[02:49:22.236 --> 02:49:31.762]  And it's always, they always try and blame some identity politics part of themselves and try and say the bigotry and racism is the reason that I didn't get this and I didn't excel.
[02:49:32.142 --> 02:49:36.425]  But see, when you actually speak to these people, you kind of realize that they're very annoying, they're very arrogant, and they're
[02:49:37.205 --> 02:49:39.588]  Basically, that's the reason that you aren't getting these things.
[02:49:39.628 --> 02:49:43.273]  It's not to do with bigotry or racism, you're just using that to have something to blame.
[02:49:43.413 --> 02:49:47.699]  You're actually quite an annoying, arrogant person and people don't want to associate with you.
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:49.842]  Like, it's not bigotry or anything.
[02:49:49.862 --> 02:49:51.304]  Wait, have they released footage?
[02:49:51.805 --> 02:49:52.025]  What?
[02:49:52.385 --> 02:49:52.485]  Oh.
[02:49:53.587 --> 02:49:54.208]  Oh my god.
[02:49:56.553 --> 02:49:57.714]  I think footage may have been released.
[02:49:57.734 --> 02:49:58.315]  We're going to find out.
[02:49:58.335 --> 02:50:00.777]  This does not look like the lady's being too nice.
[02:50:01.217 --> 02:50:02.158]  How dare they throw her out?
[02:50:02.618 --> 02:50:02.879]  Yeah.
[02:50:03.439 --> 02:50:04.000]  Geez, man.
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:05.501]  I don't even like going to bars and stuff.
[02:50:05.541 --> 02:50:09.805]  Most bouncers are nice, but a few times, you know, they can be arrogant or whatever.
[02:50:09.845 --> 02:50:10.766]  Like, what are you looking at?
[02:50:10.966 --> 02:50:13.728]  I mean, these people should have been thrown out.
[02:50:13.749 --> 02:50:14.729]  We're going to review this.
[02:50:14.749 --> 02:50:16.631]  We're going to go to calls right now, but we'll come back to this.
[02:50:16.651 --> 02:50:18.353]  I've got to get to these calls whenever we get to everybody.
[02:50:18.673 --> 02:50:19.674]  Who do we have here next?
[02:50:19.694 --> 02:50:21.455]  I was going to go to a caller in France.
[02:50:22.355 --> 02:50:23.816]  Yes, Rob in France.
[02:50:23.856 --> 02:50:24.516]  Thanks for holding.
[02:50:25.296 --> 02:50:25.956]  You're on the air.
[02:50:25.976 --> 02:50:26.296]  Welcome.
[02:50:27.237 --> 02:50:28.097]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:28.357 --> 02:50:30.378]  It's always good to talk to you.
[02:50:31.338 --> 02:50:33.639]  I haven't got in for quite a long time.
[02:50:34.799 --> 02:50:36.140]  I want to tell you, you're one of the best.
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:39.881]  Your snake oil products are absolutely fantastic.
[02:50:40.541 --> 02:50:42.202]  I'm a huge fan of DNA Force.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:46.303]  I bought a Pro-Pure for myself and an Alexa Pure for my mom.
[02:50:46.323 --> 02:50:49.766]  I've got a couple of subjects I want to speak to you about.
[02:50:50.126 --> 02:50:50.406]  Thank you.
[02:50:50.426 --> 02:50:52.088]  First of all, I live in France.
[02:50:52.128 --> 02:50:55.611]  I've been here for about 20 years, but I'm originally from Dayton, Ohio.
[02:50:57.052 --> 02:51:06.680]  My daughter was actually at the Oregon District and was giving CPR to one of the victims there.
[02:51:08.922 --> 02:51:09.943]  I also follow Trump.
[02:51:10.934 --> 02:51:30.707]  I wrote in an SMS to him, on Twitter or whatever, that as bad as that shooting was, it's not as scary as what's going on in England right now, with the First Amendment being completely put aside.
[02:51:31.127 --> 02:51:32.968]  It's just awful, and it's terrifying.
[02:51:33.709 --> 02:51:37.751]  And with the immigration problem in Europe, it's very widespread.
[02:51:40.945 --> 02:51:41.945]  Kind of a scary thing.
[02:51:42.565 --> 02:51:45.326]  I kind of follow Joel Richardson on Joel's Trumpet.
[02:51:45.626 --> 02:51:58.348]  I have nothing to do with this site, but it talks a lot about, you know, a lot of people know who Tim LaHaye is, and, you know, a lot of Christian people, and they look at the resurgence of the Roman Empire as the coming Antichrist.
[02:51:58.948 --> 02:52:06.530]  Well, there's another way to look at that as well, with Joel Richardson, who, like I said, speaks about this and talks about the
[02:52:12.643 --> 02:52:13.543]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:52:13.623 --> 02:52:14.344]  I mean, here's the deal.
[02:52:14.844 --> 02:52:18.746]  I was against the first Iraq war, the second Iraq war, because it was wrong.
[02:52:18.766 --> 02:52:19.507]  It was based on lies.
[02:52:19.527 --> 02:52:26.070]  It was designed to bring down moderate regimes and put the radicals in, and that's what Obama phase two did, to then flood Europe.
[02:52:26.090 --> 02:52:30.313]  This is a UN-planned replacement population, and the Islamists do not
[02:52:31.273 --> 02:52:32.114]  I don't
[02:52:46.561 --> 02:52:52.323]  They've gotten rid of God and all the studies, but their God now is, quote, a quality, and it was like we were talking about at dinner last night.
[02:52:53.303 --> 02:53:00.146]  The temples, the cathedrals are the universities, the priests are the professors, and this is their new religion.
[02:53:00.186 --> 02:53:00.906]  This is their takeover.
[02:53:02.365 --> 02:53:02.965]  It's very true.
[02:53:03.565 --> 02:53:14.934]  For example, we were making the comparisons last night saying that if you are born white and male, you're immediately guilty and you owe reparations for slavery and colonialism and all the horrible things that white male just did in the past.
[02:53:14.954 --> 02:53:20.759]  So that's their version of original sin that you have to atone and apologise for.
[02:53:21.399 --> 02:53:31.307]  They have their Ten Commandments, pretty much, as well, where if you say absolutely anything about the Church of Social Justice, you're immediately excommunicated and shunned from the community.
[02:53:31.647 --> 02:53:32.628]  You can't question the priests.
[02:53:32.808 --> 02:53:34.110]  No, you're not allowed to question them.
[02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:36.432]  If you do, it means you're a racist, Nazi bigot.
[02:53:36.452 --> 02:53:37.954]  So the left needs a reformation.
[02:53:38.419 --> 02:53:39.439]  It does, it does.
[02:53:40.700 --> 02:54:07.210]  I wanted to just go to the classical way it was where there was some disagreements between the left and right but both of them for the most part did not trust big government, did not trust big corporations and did not want them to have more power to control the overall population and they were united in that but it seems that there's now been this divide put down the middle where there's some elements now that love big government and some that are fighting against big government and big corporations and tech censorship overall.
[02:54:07.890 --> 02:54:14.571]  And I think it's because the left have realized that big government right now and the huge tech conglomerates are on their side.
[02:54:14.631 --> 02:54:20.072]  They are now trying to support them and saying, you know, you've heard the argument, oh, well, Twitter's a private company.
[02:54:20.152 --> 02:54:21.192]  Twitter can do what it wants.
[02:54:21.232 --> 02:54:25.933]  But the problem is Twitter now has the power to influence the outcome of elections.
[02:54:26.573 --> 02:54:30.254]  As a private company, can now choose what leaders run a country.
[02:54:30.274 --> 02:54:31.994]  No private company should have that power.
[02:54:32.034 --> 02:54:32.574]  Absolutely.
[02:54:32.874 --> 02:54:33.394]  Great points.
[02:54:33.414 --> 02:54:35.255]  Let's talk to Brad in Boston.
[02:54:35.295 --> 02:54:36.595]  Brad, you're on the air.
[02:54:36.655 --> 02:54:36.975]  Welcome.
[02:54:38.413 --> 02:54:41.775]  Hey, Alex, I just want to first of all, I want to plug real fast.
[02:54:42.235 --> 02:54:45.937]  I think the eight pack power stack is absolutely outstanding.
[02:54:45.957 --> 02:54:47.457]  I I've ordered it.
[02:54:47.577 --> 02:54:50.539]  I've actually, you know, reordered it.
[02:54:50.979 --> 02:54:51.719]  It's amazing.
[02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:52.340]  And thank you.
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:53.881]  It's a really awesome product.
[02:54:53.961 --> 02:54:54.741]  So thank you for that.
[02:54:54.901 --> 02:54:56.742]  It is the best A.M.P.M.
[02:54:56.802 --> 02:54:59.683]  system that gives you everything you need with the highest quality.
[02:54:59.703 --> 02:55:03.104]  We put a lot of money into it and it's not one of our best sellers.
[02:55:03.564 --> 02:55:04.404]  I thought it would be.
[02:55:04.924 --> 02:55:07.345]  It is for the amount of product in it.
[02:55:07.405 --> 02:55:08.766]  It's the best deal we've got.
[02:55:08.786 --> 02:55:09.626]  It's really crazy.
[02:55:10.646 --> 02:55:11.807]  Absolutely it is.
[02:55:12.087 --> 02:55:20.830]  But you know what I want to talk about was that I think that Tulsi Gabbard is the most outstanding candidate for president
[02:55:21.346 --> 02:55:29.289]  And if you really want to break the back of the military-industrial complex, she's the only candidate that you could possibly vote for.
[02:55:29.629 --> 02:55:30.849]  She absolutely is.
[02:55:32.350 --> 02:55:37.151]  Donald Trump is not doing anything to break the back of the military-industrial complex.
[02:55:37.211 --> 02:55:41.173]  And you can say whatever you want, but he's not doing it.
[02:55:41.493 --> 02:55:42.293]  He's not doing it, man.
[02:55:42.633 --> 02:55:44.014]  Sure, I mean, he's had good rhetoric.
[02:55:44.054 --> 02:55:45.014]  He's tried to pull them out.
[02:55:45.034 --> 02:55:47.315]  Of course, the troops want that.
[02:55:47.635 --> 02:55:48.415]  He's the president.
[02:55:48.455 --> 02:55:49.776]  He doesn't have to try.
[02:55:49.796 --> 02:55:50.616]  No, I agree.
[02:55:52.142 --> 02:55:52.842]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:55:53.243 --> 02:55:56.405]  All I hear is buzz about Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:55:56.445 --> 02:55:59.987]  And I first heard about her years ago on Joe Rogan, so kudos to him.
[02:56:00.408 --> 02:56:01.749]  And the left absolutely hates her.
[02:56:01.789 --> 02:56:02.689]  The New York Times hates her.
[02:56:03.029 --> 02:56:08.553]  And so I don't agree with some of her gun control things, but I wish she'd drop that.
[02:56:09.134 --> 02:56:12.996]  And I think that she'd be, look, light years better than any other Democrat.
[02:56:13.016 --> 02:56:15.358]  So why do you think there's so much buzz about her, Brad?
[02:56:16.719 --> 02:56:21.382]  Well, I think there's a lot of buzz about her because Google is trying to kill her.
[02:56:21.823 --> 02:56:22.283]  You know what I mean?
[02:56:22.363 --> 02:56:23.564]  Like, this is ridiculous.
[02:56:23.604 --> 02:56:28.485]  Like, as soon as she's actually suing Google, you know, which I think is awesome.
[02:56:28.905 --> 02:56:29.285]  Exactly.
[02:56:29.325 --> 02:56:37.568]  She's actually a liberal woman who's good-looking and smart and popular, so the people want her, you can't have her.
[02:56:38.655 --> 02:56:41.295]  Yeah, no, that's exactly what it is, Ben.
[02:56:41.335 --> 02:56:42.556]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:56:42.936 --> 02:56:47.437]  Look, you may not agree with all her politics, and I do.
[02:56:47.457 --> 02:56:52.137]  You know, I'm a liberal, and, you know, I... Sure, but we sure know the power structure is scared of her, which is a good thing.
[02:56:52.157 --> 02:56:59.539]  Yeah, well, that exactly is why they're scared of her, because she's actually a good person, you know?
[02:56:59.879 --> 02:57:04.960]  Well, they better not try to take her out of the debates, because I think if she stays in all the way, she'll beat Biden.
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:06.660]  And then Trump's got a big problem.
[02:57:07.816 --> 02:57:11.678]  Yes he does, because she's a veteran and he's a draft dodger.
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:32.290]  Well, I don't think getting deferments, I mean, he wasn't for the Vietnam War, I mean, even back then, so I think getting deferments if you're not a chicken haunt is, I don't want to get into a Trump bashing fest, but yeah, Tulsi Gabbard, she's very smart, very good looking, has a lot of good policies, and the left's afraid of her, the establishment left, so I like her.
[02:57:32.610 --> 02:57:34.151]  Let's get your take more on her when we come back.
[02:57:34.191 --> 02:57:34.832]  Thank you, Brad.
[02:57:35.652 --> 02:57:37.434]  A lot of excitement about Tulsi.
[02:57:38.015 --> 02:57:42.059]  And then we've got Andre, and Ryan, and Thomas, and then everybody else.
[02:57:42.099 --> 02:57:43.241]  We're getting to everybody.
[02:57:43.761 --> 02:57:46.845]  And then, Gerald Cilente, loaded for bears, taking over.
[02:57:47.786 --> 02:57:48.907]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:53.056 --> 02:57:55.297]  I'll take care of you now, and later.
[02:57:56.437 --> 02:58:04.459]  If you took your six-month-old baby and dropped it on its head on purpose, you would lose that child if you were seen doing it.
[02:58:05.039 --> 02:58:05.519]  And you should.
[02:58:06.759 --> 02:58:19.082]  If you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there, why there's mental illness everywhere, why people seem so incredibly stupid, it's because the Soviets, the communists,
[02:58:20.314 --> 02:58:35.942]  The proto-globalists that took over had work camps and they put hydrofluorosilic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the gulags.
[02:58:37.002 --> 02:58:45.827]  I went to HEB this morning, the crew did, walked right in and it says, HEB baby fluoride water.
[02:58:47.517 --> 02:58:48.638]  Let's zoom right in on that.
[02:58:48.998 --> 02:58:50.419]  And notice it shows you the target.
[02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:59.547]  It's kind of like buying a box of 30-odd-6 rifle shells, rifle rounds, and on the cover is a deer.
[02:58:59.567 --> 02:59:02.490]  And there's a little crosshair on the side of the deer.
[02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:18.831]  Maximum firepower!
[02:59:23.977 --> 02:59:26.360]  Oh, I mean... Oh, baby!
[02:59:26.761 --> 02:59:28.803]  It's time to kill brain cells!
[02:59:30.765 --> 02:59:33.288]  So much more fun to take our time.
[02:59:33.969 --> 02:59:37.974]  And then it's bye-bye brain, and you've got a good automaton.
[02:59:47.711 --> 02:59:48.472]  InfoWars.
[02:59:48.812 --> 02:59:50.453]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:59:56.658 --> 03:00:02.142]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:02.362 --> 03:00:09.888]  And we're back in the fourth hour.
[03:00:09.948 --> 03:00:11.309]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.810 --> 03:00:14.312]  Talking to Count Dankula, a political
[03:00:15.109 --> 03:00:18.151]  Former political president in the UK, and we can sit around and joke about this.
[03:00:18.551 --> 03:00:21.032]  There is massive leftist authoritarianism going on.
[03:00:21.592 --> 03:00:24.894]  Only really rivaled by the old Soviet Union all over the Western world.
[03:00:25.254 --> 03:00:25.635]  The U.S.
[03:00:25.675 --> 03:00:32.138]  is just a few years behind it, and they've got me in court cases trying to criminalize my speech as we speak right now.
[03:00:32.198 --> 03:00:35.220]  So this is a serious, concerted effort.
[03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:39.602]  We got callers from Sweden, Canada, New York City, everywhere.
[03:00:40.482 --> 03:00:41.263]  We're gonna go to
[03:00:42.850 --> 03:00:44.351]  Ryan and then Andre.
[03:00:44.491 --> 03:00:46.591]  Ryan in Florida, you're on the air with Count Dankula.
[03:00:47.452 --> 03:00:49.412]  Hey Alex and Count, it's great to talk to you both.
[03:00:50.273 --> 03:00:55.755]  I just wanted to thank you real quick for the Alexa Pure Water Filter, the X2, the Super 12, everything, man.
[03:00:55.775 --> 03:01:00.336]  I've been buying them for years and my wife's pregnant with our firstborn and she's super healthy and everything's going great.
[03:01:00.656 --> 03:01:06.939]  Brother, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here and we're, I don't want to say we're treading water, but we're not, you know, we don't have any fat, okay?
[03:01:07.379 --> 03:01:10.040]  And so we do need to keep buying the products.
[03:01:10.060 --> 03:01:10.320]  Thank you.
[03:01:10.851 --> 03:01:11.391]  I sure will, man.
[03:01:11.411 --> 03:01:11.691]  Thank you.
[03:01:11.731 --> 03:01:20.035]  And Count, man, you're just a hero, I think, and you're a really good example against how to stand up against your oppressive government and, you know, really stick it to them.
[03:01:20.055 --> 03:01:21.636]  So, you know, kudos to you, man.
[03:01:21.676 --> 03:01:29.280]  But I think you brought up something really key when you spoke about how you spoke to Nazis or all, you know, extreme right-wing people.
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:35.343]  I think the major blind spot of conservatives, libertarians, right-wing, you know, ring-wearers is that
[03:01:35.851 --> 03:01:42.779]  They don't talk to the people who are the white supremacists or the white nationalists or anything because they're afraid to get demonized by the left.
[03:01:43.139 --> 03:01:47.244]  And because they're already characterized as such, they don't want to host that kind of platform or whatever.
[03:01:47.604 --> 03:01:53.851]  But I think that if you actually listen to a lot of these extreme people, even the ones that aren't too extreme, they make way more sense.
[03:01:54.315 --> 03:01:54.415]  Yeah.
[03:02:11.673 --> 03:02:16.336]  That it's going to cause kind of a Nazi-like backlash, which I was saying at dinner last night.
[03:02:16.757 --> 03:02:23.181]  I think if we beat this, the long-term danger is getting a right-wing fascist government, because that's what big corporations want.
[03:02:23.201 --> 03:02:26.103]  They want a leftist fascist government or a right-wing fascist government.
[03:02:26.183 --> 03:02:29.646]  According to Carol Quigley, who was Bill Clinton's mentor, they designed this plan.
[03:02:30.146 --> 03:02:32.308]  And so I think, and I appreciate your call, that that's a danger.
[03:02:32.668 --> 03:02:35.409]  I think it's the problem is you just need to resist both of the extremes.
[03:02:35.449 --> 03:02:50.235]  You're going to get left-wing extremists, you're going to get right-wing extremists and people think that the way to deal with these people is just to completely exclude them from society, exclude them from social media, make them persona non grata, but all that does is places them into a bubble where they can only speak to other like-minded people
[03:02:50.955 --> 03:02:52.356]  I've tried to talk to anti-fund people and
[03:03:12.228 --> 03:03:13.068]  They just won't do it.
[03:03:13.448 --> 03:03:24.931]  And I've tried to talk to the Nazis and people too and they're either feds or controlled or they're like just they're mentally ill because all they think is everyone that isn't with them is a secret agent of Israel or something.
[03:03:25.192 --> 03:03:26.572]  I like barely think about Israel.
[03:03:26.592 --> 03:03:27.592]  I've never been to Israel.
[03:03:28.112 --> 03:03:32.454]  And just because I'm not for getting rid of Israel, it's like this fetish of obsessing over it.
[03:03:32.714 --> 03:03:34.254]  And if you want to get rid of Israel, that's your right.
[03:03:34.534 --> 03:03:36.615]  It's just that I'm just, it's on my radar screen.
[03:03:36.835 --> 03:03:37.475]  It's bizarre.
[03:03:38.086 --> 03:03:39.207]  No I get that as well.
[03:03:39.907 --> 03:03:40.628]  I get a lot of it.
[03:03:40.888 --> 03:03:44.591]  Apparently I'm a Mossad show because I don't speak about it.
[03:03:45.171 --> 03:03:48.754]  And it's like I don't even talk about it so I'm not sure where that connection came from.
[03:03:48.994 --> 03:03:50.615]  It's like I don't talk about Lebanon.
[03:03:50.735 --> 03:03:51.676]  I mean I don't talk about...
[03:03:53.203 --> 03:03:54.364]  Bing, bong, boom, boom.
[03:03:54.424 --> 03:04:00.908]  I mean, it's literally, I'm like into America and the Second Amendment and unborn babies being killed and new babies being killed.
[03:04:00.948 --> 03:04:04.450]  And, you know, trying to sexualize our kids and all this.
[03:04:04.490 --> 03:04:07.452]  And then it's just like, you better say it's the Catholics.
[03:04:07.492 --> 03:04:08.552]  You better say it's the Jews.
[03:04:08.612 --> 03:04:11.754]  And what it is, is it's corruption seeping into everything.
[03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:12.555]  It's good and evil.
[03:04:13.072 --> 03:04:16.416]  Yeah, I think it's just people, you know, every single side has their boogeyman.
[03:04:16.436 --> 03:04:18.197]  You know, for feminists, it's the patriarchy.
[03:04:18.257 --> 03:04:19.599]  For the far right, it's the Jews.
[03:04:19.659 --> 03:04:21.721]  For the far left, it's the capitalists.
[03:04:21.741 --> 03:04:24.023]  Just every single person has their boogeyman.
[03:04:24.524 --> 03:04:28.528]  Although the one, personally, my boogeyman's authoritarians, but I think mine's a lot more sensible.
[03:04:28.568 --> 03:04:29.789]  Which come in a bunch of flavors.
[03:04:29.809 --> 03:04:30.690]  Oh yeah, it does.
[03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:32.412]  They'll use any cosmology to do it.
[03:04:32.552 --> 03:04:33.673]  Oh yeah, it does it mildly.
[03:04:33.773 --> 03:04:36.034]  Authoritarians don't have a colour, a race or a gender.
[03:04:36.074 --> 03:04:37.815]  Authoritarians can be anyone, you know.
[03:04:37.855 --> 03:04:39.976]  It's not a racial or a gender thing.
[03:04:40.056 --> 03:04:43.538]  It's just a greed and corruption thing which can affect everyone.
[03:04:44.058 --> 03:04:45.899]  You know, corruption's actually very diverse.
[03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:55.704]  Well, I gotta say, we're gonna take this, my friend, and put this last two minutes right at the front of the last hour and a half because you nailed it right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:56.025 --> 03:04:58.446]  Stay with us, more calls straight ahead.
[03:05:04.648 --> 03:05:05.788]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[03:05:05.848 --> 03:05:06.509]  I've been so busy.
[03:05:06.609 --> 03:05:09.110]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[03:05:09.210 --> 03:05:10.290]  But it's very exciting.
[03:05:10.450 --> 03:05:12.671]  It's super silver skin cream.
[03:05:12.771 --> 03:05:14.232]  It's got all of these benefits.
[03:05:14.292 --> 03:05:15.332]  Too many to mention.
[03:05:15.372 --> 03:05:16.472]  But it's revolutionary.
[03:05:16.632 --> 03:05:17.493]  It's brand new.
[03:05:17.573 --> 03:05:18.353]  People are going to love it.
[03:05:18.433 --> 03:05:20.514]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.
[03:05:20.554 --> 03:05:21.114]  Exclusively at
[03:05:23.695 --> 03:05:26.135]  Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[03:05:26.175 --> 03:05:28.256]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[03:05:28.376 --> 03:05:32.117]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[03:05:32.137 --> 03:05:37.158]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[03:05:37.278 --> 03:05:48.260]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like coconut oil, vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[03:05:48.380 --> 03:05:50.400]  It's got the highly sought-after hyaluronic
[03:05:50.540 --> 03:05:52.821]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:53.482]  Willie Nelson, baby!
[03:06:20.101 --> 03:06:21.582]  And Merle Haggard.
[03:06:21.662 --> 03:06:25.885]  I tell you, Willie Nelson, folks, he is a living legend.
[03:06:26.466 --> 03:06:29.748]  He wrote back in the 50s, Patsy Cline Crazy!
[03:06:31.729 --> 03:06:34.131]  And he smoked pot with me under the table.
[03:06:35.472 --> 03:06:36.473]  And I'm not saying that's that cool.
[03:06:36.593 --> 03:06:37.934]  I did it only to test it.
[03:06:37.954 --> 03:06:38.974]  No, seriously.
[03:06:39.915 --> 03:06:43.518]  I was so stoned smoking pot with him one time, I had to have somebody come pick me up.
[03:06:43.538 --> 03:06:45.799]  I don't know why I'm telling that story right now.
[03:06:46.339 --> 03:06:47.060]  Here's Merle Haggard.
[03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:48.201]  He died last year.
[03:06:50.937 --> 03:06:52.838]  I gotta tell you kids, don't smoke marijuana.
[03:06:52.918 --> 03:06:54.059]  It's totally weaponized.
[03:06:54.659 --> 03:06:55.419]  It's out of control.
[03:06:55.539 --> 03:06:56.340]  I never smoke it.
[03:06:56.360 --> 03:06:57.840]  Not even, maybe once a year.
[03:06:58.401 --> 03:06:59.401]  And it's just amazing.
[03:06:59.501 --> 03:07:01.062]  And so many people I know here in this office...
[03:07:02.270 --> 03:07:08.373]  Have quit smoking marijuana because it messes up your REM sleep, it messes up your life, and it's just as bad as alcohol now.
[03:07:08.893 --> 03:07:11.674]  Back when I was in high school and smoked it some, it didn't do what it does now.
[03:07:11.734 --> 03:07:14.995]  This stuff is super powerful and will ruin your life.
[03:07:15.316 --> 03:07:17.637]  So I just made my little marijuana statement, it's true.
[03:07:17.657 --> 03:07:20.618]  You know, playing chess and smoking pot with Willie Nelson.
[03:07:20.938 --> 03:07:22.839]  We got to be too good of friends and his fifth wife
[03:07:23.639 --> 03:07:29.224]  A big liberal told him to stop hanging out with me, but that didn't even really happen, but I don't know why I'm talking about Willie Nelson.
[03:07:29.244 --> 03:07:30.845]  I just feel like he's getting really long in the tooth.
[03:07:31.265 --> 03:07:34.167]  And of course, we're sitting here, what's the best place to find your stuff on YouTube?
[03:07:34.508 --> 03:07:35.328]  Count Donkula?
[03:07:35.348 --> 03:07:38.271]  I mean, that's just all they search, Count Donkula or Count Dankula?
[03:07:38.551 --> 03:07:42.274]  I'm calling you Count Donkula, because I'm thinking of Carpe Donktum.
[03:07:42.594 --> 03:07:43.515]  And that's what I'm doing.
[03:07:43.555 --> 03:07:44.656]  I'm splicing two words.
[03:07:44.736 --> 03:07:45.677]  Count Donkula.
[03:07:45.897 --> 03:07:46.677]  Count Dankula.
[03:07:47.298 --> 03:07:49.620]  Count Dankula has a Count Donkula.
[03:07:50.682 --> 03:07:53.934]  Hey, but you and Count Donquill, I mean, you and Carpe Donquill got to hang out.
[03:07:54.466 --> 03:07:55.927]  Oh no, we haven't actually got to hang out yet.
[03:07:55.967 --> 03:07:57.907]  We've spoken a little bit on Twitter.
[03:07:57.927 --> 03:07:59.528]  I misunderstood your story.
[03:07:59.708 --> 03:08:00.168]  No, it's cool.
[03:08:00.208 --> 03:08:00.829]  I enjoy him though.
[03:08:00.849 --> 03:08:01.449]  He's very funny.
[03:08:01.469 --> 03:08:10.872]  I just love the fact that he just got famous through making pro-Trump memes and basically dunking on the Democrats all the time.
[03:08:11.052 --> 03:08:12.853]  They hate him.
[03:08:12.893 --> 03:08:15.974]  I think it was Huffington Post actually tried to dox him.
[03:08:16.054 --> 03:08:16.795]  They did dox him.
[03:08:17.155 --> 03:08:17.355]  Yeah.
[03:08:20.359 --> 03:08:21.220]  I can't do it, Captain.
[03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:21.960]  Don't have the power.
[03:08:22.201 --> 03:08:25.824]  You're going to make me say Shrek quotes next.
[03:08:25.924 --> 03:08:26.845]  Yeah, Shrek quotes.
[03:08:28.786 --> 03:08:30.968]  Oh, my love, we've got to fight the dragon.
[03:08:31.008 --> 03:08:31.589]  I can't do it right.
[03:08:31.729 --> 03:08:34.671]  I don't even think Shrek says that.
[03:08:35.812 --> 03:08:36.873]  Oh, donkey.
[03:08:37.453 --> 03:08:38.634]  What are you doing, donkey?
[03:08:38.654 --> 03:08:40.156]  It's more like a Mexican accent or Spanish.
[03:08:45.841 --> 03:08:47.362]  I don't want to be an ogre.
[03:08:48.633 --> 03:08:50.074]  Ah, the donkey, huh?
[03:08:50.714 --> 03:08:55.116]  More like puss in boots meets the... Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
[03:08:55.156 --> 03:08:55.996]  Give me a Shrek quote.
[03:08:56.116 --> 03:09:00.978]  A Shrek quote, um... Guys, put Shrek quotes on the screen, we gotta... Oh, come on!
[03:09:00.998 --> 03:09:01.418]  Right, okay.
[03:09:01.818 --> 03:09:05.039]  I know, I know the... Well, what are you doing in my swamp?
[03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:11.722]  Like, that's what... What are you doing in my swamp, donkey?
[03:09:11.942 --> 03:09:16.224]  Yeah, um... I can't even actually remember any other ones, that's the one that people make me say.
[03:09:18.166 --> 03:09:19.287]  Aye, what are you doing in my swamp?
[03:09:19.547 --> 03:09:20.808]  You don't have the power, Captain.
[03:09:21.589 --> 03:09:22.649]  I can't do it, Captain.
[03:09:22.709 --> 03:09:23.690]  I don't have the power.
[03:09:26.933 --> 03:09:29.935]  Here, give me a punch to the shoulder.
[03:09:29.955 --> 03:09:30.895]  This is kind of racist.
[03:09:30.996 --> 03:09:33.237]  Oh, no.
[03:09:33.457 --> 03:09:33.958]  Oh, exactly.
[03:09:33.998 --> 03:09:36.960]  We're just joking about Scott's cool accent.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.001]  Like, I'll do kind of exaggerated Texas accents.
[03:09:39.262 --> 03:09:40.262]  You know, I can do Yosemite Sam.
[03:09:41.243 --> 03:09:42.504]  I hate rabbits.
[03:09:45.469 --> 03:09:46.449]  That's pretty good, actually, yeah.
[03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:48.310]  I hate rabbits.
[03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:50.891]  I gotta get some... Give me some Yosemite Sam quotes.
[03:09:51.312 --> 03:09:53.613]  You know, we've got Gerald Celente coming up, but I don't want to cut this time.
[03:09:53.633 --> 03:09:54.293]  He's such a sweetheart.
[03:09:54.313 --> 03:09:57.614]  He knows I do this overdraft thing, but this is hard to stop this broadcast.
[03:09:57.894 --> 03:09:58.995]  You're back tomorrow, though!
[03:09:59.295 --> 03:10:00.155]  Yeah.
[03:10:00.195 --> 03:10:00.816]  And Wednesday!
[03:10:01.056 --> 03:10:01.276]  Yeah.
[03:10:01.616 --> 03:10:02.837]  We're gonna make you live here!
[03:10:03.997 --> 03:10:06.538]  Hey, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[03:10:06.638 --> 03:10:07.919]  Andre, I apologize from Canada.
[03:10:07.959 --> 03:10:08.819]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:10:10.580 --> 03:10:12.101]  Why are you in my swamp, Andre?
[03:10:12.941 --> 03:10:13.201]  Yes.
[03:10:13.441 --> 03:10:14.101]  Bonjour, Alex.
[03:10:14.222 --> 03:10:14.882]  Bonjour, Count.
[03:10:15.598 --> 03:10:21.423]  Welcome, my friend.
[03:10:21.803 --> 03:10:24.065]  Yeah, we don't have that accent over here in Quebec.
[03:10:24.205 --> 03:10:25.226]  Sorry, I apologize.
[03:10:25.946 --> 03:10:26.647]  That's all good, man.
[03:10:31.199 --> 03:10:39.002]  But it's funny how Americans use a lot of French quotes like bon appétit or déjà vu.
[03:10:39.662 --> 03:10:42.703]  I find that really cool.
[03:10:42.723 --> 03:10:43.943]  You gotta love that one.
[03:10:45.204 --> 03:10:49.065]  Listen Alex, I got to say that thank you so much for your products.
[03:10:49.125 --> 03:10:50.745]  I must have a thousand dollars worth of products.
[03:10:50.785 --> 03:10:55.647]  My girlfriend was pissed off because I was taking so much counter that she put it on a three-story shelf.
[03:10:56.968 --> 03:10:58.308]  I have so much of your product.
[03:10:58.569 --> 03:11:06.173]  And two, three weeks ago, I slipped and slipped the back of my head on the kitchen table really bad.
[03:11:06.213 --> 03:11:07.374]  I knocked myself out.
[03:11:08.535 --> 03:11:12.617]  She found me on the floor, took three beach towels just to clean everything up.
[03:11:12.777 --> 03:11:15.139]  But you're a super silver wound gel, bud.
[03:11:15.965 --> 03:11:16.666]  Help me out.
[03:11:16.967 --> 03:11:21.495]  It cleared and it stitched in two days with your product.
[03:11:22.176 --> 03:11:24.520]  And I could have used at least 10 stitches.
[03:11:25.061 --> 03:11:27.866]  But your products are amazing.
[03:11:28.866 --> 03:11:31.949]  I can't believe the reports we're getting on the super silver wound gel.
[03:11:31.989 --> 03:11:33.731]  I mean, I always knew it was good and hospitals used it.
[03:11:34.011 --> 03:11:38.396]  We use Private Label, the top one in the world, but we're just blessed that they're listeners and let us do this.
[03:11:38.416 --> 03:11:40.117]  So, thank you for that testimonial.
[03:11:40.498 --> 03:11:43.281]  A lot of folks are doing testimonials down on the show, so thank you for the support, brother.
[03:11:43.781 --> 03:11:46.304]  What's your view on speech criticizing Muslims go to jail?
[03:11:46.912 --> 03:11:58.900]  Well, listen, our libtard Prime Sinister Trudeau passed a law which is the M103 that if you criticize Islam, well, you go to jail.
[03:12:00.901 --> 03:12:02.442]  Why you in my swamp, donkey?
[03:12:04.443 --> 03:12:06.524]  It's just absolute authoritarianism.
[03:12:06.725 --> 03:12:07.845]  Everything, absolutely.
[03:12:07.885 --> 03:12:14.630]  Oh, they're all passing the same laws everywhere and then the Muslims who aren't radical don't have a voice because the radical ones are
[03:12:16.021 --> 03:12:16.961]  What, paying off the government?
[03:12:16.981 --> 03:12:17.382]  What's happening?
[03:12:17.402 --> 03:12:18.902]  What do you think is happening, Andre, in Canada?
[03:12:19.622 --> 03:12:22.143]  Well, listen, Alex, just a quick example.
[03:12:22.603 --> 03:12:31.787]  There was a shooting in a mosque in Quebec that a Muslim convinced a Quebecer to walk in there with a gun and shoot people.
[03:12:32.067 --> 03:12:43.171]  I mean, the Quebecer had some mental issues, but the Muslim was gay, he was refused by the mosque, so he convinced the Quebecer to go inside and shoot somebody.
[03:12:44.432 --> 03:12:45.092]  Terrible news.
[03:12:46.112 --> 03:12:53.158]  But the guy's name is Alexandre Bissonnette and he's the one who got jailed and not the Muslims.
[03:12:53.218 --> 03:13:01.865]  So now, I think it was last week or two weeks ago, a Muslim acid attacked his girlfriend and they're not talking about it.
[03:13:02.805 --> 03:13:04.226]  There's an incredible blackout.
[03:13:04.266 --> 03:13:05.988]  God bless you and glad to hear you got better Andre.
[03:13:07.185 --> 03:13:10.206]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we are with Count Donkula Supreme.
[03:13:10.226 --> 03:13:12.187]  I did all that on purpose.
[03:13:12.227 --> 03:13:12.847]  I'll tell you that.
[03:13:12.887 --> 03:13:14.548]  It makes them want to know your name even more.
[03:13:14.568 --> 03:13:15.748]  They must.
[03:13:15.868 --> 03:13:17.789]  It's Count Dankula.
[03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.649]  Yes.
[03:13:18.669 --> 03:13:19.050]  All right.
[03:13:19.170 --> 03:13:23.291]  Remember, remember, remember the map.
[03:13:23.651 --> 03:13:25.652]  Remember what I have told you.
[03:13:25.672 --> 03:13:28.173]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:13:28.473 --> 03:13:29.534]  We're having some fun now.
[03:13:29.694 --> 03:13:30.094]  We are.
[03:13:30.274 --> 03:13:30.594]  We are.
[03:13:30.654 --> 03:13:32.715]  Hey, by the way, you quit smoking pot, you were saying.
[03:13:33.140 --> 03:13:36.482]  Well, I only smoke, yeah, no I don't smoke pot at all.
[03:13:36.522 --> 03:13:39.044]  You said you cut back 98%, let's see.
[03:13:39.284 --> 03:13:41.426]  Yes, 98% I cut back.
[03:13:42.226 --> 03:13:43.927]  Alright, let's take a ring-a-dingy here.
[03:13:44.928 --> 03:13:51.112]  Jackson in Missouri, you're on the air worldwide with His Supreme Highness, Count Donkula.
[03:13:52.273 --> 03:13:53.333]  I really appreciate it.
[03:13:53.414 --> 03:13:57.036]  I just wanted to get you guys' opinion on this whole censorship issue.
[03:13:57.851 --> 03:13:58.071]  I'm good.
[03:14:20.313 --> 03:14:27.560]  About basically where that's coming from and... Well, that one guy, Hassan Pecker, you know, said that he loved 9-11.
[03:14:28.261 --> 03:14:35.328]  He said that he wanted to use his, literally, he said, I want to use my, and his last name, to rape members of Congress in the eye.
[03:14:35.348 --> 03:14:36.830]  I'm not going to quote it all, but I mean...
[03:14:37.330 --> 03:14:38.630]  Yeah, that was the thing.
[03:14:38.811 --> 03:14:45.173]  He did end up ultimately getting banned from Twitch and I don't think that he should have been... I mean, if he wants to say crazy, outrageous stuff, then that's fine.
[03:14:45.213 --> 03:14:46.313]  He can go ahead and say that.
[03:14:46.773 --> 03:14:48.133]  If it's really a threat, it's up to the police.
[03:14:48.153 --> 03:14:48.954]  I agree.
[03:14:49.094 --> 03:14:52.575]  He has a right to say that he wants somebody to rape the congressman in his eye hole.
[03:14:53.035 --> 03:15:07.763]  Yeah, no, it was about Senator Dan Crenshaw and he says that because Dan lost his eye duty in an IED attack, he says that a brave ISIS soldier, he called the soldier brave, a brave soldier was the person that did that to Dan Crenshaw's eye.
[03:15:08.163 --> 03:15:10.224]  I mean, he was basically saying that ISIS were brave.
[03:15:10.284 --> 03:15:15.687]  Look at his, I'm not being mean here, but I mean, he's got some large breasts and big ol' flabby arms.
[03:15:15.707 --> 03:15:17.607]  Doesn't look like that guy's going to be carrying anything out.
[03:15:17.968 --> 03:15:20.329]  How about him and Dan Crenshaw get in the ring and see what happens?
[03:15:20.729 --> 03:15:21.970]  I'm pretty sure Dan would win.
[03:15:22.330 --> 03:15:24.071]  Yeah, I have no doubt that Dan would win.
[03:15:25.612 --> 03:15:28.134]  But, I mean, obviously the guy has the right to free speech.
[03:15:28.154 --> 03:15:31.616]  He's killed a brave soldier, raping him in the eye, and said he likes 9-11.
[03:15:31.836 --> 03:15:33.237]  It's horrible, it's offensive, but he has a right.
[03:15:33.757 --> 03:15:34.578]  Yeah, he absolutely has a right.
[03:15:34.598 --> 03:15:36.719]  But why does the left get away with constantly doing this then?
[03:15:37.199 --> 03:15:38.740]  Well, I'm not sure why it is.
[03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:41.021]  I think it's because the right is perceived as more of the threat.
[03:15:41.301 --> 03:15:45.824]  Basically, we actually debate, we actually talk to people, we actually can defend our ideas.
[03:15:45.884 --> 03:15:49.085]  You know, the far left... That's right, let's finish up and say hi to Gerald Cilente.
[03:15:49.385 --> 03:15:52.207]  But just one more Shrek quote when we come back.
[03:15:52.227 --> 03:15:52.387]  Fine.
[03:15:53.848 --> 03:15:55.168]  What are you doing in my swamp?
[03:15:55.689 --> 03:15:56.149]  Donkey.
[03:15:56.509 --> 03:15:56.969]  Donkey.
[03:15:56.989 --> 03:15:59.931]  Alright, but I need another one when we come back.
[03:16:03.328 --> 03:16:14.776]  We were winning, Antifa was over, the culture wars had been won, it was time to gloat, we were winning the meme war, everyone was laughing, and then...
[03:16:16.109 --> 03:16:20.290]  You get depersoned to the point where you don't exist.
[03:16:20.530 --> 03:16:22.111]  Like, Laura Loomer had to leave New York.
[03:16:22.851 --> 03:16:25.252]  She's living in a place I don't think I can even say.
[03:16:25.272 --> 03:16:28.072]  Across from a police station so they can get there fast.
[03:16:28.672 --> 03:16:31.413]  Steven Crowder's had to move many times.
[03:16:31.853 --> 03:16:33.394]  Dana Lash's had to move.
[03:16:33.894 --> 03:16:36.415]  And when these people move, they don't make it a slow decision.
[03:16:36.435 --> 03:16:38.355]  They have to pack up in the middle of the night.
[03:16:38.655 --> 03:16:39.595]  I'm gonna have to move.
[03:16:42.824 --> 03:16:47.468]  Tommy Robinson has to move, and he has done so several times.
[03:16:49.909 --> 03:17:06.181]  So, I think you have these negligent, family-less media sources trivializing these allegations because it makes for a salacious headline, but they don't realize that they endanger people's lives, and like, they put these people's children in danger.
[03:17:07.452 --> 03:17:22.797]  You know, Dana Lash's kids have a, have a, you know, most, most, actually I shouldn't just say Dana Lash, most of these conservatives have spoken to their principals about attack plans and what happens if there's a threat to the school, not to the school, but to the student or something like that.
[03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:32.374]  So, it's a strange dichotomy where you have this incredibly severe punishment for the right.
[03:17:33.315 --> 03:17:36.597]  But the people doling out the punishment are these flaky babysitters.
[03:17:37.257 --> 03:17:40.079]  Like the SPLC can shut down my life.
[03:17:40.659 --> 03:17:44.341]  And then you read their articles and it says, you want bigots, Gavin?
[03:17:44.381 --> 03:17:45.382]  This is how you get bigots.
[03:17:45.762 --> 03:17:47.363]  Talking like a bratty babysitter.
[03:17:48.064 --> 03:17:49.645]  So, you have
[03:17:51.112 --> 03:17:55.918]  You have someone who wants to replace the judicial system, basically, with their own kangaroo court.
[03:17:56.578 --> 03:18:00.803]  SPLC is like that, ABL is like that, the media is like that, they're judge, jury, and executioner.
[03:18:00.823 --> 03:18:04.948]  And you think, okay, if you're going to take over hundreds of years of justice,
[03:18:06.089 --> 03:18:13.355]  You better be real thorough, because you're basically saying you're better than millions of people in hundreds of years, maybe thousands of years.
[03:18:14.235 --> 03:18:15.817]  And then they're so flippant about it.
[03:18:16.357 --> 03:18:18.199]  So they're doing this the same with conservatives.
[03:18:18.219 --> 03:18:24.463]  They're just sort of assuming someone said something, taking it out of context, and then just destroying it.
[03:18:24.563 --> 03:18:28.126]  But it's been an underhanded trick of warfare for a long time.
[03:18:28.146 --> 03:18:31.309]  I mean, the English did it to the Americans in the American Revolution.
[03:18:31.769 --> 03:18:34.071]  The English did it to the Boers in the Boer War.
[03:18:36.777 --> 03:18:39.059]  It's a common trick that the weak people do.
[03:18:39.499 --> 03:18:41.721]  It's a common trick people do who don't have families.
[03:18:41.741 --> 03:18:51.467]  And so they say, I'm going to call this guy a Nazi without thinking that his son is going to get, you know, accosted due to these rumors.
[03:18:52.408 --> 03:18:53.609]  I don't think they really believe it.
[03:18:54.669 --> 03:19:00.835]  When they talk about white supremacy, I don't believe them that they think it's a big threat.
[03:19:00.855 --> 03:19:03.577]  I think they're just, it's a game to them.
[03:19:04.438 --> 03:19:08.261]  And it's kind of the problem with the death of the family is everything becomes a silly game.
[03:19:09.362 --> 03:19:12.545]  Make no mistake, it's, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:19:13.406 --> 03:19:15.327]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:19:17.489 --> 03:19:19.191]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[03:19:22.096 --> 03:19:24.878]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[03:19:25.219 --> 03:19:26.299]  It's a form of fascism.
[03:19:26.319 --> 03:19:30.883]  The high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[03:19:30.983 --> 03:19:37.708]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:19:42.312 --> 03:19:45.755]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[03:19:53.914 --> 03:19:55.155]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:19:57.877 --> 03:19:58.858]  You can't watch this.
[03:19:59.238 --> 03:20:02.621]  The movie available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:20:05.584 --> 03:20:08.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.059 --> 03:20:24.001]  Johnny Cash.
[03:20:27.245 --> 03:20:30.208]  I hurt myself today.
[03:20:30.228 --> 03:20:32.771]  Alright, well this has been a pretty amazing transmission.
[03:20:32.811 --> 03:20:35.595]  Gerald Cilente, who I hate to cut into his time, takes over.
[03:20:36.015 --> 03:20:39.520]  In the War Room, Owen Schroer is back and is he firing on all cylinders.
[03:20:40.100 --> 03:20:40.381]  3 p.m.
[03:20:40.421 --> 03:20:41.702]  Central Standard Time and I'm told
[03:20:42.723 --> 03:20:44.944]  That our good guest, Count Dankula, is going to be with him as well.
[03:20:44.964 --> 03:20:46.085]  He'll be back with us tomorrow.
[03:20:46.485 --> 03:20:50.406]  And I promise to all those callers that were there, call us back tomorrow.
[03:20:50.426 --> 03:20:50.806]  We'll get to you.
[03:20:50.846 --> 03:20:54.508]  We got to a lot of calls today, but I hate to leave people on hold, so I apologize again.
[03:20:55.288 --> 03:20:57.969]  But, Count, it's been great having you here.
[03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:59.670]  You'll be with us through most of the week.
[03:21:00.490 --> 03:21:02.151]  Very, very exciting, so thank you.
[03:21:02.411 --> 03:21:02.911]  No problem, Mike.
[03:21:02.931 --> 03:21:04.132]  We'll just go hang out in just a second.
[03:21:04.472 --> 03:21:06.553]  Now, Gerald Cilente.
[03:21:07.731 --> 03:21:10.513]  Gerald Solente has fired the bat signal.
[03:21:10.993 --> 03:21:13.115]  He really wants this message to get to President Trump.
[03:21:13.855 --> 03:21:23.562]  And we're live right now, but when we post this later to Infowars.com and Newswars.com, if you get it and send it to the White House, and they get it a thousand times, they get that to the President.
[03:21:23.622 --> 03:21:36.912]  I can make a few phone calls, try to get it to him as well, but Gerald said, listen, Trump's totally right about this, and if he just does this and gets this in the people's minds, we can win this critical trade war
[03:21:38.126 --> 03:21:43.949]  It's the equivalent of the Bretton Woods Agreement that set America into the next century of dominance.
[03:21:44.430 --> 03:21:45.850]  So they're saying it's the Chinese century.
[03:21:45.870 --> 03:21:48.452]  Well, that's the Chai Com century, and that's not going to happen.
[03:21:48.472 --> 03:21:58.717]  And to see our own corporations, our own media, trying to side against America and American workers and Trump, and trying to kill the economy and cheerleading to implode it, it's just unspeakable.
[03:21:58.737 --> 03:22:00.939]  But if there's a way to really turn our economy around for real,
[03:22:01.599 --> 03:22:03.360]  It's what Gerald Celente is about to cover.
[03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:08.302]  So here is his emergency message, the top trends forecaster, Gerald Celente to President Trump.
[03:22:09.783 --> 03:22:16.046]  Yes, President Trump, you know, I don't agree with you on a number of issues, particularly your foreign policy.
[03:22:16.886 --> 03:22:26.911]  I support your positions on not bringing in illegal immigrants and lowering the amount of immigrants coming into the country until we get back on our feet.
[03:22:28.393 --> 03:22:34.534]  Your message that we don't need China is one that is 100% correct.
[03:22:35.474 --> 03:22:38.115]  Love Trump, hate Trump has nothing to do with Trump.
[03:22:38.195 --> 03:22:40.755]  It has to do with what he said and the facts behind it.
[03:22:41.655 --> 03:22:42.556]  The fact is this.
[03:22:43.796 --> 03:22:46.256]  You don't have to go very far back in history.
[03:22:47.196 --> 03:22:48.957]  All you have to do is go back to 1996.
[03:22:48.997 --> 03:22:50.137]  China, 5% of its population.
[03:22:56.089 --> 03:22:58.271]  Back then, it was about middle class.
[03:22:58.871 --> 03:22:59.212]  Today, 35%.
[03:23:00.773 --> 03:23:01.093]  Why?
[03:23:02.415 --> 03:23:05.838]  No, they didn't steal our technology.
[03:23:07.959 --> 03:23:15.066]  Now, the manufacturers, Americans and the Europeans, gave it to them.
[03:23:16.047 --> 03:23:16.847]  Here's the deal.
[03:23:17.728 --> 03:23:20.050]  Yeah, you could come over here, you could do business with us.
[03:23:20.070 --> 03:23:22.092]  We've got 1.4 billion people.
[03:23:23.069 --> 03:23:24.489]  But you can't own the company.
[03:23:24.509 --> 03:23:26.650]  You only can own 49% of it.
[03:23:26.910 --> 03:23:29.331]  And we want all your technology, because we don't have anything.
[03:23:30.691 --> 03:23:32.672]  We do not need China.
[03:23:32.812 --> 03:23:34.012]  China needs us.
[03:23:34.392 --> 03:23:36.953]  Let's make this 100% clear.
[03:23:38.674 --> 03:23:48.937]  When we were making clothing, now 96% of it, everything we wear from shoes to shirts, to pants, you name it, comes from overseas.
[03:23:48.997 --> 03:23:50.537]  We were making it in America.
[03:23:51.673 --> 03:24:02.836]  We don't need China to make what we are wearing, what we are eating, as they're bringing in apples and all other kinds of fruits and vegetables.
[03:24:03.477 --> 03:24:05.257]  We don't need China.
[03:24:05.597 --> 03:24:12.599]  We didn't need them up until slick Willy slimeball murderous Clinton.
[03:24:13.179 --> 03:24:14.900]  And I say that murderous because
[03:24:15.959 --> 03:24:19.703]  Oh no, I'm not conspiracy theory about Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:24:20.183 --> 03:24:25.489]  I'm talking about all the people he slaughtered during his time in Iraq in the Kosovo War.
[03:24:26.129 --> 03:24:36.780]  But anyway, before they brought China into the World Trade Organization, we weren't getting all our toys made over there, all our
[03:24:37.279 --> 03:24:41.603]  Parts and for automobiles and all our apples.
[03:24:41.943 --> 03:24:46.026]  Oh, not only those apples, the one we eat, but the other apples.
[03:24:46.487 --> 03:24:49.009]  They were making it in America.
[03:24:49.449 --> 03:24:54.934]  The only way this country is going to come back is to be a self-sustaining economy.
[03:24:55.680 --> 03:24:58.241]  President Trump, stay on the one message.
[03:24:58.662 --> 03:25:00.983]  We don't need China.
[03:25:01.303 --> 03:25:04.165]  Matter of fact, we don't even need China, China.
[03:25:04.585 --> 03:25:09.828]  I have a bunch of China that they used to make up here just north of me from Syracuse, New York.
[03:25:10.548 --> 03:25:14.791]  And when I went to school in West Virginia, beautiful glassware that was made.
[03:25:15.757 --> 03:25:17.679]  We don't need China.
[03:25:17.719 --> 03:25:28.708]  We don't need one foreign country to make what we are eating, what we are wearing, what we are watching, and what we are listening to.
[03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:31.571]  We need Americans to make it.
[03:25:32.531 --> 03:25:34.073]  It's very simple.
[03:25:35.254 --> 03:25:41.239]  The only people that are profiting from using slave labor in China
[03:25:42.581 --> 03:25:45.342]  Are the multinational manufacturers.
[03:25:45.822 --> 03:25:48.082]  Oh, Bill Gates doesn't have enough dough yet?
[03:25:48.462 --> 03:25:49.823]  How about Tim Cook?
[03:25:50.403 --> 03:25:59.284]  Yeah, get more stuff made over China so you could bring the product back over here, raise the prices, and make more money.
[03:25:59.785 --> 03:26:01.645]  You're not creating jobs.
[03:26:01.905 --> 03:26:04.245]  You're only creating wealth for yourself.
[03:26:04.926 --> 03:26:11.447]  Nike, Levi Strauss, Apple, all of the rest.
[03:26:12.324 --> 03:26:19.606]  Trump needs to stay on this one message, one message, and he will win again.
[03:26:20.466 --> 03:26:22.386]  We don't need China.
[03:26:23.046 --> 03:26:24.887]  We don't need anybody.
[03:26:25.287 --> 03:26:26.767]  We are America.
[03:26:27.688 --> 03:26:38.110]  We have more human and natural resources that are so rich that we have here that we could be perfectly
[03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:43.542]  Self-sustaining economy and bring the whole system up.
[03:26:44.102 --> 03:26:47.683]  We don't need China for anything.
[03:26:49.004 --> 03:26:50.144]  Chinese food.
[03:26:50.404 --> 03:26:56.226]  OK, if they use better products, because I don't eat a lot of Chinese stuff.
[03:26:56.666 --> 03:26:58.467]  I'm not an MSG fan.
[03:26:58.887 --> 03:26:59.207]  Yeah.
[03:27:00.048 --> 03:27:04.049]  The only thing we need from China is Chinese food.
[03:27:04.622 --> 03:27:05.222]  Period.
[03:27:05.582 --> 03:27:06.302]  Paragraph.
[03:27:06.722 --> 03:27:16.604]  We don't need anything from any other country, unless, of course, you want a fine French wine, or great Italian cheese and pasta.
[03:27:16.844 --> 03:27:17.904]  Yeah, that kind of stuff.
[03:27:17.964 --> 03:27:18.525]  Bring it in.
[03:27:19.305 --> 03:27:22.065]  Different cultures make things better than we do here.
[03:27:23.005 --> 03:27:24.826]  But not on a general level.
[03:27:25.266 --> 03:27:32.007]  I remember as a kid growing up in New York, and on 7th Avenue down the city, people pushing up
[03:27:32.845 --> 03:27:35.426]  Racks of clothing in the Garment District!
[03:27:35.746 --> 03:27:37.426]  The Garment District!
[03:27:37.766 --> 03:27:39.406]  Now it's a Gone District!
[03:27:39.646 --> 03:27:45.228]  Just a bunch of ugly glass buildings, and all multinational shops.
[03:27:45.648 --> 03:27:53.069]  Banks on every corner, and Duane Reade drugstores, and CVS, and F-you-know-what.
[03:27:53.989 --> 03:27:55.350]  That's what's taking over.
[03:27:56.770 --> 03:27:58.930]  And the people can't afford to live there anymore.
[03:27:59.190 --> 03:27:59.771]  They're leaving!
[03:28:00.151 --> 03:28:00.651]  They're leaving.
[03:28:00.711 --> 03:28:01.911]  People are leaving New York City.
[03:28:02.577 --> 03:28:10.142]  In fact, they're coming up to Kingston and other places where there's beauty and lifestyle, because it's all gone there.
[03:28:10.522 --> 03:28:17.207]  Trump's one message, we don't need China for anything!
[03:28:18.148 --> 03:28:25.433]  And stay out of the South China Sea, let those people over there solve their own problems, not my business.
[03:28:25.873 --> 03:28:28.535]  I'm worried about securing America the homeland.
[03:28:29.816 --> 03:28:31.777]  We don't need China!
[03:28:32.253 --> 03:28:34.015]  We don't need China.
[03:28:34.415 --> 03:28:37.318]  We don't need China.
[03:28:37.338 --> 03:28:40.521]  320 million Americans should be chanting that.
[03:28:41.461 --> 03:28:42.903]  We don't need China.
[03:28:43.283 --> 03:28:44.464]  We need America.
[03:28:45.305 --> 03:28:46.566]  Bring back the jobs.
[03:28:47.367 --> 03:28:48.528]  Bring back the riches.
[03:28:49.348 --> 03:28:50.650]  Bring back the spirit.
[03:28:52.411 --> 03:28:53.973]  And I'll be back in a little bit.
[03:28:54.153 --> 03:28:57.296]  And don't forget, support InfoWars.
[03:28:57.636 --> 03:28:58.577]  Put your money where your heart is.
[03:29:07.825 --> 03:29:11.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[03:29:11.630 --> 03:29:13.832]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[03:29:14.053 --> 03:29:14.894]  This is not a movie.
[03:29:14.914 --> 03:29:15.735]  This is not a drill.
[03:29:15.775 --> 03:29:16.616]  This is not fiction.
[03:29:17.076 --> 03:29:18.378]  This is reality.
[03:29:19.079 --> 03:29:25.863]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[03:29:26.043 --> 03:29:29.124]  Pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[03:29:29.164 --> 03:29:30.565]  So, Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[03:29:30.585 --> 03:29:32.546]  And I'll say this, it's all of our birthright.
[03:29:32.606 --> 03:29:38.329]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:40.530]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:45.553]  We're seeing election meddling, and it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor.
[03:29:45.933 --> 03:29:46.113]  I think?
[03:30:01.863 --> 03:30:06.565]  We wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[03:30:06.685 --> 03:30:12.047]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[03:30:12.167 --> 03:30:18.910]  It's the big, giant 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, but only on 50-something items.
[03:30:19.130 --> 03:30:21.991]  Not on every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[03:30:22.051 --> 03:30:27.773]  Whether it's Ultimate Krill Oil, Bodies Turmeric, Brain Force Plus, Knockout Sleep Aid, Turbo Force, 8-Pack Power Stack,
[03:30:27.953 --> 03:30:31.876]  It's all 50 to 60 percent off and your purchases make it all possible here.
[03:30:31.976 --> 03:30:43.826]  But an incredible time to be alive, an incredible time to be making history together and standing up and seeing the good guys wake up and to see us coming back from zero to basically tying the globalists right now for a football analogy.
[03:30:44.026 --> 03:30:46.428]  So back to Owen Schroer and Zach Vortes.
[03:30:46.569 --> 03:30:49.351]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to U.S.
[03:30:49.411 --> 03:30:49.831]  elections?
[03:30:50.312 --> 03:30:53.915]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's
[03:30:54.665 --> 03:31:09.184]  Google, together with Facebook, together with Twitter, they formed this echo chamber in which if they want to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going to press down the voices.
[03:31:09.745 --> 03:31:12.587]  That they don't want, and they're going to boost up the voices that they do.
[03:31:12.667 --> 03:31:17.090]  And InfoWars has been sort of the main victim in this.
[03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:30.139]  And it's clear that if your audience looks through the disclosure list posted at ProjectVeritas.com, they're going to see InfoWars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[03:31:30.319 --> 03:31:35.762]  Google's mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
[03:31:35.882 --> 03:31:41.226]  When InfoWars was taken offline, was that making information universally accessible and useful?
[03:31:41.246 --> 03:31:41.866]  No, it wasn't.
[03:31:42.106 --> 03:31:48.630]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[03:31:48.690 --> 03:31:49.291]  elections?
[03:31:49.771 --> 03:31:53.834]  And what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[03:31:55.494 --> 03:31:57.615]  Yeah, well, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[03:31:57.795 --> 03:31:59.536]  Like, there's been a huge document dump.
[03:31:59.596 --> 03:32:04.858]  I've released over 950 pages, and right now there is a crowd raid.
[03:32:05.819 --> 03:32:14.843]  There are a bunch of users, they're looking at these documents, they're digesting them, and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[03:32:15.403 --> 03:32:20.425]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online
[03:32:21.045 --> 03:32:24.346]  You know, go to Project Veritas, see their disclosure.
[03:32:24.366 --> 03:32:26.247]  They posted a link to all these documents.
[03:32:26.407 --> 03:32:31.109]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything.zip file and just go to town.
[03:32:31.249 --> 03:32:36.091]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google's doing, I promise you, it's way, way worse.
[03:32:36.291 --> 03:32:40.973]  And, you know, I see the reaction online and everyone's like, you know, WTF?
[03:32:41.233 --> 03:32:41.813]  WTF?
[03:32:41.933 --> 03:32:47.075]  And I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen, uh, privately.
[03:32:47.095 --> 03:32:48.656]  Uh, and, you know,
[03:32:49.176 --> 03:32:57.926]  We're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness and people are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[03:33:06.655 --> 03:33:09.237]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.615 --> 03:33:27.216]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:27.536 --> 03:33:36.679]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:38.120 --> 03:33:41.321]  Hey, great being here on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.141 --> 03:33:47.924]  Anyway, as I was saying, we don't need China for anything.
[03:33:49.224 --> 03:33:49.684]  Anything.
[03:33:50.365 --> 03:33:52.225]  You like Chinese food?
[03:33:52.285 --> 03:33:53.666]  Great, but you get that over here.
[03:33:55.578 --> 03:33:57.259]  We need to make everything here.
[03:33:57.459 --> 03:33:58.640]  Trump's quote last week.
[03:33:58.720 --> 03:34:02.063]  This is the way the Financial Times wrote it.
[03:34:02.483 --> 03:34:05.685]  Trump tirade alarms investors.
[03:34:06.006 --> 03:34:06.566]  Ooh!
[03:34:07.006 --> 03:34:09.368]  Don't alarm investors!
[03:34:09.869 --> 03:34:12.470]  Don't alarm the multinationals!
[03:34:12.851 --> 03:34:15.112]  They gotta make more money!
[03:34:17.394 --> 03:34:23.919]  Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for alternatives to China
[03:34:24.577 --> 03:34:31.758]  Including bringing your companies home, all the capitals home and making your products in the USA.
[03:34:33.019 --> 03:34:34.019]  You got it.
[03:34:34.999 --> 03:34:41.120]  It is the, I've been saying this by the way, long before Trump, in our Trends Journal.
[03:34:41.180 --> 03:34:44.881]  And if you want to subscribe to the Trends Journal, it's trendsjournal.com.
[03:34:45.261 --> 03:34:50.422]  And we have a discount request page because we know a lot of people are having a tough time, but it's only $129 a year.
[03:34:52.625 --> 03:34:55.947]  The Trends Journal, Trend Alerts, Trends in the News, Broadcast, etc.
[03:34:57.188 --> 03:35:03.132]  I've been talking about a self-sustaining economy now for the last 20 years.
[03:35:05.033 --> 03:35:07.775]  It's the only way we're going to rise to higher levels.
[03:35:08.775 --> 03:35:10.877]  Part of that is, of course, is Occupy Peace.
[03:35:11.617 --> 03:35:16.480]  Bring home all the troops, stop wasting our money rebuilding countries that we destroy.
[03:35:16.500 --> 03:35:18.322]  And 800 bases in over 80 countries
[03:35:21.730 --> 03:35:23.051]  And spend the money here.
[03:35:24.911 --> 03:35:28.213]  And one of the ways to spend the money is on new technology.
[03:35:28.813 --> 03:35:31.254]  We should have a new alternative energy by now.
[03:35:32.654 --> 03:35:34.395]  Electric cars aren't going to do it.
[03:35:34.415 --> 03:35:35.495]  They're using batteries.
[03:35:35.615 --> 03:35:37.696]  Batteries are an 1800s invention.
[03:35:38.877 --> 03:35:40.918]  You can only put so much energy into them.
[03:35:41.998 --> 03:35:46.220]  We need to redirect investments because we're going into the Greatest Depression.
[03:35:47.160 --> 03:35:49.621]  It's time to prepare to prevail and prosper.
[03:35:51.184 --> 03:36:03.373]  So when I talk about Trump bringing home the jobs here, they should have tariffs that they put back on before they let these countries and before they invented the World Trade Organization.
[03:36:04.334 --> 03:36:06.035]  It's only helping the rich people.
[03:36:07.256 --> 03:36:19.806]  Matter of fact, the headline story in today's Wall Street Journal front page was about how CEO's are getting much more than their
[03:36:20.336 --> 03:36:22.897]  Saying they're getting 16% more.
[03:36:24.638 --> 03:36:26.939]  So all the money is going to the 1%.
[03:36:28.560 --> 03:36:34.863]  We need to bring back jobs here that could help us earn livings and have living wages.
[03:36:35.783 --> 03:36:40.206]  And it's only going to happen by bringing manufacturing back, not service sector jobs.
[03:36:42.006 --> 03:36:44.668]  So we don't need China.
[03:36:45.288 --> 03:36:47.169]  The multinationals need them.
[03:36:47.856 --> 03:36:57.400]  The corporations that don't want to pay living wages to American workers, that want to use slave labor, they're the ones that need China.
[03:36:57.981 --> 03:37:00.162]  They're the ones that need Vietnam.
[03:37:00.602 --> 03:37:02.823]  They're the ones that need Bangladesh.
[03:37:03.563 --> 03:37:04.464]  We don't need them.
[03:37:06.385 --> 03:37:09.126]  All these liberals talk about, buy local.
[03:37:09.186 --> 03:37:10.586]  And I buy local all the time.
[03:37:10.626 --> 03:37:12.687]  We have a great farmer's market over here.
[03:37:13.508 --> 03:37:16.029]  And boy, I load up on fruit during the season.
[03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:18.250]  Try to stay healthy, eat a lot of it.
[03:37:19.651 --> 03:37:21.311]  Fresh corn, no GMOs.
[03:37:22.911 --> 03:37:23.551]  Buy local.
[03:37:24.152 --> 03:37:25.052]  Buy American.
[03:37:25.272 --> 03:37:26.192]  It's buying local.
[03:37:27.752 --> 03:37:28.892]  In Kingston over here.
[03:37:30.153 --> 03:37:32.853]  The Gantt Shirt Factory used to be here.
[03:37:33.073 --> 03:37:34.314]  This whole Hudson Valley.
[03:37:35.294 --> 03:37:38.874]  They were making stuff for every major company.
[03:37:40.255 --> 03:37:40.755]  Gone!
[03:37:41.795 --> 03:37:43.135]  Northern New York, poof!
[03:37:43.996 --> 03:37:44.756]  It's the Rust Belt.
[03:37:45.556 --> 03:37:46.336]  Beyond up here.
[03:37:47.534 --> 03:37:49.815]  Places like Auburn and Endicott.
[03:37:50.195 --> 03:37:50.755]  Endicott.
[03:37:51.755 --> 03:37:53.135]  Endicott Johnson.
[03:37:54.056 --> 03:37:55.476]  He was a shoe manufacturer.
[03:37:57.036 --> 03:37:57.977]  Used to make them there.
[03:37:59.517 --> 03:38:01.698]  Now they're making them in slave labor countries.
[03:38:03.238 --> 03:38:05.739]  Oh yeah, but the cost of everything's gonna go up.
[03:38:05.939 --> 03:38:07.739]  Oh yeah, we're gonna worry about that.
[03:38:08.279 --> 03:38:13.201]  Hey, if our wages go way up and the cost of everything goes up, that's fine with me.
[03:38:13.781 --> 03:38:14.561]  Fine with you too.
[03:38:15.714 --> 03:38:18.516]  The profits will go down for the multinationals.
[03:38:18.856 --> 03:38:20.897]  That's all they're concerned about.
[03:38:21.497 --> 03:38:23.198]  How much the CEOs get?
[03:38:27.701 --> 03:38:30.262]  How many stocks they could buy and drive the price up.
[03:38:30.802 --> 03:38:31.563]  End of story.
[03:38:31.943 --> 03:38:32.683]  Not helping us.
[03:38:34.384 --> 03:38:40.107]  So staying on that note, I totally support Trump on this issue.
[03:38:41.828 --> 03:38:42.949]  White House says Trump's
[03:38:43.422 --> 03:38:46.603]  Only China regret is not raising tariffs higher.
[03:38:47.403 --> 03:38:49.623]  Well, I could agree with that one as well.
[03:38:52.324 --> 03:38:57.745]  Another story of interest over here, just to put things in a perspective.
[03:38:58.725 --> 03:39:02.005]  How they tout the lie.
[03:39:02.525 --> 03:39:05.766]  This is from today's Financial Times.
[03:39:07.126 --> 03:39:11.527]  Globalization not to blame for rise in inequality, says report.
[03:39:12.654 --> 03:39:17.535]  Globalization has stalled over the past decade, so do not be blamed for the rise in inequality.
[03:39:18.316 --> 03:39:28.098]  Seen since the financial crisis, new research by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's former chief economist said.
[03:39:28.959 --> 03:39:29.919]  Catherine Mann.
[03:39:30.799 --> 03:39:31.499]  Catherine Mann?
[03:39:31.879 --> 03:39:32.720]  She transgender?
[03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:33.580]  Catherine and Mann?
[03:39:33.640 --> 03:39:34.560]  All right, take it easy.
[03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:40.382]  Now global chief economist at Citi said her research public.
[03:39:40.882 --> 03:39:41.302]  All right.
[03:39:42.532 --> 03:39:44.493]  Chief Economist for Citi.
[03:39:45.413 --> 03:39:47.594]  OECD Economist.
[03:39:48.054 --> 03:39:50.676]  You think you're going to get a straight line from them?
[03:39:51.916 --> 03:39:56.338]  All globalization has done is to help the multinationals.
[03:39:56.898 --> 03:39:58.299]  Nobody else.
[03:39:58.959 --> 03:40:07.643]  And that's all we are, are plantation workers on the multinational plantations of Slavelandia.
[03:40:08.564 --> 03:40:09.524]  Name the country.
[03:40:10.179 --> 03:40:11.860]  They call it populist movements.
[03:40:11.900 --> 03:40:13.200]  Not populist movements.
[03:40:13.660 --> 03:40:16.042]  People want to maintain their identity.
[03:40:16.682 --> 03:40:18.703]  The Italians want to be Italians.
[03:40:18.783 --> 03:40:21.404]  The Hungarians want to be Hungarians.
[03:40:22.464 --> 03:40:23.985]  The Germans want to be Germans.
[03:40:24.045 --> 03:40:25.305]  The French want to be French.
[03:40:26.646 --> 03:40:28.187]  The Polish want to be Polish.
[03:40:28.247 --> 03:40:29.427]  The Czechs want to be Czechs.
[03:40:31.828 --> 03:40:32.869]  What's wrong with that?
[03:40:33.749 --> 03:40:37.891]  What's wrong with appreciating your heritage?
[03:40:38.891 --> 03:40:40.392]  And not wanting it diluted.
[03:40:44.175 --> 03:40:47.497]  What we're going to see right now when this greatest depression hits.
[03:40:48.638 --> 03:40:51.019]  One of our top trends is human waves.
[03:40:52.801 --> 03:40:53.621]  Floods of people.
[03:40:53.661 --> 03:40:54.982]  That's one of our top trends for 2019.
[03:40:56.844 --> 03:40:57.924]  Leaving their nations.
[03:40:59.425 --> 03:41:01.387]  Looking for safety.
[03:41:02.988 --> 03:41:04.369]  Getting away from corruption.
[03:41:05.209 --> 03:41:05.790]  And crime.
[03:41:06.790 --> 03:41:07.551]  And out of poverty.
[03:41:09.121 --> 03:41:15.205]  When the greatest depression hits, we're going to see a tsunami, not a wave.
[03:41:16.946 --> 03:41:19.047]  Story in today's Financial Times.
[03:41:20.488 --> 03:41:24.951]  Ecuador tightens entry rules as Venezuela exodus intensifies.
[03:41:27.953 --> 03:41:30.094]  Again, I said I agree with Trump.
[03:41:30.174 --> 03:41:32.796]  I'm totally opposed to what he's doing in Venezuela.
[03:41:33.496 --> 03:41:34.837]  Totally opposed.
[03:41:35.523 --> 03:41:40.307]  And that little clown Bolton, our National Security Advisor, he's not my National Security Advisor.
[03:41:40.807 --> 03:41:42.368]  He can't advise me on anything.
[03:41:43.469 --> 03:41:50.854]  He's made it clear, we put the quote in the Trends Journal, American oil companies should be in Venezuela, it would be good for the American people.
[03:41:52.756 --> 03:41:53.777]  That's disgusting.
[03:41:53.797 --> 03:41:58.340]  That's conquering another nation who's sitting on the world's largest oil reserves.
[03:41:59.261 --> 03:42:05.065]  I'm making this point because Ecuador, you know the flood of people leaving Ecuador to come to America already?
[03:42:06.337 --> 03:42:15.100]  Guatemala, Honduras, Nigeria, excuse me, Nigeria, Nicaragua, Mexico.
[03:42:16.220 --> 03:42:18.061]  They're flooding out to come here already.
[03:42:19.021 --> 03:42:21.122]  What's going to happen when the greatest depression hits?
[03:42:23.243 --> 03:42:25.984]  By the way, they just killed another reporter over there in Mexico.
[03:42:26.024 --> 03:42:26.664]  They wipe him out.
[03:42:28.765 --> 03:42:30.145]  Print anything that they don't like.
[03:42:30.165 --> 03:42:31.826]  You think censorship is bad here?
[03:42:32.366 --> 03:42:33.126]  Yeah, death ship.
[03:42:34.019 --> 03:42:36.762]  That's the one you get on if you're a reporter in Mexico.
[03:42:37.142 --> 03:42:38.123]  The death ship.
[03:42:39.465 --> 03:42:41.707]  So, be staying with us.
[03:42:42.488 --> 03:42:44.410]  Prepare for the greatest depression.
[03:42:45.171 --> 03:42:45.631]  It's coming.
[03:42:46.853 --> 03:42:50.176]  Markets, they've peaked as I see them.
[03:42:50.917 --> 03:42:51.517]  Up a little more.
[03:42:51.537 --> 03:42:55.802]  Downward trajectory.
[03:42:55.822 --> 03:42:56.583]  Be back in a few.
[03:43:03.755 --> 03:43:10.781]  The power structure started out with Nazis and other unsavory groups that banned them first to set the precedent.
[03:43:11.922 --> 03:43:20.409]  But now they've moved on to popular populist, like the Yellow Vest Movement, like Tommy Robinson, like Gavin McGinnis, like Laura Loomer.
[03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:23.952]  The whole spectrum of people that are independent and are effective.
[03:43:24.633 --> 03:43:27.936]  There's an attempt to shut that down because they want to control the narrative.
[03:43:29.085 --> 03:43:45.132]  And if that is successful and continuing, it's really a giant electronic iron curtain that Churchill talked about 70 years ago, dropping down across the entire planet, and it's only going to intensify.
[03:43:45.212 --> 03:43:48.234]  So this is a desperate gamble.
[03:43:49.281 --> 03:43:52.683]  Or gambit that's being played by the establishment.
[03:43:52.923 --> 03:43:54.203]  And I don't think it's going to be successful.
[03:43:54.764 --> 03:44:06.049]  I believe in the people, but to have the establishment misrepresent who you are, create a straw man that ban you and then take you down, I don't see that as a position of strength.
[03:44:06.109 --> 03:44:08.710]  I see that as a real position of weakness.
[03:44:08.930 --> 03:44:10.951]  And I think it's going to backfire.
[03:44:11.712 --> 03:44:14.073]  Because most people don't do this one time.
[03:44:17.842 --> 03:44:20.524]  In the final equation, I'm in full wars.
[03:44:20.544 --> 03:44:28.590]  And what I've done is already, we have changed the course of human destiny in a big way.
[03:44:28.810 --> 03:44:34.194]  And so if I did one of those things in my life, I would feel fulfilled.
[03:44:34.814 --> 03:44:37.196]  Like I had really done what I was supposed to.
[03:44:38.237 --> 03:44:39.938]  So I intend to continue on.
[03:44:40.698 --> 03:44:42.159]  I continue to try to change the world.
[03:44:42.940 --> 03:44:47.223]  But my dream is to be able to stop what I'm doing.
[03:44:49.175 --> 03:44:51.539]  In the next five years or so.
[03:44:52.660 --> 03:44:54.163]  Because you can't do this forever.
[03:44:54.183 --> 03:44:59.210]  And politically I've hit the zeitgeist four times.
[03:45:00.412 --> 03:45:03.076]  Four times we've already changed the course of the planet.
[03:45:04.085 --> 03:45:08.028]  And I think it's almost bad luck to go for a fifth or a sixth time.
[03:45:08.789 --> 03:45:11.131]  So, it's not that I don't want to fight.
[03:45:11.311 --> 03:45:11.971]  I want to fight.
[03:45:12.051 --> 03:45:19.377]  But it's almost boorish or greedy or pig-like to continue to think that you're supposed to.
[03:45:19.397 --> 03:45:21.739]  Because most people don't do this one time.
[03:45:23.400 --> 03:45:24.661]  Well, four times.
[03:45:26.162 --> 03:45:26.723]  Four times.
[03:45:28.104 --> 03:45:32.107]  We have changed the course of human destiny in a big way.
[03:45:34.762 --> 03:45:45.691]  I just want the fifth time to warn everybody about the tyranny and the censorship and see humanity respond and then step back and fade into shadows.
[03:45:45.771 --> 03:45:46.672]  That's really my goal.
[03:45:47.573 --> 03:45:50.155]  But I got a sneaking suspicion that that's not going to happen.
[03:45:50.996 --> 03:45:55.799]  And I think I'm probably going to change paradigms 10 times, 20 times.
[03:45:56.660 --> 03:45:58.782]  So nobody else will do it.
[03:45:59.262 --> 03:45:59.803]  So I got to do it.
[03:46:05.953 --> 03:46:08.576]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[03:46:09.396 --> 03:46:12.559]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:12.579 --> 03:46:14.441]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:14.461 --> 03:46:19.226]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[03:46:22.169 --> 03:46:25.072]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[03:46:25.232 --> 03:46:26.353]  It's a form of fascism.
[03:46:27.458 --> 03:46:30.939]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[03:46:31.039 --> 03:46:37.760]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:46:42.361 --> 03:46:45.822]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[03:46:53.984 --> 03:46:55.204]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:57.930 --> 03:46:58.951]  You can't watch this.
[03:46:59.291 --> 03:47:02.673]  The movie available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:47:06.035 --> 03:47:08.676]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.506 --> 03:47:24.547]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:24.927 --> 03:47:27.108]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:47:27.608 --> 03:47:30.829]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.909 --> 03:47:35.951]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.971 --> 03:47:40.773]  And then remember, put your money where your heart is and support InfoWars.
[03:47:40.813 --> 03:47:46.976]  Do what you can because they're introducing the new super silver skin cream.

[03:47:59.865 --> 03:48:05.166]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[03:48:05.246 --> 03:48:06.887]  It helps reduce wrinkles.
[03:48:06.947 --> 03:48:08.247]  I got to get some of that stuff, man.
[03:48:08.267 --> 03:48:09.947]  I got some wrinkles on my head over here.
[03:48:10.968 --> 03:48:13.128]  And keep your skin healthy.
[03:48:14.215 --> 03:48:17.678]  It kills the dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[03:48:18.419 --> 03:48:32.371]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Soul technology that's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.
[03:48:32.451 --> 03:48:39.097]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin like coconut oil and vitamin A.
[03:48:39.966 --> 03:48:49.589]  Unlike most skin cream, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA, parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfites.
[03:48:50.349 --> 03:48:51.089]  So there you got it.
[03:48:52.030 --> 03:48:59.952]  Go to InfoWars, get 25% off the introductory price, InfoWarsStores.com for your silver skin cream.
[03:49:00.412 --> 03:49:04.113]  And I'm going to go get some myself, because I've got to get rid of some of these wrinkles here.
[03:49:05.014 --> 03:49:08.095]  So I was talking about Ecuador.
[03:49:09.704 --> 03:49:11.906]  Big story in the Financial Times today.
[03:49:12.786 --> 03:49:16.610]  Ecuador tightens entry rules as Venezuela exodus intensifies.
[03:49:17.470 --> 03:49:25.176]  Now, how come they're not condemning Venezuela for not wanting any more people come in?
[03:49:25.717 --> 03:49:36.065]  But hey, when Americans like myself say we don't need any more people coming in, well then I'm, you know, I'm racist or some other stupid comment.
[03:49:36.625 --> 03:49:38.367]  But nobody's going after Venezuela.
[03:49:39.966 --> 03:49:41.607]  Because Venezuela is Venezuela.
[03:49:41.967 --> 03:49:42.808]  Excuse me, Ecuador.
[03:49:43.569 --> 03:49:49.172]  Ecuador could do what they like, even though they're sending people here like crazy because they want to get away from the poverty, the corruption, the crime.
[03:49:50.813 --> 03:49:56.177]  But it's okay for Ecuador and other countries to close borders, but not the United States.
[03:49:56.838 --> 03:49:59.359]  And by the way, when people say, well, you know, we're all immigrants.
[03:49:59.399 --> 03:50:00.100]  Yes, we are.
[03:50:01.661 --> 03:50:03.582]  And they brought us here because they needed workers.
[03:50:04.743 --> 03:50:05.584]  End of story.
[03:50:06.524 --> 03:50:09.106]  There's a Napolitano, what they call a Southern Italian.
[03:50:09.738 --> 03:50:11.319]  They didn't like us over here.
[03:50:13.101 --> 03:50:15.362]  You go back and you look at the records.
[03:50:15.643 --> 03:50:18.245]  They didn't want, the Northern Italians were okay.
[03:50:18.265 --> 03:50:20.086]  They didn't want the Southern Italians to come here.
[03:50:21.787 --> 03:50:23.969]  They brought us here because they needed labor.
[03:50:24.690 --> 03:50:28.873]  And the Southern Italians had a lot of skills, particularly in masonry.
[03:50:30.214 --> 03:50:36.379]  Matter of fact, up here in Kingston, the brickyards up and down the Hudson River, Glasgow, north of here,
[03:50:37.492 --> 03:50:40.333]  More Italians in Ulster County than any other nationality.
[03:50:41.414 --> 03:50:42.714]  They weren't treated very well.
[03:50:53.759 --> 03:50:54.939]  Needed workers.
[03:50:56.460 --> 03:50:57.961]  We don't need workers anymore.
[03:50:59.001 --> 03:51:00.102]  We got more than we need.
[03:51:01.802 --> 03:51:03.583]  When I talk about the Greatest Depression,
[03:51:05.560 --> 03:51:08.401]  And the human waves turning into a tsunami.
[03:51:13.002 --> 03:51:20.204]  When the economy slows down, there's going to be more people in jobs by a long shot.
[03:51:21.464 --> 03:51:25.805]  I'm not good at math, but figure this one out.
[03:51:25.825 --> 03:51:27.605]  1930, Great Depression hits, right?
[03:51:29.406 --> 03:51:30.766]  How many people are on the planet?
[03:51:33.247 --> 03:51:33.927]  Two billion.
[03:51:34.898 --> 03:51:46.783]  Two billion, less than a hundred years later, we've added, now we're at 7.5 billion.
[03:51:47.723 --> 03:51:51.225]  From two billion, we've added 5.5 billion.
[03:51:54.246 --> 03:51:59.948]  Africa, we're at a report to having about seven children per family.
[03:52:00.669 --> 03:52:01.649]  We can't take care of one.
[03:52:03.957 --> 03:52:06.619]  Floods of people coming out of Africa into Europe.
[03:52:07.240 --> 03:52:13.364]  By the way, they weren't doing that before the murderer Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[03:52:13.844 --> 03:52:15.366]  I don't like that guy Kadhafi.
[03:52:15.526 --> 03:52:17.287]  I want him out of there, alright?
[03:52:17.347 --> 03:52:18.368]  I want him out of there.
[03:52:18.708 --> 03:52:26.914]  I don't care who you kill, I don't care what you destroy, even though it's the richest country in Africa, and they treat people better than anywhere else, they give them a lot of benefits.
[03:52:27.294 --> 03:52:28.375]  I don't like the guy.
[03:52:28.395 --> 03:52:29.516]  I want him out of there.
[03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:38.796]  And before they got him out of there, Gaddafi warned Europe, you get me out here, you're going to have a flood of people coming in through Libya into Europe.
[03:52:38.836 --> 03:52:39.997]  You're not going to be able to stop.
[03:52:40.858 --> 03:52:41.558]  And it was the truth.
[03:52:41.578 --> 03:52:42.859]  And that's exactly what happened.
[03:52:44.120 --> 03:52:49.064]  Months after he was killed, over 500,000 people migrated to Europe.
[03:52:50.325 --> 03:52:56.990]  Now, with the greatest depression coming, you're going to see a tsunami of people looking for jobs.
[03:52:59.110 --> 03:53:00.010]  Climate change?
[03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:02.591]  I call it planet destruction.
[03:53:02.611 --> 03:53:03.931]  I don't know if there's climate change.
[03:53:04.471 --> 03:53:05.971]  They're poisoning us in every way.
[03:53:05.991 --> 03:53:14.573]  I mean, the products that I'm talking about to buy from InfoWars, they're talking about health, not having all these phony ingredients in it.
[03:53:16.633 --> 03:53:20.774]  They're poisoning our food, they're poisoning the air, they're poisoning the water.
[03:53:21.494 --> 03:53:22.074]  Fracking?
[03:53:22.094 --> 03:53:22.934]  Yeah, frack you.
[03:53:24.154 --> 03:53:27.955]  Oh, we can't tell you what chemicals we're pumping into the... because we don't want people to steal our...
[03:53:29.447 --> 03:53:33.070]  Our invention to bring up the water.
[03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:35.151]  That's only one of them.
[03:53:35.511 --> 03:53:37.413]  Oh, over here in Jersey?
[03:53:38.173 --> 03:53:38.914]  Oh, that Booker.
[03:53:38.994 --> 03:53:40.255]  Yeah, Booker the Crooker.
[03:53:40.855 --> 03:53:42.056]  The guy running for president?
[03:53:43.157 --> 03:53:50.562]  Oh, yeah, they got lead in the pipes in the water over there, which they knew about for a long time and been covering it up.
[03:53:51.723 --> 03:53:52.243]  So when I say
[03:53:53.086 --> 03:53:54.186]  Planet destruction?
[03:53:54.206 --> 03:53:55.567]  You're worried about climate change?
[03:53:55.587 --> 03:53:58.208]  You're going to be dead by the time climate changes, man.
[03:53:58.488 --> 03:53:59.108]  Ain't we, man?
[03:53:59.668 --> 03:54:01.689]  Because they're killing us on so many different levels.
[03:54:01.749 --> 03:54:09.672]  That's why you need, if you want to stay healthy, wealthy and wise, to consider buying some products from InfoWars that will improve your health.
[03:54:12.573 --> 03:54:15.875]  So, going back to where it's going with human waves.
[03:54:16.955 --> 03:54:19.556]  Too many people, not enough jobs.
[03:54:21.237 --> 03:54:22.497]  That's why we have no inflation.
[03:54:23.638 --> 03:54:25.239]  Or relatively low inflation.
[03:54:25.859 --> 03:54:29.540]  When you put in the real factors, it's much higher, but the government numbers.
[03:54:31.041 --> 03:54:39.164]  And the government numbers, I'm facing, is low because you don't have to pay people a lot to work in Slavelandia, where the multinationals own everything.
[03:54:41.064 --> 03:54:43.865]  Online, you get it done cheaper, my five Os.
[03:54:45.086 --> 03:54:49.327]  Online, open markets, China, we don't need China.
[03:54:49.687 --> 03:54:51.108]  China's keeping down the prices.
[03:54:51.872 --> 03:54:53.593]  Bangladesh, keeping down the prices.
[03:54:53.813 --> 03:54:57.475]  Online, open markets, overcapacity.
[03:54:58.676 --> 03:55:00.476]  There's more capacity to make what you need.
[03:55:01.397 --> 03:55:02.658]  You name it, all around the world.
[03:55:04.539 --> 03:55:06.820]  Keeps prices down because we have overproduction.
[03:55:07.260 --> 03:55:08.941]  More stuff than you can buy.
[03:55:10.482 --> 03:55:18.566]  That's why places like the dollar stores and the TJ Maxx's and the home goods selling stuff that they couldn't sell for full price are doing well.
[03:55:20.387 --> 03:55:20.847]  Online,
[03:55:21.388 --> 03:55:29.250]  Open markets, overcapacity, overproduction, and overpopulation!
[03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:32.271]  Again, $2 billion in 1930, $7.5 billion in 2019, $10 billion by 2050.
[03:55:32.331 --> 03:55:35.411]  That's why you don't have inflation.
[03:55:35.431 --> 03:55:36.972]  You have more slave labor
[03:55:51.718 --> 03:55:52.719]  And they could ever want.
[03:55:53.339 --> 03:55:54.180]  Reparations?
[03:55:55.441 --> 03:56:03.287]  This is... The multinational plantations owners got it better than the plantation owners had it.
[03:56:04.208 --> 03:56:08.351]  Because the plantation owners were housing and feeding the slaves.
[03:56:08.971 --> 03:56:12.314]  Treating them terribly, of course, but having to house and feed them.
[03:56:13.915 --> 03:56:17.658]  The multinational plantation owners, they figured it out better.
[03:56:18.399 --> 03:56:19.640]  We'll give them just enough money
[03:56:21.152 --> 03:56:22.793]  So they keep coming back to work.
[03:56:23.354 --> 03:56:25.275]  They can live in their cars or live on the streets.
[03:56:25.315 --> 03:56:25.856]  We don't care.
[03:56:25.876 --> 03:56:29.879]  They're slaves on a multinational plantation.
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:33.922]  So that's why you're not seeing inflation going up.
[03:56:34.502 --> 03:56:38.065]  But I'm warning you, the greatest depression is on the near horizon.
[03:56:39.346 --> 03:56:41.708]  My forecast is that it's going to hit by 2021.
[03:56:41.988 --> 03:56:49.874]  The central banks are going to do everything they can to prop up the economy around the world.
[03:56:51.434 --> 03:56:56.075]  Trump is going to keep dumping more pressure on Powell to lower interest rates.
[03:56:57.316 --> 03:56:59.576]  But they don't have a lot of room to lower them.
[03:57:01.237 --> 03:57:04.638]  Back when the last recession hit, they were at 5%, 5.5.
[03:57:05.838 --> 03:57:07.659]  Now they're at 2%.
[03:57:08.859 --> 03:57:09.639]  They only could go down 2%.
[03:57:10.259 --> 03:57:12.620]  They'll come up with another scheme.
[03:57:13.520 --> 03:57:17.862]  They'll push some more liquidity into the markets to help out the banksters.
[03:57:18.742 --> 03:57:19.402]  It's not going to work.
[03:57:22.199 --> 03:57:28.446]  And when I come back from the break, I'm going to talk about some very important issues that you need to know about.
[03:57:29.427 --> 03:57:35.374]  And... Or else they'll take you to war.
[03:57:36.816 --> 03:57:39.459]  Back in a minute.
[03:57:55.163 --> 03:57:59.193]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the Second American Revolution.
[03:58:00.578 --> 03:58:02.139]  You're changing world destiny.
[03:58:02.480 --> 03:58:06.623]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[03:58:07.123 --> 03:58:12.247]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[03:58:12.327 --> 03:58:18.692]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[03:58:18.772 --> 03:58:24.517]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[03:58:24.537 --> 03:58:26.999]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[03:58:27.179 --> 03:58:29.681]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[03:58:29.721 --> 03:58:32.624]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[03:58:32.784 --> 03:58:33.985]  It's totally fooled the model.
[03:58:34.266 --> 03:58:37.248]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[03:58:37.308 --> 03:58:43.894]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[03:58:44.075 --> 03:58:49.800]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[03:58:49.820 --> 03:58:52.202]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[03:58:52.362 --> 03:58:52.983]  This is not real.
[03:58:53.363 --> 03:58:59.613]  We went to one of the top firms in the world that private labels fish oil and krill oil and we said we want the best you make.
