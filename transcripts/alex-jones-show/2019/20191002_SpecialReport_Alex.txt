[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:01.250]  It's a whole hoax.
[00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.910]  And you know who's playing into the hoax?
[00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.632]  People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.
[00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:10.694]  And I say in many cases, the corrupt media, because you're corrupt.
[00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:14.376]  Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it's corrupt.
[00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:16.777]  And you have some very fine people, too.
[00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:19.058]  Great journalists, great reporters.
[00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:23.180]  But to a large extent, it's corrupt and it's fake.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.163]  President Trump's press conference today was riveting.
[00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:40.735]  Every reporter, whether they be from the United States or from overseas in Europe, would ask the most vicious questions.
[00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:49.298]  And they would say that if he even talks to a world leader and asks them to do something for America, that that's corrupt somehow.
[00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:51.859]  That representing your country is bad.
[00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:56.360]  And Trump just demolished the hoax.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.281]  And then a Reuters reporter
[00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:08.224]  said to the president, oh, you didn't really get this good trade ruling from the WTO?
[00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:19.809]  The WTO ruled today in favor of the United States, saying that the United States can now impose tariffs on European goods because of illegal subsidies against Airbus.
[00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.150]  That was a big win for the United States, right?
[00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.431]  You never had wins with other presidents, did you?
[00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.171]  But we're having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became president.
[00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:30.652]  This was a case that started, I think, 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:31.812]  Excuse me.
[00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:36.598]  Your wins are now because they think I don't like the WTO and they want to make sure I'm happy.
[00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.185]  Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years.
[00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:43.208]  They know that I'm wise to it.
[00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:44.250]  We've had a lot of wins.
[00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.693]  This was a 7 billion dollar win.
[00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:47.334]  Not bad.
[00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:55.917]  And Trump pointed out that he put the pressure on them, that he was unhappy, and that they did a favorable ruling on the EU because they've been screwing us over.
[00:01:56.317 --> 00:02:00.658]  That's what globalism is, is one-sided trade deals to de-industrialize the US.
[00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:08.660]  That's a globalist agreement with the EU and China, and operatives they put in charge of the US.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.221]  So to see a president taking the chains off of America,
[00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:15.569]  We're good to go.
[00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:45.497]  And they are just so scared right now that their long reign of selling off America to the highest bidder is over.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:58.604]  This is an incredible time and I don't know how anybody out there could say that they're bored or that they're not, you know, absolutely focused on what's happening and then hopefully politically and culturally and economically involved because this is a war.
[00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:02.145]  The left has misjudged and miscalculated Americans.
[00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:07.427]  They believe that we acquiesced to their tyranny before because we were intimidated.
[00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:10.188]  No, we were asleep.
[00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:14.055]  And now they keep intimidating more, more, more, more.
[00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:19.176]  They're threatening to kill the President, imprison him, put him in solitary confinement, and none of it's working.
[00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:20.536]  They're trying to destroy me.
[00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:22.016]  They're going after the President's family.
[00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:25.077]  They're going after all the libertarian internationalist press.
[00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:30.858]  They're now saying the NRA is a terrorist group and going after their members.
[00:03:31.658 --> 00:03:35.939]  That is not going to result in people submitting.
[00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.320]  It's going to result in people standing up in legal and lawful ways and taking action.
[00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:46.566]  And now the globalists and their controlled left realize that, so they're in panic mode.
[00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:53.548]  And they are now realizing that they just need to go ahead and crash the economy and go ahead and start a civil war.
[00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:56.408]  And hopefully they can get black people and white people killing each other.
[00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:05.571]  In all that chaos, Trump can be removed and we'll just continue with business as usual, shutting this nation and other once free nations down.
[00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:07.471]  I'm here to tell you that's not going to happen.
[00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:11.804]  I have seen our listeners come through like never before.
[00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.905]  Spreading the word, getting the videos out, the articles out.
[00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:19.067]  BandDot videos had over 20 million views in just the first month it was launched.
[00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:20.368]  That is amazing.
[00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:24.389]  So, all it is when this fight against the globalists.
[00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.390]  They're such horrible people.
[00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.110]  They're so bad.
[00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.051]  They're so psychotic.
[00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.572]  They've really institutionalized criminal activity.
[00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:37.085]  And they've launched it on a scale never seen, and every fiber of my body just wants to get them off our backs.
[00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:41.129]  And it doesn't mean like the communists or the fascists that we're offering some utopia.
[00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.778]  We're just trying to promote Americana, free market, family, self-defense, and just a, you know, good system based on what works.
[00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.922]  But the globalists have used our tolerance against us.
[00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:03.147]  We tolerate their corruption, we tolerate their manipulation, we tolerate their bullying, we tolerate their control freak behavior, and all it does is make them more power-mad.
[00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:06.170]  The time for tolerating is over.
[00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:12.957]  You know, the left still goes to Mitch McConnell's house and Rand Paul's all the time and Tucker Carlson's and gets in everybody's face.
[00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:18.503]  A lot of those folks have reportedly, you know, moved out of their neighborhoods, but their empty houses are still being attacked.
[00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:24.540]  The left comes over and spills iced tea on me or gets in my face, I get up and get in their face.
[00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.063]  They put their hands on me, I shove them up against the wall.
[00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:30.526]  And people have seen that, and that's only a fraction of the times it's happened.
[00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:35.351]  Let me tell you, now when I see the left in a restaurant on the street, they keep their mouths shut.
[00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:39.595]  Because when they get in my face, I'm not going to sit there and kiss their ass.
[00:05:39.835 --> 00:05:40.796]  They're not my god.
[00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:41.497]  They're not over me.
[00:05:45.316 --> 00:05:48.137]  They're not my God, they're not my daddy, and they're not my boss.
[00:05:48.477 --> 00:05:50.638]  Who was that fella who said that it went viral?
[00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.339]  And, you know, it's really true.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.141]  And we've had a lot of hospitality in America, especially in Texas.
[00:05:57.721 --> 00:06:03.604]  And that hospitality's been used by the left to get us to acquiesce to all their BS, and it's time for that to stop.
[00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:06.685]  And I gotta tell you, watching Trump in that press conference,
[00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:08.775]  Already seen some of the clips.
[00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:09.495]  We're going to play some more.
[00:06:09.996 --> 00:06:11.536]  It's just pure Americana.
[00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:14.637]  So we're going to post this report up on Bandot Video.
[00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:15.377]  I hope you'll share it.
[00:06:16.197 --> 00:06:22.479]  And we're also going to post the full press conference up and a lot of other things like Hillary.
[00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.080]  There was a video with 50 million views showing all her lies.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.261]  YouTube shadow banned that.
[00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:29.581]  So we grabbed it and put it up.
[00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:34.763]  I mean, bottom line, we're innovating, we're fighting back, and it's exciting.
[00:06:35.947 --> 00:06:43.189]  But the globalists are making their moves, so I just cannot stress to you enough how important it is, you realize, what a special time it is, and that there's not just evil in the universe, there's good as well.
[00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:51.772]  But to see Trump unapologetic and in their faces, and to see so many Americans taking action, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:06:52.092 --> 00:07:00.715]  You know, Owen Schroyer went out today, he paid for, with his own money as usual, a big banner that said, Impeach Trump.
[00:07:02.042 --> 00:07:06.184]  And he did it kind of like a change my mind with Steven Crowder.
[00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:17.769]  And 99% of the people, hundreds that came by, shook his hand and said, we appreciate you, we appreciate President Trump in so-called deep blue Austin, Texas.
[00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.811]  He had two people say, F you.
[00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:25.172]  F Trump.
[00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:27.713]  And that's what I find, because I'm a public figure.
[00:07:27.873 --> 00:07:28.693]  People know who I am.
[00:07:30.657 --> 00:07:33.298]  In the last three years, it's maybe one out of a hundred people.
[00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:39.001]  I shake like a hundred hands or more before somebody says, F you, Russian agent, all that stuff.
[00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:41.562]  But here's the missing link.
[00:07:43.142 --> 00:07:44.323]  And I say this because it's so critical.
[00:07:44.983 --> 00:07:54.747]  We don't even have the crew to send Owen down with a camera on the street because the rest of the crew was busy going through reports and uploading videos.
[00:07:56.988 --> 00:07:58.229]  And there I was watching him on
[00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:04.940]  Twitter has incredible footage, as good as the stuff Steven Crowder does, and I'm like thinking, man, this guy deserves a camera crew.
[00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:05.561]  So...
[00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:10.167]  Again, that's why your financial support is so incredibly critical.
[00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:24.059]  It's why when you buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com, it allows all this to happen because the globalists and their Tricom funders know that you used InfoWars as a focal point to spread the word to cause a chain reaction that got Trump into office.
[00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:26.561]  We're definitely credited with pushing him over the top.
[00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:27.422]  That means you're credited.
[00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:31.065]  So they want to get rid of this gathering place, this launchpad of truth.
[00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:33.256]  And so again, I'll say it.
[00:08:33.636 --> 00:08:35.077]  Spread the word about Band.Video.
[00:08:35.257 --> 00:08:37.759]  Infowars.com is blacklisted on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:40.200]  You can get sanctioned for spreading it.
[00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:41.661]  So it's not effective to do that.
[00:08:42.262 --> 00:08:43.963]  But Band.Video isn't blacklisted yet.
[00:08:44.263 --> 00:08:46.365]  Summit.News with Paul Watson isn't blacklisted yet.
[00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:48.026]  And all these other great sites.
[00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:49.027]  Start your own site.
[00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:50.087]  Mirror our material.
[00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:50.928]  It's copyright free.
[00:08:51.108 --> 00:08:51.949]  Just get it out.
[00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:55.111]  Because they don't want it to get out because it's effective.
[00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:55.931]  That's the good news.
[00:08:56.532 --> 00:08:57.973]  They wouldn't have done all this.
[00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:07.907]  And gone through all this trouble and lost, last count, 500 plus billion dollars the last year of Silicon Valley with their censorship.
[00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:10.011]  Because it makes their whole outlook very, very bad.
[00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:11.453]  Tyranny doesn't sell.
[00:09:12.895 --> 00:09:18.417]  But you see, they're just puppets themselves for larger, more powerful institutions that want total control.
[00:09:18.697 --> 00:09:21.538]  It's about power, like Buddha Judge just said today.
[00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:23.959]  We're taking the guns, it's about power.
[00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:28.420]  Mao Zedong, 70 years ago, said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.081]  He said that when he took over China, by force.
[00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:33.642]  Well, we don't have guns to take over by force.
[00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:37.403]  We have guns as an emergency backup, as free humans, to say,
[00:09:38.237 --> 00:09:40.298]  You're not going to take our guns from our cold dead hands.
[00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.340]  So we can beat this thing peacefully.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.302]  They're going to overturn the chessboard because they know they're losing.
[00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:56.346]  And that's why this is a time to be focused, to be praying, to be engaged, to be involved, and to have your voice heard however you can.
[00:09:56.966 --> 00:10:01.168]  Because this truly is an information war and there's a war on for our minds.
[00:10:01.489 --> 00:10:01.849]  So again,
[00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.086]  Thank you for all you've done.
[00:10:05.006 --> 00:10:07.447]  There's no words to say how epic this time in history is.
[00:10:07.687 --> 00:10:12.568]  So just realize that, and realize how crucial you are, and how we're all in the arena.
[00:10:12.828 --> 00:10:16.829]  And please share this boil-down of the President's amazing press conference.
[00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:24.491]  May we all get courage to carry on and fight harder from it, and then hopefully get the full press conference from Band-Odd Video to share that as well.
[00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:26.992]  Because again, you are the dark.
[00:10:29.377 --> 00:10:34.541]  Because again, the only way we move the ball down the field is you, and you've been doing it.
[00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:38.624]  So I have faith for my children and our future.
[00:10:38.664 --> 00:10:39.685]  I know you have faith as well.
[00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:40.786]  That's why you're here.
[00:10:40.986 --> 00:10:43.028]  We're not a bunch of victims just bitching and complaining.
[00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:46.991]  We're exposing what's bad to take action to protect what's good.
[00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:47.771]  Thank you, sir.
[00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:49.393]  What about Mr. Biden?
[00:10:49.453 --> 00:10:50.654]  What did you want about Biden?
[00:10:50.694 --> 00:10:51.995]  What did you want him to look into on Biden?
[00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:54.296]  Look, Biden and his son.
[00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.691]  Well, it sounds like it might be a good question.
[00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:00.791]  Let me see if I like the question.
[00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:01.052]  Go ahead.
[00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:05.733]  Maybe for the first time in three years I'll have a good question, and I'll love it.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.662]  That the whistleblower met with a staff member of Adam Schiff prior to the complaint being filed.
[00:11:22.722 --> 00:11:23.443]  Oh, I love that question.
[00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.283]  It shows that Schiff is a fraud.
[00:11:25.524 --> 00:11:27.124]  I love that question.
[00:11:27.224 --> 00:11:27.945]  Thank you, John.
[00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:29.265]  So, can I finish asking it?
[00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:31.066]  Yes, there's nothing to finish.
[00:11:31.686 --> 00:11:37.229]  So, the whistleblower, according to this report, met with a member of Adam Schiff's staff.
[00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:38.230]  You've got it right there.
[00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:38.890]  You know it.
[00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.630]  I hate to say it's the New York Times, I can't believe they wrote it.
[00:11:42.051 --> 00:11:43.991]  Maybe they're getting better.
[00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:50.092]  Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the complaint?
[00:11:50.112 --> 00:11:52.713]  Well, I think it's a scandal that he knew before.
[00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:53.833]  I'd go a step further.
[00:11:53.853 --> 00:11:55.253]  I think he probably helped write it.
[00:11:56.113 --> 00:11:56.433]  Okay?
[00:11:56.493 --> 00:11:57.353]  That's what the word is.
[00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:02.194]  And I think it's... I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.
[00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:04.735]  Just happened as I'm walking up here, they handed it to me.
[00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:08.573]  And I said to Mike, I said, whoa, that's something.
[00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:09.354]  That's big stuff.
[00:12:09.974 --> 00:12:10.955]  That's a big story.
[00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:14.076]  He knew long before, and he helped write it, too.
[00:12:14.876 --> 00:12:15.557]  It's a scam.
[00:12:16.117 --> 00:12:16.717]  It's a scam.
[00:12:17.338 --> 00:12:19.359]  Just to finish on this, I appreciate it.
[00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:21.239]  I love that second question, by the way.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.000]  This gentleman, a question.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.781]  Don't be rude.
[00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:25.221]  No, sir, I don't want to be rude.
[00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.723]  I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you.
[00:12:27.743 --> 00:12:28.543]  I've answered everything.
[00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:32.119]  It's a whole hoax, and you know who's playing into the hoax?
[00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:35.862]  People like you, and the fake news media that we have in this country.
[00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:39.925]  And I say, in many cases, the corrupt media, because you're corrupt.
[00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:43.607]  Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it's corrupt.
[00:12:44.108 --> 00:12:45.989]  And you have some very fine people, too.
[00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:52.414]  Great journalists, great reporters, but to a large extent, it's corrupt and it's fake.
[00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:54.515]  The whole thing is a scam.
[00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:57.450]  The Mueller deal was a scam.
[00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:00.753]  The Russian collusion was a scam.
[00:13:01.353 --> 00:13:02.334]  You can ask Putin.
[00:13:02.814 --> 00:13:05.736]  Nobody's been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
[00:13:06.297 --> 00:13:06.597]  Okay?
[00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:09.399]  Now, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia.
[00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.000]  And we will get along with Russia, because it's smart.
[00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.923]  But nobody's been tougher on Russia
[00:13:15.723 --> 00:13:16.543]  Then Donald Trump.
[00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:16.884]  Okay.
[00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:17.924]  Ask one, please.
[00:13:17.944 --> 00:13:19.104]  Thank you very much.
[00:13:19.144 --> 00:13:19.445]  Please.
[00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:27.688]  Mr. President, can you just make clear right here, what do you or what did you want President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?
[00:13:29.489 --> 00:13:32.270]  If you look at what he said, okay?
[00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.651]  And he brought it up.
[00:13:33.711 --> 00:13:35.771]  I think he brought up the name Rudy Giuliani.
[00:13:36.772 --> 00:13:38.313]  What I want is the following.
[00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:39.993]  And I've said this loud and clear.
[00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:42.054]  We have our ambassadors here.
[00:13:42.114 --> 00:13:43.855]  We have Mike Pence here.
[00:13:44.989 --> 00:13:50.451]  Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine?
[00:13:51.472 --> 00:13:52.972]  We give money to Ukraine.
[00:13:53.793 --> 00:13:55.774]  And it's bothered me from day one.
[00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.274]  And you have plenty of people just here.
[00:13:58.155 --> 00:14:00.816]  I say, how come it's always the United States that gets ripped?
[00:14:01.896 --> 00:14:04.237]  Frankly, Ukraine, we want to help them.
[00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:05.918]  And I do like the new president.
[00:14:05.938 --> 00:14:06.618]  You know why I like him?
[00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:07.398]  Because he was honest.
[00:14:07.438 --> 00:14:10.840]  Because he said there was no pressure at all exerted on me.
[00:14:12.008 --> 00:14:12.508]  Meaning him.
[00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:14.630]  By the President of the United States.
[00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.130]  He said it.
[00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.231]  By the way, that one sentence should stop this.
[00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:20.133]  But he said there was no pressure exerted.
[00:14:20.533 --> 00:14:21.654]  But you don't have to ask him.
[00:14:21.754 --> 00:14:23.295]  All you have to do is read the transcript.
[00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:24.636]  Read the telephone call.
[00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.998]  But what I was having a problem with are two things.
[00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:33.561]  Number one, Ukraine is known, before him, for tremendous corruption.
[00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:34.742]  Tremendous.
[00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.163]  More than just about any country in the world.
[00:14:38.164 --> 00:14:41.586]  In fact, they're rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
[00:14:42.642 --> 00:14:49.348]  And I don't like giving money to a country that's that corrupt.
[00:14:49.368 --> 00:15:00.777]  Number two, I said the following, and I said this loud and clear to everybody, and in fact Rob Portman backed me up, and there's nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio.
[00:15:01.858 --> 00:15:03.739]  Because he called up, please let the money go.
[00:15:05.606 --> 00:15:13.211]  I hate being the country that's always giving money when Ukraine helps Europe and the European countries far more than they help us.
[00:15:13.972 --> 00:15:16.373]  They're like a wall between Russia and Europe.
[00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:17.214]  They're like a wall.
[00:15:17.274 --> 00:15:19.956]  They're a big, wide, beautiful wall.
[00:15:21.192 --> 00:15:23.154]  And he said, you know what, but it's important.
[00:15:23.794 --> 00:15:25.235]  In fact, he came out and he said that.
[00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:26.316]  That was my only reason.
[00:15:26.917 --> 00:15:29.018]  Because I don't like being the sucker country.
[00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:31.440]  We were the sucker country for years and years.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.982]  We're not the sucker country anymore.
[00:15:33.662 --> 00:15:37.185]  But I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked.
[00:15:37.886 --> 00:15:39.327]  But I don't like to be the sucker.
[00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:42.229]  And European countries are helped far more than we are.
[00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.272]  And those countries should pay more to help Ukraine.
[00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:51.666]  And please remember the President's last remarks, that we are a great democracy.
[00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:55.349]  We are a great, the United States is a great democracy.
[00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.994]  And I'm airing what I'm airing because we are in fact a democracy.
[00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:12.285]  And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.
[00:16:14.187 --> 00:16:19.191]  We would be a far greater when we don't have the CNNs of the world who are corrupt people.
[00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:20.412]  Thank you very much everybody.
[00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:40.914]  You're down here thinking you can tame Texas and conquer us and destroy us like California.
[00:16:41.214 --> 00:16:44.596]  You think you can turn us into your disarmed slaves?
[00:16:45.396 --> 00:16:49.679]  Beto O'Rourke, you're well known for fantasizing and writing essays about murdering children.
[00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:52.900]  And you even got away with a hit and run and burglary.
[00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.082]  You're a dirty criminal.
[00:16:55.522 --> 00:16:59.244]  You've got your own bodyguards because you're hooked into that billionaire wife of yours.
[00:16:59.704 --> 00:17:02.166]  How dare you try to demonize American gun owners?
[00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:07.207]  Just in case you didn't know, this country was founded when the Redcoats came to take the guns in 1775.
[00:17:07.507 --> 00:17:09.388]  That's why we got July 4th.
[00:17:09.448 --> 00:17:14.709]  So I'm going to tell you what George Washington and the Continental Congress told King George III.
[00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.930]  You're not getting our firearms because we're free men, you little piece of crap!
[00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:25.572]  America and the world's glad, though, that you finally got the guts to admit your plan with the rest of those scumbag Democrats.
[00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:28.052]  Beto O'Rourke, you're on notice!
[00:17:28.472 --> 00:17:31.013]  You're not getting our firearms, ever, scumbag!
