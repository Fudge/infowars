[00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.711]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.635]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.228 --> 00:00:46.849]  Why do I have a case of bottled water here?
[00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.670]  I'll tell you about that after the break.
[00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.111]  And I'm going to tell you the most important information you've ever heard in your life.
[00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:56.111]  And that's not hype.
[00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:59.292]  It is the most important information on the planet.
[00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:01.592]  And we will break it all on the other side.
[00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:02.713]  But first, a key report.
[00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:06.934]  America's streets are mental institutions, and it's because of this.
[00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:07.814]  Right here.
[00:01:08.857 --> 00:01:10.979]  It's because of chemical and biological warfare.
[00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:13.120]  It's now declassified against you.
[00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.561]  Stay with us.
[00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:21.106]  There are over 550,000 homeless on the streets of America's cities.
[00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:23.327]  36,000 of those are youths.
[00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:23.948]  38,000 are veterans.
[00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:26.269]  And 180,000 are families.
[00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.534]  And if white privilege exists, why is it that white Americans are the largest racial group of homelessness?
[00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:35.435]  Making up 49% of those on the streets.
[00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:43.899]  However, things are tough all over as Black Americans and Native Americans numbers are high compared to their numbers in the general population.
[00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.861]  And the homeless population is gradually increasing.
[00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:48.501]  This is the worst I've ever seen.
[00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:53.344]  There are hundreds and hundreds of gang members and their associates hiding amongst the homeless.
[00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:57.986]  The LAPD says this video shows known gang members brutally beating a man.
[00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:03.811]  Add to this national crisis the stark reality that mental illness is rampant amongst the homeless.
[00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:17.605]  Because roughly 60 years ago, the medical community and the federal government saw to it that long-term state mental institutions were closed in favor of community centers and a growing pharmaceutical industry stranglehold.
[00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:23.509]  There are now 14 slots per 100,000 people available for mental health treatment.
[00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.994]  And private mental health facilities which don't accept insurance can cost upwards of $30,000 per month.
[00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:34.416]  The mental health crisis has spilled out into our streets.
[00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:46.524]  As a study published in the journal Psychiatric Services estimates 3.4% of Americans, 8 million Americans, suffer from serious psychological problems.
[00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:47.645]  For example,
[00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:51.767]  Aditi Saha says a homeless man threatened her with a knife back in July.
[00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:57.750]  Saha says her incident took place just about 500 feet away from where this incident happened early Sunday morning.
[00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.894]  Surveillance cameras were rolling when a woman was attacked by a homeless man out front of her luxury high-rise.
[00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:08.236]  25-year-old Austin Vincent was arrested and now released by the court pending trial.
[00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:16.060]  She tweeted Governor Gavin Newsom Wednesday night attached a video of her attack for him to see, then asked the governor to save San Francisco.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.020]  I don't feel safe.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.641]  I know that we're all at risk, especially when this thing opens up.
[00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.141]  I mean, think about it.
[00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:30.242]  250 new people, new homeless people, that God knows who they are, what they struggle with, whether it's drugs or mental illness.
[00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:33.323]  And all the city is providing is a shelter.
[00:03:33.923 --> 00:03:38.884]  No treatment, no security, no proper planning.
[00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:40.384]  Just a shelter.
[00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:44.885]  President Trump has brought awareness to what many have ignored for too long.
[00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:47.477]  I was talking about mental institutions.
[00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:56.722]  They closed so many, like 92% of the mental institutions around this country over the years for budgetary reasons.
[00:03:57.302 --> 00:03:59.584]  These are people that have to be in institutions.
[00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:01.265]  For help.
[00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:03.847]  I'm not talking about as a form of a prison.
[00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:04.748]  I'm saying for help.
[00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.771]  And I think it's something we have to really look at.
[00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:11.133]  The whole concept of mental institutions.
[00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:14.997]  I remember growing up, we had mental institutions.
[00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.779]  Then they were closed in New York, I'm talking about.
[00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:19.641]  There were many of them were closed.
[00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.062]  A lot of them were closed.
[00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:23.784]  And all of those people were put out on the streets.
[00:04:23.904 --> 00:04:27.107]  And I said, even as a young guy, I said, how does that work?
[00:04:27.147 --> 00:04:28.048]  That's not a good thing.
[00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:28.568]  Now, learn!
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.781]  The declassified plan to literally murder you and your family slowly.
[00:05:07.203 --> 00:05:09.804]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:13.805]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:15.686]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:20.467]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:26.490]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.630]  It's a form of fascism.
[00:05:28.513 --> 00:05:32.154]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:38.996]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:05:43.597 --> 00:05:45.178]  First, they come for Alex Jones.
[00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:47.058]  Everyone else, like Davos, would fall.
[00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:56.441]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:00.197]  You can't watch this.
[00:06:00.497 --> 00:06:00.957]  The movie.
[00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.899]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:18.927]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:21.049]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:23.170]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:37.706]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this August 20th, 2019 broadcast.
[00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:53.643]  And I've been talking the last few weeks about the accelerated global awakening that's taking place and the fact that basically everything that we've trailblazed breaking down is now being admitted and is now coming out in triplicate.
[00:06:56.297 --> 00:07:04.304]  If you took your six-month-old baby and dropped it on its head on purpose, you would lose that child if you were seen doing it.
[00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:05.384]  And you should.
[00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:13.071]  If you took your child in to have a partial lobotomy done, they would arrest the doctors that tried to do it and arrest you.
[00:07:15.873 --> 00:07:24.160]  But if you give that child gender-bending chemicals that also lower their IQ and lower their fertility,
[00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:29.250]  And then takes a minute at age 8 to have their genitals cut off.
[00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.911]  You're called a trendy, cutting-edge person.
[00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.891]  This is all part of transhumanism.
[00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:34.551]  How do I know?
[00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:47.435]  The Tavistock Institute, the Carnegie Endowment, the Scenarion Institutes, they have all admitted the plan.
[00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.316]  We ought to re-air Endgame.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:05.228]  2.0, which was just a talk with the late, great Professor Michael Kaufman, going over 1960s documents for this whole plan.
[00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:11.233]  First, the sexual revolution, so people wouldn't take care of their kids, so they'd run off and leave their husband or wife.
[00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:21.842]  Then once you broke up the family, then you'd start giving chemicals to the children to confuse their sexual proclivities towards depopulation.
[00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.831]  Now, I talk about awakening points.
[00:08:27.972 --> 00:08:48.542]  I've gotten, no exaggeration, I don't know, 20 phone calls or more to my personal cell phone, that's really a robot government tracking device, it's a Trojan horse given to me, given to us all, but let's define things as they are, and just flooding in emails and calls, and everyone breathlessly, the Journal of American
[00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:57.101]  Madison and Harvard, they all just came out and said, gotta take the fluoride out of the water, it's lowering IQs massively.
[00:08:58.963 --> 00:09:07.270]  Oh, and it's double worse with men, boys, and quadruple worse with blacks.
[00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:15.877]  Now, folks, if you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there, why there's mental illness everywhere, why people seem
[00:09:17.353 --> 00:09:43.038]  So incredibly stupid, it's because the Soviets, the Communists, the proto-globalists that took over, had work camps, and they put hydrofluorosilic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the Gulags, in the Gulag Archipelago.
[00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.599]  And that's in Pulitzer Prize winning history books.
[00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:59.113]  Before World War II started, at the very beginning, there was an alliance between Russia and the Nazis, and they exchanged information, and the Nazis put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water.
[00:10:00.414 --> 00:10:05.095]  That came out in Nuremberg, because it made people docile.
[00:10:06.396 --> 00:10:15.940]  Now, I went to HEB this morning, the crew did, walked right in, it says, HEB, baby,
[00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:18.077]  Fluoride water.
[00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:20.879]  Let's zoom right in on that.
[00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:22.660]  And notice it shows you the target.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:31.786]  It's kind of like buying a box of 30-odd-6 rifle shells, rifle rounds, and on the cover is a deer.
[00:10:33.047 --> 00:10:34.808]  And there's a little crosshair on the side of the deer.
[00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.791]  Or if you go buy cockroach poison.
[00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:42.114]  A lot of it is fluoride, by the way.
[00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:47.059]  And it'll show the cockroach on the front with a target on it, or if you're getting stuff to kill wasps.
[00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:50.180]  It'll show a target on wasps, right?
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:11:10.164]  Well, right here, the HEB, fluoride-added water, for your boy, is nothing but a box of rifle shells, firing electrified molecules of weaponized fluoride into the brain.
[00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:11.504]  But let me give you the rest of the story.
[00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.434]  Everybody when they did this in the 40s knew it was going on, so they freaked out about it.
[00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:27.442]  Everybody knew that mainline poison you sprinkled around the house was just standard fluoride.
[00:11:28.643 --> 00:11:30.905]  Well, you're gonna put electrified fluoride?
[00:11:32.547 --> 00:11:34.730]  Fluoride's gonna turn into a psychoactive acid?
[00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.431]  But there's more.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.583]  Then they don't have to put as many of the other chemicals in.
[00:11:38.603 --> 00:11:40.466]  They're putting all sorts of drugs in the water.
[00:11:40.807 --> 00:11:50.000]  And there's waivers in the Clean Water Act, there's waivers in Prop 65 in California, where you can't have one billionth of lead in your product.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.262]  I mean, the air has more than that.
[00:11:52.028 --> 00:11:52.949]  So the lawyers can sue you.
[00:11:53.229 --> 00:12:02.755]  But if you want to dump hydrofluorosilic acid and other grignard reagents, because there's a waiver to 400 plus chemicals, in, it's good.
[00:12:02.795 --> 00:12:08.039]  So they dump the toxic waste in the water and all the leftists religiously filter their water.
[00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:09.259]  They don't shower in it.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.901]  It's for you.
[00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:12.502]  It's for me.
[00:12:13.242 --> 00:12:14.283]  And it's for boys.
[00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:22.028]  We've covered this probably, let's not exaggerate, a thousand times over the last 20 years on air.
[00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.113]  And it comes out in a major study in JAMA.
[00:12:31.635 --> 00:12:42.203]  The most prestigious there is in quadruple blind studies over years and they show exactly what the Japanese, the Chinese, the Mexican, the Brazilian, the German studies show.
[00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:46.122]  Massive cancer increases.
[00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:47.883]  Massive bone cancer.
[00:12:48.263 --> 00:12:49.444]  Massive infertility.
[00:12:49.804 --> 00:12:51.264]  Massive IQ reductions.
[00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:56.827]  Four times in a black male what it is in a white woman.
[00:12:58.428 --> 00:12:59.208]  Now why is that?
[00:13:00.289 --> 00:13:06.272]  Because men don't have blood-brain barriers as strong as women.
[00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:10.514]  Any physician will tell you, going back 5,000 years, that women
[00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:17.885]  Babies are twice as strong as male babies when it comes to the injuries.
[00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:21.566]  Women can take more bullet holes, more blood loss, all of it.
[00:13:21.626 --> 00:13:27.247]  We're designed different because they're meant to be able to carry a baby and then have that traumatic event happen.
[00:13:27.508 --> 00:13:35.890]  Women are tough, not in the physical ways we are, but in the other ways to survive on less food, less water, everything.
[00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.770]  This hurts women.
[00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.790]  It hurts them bad.
[00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.131]  But boy, you talk about Black Lives Matter, baby.
[00:13:43.663 --> 00:13:49.065]  Can you imagine what it's like to be black and to have drunk this when you were a child?
[00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:52.787]  They're talking about a 40 point IQ reduction.
[00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:55.008]  Mental retardation in most people.
[00:13:55.748 --> 00:13:57.589]  If you're going to have 140 IQ, you have 100.
[00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:05.513]  If you were going to have 100, you are going to be mentally retarded below 70, unable to tie your shoelaces.
[00:14:07.284 --> 00:14:08.205]  That's all in the studies.
[00:14:08.745 --> 00:14:09.846]  I don't just have the new one.
[00:14:09.946 --> 00:14:11.147]  I've got a whole bunch of them.
[00:14:11.507 --> 00:14:13.969]  It's a fact, and it was done on purpose.
[00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.590]  And we take it.
[00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.092]  Now let me give you the next big piece of the enchilada.
[00:14:22.574 --> 00:14:23.775]  5G is fluoride 2.0.
[00:14:26.357 --> 00:14:35.183]  5G literally destroys the cells in the body, vibrating at a perfect frequency to break molecules in half.
[00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:41.633]  You know how you put a hot dog in the microwave for 30 seconds and it plumps up and does all that?
[00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:49.420]  All the studies show that regular cell phone radiation heats the brain one degree after 15 minutes of cell use.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.041]  If you have it up against your head.
[00:14:51.642 --> 00:14:52.202]  Oh, it's killing!
[00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:54.624]  But slowly.
[00:14:55.264 --> 00:14:58.327]  Like leaving a grilled cheese on all day, but it finally gets delicious.
[00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:01.890]  So remember, these are all bullets right here.
[00:15:03.154 --> 00:15:05.056]  Now, if I took a baby in here, I would never do that.
[00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:06.157]  Put it in the crib right there.
[00:15:07.598 --> 00:15:13.023]  And if I threw bottles of this chemical weapon at it, they'd arrest me.
[00:15:13.343 --> 00:15:14.284]  I was just throwing at the baby.
[00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:15.946]  Of course, that really wouldn't hurt the baby.
[00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:16.586]  Maybe scratch it.
[00:15:16.987 --> 00:15:17.587]  But they'd be wrong.
[00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:23.653]  But, if mommy goes and gets it, because it says it's for babies, then I've got the studies for you.
[00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:30.356]  They've been trying to hedge their bets the last decade, going, well, actually, kids shouldn't drink fluoridated water before their teeth erupt.
[00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:34.437]  It causes dental fluorosis, weakening of the enamel, and chalking.
[00:15:34.697 --> 00:15:35.577]  By the way, my dad's a dentist.
[00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.878]  And I got those studies I'm gonna show you.
[00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:46.021]  So, you specifically shouldn't give it to a baby, even if you think it's good for your teeth later, which it's not.
[00:15:48.161 --> 00:15:49.222]  It's a chemical weapon.
[00:15:49.862 --> 00:15:50.902]  And it's going on everywhere.
[00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:52.483]  So you wonder why people are so dumb.
[00:15:53.464 --> 00:16:02.946]  Folks, the average black man who was raised in a city with a poor nation has a 35 to 40 point lower attention.
[00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:08.988]  This is history.
[00:16:09.988 --> 00:16:14.509]  We've got two Google engineers that have the courage to go public.
[00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:16.602]  The first one and the second one.
[00:16:16.722 --> 00:16:17.702]  Others have just leaked stuff.
[00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:26.086]  And they're there together interfacing for the first time live on an alternative system that Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple didn't want to exist.
[00:16:26.247 --> 00:16:27.807]  They knew it would threaten them in the future.
[00:16:27.827 --> 00:16:30.369]  And it was here to challenge their information dominance.
[00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:31.569]  And history's happening.
[00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:38.393]  That's why listeners and viewers buying products, going to the store, getting things you already need at InfoWareStore.com is the reason this is happening.
[00:16:38.993 --> 00:16:39.994]  You guys have the floor.
[00:16:40.094 --> 00:16:45.919]  Both of you, Zach Voorhees on Twitter, Perpetual Maniac, Greg Coppola on Twitter for now, and Coppola underscore Gregory.
[00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:47.140]  What do you think's coming next?
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.301]  Why did you go public?
[00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:49.942]  Obviously more whistleblowers are coming.
[00:16:50.022 --> 00:16:53.565]  This is an amazing Watershed Moment, so go ahead and take over.
[00:16:53.745 --> 00:17:02.072]  Yeah, so six years I was asleep within the company, and then the last two years it was fully awake, and that process started.
[00:17:02.692 --> 00:17:07.857]  And once it started, you know, I remember the last thing thinking to myself, what else are they lying about?
[00:17:08.657 --> 00:17:09.278]  And that was it.
[00:17:09.358 --> 00:17:09.678]  Wow.
[00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:10.459]  You know, bam.
[00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:11.480]  It just came.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:19.908]  And for two years, I was really, really, really suffering being inside of YouTube and Google and seeing the company transform like this.
[00:17:20.168 --> 00:17:23.451]  I felt really guilty about drawing a salary.
[00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:27.695]  And I tried to let people know that this was coming.
[00:17:28.693 --> 00:17:35.436]  And now that I've released all of the information, I realize I'm not part of that evil, evil system anymore.
[00:17:36.176 --> 00:17:42.739]  And it's very uplifting and I feel that I can, you know, meet my maker at the very end.
[00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:46.340]  And when he says, you came across evil, what did you do?
[00:17:46.661 --> 00:17:54.484]  And I'll be able to like look him right in the eye and said, I sacrificed everything to let the American people know that the AI weapons were pointed directly at their mind.
[00:17:54.804 --> 00:18:02.413]  You know, I think when I was comfortably drawing my paycheck, I felt, you know, more comfortable, more certain.
[00:18:02.433 --> 00:18:07.259]  Now I feel there's definitely a lot of uncertainty, but I feel more alert.
[00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:13.506]  And obviously, you know, just the fact that I'm not anonymous kind of makes life a little more dangerous, which is kind of actually making me a little bit more awake.
[00:18:13.746 --> 00:18:17.709]  First of all, I'm really curious when they're gonna admit that Zach's leaks have happened.
[00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:19.550]  I mean, like, I mean, I'm talking about the mainstream media here.
[00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:28.577]  You know, that could be an interesting thing, and just, like, what's gonna happen when they have to say, you know, this actually happened weeks ago, uh, that Zach leaked all these things, and we just didn't tell you, and these...
[00:18:29.097 --> 00:18:32.280]  You know, they're alleging that there's a system of censorship and we didn't tell you about it for two weeks.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.022]  I mean, is that gonna kind of get anyone thinking?
[00:18:35.062 --> 00:18:35.482]  I don't know.
[00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:39.845]  And secondly, I think, you know, I would just underline that with Zach Stump.
[00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:41.546]  I mean, I think you've really seen everything now.
[00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.368]  It's all, I don't even think we need another leak.
[00:18:43.408 --> 00:18:49.753]  I mean, I'm sure some people are looking for it and some people might leak other things that are interesting, but I actually don't even think that we need anything else.
[00:18:49.813 --> 00:18:52.835]  And I think it's really important for consumers to just say like,
[00:18:53.644 --> 00:18:54.545]  Uh, look, there's a bias.
[00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:55.105]  We can see it.
[00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:56.126]  Everything's set by hand.
[00:18:56.146 --> 00:18:57.467]  It's nothing to do with computers at all.
[00:18:58.067 --> 00:18:58.808]  And... Well, that's it.
[00:18:58.848 --> 00:19:02.870]  You just said something... God, I love talking to you guys with 150 IQs, 160 IQs.
[00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:15.579]  Because, exactly, everybody's always the next dump, the next piece, the next... What do you need when you have them saying blacklist and they've lied to Congress and said there aren't specific names, my names and others' names?
[00:19:15.699 --> 00:19:17.460]  It's all right there.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.381]  We have them.
[00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:21.823]  It's a pile of smoky guns as big as Mount Everest is what you're saying.
[00:19:21.923 --> 00:19:30.010]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the meme where there's like a dog in the building and everything's on fire and he's just, you know, saying, oh, yeah, everything's fine.
[00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.833]  You know, the American people have had a fire woken up in them.
[00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:37.857]  And I think that they're really going to, you know, have a conversation with the representative.
[00:19:38.358 --> 00:19:44.083]  And, you know, that representative is going to come back from recess and they're going to be energized.
[00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:48.145]  To, you know, start working through what the solutions are.
[00:19:48.165 --> 00:19:49.705]  This is history-making.
[00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:52.567]  Two senior Google engineers at a whistleblown.
[00:19:52.927 --> 00:19:56.508]  The first two publicly coming together live on InfoWars.
[00:19:56.668 --> 00:20:00.750]  If that isn't radioactive kryptonite to tyranny, I don't know what the hell is.
[00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:09.534]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:27.284 --> 00:20:32.705]  Well, if you just joined us, I think it's over in Daria's office.
[00:20:32.725 --> 00:20:37.267]  There's a copy of Ecoscience from 1974, the year I was born.
[00:20:38.047 --> 00:20:45.809]  Many decades later, the author became the head of Obama's science committee, his chief science officer.
[00:20:47.816 --> 00:20:48.936]  Took direct orders from Bill Gates.
[00:20:49.637 --> 00:20:50.457]  Eco-science.
[00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:51.598]  You can pull it up online.
[00:20:52.038 --> 00:20:56.120]  Talks about fluoride in the water to lower your IQ and to lower fertility.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.060]  And it calls for increasing it.
[00:20:58.521 --> 00:20:59.661]  And boy, have they.
[00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:01.962]  And the IQs have gone straight down.
[00:21:02.342 --> 00:21:03.463]  Just like idiocracy.
[00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:05.724]  But it didn't take 400 years.
[00:21:06.604 --> 00:21:08.225]  It happened in just a few decades.
[00:21:09.005 --> 00:21:10.045]  And now it's getting worse.
[00:21:10.926 --> 00:21:12.466]  First, they stun you with a soft kill.
[00:21:12.506 --> 00:21:15.708]  So, if you just tuned in, study
[00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:23.492]  Prompts calls for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women because massive IQ reductions in boys particularly.
[00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:26.933]  Oh my goodness, that's Reuters!
[00:21:27.053 --> 00:21:30.475]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:21:31.135 --> 00:21:33.936]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:21:34.456 --> 00:21:36.577]  And here's a Harvard study from eight years ago.
[00:21:36.757 --> 00:21:39.198]  Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children.
[00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:40.279]  Found the exact same thing.
[00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:42.900]  Got the studies out of Mexico, out of China.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.781]  Oh, oh, but...
[00:21:45.618 --> 00:21:48.120]  I've also got the study showing it hurts your teeth.
[00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:50.542]  But let me show you this.
[00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.145]  Let me show you this.
[00:21:55.926 --> 00:22:01.130]  If you're a TV viewer, Alex Jones top ten health claims and why they're wrong.
[00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.032]  And when you read number five,
[00:22:04.997 --> 00:22:09.398]  From Forbes, the fluoride in drinking water is making people dumb.
[00:22:10.139 --> 00:22:14.260]  Alex Jones stated, I grew up in Dallas, Texas, drinking sodium fluoridated water.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.302]  All the scientific studies show my IQ has been reduced by at least 20 points.
[00:22:20.042 --> 00:22:28.985]  Yeah, they found in the Harvard study, six years of ingesting 1.3 parts per million lowered IQ on average about 10 points.
[00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:33.166]  So, you know, I'm saying, well, I drank it longer than that, so that's 20 points, because it's cumulative.
[00:22:33.831 --> 00:22:36.113]  And of course, they don't tell you I was showing the study on air.
[00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:40.396]  They just go, oh look, they go on to say it's preposterous and ridiculous.
[00:22:40.476 --> 00:22:41.777]  Ooh, they use the word ridiculous.
[00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:45.800]  Well, that proves that I'm this big liar.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:52.606]  They said I'm, but wait, they take the David Hogg statement and they say, but Jones sells water filters.
[00:22:53.607 --> 00:22:57.550]  Yeah, it's like selling life jackets to people when they buy a boat.
[00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:00.752]  Or, hey, you're going camping.
[00:23:00.792 --> 00:23:03.554]  Want some bug spray to keep the bugs off?
[00:23:03.854 --> 00:23:04.995]  Hey, you got teeth.
[00:23:05.095 --> 00:23:06.256]  I'm selling toothbrushes.
[00:23:06.776 --> 00:23:07.937]  But oh, it's a scam.
[00:23:09.338 --> 00:23:12.419]  We sell the highest rated water filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.540]  It's what I use!
[00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:14.601]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:16.182]  Let's go back to what they had at...
[00:23:17.489 --> 00:23:19.470]  Babies-R-Us and H-E-B and everywhere.
[00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.871]  There's whole aisles of the different... Oh, fluoride for your baby!
[00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:24.372]  And then they've tested this.
[00:23:24.412 --> 00:23:26.173]  This is way over 1.3.
[00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:29.554]  So you get real brain cooking with this.
[00:23:30.474 --> 00:23:32.195]  It's for your baby!
[00:23:32.915 --> 00:23:36.697]  And if you taste it... Here, let me be a snake charmer here and drink poison.
[00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:38.318]  The Bible says no weapon for me.
[00:23:38.338 --> 00:23:39.018]  This will prosper.
[00:23:39.038 --> 00:23:41.219]  Unless they're targeting children and they're unconscious.
[00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:42.659]  And years ago I tasted it.
[00:23:42.679 --> 00:23:44.840]  It tastes like Houston water.
[00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:46.461]  Pumped out of a toilet.
[00:23:49.272 --> 00:23:53.575]  I mean, oh baby, it's time to kill brain cells!
[00:23:56.057 --> 00:23:57.318]  So, document cam shot.
[00:23:57.939 --> 00:24:08.387]  It would be much nicer to these babies, you know, that the left wants to kill in the womb or kill after they're born, keep them comfortable, to just basically put them in front of a firing squad.
[00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.069]  But instead, oh, it's so much more fun.
[00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.371]  So much more fun.
[00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:16.039]  Take our time.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.621]  So much more fun to take our time.
[00:24:20.321 --> 00:24:24.343]  And then it's bye-bye brain, and you've got a good automaton.
[00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:25.363]  Remember the movie?
[00:24:25.423 --> 00:24:26.123]  It was a good movie.
[00:24:26.143 --> 00:24:28.984]  It was a Disney movie to counter Star Wars.
[00:24:29.004 --> 00:24:28.984]  1978.
[00:24:29.365 --> 00:24:30.745]  The Black Hole.
[00:24:33.086 --> 00:24:34.627]  With Maximilian Schell.
[00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:39.408]  And this mission to the Black Hole never came back, and they get there, and where's the crew?
[00:24:39.589 --> 00:24:40.609]  Oh, they all died.
[00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:42.930]  But they notice that the robots have a limp.
[00:24:43.826 --> 00:24:44.526]  Look, humanoid.
[00:24:44.986 --> 00:24:47.087]  Well, they've given them lobotomies.
[00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:49.708]  Isn't that loving?
[00:24:49.728 --> 00:24:52.169]  But see, that's a black hole movie.
[00:24:52.209 --> 00:24:53.470]  That's scary.
[00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:54.710]  Oh my goodness.
[00:24:55.471 --> 00:24:57.911]  But when it's done like, Mommy!
[00:24:58.752 --> 00:25:00.713]  Give them what they need!
[00:25:00.733 --> 00:25:03.634]  And oh, keep that Alex Jones off the air.
[00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:09.316]  In China, they work to filter the fluoride out of their water because it's naturally in their soil there.
[00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:13.700]  It's in a lot of our soil, too, but that's just the normal calcium fluoride.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.664]  And then they add iodine to the local reservoirs.
[00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:19.785]  You can look at the videos online.
[00:25:19.805 --> 00:25:27.912]  They'll have tanks, depending on the size of the lake or the pond, the water container with a big tank that puts fluoride in.
[00:25:29.493 --> 00:25:30.774]  Oh, but Alex Jones is bad, too.
[00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:32.236]  He sells good iodine.
[00:25:32.516 --> 00:25:35.418]  Don't listen to him, because it's the good halogen, not the bad one.
[00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:38.001]  Oh, and one of our great crew members,
[00:25:39.444 --> 00:25:57.233]  Added this point, he's a big swimmer and a big health aficionado, and Connor was telling me earlier, he goes, you know, it's funny about women having twice as good a blood-brain barrier, that's why the toxins don't hurt them as bad, it's because they have this particular chemical in it, and he goes, and I was reading in a major medical journal that that's what krill oil is, and why it's so important to boost IQ.
[00:25:57.973 --> 00:26:07.698]  My 27-month-old daughter, this morning, was looking at a book, and it had an American Eagle in it, and she pointed at it and said, that's the hero!
[00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:12.558]  And my wife said, what does that mean?
[00:26:12.618 --> 00:26:14.019]  And she pointed and means his daddy.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.141]  She's never watched the show, any of that.
[00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:20.944]  She's like a Martian, head in the hundred percentile, walking around.
[00:26:21.324 --> 00:26:22.845]  People think she's five years old.
[00:26:22.865 --> 00:26:27.248]  In fact, I think my wife's going to let me bring her on air because you got, she's phenomenal.
[00:26:27.268 --> 00:26:28.549]  And everybody loves their kids.
[00:26:28.569 --> 00:26:30.290]  We'll tell you this, all my kids, you've seen Rex.
[00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:32.731]  Piece of work as well.
[00:26:33.132 --> 00:26:38.454]  But I'm telling you, this little cupcake, and she's been getting fish oil since she was a week old.
[00:26:38.995 --> 00:26:42.657]  The purest, best in her little bottles.
[00:26:42.717 --> 00:26:43.497]  And now it goes in her cups.
[00:26:44.017 --> 00:26:50.561]  I just prick the krill oil, put a half a dose in there, and boy, she's on fire.
[00:26:51.141 --> 00:26:53.082]  And so yes, I do sell Ultimate Krill Oil as well.
[00:26:53.783 --> 00:26:58.625]  Or you can just listen to the New World Order, and you can do whatever they tell you.
[00:26:58.645 --> 00:26:59.766]  Do you ever get the David Hogg queued up?
[00:27:01.843 --> 00:27:02.303]  We have it.
[00:27:02.483 --> 00:27:03.984]  Here's David Hogg though and here's Forbes.
[00:27:04.004 --> 00:27:13.846]  The talking point is this man is so evil that he tells you there's radioactive isotopes in most of the water and there's hundreds of chemicals on average and glyphosate that grows breast cancer.
[00:27:14.526 --> 00:27:16.027]  It's miracle grow for breast cancer.
[00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:16.847]  It literally does it.
[00:27:18.147 --> 00:27:19.808]  Mimics the hormone that makes the cancer grow.
[00:27:21.497 --> 00:27:27.960]  Oh, and I found another article where frogs are raping other male frogs, but also boa constrictors.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.281]  In fact, I sent you guys that article.
[00:27:29.321 --> 00:27:34.784]  Maybe we'll find it during the break, but they're just attacking everyone because of the atrazine running off.
[00:27:34.804 --> 00:27:35.724]  That's mainstream news.
[00:27:36.264 --> 00:27:38.426]  Oh, but David Hogg says I'm bad, see?
[00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:39.306]  No, no, no.
[00:27:39.606 --> 00:27:40.246]  Drink it.
[00:27:40.286 --> 00:27:41.067]  Don't filter it.
[00:27:41.687 --> 00:27:43.588]  And certainly don't support someone that exposes it.
[00:27:44.008 --> 00:27:45.089]  Don't buy your filters from him.
[00:27:45.129 --> 00:27:45.889]  Let him go bankrupt.
[00:27:46.169 --> 00:27:46.790]  Shut him up!
[00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.990]  Here's David Hogg.
[00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.651]  When individuals say these things to us, I think it's important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make money off them.
[00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:07.853]  For example, one of the main people in this situation that I don't want to name the name of, but as you said is from InfoWars, he shouts a lot.
[00:28:08.073 --> 00:28:08.794]  I'll just give you that hint.
[00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:09.294]  He looks red.
[00:28:11.778 --> 00:28:21.281]  He's advertising many of these things, and the power lies in these advertisers to pull out of these fear-mongering, hate-loving people that just want to spread hate and division in America.
[00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:32.365]  For example, on InfoWars, one of the main things that he spoke, one of his famous things is saying that, one of his most famous statements was saying that, Tapwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[00:28:32.425 --> 00:28:34.026]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:35.566]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:28:36.006 --> 00:28:40.828]  And secondly, if you noticed at the end of that video, he advertises water filters.
[00:28:41.454 --> 00:28:42.315]  Good to go.
[00:28:42.335 --> 00:28:42.775]  Interesting.
[00:29:08.238 --> 00:29:11.983]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:14.245]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[00:29:14.466 --> 00:29:15.307]  This is not a movie.
[00:29:15.327 --> 00:29:16.148]  This is not a drill.
[00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:17.029]  This is not fiction.
[00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:18.791]  This is reality.
[00:29:19.505 --> 00:29:26.270]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.532]  Pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[00:29:29.572 --> 00:29:30.993]  So Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[00:29:31.053 --> 00:29:32.954]  And I'll say this, it's all of our birthright.
[00:29:33.034 --> 00:29:38.738]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:29:38.798 --> 00:29:40.979]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:45.963]  We're seeing election meddling, and it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor.
[00:29:46.343 --> 00:29:46.543]  I think?
[00:30:02.293 --> 00:30:06.994]  We wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[00:30:07.094 --> 00:30:12.455]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[00:30:12.575 --> 00:30:19.316]  It's the big, giant 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, but only on 50-something items.
[00:30:19.536 --> 00:30:22.417]  Not on every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[00:30:22.457 --> 00:30:28.558]  Whether it's Ultimate Krill Oil, Body's Turmeric, Brain Force Plus, Knock Off Sleep Aid, Turbo Force, 8-Pack Power Stack, it's all
[00:30:28.558 --> 00:30:30.779]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to US elections?
[00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:33.160]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's
[00:30:55.091 --> 00:31:09.590]  Google, together with Facebook, together with Twitter, they formed this echo chamber in which if they want to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going to press down the voices.
[00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:13.014]  That they don't want, and they're going to boost up the voices that they do.
[00:31:13.074 --> 00:31:17.499]  And InfoWars has been sort of the main victim in this.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:30.554]  And it's clear that if your audience looks through the disclosure list posted at ProjectVeritas.com, they're going to see InfoWars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[00:31:30.734 --> 00:31:36.179]  Google's mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
[00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:41.644]  When InfoWars was taken offline, was that making information universally accessible and useful?
[00:31:41.664 --> 00:31:42.304]  No, it wasn't.
[00:31:42.524 --> 00:31:49.050]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.691]  elections?
[00:31:50.211 --> 00:31:54.254]  And what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[00:31:55.435 --> 00:31:58.037]  Yeah, well, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[00:31:58.217 --> 00:31:59.958]  Like, there's been a huge document dump.
[00:31:59.998 --> 00:32:05.280]  I've released over 950 pages, and right now there is a crowd raid.
[00:32:06.241 --> 00:32:15.245]  There are a bunch of users, they're looking at these documents, they're digesting them, and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[00:32:15.825 --> 00:32:20.848]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online
[00:32:21.948 --> 00:32:24.770]  Go to Project Veritas, see their disclosure.
[00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.671]  They've posted a link to all these documents.
[00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:31.533]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything.zip file and just go to town.
[00:32:31.674 --> 00:32:36.496]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google's doing, I promise you, it's way, way worse.
[00:32:36.696 --> 00:32:41.399]  And, you know, I see the reaction online and everyone's like, you know, WTF?
[00:32:41.639 --> 00:32:42.239]  WTF?
[00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:47.482]  And I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen, uh, privately.
[00:32:47.502 --> 00:32:49.063]  Uh, and, you know,
[00:32:49.603 --> 00:32:58.333]  We're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness and people are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[00:33:06.362 --> 00:33:09.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.157 --> 00:33:22.178]  Devastating globalist lies.
[00:33:22.778 --> 00:33:26.400]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.842]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption.
[00:33:30.282 --> 00:33:34.084]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:34.644 --> 00:33:36.365]  Transmitting worldwide.
[00:33:36.905 --> 00:33:38.206]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.045 --> 00:33:43.248]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:45.730 --> 00:34:03.263]  I don't know about you, but I'm angry that I read this book written 45 years ago when I was born by the later White House science czar, John P. Holdren, saying that they put the fluoride in the water to lower our RQs and fertility.
[00:34:03.283 --> 00:34:07.766]  Because, of course, one of the most studied compounds elements out there.
[00:34:09.232 --> 00:34:11.893]  And then everybody's calling me, oh my gosh, Reuters AP!
[00:34:12.413 --> 00:34:15.674]  Study prompts calls for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women.
[00:34:16.434 --> 00:34:20.436]  Massive IQ reductions in boys particularly because of blood-brain barrier being weaker.
[00:34:20.636 --> 00:34:24.297]  The Daily Beast, study links fluoridated water during pregnancy with lower IQs.
[00:34:25.057 --> 00:34:27.478]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy with lower IQs.
[00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:31.468]  You know, you've got moms making their boys transgender.
[00:34:31.488 --> 00:34:33.850]  How about translobotomies?
[00:34:34.511 --> 00:34:38.935]  There are people that burn their eyes out with Drano to be trans-abled.
[00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:43.920]  Moms already give their boys Ritalin to stunt their IQ and teach them how to behave.
[00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:50.206]  They already tell them to chop their genitals off, so how about more fluoride for that baby boy?
[00:34:52.242 --> 00:34:54.404]  Study links fluorinated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:34:54.424 --> 00:34:54.825]  Another story.
[00:34:54.905 --> 00:34:55.425]  Oh, another one.
[00:34:56.066 --> 00:34:57.167]  This is from eight years ago.
[00:34:57.287 --> 00:34:59.250]  Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children.
[00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.251]  Harvard study.
[00:35:00.311 --> 00:35:01.412]  Massive IQ reductions.
[00:35:03.094 --> 00:35:05.797]  But the best part's the bone cancer and the infertility.
[00:35:06.857 --> 00:35:09.217]  And you look how the IQ in the U.S.
[00:35:09.297 --> 00:35:11.038]  is dropping the fastest in the world.
[00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:12.098]  Major studies on that.
[00:35:12.758 --> 00:35:15.359]  Oh, but Forbes came out and they said I'm a kook.
[00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:17.559]  Now, we can put this article up on screen.
[00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:19.519]  Maybe put the color version up so folks can see it.
[00:35:19.819 --> 00:35:20.860]  Kind of blurs out there.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.460]  There you go.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.941]  Horny, confused cane toads are humping a python.
[00:35:26.641 --> 00:35:29.261]  Biologists say it's atrazine runoff.
[00:35:30.281 --> 00:35:32.782]  Causes them to... well, the males to...
[00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:36.594]  Only have sex with other males and then to rape other animals.
[00:35:38.076 --> 00:35:38.597]  There you go.
[00:35:38.677 --> 00:35:42.682]  But again, I'm the bad guy for just telling you what was in Mainline Studies decades ago.
[00:35:43.343 --> 00:35:44.444]  And here you've got it right here.
[00:35:44.924 --> 00:35:45.826]  Fluoride water.
[00:35:47.116 --> 00:36:04.047]  For your babies, and after Gavin McGinnis leaves us, I will get to the other studies on that for you, about how you shouldn't have any fluoride until your teeth come in because it causes dental fluorosis in the development of the bones and makes the teeth brittle.
[00:36:04.868 --> 00:36:05.668]  But that's okay.
[00:36:06.129 --> 00:36:07.890]  Oh, it's baby with fluoride.
[00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:08.650]  We're going to cover it.
[00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:14.174]  And there's all this Colgate with the fluoride in it for your kids, and you wonder why they get so stupid.
[00:36:15.253 --> 00:36:25.181]  Of course, you might want to go to InfoWareStore.com and fund the operation to warn people while protecting yourself with ultimate krill oil that the major studies say is the only thing that increases the blood-brain barrier.
[00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:28.644]  Oh, don't want Junior taking that.
[00:36:29.205 --> 00:36:34.750]  Don't want to put any of that in the baby's muke, because you'll have a brainiac, the giant brain,
[00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.014]  Now, joining us is Gavin McGinnis, and I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[00:36:41.056 --> 00:36:46.102]  Mom of three arrested, jailed for putting recycling in wrong color bag.
[00:36:46.122 --> 00:36:49.186]  That's up on DrugsReport.com, just to show you how they're going after the good guys.
[00:36:49.266 --> 00:36:53.191]  And then, proud boys, Maxwell Hare, John Kingsman,
[00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.371]  Convicted of U.E.S.
[00:36:56.431 --> 00:36:57.971]  brawl with Antifa.
[00:36:58.612 --> 00:36:59.512]  Gavin was there speaking.
[00:36:59.572 --> 00:37:00.552]  Antifa came to shut it down.
[00:37:00.592 --> 00:37:01.313]  We've seen all the footage.
[00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:02.233]  Antifa attacks them.
[00:37:02.613 --> 00:37:07.435]  But for the crime of fighting back against the meth heads... Well, they've been convicted.
[00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:08.575]  They've been railroaded.
[00:37:08.995 --> 00:37:12.296]  And we'll show some of the footage that night of the Proud Boys being attacked first.
[00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:15.918]  You saw the Proud Boys carry out a very peaceful operation in Portland.
[00:37:17.158 --> 00:37:18.279]  Led by Joe Biggs and others.
[00:37:19.299 --> 00:37:20.319]  But the media tried to ignore that.
[00:37:20.339 --> 00:37:21.100]  But AP got it right.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.240]  They said that the Proud Boys were
[00:37:23.626 --> 00:37:24.787]  I don't have plenty of time to talk to you.
[00:37:24.847 --> 00:37:25.247]  I'm stunned.
[00:37:25.267 --> 00:37:26.528]  You won't believe these charges.
[00:37:26.548 --> 00:37:27.429]  Felony, gang assault,
[00:37:50.211 --> 00:37:53.233]  Attempted assault, which is a term I'd never heard before.
[00:37:53.653 --> 00:38:00.757]  One of the people that Max has the attempted assault charge on, his only contact was the guy kicking Max.
[00:38:01.617 --> 00:38:07.700]  So, to be beaten by someone is now you attempting to assault them.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.442]  And these guys got three felonies each.
[00:38:11.282 --> 00:38:13.343]  They're facing 15 years in prison.
[00:38:13.643 --> 00:38:15.864]  Meanwhile, that same day, Antifa
[00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:18.019]  I think so.
[00:38:32.657 --> 00:38:34.598]  After who were arresting them, right?
[00:38:34.958 --> 00:38:38.219]  They went to court, Paul Williams, the victim said, that's the guy.
[00:38:38.239 --> 00:38:40.240]  Maybe it was Paul Miller, I forget his name.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.280]  But those are the guys.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.822]  They got away with misdemeanors, no criminal record, no media attention.
[00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:48.723]  You can't find any of these antifa online.
[00:38:48.763 --> 00:38:50.103]  They've been scrubbed from the internet.
[00:38:50.463 --> 00:39:00.007]  Meanwhile, the guys who are just walking home, in that footage you see them, they're on their way home, police escort, they get ambushed, they fight back, and the DA says, well,
[00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:02.749]  They fought back with too much enthusiasm.
[00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.651]  So, they're facing 15 years in prison.
[00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:06.352]  Guilty!
[00:39:08.754 --> 00:39:10.815]  Well, Trump's gonna need to pardon these guys.
[00:39:10.855 --> 00:39:13.197]  I've never seen such a miscarriage of justice.
[00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:14.878]  I've watched all the footage, all of it's on tape.
[00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:19.382]  They get followed, they get attacked, and for fighting back, now they're gonna go to prison.
[00:39:20.383 --> 00:39:21.644]  One of them's already in Rikers.
[00:39:21.824 --> 00:39:26.147]  Jeff, uh, my buddy Jeff is, um, I forget his last name.
[00:39:26.888 --> 00:39:28.489]  Uh, he's in Rikers right now.
[00:39:28.509 --> 00:39:29.530]  He's doing weekends.
[00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:35.254]  And he said to me that the other prisoners there at Rikers go, what the hell are you doing here?
[00:39:35.595 --> 00:39:39.958]  And the corrections officers are getting to know the story and they go, what were you supposed to do?
[00:39:40.518 --> 00:39:51.785]  Tell me what you do when you, the Antifa draws a line in the sand, throws a bottle of urine at you after days and days of terror and says, we are not civil.
[00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:53.727]  We are going to destroy you.
[00:39:54.367 --> 00:39:55.508]  And then they get ambushed.
[00:39:55.528 --> 00:39:57.029]  Should they just sit there and take the beating?
[00:39:57.049 --> 00:39:58.990]  Because that's what the court said yesterday.
[00:39:59.010 --> 00:39:59.971]  Take a beating.
[00:40:01.323 --> 00:40:07.045]  And again, we're showing footage from every angle of the cowardly meth-head scum attacking.
[00:40:07.506 --> 00:40:11.067]  And they didn't even show up, obviously, because they know they don't want their identities blown.
[00:40:11.467 --> 00:40:16.970]  So for fighting back against masked men, they now are facing 15 years in jail.
[00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.610]  This is incredible.
[00:40:18.447 --> 00:40:20.188]  It's an irrelevant fight, too.
[00:40:20.248 --> 00:40:25.352]  This is a silly... If it was a brawl in hockey, it wouldn't even register with the fan.
[00:40:25.832 --> 00:40:29.155]  This was just a high school fight, like you've seen a million times.
[00:40:29.235 --> 00:40:30.656]  It was a little short skirmish.
[00:40:30.716 --> 00:40:32.657]  I mean, nobody got their ass handed to them.
[00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:35.599]  It was, like, 17 seconds long.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.221]  There was no major injuries.
[00:40:37.461 --> 00:40:39.002]  There was no blood anywhere.
[00:40:39.282 --> 00:40:43.285]  It was just some guys jumped, a bunch of blue-collar dudes who know how to fight.
[00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:45.326]  The blue-collar guys got fought back.
[00:40:45.907 --> 00:40:47.448]  The so-called victim said,
[00:40:48.158 --> 00:40:48.398]  F.U.
[00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.579]  pig to the cops.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.401]  Cops said, all right, I guess you don't need my help.
[00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:53.102]  And everyone went home.
[00:40:53.383 --> 00:41:02.690]  It was only the next day after de Blasio and Cuomo and the Attorney General started politicizing it, then it became, oh, this is more of Trump's hate.
[00:41:02.991 --> 00:41:05.233]  And they realized they could use that to leverage the midterm.
[00:41:05.853 --> 00:41:15.061]  And so they need that idea that, oh, this brown shirt paramilitary Nazi force, part of the epidemic of non-existent white supremism that they're trying to gen up, just another way to have those optics.
[00:41:16.303 --> 00:41:17.324]  Exactly.
[00:41:17.364 --> 00:41:30.174]  The narrative is that these proud boys are roaming the streets like gorillas just looking for someone to pound, looking for some Muslims or some visible minorities to beat or some trans people and that's completely fictional.
[00:41:30.194 --> 00:41:35.538]  And the truth is you were there, the truth is you were literally there just having a speaking engagement they tried to shut down.
[00:41:36.799 --> 00:41:40.262]  I did a funny comedy set where I was lampooning
[00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:42.261]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:55.171 --> 00:42:03.956]  But outside, they were screaming, follow your leader, 9mm, and all Nazis must die, punch Nazis, terrorizing all the followers.
[00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:15.502]  You know, if these Proud Boys were gay, and it was all about these gay guys who were being terrorized for days, and then- It would have been a national hate movement comes and assaults and does- and death threats these people.
[00:42:17.092 --> 00:42:25.739]  It would be if the Proud Boys were gay, then they would be on t-shirts right now, and people would be going, finally, we're fighting back against the homophobes!
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:33.106]  But because they're patriots, because they're pro-Trump, then all the media lies become real in a court of law.
[00:42:33.306 --> 00:42:35.047]  You know one thing they said in court?
[00:42:35.287 --> 00:42:37.629]  They said, I called Obama a monkey.
[00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.271]  A total fabrication!
[00:42:40.814 --> 00:42:43.057]  Oh, that happened in my custody battle that I ended up winning.
[00:42:43.077 --> 00:42:46.221]  They just showed some random thing on Twitter about David Duke.
[00:42:46.381 --> 00:42:47.182]  I wasn't even involved.
[00:42:47.423 --> 00:42:52.169]  I was five tweets down, somebody else's tweet, and the jury just looked at me and just, it was over.
[00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.051]  But the judge knew it was all BS.
[00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:55.213]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:55.493 --> 00:42:56.094]  Stay right there.
[00:42:56.134 --> 00:42:57.135]  Gavin McGinnis, one more segment.
[00:42:57.155 --> 00:42:58.978]  I don't know where this is all going.
[00:43:02.657 --> 00:43:05.439]  President Trump was sworn in in January of 2017.
[00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:12.703]  The average farm journal and poll had him at about 50% with farmers.
[00:43:13.404 --> 00:43:28.033]  Fast forward to August 2019, two and a half years later, and he's at 79% in the farm journal survey, which is the most respected, and other farm journals show him as high as 90%.
[00:43:29.614 --> 00:43:35.779]  No president since these journals have existed has had numbers this high.
[00:43:36.299 --> 00:43:38.080]  Now why am I so excited about that?
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.261]  Why am I so proud of that?
[00:43:42.003 --> 00:43:43.825]  Farmers got assaulted by the Democrats.
[00:43:47.502 --> 00:43:51.844]  Trump came in and was reasonable about it and said, hey, foreign countries have internal tariffs.
[00:43:51.984 --> 00:43:52.784]  I'll get rid of those.
[00:43:53.244 --> 00:43:57.306]  We don't need all these subsidies, but we'll actually let you compete directly into those markets.
[00:43:58.126 --> 00:44:02.307]  And when China put massive tariffs on U.S.
[00:44:02.347 --> 00:44:05.589]  farmers, their support for Trump only went up.
[00:44:06.049 --> 00:44:11.211]  And then, when China banned a week ago all U.S.
[00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:11.611]  produce
[00:44:13.834 --> 00:44:14.714]  Trump's numbers went up.
[00:44:15.495 --> 00:44:19.377]  Now, I talk about this all the time, but this is the key to everything.
[00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:31.283]  When Americans and free people know they're being dominated and assaulted and bullied, and they know that it's artificial and that it's from outside, they will rally and come together every time.
[00:44:32.644 --> 00:44:36.546]  You know, I harp on this constantly, that these globalists, the Democrats, are bullies.
[00:44:37.614 --> 00:44:53.938]  And they think that if they attack us, and lie about us, and call us Nazis, and physically come after us, and dox our homes, and tell us the American flag sucks, and that America's bad, that somehow we'll become demoralized, and kneel to them, bow to them.
[00:44:55.358 --> 00:44:56.118]  That's not what's happening.
[00:44:57.218 --> 00:45:00.659]  Americans were asleep before, because they thought everything was fine.
[00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:04.111]  Now Americans know that the country's in peril.
[00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:06.453]  And they know that Trump at Infowars is fighting.
[00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:09.355]  And so now they're ready for a war.
[00:45:09.916 --> 00:45:10.957]  They're ready for a battle.
[00:45:11.878 --> 00:45:18.663]  And so when the Chi-Coms come in and say, we're going to put tariffs on your goods, they say, oh, we support Trump more.
[00:45:20.085 --> 00:45:28.312]  And then when they say, we're banning all your food, we're going to all cost each one of your families a large piece of their paycheck, because China imports a lot of food from us they can't produce.
[00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:30.455]  I said, that's fine, go ahead and do that.
[00:45:30.976 --> 00:45:33.177]  Because you've been screwing our industry over forever.
[00:45:33.417 --> 00:45:38.239]  And the farmers get what the Rust Belt and the factories and the workers have gone through.
[00:45:38.259 --> 00:45:39.179]  And they're standing up.
[00:45:39.199 --> 00:45:44.942]  Because farmers have a long history in this country of standing up to tyranny because they understand how the system operates.
[00:45:44.962 --> 00:45:47.583]  And Thomas Jefferson said it'll be the yeoman farmers
[00:45:48.283 --> 00:45:58.189]  That will end up being the heart of this country, and when the country's in crisis, it'll be the farmers, who are close to the ground, and close to the earth, and close to reality, who are going to be the ones to save the nation.
[00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:10.998]  So I'm so proud of America's farmers, for a race, color, and creed, who are the heartland of this nation, and who understand that, hey, you try to intimidate me, you try to bully me, because our president stood up for our industry?
[00:46:11.678 --> 00:46:17.783]  We're ready to take it on the chin in this fight because we understand it's for a greater good.
[00:46:18.203 --> 00:46:25.949]  America had surrendered for 50 years to globalism and deindustrialization and 30 years selling our jobs out to China.
[00:46:26.289 --> 00:46:27.991]  And that surrender is open.
[00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:29.752]  But I'll say this to farmers.
[00:46:30.513 --> 00:46:31.453]  You think you're under attack?
[00:46:31.934 --> 00:46:33.255]  Infowars is under attack as well.
[00:46:33.295 --> 00:46:35.837]  And I notice that it's farming families that really support us.
[00:46:35.857 --> 00:46:36.898]  You're our strongest group.
[00:46:36.918 --> 00:46:39.340]  You understand that we're in the same position you're in.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.661]  You think you've been sanctioned?
[00:46:41.421 --> 00:46:43.103]  They have unleashed hell on us, but you know what?
[00:46:43.403 --> 00:46:55.733]  We're still here because of you, so please, whether it's coffee, or toothpaste, or fish oil, or turmeric, we got great products at great prices at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and your financial support is what keeps us here as well.
[00:46:56.254 --> 00:46:57.755]  So, the globalists have sanctioned us?
[00:46:58.556 --> 00:47:02.019]  That's okay, because the farmers of America are standing with us, and we stand with you.
[00:47:06.422 --> 00:47:09.065]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.862]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:47:26.882 --> 00:47:27.443]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:27.463 --> 00:47:28.464]  Central, I'm here live.
[00:47:28.504 --> 00:47:32.107]  David Knight's on right before me in the morning for the David Knight Show.
[00:47:32.127 --> 00:47:39.114]  Doing a great job, and of course, Owen Schroer and the War Room, Will Johnson's here visiting, sitting in for him, doing an excellent job as well.
[00:47:41.084 --> 00:47:42.265]  I tried to take a bunch of calls yesterday.
[00:47:42.285 --> 00:47:42.605]  I didn't.
[00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:43.486]  I took some.
[00:47:44.066 --> 00:47:51.191]  I had to open the phones up with all this other news and whatever you want to cover and talk about in the next hour into the third and fourth hour.
[00:47:51.951 --> 00:47:55.474]  Joey Gibson, the Patriot Pair Breakfast was there in Portland.
[00:47:55.494 --> 00:48:00.797]  He's going to pop in and give us a report on that and respond to this because this is a real miscarriage of justice.
[00:48:01.318 --> 00:48:03.279]  I followed the buildup, the charges.
[00:48:03.859 --> 00:48:04.480]  I went and watched.
[00:48:05.615 --> 00:48:09.598]  Dozens of videos, because people are coming out of the club after the event.
[00:48:10.299 --> 00:48:13.221]  So there's all these angles of them being followed down the street.
[00:48:13.322 --> 00:48:19.787]  As soon as the police break off in their protective detail, a mob of people attack with clubs and bottles.
[00:48:20.568 --> 00:48:23.911]  And they get their ass kicked because, again, they're meth-head professors.
[00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:28.174]  They are, you know, acid-head devil worshippers.
[00:48:30.136 --> 00:48:33.339]  They are government employees, the bad ones.
[00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:37.056]  And they are also members of the media.
[00:48:37.176 --> 00:48:38.216]  And they come out and wear masks.
[00:48:38.876 --> 00:48:40.316]  And they want to get their bones.
[00:48:40.376 --> 00:48:41.697]  They want to get some blood.
[00:48:41.737 --> 00:48:46.498]  They want to go out there and become real men fighting Nazis.
[00:48:46.578 --> 00:48:48.198]  In fact, I never got to it yesterday.
[00:48:48.218 --> 00:48:49.479]  Maybe we can pull it up.
[00:48:49.639 --> 00:48:56.160]  But the headline was, Democrat fundraiser forced to apologize for simulating Trump's murder.
[00:48:57.221 --> 00:49:02.982]  And it was a bunch of full-grown men dressed up in superhero outfits like they were the Avengers.
[00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:06.553]  Taking on Trump and simulating killing him.
[00:49:08.894 --> 00:49:12.815]  When I was in San Diego, I had some leftist walk by my table, bow up and think about saying something.
[00:49:12.835 --> 00:49:20.917]  He was like a 60-year-old man, wearing a Deadpool shirt, saying, with an arrow to himself, saying, I've got issues.
[00:49:21.338 --> 00:49:25.579]  Hey, dude, because you're wearing a Deadpool shirt doesn't mean you're the fictional character.
[00:49:27.048 --> 00:49:29.230]  All you're going to get is your neck broken if you put your hands on me.
[00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:31.372]  But these people live in fantasy land.
[00:49:31.712 --> 00:49:39.139]  And so, they're letting you know in these jurisdictions, we're going to follow you, we're going to attack you, and then our jurisdiction's going to put you in prison.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:49.508]  When groups that say they want to kill the police and have attacked ICE facilities and the Dayton shooter, all of it, and the guy in Texas, Antifa, they changed all his pages.
[00:49:50.188 --> 00:49:51.890]  They got that hoax over on us.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.682]  So, Gavin McGinnis joins us, uh, hosting his own program.
[00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:58.884]  He's been banned everywhere like us, except on his own platform.
[00:49:58.904 --> 00:49:59.885]  We'll tell you how to go there in a moment.
[00:50:00.145 --> 00:50:02.166]  Because remember, the internet's still alive, it's still here.
[00:50:02.407 --> 00:50:04.888]  We have to decentralize it, as Drudge has warned.
[00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.189]  And it's starting to happen.
[00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:21.080]  Uh, but, a lot of my crews are really upset, they're really threatened by this, because to see the injustice, to see people hounded, and bullied, and attacked, and then convicted by this servile jury, it really shows you, in these leftist jurisdictions, you cannot get justice.
[00:50:24.249 --> 00:50:25.229]  So where's it going, Gavin?
[00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.350]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:50:31.451 --> 00:50:32.911]  The opposite is always true.
[00:50:33.071 --> 00:50:33.551]  You know what I mean?
[00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:35.992]  Like they say, we're anti-fascists, right?
[00:50:36.392 --> 00:50:37.712]  And we're against the government.
[00:50:38.173 --> 00:50:42.694]  And we're going to go fight these fascists because they're Nazis, because they're full of hate.
[00:50:43.054 --> 00:50:44.814]  And you go, OK, that sounds good to me.
[00:50:45.034 --> 00:50:45.894]  Fight some Nazis.
[00:50:45.934 --> 00:50:46.695]  That sounds great.
[00:50:47.035 --> 00:50:47.955]  But what really happened?
[00:50:48.442 --> 00:50:51.952]  The Antifa is the paramilitary wing of the DNC.
[00:50:52.212 --> 00:50:53.476]  They are the government.
[00:50:53.797 --> 00:50:55.361]  They are the establishment.
[00:50:55.988 --> 00:51:03.531]  And they say, okay, go attack these Trump supporters, call them Nazis or whatever you have to do, and we'll let you get away with it scot-free.
[00:51:03.912 --> 00:51:06.633]  So they assault everyone, no problems for Antifa.
[00:51:06.973 --> 00:51:12.736]  Somehow they magically get lawyers, no media attention at all for the Antifa that attacked that guy.
[00:51:13.356 --> 00:51:19.058]  And then they take this alleged Nazis, the Trump supporters, and charge them with 15 years.
[00:51:19.078 --> 00:51:21.480]  I mean, they haven't been sentenced yet, but they're facing 15 years
[00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.711]  for defending themselves against a mob.
[00:51:26.171 --> 00:51:31.193]  So the fascists, the tyranny is the left in this case.
[00:51:31.513 --> 00:51:36.135]  And the patriots, the guys supporting the president, they're the ones being treated like anarchists.
[00:51:36.155 --> 00:51:38.335]  They're the ones being treated like Guy Fawkes.
[00:51:38.415 --> 00:51:42.837]  And, you know, we've got this one of the guys, John, he's got four black kids.
[00:51:42.937 --> 00:51:43.957]  His wife's black.
[00:51:44.638 --> 00:51:46.158]  And he's going to go to jail.
[00:51:46.178 --> 00:51:49.619]  So these four black kids lose a father for 15 years.
[00:51:49.699 --> 00:51:51.680]  Basically, the only years you need a father.
[00:51:52.253 --> 00:51:54.213]  Because of a lie.
[00:51:54.614 --> 00:51:56.494]  A myth that the DNC is pushing.
[00:51:56.774 --> 00:51:58.694]  And one other thing I wanted to add in there, Alex.
[00:51:58.934 --> 00:52:00.955]  You're listing that they're all rich kids and professors' kids.
[00:52:01.315 --> 00:52:02.815]  There's another group of Antifa.
[00:52:03.195 --> 00:52:06.716]  The mentally weak, the vulnerable.
[00:52:07.476 --> 00:52:12.137]  Antifa and the DNC and these globalists, they prey on weak-minded men.
[00:52:12.377 --> 00:52:15.838]  Like Finbar Slonim, his father had just committed suicide.
[00:52:16.209 --> 00:52:23.091]  Two years earlier, he was a red carpet guy, and that's not, that's a young man's game now, so he got depressed and killed himself.
[00:52:23.451 --> 00:52:28.772]  They see Finbar, they see him, you know, fatherless and weak, and they go, come on into our family.
[00:52:29.052 --> 00:52:32.933]  All you'll have to do is commit some violence, and you can repay the group.
[00:52:33.573 --> 00:52:35.814]  It's really some, it's like a sick cult.
[00:52:36.774 --> 00:52:40.295]  Well, what it is is a violent street gang, like the Brown Shirts,
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.783]  And they actually worked for someone who was working for Hitler in the day of the brown shirts, George Soros.
[00:52:46.863 --> 00:53:00.011]  I mean, you cannot make up that their main financier made his first money working for the Nazis as a bloodhound, is what they called him, a Jew that would go find hidden Jews and convince them to then set them up and send them to death camps.
[00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:05.054]  And Soros says on 60 Minutes, the best time of his life, he said, I had happy making
[00:53:05.894 --> 00:53:09.878]  And he's not sad for what he did, and then I'm the Nazi.
[00:53:09.998 --> 00:53:11.540]  It's total mental illness.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.100]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:21.790]  At this event with Trump, where they simulated killing Trump at this Democrat event, again, they were dressed up like Captain America battling Red Skull.
[00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:23.431]  I've said that a hundred times.
[00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:25.954]  They think they're Captain America battling Red Skull.
[00:53:25.994 --> 00:53:27.055]  These people are crazy.
[00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.931]  You know, they call Soros a Holocaust survivor for those years.
[00:53:31.971 --> 00:53:34.792]  The media spin with that whole story is just incredible.
[00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:35.992]  He's an atheist.
[00:53:36.272 --> 00:53:37.353]  He hates all religion.
[00:53:37.493 --> 00:53:38.733]  That includes Judaism.
[00:53:38.813 --> 00:53:39.854]  That includes Christianity.
[00:53:40.134 --> 00:53:41.814]  His father was an atheist.
[00:53:41.834 --> 00:53:44.155]  His father hated Judaism and hated Christianity.
[00:53:44.175 --> 00:53:47.096]  You're not Jewish if you hate Judaism.
[00:53:47.475 --> 00:53:50.337]  So this has nothing to do with anti-semitism.
[00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:52.258]  This has to do with a man who worked with the Nazis.
[00:53:52.618 --> 00:54:02.663]  But I think because we're intellectually lazy, we're mentally obese these days, that we're easy prey for these propagandists who just make up basically any story they want.
[00:54:02.923 --> 00:54:04.684]  They vilify anyone they want.
[00:54:05.125 --> 00:54:05.905]  And it works!
[00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:08.947]  And it doesn't just work in the court of public opinion.
[00:54:09.287 --> 00:54:11.608]  It works in actual criminal court!
[00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:15.770]  And again, you're a really nice guy.
[00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:16.571]  You're a famous
[00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:22.376]  He's a kind of culture guy, famous, I'd call you kind of classical liberal or libertarian.
[00:54:22.696 --> 00:54:28.063]  That's what the left really wants you banned is because you've been so popular and launched a lot of movements, launched vice, done a lot of other things.
[00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:30.852]  But they love just projecting this lie.
[00:54:30.872 --> 00:54:32.773]  So you come on my show and you go, we're not Nazis.
[00:54:33.033 --> 00:54:34.674]  We're just into being proud of America.
[00:54:34.714 --> 00:54:38.956]  And of course, my audience knows that, Gavin McInnes.
[00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:41.157]  But the larger issue is they're not going to stop.
[00:54:41.417 --> 00:54:47.961]  The New York Times has announced, well, it leaked, that they're going to basically try to start a race war pivoting off of the Russia hoax.
[00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:49.942]  This is all very, very cold blooded.
[00:54:50.242 --> 00:54:53.285]  How do we respond to a group trying to cause a race war?
[00:54:53.305 --> 00:54:57.789]  I think we point out they're the social engineers creating the racism as poverty pimps.
[00:54:57.809 --> 00:55:04.495]  I mean, these are really, really... Talking about comic books, these are like comic book villains.
[00:55:06.157 --> 00:55:07.058]  We just keep fighting.
[00:55:07.748 --> 00:55:09.030]  You know, we've been through worse.
[00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:10.532]  We've been through the Civil War.
[00:55:10.892 --> 00:55:12.494]  We've been through the American Revolution.
[00:55:12.915 --> 00:55:16.700]  We've been through Vietnam totally polarized America.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.242]  And we fought through that.
[00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:21.706]  And truth, you know, the pendulum swings both ways.
[00:55:21.806 --> 00:55:23.408]  And I think truth is on its way back.
[00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:24.690]  These propagandists
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.180]  have no plan.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.901]  They say no border, no wall, no USA at all.
[00:55:30.201 --> 00:55:35.843]  And I even heard a chant the other day that said, from Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go.
[00:55:36.343 --> 00:55:39.544]  So they don't want any borders at all in the entire world.
[00:55:40.004 --> 00:55:46.385]  An idea like that, much like fascism, by the way, can't gain any serious traction.
[00:55:46.765 --> 00:55:52.087]  The Nazis couldn't have lasted, and these people won't last, because tyrannical
[00:55:53.889 --> 00:55:56.496]  Orthodoxy, tyranny doesn't last.
[00:55:56.877 --> 00:55:57.719]  Freedom lasts.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:58.601]  That's right.
[00:55:59.383 --> 00:56:01.949]  Gavin, where do folks find your great daily programs?
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.342]  They find me at freespeech.tv.
[00:56:05.663 --> 00:56:09.186]  I'll be announcing, we're going to have to crowdfund for an appeal for these guys.
[00:56:09.226 --> 00:56:12.289]  There's still another one by the way, but he's East Indian.
[00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:13.150]  He's brown.
[00:56:13.691 --> 00:56:15.373]  So that's not helping their narrative.
[00:56:15.413 --> 00:56:18.155]  So that one's delayed until December or something.
[00:56:18.456 --> 00:56:20.578]  But we have to fight for an appeal for these guys.
[00:56:20.858 --> 00:56:25.383]  It's just very difficult to set up a crowdfund because these Antifa wasps
[00:56:25.743 --> 00:56:28.384]  Swarm everything you do and constantly shut it down.
[00:56:28.424 --> 00:56:35.647]  So every payment system has to have 10 different layers and offshore accounts and whatever just to raise money for legal representation.
[00:56:35.667 --> 00:56:35.827]  Exactly.
[00:56:35.887 --> 00:56:41.349]  I don't think the listeners and viewers out there realizes we're not whiners just how much attack we're under because we are the resistance.
[00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:42.870]  Gavin McGinnis, thank you so much.
[00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:43.450]  Talk to you soon.
[00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:44.931]  Thanks for having me.
[00:56:45.531 --> 00:56:46.031]  Great guy.
[00:56:46.171 --> 00:56:46.772]  These terrible
[00:56:48.527 --> 00:56:54.210]  Terrible things are happening around the country and around the world to persecute nationalists because we're winning, and we're going to win in the end.
[00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.971]  But please, you heard what he was just talking about.
[00:56:57.272 --> 00:56:58.212]  I've got major lawsuits.
[00:56:58.232 --> 00:57:00.093]  We've got a file to counter these people.
[00:57:01.114 --> 00:57:07.217]  I want to just keep operating, so I'm trying to expand in the face of the globalists going into 2020, and we're successfully reaching out to folks.
[00:57:07.817 --> 00:57:09.958]  Thanks to you spreading the word about the articles and the videos.
[00:57:10.238 --> 00:57:11.499]  Thanks to Matt Drudge linking to them.
[00:57:12.099 --> 00:57:13.640]  Thanks to folks supporting our local stations.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.402]  But seriously, we're going to have to end this extended sale.
[00:57:17.222 --> 00:57:20.510]  Uh, this World Awakens sale, that's almost every item at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.594]  All the supplements, 50-60% off.
[00:57:23.035 --> 00:57:24.057]  And a bunch of other big deals.
[00:57:24.077 --> 00:57:25.420]  We've gotta end it in a couple days.
[00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:27.826]  We've extended it, but a lot of things are about to sell out.
[00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.092]  But it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[00:57:32.112 --> 00:57:34.154]  So please, please check it all out.
[00:57:34.314 --> 00:57:39.799]  And the new documentary, available on DVD, so that it's not digital, so that you have an archive of it.
[00:57:40.159 --> 00:57:41.300]  That's so important these days.
[00:57:41.701 --> 00:57:43.943]  It's now available exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:57:44.343 --> 00:57:45.164]  All-new documentary.
[00:57:45.304 --> 00:57:48.567]  You can't watch this with Gorse Truly, Gab McGinnis, and so many others.
[00:57:48.927 --> 00:57:49.527]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.547 --> 00:57:49.868]  Stay with us.
[00:57:54.488 --> 00:57:57.250]  So let's go to Allen from Ohio.
[00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.051]  He wants to talk about DNA Force.
[00:57:59.231 --> 00:58:00.051]  Hi, can you hear me?
[00:58:00.231 --> 00:58:01.032]  Yes, loud and clear.
[00:58:01.212 --> 00:58:01.632]  Oh, good.
[00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:03.273]  It's an honor to talk to you guys.
[00:58:03.393 --> 00:58:04.414]  I don't miss the broadcast.
[00:58:04.474 --> 00:58:06.035]  So DNA Force, okay.
[00:58:06.135 --> 00:58:09.537]  I broke my neck 16 years ago, you know, in a skiing accident.
[00:58:09.697 --> 00:58:15.981]  I was paralyzed from the neck down only for a short period of time, like the first hour after the, you know, after the accident.
[00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:19.863]  But I experienced that and I have a knife hardware in my neck.
[00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:20.784]  Multiple plate.
[00:58:20.924 --> 00:58:23.745]  And anyway, it did all right for like 12, 13 years.
[00:58:23.785 --> 00:58:30.569]  And about two years ago, I started having the most incredible nerve pain down my arms, especially my left arm pulsing.
[00:58:30.629 --> 00:58:31.910]  And you can't imagine the pain.
[00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:33.431]  It was like I had rebroke my neck.
[00:58:33.491 --> 00:58:36.633]  I went and got MRI to see if my heart rate was okay.
[00:58:36.673 --> 00:58:40.055]  And this whole process of seeing a doctor and everything took a month or two.
[00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:42.597]  And they scheduled me for these pain shots.
[00:58:42.677 --> 00:58:43.997]  They were just going to deaden the nerve.
[00:58:44.118 --> 00:58:45.058]  It was so painful.
[00:58:45.238 --> 00:58:45.979]  I couldn't take it.
[00:58:46.159 --> 00:58:47.720]  So anyway, I was waiting for my shots.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.140]  I missed
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.221]  Yeah, I ordered them once, so I scheduled them again for a month later.
[00:58:50.262 --> 00:58:55.545]  I ordered DNA Force, and I started taking it, and I was taking 25 a leave a day.
[00:58:55.705 --> 00:58:57.127]  Five, five times a day.
[00:58:57.227 --> 00:59:01.930]  And I was wearing a neck brace for the first year of this, like, two years of pain every day.
[00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:07.254]  But I started taking DNA Force, and within two weeks, I started thinking, I don't need a leave anymore.
[00:59:08.695 --> 00:59:09.316]  That is amazing.
[00:59:09.336 --> 00:59:10.136]  That is amazing.
[00:59:25.472 --> 00:59:25.972]  You know what?
[00:59:25.993 --> 00:59:30.897]  When I talk about the products, that's one of the things I've always focused on is how well they work.
[00:59:31.077 --> 00:59:33.540]  You know, they actually, they actually work.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:38.064]  It's not something that, you know, let's get it and just, you know, take it and whatever, hope for the best.
[00:59:38.204 --> 00:59:39.765]  I mean, they actually work.
[00:59:39.966 --> 00:59:41.287]  And hey, thank you for the call.
[00:59:41.507 --> 00:59:46.552]  And because of people like you, the reason why Harrison and myself get to sit here today.
[00:59:57.073 --> 01:00:03.174]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:09.956 --> 01:00:11.196]  Okay, here's what's going to happen.
[01:00:12.356 --> 01:00:14.377]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.117]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.637 --> 01:00:22.979]  We're going to wage war on corruption, and I'm going to take a bunch of your calls, bam, bam, bam, this hour, so folks are going to have to hold an hour.
[01:00:24.005 --> 01:00:31.532]  For this hour and the next, we're going to take calls on the fluoride and the big studies admitting it lowers IQs, particularly in males.
[01:00:32.052 --> 01:00:32.813]  Causes cancer.
[01:00:33.894 --> 01:00:37.958]  Also, the runoffs causing horny, confused cane toads to rape pythons.
[01:00:38.478 --> 01:00:39.099]  Gang rape them.
[01:00:39.939 --> 01:00:40.700]  I'm not joking.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.702]  We're going to show you the video of the gang raping.
[01:00:44.363 --> 01:00:46.065]  So much is coming up this hour.
[01:00:46.205 --> 01:00:47.506]  We've got Elizabeth Warren's apology.
[01:00:47.526 --> 01:00:49.888]  We've got that insane press conference last night with Tlaib.
[01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:51.812]  I want everything free!
[01:00:51.852 --> 01:00:54.433]  My mother just couldn't come to Israel and get free health care!
[01:00:54.593 --> 01:00:55.334]  Or my grandmother!
[01:00:55.594 --> 01:00:56.014]  Mommy!
[01:00:56.054 --> 01:00:56.334]  Mommy!
[01:00:56.554 --> 01:01:01.257]  I want to overthrow Israel and kill all the Jews, but give me free health care!
[01:01:02.738 --> 01:01:03.518]  It's over the top.
[01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:05.819]  So that's all coming up too.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:10.022]  I'll give the number out next segment, but here is a report detailing a lot of this.
[01:01:11.062 --> 01:01:15.085]  A New York Times to reframe American values in order to launch a race war.
[01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:15.385]  Here it is.
[01:01:16.052 --> 01:01:23.982]  Help us understand the genesis of this, how long you've been thinking about this, how long you've been thinking about changing our notions of the start of this country, moving it from 1776 to 1619.
[01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:31.564]  So I first came across the year, the date, 1619, as a high school student.
[01:01:32.104 --> 01:01:35.548]  And I came across it in a book called Before the Mayflower.
[01:01:35.868 --> 01:01:37.730]  And I just remembered as a student being astounded.
[01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.012]  Yeah, don't tell us about the Muslims.
[01:01:39.032 --> 01:01:39.973]  Still running it.
[01:01:39.993 --> 01:01:40.894]  For teaching us how.
[01:01:40.934 --> 01:01:45.699]  That people of African descent had been here even before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.
[01:01:45.999 --> 01:01:47.240]  So I've been obsessed with that.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:47.861]  That's not even true.
[01:01:47.881 --> 01:01:48.602]  It was in Spanish.
[01:01:48.942 --> 01:01:50.564]  They were in the Caribbean.
[01:01:50.584 --> 01:01:51.885]  Gotta kick America around some more.
[01:01:51.905 --> 01:01:52.786]  The whole world had slavery then!
[01:02:09.822 --> 01:02:15.325]  We look at the New York Times, and we look at all CNN, MSNBC, and they're just up there.
[01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:16.906]  This is a white supremacist.
[01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:21.448]  When he lowered flags because of the shooting in El Paso, it was to heil Hitler.
[01:02:21.849 --> 01:02:23.049]  And you're just like, this doesn't make sense.
[01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.511]  It's targeting the dumbest people in the country.
[01:02:26.991 --> 01:02:36.577]  And it's also creating hysteria where people think that if they don't jump on board with whatever the Democrats say, they're going to be called racist.
[01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:38.878]  That's the new religion.
[01:02:40.253 --> 01:02:45.295]  That's the system of bullying that these people are inducting everyone into.
[01:02:45.395 --> 01:03:01.861]  When someone is dividing the country with racist rhetoric and saying things that are causing people to literally anger up and get into fights and act crazy, and he's giving people a license to hate, you gotta call it out.
[01:03:01.881 --> 01:03:03.321]  Otherwise, what are you doing here?
[01:03:03.521 --> 01:03:05.662]  I think there are a lot of people in
[01:03:08.723 --> 01:03:17.107]  The Republican base and Trump's base and Fox News' base that have a visceral reaction to the color of my scans.
[01:03:17.187 --> 01:03:21.208]  You don't get to say I'm for racial equality and all these good things.
[01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:25.350]  I disagree with him there, but I like his economic views.
[01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.990]  I'm going to vote for him.
[01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.731]  No, you own it.
[01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:29.632]  You own the blood that happens.
[01:03:30.012 --> 01:03:33.055]  It used to be, well, we're against illegal immigration, but we're for legal immigration.
[01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.556]  That was the party's historical stance.
[01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:39.501]  Now, it looks increasingly like, under Donald Trump, the Republican Party is hostile towards all immigrants.
[01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:49.985]  If you are supporting a president that is caging brown babies, and you are okay with that, then I'm sorry, that is supporting racist policies.
[01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:54.247]  And that is not distinct from supporting a racist president.
[01:03:54.447 --> 01:04:04.771]  Trump came out and lashed out at the New York Times, claiming it's going on a racism witch hunt now that the Russiagate has failed.
[01:04:06.131 --> 01:04:06.992]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.081]  That's not what he claims.
[01:04:10.341 --> 01:04:12.561]  That's what they say.
[01:04:13.442 --> 01:04:15.462]  But Slate Magazine is who got it.
[01:04:16.903 --> 01:04:20.444]  And you read the transcript, it is unbelievable.
[01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:26.906]  The head of the New York Times says to the employees, look, Russia didn't work.
[01:04:28.087 --> 01:04:29.127]  He came up flat-footed.
[01:04:29.147 --> 01:04:29.767]  These are quotes.
[01:04:30.568 --> 01:04:34.689]  We're pivoting to race to remove him from office.
[01:04:36.303 --> 01:04:37.704]  They're the ones bringing up race.
[01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.046]  They're the ones lying.
[01:04:39.086 --> 01:04:39.966]  They're the ones dividing.
[01:04:40.267 --> 01:04:42.389]  They're the ones doing all of this.
[01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:52.658]  And then they've got the nerve to act like it's Trump when he's done nothing but prison reform to get black people out of jail and tried to bring factories to the inner city.
[01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:55.040]  But it's beyond a racism witch hunt.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.002]  They're trying to invoke a civil war.
[01:04:59.204 --> 01:04:59.645]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.685 --> 01:05:00.926]  Critical Intel straight ahead.
[01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.775]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:05:10.596 --> 01:05:13.758]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:05:14.639 --> 01:05:15.620]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.424]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:05:23.366 --> 01:05:26.329]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:05:26.409 --> 01:05:27.550]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:05:28.639 --> 01:05:32.122]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:05:32.222 --> 01:05:38.967]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:05:43.551 --> 01:05:47.014]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.401]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:00.146]  You can't watch this.
[01:06:00.466 --> 01:06:00.926]  The movie.
[01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:03.228]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:03.288 --> 01:06:14.377]  I am burning inside.
[01:06:14.817 --> 01:06:17.339]  Burning with the fire of liberty.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:23.264]  Burning with the desire to touch the stars.
[01:06:23.384 --> 01:06:27.707]  I come to you from the front lines.
[01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:33.406]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.466 --> 01:06:36.847]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:45.430]  A new world order.
[01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:52.033]  A new world order.
[01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.353]  A new world order.
[01:07:07.782 --> 01:07:17.312]  As I sit here on this live Tuesday, August 20th, 2019 Global Transmission, I have the 1974 blueprint.
[01:07:18.753 --> 01:07:30.665]  A PhD and above battle plan that was adopted on a planetary scale by the forces of the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:07:32.443 --> 01:07:34.564]  Now, that's the corporate designation.
[01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:39.845]  It has nothing to do with white people in the main, but it is a racist, anti-human project.
[01:07:42.006 --> 01:07:58.411]  And so, when you read a book written by the later White House science czar of Barack Hussein Obama, John P. Holdren, with Paul Ehrlich and Annie Ehrlich, and you read about all their statements about forcibly depopulating the world,
[01:07:59.807 --> 01:08:04.911]  And now, compounds like fluoride should be used to reduce fertility.
[01:08:05.131 --> 01:08:09.454]  That's sterilized, statistically, in the main.
[01:08:11.035 --> 01:08:11.695]  Reduce fertility.
[01:08:12.416 --> 01:08:12.976]  Reduce yields.
[01:08:14.657 --> 01:08:15.278]  And then what else?
[01:08:16.879 --> 01:08:22.202]  Lower IQ and increase morbidity.
[01:08:24.164 --> 01:08:26.725]  You know, when you have rictimortus.
[01:08:28.715 --> 01:08:29.896]  When you're bye-bye.
[01:08:29.916 --> 01:08:32.838]  We're going to get to this in just a moment.
[01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:37.522]  What you see on screen of your radio listener, you probably want to go in and read the toothpaste in your house.
[01:08:38.703 --> 01:08:39.523]  If you're a new listener.
[01:08:40.224 --> 01:08:51.172]  And it's got a warning saying if you ingest more than a pea-sized amount of this, call poison control immediately.
[01:08:51.973 --> 01:08:55.295]  These things must be done delicately, my little friend.
[01:08:55.316 --> 01:08:58.038]  And I'll get you and your little kids, too.
[01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:05.952]  So, the eugenicists call the general public bad sons.
[01:09:07.092 --> 01:09:09.273]  Bad sons, you've got a crepe myrtle or an oak tree.
[01:09:10.794 --> 01:09:12.975]  Actually, the tree itself's roots throw up more.
[01:09:13.835 --> 01:09:15.736]  But maybe you don't want a bunch of trees.
[01:09:16.116 --> 01:09:17.757]  You just want to have pretty trees.
[01:09:18.157 --> 01:09:19.757]  Well, you go pull up the bad sons.
[01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:23.359]  So, real eugenics isn't trying to improve the race.
[01:09:24.339 --> 01:09:30.142]  That's a parlor, or porch, or outer room.
[01:09:31.344 --> 01:09:34.046]  To recruit the low-level dumbbells to support it.
[01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:36.227]  Oh, our movement's to help people!
[01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:43.331]  And all it is is a science project of the Illuminati, which is a real organization, a real group.
[01:09:43.451 --> 01:09:47.593]  Check your encyclopedia, you'll probably think, oh wow, type in George Washington letters on the Illuminati.
[01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:48.774]  Now he was battling it.
[01:09:50.235 --> 01:09:57.579]  Oh, you didn't know he wrote like dozens of letters on the Illuminati and Luciferian organizations that his Masonic Order was battling?
[01:09:58.655 --> 01:10:08.502]  It's not true that all the masons serve Lucifer, but a movement that's taken over masonry, in many respects, when you become 33rd degree, you learn all the secrets of Lucifer.
[01:10:09.883 --> 01:10:17.108]  And I made no secret of the fact that my family's founding members of Texas, and some of them were 33rd degree, but they were Christians.
[01:10:18.049 --> 01:10:20.971]  And those are not the secrets you learn from those orders.
[01:10:21.511 --> 01:10:22.312]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:23.092 --> 01:10:25.514]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:29.332 --> 01:10:46.275]  Here we are, with everybody calling me and just freaking out, going, oh my gosh, the Journal of American Medicine and Harvard, they all just came out, and they said, take the floor out of the water, it's causing massive brain damage, massive infertility, just, it's devastating black people.
[01:10:48.915 --> 01:10:51.696]  And yes, we're all different, we're all similar, but we're all different.
[01:10:54.136 --> 01:10:57.237]  And males have blood-brain barriers,
[01:10:58.829 --> 01:11:00.389]  Up to 70% weaker than women's.
[01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:01.770]  On general it's about half.
[01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:03.530]  I've got all the studies I'll show you right here.
[01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:05.731]  And women have much stronger blood-brain barriers.
[01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:08.792]  Because of what chemically goes on in their body.
[01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:10.292]  Men and women are different.
[01:11:10.312 --> 01:11:13.693]  But black males, just type in blacks and fluoride.
[01:11:14.753 --> 01:11:16.674]  Blacks suffer most from fluoride.
[01:11:18.494 --> 01:11:21.155]  And that's the new American with a big link to studies.
[01:11:22.995 --> 01:11:24.256]  But let me explain something.
[01:11:25.216 --> 01:11:28.317]  That's at 1.3 parts per million.
[01:11:29.261 --> 01:11:30.282]  Little over one part per million.
[01:11:31.142 --> 01:11:48.335]  If you ingest the powdered eggs they were serving until the 60s in federal prisons and on chain gangs, they were up to 600 parts per million being fed to prisoners.
[01:11:51.317 --> 01:11:52.198]  Might want to learn about that.
[01:11:52.779 --> 01:11:58.343]  Now, at that level, ladies and gentlemen, you're talking shutdown of the brain, fertility's fried,
[01:11:59.926 --> 01:12:03.607]  You might as well dip your testicles into acid.
[01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:05.848]  Might as well blow your head off at that point.
[01:12:07.168 --> 01:12:21.212]  Now, if you look at what's in Crest for children, all of these, it's not even listed what parts per million, because the fluoride is in the parts per hundred.
[01:12:21.232 --> 01:12:24.413]  It's so high that one of the main ingredients is fluoride.
[01:12:25.546 --> 01:12:29.249]  Hydrofluorosilic and it all tastes like candy for children.
[01:12:29.589 --> 01:12:31.070]  You've got Mickey Mouse on the front.
[01:12:32.451 --> 01:12:33.192]  That's what your kid's into.
[01:12:33.352 --> 01:12:39.857]  Oh, be a little mermaid who drools and is so stupid and has her whole future taken away from her.
[01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:41.779]  It's all meant so your kids eat it.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.062]  Oh, and maybe your son's into velociraptors.
[01:12:46.102 --> 01:12:46.943]  They think those are cute.
[01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:53.468]  And all these R's like the VC would put like a cool doll or a cool ring or a cool samurai sword.
[01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:58.952]  The Japanese did this in Island Warfare as well, and you know, somebody that wasn't listening would go, oh, that's a cool-looking sword!
[01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:05.835]  You pull it... Well, the kid sees it and is like, oh, mom, I want the... This has got... Mickey Mouse on it!
[01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:07.576]  Oh, look, mommy!
[01:13:08.256 --> 01:13:09.217]  Fluoride Act!
[01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:12.098]  Oh, fluoride!
[01:13:12.338 --> 01:13:13.600]  Oh, it's all so good!
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.822]  Oh, smart rinse.
[01:13:16.002 --> 01:13:16.643]  That's a big joke.
[01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:19.547]  You're gonna be real smart once we rinse your brain with this.
[01:13:20.027 --> 01:13:24.232]  So at 1.3 parts per million, I'm gonna show you mainstream studies right now that everybody's freaking out over.
[01:13:24.793 --> 01:13:26.955]  They're exactly what all the other studies showed 100 years ago.
[01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:28.657]  Say it again.
[01:13:29.077 --> 01:13:31.120]  The Nazis used it in death camps.
[01:13:33.851 --> 01:13:35.532]  That's in Pulitzer Prize winning books.
[01:13:35.552 --> 01:13:36.532]  But hell, why listen to that?
[01:13:36.572 --> 01:13:41.734]  I've got the science czar saying increase it in our water to lower our IQs and dumb us down.
[01:13:43.014 --> 01:13:43.354]  Look it up.
[01:13:43.494 --> 01:13:44.134]  Ecoscience.
[01:13:44.515 --> 01:13:46.315]  Call for sterilization agents in water.
[01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:47.436]  Fluoride's the chief.
[01:13:49.976 --> 01:13:50.717]  Might want to read it.
[01:13:50.737 --> 01:13:55.778]  You know, it's the owner's manual to screw up your life and make sure you're not a player in the future by dumbing you down.
[01:13:56.879 --> 01:13:58.079]  They don't want you making decisions.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:00.360]  Now,
[01:14:02.315 --> 01:14:04.556]  We know the education system is designed to dumb you down.
[01:14:05.336 --> 01:14:06.616]  It's social control.
[01:14:07.256 --> 01:14:09.297]  So here's the studies, but let me hit some of these first.
[01:14:11.017 --> 01:14:11.117]  U.S.
[01:14:11.137 --> 01:14:13.438]  military pondered love not war.
[01:14:13.498 --> 01:14:20.460]  BBC spraying chemicals on men to make them be attracted to the opposite sex.
[01:14:22.341 --> 01:14:23.361]  No, that's not what the headline is.
[01:14:24.041 --> 01:14:25.061]  I'm adding a Freudian slip.
[01:14:26.502 --> 01:14:27.222]  To the same sex.
[01:14:28.851 --> 01:14:29.572]  Now think about that.
[01:14:30.193 --> 01:14:30.754]  How do you do that?
[01:14:30.794 --> 01:14:32.716]  Well a lot of the sex is off olfactory nerves.
[01:14:33.377 --> 01:14:35.881]  It's off smell and other things that go on.
[01:14:37.843 --> 01:14:38.384]  Now let's continue.
[01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:39.105]  That's BBC.
[01:14:39.125 --> 01:14:39.746]  Doesn't exist though.
[01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:40.687]  They say Jones is crazy.
[01:14:40.947 --> 01:14:41.809]  Says it was a gay bomb.
[01:14:42.289 --> 01:14:42.490]  U.S.
[01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:44.512]  military once proposed gay bomb.
[01:14:45.053 --> 01:14:45.494]  Gizmodo.
[01:14:48.074 --> 01:15:05.098]  So, when we come back, I'll get the number out to open the phones up, but I wanted to show Forbes saying I'm a big liar, it's all good for you, and the new studies, here's Reuters, study prompts call for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women, saying it lowers IQ, particularly in boys.
[01:15:06.819 --> 01:15:08.099]  Well, who needs that IQ?
[01:15:09.279 --> 01:15:11.380]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.200]  From JAMA, the most prestigious one.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.061]  Study links fluorinated water during pregnancy, and it's conclusive.
[01:15:19.401 --> 01:15:22.922]  But then I've got the Mexican studies, the Chinese studies.
[01:15:24.622 --> 01:15:27.243]  I've got the frogs from the Atrazine now raping snakes.
[01:15:27.763 --> 01:15:28.683]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[01:15:28.723 --> 01:15:29.583]  I'm not joking.
[01:15:30.603 --> 01:15:31.403]  Truth, strange and fiction.
[01:15:32.664 --> 01:15:36.484]  But I wanted to show you when they say, oh, well, the babies need it for their teeth.
[01:15:36.524 --> 01:15:40.845]  No, actually, ingesting fluoride of just the regular types, tossing it up.
[01:15:41.874 --> 01:15:44.517]  Calcium fluoride, but hydrofluorosilicic weaponized.
[01:15:44.597 --> 01:15:45.798]  It's charged up acid.
[01:15:46.338 --> 01:15:48.340]  It bounces around the nerves better.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.601]  You know, acid eats through things.
[01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:51.203]  So it just eats, eats, eats, eats.
[01:15:51.223 --> 01:15:55.307]  The elite just watch your eyes dim and they sit back.
[01:15:55.327 --> 01:15:59.270]  The hardcore evil that will wait till I tell you how they trick your kids to eat it.
[01:16:02.413 --> 01:16:02.894]  Craneleaf.
[01:16:06.783 --> 01:16:08.245]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[01:16:08.265 --> 01:16:09.026]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[01:16:09.046 --> 01:16:09.507]  You're on the air.
[01:16:09.627 --> 01:16:10.148]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:10.248 --> 01:16:14.273]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[01:16:14.373 --> 01:16:16.837]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[01:16:16.877 --> 01:16:18.539]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[01:16:18.599 --> 01:16:22.144]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[01:16:22.264 --> 01:16:23.485]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:23.945]  Exactly.
[01:16:23.965 --> 01:16:24.966]  We're all kindred spirits.
[01:16:25.126 --> 01:16:25.706]  We really are.
[01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:26.226]  We really are.
[01:16:26.266 --> 01:16:27.827]  Listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[01:16:27.847 --> 01:16:30.509]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:32.970]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:34.051]  What would you recommend?
[01:16:34.071 --> 01:16:36.872]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[01:16:36.932 --> 01:16:38.733]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[01:16:38.753 --> 01:16:42.195]  You know, I think X2 or X3 because that's a building block to everything.
[01:16:42.215 --> 01:16:43.976]  And if you don't have that, the bad halogens take over.
[01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.237]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:16:46.297 --> 01:16:47.558]  Turmeric is amazing.
[01:16:47.598 --> 01:16:49.099]  This is a very strong extract.
[01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:50.239]  One of the strongest out there.
[01:16:50.259 --> 01:16:51.040]  Probably the strongest.
[01:16:53.848 --> 01:16:56.210]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:16:56.370 --> 01:17:00.352]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[01:17:00.452 --> 01:17:13.261]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:21.326]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:22.007]  That's it.
[01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:23.488]  Because I would, I'm gonna explain this again.
[01:17:23.928 --> 01:17:25.250]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:27.012]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[01:17:27.652 --> 01:17:28.954]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:17:28.994 --> 01:17:30.075]  You've got my total commitment.
[01:17:30.315 --> 01:17:33.038]  Anything I do, information, any of it.
[01:17:33.339 --> 01:17:37.303]  Products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[01:17:37.443 --> 01:17:38.805]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[01:17:38.825 --> 01:17:43.029]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:44.291]  Why'd I do that?
[01:17:44.431 --> 01:17:45.973]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[01:17:46.053 --> 01:17:57.024]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality, because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better, but I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit, and that's what I promote.
[01:17:57.124 --> 01:17:58.886]  So, so, that's my advice on that.
[01:17:59.006 --> 01:17:59.507]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:17:59.907 --> 01:18:06.230]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:08.191]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[01:18:08.312 --> 01:18:09.732]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[01:18:10.072 --> 01:18:16.996]  Well, now listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[01:18:17.216 --> 01:18:21.799]  Most people have almost none of it, but if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you could have some issues.
[01:18:21.959 --> 01:18:23.119]  Detoxing, you name it.
[01:18:23.179 --> 01:18:25.821]  I mean, this is it, man.
[01:18:25.981 --> 01:18:27.402]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[01:18:27.522 --> 01:18:28.162]  It's dangerous.
[01:18:28.362 --> 01:18:31.043]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.984]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[01:18:33.004 --> 01:18:33.724]  You've got to be careful.
[01:18:33.784 --> 01:18:37.606]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[01:18:37.686 --> 01:18:39.207]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:41.928]  Your organs, everything operates.
[01:18:42.128 --> 01:18:44.269]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[01:18:44.389 --> 01:18:47.990]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:49.011]  So this is the good thing.
[01:18:49.051 --> 01:18:52.012]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the kick in the head by a mule.
[01:18:52.032 --> 01:18:53.293]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:54.193]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:56.214]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[01:18:56.374 --> 01:18:58.016]  We just researched what the globalists are doing.
[01:18:58.156 --> 01:18:58.937]  We do the opposite.
[01:18:58.977 --> 01:19:04.683]  But yes, everyone with X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[01:19:04.763 --> 01:19:05.725]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[01:19:05.845 --> 01:19:09.849]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[01:19:09.889 --> 01:19:10.650]  So let me explain it again.
[01:19:11.511 --> 01:19:12.993]  Pure iodine, you die.
[01:19:13.153 --> 01:19:14.435]  The fields are depleted.
[01:19:14.575 --> 01:19:15.356]  Everything's depleted.
[01:19:15.536 --> 01:19:21.042]  Most iodine is bound to iron, copper, or lead, or something else.
[01:19:21.102 --> 01:19:21.943]  You don't get it.
[01:19:22.043 --> 01:19:24.666]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:25.948]  So yeah, be careful.
[01:19:26.108 --> 01:19:27.409]  Iodine you have to have.
[01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:29.870]  It's just paramount.
[01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:32.331]  And so, that's why we sell it.
[01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:35.912]  That's why we've hyped it up, because it's what they don't want you to have.
[01:19:35.952 --> 01:19:40.793]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring.
[01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:45.233]  And you get in the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[01:19:45.474 --> 01:19:46.754]  Because you've never had it.
[01:19:46.974 --> 01:19:47.854]  It's just iodine.
[01:19:47.934 --> 01:19:49.674]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[01:19:49.914 --> 01:19:52.635]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:52.775 --> 01:19:57.156]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products, and it helps fund this operation a total $360.
[01:19:57.756 --> 01:19:59.257]  We win, and you know I love those.
[01:20:30.524 --> 01:20:31.024]  Welcome back.
[01:20:31.044 --> 01:20:32.224]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:32.905 --> 01:20:35.365]  We're here live weekdays 11 a.m.
[01:20:35.585 --> 01:20:36.265]  to 3 p.m.
[01:20:38.286 --> 01:20:43.107]  Right before we come on there's David Knight live weekday mornings 8 a.m.
[01:20:43.187 --> 01:20:43.887]  to 11 a.m.
[01:20:44.827 --> 01:20:46.408]  and then 3 p.m.
[01:20:46.548 --> 01:20:48.748]  Owen Schroeder and the War Room.
[01:20:50.369 --> 01:20:58.951]  So I get up here and I cover all this and I'm really extremely angry that I've been sarcastically you know talking about how sick this is
[01:20:59.983 --> 01:21:07.887]  Because, just like Joe Camel admittedly targeted children with cigarettes when I was a kid, they had candy cigarettes and candy cigars to get you ready for it.
[01:21:08.808 --> 01:21:14.351]  And it turned out that the tobacco companies early on owned those candy companies.
[01:21:16.092 --> 01:21:25.357]  And they funded the feminist movement to tell women, you show your man, get out there and smoke cigarettes, because it was seen as kind of an uncouth thing to do for ladies.
[01:21:26.766 --> 01:21:33.993]  But boy, those women, up until even the 80s and 90s, have still said, you've sure come a long way, Virginia Slim ads.
[01:21:34.734 --> 01:21:37.176]  Type in Virginia Slims, you've come a long way.
[01:21:37.216 --> 01:21:42.981]  There's even TV ads like, you're moving up in society, you're showing those men, you'll get lung cancer like them too!
[01:21:45.524 --> 01:21:46.064]  And what did they do?
[01:21:46.104 --> 01:21:51.930]  They added hundreds and hundreds of chemicals to the cigarettes to make them more addictive and to get past the blood-brain barrier.
[01:21:55.438 --> 01:21:55.978]  Now there it is.
[01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:56.999]  You've come a long way.
[01:21:59.819 --> 01:22:05.621]  Maybe in post, when we post this to InfoWars and we're not live, we should just add the add-in with audio so people can hear it.
[01:22:05.661 --> 01:22:19.286]  But it was one of Bertrand Russell's good buddies, Sigmund Freud's nephew, who came up with the idea.
[01:22:19.306 --> 01:22:20.046]  Edward Bernays.
[01:22:21.257 --> 01:22:26.343]  To fund full-page ads telling women, march for suffrage and have freedom torches.
[01:22:26.843 --> 01:22:28.205]  Hold up your cigarettes.
[01:22:29.706 --> 01:22:34.772]  They had doctors on TV later saying, smoke camels, they'll...
[01:22:48.394 --> 01:22:49.755]  Oh, Mickey Mouse!
[01:22:50.236 --> 01:22:52.237]  You'll be with Mickey in your grave.
[01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:53.659]  Your brain cells.
[01:22:53.999 --> 01:22:55.981]  And it all tastes like candy.
[01:22:56.261 --> 01:22:57.442]  And you tell the kids don't eat it.
[01:22:58.042 --> 01:22:59.063]  But they do.
[01:23:00.024 --> 01:23:03.127]  They eat the candy, and then they see the pretty colors.
[01:23:03.667 --> 01:23:05.048]  And then they don't do too well.
[01:23:05.489 --> 01:23:06.409]  But that's alright.
[01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.572]  It's all for the greater good of the New World Order.
[01:23:10.633 --> 01:23:13.716]  It's all done so there's not pesky people with high IQs in the way.
[01:23:15.234 --> 01:23:18.918]  Who will actually read the textbooks they wrote like we're idiots and don't even care?
[01:23:18.938 --> 01:23:23.963]  And then we've got fluoride for babies.
[01:23:26.406 --> 01:23:28.948]  Fluoride for babies.
[01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:31.551]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:23:33.653 --> 01:23:37.417]  Well, I'm going to show you the studies saying, oh, don't, don't.
[01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:42.850]  Give your kids any fluoride before their teeth erupt, because the studies are conclusive.
[01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:47.851]  They go in and cause the teeth to be malformed, have dental fluorosis, and fracture and be chalky.
[01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:51.852]  That was the American Dental Association 20 years ago.
[01:23:52.372 --> 01:23:54.572]  Started hedging its bets and creeping away from fluoride.
[01:23:57.413 --> 01:23:58.373]  Let me show you those studies.
[01:23:59.053 --> 01:24:06.175]  But again, here's the Pentagon, BBC, you name it, saying, chemicals to make males not have children.
[01:24:07.415 --> 01:24:07.795]  Gay bomb.
[01:24:09.815 --> 01:24:10.436]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:24:12.037 --> 01:24:13.198]  Forbes says I'm crazy.
[01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:19.343]  There's no studies, they say, that fluoride lowers IQ.
[01:24:19.383 --> 01:24:20.483]  They just say I made it up.
[01:24:23.306 --> 01:24:23.826]  Well, here it is.
[01:24:23.886 --> 01:24:26.889]  Study prompts call for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women.
[01:24:27.369 --> 01:24:30.491]  Reuters, because it lowers the IQs, particularly in boys.
[01:24:31.372 --> 01:24:31.912]  Massively.
[01:24:34.254 --> 01:24:36.016]  Over the years, up to 20, 30, 40 points.
[01:24:36.096 --> 01:24:37.057]  Double bad for blacks.
[01:24:37.955 --> 01:24:40.337]  Study links fluorinated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:44.199]  Let me show you the other ones I was going to tell you about.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.282]  Fluoride, developmental neurotoxicity, another study.
[01:24:48.782 --> 01:24:48.862]  U.S.
[01:24:48.882 --> 01:24:50.403]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:24:51.264 --> 01:24:52.805]  National toxicity program.
[01:24:53.085 --> 01:24:58.228]  So they mandate to put it in and tell you, by the way, we're killing you while we do it.
[01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:04.192]  Drinking fluorinated water during pregnancy may lower IQs in sons.
[01:25:05.543 --> 01:25:11.004]  Again, runoff of atrazine causing frogs to rape and toads to rape pythons.
[01:25:13.505 --> 01:25:14.225]  Rape snakes.
[01:25:14.945 --> 01:25:15.566]  Gang rape them.
[01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:21.327]  Oh, the fluoride's not making the chemicals in the water, making the frogs gay.
[01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:25.428]  They're just making them sterile and rapist.
[01:25:28.509 --> 01:25:31.850]  Prenatal fluoride exposure and cognitive outcomes in children.
[01:25:33.157 --> 01:25:34.879]  Mexico study shows the exact same thing.
[01:25:34.959 --> 01:25:36.341]  Massive IQ reduction.
[01:25:37.863 --> 01:25:48.237]  Infant formula says don't mix in formulas that use water that have fluoride because it'll increase the chances of fluorosis.
[01:25:49.779 --> 01:25:50.761]  But that's just the warning.
[01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:56.911]  You're never told that when you're at the end cap of the grocery store and all there is is fluoride for your baby.
[01:25:57.551 --> 01:26:00.052]  So they got screwed up teeth and screwed up brains.
[01:26:00.552 --> 01:26:00.972]  Yay!
[01:26:01.092 --> 01:26:02.252]  Thanks, New World Order!
[01:26:02.732 --> 01:26:09.294]  Well, if we can't abort them, or get their organs after they're born, we're gonna teach your son he's really a girl and chop his balls off.
[01:26:10.394 --> 01:26:10.514]  Oh!
[01:26:13.175 --> 01:26:17.576]  And now, the Drag Queen Story Times don't just have children humping men's groins.
[01:26:18.593 --> 01:26:27.915]  Now they have books at the library teaching six-year-olds oral sex and how enjoyable it is and how, if you see a man at the park, go pull your pants down, he'll do something for you.
[01:26:28.976 --> 01:26:30.956]  Oh yeah, they're telling him, go to him, get in the white van.
[01:26:31.116 --> 01:26:32.416]  Actually, go to the man.
[01:26:33.277 --> 01:26:36.718]  The man comes in your backyard, climb out.
[01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:37.958]  This is in libraries.
[01:26:38.538 --> 01:26:39.318]  Four children.
[01:26:40.138 --> 01:26:41.719]  Hey kids, go to the park.
[01:26:42.339 --> 01:26:43.439]  Go to the pervert park.
[01:26:43.839 --> 01:26:44.739]  Go in the bathroom.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:46.420]  He's got a prize for you.
[01:26:48.046 --> 01:26:48.967]  Hey, Georgie.
[01:26:49.987 --> 01:26:51.968]  Stick your arm down in here.
[01:26:53.469 --> 01:26:54.230]  So, there you go.
[01:26:55.491 --> 01:26:59.253]  See, I just documented all that, but Forbes... What did Forbes say?
[01:26:59.713 --> 01:27:01.834]  They said the word ridiculous.
[01:27:02.855 --> 01:27:06.718]  They said Alex Jones is... ridiculous.
[01:27:07.738 --> 01:27:09.299]  There's no IQ reduction.
[01:27:09.779 --> 01:27:10.680]  Particularly in boys.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.061]  Exactly as I said.
[01:27:13.302 --> 01:27:13.762]  Forbes.
[01:27:15.879 --> 01:27:16.960]  What a good person.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:22.542]  And you know, so many of these leftists I learned at the city councils and state level, it's always leftists pushing this.
[01:27:22.702 --> 01:27:23.783]  We've been to these meetings now.
[01:27:25.123 --> 01:27:28.725]  They admit they're lowering IQ and they're a ruling class.
[01:27:28.745 --> 01:27:29.806]  I used to think they were just dumb.
[01:27:29.826 --> 01:27:33.647]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, none of them drink it.
[01:27:33.947 --> 01:27:34.728]  Their kids don't get it.
[01:27:35.268 --> 01:27:36.409]  They want to get ahead.
[01:27:36.489 --> 01:27:41.191]  They're so satanic that they love being in on the club where they walk to the mall.
[01:27:42.652 --> 01:27:44.433]  And 50 years ago, there wouldn't be one kid with cancer.
[01:27:44.453 --> 01:27:46.294]  Now, like, God, look at half the kids out there dying.
[01:27:46.834 --> 01:27:48.995]  Wow, pediatric cancer is up 50,000 percent or whatever.
[01:27:49.235 --> 01:27:50.496]  Diabetes up 3,000 percent.
[01:27:50.516 --> 01:27:50.896]  Type 2.
[01:27:51.736 --> 01:27:54.358]  Wow, man, we're really... These people don't know how we killed them.
[01:27:56.118 --> 01:28:00.821]  And they all filter their water and eat organic and just... And it's their pleasure.
[01:28:02.141 --> 01:28:03.382]  They all go to the Whole Foods.
[01:28:03.422 --> 01:28:08.624]  They all... They all try to stay away from what they're doing to us because it's their ruling class.
[01:28:11.866 --> 01:28:12.126]  And it's...
[01:28:13.433 --> 01:28:22.473]  Just like in ancient Japan, even ancient Europe, you couldn't have a hunting dog, if you had it for herding sheep, they'd cut half its paws off, half its digits off.
[01:28:23.351 --> 01:28:25.352]  So that it could never hunt the king's deer or whatever.
[01:28:25.372 --> 01:28:29.835]  And they'd also make sure the lower levels didn't get enough food to ever be straight and strong.
[01:28:30.015 --> 01:28:33.017]  That's a thing of feudalism to, like bonsai trees, keep them little.
[01:28:33.277 --> 01:28:34.218]  The nobles will be big.
[01:28:34.458 --> 01:28:35.358]  Ha ha ha!
[01:28:35.939 --> 01:28:37.119]  Little people serve me!
[01:28:37.139 --> 01:28:39.281]  I told a free number to join us to talk about this.
[01:28:39.301 --> 01:28:41.742]  I guess we're all going to keep drinking and giving to our kids, right?
[01:28:42.082 --> 01:28:43.203]  Watch the eyes dim.
[01:28:43.683 --> 01:28:45.464]  Celebrate our Luciferian pleasure.
[01:28:46.305 --> 01:28:46.585]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:46.605 --> 01:28:46.866]  877-789-Alex.
[01:28:46.886 --> 01:28:46.926]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:47.046 --> 01:28:48.807]  What do you think about this?
[01:28:48.828 --> 01:28:50.469]  What are we gonna do about this?
[01:28:50.489 --> 01:28:50.709]  Nothing!
[01:28:50.729 --> 01:28:52.651]  Can't you tell your children?
[01:28:52.691 --> 01:28:53.512]  Tell them for Lucifer!
[01:29:07.284 --> 01:29:10.067]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:29:10.347 --> 01:29:13.490]  The British ended up being the most powerful empire in the world.
[01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:15.031]  Not because the Spanish couldn't fight.
[01:29:15.111 --> 01:29:16.653]  Not because the Portuguese couldn't fight.
[01:29:16.753 --> 01:29:19.275]  Not because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire couldn't fight.
[01:29:19.335 --> 01:29:21.537]  You ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[01:29:21.877 --> 01:29:24.219]  The British ended up getting basically key limes.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:35.302]  When they went into the Caribbean 500 years ago, and they had their captains right, and their ship's doctors, how long sailors survived, what climates, they were trying to figure out what's making sickness.
[01:29:35.322 --> 01:29:38.443]  They weren't sure if it was hot air or why they got close to the shore.
[01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:40.303]  More of their sailors would die in a couple days.
[01:29:40.423 --> 01:29:42.163]  And they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes.
[01:29:42.303 --> 01:29:44.784]  But the British classified that 400 years ago.
[01:29:44.844 --> 01:29:46.644]  So the British would always lay off the coast.
[01:29:46.864 --> 01:29:49.205]  And foreigners would ask, why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[01:29:49.225 --> 01:29:50.325]  Because they don't want mosquitoes.
[01:29:50.525 --> 01:29:51.245]  And they didn't get all the
[01:29:52.446 --> 01:29:56.731]  Well, the Brits also figured out with their scientists, limes.
[01:29:56.951 --> 01:29:58.593]  But the Brits were suspicious.
[01:29:58.633 --> 01:30:00.495]  The average sailor thought if you swim, you get sick.
[01:30:00.535 --> 01:30:03.037]  And they thought, you know, you don't want to eat vegetables, they make you sick.
[01:30:03.057 --> 01:30:04.839]  This is what people actually thought back then.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:08.764]  So they would put the limes in the grog.
[01:30:09.324 --> 01:30:10.065]  Which is what's grog?
[01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:11.566]  One-third rum, two-thirds water.
[01:30:11.786 --> 01:30:13.147]  To make sure they would at least drink their water.
[01:30:13.187 --> 01:30:16.530]  Part of their pay, their daily ration for good behavior, was grog.
[01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:21.634]  So on the job, all sailors, Spanish, Russian, it didn't matter, they were paid in alcohol.
[01:30:21.654 --> 01:30:23.496]  And part of their daily food was alcohol.
[01:30:23.536 --> 01:30:28.700]  So the British would start putting, 400 years ago, limes in the alcohol, the grog.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.645]  And so, what would happen when they were a thousand miles from home and ran up against a Spanish frigate twice their size?
[01:30:34.825 --> 01:30:36.867]  Well, the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out.
[01:30:36.947 --> 01:30:38.208]  They had cuts all over them.
[01:30:38.388 --> 01:30:40.169]  Open wounds.
[01:30:40.349 --> 01:30:41.430]  No fresh vegetables.
[01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:55.158]  No vitamin C. Well, notice the British for 200 years could keep it secret that limes were... And so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in.
[01:30:55.438 --> 01:31:01.482]  And they would put it in the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight.
[01:31:02.102 --> 01:31:05.245]  Because they've got vitamin C. So I'm going into a plug here, but here's the deal.
[01:31:05.445 --> 01:31:10.730]  Every study, Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes for vitamin C. So these are the things that are known.
[01:31:10.871 --> 01:31:14.554]  If you think vitamin C is powerful, the stuff at DNA Force is even beyond that.
[01:31:14.674 --> 01:31:15.735]  It's the next level of that.
[01:31:15.916 --> 01:31:16.676]  That's what we know.
[01:31:16.696 --> 01:31:20.420]  And when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine,
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.360]  It uses the bad halogen.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:24.882]  And at a certain point, the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive.
[01:31:25.102 --> 01:31:28.203]  They start mutating so they can use that and not die.
[01:31:28.503 --> 01:31:31.224]  But then they take over your body and you die from cancer.
[01:31:31.344 --> 01:31:38.727]  And so, so much of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[01:31:38.907 --> 01:31:41.087]  And they work around the clock with all these fake reports.
[01:31:41.187 --> 01:31:45.209]  Oh, you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals, you don't need... And they lower the amount you're supposed to take.
[01:31:45.289 --> 01:31:48.230]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:32:04.235 --> 01:32:07.957]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[01:32:08.197 --> 01:32:14.800]  That's why we created the 8-Pack Power Stack, your go-to option for the building blocks of a successful approach to supplementation.

[01:33:06.903 --> 01:33:09.627]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.114 --> 01:33:19.820]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.281 --> 01:33:23.125]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:36.354 --> 01:33:39.815]  Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.
[01:33:40.835 --> 01:33:50.957]  So, I'm here looking at the actual government documents, official policy, fluoride to lower your IQ, fluoride to lower your fertility.
[01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:51.718]  They've done it.
[01:33:51.738 --> 01:33:54.778]  I mean, type in US IQs plummeting.
[01:33:55.218 --> 01:33:56.159]  That's genetic.
[01:33:56.519 --> 01:33:57.119]  That's chemical.
[01:33:57.579 --> 01:33:58.219]  That's physical.
[01:33:59.119 --> 01:34:02.700]  And I just showed you all these big new studies that came out from JAMA, you name it.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.761]  I mean, okay, it's giving you cancer, it's lowering your IQ, especially men.
[01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:10.920]  And their answer is to come out and attack me.
[01:34:12.741 --> 01:34:13.802]  Because I think it's sick.
[01:34:13.922 --> 01:34:14.482]  I think it's evil.
[01:34:14.502 --> 01:34:15.062]  I think it's horrible.
[01:34:15.362 --> 01:34:17.243]  You know all about the Tuskegee experiments.
[01:34:17.283 --> 01:34:19.724]  You know all about the secret testing.
[01:34:19.744 --> 01:34:21.545]  You know all about the stuff that's gone on and happened.
[01:34:23.286 --> 01:34:25.707]  And it's a criminal group inside Western governments.
[01:34:25.967 --> 01:34:32.270]  It's a scientific dictatorship that is carrying all of this out.
[01:34:34.191 --> 01:34:35.332]  And they know what they're doing.
[01:34:36.532 --> 01:34:37.493]  And it's premeditated.
[01:34:38.703 --> 01:34:40.443]  So what do we do about that?
[01:34:41.144 --> 01:34:44.644]  Because 70-something percent of the country's fluoridated.
[01:34:44.664 --> 01:34:46.765]  They're fluoridating about half of Europe now.
[01:34:47.745 --> 01:35:04.709]  And I've gone with Harvard and Princeton top toxicologists, and I've shown them universal letters signed by the unions of these federal agencies, universal, saying, we want this out.
[01:35:05.489 --> 01:35:07.810]  So see, 99% of the government's not bad people.
[01:35:08.561 --> 01:35:09.461]  But it stays in.
[01:35:10.021 --> 01:35:13.322]  I showed you last segment studies from the U.S.
[01:35:13.422 --> 01:35:13.923]  government.
[01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:14.783]  Warnings!
[01:35:17.584 --> 01:35:23.786]  I mean, this isn't like Prop 65 where there's one part, again, per billion of lead in the air, but they say it can't be in food.
[01:35:23.966 --> 01:35:24.646]  That's impossible.
[01:35:25.026 --> 01:35:25.926]  It has no effects on you.
[01:35:27.047 --> 01:35:29.127]  It's non-detectable in almost all systems.
[01:35:30.208 --> 01:35:35.229]  We're talking about ten parts per hundred in some of these toothpastes?
[01:35:35.269 --> 01:35:38.170]  I mean, that's a psychological and mental death sentence.
[01:35:40.316 --> 01:35:44.958]  What it is, is a chemical weapon to induce a biological effect.
[01:35:46.279 --> 01:35:47.539]  It is a chemical lobotomy.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:55.403]  And you warn people about this, and they just go, oh, I heard that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:35:58.865 --> 01:36:05.408]  Because we all saw Dr. Strangelove and Stanley Kubrick, who was putting that in there to warn people about it.
[01:36:05.448 --> 01:36:08.349]  But the only way to get it past the system was to make it a joke.
[01:36:10.267 --> 01:36:14.170]  To tie it to end of the world nuclear weapons and fluoride.
[01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:23.556]  See, you can die from nuclear weapons, you can die from fluoride, you can die from the big quick weapon, or you can die from the slow weapon, the silent weapon, for quiet wars.
[01:36:24.277 --> 01:36:25.378]  That's another Pentagon paper.
[01:36:25.398 --> 01:36:32.883]  So I'm gonna go to your phone calls, but it was Connor, who's a big exercise aficionado, swimmer,
[01:36:34.278 --> 01:36:38.719]  And he said, yeah, you're talking about women having twice as strong, on average, blood-brain barriers as men.
[01:36:38.739 --> 01:36:41.059]  And that's why they don't get as much autism.
[01:36:41.099 --> 01:36:44.040]  It's why they don't get their IQ lowered as much.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.060]  Fluoride mainly targets men.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.101]  It hurts women really bad.
[01:36:48.121 --> 01:36:52.161]  I mean, it's just like shooting three bullets into you instead of six.
[01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:53.441]  It still doesn't feel too good.
[01:36:55.382 --> 01:36:58.702]  But males are geared for quick action, strength.
[01:37:00.123 --> 01:37:01.663]  Not really defensive.
[01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:08.839]  That's why, again, female babies are twice as strong at being able to take insults.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.122]  That's what the medical system calls being cut, being shot, being poisoned.
[01:37:12.543 --> 01:37:15.905]  Insults to the nervous system that men can take.
[01:37:16.726 --> 01:37:19.268]  Men are, on average, twice as strong muscularly.
[01:37:20.009 --> 01:37:21.190]  Men, on average, have better vision.
[01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:22.011]  We're all different.
[01:37:22.031 --> 01:37:23.032]  Like, they have a womb.
[01:37:23.512 --> 01:37:25.474]  They are designed to protect that.
[01:37:27.335 --> 01:37:29.776]  And try to build little nesties and things.
[01:37:29.836 --> 01:37:30.736]  That's how we're designed.
[01:37:30.776 --> 01:37:33.177]  And the men go out and defend the nest and bring things back into the nest.
[01:37:33.197 --> 01:37:34.337]  Well, they've already broken that up.
[01:37:35.578 --> 01:37:45.401]  So the human system is being destroyed before your eyes, and then they introduce, right out of Russian gulags and Nazi death camps, fluoridated water.
[01:37:47.462 --> 01:37:48.562]  And that's a historical fact.
[01:37:49.823 --> 01:37:53.164]  And the only reason I'm hammering it now is people always ask me, hey, you don't cover fluoride as much.
[01:37:53.964 --> 01:37:55.465]  And I say, man, I've made documentaries.
[01:37:55.505 --> 01:37:56.065]  I've probably done
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.162]  Thousand shows on it, I had all these scientists, and I would have scientists.
[01:38:04.224 --> 01:38:13.069]  I'd get those guys back on, brain surges, you name it, and I'd bring them down to City Council, and the mayors would laugh at them.
[01:38:13.089 --> 01:38:15.671]  They'd say, here's all the studies, here's the facts, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:16.011 --> 01:38:19.453]  They'd go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho.
[01:38:20.073 --> 01:38:22.615]  These studies were already out there, but people are listening now.
[01:38:24.224 --> 01:38:25.485]  Because they know about the Epstein.
[01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:27.185]  And they know about the globalists.
[01:38:27.225 --> 01:38:28.206]  They know about the world government.
[01:38:28.226 --> 01:38:30.567]  They know about radical Islam being funded and protected.
[01:38:30.627 --> 01:38:32.348]  And they don't trust the system anymore.
[01:38:32.368 --> 01:38:35.049]  And they don't trust mainstream media.
[01:38:35.069 --> 01:38:36.350]  The system has cratered.
[01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:39.031]  That's why they're trying to start a race war to start it all over again.
[01:38:40.231 --> 01:38:43.313]  With a civil war so bad that all of this gets forgotten.
[01:38:46.675 --> 01:38:53.698]  You know, we were given a tour of the water treatment plant that I'm going to recall is here in Austin.
[01:38:54.822 --> 01:38:57.223]  And they said, don't shoot video, wink wink, but let us.
[01:38:58.004 --> 01:38:59.665]  And there's skull and crossbones all over the fluoride.
[01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:01.646]  They said if one drop gets on you, it eats through your skin.
[01:39:02.006 --> 01:39:04.787]  They show where a drop got on the concrete and ate three inches of the concrete.
[01:39:05.808 --> 01:39:12.652]  The only acid, there's a few acids out there that act like the fictitious, fictional alien blood in the movie Alien and Aliens.
[01:39:13.992 --> 01:39:20.236]  Pure fluoride, hydrofluorosilicic, literally eats through concrete like a hot knife through butter.
[01:39:21.178 --> 01:39:23.080]  Now what do you think that does inside your body?
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:29.826]  It grabs all the other toxins, they all link up with it and just delivers hell through your tissues.
[01:39:31.948 --> 01:39:33.690]  In fact, it's one of the biggest causes of cancer.
[01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:35.792]  But where are the lawyers suing over fluoride?
[01:39:36.412 --> 01:39:37.293]  They know not to do it.
[01:39:39.435 --> 01:39:43.779]  Even though it's open and shut because it's just like the chem trailing.
[01:39:49.491 --> 01:39:53.894]  It's just like the chemtrailing.
[01:39:57.397 --> 01:40:11.687]  CFR, former CIA director, comes out, says, yeah, we're adding barium sulfate dioxide to jet fuel for the major suppliers, and then it creates nuclei in the atmosphere, and we control the weather.
[01:40:12.607 --> 01:40:13.308]  We block out the sun.
[01:40:13.628 --> 01:40:18.251]  And then Bill Gates comes out in Smithsonian Magazine a week ago and says, yeah, we're doing it.
[01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:18.952]  We're spraying you.
[01:40:20.316 --> 01:40:22.917]  And it's like, Jones, you are really discredited now.
[01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:25.798]  Jones, you are the filth of the planet.
[01:40:26.378 --> 01:40:27.738]  Exactly as I said with Epstein.
[01:40:28.098 --> 01:40:32.880]  I said he's into eugenics, he's into death cults, he's into Satanism, and he's into cloning.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.360]  That hasn't come out yet.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.481]  You watch, the cloning's gonna come out.
[01:40:39.202 --> 01:40:42.843]  What do you think he was given all these mysterious millions for?
[01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:59.148]  He was an investment of the Albert Einstein Institute that he headed up to carry out the development of a planetary regime to carry out the extermination of the human population and the rise of the Superman, in German, Ubermensch.
[01:41:04.349 --> 01:41:05.529]  You can go watch my film, Endgame.
[01:41:05.609 --> 01:41:08.550]  I show you that institute, I show you who's at it.
[01:41:09.250 --> 01:41:10.650]  Could have gone and seen the head, Epstein.
[01:41:13.496 --> 01:41:16.438]  They're abusing the children for trauma-based mind control.
[01:41:17.398 --> 01:41:23.782]  Again, the 15- and 14-year-old girls, they're just the outer room.
[01:41:23.822 --> 01:41:25.303]  We're going to go to break.
[01:41:25.323 --> 01:41:26.304]  I'll be right back with your calls.
[01:41:26.344 --> 01:41:31.027]  But it was Connor saying, hey, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:31.147 --> 01:41:37.531]  And the way to boost your blood-brain barrier and your very brain tissue itself to be more resistant to all of this is DHE.
[01:41:38.311 --> 01:41:41.954]  And what has the strongest, purest DHE out there?
[01:41:42.134 --> 01:41:42.434]  Krillin.
[01:41:45.222 --> 01:41:49.743]  Krill Oil, ladies and gentlemen, and we sell the very best Krill Oil.
[01:41:51.343 --> 01:41:59.645]  You can find 100% reviews at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslive.com.
[01:42:00.566 --> 01:42:02.766]  Takes you right to it, and it's been sold out for three months.
[01:42:02.786 --> 01:42:05.367]  We just got it back in, but it's still discounted 50%.
[01:42:07.822 --> 01:42:10.284]  And we've got to end that special soon because it's going to sell out.
[01:42:10.505 --> 01:42:13.828]  I told Chris, a double order that next time.
[01:42:13.848 --> 01:42:16.270]  People now get how important krill oil is.
[01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:17.351]  We also have honor roll.
[01:42:18.752 --> 01:42:19.493]  That's for children.
[01:42:19.513 --> 01:42:26.119]  That's a mixture of different key oils for the brain and the heart and all the barriers, the cell walls, the
[01:42:28.046 --> 01:42:32.149]  The ventricles in the heart, but you know, it's also an anti-inflammatory.
[01:42:32.569 --> 01:42:33.030]  DHE.
[01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:40.035]  And so for me, the reason I like it, is I like to have really cool, full color, awesome dreams.
[01:42:40.715 --> 01:42:43.497]  And uh, well, dreams a little bit more now, we all know that.
[01:42:43.517 --> 01:42:45.219]  So I like to go places in my sleep.
[01:42:45.259 --> 01:42:48.321]  So, I gobbled, and I'm not saying you should do this, I gobbled,
[01:42:54.631 --> 01:43:04.637]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:06.678]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[01:43:07.018 --> 01:43:08.379]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:43:08.779 --> 01:43:09.699]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:14.942]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:43:15.863 --> 01:43:17.544]  So, you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:18.324]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:43:19.024 --> 01:43:19.765]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:43:20.788 --> 01:43:22.028]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:43:22.268 --> 01:43:24.669]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:25.729]  I don't want them to win.
[01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:28.110]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:31.790]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:43:32.150 --> 01:43:34.911]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists enough of their money.
[01:43:35.291 --> 01:43:39.052]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:43:39.092 --> 01:43:40.332]  These will change your life.
[01:43:40.672 --> 01:43:42.052]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:43:42.072 --> 01:43:43.793]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:43:44.073 --> 01:43:44.733]  Check it all out.
[01:43:44.753 --> 01:43:46.373]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:43:46.713 --> 01:43:48.314]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[01:43:48.514 --> 01:43:49.694]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:55.720]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[01:44:15.999 --> 01:44:17.879]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:27.082]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.

[01:44:42.625 --> 01:44:50.796]  They're only printing a limited supply of these t-shirts, so make sure you get yours right now at InfoWarsStore.com before they sell out.
[01:44:51.336 --> 01:44:53.960]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[01:44:56.924 --> 01:44:58.325]  Flawless victory.
[01:45:05.683 --> 01:45:08.344]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:45:08.704 --> 01:45:14.607]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[01:46:02.975 --> 01:46:14.003]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:46:14.063 --> 01:46:22.669]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[01:46:22.929 --> 01:46:26.952]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:46:27.612 --> 01:46:33.955]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[01:46:34.075 --> 01:46:36.155]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[01:46:36.255 --> 01:46:42.138]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[01:46:42.178 --> 01:46:44.739]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[01:46:45.439 --> 01:46:55.326]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[01:46:55.827 --> 01:47:02.231]  So go to InfowarsStore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[01:47:06.254 --> 01:47:08.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.534 --> 01:47:30.875]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:30.895 --> 01:47:31.856]  I'm going to your calls now.
[01:47:32.897 --> 01:47:39.743]  And then coming up at the bottom of the next hour, Joey Gibson is going to pop in, but I'm going to Tim and Ryan and Alex and everybody else here in about a minute.
[01:47:40.344 --> 01:47:41.785]  I want to just go back to plugging here.
[01:47:43.663 --> 01:47:51.008]  Because I didn't plug anything to the very end of the first hour, and I was here doing accounting yesterday, and I don't want to sit here and complain.
[01:47:51.028 --> 01:47:56.651]  I don't think this is really the time to get into this, but there's two different paths we can go down, because I'm never giving up.
[01:47:57.472 --> 01:48:02.095]  I can massively downsize in about a year, so everybody's still got their job.
[01:48:06.978 --> 01:48:07.038]  Or?
[01:48:08.447 --> 01:48:10.108]  I can figure out how to get more money into here.
[01:48:10.128 --> 01:48:11.388]  I mean, it's really simple.
[01:48:12.448 --> 01:48:13.229]  See, here's the deal.
[01:48:13.249 --> 01:48:14.629]  We got great customers that buy the products.
[01:48:15.869 --> 01:48:28.273]  And so if I sell all the inventory we have, some of it's out to six months, of t-shirts, books, films, supplements, because we're self-funding, I can pay all the bills for a year.
[01:48:29.914 --> 01:48:33.215]  But I've now hit a point in the mathematics
[01:48:34.534 --> 01:48:38.236]  Because folks like raises and bonuses, and I want to expand, and I want to fight hard.
[01:48:40.076 --> 01:48:49.761]  So I'm in a race, and I've got so much gas before my next pit stop to refuel, and I want to push it one more lap to win the race, but I might run out of gas before I finish the race.
[01:48:49.801 --> 01:48:53.562]  But if I pull over into the pit stop, I don't think we'll make it.
[01:48:53.642 --> 01:48:56.684]  I mean, so I've really been praying about this, and I mean praying hard.
[01:48:57.865 --> 01:49:06.710]  And really, I just told myself, you've got to cut better ads, you've got to explain how good these products are, and you've just really got to get up off your ass and explain to the listeners that this is serious.
[01:49:07.450 --> 01:49:08.371]  Because it's always serious.
[01:49:08.411 --> 01:49:09.351]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:49:09.371 --> 01:49:12.173]  They've taken our sponsors, harassed us, sued us over the years.
[01:49:12.193 --> 01:49:13.033]  I mean, you know what's going on.
[01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.814]  They tried to plant child porn on us.
[01:49:15.314 --> 01:49:15.975]  It's been incredible.
[01:49:17.656 --> 01:49:22.819]  And we've cut the fat down to the bone.
[01:49:22.859 --> 01:49:23.899]  We've figured out a lot of things.
[01:49:23.939 --> 01:49:26.981]  I've gotten better at business and a lot of things.
[01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:29.243]  To be able to still be on air.
[01:49:29.624 --> 01:49:31.724]  And you've come through spreading the word and your financial support.
[01:49:31.784 --> 01:49:37.026]  But I want to add some more shows which are happening next month.
[01:49:37.066 --> 01:49:38.226]  And I want to fight back.
[01:49:38.286 --> 01:49:40.527]  And I want to be able to defeat these lawsuits, which I can do.
[01:49:41.727 --> 01:49:42.368]  We beat a lot of them.
[01:49:42.388 --> 01:49:43.248]  You'll never hear that in the news.
[01:49:45.068 --> 01:49:46.149]  But I really need people to understand.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:58.555]  Hey, if I just go sign up for auto-ship so I don't forget, and I get my coffee, and I get my fluoride-free toothpaste, fortified with ionic little silver, and if I get my fish oil and my krill oil, things everybody should be taking.
[01:50:00.418 --> 01:50:01.259]  And my water filtration.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:07.183]  And if you've had a filter two, three years, Alexa Pure Appropriate, probably time to replace those filters.
[01:50:07.903 --> 01:50:09.525]  They're already rated the highest quality out there.
[01:50:09.545 --> 01:50:15.309]  And you're like, yeah, they're half the price of stuff at a fancy store because they mark stuff up three, four times.
[01:50:15.789 --> 01:50:17.150]  And you know, that's how they stay in business.
[01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:17.850]  We don't do that.
[01:50:19.272 --> 01:50:21.333]  I make 70 bucks on a filter at full price.
[01:50:21.353 --> 01:50:22.154]  You know, the big ones.
[01:50:22.534 --> 01:50:23.234]  When that's on sale, $35.
[01:50:26.107 --> 01:50:29.511]  And so we bring in a ton of money, but we've got smart listeners.
[01:50:29.551 --> 01:50:36.799]  We've got Midwest and Texans and folks out West and farmers and people in the, you know, blue collar folks, you know, and the East Coast everywhere.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:46.370]  And, and, and, you know, a lot of business people and they're all shrewd and you come by stuff from us because we've got good deals, but take the ultimate krill oil.
[01:50:48.865 --> 01:50:52.548]  The ultimate krill oil, ladies and gentlemen, is the ultimate krill oil.
[01:50:52.568 --> 01:50:55.830]  We went out and found the highest rated organic one that does the process.
[01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:58.812]  If there's any mercury to remove it, that's what triples the cost for us.
[01:50:59.293 --> 01:51:07.559]  It's already super low in krill, but we know we're getting tested in California by their standards that are impossible to pass, so we go to the insane level.
[01:51:08.019 --> 01:51:12.603]  And you notice this is just that beautiful red of krill, and you couldn't do something better for your body and your life.
[01:51:13.692 --> 01:51:15.253]  And then separately, we've got the T-shirts.
[01:51:15.273 --> 01:51:21.659]  We're almost sold out of the Chris Pratt-inspired shirts, where it says, Don't Tread on Me, with the Betsy Ross flag that triggers the Libtards.
[01:51:22.059 --> 01:51:22.540]  So bad.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.844]  We've got the limited edition Space Force shirt that we're about to redesign.
[01:51:27.904 --> 01:51:28.965]  It'll be a new limited edition.
[01:51:29.385 --> 01:51:34.650]  But if you want to help fund the operation and get great threads, both those shirts have that real soft, nice fabric.
[01:51:36.732 --> 01:51:38.573]  I mean, I know the Space Shuttle shirt cost us like $12 a piece.
[01:51:41.124 --> 01:51:43.225]  So when we're selling it for $9.95, that is a really good deal.
[01:51:43.245 --> 01:51:44.705]  I mean, it's just really nice fabric.
[01:51:45.246 --> 01:51:46.766]  It's a high-quality designer t-shirt.
[01:51:47.066 --> 01:51:48.787]  Ball caps, it's all there in Fullershore.com.
[01:51:49.007 --> 01:51:49.968]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:51:50.088 --> 01:51:50.788]  I'm done plugging.
[01:51:51.968 --> 01:51:56.650]  It's just, these are products you already need, and it funds the operation.
[01:51:56.690 --> 01:52:08.375]  So things you're gonna reorder, like protein bars, or like TurboForce, or things like BrainForce, or things like the toothpaste, or things like the coffee, just sign up for AutoShip.
[01:52:10.179 --> 01:52:13.981]  You sign up for every month, every two months, every three months, and just one click, it's free, you cancel.
[01:52:14.361 --> 01:52:18.963]  But it just keeps coming so you don't forget, and then we know that that's there each month to support what we're doing.
[01:52:19.603 --> 01:52:20.203]  Very simple.
[01:52:20.664 --> 01:52:25.226]  Shop with us, we save the Second Amendment, pull the fluoride out of the water, it's happening all across the country.
[01:52:25.246 --> 01:52:29.248]  I think we're down to like 60% now, instead of 75 a few years ago.
[01:52:29.548 --> 01:52:30.748]  I mean, we're winning, folks.
[01:52:31.268 --> 01:52:35.330]  But, we're winning the info war, but this operation is shot full of holes.
[01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:38.812]  And so, the dry dock is you buying stuff.
[01:52:39.881 --> 01:52:42.205]  And we need that support, so thank you.
[01:52:43.467 --> 01:52:45.930]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls or go to your calls.
[01:52:47.152 --> 01:52:48.614]  Tim, thanks for holding in Montana.
[01:52:48.634 --> 01:52:49.676]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:52.340]  Talk about water and the chemicals that are in it.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:52.661]  Go ahead.
[01:52:54.164 --> 01:52:54.564]  Hi, Alex.
[01:52:54.684 --> 01:52:58.845]  Actually, I was going to talk about hydrofluoric acid use in oil refineries.
[01:52:58.865 --> 01:53:04.387]  You know, they use HF acid in oil refineries very extensively.
[01:53:04.807 --> 01:53:12.549]  And in those areas, they're painted off, marked very, very significantly to where people obviously know where those areas they're at.
[01:53:12.909 --> 01:53:16.370]  You have to wear special, you know, like rain suits.
[01:53:16.410 --> 01:53:18.291]  You have to have all your cuffs taped off and everything.
[01:53:18.311 --> 01:53:21.452]  They have tools that they only use in those areas.
[01:53:21.832 --> 01:53:22.672]  Because if you get
[01:53:23.473 --> 01:53:36.558]  Even a small portion of that into your skin, the acid is drawn to the calcium in your bones, and it will actually dissolve your bones, and a very small amount of that will kill you.
[01:53:37.218 --> 01:53:48.303]  And the pH level on a hydrofluoric acid is 3.17, whereas hydrofluorosilicic acid is 1.2, so hydrofluorosilicic acid is even more acidic
[01:53:48.903 --> 01:53:59.490]  Then what they're using in these oil refineries that they take great precautions to prevent their employees from from coming in contact with that and yet we're dumping the stuff that's more acidic in our water.
[01:53:59.730 --> 01:54:13.699]  By the way you're an incredible caller stay there but it sounds like you're either an engineer or a scientist or a someone or a roughneck that's really informed because you're absolutely right about that and again all I gotta do is type in
[01:54:14.673 --> 01:54:14.933]  Exactly.
[01:54:14.953 --> 01:54:16.795]  The oil and gas refining process
[01:54:31.054 --> 01:54:33.117]  I'm not an engineer or a scientist.
[01:54:33.177 --> 01:54:41.627]  I work in a technical field, but I work with oil refineries, and I've been in there, and that's not something you mess around with.
[01:54:41.707 --> 01:54:48.215]  I mean, if you're walking through and you take your hard hat off and you scratch your head and you get a drop on your head, you better hope that that was condensation.
[01:54:48.957 --> 01:54:50.958]  And not acid, because guess what?
[01:54:50.998 --> 01:54:52.779]  You've got a hole in your skull by the morning.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:55:02.185]  You know, it's, it's, it is a, it's a, there was a great video I saw one time that the Honeywell company put out and it was talking about the great precautions you need to take and why.
[01:55:02.725 --> 01:55:12.071]  And, uh, you know, it's, it's just amazing to me that people, they just want to put their head in the sand and no, no one would ever do anything like that to us.
[01:55:12.151 --> 01:55:12.992]  It can't be true.
[01:55:13.592 --> 01:55:14.653]  And that's why Alex, I just,
[01:55:16.408 --> 01:55:19.210]  When are they going to accept that you're right?
[01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:22.913]  When are they going to admit that, man, this guy, he's got it.
[01:55:23.093 --> 01:55:24.034]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:55:24.054 --> 01:55:29.297]  I mean, everything you do, if you listen, it eventually comes out.
[01:55:29.397 --> 01:55:33.420]  And I tell people all the time, you're where I get my news.
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.122]  And then I cross-reference, and by God, you're right.
[01:55:36.322 --> 01:55:37.163]  Everything is fine.
[01:55:37.183 --> 01:55:38.644]  Well, Tim, I appreciate you, and God bless you.
[01:55:38.944 --> 01:55:39.845]  Please keep spreading the word.
[01:55:39.885 --> 01:55:41.306]  But I don't want to toot my horn here.
[01:55:41.886 --> 01:55:43.788]  Our audience is smarter than I am on most subjects.
[01:55:44.608 --> 01:55:48.070]  It's been known for a hundred years what hydrofluorosilicic acid does.
[01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:50.472]  We've had major industry for 200 plus years.
[01:55:50.512 --> 01:55:50.932]  They've known.
[01:55:51.472 --> 01:55:58.776]  Like you said, in the production of gasoline at the refinery level and before that at the exploration level.
[01:55:58.796 --> 01:56:00.357]  I mean they're dealing with all this toxic stuff.
[01:56:00.858 --> 01:56:06.841]  Everybody knows that's why 100% of the FDA scientists in the mid 90s and again in like 2010 was it?
[01:56:08.991 --> 01:56:16.355]  They got every one of their engineers and toxicologists and chemists to sign a letter saying, take it out of the water.
[01:56:17.875 --> 01:56:18.456]  And you know what?
[01:56:19.096 --> 01:56:23.118]  The feds still push and hold back money to the states if they don't Florida it.
[01:56:23.979 --> 01:56:27.881]  But you go into any rich person's house or any liberal's house, they're not drinking tap water.
[01:56:28.401 --> 01:56:30.522]  But they have all these initiatives about, oh, you should drink it.
[01:56:30.642 --> 01:56:32.583]  Good, good, good.
[01:56:32.963 --> 01:56:34.404]  These are monsters.
[01:56:34.684 --> 01:56:36.505]  They want to kill babies after they're born.
[01:56:37.445 --> 01:56:38.386]  Keep them comfortable.
[01:56:39.617 --> 01:56:42.818]  And so the sooner we come to grips with these monsters, the better.
[01:56:44.738 --> 01:56:50.759]  We'll talk to Alex about Kim's in the water, lowering IQ, making the frogs gay, and I just threw that out there as a pop thing.
[01:56:50.799 --> 01:56:51.460]  It was a headline.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.520]  It was like in Berkeley newspapers, making the frogs gay.
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:56.281]  Literally, they want male frogs, not females.
[01:56:56.541 --> 01:56:59.301]  They go hump male frogs, and there are no babies.
[01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:02.082]  They don't fertilize the eggs, because there's no eggs coming out the...
[01:57:03.106 --> 01:57:05.347]  Rear end of a male frog, and then the frogs die!
[01:57:06.048 --> 01:57:09.429]  But David Hall goes, that's great, I love things being gay!
[01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:10.950]  What does that even mean?
[01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:21.215]  And so when we go to that next caller, I'll show you the article, there's video of it too, of large snakes being raped by gangs of toads and frogs.
[01:57:22.136 --> 01:57:23.397]  It's because of the atrazine.
[01:57:23.437 --> 01:57:24.977]  It drives them mad with lust.
[01:57:25.178 --> 01:57:25.558]  I've got the
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:30.503]  Headline here is, lusting toads gang rape large snake.
[01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:38.589]  And they say the phenomenon is so bad that they'll pile up on them until the snake basically just dies.
[01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:40.811]  There's just all these frogs hopping on it, raping it.
[01:57:42.653 --> 01:57:45.635]  So, frogs are trying to, you know.
[01:57:45.655 --> 01:57:46.876]  It's just, it's incredible what they do.
[01:57:47.877 --> 01:57:49.018]  You'll see the video for yourself.
[01:57:49.038 --> 01:57:49.558]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:52.460]  Thomas.
[01:57:57.475 --> 01:58:11.602]  Every day I walk into the studio and I see all of the people working so hard against the tyranny of the left, against the tyranny of the globalists, and it just makes me think that all of these people are on the same page and they understand.
[01:58:12.242 --> 01:58:15.964]  They are awake to what is actually happening here.
[01:58:16.824 --> 01:58:21.246]  And Alex Jones has created something that is completely remarkable.
[01:58:21.606 --> 01:58:25.727]  People understand that Alex Jones is doing everything he can.
[01:58:25.767 --> 01:58:30.869]  He's putting everything on the line to wake up people and to fight for humanity.
[01:58:31.089 --> 01:58:43.253]  And for me, that is a great honor to be sitting here to try to represent the best of my ability and show my appreciation and say that, you know, InfoWars is a wonderful opportunity for anybody.
[01:58:43.373 --> 01:58:47.915]  Without you supporting InfoWars against what the left is doing, it doesn't happen.
[01:58:48.015 --> 01:58:51.796]  We don't have someone in the pocket like George Soros or Tom Steyer.
[01:58:51.936 --> 01:58:55.397]  All of these filthy rich billionaires that are trying to take out America.
[01:58:55.657 --> 01:58:57.898]  Alex is depending on the American people.
[01:58:57.958 --> 01:59:02.340]  He's depending on all of us to step up and to support InfoWars.com.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:06.481]  And when you share the articles, you tell them that you're not taking it lying down.
[01:59:06.501 --> 01:59:07.782]  You're not going to take it any longer.
[01:59:08.502 --> 01:59:17.568]  By you going to InfowarsStore.com, you show everybody that you love everything that Alex Jones is doing, and you don't believe the lies that's coming out of the left.
[01:59:17.668 --> 01:59:21.451]  That's what it comes down to, is if you believe the lies, then don't buy anything.
[01:59:21.971 --> 01:59:32.538]  But if you believe in humanity, you believe in this country, and you believe everything that Alex Jones has been doing here, then you need to go to InfowarsStore.com and buy the product.
[01:59:32.579 --> 01:59:37.562]  The TurboForce, the BrainForce, the DNAForce, they're always doing specials that's
[01:59:37.862 --> 01:59:38.562]  Unbelievable!
[01:59:38.842 --> 01:59:43.164]  Have you ever seen anyone that's doing a special on their products constantly?
[01:59:43.264 --> 01:59:49.405]  And the main reason why they're doing it is because it gives people the opportunity to find out how good the products really are.
[01:59:49.465 --> 01:59:50.386]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:59:50.706 --> 02:00:00.789]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:13.652 --> 02:00:14.773]  We're taking your phone calls.
[02:00:14.813 --> 02:00:16.114]  Joey Gibson's popping in.
[02:00:16.134 --> 02:00:20.938]  Fresh off the heels of being arrested for daring to go to Portland.
[02:00:22.019 --> 02:00:28.304]  The Proud Boys have been convicted in New York for defending themselves by a sycophantic jury that was told they were the racist.
[02:00:28.925 --> 02:00:30.286]  What are their Nazis in?
[02:00:30.306 --> 02:00:31.967]  15 years in prison?
[02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:35.750]  But right now, we're going back to your phone calls.
[02:00:38.652 --> 02:00:40.454]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Michigan.
[02:00:40.514 --> 02:00:41.195]  Alex, you're on the air.
[02:00:41.235 --> 02:00:41.535]  Welcome.
[02:00:43.038 --> 02:00:44.659]  Thanks so much for taking my call, Alex.
[02:00:44.999 --> 02:00:47.700]  What an honor to be a part of this legendary broadcast today.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.620]  Thank you, sir.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:54.342]  You're doing an amazing job exposing the hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water, mainly from China.
[02:00:55.523 --> 02:01:07.627]  The vaccines causing autism, the chemtrails, the human clones, the GMOs, Big Pharma dumping Prozac in the water, and of course the atrazine and BPA estrogen mimickers turning the frogs gay.
[02:01:09.241 --> 02:01:15.931]  And you have the solution if everyone went to InfoWareStore.com and bought a water filter and the X2 and the bodies.
[02:01:16.071 --> 02:01:19.756]  Actually, there's a lot of studies on turmeric being able to get fluoride out of the brain.
[02:01:19.776 --> 02:01:21.919]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:21.939 --> 02:01:25.644]  I mean, we just promote everything that's super good and we're against everything that's super bad, so...
[02:01:26.564 --> 02:01:27.365]  We like sunshine.
[02:01:27.385 --> 02:01:28.085]  We like green grass.
[02:01:28.125 --> 02:01:28.846]  We like Jesus.
[02:01:28.886 --> 02:01:29.706]  We like America.
[02:01:30.107 --> 02:01:31.147]  We like the Second Amendment.
[02:01:31.187 --> 02:01:32.348]  We like capitalism.
[02:01:32.708 --> 02:01:33.669]  We like the free market.
[02:01:33.689 --> 02:01:34.490]  We like liberty.
[02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:37.812]  And, you know, we don't like chemicals that sterilize us and kill us.
[02:01:38.292 --> 02:01:39.213]  And so that's why we're against this.
[02:01:39.253 --> 02:01:41.455]  I wouldn't say I'm a hero for harping on this.
[02:01:41.595 --> 02:01:48.139]  I just can't believe they've gotten away with this so long when they admit it's designed to literally sterilize us and kill us.
[02:01:49.661 --> 02:01:50.121]  Exactly.
[02:01:50.141 --> 02:01:54.564]  And I know this is a little controversial, but cannabis has been shown to also reverse autism.
[02:01:56.317 --> 02:01:57.638]  Just something to throw out there.
[02:01:57.938 --> 02:02:02.442]  Of course, organic cannabis, none of the George Soros Monsanto pesticide crap out there.
[02:02:03.703 --> 02:02:09.287]  But also, spirulina is a good option, too, if you wanted to add that to the InfoWare store.
[02:02:09.387 --> 02:02:13.350]  Spirulina algae is another solution to get gunk out of your body.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.541]  And I just want to throw this out there, Alex.
[02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:23.542]  If you need help with your InfoWars operation, as a listener and fan, I want to do everything I can to support you.
[02:02:23.582 --> 02:02:26.143]  If you ever need any help, I'll come down there to Texas.
[02:02:26.843 --> 02:02:29.364]  I'll pull a Ted Nugent and work for minimum wage.
[02:02:29.784 --> 02:02:30.124]  I don't care.
[02:02:30.164 --> 02:02:31.304]  I'm kind of a minimalist.
[02:02:32.405 --> 02:02:33.105]  Just throwing it out there.
[02:02:34.289 --> 02:02:39.650]  Well, if we don't get the funding, we might have to do that down the road, but we've kind of got a lean, mean fighting machine right now, and it's not that we don't want help.
[02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:42.951]  It's just that we're trying to get it all developed and all set up.
[02:02:43.451 --> 02:02:51.453]  You know, I found a really, really funny meme page, that whole bunch of Alex Jones gay frog memes, and where Alex Jones is holding back the gay chemicals from everybody.
[02:02:52.013 --> 02:02:54.174]  No, folks, it's funny, but it's not.
[02:02:54.714 --> 02:02:55.614]  But at least it gets
[02:02:56.714 --> 02:02:59.757]  The information out to everybody to have a larger discussion.
[02:03:00.057 --> 02:03:00.797]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:01.158 --> 02:03:05.281]  Let me give folks some viewer discretion is advised.
[02:03:05.942 --> 02:03:08.043]  We're gonna put this up on TV screen for folks.
[02:03:08.704 --> 02:03:15.429]  This is from the CBC and warning this is gay frog rape photos and video.
[02:03:15.809 --> 02:03:16.870]  And I'm not being funny here.
[02:03:17.571 --> 02:03:22.375]  This is a horny confused cane toads are humping a python says biologist.
[02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:27.238]  These cane toads, pictured above, on the back of a python.
[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:34.603]  In Australia, we're actually blind with lust, says the amphibian expert.
[02:03:35.564 --> 02:03:45.111]  And then it goes into how, again, this is happening more and more, because they are dealing with all of the atrazine and the rest of it.
[02:03:45.391 --> 02:03:47.252]  But it's cute and fun to be gay now!
[02:03:47.272 --> 02:03:50.214]  And then, of course, they just die.
[02:03:50.995 --> 02:03:51.755]  But getting serious.
[02:03:54.534 --> 02:03:55.814]  They try to make a joke out of all this.
[02:03:55.894 --> 02:03:56.415]  It's not funny.
[02:03:56.715 --> 02:03:57.695]  Here's CNN.
[02:03:59.556 --> 02:04:01.757]  Once in a while being truthful.
[02:04:01.777 --> 02:04:03.837]  IQ scores are falling and have been for decades.
[02:04:03.877 --> 02:04:04.758]  New study finds.
[02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:11.620]  And again, fluoride is on record as the main cause.
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:13.521]  Why do you think?
[02:04:14.101 --> 02:04:15.061]  These studies are always coming out.
[02:04:15.141 --> 02:04:16.362]  Why is it so big now?
[02:04:17.042 --> 02:04:18.663]  Why would Yahoo put it on the front page now?
[02:04:18.683 --> 02:04:19.763]  Because before they'd hide that.
[02:04:22.102 --> 02:04:23.082]  The study's also the same thing.
[02:04:23.102 --> 02:04:24.283]  I mean, it's conclusive.
[02:04:25.203 --> 02:04:28.904]  Like, shooting yourself in the head with a gun isn't good for you, it probably will kill you at work.
[02:04:29.404 --> 02:04:30.945]  If you take cyanide, it's gonna kill you.
[02:04:31.545 --> 02:04:37.107]  You take a lethal dose of cyanide, a gram of it, you're gonna die.
[02:04:38.327 --> 02:04:44.369]  Well, you drink fluoride, you're gonna have little bitty genitals, and it's gonna eat holes in your brain.
[02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:46.510]  And you're gonna be
[02:04:47.458 --> 02:04:48.219]  Partially sterile.
[02:04:49.079 --> 02:04:50.620]  So, why the hell are they doing it?
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:54.522]  Because they're eugenicists who want you to be dumb so they can out-compete you!
[02:04:55.183 --> 02:04:55.783]  They're jerks!
[02:04:56.203 --> 02:04:56.844]  They're criminals!
[02:04:57.104 --> 02:04:57.724]  They're leftists!
[02:04:57.925 --> 02:04:58.905]  They're devil worshippers!
[02:04:59.205 --> 02:05:00.086]  They're child rapists!
[02:05:00.466 --> 02:05:00.966]  They're evil!
[02:05:03.068 --> 02:05:03.688]  The Globalist?
[02:05:04.569 --> 02:05:07.130]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[02:05:07.791 --> 02:05:09.352]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:19.307]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:05:20.128 --> 02:05:31.077]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:35.961]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:05:36.861 --> 02:05:40.064]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[02:05:40.905 --> 02:05:45.970]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:05:47.811 --> 02:05:49.913]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[02:05:50.734 --> 02:06:00.423]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:12.819 --> 02:06:16.680]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:21.061]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:24.162 --> 02:06:39.467]  So, you have a normal man, just a regular person, not an anointed drag queen story time person, tried to come into the park and ask your kid to sit on her lap and
[02:06:43.069 --> 02:06:43.729]  We're good to go.
[02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:27.660]  And if a man in the park wanted to give your child something that looked like it was pretty blue or pretty pink and had Mickey Mouse or Minnie Mouse or a little mermaid on the front of it, and then you found out that this would lower their IQ, give them a 7 to 50 fold increase in bone cancer,
[02:07:29.335 --> 02:07:30.456]  It's exploded off the chart.
[02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:32.237]  And it's in all the studies right here.
[02:07:32.677 --> 02:07:33.658]  And lower their IQ?
[02:07:34.158 --> 02:07:39.061]  Well, if you caught them doing that before the police got there, you'd beat their ass.
[02:07:40.982 --> 02:07:43.864]  And there isn't a grand jury in the country that wouldn't say, no bill.
[02:07:44.684 --> 02:07:47.846]  He may have knocked that guy's teeth out and broke his jawbone.
[02:07:50.448 --> 02:07:52.830]  But that's what you do to somebody soliciting your child.
[02:07:53.710 --> 02:07:56.372]  Catch them talking to your kid in the back fence about
[02:07:57.372 --> 02:07:58.893]  Hey Junior, pull your pants down.
[02:07:59.533 --> 02:08:00.233]  You're gonna like it.
[02:08:00.994 --> 02:08:01.974]  They get their ass kicked.
[02:08:02.474 --> 02:08:06.456]  But oh, when they do it in the school and it's a big ol' fat man.
[02:08:08.017 --> 02:08:08.958]  Now it's smart.
[02:08:10.879 --> 02:08:14.620]  And when they give you that fluoride, that weapon, you heard the guy calling earlier, he's right.
[02:08:15.061 --> 02:08:21.664]  The stuff they use at the oil refineries to break down oil, break down hard oil, and to separate it out.
[02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:24.822]  If you get a drop of it on you, it can kill you.
[02:08:25.483 --> 02:08:27.384]  And it's not even as strong as what they put in your water.
[02:08:28.864 --> 02:08:36.988]  When they dump hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water supply in Austin, they put on full body suits, and they're about 50 yards away.
[02:08:37.028 --> 02:08:37.969]  We've been there when they do it.
[02:08:37.989 --> 02:08:40.210]  And they turn it, and then they run around the corner.
[02:08:44.252 --> 02:08:45.673]  And they're still all gonna die of cancer.
[02:08:51.112 --> 02:08:55.554]  So, remember that they know what they're doing.
[02:08:59.016 --> 02:09:00.116]  And remember, it's a plan.
[02:09:01.317 --> 02:09:02.618]  And it's the people up on top.
[02:09:02.638 --> 02:09:17.064]  100% of the FDA scientists, over a thousand of them, signed petitions twice in the last 30 years, unanimously saying, pull it out of the water.
[02:09:17.325 --> 02:09:18.105]  Didn't do it, did they?
[02:09:19.565 --> 02:09:20.306]  Because there's a plan.
[02:09:20.326 --> 02:09:22.989]  Have you ever heard the lawyers sue over fluoride?
[02:09:23.009 --> 02:09:24.991]  I mean, it's way worse than glyphosate.
[02:09:25.231 --> 02:09:26.192]  Oh, no, no, no!
[02:09:27.914 --> 02:09:29.896]  Because it's not kosher.
[02:09:30.737 --> 02:09:31.778]  It's not acceptable.
[02:09:32.038 --> 02:09:33.660]  It's verboten.
[02:09:35.182 --> 02:09:36.163]  Forbidden.
[02:09:36.803 --> 02:09:38.545]  And it's all this big mind game.
[02:09:38.565 --> 02:09:41.028]  Because you don't want Forbes to write an article about you.
[02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:43.751]  Saying you're an evil, horrible man.
[02:09:44.152 --> 02:09:45.113]  Big cover story.
[02:09:45.293 --> 02:09:46.554]  Alex Jones is evil.
[02:09:47.074 --> 02:09:51.538]  He says fluoride increases cancer and lowers IQ.
[02:09:52.759 --> 02:09:53.940]  Especially in boys.
[02:09:55.221 --> 02:09:55.862]  And blacks.
[02:09:58.924 --> 02:09:59.865]  Because he's a Nazi.
[02:10:01.967 --> 02:10:03.588]  But it was the Nazis put it in the water.
[02:10:04.770 --> 02:10:05.670]  Of the death camps.
[02:10:07.011 --> 02:10:09.454]  Because it made them more docile.
[02:10:10.848 --> 02:10:14.191]  The Nazis gave it to people in the water way stronger than they put it in our water.
[02:10:15.352 --> 02:10:24.960]  They put it in there not even as strong, though, as is in the candy-flavored toothpaste that everyone knows the kids swallow when mommy isn't looking.
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:28.563]  And then they get real quiet and just kind of fade out all day.
[02:10:28.583 --> 02:10:35.869]  And they get put in special ed because there's a chemical weapon eating their cerebral cortex.
[02:10:38.658 --> 02:10:49.185]  It's gotta be good to put in the tummy because the Little Mermaid who had her voice and her soul stolen like all those other slaves by the evil witch.
[02:10:53.208 --> 02:10:54.829]  And now she's gonna get your kids.
[02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:58.712]  Just like the pedophiles will use a kid to lure kids to the van.
[02:10:59.352 --> 02:11:00.173]  I've got a puppy.
[02:11:00.213 --> 02:11:01.034]  I've got candy.
[02:11:01.574 --> 02:11:02.955]  Come to my van over here.
[02:11:05.417 --> 02:11:07.178]  But instead, it's the Little Mermaid.
[02:11:09.537 --> 02:11:11.479]  Oh, and who else is gonna help you get in the van?
[02:11:11.499 --> 02:11:14.181]  Oh, the little Velociraptor.
[02:11:16.583 --> 02:11:18.604]  Or... Mickey.
[02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:21.306]  Mickey Mouse.
[02:11:22.707 --> 02:11:25.129]  Oh, or the Fruit Explosion Toothpaste.
[02:11:25.469 --> 02:11:27.391]  Tell the little primate, oh, look, it's fruit.
[02:11:27.471 --> 02:11:27.711]  Eat it.
[02:11:29.112 --> 02:11:30.794]  Looks just like one of your yogurt tubes.
[02:11:34.136 --> 02:11:35.838]  Oh, but Junior can't read, though.
[02:11:36.778 --> 02:11:37.339]  Zoom in, please.
[02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:42.213]  Because on the back, it tells you, do not ingest it.
[02:11:43.754 --> 02:11:46.617]  And if you do, call poison control.
[02:11:46.637 --> 02:11:47.877]  Let me put that up on screen for folks.
[02:11:49.679 --> 02:11:50.920]  Type in the toothpaste warning.
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:51.921]  I'm going to go to your calls again.
[02:11:51.941 --> 02:11:52.701]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:11:52.781 --> 02:11:57.865]  This is kind of a big deal, because the question is, why is it suddenly being put in the news?
[02:11:57.965 --> 02:12:00.247]  Because they're moving on to 5G.
[02:12:00.307 --> 02:12:00.367]  Oh.
[02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:08.192]  Hydrofluoric acid is a acid.
[02:12:08.252 --> 02:12:10.233]  It's a, it's a amped up molecule.
[02:12:10.973 --> 02:12:11.634]  It's electrical.
[02:12:12.874 --> 02:12:14.195]  They got something better than electrical.
[02:12:15.336 --> 02:12:19.037]  They gonna microwave us with the 5G, baby!
[02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:21.098]  And they admit out of the gates it kills ya!
[02:12:21.518 --> 02:12:25.440]  So everybody get ready to move on upstairs, cause you gonna be dead!
[02:12:26.341 --> 02:12:26.541]  Woo!
[02:12:28.862 --> 02:12:30.683]  You think you're gonna cut the fluoride out?
[02:12:31.623 --> 02:12:34.945]  We gonna kill yo ass with 5G, baby!
[02:12:37.551 --> 02:12:38.892]  It's a lot of fun dying, isn't it?
[02:12:39.912 --> 02:12:46.016]  Horrible excruciating deaths and having those big ol' yellow fluoride teeth when they come out of your mouth when you're five years old.
[02:12:46.236 --> 02:12:51.899]  Has mommy been dumping that H-E-B fluoride baby formula down your throat?
[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:54.801]  Cause it's the right thing to do!
[02:12:55.822 --> 02:12:57.783]  But we're not gonna have Forbes make fun of us.
[02:12:58.943 --> 02:12:59.824]  Cowardy butts!
[02:13:01.865 --> 02:13:03.346]  Good, good man from Baylor.
[02:13:03.726 --> 02:13:04.807]  Dated my grandma some.
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:11.923]  Why, the head of H-E-B, the founder of H-E-B, if the government says drink fluoride, the baby gonna drink it!
[02:13:14.225 --> 02:13:15.906]  I say, I say, give that baby!
[02:13:16.506 --> 02:13:17.807]  The eye's dimmin' now!
[02:13:19.007 --> 02:13:21.148]  Oh, you got a 70 IQ now!
[02:13:21.989 --> 02:13:23.270]  I give as you a gift!
[02:13:27.012 --> 02:13:28.252]  Say bye-bye, baby!
[02:13:28.272 --> 02:13:33.315]  Let's talk to Eric, California, worked for Water Municipality for 12 years.
[02:13:33.615 --> 02:13:34.335]  Fluoride testimony.
[02:13:34.375 --> 02:13:34.996]  Thanks for calling, sir.
[02:13:36.127 --> 02:13:36.887]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:13:36.907 --> 02:13:37.727]  Long time, first time.
[02:13:37.747 --> 02:13:40.308]  What do you think of the broadcast?
[02:13:40.368 --> 02:13:40.728]  Good, man.
[02:13:40.848 --> 02:13:41.148]  It's good.
[02:13:41.368 --> 02:13:42.489]  It's impactful again.
[02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:44.269]  Is it on target?
[02:13:44.309 --> 02:13:45.370]  Is somebody that worked in this area?
[02:13:46.650 --> 02:13:50.951]  Yeah, well, when I was 23, man, I started over there as a water operator here in the Bay Area.
[02:13:51.451 --> 02:13:58.193]  Not to get into details, but when I first was part of a project, not a project, but a delivery
[02:13:59.159 --> 02:13:59.980]  We're good to go.
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:01.481]  We're good to go.
[02:14:01.521 --> 02:14:02.242]  We're good to go.
[02:14:02.282 --> 02:14:02.862]  We're good to go.
[02:14:02.882 --> 02:14:03.363]  We're good to go.
[02:14:03.443 --> 02:14:03.843]  We're good to go.
[02:14:04.364 --> 02:14:04.884]  We're good to go.
[02:14:04.904 --> 02:14:05.545]  We're good to go.
[02:14:05.565 --> 02:14:06.225]  We're good to go.
[02:14:06.245 --> 02:14:06.746]  We're good to go.
[02:14:06.886 --> 02:14:07.346]  We're good to go.
[02:14:07.386 --> 02:14:07.867]  We're good to go.
[02:14:07.907 --> 02:14:08.287]  We're good to go.
[02:14:08.527 --> 02:14:09.368]  We're good to go.
[02:14:09.448 --> 02:14:10.208]  We're good to go.
[02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.629]  We're good to go.
[02:14:10.649 --> 02:14:11.169]  We're good to go.
[02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.890]  We're good to go.
[02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.951]  We're good to go.
[02:14:12.971 --> 02:14:13.611]  We're good to go.
[02:14:13.631 --> 02:14:14.012]  We're good to go.
[02:14:14.032 --> 02:14:14.652]  We're good to go.
[02:14:14.692 --> 02:14:15.253]  We're good to go.
[02:14:15.273 --> 02:14:15.853]  We're good to go.
[02:14:15.873 --> 02:14:16.194]  We're good to go.
[02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:17.675]  We're good to go.
[02:14:17.695 --> 02:14:18.155]  We're good to go.
[02:14:18.195 --> 02:14:18.816]  We're good to go.
[02:14:18.836 --> 02:14:19.296]  We're good to go.
[02:14:19.356 --> 02:14:20.057]  We're good to go.
[02:14:20.097 --> 02:14:20.938]  We're good to go.
[02:14:20.958 --> 02:14:22.038]  We're good to go.
[02:14:22.078 --> 02:14:22.599]  We're good to go.
[02:14:22.739 --> 02:14:23.279]  We're good to go.
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:23.980]  We're good to go.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:24.641]  We're good to go.
[02:14:24.701 --> 02:14:25.501]  We're good to go.
[02:14:25.521 --> 02:14:25.641]  We're
[02:14:28.506 --> 02:14:34.410]  It came to me and it's like, wow, I'm actually putting this stuff in the water firsthand.
[02:14:34.970 --> 02:14:40.714]  And there was, um, there's these lids on top of our bowl storage tank that are all rusted out.
[02:14:41.154 --> 02:14:49.280]  All the plumbing, we have to go in there and change it out every three to five years because once that stuff gets into the air, it starts eating away at everything.
[02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:51.101]  And you can imagine what it does.
[02:14:51.121 --> 02:14:55.864]  But I mean, yes, it eats steel and concrete, but your child's brain, oh, that's different.
[02:14:57.182 --> 02:15:04.347]  Yeah, I mean, all the guy who delivered the stuff, his hands were all beat up and mangled.
[02:15:04.367 --> 02:15:07.169]  His suit was just a mess.
[02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:13.574]  And it just goes to show that, you know, a lot of people don't realize what this stuff is.
[02:15:13.674 --> 02:15:16.336]  I even asked a customer one day, I'm like, how do you feel about Florida in the water?
[02:15:16.396 --> 02:15:17.537]  Oh, it's the greatest thing.
[02:15:17.717 --> 02:15:18.377]  It's widespread.
[02:15:18.418 --> 02:15:21.460]  I said, I would think twice about it and go do some research.
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:23.121]  And of course, she lived in the country club.
[02:15:23.561 --> 02:15:24.382]  She didn't know any better.
[02:15:25.017 --> 02:15:30.298]  Because she's in the country club while we run the country, and there's nothing wrong here.
[02:15:30.358 --> 02:15:31.298]  Just drink it up.
[02:15:32.339 --> 02:15:37.900]  Yeah, well, hopefully she came across this article today and she realized the conversation she had with me about five, six years ago.
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:40.140]  And she thinks twice about it.
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.101]  But, hey man, keep doing what you're doing, Alex.
[02:15:42.201 --> 02:15:43.601]  Brother, you keep doing it.
[02:15:43.621 --> 02:15:45.322]  You're just as important as I am, or more.
[02:15:45.542 --> 02:15:47.182]  So don't ever forget that.
[02:15:47.242 --> 02:15:47.662]  I mean that.
[02:15:47.702 --> 02:15:49.102]  You're more important than InfoWars.
[02:15:49.542 --> 02:15:50.723]  Because without you, there's nothing.
[02:15:50.803 --> 02:15:51.423]  Remember that.
[02:15:52.349 --> 02:15:54.373]  By the way, it is true that... Sorry sir, go ahead.
[02:15:54.393 --> 02:15:56.456]  The first t-shirt I bought was that InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:15:56.717 --> 02:15:58.119]  Uh, that InfoWars Flo Rida shirt.
[02:15:58.179 --> 02:15:59.341]  The one that has poison in it.
[02:15:59.361 --> 02:16:00.643]  We're gonna bring that shirt back.
[02:16:04.528 --> 02:16:06.489]  There's this weird culture in Google.
[02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:08.631]  They're trying to, like, install this monoculture.
[02:16:08.731 --> 02:16:09.892]  And yes, there are people.
[02:16:09.932 --> 02:16:14.075]  There's kind of a patriot network inside of Google, but they're afraid to come out.
[02:16:14.295 --> 02:16:17.618]  And some of it extends all the way into the executive class.
[02:16:18.338 --> 02:16:31.167]  And so the thing is, is that I felt that if I came forward, that I would galvanize other people by paving a path of disclosure for these documents so that people could come forward and say their opinion without violating the NDA.
[02:16:32.409 --> 02:16:36.136]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[02:16:36.176 --> 02:16:38.441]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[02:16:38.622 --> 02:16:39.463]  This is not a movie.
[02:16:39.483 --> 02:16:40.305]  This is not a drill.
[02:16:40.345 --> 02:16:41.187]  This is not fiction.
[02:16:41.648 --> 02:16:42.951]  This is reality.
[02:16:43.638 --> 02:16:50.423]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[02:16:50.603 --> 02:16:53.665]  Pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[02:16:53.725 --> 02:16:57.087]  You heard him say he hopes to blaze a path to get others to have the courage.
[02:16:57.167 --> 02:16:58.208]  That's leadership.
[02:16:58.288 --> 02:16:59.709]  So, Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[02:16:59.729 --> 02:17:00.409]  And I'll say this.
[02:17:00.649 --> 02:17:01.670]  It's all of our birthright.
[02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:07.474]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[02:17:07.594 --> 02:17:09.775]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[02:17:09.795 --> 02:17:11.096]  We're seeing election meddling.
[02:17:11.497 --> 02:17:13.418]  And it's time to admit it and to realize
[02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:15.639]  We've seen a giant backdoor power grab.
[02:17:15.979 --> 02:17:18.620]  They didn't come like an enemy from over the horizon.
[02:17:19.221 --> 02:17:22.642]  They came from inside, and they came through cyberspace.
[02:17:23.223 --> 02:17:27.785]  Our republic, our constitutional little d democracy has been hacked.
[02:17:28.125 --> 02:17:30.306]  And please remember, without your financial support,
[02:17:31.098 --> 02:17:35.780]  We wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:41.263]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[02:17:41.383 --> 02:17:48.526]  It's the big, giant, 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, but only on 50-something items, not.
[02:17:48.666 --> 02:17:51.748]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 25 years and I've never at a gut level felt the fire of war.
[02:18:14.235 --> 02:18:16.779]  Like I do right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:17.841 --> 02:18:19.584]  So many incredible things are happening.
[02:18:20.225 --> 02:18:22.047]  So many dangerous things are unfolding.
[02:18:22.668 --> 02:18:25.913]  And at a cellular level, at a spiritual gut level,
[02:18:27.304 --> 02:18:45.198]  At the heart of my gut, the heart of my mind, at every level, I can just feel the evil rage of the globalists, knowing that their plan for world government, and their plan for total censorship, and their plan for human-animal clones, and sex with children, and Satanism is in trouble.
[02:18:45.318 --> 02:18:48.601]  It can feel the spirit of Christ coming back into the world.
[02:18:48.621 --> 02:18:49.802]  There's gonna be a tribulation.
[02:18:50.342 --> 02:18:53.665]  During this fight, but the devil knows he's going to lose.
[02:18:53.925 --> 02:18:57.388]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[02:18:57.508 --> 02:18:59.830]  And I can feel Satan's rage.
[02:18:59.970 --> 02:19:00.811]  I know you can feel it.
[02:19:00.891 --> 02:19:02.812]  And they are planning a bloody revolution here.
[02:19:02.973 --> 02:19:05.835]  They're planning massive censorship across the country and the world.
[02:19:05.915 --> 02:19:09.498]  This is a time to be praying to Christ for justice and for freedom.
[02:19:09.618 --> 02:19:12.460]  And that God's spirit come into you and lead God and direct you.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.503]  But it's also time to be politically and culturally active.
[02:19:15.663 --> 02:19:27.606]  And it's time to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and override the AI sensors, to override their systems and to let people know, hey, here's the name that must not be spoken.
[02:19:27.866 --> 02:19:29.106]  Here's what the world fears.
[02:19:29.306 --> 02:19:35.007]  Here's the guest and the information and the history and the analysis that is the cure to the globalist poison.
[02:19:35.127 --> 02:19:35.908]  InfoWars.
[02:19:36.228 --> 02:19:39.969]  Strength lies entirely with you and the action you take.
[02:19:40.229 --> 02:19:41.569]  You are the InfoWars.
[02:19:41.789 --> 02:19:48.235]  You are the resistance, and everything you do now will affect the battle space for billions of lives going to the future.
[02:19:48.895 --> 02:19:51.297]  The war has already begun, quote Patrick Henry.
[02:19:51.838 --> 02:19:53.479]  It's an information and spiritual war.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:57.062]  The enemy's losing that war so they want to make it a physical war.
[02:19:57.603 --> 02:19:58.784]  So prepare yourselves.
[02:19:59.444 --> 02:20:00.205]  You have been warned.
[02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:08.872]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.819 --> 02:20:39.169]  The New York Times, Forbes, CNN, and hundreds of other publications, literally, it's more than that, have come out and attacked me for saying fluoride causes bone cancer, massive reductions in IQ, and massive decreases in fertility.
[02:20:39.249 --> 02:20:42.391]  It's one of the most studied chemicals in world history.
[02:20:43.447 --> 02:20:50.694]  They've known what it does for 200 years because they had to deal with it in chemical manufacturing production.
[02:20:51.375 --> 02:20:54.799]  The only thing studied more would be something like mercury or lead.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.905]  And they knew 200 years ago that people that work with lead or mercury were mad as hatters.
[02:21:01.806 --> 02:21:05.850]  The guys that made hats would stain it with mercury.
[02:21:07.742 --> 02:21:08.202]  Think about that.
[02:21:08.222 --> 02:21:09.443]  Your calls are coming up next segment.
[02:21:09.483 --> 02:21:11.044]  Joey Gibson's been kind enough to join us.
[02:21:11.064 --> 02:21:13.846]  He's the founder of the Patriot Prayer March.
[02:21:14.967 --> 02:21:17.969]  He just saw a bunch of bullies three years ago beating up men, women, and children.
[02:21:18.029 --> 02:21:20.350]  They tried to have gun rallies, property rights rallies.
[02:21:20.490 --> 02:21:25.734]  Antifa would show up all over the Pacific Northwest, down to California.
[02:21:26.926 --> 02:21:32.531]  And famously, Pelosi was out there supporting them in San Francisco, and they attacked even their own crowds.
[02:21:32.771 --> 02:21:34.272]  Even the liberals that came out got attacked by them.
[02:21:34.292 --> 02:21:36.334]  They're such meth-head scum.
[02:21:37.074 --> 02:21:41.398]  Well, now we've seen them attack children, attack people with hammers, and even AP.
[02:21:42.058 --> 02:21:43.199]  I've got the headline here somewhere.
[02:21:43.219 --> 02:21:43.920]  I showed it yesterday.
[02:21:45.241 --> 02:21:52.847]  Admitted that the Patriots were peaceful and that the Antifa was violent, even after the Proud Boys left.
[02:21:54.408 --> 02:21:55.269]  But Joey Gibson,
[02:22:00.202 --> 02:22:03.684]  Joey Gibson, he got arrested.
[02:22:04.804 --> 02:22:08.126]  He got arrested for being there months before and simply doing nothing.
[02:22:09.227 --> 02:22:13.289]  They said inciting a riot because when Antifa was threatening him, he stood his ground.
[02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:15.630]  Remember what Chris Cuomo said?
[02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:18.711]  He said, the Covington kids are bad because they stood their ground.
[02:22:20.272 --> 02:22:29.217]  When a man came over with people yelling that they were going to kill them and genocide them because they were white and beating a drum in their face when they were just there to pick up a bus, get on a bus.
[02:22:31.403 --> 02:22:43.270]  So the mob surrounds our guests, Joey Gibson, and now they're trying to put him in jail.
[02:22:43.310 --> 02:22:52.675]  And it's a perfect time to have him on because Proud Boys, Maxwell Hare and John Kingsman, we already showed the footage the first hour when Gavin McGinnis joins us, founder of the Proud Boys.
[02:22:54.258 --> 02:22:55.379]  They follow him out of their event.
[02:22:55.599 --> 02:22:57.660]  The police escort in, just like Antifa always does.
[02:22:57.940 --> 02:22:59.441]  They try to attack him near their cars.
[02:23:00.081 --> 02:23:01.181]  They simply fight back.
[02:23:01.882 --> 02:23:03.442]  It's a 15-second scrap.
[02:23:04.063 --> 02:23:05.463]  On a scale of 1 to 10, it's like a 2.
[02:23:06.324 --> 02:23:07.725]  Nobody got their teeth knocked out.
[02:23:11.386 --> 02:23:12.747]  And they're facing 15 years.
[02:23:12.867 --> 02:23:16.489]  One of them is already on Rikers Island, where they hold
[02:23:19.178 --> 02:23:20.719]  People from the Mafia.
[02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:21.880]  Hitmen.
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:24.762]  So, this is the new crime.
[02:23:25.162 --> 02:23:32.467]  Joey Gibson, strange days my friend, but congratulations on keeping your chin up and you guys not being violent in the face of those pigs.
[02:23:34.608 --> 02:23:37.769]  Yeah, the organizers, Joe Biggs and Rickey, did a really good job.
[02:23:37.789 --> 02:23:38.510]  I'm really impressed.
[02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:41.151]  They were committed to avoiding the violence.
[02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:44.172]  They understood that the media is going to use that against us.
[02:23:44.432 --> 02:23:46.853]  Shoot, they probably arrested a bunch of people for defending themselves.
[02:23:46.873 --> 02:23:48.874]  You know, I got arrested for not even being violent.
[02:23:49.774 --> 02:23:50.875]  You know, standing on the sidewalk.
[02:23:51.425 --> 02:23:52.405]  And getting pepper sprayed.
[02:23:52.425 --> 02:23:53.706]  I mean, talk about civil rights.
[02:23:53.926 --> 02:23:59.088]  Like, you know, people have been kind of, you know, haven't been really been paying attention to Antifa that much.
[02:23:59.128 --> 02:24:03.589]  They like watching the videos, but they think it's just a bunch of gangs fighting in the streets, so people don't pay attention to it.
[02:24:03.609 --> 02:24:08.191]  But now, you know, this should really wake people up, especially what you're talking about with the two Proud Boys in New York.
[02:24:08.211 --> 02:24:09.071]  They didn't do anything wrong.
[02:24:09.112 --> 02:24:10.312]  We shouldn't be sending these people to prison.
[02:24:11.425 --> 02:24:17.328]  It's very important to understand that Antifa is allowed to go on the streets with batons, like literally, with no masks on, right?
[02:24:17.348 --> 02:24:20.189]  So you can identify them, take it to the cars, right?
[02:24:21.249 --> 02:24:25.411]  Block traffic, like literally start riots, and they don't charge them at all, ever.
[02:24:27.211 --> 02:24:36.215]  And you look at them attacking people with hammers, blooding people inside vehicles, doing all this, you guys don't even fight back, and a lot of the media said that you were the bad guys.
[02:24:36.235 --> 02:24:38.676]  AP actually got it right, which was pretty, pretty amazing.
[02:24:41.055 --> 02:24:49.316]  So when you read through the headlines, most of them say, uh, uh, Proud Boys clash with Antifa or Far Left clashes with Far Right and everything.
[02:24:49.416 --> 02:24:51.357]  But, you know, they don't have any film to show.
[02:24:51.437 --> 02:24:57.558]  All they show is Antifa fighting with the police or Antifa beating on a random guy and his daughter, right?
[02:24:57.958 --> 02:25:00.178]  So they're really trying to manipulate things.
[02:25:00.238 --> 02:25:04.819]  And I know that you talk about this, but it's important for people to understand that this is like exactly what China does.
[02:25:05.099 --> 02:25:06.859]  You know, they manipulate the culture.
[02:25:06.879 --> 02:25:09.820]  They just repeat it over and over and over again until people believe it.
[02:25:10.413 --> 02:25:12.874]  People believe that I'm some far-right extremist.
[02:25:12.934 --> 02:25:14.254]  They believe that I'm racist.
[02:25:14.754 --> 02:25:16.195]  And they believe that I have hate speech.
[02:25:16.475 --> 02:25:18.595]  But they can't find one piece of evidence.
[02:25:19.015 --> 02:25:20.036]  This is the world we live in.
[02:25:20.096 --> 02:25:21.516]  And I know you understand, Alex.
[02:25:21.576 --> 02:25:22.716]  You've got to deal with it more than anybody.
[02:25:22.736 --> 02:25:25.057]  But, you know, I just wish people would do the research.
[02:25:25.237 --> 02:25:25.757]  Open your eyes.
[02:25:25.797 --> 02:25:27.158]  Let's pull people out of the Matrix.
[02:25:27.218 --> 02:25:27.858]  Come on, now.
[02:25:28.178 --> 02:25:30.138]  Like, let's go wake up, United States.
[02:25:30.198 --> 02:25:32.659]  Like, this is our freedom that is under attack.
[02:25:33.019 --> 02:25:35.580]  And all you can think about is that everything is racist.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:36.120]  That's it.
[02:25:37.659 --> 02:26:02.209]  Follow the footage of this girl that could be no more than 10 or 11 and with her dad and they again if you watch the whole footage there's 20 minutes of it they follow them while they're trying to get to their car he wasn't there looking for trouble he came out to exercise free speech and they wait like cowards and they're even attacking her she got taser but the taser didn't go in they threw mace on them pepper spray I mean this is just imagine if a Republican or a proud boy was doing this to somebody a huge horde of
[02:26:02.409 --> 02:26:07.975]  White meth heads, because they keep saying everybody's racist, it's almost all white people, chasing down a white guy and his daughter.
[02:26:08.056 --> 02:26:10.939]  I mean, if Radio Lizards can't see this, it's on Infowars.com.
[02:26:10.979 --> 02:26:11.680]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:26:13.513 --> 02:26:14.134]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:14.154 --> 02:26:15.635]  And this is what I tell reporters all the time.
[02:26:15.655 --> 02:26:19.259]  I said, because everyone keeps talking about the white supremacist movement, the white nationalist movement.
[02:26:19.319 --> 02:26:28.828]  And I say, listen, if there's a thousand white supremacists running through the streets, beating up people on the left because of their speech, like I would be there to stand up for the Democrats.
[02:26:29.168 --> 02:26:30.750]  I would be there to stand up for the liberals.
[02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:34.894]  I don't understand why it's so hard for the left to disavow Antifa.
[02:26:35.294 --> 02:26:39.120]  Like, are you that afraid, or do you just believe that their behavior is okay?
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:43.887]  Because these guys are literally acting like how racists treated black people back in the day.
[02:26:44.047 --> 02:26:44.848]  Like, it's identical.
[02:26:45.249 --> 02:26:47.332]  They're acting like how Nazis want to treat Jews.
[02:26:47.572 --> 02:26:51.378]  So, it's just amazing that everything they say they're against, but that's how they're acting.
[02:26:52.369 --> 02:26:54.490]  It's like that, what was that show?
[02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:57.251]  I think it was an MTV show back when they still had some good shows, a comedy.
[02:26:57.991 --> 02:27:03.513]  And it's the Nazis sitting around going, well we're in black uniforms, we have skulls on, maybe we're the baddies.
[02:27:04.034 --> 02:27:10.736]  And if you look at them, they are so bad and so villainous, and so cowardly attacking women, children, people in wheelchairs.
[02:27:11.156 --> 02:27:15.858]  I notice they don't ever want to attack big guys like you, unless they have like a club or something, they still get their ass kicked.
[02:27:16.339 --> 02:27:19.880]  But they target women and children, or like a little gay Asian dude.
[02:27:21.846 --> 02:27:22.726]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:27:22.826 --> 02:27:31.970]  And I love to target minorities because I have a guy that goes down to school down in one of the two-year universities in the Bay Area by UC Berkeley.
[02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:36.312]  That's where the professor who used the bike lock, that's where he taught.
[02:27:36.832 --> 02:27:40.953]  This kid that came out of school said they kicked him out for so-called racism, even though he's Indian.
[02:27:41.834 --> 02:27:45.455]  He said they specifically target conservatives who are of color.
[02:27:46.064 --> 02:27:47.245]  So they're literally racists.
[02:27:47.265 --> 02:27:51.787]  Like, they're literally trying to find people of color or people who are, you know, gay.
[02:27:51.807 --> 02:27:53.448]  Yeah, they're bullying and telling people what they can do.
[02:27:53.508 --> 02:27:59.752]  And there's also footage of white guys calling black guys racial terms because they're cops.
[02:27:59.852 --> 02:28:02.213]  I mean, they don't even believe in borders, police, anything.
[02:28:02.233 --> 02:28:03.094]  Of course they do.
[02:28:03.514 --> 02:28:04.874]  They want full control.
[02:28:04.915 --> 02:28:06.095]  Let's play this audio as we go to break.
[02:28:06.135 --> 02:28:06.435]  Here it is.
[02:28:07.396 --> 02:28:08.316]  Look at that too, man.
[02:28:08.376 --> 02:28:09.117]  Out on the street!
[02:28:10.365 --> 02:28:13.406]  You really can sleep at night?
[02:28:13.426 --> 02:28:15.767]  That's so sickening.
[02:28:16.027 --> 02:28:18.008]  That is so sickening.
[02:28:18.088 --> 02:28:20.088]  He probably did it.
[02:28:20.209 --> 02:28:22.429]  Look at this kid.
[02:28:22.729 --> 02:28:23.550]  Oh, even worse.
[02:28:23.890 --> 02:28:26.471]  Look at that kid.
[02:28:26.531 --> 02:28:31.873]  They called him all sorts of names.
[02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:34.412]  They're truly the scum of the earth.
[02:28:34.452 --> 02:28:35.113]  Joey, we're going to break.
[02:28:35.133 --> 02:28:40.757]  We'll come back and take some calls with you on a whole subject, a whole bunch of subjects, but one word to define Antifa.
[02:28:41.078 --> 02:28:42.599]  I want to get your take on that when we come back.
[02:28:42.979 --> 02:28:44.721]  Patriot-Prayer.com.
[02:28:44.801 --> 02:28:45.482]  Joey gives us our guest.
[02:28:45.822 --> 02:28:48.804]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWords.com, InfoWars.com.
[02:28:48.844 --> 02:28:50.826]  If you don't share these links, nobody will.
[02:28:51.567 --> 02:28:52.648]  It's not just on my shoulders.
[02:28:52.708 --> 02:28:54.710]  I'm just telling you, you are the resistance.
[02:28:55.290 --> 02:28:56.451]  You are everything.
[02:28:56.951 --> 02:28:58.633]  And if you don't take action, we're going to lose.
[02:28:58.653 --> 02:29:00.675]  If you take action, we're unstoppable.
[02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:03.661]  This is important.
[02:29:05.002 --> 02:29:06.164]  I'm 45 years old.
[02:29:07.305 --> 02:29:10.289]  When I was 35, I swam up to 2 miles a day sometimes.
[02:29:10.929 --> 02:29:11.851]  And would jog.
[02:29:12.511 --> 02:29:13.312]  And couldn't lose weight.
[02:29:14.212 --> 02:29:16.774]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[02:29:16.954 --> 02:29:21.538]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:27.403]  I knew all about the Private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[02:29:27.704 --> 02:29:32.648]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Tchaikovs in.
[02:29:32.848 --> 02:29:34.590]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:36.591]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[02:29:37.752 --> 02:29:39.113]  I didn't know about all this.
[02:29:39.914 --> 02:29:41.556]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[02:29:42.654 --> 02:29:44.216]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[02:29:45.337 --> 02:29:53.585]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[02:29:54.386 --> 02:30:00.472]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[02:30:00.492 --> 02:30:01.993]  Let me tell you something right now.
[02:30:03.315 --> 02:30:04.136]  You see DNA Force?
[02:30:05.225 --> 02:30:06.805]  I went out to top manufacturers.
[02:30:06.845 --> 02:30:08.646]  They're the most respected, most highly tested.
[02:30:09.426 --> 02:30:18.508]  And I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[02:30:19.468 --> 02:30:21.989]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:24.209]  I said, I want to put $50 a model in it.
[02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:26.250]  They said, nobody's ever done that.
[02:30:26.889 --> 02:30:29.570]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was going to buy.
[02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:33.091]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:34.771]  Nobody does that!
[02:30:35.672 --> 02:30:41.953]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this and you research every ingredient in this and then you experience it for yourself.
[02:30:42.814 --> 02:30:43.514]  It's incredible.
[02:30:45.453 --> 02:30:56.217]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[02:30:56.817 --> 02:30:59.258]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:31:05.874 --> 02:31:07.076]  William in Florida.
[02:31:07.636 --> 02:31:08.557]  William, you're on the air.
[02:31:08.597 --> 02:31:08.978]  Go ahead.
[02:31:09.058 --> 02:31:09.819]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:31:09.859 --> 02:31:10.760]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:11.501]  Thanks for calling.
[02:31:11.541 --> 02:31:14.224]  Before I get into my points, I want to plug a couple of products.
[02:31:14.284 --> 02:31:15.606]  First off, the Immune Wall.
[02:31:15.646 --> 02:31:16.747]  You don't mention it very much.
[02:31:16.767 --> 02:31:18.029]  It helps keep me healthy.
[02:31:18.249 --> 02:31:20.992]  I work in an environment where I'm exposed to the public.
[02:31:21.012 --> 02:31:23.215]  And of course, you know, everything that comes along with that.
[02:31:23.255 --> 02:31:23.916]  I stay healthy with that.
[02:31:26.478 --> 02:31:27.059]  Well, thank you.
[02:31:27.359 --> 02:31:35.225]  For those that don't know, you've got things like emergency and you've got things like airport or whatever it's called that, you know, that people take and those things have some good things in them.
[02:31:35.305 --> 02:31:40.709]  When we did immune wall, I'm like, what's three times stronger than any other immune support formula?
[02:31:40.729 --> 02:31:42.391]  They're like, okay, we can make this.
[02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:46.514]  And so anything we make is just chocked full of the very best things.
[02:31:46.894 --> 02:31:50.077]  And yes, the super silver wound gel is a natural
[02:31:50.097 --> 02:31:56.603]  National brand, patented, FDA approved, used at hospitals, used over the counter, $40 a tube.
[02:31:56.763 --> 02:31:59.226]  We have to pay like $13 or something a tube.
[02:31:59.306 --> 02:32:01.167]  For folks who don't know, it's like gloves.
[02:32:01.308 --> 02:32:07.994]  Put a tiny bit on your hands, rub it, and then it's a preemptive wall of the strongest silver allowed by the FDA over the counter.
[02:32:08.214 --> 02:32:08.894]  I'll be very clear.
[02:32:09.154 --> 02:32:10.795]  Do not ingest it, okay?
[02:32:10.835 --> 02:32:12.195]  It's very toxic.
[02:32:12.216 --> 02:32:13.596]  But, I mean, it's weaponized.
[02:32:13.676 --> 02:32:15.177]  It's the strongest silver over-the-counter.
[02:32:15.277 --> 02:32:19.698]  But bacteria, viruses, it's approved and proven to kill them better than a hammer.
[02:32:19.998 --> 02:32:24.420]  Since you mentioned it, my friend, what experience have you had with a super silver wound gel?
[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:33.287]  Everything from minor burns to actually take out a little sloppy in the kitchen one day, and I normally turn my, when I'm chopping stuff, I turn the knife away from me.
[02:32:33.307 --> 02:32:33.987]  I didn't do that.
[02:32:34.007 --> 02:32:34.528]  I was in a hurry.
[02:32:34.568 --> 02:32:38.110]  I couldn't reach for the knife, and I cut my finger right down to the bone.
[02:32:38.290 --> 02:32:48.458]  It was bleeding pretty good, and I put the super-silver wound gel on that and wrapped it, of course, and in less than four hours, the pain was gone, and in a day, the deepest part of the cut was already healing up.
[02:32:48.718 --> 02:32:58.269]  It is the best wound gel out there, and I've tried to haggle them down on the price, but after the patents and the FDA approval took them like nine years, this is the thing used in hospitals.
[02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:59.690]  So we're very, very proud of it.
[02:32:59.750 --> 02:33:00.871]  So thanks for the plug, William.
[02:33:05.657 --> 02:33:08.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.602 --> 02:33:27.344]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[02:33:28.185 --> 02:33:29.867]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:55.831 --> 02:33:56.071]  We're good.
[02:34:19.557 --> 02:34:27.199]  Recently, President Trump launched a new offensive against progressives by drawing attention to the decrepit state of major leftist-run cities.
[02:34:27.259 --> 02:34:28.939]  Wonder where he got that idea from?
[02:34:28.979 --> 02:34:30.560]  But forget about Baltimore.
[02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:33.040]  If Baltimore was a toilet, L.A.
[02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:35.041]  would be a 500-acre landfill.
[02:34:35.241 --> 02:34:35.441]  L.A.
[02:34:35.501 --> 02:34:39.642]  can truly lay claim to the accolade of being king of the s**tholes.
[02:34:39.682 --> 02:34:44.443]  There are now an estimated 60,000 homeless people living on the streets of L.A.
[02:34:44.503 --> 02:34:47.644]  That's a 75% rise in homelessness since 2012.
[02:34:48.524 --> 02:34:50.325]  Did you ever see, uh, I Am Legend?
[02:34:50.405 --> 02:34:50.605]  Yes.
[02:34:50.705 --> 02:34:50.946]  Okay.
[02:34:50.966 --> 02:34:53.968]  Remember when all the f***ing crazy zombie people were running at once?
[02:34:54.068 --> 02:34:54.288]  Yeah.
[02:34:54.408 --> 02:34:54.968]  That's what it's like.
[02:34:54.988 --> 02:34:55.649]  Are you serious?
[02:34:55.909 --> 02:34:57.890]  I'm telling you, you can't believe the volume.
[02:34:57.910 --> 02:35:03.874]  To illustrate the homeless problem, look at this comparison between 2015 and 2017.
[02:35:04.595 --> 02:35:10.138]  Look at the increase in trash and tents in a period of little over two years.
[02:35:10.178 --> 02:35:11.940]  And what's the mayor's solution?
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:14.041]  To paint murals of homeless people.
[02:35:14.101 --> 02:35:16.743]  Because painting a mural of people who can't afford...
[02:35:20.353 --> 02:35:22.001]  I stepped on my headset cord.
[02:35:23.152 --> 02:35:25.173]  And broke it so I had to find a new one.
[02:35:56.514 --> 02:36:01.016]  One of the things too is, you know, the big government is about bringing as much money as you can, right?
[02:36:01.056 --> 02:36:07.059]  So they convince the folks to bring in a bunch of taxes, but then they don't want to use that money to go clean up the streets and clean up their problems, right?
[02:36:07.379 --> 02:36:10.340]  They want to use that money to go to special contracts or wherever that money goes.
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:16.243]  I always tell people this, that, you know, they go up on that grandstand and say, hey, we need raises for teachers, right?
[02:36:16.283 --> 02:36:22.346]  So they increase taxes and like 5% of it goes to the teachers, 95% of it disappears to a bunch of different, you know, special interests.
[02:36:24.724 --> 02:36:29.689]  How bad do you think it's going to get, and when do you think Trump is going to declare them a terrorist organization?
[02:36:29.729 --> 02:36:40.260]  Because I'm all for free speech, but when you organize and say your mission is to stop other people's speech using violence and to make them politically submit to you, that's the textbook definition of terrorism.
[02:36:41.693 --> 02:36:57.604]  As soon as he gets evidence that there's money coming in from outside the country, as soon as he gets evidence that certain organizations like CARE that work hand-in-hand with Antifa, as soon as he gets evidence that the Chinese are involved in this, I think that that's when he can push really hard on it.
[02:36:57.704 --> 02:37:04.309]  Because we literally have outside forces of this country that are funding and pushing this division in our country, especially with the media.
[02:37:04.629 --> 02:37:07.211]  The media is not owned by this country, alright?
[02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:08.312]  Let's make that very clear.
[02:37:08.692 --> 02:37:09.353]  And the media
[02:37:09.833 --> 02:37:14.316]  Overwhelmingly supports Antifa or is completely silent on their behavior, right?
[02:37:14.336 --> 02:37:17.919]  It's just unbelievable how much they justify their behavior.
[02:37:18.199 --> 02:37:27.906]  Just like that lady who went on national television on CNN and was saying that Trump sided with the Nazis instead of siding with the peaceful protesters, which she was referring to Antifa.
[02:37:28.426 --> 02:37:30.568]  So, like you said, it's clown world.
[02:37:31.243 --> 02:37:32.344]  They do it over and over again.
[02:37:32.364 --> 02:37:36.828]  I want to get you back on later this week to give us your take on Hong Kong.
[02:37:36.848 --> 02:37:43.253]  We're going to have some reporters that I'm talking to over in Hong Kong that are going to be popping in because the word is that is heating up very, very quickly.
[02:37:43.293 --> 02:37:47.657]  I've been talking to some of the British connected folks in the government.
[02:37:48.218 --> 02:37:50.539]  You know, there's obviously a couple different factions over there.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:52.521]  We're going to be looking at that very, very soon.
[02:37:52.821 --> 02:37:55.043]  Joey Gibson, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:37:56.485 --> 02:37:56.725]  Thank you.
[02:37:57.438 --> 02:37:58.478]  All right, there goes Joey Gibson.
[02:37:58.518 --> 02:38:00.939]  I promised to get to your calls, so I appreciate you holding.
[02:38:00.959 --> 02:38:08.342]  We're going to get to everybody now before this hour ends, or we're going to go into the next hour to take care of it.
[02:38:08.362 --> 02:38:10.483]  But Mike Adams is loaded for bear, as always.
[02:38:10.503 --> 02:38:15.364]  There's a lot of other news I haven't hit yet that I also want to try to cram in with Mike, so I'll probably just co-host with him.
[02:38:15.704 --> 02:38:19.206]  Some know I have a dental appointment today.
[02:38:22.387 --> 02:38:25.308]  NPR reported that all my teeth were knocked out when I was a teenager.
[02:38:26.237 --> 02:38:30.799]  Because I was tied up by children I bullied and taken to a field, and all my teeth were knocked out.
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:32.200]  I just always loved that.
[02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:40.704]  I offered to go have my teeth looked at, that I've never had a tooth knocked out, and they did not do it, because they're a pack of criminal liars.
[02:38:41.285 --> 02:38:45.927]  And again, then they run with that in hundreds of articles about my ethos, that I'm a bully.
[02:38:47.368 --> 02:38:52.851]  No, you, the left, are a bunch of pedophile-backing, Islamic-backing scum.
[02:38:55.504 --> 02:38:55.964]  Unbelievable.
[02:38:56.004 --> 02:38:58.906]  And you always want to get into countries that have some semblance of freedom.
[02:38:59.226 --> 02:39:08.051]  Because next time, I'm going to play a clip of it, Tlaib crying and saying, my grandmother couldn't get into Israel for health care.
[02:39:10.152 --> 02:39:11.393]  She's not an Israeli citizen.
[02:39:12.533 --> 02:39:14.454]  But Tlaib says, we need open borders.
[02:39:14.554 --> 02:39:15.235]  Everyone come here.
[02:39:15.255 --> 02:39:16.055]  Free stuff.
[02:39:16.796 --> 02:39:18.997]  But you can't come to that fat ass's house.
[02:39:19.983 --> 02:39:21.204]  And ask her to give you some money.
[02:39:21.244 --> 02:39:21.524]  She won't.
[02:39:21.845 --> 02:39:26.069]  It's like Maxine Waters buys a book from a homeless woman who's trying to help Skid Row.
[02:39:26.829 --> 02:39:29.972]  Acts like she's done a good job and smiles like she's this good, great person.
[02:39:30.173 --> 02:39:31.093]  She's a sociopath.
[02:39:31.614 --> 02:39:32.355]  Probably a psychopath.
[02:39:32.715 --> 02:39:33.716]  Doesn't know how dumb it looks.
[02:39:34.136 --> 02:39:35.578]  And then goes, I need change for my 20!
[02:39:35.618 --> 02:39:35.898]  I need $10!
[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:43.341]  You should have given her the whole 20, you stupid witch, or said, I'm going to take you to Congress for a tour.
[02:39:43.701 --> 02:39:47.002]  We're going to promote what you're doing and try to get some private citizens there to help.
[02:39:47.042 --> 02:39:49.222]  But no, instead she just, I'm helping everybody.
[02:39:49.242 --> 02:39:50.243]  We're going to play that next hour.
[02:39:51.403 --> 02:39:52.223]  That's a cue to get the video.
[02:39:53.283 --> 02:40:00.645]  And waving the money around, that's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:40:00.925 --> 02:40:05.206]  This is all rivetingly poignant stuff that really illustrates
[02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:08.551]  The type of nutcases we're dealing with.
[02:40:08.571 --> 02:40:14.054]  I mean, I couldn't imagine talking to a woman trying to pull the homeless out and publish her own book and slipping on the street.
[02:40:14.375 --> 02:40:21.679]  She's trying to provide tents for people and mental health with the money she made off a book and Maxine Waters wouldn't give her $20 for it.
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:24.201]  And smiles and goes, look how good I am.
[02:40:24.301 --> 02:40:24.902]  I'm helping.
[02:40:25.262 --> 02:40:25.602]  Yeah.
[02:40:25.622 --> 02:40:27.603]  How many, what's your husband's still 30 million?
[02:40:27.623 --> 02:40:32.286]  Was it in two different swindles, a taxpayer money right to his own damn bank.
[02:40:33.507 --> 02:40:35.008]  But look, I'm going to give this lady $10.
[02:40:37.617 --> 02:40:38.757]  I'm so nice.
[02:40:39.918 --> 02:40:41.338]  What a freakazoid, man.
[02:40:43.458 --> 02:40:44.519]  Fake is a $3 bill.
[02:40:46.739 --> 02:40:48.580]  Okay, back to the Coles, my friends.
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:50.820]  I just ranted a whole other segment, didn't I?
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:53.101]  Oh no, Joey was on with us.
[02:40:56.662 --> 02:40:57.042]  Who's we got?
[02:40:57.062 --> 02:40:58.082]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:40:58.102 --> 02:41:01.143]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[02:41:01.963 --> 02:41:03.143]  Jefferson's been holding the longest.
[02:41:03.183 --> 02:41:04.484]  Jefferson and Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:41:04.524 --> 02:41:05.064]  Thank you, go ahead.
[02:41:06.718 --> 02:41:07.762]  Thank you for letting me on, Alex.
[02:41:08.144 --> 02:41:08.967]  Thank you for calling?
[02:41:08.987 --> 02:41:09.489]  Are you kidding?
[02:41:11.286 --> 02:41:17.570]  Joey Gibson and the Proud Boys are in a bind because they get over-prosecuted for simply protecting themselves.
[02:41:17.610 --> 02:41:18.770]  The President and A.G.
[02:41:18.831 --> 02:41:20.091]  Barr need to step in on this.
[02:41:20.391 --> 02:41:25.334]  This is ridiculous that these people get charged and sometimes convicted of things they didn't even really do.
[02:41:25.454 --> 02:41:25.795]  Exactly.
[02:41:25.835 --> 02:41:32.419]  We need the FBI to go for an indictment of the day-long threats and harassment for two days that stopped them at a bunch of venues.
[02:41:32.439 --> 02:41:33.279]  They finally get a venue.
[02:41:33.519 --> 02:41:35.981]  They come and promise to kill the cops, attack them.
[02:41:36.001 --> 02:41:37.862]  Then the cops have to leave them alone.
[02:41:37.882 --> 02:41:39.723]  And then they get attacked and then they go to jail.
[02:41:41.741 --> 02:41:42.542]  Yeah, it's gotten nuts.
[02:41:42.602 --> 02:41:50.668]  I mean, I'm no fan of what happened in Charlottesville, but that guy James Field, he got convicted of first-degree murder, like he planned to kill Heather Heyer.
[02:41:50.688 --> 02:41:51.569]  Yeah, premeditated.
[02:41:53.055 --> 02:41:53.475]  Right.
[02:41:53.495 --> 02:41:54.296]  That's ridiculous.
[02:41:54.396 --> 02:41:57.319]  No, he freaked out with them beating on the car and then she had a heart attack and died.
[02:41:57.359 --> 02:41:57.959]  It's very sad.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:01.963]  Then they sued me saying I said that the cameraman killed her.
[02:42:02.043 --> 02:42:05.566]  No, I said the left came in with all their people to clash with this.
[02:42:05.806 --> 02:42:07.227]  A lot of those Nazis were staged.
[02:42:07.508 --> 02:42:11.031]  That's come out to create a melee hoping something bad happened.
[02:42:11.611 --> 02:42:17.897]  But then they're like in court going, Jones says this man himself killed the... I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:20.590]  And it's all this racism thing.
[02:42:20.830 --> 02:42:22.651]  Same reason they put the Proud Boys in jail.
[02:42:23.391 --> 02:42:24.952]  15 years, Rikers Island's what they're facing.
[02:42:25.232 --> 02:42:27.374]  Because they told the jury, they're a KKK group.
[02:42:27.754 --> 02:42:28.914]  And the jury went, ooooh.
[02:42:29.195 --> 02:42:31.336]  And didn't even care that they showed it wasn't true.
[02:42:32.136 --> 02:42:34.318]  They wanted to prove they weren't Nazis.
[02:42:34.978 --> 02:42:36.679]  So it's the same thing with this judge in Virginia.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.662]  I mean, literally, they just go in there and they say, Jones says that, uh...
[02:42:42.642 --> 02:42:46.303]  That the same people at this event did the stuff in Ukraine.
[02:42:46.343 --> 02:42:47.203]  We didn't say that.
[02:42:47.783 --> 02:42:50.644]  We say Soros funded both groups, which he did.
[02:42:50.984 --> 02:42:51.264]  Stay there.
[02:42:51.284 --> 02:42:52.244]  I'm gonna come right back to you.
[02:42:52.404 --> 02:42:53.365]  Don't hang up, Jefferson.
[02:42:53.665 --> 02:42:55.165]  Everybody else's calls coming up!
[02:42:56.685 --> 02:42:57.005]  Woo!
[02:42:57.045 --> 02:43:00.226]  That's the name of the game!
[02:43:01.987 --> 02:43:03.087]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:43:08.268 --> 02:43:09.128]  This is history.
[02:43:10.109 --> 02:43:11.369]  We've got two
[02:43:12.603 --> 02:43:26.211]  Google engineers that have the courage to go public, the first one and the second one, others have just leaked stuff, and they're there together interfacing for the first time live on an alternative system that Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple didn't want to exist.
[02:43:26.371 --> 02:43:30.474]  They knew it would threaten them in the future if it was here to challenge their information dominance.
[02:43:30.694 --> 02:43:31.655]  And history's happening.
[02:43:31.695 --> 02:43:38.519]  That's why listeners and viewers buying products, going to the store, getting things you already need at InfoWareStore.com is the reason this is happening.
[02:43:39.099 --> 02:43:40.100]  You guys have the floor.
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:46.044]  Both of you, Zach Voorhees on Twitter, Perpetual Maniac, Greg Coppola on Twitter for now, and Coppola underscore Gregory.
[02:43:46.084 --> 02:43:47.265]  What do you think is coming next?
[02:43:47.405 --> 02:43:48.405]  Why did you go public?
[02:43:48.505 --> 02:43:50.067]  Obviously, more whistleblowers are coming.
[02:43:50.127 --> 02:43:53.669]  This is an amazing watershed moment, so go ahead and take over.
[02:43:53.849 --> 02:44:02.175]  Yeah, so about six years I was asleep within the company, and then the last two years it was fully awake, and that process started.
[02:44:02.795 --> 02:44:07.959]  And once it started, you know, I remember the last thing thinking to myself, what else are they lying about?
[02:44:08.759 --> 02:44:09.380]  And that was it.
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:09.801]  Wow.
[02:44:09.881 --> 02:44:10.561]  You know, bam.
[02:44:10.802 --> 02:44:11.582]  It just came.
[02:44:11.783 --> 02:44:20.011]  And for two years, I was really, really, really suffering being inside of YouTube and Google and seeing the company transform like this.
[02:44:20.272 --> 02:44:23.555]  I felt really guilty about drawing a salary.
[02:44:23.895 --> 02:44:27.820]  And I tried to let people know that this was coming.
[02:44:28.801 --> 02:44:35.547]  And now that I've released all of the information, I realize I'm not part of that evil, evil system anymore.
[02:44:36.287 --> 02:44:42.873]  And it's very uplifting, and I feel that I can, you know, meet my maker at the very end.
[02:44:43.053 --> 02:44:46.456]  And when he says, you came across evil, what did you do?
[02:44:46.777 --> 02:44:54.664]  And I'll be able to like look him right in the eye and say, I sacrificed everything to let the American people know that the AI weapons were pointed directly at their minds.
[02:44:54.924 --> 02:45:02.526]  You know, I think when I was comfortably drawing my paycheck, I felt, you know, more comfortable, more certain.
[02:45:02.546 --> 02:45:07.367]  Now I feel there's definitely a lot of uncertainty, but I feel more alert.
[02:45:07.547 --> 02:45:11.408]  And obviously, you know, just the fact that I'm not anonymous kind of makes life a little more dangerous.
[02:45:11.488 --> 02:45:13.589]  It's just kind of actually making me a little bit more awake.
[02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:17.811]  First of all, I'm really curious when they're gonna admit that Zach's leaks have happened.
[02:45:17.911 --> 02:45:19.672]  I mean, like, I mean, I'm talking about the mainstream media here.
[02:45:19.812 --> 02:45:28.696]  You know, that could be an interesting thing, and just, like, what's gonna happen when they have to say, you know, this actually happened weeks ago, uh, that Zach leaked all these things, and we just didn't tell you, and these...
[02:45:29.216 --> 02:45:32.399]  You know, they're alleging that there's a system of censorship and we didn't tell you about it for two weeks.
[02:45:32.559 --> 02:45:35.141]  I mean, is that gonna kind of get anyone thinking?
[02:45:35.181 --> 02:45:35.602]  I don't know.
[02:45:36.423 --> 02:45:39.966]  And secondly, I think, you know, I would just underline that with Zach Stump.
[02:45:40.026 --> 02:45:41.647]  I mean, I think you've really seen everything now.
[02:45:41.707 --> 02:45:43.489]  It's all, I don't even think we need another leak.
[02:45:43.529 --> 02:45:49.854]  I mean, I'm sure some people are looking for it and some people might leak other things that are interesting, but I actually don't even think that we need anything else.
[02:45:49.914 --> 02:45:52.957]  And I think it's really important for consumers to just say like,
[02:45:53.767 --> 02:45:54.648]  Uh, look, there's a bias.
[02:45:54.688 --> 02:45:55.208]  We can see it.
[02:45:55.248 --> 02:45:56.248]  Everything's set by hand.
[02:45:56.268 --> 02:45:57.569]  It's nothing to do with computers at all.
[02:45:58.169 --> 02:45:58.910]  And... Well, that's it.
[02:45:58.950 --> 02:46:02.972]  You just said something... God, I love talking to you guys with 150 IQs.
[02:46:03.352 --> 02:46:15.679]  Because, exactly, everybody's always the next dump, the next piece, the next... What do you need when you have them saying blacklist and they've lied to Congress and said there aren't specific names, my names and others' names?
[02:46:15.819 --> 02:46:17.560]  It's all right there.
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:18.500]  We have them.
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:21.942]  It's a pile of smoky guns as big as Mount Everest is what you're saying.
[02:46:22.042 --> 02:46:30.129]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the meme where there's like a dog in the building and everything's on fire and he's just, you know, saying, oh, yeah, everything's fine.
[02:46:30.209 --> 02:46:32.952]  You know, the American people have had a fire woken up in them.
[02:46:33.172 --> 02:46:37.976]  And I think that they're really going to, you know, have a conversation with the representative.
[02:46:38.457 --> 02:46:44.202]  And, you know, that representative is going to come back from recess and they're going to be energized.
[02:46:44.782 --> 02:46:48.285]  To, you know, start working through what the solutions are.
[02:46:48.305 --> 02:46:49.806]  This is history making.
[02:46:49.866 --> 02:46:56.491]  Two senior Google engineers at a whistleblown, the first two, publicly coming together live on InfoWars.
[02:46:56.791 --> 02:47:00.874]  If that isn't radioactive kryptonite to tyranny, I don't know what the hell is.
[02:47:06.639 --> 02:47:09.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:45.339 --> 02:47:47.862]  I'll have one of your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:47:47.882 --> 02:47:53.149]  But since I mentioned Maxine Waters, it's one thing to hear me talk about her at Skid Row.
[02:47:54.290 --> 02:47:56.954]  But if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners will hear her voice.
[02:47:56.994 --> 02:48:02.481]  But if you see her, you just really pick up on she's so proud just like she won the blue ribbon.
[02:48:03.689 --> 02:48:18.055]  She's such a good person, and she's doing this good deed, even though it's the blue cities where the people are doing so bad and where they set it up to bring in people and to cater to the drug addicts and all of it, to create as big an eyesore as they can to get more funding.
[02:48:18.375 --> 02:48:28.380]  She knows damn well what she's doing, and she's such a greedy monster that swindles taxpayers for decades, hundreds of millions of dollars, her husband 30 plus million in two different scams, that they admit.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:31.201]  But because she's black, they don't dare indict her.
[02:48:32.554 --> 02:48:34.176]  It's incredible how the left operates.
[02:48:34.196 --> 02:48:35.397]  So here she is on Skid Row.
[02:48:37.239 --> 02:48:41.503]  Let me tell you, the camera cannot pick up how disgusting Skid Row is and how out of control it is.
[02:48:41.904 --> 02:48:46.649]  And the drug dealers openly flipping the cops off 150 yards from the police station.
[02:48:47.810 --> 02:48:48.491]  That's where it's at.
[02:48:48.831 --> 02:48:50.273]  And now we're getting Skid Rows in Austin.
[02:48:50.913 --> 02:48:54.937]  They're legal anywhere and everywhere, including your front yard, but not at city council.
[02:48:55.899 --> 02:48:59.221]  Just like the EU exempts its own bureaucrats from EU taxes.
[02:48:59.701 --> 02:49:01.943]  Yes, you can't make that up.
[02:49:02.463 --> 02:49:04.164]  These people are incredible.
[02:49:04.785 --> 02:49:05.685]  So here's Maxine Waters.
[02:49:06.966 --> 02:49:12.389]  Okay, I'm Maxine Waters, and I'm here, and I'm with Stephanie Arnold-Williams.
[02:49:12.409 --> 02:49:14.471]  With Stephanie Arnold-Williams.
[02:49:14.631 --> 02:49:15.711]  And she's so creative.
[02:49:15.772 --> 02:49:17.613]  She set up a really nice environment here.
[02:49:17.853 --> 02:49:20.615]  But she's got all these educational books, and guess what?
[02:49:20.775 --> 02:49:23.016]  I just bought the book on Langston Hughes for $10.
[02:49:23.096 --> 02:49:23.917]  I need change.
[02:49:25.299 --> 02:49:25.579]  I need 10!
[02:49:25.619 --> 02:49:28.503]  By the way, I need a lot more than $10.
[02:49:28.583 --> 02:49:29.964]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:49:29.984 --> 02:49:32.627]  I'm gonna explain this.
[02:49:33.448 --> 02:49:35.630]  I can run this place for a year.
[02:49:37.472 --> 02:49:38.533]  But that's a year.
[02:49:38.694 --> 02:49:42.257]  If I don't order more product, I can run us for a year at our current operations.
[02:49:42.378 --> 02:49:43.299]  And maybe even expand some.
[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:46.122]  But then, in a year,
[02:49:47.092 --> 02:49:50.653]  We'll have to shut this place down and I'll still reach everybody and it'll be big.
[02:49:50.693 --> 02:49:52.713]  It's just that it'll be a crew of 10 people on a crew of 50.
[02:49:53.474 --> 02:50:02.476]  We do a lot of stuff behind the scenes, a lot of stuff you don't know about, a lot of things that, a lot of projects we funded over the years and I really can't even do that anymore.
[02:50:02.516 --> 02:50:04.356]  But we can see our projects doing very well.
[02:50:04.856 --> 02:50:06.476]  Some projects I funded 100%, some projects I funded 30%, but
[02:50:09.608 --> 02:50:10.269]  We've done a lot.
[02:50:10.650 --> 02:50:18.022]  And I wish back in the day, before they'd cut us off so many places, taken all our sponsors away with all the harassment, that I'd made more money and sorted it up.
[02:50:18.102 --> 02:50:18.383]  I didn't.
[02:50:20.585 --> 02:50:23.526]  And so, again, we've got David Knight in the morning doing a great job.
[02:50:23.546 --> 02:50:25.547]  You've got my broadcast you're watching and listening to.
[02:50:25.567 --> 02:50:26.687]  You've got The War Room.
[02:50:26.707 --> 02:50:28.507]  We've got a couple new shows starting in September.
[02:50:28.527 --> 02:50:29.808]  I'm not going to announce those yet.
[02:50:30.528 --> 02:50:31.928]  But there it all is.
[02:50:32.529 --> 02:50:34.669]  And word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[02:50:36.010 --> 02:50:38.110]  They're all admitting that the water's full of deadly poisons.
[02:50:38.270 --> 02:50:40.391]  Not just the glyphosate, but the fluoride, lowering IQ, all of it.
[02:50:40.791 --> 02:50:42.432]  People are suddenly ordering more filters from us.
[02:50:42.732 --> 02:50:42.932]  Yeah.
[02:50:43.712 --> 02:50:44.533]  So it's a win-win.
[02:50:45.174 --> 02:50:48.177]  And we also have a new film that I'm in, a lot of other folks are in.
[02:50:48.777 --> 02:50:49.919]  It's You Can't Watch This.
[02:50:50.459 --> 02:50:52.081]  It's won a whole bunch of big film awards.
[02:50:52.181 --> 02:50:57.246]  And of course, it's good to have this in your library, because nowadays, they're taking everything offline.
[02:50:57.266 --> 02:50:58.347]  So it's good to have original books.
[02:50:58.367 --> 02:50:59.288]  It's good to have DVDs.
[02:51:00.169 --> 02:51:02.432]  It's good to have things that you can copy and share with others.
[02:51:02.992 --> 02:51:04.314]  So, You Can't Watch This.
[02:51:04.934 --> 02:51:05.835]  Very powerful film.
[02:51:06.917 --> 02:51:07.758]  One major awards.
[02:51:08.599 --> 02:51:13.925]  Alex Jones, Gavin McGinnis, Paul Joseph Watson, Tommy Robinson, and Laura Loomer.
[02:51:15.487 --> 02:51:16.127]  Look at those names.
[02:51:16.268 --> 02:51:17.349]  Laura Loomer's totally banned.
[02:51:17.369 --> 02:51:18.510]  Tommy Robinson's banned everywhere.
[02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:21.173]  He's in jail for free speech exposing pedophile rings.
[02:51:21.554 --> 02:51:23.135]  Paul Joseph Watson's a hunted man.
[02:51:23.496 --> 02:51:24.777]  Gavin McGinnis, all the stuff there.
[02:51:26.584 --> 02:51:28.984]  That's where we've gotten here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:29.445 --> 02:51:31.465]  I like my belly hanging out.
[02:51:31.485 --> 02:51:33.505]  I've lost 10 pounds since then, but it doesn't matter.
[02:51:33.725 --> 02:51:36.846]  It's a good film, and people should get it and donate it to local libraries.
[02:51:38.046 --> 02:51:39.046]  That way you reach more folks.
[02:51:39.167 --> 02:51:48.308]  You can go right alongside the pedophile books at the local library teaching six-year-olds how much it is fun to meet men at parks and be driven off in vans.
[02:51:48.788 --> 02:51:49.269]  I'm not kidding.
[02:51:49.409 --> 02:51:50.249]  We covered that yesterday.
[02:51:51.889 --> 02:51:53.150]  The bottom's broken out, folks.
[02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:54.812]  Hell is here, but we are here to counter it.
[02:51:55.172 --> 02:51:59.035]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[02:51:59.616 --> 02:52:01.077]  Okay, who was I talking to?
[02:52:01.457 --> 02:52:02.578]  Jefferson in Virginia.
[02:52:03.399 --> 02:52:04.220]  Go ahead and make your points.
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:04.740]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:06.782 --> 02:52:07.403]  Thanks again, Alex.
[02:52:07.603 --> 02:52:11.706]  On the funding front, I'm pretty sure you can turn the script around on Obama and the leftists here.
[02:52:11.726 --> 02:52:14.729]  He set up the countering disinformation and propaganda
[02:52:15.353 --> 02:52:20.438]  You know, that's a good idea, but you know, the center was created to counter me, so I don't know if the directors of that are going to go along with that.
[02:52:39.386 --> 02:52:43.487]  Well, the president is not the king of the country, but he is the king of the executive branch.
[02:52:43.807 --> 02:52:46.647]  And he can direct them to do what he wants them to do in the executive branch.
[02:52:47.968 --> 02:52:52.349]  By the way, Jefferson, get his name and number for the weekend show I'm going to start doing.
[02:52:52.369 --> 02:52:54.229]  I'm going to start doing it.
[02:52:54.329 --> 02:52:55.489]  And other weekends, it'll be other hosts.
[02:52:55.509 --> 02:52:58.630]  But where we have guest callers on that co-host together.
[02:52:58.650 --> 02:53:00.030]  I think you should be one of those guys, Jefferson.
[02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:01.170]  You've got a great voice.
[02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:02.591]  I can tell you're pretty smart.
[02:53:02.951 --> 02:53:03.851]  What line of work are you in?
[02:53:05.131 --> 02:53:05.851]  I'd rather not say.
[02:53:06.091 --> 02:53:09.092]  But your caller yesterday, Stuart, was a great caller.
[02:53:09.705 --> 02:53:11.666]  Your discussion with him was fantastic.
[02:53:12.206 --> 02:53:17.009]  And you touched on another solution, which was the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[02:53:17.449 --> 02:53:20.190]  Stuart didn't want to talk about it, but you should speak about it more often.
[02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:25.753]  There's $80 trillion sitting around in those funds that they're hiding from us in the second set of books.
[02:53:26.113 --> 02:53:27.534]  And you know about it, and I know about it.
[02:53:29.074 --> 02:53:29.815]  And that's a subject.
[02:53:29.835 --> 02:53:36.398]  You know, we need to revisit all those subjects that I covered hundreds of times, but then I kind of drop it like a dog finally drops a, you know,
[02:53:37.662 --> 02:53:39.343]  A dead squirrel it's got in its mouth.
[02:53:39.363 --> 02:53:43.165]  But all those old subjects that are so critical, I think we should go back and cover again.
[02:53:43.205 --> 02:53:43.665]  What do you think?
[02:53:45.266 --> 02:53:51.110]  Yeah, I think if we want to expand our audience, we have to go back to the basics of what we made ourselves into here.
[02:53:51.130 --> 02:53:52.831]  You know, they call us propagandists.
[02:53:52.851 --> 02:53:54.492]  They call us disinformation people.
[02:53:54.532 --> 02:53:57.813]  But what we are trying to do is make people aware of what the big scam is.
[02:53:58.394 --> 02:53:59.514]  And it's clearly going on.
[02:54:00.275 --> 02:54:05.918]  And if we want more people to tune in to what we're saying, we've got to go build on the foundation.
[02:54:06.718 --> 02:54:07.058]  I hear you.
[02:54:07.098 --> 02:54:11.581]  Well, hey, if you want to be part of that show, I've told my crew we've got to start it within the next two weeks.
[02:54:12.002 --> 02:54:12.902]  I keep saying I'm going to do it.
[02:54:12.962 --> 02:54:14.463]  I still come in every weekend and do shows.
[02:54:14.844 --> 02:54:17.385]  So we're intending to launch Saturdays, I think.
[02:54:18.026 --> 02:54:19.907]  I think the best time would probably be in the afternoon.
[02:54:19.927 --> 02:54:24.650]  And that way, people that want to go out at night can still go out at night, but we can do it live and then archive it.
[02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:29.313]  People to watch Saturday night and just have a roundtable discussion each week with like five or six callers.
[02:54:29.673 --> 02:54:32.555]  Maybe have a group of 20 people we have that we rotate through.
[02:54:32.635 --> 02:54:34.296]  And I just think it'll be something really, really exciting.
[02:54:34.977 --> 02:54:35.878]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:54:35.918 --> 02:54:36.398]  God bless you.
[02:54:38.039 --> 02:54:38.839]  Hey, I live here in Austin.
[02:54:38.859 --> 02:54:39.279]  I've called before.
[02:54:39.299 --> 02:54:41.541]  I used to work in music and rock and roll and all that.
[02:54:41.561 --> 02:54:42.381]  I wanted to say yesterday
[02:55:01.980 --> 02:55:03.942]  I got an InfoWars original for you.
[02:55:04.082 --> 02:55:07.506]  We want to use a music analogy for the current political situation.
[02:55:07.566 --> 02:55:18.538]  It also gets into what you were talking about today with the chemicals and the additives and everything that these clown world Democrats, you know, you hosted the show, we know what it is.
[02:55:19.039 --> 02:55:21.842]  They're like the goofball pop stars on American Idol.
[02:55:22.244 --> 02:55:27.849]  He's begging for Simon Cowell's approval, while Trump is the greatest punk rocker of all time.
[02:55:27.889 --> 02:55:31.812]  You know, recording his own records, booking his own tours, playing what the people want.
[02:55:32.193 --> 02:55:33.874]  He exists outside the system.
[02:55:33.894 --> 02:55:36.236]  He's the president, but he's not the man, right?
[02:55:36.256 --> 02:55:44.303]  You can also use the Elvis and Led Zeppelin analogy, because anybody that knows rock history, they wrote their own book, they called the shots.
[02:55:44.343 --> 02:55:46.125]  And pretty much nobody else ever did.
[02:55:46.185 --> 02:55:48.187]  Even the Beatles couldn't really call their own shots.
[02:55:48.854 --> 02:55:49.574]  Nope.
[02:55:49.734 --> 02:55:50.975]  Very few of them do.
[02:55:51.395 --> 02:55:55.557]  And even if they have the ability to, there's other factors in play.
[02:55:56.037 --> 02:56:01.840]  And so when you had all the stuff on the desk today, you know, all the different mouthwashes and all that, it's the same thing.
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:06.422]  You don't have to get Crest and Colgate just because it's on the shelf in the store.
[02:56:06.702 --> 02:56:07.982]  There are other options.
[02:56:09.243 --> 02:56:11.464]  But you've got to seek those options out.
[02:56:12.264 --> 02:56:13.084]  Absolutely.
[02:56:15.006 --> 02:56:16.066]  Don't go with the flow.
[02:56:16.106 --> 02:56:19.368]  No matter what you do, where you are, don't go with the flow.
[02:56:20.008 --> 02:56:24.450]  You made a comment earlier about why do these people think the gay thing is so great.
[02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:26.331]  There was an old Chris Rock joke.
[02:56:26.391 --> 02:56:31.953]  If everyone had a gay cousin and he was gay before he knew who gay was, you were playing basketball and he was skipping rope.
[02:56:32.453 --> 02:56:34.854]  If it's a natural thing, God bless you.
[02:56:35.094 --> 02:56:41.837]  But all these people that, oh, it's so liberal, it's so enlightened, they do this as a substitute for a personality.
[02:56:42.199 --> 02:56:45.481]  They can't stand on their own two feet, so they do that identity politics crap.
[02:56:45.501 --> 02:56:46.001]  Well, that's it.
[02:56:46.041 --> 02:56:46.661]  Plus, exactly.
[02:56:46.681 --> 02:56:53.025]  They've added a leftist, globalist position on the identity of being gay, so of course they want you to now be gay.
[02:56:53.045 --> 02:56:56.067]  And really, it's about not having children depopulating.
[02:56:56.327 --> 02:56:58.588]  If people don't want to have kids, that's their issue.
[02:56:58.608 --> 02:56:59.569]  I'm not saying they're bad.
[02:57:00.029 --> 02:57:02.530]  That's a total issue of whatever.
[02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:03.431]  Some people can't have kids.
[02:57:04.852 --> 02:57:15.478]  And to act like the country that's been the most open and liberal towards everybody is the bad country, when America's led the way in empowering people, they're using our strength against us.
[02:57:15.838 --> 02:57:17.339]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:25.604]  But I'm telling you, the LGBT community now is pedophilic, it's evil, and I will oppose it.
[02:57:26.624 --> 02:57:27.844]  I will absolutely oppose it.
[02:57:27.904 --> 02:57:31.526]  I mean, I oppose Jeffrey Epstein trying to have sex with 10-year-old girls.
[02:57:31.726 --> 02:57:32.746]  Believe me, they got younger than that.
[02:57:33.306 --> 02:57:37.508]  And I oppose, you know, some pervert homosexual who wants to have sex with a little boy.
[02:57:37.808 --> 02:57:39.428]  It's disgusting, and it's evil.
[02:57:39.488 --> 02:57:41.889]  Keep your damn hands off the kids.
[02:57:42.969 --> 02:57:44.890]  Or we're gonna hang you from the neck till dead.
[02:57:46.651 --> 02:57:47.771]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:48.411 --> 02:57:50.672]  Hour number four, your calls, Mike Adams and more.
[02:57:52.588 --> 02:58:05.476]  Thomas Jefferson predicted, over 240 years ago, that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:58:05.716 --> 02:58:08.238]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:58:08.638 --> 02:58:14.042]  farming goods a week ago, and we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[02:58:14.682 --> 02:58:18.605]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:58:19.226 --> 02:58:19.806]  That's beautiful.
[02:58:20.267 --> 02:58:21.828]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:58:22.168 --> 02:58:23.189]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:58:23.789 --> 02:58:31.135]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:58:31.375 --> 02:58:33.337]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:58:33.697 --> 02:58:37.580]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:58:37.741 --> 02:58:38.801]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:58:39.602 --> 02:58:43.390]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:58:43.711 --> 02:58:44.572]  We are the resistance.
[02:58:44.813 --> 02:58:45.454]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[02:58:52.654 --> 02:59:03.420]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[02:59:03.881 --> 02:59:07.503]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[02:59:08.003 --> 02:59:17.369]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[02:59:18.109 --> 02:59:19.609]  The system is vulnerable.
[02:59:20.129 --> 02:59:22.310]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[02:59:22.810 --> 02:59:25.890]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[02:59:26.451 --> 02:59:32.812]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[02:59:33.352 --> 02:59:38.713]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[02:59:39.313 --> 02:59:43.794]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity Water Filter today.
[02:59:44.514 --> 02:59:51.917]  Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:55.058 --> 03:00:00.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.857 --> 03:00:18.017]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:18.497 --> 03:00:20.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.938 --> 03:00:27.920]  Alright, we're into hour number four and I mainly hit on fluoride.
[03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:31.741]  Now they admit it's causing massive IQ reductions and cancer.
[03:00:32.202 --> 03:00:33.082]  It's insane!
[03:00:34.679 --> 03:00:36.140]  It's insane, and they know it.
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:44.263]  And it's not like Prop 65 where they say, you know, a one-billionth piece of lead kills you, and it's a fraud.
[03:00:45.023 --> 03:00:54.066]  It's the left saying, fluoridate, fluoridate at super high toxic levels that they know hurts you, and then going, oh, but a factory is putting out carbon dioxide.
[03:00:54.106 --> 03:00:54.827]  It's deadly.
[03:00:55.247 --> 03:00:56.087]  Plants breathe it.
[03:00:57.367 --> 03:00:58.848]  They claim they're the environmentalists.
[03:00:59.188 --> 03:01:00.709]  They claim they're the guardians of humans.
[03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:03.750]  But the left can't talk about how they want to kill everybody.
[03:01:05.265 --> 03:01:07.967]  Well, these callers have been super awesome.
[03:01:08.587 --> 03:01:10.908]  They're always great, but man, these are some great calls.
[03:01:11.329 --> 03:01:13.650]  Chris, Dennis, Chris, David, Chris, Joseph.
[03:01:14.050 --> 03:01:15.992]  We'll get to all of you, then Mike Adams is taking over.
[03:01:16.352 --> 03:01:18.633]  Got a few more clips I'm going to play next segment I haven't gotten to yet.
[03:01:20.294 --> 03:01:23.276]  Well, we'll play them next segment, but right now, who's been holding longest now?
[03:01:23.816 --> 03:01:24.957]  Chris in Illinois.
[03:01:24.977 --> 03:01:25.837]  Then we'll go to David and others.
[03:01:25.857 --> 03:01:26.298]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:01:28.024 --> 03:01:28.905]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:29.305 --> 03:01:39.673]  You know, I've been selling water filtration here in Chicago for about 12 years, and I recently have seen more calls for RO filtration, which actually removes the fluoride.
[03:01:39.713 --> 03:01:44.897]  We offer something that actually puts the minerals back in after filtration, so that's good news.
[03:01:46.781 --> 03:01:51.744]  And then one other point real quick about the... Well, let me just stop you because people ask me what's the best water filtration.
[03:01:51.764 --> 03:01:52.444]  This is important.
[03:01:52.945 --> 03:01:55.286]  The best thing is reverse osmosis.
[03:01:55.326 --> 03:01:57.507]  Cuts out 100%, as you know, if it's set up properly.
[03:01:57.907 --> 03:01:58.868]  Very inexpensive.
[03:01:59.348 --> 03:02:00.429]  And that's what I use for cooking.
[03:02:00.489 --> 03:02:02.310]  But you better add the minerals back in.
[03:02:02.350 --> 03:02:02.990]  That's critical.
[03:02:03.291 --> 03:02:08.293]  Because if you drink only distilled water or only reverse osmosis, you get some major problems from that, right?
[03:02:09.594 --> 03:02:09.914]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:09.954 --> 03:02:10.455]  That's a fact.
[03:02:11.454 --> 03:02:14.897]  We actually do a post-treatment that puts like 20 minerals back in.
[03:02:15.097 --> 03:02:21.283]  And that's the good news is you're only getting the good minerals because most minerals that are already in the water raw are bound to other chemicals and toxins.
[03:02:21.623 --> 03:02:23.565]  So that's why it's critical to just take everything out.
[03:02:24.586 --> 03:02:24.906]  Correct.
[03:02:24.966 --> 03:02:28.109]  And you know, the thing is that we get a lot of calls into the office.
[03:02:28.129 --> 03:02:29.551]  People want RO.
[03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:30.992]  They're becoming more educated.
[03:02:31.773 --> 03:02:35.196]  Oh, I mean, today I've had three conversations with people that
[03:02:35.891 --> 03:02:38.252]  That have said, I want the fluoride out of the water, essentially.
[03:02:38.352 --> 03:02:43.793]  Yeah, well RO's the best way to go, except, or still, if you add good minerals back, it just better be the right thing.
[03:02:44.173 --> 03:02:51.355]  That's why I just go with Gravity Feds, because they cut out all the toxic chemicals, leave some of the minerals, and so if people don't know what they're doing, it's the best system.
[03:02:51.395 --> 03:02:53.936]  I literally, morally think about the best systems.
[03:02:54.256 --> 03:03:00.818]  We also sell reverse osmosis, we've just got to notice about it, because, of course, you explain to people though, you better add the minerals back.
[03:03:02.199 --> 03:03:03.399]  That is correct, yes.
[03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:08.101]  Because RO... I mean, it strips it down to hydrogen and oxygen, the two elements of water.
[03:03:08.521 --> 03:03:10.262]  Oh, you want absolutely pure water.
[03:03:10.382 --> 03:03:11.723]  It's reverse osmosis.
[03:03:11.903 --> 03:03:12.823]  That's my own research.
[03:03:12.843 --> 03:03:15.144]  But I'm sorry to keep interrupting.
[03:03:15.164 --> 03:03:15.784]  What's your main point?
[03:03:16.485 --> 03:03:19.626]  Well, so, you know, The Hunt, that movie, The Hunt.
[03:03:19.766 --> 03:03:21.407]  I don't know if you've covered this.
[03:03:21.487 --> 03:03:21.907]  I'm sorry.
[03:03:21.967 --> 03:03:23.087]  I haven't been able to listen a lot.
[03:03:23.107 --> 03:03:28.970]  But, you know, Dick Cheney was in Kathy O'Brien's book about how he... The Most Dangerous Game.
[03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.950]  The Most Dangerous Game.
[03:03:31.013 --> 03:03:57.377]  And so I've been calling Liz Cheney's office and asking them about it, and they don't really like me calling and asking them, but I mean, you know, it's not that, you know, I just don't understand why these things are occurring, but it still seems out of the realm of possibility for people, and it's actually happened already with a vice president of ours, you know, hunting people.
[03:03:58.891 --> 03:04:01.693]  And you know, a lot of folks don't understand that hunting people's been done.
[03:04:01.913 --> 03:04:02.653]  The Romans did it.
[03:04:02.733 --> 03:04:03.654]  The Babylonians did it.
[03:04:03.674 --> 03:04:07.476]  Uh, hunting, uh, folks is a very old deal.
[03:04:08.296 --> 03:04:12.939]  And it goes back to sometimes you'd let prisoners go or gladiators go and then run them through swamps and things.
[03:04:13.679 --> 03:04:15.200]  And so, truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:15.720]  Great points.
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:16.180]  Anything else?
[03:04:17.521 --> 03:04:18.021]  That's it.
[03:04:18.122 --> 03:04:18.802]  Keep it up, man.
[03:04:18.862 --> 03:04:19.422]  Love you guys.
[03:04:20.063 --> 03:04:20.703]  Love you too, brother.
[03:04:22.104 --> 03:04:23.845]  Yeah, you know, that piece that, uh,
[03:04:24.750 --> 03:04:27.631]  Greg Reese put together was powerful, but I encouraged him.
[03:04:27.651 --> 03:04:36.053]  I said, go back and do a bigger one with Ewing Cameron, who actually, Dr. Ewing Cameron, who actually ran the MKUltra program.
[03:04:36.953 --> 03:04:48.116]  And it was declassified in 77 that he had kidnapped more than 10,000 children and taken them mainly to Canada and also New York.
[03:04:49.352 --> 03:04:51.593]  And turned them into robots.
[03:04:51.753 --> 03:04:53.434]  I mean, they were totally programmed.
[03:04:54.474 --> 03:04:58.055]  And that was in the 60s and 70s he did that.
[03:04:58.216 --> 03:04:58.896]  That's what they do.
[03:04:58.956 --> 03:04:59.876]  This is really real, folks.
[03:05:05.098 --> 03:05:08.760]  Well, today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:14.342]  I just devoured your cousin, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[03:05:35.885 --> 03:05:39.986]  What's going on here?
[03:06:15.412 --> 03:06:17.393]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in hour number four.
[03:06:17.533 --> 03:06:20.135]  Coming in, Mike Adams, The Health Ranger, NaturalNews.com.
[03:06:20.175 --> 03:06:22.176]  More of your calls here in a moment.
[03:06:22.196 --> 03:06:23.137]  I have two clips I want to play.
[03:06:24.827 --> 03:06:29.290]  One of these, I had the idea today when I was talking about fluorides like a weapon targeting children.
[03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:31.891]  They admitted it, and I showed the documents and all the new studies.
[03:06:32.291 --> 03:06:34.793]  And this big awakening, people are like, oh my god, you're right, incredible!
[03:06:35.053 --> 03:06:36.374]  How has what you said come true again?
[03:06:37.294 --> 03:06:46.520]  I showed people seven or eight other big Harvard studies, Mexican national government studies, Chinese studies, German studies, saying the exact same thing.
[03:06:46.540 --> 03:06:48.100]  I mean, these studies are done well.
[03:06:49.621 --> 03:06:54.024]  Kids just drinking fluoride a year lowers it about a point a year.
[03:06:55.572 --> 03:06:55.972]  Wow.
[03:06:57.273 --> 03:06:57.694]  Wow.
[03:06:58.834 --> 03:06:59.215]  Wow.
[03:06:59.995 --> 03:07:01.316]  And that's just what's in the water.
[03:07:02.137 --> 03:07:03.418]  It's much stronger in toothpaste.
[03:07:05.439 --> 03:07:11.964]  But, uh, I said it's much like Darth Vader, like, you know, shooting and targeting, uh, the, uh, kids or, or, you know, you know, predator.
[03:07:11.984 --> 03:07:18.169]  I mean, this is a weapon system, like on a box of shells for hunting varmints.
[03:07:18.209 --> 03:07:19.670]  If it's for coyotes, it shows a coyote.
[03:07:20.270 --> 03:07:22.652]  If it's for prairie dogs, it shows a prairie dog.
[03:07:23.755 --> 03:07:26.277]  If it's for white-tailed deer, it shows a white-tailed deer.
[03:07:26.297 --> 03:07:27.918]  If it's for a moose, it shows a moose.
[03:07:27.958 --> 03:07:34.402]  Well, on the fluoride box of the fluoride water is a baby, because that's the target.
[03:07:34.442 --> 03:07:35.303]  It's a baby's brain.
[03:07:35.563 --> 03:07:36.404]  So here's that quick clip.
[03:07:37.885 --> 03:07:45.910]  If you took your six-month-old baby and dropped it on its head on purpose, you would lose that child if you were seen doing it.
[03:07:46.511 --> 03:07:46.991]  And you should.
[03:07:48.212 --> 03:07:52.735]  If you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there, why there's mental illness everywhere, why people seem
[03:07:54.202 --> 03:08:17.394]  So incredibly stupid, it's because the Soviets, the Communists, the proto-globalists that took over, had work camps, and they put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the gulags.
[03:08:18.455 --> 03:08:22.116]  I went to HEB this morning, the crew did, walked right in, it says,
[03:08:24.775 --> 03:08:27.296]  Baby fluoride water.
[03:08:28.937 --> 03:08:30.098]  Let's zoom right in on that.
[03:08:30.438 --> 03:08:31.879]  And notice it shows you the target.
[03:08:32.059 --> 03:08:40.984]  It's kind of like buying a box of 30-odd-6 rifle shells, rifle rounds, and on the cover is a deer.
[03:08:41.004 --> 03:08:43.966]  And there's a little crosshair on the side of the deer.
[03:08:59.286 --> 03:09:00.366]  Maximum firepower!
[03:09:05.427 --> 03:09:07.808]  Oh, I mean... Oh, baby!
[03:09:08.208 --> 03:09:10.248]  It's time to kill brain cells!
[03:09:12.209 --> 03:09:14.749]  So much more fun to take our time.
[03:09:15.409 --> 03:09:19.470]  And then it's bye-bye brain, and you've got a good automaton.
[03:09:22.771 --> 03:09:22.951]  Wow.
[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:27.581]  That's scary as hell, because it's all real, folks.
[03:09:28.301 --> 03:09:35.843]  But there's the cognitive dissonance that the White House science czar wrote this huge book about putting fluoride in the water to brain damage you 45 years ago.
[03:09:36.623 --> 03:09:38.423]  It was published the year I was born, EcoScience.
[03:09:39.503 --> 03:09:42.764]  And it's like, well, oh, 5G, they admit, is way worse than kill us.
[03:09:42.904 --> 03:09:43.264]  OK.
[03:09:43.284 --> 03:09:44.405]  Bye-bye.
[03:09:44.425 --> 03:09:45.285]  I die.
[03:09:45.305 --> 03:09:50.086]  There'll all be these marathons that raise money for everybody getting brain tumors.
[03:09:51.243 --> 03:09:58.329]  Instead of just stopping it, not letting these people do it, but until we admit they're a bunch of eugenicist devil worshippers, it's only going to get worse.
[03:09:59.750 --> 03:10:03.973]  Yes, a gang of psychotics took over our government.
[03:10:05.114 --> 03:10:07.816]  That's why they don't want Trump getting into everything, because they've done so many crimes.
[03:10:11.559 --> 03:10:12.400]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[03:10:14.321 --> 03:10:18.284]  Dennis in Virginia, and then we'll go to David and Chris and everybody else.
[03:10:18.765 --> 03:10:20.246]  Dennis in Virginia, thanks for holding.
[03:10:21.274 --> 03:10:23.495]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on again.
[03:10:23.856 --> 03:10:30.180]  Yeah, I just saw your clip on Maxine Waters, and I tell you, she epitomizes the effects of fluoride toxication.
[03:10:32.381 --> 03:10:37.084]  Yeah, she's sitting with a homeless lady trying to sell books to help the homeless community, and she wants her change back.
[03:10:37.444 --> 03:10:41.447]  She's worth, I think she's worth like $100 million or something herself, and she wanted to give the lady $10.
[03:10:41.507 --> 03:10:44.029]  She's way out there.
[03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:45.570]  She's like, I need change!
[03:10:45.870 --> 03:10:47.371]  I'm not giving her 10 extra dollars!
[03:10:48.550 --> 03:10:52.671]  And these producers of fluoride, I mean, they're making billions of dollars for pumping the poisons, you know.
[03:10:52.911 --> 03:10:53.651]  Oh, I forgot!
[03:10:53.731 --> 03:10:54.571]  We get to pay.
[03:10:54.851 --> 03:10:55.271]  I've seen that.
[03:10:55.511 --> 03:10:58.432]  I think Austin pays $3 million a year for the poison.
[03:11:00.272 --> 03:11:00.872]  It's crazy.
[03:11:01.133 --> 03:11:07.654]  You know, and it's all the things you've said, and, you know, I asked a lot of friends of mine, I said, would you brush your teeth with arsenic?
[03:11:07.714 --> 03:11:08.434]  And they said, well, no.
[03:11:08.994 --> 03:11:12.235]  I said, well, fluoride is only slightly less toxic than arsenic.
[03:11:12.775 --> 03:11:13.955]  So why would you brush your teeth with it?
[03:11:14.275 --> 03:11:18.216]  You know, and it binds with metals in the brain, causing dementia, Alzheimer's,
[03:11:18.966 --> 03:11:23.787]  And watching your program about fluoride before, you know, how it competes with iodine.
[03:11:23.807 --> 03:11:27.188]  I started using X3 and I got about a month ago.
[03:11:27.208 --> 03:11:33.710]  Now, I'm kind of skeptical on a lot of products out there, but yours, everything I've ever got from you guys, I mean, it's been right on.
[03:11:34.170 --> 03:11:36.610]  And the X3, I mean, I can really tell the difference.
[03:11:36.650 --> 03:11:38.911]  It took probably like 10 days to start kicking in.
[03:11:39.551 --> 03:11:46.393]  But because of what I've learned from fluoride being a halogen and competing with iodine as a thyroid and how it affects the body,
[03:11:47.077 --> 03:11:49.118]  It's like, you know, I said, I'm going to give it a try and it really worked.
[03:11:49.458 --> 03:11:51.179]  And I got your electric pure water filter too.
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:54.401]  Just, you know, just Brother, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[03:11:54.461 --> 03:11:57.243]  But yeah, good, clean iodine is a whole nother world.
[03:11:57.923 --> 03:11:59.164]  And it's just amazing what it does.
[03:11:59.204 --> 03:11:59.664]  God bless you.
[03:11:59.684 --> 03:12:00.345]  I appreciate the call.
[03:12:01.334 --> 03:12:03.416]  Okay, let's go to David in California.
[03:12:03.436 --> 03:12:03.896]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:03.916 --> 03:12:05.057]  You're on the air with another plug.
[03:12:05.097 --> 03:12:07.498]  I appreciate all the plugging, but this all goes together.
[03:12:07.538 --> 03:12:13.683]  Like, the krill oil is what makes the blood-brain barrier stronger, and it's what the brain works off of.
[03:12:13.723 --> 03:12:16.345]  I mean, I get high off these, and I'm not into drugs.
[03:12:16.765 --> 03:12:18.686]  I haven't, you know, I might smoke marijuana once a year.
[03:12:18.706 --> 03:12:20.328]  I haven't done anything since, like, college.
[03:12:20.348 --> 03:12:21.048]  I tried a few things.
[03:12:22.569 --> 03:12:26.492]  I take krill oil and fish oil before I go to bed because I sleep deeper.
[03:12:26.512 --> 03:12:30.396]  I have incredible dreams and the studies are there.
[03:12:30.976 --> 03:12:31.937]  Go ahead, David.
[03:12:31.957 --> 03:12:32.517]  Thanks for calling.
[03:12:33.879 --> 03:12:39.403]  I just wanted to plug the honor roll real quick.
[03:12:39.943 --> 03:12:47.430]  My son just started school a few weeks ago and the first week was kind of rough for him and got him going on the honor roll about the end of that week.
[03:12:47.550 --> 03:12:50.732]  And sure enough, the following week and the weeks after that were just
[03:12:53.082 --> 03:13:00.968]  Well, don't you know the old wives' tale for hundreds of years?
[03:13:01.489 --> 03:13:06.452]  My mother's mother would make her take cod oil every morning before school.
[03:13:07.153 --> 03:13:09.995]  And she'd literally grab her by the nose when she was littler and say, you know, take it.
[03:13:10.435 --> 03:13:11.736]  But that's what you do.
[03:13:11.997 --> 03:13:12.917]  Mothers knew.
[03:13:13.518 --> 03:13:17.381]  Mothers used to put a little bit of cod oil in baby milk once the baby was six months old.
[03:13:18.424 --> 03:13:20.985]  Well, we don't do that anymore, and the IQs are going straight down.
[03:13:21.005 --> 03:13:21.765]  There's an article on that.
[03:13:22.065 --> 03:13:25.746]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:13:25.906 --> 03:13:38.390]  Yeah, not just that, but the Ultimate Fish Oil as well has been helping me out, just putting words together and kind of being able to communicate a lot better, putting ideas and whatnot together.
[03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:43.591]  But mainly, I just wanted to touch on the whole fluoride thing.
[03:13:43.631 --> 03:13:45.932]  I mean, it's kind of, it's just,
[03:13:46.394 --> 03:13:56.459]  It really sad when, you know, you walk into a Walmart and you see rows and rows of this, you know, water that's got added fluoride on it.
[03:13:56.499 --> 03:13:59.141]  And then it's clearly got a picture of a baby on it.
[03:13:59.781 --> 03:14:06.504]  You know, I mean, most people aren't even going to go out and look at the label, see what's actually in it.
[03:14:06.525 --> 03:14:09.286]  They're just going to see water and a baby and say, Oh man, here we go.
[03:14:09.366 --> 03:14:10.667]  This is exactly what I needed.
[03:14:11.307 --> 03:14:13.088]  And I mean, it's just there.
[03:14:13.934 --> 03:14:16.915]  It's sad because it's only making this a lot worse.
[03:14:16.995 --> 03:14:22.077]  I just barely started researching and started looking into this, what fluoride actually does.
[03:14:22.117 --> 03:14:25.758]  And it's all because of you and everything you've put out there.
[03:14:25.998 --> 03:14:27.779]  But brother, it's not because of me.
[03:14:27.819 --> 03:14:29.159]  And I'm not saying this to disagree with you.
[03:14:29.799 --> 03:14:31.300]  Do you understand?
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:34.441]  It is you, the listener, that has spread the word, that already knows all this too.
[03:14:34.761 --> 03:14:35.461]  I'm just covering stuff.
[03:14:35.501 --> 03:14:36.461]  It's all public knowledge.
[03:14:36.742 --> 03:14:37.802]  It's you that carries the ball.
[03:14:37.902 --> 03:14:38.802]  Thanks to you.
[03:14:39.462 --> 03:14:39.903]  God bless you.
[03:14:39.923 --> 03:14:40.763]  I appreciate your call, David.
[03:14:41.587 --> 03:14:43.008]  Oh, he had one more drag queen story.
[03:14:43.028 --> 03:14:43.588]  I wouldn't get to it.
[03:14:43.608 --> 03:14:44.288]  It's not drag queen.
[03:14:44.908 --> 03:14:47.089]  I was reading this article about the drag queen axe murder.
[03:14:47.109 --> 03:14:47.969]  We're going to play that clip.
[03:14:47.989 --> 03:14:49.170]  We'll go to Mike Adams next segment.
[03:14:50.130 --> 03:14:53.051]  And from Australia, and they only gave this dude six years.
[03:14:54.032 --> 03:14:56.693]  He comes in, attacks everybody with axes, hacks their heads in.
[03:14:58.433 --> 03:14:59.454]  People are deformed for life.
[03:14:59.494 --> 03:15:00.074]  They survive.
[03:15:00.094 --> 03:15:04.036]  Attacks a black lady, attacks some white dudes.
[03:15:05.536 --> 03:15:08.917]  And, you know, he walks over to what looks like a trendy gay dude or something.
[03:15:08.957 --> 03:15:10.098]  And the guy's being nice to him.
[03:15:11.857 --> 03:15:16.299]  But you see, this trans man, woman, wanted women.
[03:15:17.179 --> 03:15:18.800]  And a woman turned him down.
[03:15:20.381 --> 03:15:22.761]  And so he went in and attacked people with an axe.
[03:15:22.822 --> 03:15:25.723]  And the left's like, well, people were mean to him.
[03:15:25.743 --> 03:15:29.744]  And a higher court said, no, you're getting 40 years.
[03:15:29.764 --> 03:15:34.026]  You're not getting six years for walking in and attacking people with an axe.
[03:15:34.046 --> 03:15:38.268]  So we're going to play that footage coming up next segment.
[03:15:38.308 --> 03:15:39.748]  Go to Mike Adams and a few more of your calls.
[03:15:41.903 --> 03:15:45.427]  They're just worshipping someone that becomes trans because it's going to be brain chips.
[03:15:45.467 --> 03:15:47.189]  It's going to be, they're going to have clones.
[03:15:47.369 --> 03:15:54.477]  They're already born walking around and the big crime will be saying, hey, I don't want your corporate produced clones that work for you telling me what to do.
[03:15:54.597 --> 03:15:55.158]  I'm a human.
[03:15:55.178 --> 03:15:59.483]  They're going to say, that's a restable offense because anything trans is super cool.
[03:16:02.555 --> 03:16:07.458]  President Trump has reacted to Epstein's death in what is sadly a very unsurprising way.
[03:16:07.918 --> 03:16:09.699]  He is spreading a conspiracy theory.
[03:16:09.779 --> 03:16:16.043]  Tying the death of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in prison to the president's former political rivals, the Clintons.
[03:16:16.223 --> 03:16:21.146]  The president retweeting a theory without evidence that implicates the Clintons in Epstein's death.
[03:16:21.426 --> 03:16:22.227]  Let that sink in.
[03:16:23.154 --> 03:16:28.176]  This would be like Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan claiming that LBJ had Kennedy killed.
[03:16:28.416 --> 03:16:34.998]  Now, the president is helping to spread an outrageous false story about Epstein's death being tied to the Clintons.
[03:16:35.238 --> 03:16:42.421]  Shortly after Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, President Trump retweeted this video from a conservative commentator.
[03:16:43.052 --> 03:16:48.075]  For some odd reason, people that have information on the Clintons end up dead.
[03:16:48.616 --> 03:16:50.517]  And they usually die from suicide.
[03:16:50.597 --> 03:16:51.618]  It's appalling.
[03:16:51.918 --> 03:16:55.140]  I mean, there's no other way to put it.
[03:16:55.180 --> 03:17:03.866]  You have the President of the United States retweeting an unfounded conspiracy theory with no evidence to back it up.
[03:17:04.526 --> 03:17:06.927]  About a former president of the United States.
[03:17:06.947 --> 03:17:12.250]  We have a president now whose Twitter feed is a chief source of disinformation.
[03:17:12.290 --> 03:17:23.395]  This is another example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories.
[03:17:23.635 --> 03:17:26.037]  Some extraordinary conspiracy theories.
[03:17:26.097 --> 03:17:27.858]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:17:27.898 --> 03:17:28.979]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:17:28.999 --> 03:17:30.340]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:31.421]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:17:31.481 --> 03:17:32.642]  Conspiracy theories.
[03:17:32.762 --> 03:17:37.786]  Untrustworthy and ridiculous, baseless conspiracy theories.
[03:17:37.826 --> 03:17:45.852]  The President of the United States is pushing a dangerous and completely unfounded murder conspiracy theory about his predecessor.
[03:17:45.912 --> 03:17:46.973]  But do you think it's dangerous?
[03:17:47.073 --> 03:17:48.394]  What he's doing is dangerous.
[03:17:48.534 --> 03:17:51.255]  Republican Marco Rubio agrees it's dangerous.
[03:17:51.335 --> 03:17:52.135]  It's dangerous.
[03:17:52.175 --> 03:17:53.555]  Change is my middle name.
[03:17:53.615 --> 03:17:57.257]  Dangerously claiming that Epstein was murdered by the Clintons?
[03:17:57.437 --> 03:18:01.959]  But there is no evidence at all to support the conspiracy theory the president is fueling.
[03:18:01.979 --> 03:18:09.161]  Marco Rubio says there is evidence Russian bots are now pushing this new conspiracy theory online to further divide Americans.
[03:18:09.402 --> 03:18:15.684]  All three of us, if we tweeted stuff like this in this reckless fashion, we would likely lose our jobs.
[03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:49.567]  The Animated Contest of Liberty is waiting for you.
[03:18:50.907 --> 03:18:52.948]  But you've got to take it in your hands.
[03:18:53.228 --> 03:18:54.769]  You've got to have the will.
[03:18:57.199 --> 03:19:00.661]  Accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[03:19:01.921 --> 03:19:02.442]  Do that!
[03:19:04.603 --> 03:19:06.243]  And you'll earn your way to the next level.
[03:19:07.884 --> 03:19:09.185]  This is the Info War.
[03:19:12.261 --> 03:19:17.287]  I just believe that they can obtain something if they can destroy the planet before we go to launch fish.
[03:19:17.447 --> 03:19:23.475]  They are just an intergalactic demonic transmission spewed out of hell trying to bring the planet down before the next level.
[03:19:23.515 --> 03:19:25.858]  But we will make the jump and nothing's going to stop them.
[03:19:25.938 --> 03:19:28.120]  And we're going to have a pro-human future.
[03:19:28.220 --> 03:19:29.342]  We're not just going interstellar.
[03:19:29.462 --> 03:19:30.403]  We're going interdimensional.
[03:19:30.583 --> 03:19:34.406]  As we travel up this true stairway to heaven, people won't want to play video games anymore.
[03:19:34.506 --> 03:19:37.188]  They'll realize this is the real universe with the real levels.
[03:19:37.389 --> 03:19:39.130]  This is where you want to get that score.
[03:19:39.270 --> 03:19:41.692]  Not in Super Mario Brother, not in Donkey Kong.
[03:19:41.852 --> 03:19:47.997]  I'm Alex Jones, transmitting from the third dimension, planet Earth, two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm, Milky Way Galaxy.
[03:20:06.061 --> 03:20:08.669]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.187 --> 03:20:22.928]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.308 --> 03:20:25.810]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:21:03.203 --> 03:21:04.263]  So I married an axe murderer.
[03:21:04.283 --> 03:21:13.027]  We make jokes about this, but in Australia, a man, you read the court filings, like this woman attacked people randomly with axes, but it's a man.
[03:21:15.668 --> 03:21:22.151]  And we're all supposed to play along with this mental illness, so this man was only given six years for to tag people for no reason, start rolling the video, please.
[03:21:23.366 --> 03:21:29.788]  And for TV viewers, and the higher court said, no, you're going to get more time because the left had said, well, this person is a victim.
[03:21:29.848 --> 03:21:35.630]  He's allowed to go around as a protected class and just randomly come into stores and try to menace people.
[03:21:36.571 --> 03:21:39.392]  And then nobody was scared because they're all trendies.
[03:21:40.052 --> 03:21:40.872]  They were just normal.
[03:21:41.952 --> 03:21:43.653]  And so starts hacking him in the face.
[03:21:43.673 --> 03:21:48.655]  And we'll go to the article as we show this video and show the folks in
[03:21:50.017 --> 03:21:54.481]  The hospital, with the huge hatchet cuts into their eyes and noses and faces.
[03:21:55.281 --> 03:21:56.162]  Like, hey, how's it going?
[03:21:56.202 --> 03:21:56.843]  What's going on?
[03:21:57.964 --> 03:21:58.404]  Oh, really?
[03:21:58.444 --> 03:22:00.205]  A girl that I asked out didn't go out with me.
[03:22:01.026 --> 03:22:02.067]  And so I'm a protected group.
[03:22:03.368 --> 03:22:04.429]  I'm gonna attack you.
[03:22:06.631 --> 03:22:07.211]  And bam!
[03:22:08.052 --> 03:22:08.732]  Axe in the face.
[03:22:08.773 --> 03:22:13.316]  And they actually said in court, this is a trans person, they're allowed to do this, they only need six years.
[03:22:13.877 --> 03:22:14.717]  Well, higher court said,
[03:22:15.683 --> 03:22:16.563]  No, that's wrong.
[03:22:16.583 --> 03:22:17.864]  It was a public interest.
[03:22:17.884 --> 03:22:25.225]  That's very rare where the higher court came down and took over the case and said, this is wrong.
[03:22:25.265 --> 03:22:28.626]  You need to spend the rest of your life in prison.
[03:22:29.746 --> 03:22:32.847]  And again, the clip, boom, full power axe in the head.
[03:22:33.447 --> 03:22:34.667]  Talk about swinging like a boy.
[03:22:34.687 --> 03:22:36.888]  Starts hacking that trendy.
[03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:42.769]  And the left said, you can read the transcript, said, this is allowed.
[03:22:43.450 --> 03:22:44.890]  We're going to have sex with your kids.
[03:22:46.263 --> 03:22:52.691]  We're going to put fluoride in your water, because folks have got to think they're going to get somewhere great if they chemically sterilize.
[03:22:53.672 --> 03:22:55.614]  Doesn't look like that guy chemically sterilized.
[03:22:55.634 --> 03:22:58.117]  Maybe he was injecting some testosterone.
[03:22:59.039 --> 03:23:00.200]  Mike Adams has taken over.
[03:23:00.540 --> 03:23:03.003]  I promise to get all the calls if they took 10 calls.
[03:23:03.831 --> 03:23:04.972]  They put 20-something on the board.
[03:23:05.473 --> 03:23:08.356]  I got to 17 of them, or 16 of them.
[03:23:08.376 --> 03:23:14.122]  But Chris and Chris and Joseph, you have my word that I'll give you double the time tomorrow on the same subject.
[03:23:14.382 --> 03:23:15.884]  If you give us your name and number, I will call you.
[03:23:15.904 --> 03:23:17.145]  But all three of them get a free t-shirt.
[03:23:17.946 --> 03:23:19.087]  So please give us your info.
[03:23:19.107 --> 03:23:20.489]  We'll send that to you.
[03:23:20.509 --> 03:23:21.670]  So, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:23:22.791 --> 03:23:25.214]  By the way, t-shirts, by the way, are about to sell out.
[03:23:26.260 --> 03:23:31.265]  Some of the best-selling ones, like the Space Shuttle 1776 Space Force shirt.
[03:23:31.285 --> 03:23:31.925]  That's a limited edition.
[03:23:31.945 --> 03:23:32.826]  We're not printing more of those.
[03:23:33.106 --> 03:23:34.968]  We'll have a new design coming out that's similar but different.
[03:23:34.988 --> 03:23:38.992]  And then we also have the last of the three designs.
[03:23:39.012 --> 03:23:42.195]  That's another collector's edition of the Betsy Ross flag.
[03:23:42.215 --> 03:23:44.937]  We have that lower third we can put up for folks there so they can see that.
[03:23:45.458 --> 03:23:50.542]  These are great-looking shirts, and they fund our operation.
[03:23:51.400 --> 03:23:58.162]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:23:58.482 --> 03:24:04.403]  And we have this big World Awakens sale that's an extension of the big Mega Sale.
[03:24:04.704 --> 03:24:07.244]  Just some of the items were sold out, and some items are close to selling out.
[03:24:07.264 --> 03:24:11.345]  So instead of all the items being 50% off or more, we have a bunch of them off.
[03:24:11.765 --> 03:24:13.006]  That's going to have to end the new documentary.
[03:24:13.046 --> 03:24:14.286]  You can't watch this, but I'm in.
[03:24:14.326 --> 03:24:14.846]  It's really good.
[03:24:15.126 --> 03:24:18.067]  We've got McGinnis, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Limmer, Tommy Robinson, and others.
[03:24:18.367 --> 03:24:19.327]  It's exclusively available.
[03:24:19.648 --> 03:24:20.568]  We printed up a bunch of DVDs.
[03:24:21.588 --> 03:24:23.470]  Mike, what do you make of the bottom falling out?
[03:24:35.956 --> 03:24:38.918]  You've covered the hundreds of studies, NaturalNews.com like no other.
[03:24:38.938 --> 03:24:40.759]  I think you've been the number one on that.
[03:24:41.099 --> 03:24:45.061]  All the scientists, all the toxicologists, the FDA scientists saying, get fluoride out.
[03:24:45.642 --> 03:24:53.726]  Why suddenly with this new JAMA study, that it's hurting boys more than ever, causing massive IQ reductions, why suddenly are people saying, we're vindicated?
[03:24:53.746 --> 03:24:58.649]  Because I know if I'm getting these calls, you own a big lab that tests this stuff, you're getting more calls than I'm getting.
[03:24:58.709 --> 03:25:00.750]  I mean, are you getting the vindication calls?
[03:25:01.131 --> 03:25:01.691]  And why now?
[03:25:01.711 --> 03:25:03.472]  Because this is just one of hundreds of studies.
[03:25:04.502 --> 03:25:07.726]  That's right, my phone's been blowing up too about the publication of this article.
[03:25:07.746 --> 03:25:13.453]  But look, you know Alex, you are 20 years ahead of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[03:25:13.513 --> 03:25:21.183]  So, number one, where is the national apology to InfoWars and Natural News and all the others in independent media who have covered this, right?
[03:25:21.223 --> 03:25:22.425]  Because we've been warning about this.
[03:25:22.845 --> 03:25:23.766]  For over two decades.
[03:25:23.806 --> 03:25:25.767]  I know you in particular, Alex, you were ahead of this.
[03:25:25.787 --> 03:25:29.729]  I mean, you were covering this in the 1990s and warning people about it.
[03:25:30.190 --> 03:25:36.473]  And, you know, of course they just call everybody a conspiracy theory until one day suddenly it's in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[03:25:37.094 --> 03:25:38.815]  Oh, you were right the whole time.
[03:25:39.455 --> 03:25:46.217]  But the other part of this... And by the way, we're just right because it's on its face, but you're actually an engineer and scientist and you have scientists working for you.
[03:25:46.598 --> 03:25:52.940]  We specifically said it targets boys, African-Americans even more, and that it's causing bone cancer as well and lowering IQ.
[03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:56.221]  And exactly what we've been saying is exactly what they found.
[03:25:56.441 --> 03:25:59.382]  And they said it's a very stringent, in-depth, very deep study.
[03:26:00.652 --> 03:26:03.213]  Well, I'm going to add to that also today.
[03:26:03.233 --> 03:26:09.476]  You're exactly right, but I've got another study here just published from Christopher Exley, a researcher in the UK.
[03:26:09.816 --> 03:26:16.739]  Prescription infant formulas are intentionally contaminated with aluminum, another neurotoxic.
[03:26:17.419 --> 03:26:18.059]  And guess what?
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:25.523]  The formulas that are marketed to prevent asthma and, you know, for sensitive babies, they have the most aluminum in them.
[03:26:25.783 --> 03:26:26.643]  And let's stop right there.
[03:26:26.683 --> 03:26:28.864]  Actually, this is an admitted eugenics program.
[03:26:29.264 --> 03:26:37.028]  The Bayer documents came out 12 years ago that they knew HIV was in their factor VIII product on purpose, and they said, well, we're getting rid of hemophiliacs.
[03:26:37.308 --> 03:26:38.969]  So these are very cold-blooded people.
[03:26:38.989 --> 03:26:40.109]  Can you speak to the mindset?
[03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:41.810]  The key is this is on purpose.
[03:26:42.984 --> 03:26:55.295]  Yeah, well actually what I'm going to do today is connect the dots about how this is a war on not just humanity, but you notice that all of these vectors that are attacking people, they tend to attack young black males.
[03:26:55.656 --> 03:26:58.879]  This is a eugenics war on young black males.
[03:26:59.279 --> 03:27:04.484]  So vaccines cause autism at much higher rates in young black male infants.
[03:27:04.884 --> 03:27:05.084]  Right.
[03:27:05.524 --> 03:27:10.386]  And then, of course, not only do vaccines have aluminum, but then the infant formula has aluminum.
[03:27:10.726 --> 03:27:14.287]  And now we know that fluoride attacks males more than females as well.
[03:27:14.307 --> 03:27:17.208]  And then, of course, we have abortion and infanticide.
[03:27:17.648 --> 03:27:31.032]  And I say the number one target right now of the establishment, which is the science establishment, the medical establishment, the abortion industry and the globalists, is that they want to mass murder black people everywhere around the world.
[03:27:31.492 --> 03:27:33.673]  And as I'll mention, I'll cover today how this goes back
[03:27:34.233 --> 03:27:37.677]  Decades when they wanted to put infertility chemicals into the food supply.
[03:27:37.697 --> 03:27:39.318]  By the way, this is not your opinion.
[03:27:39.338 --> 03:27:48.527]  When they set up the eugenics boards, the city health departments, that was set up under the eugenicists and racial hygiene.
[03:27:49.007 --> 03:27:53.772]  And so that's why the left puts out all this race stuff saying, oh, if you want blacks to be successful, you're a racist.
[03:27:54.032 --> 03:27:57.035]  They want blacks under their control so they never saw what hit them.
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:03.244]  Well yeah, and they absolutely remember that the attack on neurology is an attack on human freedom.
[03:28:03.725 --> 03:28:13.153]  And they, the globalists in the establishment, they want especially, they want black people to be neurologically damaged so they can be easily controlled by people like Mad Maxine.
[03:28:13.733 --> 03:28:29.387]  I mean, they want to be able to control black populations to force-feed them disinformation and hate to whip up race wars all over America while they're forcing black people to live in poverty and rat-infested liberal cities that are collapsing all around them.
[03:28:29.768 --> 03:28:30.789]  They want the brain damage.
[03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:36.292]  Alex, this is a modern day chemical weapons plantation enforcement system.
[03:28:36.832 --> 03:28:37.793]  It's nothing less than that.
[03:28:38.273 --> 03:28:38.693]  That's it.
[03:28:38.733 --> 03:28:40.214]  Blacks are particularly targeted.
[03:28:40.875 --> 03:28:41.855]  They've done studies too.
[03:28:41.875 --> 03:28:46.918]  They find in these city water supplies that the mainly black areas suddenly have higher levels.
[03:28:46.938 --> 03:28:47.558]  They don't know why.
[03:28:47.839 --> 03:28:49.660]  No, they're adding more to hit them.
[03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:53.982]  Oh, but you'll never hear Mad Maxine talk about that because she's a plantation owner.
[03:28:54.482 --> 03:28:57.704]  She's a house slave to kill the black people, literally.
[03:28:57.984 --> 03:29:00.246]  Planned Parenthood is set up to kill black people as well.
[03:29:02.847 --> 03:29:05.628]  President Trump was sworn in in January of 2017.
[03:29:05.689 --> 03:29:12.892]  The average farm journal and poll had him at about 50% with farmers.
[03:29:13.573 --> 03:29:28.200]  Fast forward to August 2019, two and a half years later, and he's at 79% in the farm journal survey, which is the most respected, and other farm journals show him as high as 90%.
[03:29:29.801 --> 03:29:35.971]  No president since these journals have existed has had numbers this high.
[03:29:36.491 --> 03:29:38.274]  Now why am I so excited about that?
[03:29:38.354 --> 03:29:39.456]  Why am I so proud of that?
[03:29:42.200 --> 03:29:44.023]  Farmers got assaulted by the Democrats.
[03:29:45.009 --> 03:29:46.870]  They're trying to take some of their subsidies away.
[03:29:47.691 --> 03:29:52.033]  Trump came in and was reasonable about it and said, hey, foreign countries have internal tariffs.
[03:29:52.173 --> 03:29:52.994]  I'll get rid of those.
[03:29:53.434 --> 03:29:57.496]  We don't need all these subsidies, but we'll actually let you compete directly into those markets.
[03:29:58.317 --> 03:30:02.499]  And when China put massive tariffs on U.S.
[03:30:02.539 --> 03:30:05.781]  farmers, their support for Trump only went up.
[03:30:06.242 --> 03:30:11.405]  And then, when China banned a week ago all U.S.
[03:30:11.425 --> 03:30:11.805]  produce
[03:30:14.022 --> 03:30:14.902]  Trump's numbers went up.
[03:30:15.683 --> 03:30:19.564]  Now, I talk about this all the time, but this is the key to everything.
[03:30:20.425 --> 03:30:31.429]  When Americans and free people know they're being dominated and assaulted and bullied, and they know that it's artificial and that it's from outside, they will rally and come together every time.
[03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:36.792]  You know, I harp on this constantly, that these globalists, the Democrats, are bullies.
[03:30:37.792 --> 03:30:54.138]  And they think that if they attack us, and lie about us, and call us Nazis, and physically come after us, and dox our homes, and tell us the American flag sucks, and that America's bad, that somehow we'll become demoralized, and kneel to them, bow to them.
[03:30:55.539 --> 03:30:56.319]  That's not what's happening.
[03:30:57.420 --> 03:31:00.861]  Americans were asleep before, because they thought everything was fine.
[03:31:02.116 --> 03:31:04.297]  Now Americans know that the country's in peril.
[03:31:04.657 --> 03:31:06.617]  And they know that Trump at Infowars is fighting.
[03:31:07.637 --> 03:31:09.538]  And so now they're ready for a war.
[03:31:10.098 --> 03:31:11.098]  They're ready for a battle.
[03:31:12.038 --> 03:31:18.820]  And so when the CHICOMs come in and say, we're going to put tariffs on your goods, they say, oh, we support Trump more.
[03:31:20.260 --> 03:31:28.502]  And then when they say, we're banning all your food, we're going to all cost each one of your families a large piece of their paycheck, because China imports a lot of food from us they can't produce.
[03:31:29.725 --> 03:31:30.645]  That's fine, go ahead and do that.
[03:31:31.145 --> 03:31:33.386]  Because you've been screwing our industry over forever.
[03:31:33.606 --> 03:31:39.388]  And the farmers get what the Rust Belt and the factories and the workers have gone through, and they're standing up.
[03:31:39.408 --> 03:31:45.129]  Because farmers have a long history in this country of standing up to tyranny because they understand how the system operates.
[03:31:45.149 --> 03:31:47.770]  And Thomas Jefferson said it'll be the yeoman farmers
[03:31:48.470 --> 03:31:58.357]  That will end up being the heart of this country, and when the country's in crisis, it'll be the farmers who are close to the ground, and close to the earth, and close to reality, who are going to be the ones that save the nation.
[03:31:58.777 --> 03:32:11.206]  So I'm so proud of America's farmers, for a race, color, and creed, who are the heartland of this nation, and who understand that, hey, you try to intimidate me, you try to bully me, because our president stood up for our industry?
[03:32:11.846 --> 03:32:17.971]  We're ready to take it on the chin in this fight because we understand it's for a greater good.
[03:32:18.391 --> 03:32:26.117]  America had surrendered for 50 years to globalism and de-industrialization and 30 years selling our jobs out to China.
[03:32:26.477 --> 03:32:28.178]  And that surrender is open.
[03:32:28.959 --> 03:32:29.940]  But I'll say this to farmers.
[03:32:30.700 --> 03:32:31.641]  You think you're under attack?
[03:32:32.121 --> 03:32:33.422]  InfoWars is under attack as well.
[03:32:33.462 --> 03:32:36.024]  And I notice that it's farming families that really support us.
[03:32:36.044 --> 03:32:37.085]  You're our strongest group.
[03:32:37.105 --> 03:32:39.527]  You understand that we're in the same position you're in.
[03:32:39.827 --> 03:32:40.848]  You think you've been sanctioned?
[03:32:41.608 --> 03:32:43.290]  They have unleashed hell on us, but you know what?
[03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:55.921]  We're still here because of you, so please, whether it's coffee, or toothpaste, or fish oil, or turmeric, we got great products at great prices at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and your financial support is what keeps us here as well.
[03:32:56.441 --> 03:32:57.942]  So, the globalists have sanctioned us?
[03:32:58.743 --> 03:33:02.206]  That's okay, because the farmers of America are standing with us, and we stand with you.
[03:33:05.989 --> 03:33:08.652]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.071 --> 03:33:19.199]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[03:33:19.659 --> 03:33:23.506]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:27.076 --> 03:33:30.659]  Black Americans have every right to be beyond angry.
[03:33:31.480 --> 03:33:41.408]  Generations of chemical assaults that have been waged against them, heavy metals assault, but you know it's not right to be angry just at least like in a Black Lives Matter kind of way.
[03:33:41.948 --> 03:33:51.596]  The real enemies of Black America are the science establishment, the dental industry, the medical industry, and that's what I'm going to explain here in this segment.
[03:33:51.656 --> 03:33:52.977]  They are literally trying to
[03:33:53.803 --> 03:33:57.564]  Annihilate, to mass murder black people all across America.
[03:33:57.584 --> 03:34:04.286]  And if they can't murder you, they want to damage your brains, to cause confusion, to cause lowered IQs.
[03:34:04.706 --> 03:34:07.546]  They want to kill your babies or convince you to kill your own babies.
[03:34:07.586 --> 03:34:08.487]  This is what's going on.
[03:34:09.787 --> 03:34:21.890]  This all begins with, of course, the big breaking news, Journal of the American Medical Association, a pediatric version of that, talking about how, of course, fluoride now is known to lower the IQs of children.
[03:34:22.759 --> 03:34:25.399]  Especially affecting males more than females.
[03:34:26.260 --> 03:34:33.321]  When women are pregnant, that's the study, and they consume fluoride, then it damages the brains of the developing babies.
[03:34:34.601 --> 03:34:35.781]  The unborn babies.
[03:34:36.021 --> 03:34:48.203]  Now, if that baby survives the abortion advocates that want to mass murder everything that's born alive, by the way, then that baby will go on to suffer extreme brain damage or lowered IQs, depending on their level of exposure.
[03:34:49.244 --> 03:34:50.904]  Now, the establishment doesn't stop at that.
[03:34:51.733 --> 03:34:58.845]  Remember, this is a massive chemical weapons assault on all humans, but especially African Americans.
[03:34:59.466 --> 03:35:00.788]  And I guess Africans all around the world.
[03:35:03.024 --> 03:35:07.546]  Well, they want to put mercury fillings in the mouths of black children.
[03:35:08.046 --> 03:35:09.447]  The dental industry pushes that.
[03:35:09.487 --> 03:35:12.108]  The same dental industry that pushes the fluoride.
[03:35:12.529 --> 03:35:14.790]  They also push mercury fillings.
[03:35:14.830 --> 03:35:16.791]  Of course, they don't call them mercury, right?
[03:35:16.811 --> 03:35:21.313]  They call them silver or amalgam, but they're about 50% mercury.
[03:35:21.413 --> 03:35:25.355]  Mercury is another neurotoxin, just like fluoride is a neurotoxin.
[03:35:26.118 --> 03:35:26.658]  And guess what?
[03:35:27.158 --> 03:35:30.960]  Black children get more mercury fillings than white children.
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:31.520]  You know why?
[03:35:32.120 --> 03:35:40.923]  Because dentists have a slogan, especially in inner cities where it's all paid by insurance or, you know, Medicaid or Medicare type of coverage.
[03:35:41.423 --> 03:35:45.045]  They call it Drill, Fill, and Bill.
[03:35:46.085 --> 03:35:51.367]  It's about billing the government for as much money as you can by drilling and filling as many holes as you can
[03:35:52.256 --> 03:35:52.877]  We're good to go.
[03:36:09.699 --> 03:36:14.560]  Black Americans in the inner cities, and dentists are making a killing doing that in the inner cities.
[03:36:14.940 --> 03:36:28.243]  By the way, there's also a huge cancer industry that makes money off of black people in inner cities, like Detroit, for example, where there are massive cancer scams, where they falsely diagnose every black person with cancer, even when they don't have it.
[03:36:28.763 --> 03:36:34.004]  In fact, one doctor, Dr. Fareed Fattah, was actually arrested by the FBI
[03:36:34.944 --> 03:36:47.273]  Charged, prosecuted, and I think he's in prison for 24 years or something like that because he ran a massive cancer scam giving chemotherapy to black people who didn't even have cancer.
[03:36:47.693 --> 03:36:48.554]  That was his scam.
[03:36:48.954 --> 03:36:51.856]  And of course targeting black people in order to accomplish that.
[03:36:52.797 --> 03:36:53.377]  So let's see.
[03:36:53.978 --> 03:36:58.581]  We've got chemotherapy targeting black people.
[03:36:58.761 --> 03:37:00.002]  It's also aluminum.
[03:37:00.797 --> 03:37:10.392]  So, there's a new study that just came out, I promised to bring in today, it's called Prescription Infant Formulas Are Contaminated With Aluminum.
[03:37:11.133 --> 03:37:15.460]  The spelling is British, so it's aluminium, if you're looking for that online.
[03:37:16.252 --> 03:37:19.233]  And it's by Christopher Exley and other researchers.
[03:37:19.253 --> 03:37:23.493]  This was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
[03:37:24.054 --> 03:37:29.955]  And it shows, of course, that these prescription infant formulas are loaded with aluminum.
[03:37:30.455 --> 03:37:38.656]  And in fact, there's more aluminum in the formulas that are determined to be of use to infants who have allergies.
[03:37:39.096 --> 03:37:42.497]  So sensitive infants are subjected to more aluminum.
[03:37:43.263 --> 03:37:45.065]  Than the regular infant formulas.
[03:37:45.105 --> 03:37:46.065]  So this just came out.
[03:37:46.145 --> 03:37:48.568]  Aluminum is neurotoxic, by the way.
[03:37:48.628 --> 03:37:52.611]  So why are they putting it into infant formulas to feed to babies?
[03:37:52.651 --> 03:37:56.054]  And these are prescription formulas that are prescribed by doctors.
[03:37:56.314 --> 03:37:56.554]  OK.
[03:37:57.455 --> 03:38:01.018]  Now, on top of that, you've got aluminum in the vaccines.
[03:38:01.438 --> 03:38:08.244]  Now, aluminum in vaccines, of course, is another neurotoxic chemical on top of the mercury in vaccines.
[03:38:08.684 --> 03:38:10.266]  Are you starting to see a pattern here?
[03:38:11.013 --> 03:38:17.638]  And they want the black babies especially to get vaccinated with as many injections at the youngest age possible.
[03:38:18.378 --> 03:38:22.641]  Even though a whistleblower who worked for the CDC, I think he's still there.
[03:38:23.704 --> 03:38:45.937]  A top scientist at the CDC blew the whistle a couple years ago, went public, posted a statement with his attorney saying that he was part of a massive scientific cover-up at the CDC where they covered up the evidence that vaccines cause autism at much higher rates in black babies compared to white babies or non-black babies.
[03:38:46.617 --> 03:38:49.939]  There were other races and origins involved in the study as well.
[03:38:50.620 --> 03:38:51.000]  I think
[03:38:51.966 --> 03:38:58.692]  I think it was 420% increase among African American infants, but I'd have to double check and make sure that statistic is correct.
[03:38:58.852 --> 03:39:00.994]  In any case, it's a substantial increase.
[03:39:01.695 --> 03:39:04.317]  So now we know that vaccines are targeting black babies.
[03:39:04.657 --> 03:39:07.580]  We know infant formulas targeting all babies with aluminum.
[03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:11.163]  We know that the fluoride
[03:39:11.730 --> 03:39:11.850]  Yes.
[03:39:28.977 --> 03:39:31.258]  The black community there that provides tap water.
[03:39:31.679 --> 03:39:42.504]  It had over a hundred parts per million of lead in the tap water at certain times because the City Council decided to alter the water source and change the pH.
[03:39:43.065 --> 03:39:47.787]  Now this, my friends, this is a war on humanity.
[03:39:48.488 --> 03:39:54.351]  It is a chemical weapons, multi-layered, multi-vector warfare system.
[03:39:55.296 --> 03:40:02.987]  And the warfare system is designed to damage the neurology of human beings because that is the new enslavement.
[03:40:03.928 --> 03:40:06.051]  Understand why this is so crucial.
[03:40:07.023 --> 03:40:12.586]  And share all of this with everybody you know who might find this relevant and interesting.
[03:40:12.926 --> 03:40:17.628]  And you can even say, hey, look, there's this white guy scientist talking about how black babies are being targeted.
[03:40:17.648 --> 03:40:18.488]  Yeah, it's true.
[03:40:18.709 --> 03:40:19.689]  I did a whole talk on this.
[03:40:19.749 --> 03:40:23.411]  It's called the Science Agenda to Exterminate Blacks.
[03:40:23.891 --> 03:40:24.811]  I did a whole lecture on it.
[03:40:24.832 --> 03:40:27.553]  It's out there on brighteon.com, I think, still, if you want to see it.
[03:40:27.893 --> 03:40:29.934]  But this is all about
[03:40:30.737 --> 03:40:44.088]  Destroying the neurology to cause mental IQ damage to the establishment is trying to make people, especially black people, incapable of questioning their slavery.
[03:40:44.128 --> 03:40:46.811]  This is modern day neurological slavery.
[03:40:46.891 --> 03:40:49.573]  This is the scientific plantation.
[03:40:50.279 --> 03:41:02.671]  To keep you on that plantation instead of chopping off a foot like they would do to a slave in the old days, they chop off part of your brain with a chemical lobotomy and heavy metals so you can't question your reality.
[03:41:02.691 --> 03:41:13.642]  You can never rise up and escape the liberal city traps that they have you trapped in and tell you to keep voting for Democrats who keep you enslaved in the same system of poverty and destitution.
[03:41:14.302 --> 03:41:21.409]  And literal, chemically induced mental retardation of your children and mass abortion of your children because you are black.
[03:41:22.029 --> 03:41:33.960]  This is what's happening in America today and this is run by Democrats, this is run by the scientific establishment, this is run by the vaccine industry, the dental industry, the medical industry, the psychiatric drugging of black children.
[03:41:34.721 --> 03:41:35.742]  This is genocide.
[03:41:36.374 --> 03:41:41.899]  And it is taking place in America today, and it has nothing to do with the slavery that was ended over a hundred years ago.
[03:41:41.939 --> 03:41:45.261]  This is a whole new modern-day chemical weapons slavery system.
[03:41:46.002 --> 03:41:50.005]  And it's in operation right now, and it's run by Democrats and the scientific establishment.
[03:41:50.866 --> 03:41:55.289]  And we, we the independent media, we've been sounding the alarm on this for decades.
[03:41:56.090 --> 03:41:57.751]  Alex Jones warned you about this.
[03:41:58.011 --> 03:41:59.212]  I warned you about this.
[03:41:59.973 --> 03:42:02.455]  Natural News, we all warned about this.
[03:42:02.515 --> 03:42:05.958]  We've been warning about this for a couple of decades, if not more.
[03:42:06.846 --> 03:42:08.908]  And we were silenced and we were censored.
[03:42:10.049 --> 03:42:15.013]  And Google gave all the links to the media that said, oh, there's no problem with fluoride.
[03:42:15.413 --> 03:42:16.694]  Fluoride doesn't damage anything.
[03:42:16.714 --> 03:42:18.015]  There's no problem with heavy metals.
[03:42:18.035 --> 03:42:19.776]  There's no problem with aluminum.
[03:42:19.817 --> 03:42:20.937]  There's no problem with vaccines.
[03:42:21.378 --> 03:42:22.279]  They were all fake news.
[03:42:23.519 --> 03:42:28.984]  But we were the ones that got banned because we dared to speak up.
[03:42:29.929 --> 03:42:32.930]  For the victims of this massive chemical assault.
[03:42:33.210 --> 03:42:39.832]  Do you realize that if you dump fluoride into the water supply right now, you would be arrested for chemical terrorism?
[03:42:40.732 --> 03:42:44.253]  And yet every city across America has been doing it for decades.
[03:42:45.013 --> 03:42:45.353]  Why?
[03:42:45.713 --> 03:42:46.833]  Why are they getting away with that?
[03:42:47.494 --> 03:42:53.115]  Where are the arrests of those city officials who mass poisoned their people with fluoride in the water?
[03:42:53.875 --> 03:42:54.735]  Important questions.
[03:42:54.775 --> 03:42:56.796]  We'll be back with more here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:43:02.243 --> 03:43:11.572]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[03:43:11.632 --> 03:43:13.834]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[03:43:14.054 --> 03:43:14.895]  This is not a movie.
[03:43:14.915 --> 03:43:15.735]  This is not a drill.
[03:43:15.775 --> 03:43:16.636]  This is not fiction.
[03:43:17.097 --> 03:43:18.378]  This is reality.
[03:43:19.079 --> 03:43:25.864]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[03:43:26.044 --> 03:43:29.127]  Pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[03:43:29.167 --> 03:43:30.568]  So, Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[03:43:30.588 --> 03:43:31.288]  And I'll say this.
[03:43:31.508 --> 03:43:32.549]  It's all of our birthright.
[03:43:32.609 --> 03:43:38.333]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[03:43:38.393 --> 03:43:40.535]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[03:43:40.555 --> 03:43:45.559]  We're seeing election meddling, and it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor.
[03:43:45.899 --> 03:43:46.119]  I think?
[03:44:01.883 --> 03:44:06.569]  We wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[03:44:06.689 --> 03:44:12.056]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[03:44:12.176 --> 03:44:19.325]  It's the big, giant, 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, but only on 50-something items, not.
[03:44:19.485 --> 03:44:21.986]  On every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[03:44:22.046 --> 03:44:31.869]  Whether it's Ultimate Krill Oil, Body's Turmeric, Brain Force Plus, Knockout Sleep Aid, Turbo Force, 8-Pack Power Stack, it's all 50-60% off, and your purchases make it all possible here.
[03:44:31.969 --> 03:44:43.812]  But an incredible time to be alive, an incredible time to be making history together, and standing up and seeing the good guys wake up, and to see us coming back from zero to basically tying the Globalists right now for a football analogy.
[03:44:44.032 --> 03:44:46.293]  So back to Owen Schroer and Zach Vortes.
[03:44:46.553 --> 03:44:49.354]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to U.S.
[03:44:49.395 --> 03:44:49.835]  elections?
[03:44:50.295 --> 03:44:57.539]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's Google together with Facebook, together with Twitter.
[03:44:57.739 --> 03:45:09.165]  They formed this echo chamber in which if they want to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going to press down the voices.
[03:45:09.745 --> 03:45:12.587]  ...that they don't want, and they're going to boost up the voices that they do.
[03:45:12.667 --> 03:45:17.090]  And InfoWars has been sort of the main victim in this.
[03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:30.139]  And it's clear that if your audience looks through the disclosure list posted at ProjectVeritas.com, they're going to see InfoWars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[03:45:30.319 --> 03:45:35.741]  Google's mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
[03:45:35.881 --> 03:45:41.222]  When InfoWars was taken offline, was that making information universally accessible and useful?
[03:45:41.242 --> 03:45:41.862]  No, it wasn't.
[03:45:42.102 --> 03:45:48.624]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[03:45:48.684 --> 03:45:49.285]  elections?
[03:45:49.765 --> 03:45:53.826]  And what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[03:45:55.018 --> 03:45:57.620]  Yeah, well, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[03:45:57.800 --> 03:45:59.541]  Like, there's been a huge document dump.
[03:45:59.601 --> 03:46:04.864]  I've released over 950 pages, and right now there is a crowd raid.
[03:46:05.825 --> 03:46:14.830]  There are a bunch of users, they're looking at these documents, they're digesting them, and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[03:46:15.411 --> 03:46:20.434]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online
[03:46:21.544 --> 03:46:24.366]  Go to Project Veritas, see their disclosure.
[03:46:24.386 --> 03:46:26.247]  They posted a link to all these documents.
[03:46:26.428 --> 03:46:31.111]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything.zip file and just go to town.
[03:46:31.251 --> 03:46:36.094]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google's doing, I promise you, it's way, way worse.
[03:46:36.294 --> 03:46:40.977]  And, you know, I see the reaction online and everyone's like, you know, WTF?
[03:46:41.237 --> 03:46:41.817]  WTF?
[03:46:41.937 --> 03:46:47.081]  And I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen privately.
[03:46:47.101 --> 03:46:48.662]  And, you know,
[03:46:49.182 --> 03:46:57.909]  We're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness and people are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[03:47:05.495 --> 03:47:08.158]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.474 --> 03:47:18.455]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:47:18.855 --> 03:47:22.797]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:24.338 --> 03:47:29.381]  You know, it's always an honor to be here and to be able to bring you this information.
[03:47:29.401 --> 03:47:34.103]  And yeah, I get angry about the war on humanity.
[03:47:34.563 --> 03:47:45.389]  I get angry and I express that openly when I see the mass organized mass murder of babies and entire races.
[03:47:46.263 --> 03:47:51.905]  Are targeted for extermination right now on our planet and it's all it's in your face now.
[03:47:52.466 --> 03:47:53.446]  It's not a hidden agenda.
[03:47:54.166 --> 03:47:55.267]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:47:55.307 --> 03:47:56.287]  It's all out in the open.
[03:47:56.307 --> 03:48:02.890]  I mean, you've got now the mainstream saying water filters are bad that you're supposed to drink maximum poison.
[03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:12.414]  How dare you filter your water and have clean water and protect your brain from fluoride or arsenic or toxic heavy metals or pesticides that might be in your water.
[03:48:12.435 --> 03:48:13.435]  How dare you filter that?
[03:48:14.096 --> 03:48:16.697]  You're supposed to drink the poisons that they have prescribed for you.
[03:48:17.678 --> 03:48:18.578]  That's out in the open now.
[03:48:19.719 --> 03:48:20.639]  Water filters are bad.
[03:48:20.679 --> 03:48:22.860]  They say carbon dioxide is bad.
[03:48:22.880 --> 03:48:25.381]  I mean, carbon dioxide is bad?
[03:48:26.042 --> 03:48:37.747]  It's the number one most important nutrient for every plant on Earth that grows the food, that grows the herbs, all the seeds, all the fruits and vegetables, everything grown because of carbon dioxide.
[03:48:38.516 --> 03:48:39.357]  Photosynthesis.
[03:48:39.457 --> 03:48:40.057]  Chlorophyll.
[03:48:40.357 --> 03:48:43.920]  I mean, go back to, you know, Science 101 in high school.
[03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:45.241]  Chlorophyll.
[03:48:45.801 --> 03:48:46.602]  Photosynthesis.
[03:48:46.642 --> 03:48:47.603]  This is how plants live.
[03:48:47.643 --> 03:48:48.323]  Carbon dioxide.
[03:48:48.343 --> 03:48:52.746]  But the insane, delusional, anti-human left says carbon dioxide's bad.
[03:48:52.766 --> 03:48:55.008]  And they have to get rid of carbon dioxide.
[03:48:56.028 --> 03:48:57.328]  They say organics are all bad.
[03:48:57.348 --> 03:48:58.428]  They say nutrition is bad.
[03:48:58.489 --> 03:49:01.329]  Google's now banning natural health websites.
[03:49:01.369 --> 03:49:04.050]  Google's banning information that promotes organics.
[03:49:04.470 --> 03:49:11.251]  If you speak out against GMOs, against vaccines, against pesticides, against heavy metals, you are now censored.
[03:49:11.591 --> 03:49:13.751]  Because Google wants you to be poisoned.
[03:49:14.171 --> 03:49:23.213]  Because Google is so evil, it is part of this massive chemical assault, multi-layered, multi-vectored system to destroy humanity.
[03:49:24.125 --> 03:49:27.647]  And in order to do that, they have to destroy information first, and they have to destroy free speech.
[03:49:27.727 --> 03:49:30.268]  But just understand, this is all out in the open now.
[03:49:30.808 --> 03:49:37.311]  You are supposed to eat your poison, and you're supposed to like it, and you're supposed to worship your slave masters.
[03:49:38.092 --> 03:49:40.353]  That's the message from the system.
[03:49:40.693 --> 03:49:43.715]  How dare you try to have clean food and clean water.
[03:49:44.335 --> 03:49:45.756]  And I tell you, it's so insane.
[03:49:46.816 --> 03:49:50.298]  I'm even going to quote here from none other than Piers Morgan.
[03:49:50.978 --> 03:49:52.539]  Yes, Piers Morgan.
[03:49:53.243 --> 03:50:01.547]  Former CNN host, Piers Morgan, even though he's a crazy gun control nut, he's starting to get it about how insane liberals are.
[03:50:01.948 --> 03:50:03.849]  And there's a video of him out there today.
[03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:08.811]  He says, populism is rising because liberals have become unbearable.
[03:50:09.491 --> 03:50:10.632]  This is Piers Morgan again.
[03:50:11.252 --> 03:50:16.655]  The same Piers Morgan that interviewed Alex Jones a few years ago and, you know, was condemning Jones.
[03:50:17.255 --> 03:50:18.056]  Piers Morgan says,
[03:50:18.832 --> 03:50:19.853]  I speak as a liberal.
[03:50:20.353 --> 03:50:24.837]  Liberals have become utterly, pathetically illiberal, and it's a massive problem.
[03:50:25.798 --> 03:50:29.461]  What's the point of calling yourself a liberal if you don't allow anyone else to have a different view?
[03:50:29.781 --> 03:50:37.467]  This snowflake culture we operate in, this victimhood culture that everyone has to think a certain way, everyone has to have a bleeding heart.
[03:50:37.828 --> 03:50:41.431]  You say a joke ten years ago that offended somebody, you can never host the Oscars?
[03:50:42.391 --> 03:50:42.832]  He goes on.
[03:50:43.703 --> 03:50:46.865]  He says people are fed up with the snowflake, libtard culture, basically.
[03:50:46.905 --> 03:50:48.466]  This is what Piers Morgan is saying now.
[03:50:48.787 --> 03:50:49.247]  Hey, guess what?
[03:50:49.307 --> 03:50:50.548]  Piers Morgan is starting to get it.
[03:50:51.649 --> 03:50:52.289]  It's insane.
[03:50:53.410 --> 03:50:59.554]  The insanity has become the face of the Democrat Party and the face of everything that the left does.
[03:50:59.895 --> 03:51:05.699]  And this is why more and more people who didn't even vote for Trump in 2016 are now coming out in support of Trump.
[03:51:06.219 --> 03:51:08.000]  People are seeing what's happening to the Democrats.
[03:51:08.020 --> 03:51:09.962]  They're like, these people are insane.
[03:51:11.238 --> 03:51:15.061]  And this has implications on economics and the stock market, too.
[03:51:16.002 --> 03:51:17.162]  This is going to blow you away.
[03:51:17.623 --> 03:51:20.445]  You've probably heard of this company called WeWork, right?
[03:51:20.905 --> 03:51:22.326]  WeWork is about to go public.
[03:51:22.787 --> 03:51:32.434]  And they've issued some kind of report before going public that's being characterized as a quote, masterpiece of obfuscation.
[03:51:33.098 --> 03:51:38.960]  Now, WeWork is one of these virtue-signaling, liberal, left-wing IPOs.
[03:51:39.360 --> 03:51:43.001]  And there are a bunch of these now, where they really don't have much of a business model.
[03:51:43.021 --> 03:51:44.401]  They don't do anything special.
[03:51:44.882 --> 03:51:47.222]  They really don't offer much to the world.
[03:51:47.282 --> 03:51:49.743]  I mean, WeWork just basically rents office space to people.
[03:51:50.183 --> 03:51:55.445]  But then they claim, we're going to raise consciousness, and we're going to have consciousness capital.
[03:51:56.178 --> 03:52:01.866]  And we're going to change the world with this consciousness and our unique technology, which doesn't even exist.
[03:52:01.886 --> 03:52:04.630]  There's nothing unique about a database and a spreadsheet, by the way.
[03:52:04.911 --> 03:52:05.732]  That's not unique.
[03:52:06.112 --> 03:52:08.035]  I mean, an online reservation system, really?
[03:52:08.396 --> 03:52:09.778]  Airlines had that in the 1980s.
[03:52:09.998 --> 03:52:10.559]  That's not new.
[03:52:11.784 --> 03:52:12.825]  By the way, it's not new at all.
[03:52:13.325 --> 03:52:23.513]  But these young millennials are investing in companies like WeWork or Uber or other similar companies, even Tesla, because of the narrative.
[03:52:24.014 --> 03:52:25.375]  Oh, it's all virtue signaling.
[03:52:25.615 --> 03:52:27.377]  Oh, we're going to save the planet.
[03:52:27.397 --> 03:52:28.738]  We're going to change the world.
[03:52:28.758 --> 03:52:30.159]  We're going to raise consciousness.
[03:52:30.499 --> 03:52:32.240]  We're going to have consciousness capital.
[03:52:32.921 --> 03:52:35.343]  Or sometimes they call it conscious capitalism.
[03:52:36.428 --> 03:52:37.489]  But it's all BS.
[03:52:38.089 --> 03:52:39.990]  Because most of these companies don't make money.
[03:52:40.411 --> 03:52:41.351]  They all lose money.
[03:52:41.371 --> 03:52:43.533]  I mean, almost all of them lose money all the time.
[03:52:43.553 --> 03:52:45.174]  They're just burning through investor money.
[03:52:45.714 --> 03:52:49.256]  They don't offer anything really unique to the world.
[03:52:49.677 --> 03:52:51.598]  Now, by the way, I'm not shorting any of these companies.
[03:52:51.638 --> 03:52:53.119]  I'm not saying this out of my own self-interest.
[03:52:53.219 --> 03:52:55.040]  I don't... I'm not even in the stock market.
[03:52:56.081 --> 03:52:56.941]  I buy gold, okay?
[03:52:57.181 --> 03:52:58.082]  I buy physical gold.
[03:52:58.902 --> 03:52:59.563]  That's what I do.
[03:52:59.723 --> 03:53:01.164]  And ammunition, things like that.
[03:53:01.784 --> 03:53:02.505]  I'm not in the market.
[03:53:03.165 --> 03:53:05.006]  So, you know, get your own financial advice.
[03:53:05.046 --> 03:53:05.687]  But the point is,
[03:53:06.730 --> 03:53:11.614]  The liberal millennial investors have never seen a stock market crash because they're too young.
[03:53:12.314 --> 03:53:16.718]  And they're throwing all this money into these companies because they want a virtue signal.
[03:53:16.898 --> 03:53:18.359]  Oh, we invested in WeWork.
[03:53:18.779 --> 03:53:20.821]  We bought some Tesla stock.
[03:53:20.881 --> 03:53:22.642]  We bought some Uber stock.
[03:53:22.662 --> 03:53:23.763]  And they want to feel good.
[03:53:24.143 --> 03:53:24.664]  Well, guess what?
[03:53:25.885 --> 03:53:34.291]  These companies, I believe, in my assessment, are going to catastrophically crash one day worse than the original dot-com crash of 2000-2001.
[03:53:36.129 --> 03:53:37.210]  It's going to be catastrophic.
[03:53:37.230 --> 03:53:45.215]  A lot of these companies will lose 99% of their value like Dr. Coop did back in the first dot-com crash, which I also warned about, by the way, in 1998 and 1999.
[03:53:46.596 --> 03:53:49.778]  And these liberals, for the first time, they're going to see all their savings wiped out.
[03:53:50.239 --> 03:53:54.982]  And they're going to start to wonder, well, wait a minute, I thought that we did all the right things for virtue.
[03:53:55.042 --> 03:53:56.203]  I thought this was ethical.
[03:53:56.243 --> 03:53:57.543]  I thought we were saving the planet.
[03:53:58.024 --> 03:54:02.607]  No, you're investing in a lunatic left-wing scheme that doesn't make money and just burns cash.
[03:54:03.562 --> 03:54:17.385]  And, you know, the amazing thing about the free market is that if there are public investors who want to put money into bad ideas, the market will create companies based on bad ideas that will gladly consume their money.
[03:54:18.066 --> 03:54:19.246]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[03:54:19.266 --> 03:54:21.206]  It's a lesson in basic economics.
[03:54:21.806 --> 03:54:24.347]  Leftists create demand for bad ideas.
[03:54:24.927 --> 03:54:25.427]  So what do you know?
[03:54:25.447 --> 03:54:32.209]  There are all these companies that are based on bad ideas that are going to gladly take that liberal money and burn it and just obliterate it.
[03:54:32.791 --> 03:54:37.313]  And one day, and it's coming, one day all these liberals are going to say, where'd all the money go?
[03:54:38.934 --> 03:54:39.334]  Guess what?
[03:54:39.354 --> 03:54:41.095]  It went into a black hole of virtue signaling.
[03:54:41.495 --> 03:54:42.155]  That's where it went.
[03:54:42.776 --> 03:54:44.577]  And by the way, don't forget about Theranos.
[03:54:45.057 --> 03:54:49.679]  So Theranos was another company led by Elizabeth Holmes, who's now facing criminal charges.
[03:54:50.099 --> 03:54:54.381]  Theranos, they claimed they were going to change the world with a drop of blood from your finger.
[03:54:54.401 --> 03:54:55.962]  They were going to miniaturize 250 analytical blood tests.
[03:54:58.467 --> 03:55:00.189]  And they were going to have blood tests of everybody.
[03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:10.437]  In your home, a little device that you just put your finger in it and it takes a little drop of blood and you can tell what's going on with your heart and diabetes and all these biomarkers.
[03:55:10.998 --> 03:55:11.958]  It's going to change the world.
[03:55:12.199 --> 03:55:13.340]  Except the whole thing was a fraud.
[03:55:14.200 --> 03:55:16.642]  She made it all up.
[03:55:16.662 --> 03:55:19.204]  900 million dollars blown away.
[03:55:19.565 --> 03:55:21.566]  Billions of dollars in valuation gone.
[03:55:21.606 --> 03:55:24.269]  The company was actually disbanded last year.
[03:55:24.669 --> 03:55:26.631]  And then criminally charged, I think, by the DOJ.
[03:55:28.228 --> 03:55:32.432]  But it had a great story all along, and a lot of people invested in it.
[03:55:32.592 --> 03:55:34.293]  Oh, she's going to change the world!
[03:55:34.513 --> 03:55:39.497]  She's an entrepreneurial woman, she's a leader of our community, and she has heart.
[03:55:39.838 --> 03:55:40.879]  She's got feelings.
[03:55:41.639 --> 03:55:42.980]  That's what people are investing in.
[03:55:43.681 --> 03:55:44.822]  And they're going to lose every time.
[03:55:45.523 --> 03:55:47.724]  And they did lose every time when it came to Theranos.
[03:55:48.305 --> 03:55:55.591]  So, my word of caution in this is, when you invest in something, or you buy stocks or anything,
[03:55:57.029 --> 03:55:57.930]  Make sure it makes sense.
[03:55:58.011 --> 03:55:58.832]  Be rational about it.
[03:55:58.892 --> 03:56:01.836]  Don't virtue-signal with your investments.
[03:56:02.417 --> 03:56:06.262]  And a lot of these corporations now, they're publicly saying that all they're going to do now is virtue-signal.
[03:56:06.282 --> 03:56:08.946]  They're going to push transgenderism, and they're going to push gun control.
[03:56:09.367 --> 03:56:10.869]  And they don't even care about profits anymore.
[03:56:11.169 --> 03:56:11.530]  Guess what?
[03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:13.833]  Eventually, all those companies will go bankrupt.
[03:56:14.873 --> 03:56:18.096]  Because they've stopped functioning as a rational business.
[03:56:18.457 --> 03:56:20.298]  They've violated the laws of economics.
[03:56:20.799 --> 03:56:27.706]  According to analysts, by the way, and I haven't looked at this personally, but some analysts say General Electric is massively overstating its earnings.
[03:56:28.406 --> 03:56:30.348]  Some analysts say Disney is in trouble.
[03:56:30.969 --> 03:56:34.212]  Some analysts say, of course, Tesla is in big trouble.
[03:56:35.632 --> 03:56:40.915]  Not only do their cars spontaneously explode into balls of flame, maybe the company might do that one day.
[03:56:40.935 --> 03:56:41.256]  Who knows?
[03:56:41.636 --> 03:56:42.536]  I mean, it's so crazy.
[03:56:42.636 --> 03:56:48.380]  I get the feeling if Elon Musk bumps his head on a stairwell, he might spontaneously burst into flame.
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:48.720]  Who knows?
[03:56:49.601 --> 03:56:50.101]  J.P.
[03:56:50.161 --> 03:56:52.523]  Morgan may be in so much trouble.
[03:56:52.543 --> 03:57:00.308]  They actually own the ship that was busted carrying a billion dollars worth of cocaine busted in the port of Philadelphia.
[03:57:01.128 --> 03:57:01.408]  J.P.
[03:57:01.428 --> 03:57:02.209]  Morgan owned the ship.
[03:57:03.115 --> 03:57:07.317]  And you say, banks and money laundering and drug trafficking?
[03:57:07.337 --> 03:57:17.340]  Yeah, look at the history of HSBC, look at the history of JP Morgan, and you'll come to understand maybe what's really powering the financial system right now, because it's not rationality.
[03:57:17.721 --> 03:57:24.683]  A lot of it is just fraud, corruption, and, you know, fake promotions of things that won't work long term.
[03:57:25.324 --> 03:57:26.324]  So be cautious, people.
[03:57:27.310 --> 03:57:36.537]  Make your own decisions, get informed, but be cautious and keep tuning in to InfoWars.com where you'll get the real story on economics with other guests like Gerald Cilenti and many others.
[03:57:37.037 --> 03:57:39.179]  The War Room is coming up next with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:39.199 --> 03:57:40.399]  I always thank you for joining me.
[03:57:40.439 --> 03:57:41.760]  This is Mike Adams here at the Health Ranger.
[03:57:42.701 --> 03:57:45.663]  Stay tuned for Owen and, you know, take care of yourself.
[03:57:45.843 --> 03:57:46.284]  Be careful.
[03:57:46.664 --> 03:57:47.344]  Crazy world out there.
[03:57:47.384 --> 03:57:48.005]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:57.089 --> 03:58:11.213]  Every day I walk into the studio and I see all of the people working so hard against the tyranny of the left, against the tyranny of the globalists, and it just makes me think that all of these people are on the same page and they understand.
[03:58:11.853 --> 03:58:15.574]  They are awake to what is actually happening here.
[03:58:16.434 --> 03:58:20.855]  And Alex Jones has created something that is completely remarkable.
[03:58:21.195 --> 03:58:25.316]  People understand that Alex Jones is doing everything he can.
[03:58:25.376 --> 03:58:30.478]  He's putting everything on the line to wake up people and to fight for humanity.
[03:58:30.678 --> 03:58:42.861]  And for me, that is a great honor to be sitting here to try to represent the best of my ability and show my appreciation and say that, you know, InfoWars is a wonderful opportunity for anybody.
[03:58:42.981 --> 03:58:47.523]  Without you supporting Infowars against what the left is doing, it doesn't happen.
[03:58:47.623 --> 03:58:51.384]  We don't have someone in the pocket like George Soros or Tom Steyer.
[03:58:51.544 --> 03:58:55.005]  All of these filthy rich billionaires are trying to take out America.
[03:58:55.265 --> 03:58:57.506]  Alex is depending on the American people.
[03:58:57.586 --> 03:58:59.647]  He's depending on all of us to step up.
