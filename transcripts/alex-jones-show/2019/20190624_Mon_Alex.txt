[00:00:04.182 --> 00:00:05.923]  Firm suspicions at Veritas.
[00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:12.187]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:15.288]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:19.811]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:40.478]  After just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam
[00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:43.904]  I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror.
[00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:45.645]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:55.710]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.333]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:05.654]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:08.376]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.750]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:12.472]  I will not let you down.
[00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:15.535]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:21.560]  He still calls Alex Jones and talks to him and, you know, the Info Wars.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.501]  Info Wars.
[00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.682]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:25.083]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:32.769]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:36.373]  The Russians ran an extensive information war.
[00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.050]  Okay.
[00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:25.202]  Allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:37.108]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:38.929]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:48.072]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppli, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:51.774]  Uh, InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[00:02:51.874 --> 00:03:01.182]  It's been widely reported that that company's been backed by the Kremlin and they gave you 75,000 shares that you had to disclose when you went into the Obama administration.
[00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:06.726]  Maybe you're, uh, looking at widely reported, uh, information from InfoWars.
[00:03:06.806 --> 00:03:07.947]  No, I'm not.
[00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.270]  This is Politico, this is the New York Times, this is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.931]  No, it's not.
[00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:23.562]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[00:03:23.883 --> 00:03:29.248]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:36.458]  Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source, but has made no further comments about the case.
[00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.942]  That murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:44.450]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel people I've talked to,
[00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:50.975]  Could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:52.576]  All that stuff exists.
[00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:59.481]  You don't see it, you don't feel it if you're largely living in reality and in a mainstream media world.
[00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:07.406]  But it's undermining our democracy and I think that the companies themselves, they've taken some steps.
[00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:08.867]  They have a lot of responsibility.
[00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:09.828]  Companies like Facebook?
[00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.609]  Companies like Facebook, Google, etc.
[00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.869]  Right.
[00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.593]  Do what they can to essentially not enhance this.
[00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:25.355]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight?
[00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:26.676]  The system self-corrected.
[00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:29.637]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:31.918]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:33.879]  But you saw this?
[00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:34.840]  USA Today.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.360]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.861]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:40.282]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:41.983]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:43.844]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:51.488]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him, and manually have to find that video.
[00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:57.030]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.733]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, was two years ago.
[00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.090]  Announcing the greatest show on earth!
[00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:17.575]  Reparations, free healthcare, free college, free homes, free money forever!
[00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:18.696]  Yay!
[00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.178]  It's Cloud World 2019!
[00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:26.844]  The Democratic Party's two-night extravaganza debate!
[00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:28.665]  Let's meet the candidates!
[00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:30.367]  All-Star!
[00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:31.388]  Beto O'Rourke!
[00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:32.849]  Oh my gosh!
[00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.030]  Cory Booker!
[00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.591]  The Amazing!
[00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:36.051]  Oh!
[00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:37.452]  Pocahontas!
[00:05:38.073 --> 00:05:39.394]  Joe Biden!
[00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:41.015]  Swallow's Whale Sizzle!
[00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:42.116]  New Gun Owners!
[00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:42.717]  Yay!
[00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:44.778]  Bernie Sanders!
[00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:46.339]  Love the Soviet Union!
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.921]  Camilla Harris!
[00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:49.362]  And so many more!
[00:05:49.842 --> 00:05:51.163]  It's the greatest show on Earth!
[00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:55.306]  Head into polewars.com forward slash show with live coverage next week!
[00:05:56.067 --> 00:06:03.031]  Wednesday and Thursday night.
[00:06:06.592 --> 00:06:08.793]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:14.536]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:15.837 --> 00:06:24.041]  The quickening is here.
[00:06:25.623 --> 00:06:29.165]  The best way to explain it is this, as I tend to do now on a routine basis.
[00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:36.610]  I've been on air 25 years plus now.
[00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.710]  25 years.
[00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:47.796]  And I would say maybe once in the first five years would I say this is the most important broadcast we've ever done.
[00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:54.160]  And then about 10 years ago I might say it once a year.
[00:06:55.794 --> 00:06:57.916]  About five years ago I'd say it about once a month.
[00:06:59.178 --> 00:07:06.486]  And now I say it about every week because each broadcast is just covering what's happening in the world and the developments are incredible.
[00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:10.970]  Gene-edited babies that are humanoids and aren't even human.
[00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:12.052]  They're not human.
[00:07:13.322 --> 00:07:15.163]  That have up to five parents.
[00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:18.663]  Humanoids have already been born in China for years.
[00:07:18.743 --> 00:07:20.364]  They've been born here for a long time.
[00:07:21.244 --> 00:07:23.625]  A lot of this got declassified more than 20 years ago.
[00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:26.366]  There are human clones walking around all over the place.
[00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.347]  But now it's all admitted in mainstream news.
[00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:37.248]  And I didn't even cover it yesterday when it was in the Associated Press on the Sunday show.
[00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:38.889]  It didn't even rate
[00:07:43.634 --> 00:08:02.178]  15,000 to 13,000 square miles of government-controlled mountains in West Virginia, where no cell phones are allowed, and where they're doing cancer studies, amongst other insane things, trying to make contacts with space aliens.
[00:08:03.638 --> 00:08:09.020]  By the way, if you just tune in to your radio listener and that sounds insane, yeah, it's the establishment, they're insane, they're mad scientists.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.020]  The land where the internet ends, New York Times.
[00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:19.385]  They admit the article, what it really is, is a refuge for people that are getting sick from electromagnetic radiation that's man-made.
[00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:21.205]  Like ultra-rich people!
[00:08:21.546 --> 00:08:22.526]  And they admit all that!
[00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:34.870]  I have literally dozens of articles that are so bombshell every day, I could spend the entire 3-4 hours on it.
[00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.391]  I spent almost the entire Sunday show just on this.
[00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:42.140]  Here's the problem with a quickening like this.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.962]  You'd think everybody would wake up when this big system emerges.
[00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:52.545]  That's not what happens in psychological warfare, as I had one of the heads of the big three megabanks privately tell me.
[00:08:54.386 --> 00:08:58.148]  Hard to believe it's now 14 years ago.
[00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:00.269]  Private conversation.
[00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:01.970]  Told you the conversation many times.
[00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.491]  Won't go back into the details.
[00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:07.893]  He said, Alex, you think they're going to adapt and fight it?
[00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:09.254]  They're going to adapt to it.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.301]  You don't adapt and overcome, you adapt and submit.
[00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:16.481]  You're a fool not to join us.
[00:09:18.142 --> 00:09:20.962]  The fact that you can see it means you should be with us.
[00:09:21.322 --> 00:09:22.243]  You can't help him.
[00:09:22.743 --> 00:09:29.224]  And the disdain he had for the general public, it was like a Howard Beale network conversation.
[00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:31.385]  Let's play that next segment.
[00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:34.685]  So here's what's going to happen.
[00:09:35.346 --> 00:09:37.066]  I'm not going to cover this piece of news.
[00:09:40.652 --> 00:09:41.712]  Until the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:42.773 --> 00:09:44.393]  And I don't even do it to build suspense.
[00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:49.835]  I have trouble catching my breath with the news we have.
[00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:56.437]  And then the constant feeling of not being good enough to be bringing you something like this.
[00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:09.862]  Because it's like you come to your neighbors whose kid's been kidnapped for a week, and you find out where the child is and they're safe, and you tell your neighbors
[00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:13.446]  And they don't even care.
[00:10:15.087 --> 00:10:16.167]  There's kind of that letdown.
[00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:23.910]  Where we just bring you so many bombshells, the Liberty Movement brings you so many bombshells, and you fight so hard to tell people.
[00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:30.433]  And the general public is the grassroots exposing all this tyranny.
[00:10:31.493 --> 00:10:35.615]  And other people act like you're the weirdo because you care.
[00:10:36.495 --> 00:10:38.116]  Now we're not bitching and complaining.
[00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.035]  We're just pointing out a phenomenon.
[00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:50.659]  And I'm saying, we have got to really get aggressive with people, authoritatively.
[00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:56.581]  And not back down to the left when they try to bully us, or try to make us be quiet.
[00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:58.442]  We have to say, hey!
[00:10:59.162 --> 00:11:00.483]  You're the one being enslaved!
[00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:01.423]  I'm your friend!
[00:11:01.903 --> 00:11:03.644]  You've been conditioned and brainwashed!
[00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:06.025]  This is bigger than both of us!
[00:11:06.605 --> 00:11:07.746]  And you better listen to me!
[00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:15.308]  But instead of spending our time on the sheeple, some can be reached.
[00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:16.688]  Don't feel bad when they don't listen.
[00:11:16.728 --> 00:11:22.891]  Who matters is decision makers, most of which are on the fence and are ready to be awakened.
[00:11:22.991 --> 00:11:39.297]  And that's why in WikiLeaks and other documents, the globalists admit, we played the clip last segment, they want InfoWars shut down because they found that managers and decision makers and leaders listen to me.
[00:11:40.444 --> 00:11:41.965]  And it's not a confidence issue.
[00:11:42.365 --> 00:11:43.846]  I know what I'm talking about here.
[00:11:43.866 --> 00:11:49.669]  And that's why Wired Magazine and the New York Times and all of them have said, he must be destroyed.
[00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:52.370]  He is the man's name that must not be spoken.
[00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.351]  He must be taken off the air.
[00:11:54.751 --> 00:11:56.492]  Because I believe in a pro-human future.
[00:11:56.872 --> 00:11:59.053]  And I believe you can be motivated to take action.
[00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.675]  And I believe you're not a piece of crap.
[00:12:02.215 --> 00:12:05.557]  And I believe if you're aware of this, you will adapt and overcome it!
[00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:09.899]  Not adapt and go away and submit and die!
[00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.127]  Bottom of the hour, I'm gonna hit it.
[00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:20.812]  And when I got up this morning at 6 a.m.
[00:12:20.852 --> 00:12:24.294]  and our lead producer Daria had text messaged me this article.
[00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:39.146]  The fact that James O'Keefe was on and I watched the entire 25-minute report and it brought up a hundred other pieces of evidence we had or more but it was devastating.
[00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:52.153]  So the headline on Infowars.com and Newswars.com for the live feed of the show with the audio and video feeds posted so you can share it more easily on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Google and everywhere else.
[00:12:52.533 --> 00:12:54.275]  Newswars.com is better to share.
[00:12:54.535 --> 00:12:57.317]  They don't censor or block that as much or penalize you for it.
[00:12:57.537 --> 00:12:59.239]  But use your text message, use your email.
[00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:01.361]  This needs to go mega viral.
[00:13:03.234 --> 00:13:03.975]  Breaking news!
[00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:07.757]  Project Veritas blows Google censorship conspiracy.
[00:13:08.057 --> 00:13:09.819]  And they admit it's a conspiracy on video.
[00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:14.182]  Thousands working in tandem to suppress your vote and steal the election.
[00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:15.703]  Election meddling!
[00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:19.586]  Not by the Ruskies, but by the Googlers.
[00:13:21.687 --> 00:13:22.828]  Sounds like a Batman villain.
[00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:23.729]  The Googler.
[00:13:24.289 --> 00:13:25.270]  Breaking news!
[00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.854]  Project Veritas blows Google censorship conspiracy wide open.
[00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:38.714]  Project Veritas reveals staggering proof that Google is a giant election meddling factory.
[00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:41.075]  I wrote that headline.
[00:13:41.095 --> 00:13:41.855]  I think we should change it.
[00:13:42.095 --> 00:13:42.395]  Army.
[00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:45.396]  It's an army.
[00:13:46.357 --> 00:13:47.657]  Meddling technocracy?
[00:13:47.797 --> 00:13:48.077]  Hmm.
[00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.318]  Factory technocracier army.
[00:13:53.106 --> 00:13:54.888]  Giant election meddling system.
[00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:55.368]  That's it.
[00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:55.848]  System.
[00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:57.310]  Change that to system.
[00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:04.295]  So Project Veritas reveals staggering proof that Google is a giant election meddling weapon system.
[00:14:04.456 --> 00:14:04.976]  That's it.
[00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:06.417]  Weapon system.
[00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:08.299]  Share this with everyone.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.361]  Well guess what?
[00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:11.782]  You're a weapon system.
[00:14:13.362 --> 00:14:23.341]  And if you simply decide to go get the article on InfoWars.com, yeah, let's just post the whole Veritas article and video under our live feed on the live feed article.
[00:14:23.422 --> 00:14:24.183]  That's the key!
[00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:34.956]  And let's hammer that sucker out with HUMET, human intelligence, over the machines, over the AI, and let's crush the Google censors!
[00:14:35.637 --> 00:14:46.225]  My God, when you watch this video that goes on for 25 minutes, because they always put out the unedited so they can't claim it's edited, they've won federal court cases where they claim they doctored video, and Veritas won.
[00:14:48.147 --> 00:14:49.107]  Veritas won.
[00:14:50.188 --> 00:14:51.910]  And when we get to this video, bottom of the hour,
[00:14:53.951 --> 00:15:00.973]  I mean, it is the top people at Google just bragging, Trump ain't winning in 2020, nothing like this is ever happening.
[00:15:01.293 --> 00:15:02.794]  We call this fairness.
[00:15:03.714 --> 00:15:04.774]  Everything with him is inversion.
[00:15:04.874 --> 00:15:07.975]  Total censorship, lying about it to Congress, is fairness.
[00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:13.457]  And they talk about how they lie to Congress on video, and how Congress can do nothing to stop them.
[00:15:13.777 --> 00:15:16.418]  They go, they may try, but we're not gonna stop.
[00:15:17.819 --> 00:15:20.539]  Just like Democrats in government don't follow the President's orders.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.160]  It's mutiny!
[00:15:23.414 --> 00:15:24.114]  On the bounty!
[00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:27.836]  And they're all weak and arrogant.
[00:15:27.856 --> 00:15:31.417]  They had to get dishonorable trash trained in the universities to do this.
[00:15:31.777 --> 00:15:33.337]  It's all coming up, bottom of the hour.
[00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:35.258]  Start your engines!
[00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:40.580]  And I've got all the backstory on it, too.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.520]  And then James O'Keefe joins us.
[00:15:44.021 --> 00:15:45.481]  Loaded for bear.
[00:15:46.822 --> 00:15:47.442]  In the third hour.
[00:15:49.051 --> 00:15:54.256]  This is the time for all of you to fire the bat signal and get this article out and circumvent them.
[00:15:54.456 --> 00:15:55.857]  It's at NewsWars.com.
[00:15:56.197 --> 00:15:57.258]  NewsWars.com.
[00:15:57.579 --> 00:15:58.599]  NewsWars.com.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.901]  NewsWars.com.
[00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:01.102]  NewsWars.com.
[00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:08.652]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on earth, Clown World.
[00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:18.038]  20 socialist, globalist, communist candidates, all in one spot for two nights only.

[00:16:24.363 --> 00:16:30.587]  Clown World, the greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[00:16:31.207 --> 00:16:32.949]  June 26th and 27th.
[00:16:32.989 --> 00:16:35.271]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:38.814]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:39.354 --> 00:16:40.935]  It's the greatest show on earth.
[00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:46.860]  A bunch of parasites, bitching and complaining, working for the Chi-Coms to overthrow America.
[00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:54.147]  Join us next Wednesday and Thursday for Clown World, the biggest show on earth!
[00:16:54.887 --> 00:16:55.947]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[00:16:56.308 --> 00:16:56.848]  I'm P.T.
[00:16:56.868 --> 00:16:57.208]  Barnum.
[00:16:57.588 --> 00:16:58.468]  I love the Democrats.
[00:16:58.888 --> 00:17:04.150]  Beto O'Rourke says the world's ending in 11 years and the borders should be open.
[00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.751]  There's so many other clowns.
[00:17:06.011 --> 00:17:11.773]  Cory Booker says pay reparations, even if 98% of whites didn't have ancestors that owned slaves.
[00:17:11.793 --> 00:17:14.394]  And then we move on to Pocahontas.
[00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:18.175]  She's whiter than anybody ever known in history, but it's okay.
[00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:18.955]  She's a fraud.
[00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:20.216]  And then Joe Biden.
[00:17:20.556 --> 00:17:23.277]  Well, Joe Biden loves segregationists and
[00:17:23.937 --> 00:17:24.638]  Bernie Sanders says,
[00:17:53.797 --> 00:18:01.682]  Thursday, for coverage of the Democratic Tonight's Debates, the greatest clown show on earth, at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:07.778]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:08.658]  Alpha Power.
[00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:12.340]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:21.144]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula, we can help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.
[00:18:21.524 --> 00:18:29.688]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[00:18:30.288 --> 00:18:35.249]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:42.370]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.191]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[00:18:46.611 --> 00:18:49.232]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[00:18:49.672 --> 00:18:53.412]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[00:18:53.712 --> 00:18:56.213]  Head to infowarsstore.com today.
[00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:08.707]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:13.533]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[00:19:14.174 --> 00:19:17.919]  And I keep trying to judge, engage, when is the right time
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.107]  To have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[00:19:24.668 --> 00:19:28.673]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real S.O.S.
[00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:34.862]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.520]  And so we've reached that point.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.141]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[00:19:39.201 --> 00:19:40.961]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:43.382]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:44.902]  You have been there.
[00:19:45.242 --> 00:19:49.983]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:55.645]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com.
[00:19:56.185 --> 00:19:56.845]  It's your fight.
[00:19:57.165 --> 00:20:01.466]  Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[00:20:06.423 --> 00:20:09.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.552 --> 00:20:35.852]  We have all the proof
[00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:49.993]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and their subsidiaries, and the rest of Silicon Valley, because they all want to be bought by Google, so they all do whatever they're told by Google, and Facebook, and Apple, as well as Twitter.
[00:20:50.893 --> 00:21:05.225]  Those big four gobble up thousands of companies a year, sometimes for 20 times what the company's worth, and their price-earnings ratio, to control and set up an oligopoly, a cartel, a linkage of monopolies.
[00:21:06.328 --> 00:21:11.210]  So whether you're on the internet or aren't, everything you do in your life is affected by this.
[00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:17.793]  And if they can manipulate that entire system and control the information, they rule it all.
[00:21:18.394 --> 00:21:19.454]  That really goes without saying.
[00:21:19.474 --> 00:21:22.876]  But remember the Republicans in the 2018 election?
[00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:25.917]  Not just in California, it turned out in other states.
[00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:30.579]  The entire Republican Party was listed as the Nazi Party.
[00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:33.861]  And that their affiliation was the Nazis.
[00:21:35.031 --> 00:21:36.272]  Google said it was a mistake.
[00:21:37.152 --> 00:21:39.313]  Once they got caught, it had been up for months.
[00:21:40.074 --> 00:21:44.536]  But the internal videos all show the perjury to Congress.
[00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:50.399]  The thuggish arrogance that they would not even work with the Pentagon on AI but give it to China.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.262]  They would lie to Congress and surveil everyone and then lie about that.
[00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.523]  It's all going to come home to roost.
[00:21:58.783 --> 00:22:02.485]  But the President's greatest failure is that he has not yet taken action.
[00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:03.186]  He says he will.
[00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:06.347]  He's taking action against the colleges.
[00:22:06.387 --> 00:22:07.108]  That's a clear cut.
[00:22:08.509 --> 00:22:13.373]  Now Texas and other states are taking action.
[00:22:16.796 --> 00:22:18.097]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:21.040]  An amazing time to be alive.
[00:22:24.022 --> 00:22:26.264]  But we have to stand together.
[00:22:29.627 --> 00:22:30.908]  The media made jokes about it.
[00:22:31.588 --> 00:22:33.230]  Late night comedy made jokes about it.
[00:22:35.356 --> 00:22:37.537]  Chick-fil-A, owned by a Christian.
[00:22:38.177 --> 00:22:39.218]  They're closed on Sunday.
[00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:44.980]  They've been boycotted for a decade by the liberals.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.462]  It's made their company become the most successful fast food chain in the country.
[00:22:49.842 --> 00:22:50.523]  Others are failing.
[00:22:54.144 --> 00:22:55.225]  It's funny, it's conservative.
[00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:56.285]  Quick service.
[00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:57.646]  Nice people.
[00:22:58.286 --> 00:22:59.066]  Super professional.
[00:22:59.927 --> 00:23:01.467]  And it's some of the better fast food out there.
[00:23:01.487 --> 00:23:02.828]  One of the only places I'll eat fast food.
[00:23:04.764 --> 00:23:09.946]  Cities like Austin and others were banning it in airports because it's conservative.
[00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:15.587]  Cities were saying, who could be on city property that's really public property?
[00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:26.010]  So the governor had to get a law passed so that Chick-fil-A could pay for a stall at the airport.
[00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:31.732]  When they've got all these empty stalls at the Austin airport, just waiting for renters.
[00:23:32.862 --> 00:23:33.863]  Oh wait, you're Christian?
[00:23:34.724 --> 00:23:36.145]  Oh sorry, you can't have a stall.
[00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:38.647]  Think about how far they've already gone.
[00:23:40.308 --> 00:23:45.653]  But a mom and pop shop don't want to make a cake of two guys holding hands and kissing or whatever.
[00:23:46.914 --> 00:23:49.997]  They take it all the way to the Supreme Court to bully that little group of people.
[00:23:50.257 --> 00:23:51.318]  Quite frankly, I'm a libertarian.
[00:23:52.412 --> 00:23:54.854]  I'd say, yeah, go ahead and bake their cake, but that's a mom-and-pop.
[00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:59.677]  And the Supreme Court said, smaller little mom-and-pop things have a right for the religious things.
[00:23:59.697 --> 00:24:05.861]  But when you get into big, giant institutions and organizations, you can crush an entire belief system.
[00:24:07.202 --> 00:24:14.627]  Christianity's seen persecution of it, according to the UN, double in the last 20 years, and then just in the last five, it's more than doubled again.
[00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:17.368]  That's quadruple.
[00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:19.270]  That's exponential.
[00:24:20.498 --> 00:24:22.459]  It's open season on Christians everywhere.
[00:24:23.219 --> 00:24:36.726]  I saw in my stacks yesterday and today, without even looking for it, without even trying to go search engine it, attacks on churches in the U.S.
[00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:38.067]  and in Europe by Muslims.
[00:24:39.928 --> 00:24:41.649]  Imagine if a Christian attacked a mosque.
[00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:43.530]  It'd be all over the news.
[00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:47.752]  Incredible.
[00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:50.113]  Next level.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.560]  Outrageous.
[00:24:54.601 --> 00:24:57.102]  But that's what's going on.
[00:24:58.243 --> 00:25:03.105]  Yeah, Germany sees 30 anti-Christian attacks in two months alone.
[00:25:03.425 --> 00:25:05.886]  They estimate only 1 out of 10 reports get reported.
[00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:16.250]  And everybody knows about attacks on colleges and dorms against black people and Jews.
[00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.751]  Of course, it's always in the front page of the paper.
[00:25:18.811 --> 00:25:20.251]  It turns out 99% of them are staged.
[00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:23.326]  Yeah.
[00:25:25.426 --> 00:25:28.407]  There's hardly ever anybody really burns a cross in somebody's yard.
[00:25:28.847 --> 00:25:31.527]  There's hardly ever anybody actually puts a swastika on something.
[00:25:32.148 --> 00:25:34.948]  It's done by individuals that want attention and power.
[00:25:35.468 --> 00:25:36.348]  Like Jesse Smollett.
[00:25:37.388 --> 00:25:38.669]  Or the setup of the Covington Kids.
[00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:51.691]  Or, we now confirm that the law firm, the Democratic Party law firm, most powerful on the East Coast, arguably, with a bunch of Obama appointees, former federal prosecutors, provided a transcript to the court
[00:25:53.268 --> 00:25:58.009]  The court took his official, not their own court transcript, saying, I said, Jew boy.
[00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:11.013]  We had two other stenographers look at it and do reports, and they said, white shoe boy, clearer than the sun in the sky at noon.
[00:26:12.773 --> 00:26:15.114]  Think about that mentality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:15.994 --> 00:26:18.215]  We're at every level.
[00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:22.516]  You're dealing with deception.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:32.463]  Focused, cold, sociopathic.
[00:26:35.443 --> 00:26:38.004]  We're gonna go to break and come back with the big enchilada.
[00:26:39.385 --> 00:26:43.886]  This is undoubtedly, to this point, the coup de grace.
[00:26:44.146 --> 00:26:44.986]  The creme de la creme.
[00:26:45.967 --> 00:26:47.467]  This is the paramount point.
[00:26:48.067 --> 00:26:49.148]  I'm sure it's penultimate.
[00:26:49.208 --> 00:26:50.888]  I'm sure there'll be something bigger in the future.
[00:26:51.108 --> 00:26:52.809]  And this will become second only to it.
[00:26:55.089 --> 00:27:03.052]  In the fight for liberty, this broadcast, this audience, this community, these hosts, this crew, is penultimate only to Trump in the fight to restore the Republic.
[00:27:03.532 --> 00:27:03.993]  Think about that.
[00:27:05.853 --> 00:27:10.315]  But we're going to get to the big whopper, the proof.
[00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:21.760]  And if Trump doesn't take action with this, it means they're not following his orders, which has been already admitted, and it just means that he's ready to lose the election in 2020.
[00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:29.165]  That you are going to see the type of penheads that are at the top of Google running your life.
[00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:34.007]  And arrogant, and cold-blooded about the whole thing.
[00:27:35.227 --> 00:27:37.428]  The technocrats that rule your information.
[00:27:38.188 --> 00:27:39.869]  And decide who can say what and when.
[00:27:40.829 --> 00:27:41.470]  It's all coming up.
[00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.270]  We have Clown World.
[00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:47.972]  Wednesday and Thursday night, the two presidential Democrat debates.
[00:27:48.613 --> 00:27:49.513]  We're going to be covering it live.
[00:27:52.574 --> 00:27:54.955]  At InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:55.555 --> 00:27:56.075]  I'll be here.
[00:27:56.155 --> 00:27:58.056]  Owen Schroer will be here and many other guest hosts.
[00:27:58.556 --> 00:27:59.937]  Really looking forward to this broadcast.
[00:27:59.957 --> 00:28:00.897]  We'll go an hour before.
[00:28:01.377 --> 00:28:04.178]  Then I've got a mystery science theater coverage after.
[00:28:04.218 --> 00:28:05.919]  And then take an hour of phone calls after.
[00:28:05.939 --> 00:28:07.080]  It's gonna be big.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.600]  Crew's gonna work their ass off.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.822]  We appreciate you telling everybody you know about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.461]  And we'll have a page up there by tonight.
[00:28:15.941 --> 00:28:23.203]  InfoWars.com forward slash clown as in C-L-O-W-N.
[00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:29.585]  InfoWars.com forward slash clown or InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:32.125]  But Clown World.
[00:28:33.406 --> 00:28:34.086]  Clown World.
[00:28:35.618 --> 00:28:45.204]  Also, don't forget, we're going to have to end the sale on Friday because supplies are running low of these amazing products we have, like the supplements, the air filtration, and that's almost sold at cost.

[00:29:10.626 --> 00:29:13.067]  So here's Lefto, but there's good news!
[00:29:14.608 --> 00:29:21.272]  I don't just come on air, willy-nilly, without something to offer ya!
[00:29:22.033 --> 00:29:26.735]  Not only is Lefto the Clown here live for this segment, but I got good news!
[00:29:26.755 --> 00:29:34.000]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, Lefto the Clown has friends out there in the political community.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.101]  A lot of them are in the government.
[00:29:37.452 --> 00:29:41.973]  And some of them want to be President of the United States!
[00:29:43.473 --> 00:29:44.153]  That's right!
[00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:49.995]  Some of Lefto's buddies are running for President of the United States!
[00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:55.316]  Now I know you're out there probably jumping for joy, but hold your horses!
[00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:59.757]  Because there's even more to be excited about!
[00:30:00.737 --> 00:30:05.218]  Not just that Lefto's friends are running for President, but that next week,
[00:30:07.646 --> 00:30:10.140]  They will be hosting a clown show!
[00:30:11.311 --> 00:30:12.432]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:12.892 --> 00:30:17.796]  Next week, the Democrats are having their first presidential debates.
[00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.218]  And you know what that means.
[00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:24.762]  It's the Clown World Show, the greatest comedy show on earth.
[00:30:25.222 --> 00:30:26.763]  The first Democrat debate.
[00:30:27.444 --> 00:30:31.027]  But ladies and gentlemen, we're so committed to your entertainment.
[00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:34.930]  We're so committed to you getting the full picture.
[00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.732]  We're so committed to the Clown World.
[00:30:38.513 --> 00:30:39.654]  We're gonna shake it up a bit.
[00:30:40.823 --> 00:30:55.978]  Not only do we have one night of presidential Democrat debates, we give you two nights of The Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth, and the best news is yet to come!
[00:30:57.219 --> 00:31:02.344]  It's all gonna be streamed live at infowars.com slash show!
[00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:17.301]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:31:17.401 --> 00:31:18.202]  They are technocrats.
[00:31:18.463 --> 00:31:20.586]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:31:21.186 --> 00:31:28.056]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, it's in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:31:28.957 --> 00:31:30.438]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:31:30.819 --> 00:31:32.960]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:39.706]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:31:39.866 --> 00:31:40.626]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:42.027]  I work a lot of hours.
[00:31:42.588 --> 00:31:47.572]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4WarsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:31:48.212 --> 00:31:57.219]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:03.883]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter you're going to find anywhere.
[00:32:03.983 --> 00:32:07.645]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:11.447]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[00:32:12.087 --> 00:32:13.328]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[00:32:13.988 --> 00:32:16.330]  This is the next level.
[00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.512]  This is Ultra 12.
[00:32:17.932 --> 00:32:23.738]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:23.798 --> 00:32:26.861]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[00:32:27.201 --> 00:32:27.842]  It tastes great.
[00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:29.523]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:30.524]  It is amazing.
[00:32:30.764 --> 00:32:38.452]  Experience pure Methocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[00:32:38.892 --> 00:32:44.474]  At InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:44.694 --> 00:32:53.656]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're gonna find anywhere, and it funds the Info War, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[00:32:53.896 --> 00:32:57.297]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[00:33:06.488 --> 00:33:09.210]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:22.539]  Coming at you live!
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.341]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:25.682 --> 00:33:27.523]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:28.204 --> 00:33:29.605]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:40.059]  50,000!
[00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:40.059]  50,000!
[00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:40.059]  Unstoppable watts!
[00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:41.522]  Woo!
[00:33:41.542 --> 00:33:43.867]  And racks!
[00:33:43.927 --> 00:33:44.729]  And radio!
[00:34:06.027 --> 00:34:08.008]  What if I told you they'd be lying?
[00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.210]  Clutch bringing us in.
[00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:15.872]  Way underrated.
[00:34:15.912 --> 00:34:18.933]  I'm getting old, man.
[00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:24.756]  I'm getting little fat little earlobes like Grandpa.
[00:34:25.336 --> 00:34:27.017]  It's your source of information.
[00:34:28.677 --> 00:34:30.918]  50,000 unstoppable watts.
[00:34:31.218 --> 00:34:34.680]  Hell, I think we got like
[00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.592]  Twelve 50,001 AM stations.
[00:34:37.652 --> 00:34:40.834]  Alright, let's get back to the serious news.
[00:34:43.497 --> 00:34:53.785]  I'm very happy about this, but if we don't do our job, and that means you, and that means I'm on my knees, please realize how much power you've got.
[00:34:53.805 --> 00:35:05.334]  If you get the article at newswars.com and infowars.com, and the live feed at infowars.com and newswars.com, and just email it and text it out and call people and call Talk Radio,
[00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:35.291]  And say, wow, after Google lied to Congress, and after Google told the world that they weren't censoring anybody, and after all the times we caught them in their internal documents and their own admissions, Project Veritas has put out a 25-minute report and hours of raw footage on their site showing Google executives bragging how they censor conservatives and block them, and how they call fairness not letting Trump
[00:35:36.192 --> 00:35:37.793]  Get re-elected or people like him.
[00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:40.836]  Jin Janai.
[00:35:42.797 --> 00:35:44.198]  These are high-level individuals.
[00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:47.241]  And they're SJWs right out of college.
[00:35:48.582 --> 00:35:54.006]  That's where they produce these clones, like something out of Star Wars.
[00:35:54.887 --> 00:35:56.849]  They may look different, but they all have the same worldview.
[00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:02.593]  And they just come out and say, we're not going to let 2020 happen again.
[00:36:02.954 --> 00:36:05.636]  But didn't the head of Google
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.380]  Remember this?
[00:36:07.701 --> 00:36:10.703]  Breitbart.com, Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com hammered it.
[00:36:11.144 --> 00:36:13.386]  September 11, 2018, the documents came out.
[00:36:15.007 --> 00:36:24.215]  From the day after, November 8, 2016, on November 9th, this video went out to Google's leadership.
[00:36:24.675 --> 00:36:25.676]  Thousands of managers.
[00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:27.618]  Somebody was bad and leaked it.
[00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:32.122]  Google's leadership dismayed reaction to Trump, and they promised
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.841]  To not let it happen again.
[00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:41.083]  But hell, internal emails said they were going to deliver the election to Hillary.
[00:36:41.483 --> 00:36:43.603]  Here's just some of the hours of this stuff.
[00:36:43.623 --> 00:36:44.024]  Here it is.
[00:36:45.164 --> 00:36:48.785]  I certainly find this election deeply offensive.
[00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:51.046]  And I imagine you do too.
[00:36:51.186 --> 00:36:54.147]  It did feel like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.
[00:36:54.187 --> 00:36:55.747]  What we all need right now is a hug.
[00:36:55.867 --> 00:36:57.288]  Can I move to Canada?
[00:37:00.258 --> 00:37:02.959]  Is there anything positive you see from this election result?
[00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:09.102]  Boy, that's a really tough one right now.
[00:37:11.263 --> 00:37:14.725]  And they go on to say, we are not going to let this happen again.
[00:37:14.745 --> 00:37:16.105]  We're going to play more video of that in a moment.
[00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:21.328]  If you're a TV viewer, you notice they're wearing propeller hats, dunce hats.
[00:37:22.179 --> 00:37:28.262]  They have beer on the campus and pinball machines, and it's all done as camouflage.
[00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:41.728]  The most criminal parts of DARPA in the globalist, eugenic, stay-behind cult set it up now, 21 years ago, to be an AI takeover of the planet.
[00:37:42.068 --> 00:37:43.269]  It's dealt with China.
[00:37:44.623 --> 00:37:47.825]  And the EU, like, it loves authoritarianism, it hates America.
[00:37:48.126 --> 00:37:49.827]  They say that in their own documents.
[00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:52.188]  They work to arrest political dissidents.
[00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:59.773]  But their own employees dress like clowns and go around, oh, I'm wearing pink and green non-matching socks.
[00:37:59.813 --> 00:38:03.856]  It's all camouflage for their criminal activity.
[00:38:04.256 --> 00:38:07.198]  And the people you see managing Google, that's just front people.
[00:38:07.879 --> 00:38:14.043]  Alphabet with Eric Schmidt and Obama and the Clintons all hover in the darkness.
[00:38:15.657 --> 00:38:18.339]  With the strings down their little puppets.
[00:38:22.662 --> 00:38:25.644]  I thought someday it would be you that would hold the strings.
[00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:30.288]  I don't know, Senator Corleone, President Corleone.
[00:38:30.988 --> 00:38:38.614]  But see, there's something about a handsome man that's built his own company and wearing a nice suit and kills people himself.
[00:38:39.194 --> 00:38:39.995]  That's scary.
[00:38:40.035 --> 00:38:41.776]  People know he could be the bad guy.
[00:38:43.152 --> 00:38:46.193]  See, Google wears a propeller hat on their head.
[00:38:47.073 --> 00:38:48.854]  Doesn't matter they got a trillion dollars.
[00:38:48.934 --> 00:38:50.774]  Doesn't matter they watch everything you do.
[00:38:51.335 --> 00:38:57.717]  Doesn't matter they sell it all to the Chinese and the Chinese put two million of their own people in concentration camps using Google.
[00:38:59.117 --> 00:38:59.837]  Doesn't matter.
[00:39:01.678 --> 00:39:05.259]  Hell, if Hitler wore a propeller hat, we probably would have let him win.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.740]  See how it works?
[00:39:09.338 --> 00:39:12.661]  That's why child molesters dress up like clowns or girls.
[00:39:13.581 --> 00:39:16.203]  They learn they can get your kid in the back of the car that way.
[00:39:16.223 --> 00:39:18.485]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:39:21.908 --> 00:39:25.971]  So I'm not doing a very good Don Corleone anyway, so I was kind of segwaying off into a Goodfellas.
[00:39:28.913 --> 00:39:30.934]  And you know this Salazzo business, huh?
[00:39:31.715 --> 00:39:35.458]  When they call for a meeting, it'll be at that meeting you'll be assassinated.
[00:39:37.142 --> 00:39:39.182]  Did you check the phone lines again?
[00:39:39.663 --> 00:39:40.103]  Check that.
[00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:41.723]  I checked it all, Pops.
[00:39:42.243 --> 00:39:42.703]  Good stuff.
[00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:48.004]  The point is, is that we know Mafia when it's looking at us right in the eyes.
[00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:50.165]  And we're not stupid.
[00:39:52.145 --> 00:39:54.326]  And so here's the big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.426]  Project Veritas champion.
[00:39:58.286 --> 00:39:58.826]  Hero.
[00:39:59.447 --> 00:40:01.027]  All-around badass.
[00:40:01.487 --> 00:40:03.387]  See, I don't admire Michael Jordan.
[00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.128]  Very entertaining to watch.
[00:40:05.288 --> 00:40:06.048]  Amazing athlete.
[00:40:07.654 --> 00:40:11.795]  Put it this way, I admire Michael Jordan, but on a scale of 1 to 10, Michael Jordan's like a 2.
[00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:14.356]  Project Veritas is like a 9.
[00:40:15.937 --> 00:40:16.437]  Trump's like a 9.
[00:40:18.798 --> 00:40:23.199]  Firefighter that goes in a house, he knows it's collapsing to get kids out, gets burned to death, that guy's a 10.
[00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:32.622]  Somebody in a hostage situation goes in to take out a jihadi, takes him out, he detonates a suicide vest, kills him, that's a 10.
[00:40:34.083 --> 00:40:34.703]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:40:36.448 --> 00:40:37.949]  Roger Staubach said two.
[00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.891]  Roger Staubach would tell you that too, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:44.532 --> 00:40:46.173]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[00:40:46.253 --> 00:40:55.118]  I literally get butterflies when somebody like Matt Drudge shows up in our offices or I got a Project Veritas James O'Keefe on.
[00:40:55.498 --> 00:40:55.998]  Because you know what?
[00:40:56.258 --> 00:40:59.000]  That's the person saving my children's future.
[00:41:00.302 --> 00:41:03.244]  That's somebody they've tried to indict six or seven times.
[00:41:03.845 --> 00:41:04.886]  Hell, they did indict him once.
[00:41:05.386 --> 00:41:06.867]  That's somebody they're trying to put in prison!
[00:41:07.288 --> 00:41:08.409]  Somebody they're trying to kill!
[00:41:08.429 --> 00:41:12.392]  And I know for a fact he's going through the same stuff I go through behind the scenes!
[00:41:13.673 --> 00:41:14.774]  Those are real men!
[00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:21.553]  And everybody else gets threatened with being taken off the air or blacklisted when they come on our show.
[00:41:21.573 --> 00:41:28.058]  And all these other good time pals that always wanted on the show, as soon as we got blacklisted, they won't even talk to us!
[00:41:28.078 --> 00:41:30.580]  And it doesn't hurt my feelings, they won't talk to me.
[00:41:30.841 --> 00:41:33.043]  It hurts my feelings to know they're not men!
[00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:34.984]  They're not even little boys!
[00:41:35.585 --> 00:41:37.406]  They're fakes that want to play both sides.
[00:41:38.447 --> 00:41:41.910]  When you try to play both sides of something like this, you lose the whole civilization.
[00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:44.913]  So we come back.
[00:41:47.699 --> 00:42:06.329]  I'm going to get to the boil-down of the 25-minute video that O'Keefe's going to be on, and then I'm going to air the entire investigative report after that, and then Gerald Cilente, another great patriot that I admire, is going to be taking over the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.150]  I admire people like David Knight.
[00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:14.433]  He had a huge heart attack, almost died, and a week after he had surgery,
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:25.127]  He came down here and tried to do a show until he almost passed out, countermanding my orders that he take off two months because he was upset about what was happening in the country.
[00:42:26.468 --> 00:42:27.689]  That's what made this country great.
[00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.754]  Not a bunch of damn wanting to be on TV just to be on TV or walk some red carpet.
[00:42:33.774 --> 00:42:35.996]  You couldn't pay me to walk a red carpet.
[00:42:36.677 --> 00:42:38.698]  You know in Hollywood, walking the red carpet's a joke.
[00:42:38.738 --> 00:42:39.339]  They all hate it.
[00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.391]  They'll know it's all about food on the general public that somehow they're on some higher level than you.
[00:42:46.152 --> 00:42:47.392]  They are on a higher level.
[00:42:47.672 --> 00:42:50.133]  A higher level of bathing in crap.
[00:42:52.493 --> 00:42:54.774]  All these Google slaves are going down.
[00:42:55.694 --> 00:42:56.695]  They're not gonna beat us.
[00:42:57.535 --> 00:42:59.655]  So keep running your arrogant fat mouths.
[00:43:00.296 --> 00:43:01.436]  We're gonna play it when we come back.
[00:43:03.497 --> 00:43:04.577]  The time has come.
[00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:06.037]  The time is now.
[00:43:07.158 --> 00:43:08.278]  To put the cards on the table.
[00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:16.336]  What would happen, ask yourselves, if InfoWars is taken off the air?
[00:43:18.378 --> 00:43:19.519]  Ask yourself another question.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.440]  It's even more important.
[00:43:22.841 --> 00:43:26.464]  What would have happened if InfoWars was never on air?
[00:43:28.065 --> 00:43:37.313]  The tens of thousands of interviews, the investigative reports, the documentary films, the rallies, the tens of billions of views,
[00:43:38.402 --> 00:43:41.624]  On YouTube and Facebook and other platforms, what would have happened?
[00:43:43.605 --> 00:43:47.587]  You wouldn't have a global revolution right now against the globalists.
[00:43:48.687 --> 00:43:50.788]  You wouldn't have a global revolution against tyranny.
[00:43:51.249 --> 00:44:00.213]  You wouldn't have populist and nationalist and pro-Christian and pro-family candidates winning all over the world if Infowars hadn't been here.
[00:44:01.154 --> 00:44:05.416]  Now, that's not me up here flexing, saying, you're lucky I'm here.
[00:44:05.556 --> 00:44:05.756]  No.
[00:44:06.797 --> 00:44:07.357]  It's the opposite.
[00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:17.860]  Whether you live in a little log cabin or a trailer, whether you live in a big fancy mansion, you've got a connection to God and justice.
[00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:29.047]  And those of you that have spread the word and prayed for us and financially supported the broadcast, getting great products at the same time, you built this house.
[00:44:30.408 --> 00:44:31.589]  What's that movie about baseball?
[00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.190]  If you build it, they will come?
[00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:36.271]  Robert Redford's in it.
[00:44:36.351 --> 00:44:37.072]  Is it the natural?
[00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:39.090]  Feel the dreams?
[00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:40.051]  I mean, I don't remember.
[00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:41.292]  Feel the dreams?
[00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.774]  We built this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:47.035]  And you came.
[00:44:48.977 --> 00:44:49.517]  We built it.
[00:44:50.097 --> 00:44:50.618]  And we did it.
[00:44:51.258 --> 00:44:59.483]  And now, they're pissed because they don't want this golden goose with its big ol' fat juicy booty to lay any more of those golden eggs.
[00:45:00.104 --> 00:45:01.565]  And that's really what this comes down to.
[00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:03.146]  It's a sexy goose.
[00:45:04.136 --> 00:45:05.017]  It's a pretty goose.
[00:45:05.678 --> 00:45:06.578]  It's a sweet goose.
[00:45:07.019 --> 00:45:10.882]  It's a goose that likes you and likes me and likes our children.
[00:45:11.443 --> 00:45:17.588]  And you know, I can joke around about this all day, but getting serious, ladies and gentlemen, they're coming on at us like a freight train.
[00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:24.415]  And this isn't some spectator sport where you watch us in the arena get chewed up or be victorious.
[00:45:25.175 --> 00:45:28.659]  This is a real world action, a war.
[00:45:30.097 --> 00:45:34.880]  Where your action and the support you give us, or don't, governs everything.
[00:45:35.241 --> 00:45:40.084]  This isn't Netflix dramas, or HBO dramas, or Godzilla fighting the three-headed dragon.
[00:45:40.444 --> 00:45:41.705]  This isn't theater.
[00:45:41.966 --> 00:45:43.327]  This isn't imaginary world.
[00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:48.330]  This is rubber meets the road, planet Earth, the middle of 2019.
[00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:57.197]  So I've thought for a long time about when it was time, what the demarcation line was.
[00:45:58.097 --> 00:45:58.858]  The point of no return.
[00:46:00.387 --> 00:46:02.949]  Instead of just saying, hey, we're not going to be here unless you support us.
[00:46:04.131 --> 00:46:05.552]  But what is the point to tell people?
[00:46:05.572 --> 00:46:09.055]  Because it makes the enemy happy, and we don't want to make them happy.
[00:46:09.095 --> 00:46:15.001]  But we need to also be honest with you to say, we're bleeding to death.
[00:46:16.422 --> 00:46:18.504]  We've put up an incredible fight, and I'm proud of what we've done.
[00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:42.522]  It takes millions of dollars to run our own servers, and stream to millions a day, and to run all the IT, and to pay for all the equipment, and to have the legal and to do this, and you've done an amazing job, but if you do not commit to get our great products, and commit to sign up for AutoShip, and commit every month when you can, if you can't understand, to get products that are already the best.
[00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:46.404]  Air filtration, water filtration, all these things you and your family need.
[00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:47.685]  If you don't commit,
[00:46:48.536 --> 00:46:53.619]  Enemy will win, and they will smash InfoWars, and we will sink into the sea.
[00:46:54.419 --> 00:46:56.500]  Help us fight on in the future, because this is the ship.
[00:46:57.461 --> 00:46:58.861]  This is the ship you built.
[00:46:59.722 --> 00:47:00.662]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:01.183 --> 00:47:01.843]  I'm in your hands.
[00:47:06.445 --> 00:47:09.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:38.897]  Good ol' Jen Genni and others at Google are in a detailed Project Veritas dot com report.
[00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:42.780]  We've got served up for ya at NewsWars dot com.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.561]  Please get it.
[00:47:43.581 --> 00:47:45.422]  And send it to everybody you know.
[00:47:45.942 --> 00:47:46.243]  Watch.
[00:47:46.783 --> 00:47:50.506]  Google admits they're going to steal the election from Trump in 2020.
[00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:52.167]  They are arrogant about it.
[00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:54.009]  Just like college professors.
[00:47:55.404 --> 00:48:00.948]  When they say there is no free speech on this campus, there will be no pro-Trump speakers, there will be no Republican speakers.
[00:48:00.988 --> 00:48:03.229]  This is their just conceitedness.
[00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.113]  Their arrogance will be their undoing unless we aren't active.
[00:48:09.514 --> 00:48:12.296]  So we're very close to the antitrust suits that are about to be filed.
[00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:13.516]  We need injunctions.
[00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:16.158]  We need the FBI to raid Google.
[00:48:16.218 --> 00:48:17.439]  And by the way, that's being talked about.
[00:48:20.161 --> 00:48:22.843]  Just for their espionage.
[00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:26.230]  What about their lying to Congress, all their executives?
[00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:27.651]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:35.034]  But the Heritage Foundation and the Koch brothers, funding the Republican Party establishment, go, Oh, private companies can do anything they want!
[00:48:36.995 --> 00:48:37.955]  Oh, sure, right.
[00:48:39.336 --> 00:48:41.997]  Yeah, Google could have 93% of the searches in the U.S.
[00:48:42.057 --> 00:48:45.039]  and put up searches saying that the official
[00:48:46.007 --> 00:48:51.360]  The party affiliation of Trump is Adolf Hitler, and the Republicans are in the Nazi party.
[00:48:51.541 --> 00:48:55.049]  When you just go to vote or look stuff up, it says, oh, their affiliation's Nazis.
[00:48:58.971 --> 00:49:00.632]  Just like they said last Monday.
[00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.392]  Hundreds of newspapers everywhere.
[00:49:02.412 --> 00:49:05.273]  National News, Alex Jones sent child porn to the San Diego parents.
[00:49:05.553 --> 00:49:07.194]  The FBI sent us a letter saying it's not true.
[00:49:07.214 --> 00:49:07.714]  We're the victim.
[00:49:07.974 --> 00:49:09.955]  Somebody sent it to us after we got sued.
[00:49:10.495 --> 00:49:11.195]  Was unopened.
[00:49:11.456 --> 00:49:13.256]  But they subpoenaed those emails.
[00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:14.136]  They got them.
[00:49:14.156 --> 00:49:14.136]  $57,000.
[00:49:15.977 --> 00:49:17.538]  Well, you should have read everyone.
[00:49:17.658 --> 00:49:18.338]  Read everyone!
[00:49:18.398 --> 00:49:19.418]  It was hidden links!
[00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:21.059]  They had to scan it!
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.061]  Look at these blast points.
[00:49:27.042 --> 00:49:28.903]  I've just never seen sand people hit something this big.
[00:49:29.564 --> 00:49:30.444]  That's because they didn't.
[00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:32.085]  We were made to think they did.
[00:49:32.526 --> 00:49:34.847]  Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise!
[00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:39.750]  Alright, I'm going to quit doing the Godfather and Star Wars quotes today.
[00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:43.513]  FBI confirms InfoWars is the victim of a child porn attack.
[00:49:43.833 --> 00:49:46.355]  InfoWars.com, read the FBI letter.
[00:49:47.315 --> 00:49:49.297]  Confirming they already told Pattis that last week.
[00:49:49.497 --> 00:49:50.658]  Confirming their new conversation.
[00:49:50.698 --> 00:49:51.638]  They called him again Friday.
[00:49:51.878 --> 00:49:52.719]  Were very cordial.
[00:49:53.139 --> 00:49:54.560]  And said, yes, you guys are the victims.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.741]  Please destroy it all.
[00:49:58.149 --> 00:50:02.970]  And, boy, if we ever get subpoenaed again by a judge asking for tens of thousands of emails, we're going to explain.
[00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:08.052]  Your Honor, it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to send these to firms to scan them for hidden links.
[00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:12.333]  And we're going to make the opposition pay.
[00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:16.294]  And then you can scan till the cows come home.
[00:50:16.374 --> 00:50:18.395]  But let's get to the video I mentioned.
[00:50:18.595 --> 00:50:26.577]  Insider blows whistle as execs reveal Google plan to prevent Trump situation in 2020 on hidden camera.
[00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:34.446]  And this is Machine Learning Fairness and Google Practices Head.
[00:50:36.148 --> 00:50:39.230]  The former Fair and Equitable Program is now called Machine Learning Fairness.
[00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:44.955]  Now a machine calls it fair when Trump loses and when they game the system like Google's brag.
[00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:53.822]  But because they call it fair, when you call a man a woman, that's happening all over the world.
[00:50:53.862 --> 00:50:55.103]  They're filing suits and winning.
[00:50:55.463 --> 00:50:56.404]  Men come in to have
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:50:59.840]  Don't worry.
[00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:22.842]  And then usually the bizarre drugged out meth head says, stick your fingers in you know where, and the women do it.
[00:51:23.202 --> 00:51:26.765]  They submit to being raped because it's a God in front of them.
[00:51:27.225 --> 00:51:31.148]  And mothers bring their little kids to sit on the laps of convicted pedophiles all over the country.
[00:51:31.168 --> 00:51:31.829]  It's all confirmed.
[00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:34.450]  We've named the names, shown you the convictions of rapists.
[00:51:34.631 --> 00:51:39.254]  And the mothers bring them like to bail, like a human sacrifice, and set them on the laps.
[00:51:42.796 --> 00:51:45.538]  It's all about your submission to evil.
[00:51:45.558 --> 00:51:47.780]  Because if you'll put up with that,
[00:51:48.857 --> 00:52:02.969]  If nurses are made to give men cervical exams, and now they want taxpayers to pay for dogs' sex changes and cats' sex changes, they're coming to take me away.
[00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:04.410]  Ha-ha-ho-hee-ha-ha!
[00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:06.852]  Except, it's the globalists.
[00:52:07.252 --> 00:52:08.893]  They're making us submit to madness.
[00:52:09.254 --> 00:52:10.495]  We're the ones that are crazy.
[00:52:11.075 --> 00:52:11.736]  Well, not me.
[00:52:12.356 --> 00:52:14.578]  So here's just some of the Project Veritas boil-down.
[00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:16.320]  Again, James O'Keefe coming up in the third hour.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:16.640]  Here it is.
[00:52:17.967 --> 00:52:25.213]  The reason why I decided to come to Project Veritas is because people need to know what's actually going on with Google.
[00:52:25.273 --> 00:52:27.695]  There's this fraud about what they're doing.
[00:52:28.155 --> 00:52:32.779]  But what they're actually doing, what the employees are actually seeing inside the company, is different.
[00:52:32.799 --> 00:52:37.302]  The reason we launched our AI principles was because people were not putting that line in the sand.
[00:52:37.322 --> 00:52:38.703]  They were not saying... Back this up.
[00:52:38.763 --> 00:52:40.805]  Let's go to the start again.
[00:52:40.845 --> 00:52:41.706]  She's the head.
[00:52:42.737 --> 00:52:45.138]  Of responsible innovation.
[00:52:45.938 --> 00:52:47.318]  We're innovating things.
[00:52:47.738 --> 00:52:49.219]  What did the head of Apple say?
[00:52:49.919 --> 00:52:53.400]  They asked him, why did you ban Alex Jones completely off everything and even ban his top app?
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.100]  It was number one.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.041]  The people voted it number one news app by downloading it.
[00:52:57.101 --> 00:52:57.581]  Number one.
[00:52:58.201 --> 00:52:59.941]  Ahead of the Wall Street Journal, Fox News.
[00:53:00.242 --> 00:53:01.782]  They were number one!
[00:53:05.719 --> 00:53:08.160]  Oh, he's a horrible person, I told you.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.921]  Well, like a curator in a museum.
[00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.681]  And because I'm gay, it's okay, alright?
[00:53:14.862 --> 00:53:20.903]  Yes, I run death camps in China, the worst factories, with suicide nets, but I'm... I'm gay.
[00:53:21.884 --> 00:53:26.045]  I'm like, dude, I don't care what you do with your ding-a-ling, Tim Cook.
[00:53:26.285 --> 00:53:29.266]  So I've been told folks, knowing him, he is major pissed at me talking about that.
[00:53:29.546 --> 00:53:33.147]  I'm just saying, running death camps, you don't get a pass because you're gay.
[00:53:35.748 --> 00:53:37.629]  By the way, what the hell are you on, bro?
[00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:42.333]  There's all these video interviews with him under bright lights with 90% pupil.
[00:53:42.813 --> 00:53:46.396]  I mean, I've taken three hits of acid and my eyes didn't get that big, you know?
[00:53:46.736 --> 00:53:47.617]  I'm joking, I never did that.
[00:53:48.377 --> 00:53:50.619]  I took mushrooms with the acid with the... I'm joking!
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.882]  The point is, I have never seen anybody's eyeballs that big.
[00:53:56.067 --> 00:54:00.131]  They're pupils, so... Whatever he's on doesn't look too healthy, does he?
[00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:01.512]  But it's okay!
[00:54:01.532 --> 00:54:13.323]  I have a trillion dollar company, and it costs $20 to make the phone, and even the Communist Party said if you'd pay people a dollar a day more, they wouldn't have to live on the street working for you, and he just said, oh my gosh!
[00:54:13.704 --> 00:54:14.885]  Did you know I'm gay?
[00:54:14.905 --> 00:54:16.847]  It's like, it's okay!
[00:54:18.226 --> 00:54:18.887]  It's okay.
[00:54:19.387 --> 00:54:22.870]  He went to China two years ago and he said, I want to censor everybody.
[00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:24.211]  I support governments doing it.
[00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:25.792]  That was a major headline.
[00:54:26.873 --> 00:54:30.216]  But, again, he's gay.
[00:54:31.297 --> 00:54:33.338]  As long as a gay person does it, it's liberal.
[00:54:33.678 --> 00:54:35.060]  Oh my gosh, how sweet!
[00:54:37.822 --> 00:54:38.743]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[00:54:40.183 --> 00:54:42.545]  And, uh, go back to the report, sorry.
[00:54:42.585 --> 00:54:49.270]  So this is the headlady, just cold-bloodedly, and notice she says, it doesn't matter what Congress tries, we're not gonna stop.
[00:54:54.134 --> 00:54:56.055]  You'll never stop me, Superman!
[00:54:58.177 --> 00:54:58.497]  Here it is.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:06.281]  The reason why I decided to come to Project Veritas is because people need to know what's actually going on.
[00:55:06.341 --> 00:55:09.362]  With Google, there's this fraud about what they're doing.
[00:55:09.822 --> 00:55:14.423]  But what they're actually doing, what the employees are actually seeing inside the company, is different.
[00:55:14.443 --> 00:55:18.943]  The reason we launched our AI principles is because people were not putting a line in the sand.
[00:55:18.963 --> 00:55:21.164]  They were not saying, well, it's fair, it's ethical.
[00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:24.344]  So we're like, well, we are a big company, we're going to say it.
[00:55:24.384 --> 00:55:27.545]  People voted for the current president, but do not agree
[00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:30.802]  They're not an objective piece.
[00:55:30.822 --> 00:55:33.325]  They're not an objective source of information.
[00:55:33.345 --> 00:55:38.609]  But then there are things, you know, which are called ML Fairness.
[00:55:38.929 --> 00:55:39.950]  ML Fairness, it seems.
[00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:42.632]  Fairness, like, you know, you need to be fair.
[00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:43.353]  Hey, pause again!
[00:55:43.433 --> 00:55:48.457]  We're gonna come back with more of this, but... Algorithmic unfairness!
[00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:51.420]  Their ideas are dominating!
[00:55:52.878 --> 00:55:56.440]  They have scientists on saying there's only men and women, and that's not fair!
[00:55:56.741 --> 00:55:57.781]  So they're banned!
[00:56:01.704 --> 00:56:05.707]  Meanwhile, they've totally sold out the CHICOMs that execute you if you're homosexual.
[00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.591]  But it's okay, because Tim Cook's gay!
[00:56:08.991 --> 00:56:14.875]  We're gonna come back with all of that, and we have Congressman Josh Hawley, former Attorney General, Missouri.
[00:56:15.315 --> 00:56:15.876]  Awesome guy.
[00:56:15.896 --> 00:56:21.519]  He has introduced the bills that will strip him of Section 230, if they don't stop what they're doing right now.
[00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:24.842]  So, more power to you!
[00:56:25.242 --> 00:56:26.182]  Full steam ahead!
[00:56:27.163 --> 00:56:28.324]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:56:29.258 --> 00:56:32.641]  You understand there's 25 minutes of this in the boil down.
[00:56:33.021 --> 00:56:35.724]  You just heard 60 seconds.
[00:56:36.144 --> 00:56:37.045]  It gets worse.
[00:56:37.466 --> 00:56:38.306]  It gets worse.
[00:56:38.727 --> 00:56:39.507]  It gets worse.
[00:56:40.989 --> 00:56:42.991]  They say Congress may think they're going to stop us.
[00:56:46.954 --> 00:56:50.618]  So we're going to get into all of it.
[00:56:51.078 --> 00:56:54.862]  Algorithmic unfairness means unjust or pre
[00:56:56.564 --> 00:57:00.790]  Judicial treatment of people that is related to sensitive characteristics.
[00:57:01.891 --> 00:57:04.735]  They can apply that to anything they want, anytime.
[00:57:04.815 --> 00:57:09.422]  Balambline, you will submit, you will assimilate, and by the way, your children are ours.
[00:57:10.263 --> 00:57:10.864]  Now bring them!
[00:57:12.337 --> 00:57:13.778]  We're coming out with our own currencies.
[00:57:14.299 --> 00:57:15.419]  That'll be the new world currencies.
[00:57:15.439 --> 00:57:18.722]  And if you don't behave and give us your children, you won't buy or sell!
[00:57:18.922 --> 00:57:19.902]  So give us your children!
[00:57:19.923 --> 00:57:22.464]  We're really nice people dressed like clowns!
[00:57:22.945 --> 00:57:23.605]  Give them to us!
[00:57:24.426 --> 00:57:27.228]  That's their priest class, is pedos and clown outfits.
[00:57:28.308 --> 00:57:30.470]  Yeah, you don't think Stephen King just came up with that, do you?
[00:57:31.731 --> 00:57:33.372]  Come on over here, Georgie.
[00:57:34.838 --> 00:57:37.421]  Well, behind the scenes, they're not wearing helicopter hats.
[00:57:37.982 --> 00:57:38.543]  Oh, no, no.
[00:57:39.023 --> 00:57:41.126]  They're vicious and hardcore.
[00:57:41.686 --> 00:57:43.829]  Their camouflage is fat men in high heels.
[00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:49.456]  Behind the scenes, it's pure hardcore Satanism, torture, and death.
[00:57:52.682 --> 00:57:58.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on earth, Clown World.
[00:58:00.085 --> 00:58:07.967]  20 socialist, globalist, communist candidates, all in one spot for two nights only.
[00:58:08.388 --> 00:58:13.950]  And you're going to have uncensored, unbridled, pure analysis like no one else can do it.
[00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:20.512]  Clown World, the greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[00:58:21.152 --> 00:58:22.894]  June 26th and 27th.
[00:58:22.934 --> 00:58:25.236]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[00:58:25.717 --> 00:58:28.780]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.882]  It's the greatest show on earth.
[00:58:31.363 --> 00:58:36.808]  A bunch of parasites, bitching and complaining, working for the Chi-Coms to overthrow America.
[00:58:37.269 --> 00:58:44.095]  Join us next Wednesday and Thursday for Clown World, the biggest show on earth!
[00:58:44.836 --> 00:58:45.897]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[00:58:46.257 --> 00:58:46.777]  I'm P.T.
[00:58:46.817 --> 00:58:47.157]  Barnum.
[00:58:47.518 --> 00:58:48.418]  I love the Democrats.
[00:58:48.438 --> 00:58:54.101]  Beto O'Rourke says the world's ending in 11 years and the borders should be open.
[00:58:54.361 --> 00:58:55.662]  There's so many other clowns.
[00:58:55.962 --> 00:59:01.725]  Cory Booker says pay reparations even if 98% of whites didn't have ancestors that owned slaves.
[00:59:02.146 --> 00:59:04.547]  And then we move on to Pocahontas.
[00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:08.129]  She's whiter than anybody ever known in history, but it's okay.
[00:59:08.149 --> 00:59:08.889]  She's a fraud.
[00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:10.170]  And then Joe Biden.
[00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:13.252]  Well, Joe Biden loves segregationists and
[00:59:13.712 --> 00:59:14.752]  It's the greatest show on earth.
[00:59:14.792 --> 00:59:15.473]  Join us this next Wednesday.
[00:59:43.183 --> 00:59:45.685]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:06.192 --> 01:00:07.353]  You have the power.
[01:00:07.694 --> 01:00:09.236]  Humanity has the power.
[01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:10.798]  We have the power.
[01:00:10.818 --> 01:00:11.899]  Do you want to fight?
[01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:14.222]  You better believe you got one!
[01:00:16.505 --> 01:00:20.970]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:21.571 --> 01:00:23.013]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:28.622]  So if you're a radio listener and listening on AM, you can make this out.
[01:00:29.902 --> 01:00:31.463]  But some of the audio goes up and down.
[01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:32.303]  It's just hidden audio.
[01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:33.943]  I'd give it an A+, though, for effort.
[01:00:34.684 --> 01:00:40.105]  But when you get into the raw footage, and it's not the intro to the video, and it doesn't have the music over it, it's even more powerful.
[01:00:40.765 --> 01:00:42.746]  So I'll try to shut up and air the intro to this.
[01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:49.276]  And then come back and get more into the other news, and James O'Keefe joins us next hour, but it's a maximum action alert.
[01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:53.457]  The article's on InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:00:53.677 --> 01:00:54.937]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:00:56.158 --> 01:00:57.578]  This should be the top story in the world.
[01:00:57.638 --> 01:00:59.899]  Google caught red-handed.
[01:00:59.979 --> 01:01:04.360]  Google execs admit they're stealing the election from 2020, from Trump.
[01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:07.921]  Google execs admit election meddling to prevent Trump winning 2020.
[01:01:09.722 --> 01:01:13.423]  Paul Joseph Watson brags Congress can pressure us, but we're not changing.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:23.949]  Again, they hate this country so much, they would give AI, given to them by DARPA, to the chi-coms under Obama's orders.
[01:01:24.749 --> 01:01:25.690]  It's high treason, folks.
[01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:28.353]  And that's why they had no respect for us.
[01:01:28.834 --> 01:01:32.838]  And we finally get a president trying to do a little something, and they're crapping bricks.
[01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:35.701]  They can build a giant brick building with the amount of it.
[01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:37.703]  So they're doubling down on their fear.
[01:01:40.017 --> 01:01:44.658]  More leaks are coming, ladies and gentlemen, but if they steal 2020, it's just going to be unbelievable.
[01:01:44.698 --> 01:01:45.798]  I haven't even gotten to half of it.
[01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:47.918]  They're harassing Tucker Carlson at his house.
[01:01:48.158 --> 01:01:49.759]  I got inside baseball on that.
[01:01:51.899 --> 01:01:54.540]  And it's just outrageous what they're doing to Tucker's family.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.100]  You know, I get sent child porn.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.680]  They come to Tucker Carlson's house.
[01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:01.181]  And again, we're not victims.
[01:02:01.201 --> 01:02:02.021]  We're victorious.
[01:02:02.401 --> 01:02:03.441]  It's why they're doing this to us.
[01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:08.102]  But let me tell you, if there's a sinner in the universe that's evil, it's called the Democratic Party.
[01:02:11.223 --> 01:02:13.511]  So let's go ahead and go back to this Project Veritas page.
[01:02:14.468 --> 01:02:21.833]  The reason why I decided to come to Project Veritas is because people need to know what's actually going on with Google.
[01:02:21.913 --> 01:02:29.378]  There's this facade about what they're doing, but what they're actually doing, what the employees are actually seeing inside the company, is different.
[01:02:29.398 --> 01:02:34.041]  But the reason we launched our AI principles is because people were not putting that line in the sand.
[01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:36.203]  They were not saying it's fair and effective.
[01:02:36.263 --> 01:02:39.345]  So we're like, well, we are a big company, we're going to say it.
[01:02:39.385 --> 01:02:42.787]  People voted for the current president, do not agree
[01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:45.745]  They're not an objective piece.
[01:02:46.265 --> 01:02:48.247]  They're not an objective source of information.
[01:03:02.976 --> 01:03:13.143]  They are a highly biased political machine that is bent on never letting somebody like Donald Trump come to power again.
[01:03:13.403 --> 01:03:14.664]  This is a Goliath I invented.
[01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:28.157]  I'm trying to say that the Emperor has no clothes.
[01:03:34.863 --> 01:03:38.667]  Being a small little ant, I can be crushed and I'm aware of that.
[01:03:39.268 --> 01:03:41.330]  But this is something that is bigger than me.
[01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.814]  This is something that needs to be said to the American public.
[01:03:46.803 --> 01:03:47.404]  I don't know.
[01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.764]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the face of authoritarianism.
[01:04:08.365 --> 01:04:23.040]  Little chicken necks, little control freaks giggling and laughing, lying to Congress, stealing all your data, the company heads making hundreds of billions, working with authoritarians, rounding up political opposition all over the world.
[01:04:24.087 --> 01:04:43.568]  But then manned by a bunch of recently graduated scum out of these evil, anti-free speech, un-American cancers that masquerade as higher learning centers known as universities that are really just globalist porta-potties where they crap on us.
[01:04:45.072 --> 01:04:45.653]  Nightmares.
[01:04:46.514 --> 01:04:47.576]  Divorce from America.
[01:04:47.616 --> 01:04:48.797]  Divorce from common sense.
[01:04:49.058 --> 01:04:50.099]  Divorce from chivalry.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.723]  Divorce from anything decent.
[01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:54.545]  They are the new authoritarians.
[01:04:54.585 --> 01:04:55.186]  They are the enemy.
[01:04:55.547 --> 01:04:56.208]  They are the threat.
[01:04:56.508 --> 01:04:57.590]  And they are our rulers.
[01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.032]  We must overthrow them.
[01:05:08.776 --> 01:05:11.679]  Announcing the greatest show on earth!
[01:05:12.039 --> 01:05:17.184]  Reparations, free healthcare, free college, free homes, free money forever!
[01:05:17.425 --> 01:05:18.265]  Yay!
[01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:20.788]  It's Cloud World 2019!
[01:05:21.068 --> 01:05:26.413]  The Democratic Party's two-night extravaganza debate!
[01:05:26.694 --> 01:05:28.415]  Let's meet the candidates!
[01:05:29.136 --> 01:05:29.917]  All-Star!
[01:05:30.057 --> 01:05:30.978]  Beto O'Rourke!
[01:05:31.699 --> 01:05:32.439]  Oh my gosh!
[01:05:32.519 --> 01:05:33.580]  Cory Booker!
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.162]  The Amazing!
[01:05:35.442 --> 01:05:35.622]  Oh!
[01:05:35.722 --> 01:05:37.063]  Pocahontas!
[01:05:37.644 --> 01:05:39.005]  Joe Biden!

[01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.350]  Bernie Sanders!
[01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:46.712]  Love the Soviet Union!
[01:05:46.732 --> 01:05:47.473]  Kamala Harris!
[01:05:47.493 --> 01:05:48.954]  And so many more!
[01:05:49.414 --> 01:05:50.756]  It's the greatest show on Earth!
[01:05:51.136 --> 01:05:54.879]  Head at fullwars.com forward slash show with live coverage next week!
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:07.208]  Wednesday and Thursday nights.
[01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:08.288]  Right now!
[01:06:08.929 --> 01:06:14.312]  I'm standing up against those that are destroying this country as we speak!
[01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:15.953]  And why am I fired up?
[01:06:16.153 --> 01:06:17.394]  Because this is war!
[01:06:17.734 --> 01:06:21.437]  Absolute, unabated, total war against our nation!
[01:06:22.822 --> 01:06:23.683]  We bring life.
[01:06:23.983 --> 01:06:24.823]  We bring death.
[01:06:25.123 --> 01:06:25.964]  We are men.
[01:06:26.044 --> 01:06:26.804]  We are women.
[01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:27.905]  We are the humans.
[01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:29.006]  We are the planet.
[01:06:29.226 --> 01:06:30.466]  We are God's creation.
[01:06:30.627 --> 01:06:31.587]  We are the future.
[01:06:31.607 --> 01:06:32.368]  Not you!
[01:06:33.068 --> 01:06:34.329]  Death!
[01:06:34.409 --> 01:06:35.069]  Death!
[01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:38.891]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:39.151 --> 01:06:40.432]  We don't fear death!
[01:06:40.952 --> 01:06:45.055]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:46.348 --> 01:06:54.175]  Stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.501]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:07:18.661 --> 01:07:20.922]  Death!
[01:07:21.182 --> 01:07:24.763]  Alright, here I go.
[01:07:24.963 --> 01:07:27.804]  Alright, here I go.
[01:07:29.864 --> 01:07:32.105]  Death!
[01:07:33.605 --> 01:07:34.886]  Good.
[01:07:34.946 --> 01:07:36.306]  Death destroys evil.
[01:07:37.206 --> 01:07:37.987]  And the good alike.
[01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:41.007]  Death is what evil fears.
[01:07:41.107 --> 01:07:42.988]  That's why it masquerades as if it is death.
[01:07:43.914 --> 01:07:44.354]  No.
[01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:47.337]  Death is the great equalizer.
[01:07:48.258 --> 01:07:52.362]  Both high and low, both good and bad, both free and bond.
[01:07:54.383 --> 01:07:55.845]  We see the Earth from here.
[01:07:58.227 --> 01:07:58.727]  You got it.
[01:08:00.429 --> 01:08:02.050]  We see what the globalists are doing.
[01:08:03.431 --> 01:08:04.132]  We don't like it.
[01:08:20.347 --> 01:08:21.648]  Let's go ahead and get right into it.
[01:08:21.668 --> 01:08:27.371]  I'm going to shift gears, open the phones up until the head of Project Veritas joins us next hour.
[01:08:30.512 --> 01:08:31.433]  25 minutes.
[01:08:31.453 --> 01:08:34.114]  I've only aired four minutes of it last hour and this hour.
[01:08:35.675 --> 01:08:47.582]  25 minutes of head Google executives snot noses out of college maybe five years, literally calling it fairness to make sure Trump loses in 2020.
[01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:53.119]  And saying, we don't care what Congress does, we're going to keep doing it.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.801]  Well, guess what, you little criminals?
[01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:57.621]  You were founded in this country with U.S.
[01:08:57.661 --> 01:08:58.222]  government money.
[01:08:58.682 --> 01:09:01.703]  And your election meddling and your distraction with the Russians isn't going to work.
[01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:04.244]  So we'll see how this goes for you.
[01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:08.846]  And little birdies told me a lot more.
[01:09:09.086 --> 01:09:13.948]  Little, fat, juicy birdies told me a lot more is coming.
[01:09:17.614 --> 01:09:20.696]  So get ready for all of that to come out.
[01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:26.300]  And by the way, if you work at Google, if you work at Facebook or Twitter, you don't have to be Project Veritas.
[01:09:27.741 --> 01:09:33.406]  All you gotta do is go out with these executives and record them bragging about it and send it to Veritas.
[01:09:33.746 --> 01:09:34.366]  Send it to us.
[01:09:34.526 --> 01:09:35.367]  Veritas loves us.
[01:09:35.427 --> 01:09:37.909]  I tell folks a lot of times, send it to Veritas.
[01:09:38.509 --> 01:09:39.490]  They can take them out too.
[01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:40.831]  Send it to us, we'll put it out as well.
[01:09:41.492 --> 01:09:42.833]  And just blur it all out.
[01:09:43.933 --> 01:09:44.654]  But who cares?
[01:09:45.034 --> 01:09:45.815]  Get fired!
[01:09:47.611 --> 01:09:49.714]  Get in there over the next few months and then go public.
[01:09:50.555 --> 01:09:51.996]  They're engaged in criminal activity.
[01:09:52.016 --> 01:09:52.937]  You're not going to get in trouble.
[01:09:54.019 --> 01:09:58.664]  Blow their operations politically, peacefully, lovingly wide open.
[01:09:59.245 --> 01:10:03.290]  Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill to strip Google and others of Section 230.
[01:10:05.253 --> 01:10:11.236]  That's their immunity, where they claim, oh, we don't censor, we don't judge anything unless it's illegal.
[01:10:11.977 --> 01:10:20.301]  So they are given liability protection, something I don't have, something the Wall Street Journal doesn't have as publishers, but that they have.
[01:10:22.242 --> 01:10:23.003]  That they have.
[01:10:24.243 --> 01:10:25.884]  And then they engage in all this activity.
[01:10:25.904 --> 01:10:32.948]  We have all the years they've been caught, all the election meddling, all the admissions, all the perjury to Congress, Sundar Pichai.
[01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.932]  Here's the Senator.
[01:10:38.352 --> 01:10:43.955]  So you said a second ago that these companies are discriminated against, conservatives and libertarians, and of course it's true.
[01:10:44.755 --> 01:10:50.738]  Libertarians, however, would argue against what you're trying to do, and I think their argument would be, well if you don't like it, start your own Google.
[01:10:51.494 --> 01:10:56.079]  Right, and the problem with that is, is that when you have a monopoly, as Google really does, I mean, good luck with that.
[01:10:56.139 --> 01:11:01.965]  I mean, companies have tried to start up, Google buys them, Google suppresses them, engages in anti-competitive conduct.
[01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:05.148]  You know, some people say, oh, this is forced speech.
[01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:07.871]  My approach is forcing the companies to engage in speech.
[01:11:07.891 --> 01:11:08.731]  That's just nonsense.
[01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:17.401]  I don't want the companies to speak in any particular way.
[01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:18.483]  My point is just this.
[01:11:18.683 --> 01:11:21.566]  Stop discriminating against conservatives.
[01:11:21.666 --> 01:11:25.270]  Stop suppressing other viewpoints that you don't agree with.
[01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:26.512]  I mean it's just as simple as that.
[01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:38.406]  But unless I'm missing something, what your bill would do would just remove the special protections that they have that, for example, I do not enjoy as a broadcaster, Fox News as a news company, we don't enjoy.
[01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:39.047]  We can be sued.
[01:11:39.067 --> 01:11:41.850]  If we defame somebody, we commit fraud, we can be sued.
[01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:42.951]  We don't have this immunity.
[01:11:43.392 --> 01:11:45.895]  And all your bill would do is just put them into my category.
[01:11:46.175 --> 01:11:46.955]  That's exactly right.
[01:11:46.995 --> 01:11:48.316]  I mean, that's exactly right.
[01:11:48.336 --> 01:11:54.317]  I mean, to be clear, these big tech companies, Facebook and Google and YouTube and Twitter, they have a deal that nobody else has.
[01:11:54.437 --> 01:11:55.998]  No media company has this deal.
[01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:57.918]  No other publisher has this deal.
[01:11:58.338 --> 01:12:02.039]  They have this special carve-out, this special handout from government.
[01:12:02.539 --> 01:12:06.060]  And if they want to keep it, my view is they should quit discriminating.
[01:12:06.401 --> 01:12:10.542]  On the other hand, if they want to discriminate against conservatives, if they want to push a liberal agenda, that's fine.
[01:12:10.682 --> 01:12:15.243]  But you shouldn't get, they shouldn't get, these special deals that nobody else gets.
[01:12:16.391 --> 01:12:17.632]  Then they can live like the rest of us.
[01:12:18.012 --> 01:12:19.533]  Senator, God bless you for doing this.
[01:12:19.973 --> 01:12:26.877]  I'm so glad that you are, and I really look forward to finding out who opposes this, because it will tell us everything, I think.
[01:12:27.137 --> 01:12:27.978]  Senator, great to see you tonight.
[01:12:28.338 --> 01:12:28.998]  Thanks for having me.
[01:12:29.919 --> 01:12:31.240]  That's right, and so here's what's happening.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.782]  The globalists and their allies, the CHICOMs, that's really what we're talking about here.
[01:12:35.222 --> 01:12:37.123]  Hollywood, the globalists, the CHICOMs, the EU.
[01:12:37.804 --> 01:12:38.264]  Parasites.
[01:12:40.086 --> 01:12:42.367]  They know that the comeuppance is here.
[01:12:42.447 --> 01:12:43.388]  They know Judgment Day's here.
[01:12:43.408 --> 01:12:44.368]  They know the world's waking up.
[01:12:44.789 --> 01:12:50.932]  So they're just racing to try to keep their people in office, to politically block it and bring in classical authoritarianism.
[01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:58.956]  Instead of getting caught lying, stopping, instead of being caught being bullies, backing off, they've gone, hey, let's just quadruple everything.
[01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:01.457]  Let's quintuple everything.
[01:13:03.638 --> 01:13:04.399]  It's worse than that.
[01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:06.880]  And so they're going for broke.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.261]  So we're in a fight.
[01:13:09.608 --> 01:13:13.752]  And the good news is they've been so arrogant that we've got all the proof.
[01:13:15.073 --> 01:13:26.823]  And, again, Google doesn't list Congress people running for office, Republican videos, when they pay to air them on TV and they end up on YouTube.
[01:13:26.863 --> 01:13:27.544]  They delist them.
[01:13:27.564 --> 01:13:28.244]  They shadow ban them.
[01:13:28.324 --> 01:13:28.945]  That's all admitted.
[01:13:29.085 --> 01:13:29.805]  That's election meddling.
[01:13:30.186 --> 01:13:36.831]  They don't let people see a Republican that cuts an ad, pays for it on TV, has a YouTube channel, puts it up there,
[01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:40.056]  In some cases, they refuse to even run the ads.
[01:13:40.196 --> 01:13:41.657]  Very milquetoast ads.
[01:13:42.358 --> 01:13:48.261]  Well, there's hundreds of court cases on newspapers and TV stations refusing to run political ads.
[01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:51.283]  If they're taking the opposition's ad, they've got to take your ad.
[01:13:53.504 --> 01:13:55.225]  Or you'd have a monopoly of ideas.
[01:13:55.785 --> 01:13:58.127]  This is the opposite of government regulation.
[01:13:59.278 --> 01:14:03.079]  These are prohibitive regulations on regulations on discrimination.
[01:14:03.719 --> 01:14:07.580]  Because Google and Facebook and Twitter and all these groups are bigger than most countries.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.001]  Google's GDP is almost as big as countries like Sweden.
[01:14:14.761 --> 01:14:16.362]  Apple's is as big as France.
[01:14:16.402 --> 01:14:16.762]  Look it up.
[01:14:17.182 --> 01:14:19.402]  It's insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:20.482 --> 01:14:20.883]  Look it up.
[01:14:21.063 --> 01:14:22.803]  It's out of control.
[01:14:24.031 --> 01:14:39.098]  And they are taking the regulations of China and the EU that are totally un-American and totally anti-free speech and by extension because Congress has enacted to protect American citizens and to protect the Internet that we built.
[01:14:39.358 --> 01:14:52.564]  You know, it'd be one thing if we hadn't built the damn thing and hadn't launched the thing and if our government didn't want dominance over the world with it as this big system and then now it's been handed away to the globalists.
[01:14:53.735 --> 01:14:58.198]  And then now it's going to be used to screw us when we built it and paid for the stinker?
[01:14:58.978 --> 01:14:59.139]  No.
[01:15:00.499 --> 01:15:06.063]  But see, we started using it for good.
[01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:07.944]  They thought we wouldn't use it for good.
[01:15:07.964 --> 01:15:12.247]  They thought we would adapt by submitting to being slaves and go away.
[01:15:12.767 --> 01:15:21.173]  They thought we'd just live our short little lives out and the post-human era would be here and the Silicon Gods, the AI gods that everybody warns about now that I first told you about 20 years ago.
[01:15:22.073 --> 01:15:23.313]  The globalists are in a weird cult.
[01:15:23.634 --> 01:15:25.094]  They're gonna merge the machines and be gods.
[01:15:25.794 --> 01:15:26.315]  Remember all that?
[01:15:29.016 --> 01:15:33.458]  And see, remember the executive telling me, the head of the big bank, you'll just adapt to being a slave?
[01:15:33.858 --> 01:15:35.398]  The public will never... No, guess what?
[01:15:35.859 --> 01:15:36.139]  Guess what?
[01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:37.599]  It doesn't work that way, jackass!
[01:15:37.919 --> 01:15:40.260]  You keep convincing yourself that's the way it works.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:48.504]  It works that way for a while, and then there's a giant backlash, a blowback, and you're going to pay in royal flush spades.
[01:15:50.624 --> 01:15:51.805]  It's called a fighting spirit.
[01:15:53.837 --> 01:16:00.179]  You think I want to be one of these chicken neck Google scum or Apple scum that runs slave factories and live off that?
[01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:01.179]  You think I want to be you?
[01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:04.881]  This is CNN.
[01:16:10.443 --> 01:16:12.883]  So here's Lepto, but there's good news!
[01:16:14.384 --> 01:16:20.366]  I don't just come on air, willy-nilly, without something to offer you!
[01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:26.580]  Not only is Lefto the Clown here live for this segment, but I got good news!
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:33.802]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, Lefto the Clown has friends out there in the political community.
[01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.942]  A lot of them are in the government.
[01:16:36.263 --> 01:16:41.804]  And some of them want to be President of the United States!
[01:16:43.305 --> 01:16:44.025]  That's right!
[01:16:44.845 --> 01:16:49.787]  Some of Lefto's buddies are running for President of the United States!
[01:16:50.754 --> 01:16:55.139]  Now I know you're out there probably jumping for joy, but hold your horses!
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:59.543]  Because there's even more to be excited about!
[01:16:59.563 --> 01:17:09.954]  Not just that Lefto's friends are running for president, but that next week, they will be hosting a clown show!
[01:17:11.124 --> 01:17:12.225]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:17:12.705 --> 01:17:17.609]  Next week, the Democrats are having their first presidential debates!
[01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:20.011]  And you know what that means!
[01:17:20.611 --> 01:17:22.613]  It's the Clown World Show!
[01:17:22.673 --> 01:17:24.574]  The greatest comedy show on Earth!
[01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.556]  The first Democrat debate!
[01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:39.466]  But ladies and gentlemen, we're so committed to your entertainment, we're so committed to you getting the full picture, we're so committed to the Clown World, we're gonna shake it up a bit!
[01:17:40.645 --> 01:17:55.791]  Not only do we have one night of presidential Democrat debates, we give you two nights of The Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth, and the best news is yet to come!
[01:17:57.012 --> 01:18:02.334]  It's all gonna be streamed live at InfoWars.com slash show!
[01:18:03.614 --> 01:18:05.415]  InfoWars.
[01:18:05.535 --> 01:18:09.877]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:18:10.493 --> 01:18:15.459]  InfoWars settles Pepe the Frog lawsuit, pays tiny settlement to creator Matt Fury.
[01:18:15.559 --> 01:18:17.181]  Mark, overall, what do you think of this decision?
[01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:17.802]  Mark Rendazzo.
[01:18:17.922 --> 01:18:27.954]  I mean, look, when they come at us first saying they want $1.2 million in attorney's fees, and then they wind up begging us for a pittance of a settlement.
[01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:30.872]  I think that's grounds for a victory lap.
[01:18:31.272 --> 01:18:34.554]  I mean, the amount that you wound up paying them for a licensing fee.
[01:18:34.614 --> 01:18:43.401]  I mean, when we were calculating what it would have cost for, you know, your first class flight to L.A., the kind of hotels that we like to stay in and the kind of meals we like to eat.
[01:18:43.721 --> 01:18:46.503]  I think our bar tab would have been more than that in L.A.
[01:18:46.523 --> 01:18:47.123]  just for the week.
[01:18:47.363 --> 01:18:55.009]  I just, I have a very big feeling of satisfaction when they put as many lawyers on the other side of the table as I have in my entire firm.
[01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:03.894]  And then they squeak out the door with a, you know, essentially it was like you flipped a coin to them and said, here, get out of my way, go buy yourself an ice cream.
[01:19:03.994 --> 01:19:12.319]  The thing you were saying earlier about how your viewers and your listeners helped out in order to help you win this free speech fight, I can't reiterate that enough.
[01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:19.023]  You know, when you have stood up on these cases, you're not standing up just for Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[01:19:19.283 --> 01:19:20.764]  You're standing up for everybody's rights.
[01:19:21.545 --> 01:19:27.533]  And, you know, now that this case is over, you know, you can kind of start reloading the guns, but there's gonna be more.
[01:19:27.613 --> 01:19:28.174]  You know that.
[01:19:28.334 --> 01:19:28.774]  Well said.
[01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:41.608]  A classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any info warrior serious about their oral health.
[01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:45.930]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:19:46.091 --> 01:19:49.893]  Fueled by the good halogen iodine and high quality nano silver.
[01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:54.876]  We've taken the fluoride out and replaced it with powerful ingredients to help boost your smile.
[01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:57.077]  Don't miss out on one of our best products.
[01:19:57.257 --> 01:20:02.060]  Power up your morning routine with Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at the InfoWars store.
[01:20:06.849 --> 01:20:09.550]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.012 --> 01:20:16.653]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:17.994]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:22.228 --> 01:20:30.920]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:36.227]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[01:20:37.228 --> 01:20:46.232]  You know Google is helping China with Dragonfly, and you know that they're helping censor, and you know, you know that you've sold this country out, and you won't even help the Pentagon, you'll help the CHICOMS.
[01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.333]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar!
[01:20:48.373 --> 01:20:56.076]  We're aware of his lying to Congress, we're aware of him and the Dragonfly project, that's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government, now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[01:20:56.136 --> 01:20:56.576]  Sundar!
[01:20:57.176 --> 01:20:58.397]  You're engaged in treason!
[01:20:58.917 --> 01:21:01.818]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress that you're not censoring conservatives!
[01:21:01.938 --> 01:21:14.885]  The big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing, to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[01:21:14.965 --> 01:21:19.968]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[01:21:20.148 --> 01:21:24.570]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:26.191]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[01:21:26.471 --> 01:21:27.752]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[01:21:28.172 --> 01:21:30.554]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[01:21:30.674 --> 01:21:31.755]  Google is evil!
[01:21:32.175 --> 01:21:33.256]  Google is evil!
[01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:34.937]  Google is evil!
[01:21:34.997 --> 01:21:40.781]  Twitter is planning to permanently suspend Alex Jones' personal account at InfoWars.
[01:21:40.801 --> 01:21:46.164]  This comes after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was on Capitol Hill yesterday speaking with lawmakers.
[01:21:46.264 --> 01:21:48.706]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[01:21:48.766 --> 01:21:54.130]  The social networking site permanently banning he and his media company, InfoWars.
[01:21:54.970 --> 01:21:58.972]  I appreciate you made the First Amendment, but I have a right to face my accusers, Jack.
[01:21:59.012 --> 01:22:01.614]  They're lying about me and they're trying to deplatform me.
[01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:04.595]  26 companies working in concert violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[01:22:04.676 --> 01:22:09.678]  And now, Senator Warner and Senator Wyden have said, quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex Jones.
[01:22:10.219 --> 01:22:13.620]  So, we're becoming like Cuba, we're becoming like Vietnam, we're becoming like China.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:23.406]  So regardless of what people think about me or the straw men, should I have a First Amendment or should these companies be able to violate the whole Safe Harbor Act and all that and then ban conservatives en masse?
[01:22:24.787 --> 01:22:26.031]  Yeah, I don't know anything about your site.
[01:22:26.092 --> 01:22:27.697]  And we're also standing up...
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.421]  To social media censorship.
[01:22:31.461 --> 01:22:32.302]  That's the new thing.
[01:22:32.562 --> 01:22:38.585]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[01:22:38.605 --> 01:22:39.305]  This is weird, man.
[01:22:39.586 --> 01:22:40.266]  Oh yeah, it's really weird.
[01:22:40.306 --> 01:22:41.426]  There's no purge of conservatives?
[01:22:41.466 --> 01:22:42.567]  There's no shadowbanning?
[01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:45.248]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[01:22:45.268 --> 01:22:45.969]  Yeah, who's this guy?
[01:22:46.009 --> 01:22:46.629]  We deployed for him.
[01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:48.710]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.411]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[01:22:51.632 --> 01:22:55.994]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... It's happening here, but you say I don't exist.
[01:22:56.414 --> 01:22:57.935]  Is that a heckler, a press, or a gaggle?
[01:22:57.995 --> 01:22:58.656]  Look at this guy.
[01:22:58.696 --> 01:23:00.177]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[01:23:00.597 --> 01:23:02.098]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[01:23:02.138 --> 01:23:03.319]  I don't read weird websites.
[01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:03.679]  Sure.
[01:23:03.759 --> 01:23:05.821]  And they demonize me in these very hearings.
[01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:07.322]  And then he plays dumb.
[01:23:07.642 --> 01:23:09.363]  Infowars.com, you know where it is.
[01:23:09.383 --> 01:23:12.725]  Does Google, does Facebook, does Twitter, do they need to be regulated?
[01:23:12.745 --> 01:23:14.307]  Do they need to be regulated?
[01:23:14.367 --> 01:23:15.627]  Marco Rubio, the snake.
[01:23:15.728 --> 01:23:17.389]  This is a dumbass.
[01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:18.590]  Alright, man.
[01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.570]  Who are you, man?
[01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:20.231]  Who is this guy?
[01:23:20.271 --> 01:23:22.112]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are, man.
[01:23:22.332 --> 01:23:23.113]  Tens of millions of views.
[01:23:23.653 --> 01:23:24.133]  InfoWars.
[01:23:24.153 --> 01:23:25.034]  Bigger than Russell Embaugh?
[01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:26.555]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:27.695]  He's playing this joke over here.
[01:23:27.855 --> 01:23:29.216]  That's why the deplatforming didn't work.
[01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:33.839]  The most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:23:33.879 --> 01:23:38.001]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat him...
[01:23:38.908 --> 01:23:39.989]  Prevent them from speaking!
[01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:43.411]  On Twitter, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story.
[01:23:43.651 --> 01:23:49.815]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[01:23:49.895 --> 01:23:50.995]  The system self-corrected.
[01:23:51.116 --> 01:23:53.977]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[01:23:53.997 --> 01:23:56.219]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[01:23:57.419 --> 01:23:58.220]  But you saw this?
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.161]  USA Today.
[01:23:59.561 --> 01:24:00.681]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[01:24:00.842 --> 01:24:03.103]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[01:24:03.183 --> 01:24:10.830]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:12.091]  Just like communist China.
[01:24:12.271 --> 01:24:17.856]  We need you to act now and move against big tech censorship, President Trump.
[01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:22.320]  CNN and the Democrats you know are destroying the First Amendment and needs to be stood up against.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:29.247]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[01:24:29.707 --> 01:24:37.428]  Look at this right here, the guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[01:24:37.889 --> 01:24:39.949]  You are incredibly shameful, man.
[01:24:39.969 --> 01:24:40.729]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:46.530]  You're just a, look at you, look what, you are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:56.512]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[01:25:00.445 --> 01:25:07.189]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:25:11.452 --> 01:25:13.052]  Have you heard the news, baby?
[01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:17.655]  Google admits it.
[01:25:18.916 --> 01:25:20.517]  They say Trump will never get re-elected.
[01:25:22.738 --> 01:25:24.259]  They say they're gonna shut him down.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.162]  It's called liberalism and leftist propaganda.
[01:25:30.356 --> 01:25:32.517]  Huh.
[01:25:32.557 --> 01:25:32.897]  Guess what?
[01:25:32.957 --> 01:25:33.637]  They're gonna fail.
[01:25:36.518 --> 01:25:40.499]  That's why they work around the clock to shut down InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:25:40.539 --> 01:25:56.142]  And you know, we were one of the few organizations when Matt Drudge came here, and I talk about this all the time, because it's so seminal, so pivotal, so critical, so important, so providential.
[01:25:57.723 --> 01:25:58.583]  It's the word I was looking for.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:00.841]  They're all applicable.
[01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:02.462]  Came here.
[01:26:03.223 --> 01:26:08.708]  He said, listen, you're one of the few people that's built an infrastructure outside their system.
[01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:13.573]  He said, obviously, I've got one even bigger.
[01:26:16.576 --> 01:26:21.441]  And he said on air and he said off air, Hillary, they believe is going to be installed.
[01:26:22.728 --> 01:26:26.290]  They're going to come out with a free speech with the Euro targeting the U.S.
[01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:27.471]  Exactly what he said.
[01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:38.298]  He didn't get that from under a cabbage leaf in the farmer's garden.
[01:26:40.019 --> 01:26:41.520]  He didn't get it from Mr. McGregor.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:51.586]  He got it from a Supreme Court Justice and they go to these conferences and they get briefed on the globalist program and they had inducted them all into the globalist
[01:26:53.376 --> 01:26:53.997]  Compact.
[01:26:55.458 --> 01:26:57.740]  Back in the 50s after World War II for world peace.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.363]  And they got all the big brains on board both parties.
[01:27:01.503 --> 01:27:03.885]  Well now people are realizing globalism isn't good.
[01:27:04.225 --> 01:27:05.306]  Globalism is authoritarian.
[01:27:05.346 --> 01:27:06.267]  It isn't meant to bring peace.
[01:27:06.548 --> 01:27:08.289]  It's meant to bring total control.
[01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:13.313]  And so there's a rebellion within the system.
[01:27:16.036 --> 01:27:18.138]  But there isn't an opposition.
[01:27:19.505 --> 01:27:24.487]  Without to organize and codify and to be a focal point of what's happening.
[01:27:24.547 --> 01:27:26.747]  And that's why InfoWars is so important.
[01:27:26.767 --> 01:27:27.407]  I go back to that.
[01:27:28.808 --> 01:27:30.028]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:34.770]  And thanks to your prayers, thanks to your support, thanks to all the things you've done, we're still on air.
[01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:36.490]  But listen, we make it easy.
[01:27:38.291 --> 01:27:42.192]  Everyone, we have it for children and adults, should be taking fish oil.
[01:27:43.305 --> 01:27:45.386]  We have the small caplets and the big caplets.
[01:27:45.466 --> 01:27:46.547]  The very best out there.
[01:27:46.947 --> 01:27:47.487]  The purest.
[01:27:48.048 --> 01:27:48.908]  The highest quality.
[01:27:49.469 --> 01:27:54.011]  We went to more than a dozen top manufacturers that have the top ratings already to have these private labeled.
[01:27:55.732 --> 01:27:56.733]  Our ultimate krill oil?
[01:27:56.993 --> 01:27:57.933]  You're not going to find anything like it.
[01:27:58.113 --> 01:27:59.034]  Our ultimate fish oil?
[01:27:59.074 --> 01:27:59.594]  Nothing like it.
[01:27:59.854 --> 01:28:00.835]  Honor roll for children?
[01:28:01.295 --> 01:28:01.876]  Nothing like it.
[01:28:02.436 --> 01:28:03.497]  This is what my children take.

[01:28:58.864 --> 01:29:00.144]  Please support us today.
[01:29:00.424 --> 01:29:01.405]  These sales are big.
[01:29:06.027 --> 01:29:07.668]  Folks, you want people to fight for America.
[01:29:07.688 --> 01:29:09.869]  You want people to stand up and say no to the globalists.
[01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:13.452]  You want people to report on the Clintons and all the pedophile rings that are now in the news.
[01:29:13.872 --> 01:29:17.354]  You want people to, you know, expose globalism or the Islamic invasion.
[01:29:17.594 --> 01:29:18.455]  We're doing it.
[01:29:18.575 --> 01:29:19.635]  And we're not backing down.
[01:29:19.775 --> 01:29:22.277]  And we're exposing the Covington hoax first.
[01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.157]  We expose it first.
[01:29:23.217 --> 01:29:24.198]  We're exposing it all.
[01:29:24.298 --> 01:29:25.679]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:29:25.719 --> 01:29:26.499]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:29:26.519 --> 01:29:32.063]  And that's why everybody has to remember, we're running a Save InfoWars special right now.
[01:29:32.603 --> 01:29:35.345]  To get more capital in because we've not been able to expand.
[01:29:35.366 --> 01:29:37.107]  We've actually been contracting some.
[01:29:37.247 --> 01:29:39.029]  The enemy has been winning with all their attacks.
[01:29:39.049 --> 01:29:47.556]  We're still reaching a lot of people thanks to you, but we need capital to get more reporters to the field to launch a bunch of stuff we've got ready to do that is going to devastate the globalists.
[01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:49.898]  We've proven we don't talk, we deliver.
[01:29:49.938 --> 01:29:50.979]  But I need war bonds.
[01:29:51.059 --> 01:29:51.760]  I need capital.
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.081]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:29:53.281 --> 01:29:54.302]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:29:55.143 --> 01:29:55.363]  50% off.
[01:29:55.403 --> 01:29:56.504]  Double Patriot points.
[01:29:56.724 --> 01:30:00.665]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[01:30:00.845 --> 01:30:03.926]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:30:03.946 --> 01:30:10.548]  We've got a bunch of new Made in America shirts with really soft designer fabric and really the highest quality imprints.
[01:30:10.768 --> 01:30:15.189]  The shirts are costing us up to $15 a piece and we're selling them on sale for $19.99.
[01:30:15.749 --> 01:30:18.832]  As I've said the other day and I said to the people in the press,
[01:30:33.463 --> 01:30:37.647]  Your case is the template case for American freedom moving forward.
[01:30:38.007 --> 01:30:46.895]  And it's whether or not they can break the InfoWars base, whether or not they can stop the InfoWars audience from supporting the InfoWars network.
[01:30:46.935 --> 01:30:53.620]  Because again, like you said in corporate documents, the model of self-funding, self-sales is the thing that corporations, the globalists fear.
[01:30:53.941 --> 01:30:57.944]  Because crowdsourcing and individuals doing this scares the living daylights out of them.
[01:30:58.064 --> 01:30:58.545]  Absolutely.
[01:30:58.665 --> 01:31:02.631]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:14.548]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:31:14.748 --> 01:31:30.861]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country that he tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[01:31:31.261 --> 01:31:43.751]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been blocked by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.033]  And the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[01:31:46.093 --> 01:31:51.017]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age of ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[01:31:51.097 --> 01:31:58.723]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of de-platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[01:32:07.079 --> 01:32:11.001]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[01:32:11.442 --> 01:32:13.243]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:32:13.363 --> 01:32:14.064]  Good to talk to you.
[01:32:14.404 --> 01:32:18.567]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:32:18.787 --> 01:32:20.548]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[01:32:20.628 --> 01:32:25.031]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:32:25.211 --> 01:32:27.133]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:32:27.213 --> 01:32:30.735]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:32:30.755 --> 01:32:31.556]  I appreciate that.
[01:32:31.656 --> 01:32:33.117]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:32:33.157 --> 01:32:33.657]  Tell us about it.
[01:32:33.677 --> 01:32:34.418]  Well, it's really great.
[01:32:34.438 --> 01:32:35.638]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:32:35.679 --> 01:32:36.119]  I take it.
[01:32:36.179 --> 01:32:36.799]  It tastes good.
[01:32:36.859 --> 01:32:38.541]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:40.302]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:32:40.462 --> 01:32:43.745]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:32:43.785 --> 01:32:46.467]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:32:46.487 --> 01:32:48.028]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:32:48.168 --> 01:32:50.009]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.630]  So, yeah.
[01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:52.871]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[01:32:53.332 --> 01:32:55.654]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[01:32:56.014 --> 01:32:56.914]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:32:57.075 --> 01:32:58.836]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:33:06.312 --> 01:33:15.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.702]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:33:30.642 --> 01:33:34.524]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:42.762 --> 01:33:44.642]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:44.702 --> 01:34:02.127]  I intend to get into all the other big breaking news ahead of James O'Keefe and Project Veritas with the stunning, caught red-handed, holy grail of top Google executives admitting how they censor conservatives, nationalists, pro-Trump people to make sure Trump loses in 2020.
[01:34:02.907 --> 01:34:05.447]  Staggering admission of election meddling.
[01:34:07.668 --> 01:34:12.249]  Google's staggering admission of election meddling.
[01:34:13.061 --> 01:34:22.383]  In the Project Veritas report, it's just too unbelievable that they would pull something like this off, and that Trump sits there doing nothing.
[01:34:22.403 --> 01:34:26.704]  This is so criminal, telling Congress, you can pressure us, but we're not changing.
[01:34:27.044 --> 01:34:29.264]  Get Paul Watson's report out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:29.644 --> 01:34:37.146]  We can override the big tech, because the truth moves slow, but once it moves, it overpowers lies.
[01:34:38.933 --> 01:34:40.094]  Please get the articles out.
[01:34:40.154 --> 01:34:43.157]  Please get the videos out at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.040]  Incredible.
[01:34:47.302 --> 01:34:48.603]  But why do they want us silenced?
[01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:52.767]  You know, the great part about the internet was the algorithm is just your voting.
[01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:54.329]  They want to act like it's something fancy.
[01:34:54.849 --> 01:35:02.257]  When you vote for an article, when you promote an article, when you click on an article, when you share an article, it drives up the algorithm in the old system.
[01:35:03.223 --> 01:35:04.183]  That's all it is.
[01:35:04.263 --> 01:35:06.404]  The execs want to act like, oh, they've got some magic.
[01:35:06.844 --> 01:35:08.225]  It's popularity.
[01:35:08.745 --> 01:35:23.351]  It's the people saying, hey, this restaurant's better, or this airline's better, or this doctor's better, or this vitamin I took was better, or this drug was better, or these jeans fit better, or these shoes lasted longer, or this national park was better.
[01:35:24.731 --> 01:35:26.972]  And everybody knows, you pull into a small town, you're on a road trip,
[01:35:27.984 --> 01:35:30.207]  I don't ever look at Google Maps or Google Restaurants.
[01:35:30.527 --> 01:35:34.292]  I see, well that restaurant's got cars all the way around the block.
[01:35:36.234 --> 01:35:38.838]  And I might just get my name on the list and do some reading.
[01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:43.123]  Because I want to see why these restaurants have almost nobody at them.
[01:35:43.183 --> 01:35:44.985]  Five, six cars at that one, two or three at that one.
[01:35:45.839 --> 01:35:56.105]  I bet you get food poisoning at that one, but that one with a big line out the door, mmm, I bet that's some good Mexican food, or some good Italian food, or some good southern cooking, or some good soul food.
[01:35:56.765 --> 01:35:59.466]  And you know what, you go in there and you're like, good lord, this is good!
[01:36:00.667 --> 01:36:06.290]  But the time the line's too big and you go, I'll go over to that place that doesn't have anybody in it, you get food poisoning.
[01:36:08.031 --> 01:36:11.273]  I was in Waco going to a funeral five years ago with my kids.
[01:36:13.186 --> 01:36:16.547]  And I went, instead of the place we normally go, I went to another place.
[01:36:20.067 --> 01:36:22.988]  With, I'm not going to even say the name of it, I don't want to be mean to him.
[01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:24.788]  God Almighty.
[01:36:26.049 --> 01:36:31.550]  There were cockroaches, big ones, running around while we were eating under the table and over the side.
[01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:37.411]  And this is a place that's been there since the 20s, since that big roundabout.
[01:36:38.905 --> 01:36:42.008]  Old-fashioned European roundabout like El Chico's right here, right here's the other place.
[01:36:42.648 --> 01:36:48.293]  And I mean, biggest cockroach I ever saw, at least four inches long, came out on the table.
[01:36:48.673 --> 01:36:49.694]  And I killed the bastard.
[01:36:50.915 --> 01:36:51.356]  And we left.
[01:36:52.757 --> 01:36:54.498]  And we didn't get any food because we were late for the funeral.
[01:36:55.799 --> 01:36:57.701]  And that was because El Chico's okay.
[01:36:57.741 --> 01:36:59.342]  It's not even that good, but it's decent.
[01:36:59.883 --> 01:37:00.884]  But eating there, so I was a little kid.
[01:37:01.204 --> 01:37:02.965]  It's one of the old chains in Texas.
[01:37:03.506 --> 01:37:04.567]  El Chico had a line.
[01:37:08.246 --> 01:37:09.127]  El Chico had a line.
[01:37:09.187 --> 01:37:16.731]  It was an afternoon funeral for my great-uncle, with the army out there, you know, shooting the rifles and all the rest of it, for his officer's burial.
[01:37:16.751 --> 01:37:18.332]  They were going to bury him at about four.
[01:37:20.153 --> 01:37:23.234]  And we pulled in there about noon, and there was a line.
[01:37:23.274 --> 01:37:26.016]  We had another three hours to go, so we hit the other place.
[01:37:26.596 --> 01:37:27.697]  You know, I'm digressing here.
[01:37:27.817 --> 01:37:28.938]  I'm going into a long story.
[01:37:30.078 --> 01:37:30.939]  The point is, is that
[01:37:33.356 --> 01:37:35.997]  The old algorithm was what was popular and what people like.
[01:37:36.077 --> 01:37:36.717]  It's not that now.
[01:37:36.777 --> 01:37:37.858]  It's what they make you eat.
[01:37:38.638 --> 01:37:39.859]  It's what they send you to.
[01:37:40.119 --> 01:37:41.540]  It's what they make you observe.
[01:37:44.221 --> 01:37:47.502]  And so that's why they're so upset.
[01:37:49.823 --> 01:37:51.404]  That's why they don't know what to do.
[01:37:51.484 --> 01:37:56.786]  And in the old days, you could say, this drug hurt me, or this dental office was bad, or this place was great.
[01:37:59.467 --> 01:38:00.468]  But no, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:38:01.428 --> 01:38:18.096]  They're saying with vaccines that are government-protected, liability-protected, have a secret damage fund, that if a mother says her son got brain damage from it, whether she's right or wrong, that mother's got to shut her mouth on Facebook in America, because Big Pharma doesn't like it, lady!
[01:38:18.656 --> 01:38:27.660]  You're not going to tell us at the E-Lite Cafe, or wherever you're at, that you like it or you hate it.
[01:38:28.061 --> 01:38:28.781]  That was the place in Waco.
[01:38:30.762 --> 01:38:32.043]  You're going to shut your mouth.
[01:38:32.223 --> 01:38:35.386]  Because it's one thing to have a cockroach run across your table.
[01:38:36.327 --> 01:38:42.772]  It's another thing to have your son have a convulsion and blood come out of his nose and he never talk again and wear diapers the rest of his life.
[01:38:45.074 --> 01:38:52.741]  You know, they had the 2-2-3 round, 5-5-6 to wound people in Vietnam so they'd get hurt and take more people to take care of them and not kill them.
[01:38:53.442 --> 01:38:54.743]  See, that's the same thing with autism.
[01:38:54.783 --> 01:38:56.744]  Make you take care of them for 50 years.
[01:38:57.065 --> 01:38:58.326]  Suck all your money out.
[01:38:59.042 --> 01:39:02.024]  Make you buy 100,000 diapers a year.
[01:39:04.846 --> 01:39:05.847]  Shove it in your face!
[01:39:09.269 --> 01:39:12.071]  We won't have time to play this whole report because I went off the reservation.
[01:39:14.133 --> 01:39:20.197]  But, uh, here's the first part of it with Greg Reese.
[01:39:21.678 --> 01:39:22.919]  You know, we'll just play it after the break.
[01:39:23.679 --> 01:39:25.301]  We're going to play this when we come back from break.
[01:39:26.198 --> 01:39:27.439]  Our phone system's broken today.
[01:39:27.479 --> 01:39:29.459]  I said I'd take calls, but we've got a problem with it.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.640]  That happens sometimes.
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:31.680]  They're rebooting it.
[01:39:31.981 --> 01:39:32.961]  Put the pieces of equipment in.
[01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.782]  Sometimes pieces of equipment just aren't there.
[01:39:35.822 --> 01:39:38.564]  They come up broken or whatever, and you just can't do it.
[01:39:38.884 --> 01:39:41.685]  We're working on putting the backup system in as fast as we can.
[01:39:47.027 --> 01:39:54.791]  You know, I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements.
[01:39:56.437 --> 01:40:07.947]  In that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:40:08.807 --> 01:40:13.091]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:16.634]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[01:40:17.418 --> 01:40:19.020]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:40:20.501 --> 01:40:25.646]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:40:25.706 --> 01:40:37.157]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:40:37.597 --> 01:40:40.120]  But then they say, you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:40:41.738 --> 01:40:43.501]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[01:40:44.041 --> 01:40:46.184]  If you don't have iodine in your body, you end up dying.
[01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:47.947]  If you don't have water, you end up dying.
[01:40:48.127 --> 01:40:50.310]  If you don't have sunshine, if you don't have oxygen, you die.
[01:40:51.271 --> 01:40:53.534]  It may take ten years with no sunshine, but you die.
[01:40:53.775 --> 01:40:55.677]  It may take four days with no water, but you die.
[01:40:55.918 --> 01:40:58.742]  It may take three weeks or four weeks with no food, but you die.
[01:41:01.434 --> 01:41:13.266]  And if you don't have a whole bunch of minerals and a whole bunch of vitamins and in the organic system where you can upload them, you will end up getting degenerative diseases quicker than you would have and you will die.
[01:41:14.988 --> 01:41:20.293]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:41:20.313 --> 01:41:21.435]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:41:21.815 --> 01:41:22.676]  They have side effects.
[01:41:23.597 --> 01:41:24.398]  Not with Mother Nature.
[01:41:25.373 --> 01:41:30.004]  I mean, there are some things in Mother Nature you take too much of, you'll have a side effect, but nothing like Big Pharma.
[01:41:30.024 --> 01:41:33.672]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:41:34.625 --> 01:41:58.011]  And so they sit there and they demonize us all day long when we sell things like Ultimate Bone Broth that's chaga mushroom, incredibly concentrated, high-quality turmeric, just raw turmeric, organic, and a bunch of other bee pollen mixed with organic, concentrated chicken bones that are rendered down where, there's no way to quantify it, but this is the strongest bone broth out there.
[01:41:58.191 --> 01:42:02.393]  You go to Whole Foods or you go to Central Market in Austin or wherever, and it's $10 for a little,
[01:42:04.293 --> 01:42:11.759]  A can of soup or glass mason jar of soup that says, oh, it's got chicken broth and mushrooms in it.
[01:42:11.999 --> 01:42:12.740]  Chaga mushroom.
[01:42:13.741 --> 01:42:14.481]  It's the same stuff.
[01:42:15.743 --> 01:42:19.746]  But it's not even a quarter scoop of what's in ours.
[01:42:21.327 --> 01:42:22.668]  You can make broth with this.
[01:42:23.008 --> 01:42:24.109]  You can put it in brownies.
[01:42:24.249 --> 01:42:27.012]  I mix it with whey and put some fruit in it and then it tastes great.
[01:42:27.984 --> 01:42:35.226]  The point is, is it's concentrated, it's uber strong, and it is 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:42:41.548 --> 01:42:43.689]  And we are unstoppable thanks to you.
[01:42:43.749 --> 01:42:45.509]  Plus, these are products you need.

[01:43:05.931 --> 01:43:22.001]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is in the ultimate economic democracy structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:43:22.021 --> 01:43:27.205]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach,
[01:43:27.925 --> 01:43:31.909]  It's reached so effective that that's why Facebook is waging war against InfoWars.
[01:43:31.949 --> 01:43:34.552]  That's why Instagram is waging war against InfoWars.
[01:43:34.632 --> 01:43:42.140]  That's why Google and YouTube and Twitter are waging war against InfoWars more than anyone else, is because it is the ultimate counter-China model.
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:50.088]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure.
[01:43:50.488 --> 01:44:00.177]  That because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[01:44:00.477 --> 01:44:05.902]  So by doing little things like, okay, we want a little de-democracy, we want a fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:44:05.922 --> 01:44:06.742]  Let's say that's what it is.
[01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:08.504]  So it's dealing with a particular health issue.
[01:44:08.664 --> 01:44:23.506]  Where you have the health industry pushing one product overwhelmingly, the big pharma, big companies, the corporate model, the Chinese model, the statist corporate model that China has promoted against Infowars' model, which is we're going to have an American-created product, we're going to sell that directly to our own people.
[01:44:23.946 --> 01:44:42.492]  Our people will decide whether they want to support it or not, and by choosing to buy little products like that, they're able to fuel this independent press that is the only one that is not dependent on billionaire donors or sugar daddies, that is not dependent on big corporate sponsors, that is not dependent on getting the approval of the social media giants in order to spread their message.
[01:44:42.632 --> 01:44:51.575]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[01:44:51.795 --> 01:45:00.181]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:45:00.382 --> 01:45:09.929]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets and doing so in a way that's not corporate driven.
[01:45:10.029 --> 01:45:25.518]  The reason why they don't see news change at InfoWars or content change at InfoWars except as requested or thought about by the audience is because the audience controls it, because the audience has chosen a self-supporting, self-sustaining economic model by making small contributions by buying products.
[01:45:26.258 --> 01:45:35.224]  They already want, at a more affordable rate, by sustaining it, they create a self-sustaining, self-supporting structure that is unique in the world, and that's why they wage war against it.
[01:45:35.244 --> 01:45:50.235]  And as long as the audience refuses to concede to that, or forfeit their economic contribution, as long as they continue to be involved, and continue to participate, and continue to partake, and continue this self-supporting, self-sustaining structure, there's nothing they can literally do to crush it or end it.
[01:45:50.855 --> 01:45:59.939]  They can try to limit the scope of the audience, they can try to limit the size of the microphone, but in the end, we will find ways to reach them because the audience dictates and determines it by its support of InfoWars.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:09.063]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[01:46:09.283 --> 01:46:15.466]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[01:46:15.766 --> 01:46:18.267]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits,
[01:46:18.487 --> 01:46:21.910]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[01:46:22.210 --> 01:46:28.416]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[01:46:28.676 --> 01:46:34.722]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[01:46:35.242 --> 01:46:42.244]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[01:46:42.484 --> 01:46:49.366]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[01:46:49.566 --> 01:46:53.927]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[01:46:54.428 --> 01:47:02.550]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at infowarestore.com.
[01:47:06.215 --> 01:47:08.917]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:08.937 --> 01:47:15.522]  I want to be clear.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:31.905]  They want to tell mothers and fathers whose children get damaged by vaccines, who get sick from them, that you can't make a consumer report.
[01:47:32.425 --> 01:47:37.129]  You gotta go to a secret court, sign papers not to talk about it, and maybe they'll give you some money.
[01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:45.635]  So it's an act of defiance to sit here and to tell the truth that they're putting things in vaccines, that they're damaging people.
[01:47:46.436 --> 01:47:47.757]  And we're not bitching and complaining.
[01:47:48.868 --> 01:48:02.392]  When people don't care about freedom or care about quality or care about corruption, you become Guatemala or the Dominican Republic, where some estimates are hundreds of thousands of people die a year from poisoned liquor.
[01:48:03.093 --> 01:48:05.614]  Because it's not even normal grain alcohol.
[01:48:06.474 --> 01:48:08.214]  It's industrial wood alcohol.
[01:48:08.795 --> 01:48:10.795]  And now the numbers are hundreds dead.
[01:48:11.315 --> 01:48:15.777]  They've just been covering it up for years in the Dominican Republic, dying
[01:48:16.963 --> 01:48:27.810]  From synthetic crappy wood alcohol put in the mini bars, where they can charge you $5, $10 for each drink, and it's got 10 cents of ethanol in it.
[01:48:30.111 --> 01:48:31.472]  You say, why would people do that?
[01:48:31.993 --> 01:48:33.454]  Because the society gives up.
[01:48:33.474 --> 01:48:36.075]  It's like, oh, let them keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[01:48:36.315 --> 01:48:39.557]  Oh, let drag queen story time convicted pedophiles come and talk to your kids.
[01:48:40.258 --> 01:48:41.819]  Oh, let them give kids the vaccines.
[01:48:41.859 --> 01:48:43.460]  Don't, you know, don't look at the damages of it.
[01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:45.631]  They want us to give up.
[01:48:45.671 --> 01:48:51.394]  So here's a powerful report that we really need to get to from Greg Reeves that I hope everybody shares.
[01:48:51.434 --> 01:48:54.416]  Big Pharma forced vaccinations and population control.
[01:48:55.777 --> 01:48:57.659]  It's here, folks, and it's real tyranny.
[01:49:00.761 --> 01:49:09.727]  The mainstream pop culture narrative tells us to trust vaccines and labels individuals who do not as anti-vaxxers.
[01:49:11.056 --> 01:49:17.079]  But when you look at the history of the vaccine industry, there are many good reasons to question them.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:28.365]  In 1986, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was established to protect the vaccine manufacturers from any liabilities.
[01:49:29.926 --> 01:49:36.450]  This program ensured that the taxpayer would pay for all injuries the public suffered from vaccines.
[01:49:37.951 --> 01:49:47.253]  Once this protection was in place, government purchasing of vaccines increased by over 300 percent.
[01:49:47.373 --> 01:49:59.696]  In 1994, an unelected board of pediatricians was put in charge of determining which vaccines would be given to your children, all funded by pharmaceutical companies and U.S.
[01:49:59.756 --> 01:50:00.396]  taxpayers.
[01:50:02.076 --> 01:50:09.626]  Before Presidents Bush and Clinton incentivized the vaccine industry, it was about $100 million a year business.
[01:50:10.427 --> 01:50:16.696]  Bill Clinton proposed buying up all the vaccines and distributing them from a warehouse in New Jersey.
[01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.418]  Which Congress rejected.
[01:50:20.138 --> 01:50:27.080]  But still, thanks to Clinton's efforts, the government now controls every aspect of the vaccine industry.
[01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:31.422]  An industry that has grown accordingly ever since.
[01:50:32.622 --> 01:50:32.822]  Over 600%.
[01:50:33.823 --> 01:50:38.884]  It is expected to be a $60 billion a year business by 2020.
[01:50:39.325 --> 01:50:43.846]  Their profits have grown immensely.
[01:50:44.526 --> 01:50:46.327]  But what else have they accomplished?
[01:50:47.754 --> 01:50:52.119]  Since 1993, there have been four measles-related deaths.
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:59.387]  Now compare this with 483 claims of injury or death from the measles vaccine.
[01:51:01.525 --> 01:51:07.392]  The government has settled 4.1 billion dollars in vaccine death and injury claims.
[01:51:08.914 --> 01:51:17.263]  According to a New York Times article, the tax on each vaccine is determined by the predicated rate of serious side effects.
[01:51:18.348 --> 01:51:28.213]  In other words, not only is the consumer a test subject for the vaccines, but they also pay for any damages sustained from their use.
[01:51:29.773 --> 01:51:43.180]  Merck, Sharp, and Dome has been fined billions for multiple crimes over the years, including fraud, bribing healthcare professionals, withholding safety information, and exaggerated efficacy rates.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.582]  And yet, thanks to the federal government and taxpayer dollars, they continue to thrive.
[01:51:51.083 --> 01:51:52.103]  Is it all about money?
[01:51:52.123 --> 01:51:54.264]  Or is there something else to it?
[01:51:55.724 --> 01:52:02.927]  During a 2010 TED Talk, Bill Gates suggested that vaccines help reduce the population.
[01:52:03.787 --> 01:52:08.769]  A year later, one of his vaccine campaigns caused 47,500 cases of paralysis and death.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:21.464]  The India Supreme Court claimed that the drug trials being run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were illegal.
[01:52:22.785 --> 01:52:27.127]  Reducing the population has been suggested and supported for years.
[01:52:28.428 --> 01:52:35.272]  Ted Turner told Autobahn Magazine that a total population of 250 to 300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.
[01:52:41.897 --> 01:52:45.258]  This is what the mysterious Georgia Guidestones call for.
[01:52:46.639 --> 01:53:00.685]  When UT professor Eric Pianka came under fire for suggesting that 90% of us should be killed in order to sustain the earth, his students defended him, saying he was being conservative and that everyone should die.
[01:53:03.142 --> 01:53:10.925]  In 2009, Baxter Pharmaceuticals was caught shipping millions of contaminated swine flu vaccinations to 18 countries.
[01:53:11.485 --> 01:53:17.927]  The entire shipment was contaminated with the live H5N1 avian flu virus.
[01:53:19.647 --> 01:53:25.129]  If one wanted to create a pandemic virus, this is one of the easiest ways to do so.
[01:53:26.903 --> 01:53:31.786]  Today, mandatory vaccines are being forced on children in New York.
[01:53:32.727 --> 01:53:41.893]  Government bills are being proposed to remove religious and philosophical exemptions and to exclude unvaccinated children from schools.
[01:53:43.094 --> 01:53:47.477]  But if you question any of this, then you are a crazy anti-vaxxer.
[01:53:48.658 --> 01:53:51.100]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:53:55.462 --> 01:53:59.083]  That is a very powerful report that he produced a week ago.
[01:53:59.103 --> 01:54:02.404]  It fell by the wayside that we never aired.
[01:54:03.304 --> 01:54:03.924]  But we just did.
[01:54:03.944 --> 01:54:06.585]  I'm gonna ask that to be reposted to NewsWars.com.
[01:54:07.265 --> 01:54:08.925]  And why did I say NewsWars.com?
[01:54:09.105 --> 01:54:14.847]  Because it doesn't get blocked on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube as much as InfoWars.com.
[01:54:16.178 --> 01:54:23.740]  InfoWars is a great way in public to get people awake, but online, it's very hard to spread unless it's on your email or on your own personal text.
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:29.301]  That's how we win the information war that the leftists and the globalists are working around the clock to try to block us in.
[01:54:30.582 --> 01:54:36.323]  But sites like NewsWars.com, sites like PrisonPlanet.com, our backup site, are excellent ways to get stuff.
[01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:38.444]  Now, I asked Paul to post more of our stuff.
[01:54:39.144 --> 01:54:42.445]  I'm the one that encouraged him to start his own website.
[01:54:42.465 --> 01:54:43.645]  He started Summit.News.
[01:54:46.052 --> 01:54:48.513]  He's like, but now I like it my own stuff, Alex.
[01:54:49.053 --> 01:54:52.075]  So I'm like, yeah, but you get around the censors more, but they're coming after him.
[01:54:52.795 --> 01:54:55.976]  But he's got a lot of good articles that are on our sites that get out there as well.
[01:54:56.857 --> 01:55:01.599]  But now if I kick Paul out of the nest, then I'm like, come back to the nest sometimes and see Papa.
[01:55:02.599 --> 01:55:05.461]  But, you know, that's happening some.
[01:55:06.801 --> 01:55:07.762]  So it's all up there.
[01:55:07.862 --> 01:55:08.062]  U.S.
[01:55:08.082 --> 01:55:11.503]  Holocaust Museum denounces AOC's comments on concentration camps.
[01:55:13.746 --> 01:55:22.591]  Ilhan incest Omar, married to her brother, said she had three children with him to get into the country so she could bitch about it all day like a Somali pirate boarding her ship.
[01:55:23.812 --> 01:55:26.513]  This little pea brain is really pissed.
[01:55:26.533 --> 01:55:28.515]  In fact, let's play some of that audio.
[01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:30.736]  Walnut brain.
[01:55:31.977 --> 01:55:35.699]  She's probably even stupider than somebody like Nancy Pelosi.
[01:55:36.119 --> 01:55:37.800]  Maybe Nancy Pelosi's stupider, I'm not sure.
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:39.341]  She's probably a bigger walnut brain.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.703]  She has come out and said, what's wrong with a concentration camp?
[01:55:43.743 --> 01:55:45.784]  They're concentrated together.
[01:55:46.445 --> 01:55:56.653]  Concentration camps were invented by the British in most modern history books in the Boer War, right at the turn of the 19th century.
[01:55:57.194 --> 01:55:58.035]  That's not the case.
[01:55:59.356 --> 01:56:03.459]  The first concentration camps were deployed by the British in 1775 in Virginia.
[01:56:08.143 --> 01:56:18.651]  And they would just take people, whole families, when their fathers were fighting, and they would starve the children and the women and their families to death until the men came and gave up.
[01:56:19.752 --> 01:56:26.318]  And Trump's favorite president, Andrew Jackson, read the real history books about him?
[01:56:26.898 --> 01:56:30.201]  It's beyond Conan the Barbarian, but he was super skinny, that's why they called him Old Hickory.
[01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:32.823]  Old Hickory, um,
[01:56:34.232 --> 01:56:37.494]  His mother and brother died in a British concentration camp.
[01:56:37.534 --> 01:56:38.234]  It was called that.
[01:56:38.994 --> 01:56:41.276]  He was a runner from the age of 11 to 15.
[01:56:41.736 --> 01:56:42.476]  Revolutionary War.
[01:56:42.496 --> 01:56:44.557]  Had his law degree after the war at 19.
[01:56:45.318 --> 01:56:46.738]  Was a judge by 20-something.
[01:56:47.419 --> 01:56:50.020]  And, of course, was a leader in the Indian Wars after that.
[01:56:50.941 --> 01:56:52.261]  Shot more than 10 times.
[01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:54.522]  Stabbed with swords more than 10 times.
[01:56:54.542 --> 01:56:58.765]  You know, five or six duels.
[01:56:58.825 --> 01:57:00.766]  Bleed for up to a week with bullet holes in him.
[01:57:00.786 --> 01:57:01.366]  Wouldn't die.
[01:57:01.406 --> 01:57:02.346]  Refused to see doctors.
[01:57:02.527 --> 01:57:03.167]  Yeah, old Hickory.
[01:57:05.376 --> 01:57:08.617]  Don't make them like that, even in the Scott model, anymore.
[01:57:09.658 --> 01:57:14.940]  So, anyways, Trump, a fellow Scott, and a Deutsche, really likes Andrew Jackson.
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:16.481]  But now you know.
[01:57:17.816 --> 01:57:18.717]  The rest of the story.
[01:57:18.817 --> 01:57:29.605]  But here, let's go out to break with Ilhan arrogantly stomping around, bitching at the country that brought her here, all the welfare she got, going, oh yeah, people coming here that we've got to check who they're with.
[01:57:30.346 --> 01:57:33.628]  Let's show photos of Obama era and say they're in a concentration camp.
[01:57:33.668 --> 01:57:34.089]  Here it is.
[01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:35.590]  Hi, could I get a moment of your time?
[01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:42.075]  Could you tell me, do you agree with AOC that ICE is running concentration camps on the border?
[01:57:44.338 --> 01:57:46.644]  There are camps and people are being concentrated.
[01:57:46.664 --> 01:57:47.908]  This is very simple.
[01:57:47.988 --> 01:57:49.713]  I don't even know why this is a controversy.
[01:57:49.733 --> 01:57:51.016]  Who's American hating slug?
[01:57:53.368 --> 01:57:57.591]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on earth.
[01:57:58.231 --> 01:57:59.312]  Clown World.
[01:58:00.753 --> 01:58:04.655]  20 socialist, globalist, communist candidates.
[01:58:05.696 --> 01:58:08.677]  All in one spot for two nights only.
[01:58:09.078 --> 01:58:14.621]  And you're gonna have uncensored, unbridled, pure analysis like no one else can do it.
[01:58:14.981 --> 01:58:17.623]  Clown World, the greatest comedy show on earth.
[01:58:17.903 --> 01:58:21.286]  Two nights only, 20 candidates, and tons of laughs.
[01:58:21.846 --> 01:58:23.587]  June 26th and 27th.
[01:58:23.627 --> 01:58:25.909]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[01:58:26.409 --> 01:58:29.312]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:58:29.992 --> 01:58:31.573]  It's the greatest show on Earth.
[01:58:32.033 --> 01:58:37.475]  A bunch of parasites, bitching and complaining, working for the Chi-Coms to overthrow America.
[01:58:37.936 --> 01:58:44.759]  Join us next Wednesday and Thursday for Clown World, the biggest show on Earth!
[01:58:45.519 --> 01:58:46.580]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.480]  I'm P.T.
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:47.840]  Barnum.
[01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:49.101]  I love the Democrats.
[01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:54.784]  Beto O'Rourke says the world's ending in 11 years and the borders should be open.
[01:58:55.064 --> 01:58:56.345]  There's so many other clowns.
[01:58:56.665 --> 01:59:02.388]  Cory Booker says pay reparations, even if 98% of whites didn't have answers as their own slaves.
[01:59:02.848 --> 01:59:05.029]  And then we move on to Pocahontas.
[01:59:05.289 --> 01:59:08.831]  She's whiter than anybody ever known in history, but it's okay.
[01:59:08.851 --> 01:59:09.572]  She's a fraud.
[01:59:09.872 --> 01:59:10.852]  And then Joe Biden.
[01:59:11.192 --> 01:59:13.934]  Well, Joe Biden loves segregationists and
[01:59:14.394 --> 01:59:17.457]  He wants to put blacks in prison for three times the sentence of whites.
[01:59:17.877 --> 01:59:20.499]  But hey, the Democratic Party loves the KKK!
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:27.525]  And then Swan Oswell, he says, use nuclear weapons on gun owners that don't turn their weapons in.
[01:59:27.906 --> 01:59:33.170]  Bernie Sanders says, it's white people, don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:36.233]  And you've got Buttigieg, oh what a king!
[01:59:36.653 --> 01:59:39.816]  And of course Camilla Ellis and so many others.
[01:59:40.316 --> 01:59:41.617]  It's the greatest show on earth.
[01:59:41.998 --> 01:59:52.407]  Join us this next Wednesday and this next Thursday for coverage of the Democratic Tonight's Debates, the greatest clown show on earth at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:54.749 --> 02:00:00.675]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:37.267]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here broadcasting worldwide and I'm as excited about this as I've ever been excited about anything in my 25 years on air.
[02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:44.314]  James O'Keefe doesn't want to call himself a legend or his great intrepid crew of investigators legends, but they are.
[02:00:45.034 --> 02:00:46.555]  And it's very fair to say
[02:00:47.551 --> 02:00:54.254]  If it wasn't for James O'Keefe and all of you magnifying his great crew's work, and Drudge Report and everybody else, Trump wouldn't be in office.
[02:00:54.654 --> 02:00:57.615]  This country would already be under the rule of people like AOC.
[02:00:58.475 --> 02:01:06.999]  James O'Keefe of ProjectVeritas.com has broken hundreds of stories that have brought the establishment to their knees.
[02:01:07.999 --> 02:01:12.641]  But this latest one, with the head of Google censorship, and the group has an Orwellian name,
[02:01:14.076 --> 02:01:14.917]  Is the biggest yet.
[02:01:15.677 --> 02:01:26.204]  Google executive, and there's a bunch of these people on tape, admits election meddling to prevent Trump winning 2020, brags Congress can pressure us, but we're not changing.
[02:01:27.304 --> 02:01:28.405]  It's a 25-minute report.
[02:01:29.105 --> 02:01:30.486]  It's at ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:01:31.006 --> 02:01:32.266]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:33.187 --> 02:01:34.267]  It's at NewsWars.com.
[02:01:34.287 --> 02:01:35.348]  It's at DrugsReport.com.
[02:01:35.428 --> 02:01:40.991]  I don't care where you get it, but your email, your text messages, that gets past the censors.
[02:01:41.371 --> 02:01:43.292]  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, get it out.
[02:01:43.332 --> 02:01:43.952]  Call Congress.
[02:01:44.232 --> 02:01:44.932]  Call Talk Radio.
[02:01:45.213 --> 02:01:47.614]  This is the total proof and their arrogance.
[02:01:48.294 --> 02:01:50.135]  James O'Keefe just got in the cockpit.
[02:01:50.415 --> 02:01:51.835]  He'll be with us for the next 15 minutes.
[02:01:52.395 --> 02:01:54.096]  James, get right to it.
[02:01:54.536 --> 02:01:56.517]  I believe this is your biggest coup yet.
[02:01:56.877 --> 02:01:59.337]  Because this lady is so high level.
[02:01:59.397 --> 02:02:00.878]  Tell us what's unfolded.
[02:02:01.838 --> 02:02:02.478]  Thanks Alex.
[02:02:02.538 --> 02:02:04.279]  Yeah, it is a 25 minute report.
[02:02:04.999 --> 02:02:06.040]  We uploaded it this morning.
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:07.660]  It's on Drudge and Red.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.641]  And this is a video recording of an insider.
[02:02:11.681 --> 02:02:13.762]  That's someone who currently works for Google.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:15.921]  Blowing the whistle.
[02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:20.685]  It comes on the heels of a story from a Pinterest insider, which I know your audience saw.
[02:02:21.406 --> 02:02:24.208]  So there's this sort of watershed moment where they're all coming forward.
[02:02:24.248 --> 02:02:30.273]  Now, what this video shows is it shows the insider talking about algorithmic unfairness.
[02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:32.114]  That's a term you probably haven't heard before.
[02:02:32.134 --> 02:02:36.318]  The confidential documents, which I have a copy of here and up here in the video.
[02:02:36.818 --> 02:02:38.199]  And I'm going to read from the document.
[02:02:38.279 --> 02:02:43.924]  It says, quote, in some cases, it may be appropriate to take no action if the system, that's Google,
[02:02:44.546 --> 02:02:45.746]  Accurately affects reality.
[02:02:45.786 --> 02:02:53.589]  While in other cases, it may be desirable to consider how we might help society reach a more fair and equitable state via product intervention.
[02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:57.830]  So these documents show algorithmic unfairness.
[02:02:58.310 --> 02:03:08.374]  The executive named Janai on the secret recording obtained by Project Veritas shows how they want to affect the 2020 election outcome.
[02:03:08.434 --> 02:03:10.494]  So all these things corroborate each other.
[02:03:11.114 --> 02:03:12.675]  It is a huge story, Alex.
[02:03:13.351 --> 02:03:19.813]  An insider, whistleblower, secret recordings of the executives inside of Google, and the documents.
[02:03:20.053 --> 02:03:32.277]  And it shows Google's efforts to basically augment reality, and to quote the Google documents, basically have an impact on the masses to get the agenda they want.
[02:03:33.433 --> 02:03:37.057]  James, when I got up this morning and saw this, nothing gives me butterflies.
[02:03:37.357 --> 02:03:38.598]  Nothing gives me short of breath.
[02:03:38.658 --> 02:03:43.703]  I almost had an anxiety attack on how in the hell am I going to make a big enough deal about this.
[02:03:44.143 --> 02:03:46.826]  And then a text message came in from the producer, oh, we've got James O'Keefe.
[02:03:47.347 --> 02:03:49.288]  I was like, because I want to beat these people.
[02:03:49.469 --> 02:03:50.470]  And we know they've been doing it.
[02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:51.631]  You've caught them a bunch yourself.
[02:03:51.931 --> 02:03:52.471]  We've caught them.
[02:03:53.072 --> 02:03:53.773]  They brag about it.
[02:03:54.173 --> 02:03:58.955]  And now you've got, like, the Holy Grail, the Rosetta Stone, the Skeleton Key.
[02:03:59.275 --> 02:04:00.295]  I mean, she's on there.
[02:04:00.396 --> 02:04:01.856]  Others are on there just admitting it.
[02:04:02.196 --> 02:04:03.917]  And this term, product intervention.
[02:04:04.317 --> 02:04:08.479]  Sundar is up before Congress, eight months ago, saying, we don't intervene in anything.
[02:04:08.499 --> 02:04:10.860]  I mean, the perjury alone.
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:17.963]  Yeah, and one of the things that this Jenai, Jen Janai, who's the head of Google Innovation, says, you just showed the quote.
[02:04:18.603 --> 02:04:19.903]  She said that we're not changing.
[02:04:20.003 --> 02:04:21.404]  Congress can pressure us, but we're not
[02:04:22.028 --> 02:04:23.869]  We don't want to show up, then we're not changing.
[02:04:24.349 --> 02:04:31.591]  So I think one of the things the insider told me was how, there he is, Congress can pressure us, but we're not changing.
[02:04:32.391 --> 02:04:45.495]  And she specifically says that Liz Warren, she says, I like Liz Warren, but Liz Warren has some problems because if they break Google up, says this Jenjani, then small companies won't be able to stop Trump.
[02:04:45.515 --> 02:04:46.175]  But we can!
[02:04:46.856 --> 02:04:51.217]  We can prevent, a big company can prevent Trump's situation, whereas smaller companies cannot.
[02:04:51.724 --> 02:04:57.909]  So the issue is, Alex, that Google is classified as a platform.
[02:04:57.929 --> 02:04:58.630]  I understand.
[02:04:58.650 --> 02:04:59.451]  Section 230.
[02:04:59.531 --> 02:04:59.891]  Back in 60.
[02:05:00.352 --> 02:05:01.733]  James O'Keefe, the legend.
[02:05:09.437 --> 02:05:12.318]  Announcing the greatest show on earth!

[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:27.061]  The Democratic Party's two-night extravaganza debate!
[02:05:27.341 --> 02:05:28.902]  Let's meet the candidates!
[02:05:29.782 --> 02:05:30.562]  All-Star!
[02:05:30.722 --> 02:05:32.183]  Beto O'Rourke!
[02:05:32.363 --> 02:05:33.123]  Oh my gosh!
[02:05:33.183 --> 02:05:34.244]  Cory Booker!
[02:05:34.704 --> 02:05:35.964]  The Amazing!
[02:05:36.084 --> 02:05:36.285]  Oh!
[02:05:36.385 --> 02:05:37.685]  Pocahontas!
[02:05:38.305 --> 02:05:39.666]  Joe Biden!
[02:05:40.166 --> 02:05:41.266]  Swallow's Whale Sizzle!
[02:05:41.366 --> 02:05:42.347]  New Gun Owners!
[02:05:42.807 --> 02:05:42.947]  Yay!
[02:05:43.327 --> 02:05:44.988]  Bernie Sanders!
[02:05:45.108 --> 02:05:46.588]  Love the Soviet Union!
[02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:48.149]  Camilla Harris!
[02:05:48.329 --> 02:05:49.590]  And so many more!
[02:05:50.050 --> 02:05:51.390]  It's the greatest show on Earth!
[02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:55.512]  Head to polewars.com forward slash show with live coverage next week!
[02:05:56.372 --> 02:05:59.573]  Okay, I've been interviewing James O'Keefe for
[02:06:25.127 --> 02:06:50.190]  Ten years since he blew up an acorn And I've seen all the devastating victories and then tried to indict him and their failures but To sit here and have him have the head of Google censorship With this weird Orwellian name of the office caught in undercover video you realize how hard it is to get this to penetrate to infiltrate this is
[02:06:51.508 --> 02:06:55.792]  Like the Allies in 1941 getting the Enigma Code from the Nazis, okay?
[02:06:56.512 --> 02:07:00.676]  If Congress and the President don't act, then they must be complicit, which we know Trump isn't.
[02:07:01.817 --> 02:07:06.841]  But his underlings are bought off by Google and keep, you know, he's not lobbying and taking lobbying money, but they are.
[02:07:07.301 --> 02:07:08.462]  This has gone to the President.
[02:07:08.882 --> 02:07:10.023]  It needs to go mega-viral.
[02:07:10.063 --> 02:07:13.746]  It's at DrugsReport.com, Infowars.com, ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:07:13.947 --> 02:07:14.307]  Get it out.
[02:07:14.327 --> 02:07:15.448]  25-minute report.
[02:07:17.475 --> 02:07:20.077]  Total evidence of Google election meddling in 2020.
[02:07:20.338 --> 02:07:21.198]  Trump must act now.
[02:07:22.239 --> 02:07:23.700]  Reddit blocks Project Veritas.
[02:07:23.721 --> 02:07:26.023]  The group exposes Google election meddling.
[02:07:26.103 --> 02:07:28.024]  Insider blows whistle on exec.
[02:07:28.064 --> 02:07:30.767]  Reveals Google plan to prevent Trump situation 2020.
[02:07:30.807 --> 02:07:33.129]  They are scared of this.
[02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:35.671]  This is kryptonite to their fraud.
[02:07:37.739 --> 02:07:39.119]  We've got eight and a half minutes until we're at break.
[02:07:39.139 --> 02:07:39.780]  You've got to go.
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:40.720]  You've got the floor.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:44.561]  Am I right in saying this is probably the most important thing you've ever broken?
[02:07:44.581 --> 02:07:46.121]  This is the total proof.
[02:07:46.221 --> 02:07:48.642]  Oh, this is by far the biggest thing we ever broke.
[02:07:48.662 --> 02:07:50.403]  I mean, a lot of people are thinking, what's going to happen?
[02:07:50.423 --> 02:07:51.843]  Well, first of all, the story just came out.
[02:07:52.583 --> 02:07:54.104]  I think Congress is going to hold hearings.
[02:07:54.124 --> 02:07:58.605]  The lawmakers are telling me, sort of here, they're texting me, we're going to have hearings in July.
[02:07:59.289 --> 02:08:05.416]  But, I mean, the video is 25 minutes long, so, I mean, I've only got about 8 minutes, so let me just try to get through some of the facts here and maybe talk about it.
[02:08:05.996 --> 02:08:09.140]  I'm not one to characterize people, I'm just gonna quote them, okay, Alex?
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.321]  I'm not gonna characterize them.
[02:08:11.593 --> 02:08:15.794]  That man in the shadow you see, the insider, is a current Google employee.
[02:08:16.294 --> 02:08:22.636]  And one of the things he said to me when I was interviewing him, he said, James, people would think this is a conspiracy theory if it weren't for the documents.
[02:08:23.216 --> 02:08:25.877]  And one of the documents he gave me says, I'm going to quote them.
[02:08:25.917 --> 02:08:28.277]  This is Google, not me, not you.
[02:08:28.477 --> 02:08:32.378]  It says, it says, quote, training data are collected and classified.
[02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:33.619]  Algorithms are programmed.
[02:08:33.759 --> 02:08:36.339]  Media are filtered, ranked, aggregated and generated.
[02:08:36.699 --> 02:08:38.540]  People like us are programmed.
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:39.841]  That's a direct quote.
[02:08:39.921 --> 02:08:42.542]  People like us are programmed.
[02:08:43.443 --> 02:08:52.968]  And one of the things that this executive says is that people who believe and agree with President Trump will not like our definition of, quote, fairness.
[02:08:53.028 --> 02:08:54.909]  That's Jen Janai, the woman you're looking at right there.
[02:08:55.269 --> 02:08:58.591]  People who voted for the current president do not agree with our definition of fairness.
[02:08:58.611 --> 02:09:02.974]  So what's interesting, Alex, is that Google is saying here that they're able to define
[02:09:03.942 --> 02:09:09.111]  Fairness, and this algorithmic unfairness, and they have product intervention.
[02:09:09.131 --> 02:09:10.995]  So what the Google insider did is he sat down with me.
[02:09:11.545 --> 02:09:15.368]  And he googled Hillary Clinton's emails, just the phrase.
[02:09:15.908 --> 02:09:17.809]  And you can do it right now at your home computer.
[02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:21.491]  And it doesn't autocomplete, even though millions of people search for that.
[02:09:21.892 --> 02:09:27.635]  But then he typed in Donald Trump's emails, and it did autocomplete, even though very few people search for that.
[02:09:28.116 --> 02:09:36.381]  So Google is actually meddling in an election by virtue of defining what is fair and what is not fair, and they would never admit this publicly.
[02:09:37.026 --> 02:09:41.109]  And right now, they're in a huge world of trouble because that is not a low-level ranking employee.
[02:09:41.129 --> 02:09:43.211]  That is the head of their entire innovation department.
[02:09:43.791 --> 02:09:48.455]  And she, as well as Gorov Gite, corroborated the Google algorithmic unfairness document.
[02:09:48.475 --> 02:09:51.437]  Now, Alex, one thing I must tell you... And that's the censorship.
[02:09:51.737 --> 02:09:53.078]  That's the censorship blueprint.
[02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:57.582]  She's the head of innovation, which is ending the old algorithm, what's popular, going to censorship.
[02:09:58.311 --> 02:10:08.574]  I mean, you couldn't get better descriptors for the names of the departments if you went to Orwell or the protagonist Winston in 1984 who edits out, remember that movie where he edits out all the newspapers?
[02:10:08.594 --> 02:10:10.254]  Yeah, Ministry of Truth is the Ministry of Lies.
[02:10:10.274 --> 02:10:11.115]  Ministry of Truth.
[02:10:11.495 --> 02:10:16.516]  I mean, this document's called Definition of Algorithmic Unfairness.
[02:10:16.936 --> 02:10:19.077]  It's labeled privileged and confidential.
[02:10:19.137 --> 02:10:22.158]  Now, many of you are wondering, wow, these people are real heroes for blowing the whistle.
[02:10:22.618 --> 02:10:24.020]  Hell yeah, they're heroes.
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:26.622]  They make a lot of money and they don't care.
[02:10:26.642 --> 02:10:32.368]  And one of the things he said, the man in the silhouette there who works for Google, he said, I'm nothing but an ant.
[02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:35.632]  He says, I'm just, I'm going after Goliath here.
[02:10:36.112 --> 02:10:37.093]  And I said, are you scared?
[02:10:37.113 --> 02:10:37.674]  Are you frightened?
[02:10:37.694 --> 02:10:38.815]  He said, you know what?
[02:10:38.995 --> 02:10:41.558]  I hope I get away with it, but there are some things bigger than me.
[02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:42.830]  He said this to me.
[02:10:42.850 --> 02:10:43.191]  Beautiful.
[02:10:43.331 --> 02:10:46.892]  He said, there are some things bigger than me, and you know what's happened in the last few hours?
[02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:49.654]  I've already had a dozen more people email me.
[02:10:50.094 --> 02:10:59.538]  And I think you're seeing a watershed moment right now, right here today, as I sit here, where people are going to come forward, Alex, because they want the people to know what's going on.
[02:11:00.499 --> 02:11:01.399]  You said it, James.
[02:11:01.459 --> 02:11:02.560]  It's not hype.
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:03.660]  You can feel the history.
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:04.841]  This is watershed.
[02:11:05.766 --> 02:11:09.291]  And all the whistleblowers, it's now just cascading.
[02:11:09.591 --> 02:11:15.800]  And you look at the arrogance of their head of censorship under this Orwellian term, and she goes, it doesn't matter what Congress does.
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:20.025]  Well, you notice Sundar wouldn't even go to Congress a year ago and testify.
[02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:28.074]  And then they gave all the secrets that the Pentagon had given them to the Chinese with their dragonfly operation, their censorship office, and their AI project.
[02:11:28.695 --> 02:11:37.324]  And then now suddenly they're having to grovel a bit at the executive level, but still their employees, like you said, are programmed cult members still carrying this out.
[02:11:37.384 --> 02:11:38.165]  This is incredible.
[02:11:38.886 --> 02:11:39.767]  Their word's not yours.
[02:11:39.787 --> 02:11:39.987]  They say...
[02:11:42.202 --> 02:11:43.863]  That they're trying to quote program the people.
[02:11:43.923 --> 02:11:52.130]  And one of the things that Jani says is the reasons we launched the Artificial Intelligence Principles, there it is, ML Fairness, is because people were not putting that line in the sand.
[02:11:52.530 --> 02:11:54.852]  That they were not saying what's fair and what's equitable.
[02:11:55.232 --> 02:11:58.294]  So we're like, we're a big company, we're going to say it.
[02:11:58.355 --> 02:12:01.157]  So what Jani is saying is don't bust us up, Elizabeth Warren.
[02:12:01.397 --> 02:12:03.579]  By the way, I'm anxious to see what Elizabeth Warren has to say about this.
[02:12:03.839 --> 02:12:07.341]  Because she's being attacked by this Google executive.
[02:12:07.562 --> 02:12:09.123]  What they're saying is don't break us up.
[02:12:09.603 --> 02:12:13.566]  Don't get involved, Antitrust, because we need to stay the Leviathan.
[02:12:13.606 --> 02:12:18.450]  We need to be large, such that we can continue to define what is real.
[02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:25.436]  He's saying we need to be the big global monopoly to bully these evil conservatives that don't want to sexualize their five-year-olds or open the borders.
[02:12:26.499 --> 02:12:30.780]  Yes, she's saying, keep us large so that we can change the outcome.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:33.861]  If 2016 happened again, would the outcome be different?
[02:12:33.881 --> 02:12:34.841]  I love you guys, producer.
[02:12:34.881 --> 02:12:36.121]  Your producers are so fast.
[02:12:36.161 --> 02:12:37.622]  You pull it up as soon as I'm bringing it up.
[02:12:38.042 --> 02:12:42.563]  If the algorithms happened again, would we have a different outcome than 2016?
[02:12:43.023 --> 02:12:43.783]  That's the quote.
[02:12:44.103 --> 02:12:46.604]  And Alex, I think there's going to be hearings as a result of this.
[02:12:46.944 --> 02:12:48.304]  I think there's going to be whistleblowers.
[02:12:48.784 --> 02:12:51.765]  I think, and I'm really sincere, I've known you for 9, 10 years.
[02:12:51.845 --> 02:12:52.905]  I don't think you think.
[02:12:52.925 --> 02:12:53.906]  The dam has broken.
[02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:55.286]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:56.254 --> 02:13:00.276]  I really think this is the moment that we have been waiting for.
[02:13:00.316 --> 02:13:01.636]  We're the heroes amongst us.
[02:13:02.177 --> 02:13:06.378]  Because it's one thing, Alex, if I infiltrate or I go undercover, this is them.
[02:13:06.398 --> 02:13:09.359]  This is them giving us the information.
[02:13:09.799 --> 02:13:13.521]  So I'm just really excited and I know there's going to be more news to break.
[02:13:13.761 --> 02:13:14.141]  No, I agree.
[02:13:14.201 --> 02:13:23.565]  Remember two years ago, you brought it out and it later came out in the news, Google is more afraid of whistleblowers than anybody and is running NSA level spying on their own people.
[02:13:24.608 --> 02:13:29.009]  I think what we really need, though, is we need people to contact Google.
[02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:31.390]  Your listeners are all, what can I do?
[02:13:31.410 --> 02:13:31.870]  What can I do?
[02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:40.773]  Well, other than blow the whistle inside a company, I think, and you can do that by sending us an encrypted email, VeritasTipsAtProtonMail.com.
[02:13:41.234 --> 02:13:45.315]  But, what I think what we need to do is, I think if you just press
[02:13:46.161 --> 02:13:51.368]  I don't have the email just in front of me, but the press office at Google, we've got to email them and get a comment.
[02:13:51.388 --> 02:13:53.050]  We've got to get a statement from Google about this.
[02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:53.951]  We've got to get a reaction.
[02:13:54.592 --> 02:13:59.658]  Well, they're going to try to cover this up, but internally this is going to run through all their employees, and they know they're in a cult.
[02:14:00.458 --> 02:14:01.919]  They know it's getting more out of control.
[02:14:01.999 --> 02:14:02.740]  Let's shift the minutes.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:03.000]  We have 11.
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:03.961]  Please come back soon.
[02:14:03.981 --> 02:14:04.822]  I know you're working very hard.
[02:14:05.142 --> 02:14:06.703]  James O'Keefe at ProjectVirtus.com.
[02:14:07.263 --> 02:14:10.126]  The audience here can override the AI, and that's why you're here.
[02:14:10.166 --> 02:14:14.449]  The audience has to email this, Facebook it, call talk radio, call C-SPAN, call the White House.
[02:14:14.789 --> 02:14:16.691]  Trump has to act now on this.
[02:14:16.811 --> 02:14:19.493]  I mean, this, like you said, congressional hearings coming in July.
[02:14:19.854 --> 02:14:22.476]  You've got Congress people calling you, obviously senators calling you.
[02:14:22.896 --> 02:14:24.817]  You have given them the motherload.
[02:14:24.858 --> 02:14:28.781]  This is like Al Capone being caught, you know, with dead bodies.
[02:14:29.537 --> 02:14:30.678]  But most people are on the take.
[02:14:30.798 --> 02:14:31.318]  I mean, right?
[02:14:31.398 --> 02:14:34.520]  The New York Times is supposed to be no fear or favor.
[02:14:34.941 --> 02:14:41.225]  The bottom line is most people in this country are either afraid or they are on the take that Google is such a powerful company.
[02:14:41.883 --> 02:14:50.872]  I mean, most people are afraid to publish a story about a company that can censor and define their income, because most distribution happens through the social media companies.
[02:14:51.293 --> 02:14:53.475]  So Project Veritas does not have any advertisers.
[02:14:54.216 --> 02:14:55.217]  I can't be boycotted.
[02:14:55.257 --> 02:14:56.498]  I can't be bought or sold.
[02:14:56.818 --> 02:14:58.560]  I refuse to compromise on my principles.
[02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:00.622]  I refuse to settle lawsuits, Alex.
[02:15:00.662 --> 02:15:01.843]  I've won five lawsuits.
[02:15:02.204 --> 02:15:05.047]  I'll go all the way to a jury verdict, which I did, and I won.
[02:15:05.727 --> 02:15:10.710]  And I think that people are... the Goliath fears the little guy if the little guy stands on principle, right?
[02:15:10.730 --> 02:15:16.774]  Well, I gotta say in these games, if people want to see a thoroughbred Americana hero and a crew that have gone through the fire, you're it.
[02:15:17.254 --> 02:15:18.175]  InfoWars has done it.
[02:15:18.275 --> 02:15:18.995]  Only a few others.
[02:15:19.115 --> 02:15:19.976]  You are the example.
[02:15:20.496 --> 02:15:24.739]  And we just salute you and thank you for all your courage and everything you've done.
[02:15:24.919 --> 02:15:29.422]  And I guess you've got even... I'm told... you told me a few months ago, I got really big stuff coming.
[02:15:30.182 --> 02:15:30.902]  What else is coming?
[02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:31.283]  Big stuff?
[02:15:32.604 --> 02:15:35.546]  All these people are coming to me in the last 24 hours.
[02:15:35.626 --> 02:15:36.606]  More insiders.
[02:15:36.646 --> 02:15:43.450]  Yes, I just learned last night there's another person in the company that wants to come forward.
[02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:45.131]  It doesn't get better than that.
[02:15:45.211 --> 02:15:47.772]  VeritasTipsAtProtonMail.com.
[02:15:48.653 --> 02:15:54.876]  I urge you, if you work for one of these organizations and you do want to tell the truth to people, contact us.
[02:15:54.916 --> 02:15:55.477]  We'll work with you.
[02:15:55.857 --> 02:15:57.137]  James, fabulous.
[02:15:57.498 --> 02:15:59.018]  I admire you and your whole crew.
[02:15:59.179 --> 02:16:00.859]  You are the blood of freedom.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:01.500]  We salute you.
[02:16:09.986 --> 02:16:12.408]  So here's Lefto, but there's good news!
[02:16:13.969 --> 02:16:20.635]  I don't just come on air, willy-nilly, without something to offer ya!
[02:16:21.376 --> 02:16:26.100]  Not only is Lefto the Clown here live for this segment, but I got good news!
[02:16:27.121 --> 02:16:28.102]  You see, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:16:30.379 --> 02:16:33.360]  Lefto the Clown has friends out there in the political community.
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:35.481]  A lot of them are in the government.
[02:16:35.801 --> 02:16:41.323]  And some of them want to be President of the United States!
[02:16:42.823 --> 02:16:43.523]  That's right!
[02:16:44.384 --> 02:16:49.345]  Some of Lefto's buddies are running for President of the United States!
[02:16:50.285 --> 02:16:54.647]  Now I know you're out there probably jumping for joy, but hold your horses!
[02:16:55.666 --> 02:16:59.128]  Because there's even more to be excited about!
[02:17:00.069 --> 02:17:09.614]  Not just that Lefto's friends are running for president, but that next week, they will be hosting a clown show!
[02:17:10.655 --> 02:17:11.775]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:17:12.256 --> 02:17:17.139]  Next week, the Democrats are having their first presidential debates!
[02:17:18.251 --> 02:17:19.552]  And you know what that means!
[02:17:20.153 --> 02:17:22.154]  It's the Clown World Show!
[02:17:22.214 --> 02:17:24.116]  The greatest comedy show on Earth!
[02:17:24.556 --> 02:17:26.057]  The first Democrat debate!
[02:17:26.778 --> 02:17:39.107]  But ladies and gentlemen, we're so committed to your entertainment, we're so committed to you getting the full picture, we're so committed to the Clown World, we're gonna stake it up a bit.
[02:17:40.188 --> 02:17:44.331]  Not only do we have one night,
[02:17:45.419 --> 02:17:55.349]  Of Presidential Democrat Debates, we give you two nights of The Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth, and the best news is yet to come!
[02:17:56.550 --> 02:18:01.696]  It's all gonna be streamed live at infowars.com slash show!
[02:18:04.707 --> 02:18:05.708]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[02:18:05.948 --> 02:18:07.448]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:18:07.529 --> 02:18:07.869]  Hello.
[02:18:08.029 --> 02:18:12.291]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Pollen Block.
[02:18:12.431 --> 02:18:13.772]  It's amazing.
[02:18:13.892 --> 02:18:19.635]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever, and the antihistamines
[02:18:20.035 --> 02:18:23.997]  Sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quite work fully.
[02:18:24.017 --> 02:18:29.019]  They don't block all the symptoms, they just kind of dry you up, or at least that's what they do for me, if they work at all.
[02:18:29.039 --> 02:18:30.540]  But hold and block, it works.
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:31.701]  It stops everything.
[02:18:31.821 --> 02:18:35.823]  I don't get the itchy eyes, I'm not sneezing, and I don't get the irritation.
[02:18:35.843 --> 02:18:36.703]  It is amazing.
[02:18:36.823 --> 02:18:39.064]  This is a known patent out of France.
[02:18:39.084 --> 02:18:49.728]  They have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[02:18:49.928 --> 02:18:52.289]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:55.930]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[02:18:56.050 --> 02:18:56.751]  It just works.
[02:18:56.951 --> 02:19:07.475]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[02:19:07.535 --> 02:19:10.096]  Pollen Block works every single time.
[02:19:10.196 --> 02:19:11.296]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:14.737]  And for whatever reason, it's this thing that France discovered like 50 years ago.
[02:19:14.757 --> 02:19:17.058]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[02:19:17.118 --> 02:19:18.118]  It's very complex.
[02:19:18.138 --> 02:19:18.958]  They don't even know why.
[02:19:18.998 --> 02:19:22.279]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[02:19:22.879 --> 02:19:29.501]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:31.381]  I go out and I do market research.
[02:19:31.521 --> 02:19:33.962]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[02:19:34.142 --> 02:19:35.482]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[02:19:35.802 --> 02:19:43.944]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[02:19:43.984 --> 02:19:45.625]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[02:19:45.705 --> 02:19:50.906]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[02:19:51.447 --> 02:19:52.007]  It's not here.
[02:19:52.427 --> 02:19:55.848]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[02:19:55.908 --> 02:19:57.228]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:20:05.828 --> 02:20:11.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.834 --> 02:20:29.498]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:32.333 --> 02:20:39.579]  The reason why I decided to come to Project Veritas is because people need to know what's actually going on with Google.
[02:20:39.659 --> 02:20:47.105]  There's this fraud about what they're doing, but what they're actually doing, what the employees are actually seeing inside the company, is different.
[02:20:47.125 --> 02:20:51.688]  The reason we launched our AI principles was because people were not putting that line in the sand.
[02:20:51.708 --> 02:20:53.890]  They were not saying, it's fair, it's ethical.
[02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:56.572]  So we're like, well, we are a big company, we're going to say it.
[02:20:56.592 --> 02:20:59.975]  The people who voted for the current president do not agree.
[02:21:01.994 --> 02:21:03.516]  They're not an objective piece.
[02:21:04.016 --> 02:21:06.038]  They're not an objective source of information.
[02:21:06.438 --> 02:21:11.363]  But then there are things, you know, which are called ML Fairness.
[02:21:11.663 --> 02:21:12.664]  ML Fairness, it seems.
[02:21:12.684 --> 02:21:13.125]  Fairness.
[02:21:13.365 --> 02:21:13.505]  Yeah.
[02:21:13.525 --> 02:21:14.726]  You know, you need to be fair.
[02:21:14.986 --> 02:21:19.611]  We're also training our algorithms, like, if 2016 happens again, would we
[02:21:20.611 --> 02:21:30.898]  They are a highly biased political machine that is bent on never letting somebody like Donald Trump come to power again.
[02:21:31.138 --> 02:21:33.519]  This is a Goliath I invented.
[02:21:43.456 --> 02:21:45.897]  I'm trying to say that the emperor has no clothes.
[02:21:52.621 --> 02:21:56.383]  Being a small little ant, I can be crushed and I'm aware of that.
[02:21:57.003 --> 02:21:59.064]  But this is something that is bigger than me.
[02:21:59.124 --> 02:22:02.546]  This is something that needs to be said to the American public.
[02:22:03.206 --> 02:22:06.909]  Elizabeth Warren is saying that we should break up Google.
[02:22:07.049 --> 02:22:08.490]  I love her, but she is very misguided.
[02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:10.551]  Like, that will not make it better.
[02:22:10.631 --> 02:22:18.176]  It will make it worse, because now all these smaller companies who don't have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation.
[02:22:18.316 --> 02:22:23.240]  It's like a small company cannot do that.
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:23.720]  Mwah!
[02:22:35.310 --> 02:22:35.910]  I like it.
[02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:43.232]  Hey, by the way, in space no one can hear you scream, you can't hear explosions either.
[02:22:43.252 --> 02:22:53.374]  Let me tell you something, Congress and the Pentagon, that arrogant president of censorship running her mouth is the final freaking nail.
[02:22:53.995 --> 02:22:59.296]  Because there's things bigger than money in Congress, and little chicken necks running their mouths about stealing elections.
[02:23:01.636 --> 02:23:03.437]  You're not putting it back together, Humpty Dumpty.
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:07.081]  That's Death Star destruction level.
[02:23:07.981 --> 02:23:13.003]  That doesn't mean we've won the war, but we just blew the living snot out of him.
[02:23:13.643 --> 02:23:15.063]  They've tried to indict O'Keefe.
[02:23:16.424 --> 02:23:17.064]  They've sued him.
[02:23:17.124 --> 02:23:18.065]  He hasn't backed down.
[02:23:18.225 --> 02:23:20.825]  And there's a lot of other folks in the same boat as us.
[02:23:20.966 --> 02:23:21.546]  O'Keefe's hit.
[02:23:22.386 --> 02:23:27.508]  And so I admire what he's done, and I hope you financially support him, because he's gone through hell.
[02:23:27.528 --> 02:23:28.108]  But he loves it.
[02:23:28.128 --> 02:23:29.789]  He's gotten so much stronger over the years.
[02:23:31.049 --> 02:23:33.550]  He's gotten so much more eloquent and focused, just like we have.
[02:23:34.642 --> 02:23:36.944]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[02:23:36.964 --> 02:23:42.429]  If you want to use the analogy of your radio listener, you can't see this, but Gollum wants the ring.
[02:23:42.449 --> 02:23:43.370]  He goes after the power.
[02:23:43.410 --> 02:23:46.152]  He falls into the crack of doom where the ring was forged.
[02:23:47.093 --> 02:23:47.854]  Let's show that part.
[02:23:47.874 --> 02:23:48.294]  Back it up.
[02:23:49.075 --> 02:23:53.379]  And boy, finally, that big old eye blows up.
[02:23:57.642 --> 02:24:00.365]  It is a very, very exciting time.
[02:24:02.438 --> 02:24:02.978]  To be alive.
[02:24:03.558 --> 02:24:15.821]  And it doesn't mean that there's a lot of evil running around, and it doesn't mean things aren't really bad, but the tide is starting to turn, and the globalists know it, and they don't know what to do.
[02:24:16.701 --> 02:24:19.441]  So that eye, when Hillary lost, said, oh, it's Jones!
[02:24:20.362 --> 02:24:27.223]  It's James O'Keefe, it's Drudge, it's Trump, it's his sons, it's his... No, it's people not wanting to live under you.
[02:24:30.144 --> 02:24:31.824]  And you're not going to be able to put
[02:24:32.745 --> 02:24:35.806]  The genie back in the bottle, sweetheart.
[02:24:38.507 --> 02:24:39.827]  Because there's one thing about leftists.
[02:24:40.788 --> 02:24:42.228]  They are trained at universities.
[02:24:42.508 --> 02:24:44.209]  They are the ruling class.
[02:24:44.989 --> 02:24:46.209]  And they're gonna rule.
[02:24:47.390 --> 02:24:58.293]  And the minute they try to go out and rule people that are auto mechanics and police officers and people that own pool companies or restaurants or
[02:25:00.279 --> 02:25:14.585]  Machine factories, or farmers, or ranchers, or... The minute they try to go out and rule all these people that don't want to rule anybody, you're going to find out who knows how to work hard, who knows how to overpower you, who knows how to infiltrate you.
[02:25:14.865 --> 02:25:18.006]  We will destroy you, politically.
[02:25:19.587 --> 02:25:22.628]  So you better sit there, and you better double down.
[02:25:22.968 --> 02:25:27.010]  Let me tell you something, all your lies, at the end of the day, have only made us stronger.
[02:25:28.274 --> 02:25:36.457]  I'm not like you, where I believe in fantasy land, so if you say the most worst things about me all over every TV station everywhere, I walk with my head high.
[02:25:37.938 --> 02:25:44.301]  And I was in downtown Austin to see my middle daughter doing a music show.
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:53.384]  And I've never shook so many hands or had so many liberals or leftists come up to me and they said, I used to hate you, but I looked at what you said and thought it was truer.
[02:25:53.704 --> 02:25:57.025]  I saw that latest thing and I was kind of on the fence, but that's a lie.
[02:25:57.045 --> 02:25:58.386]  I said, it's okay.
[02:25:58.446 --> 02:25:58.926]  It's all right.
[02:25:59.386 --> 02:26:03.768]  They have attacked us and lied about us so much that it just made us stronger!
[02:26:05.709 --> 02:26:07.630]  And that's this incredible, real alchemy.
[02:26:09.022 --> 02:26:13.343]  They want to lie and cheat and steal and do all this stuff to us.
[02:26:14.183 --> 02:26:16.943]  And they thought we were bullied by them, but we were asleep.
[02:26:18.964 --> 02:26:19.824]  And now we're awake.
[02:26:22.304 --> 02:26:24.665]  So it's an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:26.125 --> 02:26:28.005]  And you're going to see amazing things happen.
[02:26:28.145 --> 02:26:33.206]  Oh, Antifa says on this big July 4th parade, they're going to attack the July 4th parade.
[02:26:33.886 --> 02:26:36.767]  They're calling for attacking it, attacking anyone with American flags.
[02:26:38.171 --> 02:26:42.313]  Trump's having a Salute to America event outside the White House.
[02:26:42.433 --> 02:26:43.433]  It's $5 for each person.
[02:26:44.594 --> 02:26:47.716]  They vowed to attack that and keep anybody from getting into it.
[02:26:49.736 --> 02:26:53.138]  But the media will show the event before it opens and say no one was there, just like 2016.
[02:26:53.278 --> 02:26:56.800]  It wasn't that Trump cared about the crowd size, which was record.
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:27:03.323]  He cared about that the whole media would lie and show a photo before the gates opened to the Commons.
[02:27:04.906 --> 02:27:05.506]  To the monument.
[02:27:06.487 --> 02:27:07.008]  The mall.
[02:27:08.149 --> 02:27:09.610]  And he was just like, they're that bad?
[02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:14.694]  And it's a process for all of us to go through just how bad they are.
[02:27:15.875 --> 02:27:17.036]  And just how much they'll lie.
[02:27:17.556 --> 02:27:21.239]  And for them, they're on the air saying Trump's a Nazi.
[02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:22.500]  Concentration camps.
[02:27:22.921 --> 02:27:27.064]  Trump's election was like JFK and RFK and MLK being killed.
[02:27:27.424 --> 02:27:32.729]  And the lies just get crazier and more ridiculous and more stupid and more insane.
[02:27:34.468 --> 02:27:37.629]  Because they don't have any truth.
[02:27:38.410 --> 02:27:41.851]  They're just the globalists that got put in to sell us out to foreign powers.
[02:27:42.611 --> 02:27:45.512]  But the minute we woke up to that, we started putting our own people back in.
[02:27:45.872 --> 02:27:46.873]  Doesn't mean they're angels.
[02:27:47.113 --> 02:27:47.853]  Doesn't mean they're perfect.
[02:27:47.873 --> 02:27:48.393]  But you know what?
[02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:51.014]  They weren't born and bred to piss on the country.
[02:27:51.635 --> 02:27:53.695]  They weren't born and bred to hate capitalism.
[02:27:53.855 --> 02:27:56.456]  They weren't born and bred to hate somebody else because they had something.
[02:27:57.897 --> 02:28:00.618]  They were born and bred to end slavery and try to end racism.
[02:28:00.658 --> 02:28:03.139]  They were born and bred to empower women like nobody else did.
[02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:09.231]  So at the time of hating ourselves and being told we're pieces of crap, it's coming to an end.
[02:28:09.251 --> 02:28:13.992]  I want to air some special reports when we come back, and then Gerald Saliente's taking over.
[02:28:14.052 --> 02:28:16.153]  But yeah, we'll play this Ilhan Omar that I haven't gotten to.
[02:28:16.193 --> 02:28:17.174]  Just the arrogance!
[02:28:17.794 --> 02:28:22.715]  Because she makes up for the fact that she comes from a country of slavery, where her own people enslaved women.
[02:28:23.236 --> 02:28:25.897]  And she came here illegally, and married her brother, and reportedly had three children with him.
[02:28:26.177 --> 02:28:32.439]  And all she's got is her arrogance telling you how much you suck all day, and how you owe her something!
[02:28:34.821 --> 02:28:35.321]  We're on a break.
[02:28:35.341 --> 02:28:36.682]  We're coming back with it.
[02:28:36.842 --> 02:28:40.404]  And then, some special reports we've not aired that are so good, we gotta air them.
[02:28:41.645 --> 02:28:44.447]  Meanwhile, you can get to Paul Watson's latest report on Infowars.com.
[02:28:46.188 --> 02:28:51.411]  The Pentagon now recognizes incels as 99% of school shooters.
[02:28:52.091 --> 02:28:54.012]  We broke that years ago and profiled them.
[02:28:54.772 --> 02:29:00.896]  Devil-worshipping, white males who hate women are every mass shooter.
[02:29:11.793 --> 02:29:15.975]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:29:16.915 --> 02:29:30.680]  What do you do to a 100% American company standing up for unborn, standing up for babies being killed after they're born, standing up against sexualization of children and pedophile drag queen story time for kids?
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:31.681]  What do you do?
[02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:37.563]  Well, we just saw in thousands of publications, we just saw how they strike back on it.
[02:29:38.254 --> 02:29:40.795]  Well, and it's the same thing they always do with projection.
[02:29:41.096 --> 02:29:47.479]  It really makes you wonder about them projecting child porn and pedophilic activity onto you, which you're totally innocent of.
[02:29:47.559 --> 02:29:50.020]  It's totally proven in the documents, in the stories.
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:51.521]  They just run with a fake headline.
[02:29:51.921 --> 02:29:54.103]  But remember what happened in the 2016 election?
[02:29:54.683 --> 02:29:57.104]  Hillary Clinton colluded with Russia, and then what'd they say?
[02:29:57.404 --> 02:29:58.465]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[02:29:58.505 --> 02:30:05.589]  So it really makes you wonder if they're not doing that same psychology to you right now, who've been talking about the underground pedophile rings for decades.
[02:30:06.687 --> 02:30:09.848]  And again, we get hit with a fake Sandy Hook lawsuit.
[02:30:09.868 --> 02:30:10.488]  Stuff we didn't do.
[02:30:10.528 --> 02:30:11.528]  They're using the poor families.
[02:30:11.909 --> 02:30:14.049]  And they want all our emails.
[02:30:14.069 --> 02:30:15.109]  9.6 million that said Sandy Hook.
[02:30:15.610 --> 02:30:17.590]  We go, hey, how about just ones with Sandy Hook in them?
[02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:19.151]  And a bunch of other search terms.
[02:30:19.171 --> 02:30:20.251]  All the families, all the names.
[02:30:20.271 --> 02:30:21.531]  We don't even talk about them.
[02:30:21.551 --> 02:30:22.412]  They search it all.
[02:30:22.612 --> 02:30:23.672]  They go, we want your metadata.
[02:30:23.692 --> 02:30:24.332]  We're like, what's that?
[02:30:24.392 --> 02:30:25.332]  All the weird code.
[02:30:26.113 --> 02:30:30.754]  So they find hidden links in there and go report to the FBI.
[02:30:30.894 --> 02:30:32.094]  I got pissed about that.
[02:30:33.135 --> 02:30:34.155]  And so what's their response?
[02:30:35.367 --> 02:30:37.771]  Alex Jones sent Sandy Hook family's child porn.
[02:30:38.331 --> 02:30:39.233]  No, I didn't send them.
[02:30:39.313 --> 02:30:43.519]  People threatening us for covering Sandy Hook said we're going to get you because you cover Sandy Hook.
[02:30:43.859 --> 02:30:46.263]  Sent us links that we didn't open.
[02:30:47.244 --> 02:30:50.389]  That's like if somebody comes and puts child porn in your mailbox.
[02:30:50.749 --> 02:30:51.570]  It's not your fault.
[02:30:52.734 --> 02:30:54.775]  This is crazy, but they think just that term.
[02:30:54.815 --> 02:31:00.357]  They think you're so dumb that they're just gonna say the word, the term child porn.
[02:31:00.597 --> 02:31:01.817]  Well, only a little bit of runaway from you.
[02:31:02.118 --> 02:31:03.018]  Folks, nobody's buying it.
[02:31:03.038 --> 02:31:05.279]  We're seeing our support surge, but that's good.
[02:31:06.493 --> 02:31:08.895]  Because we gotta fight these people on every front, that's why.
[02:31:08.936 --> 02:31:15.702]  When you get a t-shirt, when you get a book, when you get a film, when you get great supplements, you are literally funding the second American Revolution against evil.
[02:31:16.403 --> 02:31:19.566]  It's never been clearer, the fight between good and evil, and everybody I think's getting it.
[02:31:19.907 --> 02:31:22.910]  Well, and I just want the audience to understand how dire it is.
[02:31:22.930 --> 02:31:25.573]  I mean, we were just talking, how many cards did they have left?
[02:31:25.993 --> 02:31:32.876]  To try and play against us before they literally try to put a bullet in your head or just blow this place up with, like, I mean, who knows what these Antifa people around here do.
[02:31:32.916 --> 02:31:34.137]  I hope they wouldn't get that violent.
[02:31:34.197 --> 02:31:38.959]  Or maybe, you know, some spook CIA, FBI wants to come through here and try to mess with us.
[02:31:38.999 --> 02:31:40.300]  I know that you've dealt with that before.
[02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:42.041]  And we're not bitching and complaining.
[02:31:42.061 --> 02:31:43.241]  We want a strong finish.
[02:31:44.062 --> 02:31:45.963]  I think we're going to continue on, but whatever.
[02:31:46.003 --> 02:31:47.864]  We're going on into the frickin' night.
[02:31:48.564 --> 02:31:50.085]  We're pedal to the metal.
[02:31:50.225 --> 02:31:57.451]  It's that old saying of John Paul Jones, when the ship was sinking, fighting the British, they said, surrender, and he said, I've only begun to fight.
[02:31:57.872 --> 02:31:59.113]  We don't know how to give up.
[02:31:59.673 --> 02:32:05.298]  And I feel good at a spiritual level, because the fact that the enemy has to play one of their ace of spades.
[02:32:06.158 --> 02:32:08.640]  I agree, kill us, whatever, that's the next one that makes the smartest.
[02:32:08.941 --> 02:32:09.701]  It's not going to work.
[02:32:09.821 --> 02:32:11.102]  They're losing, Owen.
[02:32:11.343 --> 02:32:14.926]  Well, imagine, for me, it's like, as a news reporter, as a show host,
[02:32:15.686 --> 02:32:18.368]  I wanted to play for the best team, and that was InfoWars.
[02:32:18.409 --> 02:32:23.573]  So that's like, let's say a young kid grows up trying to play baseball, and he wants to play for the New York Yankees.
[02:32:24.053 --> 02:32:27.156]  But he finds out, uh-oh, someone's trying to destroy the Yankees.
[02:32:27.216 --> 02:32:31.099]  The Mets are trying to destroy the Yankees, and they're lying about them, and the Yankees are in dire straits.
[02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:33.161]  But that kid just wants to play for the Yankees.
[02:32:33.201 --> 02:32:36.664]  He just got drafted, and he's just saying, fans, please support the Yankees.
[02:32:36.724 --> 02:32:40.307]  Make sure that the Yankees are still here so you can go to the stadium and root for them and I can play for them.
[02:32:40.668 --> 02:32:41.909]  That's where we're at right now.
[02:32:42.029 --> 02:32:43.410]  I want to play for InfoWars forever.
[02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.970]  Exactly.
[02:32:44.010 --> 02:32:46.491]  They're saying we're putting cyanide in the peanuts and hot dogs.
[02:32:47.672 --> 02:32:48.552]  None of it's true, folks.
[02:32:48.612 --> 02:32:49.753]  We're not the pedophiles.
[02:32:50.333 --> 02:32:52.714]  We're the Patriots, and we're winning thanks to your support.
[02:32:53.094 --> 02:32:57.596]  We have Save & For Special, 50% off, double Patriot points, storewide free shipping.
[02:32:57.916 --> 02:33:01.317]  Double down, take action, and show these bastards we're not backing down.
[02:33:01.337 --> 02:33:02.158]  God bless you all.
[02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:09.281]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.617 --> 02:33:21.400]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:22.181 --> 02:33:24.762]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:24.782 --> 02:33:29.265]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.359 --> 02:33:33.542]  Okay, Gerald Cilente's got a particularly powerful program lined up today.
[02:33:33.562 --> 02:33:34.743]  4 in the 4th hour in the War Room.
[02:33:34.783 --> 02:33:35.764]  Owen Schroer's coming up.
[02:33:35.784 --> 02:33:38.806]  Don't forget, Wednesday and Thursday night, I'll be here.
[02:33:38.826 --> 02:33:40.008]  Owen Schroer and many others.
[02:33:40.888 --> 02:33:41.949]  It's Clown World!
[02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:43.130]  Two nights only!
[02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:44.331]  The greatest show on Earth!
[02:33:44.732 --> 02:33:46.093]  The Democrat debates.
[02:33:46.193 --> 02:33:49.816]  So many of them, it takes two nights to look at all these cockroaches.
[02:33:51.157 --> 02:33:53.279]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.001]  Spread the word!
[02:34:00.171 --> 02:34:00.531]  All right.
[02:34:02.133 --> 02:34:10.723]  I want to hit this Ilhan Omar because I mentioned a few days ago and she's teaming up with AOC to bitch about America.
[02:34:10.743 --> 02:34:19.894]  And imagine she gets there 10 years ago, married her brother, reportedly has three children with him, gets elected to Congress by the guilt-ridden Minnesotans.
[02:34:22.885 --> 02:34:27.889]  And then says, oh, I will call people being stopped trying to get into the U.S.
[02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:32.994]  from their collapsed countries, concentration camps, or just figuring out who's adults and who are children.
[02:34:33.274 --> 02:34:39.559]  And then the media reruns the photos of Obama with kids in cages, which again, all it was was chain link fence.
[02:34:43.136 --> 02:34:46.478]  What do you do when 30% aren't even with their parents?
[02:34:46.538 --> 02:34:54.182]  There's kids unattended, thousands pouring across the day, and you're just like, oh, just hand them over to Democrats and child sex slavery, which the Senate report admits!
[02:34:55.759 --> 02:34:57.280]  But she sits there all with her fake love.
[02:34:57.901 --> 02:34:59.842]  Oh, I'm pulling up next to your ship.
[02:34:59.882 --> 02:35:00.783]  I'm climbing on.
[02:35:01.143 --> 02:35:08.970]  Women are sex slaves in Somalia and have no rights, but I'm gonna come here and tell you how good Islam is and how America sucks and shake my finger at you, wear my little get-up.
[02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:10.471]  Damn, she's so ugly.
[02:35:10.491 --> 02:35:11.912]  I'm glad she wears that hood over her head.
[02:35:12.553 --> 02:35:13.534]  Like an ugly donkey.
[02:35:14.515 --> 02:35:17.197]  She got this donkey literally pissing in our face all day.
[02:35:18.302 --> 02:35:19.083]  Give me a break.
[02:35:19.103 --> 02:35:20.243]  I mean, my God!
[02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:26.488]  You come here, you get elected to Congress in 10 years, you sucked off welfare the whole time, you pig!
[02:35:27.048 --> 02:35:28.529]  You America-hating pig!
[02:35:28.549 --> 02:35:31.891]  And then you get here and tell us how much we suck all day.
[02:35:31.931 --> 02:35:32.532]  Here she is.
[02:35:33.513 --> 02:35:34.613]  Could I get a moment of your time?
[02:35:34.733 --> 02:35:41.118]  Could you tell me, do you agree with AOC that ICE is running concentration camps on the border?
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:44.881]  Look at that airhead.
[02:35:44.901 --> 02:35:45.741]  Sorry, back it up again.
[02:35:45.781 --> 02:35:46.602]  Just look at her.
[02:35:47.728 --> 02:35:48.168]  Back her up.
[02:35:48.208 --> 02:35:50.029]  We're talking 75 IQ.
[02:35:50.109 --> 02:35:54.131]  Okay, inbred like the day is long.
[02:35:54.812 --> 02:35:58.654]  But she's got a will to dominate you and you will bow to her!
[02:35:59.434 --> 02:36:00.335]  She's the pirate!
[02:36:00.535 --> 02:36:01.315]  She's the king!
[02:36:01.616 --> 02:36:02.896]  She comes from the failed state!
[02:36:03.216 --> 02:36:04.177]  You're gonna bow!
[02:36:04.657 --> 02:36:06.418]  Like a rattlesnake biting you on the neck!
[02:36:06.858 --> 02:36:09.220]  Your carotid arteries belong to her fangs!
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:10.340]  Let's see her again.
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:15.023]  Here she comes, toddling up like a Day of the Dead zombie to suck our soul!
[02:36:16.127 --> 02:36:17.208]  Hi, could I get a moment of your time?
[02:36:17.228 --> 02:36:23.795]  Could you tell me, do you agree with AOC that ICE is running concentration camps on the border?
[02:36:26.041 --> 02:36:28.383]  There are camps and people are being concentrated.
[02:36:28.403 --> 02:36:29.624]  This is very simple.
[02:36:29.704 --> 02:36:33.327]  I don't even know why this is a controversial thing for her to say.
[02:36:33.467 --> 02:36:47.399]  We have to really truthfully speak about what's taking place and this is why it's really important for us to abolish ICE and make sure that we have an agency that is accountable to the people, that is dealing with the situation in a humane way.
[02:36:47.719 --> 02:36:48.360]  There's no
[02:36:50.185 --> 02:36:57.008]  There's no way that we can allow for kids to be caged in this country.
[02:36:57.028 --> 02:36:57.628]  Kids to be caged?
[02:36:57.688 --> 02:37:03.470]  To be separated from their families and people being terrorized in their communities.
[02:37:04.210 --> 02:37:08.652]  Is it fair to... We have to make sure that we are calling it out and I am 100% with Alex.
[02:37:09.573 --> 02:37:10.093]  What a demon.
[02:37:10.113 --> 02:37:11.793]  What an arrogant, inbred demon.
[02:37:12.174 --> 02:37:13.294]  But inbreeding causes that.
[02:37:13.734 --> 02:37:15.115]  Now, she's sitting there.
[02:37:15.135 --> 02:37:16.755]  She has no freedom in her country.
[02:37:16.775 --> 02:37:17.316]  She's a slave.
[02:37:19.039 --> 02:37:21.021]  You're kidnapped in five minutes, women have no rights.
[02:37:21.801 --> 02:37:28.146]  But she's here telling us that collapsing borders, like when you fly on an airplane, they check your ID.
[02:37:28.847 --> 02:37:30.828]  She's saying just let everybody in, don't even check them.
[02:37:30.848 --> 02:37:36.173]  But again, the Senate report, Washington Post admits a third of the kids aren't even with their parents, many sex slaves.
[02:37:36.473 --> 02:37:37.834]  But she just says let them all in.
[02:37:38.715 --> 02:37:40.156]  What a monstrous pig.
[02:37:41.157 --> 02:37:42.338]  What a monstrous creature.
[02:37:43.539 --> 02:37:46.241]  There's Biden, he says it's time for that physical revolution.
[02:37:47.694 --> 02:37:50.636]  Or let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking about it.
[02:37:50.997 --> 02:37:54.900]  Because we have to be able to change what we're doing within our system.
[02:37:55.761 --> 02:38:04.008]  And then you've got the City Councilwoman a few weeks ago that just got elected in Denver, another AOC prototype, saying, by any means necessary, which means violence.
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:05.540]  Here it is.
[02:38:06.721 --> 02:38:09.602]  I don't believe that our current economic system actually works.
[02:38:10.062 --> 02:38:10.922]  Hit pause again.
[02:38:11.583 --> 02:38:12.263]  Oh, I get it.
[02:38:12.283 --> 02:38:13.764]  A crony capital system is bad enough.
[02:38:13.804 --> 02:38:17.645]  You want communism where a bunch of elites run everything and everybody starves to death.
[02:38:18.385 --> 02:38:19.586]  Like Venezuela or Cuba.
[02:38:20.166 --> 02:38:21.767]  I think our system sucks.
[02:38:21.807 --> 02:38:22.927]  We need to do good.
[02:38:23.087 --> 02:38:24.148]  Here, let's go back to her.
[02:38:25.088 --> 02:38:28.490]  I don't believe that our current economic system actually works.
[02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:33.492]  Capitalism by design is extractive and in order to generate... Hit pause.
[02:38:33.512 --> 02:38:33.992]  Start over again.
[02:38:36.124 --> 02:38:38.025]  Capitalism is extractive.
[02:38:39.905 --> 02:38:42.466]  Any political or economic system is extractive.
[02:38:47.028 --> 02:38:47.548]  Think about that.
[02:38:50.169 --> 02:38:52.510]  Like, communist countries have the worst environmental standards of anybody.
[02:38:52.530 --> 02:38:58.512]  But notice the communist protesters, the green protesters, they don't want coal plants shut down in China.
[02:38:58.532 --> 02:39:00.352]  They want them shut down in Germany or here.
[02:39:00.893 --> 02:39:01.833]  Because it's cheap fuel.
[02:39:03.370 --> 02:39:12.193]  But Bernie Sanders says white people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[02:39:12.974 --> 02:39:21.837]  He's never had a job in his life except swindling universities and multi-million dollar homes and $100,000 sports cars.
[02:39:23.157 --> 02:39:29.900]  So let's go back to the lady, the new city council lady in Denver.
[02:39:31.033 --> 02:39:34.434]  I don't believe that our current economic system actually works.
[02:39:34.854 --> 02:39:37.295]  Capitalism, by design, is extractive.
[02:39:37.815 --> 02:39:42.816]  And in order to generate profit in a capitalist system, something has to be exploited.
[02:39:43.136 --> 02:39:44.896]  That's land, labor, or resources.
[02:39:45.237 --> 02:39:45.877]  Pause again.
[02:39:46.497 --> 02:39:48.537]  Just listen to her spewing what our universities teach us.
[02:39:48.557 --> 02:39:49.738]  The big banks want failure.
[02:39:50.078 --> 02:39:51.818]  The big megacorporations want you to be an idiot.
[02:39:51.838 --> 02:39:55.179]  So she's just like, oh, the exploiter is bad.
[02:39:55.199 --> 02:39:58.780]  I mean, just listen to this, as if communism and things don't...
[02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:01.001]  Someone's being exploited.
[02:40:03.403 --> 02:40:06.605]  And she just rattles this crap off like, oh, yes, ma'am.
[02:40:07.326 --> 02:40:07.826]  Teach us.
[02:40:08.367 --> 02:40:09.368]  Teach us how it works.
[02:40:09.388 --> 02:40:12.190]  Because in communist systems, they don't elect people, dumbass.
[02:40:12.370 --> 02:40:13.371]  They have politburos.
[02:40:13.571 --> 02:40:16.393]  The ruling party puts their lackeys in forever!
[02:40:18.054 --> 02:40:18.895]  That's exploitive!
[02:40:21.035 --> 02:40:28.818]  Che Guevara called Hispanics in Mexico cockroaches because they wouldn't be communist and communalize and leave their pieces of property.
[02:40:28.838 --> 02:40:30.679]  He goes, oh, these poor horrible things.
[02:40:30.719 --> 02:40:31.599]  Read his quotes about Mexicans.
[02:40:31.959 --> 02:40:34.160]  Oh, these stupid Mexicans, these little dumb cockroaches.
[02:40:34.541 --> 02:40:35.841]  They won't give up their land.
[02:40:36.121 --> 02:40:39.403]  You know, they like 50 acres and communalize and let us take over.
[02:40:39.423 --> 02:40:42.984]  Yeah, they wouldn't let you sit over them and execute them and do whatever they wanted.
[02:40:43.884 --> 02:40:46.866]  And you got pissed off because you're Che Guevara.
[02:40:47.426 --> 02:40:48.706]  Oh, my God, Che Guevara.
[02:40:48.906 --> 02:40:50.067]  You're so cool looking.
[02:40:51.630 --> 02:40:54.352]  So let's hear from this dumb-as-a-box-of-bricks lady.
[02:40:54.372 --> 02:40:54.872]  Here she is.
[02:40:55.552 --> 02:41:00.895]  We're in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move into something new.
[02:41:00.915 --> 02:41:06.458]  I believe in community ownership of land, labor, resources and distribution of those resources.
[02:41:06.999 --> 02:41:16.384]  And so whatever that morphs into I think is what will serve community the best and I'm excited to usher it in by any means necessary.
[02:41:17.714 --> 02:41:37.865]  That little... she's thinking about me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
[02:41:47.423 --> 02:41:48.244]  Very, very sad.
[02:41:48.284 --> 02:41:49.226]  This is who the left's running.
[02:41:51.229 --> 02:41:56.737]  Plenty of young, smart Hispanic women who are conservative or Christian or at least nationalist, but oh no!
[02:41:57.738 --> 02:41:58.159]  No, no, no.
[02:41:58.179 --> 02:42:00.842]  We've got to find people brainwashed to all make it racial.
[02:42:02.011 --> 02:42:02.211]  I think?
[02:42:24.482 --> 02:42:25.563]  These reports I haven't hit yet.
[02:42:25.583 --> 02:42:26.544]  There are so many big ones.
[02:42:27.426 --> 02:42:32.011]  We'll air the global 5G rollout exodus of the elites away from 5G has begun.
[02:42:32.532 --> 02:42:34.134]  Big boil down that's so important from yesterday.
[02:42:35.828 --> 02:42:39.310]  We'll play just a clip where she says that liberals says unborn babies are tapeworms.
[02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:42.191]  Millie Weaver, full video up on InfoWars.com.
[02:42:43.031 --> 02:42:46.873]  And then we've got some other reports here that we're going to be airing.
[02:42:46.913 --> 02:42:48.374]  And then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:42:48.694 --> 02:42:56.277]  Please don't forget, store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, and 50% off all the supplements without you funding us.
[02:42:56.377 --> 02:42:57.018]  We won't be here.
[02:42:57.378 --> 02:42:58.518]  Please take action today.
[02:42:59.018 --> 02:42:59.539]  Stay with us.
[02:42:59.599 --> 02:43:00.019]  We'll be back.
[02:43:02.946 --> 02:43:08.890]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on earth, Clown World.
[02:43:10.371 --> 02:43:18.255]  20 socialist, globalist, communist candidates, all in one spot for two nights only.
[02:43:18.676 --> 02:43:24.239]  And you're gonna have uncensored, unbridled, pure analysis like no one else can do it.
[02:43:24.579 --> 02:43:30.823]  Clown World, the greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[02:43:31.443 --> 02:43:33.185]  June 26th and 27th.
[02:43:33.225 --> 02:43:35.507]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[02:43:35.988 --> 02:43:39.051]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:43:39.591 --> 02:43:41.153]  It's the greatest show on earth.
[02:43:41.633 --> 02:43:47.078]  A bunch of parasites, bitching and complaining, working for the Chi-Coms to overthrow America.
[02:43:47.559 --> 02:43:54.385]  Join us next Wednesday and Thursday for Clown World, the biggest show on earth!
[02:43:55.106 --> 02:43:56.187]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[02:43:56.367 --> 02:43:57.087]  I'm P.T.
[02:43:57.107 --> 02:43:57.427]  Barnum.
[02:43:57.807 --> 02:43:58.708]  I love the Democrats.
[02:43:59.128 --> 02:44:04.390]  Beto O'Rourke says the world's ending in 11 years, and the borders should be open.
[02:44:04.650 --> 02:44:05.951]  There's so many other clowns.
[02:44:06.251 --> 02:44:11.994]  Cory Booker says pay reparations, even if 98% of whites didn't have answers as their own slaves.
[02:44:12.434 --> 02:44:14.635]  And then we move on to Pocahontas.
[02:44:14.895 --> 02:44:18.416]  She's whiter than anybody ever known in history, but it's okay.
[02:44:18.437 --> 02:44:19.177]  She's a fraud.
[02:44:19.477 --> 02:44:20.457]  And then Joe Biden.
[02:44:20.778 --> 02:44:23.539]  Well, Joe Biden loves segregationists, and
[02:44:24.159 --> 02:44:27.060]  Wants to put blacks in prison for three times the sentence of whites.
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:30.121]  But hey, the Democratic Party loves the KKK!
[02:44:30.481 --> 02:44:32.102]  And then Swallowswell!
[02:44:32.482 --> 02:44:37.123]  He says, use nuclear weapons on gun owners that don't turn their weapons in!
[02:44:37.503 --> 02:44:40.724]  Bernie Sanders says, it's white people?
[02:44:40.744 --> 02:44:42.765]  I don't know what it's like to be poor!
[02:44:43.185 --> 02:44:44.565]  And you've got Buttigieg!
[02:44:45.006 --> 02:44:45.846]  Oh, what a king!
[02:44:46.246 --> 02:44:47.666]  And of course Camilla Ellis!
[02:44:48.046 --> 02:44:49.407]  And so many others!
[02:44:49.907 --> 02:44:51.209]  It's the greatest show on earth.
[02:44:51.589 --> 02:45:01.924]  Join us this next Wednesday and this next Thursday for coverage of the Democratic Tonight's Debates, the greatest clown show on earth at InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[02:45:35.799 --> 02:45:36.400]  But guess what?

[02:46:18.265 --> 02:46:29.230]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:46:29.911 --> 02:46:34.093]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.

[02:47:06.064 --> 02:47:10.606]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.208 --> 02:47:19.290]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.551 --> 02:47:28.494]  The elite are all moving to New Zealand in underground bunkers for the collapse of civilization.
[02:47:28.534 --> 02:47:30.015]  Well, I explained that that is a diversion.
[02:47:31.243 --> 02:47:32.864]  I told you for at least five years that my contacts
[02:47:55.103 --> 02:47:58.967]  The super-rich of Silicon Valley have a doomsday escape plan.
[02:47:58.987 --> 02:47:59.227]  Bloomberg.
[02:47:59.247 --> 02:48:02.510]  Why Silicon Valley billionaires are prepping for the apocalypse in New Zealand.
[02:48:02.530 --> 02:48:03.811]  Terminator director James Cameron.
[02:48:04.311 --> 02:48:05.352]  The machines have already won.
[02:48:18.519 --> 02:48:24.925]  And you've got, again, Elon Musk saying the end of the world's coming, they're going to depopulate us, the elites have decided to get rid of us, U.S.
[02:48:25.005 --> 02:48:28.088]  elites buying up New Zealand, we're about to escape the crack-up of civilization.
[02:48:29.529 --> 02:48:31.251]  Now what is the crack-up of civilization?
[02:48:32.111 --> 02:48:33.393]  What do they know that we don't know?
[02:48:33.473 --> 02:48:34.534]  Well, we actually do know.
[02:48:35.444 --> 02:48:42.709]  Normal cell phone radiation from the towers and the phones causes massive brain tumors, massive breakage of DNA.
[02:48:43.509 --> 02:48:45.651]  We've been spending years covering all that.
[02:48:45.771 --> 02:48:46.251]  It's a fact.
[02:48:46.611 --> 02:48:47.392]  Here's Wired Magazine.
[02:48:48.052 --> 02:48:49.573]  5G smartphones cause cancer.
[02:48:49.633 --> 02:48:51.174]  Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[02:48:51.775 --> 02:48:52.996]  Mind control by cell phone.
[02:48:53.036 --> 02:49:00.140]  Scientific, American, and then they can put over different wavelengths to actually control your brain with the carrier web that's on it, developed by the DARPA and the CIA.
[02:49:01.201 --> 02:49:04.422]  Doctor says children particularly vulnerable to the dangers of 5G.
[02:49:05.302 --> 02:49:06.082]  5G danger.
[02:49:06.482 --> 02:49:12.224]  Hundreds of respected scientists sound the alarm about health effects of 5G networks go up nationwide.
[02:49:12.964 --> 02:49:19.086]  Cancer cluster at California Elementary School results in removal of Sprint Shell Tower.
[02:49:19.546 --> 02:49:20.506]  Even the teachers are dying.
[02:49:20.666 --> 02:49:21.767]  I'm giving you a gestalt.
[02:49:21.807 --> 02:49:24.507]  I'm giving you one one millionth of the knowledge.
[02:49:24.547 --> 02:49:24.927]  Seriously.
[02:49:25.428 --> 02:49:26.848]  But imagine, it's a lot of knowledge, isn't it?
[02:49:28.703 --> 02:49:31.604]  So how would they release a bioweapon and be safe from it?
[02:49:32.865 --> 02:49:40.387]  How would they have 5G that gives you cancer or resonates with certain viruses to actually make them replicate and turn off your immune system?
[02:49:40.407 --> 02:49:41.328]  That's in major studies.
[02:49:41.728 --> 02:49:44.169]  I've heard from Nick Begichon and others about the hundreds of patents.
[02:49:44.589 --> 02:49:49.971]  From an article that was originally in a Russian journal called Orienteer, a military journal.
[02:49:50.491 --> 02:49:53.512]  And what it talked about, and was later absolutely
[02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:13.198]  Was the idea that any electromagnetic carrier, any system that can carry a signal can carry a sub signal, a signal on it that allows you to manipulate the behavior of people within contact of that signal.
[02:50:13.238 --> 02:50:18.464]  Now, what can be used is the Internet, telephone, radio network.
[02:50:20.945 --> 02:50:30.130]  They're doing an emergency operation to save the Earth from humans.
[02:50:30.830 --> 02:50:37.393]  And so they've got to all get rich and powerful and dumb us down and turn us against each other and destroy new technologies and clean technologies.
[02:50:37.454 --> 02:50:37.594]  No.
[02:50:37.854 --> 02:50:40.775]  No, the truth is they're just sabotaging things and taking over.
[02:50:41.075 --> 02:50:43.797]  I later learned that the Silicon Valley crowd
[02:50:44.577 --> 02:50:54.741]  ...is running to Kauai, Hawaii, where the most secretive Pentagon, NSA, super weapons, space-based weapons are directed from.
[02:50:54.981 --> 02:50:56.742]  Again, they're building fortresses there.
[02:50:56.922 --> 02:50:57.902]  And that's come out in the news.
[02:50:58.743 --> 02:51:00.063]  And I mean underground bases.
[02:51:00.143 --> 02:51:04.585]  I mean rocks that pop up that have, you know, huge double .50 caliber guns in them.
[02:51:05.025 --> 02:51:07.306]  I'm talking about drone attack helicopters.
[02:51:07.746 --> 02:51:10.247]  I've talked to folks in Kauai that have worked on them.
[02:51:10.908 --> 02:51:13.969]  I got told by a high-level government individual
[02:51:15.336 --> 02:51:22.483]  And then I got told by a major Hollywood producer, within a month of each other, I ought to move to West Virginia.
[02:51:23.704 --> 02:51:29.149]  14,000 square miles, no technology allowed, but NASA bases.
[02:51:29.649 --> 02:51:31.932]  And it turns out they've got a couple of these in Canada.
[02:51:33.323 --> 02:51:38.527]  In Northern Canada, right before the Arctic Circle, they're building air bases, helicopter bases, all of it.
[02:51:38.908 --> 02:51:46.414]  And you read, and you study, that all these ultra-rich people are moving into the area, and they have been for decades.
[02:51:46.694 --> 02:51:57.002]  There's all these breakaway scientific projects that are overlapping, that are buildings towards some larger endgame, and they're going from beta tests now to operational.
[02:51:57.423 --> 02:51:59.865]  And all of it kills people!
[02:52:01.136 --> 02:52:28.084]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[02:52:28.384 --> 02:52:29.705]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[02:52:30.703 --> 02:52:31.623]  Does that have a heartbeat?
[02:52:31.643 --> 02:52:33.784]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[02:52:34.204 --> 02:52:35.844]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[02:52:37.964 --> 02:52:39.765]  InfoWars.
[02:52:39.865 --> 02:52:44.586]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:52:45.406 --> 02:52:46.586]  What are you guys out here for?
[02:52:47.246 --> 02:52:51.247]  I'm out here to get rights for everybody who needs them.
[02:52:52.267 --> 02:52:54.227]  So who do you think needs the rights the most?
[02:52:54.788 --> 02:52:56.128]  Anybody with a uterus.
[02:52:57.615 --> 02:52:58.596]  Anyone with a uterus?
[02:52:58.616 --> 02:53:02.179]  Okay, so what about the unborn babies in the womb?
[02:53:02.239 --> 02:53:03.821]  They have uteruses, believe it or not.
[02:53:05.382 --> 02:53:10.647]  Like, female babies in the womb have uteruses.
[02:53:10.667 --> 02:53:13.450]  So you said anyone that has a uterus should have rights?
[02:53:13.770 --> 02:53:17.694]  Yes, but they are not breathing, living human beings yet, so...
[02:53:19.315 --> 02:53:20.495]  Well, they're hearts beating.
[02:53:20.615 --> 02:53:21.956]  Doesn't that count for living?
[02:53:23.517 --> 02:53:24.437]  Cells vibrating.
[02:53:24.457 --> 02:53:25.277]  It's not a heartbeat?
[02:53:25.597 --> 02:53:26.758]  It's cells vibrating.
[02:53:27.618 --> 02:53:29.899]  At what point is it not just cells vibrating?
[02:53:30.119 --> 02:53:30.479]  I don't know.
[02:53:30.519 --> 02:53:33.040]  I'm not a medical doctor, but it's not at six weeks.
[02:53:34.441 --> 02:53:38.842]  Okay, so do you think that babies should be allowed to be aborted up until whenever?
[02:53:38.862 --> 02:53:44.024]  I believe they're fetuses and it's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[02:53:44.044 --> 02:53:45.645]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[02:53:46.505 --> 02:53:47.565]  Is that how the heart beats?
[02:53:47.605 --> 02:53:49.726]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[02:53:50.166 --> 02:53:51.746]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[02:53:52.627 --> 02:53:58.028]  Wow, don't you think that's kind of cold and callous to think that when callous is to shove your fingers inside somebody?
[02:53:58.048 --> 02:54:05.810]  I don't think she's with any organization, so let's stop talking to them.
[02:54:06.170 --> 02:54:07.090]  Animals get killed?
[02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:09.211]  Yeah, they're living and breathing.
[02:54:09.731 --> 02:54:13.094]  Okay, so what about the rights of human beings, though?
[02:54:13.555 --> 02:54:16.898]  Should human rights matter?
[02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:20.861]  They're so small, they can't even think.
[02:54:20.881 --> 02:54:24.505]  Do you remember back to when you were that young?
[02:54:24.965 --> 02:54:30.931]  Well, some women are saying we should have abortion, like she just said, at any time in the pregnancy, even up until the day before.
[02:54:31.437 --> 02:54:33.159]  I don't agree with that.
[02:54:33.479 --> 02:54:37.302]  Whatever's best for that woman should be that woman's choice.
[02:54:37.362 --> 02:54:39.944]  It should not be no government's choice.
[02:54:40.405 --> 02:54:42.006]  It should be up to that woman.
[02:54:42.026 --> 02:54:46.430]  So that baby can survive on its own outside the womb in the third trimester?
[02:54:46.450 --> 02:54:47.551]  We're having a hard time hearing.
[02:54:47.591 --> 02:54:49.853]  Yet it's okay to kill it?
[02:54:50.093 --> 02:54:52.595]  She's gonna have to, you know, give birth to it anyway.
[02:54:53.075 --> 02:54:55.958]  Why give birth to a dead baby when you can let it live?
[02:54:56.198 --> 02:54:57.079]  Can you go over that way?
[02:54:57.159 --> 02:54:58.200]  Oh, don't touch me, ma'am.
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:54:59.120]  Don't touch me.
[02:55:00.141 --> 02:55:01.562]  This is a public area.
[02:55:01.582 --> 02:55:02.442]  I'm allowed to be here.
[02:55:02.462 --> 02:55:05.724]  Okay, alright.
[02:55:07.945 --> 02:55:09.025]  I'm being pushed right now.
[02:55:09.486 --> 02:55:10.746]  You don't have a right to touch me.
[02:55:10.846 --> 02:55:11.867]  It's my body.
[02:55:12.327 --> 02:55:12.967]  My choice.
[02:55:12.987 --> 02:55:14.328]  This is my body.
[02:55:14.708 --> 02:55:17.289]  The baby in the womb is not your body.
[02:55:17.449 --> 02:55:23.112]  Except we're concerned about the baby's body that isn't your DNA.
[02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:24.092]  It's not your body.
[02:55:24.112 --> 02:55:25.873]  It's not their body.
[02:55:28.220 --> 02:55:28.881]  No, it's not.
[02:55:29.301 --> 02:55:30.402]  It's not their body.
[02:55:30.422 --> 02:55:31.763]  It's their baby.
[02:55:31.823 --> 02:55:33.284]  That is your body.
[02:55:33.304 --> 02:55:33.945]  This is my body.
[02:55:34.025 --> 02:55:36.126]  I'm talking about the baby in the belly.
[02:55:36.527 --> 02:55:37.367]  It's not their body.
[02:55:37.427 --> 02:55:40.270]  That is not their... It's not their DNA.
[02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:41.030]  It's a fetus.
[02:55:41.050 --> 02:55:41.891]  Okay, so I have a question.
[02:55:41.911 --> 02:55:43.872]  Don't pay no attention to her.
[02:55:44.053 --> 02:55:51.078]  So why do women that have Rh negative blood have to get shots so that they don't reject the baby because they have different blood types?
[02:55:51.358 --> 02:55:52.119]  Because that's their choice.
[02:55:52.139 --> 02:55:54.541]  Because it's a different DNA, it's a different body.
[02:55:54.561 --> 02:55:55.662]  It's still their choice.
[02:55:55.702 --> 02:55:56.702]  It's still their body.
[02:55:57.723 --> 02:55:58.684]  What's going on?
[02:55:58.844 --> 02:56:03.166]  We're talking out here and people are, you know... You're actually kind of interrupting this.
[02:56:03.186 --> 02:56:04.226]  Okay?
[02:56:04.606 --> 02:56:05.787]  So go away!
[02:56:06.207 --> 02:56:10.349]  Well, you guys are talking about interrupting the lives of unborn babies.
[02:56:10.449 --> 02:56:11.149]  No, ma'am.
[02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:14.691]  I was raped and I am not going to be forced to have my rapist child.
[02:56:14.731 --> 02:56:15.871]  I would have killed myself.
[02:56:16.571 --> 02:56:18.332]  Many women would have killed themselves.
[02:56:18.592 --> 02:56:19.593]  You want death!
[02:56:19.793 --> 02:56:21.273]  Rape is the small majority.
[02:56:21.313 --> 02:56:21.974]  No, it doesn't matter.
[02:56:22.054 --> 02:56:22.654]  And you know what?
[02:56:22.674 --> 02:56:24.575]  There's a larger majority than you think.
[02:56:25.155 --> 02:56:26.035]  It's larger than you think.
[02:56:26.055 --> 02:56:26.636]  You need to go!
[02:56:26.656 --> 02:56:28.716]  You need to go!
[02:56:29.277 --> 02:56:30.097]  You need to go!
[02:56:30.117 --> 02:56:33.838]  No one's judging people that were raped.
[02:56:33.958 --> 02:56:37.259]  We're having dialogue about what limitations there should be.
[02:56:42.742 --> 02:56:44.262]  People are getting really upset right now.
[02:56:44.302 --> 02:56:47.564]  I'm just trying to ask people questions on what the limitations are.
[02:56:48.284 --> 02:56:55.067]  You know, if you're going to hold a belief, people should be allowed to ask you questions about the ideas you're holding.
[02:56:58.326 --> 02:57:01.807]  Yeah, people are just kind of coming up, pushing me, putting their hands on me.
[02:57:01.887 --> 02:57:10.771]  I'm just trying to do interviews and ask questions and people are not happy with, I guess... You're trying to get in the way of us having... I'm not interrupting them.
[02:57:10.911 --> 02:57:12.152]  I'm literally not.
[02:57:12.532 --> 02:57:14.052]  We don't mind if you're here, it's fine.
[02:57:14.553 --> 02:57:23.755]  But, like, we couldn't hear the speakers, and so if you could go to that side of the crowd, we don't mind that you're here, we just don't want you to interrupt the program.
[02:57:23.815 --> 02:57:24.676]  Is that okay?
[02:57:24.836 --> 02:57:41.861]  Yeah, I'm listening to the program, and I'm participating in the program out here with you guys, so I'm just asking people questions as to why you believe what you believe, because if you guys want to have your message out there to people, you're going to have to make convincing arguments to convince people to support the beliefs that you want.
[02:57:43.024 --> 02:57:49.267]  I'm not trying to get into it with you, I'm just asking if you could move to that side of the podium.
[02:57:49.388 --> 02:57:54.570]  Dr. Marcus is CNN.
[02:58:00.133 --> 02:58:02.575]  So here's what though, but there's good news!
[02:58:04.116 --> 02:58:10.059]  I don't just come on air, willy nilly, without something to offer ya!
[02:58:11.531 --> 02:58:16.295]  Not only is Lefto the Clown here live for this segment, but I got good news!
[02:58:17.276 --> 02:58:23.541]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, Lefto the Clown has friends out there in the political community.
[02:58:23.941 --> 02:58:25.682]  A lot of them are in the government.
[02:58:25.983 --> 02:58:31.507]  And some of them want to be President of the United States!
[02:58:33.008 --> 02:58:33.729]  That's right!
[02:58:34.550 --> 02:58:39.514]  Some of Lefto's buddies are running for President of the United States!
[02:58:40.447 --> 02:58:44.831]  Now I know you're out there probably jumping for joy, but hold your horses!
[02:58:45.832 --> 02:58:49.255]  Because there's even more to be excited about!
[02:58:49.275 --> 02:58:59.685]  Not just that Lefto's friends are running for president, but that next week, they will be hosting a clown show!
[02:59:00.816 --> 02:59:01.936]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:02.417 --> 02:59:07.298]  Next week, the Democrats are having their first presidential debates.
[02:59:08.419 --> 02:59:09.699]  And you know what that means.
[02:59:10.319 --> 02:59:14.261]  It's the Clown World Show, the greatest comedy show on earth.
[02:59:14.721 --> 02:59:16.261]  The first Democrat debate.
[02:59:16.942 --> 02:59:20.523]  But ladies and gentlemen, we're so committed to your entertainment.
[02:59:21.263 --> 02:59:24.424]  We're so committed to you getting the full picture.
[02:59:25.045 --> 02:59:27.245]  We're so committed to the Clown World.
[02:59:28.006 --> 02:59:29.126]  We're gonna shake it up a bit.
[02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:45.490]  Not only do we have one night of presidential Democrat debates, we give you two nights of The Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth, and the best news is yet to come!
[02:59:46.711 --> 02:59:51.855]  It's all gonna be streamed live at infowars.com slash show!
[02:59:54.491 --> 02:59:58.594]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.115 --> 03:00:00.436]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.450 --> 03:00:19.931]  Hi, this is Gerald Cilenti.
[03:00:20.272 --> 03:00:23.054]  It's great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.766 --> 03:00:24.727]  Thanks for having me.
[03:00:24.807 --> 03:00:30.230]  And all you folks, remember, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:00:30.971 --> 03:00:32.752]  Keep buying those products.
[03:00:32.812 --> 03:00:35.834]  They're great and need your support.
[03:00:36.815 --> 03:00:37.856]  So what's going on?
[03:00:38.896 --> 03:00:40.978]  Well, you know, I've been on saying this for years.
[03:00:42.159 --> 03:00:44.540]  I've been buying gold since 1978.
[03:00:45.201 --> 03:00:46.161]  I was a youth.
[03:00:47.322 --> 03:00:48.523]  Not quite, but pretty young.
[03:00:49.504 --> 03:00:51.225]  And here's the deal.
[03:00:52.262 --> 03:00:55.823]  As we're speaking now, gold is over $1,400 an ounce.
[03:00:57.624 --> 03:01:06.187]  On June 6th, this year, a couple of weeks ago, what happened?
[03:01:07.408 --> 03:01:10.329]  Well, we sent out a trend alert.
[03:01:11.929 --> 03:01:14.130]  The gold bull run.
[03:01:15.250 --> 03:01:17.551]  And gold is running.
[03:01:19.232 --> 03:01:19.752]  It's gone up.
[03:01:21.345 --> 03:01:28.887]  Over 25% since we sent out that trend alert, that trend alert.
[03:01:31.328 --> 03:01:31.868]  It's big.
[03:01:33.268 --> 03:01:34.249]  Here's what's going on.
[03:01:35.989 --> 03:01:49.493]  All around the world, what they're doing is giving us more monetary methadone to shoot into the systems of
[03:01:51.212 --> 03:01:52.052]  Essential Banks.
[03:01:53.753 --> 03:01:55.754]  There's a global slowdown.
[03:02:01.437 --> 03:02:03.158]  The global slowdown is real.
[03:02:04.699 --> 03:02:06.860]  You look at the numbers coming out of Germany.
[03:02:08.261 --> 03:02:10.322]  You're looking at an economy growing.
[03:02:12.143 --> 03:02:13.804]  Yeah, about 0.6%.
[03:02:14.584 --> 03:02:14.684]  Oh!
[03:02:15.245 --> 03:02:17.866]  It just came out with some business confidence levels.
[03:02:18.987 --> 03:02:19.567]  Way down.
[03:02:21.437 --> 03:02:24.159]  Look what's going on over there in India.
[03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:27.521]  They just came out with a study.
[03:02:27.541 --> 03:02:33.086]  They're fabricating how much the government is growing over there, the GDP.
[03:02:34.086 --> 03:02:35.787]  It's way below what they say it is.
[03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.869]  What else?
[03:02:37.889 --> 03:02:40.131]  Oh, how about Australia?
[03:02:40.771 --> 03:02:42.692]  Oh yeah, they lowered interest rates too.
[03:02:43.833 --> 03:02:46.075]  They keep propping up the economy.
[03:02:47.202 --> 03:02:48.923]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:02:49.283 --> 03:02:54.126]  It has nothing to do with trade wars and tariffs.
[03:02:54.607 --> 03:02:55.847]  That's a lot of baloney.
[03:02:56.568 --> 03:02:59.330]  The trade wars and tariffs have equaled almost nothing.
[03:03:01.751 --> 03:03:03.792]  So, what's slowing it down?
[03:03:05.073 --> 03:03:06.334]  Economic fundamentals.
[03:03:07.615 --> 03:03:11.817]  It was cheap money that boosted it following the Great Recession.
[03:03:14.639 --> 03:03:16.160]  In 2009, when they started pumping that dough in.
[03:03:17.927 --> 03:03:19.228]  And it just means more cheap money.
[03:03:20.609 --> 03:03:22.910]  So, that's what's driving gold prices up.
[03:03:24.131 --> 03:03:29.514]  Because the lower the value of the currencies go, the higher the value of gold.
[03:03:30.394 --> 03:03:32.135]  And you read the reports coming out.
[03:03:32.936 --> 03:03:38.299]  You know last year the central banks bought more gold than they did in 50 years.
[03:03:39.079 --> 03:03:39.600]  That's right.
[03:03:40.380 --> 03:03:43.682]  And now China, the world's number two economy,
[03:03:44.465 --> 03:03:46.066]  They're buying up more gold, too.
[03:03:46.166 --> 03:03:49.549]  And, of course, Russia and Kazakhstan and this stand and that stand.
[03:03:50.209 --> 03:03:51.470]  And stand around the block.
[03:03:52.431 --> 03:03:53.371]  He's buying it, too.
[03:03:54.792 --> 03:03:57.154]  Because people are looking for a safe haven asset.
[03:03:58.815 --> 03:04:00.817]  And then there's what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:04:02.718 --> 03:04:03.739]  And that's real, too.
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:13.426]  If oil prices, I've been saying this, go to $100 a barrel, kiss the global economy goodbye,
[03:04:14.566 --> 03:04:18.469]  And, also, kiss those equity markets goodbye.
[03:04:20.211 --> 03:04:20.872]  So, gold.
[03:04:22.213 --> 03:04:26.656]  I said, and been saying this for nearly six years, and I'm on record.
[03:04:29.038 --> 03:04:34.403]  Gold had a break over $1,385 an ounce to gain strength.
[03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:37.205]  And it's broken past that now.
[03:04:39.747 --> 03:04:41.869]  The next breakout point is $1,000.
[03:04:43.900 --> 03:04:48.404]  $450.
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:48.404]  And it's not far from that.
[03:04:50.827 --> 03:04:52.448]  There's a lot more to know about this.
[03:04:52.468 --> 03:04:56.132]  And when I come back, we're gonna talk more about it.
[03:04:56.972 --> 03:05:00.476]  Meanwhile, don't forget to buy those products from Info.
[03:05:09.172 --> 03:05:12.034]  Announcing the greatest show on earth!

[03:05:39.899 --> 03:05:41.000]  Swallow's Whale Sizzle!
[03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:42.081]  New Gun Owners!
[03:05:42.221 --> 03:05:42.681]  Yay!
[03:05:43.081 --> 03:05:44.743]  Bernie Sanders!
[03:05:44.843 --> 03:05:46.484]  Love the Soviet Union!
[03:05:46.965 --> 03:05:47.906]  Camilla Harris!
[03:05:48.086 --> 03:05:49.347]  And so many more!
[03:05:49.807 --> 03:05:51.149]  It's the greatest show on Earth!
[03:05:51.529 --> 03:05:55.272]  Head to polewars.com forward slash show with live coverage next week!
[03:05:56.133 --> 03:06:03.259]  Next day and Thursday night.
[03:06:15.169 --> 03:06:18.091]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:18.572 --> 03:06:22.415]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:06:23.155 --> 03:06:24.817]  G'day there.
[03:06:26.345 --> 03:06:30.008]  Great being here on the Alex Jones Show and what Alex said.
[03:06:30.028 --> 03:06:33.452]  If you don't support him, it's gonna go down.
[03:06:34.513 --> 03:06:35.654]  You don't want that to happen.
[03:06:36.715 --> 03:06:39.838]  It's not only Alex Jones, it's Trends Journal as well.
[03:06:40.538 --> 03:06:43.061]  Support us, keep the truth coming out.
[03:06:43.281 --> 03:06:48.606]  Again, I support InfoWars and my favorite of the favorites
[03:06:49.121 --> 03:06:55.526]  For an old cat like me to keep the juice going is super male vitality.
[03:06:56.047 --> 03:06:56.867]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:06:56.887 --> 03:07:01.471]  I'm going to take a couple of shots right now because I'm getting a little tired.
[03:07:01.511 --> 03:07:02.412]  I need some energy.
[03:07:06.735 --> 03:07:07.135]  Anyway.
[03:07:08.216 --> 03:07:10.698]  So really, the mainstream media is worthless.
[03:07:11.899 --> 03:07:12.460]  Worthless.
[03:07:13.981 --> 03:07:16.643]  Look at the tragedy going on over there in Yemen.
[03:07:18.240 --> 03:07:21.481]  Ask most American people, what do you think about what's going on in Yemen?
[03:07:22.401 --> 03:07:23.482]  They'll say, what's a Yemen?
[03:07:25.723 --> 03:07:26.443]  It's a country.
[03:07:27.983 --> 03:07:30.564]  The worst humanitarian crisis on Earth.
[03:07:33.845 --> 03:07:35.386]  Launched by Saudi Arabia.
[03:07:35.606 --> 03:07:36.886]  Our ally!
[03:07:37.086 --> 03:07:40.067]  Oh, they're great, the democracy of Saudi Arabia.
[03:07:41.288 --> 03:07:41.928]  Wonderful!
[03:07:42.968 --> 03:07:45.309]  How many people did they behead yesterday, you know?
[03:07:47.541 --> 03:07:50.022]  Oh, and the women there, they have all the rights in the world!
[03:07:50.822 --> 03:07:52.642]  Hey, where's the Me Too movement over there?
[03:07:53.903 --> 03:07:54.983]  What hypocrisy!
[03:07:57.023 --> 03:07:58.444]  Media doesn't cover any of it.
[03:08:01.564 --> 03:08:01.865]  Nothing.
[03:08:03.505 --> 03:08:07.726]  So, support InfoWars, and of course, the Trends Journal at TrendsJournal.com.
[03:08:08.226 --> 03:08:10.067]  Going back to gold, this is important.
[03:08:11.947 --> 03:08:12.927]  It's very important.
[03:08:14.068 --> 03:08:15.528]  Gold is the signal
[03:08:16.966 --> 03:08:18.827]  Of what the future is going to look like.
[03:08:20.768 --> 03:08:29.253]  The higher gold goes, the lower the future of the economy and equity markets look.
[03:08:30.393 --> 03:08:33.815]  The higher gold prices, the lower stock prices.
[03:08:35.856 --> 03:08:40.079]  The higher gold prices, the lower GDP growth.
[03:08:41.640 --> 03:08:44.101]  And GDP growth, as I was mentioning earlier,
[03:08:44.949 --> 03:08:46.931]  Is slowing down around the world.
[03:08:47.471 --> 03:08:50.894]  Matter of fact, the World Bank just degraded GDP growth again.
[03:08:51.755 --> 03:08:53.716]  And again, and again, and again, and again, and again.
[03:08:53.736 --> 03:08:55.277]  IMF.
[03:08:56.318 --> 03:09:00.161]  Look what's going on there in Argentina.
[03:09:01.843 --> 03:09:04.045]  Oh, they got wonderful time going over on there.
[03:09:04.065 --> 03:09:06.006]  They only have a 23% unemployment rate.
[03:09:10.418 --> 03:09:17.023]  And they brought in that guy McCree and the Chicago Cats, who are the economic geniuses, I tells ya!
[03:09:17.043 --> 03:09:21.506]  Yeah, from that Milton Friedman school of BS.
[03:09:24.308 --> 03:09:28.451]  Yeah, they only have about, eh, 60% inflation rate.
[03:09:30.652 --> 03:09:32.774]  And then you look what's going on in Venezuela.
[03:09:33.955 --> 03:09:36.296]  Brazil, heading back into recession.
[03:09:39.158 --> 03:09:39.999]  South Africa.
[03:09:41.491 --> 03:09:42.892]  Want to go to the Congo?
[03:09:43.713 --> 03:09:44.973]  How about Sudan?
[03:09:45.834 --> 03:09:47.435]  Take a trip to Algeria.
[03:09:51.298 --> 03:09:52.959]  One country after another.
[03:09:53.819 --> 03:09:54.540]  Going down.
[03:09:56.001 --> 03:09:58.963]  The lower they go, the higher gold goes.
[03:09:59.463 --> 03:10:01.544]  I do not give financial advice.
[03:10:01.564 --> 03:10:03.546]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:10:04.146 --> 03:10:05.487]  I'm not telling you to do anything.
[03:10:05.527 --> 03:10:06.348]  Think for yourself.
[03:10:07.208 --> 03:10:08.369]  I just put the facts out there.
[03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:11.171]  So this is important.
[03:10:12.102 --> 03:10:33.514]  Because I've been negative on gold now for six years, and we are the only magazine in the world, you can look it up, June 6th, a trend alert to all our subscribers, and even our ex-subscribers, telling them this is the beginning of the gold bull run.
[03:10:35.115 --> 03:10:40.558]  The downside risk of gold, as we see it, is only around, eh,
[03:10:43.615 --> 03:10:48.738]  $1,270.
[03:10:43.655 --> 03:10:48.738]  That's not a big downside in the futures markets.
[03:10:49.779 --> 03:10:51.800]  So again, think for yourself.
[03:10:53.621 --> 03:10:54.742]  What do we got here today?
[03:10:55.262 --> 03:10:58.044]  Well, here's the Financial Times.
[03:10:58.064 --> 03:10:58.864]  The U.S.
[03:10:58.904 --> 03:11:03.587]  steps up Tehran warnings as it prepares to unveil fresh sanctions.
[03:11:05.028 --> 03:11:10.271]  As you know, it's not who I like, who I dislike, it's what it is.
[03:11:11.761 --> 03:11:16.363]  I support Trump 100% on the border issues.
[03:11:17.863 --> 03:11:20.364]  As I say, I want a referendum on borders.
[03:11:21.005 --> 03:11:21.885]  Put it on the ballot.
[03:11:22.966 --> 03:11:25.767]  Yes, I want to bring in more illegal immigrants.
[03:11:26.767 --> 03:11:30.188]  And I am willing to pay this amount of money for each one coming in.
[03:11:30.549 --> 03:11:32.209]  You can take it out of my paycheck.
[03:11:33.890 --> 03:11:36.871]  No, I do not want more immigrants coming in.
[03:11:38.792 --> 03:11:41.273]  I will pay this amount of money in taxes.
[03:11:42.059 --> 03:11:43.059]  To secure the borders.
[03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:44.480]  So let the people vote.
[03:11:45.481 --> 03:11:46.021]  Number two.
[03:11:46.541 --> 03:11:49.202]  I support Trump on the trade war issue.
[03:11:50.803 --> 03:11:52.104]  But I have a different outlook.
[03:11:52.144 --> 03:11:53.084]  I don't want tariffs.
[03:11:54.045 --> 03:11:58.527]  I say put back in place the laws that used to exist before Bill Clinton sold us out.
[03:11:59.107 --> 03:12:02.088]  With NAFTA and bringing China into the World Trade Organization.
[03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:07.571]  I'm totally against what's going on in Venezuela.
[03:12:10.020 --> 03:12:15.683]  The only thing that I liked that Obama did was the nuclear deal with Venezuela.
[03:12:17.084 --> 03:12:17.805]  That's about it.
[03:12:18.605 --> 03:12:24.528]  The rest of Obama, folks, was that he kept folking us with his BS.
[03:12:25.529 --> 03:12:32.033]  Did a lovely job in Libya over there, destroying the most prosperous nation in the Middle East.
[03:12:33.053 --> 03:12:36.956]  I gotta tell you, that Assad over there in Syria, he has to go too!
[03:12:37.736 --> 03:12:39.177]  And we'll take those jihadists
[03:12:39.815 --> 03:12:45.637]  Islamic fundamentalists that we use to overthrow Libya, and then we'll send them to Syria.
[03:12:46.958 --> 03:12:49.559]  But we'll call them freedom fighters.
[03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:53.241]  Everything that's got bailed out the banks.
[03:12:54.681 --> 03:12:56.202]  One line, oh, you know, folks!
[03:12:57.002 --> 03:12:59.183]  His first day when he went into office.
[03:13:00.263 --> 03:13:02.084]  We're gonna close Guantanamo.
[03:13:02.664 --> 03:13:03.445]  Within a year.
[03:13:04.045 --> 03:13:04.445]  Folks.
[03:13:05.906 --> 03:13:08.827]  So anyway, folks, folks, folks, folks, folks.
[03:13:09.667 --> 03:13:10.727]  Folk, folk, folk.
[03:13:11.408 --> 03:13:12.808]  It's all he did was focus.
[03:13:14.088 --> 03:13:18.730]  So, I agreed with Obama what he did with Iran.
[03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:25.652]  I disagree what Trump is doing with Iran because I wrote about this in the Trends Journal.
[03:13:25.672 --> 03:13:27.352]  It was the top trend for 2018.
[03:13:28.232 --> 03:13:29.713]  Market shock, mass murder.
[03:13:30.313 --> 03:13:33.194]  United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia going after Iran.
[03:13:34.254 --> 03:13:37.335]  If they attack Iran, if this war breaks out,
[03:13:37.841 --> 03:13:43.783]  You're gonna see oil prices spike to above $100 a barrel, as I said, and it'll bring back down the global economy.
[03:13:44.223 --> 03:13:48.164]  And Iran's not fighting Syria, it's not fighting Libya, it's not fighting Iraq.
[03:13:50.004 --> 03:13:55.926]  You saw how they took out that, depending on whose numbers you look at, that drone that cost about $200 million.
[03:13:56.126 --> 03:13:59.307]  And I think it was way up there.
[03:14:00.087 --> 03:14:02.408]  The Straits of Hormuz aren't that wide.
[03:14:03.648 --> 03:14:03.908]  Ffff!
[03:14:04.068 --> 03:14:04.288]  Ffff!
[03:14:04.448 --> 03:14:04.668]  Ffff!
[03:14:05.388 --> 03:14:07.249]  Missiles going in, ba-ba-boom!
[03:14:08.174 --> 03:14:09.114]  These are the Persians.
[03:14:09.174 --> 03:14:13.776]  They've been around a long time, and they're not going anywhere, like them or not.
[03:14:14.996 --> 03:14:17.957]  But I, Gerald Cilenti, believe in the Founding Fathers.
[03:14:17.977 --> 03:14:24.078]  And the Founding Fathers say, no foreign entanglements.
[03:14:24.739 --> 03:14:34.581]  Beginning with a man that really knew how to fight, not these little boys, called El Presidente of Los Estados Unidos, who couldn't fight the way they'd have a paper bag.
[03:14:34.601 --> 03:14:37.022]  This is George Washington.
[03:14:38.154 --> 03:14:38.474]  Yeah.
[03:14:39.475 --> 03:14:39.715]  Yeah.
[03:14:39.875 --> 03:14:41.015]  Washington, you know.
[03:14:41.836 --> 03:14:42.056]  Yeah.
[03:14:44.497 --> 03:14:45.377]  That Washington.
[03:14:46.377 --> 03:14:47.598]  Course of the Delaware.
[03:14:48.578 --> 03:14:49.059]  Fighting.
[03:14:50.199 --> 03:14:52.020]  No foreign entanglement.
[03:14:53.520 --> 03:14:53.781]  So.
[03:14:54.501 --> 03:14:58.463]  The sanctions that are going on to Iran and what they're doing in Venezuela.
[03:14:59.163 --> 03:15:00.804]  This is economic warfare.
[03:15:02.164 --> 03:15:03.024]  And I'm against it.
[03:15:04.445 --> 03:15:05.706]  Mind your own business.
[03:15:05.826 --> 03:15:06.606]  Stay at home.
[03:15:09.122 --> 03:15:13.744]  200 million bucks and a drone shot down.
[03:15:14.444 --> 03:15:18.726]  And you still can't drink the water in Flint, Michigan.
[03:15:19.386 --> 03:15:26.549]  Oh, and on Friday, over here in New York, Penn Station shut down for a while.
[03:15:27.189 --> 03:15:28.309]  Penn Station?
[03:15:29.250 --> 03:15:31.050]  Yeah, with our Third World Rail.
[03:15:34.672 --> 03:15:36.632]  So I want the money to stay in America.
[03:15:37.433 --> 03:15:38.253]  So this story
[03:15:39.113 --> 03:15:40.074]  About what they're doing here.
[03:15:42.097 --> 03:15:42.938]  More sanctions.
[03:15:43.819 --> 03:15:44.660]  Very serious.
[03:15:46.742 --> 03:15:49.866]  Be back in a little bit.
[03:15:49.886 --> 03:15:56.534]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:15:56.894 --> 03:15:58.416]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:16:10.031 --> 03:16:21.374]  Defiance or rebellion is something that has to be looked at as a neutral statement.
[03:16:23.174 --> 03:16:24.174]  Is defiance bad?
[03:16:25.775 --> 03:16:26.675]  Is rebellion bad?
[03:16:27.835 --> 03:16:28.775]  Is resistance bad?
[03:16:29.335 --> 03:16:34.817]  Well, it really is a question of what are you resisting?
[03:16:35.517 --> 03:16:36.677]  What are you rebelling against?
[03:16:38.871 --> 03:16:47.875]  The left pushes this whole narrative about their rebelling against oppression and their rebelling against people trying to tell them what to do or say, but no one's really telling them what to do or say.
[03:16:48.916 --> 03:16:49.776]  They're in charge.
[03:16:50.096 --> 03:16:51.237]  They run the big tech.
[03:16:51.277 --> 03:16:52.257]  They run the corporations.
[03:16:52.577 --> 03:16:53.738]  They run the society.
[03:16:53.778 --> 03:17:02.442]  They have their agenda, and they're openly the bullies trying to dictate to us how to talk, how to dress, who to have sex with, how to live our lives.
[03:17:04.690 --> 03:17:12.653]  They're constantly lecturing us about microaggressions and telling us that we'll be arrested or taken off Facebook if we don't behave ourselves.
[03:17:12.973 --> 03:17:17.315]  These people are a clear and present danger to free societies.
[03:17:19.036 --> 03:17:24.118]  And so that's what I really want to telegraph to folks is, we know the modern threat to humanity.
[03:17:24.818 --> 03:17:26.239]  Every generation has a threat.
[03:17:27.279 --> 03:17:29.640]  Every generation has a big war.
[03:17:31.288 --> 03:17:35.570]  But this is a political and cultural war, an economic war.
[03:17:36.811 --> 03:17:38.052]  It's raging in 2019.
[03:17:38.552 --> 03:17:48.437]  And the establishment is so angry that organizations like InfoWars are still on air.
[03:17:50.521 --> 03:17:58.947]  They need to have victories because despite their trillions of dollars and their corporate dominance, people are rejecting them on a planetary scale.
[03:17:59.247 --> 03:18:01.489]  Globalism is in full retreat.
[03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:04.591]  It's in full collapse.
[03:18:07.033 --> 03:18:17.760]  And so it's rearing its ugly head and hitting us with every nasty trick it had planned for the future, for their conquest of humanity, and it's still failing.
[03:18:18.741 --> 03:18:19.702]  But for those of us
[03:18:21.010 --> 03:18:26.693]  At the front of the lines, or in the capital ships, we're the targets, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:26.973 --> 03:18:36.818]  And I never thought of InfoWars as a major battleship, or an aircraft carrier, or a destroyer, or a submarine attack group, but the enemy sees it as that because we are.
[03:18:38.119 --> 03:18:45.223]  And it's essential we stay in the fight, and never surrender, and never waver, and never back down, and never give up.
[03:18:46.724 --> 03:19:01.893]  That's why, with all the unprecedented attempts to criminally set us up and put me in prison and shut down this operation that have been all over the national news, we have launched Save InfoWars emergency special that's only running for one week.
[03:19:02.253 --> 03:19:04.234]  50% off all InfoWars life
[03:19:05.213 --> 03:19:10.997]  Nutraceuticals and supplements, free shipping and double Patriot points on your next order instead of 5%, 10%.
[03:19:11.678 --> 03:19:14.200]  That's an additional 10% off every dollar.
[03:19:15.201 --> 03:19:18.343]  Get 50% off all InfoWars Live formulas, free shipping, double Patriot points and more.
[03:19:18.743 --> 03:19:24.808]  This could be your last chance to stock up on top InfoWars Live formulas before they are completely out of stock.
[03:19:26.245 --> 03:19:29.268]  And again, that's the point I've gotten to of having to admit the attack we're under.
[03:19:29.628 --> 03:19:37.676]  The warehouse has confirmed we are already selling out of Survival Shield X2, Dayson Iodine, Super Melon Vitality, and DNA Force Plus.
[03:19:38.296 --> 03:19:43.861]  Now is the time to secure your order before they completely sell out and know that you fund us into the future.
[03:19:44.222 --> 03:19:50.607]  Take advantage of this massive special and support the defense of free speech and reality at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:51.688 --> 03:19:55.290]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven that we're the enemy of tyranny.
[03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:57.932]  We're pro-life, we're pro-God, we're pro-human.
[03:19:58.372 --> 03:20:00.353]  We need your support or we'll be destroyed.
[03:20:00.973 --> 03:20:01.674]  Please support us.
[03:20:05.956 --> 03:20:08.578]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.765 --> 03:20:24.806]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:25.166 --> 03:20:27.366]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:20:27.866 --> 03:20:31.087]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.167 --> 03:20:37.549]  Hey, great being here on The Alex Jones Show, and listen to what Alex just said.
[03:20:37.569 --> 03:20:41.190]  If you don't buy the products, bye-bye.
[03:20:42.411 --> 03:20:44.651]  You need money to keep these things going.
[03:20:45.852 --> 03:20:48.012]  Just like we need it at the Trends Journal here.
[03:20:48.032 --> 03:20:50.673]  We need more subscribers we get, the more we can do.
[03:20:51.584 --> 03:20:53.985]  The more you buy from InfoWars, the more they can do.
[03:20:54.005 --> 03:20:59.586]  And they have great products that I believe in, or else I wouldn't say what I'm saying.
[03:21:00.486 --> 03:21:04.187]  Matter of fact, when you get to Trends Journal, there's no advertising in it.
[03:21:04.207 --> 03:21:06.387]  That'll support anybody.
[03:21:06.587 --> 03:21:11.989]  So when I talk about gold, for example, I don't have gold companies, you know, paying the freight here.
[03:21:12.449 --> 03:21:13.529]  We have subscription banks.
[03:21:14.889 --> 03:21:17.750]  So, going back to what I was talking about with war.
[03:21:19.206 --> 03:21:23.048]  You know, there's a saying that generals are always fighting the last war.
[03:21:24.929 --> 03:21:35.095]  Back in 2000, I was brought over to Virginia Military, VMI, Virginia Military Institute, to talk about New Millennium Warfare.
[03:21:36.035 --> 03:21:37.096]  Come out with my book, Trends 2000.
[03:21:37.296 --> 03:21:47.122]  These F-35s, these aircraft carriers, aircraft carriers
[03:21:48.231 --> 03:21:50.013]  Yesterday's battleships.
[03:21:52.074 --> 03:21:53.776]  All this laser technology.
[03:21:53.816 --> 03:21:55.037]  It's a whole new world.
[03:21:56.658 --> 03:21:57.919]  Cyber warfare.
[03:22:00.241 --> 03:22:01.642]  It's a whole different game.
[03:22:04.925 --> 03:22:05.725]  Not only that.
[03:22:07.326 --> 03:22:10.729]  Poison the systems.
[03:22:13.131 --> 03:22:15.273]  Terrorism like we haven't seen before.
[03:22:16.814 --> 03:22:17.495]  The only way
[03:22:18.632 --> 03:22:23.414]  To a safe future, for me, is peace and prosperity.
[03:22:24.815 --> 03:22:26.656]  The more we spend here, the more we make.
[03:22:28.217 --> 03:22:34.920]  So going back to what I was saying about with Trump, with the trade wars, it's very important.
[03:22:37.121 --> 03:22:41.223]  So 96% of all the clothing that we're wearing comes from overseas.
[03:22:42.423 --> 03:22:43.904]  There's a little story here today.
[03:22:46.009 --> 03:22:47.029]  Financial Times.
[03:22:47.089 --> 03:22:48.210]  This is what I do every day.
[03:22:48.610 --> 03:22:52.271]  I go through the stories and I outline the salient points of them.
[03:22:52.291 --> 03:22:54.591]  There's one over here.
[03:22:55.872 --> 03:22:59.093]  Well, first, before we get there, let's start over here.
[03:23:00.313 --> 03:23:02.674]  Ethiopia hit by regional coup attempt.
[03:23:03.314 --> 03:23:05.654]  Oh, before I mentioned Sudan.
[03:23:05.674 --> 03:23:07.695]  And then we go to the Congo.
[03:23:08.490 --> 03:23:10.931]  Wonderful times going over there in Algeria.
[03:23:11.551 --> 03:23:12.091]  Mali?
[03:23:12.231 --> 03:23:14.252]  Hey, how about going there for a vacation?
[03:23:14.292 --> 03:23:16.112]  Maybe Niger's the place for you.
[03:23:17.753 --> 03:23:20.333]  It's one destabilized area after another.
[03:23:21.534 --> 03:23:22.874]  Let's put it all together.
[03:23:25.075 --> 03:23:27.955]  Ah, jihadi threats spreading across West Africa.
[03:23:28.576 --> 03:23:29.796]  Togo leader warns.
[03:23:30.776 --> 03:23:30.976]  Oop.
[03:23:33.237 --> 03:23:33.557]  All right.
[03:23:34.901 --> 03:23:39.224]  You got a refugee crisis over there and a migrant crisis in Europe?
[03:23:40.164 --> 03:23:41.305]  Hey, where are they coming from?
[03:23:42.746 --> 03:23:43.566]  Ethiopia?
[03:23:44.187 --> 03:23:45.027]  Eritrea?
[03:23:45.688 --> 03:23:46.228]  Where else?
[03:23:46.788 --> 03:23:47.669]  Oh, Congo.
[03:23:48.990 --> 03:23:49.970]  South Africa.
[03:23:52.272 --> 03:23:52.992]  Sudan.
[03:23:53.012 --> 03:23:56.014]  Iraq.
[03:23:57.215 --> 03:23:57.735]  Yemen.
[03:23:58.876 --> 03:23:59.976]  Afghanistan.
[03:24:01.357 --> 03:24:02.798]  One war after another.
[03:24:03.655 --> 03:24:11.996]  But do you know when the, really, refugee crisis, the migrant crisis, started to change the face of Europe?
[03:24:12.116 --> 03:24:11.996]  2011.
[03:24:13.517 --> 03:24:14.757]  Nobody talks about this.
[03:24:14.817 --> 03:24:17.957]  Of course we do, because we wrote about it as it happened in our Trends Journal.
[03:24:19.618 --> 03:24:32.940]  Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, warned, as the United States, France, UK, the Arab League,
[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:36.321]  Backed by NATO, we're overthrowing them.
[03:24:37.821 --> 03:24:44.862]  He warned the Europeans that when he goes, migrants and refugees come over to Europe.
[03:24:46.283 --> 03:24:47.983]  And that's when it all happened.
[03:24:48.783 --> 03:24:52.924]  And you remember Hillary Clinton can't understand why she lost that election.
[03:24:52.964 --> 03:24:53.884]  Must have been the Russians.
[03:24:54.304 --> 03:24:55.945]  Not because people couldn't stand her.
[03:24:57.525 --> 03:24:58.845]  That had nothing to do with it.
[03:24:59.966 --> 03:25:01.606]  Now she's on with CBS.
[03:25:03.015 --> 03:25:07.458]  And they ask you, how did you feel when you found out Omar Qaddafi was murdered?
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:12.362]  We came, we saw, he died!
[03:25:12.382 --> 03:25:13.263]  Hee hee hee!
[03:25:13.943 --> 03:25:16.685]  Can't figure out why Hitler, he lost.
[03:25:17.506 --> 03:25:18.446]  The Russians did it!
[03:25:20.688 --> 03:25:30.215]  Going back, I was talking about trade, and what's going on, and the hypocrisy of war.
[03:25:31.336 --> 03:25:32.317]  When I was a young man,
[03:25:33.556 --> 03:25:34.957]  Vietnam War was going on.
[03:25:36.298 --> 03:25:38.800]  We gotta stop them commies, they says.
[03:25:39.781 --> 03:25:44.284]  We let those commies go into Vietnam, dominoes are gonna keep falling.
[03:25:44.764 --> 03:25:48.587]  And all across Asia, before you know it, they're gonna hit the shores of California.
[03:25:49.128 --> 03:25:50.248]  I'm not making that up.
[03:25:50.669 --> 03:25:52.250]  That was the crap they were telling us.
[03:25:56.513 --> 03:25:59.115]  Now, still a communist country.
[03:26:00.270 --> 03:26:03.552]  But it's okay to do business with them.
[03:26:05.854 --> 03:26:08.416]  Vietnam reaps rewards of U.S.
[03:26:08.516 --> 03:26:09.757]  tariffs on China.
[03:26:11.438 --> 03:26:12.079]  Big story.
[03:26:15.481 --> 03:26:15.701]  U.S.
[03:26:15.802 --> 03:26:23.447]  imports from Vietnam surged nearly 40% in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year.
[03:26:25.329 --> 03:26:28.571]  Overall, during the same period, U.S.
[03:26:28.651 --> 03:26:29.792]  imports from China fell
[03:26:30.890 --> 03:26:35.014]  13%, the second largest contraction since 2009.
[03:26:35.914 --> 03:26:37.636]  2009, why'd it contract?
[03:26:38.556 --> 03:26:39.557]  The Great Recession.
[03:26:40.057 --> 03:26:41.398]  Why is it contracting now?
[03:26:41.979 --> 03:26:43.540]  Not trade wars and tariffs.
[03:26:44.921 --> 03:26:46.402]  It's cheaper labor!
[03:26:48.864 --> 03:26:57.571]  You got companies going from China, getting their stuff made in Vietnam, because the labor's cheaper.
[03:26:59.465 --> 03:27:04.129]  But the hypocrisy of these sick-minded politicians.
[03:27:06.972 --> 03:27:08.193]  I didn't go to Vietnam.
[03:27:09.614 --> 03:27:11.696]  I was too stupid to be against the war.
[03:27:11.716 --> 03:27:21.304]  Of course, they lied about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, just like they lied about Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[03:27:22.125 --> 03:27:25.027]  I see these pictures of guys walking up to water my age.
[03:27:25.388 --> 03:27:26.609]  As a kid, I'm a teenager.
[03:27:27.205 --> 03:27:37.370]  This high in water with a gun over their head and a lot of weight on their back, you know, walking through these rice paddies and stuff and getting shot at?
[03:27:37.390 --> 03:27:39.531]  I couldn't imagine me going there.
[03:27:40.571 --> 03:27:42.492]  So I did everything I could to beat the draft.
[03:27:44.493 --> 03:27:48.635]  I went to college in West Virginia, a greaser from the Bronx in West Virginia.
[03:27:48.655 --> 03:27:51.276]  It was the only school I could get into because my grades were so terrible.
[03:27:52.636 --> 03:27:55.998]  And I got left back in the fifth grade and ran away from kindergarten.
[03:27:56.994 --> 03:28:00.477]  The point being, how they taught us to hate the communists.
[03:28:01.958 --> 03:28:05.480]  But now that we do business with the commie country, nobody cares.
[03:28:06.541 --> 03:28:10.224]  Look how the media sells propaganda, and the politicians.
[03:28:11.084 --> 03:28:14.607]  And speaking of communist countries, how about the biggest one in the world?
[03:28:15.287 --> 03:28:15.808]  China!
[03:28:17.009 --> 03:28:19.951]  Gonna be the world's largest economy very soon.
[03:28:19.971 --> 03:28:22.893]  It's okay.
[03:28:24.114 --> 03:28:25.375]  They're commies we could deal with.
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:31.884]  The business of America's war, the business of China's business, they're buying up the world.
[03:28:33.445 --> 03:28:39.731]  Came back from the Philippines a couple of weeks ago, Chinese buying up everything.
[03:28:39.751 --> 03:28:42.153]  Going back to the hypocrisy, why I'm against war?
[03:28:42.793 --> 03:28:48.198]  Because the freaks and fools and psychopaths and sociopaths that send us there, they never go.
[03:28:48.218 --> 03:28:53.702]  They only send you, and your kids, not the senators' son.
[03:28:54.823 --> 03:28:55.984]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[03:29:03.123 --> 03:29:08.846]  This is CNN.
[03:29:09.586 --> 03:29:12.008]  So here's Lefto, but there's good news!
[03:29:13.548 --> 03:29:20.211]  I don't just come on air, willy-nilly, without something to offer ya!
[03:29:20.972 --> 03:29:25.694]  Not only is Lefto the Clown here live for this segment, but I got good news!
[03:29:26.734 --> 03:29:27.695]  You see, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:29:29.949 --> 03:29:32.950]  Lefto the Clown has friends out there in the political community.
[03:29:33.350 --> 03:29:35.091]  A lot of them are in the government.
[03:29:35.411 --> 03:29:40.993]  And some of them want to be President of the United States!
[03:29:42.434 --> 03:29:43.134]  That's right!
[03:29:43.974 --> 03:29:48.956]  Some of Lefto's buddies are running for President of the United States!
[03:29:49.896 --> 03:29:54.258]  Now I know you're out there probably jumping for joy, but hold your horses!
[03:29:55.276 --> 03:29:58.702]  Because there's even more to be excited about!
[03:29:59.683 --> 03:30:09.098]  Not just that Lefto's friends are running for president, but that next week, they will be hosting a clown show!
[03:30:10.253 --> 03:30:11.373]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen!
[03:30:11.854 --> 03:30:16.735]  Next week, the Democrats are having their first presidential debates!
[03:30:17.856 --> 03:30:19.136]  And you know what that means!
[03:30:19.736 --> 03:30:21.757]  It's the Clown World Show!
[03:30:21.817 --> 03:30:23.698]  The greatest comedy show on Earth!
[03:30:24.158 --> 03:30:25.698]  The first Democrat debate!
[03:30:26.379 --> 03:30:38.563]  But ladies and gentlemen, we're so committed to your entertainment, we're so committed to you getting the full picture, we're so committed to the Clown World, we're gonna shake it up a bit!
[03:30:39.777 --> 03:30:54.966]  Not only do we have one night of presidential Democrat debates, we give you two nights of The Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth, and the best news is yet to come!
[03:30:56.147 --> 03:31:01.470]  It's all gonna be streamed live at InfoWars.com slash show!
[03:31:02.891 --> 03:31:07.754]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[03:31:30.094 --> 03:31:34.275]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[03:31:35.215 --> 03:31:38.417]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.

[03:34:04.265 --> 03:34:11.449]  Get 50 percent off on all InfoWars life formulas, free shipping, double Patriot points and more.
[03:34:11.849 --> 03:34:17.872]  This could be your last chance to stock up on InfoWars life formulas.
[03:34:18.476 --> 03:34:21.718]  Before they are completely out of stock.
[03:34:22.278 --> 03:34:33.485]  The warehouse has confirmed they're already selling out of Survival Shield X2, Nascent Iodine, Supermail Vitality, and DNA Force.
[03:34:33.525 --> 03:34:40.028]  And the reason they're selling out of Supermail Vitality is I just bought a lot of it because I gotta keep that vitality going.
[03:34:40.509 --> 03:34:44.171]  So remember, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:34:44.969 --> 03:34:51.053]  And of course, consider subscribing to our magazine, The Trends Journal, if you want to read history before it happens.
[03:34:51.073 --> 03:34:57.436]  I was talking before about gold, and why gold prices are going up.
[03:34:59.157 --> 03:35:05.841]  They're going up because all around the world, the economies are going down, and they're making their money more cheaper.
[03:35:06.782 --> 03:35:09.904]  Here's a story, again, in the Financial Times.
[03:35:10.984 --> 03:35:11.905]  Feeble lift.
[03:35:14.073 --> 03:35:18.674]  The Eurozone raises prospects of future stimulus.
[03:35:20.194 --> 03:35:25.155]  Economic conditions of business in the Eurozone showed only modest signs of improvement in June.
[03:35:27.876 --> 03:35:38.017]  Manufacturing, hard hit by global economic uncertainty, continued to repeat a fall in activity levels.
[03:35:40.798 --> 03:35:41.518]  So there you got it.
[03:35:43.439 --> 03:35:44.139]  This is important.
[03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:55.126]  The IHS, Market Purchasing Managers Index, it's only at 51.8 May.
[03:35:56.506 --> 03:35:59.588]  Anything below 50 is called contraction.
[03:36:04.091 --> 03:36:13.276]  The Eurozone economy remains stuck in low gear, said Eduardo Campanella, an economist with Unicredit.
[03:36:14.551 --> 03:36:16.012]  Why am I making a point of this?
[03:36:17.813 --> 03:36:18.553]  Stimulus!
[03:36:19.994 --> 03:36:20.754]  Stimulus!
[03:36:21.855 --> 03:36:26.257]  As I say, they didn't teach you this in Economics 101 in graduate school.
[03:36:27.438 --> 03:36:43.506]  Quantitative easing, negative interest rates, the German Bund, the French Bond, are all 10-year bonds, are now in
[03:36:44.182 --> 03:36:45.363]  Negative yields.
[03:36:45.643 --> 03:36:50.465]  That means you buy it and in 10 years you get less than what you bought it for.
[03:36:51.485 --> 03:36:52.526]  Can't make this stuff up.
[03:36:52.546 --> 03:36:55.087]  And you know what they're doing?
[03:36:55.467 --> 03:36:56.248]  Same in Japan.
[03:36:57.588 --> 03:37:03.271]  What they're doing is they're buying up their own bonds, corporate and government.
[03:37:05.812 --> 03:37:12.215]  And the Japanese head of the central bank also announced
[03:37:13.544 --> 03:37:14.365]  More stimulus.
[03:37:15.666 --> 03:37:16.786]  Going back to gold.
[03:37:17.207 --> 03:37:18.888]  They're devaluing the currency.
[03:37:19.508 --> 03:37:23.131]  Here's a story, also in the Financial Times.
[03:37:23.771 --> 03:37:31.637]  Dollar set to lose its luster as Fed's dovish stance conspires with G20 talks against the greenback.
[03:37:33.118 --> 03:37:33.599]  Here it is.
[03:37:35.260 --> 03:37:38.342]  Oh, so the lowering interest rates, the dollar's going to get cheaper, right?
[03:37:38.742 --> 03:37:39.263]  And it is.
[03:37:40.483 --> 03:37:41.244]  What are you going to buy?
[03:37:41.264 --> 03:37:42.325]  The euro?
[03:37:44.056 --> 03:37:50.081]  With more stimulus, they dumped in nearly 3 trillion dollars of quantitative easing.
[03:37:51.342 --> 03:37:51.883]  Did nothing.
[03:37:52.463 --> 03:37:58.308]  Oh, by the way, Italy announced they're going to have a bigger budget deficit and they don't care about what Brussels says.
[03:37:58.929 --> 03:38:00.530]  Because they've got to pump their economy up.
[03:38:02.152 --> 03:38:09.938]  So the more these countries devalue their currency, and I want to keep going over this, the higher gold prices are going to go.
[03:38:11.139 --> 03:38:11.760]  I mentioned
[03:38:14.406 --> 03:38:15.327]  Argentina before.
[03:38:16.227 --> 03:38:17.528]  Suppose you live in Argentina.
[03:38:17.708 --> 03:38:19.309]  You're seeing inflation skyrocket.
[03:38:19.870 --> 03:38:21.431]  By the way, you know what the interest rate is?
[03:38:22.211 --> 03:38:22.411]  About 60%.
[03:38:22.511 --> 03:38:25.874]  So who's borrowing money?
[03:38:25.934 --> 03:38:26.334]  Nobody.
[03:38:27.895 --> 03:38:30.797]  And they're doing that high interest rate because to stop inflation.
[03:38:32.298 --> 03:38:44.006]  So if you have Argentinian peso, and you bought gold a while ago when it was way down, and now your peso
[03:38:44.804 --> 03:38:46.444]  Gold is way down and gold is way up.
[03:38:46.604 --> 03:38:48.505]  Gold is at a six-year high now.
[03:38:49.445 --> 03:38:51.345]  That's why I'm talking about it the way it is.
[03:38:52.025 --> 03:38:54.986]  It's spiked to a six-year high like that.
[03:38:56.306 --> 03:38:58.906]  What would you rather have, your peso or gold?
[03:39:00.487 --> 03:39:04.707]  If you're living in Venezuela, where they got an inflation rate of a couple of million percent?
[03:39:06.108 --> 03:39:07.108]  I'm not making that up.
[03:39:07.868 --> 03:39:13.569]  What would you rather have, boulevards or gold?
[03:39:14.932 --> 03:39:16.732]  Look what's going on over there in Turkey.
[03:39:18.633 --> 03:39:20.473]  They just had another election over there.
[03:39:21.893 --> 03:39:25.514]  After Erdogan called it for another election in Istanbul.
[03:39:27.914 --> 03:39:31.495]  And the guy that they said who really lost, he won bigger.
[03:39:32.395 --> 03:39:33.155]  And you know why?
[03:39:33.895 --> 03:39:37.076]  Because Turkey's economy's going down.
[03:39:37.836 --> 03:39:39.516]  You want to hold that Turkish lira?
[03:39:40.276 --> 03:39:41.476]  Or do you want to buy gold?
[03:39:42.497 --> 03:39:44.297]  That's why gold is going up.
[03:39:45.410 --> 03:39:46.871]  It's all over the world.
[03:39:46.911 --> 03:39:48.551]  The economies are going down.
[03:39:48.571 --> 03:39:51.732]  And they're going to do anything they can to pump them up.
[03:39:54.793 --> 03:39:56.374]  Destabilization everywhere.
[03:39:57.054 --> 03:39:57.814]  Name the country.
[03:40:00.095 --> 03:40:07.658]  Huge Prague protests turn up heat on Babis to quit as the Czech Prime Minister.
[03:40:09.958 --> 03:40:14.280]  Hundreds of thousands of Czechs rallied in Prague yesterday.
[03:40:15.390 --> 03:40:30.697]  The call for the resignation of Prime Minister Babis in the largest protests in Central European country since the collapse of communism in 1989.
[03:40:34.158 --> 03:40:37.160]  Look what's going on over there in Hong Kong.
[03:40:39.221 --> 03:40:41.802]  Two million people taken to the streets
[03:40:42.571 --> 03:40:45.832]  In a place where they got, what, about seven and a half million people.
[03:40:45.852 --> 03:40:49.713]  In the United States, you don't get anybody protesting.
[03:40:50.854 --> 03:40:56.015]  They had a big, you know, that pink hat thing, remember, a couple of years ago?
[03:40:56.035 --> 03:41:01.937]  A million people turned out all over the country, with 320 million people.
[03:41:03.037 --> 03:41:09.259]  They go out for one day, go down to Washington Mall, they take the bus back, and that's the end of it.
[03:41:09.879 --> 03:41:10.700]  1989, you know what happened in 1989?
[03:41:12.509 --> 03:41:13.890]  The Berlin Wall fell.
[03:41:14.010 --> 03:41:14.751]  You know why?
[03:41:14.771 --> 03:41:17.592]  Because the people went out and protested.
[03:41:18.233 --> 03:41:19.714]  And then more came and they stayed.
[03:41:20.094 --> 03:41:21.395]  And more came and they stayed.
[03:41:21.695 --> 03:41:23.176]  And more came and they stayed.
[03:41:24.217 --> 03:41:25.738]  In America, you just stay at home.
[03:41:28.620 --> 03:41:30.842]  Or you go on social media now.
[03:41:32.323 --> 03:41:33.683]  No fight in this country.
[03:41:34.884 --> 03:41:41.649]  That's why we got freaks and fools in charge in a city, state, and government near you.
[03:41:42.591 --> 03:41:43.812]  Who's your favorite freak?
[03:41:44.852 --> 03:41:48.634]  Diane Notso Feinstein or little Lindsey Graham?
[03:41:49.454 --> 03:41:51.435]  Now I know you like Chuckie Schumer.
[03:41:52.275 --> 03:41:54.236]  Ah, Mitch McConnell's your kind of guy.
[03:41:55.177 --> 03:41:58.898]  Look at the freaks and fools running and ruining our lives.
[03:41:59.939 --> 03:42:00.999]  No protests.
[03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:04.341]  Steal our dough, give it to the bigs.
[03:42:06.042 --> 03:42:06.382]  The 1% that get
[03:42:09.765 --> 03:42:20.432]  To the 0.1% as they keep getting more and more dough as all we become are workers on the global, multinational plantation of Slavelandia.
[03:42:21.673 --> 03:42:23.715]  So it's up to the people to change this around.
[03:42:26.076 --> 03:42:26.977]  And you're in charge.
[03:42:30.319 --> 03:42:32.841]  So, are you going to sit back and do nothing?
[03:42:35.259 --> 03:42:36.319]  Don't forget to vote!
[03:42:37.020 --> 03:42:38.020]  Why are they gonna vote?
[03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:39.421]  I'm not gonna vote for these freaks.
[03:42:41.642 --> 03:42:42.562]  We need a new party.
[03:42:43.522 --> 03:42:44.103]  In a new way.
[03:42:45.103 --> 03:42:45.963]  And you can make it happen.
[03:42:46.383 --> 03:42:48.284]  But remember, support InfoWare.
[03:42:48.304 --> 03:42:49.785]  We'll be back in a bit.
[03:43:07.762 --> 03:43:10.644]  Announcing the greatest show on earth!
[03:43:11.024 --> 03:43:16.166]  Reparations, free healthcare, free college, free homes, free money forever!
[03:43:16.407 --> 03:43:17.267]  Yay!
[03:43:17.587 --> 03:43:18.748]  It's Cloud World 2019!
[03:43:18.988 --> 03:43:25.391]  The Democratic Party's two-night extravaganza debate!
[03:43:25.671 --> 03:43:27.252]  Let's meet the candidates!
[03:43:28.132 --> 03:43:28.912]  All-Star!
[03:43:29.052 --> 03:43:29.973]  Beto O'Rourke!
[03:43:30.693 --> 03:43:31.433]  Oh my gosh!
[03:43:31.513 --> 03:43:32.593]  Cory Booker!
[03:43:32.653 --> 03:43:34.154]  The Amazing!
[03:43:34.414 --> 03:43:34.634]  Oh!
[03:43:34.714 --> 03:43:36.014]  Pocahontas!
[03:43:36.635 --> 03:43:37.955]  Joe Biden!
[03:43:38.495 --> 03:43:39.596]  Swallow's Whale System!
[03:43:39.696 --> 03:43:40.696]  New gun owners!
[03:43:40.796 --> 03:43:41.256]  Yay!
[03:43:41.676 --> 03:43:43.337]  Bernie Sanders!
[03:43:43.437 --> 03:43:44.897]  Love the Soviet Union!
[03:43:45.257 --> 03:43:46.478]  Kamala Harris!
[03:43:46.658 --> 03:43:47.918]  And so many more!
[03:43:48.398 --> 03:43:49.739]  It's the greatest show on earth!
[03:43:50.119 --> 03:43:53.860]  Head to polewars.com forward slash show with live coverage next week!
[03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:57.544]  Wednesday and Thursday night.
[03:44:05.325 --> 03:44:06.965]  Folks, you want people to fight for America.
[03:44:07.326 --> 03:44:09.166]  You want people to stand up and say no to the globalists.
[03:44:09.426 --> 03:44:12.747]  You want people to report on the Clintons and all the pedophile rings that are now in the news.
[03:44:13.167 --> 03:44:16.628]  You want people to, you know, expose globalism or the Islamic invasion.
[03:44:16.868 --> 03:44:18.909]  We're doing it, and we're not backing down.
[03:44:19.069 --> 03:44:21.549]  And we're exposing the Covington hoax first.
[03:44:21.649 --> 03:44:22.450]  We expose it first.
[03:44:22.490 --> 03:44:23.490]  We're exposing it all.
[03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:24.950]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:44:25.010 --> 03:44:25.770]  You are the tip of the spear.
[03:44:25.790 --> 03:44:31.332]  And that's why everybody has to remember, we're running a Save Infowars special right now.
[03:44:31.892 --> 03:44:34.634]  To get more capital in because we've not been able to expand.
[03:44:34.654 --> 03:44:36.395]  We've actually been contracting some.
[03:44:36.535 --> 03:44:38.316]  The enemy has been winning with all their attacks.
[03:44:38.336 --> 03:44:46.841]  We're still reaching a lot of people thanks to you, but we need capital to get more reporters in the field to launch a bunch of stuff we've got ready to do that is going to devastate the globalists.
[03:44:47.001 --> 03:44:49.183]  We've proven we don't talk, we deliver.
[03:44:49.223 --> 03:44:50.263]  But I need war bonds.
[03:44:50.344 --> 03:44:51.044]  I need capital.
[03:44:51.184 --> 03:44:52.365]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:44:52.565 --> 03:44:53.586]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:44:54.446 --> 03:44:54.646]  50% off.
[03:44:54.706 --> 03:44:55.787]  Double Patriot points.
[03:44:56.007 --> 03:44:59.952]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[03:45:00.132 --> 03:45:03.215]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[03:45:03.255 --> 03:45:09.863]  We've got a bunch of new Made in America shirts with really soft designer fabric and really the highest quality imprints.
[03:45:10.063 --> 03:45:14.509]  The shirts are costing us up to $15 a piece and we're selling them on sale for $19.99.
[03:45:15.029 --> 03:45:18.232]  As I said the other day, and I said to the people in the press, your case is the template case.
[03:45:35.288 --> 03:45:36.949]  For American freedom moving forward.
[03:45:37.290 --> 03:45:41.152]  And see whether or not they can break the InfoWars base.
[03:45:41.373 --> 03:45:46.176]  Whether or not they can stop the InfoWars audience from supporting the InfoWars network.
[03:45:46.216 --> 03:45:52.901]  Because again, like you said in corporate documents, the model of self-funding, self-sales is the thing that corporations, the globalists fear.
[03:45:53.221 --> 03:45:57.244]  Because crowdsourcing and individuals doing this scares the living daylights out of them.
[03:45:57.344 --> 03:45:57.804]  Absolutely.
[03:45:57.824 --> 03:46:01.885]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square.
[03:46:01.905 --> 03:46:13.909]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:46:14.049 --> 03:46:26.433]  It is an old-school, American, 1776-style experiment in the expression of the freedom from press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize
[03:46:26.793 --> 03:46:45.322]  Organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[03:46:45.382 --> 03:46:52.946]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age of ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[03:46:53.326 --> 03:46:58.169]  Of deplatforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[03:47:06.454 --> 03:47:09.056]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.175 --> 03:47:35.099]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:35.779 --> 03:47:39.642]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:42.074 --> 03:47:45.716]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.
[03:47:45.836 --> 03:48:01.844]  Remember, don't forget, don't forget, save InfoWars Emergency Special 50% off on all InfoWars life formulas, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:48:02.604 --> 03:48:07.747]  And again, I do what I can to support InfoWars in every way that I can.
[03:48:08.706 --> 03:48:11.547]  I was mentioning about what's going on in the world and destabilization.
[03:48:11.587 --> 03:48:12.468]  Again, all going back.
[03:48:13.028 --> 03:48:16.769]  Our formula, by the way, for forecasting trends is called globalnomic.
[03:48:17.310 --> 03:48:21.311]  It means making connections between different fields and looking global and doing it.
[03:48:22.312 --> 03:48:24.713]  So, in other words, you just don't look at economics.
[03:48:25.533 --> 03:48:30.335]  You have to look at social change, geopolitics, healthcare, whatever it might be.
[03:48:30.355 --> 03:48:34.237]  And, another story.
[03:48:34.895 --> 03:48:35.676]  Talking about gold.
[03:48:35.836 --> 03:48:41.100]  Protests in Algeria as prominent figures arrested in graft probe.
[03:48:42.401 --> 03:48:54.830]  Protests used crowds demanded departure of the interim president, who they see as part of the old guard that has run the North African country since independence from France in 1962.
[03:48:57.032 --> 03:49:01.015]  Again, millions of people taking to the streets.
[03:49:02.336 --> 03:49:04.538]  They fight for freedom.
[03:49:05.660 --> 03:49:06.620]  From their dictators.
[03:49:07.581 --> 03:49:08.421]  But Americans?
[03:49:09.762 --> 03:49:10.762]  Not a lot of fight.
[03:49:11.842 --> 03:49:15.184]  And that's why you need to support InfoWars and of course the Trends Journal.
[03:49:15.384 --> 03:49:17.945]  The Trends Journal if you want to know history before it happens.
[03:49:19.065 --> 03:49:24.247]  We were talking before about what happened when the refugee crisis and how it's worsening.
[03:49:25.047 --> 03:49:26.388]  It's only going to get much worse.
[03:49:27.848 --> 03:49:32.750]  The number of refugees is soaring to records.
[03:49:33.731 --> 03:49:34.251]  That's right.
[03:49:36.701 --> 03:49:44.225]  The number of people fleeing violence is the highest recorded since World War II.
[03:49:46.666 --> 03:49:48.668]  And this is according to the United Nations.
[03:49:49.668 --> 03:49:57.673]  The global population of people displaced by conflict reached 70.8 million people last year.
[03:49:57.693 --> 03:49:59.514]  You ready for this?
[03:50:01.455 --> 03:50:01.875]  You ready?
[03:50:06.687 --> 03:50:12.951]  From a little over 43 million a decade ago.
[03:50:14.592 --> 03:50:20.896]  Around 80% of the world's refugees have been living in exile for five years.
[03:50:24.858 --> 03:50:25.458]  Wars.
[03:50:26.959 --> 03:50:29.521]  He didn't have this problem before 9-11.
[03:50:31.182 --> 03:50:32.903]  And then he gave us the Afghan War.
[03:50:34.164 --> 03:50:35.104]  He didn't like that one.
[03:50:35.124 --> 03:50:36.365]  How about the Iraq War?
[03:50:37.594 --> 03:50:39.836]  I got a Libyan war that you'll just love.
[03:50:41.077 --> 03:50:41.838]  You like that one?
[03:50:41.878 --> 03:50:43.680]  I got a Syrian war for you.
[03:50:47.403 --> 03:50:51.127]  Over 10 million Syrians have been displaced.
[03:50:53.229 --> 03:50:55.151]  About 5 million of them left the country.
[03:50:55.171 --> 03:50:57.713]  It was a very prosperous place at one time.
[03:50:58.674 --> 03:51:00.195]  And a great tourist destination.
[03:51:02.438 --> 03:51:02.758]  Gone.
[03:51:05.691 --> 03:51:09.754]  But nobody talks about the wars that are causing the migrant immigration problem.
[03:51:09.774 --> 03:51:20.081]  You know, before I was talking about the wars and how we were taught to hate the commies.
[03:51:22.243 --> 03:51:30.469]  I want to make this clear how we're listening to stupid, ignorant people most of our life.
[03:51:32.350 --> 03:51:34.812]  I told you when I was a kid, the Gulf of Tonkin incident,
[03:51:35.438 --> 03:51:37.099]  We didn't know it was a lie.
[03:51:37.119 --> 03:51:43.322]  The reason they had protests back then was because they had the draft.
[03:51:44.223 --> 03:51:45.403]  Now they don't have the draft.
[03:51:46.644 --> 03:51:48.165]  So, no protest.
[03:51:48.965 --> 03:51:52.187]  Now remember, I'm a little kid in grammar school.
[03:51:53.187 --> 03:51:54.668]  And we gotta hate them Russians.
[03:51:55.468 --> 03:51:55.849]  Alright?
[03:51:57.269 --> 03:51:58.810]  So they had air raid drills.
[03:52:00.351 --> 03:52:02.132]  They had us hiding under desks.
[03:52:05.137 --> 03:52:06.338]  Frightened out of your mind.
[03:52:07.179 --> 03:52:07.619]  Siren.
[03:52:09.141 --> 03:52:10.302]  All right, go under your desks.
[03:52:11.303 --> 03:52:12.364]  You had adults.
[03:52:13.044 --> 03:52:14.286]  These are called teachers.
[03:52:14.326 --> 03:52:18.790]  You want to know why the education in this country stinks?
[03:52:19.490 --> 03:52:25.496]  Because if it was worth anything, you'd think we'd be in these problems if we had educated people.
[03:52:26.764 --> 03:52:36.311]  These are the morons that got kids going under the desk because they were stupid enough to believe the BS.
[03:52:38.593 --> 03:52:42.696]  And then they tell you, if you see a flash, don't look at it.
[03:52:44.037 --> 03:52:45.218]  I'm not making this up.
[03:52:46.939 --> 03:52:49.020]  You see a flash, don't look at it.
[03:52:49.861 --> 03:52:51.082]  You're dust!
[03:52:51.963 --> 03:52:52.443]  Oh no!
[03:52:52.563 --> 03:52:55.025]  I was saved because I was hiding under the desk!
[03:52:56.164 --> 03:52:58.785]  You had adults telling you to do this crap!
[03:53:00.445 --> 03:53:01.346]  All over the country!
[03:53:02.666 --> 03:53:07.128]  You got the same stupid people telling you what to do now.
[03:53:08.548 --> 03:53:10.129]  I said, what will change things?
[03:53:10.889 --> 03:53:12.109]  Direct democracy.
[03:53:12.929 --> 03:53:13.890]  Let the people vote.
[03:53:14.250 --> 03:53:14.990]  Want to go to war?
[03:53:15.230 --> 03:53:15.990]  Let the people vote.
[03:53:16.491 --> 03:53:18.831]  Hey, you want that 5G that's coming in?
[03:53:19.151 --> 03:53:19.392]  Foof!
[03:53:19.932 --> 03:53:21.392]  It's gonna radiate you to death.
[03:53:21.872 --> 03:53:22.713]  Oh, don't believe me?
[03:53:22.773 --> 03:53:23.773]  Read it in the Trends Journal.
[03:53:24.901 --> 03:53:27.722]  You like those radio frequency radiations hitting you?
[03:53:28.482 --> 03:53:30.522]  Oh, yeah, they're great!
[03:53:33.863 --> 03:53:35.043]  They'll tell you what to do.
[03:53:35.103 --> 03:53:36.484]  You have no right to speak up.
[03:53:38.984 --> 03:53:41.505]  You got ignorant people telling you what to do.
[03:53:42.165 --> 03:53:43.265]  Direct democracy.
[03:53:43.305 --> 03:53:44.166]  Let the people vote.
[03:53:44.846 --> 03:53:46.426]  Oh, the people are too stupid.
[03:53:47.046 --> 03:53:47.966]  Yeah, like I said.
[03:53:50.447 --> 03:53:52.147]  Nancy out of her mind Pelosi.
[03:53:52.347 --> 03:53:54.188]  Oh, she's a lot smarter than me and you.
[03:53:56.033 --> 03:53:56.714]  Oh yeah!
[03:53:58.075 --> 03:54:00.517]  Let's bring Biden back!
[03:54:00.957 --> 03:54:02.598]  There's a brilliant guy!
[03:54:02.618 --> 03:54:08.403]  You got one jerk after another, both parties.
[03:54:09.684 --> 03:54:11.565]  Direct democracy and we could do it.
[03:54:12.606 --> 03:54:15.208]  We could do it with blockchain democracy.
[03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:23.634]  And blockchain democracy means, if banks could send trillions of dollars around the world,
[03:54:26.394 --> 03:54:28.835]  Once the transaction is made, it's blocked.
[03:54:30.175 --> 03:54:31.676]  We could have blockchain voting.
[03:54:32.556 --> 03:54:34.697]  You could vote on your computer, you could vote off your phone.
[03:54:34.777 --> 03:54:35.597]  Oh, they'll hack it.
[03:54:36.197 --> 03:54:39.058]  Oh yeah, like the system we have now is so great.
[03:54:39.558 --> 03:54:42.700]  They still got them hanging chads down there in Florida.
[03:54:43.660 --> 03:54:45.921]  Look at the 2018 elections.
[03:54:45.961 --> 03:54:47.601]  They finished counting the votes yet?
[03:54:50.262 --> 03:54:52.403]  And this could be open for anybody to look at.
[03:54:53.663 --> 03:54:55.984]  Let the people decide our future.
[03:54:59.108 --> 03:55:01.489]  Switzerland hasn't been in a war since 1850.
[03:55:01.569 --> 03:55:03.669]  It's one of the richest countries in the world.
[03:55:03.749 --> 03:55:04.729]  War all around them.
[03:55:04.769 --> 03:55:06.570]  World War I, World War II, on and on.
[03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:08.390]  People vote.
[03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:10.731]  You don't know who the president of Switzerland is.
[03:55:11.331 --> 03:55:13.512]  I don't need anybody telling me what to do.
[03:55:16.432 --> 03:55:19.033]  I pay my taxes talking about education.
[03:55:19.633 --> 03:55:27.075]  My God, the stupid school system we have here run by an arrogant guy that's superintendent in Kingston.
[03:55:28.041 --> 03:55:30.723]  The taxes I gotta pay for the school, and I never had any kids.
[03:55:31.183 --> 03:55:32.083]  Here's the way I see it.
[03:55:32.384 --> 03:55:36.246]  The more children you have, the more money you should pay to get them educated.
[03:55:36.446 --> 03:55:37.287]  That's your decision.
[03:55:37.627 --> 03:55:38.387]  I'll give something.
[03:55:40.489 --> 03:55:41.369]  And that's another one.
[03:55:42.030 --> 03:55:42.850]  Online learning.
[03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:48.233]  Interactive U. I wrote about this in my book, Trends 2000, back in the late 90s.
[03:55:48.573 --> 03:55:53.016]  The system we have is antiquated, designed by the Germans for the Industrial Revolution.
[03:55:53.536 --> 03:55:55.217]  Way out of touch with the times.
[03:55:56.658 --> 03:55:57.339]  Interactive U.
[03:55:58.359 --> 03:56:00.461]  Direct democracy, blockchain voting.
[03:56:01.822 --> 03:56:03.404]  We need to change the system.
[03:56:06.327 --> 03:56:14.134]  They were calling it, you know, before when they're talking about the presidential race going on, I call it the presidential reality show.
[03:56:15.416 --> 03:56:17.878]  And let's face it, we got a reality show champion.
[03:56:18.513 --> 03:56:20.034]  As a President of the United States.
[03:56:20.514 --> 03:56:21.935]  And again, I'm a political atheist.
[03:56:22.335 --> 03:56:27.518]  Trends Journal, it's a fact, was the first magazine to call Trump a winner in May of 2016.
[03:56:28.098 --> 03:56:30.239]  Against all the polls.
[03:56:30.899 --> 03:56:32.240]  So I just call it like I see it.
[03:56:33.541 --> 03:56:41.104]  And as I see it now, I don't want a democrat or a repulsive kid in office telling me what to do.
[03:56:43.566 --> 03:56:45.907]  It's time for we the people to be we the people.
[03:56:47.313 --> 03:56:50.434]  And I'm a Democrat, I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative, I'm a liberal.
[03:56:51.214 --> 03:56:51.674]  Save it.
[03:56:52.734 --> 03:56:53.554]  It's kids' stuff.
[03:56:56.135 --> 03:56:57.035]  It's a rigged game.
[03:56:58.235 --> 03:56:59.736]  Campaign contributions?
[03:57:00.536 --> 03:57:01.896]  How about bribes and payoffs?
[03:57:02.616 --> 03:57:11.558]  Oh, matter of fact, Pocahontas over there, I heard her name, Elizabeth Warren, she wants to get rid of the monopolies in the tech world?
[03:57:12.538 --> 03:57:13.018]  Guess what?
[03:57:13.518 --> 03:57:14.839]  The biggest private donors?
[03:57:15.739 --> 03:57:16.299]  Contributors?
[03:57:17.244 --> 03:57:18.065]  From the tech world.
[03:57:18.805 --> 03:57:19.186]  Got it?
[03:57:20.226 --> 03:57:21.367]  We need a new system.
[03:57:22.548 --> 03:57:24.730]  Again, it's up to you.
[03:57:25.190 --> 03:57:26.892]  And keep InfoWars going.
[03:57:27.832 --> 03:57:28.993]  Keep buying their products.
[03:57:29.073 --> 03:57:29.594]  They're great.
[03:57:30.394 --> 03:57:37.280]  And consider subscribing to the Trends Journal at TrendsJournal.com, the only place where you'll read history before it happens.
[03:57:38.220 --> 03:57:39.261]  Keep the truth alive.
[03:57:40.142 --> 03:57:41.143]  Stand by your word.
[03:57:42.003 --> 03:57:42.864]  See you the next time.
[03:57:43.124 --> 03:57:45.526]  And thanks for having me on InfoWars.
[03:57:45.986 --> 03:57:46.367]  Bye-bye.
[03:57:52.827 --> 03:57:57.051]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on earth.
[03:57:57.772 --> 03:57:58.773]  Clown World.
[03:58:00.234 --> 03:58:04.138]  20 socialist, globalist, communist candidates.
[03:58:05.159 --> 03:58:08.143]  All in one spot for two nights only.
[03:58:08.543 --> 03:58:14.089]  And you're gonna have uncensored, unbridled, pure analysis like no one else can do it.
[03:58:14.429 --> 03:58:17.091]  Clown World, the greatest comedy show on Earth.
[03:58:17.351 --> 03:58:20.733]  Two nights only, 20 candidates, and tons of laughs.
[03:58:21.314 --> 03:58:23.055]  June 26th and 27th.
[03:58:23.095 --> 03:58:25.376]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m.
[03:58:25.857 --> 03:58:28.919]  at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:58:29.459 --> 03:58:31.040]  It's the greatest show on Earth.
[03:58:31.500 --> 03:58:36.944]  A bunch of parasites, bitching and complaining, working for the shycoms to overthrow America.
[03:58:37.424 --> 03:58:44.209]  Join us next Wednesday and Thursday for Clown World, the biggest show on Earth!
[03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:46.052]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[03:58:46.412 --> 03:58:46.933]  I'm P.T.
[03:58:46.953 --> 03:58:47.294]  Barnum.
[03:58:47.674 --> 03:58:48.576]  I love the Democrats.
[03:58:48.996 --> 03:58:54.264]  Beto O'Rourke says the world's ending in 11 years and the borders should be open.
[03:58:54.285 --> 03:58:55.807]  There's so many other clowns.
[03:58:56.127 --> 03:58:58.751]  Cory Booker says pay reparations even if 98% of whites
