[00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:08.655]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:14.377]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:18.079]  All right.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:31.265]  It's Thursday, January 10th, 2019, and I was going to have a workday here on a bunch of projects that are behind schedule because of me.
[00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.503]  Not making time to get them done.
[00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:39.706]  And Owen Schroyer, who hosts the Warm Every Day at 3 o'clock Central, was going to be hosting.
[00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:49.794]  But I'm just going to be here in the first two segments today, and you've got to forgive me, too.
[00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:54.297]  When I start really using my noggin, I start sweating.
[00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.541]  I can sit out in the sun if I'm not thinking.
[00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:00.806]  It can be 105 degrees and I barely sweat.
[00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:03.392]  When I really start trying to...
[00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:14.572]  Look at all the information on how serious it is to start sweating, which is a normal reaction if your child, say, is going to have surgery, or if you're being pushed to the edge of a cliff.
[00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:25.499]  And a lot of people try to stay away from facing things, and that's one reason we live in this very, very dangerous society and culture with a bunch of delusional devil worshippers running around thinking they're God.
[00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:32.150]  But as everybody can notice, I'm not obsessed with being right every time.
[00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:34.132]  I don't want to be right about this stuff.
[00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:36.955]  The word is Trump was going to declare an emergency two days ago.
[00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:40.279]  Evidence shows we're already in one.
[00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.941]  But he didn't do it.
[00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:45.784]  And now I see in hindsight he wanted to look measured.
[00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:52.079]  And nice, and have them overreact, thinking the emergency was coming, saying, don't air it, and acting all crazy.
[00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:59.180]  Trump, again, at least when it comes to things like that, has a very good instinct.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.761]  But now you hear he's saying, you don't do the deal, and you don't build the wall.
[00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:09.782]  And then they attack the idea of a wall, it's like they attack the idea of a border at all.
[00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:14.883]  You notice now that Trump is saying that he's set to declare an emergency.
[00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.161]  I don't think he's made the decision when to officially do it.
[00:02:20.122 --> 00:02:21.923]  That's why it's really hard to tell.
[00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:30.330]  But I really think at the border today, he's going to introduce the idea and really sell it to the public.
[00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:38.056]  And he'll either declare it today or he will declare it, I'd say, next Monday, next Tuesday, next Wednesday, maybe even as early as Friday, Owen.
[00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:39.097]  What do you think?
[00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:43.108]  I think it's going to be a little more of an extended timetable.
[00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:48.350]  I expect it maybe to come in two weeks, but I do think it's inevitable that there will be a national emergency declared.
[00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:57.274]  I think Trump has already decided that and I think he's just kind of measuring the waters and waiting for the right time to go ahead and go full throttle with it.
[00:02:57.814 --> 00:03:00.575]  And the Democrats, you know, and the amazing thing, Alex, is
[00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:15.207]  To us, we see the Democrats destroying themselves, and they are, but they have their ace in the hole and an entire game plan behind the socialist Sandy Cortez, which is really kind of their safety net here.
[00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.608]  Sure, that shows their timetable.
[00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:22.249]  Is to make it a racial socialist Hispanic party that then bullies all the other Hispanics to go along with it.
[00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:26.371]  And then they'll have that key demographic locked in vote and take us away of Venezuela.
[00:03:26.571 --> 00:03:30.672]  Which is the admitted globalist plan in the next 10 to 20 years.
[00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:32.592]  She's the prototype of the future.
[00:03:32.652 --> 00:03:36.553]  Total puppet being loaded information by the globalists that's set offshore.
[00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.074]  And I agree with you.
[00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:39.274]  And let's explain.
[00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:40.594]  People go, well, the Democrats are losers.
[00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:41.855]  They're inverting reality.
[00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:43.135]  They're horrible demon people.
[00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:44.415]  They want to sexualize our children.
[00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:46.056]  Yes, they're a weapon system.
[00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:48.057]  They're a demoralization bomb.
[00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:56.323]  And the reason they're a bunch of scum and physically look so ugly and hunchbacked and demonic is because this is the scum of the earth.
[00:03:56.964 --> 00:04:02.828]  Whether they be black, whether they be white, whatever group they are, these are literal wicked witch demons.
[00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.109]  And they know it.
[00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.170]  And they don't like being called out for it.
[00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.432]  These people are devil worshippers.
[00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:11.135]  And when you get to the bottom of the barrel in Hollywood, that's what they are.
[00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:11.855]  They're devil worshippers.
[00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:15.138]  And that's what these power seekers are devil worshippers.
[00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:22.270]  And they're all about themselves, and they're all about this me-me-me-me selfishness that's destroying civilization and society.
[00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.774]  These people are cancer.
[00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:25.895]  Alex, it's funny you said that.
[00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:34.741]  We didn't discuss this before the show, but that was my big thing today, is how the left is cancer to America, and if it's not cut out and ended, America will be dead.
[00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:41.105]  And I'm really in a bad mood today, I guess you could say, because I've realized it more than ever.
[00:04:41.645 --> 00:04:44.807]  Trump has to do everything or this country is dead.
[00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:45.528]  Well, that's right.
[00:04:45.548 --> 00:04:48.369]  And we keep, even ourselves, getting mad at him, like dad's supposed to do it all.
[00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.212]  And then we realize... We have to be there too, but... Well, that's why I feel physically ill right now.
[00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:55.416]  Because you can cut the tension.
[00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:58.283]  They're so afraid of him declaring an emergency and really going after him.
[00:04:58.744 --> 00:05:01.249]  And he's really thinking about doing it, so that's why the tension's so high.
[00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.231]  Defeat the globalists.
[00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:06.912]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.554]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[00:05:08.994 --> 00:05:10.095]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:15.280]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.144]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:27.792]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:28.713 --> 00:05:31.134]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:38.097]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:42.679]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:48.642]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:51.523]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:52.964]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:56.265]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:10.736]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:06:10.756 --> 00:06:19.322]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:19.342 --> 00:06:20.883]  The day of doom is here.
[00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:25.205]  At least that's the headline at DrugsReport.com.
[00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:27.947]  Shutdown doomsday scenario.
[00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:29.829]  We're going to be going over all of that.
[00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.994]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us for an hour, starting at the bottom of this hour.
[00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:45.743]  And of course, Owen Schroer is going to be hosting the broadcast today because I have the conference room packed with crew.
[00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.351]  On getting a bunch of key initiatives and things we're launching done.
[00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:55.773]  So that is why I am here in the office today, but not on air.
[00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:57.093]  And it is a momentous day.
[00:06:58.134 --> 00:07:00.055]  Trump is going down to the border.
[00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:10.099]  I know that he's already declared an emergency to the military a few months ago, and that he's set, at least in his thinking, to declare an emergency.
[00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:18.346]  He's having to remove people that says he doesn't have the power to do that when he 100% under the Constitution for a border and for an invasion.
[00:07:19.568 --> 00:07:20.629]  It's his right and his duty.
[00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.212]  I mean, this is not like some special wonderful thing he's doing.
[00:07:24.232 --> 00:07:25.894]  It's just in a sea of traitors and globalists.
[00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:30.898]  They try to upside down world and have us live in that fantasy land.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.802]  But the headlines up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:37.939]  Our Truly, tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:41.302]  This is where you've heard in the last year and a half about we need an emergency.
[00:07:41.422 --> 00:07:45.526]  Obama put an emergency in place, relatively speaking, two years ago.
[00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:48.308]  Even since he was president-elect, we've been saying that.
[00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:50.070]  And Zero Hedge has been saying that.
[00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.811]  And that's it.
[00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:54.949]  Zero Hedge has been putting up the legislation, the documents, the laws.
[00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.311]  We've been doing that as well.
[00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.412]  I feel good knowing Zero Hedge is there.
[00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:05.137]  I have no affiliation with Zero Hedge, but that's... Some leftist leaning stuff in there.
[00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:06.138]  I don't care about that.
[00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:17.208]  They talk about how the government works, the COG, the universities on top, the CIA, how the whole program works, how Operation Mockingbird is being carried out in a modern operation.
[00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:26.490]  So the reason I obsess over the fact that we're tomorrow's news today, next year's news today, is because the globalists are fighting around the clock to try to get us off the air.
[00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.792]  Because what we're seeing is the blueprint and how it works.
[00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:36.133]  And it's further along in some aspects than I thought.
[00:08:39.056 --> 00:08:42.357]  Just coming to grips with the true, pure evil.
[00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:48.178]  Just wanting to destroy life and kill children and hurt innocent people and just rip innocents into pieces.
[00:08:48.658 --> 00:09:01.240]  Just coming up against that spirit and having that realization of that fallen thing that we're up against just makes me get on my knees to God and ask for a great awakening and a new renaissance on this planet because it's what we need.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.320]  So Owen's going to take over in the next segment.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.641]  It's up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:06.861]  Trump heads the border.
[00:09:08.553 --> 00:09:09.894]  Emergency declaration.
[00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:11.435]  Test Republicans.
[00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:13.657]  Texas landowners prepare.
[00:09:14.318 --> 00:09:14.878]  Wall fight.
[00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:18.281]  Things Dems have funded that cost more.
[00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.424]  Drudge has a lot of key articles up there that break all that down.
[00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:26.628]  And then of course, we also have Armstrong Williams, which is true.
[00:09:26.948 --> 00:09:28.710]  Spiritual illness crippling America.
[00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.751]  This is a curse.
[00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:31.969]  And that's exactly what it is.
[00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:42.475]  You have the patriarch of the Orthodox Church coming out and saying that cell phones are the devices that mesmerize you and tie you into the Antichrist computer brain.
[00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:44.236]  And that's what it is.
[00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:49.979]  And so you hear Elon Musk saying it, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church saying it, Armstrong Williams saying it.
[00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:51.600]  That's what this is.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.520]  This is a curse.
[00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:55.864]  Real evil is being poured out in the world today.
[00:09:56.144 --> 00:10:06.572]  And I made some phone calls where I was even on air today to a few people just to let them know that, you know, some of the evil people that they've been exposing, they don't know how evil they are.
[00:10:07.853 --> 00:10:15.799]  And it's painful to know all this, but it's more painful if we deny it.
[00:10:17.381 --> 00:10:20.823]  It's more painful if we do not resist it.
[00:10:21.824 --> 00:10:26.146]  And the children don't know, and so they're being snared at a very young age.
[00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:27.546]  That's what these monsters do.
[00:10:28.526 --> 00:10:30.047]  They target them when they can't fight back.
[00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:32.748]  And so, I want to say this before I get into Trump and the emergency.
[00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:45.993]  Everything, everything that they do is about covertness,
[00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:48.704]  And incrementalism.
[00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:49.925]  Everything.
[00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:51.827]  It's the same blueprint and then they even admit it.
[00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:52.788]  It's not even our opinion.
[00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:54.890]  The hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.514]  The weaponized, electrified, acid-based fluoride.
[00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:02.757]  The GMO.
[00:11:03.318 --> 00:11:04.699]  The electromagnetic manipulation.
[00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:07.642]  They admit gives you cancer and tell you the newspaper is going to kill you.
[00:11:08.062 --> 00:11:09.964]  Is going to scramble your DNA and mutate you.
[00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:12.487]  This is all a giant
[00:11:13.737 --> 00:11:27.759]  Desecration of God's planet and of our genetics and our family lines, our seed, our genetics is literally being mutated into an ugly demonic form because that's what Satan seeks to do to God's creation.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.680]  And so people have to understand, everything is a soft kill, covert op.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:41.702]  All these people that pose like self-help and all the modern Timothy Leary types who are out there know full well what they're doing.
[00:11:42.855 --> 00:11:51.357]  And the vaccine pushing and the GMO and the cultural attack and the American Psychological Association saying...
[00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:56.500]  Men existing is bad and is a disease?
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.981]  No, they are the disease.
[00:11:58.622 --> 00:12:02.425]  Aliens, if they showed up and had collaborators, would be making announcements.
[00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:03.365]  Your families are bad.
[00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:04.346]  Your men are bad.
[00:12:04.686 --> 00:12:05.627]  Get rid of your boys.
[00:12:05.707 --> 00:12:06.528]  Put them in dresses.
[00:12:06.568 --> 00:12:07.308]  Give them chemicals.
[00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:11.071]  I mean, this is a science fiction movie for real, folks.
[00:12:11.472 --> 00:12:13.473]  The devil is a damn alien, okay?
[00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.235]  The Bible tells you the whole thing.
[00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:16.576]  It's going on.
[00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:17.877]  It's in it from another dimension.
[00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:20.198]  You can't see it, but it's all there, all around us.
[00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:23.020]  And it wants to kill you and your family.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.620]  Period.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:41.564]  And this evil force in the universe is telling all these people, like William Shatner, and Joe Rogan, and all these other people, join us and you will get eternal life, you will get advanced technology, you'll be uploaded, we're going to go through this great cleansing of the earth, and then you're going to be on the other side of it.
[00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:42.304]  They all know it.
[00:12:43.044 --> 00:12:49.566]  And then they pose like little kind of happy, trendy people, let's use this as an example, to make everybody not understand that they're predators.
[00:12:50.632 --> 00:12:52.132]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:53.973]  Luring people into the drug culture.
[00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.194]  Luring people into the so-called New Age.
[00:12:56.774 --> 00:12:58.234]  Luring people into this whole thing.
[00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:05.156]  And it's all meant to get you like walking out in front of a Mack truck you don't see and you never know what hits you.
[00:13:06.097 --> 00:13:08.057]  And so, and of course, these people are all slaves too.
[00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:10.178]  I'm not even singling them out to say they're bad.
[00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:10.878]  It's just that
[00:13:12.037 --> 00:13:21.160]  I realize people I've known a long time, because I'm such a loyal person, because I know them, I decide to be blind and be delusional, even though there's evil sitting right there.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.361]  And so it's good to see people pick sides.
[00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:34.784]  To be banned and attacked and persecuted and betrayed by these people is good, because we're forcing their hand to come out in the open and show us who they are.
[00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:39.906]  We're forcing these rats, these roaches, to come out from underneath their rocks and face us.
[00:13:40.828 --> 00:13:41.808]  And that's what they can't stand.
[00:13:41.828 --> 00:13:45.889]  It's come out Facebook is a total brainwashing cult.
[00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.590]  It's all MKUltra stuff.
[00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:52.811]  The universities, the psychology departments are their own cults.
[00:13:54.072 --> 00:14:04.635]  They're all pushing psychotropics and ayahuasca and DMT and then all these new synthetic super drugs coming out are being tested inside the universities everywhere.
[00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:07.656]  MKUltra is on your television.
[00:14:07.776 --> 00:14:09.717]  MKUltra is on your smartphone.
[00:14:09.777 --> 00:14:10.917]  MKUltra is in your school.
[00:14:12.058 --> 00:14:13.198]  MKUltra is in your water.
[00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:18.219]  It's even on CNBC that Facebook is a cult.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.020]  You understand?
[00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:28.642]  And so, they want to put you into the sensory deprivation tank of the internet.
[00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:38.959]  And they don't want us jacking into it, coming in and saying, look, we're not offering you some wonderland of the matrix, but it's what will make you strong and it's the real place.
[00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:41.579]  And I genuinely care about you.
[00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:42.699]  We're in this together.
[00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:44.559]  I've had four children.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.100]  The Globals don't have children because they're selfish on average, because they don't want to bet on the future.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.401]  They don't want to carry out that biological function that takes them closer to God.
[00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:57.282]  And they've all signed on to death.
[00:14:57.342 --> 00:14:58.402]  They're not going to get eternal life.
[00:14:58.422 --> 00:14:59.262]  They're going to get eternal death.
[00:15:00.998 --> 00:15:01.338]  Understand?
[00:15:01.838 --> 00:15:02.899]  Because they are death.
[00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:03.760]  They are destruction.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.660]  They are slavery.
[00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:07.862]  Our country is under total attack.
[00:15:08.042 --> 00:15:09.003]  Europe is under total attack.
[00:15:09.023 --> 00:15:19.429]  But the good news is, Italy's president and vice president, prime minister, have come out and said there is an axis of evil in Germany.
[00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.052]  And France, allied against the rest of Europe and the world.
[00:15:23.492 --> 00:15:25.494]  It was set up by the Nazis.
[00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:27.215]  It's World War Two, Part Two.
[00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:28.756]  Two plus two equals four.
[00:15:28.796 --> 00:15:29.417]  World War Four.
[00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:34.601]  They're taking over it with economic warfare and anti-culture warfare and anti-family warfare.
[00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:40.245]  And now it's spreading and they're saying we must create an axis worldwide to defeat this new system.
[00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:44.268]  So now all these presidents are sounding just like Infowars, not because they're even listening.
[00:15:44.288 --> 00:15:44.789]  Of course they are.
[00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:46.030]  It's because it's true.
[00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.812]  So our chain reaction is now launching.
[00:15:49.212 --> 00:15:51.554]  The resistance is now going into its main phase.
[00:15:51.774 --> 00:15:55.117]  The enemy can feel it and is going to put their full weight against us right now.
[00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:59.020]  Pray for Trump and ask God and Jesus Spirit to enter the planet.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.181]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:01.342]  Stay with us.
[00:16:06.946 --> 00:16:12.611]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years
[00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:18.911]  Demonizing Info Wars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:38.579]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming, I'm a fraud in selling snake oil, when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[00:16:40.228 --> 00:16:42.269]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:43.510]  Whole Foods was number two.
[00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.733]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[00:16:51.274 --> 00:16:57.478]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:12.484]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at InfoWarsLife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[00:17:13.405 --> 00:17:15.506]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[00:17:16.407 --> 00:17:19.308]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:20.089]  No response.
[00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.769]  They never want to get my comment.
[00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.690]  Now, why am I saying that?
[00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:24.391]  It's simple.
[00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:29.984]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:35.669]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[00:17:36.309 --> 00:17:37.550]  So we have a great product.
[00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.071]  You love it.
[00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:38.771]  You reorder it.
[00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:41.413]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[00:17:41.873 --> 00:17:43.795]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:44.996]  It's a 360 win.
[00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:46.037]  We defeat them.
[00:17:46.117 --> 00:17:46.497]  You win.
[00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:46.957]  I win.
[00:17:47.257 --> 00:17:47.758]  It's amazing.
[00:17:49.614 --> 00:17:54.396]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:54.436 --> 00:18:10.022]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[00:18:11.973 --> 00:18:12.473]  It's hard to believe.
[00:18:12.553 --> 00:18:15.294]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[00:18:15.374 --> 00:18:22.855]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:25.956]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[00:18:25.976 --> 00:18:35.478]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[00:18:35.578 --> 00:18:36.278]  But just know this.
[00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:46.436]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[00:18:46.756 --> 00:18:48.977]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[00:18:49.717 --> 00:19:00.063]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[00:19:00.843 --> 00:19:01.944]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[00:19:02.044 --> 00:19:02.705]  I'm garbage.
[00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:05.366]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:06.867]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:09.421]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:11.145]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[00:19:11.926 --> 00:19:13.570]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[00:19:14.712 --> 00:19:16.396]  Super metal Vitality, they have similar products.
[00:19:16.476 --> 00:19:17.178]  It's all dynamite.
[00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:22.597]  They can tell you how great it is and show you all the facts and tell you, because they're the elite.
[00:19:22.937 --> 00:19:25.198]  I'm just scum, just like you, according to them.
[00:19:25.238 --> 00:19:27.660]  But the good news is you've seen how great these products work.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.182]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:37.765]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience super male vitality, super female vitality.
[00:19:37.945 --> 00:19:48.070]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, super male vitality, super female, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.551]  Because it's so frustrating.
[00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:52.753]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[00:19:52.913 --> 00:19:57.776]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullworthstore.com and mfullworthslife.com.
[00:19:57.956 --> 00:19:58.797]  Thanks for your support.
[00:20:06.642 --> 00:20:09.283]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:22.542]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Schroer.
[00:20:22.562 --> 00:20:25.943]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.943 --> 00:20:29.964]  That's right, I'm filling in for Alex today.
[00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:31.965]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us.
[00:20:32.225 --> 00:20:34.265]  Simon Roche is going to be joining us.
[00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:35.846]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be joining us.
[00:20:35.866 --> 00:20:37.646]  Doug Hagman in the fourth hour.
[00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:39.907]  Tons of news to get to.
[00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:45.168]  And I was going to
[00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:47.650]  Come on today.
[00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:54.495]  And the focus was going to be how the left is a cancer to America that will kill us unless we cut it out.
[00:20:56.856 --> 00:21:09.986]  And I was going to talk about how I've fully identified the blueprint and the schematic that is behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, real name Sandy, or at least that's what they called her before she ran for office.
[00:21:10.166 --> 00:21:10.947]  But that's too white.
[00:21:11.087 --> 00:21:12.448]  So they went back to Alexandria.
[00:21:14.804 --> 00:21:19.588]  And then, Alex went next level in the last segment.
[00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:23.312]  And I was actually going to do that in the War Room today, and maybe I still will.
[00:21:27.015 --> 00:21:32.901]  And I've got a guest coming on the War Room tomorrow that can break this down, but this is actually something quite ancient.
[00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:37.425]  And you can even read about this in the Bible, like Alex was talking about.
[00:21:40.629 --> 00:21:44.830]  And I don't even know, you know, I'm 29 years old.
[00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:52.932]  I have not experienced everything there is to experience on this earth, but I've experienced a lot for a 29 year old, but I'm definitely not the leading expert on this.
[00:21:55.092 --> 00:22:02.334]  But we are in a multi-dimensional existence.
[00:22:03.714 --> 00:22:06.775]  Anybody who's seen it and experienced it knows it's true.
[00:22:07.235 --> 00:22:08.055]  This is in the Bible.
[00:22:09.976 --> 00:22:10.096]  And
[00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:17.526]  Famous philosophers and other people have talked about this, most recently Alan Watt is one.
[00:22:21.747 --> 00:22:39.354]  But in the Bible it talks about people having visions, seeing things from higher dimensions, and people that are experts in these fields talk about how you can skip, it's like a cheat code,
[00:22:40.256 --> 00:22:50.500]  Like, let's use the video game analogy of Mario, where you can skip entire levels and go into a warp zone.
[00:22:52.341 --> 00:22:58.704]  And so the experts say that's what you do when you take the DMT or you do the ayahuasca.
[00:22:59.944 --> 00:23:08.488]  And the shamans of this will warn you, this is not something for recreation, this is not something you do for fun, this is a serious
[00:23:11.511 --> 00:23:12.952]  experience that you're about to have.
[00:23:13.012 --> 00:23:14.514]  It's going to change your very existence.
[00:23:14.534 --> 00:23:16.856]  It's going to change everything that you perceive.
[00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:19.238]  It's going to change the way that you see things.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:32.249]  And so, they warn all of this to you before you do it, but there's this new cult and it's, it's, you know, and now they say, you know, they have the whole microdosing thing.
[00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.734]  That's really just a distraction for all the designer drugs that the elites in Silicon Valley are on.
[00:23:39.048 --> 00:23:42.271]  Which, who knows if we'll ever even know what that crap is.
[00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:49.957]  I mean, why do Tim Cook's eyes look like dinner plates and he's all fired up doing an interview with glasses from Vice?
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.604]  But it's funny because there was a story today, I believe it was on Drudge, about a poker player.
[00:23:59.155 --> 00:24:09.024]  Who bet $100,000 he could sit in sensory deprivation for 30 days, and by week two he started hallucinating and seeing things.
[00:24:12.067 --> 00:24:24.578]  I don't even know if I can... Devil worshipping cults have been in America for hundreds of years.
[00:24:25.598 --> 00:24:30.559]  In fact, it even was existent in Native American culture.
[00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:31.580]  This is all historical.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.121]  It came out of the Illuminati of Germany.
[00:24:37.001 --> 00:24:40.742]  And so these were like people that were seeking lower dimensions.
[00:24:40.982 --> 00:24:45.864]  People that were seeking power from lower dimensions because it's the lower dimensions
[00:24:46.857 --> 00:24:50.159]  That actually will wield power or attempt to wield power here in the third dimension.
[00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:58.263]  Angels and spirits and saints and everything from higher dimensions and of course God doesn't really wield that power.
[00:24:58.343 --> 00:25:00.344]  God is just... He just created everything.
[00:25:00.364 --> 00:25:02.445]  He has... He's already decided everything.
[00:25:04.306 --> 00:25:05.147]  But you can go back.
[00:25:05.187 --> 00:25:06.327]  This is all ancient.
[00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:14.472]  And so they have these group hallucination experiences
[00:25:16.055 --> 00:25:25.024]  Where they take ancient rituals, and they summon Lucifer from the second dimension.
[00:25:26.706 --> 00:25:35.354]  Now I know this sounds crazy, and to people who haven't looked into this or experienced it for themselves, you probably can't even comprehend what I'm talking about.
[00:25:37.016 --> 00:25:37.897]  It literally happens.
[00:25:41.792 --> 00:25:46.276]  And they summon Lucifer, and they communicate with Lucifer, and they take orders from Lucifer.
[00:25:47.577 --> 00:26:04.893]  And it's such a powerful thing, and it's so real to them in that time, you cannot help but fall to its just extraordinary existence.
[00:26:06.772 --> 00:26:14.858]  And so this is what all these occults and cults and secret societies, if you date back, I mean, hundreds of years, this is all documented, folks.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.222]  But see, that's the cheat code.
[00:26:21.303 --> 00:26:29.910]  That's how evil attempts to manifest itself in our divine ability
[00:26:32.438 --> 00:26:37.779]  To reach into the upper and lower dimensions while not actually existing in them.
[00:26:39.439 --> 00:26:53.802]  Now, if you go back and you read the Bible, you can go to Revelations, you can go to, in fact, there's a bunch of different chapters in the Bible that talk about people having hallucinations, in the desert, in this, seeing angels and all spirits and everything.
[00:26:55.502 --> 00:27:01.483]  You actually have the ability, and this, in modern day practice,
[00:27:03.248 --> 00:27:15.271]  I guess you would point to, you know, Buddhists and Taoists and people that do long-term meditation to reach higher spirituality, to reach higher consciousness, and to see higher dimensions.
[00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:18.071]  And you can do this!
[00:27:18.651 --> 00:27:22.192]  Your body naturally produces DMT.
[00:27:25.653 --> 00:27:30.714]  So when these cults take DMT in a
[00:27:32.148 --> 00:27:48.633]  ritualistic way to summon and see lucifer that's like cheating it's like using steroids to enhance your spirituality it's like using steroids to enhance your consciousness you can actually
[00:27:50.497 --> 00:27:55.579]  See different dimensions without having a drug-induced experience.
[00:27:55.959 --> 00:28:00.260]  That's the hallucinations that you experience when you're in sensory deprivation tanks.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:08.162]  That's what you read about in the Bible when these people have visions of the horses and everything in Revelations and everything in between.
[00:28:08.722 --> 00:28:10.723]  And this is all ancient!
[00:28:11.403 --> 00:28:13.564]  This is all ancient.
[00:28:13.644 --> 00:28:18.306]  In fact, this is in the even founding of America, folks.
[00:28:18.566 --> 00:28:36.673]  I mean, if you really want to get into it, just look at Washington D.C., look at the Washington Obelisk, look at ancient text with Isis and Osiris, and look at the pentagram, and look at all that, and you will find out what is really behind all of it.
[00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:49.274]  Cult secret societies that have been channeling lower dimensions and channeling Lucifer for power over the third dimension.
[00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:52.037]  And they have to make deals with Lucifer for this to happen.
[00:28:52.297 --> 00:29:01.526]  And now you understand why we're living in the modern day Sodom and Gomorrah and why it's a national emergency to cleanse ourselves spiritually before the devil kills us all.
[00:29:02.886 --> 00:29:07.389]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:14.273]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:24.179]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:25.860]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.722]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[00:29:29.302 --> 00:29:41.751]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes.
[00:29:41.851 --> 00:29:45.573]  Everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[00:29:45.633 --> 00:29:54.560]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[00:29:55.416 --> 00:30:15.333]  But now they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[00:30:16.094 --> 00:30:18.336]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[00:30:19.316 --> 00:30:22.999]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[00:30:23.019 --> 00:30:23.679]  They're patriots.
[00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:35.387]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[00:30:35.947 --> 00:30:36.787]  You drop ship it.
[00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:37.508]  You get it out.
[00:30:37.688 --> 00:30:38.589]  You have the website.
[00:30:39.189 --> 00:30:39.809]  I promote it.
[00:30:39.989 --> 00:30:40.870]  I send people there.
[00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:44.092]  And that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:48.215]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[00:30:49.352 --> 00:30:58.980]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:04.485]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[00:31:04.766 --> 00:31:12.853]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[00:31:14.059 --> 00:31:24.189]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.292]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[00:31:26.332 --> 00:31:26.912]  I've researched it.
[00:31:26.932 --> 00:31:32.398]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[00:31:32.418 --> 00:31:33.839]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:46.578]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[00:31:47.862 --> 00:31:55.726]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[00:31:56.406 --> 00:32:12.634]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[00:32:12.975 --> 00:32:15.756]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:16.957]  They've tried to shut us down.
[00:32:17.737 --> 00:32:18.937]  They've tried to boycott us.
[00:32:18.957 --> 00:32:19.758]  They've tried to sue us.
[00:32:20.258 --> 00:32:26.740]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:34.743]  We're still going to do that with Infowarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[00:32:34.823 --> 00:32:36.644]  And this is the first big one.
[00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:37.885]  So I'm very excited.
[00:32:37.905 --> 00:32:38.685]  Be sure and go there.
[00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:46.368]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the highest quality,
[00:32:46.988 --> 00:32:47.909]  The lowest prices.
[00:32:48.349 --> 00:32:54.135]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the InfoWar the whole time.
[00:33:06.627 --> 00:33:09.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.653 --> 00:33:30.222]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.683 --> 00:33:34.488]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:37.037 --> 00:33:40.559]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday edition.
[00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:56.345]  I'll be taking over for the next hour with probably one of the biggest stories of what should at least be one of the biggest stories of the year so far, which has received no mainstream media attention whatsoever.
[00:33:56.825 --> 00:33:59.266]  In fact, I just checked it as of the past hour.
[00:33:59.606 --> 00:34:02.007]  There's one RT article about this.
[00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:05.349]  Apart from that, you'll only find it on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.033 --> 00:34:07.194]  And what is that story?
[00:34:07.234 --> 00:34:31.296]  Well, just to give a bit of backstory, because back in November, you'll probably remember the confrontation between CNN anchor, CNN reporter Jim Acosta and President Trump during that press conference in the White House, where again, Acosta tried to make himself the center of attention by staying on the mic, by asking question after question and making statement after statement after statement.
[00:34:31.863 --> 00:34:36.025]  Being an activist, not a journalist, of course there was a massive controversy over that.
[00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:45.531]  Because when the White House staffer tried to grab the microphone from Acosta, he accosted her by shoving her arm down and shoving her away.
[00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:47.912]  Everybody saw that on the video.
[00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:50.994]  That was becoming a bit of a problem for the mainstream media.
[00:34:52.057 --> 00:35:05.742]  So they crafted this giant narrative around how InfoWars, and yours truly, adopted the video of Jim Acosta's confrontation with that female White House staffer to make it look worse than it was.
[00:35:06.542 --> 00:35:12.544]  They couldn't really decide whether I'd sped up the video or slowed it down, couldn't really make their minds up, they said both.
[00:35:13.805 --> 00:35:20.707]  Jimmy Kimmel and a bunch of late-night comedy hosts got up there the next night and said that, oh, he's removed the audio!
[00:35:21.508 --> 00:35:22.689]  No, I didn't remove the audio.
[00:35:22.769 --> 00:35:25.132]  There was no audio because it was a GIF image.
[00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:27.454]  GIF images do not have audio.
[00:35:28.175 --> 00:35:31.338]  So there was this media narrative for about...
[00:35:32.273 --> 00:35:33.854]  Three days, if not more.
[00:35:33.874 --> 00:35:49.603]  It probably went on for most of the week, actually, now that I recall, that we had deliberately doctored the video of this confrontation to deceive the American people, and then the White House had then tweeted out that video for the same purpose, to deceive the American people.
[00:35:49.643 --> 00:36:01.049]  Because if you look at the definition of doctored as it relates to video footage, it means you deliberately have to change and amend that footage with the intention of deceiving the viewer.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.181]  So it can't be accidental.
[00:36:04.002 --> 00:36:05.523]  It can't be incidental.
[00:36:05.623 --> 00:36:10.828]  It has to be deliberate, deliberately done in an attempt to deceive, to mislead the viewer.
[00:36:11.448 --> 00:36:19.415]  Now, of course, as I've proven, which, you know, after the fact I made two videos on this, I did not deliberately doctor any footage.
[00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:24.740]  I made that plain with evidence pointing out that, yes, it may have lost a couple of frames,
[00:36:25.834 --> 00:36:29.537]  In the compression from a video to a GIF file and then back to a video again.
[00:36:29.877 --> 00:36:32.179]  But there was no deliberate doctoring of that footage.
[00:36:32.639 --> 00:36:39.805]  They crafted that entire narrative to distract from Acosta's bad behavior in accosting that woman.
[00:36:40.305 --> 00:36:44.868]  So that was the media narrative for about four or five days that week in November.
[00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:48.291]  They made such a massive deal out of it.
[00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:50.733]  And then look what we have today.
[00:36:51.113 --> 00:36:53.435]  And look how big of a deal has been made out of this.
[00:36:54.269 --> 00:37:11.616]  We have a Liberal staffer working for a Seattle news station, Q13 Fox, caught red-handed doctoring footage of President Trump as it was broadcast live to deliberately mislead the American people.
[00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:20.460]  This news network, and you see the footage here, Trump's talking, he's doing his address to the nation on the border situation on Tuesday night.
[00:37:21.232 --> 00:37:33.416]  He finishes his sentence and then whoever's in control of this Q13 Fox station uses what looks like deep fake technology where they take two images of a person and synthesize them.
[00:37:34.437 --> 00:37:48.262]  So again, they've basically cut out his mouth and made it look as if President Trump is sticking his tongue out and basically looking completely idiotic and not able to speak during a live White House address to the nation.
[00:37:49.332 --> 00:38:10.802]  Now this looks like deepfake technology, which the mainstream media has been alarmist and hysterical about for well over a year, claiming that Russia, that China, the other bad actors, the Trump supporters themselves, could use this technology to fake what public officials, what politicians are saying, to mislead the American public.
[00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.343]  Their main concern was around Russia.
[00:38:14.504 --> 00:38:18.366]  But now a left-wing anti-Trump activist, that's obviously who this is,
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:27.489]  Has done it in Seattle during a live address to the nation and no media at all in the United States is reporting on it.
[00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:33.116]  There's one RT article, I'll get to that after the InfoWars article which we put up this morning.
[00:38:34.177 --> 00:38:38.162]  Seattle news station caught doctoring Trump video to make president look stupid.
[00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:46.075]  It says the clip which was aired live on Tuesday night shows Trump finishing a sentence before appearing to stick out his tongue for an elongated amount of time.
[00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:49.238]  The video then cuts to a generic station ID screen.
[00:38:49.258 --> 00:38:51.339]  Again, this is Q13 Fox in Seattle.
[00:38:51.659 --> 00:38:58.525]  The intent of the video is clearly to make President Trump look ridiculous and you'll see that when you watch it and with the audio as well.
[00:38:59.285 --> 00:39:03.229]  Now there was a blog called My Northwest which first drew attention to this.
[00:39:03.329 --> 00:39:06.211]  Again, no mainstream media coverage, no corporate media coverage.
[00:39:07.401 --> 00:39:14.005]  So that comparison reveals the Q13 video created a loop of the President licking his lips making it seem bizarre and unbalanced.
[00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:19.408]  It also seems that someone distorted the President's face and may have added an orange tone to his skin.
[00:39:20.429 --> 00:39:31.535]  So they've either used deepfake technology to insert a fake mouth that looks like Trump sticking his tongue out for an elongated amount of time or they've just paused it and then done a loop.
[00:39:32.415 --> 00:39:44.663]  Because he does appear to stick his tongue out and then they've looped that and just replayed that section of the video where it's just his mouth to make sure that he looks dumb, he looks ridiculous sticking his tongue out again for an elongated amount of time.
[00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:50.386]  Now Q13 Fox responded to the controversy by basically admitting it.
[00:39:50.426 --> 00:39:57.330]  They released a statement saying the individual responsible for the stunt has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation.
[00:39:58.171 --> 00:40:01.413]  Their statement said, quote, we are investigating this to determine what happened
[00:40:02.054 --> 00:40:08.241]  This does not meet our editorial standards and we regret it as it's seen as portraying the President in a negative light.
[00:40:09.342 --> 00:40:10.844]  So they admit it makes him look stupid.
[00:40:11.084 --> 00:40:16.690]  The editor responsible for editing the footage is being placed on leave while we investigate further.
[00:40:17.491 --> 00:40:21.836]  Again, we saw this in France with the Yellow Vest protest, which I'm going to talk about later in the hour.
[00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:30.692]  Where they had somebody carrying an anti-President Macron sign, which basically meant Macron F off.
[00:40:30.772 --> 00:40:32.253]  That's what the sign meant in French.
[00:40:32.753 --> 00:40:35.513]  And they removed the cussing out of that sign.
[00:40:35.553 --> 00:40:36.934]  So the sign just said Macron.
[00:40:38.374 --> 00:40:45.195]  So again, you've got mainstream networks in France doctoring protest signs to protect their establishment.
[00:40:45.895 --> 00:40:49.996]  And now after the mainstream media repeatedly
[00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:56.454]  Made hysterical claims about Russia using deepfake technology to mislead the American people.
[00:40:56.834 --> 00:40:59.496]  An anti-Trump leftist does it in Seattle.
[00:41:00.597 --> 00:41:01.558]  And it's crickets!
[00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:12.027]  They made a story about altering video in relation to President Trump, the top story, or at least in the top three stories in America, for nearly a week.
[00:41:12.634 --> 00:41:17.418]  Back in November, they lied about me, they lied about InfoWars claiming we doctored it.
[00:41:17.758 --> 00:41:20.421]  That was a top story for about five days.
[00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:22.082]  This happens.
[00:41:22.883 --> 00:41:24.604]  Nobody's even talking about it!
[00:41:24.624 --> 00:41:28.527]  I expected them to at least have to mention this at this point.
[00:41:29.068 --> 00:41:31.930]  I just searched on Google News as of 20 minutes ago.
[00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:32.831]  Nothing.
[00:41:32.871 --> 00:41:34.112]  There's one RT article.
[00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:51.968]  And again, this is despite, back in September, three lawmakers, two Democrats, one Republican, sending a letter to the Director of National Intelligence warning AI deepfakes, quote, have the potential to disrupt every facet of our society.
[00:41:52.888 --> 00:41:53.989]  So they're warning about it.
[00:41:54.029 --> 00:41:58.913]  They're writing letters to the Director of National Intelligence, basically saying this is a national security threat.
[00:42:00.127 --> 00:42:03.050]  They claim it happened with Jim Acosta even though it didn't.
[00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.992]  They made it the top news story for about three or four days.
[00:42:07.052 --> 00:42:10.195]  That was one of the biggest stories in the country that month.
[00:42:11.576 --> 00:42:15.058]  This happens and obviously an anti-Trump liberal is behind it.
[00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:18.281]  Absolute lockdown on the story.
[00:42:18.701 --> 00:42:20.983]  The only news outlet apart from InfoWars
[00:42:22.302 --> 00:42:29.735]  And the blog that initially drew attention to it is RT, Deep Fakes in Action, Seattle TV station accused of doctoring Trump's speech video.
[00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:33.222]  And we're going to get into reading that story after the break.
[00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:34.477]  Living in Volcano
[00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:20.415]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:43:20.435 --> 00:43:21.818]  And I'm coming!
[00:43:21.958 --> 00:43:24.283]  Paul and Frank Stringini
[00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:31.456]  ...are a pair of brothers who have a YouTube channel featuring humorous animations and songs that are sometimes provocative and offensive.
[00:43:31.577 --> 00:43:33.859]  They are artists with a message to corporate censors.
[00:43:33.919 --> 00:43:35.321]  Censor us and we will destroy you.
[00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:40.146]  They're also creators of a real video game they made called Alex Jones vs. the NPCs.
[00:43:40.566 --> 00:43:43.149]  You can find the String Genie Bros.
[00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:46.012]  on YouTube, stringgeniebrothers.com.
[00:43:46.192 --> 00:43:51.653]  Creating art, creating literature, creating images, creating ideas is what the establishment's most scared of.
[00:43:51.673 --> 00:43:52.953]  So you guys are the cure.
[00:43:53.013 --> 00:43:55.434]  And what's on your mind here on Christmas Eve, my friends?
[00:43:55.594 --> 00:43:58.854]  Well, the thing that is most on our mind is freedom of speech.
[00:43:59.194 --> 00:44:03.195]  There are all these conglomerates, corporations that want to shut people down, like you.
[00:44:03.215 --> 00:44:09.456]  One of the reasons we were inspired to make the game was because of what they did to you and the way they distorted the truth.
[00:44:10.176 --> 00:44:13.537]  They're supposed to be the people who give us the truth.
[00:44:14.252 --> 00:44:16.293]  But they're spreading lies and misinformation.
[00:44:16.953 --> 00:44:20.554]  And part of what this game is supposed to portray, it's saying a lot of things.
[00:44:21.294 --> 00:44:27.897]  But we are not going to sit by while they take away our freedoms and they tell us what we're allowed to hear or listen to.
[00:44:28.357 --> 00:44:29.217]  We're explorers.
[00:44:29.257 --> 00:44:32.158]  We want to explore the world and know what's out there.
[00:44:32.638 --> 00:44:37.240]  And I'm not going to allow any corporation to tell me I can't hear something like Alex Jones.
[00:44:37.845 --> 00:44:40.147]  If I want to listen to Alex Jones, I'm going to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:44:40.308 --> 00:44:42.870]  The dangerous thing is that they don't realize the danger is.
[00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.734]  If they don't allow people to speak, what are people left with?
[00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:47.795]  What comes next?
[00:44:48.055 --> 00:44:49.397]  And so they can't be allowed to win.
[00:44:49.437 --> 00:44:52.740]  And that's why in this game, you can't lose because we're not allowed to lose.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.181]  We must win this fight.
[00:44:54.302 --> 00:44:57.625]  You can't kill Alex Jones in this game because we are going to win.
[00:44:57.825 --> 00:44:59.767]  There's no one in the studio right now.
[00:44:59.787 --> 00:45:01.128]  I don't know where they got this.
[00:45:02.009 --> 00:45:03.129]  Crazy tomahawk.
[00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.530]  Seriously, what are these doing around the office?
[00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.432]  But there's camera 5 about 30 feet away.
[00:45:10.192 --> 00:45:12.753]  The question is, can I hit camera 5?
[00:45:13.873 --> 00:45:14.633]  No framing.
[00:45:15.374 --> 00:45:18.054]  The problem is, I can definitely get it, but that light's in my way.
[00:45:18.254 --> 00:45:18.715]  That's alright.
[00:45:20.835 --> 00:45:21.575]  Hit the light.
[00:45:22.296 --> 00:45:23.976]  See, I told you the light was in the way.
[00:45:24.296 --> 00:45:25.697]  Hey, I get three chances.
[00:45:25.737 --> 00:45:27.037]  Bring the hatchet back, please.
[00:45:27.217 --> 00:45:29.918]  Let me see if I can get camera five now, because I was going to get it.
[00:45:30.498 --> 00:45:31.658]  It's a good 30 feet away.
[00:45:34.059 --> 00:45:35.440]  Hit the TV that time.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.860]  All right, we got to keep going here.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.641]  All right, this is the final shot.
[00:45:40.241 --> 00:45:41.541]  If I can't make it now, no good.
[00:45:44.767 --> 00:45:46.389]  Stuck in the wall, but I didn't get it.
[00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:47.931]  Actually, it was all 3D.
[00:45:47.951 --> 00:45:49.072]  None of it was real.
[00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:55.460]  He's not allowed to make new accounts anymore, and he is permanently kicked off the platform.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.481]  My heart's big!
[00:45:56.621 --> 00:45:58.764]  It's got hot blood going through it fast!

[00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:20.521]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.621 --> 00:47:27.266]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.706 --> 00:47:31.409]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:47:33.909 --> 00:47:40.212]  I'm absolutely flabbergasted about the complete silence, the complete media lockdown on this story.
[00:47:40.813 --> 00:47:42.093]  And I've just looked on Twitter.
[00:47:43.214 --> 00:47:49.337]  I tweeted out this InfoWars story this morning about this news station doctoring live footage of President Trump.
[00:47:51.438 --> 00:47:56.321]  7,000 likes, nearly 4,000 retweets, 200,000 impressions on this one tweet alone.
[00:47:57.161 --> 00:48:00.403]  And again, the story is, for over a year,
[00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:16.788]  The media has been scaremongering, calling it a national security crisis, about Russia potentially exploiting this deepfake technology, which again is when they splice together two video files of a person talking mainly.
[00:48:17.088 --> 00:48:19.430]  Also, obviously, they use it in the porn industry.
[00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:23.773]  In fact, there's now a company and the RT article talks about it.
[00:48:24.628 --> 00:48:35.497]  Where people can superimpose their friends or their lovers or their exes onto the faces of porn stars so they can watch people they know engaging in porn.
[00:48:35.797 --> 00:48:36.778]  That's a big story.
[00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:48.788]  It's a huge concern and it's a national security crisis that Russia could exploit deepfake technology to deceive the American people to make it look like public figures are saying something they're not.
[00:48:49.268 --> 00:48:51.250]  Of course, that is a drastic problem.
[00:48:52.455 --> 00:49:02.097]  In terms of, you know, there could be a massive nuclear confrontation and you could have world leaders appearing to say something live that they're not actually saying.
[00:49:02.577 --> 00:49:04.078]  I agree, that's a big concern.
[00:49:05.158 --> 00:49:13.280]  And it was a huge concern when I doctored some footage of Jim Acosta, even though I didn't doctor it, and they went on about it for days and days and days.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.121]  But when an anti-Trump leftist in Seattle does it,
[00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:25.213]  For a mainstream TV station during a live presidential Oval Office address, none of them even report on it!
[00:49:27.013 --> 00:49:30.875]  How can they get away with not even mentioning this story?
[00:49:31.275 --> 00:49:32.856]  This is absolutely huge.
[00:49:34.156 --> 00:49:35.317]  RT headline.
[00:49:35.817 --> 00:49:36.897]  Deep fakes in action.
[00:49:37.297 --> 00:49:42.799]  Seattle TV station accused, accused, they've admitted to it, of doctoring Trump's speech video.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:44.160]  And again,
[00:49:45.023 --> 00:49:49.586]  They talk about, in fact they've embedded my tweet in this article.
[00:49:49.626 --> 00:49:57.170]  It says, Faking video footage has become easy in recent years thanks to the widespread availability of video editing software.
[00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:07.035]  A combative press conference debate between CNN anchor Jim Acosta and President Trump in November put the issue in the spotlight after internet detectives
[00:50:07.737 --> 00:50:11.462]  Accused Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson of editing video footage of a Costa.
[00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:16.128]  Of course they had other experts come out and say that there was no editing or doctoring whatsoever.
[00:50:16.509 --> 00:50:19.613]  Again, editing, all video footage is edited.
[00:50:20.133 --> 00:50:21.996]  That's what they go after James O'Keeffe on.
[00:50:22.907 --> 00:50:28.192]  When he gets, like, three hours long of him talking to somebody, he edits it down for a YouTube video.
[00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:29.433]  Oh, it's edited!
[00:50:29.473 --> 00:50:30.133]  It's edited!
[00:50:30.173 --> 00:50:30.994]  You can't trust that.
[00:50:31.054 --> 00:50:31.595]  It's edited.
[00:50:32.055 --> 00:50:33.496]  All video footage is edited.
[00:50:33.796 --> 00:50:38.641]  We're talking about doctoring, where it's edited deliberately to deceive.
[00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:40.682]  Which, again, I did not do.
[00:50:40.722 --> 00:50:42.624]  I've proven all that in two separate YouTube videos.
[00:50:44.045 --> 00:50:47.949]  The RT article goes on to say the edited video was shared by the White House, which it was.
[00:50:48.269 --> 00:50:49.510]  Sarah Sanders tweeted it.
[00:50:50.262 --> 00:50:54.083]  Watson denied the accusation and eventually the debate was forgotten about.
[00:50:54.103 --> 00:51:03.184]  Yeah, after a week of wall-to-wall press coverage, now it happens in America during a live presidential address.
[00:51:03.704 --> 00:51:04.705]  Nobody's talking about it.
[00:51:04.745 --> 00:51:06.145]  This story was out yesterday.
[00:51:06.665 --> 00:51:18.847]  Nobody's talking about it, even though they've literally had congressmen, lawmakers write letters to the Director of National Security warning about this, warning that it could
[00:51:19.534 --> 00:51:23.737]  Deeply disrupt society, in their own words, AI election meddling.
[00:51:24.557 --> 00:51:28.459]  That's a big concern, but when it actually happens, it's admitted to, it's proven.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.340]  Nobody even cares.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:43.148]  Like, I'm not saying this is a national security threat, but it's a massive news story, especially if we're supposedly supposed to be really concerned about doctored video and AI deepfakes, and yet nobody is talking about it.
[00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:44.849]  Maybe they will be forced to cover it,
[00:51:45.874 --> 00:51:46.894]  Over the next few hours.
[00:51:47.234 --> 00:51:59.738]  But as of right now, when we're doing this broadcast, the only places you can read about this are RT, as of like an hour ago, the blog that initially drew attention to it yesterday, and InfoWars.com this morning.
[00:51:59.798 --> 00:52:02.359]  So absolutely incredible situation.
[00:52:02.879 --> 00:52:07.821]  And if there is an update on that, I'll revisit it before the end of my hour on the show.
[00:52:07.841 --> 00:52:11.842]  But again, absolutely flabbergasted that nobody's drawing attention to that.
[00:52:13.985 --> 00:52:16.928]  Now let's zoom out globally and talk about the Yellow Vest Movement.
[00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:22.655]  And I put up a YouTube video last night about basically the latest on the Yellow Vest Movement.
[00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:33.847]  The fact that now there's a small but growing Yellow Vest Movement in the UK and they're using stunts and media narratives to try and denigrate that group of people.
[00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:37.887]  Because God forbid they called a politician a Nazi.
[00:52:38.408 --> 00:52:44.090]  Here we are on the right, we've been called Nazis and fascists for years and years and years, nobody bats an eyelid.
[00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.351]  The media encourages it, they encourage violence against us.
[00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:59.377]  We saw the AFD politician a few days ago beaten to a bloody pulp again because Antifa thought, well he's a fascist, he's a Nazi, therefore we have the right to basically try to assassinate him.
[00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:04.379]  That is the ground that the media, that's the environment the media has whipped up over the past couple of years.
[00:53:05.162 --> 00:53:07.024]  Of course, intensified after Charlottesville.
[00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:13.970]  And yet, now in the UK, the Yellow Vest movement have been de-platformed on PayPal.
[00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:21.557]  Their Facebook accounts are being shut down because one of them had the temerity to call a Tory MP a Nazi.
[00:53:21.718 --> 00:53:24.620]  And I'll get into that in the video, which we'll play in the next segment.
[00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:25.821]  It's a seven-minute video.
[00:53:26.502 --> 00:53:29.185]  But the latest on the Yellow Vest is this, again out of RT.
[00:53:30.419 --> 00:53:37.160]  Officials' worst nightmare, Yellow Vests hope to trigger bank run with financial protest.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.421]  And this is slated to happen on Saturday.
[00:53:40.461 --> 00:53:45.262]  If it does, it will be absolutely monumental because this is not a small group of people.
[00:53:46.202 --> 00:53:52.163]  Yellow Vest protesters are hoping to trigger a bank run with a nationwide coordinated cash withdrawal.
[00:53:52.923 --> 00:53:58.864]  By threatening the French financial system, protesters say they want to peacefully force the government to pass their reforms.
[00:53:59.901 --> 00:54:06.744]  Now, because we had the footage on Saturday, they're claiming this Yellow Vest protest movement in France is diminishing.
[00:54:07.484 --> 00:54:10.445]  If it's diminishing in numbers, it's certainly not diminishing in violence.
[00:54:10.465 --> 00:54:23.891]  There have been claims and counterclaims that the actual violence is actually being carried out by the more left-wing communist individuals and the massive migrants from the suburbs there in Paris and other areas.
[00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:26.532]  Again, claims and counterclaims on that.
[00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:33.272]  But massive unrest in Paris, massive unrest in Lyon and numerous other French cities over the weekend.
[00:54:33.652 --> 00:54:36.092]  Cannes looked like a battlefield, not a city.
[00:54:37.033 --> 00:54:43.635]  But now the Yellow Vests are saying they're going to withdraw all their cash, or as much as possible, on Saturday.
[00:54:43.655 --> 00:54:48.796]  There's a quote here, if the banks weaken, the state weakens immediately.
[00:54:49.196 --> 00:54:52.397]  That's what Yellow Vest sympathiser Taz Psalm said on Facebook.
[00:54:52.877 --> 00:54:55.818]  It's elected officials' worst nightmare.
[00:54:56.522 --> 00:55:03.505]  Protesters plan to empty their bank accounts on Saturday, withdrawing as much money as possible in a bid to undermine the French banks, if not the euro itself.
[00:55:04.325 --> 00:55:15.330]  The plan is to scare the state legally and without violence, forcing the government to adopt the movement's Citizens Referendum Initiative, which would allow citizens to propose and vote on new laws.
[00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:20.512]  Bearing in mind that Macron's approval rating is now at 23% on last count, this was
[00:55:24.784 --> 00:55:29.427]  He was heralded as the saviour of globalism when he won the French election in 2017.
[00:55:30.648 --> 00:55:40.915]  Now he's got a 23% approval rating and French people in Paris are literally using forklift trucks to try to bulldoze their way into the city's government buildings.
[00:55:42.276 --> 00:55:44.678]  Globalism there in a wonderful state as we can see.
[00:55:45.198 --> 00:55:48.701]  But now they're talking about withdrawing all their cash.
[00:55:48.761 --> 00:55:50.622]  Bear in mind, polls show
[00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:58.524]  In France, 77% of the French public support the Yellow Vests movement, even after all the violence.
[00:55:58.584 --> 00:55:59.865]  And yes, we had some looting.
[00:56:00.465 --> 00:56:03.686]  Yes, we had some violence in terms of police officers being attacked.
[00:56:04.286 --> 00:56:08.208]  But again, the attacks coming from the police are just as sustained.
[00:56:08.248 --> 00:56:15.031]  We had the arrest of the Yellow Vest leader, or one of them at least, in Paris, Eric Drouet, back around a week ago.
[00:56:15.171 --> 00:56:19.453]  They snatched him basically while he was having a dinner with his friends in a restaurant.
[00:56:20.293 --> 00:56:24.494]  They're talking about introducing a law which would make it illegal to protest.
[00:56:24.934 --> 00:56:28.635]  So you would have to get permission from the government to protest the government.
[00:56:29.115 --> 00:56:30.895]  Now they're going to take it one step further.
[00:56:30.935 --> 00:56:40.777]  Whether there are enough of them to actually have any effect or to force the French state into placing temporary limits on cash withdrawals remains to be seen.
[00:56:41.657 --> 00:56:43.117]  We're going to get our bread back.
[00:56:43.637 --> 00:56:47.618]  You're making money with our dough and we're fed up, said protester Maxime Nicol.
[00:56:48.419 --> 00:57:03.502]  In a video message shared on YouTube, a well-coordinated financial action has the potential to bring the French banking system, and by extension, the Euro, to its knees, as banks always only hold a fraction of the funds of the country citizens have in their accounts.
[00:57:03.722 --> 00:57:05.782]  Fractional reserve banking, of course.
[00:57:06.442 --> 00:57:14.644]  Most banks limit ATM withdrawals to a relatively low amount, meaning processors would have to line up inside the banks to withdraw the rest of their money.
[00:57:15.396 --> 00:57:38.622]  Now, even if they could do that without triggering any kind of crisis, if there are not enough of them to trigger a crisis, the mere sight, the mere video footage, the mere optics of people lined up outside French banks demanding their money is going to be another public relations nightmare for President Macron and the French state, and of course, crucially, the European Union.
[00:57:39.162 --> 00:57:46.764]  So even if it has no direct knock-on effect to the economy, the optics of that are going to be dreadful for the globalists.
[00:57:47.164 --> 00:57:49.245]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:50.005 --> 00:57:51.646]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[00:57:51.846 --> 00:57:52.286]  We'll be back.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.221]  Let's go to Wildman in Illinois.
[00:58:01.241 --> 00:58:03.561]  Thanks for holding and about to say Happy New Year.
[00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:03.861]  Go ahead.
[00:58:04.181 --> 00:58:13.664]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[00:58:13.704 --> 00:58:14.865]  That's how he saves America.
[00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:18.646]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[00:58:18.906 --> 00:58:19.226]  I agree.
[00:58:19.306 --> 00:58:20.047]  Victory or death.
[00:58:20.107 --> 00:58:21.787]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[00:58:22.108 --> 00:58:23.608]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[00:58:23.628 --> 00:58:26.690]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.371]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:31.072]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[00:58:31.112 --> 00:58:31.672]  It's already begun.
[00:58:31.692 --> 00:58:33.773]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[00:58:34.253 --> 00:58:39.595]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[00:58:39.956 --> 00:58:40.576]  So just get ready.
[00:58:40.876 --> 00:58:41.336]  I'd say.
[00:58:41.396 --> 00:58:45.018]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[00:58:45.198 --> 00:58:47.680]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.880]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.161]  I want to thank you.
[00:58:50.341 --> 00:58:57.585]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[00:58:58.325 --> 00:58:59.765]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[00:59:00.265 --> 00:59:01.926]  They're taking everybody.
[00:59:01.966 --> 00:59:03.746]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[00:59:03.786 --> 00:59:06.887]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[00:59:06.947 --> 00:59:08.847]  That's why this is a war.
[00:59:09.388 --> 00:59:10.888]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[00:59:11.128 --> 00:59:12.428]  Which products do you like the best?
[00:59:12.568 --> 00:59:14.149]  Man, I use the bodies.
[00:59:14.249 --> 00:59:15.449]  I got so many t-shirts.
[00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:16.549]  It ain't even funny.
[00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:21.210]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[00:59:21.671 --> 00:59:25.231]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[00:59:25.531 --> 00:59:26.672]  I spread the word about you.
[00:59:26.852 --> 00:59:27.652]  I wear your clothes.
[00:59:28.052 --> 00:59:30.473]  Your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[00:59:30.593 --> 00:59:31.754]  Multitude of products.
[00:59:32.054 --> 00:59:35.715]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[00:59:35.735 --> 00:59:42.618]  Um, you know, it's uh, people skeptical, but like it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[00:59:42.678 --> 00:59:45.459]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[00:59:56.826 --> 01:00:08.816]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:10.318 --> 01:00:11.259]  You found it.
[01:00:11.579 --> 01:00:13.100]  The tip of the spear.
[01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:16.083]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.643 --> 01:00:20.587]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00:22.944 --> 01:00:32.148]  So we're going to play the latest on the Yellow Vest global movement in the next segment with that new video which went up on YouTube last night, but we're going to continue with European news right now.
[01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.409]  And again out of RT, this is huge.
[01:00:35.129 --> 01:00:41.532]  Italy Salvini suggests European spring to bring end to German-French axis on continent.
[01:00:42.066 --> 01:00:51.749]  So again, over the past few days, the populist government in Italy basically came out and directly advocated, encouraged, supported the yellow vest movement.
[01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.670]  France wasn't happy about that.
[01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:57.952]  They shot back and said you should basically clean up your own doorstep.
[01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:03.093]  Again, this is a government with a guy at the head of it with a 23% approval rating.
[01:01:03.574 --> 01:01:07.655]  So I think they should clean up their own doorstep before they cast aspersions on anyone else.
[01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:20.115]  But now Italy's Eurosceptic Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has said he wants Italy and Poland to join together to create a European spring which could end the long-standing French and German domination on the continent.
[01:01:20.495 --> 01:01:30.579]  Now because him using that rhetoric amidst the yellow vest movement is no coincidence because many people have referred to it as the European spring.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:54.297]  Speaking during a press conference with Polish Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski in Warsaw on Wednesday, Salvini said that Poland and Italy, quote, listen to this, will be part of the new spring of Europe, the renaissance of European values, which would create a, quote, new equilibrium where the dominance of France and Germany is diminished.
[01:01:54.697 --> 01:01:59.481]  He went on to say that the upcoming European parliamentary election set for May
[01:02:00.308 --> 01:02:07.146]  Where Le Pen at the moment, by the way, is currently the most popular leader in France, above Macron by a significant stretch.
[01:02:07.819 --> 01:02:11.942]  Could lead away from a Europe quote that is run by bureaucrats.
[01:02:12.502 --> 01:02:26.331]  So now he's openly talking of a European spring as we head towards the European elections in May as the yellow vest movement becomes more and more visible as France debates passing laws to basically criminalize protest.
[01:02:26.831 --> 01:02:34.436]  Because again, as I met the point in the video, which we're going to play in the next segment, authoritarians, globalist authoritarians like Macron,
[01:02:35.347 --> 01:02:39.309]  The only response they know to disobedience is violence.
[01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:44.871]  And we've seen literally people having their eyeballs blown out, having their hands blown off.
[01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:54.114]  The mainstream media is never going to show you any of that footage, but it's been happening now for the past eight weeks, minimum, across France.
[01:02:54.814 --> 01:03:00.457]  And people are beginning to describe this as a European spring, even as Salvini adopts that term as well.
[01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.958]  As the bank run is planned for this weekend,
[01:03:05.023 --> 01:03:11.388]  Meanwhile in Germany, Antifa group claims responsibility for attempted assassination of German AFD politician.
[01:03:11.769 --> 01:03:18.995]  Yet another news story that was mentioned by the mainstream media but got nowhere near the top billing that it deserved.
[01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:21.817]  Imagine if a right-wing mob
[01:03:22.941 --> 01:03:29.724]  had almost beaten to death and attempted to assassinate a top member of Angela Merkel's party in Germany.
[01:03:30.144 --> 01:03:33.206]  That would be the top story across the globe.
[01:03:33.266 --> 01:03:35.507]  It would be at least, you know, above the fold.
[01:03:36.107 --> 01:03:37.728]  This, again, was buried.
[01:03:38.168 --> 01:03:38.948]  They mentioned it.
[01:03:39.408 --> 01:03:42.690]  It was way down the page on any front page of any mainstream website.
[01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:49.573]  And in a now-deleted post on a popular far-left website, an Antifa group has claimed responsibility
[01:03:50.478 --> 01:03:58.903]  For the assassination attempt on AFD MP Frank Magnitz, saying they wanted to free him from his fascist ideas.
[01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:05.787]  Oh, they were doing him a favour by leaving him with a 8-inch gash down his forehead and his face, which nearly killed him.
[01:04:05.807 --> 01:04:06.788]  They were doing him a favour.
[01:04:07.488 --> 01:04:20.036]  So again, this is the environment the media has built up, especially in Germany, by denouncing, by dehumanising AFD politicians, despite, according to many polls, it's now the second most popular party in Germany.
[01:04:20.706 --> 01:04:24.472]  Denouncing members of that party as fascists, as Nazis.
[01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:28.858]  Justifying violent attacks on those individuals.
[01:04:28.918 --> 01:04:34.486]  So again, that's why the media's not reporting on it, because they're partly to blame for it.
[01:04:34.847 --> 01:04:36.910]  Now the anti-fascist Spring Bremen
[01:04:37.782 --> 01:04:38.002]  Let's go!
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.961]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:05:05.461 --> 01:05:06.642]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:08.264]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:09.825]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.766 --> 01:05:15.009]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:18.872]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:19.473 --> 01:05:27.519]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.861]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:37.802]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:42.403]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:05:42.463 --> 01:05:48.364]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:05:48.404 --> 01:05:51.225]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:05:51.445 --> 01:05:52.685]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:52.945 --> 01:05:55.986]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[01:05:59.935 --> 01:06:09.783]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[01:06:09.983 --> 01:06:12.305]  News, analysis, reports.
[01:06:12.665 --> 01:06:14.406]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:14.687 --> 01:06:18.630]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:06:19.978 --> 01:06:28.524]  The French government is so terrified of the Yellow Vest movement, they're debating new laws that would criminalize all unauthorized protests.
[01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:35.128]  Meaning you would need government permission to protest the government, otherwise known as dictatorship or martial law.
[01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:41.432]  Protest leaders are now being handcuffed and abducted in the night, like something out of starzy East Germany.
[01:06:41.512 --> 01:06:45.615]  Yellow Vest organizer Eric Drouet was arrested and faces trial for quote,
[01:06:55.781 --> 01:07:03.445]  When your city looks like a screenshot from an apocalyptic video game every weekend, something's gone drastically wrong.
[01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:07.327]  On Saturday, Cannes looks more like a battlefield than a city.
[01:07:07.447 --> 01:07:11.249]  The Virgin Antifa rioter versus the Chad French rioter.
[01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:16.532]  Hides behind a mask, poses no real threat to authority, just break s*** with no purpose.
[01:07:16.652 --> 01:07:18.353]  Sports a sexy yellow vest,
[01:07:19.734 --> 01:07:24.536]  Now you know I don't advocate violence.
[01:07:24.616 --> 01:07:28.177]  And this guy claims he was angry because his wife got tear gassed.
[01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:37.041]  But when Christoph Dettinger, despite being targeted by the media and authorities, doxxed and having his home raided, becomes an overnight icon.
[01:07:37.341 --> 01:07:39.783]  You know whose side the public are on.
[01:07:39.843 --> 01:07:45.147]  I don't want to see Paris torn up, but when Antifa attacks banks, the left cheers.
[01:07:45.247 --> 01:07:49.930]  When yellow vests do the same, it's a dark carbinger of a fascist takeover.
[01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:58.957]  But President Macron is a globalist authoritarian, and the only way authoritarians know how to react to disobedience is with violence.
[01:07:59.137 --> 01:08:06.302]  But the underpaid and overworked French police will eventually join their fellow countrymen, and the king will have no clothes.
[01:08:06.502 --> 01:08:17.186]  As Tom Luongo writes, the Yellow Vest Movement is coffin nails for the EU because it illustrates how the EU is a scam and all of its policies were designed to do exactly what it's done.
[01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:28.270]  Impoverish the working classes, enrich the aristocracy, and enforce it through a Byzantine bureaucracy that makes the world of Terry Gilliam's Brazil look like a Toyota factory floor.
[01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:31.792]  Now Yellow Vest activists are tearing down EU flags.
[01:08:32.012 --> 01:08:36.055]  When he was elected, Macron was hailed as the saviour of globalism.
[01:08:36.135 --> 01:08:45.820]  Little over a year later, and his approval rating is at 23%, while his citizens are using forklift trucks to smash into the Ministry of Finance and Economy building.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:54.065]  Meanwhile, the establishment has set in motion a character assassination of the small but growing Yellow Vest movement in the UK.
[01:08:54.205 --> 01:08:56.787]  Ramona MP Anna Soubry was called
[01:08:59.164 --> 01:09:10.193]  She was called a Nazi, prompting a contrived hysterical media narrative that new laws need to be passed to prevent the abuse of politicians.
[01:09:10.273 --> 01:09:16.819]  Because Anna Soubry would never smear ordinary working class people as Nazis or fascists, would she?
[01:09:17.059 --> 01:09:20.160]  These are fascists, fascists, fascists, fascists.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.781]  Owen Jones is the voice of the working class.
[01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:26.342]  These gentlemen were just the wrong kind of working class.
[01:09:26.382 --> 01:09:26.542]  Yeah.
[01:09:26.682 --> 01:09:32.744]  Where was the outrage when Jacob Rees-Mogg's children were being abused by vile left-wing thugs?
[01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:39.571]  How about Nigel Farage's family being repeatedly attacked and abused?
[01:09:39.671 --> 01:09:46.277]  So there is a real double standard here that those of us that have taken on the establishment have to endure the abuse.
[01:09:46.737 --> 01:09:51.262]  Those within the establishment get a taste of it and suddenly they want the law changed.
[01:09:51.442 --> 01:09:54.124]  The left has been pulling stunts like that for years.
[01:09:54.224 --> 01:10:00.128]  But as soon as one establishment MP gets a bit of lip, you all freak out and wet the bed.
[01:10:00.188 --> 01:10:01.149]  Give me a break!
[01:10:01.349 --> 01:10:07.133]  A right-wing AFD politician in Germany is beaten almost to death by left-wing terrorists.
[01:10:07.373 --> 01:10:08.974]  And it barely makes the news.
[01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:14.836]  While every screaming top headline for two days was about someone being mean to Anna Zubri.
[01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:21.678]  And it was all part of a coordinated scheme to digitally assassinate one of the leaders of the UK Yellow Vest movement.
[01:10:21.738 --> 01:10:23.238]  Social media accounts banned.
[01:10:23.378 --> 01:10:24.719]  PayPal accounts deleted.
[01:10:24.919 --> 01:10:25.479]  Doxing.
[01:10:25.759 --> 01:10:28.160]  Journalists harassing their elderly parents.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.761]  Thousands of jihadists roaming our streets every day.
[01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:33.882]  People being stabbed to death every single day.
[01:10:34.342 --> 01:10:38.106]  Gotta get those dangerous 13-year-old girls off the streets, though!
[01:10:38.206 --> 01:10:45.893]  Then there's this bizarre footage out of Holland, which shows a woman wearing a yellow vest being dragged away from a baby stroller by police.
[01:10:46.013 --> 01:10:52.398]  The incident was apparently some kind of police training or social experiment, but it's disturbing nonetheless.
[01:10:52.599 --> 01:10:56.322]  Basically, the yellow vest is the new anonymous mask.
[01:10:56.542 --> 01:11:01.146]  It's a unifying emblem for anti-establishment fervor across Europe.
[01:11:01.287 --> 01:11:06.992]  And it seems the only thing more provocative than yellow vests is German women who wear their hair in braids.
[01:11:07.172 --> 01:11:11.937]  We are now here at Chemnitz station and were really stopped by the police.
[01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:21.045]  And I was really asked what kind of political opinion I have, whether I do not represent a right-wing opinion because I have braids.
[01:11:21.786 --> 01:11:38.577]  There's also speculation raging, which is unconfirmed at this point, that governments are already conspiring with mainstream media networks to release pre-written stories if tensions escalate that will do everything possible to minimise the chance of events being seen as a European spring.
[01:11:38.757 --> 01:11:44.801]  We've already seen mainstream TV channels in France photoshopping and censoring anti-Macron protest signs.
[01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:52.431]  The yellow vest movement utterly terrifies the elite because it unites aspects of both the left and the right.
[01:11:52.451 --> 01:12:01.823]  As French philosopher Alain de Benoist points out, the yellow vest movement is historic because it unites people with shared grievances from both sides of the political spectrum.
[01:12:01.903 --> 01:12:03.685]  Let's get one thing clear.
[01:12:04.045 --> 01:12:11.491]  The reason the establishment hates the Yellow Vest Movement is because the establishment hates the working class.
[01:12:11.591 --> 01:12:20.078]  The reason why left-wing mouthpieces like Owen Jones and lovey celebrities hate the Yellow Vest Movement is because they hate the working class.
[01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:22.721]  The working class are not capable of making important decisions.
[01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:26.324]  That's why they are the working class instead of leaders and professionals.
[01:12:26.364 --> 01:12:30.147]  You spent decades disingenuously pandering to the working class
[01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:32.488]  While feeling entitled to their vote.
[01:12:32.588 --> 01:12:37.951]  While offering them nothing but political and economic betrayal in return.
[01:12:38.031 --> 01:12:39.432]  Standards of living sunk.
[01:12:39.712 --> 01:12:41.153]  Wage growth stagnated.
[01:12:41.373 --> 01:12:42.933]  Fuel prices skyrocketed.
[01:12:43.214 --> 01:12:50.317]  And communities were destroyed thanks to your myopic insistence on importing millions of migrant wage slaves.
[01:12:50.537 --> 01:12:55.520]  Now the working class have finally got wise to it and withdrawn their support.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:03.482]  Prompting your thinly veiled disgust, elitism and snobbery to be fully revealed in all its fetid repulsiveness.
[01:13:03.682 --> 01:13:11.604]  I don't know where the yellow vest movement is going, but you can bet for a fact that the establishment's response is going to become more and more brutal.
[01:13:11.704 --> 01:13:21.727]  Proving once again that globalism can only be pursued at the expense of the freedoms, prosperity and dignity of ordinary working class people.
[01:13:25.598 --> 01:13:29.080]  That is what they're not telling you about the yellow vest.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.081]  It's up on YouTube right now.
[01:13:31.242 --> 01:13:33.863]  And in that video, you probably heard a German woman speaking.
[01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:36.905]  And we had this article up on m4wars.com yesterday.
[01:13:36.925 --> 01:13:39.407]  Again, absolutely incredible.
[01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:46.031]  Germany, please ask woman if she has right-wing political views because she's wearing braids.
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:57.904]  Yes, she had her hair in braids, she was wearing a beanie hat, she was at a Christmas market in Chemnitz, which is where they've had a lot of anti-mass migration protests.
[01:13:58.764 --> 01:14:10.689]  The cops came up to her and a group of friends, I think ostensibly because they wanted to breathalise one of them, even though they weren't even driving, they were just having some mulled wine at a Christmas market event.
[01:14:11.289 --> 01:14:13.150]  Then during the course of that confrontation,
[01:14:13.863 --> 01:14:22.887]  They asked the woman if she had right-wing political views because the reason they gave was because her hair was in braids.
[01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:24.728]  Why are they doing this?
[01:14:25.328 --> 01:14:43.017]  Well, because as we reported last month, the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs in Germany, this is a government body, has been working with a Berlin-based group called Amado Antonio Foundation, which according to some people has links to the old Stasi in Germany.
[01:14:43.743 --> 01:14:47.626]  They call it a watchdog organisation that tackles racism and hate speech.
[01:14:48.466 --> 01:14:50.968]  So the Federal Ministry in Germany is funding that group.
[01:14:52.129 --> 01:14:57.513]  The Federal Ministry for Family Affairs being a cabinet level ministry of the German government.
[01:14:58.573 --> 01:15:03.517]  And they put out a brochure for kindergarten teachers, this left wing hate speech monitor group.
[01:15:04.372 --> 01:15:07.513]  Which encourages children to spy on their right-wing parents.
[01:15:07.994 --> 01:15:20.659]  One particular description of two children whose parents supposedly belonged to a local right-wing group was particularly disturbing because it portrayed children adopting natural gender roles as being a right-wing trait.
[01:15:21.648 --> 01:15:24.810]  And the girl wears dresses and braids.
[01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:29.673]  You can't have little girls wearing dresses and having their hair in braids.
[01:15:30.014 --> 01:15:32.716]  That must mean that they're right-wing extremists.
[01:15:32.796 --> 01:15:40.821]  This is literally happening in Germany, even as, meanwhile, jihadist smuggling groups are being bussed up in Italy.
[01:15:41.545 --> 01:15:49.551]  They've arrested 15 suspects part of an organization that helped smuggle radical Islamic terrorists into the country as illegal migrants and asylum seekers.
[01:15:49.891 --> 01:15:51.673]  The police aren't concentrating on that.
[01:15:51.933 --> 01:15:56.136]  They're concentrating on little girls and women wearing their hair in braids.
[01:15:56.436 --> 01:15:57.717]  Absolutely absurd.
[01:15:58.177 --> 01:16:00.959]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[01:16:06.946 --> 01:16:18.898]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[01:16:20.106 --> 01:16:38.609]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.290]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:43.550]  Whole Foods was number two.
[01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:49.691]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:57.497]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[01:16:58.834 --> 01:17:12.503]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at Infowarslife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[01:17:13.404 --> 01:17:15.505]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[01:17:16.406 --> 01:17:19.308]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:20.088]  No response.
[01:17:20.308 --> 01:17:21.749]  They never want to get my comment.
[01:17:21.829 --> 01:17:22.710]  Now, why am I saying that?
[01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:24.391]  It's simple.
[01:17:25.421 --> 01:17:29.985]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[01:17:30.385 --> 01:17:35.670]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[01:17:36.331 --> 01:17:37.552]  So we have a great product.
[01:17:37.672 --> 01:17:38.092]  You love it.
[01:17:38.152 --> 01:17:38.773]  You reorder it.
[01:17:39.153 --> 01:17:41.415]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[01:17:41.896 --> 01:17:43.797]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[01:17:43.957 --> 01:17:45.018]  It's a 360 win.
[01:17:45.379 --> 01:17:46.039]  We defeat them.
[01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:46.500]  You win.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:46.960]  I win.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:47.761]  It's amazing.
[01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:54.413]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:54.453 --> 01:18:10.039]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[01:18:11.963 --> 01:18:12.483]  It's hard to believe.
[01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:15.304]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[01:18:15.384 --> 01:18:22.867]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:25.969]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[01:18:25.989 --> 01:18:35.493]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[01:18:35.593 --> 01:18:36.293]  But just know this.
[01:18:38.311 --> 01:18:46.435]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.976]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[01:18:49.716 --> 01:19:00.021]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:01.942]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:02.702]  I'm garbage.
[01:19:03.722 --> 01:19:05.363]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[01:19:05.563 --> 01:19:06.864]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[01:19:08.058 --> 01:19:09.399]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[01:19:10.059 --> 01:19:11.119]  Tumeric's dynamite.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.540]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:16.401]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:17.182]  It's all dynamite.
[01:19:18.742 --> 01:19:21.463]  They can tell you how great it is and show you all the facts and tell you.
[01:19:21.683 --> 01:19:22.624]  Because they're the elite.
[01:19:22.964 --> 01:19:23.664]  I'm just scum.
[01:19:24.285 --> 01:19:25.205]  Just like you, according to them.
[01:19:25.245 --> 01:19:27.666]  But the good news is you've seen how great these products work.
[01:19:28.026 --> 01:19:32.208]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at m4slife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[01:19:32.688 --> 01:19:33.868]  But experience Tumeric.
[01:19:33.948 --> 01:19:35.249]  Experience X3.
[01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:37.110]  Experience Super Mel Vitality.
[01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:49.560]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, Supermale Vitality Superfemale, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it, because it's so frustrating.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.763]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[01:19:52.923 --> 01:19:57.807]  Bodies, X3, and Supermale, at MFullWarsTore.com and MFullWarsLife.com.
[01:19:57.987 --> 01:19:58.728]  Thanks for your support.
[01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.730]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:23.453]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.833 --> 01:20:27.494]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:40.107]  You're live on the Thursday, January 10th edition of the Alex Jones Show, and ladies and gentlemen, it has happened again!
[01:20:40.947 --> 01:20:53.816]  Another left-wing couple preaching love, preaching acceptance, preaching tolerance, has visited a dangerous country to spread those utopian ideals, and they've disappeared.
[01:20:54.496 --> 01:20:58.259]  Likely abducted, maybe tragically dead.
[01:20:59.079 --> 01:20:59.639]  Headline!
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.083]  Yet another left-wing couple visits dangerous country to spread love, disappears.
[01:21:05.624 --> 01:21:20.236]  This was a Canadian, Edith Blase, and her Italian boyfriend, Luca Toccato, or Totecho, were travelling in West African country of Burkina Faso, when all communications with their families abruptly ceased on December 15th.
[01:21:20.616 --> 01:21:23.959]  It's thought the pair were kidnapped, although their whereabouts remain unknown.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.022]  The woman, Edith Blase,
[01:21:28.638 --> 01:21:30.479]  That apparently posted on Facebook.
[01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:33.181]  Now, this is unconfirmed, but it looks like her picture.
[01:21:33.881 --> 01:21:38.304]  She's holding up a sign in Arabic with Iraq written on it on a piece of cardboard.
[01:21:38.344 --> 01:21:41.345]  If you just scroll down a bit, it's right there on Facebook.
[01:21:42.586 --> 01:21:45.468]  Now, it's unknown whether she wrote these words, but it looks like her picture.
[01:21:45.528 --> 01:21:46.709]  People are saying this is her.
[01:21:46.849 --> 01:21:50.651]  Again, unconfirmed, but it says hitchhiking Iraq.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.703]  I just wanted to share that there is love and warmth everywhere in the world.
[01:21:55.003 --> 01:21:57.585]  You just need the wisdom and courage to reach out and grasp it.
[01:21:57.945 --> 01:21:59.066]  Open your minds and hearts.
[01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:04.690]  We are the people showing others that the world is a place in which solo females can travel to its far corners.
[01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:06.451]  Happy 2019.
[01:22:06.892 --> 01:22:08.513]  Let's hit the road.
[01:22:08.993 --> 01:22:09.794]  Well, she did that.
[01:22:10.811 --> 01:22:12.293]  She travelled to Burkina Faso.
[01:22:12.733 --> 01:22:27.247]  She travelled to Mali, despite the area being riddled with terrorists and violent criminals, despite Canadian government travel advisories warning against or wanting to avoid all unnecessary travel to the country of both Mali and certain areas of Burkina Faso.
[01:22:28.048 --> 01:22:30.010]  And now she's disappeared.
[01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:33.233]  No contact with her family for nearly a month now.
[01:22:33.897 --> 01:22:46.485]  They were on their way to the capital of Burkina Faso, despite the fact that six Canadians were killed there by Islamic jihadists who stormed a hotel during a 2016 terror attack.
[01:22:48.167 --> 01:22:53.170]  Now, this article features a quote from Gar Party, who is a former Director General of Consular Affairs.
[01:22:54.122 --> 01:22:56.483]  And served as an ambassador to multiple countries.
[01:22:56.523 --> 01:23:02.365]  He said, quote, Canada's travel advisory for Burkina Faso is about as explicit as you can make these things.
[01:23:02.865 --> 01:23:05.126]  It's a very troubled country.
[01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:14.749]  This is a country where terrorists and violent criminals will just randomly shoot at vehicles to carry out carjackings, to carry out violent attacks.
[01:23:16.289 --> 01:23:20.753]  Quote, armed criminals don't hesitate to shoot at vehicles to stop and rob their occupants.
[01:23:20.853 --> 01:23:25.197]  Such incidents can happen day or night on both main and secondary roads.
[01:23:25.257 --> 01:23:29.421]  That's from Global Affairs Canada, the group that puts out the travel advisories.
[01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:35.266]  So you have yet another left-wing couple, by all accounts.
[01:23:36.332 --> 01:23:44.559]  And other reports state that Blase was intending to travel to Togo, where she planned to volunteer with an organization attempting to reforest parts of Togo.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.121]  So this is obviously an environmentalist.
[01:23:47.682 --> 01:23:48.903]  She's got dreadlocks.
[01:23:49.443 --> 01:23:52.726]  I think it's safe to say she looks pretty liberal.
[01:23:52.986 --> 01:24:01.794]  And if this Facebook post is true, if it's her words, she's holding up a sign in Arabic, basically talking about love and acceptance and the fact that
[01:24:02.449 --> 01:24:10.478]  Females on their own, even though she wasn't even on her own, she was with a boyfriend, can travel solo to far corners of the world.
[01:24:10.798 --> 01:24:23.813]  This post was made after the Islamic jihadist slaughter and beheading of two female Scandinavian tourists who of course travelled to Morocco to hike in the mountains of Morocco.
[01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:30.716]  As some of you may have seen the horrific video were basically raped and beheaded by ISIS supporters.
[01:24:31.117 --> 01:24:34.641]  Now if these were one-off isolated cases it wouldn't be a story.
[01:24:34.881 --> 01:24:36.963]  They're not one-off isolated cases.
[01:24:37.604 --> 01:24:43.230]  We had the other case of the left-wing couple who cycled through the Middle East through the Balkans
[01:24:44.255 --> 01:24:45.616]  They again preached love.
[01:24:45.656 --> 01:24:54.984]  They preached that evil does not exist in the world and the conception that other cultures are more dangerous, more bigoted, less tolerant than our own.
[01:24:55.444 --> 01:24:58.466]  That was just a product of our own bigotry.
[01:24:59.647 --> 01:25:02.670]  Our own Western imperialism that we expect
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.581]  These countries to be dangerous.
[01:25:05.621 --> 01:25:06.741]  They're not really dangerous.
[01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:07.782]  Everybody's friendly.
[01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.543]  Everybody just wants to spread love.
[01:25:09.963 --> 01:25:20.188]  Absolute BS and people are dying over and over again because of these utopian delusions that the world is just full of nice people who do not want to do you harm.
[01:25:21.468 --> 01:25:29.912]  And because of this view that there aren't some countries which are more safe than others, that there aren't some cultures which are better than others when there are.
[01:25:30.372 --> 01:25:31.953]  And again, this goes to the border point.
[01:25:32.907 --> 01:25:43.794]  We have now a breaking news story which says that the White House Counsel's Office is prepping legal justification for a national emergency where Trump might declare the national emergency to build the wall.
[01:25:44.134 --> 01:25:50.698]  We have people like Anna Navarro on CNN as guests talk about American citizens murdered by illegal aliens.
[01:25:50.718 --> 01:25:56.141]  She's literally filing her nails during this live interview, showing complete disinterest.
[01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.403]  This is why we have borders.
[01:25:59.289 --> 01:26:04.697]  To keep out dangerous violent criminals, to keep out dangerous terrorists.
[01:26:05.057 --> 01:26:12.207]  Yet the left has this utopian idea that everybody's accepting and embracing and tolerant and just wants to spread love like them.
[01:26:12.227 --> 01:26:14.891]  No, it's complete BS.
[01:26:15.936 --> 01:26:22.060]  I put out a video about this called The Tragedy of Cultural Relativism on Christmas Eve.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.161]  It's got nearly a million views on Facebook.
[01:26:24.481 --> 01:26:40.050]  I go through every single example, not just the one today that we're talking about, not just the two Scandinavian female tourists in Morocco raped and beheaded, but people like Pippa Bacca, the Italian woman, who again hitched hike across all these dangerous countries
[01:26:41.073 --> 01:26:46.859]  Said she was doing so to quote, send a message of peace and marriage between different peoples and nations again.
[01:26:46.879 --> 01:26:50.942]  Another left-wing activist raped, strangled, murdered.
[01:26:52.184 --> 01:26:54.946]  I'd went through a whole litany, a whole list of these people.
[01:26:55.046 --> 01:26:59.951]  Ellen Krantz, a Swedish supporter of multiculturalism and a strong advocate of mass immigration.
[01:27:00.914 --> 01:27:09.581]  She literally posted on her Facebook page called, We Like Diversity, what happened to her, raped and killed by an Ethiopian immigrant and dumped in a forest.
[01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:11.963]  She didn't even have to leave Sweden for that to happen to her.
[01:27:11.983 --> 01:27:23.973]  20-year-old Eli Warren, a left-wing environmentalist, she visited Mozambique for the pumping nightlife, for the experience of all these great, wonderful, eclectic, different cultures.
[01:27:24.633 --> 01:27:30.378]  She went there to, quote, help others less fortunate than herself, raped, murdered, dumped in a toilet block.
[01:27:31.869 --> 01:27:34.010]  Again, it goes on and on and on.
[01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:36.911]  In that one video, I think I point to about eight different examples.
[01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:50.057]  Of course, the cyclists, which I mentioned before, they literally put out blogs saying that evil doesn't exist in the world, that our view that evil exists in these more dangerous parts of the world is just a product of our own imperialist bigotry.
[01:27:51.138 --> 01:27:52.578]  They were cycling in Tajikistan.
[01:27:52.878 --> 01:27:56.620]  ISIS terrorists mowed them down in vehicles and stabbed them to death.
[01:27:57.583 --> 01:28:00.025]  There are literally dozens and dozens of these cases.
[01:28:00.325 --> 01:28:04.889]  I probably covered about 10 or 12 in the video, and there's a new one out just today.
[01:28:04.989 --> 01:28:07.611]  Again, this is why we have borders.
[01:28:08.151 --> 01:28:11.714]  To keep out these kind of dangerous, violent criminals.
[01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:17.579]  Not to keep out legal immigrants, to keep out illegal immigrants and protect our own people.
[01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:20.241]  Again, why do you lock your door at night?
[01:28:20.581 --> 01:28:25.525]  It's not because you hate the people outside, it's because you love the people inside.
[01:28:26.508 --> 01:28:31.229]  But they travel to these foreign countries with these utopian delusions.
[01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:36.710]  They go to the to the worst assholes imaginable, because then they think they can come back.
[01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:48.052]  And that's a form of virtue signaling to say that they went to these remote, horrific places where poverty is widespread, where violent crime is widespread, because they want to get some kind of reflection and say, oh, look at me.
[01:28:48.092 --> 01:28:49.452]  I'm so open, so tolerant.
[01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:51.172]  I can go to these places and love them.
[01:28:51.232 --> 01:28:51.993]  Nothing happens to me.
[01:28:52.013 --> 01:28:52.313]  It's great.
[01:28:52.353 --> 01:28:54.473]  Everyone's peaceful, loving what happens.
[01:28:55.217 --> 01:28:57.918]  In many cases, tragically raped and killed.
[01:28:58.098 --> 01:28:58.958]  When are they going to learn?
[01:28:59.298 --> 01:29:01.619]  We'll be back with Owen Shroyer, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:01.639 --> 01:29:02.199]  Don't go away.
[01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:06.600]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:13.482]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[01:29:13.962 --> 01:29:23.304]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[01:29:23.864 --> 01:29:25.065]  Gut-level, just couldn't do it.
[01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.967]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[01:29:28.528 --> 01:29:44.920]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes, everybody knows about it on so many fronts, and helps a lot of people.
[01:29:45.632 --> 01:29:53.798]  The reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[01:29:54.631 --> 01:30:14.524]  But now they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[01:30:15.284 --> 01:30:17.526]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[01:30:18.519 --> 01:30:22.220]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:22.920]  They're patriots.
[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:34.584]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[01:30:35.144 --> 01:30:35.984]  You drop ship it.
[01:30:36.084 --> 01:30:36.705]  You get it out.
[01:30:36.905 --> 01:30:37.785]  You have the website.
[01:30:38.405 --> 01:30:39.005]  I promote it.
[01:30:39.185 --> 01:30:40.066]  I send people there.
[01:30:40.346 --> 01:30:43.287]  And that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[01:30:43.967 --> 01:30:47.428]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[01:30:48.564 --> 01:30:58.167]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[01:30:58.947 --> 01:31:03.688]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[01:31:03.968 --> 01:31:12.051]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[01:31:13.257 --> 01:31:23.386]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:25.488]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[01:31:25.528 --> 01:31:26.108]  I've researched it.
[01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:31.613]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who would want to sponsor us in the last six years.
[01:31:31.693 --> 01:31:33.034]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:45.767]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[01:31:47.071 --> 01:31:54.917]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[01:31:55.598 --> 01:32:11.830]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all, because they have more than 40 products.
[01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:14.973]  Now, remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[01:32:15.173 --> 01:32:16.173]  They've tried to shut us down.
[01:32:16.934 --> 01:32:18.134]  They've tried to boycott us.
[01:32:18.154 --> 01:32:18.954]  They've tried to sue us.
[01:32:19.475 --> 01:32:25.956]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[01:32:26.176 --> 01:32:33.937]  We're still going to do that with InfoWarsLife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[01:32:34.038 --> 01:32:35.858]  And this is the first big one.
[01:32:36.238 --> 01:32:37.078]  So I'm very excited.
[01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:37.898]  Be sure and go there.
[01:32:37.958 --> 01:32:45.580]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the highest quality,
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:33:02.405]  The lowest prices, it's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the info war the whole time.
[01:33:06.466 --> 01:33:09.567]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.821]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:26.081 --> 01:33:27.222]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.823 --> 01:33:29.204]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.764 --> 01:33:32.807]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.827 --> 01:33:34.288]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:39.312]  I've got so much news to get to here.
[01:33:40.453 --> 01:33:45.837]  It's just so wide-ranging and really so important.
[01:33:47.859 --> 01:33:51.082]  And I'm probably not going to have the time to get to half of it here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:52.165 --> 01:33:54.406]  And then I pick up and host the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:54.446 --> 01:33:54.766]  Central.
[01:33:54.786 --> 01:33:58.468]  Doug Hagman will be hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:58.488 --> 01:33:59.569]  Stuart Rhodes is going to join me at 1.
[01:33:59.949 --> 01:34:03.951]  I have a guest with me right now, Simon Roche from swedelanders.org.
[01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:13.096]  We're going to talk with him in just a minute, but we've been on air for an hour and a half today, and we have not even plugged ourselves.
[01:34:14.197 --> 01:34:16.638]  Now, you'll notice we don't have big sponsors.
[01:34:17.099 --> 01:34:19.160]  We don't have the pharmaceutical ads at every break.
[01:34:20.632 --> 01:34:31.758]  If you take this pill and experience nausea, or loss of breath, or dehydration, or your head falls off, or you die, please contact this number immediately.
[01:34:32.479 --> 01:34:34.120]  You notice how you don't get any of that here?
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:41.684]  And media funds itself with corporate sponsors, or independent sponsors, or
[01:34:42.972 --> 01:34:48.975]  Anything like that, and you hear these names, you hear these businesses, this is how news is able to fund itself, hire people, and go live.
[01:34:49.655 --> 01:34:55.538]  We haven't even plugged for an hour and a half, and this is a multi-million dollar news organization.
[01:34:56.058 --> 01:34:57.459]  That's how much it costs to run this.
[01:34:58.099 --> 01:35:05.583]  InfoWars now employs a hundred people between the shipping, the marketing, the graphics, the live crew, and everything, and we don't even plug.
[01:35:05.603 --> 01:35:09.125]  So, folks, at InfoWarsStore.com,
[01:35:10.487 --> 01:35:12.449]  We give you great products.
[01:35:13.449 --> 01:35:17.873]  We don't just have InfoWars Store so that we can sponsor ourselves and fund ourselves.
[01:35:17.993 --> 01:35:24.919]  We know that, first of all, supplements and that industry is huge right now in the modern day lifestyle.
[01:35:24.939 --> 01:35:28.642]  A lot of people supplement, use supplements to stay healthy.
[01:35:28.702 --> 01:35:31.124]  So we just give you the best supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:31.484 --> 01:35:34.807]  Not to mention the t-shirts, the hats, the emergency food supplies.
[01:35:35.788 --> 01:35:39.149]  Emergency gear, just all the amazing stuff we have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:39.449 --> 01:35:44.071]  Household items like shampoo, body wash, toothpaste, toothbrushes.
[01:35:44.531 --> 01:35:48.392]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com, but some of the main specials we have going right now.
[01:35:49.632 --> 01:35:52.613]  50% off bodies, which is a top-selling, top-rated supplement.
[01:35:53.594 --> 01:35:57.355]  50% off the brand-new, nascent triiodine Survival Shield X3.
[01:35:57.855 --> 01:36:01.516]  And 50% off Supermail Vitality, which we are in our last run of.
[01:36:01.576 --> 01:36:04.177]  Now, we did make a big surplus order
[01:36:04.537 --> 01:36:04.797]  I don't know.
[01:36:19.764 --> 01:36:30.887]  We really only go as far as you take us, and the more gasoline you put in our tank to launch the Millennium Falcon, known as InfoWars.com, to the next level, the farther we will go.
[01:36:30.967 --> 01:36:36.149]  So thank you for your support at InfoWarsStore.com, and there is something at InfoWarsStore for you, I promise.
[01:36:37.089 --> 01:36:40.430]  Now, let's go to my guest, Simon Roche from Sweetlanders.org.
[01:36:41.872 --> 01:36:44.375]  There's all kinds of stuff I can get into here with Simon.
[01:36:44.456 --> 01:36:54.329]  Obviously what's going on in South Africa, where the Democrats act like there's nothing going on, there's no racism, there's no attack against white people and their farmlands.
[01:36:54.509 --> 01:36:56.352]  It's just not even happening according to the Democrats.
[01:36:56.913 --> 01:36:57.834]  But then there's the...
[01:36:58.655 --> 01:37:04.936]  Kind of, let's bring that issue home and say, well, how does this apply to the West?
[01:37:05.056 --> 01:37:10.697]  What do we see happening in South Africa that we can try to avoid happening in the West?
[01:37:11.137 --> 01:37:17.778]  Of course, the race war aspect is one of this, but it's also a culture war.
[01:37:17.838 --> 01:37:26.600]  So Simon, talk about the culture war that is happening in South Africa right now and what the West needs to be aware of to avoid it.
[01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:38.169]  Owen, the most outstanding feature of what's happening in South Africa now, if you draw a comparison with the West, is the similarity.
[01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:55.619]  The simple reality is that the same methods are being applied in South Africa, albeit that we're a little bit further along the curve than you guys are in the Northern Hemisphere, that is to say in Canada and the USA and in Western Europe.
[01:37:56.272 --> 01:38:09.622]  The same methods as are being applied to you and they begin by telling you that your culture is wrong and your values are wrong and the things that your forefathers did are wrong and therefore you should atone for it and nobody else can be wrong.
[01:38:10.023 --> 01:38:21.992]  Anybody else can only be a victim but you as a, to put it in stereotypical terms and not to exaggerate the comparison, but you as a white male
[01:38:22.839 --> 01:38:29.446]  from the Western European Christian tradition are wrong and everybody else is a victim.
[01:38:29.887 --> 01:38:34.672]  And therefore you must atone for it and you must compromise on other people's terms.
[01:38:35.172 --> 01:38:38.696]  That is the salient feature of what you've just spoken about.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:48.703]  Well, and I was actually thinking about this, because it's like every day there's more and more racism against white people in the United States of America.
[01:38:48.723 --> 01:38:50.044]  I mean, whatever.
[01:38:50.204 --> 01:38:53.565]  I'm not even sitting here saying there's not racism against black people or brown people or anything.
[01:38:54.045 --> 01:39:00.768]  I'm just saying the racism against white people in the United States is the most publicly on display of any of it.
[01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:03.729]  But then they say, oh, you can't be racist against white people.
[01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:06.550]  But you just hit on what I was thinking last night.
[01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:14.323]  The reason why they demonize white men in the West is because that's the only way you can tear down America's founding.
[01:39:14.343 --> 01:39:15.665]  You see, the founding fathers were white.
[01:39:16.451 --> 01:39:28.700]  So what you do is, you demonize the white man, say the white man is the problem for everything, then you can go back in time and say, oh look, it was white men that founded America, therefore America must be evil, racist, and can't exist.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:39.328]  So, it's the destruction of the white man in the West, which is what they're going to use as part and parcel of a bigger plan to destroy the foundations of America.
[01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:42.949]  You couldn't be more correct.
[01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:47.811]  The operative word, though, for me, and what you've just said, is the they, they, they.
[01:39:47.831 --> 01:39:55.354]  The they is not the, let's say, African Americans or Mexicans or whoever.
[01:39:56.795 --> 01:40:07.319]  You may feel some kind of loggerheads with the Western European cultural tradition in the USA, South Africa and elsewhere.
[01:40:07.859 --> 01:40:09.720]  It is our primary enemy.
[01:40:10.425 --> 01:40:16.993]  In South Africa, as it is the case in the USA, is not the black African people of South Africa.
[01:40:17.474 --> 01:40:18.315]  It is the they.
[01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:46.290]  The intellectual elite, the academic elite, the liberal elite, and the other elites who come up with these fancy schmancy ideas and then ram them down the throats of the cannon fodder, as it were, brainwashing them to believe in all sorts of things that they never believed before, that never occurred to them before, that are not intrinsic or inherent in their cultural understanding of the paradigms of the human condition.
[01:40:47.057 --> 01:40:51.199]  And they adopt this stuff and then they, as I say, act as cannon fodder.
[01:40:51.219 --> 01:40:56.502]  And I think that's a very important thing for people to understand, both in the USA and in South Africa.
[01:40:57.163 --> 01:41:06.608]  Our primary enemy in South Africa is not the black man that the liberals stereotypically paint us with.
[01:41:06.628 --> 01:41:08.509]  You know, you hate black people.
[01:41:09.150 --> 01:41:10.572]  Bulldust, man!
[01:41:10.953 --> 01:41:15.058]  These crazy ideas didn't emanate from within black African culture.
[01:41:15.399 --> 01:41:19.885]  They emanated from the super intellectuals in the most elite universities.
[01:41:20.586 --> 01:41:23.150]  And there is clearly some
[01:41:24.056 --> 01:41:25.977]  Orchestration, if you look at it that way.
[01:41:26.558 --> 01:41:28.479]  You begin to see that it's not spontaneous.
[01:41:28.519 --> 01:41:29.780]  For what that's worth to you, Owen?
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:30.861]  No, absolutely.
[01:41:30.901 --> 01:41:32.462]  It's an indoctrination process.
[01:41:32.822 --> 01:41:35.464]  I'm more familiar with it in America, obviously, than South Africa.
[01:41:35.564 --> 01:41:38.446]  It's an indoctrination process that happens in the public schools.
[01:41:38.886 --> 01:41:39.947]  It happens in the media.
[01:41:40.407 --> 01:41:45.910]  And so it just becomes kind of passe, modern parlance to, oh yeah, just blame the white man for everything.
[01:41:46.651 --> 01:41:49.053]  But you hit on something that's key to kind of
[01:41:50.043 --> 01:42:01.314]  Make clear here, I go to these events and most of the people attacking me because I'm white, like you said, they're not Mexican, they're not Latino, most of them aren't even black.
[01:42:01.354 --> 01:42:09.582]  I mean, quite frankly, when I get attacked for being white, it's 90% of the time other white liberals that fall for the indoctrination.
[01:42:09.602 --> 01:42:14.187]  Of course you're going to have some black people that hate white people, of course you're going to have some white people that probably don't like other
[01:42:14.847 --> 01:42:15.488]  Skin color people.
[01:42:15.508 --> 01:42:16.569]  You're going to have that in any group.
[01:42:17.289 --> 01:42:35.684]  But it's the ideological left in America that has been primed and ready to go out into the physical world and launch this movement against white people and claim that every white man is racist and Nazi now, white supremacist, responsible for everything.
[01:42:36.004 --> 01:42:38.686]  And so this is what they're pushing to destroy America.
[01:42:38.726 --> 01:42:41.648]  So yeah, it's really easy to deceive somebody
[01:42:42.429 --> 01:42:42.669]  What's up?
[01:43:09.454 --> 01:43:11.195]  Let's go to Wildman in Illinois.
[01:43:11.235 --> 01:43:13.557]  Thanks for holding and about to say Happy New Year.
[01:43:13.577 --> 01:43:13.857]  Go ahead.
[01:43:14.158 --> 01:43:14.418]  Alex.
[01:43:14.638 --> 01:43:14.878]  Yeah.
[01:43:14.898 --> 01:43:23.645]  Going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[01:43:23.705 --> 01:43:24.866]  That's how he saves America.
[01:43:24.926 --> 01:43:27.848]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hardworking, honest man.
[01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:28.629]  That's what I believe.
[01:43:28.889 --> 01:43:29.209]  I agree.
[01:43:29.289 --> 01:43:30.029]  Victory or death.
[01:43:30.089 --> 01:43:31.770]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:33.571]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[01:43:34.131 --> 01:43:36.672]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[01:43:37.052 --> 01:43:39.332]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[01:43:39.352 --> 01:43:41.073]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[01:43:41.113 --> 01:43:41.653]  It's already begun.
[01:43:41.673 --> 01:43:43.754]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[01:43:44.174 --> 01:43:49.576]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[01:43:49.936 --> 01:43:50.556]  So just get ready.
[01:43:50.856 --> 01:43:51.316]  I'd say.
[01:43:51.396 --> 01:43:54.998]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[01:43:55.198 --> 01:43:57.659]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[01:43:57.839 --> 01:43:58.860]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.140]  I want to thank you.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:07.624]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[01:44:08.304 --> 01:44:09.745]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:44:10.865 --> 01:44:11.926]  They're taking everybody.
[01:44:11.966 --> 01:44:13.727]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:44:13.787 --> 01:44:16.888]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[01:44:16.948 --> 01:44:18.689]  That's why this is a war.
[01:44:19.309 --> 01:44:20.810]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:22.371]  Which products do you like the best?
[01:44:22.491 --> 01:44:24.072]  Man, I use the bodies.
[01:44:24.152 --> 01:44:25.352]  I got so many t-shirts.
[01:44:25.372 --> 01:44:26.473]  It ain't even funny.
[01:44:26.513 --> 01:44:31.135]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[01:44:31.576 --> 01:44:35.137]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[01:44:35.438 --> 01:44:36.578]  I spread the word about you.
[01:44:36.758 --> 01:44:40.220]  I wear your clothes, your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:41.661]  Multitude of products.
[01:44:41.981 --> 01:44:45.303]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[01:44:45.623 --> 01:44:52.554]  Um, you know, it's, uh, people skeptical, but, like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[01:44:52.614 --> 01:44:55.358]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[01:45:06.844 --> 01:45:10.146]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[01:45:10.446 --> 01:45:15.350]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:17.251]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[01:45:17.351 --> 01:45:21.053]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[01:45:21.193 --> 01:45:23.195]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[01:45:23.215 --> 01:45:34.342]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:37.304]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[01:45:37.424 --> 01:45:38.525]  How about physical wealth?
[01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:40.907]  When I forget to pick my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[01:45:41.427 --> 01:45:42.488]  We have X2.
[01:45:42.568 --> 01:45:47.832]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it at 12,000 feet.
[01:45:48.293 --> 01:45:49.814]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[01:45:49.994 --> 01:45:57.480]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize in this other form of iodine.
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:57.840]  Yeah.
[01:46:14.992 --> 01:46:17.354]  Raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt.
[01:46:17.434 --> 01:46:17.874]  But it's not.
[01:46:17.894 --> 01:46:18.475]  It says right here.
[01:46:18.655 --> 01:46:21.077]  Adding ionized iodine to the salt.
[01:46:21.137 --> 01:46:22.899]  Boosted IQ, 10 to 20 points.
[01:46:23.079 --> 01:46:24.039]  Increased fertility.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:27.542]  They put it in the water the kids are given at school in China.
[01:46:27.803 --> 01:46:28.663]  Why do I say that?
[01:46:28.763 --> 01:46:41.834]  Because in the 20s, we had major reproductive problems, major deformities, major retardation, major IQ reduction, not on the coastal areas where people got fresh fish that had some iodine in it, but in the Midwest.
[01:46:42.294 --> 01:46:45.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:22.304 --> 01:47:25.065]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:47:25.526 --> 01:47:30.408]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:47:31.769 --> 01:47:50.078]  I want to try to put a bookmark on where America is at right now, culturally, societally, and we're going to get Simon Roche's take on this, where it compares in the overall curve of globalism and propaganda.
[01:47:51.434 --> 01:48:00.484]  to South Africa but basically what you have is because America has become so wealthy and prosperous
[01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:13.198]  Most people have not had to really suffer or go through any real strain to enjoy the wealth and prosperity and freedom and independence of being an American citizen.
[01:48:13.939 --> 01:48:17.461]  And so they'll paint the picture that, oh, that's just a bunch of spoiled white people.
[01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:18.922]  No, that's everyone.
[01:48:19.463 --> 01:48:25.828]  That's everybody enjoying the prosperity and the wealth of America that's been created by the people that have suffered.
[01:48:26.823 --> 01:48:27.444]  To get us here.
[01:48:28.004 --> 01:48:30.267]  Yeah, that includes slaves that were black.
[01:48:30.307 --> 01:48:32.089]  That includes slaves that were Irish.
[01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:34.211]  That includes white people that settled the place.
[01:48:35.052 --> 01:48:36.533]  It includes all of America's history.
[01:48:38.755 --> 01:48:43.801]  But now, there's been an added ingredient
[01:48:44.727 --> 01:48:55.874]  Which is mainstream entertainment media force-feeding you the Kardashians, force-feeding you the real wives of Hollywood, force-feeding you all the glitz and the glamour.
[01:48:56.334 --> 01:49:04.900]  So you see rich, wealthy, successful people getting boats, living lavish lifestyles, and so that becomes the pop culture you see.
[01:49:06.521 --> 01:49:13.465]  And then all the wealth and prosperity that has made America the richest, most prosperous nation on Earth is being sucked away
[01:49:14.594 --> 01:49:16.755]  And it's starting to hit the average American household.
[01:49:17.355 --> 01:49:29.858]  But the youth still sees the media saying, oh, look at the Kardashians, look at Hollywood, look at the celebrities, they're rich, they're famous, they got big boats, they got big fancy cars, they go on big lavish vacations, they get the big, you know, million dollar ring on their finger.
[01:49:30.418 --> 01:49:32.339]  And so then the average American's like, well, why don't I get that?
[01:49:33.385 --> 01:49:37.326]  I didn't have to work for this wealth and prosperity in America, why don't I get the prosperity and wealth they get?
[01:49:37.686 --> 01:49:46.328]  So then they get frustrated because they can't attain that level of wealth and prosperity, at least in their mind, and most people can't!
[01:49:47.768 --> 01:49:48.748]  And so then they get angry.
[01:49:49.789 --> 01:49:51.249]  And then they want everything for free.
[01:49:52.169 --> 01:49:53.590]  And so then they need a scapegoat.
[01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:55.050]  Then they need somebody to blame.
[01:49:55.650 --> 01:49:59.671]  And then the media comes in again and gives them the anti-white propaganda.
[01:50:01.158 --> 01:50:04.540]  So that's basically where we're at culturally now.
[01:50:05.361 --> 01:50:29.137]  You have a bunch of spoiled rotten brats in the West that expect to get everything for free because that's the propaganda that they've been given, and they don't understand what it took for America to actually attain this level of freedom and prosperity, and so now they're willing, unwittingly, to throw it all away in the name of social justice because they believe that will be their deliverance.
[01:50:29.597 --> 01:50:33.320]  But in South Africa, they're ahead of where we're at right now in America.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:37.923]  They're actually taking land, they're actually killing people, and it's all being justified by the government.
[01:50:38.923 --> 01:50:52.533]  So, Simon, just talk about where South Africa is at on that curve of destroying South Africa's culture and just the people from getting along and what America needs to realize before we reach that level.
[01:50:55.802 --> 01:51:13.658]  Where we would differ with you guys quite strongly, not because of any special intuition or anything like that, purely because we have watched more of this movie than you have, is in the idea that the superficial assessment is the right assessment.
[01:51:14.038 --> 01:51:18.502]  We can see it happening in front of us, therefore this must be what is happening.
[01:51:18.982 --> 01:51:23.406]  Whereas in fact, we're much like an audience watching a Punch and Judy puppet show.
[01:51:24.754 --> 01:51:36.058]  And being woken up to the realities of this puppet show, punches punching Judy, Judy's hitting punch back and completely failing to recognize the puppet masters above it.
[01:51:36.578 --> 01:51:43.500]  And this is not as insightful or intuitive or clever as it may seem.
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:46.021]  Over time, this becomes obvious.
[01:51:46.061 --> 01:51:48.481]  It becomes obvious that these things are not spontaneous.
[01:51:49.682 --> 01:51:51.742]  They don't come from within the culture.
[01:51:52.323 --> 01:51:53.403]  They appear to do so.
[01:51:54.053 --> 01:52:03.477]  But with greater exposure and greater interrogation of this thing, you begin to see that it is injected into the culture.
[01:52:04.238 --> 01:52:07.399]  So what you say about the Kardashians and so on is perfectly true.
[01:52:07.479 --> 01:52:09.820]  On a superficial level, it is exactly what's happening.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.041]  But it is not the root cause.
[01:52:12.221 --> 01:52:14.022]  It is merely a symptom of something else.
[01:52:14.482 --> 01:52:20.445]  You begin to tell over time that these things are worked out centuries or decades in advance
[01:52:21.388 --> 01:52:28.912]  And they are worked out by the brightest minds in the world, whoever they may be, whether you believe in this theory or that theory or the other theory, is immaterial.
[01:52:29.292 --> 01:52:34.875]  The point is to begin to understand that it is deliberate and that it is orchestrated.
[01:52:35.895 --> 01:52:43.299]  Once you can begin to understand that, you can begin to fight it, because if you fight it on a superficial level, you just don't get anywhere.
[01:52:44.693 --> 01:52:56.103]  Well, and the proof of this comes from an old case, McCarthyism, where McCarthy, a former congressman, is saying, hey, look, our government's been infiltrated by communists.
[01:52:56.563 --> 01:52:59.026]  This is an immediate threat to our nation.
[01:52:59.526 --> 01:53:02.889]  And, you know, he was laughed at, joked about, it became a joke, McCarthyism.
[01:53:03.149 --> 01:53:04.330]  Well, it turned out he was right.
[01:53:04.631 --> 01:53:09.415]  There ended up being dozens, if not even hundreds, of communist inbeds inside the United States government.
[01:53:09.435 --> 01:53:10.035]  It all came out.
[01:53:10.476 --> 01:53:11.276]  But it's the same thing.
[01:53:12.136 --> 01:53:17.580]  So it's like here we are saying, hey look, we have globalist embeds in our government.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.201]  We have Chinese agents embedded in our government.
[01:53:20.261 --> 01:53:26.446]  Their goal is an anti-American propaganda machine via the media, via the U.S.
[01:53:26.486 --> 01:53:31.689]  government, so that whenever the time is right, they can come in and say, America shouldn't exist.
[01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.850]  Here's why.
[01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:36.772]  And the big here's why that they're going with is it was founded by white men.
[01:53:37.193 --> 01:53:38.554]  So so that's a good point.
[01:53:38.694 --> 01:53:41.696]  That's a good point to bring up how this isn't something spontaneous.
[01:53:42.277 --> 01:53:43.540]  This isn't something organic.
[01:53:44.061 --> 01:53:48.351]  This has all been manufactured over the course of decades, if not centuries.
[01:53:49.676 --> 01:53:51.037]  Yes, that's absolutely correct.
[01:53:51.077 --> 01:53:52.638]  You're 100% correct, Owen.
[01:53:53.039 --> 01:54:04.488]  And what we have to begin to do as like-minded people in the world is to create a critical mass of people who can see this thing and who can collaborate to oppose it.
[01:54:04.929 --> 01:54:17.519]  Because if we continue to make the mistake which we in South Africa have made far more extensively than you guys in the USA, but which you are making more now than we are, thank God, we've gotten over it a little bit.
[01:54:18.567 --> 01:54:27.775]  If we continue to make the mistake of believing that proselytizing and evangelizing and trying to draw people into our way of thinking is the answer, we're not going to get anywhere.
[01:54:28.215 --> 01:54:41.006]  If we try to convince people who, through the marrow of their bones, don't share this perception, we're going to spend all of our time out there trying to cultivate some giant flock of, you know, right wing.
[01:54:41.907 --> 01:54:43.068]  And it doesn't work that way.
[01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:44.950]  We, those of us,
[01:54:45.635 --> 01:54:57.788]  Who can see the problem for what it is must begin to put aside our differences and to focus on the commonalities between us and not the differences and to act in concert.
[01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:01.632]  Small though the critical mass may be.
[01:55:02.443 --> 01:55:04.724]  To act in concert now.
[01:55:05.224 --> 01:55:06.504]  And we will see a difference.
[01:55:06.544 --> 01:55:19.687]  We will see a far greater difference than if we spend the next 40 years hoping to persuade 30 or 40 or 50 percent or whatever percentage of the society to see this thing for what it is, because it will not happen.
[01:55:20.107 --> 01:55:26.469]  It's the viewers of the Alex Jones Show who are going to
[01:55:27.413 --> 01:55:31.997]  Make the change that is necessary, not the voters for Donald Trump.
[01:55:32.317 --> 01:55:51.072]  I hope I'm not offending too many people here, but people need to begin to recognize that you cannot achieve a drastic difference if you have a broad spectrum of people who are mostly half-hearted about the real severity of this crisis.
[01:55:51.152 --> 01:55:56.176]  Well, here's what I would say to that, because I think that you set this up perfectly.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:15.257]  Because South Africa has seen the violence and the hatred and the death and the gore of the cultural divide and the racial divide so extremely, people's eyes have finally been opened as an overall society to say, wow, I mean, why are these people being tortured to death?
[01:56:15.317 --> 01:56:16.659]  We're seeing these bloody bodies and everything.
[01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:19.100]  America hasn't really hit that point yet.
[01:56:20.762 --> 01:56:25.085]  There was a young white man that got kidnapped by some black people that were torturing him on social media.
[01:56:25.465 --> 01:56:27.386]  Okay, it's a young thing, stupid thing.
[01:56:27.707 --> 01:56:32.530]  You've got people dragging white people out of cars and beating them, saying, oh, you voted Trump, so they kick him in the street.
[01:56:33.271 --> 01:56:36.313]  But it's kind of like they kind of have a political veil over it.
[01:56:36.633 --> 01:56:38.635]  They won't say it's strictly based on race.
[01:56:39.375 --> 01:56:43.236]  And they have the excuse with the media saying, oh these are all racist white supremacist bigots.
[01:56:43.637 --> 01:56:51.740]  But it hasn't reached the level in South Africa where we're literally seeing hundreds of bloody dead bodies because of the racial war.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.061]  We haven't reached that point yet.
[01:56:54.101 --> 01:56:55.221]  We have to stop it from getting there.
[01:56:56.883 --> 01:56:57.684]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:57.704 --> 01:56:59.265]  You have to stop it from getting there.
[01:56:59.686 --> 01:57:12.178]  And my fear is that you guys are going to make the same mistake as we made in spending too much time trying to get everybody to see what we see and think what we see and believe what we see.
[01:57:12.739 --> 01:57:14.481]  And it just doesn't work well that way.
[01:57:14.501 --> 01:57:15.622]  You waste a lot of time.
[01:57:16.022 --> 01:57:19.446]  The people who can really see this thing in the USA,
[01:57:20.988 --> 01:57:23.230]  Are the people who should act now.
[01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:24.951]  And I'm not proposing what the action is.
[01:57:25.392 --> 01:57:30.696]  As you know, State Launders is the world's largest non-state civil defence organisation.
[01:57:31.016 --> 01:57:35.680]  We are legal and lawful and we've never had any case brought against us, much less successfully.
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.163]  So I'm not proposing anything radical or just stupid.
[01:57:39.583 --> 01:57:41.745]  I'm just saying that if you're going to do anything at all,
[01:57:42.751 --> 01:57:47.994]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[01:57:48.014 --> 01:57:49.035]  This is where everybody's going.
[01:58:11.599 --> 01:58:14.020]  This is what your body actually needs.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:25.944]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[01:58:26.564 --> 01:58:33.306]  Now obviously there's been a giant marijuana legalization craze that Soros has funded the last 10 years.
[01:58:33.907 --> 01:58:35.107]  I've not been involved in that.
[01:58:36.485 --> 01:58:37.245]  It's a huge bubble.
[01:58:37.585 --> 01:58:38.786]  This is not marijuana.
[01:58:38.886 --> 01:58:40.366]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[01:58:40.626 --> 01:58:50.289]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes but not the bad attributes that turn people into potheads in their basements picking and eating their boogers.
[01:58:51.249 --> 01:58:55.610]  This is the good CBD from the organic
[01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.130]  Yeah.
[01:59:16.986 --> 01:59:24.888]  There are different CBD rich hemp oil extractions for many, many, many different uses.
[01:59:25.388 --> 01:59:30.369]  You owe it to yourself to go look at this for yourself and to also understand it helps fund the hempful war.
[01:59:30.789 --> 01:59:32.370]  People wonder why I haven't gotten into CBD oil.
[01:59:32.850 --> 01:59:37.971]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[01:59:38.411 --> 01:59:39.292]  This is not that.
[01:59:39.692 --> 01:59:40.792]  Legal in all 50 states.
[01:59:41.152 --> 01:59:43.353]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[01:59:43.673 --> 01:59:44.873]  It's totally legal.
[01:59:45.743 --> 01:59:52.248]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[01:59:55.331 --> 02:00:01.256]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.498 --> 02:00:19.519]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:19.759 --> 02:00:22.720]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:26.141]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:41.867]  We have a video of an activist confronting Joe Biden, and this is the next level of citizen activism that needs to take place.
[02:00:44.648 --> 02:00:45.509]  Because, you know,
[02:00:48.188 --> 02:00:49.828]  I hate even saying it.
[02:00:51.069 --> 02:01:02.492]  The only reason why Sandy Cortez, Sandy Sweden, is able to get all of this unchecked popularity is because she doesn't do a debate with anybody.
[02:01:02.852 --> 02:01:07.913]  She's never had anyone really force her to back her ideas up and challenge them.
[02:01:09.293 --> 02:01:10.274]  All she gets is hype.
[02:01:11.434 --> 02:01:14.495]  So people need to confront Cortez.
[02:01:15.415 --> 02:01:15.755]  Say, hey.
[02:01:17.230 --> 02:01:18.091]  Why'd you change your name?
[02:01:19.112 --> 02:01:19.332]  Hey!
[02:01:20.553 --> 02:01:22.074]  Why do you want to bring socialism to America?
[02:01:22.094 --> 02:01:23.896]  If you like Sweden so much, why don't you move there?
[02:01:23.916 --> 02:01:25.797]  Do you know about all the terror attacks in Sweden?
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.664]  Like, this individual confronts Joe Biden like other people have confronted Joe Biden and others.
[02:01:34.445 --> 02:01:36.847]  Like, uh... I forget the guy's name.
[02:01:36.867 --> 02:01:39.990]  Was it Pizzagate Terry or something?
[02:01:41.687 --> 02:01:43.728]  He's done it like five times, he confronted these people.
[02:01:43.988 --> 02:01:56.694]  So here is Joe Biden being confronted by at the actually on Twitter for the dozens of YouTube videos where he's groping and caressing young children.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:20.385]  You know, if you saw Joe Biden at a park groping young women like that, what do you think would happen?
[02:02:33.217 --> 02:02:34.958]  You see all Joe Biden at the grocery store?
[02:02:36.119 --> 02:02:37.860]  Caressing young women like that?
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.361]  You think he'd get away with that?
[02:02:42.962 --> 02:02:43.143]  Hmm.
[02:02:45.864 --> 02:02:47.365]  He did it on C-SPAN and got away with it.
[02:02:49.266 --> 02:02:55.950]  So, shout out to at V actually on Twitter for confronting the creepy Joe Biden for groping all those young children.
[02:02:56.830 --> 02:03:02.294]  Now let's just show you the total disgust of Anna Navarro on CNN.
[02:03:03.214 --> 02:03:08.677]  This is an anti-American racist Democrat, Anna Navarro, on CNN.
[02:03:09.838 --> 02:03:18.920]  During a segment when they're talking about families murdered by illegal immigrants, she decides she's going to file her nails.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.861]  And to that point, yes there are.
[02:03:22.141 --> 02:03:24.181]  But even if I... That's fake news to say there are not.
[02:03:24.221 --> 02:03:24.742]  It's fake news.
[02:03:24.822 --> 02:03:28.702]  It's fake news for you to inject BS and say that it's equal to the real data.
[02:03:28.882 --> 02:03:29.283]  It's not BS.
[02:03:29.643 --> 02:03:35.164]  But even if I were to grant you that, okay, the point is the illegal alien crime rate
[02:03:35.524 --> 02:03:36.965]  Should be zero.
[02:03:37.145 --> 02:03:38.405]  It should be... You can do your nails.
[02:03:38.605 --> 02:03:39.686]  You know who can't do their nails?
[02:03:40.086 --> 02:03:50.751]  Are people who've been killed, Anna, by dangerous, known illegal aliens who've been allowed to stay in this country because of the leftist policies that people like you promote in so-called sanctuary cities.
[02:03:50.851 --> 02:03:52.952]  I'm so tired of you calling me leftist already.
[02:03:53.352 --> 02:03:55.353]  Just because you want to compromise your values.
[02:03:55.413 --> 02:03:56.534]  I don't care if you're tired of it.
[02:03:56.554 --> 02:03:57.754]  Go back to filing your nails.
[02:03:57.774 --> 02:03:58.875]  I don't care what you call me.
[02:03:58.915 --> 02:04:00.535]  To me, you're practically as irrelevant as Donald Trump Jr.
[02:04:00.795 --> 02:04:01.836]  Well, you should receive the care.
[02:04:02.336 --> 02:04:03.096]  I'll tell you what.
[02:04:30.333 --> 02:04:34.196]  It's not going to be long that we put up with this garbage much longer, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:37.978 --> 02:04:48.206]  And if the left in this country wants to keep banging at that door, they're going to get what they want.
[02:04:49.226 --> 02:04:50.147]  And it's not going to be pretty.
[02:04:51.688 --> 02:04:52.228]  We don't want it.
[02:04:52.288 --> 02:04:53.089]  We have restraint.
[02:04:53.609 --> 02:04:54.410]  We have tolerance.
[02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:58.333]  But I'm telling you, folks, it's waning.
[02:04:59.233 --> 02:04:59.654]  It's waning.
[02:05:03.686 --> 02:05:06.052]  No.
[02:05:07.717 --> 02:05:11.667]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:05:13.382 --> 02:05:16.404]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:05:16.524 --> 02:05:18.585]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:05:19.186 --> 02:05:23.008]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:05:23.488 --> 02:05:30.853]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:05:30.873 --> 02:05:33.415]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:05:36.838 --> 02:05:38.679]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:05:38.699 --> 02:05:39.739]  They called it U.N.
[02:05:39.759 --> 02:05:41.260]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.240]  2030 Agenda.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:53.204]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:05:55.345 --> 02:05:58.486]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:05:58.566 --> 02:05:59.266]  I mean, what?
[02:05:59.286 --> 02:06:00.607]  I mean, never!
[02:06:13.977 --> 02:06:14.678]  Big Brother.
[02:06:15.118 --> 02:06:16.338]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:16.919 --> 02:06:18.059]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:18.819 --> 02:06:20.240]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:21.661]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:22.161 --> 02:06:26.883]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.263 --> 02:06:30.265]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:30.285 --> 02:06:30.885]  I'll tell you what.
[02:06:32.156 --> 02:06:43.984]  My guest, Stuart Rhodes, is a great guest to have on because of his expertise on what's happening at the border, his experience down there, his group, Oath Keepers, which is doing everything they can to protect the border.
[02:06:44.825 --> 02:06:46.746]  And of course, you've got just breaking news coming out.
[02:06:46.786 --> 02:06:50.769]  President Trump's going to declare a national emergency probably before the end of the month.
[02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:54.632]  He has just decided to cancel his trip to Davos because of the government shutdown.
[02:06:54.652 --> 02:06:58.054]  So there's all this going on that Stuart Rhodes is a great guest to have on.
[02:06:58.074 --> 02:06:58.555]  But you know what?
[02:06:59.936 --> 02:07:01.657]  I actually want to go somewhere else with Stuart because
[02:07:02.549 --> 02:07:07.912]  I... Stewart is one of those gentlemen that he's already had enough.
[02:07:09.412 --> 02:07:11.173]  He's already had enough of the leftist scum.
[02:07:11.573 --> 02:07:13.434]  He's already had enough of the Democrat traitors.
[02:07:14.175 --> 02:07:15.595]  And so that's why he started Oath Keepers.
[02:07:15.615 --> 02:07:16.676]  That's why he takes action.
[02:07:16.736 --> 02:07:30.503]  Now, Stewart, I don't even know how to properly place myself on a map when it comes to anger and disgust dealing with these leftists right now, but
[02:07:31.595 --> 02:07:32.412]  I'm telling you, Stuart.
[02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:35.871]  We're going to reach a breaking point.
[02:07:36.392 --> 02:07:40.915]  We're going to reach a breaking point in American history before long.
[02:07:41.615 --> 02:07:44.497]  And conservatives, and just American patriots.
[02:07:44.617 --> 02:07:46.458]  You don't even have to put a political label on it.
[02:07:47.039 --> 02:07:54.023]  Just Americans that are sick of the lies, sick of the garbage, sick of the race baiting, just sick of all of it.
[02:07:54.063 --> 02:07:55.905]  We're going to reach a breaking point before long.
[02:07:56.325 --> 02:07:58.026]  And I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:07:59.067 --> 02:08:01.568]  I really don't even want to think and go down that road even.
[02:08:02.449 --> 02:08:03.550]  But Stuart, I'm telling you.
[02:08:04.530 --> 02:08:06.051]  The left is not gonna stop.
[02:08:06.131 --> 02:08:07.092]  I got a story today.
[02:08:07.532 --> 02:08:12.315]  They're now in the Huffington Post telling you how to teach your kids how to masturbate before the age of five.
[02:08:12.575 --> 02:08:15.657]  I mean, you really think you're gonna get away with this?
[02:08:16.377 --> 02:08:18.439]  So, so, I'm like... I mean...
[02:08:19.478 --> 02:08:27.543]  I'm just sitting here, just wait, like when, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, when do you think America is going to have enough of this garbage?
[02:08:27.563 --> 02:08:34.067]  Because I'm telling you, we are reaching a breaking point, and it is not far off, my friend.
[02:08:35.688 --> 02:08:36.609]  That's a good question.
[02:08:37.449 --> 02:08:39.671]  We are basically in a cold civil war.
[02:08:39.831 --> 02:08:46.435]  I don't think it's a good thing to see, and I think we need to work to try to avoid it, because a civil war would be brutal.
[02:08:48.837 --> 02:09:00.695]  If the left continues to dominate, the radical Marxist left continues to dominate the Democratic Party and they continue to push their agenda, which is a totalitarian agenda, eventually it's going to come to blows.
[02:09:01.456 --> 02:09:02.457]  And that's just reality.
[02:09:02.598 --> 02:09:03.239]  It always does.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.541]  Throughout history,
[02:09:05.217 --> 02:09:08.938]  Radical Marxists and totalitarians have never stopped until they're stopped.
[02:09:09.599 --> 02:09:11.079]  So, that's what's going to happen.
[02:09:11.559 --> 02:09:15.581]  And here's, again, this is just historically accurate, here's what's going to happen, Stuart.
[02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:17.801]  We're not going to be the first to shoot somebody.
[02:09:17.841 --> 02:09:19.462]  We're not going to be the first to punch somebody.
[02:09:19.482 --> 02:09:20.902]  In fact, the left has already done this.
[02:09:20.962 --> 02:09:23.343]  You had Hodgkinson shoot Steve Scalise.
[02:09:23.703 --> 02:09:29.305]  You have over 600 documented on-record cases of political terrorism against Trump supporters.
[02:09:29.325 --> 02:09:31.386]  So, the left is already engaging in the violence.
[02:09:31.686 --> 02:09:33.887]  The left is already engaging in trying to murder people.
[02:09:34.127 --> 02:09:35.048]  They're literally doing that.
[02:09:35.428 --> 02:09:44.934]  And then they ignore all of it and place all physical violence on one guy, James Fields, who, yeah, probably should be in jail for his life for involuntary manslaughter.
[02:09:45.535 --> 02:09:48.637]  But it was the left that caused that entire situation.
[02:09:48.837 --> 02:09:50.698]  They manufactured that entire event.
[02:09:51.018 --> 02:09:53.640]  And then they say, oh, look at conservatives, how violent they are.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.181]  They killed Heather Heyer.
[02:09:55.561 --> 02:09:58.803]  They have attempted to murder multiple conservatives.
[02:09:58.984 --> 02:10:00.244]  They shot Steve Scalise.
[02:10:00.465 --> 02:10:03.987]  Over 600 documented cases of political terrorism by leftists.
[02:10:04.447 --> 02:10:05.648]  So they don't understand.
[02:10:06.128 --> 02:10:10.191]  We're literally sitting here just taking you, trying to kill us.
[02:10:10.771 --> 02:10:12.252]  We're not going to sit here forever.
[02:10:12.493 --> 02:10:14.174]  We still have a survival instinct.
[02:10:14.394 --> 02:10:15.995]  It's just a matter of when it kicks in.
[02:10:17.776 --> 02:10:18.096]  Right.
[02:10:18.216 --> 02:10:20.658]  I mean, the right has not responded in kind.
[02:10:21.178 --> 02:10:22.940]  And I think that's actually a good strategy.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.383]  I think it's best for us to be restrained and take the high road, at least for now.
[02:10:27.583 --> 02:10:30.245]  But like you said, eventually it's going to go kinetic in the streets.
[02:10:30.405 --> 02:10:32.286]  And when that happens, it'll be a different ballgame.
[02:10:33.133 --> 02:10:36.656]  Antifa wearing black masks will only be a target indicator for rifles.
[02:10:37.736 --> 02:10:39.377]  But it's like, what do you do?
[02:10:39.397 --> 02:10:55.488]  It's like, I have all of these people today threatening me because I put out a tweet saying that the media drumming up all the anti-Trump hysteria is partly responsible for the death of Heather Heyer.
[02:10:55.768 --> 02:10:57.009]  I can factually back that up.
[02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:58.330]  I can logically back that up.
[02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:59.151]  Of course they are.
[02:10:59.311 --> 02:10:59.751]  They know it.
[02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:02.553]  That's why they want to place all the blame on James Fields.
[02:11:02.894 --> 02:11:06.357]  And so now all these people are threatening me, saying they want to come after me.
[02:11:06.737 --> 02:11:08.278]  So it's like, what?
[02:11:08.438 --> 02:11:09.539]  So that's what it is though, Stewart.
[02:11:09.859 --> 02:11:15.444]  They want us to sit here, to sit on our hands, and wait until they murder us.
[02:11:15.644 --> 02:11:16.164]  That's what it is.
[02:11:16.204 --> 02:11:19.367]  They want us to just sit here until they literally slit our throats.
[02:11:19.407 --> 02:11:21.228]  So it's like, we're in this zone.
[02:11:22.318 --> 02:11:34.619]  Where we're either just gonna sit here and say, okay, go ahead and slit my throat and kill us so the rest of the world can see who you are, a bunch of evil scumbags, or we defend our dignity and defend our life.
[02:11:34.719 --> 02:11:35.801]  I mean, that's where we're at right now.
[02:11:37.170 --> 02:11:47.036]  Right, well, the smart middle road is to be, you know, obviously prepared to defend yourself as you go about your day, but don't cross the line as he did, unfortunately, on that day.
[02:11:47.096 --> 02:11:47.857]  He crossed the line.
[02:11:48.157 --> 02:11:56.082]  First of all, he was a neo-Nazi scumbag, but like you said, he's the poster child now for supposedly, you know, this is the same conflation they do to all of us.
[02:11:56.702 --> 02:12:03.727]  That because of one action by one neo-Nazi scumbag, you know, that we're all neo-Nazis and this is what they want to put out there.
[02:12:03.747 --> 02:12:04.687]  This is what they want to believe.
[02:12:04.727 --> 02:12:08.289]  This is what they, their foot soldiers at Antifa want to believe also.
[02:12:08.890 --> 02:12:21.598]  And I think it was, I was sitting next to you not too long ago talking about this, how a lot of these kids are so brainwashed to believe that anyone who's not a Marxist, who's not on the political left, is automatically a fascist, automatically a racist.
[02:12:21.618 --> 02:12:23.039]  They're being conditioned to believe this.
[02:12:24.374 --> 02:12:28.056]  Unless we can deactivate that brainwashing, we're going to eventually have to fight them.
[02:12:28.696 --> 02:12:39.000]  But when we do, it'll be a different ballgame, because they don't have the military skills we do, they don't have the backgrounds we do, they don't have the life experiences we do, so they'll be, you know, behind the curve on actual combat.
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:41.121]  They don't have the humanity that we have.
[02:12:41.221 --> 02:12:46.403]  I mean, if you really want to get down to the foundation of just survival instincts,
[02:12:48.363 --> 02:12:57.072]  I won't go down that road, but when they came out with the decision that James Fields is going to be charged for murder, anybody who watched The War Room remembers how upset I got that day.
[02:12:57.092 --> 02:12:59.595]  And again, I'm not sitting here trying to defend James Fields.
[02:12:59.935 --> 02:13:01.417]  If I was the judge, it would be my opinion.
[02:13:01.537 --> 02:13:04.260]  I think he's in jail for involuntary manslaughter, whatever the case is.
[02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:07.063]  The point is, they manufacture the whole thing.
[02:13:07.563 --> 02:13:15.748]  Place all the blame on James Fields to now, like you said, say, look, all Trump supporters are neo-Nazis and they murdered Heather Heyer, which is just not the case at all.
[02:13:15.788 --> 02:13:17.289]  I mean, I knew that this would happen.
[02:13:17.369 --> 02:13:18.689]  I knew this moment would happen.
[02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:20.190]  And now it's actually happening.
[02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:23.492]  And I just want to defend myself to say, hey, look, we're not neo-Nazis.
[02:13:24.013 --> 02:13:26.154]  There is a situation in Charlottesville that was bad.
[02:13:26.334 --> 02:13:27.715]  There's multiple people to blame.
[02:13:27.895 --> 02:13:31.677]  The whole thing was created and manufactured by the mainstream media.
[02:13:31.877 --> 02:13:33.238]  Here's my logic to prove it.
[02:13:33.778 --> 02:13:34.759]  And then they just say, oh,
[02:13:35.299 --> 02:13:36.400]  Well, you're just scum.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:37.420]  You're just a neo-Nazi.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:40.782]  And then I say, well, why don't you call into the show and debate me on this?
[02:13:40.882 --> 02:13:41.682]  And then they never will.
[02:13:42.302 --> 02:13:48.325]  I mean, so how do we beat the brainwashing, Stuart, when they won't even engage in a political discussion or discussion of any kind?
[02:13:49.225 --> 02:13:52.547]  I think you have to let other groups like the walk-away movement do that for you.
[02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:57.952]  But as I've said before, we have to make sure that we don't fall for identity politics either.
[02:13:58.453 --> 02:14:04.277]  It's a mistake to try to fight fire with fire by becoming racist yourself or identifying along racial lines.
[02:14:04.297 --> 02:14:05.217]  That's what they want you to do.
[02:14:05.838 --> 02:14:07.519]  They want to divide and conquer the American people.
[02:14:07.539 --> 02:14:17.226]  I mean, the big picture is, is the globalists pulling the strings want black Americans to hate white Americans and vice versa, and Hispanic Americans to hate, you know, they want us all to hate each other along racial lines.
[02:14:17.846 --> 02:14:19.666]  And the worst thing we can do is fall for it.
[02:14:19.686 --> 02:14:21.447]  So I think the walkaway movement is a good indicator.
[02:14:21.927 --> 02:14:26.328]  A lot of the black conservatives who are now speaking up and supporting Trump is a good indicator.
[02:14:26.768 --> 02:14:28.028]  All of this is what we need to support.
[02:14:28.928 --> 02:14:39.831]  What we don't need to do, though, is jump all the way to the far right and say, yes, because the left is becoming identity politics, racial focused, we should also, too.
[02:14:39.851 --> 02:14:41.251]  I think it's a huge mistake.
[02:14:42.628 --> 02:14:45.270]  All right, well, let's get into some of this border news.
[02:14:45.871 --> 02:14:55.639]  Of course, you're not doing that, you know, and neither am I. No, I know, but you're just saying it's just important to lay that out because that's what they claim, you know, that's the claim they try to pin on us when it's none of it's true.
[02:14:55.679 --> 02:14:57.440]  They never provide a quote, you know.
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.861]  That's what loves Richard Spencer.
[02:14:58.881 --> 02:15:04.006]  They love their poster boy on the far right who's, you know, a name in the Constitution as much as they are.
[02:15:04.546 --> 02:15:06.187]  This was so bizarre about Charlottesville.
[02:15:06.207 --> 02:15:15.852]  You had two different groups of violent enemies of the Constitution who hate the Constitution attacking each other, which was kind of hilarious, frankly, until someone was killed.
[02:15:16.472 --> 02:15:24.896]  And then the whole thing gets spun out of context to blame Trump supporters and used as evidence that were, you know, Nazis murderers.
[02:15:25.616 --> 02:15:27.877]  Yeah, which, you know, we weren't there for that reason.
[02:15:27.917 --> 02:15:33.480]  We knew there was going to be a Nazi fest full of, like I said, they're domestic enemies of the Constitution as bad as any communist.
[02:15:37.407 --> 02:15:40.229]  This country is in such dire straits, and it always will be.
[02:15:40.269 --> 02:15:42.131]  That's the price of freedom, is eternal vigilance.
[02:15:42.171 --> 02:15:50.938]  I mean, you know, so... But let's talk about how, because let's bring it back to the border, because really, you can apply that to everything.
[02:15:51.138 --> 02:15:53.020]  These people don't even want to have a border, folks.
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:56.403]  They don't even want to stop drugs and crime and rapists from coming into this country.
[02:15:56.423 --> 02:15:57.223]  That's just a fact.
[02:15:58.024 --> 02:15:59.025]  What's wrong with these people?
[02:15:59.085 --> 02:16:00.046]  Who are these people?
[02:16:02.674 --> 02:16:06.596]  The last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[02:16:07.576 --> 02:16:13.479]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[02:16:13.959 --> 02:16:23.364]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[02:16:23.884 --> 02:16:25.085]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[02:16:25.645 --> 02:16:27.946]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[02:16:28.526 --> 02:16:40.974]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes.
[02:16:41.054 --> 02:16:44.817]  Everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[02:16:44.857 --> 02:16:53.843]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[02:16:54.643 --> 02:16:55.183]  But now,
[02:16:56.181 --> 02:17:14.542]  They have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[02:17:15.303 --> 02:17:17.545]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[02:17:18.526 --> 02:17:22.888]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom, they're patriots.
[02:17:23.308 --> 02:17:43.297]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you, you drop ship it, you get it out, you have the website, I promote it, I send people there, and that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[02:17:43.997 --> 02:17:47.439]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[02:17:48.544 --> 02:17:58.194]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[02:17:58.954 --> 02:18:03.679]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[02:18:03.979 --> 02:18:12.068]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[02:18:13.274 --> 02:18:23.323]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[02:18:23.663 --> 02:18:25.505]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[02:18:25.545 --> 02:18:26.125]  I've researched it.
[02:18:26.145 --> 02:18:31.630]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[02:18:31.650 --> 02:18:33.051]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[02:18:33.852 --> 02:18:45.787]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[02:18:47.074 --> 02:18:54.939]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:11.851]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all, because they have more than 40 products.
[02:19:12.211 --> 02:19:14.973]  Now, remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[02:19:15.173 --> 02:19:16.174]  They've tried to shut us down.
[02:19:16.954 --> 02:19:18.155]  They've tried to boycott us.
[02:19:18.175 --> 02:19:18.976]  They've tried to sue us.
[02:19:19.476 --> 02:19:25.981]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[02:19:26.201 --> 02:19:33.967]  We're still going to do that with Infowarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[02:19:34.047 --> 02:19:35.889]  And this is the first big one.
[02:19:36.249 --> 02:19:37.110]  So I'm very excited.
[02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:37.910]  Be sure and go there.
[02:19:37.971 --> 02:19:46.237]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the highest quality, the
[02:19:46.237 --> 02:19:53.344]  The lowest prices, it's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at WashingtonReserve.com, and you're helping fund the info war the whole time.
[02:20:05.856 --> 02:20:08.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:38.957 --> 02:20:40.438]  Listen to the beauty of Ray Charles.
[02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:44.841]  This song makes me cry.
[02:20:48.843 --> 02:20:51.284]  Here's the analogy of the American left right now.
[02:20:53.383 --> 02:21:06.107]  It's the younger sibling at the dinner table, sitting across from you at the dinner table, kicking your shins under the table, throwing food across the table at you, trying to initiate a reaction.
[02:21:06.327 --> 02:21:09.727]  And then, of course, denying it, you know, to the parent sitting at the dinner table.
[02:21:09.767 --> 02:21:15.169]  So, you know, they want to kick you, throw food at you, do anything they can to try to initiate a reaction out of you.
[02:21:16.089 --> 02:21:21.891]  And then as soon as you react, they point the finger at you and blame you for everything so that you get shut down.
[02:21:22.891 --> 02:21:26.513]  That's the American left right now in the United States of America.
[02:21:26.653 --> 02:21:36.058]  A petulant child, a petulant antagonist that will disappear as soon as it's time to take roll call for responsibility.
[02:21:37.018 --> 02:21:40.620]  And here's my issue, because I'm sorry to focus on this Stuart, but here's my thing.
[02:21:41.601 --> 02:21:46.083]  I am like, I am locked in on the American left right now.
[02:21:46.183 --> 02:21:47.684]  I mean, I am like,
[02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:52.958]  Locked in, cannot unlock myself until the target is destroyed.
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:56.564]  But the problem is, I don't know the weapon to destroy these people.
[02:21:57.335 --> 02:21:58.336]  They don't like facts.
[02:21:58.636 --> 02:21:59.657]  They don't like logic.
[02:21:59.797 --> 02:22:00.957]  They have no common sense.
[02:22:01.138 --> 02:22:02.078]  They don't know history.
[02:22:02.238 --> 02:22:03.099]  They have no intellect.
[02:22:03.319 --> 02:22:07.382]  And they won't come on air to actually debate this or discuss this.
[02:22:07.802 --> 02:22:12.345]  So, like, I'm in this perpetual state of frustration, Stuart, where I'm locked in on the enemy.
[02:22:12.445 --> 02:22:13.546]  I have them identified.
[02:22:13.646 --> 02:22:14.567]  I have them targeted.
[02:22:14.787 --> 02:22:17.108]  They must be destroyed or they will destroy America.
[02:22:17.448 --> 02:22:21.411]  But there is... I don't know how to beat the brainwashing.
[02:22:21.531 --> 02:22:23.633]  I don't know how to wake them out of their trance.
[02:22:23.753 --> 02:22:25.774]  I don't know how to get them to wake up.
[02:22:25.994 --> 02:22:27.115]  And I don't think they want to.
[02:22:27.715 --> 02:22:32.338]  So I'm sorry to stay on this, Stuart, and it's just, I don't know what to do.
[02:22:32.398 --> 02:22:35.360]  I'm so frustrated with these people because I know where this goes.
[02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:39.803]  In 10, 20, 30 years, America will be gone.
[02:22:40.023 --> 02:22:42.785]  You will not have the freedom to build a business.
[02:22:42.825 --> 02:22:45.007]  You will not have the freedom to speak your mind.
[02:22:45.247 --> 02:22:46.848]  You will have nothing.
[02:22:47.348 --> 02:22:48.529]  And they brag about it.
[02:22:48.709 --> 02:22:50.851]  They brag about how they want to bring communism here.
[02:22:51.211 --> 02:22:52.052]  So it's like, how?
[02:22:52.112 --> 02:22:53.032]  I mean, Stuart, I'm sorry.
[02:22:53.072 --> 02:22:56.875]  Again, I'm sorry to dwell on this, and if you want to switch roads, just go ahead and do it.
[02:22:58.115 --> 02:23:07.160]  I just want to know, what is the weapon, what is the weapon to destroy this ideology that the left is trying to bring to America?
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:08.901]  I just, I can't, I'm so frustrated.
[02:23:08.961 --> 02:23:09.861]  I'm so locked in.
[02:23:10.121 --> 02:23:11.042]  I've identified these people.
[02:23:11.062 --> 02:23:11.982]  I know everything they do.
[02:23:12.142 --> 02:23:13.083]  I know all their moves.
[02:23:13.263 --> 02:23:14.163]  I know how they think.
[02:23:14.424 --> 02:23:16.184]  That's how I can defeat them in a debate so easily.
[02:23:16.205 --> 02:23:18.045]  I just don't know what to do.
[02:23:18.186 --> 02:23:19.346]  Is love the weapon of the future?
[02:23:19.366 --> 02:23:20.707]  No, these people don't even understand love.
[02:23:20.727 --> 02:23:21.207]  That's another thing.
[02:23:21.227 --> 02:23:23.008]  They don't even speak the language of love, Stuart.
[02:23:24.119 --> 02:23:25.400]  Well, I think it still is the answer though.
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:28.701]  And I think truth, both truth and love are the answer.
[02:23:29.481 --> 02:23:33.123]  I think the walk away movement is a key indicator of how you do it.
[02:23:33.563 --> 02:23:36.384]  We have to always keep in mind there's a big difference between the leadership
[02:23:36.977 --> 02:23:37.117]  Yeah.
[02:24:00.013 --> 02:24:00.334]  We're good
[02:24:21.135 --> 02:24:22.116]  You're right, and they hate me.
[02:24:51.655 --> 02:24:56.058]  But you know what, here's the thing, because what you said is key, and let's bring this to the situation at the border.
[02:24:56.358 --> 02:24:59.781]  President Trump, in his address the other night, said what?
[02:25:00.701 --> 02:25:04.964]  Building a wall is not because you hate the people on the other side of the wall.
[02:25:04.984 --> 02:25:07.506]  Well, maybe if you're Nancy Pelosi or Barack Obama, it probably is.
[02:25:08.026 --> 02:25:17.352]  But building a wall at the border, you know, putting a wall at your home, locking your doors at night, that's not because you hate people on the outside, it's because you love people on the inside.
[02:25:18.032 --> 02:25:18.333]  Stewart!
[02:25:19.313 --> 02:25:21.795]  I don't think these people understand the language of love.
[02:25:21.935 --> 02:25:23.556]  I don't think they understand the language of truth.
[02:25:23.656 --> 02:25:25.638]  I don't think they understand the language of facts or logic.
[02:25:25.998 --> 02:25:27.619]  So how do I even communicate with that?
[02:25:27.879 --> 02:25:28.700]  How do I communicate with them?
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:29.801]  I mean, I think that you're right.
[02:25:29.861 --> 02:25:31.442]  I think President Trump went with that message.
[02:25:31.462 --> 02:25:33.884]  He said, we love people inside America.
[02:25:34.184 --> 02:25:36.426]  We want to protect them by building a wall.
[02:25:36.446 --> 02:25:38.487]  I think Trump is trying to use the message of love.
[02:25:38.507 --> 02:25:40.829]  I just, I just don't think it's working.
[02:25:42.182 --> 02:25:45.444]  Well, like I said, you have to do it from the inside out.
[02:25:45.504 --> 02:25:49.287]  You can't do it by going there and doing it in a confrontational way.
[02:25:50.428 --> 02:25:51.708]  It's a long, hard slog.
[02:25:51.748 --> 02:25:56.111]  You've got to be on the campuses, you've got to be in the public forums, and you've got to be the voice of reason.
[02:25:56.151 --> 02:25:58.933]  I think Jordan Peterson is a very good example of how you do it.
[02:25:58.953 --> 02:26:03.476]  You keep your cool, you state facts, and you let the facts speak for themselves.
[02:26:03.516 --> 02:26:05.898]  And over time, eventually they come around.
[02:26:06.598 --> 02:26:07.499]  That's what you have to hope for.
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:09.521]  If they're willing to listen.
[02:26:09.841 --> 02:26:11.241]  But that's the problem, right?
[02:26:11.301 --> 02:26:13.763]  A lot of them are so brainwashed that they just will not listen.
[02:26:14.263 --> 02:26:17.524]  But I think the walkaway movement, once again, is a good example.
[02:26:17.644 --> 02:26:18.885]  I think it's the best strategy.
[02:26:18.905 --> 02:26:25.828]  And, you know, I hate to say it, but you have to put your minority, racial minority people out there.
[02:26:25.848 --> 02:26:29.870]  You've got to have your black conservatives and libertarians go and speak about liberty to the blacks.
[02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:31.771]  You've got to have the Hispanic ones do it for the Hispanics.
[02:26:32.151 --> 02:26:36.233]  That's the only way to counter the identity politics racism on the left.
[02:26:36.852 --> 02:26:37.112]  Yeah.
[02:26:38.133 --> 02:26:39.954]  But what's the demarcation line?
[02:26:39.994 --> 02:26:41.435]  How do we know we're having success?
[02:26:41.455 --> 02:26:44.217]  I mean, the walkaway movement happened before the midterm elections.
[02:26:44.557 --> 02:26:46.118]  The Democrats still won the House.
[02:26:46.578 --> 02:26:48.679]  That's because they stole 16 seats.
[02:26:48.739 --> 02:26:50.360]  But this is what's going on.
[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:51.181]  I mean, what do we do?
[02:26:51.921 --> 02:26:52.582]  It takes time.
[02:26:52.602 --> 02:26:54.403]  I mean, they did the long march.
[02:26:54.563 --> 02:26:56.864]  They did the long march through our institutions, as they called it.
[02:26:57.264 --> 02:26:58.005]  The communists did.
[02:26:58.025 --> 02:26:59.786]  They took over higher learning.
[02:26:59.826 --> 02:27:01.327]  We're asleep at the switch, frankly.
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:02.801]  And we let them do it.
[02:27:03.221 --> 02:27:04.982]  And so we have to countervail that.
[02:27:05.022 --> 02:27:06.403]  We should be on the college campuses.
[02:27:06.503 --> 02:27:14.528]  I mean, I've been wanting to get on college campuses for a couple years now, but a lot of my members are so, you know, they're older people and they just don't feel comfortable being on a college campus.
[02:27:14.548 --> 02:27:18.811]  But until conservatives get rid of that fear of going out there... Well, I've got no fear.
[02:27:18.831 --> 02:27:20.151]  I'd be glad to go to a college campus.
[02:27:20.171 --> 02:27:22.553]  Stuart, what is going on at OathKeepers.org right now?
[02:27:23.809 --> 02:27:34.371]  Well, we're still on the border, but as I said before, it's discouraging to see the Border Patrol being instructed to catch and release into the same old nonsense of the trumped-up
[02:27:35.131 --> 02:27:35.872]  Amnesty claims.
[02:27:35.992 --> 02:27:40.336]  And I think what has to happen is the president must do the right thing and put the troops on the border.
[02:27:40.356 --> 02:27:43.540]  I think he's making a mistake, though, in doing it the way he's doing it.
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:54.271]  I understand what he's trying to do politically, but by saying I'm going to do an emergency declaration if they don't give me the funding, he's actually putting himself in the legally weakest position.
[02:27:54.771 --> 02:28:04.360]  Because then they can say in the courts, well, Congress denied him the funding, Congress said no to a wall, and he tried to do it through executive order, through declaration of emergency.
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:05.862]  It puts him in a weaker position.
[02:28:05.882 --> 02:28:11.387]  He'll have to argue that he has an independent power as commander-in-chief to build the wall, even if Congress says no.
[02:28:11.827 --> 02:28:21.960]  What he should have done is as soon as that police officer in California was killed by an illegal alien gangbanger who's part of the cartel network, he should have declared the emergency and said it's nothing to do with my fight with Congress.
[02:28:22.341 --> 02:28:23.542]  If they want to give me funding, great.
[02:28:23.562 --> 02:28:25.685]  If they don't, that's, you know, we'll battle that out.
[02:28:25.825 --> 02:28:27.267]  So would you agree with my analysis?
[02:28:27.327 --> 02:28:28.669]  Trump has to go full bore.
[02:28:28.729 --> 02:28:29.590]  There's no other option.
[02:28:30.521 --> 02:28:31.121]  Absolutely.
[02:28:31.141 --> 02:28:33.322]  I mean, he should have done that day one of his inauguration.
[02:28:33.342 --> 02:28:37.625]  He should have, from the stage, as soon as he was sworn in, he should have said, I am declaring an emergency.
[02:28:37.645 --> 02:28:38.745]  We have an emergency on our border.
[02:28:38.765 --> 02:28:39.666]  I'm going to deploy the troops.
[02:28:39.726 --> 02:28:41.386]  And he should have done it every day ever since then.
[02:28:41.827 --> 02:28:44.688]  He's way behind the power ball, behind the power curve on this.
[02:28:45.589 --> 02:28:58.195]  But I do think, you know, you look back at Youngstown's Cheating Tube, the Supreme Court decision about Truman trying to nationalize steel mills is where you'll see the position he's going to be in if he just makes this a political fight only.
[02:28:58.951 --> 02:29:01.172]  Alright, Stuart Rhodes, OathKeepers.org.
[02:29:01.472 --> 02:29:02.013]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:06.855 --> 02:29:18.401]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars and yours truly for selling high quality supplements.
[02:29:20.037 --> 02:29:38.524]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[02:29:40.165 --> 02:29:42.206]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[02:29:42.586 --> 02:29:43.466]  Whole Foods was number two.
[02:29:44.307 --> 02:29:49.609]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[02:29:51.192 --> 02:29:57.478]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[02:29:58.759 --> 02:30:12.433]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at Infowarslife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[02:30:13.354 --> 02:30:15.396]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[02:30:16.326 --> 02:30:19.212]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[02:30:19.392 --> 02:30:20.013]  No response.
[02:30:20.234 --> 02:30:21.196]  They never want to get my comment.
[02:30:21.737 --> 02:30:22.659]  Now, why am I saying that?
[02:30:23.721 --> 02:30:24.322]  It's simple.
[02:30:25.353 --> 02:30:29.897]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[02:30:30.297 --> 02:30:35.602]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[02:30:36.242 --> 02:30:37.483]  So we have a great product.
[02:30:37.603 --> 02:30:38.004]  You love it.
[02:30:38.084 --> 02:30:38.704]  You reorder it.
[02:30:39.085 --> 02:30:41.346]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[02:30:41.807 --> 02:30:43.728]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[02:30:43.889 --> 02:30:44.930]  It's a 360 win.
[02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.950]  We defeat them.
[02:30:46.050 --> 02:30:46.431]  You win.
[02:30:46.551 --> 02:30:46.891]  I win.
[02:30:47.191 --> 02:30:47.692]  It's amazing.
[02:30:49.545 --> 02:30:54.327]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWorksStore.com and InfoWorksLife.com.
[02:30:54.387 --> 02:31:09.973]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[02:31:11.892 --> 02:31:12.412]  It's hard to believe.
[02:31:12.492 --> 02:31:15.214]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[02:31:15.294 --> 02:31:22.799]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[02:31:23.639 --> 02:31:25.901]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[02:31:25.921 --> 02:31:35.426]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[02:31:35.526 --> 02:31:36.227]  But just know this.
[02:31:38.243 --> 02:31:46.368]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[02:31:46.688 --> 02:31:48.909]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[02:31:49.629 --> 02:31:59.955]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[02:32:00.795 --> 02:32:01.876]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[02:32:01.976 --> 02:32:02.616]  I'm garbage.
[02:32:03.657 --> 02:32:05.298]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[02:32:05.498 --> 02:32:06.799]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:09.353]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[02:32:09.974 --> 02:32:11.077]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[02:32:11.858 --> 02:32:13.502]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[02:32:14.665 --> 02:32:16.328]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[02:32:16.408 --> 02:32:17.110]  It's all dynamite.
[02:32:18.663 --> 02:32:22.525]  They can tell you how great it is, and show you all the facts, and tell you, because they're the elite.
[02:32:22.865 --> 02:32:23.585]  I'm just scum.
[02:32:24.205 --> 02:32:25.126]  Just like you, according to them.
[02:32:25.166 --> 02:32:27.587]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[02:32:27.947 --> 02:32:32.129]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[02:32:32.609 --> 02:32:37.691]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience super male vitality, super female vitality.
[02:32:37.871 --> 02:32:47.996]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, super male vitality, super female, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[02:32:48.536 --> 02:32:49.477]  Because it's so frustrating.
[02:32:49.497 --> 02:32:52.679]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[02:32:52.839 --> 02:32:57.702]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullworthstore.com and mfullworthslife.com.
[02:32:57.902 --> 02:32:58.802]  Thanks for your support.
[02:33:06.907 --> 02:33:09.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.495 --> 02:33:29.024]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.504 --> 02:33:32.869]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:32.889 --> 02:33:40.038]  Alright, I'm gonna try to get outside of my own head here for the last 30 minutes before Doug Hagman takes over.
[02:33:41.192 --> 02:33:47.396]  And then I'm going to re-energize and just go full savage against the left on The War Room today from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:33:47.436 --> 02:33:47.776]  Central.
[02:33:48.517 --> 02:33:49.818]  And I'm opening up the phone lines.
[02:33:50.138 --> 02:33:58.143]  I'm just going to do the whole broadcast because I have hundreds of leftists attacking me on Twitter right now, including writers at The Washington Post and BuzzFeed and Huffington Post and all this stuff.
[02:33:58.644 --> 02:33:59.704]  And I've asked them to come on air.
[02:33:59.724 --> 02:34:00.045]  They won't.
[02:34:00.065 --> 02:34:01.125]  They're all cowards and frauds.
[02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:05.648]  But we'll go ahead and give them an opportunity because they all want to talk trash on Twitter.
[02:34:05.668 --> 02:34:09.271]  Let's see if they'll do it, you know, in the actual conversation.
[02:34:09.331 --> 02:34:09.811]  No, they won't.
[02:34:09.851 --> 02:34:10.592]  They're cowards and frauds.
[02:34:12.312 --> 02:34:17.674]  Here's the good news, and then I'm going to get outside of my own head and just try to cover some of this news.
[02:34:18.935 --> 02:34:25.158]  The energy of Earth is directly connected to human consciousness.
[02:34:27.219 --> 02:34:38.784]  So anybody who knows about the metaphysics and the frequencies of our own reality, basically there's ebbs and flows of energy.
[02:34:39.952 --> 02:34:53.840]  So, Tuesday night, when President Trump gave his address from the Oval Office, even though we were frustrated because it wasn't as hardcore as it should have been, that was one form of energy blasting out into the universe that was devastating to the ideologies of the left.
[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:54.280]  Why?
[02:34:55.221 --> 02:34:59.083]  President Trump gave up cold, hard facts about what's happening at the border.
[02:34:59.583 --> 02:35:07.088]  He did it in a very measured and loving fashion that was undeniable and resonated with the average American that isn't totally brainwashed.
[02:35:07.788 --> 02:35:14.475]  Then Chuck and Nancy came out and gave their rebuttal address, which was a total devastation of optics, to themselves.
[02:35:15.256 --> 02:35:24.325]  So that was a push of energy against a form of thought and consciousness in the West.
[02:35:25.326 --> 02:35:28.449]  Right now, it's flowing back in the opposite direction.
[02:35:28.949 --> 02:35:30.471]  And that's why I'm so frustrated today.
[02:35:31.633 --> 02:35:33.294]  That's why I'm getting attacked so much.
[02:35:33.754 --> 02:35:37.716]  That's why Huffington Post is telling you to teach your kids how to masturbate before the age of five.
[02:35:38.037 --> 02:35:40.278]  That's why they're lying about what's happening at the border.
[02:35:40.298 --> 02:35:41.518]  That's why they're lying about Trump.
[02:35:41.558 --> 02:35:56.727]  And then the biggest one, that's why they're pushing Sandy Sweden, formerly Alexandra Cortez, as the biggest, baddest thing right now in the United States because she is the answer to the failing Democrat Party.
[02:35:57.107 --> 02:35:58.328]  The Democrat Party's dead.
[02:35:59.574 --> 02:36:01.857]  Cortez is the answer to that corpse.
[02:36:02.197 --> 02:36:03.278]  And it's going to be socialism.
[02:36:03.699 --> 02:36:04.660]  That's why they're building her up.
[02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:07.023]  And I've identified their entire playbook.
[02:36:07.664 --> 02:36:11.008]  And I may get to it today, here on the Jones Show or the War Room, but folks...
[02:36:12.156 --> 02:36:14.778]  I can predict every single move they make with Cortez.
[02:36:15.098 --> 02:36:22.762]  She has been controlled, whether she knows it or not, from the very get-go by Bernie Sanders backers.
[02:36:23.082 --> 02:36:29.946]  And that's on record with disclosures from old websites run by Bernie Sanders people that they then gave to Cortez.
[02:36:31.627 --> 02:36:33.188]  So, there's all of that going on.
[02:36:33.808 --> 02:36:34.689]  But the good news is...
[02:36:35.598 --> 02:36:43.402]  That means by the weekend, or perhaps over the weekend, there's going to be a major push of energy against these people.
[02:36:43.743 --> 02:36:54.348]  So something big is definitely going to happen in the next 48 hours as far as just the consciousness of the West is concerned and the flows of positive and negative energy.
[02:36:54.408 --> 02:36:55.749]  But let me get outside of my head.
[02:36:56.790 --> 02:37:01.052]  I've got some news and I have plugged once today, all broadcast.
[02:37:02.898 --> 02:37:07.183]  I think there's probably ten people that work on the Alex Jones Show here every day.
[02:37:08.665 --> 02:37:20.140]  And there's, you know, five more people that work on the War Room and five more people that work on the David Knight Show, and then there's a whole graphics department, and then there's the whole shipping department, the marketing department, and great editors, and camera people, and crew people.
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:32.453]  And I wish more people would actually come into the studio to see what InfoWars is all about, because people come into the studio, they see the 50 people that work here every day, and they're stunned at what Alex Jones has created.
[02:37:32.493 --> 02:37:34.095]  But it's what you've created.
[02:37:35.136 --> 02:37:38.339]  It's what you've built at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:39.100]  And it's amazing.
[02:37:40.171 --> 02:37:47.678]  Because InfoWare Store continues to grow with different products, household items like toothpaste and toothbrushes and shampoo and body wash.
[02:37:48.098 --> 02:37:54.083]  Then you've got emergency food supplies, you've got air filters, you've got water filters, you've got hats and t-shirts that are so popular.
[02:37:55.495 --> 02:38:14.520]  The supplements are really the game changers at Infowarsstore.com because there isn't really a place you can go and get just a slew of different supplements that are just so highly rated with official reviews that also funds the weapon against globalism, that funds the weapon against
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:20.585]  The Communist Socialist Destruction of America Agenda here in the West.

[02:39:19.346 --> 02:39:19.726]  I'll tell you what.
[02:39:21.727 --> 02:39:27.069]  Let me go, well... Let me just do a News Blitz.
[02:39:28.624 --> 02:39:30.585]  Mexico finds 20 bodies.
[02:39:30.605 --> 02:39:31.285]  It's from Reuters.
[02:39:31.465 --> 02:39:35.687]  Mexico finds 20 bodies, 17 of them burned at the U.S.
[02:39:35.867 --> 02:39:36.187]  border.
[02:39:37.348 --> 02:39:40.129]  The left says there's nothing to see here.
[02:39:41.170 --> 02:39:43.371]  Texas landowners prepare wall fight.
[02:39:43.571 --> 02:39:44.611]  Trump to visit border.
[02:39:44.851 --> 02:39:46.652]  I actually know the answer to this.
[02:39:46.732 --> 02:39:47.853]  So here's what the AP did.
[02:39:47.873 --> 02:39:50.694]  They found some landowners down at the southern border that are anti-wall.
[02:39:50.714 --> 02:39:51.254]  And that's fine.
[02:39:51.274 --> 02:39:54.836]  They don't want a wall on their land and, you know, eminent domain and everything.
[02:39:55.296 --> 02:39:55.836]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:39:55.856 --> 02:39:57.117]  They want the wall on their land.
[02:39:58.223 --> 02:39:59.024]  This is what can happen.
[02:39:59.484 --> 02:40:07.310]  So you have Jim Acosta go out at a portion of the border today that had a wall, and he's like, I'm down here at the border, and there's no national emergency, everything's fine!
[02:40:07.330 --> 02:40:10.732]  And it's like, yeah, Jim, because you're at the wall.
[02:40:11.793 --> 02:40:14.155]  Go to the segment where there isn't a wall, Jim!
[02:40:14.715 --> 02:40:16.396]  But he's too big of a coward and a fraud to do that.
[02:40:16.437 --> 02:40:18.638]  So Jim actually proves Trump is right.
[02:40:18.658 --> 02:40:23.722]  Jim Acosta proves Trump is right today by going to a section of the border that has a wall and says there's no national emergency here.
[02:40:24.022 --> 02:40:26.164]  Yeah, because there's a wall, you jackass!
[02:40:30.816 --> 02:40:31.737]  But here's what Trump can do.
[02:40:32.177 --> 02:40:38.224]  Trump should actually give in on these landowners that don't want a wall on their land.
[02:40:38.444 --> 02:40:39.025]  Here's what you do.
[02:40:39.045 --> 02:40:45.772]  I'm telling you, this is the 40, 50, 60 chest how you defeat these people's ideology.
[02:40:46.923 --> 02:40:47.703]  Build the wall.
[02:40:47.823 --> 02:40:50.244]  First of all, build the wall across the whole southern border.
[02:40:51.224 --> 02:40:55.826]  And then the landowners that don't want the wall in their land, you say, OK, fine, you won't get the wall.
[02:40:56.406 --> 02:41:01.188]  Guess where all of the illegal immigrant trafficking is going to start happening, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:41:02.188 --> 02:41:05.290]  It's going to happen on the landowners that refused the wall.
[02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:10.072]  And guess who's going to make the biggest fuss about that when it happens?
[02:41:10.412 --> 02:41:13.133]  The very landowners that rejected the wall.
[02:41:13.714 --> 02:41:24.199]  So once that situation plays itself out, they just teed the ball up for Trump to say, see, I told you so, in triplicate, and that's exactly what will happen.
[02:41:25.339 --> 02:41:26.400]  But first, you have to get the wall.
[02:41:28.109 --> 02:41:30.950]  And Trump is going to declare a national emergency to do so.
[02:41:31.050 --> 02:41:33.150]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:41:33.171 --> 02:41:44.074]  From Washington Times, number of sick kids, sores at border, tuberculosis, flu infections, land migrants in hospitals.
[02:41:44.094 --> 02:41:45.094]  And then we pay for it.
[02:41:46.955 --> 02:41:47.975]  The disease spreads.
[02:41:49.008 --> 02:41:52.229]  You've got outbreak of TB in the United States in the last three years.
[02:41:52.249 --> 02:41:59.032]  In fact, I wonder if there's a line graph of that that could show how much it's really just skyrocketed, TB.
[02:41:59.052 --> 02:42:03.214]  And that's, you know, 100% because of the wide open borders, TB's coming from Central America.
[02:42:04.814 --> 02:42:10.897]  From Breitbart, Jorge Ramos, border wall symbol of hate and racism for those who want to make America white again.
[02:42:10.957 --> 02:42:16.079]  So there's your propaganda coming from the anti-American globalists again, coming from the anti-white racists again.
[02:42:17.566 --> 02:42:20.248]  No, Mexico has a wall on its southern border.
[02:42:20.268 --> 02:42:27.772]  That's what I'm saying, like, how does this guy... I can't even, I just... Jorge Ramos knows Mexico has a wall on the southern border.
[02:42:27.993 --> 02:42:33.836]  Jorge Ramos probably has a wall, you know, blocking his million-dollar mansion from the peons of society.
[02:42:34.577 --> 02:42:36.298]  So why is he such a lying fraud?
[02:42:38.988 --> 02:42:40.168]  Yeah, there's tuberculosis.
[02:42:40.188 --> 02:42:44.649]  I don't know what this is really saying here, guys, because I can't see the full thing.
[02:42:45.270 --> 02:42:46.870]  I'm not sure if this is proving me right or wrong.
[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:53.352]  Uh... Okay, so, yeah, so foreign-born tuberculosis cases have skyrocketed since 1993.
[02:42:53.452 --> 02:42:55.732]  Is that what that represents right there?
[02:42:56.372 --> 02:42:57.253]  Yeah, big surprise.
[02:42:57.653 --> 02:42:59.813]  So, so, so... Whatever.
[02:42:59.833 --> 02:43:00.453]  Just kill America.
[02:43:00.493 --> 02:43:00.814]  It's fine.
[02:43:00.834 --> 02:43:01.074]  Screw it.
[02:43:02.694 --> 02:43:04.274]  You know that guy Alex Jones?
[02:43:04.915 --> 02:43:06.055]  The Infowars guy?
[02:43:06.974 --> 02:43:07.915]  You know who I'm talking about?
[02:43:08.275 --> 02:43:10.676]  The guy with no lips, that f***ing lunatic.
[02:43:11.036 --> 02:43:16.319]  They removed all his content from Facebook, iTunes, Pinterest, and YouTube.
[02:43:16.700 --> 02:43:17.420]  Good, you f***er.
[02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:19.641]  You know the piece of s*** I'm talking about, right?
[02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:20.742]  Alex Jones.
[02:43:21.102 --> 02:43:22.803]  You know which piece of s*** I'm talking about?
[02:43:22.983 --> 02:43:24.224]  Alex f***ing Jones.
[02:43:24.644 --> 02:43:25.224]  You know, right?
[02:43:25.485 --> 02:43:27.486]  They shut you down, you f***er.
[02:43:28.066 --> 02:43:28.366]  Good.
[02:43:28.646 --> 02:43:30.908]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of s***.
[02:43:31.688 --> 02:43:33.389]  Good, you f***ing lunatic!
[02:43:33.890 --> 02:43:34.210]  Good!
[02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:35.791]  Bye-bye, f*** off!
[02:43:35.851 --> 02:43:40.254]  Tech companies are taking the lead in suppressing any voices that dissent against the left.
[02:43:40.334 --> 02:43:45.777]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across Western Europe.
[02:43:46.017 --> 02:43:48.319]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[02:43:48.339 --> 02:43:52.581]  I have a right to face my accusers, Jack, and I never threatened the media with battle rifles.
[02:43:52.641 --> 02:43:54.803]  All the top searchers are lies about me and my family.
[02:43:54.863 --> 02:43:59.886]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[02:44:00.026 --> 02:44:01.427]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[02:44:01.708 --> 02:44:02.969]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[02:44:03.409 --> 02:44:05.811]  And you, Congressman Deutsch, are a liar and a fraud.
[02:44:05.891 --> 02:44:11.036]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[02:44:11.136 --> 02:44:12.237]  Google is evil!
[02:44:12.657 --> 02:44:13.698]  Google is evil!
[02:44:13.738 --> 02:44:15.300]  We're aware of his lying to Congress.
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:19.684]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project that's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[02:44:19.984 --> 02:44:21.445]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[02:44:21.465 --> 02:44:26.190]  There is an absolute all-out war on conservative free speech.
[02:44:30.649 --> 02:44:35.733]  Facebook and Twitter are under fire as conservative users are speaking out about being censored on their platforms.
[02:44:35.813 --> 02:44:38.836]  Alex Jones was banned by every major social network.
[02:44:38.896 --> 02:44:45.881]  In the past few days, Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and other companies have all banned Alex Jones from using their platforms.
[02:44:45.921 --> 02:44:47.903]  He's been shadow banned by Google.
[02:44:48.043 --> 02:44:50.145]  Milo Yiannopoulos was banned by Twitter.
[02:44:50.165 --> 02:44:53.607]  I don't know if you know about this, but Milo Yiannopoulos, you know who he is?
[02:44:53.667 --> 02:44:56.990]  He got banned from Twitter for writing a bad review about Ghostbusters.
[02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:58.911]  This guy is a threat to the Republic.
[02:44:58.991 --> 02:45:07.473]  British anti-Islamization activist Tommy Robinson has had his Twitter account suspended again after he tweeted that Islam promotes killing.
[02:45:07.593 --> 02:45:10.594]  Also, Twitter purged various libertarian accounts.
[02:45:11.055 --> 02:45:13.415]  Instagram temporarily banned Tommy Robinson.
[02:45:13.795 --> 02:45:17.857]  Facebook took down a GOP candidate's ads for allegedly being offensive.
[02:45:17.937 --> 02:45:21.858]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:45:21.958 --> 02:45:23.799]  They're coming for everyone's speech.
[02:45:23.939 --> 02:45:24.439]  It's criminal.
[02:45:24.639 --> 02:45:30.961]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked, and canceled on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.
[02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:33.022]  Facebook censored our free speech.
[02:45:33.262 --> 02:45:37.744]  Twitter this evening has suspended the account of Gavin McInnes.
[02:45:38.004 --> 02:45:42.626]  And shame on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[02:45:42.686 --> 02:45:45.827]  You are caught on tape by Project Veritas shadowbanning people.
[02:45:46.327 --> 02:45:47.368]  You are censoring people.
[02:45:47.408 --> 02:45:48.128]  You censored me.
[02:45:48.168 --> 02:45:49.229]  You censored my love.
[02:45:49.249 --> 02:45:51.510]  You censored Chuck Johnson, James O'Keefe.
[02:45:51.530 --> 02:45:55.733]  You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for a few minutes.
[02:45:55.773 --> 02:45:57.174]  You are censoring conservatives.
[02:45:57.234 --> 02:45:59.675]  And I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[02:45:59.715 --> 02:46:02.777]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late.
[02:46:02.877 --> 02:46:04.878]  Facebook is censoring free speech.
[02:46:04.938 --> 02:46:06.639]  They're making and changing the rules.
[02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:08.200]  Reverend Graham was banned for over 24 hours.
[02:46:09.141 --> 02:46:15.427]  I had this platform, and that was my main platform for communicating with people and sending out my content, and now I can't communicate.
[02:46:15.487 --> 02:46:16.367]  I've been silenced.
[02:46:16.407 --> 02:46:23.374]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives.
[02:46:23.474 --> 02:46:29.299]  Authorities in Britain now seem more interested in fighting hate speech on the internet than fighting crime.
[02:46:29.839 --> 02:46:34.041]  They're warning social media users that their comments are being monitored.
[02:46:34.141 --> 02:46:42.545]  I'm more upset that some people in Silicon Valley, in secret, determined which ideas are allowed on my social media feed.
[02:46:42.585 --> 02:46:51.709]  And so we just sit here and just endure the greatest censorship in the history of America, and the left, which claims to be for free speech, applauds it.
[02:46:51.869 --> 02:46:58.592]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of sh... If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:06.246 --> 02:47:08.869]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.733 --> 02:47:26.476]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:47:26.536 --> 02:47:29.759]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:30.019 --> 02:47:32.981]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:47:33.561 --> 02:47:39.806]  I'm gonna do my best to remain calm and collected while I read this story from the Huffington Post.
[02:47:41.994 --> 02:47:47.099]  Why kids need to know that masturbation is normal and okay.
[02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:50.483]  Now, the crew just handed me a bunch of other stuff.
[02:47:50.563 --> 02:48:00.132]  Cartoons, Planned Parenthood puts out a book, The Wonder Books of Masturbation Techniques that feature kids, you know, doing the deed.
[02:48:01.714 --> 02:48:03.075]  Just all kinds of sick stuff.
[02:48:03.255 --> 02:48:05.137]  And so there's all kinds of stuff already out there.
[02:48:06.789 --> 02:48:13.151]  But let's focus on this article, and the crew's gonna pull up other stories with Democrat top staffers getting arrested for child porn.
[02:48:13.791 --> 02:48:18.093]  You got all these pizza managers kidnapping kids, getting arrested for child porn.
[02:48:18.473 --> 02:48:27.956]  Of course, you have the WikiLeaks talking about having young children in the hot tub for your entertainment, the pizza-related handkerchiefs, the maps, the dominoes on pizza, all the pedophile code language.
[02:48:29.117 --> 02:48:32.218]  But let's just go to this article from the Huffington Post today, and I read directly.
[02:48:33.675 --> 02:48:37.478]  Masturbation is a really important part of human sexuality.
[02:48:37.958 --> 02:48:46.904]  It informs our individual conceptions of autonomy, pleasure, identity, and intimacy, said sex educator teacher Kim Cavall on the Huffington Post.
[02:48:47.444 --> 02:48:51.447]  Trying to discourage, shame, or eliminate it does young people a tremendous disservice.
[02:48:51.827 --> 02:49:03.235]  Instead of seeing it as a problem to solve, think of it as an opportunity to teach skills and concepts that empower young people to grow into sexually healthy adults.
[02:49:03.775 --> 02:49:07.298]  I mean, do I even have to get into the hyperbole of that statement?
[02:49:08.499 --> 02:49:13.042]  An opportunity to teach sex skills and concepts to children?
[02:49:14.203 --> 02:49:17.706]  And that's going to make them sexually healthy adults?
[02:49:19.767 --> 02:49:20.308]  I go on.
[02:49:21.008 --> 02:49:27.774]  Sex educator Lydia M. Bauer said, we should also be talking about pleasure in non-sexual ways.
[02:49:29.153 --> 02:49:30.915]  I like how the wind feels on my face.
[02:49:31.216 --> 02:49:32.998]  The color purple makes me feel happy.
[02:49:33.559 --> 02:49:38.165]  So children develop both language and the knowledge that feeling good isn't something to be ashamed of.
[02:49:38.445 --> 02:49:44.613]  So they're now comparing masturbation or sexual pleasure to the wind going through your hair.
[02:49:46.021 --> 02:49:54.089]  Cavill recommended talking to children about self-touching before the onset of puberty, which typically starts at 9 to 16 years old.
[02:49:54.569 --> 02:50:02.537]  For many parents, the conversation arises much earlier on because their children start to explore their bodies at a very young age.
[02:50:02.897 --> 02:50:04.479]  Do you see how sick this is?
[02:50:06.561 --> 02:50:09.244]  Children exploring their bodies?
[02:50:12.182 --> 02:50:16.566]  Teach your children about self-touching before puberty?
[02:50:18.889 --> 02:50:19.609]  These are sick people.
[02:50:21.251 --> 02:50:21.631]  I go on.
[02:50:22.753 --> 02:50:31.541]  Though we associate masturbation most commonly with teenagers, infantile masturbation is also very common for children between the ages of 1 to 5.
[02:50:31.581 --> 02:50:31.802]  What?
[02:50:36.573 --> 02:50:42.195]  Many small children touch their genitals as a form of self-soothing, much like thumb-sucking.
[02:50:43.036 --> 02:50:47.578]  Cavill said, masturbation at any age is not dirty, shameful, or illicit.
[02:50:47.878 --> 02:50:51.259]  In fact, it's a perfectly normal and healthy behavior for people to engage in.
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:52.620]  This is so sick!
[02:50:53.701 --> 02:50:58.503]  So, a child touches themselves, and you call it masturbation?
[02:50:58.923 --> 02:51:00.684]  You're a sick freak.
[02:51:01.204 --> 02:51:02.264]  You're a sexual deviant.
[02:51:02.484 --> 02:51:03.585]  You're probably a pedophile.
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:06.561]  Like, I can't even believe this.
[02:51:08.884 --> 02:51:10.385]  Like, do I really have to lay this out for you?
[02:51:11.086 --> 02:51:22.318]  People don't masturbate... I mean, like... People masturbate for sexual pleasure, and here is these sex experts in Huffington Post saying, oh no, it's normal for your kid to masturbate.
[02:51:22.338 --> 02:51:22.979]  Let him masturbate.
[02:51:22.999 --> 02:51:24.440]  In fact, teach him how to masturbate.
[02:51:25.201 --> 02:51:25.462]  What?! !
[02:51:27.625 --> 02:51:31.028]  And the crew's just pulling up all these leftist videos, Huffington Post, other crap.
[02:51:31.248 --> 02:51:32.929]  Yeah, they just want to sexualize your kids.
[02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:35.852]  Devin the Amazing, they take them to gay clubs, they throw money at them.
[02:51:36.292 --> 02:51:37.113]  You know, you know what?
[02:51:37.133 --> 02:51:38.134]  I'm not even gonna say it, folks.
[02:51:38.614 --> 02:51:46.761]  In fact, you wouldn't even believe what's actually going on behind the scenes with Devin the Amazing.
[02:51:47.562 --> 02:51:49.583]  You wouldn't even believe it.
[02:51:50.184 --> 02:51:54.788]  And I'm not gonna talk about it right now, but you will learn.
[02:51:56.072 --> 02:51:58.673]  Very shortly, what's really behind it?
[02:51:58.813 --> 02:52:02.594]  And it's, it's sicker than you could ever imagine.
[02:52:04.014 --> 02:52:09.335]  I go on from the Huffington Post that tells you to teach your children how to masturbate before the age of five and says it's normal.
[02:52:10.136 --> 02:52:12.376]  Masturbation at, oh, I'm sorry, I already read that.
[02:52:12.676 --> 02:52:13.076]  Excuse me.
[02:52:13.616 --> 02:52:23.619]  It's crucial for parents and caregivers to normalize masturbation by talking about it in a shame-free way, particularly if their child has already started exploring self-touch.
[02:52:27.048 --> 02:52:35.937]  Disgust, scolding, and rejection do not help children learn lessons, and in fact, can grow into internalized shame and self-loathing later in life.
[02:52:36.477 --> 02:52:36.958]  Yeah!
[02:52:37.358 --> 02:52:38.079]  Good!
[02:52:38.339 --> 02:52:40.562]  You should feel shame when you masturbate!
[02:52:40.802 --> 02:52:43.625]  You should feel shame when you watch porn to masturbate!
[02:52:44.325 --> 02:52:44.846]  Duh!
[02:52:46.447 --> 02:52:48.690]  Like, I mean, that's the whole thing!
[02:52:50.128 --> 02:52:53.871]  But they want to erase that from your children.
[02:52:54.431 --> 02:52:57.193]  They want your children to just think it's, oh, I'll just watch porn, masturbate.
[02:52:57.313 --> 02:52:59.555]  Oh, yeah, teach your kid how to touch themselves at age one.
[02:52:59.835 --> 02:53:03.978]  This is all sexual deviancy, sickness.
[02:53:05.679 --> 02:53:08.141]  Say, oh, don't feel bad for watching porn and masturbating.
[02:53:08.461 --> 02:53:09.202]  It's normal.
[02:53:10.923 --> 02:53:11.844]  It's not healthy.
[02:53:11.864 --> 02:53:14.646]  And there's a reason why you feel that shame.
[02:53:17.981 --> 02:53:23.364]  After parents have communicated that self-touch is normal and natural, they can establish that it's also private.
[02:53:23.845 --> 02:53:29.248]  This is particularly important for young children who may rub against objects like pillows, furniture, or toys.
[02:53:29.268 --> 02:53:33.830]  I'm vomiting!
[02:53:34.331 --> 02:53:41.875]  They're literally sitting here sexualizing children, getting off on how children rub themselves against toys and furniture.
[02:53:41.915 --> 02:53:43.096]  This is sick!
[02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:54.583]  Teaching privacy sounds like this.
[02:53:55.143 --> 02:53:59.245]  I'm so glad you're enjoying your body by touching your penis, vulva, anus.
[02:53:59.725 --> 02:54:04.247]  That's usually something people do in private or in a safe space other people can't see.
[02:54:04.727 --> 02:54:10.770]  Then offer to take the child to their nearest private space and say, here's a private space for you to touch your penis, vulva, anus.
[02:54:11.230 --> 02:54:12.991]  You can be private in here anytime you want.
[02:54:13.171 --> 02:54:15.412]  Folks, I'm just reading from the Huffington Post article.
[02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:17.140]  That's all I'm doing.
[02:54:19.341 --> 02:54:23.362]  Now let me bring it home, because here's the real conclusion that they want reached.
[02:54:24.903 --> 02:54:28.524]  Parents sometimes worry that masturbation may be a sign of sexual abuse.
[02:54:29.044 --> 02:54:33.645]  Unless there are other concerns or red flags involved, it is often not a cause.
[02:54:35.486 --> 02:54:38.167]  Here is what this article has just told people.
[02:54:40.347 --> 02:54:41.408]  Children are masturbating.
[02:54:43.088 --> 02:54:43.768]  It's a good thing.
[02:54:44.529 --> 02:54:45.389]  You should let them do it.
[02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:50.974]  And you should begin teaching them about how to masturbate at the age of one.
[02:54:53.876 --> 02:54:56.398]  Now this is all in the Huffington Post article.
[02:54:58.539 --> 02:54:59.920]  But what is this actually doing?
[02:55:01.061 --> 02:55:10.408]  This is creating a excuse, really, or it's creating an out, it's creating a scenario
[02:55:11.647 --> 02:55:17.011]  Where pedophiles are going to get away with sexually abusing their children.
[02:55:17.751 --> 02:55:21.894]  And they're just going to say, oh, I was just teaching them how to masturbate.
[02:55:22.215 --> 02:55:23.315]  It's a good thing.
[02:55:23.335 --> 02:55:26.398]  I mean, read the article for yourself.
[02:55:26.498 --> 02:55:27.238]  I just read it for you.
[02:55:27.739 --> 02:55:29.040]  Teach your kids how to masturbate.
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:29.720]  Here's the videos.
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:30.561]  This is shocking.
[02:55:30.781 --> 02:55:34.183]  The crew, I just told the crew, I was like, hey, pull up any stories, videos.
[02:55:34.443 --> 02:55:35.024]  There's videos.
[02:55:35.044 --> 02:55:37.606]  They're showing kids how to jack off a dildo.
[02:55:40.444 --> 02:55:41.365]  Let me tell you something!
[02:55:41.946 --> 02:55:42.887]  Let me tell you something!
[02:55:43.707 --> 02:55:55.179]  In a society that has any common sense, in a society that has any men left in it, anybody pushing the sexualization of children would get a nice hello.
[02:55:55.199 --> 02:55:59.924]  But no!
[02:56:00.284 --> 02:56:00.744]  Not here!
[02:56:01.932 --> 02:56:13.162]  It's considered normal to teach your infant how to masturbate and now the Huffington Post tells you and others, The Cut, this is all over the place, Salon, teach your infant how to masturbate.
[02:56:13.662 --> 02:56:20.248]  It's all a grooming process to bring pedophilia into the world and normalize it.
[02:56:20.968 --> 02:56:21.808]  So it starts here.
[02:56:22.609 --> 02:56:24.990]  Oh, pedophile, that's just a sexual preference.
[02:56:25.470 --> 02:56:28.331]  Oh, that kid dressed as drag, that's liberal, that's loving.
[02:56:28.351 --> 02:56:30.653]  We're taking him to gay clubs because we're tolerant liberals.
[02:56:30.853 --> 02:56:31.373]  Oh, yeah.
[02:56:32.053 --> 02:56:32.253]  Mm-hmm.
[02:56:32.593 --> 02:56:33.674]  There's something else behind that.
[02:56:34.594 --> 02:56:43.999]  But now they say, oh, teach your kid how to masturbate, take your kid to a private area and show them how to jack off and everything and touch their anus.
[02:56:44.359 --> 02:56:46.580]  Again, this is from the Huffington Post.
[02:56:48.211 --> 02:56:49.432]  And so then, what happens?
[02:56:49.672 --> 02:56:54.415]  Some pedophile, they just arrested a foster care parent, turned out to be a pedophile.
[02:56:54.555 --> 02:56:56.276]  I'm not trying to demonize foster care, that just happened.
[02:56:56.917 --> 02:57:07.403]  But now, some pedophile will come up, and they'll get caught in the bathroom, jacking off an infant, and they'll say, oh, I was just teaching them how to masturbate.
[02:57:08.184 --> 02:57:15.849]  No, you're a pedophile, you're a sexual deviant, using the left's excuses that they gave you to get away with it.
[02:57:17.045 --> 02:57:21.530]  So you better understand where this goes right here and right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:22.231 --> 02:57:25.854]  They are normalizing pedophilia, and this is how they're doing it.
[02:57:26.015 --> 02:57:28.878]  They're telling you it's okay to go teach your kid how to jack off.
[02:57:29.038 --> 02:57:35.124]  They're telling you it's okay to dress your kid up in drag, show them how to do fentanyl, and go to the clubs and dance for dollars!
[02:57:35.905 --> 02:57:37.967]  Where is America?
[02:57:38.267 --> 02:57:44.793]  Where are the men and women in this country that want to protect children from sexual deviance?
[02:57:45.414 --> 02:57:50.418]  No, it's not okay to show an infant how to ejaculate and masturbate themselves.
[02:57:50.438 --> 02:57:51.099]  You are sick!
[02:57:55.700 --> 02:57:57.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[02:57:58.183 --> 02:58:13.300]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products at InfluenceLife.com and saying, what do I need to take religiously, that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:14.521]  And it's these three babies.
[02:58:15.362 --> 02:58:19.144]  It's Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid.
[02:58:19.244 --> 02:58:20.285]  Nobody else can top that.
[02:58:20.665 --> 02:58:21.726]  Top of the line in the nation.
[02:58:22.446 --> 02:58:28.269]  It's X3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together, including the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[02:58:28.770 --> 02:58:34.253]  Because some people can't absorb that type, we put a little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of Vitamin C to stabilize it.
[02:58:34.513 --> 02:58:37.194]  And then Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:58:37.615 --> 02:58:41.537]  Super Male Vitality's been our overall most successful product.
[02:58:41.917 --> 02:58:44.518]  Neck and neck with Brain Force Plus.
[02:58:45.179 --> 02:58:51.361]  But because it's wildcrafted and a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[02:58:52.282 --> 02:58:56.724]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[02:58:57.164 --> 02:58:59.025]  But it's been very, very hard to do.
[02:58:59.065 --> 02:59:01.626]  So we're not discontinuing it because it's crap.
[02:59:01.726 --> 02:59:03.987]  We're discontinuing it because we can't get it.
[02:59:04.067 --> 02:59:07.969]  It may come back in the future, but right now we're just not able to bring you this.
[02:59:08.029 --> 02:59:09.050]  It's our last run of it.
[02:59:09.750 --> 02:59:10.371]  Proprietary.
[02:59:10.711 --> 02:59:11.132]  Amazing.
[02:59:11.412 --> 02:59:12.794]  It's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:13.194 --> 02:59:16.918]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.

[02:59:18.580 --> 02:59:19.101]  Bodies.
[02:59:19.701 --> 02:59:21.223]  Turmeric formula.
[02:59:21.503 --> 02:59:23.866]  And it's supercharged with other key ingredients.
[02:59:24.867 --> 02:59:25.448]  Supercharge it.
[02:59:25.468 --> 02:59:26.228]  Bring it to the next level.
[02:59:26.969 --> 02:59:28.350]  And then, of course, it's the X3.
[02:59:28.370 --> 02:59:31.293]  It's our final run of X2.
[02:59:31.313 --> 02:59:42.943]  We've secured the Deep Earth Iodine, but I thought we'd make a better one with all three types in the bottom of C. But, so get your X2, get your X3, all at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:59:43.203 --> 02:59:47.987]  And again, have a great New Year as we fight the globalists and restore the Republic and freedom to the planet.
[02:59:48.127 --> 02:59:48.588]  Thank you all.
[02:59:56.852 --> 03:00:03.033]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:14.796 --> 03:00:21.297]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:34.203]  As a nation, we have reached a state of cultural subversion, where full-blown treason has become the norm.
[03:00:34.343 --> 03:00:36.424]  People love you, and you win.
[03:00:36.684 --> 03:00:41.165]  And when your son looks at you and says, Mama, look, you won, bullies don't win.
[03:00:41.265 --> 03:00:42.526]  And I said, baby, they don't.
[03:00:42.806 --> 03:00:44.887]  Because we're going to go in there, we're going to impeach some other...
[03:00:45.646 --> 03:00:55.192]  Judicial Watch has been sounding that alarm for some time now, exposing the fact that your tax dollars are supporting your own demise.
[03:00:55.492 --> 03:01:07.480]  George Soros' Open Society Foundation's efforts to subvert the populism and anti-globalism sweeping the United States with Marxist division and unyielding self-loathing
[03:01:07.780 --> 03:01:10.925]  Should ring alarm bells from sea to shining sea.
[03:01:11.165 --> 03:01:24.763]  Judicial Watch stated Soros with the help of American taxpayer dollars bolsters a radical left-wing agenda that in the United States has included promoting an open border with Mexico and fighting immigration enforcement efforts.
[03:01:25.023 --> 03:01:30.346]  Fomenting racial disharmony by funding anti-capitalist racialist organizations.
[03:01:30.506 --> 03:01:36.648]  Financing the Black Lives Matter movement and other organizations involved in the riots in Ferguson, Missouri.
[03:01:36.809 --> 03:01:40.390]  Weakening the integrity of our electoral systems.
[03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:43.612]  Promoting taxpayer-funded abortion on demand.
[03:01:43.872 --> 03:01:46.433]  Advocating a government-run healthcare system.
[03:01:46.613 --> 03:01:47.613]  Opposing U.S.
[03:01:47.674 --> 03:02:00.079]  counterterrorism efforts, promoting dubious transnational climate change agreements that threaten American sovereignty, and working to advance gun control and erode Second Amendment protections.
[03:02:00.259 --> 03:02:05.701]  Soros moved last year about $18 billion of his personal wealth into Open Society Foundation.
[03:02:06.242 --> 03:02:08.963]  That funds their overhead and their overall operations.
[03:02:09.784 --> 03:02:14.371]  But Open Society Foundation and all of its affiliates and subsidiaries is very smart.
[03:02:14.911 --> 03:02:16.634]  They know how to pick the lock on the U.S.
[03:02:16.674 --> 03:02:17.155]  Treasury.
[03:02:17.655 --> 03:02:25.506]  And so they go to the State Department, they go to USAID, and they apply for grants and funding for programs, activities,
[03:02:26.563 --> 03:02:30.144]  Now, as I said, George Soros is a billionaire.
[03:02:30.205 --> 03:02:30.725]  His groups
[03:02:53.869 --> 03:02:58.794]  Don't need tax dollars to do their work advancing their left-wing agenda, don't you think?
[03:03:00.055 --> 03:03:12.808]  And we're also exposing that USAID and State Department are funding these far-left groups to undermine the non-progressive
[03:03:14.989 --> 03:03:18.411]  Or non-liberal or non-socialist policies of governments abroad.
[03:03:19.091 --> 03:03:23.353]  Add to Soros' blatant subversion that of the Washington Post.
[03:03:23.513 --> 03:03:41.743]  The Jeff Bezos-run paper has had to distance itself from the Khashoggi-Qatari propaganda debacle, only to step in its own pile of disinformation yet again, as the Conservative Review reported less than two months after he was given prominent op-ed space in the Washington Post.
[03:03:42.003 --> 03:03:53.248]  A video has surfaced of Houthi rebel leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi launching a shoulder-fired missile and then reciting the Houthi slogan, which calls for death to America.
[03:03:53.389 --> 03:04:00.512]  Whether it's the forced acceptance of pedophilia or the domination of our political landscape by foreign interests,
[03:04:00.652 --> 03:04:05.556]  The moral and rational code of the United States is taking a severe beating.
[03:04:05.757 --> 03:04:22.171]  We have no other choice but to prosecute and reject this invasion of intended mental illness spearheaded by enemies of our republic like George Soros, or find ourselves morphing into the madness as our nation enters the point of no return.
[03:04:22.472 --> 03:04:23.793]  John Bowne reporting.
[03:04:38.991 --> 03:04:43.118]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:04:43.859 --> 03:04:45.301]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:03.981]  The globalists know.
[03:05:04.181 --> 03:05:05.341]  Defeat the globalists.
[03:05:05.842 --> 03:05:07.002]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:08.623]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[03:05:09.084 --> 03:05:10.184]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:11.125 --> 03:05:15.367]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:16.008 --> 03:05:19.230]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:27.875]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:28.815 --> 03:05:31.236]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[03:05:31.617 --> 03:05:38.180]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:05:38.881 --> 03:05:42.763]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:05:42.823 --> 03:05:48.726]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:05:48.786 --> 03:05:51.607]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:05:51.807 --> 03:05:53.048]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:53.308 --> 03:05:56.370]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:06:00.302 --> 03:06:07.065]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.125 --> 03:06:08.985]  And now, your host, Doug Hagman.
[03:06:23.957 --> 03:06:27.478]  And welcome to this edition of InfoWars, InfoWars.com.
[03:06:27.498 --> 03:06:30.579]  Doug Hagman, Joe Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:06:31.099 --> 03:06:32.920]  And of course, we've got so much to cover.
[03:06:33.060 --> 03:06:37.761]  As usual, it's never a slow news day, that's to be sure.
[03:06:38.161 --> 03:06:45.603]  You know, everyone's talking about, well, we've got about five or six different battlefronts, I suppose, we as patriots.
[03:06:45.683 --> 03:06:50.765]  The patriots here in the United States are under assault, we're under attack constantly.
[03:06:52.011 --> 03:07:01.895]  Donald Trump, of course, is the only stopgap between the globalists, the agenda of the globalists, and the American people, and we thank him for that.
[03:07:02.536 --> 03:07:09.999]  And as we look back over the time here that we've seen, here since Donald Trump was elected into office,
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:17.666]  We're looking at day number 721 of the Donald J. Trump presidency today.
[03:07:17.686 --> 03:07:17.926]  Date 721.
[03:07:18.106 --> 03:07:23.971]  721 days in office, and I would say, based on the entirety of the accomplishments, that you'll never hear about the mainstream media.
[03:07:24.611 --> 03:07:30.276]  He has accomplished more in those 721 days, and specifically in the first 500 days than any other president in America.
[03:07:30.296 --> 03:07:31.637]  Let's never forget that.
[03:07:32.372 --> 03:07:33.433]  There will be detractors.
[03:07:33.673 --> 03:07:37.355]  There will be people who are saying, look, he's selling out.
[03:07:37.555 --> 03:07:38.596]  Well, that's not true.
[03:07:38.916 --> 03:07:41.217]  And if you believe that, you're believing a lie.
[03:07:41.818 --> 03:07:49.643]  This is also day number 604 for those keeping track at home of the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller.
[03:07:49.963 --> 03:07:58.188]  Compliments of a recused Jeff Sessions from the Attorney General's office, as well as Rod Rosenstein and, of course, Comey.
[03:07:58.828 --> 03:08:01.390]  So kind of putting things in perspective.
[03:08:02.173 --> 03:08:06.535]  Looking back, during his campaign in the first 500 days, what did he run on?
[03:08:06.575 --> 03:08:09.557]  Of course, he ran on strong borders, strong economy.
[03:08:09.577 --> 03:08:14.820]  Hey, look at the economy, look at the economic numbers, the economic growth, tremendous.
[03:08:15.440 --> 03:08:27.126]  Yet, there is a fight taking place, obviously, and part of that fight involves the Fed, involves interest rate hikes, involves the issues that, of course, would take
[03:08:28.082 --> 03:08:31.845]  Uh, Donald Trump's, uh, President Trump, that is.
[03:08:31.865 --> 03:08:33.726]  His wins, and of course, um...
[03:08:35.247 --> 03:08:35.807]  I think so.
[03:08:59.443 --> 03:09:10.448]  Now, among the battlefronts that we the people face, and among the battlefronts that President Trump is fighting on our behalf, he's the Commander-in-Chief, our Commander-in-Chief.
[03:09:10.868 --> 03:09:15.210]  Among things he's doing, of course, he's calling out the Democratic Socialists on the border.
[03:09:15.971 --> 03:09:20.513]  You've heard Owen and others talk about the border situation.
[03:09:22.133 --> 03:09:25.035]  Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes, great friend of the show.
[03:09:25.095 --> 03:09:30.298]  By the way, for those who don't know me or my son, we have a show.
[03:09:30.378 --> 03:09:31.718]  It's called the Hagman Report.
[03:09:31.899 --> 03:09:33.800]  We broadcast live 7 to 10 weeknights.
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:36.781]  Our home base is HagmanReport.com.
[03:09:36.821 --> 03:09:39.503]  That's Hagman, two N's, HagmanReport.com.
[03:09:39.543 --> 03:09:41.784]  And we thank you for tuning in.
[03:09:42.504 --> 03:09:46.606]  And of course, go to HagmanReport.com for all of the information about us.
[03:09:46.646 --> 03:09:47.687]  But having said all of that,
[03:09:48.431 --> 03:09:59.634]  One thing that really caught our attention, and I want to make sure that everyone really understands this situation, because it's being misconstrued in the media.
[03:10:00.154 --> 03:10:06.616]  It's being misconstrued and deliberately munged by many on social networking.
[03:10:07.296 --> 03:10:08.977]  And that's what I heard earlier.
[03:10:09.077 --> 03:10:10.417]  Owen was talking about this.
[03:10:11.558 --> 03:10:23.328]  It looks like President Donald Trump will have to resort to declaring a national emergency with respect to the border crisis, because we do have a crisis on the border.
[03:10:24.108 --> 03:10:39.661]  But let me get some facts straight about these national emergencies and about what a national emergency is, because you hear a lot about this, but how many people really understand what a national emergency is, what it does,
[03:10:40.334 --> 03:10:41.775]  And the history of it.
[03:10:42.135 --> 03:10:45.136]  And you might think, well, that's just, hey, it's boring and it really doesn't matter.
[03:10:45.236 --> 03:10:56.739]  Oh, it does matter because the the National National Emergencies Act of 1974 is really what applies here.
[03:10:57.319 --> 03:10:59.180]  And that was really done.
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:08.863]  That was a law under President Ford signed into law by President Ford under that specific Congress to rein in the powers of the presidency.
[03:11:09.443 --> 03:11:09.863]  However,
[03:11:10.555 --> 03:11:21.841]  Having done that, it also granted or further delineated or more specifically delineated the powers to our chief executive, that being, in this case, President Donald Trump.
[03:11:22.342 --> 03:11:37.710]  But when you look historically at this act, currently, and I don't know how many people know this, I'm not sure how many, if this was gone over, but you have right now, as I speak, 31 different ongoing national emergencies.
[03:11:39.059 --> 03:11:47.524]  The first and oldest emergency took place under President Carter back in 1979 during the Iran crisis, or the Iran hostage situation.
[03:11:48.305 --> 03:11:52.868]  And that was one of two, one of two declared by President Carter.
[03:11:53.708 --> 03:12:04.595]  Next you have, of the 31 you had, or including the 31, you had President Reagan who declared a total of six national emergencies during his time in office.
[03:12:05.436 --> 03:12:06.537]  President George H.W.
[03:12:06.597 --> 03:12:08.319]  Bush, Poppy Bush, declared four.
[03:12:08.899 --> 03:12:10.500]  And then all of a sudden, what do we see?
[03:12:10.921 --> 03:12:20.569]  Bill Clinton as a member of the Democratic Party, and of course, the husband of Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:20.589 --> 03:12:22.311]  I almost said something different.
[03:12:23.011 --> 03:12:25.153]  The subservient member of the Clinton family.
[03:12:26.214 --> 03:12:31.819]  Under Bill Clinton, you had 17 national emergencies, six of which are still intact or in effect.
[03:12:33.030 --> 03:12:36.354]  Moving to George W. Bush, of course, 9-11 happened.
[03:12:36.935 --> 03:12:41.160]  George W. Bush instituted 12 national emergencies under his reign.
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:42.642]  Ten are still in effect.
[03:12:43.303 --> 03:12:43.944]  And Obama
[03:12:44.856 --> 03:12:46.557]  Second only really to Bill Clinton.
[03:12:48.098 --> 03:12:52.420]  He declared 13 national emergencies, seven are still in effect.
[03:12:52.520 --> 03:13:08.447]  So when the lunatic liberals out there, when these when these Sissified individuals out there talk about the National Security Act and it's it's not for presidents or the president can't do this with respect to the Immigration and National Naturalization Act.
[03:13:09.367 --> 03:13:10.427]  Well, they're full of it.
[03:13:10.787 --> 03:13:31.492]  And I don't care if it's the leftists from CNN, the fake news members of the CNN group, or whatever mainstream media outlet you listen to, or even the political pundits, including but not limited to Napolitano and Fox News, the bottom line is he has every single right to declare a national emergency, as well he should in this case.
[03:13:32.225 --> 03:13:41.691]  Because we are looking at, again, this is a humanitarian crisis, but the humanitarian crisis was a manufactured or is a manufactured crisis.
[03:13:42.432 --> 03:13:54.020]  It's manufactured by the globalists, manufactured by the people who worship at the altar in the feet of George Soros, who worship at the altar of the Obamas and Clintons and such.
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:58.543]  So as soon as people understand that we are all being gamed,
[03:14:00.095 --> 03:14:05.519]  That these people have created this situation, along with the Uniparty.
[03:14:06.879 --> 03:14:20.607]  And when I refer to Democrats and Republicans, as I do, I don't want to continue to have to have disclaimers that Republicans, of course, and Democrats are of the same, really the same party, in essence, with few exceptions.
[03:14:21.008 --> 03:14:22.068]  They're members of the Uniparty.
[03:14:22.088 --> 03:14:24.149]  They're all globalists, for the most part.
[03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:28.292]  But it is because of their inaction over the years,
[03:14:28.925 --> 03:14:29.045]  Yeah.
[03:14:36.466 --> 03:14:42.488]  Signaled to foreign countries, especially the South and Central America, as well as Mexico, hey, our doors are open.
[03:14:42.868 --> 03:14:45.229]  We don't want your finest, brightest, or whatever.
[03:14:45.609 --> 03:14:55.352]  We want the people in this country to change the moral, ethical, and theological, as well as the demographic makeup of our country.
[03:14:55.772 --> 03:14:58.653]  And that's the intent all along, is to take down the United States.
[03:14:58.693 --> 03:15:01.094]  And of course, this is one of five or six battlefields.
[03:15:01.514 --> 03:15:02.514]  Quickly before the break,
[03:15:03.152 --> 03:15:07.576]  And then after the break, I'm going to bring Joe on because he's got some other facts and figures on this.
[03:15:07.937 --> 03:15:14.302]  When you look at the bigger picture here, the facts that, just a few facts that the Democratic Socialists don't want you to know about the border crisis.
[03:15:14.863 --> 03:15:24.612]  In fiscal year of 2018, 17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records were arrested by CBP and border agents.
[03:15:25.681 --> 03:15:28.162]  Those are people, that is, with criminal records.
[03:15:28.683 --> 03:15:31.024]  The numbers, folks, are staggering.
[03:15:31.344 --> 03:15:33.225]  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
[03:15:33.605 --> 03:15:39.888]  The children that are dying are dying not as a result of our agencies, but a result of the globalist policies.
[03:15:40.928 --> 03:15:46.874]  You are listening to InfoWars on this, day number 720, I believe it is, of the Donald J. Trump presidency.
[03:15:47.474 --> 03:15:49.776]  Sitting in for Alex Jones, it's Doug and Joe Hagman.
[03:15:50.077 --> 03:15:51.458]  HagmanReport.com.
[03:15:51.498 --> 03:15:52.499]  Two N's on Hagman.
[03:15:52.759 --> 03:15:53.580]  Folks, we're up against the break.
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:54.261]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:54.301 --> 03:15:55.302]  Stay right where you're at.
[03:15:55.342 --> 03:15:55.762]  More to come.
[03:16:07.702 --> 03:16:09.083]  Is it the end of our empire?
[03:16:09.203 --> 03:16:09.803]  Is that a good thing?
[03:16:09.823 --> 03:16:10.463]  Is that a bad thing?
[03:16:10.483 --> 03:16:14.425]  Because America's been an empire, but it's been absorbed in this big globalist empire.
[03:16:14.545 --> 03:16:16.426]  And are people smart enough to get out of it?
[03:16:17.106 --> 03:16:21.268]  There's an article here, The Life Cycles of Empires, Lessons for America Today.
[03:16:21.408 --> 03:16:24.629]  And the truth is, we've become extremely, extremely decadent.
[03:16:24.669 --> 03:16:26.750]  We've become extremely over-entertained.
[03:16:26.910 --> 03:16:28.731]  And people can't differentiate from reality.
[03:16:28.751 --> 03:16:34.914]  And so I sit back and I ask myself, what will this country look like in 10 years, in 20 years, if we fail?
[03:16:35.174 --> 03:16:38.235]  Trump thought he could restart America, and to a certain extent, we've done it.
[03:16:38.295 --> 03:16:48.000]  But when we kick-started the country, and its pulse came back to life, Trump was sure that if he could get that done, people would wake up out of their fog, wake up out of their leftist-induced coma, and that we could fix things.
[03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:56.203]  And we've seen that to a certain extent, but the propaganda, the election fraud, the vote-stealing, all of it is a green light to the establishment that no, Trump can be beat.
[03:16:56.344 --> 03:16:59.565]  And it's breathed new life into them, that they've gotten away with the massive censorship.
[03:16:59.605 --> 03:17:01.466]  They've gotten away with the incredible Divide and Conquer.
[03:17:01.526 --> 03:17:03.667]  They've gotten away with weaponizing media.
[03:17:03.707 --> 03:17:06.949]  They've gotten away with telling incredible lies stacked on more lies.
[03:17:07.089 --> 03:17:08.810]  Until you're just living in total fantasy land.
[03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:11.512]  So what do you think the world's going to look like in 20 years?
[03:17:12.012 --> 03:17:15.634]  We've already got world government pushing implantable microchips to buy and sell.
[03:17:15.674 --> 03:17:17.535]  And global social score is already here.
[03:17:17.595 --> 03:17:21.718]  And all the big tech giants tracking everything you do and putting it into huge databases.
[03:17:21.978 --> 03:17:27.281]  And trying to destroy middle class wealth and really create a horrible future where everything is consolidated.
[03:17:27.461 --> 03:17:30.484]  What will the dystopia look like if we fail?
[03:17:30.524 --> 03:17:36.350]  Of course, some will say, many will say, well, it's in the Bible that the Antichrist wages war against the saints and overcomes them.
[03:17:36.450 --> 03:17:41.415]  And for a short time, there's a planetary world government that if God didn't come back and stop it all, no flesh would be spared.
[03:17:41.615 --> 03:17:42.877]  Okay, well, when is that coming?
[03:17:42.937 --> 03:17:44.118]  What's that period look like?
[03:17:44.238 --> 03:17:49.343]  And shouldn't we, if that's the case and the proper interpretation, be warning everybody about the world government?
[03:17:49.363 --> 03:17:59.409]  about the microchip, about the peace system, so less you'd be saved, you would be deceived, you would be given over to a great delusion that 2 plus 2 equals 5, and that women are men and men are women.
[03:17:59.629 --> 03:18:15.538]  We're on a planet in deep space, and we are under the control of some very nasty people, who the Bible tells us have been given power by the father of lies, the god of this world, the fallen one that fell to this planet, who's trapped on this planet, and can only have dominion over us, not over the big boy out in space.
[03:18:15.778 --> 03:18:27.712]  And you sit back from a scientific cosmology, and you sit back and see what the globals are building, and man, if it isn't exactly what God told the prophets to warn us about, I'll eat my hat.
[03:18:37.153 --> 03:18:38.334]  Sandy in Minnesota.
[03:18:38.354 --> 03:18:39.775]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[03:18:39.875 --> 03:18:40.395]  Hi, Alex.
[03:18:40.495 --> 03:18:42.817]  Two years I've waited to talk to you.
[03:18:42.897 --> 03:18:43.737]  What an honor it is.
[03:18:43.877 --> 03:18:46.359]  And I'd like to tell you that your products are amazing.
[03:18:46.399 --> 03:18:49.401]  They're absolutely game changers in everything that you do.
[03:18:49.421 --> 03:18:51.202]  I have the Silver Bullet.
[03:18:51.322 --> 03:18:53.684]  I have the Ace Iodine, the Secret 12.
[03:18:53.804 --> 03:18:55.065]  Your new Happy is
[03:18:55.425 --> 03:18:56.086]  Unbelievable.
[03:18:56.206 --> 03:18:56.987]  The floral life.
[03:18:57.167 --> 03:19:00.451]  My daughter suffers from IBS really bad and it took it away.
[03:19:00.611 --> 03:19:02.273]  Totally not a problem anymore.
[03:19:02.293 --> 03:19:03.495]  And then she got a cut.
[03:19:03.595 --> 03:19:05.017]  A pretty bad paper cut the other day.
[03:19:05.157 --> 03:19:06.899]  Long story short, it was infected.
[03:19:07.119 --> 03:19:07.860]  Put it on there.
[03:19:07.940 --> 03:19:10.343]  Two days later, it was scabbed up and almost peeled over.
[03:19:10.563 --> 03:19:14.045]  Oh, I gotta tell you, I don't mean to digress into the products, but I'm not a big cat person.
[03:19:14.065 --> 03:19:15.886]  My mom had cats growing up and dogs.
[03:19:15.966 --> 03:19:19.388]  My wife has two cats, and we got another male cat that was a kitten.
[03:19:19.428 --> 03:19:20.068]  Now it's big.
[03:19:20.108 --> 03:19:22.250]  It fights with the older tabby that's 14 pounds.
[03:19:22.350 --> 03:19:23.971]  So the other night, there's this huge fight in the living room.
[03:19:24.011 --> 03:19:30.974]  I go out there, and I try to pull him apart, and the bigger one climbs up my arm, pushes off, tears it completely open.
[03:19:31.114 --> 03:19:34.316]  And I've had cat scratches before that took three, four weeks to heal.
[03:19:34.496 --> 03:19:35.797]  It's like 70% healed.
[03:19:37.538 --> 03:19:43.141]  In only like eight, nine days, and I'm telling you, I put the silver wound gel and the colloidal silver all over.
[03:19:43.161 --> 03:19:44.682]  The silver wound gel is specifically made for that.
[03:19:45.182 --> 03:19:47.924]  And it just, because you know how dirty cats are with their back paws.
[03:19:47.944 --> 03:19:51.926]  I don't want to go into details here, but yes, silver is critical.
[03:19:51.986 --> 03:19:55.088]  Yes, and I also have the toothpaste, and that's really amazing, too.
[03:19:55.288 --> 03:19:56.589]  Your products are amazing.
[03:19:56.629 --> 03:19:59.571]  They're absolutely game changers in everything that you do.
[03:20:06.363 --> 03:20:10.386]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.818 --> 03:20:28.961]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:29.461 --> 03:20:33.505]  It's Alex Jones with Doug Eggman.
[03:20:36.828 --> 03:20:40.731]  Welcome back to this segment with the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:40.771 --> 03:20:41.731]  InfoWars.com.
[03:20:41.771 --> 03:20:48.115]  I want to thank each and every person out there who has supported this operation by ordering the products.
[03:20:48.135 --> 03:20:49.316]  Let me tell you something.
[03:20:49.356 --> 03:20:51.938]  Do you notice a little bit more of an edge I've got?
[03:20:52.298 --> 03:20:55.220]  It's because of the products from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:55.960 --> 03:20:56.540]  I'll say this.
[03:20:56.841 --> 03:20:58.382]  I was a good boy.
[03:20:58.422 --> 03:21:03.205]  Well, at least according to my wife and I did get a nice package of InfoWarsStore
[03:21:04.385 --> 03:21:10.507]  And after taking the super male vitality among other products, folks shop there.
[03:21:11.148 --> 03:21:15.389]  I can now not just see the camera, I can see through the camera.
[03:21:15.589 --> 03:21:15.909]  OK.
[03:21:16.290 --> 03:21:17.250]  Of course, I'm kidding.
[03:21:17.370 --> 03:21:18.590]  That's I'm going to get emails.
[03:21:19.271 --> 03:21:19.971]  But here's the thing.
[03:21:20.743 --> 03:21:21.263]  They work.
[03:21:21.303 --> 03:21:22.144]  The products work.
[03:21:22.404 --> 03:21:27.687]  And by ordering from Infowarsstore.com, you're helping fund the fight.
[03:21:28.047 --> 03:21:30.069]  We are at war with the globalists.
[03:21:30.109 --> 03:21:36.232]  We're at war with the evil in this country and across the world.
[03:21:36.592 --> 03:21:37.213]  We're at war.
[03:21:38.113 --> 03:21:47.259]  But the other side of that, in addition to being at war, we are also informing the people who otherwise would not get this information
[03:21:47.999 --> 03:21:54.642]  And we need to do that, because otherwise you're still going to have a bunch of googly-eyed people out there who have no clue what's going on.
[03:21:55.482 --> 03:21:58.884]  And I'll tell you what, between you and I, and I think you'd agree with me on this,
[03:22:00.141 --> 03:22:00.581]  Times two.
[03:22:01.181 --> 03:22:02.022]  We don't have enough time.
[03:22:02.542 --> 03:22:04.262]  We need to educate these people quickly.
[03:22:04.682 --> 03:22:06.323]  So fund the help fund the operation.
[03:22:06.463 --> 03:22:07.423]  Help fund the operation.
[03:22:07.503 --> 03:22:08.723]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:22:09.063 --> 03:22:10.384]  The products are magnificent.
[03:22:10.684 --> 03:22:13.264]  I guarantee you, for example, the male vitality.
[03:22:13.404 --> 03:22:14.945]  It'll just knock your socks off.
[03:22:15.545 --> 03:22:17.085]  Support this operation.
[03:22:17.125 --> 03:22:19.626]  I cannot tell you how much, how important that is.
[03:22:20.402 --> 03:22:22.926]  And support InfoWars.com as well.
[03:22:22.986 --> 03:22:29.937]  Make sure that for every single person who wants this operation shut down.
[03:22:30.663 --> 03:22:35.164]  Once it's censored, you tell 10, 20 people about this operation.
[03:22:35.824 --> 03:22:45.146]  It's that important, because if we lose at this level, we're going to lose a hell of a lot more than just our way of life.
[03:22:45.166 --> 03:22:47.747]  We're going to lose our entire country, and we can't have that.
[03:22:48.147 --> 03:22:55.349]  Now, before the break, I was talking about the wall and, of course, the border, border security.
[03:22:55.409 --> 03:22:56.409]  Big news, of course.
[03:22:57.049 --> 03:23:08.845]  And President Donald Trump, of course, has the legal authority to declare a national emergency and specific to the Immigration Act of 1965 in that narrow band.
[03:23:09.205 --> 03:23:11.729]  I just, before I cut the joke, I want to say one thing.
[03:23:12.463 --> 03:23:21.551]  What I heard on CNN, I believe it was CNN, but I know it was attributed to Jason Johnson, made me want to vomit.
[03:23:21.571 --> 03:23:23.853]  In fact, I think I threw up a little bit in my mouth when I heard this.
[03:23:24.454 --> 03:23:31.120]  He stated, and I quote, the wall is a monument to white nationalism.
[03:23:32.185 --> 03:23:53.125]  Now how in the hell can, and I'm asking this, what gall, what unmitigated gall for him or others to stand on the graves of children who have died crossing the border and say that this is a monument to white nationalism?
[03:23:53.800 --> 03:24:07.575]  And if that's not good enough, the others who have said, and I'm referencing here in my notes, those who support the wall are not sophisticated, they're not that bright, and they're racist.
[03:24:08.336 --> 03:24:09.197]  That's how much the
[03:24:09.913 --> 03:24:22.199]  Fake news media, and of course you know that, think of you, but even more importantly, that's how much the politicians, the unit party in Washington, think of you, and it's sickening if you accept that.
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:23.360]  Joe is with me.
[03:24:23.380 --> 03:24:24.160]  We're going to be talking.
[03:24:24.180 --> 03:24:27.122]  We've done so much, so much investigation on this.
[03:24:27.502 --> 03:24:28.803]  Joe, I'm going to kick it over to you.
[03:24:28.883 --> 03:24:35.566]  I know I hogged the first segment, but I frankly, I'm just, I am absolutely, I'm done.
[03:24:35.786 --> 03:24:36.147]  I'm done.
[03:24:39.813 --> 03:24:47.536]  We have people, a new congressman, Ocasio-Cortez, suggesting illegal immigrants are more American than Trump supporters.
[03:24:48.176 --> 03:24:55.418]  And this is the liberal insanity being showcased by this 116th Congress, which is exactly what I expected to see.
[03:24:55.438 --> 03:25:01.160]  This Congress is going to be a two-year reel for a Donald Trump 2020 re-election campaign.
[03:25:01.681 --> 03:25:05.602]  And this wall and the immigration issue is front and center in this right now.
[03:25:05.982 --> 03:25:07.384]  But there's a great piece from The Hill.
[03:25:07.484 --> 03:25:11.008]  Yes, Trump has the authority to declare a national emergency for border wall.
[03:25:11.568 --> 03:25:26.184]  And this article that is written by Jonathan Turley goes into a number of facts citing constitutional and other abilities that the president would be able to use under his authority to put the wall in place.
[03:25:27.285 --> 03:25:38.092]  What's very interesting about this, these liberals who are the Schumers and the Pelosi's who issued their response to Trump's address to the nation, which I want to talk about too if we have time this hour.
[03:25:38.112 --> 03:25:43.095]  They issued this very silly disjointed response and the optics were terrible.
[03:25:43.515 --> 03:25:46.637]  But an interesting fact, Democrats paid for a wall.
[03:25:47.257 --> 03:25:48.057]  In Jordan.
[03:25:48.538 --> 03:25:49.238]  And listen to this.
[03:25:50.118 --> 03:26:05.525]  Chuck Schumer, he was one of the people who was sponsoring and signed this bill under Barack Obama, funded a 287-mile border wall in Jordan just last year, but won't fund the border wall here in the United States because it's immoral, according to Nancy Pelosi.
[03:26:06.045 --> 03:26:24.289]  But one year ago, in the 2018 Omnibus Spending Bill, it provides just enough funds to build 33 miles of fencing on the Texas border, but it also provides $500 million to help Jordan build a wall and defense line against a Jihad terrorist trying to cross its 287-mile border with Iraq and Syria.
[03:26:24.770 --> 03:26:26.490]  So the Omnibus Budget says on page
[03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:29.331]  That's a quote from Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit.
[03:26:56.267 --> 03:27:08.414]  So, even President Trump went over to Congress Wednesday for a chat that deteriorated into him walking out in disgust because there is no negotiating, apparently no more debates, no more dialogues.
[03:27:08.755 --> 03:27:09.815]  They have nothing to offer.
[03:27:09.855 --> 03:27:11.696]  The Democrats do have nothing to offer.
[03:27:11.736 --> 03:27:13.818]  They refuse to add the funding.
[03:27:13.838 --> 03:27:15.539]  It's not even a lot of money.
[03:27:15.579 --> 03:27:16.919]  We're talking $5 billion.
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:19.541]  We've given more aid to Mexico and Central America.
[03:27:20.746 --> 03:27:23.149]  Relative, okay, we're talking $5 billion, yeah.
[03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:25.512]  It's not a lot of money relative to the budget, okay?
[03:27:25.572 --> 03:27:26.353]  I don't have $5 billion.
[03:27:26.373 --> 03:27:28.416]  Right, right, right.
[03:27:28.436 --> 03:27:30.239]  $5 billion is a lot of money to me.
[03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:35.426]  But yeah, not to the, you know what we're talking about, trillion dollar spending bills.
[03:27:36.363 --> 03:27:42.330]  Yeah, but you've got Tweedledum and Tweedledummer attempting to refute the morality of a wall.
[03:27:42.610 --> 03:27:43.651]  You've got Ma and Paul Kettle.
[03:27:43.691 --> 03:27:44.872]  I love the memes, by the way.
[03:27:45.393 --> 03:27:47.215]  I'm not big on that, but I do love that.
[03:27:47.475 --> 03:27:49.037]  And I think that they own that.
[03:27:49.558 --> 03:27:53.722]  But here's the other issue to that, of course, the walls elsewhere.
[03:27:57.149 --> 03:27:57.989]  The bigger objective.
[03:27:58.009 --> 03:28:00.070]  I think people are losing sight of the bigger objective here.
[03:28:00.650 --> 03:28:02.450]  They hate America.
[03:28:02.550 --> 03:28:05.551]  So we're talking about Pelosi and Schumer.
[03:28:05.931 --> 03:28:06.911]  They hate America.
[03:28:07.111 --> 03:28:08.192]  They hate Donald Trump.
[03:28:08.512 --> 03:28:15.313]  They want to burn this country down or will burn this country down simply because they hate Donald Trump more than they love America.
[03:28:15.573 --> 03:28:16.914]  And I'm sick and tired.
[03:28:16.934 --> 03:28:18.754]  I hope everyone else is sick and tired.
[03:28:18.914 --> 03:28:22.555]  And by the way, I spoke to a member of our congressional district.
[03:28:23.035 --> 03:28:26.356]  They are saying if American people start calling
[03:28:26.916 --> 03:28:28.356]  And making their voices known.
[03:28:28.476 --> 03:28:29.797]  That's making a difference!
[03:28:30.097 --> 03:28:32.137]  So get off the couch.
[03:28:32.177 --> 03:28:32.797]  Pick up the phone.
[03:28:33.097 --> 03:28:33.717]  Make a call.
[03:28:33.897 --> 03:28:34.418]  Be nice.
[03:28:35.058 --> 03:28:36.838]  Let's say we demand a wall.
[03:28:37.198 --> 03:28:40.999]  We demand it.
[03:28:41.019 --> 03:28:41.459]  50 complaints?
[03:28:41.599 --> 03:28:43.659]  That they start to address it?
[03:28:44.600 --> 03:28:45.060]  That's right.
[03:28:45.380 --> 03:28:48.840]  It's anywhere between 50 to... Really, it's lower than you think.
[03:28:48.860 --> 03:28:50.141]  So you can make a difference.
[03:28:50.181 --> 03:28:51.581]  Folks, you're listening to InfoWars.
[03:28:52.054 --> 03:28:58.945]  Infowars.com on this, the, what is this, the 10 days into January for Crying Out Loud.
[03:28:59.406 --> 03:29:00.047]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:00.087 --> 03:29:00.528]  Stay with us.
[03:29:02.398 --> 03:29:06.619]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[03:29:07.599 --> 03:29:13.440]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[03:29:13.920 --> 03:29:23.342]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[03:29:23.842 --> 03:29:25.042]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[03:29:25.603 --> 03:29:27.903]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[03:29:28.483 --> 03:29:40.926]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes.
[03:29:41.006 --> 03:29:44.627]  Everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[03:29:44.787 --> 03:29:53.789]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:55.130]  But now,
[03:29:56.129 --> 03:30:14.473]  They have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[03:30:15.253 --> 03:30:17.494]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[03:30:18.494 --> 03:30:22.197]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[03:30:22.237 --> 03:30:22.858]  They're patriots.
[03:30:23.258 --> 03:30:34.566]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[03:30:35.127 --> 03:30:35.947]  You drop ship it.
[03:30:36.047 --> 03:30:36.668]  You get it out.
[03:30:36.868 --> 03:30:37.769]  You have the website.
[03:30:38.369 --> 03:30:38.969]  I promote it.
[03:30:39.150 --> 03:30:40.030]  I send people there.
[03:30:40.310 --> 03:30:43.253]  And that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[03:30:43.953 --> 03:30:47.396]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[03:30:48.513 --> 03:30:58.143]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[03:30:58.903 --> 03:31:03.648]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[03:31:03.928 --> 03:31:12.037]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[03:31:13.223 --> 03:31:23.331]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[03:31:23.612 --> 03:31:25.453]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[03:31:25.493 --> 03:31:26.074]  I've researched it.
[03:31:26.094 --> 03:31:31.578]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[03:31:31.598 --> 03:31:32.999]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[03:31:33.820 --> 03:31:45.728]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[03:31:47.026 --> 03:31:54.890]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[03:31:55.570 --> 03:32:11.798]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all, because they have more than 40 products.
[03:32:12.158 --> 03:32:14.919]  Now, remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[03:32:15.119 --> 03:32:16.120]  They've tried to shut us down.
[03:32:16.900 --> 03:32:18.101]  They've tried to boycott us.
[03:32:18.121 --> 03:32:18.922]  They've tried to sue us.
[03:32:19.442 --> 03:32:25.908]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[03:32:26.148 --> 03:32:33.915]  We're still going to do that for themforwarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[03:32:34.015 --> 03:32:35.836]  And this is the first big one.
[03:32:36.197 --> 03:32:37.057]  So I'm very excited.
[03:32:37.077 --> 03:32:37.858]  Be sure and go there.
[03:32:37.938 --> 03:32:44.584]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[03:32:44.804 --> 03:32:47.065]  Highest quality, the lowest prices.
[03:32:47.526 --> 03:32:53.309]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the InfoWar the whole time.
[03:33:05.775 --> 03:33:08.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.575 --> 03:33:25.158]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:25.498 --> 03:33:31.169]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Doug Hagman.
[03:33:37.291 --> 03:33:39.351]  Doug Hagman, HagmanReport.com.
[03:33:39.391 --> 03:33:41.492]  Two ends on Hagman, HagmanReport.com.
[03:33:41.532 --> 03:33:43.912]  Sitting in this hour along with Joe Hagman, my son.
[03:33:43.952 --> 03:33:46.413]  Of course, you can tune in 7 to 10 p.m.
[03:33:46.473 --> 03:33:49.654]  Eastern Time every weeknight for our show.
[03:33:49.714 --> 03:33:51.474]  But right now, so important.
[03:33:52.074 --> 03:33:54.915]  So many issues facing this country today.
[03:33:55.395 --> 03:33:58.395]  The globalists, you know, Alex says the globalists are on the run.
[03:33:58.835 --> 03:34:01.396]  And it's interesting to watch the people freaking out and say,
[03:34:01.696 --> 03:34:03.058]  Well, no, they're not on the run.
[03:34:03.098 --> 03:34:04.479]  Yes, we've got them on the run.
[03:34:04.840 --> 03:34:06.141]  It's because of InfoWars.
[03:34:06.201 --> 03:34:07.343]  It's because of our show.
[03:34:07.623 --> 03:34:12.709]  It's because of the people who are awake and who are telling other people out there that, look, this is the truth.
[03:34:12.769 --> 03:34:13.730]  We're all getting gamed.
[03:34:14.351 --> 03:34:15.792]  And it's them versus us.
[03:34:15.872 --> 03:34:17.114]  It really is that simple.
[03:34:17.154 --> 03:34:18.916]  We've got enemies within the gate.
[03:34:20.396 --> 03:34:24.559]  This is not hyperbole, and this is not an overstatement, but the fact is this.
[03:34:24.639 --> 03:34:28.002]  We are right now in a civil war, civil war not of our making.
[03:34:28.623 --> 03:34:31.405]  And I just, I want to mention something.
[03:34:31.986 --> 03:34:36.930]  I just, you know, I've said this so many times, and I say this with a heavy heart.
[03:34:37.470 --> 03:34:40.573]  But I ask, you know, what could be worse than a civil war?
[03:34:40.633 --> 03:34:41.773]  Because that would be horrific.
[03:34:42.354 --> 03:34:46.257]  I suppose from an ideological standpoint, maybe not having one.
[03:34:47.458 --> 03:34:53.682]  If there is a lack of any kind of congruity, or if it's... See, here's the problem.
[03:34:55.644 --> 03:34:59.687]  We are a country not arguing about the means or methods.
[03:34:59.767 --> 03:35:00.728]  And think about this.
[03:35:01.849 --> 03:35:04.631]  The divisiveness is the objectives.
[03:35:05.567 --> 03:35:09.588]  It's not how to get to where we want to go, where the division exists.
[03:35:09.728 --> 03:35:11.028]  And please understand this.
[03:35:11.848 --> 03:35:14.829]  In fact, the professor, I believe, speaking in Hillsdale College said this.
[03:35:16.410 --> 03:35:27.192]  If we were a country who was divided over the methods of fixing our country or creating our country, if the division was how to, that's workable.
[03:35:27.772 --> 03:35:31.333]  But when we are pulling in opposite directions with respect to
[03:35:32.248 --> 03:35:35.210]  The objectives of where we want to be.
[03:35:35.230 --> 03:35:40.174]  Is this going to be a communist, socialist utopia?
[03:35:40.395 --> 03:35:42.656]  Is that what this is going to be?
[03:35:43.357 --> 03:35:46.459]  Because it cannot exist in the Constitutional Republic.
[03:35:46.479 --> 03:35:57.328]  So you've got on one side the red element, and it's not a red wave as one would expect, but it's a red, as in communist, crimson red.
[03:35:58.425 --> 03:36:01.406]  And the objective is to get there by any means necessary.
[03:36:01.466 --> 03:36:08.948]  The Clappers, and the Brennans, and the Comeys, and the Obamas, and the Rices, and the Lynches, and you know, the usual suspects in the Clintons.
[03:36:10.508 --> 03:36:11.648]  And on the other side, it's us.
[03:36:13.929 --> 03:36:15.329]  And Joe, I know that we've talked...
[03:36:20.417 --> 03:36:27.259]  This border wall thing, and the more I read into this, the more I want to rip my own hair out.
[03:36:27.319 --> 03:36:34.282]  Watching Pelosi and Schumer, we mentioned Trump's first Oval Office address to the nation, which I gotta say, I wish he would do more of.
[03:36:34.982 --> 03:36:37.183]  Many things President Trump does great.
[03:36:37.563 --> 03:36:40.844]  One of the things that bugs me most about the President
[03:36:41.344 --> 03:36:43.185]  It was a pathetic piece of, it was a pathetic response.
[03:37:09.092 --> 03:37:14.195]  And what was Pelosi's, if you heard and listened to what they said, they laid out their own plan for border security.
[03:37:14.215 --> 03:37:14.915]  What did they want to do?
[03:37:15.276 --> 03:37:27.462]  Oh, they wanted to fix the roads and ports of entries to make it easier for illegal aliens to come in, not addressing any kind of security in the areas where there are no fencings and there are no borders.
[03:37:27.943 --> 03:37:29.304]  And I mean, it's just a joke.
[03:37:29.364 --> 03:37:32.645]  And I have the transcript here, which I'm not going to get into right now.
[03:37:34.166 --> 03:37:37.749]  Unbelievably, they, as I said, paid for the wall in Jordan.
[03:37:38.149 --> 03:37:45.835]  And Trump does have the ability to use his constitutional, under the Constitution, he has the power to declare a national emergency and get this done himself.
[03:37:46.335 --> 03:37:51.218]  Even though they are not willing and will fight tooth and nail saying that it's unconstitutional.
[03:37:52.379 --> 03:37:59.965]  They want, they, the left, they are refusing to acknowledge the severity of the problems of the southern border.
[03:38:00.045 --> 03:38:02.867]  One, it's a humanitarian and security crisis.
[03:38:03.307 --> 03:38:08.011]  And this is an article from NPR, fact-checking Trump's Oval Office pitch for a border wall.
[03:38:08.471 --> 03:38:10.072]  And it's a joke, obviously.
[03:38:10.392 --> 03:38:11.652]  There is no fact-checking here.
[03:38:12.573 --> 03:38:18.015]  They are trying to spin their propaganda so they can, you know, promote their open border agenda.
[03:38:18.315 --> 03:38:20.836]  But claim one, humanitarian and security crisis.
[03:38:20.876 --> 03:38:23.717]  There is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border.
[03:38:23.737 --> 03:38:24.697]  That's what President Trump said.
[03:38:25.097 --> 03:38:46.261]  Well, according to the fact checkers, that's not true, because the number of illegal aliens crossing is much lower than it was in 2016 or 2014, according to this article, but that only is until September of 2018, but we've seen a huge surge since then of 60,000, both in October and November, and yesterday we got the statistic
[03:38:46.621 --> 03:38:53.307]  That in December alone, Border Patrol detained 29,518 illegal aliens crossing the border.
[03:38:53.327 --> 03:38:55.028]  So yes, this is a huge crisis.
[03:38:55.949 --> 03:38:59.052]  I want to interrupt you here because you bring up an important point.
[03:38:59.092 --> 03:38:59.992]  Listen to this.
[03:39:00.353 --> 03:39:10.221]  Because the people that not caught at the border, that got into the inside of this country, outside of that 100 mile buffer zone around the coast and around the borders,
[03:39:12.037 --> 03:39:39.573]  Last year, okay, think about this, because people are, I mean, you've got to be absolutely out of your mind, people, if this is okay with you and the Pelosi's and the Schumer's and the fact-checkers and the garbage, in my view, in my personal opinion, now the garbage, you know, these right-wing watch and whatever else, kind of PolitiFact and all these garbage places, again, in my view,
[03:39:40.033 --> 03:39:40.213]  Yes.
[03:39:59.598 --> 03:40:13.761]  Last year, I'm sorry, fiscal year 2017 and 2018, ICE officers arrested approximately a quarter of a million illegal aliens on various criminal charges or convictions within the interior of the United States.
[03:40:14.021 --> 03:40:17.082]  These are people who got in, who went 100 plus miles.
[03:40:18.122 --> 03:40:22.803]  They live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Omaha, Nebraska, Cincinnati, Ohio, or wherever.
[03:40:23.244 --> 03:40:23.904]  Think about that.
[03:40:24.424 --> 03:40:25.264]  And by the way,
[03:40:26.212 --> 03:40:33.445]  That includes over $100,000 for assault, $30,000 for rape and sex crimes, and another $4,000 for homicides.
[03:40:33.926 --> 03:40:35.369]  So there's your fact-checking.
[03:40:36.130 --> 03:40:45.173]  Yeah, and you know, the Democrats on the left and the media are trying to downplay the true dangers of having these open borders.
[03:40:45.493 --> 03:40:50.835]  One of the claims here in this NPR article is about illegal drugs, and this is what the president said.
[03:40:50.855 --> 03:40:54.256]  Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs.
[03:40:54.576 --> 03:40:59.238]  My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border to stop
[03:40:59.398 --> 03:40:59.899]  I don't know.
[03:41:19.269 --> 03:41:20.370]  How do they know?
[03:41:38.283 --> 03:41:38.764]  We're good.
[03:41:59.704 --> 03:42:00.204]  We're good to go.
[03:42:29.679 --> 03:42:33.861]  The illegal immigrant was already out on bail for a previous DUI.
[03:42:34.361 --> 03:42:39.983]  And after he was caught, he was released on $5,000 bail.
[03:42:40.183 --> 03:42:41.283]  And he fled the country.
[03:42:41.683 --> 03:42:43.784]  And these illegal aliens seem to be getting more rights.
[03:42:44.524 --> 03:42:44.945]  It's right.
[03:42:45.145 --> 03:42:46.285]  He lied to the courts.
[03:42:46.705 --> 03:42:49.986]  And there's nothing that was able to be done.
[03:42:50.066 --> 03:42:51.647]  Folks, you're listening to InfoWars.

[03:42:56.169 --> 03:42:57.309]  Support this operation.
[03:43:07.333 --> 03:43:19.299]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[03:43:20.498 --> 03:43:38.984]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[03:43:40.624 --> 03:43:42.685]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[03:43:43.045 --> 03:43:43.925]  Whole Foods was number two.
[03:43:44.765 --> 03:43:50.087]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[03:43:51.673 --> 03:43:57.938]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[03:43:59.219 --> 03:44:12.909]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at Infowarslife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[03:44:13.809 --> 03:44:15.871]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[03:44:16.784 --> 03:44:19.692]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[03:44:19.853 --> 03:44:20.474]  No response.
[03:44:20.695 --> 03:44:21.677]  They never want to get my comment.
[03:44:22.219 --> 03:44:23.121]  Now, why am I saying that?
[03:44:24.405 --> 03:44:24.766]  It's simple.
[03:44:25.814 --> 03:44:30.378]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[03:44:30.759 --> 03:44:36.064]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[03:44:36.705 --> 03:44:37.946]  So we have a great product.
[03:44:38.066 --> 03:44:38.486]  You love it.
[03:44:38.546 --> 03:44:39.167]  You reorder it.
[03:44:39.547 --> 03:44:41.810]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[03:44:42.270 --> 03:44:44.192]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[03:44:44.352 --> 03:44:45.393]  It's a 360 win.
[03:44:45.753 --> 03:44:46.434]  We defeat them.
[03:44:46.514 --> 03:44:46.895]  You win.
[03:44:47.015 --> 03:44:47.355]  I win.
[03:44:47.655 --> 03:44:48.156]  It's amazing.
[03:44:50.009 --> 03:44:54.794]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:54.834 --> 03:45:10.431]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[03:45:12.354 --> 03:45:12.874]  It's hard to believe.
[03:45:12.954 --> 03:45:15.696]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[03:45:15.776 --> 03:45:23.259]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[03:45:24.099 --> 03:45:26.360]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[03:45:26.380 --> 03:45:35.885]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[03:45:35.985 --> 03:45:36.685]  But just know this.
[03:45:38.703 --> 03:45:46.827]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[03:45:47.147 --> 03:45:49.368]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[03:45:50.109 --> 03:46:00.434]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[03:46:01.254 --> 03:46:02.334]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[03:46:02.434 --> 03:46:03.095]  I'm garbage.
[03:46:04.115 --> 03:46:05.756]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[03:46:05.956 --> 03:46:07.257]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[03:46:08.450 --> 03:46:09.813]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[03:46:10.435 --> 03:46:11.537]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[03:46:12.319 --> 03:46:13.963]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[03:46:15.125 --> 03:46:16.789]  Super metal Vitality, they have similar products.
[03:46:16.869 --> 03:46:17.571]  It's all dynamite.
[03:46:19.147 --> 03:46:22.989]  They can tell you how great it is and show you all the facts and tell you, because they're the elite.
[03:46:23.329 --> 03:46:25.590]  I'm just scum, just like you, according to them.
[03:46:25.630 --> 03:46:28.071]  But the good news is you've seen how great these products work.
[03:46:28.411 --> 03:46:32.592]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[03:46:33.073 --> 03:46:38.155]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience super male vitality, super female vitality.
[03:46:38.335 --> 03:46:48.459]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, super male vitality, super female, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[03:46:48.979 --> 03:46:49.939]  Because it's so frustrating.
[03:46:49.959 --> 03:46:53.141]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[03:46:53.301 --> 03:46:58.183]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at MFWoreStore.com and MFWoresLife.com.
[03:46:58.363 --> 03:46:59.263]  Thanks for your support.
[03:47:06.646 --> 03:47:09.307]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.927 --> 03:47:26.810]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:27.250 --> 03:47:31.015]  It's Alex Jones with Doug Hagman.
[03:47:33.770 --> 03:47:38.191]  Welcome back to InfoWars, InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:38.211 --> 03:47:39.612]  You've got to fund the operation.
[03:47:39.652 --> 03:47:43.773]  You've got to be, I'll tell you what, some tremendous products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:43.793 --> 03:47:44.553]  Take advantage of that.
[03:47:45.234 --> 03:47:54.616]  And of course, while you're doing that, you gain the benefit of health and you gain the benefit of being more robust and vibrant.
[03:47:55.337 --> 03:47:56.737]  It's just fantastic products.
[03:47:57.359 --> 03:48:02.940]  All the products, every product there at the InfoWarsStore.com, well worth the money.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:23.365]  Before we get back into really the issues at hand, I saw a story, this was published two days ago, and Owen earlier was talking, and by the way, we met Owen and Branson, had a great time with Owen Schroer of Branson, Missouri, a fantastic, fantastic asset to InfoWars,
[03:48:26.022 --> 03:48:27.283]  Um, to relate to the movement.
[03:48:27.303 --> 03:48:36.228]  But anyway, I saw the story and I know Owen was talking about toxic masculinity and it amazes me because I look, I'm an old guy.
[03:48:36.248 --> 03:48:36.828]  All right.
[03:48:37.889 --> 03:48:38.969]  I'm, I'm an old guy.
[03:48:39.190 --> 03:48:46.914]  I'm, you know, I'm, I'm not, I've been around the block a few times, but when I was growing up, here's the deal.
[03:48:47.854 --> 03:48:54.018]  In my science class, we were taught there were two genders, two sexes, whatever you want to call them, male and female.
[03:48:55.351 --> 03:49:15.825]  Real simple there's no I mean that there's some scientific and now anomalies we I understand that I get that but now with the of course the the special classes being created for the purposes of what for division and Throwing a good measure of toxic masculinity.
[03:49:15.865 --> 03:49:16.585]  What are we seeing?
[03:49:16.625 --> 03:49:24.851]  We're seeing the lack of men and I'm talking and I would I dare say this To the women out there look
[03:49:27.481 --> 03:49:32.168]  Some of the brightest people I know, most intelligent people I know are women.
[03:49:32.829 --> 03:49:36.694]  And I'm the kind of guy who I believe I should open the door for a woman.
[03:49:37.558 --> 03:49:41.200]  I believe I should pull a chair out for a woman, take a woman's coat.
[03:49:41.600 --> 03:49:44.181]  Because frankly, I believe women should be on pedestals.
[03:49:44.261 --> 03:49:47.483]  I think that they do a lot for guys, us guys.
[03:49:47.923 --> 03:49:49.724]  I know my wife does and I appreciate that.
[03:49:50.404 --> 03:49:55.467]  And I think women appreciate strong guys, right?
[03:49:56.047 --> 03:49:56.527]  Am I right?
[03:49:57.608 --> 03:49:58.388]  Ladies, am I right?
[03:49:58.468 --> 03:49:58.869]  I don't know.
[03:49:59.849 --> 03:50:00.369]  I think so.
[03:50:01.170 --> 03:50:03.591]  Of course, then you've got the other
[03:50:04.700 --> 03:50:05.981]  I don't know what you would call them.
[03:50:06.521 --> 03:50:07.862]  I know what I call them.
[03:50:07.922 --> 03:50:08.963]  They're delusional.
[03:50:09.743 --> 03:50:16.948]  Where they believe, of course, any kind of actions like that, that's an affront to their whatever.
[03:50:17.408 --> 03:50:19.269]  And to me, that's just a bunch of BS.
[03:50:19.289 --> 03:50:24.272]  But the fact of the matter is, there's a bunch of soy boys running around here.
[03:50:24.733 --> 03:50:25.813]  And for a lot of reasons.
[03:50:25.873 --> 03:50:26.834]  But I saw a story.
[03:50:27.794 --> 03:50:31.597]  Mother of armed robbers shot dead by defending his children.
[03:50:33.731 --> 03:50:35.091]  The bottom line story is this, folks.
[03:50:35.111 --> 03:50:35.792]  Did you see this?
[03:50:36.232 --> 03:50:37.912]  All right.
[03:50:37.932 --> 03:50:47.514]  A guy, a young man, a 19-year-old guy, entered a Popeyes restaurant in San Antonio last month, pointed a gun at the customer's children.
[03:50:47.654 --> 03:50:54.075]  That customer, licensed to conceal carry, shot the gunman dead.
[03:50:54.095 --> 03:51:01.657]  Now, mom of the 19-year-old, the deceased 19-year-old gunman, you got the picture, right?
[03:51:03.050 --> 03:51:10.213]  Now the mother of the deceased 19-year-old gunman is asking why the father who fatally shot her son chose to fire more than once.
[03:51:11.614 --> 03:51:16.656]  Cynthia Ruiz said that her son, Anthony Harara... I don't know how to pronounce it.
[03:51:16.696 --> 03:51:17.517]  I guess it's Harara.
[03:51:18.077 --> 03:51:19.237]  Harara, I guess.
[03:51:19.537 --> 03:51:19.978]  Pardon me.
[03:51:19.998 --> 03:51:21.538]  I don't mean to be offensive.
[03:51:23.159 --> 03:51:24.720]  He deserved to be punished.
[03:51:25.020 --> 03:51:29.802]  Yeah, he deserved to be punished because, after all, he's holding the gun to this gentleman's kids.
[03:51:32.603 --> 03:51:36.086]  But while defending his family, she admits that.
[03:51:36.147 --> 03:51:39.230]  But she said, why shoot him four more times?
[03:51:39.390 --> 03:51:41.692]  So why did he shoot him five times?
[03:51:43.093 --> 03:51:45.235]  All right, I know the capacity of my magazine.
[03:51:45.616 --> 03:51:52.022]  And I guarantee you, someone holding a gun on my kids, that magazine is going to be empty.
[03:51:52.582 --> 03:51:53.784]  And I'm going to be looking to reload.
[03:51:55.045 --> 03:51:57.067]  I think the wrong questions are being asked here.
[03:51:58.129 --> 03:52:00.771]  And I think that this is a perfect example.
[03:52:00.811 --> 03:52:05.053]  This is Exhibit A. Look, I feel bad for Mom.
[03:52:07.554 --> 03:52:19.922]  As a parent, I would never want to see any of my children harmed or hurt, killed, whether it's a legitimate kill situation or not.
[03:52:20.722 --> 03:52:23.964]  So I feel for that parent.
[03:52:24.995 --> 03:52:39.047]  But I think through all of this talk, as Owen has said before, the toxic masculinity and making being a man and being protective of one's family, making it almost a crime.
[03:52:39.607 --> 03:52:39.848]  Yeah.
[03:52:40.088 --> 03:52:41.089]  And this is what we get.
[03:52:41.489 --> 03:52:43.210]  So I wanted to make sure I covered that.
[03:52:44.409 --> 03:52:47.051]  They're demonizing this, and we covered this on the show yesterday.
[03:52:47.111 --> 03:52:56.317]  The article on Fox News, toxic masculinity, you know, is the problem for all the world's violence, and it adds to competitiveness and aggression.
[03:52:56.557 --> 03:53:00.700]  Things that men are supposed to have, and they are demonizing this.
[03:53:00.760 --> 03:53:14.149]  Meanwhile, they were pushing perversion on children, telling them they're able to be, you know, be a sex other than what they were born with, and any kind of attempt to, you know, rehabilitate that mindset is now a crime in California.
[03:53:14.549 --> 03:53:20.794]  But, you know, here they're saying men who are actual men who have testosterone, that is the real problem.
[03:53:20.894 --> 03:53:25.018]  And this is just the liberal lunacy being showcased front and center.
[03:53:25.258 --> 03:53:26.499]  I want to make sure we cover this.
[03:53:26.559 --> 03:53:31.223]  By the way, you like testosterone, go to InfoWarsStore.com and stock up.
[03:53:31.643 --> 03:53:33.625]  It's... Supermeal Vitality?
[03:53:33.645 --> 03:53:35.547]  That's right.
[03:53:35.907 --> 03:53:36.828]  Sorry, I had to do that.
[03:53:37.729 --> 03:53:38.710]  An important story.
[03:53:39.290 --> 03:53:41.531]  We saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week.
[03:53:41.911 --> 03:53:48.775]  She was not on the bench for the first time in 25 years, was not in chambers to hear arguments on a number of cases.
[03:53:48.795 --> 03:53:52.617]  Instead, she was receiving transcripts and working from home.
[03:53:52.938 --> 03:54:00.502]  But an interesting article from Politico today, Trump White House urging allies to prepare for possible departure of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:54:00.982 --> 03:54:09.549]  After an ailing Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg missed oral arguments, the Trump team began early groundwork for another presidential confirmation battle, or potential confirmation battle.
[03:54:09.929 --> 03:54:16.375]  And folks, pay attention to this, because obviously Ruth Bader Ginsburg has had a number of serious health-related issues over the past few years.
[03:54:16.615 --> 03:54:21.339]  She's 85 years old, I believe, and she had recently fallen and broken some ribs.
[03:54:21.679 --> 03:54:26.623]  She also had a cancerous growth removed from her neck twice now in the last 10 years.
[03:54:27.203 --> 03:54:36.805]  And when the Kavanaugh confirmation happened and I saw her there, she looked and reminded me of my grandma in the very last years of her life.
[03:54:36.885 --> 03:54:40.806]  I lived with my grandma and took care of her while she was sick and passed away.
[03:54:41.226 --> 03:54:43.487]  And Ruth Bader Ginsburg looks very similar to that.
[03:54:43.527 --> 03:54:46.047]  Very frail, very weak, almost anemic looking.
[03:54:46.647 --> 03:54:51.448]  And people who've taken care of elderly relatives who have passed away know what I'm talking about.
[03:54:51.488 --> 03:54:52.589]  Did you see that?
[03:54:52.729 --> 03:54:54.349]  And I'm sorry, look, I know.
[03:54:54.369 --> 03:54:54.669]  Go for it.
[03:54:56.431 --> 03:54:59.515]  But sometimes you gotta know when it's time to hang it up, okay?
[03:54:59.555 --> 03:55:00.376]  I mean, seriously.
[03:55:01.157 --> 03:55:01.858]  But that's the thing.
[03:55:01.938 --> 03:55:03.479]  Even if she was dead.
[03:55:04.401 --> 03:55:05.182]  Say she was dead.
[03:55:05.582 --> 03:55:11.329]  I mean, these people are not going to allow President Trump to have another pick before 2020.
[03:55:13.050 --> 03:55:14.530]  And how they'd get away with that, I don't know.
[03:55:14.690 --> 03:55:17.831]  But people are speculating, oh yeah, she's dead and they're just high.
[03:55:18.311 --> 03:55:19.511]  That's a very real chance.
[03:55:19.531 --> 03:55:20.171]  I don't know.
[03:55:20.311 --> 03:55:21.932]  I mean, would that be illegal?
[03:55:22.132 --> 03:55:22.452]  Maybe.
[03:55:22.552 --> 03:55:29.313]  But they're going to do everything in their power to make sure that Trump does not get another pick before the 2020 election.
[03:55:29.433 --> 03:55:35.034]  I got to tell you, I think that's going to be one of the few flashpoints in this powder keg that we're looking at.
[03:55:35.414 --> 03:55:40.815]  The election of not Merrick Garland to a Supreme Court after Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:55:41.355 --> 03:55:41.615]  Of course.
[03:55:58.925 --> 03:56:00.846]  You know, I mean, enough's enough.
[03:56:01.107 --> 03:56:01.767]  But go on, Joe.
[03:56:02.167 --> 03:56:03.008]  We got about a minute.
[03:56:03.028 --> 03:56:12.175]  No, that's just, um, that's something I'm keeping my eye on as, uh, you know, as just on the screen, you saw her with her head down, uh, you know, falling asleep.
[03:56:12.515 --> 03:56:19.020]  And she's also tried to say she was intoxicated a few times there, uh, you know, when she was on the bench or whatever.
[03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:21.382]  And she just does not look good.
[03:56:21.422 --> 03:56:22.342]  She does not look healthy.
[03:56:22.502 --> 03:56:23.964]  And I don't think she has long.
[03:56:23.984 --> 03:56:25.705]  But how long can the left hide it?
[03:56:25.805 --> 03:56:27.086]  How long can they prop her up?
[03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:33.074]  They're using her.
[03:56:33.234 --> 03:56:34.756]  They don't care about her.
[03:56:34.796 --> 03:56:35.717]  They're using her.
[03:56:36.498 --> 03:56:38.040]  It's all politics to them.
[03:56:38.060 --> 03:56:42.346]  They don't give a damn about her health or the humanity behind this.
[03:56:42.386 --> 03:56:43.368]  They're using her.
[03:56:43.808 --> 03:56:45.110]  And people on the left
[03:56:45.660 --> 03:56:46.601]  I can't see it.
[03:56:46.761 --> 03:56:48.001]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interject.
[03:56:48.081 --> 03:56:48.622]  No, no.
[03:56:49.262 --> 03:56:50.883]  We only got about one minute left.
[03:56:51.283 --> 03:56:54.225]  There's still so much going on in the world of news.
[03:56:54.565 --> 03:57:03.491]  I'm focused on looking to see who they plan on running in 2020 as far as a presidential contender against Trump on the Democratic side.
[03:57:03.731 --> 03:57:08.474]  We see a lot of polling and people are trying to throw their hat in the ring.
[03:57:08.494 --> 03:57:11.856]  Iowa, who was it, Beto O'Rourke.
[03:57:12.437 --> 03:57:12.877]  I don't
[03:57:29.650 --> 03:57:30.911]  God bless each and every one of you.
[03:57:30.931 --> 03:57:31.111]  Thank you.
[03:57:56.070 --> 03:58:07.975]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[03:58:08.996 --> 03:58:10.717]  This is where everybody's going.
[03:58:11.753 --> 03:58:14.175]  This is what your body actually needs.
[03:58:14.955 --> 03:58:26.103]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[03:58:26.723 --> 03:58:33.488]  Now obviously there's been a giant marijuana legalization craze that Soros has funded the last 10 years.
[03:58:34.108 --> 03:58:35.289]  I've not been involved in that.
[03:58:36.658 --> 03:58:37.379]  It's a huge bubble.
[03:58:37.759 --> 03:58:38.961]  This is not marijuana.
[03:58:39.061 --> 03:58:40.482]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[03:58:40.783 --> 03:58:50.474]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes but not the bad attributes that turn people into potheads in their basements picking and eating their boogers.
[03:58:51.435 --> 03:58:59.464]  This is the good CBD from the organic hemp oil and there are so many great products
