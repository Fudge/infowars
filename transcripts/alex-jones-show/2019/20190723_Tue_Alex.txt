[00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:34.991]  700 years before medieval Europe ever captured or shipped one black soul, one African, out of Africa.
[00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:38.995]  The Arabs had created the trade.
[00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:41.017]  They ran the trade.
[00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:52.889]  And they control the trade to this day where it's seen as a status symbol to have African slaves in your Haram, which is the god-like heaven zone that a lord lives in.
[00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.611]  Haram, the hidden, the secret, the heaven.
[00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:04.153]  And all over the world, the ultra-rich Islamists used to have black servants.
[00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:06.607]  They sell Africans over there.
[00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:08.248]  In Libya, they sell men.
[00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.708]  Even 15-year-old Libyans are there in a car.
[00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:11.309]  They're armed.
[00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.349]  They'll come and kidnap you, and they'll sell you for $70 to $150.
[00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.970]  And then others will resell you.
[00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:23.832]  As soon as you arrive in Libya, the first thing that happens is that you are taken away and sold.
[00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:29.634]  Like an animal, I was sold four times in open markets in Libya.
[00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:31.154]  The last time I was sold for $10,000.
[00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.054]  I was tortured every day.
[00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:47.108]  The worldwide hub for the slave trade all over the Pacific Ocean, starting 700 years before any blacks were sold by whites, was Somalia.
[00:01:48.009 --> 00:02:00.096]  And the light-skinned Arabs there did not allow their people to marry anyone from Kenya or the surrounding areas.
[00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:01.917]  They got slaves
[00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.927]  From as far away as Nigeria.
[00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:19.075]  I was discriminated against.
[00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:20.916]  I was considered a slave.
[00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:25.519]  It led me to no longer love to be there, forced to go.
[00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.161]  Because the Somalis always said that I was a Tanzanian.
[00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:39.167]  Well, what we're finding is that Libya is now a broken economy without any rule.
[00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:45.591]  It's got a very small population, 6 million people, and the size of Libya is twice the size of France.
[00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:50.874]  So it's a small population and they seem to be essentially living off the migrant trade.
[00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:56.177]  Migrants being passed from one to another, being exploited as labourers who don't get paid.
[00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:57.738]  Now, this is currently going on!
[00:02:57.758 --> 00:02:58.659]  Ilhan Omar is an Arab!
[00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:20.222]  And it talks about she is a god.
[00:03:20.703 --> 00:03:30.790]  You look up her name, it's one of the dominant families in Somalia that is known as royalty, basically, and known as rulers of humans.
[00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.651]  Or rulers of slaves.
[00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:34.392]  Piracy!
[00:03:34.492 --> 00:03:35.133]  Kidnapping!
[00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:36.174]  Black slavery!
[00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:37.094]  White slavery!
[00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:39.056]  She's a god!
[00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:42.418]  And she comes to rule you!
[00:03:42.978 --> 00:03:44.319]  And you will bow!
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.321]  You will hit that damn knee!
[00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:13.705]  Too sensitive for its citizens.
[00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:15.046]  Translation?
[00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:20.509]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:29.013]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:35.036]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security.
[00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:38.958]  But a low score means you can't rent a car or apply for visas.
[00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:42.540]  The Chinese government expects to make this system mandatory in 2020.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.682]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:52.024]  The Chinese government, as people probably know, has quite comprehensive.
[00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:59.948]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, they have caught deep state spies inside the White House stealing national security information.
[00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:00.909]  Things are about to explode.
[00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:10.575]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[00:05:16.852 --> 00:05:18.773]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:27.960]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.443]  You can also get the same Don't Tread on Me t-shirt that Chris Pratt was wearing.
[00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:42.950]  By purchasing these t-shirts, you're not only supporting your country and your president, but you're supporting me and helping make sure I can keep making these videos you love.
[00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:51.659]  They're only printing a limited supply of these t-shirts, so make sure you get yours right now at InfoWarsStore.com before they sell out.
[00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.862]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[00:05:54.882 --> 00:05:59.186]  Flawless victory.
[00:06:15.152 --> 00:06:15.772]  Big Brother.
[00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:17.533]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:18.054 --> 00:06:19.194]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.436]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:21.676 --> 00:06:23.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:28.040]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:44.562]  As I told you two and a half years ago, the White House was chopped full.
[00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:51.865]  Absolutely crammed to the gills with deep state operatives both from the neocon and the leftist globalist wings.
[00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:58.248]  They were spying on President Trump the entire time and leaking twisted information.
[00:06:59.508 --> 00:07:07.632]  They would take anything and everything Trump did and then leak the classified info but mix lies into it as well trying to derail the country.
[00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:13.967]  They engaged in shadow diplomacy, where they would know what the president's moves were going to be.
[00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:18.871]  That would be given to Barack Obama, to John Kerry, to Hillary Clinton, and others.
[00:07:18.931 --> 00:07:22.514]  Well, several of those spies have been discovered.
[00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:30.940]  A lot more of those spies are going to be discovered, and these documents are being released to Congress.
[00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:36.384]  This should be the top story in the nation.
[00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:45.533]  But of course, if you're not on Infowars.com or DrudgeReport.com or TheGatewayPundit.com, you're not going to hear anything about it.
[00:07:45.573 --> 00:07:54.655]  But the headline on Infowars.com is Deep State Spies Caught Stealing National Security Information from the White House.
[00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:56.556]  It's all completely illegal.
[00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:59.037]  It's like Sandy Berger snuck into the bubble.
[00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:10.513]  In the Capitol and went in and got classified information that exposed Bill Clinton and put it in his socks and got caught because he wanted it out of there.
[00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:12.014]  There was only one copy.
[00:08:12.574 --> 00:08:14.235]  He was afraid someone would read it.
[00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:19.718]  Well, he barely even served any time for that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:20.278 --> 00:08:22.219]  So that's the type of things they're up to.
[00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.859]  And it's cut and dry illegal.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.942]  And the word is three different federal grand juries are hearing
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.683]  The evidence for indictment and the word is the indictments are going to be handed down.
[00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:41.026]  James Comey, of course, gave the order illegally and nothing criminal was found.
[00:08:41.266 --> 00:08:49.731]  But the act of stealing the classified data and the act of putting a spy in the White House totally violates the separation of powers that shows a rogue agency.
[00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:55.875]  I'm going to be covering this at the bottom of the hour in detail with the documents, the names, the facts.
[00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:57.376]  We've got them all right here.
[00:08:58.626 --> 00:09:18.300]  We're going to go over those and I'm also waiting on a phone call that I'm going to be taking during the next break with more information on this because I was told about this not just two and a half years ago but obviously we've been breaking that down and we have some good sources that are going to tell us exactly who the other indictments are going to be of reportedly.
[00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:25.845]  So this is a big, big, big deal and we'll be looking at all of it coming up at the bottom
[00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:28.828]  20 minutes from now.
[00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:33.949]  Here's what else we've got for you today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.010]  AOC, U.S.
[00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:44.652]  must have lifelong commitment to migrant children, health care services for life.
[00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:47.152]  That's right.
[00:09:47.752 --> 00:09:48.633]  You heard that right.
[00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.393]  She says they're victims of concentration camps.
[00:09:51.413 --> 00:09:52.593]  They're made to drink out of toilets.
[00:09:53.154 --> 00:09:54.374]  They've been so abused.
[00:09:55.199 --> 00:10:00.044]  That they need free services and psychological services for life, she told the London Guardian.
[00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:05.830]  Now, you've seen hundreds of lawsuits filed, all asking for $3 million.
[00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:20.425]  If children were separated for even an hour from their parents while it was verified who they were with, or if the living conditions weren't the Ritz-Carlton, supposedly, three million a piece of taxpayer money.
[00:10:20.985 --> 00:10:34.873]  You see, when you come here to get free stuff and you bring your kids across dangerous deserts and pay smugglers to do it, and a lot of them aren't their parents, they use them to mule drugs across, how do you turn that around when you're a criminal group engaging in crime?
[00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:36.925]  And sucking off people.
[00:10:37.305 --> 00:10:38.205]  And endangering your children.
[00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:40.787]  Many times, not even your children.
[00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:43.168]  Well, you turn around and say, concentration camps!
[00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:46.110]  And we deserve more free stuff for the rest of our lives!
[00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:58.518]  Well, Tlaib, we'll play a clip in a moment, the Islamic congresswoman from Detroit, the burnout rebel of that once great city, she's saying that everyone deserves $20 an hour.
[00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:11.467]  Even though Bernie Tandith had to lay off a lot of his employees or a lot of his campaign people or cut them from 60 hours to 43 hours because they demanded to go from $13 an hour to...
[00:11:14.998 --> 00:11:27.663]  $15 an hour, but Sanders was paying them time and a half, and so they had to get the extra 20 hours cut, because time and a half for 13 is obviously a lot of money, but time and a half for 15 is even more.
[00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:29.964]  So he's learning about economics.
[00:11:29.984 --> 00:11:30.925]  He's never run a business.
[00:11:30.945 --> 00:11:36.147]  He's swindled colleges and has $3 million-plus homes and drives $118,000 cars.
[00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:36.687]  I actually looked it up.
[00:11:39.268 --> 00:11:39.368]  $118,000 car.
[00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:42.670]  I've never had a $100,000 car.
[00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:50.854]  I mean, this is just all going on here, but he's going to tell you that you've got to hire people for $15 an hour.
[00:11:50.914 --> 00:11:53.675]  Now, in New York, you pretty much need that.
[00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:57.998]  Not in South Texas.
[00:11:58.538 --> 00:12:02.180]  The owner of the little hot dog shack doesn't make $15 an hour.
[00:12:05.353 --> 00:12:06.574]  It's just insane.
[00:12:06.654 --> 00:12:09.617]  So here's Tlaib offering more free stuff.
[00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:13.520]  Free housing, free transportation, free education, free health care.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.781]  Free, free, free.
[00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:15.281]  And now, $20.
[00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:16.262]  Here it is.
[00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:16.262]  $2.13?
[00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:22.708]  As a tip to place, $2.13 per hour, federally.
[00:12:22.728 --> 00:12:28.893]  Some state courts here in Michigan put $2.50 or so.
[00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:33.056]  But think about that for one minute.
[00:12:34.297 --> 00:12:37.079]  People cannot live on those kinds of wages.
[00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:42.963]  And we can't allow people to be living off of, somehow relying on tipped wages.
[00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:46.285]  It's just not, or whatever they call it, tipped income.
[00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:49.267]  Because it's just not enough to support our families.
[00:12:49.347 --> 00:12:51.529]  But I also want to always tell a story because
[00:12:52.273 --> 00:12:53.374]  Okay, I can't listen anymore to this.
[00:12:53.414 --> 00:13:04.944]  You heard her say $20, which again, when you add in all the taxes and the regulations and the social security, somebody being paid $20 an hour is being paid like $26, $27 an hour.
[00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:09.869]  Nobody can pay that in your average retail shop or wherever.
[00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:14.273]  A lot of times, little retail shops aren't selling but a couple hundred dollars of things an hour.
[00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:22.500]  How do you pay for the lights, the regulations, the insurance, the rent, or the property taxes, and the employees?
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.860]  It's insane.
[00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:28.403]  The New York Times says we need a $33 an hour.
[00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:30.904]  Do you know what inflation will do if they did that too?
[00:13:31.564 --> 00:13:33.485]  Again, this would sink the economy.
[00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:36.527]  You know what the average wage in China is, right?
[00:13:36.547 --> 00:13:37.527]  It's $2 an hour.
[00:13:38.287 --> 00:13:39.208]  How are we going to compete?
[00:13:40.503 --> 00:13:46.106]  With Mexico that's got less than $2 an hour being the average wage.
[00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:48.507]  Well, the answer is you're not going to do it.
[00:13:48.987 --> 00:13:52.129]  And the country is going to go belly up, which is the Democrats' plan.
[00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:58.632]  Cloward and Piven is to wreck the economy to be able to completely and totally, absolutely take it over.
[00:13:59.092 --> 00:14:02.433]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and get more into this.
[00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:09.597]  But the idea that you get here and you're entitled to free stuff for life because you're a victim, it's like slave reparations.
[00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:24.982]  But then meanwhile, Ilhan Omar comes from the upper caste, elite tribe of Somalis, whose specialty is slavery to this day, but only of sub-human blacks they have a name for.
[00:14:25.722 --> 00:14:31.127]  We just played in the first segment, if you missed it, documentaries with black Africans from Kenya.
[00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:35.021]  Uh, who by the way on average have higher IQs than Somalis.
[00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:36.643]  I looked it up and they're stronger and everything else.
[00:14:36.823 --> 00:14:43.028]  But of course they're saying they're subhuman, uh, when if you look at all the African tribes, the Kenyans are pretty noble folks.
[00:14:43.869 --> 00:14:45.190]  Uh, definitely compared to the Somalis.
[00:14:45.831 --> 00:14:51.376]  Uh, so it's just amazing inversion of reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:52.577 --> 00:14:55.980]  Absolute inversion of reality.
[00:14:57.369 --> 00:15:00.190]  So that's all coming up today and so much more.
[00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.251]  Please do not forget, we got DNA Force Plus back in stock.
[00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:16.335]  It is the strongest PQQ, CoQ10, Resital, just all of the things that are award-winning, all the things that are seen as the very best out there.
[00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:17.755]  It's in there.
[00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:28.294]  Elv ATP, that's the ingredient of the year, by the Nutri-Ingredients Awards Conference, increases cellular energy levels, improves athletic performance.
[00:15:28.334 --> 00:15:31.776]  CoQ10, PQQ, and it just goes on and on.
[00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:43.702]  Astragalus, Reishi mushroom, R, alpha lipoic acid, rhodiola, I mean, I just can't go over all this, folks.
[00:15:47.352 --> 00:15:47.992]  Cordyceps.
[00:15:48.693 --> 00:15:49.293]  Sinuses.
[00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:55.056]  It's the best of the best for your cells, for your body, for your brain.
[00:15:55.617 --> 00:15:59.479]  It's DNA Force Plus 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:08.609]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:09.410]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.850]  You're on the air.
[00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:10.411]  Hey, Alex.
[00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:14.654]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[00:16:14.754 --> 00:16:17.216]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:18.918]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:22.541]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:23.882]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:16:23.962 --> 00:16:24.362]  Exactly.
[00:16:24.382 --> 00:16:25.363]  We're all kindred spirits.
[00:16:25.543 --> 00:16:26.043]  We really are.
[00:16:26.063 --> 00:16:26.523]  We really are.
[00:16:26.543 --> 00:16:28.224]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[00:16:28.244 --> 00:16:30.904]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:33.324]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:34.425]  What would you recommend?
[00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:37.245]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:39.106]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:42.566]  You know, I think X2 or X3, because that's a building block to everything.
[00:16:42.586 --> 00:16:44.347]  And if you don't have that, the bad allergens take over.
[00:16:44.387 --> 00:16:46.607]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:47.927]  Turmeric is amazing.
[00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:49.468]  This is a very strong extract.
[00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:50.628]  One of the strongest out there.
[00:16:50.648 --> 00:16:51.948]  Probably the strongest, but there may be ones
[00:16:54.241 --> 00:16:56.603]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:16:56.763 --> 00:17:00.746]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:13.636]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[00:17:13.676 --> 00:17:21.722]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[00:17:21.782 --> 00:17:22.383]  That's it.
[00:17:22.443 --> 00:17:23.864]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again,
[00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:25.626]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[00:17:26.406 --> 00:17:27.388]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:29.350]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.451]  You've got my total commitment.
[00:17:30.691 --> 00:17:37.679]  Anything I do, information, any of it, products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[00:17:37.819 --> 00:17:39.181]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:43.405]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:44.687]  Why'd I do that?
[00:17:44.827 --> 00:17:46.348]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[00:17:46.428 --> 00:17:49.651]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality.
[00:17:49.671 --> 00:17:52.894]  Because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better.
[00:17:52.974 --> 00:17:55.997]  But I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit?
[00:17:56.097 --> 00:17:57.398]  And that's what I promote.
[00:17:57.518 --> 00:17:59.279]  So that's my advice on that.
[00:17:59.399 --> 00:17:59.900]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.604]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[00:18:06.664 --> 00:18:08.585]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:10.126]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:12.928]  Well, listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal.
[00:18:13.168 --> 00:18:14.469]  You need to talk to a physician.
[00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:17.390]  You need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.071]  Most people have almost none of it.
[00:18:19.091 --> 00:18:22.193]  But if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you can have some issues.
[00:18:22.353 --> 00:18:23.514]  Detoxing, you name it.
[00:18:23.554 --> 00:18:26.216]  I mean, this stuff, this is it, man.
[00:18:26.376 --> 00:18:27.776]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:18:27.897 --> 00:18:28.537]  It's dangerous.
[00:18:28.737 --> 00:18:31.438]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[00:18:31.499 --> 00:18:33.360]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.100]  You've got to be careful.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.982]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[00:18:38.082 --> 00:18:39.603]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[00:18:40.783 --> 00:18:42.304]  Your organs, everything operates.
[00:18:42.504 --> 00:18:44.666]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:48.368]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[00:18:48.448 --> 00:18:49.388]  So this is the good thing.
[00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:52.390]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the head by a mule.
[00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.670]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.591]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[00:18:54.711 --> 00:18:56.612]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[00:18:56.732 --> 00:18:58.374]  We just researched what the globalists are doing.
[00:18:58.554 --> 00:18:59.335]  We do the opposite.
[00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:05.021]  But yes, everyone with X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:06.123]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[00:19:06.223 --> 00:19:10.127]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[00:19:10.147 --> 00:19:11.028]  So I'm gonna explain it again.
[00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:21.438]  Most iodine is bound to iron, copper, or lead, or something else.
[00:19:21.478 --> 00:19:22.319]  You don't get it.
[00:19:22.419 --> 00:19:25.042]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[00:19:25.322 --> 00:19:26.323]  So yeah, be careful.
[00:19:26.503 --> 00:19:27.785]  Iodine, you have to have.
[00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:30.266]  It's just paramount.
[00:19:30.846 --> 00:19:32.707]  And so, that's why we sell it.
[00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:36.288]  That's why we've hyped it up, because it's what they don't want you to have.
[00:19:36.328 --> 00:19:41.190]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring.
[00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.592]  And you get in the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.173]  Because you've never had it.
[00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:48.253]  It's just iodine.
[00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:50.054]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:52.835]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:52.855 --> 00:19:57.537]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products, and it helps fund this operation a total 360.
[00:19:58.257 --> 00:19:59.658]  You win, and you know I love those.
[00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:16.597]  Big Brother.
[00:20:17.038 --> 00:20:18.259]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.941]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:20.742 --> 00:20:22.163]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:22.423 --> 00:20:23.604]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:28.750]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:15.343]  There are camps and people are being concentrated.
[00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:16.563]  This is very simple.
[00:21:16.643 --> 00:21:20.284]  I don't even know why this is a controversial thing for her to say.
[00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:31.688]  We have to really truthfully speak about what's taking place and this is why it's really important for us to abolish ICE and make sure that we have an agency that is accountable to the people, that is
[00:21:32.228 --> 00:21:35.411]  We're dealing with the situation in a humane way.
[00:21:37.132 --> 00:21:50.404]  There's no way that we can allow for kids to be caged in this country and children to be separated from their families and people being terrorized in their communities.
[00:21:50.424 --> 00:21:52.105]  Is it fair to the community?
[00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:54.988]  We have to make sure that we are calling it out and I am 100% with Alex.
[00:22:12.702 --> 00:22:14.103]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:22:14.623 --> 00:22:18.024]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:22.165]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:28.007]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:22:28.367 --> 00:22:39.111]  You wanna Trump?
[00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:40.151]  You wanna Trump?
[00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:41.092]  Yeah!
[00:22:41.392 --> 00:22:42.212]  Who are the presidents?
[00:22:45.750 --> 00:23:08.022]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:20.777]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border.
[00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:25.359]  And that is exactly what they are.
[00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.139]  They are concentration camps.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:34.422]  And if that doesn't bother you, I don't
[00:23:39.114 --> 00:23:41.356]  I like, we can have, okay, whatever.
[00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:50.023]  I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that we should not, that never again mean something.
[00:23:50.563 --> 00:24:06.636]  And that the fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing.
[00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:11.213]  And we need to do something about it.
[00:24:12.214 --> 00:24:25.305]  This week, immigrant children were moved to the same internment camps where the Japanese were held in the earlier 20th century.
[00:24:25.326 --> 00:24:32.072]  And this is not even about a crisis for—this is not just about
[00:24:33.593 --> 00:24:38.974]  The immigrant communities being held in concentration camps being a crisis.
[00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:40.594]  This is a crisis for ourselves.
[00:24:40.634 --> 00:24:56.738]  This is a crisis on if America will remain America in its actual principles and values, or if we are losing to an authoritarian and fascist presidency.
[00:24:57.298 --> 00:24:58.398]  And so I think that that is
[00:25:00.563 --> 00:25:02.405]  You know, I don't use those words lightly.
[00:25:02.425 --> 00:25:07.969]  I don't use those words to just throw bombs.
[00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:14.454]  I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is.
[00:25:15.455 --> 00:25:22.721]  A presidency that creates concentration camps is fascist.
[00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:28.945]  It's very difficult to say that.
[00:25:29.505 --> 00:25:32.207]  This is what organizing looks like.
[00:25:32.968 --> 00:25:35.610]  This is what building power looks like.
[00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.832]  This is what changing the country looks like.
[00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:46.979]  It's when we choose to show up and occupy the room and talk about the things that matter most, talking about our future.
[00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:53.363]  You know, Reverend, you bring up a funny anecdote, and I'm proud to be a bartender.
[00:25:54.784 --> 00:25:56.145]  Ain't nothing wrong with that.
[00:25:56.165 --> 00:26:02.049]  There's nothing wrong with working retail folding clothes for other people to buy.
[00:26:02.069 --> 00:26:09.735]  There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors... Hey guys, did you hear the news?
[00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:16.760]  Guardians of the Galaxy is cancelled because the lead actor Chris Pratt wore a really insensitive shirt.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.523]  Now I have to warn you before I show it to you that viewer discretion is advised.
[00:26:21.823 --> 00:26:22.424]  Are you ready?
[00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:26.965]  Okay, that was scary.
[00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:44.152]  So last week, Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt was walking around town with his wife, being normal human beings, when a crazed paparazzi decided to take a photo of the two of them.
[00:26:44.693 --> 00:26:56.400]  And somehow, for some reason I can't comprehend, this photo of him holding a water bottle in one hand and his wife in the other turned into one of the biggest stories of the week on the internet.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:56.941]  Why?
[00:26:57.561 --> 00:26:58.722]  Well, let's look closer.
[00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:00.483]  Look at that shirt.
[00:27:01.023 --> 00:27:01.624]  That's right.
[00:27:01.924 --> 00:27:07.448]  It was his shirt of all things that caused a huge controversy online and sent leftists into a panic.
[00:27:07.748 --> 00:27:15.674]  A t-shirt of an American flag with the words don't tread on me, which by the way you can get right now at Infowarsstore.com for only $17.76.
[00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:21.438]  This t-shirt made liberals all over Twitter call him the forbidden r-word.
[00:27:21.838 --> 00:27:29.122]  It even led to Yahoo News publishing a full-blown hit piece on Pratt and accused him of wearing a white SuperSauce shirt.
[00:27:29.402 --> 00:27:33.224]  We have to say SuperSauce or the YouTube gods don't come after us.
[00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:34.765]  Just look at this headline.
[00:27:35.365 --> 00:27:38.567]  Chris Pratt criticized for white SuperSauce t-shirt.
[00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:45.150]  This article was so bad that they had to change the headline to Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[00:27:45.450 --> 00:28:00.618]  In fact, they even included an update at the top of the article that says, this article was updated on 17 July with the initial headline, Chris Pratt criticized for white super sauce t-shirt, being amended to Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[00:28:01.238 --> 00:28:05.061]  References to White Supersauce in this article have been removed.
[00:28:05.361 --> 00:28:09.704]  But that didn't stop Yahoo from publishing another article that same day.
[00:28:09.964 --> 00:28:15.147]  Chris Pratt is in hot water for this controversial t-shirt, and the internet has thoughts.
[00:28:15.347 --> 00:28:20.071]  This article, by the way, has plenty of references to White Supersauce.
[00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:21.111]  The article reads,
[00:28:31.118 --> 00:28:31.939]  Yeah, we'll go with that.
[00:28:31.959 --> 00:28:32.719]  Who adds a swaffle to a...
[00:28:51.377 --> 00:29:01.212]  So when Pratt was spotted wearing a shirt with the Gadsden design, some people quickly drew a parallel between Pratt's wardrobe choice and the less positive...
[00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:18.741]  Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta tell ya, the InfoWars Live Protein Bars are really popular around the InfoWars office.
[00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:21.963]  I mean, people around here cannot get enough of them.
[00:29:21.983 --> 00:29:22.743]  I'm telling you.
[00:29:23.123 --> 00:29:24.724]  In fact, myself included.
[00:29:25.004 --> 00:29:28.847]  Let me just show you why the InfoWars Live Protein Bar is so popular, man.
[00:29:29.147 --> 00:29:32.549]  This thing is like a double fudge brownie.

[00:30:03.473 --> 00:30:16.640]  Imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago that in the future universities would be saying, don't use the term America or American, and that American flags would be seen as offensive, and that federal courts would be ruling that it's a hate symbol.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:17.981]  That's all happening.
[00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:20.742]  The left are fascist authoritarians.
[00:30:21.022 --> 00:30:21.602]  They're bullies.
[00:30:21.642 --> 00:30:22.223]  They're criminals.
[00:30:22.903 --> 00:30:25.524]  And now they're trying to make us take down the American flag.
[00:30:25.544 --> 00:30:29.666]  They said the Betsy Ross flag, our original flag, is evil when she was an abolitionist.
[00:30:30.006 --> 00:30:35.449]  But people are fighting back in this symbol war, in this information war, at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:43.975]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:45.377]  A true 360 win.

[00:33:16.841 --> 00:33:18.987]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:19.488 --> 00:33:24.620]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:26.141 --> 00:33:27.822]  Okay, here's what's going on.
[00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:30.624]  I'm gonna be back live next hour.
[00:33:30.804 --> 00:33:34.906]  I'm working on a big story right here, and I've got to make some phone calls.
[00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:41.571]  And this is some big stuff about the latest attempted coup against the president and against the country.
[00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:50.376]  And then Lord Monckton's gonna be joining us as well with big new developments exposing the fact that they know man-made global warming and climate change is a fraud.
[00:33:50.416 --> 00:33:53.998]  Of course, we already know that, but a bunch of major studies, a bunch of big admissions.
[00:33:54.338 --> 00:33:54.539]  That's
[00:33:55.379 --> 00:33:57.840]  But I'll be coming up as well today.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.101]  But I don't normally air something over and over and over again.
[00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.421]  But I've aired this already three times.
[00:34:04.441 --> 00:34:05.322]  I'm going to air it again.
[00:34:05.402 --> 00:34:12.404]  It's Professor Robert Epstein, who's a psychologist and runs big computer science programs, works with DARPA, you name it.
[00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:17.145]  He testified, as you know, last week that Google's already stealing the election, along with Facebook.
[00:34:17.165 --> 00:34:21.806]  And if it doesn't get stopped, we will see the election stolen in 2020.
[00:34:22.646 --> 00:34:24.307]  So this is a paramount issue.
[00:34:25.419 --> 00:34:40.327]  And then next hour, I am going to start the hour off getting into the espionage and the spies caught inside the White House and really how deep all of that goes.
[00:34:41.608 --> 00:34:42.469]  So we'll be back.
[00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:49.092]  I'll be back live next hour with all of that information.
[00:34:50.293 --> 00:34:51.854]  And we're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:34:51.874 --> 00:34:52.674]  It's very, very important.
[00:34:52.714 --> 00:34:53.415]  So please stay with us.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:03.910]  Google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016.
[00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.732]  Is that correct?
[00:35:06.073 --> 00:35:09.576]  2.6 million is a rock-bottom minimum.
[00:35:10.297 --> 00:35:21.061]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:25.803]  They control these, and no one can counteract them.
[00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:27.544]  These are not competitive.
[00:35:28.304 --> 00:35:33.066]  These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:41.193]  Your testimony is that Google is, through bias in search results, manipulating voters.
[00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.529]  In a way they're not aware of.
[00:35:44.549 --> 00:36:00.744]  On a massive scale, in 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.
[00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:05.809]  Without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing.
[00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.289]  And in 2020?
[00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:28.202]  You can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out, and the methods that they're using are invisible, they're subliminal, they're more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences, and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years.
[00:36:28.762 --> 00:36:37.426]  A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, collectively.
[00:36:38.526 --> 00:36:43.069]  Massively influencing the results of elections.
[00:36:43.469 --> 00:36:45.670]  Senator, with respect, I must correct you.
[00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:46.030]  Please.
[00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:53.174]  If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go-vote reminder just to Democrats on Election Day, that doesn't cost him a dime.
[00:36:55.055 --> 00:37:02.799]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.080]  Translation?
[00:37:04.895 --> 00:37:09.557]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[00:37:09.757 --> 00:37:18.061]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:24.084]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting a house or skipping airport security.
[00:37:24.304 --> 00:37:28.026]  But a low score means you can't rent a car or apply for visas.
[00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:32.548]  The Chinese government expects to make this system mandatory in 2020.
[00:37:32.608 --> 00:37:36.750]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:46.054]  The Chinese government, as people probably know, has a quite comprehensive internet censorship system set up and it's known as the Great Firewall.
[00:37:46.114 --> 00:37:53.337]  It blocks all kinds of information about, you know, political opponents of the ruling Communist Party regime there.
[00:37:53.557 --> 00:37:55.358]  All kinds of things that they're blocking out.
[00:37:55.538 --> 00:38:02.125]  Companies agreed to ban particular sites or search times on topics like human rights, democracy, and free speech.
[00:38:02.406 --> 00:38:04.188]  You know Google's really the CIA.
[00:38:05.555 --> 00:38:11.297]  But it's leftist run now, so it's run over to China, and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:19.899]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:26.461]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:27.841]  We'd never know what happened.
[00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:37.366]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:38:37.406 --> 00:38:39.167]  That's according to website Infowars.
[00:38:39.247 --> 00:38:50.113]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[00:38:50.153 --> 00:38:53.595]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government.
[00:38:54.455 --> 00:39:02.358]  It's sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government, but we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[00:39:02.539 --> 00:39:03.139]  Not a big deal.
[00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:07.821]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there, but I think we should be worrying.
[00:39:07.941 --> 00:39:08.621]  And it's all true!
[00:39:08.641 --> 00:39:14.443]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[00:39:14.964 --> 00:39:20.406]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:25.031]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[00:39:25.411 --> 00:39:29.395]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[00:39:29.776 --> 00:39:35.462]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[00:39:36.022 --> 00:39:37.704]  Give me a break.
[00:39:37.984 --> 00:39:40.405]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[00:39:40.546 --> 00:39:51.972]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[00:39:54.674 --> 00:40:06.940]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:16.285]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:40:16.425 --> 00:40:26.348]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:40:26.488 --> 00:40:29.409]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone?
[00:40:29.429 --> 00:40:34.571]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook?
[00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:45.034]  But if you're the Chinese government, and you want access to every citizen and all their data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product,
[00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:47.115]  Good to go, baby.
[00:40:48.116 --> 00:40:48.636]  Good to go.
[00:40:49.417 --> 00:40:52.359]  And the left in America loves it.
[00:40:59.104 --> 00:41:05.609]  We're gonna move to the east, to the horn of Africa and Somalia, the most dangerous, backward, evil country in the world.
[00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.671]  And you know why Somalia's so bad?
[00:41:09.152 --> 00:41:15.217]  Because African countries all around it have driven the Arab slavers.
[00:41:16.539 --> 00:41:26.541]  In the last thousand years, the Muslim slavers into the Horn of Africa, where it was the center of the slave trade of Africans all over the world.
[00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:30.182]  Once the Roman Empire fell, white slaves were the main slave group.
[00:41:30.302 --> 00:41:35.443]  Africans that were rich had white slaves, which is because that's who was trained and where they got slaves was Gaul.
[00:41:35.543 --> 00:41:36.603]  That's France today.
[00:41:36.843 --> 00:41:39.464]  Germania, which is Austria and Germany.
[00:41:39.804 --> 00:41:44.588]  The British and others, who they called Gaelic, out of, what's the UK today?
[00:41:44.808 --> 00:41:46.429]  Old Albion, England.
[00:41:46.649 --> 00:41:57.017]  But after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Western Empire, then the fall of the Eastern Empire, Constantinople, when the Islamists took it, civilization collapsed in Western Europe.
[00:41:57.077 --> 00:41:59.819]  And there wasn't any good slaves being brought in anymore.
[00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:02.842]  And so the Muslims started enslaving
[00:42:04.262 --> 00:42:05.023]  Africans.
[00:42:05.543 --> 00:42:07.304]  Over a thousand years ago.
[00:42:07.544 --> 00:42:10.445]  And that's why Ilhan Omar doesn't look African.
[00:42:10.505 --> 00:42:12.546]  She's an elite Somali.
[00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:15.448]  The upper-class Somalis are light-skinned.
[00:42:15.588 --> 00:42:19.009]  They are Muslims, and they are slave traffickers.
[00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.432]  They sell black slaves today to four countries that still allow slavery.
[00:42:23.592 --> 00:42:26.853]  It's still customary in several Arab countries to have black house slaves.
[00:42:27.073 --> 00:42:28.094]  That's the truth, folks.
[00:42:28.294 --> 00:42:29.595]  That's what they don't want you to know.
[00:42:29.615 --> 00:42:31.738]  I bet you a lot of money she comes from slavers.
[00:42:32.118 --> 00:42:39.346]  And you're literally looking at someone that comes from the hub of a thousand years of black slavery.
[00:42:39.526 --> 00:42:43.871]  Ilhan Omar, guaranteed in her lineage, is pure slaver.
[00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:48.876]  They ship slaves out of Somalia all the way to Indonesia.
[00:42:49.036 --> 00:43:01.303]  And then as you project out towards the east, to the far east, you will see all the islands and countries they've taken over in the last thousand years since Islam, 1400 years ago, went expansionist.
[00:43:04.056 --> 00:43:07.220]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot Points.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:07.580]  I did.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.845]  I've gotten $180 so far this year in Patriot Points, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:15.529]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:18.733]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:19.974]  So I'd rather give that money to
[00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:21.936]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[00:43:21.956 --> 00:43:23.878]  I've never really done marketing, but I did
[00:43:41.093 --> 00:43:45.435]  Bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[00:43:45.455 --> 00:43:47.956]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[00:43:48.096 --> 00:43:50.797]  And I said, 150%, but we always discount 25%.
[00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:51.757]  So that's 100%.
[00:43:51.797 --> 00:43:54.519]  And they said, yeah, and then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:57.360]  And then we noticed you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.661]  And then you're barely making any money.
[00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:01.002]  You need to stop that.
[00:44:01.082 --> 00:44:04.104]  And they looked at our data, and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[00:44:04.124 --> 00:44:05.825]  And I said, I want high-quality stuff in there.
[00:44:06.285 --> 00:44:07.086]  I want a good price.
[00:44:07.606 --> 00:44:13.289]  But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this, to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.011]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:18.593]  Because there's no fillers, it's concentrated, it's got iodine, a little silver.
[00:44:18.753 --> 00:44:22.276]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth.
[00:44:22.376 --> 00:44:25.939]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that.
[00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:28.861]  So I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:31.883]  It's still got 30-something dollars of product in it.
[00:44:31.943 --> 00:44:36.805]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out, you talk about energy stamina, you talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[00:44:36.945 --> 00:44:38.305]  This is patented to do that.
[00:44:38.505 --> 00:44:41.706]  And nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[00:44:41.786 --> 00:44:43.667]  So yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:44.747]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:48.849]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[00:44:48.969 --> 00:44:57.471]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[00:44:57.491 --> 00:44:58.072]  But that's okay.
[00:44:58.112 --> 00:44:58.732]  Thanks for the support.
[00:45:04.227 --> 00:45:05.948]  Laura in Alabama.
[00:45:06.028 --> 00:45:07.009]  Laura, you're on the air.
[00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.349]  Go ahead.
[00:45:34.087 --> 00:45:34.487]  Thank you, everybody.
[00:45:34.507 --> 00:45:39.771]  And everyone who wants to see this info war actually happen, have to put their money where their mouth is.
[00:45:39.851 --> 00:45:43.133]  So I ask everyone right now to go online and order some products.
[00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:47.163]  Well, thank you for your kind words, because take that wound gel.
[00:45:47.203 --> 00:45:48.984]  We're the only other company in the U.S.
[00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:53.247]  that has licensed it from the Colorado company that's very famous, that has FDA approval.
[00:45:53.407 --> 00:46:06.315]  It's used in hospitals, it's sold in pharmacies, and then we private label it as silver wound gel, which is a pre-gel, tiny bit, covers your hands, everything, and then disinfects all day long, or put it on once you have a cut or something.
[00:46:06.355 --> 00:46:09.777]  Now, it's so super strong, you can't take it internally, or it's poisonous.
[00:46:09.957 --> 00:46:13.921]  But yes, it is the strongest FDA over-the-counter silver there is.
[00:46:13.981 --> 00:46:15.422]  So, that is one of our best sellers.
[00:46:15.462 --> 00:46:16.383]  People absolutely love it.
[00:46:16.564 --> 00:46:16.884]  Thank you.
[00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:19.567]  And I can tell you this, my neighbor burned his finger a little bit.
[00:46:19.587 --> 00:46:23.130]  We're building a fire outside, and I ran inside and got it and put it on his finger.
[00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:25.613]  And he said to me, is this supposed to work instantly?
[00:46:25.733 --> 00:46:26.333]  And like this?
[00:46:26.514 --> 00:46:27.615]  And I said, yep, sure does.
[00:46:27.715 --> 00:46:29.517]  So, it's fantastic stuff.
[00:46:29.577 --> 00:46:30.437]  I highly recommend it.
[00:46:33.137 --> 00:46:42.679]  Sometimes in life, your pipes just get a little clogged up, a little backed up, and you just can't get that clearance and that push that you need.
[00:46:43.299 --> 00:46:49.860]  But with Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com, that will no longer be an issue.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.761]  But watch out, because this stuff is powerful.
[00:46:54.361 --> 00:47:00.562]  Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com clears those pipes that have been giving you all that backup.
[00:47:06.458 --> 00:47:10.983]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.676 --> 00:47:29.962]  Live, raw, and unfiltered, it's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.136 --> 00:47:34.778]  I hope all the viewers and listeners understand something.
[00:47:36.138 --> 00:47:36.859]  But I think you do.
[00:47:36.899 --> 00:47:37.699]  You've got discernment.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:38.980]  I don't have a filter.
[00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:41.381]  What you see on air is who I am.
[00:47:41.401 --> 00:47:43.343]  I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[00:47:44.323 --> 00:47:45.764]  I'm super pissed at myself.
[00:47:47.265 --> 00:47:52.148]  I'm angry at what I've done the last year or so.
[00:47:53.689 --> 00:47:55.850]  Because, well let me just explain it.
[00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:21.284]  When I take the supplements that we sell that are the highest quality, best researched, that are all the missing links of nutrition that the globalists have by design imposed on us, so that we are deficient, so that we are dumbed down, so that we are weak, so that we are lethargic, and I myself preach that we should be healthy and prepared, and then I don't do it.
[00:48:22.925 --> 00:48:23.786]  I'm not as healthy.
[00:48:24.947 --> 00:48:25.787]  People notice that.
[00:48:26.147 --> 00:48:28.349]  And then I'm not promoting it as much.
[00:48:29.693 --> 00:48:31.254]  Instead, I'm just saying, support us.
[00:48:31.534 --> 00:48:32.674]  Get the products.
[00:48:32.714 --> 00:48:33.995]  That's how we fund our operation.
[00:48:35.395 --> 00:48:36.256]  That's secondary.
[00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:50.242]  If I'm bringing you the best products, like DNA Force Plus I'm about to break down, then it's going to work great for you, and you're going to want to reorder it, which is a 360 win, a symbiotic relationship, a non-zero-sum game.
[00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:52.442]  And I know the problems.
[00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:53.463]  I've talked about it before.
[00:48:54.915 --> 00:48:57.697]  Almost eight years ago, I was 80 plus pounds overweight.
[00:48:57.757 --> 00:49:01.661]  I was exercising every day, but all the chemicals, the environment, I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:49:02.101 --> 00:49:03.042]  I went on X2.
[00:49:03.062 --> 00:49:10.888]  I went on the first key products that we promoted that we knew were the best out there, and the weight just poured off of me.
[00:49:11.429 --> 00:49:12.810]  But then over the years, I get busy.
[00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:13.570]  I'm working hard.
[00:49:14.311 --> 00:49:16.012]  I run out of the vitamins and the minerals.
[00:49:16.052 --> 00:49:17.493]  I don't have an auto ship set up.
[00:49:18.394 --> 00:49:20.316]  And that I'm lethargic.
[00:49:20.896 --> 00:49:21.717]  I'm not working out.
[00:49:21.777 --> 00:49:24.019]  The same thing happens again, especially as you get older.
[00:49:24.699 --> 00:49:29.343]  Show, about three weeks ago, I religiously began to take X2 every morning.
[00:49:29.643 --> 00:49:31.564]  I religiously began to take Fishol every morning.
[00:49:31.865 --> 00:49:36.168]  I religiously began at lunch to take my DNA Force Plus that's so critical.
[00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:43.314]  And I've already lost seven pounds as of yesterday.
[00:49:43.334 --> 00:49:45.896]  I didn't weigh today and my workouts are
[00:49:46.869 --> 00:49:48.430]  Explosive compared to where they were.
[00:49:48.971 --> 00:49:50.292]  I'm doing three times the sets.
[00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:51.833]  I'm working out for an hour and a half.
[00:49:51.893 --> 00:49:52.934]  The sweat's pouring off.
[00:49:53.034 --> 00:49:53.835]  I'm feeling great.
[00:49:54.235 --> 00:49:55.336]  I feel like I'm 20 again.
[00:49:56.177 --> 00:49:57.318]  And so I'm committing this time.
[00:49:58.759 --> 00:49:59.239]  I'm committing.
[00:49:59.279 --> 00:50:00.521]  In fact, I'm going to walk around the room.
[00:50:00.841 --> 00:50:02.122]  You guys bring the mic in here, please.
[00:50:03.243 --> 00:50:08.807]  Folks, I'm telling you, this doesn't just fund the operation, which is a win-win by itself.
[00:50:09.617 --> 00:50:18.165]  This literally empowers patriots' bodies and helps us with the tools God gave us and the evidence, the science is all there.
[00:50:18.205 --> 00:50:18.745]  Thank you, Scott.
[00:50:19.366 --> 00:50:19.706]  Is it on?
[00:50:20.407 --> 00:50:20.707]  Thank you.
[00:50:21.067 --> 00:50:25.551]  Before we went on today, I told the crew, please get my mobile mic ready.
[00:50:26.312 --> 00:50:27.713]  And I'm going to tell you right now why I did that.
[00:50:29.755 --> 00:50:32.598]  I've done live shows before where I just wore a pair of sunglasses.
[00:50:33.888 --> 00:50:40.012]  And back when we were on YouTube, it'd get like three times more views if I wore sunglasses or a cowboy hat, because it's out of the ordinary.
[00:50:40.332 --> 00:50:42.133]  People ask themselves, what's different about this?
[00:50:42.953 --> 00:50:50.918]  So today I decided to get the mic here and, you know, stand up because I want to note to everybody, this is special.
[00:50:51.699 --> 00:50:52.419]  This is important.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.900]  I'm 45 years old.
[00:50:56.021 --> 00:51:02.045]  When I was 35, I swam up to two miles a day sometimes and would jog and couldn't lose weight.
[00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.491]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:10.253]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[00:51:10.933 --> 00:51:16.095]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[00:51:16.415 --> 00:51:21.357]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Chaikoms in.
[00:51:21.557 --> 00:51:23.297]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:25.318]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[00:51:26.458 --> 00:51:27.839]  I didn't know about all this.
[00:51:28.639 --> 00:51:30.280]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:32.952]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[00:51:34.053 --> 00:51:42.318]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:49.282]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[00:51:49.302 --> 00:51:50.703]  Let me tell you something right now.
[00:51:52.064 --> 00:51:52.845]  You see DNA Force?
[00:51:53.962 --> 00:52:07.229]  I went out to top manufacturers that are the most respected, most highly tested, and I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[00:52:08.189 --> 00:52:10.711]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each bottle.
[00:52:11.191 --> 00:52:13.912]  I said, I want to put $50 a bottle in it.
[00:52:13.932 --> 00:52:14.953]  They said, nobody's ever done that.
[00:52:15.598 --> 00:52:18.280]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was going to buy.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.803]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[00:52:22.503 --> 00:52:23.544]  Nobody does that!
[00:52:24.405 --> 00:52:30.689]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this, and you research every ingredient in this, and then you experience it for yourself.
[00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:32.251]  It's incredible.
[00:52:34.412 --> 00:52:36.854]  There's nothing like what God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:52:37.074 --> 00:52:38.335]  There's nothing as strong.
[00:52:39.776 --> 00:52:41.978]  And you look at all the things
[00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:44.520]  that are in this.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:53.807]  ELV ATP, the number one ingredient in 2008 winning all the awards for increased cellular energy levels and improves athletic performance.
[00:52:54.107 --> 00:52:55.609]  CoQ10, we have the best form of it.
[00:52:56.397 --> 00:53:01.399]  The ingredient was popularized and studied by Dr. Peter Mitchell and won the Nobel Prize for CoQ10.
[00:53:01.579 --> 00:53:03.199]  This is a Nobel Prize winning ingredient.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.560]  PQQ, we got the best form of that.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.321]  This ingredient has won multiple awards including ingredient with best science.
[00:53:09.622 --> 00:53:13.083]  There are over a thousand published studies on PQQ health benefits.
[00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:14.823]  You might want to go read them.
[00:53:15.304 --> 00:53:17.424]  They make your telomeres last longer.
[00:53:17.804 --> 00:53:18.665]  That's the DNA.
[00:53:20.245 --> 00:53:24.187]  They literally rejuvenate the cells and the engines in them.
[00:53:24.447 --> 00:53:24.767]  And again,
[00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:29.864]  I get in the habit of getting so busy, I forget to eat breakfast most mornings.
[00:53:30.445 --> 00:53:31.545]  I almost didn't eat lunch today.
[00:53:32.045 --> 00:53:33.526]  They're like, hey, you're being a jerk, eat lunch.
[00:53:33.706 --> 00:53:34.506]  I was better after that.
[00:53:36.027 --> 00:53:45.070]  You take the X2, you take the X3, you take the bodies to America, you take the DNA force, because this is, this is the next level.
[00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:52.353]  You get a great response from it, and you fund the second American revolution worldwide.
[00:53:52.373 --> 00:53:52.913]  But I want to be clear.
[00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:57.780]  Whether it's X2 or whether it's DNA Force Plus, this stuff isn't a game.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:04.004]  I chopped my finger off 15 years ago helping people on the lake whose boat was on fire.
[00:54:05.745 --> 00:54:06.805]  Old Kevin Booth was there.
[00:54:07.626 --> 00:54:11.048]  Long story short, it was quite a fiasco.
[00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:18.813]  The finger was still numb until I took the original DNA Force five years ago.
[00:54:19.574 --> 00:54:20.394]  Feeling came back in it.
[00:54:21.235 --> 00:54:23.036]  You can actually say, because it's patented,
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.741]  That it regrows nerves.
[00:54:26.302 --> 00:54:32.125]  Now that doesn't mean if you've broken your back and you're paralyzed, it's going to, you know, reconnect those giant nerves.
[00:54:32.185 --> 00:54:39.109]  But I had old back pains and things and old areas that were numb from football injuries where the nerves were so dead, I had no feeling.
[00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.752]  The back pain came back and then the back pain went away.
[00:54:43.152 --> 00:54:47.375]  So what I'm saying is it's not all just roses to have your nerves come back.
[00:54:47.995 --> 00:54:52.678]  So you need to know PQQ, CoQ10 and the other ingredients in this aren't
[00:54:53.803 --> 00:54:54.303]  Child's play.
[00:54:54.863 --> 00:54:55.984]  This is stuff God gave us.
[00:54:56.324 --> 00:54:57.024]  It's powerful.
[00:54:57.624 --> 00:54:59.604]  So consult your physician before you take it.
[00:55:00.245 --> 00:55:03.545]  Because it could interact with something else you're involved in.
[00:55:04.326 --> 00:55:05.866]  Because we're not selling placebos.
[00:55:06.486 --> 00:55:07.686]  We're not selling snake oil.
[00:55:08.047 --> 00:55:11.727]  We're selling the most powerful nutraceuticals on the market.
[00:55:11.967 --> 00:55:14.888]  Because I want to be that guy that puts out the best fish oil.
[00:55:15.368 --> 00:55:17.249]  I want to be the guy that puts out the best iodine.
[00:55:17.569 --> 00:55:20.470]  I want to be the guy that puts out the best turmeric concentrate.
[00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:21.850]  I want to be the guy
[00:55:23.697 --> 00:55:38.762]  That when you order the products we sell, you go, man, his info is not just good, his products are amazing, because I want a relationship with you, and I want to have a better world with you, and I want to dominate the globalists, and I want you to be healthy, because that's what I want for myself.
[00:55:39.382 --> 00:55:40.663]  And we're all connected.
[00:55:40.963 --> 00:55:43.924]  And anybody that tells you we're not connected is a Satanist.
[00:55:44.664 --> 00:55:50.246]  They may not know they're a Satanist, but Satanism is believing you're alone.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.282]  And believing that what you do doesn't come back on you.
[00:55:53.322 --> 00:55:57.926]  Listen, I'm a total individualist, but we are all collectively tied to each other.
[00:55:58.146 --> 00:56:01.849]  I believe individual freedom, but not at the expense of others.
[00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.531]  And that's the...
[00:56:05.563 --> 00:56:10.385]  Freedom and the free will God gave us is to be individuals but collectively connected.
[00:56:11.205 --> 00:56:14.587]  Not individuals who don't care about anybody but ourselves.
[00:56:15.207 --> 00:56:20.269]  So I want to encourage everybody, learn about the secret history of iodine and the IQ reduction when you don't take it.
[00:56:20.769 --> 00:56:24.271]  Learn about PQQ, CoQ10, Reservatol, and all the other things.
[00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:32.154]  I mean, there's so many that are in R-alpha lipoic acid, rhodiola, astragalus,
[00:56:33.547 --> 00:56:33.988]  Rishi?
[00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:35.549]  Reservatrol?
[00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:37.772]  I mean, I just don't have time to go over it all.
[00:56:38.052 --> 00:56:42.177]  And they're all the best, the highest quality, and they fund the information war.
[00:56:42.438 --> 00:56:45.601]  This bottle could be full of air.
[00:56:45.701 --> 00:56:46.102]  It's not.
[00:56:46.382 --> 00:56:47.604]  It's full of the highest quality product.
[00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:51.058]  And it would still fund a revolution against tyranny.
[00:56:51.198 --> 00:56:54.322]  It would still stand up for unborn babies and born babies.
[00:56:54.982 --> 00:56:56.644]  And our very country's existence.
[00:56:56.704 --> 00:57:00.949]  But, just like our information is powerful, this product is powerful, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:01.369 --> 00:57:02.410]  And that's why I'm so proud of it.
[00:57:03.031 --> 00:57:05.494]  So know this, when you get DNA Force Plus,
[00:57:06.892 --> 00:57:15.374]  It takes a few weeks to kick in, just like the iodine, because it changes the entire metabolic system in the body from the research that I've done in my own personal experience.
[00:57:15.894 --> 00:57:16.934]  And it's big medicine.
[00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:18.514]  It's big mojo.
[00:57:19.055 --> 00:57:19.595]  It's big.
[00:57:20.475 --> 00:57:22.215]  It's not globalist crap.
[00:57:22.515 --> 00:57:22.995]  It delivers.
[00:57:23.856 --> 00:57:24.756]  So check it out today.
[00:57:24.916 --> 00:57:29.357]  Both products, DNA Force Plus and the high-quality iodine X2 and X3.
[00:57:29.377 --> 00:57:30.417]  So that's three products.
[00:57:30.737 --> 00:57:34.258]  They're all 50% off right now, so you can experience these.
[00:57:34.278 --> 00:57:35.638]  A lot of you have already experienced it.
[00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:38.451]  You get great results, you forget about it, like I did.
[00:57:38.871 --> 00:57:39.452]  Get back on it.
[00:57:39.472 --> 00:57:40.472]  A lot of you stay on it.
[00:57:41.032 --> 00:57:43.634]  A lot of people haven't tried it yet, and they need to experience it right now.
[00:57:44.134 --> 00:57:48.656]  InfoWarsLife.com for the X2, the X3, and of course the DNA Force Plus.
[00:57:49.157 --> 00:57:51.918]  Today, 50% off during this sale.
[00:57:51.938 --> 00:57:54.880]  Google's manipulation of votes.
[00:57:55.994 --> 00:58:01.918]  gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016.
[00:58:02.358 --> 00:58:03.739]  Is that correct?
[00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:07.622]  2.6 million is a rock-bottom minimum.
[00:58:08.302 --> 00:58:19.090]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:23.813]  They control these and no one can counteract them.
[00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.494]  These are not competitive.
[00:58:26.315 --> 00:58:31.101]  These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[00:58:32.203 --> 00:58:41.856]  Your testimony is that Google is, through bias in search results, manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of.
[00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:58.737]  On a massive scale, in 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.
[00:58:59.318 --> 00:59:03.780]  Without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:04.260]  And in 2020?
[00:59:06.855 --> 00:59:16.719]  You can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out, and the methods that they're using are invisible.
[00:59:16.779 --> 00:59:18.000]  They're subliminal.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:26.183]  They're more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences, and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years.
[00:59:26.203 --> 00:59:35.427]  A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, collectively.
[00:59:36.507 --> 00:59:41.049]  Massively influencing the results of elections.
[00:59:41.449 --> 00:59:43.650]  Senator, with respect, I must correct you.
[00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.030]  Please.
[00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:51.193]  If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go-vote reminder just to Democrats on Election Day, that doesn't cost him a dime.
[00:59:55.535 --> 01:00:01.457]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.097 --> 01:00:28.803]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.943 --> 01:00:35.186]  Comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting, and its comments are racist.
[01:00:36.378 --> 01:00:47.687]  The chair will remind all members, please, please, do not make comments toward personality-based comments.
[01:00:49.309 --> 01:01:05.402]  This whole Ilhan Omar, the Jihad Squad, all of it, really illustrates what a bunch of cowards the Republican establishment is, and how you turn on any channel, they're saying, well, what the president has said is racist, and he needs to walk it back.
[01:01:07.335 --> 01:01:12.649]  No, Ilhan Omar has openly said she doesn't like this country.
[01:01:13.516 --> 01:01:16.076]  She said that she's going to teach us how to be patriotic.
[01:01:16.376 --> 01:01:22.037]  If you go back into the four congresswomen, the things they've said about our country are terrible.
[01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:26.178]  What they've said about Israel are just terrible.
[01:01:27.318 --> 01:01:33.639]  I don't know, I can't say for sure, but certainly a lot of people say they hate our country, and I think it's a disgrace.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:42.241]  And so since the first day this president introduced the Muslim ban, knowing that the country I came from
[01:01:43.081 --> 01:01:49.948]  Was on that and that my country now was on the track of implementing fascist laws.
[01:01:51.209 --> 01:01:52.790]  I knew that I had to speak up.
[01:01:55.132 --> 01:02:02.419]  She comes to this country and squats on us and spits in our face.
[01:02:03.308 --> 01:02:04.709]  And we're supposed to bow down to her?
[01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:08.612]  You don't go to Mexico or someplace and run your mouth about how it sucks!
[01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:10.954]  They'd say, get the hell out of here if you don't like it!
[01:02:10.974 --> 01:02:14.958]  And that's how any other country in the world who isn't totally brainwashed acts!
[01:02:16.035 --> 01:02:21.778]  We're not saying get out of here because your background is an Arab slave family, Arab slave traders.
[01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:31.723]  We're saying because you're an arrogant, America-hating liar that says we're running concentration camps and our overworked border patrol are Nazis killing children.
[01:02:31.803 --> 01:02:42.148]  Right now, the president is committing human rights abuses at the border, keeping children in cages, and having human beings drinking out of toilets.
[01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:46.402]  Ilhan Omar goes along with the lie that children are drinking out of toilets.
[01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.686]  She came here as a refugee.
[01:02:49.946 --> 01:02:51.268]  She married her brother.
[01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:57.836]  She wrote letters to federal judges to get ISIS terrorists out of prison.
[01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:02.982]  She voted against Bill blocking terrorists from life insurance.
[01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:06.714]  The woman is a cancer.
[01:03:06.934 --> 01:03:11.157]  I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now.
[01:03:12.117 --> 01:03:16.460]  But I want you all to know that we are not going to let them.
[01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.902]  And the crowd was right behind her.
[01:03:21.122 --> 01:03:28.767]  To me, she's far more patriotic than the people who were at the rally chanting last night.
[01:03:29.787 --> 01:03:31.148]  And when I hear that,
[01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:34.782]  It makes me afraid.
[01:03:35.323 --> 01:03:39.984]  I'm concerned that Trump is building a militia, to be honest with you.
[01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:42.125]  Are there folks from Africa that come here that are great people?
[01:03:42.265 --> 01:03:42.805]  Absolutely.
[01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:51.768]  I've run into people that have immigrated here from Africa who are hardworking, smart, nice people, because they know to appreciate a country like the U.S.
[01:03:51.788 --> 01:03:53.568]  compared to some of the places they've come from.
[01:03:55.009 --> 01:04:02.871]  But a lot of people are brought here and have chips put on their shoulders by the left and by leaders the Democrats give them, like Ilhan Omar.
[01:04:05.981 --> 01:04:09.222]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're live for the rest of the broadcast today.
[01:04:09.543 --> 01:04:15.705]  I punched out the last two segments because I didn't want to go off half-cocked with what I was about to talk about.
[01:04:15.725 --> 01:04:31.432]  So I went and reviewed the last 30 minutes or so a lot of court documents, a lot of research, made some phone calls so that I could talk about what's currently happening because I realized that
[01:04:32.571 --> 01:04:36.692]  I've been so busy covering all the other big subjects, I'm so sick of Russiagate.
[01:04:37.372 --> 01:04:42.653]  But the criminal investigation of Russiagate and the espionage that was carried out by the Deep State, that is a huge story.
[01:04:43.034 --> 01:04:44.974]  And it's all about to come out in the open.
[01:04:45.634 --> 01:04:48.595]  And this also tells us whether Bob Barr's a good guy or not.
[01:04:49.715 --> 01:04:56.097]  So, I'm really ready to lay out some big stuff on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:56.777 --> 01:04:58.237]  And these type of things really upset me.
[01:04:58.277 --> 01:05:00.358]  It's very sad our country's gotten into this position.
[01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:01.118]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.046 --> 01:05:12.175]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:12.215 --> 01:05:18.961]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force+.
[01:05:19.562 --> 01:05:23.125]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[01:05:23.485 --> 01:05:26.967]  Telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[01:05:27.348 --> 01:05:35.733]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[01:05:35.773 --> 01:05:37.895]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but
[01:05:38.415 --> 01:05:39.096]  It's expensive.
[01:05:39.176 --> 01:05:39.436]  Why?
[01:05:39.496 --> 01:05:41.997]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:05:42.277 --> 01:05:49.221]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went.
[01:05:49.562 --> 01:05:52.263]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[01:05:52.623 --> 01:05:53.844]  It is the elite supplement.
[01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:57.926]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[01:05:57.946 --> 01:06:03.810]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:05.282 --> 01:06:07.503]  We're now six minutes into hour number two.
[01:06:32.102 --> 01:06:42.464]  On this July 23rd, 2019, worldwide, simulcast of radio and TV blasting out over the internet and on AM and FM and TV stations across the country and the world.
[01:06:46.245 --> 01:06:58.527]  The whole situation with the attempt by the entrenched bureaucracy or the deep state to keep President Trump from getting into office and then attempting to remove him from office
[01:06:59.842 --> 01:07:11.591]  is the greatest string of arrogant, outrageous, over-the-top criminal activity and treason and espionage against this nation.
[01:07:12.912 --> 01:07:21.139]  And then the subsequent lying and perjury and changing of stories is the most spectacular ever seen as well.
[01:07:22.895 --> 01:07:25.156]  But the country's 246 years old.
[01:07:25.216 --> 01:07:27.677]  It's gotten more and more corrupt over time.
[01:07:28.558 --> 01:07:32.580]  And as we become more powerful, the corruption has become more intense.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.162]  As Lord Acton famously said, power tends to corrupt.
[01:07:37.062 --> 01:07:40.204]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:42.405]  So here's the summation.
[01:07:43.206 --> 01:07:47.408]  And we have the live feed named today up on newswars.com.
[01:07:48.408 --> 01:07:49.689]  Deep state caught
[01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:57.729]  Spying on Trump and stealing national security information from the White House.
[01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.891]  What they did was a crime.
[01:08:02.892 --> 01:08:10.997]  And then how they would leak the information with lies sewn into it is also extremely criminal.
[01:08:12.578 --> 01:08:19.862]  Now, Trump's known all this, a lot of this, since the head of the NSA at the time,
[01:08:22.136 --> 01:08:27.180]  came over and visited him when he was president-elect at Trump Tower and gave him a good idea of what was going on.
[01:08:28.001 --> 01:08:35.187]  We knew what was going on because we were studying the globalists and their statements and their past activities and they were very arrogant about it when he was president-elect.
[01:08:35.227 --> 01:08:38.049]  They said, we've been spying on him, we got proof he's a Russian agent.
[01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:41.532]  And Trump said, well if you did, that's illegal.
[01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:43.473]  Show us your proof.
[01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.694]  They went, oh we never said that.
[01:08:45.215 --> 01:08:48.117]  So, there's a lot goes into this, but here's the big announcement.
[01:08:51.325 --> 01:08:53.747]  They haven't caught just one or two or three or four.
[01:08:55.208 --> 01:09:08.899]  They have caught dozens of people that have been in the White House two and a half plus years, and even before when he was president-elect, who've been actively trying to frame and set up the president.
[01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:12.683]  That itself, another giant crime.
[01:09:14.664 --> 01:09:19.808]  And now, a particular federal judge has been releasing
[01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:48.876]  tranches or segments of documents from Comey's blackmail diary that show his testimony to Congress was a lie and that show who was spying on who and then how they would leak fantastic lies from their quote sources so I've got several articles here in front of everybody needs to go read but the reason this is a big issue is
[01:09:52.284 --> 01:10:00.649]  The federal judge is now ordering that it all be released in the next month without redaction.
[01:10:02.611 --> 01:10:05.312]  Which shows the power structure now knows that Trump has the upper hand.
[01:10:05.953 --> 01:10:17.200]  And that shows that Bill Barr, the former Attorney General, now the current Attorney General, the reason he was confirmed so quickly was the establishment couldn't believe they were putting their guy, a fixer,
[01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:22.453]  From the George Herbert Walker days, from the CIA, not just the FBI.
[01:10:22.573 --> 01:10:29.560]  They couldn't believe they were putting this guy in, but he was there to cover their butt, but to sue for peace with Trump.
[01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:31.462]  But they've not sued for peace.
[01:10:31.582 --> 01:10:32.863]  They're still trying to take Trump out.
[01:10:33.464 --> 01:10:42.693]  And so Barr is asking all this stuff be redacted because it exposes the Clintons, and Obama, and the illegal spying, and the planting, and all the rest of it.
[01:10:45.799 --> 01:10:48.700]  So they don't know what to do.
[01:10:51.861 --> 01:10:53.621]  Because the left just can't stop their impeachment.
[01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:57.943]  They can't stop their fake Mueller investigation tomorrow.
[01:10:58.043 --> 01:11:11.687]  They can't stop the lie that Trump's a Russian agent, because that's how they started the fake national security investigation to begin with, and told people in the CIA and FBI, we have proof, we're going to take him out, get ready.
[01:11:12.597 --> 01:11:18.438]  Including, and you're going to hear this soon, plans to kill the president because he was a, quote, Russian asset.
[01:11:20.419 --> 01:11:28.880]  But a lot of their own people got cold feet when Trump got inaugurated, and then when the country turned around, and then when they learned that the dossier was fake.
[01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:32.061]  Their own people were buying this.
[01:11:33.041 --> 01:11:34.202]  And that's in all these documents.
[01:11:34.222 --> 01:11:36.302]  They really thought Trump was a Russian agent.
[01:11:37.522 --> 01:11:40.263]  When Hillary and Obama are CHICOM agents.
[01:11:41.749 --> 01:11:43.510]  And that's all illustrated now all over the news.
[01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:45.130]  It's all coming out.
[01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:55.674]  So they've discovered not just one, not just two, not just three, but a bunch of these people and it's all coming out.
[01:11:55.734 --> 01:11:57.034]  And so that's why they're so panicked.
[01:11:57.074 --> 01:12:09.839]  And there are multiple, I'm told three grand juries in DC, Virginia, and Maryland, at least, that are going to be returning indictments.
[01:12:11.678 --> 01:12:13.759]  against some of these individuals.
[01:12:13.799 --> 01:12:14.859]  And you need to go read these articles.
[01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:18.301]  One's from The Last Refuge, and it links to all the court documents and statements.
[01:12:18.741 --> 01:12:24.103]  James Comey had designated FBI spy in the White House, who now works for CNN.
[01:12:25.444 --> 01:12:26.685]  This report goes through everything.
[01:12:26.845 --> 01:12:28.005]  I'm going to read some of this in a moment.
[01:12:29.626 --> 01:12:37.709]  Comey, cyber spy in White House, stole classified White House material, is now working for CNN.
[01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:40.951]  And of course, his name is Anthony
[01:12:44.322 --> 01:12:47.743]  And we can roll some B-roll of him on CNN hosting shows.
[01:12:47.843 --> 01:12:49.883]  I'd queued that up about 30 minutes ago.
[01:12:51.183 --> 01:12:55.204]  Now, this individual is just one of them.
[01:12:58.025 --> 01:13:00.725]  And he works for the deep state.
[01:13:02.165 --> 01:13:11.227]  And it comes out that he was working with the Italian government, reportedly, to plant on Italian citizens' computers that own server companies
[01:13:12.386 --> 01:13:17.728]  Wikileaks info, to then plant it in the US, to then set up Trump.
[01:13:18.309 --> 01:13:20.550]  And that's all come out in the Italian courts.
[01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:28.473]  It's just bombshell information to have all of this going on.
[01:13:28.793 --> 01:13:33.955]  So these individuals decided to set up the president, they decided to frame him, but there was literally nothing.
[01:13:36.337 --> 01:13:39.298]  And so this individual was supposedly in the White House,
[01:13:40.618 --> 01:13:51.282]  Advising Trump on national security, on cyber security, while he was in the Russia investigation run by Hillary and her people and Obama in the deep state.
[01:13:51.762 --> 01:13:55.684]  And again, trying to then find ways to plant info on the President.
[01:13:56.544 --> 01:13:58.185]  And these articles go through all of this.
[01:13:58.305 --> 01:13:59.445]  It's beyond sensational.
[01:13:59.925 --> 01:14:01.226]  Now, we already know all this.
[01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:08.569]  But the fact is, we now learn that Mr. Barr
[01:14:11.368 --> 01:14:13.029]  understands this can blow up the whole government.
[01:14:13.609 --> 01:14:17.010]  So he's in there saying Trump did nothing wrong, and that's all true.
[01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:18.030]  They're attacking him.
[01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:28.694]  But now we learn he's actually in there, just like I said he was, totally and completely protecting Brennan, Clapper, Hillary, all of them.
[01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:35.129]  Because they have all the damning evidence of the perjury to Congress, the illegally spying.
[01:14:35.409 --> 01:14:39.950]  Didn't have authorization from the Attorney General to do this to the President, and the Attorney General can't do that.
[01:14:40.211 --> 01:14:47.033]  Even if you say, oh, we think the President's a Russian agent, we've got to do this, you still go to Congress for an impeachment.
[01:14:48.214 --> 01:14:51.015]  Or every President would be accused of being a foreign asset.
[01:14:51.435 --> 01:14:53.316]  Globalism is a foreign asset.
[01:14:53.716 --> 01:14:55.396]  Globalism is overthrowing the country.
[01:14:55.656 --> 01:14:59.318]  Globalism is saying we can't say America or American in colleges.
[01:15:00.322 --> 01:15:02.702]  Or that we can't say that our country is exceptional.
[01:15:03.182 --> 01:15:05.503]  And CNN says, America sucks.
[01:15:06.183 --> 01:15:07.703]  These Trump supporters love America.
[01:15:07.923 --> 01:15:08.843]  They're bad people.
[01:15:09.364 --> 01:15:10.244]  That's the enemy.
[01:15:10.624 --> 01:15:11.664]  That's the outsider.
[01:15:12.024 --> 01:15:12.904]  That's the globalist.
[01:15:12.984 --> 01:15:15.765]  They're the ones that want our economy imploded and are trying to implode it.
[01:15:16.905 --> 01:15:18.205]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:15:19.665 --> 01:15:22.506]  And the fruit of the Democrat deep state tree is poison.
[01:15:23.006 --> 01:15:25.106]  The fruit of the neocon tree is poison.
[01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:26.826]  Total and complete poison.
[01:15:26.846 --> 01:15:29.767]  So when we come back, I'm going to run through these court documents.
[01:15:31.118 --> 01:15:34.621]  And I'm gonna get into what's coming out next.
[01:15:35.181 --> 01:15:38.323]  But the judge has ruled it's all coming out.
[01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:44.828]  And it's a total blueprint, a lot of it's already out, of treason, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:47.090]  A blueprint of trying to remove the president.
[01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:50.512]  But the president was so clean, there was nothing there.
[01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:54.115]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:15:54.935 --> 01:15:56.276]  We're beating the deep state together.
[01:15:56.776 --> 01:16:00.019]  So I salute you, the crew, and everybody else for making this broadcast possible.
[01:16:02.723 --> 01:16:13.745]  There is a stated planetary plan set out by the Fortune 100 corporations and the megabanks to outlaw the existence of nation-states.
[01:16:14.225 --> 01:16:24.607]  A year and a half ago, when they were trying to take down Confederate statues around the country, I warned people, next it would be Thomas Jefferson, the writer of the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.
[01:16:25.307 --> 01:16:30.188]  Sure enough, they want his statues taken down, even though he pushed to end slavery himself.
[01:16:31.246 --> 01:16:39.690]  And now, Colin Kaepernick didn't like the Betsy Ross flag saying it was for slavery, even though she was an abolitionist.
[01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:45.852]  That means, again, someone who pushed the outlawing of slavery that England started worldwide.
[01:16:46.113 --> 01:16:50.975]  But the West gets the blame for slavery still being carried out by Muslims in at least four countries.
[01:16:51.455 --> 01:16:52.775]  But again, facts don't matter.
[01:16:53.216 --> 01:16:58.278]  And now, not just the University of Colorado State, but other universities
[01:16:59.574 --> 01:17:03.876]  Are saying, don't say Americans, America, or policeman.
[01:17:05.958 --> 01:17:09.740]  This is the mind control these individuals are engaged in.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.321]  Now, they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.102]  This is psychological warfare.
[01:17:14.762 --> 01:17:22.367]  I had the idea on the 4th of July, when we launched it, when Kaepernick was demonizing the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag.
[01:17:23.767 --> 01:17:28.110]  To say, hey, let's just put out t-shirts that have the Betsy Ross flag on it saying, these colors don't rhyme.
[01:17:29.628 --> 01:17:31.530]  It's the best-selling shirt we've ever had.
[01:17:31.931 --> 01:17:33.953]  It's already starting to surpass Hillary for President.
[01:17:34.494 --> 01:17:35.676]  Which, of course, we started as well.
[01:17:36.156 --> 01:17:38.679]  Limbaugh, a few days after I did, had the same idea.
[01:17:38.699 --> 01:17:39.921]  Because it's just common sense.
[01:17:40.221 --> 01:17:41.443]  And put out his own Betsy Ross flag.
[01:17:42.608 --> 01:17:54.178]  And I was watching him on Fox, and he really made the best points and encapsulated what I've been trying to say, that we're so sick of being demonized, we're so sick of everything that's Americana being called racist or evil, that the American flag's too far.
[01:17:55.079 --> 01:18:08.750]  And that's why people are responding everywhere, flying not just the classic American flag that we all know of today, but the original American flag, back in their face, and saying, no, you cult, control freak, bully monsters.
[01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:14.239]  We're going to be proud of our country, and we're going to stand up and speak out against you.
[01:18:14.879 --> 01:18:17.220]  They call that censorship, by the way, when we disagree with them.
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:19.440]  The left's the ones trying to get rid of the First Amendment.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.381]  If anybody's fascist, it's them.
[01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:23.901]  And so we had a limited edition Betsy Ross flag.
[01:18:23.981 --> 01:18:24.502]  It sold out.
[01:18:25.002 --> 01:18:30.483]  We've got four new variants that are the next limited edition that are very similar to the last two.
[01:18:31.783 --> 01:18:34.144]  I think we've been upgraded the font, changed some of the colors.
[01:18:34.864 --> 01:18:35.444]  They're powerful.
[01:18:35.784 --> 01:18:43.067]  And then we also have a new one that's the American flag with the Gadsden snake that says, don't tread on me.
[01:18:43.107 --> 01:18:44.268]  It just goes perfectly together.
[01:18:44.868 --> 01:18:45.468]  A double meaning.
[01:18:46.008 --> 01:18:49.370]  And on the back it says, America's back, which is very triggering to leftists.
[01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:50.850]  Infowars.com.
[01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:52.231]  And this is a win-win.
[01:18:52.271 --> 01:19:00.874]  You get to support the American flag, stand up for free speech, let the globalists and their minions know that we outnumber them and we're not going to submit to their tyranny and their oppression.
[01:19:01.074 --> 01:19:02.235]  We're not going to take our colors down.
[01:19:03.115 --> 01:19:04.376]  And let them know that they've conquered us.
[01:19:04.396 --> 01:19:06.438]  It's the last thing you do when you conquer somebody is take their flag down.
[01:19:06.698 --> 01:19:07.959]  It's incredible humiliation.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.024]  And it funds this operation that's under globalist attack and they're trying to shut us down.
[01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:17.187]  So InfoWars existing is an act of defiance against their evil.
[01:19:17.627 --> 01:19:19.229]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:19.969 --> 01:19:25.214]  We have the Don't Tread on the American Flag in Betsy Ross and in the modern flag.
[01:19:26.465 --> 01:19:34.115]  And then we also have the two new variants as well of the Betsy Ross flag at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:34.155 --> 01:19:36.438]  So I'm very, very excited about these shirts.
[01:19:37.058 --> 01:19:38.580]  I'm already seeing people out there wearing them.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.762]  They've got five-star reviews.
[01:19:40.002 --> 01:19:43.667]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:19:43.707 --> 01:19:44.428]  A true 360 win.
[01:19:45.589 --> 01:19:46.610]  They're trying to remove the flag?
[01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:50.412]  We bring it back in their face and we fund the InfoWar at the same time.
[01:19:50.712 --> 01:19:52.573]  A true 360 win.
[01:19:52.713 --> 01:20:02.179]  Get your shirts, give them as gifts, give them to your grandchildren, give them to your husband, give them to your wife, give them to your co-workers, and fund the InfoWar while you get great shirts as well.
[01:20:06.382 --> 01:20:09.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:37.888 --> 01:20:48.173]  Spies have been caught inside the White House working for multinational corporations, using their government credentials to carry out the fraud and theft.
[01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:58.725]  Massive amounts of national security data has been stolen and sold to CNN, MSNBC, and others who then sell the information to foreign governments.
[01:20:59.885 --> 01:21:05.607]  You see, globalism itself is espionage against the nation-state and against the people of the nation-state.
[01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:17.272]  And now, federal judges are releasing documents and are set to release documents exposing the full criminal extent of how President Trump was spied on when he was a candidate,
[01:21:18.066 --> 01:21:24.831]  When he was president-elect, and when he was president, and how they tried to set him up, and how they perjured themselves to Congress.
[01:21:27.032 --> 01:21:28.693]  This thing is more than coming to a head.
[01:21:30.074 --> 01:21:32.616]  It's like a volcano when it explodes.
[01:21:33.957 --> 01:21:36.219]  And this is all being reported right now.
[01:21:36.279 --> 01:21:38.380]  We have major federal government watchdog groups.
[01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:40.622]  We have federal judges.
[01:21:43.905 --> 01:21:45.865]  Coming out and laying all this out.
[01:21:46.345 --> 01:21:49.146]  And if you're a TV viewer, we're putting the judge's rulings on screen.
[01:21:49.466 --> 01:21:49.806]  All of it.
[01:21:49.826 --> 01:21:52.387]  But let me just get into the basic facts here.
[01:21:53.107 --> 01:21:56.407]  Because this thing is like a cake that's been baked.
[01:21:57.148 --> 01:21:59.088]  We heard the ping on the timer.
[01:21:59.928 --> 01:22:01.908]  That lets us know the next shoe is about to drop.
[01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:04.009]  My sources told me a week ago.
[01:22:04.029 --> 01:22:07.710]  And it just got lost in the haze of battle.
[01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:08.330]  Hey, get ready.
[01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:09.210]  They are going to indict.
[01:22:10.131 --> 01:22:13.572]  People, they've got three grand juries open, and the word is they're getting ready to indict.
[01:22:13.632 --> 01:22:15.672]  It's why the Democrats are so damn scared.
[01:22:16.252 --> 01:22:17.412]  It's why they're bringing Mueller back.
[01:22:17.492 --> 01:22:18.532]  He doesn't want to testify.
[01:22:18.552 --> 01:22:27.434]  He knows that his mentor, Bill Barr, who brought him in, that's who brought him in, has told him, you need to stop.
[01:22:27.474 --> 01:22:29.014]  Trump's got the royal flush.
[01:22:29.534 --> 01:22:32.095]  And unless you assassinate him, he's going to destroy you.
[01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:38.196]  And the president has been convinced to back off, but then they've broken the deal.
[01:22:40.131 --> 01:22:41.712]  President doesn't want destabilization.
[01:22:41.732 --> 01:22:47.918]  He doesn't want this to happen to the FBI and the CIA, but they're hopelessly corrupt sewers at the top.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.223]  This is a long time deep state civil war coming to a head.
[01:22:54.243 --> 01:22:55.644]  I have documents on that as well.
[01:22:56.905 --> 01:23:00.649]  So real clear investigations and others break all this down.
[01:23:00.829 --> 01:23:02.030]  I've done deep research on this.
[01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:06.554]  I can tell you it's very, very accurate and it just lays out
[01:23:08.427 --> 01:23:22.770]  How Bill Barr has been trying to suppress all this, but now multiple federal judges have ordered that even more of the damning documents come out.
[01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:36.873]  And yes, stunningly, Judge Mossberg has ordered the archery declarations to be fully released to the public without redactions.
[01:23:39.693 --> 01:23:41.854]  And it goes through Comey's notes, everything.
[01:23:42.294 --> 01:23:47.897]  That means all those black boxes in the example above would have been removed.
[01:23:48.917 --> 01:24:00.502]  And so now the new groups of documents be released from a whole fake Russiagate that's really a blueprint of their crimes against the American people and against our electoral process are going to be released unredacted.
[01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:13.561]  And so Bill Barr tried to protect the power structure, but the power structure was so hopelessly corrupt and senile and arrogant that they're continuing to attack.
[01:24:14.722 --> 01:24:18.325]  And so now Trump is going on the attack, and that's really the big news here.
[01:24:19.086 --> 01:24:19.907]  There's so many things here.
[01:24:19.927 --> 01:24:20.908]  Trump's going on the attack.
[01:24:21.328 --> 01:24:22.970]  The grand juries are out, set to indict.
[01:24:24.386 --> 01:24:29.628]  I was told judges are about to just release it all, because if the agencies won't do it, Trump's got judges that will.
[01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:30.768]  That's happening.
[01:24:31.028 --> 01:24:32.729]  We've been following every step of this.
[01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:39.371]  And it's a giant world, a giant cosmology.
[01:24:39.391 --> 01:24:42.712]  It'd be like if somebody told me, describe to me the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[01:24:44.052 --> 01:24:46.233]  How do you describe three books, thousands of pages?
[01:24:46.753 --> 01:24:49.214]  Well, imagine trying to describe how big this is.
[01:24:49.554 --> 01:24:50.674]  But you've all been living it.
[01:24:51.575 --> 01:24:52.635]  You've all been seeing it.
[01:24:54.258 --> 01:25:12.342]  And when you look at the arrogance of people like Anthony, the FBI minion, Fanate, and the things that he's done, and just how they believe that they're invincible, and how they can get away with anything they want, that's just not the case.
[01:25:12.382 --> 01:25:23.724]  And again, he's been working as a consultant before and after at CNN, bringing them the national security goodies, because Trump would talk about something in a meeting
[01:25:24.915 --> 01:25:29.738]  And then he'd see it that night on CNN, but with lies added to it.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.041]  And so Trump started planting disinfo.
[01:25:35.382 --> 01:25:39.885]  And then he was figuring out who was in the meetings, who was doing it, what was happening.
[01:25:41.706 --> 01:25:49.952]  So imagine trying to run a government when you're surrounded by all these people who brag, oh, we don't listen to him.
[01:25:51.773 --> 01:25:54.295]  Oh, when he signs an order, we just throw it away and hope he
[01:25:55.131 --> 01:25:55.772]  Forgets about it.
[01:25:57.052 --> 01:26:02.877]  To where Trump now has to carry around a little notebook with notes on what he's told him to do and he has to go back through that notebook.
[01:26:03.257 --> 01:26:05.699]  Never had to do that as a guy running hundreds of properties.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.380]  Thousands of properties.
[01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:15.286]  But he has to do it because in business people get promoted for working hard and being smart and doing their job and being able to be counted on.
[01:26:15.426 --> 01:26:15.927]  In D.C.
[01:26:15.967 --> 01:26:18.269]  they do it for being snakes.
[01:26:18.409 --> 01:26:19.309]  They get advanced for that.
[01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:21.731]  That's why it's not a swamp.
[01:26:21.791 --> 01:26:23.653]  It's a giant open-air sewer.
[01:26:24.744 --> 01:26:26.624]  And you know what they do to everybody who's in U.S.
[01:26:26.684 --> 01:26:29.105]  intelligence or who's in the corporate world in D.C.?
[01:26:29.445 --> 01:26:30.585]  They call up and they threaten you.
[01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:31.986]  They threaten your wife.
[01:26:32.906 --> 01:26:35.846]  And they hack into your computers and they find out what investments you have.
[01:26:36.486 --> 01:26:38.367]  And they start threatening your children at school.
[01:26:39.167 --> 01:26:41.247]  I'm not the government and I've had this stuff go on.
[01:26:42.528 --> 01:26:47.209]  And they have been harassing thousands and thousands of people, hardcore.
[01:26:48.349 --> 01:26:50.529]  And most people go, whoa, I'll be a double agent.
[01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:52.990]  I'll claim I'm for Trump by day.
[01:26:54.071 --> 01:26:55.732]  I'll work against Trump by night.
[01:26:57.213 --> 01:27:01.816]  But the longer Trump stays in, almost three years now, they're out of gas.
[01:27:01.856 --> 01:27:02.476]  They're tired.
[01:27:02.837 --> 01:27:03.897]  They know they've committed crimes.
[01:27:03.937 --> 01:27:05.698]  They know there's grand juries open out there.
[01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:08.260]  They know that they're under scrutiny.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.623]  They know that the actual people that work and defend the country are on Trump's side.
[01:27:13.223 --> 01:27:17.166]  And they see that hourglass almost empty and know time's up.
[01:27:18.729 --> 01:27:21.632]  That's why the left, oh, don't regulate big tech, because they were running it.
[01:27:21.692 --> 01:27:24.415]  Now that Trump's about to move in on it, oh yeah, we want to regulate.
[01:27:24.696 --> 01:27:30.182]  They want to get their hands in there to use it to prohibit our speech, not have laws that say don't prohibit.
[01:27:30.842 --> 01:27:33.806]  The First Amendment protects rights, doesn't take them.
[01:27:34.775 --> 01:27:45.361]  And if we don't have regulations against the censorship, and against the combines, and against the cartels, then the Chinese communist, and the globalist EU, and others will come in via the vacuum.
[01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:47.882]  And that's what Ted Cruz and the President now say.
[01:27:48.242 --> 01:27:50.263]  We've already got Europe regulating our internet.
[01:27:50.383 --> 01:27:50.864]  We built it.
[01:27:51.144 --> 01:27:51.924]  We're not going to let them.
[01:27:52.485 --> 01:27:52.985]  Yes.
[01:27:53.684 --> 01:27:55.285]  I know how to talk to these people.
[01:27:56.025 --> 01:27:59.747]  And I will tell you, we spearheaded the Common Sense to D.C.
[01:28:00.248 --> 01:28:05.490]  You sit there and take Google's money, in a couple years it'll be pure chi-com, the money will even be cut off.
[01:28:05.831 --> 01:28:11.774]  So even if you only care about the money, you better take control of these to keep the money flow going, dumbass!
[01:28:14.035 --> 01:28:21.019]  And I'm not calling Ted Cruz a dumbass or the President, but I'm talking about the average person in Congress, is a lowly, bootlicking follower.
[01:28:22.025 --> 01:28:29.980]  Who was put into power because they climbed up the ranks of ass-kissing, like dung beetles, rolling piles of crap around.
[01:28:31.091 --> 01:28:36.493]  I am affecting the world from the grassroots, building a whole new system, like we did with the Republic.
[01:28:36.793 --> 01:28:38.193]  This is Renaissance Radio.
[01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.374]  This is the next level.
[01:28:40.714 --> 01:28:43.575]  This is the pro-human future.
[01:28:44.555 --> 01:28:47.076]  Next year's news today, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:47.616 --> 01:28:49.736]  Now, we got something very interesting coming up.
[01:28:49.816 --> 01:28:54.758]  I'm not even going to tell you until we land this very interesting fish in the boat.
[01:28:55.298 --> 01:28:56.838]  We'll see if that happens on the other side.
[01:28:57.179 --> 01:28:58.119]  More coming straight ahead.
[01:28:58.139 --> 01:28:58.559]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.961 --> 01:29:18.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta tell ya, the InfoWars Live Protein Bars are really popular around the InfoWars office.
[01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:21.232]  I mean, people around here cannot get enough of them.
[01:29:21.252 --> 01:29:22.012]  I'm telling you.
[01:29:22.392 --> 01:29:23.973]  In fact, myself included.
[01:29:24.253 --> 01:29:28.116]  Let me just show you why the InfoWars Live Protein Bar is so popular, man.
[01:29:28.416 --> 01:29:31.838]  This thing is like a double fudge brownie
[01:29:32.358 --> 01:29:32.898]  Look at that.
[01:29:33.178 --> 01:29:37.020]  Wrapped in peanut butter with peanuts in the middle.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:41.061]  I mean, you cannot get a better tasting protein bar than this.
[01:29:41.382 --> 01:29:46.203]  And that's why people around the InfoWars office are going crazy for them and we can't even keep them on the shelves.
[01:29:46.403 --> 01:29:48.484]  But they're on sale for 40% off right now.
[01:29:48.724 --> 01:29:57.588]  So get your InfoWars Live Protein Bar 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com and you can be just like the crew around here enjoying the best protein bar on the market.
[01:30:02.498 --> 01:30:05.821]  You need to hear this clip from G. Edward Griffin, 1969.
[01:30:06.261 --> 01:30:14.268]  I've said many times, talked about how Bill Ayers, the weather underground, those people, popularized the term white skin privilege.
[01:30:14.708 --> 01:30:19.933]  They wanted to have a division in American society.
[01:30:20.033 --> 01:30:21.915]  They were not able to achieve it.
[01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:30.400]  By breaking the country into economic classes, because we didn't have that kind of rigid economic stratification of classes like they did in Europe.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.202]  So they wanted to use race.
[01:30:32.843 --> 01:30:33.604]  Perceived race.
[01:30:33.745 --> 01:30:34.966]  Skin color, let's just call it that.
[01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:40.073]  Because again, as I said, as a Christian I don't see people... There's the human race.
[01:30:41.014 --> 01:30:44.535]  And the only question is which direction they're racing, you know.
[01:30:45.536 --> 01:30:53.219]  But again, G. Edward Griffin said in 1969, he said, this is coming from the Communist Party headquarters.
[01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:58.381]  What they're telling people is when they call you a communist, you call them a fascist.
[01:30:58.501 --> 01:31:00.262]  You present yourself as anti-fascist.
[01:31:00.282 --> 01:31:01.602]  1969 he said this.
[01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:03.163]  What did they call themselves today?
[01:31:03.503 --> 01:31:05.604]  And what did we see AOC say this week?
[01:31:06.599 --> 01:31:08.300]  She said, oh, you call me a communist?
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.521]  That is just a dog whistle for race.
[01:31:11.082 --> 01:31:11.442]  Racism.
[01:31:11.462 --> 01:31:12.643]  White supremacy.
[01:31:14.364 --> 01:31:15.584]  Right out of the playbook.
[01:31:16.185 --> 01:31:17.545]  Right out of the playbook.
[01:31:17.565 --> 01:31:18.706]  50-year-old playbook.
[01:31:20.147 --> 01:31:21.668]  Here's G. Edward Griffin again.
[01:31:21.868 --> 01:31:23.749]  Run that clip.
[01:31:23.849 --> 01:31:30.393]  In 1943, the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States.
[01:31:31.053 --> 01:31:35.636]  It read, when certain obstructionists become too irritating,
[01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:47.262]  Label them, after suitable build-ups, as fascist, or Nazi, or anti-semitic, and use the prestige of anti-fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them.
[01:31:48.163 --> 01:31:54.706]  In the public mind, constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell.
[01:31:55.426 --> 01:32:00.429]  The association will, after enough repetition, become fact in the public mind.
[01:32:01.624 --> 01:32:21.890]  So you call people that oppose you white supremacists and it becomes a fact because you've got people like CNN that repeat that and of course that was 50 years ago and he was reading then from a document from inside the Communist Party USA that was 13 years old at the time so 63 years old this agenda that they're now enacting and here is the woman
[01:32:22.921 --> 01:32:34.409]  Who is calling President Trump and all of his supporters in North Carolina white supremacists, racists, you know, anybody that criticizes her as a communist, which she is.
[01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:38.212]  The policies that she supports, the policies that Ilhan Omar supports.
[01:32:38.232 --> 01:32:40.754]  You take a look at her campaign website.
[01:32:41.034 --> 01:32:41.795]  Ilhan's vision.
[01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:42.295]  What is it?
[01:32:43.016 --> 01:32:44.557]  It's nothing but full-on Marxism.
[01:32:44.977 --> 01:32:51.202]  Her vision is the vision of the Communist Party USA from the early 20th century.
[01:32:52.745 --> 01:32:56.970]  That is not a... I mean, that's literally the case, folks.
[01:32:58.372 --> 01:33:01.535]  Oh, I'm not just calling people that I disagree with commies.
[01:33:05.861 --> 01:33:08.504]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.066 --> 01:33:21.556]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.243]  Well, Jessica...
[01:33:54.088 --> 01:34:02.874]  Yanni is a transgender woman and is powerful LGBTQ2SIA plus activist.
[01:34:03.594 --> 01:34:07.777]  She currently ran for Miss BC and plans to run again.
[01:34:07.797 --> 01:34:09.798]  2020 lives in Canada.
[01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:12.780]  She believes strongly in human rights and equality.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.363]  She also is a well-known tech blogger and is on her 10th year running.
[01:34:18.203 --> 01:34:19.524]  TrustedNerd.com.
[01:34:20.264 --> 01:34:23.105]  And so, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:34:23.445 --> 01:34:28.467]  I know you're scheduled for you to be on The War Room with Owen Schroeder today.
[01:34:29.288 --> 01:34:32.129]  Tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:33.669]  You're all over the news.
[01:34:33.929 --> 01:34:34.870]  What your main mission is?
[01:34:35.595 --> 01:34:40.578]  Yeah, so my main mission is essentially human rights and LGBTQ equality.
[01:34:42.058 --> 01:34:54.185]  I am a transgender woman and I was really seeking gender-affirming care services when it comes to waxing, facials, pedicures, manicures, head massages.
[01:34:54.645 --> 01:35:07.635]  The whole nine yards and I was pretty distraught to see the level of discrimination that is out there when it comes to people in the LGBTQ trying to receive gender-affirming care services.
[01:35:08.255 --> 01:35:12.699]  It's horrible and I did not feel right to just let this go.
[01:35:12.719 --> 01:35:18.463]  You know, when these providers are willing to do services
[01:35:19.083 --> 01:35:32.897]  On someone who is a male, and not a transgender but an actual male, but they're unwilling to do it on a transgender woman, or even a transgender male, that just... I don't understand that.
[01:35:33.573 --> 01:35:45.577]  Okay, because I've seen articles in the UK where the National Health Service, where a nurse doesn't want to do a pap smear on a person calling themselves transgender.
[01:35:45.597 --> 01:35:46.737]  I mean, I'm a libertarian.
[01:35:46.757 --> 01:35:48.157]  Somebody wants to say they're a woman, whatever.
[01:35:48.797 --> 01:35:52.579]  But what about when there's not a cervix?
[01:35:53.839 --> 01:35:57.100]  That's like saying, you know, give me a root canal, but I don't have any teeth.
[01:35:58.206 --> 01:36:05.410]  Yeah, it's different when it comes to things like gynecology, like myself.
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:08.511]  It's a little bit embarrassing, but I do have a gynecologist.
[01:36:09.432 --> 01:36:13.914]  I have been checked, but when it comes to people that
[01:36:16.455 --> 01:36:16.936]  Yeah.
[01:36:33.729 --> 01:36:43.633]  A female doesn't need, like a biological female doesn't need to go in and get a prostate exam unless she's intersex and or has some sort of abnormality happening there.
[01:36:44.073 --> 01:36:44.774]  Let me ask you this.
[01:36:44.854 --> 01:36:47.615]  Why do you think all this transgenderism is so hot?
[01:36:48.015 --> 01:36:49.015]  Why is it just everywhere?
[01:36:49.115 --> 01:36:52.037]  Every children's show, every TV program, it's just everywhere.
[01:36:52.097 --> 01:36:52.977]  It's everywhere.
[01:36:54.389 --> 01:36:56.870]  I think it's because we live in a new day and age now.
[01:36:57.051 --> 01:37:00.592]  You know, things are not the way they used to be in the early 1990s.
[01:37:00.813 --> 01:37:13.660]  People are starting to really reaffirm their gender identity and come out as different genders, different gender expression, like genderqueer, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, non-binary.
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:18.562]  You never heard of those terms about five plus years ago.
[01:37:18.582 --> 01:37:19.603]  You never heard about this.
[01:37:20.023 --> 01:37:23.065]  But now, as things become more open and more
[01:37:24.056 --> 01:37:26.198]  Socialized, I think, I'd say.
[01:37:26.599 --> 01:37:31.524]  That's when you start to hear more and more and more of these cases happening.
[01:37:31.864 --> 01:37:32.064]  Sure.
[01:37:32.104 --> 01:37:33.005]  Let me raise this to you.
[01:37:33.445 --> 01:37:34.246]  I played football.
[01:37:34.266 --> 01:37:35.187]  I wasn't that good at it.
[01:37:36.128 --> 01:37:37.570]  But I played football.
[01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:41.894]  I was good enough when I was a freshman to be put on the varsity team and get run over and then quit the next year.
[01:37:41.914 --> 01:37:42.655]  I couldn't handle it.
[01:37:43.395 --> 01:37:45.698]  But I was good enough to get hurt real bad every game.
[01:37:47.439 --> 01:38:03.388]  I mean, I'm a tough guy, but it was still weird to pull my clothes off and, you know, and get naked around guys and the coaches would walk through and once a year they'd come in and do a test to make sure I didn't have a hernia and, you know, the coach would stick his finger, you know, where or the doctor would and I didn't like that.
[01:38:04.108 --> 01:38:06.370]  And my daughters are even more squeamish and stuff.
[01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:12.114]  You know, I have three daughters, and sometimes I walk by their room and one of them's, you know, half-naked and they freak out, oh, dad, and slam the door.
[01:38:13.275 --> 01:38:24.142]  Like Chris Cuomo said a few years ago, he said, like, 12-year-old girls should be ready to have a transgender man as a woman in the shower, and if they see his genitals, they shouldn't get upset.
[01:38:24.502 --> 01:38:25.483]  I don't think that's reasonable.
[01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:29.686]  I do, actually, because, you know,
[01:38:31.874 --> 01:38:34.999]  People want to start segregating sex.
[01:38:35.179 --> 01:38:42.830]  I don't think the average women particularly want to be around a bunch of schlongs.
[01:38:46.957 --> 01:38:48.278]  Yes and no.
[01:38:49.098 --> 01:38:50.899]  Yes and no.
[01:38:51.299 --> 01:38:52.839]  I do agree where you're getting at here.
[01:38:52.919 --> 01:38:53.460]  I do agree.
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:39:00.082]  But I do agree that everyone has equal rights when it comes to this.
[01:39:00.162 --> 01:39:03.243]  And you know, if someone wants to transition and
[01:39:04.704 --> 01:39:05.625]  Oh, I want to be clear.
[01:39:05.645 --> 01:39:12.088]  I don't hate anybody who wants to do anything they want with their body, but at the same time, I don't want to have to pay for it.
[01:39:23.644 --> 01:39:27.186]  That's where, yeah, I see where you're getting at.
[01:39:28.146 --> 01:39:39.512]  You know, there are organizations in British Columbia, where I reside, that the government here does pay for gender confirmation surgery.
[01:39:39.552 --> 01:39:48.216]  They do pay, like the medical services plan here does pay for sex reassignment surgery and breast augmentation.
[01:39:48.616 --> 01:39:52.881]  I don't think they should pay for breast augmentation for a woman, a man, a trans.
[01:39:53.001 --> 01:39:54.503]  I don't think we should pay for a nose job.
[01:39:56.305 --> 01:39:56.706]  I know.
[01:39:57.186 --> 01:39:58.648]  It's, you know...
[01:40:00.293 --> 01:40:14.583]  The way the government thinks here in regards to which people should receive which, I do have some agreement, I do have some disagreement, I have some very strong disagreements.
[01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:27.692]  For example, I did write to our Medical Services Fund, which we call MSP here, because what I found is that they will fund
[01:40:29.468 --> 01:40:30.409]  We're good
[01:40:50.134 --> 01:40:56.596]  They won't cover it unless... Well, I mean, I think if people... It should be covered if a woman has her breast removed from cancer, if she wants to have that fixed.
[01:40:57.377 --> 01:40:58.977]  Because they didn't ask for the cancer.
[01:40:58.997 --> 01:41:00.178]  But let me ask you this question.
[01:41:00.658 --> 01:41:04.859]  The latest controversy I saw was on newswars.com and summit.news.
[01:41:05.219 --> 01:41:11.762]  Trans activist organizes topless swimming session for girls as young as 12, parents not allowed to be present.
[01:41:11.802 --> 01:41:12.802]  Is that an accurate headline?
[01:41:13.402 --> 01:41:13.723]  That is.
[01:41:15.183 --> 01:41:16.664]  Not exactly.
[01:41:17.825 --> 01:41:18.566]  Not exactly.
[01:41:18.666 --> 01:41:23.189]  I'm going to explain what exactly is going on with this event.
[01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:30.774]  So there was an event that was planned in the city of Langley that was unfortunately shut down by anti-LGBTQ activists.
[01:41:35.578 --> 01:41:38.861]  And I was pretty distraught when I saw this.
[01:41:38.881 --> 01:41:41.664]  You know, everyone has the right to have their own event.
[01:41:41.684 --> 01:41:44.147]  You know, being topless is legal in Canada.
[01:41:44.467 --> 01:41:49.813]  The actual event organizers are the ones that came up with this event.
[01:41:49.853 --> 01:41:55.679]  That being the Langley Youth Resource Hub, to my recollection, because they're the ones that are being asked to
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.360]  Call them for info.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:09.244]  And essentially with this, the event proposed that people would be able to be topless from age 12 to 24.
[01:42:10.344 --> 01:42:14.205]  It's all up to their discretion and what they want.
[01:42:14.425 --> 01:42:18.927]  And as you can see, that's the original event.
[01:42:20.967 --> 01:42:23.408]  But what happens if an older person identifies as a 12-year-old?
[01:42:24.829 --> 01:42:25.849]  We have that too, right?
[01:42:26.932 --> 01:42:27.592]  That's true.
[01:42:27.652 --> 01:42:39.079]  You know, we cannot be going around and policing gender or policing people by their age.
[01:42:39.099 --> 01:42:43.581]  If someone says they are a 12-year-old... What if they say they're blind and dump Drano in their eyes, though?
[01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:44.242]  Should we pay for that?
[01:42:45.106 --> 01:42:45.486]  I'm sorry?
[01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:47.326]  Let's talk about Transabled.
[01:42:47.826 --> 01:42:50.147]  I appreciate you coming on.
[01:42:50.187 --> 01:42:52.887]  Most folks that we argue with will not actually come on.
[01:42:52.907 --> 01:42:55.288]  This is an amazing show.
[01:42:55.988 --> 01:43:00.349]  And I also want to see if you want to go out on a date.
[01:43:00.489 --> 01:43:01.629]  I'll stay with this lovely lady.
[01:43:02.289 --> 01:43:13.391]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks in to people.
[01:43:14.835 --> 01:43:30.531]  I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, and that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.684]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[01:43:35.704 --> 01:43:39.227]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[01:43:39.587 --> 01:43:41.189]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:46.433]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:43:46.493 --> 01:43:54.380]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.962]  But then they say, you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:43:57.122 --> 01:43:58.863]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[01:43:58.983 --> 01:44:01.105]  If you don't have iodine in your body, you end up dying.
[01:44:01.185 --> 01:44:02.686]  If you don't have water, you end up dying.
[01:44:02.766 --> 01:44:04.948]  If you don't have sunshine, if you don't have oxygen, you die.
[01:44:05.028 --> 01:44:07.169]  It may take 10 years with no sunshine, but you die.
[01:44:07.309 --> 01:44:19.078]  And if you don't have a whole bunch of minerals and a whole bunch of vitamins and in the organic system where you can upload them, you will end up getting degenerative diseases quicker than you would have and you will die.
[01:44:19.358 --> 01:44:24.200]  And all drugs are, is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it, do different things.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:25.361]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:44:25.441 --> 01:44:27.242]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature.
[01:44:27.382 --> 01:44:29.463]  I mean, there are some things in Mother Nature you take too much of.
[01:44:29.503 --> 01:44:31.484]  You'll have a side effect, but nothing like Big Pharma.
[01:44:31.564 --> 01:44:35.285]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:44:35.805 --> 01:44:45.810]  And so, they sit there and they demonize us all day long when we sell things like Ultimate Bone Broth, that's chaga mushroom, incredibly concentrated, high-quality turmeric, and a bunch of other bee pollen.
[01:44:45.930 --> 01:44:47.011]  This is the strongest bone broth out there.
[01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:52.613]  Mixed with organic, concentrated chicken bones that are rendered down where there's no way to quantify it.
[01:44:52.633 --> 01:44:54.414]  But this is the strongest bone broth out there.
[01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:55.795]  You can make broth with this.
[01:44:55.955 --> 01:44:57.016]  You can put it in brownies.
[01:44:57.076 --> 01:44:59.817]  But I mix it with whey and put some fruit in it, and then it tastes great.
[01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:04.439]  The point is, is it's concentrated, it's uber strong, and it is amazing.
[01:45:04.499 --> 01:45:05.240]  Experience it.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.600]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.601]  And we are unstoppable thanks to you.
[01:45:14.324 --> 01:45:23.490]  Get in there today and fund the operation and watch this fight against the globalists continue on because they're doing everything they can to shut us down and thanks to you, failing!
[01:45:41.869 --> 01:45:44.991]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:45:45.071 --> 01:45:49.935]  And I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[01:45:49.995 --> 01:45:50.656]  Changed my life.
[01:45:50.736 --> 01:45:53.178]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[01:45:53.218 --> 01:45:54.939]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[01:45:55.179 --> 01:45:58.342]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body.
[01:45:58.402 --> 01:46:02.505]  And I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on it.
[01:46:02.745 --> 01:46:09.667]  I tried your DNA Force a couple weeks later, started feeling that numbness going away, tingling coming back, and then, you know, now I'm fully using my hand.
[01:46:09.707 --> 01:46:14.308]  It's great, and I can't thank you enough for what you do, just in the fight for liberty.
[01:46:14.408 --> 01:46:15.208]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:46:15.288 --> 01:46:16.808]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[01:46:16.828 --> 01:46:23.409]  You want to order it again, but PQQ CoQ10's been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[01:46:23.549 --> 01:46:25.730]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:29.091]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[01:46:29.651 --> 01:46:30.271]  What'd you think of the X2?
[01:46:30.811 --> 01:46:31.652]  I love that too.
[01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:35.915]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[01:46:36.315 --> 01:46:44.981]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but you feel like you want to get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't find the word to say.
[01:46:45.121 --> 01:46:48.223]  And I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[01:46:48.263 --> 01:46:50.985]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[01:46:51.005 --> 01:46:51.786]  It's electrochemical.
[01:46:51.826 --> 01:46:52.566]  You're absolutely right.
[01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:56.309]  When I forget to take X2 every couple of days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[01:46:56.449 --> 01:46:58.991]  Then I feel it and I take it and it really is amazing.
[01:46:59.071 --> 01:47:00.312]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[01:47:06.761 --> 01:47:09.503]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.876 --> 01:47:28.938]  Jessica Yanov is a transgender from Canada.
[01:47:30.419 --> 01:47:33.562]  And we only got this segment, maybe one more, so we gotta move quickly here.
[01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:36.370]  I want to break this down.
[01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:46.294]  We have photos here and articles with you at these events.
[01:47:46.454 --> 01:47:53.617]  What are these events where you're in bathrooms and I've got some of the tweets here and some of the things that you say here.
[01:47:53.977 --> 01:47:55.177]  What is this activism?
[01:47:55.217 --> 01:47:56.058]  What are you doing here?
[01:47:56.638 --> 01:48:04.461]  Yeah, all of those tweets except for that middle one over there and the ones on the right are all fake, essentially.
[01:48:05.839 --> 01:48:10.010]  Well, that's why I appreciate you coming on, because, you know, you're quite the sensation online.
[01:48:10.311 --> 01:48:11.895]  This way you get to actually say something.
[01:48:12.796 --> 01:48:16.198]  Yeah, I'm still trying to figure out who did this.
[01:48:17.319 --> 01:48:22.903]  I am presuming that this is an anti-LGBTQ activist.
[01:48:23.384 --> 01:48:29.848]  I kind of have my suspicions on who it is, but I'm not going to say exactly who, because I can't.
[01:48:30.068 --> 01:48:31.810]  But no, I didn't write any of that.
[01:48:31.930 --> 01:48:33.311]  Sure, sure.
[01:48:33.331 --> 01:48:37.153]  What did you mean earlier by, you can't discriminate by age?
[01:48:37.233 --> 01:48:37.814]  What does that mean?
[01:48:38.601 --> 01:48:43.330]  Well, what I mean by that is, I'm going to give you an example.
[01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:46.676]  Last night my mom tried to book me for a facial.
[01:48:49.338 --> 01:48:58.244]  What happened with that is the person on the other side then asked her, how old is your transgender daughter?
[01:48:58.964 --> 01:48:59.925]  To which she replied, 32.
[01:48:59.965 --> 01:49:04.508]  And then both of us were refused service.
[01:49:04.608 --> 01:49:14.254]  Not only on several protected grounds, actually, and this is going to go before the tribunal, but essentially on family status.
[01:49:16.235 --> 01:49:21.576]  Gender identity and expression, sex, and also age as well.
[01:49:21.876 --> 01:49:23.476]  I'm just asking a question.
[01:49:23.576 --> 01:49:32.798]  If you're a woman, because I'm not big into, I might have had one pedicure, one manicure in my life, and I've been on a cruise before with my ex-wife, and they said, hey, you want his and hers facials.
[01:49:32.818 --> 01:49:35.438]  They did this facial, put cream on my face, and did all this.
[01:49:35.939 --> 01:49:38.319]  I mean, they weren't asking man or woman, they just said you want a facial.
[01:49:38.679 --> 01:49:44.080]  So how does this, I don't even get how they're, like you're on the line, I'm a transgender, I'm getting a facial, and they're like, no, I mean,
[01:49:45.655 --> 01:49:46.275]  Exactly.
[01:49:47.496 --> 01:50:06.165]  The problem that we have where I reside is there's quite racialized cultural groups here that do not believe in transgenderism, and they believe that they have the right to review service on any basis that they want.
[01:50:07.146 --> 01:50:13.249]  Oh, let me guess, because I'd say 70% of the nails and facial stuff, is it Vietnamese or Asians?
[01:50:14.584 --> 01:50:16.725]  Uh, it's kind of a mix.
[01:50:17.066 --> 01:50:25.931]  It's like, like the way I explain it to the tribunal is when you deal with things like waxing, it's usually Vietnamese or East Indian or Taiwanese.
[01:50:26.091 --> 01:50:34.976]  You know, in their culture, they're not, or any culture, you're not supposed to touch anybody's, if you're a woman, you're not supposed to touch another man's penis unless it's your husband.
[01:50:35.576 --> 01:50:38.178]  I know, but since when do we have a penis on our forehead?
[01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:41.021]  So, I don't understand that.
[01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:48.669]  Why would we want to make a woman, I'm just asking, why would we want to make a woman, if it's her religious or cultural thing, that maybe she's been with one man in her life.
[01:50:48.689 --> 01:50:54.074]  I mean most, even wild women I've known, you know, right away aren't just ready to jump in the sack.
[01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:57.357]  Well then how do you think a woman is ready to touch your, I just don't get that.
[01:50:59.199 --> 01:50:59.680]  But you see,
[01:51:01.585 --> 01:51:02.165]  Here's the thing.
[01:51:02.405 --> 01:51:18.397]  If we start refusing people for things such as facials just because we claim religion, then we run into a very, very, very dangerous president.
[01:51:18.417 --> 01:51:19.357]  You're saying facials.
[01:51:19.397 --> 01:51:23.700]  The case I saw was you wanted a bikini wax on your testicles, correct?
[01:51:23.901 --> 01:51:27.003]  And I also wanted an arm wax too and I got refused service because
[01:51:27.843 --> 01:51:36.151]  Because the respondents claim that they're Sikh and that their husband will not allow them to do service on a biological man.
[01:51:36.171 --> 01:51:40.154]  You see, this is... Listen, I don't want my wife touching other men's genitals.
[01:51:41.335 --> 01:51:43.777]  No, no, not about the genitals.
[01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.539]  What if my wife did bikini waxes?
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:46.440]  Yeah.
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:54.467]  Okay, and what if she did that and then a dude, you know, a man comes in who says he's a woman and then he wants my wife to polish his Johnson?
[01:51:57.653 --> 01:52:06.179]  You know, in this day and age, with the BC Human Rights Code and the Caning Human Rights Code, if someone identifies as a woman, they have to receive those gender-affirming care services.
[01:52:06.499 --> 01:52:08.180]  That's the law.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.902]  I don't think this is going to work out well, because here's my deal.
[01:52:11.022 --> 01:52:18.827]  I don't mind and I don't hate somebody if they are a man who feels like they're a woman and their brain might be feminine or something and there's genetics in it or whatever.
[01:52:19.087 --> 01:52:20.288]  There's some evidence that's going on.
[01:52:21.028 --> 01:52:31.495]  I don't hate anybody, but when they try to make other people comport to what they want, like almost all the sprinting, almost all the powerlifting from Australia to the U.S.
[01:52:31.515 --> 01:52:36.818]  to Canada is being won by biological men who have twice the size bones, twice the muscle on average.
[01:52:37.058 --> 01:52:39.900]  They even have their genitals, so they have testosterone.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:47.685]  Well, biological men are going to win every competition in the world now, rendering women's sports obsolete.
[01:52:48.425 --> 01:52:58.569]  Whether it's basketball or football or hockey, it'll be all biological men, nice pretty hair, nice fingernails, but it'll be biological men and women will be obsolete in sports.
[01:52:58.649 --> 01:52:59.770]  Is that inclusive?
[01:53:00.885 --> 01:53:05.066]  No, and that's actually where I agree with you.
[01:53:05.126 --> 01:53:24.111]  When it comes to things such as sporting competitions and such, and I had quite a discussion about this with a good friend of mine named Lynn, especially in regards to the article you just pulled up.
[01:53:24.411 --> 01:53:30.252]  I don't agree with transgender identifying individuals going into sports
[01:53:31.312 --> 01:53:37.776]  And winning competitions when they still have a heavy, heavy, heavy level of testosterone.
[01:53:38.156 --> 01:53:40.057]  And I'm going to give you an example here.
[01:53:40.737 --> 01:53:45.200]  Before I transitioned, I had quite a high testosterone level.
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:48.182]  And then I started hormone replacement therapy.
[01:53:48.662 --> 01:53:55.246]  And when you start hormone replacement therapy, those pills essentially eliminate your testosterone.
[01:53:55.386 --> 01:53:58.788]  Like what I had as was a level 14, I now have a level of 1.2.
[01:54:00.459 --> 01:54:01.140]  I don't
[01:54:14.079 --> 01:54:34.628]  Below a certain number, not being like below four or even below... Well, the health... But I don't agree with transgender females pumping themselves up with testosterone to even get above what a biological male would, because that gets into risky territory.
[01:54:34.928 --> 01:54:39.590]  I've heard of cases where people are breaking necks, breaking bones, breaking everything.
[01:54:40.851 --> 01:54:44.894]  I'll say this, humans change their environment, we build our own structures, we change ourselves.
[01:54:45.214 --> 01:54:45.995]  That's a human trait.
[01:54:46.675 --> 01:54:54.782]  But the whole trans movement beyond changing sex is getting us ready for brain chips, Elon Musk, merging with computers, and it's being pushed.
[01:54:55.302 --> 01:54:59.926]  And so the whole eugenics movement is using the trans movement as kind of a way to open the door.
[01:55:00.286 --> 01:55:01.928]  But let's get into this, and I appreciate you joining us.
[01:55:02.568 --> 01:55:03.048]  What about
[01:55:03.889 --> 01:55:04.769]  Some of these other articles.
[01:55:04.789 --> 01:55:06.010]  I mean, describe to me, where are you?
[01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:07.810]  You say you're in a bathroom or is that fake too?
[01:55:08.410 --> 01:55:14.132]  Where you're taking photos of women or young women inside bathrooms.
[01:55:14.612 --> 01:55:25.755]  That photo that you actually referred to was taken literally, literally like the day that I switched my gender to legally the female.
[01:55:26.856 --> 01:55:28.996]  I was stupid and I shared that on a group.
[01:55:29.816 --> 01:55:31.717]  I actually shared it on a group that
[01:55:32.702 --> 01:55:36.744]  I kind of knew I would get attacked, but I did it anyway because I was stupid.
[01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:41.346]  What essentially happened with that is what you see there.
[01:55:41.707 --> 01:55:46.489]  People took it and they, let me like call it the rant room if I remember correctly.
[01:55:46.849 --> 01:55:48.470]  So did you tweak this right here?
[01:55:49.371 --> 01:55:49.571]  Nope.
[01:55:51.912 --> 01:55:52.112]  Nope.
[01:55:52.732 --> 01:55:53.173]  Not at all.
[01:55:54.433 --> 01:55:55.754]  But you did take the photos.
[01:55:56.374 --> 01:55:57.014]  Why would I?
[01:55:57.255 --> 01:55:57.775]  That's the thing.
[01:56:00.808 --> 01:56:02.349]  Okay, well I'm sure you're familiar.
[01:56:02.389 --> 01:56:03.589]  Are you familiar with the work I do?
[01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:06.891]  I am.
[01:56:06.991 --> 01:56:08.392]  So why did you decide to come on here?
[01:56:08.432 --> 01:56:13.654]  Because let me tell you, nobody on the left, or whatever you want to call it, will come on here.
[01:56:13.674 --> 01:56:16.375]  They come on Tucker's show, and I just want to hear what people have to say.
[01:56:17.156 --> 01:56:26.720]  Because, you know, I'm not ashamed of who I am, and that's why I watch your show, and that's why I thought, you know, I'm going to come on this show, because there's a lot of issues here.
[01:56:27.684 --> 01:56:50.723]  There's a lot of serious issues that come into play and the most serious issue and the reason for all these complaints is this is not about waxing, this is not about gender affirmative care, this is about the ability for someone to refuse service to anyone that they want because of what they want, even if that person belongs to a protected class.
[01:56:50.763 --> 01:56:56.648]  For example, if you have a cop that walks into a donut shop
[01:56:57.448 --> 01:57:02.451]  And the donut shop owner says, no, I don't want to serve you because you're a cop.
[01:57:02.471 --> 01:57:04.192]  That would technically be... Sure, that's wrong.
[01:57:04.752 --> 01:57:11.515]  But it's not if the cop walked in and said, wax my male genitals.
[01:57:12.015 --> 01:57:12.616]  I'm a woman.
[01:57:12.636 --> 01:57:13.856]  That would be a little different.
[01:57:14.637 --> 01:57:16.798]  But okay, let me ask you this.
[01:57:17.398 --> 01:57:20.940]  What's your perspective on being rejected for an arm wax?
[01:57:22.208 --> 01:57:24.369]  Like, literally something that is sticking out there.
[01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:25.449]  Everyone sees it.
[01:57:25.509 --> 01:57:27.150]  It's not hidden in your pants.
[01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:39.876]  What's your, um... What's your... But if the Vietnamese women have had one man they've been with... I mean, women, even if a woman's a slut, she doesn't just randomly want guys to pull their ding-dong out.
[01:57:40.136 --> 01:57:41.036]  They want to be involved.
[01:57:41.056 --> 01:57:41.917]  They want to be in charge.
[01:57:41.937 --> 01:57:42.557]  They want to be in control.
[01:57:42.777 --> 01:57:43.738]  It's a power thing.
[01:57:44.098 --> 01:57:49.980]  To make a woman shave your testicles and wax your ding-dong is abusive, in my view.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.401]  Come back and let me get your take on that.
[01:57:57.398 --> 01:58:03.724]  There's one thing the establishment hates more than anything else, and that's human interaction between the media and the people.
[01:58:04.185 --> 01:58:09.109]  The entire corporate, globalist, New World Order combine is about making you feel powerless.
[01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:16.136]  And the media telling you America sucks, God sucks, the family sucks, the Second Amendment sucks, freedom is terrible.
[01:58:16.577 --> 01:58:17.538]  It's making you feel alone.
[01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:19.491]  The truth is, you're not alone.
[01:58:20.111 --> 01:58:21.972]  Freedom worldwide is exploding.
[01:58:22.132 --> 01:58:23.493]  It doesn't matter what color your skin is.
[01:58:23.974 --> 01:58:25.154]  People want justice.
[01:58:25.715 --> 01:58:28.637]  So we have Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[01:58:29.497 --> 01:58:44.687]  And in the private messages to me, I'm going to start every day, six days a week when I do the regular radio TV show that reaches millions, to answer your questions, be they political, be they personal, any question goes as long as they're not a joke.
[01:58:45.187 --> 01:58:46.048]  Or maybe they are a joke.
[01:58:47.208 --> 01:58:52.091]  As long as they're serious in some way, I will answer your questions on air.
[01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:54.072]  Wolfgar, shout out to you.
[01:58:54.092 --> 01:59:02.257]  Q Master, Raymond Alameda, Retired Army, Gregory Needles, Joseph Rulo, VP Wu and others.
[01:59:03.218 --> 01:59:05.659]  You come, you donate, you support.
[01:59:06.199 --> 01:59:10.522]  I answer your questions on air because I respect the fact that you put skin in the game.
[01:59:11.491 --> 01:59:15.474]  So, Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[01:59:15.954 --> 01:59:21.478]  You go right there, you ask your questions, and if you are a subscriber, I will answer them.
[01:59:21.498 --> 01:59:24.960]  A lot of other perks as well, but the system wants to keep us apart.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:27.782]  They want to keep the media from being interactive with the people.
[01:59:28.202 --> 01:59:29.323]  We want to be transparent.
[01:59:29.343 --> 01:59:31.424]  We want to be absolutely clear.
[01:59:31.865 --> 01:59:33.066]  We want to empower
[01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.587]  We the people, because that's all of us together.
[01:59:35.947 --> 01:59:39.850]  I'll see you all with your questions daily, Monday through Friday and Sundays.
[01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:45.934]  Every day I'll answer Subscribestar questions at Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[01:59:46.395 --> 01:59:51.078]  I'll see you there.
[01:59:56.401 --> 02:00:00.304]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:18.580]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:19.361 --> 02:00:20.642]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.184 --> 02:00:31.190]  Jessica Ianov is a transgender, male to female, and he's coming on the show, so I'm being nice here.
[02:00:32.576 --> 02:00:36.902]  But we've got a esthetician here that's also trained to be a producer, doing a great job.
[02:00:37.402 --> 02:00:43.049]  Becca, she was explaining that what you're trained to do, she says she's done, you know, waxing of men.
[02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.890]  Men get that.
[02:00:44.711 --> 02:00:45.673]  It's totally different.
[02:00:45.973 --> 02:00:46.614]  You've got to be trained.
[02:00:46.634 --> 02:00:47.335]  That's a whole other issue.
[02:00:47.355 --> 02:00:48.376]  She's going to pop in in a moment.
[02:00:48.816 --> 02:00:50.158]  But what about these articles?
[02:00:51.095 --> 02:00:55.217]  That say you're just a predator that wants to get around young girls.
[02:00:55.237 --> 02:00:56.378]  What about exclusive?
[02:00:56.438 --> 02:01:00.641]  15 year old alleged victim of you supposedly speaks out.
[02:01:00.661 --> 02:01:03.802]  It's a big article out of the Post Millennial.
[02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:13.328]  You're going to these courts, you're saying these people are abusing you, not waxing you, but other people are stepping forward saying that, hey, you know, we're being harassed by this person.
[02:01:13.968 --> 02:01:14.749]  What's your take on that?
[02:01:15.569 --> 02:01:30.200]  You know, one thing I want to say about the Postmillennial is it's to my understanding that the council, the owner of the law firm that is counsel to the respondents owns the Postmillennial.com.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.224]  They have published defamatory articles about me day in and day out.
[02:01:36.265 --> 02:01:42.330]  But I really want to get to something important here because I do believe that this is important.
[02:01:43.451 --> 02:01:56.157]  Going back to the refusal of service, you know, they, they're essentially saying that, you know, we won't do service on a man or transgender, but transgender also means female to male.
[02:01:56.437 --> 02:02:06.181]  I have a friend, her name is, his name is Taylor, and he, you know, he, he's female to male.
[02:02:06.541 --> 02:02:12.804]  So what's essentially happening here is they are also refusing service on transgender males
[02:02:13.917 --> 02:02:17.462]  Let me raise this.
[02:02:17.562 --> 02:02:22.349]  You have record levels of autism and record levels of suicide and mental illness and transgendered.
[02:02:22.770 --> 02:02:25.854]  A lot of people don't want to deal with a mental health issue.
[02:02:27.917 --> 02:02:28.298]  What do you mean?
[02:02:29.485 --> 02:02:32.466]  Well, you're actually well-spoken and holding your own.
[02:02:32.546 --> 02:02:36.447]  But, I mean, a lot of times you see a crazy transgender bank robber.
[02:02:36.467 --> 02:02:45.429]  I mean, the statistics are there that there are a lot of autistic people and stuff that end up getting tricked when they're young to being, quote, under-sexed.
[02:02:45.449 --> 02:02:50.210]  Let's bring in Becca, who is a skin expert, that's what, esthetician.
[02:02:50.651 --> 02:02:51.971]  She wanted to say something.
[02:02:51.991 --> 02:02:52.231]  Go ahead.
[02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:54.250]  Hey, Jessica.
[02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.991]  Nice to meet you.
[02:02:55.011 --> 02:02:55.911]  Hey.
[02:02:56.151 --> 02:02:56.431]  Hi.
[02:02:56.651 --> 02:03:02.253]  So, working as an esthetician for 10 years, I actually worked in San Francisco, so I had a lot of male clientele.
[02:03:03.574 --> 02:03:10.816]  Gay people, straight people, transgender, I've done it all, and I know I was actually pretty rare in the industry.
[02:03:10.937 --> 02:03:14.478]  There's not a lot of people that do that type of service.
[02:03:14.538 --> 02:03:21.921]  I'm just wondering if it's an actual discrimination issue or if you just encountered someone who was not trained in that service.
[02:03:22.001 --> 02:03:22.421]  I mean, it is
[02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:23.702]  Quite different.
[02:03:24.062 --> 02:03:25.724]  There's a lot of different training involved.
[02:03:26.145 --> 02:03:27.186]  Have you considered that?
[02:03:28.187 --> 02:03:33.253]  Well, I've approached 16 different places asking for waxing.
[02:03:34.356 --> 02:03:37.477]  And every single one of them refused service.
[02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:45.058]  Now, I do want to state, like, I do have an expert witness joining me for my hearing on the 26th.
[02:03:45.478 --> 02:03:49.099]  That is an uncontested hearing that's clumped with three people.
[02:03:49.139 --> 02:03:50.519]  But hold on, we got to have you back on.
[02:03:50.539 --> 02:03:51.520]  You're on the war room today.
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:54.380]  I think Becca should go on with Owen Schroeder to keep the discussion going.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.880]  Jessica, let me just say this.
[02:03:56.301 --> 02:04:01.762]  Isn't it a first world problem that you're having to sue over women won't wax your
[02:04:05.625 --> 02:04:19.901]  There's one really important fact here that I want to bring up, and I want Becca to affirm this, that a Brazilian is not gender assigned, meaning it's not implicitly female.
[02:04:20.141 --> 02:04:21.683]  Jessica, would you wax my butt?
[02:04:23.496 --> 02:04:33.138]  What a Brazilian wax means, what a Brazilian wax is, is a wax from the belly button down to the anus, and it's removing hair.
[02:04:33.178 --> 02:04:34.198]  I can't do this anymore.
[02:04:34.298 --> 02:04:34.618]  Hold on.
[02:04:34.638 --> 02:04:35.718]  You're going to be on the war room, right?
[02:04:35.738 --> 02:04:36.958]  You agreed to come on with Owen Schroer.
[02:04:38.078 --> 02:04:39.679]  You're coming up in a couple hours on there, right?
[02:04:40.979 --> 02:04:41.359]  I'm sorry?
[02:04:41.379 --> 02:04:43.199]  You're going to be on the Owen Schroer Show?
[02:04:43.839 --> 02:04:44.260]  Yeah, I am.
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.680]  Okay, Becca, you want to come on with him so you can finish up today?
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:47.560]  I would love to.
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:48.300]  Yes, definitely.
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.360]  She's going to be on with Owen Schroer.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.541]  What time are you on?
[02:04:50.561 --> 02:04:51.741]  I believe 2.30, my time.
[02:04:53.277 --> 02:04:56.479]  Okay, so that's like 4.30 today.
[02:04:56.819 --> 02:04:57.939]  This is going to continue.
[02:04:58.399 --> 02:04:59.860]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.901]  Lord Monk is coming up.
[02:05:00.941 --> 02:05:01.641]  Thank you, Becca.
[02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:11.386]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:11.426 --> 02:05:18.549]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:18.789 --> 02:05:22.291]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[02:05:22.691 --> 02:05:26.175]  Tell-O-Meres and Tell-O-Mere support with your DNA.
[02:05:26.556 --> 02:05:34.945]  So I started to look into the science and what Tell-O-Meres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your Tell-O-Meres.
[02:05:34.985 --> 02:05:37.128]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but
[02:05:37.628 --> 02:05:38.308]  It's expensive.
[02:05:38.388 --> 02:05:38.648]  Why?
[02:05:38.708 --> 02:05:41.209]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[02:05:41.489 --> 02:05:48.430]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went.
[02:05:48.770 --> 02:05:51.471]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[02:05:51.811 --> 02:05:53.051]  It is the elite supplement.
[02:05:53.491 --> 02:05:57.112]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[02:05:57.152 --> 02:06:03.013]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:06:26.502 --> 02:06:44.647]  Well, joining us is Lord Christopher Monckton, and without him, we would definitely have a global carbon tax, what would be the heart of a world government surveillance, control, and taxation system, with courts empowered to shut down businesses, you name it.
[02:06:45.247 --> 02:06:49.388]  Well, there's been some huge scientific studies that have come out in the last month that have gotten almost no attention.
[02:06:49.428 --> 02:06:50.148]  I've seen four of them.
[02:06:50.948 --> 02:06:52.429]  And Lord Moncton is going to be in D.C.
[02:06:52.449 --> 02:06:53.549]  for a critical meeting.
[02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:54.470]  He takes off tomorrow.
[02:06:54.770 --> 02:06:55.790]  He's going to be there Friday.
[02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:57.051]  We're going to be talking to him then.
[02:06:57.071 --> 02:06:59.031]  We're going to be getting the latest throughout the weekend.
[02:06:59.452 --> 02:07:12.317]  But I really appreciate him coming on to give us an update on the latest, because if it wasn't for Lord Moncton, and if it wasn't for some of the other folks that are out there, we would be up the creek without a paddle.
[02:07:12.357 --> 02:07:15.178]  And his best website is whatsupwiththat.com.
[02:07:15.498 --> 02:07:20.300]  So, Lord Christopher Moncton, thank you for helping us not already be in a new dark age.
[02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:23.575]  Well, Alex, it's wonderful to be with you again.
[02:07:24.315 --> 02:07:27.438]  And yes, I will be in Washington, D.C.
[02:07:27.798 --> 02:07:30.300]  at the Trump International Hotel.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:40.608]  I arrive there tomorrow and I speak there at the lunchtime keynote speech at the 13th Heartland International Climate Conference.
[02:07:41.088 --> 02:07:53.072]  And this is a great gathering of the clans, all the gallant climate scientists who have put up with the vilification of the hard left over the years and have continued quietly to do their research.
[02:07:53.433 --> 02:07:54.493]  They'll all be there.
[02:07:55.316 --> 02:08:06.103]  So if you haven't booked yet, then get on to heartland.org and make sure you make a last-minute booking and get yourself to the Trump International Hotel, Washington DC.
[02:08:06.443 --> 02:08:10.865]  The conference starts at 8 in the morning on Thursday the 25th and runs all day.
[02:08:11.506 --> 02:08:13.107]  And I'll be speaking at lunchtime.
[02:08:13.127 --> 02:08:14.868]  I've got the half-hour lunchtime slot.
[02:08:15.308 --> 02:08:18.050]  And what I'll be doing, Alex, is explaining to
[02:08:19.159 --> 02:08:36.908]  The eminent climate scientists and researchers who are there, that a team of 10 scientists led by me, including three professors, has identified and can now prove that the climate scientists made a mistake 40 years ago.
[02:08:36.928 --> 02:08:39.330]  It was actually a communist at NASA who made the mistake.
[02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:41.791]  We've tracked it down, who it was and how he did it.
[02:08:42.521 --> 02:08:51.448]  And that mistake means that they have multiplied all their mid-range best estimates of how much global warming we might cause by three.
[02:08:52.029 --> 02:08:56.653]  So if you correct for the error, the global warming problem disappears.
[02:08:57.313 --> 02:09:05.480]  And in my half-hour talk tomorrow, I'm going to be explaining just enough about what we've found so that any scientist looking at it
[02:09:06.184 --> 02:09:10.792]  can go and check with his colleagues and say, are these people right or aren't they?
[02:09:11.113 --> 02:09:14.880]  And the answer is going to be, well, we certainly can't rule it out.
[02:09:15.951 --> 02:09:20.996]  We think we're very close now to bringing this whole climate scare finally to an end.
[02:09:21.016 --> 02:09:24.359]  Well that's very exciting but I want to get the 35,000 foot view as well.
[02:09:24.399 --> 02:09:35.430]  I also saw articles out of NASA the last year where they went actually carbon dioxide is helping plants grow and actually the temperature looks like it's actually not just stopped it's slowing.
[02:09:35.450 --> 02:09:40.155]  I mean I suddenly see NASA basically agreeing with all the mainline scientists.
[02:09:41.471 --> 02:09:43.172]  This is a very interesting development.
[02:09:43.192 --> 02:09:50.996]  For some time, NASA satellites have been showing, and you've got the slide up there now, that the Earth is greening.
[02:09:51.077 --> 02:10:01.282]  And this is called the net primary productivity of plants, which is a long phrase for the total biomass of all the trees and plants on Earth.
[02:10:01.342 --> 02:10:11.268]  Notwithstanding all you hear about deforestation and land clearance and so on, there is actually more green stuff, about 15% to 30% more, depending on which research paper you
[02:10:11.308 --> 02:10:14.970]  When I used to come to Austin to visit my grandmother, it looked like a desert.
[02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:16.951]  It looks like the Brazil now.
[02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:19.652]  Well, this, of course, is the wonderful thing.
[02:10:19.672 --> 02:10:26.456]  What is happening is that the CO2 in the atmosphere was too little to be good for plants.
[02:10:26.896 --> 02:10:29.738]  And now they're beginning to be able to breathe more easily.
[02:10:30.198 --> 02:10:31.719]  And this has two effects.
[02:10:31.759 --> 02:10:33.920]  You've got some very good illustrations there on the screen.
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:35.100]  It has two effects.
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:38.522]  The first thing it does is that it fertilizes the plants.
[02:10:38.562 --> 02:10:39.743]  CO2 is plant food.
[02:10:40.223 --> 02:10:47.053]  You won't hear this from Greenpeace and all the communist extremists, but CO2 is plant food.
[02:10:47.473 --> 02:10:52.100]  The carbon in the tree trunks, for instance, doesn't come from the ground.
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:54.323]  It comes from the CO2 in the air.
[02:10:54.603 --> 02:10:56.506]  And there was almost not enough of it there.
[02:10:57.006 --> 02:11:09.190]  So the fact that we've now pushed up the concentration of CO2 by about 40% over the last hundred years, plants and trees are absolutely loving this because that's what makes them... And that's how the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:09.890]  Talk about this.
[02:11:10.170 --> 02:11:11.070]  They've studied Mars.
[02:11:11.551 --> 02:11:16.892]  They probably lost its atmosphere and its oceans because it couldn't hold them in, and we would have gotten in that position.
[02:11:16.932 --> 02:11:19.673]  I mean, we're at one of the lowest points of CO2 in history, correct?
[02:11:19.973 --> 02:11:20.853]  Until this little bump.
[02:11:20.873 --> 02:11:21.534]  This was a godsend!
[02:11:22.534 --> 02:11:22.974]  And that's key.
[02:11:22.994 --> 02:11:23.734]  It was stored in the crust.
[02:11:23.834 --> 02:11:25.415]  We now bring it back up and reboot the planet.
[02:11:25.455 --> 02:11:26.055]  That's got to be God.
[02:11:52.952 --> 02:11:56.735]  Well, it is certainly carrying out God's work, let's say.
[02:11:57.056 --> 02:12:09.786]  We are restoring what nature had begun to take away, and we're making it possible for life to continue and flourish much more luxuriantly on Earth than it could otherwise have done.
[02:12:10.107 --> 02:12:10.807]  And you're quite right.
[02:12:10.827 --> 02:12:12.749]  I mean, we just take the Sahara, for instance.
[02:12:13.069 --> 02:12:19.054]  As far back as 1981, Nicholson et al., a team of scientists, reported that 300,000 square kilometers
[02:12:21.056 --> 02:12:30.067]  of what had been sandy desert had been turned green by the extra water vapour in the air, which you get if the air gets a little bit warmer worldwide.
[02:12:30.427 --> 02:12:40.980]  This extra water vapour helps the plants and likewise when there's more CO2 in the air, the stomata, which are the little mouths on the underside of the leaves,
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:46.344]  Which allow the plants to breathe in the CO2 but they also lose water through their stomata.
[02:12:46.644 --> 02:12:53.529]  They don't need so many of them and the plants are already adapting by growing fewer stomata because there's now more CO2.
[02:12:53.889 --> 02:12:59.573]  That means they lose less of the water they do get when it rains and that means you get a double effect.
[02:13:00.033 --> 02:13:06.757]  of preserving plants and trees in areas where it was, only 40 years ago, far too arid for them to survive.
[02:13:06.777 --> 02:13:07.677]  And that's so critical.
[02:13:07.717 --> 02:13:17.183]  That means that drought areas, higher CO2, and I've seen the studies, it was like some plants can have half as much water, I was reading, as long as CO2's a little bit higher, and they don't die.
[02:13:18.115 --> 02:13:23.723]  If we could double the CO2 in the air, drought virtually worldwide would cease to be a problem.
[02:13:24.063 --> 02:13:26.126]  It's already declining quite sharply.
[02:13:26.146 --> 02:13:32.554]  I mean, the Palmer Drought Severity Index, which measures the overall severity of drought around the world,
[02:13:33.416 --> 02:13:35.218]  Hasn't changed in a hundred years.
[02:13:35.258 --> 02:13:43.008]  But what has changed in the last 40 years is that the area of land under drought has declined.
[02:13:43.348 --> 02:13:45.912]  There's less and less drought happening.
[02:13:46.292 --> 02:13:49.556]  And the reason for this is the CO2 in the air.
[02:13:49.977 --> 02:13:53.399]  Well sure, when I said God, I meant God's master plan, Lord Monckton.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:14:03.647]  Looking back on this, how carbon is stored, you know, from all of the alluvial things that have been deposited by the plants and animals and life that's died producing crude oil.
[02:14:04.047 --> 02:14:13.934]  We then discover it 150 years ago, pump it up, put it out right at a time that we're starved for this critical, you know, one-fourth of the life cycle on the planet in the carbon cycle.
[02:14:14.254 --> 02:14:16.816]  Water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, oxygen.
[02:14:17.236 --> 02:14:20.398]  And then now we're terraforming the planet back to a better place.
[02:14:20.438 --> 02:14:24.941]  And as you said, it's mainstream news that the Sahara is now being reclaimed by greenage.
[02:14:26.442 --> 02:14:27.303]  That's exactly it.
[02:14:28.384 --> 02:14:39.391]  Very large areas of the Sahel, which is the southern Sahara, really dry, one of the poorest places on earth because it was so dry, is now beginning, as it was 7,000 years ago, until about 7,000 years ago when the Nile dried up.
[02:14:42.233 --> 02:14:44.475]  That was one of the most luxuriant places on the planet.
[02:14:44.555 --> 02:14:45.155]  Now look at it.
[02:14:45.616 --> 02:14:54.562]  So, we're now putting back the CO2, we're therefore putting back the plants and trees in areas where they never have been before, and they're self-seeding.
[02:14:54.602 --> 02:14:56.723]  We're not actually going out into the Sahel and planting them.
[02:14:56.964 --> 02:15:04.449]  They're finding their own way there, just as they have countless, countless times before, throughout the long and ancient history of this planet.
[02:15:04.829 --> 02:15:09.032]  And what people are beginning to realize, even NASA is beginning to wake up to the fact,
[02:15:09.472 --> 02:15:26.879]  That if you go on and on and on beating this global warming drum, you're missing the most important half of the story, which is that CO2 is actually good for us, it's good for plants, it's good for all life on Earth, and we want more of it and not less of it.
[02:15:26.919 --> 02:15:31.221]  Professor Will Happer at Princeton has been making this point for a couple of decades.
[02:15:31.261 --> 02:15:37.163]  He, as you know, is the man who is advising President Trump on climate change strategy, and he is saying to him,
[02:15:37.743 --> 02:15:44.408]  You do not need to take any measures whatsoever to restrict the amount of CO2 going into the air.
[02:15:44.808 --> 02:15:51.533]  Indeed, not only do you not need to do that, you should not do that, because the extra CO2 is good for everyone.
[02:15:51.553 --> 02:15:52.994]  Well, it's God works in mysterious ways.
[02:15:53.014 --> 02:15:53.835]  Stay there, Lord Monkton.
[02:15:53.855 --> 02:15:59.239]  I mean, the Earth is starving for CO2, then we discover giant underground sources and terraform.
[02:16:08.925 --> 02:16:12.018]  And we're not standing for what we're doing to him!
[02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:23.733]  How you doing?
[02:16:24.113 --> 02:16:27.015]  Was there ever a chance that you were going to get a fair trial?
[02:16:27.355 --> 02:16:29.336]  Well, it's not... A fair trial would be a jury.
[02:16:30.216 --> 02:16:32.117]  The reason why you have a jury is for fair justice.
[02:16:32.457 --> 02:16:32.958]  That's the reason.
[02:16:32.978 --> 02:16:33.718]  Magna Carta.
[02:16:33.758 --> 02:16:34.739]  That's English common law.
[02:16:35.339 --> 02:16:41.162]  But this is the back... Through the back door, the Attorney General, the government, have managed to get me before appointed judges.
[02:16:41.502 --> 02:16:42.783]  This judge was appointed two weeks ago.
[02:16:43.403 --> 02:16:44.484]  She was appointed two weeks ago.
[02:16:44.924 --> 02:16:49.528]  Appointed judges in order to convict me and even my barristers are just like, what?
[02:16:49.788 --> 02:16:51.870]  How can they find you guilty on taking a picture of someone walking into court?
[02:16:52.130 --> 02:16:52.970]  Are you scared?
[02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:54.271]  Of course I am, I'm terrified.
[02:16:54.291 --> 02:16:57.974]  I've got three beautiful children and I just had to kiss them goodbye for the fourth time on this case.
[02:16:58.414 --> 02:16:59.515]  All I've done is hold my iPhone.
[02:16:59.896 --> 02:17:01.497]  All I've done is hold my phone up and report.
[02:17:02.117 --> 02:17:03.737]  I've reported.
[02:17:03.797 --> 02:17:09.658]  If this was happening to a journalist in any other country, in Russia and China, our politicians would all be screaming from the rooftops about it.
[02:17:10.078 --> 02:17:10.399]  All of them.
[02:17:10.419 --> 02:17:12.739]  But instead, there's a way for Americanists to understand.
[02:17:13.059 --> 02:17:15.339]  Your rights, your freedoms will be chipped away, chipped away, chipped away.
[02:17:15.359 --> 02:17:16.620]  They'll disappear bit by bit.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:20.300]  And as they disappear, the CNNs, the BBCs, they will celebrate it.
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:25.041]  Do you think you feel, do you hear the level of support out in the rest of the UK?
[02:17:25.101 --> 02:17:29.982]  People like, you know, my friends, my parents' friends, they see you as a good guy.
[02:17:30.202 --> 02:17:31.703]  I see it in every town and city.
[02:17:31.923 --> 02:17:34.264]  If I didn't see it, I'd really get disheartened.
[02:17:34.444 --> 02:17:40.687]  Every town and city, I see that the British public, which is where, again, if you're in America, we have been scared into silence.
[02:17:40.867 --> 02:17:44.149]  Our entire population think things, but they're too scared to say them.
[02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:45.429]  Because there is no free speech.
[02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:46.790]  We live in a post-free speech era.
[02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:48.751]  There's no free speech, and now there's no freedom of the press.
[02:17:48.951 --> 02:17:51.774]  And would you say that you are, you know, ahead of America?
[02:17:51.794 --> 02:17:53.255]  Where we go, America follows.
[02:17:53.275 --> 02:17:54.557]  America will be right behind us on this.
[02:17:54.577 --> 02:17:56.279]  Oh, your freedoms are going to go in the same way.
[02:17:56.299 --> 02:17:58.941]  If the Democrats were in power now, they'd already be going.
[02:17:58.981 --> 02:18:00.963]  They're a road and a road and chip and chip and chip.
[02:18:01.264 --> 02:18:08.211]  And whilst they do it, the corporist, globalist media will celebrate it, support it, run the fake narrative, run the agenda, and they will destroy anyone's name.
[02:18:08.291 --> 02:18:16.794]  And if you had a message for Americans, what's your message as you head to court to be sentenced, maybe put in prison, what's your message for America?
[02:18:17.335 --> 02:18:17.995]  Britain has fallen.
[02:18:18.475 --> 02:18:19.415]  It's already fallen.
[02:18:19.515 --> 02:18:23.057]  Our judiciary system is corrupt, our politicians are corrupt, our media are corrupt.
[02:18:23.517 --> 02:18:28.739]  The message to America, hold on to the things you love, freedom, because it will go, and it will go like that.
[02:18:28.939 --> 02:18:32.141]  Listening to that in the background, you can hear Tommy Tommy, that chant.
[02:18:32.181 --> 02:18:34.323]  How does that make you feel when you hear that?
[02:18:34.403 --> 02:18:36.264]  I feel like, I never feel alone anyway.
[02:18:36.364 --> 02:18:36.984]  That's one thing.
[02:18:37.184 --> 02:18:41.987]  Everywhere I walk, when I walk into any pub in any town or city, I get a Heroes reception.
[02:18:42.028 --> 02:18:43.168]  I haven't bought a beer for years.
[02:18:46.972 --> 02:18:57.563]  I have been convicted, so people understand what the wording means, of causing anxiety to the Muslim paedophiles by asking them how they feel about their verdict.
[02:18:57.763 --> 02:19:01.887]  They say the law is the law, but it's just their interpretation of whatever they want the law to be.
[02:19:02.207 --> 02:19:02.888]  Whatever they want.
[02:19:02.908 --> 02:19:03.629]  Whatever they want it to be.
[02:19:03.649 --> 02:19:06.672]  That's what people need to understand and see, that we don't have a fair system.
[02:19:18.712 --> 02:19:22.215]  And in this moment, he really is part of something much bigger.
[02:19:24.658 --> 02:19:29.462]  An army of patriots, proud and loyal, wanting to stand up for a better Britain.
[02:19:30.463 --> 02:19:36.629]  But as Tommy takes his bags and hugs his mates, it's him alone that has to face the courts.
[02:19:37.170 --> 02:19:38.611]  Which way are we going in here?
[02:19:39.052 --> 02:19:43.916]  One man, standing up for our daughters, against the system and the state.
[02:20:06.283 --> 02:20:09.004]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.747 --> 02:20:23.448]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[02:20:24.028 --> 02:20:26.009]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.369 --> 02:20:29.530]  Well, it's raining folks from the UK here.
[02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:35.652]  Paul Joseph Watson comes up in the next two segments into the fourth hour today.
[02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:41.612]  Lord Christopher Monckton's our guest, and he's in D.C.
[02:20:41.632 --> 02:20:43.033]  tomorrow giving a speech at Trump Hotel.
[02:20:43.053 --> 02:20:44.354]  I wish I could go.
[02:20:44.374 --> 02:20:53.019]  I've got family stuff I've got to take care of and some things here, but I'd love to fly him down, invite him down to come out to Austin, co-host with us here in the next few days.
[02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:57.742]  But just pulling back from this, you're always a scientist.
[02:20:57.782 --> 02:21:00.084]  You were Margaret Thatcher's chief advisor on science.
[02:21:00.924 --> 02:21:02.265]  Some said her chief advisor total.
[02:21:02.285 --> 02:21:03.186]  You've been around a long time.
[02:21:03.226 --> 02:21:04.066]  You're a famous inventor.
[02:21:04.987 --> 02:21:05.988]  You're a successful businessman.
[02:21:07.148 --> 02:21:11.392]  He parachuted into climate accords in Durban, South Africa, when they were censoring you.
[02:21:11.412 --> 02:21:14.694]  You've been beaten up in Paris at climate accords.
[02:21:14.714 --> 02:21:17.797]  I mean, the left's really trying to shut you down.
[02:21:19.636 --> 02:21:24.458]  But you keep arguing with them about science, obviously climate changes, obviously things are going on.
[02:21:24.478 --> 02:21:26.298]  They want control of all human activity.
[02:21:26.658 --> 02:21:29.359]  They want to make industry evil so they can tax and control it.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:33.901]  And the world's woken up to this because China, India, nobody else will sign on to it.
[02:21:34.361 --> 02:21:36.342]  But what is the current state of their scams?
[02:21:36.722 --> 02:21:38.262]  What is the current state of their power grab?
[02:21:38.282 --> 02:21:42.364]  Because you can keep stating all these studies, you know, showing all their claims are a fraud.
[02:21:42.964 --> 02:21:50.894]  I think the world knows it's a fraud, and we should go after them for the fact that they have developed a fraud, and that they're trying to outlaw people questioning them.
[02:21:52.115 --> 02:21:58.043]  Let me pick up on this word, fraud, because that, Alex, is exactly what it has become.
[02:21:58.797 --> 02:22:14.435]  I mean, what happened when we first submitted our paper explaining this huge error right at the heart of climate science to a leading journal, I won't say which one, so as to spare its blushes and it looks as though the police are going to have to be called in to start investigating some of this.
[02:22:14.955 --> 02:22:19.681]  The first thing that it said was, we can't find anyone competent to review this paper.
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:21.701]  Well, that was nonsense.
[02:22:21.721 --> 02:22:22.542]  So we said, come off it.
[02:22:22.582 --> 02:22:25.104]  It's your job to find people competent to review the paper.
[02:22:25.124 --> 02:22:31.228]  And if not, we can supply plenty of names on both sides of this debate who would be competent to review this paper.
[02:22:31.248 --> 02:22:32.309]  So they gave up on that one.
[02:22:32.329 --> 02:22:34.351]  And then they sent it out for review.
[02:22:34.391 --> 02:22:37.313]  And after six months, they had got precisely two reviews, Alex.
[02:22:37.753 --> 02:22:38.814]  One of them said this.
[02:22:39.655 --> 02:22:42.957]  I do not like the conclusion that this paper comes to.
[02:22:43.658 --> 02:22:48.922]  Therefore, I have not read the paper and I have not read the equations justifying the conclusion.
[02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:53.152]  And that was supposed to be a scientific peer review.
[02:22:53.713 --> 02:22:56.775]  The other one said, I have not reviewed the main paper at all.
[02:22:57.155 --> 02:23:04.579]  I have read an ancillary paper with an experiment where we had demonstrated how this works by building a test rig.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.481]  And he said, oh, the experiment wasn't done right.
[02:23:07.742 --> 02:23:11.444]  Well, it was, because it was done by one of our national laboratories.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:15.506]  So we wrote to the editor and said, look, this isn't good enough.
[02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:17.369]  We want to appeal against this.
[02:23:17.409 --> 02:23:20.975]  So he said, OK, you can send the paper back to me for review.
[02:23:21.396 --> 02:23:23.199]  So we spent another few months trying to
[02:23:24.111 --> 02:23:26.934]  See if we could stiffen it up to stop this kind of thing happening.
[02:23:27.254 --> 02:23:30.137]  We sent it to him again and got no reply.
[02:23:30.197 --> 02:23:32.700]  We sent it to him another time and we got no reply.
[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:38.466]  Sure, they have that hoax that there's total 100% consensus that we're all going to die.
[02:23:38.586 --> 02:23:41.529]  AOC says the Earth's ending in 12 years.
[02:23:41.629 --> 02:23:42.550]  It's just insane.
[02:23:43.789 --> 02:23:44.950]  All of this is nonsense.
[02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:54.757]  I mean, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is, of course, a former barkeep and is therefore no expert on the climate or anything else much.
[02:23:55.578 --> 02:24:08.067]  And the new slogan, which I understand that the Republicans are adopting, is make Alexandria bartend again, because her green new deal
[02:24:08.995 --> 02:24:10.978]  is heroically absurd.
[02:24:11.338 --> 02:24:19.689]  And as you were saying earlier, Alex, this is indeed about concentrating all power over every tiny aspect of every person's life.
[02:24:20.632 --> 02:24:22.312]  In the hands of the far left.
[02:24:22.612 --> 02:24:24.273]  Where did they get this idea?
[02:24:24.593 --> 02:24:34.015]  They got it from a particular division of the European far left called the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, the Nazi Party.
[02:24:34.615 --> 02:24:43.537]  If you ever read Mein Kampf, which is a deeply unpleasant experience... Oh, that's why he loved IBM, because Hollerith and the machines could track every human activity.
[02:24:43.577 --> 02:24:44.537]  The Nazis wanted to do that.
[02:24:45.425 --> 02:24:45.846]  All of that.
[02:24:45.886 --> 02:24:50.751]  But the other thing that they wanted to do was to invent an environmental policy.
[02:24:50.791 --> 02:24:51.592]  They were the first.
[02:24:51.833 --> 02:24:54.976]  And they didn't want to do it because the environment was at risk.
[02:24:55.096 --> 02:24:57.259]  After all, it's been around for four and a half billion years.
[02:24:57.279 --> 02:25:01.644]  Hitler said to control populations, we've got to control the environment.
[02:25:01.744 --> 02:25:05.869]  And Hitler actually says so explicitly in Mein Kampf.
[02:25:06.576 --> 02:25:08.682]  The idea was then picked up by the Russians.
[02:25:09.404 --> 02:25:15.078]  They then began, particularly when the Berlin Wall came down, and they still wanted to influence the West.
[02:25:15.909 --> 02:25:30.019]  They began funding the anti-fracking groups in Britain, for instance, because Putin is trying to sell gas from Siberia, which is his only major source of income from overseas.
[02:25:30.439 --> 02:25:32.501]  That's what Putin is making his fortune out of.
[02:25:32.981 --> 02:25:43.789]  And they want to be able to go on selling gas to the European Union, whose commissars they control, effectively, so that the commissars make sure that most countries in the European Union are obliged...
[02:25:44.369 --> 02:25:45.610]  Lord Monkton, we're out of time.
[02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:48.732]  I want to invite you back on for a full hour soon, just briefly.
[02:25:49.193 --> 02:25:53.896]  You've got to come on again about the geopolitics, about Trump, about where all this is going.
[02:25:54.157 --> 02:25:59.741]  How would you, in 60 seconds, break down the makeup of what's happening in the world right now?
[02:26:00.101 --> 02:26:03.184]  A revolution by populists and nationalists against globalists?
[02:26:04.346 --> 02:26:06.007]  Well that's exactly what's happened with Trump.
[02:26:06.087 --> 02:26:13.072]  It's now happened here in the UK today, because Boris Johnson has, thank goodness, become our Prime Minister at last.
[02:26:13.112 --> 02:26:14.974]  He nearly did three years ago, we wish he had.
[02:26:15.334 --> 02:26:17.715]  He is now our Prime Minister, thank heavens.
[02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:24.941]  And he is going to fight the globalists in the EU, just as Mr Trump is fighting the globalists at the EU.
[02:26:24.961 --> 02:26:26.462]  So he's going to do what May didn't do?
[02:26:26.482 --> 02:26:28.063]  I'm sorry?
[02:26:28.303 --> 02:26:29.344]  He's going to do what May didn't do.
[02:26:30.023 --> 02:26:33.757]  He's very determined to make sure that we leave the European Union.
[02:26:34.078 --> 02:26:36.066]  Parliament is very determined to stop him.
[02:26:36.627 --> 02:26:47.430]  But the people voted for Brexit, and he is going to do his level best to make sure that what the people voted for, they actually get, whether Parliament likes it or not.
[02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:57.132]  And if Parliament stands in his way, this is going to be a metaphor for the rest of the world fighting this ghastly, socialist, communist, totalitarian blob.
[02:26:57.452 --> 02:26:59.232]  We're going to go and get them.
[02:26:59.252 --> 02:27:05.254]  We're going to defeat them, and we are going to leave the EU, and other countries will very swiftly follow.
[02:27:06.365 --> 02:27:06.765]  Beautiful.
[02:27:06.785 --> 02:27:10.086]  Well, please come back on as soon as you can and Godspeed with the speech tomorrow.
[02:27:10.386 --> 02:27:12.447]  The invitation to fly to Austin is open.
[02:27:12.487 --> 02:27:14.048]  Thank you, Lord Christopher Monckton.
[02:27:14.368 --> 02:27:16.508]  Again, the best website is whatsupwiththat.com.
[02:27:16.548 --> 02:27:16.889]  Thank you.
[02:27:17.849 --> 02:27:18.229]  Bless you.
[02:27:19.149 --> 02:27:22.871]  All right, I forgot to plug last hour, ladies and gentlemen, and if we don't plug, we're not going to be here.
[02:27:24.191 --> 02:27:31.654]  We have a new giant special going, 50% off DNA Force Plus, and we also have 50% off
[02:27:33.561 --> 02:27:39.645]  The great Tri-Iodine X3 and the great X2 that just is about to come back into stock.
[02:27:39.685 --> 02:27:43.267]  So, it doesn't get here until next week, but I'm still taking orders and saying it's there.
[02:27:43.287 --> 02:27:44.648]  It ended up selling out.
[02:27:45.148 --> 02:27:48.670]  And we've got a lot of other specials as well, but take advantage of that.
[02:27:48.710 --> 02:28:00.257]  And all InfoWars Life storable foods that are just MyPatriotSupply private labeled so that we're able to get around some of the rules they have with distributors to give you even more off than anybody else.
[02:28:00.797 --> 02:28:03.139]  High quality storable foods, highest quality in the last 25 years.
[02:28:04.468 --> 02:28:06.110]  That's all 50% off as well.
[02:28:07.652 --> 02:28:12.558]  And we have back in stock the vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter.
[02:28:13.499 --> 02:28:14.120]  No fillers.
[02:28:15.121 --> 02:28:15.762]  No additives.
[02:28:16.182 --> 02:28:16.983]  They're like coffee.
[02:28:17.003 --> 02:28:17.744]  They're so pure.
[02:28:17.784 --> 02:28:18.385]  They're so big.
[02:28:19.887 --> 02:28:21.469]  At half the price you get at Whole Foods.
[02:28:22.049 --> 02:28:23.832]  These are amazing protein bars.
[02:28:25.598 --> 02:28:29.881]  At Infowarslife.com, they are back in stock, the two different types of those.
[02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:36.046]  And when you just buy the coffee, buy the toothpaste, buy the fish oil, buy the things you need already, it funds this operation to face the globalists.
[02:28:36.106 --> 02:28:38.308]  And I salute you all, and thank you for that.
[02:28:38.488 --> 02:28:40.729]  I've got a lot of big stuff cooking.
[02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:44.692]  And that's why we've got some projects that need money to fund.
[02:28:45.193 --> 02:28:46.434]  You've seen what we've done to the globalists.
[02:28:47.094 --> 02:28:48.775]  Bet on Infowars again, my friends.
[02:28:49.316 --> 02:28:51.798]  You'll see stuff you can't even imagine.
[02:28:52.458 --> 02:28:54.880]  We can't tell you about it until it's history, though.
[02:28:57.367 --> 02:28:58.928]  Execute operations.
[02:29:04.851 --> 02:29:07.652]  This is such a crazy story that I'm gonna tell it.
[02:29:08.152 --> 02:29:11.494]  I called Tim Fregier into my office yesterday.
[02:29:11.754 --> 02:29:13.735]  He's our operations manager, a good friend of mine.
[02:29:15.055 --> 02:29:17.777]  And I said, do you remember
[02:29:20.103 --> 02:29:26.770]  Last week, I said we're going to sell out of the new Betsy Ross American flag.
[02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:29.432]  These colors don't run America's back shirts, which we did sell out of.
[02:29:29.453 --> 02:29:30.393]  Thanks for the support, folks.
[02:29:30.413 --> 02:29:31.334]  Look at the price we sell them.
[02:29:31.354 --> 02:29:33.897]  We got to sell a ton of them to fund the operation, but we did sell 4,000.
[02:29:34.357 --> 02:29:35.899]  And I said, I told folks it's a popper.
[02:29:35.919 --> 02:29:36.680]  We have a new variant.
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:40.824]  And I said, I want the new variant to be an American flag, a Betsy Ross, but also another just
[02:29:41.044 --> 02:29:45.927]  Classic American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[02:29:46.127 --> 02:29:48.889]  And on the back, America's back, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:49.029 --> 02:29:54.672]  Last night, I'm on InfoWars.com, and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[02:29:54.992 --> 02:29:58.354]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned.
[02:29:58.394 --> 02:30:01.156]  Of course, it's a common sense shirt, but what's better than just an American flag?
[02:30:01.176 --> 02:30:03.457]  How about a, don't tread on me, under the flag?
[02:30:03.657 --> 02:30:04.738]  Say, don't tread on the American flag.
[02:30:04.838 --> 02:30:05.659]  It's a perfect combo.
[02:30:05.699 --> 02:30:06.680]  So great minds think alike.
[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:10.304]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same, similar design.
[02:30:10.444 --> 02:30:11.946]  And so that's the new limited edition.
[02:30:11.986 --> 02:30:12.367]  We're printing 4,000.
[02:30:13.107 --> 02:30:17.392]  By the way, just yesterday, the 4,000 shirts of the Betsy Ross flag arrived.
[02:30:17.412 --> 02:30:18.393]  The ones that are already sold out.
[02:30:18.413 --> 02:30:19.374]  Those are now shipping today.
[02:30:19.875 --> 02:30:21.176]  Everyone wants this new limited edition.
[02:30:21.397 --> 02:30:28.764]  It is the Don't Tread on Me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[02:30:28.844 --> 02:30:35.511]  And I'm told by folks that know Chris Pratt, I think it's pretty obvious he's a Christian and is criticized for that, that the guy is a patriot.
[02:30:35.731 --> 02:30:36.312]  That's exciting.
[02:30:36.332 --> 02:30:37.713]  So this is inspired by the shirt he's wearing.
[02:30:37.793 --> 02:30:40.256]  But it reminded me that I was already having the shirt designed.
[02:30:41.497 --> 02:30:43.119]  Tim's like, wow, that's crazy.
[02:30:43.539 --> 02:30:44.660]  But no, it's really not crazy.
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:45.381]  Think about it.
[02:30:45.521 --> 02:30:48.724]  Don't tread on me, because they're treading on the American flag, and then the snake's with it.
[02:30:48.864 --> 02:30:49.945]  And it just really works well.
[02:30:50.045 --> 02:30:57.612]  We did a little bit better design, I think, but it's a battle-tattered flag, like the one that flew over Fort Sumter, that's in the Star Spangled Banner song, or National Anthem.
[02:30:57.692 --> 02:31:01.855]  And again, on the back, it says, America's Back, Infowars.com.
[02:31:01.996 --> 02:31:04.578]  So I am very, very proud of that new shirt.
[02:31:04.718 --> 02:31:09.742]  America's Back, Infowars.com, 4,000 of these babies.
[02:31:09.982 --> 02:31:10.422]  And that's it.
[02:31:10.522 --> 02:31:11.863]  I mean, I'm in there with the graphics folks.
[02:31:11.983 --> 02:31:14.345]  I want an American flag, and I want the Betsy Ross ones.
[02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:16.586]  You know, two different shirts, four different variants, just like the last shirt.
[02:31:16.707 --> 02:31:17.887]  And they go, how do you want the steak?
[02:31:17.927 --> 02:31:19.649]  And I go, I don't know, kind of fade it into it?
[02:31:20.069 --> 02:31:29.896]  But, you know, where you see it, and then Chris Pratt is wearing one just like it, and then he gets in trouble, and the left says it's racist, and they're going to unfollow him, and Hollywood's not sure now.
[02:31:29.996 --> 02:31:32.738]  You know, you wore an American flag, it's a white supremacist symbol.
[02:31:32.878 --> 02:31:34.258]  They said Betsy Ross was one!
[02:31:34.278 --> 02:31:35.399]  She was an abolitionist!
[02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:41.960]  The average leftist is so dumb, they don't know abolitionists were the Christian movement out of England and the United States that banned slavery worldwide.
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:47.041]  England went to war with at least 11 countries to ban it and lost over 100,000 sailors and marines.
[02:31:48.562 --> 02:31:55.383]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at InfoWarsTore.com being printed in the USA right now.
[02:31:55.483 --> 02:31:56.483]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:33:21.866 --> 02:33:26.889]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.911 --> 02:33:37.136]  Well, we had Jessica Yanivy, or however you say it, on earlier.
[02:33:37.156 --> 02:33:40.598]  She's gonna be back on The War Room today.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:43.501]  And that should be interesting.
[02:33:43.941 --> 02:33:44.862]  We got to do a lot of it.
[02:33:44.902 --> 02:33:46.163]  We kind of dodged the question.
[02:33:46.303 --> 02:33:47.243]  She dodged the question.
[02:33:48.024 --> 02:33:53.167]  About why are you trying to organize 12-year-olds to meet topless at a pool, but parents shouldn't be there?
[02:33:53.827 --> 02:33:54.647]  Sounds like pedophilia.
[02:33:54.667 --> 02:33:55.508]  I mean, I brought that up.
[02:33:56.448 --> 02:33:58.269]  She, he dodged it.
[02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:01.231]  But we'll see on the War Room today coming up.
[02:34:01.691 --> 02:34:11.077]  But for the next hour and 27 minutes or so, Paul Joseph Watson, who identifies as a Northern England Sheffield patriot,
[02:34:12.768 --> 02:34:19.369]  Is going to be hosting the broadcast and I appreciate that because I've got a lot of fish in the grease.
[02:34:20.529 --> 02:34:22.470]  I got a lot of irons in the fire.
[02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:27.731]  I got a lot of stuff going on that I can't tell you about until it's done.
[02:34:27.771 --> 02:34:33.932]  But for everything you see in fours do that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:34:35.332 --> 02:34:39.113]  The tip of the spear and you're funding of our operation at the tip of the spear.
[02:34:39.153 --> 02:34:41.133]  So I just want to briefly tell you about this because
[02:34:42.865 --> 02:34:46.348]  You know, I put this write-up together just a few days ago because I want to rebrand things.
[02:34:46.828 --> 02:34:51.592]  Not just say, buy our products because, you know, you need to support us.
[02:34:51.932 --> 02:34:57.996]  Buy our products because when we didn't have iodine in our food, the IQs dropped 15 points.
[02:34:59.817 --> 02:35:01.939]  The government added it for a while, they went up 15 points.
[02:35:01.979 --> 02:35:03.240]  Now they've taken it out, and guess what?
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:04.481]  They've gone down even more than that.
[02:35:06.095 --> 02:35:08.359]  Here are all the mainstream news articles breaking it down.
[02:35:08.399 --> 02:35:09.100]  So we have X3.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:13.326]  That's the deep-earth crystal, pure iodine, and then two other types to help it absorb.
[02:35:13.627 --> 02:35:14.508]  And we have the X2.
[02:35:14.809 --> 02:35:19.376]  It's 50% off, even though it's the bestseller, because I want you to get it.
[02:35:19.396 --> 02:35:20.918]  And it's not just a gimmick.
[02:35:21.579 --> 02:35:23.340]  It's like, hey, Trump's going to get elected.
[02:35:23.721 --> 02:35:25.162]  Nationalists are going to get elected everywhere.
[02:35:25.502 --> 02:35:27.003]  We're going to take on the New World Order.
[02:35:27.423 --> 02:35:28.584]  We're going to turn the tide.
[02:35:29.024 --> 02:35:37.130]  Jerry Epstein's a giant, you know, child pornographer, controller, blackmailing people for Mossad and criminal elements of the CIA.
[02:35:37.610 --> 02:35:38.791]  It's all coming out.
[02:35:40.992 --> 02:35:43.994]  I told you the White House is being illegally spied on and how it was happening.
[02:35:44.014 --> 02:35:44.935]  Now it's mainstream news.
[02:35:45.195 --> 02:35:46.516]  Now the indictments are being announced.
[02:35:47.697 --> 02:35:47.857]  So.
[02:35:49.824 --> 02:35:56.770]  That's what I'm saying is, I don't tell you that iodine is a game changer, it is amazing, and that you can't find real iodine almost anywhere.
[02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:59.071]  That's not made up, that's the truth.
[02:36:00.012 --> 02:36:06.097]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, and then we get the funding to wreck the globalist future.
[02:36:06.818 --> 02:36:09.100]  We've already devastated the enemy, but they're striking back.
[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:12.402]  We need to secure a pro-human future, and we're doing it together.
[02:36:13.103 --> 02:36:16.345]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:22.176 --> 02:36:29.219]  Please, the globalists are obsessed with putting bad allergens in to block the good iodine, the fluoride, the chlorine, the bromide, the bromine.
[02:36:29.619 --> 02:36:31.239]  Please learn about X2 and X3.
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:33.080]  They're both apples and oranges.
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:34.441]  Just look at it.
[02:36:34.461 --> 02:36:35.681]  Learn about it.
[02:36:36.201 --> 02:36:37.002]  Some other big specials.
[02:36:37.022 --> 02:36:37.642]  50% off.
[02:36:37.702 --> 02:36:38.962]  It's been sold out for a while.
[02:36:39.002 --> 02:36:39.803]  Big shipment came in.
[02:36:40.283 --> 02:36:41.183]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:36:41.623 --> 02:36:43.004]  The Rolls-Royce.
[02:36:43.524 --> 02:36:50.467]  The Ferrari of telomere protection and of mitochondrial protection and of just overall kick-ass-edness.
[02:36:51.354 --> 02:36:52.775]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:36:53.555 --> 02:36:54.555]  It's the house you built.
[02:36:55.255 --> 02:36:56.416]  It's the house under attack.
[02:36:56.896 --> 02:36:59.517]  It's the house that must be secured for the next attack.
[02:37:00.377 --> 02:37:05.839]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over for the next hour and 23 minutes and 7 seconds.
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:08.400]  Thanks Alex.
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:17.323]  Yeah, I'm continuing to talk about Jessica Yaniv, obviously you just had on the show earlier, because lo and behold, some new information.
[02:37:17.343 --> 02:37:19.344]  The Succulent Goblin, as he's known?
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:21.480]  Well, she, Alex.
[02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:33.743]  Let's be careful because she, let's respect those pronouns because these people are in control of the world now, she has already got two people banned on Twitter for not referring to her as a she.
[02:37:33.843 --> 02:37:37.964]  So that's what I'm going to do because again, this is Clown World and these people run it now.
[02:37:38.764 --> 02:37:44.646]  New information has come out about alleged chat conversations on Facebook between
[02:37:45.504 --> 02:37:55.732]  Jessica Yaniv and a then 14-year-old girl who was about to turn 15, sexually suggestive conversations on Facebook.
[02:37:55.792 --> 02:37:59.035]  Imagine my shock, because we didn't see this coming all along, did we?
[02:37:59.495 --> 02:38:13.426]  And just as she denied being behind those tweets during the interview, claiming they were fake, she is also claiming that this chat log is fake, despite the post-millennial who came out with this story
[02:38:14.418 --> 02:38:15.959]  Asserting that it's completely true.
[02:38:16.359 --> 02:38:25.464]  Now, if they were going to create a bunch of fake posts, which basically characterize someone as a paedophile, that's going to be a gimme in terms of a lawsuit.
[02:38:25.524 --> 02:38:28.206]  So I don't know why they would want to create fake posts.
[02:38:28.746 --> 02:38:31.288]  So I'm going to go through that here in the next segment.
[02:38:31.308 --> 02:38:35.010]  But again, just to remind people of what this controversy is all about.
[02:38:35.982 --> 02:38:37.883]  Headline up at summit.news.
[02:38:37.943 --> 02:38:41.865]  Trans activist organises topless swimming session for girls as young as 12.
[02:38:42.485 --> 02:38:44.286]  Parents not allowed to be present.
[02:38:45.246 --> 02:38:51.569]  This individual is either one of the biggest predators on the internet or is one of the best trolls on the internet.
[02:38:52.188 --> 02:39:12.240]  Because the history of this controversy stems, of course, from she, Jessica Yaniv, filing 15 complaints in British Columbia, Canada, 15 Human Rights Tribunal complaints against female beauticians for their refusal to wax her male genitalia.
[02:39:13.061 --> 02:39:15.082]  And it even prompted the British comedian
[02:39:16.067 --> 02:39:21.414]  I'm free speech advocate Ricky Gervais to wade into the debate yesterday when he tweeted this.
[02:39:22.075 --> 02:39:30.966]  How did we get to the point where women are having to fight for the right to choose whether they wax some big old hairy COCK and balls or not?
[02:39:31.186 --> 02:39:33.830]  Is it not a human right to have your meat and two veg polished?
[02:39:34.474 --> 02:39:36.236]  Because that's literally what's happening.
[02:39:36.676 --> 02:39:46.405]  These beauticians are now being investigated for their refusal to perform a wax on the male genitalia of this self-professed female.
[02:39:46.425 --> 02:39:57.775]  But Paul, that's like the National Health Service where it said a 6'3 bearded man came in and demanded his cervix be pap smeared and the nurse said you have male genitals and she got in trouble.
[02:40:00.197 --> 02:40:02.778]  Oh yeah, and of course we're paying for all that as well.
[02:40:02.898 --> 02:40:04.819]  Oh, but it's conservatives that are harassing women.
[02:40:04.859 --> 02:40:08.741]  If we spread our legs a little on a subway, we're a rapist.
[02:40:09.201 --> 02:40:18.125]  But if a big ol' fat dude comes in and tells some poor woman to give him a pap smear... Again, we don't know anatomy, folks.
[02:40:18.206 --> 02:40:19.486]  A man doesn't have a cervix.
[02:40:19.586 --> 02:40:22.447]  That's the open between the vagina and the uterus.
[02:40:25.129 --> 02:40:26.229]  Where is this going, Paul?
[02:40:26.269 --> 02:40:27.550]  It's all pedophilic, we know that.
[02:40:29.264 --> 02:40:32.105]  Well, these people are now in charge of public discourse.
[02:40:32.125 --> 02:40:33.166]  This is where it's going.
[02:40:33.686 --> 02:40:35.347]  And this is the effect of it.
[02:40:35.367 --> 02:40:43.231]  You see here with the manspreading chair, she actually designed another chair that encouraged women to do what she's complaining that the men are doing.
[02:40:43.671 --> 02:40:52.536]  Of course, we don't have a conversation about bag spreading, where women place their bags on seats on public transport, which I would argue happens way more than manspreading.
[02:40:53.076 --> 02:41:03.518]  She was given an award and praised for her social justice activism for creating this hideous-looking chair, which is absolutely abominable.
[02:41:03.538 --> 02:41:07.099]  There you see the bag-spreading controversy on Twitter.
[02:41:07.119 --> 02:41:08.139]  That's not being addressed.
[02:41:08.719 --> 02:41:17.181]  But again, going back to Jessica Yaniv, taking photos of herself in female locker rooms and then the comments below are
[02:41:18.129 --> 02:41:25.457]  Quote, if there's like 30 girls in change rooms, how many of them would you say are out there changing freely with their vaginas and boobs out?
[02:41:26.218 --> 02:41:31.123]  She denies making those comments, despite the fact there are literally dozens of them that are very similar.
[02:41:32.145 --> 02:41:36.930]  Dozens of tweets directed at children asking, how old are you?
[02:41:37.371 --> 02:41:46.441]  And these have been circulating for a while, before this even came out over the weekend with the beauticians being investigated by the Human Rights Tribunal.
[02:41:46.901 --> 02:41:48.884]  So this has all been circulating for a while.
[02:41:49.644 --> 02:41:53.469]  Because you had Lindsay Shepard, the free speech activist,
[02:41:54.258 --> 02:42:03.563]  Banned on Twitter a few days ago after Yaniv basically started body shaming her and talking about intimate health problems.
[02:42:03.583 --> 02:42:06.484]  You're going to talk about that when you come back, Paul, but let me ask you this question.
[02:42:06.944 --> 02:42:14.528]  Why do you think this individual is coming on my show and on The War Room and says that they're a listener?
[02:42:15.068 --> 02:42:16.529]  I think this is some damage control.
[02:42:18.357 --> 02:42:28.304]  It's either damage control or it's the biggest troll you've ever seen, Alex, because obviously, Jessica and Eve was on an Irish radio show earlier today and apparently hung up when she was challenged.
[02:42:28.864 --> 02:42:33.787]  The fact that she would agree to go on your show raises a lot of alarm bells in my mind.
[02:42:34.188 --> 02:42:41.252]  But again, I'm going to get into this new angle on it after the break, which makes it even more disturbing from the angle of child grooming.
[02:42:41.292 --> 02:42:42.353]  And we're going to get into that.
[02:42:42.373 --> 02:42:42.793]  All right.
[02:42:42.833 --> 02:42:45.635]  And you're welcome to come on the war room when he joins us.
[02:42:46.376 --> 02:42:47.797]  I mean, she joins us.
[02:42:48.917 --> 02:42:50.137]  Do you want to bow to Jessica?
[02:42:50.157 --> 02:42:52.058]  Paul?
[02:42:52.118 --> 02:42:52.778]  Yeah, let's do it.
[02:42:54.178 --> 02:42:54.378]  Sir.
[02:42:55.398 --> 02:42:56.499]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:56.779 --> 02:42:57.859]  InfoWars.com.
[02:42:57.919 --> 02:42:59.839]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:43:09.301 --> 02:43:15.743]  As usual, it seems like people are finally catching up to what InfoWars was breaking first.
[02:43:15.803 --> 02:43:16.663]  We know what's happening.
[02:43:19.975 --> 02:43:23.798]  I was just worried that people weren't really aware of how bad it is and what's really going on.
[02:43:23.818 --> 02:43:25.939]  InfoWars has been on the front front of that fight.
[02:43:26.279 --> 02:43:29.061]  I've been on the front front of that fight, and we gotta see more.
[02:43:29.241 --> 02:43:29.982]  You know, I say this.
[02:43:30.042 --> 02:43:31.103]  I'm gonna say this about InfoWars.
[02:43:31.623 --> 02:43:33.384]  Everybody can say whatever they want.
[02:43:33.804 --> 02:43:35.686]  Alex Jones is the man, in my opinion.
[02:43:35.826 --> 02:43:37.167]  I mean, whatever you people want to say.
[02:43:37.187 --> 02:43:38.508]  I've been a fan of InfoWars.
[02:43:38.648 --> 02:43:39.148]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:39.388 --> 02:43:40.269]  Free Alex Jones!
[02:43:40.729 --> 02:43:43.571]  Alex Jones needs to be back on social media where he belongs.
[02:44:10.589 --> 02:44:11.289]  Real fascists.
[02:44:11.309 --> 02:44:12.590]  We've got to make them kick us off.
[02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:17.491]  And then it just, it would just, all that would do is be underlying what they're doing to us.
[02:44:17.731 --> 02:44:25.774]  And I really hope that in the future we can get him and all of the other people that have been treated so terribly by big tech.
[02:44:26.174 --> 02:44:31.675]  Oh, we can take him out because he's sort of the symbol of, you know, the most extreme voice out there, you know.
[02:44:31.695 --> 02:44:36.177]  And so I think to him, they targeted him and used him as an example.
[02:44:36.197 --> 02:44:39.098]  A modern-day deep person, basically, it's almost like a death sentence.
[02:44:39.118 --> 02:44:40.218]  You can't get your voice out there.
[02:44:40.638 --> 02:44:43.499]  But if they come after him, they can come after anyone.
[02:44:43.519 --> 02:44:45.819]  So he should have his platform just like anybody else does.
[02:44:46.219 --> 02:44:51.880]  InfoWars has given so many young people a platform in the beginning to get their voice out there.
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:59.542]  Luckily, Alex's and your guys' audience is so big and so loyal that they're able to follow him to, you know, his personal website or the show's website.
[02:44:59.902 --> 02:45:01.582]  But other people don't have that luxury, you know?
[02:45:01.622 --> 02:45:05.343]  If you're a smaller creator and you get de-platformed early on, no one will even know you exist.
[02:45:05.723 --> 02:45:07.504]  So I got to give a shout out to InfoWars.
[02:45:07.604 --> 02:45:08.664]  I don't care what nobody else say.
[02:45:08.744 --> 02:45:10.065]  I met Alex Jones personally.
[02:45:10.385 --> 02:45:11.705]  I buy the supplements and everything.
[02:45:11.745 --> 02:45:14.346]  So I just want to give a shout out to y'all, man.
[02:45:14.366 --> 02:45:15.267]  You don't get enough credit.
[02:45:15.787 --> 02:45:16.767]  He's a freedom fighter.
[02:45:16.787 --> 02:45:18.768]  He should be here today at the White House.
[02:45:18.828 --> 02:45:19.529]  I love you, Alex.
[02:45:19.969 --> 02:45:24.811]  Everybody knows Ground Zero, Patient Zero is InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[02:45:24.951 --> 02:45:25.531]  Everybody knows that.
[02:45:32.619 --> 02:45:41.123]  A classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any info warrior serious about their oral health.
[02:45:41.223 --> 02:45:45.426]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[02:45:45.586 --> 02:45:49.408]  Fueled by the good halogen iodine and high quality nano silver.
[02:45:49.628 --> 02:45:54.370]  We've taken the fluoride out and replaced it with powerful ingredients to help boost your smile.
[02:45:54.570 --> 02:45:56.571]  Don't miss out on one of our best products.
[02:45:56.751 --> 02:46:01.554]  Power up your morning routine with Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at the InfoWars store.
[02:46:04.699 --> 02:46:08.484]  The globalists hate free speech, and they hate empowering the people.
[02:46:08.865 --> 02:46:19.419]  The entire dying dinosaur corporate media, CNN, MSNBC, bombard the public with anti-American, anti-family, anti-God, anti-gun messages.
[02:46:19.639 --> 02:46:20.340]  People are sick of it.
[02:46:21.221 --> 02:46:23.804]  Well, Subscribestar.com's exploded.
[02:46:24.224 --> 02:46:27.447]  We have our own account at Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:46:28.148 --> 02:46:41.359]  And six days a week, Monday through Friday, then on Sundays, under the Sunday show, I'm gonna take questions off Subscribestar, where you private message me, and I'm gonna answer those questions on air, starting today.
[02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:44.501]  So, InfoWars.com is a great place to visit.
[02:46:44.802 --> 02:46:51.826]  Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones is the place to ask direct questions and I will answer them on air.
[02:46:52.066 --> 02:46:56.188]  So be sure and join me during the weekday show to get your questions answered.
[02:47:05.673 --> 02:47:08.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:20.502]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[02:47:20.562 --> 02:47:26.325]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.886 --> 02:47:30.708]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:47:32.089 --> 02:47:36.832]  And we are live talking about Jessica Yaniv, who was on the show earlier.
[02:47:36.852 --> 02:47:46.819]  You've got to commend her for coming on the show and having, pun intended, the balls to speak up and defend her trans activism.
[02:47:47.786 --> 02:47:59.672]  The latest example of which involves organising a swimming session for girls as young as 12 at which it specifically says their parents and guardians are not allowed to be present.
[02:48:00.352 --> 02:48:11.277]  A trans activist who gained notoriety for attempting to force beauticians to wax their balls and penis is now arranging a swimming session for girls as young as 12 where parents will not be allowed to be present.
[02:48:11.998 --> 02:48:12.718]  This is happening
[02:48:13.903 --> 02:48:15.004]  Or it was going to happen.
[02:48:15.024 --> 02:48:19.728]  I think the initial one was cancelled and then she was trying to organise another one.
[02:48:20.248 --> 02:48:30.456]  At the Al Anderson Memorial Pool in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, the promotional material for the event states parents and or caregivers are not permitted in the event.
[02:48:31.036 --> 02:48:39.763]  Whether that's going to go forward or not remains to be seen, but this is Clown World and Canada is the epicentre of Clown World, so nothing surprises me at this point.
[02:48:40.646 --> 02:48:43.748]  It takes a lot to shock me these days, but my word.
[02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:53.375]  So, the latest development is this story up on the postmillennial.com website.
[02:48:54.016 --> 02:48:54.756]  Exclusive.
[02:48:54.957 --> 02:48:56.558]  This came out literally an hour ago.
[02:48:56.578 --> 02:49:01.101]  15-year-old alleged victim of Jessica Yaniv speaks out.
[02:49:01.201 --> 02:49:03.383]  Well, who didn't see this coming?
[02:49:03.823 --> 02:49:07.846]  Now, it's important to state from the outset that Jessica Yaniv
[02:49:08.536 --> 02:49:15.259]  Denies this story and denies that she was behind the conversations mentioned in this article.
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:23.142]  Just as she denied that she was behind the tweets when Alex was interviewing her earlier.
[02:49:24.223 --> 02:49:25.983]  Very easy get-out clause that, isn't it?
[02:49:26.604 --> 02:49:32.206]  So as a young woman has come forward with serious allegations of abuse against Jonathan, Jessica, Yaniv,
[02:49:32.924 --> 02:49:43.948]  Yaniv, a male-to-female transgender, has recently risen to infamy for the Human Rights Tribunal suits she has taken out against 16 estheticians for declining to perform waxing services on her male genitals.
[02:49:44.568 --> 02:49:55.572]  We talked about that earlier, but now 20-year-old Jessica Rumpel of Sammanish, Washington State, has disclosed details to the Postmillennial of her encounters with Jessica Yaniv.
[02:49:55.892 --> 02:49:58.713]  Guess what her encounters were with Jessica Yaniv?
[02:49:59.341 --> 02:50:04.464]  Well, Rumpel was just 14 years old at the time of the interactions, just about to turn 15.
[02:50:04.504 --> 02:50:13.050]  And if you pull up this article, you can see the actual conversations, again, denied by Jessica Yeniv.
[02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:15.712]  She is claiming that these are fake messages.
[02:50:16.192 --> 02:50:19.074]  The Postmillennial asserts that they're very much real.
[02:50:19.374 --> 02:50:24.377]  They come from the official trusted nerd Facebook account of Jessica Yeniv.
[02:50:24.397 --> 02:50:25.258]  And I doubt they would
[02:50:26.659 --> 02:50:35.226]  So Blasé just published obviously fake messages and obviously put them at risk of a winnable, eminently winnable lawsuit for Jessica Yaniv.
[02:50:35.626 --> 02:50:41.611]  So as you see up on screen now, Jessica Yaniv says, lol how old are you again?
[02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:45.314]  The respondent, Jessica Rumpel, responds 14.
[02:50:46.054 --> 02:50:49.137]  Yaniv says, I don't know if I should lol.
[02:50:49.958 --> 02:50:51.379]  Almost 15, I don't know.
[02:50:51.819 --> 02:50:52.940]  And it goes on from there.
[02:50:54.736 --> 02:51:01.759]  So this 14 year old, 14 at the time, said, at first I thought, you know, this guy seems to have some kind of mental issues of some sort.
[02:51:02.019 --> 02:51:02.739]  Really, do you think?
[02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:06.461]  She says, I didn't think he was a predator at first.
[02:51:07.121 --> 02:51:07.501]  Really?
[02:51:07.602 --> 02:51:15.745]  Well, he opens up by asking how old a child is and continues to talk to him on Facebook in a sexually suggestive manner, as we'll see in a moment.
[02:51:16.371 --> 02:51:25.975]  Yaniv made contact with Rumpel through social media site Ask.fm, where people, including those who are anonymous, can ask questions of users and receive answers in short form.
[02:51:27.055 --> 02:51:41.120]  Rumpel states that Yaniv sent her a series of disturbing questions while anonymous, before adding her to the private messenger application Kik, K-I-K, which is known to law enforcement for its notoriously poor protection of children.
[02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:44.962]  It's basically the app of choice for paedophiles!
[02:51:45.771 --> 02:51:46.992]  Just by coincidence.
[02:51:47.672 --> 02:51:56.778]  According to Rumpel, Yaniv allegedly presented himself as a young male in his late 20s and claims that he used pictures of himself when he was younger in their initial conversation.
[02:51:57.438 --> 02:52:08.045]  And in fact, elsewhere, other people are claiming that Jessica Yaniv contacted them during this same time period and claimed to be a 17-year-old boy.
[02:52:08.925 --> 02:52:14.909]  But the article continues, Rumpel states it was sympathy that caused her to continue contact with Yaniv initially.
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:17.280]  He liked to make himself be the victim.
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:21.662]  He actually told me he had folliculitis, whatever that is, and depression.
[02:52:22.842 --> 02:52:35.085]  And you see this over and over again with people like Twitch streamers, with YouTubers who get online, invent a mental illness that they've got and ask for money and beg for attention.
[02:52:35.185 --> 02:52:39.126]  This is the new rampant narcissism fueled by social media.
[02:52:40.123 --> 02:52:46.867]  But, according to this, the allegation is that Jessica Yaniv used it basically to groom children, as we shall see.
[02:52:47.487 --> 02:52:53.291]  Pitying who she thought was an emotionally pained young man, Rumple maintained some regular contact with Yaniv.
[02:52:54.852 --> 02:52:55.312]  She said, So, Yaniv...
[02:53:10.066 --> 02:53:15.310]  Obviously has some weird fetish obsession with female sanitary products.
[02:53:15.610 --> 02:53:21.535]  The alleged victim says Yaniv always told me he uses pads and wants to go into the ladies bathroom.
[02:53:22.095 --> 02:53:25.217]  And as we saw with the tweets, that seems to be a constant obsession.
[02:53:25.237 --> 02:53:26.939]  But of course they're fake too, apparently.
[02:53:26.959 --> 02:53:33.964]  Yaniv asked me how to go into the ladies bathroom without being caught and then how to be in the bathroom if there's a lot of women or girls.
[02:53:35.063 --> 02:53:42.726]  And as we saw before, there are selfies that this Jessica Yaniv individual has took in female changing rooms.
[02:53:44.326 --> 02:53:57.571]  So the conversation continues and it's basically Jessica Yaniv asking if she, with male genitalia of course, can get changed in front of young women and girls in a female locker room.
[02:53:58.511 --> 02:54:04.393]  According to Rumpel, the alleged victim, Yaniv did not identify as transgender at any point during their interactions.
[02:54:05.541 --> 02:54:16.447]  Now, of course, if you look at the screenshots of that chat now, it shows Jessica Yaniv looking or presenting as a female because, of course, that's what happens on Facebook.
[02:54:16.547 --> 02:54:25.892]  Even though the conversation is old, several years old, in fact, I think five years old, the profile picture is still going to show up as the current profile picture.
[02:54:25.932 --> 02:54:26.893]  So that's why it does that.
[02:54:28.058 --> 02:54:43.293]  The victim continued she believed Yaniv simply had a fetish for bathrooms, pads and girls clothing as Yaniv would also begin sending rumpled worrying messages including photos of himself in girls jeans asking for comments and compliments from the then 15 year old.
[02:54:45.295 --> 02:54:50.761]  So as you can see there the Jessica Yaniv is sending pictures of herself
[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:55.441]  In what she claims are women's jeans and asking if they look okay.
[02:54:55.581 --> 02:54:58.462]  Another absolutely bizarre example of this conversation.
[02:54:59.302 --> 02:55:05.544]  Eventually, and nobody saw this coming, Yaniv's attentions turned overtly sexual.
[02:55:07.325 --> 02:55:09.946]  Yaniv said, I'm so OMG, you know.
[02:55:10.866 --> 02:55:14.447]  The respondent, a 14 year old girl, asked hungry question mark.
[02:55:15.127 --> 02:55:16.548]  Yaniv said, it rhymes with that.
[02:55:17.248 --> 02:55:20.309]  And then the 14 year old said, tawny question mark.
[02:55:21.078 --> 02:55:24.000]  Then Yaniv said, why are you always so beautiful?
[02:55:26.002 --> 02:55:33.588]  The next conversation is the 14-year-old asking, did you also ask me if I had big boobs and big ass on Anon?
[02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:37.090]  Yaniv admits the first thing, yes.
[02:55:37.991 --> 02:55:47.018]  So if that's true, and Yaniv says it isn't, but if it's true, it's Yaniv literally asking a 14-year-old if she has big boobs.
[02:55:48.252 --> 02:55:50.354]  Absolutely clown world disgusting.
[02:55:50.394 --> 02:55:53.497]  This is the person who is now in control of this discussion.
[02:55:53.537 --> 02:55:59.763]  This is the person who's already got two people banned on Twitter for daring to argue with them, as we shall see in the next segment.
[02:56:01.904 --> 02:56:04.166]  I don't even know how much of this I can read on air.
[02:56:04.187 --> 02:56:08.350]  You need called me titty queen even asked me to marry him and I was only 15.
[02:56:09.772 --> 02:56:11.773]  He said he couldn't wait until I turned 16.
[02:56:13.194 --> 02:56:14.035]  Yaniv was born in 1987.
[02:56:14.575 --> 02:56:15.556]  He's currently 32.
[02:56:16.617 --> 02:56:18.538]  So at the time of these messages, he would have been 27.
[02:56:19.879 --> 02:56:23.903]  Of course, in other conversations, he's presenting as a 17-year-old boy.
[02:56:25.504 --> 02:56:28.826]  So it goes on, I can't wait till you turn 16, said Yaniv.
[02:56:29.367 --> 02:56:33.710]  But you're not 16, and that means I can't do anything with you as much as you want that.
[02:56:34.151 --> 02:56:34.871]  Am I right?
[02:56:35.592 --> 02:56:40.696]  So again, if true, that is directly grooming a child in a sexually suggestive manner.
[02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:42.951]  That is the allegation here.
[02:56:42.971 --> 02:56:56.904]  And it says, as has been revealed from previously exposed conversations, Yaniv often directed his comments towards menstrual stuffs, even going so far as to pester Rumple to take photos of her using feminine hygiene products.
[02:56:58.405 --> 02:57:02.569]  Again, I'm just reading this before I actually read it on air to see if I can actually read it.
[02:57:03.129 --> 02:57:06.993]  There's another video there, which I didn't pull, but I've listened to it earlier.
[02:57:08.061 --> 02:57:22.870]  And it's basically Yeniv adopting this bizarre high-pitched child-like voice, what he or she called an Elmo voice, saying things such as, Elmo wants to F and Elmo loves P-U-S-S-Y.
[02:57:23.290 --> 02:57:28.414]  In the final clip, Yeniv is heard saying, I love you, your boobies go up and down, up and down, up and down.
[02:57:29.194 --> 02:57:30.835]  And I've played that and it's disturbing.
[02:57:31.616 --> 02:57:36.679]  Rumpel explains that Yeniv had an Elmo character profile on Ask.fm and used it to send her questions.
[02:57:37.774 --> 02:57:41.035]  Absolutely absurd clown level stuff.
[02:57:41.095 --> 02:57:42.495]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[02:57:42.575 --> 02:57:43.155]  I'll wrap this up.
[02:57:43.195 --> 02:57:46.136]  I'll talk about how Ricky Gervais waded into the debate too.
[02:57:46.216 --> 02:57:47.276]  So, we'll be back.
[02:57:47.356 --> 02:57:52.617]  Don't go away.
[02:57:57.978 --> 02:58:00.659]  There's one thing the establishment hates more than anything else.
[02:58:00.719 --> 02:58:01.979]  That's human interaction.
[02:58:02.967 --> 02:58:04.329]  Between the media and the people.
[02:58:04.770 --> 02:58:09.696]  The entire corporate, globalist, New World Order combine is about making you feel powerless.
[02:58:10.097 --> 02:58:16.726]  And the media telling you America sucks, God sucks, the family sucks, the Second Amendment sucks, freedom is terrible.
[02:58:17.187 --> 02:58:18.128]  It's making you feel alone.
[02:58:19.008 --> 02:58:20.069]  The truth is, you're not alone.
[02:58:20.709 --> 02:58:22.550]  Freedom worldwide is exploding.
[02:58:22.570 --> 02:58:24.091]  It doesn't matter what color your skin is.
[02:58:24.571 --> 02:58:25.751]  People want justice.
[02:58:26.312 --> 02:58:29.233]  So we have Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:58:30.094 --> 02:58:45.281]  And in the private messages to me, I'm going to start every day, six days a week when I do the regular radio TV show that reaches millions, to answer your questions, be they political, be they personal, any question goes as long as they're not a joke.
[02:58:45.761 --> 02:58:46.622]  Or maybe they are a joke.
[02:58:47.785 --> 02:58:52.688]  As long as they're serious in some way, I will answer your questions on air.
[02:58:52.928 --> 02:58:54.669]  Wolfgar, shout out to you.
[02:58:54.689 --> 02:59:02.855]  Q Master, Raymond Alameda, Retired Army, Gregory Needles, Joseph Rulo, VP Wu, and others.
[02:59:03.815 --> 02:59:06.277]  You come, you donate, you support.
[02:59:06.777 --> 02:59:11.120]  I answer your questions on air because I respect the fact that you put skin in the game.
[02:59:12.068 --> 02:59:16.071]  So, Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:59:16.551 --> 02:59:22.095]  You go right there, you ask your questions, and if you are a subscriber, I will answer them.
[02:59:22.675 --> 02:59:25.577]  A lot of other perks as well, but the system wants to keep us apart.
[02:59:25.977 --> 02:59:28.379]  They want to keep the media from being interactive with the people.
[02:59:28.799 --> 02:59:29.920]  We want to be transparent.
[02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:32.021]  We want to be absolutely clear.
[02:59:32.462 --> 02:59:33.663]  We want to empower
[02:59:34.463 --> 02:59:36.205]  We the people, because that's all of us together.
[02:59:36.545 --> 02:59:40.448]  I'll see you all with your questions daily, Monday through Friday and Sundays.
[02:59:40.969 --> 02:59:46.513]  Every day I'll answer Subscribestar questions at Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:59:46.994 --> 02:59:51.697]  I'll see you there.
[02:59:54.460 --> 03:00:00.385]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.498 --> 03:00:11.599]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:00:11.679 --> 03:00:13.900]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:18.222]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:18.262 --> 03:00:36.651]  We are back live and we're still talking about Jessica Yaniv, the transgender activist who is basically at the forefront of having 15 female beauticians investigated by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for refusing to wax her testicles.
[03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:45.055]  We went through this allegation of a Facebook conversation with a then 14-year-old girl who claimed, and these messages, if true, prove it.
[03:00:45.135 --> 03:00:47.857]  Again, it's being denied by Yaniv that the messages are true.
[03:00:48.678 --> 03:00:51.981]  But if they are, then it proves obvious child grooming.
[03:00:52.961 --> 03:00:58.346]  Of course, Yaniv was on the show earlier, denied all this, and will be on the show again, I believe, in the War Room in the next hour.
[03:00:59.508 --> 03:01:07.813]  But this really got prominent over the past few days because the British comedian Ricky Gervais, who is a free speech advocate, waded into the debate.
[03:01:08.834 --> 03:01:19.181]  And there's actually a funny tweet, which I tweeted earlier, which was a Daily Caller article headlined, Ricky Gervais doesn't think women should be forced to wax testicles.
[03:01:19.641 --> 03:01:26.986]  And then one of the responses below that tweet was from somebody who said, the moment that Ricky Gervais became alt-right.
[03:01:28.095 --> 03:01:34.496]  That's right, because if you don't think women should be forced to wax men's testicles, that means you're a Nazi now.
[03:01:34.516 --> 03:01:38.337]  That's how much the Overton window has shifted in clown world.
[03:01:39.458 --> 03:01:45.719]  News Busters reports Ricky Gervais called transphobe for defending women refusing to wax trans woman's penis.
[03:01:47.419 --> 03:01:49.000]  Warning coarse language throughout.
[03:01:49.080 --> 03:01:51.260]  Again, I have to read this ahead of actually saying it.
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:54.521]  British comedian Ricky Gervais has been called transphobic
[03:01:55.186 --> 03:02:02.192]  Over defending women refusing to wax trans women in Canada because they're uncomfortable dealing with their clients very male genitalia.
[03:02:02.592 --> 03:02:11.259]  Gervais defended the spa workers saying that it's quote real feminism for women to choose who to wax or not but internet users aren't having it.
[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:17.745]  On Sunday Gervais weighed in on one of the most stupidly woke issues to crop up in recent memory in Canada.
[03:02:19.366 --> 03:02:22.849]  Demonstrating himself as a celebrity that isn't completely devoid of common sense
[03:02:23.570 --> 03:02:33.318]  He put out a controversial tweet which said, quote, How did we get to the point where women are having to fight for the right to choose whether they whack some big old hairy cock and balls or not?
[03:02:33.758 --> 03:02:36.360]  Is it not a human right to have your meat and two veg polished?
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:39.422]  And of course, he was immediately attacked.
[03:02:39.903 --> 03:02:49.450]  Twitter warriors clamoured against Gervais' post saying it's language like that that has threatened trans people and that it contributes to the larger hashtag war on women.
[03:02:50.391 --> 03:02:50.571]  Again,
[03:02:51.778 --> 03:03:09.535]  There are feminists, quite radical feminists, who are called transphobes, who are called TERFs, who have been excluded from public conversations, who have been banned from social media platforms for daring to suggest that men with their testicles hanging out shouldn't be allowed into female locker rooms.
[03:03:10.465 --> 03:03:19.894]  One respondent said, this was LGBTQ activist Amy Martin, quote, Ricky Gervais is a transphobe who barely disguises his bigotry as feminism.
[03:03:20.394 --> 03:03:23.837]  Real feminism includes all women, including trans women.
[03:03:25.939 --> 03:03:33.185]  So they're literally defending a man who wants to force women to shave his testicles.
[03:03:33.546 --> 03:03:35.547]  That's feminism in 2019 in clown world.
[03:03:37.907 --> 03:03:45.393]  Gervais replied, surely real feminism also covers a woman's right not to have to wax someone's knob and bollocks if they don't want to.
[03:03:47.334 --> 03:03:49.076]  And it went on from there.
[03:03:49.296 --> 03:03:57.602]  Again, we've got these new messages now that Post Millennial have posted, which seem to indicate that this is part of a child grooming operation.
[03:03:57.622 --> 03:03:59.964]  Yaniv denies those messages.
[03:04:00.445 --> 03:04:05.849]  And as Alex was saying in the last segment, could this be one giant troll?
[03:04:06.576 --> 03:04:18.591]  I mean, this is obviously coming from the mind of a very sick individual either way, but why is this individual going on radio shows that are overtly antagonistic to this whole thing as happened earlier?
[03:04:19.732 --> 03:04:22.015]  And you've also went on an Irish radio show.
[03:04:22.035 --> 03:04:23.897]  We're going to play that clip after the break.
[03:04:24.297 --> 03:04:24.638]  But again,
[03:04:25.595 --> 03:04:41.725]  Lindsey Shepard, free speech activist, was banned on Twitter, appealed the ban for basically responding to Yaniv insulting her, body shaming her for a very private personal health problem related to sexual reproduction organs.
[03:04:42.623 --> 03:04:45.926]  She responded by saying basically, well, at least I have a uterus.
[03:04:46.347 --> 03:04:46.727]  Banned.
[03:04:47.067 --> 03:04:47.808]  Gone forever.
[03:04:48.228 --> 03:04:50.551]  No, no court of appeal for Twitter, of course.
[03:04:50.931 --> 03:04:54.334]  These are the people who control public discourse.
[03:04:54.715 --> 03:04:56.156]  This is true.
[03:04:56.536 --> 03:04:57.157]  Clown world.
[03:04:57.197 --> 03:04:57.677]  We'll be back.
[03:04:57.717 --> 03:04:59.019]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:04:59.419 --> 03:04:59.940]  Don't go away.
[03:05:00.020 --> 03:05:01.321]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:03.143 --> 03:05:03.803]  Before I start...
[03:05:12.455 --> 03:05:19.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta tell ya, the InfoWars Live Protein Bars are really popular around the InfoWars office.
[03:05:19.339 --> 03:05:22.441]  I mean, people around here cannot get enough of them.
[03:05:22.621 --> 03:05:23.201]  I'm telling you.
[03:05:23.601 --> 03:05:25.182]  In fact, myself included.
[03:05:25.462 --> 03:05:29.325]  Let me just show you why the InfoWars Live Protein Bar is so popular, man.
[03:05:29.625 --> 03:05:33.007]  This thing is like a double fudge brownie.
[03:05:33.587 --> 03:05:34.107]  Look at that!
[03:05:34.407 --> 03:05:38.229]  Wrapped in peanut butter with peanuts in the middle.
[03:05:38.610 --> 03:05:42.271]  I mean, you cannot get a better tasting protein bar than this.
[03:05:42.592 --> 03:05:47.414]  And that's why people around the InfoWars office are going crazy for them and we can't even keep them on the shelves.
[03:05:47.614 --> 03:05:49.695]  But they're on sale for 40% off right now.
[03:05:49.935 --> 03:05:58.800]  So get your InfoWars Live Protein Bar 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com and you can be just like the crew around here enjoying the best protein bar on the market.
[03:06:12.953 --> 03:06:19.556]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:19.996 --> 03:06:23.858]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:25.179 --> 03:06:29.461]  I'm going to wrap this up in this segment because we've been talking about this subject literally for the best part of two hours.
[03:06:30.061 --> 03:06:38.566]  But the trans activist who is demanding that women shave her male genitalia appeared on an Irish radio show and the host made the point that
[03:06:39.201 --> 03:06:47.324]  Far from just respecting someone's pronouns, we're now being forced to share their increasingly obscure and errant beliefs.
[03:06:47.384 --> 03:06:53.887]  This is Jessica Yeniv appearing on an Irish radio show and hanging up when challenged earlier today.
[03:06:53.907 --> 03:06:54.547]  Here's the clip.
[03:06:56.192 --> 03:07:12.647]  You, if, let's say for example, I don't want to accept you as a woman, and I say, listen Jessica, I don't believe you're a woman, I believe you're a man, dressed as a woman, and I say that, you, I don't believe that you have the right to tell me to listen to you, to believe you.
[03:07:13.228 --> 03:07:15.850]  I don't believe, like for example, I'll give you an example, I don't believe in God.
[03:07:16.491 --> 03:07:17.151]  Do you believe in God?
[03:07:17.171 --> 03:07:18.813]  I'm sorry?
[03:07:18.933 --> 03:07:19.614]  Do you believe in God?
[03:07:20.615 --> 03:07:20.935]  I do.
[03:07:21.115 --> 03:07:23.216]  Okay, I don't believe in God, I'm an atheist, okay?
[03:07:23.636 --> 03:07:26.877]  Now, you believe in God, I respect the fact that you believe in God.
[03:07:27.057 --> 03:07:27.317]  Yeah.
[03:07:27.577 --> 03:07:30.819]  And I respect your point of view, and I respect your belief in God, and your faith in God.
[03:07:31.379 --> 03:07:33.660]  That doesn't mean I have to believe in God.
[03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:35.320]  Do you understand the point?
[03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:37.221]  So some people may not...
[03:07:38.001 --> 03:07:42.103]  They may respect you, and they may respect that you want to be called Jessica, but they may not believe.
[03:07:42.123 --> 03:07:43.043]  They just don't believe it.
[03:07:43.063 --> 03:07:48.825]  They say, that's fine, he wants to be called Jessica, that's fine, I'll call him Jessica, I'll respect that, but I don't believe it, and I don't buy into it.
[03:07:49.245 --> 03:07:55.948]  So what you're essentially asking these women to do is, you're asking them to do a service on you that they don't believe in.
[03:07:56.168 --> 03:07:58.569]  They don't want to handle a man's genitalia.
[03:08:00.050 --> 03:08:00.990]  Is that fair?
[03:08:01.270 --> 03:08:01.430]  Yeah.
[03:08:02.250 --> 03:08:03.731]  Not really, because, you see,
[03:08:04.304 --> 03:08:08.686]  I'm protected under the BC Human Rights Code because I'm a protected class.
[03:08:08.866 --> 03:08:10.107]  Are those women not protected?
[03:08:10.487 --> 03:08:13.569]  Are those women not protected who have a right to say no?
[03:08:14.709 --> 03:08:15.070]  They don't.
[03:08:15.330 --> 03:08:22.053]  Because essentially what happens... So why does your rights trump theirs?
[03:08:22.954 --> 03:08:24.514]  That's exactly the thing.
[03:08:24.534 --> 03:08:33.159]  That's why the tribunal member is coming to a balancing act to see how rights play out in this whole thing.
[03:08:34.045 --> 03:08:37.127]  I mean, that's the concern I have.
[03:08:37.467 --> 03:08:38.407]  I mean, look, I've no problem.
[03:08:38.427 --> 03:08:41.469]  You do what you want to do, Jessica, and you live your life whatever way you want to live your life.
[03:08:41.789 --> 03:08:46.152]  But the concern I have is that those women should also be allowed to live their lives the way they want to live their lives.
[03:08:46.352 --> 03:08:49.113]  But not when they discriminate against the rights of others.
[03:08:49.193 --> 03:09:01.140]  But they'll argue that they're not discriminating, that they're just saying, I'm sorry, we don't supply a service of a bikini wax or a Brazilian or whatever it happens to be, or the removal of hair from a genitalia, from a man, as far as they're concerned.
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:03.021]  Because it's male genitalia.
[03:09:03.661 --> 03:09:05.302]  And that's what they're saying.
[03:09:05.382 --> 03:09:07.583]  They're saying we shouldn't be forced to do that.
[03:09:08.804 --> 03:09:09.985]  Oh, have we lost his line there?
[03:09:10.205 --> 03:09:10.485]  Hello?
[03:09:10.685 --> 03:09:10.965]  You there?
[03:09:10.985 --> 03:09:12.246]  We'll try and get him back in a second.
[03:09:12.306 --> 03:09:13.346]  He seems to have lost the line.
[03:09:13.507 --> 03:09:14.147]  Have we lost our line?
[03:09:14.387 --> 03:09:14.707]  Is she gone?
[03:09:15.147 --> 03:09:15.388]  Okay.
[03:09:16.428 --> 03:09:23.552]  So, later on on Twitter, Jessica Keeney admitted that she hung up on that radio host who challenged her.
[03:09:24.433 --> 03:09:25.353]  So she did hang up.
[03:09:25.413 --> 03:09:26.794]  It wasn't just the line that was lost.
[03:09:27.566 --> 03:09:36.851]  The other aspect of this, whether it's a troll or not, it could be a giant troll, it could be an actual anti-identity politics troll, but it's still disgusting in every way imaginable.
[03:09:37.631 --> 03:09:43.855]  But the real world effect, or at least the online effect, is people are getting banned for challenging this individual, including a feminist.
[03:09:44.671 --> 03:09:54.157]  It was, I think, banned several months ago for misgendering Jessica Yeniv, and the free speech activist Lindsey Shepard was also banned a few days ago.
[03:09:54.177 --> 03:10:00.662]  Yeniv basically made fun of her reproductive abnormality and Lindsey Shepard responded
[03:10:01.753 --> 03:10:06.934]  By saying something like, I forget the exact quote, but it was something like, well at least I have a uterus.
[03:10:07.295 --> 03:10:14.116]  Of course in the world of Twitter's terms of service, where you can actually organise violence against people if you're Antifa, that's fine.
[03:10:14.437 --> 03:10:19.578]  The Rose City Antifa account that assaulted Andy Ngo, the journalist, still has their account.
[03:10:20.238 --> 03:10:25.941]  She committed the mortal sin of misgendering Jessica Yeniv, and her Twitter account is banned forever.
[03:10:26.521 --> 03:10:29.603]  And Lindsey Shepard put out a video explaining what happened.
[03:10:29.623 --> 03:10:30.843]  This is a five-minute clip.
[03:10:30.863 --> 03:10:32.084]  We're going to go to it right now.
[03:10:32.484 --> 03:10:36.546]  This is Lindsey Shepard, free speech activist, on why she was banned by Twitter.
[03:10:36.586 --> 03:10:36.966]  Here it is.
[03:10:36.986 --> 03:10:38.727]  Hi everyone.
[03:10:39.768 --> 03:10:41.829]  I have been permanently banned from Twitter.
[03:10:42.529 --> 03:10:45.991]  And yes, I did file an appeal, but it was quickly denied.
[03:10:47.287 --> 03:11:03.556]  You may have watched the video that I made last night where I talk about this same topic, my Twitter ban, but I had to take it down and give it another shot because I had to make some corrections in order to comply with a publication ban.
[03:11:04.956 --> 03:11:13.961]  I was banned from Twitter for responding to a couple of tweets that an individual that I will only refer to as JY made about me.
[03:11:14.946 --> 03:11:20.508]  So, J-Y has a very complicated backstory that is getting more and more disjointed.
[03:11:21.108 --> 03:11:36.975]  So, all I'm going to say here is that J-Y purports to be a transgender woman, and J-Y is someone that lives in the same province that I do, which is why I probably feel a little more invested in this issue than other people who don't live in this province.
[03:11:38.211 --> 03:11:48.360]  There are leaked Facebook message screenshots where JY is trying to get advice on how to approach preteen girls in the female washrooms.
[03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:54.605]  And he says things like, Can you see tampon strings hanging out of a girl's pussy?
[03:11:55.686 --> 03:11:57.948]  What do girls do in the bathroom stall?
[03:11:58.748 --> 03:12:01.751]  Wipe pussy and change panty liner?
[03:12:03.072 --> 03:12:05.634]  Oh, I'm going on the BC Ferries next week.
[03:12:06.061 --> 03:12:09.263]  And lots of 10-year-old girls go on field trips on the ferry.
[03:12:09.784 --> 03:12:12.426]  How can I ask them for a tampon or pad?
[03:12:13.066 --> 03:12:16.649]  Should I teach a 10-year-old girl how to use a tampon?
[03:12:17.890 --> 03:12:23.694]  Yes, JY is very obsessed with the menstrual products of 10 to 12-year-old girls.
[03:12:25.015 --> 03:12:35.323]  So, JY on Twitter starts tweeting about how I'm dumb and how I have a loose vagina from pushing out a 10-pound baby.
[03:12:36.559 --> 03:12:39.461]  But, JY has a tight pussy.
[03:12:40.722 --> 03:12:49.607]  So, I tweeted back and basically said, if you want to sound like a woman, this is not really the way to do it because this is more of a male way of speaking.
[03:12:51.389 --> 03:12:57.232]  I said, he sounds like a guy who doesn't have a functional romantic relationship with a woman.
[03:12:57.753 --> 03:12:59.594]  But, I guess that describes him pretty well.
[03:13:01.229 --> 03:13:15.479]  Then, JY starts mocking how I have a reproductive abnormality called a septate uterus, and then I reply and I say, at least I have a uterus, you ugly fat man.
[03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:22.524]  I deleted the tweets in the morning when I woke up, but was permanently suspended by the afternoon.
[03:13:23.805 --> 03:13:27.707]  Some people have said that I should have never engaged with JY online.
[03:13:28.268 --> 03:13:29.849]  I shouldn't have sunk to his level.
[03:13:30.592 --> 03:13:35.857]  But the thing is, this is someone who straight up ruins people's lives.
[03:13:35.937 --> 03:13:38.078]  And I'm not talking about the Twitter bans.
[03:13:38.739 --> 03:13:40.941]  I'm talking about really ruining people's lives.
[03:13:42.881 --> 03:13:49.846]  And the reason I think the J-Y situation is so important is because it proves trans people are untouchable.
[03:13:50.546 --> 03:14:05.336]  J-Y is allowed to make crude and disgusting comments, and misogynistic comments, but when I want to talk back to him, stand up for myself, defend myself, I'm silenced and kicked off of the platform permanently.
[03:14:05.816 --> 03:14:10.920]  But J-Y receives no punishment and remains on the platform.
[03:14:12.520 --> 03:14:16.382]  The moral of the story is, you can't stand up for yourself against a trans person.
[03:14:17.763 --> 03:14:18.844]  Want more evidence of this?
[03:14:19.244 --> 03:14:22.406]  Watch the video I made called, Did I Harass a Trans Person?
[03:14:22.966 --> 03:14:30.750]  I tell the story of a fellow grad student who made a complaint against me at my university.
[03:14:31.290 --> 03:14:37.594]  And he was a trans individual who would always try to instigate conflict with me, and he made a complaint saying I was the problem.
[03:14:38.433 --> 03:14:48.279]  So, when it comes to trans people, they are untouchable, they are beyond criticism, beyond questioning, and you are not allowed to stand up for yourself against them.
[03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:54.543]  And sometimes the comment comes out like, why are you so focused on trans issues?
[03:14:55.383 --> 03:15:04.189]  And it's because, unfortunately, trans activism is one of the major hindrances to free speech and open inquiry in this country.
[03:15:04.269 --> 03:15:06.230]  It's not the number one hindrance.
[03:15:07.970 --> 03:15:15.554]  Trans activism is responsible for silencing and stifling so many discussions that we need to have in our society.
[03:15:15.714 --> 03:15:21.377]  So thank you so much to everyone that is bringing attention to my Twitter ban and to the JY situation.
[03:15:21.417 --> 03:15:23.699]  I've already received so many kind messages.
[03:15:24.679 --> 03:15:33.564]  For the next little while, I will only be on YouTube until I can find another platform to hitch onto, so please do subscribe if you haven't already.
[03:15:34.305 --> 03:15:36.506]  Thanks so much for watching and bye for now!
[03:15:37.654 --> 03:15:43.819]  That was free speech activist Lindsey Shepard banned by Twitter for misgendering Jessica Yaniv.
[03:15:44.059 --> 03:15:45.520]  Is this the biggest troll ever?
[03:15:45.580 --> 03:15:50.084]  Is this actually a troll to frame transgender people and make them look bad?
[03:15:50.144 --> 03:15:51.224]  It's that absurd?
[03:15:51.925 --> 03:15:53.406]  I don't know what's true at this point.
[03:15:53.566 --> 03:15:54.487]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:15:54.527 --> 03:15:55.568]  We'll be back with more news.
[03:15:55.588 --> 03:15:57.609]  This is the Alex Jones Show live fourth hour.
[03:15:57.969 --> 03:15:59.371]  Break your news at infowars.com.
[03:15:59.411 --> 03:15:59.811]  We'll be back.
[03:16:06.067 --> 03:16:07.489]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[03:16:07.529 --> 03:16:08.250]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[03:16:08.270 --> 03:16:08.771]  You're on the air.
[03:16:08.891 --> 03:16:09.412]  Hey, Alex.
[03:16:09.512 --> 03:16:13.538]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[03:16:13.638 --> 03:16:16.102]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[03:16:16.142 --> 03:16:17.784]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[03:16:17.885 --> 03:16:21.410]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[03:16:21.550 --> 03:16:22.391]  We really are.
[03:16:22.411 --> 03:16:23.351]  We really are.
[03:16:23.371 --> 03:16:27.094]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[03:16:27.114 --> 03:16:29.776]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[03:16:29.916 --> 03:16:32.217]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[03:16:32.437 --> 03:16:33.338]  What would you recommend?
[03:16:33.498 --> 03:16:36.140]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[03:16:36.200 --> 03:16:37.981]  What would you recommend for me to purchase?
[03:16:51.550 --> 03:16:51.850]  I don't
[03:17:06.766 --> 03:17:12.510]  I think you should go through the products, everybody is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[03:17:12.550 --> 03:17:20.577]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[03:17:20.917 --> 03:17:21.237]  That's it.
[03:17:21.437 --> 03:17:24.500]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again, I'm a very superstitious person.
[03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:26.261]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[03:17:26.902 --> 03:17:28.224]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:17:28.244 --> 03:17:29.305]  You've got my total commitment.
[03:17:29.566 --> 03:17:36.574]  Anything I do, information, any of it, products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[03:17:36.694 --> 03:17:38.056]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[03:17:38.076 --> 03:17:42.281]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[03:17:42.582 --> 03:17:43.563]  Why'd I do that?
[03:17:43.703 --> 03:17:45.224]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[03:17:45.324 --> 03:17:56.291]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality, because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better, but I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit, and that's what I promote.
[03:17:56.391 --> 03:17:58.152]  So, so, that's my advice on that.
[03:17:58.273 --> 03:17:58.753]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:17:59.153 --> 03:18:05.477]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[03:18:05.537 --> 03:18:07.458]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[03:18:07.558 --> 03:18:08.999]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[03:18:09.700 --> 03:18:16.264]  Well, now listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[03:18:16.464 --> 03:18:21.067]  Most people have almost none of it, but if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you could have some issues.
[03:18:21.227 --> 03:18:22.388]  Detoxing, you name it.
[03:18:22.448 --> 03:18:25.089]  I mean, this is it, man.
[03:18:25.250 --> 03:18:26.650]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[03:18:26.791 --> 03:18:27.411]  It's dangerous.
[03:18:27.611 --> 03:18:30.313]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[03:18:30.393 --> 03:18:32.234]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[03:18:32.294 --> 03:18:32.994]  You've got to be careful.
[03:18:33.055 --> 03:18:36.857]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[03:18:36.957 --> 03:18:38.478]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[03:18:39.659 --> 03:18:41.180]  Your organs, everything operates.
[03:18:41.380 --> 03:18:43.541]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[03:18:43.661 --> 03:18:47.244]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[03:18:47.324 --> 03:18:48.264]  So this is the good thing.
[03:18:48.304 --> 03:18:51.266]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the kick in the head by a mule.
[03:18:51.286 --> 03:18:52.547]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[03:18:52.607 --> 03:18:53.468]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[03:18:53.608 --> 03:18:55.489]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[03:18:55.609 --> 03:18:57.271]  We just researched what the globalists are doing.
[03:18:57.431 --> 03:18:58.212]  We do the opposite.
[03:18:58.252 --> 03:19:03.918]  But yes, everyone with X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[03:19:04.019 --> 03:19:05.000]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:08.984]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[03:19:09.004 --> 03:19:09.905]  So I'm going to explain it again.
[03:19:10.606 --> 03:19:12.107]  Iodine, you die.
[03:19:12.127 --> 03:19:13.688]  The fields are depleted.
[03:19:13.828 --> 03:19:14.628]  Everything's depleted.
[03:19:14.809 --> 03:19:20.312]  Most iodine is bound to iron or copper or lead or something else.
[03:19:20.352 --> 03:19:21.192]  You don't get it.
[03:19:21.312 --> 03:19:23.934]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[03:19:24.194 --> 03:19:25.195]  So yeah, be careful.
[03:19:25.375 --> 03:19:26.656]  Iodine, you have to have.
[03:19:27.376 --> 03:19:29.139]  It's just paramount.
[03:19:29.739 --> 03:19:31.582]  And so that's why we sell it.
[03:19:31.662 --> 03:19:35.167]  That's why we've hyped it up because it's what they don't want you to have.
[03:19:35.207 --> 03:19:40.073]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had an eye on it for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring.
[03:19:40.274 --> 03:19:43.518]  And you get the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell?
[03:19:43.558 --> 03:19:44.498]  What the hell is that?
[03:19:44.719 --> 03:19:46.019]  Because you've never had it.
[03:19:46.239 --> 03:19:47.120]  It's just iodine.
[03:19:47.200 --> 03:19:48.940]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[03:19:49.181 --> 03:19:51.502]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:51.522 --> 03:19:55.804]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products, and it helps fund this operation.
[03:19:55.964 --> 03:19:58.585]  A total 360 win, and you know I love those.
[03:20:06.208 --> 03:20:08.850]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.813 --> 03:20:26.399]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.879 --> 03:20:30.722]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:32.504 --> 03:20:36.687]  We are back and we've stopped talking about Jessica Yenny, which most of you will be delighted about.
[03:20:37.808 --> 03:20:39.029]  A few months ago on Twitter,
[03:20:40.371 --> 03:20:46.735]  I put in my Twitter bio he him as my preferred pronouns as a joke.
[03:20:47.436 --> 03:20:50.318]  I removed them later but I put them in for a few weeks as a joke.
[03:20:51.138 --> 03:20:53.180]  Now we have this headline out of the Daily Caller.
[03:20:53.540 --> 03:20:57.803]  These 2020 Democrats have their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios.
[03:21:01.155 --> 03:21:08.721]  Of course, there are no transgender Democrat 2020 presidential candidates so far, at least, or any who have identified as transgender.
[03:21:09.241 --> 03:21:15.446]  But three prominent Democratic presidential candidates have their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios.
[03:21:15.986 --> 03:21:25.193]  Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro's bio declares, he, him, L. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's bio says, he, him.
[03:21:25.213 --> 03:21:27.735]  That's literally what I did as a joke.
[03:21:28.616 --> 03:21:31.798]  Now Bill de Blasio, the Mayor of New York City, has it.
[03:21:32.458 --> 03:21:35.840]  And Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's bio says she, her.
[03:21:37.121 --> 03:21:41.684]  Castro was the first candidate to add his preferred gender pronouns to his Twitter bio on July 1st.
[03:21:42.124 --> 03:21:45.146]  So this is something that's happened in the last three weeks.
[03:21:45.586 --> 03:21:50.269]  They've started putting their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios.
[03:21:50.769 --> 03:21:53.671]  My prediction is that all the other candidates, or most of them,
[03:21:54.668 --> 03:21:55.149]  We're good to go.
[03:22:12.378 --> 03:22:13.399]  She came out with a tweet.
[03:22:13.499 --> 03:22:25.786]  Now there was a Louisiana police officer who said about AOC, quote, she needs a round and I don't mean the kind she used to serve, which of course is completely disgusting and that kind of language should not be tolerated.
[03:22:26.326 --> 03:22:29.188]  But of course, what did AOC do in response to it?
[03:22:29.228 --> 03:22:31.990]  She fed it into her Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:22:33.422 --> 03:22:43.710]  Of course, death threats are horrible, targeted against anyone, but she exploited it by saying, this is Trump's goal when he uses targeted language and threatens elected officials who don't agree with his political agenda.
[03:22:44.071 --> 03:22:45.772]  It's authoritarian behavior.
[03:22:46.072 --> 03:22:47.693]  The president is sowing violence.
[03:22:47.713 --> 03:22:52.337]  He's creating an environment where people can get hurt, and he claims plausible deniability.
[03:22:52.737 --> 03:23:00.724]  Now, this, of course, is within the environment of Democrats repeatedly telling their voters, their supporters, to go out and harass
[03:23:01.545 --> 03:23:06.107]  Trump supporters in restaurants, wherever they may be, as Maxine Waters said, of course.
[03:23:07.268 --> 03:23:20.815]  And in the case of AOC, this is pretty rich because the domestic Antifa terrorist, who literally tried to massacre ICE agents and firebomb an ICE facility in Washington State last weekend,
[03:23:21.604 --> 03:23:33.320]  Put out a manifesto in which he specifically used the term concentration camps numerous times, which of course was the term applied to border detention centres.
[03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:36.204]  They're not concentration camps, that's completely ludicrous.
[03:23:36.952 --> 03:23:48.455]  Actual Holocaust victims have condemned her for using that language, and that language was used numerous times by Willem van Spronsen, the Antifa terrorist who tried to massacre ICE agents.
[03:23:48.495 --> 03:23:51.695]  You remember the story, quickly buried by the mainstream media.
[03:23:52.075 --> 03:23:55.016]  It actually wasn't even played up by quote right-wing media.
[03:23:55.656 --> 03:23:57.697]  There were a couple of Fox News stories about it.
[03:23:57.717 --> 03:23:59.757]  It was never really played up as a big story.
[03:24:00.620 --> 03:24:07.265]  But it was literally a domestic terrorist radicalized by the kind of rhetoric that AOC is responsible for.
[03:24:07.585 --> 03:24:09.526]  Does that mean she's responsible for the attack?
[03:24:09.607 --> 03:24:11.108]  No, that's not how it works.
[03:24:11.488 --> 03:24:29.621]  But you could at least say that it looks like he's been radicalized by that kind of rhetoric because he wrote in his manifesto, quote, it's time to take action against the forces of evil, citing in part, quote, highly profitable detention slash concentration camps and a battle over the semantics.
[03:24:30.439 --> 03:24:39.769]  Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly referred to immigration detention facilities as concentration camps, despite vociferous complaints from actual Holocaust survivors.
[03:24:40.870 --> 03:24:42.232]  Ryan Severeda tweeted,
[03:24:42.964 --> 03:24:47.525]  Ocasio-Cortez claims without evidence that Trump is intentionally trying to get her assassinated.
[03:24:48.165 --> 03:24:53.626]  Last week, a domestic terrorist attacked an ICE facility and used AOC's rhetoric in his manifesto.
[03:24:54.026 --> 03:24:56.867]  AOC has refused to condemn the terrorist attack.
[03:24:57.347 --> 03:25:07.509]  You remember the video where Rebel Media reporter confronted both AOC and Ilhan Omar in the halls of Congress asking them, will you denounce this Antifa attack?
[03:25:07.569 --> 03:25:09.729]  It's very easy to denounce a terrorist attack.
[03:25:10.229 --> 03:25:11.330]  They refused to do so.
[03:25:11.370 --> 03:25:13.811]  They said, oh, we'll put out a statement on it later.
[03:25:14.251 --> 03:25:15.572]  That statement never came.
[03:25:16.072 --> 03:25:28.178]  So she's accusing Trump of being responsible for this Louisiana police officer's death threat, when a terrorist who tried to massacre ICE agents literally used her rhetoric just 10 days prior to that.
[03:25:28.819 --> 03:25:39.504]  And talking about violent assaults and threats, Cory Spartacus Bucca is now dreaming, fantasizing about violently assaulting President Trump.
[03:25:40.706 --> 03:25:47.290]  Headline out, Zero Hedge, Cory Spartacus' booker wants to assault Trump, blames testosterone for violent fantasies.
[03:25:48.850 --> 03:26:01.697]  So he appeared on The Late Show with Seth Meyers last night, and he relayed a story from an Iowa campaign event where dozens of people showed up, one of whom told him to, quote, punch Donald Trump in the face.
[03:26:02.318 --> 03:26:09.902]  Because this is the new face of tolerance, is to violently attack anyone who has a different opinion to you, because they're all Nazis.
[03:26:10.999 --> 03:26:16.987]  Dude, that's a felony, man, Booker replied before launching into his deep-seated desire to assault the President.
[03:26:17.668 --> 03:26:29.823]  He said, quote, Donald Trump is a guy who you understand he hurts you, and my testosterone sometimes makes me want to feel like punching him, which would be bad for this elderly, out-of-shape man that he is if I did that.
[03:26:30.330 --> 03:26:37.534]  And then he went on to call Trump a quote physically weak specimen and then he accused Trump of being a body shamer.
[03:26:37.934 --> 03:26:51.160]  So he's saying it's okay to assault Trump violently because he's a body shamer while at the same time calling Trump out of shape and a physically weak specimen which of course is the epitome of body shaming.
[03:26:53.261 --> 03:26:56.703]  He went on to say quote that's his tactics and you don't beat a bully like him
[03:26:57.620 --> 03:27:00.404]  Fighting him on his tactics, on his terms, using his turf.
[03:27:00.464 --> 03:27:04.970]  He's the body shamer, Cory Booker said after literally just body shaming Trump.
[03:27:05.511 --> 03:27:08.014]  He's the guy that tries to drag people in the gutter.
[03:27:08.294 --> 03:27:14.783]  So he's literally fantasizing about violently attacking Trump because he's a body shamer while he's just body shamed Trump.
[03:27:16.377 --> 03:27:29.862]  Zero Hedge asks, did Booker's testosterone make him similarly feel like sexually assaulting a girl in high school when he, quote, slowly reached for her breast only for her to push his hand away once he reached his mark?
[03:27:30.782 --> 03:27:35.584]  And they provide the newspaper article where that alleged sexual assault is documented.
[03:27:36.705 --> 03:27:37.325]  Goes on to say,
[03:27:38.041 --> 03:27:54.359]  Was Booker's out-of-control testosterone responsible for a credible allegation, his phrase, that he sexually assaulted a man, whether or not he identified as a man remains to be seen, could have been Jessica Yeniv, in a public restroom, and then they detail that allegation.
[03:27:54.958 --> 03:28:07.964]  And did Booker fail to constrain his toxic masculinity when he browbeat former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last January over President Trump's comment that Haiti and parts of Africa are S-hole countries?
[03:28:08.144 --> 03:28:11.286]  Sounds like Spartacus needs to get this under control.
[03:28:12.046 --> 03:28:15.608]  So once again you have the Democrats whining about violent rhetoric all day.
[03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:30.436]  When their supporters are literally in the streets, and let's not forget that CNN has done glorification pieces about Antifa over and over again, their journalists, including Cuomo, have repeatedly praised Antifa.
[03:28:31.076 --> 03:28:32.817]  They're attacking journalists in the street.
[03:28:32.877 --> 03:28:37.319]  We had an Antifa domestic terrorist tried to blow up an ICE facility, citing
[03:28:38.158 --> 03:28:40.960]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rhetoric, but no.
[03:28:41.380 --> 03:28:49.024]  Donald Trump's bad because he body shames people and he deserves to be violently assaulted in the crazed mind of Cory Booker.
[03:28:49.224 --> 03:28:50.324]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:28:50.805 --> 03:28:51.265]  We'll be back.
[03:28:51.305 --> 03:28:54.286]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:28:54.507 --> 03:28:55.047]  Don't go away.
[03:29:04.418 --> 03:29:08.205]  The globalists hate free speech, and they hate empowering the people.
[03:29:08.586 --> 03:29:12.874]  The entire dying dinosaur corporate media, CNN, MSNBC...
[03:29:14.332 --> 03:29:19.115]  Bombard the public with anti-American, anti-family, anti-God, anti-gun messages.
[03:29:19.335 --> 03:29:20.075]  People are sick of them.
[03:29:20.936 --> 03:29:23.517]  Well, Subscribestar.com's exploded.
[03:29:23.957 --> 03:29:27.179]  We have our own account at Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[03:29:27.859 --> 03:29:41.067]  And six days a week, Monday through Friday, and then on Sundays, Monday to Sunday show, I'm going to take questions off Subscribestar, where you private message me, and I'm going to answer those questions on air, starting today.
[03:29:41.767 --> 03:29:44.229]  So, Infowars.com is a great place to visit.
[03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:51.554]  And Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones is the place to ask direct questions and I will answer them on air.

[03:30:02.121 --> 03:30:06.384]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[03:30:06.764 --> 03:30:07.424]  James, you're on the air.
[03:30:07.444 --> 03:30:08.005]  Thanks for calling.
[03:30:09.722 --> 03:30:10.303]  Hello, Alex.
[03:30:10.923 --> 03:30:12.784]  God bless General Jones.
[03:30:12.844 --> 03:30:15.026]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[03:30:15.066 --> 03:30:16.126]  In Christ's name, we pray.
[03:30:16.246 --> 03:30:16.987]  God bless you, brother.
[03:30:17.207 --> 03:30:18.488]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[03:30:18.508 --> 03:30:21.810]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years and we were never able to have kids.
[03:30:21.930 --> 03:30:31.056]  And after a couple of years of taking the B12 and the iodine and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant, six-stroke boy.
[03:30:31.176 --> 03:30:32.417]  And I thank you very much for that.
[03:30:32.537 --> 03:30:35.199]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[03:30:35.660 --> 03:30:38.662]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[03:30:39.122 --> 03:30:40.223]  So that's a beautiful story.
[03:30:40.243 --> 03:30:41.244]  That's exciting, my friend.
[03:30:41.404 --> 03:30:45.628]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[03:30:46.188 --> 03:30:46.629]  You name it.
[03:30:46.889 --> 03:30:50.932]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[03:30:50.952 --> 03:30:53.254]  Even though I get it from mformorestore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[03:30:53.314 --> 03:30:55.596]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[03:30:55.736 --> 03:30:58.879]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[03:30:59.059 --> 03:31:22.588]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we got out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and then you're our hero Alex.
[03:31:22.748 --> 03:31:24.069]  Well, that's just beautiful, brother.
[03:31:24.369 --> 03:31:27.510]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:32.192]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[03:31:32.232 --> 03:31:34.773]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[03:31:35.093 --> 03:31:35.974]  You have to have water.
[03:31:36.294 --> 03:31:37.294]  You have to have oxygen.
[03:31:37.414 --> 03:31:40.055]  But instead, the whole system works to block that.
[03:31:40.175 --> 03:31:41.156]  It's just so powerful.
[03:31:41.556 --> 03:31:42.356]  That's what we're made of.
[03:31:42.456 --> 03:31:44.738]  And I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[03:31:44.758 --> 03:31:46.178]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[03:31:46.358 --> 03:31:47.459]  It's just everything.
[03:31:47.499 --> 03:31:49.380]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[03:31:49.440 --> 03:31:50.500]  You don't absorb them.
[03:31:50.940 --> 03:31:52.361]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[03:31:52.601 --> 03:31:55.022]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[03:31:55.122 --> 03:31:55.523]  They're not.
[03:31:55.683 --> 03:31:59.084]  Impolwarestore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:31:59.104 --> 03:32:08.769]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[03:32:15.060 --> 03:32:16.962]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[03:32:17.502 --> 03:32:26.149]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.
[03:32:26.229 --> 03:32:31.653]  You can also get the same Don't Tread on Me t-shirt that Chris Pratt was wearing.
[03:32:32.093 --> 03:32:41.141]  By purchasing these t-shirts, you're not only supporting your country and your president, but you're supporting me and helping make sure I can keep making these videos you love.
[03:32:41.721 --> 03:32:49.867]  They're only printing a limited supply of these t-shirts, so make sure you get yours right now at InfoWarsStore.com before they sell out.
[03:32:50.407 --> 03:32:53.089]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[03:32:53.109 --> 03:32:57.432]  Flawless victory.
[03:33:06.199 --> 03:33:08.841]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.958 --> 03:33:20.838]  You found it.
[03:33:21.178 --> 03:33:22.719]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:23.219 --> 03:33:25.680]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.220 --> 03:33:30.341]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:32.001 --> 03:33:33.402]  We are back, live.
[03:33:33.542 --> 03:33:48.506]  I'm going to get into some more news here in a second, play a Mark Dice video about Bernie Sanders advocating for the minimum wage, campaigning for the $15 minimum wage, but not quite seeing it through when it comes to his own campaign staff.
[03:33:50.114 --> 03:34:04.039]  Meantime, I want to encourage everyone to go to InfoWarsStore.com, where, as per usual, we have a raft of absolutely mammoth discounts on great products, including 40% off InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[03:34:49.057 --> 03:34:51.798]  That was already basically dirt cheap.
[03:34:51.878 --> 03:34:54.059]  I've tried to buy storable food in Europe before.
[03:34:54.279 --> 03:34:56.200]  The costs are absolutely prohibitive.
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:34:58.881]  It's literally thousands and thousands of dollars.
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:06.915]  For a tiny portion in comparison to what we're offering at InfoWarsStore.com for up to 50% off.

[03:35:31.883 --> 03:35:37.785]  Headline, Bernie Sanders mocked for admitting he will have to cut staff hours to pay them $15 minimum wage.
[03:35:38.325 --> 03:35:42.526]  Not quite carrying through on the exact policy he's campaigning for.
[03:35:42.546 --> 03:35:46.267]  And Mark Dice put out a video today on this very subject.
[03:35:46.307 --> 03:35:46.748]  Here it is.
[03:35:46.768 --> 03:35:54.710]  Sanders lectures corporations that they need to start paying their workers at least $15 an hour.
[03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:59.612]  And if he becomes president, he's going to raise the national minimum wage to just that.
[03:35:59.832 --> 03:36:00.572]  Corporations.
[03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:06.796]  Like Walmart, like the fast food industry, like retail in general.
[03:36:10.197 --> 03:36:29.547]  But since liberals live by the philosophy of do what they say, not what they do, I'm sure you won't be surprised to learn that Bernie Sanders has been paying his campaign staff less than that.
[03:36:30.327 --> 03:36:31.468]  And they're not happy about it.
[03:36:32.508 --> 03:36:39.692]  Bernie Sanders campaign workers demand the $15 an hour pay that the candidate has proposed for employees nationwide!
[03:36:40.032 --> 03:36:47.216]  How embarrassing is it gonna be for these people to work for a guy who's promising a $15 minimum wage for everybody in America when he's not even paying them that!
[03:36:47.496 --> 03:36:52.258]  So out of embarrassment, since this has been making headlines recently, Bernie's decided to give everybody a raise!
[03:36:52.398 --> 03:36:55.340]  But in order to pay for it, he's cutting back on their hours!
[03:36:55.700 --> 03:36:59.682]  This is probably the best economic lesson that these staffers are ever going to get in their entire lives.
[03:36:59.942 --> 03:37:01.582]  You see, liberals, a pie is only so big.
[03:37:01.782 --> 03:37:05.224]  And the more pieces you try to cut out of it, the smaller those pieces are!
[03:37:05.524 --> 03:37:11.846]  The $15 an hour minimum wage is basically the agreed upon talking point by all the Democrat candidates running for president.
[03:37:12.006 --> 03:37:16.828]  But as you know, the Democrats these days keep trying to one-up each other in terms of who can offer more free stuff.
[03:37:17.128 --> 03:37:20.669]  So Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is now saying it should be $20 an hour!
[03:37:22.090 --> 03:37:22.971]  We're good to go.
[03:37:39.445 --> 03:37:51.832]  That's a great idea, Rashida, especially since the Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that if the minimum wage is raised to just $15 an hour, it'll actually end up costing Americans 1.3 million jobs.
[03:37:52.213 --> 03:38:02.078]  There's a reason we keep seeing more and more kiosks at fast food restaurants, grocery stores, and home improvement stores, because if they're gonna have to pay people $15 an hour, they're just gonna replace it with a computer.
[03:38:02.398 --> 03:38:05.420]  All the regulars at CNN must be on summer vacation this week,
[03:38:05.520 --> 03:38:18.850]  Because the woman who interviewed Kamala Harris yesterday actually asked her some real questions and pointed out the fact that her Medicare for All plan actually won't work unless she dramatically raises taxes on the middle class, which Kamala says she's just not going to do.
[03:38:19.351 --> 03:38:21.412]  And all of a sudden, without a middle class tax hike.
[03:38:21.792 --> 03:38:23.394]  Without a middle class tax hike, yes.
[03:38:24.233 --> 03:38:25.835]  30 trillion over 10 years.
[03:38:26.615 --> 03:38:37.185]  And when people question that there is no formula for this, that you are going to find money in magical ways, is not realistic thinking.
[03:38:37.385 --> 03:38:38.366]  How do you respond to that?
[03:38:40.314 --> 03:38:41.815]  The status quo is not enough.
[03:38:42.415 --> 03:38:47.698]  I'm not sure what this woman is doing on CNN because these are the kinds of questions that are asked on our Real News Network.
[03:38:47.918 --> 03:38:49.499]  There must be some mistake here.
[03:38:49.919 --> 03:39:02.886]  More evidence that everybody at CNN is on summer vacation this week is this woman who also appeared on air to explain that Elizabeth Warren's supposed plan to prevent another economic crisis would, in fact, cause one.
[03:39:03.146 --> 03:39:13.875]  Now, as far as her policy proposals, she is recommending lowering rents, offering affordable child care, offering free tuition at colleges.
[03:39:14.275 --> 03:39:18.439]  All of that costs money, and the American public should be asking, how do you pay for it?
[03:39:18.619 --> 03:39:20.180]  One way would be to increase taxes.
[03:39:20.521 --> 03:39:23.283]  Another way is to increase government debt.
[03:39:23.703 --> 03:39:31.370]  This is the issue that the American people should be actually focused on, because many experts say, if we don't get control of our debt,
[03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:40.178]  Over the next 10 years, we could be facing a fiscal crisis, and that would be extraordinarily harmful to our economy.
[03:39:40.278 --> 03:39:48.266]  At some point in the future, and I don't know when, it could be 10 or 20 years down the road, this country's gonna have a huge, huge problem, and we probably will go bankrupt.
[03:39:48.526 --> 03:39:54.592]  There's too much debt, the government's too big, there's too many entitlements, and someday they're gonna probably hyperinflate the dollar into oblivion.
[03:39:55.112 --> 03:40:10.079]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property.
[03:40:10.279 --> 03:40:15.560]  Until their children will wake up homeless on the very continent their fathers conquered!
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:24.383]  President Trump really is this country's last hope, and he's holding back the dam from bursting, but it's still building pressure and leaking like a sieve, and when he's out of office, look out.
[03:40:24.743 --> 03:40:29.824]  Hopefully that won't be for another six years, and we can all stay busy working to restore our republic.
[03:40:31.084 --> 03:40:37.226]  That was Mark Nye talking about Bernie Sanders not following through on his $15 minimum wage promise within his own campaign,
[03:40:38.348 --> 03:40:47.691]  For all his faults, though, Bernie Sanders does recognise that you can't have a giant welfare state and mass migration at the same time, which brings me on to this headline.
[03:40:49.031 --> 03:40:52.812]  Time Magazine calls for migration brainwashing courses in schools.
[03:40:53.472 --> 03:40:55.673]  Now, this was an article in Time Magazine.
[03:40:55.733 --> 03:41:00.694]  It was written by a group, a couple of individuals from a group called ISD.
[03:41:01.535 --> 03:41:02.615]  What is ISD?
[03:41:02.635 --> 03:41:05.716]  Well, they work with governments to combat extremism.
[03:41:06.405 --> 03:41:19.411]  Now, lo and behold, I looked at their website and looked at who funded ISD, this group that is literally pushing for migration brainwashing courses to be introduced in schools to push the idea that it's always positive.
[03:41:20.291 --> 03:41:26.094]  And imagine my shock, they're funded by the United Nations Development Programme, Google, Facebook, the European Commission.
[03:41:27.282 --> 03:41:32.303]  And Open Society Foundations, which of course is George Soros.
[03:41:32.323 --> 03:41:41.906]  But you can't mention that anyone is funded by Open Society Foundations, even though literally dozens of major NGOs are, because of course that's anti-Semitic.
[03:41:42.266 --> 03:41:46.267]  The article threats about how popular support for politicians who build their campaigns around
[03:41:46.807 --> 03:41:52.412]  Isn't it amazing how you can only talk about the demographic decline of white voters if you're doing so in a positive context?
[03:41:52.432 --> 03:41:55.054]  In fact, on the very day this article was published, Axios published another article
[03:42:13.619 --> 03:42:19.764]  Saying that the Republicans are in big trouble because their white demographic voting base is swiftly disappearing.
[03:42:20.264 --> 03:42:27.290]  That's okay to talk about the demographic decline of white people, so long as you say it's a fantastic thing.
[03:42:27.690 --> 03:42:36.637]  If you dare suggest that there might be any negative consequences, then you're engaging in neo-Nazi rhetoric.
[03:42:37.313 --> 03:42:44.699]  And now they want public brainwashing courses introduced into schools to try and combat anyone who criticizes mass migration.
[03:42:45.159 --> 03:42:56.988]  And by the way, they also included me in a report about the Swedish election, complaining about the fact that I influenced the Swedish election because of my videos about the problems caused by mass migration in Sweden.
[03:42:57.208 --> 03:42:58.249]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:42:58.569 --> 03:42:59.650]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:59.690 --> 03:43:00.611]  InfoWars.com.
[03:43:00.651 --> 03:43:01.091]  We'll be back.
[03:43:07.256 --> 03:43:13.766]  We're gonna move to the East, to the Horn of Africa and Somalia, the most dangerous, backward, evil country in the world.
[03:43:13.786 --> 03:43:15.829]  And you know why Somalia is so bad?
[03:43:17.311 --> 03:43:23.379]  Because African countries all around it have driven the Arab slavers.
[03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:34.697]  In the last thousand years, the Muslim slavers into the Horn of Africa, where it was the center of the slave trade of Africans all over the world.
[03:43:34.857 --> 03:43:38.339]  Once the Roman Empire fell, white slaves were the main slave group.
[03:43:38.479 --> 03:43:40.240]  Africans that were rich had white slaves.
[03:43:40.260 --> 03:43:42.822]  It was just because that's who was trained and where they got slaves.
[03:43:42.842 --> 03:43:44.783]  It was Gaul, that's France today.
[03:43:45.024 --> 03:43:47.645]  Germania, which is Austria and Germany.
[03:43:47.885 --> 03:43:52.769]  The British and others, who they called Gaelic, out of, what's the UK today?
[03:43:52.989 --> 03:43:54.510]  Old Albion, England.
[03:43:54.810 --> 03:44:05.185]  But after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Western Empire, then the fall of the Eastern Empire, Constantinople, when the Islamists took it, civilization collapsed in Western Europe.
[03:44:05.245 --> 03:44:07.989]  And there wasn't any good slaves being brought in anymore.
[03:44:08.149 --> 03:44:10.993]  And so the Muslims started enslaving
[03:44:12.396 --> 03:44:13.197]  Africans.
[03:44:13.697 --> 03:44:15.458]  Over a thousand years ago.
[03:44:15.698 --> 03:44:18.600]  And that's why Ilhan Omar doesn't look African.
[03:44:18.660 --> 03:44:20.701]  She's an elite Somali.
[03:44:20.861 --> 03:44:23.623]  The upper-class Somalis are light-skinned.
[03:44:23.763 --> 03:44:27.185]  They are Muslims and they are slave traffickers.
[03:44:27.465 --> 03:44:31.588]  They sell black slaves today to four countries that still allow slavery.
[03:44:31.748 --> 03:44:35.010]  It's still customary in several Arab countries to have black house slaves.
[03:44:35.230 --> 03:44:36.251]  That's the truth, folks.
[03:44:36.451 --> 03:44:37.392]  That's what they don't want you to know.
[03:44:37.672 --> 03:44:39.913]  I bet you a lot of money she comes from slavers.
[03:44:40.274 --> 03:44:47.498]  And you're literally looking at someone that comes from the hub of a thousand years of black slavery.
[03:44:47.719 --> 03:44:52.022]  Ilhan Omar, guaranteed in her lineage, is pure slaver.
[03:44:52.182 --> 03:44:57.045]  They ship slaves out of Somalia all the way to Indonesia.
[03:44:57.205 --> 03:45:09.429]  And then as you project out towards the east, to the far east, you will see all the islands and countries they've taken over in the last thousand years since Islam, 1400 years ago, went expansionist.
[03:45:09.589 --> 03:45:12.570]  And again, if you go out into the Pacific Ocean, they're all Muslims!
[03:45:12.970 --> 03:45:15.231]  And they test the genetics, and they're African.
[03:45:15.431 --> 03:45:16.131]  Or African.
[03:45:16.271 --> 03:45:16.751]  Why is that?
[03:45:16.831 --> 03:45:22.373]  Because the Muslims loaded slave ships full of black people and shipped them all over the Pacific.
[03:45:22.433 --> 03:45:24.414]  But you don't even get taught that at university.
[03:45:24.534 --> 03:45:28.375]  And then you don't ever hear that the Muslims are currently still all running that.
[03:45:28.555 --> 03:45:45.541]  From the slavers of Africa, the Horn is where people from Ethiopia and people from Kenya were taken up for over a thousand years and walked, bound as slaves, to be loaded on ships to ship them all over the world, all the way in the Pacific Ocean.
[03:45:46.962 --> 03:45:48.042]  But the white man did it!
[03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:56.219]  Not the precious Muslim, not the precious Islam, when Muhammad was a slaver in Mecca and Medina, where they sold slaves from all over the world.
[03:45:56.299 --> 03:45:59.764]  But see, I'm a bad man, you see, because I, I know the history.
[03:45:59.984 --> 03:46:01.026]  I gotta be shut up!
[03:46:01.346 --> 03:46:02.207]  I'm a white devil!
[03:46:02.998 --> 03:46:08.381]  Everybody wants to get into my country because of all the medicine and all the technology and all the rest of the stuff.
[03:46:08.401 --> 03:46:11.824]  See, I'm the bad guy who doesn't want you to abort your baby no matter what color you are.
[03:46:12.064 --> 03:46:15.886]  And all through here, if you look where Islam is, you wonder how it got all over the world.
[03:46:16.066 --> 03:46:17.947]  That's because of slave ships.
[03:46:18.328 --> 03:46:27.794]  That's because of boobies, which are Islamic pirates who over a thousand years ago robbed Japanese, Chinese ships, you name it, where the term booby trap comes from.
[03:46:28.334 --> 03:46:29.715]  Traps that pirates would lay.
[03:46:29.735 --> 03:46:30.676]  Boobies.
[03:46:31.337 --> 03:46:32.798]  Boobies aren't things that give you milk.
[03:46:33.319 --> 03:46:34.700]  Boobies are things that kill you.
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:36.161]  Boobies are slavers.
[03:46:36.682 --> 03:46:37.843]  Out of Somalia.
[03:46:38.664 --> 03:46:39.585]  And they're arrogant.
[03:46:39.945 --> 03:46:41.166]  And they have a right to rule.
[03:46:41.487 --> 03:46:42.648]  And they'll rob your ship.
[03:46:43.008 --> 03:46:44.009]  And they'll kidnap you.
[03:46:44.049 --> 03:46:45.330]  And they'll kill you in a minute.
[03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:46.792]  And they'll come to your country.
[03:46:47.392 --> 03:46:50.353]  And they'll tell you to bow to them, or you're a racist!
[03:46:50.713 --> 03:46:51.773]  And you know what you do when they do it?
[03:46:52.173 --> 03:46:55.814]  You get on your knees to them, and you say, I'm a piece of crap slaver!
[03:46:56.134 --> 03:46:56.834]  I'm your slave!
[03:46:57.014 --> 03:46:59.255]  And Ilhan says, that's right, dirty American!
[03:46:59.435 --> 03:47:01.975]  You're mine now!
[03:47:06.116 --> 03:47:08.817]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.451 --> 03:47:22.857]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.117 --> 03:47:26.820]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:29.201 --> 03:47:33.103]  We're back and we're going to hit some big final news stories here.
[03:47:33.303 --> 03:47:34.944]  Headline up on summit.news.
[03:47:35.204 --> 03:47:36.524]  Total anarchy.
[03:47:36.685 --> 03:47:41.087]  de Blasio blasted over video showing NYPD cops doused with water.
[03:47:41.587 --> 03:47:43.228]  You may or may not have seen this today.
[03:47:43.768 --> 03:47:54.533]  Similar situation to what happened in London, where a total lack of respect for the police, which was instituted from the top down, led to spiraling crime rates in London.
[03:47:55.307 --> 03:48:00.190]  We had a situation once where, of course, stop and search was heavily restricted because it was called racist.
[03:48:00.931 --> 03:48:08.996]  We had another situation in London where police were told they couldn't chase criminals on mopeds, on scooters, if they weren't wearing helmets.
[03:48:09.056 --> 03:48:15.401]  And it basically ended up in just criminals just openly laughing in the face of police officers as they got away with crimes.
[03:48:15.441 --> 03:48:16.601]  The crime rate spiked.
[03:48:17.702 --> 03:48:21.825]  New York's crime rate has been going down thanks to their tougher policies.
[03:48:22.766 --> 03:48:24.547]  But that could be about to change soon.
[03:48:25.504 --> 03:48:35.347]  And now Mayor Bill de Blasio is facing heat over videos that show NYPD officers getting doused with water with outraged cops blaming de Blasio for being soft on crime.
[03:48:36.447 --> 03:48:39.108]  Now these two incidents happened in Harlem and Brooklyn.
[03:48:39.768 --> 03:48:43.849]  In one case the cops were actually arresting someone and got doused with water.
[03:48:43.909 --> 03:48:46.390]  Somebody threw a bucket at the head of one of these cops.
[03:48:47.208 --> 03:48:50.470]  In the other clip, you show them getting absolutely deluged with water.
[03:48:50.490 --> 03:48:51.992]  They just walk away calmly.
[03:48:52.032 --> 03:48:56.735]  They don't even retaliate, even though that's literally assaulting a police officer.
[03:48:57.075 --> 03:48:57.676]  It's a crime.
[03:48:57.696 --> 03:48:59.177]  They just walk away and do nothing.
[03:49:00.100 --> 03:49:04.104]  Apparently this is because of Mayor Bill de Blasio's softening approach to crime.
[03:49:04.745 --> 03:49:10.650]  Sources within the NYPD said the footage is evidence of wider anarchy taking hold across the city.
[03:49:11.071 --> 03:49:17.897]  Everybody's outraged an NYPD source said it's disgusting, embarrassing, there's lawlessness around here now.
[03:49:19.119 --> 03:49:20.460]  Police Chief Terence Monaghan
[03:49:21.215 --> 03:49:29.859]  Called the footage reprehensible, while another officer blamed the incidents on the NYPD's hands-off approach to these guys that de Blasio has encouraged.
[03:49:30.319 --> 03:49:32.580]  He said, who does that in their right frame of mind?
[03:49:32.620 --> 03:49:37.582]  People who believe there are no consequences, which is exactly what happened in London.
[03:49:38.982 --> 03:49:39.903]  It's total anarchy.
[03:49:39.983 --> 03:49:41.003]  This is very sad.
[03:49:42.164 --> 03:49:50.127]  Pat Lynch, Patrolman's Benevolent Association, said it was anti-police rhetoric that led to what you're seeing right now in these videos.
[03:49:50.754 --> 03:49:53.357]  Creating a culture totally lacking in respect.
[03:49:54.138 --> 03:49:57.402]  He said as police officers we need to draw a line in situations like this.
[03:49:57.422 --> 03:50:00.245]  We need to take action to protect ourselves and the public.
[03:50:00.886 --> 03:50:03.309]  He said the politicians do not care.
[03:50:03.449 --> 03:50:05.852]  Rudy Giuliani also came out and slammed this.
[03:50:07.006 --> 03:50:14.268]  Writing, this disrespect for the uniform in New York City is a result of Democrat, progressive, retrogressive, socialist, mayor.
[03:50:14.828 --> 03:50:17.629]  This is what happens with knee-jerk disrespect for police.
[03:50:17.709 --> 03:50:20.950]  It will only get worse until these left-wing idiots are defeated.
[03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:23.831]  So Rudy Giuliani's calling it out.
[03:50:24.951 --> 03:50:34.193]  Absolutely lawless situation in New York where you can just assault a police officer by throwing a bucket of water at their head and throwing the water over them and basically nothing is done.
[03:50:35.574 --> 03:50:35.994]  Meanwhile,
[03:50:36.784 --> 03:50:48.529]  Megan Rapinoe, everybody's favourite US women's soccer star, who apparently thinks she's Jesus now, complained that her National Anthem protest was not well received despite her being a non-threatening white woman.
[03:50:49.409 --> 03:50:53.271]  Or could it be because she's an obnoxious, insufferable, petulant child?
[03:50:54.031 --> 03:51:02.195]  Rapinoe became one of the first white athletes to kneel during the National Anthem, and subsequently stated, I'll probably never sing the National Anthem again.
[03:51:02.952 --> 03:51:11.955]  You'll also recall that she was involved in that incident where they let the American flag drop on the ground during their celebrations, widely seen as a big insult.
[03:51:13.295 --> 03:51:24.378]  She told CNN's Van Jones that her anti-national anthem protest, in which she kneeled in one case and refused to put her hand on her heart in the other, refused to sing the national anthem.
[03:51:25.358 --> 03:51:31.060]  She said, I actually felt like it was going to be received a little better because she's white and a woman.
[03:51:31.886 --> 03:51:36.029]  She then reeled off a list of vague justifications for protesting against the anthem.
[03:51:36.129 --> 03:51:39.211]  Social justice this, social justice that, blah blah blah.
[03:51:40.551 --> 03:51:46.355]  And of course she was caught on video in an article that we had a couple of weeks ago, ranting, I deserve this!
[03:51:46.795 --> 03:51:53.159]  While holding the World Cup trophy, and appears to attempt to make herself the centre of attention at every available opportunity.
[03:51:53.659 --> 03:51:57.482]  Again, soccer, or football as we call it, is a team game.
[03:51:58.419 --> 03:52:04.200]  When you win, you act humble and you thank the rest of your team members and you console the defeated opposition.
[03:52:05.001 --> 03:52:11.442]  That's the whole idea behind soccer or football as invented in England, the gentleman's game.
[03:52:12.322 --> 03:52:23.045]  But no, she's took it, used it, fed it into her narcissistic zeal to be the centre of attention for everything, and now she's shocked that people don't like her.
[03:52:23.934 --> 03:52:26.357]  Although many people do, of course, the Resistance love her.
[03:52:26.377 --> 03:52:32.142]  They actually did a poll which showed that she would beat President Trump in a hypothetical election.
[03:52:32.803 --> 03:52:40.951]  Whether that poll is accurate, given that all the others before the last election weren't, I would suggest that it's not too on point.
[03:52:41.792 --> 03:52:47.138]  Meanwhile, Google polls veterans out over unacceptable keyword Christian.
[03:52:48.999 --> 03:52:54.742]  Google and YouTube denied an ad for a veterans charity because it deemed Christian to be an unacceptable keyword.
[03:52:55.203 --> 03:52:58.445]  Maybe they should have just called them Easter worshippers.
[03:52:59.305 --> 03:53:03.768]  That's the politically correct term for Christians now, you can't say Christian anymore, it's offensive.
[03:53:06.669 --> 03:53:11.973]  Over in Europe, Algerian soccer fans, France used to colonise us, but today we colonise them.
[03:53:12.393 --> 03:53:14.194]  Last week, and the week before that,
[03:53:15.120 --> 03:53:30.611]  Every other night, or every three nights, in Paris, in Lyon, in Marseille, in these major French cities, after the Algerian soccer team won, and they did end up winning the Africa Cup of Nations, they basically went absolutely crazy, rioted, looted stores.
[03:53:31.391 --> 03:53:36.014]  In one instance, one guy was wielding a chainsaw, throwing objects at police.
[03:53:36.054 --> 03:53:37.395]  This is how they celebrate.
[03:53:37.816 --> 03:53:39.617]  This is their culture.
[03:53:39.817 --> 03:53:41.098]  This is diversity.
[03:53:41.158 --> 03:53:42.399]  This is cultural enrichment.
[03:53:44.258 --> 03:53:49.361]  And one Algeria soccer fan was caught on tape with a message for the French after their Africa Cup of Nations win.
[03:53:49.401 --> 03:53:53.323]  He said, quote, France used to colonize us, but today we colonize them.
[03:53:53.724 --> 03:53:57.346]  Now, you always get football fans who go out and riot.
[03:53:57.386 --> 03:54:00.067]  You've seen it before with basketball fans and things like that.
[03:54:00.728 --> 03:54:03.009]  This seemed overtly political, though, didn't it?
[03:54:03.829 --> 03:54:08.272]  This is basically Islamists bragging about how they're planning on colonizing France.
[03:54:08.632 --> 03:54:13.315]  There was another incident in this article, which the video is down below.
[03:54:14.099 --> 03:54:14.639]  We're good to go.
[03:54:30.194 --> 03:54:38.797]  The fans reportedly stole the women's bags of money with one justifying the act of criminality by asserting, they are women, their place is at home.
[03:54:39.057 --> 03:54:47.100]  And these are the kind of people who feminists want to bring into France and Europe in general en masse for our continued cultural enrichment.
[03:54:48.181 --> 03:54:51.882]  Matteo Salvini doesn't know the interior minister of Italy.
[03:54:51.922 --> 03:54:56.043]  He said Paris and Berlin will no longer impose mass migration on Italy.
[03:54:56.083 --> 03:54:57.684]  The story out of Voice of Europe.
[03:54:58.416 --> 03:55:10.962]  In a letter sent to French Interior Minister Christophe Castanier, Italy's National Populist Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini declared that his country will not bear the brunt of mass migration into Europe.
[03:55:11.902 --> 03:55:19.606]  He said France and Germany cannot decide on migration policies by ignoring the demands of the most exposed countries like us and Malta.
[03:55:20.991 --> 03:55:29.798]  So Salvini again remained steadfast in preventing the cultural enrichment of Italy, which was going so well before, wasn't it?
[03:55:32.419 --> 03:55:33.380]  What else have we got here?
[03:55:33.420 --> 03:55:35.682]  We've got Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
[03:55:35.742 --> 03:55:39.785]  White nationalism, the most deadly form of terrorism in the United States.
[03:55:41.095 --> 03:55:56.909]  He conveniently hasn't included the 9-11 attack, the Pulse nightclub shooting, the San Bernardino shooting, the Boston Marathon bombing, or the shooting at a military base in Fort Hood, Texas, which claimed a total of 2,977 American lives.
[03:55:57.349 --> 03:56:06.677]  Conveniently left that out of his equation when he's, again, trying to tie into this hysteria over white nationalism being the biggest terrorist threat.
[03:56:09.102 --> 03:56:13.645]  Headline on Infowars, journalists triggered over fake news shorts sold by Forever 21.
[03:56:14.345 --> 03:56:20.769]  Corporate journalists are triggered over a $9.90 pair of boxer shorts and blazoned with the phrase fake news sold by Forever 21.
[03:56:20.829 --> 03:56:25.251]  They're literally saying that this is inciting violence against journalists.
[03:56:26.292 --> 03:56:30.714]  A local report with the Baltimore Sun publicly blasted Forever 21 for selling the shorts.
[03:56:31.255 --> 03:56:33.116]  Yet her tweet might actually sell more shorts.
[03:56:33.780 --> 03:56:37.203]  Since she's given the product more publicity than it likely had before.
[03:56:37.903 --> 03:56:41.586]  Maybe an idea for the Infowars store to get some fake news apparel.
[03:56:43.868 --> 03:56:48.992]  Another local journalist, a sports reporter, suggested the shorts expressed hatred for journalists.
[03:56:49.032 --> 03:56:56.217]  So now you can't even create a satirical item of clothing because journalists are going to get triggered by it.
[03:56:56.538 --> 03:56:58.119]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:57:00.009 --> 03:57:02.611]  Meanwhile, Trump calls Squad Nightmare for America.
[03:57:03.211 --> 03:57:12.556]  President Trump on Tuesday insisted he will add Minnesota to his win column in the 2020 presidential election because voters will side with him against the state's far-left Democratic Rep.
[03:57:12.656 --> 03:57:13.437]  Ilhan Omar.
[03:57:13.477 --> 03:57:16.378]  Of course, Trump nearly won Minnesota in 2016.
[03:57:17.379 --> 03:57:19.260]  Looked like he was going to win it for a long time.
[03:57:20.251 --> 03:57:26.294]  Now, his strategy of making the squad the face of the Democrats is working a treat.
[03:57:26.374 --> 03:57:45.522]  Of course, we had CNN come out and quote Democratic insiders who said, as I said last week, Trump had pulled off an absolute masterstroke by keeping the media focus on these four because their favorability ratings with Democratic swing voters are extremely low, in Ilhan Omar's case, as low as 9%.
[03:57:47.452 --> 03:57:48.573]  That's gonna wrap it up for the show.
[03:57:48.593 --> 03:57:50.114]  War Room with Owen Troy is coming up next.
[03:57:50.134 --> 03:57:51.956]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:02.506 --> 03:58:03.868]  Between the media and the people.
[03:58:04.328 --> 03:58:09.235]  The entire corporate, globalist, New World Order combine is about making you feel powerless.
[03:58:09.635 --> 03:58:16.284]  And the media telling you America sucks, God sucks, the family sucks, the Second Amendment sucks, freedom is terrible.
[03:58:16.724 --> 03:58:17.685]  It's making you feel alone.
[03:58:18.547 --> 03:58:19.628]  The truth is, you're not alone.
[03:58:20.248 --> 03:58:22.109]  Freedom worldwide is exploding.
[03:58:22.209 --> 03:58:23.630]  It doesn't matter what color your skin is.
[03:58:24.110 --> 03:58:25.311]  People want justice.
[03:58:25.851 --> 03:58:28.793]  So we have Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[03:58:29.634 --> 03:58:44.823]  And in the private messages to me, I'm going to start every day, six days a week when I do the regular radio TV show that reaches millions, to answer your questions, be they political, be they personal, any question goes as long as they're not a joke.
[03:58:45.303 --> 03:58:46.164]  Or maybe they are a joke.
[03:58:47.344 --> 03:58:52.170]  As long as they're serious in some way, I will answer your questions on air.
