[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:10.505]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:12.767]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:16.429]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:28.716]  It is Monday, the 21st day of March, 2011.
[00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:41.620]  We're going to be live here for at least the next three hours with some of the bravest information ever developing out of the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:50.564]  Also, the ongoing whitewash and cover-up unfolding in Japan, centering in and around the Fukushima 6 nuclear reactor complex.
[00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.478]  Also, it is in the news, U.S.
[00:00:54.618 --> 00:01:02.484]  Army kill team in Afghanistan posed for photos of, with murdered civilians, commanders braced for backlash of anti-U.S.
[00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:06.446]  sentiment that could be more damaging than Abu Ghraib's scandal.
[00:01:07.207 --> 00:01:07.887]  Will the U.N.
[00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:11.750]  call for invading the United States because their military is engaged in atrocities?
[00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.601]  Certainly not.
[00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:18.062]  But you are seeing and hearing that now coming out of North Africa.
[00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:22.644]  And I have the NBC headline here, Illinois National Guard heads to Libya.
[00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:31.966]  And of course there are two Marine Corps amphibious landing aircraft carriers off the coast.
[00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:38.088]  The bombardments, the hundreds of cruise missiles, the bombings, the attempted assassination of Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:40.329]  That's quite a no-fly zone.
[00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:52.253]  And lots of arrested development men feel very manly and feel powerful through the New World Order as they buy their 12 packs of beer and go home and watch the explosions.
[00:01:52.293 --> 00:02:06.138]  They are cheering and running around happily as the very same bankers taking over from a lower-level minion, a lower-level corrupt individual, a lower-level strongman, Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:10.020]  The very same banksters are robbing you at the same time.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.308]  And they'd love to drop cruise missiles on your head if they thought they could take over some living space, some territory in doing it.
[00:02:19.748 --> 00:02:21.129]  So that is all coming up.
[00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.731]  Here's the really bad news.
[00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:25.453]  And I began to cover this yesterday.
[00:02:26.414 --> 00:02:30.778]  The media is now in overdrive right now.
[00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.704]  The media is now in hyper overdrive, hyping attacks by Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:49.030]  So you go in and you attack Qaddafi, then you stage terror attacks that legitimize your full-bore invasion that's already building up the preparations for off their coast.
[00:02:50.976 --> 00:03:07.796]  And then it legitimizes your war and allows you to crack down on your real prey, the 300 million Americans who you're putting through slave training, dog training, of taking your shoes and belt off and your jacket off and having the government grab your genitals and then put you in a radiation baker.
[00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.153]  It will work quite nicely for them.
[00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:11.933]  U.S.
[00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:14.414]  eyes Qaddafi terror response.
[00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:17.856]  Of course, it's on record, and that was in my stack yesterday.
[00:03:17.876 --> 00:03:23.758]  Well, you guys pulled me the London Telegraph and the PrisonPlanet.com article about al-Qaeda leading the attack on Qaddafi.
[00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:31.462]  It's admitted that al-Qaeda, out of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are running the operation against Muammar Qaddafi.
[00:03:32.236 --> 00:03:34.658]  And so we're going to be going over that as well.
[00:03:35.058 --> 00:03:41.524]  Meanwhile, SAS smash squads are on the ground in Libya to mark targets for coalition jets.
[00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:43.105]  So the troops are on the ground.
[00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:59.659]  Of course, that's why the SAS went in weeks ago, as we told you, was to laze targets and to call in grid coordinates for cruise missiles, fighter bombers, and drones to drop their loving humanitarian payloads.
[00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.813]  on the populations.
[00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:09.067]  But hey, will our country, controlled by the globalists, now invade Syria?
[00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.127]  Wave of unrest shakes Syria.
[00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:14.990]  Crowds torch party headquarters.
[00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.376]  And you better believe that's the black op teams inside Syria implementing what they did two years ago trying to overthrow Iran.
[00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:22.957]  It's on!
[00:04:23.717 --> 00:04:23.837]  Oh!
[00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:26.079]  The Iranians are crushing people.
[00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:26.900]  Invade!
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.561]  The Syrians are crushing.
[00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:29.562]  Invade!
[00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:30.943]  Bombard!
[00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.703]  This is World War Three unfolding.
[00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:37.204]  World War Three in regions all over the Middle East, Central Asia.
[00:04:37.584 --> 00:04:38.905]  Bombardments, invasions.
[00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:40.766]  But it's humanitarian!
[00:04:42.687 --> 00:04:51.130]  And it's also a nice little distraction for the nuclear radiation fallout intensifying as it heads across the Pacific towards the United States' west coast.
[00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.411]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:54.512]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:55.832]  Infowars.com.

[00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.540]  We're subject to other police action.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.301]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:09.223]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.784]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.804 --> 00:05:17.267]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:23.910]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.874]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.314 --> 00:05:33.997]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:38.500]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.284]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:47.707]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:49.688]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:50.689]  It's here.

[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.964]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:19.069]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:23.277]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:27.486]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.102]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:41.362 --> 00:06:42.883]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:45.705]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:50.089]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:06:55.372 --> 00:06:56.793]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:56.953 --> 00:06:57.414]  Got it.
[00:06:57.734 --> 00:06:58.234]  Others don't.
[00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:03.930]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.851]  Number one.
[00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.293]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:09.154]  Number two.
[00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:13.998]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:14.778]  It's true.
[00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:19.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.942 --> 00:07:20.502]  Number three.
[00:07:20.763 --> 00:07:24.045]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:28.048]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:28.808]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.410]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.192]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:35.692]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.273 --> 00:07:40.195]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.435 --> 00:07:45.198]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:49.502]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:51.204]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:53.526]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:05.379]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.982]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:24.235]  Well, up at InfoWars.com, PrisonBlinded.com, as well as DrugsReport.com, you can see the civilians, including a young boy, tortured and murdered dead with U.S.
[00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:31.737]  kill teams posing like they've just bagged a 12-point whitetail deer on grandpa's back 40.
[00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:42.612]  Because in America now, being manly is about loving the image of countries being bombed, loving the image of death and skulls and annihilation.
[00:08:43.013 --> 00:08:44.553]  Don't worry U.S.
[00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:46.714]  military that are part of the kill teams.
[00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:48.394]  You think you're big and bad and evil?
[00:08:49.254 --> 00:08:52.715]  The big bankers that run you and use you to power their world government?
[00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:59.017]  Eleven years ago, they signed the deal with the insurance companies to steal all of your death benefits.
[00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:03.504]  Hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that you'd paid in.
[00:09:03.845 --> 00:09:05.626]  Don't worry, they're going to destroy your dollar.
[00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:08.388]  Don't worry, they're going to destroy your private property rights.
[00:09:08.788 --> 00:09:12.731]  Don't worry, they're passing laws to shut down small family farms and ranches.
[00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:15.793]  Don't worry, what comes around goes around.
[00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.114]  You think evil's cool?
[00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:20.017]  You think not having a rule of law is powerful?
[00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:28.122]  You think it's dark and mystic and chic and powerful and has majesty to be into?
[00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:34.506]  Remember what Private Gruckheimer in the Ithaca Times, now nine years ago,
[00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:37.864]  Came back from Afghanistan after his first tour.
[00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:43.026]  Told the paper, we go into villages, we kill men, women, and children, including toddlers.
[00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:49.869]  And the Pentagon came out a day later on Fox News and said, we want to clarify, we only kill everyone in certain villages.
[00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:54.511]  Yes, we walk up to newborn babies and shoot them with M16s.
[00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:59.993]  They go in and they take children and they line them up and they just shotgun them laughing.
[00:10:02.543 --> 00:10:14.365]  And the Army's own report from Abu Ghraib, where they take the children in front of their parents, and they get the battery acid, and they pour it into their orifices, and they engage in satanic death and evil.
[00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:16.445]  Oh, all in the name of America.
[00:10:16.505 --> 00:10:17.526]  And then the U.S.
[00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:23.707]  government releases the photos to further destroy America's name as part of the endgame.
[00:10:24.487 --> 00:10:30.968]  And America takes it hook, line, and sinker, like a big bass who's had a purple worm dropped down in front of him.
[00:10:32.227 --> 00:10:35.590]  There's a big Wall Street Journal article today about why do we let them dress that way.
[00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.651]  In fact, I forgot to print that.
[00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:37.472]  Print it for me.
[00:10:37.692 --> 00:10:41.996]  Why are 10, 11, 12-year-old girls now dressing as prostitutes as the new style?
[00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:48.622]  Because MTV, it came out five years ago, had a plan to do that, to sexualize the pre-teens, the tweenies.
[00:10:48.962 --> 00:10:51.084]  And parents buy into that death as well.
[00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:54.307]  It's all engineered for societal death.
[00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:56.489]  Because once they've got your morals,
[00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:06.439]  Once they've got you to become seduced by the dark side, you are weak, you are blind, you have no discernment, and you will fall.
[00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:22.553]  It is the Bill of Rights, it is the Constitution, it is the rule of law, it is all of those hedges of protection that protect the great jewel of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about must be protected at all costs.
[00:11:23.214 --> 00:11:40.610]  And that jewel of liberty has now been shattered and thrown into a million different pieces and now the shields are falling, evil and judgment is flowing in as radiation begins to bathe the United States and the media tells you it's actually good for you and Coulter and others.
[00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:51.118]  And as every blessing we had is sucked dry by the vampires, the psychic vampires of the New World Order.
[00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:59.808]  And you walk into the gas station, or you walk into the corner bar, and they've got the war on, not sports, and they're high-fiving every time a cruise missile hits.
[00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:00.829]  Woo-hoo!
[00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.230]  I actually heard it in the gas station Saturday.
[00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.950]  Woo-hoo!
[00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.051]  High-fiving!
[00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.911]  Man, the bankers can break international law.
[00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:10.552]  The UN can violate its own charter.
[00:12:10.892 --> 00:12:11.312]  Woo-hoo!
[00:12:11.372 --> 00:12:14.332]  They can try to assassinate some little petty dictator.
[00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:19.753]  Oh, they can send the special forces in with Al-Qaeda backing the whole operation.
[00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:25.414]  And everybody can celebrate and have a wonderful time and feel big and powerful.
[00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:29.515]  I want to show TV viewers a document cam shot, but for others, just go to the London Telegraph.
[00:12:30.765 --> 00:12:33.888]  The West and Al-Qaeda on the same side in Libya.
[00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:43.875]  Statements of support for Libya's revolution by Al-Qaeda and the leading Islamists have led to fears that military action by the West might be playing into the hands
[00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:46.251]  of its ideological enemies.
[00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:52.894]  Al Qaeda was created by the CIA and British SAS, along with Pakistani and Israeli intelligence on record.
[00:12:53.194 --> 00:12:54.995]  Brzezinski's written two books bragging about it.
[00:12:55.375 --> 00:13:02.397]  They were used as the pretext to invade the Serbs, the Muslim extremist attack out of Albania, led by Osama bin Laden on record.
[00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:03.838]  The U.S.
[00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:10.140]  and NATO bombed the power plants, the water plants, the factories for peaceful aircraft and cars.
[00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:14.042]  They blow Serbia into the Stone Age.
[00:13:14.903 --> 00:13:17.167]  They bomb all their major cities with DU.
[00:13:17.688 --> 00:13:24.698]  They roll in with Al Qaeda, and Al Qaeda began massive ethnic cleansing of the Serb Christians, and our media went, woo-hoo!
[00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.033]  And it was all done off of a hoax.
[00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:42.440]  All done off of a hoax of a UN facility with one guy that had hepatitis standing trying to get into the food facility and they said that was people in a camp when they were people looking in from the outside.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.602]  It turns out the British News asked the guy to take his shirt off.
[00:13:47.773 --> 00:13:50.335]  Just like Saddam had babies in incubators.
[00:13:50.735 --> 00:13:53.678]  When they were throwing the babies out of the incubators and clubbing their heads.
[00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:55.679]  Now admitted a total lie.
[00:13:55.979 --> 00:14:00.863]  Just like WMDs in Iraq.
[00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:03.045]  All lies.
[00:14:03.585 --> 00:14:04.406]  And here it is.
[00:14:05.007 --> 00:14:07.428]  Al Qaeda pouring in out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:14:07.448 --> 00:14:10.131]  Give me a document cam shot please.
[00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:13.833]  Libya being overrun by Al Qaeda.
[00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:16.556]  Look at that nice young man there with his ski mask on.
[00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:18.911]  Nice, nice person.
[00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:20.752]  Of course, here's our article that came out before theirs.
[00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:21.392]  U.S.
[00:14:21.432 --> 00:14:25.513]  government backs Libya and Al-Qaeda while hyping terror attacks inside the U.S.
[00:14:26.413 --> 00:14:29.374]  And that's the big news now in the New York Times today.
[00:14:29.834 --> 00:14:33.915]  Bracing for Qaddafi to hit us with terror.
[00:14:34.396 --> 00:14:35.576]  He might actually try it.
[00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:43.142]  But, more likely, the globalists will simply activate some sleeper cells of useful idiots or actual operatives.
[00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:48.625]  They'll blow some stuff up, and the TSA will say, see, we're putting you in the naked body scanners.
[00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:50.126]  We're setting up highway checkpoints.
[00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:53.587]  We've got all the local police trained for civil emergency.
[00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:56.069]  That's the code word, buzzword, for martial law.
[00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:57.389]  See, we told you.
[00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.410]  And then, oh, we've got to invade.
[00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.293]  How dare Qaddafi hit Chicago at the Sears Tower now owned by
[00:15:05.612 --> 00:15:06.573]  Larry Silverstein.
[00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:09.615]  How dare him hit LA!
[00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:11.897]  How dare him hit New York!
[00:15:11.937 --> 00:15:13.618]  How dare him hit Dallas!
[00:15:13.998 --> 00:15:25.167]  How dare him... Don't worry, the Marines just so happen to be off the coast in their giant amphibious attack systems that offload the hovercraft and the rest of it.
[00:15:25.527 --> 00:15:27.728]  They're ready to invade for America!
[00:15:27.808 --> 00:15:29.029]  Team America!
[00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.110]  Oh yeah!
[00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:33.433]  We're gonna get those guys.
[00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:40.259]  Meanwhile, Qaddafi defeated the Al Qaeda, Egyptian, Saudi Arabian backed forces, but it doesn't matter.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.343]  We're bracing right now for Qaddafi.
[00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:47.930]  Everybody's hearing on the news that dirty rat's gonna try to hit us with an Al Qaeda.
[00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.093]  Meanwhile, Al Qaeda works for the globalists.
[00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:52.519]  They get to take over countries.
[00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:53.339]  They launch them on.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.281]  They start wars with the Russians with them.
[00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:57.983]  In 1979, they start wars.
[00:15:58.283 --> 00:15:59.624]  You're not told about it until 83.
[00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:01.725]  They start wars with the Serbs with them.
[00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:05.568]  And if you defend yourself, it doesn't mean the Serbs were angels.
[00:16:05.588 --> 00:16:07.149]  It doesn't mean Gaddafi's a good guy.
[00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:10.051]  The point is, it's part of a larger operation.
[00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:12.893]  And people are given this false moral reason.
[00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:15.174]  But then, meanwhile, U.S.
[00:16:15.354 --> 00:16:19.477]  Army kill teams posing with the dead women and children.
[00:16:19.517 --> 00:16:21.078]  It's so manly.
[00:16:22.718 --> 00:16:25.499]  It's not a sad thing when you accidentally kill a kid.
[00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:26.820]  No, it's something to be proud of.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.260]  In fact, you kill them on purpose.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:39.083]  And then you pose with the dead little boy, their bloody body, lifting the head up, smiling there with that dead corpse in civilian clothes.
[00:16:39.963 --> 00:16:44.504]  Just like Private Gruckheimer said, we go into villages and we kill the babies.
[00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:45.845]  We kill the women.
[00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:48.806]  And the Army comes out, the Pentagon comes out on Fox News, 2002.
[00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:54.523]  And says, well, only in certain villages.
[00:16:55.604 --> 00:16:57.647]  And those guys are all coming back to be cops!
[00:16:58.408 --> 00:16:59.690]  And TSA workers!
[00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:02.633]  An army of darkness, an army of hell!
[00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:06.418]  And don't worry, it's now come out in federal court.
[00:17:06.478 --> 00:17:07.980]  Blackwater in Iraq.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.061]  Huge Koch parties.
[00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:10.643]  Men running around naked together.
[00:17:10.943 --> 00:17:14.386]  Running around naked outside in major downtown areas.
[00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.350]  Firing into homes, into cars, and just orgies of bloodletting.
[00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:20.512]  The Iraqis reported it at the time.
[00:17:20.552 --> 00:17:21.814]  They said, who are these people?
[00:17:22.114 --> 00:17:23.455]  Is this the army of Satan?
[00:17:23.756 --> 00:17:25.758]  And yes, it is the army of Satan.
[00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:56.504]  America, the biggest user of drugs, the biggest user of porn, the biggest divorce rate, everything degenerating into pure evil and everyone just loving it and worshipping it and worshipping the football and the sports and the dirtier the comedy, the better, just debasing everything so we can be turned into servile, mindless, gibbering, atomized animals who can't defend each other, who don't have rudders, who don't have compasses, intellectually or morally or spiritually.
[00:17:56.724 --> 00:18:03.893]  Who can't communicate, who won't stand up for each other, who laugh at videos of cops beating people to death, or shooting citizens in the back.
[00:18:04.173 --> 00:18:10.020]  Total judgment being prepared to be poured out as America begs to be destroyed.
[00:18:11.022 --> 00:18:13.825]  And don't worry, the bankers know how to deliver judgment.
[00:18:14.686 --> 00:18:15.928]  God always delivers.
[00:18:17.369 --> 00:18:20.550]  His people into the hands of the wicked as judgment.
[00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:21.710]  You want judgment?
[00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.771]  You think evil, sexy and cool?
[00:18:24.351 --> 00:18:27.492]  We are going to get what the Iraqis got tenfold in different ways.
[00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:31.313]  The radiation, the fluoride in the water, the poison, the deadly vaccines.
[00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:42.236]  You think the global is pouring out death and dropping fire on men, women and children's heads and lining children up to murder them and UN troops in every country caught murdering and raping children.
[00:18:42.276 --> 00:18:43.476]  It constantly comes out in the news.
[00:18:43.776 --> 00:18:45.177]  You think these armies of hell
[00:18:46.357 --> 00:18:47.157]  Are they going to stop?
[00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:47.577]  No.
[00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:52.959]  They're abused, breathing DU, running around demonically, enjoying their own destruction.
[00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:56.340]  It's a spirit of trampling and being trampled upon.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:03.002]  A servile spirit of weakness and defeat and the dull, burning eyes of evil.
[00:19:04.707 --> 00:19:05.728]  That's what you want.
[00:19:06.128 --> 00:19:07.068]  That's what you get.
[00:19:07.809 --> 00:19:08.629]  This is what you want.
[00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:09.750]  This is what you get.
[00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.970]  This is what you want.
[00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:12.371]  Depression.
[00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:13.411]  Pain.
[00:19:14.032 --> 00:19:14.592]  Suffering.
[00:19:14.912 --> 00:19:15.953]  Cancer rates up by 3000%.
[00:19:15.993 --> 00:19:17.954]  Diabetes up by over 1000% and growing.
[00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:23.656]  Juvenile onset of brain disorders.
[00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.316]  People getting Alzheimer's when they're 30.
[00:19:26.017 --> 00:19:28.057]  Your neighbors dying to your left and right.
[00:19:28.137 --> 00:19:29.297]  Disease spreading.
[00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:30.898]  Allergens in the food.
[00:19:31.238 --> 00:19:32.018]  GMO.
[00:19:32.198 --> 00:19:32.518]  Death.
[00:19:32.598 --> 00:19:33.359]  Destruction.
[00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:33.959]  Pain.
[00:19:34.099 --> 00:19:34.619]  Judgment.
[00:19:34.859 --> 00:19:35.319]  War.
[00:19:35.499 --> 00:19:35.959]  Fire.
[00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:36.519]  Stench.
[00:19:36.879 --> 00:19:37.740]  Rotten bodies.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.340]  You want it, you got it.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.761]  What Hitler gave you, you're gonna get it.
[00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:44.256]  What Stalin gave you, you're gonna get it.
[00:19:44.596 --> 00:19:46.178]  What Mao gave you, you're gonna get it.
[00:19:46.258 --> 00:19:48.360]  You want it, they're gonna give it to you.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.202]  You love laying down to corruption.
[00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:51.403]  You love giggling about it.
[00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:52.844]  You love thinking it's funny.
[00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:53.905]  You love deception.
[00:19:54.106 --> 00:19:55.267]  You love being deceived.
[00:19:55.307 --> 00:19:57.048]  They've got greater deceptions for you.
[00:19:57.349 --> 00:19:58.990]  They've got greater scams for you.
[00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:23.419]  Due to the extreme conditions from the Japanese earthquake and the fallout of depleted uranium, HempUSA.org recommends new important products that are loaded with iodine, micro plant powder, green life kelp powder, raw unprocessed red palm oil, and our 10% roll-on clear iodine that heals the skin and naturally puts iodine back into your entire body.

[00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:39.027]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.087 --> 00:20:39.828]  This capitalism?
[00:20:39.888 --> 00:20:46.032]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.152 --> 00:20:46.932]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:46.953 --> 00:20:50.055]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:51.035]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.055 --> 00:20:52.096]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:52.376]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.436 --> 00:20:52.776]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.242 --> 00:21:02.024]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:03.506]  That little girl will get fed.
[00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:04.207]  For now.
[00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:07.391]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[00:21:07.771 --> 00:21:08.292]  If the U.S.
[00:21:08.312 --> 00:21:13.398]  dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:16.142]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:27.206]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil, continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.

[00:21:44.713 --> 00:21:49.980]  For a fraction of what you now pay at the grocery store, you owe it to your family to find out more from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:52.664]  Call today for their free full-color catalog at 1-800-453-2202.

[00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.146]  America, you've been warned.
[00:22:08.987 --> 00:22:12.028]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:22:12.368 --> 00:22:15.808]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:16.489]  Have you?
[00:22:16.849 --> 00:22:27.931]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:22:28.151 --> 00:22:29.171]  Could this really happen?
[00:22:29.331 --> 00:22:32.992]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:22:33.332 --> 00:22:38.353]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owners.
[00:22:38.433 --> 00:22:38.873]  We're good.
[00:23:00.231 --> 00:23:02.212]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:02.813 --> 00:23:03.333]  No kidding!
[00:23:03.493 --> 00:23:07.515]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.

[00:23:42.732 --> 00:23:43.672]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:09.087 --> 00:24:16.677]  Do you realize how deadly dangerous it is when shows like 24 in the last eight years glorified torture?
[00:24:18.439 --> 00:24:19.581]  When the media pushed it?
[00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:21.563]  When Rumsfeld talked about how great it was?
[00:24:23.105 --> 00:24:25.468]  When Bush wrote a book last year bragging about it?
[00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:31.655]  They are selling you on evil so that you will accept being part of an evil empire.
[00:24:32.276 --> 00:24:36.697]  And so you will accept your neighbors being abused and yourself being abused.
[00:24:36.757 --> 00:24:43.560]  They are destroying every basic protection against oppression and slavery.
[00:24:43.961 --> 00:24:47.602]  Things are serious, focused, hardcore.
[00:24:48.082 --> 00:24:49.843]  Forefathers understood.
[00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:51.164]  They'd been through oppression.
[00:24:51.464 --> 00:24:53.625]  They'd been through a war against the greatest empire.
[00:24:55.899 --> 00:24:56.979]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.840]  It's so sad how far we've slumped.
[00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:16.188]  The lies about how this is humanitarian, about how Qaddafi was going up against peaceful crowds, when on record it was NATO, British, French, U.S.-backed special forces in there commanding al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
[00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:17.768]  Not even debated!
[00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:18.949]  And now
[00:25:21.271 --> 00:25:27.698]  I mean, there's Al-Qaeda, who was used against the Serbs, used against the Russians, being used again, and the public doesn't even put two and two together.
[00:25:27.999 --> 00:25:31.423]  It's in mainstream news, CNN, London Telegraph.
[00:25:31.983 --> 00:25:32.885]  As a footnote,
[00:25:34.056 --> 00:25:47.584]  Going back four years ago, and then again two years ago, the White House put out public statements saying they were using four rebel groups on the eastern border of Iraq with Persia, with Iran, to launch attacks in the country, and that U.S.
[00:25:47.604 --> 00:25:49.446]  Special Forces were on the ground in Iran.
[00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:51.227]  Acts of war!
[00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:55.770]  Telling us that Iran's gonna launch terror attacks on us.
[00:25:56.291 --> 00:25:57.473]  This isn't our government.
[00:25:57.773 --> 00:25:59.095]  This isn't our military.
[00:25:59.416 --> 00:26:01.779]  Your son or daughter may be in the military, may be a great person.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.285]  It'd be like a nice person who was German in the German military in 1940.
[00:26:06.883 --> 00:26:07.223]  Okay?
[00:26:07.523 --> 00:26:09.164]  The country is run by crooks.
[00:26:09.624 --> 00:26:10.985]  It's not America doing this.
[00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:13.046]  And we better hit our knees and repent.
[00:26:13.386 --> 00:26:16.767]  And also publicly say, not in our name, what's going on.
[00:26:17.107 --> 00:26:19.128]  Yeah, Qaddafi's been in power for 41 years.
[00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:20.569]  He looks like a goofball.
[00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:24.270]  But he's a strong man who's handed out millions of guns to his people.
[00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.911]  He's preparing for invasion.
[00:26:26.111 --> 00:26:27.652]  They've clearly got an invasion set.
[00:26:27.912 --> 00:26:30.553]  There's special forces there, admittedly, for over a month.
[00:26:32.349 --> 00:26:47.113]  The invasion forces are off the coast and the way they're acting is they may stage a terror attack and blame it on Qaddafi and then legitimize a crackdown domestically and more police state as we go into the depression.
[00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:50.213]  What did Rand Corporation say three years ago that Paul Watson wrote about?
[00:26:50.914 --> 00:26:51.974]  Made big national news.
[00:26:53.694 --> 00:26:56.435]  Because we're some of the only people that'll actually read government reports and write about it.
[00:26:57.213 --> 00:27:02.116]  Rand Corporation said the next few years to get out of the depression we need a large war bigger than Iraq.
[00:27:02.196 --> 00:27:04.017]  A full regional war.
[00:27:05.278 --> 00:27:05.918]  How do they do it?
[00:27:06.598 --> 00:27:10.861]  They fund radical groups who sure I'm sure have beefs with the government.
[00:27:10.941 --> 00:27:12.062]  These are corrupt Arab governments.
[00:27:12.102 --> 00:27:13.302]  Every one of them a dictatorship.
[00:27:14.003 --> 00:27:16.244]  Either whether it's run by royalty or an oligarchy.
[00:27:17.165 --> 00:27:23.728]  And they fund them in Saudi Arabia, in Bahrain, in Egypt, in Libya, in Jordan.
[00:27:25.169 --> 00:27:26.130]  Friends and enemies.
[00:27:27.837 --> 00:27:32.438]  And by the way, the Bahrainian government, big allies with the West, are now saying it's a Western plot.
[00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:34.439]  Well, of course it's a Western plot!
[00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:36.459]  They want that whole place on fire.
[00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:42.941]  They want to put radicals in, because then the globalists can invade and clean out the radicals in each country and fully take it over.
[00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:48.642]  And then roll in with the sterilants, the vaccines, the fluoride, the water, the GMO crops like they've done in Iraq.
[00:27:50.023 --> 00:27:51.763]  And give them the same death they're giving us.
[00:27:52.063 --> 00:27:55.644]  They want a captured group where they can brainwash them with Western media.
[00:27:57.588 --> 00:28:02.293]  BBC and the US government just merged as a way to launch propaganda internationally.
[00:28:02.453 --> 00:28:03.495]  They were already merged.
[00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:04.636]  Google.
[00:28:05.256 --> 00:28:07.879]  The head of Google now, they're saying, is going to be the head of the Commerce Department.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.981]  It's all government.
[00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:15.127]  You read SPP, North American Union, internal documents that Judicial Watch student got four years ago?
[00:28:15.888 --> 00:28:25.618]  At those meetings, the Fortune 100 order the presidents and the Secretary of States and the heads of the energy and commerce departments of every major nation.
[00:28:25.658 --> 00:28:27.820]  They tell them, do this, and they ratify it.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.762]  They take direct orders.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.401]  The liberals are like, good, tax the corporations and give it to the people.
[00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:38.102]  That just goes to the government and goes to the offshore corporations.
[00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:40.523]  These corporations are government.
[00:28:40.883 --> 00:28:42.023]  They are the government.
[00:28:42.343 --> 00:28:44.764]  The illegitimate, stinking corporate government.
[00:28:45.264 --> 00:28:54.147]  Two hundred years ago, the British East India Company was a private government running India and countless other possessions across the Pacific.
[00:28:55.868 --> 00:28:59.369]  It's the British East India, Dutch East India Company model.
[00:29:00.293 --> 00:29:01.914]  Okay, that's what globalism is.
[00:29:02.414 --> 00:29:04.234]  That's what the New World Order is.
[00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:06.095]  Here it is.
[00:29:06.235 --> 00:29:07.876]  Wave of unrest shakes Syria.
[00:29:07.936 --> 00:29:09.656]  Crowds torch Party HQ.
[00:29:09.716 --> 00:29:13.697]  Definitely special force-led, just like it was a month ago in Libya.
[00:29:13.937 --> 00:29:15.718]  Are we going to now have our government tell us?
[00:29:16.038 --> 00:29:17.859]  Our corporate government we've got to invade?
[00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:21.760]  You notice the ceremonial Congress wasn't even involved in this.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.901]  The corporate UN, set up by the Rockefellers, ordered it last Thursday.
[00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:26.862]  It happened in 48 hours.
[00:29:28.732 --> 00:29:36.238]  Will the corporate UN, prancing around posing as liberals, running genocide, will they now call for an invasion of Syria?
[00:29:36.478 --> 00:29:37.599]  What about Bahrain?
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.061]  CNBC!
[00:29:40.081 --> 00:29:41.882]  I know good ol' boys are like, good, kill them.
[00:29:41.902 --> 00:29:43.463]  Bahrain's our allies, Dumbo.
[00:29:44.204 --> 00:29:47.106]  Bahrain King says forces have foiled foreign plot.
[00:29:47.386 --> 00:29:48.107]  It's all coming up.
[00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:51.409]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.491]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.432 --> 00:29:57.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.832]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:53.406]  Thank you!
[00:31:01.115 --> 00:31:04.739]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.139 --> 00:31:08.163]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:08.383 --> 00:31:13.168]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.188 --> 00:31:19.435]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:19.575 --> 00:31:21.818]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:22.358 --> 00:31:23.939]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:23.959 --> 00:31:25.099]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:27.360]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:41.246 --> 00:31:48.148]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:48.528 --> 00:31:57.631]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:00.996 --> 00:32:07.679]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.261]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:19.505]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:32:19.746 --> 00:32:26.349]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:28.831]  We're good.
[00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:46.738]  800-409-5633.
[00:32:46.778 --> 00:32:48.238]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:49.379]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:32:49.399 --> 00:32:50.479]  You take em all to man.
[00:32:50.499 --> 00:32:51.660]  And put em in control.
[00:33:35.934 --> 00:33:40.896]  What have we told you in the last few years that the globalist stratagem was?
[00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:54.141]  That as they build towards the world meltdown of financial markets by design and the public birth of private corporate world government issuing the new global currency, the SDR.
[00:33:57.051 --> 00:33:59.652]  What have we broken down that they would do?
[00:34:00.752 --> 00:34:08.835]  What did Webster Tarpley say the Brzezinski model was?
[00:34:09.115 --> 00:34:11.416]  He's written countless white papers, books.
[00:34:11.476 --> 00:34:12.697]  He's told us what he would do.
[00:34:13.037 --> 00:34:15.778]  He's running foreign affairs for Obama for behind the scenes.
[00:34:17.058 --> 00:34:18.219]  Destabilization.
[00:34:19.093 --> 00:34:30.398]  Wars, breaking countries up, financing rebels, and then when the rebels fail, you move in behind them in the name of dealing with a humanitarian crisis.
[00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:31.878]  We have called this 100%.
[00:34:33.439 --> 00:34:34.719]  What did I say a few weeks ago?
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:46.164]  That they would attack Qaddafi, that that was coming, and then they would stage terror attacks and say that Qaddafi had done it as a pretext to launch a full-bore ground invasion.
[00:34:47.423 --> 00:34:58.632]  Of the entire Middle East, every quote, enemy, rogue nation, but also go after the globalist big enemy, the Western populations that are their milk cows that they're bleeding dry.
[00:35:00.393 --> 00:35:12.803]  And now the New York Times says USI's Qaddafi terror response, US intelligence agencies are watching for signs that desperate Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, under attack from a coalition air assault, could resort to acts of terrorism against Western targets.
[00:35:14.537 --> 00:35:15.597]  See how perfect this is?
[00:35:15.997 --> 00:35:17.758]  And then if he fights back, it's called terror.
[00:35:18.138 --> 00:35:20.119]  Or even if he doesn't, they'll stage something.
[00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:28.901]  The globalists for years, at least five they admit, have been trying to get the Iranians by attacking them internally through terror groups to respond.
[00:35:30.241 --> 00:35:31.242]  This is very sinister.
[00:35:31.882 --> 00:35:32.142]  U.S.
[00:35:32.182 --> 00:35:34.603]  officials are keeping an eye on that possibility, one U.S.
[00:35:35.023 --> 00:35:35.983]  official said.
[00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:46.968]  Colonel Gaddafi has extensive stockpiles of mustard gas, high explosive, at his disposal that could be used in attacks against targets in Europe or against his own people.
[00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:52.295]  He has also a documented history of orchestrating strikes against civilians and other world leaders.
[00:35:52.315 --> 00:35:53.957]  Alright, now...
[00:35:55.879 --> 00:35:59.722]  Here's the most important point that people need to be made aware of.
[00:36:00.222 --> 00:36:09.908]  What is the Western ally, Bahrain, saying that just defeated with Saudi Arabian troops massive uprisings nationwide, many of them violent?
[00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:13.191]  Bahrain King says forces have foiled foreign plot.
[00:36:14.151 --> 00:36:15.372]  Oh, who do you think was behind it?
[00:36:15.972 --> 00:36:30.099]  Bahrain's King, Hamed bin Issa Al Khalifa, said a foreign plot against his kingdom had been foiled and thanked troops brought in from neighboring countries to help end increasing unrest after weeks of protest.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.782]  But again, when he shoots peaceful protesters, it's loving and good in our media.
[00:36:35.822 --> 00:36:36.583]  At least for now.
[00:36:36.883 --> 00:36:38.764]  Will they call for an invasion of Bahrain?
[00:36:40.216 --> 00:36:44.780]  They didn't call for an invasion of China after Tiananmen Square or the ongoing stuff in the last 20 years.
[00:36:46.182 --> 00:36:53.889]  The King told forces that if such a plot had succeeded in one Gulf country, it could spill into neighboring states.
[00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:56.452]  Well, of course, that's the plan.
[00:36:57.796 --> 00:37:13.933]  The ferocity of the crackdown last week by Iranian forces, aided by the entrance of troops from the Sunni-ruled Gulf countries, stunned Bahrain's majority Shiites, the main force of protest, and angered the region's non-Arab Shiite power, Iran.
[00:37:13.953 --> 00:37:16.575]  So they're claiming, they're trying to imply Iran's the power.
[00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:28.001]  Iran, which supports Shiite groups in Iraq and Lebanon, has complained to the United Nations and asked neighbors to join in urging Saudi Arabia to withdraw forces from Bahrain.
[00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:34.868]  Now, what's going on to the west of there, in Syria, north of Israel?
[00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:37.050]  Wave of unrest shakes Syria.
[00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.052]  Crowds torch headquarters.
[00:37:40.247 --> 00:37:47.829]  Crowds set fire to headquarters of the ruling Ba'ath party in Syria in the city of Daraa on Sunday.
[00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:53.070]  Residents said as a wave of unrest in the Arab world shook even one of the most authoritarian states.
[00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:58.452]  The demonstrators also set ablaze the main court complex and two phone company branches.
[00:37:59.032 --> 00:38:00.272]  Yeah, they know exactly what to hit.
[00:38:00.312 --> 00:38:01.352]  Special force commanded.
[00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:07.614]  One of the firms is owned by the president, Assad's cousin.
[00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.533]  They burned the symbols of oppression and corruption, an activist said.
[00:38:11.813 --> 00:38:13.275]  The banks nearby were torched.
[00:38:13.615 --> 00:38:28.089]  So you've got all these dictatorships run by independent dictators or run by Western-backed dictators, and when the Western-backed dictators kill people and shoot them, it's loving, good, helpful, pro-America, but when it's Libya or when it is
[00:38:34.075 --> 00:38:36.317]  Syria, it's horrible and we've got to invade.
[00:38:36.697 --> 00:38:40.200]  When I say we, again that's my own brainwashing from the globalists.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.502]  It's not our government, it's not our military.
[00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:46.905]  Get that through your heads as we go bankrupt.
[00:38:47.666 --> 00:38:53.110]  And remember all those Obama memos, all those White House advisers saying we need a new 9-11.
[00:38:53.210 --> 00:39:01.577]  We need a new Oklahoma City to blame on domestic groups and a 9-11 to blame on foreign groups to keep the wars going and to make Obama's approval rating go up.
[00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:03.739]  We need these events.
[00:39:04.579 --> 00:39:05.981]  Remember the Giffords shooting.
[00:39:06.301 --> 00:39:08.403]  Within hours they were blaming it on talk radio.
[00:39:08.683 --> 00:39:11.866]  Ron Paul, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin.
[00:39:13.007 --> 00:39:15.409]  As the internet kill switch goes into place.
[00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:17.370]  All of this happening now.
[00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:21.214]  All of this unfolding.
[00:39:23.274 --> 00:39:36.658]  With British and other Western Special Forces on the ground, marking and lazing targets of the ongoing bombardment, with Qaddafi handing out over a million weapons to over a million citizens, preparing for the ground assault.
[00:39:38.278 --> 00:39:45.340]  And the globalists are happy to just split off the eastern part of the country, encircle Qaddafi, and then launch more guerrilla attacks over the years.
[00:39:48.322 --> 00:39:50.644]  But they may actually stage a terror attack.
[00:39:50.704 --> 00:39:56.789]  Remember in the few months before 9-11, even the Time Magazine and Newsweek reported on this the week after 9-11.
[00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:57.449]  Oh!
[00:39:57.469 --> 00:40:03.914]  44,000 US troops, 18,000 British troops, several aircraft carrier groups, the aircraft
[00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:12.134]  at land bases as well, all got ready and Bush signed the order to attack Afghanistan on September 10th.
[00:40:12.154 --> 00:40:17.017]  In fact, guys, search the term Bush signed order to attack Afghanistan on September 10th.
[00:40:17.338 --> 00:40:18.558]  The first link will be Newsweek.
[00:40:18.578 --> 00:40:20.379]  I want to put that on screen for folks from 2001.
[00:40:20.419 --> 00:40:22.181]  They won't believe it unless they see it.
[00:40:22.201 --> 00:40:23.421]  A lot of them won't even search it.
[00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:24.282]  They'll just won't believe it.
[00:40:25.532 --> 00:40:29.054]  So, you got all the troops already built up in the name of dealing with Egypt.
[00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:33.896]  You've got the amphibious ships that just arrived this week, dispatched three weeks ago.
[00:40:34.276 --> 00:40:42.120]  The amphibious Marine Corps ships, these big stub aircraft carriers, sitting there waiting to disgorge Marines.
[00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:46.243]  You've got Illinois National Guard being dispatched to the region.
[00:40:46.283 --> 00:40:48.704]  Headline, Illinois Guard heads to Libya.
[00:40:49.909 --> 00:40:54.351]  An Air National Guard unit out of Illinois is heading to Libya to help fight against Colonel Qaddafi.
[00:40:55.031 --> 00:40:56.212]  I am proud of the National Guard.
[00:40:56.252 --> 00:40:56.892]  That means U.S.
[00:40:56.932 --> 00:40:59.173]  aircraft in the air, launching bombing attacks.
[00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:16.401]  I am proud the National Guard is able to play a part in curbing the atrocious violence against Libyan civilians by their own government, said Major General William Inrant, the Adjunct General of the Illinois National Guard, in a statement.
[00:41:18.453 --> 00:41:18.933]  Oh really?
[00:41:19.294 --> 00:41:21.495]  Is a foreign government going to invade the U.S.?
[00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:22.876]  Headline, U.S.
[00:41:23.036 --> 00:41:24.337]  Army Kill Team.
[00:41:25.038 --> 00:41:30.542]  It's turned out that was lies about Qaddafi shooting innocent civilians that weren't attacking, not defending the guy.
[00:41:30.562 --> 00:41:31.222]  It's just a fact.
[00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:34.685]  It turns out he didn't run to Venezuela.
[00:41:34.985 --> 00:41:39.528]  He didn't run to Zimbabwe.
[00:41:39.608 --> 00:41:40.749]  It's just all lies.
[00:41:43.775 --> 00:41:44.035]  U.S.
[00:41:44.095 --> 00:41:49.139]  Army kill team in Afghanistan posed for photos of murdered civilians, including children.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.822]  Commanders brace for backlash of anti-U.S.
[00:41:52.862 --> 00:41:55.985]  sentiment that could be more damaging than Abu Ghraib's scandal.
[00:41:56.005 --> 00:41:59.387]  Commanders in Afghanistan are bracing themselves, and they've now released the photos.
[00:42:00.668 --> 00:42:01.809]  We'll put it back on screen.
[00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:05.492]  Looks like about a 12-year-old in civilian clothes, dead, with a U.S.
[00:42:05.532 --> 00:42:07.734]  troop feeling really manly right now.
[00:42:08.475 --> 00:42:09.996]  I mean, he shot him, and it's fun.
[00:42:12.256 --> 00:42:20.479]  Senior officials at NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Kabul have compared the pictures published by German Newsweek leader Spiegel to the images of U.S.
[00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:24.201]  soldiers abusing prisoners in Abu Ghraib in Iraq, which sparked waves of anti-U.S.
[00:42:24.221 --> 00:42:24.641]  protests.
[00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:27.002]  Notice it was time to pull out of Afghanistan.
[00:42:27.602 --> 00:42:30.463]  It's like it was time to pull out of Iraq in 2005.
[00:42:31.384 --> 00:42:34.025]  And so they release the Abu Ghraib photos.
[00:42:34.445 --> 00:42:35.645]  They want the rebellion.
[00:42:36.386 --> 00:42:37.866]  British SAS was caught in 2006.
[00:42:39.963 --> 00:42:48.610]  London Guardian, Associated Press, dressed up like Sunnis shooting and killing Shiites in Basra, Iraq.
[00:42:51.372 --> 00:42:54.074]  This is a multi-trillion dollar operation for the bankers.
[00:42:54.654 --> 00:42:56.136]  They create the entire war.
[00:42:56.416 --> 00:43:03.722]  They fund the terrorists, they fund the criminal groups, they fund attacks that's come out on our own troops by mercenaries.
[00:43:03.982 --> 00:43:05.283]  You gotta have some kill numbers.
[00:43:08.203 --> 00:43:11.025]  They know the troops are going to have a delayed death from the DU.
[00:43:12.186 --> 00:43:20.832]  This is full-spectrum war against everyone by the globalists, playing different tribes, different religions, different groups off against each other.
[00:43:21.232 --> 00:43:24.735]  Full-spectrum dominance.
[00:43:26.336 --> 00:43:27.737]  Get into the mind of the globalists.
[00:43:28.818 --> 00:43:31.620]  Understand, oh, but the armies apologized, so it's okay.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.943]  Does that mean Qaddafi can apologize and the invasion won't have to happen?
[00:43:38.325 --> 00:43:42.607]  And remember, they lied and said there was no Western involvement in the rebels a month ago in Libya.
[00:43:42.627 --> 00:43:51.132]  Now it turns out the whole thing was run by the West, just like the whole thing against Mubarak was run, because it turns out he didn't want to go along with the Libya attack, the Iran attack.
[00:43:53.093 --> 00:43:54.093]  Are you guys calling Tarpley?
[00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:58.055]  He's good for 130.
[00:43:58.576 --> 00:43:59.136]  Excellent job.
[00:43:59.176 --> 00:44:00.156]  I forgot to tell you I want him.
[00:44:00.276 --> 00:44:00.697]  Good job.
[00:44:01.657 --> 00:44:03.598]  Tarpley absolutely called this in 2008.
[00:44:06.218 --> 00:44:07.518]  Eight during the campaign.
[00:44:07.558 --> 00:44:08.959]  He said Obama is going to win.
[00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:10.880]  This is exactly what's going to happen.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.061]  They're going to fund destabilization groups in all the Arab countries.
[00:44:14.641 --> 00:44:19.002]  And then there's going to be a giant destabilization and a huge war that could lead to World War III.
[00:44:22.844 --> 00:44:23.904]  And exactly what he said happened.
[00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:28.851]  We even, in Obama deception, show the maps and how they would do it.
[00:44:29.191 --> 00:44:44.017]  Of course, Tarpley, we could give him credit, but, and he does deserve it, because he actually read what Brzezinski said, what the Israelis in the 80s talked about, a plan to destabilize all the Arab countries, including allies, and overthrow them, and then have a war with the Al-Qaeda they put in!
[00:44:45.103 --> 00:44:47.724]  That'll make some money for the defense contractors.
[00:44:48.404 --> 00:44:59.066]  These guys, I remember two, three years ago, it was coming out about Blackwater murdering people for fun and the drugs and the armaments and the reports of staging events as a pretext for the West to stay in those countries.
[00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:06.647]  People would send me emails or I even ran into family who were like, Blackwater's pro-America doing what the army can't do.
[00:45:09.048 --> 00:45:10.228]  Family I have in the military.
[00:45:11.068 --> 00:45:13.669]  And now it turns out all of it was true.
[00:45:14.744 --> 00:45:18.328]  And they've moved to the Middle East, where they can't be extradited.
[00:45:19.229 --> 00:45:23.393]  And I remember three months ago, all these reports about why is Blackwater moving into North Africa?
[00:45:23.713 --> 00:45:31.140]  Why have they signed a deal with a mercenary group even bigger than them out of South Africa that's so secret, details aren't even known about them.
[00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:32.682]  Super hardcore mercs.
[00:45:34.544 --> 00:45:37.367]  Because they knew about the new bonus time coming.
[00:45:38.288 --> 00:45:46.550]  You better believe there's Merck forces, not just SAS and other regular military out of England, are all over Libya right now.
[00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:53.632]  And they got their rear end handed to them by Muammar Gaddafi, who's actually a military guy.
[00:45:54.652 --> 00:45:56.332]  He's a bold scrapper, folks.
[00:45:56.993 --> 00:45:58.873]  He took over when he was 20-something years old.
[00:45:59.493 --> 00:46:00.833]  What was he, 27 when he took over?
[00:46:02.214 --> 00:46:03.174]  Overthrew a monarchy?
[00:46:05.555 --> 00:46:06.875]  And he says, I'm going down.
[00:46:08.148 --> 00:46:10.089]  He says, I'm going down, I will die here.
[00:46:10.329 --> 00:46:12.190]  And he said, it's lies, I haven't left Tripoli.
[00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.771]  Remember a month ago, and then two weeks ago?
[00:46:14.452 --> 00:46:16.853]  They always keep lying to kind of bolster the rebel forces.
[00:46:17.013 --> 00:46:18.374]  Qaddafi's fled, we've won!
[00:46:18.914 --> 00:46:21.896]  To try to create a mass panic, and he said, I haven't left, I will die here.
[00:46:22.276 --> 00:46:22.696]  Bring it.
[00:46:24.477 --> 00:46:24.897]  Bring it.
[00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:29.320]  Well, the globalists have brought it.
[00:46:32.534 --> 00:46:35.879]  And this is what he said to Obama in a statement today.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:42.930]  To my dear Obama, our son, saying he's the son of Africa, says Qaddafi, defending attacks on rebels.
[00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.315]  No, he's the son of JPMorgan, Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:46.375 --> 00:46:47.256]  Go get that straight, Qaddafi.
[00:46:48.322 --> 00:46:53.085]  To my dear son, our son, says Gaddafi, defending attacks on rebels.
[00:46:53.766 --> 00:46:58.089]  He went on to say, if you were having uprisings against your capital, what would you do in America?
[00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.529]  Well, we know.
[00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:03.252]  Even if they were legitimate, they would mow down citizens and it would be hailed as a wonderful act.
[00:47:03.613 --> 00:47:10.938]  The feds would then set off truck bombs outside public schools to target children and blame the groups they'd mowed down for bombing the children.
[00:47:11.178 --> 00:47:12.099]  That's an easy equation.
[00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:18.710]  If the globalists have to mow Americans down, they will simultaneously detonate weapons, blaming it on domestic groups.
[00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:22.657]  They will then go around and arrest all the patriot leaders, including myself.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.083]  Don't think that's not what they're moving towards.
[00:47:27.955 --> 00:47:32.518]  If things get so bad in the Depression that you uprise, they will commit atrocities and blame it on you.
[00:47:32.858 --> 00:47:35.720]  It is in the Army Handbook leaked by WikiLeaks.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.021]  Three years ago, the Army does not deny it's theirs.
[00:47:38.361 --> 00:47:44.425]  They admit it's theirs, teaching Army Captains and above who are in Special Ops, Black Ops, how to stage terror.
[00:47:45.466 --> 00:47:48.487]  Here's your canteen, here's your M16, here's your field manual.
[00:47:48.728 --> 00:47:50.829]  Now here's how you stage terror attacks.
[00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.091]  It seems to work best when you kill some kids.
[00:47:55.711 --> 00:47:56.691]  You're a real man, aren't you?
[00:47:57.172 --> 00:47:58.472]  That's why you've moved up to this level.
[00:47:59.132 --> 00:48:03.354]  Don't worry, we're going to have you shipping narcotics into America after a few tours doing this overseas.
[00:48:04.374 --> 00:48:04.994]  They test them.
[00:48:05.915 --> 00:48:13.957]  And they create... And again, folks, I've had family, I'm just going to leave it at that, who, their favorite place to recruit is the Army.
[00:48:14.017 --> 00:48:23.861]  He was a low-level Army officer, recruited by the CIA when he got out of the Army, and they said, first, for your training, we're going to send you to Chicago.
[00:48:26.474 --> 00:48:35.002]  And the stuff was so horrible that this family member told my dad, I know the family member, they don't tell me this stuff, that he just said he refused to do it after a month.
[00:48:35.602 --> 00:48:38.645]  But it was narcotics, trafficking, things even worse.
[00:48:39.946 --> 00:48:41.667]  Who do you think pulls the hits in America?
[00:48:42.788 --> 00:48:43.669]  The army, folks.
[00:48:43.689 --> 00:48:46.552]  They've got hundreds of thousands of former military service people.
[00:48:46.732 --> 00:48:49.114]  They've got hit men in every neighborhood.
[00:48:50.242 --> 00:48:50.543]  Okay?
[00:48:50.924 --> 00:48:51.446]  The U.S.
[00:48:51.606 --> 00:48:55.959]  Army is only the induction center for the black-op army of the New World Order.
[00:48:56.441 --> 00:48:57.925]  I hope you realize that.
[00:49:01.442 --> 00:49:03.103]  Their favorite place to recruit is Texas.
[00:49:03.923 --> 00:49:04.864]  They love Texans.
[00:49:05.784 --> 00:49:07.185]  I've got that from multiple sources.
[00:49:08.105 --> 00:49:10.286]  And they love farm boys.
[00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:12.567]  And they get them all over the Midwest, folks.
[00:49:13.307 --> 00:49:15.408]  And they give them power, money, you name it.
[00:49:16.449 --> 00:49:18.230]  And it is horrible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:24.713]  This country has been... What did Schmedley Butler, Marine Corps Major General,
[00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:32.619]  Set to be the Marine Corps Commandant, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, who overthrew more than 10 third world nations.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.580]  He was approached by Prescott Bush.
[00:49:35.981 --> 00:49:37.301]  He was approached by the Harrimans.
[00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:41.943]  He played along for two months with the plan for him to recruit 500,000 men.
[00:49:42.003 --> 00:49:42.604]  They already had over 100,000.
[00:49:42.644 --> 00:49:44.304]  Former military.
[00:49:44.765 --> 00:49:46.245]  Police chiefs on the payroll.
[00:49:48.446 --> 00:49:51.668]  Even at the time, liquor running, narcotics running.
[00:49:53.055 --> 00:49:57.937]  And he was to lead 500,000 men in a fascist coup over America to link up with Hitler.
[00:49:59.817 --> 00:50:02.058]  He played along long enough to find out the full plot.
[00:50:02.378 --> 00:50:04.299]  He was to be the new dictator, the president.
[00:50:05.639 --> 00:50:10.601]  Just like George Washington, after his tour in office, they said, please come back, do another term.
[00:50:10.621 --> 00:50:11.521]  And he said, no, I've done two.
[00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:12.461]  I'm going back to my farm.
[00:50:14.402 --> 00:50:16.322]  And they came to Butler and they said, you're going to be president.
[00:50:16.602 --> 00:50:17.383]  You're a war hero.
[00:50:17.423 --> 00:50:18.263]  You're totally loved.
[00:50:19.063 --> 00:50:19.983]  You ready for this, sir?
[00:50:20.764 --> 00:50:21.444]  He said, yeah, I'm ready.
[00:50:23.595 --> 00:50:24.276]  They've already done it.
[00:50:24.356 --> 00:50:25.236]  You need to understand that.
[00:50:25.536 --> 00:50:26.977]  They run both houses.
[00:50:27.497 --> 00:50:29.098]  They run almost all the Congress.
[00:50:29.158 --> 00:50:31.259]  Ron Paul has said here on the air that he is in danger.
[00:50:31.899 --> 00:50:32.599]  We brought that up.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.860]  They're raping and robbing everything.
[00:50:36.181 --> 00:50:37.902]  I mean, folks, in my own family,
[00:50:39.463 --> 00:50:44.028]  I know multiple people recruited who then got out and did not go along with it.
[00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:47.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is everywhere.
[00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:48.612]  This is ubiquitous.
[00:50:49.493 --> 00:50:51.735]  They've got over 500,000 in InfraGard.
[00:50:52.356 --> 00:50:54.638]  They've got the clergy response teams recruited by this.
[00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:56.941]  This is an army of pure evil.
[00:51:00.489 --> 00:51:01.730]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:07.132]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.372 --> 00:51:11.994]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.394 --> 00:51:12.774]  It's true.
[00:51:12.854 --> 00:51:17.416]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:17.956 --> 00:51:22.657]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.177 --> 00:51:30.099]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:30.299 --> 00:51:31.199]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:31.419 --> 00:51:37.761]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:38.101 --> 00:51:40.923]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:41.283 --> 00:51:43.164]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:43.504 --> 00:51:44.845]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:45.525 --> 00:51:49.847]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:56.831]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:57.151 --> 00:51:59.592]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.273 --> 00:52:01.814]  America, you've been warned.
[00:52:07.534 --> 00:52:09.055]  The very foundations of our nation.
[00:52:37.594 --> 00:52:37.934]  I don't know.
[00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:04.872]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:53:05.072 --> 00:53:13.715]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:54:11.477 --> 00:54:14.438]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:17.358]  Run on for a long time.
[00:54:18.058 --> 00:54:21.699]  Run on for a long time.
[00:54:21.759 --> 00:54:40.163]  Why do you think 11 years ago, now almost 12, that Prudential and others could meet with the VA and sign a secret deal to take all benefits from World War II vets through current vets that they have them pay into for death insurance?
[00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:46.453]  Why do you think you're getting the news that they've stolen most of the money out of the private and public pension funds?
[00:54:47.094 --> 00:54:48.254]  Because they don't care.
[00:54:49.976 --> 00:54:56.400]  Because they've got Homeland Security out recruiting doctors, lawyers, school teachers, pastors to spy on their neighbors.
[00:54:57.101 --> 00:54:58.321]  To spy on their students.
[00:54:59.042 --> 00:55:04.766]  Because they've recruited hundreds of thousands of former military personnel, predominantly U.S.
[00:55:04.866 --> 00:55:10.030]  Army, to form a giant murderous mafia.
[00:55:11.305 --> 00:55:14.868]  Who they pay out of the $500 billion in narcotics money each year.
[00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:17.750]  America is a giant prison.
[00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:19.732]  We've got more prisons than any other country in the world.
[00:55:20.232 --> 00:55:21.573]  We're a giant police state.
[00:55:22.354 --> 00:55:32.662]  All that's left is free speech, that vestige, and our Second Amendment that the forefathers put in place as an emergency system against tyranny.
[00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:35.044]  All we've got is our courage.
[00:55:36.479 --> 00:55:40.162]  The globalists don't care about those military men that they've got as attack dogs.
[00:55:40.703 --> 00:55:42.785]  They bathe them in DU and deadly vaccines.
[00:55:43.305 --> 00:55:44.886]  They don't care about their own children.
[00:55:46.348 --> 00:55:53.474]  This whole new war is a good smoke screen from Fukushima and the ongoing radiation being belched into the air.
[00:55:54.975 --> 00:55:59.499]  20 plus times safe radiation levels reported in the food.
[00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:01.221]  What, 26 times in Japan.
[00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:04.042]  Radioactive iodine in the water.
[00:56:04.102 --> 00:56:05.103]  Not hearing about that now.
[00:56:05.803 --> 00:56:07.144]  More of that coming up in the next hour.
[00:56:10.427 --> 00:56:18.693]  And this precedent for the UN to pass a resolution on Thursday night, and within 48 hours the bombing had begun.
[00:56:19.373 --> 00:56:21.495]  With ground forces there lazing the targets.
[00:56:22.075 --> 00:56:25.257]  Telling you it was a natural uprising by the Libyans.
[00:56:25.477 --> 00:56:30.041]  You think it's a real uprising targeting key installations in Syria right now?
[00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:34.550]  The Syrians are corrupt.
[00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:46.794]  Qaddafi's corrupt, but do we have the big corrupt bankers that run us, launch wars against them so they can get their oil, and get beachheads to take over the rest of the Middle East, that we've all got to pay for?
[00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:50.775]  Rangel is calling again for a national draft.
[00:56:52.036 --> 00:56:52.816]  That little crook?
[00:56:59.339 --> 00:57:00.499]  I'm speechless at this point.
[00:57:02.264 --> 00:57:08.526]  But you've got Qaddafi saying, to my dear Obama, our son, says Qaddafi, defending attacks on rebels.
[00:57:08.566 --> 00:57:13.267]  Calling Obama, our son, leader Muammar Qaddafi, sent a message to the U.S.
[00:57:13.307 --> 00:57:16.848]  President, defending his decision to attack the rebels, fighting to overthrow him.
[00:57:17.248 --> 00:57:21.070]  Qaddafi, 68, also wrote a letter to French and British leaders in the U.N.
[00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:25.491]  General Assembly, saying the Security Council resolution was void and violated the U.N.
[00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:28.692]  Charter, warning them that they would regret any intervention.
[00:57:29.352 --> 00:57:36.176]  That's exactly what they want, Qaddafi, is for you to launch weapons across the Mediterranean into Europe so they can invade you.
[00:57:37.576 --> 00:57:38.777]  Libya is not for you.
[00:57:39.157 --> 00:57:40.698]  Libya is for Libyans, he said.
[00:57:40.778 --> 00:57:41.838]  No, it's for the New World Order.
[00:57:42.739 --> 00:57:47.161]  Details of Qaddafi's letters were released by the Libyan government spokesman at a news conference in Tripoli.
[00:57:47.661 --> 00:57:54.185]  Defending his decision to attack rebels, Qaddafi told Obama, Al-Qaeda is an armed organization passing through Algeria.
[00:57:57.088 --> 00:58:02.570]  Mali, what would you do if you found them controlling American cities with power and weapons?
[00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:04.030]  Well, Qaddafi, you know they're running them.
[00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:07.892]  What would you do so I can follow your example?
[00:58:08.392 --> 00:58:23.077]  Trying to strike a personal note, Qaddafi prefaces letters saying to our son, His Excellency Mr. Barack Hussein Obama, I have said to you before, who they've met and hugged, that even if Libya and the United States of America enter into war, God forbid, you always remain our son.
[00:58:23.977 --> 00:58:25.818]  Your picture will not be changed.
[00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:38.826]  In his letter to Nicolas Sarkozy, David Cameron and Ban Ki-moon Gaddafi said, Libya is not yours, Libya is for Libyans, the Security Council of the Revolution is void, because it is not, according to the Charter, to interfere with internal affairs of a country.
[00:58:38.846 --> 00:58:47.815]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.257 --> 00:58:51.399]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.419 --> 00:58:58.108]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.369 --> 00:59:00.672]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:00.932 --> 00:59:06.100]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.082]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.322 --> 00:59:11.444]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:11.644 --> 00:59:17.588]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:17.908 --> 00:59:21.111]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.271 --> 00:59:26.815]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.055 --> 00:59:28.376]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:28.716 --> 00:59:29.877]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:29.997 --> 00:59:32.519]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:32.659 --> 00:59:36.721]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:36.881 --> 00:59:41.383]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:41.503 --> 00:59:43.945]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:59:44.105 --> 00:59:47.807]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:47.967 --> 00:59:49.728]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:55.010]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:58.252]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:09.133]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:10.574]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.355 --> 01:00:12.336]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.896 --> 01:00:16.519]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.651 --> 01:00:28.614]  Wayne Madsen's joining us to break down the Fukushima reactor, the situation in Libya, Syria, Bahrain.
[01:00:29.415 --> 01:00:34.237]  The Bahrainian government's saying it's a foreign-backed attempted overthrow of their country.
[01:00:35.338 --> 01:00:47.164]  This new UN precedent is Western-backed rebels, with special forces commanding them, predominantly out of England, attack a country, and the country fights back against rebels.
[01:00:47.364 --> 01:00:52.027]  Now, a bombardment, a no-fly zone, an invasion is reportedly triggered.
[01:00:53.203 --> 01:00:55.864]  And that precedent is now being set.
[01:00:56.664 --> 01:00:58.825]  Now remember, here's the most important thing I've said today.
[01:00:58.865 --> 01:00:59.545]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:01:00.406 --> 01:01:16.732]  The globalists need a war to create artificial patriotic fervor to go along with the debasing of the currency, the robbing of the pension funds, economic martial law being declared in Michigan and other states, regular laws being phased out and suspended.
[01:01:16.972 --> 01:01:18.193]  They won't call it martial law.
[01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.154]  Internet kill switches.
[01:01:20.694 --> 01:01:23.617]  Open calls for censorship of the Internet.
[01:01:24.397 --> 01:01:27.440]  All of this now being done by design.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.661]  They need a war.
[01:01:28.741 --> 01:01:29.742]  What has Tarpley told you?
[01:01:29.782 --> 01:01:30.542]  What have I told you?
[01:01:30.582 --> 01:01:31.783]  What has Dr. Roberts told you?
[01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:35.086]  What has every other serious political mind told you?
[01:01:35.586 --> 01:01:37.628]  The next playbook is war.
[01:01:39.149 --> 01:01:40.090]  All over the world.
[01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:42.592]  And airstrikes going in
[01:01:44.056 --> 01:01:45.137]  To back up the rebels.
[01:01:46.018 --> 01:01:50.202]  Attempted assassination of Gaddafi, which violates federal and international law.
[01:01:50.682 --> 01:01:53.545]  The resolution does not say it's a death penalty.
[01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:59.410]  I guess they killed Slobodan Milošević, never let him have a trial, after they had Al-Qaeda attack the Serbs.
[01:02:00.271 --> 01:02:03.574]  And Al-Qaeda's there doing the same thing, and he doesn't get a judge, jury, executioner.
[01:02:03.834 --> 01:02:05.596]  There can't be a trial where the facts come out.
[01:02:06.581 --> 01:02:08.882]  Not that Qaddafi's good, but everything that's been said is a lie.
[01:02:09.403 --> 01:02:13.906]  So they want to kill him with cruise missiles and 2,000-pound bombs, and they're trying right now.
[01:02:14.946 --> 01:02:17.748]  They've got drones up there, they've got on-the-ground spies.
[01:02:18.348 --> 01:02:19.709]  They're trying to target him.
[01:02:20.049 --> 01:02:24.292]  There's big, secret bounties on his head, you better believe, and they're out to kill him.
[01:02:25.833 --> 01:02:30.256]  So they can roll in, put al-Qaeda in charge, and then turn around and slap them down.
[01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:34.719]  And that'll give the bomb-makers a place to drop bombs.
[01:02:35.663 --> 01:02:41.265]  Now, I want to continue with a total recap of all the latest developments in the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:02:41.665 --> 01:02:45.507]  On the other side, but I also want to take some of your phone calls on these issues.
[01:02:45.547 --> 01:02:47.208]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:02:47.228 --> 01:02:47.268]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:47.288 --> 01:02:48.988]  And while we're busy, focused on this.
[01:02:49.028 --> 01:02:50.889]  While we're busy covering these issues.
[01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:07.595]  While we're busy, focused on what's happening in North Africa.
[01:03:09.337 --> 01:03:13.640]  The radiation cloud from the explosions last week is headed this way.
[01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:27.031]  The headlines are intensifying radiation all over Japan and that's basically on the back burner now and our media, the controlled corporate media is saying, oh, increased radiation levels are no big deal because it's been diluted across the Pacific.
[01:03:27.592 --> 01:03:32.336]  So you do a general background radiation meter, it's only up a little because
[01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:35.774]  It's the little particles individually.
[01:03:35.794 --> 01:03:39.898]  Unless one of those sticks on the front of a Geiger counter, it doesn't go up much.
[01:03:39.938 --> 01:03:48.187]  But if you breathe it, and then it sits there in your lungs, that's what all the nuclear physicists and medical doctors and radiologist experts have explained.
[01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:50.249]  That's why it's dangerous.
[01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.692]  That's why Chernobyl was dangerous.
[01:03:53.492 --> 01:03:55.635]  And that's why the cancers are going up.
[01:03:55.715 --> 01:03:56.495]  One of the cocktail
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:02.561]  of reasons that all of that is now happening as well.
[01:04:03.081 --> 01:04:05.062]  But I do want to take your phone calls.
[01:04:05.082 --> 01:04:11.363]  Will you guys launch my messenger to Minnesota so I can get those?
[01:04:11.423 --> 01:04:12.723]  Thank you.
[01:04:12.743 --> 01:04:12.803]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:20.585]  I have been exhausted lately because I've been thinking about this so intensely and realizing that you notice just everything is going crazy now.
[01:04:20.965 --> 01:04:24.266]  The globalists have flipped the switch and the haywire has begun.
[01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:30.833]  Because they're transitioning into this global government model, this private-corporate global governance model.
[01:04:32.313 --> 01:04:32.934]  And it's on.
[01:04:34.194 --> 01:04:39.016]  And the globalists are moving against all of our liberties, all of our freedoms, in a big way.
[01:04:39.036 --> 01:04:41.597]  A federal jury's convicted.
[01:04:41.617 --> 01:04:45.998]  The Liberty Dollar creator, totally legal what he did according to every law.
[01:04:46.018 --> 01:04:47.459]  Ron Paul said that.
[01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:52.740]  You've got North Carolina, Montana moving for their own gold and silver currencies.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.301]  Will the feds arrest governors?
[01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.979]  This is a global mafia we're under.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.560]  They've got to be stopped.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:04.101]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:04.341 --> 01:05:10.383]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:10.743 --> 01:05:17.845]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:22.687]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:05:23.007 --> 01:05:31.494]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:05:31.674 --> 01:05:35.477]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:05:35.918 --> 01:05:42.123]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:42.683 --> 01:05:46.126]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:46.586 --> 01:05:46.987]  Call us.
[01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:15.216]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:16.246 --> 01:06:19.968]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:20.948 --> 01:06:32.954]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:33.714 --> 01:06:40.978]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:41.658 --> 01:06:51.262]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:55.303]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:55.964 --> 01:06:59.065]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:06:59.645 --> 01:07:03.866]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:04.807]  Number one.
[01:07:05.107 --> 01:07:08.248]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.528 --> 01:07:09.088]  Number two.
[01:07:09.388 --> 01:07:13.930]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.710]  It's true.
[01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:19.571]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:20.432]  Number three.
[01:07:20.712 --> 01:07:23.993]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.293 --> 01:07:27.994]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.214 --> 01:07:28.755]  Number 4.
[01:07:28.995 --> 01:07:31.358]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.758 --> 01:07:35.142]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.442 --> 01:07:35.983]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.243 --> 01:07:40.147]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.388 --> 01:07:45.153]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.433 --> 01:07:49.457]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.597 --> 01:07:51.158]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.378 --> 01:07:53.480]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.122]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.142 --> 01:07:57.443]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.463 --> 01:07:58.464]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:12.812]  Dr. Webster Tarbley is going to be joining us last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:08:13.293 --> 01:08:19.538]  Coming up in about 25 minutes, we've got Wayne Madsen, formerly with the NSA, give us his take on what's happening internationally.
[01:08:20.219 --> 01:08:26.104]  I want to recap and get into some of the latest news in North Africa with Libya and the new war that's been launched there.
[01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:29.967]  Then I want to get into the latest on the Fukushima, Japan ongoing meltdown.
[01:08:30.828 --> 01:08:38.229]  Then I'm going to your phone calls, Jack in Japan, Mark, Marshall, Tim, Ben, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:08:38.969 --> 01:08:40.490]  Here's the most important information.
[01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:45.090]  Even London Telegraph reporting it is Al Qaeda that's been launching the attacks.
[01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:49.511]  SAS backed, British Special Forces backed the entire month-long attack.
[01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:50.851]  They got defeated.
[01:08:51.512 --> 01:08:56.572]  So now the West is publicly bombarding and trying to assassinate Qaddafi that violates international law.
[01:08:57.172 --> 01:08:59.433]  I know at a bestial level, people feel powerful.
[01:09:00.413 --> 01:09:01.495]  This is not our military.
[01:09:01.535 --> 01:09:04.259]  This is the global government's military doing this.
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.722]  Here's the Present Planet article breaking it down.
[01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:07.063]  U.S.
[01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:12.130]  government backs Libyan al-Qaeda while hyping terror attacks inside the United States.
[01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:15.835]  And that's really the biggest news is they're saying, look for Qaddafi to strike.
[01:09:16.636 --> 01:09:19.337]  It would serve the globalists to stage terror attacks now.
[01:09:19.717 --> 01:09:21.397]  I'd say we're in prime danger of it happening.
[01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:21.937]  Not 100%.
[01:09:22.577 --> 01:09:23.577]  They're gauging right now.
[01:09:24.178 --> 01:09:43.601]  To stage terror attacks, then blame it on Qaddafi, use that as a pretext to launch the amphibious invasion with the Marine Corps and NATO, UN-backed invasion ships right off the coast of Tripoli right now, and they get to then crack down on the American people and take more liberties.
[01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:45.962]  In Yemen,
[01:09:47.125 --> 01:09:49.947]  In Bahrain, those are Western allies.
[01:09:50.688 --> 01:09:54.190]  They're having massive riots and the military is cracking down on people.
[01:09:55.171 --> 01:10:04.417]  In the globalist enemy state, rogue state of Syria, the, quote, protesters are hitting key government buildings and telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:10:05.098 --> 01:10:10.541]  And are we going to hear a new UN resolution that an invasion has to now happen in Syria?
[01:10:10.922 --> 01:10:13.704]  Because they're abusing their population, they're abusing
[01:10:14.224 --> 01:10:16.986]  The Globalist Special Forces that are attacking and murdering people.
[01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:18.407]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[01:10:18.467 --> 01:10:23.170]  Army kill team in Afghanistan poses for photos of murdered civilians including children.
[01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:27.275]  This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[01:10:27.735 --> 01:10:30.017]  This is the type of stuff that's unfolding.
[01:10:30.258 --> 01:10:31.259]  Will we be invaded?
[01:10:31.419 --> 01:10:36.885]  Undoubtedly someday when the Southwest gets lit on fire by the illegal alien Ford Foundation controlled groups.
[01:10:37.425 --> 01:10:44.873]  Yeah, there's been open talk about using a UN stabilization force and using Mexican and Canadian troops in the US during civil insurrection.
[01:10:45.173 --> 01:10:46.355]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:10:48.388 --> 01:10:52.311]  Ottawa Citizen, Associated Press, they've been planning this a long time.
[01:10:52.771 --> 01:10:58.315]  NLEO 9, NLEO 10, FEMA drilling with 14 foreign nations to take over the U.S.
[01:10:59.616 --> 01:11:00.877]  Don't think it won't happen here.
[01:11:00.917 --> 01:11:04.440]  Don't think this global government precedent isn't being set with the U.N.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:12.946]  last Thursday ordering the West to start the no-fly, which is doublespeak for bombardment and physical ground invasion.
[01:11:14.861 --> 01:11:22.711]  This is unbelievable what's going on, but it's part of the stratagem of tension predicted by myself and other experts here years ago.
[01:11:23.052 --> 01:11:29.260]  This is the Brzezinski-David Rockefeller global stratagem of destabilization.
[01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:36.420]  There is so much to break down here.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.202]  France is collapsing, France 24 reports.
[01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:40.804]  That's what Le Pen is saying.
[01:11:40.824 --> 01:11:43.006]  We're going to be going over that as well.
[01:11:43.326 --> 01:11:45.028]  Let me shift gears into Fukushima.
[01:11:45.528 --> 01:11:46.429]  Here are the headlines.
[01:11:46.809 --> 01:11:48.131]  Infowars.com.
[01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:51.994]  Japan's nuclear crisis debacle and the depopulation agenda.
[01:11:52.795 --> 01:11:57.740]  Fox News is still rolling footage of the plant before it blew up to make you think it's undamaged.
[01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:01.771]  Pounding rain fuels radiation fears in Japan.
[01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:06.972]  Driving rain on Monday disrupted rescue efforts in Japan and compounded the misery of disaster.
[01:12:07.012 --> 01:12:11.793]  Survivors now facing radioactive fallout from the smoldering wreck of the nuclear plant.
[01:12:12.133 --> 01:12:12.794]  You mean plants.
[01:12:14.254 --> 01:12:21.836]  They're now picking up up to 26 times health regular doses of radiation in spinach, other food and water supplies.
[01:12:23.925 --> 01:12:27.046]  As far away as Tokyo, 150 miles away.
[01:12:27.807 --> 01:12:33.629]  Meanwhile, you've got days and days, over a week of radiation, blowing our way, with no actual readings coming out.
[01:12:33.969 --> 01:12:38.331]  The federal government and UN saying, well, they're above normal, but that's not bad for you.
[01:12:39.071 --> 01:12:48.494]  With again the background radiation is one thing, it's the individualized fallout particles themselves higher that they're picking up from a distance with the Geiger counters.
[01:12:48.514 --> 01:12:55.976]  You breathe that, you get it on your fingers, you rub your eyes, one particle is enough to accelerate your cancer risk massively.
[01:12:56.536 --> 01:12:57.176]  But we're seeing
[01:12:57.856 --> 01:13:00.178]  The cover-up we saw with Chernobyl, Three Mile Island.
[01:13:00.218 --> 01:13:01.138]  Hey, it's no big deal.
[01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:03.019]  In fact, Ann Coulter, Fox News.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.960]  We actually have these clips.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.543]  If you think I'm joking, just type in, Ann Coulter says radiation good for... In fact, folks won't believe that.
[01:13:08.923 --> 01:13:09.624]  Pull up the clip.
[01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.205]  It's from an article Friday.
[01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:12.346]  Go to YouTube.
[01:13:12.426 --> 01:13:14.447]  Ann Coulter says radiation good for... It's a short clip.
[01:13:14.467 --> 01:13:15.628]  We'll play it later as soon as you find it.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.202]  Pounding rain fuels radiation fears in Japan.
[01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:23.306]  Workers flee Japan nuclear plant as smoke rises yet again today.
[01:13:24.307 --> 01:13:29.652]  You're being told by the media, predominantly on the big nightly news, oh, it's cleaned up, problems getting better.
[01:13:29.893 --> 01:13:32.835]  They may have to Chernobyl it and actually cover it with sand and concrete.
[01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.638]  Yeah, it's smoking and still on fire, but don't worry about it.
[01:13:36.219 --> 01:13:40.243]  600,000 plus spent fuel rods, six reactors, four of them have been blown up.
[01:13:40.763 --> 01:13:41.444]  Everything's fine.
[01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:44.310]  Workers flee Japan.
[01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:45.370]  Nuclear plant.
[01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:46.291]  The smoke rises.
[01:13:46.371 --> 01:13:47.351]  Radiation rising.
[01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:50.152]  Gray smoke rose from two nuclear units today.
[01:13:50.572 --> 01:13:58.393]  Temporarily stalling critical work to reconnect power lines and restore cooling systems that stabilize Japan's radiation-leaking nuclear complex.
[01:13:58.433 --> 01:14:00.754]  They dump seawater into all of it that gums up the systems.
[01:14:00.954 --> 01:14:02.074]  There's been huge explosions.
[01:14:02.434 --> 01:14:04.235]  Don't count on that power getting it back on.
[01:14:04.275 --> 01:14:05.035]  I'm just being a realist.
[01:14:05.888 --> 01:14:17.675]  Workers are racing to bring the nuclear plant under control, but the process is proceeding in fits and starts, stalled by incidents like the smoke, and by the need to work methodically to make sure wiring, pumps, and other machinery can be safely switched on.
[01:14:18.215 --> 01:14:19.516]  Our crisis is still going on.
[01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:21.477]  Our crisis is with the nuclear plants.
[01:14:21.737 --> 01:14:23.458]  We're doing everything we can to bring this to an end.
[01:14:23.898 --> 01:14:33.043]  Governor Yuhi Sato of Fukushima Prefecture, where the plant is located, told the more than 1,000 people
[01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:37.436]  Moved away from the plant into a gymnasium.
[01:14:37.476 --> 01:14:38.057]  Don't give up.
[01:14:38.397 --> 01:14:39.519]  We know you are suffering.
[01:14:39.919 --> 01:14:43.645]  Please get us out of here, yelled a 63-year-old Japanese truck driver.
[01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:51.920]  What caused the smoke to billow first from Unit 3 at Fukushima Daiichi plant and later from Unit 2 is still under investigation.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:52.740]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:15:01.283]  They admit partial meltdowns of four of the plants, explosions, two reactor cores breached, 600,000 plus fuel rods blown hither and there.
[01:15:02.023 --> 01:15:07.105]  Nuclear Safety Agency officials said still in the days since March 11th earthquake, the tsunami wracked
[01:15:07.645 --> 01:15:11.147]  The plant's cooling system, both reactors have overheated and seen explosions.
[01:15:11.187 --> 01:15:11.808]  Four of them have.
[01:15:12.188 --> 01:15:14.929]  Workers were evacuated from the area to buildings nearby.
[01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:18.832]  The radiation levels remain steady, the official said.
[01:15:19.212 --> 01:15:20.633]  That's a nice way to spin higher levels.
[01:15:20.773 --> 01:15:21.333]  They're steady.
[01:15:22.714 --> 01:15:24.675]  Problems set off by disasters have ranged.
[01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:27.937]  The head of the plant said last Friday that it's enough to kill you.
[01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:29.118]  He started crying.
[01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:30.359]  He couldn't be part of the cover-up anymore.
[01:15:31.206 --> 01:15:44.352]  Problems set off from the disasters have ravaged and raged far beyond the devastated northeast coast and wreaked nuclear plant, handing the government what has been called Japan's worst crisis since World War II.
[01:15:45.593 --> 01:15:46.713]  Man, I'm exhausted, folks.
[01:15:46.753 --> 01:15:47.534]  I know you are, too.
[01:15:48.134 --> 01:15:53.637]  Imagine the people in there trying to secure those plants so they don't have total meltdown, which may have even happened.
[01:15:53.657 --> 01:15:54.517]  We don't know the truth.
[01:15:55.938 --> 01:15:56.918]  Cover-ups are admitted.
[01:15:56.958 --> 01:15:58.039]  We just don't know the extent.
[01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:03.342]  Imagine them risking their lives just watching this, just reporting on it is exhausting.
[01:16:09.423 --> 01:16:09.703]  U.S.
[01:16:09.743 --> 01:16:11.783]  makes potassium iodine available in Japan.
[01:16:12.583 --> 01:16:15.504]  Now we know why the government's been hoarding it, because they're shipping it to Japan.
[01:16:15.544 --> 01:16:16.084]  Makes sense.
[01:16:17.304 --> 01:16:20.585]  Taiwan Japanese restaurant offers radiation checks for diners.
[01:16:23.665 --> 01:16:27.426]  Japanese government emits potassium iodine pills, should have been distributed earlier.
[01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:30.428]  Always something good to have in your medicine cabinet.
[01:16:30.948 --> 01:16:33.129]  Japan radiation release long-term problem.
[01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:43.175]  France's ASN says the release of radiation from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant will be a problem for Japan to years to come.
[01:16:43.215 --> 01:16:45.316]  What about us directly in the line of the fallout?
[01:16:45.576 --> 01:16:49.798]  According to French nuclear watchdog, we are at the beginning of the post-accident phase.
[01:16:49.998 --> 01:16:53.320]  André-Claude Lacoste, head of the Paris-based
[01:16:54.997 --> 01:17:01.379]  Nuclear watchdog group said at a press conference in Paris today, Japan will have to deal with the consequences of this accident.
[01:17:02.519 --> 01:17:05.520]  Japan will have to deal with the consequences of this accident for decades.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:15.602]  Radioactive contamination, which has been significant, could spread as far as 100 kilometers around the site, he said, or already has, said Japan's chief cabinet secretary.
[01:17:21.772 --> 01:17:29.595]  And they're saying radiation levels, 26 times normal levels, found on spinach and in the water and other food, is safe.
[01:17:31.136 --> 01:17:32.516]  Tell that to folks that get cancer.
[01:17:32.836 --> 01:17:34.817]  Jack in Japan, what can you tell us Jack?
[01:17:36.161 --> 01:17:41.022]  Well, basically, Alex, the first thing I've got to let you know, I'm not sure I haven't heard you report on this yet.
[01:17:41.102 --> 01:17:59.847]  If you have in today's episode, I apologize, but the first thing I want to let you know is that in our drinking water, we've now got dangerous levels of radioactive iodine-131 and cesium-137 in the prefectures of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Gunma, Tochigi, and in diminished levels, but even in Tokyo.
[01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:01.138]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:01.178 --> 01:18:04.420]  We did report that last night and today, but I should have reported it more.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:15.644]  In fact, we'll put on screen, just search the term, radioactive iodine, found in Japanese drinking water and food, as well as some other isotopes, in one prefecture, 26 times safe levels.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:17.380]  That's correct.
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:18.040]  That's correct.
[01:18:18.641 --> 01:18:20.421]  And I got a message for Ann Coulter.
[01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:30.745]  If she thinks radiation is so nutritious, then I'll either pay for her airfare to come out here, or I'll brew up a pot of coffee with my Cesium-137 water and I'll ship it to her.
[01:18:31.185 --> 01:18:32.706]  Well, that's a good point to make!
[01:18:33.226 --> 01:18:35.587]  We should publicly challenge Ann Coulter.
[01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:42.990]  In fact, I'm publicly saying that I will pay for her a first-class ticket to Tokyo from wherever she lives.
[01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.631]  In fact, I want to get Watson or Aaron Dykes or Kurt.
[01:18:46.031 --> 01:18:48.112]  I want to put the challenge out at InfoWars.com.
[01:18:49.252 --> 01:18:59.682]  to Ann Coulter right now that I will pay for her a first class ticket, room and board, to go to Fukushima and I'm sure they'll let her tour the reactors themselves.
[01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:03.986]  If it's so good, I think she should go drink water directly from the reactor cores.
[01:19:05.194 --> 01:19:07.336]  Oh, and Alex, I will drive her up there personally.
[01:19:07.396 --> 01:19:10.139]  I was disgusted when I heard those comments, I swear to goodness.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:23.173]  And one more note of concern, you are correct, the work at the reactors was suspended at 3.55 local time today due to fires in the reactor cores, and one of the reactors is the number 3 reactor that's the dangerous MOX reactor.
[01:19:23.873 --> 01:19:33.116]  Um, and according to my research, we've got something on the order of 1,760 tons of, um, uh, you know, live and spent fuel on site.
[01:19:33.597 --> 01:19:39.799]  And you compare that to Chernobyl with 180 tons and, um, this, this thing is pretty serious if you ask me.
[01:19:40.387 --> 01:19:41.428]  Tell you what, stay there, Jack.
[01:19:41.448 --> 01:19:43.571]  Your intel is absolutely on target from all our research.
[01:19:43.591 --> 01:19:47.215]  I want to get more from you on the other side than Mark, Marshall, Tim, Ben and others.
[01:19:47.675 --> 01:19:48.616]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.560]  This is the Genesis Network, GCNlive.com.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.384]  There is no doubt that there's an ongoing cover-up about the disaster in Japan.
[01:19:55.585 --> 01:19:57.086]  They're using the new war as a distraction.
[01:20:01.613 --> 01:20:05.234]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:08.635]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:13.656]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:20:13.676 --> 01:20:19.898]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:20:20.058 --> 01:20:22.299]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:20:22.839 --> 01:20:23.119]  Tim Geithner?
[01:20:23.139 --> 01:20:23.380]  Bernanke?
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:23.940]  They're arsonists!
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:24.761]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:20:24.781 --> 01:20:25.782]  And the Congress is saying...
[01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:41.596]  Who do we make the check out to?
[01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.577]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:20:43.597 --> 01:20:48.621]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:06.293]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:21:06.733 --> 01:21:08.034]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:21:08.314 --> 01:21:16.197]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:21:16.378 --> 01:21:25.321]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation, what's going on as a nation.
[01:21:25.382 --> 01:21:27.783]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:21:28.163 --> 01:21:37.807]  Dr. Barry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:21:37.987 --> 01:21:39.607]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:21:39.687 --> 01:21:41.268]  They're not just economic.
[01:21:41.288 --> 01:21:42.228]  They're philosophical.
[01:21:42.308 --> 01:21:43.969]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:21:43.989 --> 01:21:45.429]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:47.969]  Read Cha-Ching Wisdom by Dr. David Barry.

[01:21:59.704 --> 01:22:00.966]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:01.006 --> 01:22:06.353]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:22:06.594 --> 01:22:11.240]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:22:11.621 --> 01:22:16.648]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:22:17.168 --> 01:22:21.871]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:24:12.045 --> 01:24:15.527]  We're putting our money where Ann Coulter's mouth is.
[01:24:16.087 --> 01:24:21.349]  HurtonMO at InfoWars.com right now is writing the story, the headline.
[01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:27.692]  We will pay Ann Coulter to go to Fukushima Radiation Zone.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:33.183]  We're going to state it for, okay lady, you say radiation is good for you and there's a growing body of evidence.
[01:24:33.683 --> 01:24:36.485]  They target certain cancers with it because it kills cells.
[01:24:37.185 --> 01:24:38.986]  Not the entire body being hit by it.
[01:24:39.086 --> 01:24:41.187]  Every major study shows it increases cancer.
[01:24:41.608 --> 01:24:42.528]  No one denies that.
[01:24:43.049 --> 01:24:44.650]  But this is their brazen propaganda.
[01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:48.452]  Not only is the radiation hitting the US not bad, it's good for you.
[01:24:50.233 --> 01:24:51.794]  Yes, it's very good for the atomic soldiers.
[01:24:51.814 --> 01:24:54.016]  It was very good for the folks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[01:24:54.397 --> 01:24:58.340]  It's very good for plant workers that have inhaled uranium and plutonium.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.523]  Even the folks that mine it, when it's not enriched, die from it.
[01:25:02.544 --> 01:25:03.024]  Incredible.
[01:25:03.725 --> 01:25:06.327]  Jack, I mean, talk about brazen propaganda.
[01:25:06.347 --> 01:25:07.088]  That's certainly it.
[01:25:07.148 --> 01:25:08.008]  Jack from Japan.
[01:25:08.389 --> 01:25:09.450]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:25:10.595 --> 01:25:18.323]  Well, basically, you know, I had a meeting with several people today, and basically everybody knows that the government is lying to us, and everyone is getting very, very angry.
[01:25:19.003 --> 01:25:21.946]  Not just at the government, but at the Tokyo Power and Electric Company.
[01:25:22.026 --> 01:25:22.647]  Everybody knows.
[01:25:23.528 --> 01:25:31.756]  Just the basic design of these reactors, I mean, why would you put something that's dangerous, fissile, and can't explode on top of something
[01:25:32.196 --> 01:25:33.678]  That can explode.
[01:25:33.738 --> 01:25:38.926]  In other words, I'm sure as your listeners know, they've got the spent fuel rods in the grooves of these reactors.
[01:25:39.006 --> 01:25:45.235]  And so it's like, why would I store my gasoline on top of my, you know, on top of my pile of, you know, fireworks?
[01:25:45.255 --> 01:25:46.958]  No, no, on top of your stove!
[01:25:48.098 --> 01:25:49.239]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:25:49.879 --> 01:25:51.980]  And the people are really starting to get wise quick.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:26:00.484]  And some of the good news is some of the local level government people, as you mentioned, the mayor of the one particular town and the governor of Fukushima, they're getting wise quick too.
[01:26:00.524 --> 01:26:01.985]  And I'll tell you what, people are getting really angry.
[01:26:02.245 --> 01:26:07.927]  And I am definitely going down to Tokyo Power and Electric in Tokyo to talk to some managers.
[01:26:07.947 --> 01:26:12.370]  And I'm going to film it and do a little We Are Change-style gorilla filming when I get the chance.
[01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:17.252]  One more thing I want to add, Alex, get this, they haven't even closed the schools.
[01:26:17.712 --> 01:26:20.775]  Okay, the kids are walking 20-30 minutes going to schools.
[01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:27.239]  They're playing outdoors for an hour during recess, especially right about now because the school year changes over in April here in Japan.
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.941]  It's, uh, what is it, September in America?
[01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:31.262]  Well, no, I saw that in the news.
[01:26:31.643 --> 01:26:34.065]  That's just like 9-11 with all the asbestos dust.
[01:26:34.485 --> 01:26:39.629]  They've got to say don't wear masks, they've got to keep the schools open, or they'd have to admit that there was a problem.
[01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:41.431]  Exactly.
[01:26:41.652 --> 01:26:42.132]  Exactly.
[01:26:42.172 --> 01:26:43.533]  And so it's just everything's fine.
[01:26:43.553 --> 01:26:44.634]  Just go back to sleep.
[01:26:44.754 --> 01:26:45.455]  No problem.
[01:26:45.515 --> 01:26:46.495]  Send your kids to school.
[01:26:46.836 --> 01:26:54.662]  Meanwhile, it's raining and they're playing outside and we've still got... Here where I'm at, the radiation has gone down a little bit.
[01:26:54.702 --> 01:26:58.485]  It's only about six times the normal amount of radiation.
[01:26:58.945 --> 01:27:02.228]  But in other parts, a little bit closer, it's really bad.
[01:27:02.268 --> 01:27:06.931]  Like in Ibaraki Prefecture and in Tochigi Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture.
[01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:08.833]  And again, that's an error reading.
[01:27:09.193 --> 01:27:18.220]  Not the spinach, not the water, where it's dissipated and basically condensed and had a chance to bioaccumulate.
[01:27:19.381 --> 01:27:19.881]  Exactly.
[01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:33.232]  And you better believe, when they started taking the spinach off the shelves, a lot of the people that I know, including just, you know, little grandmas and grandpas who don't even really follow, you know, the news too well, they really started to wake up when they saw this.
[01:27:33.552 --> 01:27:38.256]  You know, one other thing, Alex, I wanted to share with your listeners is just,
[01:27:38.716 --> 01:27:41.617]  You've mentioned it before on your show and I just want to say it's true here.
[01:27:42.537 --> 01:27:51.779]  Spread this information out because people might chuckle at you right now, they might not believe you right now, but when this stuff starts coming true later, they're really going to start listening to you.
[01:27:51.819 --> 01:28:04.581]  And believe me, the people who listened to me but didn't buy any storable food or water, that's the group of people who came to me today to have a meeting at my house to talk to me about what we should do about this situation because they understood that
[01:28:05.001 --> 01:28:06.403]  Very well said, Jack, from Japan.
[01:28:06.443 --> 01:28:07.824]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:28:27.862 --> 01:28:32.587]  Oh, just that, just that, let me tell you, um, people really are living on pins and needles here.
[01:28:32.668 --> 01:28:35.991]  I mean, I've got, I, I, I used to live in Fukushima, Alex.
[01:28:36.051 --> 01:28:43.460]  I, I, I look at the pictures of, uh, of like Iwaki in Fukushima and I recognize the streets and now they're just torn to shreds.
[01:28:44.561 --> 01:28:52.547]  Another place that has been really damaged are the graveyards, and graveyards are really important because it's like your whole family history goes into one single grave, alright?
[01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:59.493]  And so for hundreds of years, for one single grave, it's all your grandparents and great-grandparents and everything, and now it's just smashed.
[01:29:00.494 --> 01:29:03.656]  And so people are just really, pretty much just living day-to-day.
[01:29:03.997 --> 01:29:05.978]  And it's really, it's a sad situation.
[01:29:06.018 --> 01:29:09.701]  And just people, people out there, listeners and everybody, just pray for Japan.
[01:29:10.662 --> 01:29:12.664]  Just pray for us if you can, and I appreciate it.
[01:29:13.157 --> 01:29:13.798]  We will, Jack.
[01:29:13.818 --> 01:29:14.980]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.810]  I will get to Mark, Marshall, Tim, Ben and others while Wayne Madsen is live on air with us.
[01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:26.800]  We're going to look more into Fukushima with him, but also what's happening in North Africa in this new war.
[01:29:28.151 --> 01:29:28.851]  The U.N.
[01:29:29.772 --> 01:29:30.392]  launched this.
[01:29:30.412 --> 01:29:31.712]  This is the purest U.N.
[01:29:31.772 --> 01:29:32.412]  war ever.
[01:29:32.813 --> 01:29:34.593]  Congress had nothing to even say.
[01:29:34.613 --> 01:29:42.716]  This was the United Nations basically calling the shots, as Obama said, another big step for globalism.
[01:29:43.716 --> 01:29:49.278]  Anytime there's a protest in a country now, there's any police brutality, look for us to invade.
[01:29:50.498 --> 01:29:51.419]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.899 --> 01:29:53.500]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.121]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.188 --> 01:30:03.851]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:04.011 --> 01:30:08.074]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:08.294 --> 01:30:13.338]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:13.358 --> 01:30:18.181]  I was looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:18.942 --> 01:30:25.967]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:28.727 --> 01:30:33.633]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:34.254 --> 01:30:35.855]  We're American and be proud.
[01:30:35.896 --> 01:30:37.918]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:30:37.938 --> 01:30:42.683]  The land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:30:43.124 --> 01:30:46.808]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:59.252]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:31:01.187 --> 01:31:07.871]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:31:08.211 --> 01:31:10.452]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:31:10.893 --> 01:31:19.698]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:31:19.918 --> 01:31:26.502]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:31:28.763 --> 01:31:29.123]  We're good to go.
[01:32:03.691 --> 01:32:04.591]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:08.494]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:08.834 --> 01:32:11.095]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.115 --> 01:32:16.578]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:23.242]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:23.642 --> 01:32:29.186]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.606 --> 01:32:33.309]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:37.812]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.112 --> 01:32:43.616]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.057 --> 01:32:47.179]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.599 --> 01:32:49.040]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.021]  It's here.

[01:32:57.162 --> 01:33:05.284]  Oh, sinner man, where you gonna run to?
[01:33:05.304 --> 01:33:06.584]  Sinner man, where you gonna run to?
[01:33:20.523 --> 01:33:24.326]  We're gonna run too, all on that day.
[01:33:25.126 --> 01:33:26.427]  Will I run to the rock?
[01:33:27.708 --> 01:33:29.990]  Please hide me, I'll run to the rock.
[01:33:30.991 --> 01:33:33.172]  Please hide me, I'll run to the rock.
[01:33:34.393 --> 01:33:37.796]  Please hide me, Lord, all on that day.
[01:33:38.616 --> 01:33:41.038]  Put the rock crowd out.
[01:33:41.058 --> 01:33:43.400]  I can't hide you, the rock crowd.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.642]  I can't hide you, the rock crowd.
[01:33:47.583 --> 01:33:49.904]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:33:49.984 --> 01:33:52.626]  We are halfway into this worldwide broadcast.
[01:33:53.066 --> 01:33:56.568]  We just talked to Japan, to a caller in Japan, Jack.
[01:33:56.928 --> 01:33:59.529]  We're going to continue with your phone calls throughout this hour into the next.
[01:33:59.569 --> 01:34:03.391]  In the last 30 minutes of the next hour, Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us.
[01:34:05.452 --> 01:34:15.358]  Words cannot describe how hypocritical and ridiculous it is that the West, the big banks, the military-industrial complex,
[01:34:16.431 --> 01:34:38.381]  that runs our country claimed a month ago that they didn't have any special forces in libya and that they weren't involved in the destabilization program now it's been admitted for at least three weeks that british special forces and other mercenaries not just regular government S.A.S.
[01:34:38.462 --> 01:34:45.345]  special or services are in the country leading the groups and that yes it is quote the CIA al-qaeda brigade
[01:34:46.835 --> 01:34:50.017]  Out of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
[01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:53.540]  And it's in the London Telegraph, CNN.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.122]  They go, oh, is it wrong that Al-Qaeda's hailing this?
[01:34:56.542 --> 01:34:57.523]  That Al-Qaeda's doing it?
[01:34:57.583 --> 01:34:58.243]  Maybe not.
[01:34:59.024 --> 01:35:02.346]  Al-Qaeda was good when they attacked Serbia as a pretext to start that war.
[01:35:02.787 --> 01:35:05.128]  Oh, look, the Serbs are being mean to the Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:08.431]  We've got to invade and hand it over to Albania, basically.
[01:35:09.239 --> 01:35:12.701]  Oh, they used Al Qaeda to attack and start the war with the Russians.
[01:35:13.281 --> 01:35:14.882]  Is that saying the Russians were little angels?
[01:35:14.962 --> 01:35:15.202]  No.
[01:35:15.642 --> 01:35:19.244]  The point is, the globalists are starting these wars.
[01:35:21.065 --> 01:35:25.607]  And now they've tried to assassinate Qaddafi in the last 24 hours with cruise missiles and bombs.
[01:35:26.067 --> 01:35:28.728]  That's confirmed by BBC and others.
[01:35:29.429 --> 01:35:31.029]  That's a violation of international law.
[01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:32.770]  No judge, no jury, no execution.
[01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:36.512]  The no-fly zone doesn't say they can try to kill Qaddafi.
[01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:47.935]  Notice Hillary and others have said you will accept a humanitarian force that's a ground force or we will completely destroy you.
[01:35:48.475 --> 01:35:56.058]  So this is a new war and it's part of this larger strategy of tension and we have the UN with its ruling
[01:35:57.230 --> 01:36:00.973]  With its resolution Thursday, ordering this launch and calling it a no-fly zone.
[01:36:01.194 --> 01:36:09.321]  But in the body is the language for aerial bombardments that are now on and physical invasion with two Marine Corps giant amphibious invasion ships.
[01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:15.426]  They're basically Marine Corps ground invasion command carriers.
[01:36:15.587 --> 01:36:16.788]  They're like stub carriers.
[01:36:17.148 --> 01:36:22.373]  They're about 60% the size of a regular carrier the Navy has.
[01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:25.210]  You can pull them up if you want online.
[01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.111]  Their names are in the news.
[01:36:27.131 --> 01:36:29.011]  They're similar to the Coronado, but it's not there.
[01:36:29.632 --> 01:36:36.355]  That was the Coronado I watched do a drill of landing in the Bay Area of Oakland and San Francisco and disgorging U.S.
[01:36:36.375 --> 01:36:41.777]  Marines and foreign troops with role-players screaming, I'm an American, please no not the camp, don't take my gun.
[01:36:42.798 --> 01:36:44.559]  That was a big wake-up call for me in 1999.
[01:36:44.679 --> 01:36:46.800]  It's in my film, Police Day 2000, by the way.
[01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:54.170]  Wayne Madsen is a Washington, D.C.-based investigative journalist, author, and syndicated columnist.
[01:36:54.491 --> 01:37:03.106]  He's written for The Village Voice, The Progressive, Counterpunch, Online Journal, CorpWatch, Multinational Monitor, News Insider, These Times, The American Conservative.
[01:37:04.514 --> 01:37:10.876]  His columns have appeared in the Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer, Columbus Dispatch, Sacramento Bee, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others.
[01:37:11.256 --> 01:37:17.897]  He's been all over international television, formerly with the NSA, before that in submarine warfare, anti-submarine warfare.
[01:37:18.618 --> 01:37:20.138]  Also worked for RCA Corporation.
[01:37:20.438 --> 01:37:22.559]  He reports from Capitol Hill and the National Press Club.
[01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.679]  waynemadsonreport.com is the website.
[01:37:25.159 --> 01:37:27.340]  We're linked to it on infowars.com.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.321]  Wayne, looking at this, it's quite a precedent.
[01:37:30.361 --> 01:37:30.921]  We now have
[01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:37.326]  Clearly special forces-backed hitting key targets, government buildings, telecommunications in Syria.
[01:37:38.206 --> 01:37:46.793]  The new president said that if sovereign governments repel western-backed rebels, that there will then be a western invasion.
[01:37:47.214 --> 01:37:52.138]  Is this the Zbigniew Brzezinski destabilization program that he wrote about three years ago?
[01:37:53.263 --> 01:38:11.146]  Well, I'll tell you, I think what we're seeing playing out in Libya, and now also probably in Yemen, is the co-option of these Arab revolts by the CIA and their allied intelligence and special forces units in these NATO countries.
[01:38:13.026 --> 01:38:17.107]  No one would doubt that what happened in Tunisia probably surprised a lot of people.
[01:38:17.507 --> 01:38:22.648]  That's then spread to Egypt, and it was clear that it was bound to
[01:38:23.148 --> 01:38:23.628]  We're good to go.
[01:38:50.909 --> 01:39:16.968]  Forces in the country, but I think that there's probably now two types of or two forms of Libyan opposition There are those who are Libyan nationalists who just want to see Qaddafi go and then there's the others who have been waiting in the wings in London in Washington and other places waiting for this moment and these are the groups that are probably going to want to take over with the CIA and MI6's support and
[01:39:17.728 --> 01:39:28.277]  And what we're going to see is Libya's tremendous oil deposits being the target for these countries.
[01:39:28.857 --> 01:39:29.598]  Now that said,
[01:39:30.797 --> 01:39:50.574]  I think we also have to look at there's a huge split with the NATO and the European Union and we probably haven't seen a split like this in NATO since the 1956 invasion by Britain and France of Suez and of course President Eisenhower would not support that and that created a major rift in NATO
[01:39:51.034 --> 01:40:00.100]  Now we see Turkey and Germany, two large NATO countries after the United States as far as military power is concerned, not supporting this effort.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:15.009]  And the worst thing, the Italians are now involved, and that is the former colonial power that ruled Libya, and I can't think of anything worse than having Italians participate in a military adventure against Libya.
[01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:16.710]  Benito Mussolini!
[01:40:17.491 --> 01:40:19.896]  Actually invaded, for those that don't know.
[01:40:20.217 --> 01:40:27.833]  Now they'll say he's a good guy but for those that don't know, this will clearly now unify more Libyans behind Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:40:29.053 --> 01:40:48.123]  Right and we have of course Mussolini's ideological son Silvio Berlusconi now in power in Italy and of course he's facing all kinds of legal problems messing around with underage hookers and the guy's mafiosi from the word go but he's looking at this obviously as a
[01:40:48.643 --> 01:40:49.423]  We're good to go.
[01:41:18.294 --> 01:41:21.757]  Presidential campaign was bankrolled by Libyan money.
[01:41:21.817 --> 01:41:35.707]  Now that brings up the whole thing with the Clearstream bank accounts, Sarkozy being funded from money outside of France, and he went after Dominique de Villepin, tried to put him in jail for
[01:41:36.087 --> 01:41:36.887]  for slander.
[01:41:56.232 --> 01:41:59.296]  Herman Van Rompuy just a few months ago embracing Gaddafi.
[01:41:59.796 --> 01:42:04.742]  You have the British government embracing him, selling him most of his weapons.
[01:42:05.302 --> 01:42:10.669]  Is this an attempt to go ahead and kill Gaddafi so that he won't use all of his blackmail on them?
[01:42:12.065 --> 01:42:13.086]  Well, I think so.
[01:42:13.146 --> 01:42:18.289]  He's obviously got, you know, a lot of information about what's been going on behind the scenes.
[01:42:19.289 --> 01:42:25.233]  Just like Saddam Hussein had a lot of information about some of these leaders of these Western countries.
[01:42:25.693 --> 01:42:35.079]  And obviously, the launch of the Tomahawk that hit his compound in Tripoli, where I actually was in October 2009, there's a monument there to the
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.246]  Reagan attack against Gaddafi, where his daughter was killed in 1986.
[01:42:42.007 --> 01:42:49.757]  And that's a violation of Executive Order 12333, which prohibits the assassination of foreign leaders.
[01:42:49.797 --> 01:42:52.621]  Of course, we've violated that so many times.
[01:42:53.041 --> 01:43:13.892]  Times over the years with the you know the insane and and and and there's been other covert operations against other world leaders that haven't gotten as much publicity over the years but not now we see a group in Congress Democrats and Republicans saying look Obama went to the US
[01:43:14.452 --> 01:43:18.956]  He went to NATO, but he never went to Congress to get authorization for this action.
[01:43:19.396 --> 01:43:28.063]  And there's one Democrat apparently who's apparently willing to put forward articles of impeachment against President Obama.
[01:43:28.543 --> 01:43:33.687]  Wayne Madsen, let me stop you right there because that's the big issue I've been making since last Thursday.
[01:43:34.728 --> 01:43:42.017]  No statements, no even resolution, much less a declaration of war, which we haven't had since World War II.
[01:43:42.497 --> 01:43:45.941]  Now we're seeing nothing from Congress within 24 hours of the UN.
[01:43:49.465 --> 01:44:00.290]  Voting for a no-fly zone, it turns into a bombardment with British news reporting that SAS smash squads are on the ground in Libya to mark targets for coalition jets.
[01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:04.932]  The rebels arrested a bunch of SAS, as you know, two weeks ago.
[01:44:05.152 --> 01:44:06.413]  That embarrassed everybody.
[01:44:07.133 --> 01:44:13.016]  Clearly they waited till the rebels were backed up in a corner so that they would have to accept
[01:44:13.916 --> 01:44:14.977]  Western intervention.
[01:44:15.878 --> 01:44:18.539]  What's the larger strategy in all of this?
[01:44:18.599 --> 01:44:20.821]  Why do you think this came together so fast?
[01:44:20.841 --> 01:44:28.886]  Does it play into the trillion-dollar nuke industry desperately needing a distraction from the radioactive clouds still drifting this way?
[01:44:30.339 --> 01:44:34.722]  Oh wow, it hasn't been interesting the last couple of weeks with the way the news cycle has gone.
[01:44:34.782 --> 01:44:44.348]  First we had massive coverage of the Arab Revolt, then we had the earthquake, tsunami, and the nuclear disaster in Japan, and now we're back to Libya.
[01:44:44.428 --> 01:44:54.374]  So, you know, the news media, the corporate media, only goes for the news of the day, and then other major news events are not covered.
[01:44:54.734 --> 01:44:57.055]  And I think we're seeing a lot of that play out now.
[01:44:57.135 --> 01:45:00.056]  It's the news du jour, as I call it here in Washington.
[01:45:01.096 --> 01:45:08.339]  So, yeah, I think that plays a lot into this, a lot, that the focus is moving away from other issues.
[01:45:08.419 --> 01:45:23.585]  As you said, the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima being a major story that's not only being suppressed by the Japanese government, media, TEPCO, but also I think we see a lot of the nuke industry here, the nuke lobby,
[01:45:24.345 --> 01:45:28.628]  Uh, uh, trying to play down the, uh, the, the, the safety effects of that.
[01:45:28.708 --> 01:45:42.598]  So, so I think a lot of these, this, this news is intertwined, uh, and, and, and the, the gatekeepers, the corporate news gatekeepers are trying to have it their own way and how they report these, uh, these breaking stories.
[01:45:43.376 --> 01:45:46.177]  Wayne, I want to get more into the unfolding crisis.
[01:45:46.237 --> 01:45:49.059]  Still having trouble getting those reactors under control.
[01:45:49.159 --> 01:45:53.981]  More gas explosions, more off-gassing unfolding today.
[01:45:54.421 --> 01:46:00.064]  Japanese still talking about a Chernobyl option of just burying the reactors.
[01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:02.645]  I want to get into Ann Coulter saying radiation's good for you.
[01:46:03.105 --> 01:46:04.286]  That's the actual headline.
[01:46:04.626 --> 01:46:08.908]  But before we go there, why do you think
[01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:18.332]  Obama went with this to strengthen global governance, to strengthen the corporate state through the UN, to totally cut Congress out of the loop.
[01:46:18.612 --> 01:46:24.415]  What's the constellation, the cocktail of reasons that they engaged in this naked act?
[01:46:25.615 --> 01:46:25.995]  I don't know.
[01:46:46.201 --> 01:46:53.771]  Hillary's also said this, that if he doesn't accept a humanitarian ground force, that means an armed force, that there will be an invasion.
[01:46:53.811 --> 01:46:56.975]  So they pretty much stated the ground invasion right there.
[01:46:57.296 --> 01:47:01.882]  We've got Gaddafi handing out over a million firearms, preparing for guerrilla warfare.
[01:47:03.234 --> 01:47:11.157]  Right, and I think what this shows is that Obama is no different than his predecessor when it comes to these coalitions of the willing.
[01:47:11.357 --> 01:47:12.877]  We saw this play out in Iraq.
[01:47:12.917 --> 01:47:15.058]  We saw it play out in Afghanistan.
[01:47:15.698 --> 01:47:17.279]  And here we see it playing out again.
[01:47:18.339 --> 01:47:21.020]  Look, there were no vetoes in the U.N.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:24.661]  Security Council, but it was to establish a no-fly zone.
[01:47:25.261 --> 01:47:27.402]  Now we even have the Arab League that supported
[01:47:28.062 --> 01:47:29.403]  No fly zone saying wait a minute.
[01:47:29.423 --> 01:47:52.193]  We weren't talking about launching cruise missiles and killing civilians Which we have many reports now that many civilians were killed by these NATO strikes on Libya So they parade out a couple of countries a few Air Force planes from Qatar in the United Arab Emirates big deal We don't see where's Egypt in this whole operation So yeah, it's it's it's Obama is a neocon
[01:47:52.233 --> 01:47:54.055]  What about this precedent, Wayne?
[01:48:12.276 --> 01:48:23.879]  What about the precedent being set here, where any time there's an uprising in a country, and if the nation crushes them in any way, then there's got to be a UN-ordered invasion.
[01:48:24.199 --> 01:48:31.481]  But then there's the hypocrisy of the West crushing and killing demonstrators, as has happened in England at G20 and other events.
[01:48:31.521 --> 01:48:33.702]  There's the specter of cops shooting people in the back.
[01:48:34.402 --> 01:48:37.723]  There's the specter of these similar things.
[01:48:38.363 --> 01:48:40.884]  On the heels of the hypocrisy energized,
[01:48:41.824 --> 01:48:44.747]  The illustration energized and highlighted by U.S.
[01:48:44.827 --> 01:49:00.585]  Army kill team in Afghanistan posed for photos of murdered civilians including little bloody dead children with the quote kill teams as private Gruckheimer first revealed eight years ago that they're ordered to go into villages and kill babies and everyone.
[01:49:02.085 --> 01:49:04.147]  Yeah, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:49:04.427 --> 01:49:08.270]  You look at what's going on in the Middle East, North Africa right now.
[01:49:08.891 --> 01:49:17.018]  Okay, the president of Algeria brutally put down demonstrations in Algiers, but he's a good friend of Sarkozy in France.
[01:49:17.058 --> 01:49:18.138]  He's a good friend of ours.
[01:49:18.199 --> 01:49:21.902]  We're not seeing no-fly zones established over Algeria, for example.
[01:49:22.742 --> 01:49:28.147]  We now have several Yemeni generals, many of whom were part of this regime in Yemen, corrupt
[01:49:28.667 --> 01:49:44.585]  As all get out now saying oh we're with the opposition that looks to me like the CIA is trying to also co-opt the Yemeni revolution just like they did the Libyan revolution and obviously they want President Saleh gone just like they wanted Qaddafi gone.
[01:49:44.946 --> 01:49:48.009]  This is an attempt by the CIA to basically take over
[01:49:48.029 --> 01:49:48.630]  Are you?
[01:50:04.369 --> 01:50:08.732]  Well, since when is a no-fly zone British Special Forces backing Al-Qaeda rebels?
[01:50:35.485 --> 01:50:38.889]  Ah, well, it was just like Iraq under Clinton.
[01:50:39.409 --> 01:50:49.560]  No-fly zone over Iraq and we had all kinds of special forces going in, penetrating the border through the Kurdish no-fly zone area to get Saddam Hussein.
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:52.923]  This is the same playbook being used all over again.
[01:50:53.894 --> 01:50:54.814]  What's the endgame?
[01:50:54.854 --> 01:50:56.295]  We'll talk about that straight ahead.
[01:50:56.435 --> 01:50:57.435]  Why are they doing this?
[01:50:57.755 --> 01:50:58.656]  Then Fukushima.
[01:50:59.116 --> 01:50:59.916]  Then your calls.
[01:51:00.076 --> 01:51:00.436]  Wayne Metz.
[01:51:00.456 --> 01:51:01.657]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.717 --> 01:51:07.058]  Did you know that the Global Elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.278 --> 01:51:08.879]  Did you know that in a real meltdown...
[01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:11.921]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:51:12.301 --> 01:51:12.701]  It's true.
[01:51:12.781 --> 01:51:15.363]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:15.603 --> 01:51:17.404]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:17.884 --> 01:51:22.587]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.107 --> 01:51:25.028]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:25.428 --> 01:51:30.031]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.231 --> 01:51:31.131]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:34.113]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.393 --> 01:51:37.695]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.015 --> 01:51:40.857]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.197 --> 01:51:43.098]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:43.418 --> 01:51:44.299]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.379 --> 01:51:44.679]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.699 --> 01:51:47.500]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.741]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:59.947 --> 01:52:06.110]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:02.851]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:53:03.231 --> 01:53:10.553]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:53:11.073 --> 01:53:15.094]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:53:15.614 --> 01:53:16.695]  It is glutathione.
[01:53:17.055 --> 01:53:20.716]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:53:21.116 --> 01:53:24.477]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:53:25.117 --> 01:53:30.421]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:53:30.901 --> 01:53:37.626]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:38.146 --> 01:53:42.970]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:53:44.571 --> 01:53:46.635]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:53:46.975 --> 01:53:47.356]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:47.376 --> 01:53:47.596]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:53:48.898 --> 01:53:50.040]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:54:06.351 --> 01:54:09.395]  Okay, callers, Wayne's going to stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:09.435 --> 01:54:10.476]  We'll get into Fukushima.
[01:54:10.937 --> 01:54:12.178]  We'll take your phone calls.
[01:54:12.999 --> 01:54:19.908]  Webster Tarbley, who called all of this with precision three years ago, is going to be on with us at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:21.530]  Doctor of history.
[01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:23.352]  He's also an economist.
[01:54:24.333 --> 01:54:27.036]  Um, Wayne's website is WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:54:27.096 --> 01:54:30.080]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.322]  Don't forget, we're also listener-supported.

[01:54:38.769 --> 01:54:40.190]  Didn't officially come out until today.
[01:54:40.771 --> 01:54:46.113]  We've been shipping since last week, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, an excellent new book by Mark Dice.
[01:54:46.413 --> 01:54:49.274]  We're the sole place to get this powerful book.
[01:54:49.694 --> 01:54:54.296]  We have a discount on some of my films as well at InfoWars.com.

[01:55:06.941 --> 01:55:08.982]  Wayne, getting back to Tripoli.
[01:55:10.066 --> 01:55:11.547]  And getting back to this new U.N.
[01:55:11.607 --> 01:55:12.667]  precedent where the U.N.
[01:55:12.687 --> 01:55:20.711]  gives an order and NATO and America jumps, obviously because it's their puppet they created to have this illusion of international solidarity.
[01:55:20.751 --> 01:55:28.674]  But it's the Security Council doing this, not outside nations, you know, the 160 plus that aren't part of the Security Council.
[01:55:28.714 --> 01:55:37.178]  But having those ground invasion ships, those amphibious delivery systems off the coast with tens of thousands of troops,
[01:55:38.098 --> 01:55:50.131]  Having Hillary say, and Obama say, you will submit to us, you will allow an international aid force in, which means the military, or else, they're basically gearing up for an invasion, a ground invasion.
[01:55:50.392 --> 01:55:51.213]  Do you disagree with that?
[01:55:52.392 --> 01:56:01.002]  Well, obviously, if they've got these troops ships off the coast with Marines, that's a real contingency that they're considering.
[01:56:01.083 --> 01:56:07.410]  And it seems like even Secretary of Defense Gates may have been overruled on this, believe that or not.
[01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:10.394]  I mean, he's a holdover from the Bush administration, but he was
[01:56:10.894 --> 01:56:12.856]  Never too keen on this operation.
[01:56:13.938 --> 01:56:19.284]  I think he of all people know how thin US forces are spread right now.
[01:56:19.324 --> 01:56:20.805]  We're in Afghanistan.
[01:56:20.846 --> 01:56:21.566]  We're in Iraq.
[01:56:21.626 --> 01:56:23.989]  We've got this covert war in Pakistan.
[01:56:24.029 --> 01:56:25.371]  We've been involved with Yemen.
[01:56:26.071 --> 01:56:26.811]  And now Libya.
[01:56:42.117 --> 01:56:45.860]  In the Pentagon who said, listen, we're going to invade Iraq.
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:47.542]  He said, what do you mean Iraq?
[01:56:48.182 --> 01:56:48.783]  What's going on?
[01:56:48.803 --> 01:56:51.585]  He said, well, there's a plan that we're going to go into Iraq.
[01:56:51.905 --> 01:56:53.246]  We're going to go into Syria.
[01:56:53.286 --> 01:56:54.828]  We're going to go into Libya.
[01:56:55.128 --> 01:56:56.649]  And there was a couple other countries.
[01:56:56.729 --> 01:56:58.571]  And eventually we're going to go into Iran.
[01:56:59.311 --> 01:57:05.073]  So it seems like whoever this guy was who told Clark this was on the money also.
[01:57:05.333 --> 01:57:13.076]  And we see Obama just carrying out this same plan that was hatched by the neocons under George W. Bush.
[01:57:14.957 --> 01:57:16.917]  You're absolutely on target again, Wayne.
[01:57:17.157 --> 01:57:22.099]  And under this new precedent, if people rebel, then the West invades.
[01:57:22.539 --> 01:57:24.020]  That's pointed right at Iran.
[01:57:25.518 --> 01:57:40.521]  Oh, I think Iran is, and I think what's happening now in Bahrain, where you have a majority Shia population, you had the king of Bahrain now try to justify his bloody crackdown on the opposition by saying, well, Iran was involved.
[01:57:40.541 --> 01:57:43.522]  Well, he didn't say, he said, outside parties.
[01:57:43.562 --> 01:57:53.464]  Well, we know he's talking about, and they had the Saudi troops come across the causeway bridge into Bahrain, and just, there's videos of them just shooting
[01:57:53.524 --> 01:57:53.744]  I don't
[01:58:10.037 --> 01:58:12.578]  Clinton talking about that, or Barack Obama.
[01:58:12.598 --> 01:58:16.999]  Barack Obama was in Brazil as this military action was launched.
[01:58:17.039 --> 01:58:25.422]  Brazil voted against, well, they basically abstained in the Security Council on this resolution.
[01:58:25.462 --> 01:58:26.742]  All right, Wayne, we got a break.
[01:58:26.762 --> 01:58:27.262]  Stay there.
[01:58:27.282 --> 01:58:29.103]  When we come back, we're going to start taking calls.
[01:58:29.123 --> 01:58:33.124]  But then later, in the next 20 minutes, I'm going to bring up the biggest issue yet.
[01:58:33.564 --> 01:58:36.345]  They're saying Gaddafi's probably going to launch terror attacks.
[01:58:36.685 --> 01:58:39.406]  Will the globalists launch a false flag to legitimize the war?
[01:58:41.812 --> 01:58:45.433]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:22.101 --> 02:00:23.141]  It is Monday.
[02:00:23.201 --> 02:00:24.061]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:24.141 --> 02:00:32.823]  More on the ongoing, unfolding crisis in Fukushima that's still intensifying, but the media is trying to make everybody forget about it.
[02:00:33.783 --> 02:00:54.532]  By focusing on Libya, the Daily Mail is reporting Colonel Qaddafi's son killed in a kamikaze pilot attack on Tripoli barracks, but we don't know if any of that's true because so much information is put out as war propaganda by the British, like Qaddafi racing to Venezuela or running to Zimbabwe or being killed.
[02:00:55.093 --> 02:00:58.114]  We've heard it all, but it is certainly intensifying.
[02:00:58.634 --> 02:01:00.095]  Also, the report talks about
[02:01:00.675 --> 02:01:04.877]  Rebel fighters finding any Qaddafi supporters, tying their hands and killing them.
[02:01:05.217 --> 02:01:06.818]  But that's humanitarian and good.
[02:01:07.338 --> 02:01:08.819]  Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[02:01:08.839 --> 02:01:18.083]  We're going to get into the big issue after the break, before we go to more calls, dealing with USI's terror response by Qaddafi.
[02:01:18.183 --> 02:01:19.664]  Perfect to legitimize the war.
[02:01:20.344 --> 02:01:21.925]  Perfect to have domestic crackdowns.
[02:01:22.967 --> 02:01:24.348]  Perfect to get approval ratings up.
[02:01:24.548 --> 02:01:25.868]  We'll talk to Wayne about that coming up.
[02:01:25.888 --> 02:01:29.730]  But right now, calls for Wayne Madsen, who joins us via video Skype from D.C.
[02:01:30.170 --> 02:01:31.571]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[02:01:31.591 --> 02:01:33.732]  Hello Alex and Wayne.
[02:01:34.793 --> 02:01:39.635]  I would like to make a very short statement and then get your comments if you would please give them.
[02:01:40.510 --> 02:01:45.215]  Um, we're at a point now where it's not humanly possible to back this evil down.
[02:01:45.275 --> 02:01:53.824]  That's my firm opinion and I believe that even more so because God himself has said, the God of creation has said, that without him we can do nothing.
[02:01:54.605 --> 02:02:02.650]  And do you believe that there's any way outside of relying upon God through a sincere repentance for our national... No, Mark, I agree with you.
[02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:07.753]  We've got to change our hearts and then God will lift us up as vessels to expose evil.
[02:02:08.013 --> 02:02:13.336]  That's why the globalists sell us on torture and corruption, because they know it makes us morally weak.
[02:02:13.396 --> 02:02:14.297]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:14.617 --> 02:02:15.878]  Comments on that, Wayne Madsen.
[02:02:17.088 --> 02:02:19.570]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, can anything be done?
[02:02:19.791 --> 02:02:25.516]  Saturday I was at an anti-war demonstration at Lafayette Park across from the White House, and this is what I saw.
[02:02:28.399 --> 02:02:35.185]  The first time I saw all this in Washington, I know under Bush it happened in other locations.
[02:02:35.205 --> 02:02:37.127]  Yeah, they arrested him for not having a permit.
[02:02:38.688 --> 02:02:47.771]  They did, and they kettled, and the cops kettled everyone into a fenced-in area, and if you didn't get out of that area like I did, you were subject to arrest and a $500 fine.
[02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:49.991]  Daniel Ellsberg was one of them.
[02:02:50.071 --> 02:02:58.794]  Some people knew they were going to be arrested, but they used the mounted police, mounted horses, kettled everyone into this fenced-in area.
[02:02:59.394 --> 02:03:05.295]  Yeah, and the tourists and there was a couple anti-Qaddafi protests.
[02:03:05.315 --> 02:03:07.776]  All those people, 9-11 Truth was there.
[02:03:08.536 --> 02:03:13.257]  All those people, if they stayed in the Kettledon area, they risked arrest.
[02:03:13.297 --> 02:03:16.378]  So everybody was forced to leave who didn't want to be arrested.
[02:03:16.478 --> 02:03:20.959]  I did not see that kind of activity under Bush, but I saw it under Obama.
[02:03:21.019 --> 02:03:25.380]  So when it comes to exercising your freedom,
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:32.182]  Free speech rights, freedom of assembly, it does not apply at Lafayette Square.
[02:03:32.202 --> 02:03:41.045]  And it crossed my mind, what I don't think they want to have happen on Pennsylvania Avenue and Lafayette Park is a Tahrir Square.
[02:03:41.105 --> 02:03:48.087]  And this was a clear indication, if we ever tried to have a Tahrir Square in Washington in front of the White House, it would be put down.
[02:03:49.253 --> 02:03:52.516]  You know, it would be put down as fast as anything.
[02:03:52.536 --> 02:04:12.153]  Well, Wayne, that was my next point, is that no protest zones, you can't protest in the park in Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, but then Egypt allowed the protests to go on and that was evil and horrible because they didn't hand the government over to the mob because the West wanted it.
[02:04:12.573 --> 02:04:15.536]  I mean, this is an illustration of the tyrants that run our country.
[02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:18.050]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:04:18.630 --> 02:04:29.832]  And you know, I remember under Bush we had probably between 250,000 and 300,000 anti-war demonstrators.
[02:04:29.852 --> 02:04:31.713]  Wayne, I've got to stop here.
[02:04:31.753 --> 02:04:33.493]  Skype is unintelligible.
[02:04:33.873 --> 02:04:37.034]  We're going to try to reconnect, or we may just go to phone with Wayne Madsen.
[02:04:37.074 --> 02:04:42.435]  It's great technology to be able to have him with us here on PrisonPlanet.tv and streaming to all the radio stations, but we're going to
[02:04:43.095 --> 02:04:44.256]  Fiddle with that during the break.
[02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:45.957]  Maybe go audio only over his Skype.
[02:04:46.417 --> 02:04:47.498]  Try to fix that breakup.
[02:04:47.518 --> 02:04:53.742]  And then we'll continue with Tim, Ben, JB, Ronnie, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:04:54.062 --> 02:04:58.145]  We'll also get more on Wayne's take on the whole Fukushima unfolding cover-up.
[02:04:58.505 --> 02:04:59.726]  Now out of sight, out of mind.
[02:04:59.946 --> 02:05:04.189]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.489 --> 02:05:05.089]  Number 1.
[02:05:05.409 --> 02:05:08.551]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.832 --> 02:05:09.392]  Number 2.
[02:05:09.692 --> 02:05:14.255]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.575 --> 02:05:15.036]  It's true.
[02:05:15.316 --> 02:05:19.899]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.199 --> 02:05:20.739]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.019 --> 02:05:24.301]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:24.602 --> 02:05:28.324]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.504 --> 02:05:29.065]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.305 --> 02:05:31.667]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.067 --> 02:05:35.451]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.751 --> 02:05:35.951]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.532 --> 02:05:40.455]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:40.695 --> 02:05:45.460]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:05:49.904 --> 02:05:51.466]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.686 --> 02:05:53.768]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:06:00.965 --> 02:06:07.649]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:06:07.989 --> 02:06:10.230]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:06:10.671 --> 02:06:19.476]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:06:19.716 --> 02:06:27.600]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:06:27.961 --> 02:06:28.541]  Move quickly!
[02:06:28.581 --> 02:06:28.921]  I think so.
[02:06:59.384 --> 02:07:00.524]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:00.564 --> 02:07:07.247]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:07.487 --> 02:07:09.788]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:10.048 --> 02:07:15.210]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:18.211]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:18.471 --> 02:07:20.572]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:20.792 --> 02:07:26.715]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:27.035 --> 02:07:30.236]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:30.416 --> 02:07:35.939]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:36.199 --> 02:07:37.519]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.040]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:41.681]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:41.821 --> 02:07:43.242]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:07:43.502 --> 02:07:45.866]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:46.026 --> 02:07:50.533]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:50.653 --> 02:07:53.116]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:53.237 --> 02:07:56.962]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:57.122 --> 02:07:58.124]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:08:04.861 --> 02:08:09.162]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:09.682 --> 02:08:10.503]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.283 --> 02:08:12.263]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:12.803 --> 02:08:16.464]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.005 --> 02:08:21.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.846 --> 02:08:34.250]  We've been talking about all the different facets of the globalist destabilization program in the Middle East with investigative journalists, formerly with the National Security Agency, Wayne Madsen.
[02:08:36.892 --> 02:08:45.240]  And we're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment and segue and get his take on the Fukushima unfolding crisis that's worsening right now.
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:51.125]  The press reports show, but it's not the big news item now because everybody loves a new war.
[02:08:51.165 --> 02:08:51.966]  It's so entertaining.
[02:08:52.526 --> 02:08:59.228]  And makes a lot of men out there feel good about themselves through the New World Order that controls our country and that is bankrupting us.
[02:08:59.409 --> 02:09:00.449]  There's a lot of high-fiving.
[02:09:00.469 --> 02:09:05.091]  A lot of people are watching it at bars and they're not watching sports right now.
[02:09:05.311 --> 02:09:08.812]  They're very, very excited and feeling powerful through this mass murder.
[02:09:09.152 --> 02:09:12.413]  They're also celebrating and feeling very proud about photos of U.S.
[02:09:12.473 --> 02:09:14.714]  kill teams with dead children that they pose with.
[02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:16.875]  This is our journey into evil.
[02:09:18.305 --> 02:09:21.266]  Very sick to see America turned into a instrument of the globalists.
[02:09:21.986 --> 02:09:23.887]  But this London Telegraph article came out Sunday.
[02:09:23.927 --> 02:09:25.347]  We also wrote about it before they did.
[02:09:25.407 --> 02:09:26.227]  I'm proud of that fact.
[02:09:26.647 --> 02:09:26.867]  U.S.
[02:09:26.907 --> 02:09:30.568]  government backs Libyan al-Qaeda while hyping terror attacks inside U.S.
[02:09:31.389 --> 02:09:32.449]  Here's London Telegraph.
[02:09:32.489 --> 02:09:34.409]  The West and al-Qaeda on the same side.
[02:09:34.429 --> 02:09:37.290]  CNN also ran a similar headline.
[02:09:38.191 --> 02:09:42.832]  But the big issue came out today, and they're certainly pushing this now, Wayne.
[02:09:43.832 --> 02:09:56.982]  USI's Qaddafi terror response, and if they have indeed killed one of his sons as they killed his daughter decades ago, he might actually do something which then allows them to, in the minds of people, how dare him fight back!
[02:09:57.042 --> 02:09:57.703]  That's terror!
[02:09:58.964 --> 02:10:00.865]  Then launch a ground invasion.
[02:10:00.885 --> 02:10:04.588]  That's why they're so arrogant and full of bravado right now in my view.
[02:10:05.649 --> 02:10:15.694]  The White House memos talk about how great a terror attack would be to boost overall police state approval ratings for the TSA who's on the ropes, the federal police state, the spy grid.
[02:10:16.314 --> 02:10:25.258]  I see it in the cards for them to stage a false flag or allow it to take place to try to bolster their expanded takeover.
[02:10:25.498 --> 02:10:26.779]  Wayne Madsen, your take on that?
[02:10:27.731 --> 02:10:30.072]  Well, I think it's hogwash.
[02:10:30.872 --> 02:10:36.094]  Qaddafi was linked to some terrorist groups, but we're talking about the 1980s.
[02:10:36.134 --> 02:10:45.738]  And of course, he was the bad guy du jour in those days, linked to the Irish Republican Army and the Basque terrorists.
[02:10:46.098 --> 02:10:51.880]  But he gave all these networks up in return for having this
[02:10:54.121 --> 02:10:58.904]  But what about the issue of the neocons staging a terror attack as an excuse to ground invade and to crack down domestically?
[02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:21.933]  Well, I think that's always a fear from the neocons.
[02:11:21.973 --> 02:11:23.854]  I mean, that's how they operate.
[02:11:23.894 --> 02:11:25.936]  That's their modus operandi.
[02:11:25.956 --> 02:11:30.159]  We've seen it time and time again in so many of these false flag attacks.
[02:11:31.019 --> 02:11:44.889]  So the mere thought that they're saying, well, Qaddafi may go the terrorist route, I think, is trying to lay the groundwork for that distinct possibility that we may see something happen in Europe or the United States.
[02:11:44.889 --> 02:11:45.289]  Exactly.
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:05.041]  And folks, it's been declassified that our criminal government stages terror attacks on a routine basis.
[02:12:05.061 --> 02:12:05.841]  That is a fact.
[02:12:06.301 --> 02:12:09.102]  One of the chief ones, Gulf of Tonkin, to get us into Vietnam.
[02:12:09.562 --> 02:12:11.383]  Let's talk to Tim in Washington.
[02:12:11.403 --> 02:12:13.363]  No, no, Marshall in Texas is first.
[02:12:13.723 --> 02:12:15.264]  Marshall in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:12:15.284 --> 02:12:17.124]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:12:17.244 --> 02:12:24.846]  I just want to bring up, you spoke earlier on in the show, when you spoke of Libya, that they were going under the guise of humanitarianism.
[02:12:25.396 --> 02:12:38.119]  This might set the precedent for them to do so here under unrest, whether it be the government creating the unrest and coming down on us, or whether it be just to set the precedent that they need to be the ones coming in so that this doesn't happen.
[02:12:39.379 --> 02:12:41.779]  Well, we saw what happened yesterday in Lafayette Park.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:47.481]  Peaceful pro-war and anti-war protesters kettled and arrested en masse.
[02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:50.941]  No protest allowed in America.
[02:12:51.001 --> 02:12:53.122]  The very tyranny they're decrying in Libya.
[02:12:53.162 --> 02:12:53.742]  Wayne Madsen.
[02:12:54.895 --> 02:12:55.895]  Well, absolutely.
[02:12:56.736 --> 02:13:01.057]  Talk about going into a country under the guise of humanitarian assistance.
[02:13:01.117 --> 02:13:02.878]  Remember, when George H.W.
[02:13:02.918 --> 02:13:11.901]  Bush was a lame-duck president at the end of 1992, he went into Somalia, supposedly, for humanitarian purposes.
[02:13:12.261 --> 02:13:25.647]  And then when Bill Clinton became president, he decides he's going to start to do nation building, which we saw 18 US Army Rangers killed in Mogadishu as a result of that entirely messed up operation.
[02:13:25.967 --> 02:13:27.827]  Now, we've been there before.
[02:13:28.128 --> 02:13:29.128]  We went into Haiti.
[02:13:29.588 --> 02:13:32.609]  I don't know how many times, quote unquote, for humanitarian missions.
[02:13:32.649 --> 02:13:33.210]  It isn't funny.
[02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:41.636]  Obama, he had no problem with Baby Doc going back to Haiti, but he didn't want the rightful president who was ousted in a U.S.
[02:13:41.736 --> 02:13:49.101]  coup, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, returning from exile imposed by the United States and France and South Africa.
[02:13:49.702 --> 02:13:53.124]  So we have humanitarian... look, U.S.
[02:13:53.244 --> 02:13:55.226]  Agency for International Development
[02:13:55.666 --> 02:13:56.646]  Thank you, Marshall.
[02:14:13.693 --> 02:14:25.480]  I want to go to Tim, Ben, and JB and others here, and then we'll keep you to the bottom of the hour before our next guest, because I want to spend that next little five-minute segment on the reactor continual meltdown that's happening.
[02:14:25.781 --> 02:14:34.886]  But in your gut, Wayne, watching this for a long time, reporting from Capitol Hill, calling a lot of things before they happen, in your gut, how do you see this ending?
[02:14:34.926 --> 02:14:37.888]  What are the different scenarios, and what do you think most probable among them?
[02:14:39.033 --> 02:14:43.296]  Well, I think what we're going to see is a U.S.
[02:14:43.376 --> 02:14:51.461]  military, U.S., British, French, and some Italian military involvement in what is essentially now a civil war in Libya.
[02:14:51.842 --> 02:14:56.465]  I think we're going to see a pro-U.S.
[02:14:56.545 --> 02:14:59.727]  Western government installed, at least in Benghazi.
[02:15:00.808 --> 02:15:03.269]  I don't know how long Qaddafi can hold on.
[02:15:03.289 --> 02:15:07.152]  There are reports that he had mercenaries from other countries.
[02:15:07.472 --> 02:15:14.157]  So basically, the globalist-backed forces started losing, and so the big air power came in to back them.
[02:15:38.502 --> 02:15:40.863]  Yeah, and I think they've got a lot of Ahmed Chalabi.
[02:15:40.903 --> 02:15:46.966]  You know, he's a guy we put in Iraq, sort of an international con artist and crook.
[02:15:47.046 --> 02:15:53.348]  We've got a lot of Libyans who have lived outside of Libya for a number of years in London and Washington and elsewhere.
[02:15:53.388 --> 02:16:04.453]  I think we're probably going to see an attempt to put one of those characters in charge in Libya, and he'll be every bit in our court as that puppet guy we have in Iraq right now.
[02:16:04.653 --> 02:16:08.355]  Well, and of course, Iraq's now one of the only Arab countries actually endorsing this.
[02:16:08.376 --> 02:16:10.957]  The Arab League and its support has fallen apart.
[02:16:10.977 --> 02:16:17.702]  They were all for a no-fly zone, but not for the bombardment and the special forces there on the ground.
[02:16:17.722 --> 02:16:20.484]  But I do see them trying to at least break the country in two.
[02:16:21.144 --> 02:16:26.227]  Right, well I think the rebels probably now that we've changed the game with the Tomahawk cruise missile, isn't that nice?
[02:16:26.247 --> 02:16:26.807]  The United States
[02:16:49.162 --> 02:16:51.944]  Jim in Washington, here on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:19.301]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:17:19.341 --> 02:17:39.721]  I had a couple points for you real fast, and I was just kind of curious on my math here, because according to my math at Chernobyl meltdown, for 10 days, with all the reactors compiled, we were looking at a total of 32 Chernobyl days so far in Fukushima, due to its rate of... Most of the physicists and doctors we've had on have said
[02:17:40.382 --> 02:17:49.178]  That this is bigger than Chernobyl, and that there's been a whole bunch, it was four reactors with partial meltdowns, 600,000 plus spent fuel rods sprayed everywhere.
[02:17:49.578 --> 02:17:50.720]  Wayne, what's your take on this?
[02:17:51.929 --> 02:18:04.778]  Well, I think obviously we know that just like with Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, what we're getting is being downplayed by the politicians and the nuclear, the very powerful nuclear power industry.
[02:18:04.818 --> 02:18:14.805]  This is a very, very powerful lobby because unlike other energy lobbies, they have to deal with the government to get the nuclear material to start these plans.
[02:18:14.845 --> 02:18:19.748]  So there's already a too close of a relationship between the industry and the government.
[02:18:20.669 --> 02:18:20.949]  I think
[02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:26.552]  Basically, what I'm hearing from people in Japan, it is much worse.
[02:18:26.932 --> 02:18:34.876]  Of course, the Japanese broadcaster NHK is run by the government and they've been downplaying a lot of this also.
[02:18:35.556 --> 02:18:41.059]  But the private media is telling me that it is much worse.
[02:18:41.559 --> 02:18:45.501]  We're talking about the Tokyo metropolitan region, Tokyo, Yokohama.
[02:18:45.781 --> 02:18:46.721]  People are now leaving.
[02:18:46.761 --> 02:18:49.983]  The Swiss embassy has moved the embassy from Tokyo to Osaka.
[02:18:50.163 --> 02:18:51.104]  So has the U.S.
[02:18:51.144 --> 02:18:51.684]  military.
[02:18:51.744 --> 02:18:54.166]  What does that tell you about how serious this really is?
[02:18:54.846 --> 02:18:56.007]  That it's very serious.
[02:18:56.027 --> 02:19:01.210]  And they're telling us the fallout's no big deal on the West Coast when the real radiation hasn't even gotten here yet.
[02:19:02.324 --> 02:19:04.565]  Well, and we've had our politicians tell us that.
[02:19:04.885 --> 02:19:11.989]  Three Mile Island, 1979, Governor Thornburg of Pennsylvania stated, he said, there's no problem.
[02:19:12.009 --> 02:19:20.454]  He waited three days before telling pregnant women around Three Mile Island that it's time for you to evacuate when he knew how bad it was three days prior.
[02:19:20.514 --> 02:19:22.615]  So we've seen this play out so many times.
[02:19:23.075 --> 02:19:28.358]  Chernobyl, the cover-up by the Soviet government, helped lead to their demise because they covered that up.
[02:19:28.718 --> 02:19:39.443]  But anytime we see these reactor incidents, and well, now we know TEPCO was fudging on the safety inspections because TEPCO is very close to the government oversight.
[02:19:39.623 --> 02:19:40.043]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:19:40.063 --> 02:19:41.364]  We're going to come right back to that.
[02:19:41.424 --> 02:19:43.685]  Do you have anything else to add, Tim, in Washington?
[02:19:44.665 --> 02:19:46.348]  Yes, I got a couple other things, if you don't mind.
[02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:47.210]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:48.512]  Tim, straight ahead.
[02:19:48.532 --> 02:19:49.854]  We'll try to cram in a few others.
[02:19:50.335 --> 02:19:52.319]  And we'll continue with the calls when Tarpley joins us as well.
[02:19:52.439 --> 02:19:54.582]  One more segment with Wayne Madsen.
[02:19:54.703 --> 02:19:56.586]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[02:21:30.576 --> 02:21:34.939]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.139 --> 02:21:40.823]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:40.923 --> 02:21:44.345]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:22:12.687 --> 02:22:18.973]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:19.093 --> 02:22:21.315]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:22:21.855 --> 02:22:22.135]  Tim Geithner?
[02:22:22.155 --> 02:22:22.596]  Bernanke?
[02:22:22.676 --> 02:22:23.136]  They're arsonists!
[02:22:23.156 --> 02:22:24.097]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:24.438 --> 02:22:26.860]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:40.734 --> 02:22:42.575]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:42.875 --> 02:22:47.659]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:24:11.938 --> 02:24:14.519]  Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm.
[02:24:14.659 --> 02:24:15.820]  Many days we go into overdrive.
[02:24:16.621 --> 02:24:17.341]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:24:17.361 --> 02:24:18.982]  11 a.m.
[02:24:19.022 --> 02:24:19.443]  to 2 p.m.
[02:24:19.483 --> 02:24:19.943]  Central.
[02:24:21.123 --> 02:24:23.145]  Here's the headline at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:24.165 --> 02:24:25.106]  It just went live.
[02:24:25.626 --> 02:24:27.707]  Let's send Ann Coulter to Fukushima.
[02:24:28.467 --> 02:24:30.368]  I was going to play the clip, but we're almost out of time.
[02:24:30.428 --> 02:24:34.130]  I may play it later and tease Tarpley, a big nuclear power fan.
[02:24:34.791 --> 02:24:39.934]  But Human Events has the headline, A Glowing Report on Radiation by Ann Coulter.
[02:24:40.834 --> 02:24:46.940]  Anyone exposed to excess radiation from the nuclear power plants is now probably much less likely to get cancer.
[02:24:47.661 --> 02:24:53.406]  I guess her thought is you aim it directly at a cancer, it hurts that cell, that group of abnormal cells.
[02:24:53.426 --> 02:25:00.012]  But general radiation of the whole body in every major study is, I mean, that's not even debated, massively increases cancer.
[02:25:00.032 --> 02:25:02.314]  I mean, even our own government estimates a million deaths.
[02:25:02.975 --> 02:25:05.697]  In the 25 years associated with Chernobyl.
[02:25:06.158 --> 02:25:11.302]  But, I mean, this is just brazen propaganda saying the radiation is good for you, Wayne Madsen.
[02:25:12.623 --> 02:25:16.606]  Well, you know, Ann Coulter, have you noticed she hasn't really been on the news recently?
[02:25:16.646 --> 02:25:24.473]  So she had to say, he, she, he, whatever that is, had to say something to get back into the news cycle.
[02:25:24.533 --> 02:25:28.936]  And the more outrageous, of course, that's how, that's what the Fox News is all about.
[02:25:29.377 --> 02:25:30.798]  The more outrageous, the better.
[02:25:31.038 --> 02:25:33.542]  Well, I don't like to interrupt in the time we've got.
[02:25:33.562 --> 02:25:37.487]  I don't like to be mean about how somebody looks because, I mean, I'm not the most beautiful person on the planet.
[02:25:37.908 --> 02:25:46.920]  But at the 2004 Republican convention, I was going in the front entrance and waiting for some people and saw her walking in and I was actually scared.
[02:25:47.481 --> 02:25:49.282]  Yeah, I mean, no, no, no, I'm not joking.
[02:25:49.382 --> 02:26:05.867]  I was repulsed because she's so anorexic, you don't see it on TV because it adds weight, that she was having trouble walking, and she looked like a concentration camp victim, like a skull with skin on it, painted with lipstick, and she was actually toddling in like a undead.
[02:26:05.927 --> 02:26:06.927]  No, I was like, ugh!
[02:26:06.947 --> 02:26:10.868]  I mean, my actual, I've never run into anybody that made me go, ugh!
[02:26:10.929 --> 02:26:12.069]  And actually take a breath in.
[02:26:13.379 --> 02:26:24.162]  Yeah, well, maybe that's because she's so emaciated, we think that's an Adam's apple, maybe her thorax, I don't know, but the larynx.
[02:26:24.842 --> 02:26:36.646]  But I just don't understand people, you know, the broadcaster is supposed to serve the common interest, the public good, and that's definitely not, that doesn't serve any public good.
[02:26:37.266 --> 02:26:39.527]  But one thing I'm hearing from people in Japan is,
[02:26:40.427 --> 02:26:43.969]  It's no good to send money because they have money, they can't buy anything with it.
[02:26:44.029 --> 02:26:50.632]  So what they have, nothing, off the shelves now in Tokyo and Yokohama, the ramen noodles.
[02:26:50.692 --> 02:26:57.595]  So if anybody has friends, family, colleagues over there, this is, you know, small packages so it's not held up in customs.
[02:26:58.435 --> 02:27:04.998]  Those ramen noodles, powdered milk, triple A, double A batteries, this is what they're out of and this is what they're...
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:10.241]  Now, this is the third largest economy in the world.
[02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:19.767]  China, of course, just surpassed them as the second largest, but this is what can happen to an infrastructure when they have a triple disaster like they've experienced.
[02:27:20.087 --> 02:27:29.793]  In closing, Wayne, give us your summation of how bad the disaster really is, the radiation cover-up, and the fact that they're saying this could go on for weeks or months.
[02:27:30.593 --> 02:27:34.896]  Headlines about the relief not going well, reactors still smoking, burning.
[02:27:42.518 --> 02:27:44.019]  Well, this is what I understand.
[02:27:44.059 --> 02:27:50.721]  The Chief Cabinet Secretary, Adama, he cut his teeth politically as an anti-nuclear activist.
[02:27:50.781 --> 02:27:57.983]  So, what I'm hearing is that there are people in TEPCO and the Nuclear Oversight Agency who don't want to tell him a lot.
[02:27:58.423 --> 02:27:59.164]  What's going on?
[02:27:59.224 --> 02:28:06.829]  Because they're afraid he's going to amplify it and make it sound much, well, it is worse than what they're saying, but they don't necessarily trust him.
[02:28:07.149 --> 02:28:09.310]  And that's why he's not getting the full picture.
[02:28:09.611 --> 02:28:13.753]  And he's the public face of the Japanese government at all these news conferences.
[02:28:13.793 --> 02:28:28.023]  So there is a willful attempt by the TEPCO and the nuclear oversight people in Japan to keep critical information, the worst case information from members of the government, including the Chief Cabinet Secretary.
[02:28:28.503 --> 02:28:30.405]  Well, it's not a good sign when the U.S.
[02:28:30.465 --> 02:28:31.465]  military, U.S.
[02:28:31.545 --> 02:28:51.100]  embassies, French, German pull out, when foreign airlines won't fly into Tokyo, when the fleet raced away last Monday when Fukushima 3 blew up, and now when the head of the plant itself breaks down and cries and says, basically, I can't lie to you, this radiation is going to kill people, that shows you what's really happening.
[02:28:52.552 --> 02:29:08.504]  Right, and we have to be worried here about the radiation that's coming over the West Coast because we know that based on what we saw with the Gulf oil disaster, how our own government downplays the health effects of these natural disasters.
[02:29:08.844 --> 02:29:16.310]  The other thing I want to add quickly is I'm afraid we may see the international bankers, these vampires, vultures and vermin
[02:29:19.131 --> 02:29:30.613]  Meanwhile, a headline up at Drudge, also on InfoWars.com.
[02:29:31.033 --> 02:29:35.494]  White House works quietly to squelch the photos.
[02:29:35.974 --> 02:29:38.575]  They've already released photos of them killing kids.
[02:29:40.055 --> 02:29:42.235]  So, man, Wayne Madsen, thank you for joining us.
[02:29:42.775 --> 02:29:44.836]  We'll be right back with Dr. Tarpley.
[02:29:50.390 --> 02:29:53.393]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.315 --> 02:29:56.998]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.872 --> 02:30:05.513]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:05.833 --> 02:30:13.954]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:14.694 --> 02:30:18.735]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:19.335 --> 02:30:30.137]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:30.777 --> 02:30:39.785]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:40.286 --> 02:30:45.330]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:45.731 --> 02:30:52.897]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:53.217 --> 02:30:55.980]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:01.033 --> 02:31:04.657]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:05.057 --> 02:31:08.061]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:08.301 --> 02:31:13.086]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:13.106 --> 02:31:19.313]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:19.493 --> 02:31:21.736]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:22.256 --> 02:31:22.536]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:22.576 --> 02:31:22.996]  Bernanke?
[02:31:23.056 --> 02:31:23.396]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:23.416 --> 02:31:24.177]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:24.197 --> 02:31:25.877]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.161 --> 02:31:48.108]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:48.448 --> 02:31:57.557]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:59.585 --> 02:32:03.828]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.128 --> 02:32:04.409]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.049 --> 02:32:08.191]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:08.472 --> 02:32:09.032]  Number 2.
[02:32:09.332 --> 02:32:13.896]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.216 --> 02:32:14.676]  It's true.
[02:32:14.976 --> 02:32:19.520]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:20.380]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.661 --> 02:32:23.943]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.263 --> 02:32:27.946]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.146 --> 02:32:28.706]  Number 4.
[02:32:28.947 --> 02:32:31.308]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:35.091]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.392 --> 02:32:35.592]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.172 --> 02:32:40.095]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.335 --> 02:32:45.079]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:45.379 --> 02:32:49.405]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.545 --> 02:32:51.107]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:33:10.626 --> 02:33:34.338]  Take its toll if you could I think I'd switch and open your third eye You'd see that we should never be afraid to die Now rise up and take the power back It's time, fat cats had a heart attack You know that their time's coming to an end We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
[02:33:42.890 --> 02:33:46.973]  We're going to be talking to Webster Griffith-Tarpley on the North African situation.
[02:33:47.013 --> 02:33:50.154]  Really a fourth war, not a third as the media is calling it.
[02:33:50.635 --> 02:33:50.935]  U.S.
[02:33:51.055 --> 02:33:54.637]  Army kill team in Afghanistan posed for photos of murdered civilians.
[02:33:55.297 --> 02:33:58.279]  Der Spiegel is reporting that Obama is working behind the scenes.
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:03.761]  To try to suppress the photos and get them removed from Der Spiegel.
[02:34:03.781 --> 02:34:06.101]  Get them all up on Infowars.com guys right now.
[02:34:07.742 --> 02:34:09.122]  Just unbelievable photos.
[02:34:09.282 --> 02:34:22.525]  Look out if you don't want to see what looks like about a 10-year-old being who's been murdered in plain clothes and jogging shorts and a t-shirt with US troops posing over their
[02:34:23.365 --> 02:34:24.886]  They're white-tailed deer, I guess.
[02:34:24.926 --> 02:34:27.588]  They think that they've basically been hunting.
[02:34:28.549 --> 02:34:30.650]  This is the type of stuff that we're dealing with.
[02:34:30.690 --> 02:34:35.154]  And, of course, Der Spiegel's only releasing some of the least horrific photos.
[02:34:35.174 --> 02:34:38.576]  But we're going to be talking to Dr. Tarpley here in just a moment.
[02:34:39.417 --> 02:34:44.841]  Before I go any further, I want to thank some of the sponsors that make this broadcast possible.
[02:34:44.961 --> 02:34:51.886]  One of them is Diamond Gusset Jeans, celebrating 25 years of Made in America high-quality regular jeans and motorcycle jeans and other apparel.

[02:35:29.186 --> 02:35:31.508]  I believe in decentralized personal solar.
[02:35:31.548 --> 02:35:32.488]  I'm putting it in myself.
[02:35:32.909 --> 02:35:34.490]  High quality solar systems.
[02:35:34.930 --> 02:35:35.831]  Very inexpensive.
[02:35:35.851 --> 02:35:37.532]  Been sponsored for four years with this product.

[02:35:44.217 --> 02:35:44.977]  Very inexpensive.
[02:35:44.997 --> 02:35:45.718]  Very easy to use.
[02:35:45.738 --> 02:35:46.118]  877-327-0365.
[02:35:46.138 --> 02:35:46.838]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:35:46.898 --> 02:35:47.419]  And finally,
[02:35:54.864 --> 02:35:56.425]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:35:56.825 --> 02:36:01.866]  I want to tell you about this great Made in America line of whole house tabletop under the sink.
[02:36:02.266 --> 02:36:05.867]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit Purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:36:06.168 --> 02:36:07.888]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[02:36:07.908 --> 02:36:12.009]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:16.291]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water.
[02:36:17.091 --> 02:36:18.493]  Including shower and bath filters.
[02:36:18.853 --> 02:36:21.757]  All their filters are made in the USA, which will anger globalists.
[02:36:22.237 --> 02:36:27.964]  Check out their banners at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to take control of your water supply today.
[02:36:28.004 --> 02:36:33.011]  That's PureWaterFreedom.com or Gusset.com forward slash sale or MySolarBackup.com
[02:36:34.332 --> 02:36:38.114]  And also the purchase of books, videos, and t-shirts and the rest of it also funds our operation.
[02:36:38.474 --> 02:36:42.056]  If you believe in what we're doing, most revolutionaries rob banks and things to fund themselves.
[02:36:42.477 --> 02:36:43.437]  I know the founders did.
[02:36:43.457 --> 02:36:44.118]  I don't.
[02:36:44.658 --> 02:36:46.799]  I sell products, books, videos, things I believe in.
[02:36:47.259 --> 02:36:48.220]  And we hope you'll support us.
[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:54.964]  Going now to Webster Griffin Tarpley, who's written the unauthorized biography of Barack Obama, George Herbert Walker Bush,
[02:36:56.244 --> 02:37:13.448]  And who three years ago, before Obama even got in office, said this will be the kamikaze model of playing states off against each other, funding CIA, MI6 groups to try to overthrow the Muslim nations, because this has all been stated as their plan, then coming in with air power behind them to back them up.
[02:37:13.848 --> 02:37:18.229]  What does this signify that Germany and Turkey have broken away from NATO?
[02:37:18.589 --> 02:37:20.830]  What does it signify for the first time ever to have the UN
[02:37:21.811 --> 02:37:28.423]  Issue the order, and in less than 48 hours, about 26 hours, a tax could be launched with no congressional involvement.
[02:37:28.744 --> 02:37:30.467]  We're seeing some big moves here.
[02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:31.870]  What does it signify?
[02:37:32.251 --> 02:37:33.212]  Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:37:33.749 --> 02:37:58.070]  Well, I would say first of all that the fact that the NATO and Obama have had to use military force, they've had to bomb Libya back into the Stone Age with massacres of civilians, this is a defeat for them because their plan had been to use the model of the color revolution, the CIA people power coup, the National Endowment for Democracy push from behind the scenes,
[02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:59.071]  We're good to go.
[02:38:14.165 --> 02:38:14.986]  We're good to go.
[02:38:31.039 --> 02:38:33.223]  Now, Obama is obviously embarrassed.
[02:38:33.283 --> 02:38:38.090]  You can see the sneaky, cowardly way that Obama started this war.
[02:38:38.250 --> 02:38:44.179]  Obama does not have the guts to give an Oval Office speech and look the American people in the eye.
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:45.281]  Like George W. Bush did!
[02:38:46.222 --> 02:38:49.886]  Even George W. Bush was a very blunt aggressor.
[02:38:49.946 --> 02:38:53.108]  He was an imperialist aggressor, and he made no bones about it.
[02:38:53.208 --> 02:38:56.391]  And he looked you in the eye and said, I'm an imperialist aggressor.
[02:38:56.431 --> 02:38:58.173]  But with Obama, it's all deception.
[02:38:58.553 --> 02:39:00.275]  And we have this charade going on.
[02:39:00.595 --> 02:39:01.095]  The U.S.
[02:39:01.155 --> 02:39:03.638]  is obviously the leading edge of the attack.
[02:39:03.778 --> 02:39:10.724]  The 125 cruise missiles fired in the night between Saturday and Sunday, that's the main guts of this attack.
[02:39:11.264 --> 02:39:21.671]  But instead we have the British and the French in some way, in this charade, this dumb show, where they pretend to be the leading edge, and of course they're not.
[02:39:22.311 --> 02:39:32.098]  The French were able to get, I think, all of 15, 1-5 aircraft over Cyrenaic, over Libya, on Saturday.
[02:39:32.178 --> 02:39:34.099]  That's pathetic.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:35.520]  But the U.S.
[02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:37.502]  cruise missiles are the ones that are doing the work.
[02:39:38.022 --> 02:39:40.884]  And now I think what you're seeing, though, because of this attempt
[02:39:41.924 --> 02:39:49.908]  To have propaganda showing the British and the French in the lead, this is going to lead to military chaos in the command and control structure.
[02:39:49.928 --> 02:39:52.129]  Because you already have the following situation.
[02:39:52.509 --> 02:40:01.713]  The Italians say, we will not allow Britain and France to use these critical bases, Sigonella in Sicily and elsewhere.
[02:40:02.114 --> 02:40:05.555]  We want the NATO command to do this, because we're Italy.
[02:40:05.615 --> 02:40:06.796]  We're not subjected to
[02:40:07.396 --> 02:40:09.699]  Britain and France, we are part of NATO.
[02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:16.027]  But then the French say, no, we can't do that because we have these Arab puppet states that we want to participate.
[02:40:16.067 --> 02:40:19.230]  We have Qatar, the Al Jazeera base.
[02:40:19.311 --> 02:40:25.398]  And by the way, a lot of them are starting to back out right now and having reservations because of how bad it looks at home.
[02:40:25.638 --> 02:40:29.200]  Right, and that's in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
[02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:46.972]  Now, today in Cairo, we had a meeting of the Arab League, and of course this Amir Moussa, the head of the Arab League, had been out in front demanding a no-fly zone, but this is a guy who wants to be president of Egypt, and we can see that the Arab street, the Arab marketplace, is now turning against the U.S.
[02:40:47.433 --> 02:40:51.435]  once again, and against NATO, because of this massacre that's going on.
[02:40:51.575 --> 02:40:55.238]  And even if they don't like Gaddafi, you've got to root for the underdog.
[02:40:55.798 --> 02:41:00.902]  Well, they don't like imperialist aggression, and Qaddafi is looking better and better by the hour.
[02:41:01.282 --> 02:41:03.243]  We had Ban Ki-moon, the U.S.
[02:41:03.323 --> 02:41:04.905]  puppet who is the U.N.
[02:41:04.965 --> 02:41:05.825]  Secretary General.
[02:41:06.145 --> 02:41:15.952]  He wanted to go to Tahrir Square and strut and posture and preen himself as a hero of democracy, and the Egyptian protesters have finally done something good.
[02:41:16.293 --> 02:41:19.575]  The Egyptian protesters are finally fighting the imperialists.
[02:41:19.975 --> 02:41:26.958]  Instead of acting as their tools, they wouldn't let Ban Ki-moon make his triumphal tour of Tahrir Square.
[02:41:27.378 --> 02:41:29.919]  And as you mentioned, Germany was never in this.
[02:41:30.199 --> 02:41:32.120]  They have tremendous doubts.
[02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:34.701]  The Turks are not happy.
[02:41:34.921 --> 02:41:39.743]  The Italians are the least happy of all, but they're so weak that they don't know what to do.
[02:41:39.803 --> 02:41:42.004]  Interestingly, today, Putin says,
[02:41:43.445 --> 02:41:43.965]  The U.N.
[02:41:44.005 --> 02:41:50.411]  resolution is, in effect, a medieval call for a crusade against Libya.
[02:41:50.531 --> 02:41:52.694]  And Putin has drawn the lesson himself.
[02:41:52.734 --> 02:41:58.159]  He has ordered the doubling of Russian missile production so they can see the handwriting on the wall.
[02:41:58.539 --> 02:42:06.327]  Naturally, the fact that Russia and China did not veto this monstrosity last week in the United States... They abstained!
[02:42:07.328 --> 02:42:10.310]  This was not a profile in courage, to put it mildly.
[02:42:10.890 --> 02:42:12.312]  They could have stopped it, they shouldn't have stopped it.
[02:42:12.332 --> 02:42:13.553]  Well Webster, let me stop you there.
[02:42:13.793 --> 02:42:18.957]  Why are the globalists moving in such a naked way now?
[02:42:19.117 --> 02:42:20.758]  What is triggering this?
[02:42:21.099 --> 02:42:23.881]  It is the war on the nation state itself.
[02:42:24.201 --> 02:42:27.704]  If you look at Tarpley.net or my Twitter feed, Webster G. Tarpley,
[02:42:28.264 --> 02:42:36.968]  I go through this question of all the countries in the Middle East are looking for a way to get out of the Anglo-American plantation.
[02:42:37.008 --> 02:42:39.489]  They don't want to be subjected to the United States anymore.
[02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:44.432]  In order to do that, you've got to make a deal with Russia, which Saudi Arabia had been doing.
[02:42:44.732 --> 02:42:46.412]  You've got to make a deal with China.
[02:42:46.573 --> 02:42:51.335]  That was the path chosen by Algeria, by Pakistan.
[02:42:51.795 --> 02:42:55.997]  Or you make a deal with Iran, and that was what Mubarak had been doing, and many others.
[02:42:56.457 --> 02:43:05.459]  So, in order to get out of the empire, you've got to turn to some other power source, and that basically comes down to Russia, China, and to some degree, Iran.
[02:43:05.779 --> 02:43:14.721]  The US-British answer to that is, well, if we can't control these puppet states anymore, these satraps or viceroys of our empire, we will destroy them.
[02:43:15.141 --> 02:43:16.682]  So you can see what they're going for.
[02:43:17.022 --> 02:43:22.703]  Sudan has been carved into two parts, mainly to prevent the Chinese from getting the oil in South Sudan.
[02:43:22.743 --> 02:43:24.184]  That's their bare minimum in Libya.
[02:43:24.204 --> 02:43:25.844]  They want to break it with their group in the east.
[02:43:26.525 --> 02:43:37.157]  And breaking it in this case means, in the case of Libya, it means an attempted return to tribalism with the tribes of Cyrenaica against the tribes of Tripolitania, the east against the west.
[02:43:37.197 --> 02:43:40.420]  So that's the post-industrial tribal balkanization model?
[02:43:41.021 --> 02:43:44.947]  Tribalism, call it warlords, it's the destruction of the nation-state.
[02:43:44.967 --> 02:43:51.976]  So, in effect, if you want to defend human civilization, you have to take your stand in defense of the modern nation-state.
[02:43:52.357 --> 02:43:54.640]  Not with the secessionists, you can see what it is, right?
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:56.663]  The guys in Cyrenaica are the secessionists.
[02:43:57.043 --> 02:43:59.524]  Yemen is being carved on the north-south axis.
[02:43:59.945 --> 02:44:13.511]  Pakistan, the whole goal of that guy Ray Davis there, that he's accused by the Pakistanis of being a terrorist controller dealing in nuclear materials for a radiological... But what triggered them to do something this dangerous?
[02:44:15.252 --> 02:44:20.215]  You've always said as the dollar starts to die, they were going to start a war to basically threaten everybody.
[02:44:20.615 --> 02:44:26.219]  Well, if you look, I go through, I have a grid in this article that I've done on Tarpley.net.
[02:44:26.239 --> 02:44:34.065]  You go through the grid and you can see that all of these countries, Algeria has got 40,000 Chinese workers building things, right?
[02:44:34.306 --> 02:44:35.967]  What do the Anglo-Americans offer?
[02:44:35.987 --> 02:44:43.713]  The Anglo-Americans come in there and they say, free market, free trade, deregulate, privatize, bust your unions, break up the state sector.
[02:44:44.233 --> 02:44:47.594]  IMF shock therapy, and of course that means you're going to be destroyed.
[02:44:47.834 --> 02:44:54.936]  And the West also then says, we're also going to meddle in your internal affairs under the... So the bankers are declaring war basically on everyone.
[02:44:54.956 --> 02:44:57.537]  We're going to put your article up on screen from tarapii.net.
[02:44:57.937 --> 02:45:02.179]  We're also going to post it, we forgot to do that at infowars.com right now.
[02:45:02.239 --> 02:45:03.039]  Marley's doing that.
[02:45:03.579 --> 02:45:05.960]  But I mean, so this is a desperation move, is it not?
[02:45:07.014 --> 02:45:15.620]  Yes, it's essentially a simultaneous assault on the nation-state all across the world, and the leading edge is Wikileaks.
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:22.565]  Wikileaks last week published new documents proving that the president of Indonesia is corrupt.
[02:45:23.085 --> 02:45:32.652]  And you can see they're going through the entire CIA hit list is reflected in the choice of documents that come out with Wikileaks.
[02:45:32.672 --> 02:45:38.535]  So Wikileaks, I think, is clearly exposed as a CIA limited hangout self-exposure operation.
[02:45:38.856 --> 02:45:42.818]  But the targets of this are the governments that they want to overthrow.
[02:45:43.239 --> 02:45:46.060]  So it has parallels to the revolutions of 1848.
[02:45:46.381 --> 02:45:49.683]  You can see that in some other stuff that I've written.
[02:45:50.103 --> 02:46:11.260]  But the idea is to have a wave of destabilizations that leaves either the nations themselves shattered and divided and balkanized and carved, or maybe in some place like Egypt, which is harder to split up, a government that is so weak and so passive and pathetic that it can easily be be ordered around.
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.343]  Okay, Webster, what's the name of the headline of the article that you want us to put on screen?
[02:46:15.956 --> 02:46:20.039]  Well, I would... The most recent one I did was Obama's Bay of Pigs.
[02:46:20.219 --> 02:46:21.219]  Yeah, that's the one we've got.
[02:46:21.459 --> 02:46:22.200]  Where is this grid?
[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:23.320]  Because I'm going to put it on screen.
[02:46:23.341 --> 02:46:25.422]  The grid is the previous one.
[02:46:25.442 --> 02:46:33.527]  It's the one about... It's essentially behind the orgy of destabilizations.
[02:46:34.287 --> 02:46:36.448]  You've got... I think that's the beginning of the title.
[02:46:36.488 --> 02:46:41.852]  Behind the orgy of destabilizations is an attempt... So where do the globalists go next after this?
[02:46:43.563 --> 02:46:46.627]  Well, today it's Yemen.
[02:46:46.667 --> 02:46:51.432]  Bahrain is targeted because the Bahrain royal family told the U.S.
[02:46:51.752 --> 02:46:55.817]  you're not allowed to use the base of the Fifth Fleet to attack Iran.
[02:46:56.617 --> 02:46:58.119]  Algeria is a target.
[02:46:58.219 --> 02:47:01.302]  Algeria is the other country in North Africa that has a lot of oil.
[02:47:02.601 --> 02:47:05.885]  And that's the place where they've tried to play the China card, right?
[02:47:05.925 --> 02:47:11.611]  Butteflika has turned to the Chinese for infrastructure and development, and they're building everything.
[02:47:11.631 --> 02:47:18.237]  They're building highways and all sorts of infrastructure that the West, of course, refuses to provide.
[02:47:18.838 --> 02:47:20.780]  And then Indonesia, you can look towards them.
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:25.425]  I expect there's a good possibility of a shooting war with Pakistan.
[02:47:26.125 --> 02:47:40.362]  If the United States becomes bogged down now in Libya, especially if the ground invasion of Libya occurs, which I think is an imminent possibility, I don't see Qaddafi's forces being destroyed by this bombing attack.
[02:47:41.022 --> 02:47:41.822]  Maybe when the U.S.
[02:47:41.842 --> 02:47:47.064]  gets bogged down in Libya, the people in Pakistan will say, now it's time for us to invite the U.S.
[02:47:47.104 --> 02:47:54.586]  to leave, which means to cut that supply line that goes from Karachi to the Khyber Pass, the main supply line.
[02:47:54.866 --> 02:47:58.307]  The other thing to stress is the weakness of the imperialists.
[02:47:59.988 --> 02:48:04.010]  In 1991, when Bush the Elder attacked Iraq, he had 1,500 combat aircraft.
[02:48:04.030 --> 02:48:04.010]  1,500.
[02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:07.372]  In 1999, when Clinton, Gore, and Blair struck at Serbia, they had 150 sorties the first day.
[02:48:07.392 --> 02:48:08.152]  This time around, 15.
[02:48:08.192 --> 02:48:09.013]  15 French aircraft.
[02:48:09.033 --> 02:48:12.634]  Now, there were then the 125 cruise missiles, but in terms of manned aircraft,
[02:48:23.501 --> 02:48:25.723]  The imperialists are going down, down, down.
[02:48:26.224 --> 02:48:30.970]  And I think Qaddafi has some surprises up his sleeve in a military sense.
[02:48:31.350 --> 02:48:33.693]  Why don't we say we don't want to find out what those are?
[02:48:34.013 --> 02:48:35.475]  Let's call a halt to this thing.
[02:48:36.116 --> 02:48:39.500]  It's time for a democratic primary challenge to Obama.
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:41.383]  I don't know what anybody's waiting for.
[02:48:41.843 --> 02:48:43.184]  Well, let me stop you there.
[02:48:43.324 --> 02:48:48.588]  Let me stop you there, Tarbley, because while we've got you in limited time, I want to look at what you just raised.
[02:48:48.948 --> 02:48:54.032]  We've got incredible hype right now that Qaddafi is going to launch terror attacks in Europe and the U.S.
[02:48:54.412 --> 02:48:56.334]  That will be then used as the excuse to
[02:48:56.914 --> 02:49:04.722]  Push the full ground invasion and as a domestic police state clampdown to legitimize the TSA, the spy grid.
[02:49:05.423 --> 02:49:13.532]  I think that fits into their overall strategy or strategies, their deceptive strategy to stage a terror attack.
[02:49:13.552 --> 02:49:14.453]  I think that's a real danger.
[02:49:15.154 --> 02:49:19.255]  Well, they were harping on this repeatedly with Saddam Hussein, right?
[02:49:19.355 --> 02:49:26.117]  In 1991, for the first Gulf War, and then in 2003, they were harping and hyping on this, and it never happened.
[02:49:26.157 --> 02:49:27.338]  So I don't see that at all.
[02:49:27.378 --> 02:49:29.998]  I think Qaddafi is too smart for that kind of stuff.
[02:49:30.018 --> 02:49:31.259]  No, they may stage it!
[02:49:31.699 --> 02:49:32.519]  Ah, they may stage it.
[02:49:32.559 --> 02:49:35.220]  But I'm trying to say, this won't be coming from Qaddafi.
[02:49:36.943 --> 02:49:40.266]  Now going back to ground invasion, you think that's in the offing?
[02:49:40.306 --> 02:49:43.349]  They've got the invasion ships off the shore, the troop ships.
[02:49:43.389 --> 02:49:45.491]  Give us your breakdown of why you think that could be imminent.
[02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:50.052]  Well, you're dealing with the French-British imperialists.
[02:49:50.092 --> 02:49:52.014]  Now, this is the Suez Coalition of 1956.
[02:49:52.274 --> 02:49:54.756]  This has special characteristics.
[02:49:55.296 --> 02:49:58.699]  On the British side, these guys are the Colonel Blimps, right?
[02:49:58.719 --> 02:50:03.723]  They're the British generals who, you know, their latest exploits have been in Northern Ireland.
[02:50:03.743 --> 02:50:07.767]  They're essentially coming from a tradition of military losers.
[02:50:08.227 --> 02:50:13.952]  And on the French side, it's another tradition of military losers, going back to Vichy and Marshal Pétain.
[02:50:14.492 --> 02:50:20.877]  So, this is not a pretty thing, but they are now claiming that the British and the French are going to take it over.
[02:50:21.678 --> 02:50:24.841]  The military forces of the French and the British are obsolete.
[02:50:25.301 --> 02:50:29.264]  The British are flying still these tornado jet aircraft.
[02:50:29.284 --> 02:50:35.790]  The tornadoes, Saddam Hussein shot down seven tornadoes 20 years ago in the first Gulf War.
[02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:38.592]  Yeah, in the first two days, so they withdrew them from the field of battle.
[02:50:38.912 --> 02:50:40.792]  These are not reliable planes, they're old.
[02:50:41.152 --> 02:50:49.654]  Now there is this Eurofighter Typhoon, that's ultra-modern, but there the problem is that it's never been used in combat, so nobody knows what the bugs might be.
[02:50:49.754 --> 02:50:51.814]  The truth is they haven't been running around like the U.S.
[02:50:51.854 --> 02:50:57.915]  engaged in constant wars, so they're not good at it, like the United States is, drenched in blood.
[02:50:58.295 --> 02:50:59.976]  Stay there Webster, let's continue.
[02:50:59.996 --> 02:51:01.256]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:01.296 --> 02:51:06.637]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:51:06.877 --> 02:51:08.477]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:51:08.677 --> 02:51:08.857]  I'm good.
[02:51:30.925 --> 02:51:37.287]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:51:37.607 --> 02:51:40.448]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:51:40.788 --> 02:51:43.929]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:43.949 --> 02:51:44.129]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:44.149 --> 02:51:47.090]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:49.351]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:51:59.634 --> 02:52:01.955]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:02.035 --> 02:52:04.216]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:04.336 --> 02:52:07.117]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:07.438 --> 02:52:12.300]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:12.660 --> 02:52:16.842]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:17.162 --> 02:52:19.505]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:19.625 --> 02:52:22.049]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:24.952]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:25.313 --> 02:52:32.923]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:33.246 --> 02:52:38.531]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:38.631 --> 02:52:40.913]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:40.953 --> 02:52:44.917]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:45.177 --> 02:52:46.098]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:46.258 --> 02:52:47.559]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:47.599 --> 02:52:48.600]  Invisible Empire.

[02:52:58.593 --> 02:53:07.936]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[02:53:08.117 --> 02:53:09.077]  My name is Crystal.
[02:53:09.437 --> 02:53:12.038]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[02:53:12.378 --> 02:53:15.999]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:20.321]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[02:53:20.481 --> 02:53:21.302]  What did Crystal do?
[02:53:21.322 --> 02:53:24.946]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[02:53:25.267 --> 02:53:31.574]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[02:53:31.674 --> 02:53:35.238]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[02:54:00.716 --> 02:54:05.860]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:08.802]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:10.717 --> 02:54:13.779]  We've spent an inordinate amount of time on the North African situation.
[02:54:13.799 --> 02:54:19.982]  This sets an incredible precedent where the UN calls the shots as the puppet of the globalists.
[02:54:20.602 --> 02:54:22.223]  Now there's protests in other countries.
[02:54:22.283 --> 02:54:23.164]  Will they invade them?
[02:54:23.664 --> 02:54:26.285]  That clearly is their fake moral high ground.
[02:54:26.626 --> 02:54:29.767]  Webster, I don't want to hear how you want to have this end.
[02:54:30.228 --> 02:54:34.230]  Sure, with a Democrat coming out as truly anti-war and a challenger to Obama.
[02:54:35.111 --> 02:54:36.453]  The empire is going bankrupt.
[02:54:36.473 --> 02:54:37.695]  We can't have four wars.
[02:54:38.056 --> 02:54:39.158]  List those four wars.
[02:54:39.618 --> 02:54:41.662]  But instead, how do you see this ending?
[02:54:41.682 --> 02:54:42.643]  Where do you see this going?
[02:54:43.527 --> 02:54:46.330]  Well, the wars, of course, are the Iraq War, which continues.
[02:54:46.470 --> 02:54:46.930]  The U.S.
[02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:53.416]  is incapable of imposing the puppet Alawi that they want, and the pro-Iranian Maliki remains in power.
[02:54:53.436 --> 02:54:58.040]  That's a very serious index to the weakness of the U.S., which you could see all last year.
[02:54:58.521 --> 02:55:04.426]  Second one, of course, is Afghanistan, where Karzai said last week, NATO must get out of my country.
[02:55:04.546 --> 02:55:05.167]  Get out!
[02:55:05.567 --> 02:55:06.949]  And then, of course, they walked it back.
[02:55:07.009 --> 02:55:08.250]  And now we have these atrocities.
[02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:10.451]  The photos that you're referring to.
[02:55:10.891 --> 02:55:36.162]  Pakistan has been a war of the United States against Pakistan since the West Point speech by Obama in December of 2009, where it's clear the goal is to export the Afghan civil war into Pakistan, break it up along those lines, Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Pashtunistan, four to five ways, split it up so it can't be an energy corridor between Iran and China.
[02:55:36.242 --> 02:55:37.023]  And now we have
[02:55:37.723 --> 02:55:53.214]  Libya, and I think the guaranteed result, unless somebody does something unexpected, let's put it that way, is a further decline in world civilization, because Libya is the most developed country in Africa.
[02:55:53.334 --> 02:55:58.978]  Libya has a higher position on the United Nations Human Development Index
[02:55:59.498 --> 02:56:02.439]  Then Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, or Venezuela.
[02:56:02.739 --> 02:56:11.321]  Qaddafi has done a better job than anybody in the Middle East when it comes to spreading the oil wealth around to the people.
[02:56:11.541 --> 02:56:16.362]  They've got fewer people in jail than the Czech Republic, and of course far fewer than the U.S.
[02:56:16.382 --> 02:56:17.863]  per population.
[02:56:17.883 --> 02:56:20.543]  So this is now in the process of being destroyed.
[02:56:20.563 --> 02:56:27.465]  The imperialist plan is to have the country permanently split and to have maybe two or three different
[02:56:28.045 --> 02:56:30.007]  And Mussolini went in there too!
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:43.720]  Pardon me?
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:45.341]  Didn't Mussolini go into Libya too?
[02:56:45.401 --> 02:56:46.061]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:56:46.101 --> 02:56:51.284]  These were generals working for Mussolini and they of course committed tremendous atrocities.
[02:56:51.804 --> 02:56:58.387]  So it's essentially the decline of civilization itself unless somebody does something unexpected.
[02:56:58.548 --> 02:56:59.408]  It's the bankers!
[02:56:59.888 --> 02:57:11.840]  For those that don't know what a hostile takeover and a breakup is, they come into real companies or countries that have wealth and they just break it all up and sell it for pennies on the dollar, basically give it to themselves.
[02:57:12.121 --> 02:57:14.043]  They're doing this to the whole world right now.
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:18.721]  Yes, and of course, there are other possibilities.
[02:57:18.741 --> 02:57:29.806]  You look at Egypt now, I think encouraging news this morning is that the Egyptian protesters have finally figured something out, that Ban Ki-moon and Moussa are imperialists, and this is not good.
[02:57:31.186 --> 02:57:34.628]  Are there nationalist colonels in the Egyptian army?
[02:57:34.688 --> 02:57:37.149]  Are there people in the Egyptian army who are disgusted
[02:57:37.649 --> 02:57:44.491]  By the behavior of Field Marshal Tantawi and this clique of generals who forced Mubarak out of the country.
[02:57:45.131 --> 02:57:51.593]  If there are some colonels in the tradition of Nasser from the 1950s, that would be something good.
[02:57:52.953 --> 02:57:55.914]  If you have similar forces maybe in Algeria,
[02:57:57.535 --> 02:57:58.895]  Those are also possibilities.
[02:57:59.496 --> 02:58:04.878]  I think the other thing is we've got to realize that the entire operation violates the UN Charter.
[02:58:05.198 --> 02:58:13.142]  The UN Charter says that Chapter 7 military measures can only be used to restore international peace and security.
[02:58:13.463 --> 02:58:16.724]  Never for interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states.
[02:58:17.024 --> 02:58:21.106]  In this case, this is pure interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
[02:58:21.166 --> 02:58:22.867]  It is illegal under the Charter.
[02:58:23.268 --> 02:58:25.809]  And this points to why the United Nations
[02:58:26.369 --> 02:58:27.591]  It's totally unworkable.
[02:58:27.611 --> 02:58:32.055]  Because you have this gaggle of five... Webster, Webster, we're out of time.
[02:58:32.075 --> 02:58:33.637]  We'll talk to you again soon this week.
[02:58:34.058 --> 02:58:37.181]  InfoWars.com, Tarpley.net, GCNlive.com.
[02:58:37.361 --> 02:58:38.943]  We'll cover all the radiation tomorrow.
[02:58:42.326 --> 02:58:44.188]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:47.973]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.893 --> 02:58:51.034]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:58:51.074 --> 02:58:57.738]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:58:57.979 --> 02:59:00.280]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:05.744]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:05.924 --> 02:59:08.706]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:08.966 --> 02:59:11.087]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:11.287 --> 02:59:13.429]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
