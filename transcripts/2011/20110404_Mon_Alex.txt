[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.801]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.381]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:12.942]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.122]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:23.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:24.404]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:26.024]  It is April 4th, 2011 on this Monday edition.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:46.347]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and of course the man behind the hit TV show Conspiracy Theory on TruTV kicked off his latest publicity tour promoting an amazing new book that we by the way are now shipping out.
[00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:48.328]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:51.550]  Available at Infowars.com.
[00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.151]  He's going to be joining us from New York today.
[00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:55.892]  He was on Good Morning America
[00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:05.459]  and said that he would like to be Ron Paul's running mate, that he would run with Ron Paul in the 2012 election.
[00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:19.941]  I talked to him a little bit privately about this months ago before he went down to Mexico, but I didn't know if he was serious or not, and we'll find out today if he really is when former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joins us here on the live broadcast.
[00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:21.362]  In the meantime,
[00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:28.947]  Obviously there is an insane amount of important news to cover.
[00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:38.354]  Chief among it, the open calls to restrict the First Amendment by US Senator Lindsey Graham and others after the
[00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:44.346]  Florida pastor torched the Quran after putting it on trial.
[00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:47.767]  Now he says he's going to put Muhammad on trial.
[00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:54.329]  And there have been at least 24 deaths in Afghanistan due to rioting that's going on.
[00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.550]  And the system is pushing to restrict the First Amendment openly.
[00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.451]  I was listening to local talk radio last night.
[00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:17.206]  Even called into the Kenny Romer Show because about 20% or so, I listened for an hour, roughly 20% of the callers he was taking call after call were for restricting the First Amendment or were saying that we don't have a right to burn a Koran, a Bible, the American flag, you name it.
[00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:26.813]  Now, whereas all of that is obviously disrespectful and distasteful and dangerous, it's still the First Amendment, and that's what it's all about, to live in a free society.
[00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.754]  So I'm going to be breaking this down.
[00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:40.140]  But also, the way the media, the left and controlled right, both the controlled left and right, are more and more pushing kind of the European model of, well, you can have free speech as long as it doesn't incite somebody.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.223]  But if you say something that could upset somebody, we're going to go ahead and fine you or clap you in irons.
[00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:50.727]  We've seen similar things out of Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are.
[00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:57.833]  So I want to look at these attempts to mainline the idea of restricting free speech.
[00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:02.656]  And the controlled right wing loves to say, well, if it hurts our war effort, ban it.
[00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:04.898]  Well, in America, we're the individual sovereigns.
[00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:07.500]  We have our First Amendment dealing with
[00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.614]  Congress shall make no law restricting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:17.316]  In fact, guys, will you grab me a pocket Constitution?
[00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:25.722]  I'm going to go over some of the Bill of Rights today when we come back from break or freedom of the press or the people's right to peaceably assemble for a petition.
[00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:27.122]  I don't think so.
[00:03:43.311 --> 00:04:01.298]  Other bizarre news, Gulf Spill Company hands out safety bonuses to the people that ran the rig that obviously dumped hundreds and hundreds of millions of gallons of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico that then went into the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:04.680]  And of course, the Caribbean Sea.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.483]  Also, gold rises near $1,435 as dollar retreats.
[00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:10.983]  Oil climbs.
[00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:14.125]  We're going to get into Yemen, our gallant little ally.
[00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:17.727]  Machine gunning, large crowds of demonstrators.
[00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:19.228]  And I actually heard Fox News on XM.
[00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.950]  I think?
[00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.815]  Libyan strongman and dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, there in North Africa.
[00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:40.676]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:45.500]  Obama announces his re-election bid as the Wall Street money pours in.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:55.169]  We're also going to get into France invading the Ivory Coast and backing the rebels that reportedly have killed a thousand men, women, and children.
[00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.311]  They're the good guys, so that's okay.
[00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.992]  Just like dropping DU on Libya is good.
[00:05:00.294 --> 00:05:01.475]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:08.401]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:10.964]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:16.348]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:19.391]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:21.453]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:27.938]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:31.320]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.104]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:38.745]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:40.046]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:42.568]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.728 --> 00:05:46.933]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:51.559]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.142]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:05:54.142 --> 00:05:58.027]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:58.027 --> 00:05:59.028]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.211]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:10.614]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:10.614 --> 00:06:17.997]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:22.879]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:24.960]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.101]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:46.452]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:06:46.452 --> 00:06:53.881]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:54.342]  Thank you.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:16.135]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:19.819]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:33.591]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:40.858]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:51.903]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:55.825]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.825 --> 00:08:01.367]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:06.950]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.998 --> 00:08:27.239]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:30.482]  It is Monday, the fourth day of April, 2011.
[00:08:30.482 --> 00:08:41.591]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura has kicked off the promotion tour for his new bombshell book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read.
[00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:46.695]  He'll be joining us today from New York in the second hour.
[00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:48.917]  We certainly look forward to that.
[00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:50.738]  He went on Good Morning America today.
[00:08:51.793 --> 00:09:01.520]  And told them that he would certainly consider running on the ticket with Ron Paul for president in the 2012 election that's going to be kicking off very soon.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:19.254]  In fact, Obama has already kicked it off with a video announcement on his private Barack Obama website that he will be seeking re-election, obviously, and is starting a campaign fundraising tour as the globalist and George Soros types prepare to fill his coffers.
[00:09:19.654 --> 00:09:30.679]  His initial campaign goal is to raise $1 billion so he can continue to be the puppet in chief, but Governor Jesse Ventura scheduled to be joining us today.
[00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:33.921]  Obviously, I'm going to get into the Koran burning situation.
[00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:35.021]  I think?
[00:09:56.154 --> 00:09:56.795]  I think so.
[00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:17.611]  They are being used against Muammar Gaddafi in North Africa.
[00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:32.163]  Also, the French are increasing their invasion force of the Ivory Coast, backing the admitted rebels who reportedly have killed at least a thousand innocent men, women, and children, machine-gunning them and hacking them up with machetes just over the weekend.
[00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:37.587]  And the headlines are, the French are landing to stop the slaughter by backing the rebels that are doing it.
[00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:42.286]  So you gotta love that has nothing to do with humanitarian operations.
[00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:46.028]  Remember the 800,000 conservatively killed in 1994.
[00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:49.030]  First we heard that the UN stood down in Rwanda.
[00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.592]  Then we learned they rounded up the minority group whose land they wanted.
[00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:58.009]  The Tootsies and allow the other group to come in.
[00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:00.711]  In fact, I had the printout on that in my stack yesterday.
[00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:03.572]  Will you guys re-pull my fact sheet on Rwanda?
[00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:05.954]  So when I get into that, I've got the facts in front of me.
[00:11:05.954 --> 00:11:07.635]  I want to make sure of that historically.
[00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:09.756]  Thank you so much.
[00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:20.282]  Obviously, we're going to be getting in to an amazing video clip from former high-level CIA analyst, Michael
[00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:37.593]  Shoyer, who was on CNN and basically went further than I've ever seen him in telling the truth about how this is all a staged event in Libya and basically backing Al Qaeda and that CNN was just carrying the water for those individuals.
[00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:49.375]  That story by the American Dream and the accompanying video is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com under the headline, Former CIA Officer Blows the Lid Off Libya Fraud Live on CNN.
[00:11:51.618 --> 00:12:04.110]  But before I go any further, I want to pull out my trusty Citizen Rulebook, and I want to go to the Bill of Rights.
[00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:15.522]  And when you read the Bill of Rights on page 49 in this version of the Citizen Rulebook that I have here in my hand, it begins with the preamble.
[00:12:16.977 --> 00:12:38.185]  The Conventions of the number of the states having at the time of their adopting the Constitution express a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers the further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added restrictive on government and as extending to the ground of public confidence in the government will best ensure the
[00:12:39.085 --> 00:12:41.966]  Beneficent ends of its institution.
[00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:48.789]  Article 1, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:59.253]  That means government has no jurisdiction over religious activities, cannot tax it, cannot regulate it, cannot abridge it, cannot control it.
[00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:03.455]  Now you know about 501c3 in the last 60 years, roughly, since the late 1940s.
[00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:15.818]  And you know that they trick churches into signing on as charities and waiving their rights by tricking them into a government-created charitable trust.
[00:13:15.818 --> 00:13:28.348]  And then they tell the churches, you can't talk about politics, you can't speak out for drug legalization or drug criminalization or abortion, or you can't speak out against political candidates.
[00:13:28.348 --> 00:13:33.052]  Totally kept enslaved, monitored vassals
[00:13:34.418 --> 00:13:38.241]  Uh, of the federal government.
[00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:39.462]  Completely illegal.
[00:13:39.462 --> 00:13:44.645]  I mean, you just read the Bill of Rights, and the federal government is waging war on every one of them systematically.
[00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:50.910]  But going back to the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting and establishing religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.653]  That means you can have any religion you want, as long as you don't break criminal laws.
[00:13:55.593 --> 00:14:06.383]  Or abridging, let me continue with the First Amendment, freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[00:14:06.383 --> 00:14:10.708]  But you try to protest, even with a permit in D.C., you get arrested half the time.
[00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:12.129]  Without one, you're going to jail.
[00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:14.952]  One man, 20 people, 1,000, they come after you.
[00:14:15.862 --> 00:14:24.885]  There's open calls by Republicans and Democrats and the White House regulations are Cass Sunstein to decide what you can say and can't say.
[00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:27.426]  You can't deny man-made global warming.
[00:14:27.426 --> 00:14:29.067]  They want you arrested.
[00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:31.228]  We've got Senator Jay Rockefeller, Senator
[00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:40.597]  Lindsey Graham, we've got Senator Lieberman, all constantly like barking dogs that won't shut up.
[00:14:40.597 --> 00:14:48.325]  Every time there's some type of crisis, they seize on it and say it's the First Amendment, it's the Internet, it's freedom of speech.
[00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:53.690]  Now if you look at what Europe does, and obviously I'm about to get into the Koran burning situation.
[00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.654]  Europe first came out and said, after World War II, okay,
[00:14:58.905 --> 00:15:04.511]  Germany and other countries now enshrined under EU law over 25 member nations.
[00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:06.993]  First you can't be a white supremacist.
[00:15:06.993 --> 00:15:09.215]  Then you can't criticize immigrants.
[00:15:09.215 --> 00:15:12.358]  Then you can't criticize the EU.
[00:15:12.358 --> 00:15:21.828]  You can't say mean things about a politician because even if they're true that's not a defense because it might incite someone to do something violent.
[00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:32.387]  So if I read the London Telegraph or the London Observer or Bloomberg, who are again reporting on the $376 billion, it's now up from $360 plus billion, dollars that
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:57.434]  Wachovia and Wells Fargo and Wachovia the subgroup of Wells Fargo pled guilty but was not criminally charged and paid a hundred and something million dollar fine a tiny tiny fraction of the three hundred and seventy six billion dollars that they laundered including paying for the aircraft, leasing them, running them, the entire operation.
[00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:59.956]  They make hundreds of billions and they pay a hundred million dollar fine.
[00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:02.683]  It was 100 million and change.
[00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:04.304]  It was 101 million.
[00:16:04.304 --> 00:16:08.466]  I read that article here on air, the latest from the London Guardian, when a caller called in and pointed it out.
[00:16:08.466 --> 00:16:11.668]  Because this was back in the news last year, but now it's back in the news.
[00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:26.256]  If I come out and say that Wachovia was caught dealing drugs, and somebody who's angry, who's say daughter died of a cocaine overdose, and they helped launder the money consciously,
[00:16:27.443 --> 00:16:31.585]  And then that mother goes and gets angry at them and does something.
[00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:32.905]  That's her issue.
[00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:36.126]  And that's their issue for invoking her passion.
[00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:46.230]  I shouldn't be censured with a D-Notice like they have in England, where the government can just quietly block media from reporting whatever they want, because I reported something that made people angry.
[00:16:48.089 --> 00:16:54.430]  I mean, it's like Nixon when they discovered he'd been lying and breaking into things and blackmailing people.
[00:16:54.430 --> 00:17:01.832]  Would Woodward and Bernstein get in trouble for exposing something that caused massive protest, some of them that turned violent?
[00:17:01.832 --> 00:17:02.452]  No!
[00:17:02.452 --> 00:17:12.115]  It's Richard Nixon that got caught engaging in the crimes that, quite frankly, are tame compared to modern times, that elicited that.
[00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.735]  Not the people reporting on it.
[00:17:16.226 --> 00:17:20.190]  Number one, the federal government can make no laws dealing with religion.
[00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.033]  Or they can't tax it, they can't regulate it, they can't tell you what you can and can't do.
[00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.334]  Period.
[00:17:25.334 --> 00:17:29.298]  That's why the Hopi Indians, federal courts have found, are allowed to take peyote.
[00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.440]  Because for thousands of years, that's been part of their religion.
[00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.033]  It's very expansive, because it is the First Amendment.
[00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:41.437]  That is the press, the right to protest, the right to petition, and the right of religion.
[00:17:41.437 --> 00:17:41.898]  Period.
[00:17:41.898 --> 00:17:44.160]  They have no jurisdiction.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:55.729]  These are laws, the big mega-laws, the big King Daddy laws, with statutory penalties against any Fed, or any state agent for that matter, that tries to violate them.
[00:17:58.109 --> 00:18:06.751]  More and more, we see pushes from the controlled left and controlled right of how great it would be to restrict free speech.
[00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:16.892]  The left says that if it hurts equality, or that if it causes division, or makes people upset, or makes people sad, that you don't have a right.
[00:18:16.892 --> 00:18:24.054]  Of course, really, if something isn't true, libel, slander, defamation, then it's a civil matter and you can be brought to justice.
[00:18:24.054 --> 00:18:25.434]  There is that check and balance there.
[00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:29.418]  In the old days, we said something that wasn't true.
[00:18:29.418 --> 00:18:36.065]  Dueling was legal with swords and firearms and somebody knock on your door and say, come outside.
[00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:38.887]  Get your second to make sure the rules are followed.
[00:18:38.887 --> 00:18:46.795]  The local referee and I'm going to meet you on the field or you apologize and admit you're a dirty lying, stinking coward.
[00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:49.658]  But again, I digress with history here.
[00:18:52.847 --> 00:19:06.832]  The media is promoting this pastor who's done this, and I don't agree with what he's done, but I agree with his right to do it, as a pretext to then begin to set the precedence and open the debate to restrict free speech here in America.
[00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:21.117]  And if they can say that he can't burn a Koran, next it will be, like it is in Canada, that people are barred from traveling to Canada or they're arrested if they criticize Muslims, Jews, Christians, but it's selectively enforced mainly only
[00:19:22.938 --> 00:19:26.480]  If you criticize Muslims or Jewish groups, Christianity, it's always great.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:40.468]  If the Canadian Arts Department wants to fund feces on Mary, on an image of Mary, or here in the U.S., the feds want to finance the crucifix in urine, it's great, it's wonderful, it's taken care of.
[00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:46.431]  Because again, Christianity's what's under attack by the globalists because it's the dominant system here.
[00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:49.233]  Islam's under attack at the Middle East because it's the dominant system there.
[00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:55.015]  I'm going to break all this down when we come back and play the shocking clip of Lindsey Graham saying, let's get that First Amendment.
[00:19:55.015 --> 00:19:56.136]  Let's shut it down.
[00:19:56.136 --> 00:20:00.978]  He wants to right now.
[00:20:00.978 --> 00:20:05.981]  Freedom, the blistering anti-globalist anthem from the rock band Ravelin.
[00:20:08.158 --> 00:20:14.322]  Just one of eleven great songs from their album Under the Sun.

[00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:31.037]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.037 --> 00:21:35.600]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:41.404]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:45.046]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:47.768]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.768 --> 00:21:52.831]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:04.878]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:05.458]  The U.S.
[00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:12.720]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.441]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:22:15.441 --> 00:22:18.783]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:22:18.783 --> 00:22:25.425]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:22:25.425 --> 00:22:28.066]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:22:28.066 --> 00:22:28.526]  Treasuries.
[00:22:28.926 --> 00:22:32.449]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:22:32.449 --> 00:22:38.394]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[00:22:38.394 --> 00:22:46.862]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.

[00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:37.896]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:38.697]  This capitalism?
[00:23:38.697 --> 00:23:44.961]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:44.961 --> 00:23:45.822]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:45.822 --> 00:23:49.084]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:49.084 --> 00:23:49.904]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:49.904 --> 00:23:51.285]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:51.285 --> 00:23:51.605]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:51.886]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:05.015]  Ooh, Lordy, my trouble's so hard.
[00:24:05.015 --> 00:24:09.338]  Ooh, Lordy, my trouble's so hard.
[00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:13.761]  Don't nobody know my trouble with God.
[00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:17.464]  Don't nobody know my trouble with God.
[00:24:19.412 --> 00:24:21.534]  So, First Amendment.
[00:24:21.534 --> 00:24:35.284]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievance.
[00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:47.153]  Listening to CNN, Fox, on XM at home and in the car, listening to local talk radio on 590 AM, listening to other national radio in the last few days since the Quran burning kicked off
[00:24:48.214 --> 00:25:01.198]  The video they shot weeks ago and just released Friday, and the subsequent riots in Afghanistan and protests in other parts of the world, and the 24 deaths that have been confirmed in Afghanistan.
[00:25:01.198 --> 00:25:06.039]  Listening to these talk show hosts, a lot of them come out and say, should we restrict speech?
[00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:07.360]  Should we go ahead and arrest this guy?
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:17.565]  And about 20% of the callers on the shows I've heard, and some of the hosts, are openly saying, yeah, they think so, because it hurts the war effort, and General Petraeus said so.
[00:25:17.565 --> 00:25:20.847]  Well, how about General Petraeus stick to being a military commander?
[00:25:20.847 --> 00:25:28.531]  How about he stays out of our political activities here in the U.S., and our First Amendment that he's sworn to protect and defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic?
[00:25:28.531 --> 00:25:31.893]  I guess that makes himself a domestic enemy.
[00:25:31.893 --> 00:25:34.054]  Because when you're an enemy of the First Amendment, you're an enemy of it all.
[00:25:34.813 --> 00:25:36.674]  Okay, we run this country.
[00:25:36.674 --> 00:25:38.114]  We elect the representatives.
[00:25:38.114 --> 00:25:40.135]  We decide what our political views are.
[00:25:40.135 --> 00:25:44.976]  If we don't like a war, and it hurts the war effort, then we shouldn't be having that war.
[00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:46.697]  It's part of a public discourse.
[00:25:46.697 --> 00:25:50.778]  If people want to burn Korans, that's their right to do it.
[00:25:50.778 --> 00:25:53.139]  I think it's stupid, but you know what?
[00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:55.260]  It's speech that's unpopular.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.681]  It's speech that is evocative, that's protected.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.021]  Not just saying, oh, it's a pretty day.
[00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:05.803]  It's a pretty spring day with blue sky and birds tweeting.
[00:26:05.803 --> 00:26:08.724]  Well, nobody cares about that speech.
[00:26:08.724 --> 00:26:11.065]  Nobody gets upset about that.
[00:26:11.065 --> 00:26:13.006]  Or, man, that was a good hamburger.
[00:26:13.006 --> 00:26:14.827]  Nobody cares about that speech.
[00:26:14.827 --> 00:26:17.588]  Or, oh, I sure enjoyed working out at the gym today.
[00:26:17.588 --> 00:26:18.648]  I had a good workout.
[00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:22.210]  Nobody cares about, oh, hey, did you see the NCAA scores?
[00:26:23.021 --> 00:26:25.944]  No, it's there to protect your speech.
[00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:28.948]  And if Christians want to say Muslims are bad, that's their right.
[00:26:28.948 --> 00:26:34.134]  And if Muslims want to say Christians are bad, or Jews are bad, or Jews want to say Muslims are bad, that's their right.
[00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:42.484]  Or if atheists want to say Christians and Muslims are idiots, or if cartoonists want to draw cartoons making fun of the Prophet Muhammad, that's their right.
[00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:46.275]  That's their right to do that.
[00:26:46.275 --> 00:26:48.157]  That's why America's free.
[00:26:48.157 --> 00:26:50.240]  Now we're becoming less and less free.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:58.110]  But it's so naked and out in the open to have Lindsey Graham and a bunch of others saying they want to move with legislation.
[00:26:59.363 --> 00:27:06.927]  To restrict the First Amendment in America on anything that could, quote, hurt a war effort or upset somebody.
[00:27:06.927 --> 00:27:08.968]  Anything that could be provocative.
[00:27:08.968 --> 00:27:18.413]  Why aren't we talking about the people that have killed 24 policemen, reportedly, in Afghanistan?
[00:27:18.413 --> 00:27:20.774]  Have killed NATO troops.
[00:27:20.774 --> 00:27:23.576]  They've beheaded multiple UN workers.
[00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:29.332]  They go out and kill people that had nothing to do with this Koran burning.
[00:27:29.332 --> 00:27:31.693]  They are the ones with the problems.
[00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:34.035]  They are, now listen, they're suppressed in Afghanistan.
[00:27:34.035 --> 00:27:35.676]  They don't have any real liberties.
[00:27:35.676 --> 00:27:45.462]  But governments in the Middle East and Central Asia will allow people to blow up and vent their anger towards Western governments, even though many of those governments are puppets that allow that venting.
[00:27:45.462 --> 00:27:47.724]  Because it's politically popular.
[00:27:47.724 --> 00:27:50.686]  Because under Sharia law, it's a big no-no to burn a Koran.
[00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.672]  Well, we're not under Sharia law.
[00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.614]  We're not under Vatican law.
[00:27:55.614 --> 00:27:56.515]  We're not under that.
[00:27:56.515 --> 00:28:00.220]  Sure, 500 years ago, if you burned a Bible, the Vatican would burn you at the stake.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.461]  We're not under that.
[00:28:01.461 --> 00:28:04.524]  We're under the First Amendment.
[00:28:04.524 --> 00:28:08.088]  George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and that's whose side I'm on.
[00:28:09.033 --> 00:28:14.637]  I believe my ideas are historical, are accurate, are cutting edge, are direct.
[00:28:14.637 --> 00:28:18.699]  And I know my ideas in a level playing field are going to win.
[00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:28.686]  So you can say your idiotic things as long as you don't try to come to my house to take me to jail because you want my property or you want my land or you want my children or you want to
[00:28:29.366 --> 00:28:32.367]  Stomp on my free speech, you can have your free speech.
[00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:41.870]  But the minute you touch me, the minute you lay your hands on me, the First Amendment, the Declaration of Independence says I can unleash absolute firepower on you.
[00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.171]  Do you understand that?
[00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:50.373]  Now let's go, we're going to go to break and come back with a Lindsey Graham clip, but in the long segment coming up.
[00:28:50.373 --> 00:28:51.654]  But this is incredible.
[00:28:53.636 --> 00:28:56.117]  And they really are pushing this.
[00:28:56.117 --> 00:28:59.278]  Here's Curt Nemo's excellent article at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:59.278 --> 00:29:09.001]  Lindsey Graham advocates killing First Amendment in response to idiotic and pointless burning of the Koran by Florida pastor and the deadly riots that fall in Afghanistan.
[00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:12.382]  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has proposed limiting the First Amendment.
[00:29:13.683 --> 00:29:18.626]  He told CBS's Bob Schaefer Sunday, I wish we could find a way to hold people accountable.
[00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:20.948]  Free speech is a great idea, but we're in a war.
[00:29:20.948 --> 00:29:27.472]  Oh, it's a great idea, but he went on to say that he is preparing to try to get legislation passed to do this.
[00:29:27.472 --> 00:29:32.595]  And he also promoted FDR's Executive Order 8985 that established the Office of Censorship.
[00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:35.736]  So they're promoting that.
[00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:42.880]  The order gave a legion of bureaucrats absolute discretion over the existence of the First Amendment and free speech of all Americans.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.043]  And you couldn't criticize war profiteering or planes that fell out of the sky because they were shoddily made.
[00:29:48.043 --> 00:29:50.765]  You had to love the corruption.
[00:29:50.765 --> 00:29:52.166]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.166 --> 00:29:54.687]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.687 --> 00:29:57.369]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:04.847]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.847 --> 00:30:05.748]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.748 --> 00:30:09.190]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.050]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.933]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:15.673]  It's true.
[00:30:15.673 --> 00:30:20.556]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:21.376]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:24.958]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:28.660]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.660]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.421]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.421 --> 00:30:36.103]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.103 --> 00:30:36.883]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.883 --> 00:30:41.045]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.045 --> 00:30:46.087]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.087 --> 00:30:50.268]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:03.876]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[00:32:00.213 --> 00:32:03.777]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.777 --> 00:32:04.918]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:04.918 --> 00:32:09.482]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.482 --> 00:32:15.427]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:15.427 --> 00:32:17.589]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:17.589 --> 00:32:20.252]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:20.592 --> 00:32:27.097]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.

[00:32:29.298 --> 00:32:34.642]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:34.642 --> 00:32:39.926]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.

[00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:54.795]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:32:54.795 --> 00:32:55.595]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:18.704]  We're about 30 minutes away from former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joining us.
[00:33:18.704 --> 00:33:22.206]  The ABC News headline is, Vice President Ventura?
[00:33:22.206 --> 00:33:24.087]  Will he run with Ron Paul?
[00:33:24.087 --> 00:33:29.331]  We'll ask him about that when he joins us from New York, coming up when we start the next hour.
[00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:48.682]  Okay, going back to this whole First Amendment issue, listening to Talk Radio host, listening and watching Fox and CNN, they are openly saying, well, Lindsey Graham does have a point, and General Petraeus, we might have to restrict free speech if it hurts the war effort.
[00:33:48.682 --> 00:33:53.925]  Now remember, over 70% of Americans in every major poll want us out of Afghanistan.
[00:33:53.925 --> 00:33:55.847]  Nine plus years, coming up on 10 years.
[00:33:57.571 --> 00:34:02.192]  With no publicly stated reason to be there, it's always changing.
[00:34:02.192 --> 00:34:10.995]  They say security, but it's really about 500 billion in opium, trillions in oil pipeline control, destabilizing Pakistan.
[00:34:10.995 --> 00:34:21.758]  And then we've got Fox News with Geraldo last year with the Marine Corps Colonel saying, yeah, we help grow the opium for the locals, because if we don't, Al-Qaeda will make the money.
[00:34:21.758 --> 00:34:26.559]  I mean, they're publicly producing this stuff in front of everybody.
[00:34:27.276 --> 00:34:42.548]  Now, that said, if they're able to set the precedent to say that if it hurts a war effort and the government and the military decides if it does, then we're living in an official dictatorship of a bunch of autocratic control freaks.
[00:34:43.775 --> 00:34:57.978]  And they are quoting times in World War II where there were censors, dealing with military news, what ships were being launched, what time they were leaving, which is unconstitutional in and of itself right there.
[00:34:57.978 --> 00:35:11.342]  But now they're expanding that to say that if a misguided preacher burns something, well then, we've got to go ahead and go after them.
[00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.282]  And if they can do that,
[00:35:13.271 --> 00:35:21.421]  Well, then any political group out there can go out and protest, or throw some all-off cocktails, and then the government's going to come in and say, we've got to restrict that.
[00:35:21.421 --> 00:35:22.843]  And that's what the EU does.
[00:35:22.843 --> 00:35:24.124]  That's what Canada does.
[00:35:24.124 --> 00:35:26.788]  The government decides if something's provocative.
[00:35:26.788 --> 00:35:29.351]  They decide if something could incite someone.
[00:35:31.306 --> 00:35:43.971]  And Europe has moved to censure newspapers that have had cartoons in the last few years of Mohammed with his turban as a bomb or things like that.
[00:35:43.971 --> 00:35:56.876]  And whereas I'm not trying to stir up religious groups, I'm not trying to create division and infighting, and the globalists are actually hyping this up to create balkanization and division and clash of civilizations so they can stir the Muslims up to
[00:35:57.976 --> 00:35:58.436]  I think so.
[00:36:15.384 --> 00:36:17.566]  I'm going to get to this Afghanistan thing.
[00:36:17.566 --> 00:36:22.468]  General Petraeus today condemned the actions of this Florida preacher who burned the Koran.
[00:36:22.468 --> 00:36:24.610]  You heard what Senator Reid said.
[00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.312]  Is there anything that actually can be done along this line?
[00:36:29.758 --> 00:36:33.522]  You know, I wish we could find some way to hold people accountable.
[00:36:33.522 --> 00:36:36.645]  Free speech is a great idea, but we're in a war.
[00:36:36.645 --> 00:36:40.548]  During World War II, you had limits on what you could say if it would inspire the enemy.
[00:36:40.548 --> 00:36:45.173]  So, burning a Koran is a terrible thing, but it doesn't justify killing someone.
[00:36:45.173 --> 00:36:48.576]  Burning a Bible would be a terrible thing, but it wouldn't justify a murder.
[00:36:48.576 --> 00:36:49.637]  But having said that,
[00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:55.781]  Anytime we can push back here in America against actions like this that put our troops at risk, we ought to do it.
[00:36:55.781 --> 00:37:04.266]  So I look forward to working with Senator DeCarrie and Reid and others to condemn this, condemn violence all over the world based on the name of religion.
[00:37:04.266 --> 00:37:11.391]  But General Petraeus understands better than anybody else in America what happens when something like this is done in our country.
[00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:16.434]  And he was right to condemn it, and I think Congress would be right to reinforce what General Petraeus said.
[00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:25.523]  Uh, we saw the report from Liz Palmer, uh, on perm oil all across... And it goes on from there, uh, with more of similar statements.
[00:37:25.523 --> 00:37:28.443]  So, he says the First Amendment's a great idea.
[00:37:28.443 --> 00:37:30.704]  Well, no, it's a great law.
[00:37:30.704 --> 00:37:31.624]  It's the law.
[00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:33.464]  It's what America's founded on.
[00:37:33.464 --> 00:37:39.866]  It's the First Amendment for a reason, Lindsey, who supports carbon taxes, uh, and the rest of it, a sickening little globalist.
[00:37:40.686 --> 00:37:51.048]  He also brings up World War II and censors, and then went on to bring up executive orders to restrict it, and there's other discussions about trying to introduce laws.
[00:37:51.048 --> 00:37:57.710]  He says they should push back the out-of-control government, the out-of-control Pentagon.
[00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:05.812]  What happened six months ago when polls came out showing over 70% of the American people in Gallup did not want us to be in Afghanistan anymore?
[00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:08.756]  And what did the Secretary of Defense Gates say?
[00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:10.796]  He said, I don't care what you think.
[00:38:10.796 --> 00:38:12.917]  I don't care what the American people want.
[00:38:12.917 --> 00:38:14.958]  I thought we run the government.
[00:38:14.958 --> 00:38:16.719]  It wasn't a declared war.
[00:38:16.719 --> 00:38:18.599]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:20.380]  We're there almost 10 years later.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.041]  It's a joke.
[00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:25.662]  And they lie to us as a matter of course.
[00:38:25.662 --> 00:38:30.944]  Turns out they admit special forces from the US and Britain were in the east of
[00:38:32.093 --> 00:38:38.979]  The North African country of Libya, before all this started, that it is Al-Qaeda is the core of the group, being funded and armed by the West.
[00:38:38.979 --> 00:38:44.604]  They've taken over the oil port, set up their own bank, their own oil company.
[00:38:44.604 --> 00:38:50.589]  And they're going to spread this contagion all over Africa as a pretext for the West to invade.
[00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:59.117]  Then France and other EU countries, they're on the west coast of Africa and the Ivory Coast with all the oil and gold and diamonds that are there.
[00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:29.133]  claim that uh... the incumbent lost the election when that's disputed then they finance the rebel leader who reportedly has people with machetes and guns hacking and killing people just a thousand this weekend men women and children and then you read the headlines more french troops landing an airport taking over getting behind the rebels to stop the massacres and then buried footnotes it's the rebels engage in the massacres this is the new globalist model they finance rebels
[00:39:30.031 --> 00:39:40.318]  To start a war with a country the globalists want to invade, no-fly zones, bombing, invasions.
[00:39:40.318 --> 00:39:46.282]  But then meanwhile, in Yemen, the death toll rises as U.S.
[00:39:46.282 --> 00:39:50.325]  said to press the leader to go.
[00:39:52.026 --> 00:39:52.766]  And it goes on.
[00:39:52.766 --> 00:39:54.267]  I was listening to Fox News this morning.
[00:39:54.267 --> 00:39:59.670]  They admitted that the government that's Western-backed is machine-gunning crowds en masse.
[00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:04.012]  The death toll is unknown.
[00:40:04.012 --> 00:40:09.475]  And I'm listening to Fox, and they've got a reporter from there saying, well, the government here is fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:13.377]  That's, that's, you know, if they don't do this to these protesters with live ammunition,
[00:40:14.807 --> 00:40:16.928]  That's what they call shooting people and killing them.
[00:40:16.928 --> 00:40:24.312]  If they don't stop using live ammunition, if they do stop, then Al-Qaeda may take over in the power vacuum here.
[00:40:24.312 --> 00:40:27.073]  And so you've got to understand they need to do this.
[00:40:27.073 --> 00:40:36.998]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda is in Libya running these operations, Western-backed, with that long history of using Al-Qaeda to hit the Russians, hit the Serbs, hit others.
[00:40:36.998 --> 00:40:43.342]  They're now calling them Mujahideen again and telling us that we're doing it because Qaddafi
[00:40:44.522 --> 00:40:47.102]  Fought back against the rebels.
[00:40:47.102 --> 00:40:49.823]  So a very dangerous global system.
[00:40:49.823 --> 00:41:05.006]  And I even have a clip off Fox News I meant to play yesterday where the host admitted on that show that this is part of forming global government and setting the precedent for UN-NATO back groups to invade whoever they want, whenever they want.
[00:41:05.006 --> 00:41:13.207]  So should a foreign government invade the United States under UN orders at Kent State whenever the military National Guard shot some people?
[00:41:15.754 --> 00:41:18.016]  Should we invade Yemen?
[00:41:18.016 --> 00:41:21.898]  Should the globalists use our power and our military we've paid for to do that?
[00:41:21.898 --> 00:41:27.922]  I mean, what happens when the Pakistanis on a routine basis shoot crowds of protesters?
[00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:34.747]  Do you hear talk of invading Pakistan?
[00:41:34.747 --> 00:41:41.532]  Why aren't they calling the people chopping the heads off UN forces, shooting NATO forces in Afghanistan?
[00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.133]  Why aren't they calling them freedom fighters?
[00:41:44.321 --> 00:41:47.503]  I don't think they're freedom fighters when they're killing and chopping people's heads off.
[00:41:47.503 --> 00:42:04.252]  But if a group rebels and tries to overthrow an unpopular government, and it's admitted Karzai stole the election, and it is a dictatorship in Afghanistan, then if you're going to invade Libya over this, which they're now admitting, well we're going to have a ground force, but it's going to be to back up the rebels for humanitarian support.
[00:42:04.252 --> 00:42:08.595]  And the bombs dropping, that's not a war either.
[00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:12.157]  Just like Limbaugh last week, he said, well, look at this Rolling Stone article.
[00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:17.456]  We've got the troops accidentally killing innocent people.
[00:42:17.456 --> 00:42:19.979]  No, they knew they were killing people that weren't armed.
[00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:23.763]  And he says, well, that's because our government's inept, our military's inept then.
[00:42:23.763 --> 00:42:27.247]  Because used to, we killed people on purpose, civilians.
[00:42:27.247 --> 00:42:28.809]  No, we didn't do that until World War II.
[00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:46.762]  Okay, and if Limbaugh wants to go along with that line that attacking civilians is good, well then, if he believes 9-11 wasn't an inside job, if he believes 9-11 was an outside job, then he has to say that Al-Qaeda legitimately attacked civilian targets on 9-11.
[00:42:46.762 --> 00:42:49.023]  I don't agree with that.
[00:42:49.023 --> 00:42:53.427]  But see, they expect us to not have common sense and logic.
[00:42:53.427 --> 00:43:00.272]  I mean, we have a public mind, at least a portion of the population, that's very duplicitous.
[00:43:01.991 --> 00:43:06.039]  That's extremely duplicitous in their worldview.
[00:43:06.039 --> 00:43:13.693]  Common sense, more and more, has been extricated completely out of the window.
[00:43:15.307 --> 00:43:19.069]  I have another video clip we're going to play here in just a moment.
[00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:24.353]  And again, if you want to watch this video, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:24.353 --> 00:43:31.077]  Former CIA officer blows lid off Libya fraud live on CNN.
[00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:35.940]  And of course, he's former top analyst Michael Shoyer.
[00:43:37.842 --> 00:43:49.367]  And this article from the American Dream reports every once in a while establishment control the media cracks for a moment in an effort to achieve higher ratings mainstream news programs will invite guests on that promise to be interesting.
[00:43:49.367 --> 00:43:53.389]  Now it starts slow in this six minute clip, but it gets hardcore.
[00:43:53.909 --> 00:44:07.806]  At the end when he basically just says this is nothing but a propaganda channel and he begins to admit that basically this is Al Qaeda being backed in North Africa by the West and he agrees with Ron Paul's analysis of the situation.
[00:44:07.806 --> 00:44:10.809]  He was the CIA's top Bin Laden expert.
[00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:11.430]  Here's that clip.
[00:44:13.919 --> 00:44:14.999]  Former CIA officer.
[00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:18.001]  Now help for Libyan rebels from the CIA.
[00:44:18.001 --> 00:44:20.382]  President Obama reportedly signing off on this.
[00:44:20.382 --> 00:44:26.244]  Sources say CIA operatives are on the ground in Libya and in contact with the opposition.
[00:44:26.244 --> 00:44:32.767]  And joining us to talk more about the CIA's possible role in Libya, from Washington, former CIA counterterrorism analyst Michael Scheuer.
[00:44:32.767 --> 00:44:34.348]  Michael, thanks for being with us this morning.
[00:44:34.348 --> 00:44:34.988]  You're welcome.
[00:44:34.988 --> 00:44:41.411]  So there are reports out again that the CIA is on the ground in Libya, contacting and vetting the rebels.
[00:44:41.411 --> 00:44:42.331]  Is this safe space for them?
[00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:43.212]  They were there from the start!
[00:44:44.446 --> 00:44:47.888]  I don't think there's any other possible reason for it.
[00:44:47.888 --> 00:45:04.177]  And the President clearly has sent the agency in to find out who he is supporting and to see what kind of material, human material, we would have to work with if we decided to, if the President decided to arm and train these people over the longer term.
[00:45:04.177 --> 00:45:05.658]  Yeah, and you're concerned about this prospect.
[00:45:05.658 --> 00:45:08.480]  You think it could become another Taliban situation for the U.S.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.761]  What, in your mind, is the worst case scenario here?
[00:45:11.462 --> 00:45:25.972]  Well, Libya has been very strong in sending young men, or having its young men, go overseas to fight in Islamic insurgencies in the Balkans, in Chechnya, Afghanistan, especially Iraq, when the height of the fighting was there.
[00:45:25.972 --> 00:45:28.093]  Those that don't get killed, of course, go home.
[00:45:28.093 --> 00:45:38.040]  And I think the core of the resistance, whatever little military ability they have, is probably made up by people elsewhere we would call Mujahideen.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.643]  And so it's a dicey proposition to be getting involved with this.
[00:45:42.643 --> 00:45:48.767]  I'm not sure that the opposition, if it takes power, is going to be much better than was Qaddafi.
[00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:57.413]  But that's why you need to have the CIA, I presume, in there vetting, as we said, who are these people, who are the elements that are funding them or supporting them.
[00:45:57.873 --> 00:46:02.617]  Who are the politically the most palatable or the least palatable among them?
[00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:05.659]  The White House saying that no decision has been made.
[00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:08.761]  I have a question for you as a CIA veteran, I guess.
[00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:13.565]  I mean, the fact that we even know about this, is that unusual?
[00:46:13.565 --> 00:46:18.329]  I mean, should we just assume that the CIA in this sort of a situation would of course be in there on the ground?
[00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:22.864]  Well, you have to assume that the president wants the best information that he can get.
[00:46:22.864 --> 00:46:26.967]  And if he wants to have that information, he has to have somebody on the ground.
[00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:31.709]  And so, yes, I think you assume wherever there's trouble, you'll find the agency.
[00:46:31.709 --> 00:46:33.691]  The other point I would make here is that
[00:46:34.671 --> 00:46:42.263]  Vetting the people who are in the opposition, of course, you're only able to do that to the extent that they're willing to talk to you.
[00:46:42.263 --> 00:46:49.194]  I think the agency will find a lot of people who are pro-democracy and westernized happy to talk to them.
[00:46:50.235 --> 00:46:56.859]  The more Islamic-oriented people aren't going to talk to them because that would bring into question our air support for them.
[00:46:56.859 --> 00:47:05.725]  So this is a mission that's a very difficult one and the chances of success are really probably not better than 50-50.
[00:47:05.725 --> 00:47:12.810]  What's the alternative if we don't arm the rebels and they're clearly outmanned and outgunned by Qaddafi's forces?
[00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.711]  What's the better solution here?
[00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:18.495]  The better solution was, as Mr. Paul said, never go at all.
[00:47:18.495 --> 00:47:20.077]  This was none of our business.
[00:47:20.077 --> 00:47:23.019]  But I think what we're seeing is the string is playing out.
[00:47:23.019 --> 00:47:25.140]  We threatened Qaddafi and that didn't work.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.682]  There's an arms embargo and an economic embargo.
[00:47:27.682 --> 00:47:28.883]  That didn't work.
[00:47:28.883 --> 00:47:30.985]  There was a UN resolution and that didn't work.
[00:47:31.605 --> 00:47:36.649]  Ariel bombing has continued and has impact, but it hasn't defeated him.
[00:47:36.649 --> 00:47:42.853]  Now we're at the stage where we're going to try to apparently try to train and arm the resistance.
[00:47:42.853 --> 00:47:44.194]  That takes a long time.
[00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:47.716]  I don't know if we have that time against Qaddafi.
[00:47:47.716 --> 00:47:54.461]  What we're seeing is the president putting himself into a corner where his only option is ground troops.
[00:47:55.236 --> 00:47:59.057]  But that's something that no one says that they want to do.
[00:47:59.057 --> 00:47:59.957]  They're already there!
[00:47:59.957 --> 00:48:01.557]  I mean, they simply don't want to do that.
[00:48:01.557 --> 00:48:10.819]  Well, the choice may come down to admitting that it was a mistake in being defeated, in the sense that Gaddafi survives, or putting ground troops in.
[00:48:10.819 --> 00:48:12.279]  Nations are a lot like people.
[00:48:12.279 --> 00:48:15.700]  They don't like admitting to mistakes.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:20.681]  And maybe they don't want to put them in, but when it comes down to looking defeat in the face, I wonder.
[00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:33.704]  You know, you led CCA's unit that tracked Osama bin Laden 1996 to 1999, and you believe that much like that situation, America's involvement in Libya could prove to be a recruiting tool for extremists.
[00:48:33.704 --> 00:48:34.324]  Why?
[00:48:34.324 --> 00:48:36.165]  Oh, it's absolutely a recruiting tool.
[00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:40.346]  It's the American-led West attacking a Muslim country that has oil.
[00:48:40.346 --> 00:48:44.907]  I mean, be very careful to say it's not the American-led West, that NATO has now fully taken over the operations.
[00:48:44.907 --> 00:48:50.708]  Well, that may fool... Of course, our firepower was used in the beginning, but that this is a coalition that includes Arab states.
[00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.189]  That may fool some Americans.
[00:48:53.189 --> 00:48:57.570]  It's not going to fool the people who sympathize with Bin Laden and other Islamists.
[00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.111]  This is really a U.S.-led operation.
[00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:02.291]  And you talk about the Arab states that are involved.
[00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.672]  The Arab states are tyrannies that are hated by their own people.
[00:49:05.672 --> 00:49:13.954]  This is a piece of theater set up by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain and the bipartisan group that loves to intervene abroad.
[00:49:13.954 --> 00:49:20.036]  In the Muslim world, this is Americans killing Muslims again, and it looks like it's for oil.
[00:49:20.256 --> 00:49:24.459]  I just want to ask, are you trying to have it both ways and saying that, okay, these are tyrannies that hate their own people?
[00:49:24.459 --> 00:49:29.983]  Well, that's why we're helping, because in Libya, it was the people that wanted Qaddafi out, that they were tired of it.
[00:49:29.983 --> 00:49:37.548]  So, weren't we then supporting Islamic democracy, I guess you could say, in these countries where they're tired of totalitarian rule?
[00:49:37.548 --> 00:49:43.812]  If we were supporting Islamic democracy, that would be one thing, but if you listen to Mrs. Clinton, and especially the rather crazed Ms.
[00:49:43.812 --> 00:49:49.336]  Rice at the UN, this is all about democracy in a world where democracy is not going to take hold.
[00:49:49.744 --> 00:49:54.785]  I think it's very clear, Michael Schoyer, that you are no fan of this policy and this administration.
[00:49:54.785 --> 00:50:01.007]  I think calling Ambassador Rice crazed is certainly a significant charge.
[00:50:01.007 --> 00:50:01.907]  Well, I don't know.
[00:50:01.907 --> 00:50:02.868]  I've just listened to her.
[00:50:02.868 --> 00:50:04.228]  You know, that's only my impression.
[00:50:04.228 --> 00:50:06.509]  And I have to say, this is not a Democratic problem.
[00:50:06.509 --> 00:50:08.589]  This is a Republican problem, too.
[00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:11.570]  Both parties love to intervene in other people's business.
[00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.311]  Where there are no U.S.
[00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:19.137]  interests at stake and where we spend enormous amounts of money at a time when we're nearly bankrupt.
[00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:22.500]  That doesn't seem to me to be a wise practice of American statesmanship.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.122]  And that's a whole other story.
[00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:32.409]  To call the United States bankrupt, the United States is running humongous deficits, yes, but the economy and this mission in Libya are two separate issues.
[00:50:32.449 --> 00:50:33.651]  They're not separate issues, ma'am.
[00:50:33.651 --> 00:50:35.493]  You're just carrying the water for Mr. Obama.
[00:50:35.493 --> 00:50:39.439]  I'm certainly not carrying anyone's water, and I will assure you of that.
[00:50:39.439 --> 00:50:41.522]  Michael Scheuer, thank you so much for your time.
[00:50:41.522 --> 00:50:43.364]  We've had a very long, exhaustive interview.
[00:50:43.364 --> 00:50:45.527]  You had plenty of time to give your point of view on that.
[00:50:45.527 --> 00:50:46.609]  We're going to be right back.
[00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:47.450]  It's 38 minutes past 8.
[00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.811]  Thanks, Michael.
[00:50:48.991 --> 00:50:52.793]  There you go, I mean those two women just going off talking points.
[00:50:52.793 --> 00:50:58.435]  There he is laying out the facts to these teleprompter reading creatures.
[00:50:58.435 --> 00:51:00.476]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.476 --> 00:51:02.277]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.277 --> 00:51:10.881]  The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation.
[00:51:11.141 --> 00:51:11.481]  We're good.
[00:51:34.392 --> 00:51:34.892]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.543 --> 00:52:05.224]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:58.243 --> 00:53:01.466]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:07.072]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.072 --> 00:53:12.098]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.098 --> 00:53:17.123]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.643 --> 00:53:22.867]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:29.992]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.992 --> 00:53:31.112]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.112 --> 00:53:37.477]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.797 --> 00:53:40.978]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.978 --> 00:53:43.198]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:43.198 --> 00:53:44.138]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:44.339]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.339 --> 00:53:47.779]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.779 --> 00:53:49.540]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:10.014 --> 00:54:11.075]  We are back live.
[00:54:11.075 --> 00:54:16.518]  Governor Jesse Ventura will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:16.518 --> 00:54:23.822]  You just heard Michael Schoyer, former top CIA analyst on the Middle East, saying we are a bankrupt country.
[00:54:23.822 --> 00:54:25.703]  See, the globalists are offshore banks.
[00:54:25.703 --> 00:54:29.466]  They use America as their credit card to finance their operations.
[00:54:30.888 --> 00:54:34.811]  And even if you're for a corrupt empire, we don't get any of the spoils of this.
[00:54:34.811 --> 00:54:41.396]  We fit the bill, we become hated, then the system uses outside enemies as a pretext to take our liberties.
[00:54:41.396 --> 00:54:42.718]  And he talks about the U.S.
[00:54:42.718 --> 00:54:53.006]  being really technically bankrupt, that's what most analysts concur on, through the fraud of the derivatives, and they just start laughing at him, like it's funny.
[00:54:53.006 --> 00:54:58.870]  This is the same news channel that tells us the economy rebounded a year and a half, almost two years ago, in June of 2009.
[00:55:01.388 --> 00:55:12.157]  Speaking of attacks on free speech in the court system, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to be tried by military commission after years of being held and admittedly torture, Holder set to make announcement today.
[00:55:12.157 --> 00:55:14.339]  Well, if he's a terrorist, put him up before a trial.
[00:55:14.339 --> 00:55:16.020]  Let's see the evidence.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.424]  And under announcements by Bush and the Military Commissions Act, they can do this to citizens.
[00:55:20.424 --> 00:55:21.805]  And Obama's continued all that.
[00:55:23.114 --> 00:55:31.232]  They're not just attacking the First Amendment or the Second, they're attacking the Ninth, the Tenth, the Seventh, the Fourth, the Fifth, due process, everything is under attack.
[00:55:33.066 --> 00:55:38.449]  Coming up later, gold rises to close to an all-time high, $1,435.
[00:55:38.449 --> 00:55:39.690]  Silver exploding.
[00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.832]  Japan nuke plant operated to dump radioactive water into the ocean.
[00:55:42.832 --> 00:55:44.433]  Japan nuclear crisis.
[00:55:44.433 --> 00:55:47.655]  Workers using newspapers and sawdust to block pipes.
[00:55:47.655 --> 00:55:52.739]  The Germans are sending over their giant, the biggest concrete dumper in the world to try to fix it.
[00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:59.884]  Fukushima workers again trying to plug radiation leaks with bits of newspaper, garbage bags, diaper-like material.
[00:55:59.884 --> 00:56:09.592]  Steve Watson reports at PrisonPlanet.com and they're also reporting in California 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine found in the water supply.
[00:56:09.592 --> 00:56:14.375]  The New York Times buried that as a footnote yesterday.
[00:56:14.375 --> 00:56:17.558]  Don't forget with Ventura coming up we are carrying and now shipping out
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.281]  What I think is his most powerful book.
[00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:21.102]  Each one gets better.
[00:56:21.102 --> 00:56:23.643]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[00:56:23.643 --> 00:56:27.546]  We're going to be going over this and a lot more with Jesse Ventura coming up.
[00:56:27.546 --> 00:56:30.028]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:30.028 --> 00:56:40.355]  Also the books, the videos, the potassium iodate, the rad stickers, the strategic relocation book that we're almost sold out of.
[00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:42.776]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:42.776 --> 00:56:45.919]  Also some of our other sponsors that make the broadcast possible.
[00:56:47.165 --> 00:56:52.853]  Diamond Gusset jeans made in America celebrating 25 years.
[00:56:52.853 --> 00:56:58.520]  Rarely does a song like Looking for America that they promoted by Mark Williams explode like it has.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:04.428]  Diamond Gusset released this on the Alex Jones Show first and we want to thank the listeners for making it a hit.
[00:57:05.049 --> 00:57:05.229]  I think?
[00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.930]  You know what?

[00:58:37.704 --> 00:58:38.865]  Governor Jesse Ventura, straight ahead.
[00:58:44.178 --> 00:58:48.164]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:55.980]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:59.523]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.523 --> 00:59:02.125]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:08.009]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.009 --> 00:59:14.234]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.654 --> 00:59:20.637]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.637 --> 00:59:24.818]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.818 --> 00:59:29.100]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:35.062]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.062 --> 00:59:38.604]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.604 --> 00:59:40.585]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.585 --> 00:59:41.025]  It's here.

[01:00:10.076 --> 01:00:11.657]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.657 --> 01:00:13.218]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:17.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.463]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:36.037]  Well, we've got a jam-packed interview, and I'm very honored that Ventura chose our show in the first day of his kickoff and promotion of the new book that I think is his best.
[01:00:36.037 --> 01:00:37.858]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:40.879]  We're going to be going over some of these documents in the next hour.
[01:00:40.879 --> 01:00:46.382]  We're going to learn here today, is the TV show coming back with another hit season on True TV?
[01:00:47.903 --> 01:00:53.209]  Well, ABC News has the headline, Vice President Ventura talking about maybe a run with Ron Paul.
[01:00:53.209 --> 01:00:55.291]  He'll clarify that.
[01:00:55.291 --> 01:01:00.076]  The TSA was in Fox News last week saying they're going to try to overthrow his lawsuit.
[01:01:00.076 --> 01:01:03.379]  But there's dozens and dozens of others that have been filed.
[01:01:03.379 --> 01:01:05.802]  Nine states moving to pass laws.
[01:01:05.802 --> 01:01:06.503]  One's already done it.
[01:01:07.283 --> 01:01:11.106]  Hi Alex, always great to talk to you and I wish you could see my beautiful suntan.
[01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:38.802]  No, I'm doing terrific.
[01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:51.629]  I flew into New York last week and I started kicking off the book tour and I'm really excited about this book and I want everyone to understand that every document in this book is out in the public domain.
[01:01:52.722 --> 01:01:55.945]  You know, there's nothing that we did illegally to gain documents.
[01:01:55.945 --> 01:02:05.972]  And in fact, in the epilogue of the book, readers can go to many of the sources if they are intrigued and they want to learn more and do their own research.
[01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.934]  We give you a complete list of where to go on the Internet.
[01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:12.797]  And Alex, I might add, guess what I have now, believe it or not?
[01:02:12.797 --> 01:02:14.278]  What?
[01:02:14.278 --> 01:02:16.760]  I know this is going to shock you.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.283]  I now have an official Jesse Ventura website.
[01:02:20.283 --> 01:02:20.723]  Awesome!
[01:02:20.723 --> 01:02:21.384]  Tell us about it.
[01:02:23.374 --> 01:02:25.116]  We ain't got time to bleed dot com.
[01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.537]  We ain't got time to bleed dot com.
[01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:47.266]  Well, maybe so.
[01:02:47.266 --> 01:02:48.466]  I haven't seen it myself.
[01:02:48.466 --> 01:02:51.467]  I've been too busy traveling, so that I give credit to my son.
[01:03:09.298 --> 01:03:12.259]  Well, Ty's a great guy and has done a great job on the TV show.
[01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:14.360]  We've gotten to be good friends and talk routinely.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.781]  He's got a lot of irons in the fire.
[01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:18.442]  He's got a new movie he just finished that's going to be coming out soon.
[01:03:18.442 --> 01:03:19.463]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:25.905]  He's working and I like the idea that I don't have to support him too much anymore.
[01:03:25.905 --> 01:03:33.349]  Like all parents do for their children, you know, you gotta carry them a little bit on your back until they get their feet on the ground.
[01:03:33.973 --> 01:03:37.016]  Well, he did a great job on the two seasons of the show, man.
[01:03:37.016 --> 01:03:38.658]  I'm really impressed with his work.
[01:03:38.658 --> 01:03:39.138]  Thank you.
[01:03:39.138 --> 01:03:40.320]  Appreciate it very much.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.421]  But anyway, enough of that.
[01:03:41.421 --> 01:03:43.063]  Let's get down to business here.
[01:03:43.063 --> 01:03:43.523]  Absolutely.
[01:03:43.523 --> 01:03:45.165]  This is always a short segment at the first.
[01:03:45.165 --> 01:03:47.047]  We're coming back in a long segment.
[01:03:47.047 --> 01:03:49.109]  What do you want to get into first?
[01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:55.896]  Because I want to get into the book at the bottom of the hour, so we focus on that in one big chunk, going through some of the 63 documents.
[01:03:58.985 --> 01:04:04.412]  Well, okay, then when we come back, let's get into Vice President Ventura.
[01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:05.493]  This is ABC News.
[01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:08.497]  You can follow Sam, we're about to go to break, but reading part of ABC News.
[01:04:08.497 --> 01:04:14.284]  He's been a Navy SEAL, pro wrestler, author, governor of Minnesota, and even appeared on a soap opera.
[01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:17.608]  So is running for Vice President the next thing on Ventura's to-do list?
[01:04:17.608 --> 01:04:18.349]  And this is the quote.
[01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:25.175]  I will tell you this, if Ron Paul runs as an independent, I will give great consideration to being his running mate.
[01:04:25.175 --> 01:04:42.189]  He told Good Morning America, Ventura dedicated his book, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read, to Representative Ron Paul, calling him the only federally elected official who will stand up for the American people on the congressional floor, but the former governor said he would not join the ticket if Paul runs as a Republican.
[01:04:42.189 --> 01:04:42.450]  Never!
[01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:44.831]  I will not be a Democrat or Republican.
[01:04:44.831 --> 01:04:46.413]  They are the problem, not the solution.
[01:04:46.413 --> 01:04:48.474]  We need to abolish political parties in this country.
[01:04:48.474 --> 01:04:49.695]  Ventura said.
[01:04:49.695 --> 01:04:50.836]  What about Representative Bachman?
[01:04:50.836 --> 01:04:52.717]  Well, we'll tell you what he said about her as well.
[01:04:52.717 --> 01:04:56.740]  We'll get it directly from Jesse Ventura live and uncensored on the other side.
[01:05:00.623 --> 01:05:02.284]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:05:52.696 --> 01:05:53.196]  Thank you!
[01:06:00.213 --> 01:06:04.774]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.774 --> 01:06:05.674]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.674 --> 01:06:09.115]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.115 --> 01:06:09.975]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.975 --> 01:06:14.857]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.857 --> 01:06:15.597]  It's true.
[01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:20.478]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.478 --> 01:06:21.298]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.298 --> 01:06:24.879]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:28.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.060]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.342]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.342 --> 01:06:36.024]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.024 --> 01:06:36.824]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.824 --> 01:06:40.967]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:45.730]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:50.192]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.192 --> 01:06:51.973]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.973 --> 01:06:54.235]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:54.235 --> 01:06:56.576]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:03.960]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.261]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:09.663]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:09.663 --> 01:07:15.605]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:15.605 --> 01:07:17.466]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:17.506 --> 01:07:17.926]  I think?
[01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:40.116]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:07:40.116 --> 01:07:45.478]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.680]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.682]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:51.682 --> 01:07:52.442]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:08:05.407 --> 01:08:10.253]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:11.835]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.835 --> 01:08:13.377]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.377 --> 01:08:17.582]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.582 --> 01:08:21.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:30.984]  Well this happens a lot we tend to crash people's websites even if they're on huge servers, but we're gonna Hopefully do that here today.
[01:08:30.984 --> 01:08:39.790]  We ain't got time to bleed calm is Jesse Ventura's new maiden website full of insight scoop and his views on the world I'm looking at the
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.672]  Home page right now on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:42.672 --> 01:08:47.316]  It's got dossier, appearances, declassified vault, outpost.
[01:08:47.316 --> 01:08:50.398]  He's got letters to the ruling class right up there on the front page.
[01:08:50.398 --> 01:08:57.584]  The new book that just officially came out today is already making its way to the top of Amazon and the top of the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:08:57.584 --> 01:09:01.307]  If you want to support InfoWars.com, we have the book discounted out of the gates.
[01:09:01.307 --> 01:09:03.989]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:03.989 --> 01:09:05.750]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.632]  And I've loved all his books and I've read them all.
[01:09:08.452 --> 01:09:18.539]  Uh, from Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, uh, you know, to his latest book, but I gotta tell you, uh, this book, uh, is his most powerful, and it's a coffee table page turner.
[01:09:18.539 --> 01:09:25.944]  It's something to give somebody, because it's all 63 documents that are public, that are declassified, that are admitted, but a lot of them nobody knows about.
[01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:29.306]  It's got the big ones like Northwoods and Paperclip, but it's got the others.
[01:09:29.306 --> 01:09:37.792]  At the bottom of the hour, we're gonna walk through some of what Jesse thinks are the top 10 or so, uh, in the book, available at InfoWars.com or
[01:09:38.672 --> 01:09:45.157]  The website WeAin'tGotTimeToBleed.com and he's here for just a week doing a limited tour and then he's back to Mexico.
[01:09:45.157 --> 01:09:48.360]  We're going to talk about will he run with Ron Paul for president?
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.403]  What's his view on his suit against the TSA and mounting resistance to it?
[01:09:52.403 --> 01:09:53.603]  We've got a host of things.
[01:09:53.603 --> 01:09:55.245]  His TV show coming back.
[01:09:55.245 --> 01:09:59.088]  I've got the inside scoop here but he'll give it to you live on air for everybody out there.
[01:09:59.088 --> 01:10:03.531]  But before we go there Governor, again just want to welcome you to the airwaves and glad you're back in the U.S.
[01:10:05.322 --> 01:10:13.829]  I think it's only temporarily, but I need to get back to Mexico quick because I'm losing my sun tan.
[01:10:13.829 --> 01:10:19.073]  Now, I want to just run through a grab bag of laundry list of things before we get into the really big issues.
[01:10:19.073 --> 01:10:24.257]  You were telling me during the break you didn't know about Libya for a week, you didn't know about the earthquake for a week.
[01:10:24.257 --> 01:10:30.022]  Tell us what it's like down in Mexico and then your view on Libya, your view on the earthquake and the ongoing radioactive fallout.
[01:10:32.179 --> 01:10:33.099]  I go to Mexico.
[01:10:33.099 --> 01:10:34.460]  I spend four months down there.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.561]  I live an hour from pavement and an hour from electricity.
[01:10:37.561 --> 01:10:39.922]  My house is completely solar.
[01:10:39.922 --> 01:10:41.723]  And I don't watch TV.
[01:10:41.723 --> 01:10:44.244]  And I really, I call it flushing my brain out.
[01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:49.666]  I go down there and I live a life where I only pay attention to what's within eyesight of me.
[01:10:50.306 --> 01:10:58.729]  And it's kind of nice, you know, I'm 59 years old now, and it's kind of nice to do that every year because it kind of reinvigorates you, as you'll see.
[01:10:58.729 --> 01:11:02.550]  I'm reinvigorated right now, and when I permanently do come back to the U.S.
[01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.091]  in May, I'll be ready to roll even more.
[01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:12.814]  But I'm getting old now, so I've got to take those breaks and go out on the ladder occasionally and enjoy the ocean and everything like it down there.
[01:11:12.814 --> 01:11:19.356]  And I really, in fact, I'll tell you this, Alex, my wife and I were considering applying for Mexican citizenship.
[01:11:20.353 --> 01:11:20.713]  Really?
[01:11:20.713 --> 01:11:23.414]  Yeah, no, and that doesn't mean I'm giving up my U.S.
[01:11:23.414 --> 01:11:24.475]  citizenship.
[01:11:24.475 --> 01:11:26.655]  You can have dual citizenship.
[01:11:26.655 --> 01:11:35.899]  But it would make, since I go down there so often, it would make life a lot easier crossing the border both ways if you're a citizen of both countries.
[01:11:35.899 --> 01:11:37.480]  Well, it's obviously a beautiful country.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.400]  I've been all over it.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.621]  But it is, in many cases, a failed state.
[01:11:41.621 --> 01:11:44.882]  I've read the area you're in is a lot safer than other areas.
[01:11:44.882 --> 01:11:48.864]  But are you ever concerned about the country completely collapsing into bedlam?
[01:11:50.543 --> 01:11:52.103]  I don't know if that could happen.
[01:11:52.103 --> 01:11:54.144]  I don't know, but you know, maybe it needs somebody.
[01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:57.985]  If I become a citizen, Alex, that means I can run for office down there, doesn't it?
[01:11:57.985 --> 01:11:58.485]  Ha!
[01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:03.626]  Oh, so you're the governor of the Baja?
[01:12:03.626 --> 01:12:06.227]  Or maybe president of Mexico.
[01:12:06.227 --> 01:12:06.907]  Are you serious?
[01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:08.207]  I think they love you down there.
[01:12:08.207 --> 01:12:11.068]  You know, I say that tongue-in-cheek, you know.
[01:12:11.068 --> 01:12:20.010]  You gotta remember, I'm still just a big old gringo to those people down there, and I'm sure they want to, if they were to elect someone who was probably born and raised there.
[01:12:20.717 --> 01:12:26.944]  Well, expanding on that, you've been outspoken about this, and all the experts that look at it agree.
[01:12:26.944 --> 01:12:41.199]  If they decriminalize drugs, the destabilization of Mexico would end overnight, but they don't want to decriminalize them because it just came out in Bloomberg, $376 billion in drug money laundered by Wachovia and Wells Fargo.
[01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:44.148]  You're kidding!
[01:12:44.148 --> 01:13:09.669]  Well, you know, if you tie it in to what happened in Afghanistan, when we went in, you know, when the Taliban went into Afghanistan, they shot down all the poppy growers and the drug lords over there, and you know, all that money gets channeled right through, laundered right through the international banks, and maybe that played a major role in the, you know, the bank downturn and the bailout that we had to do here in the United States.
[01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:14.235]  Because they weren't getting their illegal drug money and of course now that the U.S.
[01:13:14.235 --> 01:13:24.510]  is back in there and our allies seem to be the drug dealers of Afghanistan, I guess the poppy business is up and running good again and the banks are getting silent again.
[01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:30.593]  And your book does get into some of that as well, the 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:13:30.593 --> 01:13:44.537]  Looking at the Libya situation, it turns out that Al-Qaeda, according to even the Washington Post, is the core of the rebels now being armed by the West, just like they armed them against the Serbs, just like the West armed them against the Russians.
[01:13:44.537 --> 01:13:45.417]  Wait, Alex.
[01:13:45.417 --> 01:13:52.999]  If Al-Qaeda is on the side of the rebels in Libya, why are we fighting them in Afghanistan then?
[01:13:54.443 --> 01:13:55.304]  Absolutely, Governor.
[01:13:55.304 --> 01:14:01.907]  What's your view?
[01:14:01.907 --> 01:14:03.408]  Well, it's like 1984.
[01:14:03.408 --> 01:14:05.609]  One day we're at war with them, the next day we aren't.
[01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:15.015]  But yeah, we're fighting them in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and the rebel leader even admits that he sent al-Qaeda to Iraq to, quote, kill U.S.
[01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:15.955]  soldiers.
[01:14:15.955 --> 01:14:19.497]  That was the headline last week, but now he's our gallant little ally.
[01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:20.858]  What do you think's happening in Libya?
[01:14:20.858 --> 01:14:21.859]  Maybe the trillions in oil?
[01:14:24.147 --> 01:14:25.488]  What's that got to do with Orwell?
[01:14:25.488 --> 01:14:35.595]  You know, if you look at what we enter into, and I made this statement to us, that unfortunately young men and women that join our military today, they're not really defending us.
[01:14:35.595 --> 01:14:40.238]  What they are, they're the strong arm for big multinational corporations.
[01:14:40.238 --> 01:14:42.400]  And it's been going on for years and years.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:50.445]  If you read the memoirs of General Smedley Butler, the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner who died in 1940, he's the best
[01:14:51.806 --> 01:15:04.091]  It was way back in the teens and twenties that the Marine Corps essentially worked for the United Fleet Corporation and when Central and South American companies wouldn't cooperate, they sent in the Marines.
[01:15:04.091 --> 01:15:17.436]  So, you know, and it hurts me and pains me to say that, being a United States veteran, that, you know, it seems that our military doesn't really work for us, they work for whatever the corporations want them to do.
[01:15:18.985 --> 01:15:31.972]  Well, that's four wars now, and on the Ivory Coast, the rebels admittedly have killed a thousand innocent people, so the French have now invaded on the west coast of Africa to back up the rebels overthrowing the government.
[01:15:31.972 --> 01:15:35.854]  This looks like the start of an invasion of the African continent to me.
[01:15:37.323 --> 01:15:40.266]  I know it's gotta be in the hundreds of thousands.
[01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:40.366]  Whoa!
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:25.147]  Well you notice that Obama promised to have the most transparent government ever and now he's had more secret meetings at the White House, classified more stuff than even Bush.
[01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:42.022]  And they're continuing the torture, the secret arrest.
[01:16:42.022 --> 01:16:43.586]  He just reauthorized the Patriot Act!
[01:16:48.394 --> 01:16:59.216]  This thing violates our Constitution in half a dozen places, and yet, why does our country, and where's our Supreme Court here, you know?
[01:16:59.216 --> 01:17:09.598]  Our country was set up before fathers so that a President and a Congress cannot simply pass a law and have it supersede the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:17:09.598 --> 01:17:13.399]  You've got to go through hoops, you've got to change the Constitution,
[01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:14.983]  I don't know.
[01:17:27.452 --> 01:17:28.532]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:17:28.532 --> 01:17:38.616]  In fact, we saw Obama not even consult Congress three weeks ago when they got the United Nations resolution for the bombardment, the so-called no-fly zone.
[01:17:38.616 --> 01:17:39.476]  And we know U.S.
[01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:42.057]  and British Special Forces have been in there the whole time.
[01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:48.639]  Since when does the President not even consult Congress before at least Bush would get some type of authorization of force?
[01:17:49.179 --> 01:17:53.240]  Well, you know, they, they, they, but even that they do after the fact.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.922]  You know, they, they passed that law way back in the 70s, and they're violating the hell out of it.
[01:17:58.922 --> 01:18:05.384]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex, I, when I'm in Mexico, I don't even call us the United States of America anymore.
[01:18:05.384 --> 01:18:07.844]  Do you know what I refer to us as?
[01:18:07.844 --> 01:18:10.085]  The fascist states of America.
[01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.346]  Everybody in this country thinks we're going socialist.
[01:18:12.346 --> 01:18:12.966]  No, we're not.
[01:18:19.232 --> 01:18:21.903]  Organized religion team up to control the government!
[01:18:23.186 --> 01:18:44.150]  Well, you're absolutely on target there, and I've noticed how they're making it all about cutting unions and cutting spending, which is great, but all the economists I've interviewed have pointed out the 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives, if we don't say no to Wall Street's trillions of debt they've created that they've gotten government to sign onto and bail out, then there's no way.
[01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:49.651]  We could cut everything, and it wouldn't even pay for a fraction of the debt that we've been signed onto.
[01:18:52.304 --> 01:19:04.334]  You got all these Republican and these new governors out there that are literally destroying the unions, the public unions and all that stuff, and laying the financial blame on them?
[01:19:04.334 --> 01:19:07.996]  What, because some union asked for a dollar more an hour?
[01:19:07.996 --> 01:19:09.137]  Give me a break!
[01:19:09.137 --> 01:19:19.826]  And yet nobody on Wall Street has gone to prison over this mess, and yet they're gonna now hiss the blame and try to make the public believe it's unions that are at fault.
[01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:25.312]  Exactly, and we've got a leg chopped off, and the media is focusing in on a hangnail.
[01:19:25.312 --> 01:19:26.432]  Exactly.
[01:19:26.432 --> 01:19:27.673]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:19:27.673 --> 01:19:31.314]  They're focusing in on a hangnail, and we've got our leg chopped off.
[01:19:31.314 --> 01:19:33.135]  A good way to say it.
[01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:37.297]  Well, but you're absolutely right, Governor, that this is a bait-and-switch.
[01:19:37.297 --> 01:19:41.658]  I'm not even saying that these unions, some of them aren't, you know, a little bit entitled.
[01:19:41.658 --> 01:19:42.799]  Well, of course.
[01:19:42.799 --> 01:19:46.120]  You've got to understand, unions can get overbearing, too.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.341]  But I'll tell you what, if you want to destroy
[01:19:51.502 --> 01:19:59.086]  And they've done that, and the middle class is falling apart, and now the unions are basically just Democratic Party attack dogs to collect dues for them.
[01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:00.026]  Exactly.
[01:20:00.026 --> 01:20:05.009]  And they're not even honest, because I can give you a complete example on that end.
[01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:15.094]  When I ran for governor of Minnesota, me, Shunk, my lieutenant governor, and I were the only two vested union members in the race, and we didn't get one union endorsement.
[01:20:19.329 --> 01:20:22.893]  The unions were taken over from within a long time ago.
[01:20:22.893 --> 01:20:29.760]  Governor Ventura, let's get into... Not the union itself, just the union leadership.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:40.471]  Because I went to one union meeting with the rank-and-file, and so did I. I was there to endorse me, and yet the leadership threw that out, and the endorsement went to Skip Humphrey.
[01:20:42.859 --> 01:20:52.287]  So they've taken over the full spectrum of the Republicans and Democrats and all these major institutions that were set up to serve the people in our interest.
[01:20:52.287 --> 01:20:54.129]  Now we've got special interest.
[01:20:54.129 --> 01:20:58.253]  Let's talk about your Good Morning America interview where you kicked off your tour this morning.
[01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:00.815]  The headline is Vice President Ventura
[01:21:01.015 --> 01:21:02.456]  Well, wait a minute now.
[01:21:02.456 --> 01:21:03.076]  I never said that.
[01:21:03.076 --> 01:21:04.837]  I never said he'd be president or vice president.
[01:21:04.837 --> 01:21:06.117]  Ron and I may have to flip a coin.
[01:21:26.855 --> 01:21:28.996]  I just said I would run with him.
[01:21:28.996 --> 01:21:31.077]  But no, I'm just having fun with Alex.
[01:21:31.077 --> 01:21:40.721]  In fact, this book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to See, if you look at it, I dedicated the book to Congressman Ron Perl.
[01:21:40.721 --> 01:21:50.704]  And I did that because he was the only Congressman we have that had the courage to go out on the floor of the Congress and support WikiLeaks.
[01:21:55.936 --> 01:22:03.061]  How many people have died from the trumped up intelligence and the lying that got us into the Iraq war?
[01:22:03.061 --> 01:22:05.963]  And then he said something even more profound.
[01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:07.244]  And that was this.
[01:22:07.244 --> 01:22:14.569]  He talked about, in a free country like ours, when the truth equals treason, we're in big trouble.
[01:22:14.569 --> 01:22:16.711]  And that's what in essence they're saying.
[01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:18.452]  If you tell the truth, you're guilty of treason.
[01:22:22.914 --> 01:22:34.604]  No, I just said that if Ron Paul would quit the Republican Party, because I will not run as a Democrat or Republican.
[01:22:34.604 --> 01:22:36.946]  I want nothing to do with these parties.
[01:22:36.946 --> 01:22:39.748]  They are the problem, they are not the solution.
[01:22:39.748 --> 01:22:44.272]  They're the ones that have been in control of this country like Ralph Nader calls himself.
[01:22:55.327 --> 01:22:56.188]  We're good to go.
[01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:09.082]  We're good to go.
[01:23:28.376 --> 01:23:29.016]  I think so.
[01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:54.464]  Governor Jesse Ventura, of course, host of the hit investigative show Conspiracy Theory.
[01:23:54.464 --> 01:24:03.448]  Ron Paul's view, and I've talked about this on-air and off-air privately with him, he's obviously a libertarian, ran as a libertarian in the late 80s, only got a fraction of the vote.
[01:24:03.448 --> 01:24:08.130]  His view is, use the Republican Party apparatus, the fundraising engine,
[01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:16.596]  The fact that they're already in all 50 states, that they have the boots on the ground, that he thinks the best chance to win is through that system.
[01:24:16.596 --> 01:24:18.658]  He certainly doesn't like the two parties.
[01:24:18.658 --> 01:24:21.060]  He decries the two parties.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:24.303]  But Alex, he won't get the Republican nomination.
[01:24:24.303 --> 01:24:26.324]  He has to understand that.
[01:24:26.324 --> 01:24:31.148]  The Republicans are not going to put Ron Powell up as the presidential nominee.
[01:24:32.372 --> 01:24:40.059]  I think you're right at a certain point, because even Ronald Reagan was too conservative in 1980, and it was on record that they ordered him.
[01:24:40.059 --> 01:24:50.809]  They said, we don't care if you've won, we're not going to nominate you, even though you've been winning in these states, unless you put George Herbert Walker Bush, Mr. CIA in there, who really became the shadow president.
[01:24:57.719 --> 01:25:02.924]  I don't believe the Republicans would, no matter how many of these he wins, he's too much of a rogue.
[01:25:02.924 --> 01:25:12.234]  He is not bought and sold by the multinational corporations, plus the biggest thing of all, he calls for an audit of the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:12.234 --> 01:25:19.081]  Do you think the Republican or Democratic parties are going to stand for a candidate that demands
[01:25:21.411 --> 01:25:24.333]  Well, not in the past, but he did get it passed in the House.
[01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:26.794]  They use a procedural to block it in the Senate.
[01:25:26.794 --> 01:25:31.697]  His son, Rand, who we've interviewed many times, has now been traveling to Iowa and places.
[01:25:31.697 --> 01:25:33.798]  Looks like he may be getting ready for a run.
[01:25:33.798 --> 01:25:35.799]  But here's the headline.
[01:25:35.799 --> 01:25:38.581]  Paul Bidd wouldn't get snubbed this time.
[01:25:38.581 --> 01:25:41.363]  That's out of a big syndicated column in papers.
[01:25:41.963 --> 01:25:42.303]  I don't
[01:26:00.771 --> 01:26:05.553]  Well, I agree with you, but the point is, if you're going to impeach Obama, you should have impeached Bush and Cheney.
[01:26:05.553 --> 01:26:08.535]  You know, absolutely, because they're the ones that set the tables around this stuff.
[01:26:08.535 --> 01:26:09.896]  They destroyed the economy.
[01:26:34.256 --> 01:26:36.777]  But you would support impeachment hearings in the House?
[01:26:36.777 --> 01:26:37.838]  Oh, he's really bad, yeah.
[01:27:04.941 --> 01:27:07.964]  You know, you could hurt yourself by doing that.
[01:27:07.964 --> 01:27:11.669]  To me, let's impeach these guys by voting them out of office next election.
[01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:13.191]  Both Democrats and Republicans.
[01:27:13.191 --> 01:27:14.212]  That's the way to impeach them.
[01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:27.799]  Governor, looking now at the TSA situation, I have the report here, ABC News.
[01:27:27.799 --> 01:27:31.762]  Feds want Ventura's suit against TSA thrown out, but they've got a problem.
[01:27:31.762 --> 01:27:38.967]  At least nine states passing laws and preparing to pass laws saying it's illegal, that a peace officer can't stick their hand down your pants.
[01:27:38.967 --> 01:27:42.549]  How can some minimum wage goon do it?
[01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:51.135]  Break down your view on the building resistance to the TSA, and I just want to thank you as well for putting yourself out on the field yet again with this lawsuit.
[01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:51.394]  I think.
[01:27:54.071 --> 01:28:00.354]  Alex, I don't want to sound... Oh, I don't know what to say, but this show only involves me.
[01:28:25.459 --> 01:28:26.160]  I don't know.
[01:28:40.559 --> 01:28:44.844]  I'm not asking for money or any such damages.
[01:28:44.844 --> 01:28:47.968]  All I'm asking them to do is stop.
[01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:21.141]  I have metal in my body, so when I go through the metal detector, I could go through it naked and it's going to go off, which then subjects me to the sexual groping or the x-ray machine.
[01:29:21.141 --> 01:29:23.784]  Well, this summer I'm doing my TV show.
[01:29:23.784 --> 01:29:27.406]  I'm traveling, flying 3-4 times a week.
[01:29:27.406 --> 01:29:30.309]  They cannot tell me that they have definitive proof.
[01:29:37.867 --> 01:29:38.707]  Governor, stay there.
[01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:39.808]  We gotta go to break.
[01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:42.529]  Let's come back and finish up with that with the TSA.
[01:29:42.529 --> 01:29:44.971]  Then get into the book and a lot more.
[01:29:44.971 --> 01:29:46.091]  Infowars.com, folks.
[01:29:46.091 --> 01:29:48.832]  We're interviewing former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:29:48.832 --> 01:29:51.053]  We'll talk about the TV show as well.
[01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:52.434]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.434 --> 01:29:54.975]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.975 --> 01:29:57.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.746 --> 01:30:01.907]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.907 --> 01:30:08.852]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.852 --> 01:30:11.394]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.394 --> 01:30:16.778]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:19.820]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.882]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.122 --> 01:30:28.384]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.384 --> 01:30:31.765]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.765 --> 01:30:37.547]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.547 --> 01:30:39.188]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.188 --> 01:30:40.468]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:43.149]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:44.570]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:45.230]  We're good to go.
[01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:06.293]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.293 --> 01:31:15.156]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.156 --> 01:31:19.797]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:19.797 --> 01:31:30.621]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.241 --> 01:31:40.750]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:46.195]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.195 --> 01:31:53.681]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:53.681 --> 01:31:56.444]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:01.593 --> 01:32:05.594]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.594 --> 01:32:08.835]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.835 --> 01:32:13.636]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:32:13.636 --> 01:32:20.018]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:20.018 --> 01:32:22.259]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.819 --> 01:32:23.119]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.119 --> 01:32:23.640]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.300]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.581]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:27.822]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:48.994]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.994 --> 01:32:58.099]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:11.471]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.164 --> 01:33:21.349]  Well, the book by New York Times bestselling author Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:33:21.349 --> 01:33:26.192]  We're going to segue into the book, which again, I'm not just typing this.
[01:33:26.192 --> 01:33:33.057]  This is the book to give somebody to wake them up because it's 63 documents and it's like eating popcorn.
[01:33:33.057 --> 01:33:37.640]  You want to go to the next one, the next one, the next one, and you just learn more and more.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.581]  And there's the 100% proof.
[01:33:39.581 --> 01:33:41.002]  This is not speculation.
[01:33:41.002 --> 01:33:43.263]  The book is available at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:44.624 --> 01:33:46.585]  Discounted out of the gates or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:46.585 --> 01:33:53.629]  You can also get Mark Dice's new book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare, come true with it.
[01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:56.710]  When you get the two books together, you can get one of my films free.
[01:33:56.710 --> 01:34:00.312]  Whichever film you choose at Infowars.com.
[01:34:00.312 --> 01:34:01.993]  Now getting into the TSA.
[01:34:01.993 --> 01:34:02.913]  Think about it, folks.
[01:34:02.913 --> 01:34:05.755]  Now they're announcing all from Tennessee to New York.
[01:34:06.175 --> 01:34:14.863]  National Guard, TSA, Viper teams, federal marshals, bus stations, highways, train stations, sticking their hands down pants there.
[01:34:14.863 --> 01:34:16.864]  That's all over the news.
[01:34:16.864 --> 01:34:23.830]  9,000 locations, Mall of America, Walmarts, putting in big telescreens, and we've now got footage, we've now shot footage of these going in.
[01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:27.132]  Saying, watch your neighbors, don't trust people.
[01:34:27.132 --> 01:34:28.852]  That's directly out of 1984.
[01:34:28.852 --> 01:34:49.636]  When I watch the mid-80s film written by Stephen King that's so powerful, The Running Man, with Jesse Ventura and Schwarzenegger, when they're creeping around the city, Schwarzenegger is, trying to hide out from Ventura, you see big billboards saying, hey kids, October is bonus recruitment month, report a family member and get a double bonus.
[01:34:49.636 --> 01:34:54.097]  This is directly out of 1984, and now they've set the precedent.
[01:34:54.517 --> 01:34:54.797]  I think?
[01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:15.635]  Can't pull you over and stick their hands down your pants unless it's an emergency.
[01:35:15.635 --> 01:35:33.952]  How does the TSA... So Governor, I want to finish up with your lawsuit, but then I want to ask you, what do you think of the expansion to TSA on the streets, where you pull up to a checkpoint and they want to now drive you under radiation machines, and they admit that they haven't calibrated the machines and it's many times more radiation than they'd first said.
[01:35:33.952 --> 01:35:35.354]  Governor, breaking down your lawsuit.
[01:35:37.236 --> 01:35:49.603]  The other thing that's interesting about my lawsuit, and again it's only for me, you know, and I am stating that it is, I pose no threat and therefore they're violating my Fourth Amendment, but here's what's interesting.
[01:35:49.603 --> 01:36:01.670]  Certain members of our elected people, and I'm not talking the President here because he's got his own plane, but certain members of our elected, they're not, they don't have to submit to this, the Speaker of the House.
[01:36:02.768 --> 01:36:03.088]  Uh, no.
[01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:43.216]  Well, Governor, you're absolutely right, but more than just the fact that Pelosi and Obama, they're now...
[01:36:45.163 --> 01:36:47.105]  Absolutely, Boehner.
[01:36:47.105 --> 01:36:52.830]  And as many as 50 members of the House and Senate are now exempt.
[01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:56.313]  They've been videotaped just being waved around security.
[01:36:56.313 --> 01:36:58.254]  Here's my question.
[01:36:58.254 --> 01:37:06.782]  Is this not bonafide two-tier class system where they are exempt from their own bureaucracy that they're foisting on us, Governor?
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:15.122]  Initially, I was going to sue under the Federal Disabilities Act.
[01:37:15.122 --> 01:37:16.102]  Right?
[01:37:16.102 --> 01:37:19.363]  Because because of the metal in my body, I'm disabled.
[01:37:19.363 --> 01:37:23.004]  And that says they're to accommodate my disability.
[01:37:23.004 --> 01:37:26.325]  Well, what's happening is they're exploiting my disability.
[01:37:26.325 --> 01:37:27.245]  Get this.
[01:37:27.245 --> 01:37:28.706]  Get this.
[01:37:28.706 --> 01:37:34.668]  One week later, my attorney calls me back and says, we can't sue under the American Disabilities Act.
[01:37:34.668 --> 01:37:36.088]  And I said, why not?
[01:37:36.088 --> 01:37:38.469]  He goes, it doesn't apply to the federal government.
[01:37:40.316 --> 01:37:40.897]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:06.988 --> 01:38:08.429]  Well, here's an example of that.
[01:38:08.429 --> 01:38:26.980]  Obama has now handed out thousands of waivers to McDonald's and their hundreds of thousands of employees alone, but to thousands of companies that are campaign donors, they get a waiver and don't have to buy health insurance, but your hamburger place or your restaurant next door, you've got to buy the insurance.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:35.605]  That's a true form of economic discrimination here, where the imperial federal government hands out favors to those that basically bribe them.
[01:38:38.757 --> 01:38:49.227]  And like I said, I would love to get on TV with John Boehner and ask him point-blank, how are you more patriotic than me?
[01:38:49.227 --> 01:38:57.475]  And let me add this, when I won mayor, Alex, and when I won governor, you've had a claim to title honorable.
[01:39:03.342 --> 01:39:19.229]  Well, as American citizens under the Fourth Amendment, we all are honorable and innocent until proven guilty, but now 99% of us are guilty until proven innocent, but if you're a big shot currently in government, you're then exempt.
[01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:21.370]  I mean, that's classical tyranny.
[01:39:24.818 --> 01:39:25.459]  I don't know.
[01:39:47.947 --> 01:39:54.012]  Well, what about the guy with the urine bag that they pulled off his body?
[01:39:54.012 --> 01:39:55.854]  His medical prosthesis.
[01:39:55.854 --> 01:39:57.856]  What about... I've seen it.
[01:39:57.856 --> 01:39:59.157]  I would imagine you fly a lot.
[01:39:59.157 --> 01:40:03.460]  You've seen it where old ladies that can't walk are made to get up out of their wheelchairs?
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:05.842]  Yeah, I mean, it's absurd.
[01:40:05.842 --> 01:40:08.745]  It's utterly... And you know what's interesting, Alex?
[01:40:08.745 --> 01:40:13.489]  What if they caught... You know if they caught someone, it would be headlines.
[01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:15.902]  Well, you know they got the underwear bomber.
[01:40:15.902 --> 01:40:16.324]  The U.S.
[01:40:16.324 --> 01:40:18.072]  government ordered him to be allowed on the plane.
[01:40:20.058 --> 01:40:21.338]  And who have they caught?
[01:40:21.338 --> 01:40:22.419]  Nobody.
[01:40:22.419 --> 01:40:22.939]  Nobody.
[01:40:22.939 --> 01:40:28.680]  I mean, do they really think the terrorists are going to attack us in the identical same way?
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.882]  I mean, when I was in SEAL Team, we were trained never to do anything alike.
[01:40:34.882 --> 01:40:38.683]  You know, when you go in one way, you come out another way if you can.
[01:40:38.683 --> 01:40:45.725]  Like in the daytime, if you run ops at night, you wear those test-firing weapons every day.
[01:40:45.725 --> 01:40:47.585]  That way you're not setting any patterns.
[01:40:48.085 --> 01:40:48.726]  We're good to go.
[01:41:07.588 --> 01:41:20.200]  Well, Governor, does this not set the precedent, though, that they can put federal forces on highways, at bus terminals, at train stations, at airports, under this omnipresent threat?
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:31.751]  And then we learn that Ammar al-Awlaki, Fox News headline in October, the number two in Al-Qaeda, meeting secretly at the Pentagon while he is on the wanted list.
[01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:32.672]  Did you see that report?
[01:41:35.027 --> 01:41:48.118]  If guys put that Amarillo Lockheed dying secretly at the Pentagon report up, and that got leaked and they confirmed it was real, I mean, Governor, you've talked about 9-11, the explosives clearly in the towers, all the evidence of that.
[01:41:48.118 --> 01:41:51.880]  I mean, more and more, 9-11 is the pretext to destroy our liberties.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.582]  And you know what's interesting?
[01:41:53.582 --> 01:41:56.884]  Now we can segue to the book a little here, Alex.
[01:41:56.884 --> 01:42:00.147]  We print the NIST report on Building 7.
[01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:01.248]  Would you admit it?
[01:42:03.175 --> 01:42:05.157]  They admit Building 7 was demoed.
[01:42:05.157 --> 01:42:07.278]  You know how they admit it?
[01:42:07.278 --> 01:42:11.101]  They said that it went into total free-fall for this many seconds.
[01:42:11.101 --> 01:42:17.967]  Well, that it had to be demoed because otherwise they're defying Newton's Law of Gravity Physics.
[01:42:17.967 --> 01:42:27.574]  The only way a building like that can go into total free-fall, which it says in the NIST report, is to have all resistance removed.
[01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:30.096]  And the only way you can remove the resistance
[01:42:33.114 --> 01:42:43.040]  Well, you're absolutely right, and for eight years they tried to say that there was no free fall until the videos forced them to prove the fact that it did fall.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.002]  Well, if they could prove it, they could put it on the stopwatch.
[01:42:46.002 --> 01:42:50.585]  The buildings fell as fast as I would jump out of an airplane and free fall.
[01:42:50.585 --> 01:42:59.231]  And the stopwatch will tell you that because you can calculate it simply by the amount of seconds that the buildings fell and how many feet it fell.
[01:43:01.986 --> 01:43:06.508]  And we did the timing for eight plus years, and they said we were conspiracy theorists.
[01:43:06.508 --> 01:43:12.711]  But later, when they were confronted with it, they had to admit, yes, it fell at freefall.
[01:43:12.711 --> 01:43:23.516]  And every demolition expert out there, including yourself, in the underwater demolition team, will tell you that you would have an asymmetrical collapse if it was caused by fire.
[01:43:23.516 --> 01:43:25.617]  And that itself had never happened until 9-11.
[01:43:32.892 --> 01:43:45.167]  And of course we also, we go into on 9-11, I devoted an entire chapter of course, we go into something I'm sure you're well aware of, the Pentagon Stand-by Order.
[01:43:46.892 --> 01:43:48.413]  I want to talk about that in a moment.
[01:43:48.413 --> 01:43:54.858]  Let me just read some of the 63 documents that are in this book and that are broken down.
[01:43:54.858 --> 01:43:57.320]  I mean, you talk about a well-written book.
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:08.088]  I mean, this thing 100% proves just how criminal these shadowy organizations that Fletcher Prouty wrote about and just how out of control and hubris-filled they are.
[01:44:08.088 --> 01:44:10.510]  You have our scandalous post-war history.
[01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:11.831]  That's 11 of the documents.
[01:44:11.831 --> 01:44:14.153]  Government, military, and corporate secrets.
[01:44:14.953 --> 01:44:17.154]  That's another 15 documents or so.
[01:44:17.154 --> 01:44:20.416]  Shady White House, another 10 documents.
[01:44:20.416 --> 01:44:25.398]  You've got Part 4, 9-11, a think tank anticipation of 9-11.
[01:44:25.398 --> 01:44:27.959]  FBI knowledge of terrorist training at flight schools.
[01:44:27.959 --> 01:44:29.820]  Bin Laden determined to strike in the U.S.
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:31.441]  Bush told, lied about it.
[01:44:31.441 --> 01:44:33.061]  The Pentagon's stand down order.
[01:44:33.061 --> 01:44:36.443]  The Free Fall Building 7, evidence for insider stock trading.
[01:44:36.943 --> 01:44:37.344]  I don't
[01:44:54.225 --> 01:44:58.526]  One of these points discredits this shadow government COG system.
[01:44:58.526 --> 01:45:06.368]  You've got 63 of them, and the way you put them together, everybody has got to get this book and give it to doubting Thomases that they know.
[01:45:06.368 --> 01:45:11.309]  I mean, Jesse, you have engaged in a quantum leap with this book.
[01:45:11.309 --> 01:45:13.690]  I mean, I don't think anybody's ever put something together like this.
[01:45:19.577 --> 01:45:20.337]  We're good to go.
[01:45:54.410 --> 01:46:02.278]  This should be required reading in every high school, every university, every police chief, anyone who's ever been in denial.
[01:46:02.278 --> 01:46:08.664]  The way it's so well written, the way it's so well blurbed and factoided on each piece, starting at page 38,
[01:46:10.725 --> 01:46:21.235]  You've got Operation Northwoods, or actually Document 38, and then you turn the page, that's the US government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[01:46:21.235 --> 01:46:30.804]  Then, once you've read that document, you get to something that we first found and dug out in 2004 and put in my film, Martial Law.
[01:46:30.804 --> 01:46:33.147]  You have the stand-down order to Cheney
[01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:42.593]  Uh, given over, uh, to, uh, Rumsfeld to change, uh, NORAD's, uh, preparation to shoot down Aaron Aircraft.
[01:46:42.593 --> 01:46:43.774]  You were trying to get to that, Governor.
[01:46:43.774 --> 01:46:44.214]  Break it down.
[01:46:48.249 --> 01:46:49.329]  We're good to go.
[01:47:05.115 --> 01:47:21.629]  Well, on executive order from George Bush, June of 2001 rescinded that order, and it stated that no planes could be scrambled up in the air without approval of the Department of Defense, the DOD.
[01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:28.034]  So in essence, then, you would have a stand-down simply by Donald Rumsfeld not answering the
[01:47:36.638 --> 01:47:42.102]  And Cheney was hiding out of the bunker and lied and said he got there 45 minutes later than he had.
[01:47:42.102 --> 01:47:56.754]  But Norman Panetta, the head of transportation, confirmed in five separate interviews and before Congress that Cheney was lying about being in there and saying the order still stood to basically not shoot down Flight 77 coming into the Pentagon.
[01:47:56.754 --> 01:48:01.617]  And here is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff order for the stand down.
[01:48:02.378 --> 01:48:22.146]  from June 1st issued under the vice president's orders through Rumsfeld and then right after 9-11 they rescinded their previous order and went back to the old shoot-down directive where the generals didn't have to get authorization before they shot down an errant aircraft and they were begging that day let us shoot them down but they wouldn't give them the order.
[01:48:24.025 --> 01:48:24.986]  What do you say?
[01:48:24.986 --> 01:48:27.047]  It's as clear as the nose on your face.
[01:48:27.047 --> 01:48:31.709]  And like I said, for the rest of doubt, read it yourself.
[01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:35.512]  You know, you can read the orders yourself and you'll see what happened.
[01:48:35.512 --> 01:48:42.415]  You know, the other thing that really, the document that really bothered me too, Alex, is the first one.
[01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:46.498]  The CIA Secret Assassination Manual.
[01:48:46.498 --> 01:48:51.861]  Now, assassination is just a nice word for first degree murder.
[01:48:53.081 --> 01:48:56.884]  It's pre-planned, and it's generally politically inclined.
[01:48:56.884 --> 01:49:11.993]  Now, how can our government have a manual, a printed manual, on how to commit first-degree murder, when as far as I know, murder is illegal in every country in the world, and yet we have a manual.
[01:49:11.993 --> 01:49:14.755]  And wait till you read this thing, all you viewers out there.
[01:49:14.955 --> 01:49:16.336]  I don't know if they read it.
[01:49:16.336 --> 01:49:23.160]  I mean, it tells, you know, what type of person they'll recruit to do the murders, what his mindset should be.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:26.042]  One of the problems, you have to laugh at it.
[01:49:26.042 --> 01:49:32.786]  Like they say, throwing people off of buildings or high places is excellent because there's so much plausible denial.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:40.005]  Look, I tend to think I know it all, but the older I get, I know how much I don't know.
[01:49:40.005 --> 01:49:46.171]  Reading your book, we got it three weeks ago but couldn't start shipping it until this week, I couldn't put it down.
[01:49:46.171 --> 01:49:52.237]  I ended up staying up until about three in the morning, started at about nine at night, wasn't done until three in the morning reading the whole book.
[01:49:52.617 --> 01:49:54.638]  And there were a lot of documents that I'd never seen.
[01:49:54.638 --> 01:49:58.500]  I went and looked them up on the National Archives and there they were, declassified.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:10.287]  This is a literal Rosetta Stone to understand the criminal pathology of this Anglo-American secret team, rogue network group that Fletcher Prouty wrote about.
[01:50:10.287 --> 01:50:16.410]  And talking to you four or five months ago, the last time you were on, Governor, you talked about Prouty and his view into the world.
[01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:23.460]  And I see a lot of Prouty's understanding overall, almost like his spirit is hanging over this book.
[01:50:26.852 --> 01:50:28.912]  I'm so proud he was a great American.
[01:50:28.912 --> 01:50:36.674]  You know, he served his country honorably, and he saw what things were wrong, and he wasn't afraid to come out and write about them.
[01:50:36.674 --> 01:50:42.696]  Even though his one book, The Secret Team, back in 72, when he initially printed that one, it was censored.
[01:50:42.696 --> 01:50:45.497]  Every time they do a printing, the U.S.
[01:50:45.497 --> 01:50:47.177]  government would buy up every copy.
[01:50:48.246 --> 01:50:53.093]  Sixty-three documents in full with all of the supporting documentation.
[01:50:53.093 --> 01:50:53.994]  Very well written.
[01:50:53.994 --> 01:50:57.759]  Sixty-three documents the government doesn't want you to read at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:57.759 --> 01:50:58.019]  Get it.
[01:50:58.019 --> 01:50:58.940]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.581]  Unlock minds.
[01:51:01.069 --> 01:51:02.390]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:07.972]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.972 --> 01:51:12.994]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.994 --> 01:51:18.016]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.556 --> 01:51:23.777]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:30.899]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.899 --> 01:51:32.019]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:32.019 --> 01:51:38.361]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.701 --> 01:51:41.882]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.882 --> 01:51:44.102]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:45.042 --> 01:51:45.243]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.243 --> 01:51:48.683]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.683 --> 01:51:50.424]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.586 --> 01:52:07.435]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:52:07.435 --> 01:52:09.037]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:52:09.037 --> 01:52:16.888]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom, 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:52:17.108 --> 01:52:25.034]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation.
[01:52:25.034 --> 01:52:26.115]  What's going on as a nation?
[01:52:26.115 --> 01:52:28.897]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:52:28.897 --> 01:52:38.725]  Dr. Berry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:52:38.725 --> 01:52:40.426]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:52:40.426 --> 01:52:43.068]  They're not just economic, they're philosophical.
[01:52:43.068 --> 01:52:44.770]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:46.111]  There's philosophy involved in this book.

[01:53:00.293 --> 01:53:04.655]  Fear of falling is the number one reason seniors leave the home they love.
[01:53:04.655 --> 01:53:10.639]  And millions of aging Americans can no longer enjoy the pleasure of a simple bath from fear of falling.
[01:53:10.639 --> 01:53:11.679]  Don't leave your home.
[01:53:11.679 --> 01:53:12.960]  There is a solution.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.462]  The revolutionary Designed for Seniors Walk-In Tub.

[01:53:31.554 --> 01:53:32.676]  Built-in heating.
[01:53:32.676 --> 01:53:37.682]  Easy to reach controls with both water and air jet therapy to soothe away aches and pains.
[01:53:37.682 --> 01:53:42.307]  All tubs are proudly made in the USA and come with a limited lifetime warranty.

[01:53:49.916 --> 01:53:52.659]  The Designed for Seniors Walk-In Tub for boomers and beyond.
[01:54:08.393 --> 01:54:13.536]  You know, I'd forgotten to bring up, how is he doing his book tour if he won't fly on commercial planes?
[01:54:13.536 --> 01:54:17.918]  And the governor said, hey, final segment, you gotta have me, you know, tell folks about this.
[01:54:17.918 --> 01:54:19.159]  He's a man of his word.
[01:54:19.159 --> 01:54:21.340]  How is he gonna do the TV show this season?
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.441]  So let me segue with that.
[01:54:22.441 --> 01:54:27.664]  How are you getting around the country if you're not flying and going through the Gestapo blockade?
[01:54:27.664 --> 01:54:30.425]  And is the TV show coming back for another hit season?
[01:54:30.425 --> 01:54:36.589]  Well, first of all, I'm getting around the country because I informed my publishers, of course, of the lawsuit.
[01:54:39.614 --> 01:54:40.454]  We're good to go.
[01:55:04.158 --> 01:55:05.740]  Well, it's like Rosa Parks.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:07.642]  She said, I'm not sitting at the back of the bus.
[01:55:07.642 --> 01:55:12.907]  You're saying you're not going to stick your hands in my pants or grab my, you know, my Johnson.
[01:55:12.907 --> 01:55:14.169]  I mean, that makes perfect sense.
[01:55:14.169 --> 01:55:17.012]  This is bigger than Rosa Parks having to sit at the back of the bus.
[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:28.242]  Let me read a quote from Patrick Henry.
[01:56:04.444 --> 01:56:09.165]  And your book exposes that and is a major torpedo at that line.
[01:56:09.165 --> 01:56:13.347]  In closing here though, just to be sure that as you were telling me privately, it's probably coming back.
[01:56:13.347 --> 01:56:15.948]  When will we know if the third season's back?
[01:56:22.136 --> 01:56:24.418]  What new conspiracies do you have?
[01:56:24.418 --> 01:56:29.564]  And Ty and them sent them about 25 or whatever, and they sent back the 8 that they want to do.
[01:56:31.246 --> 01:56:34.167]  They have not officially picked it up yet.
[01:56:34.167 --> 01:56:42.448]  You know, and I know, having worked in Hollywood, you never believe anything's going to happen until it actually does.
[01:56:42.448 --> 01:56:48.870]  Everything is looking positive for a third season, but you never know until they officially pick it up.
[01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:54.391]  Well, I hope they do, because I love the original work you're doing and consulting and also getting to hang out with you.
[01:56:54.391 --> 01:56:55.971]  You're such a great patriot.
[01:56:55.971 --> 01:56:58.372]  Jesse Ventura, always wonderful having you on.
[01:56:58.372 --> 01:57:00.132]  Last question, we've only got a minute and a half left.
[01:57:05.922 --> 01:57:09.445]  Oh, you did it first by buying me those cigars.
[01:57:09.445 --> 01:57:10.426]  Those are some good ones, though.
[01:57:10.426 --> 01:57:11.247]  You recommended those.
[01:57:11.247 --> 01:57:12.508]  That's now my favorite cigar.
[01:57:12.508 --> 01:57:13.629]  Oh, it is.
[01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:15.411]  It's the Aston Capitan VSG.
[01:57:15.411 --> 01:57:16.952]  It's the best cigar on the planet.
[01:57:16.952 --> 01:57:18.393]  All right, all right.
[01:57:18.393 --> 01:57:25.280]  In the minute and a half we got left, would you consider running as a third-party person with somebody like Ralph Nader or someone else you admire?
[01:57:34.175 --> 01:57:36.097]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:57:36.097 --> 01:57:39.180]  That is a match made in victory.
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:40.141]  What about Donald Trump?
[01:57:40.141 --> 01:57:41.823]  He looks like he's going to run.
[01:57:41.823 --> 01:57:43.244]  He's got a lot of money.
[01:57:57.678 --> 01:57:58.539]  I know Donald.
[01:57:58.539 --> 01:58:02.663]  Donald rattled his sword 10, 12 years ago about running.
[01:58:02.663 --> 01:58:05.105]  Donald is a glutton for publicity.
[01:58:05.105 --> 01:58:06.867]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:58:06.867 --> 01:58:10.370]  But he rattles his sword around all the time that he's gonna run.
[01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:15.235]  I will be astounded if Donald Trump literally runs.
[01:58:15.235 --> 01:58:17.137]  I think he'll rattle his sword around.
[01:58:17.137 --> 01:58:18.639]  He'll get a ton of publicity.
[01:58:18.639 --> 01:58:20.901]  He gets to go on all the TV shows and stuff.
[01:58:22.813 --> 01:58:23.934]  He won't do it.
[01:58:23.934 --> 01:58:27.737]  Governor, so you're saying to Ron Paul, you're waiting, you're waiting to get that phone call.
[01:58:27.737 --> 01:58:32.120]  I just said I'd give it great consideration.
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:35.843]  Alright, Governor Ventura, we look forward to talking to you again in May or June.
[01:58:35.843 --> 01:58:37.904]  God bless you, and be safe on your tour.
[01:58:37.904 --> 01:58:43.028]  Okay, you too, Alex.
[01:58:43.028 --> 01:58:46.230]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.745 --> 01:58:55.288]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.288 --> 01:58:56.209]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.209 --> 01:58:59.631]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.631 --> 01:59:00.492]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.492 --> 01:59:05.395]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.395 --> 01:59:06.135]  It's true.
[01:59:06.135 --> 01:59:10.999]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.999 --> 01:59:11.839]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.839 --> 01:59:15.421]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.421 --> 01:59:19.104]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.324 --> 01:59:20.104]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.104 --> 01:59:22.865]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.865 --> 01:59:26.547]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.547 --> 01:59:27.347]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.347 --> 01:59:31.489]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.489 --> 01:59:36.551]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:00:10.332 --> 02:00:11.913]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.913 --> 02:00:13.474]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:17.657 --> 02:00:21.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.952 --> 02:00:39.435]  Okay, in this third hour on the heels of Governor Jesse Ben-Turib.
[02:00:39.435 --> 02:00:44.058]  A lot of breaking news and information about what's going on in his world and his view on things.
[02:00:44.058 --> 02:00:46.959]  Now that he's left us, I want to open the phones up.
[02:00:46.959 --> 02:00:51.301]  For the entire next hour, the toll-free number to join us is 800-259.

[02:00:55.643 --> 02:01:02.587]  9231 will get you up and on the air.
[02:01:02.587 --> 02:01:20.697]  That said, I was not hyping the fact, you've heard me say his other books are excellent and got a lot of good information, but this new book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read, is particularly powerful and is perfect to wake people up.
[02:01:20.697 --> 02:01:21.818]  It is a page turner.
[02:01:23.018 --> 02:01:25.099]  And we are in an information war.
[02:01:25.099 --> 02:01:30.803]  You not only support Governor Ventura when you purchase it from us, you also support our operation, but that's the win-win.
[02:01:30.803 --> 02:01:39.848]  The real big win in those two wins is you get further informed and increase your knowledge, and then you can give the book to friends and family.
[02:01:41.837 --> 02:01:46.039]  And I also just want to add that we helped him with the printing cost.
[02:01:46.039 --> 02:01:48.100]  We paid to have it printed for Mark Dice.
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:51.022]  He's put out a whole bunch of books, but he's always done print-on-demand.
[02:01:51.022 --> 02:01:54.664]  And we've tried to, you know, help Mark actually do this full-time.
[02:01:54.664 --> 02:01:56.185]  So I paid to print.
[02:01:56.185 --> 02:01:59.087]  Ten thousand of Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare, come true.
[02:01:59.847 --> 02:01:59.947]  Yes.
[02:02:19.525 --> 02:02:29.996]  With these two books when you get the two books so quite a discount and that also puts fuel in our information warfare coffers to continue the fight against the globalists.
[02:02:29.996 --> 02:02:38.224]  But I want to hear from you about the fact that they're now dumping this radiation filled water at 100,000 times safe levels directly in the Pacific.
[02:02:38.985 --> 02:02:44.750]  They are saying this could go on for several months before they even figure out how to fix it.
[02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:59.582]  More radiation is drifting over at 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine, 131, according to universities and state governments that have been doing the testing at a state-slash-university facility in Berkeley.
[02:02:59.582 --> 02:03:02.364]  Other state facilities are picking up similar readings.
[02:03:02.364 --> 02:03:07.469]  That's a big deal that it's a footnote in the New York Times, and they're not even telling people don't drink milk on the West Coast.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:16.223]  I know my wife noticed that the brand of organic milk we usually get is from California, and I said, why not pay 30 cents more and get the Texas brand?
[02:03:16.223 --> 02:03:17.904]  That was actually her idea.
[02:03:17.904 --> 02:03:18.885]  I said, that's a good idea.
[02:03:18.885 --> 02:03:23.406]  And then I had some of it, and I'm like, this tastes a lot better than the Southern California brand.
[02:03:23.406 --> 02:03:24.467]  I'm sorry, it just does.
[02:03:26.475 --> 02:03:37.921]  We gotta go to Whole Foods to get it, but the point is, is that I'm not, I mean, there's no doubt, there's no doubt that many of the cows are bioaccumulating radioactive isotopes and it's coming out in the milk.
[02:03:37.921 --> 02:03:45.445]  That was reported last Wednesday by the San Francisco Chronicle, the Oregonian, you name it, in case you just tuned in.
[02:03:45.445 --> 02:03:46.345]  There's no debating that.
[02:03:46.345 --> 02:03:50.788]  I want to get your views on that as well, your views on Senator Lindsey Graham.
[02:03:52.048 --> 02:03:53.090]  We're good to go.
[02:04:07.512 --> 02:04:10.415]  Dumb people, and they're right, as well as other people.
[02:04:10.415 --> 02:04:17.541]  Because one person who's dumb is a genius to somebody else, and free speech is free speech, and we're just more real estate if we don't have that.
[02:04:17.541 --> 02:04:21.304]  The globalists are abridging every major section of the first ten amendments.
[02:04:21.304 --> 02:04:26.828]  We've got to restore the republic, and that means restoring the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[02:04:26.828 --> 02:04:28.190]  I want to get your take on all this.
[02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:28.610]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:28.610 --> 02:04:28.650]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:36.016 --> 02:04:40.699]  That was a news-making interview with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[02:04:40.699 --> 02:04:47.264]  I'm going to make sure it gets posted in its entirety at PrisonPlanet.TV and then at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:04:47.264 --> 02:04:55.489]  But you can see it first at PrisonPlanet.TV and see it in higher quality and support what we're doing and plus all the films and more at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:04:55.489 --> 02:04:58.171]  Alright, we'll be right back with your phone calls and a ton of news.
[02:04:58.171 --> 02:04:58.612]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.902 --> 02:05:02.063]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:02.063 --> 02:05:08.987]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.987 --> 02:05:11.549]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.549 --> 02:05:16.933]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:16.933 --> 02:05:19.975]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:19.975 --> 02:05:22.036]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.276 --> 02:05:28.520]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:31.902]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:31.902 --> 02:05:37.685]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.685 --> 02:05:39.326]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.326 --> 02:05:40.627]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.627 --> 02:05:43.309]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.309 --> 02:05:47.531]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.531 --> 02:05:50.113]  You can find the video at www dot
[02:05:50.313 --> 02:05:52.135]  End of America 3.com.
[02:05:52.135 --> 02:05:54.717]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:05:54.717 --> 02:05:58.601]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:58.601 --> 02:05:59.602]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:00.931 --> 02:06:04.513]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.513 --> 02:06:05.633]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:05.633 --> 02:06:10.215]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.215 --> 02:06:16.157]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.157 --> 02:06:18.298]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.298 --> 02:06:21.339]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:21.339 --> 02:06:27.842]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:06:27.842 --> 02:06:29.623]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:06:30.043 --> 02:06:35.387]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:40.672]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:06:40.672 --> 02:06:46.036]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:06:46.036 --> 02:06:49.239]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:06:49.239 --> 02:06:52.241]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:52.241 --> 02:06:53.242]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:02.222 --> 02:07:04.424]  Subject to other police action.
[02:07:04.424 --> 02:07:05.685]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:05.685 --> 02:07:09.429]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.429 --> 02:07:11.871]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:11.871 --> 02:07:17.297]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:17.717 --> 02:07:24.401]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.401 --> 02:07:30.364]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.364 --> 02:07:34.046]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:38.830]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:44.776]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:44.776 --> 02:07:48.339]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.339 --> 02:07:50.321]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.321 --> 02:07:51.442]  It's here.

[02:08:02.375 --> 02:08:08.999]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.999 --> 02:08:11.981]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.128 --> 02:08:22.751]  We're now eight minutes into hour number three.
[02:08:22.751 --> 02:08:24.953]  I want to open the phones up.
[02:08:24.953 --> 02:08:29.898]  Obviously, the teleprompter reading, Puppet, Barack H. Obama.
[02:08:29.898 --> 02:08:33.822]  Real name Barry Sotero from Indonesia has announced he's going to run again.
[02:08:33.822 --> 02:08:38.166]  The coffers of the foreign bankers will fill him with the billion dollars he needs.
[02:08:39.895 --> 02:08:41.477]  We've got Lindsey Graham, the U.S.
[02:08:41.477 --> 02:08:52.508]  Senator, openly calling for restrictions on the First Amendment because of the Koran burning, saying it hurts our military operations.
[02:08:52.508 --> 02:08:59.156]  Well then, I remember when the first Gulf War started, a Neocon talk show host saying, arrest protesters, they're hurting the war effort.
[02:08:59.696 --> 02:09:02.558]  I mean, these people really don't want freedom in this country.
[02:09:02.558 --> 02:09:03.779]  We're the country.
[02:09:03.779 --> 02:09:04.900]  We decide.
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.181]  These wars aren't declared.
[02:09:06.181 --> 02:09:07.322]  They're illegal.
[02:09:07.322 --> 02:09:10.084]  Al Qaeda is a globalist banker creation.
[02:09:10.084 --> 02:09:12.946]  Our military is used to empower the world government.
[02:09:12.946 --> 02:09:15.067]  And our name is destroyed in the process.
[02:09:15.067 --> 02:09:16.649]  And our treasure is used up.
[02:09:16.649 --> 02:09:18.150]  And we lose our young men and women.
[02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:30.087]  I'm sick of all this fake warmongering moralizing about how they're doing this to Gaddafi because he might have hurt some protesters while their allies in Yemen are mowing people down and Fox News is defending it.
[02:09:31.656 --> 02:09:33.957]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:09:33.957 --> 02:09:44.121]  They are reporting 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine showing up at the University of Berkeley where they tested the tap water through a state-funded facility.
[02:09:44.121 --> 02:09:47.683]  Similar numbers are coming out in other states on the West Coast.
[02:09:47.683 --> 02:09:51.705]  Gold rises to near $1,435 as the dollar retreats.
[02:09:51.705 --> 02:09:52.785]  Oil climbs.
[02:09:52.785 --> 02:09:56.107]  Feds seek $7 million in privately made Liberty dollars.
[02:09:56.107 --> 02:09:56.567]  The Feds
[02:09:57.602 --> 02:10:03.023]  They're now trying to seize Liberty Dollars, which are just, anybody can go print up their own silver or gold coins.
[02:10:03.023 --> 02:10:05.844]  There's thousands of different commemorative coin companies.
[02:10:05.844 --> 02:10:14.365]  And in the ruling, they warn here that this sets the precedent to ban barter or private currency, something Cities and others have had.
[02:10:14.365 --> 02:10:25.648]  And when you go and cash in money at Chuck E. Cheese's to get the little card or whatever, or at Dave & Buster's to put $20 in tokens on it, that's a form of alternate money.
[02:10:25.648 --> 02:10:27.108]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:10:27.648 --> 02:10:29.850]  This company's been around for 15 years.
[02:10:29.850 --> 02:10:31.292]  I've got some Liberty Dollars.
[02:10:31.292 --> 02:10:35.036]  I've got some silver ones that go back to the mid-90s.
[02:10:35.036 --> 02:10:39.541]  Now they sell for hundreds of dollars for a one-ounce coin because nobody can get them.
[02:10:40.842 --> 02:10:42.303]  And they're trying to put him in prison.
[02:10:42.303 --> 02:10:44.945]  So I'm going to be breaking that down as well.
[02:10:44.945 --> 02:10:51.050]  Another example of just extreme hubris, Gulf Spill Company hands out safety bonuses.
[02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:52.932]  Company whose rig caused biggest oil spill in U.S.
[02:10:52.932 --> 02:10:56.135]  history rewards executives for best year in safety performance.
[02:10:56.135 --> 02:10:57.536]  Last year when this happened.
[02:10:57.536 --> 02:10:59.678]  Can't make up that hubris.
[02:10:59.678 --> 02:11:05.542]  We're also going to be getting in to some other important news dealing with the economy.
[02:11:05.542 --> 02:11:07.864]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:11:07.864 --> 02:11:09.566]  David in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:11:11.328 --> 02:11:13.108]  Hey Alex, you there?
[02:11:13.108 --> 02:11:14.789]  Yeah, sure am, right here.
[02:11:14.789 --> 02:11:15.469]  Alright, nice.
[02:11:15.469 --> 02:11:18.210]  Yeah, I was just calling.
[02:11:18.210 --> 02:11:24.531]  Wanted to tell you, I went to the Bohemian Grove about, I guess it was a few years before you did.
[02:11:24.531 --> 02:11:28.192]  They have weddings there.
[02:11:28.192 --> 02:11:29.893]  Have you heard of that?
[02:11:29.893 --> 02:11:38.235]  When it's not shut down in the month of July, some of the private groups are allowed to have weddings there, I believe, with members.
[02:11:39.113 --> 02:11:41.153]  Yeah, yeah, and that's exactly what it was.
[02:11:41.153 --> 02:12:06.258]  It was a family member of mine and we went in and when you get there, like you said, they loaded us up on those big army trucks and took us to the main point and from there, you know, we went to, it's pretty much the main building met like where the bar is and they have a big redwood tree that comes in the middle of the bar out the roof.
[02:12:07.305 --> 02:12:13.469]  And then they took us on a tour of the place and showed us where the atom bomb was supposedly, you know, designed.
[02:12:13.469 --> 02:12:16.471]  Yeah, that's up on the hilltop, the Chalet building.
[02:12:16.471 --> 02:12:17.532]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:17.532 --> 02:12:21.855]  And then on your episode with that Decoded.
[02:12:21.855 --> 02:12:22.275]  Yes.
[02:12:22.275 --> 02:12:29.640]  When you guys went down that river, they actually took us to a guard shack up there that overlooked the whole Russian River.
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:31.762]  Yeah, it's right above the little bridge.
[02:12:31.762 --> 02:12:31.962]  Yep.
[02:12:32.585 --> 02:12:33.286]  Well, I didn't really go in.
[02:12:33.286 --> 02:12:34.787]  The crew went in and then ran from the guards and got arrested.
[02:12:34.787 --> 02:12:38.309]  I just followed them up to the waterline and by then, basically, they got grabbed and I didn't.
[02:12:38.309 --> 02:12:38.950]  I got out of there.
[02:12:58.362 --> 02:12:59.123]  I didn't know.
[02:12:59.123 --> 02:13:02.324]  I knew it was exclusive and ex-presidents and everything else.
[02:13:02.324 --> 02:13:04.926]  I didn't have a clue what it is that I know today.
[02:13:04.926 --> 02:13:11.469]  It's not just ex-presidents, it's current presidents have been known to go there.
[02:13:11.469 --> 02:13:16.872]  Going back to William Howard Taft right around 1900 or 1901.
[02:13:16.872 --> 02:13:20.254]  But did you see Mollick, the big stone idol?
[02:13:20.254 --> 02:13:20.534]  Didn't.
[02:13:21.718 --> 02:13:23.540]  No, I missed that.
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:24.540]  That would have been great.
[02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:25.461]  That was the one thing.
[02:13:25.461 --> 02:13:26.442]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:13:26.442 --> 02:13:27.563]  Hey Alex, first off, I just wanted to
[02:13:40.730 --> 02:13:44.871]  Let me ask you about this play on words.
[02:13:44.871 --> 02:13:49.452]  You know, we're typically in four wars right now.
[02:13:49.452 --> 02:13:56.014]  My first question to you is, how many wars or countries do we have to invade before it's considered a world war?
[02:13:56.014 --> 02:14:09.378]  And second, my observation of Mr. fake birth certificate Obama, all I've heard from him is speech after speech
[02:14:09.978 --> 02:14:10.658]  Yeah, he has.
[02:14:10.658 --> 02:14:15.519]  And that's because he's a puppet and the bankers are finally bleeding us completely out.
[02:14:15.519 --> 02:14:18.420]  But going back to your first question, what was your first question?
[02:14:33.174 --> 02:14:46.557]  Well, um, you used a certain term and it was kind of weird, I never heard it before, what you were calling these, well they call it a police action in Vietnam, but now they're calling it some other kind of military action.
[02:14:46.557 --> 02:15:00.221]  They're calling it a kinetic action, they're saying it's not a war, it's kinetic when we drop bombs and send in special forces, those are not ground forces, they're just on the ground, and I appreciate your call, it's an excellent point, Tim.
[02:15:01.161 --> 02:15:12.826]  Going back and expanding on this, this isn't really so much the start of World War 3, or a lot of people at the CIA called the Cold War, World War 3.
[02:15:12.826 --> 02:15:16.167]  This isn't really the start of World War 4, though it could lead to that.
[02:15:16.167 --> 02:15:24.691]  What it is, is a NATO, globalist, Anglo-American establishment invasion of third world countries that they wanted to overthrow.
[02:15:24.691 --> 02:15:29.733]  So it's a neo-colonial, imperial, multi-pronged invasion
[02:15:30.333 --> 02:15:46.328]  With a new system they're using where they openly finance rebels to overthrow governments and when the rebels succeed they come in and take over behind them or if they don't succeed they give them air power and weapons and ground advisors.
[02:15:47.381 --> 02:15:51.545]  And so it's really not new in history, but it's new in the last few decades.
[02:15:51.545 --> 02:15:53.487]  And then they call it humanitarian.
[02:15:53.487 --> 02:15:58.772]  Then when their other dictators are murdering their public, they call it loving and good and fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:58.772 --> 02:16:03.717]  But then when they're fighting Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, they say Al-Qaeda is good.
[02:16:03.717 --> 02:16:07.921]  But then when they're fighting Al-Qaeda in another country, Al-Qaeda is bad.
[02:16:07.921 --> 02:16:11.504]  And it's just basically the globalists are a private corporate crime network.
[02:16:12.285 --> 02:16:14.706]  I mean, it's a one-size-fits-all system that they use.
[02:16:31.923 --> 02:16:42.209]  The 888 situation in 2008 with the NATO-backed attack on the Russian-controlled enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[02:16:42.209 --> 02:16:49.593]  The Russians just rolled nuke, mobile nuke platforms in and their chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff came out and said we're preparing to use nuclear weapons on you.
[02:16:49.593 --> 02:16:55.256]  Pull back as NATO forces landed to back up the humanitarian force and the globalists blinked and backed off.
[02:16:55.776 --> 02:16:59.618]  The Russians rolled in nukes and said, we're preparing to fire nuclear weapons.
[02:16:59.618 --> 02:17:03.920]  They had their chairman go on television and say, this is an act of aggression.
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:05.761]  We're preparing for nuclear warfare.
[02:17:05.761 --> 02:17:07.962]  We're going to start with tactical weapons.
[02:17:07.962 --> 02:17:10.804]  And if you respond to those, we're going to launch ICBMs basically.
[02:17:12.051 --> 02:17:16.394]  And Dick Cheney, who started it, later it came out, was the one that ran it, said, whoa!
[02:17:16.394 --> 02:17:18.756]  They had NATO, they had Israelis, they had U.S.
[02:17:18.756 --> 02:17:23.640]  forces advising the puppet minion in Georgia.
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:25.742]  And again, I'm not saying the Russians are good either.
[02:17:25.742 --> 02:17:29.785]  The point is, the globalists are just out of their minds trying to start World War III.
[02:17:31.505 --> 02:17:31.765]  Hi Alex.
[02:17:31.765 --> 02:17:35.567]  First of all, I just want to say that with regards to the comment of Senator Lindsey Graham of amending the First Amendment
[02:17:56.758 --> 02:18:08.963]  I say that the American people should realize that once this fellow, and anyone who supports him, does this, and we agree to it, then that's the end of our Bill of Rights.
[02:18:08.963 --> 02:18:22.428]  And I agree that, you know, that we have been lied to for a very long time about the wars, the illegal wars that's happening now in Libya, the war in Afghanistan, why in the world should
[02:18:23.533 --> 02:18:39.386]  You know, a country like us, who declares us to be, you know, patriotic and, you know, who, you know, campaign for freedom and liberty and justice, be involved in wars that we're not supposed to be in.
[02:18:39.386 --> 02:18:52.798]  The life that the current president says that he's going to pull out troops and bring them home, you know, I feel that, you know, the young men and women that's fighting, thinking that they're fighting for the truth and justice and equality,
[02:18:53.433 --> 02:19:05.457]  They're not there to fight those kind of objectives, but they were there as a pawn, you know, in bringing so much pain and misery, not only to their family, but to our country.
[02:19:05.457 --> 02:19:18.562]  So I just hope that something would be done about this, and I hope that you and all of you that who profess the truth be, you know, be protected and be blessed by God.
[02:19:19.346 --> 02:19:19.866]  Well, thank you.
[02:19:19.866 --> 02:19:21.747]  I appreciate the call, Francis.
[02:19:21.747 --> 02:19:40.636]  Look, if they're able to set the precedent saying that this is inciting and not make it about the people burning and chopping heads off and shooting people in Afghanistan, but make it about this pastor burning the Koran after he put it on trial, now he's going to put Muhammad on trial and burn an effigy.
[02:19:40.636 --> 02:19:47.239]  And these Muslim countries, most of them don't have any liberties, but their government will back off if they go wild over religion.
[02:19:48.174 --> 02:19:49.998]  This is what the globalists want.
[02:19:49.998 --> 02:19:56.310]  It turned out CIA back groups published those images of Mohammed, you know, with the bomb on his head.
[02:19:56.310 --> 02:20:00.137]  That was done to get the Muslims riled up, because they want to have a war with them.
[02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:05.241]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[02:20:05.241 --> 02:20:10.385]  Now experience a new lifestyle and try vaping with e-cigarettes by Lecig.

[02:21:03.314 --> 02:21:05.656]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:21:05.656 --> 02:21:06.216]  The U.S.
[02:21:06.216 --> 02:21:13.501]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:21:13.501 --> 02:21:16.203]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:21:16.203 --> 02:21:19.545]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:21:19.545 --> 02:21:26.189]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:21:26.189 --> 02:21:28.851]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:21:28.851 --> 02:21:29.711]  Treasuries.
[02:21:29.711 --> 02:21:31.993]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association
[02:21:32.153 --> 02:21:32.894]  We're good to go.
[02:21:59.892 --> 02:22:01.192]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:22:01.192 --> 02:22:06.794]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:22:06.794 --> 02:22:11.816]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:22:11.816 --> 02:22:12.296]  It's true.
[02:22:12.296 --> 02:22:16.838]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:22:17.378 --> 02:22:22.602]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:22.602 --> 02:22:24.923]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:22:24.923 --> 02:22:29.706]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:22:29.706 --> 02:22:30.827]  And here's the best part.
[02:22:30.827 --> 02:22:33.909]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:22:33.909 --> 02:22:37.532]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:22:37.532 --> 02:22:40.714]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:22:40.714 --> 02:22:42.935]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:22:42.935 --> 02:22:43.856]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:22:47.578 --> 02:22:51.721]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:22:51.721 --> 02:22:56.564]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:22:56.564 --> 02:22:58.946]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:59.707 --> 02:23:03.128]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:23:03.128 --> 02:23:10.951]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:23:10.951 --> 02:23:15.512]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:23:15.512 --> 02:23:16.952]  It is glutathione.
[02:23:16.952 --> 02:23:21.014]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:23:21.014 --> 02:23:24.375]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:23:25.015 --> 02:23:30.800]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:38.047]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:38.047 --> 02:23:42.911]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:23:44.472 --> 02:23:46.875]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[02:23:46.875 --> 02:23:47.315]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.315 --> 02:23:47.515]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:47.515 --> 02:23:48.797]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:23:48.797 --> 02:23:49.958]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:24:17.105 --> 02:24:19.807]  Okay, we're continuing with your phone calls.
[02:24:19.807 --> 02:24:22.530]  Coming up, I have a trailer for a new video game.
[02:24:22.530 --> 02:24:39.244]  I've literally seen 10, 15, I don't know, I haven't counted them up, video game trailers the last few years, pushing the idea of UN invasions of America, world government, tyranny, poisoning the drinking water.
[02:24:40.558 --> 02:24:42.739]  Eugenics.
[02:24:42.739 --> 02:24:43.840]  You can look at this two ways.
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:46.801]  Are the video game producers fans of this show?
[02:24:46.801 --> 02:24:56.326]  Yes, a lot of them are and have contacted me, and there's little blurbs and nods to this show in many video games that we've listed before.
[02:24:56.326 --> 02:25:00.368]  Or you can look at it that some of these big companies are basically trying to acclimate people.
[02:25:00.368 --> 02:25:03.750]  That's coming up for a little bit in the next segment, along with some news.
[02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:06.291]  But right now, let's go to Tony in Oklahoma.
[02:25:06.291 --> 02:25:07.152]  Tony, thanks for holding.
[02:25:08.674 --> 02:25:09.635]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[02:25:09.635 --> 02:25:11.377]  I appreciate you having me on your show.
[02:25:11.377 --> 02:25:18.485]  First, I'd like to say thank you so much for the quality of the guests that you bring on your show.
[02:25:18.485 --> 02:25:22.609]  Just the depth of the conversation that you bring is great.
[02:25:22.609 --> 02:25:24.731]  You listen to other shows or television shows.
[02:25:26.104 --> 02:25:29.086]  It's just fast, fast, boom, boom, boom, talking head.
[02:25:29.086 --> 02:25:38.330]  And the conservative shows just freak out over Muslims and how scary they are and how dangerous they are and give up all your rights for hour after hour.
[02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:39.951]  It just gets old.
[02:25:39.951 --> 02:25:44.493]  And then meanwhile, the Muslim extremists work for the globalists on record.
[02:25:44.493 --> 02:25:45.654]  Exactly.
[02:25:45.654 --> 02:25:48.615]  Well, thank you for having Mr. Ventura on.
[02:25:48.615 --> 02:25:49.856]  That was an incredible hour.
[02:25:49.856 --> 02:25:51.837]  I enjoyed that so much.
[02:25:51.837 --> 02:25:55.279]  One of the reasons I called was I wanted to see what your take was on
[02:25:56.161 --> 02:26:08.111]  A lot of the companies and corporations that are working overseas and support roles for the military and like Afghanistan and Iraq and what your take on all that was?
[02:26:08.111 --> 02:26:11.414]  I'm probably heading that way in about a month myself.
[02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:15.024]  Well, you know, my view is I've got a family to feed and my company took a major hit last year.
[02:26:15.024 --> 02:26:15.484]  It just tanked.
[02:26:38.334 --> 02:26:44.436]  I got hit by a lot of contractors that slow paid me and I've got... Well, that's what a managed economy does.
[02:26:44.436 --> 02:26:47.537]  The only money for scholarships is police state stuff.
[02:26:47.537 --> 02:26:50.338]  The only money for government contracts is the empire.
[02:26:50.338 --> 02:26:56.940]  They basically, if you're not an Obama supporter, you don't get the waiver on your insurance for your employees.
[02:26:56.940 --> 02:27:00.181]  That's what an organized command and control economy is about.
[02:27:00.181 --> 02:27:01.701]  That's what fascism is about.
[02:27:01.701 --> 02:27:03.402]  Go ahead.
[02:27:03.402 --> 02:27:04.922]  Yeah, you're exactly right about that.
[02:27:04.922 --> 02:27:07.223]  And it's put me in a position that I've got to do what I've got to do.
[02:27:09.313 --> 02:27:12.275]  Unfortunately, you know, it takes me away from my family for an extended period of time.
[02:27:12.275 --> 02:27:19.801]  One of the other questions that I had for you was some background information on HAARP.
[02:27:19.801 --> 02:27:22.423]  Where would I look for that on the internet?
[02:27:22.423 --> 02:27:27.647]  Well, we interviewed the director of HAARP a few years ago, and we re-aired that and re-posted it on InfoWars.com.
[02:27:27.647 --> 02:27:31.811]  Just search Alex Jones Interviews, Director of HAARP.
[02:27:31.811 --> 02:27:37.856]  We've got Dr. Nick Begich's book and his video available at InfoWars.com that break all of that down.
[02:27:39.476 --> 02:27:49.638]  Really, just type harpinfowars.com and you'll get reliable reports and information, not conspiracy theories, about what these types of technologies do.
[02:27:49.638 --> 02:28:03.261]  But now, there's mainstream news articles admitting that Arab countries, China, the Russians, they use similar harp arrays and admit it's for weather modification.
[02:28:03.261 --> 02:28:05.462]  So, a lot of that's now public.
[02:28:06.536 --> 02:28:11.038]  Well, I'm a new listener, and I've never heard anything about that before, and I was just like, wow, this is very interesting.
[02:28:11.038 --> 02:28:13.099]  So I wanted to do some research on that.
[02:28:13.099 --> 02:28:25.684]  And then one comment I'd like to make, and I thank you for letting me stay on, I wonder if there's not so many people, I've been talking about the things that you share for 20 years, and people look at me like I'm a nut job, and I'm like, well, you know, whatever.
[02:28:25.684 --> 02:28:30.826]  But anyway, do you think so many people in America today are just, they're so
[02:28:31.846 --> 02:28:35.168]  Deeply invested in the system that they're afraid of the truth?
[02:28:35.168 --> 02:28:36.449]  They don't even want to know the truth?
[02:28:49.876 --> 02:28:55.257]  As as reactive spectators, not as leaders, not as people that have power.
[02:28:55.257 --> 02:28:58.378]  People feel isolated.
[02:28:58.378 --> 02:29:02.739]  All they do is watch TV, don't even hang out with their neighbors.
[02:29:02.739 --> 02:29:04.440]  And so people are so isolated.
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:11.321]  And the global social engineers know that everything's compartmentalized and that people have a limited wide spectrum understanding.
[02:29:11.321 --> 02:29:12.742]  So they play on that.
[02:29:12.742 --> 02:29:16.663]  And that's how they're able to feed people more and more lies and disinformation.
[02:29:16.663 --> 02:29:16.903]  But
[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:20.264]  A separation is happening.
[02:29:20.264 --> 02:29:28.939]  One large group of people is growing and becoming more informed, but others that want to believe the lie, they're getting deeper into the lie and believing more and more of it.
[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:32.200]  They don't count.
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:35.782]  In the Revolutionary War, it was 5% that started it and won it.
[02:29:35.782 --> 02:29:37.323]  And we're in an info war.
[02:29:37.323 --> 02:29:39.484]  We got way more than 5%, brother.
[02:29:39.484 --> 02:29:41.544]  So, spectators really don't count.
[02:29:41.544 --> 02:29:43.525]  They've already taken themselves out of the game.
[02:29:43.525 --> 02:29:49.688]  What matters is that you're out there spreading the word, getting involved, and the system can't stop that.
[02:29:49.688 --> 02:29:51.509]  No army can stop an idea whose time's come.
[02:29:51.509 --> 02:29:52.769]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.769 --> 02:29:55.290]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.290 --> 02:29:57.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.482 --> 02:30:08.126]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.126 --> 02:30:13.290]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.290 --> 02:30:22.016]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:22.016 --> 02:30:26.078]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:26.078 --> 02:30:28.019]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:30.490 --> 02:30:35.092]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:30:35.092 --> 02:30:38.933]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[02:30:38.933 --> 02:30:40.154]  Others don't.
[02:30:40.154 --> 02:30:42.295]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.295 --> 02:30:44.076]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:44.076 --> 02:30:46.977]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:46.977 --> 02:30:53.599]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.599 --> 02:30:56.300]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:56.300 --> 02:30:58.661]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:30:58.661 --> 02:30:59.162]  Others don't.
[02:31:00.677 --> 02:31:05.220]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.220 --> 02:31:06.140]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:09.563]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.563 --> 02:31:10.423]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.423 --> 02:31:15.326]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.326 --> 02:31:16.067]  It's true.
[02:31:16.067 --> 02:31:20.930]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.930 --> 02:31:21.770]  Number 3.
[02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:25.353]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.353 --> 02:31:29.055]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.255 --> 02:31:30.055]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.055 --> 02:31:32.796]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.796 --> 02:31:36.478]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.478 --> 02:31:37.278]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.278 --> 02:31:41.420]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:46.482]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:53.970 --> 02:32:54.430]  Thank you!
[02:33:09.618 --> 02:33:16.962]  All the leaves are brown And the sky is grey
[02:33:38.703 --> 02:33:47.105]  Okay, I want to get into the economy and what's happened with the Liberty Dollar.
[02:33:47.105 --> 02:33:55.207]  Fed six, seven million in privately made Liberty Dollars here in a moment, but first I wanted to get into some predictive programming.
[02:33:55.207 --> 02:34:03.669]  We're in video games, movies, much of it admittedly financed by the federal government, and think tanks to put out certain messages.
[02:34:03.669 --> 02:34:04.969]  Like you watch dramas.
[02:34:04.969 --> 02:34:07.390]  I mean, I might watch dramas twice a year,
[02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:16.252]  And almost every episode is the person that's against abortions wants to murder people or the homeschoolers are trying to nerve gas the neighborhood.
[02:34:16.252 --> 02:34:23.533]  Then they have federal drills all over the country where they come into unannounced elementary schools and scream, we're going to kill you.
[02:34:23.533 --> 02:34:25.813]  We're anti open border people.
[02:34:25.813 --> 02:34:27.914]  We're we're pro-life.
[02:34:27.914 --> 02:34:29.234]  We're anti.
[02:34:29.234 --> 02:34:34.175]  You know, groups that don't like the Second Amendment.
[02:34:34.983 --> 02:34:51.070]  This is all part of a demonization campaign where these groups really aren't committing any of these crimes or doing any of these things, and the globalists are using it to traumatize children in these drills, but then the only thing that backs it up in reality is the unreality of television.
[02:34:51.070 --> 02:34:55.852]  And a great example of this is almost all the cop shows are based in Chicago or New York.
[02:34:57.862 --> 02:34:58.963]  And they're dramas.
[02:34:58.963 --> 02:35:01.825]  And they catch a guy with a gun in his house, he goes to jail.
[02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:04.788]  They catch a guy with a shotgun in his car, he goes to jail.
[02:35:04.788 --> 02:35:08.170]  Not illegal in most states.
[02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:11.273]  It's only actually a few cities where it's totally illegal.
[02:35:11.273 --> 02:35:12.514]  But they don't care.
[02:35:12.514 --> 02:35:22.742]  And then people that weren't raised in the Second Amendment, who don't know their rights, they then think when they're at your house and they see a gun case locked with firearms in it, they begin hyperventilating.
[02:35:23.422 --> 02:35:34.308]  I mean, I've put my gun cases and things, you know, now in the closet, locked up, because repair people and others see it, and they begin hyperventilating, and they want to call the police, and in one case, you know, they tried to.
[02:35:34.308 --> 02:35:36.449]  I've talked about that hundreds of times.
[02:35:36.449 --> 02:35:37.949]  This is mind control.
[02:35:37.949 --> 02:35:47.934]  I got my guns, they're legal, and some domesticated, cowardly, servile person, most of the time I see it in the news, it's realtors.
[02:35:47.934 --> 02:35:50.816]  They come in your house, they see guns, they call the police.
[02:35:50.816 --> 02:35:52.797]  Reloading equipment, it's over, you're going to jail.
[02:35:53.444 --> 02:35:56.205]  And the SWAT team goes ahead and hits you and hits you hard.
[02:35:56.205 --> 02:35:56.945]  They know it's legal.
[02:35:56.945 --> 02:35:58.146]  They don't care.
[02:35:58.146 --> 02:35:59.366]  I see those reports all the time.
[02:35:59.366 --> 02:36:08.490]  It's almost always an old man in his garage who's tinkering cleaning guns and neighbors walk by and call the police and the cops take him to jail.
[02:36:08.490 --> 02:36:13.772]  I've seen this countless times and say, well, he did have nine firearms and 2,000 rounds of ammo.
[02:36:13.772 --> 02:36:14.993]  We believe this is an arsenal.
[02:36:15.913 --> 02:36:26.156]  Then you look up the state law, whether it's California where I've seen it or Massachusetts, and there's no law against having the nine firearms or the ammo, but they still go to jail.
[02:36:26.156 --> 02:36:33.698]  Remember the woman in New York got pulled over with a shotgun in her trunk, and it was legal, but they went ahead and took her to jail?
[02:36:33.698 --> 02:36:38.040]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I have seen my listeners go to jail.
[02:36:38.877 --> 02:36:40.559]  And it's in the newspaper.
[02:36:40.559 --> 02:36:43.081]  Kelly Rushing, this has got to be seven, eight years ago.
[02:36:43.081 --> 02:36:47.365]  And I read the Kentucky, uh, Lyon County newspaper, showed it to you here on air.
[02:36:47.365 --> 02:36:48.506]  He calls me.
[02:36:48.506 --> 02:36:50.068]  I'd heard the caller before.
[02:36:50.068 --> 02:36:53.491]  He was handing out hundreds of my videos, at that time VHS.
[02:36:53.491 --> 02:36:57.835]  And on one VHS, it had a Ron Paul, neocon speech for an hour.
[02:36:57.835 --> 02:37:00.057]  And then it had road to tyranny.
[02:37:00.057 --> 02:37:00.658]  In slow play.
[02:37:01.658 --> 02:37:06.825]  And he was giving it out around town, family very well known, middle class guy, business owner.
[02:37:06.825 --> 02:37:09.148]  Because when I first heard the story, I made phone calls to the town.
[02:37:09.148 --> 02:37:10.049]  I didn't believe it.
[02:37:10.049 --> 02:37:12.973]  I was naive seven, eight years ago.
[02:37:12.973 --> 02:37:18.379]  And I looked in the phone book, called other rushings.
[02:37:19.821 --> 02:37:20.182]  I think?
[02:37:37.895 --> 02:37:43.436]  All it shows was military admitting they're trying to take our guns and Ron Paul giving a speech in the House of Representatives.
[02:37:43.436 --> 02:37:53.839]  And the state police came and arrested him and they took it to trial and told the jury, put him in jail for three years per count for the Ron Paul video he was charged and for my video.
[02:37:53.839 --> 02:37:56.300]  Both were seen as illegal.
[02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:01.281]  And I called the judge up at home and I said, are you really doing this?
[02:38:01.281 --> 02:38:03.262]  You're really having a trial for a video?
[02:38:03.262 --> 02:38:04.962]  And he said, yes, but I'm not gonna talk about the case with you.
[02:38:06.377 --> 02:38:07.797]  I couldn't believe that then.
[02:38:07.797 --> 02:38:08.898]  Then I saw other cases.
[02:38:08.898 --> 02:38:12.558]  So, in America, they will arrest you for your illegal firearms.
[02:38:12.558 --> 02:38:15.939]  They will arrest you for not vaccinating your children, even though it's not the law.
[02:38:15.939 --> 02:38:17.379]  You see it all the time in the news.
[02:38:17.379 --> 02:38:22.861]  They will arrest you for things that are legal and lawful because they love it.
[02:38:22.861 --> 02:38:25.461]  The government is scum, criminal, run.
[02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:30.422]  Now, you want to ship hundreds of billions of narcotics in and have Wells Fargo, Wachovia caught with it?
[02:38:30.422 --> 02:38:31.623]  You don't get in trouble.
[02:38:31.623 --> 02:38:33.223]  Bloomberg, London Telegraph.
[02:38:34.158 --> 02:38:36.318]  Was it back in the news yesterday?
[02:38:36.318 --> 02:38:44.440]  You want to be Dyncor Halliburton caught runnin' giant child kidnapping rings all over the world, congressional hearings, nobody gets in trouble.
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:50.181]  You want to put sodium fluoride in the water, causing massive cancer increases knowingly, you don't get in trouble.
[02:38:50.181 --> 02:38:57.522]  You're the UN caught adding sterilants to vaccines worldwide on record, you don't get in trouble.
[02:38:57.522 --> 02:39:02.203]  But, you spank your kid in the backyard when they try to climb the fence or whatever,
[02:39:03.928 --> 02:39:05.849]  And it isn't even illegal.
[02:39:05.849 --> 02:39:09.430]  Your neighbor calls, you're going to lose your kids if they have their way.
[02:39:09.430 --> 02:39:16.113]  You clean your gun in the garage with it open, those yuppies are going to see you go to jail and they're going to feel good when you're in the back of that squad car.
[02:39:16.113 --> 02:39:21.475]  And the government so loves tattletailing that they will try to still put you in jail even if it's not illegal.
[02:39:21.475 --> 02:39:23.456]  This is what America's become.
[02:39:23.456 --> 02:39:25.897]  Alright, now I've segued and digressed off into other areas.
[02:39:25.897 --> 02:39:29.318]  I want to go to Rob, Alan, Sean, Gator, Scott and others.
[02:39:31.872 --> 02:39:42.057]  But let's go ahead and play this new video game trailer, and I see these all the time, for America 2049 has kicked off a viral marketing campaign to promote what appears to be an upcoming video game.
[02:39:42.057 --> 02:39:52.763]  The story sounds and surrounds an America in 2049 ruled by a tyrannical group known as the Council of American Heritage and fighting the freedom group called the Terrorist Organization.
[02:39:54.124 --> 02:39:56.649]  You won't have to wait to 2049 for this to happen.
[02:39:56.649 --> 02:39:59.354]  Try 2020 if we don't slow things down or even faster.
[02:39:59.354 --> 02:40:02.541]  They're openly everywhere trying to push restrictions on free speech.
[02:40:02.541 --> 02:40:03.443]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:40:06.716 --> 02:40:11.718]  They told me that I belong to anybody who wants me from now on.
[02:40:11.718 --> 02:40:14.419]  I wanted the chance to be free!
[02:40:14.419 --> 02:40:17.340]  To reclaim my heritage!
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:22.383]  See around here, they don't allow any mixing of the races like they do in looser parts of the country.
[02:40:22.383 --> 02:40:26.664]  A secure government facility has been attacked.
[02:40:26.664 --> 02:40:29.786]  Sources tell us that at least five inmates have been freed.
[02:40:29.786 --> 02:40:35.428]  Preliminary reports allege that the attackers are affiliated with Divided We Fall, the terrorist group.
[02:40:35.928 --> 02:40:37.990]  Agent, so nice to see you again.
[02:40:37.990 --> 02:40:40.032]  You're becoming great friends.
[02:40:40.032 --> 02:40:42.234]  Eyes will be watching you.
[02:40:42.234 --> 02:40:43.715]  And judging you.
[02:40:43.715 --> 02:40:47.639]  If we find him, we can take out DWF from the top.
[02:40:47.639 --> 02:40:49.701]  It's of vital importance.
[02:40:49.701 --> 02:40:52.143]  Don't let us down again, Agent.
[02:40:52.143 --> 02:40:59.509]  Guys like us took an oath to protect this country against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
[02:40:59.509 --> 02:41:00.971]  That oath didn't die with our army.
[02:41:05.962 --> 02:41:08.564]  Okay, so there you have it.
[02:41:08.564 --> 02:41:12.287]  This is supposedly some right-wing government's taking over in the future.
[02:41:12.287 --> 02:41:19.013]  Now, here is another video game ad that's been out for a couple years.
[02:41:19.013 --> 02:41:20.214]  Shattered Union.
[02:41:20.214 --> 02:41:27.500]  And notice the United Nations basically invades to save America, and they're one of the factions.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:30.343]  But the evil Texans, they're one of the big enemies here.
[02:41:30.343 --> 02:41:31.404]  Here it is, Shattered Union.
[02:41:33.427 --> 02:41:36.929]  Following a disputed election and a tie vote, the U.S.
[02:41:36.929 --> 02:41:40.011]  Congress installs the most unpopular president in U.S.
[02:41:40.011 --> 02:41:45.854]  history as David Jefferson Adams becomes the 44th President of the United States.
[02:41:45.854 --> 02:41:53.719]  Shortly after the election, increased unrest, rioting, and a growing number of militias have given rise to ever-increasing domestic terrorism.
[02:41:55.703 --> 02:42:03.408]  In response, the President invokes the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on the West Coast and other areas of the country.
[02:42:03.408 --> 02:42:12.775]  Though highly contested, a Supreme Court ruling sidesteps the electoral process, disqualifying popular presidential candidates from several states.
[02:42:12.775 --> 02:42:19.700]  Public outrage explodes when a sham election leads to incumbent David Adams accepting a second term in office.
[02:42:21.912 --> 02:42:25.874]  During the 57th Inauguration Day Ceremonies, Washington D.C.
[02:42:25.874 --> 02:42:31.356]  is struck by a low-yield nuclear weapon, killing David Adams and most of the U.S.
[02:42:31.356 --> 02:42:33.877]  Congress.
[02:42:33.877 --> 02:42:36.338]  The destruction of Washington D.C.
[02:42:36.338 --> 02:42:40.940]  effectively breaks the chain of succession, sending the nation into chaos.
[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:46.223]  In an emergency vote, the European Union deploys peacekeepers in the greater D.C.
[02:42:46.223 --> 02:42:48.664]  area to secure international interest.
[02:42:50.103 --> 02:42:58.329]  With separatist sentiment rising, California's governor declares home rule and secedes from the union.
[02:42:58.329 --> 02:43:07.376]  Texas follows quickly and declares sovereignty, taking neighboring states with them and forming the Republic of Texas.
[02:43:07.376 --> 02:43:13.480]  Now, the once United States of America lie in ruin.
[02:43:15.687 --> 02:43:15.888]  Okay.
[02:43:15.888 --> 02:43:23.375]  Now, going back here, you notice the United Nations invades countries all over the world and always engages in massacres.
[02:43:35.293 --> 02:43:47.741]  And you notice that deals have been signed under the Security and Prosperity Partnership, North American Union Security Perimeter, to quote, use foreign troops in North America to put down civil insurrection.
[02:43:47.741 --> 02:43:50.463]  That's now Ottawa Citizen, Associated Press.
[02:43:50.463 --> 02:43:56.647]  They signed the deal almost nine years ago, but they've made it public now this year.
[02:43:56.647 --> 02:44:02.831]  We even have a few mainstream news articles reporting on it from 2002 that are in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[02:44:02.831 --> 02:44:04.572]  9-1-1, the Road to Tyranny.
[02:44:06.465 --> 02:44:17.749]  So basically, the public is being acclimated to accept foreign troops here inside of the United States during civil insurrection.
[02:44:17.749 --> 02:44:22.391]  And NLE09, run by FEMA, had that in their battle plan as well.
[02:44:22.391 --> 02:44:26.172]  So, everybody's just being conditioned to accept this, and I tell you now what's in the cards.
[02:44:26.832 --> 02:44:34.976]  And you see the precedent set of UN forces and NATO forces bombing and going into countries when their rebels are overthrowing the government.
[02:44:34.976 --> 02:44:38.538]  Going on in the Ivory Coast right now, going on in Libya.
[02:44:38.538 --> 02:44:45.442]  And what's happening now in the Ivory Coast really signifies this is what we broke down a month ago, what other experts broke down.
[02:44:45.442 --> 02:44:52.186]  It appears to be an AFRICOM system run out of the Pentagon with NATO as its front.
[02:44:54.272 --> 02:44:56.453]  All right, continuing with the news here.
[02:44:56.453 --> 02:45:02.277]  Gold rises near 1,435 as dollar retreats, oil climbs.
[02:45:02.277 --> 02:45:04.819]  In fact, guys, will you get me the latest on gold prices?
[02:45:04.819 --> 02:45:06.460]  Let me just pull up Kitco if you want.
[02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:08.401]  I want to get the latest on gold and silver prices.
[02:45:08.401 --> 02:45:09.762]  Thank you.
[02:45:09.762 --> 02:45:21.410]  Gold rose back to above 1,430 an ounce today as oil prices climbed and the dollar eased and traders anticipated a rate hike from the European Central Bank that may lead to further weakness in the U.S.
[02:45:21.410 --> 02:45:21.810]  currency.
[02:45:23.507 --> 02:45:29.688]  And of course, they're not gonna follow suit, they said, until the end of the year with rate hikes.
[02:45:29.688 --> 02:45:32.249]  And so that will further weaken the dollar.
[02:45:32.249 --> 02:45:35.249]  Spot gold was around 1,434 an ounce against 1,427 late on Friday.
[02:45:35.249 --> 02:45:38.410]  And as of this morning, silver was up yet again as well.
[02:45:38.410 --> 02:45:39.450]  So the issue here is every time
[02:45:53.632 --> 02:46:01.678]  That gold goes up and silver goes up, the system comes in and tries to push it back down.
[02:46:01.678 --> 02:46:08.164]  But if you look at the one-year graph, the five-year graph, the 10-year, the 11-year graph, both gold and silver are going up.
[02:46:08.164 --> 02:46:15.610]  But whenever it dips down before it goes back up, they always hype that it's been completely discredited and destroyed.
[02:46:15.610 --> 02:46:18.392]  And so yuppies and people run around saying, see, it's a bad investment.
[02:46:19.209 --> 02:46:20.050]  That's like a beach ball.
[02:46:20.050 --> 02:46:22.392]  They push it under, it pops back up.
[02:46:22.392 --> 02:46:24.754]  But more news on inflation increasing.
[02:46:24.754 --> 02:46:28.898]  The head of Walmart obviously last week saying we're facing serious inflation.
[02:46:28.898 --> 02:46:39.207]  But the White House is still running around saying that their monetization of trillions of debt is not causing a problem, even though historically and monetarily we know what this is going to do.
[02:46:39.207 --> 02:46:41.469]  Continuing along the monetary policy line,
[02:46:42.881 --> 02:46:54.152]  To say that there's been a thousand companies as conservative, I haven't counted it up, but there are thousands of known companies that have come and gone that issue gold and silver coins, commemorative coins.
[02:46:54.152 --> 02:47:02.660]  I could go start a company, you could start a company, and stamp out coins as commemorative and put them out.
[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:04.282]  Now, going back more than 15 years ago,
[02:47:06.218 --> 02:47:11.805]  The Liberty Dollar came out with the guy that had run the famous Hawaiian private mint that put out commemorative coins.
[02:47:11.805 --> 02:47:15.128]  I remember seeing when I was a kid the ads on TV for his outfit.
[02:47:15.128 --> 02:47:17.171]  Well, he decided to put out an alternative currency.
[02:47:18.015 --> 02:47:26.622]  Which any city, county, individual, you can have a business and say, you know, we use this currency here, cash in cash, to get it.
[02:47:26.622 --> 02:47:27.763]  A lot of places do.
[02:47:27.763 --> 02:47:39.091]  Like I said, when you go to a Dave & Buster's or some type of place where you eat dinner and play video games and things, you can take your money, give them cash or credit card, and they put it on the Dave & Buster's card.
[02:47:39.091 --> 02:47:40.953]  And then that has the money on it.
[02:47:40.953 --> 02:47:43.275]  And what the feds are saying here is that's illegal.
[02:47:45.023 --> 02:47:52.188]  And you got Montana, you got South Carolina moving to pass legislation to issue their own state gold and silver currency.
[02:47:52.188 --> 02:47:55.010]  And in our country's history, many states have had their own currencies.
[02:47:55.010 --> 02:47:57.512]  In fact, we had a lot of competing currencies until 1913.
[02:47:57.512 --> 02:47:59.574]  You still had the overall Lincoln-Greenback.
[02:48:01.068 --> 02:48:01.508]  I think?
[02:48:16.564 --> 02:48:21.349]  Federal prosecutors on Monday tried to take a hoard of silver.
[02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:23.531]  Liberty dollars worth about 7 million.
[02:48:23.531 --> 02:48:28.255]  Now, they also had paper that people could put on deposit at Liberty Dollar.
[02:48:28.255 --> 02:48:32.519]  When the feds first raided them, they had enough silver and more for all the paper they'd also issue.
[02:48:33.407 --> 02:48:37.570]  They thought they'd get them there, but the feds convict people over 96% of the time.
[02:48:37.570 --> 02:48:40.332]  They don't like to be wrong, so they just make stuff up as they go along.
[02:48:40.332 --> 02:48:45.935]  Kind of like taking you to jail for legal guns, or for illegal AR-15.
[02:48:45.935 --> 02:48:55.302]  Federal prosecutors on Monday tried to take a hoard of silver, liberty dollars worth $7 million that authorities say was invented by an Indiana man to compete with US currency.
[02:48:55.302 --> 02:48:57.103]  He invented silver and gold coins!
[02:48:59.670 --> 02:49:14.770]  Bernard von Nathas, 67, we need to get him on, was convicted last month in federal court in Statesville on conspiracy and counterfeiting charges for making and selling the currency which he promoted as inflation-proof competition for the U.S.
[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:15.090]  dollar.
[02:49:16.468 --> 02:49:22.913]  That's what we promote to buy gold and silver, whether it be Australian, or whether it be British, or Canadian, or U.S.
[02:49:22.913 --> 02:49:40.247]  government, buffaloes, or eagles, or South African Krugerrands, or Swiss francs, or British sovereigns, because, I mean, you know, 10 years ago you buy it at 260 bucks an ounce, and now it's 1,430 something.
[02:49:40.247 --> 02:49:42.188]  That's about the inflation line.
[02:49:42.188 --> 02:49:44.750]  That's why you get this commodity that's been used for 6,000 years.
[02:49:46.630 --> 02:49:48.393]  It's not rocket science.
[02:49:48.393 --> 02:49:50.817]  And so, oh, he promoted it as inflation-proof.
[02:49:50.817 --> 02:49:53.802]  See, they sell this like it's dirty.
[02:49:53.802 --> 02:49:56.186]  Like, these people don't give their kids vaccines.
[02:49:56.186 --> 02:49:58.029]  These people eat organic food.
[02:49:58.029 --> 02:50:01.094]  How many vegetarian families or organic families have their kids taken?
[02:50:02.284 --> 02:50:03.445]  A lot.
[02:50:03.445 --> 02:50:08.592]  The prosecutor successfully painted Vister von Nuthaus in a false light and now the U.S.
[02:50:08.592 --> 02:50:19.265]  attorney responsible for the prosecution is painting the case in a false light saying that it establishes that private voluntary barter currency is illegal, his lawyer wrote.
[02:50:20.336 --> 02:50:23.358]  The trial was scheduled to resume Monday in Statesville.
[02:50:23.358 --> 02:50:31.582]  The case involves more than five tons of Liberty Dollars and precious metals seized from a warehouse, it was in a vault, which the government wants to take by forfeiture.
[02:50:31.582 --> 02:50:33.463]  They want to steal it.
[02:50:33.463 --> 02:50:41.868]  Kind of like when the government caught $376 billion in laundered money and the big banks owning the planes and everything.
[02:50:41.868 --> 02:50:43.809]  They just said, just give us $100 million.
[02:50:43.809 --> 02:50:45.910]  We just want a little piece.
[02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:46.551]  Hey, we understand.
[02:50:46.551 --> 02:50:47.791]  We ship it in with you.
[02:50:47.791 --> 02:50:48.432]  It's competition.
[02:50:49.974 --> 02:50:51.496]  So there you go.
[02:50:51.496 --> 02:50:59.104]  Legal aliens can run wild, drunk, drive to wherever they want, corrupt government, foreign banks can steal trillions, but you don't issue your own silver and gold coins.
[02:50:59.104 --> 02:51:00.025]  How dare you!
[02:51:01.101 --> 02:51:02.922]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.922 --> 02:51:18.468]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:51:18.468 --> 02:51:18.809]  dollar.
[02:51:18.809 --> 02:51:24.251]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide
[02:51:24.491 --> 02:51:28.514]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[02:51:28.514 --> 02:51:29.715]  economy and inflation.
[02:51:29.715 --> 02:51:39.824]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[02:51:39.824 --> 02:51:45.268]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:51:46.209 --> 02:51:55.694]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.

[02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:03.850]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[02:52:03.850 --> 02:52:04.530]  No kidding!

[02:54:12.779 --> 02:54:17.643]  By the way, continuing with economic news, Wall Street Journal, Precious Metals.
[02:54:17.643 --> 02:54:20.566]  Inflation worries send gold, silver higher.
[02:54:20.566 --> 02:54:25.130]  Silver is at $38 and change, getting up there at an all-time high.
[02:54:25.130 --> 02:54:31.995]  Gold futures rose even above the point that they physically went today, signaling higher silver and gold in the days to come.
[02:54:31.995 --> 02:54:35.018]  Another headline, gold, silver rises, inflation projection.
[02:54:35.018 --> 02:54:38.041]  The Street, Market Watch, gold, silver futures trade higher.
[02:54:39.454 --> 02:54:42.135]  And of course, housing prices continue to plunge.
[02:54:42.135 --> 02:54:49.097]  But the media, the dominant talking heads, tell us that the economy's a lot better and inflation is no big deal.
[02:54:49.097 --> 02:54:50.497]  I had to bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:54:50.497 --> 02:54:52.118]  I just called him during the break.
[02:54:52.118 --> 02:54:58.880]  Because Ted is still, as of this morning, he said, I'm about to go up $31 for three silver dollars.
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:01.160]  Three silver dollars at $38 a piece.
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:02.301]  Do the math.
[02:55:02.301 --> 02:55:02.681]  What is that?
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:11.084]  How much is three silver dollars right now in the regular market, Ted?
[02:55:11.752 --> 02:55:16.033]  Well, the regular silver dollars are over $40 a piece.
[02:55:16.033 --> 02:55:25.915]  So, if you're picking up three of your videos and three of the silver dollars, and we're delivering them for $110, I mean, it is so far beyond being a no-brainer, Alex.
[02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:34.256]  I mean, again, like you and I discussed last time, I have to raise my prices because I'm selling these things for less than what I pay for them now by a great margin.
[02:55:34.256 --> 02:55:38.677]  Yeah, three of those coins is $120 if you're lucky, but you're talking about
[02:55:40.577 --> 02:55:42.298]  Uh, how much for the three coins, Ted?
[02:55:42.298 --> 02:55:47.001]  Well, it's $110 delivered, $5 goes for the postage, and there's some value there.
[02:55:47.001 --> 02:55:48.922]  Well, $15 at least.
[02:55:48.922 --> 02:55:54.605]  But then on top of it, fall the Republic, Obama deception, and endgame, a $60 value.
[02:55:54.605 --> 02:55:58.347]  So we're talking about a $70-plus discount.
[02:55:58.347 --> 02:56:03.809]  It's a smoking deal on silver alone at $31 an ounce, with it over $38 right now.
[02:56:03.809 --> 02:56:04.390]  Do the math.
[02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:07.050]  I would say that your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:56:07.050 --> 02:56:08.071]  Quite frankly, it doesn't.
[02:56:08.071 --> 02:56:09.731]  Ted does these loss leaders.
[02:56:09.731 --> 02:56:13.012]  I love to be able to offer things to our listeners.
[02:56:13.012 --> 02:56:16.052]  How long, Ted, can you hold it at the $31 a piece?
[02:56:16.052 --> 02:56:18.453]  You know, Alex, I'm going to hold this until tonight.
[02:56:18.453 --> 02:56:26.775]  I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow because gold, I'm sorry, silver's at $38.63 at market peak today, and I'm expecting it to go even further.
[02:56:26.775 --> 02:56:32.636]  When I have silver spots sitting at $39 an ounce, I'm not going to be able to sell silver dollars at this price.
[02:56:32.636 --> 02:56:33.816]  It's just impossible.
[02:56:33.916 --> 02:56:38.099]  Yeah, the point is you're not like other brokers that get the orders and then try to buy it.
[02:56:38.099 --> 02:56:40.401]  You have it in your vault there in town at the bank.
[02:56:40.401 --> 02:56:42.582]  You take it and then ship it out to people.
[02:56:42.582 --> 02:56:43.443]  You've got it right now.
[02:56:43.443 --> 02:56:51.609]  You've also got limited silver and other gold coins, but they've got to say it's the radio special to have that long list of super discounts.
[02:56:51.609 --> 02:56:52.910]  What are some of the other specials?
[02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:54.191]  Briefly, you've got Ted Anderson.
[02:56:54.491 --> 02:56:58.074]  Well, I mean, right now the Walking Liberty half right now is at $1,808.
[02:56:58.074 --> 02:57:00.296]  Those are over $20 now regularly.
[02:57:00.296 --> 02:57:03.198]  The Lakota Nation coin's at $44.65.
[02:57:03.198 --> 02:57:04.639]  That's gone up too.
[02:57:04.639 --> 02:57:05.900]  British Sovereign's right now at $390.
[02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:07.961]  Those are higher.
[02:57:07.961 --> 02:57:09.463]  Frank's right now at $311.
[02:57:09.463 --> 02:57:12.385]  We've got a range of things.
[02:57:12.385 --> 02:57:13.165]  Hey, how about this?
[02:57:13.165 --> 02:57:18.910]  The Creature from Jekyll Island book delivered right now for $31 and get one silver dollar in it.
[02:57:18.910 --> 02:57:23.173]  I mean, it's just, there's such an array of things that I have that are so far below stock.
[02:57:23.173 --> 02:57:23.633]  Let's explain.
[02:57:24.574 --> 02:57:24.734]  Yeah.
[02:57:42.156 --> 02:57:48.818]  Ted is crazy, there's no doubt about it, crazy for liberty, and a very competitive individual, but it ends tonight at these prices.
[02:57:48.818 --> 02:57:50.959]  It'll go up a little, but still be a great deal.
[02:57:50.959 --> 02:57:54.260]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you, though, or it'll be the higher price, which is still a great deal.
[02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:54.320]  800-686-2237.
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:54.780]  800-686-2237.
[02:57:54.780 --> 02:57:59.261]  Silver and gold right now exploding because of dollar devaluation, as they now talk about QE3.
[02:58:08.664 --> 02:58:14.007]  And further global devaluation 800-686-2237.
[02:58:14.007 --> 02:58:19.250]  Again, they tell them it's the Radio Alex Jones Special to get a whole list of things that are discounted, right Ted?
[02:58:19.250 --> 02:58:20.811]  Yep, that's right.
[02:58:20.811 --> 02:58:26.274]  And chief among it, three silver dollars, three of my films, for what, you said 110?
[02:58:26.274 --> 02:58:26.494]  110 delivered.
[02:58:29.035 --> 02:58:32.617]  So that's the shipping on top of it for free.
[02:58:32.617 --> 02:58:33.137]  Do the math.
[02:58:33.137 --> 02:58:35.299]  It doesn't, again, I mean, can you find something better?
[02:58:35.299 --> 02:58:36.439]  I dare you.
[02:58:36.439 --> 02:58:37.160]  800-686-237.
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:40.942]  The Jesse Ventura interview coming up in retransmission and fullwars.com.
[02:58:40.942 --> 02:58:42.963]  Great job, Greg.
[02:58:42.963 --> 02:58:44.203]  Jesse Ventura coming up.
[02:58:44.203 --> 02:58:45.524]  Incredible interview.
[02:58:45.524 --> 02:58:47.045]  See you back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[02:58:47.045 --> 02:58:47.665]  Love you all.
[02:58:47.665 --> 02:58:49.266]  We're going to beat the globalists together.
[02:58:49.266 --> 02:58:50.547]  The truth's unstoppable!
[02:58:52.515 --> 02:58:56.519]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.519 --> 02:58:59.763]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.763 --> 02:59:04.928]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.928 --> 02:59:10.954]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.954 --> 02:59:13.197]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.737 --> 02:59:14.037]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.037 --> 02:59:14.558]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.558 --> 02:59:15.338]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.338 --> 02:59:16.499]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.499 --> 02:59:18.741]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.631 --> 02:59:34.752]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.752 --> 02:59:39.915]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.915 --> 02:59:52.081]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
