[00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:09.837]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:11.418]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:12.959]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.162]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:21.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.926]  We are live.
[00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:40.768]  It is Tuesday, the 23rd day of August 2011.
[00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:45.170]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:58.056]  Paul Joseph Watson has detailed reports on the latest Libya hoax that all of Qaddafi's sons have been captured and that Qaddafi would be captured within hours.
[00:00:58.056 --> 00:00:59.876]  They were saying that last night.
[00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:00.577]  The truth is
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:19.473]  A bunch of Al Qaeda forces led by US and NATO commanders landed now two and a half days ago off the coast in a nighttime landing and engage in a special forces destabilization disinformation operation.
[00:01:19.473 --> 00:01:25.317]  Basically blowing up buildings, setting fires, a classic operation.
[00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:28.099]  You see it fictionalized in something like Red Dawn
[00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:44.043]  Where disguised jumbo jets come in and the nose cones pop off and special forces troops come out and seize control of the police stations and take control of the surrounding area.
[00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:50.650]  That only works in places where the population is disarmed or psychologically is weak and will lay down.
[00:01:54.105 --> 00:02:00.310]  And the fact that the American people aren't more upset over the fact that we're, quote, teamed up with Al-Qaeda, who knows?
[00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.775]  They could have, I guess, Al-Qaeda come here and the American people would probably bow down to them if the government told them that they should.
[00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:10.674]  That's pretty amazing.
[00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:12.114]  We got Paul Watson joining us.
[00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:15.576]  We got Webster Tarpley popping back in.
[00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:19.858]  Tarpley was saying, hey, this looks like a disinformation operation yesterday.
[00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:22.719]  And I was partially rolling my eyes.
[00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.281]  I mean, I know there was this battle still going on for Tripoli.
[00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:32.323]  But now we've really got a clear image of what's going on here.
[00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:33.904]  And I'll be covering that after the break.
[00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:38.466]  But the long and short of it is they need a beachhead inside Tripoli.
[00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:46.781]  As a pretext to now recognize it as the official government of Libya and then have the official government.
[00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:51.644]  The Al Qaeda operatives put out the S.O.S.
[00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:55.507]  and request foreign troops to occupy.
[00:02:55.507 --> 00:03:02.873]  That way they play this psychological game of, oh, if the foreign troops aren't occupying, we're asking you to come in.
[00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:08.058]  Oh, the United States was going to leave in 2004 and 2005 and 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 and 11, but every year the Iraqi puppet government says no.
[00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:14.643]  Stay longer.
[00:03:14.643 --> 00:03:16.765]  So see, we're not occupying.
[00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:21.189]  The puppet government says, oh, please stay.
[00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:35.922]  And so the Al Qaeda government, sniping men, women, and children, blowing up buildings, can now be given the government of Libya's seized assets and are calling for British Special Forces troops and other NATO troops, along with U.S.
[00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:39.586]  troops, to openly come into the city and finish off Qaddafi.
[00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:42.492]  And so that's where this is headed.
[00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:58.357]  Now, if the rebels can get it done, the establishment wants that because they know there's a good chance that once the Western troops are openly running around, which has already been happening, that it's going to have a lot of Libyans go ahead and decide to stand up for their country.
[00:03:58.357 --> 00:04:09.921]  Even if they're not fans of a person that looks like a microwaved wax figurine, but looks aren't really what matters at the end of the day, Muammar Gaddafi.
[00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.488]  So we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:18.091]  But I heard John McCain this morning on the radio saying, look, it's over.
[00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:18.691]  It's done.
[00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:24.214]  This is public relations to say that there's a counterattack happening.
[00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:26.335]  Well, the counterattack is admitted.
[00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:29.897]  It's admitted that the rebels are being routed in many areas of the city.
[00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:38.942]  But there's special forces, Western special forces led attack teams trying to take over the Qaddafi compound.
[00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.170]  Because that's where the gold's at.
[00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.372]  I mean, they at least want to get their hands on those goodies, wherever Gaddafi may be.
[00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.093]  So it is off the charts crazy.
[00:04:49.093 --> 00:04:52.033]  We've got the economic news coming up as well.
[00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:52.874]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:54.434]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:55.554]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.554 --> 00:04:56.895]  This is InfoWars.com.
[00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:03.947]  Hi folks, Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.

[00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:05.478]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:08.742]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:13.547]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:19.934]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:19.934 --> 00:06:22.177]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.697 --> 00:06:22.997]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:22.997 --> 00:06:23.497]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.497 --> 00:06:23.878]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:23.878 --> 00:06:24.838]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:26.959]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:48.873]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:34.786]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:07:34.786 --> 00:07:40.009]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:08:11.605 --> 00:08:13.145]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:17.347]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:21.429]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:36.837]  It is Tuesday, the 23rd day of August, 2011.
[00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:42.662]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us via video Skype from England.
[00:08:42.662 --> 00:08:51.230]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, who's recently been to Tripoli and been under bombardment, is going to be popping in to give us his latest analysis on what's happening in Libya.
[00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.710]  And we have a...
[00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:58.536]  Maiden voyage here of a political researcher who I've listened to and read over the years.
[00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:06.943]  Harley Schlanger will be joining us coming up in the second hour to talk about world events and the economy.
[00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:12.228]  And of course we'll have open phones throughout the entire third hour today.
[00:09:13.991 --> 00:09:17.133]  Coming up, I'm going to get into the big economic developments.
[00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:22.856]  Also, news that Strauss-Kahn's New York sexual assault case has been dismissed.
[00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:24.497]  All a setup.
[00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:28.180]  All a siam.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.681]  Also, new home sales fall.
[00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:32.062]  2011 could be worst year yet.
[00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:33.363]  I thought we were in a great recovery.
[00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:45.553]  By the way, I keep getting emails going, Alex, it was $17 trillion given to the foreign banks, along with the new $1.5 trillion we're learning that was secretly given to offshore banks.
[00:09:45.553 --> 00:09:45.893]  I know.
[00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:52.295]  This is an additional trillion-plus we just discovered that Bloomberg reported on yesterday.
[00:09:52.295 --> 00:10:03.458]  If you put all the numbers together, the number I got as of a year ago, and they haven't released new numbers, is $28 trillion given to offshore banks and domestic media.
[00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:04.878]  It's a total buy-off.
[00:10:05.603 --> 00:10:07.504]  A total payoff.
[00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:16.390]  Some of them direct cash payments, others zero or less percent loans to banking institutions that then turn around and loan the money out.
[00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.131]  Ten to one.
[00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:20.713]  For every dollar they have, they can loan out ten and get interest on that.
[00:10:20.713 --> 00:10:23.355]  It's literally making money out of nothing.
[00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:27.098]  So we're going to be going over all of that as well today.
[00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:35.487]  Now, that said, I want to just briefly break down what happened in Libya.
[00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:42.270]  I'll give you the latest big developments, the latest hoax that's been exposed.
[00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:58.616]  Muammar Gaddafi, 40 years ago, staged a coup against a British government-backed puppet dictator that operated as a royal house, a monarchy.
[00:10:59.929 --> 00:11:06.955]  Before that, the fascists had been in there under Mussolini, the first use of nerve gas against populations.
[00:11:06.955 --> 00:11:13.761]  The Libyans are just constantly being overrun and taken over, and they fought back each time and they're sick of it.
[00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:20.106]  And so, Gaddafi kicks out the British-installed puppet monarchy 40 years ago.
[00:11:21.773 --> 00:11:28.856]  He is a dictator, but he's a popular dictator overall and actually does give most of the oil wealth to the population.
[00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.836]  The population explodes.
[00:11:30.836 --> 00:11:36.498]  Cities rise out of the desert.
[00:11:36.498 --> 00:11:41.080]  Qaddafi gets framed a lot for terrorism that Iran carries out.
[00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:53.737]  Qaddafi, clearly not a good guy at the end of the day, but compared to the globalist, he is not in line with their overall world program.
[00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:57.640]  Seven years ago, he signs deals with Europe and the U.S.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:04.343]  to let the big banks and big insurance companies and oil companies come in again and privatize things.
[00:12:04.343 --> 00:12:08.226]  He starts handing the economy over to the bankers.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.582]  Because he knew that they were ready to militarily come in and take him out.
[00:12:13.582 --> 00:12:16.403]  They tried to assassinate him a bunch, using Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.644]  That came out in the BBC.
[00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:21.425]  So he said, okay, I'll just give you most of the country.
[00:12:21.425 --> 00:12:24.026]  Just let us keep some of the oil revenue for the population.
[00:12:24.026 --> 00:12:26.127]  And they said no.
[00:12:26.127 --> 00:12:35.512]  First they let him think that he'd made a deal, and seven years later, they launched Al-Qaeda operations out of the east, admitted Al-Qaeda,
[00:12:36.678 --> 00:12:38.620]  I have the L.A.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.642]  Times here admitting it.
[00:12:40.642 --> 00:12:48.810]  The rebel leader admittedly brags that he helped kill Americans in Iraq and says, I still hate Americans.
[00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:59.860]  And so you've got to decide, are you for national sovereignty and Qaddafi or are you for Al Qaeda and NATO and the big megabanks, the same megabanks looting America?
[00:13:00.595 --> 00:13:08.240]  The same megabanks that threatened Congress three years ago with martial law if they wouldn't give them untold trillions.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.322]  The same megabanks that threatened just a month ago.
[00:13:11.322 --> 00:13:17.126]  Ireland and of course Greece with quote martial law tanks in the streets.
[00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:24.811]  I mean they told the parliament in Greece they said you will do this or the president is just going to do it there's going to be tanks in the streets.
[00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:28.134]  I mean that was in Reuters.
[00:13:29.332 --> 00:13:33.533]  The bankers say there'll be tanks in the streets.
[00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:34.353]  And how would they do that?
[00:13:34.353 --> 00:13:40.014]  They'll just blow up a government building, say protesters did it, roll tanks out, and start arresting people.
[00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.114]  Real simple.
[00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:44.855]  Bankers come in, blow something up, run around posing as the saviors.
[00:13:44.855 --> 00:13:50.076]  The media they own will go with the official story, with a straight face, hoax the public.
[00:13:50.076 --> 00:13:52.536]  That's how they do this.
[00:13:52.536 --> 00:13:56.097]  I mean, how do you think offshore corporations are going to take America over?
[00:13:56.097 --> 00:13:57.477]  They're going to play dirty tricks.
[00:13:58.413 --> 00:14:00.094]  It's very elementary.
[00:14:00.094 --> 00:14:01.415]  They're going to pose as your savior.
[00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:04.478]  They're going to tell you they're protecting you from terrorism.
[00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.860]  They are the ones financing the terrorists.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.721]  They are staging the terror attacks.
[00:14:08.721 --> 00:14:10.423]  They ran Al Qaeda in Serbia.
[00:14:10.423 --> 00:14:11.924]  They ran them against the Russians.
[00:14:11.924 --> 00:14:13.826]  They're running them against Gaddafi.
[00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:18.189]  They're running them against Assad of Syria.
[00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:24.214]  This is just a miscreant Muslim brigade of mercenaries.
[00:14:24.214 --> 00:14:25.095]  That's all they are.
[00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:28.656]  After the U.S.
[00:14:28.656 --> 00:14:42.567]  and NATO took over Afghanistan in 2001-2002, they flew 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda commanders out to safety into Pakistan to start the next phase of destabilization.
[00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:44.388]  They just move them around.
[00:14:44.388 --> 00:14:47.150]  They want to take over your backyard, take over your town?
[00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:53.575]  They take their Al-Qaeda chess piece and they put it in your yard.
[00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:54.616]  They want to take your house?
[00:14:54.616 --> 00:14:55.877]  The cops plant cocaine at it.
[00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.490]  They want to take your country?
[00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.051]  They plant Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:01.051]  Now, it's very simple.
[00:15:01.051 --> 00:15:05.393]  So, what's the new breaking information here?
[00:15:05.393 --> 00:15:17.977]  Paul Joseph Watson has links to the London Telegraph and other mainline reports in his boil-down article, MI6 Directed Rebel Terrorist in Tripoli Siege.
[00:15:17.977 --> 00:15:24.699]  And all that happened here is they voted in, at night, several thousand Al-Qaeda
[00:15:25.814 --> 00:15:36.082]  With MI6 commanders and they started blowing up high-rise buildings, rocket attacking police stations, attacking apartment buildings to create fear in the general public.
[00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:38.424]  Now this is a special forces tactic.
[00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:40.806]  The Russians admittedly had a plan for this.
[00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:44.990]  The United States had a plan with the NATO stay-behind networks known as Gladio.
[00:15:46.826 --> 00:16:00.735]  And what you do is you have special forces that are either inserted or deep cover operatives, and one person, a real terrorist, can go dump chlorine gas into the air conditioning system of a high-rise building, kill 10,000 people.
[00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:04.437]  And I'm not letting secrets out here, this is all well known.
[00:16:04.437 --> 00:16:09.060]  One or two operatives can burn down five or six skyscrapers with timers.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.862]  All you do is truck gasoline up into them.
[00:16:11.802 --> 00:16:20.168]  A 20-person team could have Austin looking like World War III in one hour.
[00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:20.768]  Okay?
[00:16:20.768 --> 00:16:22.189]  The Russians have these systems.
[00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:25.111]  The Chinese, admittedly, have more than 20,000.
[00:16:25.111 --> 00:16:27.773]  That's come out of a congressional report.
[00:16:27.773 --> 00:16:28.734]  Stay behind operatives.
[00:16:28.734 --> 00:16:30.575]  They're running grocery stores.
[00:16:30.575 --> 00:16:34.077]  They're working at factories.
[00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.319]  I mean, they've got saboteurs everywhere.
[00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:39.401]  And the United States and private corporations, they have saboteurs everywhere.
[00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:41.568]  Now, the U.S.
[00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:44.113]  has saboteurs inside the U.S.
[00:16:44.113 --> 00:16:47.138]  They've got 5,000 Iraqis they brought in and sheep-dipped.
[00:16:47.138 --> 00:16:48.020]  That came out in the L.A.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.461]  Times in 2003.
[00:16:54.631 --> 00:17:05.740]  Other system, InfraGard, which are over 100,000 executives who have shoot-to-kill orders of their employees if they don't follow orders during martial law.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:12.485]  And you've got all these guys on power trips with their gun in their desk and their little FBI security card.
[00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:17.169]  And a lot of these idiots, if they're told, blow up the chemical plant, they'll do it.
[00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:21.332]  I mean, folks, we are so riddled with saboteurs, it'll make your head spin.
[00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:24.406]  But side issue.
[00:17:25.714 --> 00:17:31.456]  The point is they put in reportedly a couple thousand operatives and they just started randomly blowing things up.
[00:17:31.456 --> 00:17:37.898]  Killing thousands of civilians, total bedlam, a special forces destabilization operation.
[00:17:37.898 --> 00:17:41.680]  So that Qaddafi's forces started running in every direction trying to fight them.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:50.262]  Then they made their way towards government buildings and towards the gold hoard under the Qaddafi ministerial buildings.
[00:17:50.262 --> 00:17:54.264]  They want that 144 tons of gold to give it to the rebels.
[00:17:56.474 --> 00:18:05.098]  So they can then later set up a new Al-Qaeda base and then the public will remember in two to five years that it was all staged and we'll have to go into Tripoli again.
[00:18:05.098 --> 00:18:07.800]  Again, they don't want an industrialized first world nation.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.701]  That's what this is all about.
[00:18:09.701 --> 00:18:20.366]  So they want to get the civil war going and then have NATO sit back, just controlling Tripoli and some of the key ports and oil production facilities.
[00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:21.967]  So all of that's going on.
[00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.868]  Now we've heard in the last six months
[00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:27.850]  Eight different times, I went and looked up the State Department numbers.
[00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:34.033]  Eight different times, even before four and a half months ago when NATO officially got involved.
[00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:39.876]  We've heard at least eight times that Qaddafi's been killed, or captured, or his sons have, or that he fled the country.
[00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:42.657]  And Obama said, this will last days, not weeks.
[00:18:43.988 --> 00:18:47.695]  So now four and a half months is days, not weeks, okay?
[00:18:47.695 --> 00:18:51.763]  And again, it's not a war, it's a kinetic action.
[00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:55.290]  They talk to you like you're complete and utter morons.
[00:18:56.616 --> 00:19:00.257]  They come out and tell you the Constitution is over and a bad thing.
[00:19:00.257 --> 00:19:06.018]  CNN last night was saying there's no such thing as war powers anymore.
[00:19:06.018 --> 00:19:07.578]  Congress can't get that power back.
[00:19:07.578 --> 00:19:08.978]  It now resides with the President.
[00:19:08.978 --> 00:19:11.479]  I mean, they're just stating high treason everywhere.
[00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:12.619]  This isn't a war.
[00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:14.079]  We don't need Congress.
[00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:16.420]  We don't need Congress for war or taxes.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.060]  I mean, they're just in your face.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.381]  And then they said all the sons are captured and killed, 100%.
[00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:34.227]  And then now it's come out today, here's Time Magazine, as Saif al-Islam Qaddafi turns up, free, confusion reigns in Libya.
[00:19:34.227 --> 00:19:40.273]  And it comes out that there's battles all over Tripoli with the dug-in special forces.
[00:19:40.273 --> 00:19:46.019]  Now, when I come back, I'm going to give you the key to all of this and what is about to happen.
[00:19:47.003 --> 00:19:47.364]  Okay?
[00:19:47.364 --> 00:19:52.331]  I'm going to break it down on the other side, but we've got other articles at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:52.331 --> 00:19:52.811]  Libya.
[00:19:52.811 --> 00:19:54.554]  NATO collapses.
[00:19:54.554 --> 00:19:55.756]  Qaddafi prevails again.
[00:19:55.756 --> 00:19:59.301]  NATO prefers humanitarian occupation of Libya.
[00:19:59.301 --> 00:19:59.781]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:07.303]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[00:20:07.303 --> 00:20:11.466]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:17.210]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.854]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[00:20:23.194 --> 00:20:29.760]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:37.468]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.

[00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:07.373]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan and making its way across the entire U.S.
[00:21:07.373 --> 00:21:10.396]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[00:21:10.396 --> 00:21:13.399]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:18.184]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[00:21:18.184 --> 00:21:20.386]  unless you do something to protect yourself.
[00:21:20.386 --> 00:21:20.967]  How?

[00:21:50.294 --> 00:21:51.334]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:02.858 --> 00:22:11.964]  Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.

[00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:40.084]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:49.972]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:49.972 --> 00:22:51.473]  The war is here.
[00:22:51.473 --> 00:22:53.375]  It's an info war.
[00:22:53.375 --> 00:22:55.116]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:07.202]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:23:29.486 --> 00:23:30.727]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:30.727 --> 00:23:35.290]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:41.094]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:41.094 --> 00:23:44.736]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:47.458]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:52.521]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:52.762]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.762 --> 00:23:54.163]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:01.827 --> 00:24:05.669]  Well, we're seeing the humanitarian bloodletting.
[00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:09.351]  Much of Tripoli is on fire, day and night.
[00:24:24.071 --> 00:24:32.517]  Citizens are being slaughtered and indiscriminately killed by terror squads and death squads.
[00:24:32.517 --> 00:24:43.464]  Of course, coming up when Paul Joseph Watson joins us, we have a reported audio, but who knows if it's been staged, of one of Gaddafi's sons.
[00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:48.241]  Mohammed Qaddafi being captured by rebels.
[00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:52.784]  But we've seen so much fake reportage, we don't know what's true.
[00:24:52.784 --> 00:24:58.307]  Just like we've been told that all of the sons were captured, but now we know that that's not the case.
[00:24:58.307 --> 00:25:01.049]  Libyan rebels capture Qaddafi's Tripoli compound.
[00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:11.255]  AFP is reporting right now, and it is confirmed that U.S., British, and other NATO forces are in there commanding the rebels.
[00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:14.550]  And basically leading assaults.
[00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:20.274]  So the next few months you'll hear about lots of troop transport planes that crash in the U.S.
[00:25:20.274 --> 00:25:28.519]  in Europe, and they'll just tack the numbers of dead onto that, even though their bodies will already be sitting on ice in morgues at military bases.
[00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:30.160]  And we've confirmed that a lot of U.S.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.142]  troops have already died over there.
[00:25:32.142 --> 00:25:36.825]  It's now more than 50 in the last four and a half months of the non-war.
[00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:43.670]  But again, you'll just be told later that they died in automobile accidents and plane crashes.
[00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.853]  I've talked directly to the people at the military bases.
[00:25:46.853 --> 00:25:51.257]  Now, continuing here, what's the big issue?
[00:25:51.997 --> 00:25:52.858]  Why did they do this?
[00:25:52.858 --> 00:26:00.162]  Because even if they can't fully take Tripoli, NATO, and their Al-Qaeda forces, these are admitted Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:00.162 --> 00:26:02.664]  Here's the LA Times on it.
[00:26:02.664 --> 00:26:07.166]  Libyan rebels story shows links to Taliban, Al-Qaeda, NATO.
[00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:07.807]  Oh, really?
[00:26:08.687 --> 00:26:09.589]  Wow.
[00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:16.578]  I mean, it's admitted that all the leaders of the rebel groups are Al Qaeda and being shipped in.
[00:26:16.578 --> 00:26:17.539]  By the way, it's official.
[00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:18.200]  I've got an article.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.823]  Sharia law is to be put into place there.
[00:26:20.823 --> 00:26:22.105]  Women, you're going to start wearing the...
[00:26:23.564 --> 00:26:25.626]  The Burkis.
[00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:26.927]  Same thing in Egypt.
[00:26:26.927 --> 00:26:28.668]  Same thing in Iraq.
[00:26:28.668 --> 00:26:31.870]  They put the Muslim extremists in everywhere.
[00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.372]  That's who the West wants in power.
[00:26:34.372 --> 00:26:36.113]  That's why they created Al Qaeda.
[00:26:36.113 --> 00:26:39.696]  And they can also then use that threat to take our liberties.
[00:26:39.696 --> 00:26:40.977]  It works like a charm.
[00:26:40.977 --> 00:26:41.678]  See, the globalists...
[00:26:42.761 --> 00:26:44.742]  Are attacking America and the Muslims.
[00:26:44.742 --> 00:26:47.123]  But we're thinking, oh, America's fighting Muslims.
[00:26:47.123 --> 00:26:54.346]  You've got to get into the globalist mindset of total war against all institutions and civilization and the nation-state.
[00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:56.867]  They want to wreck societies.
[00:26:56.867 --> 00:26:58.788]  So here's what's going to happen.
[00:26:58.788 --> 00:27:00.829]  Qaddafi will either be captured or killed soon.
[00:27:02.842 --> 00:27:11.328]  Or, they are going to send in U.S., British and other troops under the umbrella of NATO and the U.N.
[00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:17.372]  and the further scorched earth terror operations and slaughter meant to scare the population into submission.
[00:27:17.372 --> 00:27:26.558]  NATO admittedly is dropping these giant sonic bombs that shake the ground and just cause, you know, ear splitting noises.
[00:27:26.558 --> 00:27:30.961]  Just like at Waco, playing the sounds of dead and dying rabbits with monks chanting.
[00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:33.022]  It's psychological.
[00:27:33.022 --> 00:27:40.087]  Just so everybody's being attacked from every side, they don't know what's going on, then they announce, yes, we've got Gaddafi, we've got his sons, we've won.
[00:27:40.087 --> 00:27:44.450]  They've announced that over and over again.
[00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.013]  Then the rebels call for the foreign occupiers.
[00:27:48.013 --> 00:27:49.674]  They're the official government, we're told.
[00:27:51.602 --> 00:27:52.743]  And this can happen anywhere.
[00:27:52.743 --> 00:27:57.125]  They can have uprisings, and then the UN and the globalists recognize it.
[00:27:57.125 --> 00:28:11.652]  You're going to end up in the future having uprisings in the southwest of illegals that have been taught this is Mexico, and you're going to see our government recognize them and break off part of the southwest to be part of an autonomous UN-run enclave.
[00:28:11.652 --> 00:28:15.494]  That's on the board in the North American Union SPP plans.
[00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:19.776]  They merge the three countries, Canada, the US, and Mexico, but then break up separate
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:28.965]  Ethnic enclaves, just like in Canada, the globalists have tried to break it up with the French in the East.
[00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:31.727]  And I'm not getting in the middle of French separatists.
[00:28:31.727 --> 00:28:33.308]  At the end of the day, I could care less.
[00:28:33.308 --> 00:28:37.850]  The point is, is that that's what the globalists are up to.
[00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.731]  Now, continuing here.
[00:28:40.854 --> 00:28:46.443]  You're going to see now what we talked about in September, October, the U.S.
[00:28:46.443 --> 00:28:47.865]  forces going in.
[00:28:47.865 --> 00:28:51.111]  If Qaddafi would have fully repelled this attack, they would have still gone in.
[00:28:52.578 --> 00:28:58.381]  But now because it looks like, from what I've seen, that it's a fluid situation.
[00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:01.722]  Qaddafi has not had a very strong response to this.
[00:29:01.722 --> 00:29:03.603]  The hoax is running that he's already been defeated.
[00:29:03.603 --> 00:29:04.824]  That hasn't happened.
[00:29:04.824 --> 00:29:13.688]  But the fact that they've been able to insert these special forces, they've got Apaches in there attacking any of his troops that try to repulse the Al Qaeda heroes, according to our media.
[00:29:14.849 --> 00:29:20.716]  Uh, that, uh, they're just going to continue burning the city, uh, until everything's destroyed.
[00:29:20.716 --> 00:29:28.946]  And then that'll make the banks even happier because then they can come in and obviously loan them more fiat currency and make them debt slaves.
[00:29:28.946 --> 00:29:29.146]  So...
[00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:50.840]  That's what's happening there, but you're seeing the Nobel Peace Laureate bring absolute death and destruction, and put Al-Qaeda in, and then of course they're gonna then use Libya as a base to start attacking Europe and the United States, and that'll be used to take our freedoms.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.760]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.461]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.387 --> 00:30:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.850]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.273 --> 00:30:10.133]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.133 --> 00:30:15.016]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:15.757]  It's true.
[00:30:15.757 --> 00:30:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.460]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.043]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:28.725]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.945 --> 00:30:29.745]  Number four.
[00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:32.506]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:36.188]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:36.968]  Number five.
[00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:41.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:46.172]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.172 --> 00:30:50.353]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.353 --> 00:30:52.134]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.134 --> 00:30:56.736]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:30:57.756 --> 00:31:00.658]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:07.302]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:07.302 --> 00:31:12.445]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.445 --> 00:31:21.169]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:23.151]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:27.361]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:31:29.657 --> 00:31:34.239]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:38.080]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.321]  Others don't.
[00:31:39.321 --> 00:31:41.462]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.462 --> 00:31:43.243]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:43.243 --> 00:31:46.144]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:46.144 --> 00:31:52.766]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:31:52.766 --> 00:31:55.467]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:31:55.467 --> 00:31:57.828]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:31:57.828 --> 00:31:58.329]  Others don't.
[00:32:00.439 --> 00:32:04.123]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:32:04.123 --> 00:32:05.405]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.405 --> 00:32:09.349]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:11.572]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.572 --> 00:32:16.978]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.418 --> 00:32:24.085]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:24.085 --> 00:32:30.072]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:30.072 --> 00:32:33.736]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.256 --> 00:32:38.537]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.537 --> 00:32:44.479]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:48.039]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.140]  It's here.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:57.942]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:58.979 --> 00:33:07.929]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:14.897]  So, we're seeing the Western-run Al-Qaeda groups.
[00:33:16.238 --> 00:33:22.704]  Engaging in mass murder, looting, and humanitarian atrocities.
[00:33:22.704 --> 00:33:30.272]  And we're seeing the official PSYOP that Tripoli totally fell yesterday falling apart.
[00:33:30.272 --> 00:33:36.358]  And we've got excellent articles at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson, Tony Cartolucci, and others.
[00:33:36.358 --> 00:33:40.522]  Libya, NATO, PSYOP collapses, Qaddafi prevails again.
[00:33:42.349 --> 00:33:48.452]  But you notice the rebels are going after the gold hordes and claim that they've taken the compound.
[00:33:48.452 --> 00:33:51.053]  Reportedly, the gold is buried.
[00:33:51.053 --> 00:33:54.495]  So they want that 144 tons of gold.
[00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:57.416]  At the end of the day, this is also about looting.
[00:33:57.416 --> 00:34:02.479]  They've got to make sure that that money never gets to the government or the people of Libya.
[00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:07.822]  And it will just disappear into a black hole, just like the tens of tons under the World Trade Center.
[00:34:07.822 --> 00:34:10.223]  And there'll be no discussion about it.
[00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:16.293]  Absolutely no discussion about it.
[00:34:16.293 --> 00:34:26.538]  Now I wanted to play a clip for you here of one of Gaddafi's sons.
[00:34:26.538 --> 00:34:35.643]  Reportedly yesterday, this is Mohammed Gaddafi in his home doing a radio slash TV interview
[00:34:37.289 --> 00:34:57.289]  When the Al Qaeda forces attack, Libyan conflict, Qaddafi's son captured live on television, while speaking live on television, Colonel Qaddafi's son, Mohamed, is attacked and captured, or Mohamed, is attacked and captured by Libyan rebels as they enter his home in Tripoli.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:08.388]  He was giving a phone interview with Al Jazeera Television confirming that he was under house arrest when shots suddenly rang out in the background as Libyan rebels stormed his home.
[00:35:08.388 --> 00:35:12.171]  I am being attacked right now, the dictator's son said, while on the air.
[00:35:12.171 --> 00:35:13.952]  This is gunfire inside my house.
[00:35:13.952 --> 00:35:15.854]  They are inside my house.
[00:35:15.854 --> 00:35:16.574]  Of course, I mean...
[00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:27.642]  Al Jazeera is publicly run by British intelligence, so immediately once he tried to contact the world, they were able to stick the special ops on him.
[00:35:27.642 --> 00:35:32.825]  You can clearly hear Mohammed repeating, there is no God but Allah, before the line went dead.
[00:35:32.825 --> 00:35:42.049]  Later confirming that Mohammed Gaddafi had been captured by the rebels, the head of Libya's National Transitional Council said that he was unhurt in the incident.
[00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:44.760]  This is so sick.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.064]  We're going to Paul Watson here in a moment, and then Webster Tarpley, but I wanted to play this powerful clip.
[00:35:50.064 --> 00:35:58.671]  But again, we don't know if it's true, because now it's reported as Saif al-Islam Qaddafi turns up free.
[00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:00.373]  Confusion reigns in Libya.
[00:36:00.373 --> 00:36:05.036]  Fresh fighting erupted in Tripoli today, hours after Mohammed Qaddafi's son
[00:36:06.477 --> 00:36:11.579]  Excuse me, Morimar Gaddafi's son turned up free to thwart Libyan rebels.
[00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:18.603]  Claims he had been captured, a move that seems to have energized forces still loyal to the embattled regime.
[00:36:18.603 --> 00:36:25.566]  And Gaddafi has put out new messages saying he's never going to give up, that he's going to go down with the ship.
[00:36:26.366 --> 00:36:29.948]  And he says this is foreign occupation Libyans resist.
[00:36:29.948 --> 00:36:30.868]  Let's go and go to this clip.
[00:36:30.868 --> 00:36:31.789]  Here it is.
[00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:37.032]  However, I can tell you the absence of wisdom and foresight is what brought us here today.
[00:36:37.032 --> 00:36:39.573]  Our differences could have been solved very easily.
[00:36:39.573 --> 00:36:45.796]  I'm being attacked right now.
[00:36:45.796 --> 00:36:46.796]  This is gunfire inside my house.
[00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:47.497]  They're inside my house.
[00:36:56.241 --> 00:36:57.183]  There's no God but Allah.
[00:36:57.183 --> 00:36:57.984]  No God but Allah.
[00:37:13.342 --> 00:37:14.382]  Well, there you go.
[00:37:14.382 --> 00:37:41.130]  There is the liberation of the 144 tons of gold, the liberation of thousands of people's lives, the carpet bombing of Tripoli and other cities, their entire infrastructure being decimated, huge areas going up in flame, U.S., British, other European troops literally commanding brigades of people who were in Iraq as short a time as just a year ago.
[00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.553]  People who brag in the news.
[00:37:44.553 --> 00:37:49.379]  You can just pull up Al Qaeda, Libyan rebels, brag of killing Americans.
[00:37:49.379 --> 00:37:53.503]  They're like, yes, we hate Americans, but we hate Qaddafi more.
[00:37:53.503 --> 00:38:00.171]  I will go back to killing Americans later, but now I kill Qaddafi.
[00:38:00.171 --> 00:38:02.274]  I mean, this is how sick the bankers are.
[00:38:03.353 --> 00:38:05.414]  Well of course, they created Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:05.414 --> 00:38:06.434]  So what do you expect?
[00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:10.296]  Joining us via video Skype for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:38:10.296 --> 00:38:12.396]  Obviously for radio listeners, you're tuning in.
[00:38:12.396 --> 00:38:16.158]  But if you're a radio listener and would like to watch, become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:38:16.158 --> 00:38:17.899]  That also supports the broadcast.
[00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:19.519]  Paul Watson reporting to us from England.
[00:38:19.519 --> 00:38:21.340]  You've been tracking this.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:28.603]  Look, yesterday, even though the media was announcing that Tripoli had totally fallen, all his sons were captured, Qaddafi would be captured within hours.
[00:38:29.563 --> 00:38:30.184]  I don't
[00:38:44.874 --> 00:38:51.398]  You know, you've got to sit here and watch these people being slaughtered and killed and watch the bankers using Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:51.398 --> 00:38:53.040]  It's just absolutely disgusting.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:00.624]  And at a certain level, you've got to see Gaddafi as the underdog and realize how he's held on to power for 40 years.
[00:39:00.624 --> 00:39:06.308]  He could have hightailed it to South Africa or scores of other countries that would have had him, but he didn't.
[00:39:06.308 --> 00:39:11.932]  He has chosen to stay behind with his sons and his entire family and undoubtedly die.
[00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:15.235]  I will say at this point, nothing is going to stop NATO.
[00:39:15.235 --> 00:39:16.276]  They will send in U.S.
[00:39:16.276 --> 00:39:16.596]  troops.
[00:39:16.596 --> 00:39:20.480]  They will send in the 1st Cav.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.502]  They will send in 3 Corps.
[00:39:22.502 --> 00:39:29.709]  They will level every building, kill every man, woman, and child, and rub the blood all over their faces with Al Qaeda in a celebration of death.
[00:39:29.709 --> 00:39:32.692]  They will be praised as our Al Qaeda saviors.
[00:39:32.692 --> 00:39:33.613]  This is incredible, Paul.
[00:39:35.438 --> 00:39:44.802]  Well, the latest, Alex, is that this assault on the Qaddafi compound is being led by, directed by, non-rebels.
[00:39:44.802 --> 00:39:50.244]  Basically, a non-rebel force is now directing the rebels with this assault on his compound.
[00:39:50.244 --> 00:39:55.807]  Now they're saying, according to Reuters, that Qaddafi may have escaped via underground tunnels, so again,
[00:39:56.647 --> 00:40:06.136]  Yesterday they said he'd left Tripoli, then Gaddafi told one of the big chess champions who gave an interview that he was still in Tripoli.
[00:40:06.136 --> 00:40:11.582]  So there's an element of Baghdad-Bob on both sides of the equation, but what we know for sure...
[00:40:12.737 --> 00:40:13.017]  Is that
[00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:42.981]  Fighter jets strafing Tripoli over the weekend, and then MI6 and NATO shipped in their al-Qaeda terrorists and the bloodbath began.
[00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:49.648]  But now it's admitted, the London Telegraph report, that MI6 is directing this entire operation.
[00:40:50.729 --> 00:41:03.897]  Uh, Debka File, uh, literally half an hour ago is reporting that this attack on Gaddafi's compound is being led by British, French, Jordanian, and Qatari special forces.
[00:41:03.897 --> 00:41:14.183]  Now, uh, Debka File were the ones who reported back in early July that NATO wanted Gaddafi toppled by the start of September, so they've been accurate in the past.
[00:41:14.183 --> 00:41:18.366]  Uh, and then you have other reports that the rebels are being directed by a quote, non-
[00:41:18.766 --> 00:41:19.566]  Rebel presence.
[00:41:19.566 --> 00:41:30.270]  So while we have the establishment media again engaging in this mass hoax that this is some organic uprising, it's all being led by globalist forces.
[00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:36.112]  They want the oil, they want the gold, they want Libya as a springboard to attack other countries.
[00:41:36.112 --> 00:41:41.374]  And as we predicted at the beginning of July, the window is now.
[00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:43.214]  They need to get it done before that.
[00:41:43.214 --> 00:41:47.296]  That's right, Libya has got great air bases to menace Egypt.
[00:41:47.816 --> 00:41:49.037]  That's another big part of this.
[00:41:49.037 --> 00:41:57.583]  Plus, Libya was financing the development of Africa and had the highest standard of living in Africa now, eclipsing South Africa.
[00:41:57.583 --> 00:42:00.124]  That could not be allowed, just like Serbia.
[00:42:00.124 --> 00:42:05.508]  Nothing like a good DU bombing to triple birth defects, slaughter some people.
[00:42:05.508 --> 00:42:08.170]  And will Obama get a second peace prize?
[00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.010]  I'm not joking.
[00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:09.751]  Mainstream media
[00:42:10.351 --> 00:42:14.958]  Just a few weeks ago said he should be given a second Peace Prize, Paul.
[00:42:14.958 --> 00:42:17.903]  Perhaps we should give Hitler one posthumously.
[00:42:19.994 --> 00:42:41.077]  Well, I mean precisely, and it's going to go beyond just supporting these rebels by the looks of it, because once it collapses into anarchy and tribal warfare, which is what everybody expects it to do, especially with these 10,000 to 15,000 United Arab Emirates troops that they're planning on sending in after,
[00:42:41.778 --> 00:42:48.963]  The British government today admitted that they have troops on standby for basically an occupation.
[00:42:48.963 --> 00:42:53.326]  They're not going to call it an occupation, they're going to call it a peacekeeping force.
[00:42:53.326 --> 00:42:57.929]  Well they've got 12,000... Exactly, a peacekeeping, kinetic, loving action.
[00:42:57.929 --> 00:43:01.291]  They've got at least 12,000 US Marines off the coast.
[00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:03.812]  Right now they've got British troops off the coast.
[00:43:03.812 --> 00:43:05.954]  I'm sure they're just there to sightsee though, Paul.
[00:43:07.452 --> 00:43:18.417]  Well, precisely, even though the original EU intervention plan said that, you know, their mission was to, quote, secure sea and land corridors inside the country.
[00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:21.659]  That doesn't sound like a humanitarian objective to me.
[00:43:21.659 --> 00:43:24.040]  It sounds like a military objective.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:33.925]  What, are you going to tell me that we've been lied to, that the four-and-a-half-month bombing campaign is not humanitarian, that Obama said weeks, I mean days, not weeks?
[00:43:33.925 --> 00:43:35.086]  Clearly he's been truthful there.
[00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:38.651]  I mean, next year, are you against Al-Qaeda?
[00:43:38.651 --> 00:43:42.838]  Because they admit the main force is Al-Qaeda and brags of killing U.S.
[00:43:42.838 --> 00:43:44.341]  troops.
[00:43:44.341 --> 00:43:47.346]  I mean, why don't... What's wrong with you, Paul?
[00:43:47.346 --> 00:43:48.868]  I mean, what's wrong with Al-Qaeda?
[00:43:50.643 --> 00:43:53.727]  Well, I mean, certainly nothing if you're MI6.
[00:43:53.727 --> 00:44:08.326]  I mean, the same group, the Libyan Al-Qaeda cell, that MI6 paid $100,000 in 1996 to assassinate Gaddafi, after Gaddafi himself had put out an Interpol arrest warrant against Bin Laden,
[00:44:08.806 --> 00:44:10.146]  Oh, we can't allow that.
[00:44:10.146 --> 00:44:21.110]  So they paid this Islamic fighting group, which is going to become one of the main power players in the post-Qadhafi regime, $100,000 to assassinate Qadhafi.
[00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.011]  That's MI6.
[00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:23.851]  So, I mean...
[00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:44.756]  The fact that we've got troops in Afghanistan and Iraq fighting this multi-generational war on terror while simultaneously training, arming and funding this Al-Qaeda group that admittedly has killed US troops to take power in Libya post-Gaddafi just illustrates how the whole war on terror is a monumental fraud.
[00:44:45.697 --> 00:44:56.962]  Well, once the Al-Qaeda forces, and they admit that's the dominant group in the new government, have that country, they're undoubtedly going to use it as a base, just like after Afghanistan was turned over to Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:56.962 --> 00:45:04.605]  They were then used to be the scapegoats for 9-11 as a new pretext, and they just move Al-Qaeda around anywhere they want to invade.
[00:45:04.605 --> 00:45:06.306]  They either have Al-Qaeda attack you,
[00:45:06.846 --> 00:45:20.516]  And then the West comes into their aid, Serbia, now Libya, Afghanistan, or they claim Al Qaeda has carried out attacks that they didn't really carry out as a pretext to have the security services set up a police state domestically.
[00:45:20.516 --> 00:45:22.958]  This is incredibly transparent, but the fact that
[00:45:23.718 --> 00:45:42.664]  British Special Forces and others are running the attack in Tripoli is true evidence of how we've been lied to all along here and the fact that his son Saif al-Islam has been proven to be alive and not captured really illustrates that this is a fluid situation.
[00:45:42.664 --> 00:45:45.405]  Thank you so much, Paul Joseph Watson from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:46.052 --> 00:45:46.553]  Thanks Alex.
[00:46:08.654 --> 00:46:09.996]  Can be.
[00:46:09.996 --> 00:46:28.517]  But Webster Tarpley, yesterday you said there was reports of counterattacks and journalists you were talking to said what they saw on the streets was Libyan forces clashing and crushing the rebels, but that there were what appeared to be special forces sniping Western reporters and others.
[00:46:28.877 --> 00:46:48.178]  So this looks like a classic special forces op where they're just showing total bedlam within the city announcing they've taken it as a pretext to recognize it as the government who then will then call in the official flotilla, the landing craft that are waiting offshore with NATO mercenaries.
[00:46:49.113 --> 00:46:50.855]  That's a very plausible scenario, Alex.
[00:46:50.855 --> 00:46:57.621]  Let me just point out the shock of the appearance of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi.
[00:46:57.621 --> 00:46:59.123]  Saif means shield.
[00:46:59.123 --> 00:47:00.925]  He's the shield of Islam.
[00:47:00.925 --> 00:47:03.407]  This is Gaddafi's principal son.
[00:47:03.407 --> 00:47:07.351]  He's probably the likely political successor to Gaddafi.
[00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:23.819]  You remember that all day yesterday we had been told that first one, then two, then three of Gaddafi's sons had been captured by these Al-Qaeda terrorists, and that already the International Criminal Court with the scoundrel Ocampo were demanding their expedition and all this stuff.
[00:47:23.819 --> 00:47:27.041]  This was all complete psychological warfare.
[00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:32.564]  So last night, in the middle of the night, at this Rixos Hotel, which is the base of the international press,
[00:47:33.264 --> 00:47:35.588]  Saif al-Islam Gaddafi shows up.
[00:47:35.588 --> 00:47:37.170]  He says, I was never captured.
[00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.331]  I'm here.
[00:47:38.331 --> 00:47:41.996]  I'm on a tour of our fighting fronts here.
[00:47:41.996 --> 00:47:43.999]  We're going to go all around Tripoli.
[00:47:43.999 --> 00:47:45.461]  He took some journalists with him.
[00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:48.025]  I don't know what the reports are after that.
[00:47:48.605 --> 00:47:50.186]  This was an absolute shock.
[00:47:50.186 --> 00:47:54.607]  You could tune to Al Jazeera and see these people gasping.
[00:47:54.607 --> 00:47:57.188]  They had egg all over their faces.
[00:47:57.188 --> 00:48:00.369]  And what it exposes is the big lie.
[00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:06.751]  Also what Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said, that this is an information war.
[00:48:06.751 --> 00:48:09.531]  This is electronic information warfare.
[00:48:09.531 --> 00:48:12.512]  It's info wars, as you have known for all these years.
[00:48:12.512 --> 00:48:14.173]  It's an information war.
[00:48:14.973 --> 00:48:16.595]  And it's done through manipulation.
[00:48:16.595 --> 00:48:19.819]  And you said NATO cut off our own Libyan television.
[00:48:19.819 --> 00:48:27.867]  They were sending these text messages to people all over Libya saying that Gaddafi was finished and the rebels were now on the march.
[00:48:27.867 --> 00:48:29.029]  And then you see what they had.
[00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:30.831]  It's basically a rabble.
[00:48:31.671 --> 00:48:35.555]  A screening force of terrorists and young dupes, right?
[00:48:35.555 --> 00:48:39.398]  Young romantics, camp followers who come along with them.
[00:48:39.398 --> 00:48:45.743]  They got that into the city through these NATO landing craft and they've created mayhem.
[00:48:45.743 --> 00:48:51.307]  But everything you see from here is a big lie and people have got to bear this in mind.
[00:48:51.307 --> 00:48:52.869]  It's all fake.
[00:48:52.869 --> 00:48:54.710]  You don't know what's going on.
[00:48:55.911 --> 00:49:04.796]  First they said they had 90% of the city, now they say they had 80% of the city yesterday, and now they say within 72 hours they'll have the city.
[00:49:04.796 --> 00:49:19.605]  And now they're saying they've taken Gaddafi's compound, now they're saying that might not be true, and it's confirmed that they've got a whole bunch of different Western and Arab special forces in there, just running around trying to kill whoever they can.
[00:49:19.605 --> 00:49:22.607]  I mean, this is a serious war crime, Webster.
[00:49:22.887 --> 00:49:24.989]  Yeah, I guess you can call it swarming.
[00:49:24.989 --> 00:49:35.160]  I mean, we became familiar with this term, swarming, thanks to the work of the Albert Einstein Institute there in Boston, right?
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.804]  Swarming adolescents can be used as a tactic.
[00:49:38.804 --> 00:49:39.605]  And that's what you're seeing.
[00:49:39.605 --> 00:49:41.267]  These are swarming adolescents.
[00:49:41.787 --> 00:49:45.331]  Except they also have machine guns.
[00:49:45.331 --> 00:49:52.699]  Remember, it's impossible for the Qaddafi forces to hold any fixed position because of the NATO bombing.
[00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:55.722]  The NATO carpet bombing has been extremely intense.
[00:49:55.722 --> 00:49:58.605]  There are these Apache helicopters there shooting up everything.
[00:49:59.385 --> 00:50:00.386]  It's a shell game.
[00:50:00.386 --> 00:50:08.691]  They've got to continue to move around and then fight the Al-Qaeda Western forces in hit and runs.
[00:50:08.691 --> 00:50:10.932]  But Webster, I'm going to go back to this.
[00:50:10.932 --> 00:50:21.118]  They are only days now from, quote, having the official government, Al-Qaeda, call for the larger NATO landing force to come in.
[00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:26.622]  And that's when you're going to really see the casualties mount, because there are going to be a lot of citizens
[00:50:27.162 --> 00:50:33.446]  With those millions of firearms that are really going to fight when they see an open foreign occupation, and the bloodbath is going to be intense.
[00:50:33.446 --> 00:50:35.267]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[00:50:35.267 --> 00:50:36.948]  I think that's a definite danger.
[00:50:36.948 --> 00:50:53.199]  We're also told that there's this Potemkin village, there's a fake Libyan town that's been built in Qatar, and they can stage a Hollywood-style massacre in such a place, and then say, now it's enough, Gaddafi has gone too far.
[00:50:53.199 --> 00:50:54.500]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:59.523]  Yeah, babies and incubators coming up.
[00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:00.744]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.744 --> 00:51:05.968]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:05.968 --> 00:51:15.335]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.
[00:51:15.335 --> 00:51:26.103]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels
[00:51:26.223 --> 00:51:26.563]  I think so.
[00:51:44.775 --> 00:51:47.136]  That's over 30% off the retail price.
[00:51:47.136 --> 00:51:48.076]  Call the Berkey guy at 1-877-886-3653.
[00:51:48.076 --> 00:51:48.296]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:51:49.097 --> 00:51:49.797]  That's GoBerkey.com today!

[00:52:47.784 --> 00:52:50.665]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:53:01.283 --> 00:53:05.966]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:53:05.966 --> 00:53:12.410]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.672]  Number one, study the past.
[00:53:14.672 --> 00:53:17.073]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:53:17.073 --> 00:53:20.796]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:25.015]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:53:25.015 --> 00:53:28.858]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:53:28.858 --> 00:53:33.902]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:53:33.902 --> 00:53:37.325]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:53:37.905 --> 00:53:41.306]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:53:41.306 --> 00:53:45.807]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:53:45.807 --> 00:53:50.728]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:53:50.728 --> 00:53:55.349]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:57.510]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:54:08.263 --> 00:54:08.886]  Yeah.
[00:54:26.081 --> 00:54:29.944]  Okay, Webster, you've got the floor for this short five-minute segment.
[00:54:29.944 --> 00:54:32.866]  What about the issue of the West being fully committed?
[00:54:32.866 --> 00:54:39.210]  Obama is announcing that we've had a victory in Libya, even though it's clearly not a victory.
[00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.812]  Either way, you slice it, and things are still ongoing.
[00:54:41.812 --> 00:54:44.553]  McCain says it's all over, even though it's not.
[00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:47.515]  Clearly a giant PSYOP.
[00:54:47.515 --> 00:54:50.317]  And now there's going to be a civil war there.
[00:54:50.317 --> 00:54:52.279]  It's going to take massive occupation.
[00:54:52.279 --> 00:54:55.681]  As you know, historically, Libya, they do not like being occupied.
[00:54:56.602 --> 00:54:57.825]  Well, the, um...
[00:55:03.787 --> 00:55:08.351]  The first thing to say is this is an exercise in mass brainwashing.
[00:55:08.351 --> 00:55:18.159]  This is an attempt to brainwash world public opinion on the basis of fake dispatches from the BBC, Al Jazeera, and CNN.
[00:55:18.159 --> 00:55:29.307]  And they have essentially manufactured these stories about the three sons of Gaddafi being captured as a means to try to convince the Gaddafi supporters that their world is coming to an end.
[00:55:29.307 --> 00:55:32.530]  I mean, if you go back to the Obama campaign, you can find similar
[00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:33.490]  We're good to go.
[00:55:57.782 --> 00:56:02.586]  But this is a kind of, the military term I guess is a coup de main.
[00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:09.071]  It's a quick action that's designed to stun and shock and to paralyze resistance.
[00:56:09.071 --> 00:56:16.397]  But the problem is if that doesn't work 100% in the first moment, then a counterattack can be organized.
[00:56:16.397 --> 00:56:17.738]  And I think that's what we're seeing.
[00:56:17.738 --> 00:56:26.685]  I would, for students of the American Civil War, if you remember the Battle of Cedar Creek in October 1864 out here in the Shenandoah Valley.
[00:56:27.265 --> 00:56:37.013]  Early Confederates were successful with a surprise attack on Sheridan's Union forces, and they drove the Union guys from the field.
[00:56:37.013 --> 00:56:38.494]  There was a rout of the Union.
[00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:45.340]  Except then, early Confederates were so hungry that they stopped and started to loot the camp.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.001]  And I think you're seeing that here.
[00:56:47.001 --> 00:56:52.465]  These Al-Qaeda characters coming into Tripoli, they say, this is richer than anything we've ever seen.
[00:56:52.465 --> 00:56:54.247]  We're going to stop here and loot.
[00:56:54.247 --> 00:56:56.589]  And I think that's a sociological thing that's going on.
[00:56:57.089 --> 00:57:04.373]  Then, however, Sheridan comes riding back on his horse, and he rallies everybody, and they counterattack.
[00:57:04.373 --> 00:57:09.977]  And I think you can compare Saeed al-Islam Gaddafi appearing at the Rixos Hotel last night.
[00:57:09.977 --> 00:57:15.800]  That's the defiant rallying figure that you need to get your forces going again, and I think that's what you're seeing.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.722]  That's now about, what, 10 or 12 hours in the past.
[00:57:19.862 --> 00:57:26.867]  Don't expect the Qaddafi forces to hold any fixed positions because they can't because of the NATO bombing.
[00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:29.829]  I would like to know how many rebels have been killed.
[00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:40.895]  I think in the course of the advance on Tripoli, the rebels had very heavy casualties and they are not, you know, without problems of manpower.
[00:57:40.895 --> 00:57:42.797]  So I think that's something you don't hear about.
[00:57:42.797 --> 00:57:47.840]  How many rebels have paid with their lives for all of this television stuff?
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:56.323]  Think about other examples in history of where taking the capital of the supposed enemy turned out not to be what you wanted to do.
[00:57:56.323 --> 00:58:02.826]  I guess the most famous, Napoleon was allowed to take Moscow and then he found that Moscow was a trap.
[00:58:02.826 --> 00:58:09.089]  Maybe these terrorists have taken Tripoli to some extent and now they're finding that what they took was a trap.
[00:58:10.189 --> 00:58:12.711]  There's also the whole question of Libya's huge country.
[00:58:12.711 --> 00:58:16.413]  It goes, you know, several thousand kilometers south.
[00:58:16.413 --> 00:58:26.240]  And this whole province of Fezzan, where the population is largely black, they are not going to accept the yoke of Benghazi and those racists.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.543]  Well, that's because that particular Arab group literally kills blacks on sight.
[00:58:30.543 --> 00:58:35.286]  And so now this is Obama's little gift to Africa is going to be an attempted black genocide.
[00:58:35.286 --> 00:58:37.087]  Webster Griffin Tarver, thank you.
[00:58:37.087 --> 00:58:38.188]  Thank you so much.
[00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:38.948]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:39.409]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.213 --> 00:58:50.698]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.698 --> 00:58:54.201]  Hi folks, Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.
[00:58:54.201 --> 00:58:59.526]  In August, we're celebrating our 30-year anniversary in the long-term food supply industry.

[00:59:06.232 --> 00:59:09.454]  That's 30% off of our Freedom Food Supply.
[00:59:09.454 --> 00:59:13.517]  You save $536 on each one-year supply.
[00:59:13.517 --> 00:59:16.799]  That's lower than 1981 prices.
[00:59:16.799 --> 00:59:20.661]  If you ever thought about getting a year's supply of food, now is the time.
[00:59:20.661 --> 00:59:26.125]  This whole one-year supply is a balanced selection of foods and it all fits in the space of a washing machine.
[00:59:26.445 --> 00:59:28.526]  You know you need your own food.
[00:59:28.526 --> 00:59:30.106]  But time is running out.
[00:59:30.106 --> 00:59:35.208]  This 30% off sale for the best food on the planet ends Friday, August 26th.
[00:59:35.208 --> 00:59:36.609]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:59:36.609 --> 00:59:38.049]  This sale ends Friday, August 26th.
[00:59:38.049 --> 00:59:40.991]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:59:53.604 --> 00:59:55.990]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:58.757]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:10.179]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:11.760]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.321]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:17.504]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.504 --> 01:00:21.567]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.977 --> 01:00:40.680]  NATO has taken Tripoli like Napoleon took Moscow.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.163]  Or Hitler took Leningrad.
[01:00:44.163 --> 01:00:46.905]  And that's exactly what's going on here.
[01:00:46.905 --> 01:00:49.548]  And regardless, we've now entered a new Vietnam.
[01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:55.685]  And I guess they're not going to care because they're going to try to use mainly Arab troops in there.
[01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:58.128]  But we know we're not getting the official story.
[01:00:58.128 --> 01:01:00.250]  So how do you see this ending?
[01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:03.513]  Because the media is saying, what's next in Libya?
[01:01:03.513 --> 01:01:05.294]  Key to US politics.
[01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:08.618]  AP is still going with the fact that the war is over.
[01:01:09.498 --> 01:01:13.940]  Others are saying, look out, this is a civil war.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.921]  Who was behind this?
[01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:22.405]  We know the bankers want the 144 tons of gold and they want the infrastructure, Webster, but this is going to be a nightmare situation.
[01:01:23.799 --> 01:01:40.066]  Remember, there's a secret treaty signed between the British and the French on November 2nd of last year, and that set up the overall attack on Libya, Operation South Mistral, which is also known as Operation Hamattan.
[01:01:40.066 --> 01:01:45.948]  And Hamattan is another word for that same wind, right, that Mediterranean wind called the Mistral.
[01:01:46.548 --> 01:01:49.252]  So, this was cynically planned well in advance.
[01:01:49.252 --> 01:01:53.659]  They were doing bombing drills and everything else for what we're seeing right now.
[01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:58.426]  And they launched the Al Qaeda forces, they're called protesters, and the rest is history.
[01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:00.171]  Correct.
[01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:08.696]  And remember that there are vast areas of southern Libya where the writ of NATO will not run, especially that Fezzan province.
[01:02:08.696 --> 01:02:15.880]  The whole southwestern part of Libya is this Fezzan where most everybody is black.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.181]  They're Libyans, they're Arabs, but they're black.
[01:02:18.181 --> 01:02:20.302]  So they're not going to listen to the yoke.
[01:02:20.302 --> 01:02:21.583]  They're not going to subject themselves.
[01:02:21.963 --> 01:02:25.147]  South Africa won't turn its back on Gaddafi because he's been helping the region.
[01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:45.188]  Well, the loyalties of some of these people are not what you'd like it to be.
[01:02:45.188 --> 01:02:48.530]  But still, there is a large area there.
[01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:53.734]  A government in exile or something like that could go on for a very long time.
[01:02:53.734 --> 01:02:58.898]  And again, it's going to come down now to a series of tribal vendettas.
[01:02:58.898 --> 01:03:02.000]  But on the other hand, I don't think we should get that far ahead.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.342]  Right now, Qaddafi is in the field.
[01:03:04.342 --> 01:03:05.282]  He's defiant.
[01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:06.003]  He's fighting.
[01:03:06.003 --> 01:03:08.685]  His son Saif is leading attacks.
[01:03:09.165 --> 01:03:16.213]  His other son, Thomas, was leading a tank attack on the Green Square yesterday, which seems to have succeeded, at least for a while.
[01:03:16.213 --> 01:03:23.400]  So I think you've got to get used to a period of prolonged, continuous warfare, with constant
[01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:32.390]  Let's not forget that the rebels took a bunch of cities and Gaddafi took them back, but here's the deal.
[01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:37.456]  They've committed Western Special Forces, that's confirmed, London Telegraph, you name it.
[01:03:37.456 --> 01:03:39.899]  They've committed them into Tripoli now.
[01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.641]  Webster, I think you're going to see within
[01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:52.395]  Two or three days, I think you're going to see more, more Western forces going in, and they can't now be defeated by Qaddafi with all their bluster.
[01:03:52.395 --> 01:04:02.798]  I think you're going to see a full-on invasion, and they're just committing to an absolute, full-on civil war, shooting gallery, and a lot of dead Western and other Arab troops.
[01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:07.840]  This is a humanitarian disaster of giant proportions.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:17.564]  It's a definite possibility, but of course that then leads to prolonged guerrilla warfare, extravagant casualties, rivers of blood.
[01:04:17.564 --> 01:04:28.988]  Right now, it would be good for Russia and China, or somebody with some conscience, to go to the UN Security Council and immediately demand a ceasefire to put an end to this.
[01:04:28.988 --> 01:04:32.530]  All foreign forces out of Libya... We've only got 20 seconds.
[01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:35.291]  Why isn't Russia saying something about this?
[01:04:35.874 --> 01:04:47.686]  Well, Russia's now in the throes of a, I guess you could call it a succession or a political struggle, I think, between these Medvedev people and the Putin people.
[01:04:47.686 --> 01:04:53.331]  And they're also, the Russians are not, they've drawn the line, I think, for Syria.
[01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:54.592]  They haven't done so for Libya.
[01:04:54.592 --> 01:04:55.813]  All right, Webster, thank you.
[01:04:55.813 --> 01:04:56.274]  We're out of time.
[01:04:56.274 --> 01:04:59.937]  We're going to come back with another guest on this subject and the economy and a lot more.
[01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:00.378]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.698 --> 01:05:01.859]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.859 --> 01:05:08.802]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.802 --> 01:05:11.363]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.363 --> 01:05:16.726]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.726 --> 01:05:19.767]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.767 --> 01:05:21.828]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.088 --> 01:05:28.333]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.715]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.715 --> 01:05:37.500]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.141]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.141 --> 01:05:40.442]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.442 --> 01:05:43.124]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.124 --> 01:05:47.347]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.347 --> 01:05:49.369]  You can find the video at www.
[01:05:50.129 --> 01:05:51.953]  End of America 3 dot com.
[01:05:51.953 --> 01:05:54.538]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.
[01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:58.426]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:58.426 --> 01:05:59.428]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:06.343]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:06:06.343 --> 01:06:12.790]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:15.073]  Number one, study the past.
[01:06:15.073 --> 01:06:17.455]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:06:17.455 --> 01:06:21.179]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:06:22.287 --> 01:06:25.389]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:06:25.389 --> 01:06:29.232]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:06:29.232 --> 01:06:34.276]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:06:34.276 --> 01:06:38.278]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:06:38.278 --> 01:06:41.701]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:06:41.701 --> 01:06:45.323]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:46.164 --> 01:06:51.113]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:06:51.113 --> 01:06:55.741]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:55.741 --> 01:06:58.445]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:05.242]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.242 --> 01:07:08.485]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.485 --> 01:07:13.650]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:19.675]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.675 --> 01:07:21.918]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:22.758]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.758 --> 01:07:23.258]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.258 --> 01:07:23.638]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.638 --> 01:07:25.039]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:27.460]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.365 --> 01:07:45.731]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:07:45.731 --> 01:07:48.635]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:48.635 --> 01:07:57.766]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:08:02.133 --> 01:08:08.756]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.756 --> 01:08:21.620]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:28.503]  Harley Schlanger is going to be joining us in a moment to talk about the state of the world, the economy, what's happening in Libya, and a lot more.
[01:08:28.503 --> 01:08:30.424]  We'll introduce our guest here in a moment.
[01:08:31.769 --> 01:08:34.810]  But here's some of the financial news headlines right now.
[01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:38.171]  New home sales fall in 2011.
[01:08:38.171 --> 01:08:41.352]  It could be the worst year yet.
[01:08:41.352 --> 01:08:46.874]  Shaping up to be the worst since records have been kept dating back 50 years.
[01:08:46.874 --> 01:08:48.534]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:08:48.534 --> 01:08:56.937]  World stock markets rise amid hopes for the Fed to announce QE3 or further dollar devaluation.
[01:08:57.717 --> 01:09:07.248]  Continuing, Goldman Sachs shares opened 5% lower today as boss hires corporate lawyer who defended fraudsters from Enron.
[01:09:07.248 --> 01:09:10.192]  Investors fear more probes into financial wrongdoing.
[01:09:11.138 --> 01:09:19.203]  Well, the Senatorial Committee has found that they knowingly sold fraudulent derivatives to everyone knowing it was worthless crud.
[01:09:19.203 --> 01:09:21.664]  Continuing here with other financial news.
[01:09:21.664 --> 01:09:23.645]  Gold goes off the charts.
[01:09:23.645 --> 01:09:26.447]  It went to, what, $1,910 yesterday.
[01:09:26.447 --> 01:09:33.531]  Been gyrating back and forth today as Gartman sees prices for metals heading parabolic.
[01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:39.454]  Goldman Sachs, of course, two weeks ago said $2,500 by the end of the year on the announcements that they are considering QE3.
[01:09:41.454 --> 01:09:46.105]  Federal stimulus funds for Nevada's green industry grows trees, but few jobs.
[01:09:46.105 --> 01:09:48.330]  Well, it's only designed to be given to insiders.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:10:00.709]  Continuing, they're also making announcements about how they do want to go ahead and cut the military pensions of people that have served 20 or more years.
[01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:03.711]  A head of a rating agency, S&P, is stepping down.
[01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:08.936]  Head of the rating agency, S&P, is stepping down to leave company at the year's end.
[01:10:08.936 --> 01:10:10.337]  U.S.
[01:10:10.337 --> 01:10:14.020]  becomes food stamp nation, but is it sustainable?
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:17.623]  Really, $45 million on total food stamps, $5 million on supplemental.
[01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:23.907]  That's 50 million people in an electronic soup kitchen line every single day.
[01:10:23.907 --> 01:10:25.288]  That's out of Yahoo News.
[01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:28.210]  Also, America is rotting while China is rising.
[01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:31.132]  They're building super trains, new roads, you name it.
[01:10:31.132 --> 01:10:33.834]  The United States is totally rotting by design.
[01:10:33.834 --> 01:10:35.375]  The post-industrial world.
[01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:38.758]  Even Martin Luther King's memorial was made in China.
[01:10:39.478 --> 01:10:43.782]  A fitting example of what the globalists have done.
[01:10:43.782 --> 01:11:00.815]  It's what the UN said they would do with Agenda 21 back in 1992, when Maurice Strong said, we're going to de-industrialize the US, we're going to use environmentalism to shut the United States off, then bankrupting the population for foreign corporate occupation.
[01:11:01.904 --> 01:11:13.570]  And then the few jobs that are left will be through government corporate welfare and basically you'll have a mercenary population that rules over the rest of us here in the giant prison economy.
[01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:20.529]  And to talk about the state of the world is Harley Schlanger.
[01:11:20.529 --> 01:11:28.436]  And he, again, has been the Executive Intelligence Review's Magazine Southwest Bureau Chief for more than 15 years.
[01:11:28.436 --> 01:11:33.140]  And in recent years, he's become the national spokesman for London LaRouche's Political Action Committee.
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.282]  I always like to get their perspective on things.
[01:11:35.282 --> 01:11:41.407]  As Bureau Chief, he's written numerous articles, including the savings and loan crisis, predicting that.
[01:11:42.508 --> 01:11:47.451]  As an investigative journalist, Schlanger has contributed to a number of books published by EIR.
[01:11:47.451 --> 01:11:54.214]  Some of his research was incorporated in The Ugly Truth About the ADL, Bush's Unauthorized Biography, for example.
[01:11:54.214 --> 01:11:56.675]  Schlanger himself made a run for the U.S.
[01:11:56.675 --> 01:12:00.217]  Senate, receiving a quarter million votes for the Texas Democratic primary.
[01:12:00.217 --> 01:12:00.957]  He holds a B.A.
[01:12:00.957 --> 01:12:02.238]  from the University of Wisconsin.
[01:12:04.179 --> 01:12:14.568]  And a MA in European History from Rutgers University, where he was the National Defense Education Act Fellow for three years, larouchepac.com, larouchepub.com.
[01:12:14.568 --> 01:12:20.112]  He joins us for the rest of the hour via video Skype from, what, Houston, Texas.
[01:12:20.112 --> 01:12:23.054]  And Harley, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:12:23.054 --> 01:12:25.817]  So much of what I saw you writing about 15 years ago,
[01:12:26.477 --> 01:12:35.104]  Sixteen years ago when I first became aware of your research, I was a bit skeptical at the time, but most of it has now come to pass.
[01:12:35.104 --> 01:12:41.769]  And so I'd like you to give us your worldview in a historical perspective and where the world is at this point.
[01:12:41.769 --> 01:12:42.470]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:44.548]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[01:12:44.548 --> 01:12:46.070]  Good to be with you.
[01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:50.376]  The place to start is that the system is melting down.
[01:12:50.376 --> 01:12:51.777]  It's disappearing.
[01:12:51.777 --> 01:12:57.905]  The attempt to bail it out is, at best, going to lead to a hyperinflationary implosion.
[01:12:57.905 --> 01:13:01.970]  But if they don't bail it out, there's going to be a full-scale bankruptcy.
[01:13:02.951 --> 01:13:07.954]  Starting with one big bank or another, the banks have frozen up again.
[01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:17.398]  We're a little bit like what Lyndon LaRouche saw in July 2007, when he said the banking system is frozen up and it is finished.
[01:13:17.398 --> 01:13:24.702]  It took about a year before that was generally realized, and then in the September 2008 period with the fall of Lehman and others,
[01:13:25.362 --> 01:13:34.670]  It became clear that the banks had completely frozen, which meant they couldn't loan to each other because they knew they were loaning based on worthless assets.
[01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:44.878]  At that point, in September 2008, we had what was called TARP, and it was really hammered through the Congress under threat that the whole system was going to collapse if we didn't do it.
[01:13:45.538 --> 01:13:58.324]  Now, in effect, they bought a little time, but we've created anywhere from $16 trillion to $25 trillion in worthless paper, which is backing up worthless assets.
[01:13:58.324 --> 01:14:00.285]  And, as you know, there's probably...
[01:14:06.505 --> 01:14:14.088]  Okay, Harley, your video Skype is breaking up.
[01:14:14.088 --> 01:14:17.690]  If it doesn't clear up in a moment, we're going to call you right back on the phone.
[01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:19.651]  Back up.
[01:14:19.651 --> 01:14:23.973]  Has Skype cleared back up yet?
[01:14:23.973 --> 01:14:27.635]  Okay, Harley, the last 30 seconds of what you said was breaking up.
[01:14:27.635 --> 01:14:28.235]  Please repeat it.
[01:14:29.355 --> 01:14:30.055]  Sure.
[01:14:30.055 --> 01:14:42.740]  We had created by Bernanke, Geithner, and first Hank Paulson, and then under Obama, trillions of dollars to back up worthless financial assets.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.281]  Those assets should have been cleared out of the banks.
[01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:52.803]  We should have had a bankruptcy reorganization in September 2008, and a return to Glass-Steagall regulations.
[01:14:52.803 --> 01:14:57.085]  Instead, the decision was made to bail out the bankrupt banking system.
[01:14:57.845 --> 01:15:02.354]  And we see this happening now in Europe, where all of the banks are getting money from the U.S.
[01:15:02.354 --> 01:15:07.243]  Federal Reserve, which is, I'm sure, an impeachable offense by President Obama.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.182]  The system itself is melting down.
[01:15:10.182 --> 01:15:13.284]  The attempt to bail it out is not going to work.
[01:15:13.284 --> 01:15:20.449]  And the only remedy we have is to go back to constitutional credit policies, starting with Glass-Steagall.
[01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:24.392]  But the real, the other point, Alex, is we've got to get rid of Obama.
[01:15:24.392 --> 01:15:25.873]  We can't wait until January 2013.
[01:15:25.873 --> 01:15:30.716]  He's committed so many violations and offenses and
[01:15:31.997 --> 01:15:42.407]  Impeachable offenses that the question is will there be anybody with the guts in the US to stand up in the Congress or in the administration and remove him?
[01:15:43.134 --> 01:15:44.836]  Well, Harley, that was my next question.
[01:15:44.836 --> 01:15:48.740]  It's clear that the ruling class is in a crisis.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.885]  They're consolidating power through this implosion that they've engineered.
[01:15:52.885 --> 01:16:00.534]  But at the same time, the black hole they've created is threatening to swallow them up as well.
[01:16:00.534 --> 01:16:01.435]  And we see things.
[01:16:03.437 --> 01:16:04.438]  Really getting scary.
[01:16:04.438 --> 01:16:08.221]  I mean, basically Obama has become a dictator.
[01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:13.505]  The office is being used by the bureaucracy and the special interest.
[01:16:13.505 --> 01:16:15.607]  It's being empowered for the dictatorship.
[01:16:15.607 --> 01:16:17.689]  I'm not saying he's a dictator himself.
[01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:30.519]  He's obviously an empty suit teleprompter reader, but launching wars without congressional approval, gun control laws without congressional approval, carbon taxes without congressional approval, amnesty without congressional approval.
[01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:30.699]  I mean,
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.761]  They're openly saying they now have the Super Congress.
[01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:40.422]  Do you agree that there's a move towards an end of the constitutional form of government?
[01:16:40.422 --> 01:16:42.063]  I think it's going to happen very quickly.
[01:16:42.063 --> 01:16:49.965]  They use the debt ceiling debate to create enabling legislation for a financial dictatorship.
[01:16:49.965 --> 01:16:54.606]  In a sense, what Bernanke is doing is an example of a dictatorship.
[01:16:54.606 --> 01:16:58.647]  No elected official has any say over what the Fed is doing.
[01:16:59.207 --> 01:17:12.635]  And it's rumored that Bernanke on Friday is going to come up with a QE3, Quantitative Easing 3, and in fact he's already doing that through the back door with these dollar swap arrangements where, I mean, Alex, I think this is important.
[01:17:12.635 --> 01:17:21.961]  Trillions of dollars is going from the Federal Reserve to bail out BNP Paribas, Societe Generale of France, Royal Bank of Stockholm.
[01:17:21.961 --> 01:17:26.684]  They got 85 billion dollars in just one bailout fund.
[01:17:27.384 --> 01:17:41.740]  So, this is already going on, and the enabling legislation, LaRouche has compared this to what Hitler did in early 1933, when they used the Reichstag fire as an excuse for dictatorship.
[01:17:42.281 --> 01:17:59.892]  Now, we're seeing something like that, another terrorist act, more war, anything of that sort, or perhaps riots in the United States over the hopelessness around unemployment and the fascist austerity measures that will be rammed through by a super-Congress dictatorship.
[01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:06.517]  You could see an excuse for that kind of police state crackdown with a lot of the measures already in place for it.
[01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:16.247]  And by the way, you're not just saying that this Council of 13 with the President heading up the Super Congress is a financial dictatorship.
[01:18:16.247 --> 01:18:29.750]  They admit that the bills will now originate out of this group, and if the full House or Senate doesn't vote it up or down in a simple 51% vote, then whatever the Council has already put in place becomes law.
[01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:33.651]  This is so authoritarian, it is beyond textbook.
[01:18:33.651 --> 01:18:35.492]  It is so naked and brazen.
[01:18:36.332 --> 01:18:39.534]  And it's happening on every front.
[01:18:39.534 --> 01:18:42.996]  But are our republics not dying with a bang?
[01:18:42.996 --> 01:18:44.817]  It's happening with a whimper.
[01:18:44.817 --> 01:18:51.800]  And if they're getting away with this, what do you expect looking into your historical crystal ball that they're going to try next?
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.141]  I mean, if they're getting away with this.
[01:18:54.571 --> 01:19:01.415]  Well, I think the thing you have to realize is this is super unconstitutional, the so-called Super Congress.
[01:19:01.415 --> 01:19:05.617]  And the real question is the challenge to the American people.
[01:19:05.617 --> 01:19:10.259]  Are there enough people out there with guts who will stand up and fight this?
[01:19:10.259 --> 01:19:13.161]  And we're seeing elements of this starting to emerge.
[01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:18.563]  We're seeing it in the African-American population with the famous video of Maxine Waters.
[01:19:18.563 --> 01:19:22.245]  Although, I don't know why you have to ask permission to negotiate with Nero.
[01:19:22.245 --> 01:19:23.086]  You've got to get rid of him.
[01:19:23.786 --> 01:19:25.669]  You see it in the Hispanic population.
[01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:27.352]  You see it with progressives.
[01:19:27.352 --> 01:19:29.014]  You see it with conservatives.
[01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:33.040]  There are very few people who are giving their consent to this government.
[01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:37.578]  But the problem is that the elected officials in the U.S.
[01:19:37.578 --> 01:19:48.226]  Congress, in the House and the Senate, in state legislatures all over the country, have been willing to cut and kill for the sake of the bailout.
[01:19:48.226 --> 01:19:53.630]  And the real issue I think we've got to face is either we stop the bailout with Glass-Steagall
[01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:55.110]  And get Obama out.
[01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.990]  Harley, stay there.
[01:19:55.990 --> 01:20:02.852]  Let's look at where the economy is going on its current course versus some of the solutions.
[01:20:02.852 --> 01:20:08.993]  From the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas.
[01:20:08.993 --> 01:20:15.735]  I brought no one with me.
[01:20:15.735 --> 01:20:19.216]  No one will be here.
[01:20:19.216 --> 01:20:20.576]  I just came to watch.
[01:20:24.952 --> 01:20:27.475]  Life Before the Collapse, final LP by The Lost Vegas.

[01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:47.083]  Harley Schlanger, historian, researcher, is our guest via video connection.
[01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:49.065]  All right, Harley, continuing.
[01:24:49.065 --> 01:24:56.514]  Where are we going if they don't bring back Glass-Steagall, if they don't write off the trillions and trillions in fraudulent
[01:24:56.994 --> 01:24:59.435]  International derivatives that we've been signed on to.
[01:24:59.435 --> 01:25:02.197]  I mean, they admit that most of our debt is not our debt.
[01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:05.299]  We've been signed on to the bankers Ponzi scheme.
[01:25:05.299 --> 01:25:07.520]  Instead, they're saying cut all the entitlements.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.861]  But I've seen the numbers.
[01:25:08.861 --> 01:25:18.326]  Even if you cut all the entitlements, took all the quote wealthy people's money who are in the US, it wouldn't pay off a fraction of the fraudulent debt.
[01:25:18.326 --> 01:25:23.048]  So it's a lie to say cut, cut, cut, and that that will get us back solvent.
[01:25:23.048 --> 01:25:25.610]  Just like it's a lie saying giving trillions to banks.
[01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:28.991]  Three years ago and now again, well, we'll get us going.
[01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:30.952]  Let me give you an example.
[01:25:30.952 --> 01:25:37.554]  The Greek government has followed an austerity regime and its GDP continues to shrink.
[01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:46.457]  When you cut into the real economy, the only way to get out of this crisis is you have to separate the illegitimate debt, which is the vast majority of the debt,
[01:25:46.997 --> 01:25:48.938]  From the real obligations of banks.
[01:25:48.938 --> 01:25:50.599]  That's what Glass-Steagall does.
[01:25:50.599 --> 01:25:54.781]  The real obligations being deposits, checking accounts, business accounts, and so on.
[01:25:54.781 --> 01:25:56.482]  You have to protect those.
[01:25:56.482 --> 01:26:07.469]  But you don't protect the worthless financial instruments that were created, beginning with mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, and so on.
[01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:17.282]  Now, just to give you an example of the actual corruption which is playing into this, there was a story in the New York Times which was like a bad mafia movie.
[01:26:17.282 --> 01:26:22.790]  Two administration officials, Sean Donovan of HUD and Catherine Wilde of the New York Federal Reserve,
[01:26:23.391 --> 01:26:23.931]  We're good to go.
[01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:59.576]  The administration, Obama, acting through these two surrogates, tried to deliver a message to the Attorney General of New York, that you will not go after the Bank of America, and Wilde actually said, Wall Street is our Main Street.
[01:26:59.576 --> 01:27:05.001]  Now that's how the people who are running this country, running Obama, actually think about it.
[01:27:05.001 --> 01:27:07.523]  Forget Main Street, they're going to defend Wall Street.
[01:27:08.183 --> 01:27:14.006]  Now, if there is a strategy, and LaRouche says, look, these guys are crazy.
[01:27:14.006 --> 01:27:19.448]  Their main strategy is genocide, destroy the nation-state, and kill the population.
[01:27:19.448 --> 01:27:24.090]  But if there is a strategy, they actually think that if they hyperinflate,
[01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:41.329]  The banks can pay off some of this debt with cheap money, but what that will mean is that will wipe out what's left of anybody's savings and pensions in a Weimar-style hyperinflation, which is what Bernanke and Geithner and Obama are going towards.
[01:27:41.329 --> 01:27:44.092]  Once that is done, the dollar is worthless.
[01:27:44.893 --> 01:27:51.666]  And so if we don't get Glass-Steagall, and if we don't get back to the protection of our Constitution, we have nothing.
[01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:56.055]  The people of this country will have lost everything, including our ability to fight.
[01:27:56.792 --> 01:28:09.661]  Now, Harley, I want you to continue along that line, but when you say they want a debt economy, they want to reduce population, I want to get into the globeless mindset from your research when we come back.
[01:28:09.661 --> 01:28:10.962]  You're not just saying that.
[01:28:10.962 --> 01:28:23.490]  They have created a cosmology, a post-industrial one-child policy to basically rationalize their command and control
[01:28:24.531 --> 01:28:27.212]  It's the empire killing off the nation-state.
[01:28:51.343 --> 01:28:53.044]  All right, well, and they say it.
[01:28:53.044 --> 01:28:54.225]  We're not making this up.
[01:28:54.225 --> 01:29:00.830]  I mean, Prince Philip, who many people think is a doddering old fool, which he is, but he's an old Nazi.
[01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:10.998]  The Bush family, the Harriman family, some of these leading families of Great Britain who run these international banking cartels, they helped put Hitler in power.
[01:29:10.998 --> 01:29:12.539]  This is not something that's made up.
[01:29:12.539 --> 01:29:13.840]  This is historical fact.
[01:29:14.673 --> 01:29:17.996]  They believe that there are too many people on the planet.
[01:29:17.996 --> 01:29:23.320]  They promote these fraudulent scientists who come out and talk about the carrying capacity.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:30.746]  They talk about the second law of thermodynamics, that we cannot expand production to take care of a growing population.
[01:29:30.746 --> 01:29:35.870]  And meanwhile, they impose policies that are leading to starvation, unnecessary starvation.
[01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.091]  Harley Schlanger, stay there.
[01:29:37.091 --> 01:29:38.832]  Let's finish up with that when we come back.
[01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:39.593]  Get more into where
[01:29:40.273 --> 01:29:45.099]  The economy's going in your trend forecasting on the other side.
[01:29:45.099 --> 01:29:45.860]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.063]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.063 --> 01:29:51.066]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:51.066 --> 01:29:52.467]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.467 --> 01:29:54.990]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:57.673]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.645 --> 01:30:06.588]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.588 --> 01:30:15.455]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.455 --> 01:30:20.079]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.079 --> 01:30:30.908]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.528 --> 01:30:41.031]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:41.031 --> 01:30:46.473]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.473 --> 01:30:53.956]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:53.956 --> 01:30:56.717]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:31:00.623 --> 01:31:01.804]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:01.804 --> 01:31:08.729]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:11.290]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:16.674]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.674 --> 01:31:19.716]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.716 --> 01:31:22.037]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:22.037 --> 01:31:28.282]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:28.722]  In fact,
[01:31:28.982 --> 01:31:31.643]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.643 --> 01:31:39.064]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:39.064 --> 01:31:40.364]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.364 --> 01:31:43.045]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:43.045 --> 01:31:47.266]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.266 --> 01:31:51.887]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:31:51.887 --> 01:31:54.487]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:31:54.487 --> 01:31:57.508]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:31:58.328 --> 01:32:00.410]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:03.933]  Hi folks, Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.
[01:32:03.933 --> 01:32:09.237]  In August, we're celebrating our 30-year anniversary in the long-term food supply industry.
[01:32:09.237 --> 01:32:14.501]  To celebrate, the biggest sale ever, our most popular premier one-year food supply for 30% off.
[01:32:15.942 --> 01:32:19.164]  That's 30% off of our Freedom Food Supply.
[01:32:19.164 --> 01:32:23.246]  You save $536 on each one-year supply.
[01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:26.527]  That's lower than 1981 prices.
[01:32:26.527 --> 01:32:30.389]  If you ever thought about getting a year's supply of food, now is the time.
[01:32:30.389 --> 01:32:35.852]  This whole one-year supply is a balanced selection of foods and it all fits in the space of a washing machine.
[01:32:36.172 --> 01:32:38.254]  You know you need your own food.
[01:32:38.254 --> 01:32:39.836]  But time is running out.
[01:32:39.836 --> 01:32:44.941]  This 30% off sale for the best food on the planet ends Friday, August 26th.
[01:32:44.941 --> 01:32:46.342]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:32:46.342 --> 01:32:47.823]  This sale ends Friday, August 26th.
[01:32:47.823 --> 01:32:50.726]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:33:07.783 --> 01:33:34.657]  You see, folks, people have to get their mind around the fact that the social engineers of our planet, just like Joe Biden was just praising the one-child policy in China, they believe in a economy that destroys, that feeds, that for somebody to win, somebody's got to lose.
[01:33:36.223 --> 01:33:41.084]  And this is the economy they're selling with the death panels, which they now admit are real.
[01:33:41.084 --> 01:33:45.205]  And Bill Gates says, kill granny, we get to hire 10 teachers.
[01:33:45.205 --> 01:33:48.185]  And they're selling the public on this idea.
[01:33:48.185 --> 01:33:56.447]  The Soviets did that, the Nazis did this, the Empire sell this idea, and it's their ruthless rationale.
[01:33:56.447 --> 01:34:03.488]  And you've seen how, as soon as we bought into this globalist system, all the prosperity, all the security went out the window.
[01:34:04.912 --> 01:34:09.757]  So we're going to be talking to our guest more, Harley Schlanger, here in just a moment.
[01:34:09.757 --> 01:34:15.323]  I want to remind listeners, with this radio broadcast, is listener supported.
[01:34:15.323 --> 01:34:22.491]  So when you buy a camouflage Infowars.com hat, that supports the show and spreads the word.
[01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:23.372]  When you get a t-shirt,
[01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:26.410]  With Infowars.com on it.
[01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:31.272]  It gets the word out, you meet like-minded people, and it supports the broadcast.
[01:34:31.272 --> 01:34:42.374]  When you go to Infowars.com and take advantage of the deal where you can get two silver dollars, free shipping, a free book, and a free video for $88.
[01:34:42.374 --> 01:34:43.935]  Who can beat that price?
[01:34:43.935 --> 01:34:45.155]  You support the broadcast.
[01:34:45.695 --> 01:34:47.977]  Quite frankly, that one really doesn't.
[01:34:47.977 --> 01:34:54.044]  It's a loss leader, but that deal is at InfoWars.com, right-hand corner of the page.
[01:34:54.044 --> 01:34:56.726]  Buy two silver dollars, get two free gifts.
[01:34:56.726 --> 01:34:58.929]  Really, it's three free gifts because you also get the free shipping.
[01:35:01.724 --> 01:35:22.038]  And it's even more important that once you read the book or watch the videos, whether it's the Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Terror Storm, Invisible Empire, that you give the DVD to friends and family, or that you make copies of it, air it on AXS TV.
[01:35:22.038 --> 01:35:25.361]  Every little thing we do together can move mountains.
[01:35:25.361 --> 01:35:26.762]  Many hands make light work.
[01:35:27.967 --> 01:35:36.932]  So it is your support of the broadcast that also allows it to be a platform for all these other ideas and activists to come on and to educate more people.

[01:36:23.662 --> 01:36:30.653]  Now going back to historian, researcher, author, Harley Schlanger joining us via video connection from Houston.
[01:36:32.435 --> 01:36:45.599]  I was asking you to get into the social Darwinistic Malthusians that run things and where their program is going to lead us and what you are forecasting is going to happen not just in the U.S.
[01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:50.220]  but worldwide in the next year to two years if things are not reversed.
[01:36:52.148 --> 01:37:10.653]  Well, Lyndon LaRouche has a five-decade record of forecasting, and many, many years ago with the launching of the environmentalist movement on college campuses during the Vietnam War, it became clear that there was an attempt to limit and destroy populations.
[01:37:10.653 --> 01:37:14.814]  Let me just cite two examples of this that are official government policy.
[01:37:14.814 --> 01:37:19.696]  One was the National Security Study Memo 200, which was adopted by Henry Kissinger.
[01:37:20.276 --> 01:37:25.241]  Which said that population threat in the developing sector is the greatest threat to U.S.
[01:37:25.241 --> 01:37:26.922]  security, and the U.S.
[01:37:26.922 --> 01:37:35.069]  should use any means at its disposal, including food as a weapon, to reduce populations in developing sector.
[01:37:35.069 --> 01:37:36.691]  Then under Carter we had Global 2000.
[01:37:37.992 --> 01:37:39.794]  Which essentially said U.S.
[01:37:39.794 --> 01:37:41.175]  overproduction, U.S.
[01:37:41.175 --> 01:37:42.236]  technology, U.S.
[01:37:42.236 --> 01:37:47.321]  science is a problem because it engenders cultural optimism.
[01:37:47.321 --> 01:37:56.170]  And cultural optimism will lead to more people, it will lead to new scientific discoveries, and will use up the resources of the planet, and therefore we have to stop development.
[01:37:56.730 --> 01:38:00.351]  Now that's what's behind the deindustrialization policy.
[01:38:00.351 --> 01:38:08.394]  We see on economics, they've created a global economic policy of a rule by cartels.
[01:38:08.394 --> 01:38:15.597]  The empire is really a series of interlocking cartels in finance, insurance, pharmaceuticals, oil, raw materials, and so on.
[01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:22.401]  Who are there to prey upon populations, to wipe out whole sectors of the human race.
[01:38:22.401 --> 01:38:27.144]  Some of these people are on record, like you mentioned Maurice Strong, I've heard you mention him before.
[01:38:27.144 --> 01:38:32.447]  They're on record as saying the world is overpopulated when there's more than 1 billion people.
[01:38:32.447 --> 01:38:33.768]  So what do you do with 6 billion?
[01:38:34.548 --> 01:38:45.841]  What we're about to see with the hyperinflation and with the weather problems around the world, we're going to see food shortages that will take millions, hundreds of millions of lives.
[01:38:46.889 --> 01:38:55.358]  In populations that are weakened for lack of food and medication, basically bodies become petri dishes for the spawning of new diseases.
[01:38:55.358 --> 01:39:04.348]  And this is why LaRouche is saying we face a dark age, which if we don't get rid of Obama, and if we don't get back to our constitutional economic principles,
[01:39:05.029 --> 01:39:16.962]  We will be in a dark age, and I'm not talking 50, 100 years from now, I'm talking months from now, because we could have an implosion of the entire global financial system even before September.
[01:39:20.425 --> 01:39:29.993]  I mean, to interrupt just to back you up, that's what Ted Turner, that's what the U.N., that's what all of them say, that it's good to be post-industrial.
[01:39:29.993 --> 01:39:32.395]  They're selling this is a good thing.
[01:39:32.395 --> 01:39:42.462]  You go to Whole Foods, but many of the magazines for the trendies are how great austerity is, how great it is for things to fall apart, how wonderful
[01:39:43.623 --> 01:39:44.344]  All of this is.
[01:39:44.344 --> 01:39:50.329]  I mean, this is such a sickening plan to boil it down, and then I want you to continue with the collapse they're designing.
[01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:57.813]  These are Ponzi scheme operators that have created over a thousand trillion in fake derivatives.
[01:39:57.813 --> 01:40:00.334]  They have bought the world up through fraud.
[01:40:00.334 --> 01:40:08.919]  They're artificially depressing the economy to bankrupt people so that folks will not be upwardly mobile.
[01:40:08.919 --> 01:40:12.481]  I mean, this is a corporate genocide.
[01:40:12.481 --> 01:40:17.423]  If you go back to ancient cultures, they would go in and wipe out the nearby tribe.
[01:40:17.423 --> 01:40:20.805]  The corporatists have said, we've stolen the world through fraud.
[01:40:21.565 --> 01:40:37.417]  And through insider crony capitalism, the opposite of free market, we are now going to sell a religion of self-loathing and hating to turn people's own survival instinct against itself.
[01:40:37.417 --> 01:40:48.366]  I mean, this is so diabolical, and it's the British Malthusian eugenics system adopted by the US, adopted by Hitler, being implemented by stealth,
[01:40:48.866 --> 01:40:54.548]  It is so monstrous, so please continue.
[01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:56.729]  Well, what you said is absolutely right.
[01:40:56.729 --> 01:41:00.890]  This is the Hitler policy, only now it's global.
[01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:06.892]  And this is a 1930s style depression except global, and they've already used up all their bullets.
[01:41:07.779 --> 01:41:13.043]  They have created so much funny money in the last three years.
[01:41:13.043 --> 01:41:16.246]  And of course, it hasn't worked to create jobs.
[01:41:16.246 --> 01:41:19.909]  It hasn't worked to deal with the housing crisis.
[01:41:19.909 --> 01:41:22.330]  The new home sales are continuing to fall.
[01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:26.173]  More and more people are not just out of work, but we're losing skills.
[01:41:26.173 --> 01:41:28.555]  We're losing whole sections of the human race.
[01:41:28.555 --> 01:41:29.996]  But the people who believe this,
[01:41:30.777 --> 01:41:32.840]  Hate human beings.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:44.354]  They think they're entitled, as an imperial class, is entitled to the wealth, the sweat of the brow of the entire human race.
[01:41:44.354 --> 01:41:46.677]  And if there are too many humans, they've got to get rid of them.
[01:41:46.677 --> 01:41:48.819]  Cull the herd is the term they use.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:42:01.028]  So this Malthusian policy is exactly what was brought in with the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, and it's exactly what Lyndon LaRouche was saying in December of 1970, early 71.
[01:42:03.922 --> 01:42:14.109]  Now, it took a step forward with Bush following 9-11, which LaRouche had forecast was coming as a Reichstag fire excuse.
[01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:16.630]  It continued with the housing bubble.
[01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:19.272]  It's now at a point where they can't sustain it.
[01:42:19.272 --> 01:42:27.298]  But we're also seeing an explosion of wars, of starvation, of refugee camps where people are being herded to die.
[01:42:28.098 --> 01:42:34.886]  And we're also seeing in the United States, Alex, and this is important, this is why Obama is such a criminal who has to go.
[01:42:34.886 --> 01:42:40.392]  It's not that he's responsible for this, he's the president and he's carrying it out.
[01:42:40.392 --> 01:42:45.577]  But his policy is going to turn America's cities into war zones.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:53.422]  They're going to be, there's already 40%, 50% African American unemployment in major urban centers.
[01:42:53.422 --> 01:42:59.944]  This is just going to get worse if it weren't for the drug economy and the black economy that underlies it, the underground economy.
[01:42:59.944 --> 01:43:02.005]  You would already have riots and chaos.
[01:43:02.685 --> 01:43:14.189]  So what we've seen happen in the Arab Spring, which actually started, and I'm not talking about the funny business in Libya, but in Tunisia and Egypt, it started because people with college degrees couldn't get jobs.
[01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:16.010]  They couldn't afford to eat.
[01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:17.650]  It spread into Europe.
[01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:26.453]  In Europe, they're creating a hyperinflationary bubble to defend the Euro, which was originally set up precisely for this banker's dictatorship.
[01:43:26.453 --> 01:43:30.694]  And in this country, we're sitting here as Americans, angry.
[01:43:30.694 --> 01:43:31.375]  We're losing hope.
[01:43:32.435 --> 01:43:48.395]  But the only hope that remains is that the American people will take the constitutional remedy, which is called a credit policy, which is the American constitutional system, which means we have to get rid of the Federal Reserve, we have to write down this bad debt, write it off, let it sit there.
[01:43:49.196 --> 01:43:54.739]  Instead of having the people be saddled with the debt, give it back to the bankers.
[01:43:54.739 --> 01:43:58.261]  That's why LaRouche is saying Glass-Steagall is not just legislation.
[01:43:58.261 --> 01:44:00.762]  It's a principle of economy.
[01:44:00.762 --> 01:44:02.543]  And just one other point on this.
[01:44:02.543 --> 01:44:05.744]  Look, this debt ceiling debate was a complete fraud.
[01:44:05.744 --> 01:44:09.366]  The way you deal with a debt problem is you start producing.
[01:44:09.366 --> 01:44:10.967]  You put people to work.
[01:44:10.967 --> 01:44:16.590]  You differentiate between credit, which is for innovative technological development for the future,
[01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:24.115]  Versus payment on worthless pieces of paper accumulated through a casino gambling process.
[01:44:24.115 --> 01:44:27.598]  And so we have a very clear picture ahead of us.
[01:44:27.598 --> 01:44:36.525]  And I think the only question is, will the American people find the guts to throw Obama out?
[01:44:37.265 --> 01:44:52.313]  To cause their congressmen to storm town meetings, to express their discontent and their anger, and not just their anger, but become thoughtful and actually express their love of humanity by saying we're not going to put up with this anymore.
[01:44:52.313 --> 01:44:57.075]  Well, Arlie, that obviously is an imperative.
[01:44:57.075 --> 01:45:06.200]  The problem is, get rid of Obama, they're just going to end up putting in a Rick Perry who's bought and paid for by the same interest or somebody like a
[01:45:08.467 --> 01:45:09.188]  Mitt Romney.
[01:45:29.645 --> 01:45:33.408]  Eleven percent of the country thinking the government's doing the people's will.
[01:45:33.408 --> 01:45:43.057]  So certainly the public is awake that we're being basically robbed and cheated, but they're not fully awake to the details.
[01:45:43.057 --> 01:45:48.641]  So why would I mean, obviously, I'm for impeaching Obama right now for the unconstitutional power grabs.
[01:45:48.641 --> 01:45:49.662]  But what about Boehner?
[01:45:49.662 --> 01:45:50.783]  What about Reid?
[01:45:50.783 --> 01:45:55.687]  What about this political class that has put Homeland Security in place?
[01:45:56.668 --> 01:46:05.936]  Not to fight Muslim extremists, but from day one to suppress the American people if we ever tried to get control of our government again.
[01:46:05.936 --> 01:46:21.470]  Well, Alex, let me give you an example of something that happened within our lifetime, 21 years ago in Europe, where the dictatorships in Eastern Europe were overthrown by a popular uprising out of Leipzig in Germany, out of the Czech Republic and its solidarity in Poland.
[01:46:22.659 --> 01:46:39.265]  Yeah, the problem at that time was that we had George Herbert Walker Bush in the White House, and Thatcher and Mitterrand roped Bush into a scheme to suppress the potential of a German reunification with the Euro policy in the European Union.
[01:46:39.265 --> 01:46:49.008]  Now today, we're actually seeing the whole Western world, the transatlantic system, in a breakdown even worse than what happened in the Soviet sector.
[01:46:49.668 --> 01:46:57.473]  The American people have been bought off with bread and circuses, with topless bars and sports and things of that sort for a long time.
[01:46:57.473 --> 01:47:00.135]  But we're beginning to see an awakening.
[01:47:00.135 --> 01:47:09.161]  Now one of the things that LaRouche is doing, and I know he's discussed this with you on the program, is he's working on bringing into the leadership of this country a new generation.
[01:47:09.781 --> 01:47:12.283]  People who don't have a stake in the system.
[01:47:12.283 --> 01:47:20.190]  You know, the biggest problem we have is that even many of your listeners who agree with you completely, they still have a stake in the system.
[01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:25.034]  It's like they're lying in a rotting corpse and they're saying, well, I still have something going on here.
[01:47:25.034 --> 01:47:28.077]  Or someone on the sinking Titanic who's afraid to get on the right boat.
[01:47:28.077 --> 01:47:30.059]  Well, that's why they hold you hostage just to interject.
[01:47:30.439 --> 01:47:31.701]  That's how they hold you hostage.
[01:47:31.701 --> 01:47:35.624]  They devalue your pensions with currency devaluation.
[01:47:35.624 --> 01:47:39.588]  They start cutting the pensions, but you still take it because, oh, you're still getting 25%.
[01:47:39.588 --> 01:47:47.877]  It's like, well, I better stay in the game, even though they're stealing most of it from me, even though down the road they'll steal that final little piece.
[01:47:49.924 --> 01:47:52.946]  Absolutely, and hyperinflation will wipe it all out.
[01:47:52.946 --> 01:47:58.309]  But what we're looking at now is there are a lot of young people who don't have that same delusion.
[01:47:58.309 --> 01:47:59.950]  They don't believe in the system.
[01:47:59.950 --> 01:48:02.091]  They don't believe in the baby boomer generation.
[01:48:02.091 --> 01:48:07.054]  They know the boomers have this system as their only option.
[01:48:07.674 --> 01:48:16.760]  And so what LaRouche has done is put together a slate of six candidates, and I've been privileged to work with the candidates to put forward an alternative.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:28.768]  Going back to the American system, not accepting the corruption and the fraud and the lying and the killing, and actually putting forward a series of proposals which are available.
[01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:32.691]  People can go to larouchepac.com and see the videos done by the young people.
[01:48:33.271 --> 01:48:41.016]  And I'd also like to give a toll-free number if people want to call and find out what they can do to join us with people who are out to get rid of Obama.
[01:48:41.016 --> 01:48:46.140]  For example, State Senator Perry Clark of Kentucky put out a very strong statement.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.362]  He's a Democrat calling for the removal of Obama.
[01:48:49.362 --> 01:48:54.506]  Keisha Rogers, who I work with in Houston, won the Democratic primary in 2010 in the 22nd District.
[01:48:56.787 --> 01:49:00.249]  By calling for impeaching Obama to save NASA.
[01:49:00.249 --> 01:49:02.070]  So we've got a movement going.
[01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:04.172]  People can get in touch with us by calling 800-929-7566.
[01:49:04.172 --> 01:49:09.855]  This is a call to action.
[01:49:09.855 --> 01:49:11.957]  We don't have much time, so you can give us a call.
[01:49:11.957 --> 01:49:15.739]  Tell us you heard it on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:15.739 --> 01:49:16.840]  800-929-7566.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.702]  We have six candidates.
[01:49:20.702 --> 01:49:22.203]  We want to recruit more.
[01:49:22.203 --> 01:49:24.605]  We want to have candidates all over the country.
[01:49:25.205 --> 01:49:41.204]  Who are going to fight for Glass-Steagall and fight for the Constitution and not accept the lies that somehow you can cut your way, you can kill off the elderly to get back into production, or back into balance, or you can shut down industry and have a recovery.
[01:49:41.204 --> 01:49:43.586]  Obama's jobs programs, more free trade?
[01:49:44.207 --> 01:49:45.708]  Haven't we learned anything from this?
[01:50:05.785 --> 01:50:14.394]  Your writings on the ADL, because the Anti-Defamation League doesn't go after real criminals.
[01:50:14.394 --> 01:50:20.581]  What they do is slander people that are exposing the banking cartel, and I know you've researched it in depth, so I want to get your take.
[01:50:21.421 --> 01:50:22.361]  On that as well.
[01:50:22.361 --> 01:50:29.704]  Then when we start the third hour, listeners, we're going to have wide open phones on any of the news items, any of the issues we've gotten to.
[01:50:29.704 --> 01:50:35.246]  I've got some other important news we're going to be breaking down as well, and the latest on what's happening over in Libya.
[01:50:35.246 --> 01:50:36.726]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:50:36.726 --> 01:50:36.786]  800-259-9231.
[01:50:36.786 --> 01:50:37.587]  One more segment.
[01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:51.880]  with our guest and then we're going to go to your phone calls throughout the last hour.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:59.590]  Harley Schlanger is our guest, I'm Alex Jones, and this is the one, the only, GCN Radio Network, GCNlive.com.

[01:51:57.356 --> 01:51:57.636]  800-332-6784.
[01:51:57.636 --> 01:51:58.297]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:52:04.164 --> 01:52:12.849]  Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:52:12.849 --> 01:52:20.053]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[01:52:20.053 --> 01:52:30.840]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.802]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:52:34.802 --> 01:52:40.966]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:52:40.966 --> 01:52:50.853]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:52:50.853 --> 01:52:52.334]  The war is here.
[01:52:52.334 --> 01:52:54.235]  It's an info war.
[01:52:54.235 --> 01:52:56.196]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:53:00.399 --> 01:53:02.941]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:53:02.941 --> 01:53:08.244]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:53:08.244 --> 01:53:18.772]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed Zerodet100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:53:18.772 --> 01:53:20.093]  Forget loan modification.
[01:53:20.093 --> 01:53:26.257]  Zerodet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:53:26.437 --> 01:53:31.882]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt Program.
[01:53:31.882 --> 01:53:36.167]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:53:36.167 --> 01:53:44.595]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt Special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:53:44.755 --> 01:53:46.316]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:53:46.316 --> 01:53:46.396]  800-477-9256.
[01:53:46.396 --> 01:53:46.596]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:53:46.596 --> 01:53:47.377]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[01:54:15.789 --> 01:54:18.791]  And I've read many of his articles over the years.
[01:54:18.791 --> 01:54:20.692]  Their analysis is excellent.
[01:54:20.692 --> 01:54:24.614]  Of the problems, I don't know in every case, but I totally agree with their solutions.
[01:54:24.614 --> 01:54:30.938]  But in a general capacity, it's certainly a lot better than the austerity and controlled implosion we're facing.
[01:54:32.199 --> 01:54:34.882]  I've seen your writings dealing with the ADL.
[01:54:34.882 --> 01:54:40.609]  I have found the ADL has been convicted, of course, of breaking into police departments and stealing files.
[01:54:40.609 --> 01:54:41.650]  No need to do that now.
[01:54:41.650 --> 01:54:45.114]  They actually run many of the police departments now.
[01:54:45.114 --> 01:54:50.701]  From your research, why have you decided to focus in on the ADL in the past?
[01:54:53.029 --> 01:54:55.809]  Well, the ADL has been an arm of the empire.
[01:54:55.809 --> 01:55:05.271]  In fact, the origins of the Anti-Defamation League were to defend Jewish drug pushers in New York City when the New York City Police Department started going after them.
[01:55:05.271 --> 01:55:07.812]  And they said, oh, this is anti-Semitism.
[01:55:07.812 --> 01:55:20.754]  In the case of Mr. LaRouche, as he started honing in on the International Monetary Fund, the whole Carter administration commitment to Global 2000, deindustrialization, and so on, instead of taking his arguments
[01:55:21.394 --> 01:55:26.916]  And trying to refute them, what they said is, oh, he's running a Jewish banker theory.
[01:55:26.916 --> 01:55:29.677]  No, banks don't have a religion.
[01:55:29.677 --> 01:55:42.443]  And in fact, most of the people who are so-called Jewish bankers, I think sensible Judaism, to quote Yitzhak Rabin, would spit them out, would reject them, because they have nothing to do with the teachings of Moses and Judaism.
[01:55:43.203 --> 01:55:44.163]  Well, take the ADL!
[01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:04.250]  I mean, take the ADL.
[01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:17.413]  They'll defend Schwarzenegger, who admittedly is a Nazi, and tells everybody how much he loves Hitler, and tells Rolling Stone that, and I never get into racial issues or religious issues, and they're always trying to imply I'm racist.
[01:56:17.413 --> 01:56:20.853]  I mean, it's really a despicable organization.
[01:56:20.853 --> 01:56:22.314]  And, I mean, take your group.
[01:56:22.314 --> 01:56:27.095]  I mean, it's the opposite of getting into racial issues, and I know they've attacked you guys.
[01:56:27.095 --> 01:56:27.995]  I mean, it really is a joke.
[01:56:29.875 --> 01:56:34.177]  That anybody who stands up for sovereignty is attacked by the ADL.
[01:56:34.177 --> 01:56:36.017]  We're going to have to have you back soon.
[01:56:36.017 --> 01:56:39.039]  There's been a... It says headline, Fox News.
[01:56:39.039 --> 01:56:40.279]  We'll put it back on screen.
[01:56:40.279 --> 01:56:43.920]  Unconfirmed earthquake hits DC.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:47.362]  Capitol being evacuated right now.
[01:56:47.362 --> 01:56:49.462]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:56:49.462 --> 01:56:51.503]  Man, is this harp at work?
[01:56:51.503 --> 01:56:53.824]  What's your take on that, Harley?
[01:56:55.626 --> 01:57:03.212]  Well, I think if you go to our website, you'll see that we have a lot of material about where the solar system is in the galaxy.
[01:57:03.212 --> 01:57:23.067]  The solar system goes through cycles and changes, and every 62 million years or so, we come into an area of the galaxy where we begin to see very significant changes in the Earth's electromagnetic core, in the ionosphere, and what we're seeing with solar flares and things of that sort, when a very dangerous moment
[01:57:23.727 --> 01:57:26.430]  Yeah, they cut a satellite that watches the sun.
[01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:28.672]  They cut a satellite that watches the sun.
[01:57:40.066 --> 01:57:47.073]  Yeah, a number of them, and this is the only way we can develop a capability of looking for precursors to protect people.
[01:57:47.073 --> 01:57:53.500]  So, I think again on this case, and by the way, notice how often Obama says, well we can't do anything about earthquakes.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:56.043]  Well maybe we could if we didn't have a treasonous president.
[01:57:57.065 --> 01:58:00.267]  So people, again, can go to our website.
[01:58:00.267 --> 01:58:05.690]  If I can give the 800 number again, 800-929-7566.
[01:58:05.690 --> 01:58:09.011]  We're serious about getting rid of Obama now.
[01:58:09.011 --> 01:58:16.215]  We're talking with people all over the country, in various institutions, in parties.
[01:58:16.215 --> 01:58:19.076]  There are a lot of people who want him gone, but say he can't do anything.
[01:58:19.076 --> 01:58:20.517]  Well, why not?
[01:58:20.517 --> 01:58:21.458]  All right, Harley.
[01:58:21.458 --> 01:58:23.859]  The 25th Amendment gives us the capability to do that.
[01:58:24.079 --> 01:58:24.239]  Sure.
[01:58:24.239 --> 01:58:25.000]  Harley, we're out of time.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.381]  We'll talk to you again in the future.
[01:58:26.381 --> 01:58:27.982]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:27.982 --> 01:58:33.946]  We'll try to figure out what's going on with this unconfirmed earthquake evacuation of the White House.
[01:58:33.946 --> 01:58:34.987]  Excuse me, of the Capitol.
[01:58:34.987 --> 01:58:37.109]  This is getting weirder by the minute.
[01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:38.670]  And your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:42.512]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.512 --> 01:58:46.015]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.015 --> 01:58:47.576]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.865 --> 01:58:55.408]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.408 --> 01:58:56.328]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.328 --> 01:58:59.751]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.751 --> 01:59:00.611]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.611 --> 01:59:05.514]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.514 --> 01:59:06.255]  It's true.
[01:59:06.255 --> 01:59:11.118]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.118 --> 01:59:11.958]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.958 --> 01:59:15.541]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.541 --> 01:59:19.223]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.443 --> 01:59:20.223]  Number four.
[01:59:20.223 --> 01:59:22.984]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.984 --> 01:59:26.666]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.666 --> 01:59:27.466]  Number five.
[01:59:27.466 --> 01:59:31.608]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.608 --> 01:59:36.670]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:40.831]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.831 --> 01:59:42.612]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.612 --> 01:59:47.234]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:47.534 --> 01:59:48.475]  877-327-0365 Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.475 --> 01:59:49.677]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.612 --> 02:00:10.436]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:12.038]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.579]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.579 --> 02:00:17.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.783 --> 02:00:21.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.607 --> 02:00:34.068]  Okay, we've got a lot of contacts in D.C.
[02:00:34.068 --> 02:00:36.248]  and they're on the Maryland border of D.C.
[02:00:36.248 --> 02:00:37.868]  Webster Tarpley's one of them.
[02:00:37.868 --> 02:00:38.869]  We just called him.
[02:00:38.869 --> 02:00:41.569]  He did feel and see the earthquake.
[02:00:41.569 --> 02:00:43.890]  So he'll be popping in briefly in the next segment.
[02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:46.010]  A quote, unconfirmed earthquake.
[02:00:46.010 --> 02:00:49.971]  But we've confirmed that buildings were shaking and things were going on.
[02:00:49.971 --> 02:00:53.212]  It made Tarpley run to the window and he's in Maryland right on the D.C.
[02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:54.552]  border.
[02:00:54.552 --> 02:00:57.113]  So they're evacuating the Capitol.
[02:00:57.113 --> 02:00:58.693]  It's just stuff gets weirder by the minute.
[02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:02.313]  Let's go to Wendy in Hawaii.
[02:01:02.313 --> 02:01:03.974]  Wendy, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:01:03.974 --> 02:01:07.796]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:01:07.796 --> 02:01:26.865]  I hope you didn't talk about this yet because I just tuned in, but following RT.com to get the news about Libya, I was wondering if you were aware of the statement that they said that the Rio R-I-X Hotel was split in two
[02:01:27.526 --> 02:01:35.171]  Between independent journalists and supposedly CNN journalists who were known CIA agents?
[02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:40.435]  Well, CNN admits that there's a Washington Post article that it's completely Pentagon-run.
[02:01:40.435 --> 02:01:44.437]  Anderson Cooper's admittedly CIA, out of college.
[02:01:44.437 --> 02:01:54.144]  I mean, pretty much the entire crew, Wolf Blitzer's an Israeli agent and publicly worked for the Israeli government and AIPAC.
[02:01:54.144 --> 02:01:55.285]  I mean, the whole thing's a joke.
[02:01:57.006 --> 02:02:01.328]  Most of our tax money goes to openly fund CNN, MSNBC.
[02:02:01.328 --> 02:02:04.630]  They're government-slash-foreign-banking-system-run.
[02:02:04.630 --> 02:02:07.451]  These are collaborator media.
[02:02:07.451 --> 02:02:10.533]  And they give you a fake choice with Fox News.
[02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:12.814]  And it's riddled and filled with government operatives.
[02:02:12.814 --> 02:02:13.895]  That's come out in England.
[02:02:14.850 --> 02:02:16.712]  So yes, of course.
[02:02:16.712 --> 02:02:22.659]  They've had CNN reporters and others come right up to independent journalists and say, you know what, you're dead, buddy.
[02:02:22.659 --> 02:02:26.604]  And then they go outside and somebody snipers them.
[02:02:26.604 --> 02:02:30.668]  Probably hotel journalists going over and getting in their commando outfit across the street.
[02:02:30.668 --> 02:02:32.510]  Most of these people are special ops killers.
[02:02:33.371 --> 02:02:35.011]  And they run America for the banks.
[02:02:35.011 --> 02:02:35.752]  They're hardcore.
[02:02:35.752 --> 02:02:37.212]  That's why they rule us.
[02:02:37.212 --> 02:02:39.013]  People aren't playing games.
[02:02:39.013 --> 02:02:41.953]  And they want to start assassinations in America against the media.
[02:02:41.953 --> 02:02:43.614]  That's why they've announced that they'll kill U.S.
[02:02:43.614 --> 02:02:49.315]  citizens now for national security outside of courts or jurisdiction or anything else.
[02:02:49.315 --> 02:02:51.616]  Ron Paul warned about that in the debate two weeks ago.
[02:02:51.616 --> 02:02:56.177]  I mean, this country's run by hardcore foreign bankers.
[02:02:56.177 --> 02:02:59.958]  So that makes sense that the journalists were calling in and telling
[02:03:00.811 --> 02:03:04.497]  NATO where the checkpoints were and that's how they made the siege.
[02:03:04.497 --> 02:03:09.405]  They called in and had NATO bomb the checkpoints and that's how the rebels got in.
[02:03:09.405 --> 02:03:10.146]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:03:10.146 --> 02:03:12.890]  I mean that's the oldest trick in the book.
[02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:13.731]  To have journalists...
[02:03:15.397 --> 02:03:15.977]  I don't know.
[02:03:32.023 --> 02:03:37.086]  Most my family that's been in the army has been approached by the CIA to join them.
[02:03:37.086 --> 02:03:39.487]  And it's not like, ooh, we got approached by the CIA.
[02:03:39.487 --> 02:03:43.069]  It's like, you know, you're being approached to sell crack on the street corner.
[02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:56.055]  I mean, I've had family who were army officers who actually took the offer up and got into the quote CIA training and it was dealing drugs and, you know, orders to kill people in Chicago.
[02:03:56.055 --> 02:03:59.937]  And they said, no, I mean, that's who runs America's foreign banks.
[02:03:59.937 --> 02:04:00.678]  One hundred percent.
[02:04:01.687 --> 02:04:03.469]  And they do whatever they want.
[02:04:03.469 --> 02:04:13.277]  And of course, CNN and MSNBC are, a lot of those people you see on the news, the ugly anchors, those people aren't just spies.
[02:04:13.277 --> 02:04:14.398]  They're a lot more than that.
[02:04:14.398 --> 02:04:19.683]  I mean, these are hardcore people who've made their bones in different continents all over the world.
[02:04:19.683 --> 02:04:21.905]  They're here to make sure America goes down.
[02:04:21.905 --> 02:04:26.148]  They're here to make sure that the Republic and all of the Bill of Rights is overthrown.
[02:04:27.125 --> 02:04:29.051]  And they are enemies of the Republic.
[02:04:29.051 --> 02:04:32.803]  The CIA was set up by the private banking families in 1947.
[02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:37.662]  And they control the narcotics, they control it all.
[02:04:37.662 --> 02:04:43.344]  And bringing this country down is their number one goal, while wrapping themselves in the American flag all day.
[02:04:43.344 --> 02:04:44.684]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:04:44.684 --> 02:04:47.265]  Stay with us on the other side.
[02:04:47.265 --> 02:04:50.566]  The transmission will continue.
[02:04:50.566 --> 02:04:54.827]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:54.827 --> 02:04:57.208]  Yeah, they know I'm fearless, they know I'm committed.
[02:04:57.208 --> 02:04:59.129]  People can't believe this show's so hardcore.
[02:05:01.997 --> 02:05:03.699]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.699 --> 02:05:09.004]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:09.004 --> 02:05:10.546]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:10.546 --> 02:05:19.334]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:20.055 --> 02:05:27.600]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:35.605]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.605 --> 02:05:40.828]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:06:03.715 --> 02:06:04.716]  Police action!
[02:06:04.716 --> 02:06:05.976]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:05.976 --> 02:06:09.619]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.619 --> 02:06:12.140]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:18.024]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.024 --> 02:06:24.248]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.668 --> 02:06:30.650]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.650 --> 02:06:34.831]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.831 --> 02:06:39.112]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.112 --> 02:06:45.054]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.054 --> 02:06:48.615]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.615 --> 02:06:50.596]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.596 --> 02:06:51.036]  It's here.

[02:07:47.865 --> 02:07:50.766]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:08:01.431 --> 02:08:04.202]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.202 --> 02:08:06.993]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.906 --> 02:08:18.127]  Okay, the U.S.
[02:08:18.127 --> 02:08:33.336]  Geological Survey, we were able to get on their website a few minutes ago, it's basically down right now from traffic, is confirming a 5.8 earthquake, that's very substantial, hit Virginia and shook buildings in D.C.
[02:08:35.004 --> 02:08:38.567]  And Webster Tarpley lives right on the Maryland D.C.
[02:08:38.567 --> 02:08:44.672]  border, and so he was able to see it out the window, a frequent InfoWars contributor.
[02:08:44.672 --> 02:08:52.818]  He was obviously on for about 15 minutes with us in the first hour on the Libya globalist-induced civil war.
[02:08:52.818 --> 02:08:55.581]  Webster, can you tell us what you witnessed there in D.C.? ?
[02:08:56.673 --> 02:09:04.823]  Well, again, this is the Brockville to Gaithersburg area of Maryland, so a little bit north of the district line.
[02:09:04.823 --> 02:09:09.929]  I would say, what, 10 or 15 minutes ago, I became aware that the windows were rattling.
[02:09:09.929 --> 02:09:11.531]  The windows were shaking and rattling.
[02:09:14.173 --> 02:09:22.435]  First of all, I thought it was something, we have these airplanes that sometimes fly very low over the house, and sometimes that manages to shake the windows.
[02:09:22.435 --> 02:09:25.336]  But then I realized it was rather more serious than that.
[02:09:25.336 --> 02:09:31.557]  My wife was upstairs, and apparently the shaking on the upper floor was much more severe than it was down here.
[02:09:31.557 --> 02:09:35.858]  And then this was over, I would say, in about a minute.
[02:09:37.078 --> 02:09:40.640]  There is a seismic zone here north of Washington.
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:54.384]  Last year, actually, on August 16th, we had a 3.6 on the Richter scale earthquake here, with the epicenter being in Gaithersburg, and that was also about three miles deep.
[02:09:54.384 --> 02:09:59.626]  Well, just to be clear, though, buildings were shaken in Maryland.
[02:10:02.027 --> 02:10:05.249]  There's no reports of injuries or anything right now, thank God.
[02:10:05.249 --> 02:10:07.891]  But we're all tracking it right now.
[02:10:07.891 --> 02:10:19.038]  But what do you make of people that are saying that the orientation of the sun, the sun's activity, is driving this increased seismic activity?
[02:10:19.038 --> 02:10:22.460]  And the question is, if we pay Al Gore money, can he stop it?
[02:10:24.447 --> 02:10:26.628]  I don't know whether this can be politicized.
[02:10:26.628 --> 02:10:29.009]  Again, we had an earthquake last year here.
[02:10:29.009 --> 02:10:36.331]  The Richter scale is logarithmic, so if you go from 3.6 to 5.8, that's 100 times bigger.
[02:10:36.331 --> 02:10:39.432]  This one seems to have been in central Virginia, I would say.
[02:10:39.432 --> 02:10:44.073]  It looks like about 30 miles west of Richmond, so right in the center of Virginia.
[02:10:44.073 --> 02:10:46.614]  That means it's 150 miles away from here.
[02:10:46.614 --> 02:10:49.595]  The local television here says that the Pentagon was evacuated.
[02:10:50.215 --> 02:10:54.017]  For a while and maybe also other other government offices.
[02:10:54.017 --> 02:11:04.680]  Earthquakes occur and naturally in a time like this of crisis, they're going to be politicized and there may be some some truth to that.
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:08.662]  Naturally, we can forget about Al Gore.
[02:11:08.662 --> 02:11:13.263]  The recent case that I think we can point to is concerning that tsunami in Japan.
[02:11:13.263 --> 02:11:14.484]  There was a widespread
[02:11:15.364 --> 02:11:23.846]  Awareness, or there was a widespread belief, let me put it this way, that this, according to some sources, that U.S.
[02:11:23.846 --> 02:11:39.389]  intelligence, using this HAARP system, H-A-A-R-P, had somehow manufactured an earthquake in the Pacific Ocean, and that this has hit Japan, and that the political focus of that was to prevent Japan from breaking all ties with the U.S.
[02:11:39.389 --> 02:11:41.410]  and entering into a close strategic alliance
[02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:42.611]  We're good to go.
[02:12:04.361 --> 02:12:05.222]  All right, Webster.
[02:12:05.222 --> 02:12:23.535]  Well, we know that Secretary of Defense William Cohen, in the April 27th issue of the Army Times, they reported on a press conference, and pull the quote up, and he said, governments are working on, have developed, we know there's treaties with the UN, what, in the 77, to not have atmospheric manipulation and tectonic weapons.
[02:12:23.535 --> 02:12:30.581]  So reportedly, just like you can hit the side of a metal barn with a certain harmonics, and it can make the barn shake apart,
[02:12:31.721 --> 02:12:38.487]  Or just like a certain note can be hit by an opera singer and it can shatter crystal.
[02:12:38.487 --> 02:12:40.468]  I've actually seen it done.
[02:12:40.468 --> 02:12:44.772]  One time there was an opera singer at a dinner party in college and they got a glass out and shattered it.
[02:12:44.772 --> 02:12:55.600]  It's powerful that basically using this atmospheric manipulation, and that's what the patents from Eastman and others say in the 50s, that they can cause earthquakes on fault lines.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.061]  I also found her Ritz articles.
[02:12:57.802 --> 02:13:04.705]  Where the Israelis, in the last five years, are testing high explosive charges.
[02:13:04.705 --> 02:13:11.588]  Basically, they drill and then they pump plastic explosive down several thousand feet, liquid plastic explosive.
[02:13:11.588 --> 02:13:15.710]  It hardens and they detonate it, and they've been causing little earthquakes, they've been testing.
[02:13:15.710 --> 02:13:18.331]  So, we know seismic weaponry is being tested.
[02:13:18.331 --> 02:13:20.992]  Certainly.
[02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:22.893]  But, long before this stuff existed,
[02:13:23.453 --> 02:13:34.639]  We know that, what, just 150 years ago or so, the Mississippi changed its course when a very powerful earthquake that knocked down buildings hit.
[02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:36.861]  And so we know this happens naturally.
[02:13:36.861 --> 02:13:39.903]  There's three extinct volcanoes in Austin.
[02:13:39.903 --> 02:13:47.567]  They built a nuclear plant that no one seems to know about up off of in North Austin at the J.J.
[02:13:47.567 --> 02:13:48.688]  Pickles Center.
[02:13:48.688 --> 02:13:50.669]  It's built directly on the fault line.
[02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:54.111]  On the hillside from the Balcones Fault.
[02:14:22.330 --> 02:14:31.162]  5.8 is a prelude though to something even bigger Webster, so I hope you don't get hit by... How big was the one that hit Japan?
[02:14:31.162 --> 02:14:35.968]  This was in the upper 8's to the 9's I think.
[02:14:35.968 --> 02:14:37.009]  I think they said 9.0 or even 9.1.
[02:14:40.939 --> 02:14:47.423]  Let's hope you don't get hit by that, because, I mean, let's hope Godzilla doesn't come out of the sea and attack the Capitol.
[02:14:47.423 --> 02:14:55.088]  Well, you know, I think what you're saying about the earthquake, the seismic warfare is much more realistic than the Crab Nebula.
[02:14:55.088 --> 02:15:03.553]  I'm not that worried about the Crab Nebula, but on the other hand, this kind of an event does occur from time to time, although this intensity is rare.
[02:15:04.554 --> 02:15:09.238]  By the way, I don't want to get a fracas going here, because I just have different groups on with different perspectives.
[02:15:09.238 --> 02:15:15.683]  You know, I don't agree with all of your political views, and I certainly don't with LaRouche, but we have had those guys on from time to time.
[02:15:15.683 --> 02:15:17.705]  You know, you are a chip off the old block.
[02:15:17.705 --> 02:15:26.673]  I mean, you headed up their whole European division for a long time, but since you bring up Lenin and LaRouche, and them saying we're going through this galactic whatever,
[02:15:27.293 --> 02:15:36.183]  I get probably 500 emails a day saying why aren't I talking about Comet Beeble Bob or whatever it is supposedly coming near us in October.
[02:15:36.183 --> 02:15:43.791]  There's always every six months some new planet, some new thing that's going to kill us and I'm always a government agent because I don't cover it.
[02:15:46.594 --> 02:15:51.536]  And I'll be discredited in October when the comet doesn't kill us.
[02:15:51.536 --> 02:15:53.037]  And I don't understand how that works.
[02:15:53.037 --> 02:15:59.020]  There'll be a new asteroid, or new comet, or new Kuiper belt body after this.
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:00.840]  And I just, I'm getting really tired of it.
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:04.142]  I'm not saying that there aren't dangers of asteroids hitting us.
[02:16:04.142 --> 02:16:11.525]  It's just that to sit there and predict, because a comet's going between us and the sun, that we're all dead, or that this is what's causing earthquakes.
[02:16:11.525 --> 02:16:15.607]  I mean, it's the sun that's really driving most of this tectonic activity, not
[02:16:16.047 --> 02:16:18.469]  Not the Easter Bunny comment.
[02:16:18.469 --> 02:16:20.011]  I think that's correct.
[02:16:20.011 --> 02:16:21.392]  I would say the following.
[02:16:21.392 --> 02:16:28.238]  When you see these natural disasters, what you realize is that just-in-time inventory does not work.
[02:16:28.238 --> 02:16:30.740]  A society has got to have reserves.
[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:31.981]  It has to have stocks.
[02:16:31.981 --> 02:16:33.563]  It has to have emergency equipment.
[02:16:33.983 --> 02:16:37.325]  Generally speaking, the private sector cannot do these things.
[02:16:37.325 --> 02:16:40.646]  The free market will never do it, because they don't make profits.
[02:16:40.646 --> 02:16:42.547]  They're a losing proposition.
[02:16:42.547 --> 02:16:48.950]  On the other hand, when the natural disaster occurs, you must have your stocks, you must have your reserves.
[02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:56.654]  One of the things you see with the collapse of civilizations in the past is if the society cannot generate a sufficient social surplus,
[02:16:57.134 --> 02:17:01.918]  To be able to deal with these inevitable things when they happen, because they always do.
[02:17:01.918 --> 02:17:05.041]  That's just the nature of the physical universe, the way we see it.
[02:17:05.041 --> 02:17:12.647]  If you don't have a sufficient social surplus to be able to deal with it, then the society can collapse.
[02:17:12.647 --> 02:17:19.813]  And this is why this just-in-time inventory, you know, everything calculated down to the last second doesn't work.
[02:17:19.813 --> 02:17:20.914]  Concerning LaRouche...
[02:17:21.715 --> 02:17:25.879]  The globalists admit they want us on this economy so they control us.
[02:17:25.879 --> 02:17:33.407]  They're busy putting back giant stocks of weapons, medicines, foods, even the big corporations do for themselves.
[02:17:33.407 --> 02:17:36.350]  They teach us it's weird, it's bad.
[02:17:36.350 --> 02:17:46.520]  Maybe you should be SWAT teamed for having reserves while they're hoarding the reserves themselves because they want you absolutely dependent on the system.
[02:17:47.168 --> 02:18:00.734]  Yes, and I'm in favor of decentralized, but government-controlled dumps of all kinds of stuff that would be available in emergencies, but not for purposes of political purposes.
[02:18:00.734 --> 02:18:05.496]  Well, if you don't have that and there's an emergency, then the looting gets out of hand, which is exactly what FEMA likes.
[02:18:05.496 --> 02:18:13.060]  That's why they ordered the police to stand down in Katrina and didn't bring food for six days, and shot families trying to get out while the cops were looting everything.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.862]  And came and confiscated the firearms.
[02:18:15.862 --> 02:18:20.305]  Well, Webster, we'll continue to track the latest news there with the earthquake.
[02:18:20.305 --> 02:18:24.929]  So your house moved a bit, the windows were moving, and you say... I checked the house, though.
[02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:29.333]  I went from top to bottom and there were no significant cracks in the plaster or anything.
[02:18:29.333 --> 02:18:30.894]  It was not anything of that intensity.
[02:18:30.894 --> 02:18:33.216]  Yeah, because you're far away from it, but I'm saying you did have movement.
[02:18:33.456 --> 02:18:35.558]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:35.558 --> 02:18:36.760]  You could feel the ground shaking.
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:38.722]  I said, what kind of an airplane is this?
[02:18:38.722 --> 02:18:42.065]  This must be a 747 flying right over the house.
[02:18:42.065 --> 02:18:46.010]  We're a little bit away from something called Montgomery Air Park.
[02:18:46.010 --> 02:18:49.193]  I was giving you the opportunity to say things about LaRouge if you want to.
[02:18:49.193 --> 02:18:50.575]  I mean, you can say whatever you want, Webster.
[02:18:54.118 --> 02:19:13.242]  The tendency of world public opinion, or at least of certain parts of it, sort of the anti-establishment current, after that Japanese tsunami, was to begin to examine the question, is there this HAARP, the HAARP system, based in Alaska, is there seismic warfare, is the U.S.
[02:19:13.242 --> 02:19:20.724]  doing this, is this something that was used against Japan to stop them from making a geopolitical move
[02:19:21.204 --> 02:19:26.747]  Of the first magnitude, and you have to take that part seriously, because this is exactly what's going on in the world.
[02:19:26.747 --> 02:19:37.253]  And at this point, when world public opinion is beginning to entertain the possibility that this might have been some kind of a deliberate operation, again, I can't comment on the merits of that.
[02:19:37.253 --> 02:19:40.975]  On the world public opinion, though, yeah, that was for real.
[02:19:40.975 --> 02:19:45.878]  Here we have old LaRouche coming forward and saying, no, not the CIA, not the CIA.
[02:19:45.878 --> 02:19:49.840]  The Crab Nebula and the 62 million year cycle is responsible.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.481]  Stop talking bad about the Crab Nebula now.
[02:19:52.481 --> 02:19:56.324]  Thank you Webster.
[02:19:56.324 --> 02:19:58.065]  We'll be right back with phone calls.

[02:22:59.790 --> 02:23:06.173]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[02:23:06.173 --> 02:23:07.194]  That's easy, Bill.
[02:23:07.194 --> 02:23:11.316]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:12.837]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?

[02:23:25.604 --> 02:23:27.465]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[02:23:27.725 --> 02:23:28.746]  Absolutely, Bill.
[02:23:28.746 --> 02:23:40.176]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[02:23:40.176 --> 02:23:42.318]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[02:23:42.318 --> 02:23:43.179]  No way, Bill.
[02:23:43.179 --> 02:23:45.861]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[02:23:45.861 --> 02:23:46.322]  These are the
[02:23:46.602 --> 02:23:47.123]  Absolutely.
[02:24:06.716 --> 02:24:15.285]  Look, you can't deny that the ruling class that runs this country is trying to destroy our free market, destroy private property, destroy the family.
[02:24:15.285 --> 02:24:22.954]  And I'm tired of watching the foreign banks that run this country and the intelligence services grandstand and lecture me about patriotism.
[02:24:24.130 --> 02:24:26.092]  Now, I want to get to your phone calls.
[02:24:26.092 --> 02:24:31.557]  I know we've got a lot of folks that have been holding for a while, and I want to talk to you.
[02:24:31.557 --> 02:24:38.683]  Then I want to get to some issues of brazen corruption before this hour ends, but I'm going to go to your calls in just a moment.
[02:24:38.683 --> 02:24:46.310]  But it turns out there have been earthquakes all over the country today, and there was one today and another one yesterday in Colorado.
[02:24:47.883 --> 02:24:49.565]  A 5.3.
[02:24:49.565 --> 02:24:54.330]  Now, near Colorado, of course, is the biggest volcano in the world.
[02:24:55.649 --> 02:24:56.929]  And it's active.
[02:24:56.929 --> 02:25:04.832]  The entire of Yellowstone, the entire park is its caldera, or the opening of the volcano.
[02:25:04.832 --> 02:25:16.856]  And they report that the last time that exploded, they're not sure exactly when it exploded, but they've done the isotope checking, that it blew chunks of rock as far away as Alaska and Texas.
[02:25:16.856 --> 02:25:19.857]  Reportedly it blew more towards the northwest.
[02:25:21.436 --> 02:25:22.177]  Just like Mount St.
[02:25:22.177 --> 02:25:25.818]  Helens blew in another direction, the point is they usually explode out in one direction.
[02:25:25.818 --> 02:25:28.060]  Can you imagine?
[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:35.283]  Scientists believe it probably cooled the temperature of the Earth down many degrees for many years and probably created a mini ice age.
[02:25:35.283 --> 02:25:39.745]  We're on a planet spinning through space with giant asteroid belts around us.
[02:25:39.745 --> 02:25:42.426]  There's all sorts of Earth changes going on.
[02:25:42.426 --> 02:25:48.229]  We've seen comets smash into gas giants and blow holes in the side of them bigger than the Earth.
[02:25:49.931 --> 02:25:53.419]  I know that we get hit by asteroids and comets.
[02:25:53.419 --> 02:25:57.347]  I know it happens a lot more frequently than scientists previously believed.
[02:25:57.347 --> 02:25:58.189]  They now admit that.
[02:25:59.724 --> 02:26:13.612]  And I would be for an international effort with nations working together to put a weapons system orbiting in a deep orbit if it was all public and not secretive to defend us from these type of asteroids.
[02:26:13.612 --> 02:26:19.075]  But that's not going to happen because you know you can't trust the governments and they'd weaponize it and aim it back at the Earth.
[02:26:20.896 --> 02:26:25.278]  It's just so sad we can't work together because the globalists are such cutthroats.
[02:26:25.278 --> 02:26:26.779]  You'd know if they were good.
[02:26:26.779 --> 02:26:28.379]  They wouldn't have one-child policies.
[02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:30.200]  They wouldn't be trying to destroy the family.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:33.001]  They wouldn't be spiking the water in the food with poison.
[02:26:33.001 --> 02:26:34.882]  These are bad people.
[02:26:34.882 --> 02:26:38.784]  And we've got the worst elements running the globe right now.
[02:26:38.784 --> 02:26:40.024]  And it's disgusting.
[02:26:40.024 --> 02:26:41.605]  Got a bunch of parasites in control.
[02:26:43.479 --> 02:26:54.948]  I mean, I'll tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, if I was worth hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions like the Rothschilds, I would not be out on giant yachts every week and huge jets and private trains and 25 palaces.
[02:26:54.948 --> 02:27:00.613]  I would be trying to help humanity and build something, because I like seeing other people do well.
[02:27:00.613 --> 02:27:02.735]  I like seeing technological development.
[02:27:02.735 --> 02:27:04.736]  I believe in true progress.
[02:27:04.736 --> 02:27:07.458]  And that's what America was always into until the last 50 years.
[02:27:09.244 --> 02:27:12.225]  That's what the Renaissance, you know, 500 years old is about.
[02:27:12.225 --> 02:27:14.205]  That's normal human behavior.
[02:27:14.205 --> 02:27:23.628]  We've got these sickos in control who are trying to go back with technology and only dole out specific stuff that's used to control us.
[02:27:23.628 --> 02:27:24.709]  I don't like it.
[02:27:24.709 --> 02:27:26.389]  I know my life's transitory.
[02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:28.470]  I know my life is very, very short.
[02:27:28.470 --> 02:27:31.751]  And I am a fan of humanity.
[02:27:31.751 --> 02:27:33.631]  I want my children to have a future.
[02:27:33.631 --> 02:27:35.152]  I want their children to have a future.
[02:27:35.152 --> 02:27:35.752]  I don't like
[02:27:37.225 --> 02:27:53.874]  Seeing cancer and diabetes explode, and IQs drop, and people losing their fertility, and the system using television to completely dumb people down, and then say, look, they're a bunch of dumb animals, let's kill them.
[02:27:53.874 --> 02:27:54.975]  I mean, that is sick!
[02:27:56.243 --> 02:28:02.188]  Do you globalist engineers think this instinct to dominate and kill is going to go away once you've gotten rid of most of us?
[02:28:02.188 --> 02:28:03.489]  You're going to keep killing each other?
[02:28:03.489 --> 02:28:09.954]  If there were two globalists in some mountain fortress with all the high-tech systems, you'd try to kill each other.
[02:28:09.954 --> 02:28:12.736]  I mean, it's your nature.
[02:28:12.736 --> 02:28:17.760]  And I understand the argument, well, if we're not super evil, other people will be and they'll dominate.
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:22.924]  You know, we're being wicked because the end justifies the means because we actually are altruistic.
[02:28:22.924 --> 02:28:24.526]  Bull baloney!
[02:28:26.223 --> 02:28:26.897]  Baloney!
[02:28:29.747 --> 02:28:55.697]  You guys go after every country that tries to industrialize, every country that's truly progressive, no matter where it is, every country that tries to build a better world, you bring it down, and you're doing it to my country, and I don't like you, and I'm sick of your garbage, and I'm sick of you wrapping yourself in the American flag, and shipping your narcotics in here, and having Hollywood have all the fancy dandies, act like it's cool so young kids use it.
[02:28:55.697 --> 02:28:56.697]  They want to throw up.
[02:28:58.584 --> 02:29:00.606]  Young people, never take drugs.
[02:29:00.606 --> 02:29:02.207]  It's not cool.
[02:29:02.207 --> 02:29:05.130]  All you're doing is paying money to the banks.
[02:29:05.130 --> 02:29:06.651]  Do not use drugs.
[02:29:06.651 --> 02:29:07.792]  Ever.
[02:29:07.792 --> 02:29:10.334]  And decriminalize them.
[02:29:10.334 --> 02:29:11.936]  It's what losers do.
[02:29:11.936 --> 02:29:13.237]  It's not what winners do.
[02:29:15.213 --> 02:29:30.300]  Alright, we're going to come back and go to your calls, but a rare, strong earthquake hits Colorado today, and it goes on to say the last time it happened was a 5.3 near Denver, and 67, a magnitude 5.7 in the state's Northwest Corridor.
[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:35.763]  Both of these quakes were ultimately determined to have been caused by human activity from explosives and drilling.
[02:29:36.701 --> 02:29:38.642]  That's the New York Times.
[02:29:38.642 --> 02:29:40.542]  Oh, you can't have man-made earthquakes?
[02:29:40.542 --> 02:29:42.163]  Here they are admitting.
[02:29:42.163 --> 02:29:49.226]  Yeah, they're building big underground cities, blowing out mountains underground for all those big Adam and Eve centers.
[02:29:49.226 --> 02:29:50.006]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.006 --> 02:29:51.386]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.386 --> 02:29:52.787]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.787 --> 02:29:55.308]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.308 --> 02:29:58.009]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.581 --> 02:30:08.226]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:08.226 --> 02:30:13.389]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:22.115]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:22.115 --> 02:30:26.178]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:26.178 --> 02:30:28.420]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:30.598 --> 02:30:35.181]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:30:35.181 --> 02:30:40.264]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[02:30:40.264 --> 02:30:42.405]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:42.405 --> 02:30:44.186]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:44.186 --> 02:30:47.068]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:47.068 --> 02:30:53.692]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.692 --> 02:30:56.394]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:30:56.394 --> 02:30:59.255]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[02:31:02.102 --> 02:31:06.783]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:31:06.783 --> 02:31:13.225]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:31:13.225 --> 02:31:15.505]  Number one, study the past.
[02:31:15.505 --> 02:31:17.886]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:31:17.886 --> 02:31:21.607]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:31:22.751 --> 02:31:25.832]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:31:25.832 --> 02:31:29.673]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:31:29.673 --> 02:31:34.715]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:31:34.715 --> 02:31:38.136]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:31:38.716 --> 02:31:42.138]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:31:42.138 --> 02:31:46.641]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:46.641 --> 02:31:51.564]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:31:51.564 --> 02:31:56.187]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:56.187 --> 02:31:58.348]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:32:01.274 --> 02:32:16.747]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:16.747 --> 02:32:20.411]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:21.434 --> 02:32:34.206]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:34.206 --> 02:32:41.472]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:32:42.153 --> 02:32:52.517]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:32:52.517 --> 02:32:56.439]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:32:56.439 --> 02:32:59.560]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:33:26.010 --> 02:33:27.451]  Okay, we're going to go to your calls.
[02:33:27.451 --> 02:33:35.235]  I just want to point out again that this Comet Elenin is supposed to come here in October.
[02:33:35.235 --> 02:33:41.319]  And when nothing happens, I will be the discredited one for saying nothing is going to happen.
[02:33:41.319 --> 02:33:46.742]  In fact, let's put that article on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:33:46.742 --> 02:33:54.287]  When I see NASA saying that Comet Elenin poses no October 16th threat to Earth,
[02:33:54.907 --> 02:33:57.888]  Then I start saying, well, maybe it does pose a threat.
[02:33:57.888 --> 02:34:02.511]  But they do say it's going to pass between the Earth and the Sun.
[02:34:02.511 --> 02:34:04.532]  In fact, print me that article, because there's different...
[02:34:05.677 --> 02:34:17.800]  There's different reports on how many millions of miles it's going to be away from the Earth, but really, folks, I found that there's a fascination with things coming close to the Earth, and I understand why.
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:26.522]  We're a spaceship Earth out here, and there's all sorts of comets and asteroids and things out there, and I know we do get hit by these things, but
[02:34:27.472 --> 02:34:49.404]  Come on, I mean, every couple months there's a new asteroid, a new comment, I'm covering up, I'm going to my bunker, I know it's real, and I'm lying because I work for the Pope or whatever, or the Reptoids, and then when it doesn't kill us, see, see, it didn't kill us because Jones is a liar.
[02:34:50.598 --> 02:34:53.839]  Listen, I don't know if Elenin's going to kill us.
[02:34:53.839 --> 02:34:58.300]  But I have a lot of people calling me saying, hey, you think this is a real threat?
[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:03.682]  And I say, well, if it was a threat, the government's not going to tell us.
[02:35:03.682 --> 02:35:07.603]  But no, I think the biggest threat is that we
[02:35:09.642 --> 02:35:13.484]  Get hit by an asteroid sometime when we're not looking for it.
[02:35:13.484 --> 02:35:25.651]  And it's got the equivalent, even if it's a medium-sized one, of say 100 high-powered hydrogen bombs and throws the whole world into an ice age because it kicks up so much dust.
[02:35:25.651 --> 02:35:28.792]  I mean, I'm not saying that can't happen.
[02:35:28.792 --> 02:35:33.775]  I'm just saying this end-of-the-world apocalyptic business is a psychological
[02:35:36.988 --> 02:35:46.632]  It's a phenomenon where people are worried about their bills, worried about their kids, worried about life, and, well, Jesus is going to rapture us next month.
[02:35:46.632 --> 02:35:50.874]  You know, the such-and-such seal gets opened, my preacher said.
[02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:53.795]  Or, Jesus is going to rapture us this July.
[02:35:53.795 --> 02:35:59.797]  Or, I remember in 99, next year, Planet X is coming to kill us.
[02:35:59.797 --> 02:36:01.018]  And I said, I don't believe that.
[02:36:01.738 --> 02:36:06.621]  And I said, there's amateur astronomers, you know, that they couldn't cover this up, and I was an evil government operative.
[02:36:06.621 --> 02:36:12.885]  And then I even predicted they would say, well, actually, they got the Gregorian calendar wrong.
[02:36:12.885 --> 02:36:13.646]  In 2001, it's coming now.
[02:36:15.714 --> 02:36:17.174]  They got the calendar wrong.
[02:36:17.174 --> 02:36:20.375]  You know, the priests that studied this thousands of years ago.
[02:36:20.375 --> 02:36:22.036]  And then it didn't come in 2001.
[02:36:22.036 --> 02:36:24.156]  Well, they got the calendar wrong again!
[02:36:24.156 --> 02:36:24.936]  It's 2003!
[02:36:24.936 --> 02:36:39.900]  And then it was Nabooru, and then it was Wiggle Blackle, and then it was this Kuiper Belt thing, and this comet, and that comet, and I remember back in the late 90s, I didn't believe that there was a spaceship behind Hale-Bopp, and I was the bad guy, and...
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:41.801]  And you know what it is?
[02:36:41.801 --> 02:36:44.842]  People have to invent things that I'm bad about.
[02:36:44.842 --> 02:36:51.046]  I'm just here covering the New World Order, the poisons in the vaccines, the government shipping the drugs in.
[02:36:51.046 --> 02:36:53.868]  It isn't about who Alex Jones is.
[02:36:53.868 --> 02:36:56.970]  But instead, the whole debate becomes Alex Jones.
[02:36:56.970 --> 02:36:59.571]  And I'm just bombarded with it.
[02:36:59.571 --> 02:37:04.754]  You know, answer the question of why you're covering up for the comment.
[02:37:04.754 --> 02:37:07.476]  And I'll be the bad one when we're still there in October.
[02:37:10.709 --> 02:37:14.791]  I mean, how do I respond to that?
[02:37:14.791 --> 02:37:17.672]  Or the other garbage that's made up.
[02:37:17.672 --> 02:37:26.976]  So, again, I understand I'm visible, I'm out here talking, and the government looks like it's invincible, so it's fun to attack Alex Jones.
[02:37:26.976 --> 02:37:28.596]  Great!
[02:37:28.596 --> 02:37:33.278]  People attacking me over this comment does not upset me because I'm being attacked.
[02:37:33.278 --> 02:37:33.959]  I could care less.
[02:37:34.878 --> 02:37:35.859]  What people think about me.
[02:37:35.859 --> 02:37:37.800]  I think people have probably noticed that.
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:40.182]  In fact, in a sick way, I actually enjoy being attacked.
[02:37:40.182 --> 02:37:41.203]  The stupider, the better.
[02:37:41.203 --> 02:37:43.064]  It's a sick form of entertainment.
[02:37:43.064 --> 02:37:55.033]  But when I'm more intellectual and more spiritual about it, I think, man, that's really sad that folks are so deceived that they constantly think a comet or planet is about to kill the Earth and the same people that think this
[02:37:56.076 --> 02:37:59.920]  Never get discredited when it doesn't happen.
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:02.082]  I mean, there's always new books out.
[02:38:02.082 --> 02:38:04.485]  The same people publish books every year.
[02:38:04.485 --> 02:38:08.389]  How another planetoid is going to kill us next year.
[02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:11.012]  And they sell a bunch of books, and then it doesn't kill us.
[02:38:11.012 --> 02:38:13.434]  And they sell books again, and it doesn't kill us.
[02:38:13.434 --> 02:38:16.777]  And they sell books again, and they... I mean, I'm just like, whoa!
[02:38:18.741 --> 02:38:21.322]  I mean, all right, now I'm ranting and I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:38:21.322 --> 02:38:24.664]  I just can't, I mean, it just really worries me for people.
[02:38:24.664 --> 02:38:28.105]  It really, really worries me.
[02:38:28.105 --> 02:38:29.946]  Looking for the phone system here.
[02:38:29.946 --> 02:38:30.987]  There it is.
[02:38:30.987 --> 02:38:36.770]  Let's talk to Andrew in South Dakota, then we'll talk to Rich and others.
[02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:38.870]  Otter, gotta talk to Otter.
[02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:42.192]  Andrew in South Dakota, thank you for joining us.
[02:38:42.192 --> 02:38:43.733]  I am covering up the comet.
[02:38:43.733 --> 02:38:45.554]  We're all gonna be dead in October.
[02:38:45.554 --> 02:38:45.934]  Go ahead.
[02:38:47.486 --> 02:38:49.628]  Hey Alex, I think you're right on with all that.
[02:38:49.628 --> 02:38:52.851]  No, it's the comet that caused the earthquake!
[02:38:52.851 --> 02:38:54.432]  You're CIA as well!
[02:38:54.432 --> 02:38:58.416]  Hey, I wanted to talk to you about a couple things.
[02:38:58.416 --> 02:39:02.459]  A week, about a week and a half ago, I went to buy a handgun.
[02:39:02.459 --> 02:39:11.326]  I got a DUI like 10 years ago, but they denied me for this handgun when I called the FBI.
[02:39:11.326 --> 02:39:15.690]  They wouldn't tell me because it was a privacy issue why I got denied.
[02:39:16.542 --> 02:39:17.642]  No, no, that's right.
[02:39:17.642 --> 02:39:19.403]  So you don't have a criminal record.
[02:39:19.403 --> 02:39:20.123]  You're not a felon.
[02:39:20.123 --> 02:39:21.403]  You should be able to buy it.
[02:39:21.403 --> 02:39:24.384]  But they go, for your privacy, you're on a secret list.
[02:39:24.384 --> 02:39:27.545]  They're already putting in the no-fly, no-buy.
[02:39:27.545 --> 02:39:29.666]  They put you on the no-fly for no reason.
[02:39:29.666 --> 02:39:32.247]  No judge, no jury, no appeal.
[02:39:32.247 --> 02:39:33.907]  Just magically you can't fly.
[02:39:33.907 --> 02:39:35.908]  Well, now it's a no-buy.
[02:39:35.908 --> 02:39:39.629]  And the president's been talking about officially signing an executive order.
[02:39:40.851 --> 02:39:50.634]  Where he says you can't have a gun and next the police come and take your guns because, well, somebody said so.
[02:39:50.634 --> 02:39:51.954]  So tell us about yourself.
[02:39:51.954 --> 02:39:54.795]  I mean, do you have a record?
[02:39:54.795 --> 02:39:56.756]  No.
[02:39:56.756 --> 02:40:01.537]  In 2001 I got a DUI and that was the only thing other than a speeding ticket and whatever.
[02:40:01.537 --> 02:40:05.318]  I asked the lady at the FBI that too and she said,
[02:40:06.161 --> 02:40:14.127]  Well, I've never heard of this before, but we'll send you this appeal packet, which takes 147 days approximately.
[02:40:14.127 --> 02:40:16.049]  Yeah, you've got to go to the media.
[02:40:16.049 --> 02:40:17.310]  You ought to file a lawsuit.
[02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:19.671]  Your constitutional rights are being violated.
[02:40:19.671 --> 02:40:22.914]  You ought to go in and keep trying to buy firearms.
[02:40:22.914 --> 02:40:24.315]  I mean, don't let them stop you.
[02:40:25.856 --> 02:40:27.118]  You've got a right to own guns.
[02:40:27.118 --> 02:40:29.323]  You can go buy them at private sales.
[02:40:29.323 --> 02:40:30.926]  I mean, this is just outrageous.
[02:40:30.926 --> 02:40:33.450]  And I can't tell you how many veterans I know.
[02:40:33.450 --> 02:40:35.213]  I know a famous football player.
[02:40:35.213 --> 02:40:36.035]  No criminal record.
[02:40:36.909 --> 02:40:38.510]  He's a grandpa now.
[02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:39.732]  And he hadn't bought a gun in years.
[02:40:39.732 --> 02:40:40.552]  He went to buy one.
[02:40:40.552 --> 02:40:43.015]  Yeah, but he's a veteran as well.
[02:40:43.015 --> 02:40:46.117]  And they said, sorry, and he went through all the appeals process.
[02:40:46.117 --> 02:40:58.408]  And now they're saying that in Vietnam, now they've gone back and changed his file to say that one time when he had heat exhaustion, that that was post-traumatic stress.
[02:40:58.408 --> 02:40:59.930]  And so this is how they treat the veterans.
[02:41:02.302 --> 02:41:10.990]  Yeah, and my brother's Special Forces too, and I just... Well, he's not going to be able to own a gun once he gets out, you watch.
[02:41:10.990 --> 02:41:24.703]  He's the one who inspired me to go get guns, because he's got probably ten different rifle and handguns, and I thought, well, you know, I'd like to teach my kids, if I ever have them, how to shoot.
[02:41:24.703 --> 02:41:26.024]  Oh, that's so evil.
[02:41:26.024 --> 02:41:26.605]  That is so evil.
[02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:30.131]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:30.131 --> 02:41:33.153]  You know, that's happening to a lot of people.
[02:41:33.153 --> 02:41:42.018]  In fact, the last month of Bill Clinton's term, 87,000 veterans were told you can no longer buy guns.
[02:41:42.813 --> 02:41:46.855]  And they went into their files and changed it to post-traumatic stress.
[02:41:46.855 --> 02:41:48.396]  There's no law.
[02:41:48.396 --> 02:41:50.177]  They just said, well, we're sorry.
[02:41:50.177 --> 02:41:54.179]  See, once they get an instant check, now you're talking to an operator.
[02:41:54.179 --> 02:41:56.901]  And they're like, well, I'm sorry, Andrew.
[02:41:56.901 --> 02:41:58.582]  No gun for you.
[02:42:01.209 --> 02:42:02.750]  You show up at the airport.
[02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:05.292]  Sorry, Mr. Johnson, you're not getting on the plane.
[02:42:05.292 --> 02:42:06.373]  But why?
[02:42:06.373 --> 02:42:09.476]  Sorry, that whole trip's ruined now.
[02:42:09.476 --> 02:42:10.877]  You live in a free country.
[02:42:10.877 --> 02:42:11.717]  Bye-bye.
[02:42:11.717 --> 02:42:13.839]  But the bankers can steal trillions.
[02:42:13.839 --> 02:42:15.300]  And the government ships the drugs in.
[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:18.303]  Oh, but we're going to arrest you if you try to have a lemonade stand.
[02:42:18.303 --> 02:42:20.825]  And don't try to sell tomatoes on the side of the road either.
[02:42:20.825 --> 02:42:21.966]  And don't try to have a garden.
[02:42:22.850 --> 02:42:26.013]  And don't try to have chickens in your backyard, scum!
[02:42:26.013 --> 02:42:28.456]  Pay all the money to us!
[02:42:28.456 --> 02:42:29.997]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:42:29.997 --> 02:42:32.480]  We're your loving government!
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:35.543]  You learned how to lick boots, and now we're gonna hurt you bad!
[02:42:35.543 --> 02:42:38.426]  We're gonna see how much you'll take!
[02:42:38.426 --> 02:42:41.690]  Cause we want you to rise up, so we can then declare martial law!
[02:42:44.713 --> 02:42:46.714]  Take your fluoride, Water!
[02:42:46.714 --> 02:42:48.515]  Take your shots!
[02:42:48.515 --> 02:42:50.957]  Your child's hair's gonna fall out and they're gonna die!
[02:42:50.957 --> 02:42:52.438]  We're the government!
[02:42:52.438 --> 02:42:53.659]  I'm Rick Perry!
[02:42:53.659 --> 02:42:55.840]  Take the deadly cancer shot!
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:57.642]  Oh, yes!
[02:42:57.642 --> 02:42:59.363]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:59.363 --> 02:43:00.904]  Let's talk to Otter and Mass.
[02:43:00.904 --> 02:43:01.684]  Otter, you're on the air.
[02:43:01.684 --> 02:43:02.145]  Go ahead.
[02:43:02.145 --> 02:43:04.386]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:04.386 --> 02:43:07.909]  So, I wish I could tell you that I was hearing them taking off right now.
[02:43:07.909 --> 02:43:12.732]  About ten minutes ago, there was some of the ultrasonic vibration that we get from the helicopters.
[02:43:14.288 --> 02:43:18.511]  Several jets have blasted out of here through the no-fly zone.
[02:43:18.511 --> 02:43:20.172]  So something's going on down there.
[02:43:20.172 --> 02:43:30.499]  I imagine your people are on top of... You're talking about that no-fly corridor there in Massachusetts that goes down into Virginia, and you're saying you're hearing sonic booms right now?
[02:43:30.499 --> 02:43:32.000]  No, no, not sonic booms.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.261]  I'm on the vineyard.
[02:43:33.261 --> 02:43:36.543]  I'm next to no bomb within miles.
[02:43:37.313 --> 02:43:40.296]  And this place turns into a military camp when he's here.
[02:43:40.296 --> 02:43:43.098]  You're the gracious leader, Kim Jong-il?
[02:43:43.098 --> 02:43:46.741]  Alex, you're evil.
[02:43:46.741 --> 02:43:49.803]  You know it was the keyboard elves digging under D.C.
[02:43:49.803 --> 02:43:51.465]  that caused that thing to happen.
[02:43:51.465 --> 02:43:54.047]  Exactly, and Al-Qaeda was down there with them.
[02:43:54.047 --> 02:43:54.567]  They were.
[02:43:54.567 --> 02:43:59.931]  But you're near the one who was going to give us all free houses and gas?
[02:44:00.652 --> 02:44:00.792]  Yes.
[02:44:16.054 --> 02:44:18.275]  Listen, the globalists, they're gobblists.
[02:44:18.275 --> 02:44:22.817]  And the vampires, you talk about them, what they're afraid of is the light of day.
[02:44:22.817 --> 02:44:24.238]  They're afraid of sunlight.
[02:44:24.238 --> 02:44:26.879]  Well, if they're vampires, I'm Van Helsing.
[02:44:26.879 --> 02:44:28.240]  And let me tell you something.
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:32.742]  I have to just totally relax and not worry about anything.
[02:44:33.522 --> 02:44:36.925]  And I go jogging through the woods by myself.
[02:44:36.925 --> 02:44:39.787]  I don't worry in parking lots at night.
[02:44:39.787 --> 02:44:41.628]  I could get a concealed carry and carry a gun.
[02:44:41.628 --> 02:44:47.552]  The only time I carry a gun is if it's low-level scum, because I won't die for them.
[02:44:47.552 --> 02:44:49.874]  Then I protect myself from low-level scum.
[02:44:49.874 --> 02:44:54.177]  But that's disreputable to be struck down by a bottom feeder.
[02:44:54.177 --> 02:44:54.878]  But you know what?
[02:44:55.938 --> 02:44:57.920]  I just, I don't have any fear.
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:59.821]  I've just committed everything to it.
[02:44:59.821 --> 02:45:02.463]  The family, everything, it's all in God's hands.
[02:45:02.463 --> 02:45:06.165]  Because I can't live in fear of these people.
[02:45:06.165 --> 02:45:09.807]  And, you know, usually who kills you is your security detail.
[02:45:09.807 --> 02:45:11.789]  And so we're all above board.
[02:45:11.789 --> 02:45:15.131]  We don't break any of their even phony unconstitutional laws.
[02:45:15.131 --> 02:45:16.932]  We just have our First Amendment.
[02:45:16.932 --> 02:45:18.473]  We stand strong in it.
[02:45:18.473 --> 02:45:23.917]  And we tell all their minions and servants, do you really want to keep going along with the globalists?
[02:45:24.795 --> 02:45:27.157]  Because they're destroying you as well.
[02:45:27.157 --> 02:45:33.002]  You didn't get a memo if you're some government hitman about the sodium fluoride or the vaccines.
[02:45:33.002 --> 02:45:41.949]  I bet a lot of you government people have a mama or a daddy dying at a young age of a degenerative disorder or something.
[02:45:41.949 --> 02:45:43.891]  I bet a lot of you got kids dying.
[02:45:43.891 --> 02:45:51.417]  You need to find out that you were already soft killed and that you should realize that I don't have courage.
[02:45:51.417 --> 02:45:52.859]  I recognize we're in a
[02:45:54.045 --> 02:45:58.026]  Terminal position, all of us, and all we can do is fight.
[02:45:58.026 --> 02:46:01.307]  We're in a chamber, the water's rising, we gotta get out of the chamber.
[02:46:01.307 --> 02:46:07.429]  I'm not gonna sit here and beg and be on the wall and say, please let me out, I'll join you, be nice to me.
[02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:14.171]  I'm not going to engage in any type of deals with these vampires, and I hear what you're saying.
[02:46:14.171 --> 02:46:15.652]  Anything else you'd like to add, Otter?
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:19.482]  Yes, there's a couple of real quickies here.
[02:46:19.482 --> 02:46:21.564]  Seditious behavior against the Republic.
[02:46:21.564 --> 02:46:23.725]  I think we've got to push that more and more and more.
[02:46:23.725 --> 02:46:33.852]  I think the super Congress, Libya, all the different things that you put up, the ipso facto nature of the world is upon us and needs to be...
[02:46:34.754 --> 02:46:36.976]  Spread further and further and further.
[02:46:36.976 --> 02:46:37.517]  Exactly.
[02:46:37.517 --> 02:46:44.843]  I mean, if we don't scream bloody murder when a classical dictatorship is being established, what about all these people that said we never have a dictatorship?
[02:46:44.843 --> 02:46:47.145]  The military industrial complex and I was a kook.
[02:46:47.145 --> 02:46:48.347]  It's here now.
[02:46:48.347 --> 02:46:49.347]  No one can deny.
[02:46:49.347 --> 02:46:51.209]  And here's the good part.
[02:46:51.209 --> 02:46:52.710]  It's only going to get worse faster.
[02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:58.656]  You know, now people have allowed this evil to rise and now it's going to only get worse.
[02:46:58.656 --> 02:46:59.557]  Isn't that fun?
[02:47:00.748 --> 02:47:01.408]  Great fun.
[02:47:01.408 --> 02:47:04.069]  And you know, it's against the law in this state to own a handgun.
[02:47:04.069 --> 02:47:07.431]  It's five years mandatory in prison if you get caught with one.
[02:47:07.431 --> 02:47:09.772]  Yeah, but all the mafia, they've all got their little waivers.
[02:47:09.772 --> 02:47:10.752]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:10.752 --> 02:47:12.093]  Good points.
[02:47:12.093 --> 02:47:14.754]  Let's talk to Rick in Connecticut.
[02:47:14.754 --> 02:47:16.514]  Welcome, Rick.
[02:47:16.514 --> 02:47:17.055]  Hey, Alex.
[02:47:17.055 --> 02:47:17.635]  How you doing?
[02:47:19.642 --> 02:47:22.544]  I just wanted to tell you that, uh, man, your show has blessed me.
[02:47:22.544 --> 02:47:27.588]  I've been listening for about the past three years, and, uh, the information is incredible.
[02:47:27.588 --> 02:47:35.814]  I had a family reunion this weekend down on the beach here, and I had about a hundred of our closest relatives come out, and I got to sit some of the folks straight on.
[02:47:35.814 --> 02:47:42.680]  Mr. Rick Perry, Mr. Obama, and, uh, tell you what, I probably sent about 50 people out to your website to sit down there one day.
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:48.123]  Did you have a government authorization for a hundred people to congregate?
[02:47:48.123 --> 02:47:50.664]  This sounds... this... a family?
[02:47:50.664 --> 02:47:51.684]  A cult?
[02:47:51.684 --> 02:47:56.347]  You know, the government officially in their manuals now says the family is a cult.
[02:47:56.347 --> 02:47:57.688]  God, you are sick!
[02:47:57.688 --> 02:48:00.469]  You actually met with people that you're genetically related to?
[02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:02.490]  That sounds racist!
[02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:03.591]  And I'll tell you what, Alex.
[02:48:03.591 --> 02:48:07.973]  One of my closest relatives is a president of a major university in the South.
[02:48:07.973 --> 02:48:09.854]  And I had to explain to him what a false flag was.
[02:48:11.769 --> 02:48:13.771]  But you say you set them straight.
[02:48:13.771 --> 02:48:16.154]  I mean, were folks listening to you?
[02:48:16.154 --> 02:48:16.975]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:48:16.975 --> 02:48:19.978]  I mean, I had a whole group just sitting around there going, yeah, yeah, right.
[02:48:19.978 --> 02:48:21.139]  I didn't know, I didn't know this was up.
[02:48:21.139 --> 02:48:22.901]  I didn't know this kind of information was available.
[02:48:22.901 --> 02:48:24.122]  I said, yeah, prisonplanet.com.
[02:48:25.402 --> 02:48:26.123]  I said, check it out.
[02:48:26.123 --> 02:48:26.783]  Three hours a day.
[02:48:26.783 --> 02:48:29.366]  If you can't catch it during the day, they run the broadcast all night.
[02:48:29.366 --> 02:48:32.869]  But you know, Rich, years ago, people probably wouldn't have been as receptive.
[02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:33.950]  That's what I found.
[02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:35.271]  Most people aren't laughing.
[02:48:35.271 --> 02:48:42.818]  Even two years ago, folks would laugh if I randomly somewhere was just talking to folks, you know, on vacation in a hot tub or whatever.
[02:48:42.818 --> 02:48:43.558]  They'd laugh.
[02:48:43.558 --> 02:48:44.779]  Now they go, yes, tell me more.
[02:48:44.779 --> 02:48:49.484]  I mean, see how reality setting in is getting them to put their thinking caps on?
[02:48:50.837 --> 02:49:01.224]  You have the people in the intelligentsia, I'm talking about the educational wing of the world, and they're seeing that their businesses be affected by the destruction of the middle class.
[02:49:01.224 --> 02:49:09.490]  You know, the kids aren't going to be able to get into college, they can't pay the tuitions, you know, and not that they're going to lose their money because they're all, that's tons of money set aside, but what I'm saying is,
[02:49:10.123 --> 02:49:13.807]  When it begins to affect them, then they start to see some of the handwriting on the wall.
[02:49:13.807 --> 02:49:14.747]  Let me be clear.
[02:49:14.747 --> 02:49:18.711]  The direction they're going, they could devalue a million dollars.
[02:49:18.711 --> 02:49:21.774]  You know, 10 years ago, a millionaire was a big deal.
[02:49:21.774 --> 02:49:25.998]  Now there's record numbers of millionaires because it's the equivalent of having like $200,000 in the bank, you know, 15, 20 years ago.
[02:49:29.161 --> 02:49:35.986]  Folks, they could go into hyperinflation so bad that a million dollars won't even buy a new car.
[02:49:35.986 --> 02:49:36.767]  Okay?
[02:49:36.767 --> 02:49:40.510]  So, a lot of these people that think, well, the economy's going down, but I'll be okay.
[02:49:40.510 --> 02:49:42.791]  Uh-uh, folks.
[02:49:42.791 --> 02:49:50.617]  I'm telling you, there are people, the way this is going, who've got five million dollars in the bank, who down the road aren't going to be able to live on that.
[02:49:50.617 --> 02:49:53.439]  That's what hyperinflation means.
[02:49:53.439 --> 02:49:54.060]  What do you think of that?
[02:49:55.515 --> 02:49:56.377]  Unbelievable.
[02:49:56.377 --> 02:49:59.405]  And Alex, I just want to let you know that, man, I pray for you every morning.
[02:49:59.405 --> 02:50:01.510]  Your protection, your wife, your kids.
[02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:03.495]  Lord, just keep your hand on you guys and keep you safe.
[02:50:03.925 --> 02:50:04.906]  Well, God bless you.
[02:50:04.906 --> 02:50:09.148]  You know, Mike Adams wrote an article a few days ago called, Is Alex Jones For Real?
[02:50:09.148 --> 02:50:13.591]  And then he goes through how great I am and how he's been around our operation and, ooh, it really is real.
[02:50:13.591 --> 02:50:15.272]  The information's real.
[02:50:15.272 --> 02:50:16.733]  The facts are real.
[02:50:16.733 --> 02:50:18.314]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:50:18.314 --> 02:50:20.455]  It's about you standing up.
[02:50:20.455 --> 02:50:22.297]  You know you're for real.
[02:50:22.297 --> 02:50:25.619]  Imagine how creepy it is to know I'm 100% real.
[02:50:25.619 --> 02:50:27.240]  To know I've always been real.
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:30.402]  To know that I really do face everything that I'm going up against.
[02:50:30.982 --> 02:50:32.903]  And I know I'm in God's hands.
[02:50:32.903 --> 02:50:40.366]  And then to see people always questioning and making stuff up and criticizing, it doesn't hurt me that they're attacking me.
[02:50:40.366 --> 02:50:44.127]  It hurts me that they don't have confidence in themselves.
[02:50:44.127 --> 02:50:48.849]  They don't believe that somebody could actually resist tyranny.
[02:50:48.849 --> 02:50:51.470]  They could do everything I've done and more.
[02:50:51.470 --> 02:50:52.851]  That's what's so sad.
[02:50:52.851 --> 02:50:57.453]  We could defeat these globalists, but we have to free our minds first.
[02:50:57.453 --> 02:50:59.113]  Key information straight ahead.
[02:50:59.113 --> 02:51:00.094]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.539 --> 02:51:07.946]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:51:07.946 --> 02:51:09.388]  I lost 20 pounds.
[02:51:09.388 --> 02:51:11.090]  I lost 40 pounds.
[02:51:11.090 --> 02:51:13.352]  I lost 55 pounds.
[02:51:13.352 --> 02:51:14.754]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[02:51:16.249 --> 02:51:23.135]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:51:23.135 --> 02:51:26.778]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:51:26.778 --> 02:51:30.862]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[02:51:30.862 --> 02:51:37.408]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:51:37.788 --> 02:51:45.975]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:53:31.834 --> 02:53:35.216]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:53:35.216 --> 02:53:43.400]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:48.702]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:53:48.702 --> 02:53:51.704]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[02:53:51.704 --> 02:53:55.606]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:53:55.606 --> 02:53:58.787]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:54:14.181 --> 02:54:17.003]  We're good to go.
[02:54:43.447 --> 02:54:48.930]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:48.930 --> 02:55:02.919]  And I will do the little supplemental five minutes of overdrive at prisonplanet.tv and the audio streams at infowares.com so I can get to a few more of your calls, like Mark and Leo at least, because they've been holding a long time.
[02:55:02.919 --> 02:55:06.861]  Sorry to the other callers, but we'll try to get to everybody.
[02:55:06.861 --> 02:55:07.301]  You know what?
[02:55:07.301 --> 02:55:11.284]  I can't really do justice to this, so I may shoot a special video report on it.
[02:55:13.925 --> 02:55:22.930]  I may even do a SpecialPrisonPlanet.tv entire special report on this and just do it live so that it can be extensive.
[02:55:22.930 --> 02:55:32.454]  But this illustrates for me everything, the spirit of the hypocrisy, the fact that the system isn't scared about being caught anymore because they're going for broke.
[02:55:32.454 --> 02:55:43.380]  And the psychological warfare chiefs have basically decided to just blatantly do all this out in the open because they've got such even more horrible things planned that they've got to get his condition now.
[02:55:44.821 --> 02:55:47.202]  That's why they've announced they're stealing the death benefits of the troops.
[02:55:47.202 --> 02:55:52.886]  They're getting ready to cut in at least half their retirement.
[02:55:52.886 --> 02:55:56.348]  They are getting ready to just absolutely devalue the dollar.
[02:55:56.348 --> 02:55:58.209]  I mean, this is some hardcore stuff.
[02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:03.422]  And if you don't want your farm taken and you resist, they're going to call you a terrorist.
[02:56:03.422 --> 02:56:05.984]  And they don't care if the SWAT team gets killed doing it.
[02:56:05.984 --> 02:56:07.625]  This is what they want.
[02:56:07.625 --> 02:56:09.226]  They love Libya in flames.
[02:56:09.226 --> 02:56:12.768]  They love putting the extremists in in Egypt.
[02:56:12.768 --> 02:56:15.530]  They love all this destabilization.
[02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:22.094]  And the globalists hate you as Americans probably a hundred times more than they hate the Muslims.
[02:56:22.094 --> 02:56:23.695]  They hate anybody they don't control.
[02:56:24.375 --> 02:56:27.138]  And they want to fully break this country forever.
[02:56:27.138 --> 02:56:28.820]  They hate our police.
[02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:30.482]  They hate our military.
[02:56:30.482 --> 02:56:32.144]  They've got files on cops.
[02:56:32.144 --> 02:56:34.106]  They've got files on the military.
[02:56:34.106 --> 02:56:36.629]  They know who the good cops are.
[02:56:36.629 --> 02:56:39.993]  And they hate you because they're criminals.
[02:56:39.993 --> 02:56:43.717]  And if they can't sell you on criminality, they're going to come after you.
[02:56:43.717 --> 02:56:44.899]  Study history.
[02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:56.862]  You know, I saw this article over the weekend and couldn't believe it, but now it's in Fox, AP, Reuters, and the media goes along with it like it's a pretty good thing.
[02:56:56.862 --> 02:57:01.623]  First responders decry exclusion from 9-11 ceremony.
[02:57:01.623 --> 02:57:12.246]  And because they've been critical over the poison dust and having their health care blocked, the first responders are told, you and your families are not welcome.
[02:57:14.226 --> 02:57:24.537]  Former President Bush, Obama, they're all going to grandstand and talk about how they're heroes and play video of the firefighters up there with Bush and the stupid bullhorn.
[02:57:24.537 --> 02:57:29.041]  And they just don't care.
[02:57:29.041 --> 02:57:29.742]  Here's another one.
[02:57:29.742 --> 02:57:31.404]  Heroes Terror Scrutiny.
[02:57:32.725 --> 02:57:34.286]  And we pushed for eight years.
[02:57:34.286 --> 02:57:45.130]  I went to events, lobbied, raised the money, you the listeners gave, to try to get health care for the police, the military, the firefighters who were denied health care.
[02:57:45.130 --> 02:57:46.691]  They told them, there's nothing wrong with your lungs.
[02:57:46.691 --> 02:57:50.552]  Well, the major university says it's full of asbestos in the CAT scan.
[02:57:50.552 --> 02:57:51.693]  Well, just go home and die.
[02:57:51.693 --> 02:57:55.314]  And most of them have had serious health problems or died.
[02:57:55.314 --> 02:57:59.876]  In fact, I've interviewed people that are now dead.
[02:57:59.876 --> 02:58:01.097]  Young men who are dead now.
[02:58:02.612 --> 02:58:04.913]  And they don't get the health care.
[02:58:04.913 --> 02:58:08.673]  And when they finally got it, the government said, OK, it's through Homeland Security.
[02:58:08.673 --> 02:58:11.814]  You've got to go through a terror database before you get any health care.
[02:58:11.814 --> 02:58:13.835]  Every time.
[02:58:13.835 --> 02:58:18.696]  Before sick 911 recovery workers can get aid, they have to prove they're not terrorists.
[02:58:18.696 --> 02:58:22.037]  A little notice provision of the health compensation law.
[02:58:22.037 --> 02:58:24.377]  And this is going to actually expand nationwide.
[02:58:24.377 --> 02:58:27.578]  Now to get, quote, jobs and infrastructure, you've got to get government approval.
[02:58:28.530 --> 02:58:29.650]  And then here's another one.
[02:58:29.650 --> 02:58:35.492]  So remember, the first responders, they're terrorists, they're scum, they're not welcome at Ground Zero.
[02:58:35.492 --> 02:58:37.352]  But the Libyan rebels, L.A.
[02:58:37.352 --> 02:58:39.293]  time, are admittedly Al-Qaeda.
[02:58:39.293 --> 02:58:43.794]  So Al-Qaeda is good, though!
[02:58:43.794 --> 02:58:47.274]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.274 --> 02:58:48.235]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.441 --> 02:58:54.143]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:54.143 --> 02:58:59.471]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:58:59.471 --> 02:59:00.993]  Saving means to make money.

[02:59:18.047 --> 02:59:26.049]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[02:59:52.205 --> 02:59:53.726]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.726 --> 02:59:55.788]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.788 --> 02:59:58.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.672 --> 03:00:10.132]  Alright, we're in overdrive.
[03:00:10.132 --> 03:00:11.773]  Let's jam in some calls here.
[03:00:11.773 --> 03:00:13.993]  I always enjoy hearing from you.
[03:00:13.993 --> 03:00:15.833]  Mark in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:00:15.833 --> 03:00:17.273]  Welcome.
[03:00:17.273 --> 03:00:18.154]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:18.154 --> 03:00:19.214]  Pleasure talking to you, man.
[03:00:19.214 --> 03:00:22.494]  I've been listening to you a long time, but I've never been able to get through.
[03:00:22.494 --> 03:00:33.016]  Hey, you know, I've been watching this thing with Libya, and I made a call to some clown on Fox News Talk, you know, on Sirius.
[03:00:33.016 --> 03:00:36.857]  A guy named Brian Kilme, a real jerk, you know, a real moron.
[03:00:39.091 --> 03:00:50.459]  I gave him a suggestion that we form a commando squad formed by Murdoch and led by the three women there, you know, Hillary and the other two.
[03:00:50.459 --> 03:00:54.202]  I call them sluts, which they probably are anyway.
[03:00:54.202 --> 03:01:01.047]  And then I said, on top of that, you could have, as the commander, you could have a guy like... Well, first off, sir, don't insult sluts.
[03:01:01.047 --> 03:01:01.247]  Come on.
[03:01:02.045 --> 03:01:03.047]  Alright, I guess you're right.
[03:01:03.047 --> 03:01:04.030]  I am, in a way.
[03:01:04.030 --> 03:01:06.956]  I really am, because they're a lot worse than that.
[03:01:06.956 --> 03:01:11.246]  But anyway, I said they could have their commander, Bill Crystal, and, um...
[03:01:12.270 --> 03:01:21.941]  Fred Barnes, you know, New World Order, Neocon News, and give them guns and let them go and do their thing, because you know what's going to happen.
[03:01:21.941 --> 03:01:27.707]  We're going to send troops in there, and God knows how many American soldiers are going to have to die.
[03:01:27.707 --> 03:01:28.849]  What did the host say?
[03:01:28.849 --> 03:01:30.651]  Is he proud of Al Qaeda?
[03:01:30.651 --> 03:01:32.452]  The minute I called him sluts, he hung up.
[03:01:35.151 --> 03:01:36.132]  Yeah.
[03:01:36.132 --> 03:01:41.918]  I mean, look, number one, those people, those kind of talk show hosts, I don't know who you're talking about, they're not idiots.
[03:01:41.918 --> 03:01:48.565]  They cold-bloodedly look at the scene, they know it's a bunch of bull they're reporting, and they decide to join with the dark side.
[03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:53.631]  And so, they've sold out the system.
[03:01:53.631 --> 03:01:57.313]  But see, they think the sellout only goes as far as they've gone.
[03:01:57.313 --> 03:02:01.415]  They don't know there are others who sell out a thousand times deeper.
[03:02:01.415 --> 03:02:03.616]  And so, they think they're part of the winning team.
[03:02:03.616 --> 03:02:04.596]  They're not.
[03:02:04.596 --> 03:02:05.937]  That's the big scam.
[03:02:05.937 --> 03:02:08.338]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:08.338 --> 03:02:13.800]  It is important to call Talk Radio and work a little InfoWars.com into the discussion.
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:16.842]  What I'm doing is saying, oh, by the way, what do you think of InfoWars.com?
[03:02:18.149 --> 03:02:20.550]  Leo, you're on the air.
[03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:21.571]  Welcome.
[03:02:21.571 --> 03:02:23.612]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:23.612 --> 03:02:33.998]  My sources here in Missouri have revealed to me that this earthquake was led by Al-Qaeda and we must bomb the fault lines immediately in the name of peace.
[03:02:33.998 --> 03:02:35.719]  Well, absolutely.
[03:02:35.719 --> 03:02:47.046]  Like we earlier, a caller has confirmed it, it was on a message board, that the Keebler elves working with Osama Bin Laden are digging tunnels under the Capitol because they hate our freedom.
[03:02:47.955 --> 03:02:58.404]  And the bad thing is, you know, I could probably see them coming out and saying that, or saying it was Muammar Gaddafi that he escaped and crawled up underneath Virginia and created that earthquake.
[03:02:58.404 --> 03:03:02.107]  Well, he probably did, but don't worry, Al-Qaeda's going to show him.
[03:03:02.107 --> 03:03:04.289]  You're not going to talk bad about Al-Qaeda, are you?
[03:03:04.289 --> 03:03:10.774]  I mean, there are valiant forces, but the first responders aren't allowed at Ground Zero.
[03:03:10.774 --> 03:03:12.396]  Can you believe how evil this government is?
[03:03:13.393 --> 03:03:18.437]  Well, actually, since I've been listening to you over the last eight years, yeah, more and more I can see it and I believe it.
[03:03:18.437 --> 03:03:22.840]  Yeah, but I can't even believe they're telling the first responders they're not welcome.
[03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:23.541]  But you know why?
[03:03:23.541 --> 03:03:24.682]  I've talked to them.
[03:03:24.682 --> 03:03:28.324]  I mean, literally, most of the first responders know it's an inside job now.
[03:03:28.324 --> 03:03:30.566]  They can't have them there.
[03:03:30.566 --> 03:03:30.986]  Exactly.
[03:03:30.986 --> 03:03:38.352]  They don't want that message getting out, you know, to, from people that were there, to people that haven't believed it all this time.
[03:03:39.790 --> 03:03:41.491]  They don't want that getting out to anybody.
[03:03:41.491 --> 03:03:42.332]  Absolutely.
[03:03:42.332 --> 03:03:43.513]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[03:03:43.513 --> 03:03:46.334]  Okay, let's jam in another one here.
[03:03:46.334 --> 03:03:49.877]  Let's talk to Lynn in New York.
[03:03:49.877 --> 03:03:50.577]  Last caller.
[03:03:50.577 --> 03:03:51.278]  Thank you for holding.
[03:03:52.315 --> 03:03:52.995]  Thank you.
[03:03:52.995 --> 03:04:01.159]  I really need you to admit the fact that people don't even realize right now, even now, that the market is the one that's the problem.
[03:04:01.159 --> 03:04:06.961]  People still think, ah, the money market, I should buy gold because then I'm safe.
[03:04:06.961 --> 03:04:12.424]  Because money, the value of the money is going down, but the gold is not.
[03:04:12.424 --> 03:04:15.505]  They don't really get the fact that it is the money that's the problem.
[03:04:15.505 --> 03:04:19.567]  That the past 40 years of the monetary system has been sucking the real value out of the
[03:04:19.887 --> 03:04:20.407]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:04:20.407 --> 03:04:22.928]  They think gold's bad because it costs more now.
[03:04:22.928 --> 03:04:23.728]  They don't understand.
[03:04:23.728 --> 03:04:25.768]  It's because the dollar's getting killed.
[03:04:25.768 --> 03:04:30.729]  But you're not going to be able to help those folks that call up sometimes and go, why do I want to buy gold again?
[03:04:30.729 --> 03:04:32.930]  You try to explain it and they go, ugh.
[03:04:32.930 --> 03:04:35.830]  I mean, those folks probably can't even tie their shoelaces.
[03:04:35.830 --> 03:04:37.411]  And I'm sorry for them.
[03:04:37.411 --> 03:04:39.491]  You know?
[03:04:39.491 --> 03:04:40.911]  Resolution 1489N.
[03:04:40.911 --> 03:04:43.172]  They need to call their Congress.
[03:04:44.281 --> 03:04:44.742]  They do.
[03:04:44.742 --> 03:04:46.263]  You're absolutely right.
[03:04:46.263 --> 03:04:47.665]  I am just out of time.
[03:04:47.665 --> 03:04:49.447]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:49.447 --> 03:04:51.169]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
