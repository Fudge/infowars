[00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:10.317]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:11.898]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:13.819]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.641]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:27.358]  Here we are, Thursday, the 20th day of January 2011.
[00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:32.903]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours at least.
[00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:41.091]  Dr. Jerome Corsi will be joining us coming up in T-minus an hour and a half to get into the bizarre statements of the governor of Hawaii, Abucrombie.
[00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:49.877]  Which has been interpreted by many to say they can't find the actual birth certificate but have a record that one was created in 1961.
[00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:54.120]  He'll be joining us for 30 minutes in the second half of the next hour.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.322]  There is just a ton of incredibly important news I want to go over.
[00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:02.566]  Obviously the House has passed the government takeover of health care.
[00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.968]  They have passed the repeal of that.
[00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:09.791]  Also the news is reporting that the biggest mafia bust in history
[00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:14.480]  Has netted more than 100 members of organized crime.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.328]  And it's a bunch of slobs in the photos and video I've seen in blue collar jogging suits.
[00:01:22.328 --> 00:01:30.116]  If you believe that this is the actual real mafia in this country, these are low level gangsters.
[00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.597]  Uh, and this is just another level of the lie.
[00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:41.945]  Back in the 40s and even 50s, we were told by the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, that Locosa Nostra was a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:42.966]  He said that in Congress.
[00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:47.931]  It did not exist, because reportedly they had photos of him dressed up like a woman with his boyfriend.
[00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:51.973]  The deputy director of the FBI.
[00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:54.734]  And so they were blackmailing him and they said it just doesn't exist.
[00:01:54.734 --> 00:02:09.080]  And then once they had to admit that it existed, because state police and others started busting them themselves at the state level, they said, oh, it's only Italians, only Italians engage in hereditary crime syndicates.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.531]  No, every racial and regional and religious group on the planet has always formed organized crime systems.
[00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.615]  It's called hereditary gangs.
[00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:22.558]  And this is how humans operate.
[00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:25.161]  And every major group on this planet
[00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:40.654]  It doesn't matter what region, what part of the world, Africa, China, the United States, Europe, Israel, did I say Russia, Latin America, they've all got games and it's always organized around a racial or religious background because that's what binds these groups together.
[00:02:41.454 --> 00:03:02.648]  But the Italian mafia is a small overall component of this, certainly bad guys, but not one-tenth as venomous as some of the more murderous mafias out there that put them to shame, like the Russian mafia, which of course is heavily backed by the Russian government.
[00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:07.689]  So we're going to be looking at this whitewasher today, the biggest mafia bust.
[00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.431]  Of course, the big mafia is the syndicated crime syndicate of the banking cartel.
[00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:20.574]  And that's who really dominates all of this, and the other crime syndicates are just bottom feeders compared to that.
[00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:26.716]  It is the global crime syndicate that steals the trillions a month and that is shoving our world into world government.
[00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:33.989]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today as well.
[00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.554]  But we are going to continue also looking at the Communist dictator's visit.
[00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.677]  Hu Jintao to the United States.
[00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:44.197]  We're going to
[00:03:45.878 --> 00:04:14.084]  Breakdown also Virginia lawmakers are looking to stop climate change probe and I was listening to the radio this morning and heard Fox News reporting that the federal government Has withdrawn its support For a climate change report that's been being used it turns out that's fraudulent just like all the other big reports but it isn't stopping the Different federal agencies
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:26.208]  Like the Energy Department and other organizations, the Environmental Protection Agency, from going into Texas and other states and trying to basically shut down our power plants.
[00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:28.030]  And there's all these crazy statements.
[00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.274]  We saw it a few days ago from the head of the Goddard Space Center saying China's done a great job on the environment.
[00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:34.355]  That's why they're going to take over.
[00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:41.858]  I saw other news articles today saying China is getting tough on the environment and we're not, and that's why they're rising.
[00:04:41.858 --> 00:04:42.898]  It's just a total lie.
[00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:46.559]  China basically has no environmental rules.
[00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:51.120]  We have them stacked sky high, and that's why we can't compete.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.021]  And it's just a total fraud.
[00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:56.681]  So that's all coming up as well on the other side.
[00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:58.982]  And I never got to that fluoride story I mentioned yesterday.
[00:04:58.982 --> 00:04:59.782]  I'm going to cover that first.
[00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:05.257]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:05:05.257 --> 00:05:06.157]  Number 1.
[00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:09.580]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.440]  Number 2.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.343]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.343 --> 00:05:16.084]  It's true.
[00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:20.947]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.947 --> 00:05:21.787]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:25.370]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.072]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.272 --> 00:05:30.072]  Number 4.
[00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:32.813]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:36.514]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:37.295]  Number 5.
[00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:41.436]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:46.498]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.498 --> 00:05:50.659]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.459]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:57.061]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:06:01.382 --> 00:06:16.868]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:06:16.868 --> 00:06:20.549]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:21.553 --> 00:06:34.325]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:41.592]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:52.658]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:56.580]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.682]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:04.644]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:11.049]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:18.435]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:23.319]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.441]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.695]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:42.995]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:46.877]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:46.877 --> 00:07:53.240]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.040]  Thank you.
[00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:15.494]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:16.735]  We are live.
[00:08:16.735 --> 00:08:20.116]  It is Thursday, January 20th, 2011.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.821]  I'm still not used to saying 2011.
[00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:27.982]  By the time I'm accustomed to it, it'll be 2012.
[00:08:27.982 --> 00:08:29.523]  Hard to believe.
[00:08:29.523 --> 00:08:32.544]  Obama says we welcome China's rise.
[00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:33.804]  Well, great!
[00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:42.768]  If China wasn't authoritarian, dictatorial, arming itself to the teeth against the U.S., if their top generals weren't in official government,
[00:08:43.328 --> 00:08:47.910]  Publications every week talking about gearing up for war against the US.
[00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:55.775]  And if our own, quote, elites, the offshore banking cartel, wasn't positioning China against us.
[00:08:55.775 --> 00:09:02.058]  If they weren't openly crowing that China is going to replace the United States as the world superpower.
[00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:07.204]  After the United States has financed all of this.
[00:09:07.204 --> 00:09:09.165]  That's the big issue here.
[00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:10.326]  That's the big problem.
[00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:14.870]  I get so many emails and see so many comments saying, Alex, Asia's rioting.
[00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.152]  You know, China's got big population problems.
[00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:19.313]  China's got big rebellion problems.
[00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:21.295]  China is teetering on the edge of collapse.
[00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:22.416]  Don't worry about them.
[00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:25.654]  I'm not worried about China.
[00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:31.818]  I'm worried about the geopolitical stratagem that has been developed openly by Henry Kissinger and others.
[00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:42.526]  He was on Charlie Rose last night bragging that thanks to the economic crisis, the crisis he talked about designing for decades, that now people are accepting the New World Order.
[00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:48.431]  Now all the countries are getting in line and there's announcements about how
[00:09:51.002 --> 00:09:56.526]  $100 trillion of additional credit is needed to save the world economy.
[00:09:56.526 --> 00:10:02.850]  That means $100 trillion additional to the private banks who then hoard it and use it to buy up the imploding economy.
[00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.531]  This is their takeover plan.
[00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:10.475]  And every time we do what they say and go along with their banker bailouts and their takeovers, things only get worse.
[00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:11.876]  And then they've got a new solution.
[00:10:11.876 --> 00:10:13.237]  Give them even more power.
[00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:14.397]  Then they've got another solution.
[00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:15.698]  Even more, more, more, more.
[00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.559]  We go back two and a half years ago to October of 2008,
[00:10:19.977 --> 00:10:22.421]  They had national polls of 99 percent.
[00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:28.392]  They were getting thousand-to-one phone calls in Congress against what was happening.
[00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:32.799]  But the Congress was bought and paid for and went ahead with it, including many Republicans.
[00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:37.920]  So we're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.144]  Good news, House passes health law repeal.
[00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:44.167]  The bad news is it doesn't have that much of a chance in the Senate.
[00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:54.999]  Unless we get serious and introduce the political idea, the political narrative that's constitutional, then how about we start impeaching members of the Senate?
[00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.714]  How about we start trying to impeach Obama for doing something unconstitutional?
[00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:11.761]  How about we put this into a constitutional crisis, knowing we have the Constitution on our side, and force its repeal now before they begin implementing it this year?
[00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:14.964]  With hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:11:14.964 --> 00:11:16.565]  Last time it was over 500.
[00:11:16.565 --> 00:11:25.072]  Every week, scores of new megacompanies and other even small companies that have made donations to the Democrats, they get exemptions from the healthcare.
[00:11:25.572 --> 00:11:27.292]  It's unconstitutional right there.
[00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:27.993]  It's unfair.
[00:11:27.993 --> 00:11:29.753]  It's discriminatory.
[00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:34.194]  My operation, as this gets put into place, I'm going to have to get health care.
[00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:38.195]  And all that means is you come to your employees and say, OK, here's the federal law.
[00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:39.195]  I got to pay for half of it.
[00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:40.556]  You got to pay for half.
[00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:43.516]  I'm cutting your pay by 25 percent or more.
[00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:44.937]  Sorry, the government says so.
[00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.817]  They're like, but we want to buy our own health care.
[00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:49.278]  We want to go this route.
[00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:49.938]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:50.638]  You don't have a choice.
[00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:51.761]  Yeah.
[00:12:22.503 --> 00:12:27.959]  Get to this report because I mentioned it at the start of the broadcast yesterday and I never got to it.
[00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:50.146]  And again, imagine how much more of this is going on that I'm not aware of or that you're not aware of, because I just happened to be on my YouTube channel looking at how many views that special we put out last week, a 10-minute report on the government's admission that sodium fluoride is hurting children after all these decades of denial as the evidence piled up.
[00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:58.112]  I did a 10-minute report that is very detailed with links and documents showing the seven-fold increase in cancer in men.
[00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:00.213]  I've always said at least a doubling.
[00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:01.514]  We actually have the government documents.
[00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.036]  It's a sevenfold.
[00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:05.898]  If I don't have the documents in front of me, I always just kind of lowball it.
[00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:08.801]  It's an overall tripling if you average men and women together.
[00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:10.242]  But all the numbers are there.
[00:13:10.242 --> 00:13:12.524]  It's all linked.
[00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:13.625]  And I saw a comment
[00:13:14.938 --> 00:13:25.160]  On their saying, yeah, I was watching the local news here in San Jose, California, and they said a man went into a house that was being fumigated for insects.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.201]  They only use this for either cockroaches or bed bugs.
[00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:35.043]  They didn't say what the issue was, but a big tent over the house, big yellow and black tent with giant warning signs everywhere.
[00:13:35.043 --> 00:13:36.343]  The people are having it fumigated.
[00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:43.308]  And the guy said, the news didn't mention it, but the signs that they pointed out, the police said, well, there's no liability here.
[00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:45.129]  The signs said deadly gas.
[00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:45.710]  Don't go in.
[00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.473]  And the guy broke in and was found dead when the exterminators returned the next day.
[00:13:49.473 --> 00:13:54.497]  And in that report, on the signs, it says fluoride.
[00:13:55.484 --> 00:14:09.833]  And specifically, it's sulfuryl fluoride, which is just basically an aerosolized form of sodium fluoride, which, of course, is one of the main ingredients in decon rat poison and in many other poisons.
[00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:11.554]  It's just flat-out sodium fluoride.
[00:14:11.554 --> 00:14:13.276]  If you want to see that, just search the term
[00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:30.529]  Fluoride rat poison and you'll see news articles and cutouts of the Ingredients on the cans blown up On modern rat poisons and going back over a hundred years also a cockroach poison that they've been using for a long time You just spread out a white powder.
[00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:32.391]  The main ingredient is sodium fluoride.
[00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:35.453]  This is what they're putting in our water but the issue here is
[00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:42.157]  That this is how deadly fluoride is, is this guy went in there and succumbed and died from it.
[00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:44.577]  Okay, from fluoride gas.
[00:14:44.577 --> 00:14:51.839]  And the headline is, Man Dies After House Fumigated With Same Fluoride Compound Sprayed On Food.
[00:14:51.839 --> 00:15:01.300]  And there you see on the screen, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, the simulcast, the radio show, it says, Sodium Fluoride Kills Roaches, Crickets, Waterbugs, Silverfish.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:01.781]  W.R.
[00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:03.521]  Sweeney, MFR, Inc.,
[00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:07.782]  Salisbury, Missouri.
[00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:11.883]  And it says, warning, if you swallow this, it'll kill you.
[00:15:11.883 --> 00:15:13.824]  It's got skull and crossbones there.
[00:15:13.824 --> 00:15:16.925]  You can pull up several other of them that go over that.
[00:15:16.925 --> 00:15:20.706]  But it says, warning, may be fatal if swallowed.
[00:15:20.706 --> 00:15:22.707]  So, there you have it.
[00:15:22.707 --> 00:15:32.010]  And that particular can of stuff from back in the 50s was 98 cents for a big, juicy can of sodium fluoride.
[00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:45.119]  What's happening is the social engineers can get away with brazen things back in the 50s to say, oh, the federal government says sodium fluoride is good for your teeth, it's wonderful, we're gonna put it in your water.
[00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:57.668]  Of course, we have all the documents, and those are linked in the video, the 10-minute video, where Rockefeller Foundation and others discuss using things like sodium fluoride, also adding different chemicals to vaccines to reduce fertility.
[00:15:57.668 --> 00:16:01.792]  They said, well, if we totally sterilize everybody, they'll notice, but if we just incrementally do it,
[00:16:02.392 --> 00:16:03.573]  They won't notice as much.
[00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:22.093]  It needs to be seen.
[00:16:22.093 --> 00:16:23.534]  We can save a lot of people.
[00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:25.997]  This is something folks can take action on now.
[00:16:25.997 --> 00:16:30.402]  Man dies after house fumigated with same fluoride compound sprayed on food.
[00:16:30.402 --> 00:16:32.584]  And that's the other big angle on this.
[00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:37.729]  There are two kinds of approved derivatives of sodium fluoride.
[00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.650]  We're good to go!
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.382]  Having big granaries in places where they're having weevil or rat problems, they just gas it.
[00:17:13.382 --> 00:17:17.564]  And it does get into the food, trace amounts.
[00:17:17.564 --> 00:17:19.725]  So this is very, very serious.
[00:17:19.725 --> 00:17:23.127]  People need to know this.
[00:17:23.127 --> 00:17:28.349]  Let's go ahead and play this local news clip that we have screenshots of the video.
[00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:33.412]  Danger, fumigation, sulfuryl fluoride,
[00:17:35.277 --> 00:17:44.742]  And then there's another name of another derivative of fluoride on it, so there's two different types they sprayed in, and it's got skull and crossbones on it and says, do not get anywhere near.
[00:17:44.742 --> 00:17:54.508]  So let's go ahead and play the video of this, and hopefully everybody will take
[00:17:55.387 --> 00:17:57.549]  ...this to heart and warn their friends and family.
[00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:58.249]  Here it is.
[00:17:58.249 --> 00:17:59.250]  ...is new at 10.
[00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.914]  KTVU's Lloyd LaCosta, live in San Jose, outside the home on Lanier Lane, just south of Tully Road.
[00:18:04.914 --> 00:18:07.036]  He joins us now with late details on the story.
[00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:08.076]  Lloyd?
[00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:13.320]  Frank, San Jose Police tonight told me they have identified the suspect, but they have yet to notify next of kin.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:23.608]  They say this is not a case of homicide, but they are baffled by why would someone enter a house vented, tented for fumigation, and with clearly posted signs warning of the danger.
[00:18:24.622 --> 00:18:26.003]  We are living here and we're surprised.
[00:18:26.003 --> 00:18:28.866]  I don't know how the person got in there.
[00:18:28.866 --> 00:18:30.608]  Maybe, you know, they got an investigation or what.
[00:18:30.608 --> 00:18:31.209]  I don't know.
[00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:36.554]  Neighbors say the house had been foreclosed by the bank and was vacant for several months.
[00:18:36.554 --> 00:18:42.100]  A buyer closed escrow earlier this month and was remodeling the three-bedroom home.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.285]  The fumigation tent went up on Saturday and signs were clearly posted warning of the danger.
[00:18:47.739 --> 00:18:58.368]  It was kind of strange and I don't know how they, I mean the guys that were here fumigating, I don't know how they knew that the guy was inside.
[00:18:58.368 --> 00:19:02.531]  When workers came this afternoon, they found the body inside.
[00:19:02.531 --> 00:19:12.439]  Police speculate the victim was either homeless, looking for a warm place to spend the night, or it was a burglary attempt and the man was overcome by the fumigation fumes.
[00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:20.216]  That's a scare for me as well, because I'm living in here, you know, and I really didn't expect that happening here.
[00:19:20.216 --> 00:19:21.617]  Because it's a very quiet area.
[00:19:21.617 --> 00:19:25.280]  You can watch the rest of it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.221]  We're linked to the local TV station.
[00:19:27.221 --> 00:19:28.623]  But that's another issue.
[00:19:28.623 --> 00:19:30.944]  All over the country with this bed bug infestation.
[00:19:30.944 --> 00:19:33.887]  I know they're using this all over Austin in apartments.
[00:19:33.887 --> 00:19:37.129]  What happens when you're next door or below it or above it?
[00:19:37.129 --> 00:19:39.271]  What about these workers?
[00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:41.133]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:46.472]  But I guess they say fluoride's good for you, so there you go.
[00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:48.454]  But it isn't good for roaches or bed bugs.
[00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:49.896]  Kills them deader than a hammer.
[00:19:49.896 --> 00:19:52.158]  Being spread on our food.
[00:19:52.158 --> 00:19:57.084]  They're basically nerve gassing it when it's being kept in warehouses to keep the bugs off.
[00:19:57.084 --> 00:19:58.505]  It's not good for us, folks.
[00:19:58.505 --> 00:19:59.046]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:07.486]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[00:21:03.141 --> 00:21:05.462]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.462 --> 00:21:08.664]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.664 --> 00:21:13.766]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:17.968]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:20.729]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:23.510]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.432]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.432 --> 00:21:34.035]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:39.760]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.603]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.603 --> 00:21:46.287]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:47.368]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:48.709]  You're everyone else.

[00:22:29.435 --> 00:22:30.676]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:30.676 --> 00:22:35.239]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:41.043]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.043 --> 00:22:44.685]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:44.685 --> 00:22:47.407]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:52.470]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:22:59.735 --> 00:23:02.977]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:02.977 --> 00:23:07.860]  Did you know that it doesn't matter which political party occupies the White House?
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:14.123]  They have both been captured by those who are working for world government and the destruction of our Constitution.
[00:23:14.123 --> 00:23:23.368]  They believe that governments formed in the 18th and 19th centuries based upon constitutional rights of the people are now obsolete and need to be changed.
[00:23:24.128 --> 00:23:27.951]  That change will be to communism, socialism, fascism.
[00:23:27.951 --> 00:23:31.774]  A form of government that takes away all our rights.
[00:23:31.774 --> 00:23:40.682]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.984]  Call now while operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:08.956 --> 00:24:12.097]  Coming up later in the next hour, we've got some breaking news.
[00:24:12.097 --> 00:24:16.979]  I was just shown this during the break by Tim Fruge here in our office.
[00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:23.841]  Anderson Cooper vs. Congressman Cohen debate is comparing Republicans to Nazis wrong.
[00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:26.042]  And I saw this already in the news today.
[00:24:26.042 --> 00:24:29.823]  It's made it into quite a few newspapers that he reportedly
[00:24:30.823 --> 00:24:36.345]  said this last night, and it's already in the news today, obviously.
[00:24:36.345 --> 00:24:37.545]  And guess who he goes after?
[00:24:37.545 --> 00:24:40.286]  Jesse Ventura, who now is out of the country.
[00:24:40.286 --> 00:24:42.526]  I know he would respond to this.
[00:24:42.526 --> 00:24:54.349]  And True TV, and How Dare Us, the show that I really consulted on and then had my seal on more than any of the other 16 programs that have aired, and I consulted on almost all of them.
[00:24:54.349 --> 00:24:54.929]  I mean, that was 80%
[00:24:57.751 --> 00:25:00.093]  My research, my stamp.
[00:25:00.093 --> 00:25:01.234]  And I'm proud of that.
[00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:03.536]  You've heard Ventura thank me here on air for the help.
[00:25:03.536 --> 00:25:06.438]  Our footage of the FEMA camp, the documents.
[00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:09.601]  We told them about what was already publicly available.
[00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:13.604]  The model states Health Emergency Powers Act for roundups during pandemics.
[00:25:13.604 --> 00:25:20.129]  The secret documents from the state of New York dealing with mass graves during pandemics.
[00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:23.312]  The models
[00:25:25.689 --> 00:25:25.949]  I don't
[00:25:46.941 --> 00:26:00.292]  46 minutes of broadcast hour-long program total with the commercials in there and he has just gone so far out here claiming that basically the Arizona shooting was connected to anybody criticizing the government.
[00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:19.606]  When it's well known now that Jared Lee Loeffler was a out-of-his-mind hallucinogen addict who was a liberal and who was obsessed with the congresswoman who now they say is leaving the hospital this week and going to a Texas rehabilitation center.
[00:26:19.606 --> 00:26:21.768]  So we're certainly glad to hear that.
[00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:22.669]  But this whole story
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.831]  Just get stranger and stranger by the minute.
[00:26:25.831 --> 00:26:30.274]  So I'm going to cover that at 8 after starting the second segment of the next hour.
[00:26:30.274 --> 00:26:37.179]  We're going to be going over that because it is just absolutely incredible what this congressman is up to.
[00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:40.461]  Now, Homeland Security put pressure on Time Warner.
[00:26:41.394 --> 00:26:48.256]  Which by the way, on CNN, I haven't seen the whole 14 minute clip, I only watched a few minutes, but didn't see them mention that.
[00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:54.439]  And this is a show promoted on Larry King Live and on other CNN shows in the last two years.
[00:26:54.439 --> 00:26:56.659]  And they thought, I guess, that people wouldn't take it serious.
[00:26:56.659 --> 00:26:58.120]  Well, they did take it serious.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.701]  And I'm very proud to have been associated with the show.
[00:27:01.701 --> 00:27:06.063]  And Ventura had a private bet with myself and others that the first season would not air.
[00:27:07.123 --> 00:27:09.746]  Uh, but the head of TruTV said, look, I've never been censored.
[00:27:09.746 --> 00:27:11.747]  They never tell me what I can and can't put on.
[00:27:11.747 --> 00:27:14.890]  They vetted and fact-checked it all and they put it on.
[00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:21.897]  And, uh, then they had all sorts of, uh, dirty tricks going on that they don't want me to get into, uh, behind the scenes.
[00:27:21.897 --> 00:27:28.262]  Uh, you heard, uh, Braverman, one of the producers and others here say, look, you're lucky this is on the air before it even got pulled.
[00:27:28.262 --> 00:27:30.624]  He said, there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[00:27:31.747 --> 00:27:35.308]  And it probably won't be airing next year in a season.
[00:27:35.308 --> 00:27:38.829]  I haven't been told that, but that's what's in the wind.
[00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:42.150]  And they are pulling not just one episode, but others.
[00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.791]  Now the evidence is showing and they're doing something unprecedented.
[00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:52.693]  And I've got internal documents on this that obviously the sources have given us and asked that we not show because it'll tell people exactly who it is.
[00:27:52.693 --> 00:27:53.533]  Not with true TV.
[00:27:53.533 --> 00:27:55.014]  This is inside cable.
[00:27:55.834 --> 00:28:02.756]  Local cable companies getting the orders to erase all of the episodes off DVRs remotely.
[00:28:02.756 --> 00:28:07.778]  So this is just unprecedented censorship that's going on.
[00:28:07.778 --> 00:28:13.400]  And I don't like the fact that Congressman Cohen is running around doing this unchallenged.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.782]  The word I got is the ADL was putting pressure on AOL.
[00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:19.685]  That's
[00:28:35.732 --> 00:28:38.134]  This is just a photo sent to us by a listener.
[00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:49.145]  I'd like to get an article written on this and tie it into the Viper teams and the Homeland Security teams and the 9,000 locations getting telescreens telling you to watch other shoppers and your neighbors with Homeland Security messages.
[00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:51.948]  But now it says, for your safety, please no parking.
[00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:52.188]  U.S.
[00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:54.290]  Department of Homeland Security.
[00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:58.614]  And this is at a Stu Leonard Supermark in Yonkers, New York.
[00:28:59.375 --> 00:29:02.099]  That says, from a reader, I thought you'd like to see the attached picture.
[00:29:02.099 --> 00:29:08.107]  It was taken by a friend of mine in the parking lot of a Stuart Leonard's, uh, Stu Leonard's supermarket in Yonkers, New York.
[00:29:08.107 --> 00:29:14.415]  I guess the DHS can, uh, tell us where and where not to, uh, park.
[00:29:15.393 --> 00:29:18.494]  The sign was placed near the propane tanks.
[00:29:18.494 --> 00:29:20.335]  And again, the message is terrorists are everywhere.
[00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:22.295]  They may try to blow up propane tanks.
[00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:32.098]  So now you have this federal jurisdiction, this extrajudicial zoning, where they go into parking lots, at grocery stores, in front of gas stations, and they're just Homeland Security signs.
[00:29:32.098 --> 00:29:33.879]  Oh, sorry, can't use these parking spaces now.
[00:29:33.879 --> 00:29:41.601]  You know how you pull up to 7-Eleven, or you pull up to Home Depot, or you pull up and there's the propane tanks, Rhino propane, whatever the case may be?
[00:29:41.601 --> 00:29:42.901]  I bought a lot of it to barbecue.
[00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:44.602]  You know, it's all locked up in cages.
[00:29:45.694 --> 00:29:48.456]  Well now, CEO, you can't be trusted to even park there.
[00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:51.318]  Al-Qaeda may drive a truck up there and blow it up.
[00:29:51.318 --> 00:29:52.719]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.719 --> 00:29:55.241]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:57.924]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.974 --> 00:30:02.134]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:09.057]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:11.618]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:11.618 --> 00:30:16.999]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:20.040]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.101]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:22.341 --> 00:30:28.606]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:28.606 --> 00:30:31.988]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:31.988 --> 00:30:37.773]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:37.773 --> 00:30:39.414]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:39.414 --> 00:30:40.695]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:43.377]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:43.377 --> 00:30:47.600]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.321]  You can find the video at www.
[00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:52.204]  End of America 3.com.
[00:30:52.204 --> 00:30:54.806]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:30:54.806 --> 00:30:57.809]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:30:57.809 --> 00:30:58.429]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:04.616]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:04.616 --> 00:31:05.917]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:05.917 --> 00:31:10.320]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:16.264]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:16.264 --> 00:31:18.406]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:18.406 --> 00:31:21.088]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:31:21.428 --> 00:31:27.933]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:31:27.933 --> 00:31:30.135]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:31:30.135 --> 00:31:35.479]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:31:35.479 --> 00:31:40.763]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:31:40.763 --> 00:31:45.907]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:31:46.127 --> 00:31:49.328]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:31:49.328 --> 00:31:52.329]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:53.090]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.634]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.634 --> 00:32:08.877]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.877 --> 00:32:13.681]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:20.067]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:20.067 --> 00:32:22.310]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:23.150]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:23.670]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.471]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:24.471 --> 00:32:25.611]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:27.852]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.758 --> 00:32:49.021]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:32:49.021 --> 00:32:58.144]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:27.124]  Okay, again, we have these photos linked up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and these are popping up all over the country as the federal government takes over every facet of our society ahead of the admission that we're going into an economic collapse.
[00:33:27.124 --> 00:33:32.466]  And if you want to find it, you just search the terms, Homeland Security orders Americans around in the parking lot.
[00:33:33.126 --> 00:33:36.949]  And this is again in Yonkers, New York at a grocery store.
[00:33:36.949 --> 00:33:39.491]  For your safety, please no parking.
[00:33:39.491 --> 00:33:39.791]  U.S.
[00:33:39.791 --> 00:33:42.734]  Department of Homeland Security.
[00:33:42.734 --> 00:33:51.761]  And then here's another photo that Matt Ryan found of a similar sign out front of a store just simply saying, Homeland Security.
[00:33:51.761 --> 00:33:54.363]  All suspicious persons and activities are immediately reported
[00:33:54.943 --> 00:33:57.746]  To our law enforcement agency.
[00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:01.009]  But it's just this message that homeland security, homeland security.
[00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:04.713]  The other side actually has the homeland security seal on it.
[00:34:04.713 --> 00:34:10.019]  And they're saying the TSA, they're going to use the roads as their quote jurisdiction.
[00:34:10.019 --> 00:34:14.163]  And that was talked about in the North American Union SPP documents that we got in 2007.
[00:34:15.825 --> 00:34:18.528]  They tried to block the release but Judicial Watch sued and got them.
[00:34:18.528 --> 00:34:23.214]  They said we're going to use the threat of terror as a way to merge Canada, the U.S.
[00:34:23.214 --> 00:34:32.965]  and Mexico and to unify the security systems and we're going to use the highways to tax people as part of this new North American Union to fund the SPP.
[00:34:33.746 --> 00:34:42.053]  So they're moving forward with all of this right now, and it's a classic authoritarian takeover model.
[00:34:42.053 --> 00:34:53.303]  But if you talk about it, or the Threat Fusion Centers admittedly spying on people, or the Threat Fusion Centers illegally going to Ron Paul, Campaign for Liberty meetings that Ron Paul is at in Houston and other areas.
[00:34:53.303 --> 00:34:56.806]  I'm going to bring this up to him Friday when he joins us in the first hour.
[00:34:56.806 --> 00:35:01.590]  And spying on Ron Paul and Ron Paul supporters, and Bob Barr supporters.
[00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:10.253]  The MIAC reported two years ago is now just manifesting itself publicly.
[00:35:10.253 --> 00:35:20.736]  And they're training us to spy on each other, don't trust other citizens, just trust your great and all-powerful government that cares so much about you.
[00:35:20.736 --> 00:35:23.457]  Now, getting into other important stacks of news.
[00:35:23.457 --> 00:35:30.899]  Coming up, House passes the repeal of the government healthcare takeover, but the problem is the Senate is set to block
[00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:33.700]  I want to get back into China.
[00:35:52.435 --> 00:35:56.398]  We're being told in our media that America is falling apart.
[00:35:56.398 --> 00:36:04.143]  America is going into a worse and worse economic atmosphere because we haven't accepted carbon taxes.
[00:36:04.143 --> 00:36:16.611]  That's like saying if you've been shot in the chest with a shotgun but are still barely alive, the reason that you're in critical condition is because you weren't shot another time with the shotgun.
[00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:20.274]  Or that several more shotgun blasts at close range would probably help you.
[00:36:21.107 --> 00:36:28.371]  It's kind of like hammering nails and hitting your thumb and saying, well, the answer is just go ahead and hammer your hand full power.
[00:36:28.371 --> 00:36:31.233]  And it's never backed up by any facts or any research.
[00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:34.695]  Obviously, carbon taxes will shut our economy down even faster.
[00:36:34.695 --> 00:36:48.083]  And then I've got all these articles today, I'm going to dig through the stack and go over them, where there's all these statements by Democrats and NASA people and others about, well, China's doing so good because they've put in all the environmental standards and the carbon taxes.
[00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:49.164]  They've put in none of it!
[00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:56.064]  They're the ones that refused the Copenhagen Treaty in late 2009, now over a year ago.
[00:36:56.064 --> 00:37:03.446]  And that's all on record, it's just... There's just so much bald-faced lying going on.
[00:37:03.446 --> 00:37:05.206]  But I wanted to go over some of these articles.
[00:37:05.206 --> 00:37:08.087]  Obama, we welcome China's rise.
[00:37:08.087 --> 00:37:11.927]  But this is not a rise of the Chinese people who are incredibly oppressed.
[00:37:11.927 --> 00:37:14.188]  China holds the record for oppression, no one denies that.
[00:37:15.782 --> 00:37:28.465]  This is about the corrupt elite of China teaming up with the robber barons of the West to basically leverage their market control to destroy all their political and economic competitors and vertically integrate society.
[00:37:28.465 --> 00:37:33.327]  I mean, here's a disgusting article out of Time Magazine.
[00:37:33.327 --> 00:37:37.828]  Why China does capitalism better than the US?
[00:37:37.828 --> 00:37:41.309]  I remember a decade ago, the Chinese dictator at the time, the president at the time,
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:45.440]  I don't know.
[00:37:58.659 --> 00:38:01.542]  Where they destroy economies by design.
[00:38:01.542 --> 00:38:04.585]  They put regulations on their competition, but not on themselves.
[00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:06.147]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:38:06.147 --> 00:38:07.308]  It's not capitalism at all.
[00:38:07.308 --> 00:38:10.832]  It's just criminal mafia piracy.
[00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:13.114]  And that's what's happening in China.
[00:38:13.114 --> 00:38:20.382]  And they go through this gobbledygook about China responded properly to the economic crisis, but the Western world didn't.
[00:38:21.152 --> 00:38:24.375]  Well, China's already a wholly owned subsidiary of the central banks.
[00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:26.276]  It's an authoritarian system.
[00:38:26.276 --> 00:38:27.597]  The globalists love it.
[00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:28.698]  I mean, they praise it.
[00:38:28.698 --> 00:38:33.122]  David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, Prince Charles, the list goes on and on.
[00:38:33.122 --> 00:38:44.732]  They are selling authoritarianism here as the solution to all our problems when it's these authoritarians that have already hamstrung us financially so that we're beholden and under their control.
[00:38:44.732 --> 00:38:47.254]  I mean, it's so incredible.
[00:38:48.809 --> 00:39:02.922]  It's the tens and tens and tens and tens of trillions sucked out of Western coffers, then pumped into the private central banks who run our treasury departments worldwide to the G20, who said, we'll fix the economy if you give us more power.
[00:39:02.922 --> 00:39:07.566]  And then now things are accelerating in their decline, and their answer is, give us a hundred trillion more.
[00:39:07.566 --> 00:39:12.350]  I've got that in my economy stack today.
[00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.972]  Here's the Washington Times.
[00:39:17.082 --> 00:39:19.384]  China, US, number one, no more.
[00:39:19.384 --> 00:39:33.457]  And then they just go through statements by the Communist Party and links to just, it's gotta be more than 15 newspapers here where they're just talking about how we are a joke.
[00:39:33.457 --> 00:39:39.162]  And yeah, constantly I see the headlines out of China in the official government-run papers.
[00:39:40.162 --> 00:39:41.402]  Well, I guess they're all government-run.
[00:39:41.402 --> 00:39:49.564]  They reported last month that the only independent magazine in China was ordered shut down by the government.
[00:39:49.564 --> 00:40:00.107]  And then it's a dirty thing in our media when anybody asks the president about their, quote, human rights problem.
[00:40:00.107 --> 00:40:01.267]  Like it's a problem.
[00:40:01.267 --> 00:40:02.728]  This is their policy.
[00:40:02.728 --> 00:40:04.108]  This is what they intend to do.
[00:40:06.175 --> 00:40:11.276]  So it goes over all of that, and you've got these disgusting mainline liberals.
[00:40:11.276 --> 00:40:13.156]  This is out of a French news agency.
[00:40:13.156 --> 00:40:19.597]  Jackie Chan, Barbara Streisand, lead Hu Jintao state dinner guest.
[00:40:19.597 --> 00:40:25.098]  And it goes into how they praised him and how it was a star-studded lineup of liberals.
[00:40:25.098 --> 00:40:27.499]  Well, look at this article.
[00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:34.480]  I've got one here in the stack dealing with what's happening with Apple.
[00:40:36.855 --> 00:40:56.344]  Apple and its factories in China are, in every case I've seen, are the facilities, these giant factory cities, they're private complexes run by the government, with government backing, with government police in them, where they're having massive suicides every day.
[00:40:56.344 --> 00:41:02.167]  They had to put nets around them because the people would climb up on the roof and jump off head first trying to kill themselves.
[00:41:05.939 --> 00:41:16.385]  I've got the articles here, going to the stack I'm going to get to, where China, again, is being praised for accepting carbon taxes and environmental standards that we won't.
[00:41:16.385 --> 00:41:17.726]  That is a ridiculous hoax.
[00:41:17.726 --> 00:41:21.268]  That's like saying Godzilla is real and attacked Tokyo last week.
[00:41:21.268 --> 00:41:24.910]  I mean, it is a verifiable, absolute, bald-faced lie.
[00:41:25.854 --> 00:41:35.049]  But then, you see the truth occasionally rear its ugly head, but by individual Chinese citizens, who I'm sure will get arrested, or imprisoned, or sent to a re-education camp.
[00:41:35.049 --> 00:41:36.933]  Because you criticize things there, that's what happens.
[00:41:38.228 --> 00:41:51.811]  Again, Paul Watson's wife contributed to one article, she's Chinese, to one article and her family and people got threatened and she was told all the way into England, you better not write for Prison Planet anymore.
[00:41:51.811 --> 00:41:58.913]  And we're only one step away from that with Congressman Cohen running around on a witch hunt against Jesse Ventura, myself and others.
[00:41:58.913 --> 00:42:00.673]  He's getting shows pulled off television.
[00:42:04.815 --> 00:42:10.577]  And reportedly, they pulled the shows, you know, so that Homeland Security and Cohen wouldn't start demonizing them and attacking them.
[00:42:10.577 --> 00:42:14.178]  But of course, they went ahead and went after him anyways.
[00:42:14.178 --> 00:42:15.938]  I mean, that's where we're going here.
[00:42:15.938 --> 00:42:19.359]  Apple faces pollution storm in China.
[00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:21.320]  Well, I thought Apple's liberal.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.840]  I mean, they got Al Gore on their board.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:30.442]  They're always telling us how we got to shut down Texas power plants, how we got to, you know, pass carbon taxes that are paid to Al Gore and the IMF and World Bank.
[00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:36.210]  You look at the big carbon trading company in England, the biggest in the world, Rothschild owned.
[00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.871]  I looked up Sir James Wolftonson last night doing some research on him.
[00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:39.671]  I already knew it.
[00:42:39.671 --> 00:42:45.273]  But how he's named after James Rothschild and how he was born on Rothschild's birthday and all this weirdness.
[00:42:45.273 --> 00:42:46.953]  Now he works for the Rothschilds.
[00:42:46.953 --> 00:42:50.394]  That's who ran the World Bank for all those years.
[00:42:51.892 --> 00:42:56.038]  I mean it's disgusting to watch this mafia getting away with this.
[00:42:56.038 --> 00:43:06.471]  But then on a high horse telling us we can't collect rainwater and that I've got to pay a three plus billion dollar carbon tax living here in Austin over the next three years to these people.
[00:43:06.852 --> 00:43:10.894]  Yeah, they couldn't get Congress to pass it, so they're just coming in buying off the cities and doing it.
[00:43:10.894 --> 00:43:14.575]  Continuing, Apple faces pollution storm in China.
[00:43:14.575 --> 00:43:23.699]  A group of 36 Chinese environmental groups has accused Apple of failing to address concerns over pollution and worker health issues in factories supplying components for its gadgets.
[00:43:23.699 --> 00:43:26.200]  Yeah, the fumes, the toxic waste.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.842]  I mean, you look at photos of these people in their work in 16, 18 hours a day.
[00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:33.703]  Their children are taken from them and raised in government facilities.
[00:43:33.703 --> 00:43:34.803]  This is all on record.
[00:43:34.803 --> 00:43:36.204]  This is what Apple supports.
[00:43:37.256 --> 00:43:37.436]  I don't
[00:43:58.732 --> 00:44:03.035]  We're just pointing out that this is a monstrous, wicked company, just like Microsoft.
[00:44:03.035 --> 00:44:04.956]  And they always pose as liberals.
[00:44:04.956 --> 00:44:12.141]  Bill Gates says he's putting, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars of his and other people's money in this tax-free foundation to save the Earth.
[00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:15.303]  Those are businesses they run tax-free!
[00:44:15.303 --> 00:44:18.365]  Just like Obama's buddies are all exempt from the healthcare law.
[00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:19.586]  They don't have to buy the insurance.
[00:44:19.586 --> 00:44:20.587]  It's all fraud!
[00:44:31.696 --> 00:44:37.879]  And Jaren just walked in and gave me something that completely just completely blew me away.
[00:44:37.879 --> 00:44:45.023]  They have been quietly beta testing.
[00:44:45.023 --> 00:44:46.384]  I can hardly talk what I was just shown.
[00:44:48.826 --> 00:44:59.376]  It's just one more piece of the tens of thousands of pieces that totally confirms we're absolutely on target about everything we've said, except for the fact that it's worse than I could even imagine.
[00:44:59.376 --> 00:45:02.319]  Every night now, every morning, I am freaked out.
[00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:08.752]  When I'm eating breakfast with my children or drinking a cup of coffee or researching that this is so real.
[00:45:08.752 --> 00:45:11.633]  Every day I wake up at 6 a.m.
[00:45:11.633 --> 00:45:12.593]  or even earlier.
[00:45:12.593 --> 00:45:14.413]  Today I slept in late.
[00:45:14.413 --> 00:45:19.615]  I woke up at about 7.30 and I woke up in the bed with my children running into the room.
[00:45:19.615 --> 00:45:24.697]  I looked at how innocent and good they are and how they deserve a future of liberty and freedom.
[00:45:24.697 --> 00:45:27.978]  And I just said, God, I hope this country repents.
[00:45:27.978 --> 00:45:32.199]  When our government is openly embracing China, the most murderous government in history,
[00:45:33.314 --> 00:45:44.683]  And trying to spin it like it's good, and our media all over the place is telling us how China's great and how authoritarianism's kind of cool, and gets things done.
[00:45:44.683 --> 00:46:00.696]  China allows parents who aren't, they take the rural family's children and put them in these factories as young as 10, but in other cases, they just take people's children and chain them to light poles, and the police allow it, when they go to work, and the kid sits there for 14, 15, 16 hours, chained to a pole.
[00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:05.379]  No food, no nothing.
[00:46:05.379 --> 00:46:07.300]  And, you know, the father I saw on One Piece was interviewed.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.261]  He said, well, I've got to go work.
[00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:12.722]  You know, he pulls people in a hand-drawn taxi or there'll be no food.
[00:46:12.722 --> 00:46:18.745]  And he gets that money every night and runs and gets his son and goes back to his wife and they eat the food that the money bought.
[00:46:18.745 --> 00:46:22.047]  And they live in a shack by a toxic waste river.
[00:46:22.047 --> 00:46:23.348]  That was just one case.
[00:46:23.348 --> 00:46:27.130]  And then that's and that's what we're competing against.
[00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.630]  That's the lifting China up.
[00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.851]  It's actually brought China down.
[00:46:34.793 --> 00:46:38.035]  And then they praise China for its environmental standards.
[00:46:38.035 --> 00:46:55.524]  But when our government openly embraces tyranny, now worldwide, the push for homeland security, the push for checkpoints, the push for wireless wiretapping, warrantless wiretapping, that is now used, instead of America being that example of liberty, it's now the example of tyranny being good!
[00:46:55.524 --> 00:46:58.566]  And so is China!
[00:46:58.566 --> 00:47:02.148]  And I remember back to the Sandpoint Naval Brig,
[00:47:03.547 --> 00:47:07.891]  And I remember it was confirmed by local police in all three newspapers in Seattle.
[00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:12.635]  I'm about to get to the new news, it all ties together.
[00:47:12.635 --> 00:47:24.506]  I'm trying to bring you into my understanding, my worldview, so you can see the three-dimensional model and then integrate it yourself and then tie it into your own data you're picking up locally, so you understand how I think, how I understand all this.
[00:47:24.506 --> 00:47:28.710]  The minute Jaron brought this in and I just looked down at it, I'm not telling you what it is yet,
[00:47:29.781 --> 00:47:38.943]  It instantly caused an entire matrix grid of understanding with thousands of research data points historically and what's happening domestically.
[00:47:38.943 --> 00:47:46.064]  Army checkpoints we videotaped, pulling over buses and searching citizens 12 years ago, 13 years ago in Central Texas.
[00:47:46.064 --> 00:47:54.206]  Fake nuclear spills on I-35 we've witnessed and exposed to practice martial law takeover drills where they announce the nuclear spill is real.
[00:47:55.346 --> 00:48:16.188]  Homeland Security rolling out at shopping malls and Walmarts and citizen spy grids and professionals from dentists to managers to you name it I mean my own father and then he went in and told the other dentist about it and he said oh yeah they came to my house last week separately and tried to recruit me for Homeland Security.
[00:48:16.943 --> 00:48:18.384]  To spy on people.
[00:48:18.384 --> 00:48:20.646]  To spy on patients.
[00:48:20.646 --> 00:48:22.867]  I mean, it's just secret police are everywhere!
[00:48:22.867 --> 00:48:43.801]  They've built this giant army, this giant grid up, and it's all around us, ahead of the total collapse of our economy, and then they'll offer the solution of an authoritarian system in the United States as the answer, and a complete, top-down, engineered, managed economy.
[00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:45.042]  A command-and-control economy.
[00:48:46.169 --> 00:48:50.172]  But going back to Seattle.
[00:48:50.172 --> 00:48:56.057]  In Seattle, and I have this in police state to the takeover, clips from local news.
[00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:03.893]  The Pentagon sent in Delta Force.
[00:49:03.893 --> 00:49:08.318]  They met up with Ford Foundation, hired anarchists who knew they were hired.
[00:49:08.318 --> 00:49:10.161]  They were housed in a government building.
[00:49:10.161 --> 00:49:12.063]  They were protected by the police.
[00:49:12.063 --> 00:49:16.369]  They went out and attacked the police, other police that weren't aware of the operation.
[00:49:16.369 --> 00:49:17.751]  Those police were told to stand down.
[00:49:17.751 --> 00:49:18.432]  It's all on video.
[00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:20.439]  Yeah.
[00:49:36.872 --> 00:49:55.375]  The military, the state police, the police from all over the state, the Seattle police, on the 60,000 peaceful demonstrators, and routed them even into neighborhoods, running up and savagely beating even old women, young women, men, pulling cars over randomly, dragging women out, spraying pepper spray on them.
[00:49:55.375 --> 00:50:00.436]  It was a police riot that the social engineers had triggered.
[00:50:00.436 --> 00:50:04.777]  And it later all came out in the news, and I have it in police state too, the takeover.
[00:50:08.015 --> 00:50:09.858]  Give me some background here.
[00:50:09.858 --> 00:50:13.263]  Then I send my crew to the G20.
[00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:23.489]  Over a year ago now, it's in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA, I sent them to Pittsburgh, and more than half the city is off-limits to even be out and shop.
[00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:29.270]  We have footage of old ladies coming out of a grocery store with bags, and a police dog attacks them, and the women say, we're shopping!
[00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.270]  And they say, no one allowed!
[00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:40.252]  Footage of armored vehicles driving through neighborhoods, kids playing with footballs, and broadcasting, go in your houses now or we're gonna hit you with sound cannons.
[00:50:40.252 --> 00:50:41.572]  Hired provocateurs again.
[00:50:43.953 --> 00:50:54.144]  They admit under the Emergency Centers Act they're going to use military bases to hold people, and when they arrested Rob Dew, Luke Radowsky, and others, they took them to a military base.
[00:50:54.144 --> 00:50:58.088]  Guess where they're taking the 100 mafia people?
[00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:59.109]  To a military base.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.541]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:08.124]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:08.124 --> 00:51:13.146]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:13.146 --> 00:51:13.626]  It's true.
[00:51:13.626 --> 00:51:18.169]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:23.931]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:31.053]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:31.053 --> 00:51:32.173]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:32.173 --> 00:51:38.515]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:51:42.037 --> 00:51:44.258]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:51:45.398 --> 00:51:48.840]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.581]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.894 --> 00:52:03.216]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.216 --> 00:52:05.597]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.597 --> 00:52:08.819]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.819 --> 00:52:13.922]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:18.105]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.425 --> 00:52:20.766]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.766 --> 00:52:23.647]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.647 --> 00:52:26.569]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:34.172]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.505 --> 00:52:39.890]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.753]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.753 --> 00:52:46.437]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.437 --> 00:52:47.518]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.518 --> 00:52:48.859]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.859 --> 00:52:50.360]  Invisible Empire.

[00:54:19.158 --> 00:54:22.760]  What's happening is they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:30.425]  They were going to implode the United States, Greece, Ireland, the rest of Europe in a coordinated global operation.
[00:54:30.425 --> 00:54:33.567]  But they had to put the police state grid in place.
[00:54:33.567 --> 00:54:38.590]  And that's why the RAND Corporation and others in 99 said, we're moving into a police state.
[00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.371]  This is how we're going to federalize police.
[00:54:40.371 --> 00:54:41.331]  They published it all.
[00:54:41.331 --> 00:54:41.912]  We've shown you.
[00:54:42.532 --> 00:54:51.615]  The command set up under federal control for small towns, medium towns, cities, large cities, metropolis.
[00:54:51.615 --> 00:54:53.075]  It's all there.
[00:54:53.075 --> 00:54:57.537]  We have their complete program.
[00:54:57.537 --> 00:55:01.598]  And it literally staggers me to see this happening.
[00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:11.721]  And to now have this background of Congressman Cohen and countless others calling for restrictions on free speech, saying we need a driver's license to get on the Internet, Internet ID.
[00:55:13.183 --> 00:55:15.365]  We need a speed limit on speech.
[00:55:15.365 --> 00:55:18.168]  There needs to be prior constraint on speech.
[00:55:18.168 --> 00:55:22.953]  The government wants to be able, under cybersecurity, to put announcements on everyone's websites.
[00:55:22.953 --> 00:55:28.058]  It's an overlay through your ISP, like a forced pop-up to counter information you're putting out.
[00:55:28.678 --> 00:55:31.019]  Cass Sunstein's talked about arresting people.
[00:55:31.019 --> 00:55:35.700]  He's the White House regulations are that deny global warming or talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:42.162]  I mean do you want this is real authoritarianism and a high-tech version and we've got multiple articles on this.
[00:55:42.162 --> 00:55:44.442]  Biggest mafia bust in New York City history.
[00:55:44.442 --> 00:55:45.343]  Videos of arrests.
[00:55:45.343 --> 00:55:53.445]  The Examiner has this and at the end there's a little blurb quoting NBC and the New York Daily News.
[00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:57.298]  So this is New York Daily News, the original source of this.
[00:55:57.298 --> 00:56:03.819]  The defendants are being held in the brig at Fort Hamilton, an army post in Brooklyn.
[00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:10.261]  So, they held them at the, quote, FEMA Center, that's on the news, in 99 in Seattle.
[00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:21.404]  They held Luke Radowsky, Rob Dew, and others, and they would bring people in on trucks, with the army, with the police, and they had some people with bags over their heads like they were Al Qaeda.
[00:56:24.358 --> 00:56:33.943]  And they're just acclimating everyone, and that's what the Emergency Centers Act says, is we'll use military bases for any type of emergency, including civil unrest.
[00:56:33.943 --> 00:56:41.026]  They're gearing up to literally go door-to-door with army trucks, and take you out, and put you in it, and you disappear!
[00:56:41.026 --> 00:56:46.069]  And this is so brazen, so illegal, so tyrannical, so wicked.
[00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:49.070]  We openly have foreign banks looting us.
[00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:51.531]  Four-plus trillion now missing from the Pentagon.
[00:56:51.531 --> 00:56:52.672]  Open crime.
[00:56:54.238 --> 00:57:04.088]  And they're coming in, and they're putting up Homeland Security signs everywhere, and they're recruiting citizens everywhere, and they are creating block captains everywhere to spy on their neighbors.
[00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:06.190]  I mean, they're really going to do this.
[00:57:07.537 --> 00:57:09.299]  They've committed such huge crimes.
[00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:10.660]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:14.003]  The average person over the years on the street or whatever says, why do I care?
[00:57:14.003 --> 00:57:15.084]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:57:15.084 --> 00:57:16.325]  You know, I'm just a professor.
[00:57:16.325 --> 00:57:17.226]  I'm just a school teacher.
[00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:18.207]  I'm just a lawyer.
[00:57:18.207 --> 00:57:22.331]  You know, I just go watch football and come home at six o'clock every night.
[00:57:22.331 --> 00:57:23.992]  Alex, you can fight tyranny all you want.
[00:57:23.992 --> 00:57:24.833]  Why should I care?
[00:57:24.833 --> 00:57:26.875]  Because the tyranny's for you, bozo.
[00:57:27.896 --> 00:57:28.796]  You understand that?
[00:57:28.796 --> 00:57:39.399]  The tyranny is for... All these police officers, all these military people, they're all destroying their own country, but they're doing it through ignorance because it's slowly, incrementally done.
[00:57:39.399 --> 00:57:52.021]  And then we dare put out an hour-long TV show detailing the Threat Fusion Centers, the 10 FEMA governors, the Marshall Law Plan, the Emergency Centers Act, and they go ape and have it pulled.
[00:57:52.021 --> 00:57:54.562]  Another indicator of how deep we are into this.
[00:57:55.526 --> 00:58:02.730]  New York Daily News reporting, the defendants are being held in the brig at Fort Hamilton, an army post in Brooklyn.
[00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.631]  1937 headline.
[00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:10.874]  The local Jews from the town are being held at the local army depot.
[00:58:10.874 --> 00:58:19.739]  When your army, that you supposedly defend your country, starts being used and trained to engage citizens, that's called tyranny.
[00:58:19.739 --> 00:58:21.080]  That's called banana republic.
[00:58:24.076 --> 00:58:25.437]  Oh man, I tell you what.
[00:58:25.437 --> 00:58:26.857]  New York Daily News.
[00:58:26.857 --> 00:58:33.561]  I mean, do you see what's happening in our media and putting Chinese flags up in D.C.?
[00:58:33.561 --> 00:58:41.425]  This is a soft power coup over America of the offshore banks and their muscle is our military, our police, and the Communist Chinese.
[00:58:41.425 --> 00:58:50.109]  On air, online, and on demand, we are the GCN Radio Network.

[00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:56.385]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.385 --> 00:59:59.187]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:10.622]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.622 --> 01:00:12.204]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.204 --> 01:00:13.765]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.765 --> 01:00:17.948]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:22.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.737 --> 01:00:30.838]  We have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us in 30 minutes.
[01:00:30.838 --> 01:00:32.719]  33 minutes to be precise.
[01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:36.139]  Dealing with Governor Abercrombie and his strange statements out of Hawaii.
[01:00:36.139 --> 01:00:37.580]  Dealing with Obama's birth certificate.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:45.241]  We're going to have open phones coming up and a lot of important news in the third hour today.
[01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:53.703]  Coming up in the next segment, Anderson Cooper versus Congressman Cohen debate is comparing Republicans to Nazis out of line.
[01:00:56.375 --> 01:01:02.916]  And they're basically trying to imply that the shooting in Arizona is still caused by Republicans and by free speech.
[01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:09.037]  And they go on to attack True TV and the show, one of the big shows I appeared in, the police aid episode that I consulted on.
[01:01:09.037 --> 01:01:16.559]  Of course, our footage of the FEMA Center with the kids in it, the Model States Emergency Powers Act, the Emergency Centers Act.
[01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:18.279]  We're going to comment on that.
[01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:21.659]  There's so many levels to this coming up.
[01:01:21.659 --> 01:01:23.360]  But we have an examiner report here.
[01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:32.234]  The defendants are being held at the brig in Fort Hamilton, an army post in Brooklyn.
[01:01:32.234 --> 01:01:42.118]  And we're continuing to look into that, but we see this happening over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:52.603]  Where they're got the, a lot of times the threat fusion centers now aren't just federalized with CIA involved, tied into all the surveillance cameras and the face scanning cameras and the license plate reading cameras.
[01:01:52.603 --> 01:01:53.063]  But now,
[01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:57.581]  They will move him in with the old National Guard base that was, quote, shut down.
[01:01:57.581 --> 01:02:00.323]  And then, oh, now we're going to augment you with regular army.
[01:02:01.178 --> 01:02:07.143]  And they have the National Guard helping in drug interdiction all over the country with their helicopters and now ground police.
[01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:19.874]  And then we have in New York, upstate, the news articles about the National Guard helped arrest 2,000 people for gun and drug charges at checkpoints where they have x-ray scanners scanning people's cars.
[01:02:19.874 --> 01:02:21.256]  They're just rolling it out.
[01:02:21.256 --> 01:02:24.699]  And the Marines running checkpoints in Central California.
[01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.816]  Looking for drunk drivers, off base, citizens, pulling U.S.
[01:02:29.816 --> 01:02:30.756]  citizens over.
[01:02:30.756 --> 01:02:36.397]  They're just training local police and local governments everywhere with Army drills, Marine Corps drills.
[01:02:36.397 --> 01:02:50.800]  They're training the military, the police, the citizens, the media, all of us to acclimate us and condition us and prepare our minds to accept this.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.920]  And to see our country sliding into this, it just,
[01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:55.554]  Really makes me sad.
[01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:57.581]  I grieve for our nation.
[01:02:57.581 --> 01:02:58.885]  I mourn for our nation.
[01:02:59.994 --> 01:03:04.375]  You think the banks are going to stop at stealing $28 trillion in the last two years and not telling Congress where the money went?
[01:03:04.375 --> 01:03:06.735]  You think they're going to stop with killing a million Iraqis?
[01:03:06.735 --> 01:03:13.177]  You think they're going to stop with drone attacks every day at weddings, killing whole groups of people in Afghanistan and Pakistan?
[01:03:13.177 --> 01:03:14.357]  You think they're going to stop?
[01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:17.738]  You think the globalists care about you any more than they care about an Iraqi?
[01:03:17.738 --> 01:03:20.498]  We have to repent, especially mainline conservatives.
[01:03:20.498 --> 01:03:22.599]  I never supported any of the wars or anything.
[01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:28.720]  But the point is, those of you out there who I know aren't bad people, who got sucked into this war fever, you got to repent for that.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:36.143]  Democrats have got to repent for the 51 million abortions.
[01:03:36.143 --> 01:03:45.186]  And even if we don't believe in God, we've got to recognize that we're not valuing human life, and that if we don't value other people's life, then how do we expect to have any due process?
[01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:49.908]  How do we expect to have any dignity, or honor, or safety, or liberty, or freedom?
[01:03:49.908 --> 01:03:56.870]  How do we expect to have anything when our government embraces Communist China and puts their flags up down Pennsylvania Avenue and at the White House?
[01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:57.911]  Something never before done!
[01:04:00.694 --> 01:04:11.103]  How do you expect us to have any future when all these different shows on TV, fiction shows, glorify secret arrest, secret wiretapping, secret torture?
[01:04:11.103 --> 01:04:18.128]  And it's always done in a situational ethic where it's the right thing to do to torture.
[01:04:18.128 --> 01:04:20.130]  They're getting us ready.
[01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:26.676]  You think people dying almost every day from being electrocuted by tasers and other stun guns by the police for sometimes just
[01:04:28.317 --> 01:04:29.878]  Arguing a little bit.
[01:04:29.878 --> 01:04:31.679]  Do you think it's gonna stop there?
[01:04:31.679 --> 01:04:34.720]  Now they're upping the power of the tasers.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.702]  They're just getting everyone trained to accept this.
[01:04:38.702 --> 01:04:43.825]  It took Hitler seven years to really get Germany into a hardcore tyranny.
[01:04:43.825 --> 01:04:49.848]  And the globalists are doing it over several decades, but now we're reaching that quickening point, that acceleration point.
[01:04:50.964 --> 01:04:53.187]  Man, I'm shook up, I tell you.
[01:04:53.187 --> 01:05:01.036]  You know, I would think that I would be acclimated and prepared for this, but to see it unfolding, and it's just gonna get worse and worse until we say no.
[01:05:01.036 --> 01:05:05.582]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.582 --> 01:05:06.163]  Number one.
[01:05:06.483 --> 01:05:10.766]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:10.766 --> 01:05:15.650]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:16.410]  It's true.
[01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:22.095]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:22.095 --> 01:05:25.677]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.677 --> 01:05:29.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.380]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.141]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:36.822]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.822 --> 01:05:37.602]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.602 --> 01:05:41.763]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:46.805]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.805 --> 01:05:50.986]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.986 --> 01:05:52.767]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.767 --> 01:05:57.368]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:57.728]  877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.816 --> 01:06:04.658]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:06:04.658 --> 01:06:08.940]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:13.643]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:06:13.643 --> 01:06:19.586]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:06:19.586 --> 01:06:22.867]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:06:22.867 --> 01:06:26.589]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:06:29.524 --> 01:06:36.529]  We're American and be proud.
[01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:39.251]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:06:55.327 --> 01:07:00.868]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:07:00.868 --> 01:07:04.449]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:04.449 --> 01:07:05.749]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:05.749 --> 01:07:10.150]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:16.091]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:16.091 --> 01:07:18.231]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:18.231 --> 01:07:20.912]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:21.272 --> 01:07:27.778]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:07:27.778 --> 01:07:29.981]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:07:29.981 --> 01:07:35.326]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:35.326 --> 01:07:40.611]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:07:40.611 --> 01:07:45.796]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:07:45.976 --> 01:07:49.157]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:07:49.157 --> 01:07:52.158]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:52.158 --> 01:07:52.898]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:52.898 --> 01:07:55.819]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:55.819 --> 01:07:57.299]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.278 --> 01:08:26.006]  All over the nation, from Tennessee to California, from New York to Texas, they're having regular Army, regular Marines, Army National Guard, running checkpoints.
[01:08:26.006 --> 01:08:31.810]  Even when the governor, a year and a half ago, this is in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that seminal documentary that everyone must see.
[01:08:33.427 --> 01:08:40.193]  The governor, and we even had a state rep on about this, said stop having Homeland Security and the Army run random checkpoints on major highways.
[01:08:40.193 --> 01:08:42.496]  This is my state, you're freaking people out.
[01:08:42.496 --> 01:08:48.721]  They were going into small towns, big highways, shutting it down, searching everybody, video on the news.
[01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:52.405]  And Homeland Security said we're not going to stop, we're going to keep doing it.
[01:08:52.405 --> 01:08:57.530]  And now all over the country, we showed you this last hour, they're putting up signs everywhere.
[01:08:58.638 --> 01:09:04.422]  In front of propane tanks that say, Homeland Security, you now can't park here at this 7-Eleven or this grocery store.
[01:09:04.422 --> 01:09:09.046]  You know, you pull up at the grocery store or the 7-Eleven, they got the propane tanks.
[01:09:09.046 --> 01:09:10.907]  It's saying, Homeland Security says can't park here.
[01:09:10.907 --> 01:09:12.808]  It's like federal zoning.
[01:09:12.808 --> 01:09:16.131]  It's a federal power grab outside of their jurisdiction.
[01:09:17.466 --> 01:09:26.068]  And yesterday they had all these fake scares with fake pipe bombs everywhere that they blow up to get rid of the evidence and so many times it comes out at stage part of a drill.
[01:09:26.068 --> 01:09:34.471]  I have caught the state police with Homeland Security before it was even called Homeland Security via FEMA staging fake nuclear spills and telling people they were real.
[01:09:36.232 --> 01:09:45.295]  In 98, 99, 2000, this is their program to smokescreen their federal takeover ahead of the admissions that were going into a full collapse.
[01:09:45.295 --> 01:09:52.317]  We have the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act admitting plans for forced inoculations nationwide.
[01:09:52.317 --> 01:10:01.880]  In the film Enemy of the State that we sell at Infowars.com, they have interviews with the law enforcement people who were trained to take you forcibly to a sports stadium and inoculate you.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.941]  But this is all admitted!
[01:10:03.948 --> 01:10:06.822]  One thing to have the documents that are public, but another thing to have the people that were trained for it.
[01:10:07.554 --> 01:10:12.675]  They're training the military, and every time they have a crisis, they use it as an excuse to confiscate guns.
[01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:34.501]  I had the Army Colonel on, that's also in Police State 4, last year, who openly admitted in Arcadia, Iowa, they went and asked the local gun dealer to play the part of a right-winger who wouldn't turn his guns in, and they got the citizens in the town of 600 to allow door-to-door gun confiscation drills, where the police came in and simulated taking their guns with the military.
[01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.832]  And there's hundreds and hundreds of other cases.
[01:10:37.832 --> 01:10:43.274]  I've made four police state films just replete with footage of it, much of which I shot.
[01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:58.420]  Footage where Marines walk up in the middle of Hebron, Maryland, a small Mayberry town, and say, turn your camera off, you're not going to videotape this, because they were going in houses to do simulated gun confiscations, and they do the drills and say it's for America.
[01:11:00.862 --> 01:11:19.316]  I was there in 99 in Operation Urban Warrior with 2,000 Marines, thousands of other foreign troops, Dutch, German, British, Australian, Israeli, French, at the local university with role players from the university, screaming, I'm an American, please don't knock the camp, with the military admitting to me in interviews,
[01:11:20.558 --> 01:11:24.981]  The Marines, the Marine Colonel, that this was for America!
[01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:35.589]  Then I went home to the hotel that night, turned on CNN, who'd been there, and they said, training for Macedonia.
[01:11:35.589 --> 01:11:37.270]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:40.032]  They are doing this everywhere.
[01:11:40.032 --> 01:11:40.693]  Oh, man.
[01:11:43.285 --> 01:11:51.714]  When they enroll people in Fallujah, Iraq, or in Bagram, Afghanistan, on record, it's MIT government-designed face scanning.
[01:11:51.714 --> 01:11:57.840]  They stop everybody at checkpoints, get their names, put them into it, take the men in for a week or so, interrogate them in a FEMA camp.
[01:11:59.388 --> 01:12:16.923]  Turn them loose, and I've got Tom Brokaw on video, it was his last week on air, I've got him on VHS, I've played it here, I've got it somewhere around the office, where he said, in Iraq, outside Fallujah, if you're caught without your biometric ID card once you've been put in this, you are killed on the spot.
[01:12:16.923 --> 01:12:21.387]  And they're now bringing those troops back here to be police officers, who, okay, you don't have your ID?
[01:12:21.387 --> 01:12:23.909]  Take them over here to a ditch, and they shoot them and put them in a ditch.
[01:12:25.484 --> 01:12:29.428]  I remember Private Gruckheimer in Ithaca News in Afghanistan.
[01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.351]  He came back and he said, yeah, you know, we took out the terrorists.
[01:12:32.351 --> 01:12:35.795]  We'd go into entire villages and kill men, women, and children, including babies.
[01:12:35.795 --> 01:12:39.900]  And then Fox News responded with an army general saying, well, let's be clear.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.882]  Only in certain villages do we kill everyone.
[01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:44.705]  They don't even deny it.
[01:12:44.705 --> 01:12:47.686]  I mean, they have forged an army of Satan.
[01:12:47.686 --> 01:12:53.108]  And if we don't admit that our military has been taken over... Am I saying the German people were inherently bad?
[01:12:53.108 --> 01:12:58.370]  Am I saying the German Weimar Republic was completely evil?
[01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:59.710]  No.
[01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:02.151]  They were taken over and turned into agents of evil.
[01:13:03.348 --> 01:13:05.009]  And that's why the Germans went ahead and followed orders.
[01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:08.030]  Well, I can't say no to the military, I gotta support the troops.
[01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:10.211]  This is what happens in a tyranny.
[01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:12.672]  And the good news is we've reached out to the military and police.
[01:13:12.672 --> 01:13:16.593]  They're really waking up, but we need to have them wake up even faster.
[01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:28.318]  And here it is, I have the Daily Mail, the Examiner, and other reports confirming that they are being held at the Army base.
[01:13:28.318 --> 01:13:30.559]  My crew has been held at an Army base in Pittsburgh.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.900]  Under FEMA, for no reason.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.840]  It's all on footage.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.601]  We even sent the footage to lawyers that are part of a class action suit.
[01:13:41.601 --> 01:13:42.981]  Due's footage is key.
[01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:49.703]  Due's up on a hillside showing the troops come in, the National Guard and the police, to the university.
[01:13:49.703 --> 01:13:52.363]  Everyone followed orders, basically, and would not be on the streets at night.
[01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:53.963]  They were told, don't be on the streets.
[01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:54.603]  You're not allowed to be.
[01:13:54.603 --> 01:14:01.605]  So they said, where can we find people that'll be out at night so we can get some training on citizens, get our dogs a taste of American blood?
[01:14:01.605 --> 01:14:03.525]  And they said, well, let's go on over to the university.
[01:14:04.423 --> 01:14:06.243]  And so there's the park.
[01:14:06.243 --> 01:14:10.985]  The university people are out there, you know, eating pizza and listening to music by the hundreds.
[01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:12.465]  There's dorms all around it.
[01:14:12.465 --> 01:14:15.326]  The military even went into dorms arresting people.
[01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:23.268]  It was like Planet of the Apes, that scene where Heston and folks are, you know, running away from the apes with the primitive humans being hit over the head and grabbed in nets.
[01:14:23.268 --> 01:14:24.228]  I mean, that's the footage.
[01:14:24.228 --> 01:14:27.549]  Then they march up the hill to do, and they just look at him with pure hate.
[01:14:28.109 --> 01:14:29.829]  And they're like, who are you?
[01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:30.910]  Well, I'm media.
[01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:31.790]  Where's your ID?
[01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:33.830]  You don't have a pass to be part of the G20.
[01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:35.371]  G20 is like five miles away.
[01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:37.771]  And Duce says, well, no, I'm just here.
[01:14:37.771 --> 01:14:40.192]  And they said, put your camera on the ground.
[01:14:40.192 --> 01:14:43.532]  They put him in handcuffs, put everybody else in handcuffs, take them to a military base.
[01:14:43.532 --> 01:14:47.633]  And he said those police and military were just pure hate.
[01:14:47.633 --> 01:14:54.895]  And just like, they would take people and take them to the porta potty inside the base and then look at them and laugh at their genitals.
[01:14:55.819 --> 01:15:02.043]  I mean, it was just like one inch away from full-bore concentration camp.
[01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:05.826]  And then we get the Model States Emergency Powers Act.
[01:15:05.826 --> 01:15:07.527]  We get the FEMA Public Plans.
[01:15:07.527 --> 01:15:10.369]  We get the Emergency Centers Act.
[01:15:10.369 --> 01:15:14.492]  And it's everything that we reverse-engineered from all the other operations we covered.
[01:15:14.492 --> 01:15:19.715]  How they're going to build these giant centers outside every major city, and they've already got them in place.
[01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.096]  Twelve years ago, they had the old
[01:15:23.956 --> 01:15:30.862]  Airport, that's in Police State 2 The Takeover, where the local news admits, yes, it's used to hold citizens during civil unrest, where they chain you down to the floor.
[01:15:30.862 --> 01:15:34.605]  Pier 57 during the 2004 Republican Convention.
[01:15:34.605 --> 01:15:37.748]  I've gotten all this on tape.
[01:15:37.748 --> 01:15:43.452]  Taking peaceful people there, no Miranda, no nothing, chaining them down.
[01:15:43.452 --> 01:15:50.838]  And how they're going to introduce this to society through the threat fusion centers that are the spy federal command bases for the roundups.
[01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:51.079]  Then,
[01:15:52.574 --> 01:16:04.529]  We put all this in an hour special, it gets top ratings on TruTV, and Homeland Security, ADL, and Congressman Cohen, behind the scenes, start demanding it be taken off the air.
[01:16:04.529 --> 01:16:05.850]  It's pulled off the air.
[01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:07.172]  Now they're pulling more of it off the air.
[01:16:07.172 --> 01:16:10.356]  Now they're remote erasing it off DVRs in your house.
[01:16:10.356 --> 01:16:11.077]  That's confirmed.
[01:16:14.548 --> 01:16:15.549]  And what does Cohen say?
[01:16:15.549 --> 01:16:25.001]  He's out there calling Republicans Nazis and saying that anybody who criticizes government caused the shooting when it's admitted it was nothing but mental illness and the guy was anything a liberal.
[01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:27.209]  That's what all his friends and everybody said.
[01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:29.470]  That doesn't blame Democrats.
[01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:33.411]  And this is the guy right here, instrumental in getting that pulled off TV.
[01:16:33.411 --> 01:16:35.372]  This guy would love to live in China.
[01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:37.852]  Here he is with Anderson's CIA Cooper.
[01:16:37.852 --> 01:16:39.193]  Here it is.
[01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:49.696]  Cohen, how can you think that it's appropriate for a member of Congress on the floor of the House to compare the statements made by Republicans about health care to lies about Jews told by Joseph Goebbels and other Nazis?
[01:16:49.696 --> 01:16:50.496]  How is that appropriate?
[01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.637]  Well, probably because it was the same process.
[01:16:52.637 --> 01:16:54.898]  Obviously, I don't think Republicans are Nazis.
[01:16:54.898 --> 01:17:01.941]  But they used the same means that Goebbels used, which was to have a short, concise idea and repeat it over and over and over again.
[01:17:01.941 --> 01:17:03.641]  But you're essentially comparing them to Nazis.
[01:17:03.641 --> 01:17:05.722]  No, I don't think I was, and I certainly didn't intend to.
[01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:12.485]  And when you do an open session like that on the floor, you speak off the cuff.
[01:17:12.485 --> 01:17:15.006]  Now, Goebbels was the master of political propaganda.
[01:17:15.666 --> 01:17:30.790]  And as evil a man as he was, he was the master of this, and when people use it and use lies over and over and over again, whether it's killing grandma, whether it's government takeover of health care, or any of those things, somebody has to stand up and say, hey, wait a minute, why?
[01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:33.793]  If you weren't trying to compare them to Nazis, you wouldn't have mentioned Nazis.
[01:17:33.793 --> 01:17:38.259]  I mean, you said their statements on healthcare are the same kind of lies that Nazis told.
[01:17:38.259 --> 01:17:39.240]  I didn't say Nazis.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.321]  I said... You said Goebbels.
[01:17:40.321 --> 01:17:42.624]  He's the chief propagandist for the Nazi party.
[01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:42.984]  He was.
[01:17:42.984 --> 01:17:46.508]  And you said the Germans told lies about the Jews and that led to the Holocaust.
[01:17:46.508 --> 01:17:49.292]  You're saying they're doing the same kind of thing that the Nazis did.
[01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:50.073]  That's comparing them.
[01:17:50.509 --> 01:17:52.011]  Well, I didn't intend to do that.
[01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:52.852]  I didn't think I did.
[01:17:52.852 --> 01:17:55.175]  He is the master political propagandist.
[01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:57.017]  He wrote treatises on it.
[01:17:57.017 --> 01:17:58.098]  He had rules.
[01:17:58.098 --> 01:17:59.219]  He is the major person.
[01:17:59.219 --> 01:18:06.028]  If you want to talk about political propaganda, the person you talk about who mastered it in terms of the big lie was Goebbels.
[01:18:06.028 --> 01:18:07.009]  So you're standing by this?
[01:18:07.009 --> 01:18:08.410]  You don't think it's inappropriate in any way?
[01:18:09.161 --> 01:18:15.407]  Well, I think as far as a lie goes, and I've been writing about lies in the political spectrum for the last two months.
[01:18:15.407 --> 01:18:21.993]  There was a show that said that the government was creating concentration camps and planned to have a pandemic against its citizens.
[01:18:21.993 --> 01:18:23.754]  This was something on True TV.
[01:18:23.754 --> 01:18:27.478]  Yeah, that's Jesse Ventura's ridiculous conspiracy show, which is a joke.
[01:18:27.478 --> 01:18:28.639]  It's not a joke.
[01:18:28.639 --> 01:18:29.700]  I wrote an op-ed about it.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.123]  That's the kind of stuff that produces Oklahoma City's produced two deputy
[01:18:33.203 --> 01:18:33.443]  I think so.
[01:18:49.648 --> 01:19:01.131]  And if you wanted to talk about some monster scientist, and you mentioned Mingela, it would be appropriate, because he was the monster scientist of the last hundred years, or maybe of all time.
[01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:01.791]  Okay.
[01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:12.214]  Yeah, and Mr. Steve Cohen, Congressman, it's now even come out in the New York Times, what we knew decades ago, that our government took tens of thousands of top Nazis, including Mingela, and protected them.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.246]  Oh, but you don't want to talk about that.
[01:19:16.246 --> 01:19:23.940]  You want to take a show like Ventura's and imply, or no, he didn't imply, he said that causes Oklahoma cities and police being killed.
[01:19:26.104 --> 01:19:28.326]  They go and interview the heads of threat fusion centers.
[01:19:28.326 --> 01:19:35.173]  They go and interview former, you know, top FBI agent who got out over it and works for the ACLU, exposing it.
[01:19:35.173 --> 01:19:44.002]  They went and interviewed, I mean, they went and showed the, they went to that congressman and showed him his own bill and he denied he'd even introduced it and then later had to admit it.
[01:19:44.002 --> 01:19:47.806]  Or the FEMA camps in America that are already built, they're just saying fund them more.
[01:19:49.079 --> 01:19:51.263]  I mean, it's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:19:51.263 --> 01:19:53.486]  They've got a massive civil unrest roundup planned.
[01:19:53.486 --> 01:19:55.589]  And they're just getting everybody used to it.
[01:19:55.589 --> 01:19:58.634]  You know, Hitler first put the Jews in the camps, then he put others.
[01:19:58.634 --> 01:20:00.657]  Now they're putting the Mafia in camps, then it's others.
[01:20:02.389 --> 01:20:05.232]  New Year, new way to smoke, and it's Totally Wicked!

[01:21:00.996 --> 01:21:07.678]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:21:07.678 --> 01:21:15.780]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:23.622]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:23.942 --> 01:21:29.043]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:29.043 --> 01:21:34.264]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:38.605]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:38.605 --> 01:21:39.685]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:39.685 --> 01:21:44.206]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:44.206 --> 01:21:49.087]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:49.087 --> 01:21:51.608]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:52.088 --> 01:21:53.852]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.852 --> 01:21:54.093]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.354 --> 01:22:05.378]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:08.621]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:08.621 --> 01:22:13.425]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:13.425 --> 01:22:19.831]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:19.831 --> 01:22:22.074]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:22:22.614 --> 01:22:23.594]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:23.594 --> 01:22:24.375]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:25.815]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.502 --> 01:22:48.786]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:22:48.786 --> 01:22:57.891]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:22:59.901 --> 01:23:04.005]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:04.005 --> 01:23:08.509]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:08.509 --> 01:23:14.675]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:14.675 --> 01:23:17.097]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:17.097 --> 01:23:23.083]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:23.183 --> 01:23:26.587]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:26.587 --> 01:23:28.469]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:23:28.469 --> 01:23:30.652]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:23:30.652 --> 01:23:35.517]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:23:35.517 --> 01:23:36.338]  Guaranteed.
[01:23:36.338 --> 01:23:40.403]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:23:40.623 --> 01:23:48.665]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:23:48.665 --> 01:23:49.405]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:23:49.405 --> 01:23:50.226]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:24:16.712 --> 01:24:30.100]  So, Congressman Cohen, Steve Cohen, tells us there's no police state, and everybody sees it unfolding with the telescreens going in, Homeland Security announcing the takeover of society.
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.522]  He and others have been calling for restrictions on free speech.
[01:24:32.522 --> 01:24:39.686]  Thank gosh Lieberman is retiring, a guy that's openly called for restricting free speech in this country, along with Senator Rockefeller and others.
[01:24:43.035 --> 01:24:50.859]  This is just a few minutes from the censored, banned, memory hold, police state episode that explains it all.
[01:24:50.859 --> 01:24:52.319]  The 10 FEMA Regents.
[01:24:52.319 --> 01:24:56.181]  And Ventura ends it with, you thought your Congress was running things?
[01:24:56.181 --> 01:24:57.862]  No, there are 10 governors that run it.
[01:24:57.862 --> 01:25:01.583]  That's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act that I freaked out about.
[01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:07.046]  It says 10 governors will control all the other states and will take over states if they don't follow federal orders.
[01:25:07.566 --> 01:25:09.587]  What do you think the EPA is doing in Texas?
[01:25:09.587 --> 01:25:20.069]  They can't get Congress to pass the carbon taxes, so they've come down here and regulatorily seize, with no law, our power plants that power five surrounding states!
[01:25:20.069 --> 01:25:26.251]  Texas is the number one power producer in North America!
[01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:27.671]  This is brazen!
[01:25:27.671 --> 01:25:35.833]  It's dictatorship when Obama can give exemptions to all the big companies like McDonald's that give him money from not having to buy insurance for their employees.
[01:25:36.937 --> 01:25:44.860]  Or, it came out that companies that didn't give money, people that own dealerships, GM dealerships that didn't give money to the Democrats, had them shut down!
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.561]  Had them given to Democratic friends!
[01:25:46.561 --> 01:25:48.822]  That's like Roman Caesars would do!
[01:25:48.822 --> 01:25:51.763]  And I could go for 10 hours with examples!
[01:25:51.763 --> 01:26:01.047]  Let's get to the Ventura clip of this censor, Cohen, this guy who thinks he controls your television set now, and I guess he does, who's up there saying this is going to cause a new Oklahoma City.
[01:26:01.047 --> 01:26:01.367]  Here it is.
[01:26:08.357 --> 01:26:12.571]  Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee agreed to talk about the bill.
[01:26:12.571 --> 01:26:14.677]  Remember, he's a co-sponsor.
[01:26:15.982 --> 01:26:18.963]  I'm here to talk to you about these FEMA camps.
[01:26:18.963 --> 01:26:20.543]  I'm very disturbed about them.
[01:26:20.543 --> 01:26:23.344]  Why would we be building these things all over the country?
[01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.605]  For what purpose?
[01:26:24.605 --> 01:26:27.825]  Well, we wouldn't, because they don't exist.
[01:26:27.825 --> 01:26:38.869]  It's just a figment of some people who have concerns about maybe Martians or other creatures coming to infiltrate our society, thinking that there are such camps.
[01:26:38.869 --> 01:26:40.809]  So why was it put into that bill?
[01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:46.874]  It's in a bill, so it's put into the bill.
[01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:47.594]  It doesn't exist.
[01:26:47.594 --> 01:26:50.137]  There are no FEMA camps anywhere in America.
[01:26:50.137 --> 01:26:51.599]  No, there aren't.
[01:26:51.599 --> 01:26:54.582]  What was the place I saw in Texas?
[01:26:54.582 --> 01:26:56.464]  It was called a residence.
[01:26:56.464 --> 01:26:59.286]  It had two 20-foot high fences around it.
[01:27:00.127 --> 01:27:02.228]  When I knocked on the door, it was locked.
[01:27:02.228 --> 01:27:07.609]  When the people came to the door, no comment was the answer I got on any question.
[01:27:07.609 --> 01:27:12.351]  And what disturbed me the most about this place was in the back, it was like a daycare.
[01:27:12.351 --> 01:27:15.372]  There's slides and swings for children.
[01:27:15.372 --> 01:27:18.453]  And I said, do you keep children inside this place?
[01:27:18.453 --> 01:27:19.213]  No comment.
[01:27:19.213 --> 01:27:21.554]  Have you ever kept children in this place?
[01:27:21.554 --> 01:27:22.254]  No comment.
[01:27:22.854 --> 01:27:24.435]  I haven't been there, so I have no idea.
[01:27:24.435 --> 01:27:25.936]  Maybe they're immature people.
[01:27:25.936 --> 01:27:30.860]  So you're telling me there isn't one FEMA camp of these in the United States right now?
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.680]  There are not.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.062]  Why is it in that bill?
[01:27:34.062 --> 01:27:35.242]  What is exactly in the bill?
[01:27:35.242 --> 01:27:38.305]  Which talks about building FEMA camps, doesn't it?
[01:27:38.305 --> 01:27:40.266]  That particular bill that we're talking about?
[01:27:40.266 --> 01:27:45.249]  I would have to... I'd like to see the bill.
[01:27:45.249 --> 01:27:50.673]  Isn't this guy a co-sponsor of the bill?
[01:27:50.673 --> 01:27:51.513]  What's the bill number?
[01:27:53.622 --> 01:27:56.824]  Six FEMA camps to be built within the United States.
[01:27:56.824 --> 01:28:02.787]  How can a bill state that there'll be six FEMA camps built in the United States, and then I'm being told there are none?
[01:28:02.787 --> 01:28:13.272]  Well, I think, you know, I think I recall now something about this, and if I'm correct, I think those are locations for if there's a disaster like in Katrina.
[01:28:13.272 --> 01:28:14.193]  I think that's what it is.
[01:28:14.193 --> 01:28:18.875]  It's not any kind of a concentration camp or anything to round up citizens.
[01:28:18.875 --> 01:28:20.236]  He thinks that's what it is?
[01:28:21.196 --> 01:28:28.639]  The bill that he co-sponsored says the use of the camps will be determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.
[01:28:28.639 --> 01:28:30.380]  They can come and go as they please.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.480]  They won't be locked.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.782]  They can go in and out because the place I saw in Texas is locked.
[01:28:35.782 --> 01:28:37.803]  You can't go in and out of it.
[01:28:37.803 --> 01:28:38.603]  No comment.
[01:28:38.603 --> 01:28:41.424]  Well, it's probably not being used either for a couple of years.
[01:28:41.424 --> 01:28:45.226]  Well, we have films of children playing on the swings and the slides and stuff.
[01:28:45.686 --> 01:28:48.947]  And this one technically falls under Homeland Security.
[01:28:48.947 --> 01:28:49.887]  Well, I don't know.
[01:28:49.887 --> 01:28:53.908]  I haven't been there, and I don't know who the children are, and the children are probably very happy.
[01:28:53.908 --> 01:28:55.989]  Where have we heard that before?
[01:28:55.989 --> 01:29:07.491]  They're probably children of the people that manage the place I imagine, but they're not people that have been taken there, you know, by some green monsters and a machine.
[01:29:07.491 --> 01:29:13.033]  I have fear of my government, not green monsters and machines from outer space.
[01:29:13.033 --> 01:29:14.413]  I have enough fear from here.
[01:29:16.607 --> 01:29:20.330]  You can see how things work in Washington.
[01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:21.531]  Now think about that.
[01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:32.239]  Now this guy behind the scenes with Homeland Security and ADL pressure got that episode shut down and now they're shutting other episodes down and he's on TV comparing it to Hitler.
[01:29:34.386 --> 01:29:39.689]  And you've got the White House regulations are saying arrest people that criticize man-made global warming.
[01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:40.929]  Now is that tyranny?
[01:29:40.929 --> 01:29:43.891]  Is Chinese flags on Pennsylvania Avenue tyranny?
[01:29:43.891 --> 01:29:46.172]  Is China owning our debt tyranny?
[01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:51.634]  Is our media saying tyranny's good tyranny?
[01:29:51.634 --> 01:29:53.035]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.035 --> 01:29:55.556]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:58.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.363 --> 01:30:02.524]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:02.524 --> 01:30:09.447]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.447 --> 01:30:12.009]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:12.009 --> 01:30:17.391]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:17.391 --> 01:30:20.433]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:20.433 --> 01:30:22.494]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.734 --> 01:30:28.999]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.999 --> 01:30:32.361]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.361 --> 01:30:38.145]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:38.145 --> 01:30:39.786]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.786 --> 01:30:41.087]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:41.087 --> 01:30:43.769]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.769 --> 01:30:47.992]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:04.947]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.947 --> 01:32:05.867]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.867 --> 01:32:09.290]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:10.150]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:15.033]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.033 --> 01:32:15.774]  It's true.
[01:32:15.774 --> 01:32:20.657]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.657 --> 01:32:21.477]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.477 --> 01:32:25.060]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:28.762]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.962 --> 01:32:29.762]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.762 --> 01:32:32.523]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.523 --> 01:32:36.205]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.205 --> 01:32:36.985]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:41.147]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.147 --> 01:32:46.189]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:50.370]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:52.151]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:57.093 --> 01:32:59.195]  You can run on for a long time Run on for a long time
[01:33:20.296 --> 01:33:30.322]  If enough of us speak out, maybe next time we can talk some sense into our leaders before they sign on the dotted line.
[01:34:00.638 --> 01:34:04.941]  They said it couldn't happen here, but it already is happening.
[01:34:04.941 --> 01:34:11.886]  And we've already allowed our elected officials to break all kinds of laws designed to protect you and me.
[01:34:11.886 --> 01:34:14.608]  You thought we had 50 states?
[01:34:14.608 --> 01:34:15.288]  Nope.
[01:34:15.288 --> 01:34:19.972]  We've learned there's 10 sectors ruled by 10 people you didn't vote for.
[01:34:20.872 --> 01:34:22.975]  You support your local police?
[01:34:22.975 --> 01:34:27.039]  That's nothing, not when they've got the military ready to take over.
[01:34:27.039 --> 01:34:29.962]  You signed a petition outside the supermarket?
[01:34:29.962 --> 01:34:32.505]  Who knows what list you're on now?
[01:34:32.505 --> 01:34:35.248]  And what about all these detention centers?
[01:34:35.248 --> 01:34:39.272]  Why do you think the standard answer is, no comment?
[01:34:39.272 --> 01:34:40.374]  And here's what's worse.
[01:34:40.834 --> 01:34:44.079]  They're doing it all in the name of national security.
[01:34:44.079 --> 01:34:45.922]  Talk about the fear factor.
[01:34:45.922 --> 01:34:48.305]  I've said it before and I'll say it now.
[01:34:48.305 --> 01:34:51.831]  I'd rather face the dangers than lose my freedom.
[01:34:51.831 --> 01:34:55.016]  I'm Jesse Ventura and this is Conspiracy Theory.
[01:34:59.395 --> 01:35:06.919]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I have Dr. Jerome Korsion for the next 30 minutes or so to talk about the incredible headlines.
[01:35:06.919 --> 01:35:13.962]  Hawaii governor can't find Obama birth certificate, suggests controversy could hurt president's re-election chances.
[01:35:13.962 --> 01:35:15.303]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[01:35:15.303 --> 01:35:21.306]  Hawaiian governor claims record of Obama's birth exists in archives but can't produce the vital document.
[01:35:21.306 --> 01:35:26.489]  So he did this big throwing down the gauntlet a few weeks ago and now he can't produce it.
[01:35:27.009 --> 01:35:36.640]  And the man who has been tirelessly on this case, here's Media Matters, George Soros' mouthpiece, Corsi's pathological quest to prove Obama is Kenyan continues.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.906]  Well, he didn't really believe it years ago until he went to Kenya and they arrested him when he was trying to, or kidnapped him, basically detained him.
[01:35:43.707 --> 01:35:49.031]  And now he's certainly on to something, and we know he gave up his citizenship when he was in Indonesia.
[01:35:49.031 --> 01:35:49.812]  He lied about that.
[01:35:49.812 --> 01:35:52.614]  He lied about going to the mosque and being a Muslim.
[01:35:52.614 --> 01:35:55.777]  Not that it's bad that he's a Muslim, but why would he cover that up?
[01:35:55.777 --> 01:35:58.299]  But it's good that we have Dr. Corsi on.
[01:35:59.039 --> 01:36:07.727]  Because he is an expert, as I am as well, on the 10 FEMA regions, on the Emergency Centers Act, on the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:36:07.727 --> 01:36:11.250]  He wrote about it as a conservative and criticized it when Bush was in.
[01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:12.811]  He continues to.
[01:36:12.811 --> 01:36:23.201]  But the left controlling this country, by the same Wall Street interest, are accelerating homeland security at shopping malls, homeland security signs, telescreens, going up at
[01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:25.943]  9,000 malls and Walmarts.
[01:36:25.943 --> 01:36:27.804]  I mean, it's all happening.
[01:36:27.804 --> 01:36:42.976]  And now we have Congressman Steve Cohen calling Republicans Nazis, gerbils, and trying to say that it's their fault that this guy who, before he went completely schizophrenic, was a, quote, very liberal pothead.
[01:36:42.976 --> 01:36:46.378]  They are now trying to restrict free speech.
[01:36:46.378 --> 01:36:47.099]  Huge article.
[01:36:47.779 --> 01:36:54.505]  From Steve Watson at PrisonPlanet.com, Obama may call for gun control during State of the Union.
[01:36:54.505 --> 01:37:01.912]  We also have the Examiner and the New York Daily News reporting that they're holding these 100 mafia people at a military base.
[01:37:01.912 --> 01:37:06.697]  This is the slow rollout of this homeland security grid.
[01:37:06.697 --> 01:37:10.060]  So I wanted to get Dr. Corsi first to talk about
[01:37:11.421 --> 01:37:34.971]  The governor's council that he's really been researching I've even had jagged former, you know colonels on who were saying it's very dangerous and where all this is going and what he thinks of Cass Sunstein calling for arresting global warming skeptics what he thinks of Cohen behind the scenes now admitting that he Pressured Time Warner to shut down Ventura's episode on the police state which from the research.
[01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:35.871]  It's all documented I
[01:37:37.372 --> 01:37:44.597]  I mean, these are really dark times when Pennsylvania Avenue is lined with the bloodiest flag in history of the murderous Communist Chinese.
[01:37:44.597 --> 01:37:51.221]  Our media is telling us how the Singapore slash Communist Chinese model is the model for the world.
[01:37:51.221 --> 01:37:53.242]  We're told China's now our owner.
[01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:54.984]  I mean, this stuff is accelerating.
[01:37:54.984 --> 01:37:56.244]  Is it not, Dr. Corsi?
[01:37:56.244 --> 01:38:01.288]  Well, I think all the concerns are legitimate, Alex, and I share your concerns.
[01:38:01.288 --> 01:38:06.091]  Representative Cohen today issued a statement, a non-apology apology.
[01:38:06.877 --> 01:38:14.938]  You know, like, I'm not sorry for what I said, but I'm sorry if it may have offended some people, the kind of way Cohen approached it.
[01:38:14.938 --> 01:38:17.399]  And I thought that was really disingenuous.
[01:38:17.399 --> 01:38:28.761]  I mean, here, right after all the left is out saying we've got to tone down the vitriol, Cohen is on the floor of the House accusing Republicans of being Nazis.
[01:38:28.761 --> 01:38:35.522]  And that's just unacceptable for the Democrats to have this double standard that applies to anybody except those on the left.
[01:38:36.513 --> 01:38:37.794]  Well, it's not just a double standard.
[01:38:37.794 --> 01:38:40.556]  We've seen Obama say they bring a knife, we bring a gun.
[01:38:40.556 --> 01:38:45.019]  We've seen congressmen saying he wants to line up Republican governors and shoot them.
[01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:47.220]  I mean, I'm non-partisan, as you know.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.201]  I'm just a libertarian that wants freedom.
[01:38:49.201 --> 01:39:01.690]  But, I mean, all the union thugs beating people up, I'd say Democratic vitriol and Democrat thugs attacking people in the streets, it's got to be 10 to 1 what we see conservatives doing.
[01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:05.292]  Well, and the left has been known for this for, I mean, forever.
[01:39:05.891 --> 01:39:19.614]  The tactic is, basically, if you can't defeat your opponent by argument, engage in ridicule, brutality, anything to marginalize or beat up or intimidate your opponent.
[01:39:19.614 --> 01:39:20.535]  That's one of the themes.
[01:39:20.535 --> 01:39:25.016]  It's all Linskey's rules for radicals.
[01:39:25.016 --> 01:39:31.877]  Ridicule your opponents, engage in ad hominem attacks, marginalize them, personalize the attacks.
[01:39:31.877 --> 01:39:34.058]  These tactics on the left are unacceptable.
[01:39:34.674 --> 01:39:40.299]  Especially for anybody, libertarian, conservative, whomever, trying to pursue the truth.
[01:39:40.299 --> 01:39:41.680]  I'm an investigative reporter.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:48.727]  You know, Alex, I've reported and criticized both Republican and Democratic presidents alike.
[01:39:48.727 --> 01:39:59.777]  I was excruciated, got excoriated by the George Bush supporters when I was writing the late great USA and reporting on the North American Union and the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.
[01:40:00.478 --> 01:40:04.499]  So it's really not fair to characterize me as a Republican.
[01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:06.760]  I'm not a member of the Republican Party.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.361]  The only party I ever joined was the Constitution Party.
[01:40:11.361 --> 01:40:18.724]  Finishing up with the 10 FEMA regions, the Governor's Council, I know you've written some very piercing articles that concur with my analysis.
[01:40:18.724 --> 01:40:28.607]  To have Cohen running around when confronted by Ventura and saying that the Emergency Centers Act did not exist until he was handed the bill, and then he goes, oh, I do remember that now.
[01:40:28.607 --> 01:40:30.027]  I mean, it's a Perry Mason moment.
[01:40:30.487 --> 01:40:40.010]  Sylvester caught with a Tweety Bird in his mouth, and then he goes on to basically say there's no Governor's Council, none of this is real, none of this is a threat.
[01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:42.071]  Is he counting on people's ignorance?
[01:40:42.071 --> 01:40:44.992]  Well, I think he is.
[01:40:44.992 --> 01:40:48.033]  First of all, Jesse Ventura has done very good reporting.
[01:40:48.033 --> 01:40:52.595]  I think this new series Ventura has on television is excellent.
[01:40:52.595 --> 01:40:57.056]  I especially like to show the JFK murder conspiracy.
[01:40:57.056 --> 01:40:58.597]  I thought that was particularly well done.
[01:40:58.868 --> 01:41:03.411]  Well, he broke with insiders right before ClimateGate even came out.
[01:41:03.411 --> 01:41:06.414]  He had the basic ClimateGate info and exposed global warming.
[01:41:06.414 --> 01:41:15.781]  And you know, Jesse went into that, he's got a mix of views, believing it, and I and others convinced him and showed him the documents, and so he told the truth.
[01:41:15.781 --> 01:41:18.323]  I mean, he's real, and that's what they don't like.
[01:41:18.323 --> 01:41:18.863]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:18.863 --> 01:41:22.986]  And I've written on the FEMA contracts.
[01:41:22.986 --> 01:41:24.407]  They have contracts.
[01:41:24.407 --> 01:41:26.729]  I don't have them in front of me right now, the articles I've written.
[01:41:27.179 --> 01:41:30.400]  No, I know I sprung this on you, but let's talk about FEMA.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.862]  There's contracts out there for the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:41:34.862 --> 01:41:41.285]  Legitimate contracts with major contractors to build detention camps whenever they need them, for whatever reason.
[01:41:41.285 --> 01:41:51.930]  And I've got to start getting into it again, but the directives on the National Security Directive that President Bush signed, that basically gives the President dictatorial power.
[01:41:53.416 --> 01:41:59.058]  Take over even all governments down to tribal governments on the presidential declaration.
[01:41:59.058 --> 01:42:03.959]  There's a national emergency without the involvement of Congress in that declaration.
[01:42:03.959 --> 01:42:18.523]  President Obama has actually now started expanding these powers with executive orders again that buttress the office of the presidency in a self-declared emergency, national emergency by the president, to become a virtual dictator.
[01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:26.097]  Those are very frightening powers that I think, again, need to be constantly examined and I need to get back to reporting on them as well.
[01:42:26.926 --> 01:42:35.249]  Well, it's going into high gear and for Cohen to run around calling people Nazis all at the same time a few weeks ago, calling to cut down the vitriol.
[01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:37.009]  We need the Fairness Doctrine.
[01:42:37.009 --> 01:42:39.850]  We need to have the government regulate the Internet.
[01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:41.411]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[01:42:41.411 --> 01:42:45.772]  How many czars have we had praise Mao or praise Chavez?
[01:42:45.772 --> 01:42:51.034]  We have the FCC diversity czar openly saying we need Chavez type media controls.
[01:42:51.034 --> 01:42:53.055]  I mean, this is these people are not liberals.
[01:42:53.055 --> 01:42:54.095]  They're authoritarians.
[01:42:54.215 --> 01:43:04.719]  Well, John Holdren saying that for population control, you know, for climate control, we may need to have population control, we may need to consider forced sterilization.
[01:43:04.719 --> 01:43:06.900]  Look, what's going on, Alex, is very clear.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:14.723]  The far left wants to control, they want to create a narrative, and the narrative they want to create is anybody who disagrees with them.
[01:43:15.632 --> 01:43:17.174]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:43:36.517 --> 01:43:40.800]  Or, you know, the investigations that I do, I'm excoriated all the time by the left.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:49.706]  Because we disagree, because we don't go along with the party line the left wants propagated, we're immediately demonized.
[01:43:49.706 --> 01:43:59.532]  Briefly, and then I want to get into the big news here, the birth certificate, where there's smoke there's fire, and this is... I was open-minded about this two years ago, and thought maybe it was baloney now.
[01:43:59.532 --> 01:44:02.214]  The evidence is clear, they're hiding something big.
[01:44:02.214 --> 01:44:03.035]  But just briefly,
[01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:21.408]  Your take on the situation with China, what the media's doing, where they're saying, we can learn from China, China's good, we're bad, they're our new boss, what the system's trying to push there, and the latest tidbits on the SPP, North American Union, integration by stealth.
[01:44:21.408 --> 01:44:24.069]  Well, people have got to read My America for Sale.
[01:44:24.069 --> 01:44:33.213]  I've been warning for years that we're headed into a globalist configuration, a globalist attendant, and it's again globalist of the left and the right.
[01:44:33.922 --> 01:44:43.929]  The multinational corporations and Henry Kissinger and Council on Foreign Relations, and the left, the open borders crowd, it's Zygmunt Brzezinski, it's Barack Obama.
[01:44:43.929 --> 01:44:45.931]  They want to erase borders.
[01:44:45.931 --> 01:44:50.414]  China is fine with these people because China exploits labor.
[01:44:50.414 --> 01:44:52.175]  China's a dictatorial government.
[01:44:52.728 --> 01:44:56.730]  That a communist does not tolerate free speech.
[01:44:56.730 --> 01:45:01.273]  I'll try bringing a Bible into China and see how far you get.
[01:45:01.273 --> 01:45:03.535]  Don't have too many children in China.
[01:45:03.535 --> 01:45:07.137]  Don't disagree with the government or you'll be sent to thought reform.
[01:45:07.137 --> 01:45:17.563]  And that China has a veneer of some business principles does not mean that China has become a capitalist country, or one that is not dangerous to our national interests.
[01:45:17.563 --> 01:45:20.085]  And now we're deeply indebted to China.
[01:45:20.851 --> 01:45:25.032]  And Barack Obama is in a position of having to bow, can't object to anything.
[01:45:25.032 --> 01:45:26.773]  I thought it was disgraceful.
[01:45:26.773 --> 01:45:30.734]  It was clearly something I never expected to see in my lifetime.
[01:45:30.734 --> 01:45:35.695]  Why does he continue to Saudi, British Royals, Communists, Dictators?
[01:45:35.695 --> 01:45:41.156]  I mean, he literally bows like an errand boy, and they don't bow to him.
[01:45:41.156 --> 01:45:43.677]  And they even look at him like he's pathetic.
[01:45:43.677 --> 01:45:45.798]  Is this part of the humiliation of America?
[01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:47.098]  Part of a larger PSYOP?
[01:45:47.658 --> 01:45:52.342]  I think it's part of the whole theme, yes, that America is at fault.
[01:45:52.342 --> 01:46:14.140]  That we're, you know, look, when I wrote the Abomination, I point out Barack Obama comes from a far leftist basis intellectually, mentors like Frank Marshall Davis, who was truly communist, and the narrative there is that the United States is a capitalist, imperialist, oppressor country that enslaved the blacks.
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:15.141]  Barack Obama also
[01:46:15.874 --> 01:46:19.977]  Disrespects the British because of British colonialism.
[01:46:19.977 --> 01:46:22.339]  Saying that the French are our greatest friend ever.
[01:46:22.339 --> 01:46:27.303]  Well, I mean, I can remember lots of times the French weren't particularly friendly to us at all.
[01:46:27.303 --> 01:46:34.649]  And here you've got a situation where America being blamed is the narrative out of the White House.
[01:46:34.649 --> 01:46:38.452]  The apology tour that Barack Obama ran and continues to run.
[01:46:39.278 --> 01:46:39.679]  Yes, we are.
[01:46:49.841 --> 01:46:55.042]  But you don't dare talk about Hu Jintao being elected by a committee of dictators.
[01:46:55.042 --> 01:46:56.562]  You don't dare talk about that.
[01:46:56.562 --> 01:47:03.363]  Oh, how dare Harry Reid actually, you know, a blind pig can find acorns, broken clocks are right twice a day.
[01:47:03.363 --> 01:47:05.404]  I mean, oh, how dare him?
[01:47:05.404 --> 01:47:09.864]  How dare someone in the press corps ask a mild question about human rights?
[01:47:09.864 --> 01:47:11.185]  This is terrible.
[01:47:11.185 --> 01:47:15.205]  I mean, it's a total capitulation to tyranny and authoritarianism.
[01:47:15.205 --> 01:47:16.225]  And I know you read a lot.
[01:47:16.225 --> 01:47:17.586]  I see it all over the media.
[01:47:17.586 --> 01:47:18.906]  Cheerleading on the left and right.
[01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:26.807]  For authoritarianism, reminiscent of the 30s, when anything authoritative was, like, sexy.
[01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:31.948]  Well, people, you know, don't know, because we don't teach history in the American schools anymore.
[01:47:31.948 --> 01:47:40.070]  But when, in the 30s, when fascism and Nazism were starting in Italy and in Europe, the U.S.
[01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:42.430]  was enthusiastic about both.
[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:45.451]  Hitler was on the cover of Time Magazine as Man of the Year.
[01:47:46.733 --> 01:47:51.076]  This is the kind of thing that you had that people don't remember.
[01:47:51.076 --> 01:47:53.018]  I've documented it, others have documented it.
[01:47:53.018 --> 01:48:00.903]  You've got, you know, the Wall Street crowd, including Prescott Bush, helping to fund the Nazis.
[01:48:00.903 --> 01:48:11.011]  The Dulles family, Averill Harriman, this whole group running Union Bank, which Franklin Roosevelt closed down because it was a Nazi bank being run in the United States.
[01:48:11.542 --> 01:48:15.486]  We want to erase all this part of our history, and we're doing it again.
[01:48:15.486 --> 01:48:20.170]  We're having both the left and the right falling in love with China.
[01:48:20.170 --> 01:48:26.837]  What I've warned again and again and again, America repels the key theme that China exploits labor.
[01:48:26.837 --> 01:48:29.299]  Their whole proposition is that they have slave labor.
[01:48:29.299 --> 01:48:31.301]  They're going to continue slave labor.
[01:48:31.301 --> 01:48:32.182]  It's immoral.
[01:48:32.182 --> 01:48:33.683]  It's bad business.
[01:48:33.683 --> 01:48:36.666]  And China's moving to the point where they're going to demand assets.
[01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:38.470]  And they're now doing that.
[01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.031]  Now shifting gears, we're almost out of time.
[01:48:40.031 --> 01:48:44.992]  Let's get into the big news here with Jerome Corsi who writes for WorldNetDaily.
[01:48:44.992 --> 01:48:47.533]  Also writes with Red Alert there at WorldNetDaily.
[01:48:47.533 --> 01:48:49.534]  We're linked to it all at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:49.534 --> 01:48:56.796]  Let's, because we're about to go to break, I want to start talking about Hawaiian governor can't find Obama's birth certificate.
[01:48:56.796 --> 01:49:00.257]  Suggests controversy could hurt president's re-election chances.
[01:49:00.257 --> 01:49:01.937]  The Mail looked into it and they concur.
[01:49:01.937 --> 01:49:04.218]  Hawaiian governor claims record of Obama's birth
[01:49:04.878 --> 01:49:08.080]  Exist in archives but can't produce the vital document.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:13.423]  I mean, for years they said, oh, that is his birth certificate, that fake receipt.
[01:49:13.423 --> 01:49:15.764]  Now, Chris Matthews a month ago said, yeah, just show it.
[01:49:15.764 --> 01:49:17.765]  Where's the original with the signature?
[01:49:17.765 --> 01:49:20.606]  I mean, this is really starting to look suspicious.
[01:49:20.606 --> 01:49:22.267]  Dr. Corsi, start getting into it.
[01:49:22.267 --> 01:49:33.233]  Well, the key document that should be produced, if it exists, and I don't believe it does, is the long-form, hospital-generated Hawaiian birth certificate for Barack Obama.
[01:49:33.965 --> 01:49:38.206]  Now, he was born at Campigliani Hospital, like he claims, in Hawaii in 1961.
[01:49:38.206 --> 01:49:41.227]  Fine, I'm happy to believe that.
[01:49:41.227 --> 01:49:43.227]  Why can't I see the document?
[01:49:43.227 --> 01:49:47.188]  Why can't we see this long-form hospital-generated birth certificate?
[01:49:47.188 --> 01:49:59.191]  And the problem is, Governor Abercrombie comes on in and promises he's going to investigate this, and a friend of Barack Obama, a 60s, hippie, liberal, anti-war guy, Barack Obama's friend,
[01:49:59.995 --> 01:50:06.640]  Abercrombie only can find a log registry notice that Barack Obama was born.
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:20.250]  And the problem, Alex, is you could today, and in 1961, the grandparents could go in to the Hawaii Department of Health and say, I want to register this baby as Hawaiian-born, and Hawaii would do it.
[01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:27.115]  They'd put out the newspaper announcements, they would register it in a logbook, even if the baby was born in a foreign country.
[01:50:27.771 --> 01:50:30.394]  Hawaii has been doing this for years.
[01:50:30.394 --> 01:50:37.602]  Hawaii gave Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese nationalist in the 20s, they gave him a birth certificate.
[01:50:37.602 --> 01:50:41.706]  Because affidavits were produced saying Sun Yat-sen was born in Hawaii.
[01:50:41.706 --> 01:50:43.348]  It was all nonsense.
[01:50:43.348 --> 01:50:45.330]  Hawaii's been like this forever.
[01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:47.712]  Not of course he stayed there, because that's the key.
[01:50:48.777 --> 01:50:52.705]  One thing they say is, why would parents and grandparents forge that he's a citizen?
[01:50:52.705 --> 01:50:54.248]  That's incredibly valuable!
[01:50:54.248 --> 01:50:57.113]  If he's born out of the country, of course they're going to try to forge that!
[01:50:57.113 --> 01:50:57.935]  So he can be a U.S.
[01:50:57.935 --> 01:50:58.677]  citizen!
[01:50:58.677 --> 01:51:00.119]  Makes people do this all the time!
[01:51:00.119 --> 01:51:00.620]  We'll be right back!
[01:51:01.857 --> 01:51:08.662]  One of the most potent ways to lower blood pressure is to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme in the body, also called ACE.
[01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:13.245]  In nature, there are a group of proteins found in unheated whey that inhibit the ACE enzyme.
[01:51:13.245 --> 01:51:16.447]  The most potent ACE inhibitor to date is Lactokinin.
[01:51:16.447 --> 01:51:26.875]  While Lactokinin does not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, this naturally occurring whey peptide may be able to help keep blood pressure normal.
[01:51:27.375 --> 01:51:31.537]  The most powerful whey protein supplement on the market is One World Whey.
[01:51:31.537 --> 01:51:36.999]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[01:51:36.999 --> 01:51:40.501]  One World Whey is easily digested and tastes delicious.
[01:51:40.501 --> 01:51:47.284]  Use One World Whey to support your exercise or weight loss goals, your optimal blood pressure, energy, endurance, and mood.
[01:51:47.284 --> 01:51:48.464]  To order, call 888-988-3325.
[01:51:48.464 --> 01:51:48.684]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:52:00.911 --> 01:52:02.212]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.212 --> 01:52:07.797]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.797 --> 01:52:12.821]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.821 --> 01:52:13.301]  It's true.
[01:52:13.301 --> 01:52:16.103]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:16.103 --> 01:52:17.865]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.385 --> 01:52:23.606]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.606 --> 01:52:25.927]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.927 --> 01:52:30.728]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.728 --> 01:52:31.848]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.848 --> 01:52:34.909]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.909 --> 01:52:38.190]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:41.712]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.712 --> 01:52:43.933]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:43.933 --> 01:52:45.734]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.734 --> 01:52:51.477]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.477 --> 01:52:57.581]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.581 --> 01:53:00.522]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:00.522 --> 01:53:02.283]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:53:02.283 --> 01:53:03.384]  How would that make you feel?
[01:53:03.624 --> 01:53:05.325]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:53:05.325 --> 01:53:07.887]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:07.887 --> 01:53:15.451]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:15.451 --> 01:53:16.932]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:16.932 --> 01:53:19.694]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:53:19.694 --> 01:53:24.997]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:24.997 --> 01:53:30.040]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:35.322]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:35.322 --> 01:53:39.743]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:39.743 --> 01:53:44.445]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:44.445 --> 01:53:47.826]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:47.826 --> 01:53:52.528]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:52.528 --> 01:53:56.369]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:54:16.118 --> 01:54:19.340]  Now we're going to spend more time on the birth certificate, but he's going to be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:23.223]  I want to get into this whole Mexican truck situation.
[01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:28.887]  They don't have to follow the standards we do, just like Obama gives waivers to his favorite companies on health care.
[01:54:28.887 --> 01:54:29.988]  This is discrimination.
[01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:35.311]  This is the big city Chicago mafia model where you got to be on the inside or you don't get jobs.
[01:54:35.311 --> 01:54:37.793]  So how bad is this starting to hurt Obama?
[01:54:37.793 --> 01:54:43.577]  I know he's gotten a disgusting 15 point bounce out of the tragedy in Arizona.
[01:54:44.798 --> 01:54:48.161]  But please continue with the latest on the birth certificate.
[01:54:48.161 --> 01:54:52.865]  Well, the balance of the public relations of Obama, I think, is public relations fluff.
[01:54:52.865 --> 01:54:54.946]  I don't expect it's going to last.
[01:54:54.946 --> 01:55:01.091]  The economic problems remain, and they're going to be the ultimate, I think, difficulty for Obama.
[01:55:01.091 --> 01:55:04.014]  The birth certificate is not going away is the question.
[01:55:04.014 --> 01:55:12.581]  Right now, you've got Governor Abercrombie, a friend of Obama, comes into office, says, I'm going to produce the documentary evidence Obama was born in Hawaii.
[01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:19.675]  Cannot find, does not produce, a long-form hospital-generated birth certificate.
[01:55:19.675 --> 01:55:31.519]  Says to the Hawaii, the Honolulu Daily Star Advertiser that all he can find is this notation written down in an archive that Barack Obama was born.
[01:55:31.519 --> 01:55:39.342]  And the problem is, I think the grandparents came in and registered this birth, which you could do in Hawaii, even if the baby was born somewhere else.
[01:55:40.394 --> 01:55:47.778]  Because the advertisement in the newspapers at the time of the birth announcement were the grandparent's address.
[01:55:47.778 --> 01:55:50.319]  The husband and wife never lived at that address.
[01:55:50.319 --> 01:55:58.242]  In fact, three weeks after the baby was born, Ann Dunham and Barack Obama's junior little baby were in Seattle.
[01:55:58.242 --> 01:56:03.845]  She was attending the University of Washington in extension courses.
[01:56:04.605 --> 01:56:05.025]  I don't know.
[01:56:19.887 --> 01:56:22.410]  Wanting to make sure that Barack Obama got to be a U.S.
[01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:25.313]  citizen, not because he was going to run for president.
[01:56:25.313 --> 01:56:26.994]  That's a silly idea.
[01:56:26.994 --> 01:56:29.937]  But because there's intrinsic advantages to being a U.S.
[01:56:29.937 --> 01:56:30.938]  citizen.
[01:56:30.938 --> 01:56:33.761]  Like you get to go to college as a U.S.
[01:56:33.761 --> 01:56:34.742]  citizen and U.S.
[01:56:34.742 --> 01:56:36.404]  schools on a preferential basis.
[01:56:37.907 --> 01:56:42.451]  You get a passport, and you get Social Security, you get all kinds of benefits as a U.S.
[01:56:42.451 --> 01:56:43.212]  citizen.
[01:56:43.212 --> 01:56:46.775]  Like in the ancient Roman world, everybody wanted to be a Roman citizen.
[01:56:46.775 --> 01:56:50.479]  One day in 1961, everybody wanted to be a U.S.
[01:56:50.479 --> 01:56:55.703]  citizen, and Barack Obama's grandparents, I believe, registered his birth in Hawaii.
[01:56:55.703 --> 01:57:01.629]  Even though there's no documentary evidence, like a long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate, let's see it.
[01:57:02.729 --> 01:57:05.211]  This demonstrates that Barack Obama was born in a white house.
[01:57:05.211 --> 01:57:06.412]  What do you make of Matthews?
[01:57:06.412 --> 01:57:10.696]  Well, obviously the mother, too, is going to call him and say, hey, I want my boy to be an American.
[01:57:10.696 --> 01:57:12.398]  I want to be able to even get him in the country.
[01:57:12.398 --> 01:57:14.159]  I mean, of course.
[01:57:14.159 --> 01:57:14.519]  Of course.
[01:57:14.519 --> 01:57:17.862]  But what does it mean now that Matthews is going, just release it.
[01:57:17.862 --> 01:57:22.186]  I mean, they've gone from stonewalling and claiming they've released a birth certificate to saying release it.
[01:57:22.186 --> 01:57:27.190]  And this governor stuck his foot in his mouth before he was actually in office when he was governor-elect.
[01:57:27.190 --> 01:57:28.852]  And now he's saying, oops, I can't find it.
[01:57:29.673 --> 01:57:36.916]  Well, Abu Dhabi, I think, was right in saying that this is going to become a major re-election problem for President Obama.
[01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.417]  And it turns out that he's lied.
[01:57:38.417 --> 01:57:39.577]  Obama has lied.
[01:57:39.577 --> 01:57:46.560]  Like I pointed out in Abomination, there's repeated lies in Obama's nativity story and the story of his life.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.781]  We don't have his passport record.
[01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:50.762]  We don't have his travel record.
[01:57:50.762 --> 01:57:56.304]  The records I've got in Indonesia, he was registered at school as a Muslim and an Indonesian citizen.
[01:57:56.917 --> 01:58:03.779]  The mother, when they were in Indonesia, changed her passport, dropped Barack Obama, suggested he was an Indonesian citizen.
[01:58:04.178 --> 01:58:05.920]  But they've now talked to the school.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:10.524]  All the stuff you put out two, three years ago, it's all been all over mainstream foreign news now.
[01:58:10.524 --> 01:58:11.325]  Right, exactly.
[01:58:11.325 --> 01:58:13.807]  And Barack Obama's undocumented.
[01:58:13.807 --> 01:58:19.993]  We don't have his medical records, we don't have his school records, we don't have his law office records.
[01:58:19.993 --> 01:58:22.175]  We don't have anything on Barack Obama.
[01:58:22.175 --> 01:58:29.122]  And if we can't get the passport record and the long-form Hawaii hospital-generated birth certificate,
[01:58:30.142 --> 01:58:31.263]  I was there in Hawaii.
[01:58:31.263 --> 01:58:34.724]  The hospitals don't have record of Barack Obama being born there.
[01:58:34.724 --> 01:58:36.565]  I hired private investigators.
[01:58:36.565 --> 01:58:37.506]  The records aren't there.
[01:58:37.506 --> 01:58:38.266]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:38.266 --> 01:58:39.687]  Tell us about that and then the truck.
[01:58:39.687 --> 01:58:41.408]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.408 --> 01:58:47.411]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:47.411 --> 01:58:50.212]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:52.668 --> 01:58:56.692]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.692 --> 01:58:59.935]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.935 --> 01:59:04.739]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.739 --> 01:59:11.125]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:11.125 --> 01:59:13.368]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.908 --> 01:59:14.208]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:14.208 --> 01:59:14.729]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.729 --> 01:59:15.389]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:15.389 --> 01:59:16.671]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:16.671 --> 01:59:18.913]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.805 --> 01:59:34.926]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.926 --> 01:59:40.068]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:40.068 --> 01:59:54.315]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:54.315 --> 01:59:56.696]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.696 --> 01:59:59.457]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:06.101 --> 02:00:10.983]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm getting into the economy.
[02:00:27.227 --> 02:00:30.350]  Well Alex, first of all, I think the birth certificate issue is only going to increase
[02:00:56.408 --> 02:01:00.170]  Presidents who stonewall do not end up very well.
[02:01:00.170 --> 02:01:03.912]  A clear example of that is Richard Nixon.
[02:01:03.912 --> 02:01:18.199]  And I think at least one state, maybe more, is going to pass a law that for the 2012 presidential election, the candidates are going to have to show to the Secretary of State in that state birth credential to qualify under the Constitution.
[02:01:18.199 --> 02:01:23.922]  Otherwise, the candidate is not going to get on the ballot in that state as the presidential candidate.
[02:01:23.922 --> 02:01:25.463]  One major state, Texas,
[02:01:26.306 --> 02:01:32.649]  Passing that kind of a law, Barack Obama might just have to drop out of the re-election campaign.
[02:01:32.649 --> 02:01:37.891]  Well, there's already, we've seen the Washington Post a few months ago and others telling him to drop out already.
[02:01:37.891 --> 02:01:46.054]  Well, in fact, I think the intensity of demonizing anybody like me who's saying, where's the birth certificate, shows that the left is
[02:01:46.696 --> 02:01:49.157]  Really afraid of this issue.
[02:01:49.157 --> 02:01:56.901]  And if the issue could be answered, if Barack Obama had been born in a Hawaii hospital like he says he has, I think we'd have already seen all the documentation.
[02:01:56.901 --> 02:01:59.602]  I hired private investigators in 2008.
[02:01:59.602 --> 02:02:02.403]  When I wrote The Abomination, I went to Hawaii.
[02:02:02.403 --> 02:02:06.905]  I can tell you there are no records of the Hawaii hospital that Barack Obama was born there.
[02:02:08.965 --> 02:02:09.586]  Incredible.
[02:02:09.586 --> 02:02:11.989]  I mean, you know this was brought up during the campaign.
[02:02:11.989 --> 02:02:12.669]  Right.
[02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:15.493]  And the Barack Obama people only ever lied.
[02:02:15.493 --> 02:02:18.376]  They said two different hospitals was where he was born.
[02:02:18.376 --> 02:02:20.639]  The first version was Queens Medical Center.
[02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:23.001]  Now it's Kapi'olani Medical Center.
[02:02:23.001 --> 02:02:26.646]  And neither hospital has any record that Barack Obama was born there.
[02:02:27.298 --> 02:02:30.359]  Well, they would have an admission record, at least.
[02:02:30.359 --> 02:02:36.040]  The mother would have been there, there would have been a record of a birth, and there would have been a hospital-generated long-form birth certificate.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.881]  Did the establishment know this and put him in there for the blackmail angle?
[02:02:40.881 --> 02:02:51.763]  Possibly, but I think the enthusiasm here over Barack Obama, far left, mainstream media got behind it, you know, all the issues of this leftist president.
[02:02:52.535 --> 02:02:55.476]  Alright, we're almost out of time and you've got to go, don't you?
[02:03:14.126 --> 02:03:16.668]  Yes, I've got another show coming right up, but I'll come back.
[02:03:16.668 --> 02:03:21.092]  Yeah, because we've got about two minutes left and I was going to get into the economy, but let's get into the Mexican trucks.
[02:03:21.092 --> 02:03:23.354]  We've got a minute and a half on that.
[02:03:23.354 --> 02:03:25.595]  Well, Barack Obama is going to have a plan.
[02:03:25.595 --> 02:03:28.758]  I've got copies of the concept document.
[02:03:28.758 --> 02:03:31.040]  I've been talking to the Department of Transportation.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:37.445]  Mexican trucks are going to be rolling in the United States, all through the United States, a new pilot program by mid-year.
[02:03:38.291 --> 02:03:43.052]  And remember, in 2009, Barack Obama signed the omnibus funding bill.
[02:03:43.052 --> 02:03:50.955]  Congress had taken away the money from the Bush administration, Mexican truck pilot, because, of course, the trucks don't meet U.S.
[02:03:50.955 --> 02:03:52.835]  standards, the drivers don't meet U.S.
[02:03:52.835 --> 02:03:56.336]  standards, there's safety issues, the trucks are not going to be inspected.
[02:03:56.336 --> 02:03:57.737]  They don't let our trucks down there!
[02:03:58.579 --> 02:04:03.541]  And, you know, our trucks, first of all, most American truckers wouldn't want to go to Mexico.
[02:04:03.541 --> 02:04:09.022]  They probably wouldn't end up with their rigs stolen by the side of the road dead.
[02:04:09.022 --> 02:04:15.184]  The point is, Obama is just as much of a globalist, if not more, than George Bush.
[02:04:15.865 --> 02:04:19.753]  Obama campaigned on that he was going to renegotiate NAFTA and save U.S.
[02:04:19.753 --> 02:04:20.574]  jobs.
[02:04:20.574 --> 02:04:21.636]  He's doing the opposite.
[02:04:21.636 --> 02:04:23.199]  He's going to open the border.
[02:04:23.199 --> 02:04:25.183]  We're going to have Mexican trucks back in the United States.
[02:04:25.183 --> 02:04:28.048]  So we've got to put pressure on Congress to block that key part of the SPP.
[02:04:29.025 --> 02:04:33.228]  Well, and again, we've now got the Trusted Traveler program in place.
[02:04:33.228 --> 02:04:37.911]  On November 30th, Janet Napolitano signed the program with Mexican Mexicans.
[02:04:37.911 --> 02:04:43.174]  Now, 80-some million of them estimated can become Trusted Travelers in North America.
[02:04:43.174 --> 02:04:50.299]  They get a card with a map of the continental, the North America on it, no borders.
[02:04:50.299 --> 02:04:54.101]  They swipe it through a global entry terminal and they come into the United States.
[02:04:54.101 --> 02:04:55.302]  Go to globalentry.gov.
[02:04:55.762 --> 02:04:57.166]  Yeah, that's the SPP right there.
[02:04:57.166 --> 02:04:58.410]  We're all being integrated right now.
[02:04:58.410 --> 02:04:59.674]  Dr. Corsi, thank you so much.
[02:04:59.674 --> 02:05:00.476]  Appreciate you joining us.
[02:05:03.288 --> 02:05:07.249]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:07.249 --> 02:05:16.110]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:20.731]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.731 --> 02:05:31.553]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:32.193 --> 02:05:41.715]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.715 --> 02:05:47.137]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:47.137 --> 02:05:54.618]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.618 --> 02:05:57.379]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:01.292 --> 02:06:02.453]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:02.453 --> 02:06:09.397]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:09.397 --> 02:06:11.939]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.939 --> 02:06:17.322]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:17.322 --> 02:06:20.364]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:20.364 --> 02:06:22.425]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.685 --> 02:06:28.930]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.930 --> 02:06:32.312]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:32.312 --> 02:06:38.096]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:38.096 --> 02:06:39.737]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.737 --> 02:06:41.038]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:41.038 --> 02:06:43.540]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:47.926]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.926 --> 02:06:52.552]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:52.552 --> 02:06:55.136]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:06:55.136 --> 02:06:59.001]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:59.001 --> 02:07:00.023]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:01.323 --> 02:07:04.906]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:07:04.906 --> 02:07:06.207]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:07:06.207 --> 02:07:10.610]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:07:10.610 --> 02:07:16.554]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:07:16.554 --> 02:07:18.696]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:07:18.696 --> 02:07:21.378]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:07:21.718 --> 02:07:28.222]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:07:28.222 --> 02:07:30.424]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:07:30.424 --> 02:07:35.767]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:07:35.767 --> 02:07:41.051]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:07:41.051 --> 02:07:46.234]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:07:46.414 --> 02:07:49.616]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[02:07:49.616 --> 02:07:52.618]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:52.618 --> 02:07:53.378]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.443 --> 02:08:04.684]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.684 --> 02:08:08.145]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.145 --> 02:08:14.927]  All right, we're going to open the phones up with your take on the Chinese flags flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.
[02:08:14.927 --> 02:08:20.789]  The media is just everywhere saying, China's wonderful, they're good, America's bad.
[02:08:20.789 --> 02:08:23.950]  Globalism is good, Henry Kissinger.
[02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:28.752]  I saw the clip earlier, it was just on Charlie Rose last night about, this crisis has been perfect.
[02:08:29.778 --> 02:08:33.761]  What we're doing now is the world is accepting the new world order.
[02:08:33.761 --> 02:08:42.927]  I've got a ton, a ton of news I want to cover, including Obama may call for gun control during State of the Union.
[02:08:42.927 --> 02:08:44.588]  This is huge.
[02:08:44.588 --> 02:08:49.712]  Steve Watson report with all the attributed links there to AFP, NBC.
[02:08:49.712 --> 02:08:52.334]  Obama may call for gun control during State of the Union.
[02:08:52.334 --> 02:08:53.635]  I had a plan today
[02:08:54.535 --> 02:08:57.256]  And it's always successful if I do it in the first or second hour.
[02:08:57.256 --> 02:09:00.038]  If I do it in the third hour, it's generally successful.
[02:09:00.038 --> 02:09:03.159]  I don't do it as much as I used to because it's such a powerful tool.
[02:09:03.159 --> 02:09:05.180]  I want to use it sparingly.
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:11.764]  But by doing Google Bombs, by making search terms number one, it makes a lot of other news pay attention to it.
[02:09:11.764 --> 02:09:13.805]  It makes a lot of people link to us.
[02:09:13.805 --> 02:09:15.746]  It makes a lot of people go read our stories.
[02:09:15.746 --> 02:09:17.787]  So they get the full spectrum of what's happening.
[02:09:18.487 --> 02:09:25.212]  It's not just that China is a threat to our liberties and freedoms and driving down our wages, it's that it teamed up with the globalists.
[02:09:25.212 --> 02:09:28.254]  So I want to do a Google search.
[02:09:28.254 --> 02:09:31.616]  We did this a week ago and we made the number one, number two, and number three search.
[02:09:31.616 --> 02:09:33.497]  All three of the searches we launched.
[02:09:33.497 --> 02:09:35.559]  You did an incredible job together.
[02:09:35.559 --> 02:09:38.701]  So before I get into some of this news and open the phones up,
[02:09:39.577 --> 02:09:40.818]  The total free number, by the way, is 800-259-9231.
[02:09:40.818 --> 02:09:46.984]  They're announcing, oh, housing's worse than we thought.
[02:09:46.984 --> 02:09:48.705]  Oh, interest rates are going up.
[02:09:48.705 --> 02:09:50.347]  Oh, this was all planned.
[02:09:50.347 --> 02:09:51.808]  They've been lying to everybody.
[02:09:51.808 --> 02:09:53.209]  They knew this was going to happen.
[02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:54.631]  They've done this over and over again.
[02:09:54.631 --> 02:09:55.551]  I want to get your take on it.
[02:09:55.551 --> 02:09:55.892]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:55.892 --> 02:09:57.293]  We'll get into Obama and the gun control.
[02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:08.504]  There's another article here at PrisonPlanet.com, Congressman, Senator, or President Ron Paul in 2012.
[02:10:10.974 --> 02:10:20.678]  And Ron Paul says he's seriously considering a 2012 Senate run after he was voted Texas' most popular choice to replace outgoing Senator in a recent survey.
[02:10:20.678 --> 02:10:26.141]  He'll be joining us Friday from Texas, from down there in Lake Jackson.
[02:10:26.141 --> 02:10:30.042]  So we look forward to that in the first hour on Friday, I guess that's tomorrow.
[02:10:30.042 --> 02:10:34.804]  And more and more he's creeping towards it, but I think the presidential run's the way to go.
[02:10:34.804 --> 02:10:35.945]  The Senate's a shoe-in.
[02:10:37.398 --> 02:10:38.919]  He'll win.
[02:10:38.919 --> 02:10:41.621]  In Texas it's 84% approval rating.
[02:10:41.621 --> 02:10:42.661]  Gallup.
[02:10:42.661 --> 02:10:44.222]  Nobody gets that.
[02:10:44.222 --> 02:10:45.723]  It's over 70 nationwide.
[02:10:45.723 --> 02:10:54.689]  Do you go for the one bird in the hand or the 5,000 birds in the bush?
[02:10:54.689 --> 02:11:00.112]  Even if he loses, which he probably would, the educational opportunity, the platform,
[02:11:01.442 --> 02:11:05.084]  I was going to get into a bunch of other issues with Ron Poldemar, but obviously I'm going to be raising this.
[02:11:05.084 --> 02:11:06.005]  So that's coming up.
[02:11:06.005 --> 02:11:07.186]  Huge article.
[02:11:07.186 --> 02:11:10.348]  Health authorities want depression-causing drugs added to the water supply.
[02:11:10.348 --> 02:11:11.909]  This is actually happening.
[02:11:11.909 --> 02:11:14.611]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:11:14.611 --> 02:11:28.420]  I've got to say, my writers, Aaron Dykes, Curt Nemo, Jason Douglas, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, they're all on fire with the incredible job they're doing, the amount of piercing articles they're writing every day.
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:29.181]  But I want to
[02:11:31.178 --> 02:11:35.071]  I'm going to take some calls for a while, then I'll start getting into all that news, because I haven't been taking a lot of calls lately.
[02:11:36.254 --> 02:11:44.059]  But before I do that, there were a couple news articles written yesterday that are so important that people need to see to get the full spectrum of what's happening.
[02:11:44.059 --> 02:11:47.982]  China Plants Flag on Constitution Avenue, Curt Nimmo.
[02:11:47.982 --> 02:11:54.146]  And the other one by Paul Watson and Alex Jones, Meet the New Boss China Owns the United States.
[02:11:54.146 --> 02:11:57.888]  But then you read deeper, they're just the receivership arm of the banks.
[02:11:57.888 --> 02:11:59.349]  They're a shell corporation.
[02:11:59.349 --> 02:12:05.814]  So China wouldn't be this big threat if there weren't insiders in our country that had made treasonous, traitorous deals with them.
[02:12:06.534 --> 02:12:08.798]  And this is all on record in these two articles.
[02:12:08.798 --> 02:12:14.786]  Now, I want these to be read and seen by folks, and they have been read and seen by a lot, but I want them to be seen by even more.
[02:12:14.786 --> 02:12:17.630]  So, let's make
[02:12:18.584 --> 02:12:23.986]  These articles, the number one and number two search terms, and you can choose which ones you think you should enter into Google over and over again.
[02:12:23.986 --> 02:12:25.666]  Do it 20, 30 times, you know.
[02:12:25.666 --> 02:12:30.067]  Type it in, then put a cursor in it as if it's a new search, and just hit Enter again.
[02:12:30.067 --> 02:12:31.868]  Click on the articles, email them out to folks.
[02:12:31.868 --> 02:12:35.629]  There's more than one way to skin a cat and get the word out.
[02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:43.071]  But let's do China New Boss.
[02:12:43.071 --> 02:12:46.292]  China New Boss, and that'll lead them to Meet the New Boss.
[02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:48.873]  China owns the United States.
[02:12:48.873 --> 02:12:51.995]  Let's do China New Boss.
[02:12:51.995 --> 02:12:56.998]  Three words, China New Boss, is one search term, China New Boss.
[02:12:56.998 --> 02:13:05.664]  And the secondary search term, after you're done entering that, if you want to reach millions more people, is China Plants Flag.
[02:13:05.664 --> 02:13:07.245]  I think that ought to be the number one search.
[02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:09.106]  China Plants Flag.
[02:13:09.106 --> 02:13:14.030]  And you go to Google, go to Yahoo, whatever you choose, enter it over and over and over again.
[02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:16.872]  You know, while you're there at your coffee break or whatever at work.
[02:13:17.717 --> 02:13:24.644]  And in just a few minutes, I mean, in fact, guys, give me a document cam shot for presentplanet.tv viewers, because I get emails about this.
[02:13:24.644 --> 02:13:26.546]  Some folks understand what I'm talking about.
[02:13:26.546 --> 02:13:30.950]  Or not even a document cam shot, with a document cam, show them my monitor across there, please.
[02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:34.874]  I'm going to show, or you guys can do it live, I guess, on Google.
[02:13:34.874 --> 02:13:36.116]  All you do is go to Google.
[02:13:37.173 --> 02:13:39.675]  Using this Pentagon tool against the globalist.
[02:13:39.675 --> 02:13:44.119]  Again, I'm not even against the Pentagon, but it's been created and controlled by the offshore banks.
[02:13:44.119 --> 02:13:53.588]  And you go there, and you simply type in, and I know most of you know this, but some people get confused by it, because they sit there and try to retype in the whole line over and over again.
[02:13:53.588 --> 02:13:54.729]  You don't have to do that.
[02:13:54.729 --> 02:13:58.373]  And you just type in, where did my article go?
[02:13:58.373 --> 02:13:58.813]  There it is.
[02:13:58.813 --> 02:14:00.314]  China plants flags.
[02:14:00.314 --> 02:14:01.976]  So, China
[02:14:07.330 --> 02:14:19.614]  And then after you hit enter, you see the top search, InfoWars.com, second search, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:14:19.614 --> 02:14:22.235]  And then all you do is you click News.
[02:14:22.235 --> 02:14:24.496]  This is one way to enter it over and over again.
[02:14:24.496 --> 02:14:25.917]  You hit Web.
[02:14:25.917 --> 02:14:27.137]  You hit Images.
[02:14:27.137 --> 02:14:28.398]  You hit Videos.
[02:14:28.398 --> 02:14:29.818]  You hit Shopping.
[02:14:29.818 --> 02:14:31.259]  You hit Gmail.
[02:14:31.259 --> 02:14:31.959]  You hit More.
[02:14:32.947 --> 02:14:36.769]  You go back, because every time you're doing this, it's researching it.
[02:14:36.769 --> 02:14:39.550]  You understand that?
[02:14:39.550 --> 02:14:46.894]  You could just sit there and click links up here with that search term in there and do it over and over and over again without having some artificial engine that does this for you.
[02:14:46.894 --> 02:14:48.575]  Or you can go up and plant a cursor.
[02:14:48.575 --> 02:14:50.076]  I'll show folks.
[02:14:50.076 --> 02:14:52.237]  You plant a cursor in the middle of China plants.
[02:14:52.237 --> 02:14:54.819]  Of course, I might want to spell that right.
[02:14:54.819 --> 02:14:55.939]  I hadn't looked at what I'd spelled.
[02:14:55.939 --> 02:15:01.162]  It's hard to talk and walk and chew gum at the same time here.
[02:15:04.645 --> 02:15:06.767]  Okay.
[02:15:06.767 --> 02:15:12.072]  And so once you have China plants flag, you just put a cursor in it and then you hit return.
[02:15:12.072 --> 02:15:15.455]  And then you go up and replace the cursor and you hit return.
[02:15:15.455 --> 02:15:27.687]  And each time it re-enters it, and that's the most effective way to do that, is to... You guys don't have a cursor on it, so it's not gonna search.
[02:15:27.687 --> 02:15:29.308]  You plant a cursor and do it.
[02:15:29.308 --> 02:15:29.769]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:15:32.389 --> 02:15:35.892]  So that's how you get the word out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:35.892 --> 02:15:37.774]  And it's very, very effective.
[02:15:37.774 --> 02:15:42.698]  And so I hope people will search the term China Plants Flag.
[02:15:42.698 --> 02:15:46.221]  And then the other one, meet China New Boss.
[02:15:46.221 --> 02:15:48.483]  China New Boss and China Plants Flag.
[02:15:49.697 --> 02:15:56.903]  And we will certainly expose to people exactly what's going on with the globalists on that front.
[02:15:56.903 --> 02:16:05.851]  Let's take 20 minutes of calls or so, then I'm getting into Obama's frightening anti-gun agenda, which he's emboldened by his 15-point bump.
[02:16:05.851 --> 02:16:07.752]  Watson had another article about that today.
[02:16:07.752 --> 02:16:11.716]  Remember, all last year I kept saying all these White House advisors and pollsters
[02:16:12.256 --> 02:16:24.392]  Kept saying Obama needs a crisis, a tragedy, an Oklahoma City, a 9-11, something to pose as our savior, something to pose as the protector, the comforter.
[02:16:24.392 --> 02:16:26.715]  And now he has a 15-point bump in Gallup.
[02:16:27.597 --> 02:16:34.263]  It'll be short-lived, it'll last a few weeks, but still, imagine what a city being nuked would do.
[02:16:34.263 --> 02:16:45.153]  And then they've got their whole police state set up, and even cops who know what's going on with the New World Order and military will still just, I know Alex, I know it's bad, but we're taking the guns, the Al Qaeda hit Chicago.
[02:16:45.153 --> 02:16:48.376]  And let me tell you something, if they nuke Chicago or D.C.
[02:16:48.376 --> 02:16:52.580]  or Dallas or something, even set a little one off, they are going to come arrest me.
[02:16:53.371 --> 02:16:54.092]  I don't know.
[02:17:13.507 --> 02:17:41.784]  The day they nerve gas a city, the day they blow up 15 buildings, you know, they can do a grab bag of things, the day they have 500 pipe bombs detonate simultaneously and they trot out some mentally retarded Patsy on TV, the day they do that, you've got to hit the streets at night with hundreds of flyers saying, stage terror to take your rights, you've got to call into all the talk radio that day, you've got to call Congress, you've got to have a huge buzz that it was staged, banner hangs on highways, you name it.
[02:17:42.344 --> 02:17:58.808]  They can't get all of you, but if they're able to shut down the big alternative media, when the offshore globalists stage these big events that they're clearly gearing up for, if you just kind of cower down and wait and see what happens, they're going to win.
[02:17:58.808 --> 02:18:01.828]  Or at least win that big round of takeover.
[02:18:01.828 --> 02:18:06.569]  And then we are into actual full-blown resistance.
[02:18:06.569 --> 02:18:09.650]  But if you all charge out, like we did with the shooting,
[02:18:10.484 --> 02:18:14.787]  And expose that it was a fraud and that they were capitalizing on it politically.
[02:18:14.787 --> 02:18:18.129]  That blew up in their face.
[02:18:18.129 --> 02:18:19.070]  It helped Obama.
[02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:21.111]  The Democrats' approval rating even went down more.
[02:18:21.111 --> 02:18:25.374]  The Republicans have gone way above Obama because Boehner did something he said he would do.
[02:18:25.374 --> 02:18:26.014]  Wow!
[02:18:26.014 --> 02:18:26.694]  How novel is that?
[02:18:26.694 --> 02:18:32.078]  And they repealed the health care law, but only in the House.
[02:18:32.078 --> 02:18:34.299]  Oh, because they knew they wouldn't have the votes in the Senate.
[02:18:34.299 --> 02:18:38.182]  I wonder if they had the votes in the Senate if Boehner would have done that.
[02:18:38.182 --> 02:18:39.543]  Let's see what happens.
[02:18:41.021 --> 02:18:43.282]  But I'm not trying to scare people.
[02:18:43.282 --> 02:18:50.945]  Not facing how much trouble we're in is what is going to allow the situation to really deteriorate into a full-bore hot tyranny.
[02:18:50.945 --> 02:18:59.349]  We're going from a cold tyranny that's been creeping and taking its time making preparations to a galloping tyranny now going into a full sprint.
[02:19:00.245 --> 02:19:05.167]  And you can see the preparations just waxing, intensifying on every front.
[02:19:05.167 --> 02:19:09.469]  And I haven't sacrificed my name, my family, everything I am.
[02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:13.591]  I haven't put everything on the table because I think we can't win.
[02:19:13.591 --> 02:19:22.875]  I know historically, I know in my gut, I know in my spirit, I know intellectually, I know historically on every front, I know we can and we must win.
[02:19:23.675 --> 02:19:26.716]  This global crime syndicate is going to give us no quarter.
[02:19:26.716 --> 02:19:30.277]  They're not going to just dominate us and boss hog us and steal some money.
[02:19:30.277 --> 02:19:32.018]  That's already been going on forever.
[02:19:32.018 --> 02:19:37.460]  This is a hot, vicious, sickening tyranny.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:40.041]  And it's all or nothing.
[02:19:40.041 --> 02:19:42.402]  It's the equivalent of Lenin trying to take power in 1917.
[02:19:42.402 --> 02:19:46.624]  It's the equivalent of Hitler trying to take power in 1933.
[02:19:48.885 --> 02:19:49.766]  That's even worse than that.
[02:19:49.766 --> 02:19:51.188]  It's like 1937 Germany.
[02:19:51.188 --> 02:19:53.571]  I mean, we've got to stand up and be bold now.
[02:19:53.571 --> 02:19:58.957]  If we go along with this, folks, you're going to lose your pension funds, your stock market, your private property.
[02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:00.699]  They'll have a fake narrative of how you deserve it.
[02:20:01.527 --> 02:20:04.449]  Do you have more than four hot flash episodes a day?
[02:20:04.449 --> 02:20:06.851]  Do you ever wake up at night soaked in sweat?
[02:20:06.851 --> 02:20:11.994]  Do you experience mood swings, heightened emotions, or sometimes feel on the verge of tears?
[02:20:11.994 --> 02:20:14.316]  Have you gained more than five pounds?
[02:20:14.316 --> 02:20:17.338]  Have you lost the energy level you had before menopause?
[02:20:17.338 --> 02:20:20.140]  Do you have low libido or no interest at all?
[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:28.306]  If you said yes to any of these questions, you may be suffering with severe menopause symptoms and you qualify to receive a free month's supply of Ambarin.
[02:20:28.786 --> 02:20:33.148]  Ambren is the incredibly effective, all-natural solution for menopause relief.

[02:20:48.516 --> 02:20:50.677]  That's ambrentrial.com.
[02:20:50.677 --> 02:20:51.237]  Or call 1-800-318-8232.
[02:20:54.719 --> 02:20:55.119]  That's 1-800-318-8232.
[02:20:55.119 --> 02:20:55.259]  1-800-318-8232.
[02:20:55.259 --> 02:20:55.559]  Good day.
[02:20:55.559 --> 02:20:57.380]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:20:57.380 --> 02:20:57.860]  January 20th, 2011.
[02:20:57.860 --> 02:20:59.181]  Gold opened this morning at $13.5960.
[02:20:59.181 --> 02:21:02.662]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $13.9495, $6.9748 for a half ounce, or $3.4874 for a quarter ounce.
[02:21:02.662 --> 02:21:02.962]  That's $13.9495, $6.9748, or $3.4874.
[02:21:20.908 --> 02:21:24.750]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:25.890]  debt crises.
[02:21:25.890 --> 02:21:28.071]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[02:21:28.071 --> 02:21:30.492]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:30.492 --> 02:21:35.834]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:35.834 --> 02:21:42.797]  Hi, Ted Anderson, the Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:42.797 --> 02:21:48.639]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[02:21:48.959 --> 02:21:50.720]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:53.222]  I'll send it free.
[02:21:53.222 --> 02:21:56.445]  Again, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:56.445 --> 02:22:00.048]  Ask for the CBO document.
[02:22:00.048 --> 02:22:01.249]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.249 --> 02:22:03.631]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:03.631 --> 02:22:05.833]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:05.833 --> 02:22:09.155]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:09.155 --> 02:22:14.259]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:14.259 --> 02:22:18.463]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.743 --> 02:22:21.105]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.105 --> 02:22:23.646]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.646 --> 02:22:26.908]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.908 --> 02:22:34.513]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:40.235]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.235 --> 02:22:43.097]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.097 --> 02:22:46.780]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:47.841]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:47.841 --> 02:22:49.182]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:49.182 --> 02:22:50.684]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:02.315 --> 02:23:03.556]  This is not a drill.
[02:23:03.556 --> 02:23:06.057]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:23:06.057 --> 02:23:07.959]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:23:07.959 --> 02:23:15.183]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:23:15.183 --> 02:23:19.566]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:23:19.566 --> 02:23:29.873]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.

[02:23:30.813 --> 02:23:31.694]  Right now!
[02:23:31.694 --> 02:23:32.214]  Right now!
[02:24:05.402 --> 02:24:09.626]  You look like an angel.
[02:24:09.626 --> 02:24:13.549]  Walk like an angel.
[02:24:13.549 --> 02:24:16.131]  Talk like an angel.
[02:24:16.131 --> 02:24:18.213]  But I got one.
[02:24:18.213 --> 02:24:18.433]  Who?
[02:24:18.433 --> 02:24:19.894]  Gentiles?
[02:24:19.894 --> 02:24:22.036]  You're the devil in disguise.
[02:24:22.036 --> 02:24:25.579]  No, he's a little angel cake, our media says.
[02:24:25.579 --> 02:24:29.602]  One tip for info warriors out there that want to help in the fight against the globalists.
[02:24:29.602 --> 02:24:30.623]  I've got a great
[02:24:33.462 --> 02:24:34.162]  I think so.
[02:24:57.270 --> 02:25:00.573]  I mean, that is an amazing, amazing story.
[02:25:00.573 --> 02:25:02.234]  All this fluoride news.
[02:25:02.234 --> 02:25:04.556]  I mean, it's all so important.
[02:25:04.556 --> 02:25:09.320]  I hope people realize that globalists are constantly talking about shutting down free speech.
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:10.581]  We're hurting them.
[02:25:10.581 --> 02:25:15.045]  People shouldn't take the internet and talk radio and the free media for granted.
[02:25:15.045 --> 02:25:16.986]  The dinosaur media is dying.
[02:25:16.986 --> 02:25:20.009]  The government is discredited in the middle of all their crimes.
[02:25:20.009 --> 02:25:23.772]  They are moving against us because we are having victories.
[02:25:25.393 --> 02:25:28.714]  John, Bob, Sunfest, Joe, Jonathan, I'm getting to all of you.
[02:25:28.714 --> 02:25:31.215]  John, you're on the air from Texas.
[02:25:31.215 --> 02:25:31.615]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:31.615 --> 02:25:33.236]  Hey, buddy.
[02:25:33.236 --> 02:25:39.759]  During Christmas time, I was talking to my sister-in-law and her husband, and they both work for the Ford Motor Company.
[02:25:39.759 --> 02:25:46.301]  And they were telling me about all the people they're training to send to China to help set up their automotive plants there.
[02:25:46.301 --> 02:25:47.862]  And I said, they're crazy.
[02:25:47.862 --> 02:25:49.962]  I said, they're crazy to go over there.
[02:25:49.962 --> 02:25:50.243]  I said,
[02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:58.733]  During the 1930s, the Ford Motor Company sent people into Communist Russia to help good old Uncle Joe Stalin set up their automotive plants.
[02:25:58.733 --> 02:26:03.135]  And when the purges started, they were all arrested and either worked to death in slave labor camps or shot out of hand.
[02:26:03.135 --> 02:26:04.055]  They said they're crazy to do that.
[02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:06.516]  Same thing with Adolf Adolf Hitler.
[02:26:06.516 --> 02:26:12.838]  And those Ford and GM plants were not allowed to be bombed in Germany during the war, and that is on record.
[02:26:12.838 --> 02:26:17.240]  They had to keep building those materials, so the big banks made money on both ends.
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:18.120]  Well, that's another issue.
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:19.381]  They're training their replacements.
[02:26:20.368 --> 02:26:22.610]  I tell you, this country's in so much trouble.
[02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:24.972]  Can you imagine China with the slave labor?
[02:26:24.972 --> 02:26:28.275]  And on top of it, we're going to have carbon taxes, but they won't?
[02:26:28.275 --> 02:26:29.636]  You think we don't have jobs now?
[02:26:29.636 --> 02:26:33.639]  I mean, this government and Obama's promising us lots of jobs.
[02:26:33.639 --> 02:26:36.562]  Hu Jintao, he came over to give us jobs.
[02:26:36.562 --> 02:26:37.322]  He likes us.
[02:26:37.322 --> 02:26:39.324]  One more thing real quick, Alex.
[02:26:39.324 --> 02:26:40.685]  I think I told you about this before.
[02:26:40.685 --> 02:26:45.409]  There was a YouTube video up that showed the Chinese and the Russians on joint military maneuvers.
[02:26:45.908 --> 02:26:51.137]  And when it was over with they had a great big rally and the general was talking to them and kept calling them world peacekeepers.
[02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:55.021]  I think the world peacekeepers are... No, no, no.
[02:26:55.021 --> 02:26:56.641]  Sir, that's all official.
[02:26:56.641 --> 02:27:04.763]  Under the agreements, under the UN, they are... People... It's an NLE09 and NLEO10 under FEMA that they're training foreign troops for America.
[02:27:04.763 --> 02:27:06.503]  I've been to the drills.
[02:27:06.503 --> 02:27:07.784]  It's real.
[02:27:07.784 --> 02:27:10.144]  That's why they're putting Chinese flags up everywhere.
[02:27:10.144 --> 02:27:13.585]  And Times Square's been turned into nothing but Chinese ads.
[02:27:13.585 --> 02:27:15.706]  And the Empire State's building's lit up.
[02:27:15.706 --> 02:27:16.786]  They're getting us ready.
[02:27:17.426 --> 02:27:21.611]  Did you just hear Jerome Corsi about the Hemispheric Travel ID?
[02:27:21.611 --> 02:27:25.776]  That's legalization by fiat right there!
[02:27:25.776 --> 02:27:28.138]  Well Alex, all I can say is I think the hour is getting late.
[02:27:28.138 --> 02:27:31.102]  We better hurry up and get things done or else it's going to be too late.
[02:27:31.741 --> 02:27:35.523]  Well, you know, people, a lot of people call me, John, they say, Alex, please do this, please do that.
[02:27:35.523 --> 02:27:37.004]  I'm completely overwhelmed.
[02:27:37.004 --> 02:27:38.585]  I'm just here trying to rally people.
[02:27:38.585 --> 02:27:40.646]  I believe in the citizens of this country.
[02:27:40.646 --> 02:27:43.768]  And I mean, what?
[02:27:43.768 --> 02:27:48.691]  I mean, everybody, this is like inviting Hitler here and worshipping him with this Hu Jintao.
[02:27:48.691 --> 02:27:50.452]  That tells us who our government is.
[02:27:50.452 --> 02:27:51.593]  And I agree with you.
[02:27:51.593 --> 02:27:54.295]  The hour's late, John, and it's just going to get more crazy from here.
[02:27:54.295 --> 02:27:56.476]  Are people noticing how fast it's all moving now?
[02:27:56.476 --> 02:27:57.317]  Exactly as we said?
[02:27:58.417 --> 02:28:08.344]  All I did was read what David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Club of Rome, the UN, the RAND Corporation, Henry Kissinger said!
[02:28:08.344 --> 02:28:09.985]  I'm risking my life doing this, folks.
[02:28:09.985 --> 02:28:13.167]  This stuff's real!
[02:28:13.167 --> 02:28:14.548]  Bob in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:28:14.548 --> 02:28:14.988]  Go ahead.
[02:28:14.988 --> 02:28:19.671]  Hey, thank you, Alex Jones.
[02:28:20.546 --> 02:28:23.450]  This is old Hebrews 9, Bob.
[02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:26.514]  I was with you in Austin 2010.
[02:28:26.514 --> 02:28:29.918]  I was with you recently here on the radio 1020.
[02:28:29.918 --> 02:28:31.139]  No, no, I remember.
[02:28:31.139 --> 02:28:33.763]  You're a preacher.
[02:28:33.763 --> 02:28:35.425]  You came and preached to me at the gun show.
[02:28:36.161 --> 02:28:39.205]  I tried to get you to look at Hebrews 9.
[02:28:39.205 --> 02:28:41.889]  You just talked about being completely overwhelmed.
[02:28:41.889 --> 02:28:43.411]  I met you.
[02:28:43.411 --> 02:28:48.057]  You talked a couple of days before about being in your house at 4 a.m.
[02:28:48.057 --> 02:28:49.539]  in the morning, and I said,
[02:28:51.201 --> 02:28:54.205]  Alex is talking about this Hebrews 9.
[02:28:54.205 --> 02:28:56.148]  This is what sovereignty is.
[02:28:56.148 --> 02:29:00.053]  You talked about your little seven-year-old boy reading the Bible.
[02:29:00.053 --> 02:29:05.200]  The last time I was on this program, I tried my best to get people to get serious.
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:06.561]  Okay, well read Hebrews 9 to us.
[02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:07.002]  Go ahead.
[02:29:08.684 --> 02:29:11.627]  So that they can see what it's saying.
[02:29:11.627 --> 02:29:13.468]  I don't want to talk about what it's saying.
[02:29:13.468 --> 02:29:14.929]  I want them to read it.
[02:29:14.929 --> 02:29:20.574]  Because when they're reading, the God that you've been talking about, you just got to say, and I'm completely overwhelmed.
[02:29:20.574 --> 02:29:30.562]  I think you're trying to put things in the hand of God, and I want to tell... Well no, that's what I woke up in the middle of the night last night, with this overwhelming drive that we should repent.
[02:29:32.704 --> 02:29:35.927]  Because repenting means we're recognizing the error of our ways.
[02:29:35.927 --> 02:29:38.569]  We're recognizing that we're involved in evil.
[02:29:38.569 --> 02:29:43.193]  That this country is being overtaken by evil.
[02:29:43.193 --> 02:29:44.214]  Stay there.
[02:29:44.214 --> 02:29:50.439]  I want you to read Hebrews 9 when we come back, or at least part of it, because the spoken word is the written word.
[02:29:50.439 --> 02:29:51.960]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:53.341]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.341 --> 02:29:55.883]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.883 --> 02:29:58.545]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.547 --> 02:30:06.090]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:06.090 --> 02:30:07.011]  Number 1.
[02:30:07.011 --> 02:30:10.433]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.433 --> 02:30:11.294]  Number 2.
[02:30:11.294 --> 02:30:16.197]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.197 --> 02:30:16.937]  It's true.
[02:30:16.937 --> 02:30:21.801]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.801 --> 02:30:22.641]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.641 --> 02:30:26.223]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.223 --> 02:30:29.926]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.126 --> 02:30:30.906]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.906 --> 02:30:33.667]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.667 --> 02:30:37.349]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:38.149]  Number 5.
[02:30:38.149 --> 02:30:42.291]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.291 --> 02:30:47.353]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:33:10.134 --> 02:33:25.631]  Well, I won't back down No, I won't back down You can stand me up at the gates of hell But I won't back down
[02:33:27.079 --> 02:33:29.340]  There's no easy way out, folks.
[02:33:55.715 --> 02:34:01.917]  There can be no doubt that we are headed into serious bondage, like almost every other nation in the world.
[02:34:01.917 --> 02:34:05.838]  Adverse-filled, very wicked people are taking over our society.
[02:34:05.838 --> 02:34:09.960]  And I, last night and about 4 a.m., I woke up, went back to sleep.
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:13.762]  And again, I'm not somebody that quote, Bible thumps.
[02:34:13.762 --> 02:34:21.888]  I'm not somebody who likes these big establishment Christian churches and their New World Order promotion, their pro-war promotion, their globalist lies.
[02:34:21.888 --> 02:34:27.992]  But I'm talking about my personal heart, my personal soul, and I don't claim to be a perfect great person.
[02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:30.934]  I got a heavy load of flesh in the world.
[02:34:30.934 --> 02:34:32.315]  I'm tied into it.
[02:34:32.315 --> 02:34:33.596]  I mean, I know all about it.
[02:34:34.522 --> 02:34:39.904]  But it's because I do have that knowledge that I can see how good God's plan is and we'll follow it.
[02:34:39.904 --> 02:34:45.666]  America's never been perfect, but we followed that plan more than anybody else and look at how we were blessed.
[02:34:45.666 --> 02:34:47.767]  Now all the blessings are leaving.
[02:34:47.767 --> 02:34:48.907]  We are going into bondage.
[02:34:48.907 --> 02:34:55.549]  And even if you're an atheist, you become blinded by not realizing there's more out there in the world.
[02:34:55.549 --> 02:34:57.490]  Things cultures have all experienced.
[02:34:58.696 --> 02:35:07.241]  So many scientists now studying the brain are becoming religious as they discover that societies and groups who have never known each other are having the same experience.
[02:35:07.241 --> 02:35:13.224]  I'm getting some scientists on the next few weeks to talk about that.
[02:35:13.224 --> 02:35:17.006]  And, well, the issue here is that
[02:35:18.109 --> 02:35:25.252]  If we can't repent, and by repent, recognize that we let 51 million babies be aborted.
[02:35:25.252 --> 02:35:33.375]  Black people and the liberal death that they were sold have accepted 52% of blacks not being born since Roe v. Wade.
[02:35:33.375 --> 02:35:34.776]  Where are their black leaders?
[02:35:34.776 --> 02:35:40.658]  Somebody calls them a name, they run around and scream on TV, but they don't get mad about more than half their people being killed.
[02:35:41.684 --> 02:35:42.505]  We need to repent.
[02:35:42.505 --> 02:35:50.151]  We need to repent, conservatives out there, who supported these wars based on lies and think that death is cool and torture is cool.
[02:35:50.151 --> 02:35:52.933]  You are buying into evil.
[02:35:52.933 --> 02:35:56.736]  And when you allow evil to be done to others, it will come back on you.
[02:35:56.736 --> 02:35:58.278]  In this life.
[02:35:58.278 --> 02:35:59.158]  In this life.
[02:35:59.158 --> 02:36:00.579]  You reap what you sow.
[02:36:01.901 --> 02:36:08.245]  And it's just a fact of life, a fact of the universe, and you can see the storm we're already in.
[02:36:08.245 --> 02:36:09.606]  It's only getting stronger.
[02:36:09.606 --> 02:36:11.046]  It's only getting more crazy.
[02:36:11.046 --> 02:36:13.408]  And the lies, as they tell us, the economy's great.
[02:36:13.408 --> 02:36:15.949]  When it's admitted, on the other hand, it's falling apart.
[02:36:15.949 --> 02:36:21.893]  And the globalists who've engineered this offer more of the same poison as the cure.
[02:36:21.893 --> 02:36:27.936]  But just briefly, because I need to get to other callers, and it's always good to hear from you when you get in a few times a year, Bob in Texas.
[02:36:27.936 --> 02:36:29.617]  I got Hebrew 9 in front of me, and
[02:36:31.970 --> 02:36:35.852]  I mean, specifically, if you want to read this passage, or what area of Hebrews now?
[02:36:35.852 --> 02:36:37.732]  Are you talking about the whole thing you want folks to read?
[02:36:37.732 --> 02:36:42.654]  Okay, Aaron, I mean, Alex, more simple than that.
[02:36:42.654 --> 02:36:45.895]  These words are a word picture.
[02:36:45.895 --> 02:36:49.537]  It's not going to help for me to read them to somebody to listen.
[02:36:49.537 --> 02:36:54.219]  As a person reads, he will see the picture.
[02:36:54.219 --> 02:36:57.920]  You notice in verse 16 and 17, it says you have a will and testament.
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:09.885]  After the testator dies, nobody's bothered to go over and find out what Jesus did when he died in verse 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.
[02:37:09.885 --> 02:37:12.407]  He tells us what he did, what he accomplished.
[02:37:12.407 --> 02:37:14.568]  But it points after he dies.
[02:37:14.568 --> 02:37:22.331]  So after he dies, you find out, just like Will Testament today, after you die, the Will and Testaments follow.
[02:37:22.331 --> 02:37:23.952]  You don't call the probate court.
[02:37:24.352 --> 02:37:26.614]  You don't get a lawyer or somebody.
[02:37:26.614 --> 02:37:30.317]  You go and read that will and you find out about the estate.
[02:37:30.317 --> 02:37:31.618]  You find out what the plan is.
[02:37:31.618 --> 02:37:33.600]  You talked about a plan a while ago.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.281]  You talked about repentance.
[02:37:35.281 --> 02:37:41.006]  It's unfolded 50 days later in Acts 2.
[02:37:41.006 --> 02:37:44.449]  And then later it talks about this repentance and everybody's ignoring it.
[02:37:44.449 --> 02:37:45.750]  Look at it in 2 Timothy 2, 24 and 25.
[02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:47.151]  It says you've got a person to be taught.
[02:37:50.359 --> 02:37:57.647]  And the Lord, through teaching, helps you to acknowledge the truth, and He helps you in bringing about repentance.
[02:37:57.647 --> 02:38:00.090]  You see that unfolded in Acts 2.
[02:38:00.090 --> 02:38:04.314]  That's why I mentioned Hebrews 9 and Acts 2.
[02:38:04.314 --> 02:38:06.697]  Never mind somebody reading it to you.
[02:38:06.697 --> 02:38:07.317]  Read it.
[02:38:07.317 --> 02:38:08.759]  It's a word picture.
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:18.605]  And you've been very bold the last few days about saying that energy is the power of freedom.
[02:38:18.605 --> 02:38:24.509]  You're going to have to get the energy in order to have freedom to be free.
[02:38:24.509 --> 02:38:28.631]  And I'm telling you, we've got something greater than zero energy.
[02:38:28.631 --> 02:38:33.474]  It's this eternal energy that's expressed by that great Creator.
[02:38:34.175 --> 02:38:44.231]  In his will and testament through his son who's the mediator and the testator and there ain't no qualified probate lawyers around.
[02:38:45.419 --> 02:38:58.569]  Well, I mean, to simplify it, we need to admit that we are hurtling towards corruption, that we are inherently fallen, and by admitting that, we can then reach for something greater.
[02:38:58.569 --> 02:39:12.839]  And we need to ask God to lead God and direct us against this evil, and to give us the courage and the focus, and to realize that everybody has gifts, and there are people out there who it is your destiny, if you'll take it in your hands, and follow God's program, to stand up against evil.
[02:39:13.599 --> 02:39:20.064]  And you know, the world comes at you and says, well, you gotta do it perfect, or you gotta have all the answers, you gotta have a simple overnight fix.
[02:39:20.064 --> 02:39:29.011]  No, it's simply setting your will against corruption and making the personal decision every day to try to be a better person and to try to stand up against evil.
[02:39:29.011 --> 02:39:35.897]  And it is in the saying no to corruption in your own life and everywhere else that you begin to see that change in the world.
[02:39:35.897 --> 02:39:38.439]  And God bless you, I appreciate you joining us.
[02:39:38.439 --> 02:39:40.621]  And folks, they say there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:39:41.684 --> 02:39:44.607]  Look, whatever you're going to do out there, we're going in the wrong direction.
[02:39:44.607 --> 02:39:48.232]  People better gear up and get focused.
[02:39:48.232 --> 02:39:51.636]  And, you know, if you don't believe in God, that's your issue.
[02:39:51.636 --> 02:39:58.784]  Tonight, when you get home from work, go in your bedroom, close the door, sit down in a chair and spend 30 minutes quietly
[02:39:59.545 --> 02:40:13.672]  Thinking about the state of affairs in this world, and thinking about the government, and thinking about the media, and thinking about society, and think about the stream we're in, the river we've gotten into, and where it's leading us.
[02:40:13.672 --> 02:40:14.792]  I mean, look around you.
[02:40:14.792 --> 02:40:16.993]  Look at how deep we've already gotten into this.
[02:40:16.993 --> 02:40:19.314]  I mean, we've got to get off this road.
[02:40:19.314 --> 02:40:20.575]  We've got to get off this path.
[02:40:20.575 --> 02:40:26.778]  We have got, and it starts by just getting out of the water and standing on the side and going, do I want to keep going downstream?
[02:40:26.778 --> 02:40:28.779]  Is this the road, the canal,
[02:40:29.259 --> 02:40:43.523]  I want to be on, because let me tell you, the ocean it leads to, and we're getting very close to that ocean, is an ocean of pain, an ocean of humiliation, an ocean of wickedness that enjoys attacking anything good.
[02:40:43.523 --> 02:40:44.244]  It's that simple.
[02:40:44.244 --> 02:40:49.745]  The globalists, regardless of what you want to believe about the world, you study the globalists, they hate good things.
[02:40:49.745 --> 02:40:50.986]  They hate strength.
[02:40:50.986 --> 02:40:52.486]  They hate anything honorable.
[02:40:52.486 --> 02:40:53.666]  They want to hurt you.
[02:40:53.666 --> 02:40:57.007]  They want to dumb you down so they can dominate you.
[02:40:57.007 --> 02:40:58.528]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:40:59.711 --> 02:41:01.212]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:41:01.212 --> 02:41:08.896]  And they've got so many good men and women worldwide working for them through compartmentalization so that you don't see what you're a larger part of.
[02:41:08.896 --> 02:41:09.916]  Recognize it.
[02:41:09.916 --> 02:41:12.718]  Make a decision.
[02:41:12.718 --> 02:41:18.001]  And this is such a big issue, I don't even feel worthy to be here, you know, telling people to get their house in order.
[02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.721]  I need to get my house in order.
[02:41:19.721 --> 02:41:20.522]  I try every day.
[02:41:21.638 --> 02:41:34.384]  And compared to most people, I'm a very moral person, very pious person compared to most people, but I can still see who I am, the thoughts I have, the things I do, the way I deceive myself.
[02:41:34.384 --> 02:41:45.369]  And all the COINTELPRO, the infighting, the disinformation, the divide and conquer, the New World Order forces you into their paradigm.
[02:41:45.369 --> 02:41:49.731]  Like, I'm the guy that said 12, 14 years ago, get out of the left-right paradigm.
[02:41:50.848 --> 02:41:59.753]  That's now a maxim, a understood meme globally.
[02:41:59.753 --> 02:42:05.255]  That's an example of the power of the individual seeing an inherent truth that others weren't recognizing and speaking it.
[02:42:05.255 --> 02:42:09.357]  How the system was dividing us, how they were playing us off against each other.
[02:42:09.357 --> 02:42:11.679]  Carol Quigley said use that against the population.
[02:42:11.679 --> 02:42:13.059]  He didn't call it left-right paradigm.
[02:42:13.059 --> 02:42:14.220]  He said give them false choices.
[02:42:18.203 --> 02:42:28.572]  But to respond to the left-right paradigm where they come and say conservatives caused the shooting, then you've got to come out and say, no, conservatives didn't, this guy was a liberal.
[02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:41.304]  And now you're debating within their controlled paradigm when the whole system is just to get us to fight with each other and then blame our rights that we all share as if they are the fount, the progenitor, the engine.
[02:42:42.813 --> 02:42:48.658]  The creator of the problems when they are the solution.
[02:42:48.658 --> 02:42:55.463]  Everything this mainstream media, this global culture pushes is destructive.
[02:42:55.463 --> 02:42:57.265]  It's designed to confuse you.
[02:42:57.265 --> 02:43:00.007]  It's designed to destroy common sense.
[02:43:00.007 --> 02:43:02.829]  And most of the reporters, they're not even
[02:43:03.953 --> 02:43:06.674]  Consciously evil, serving the lie.
[02:43:06.674 --> 02:43:08.135]  They have been born into it.
[02:43:08.135 --> 02:43:09.995]  That's what's so dangerous about a tyranny.
[02:43:09.995 --> 02:43:11.436]  It takes a long time to grow.
[02:43:11.436 --> 02:43:15.898]  A societal de-evolution, a societal degeneration, a societal wickedness.
[02:43:17.031 --> 02:43:21.613]  And if that guy's shooting those people in Wicked, then, you know, first they teach you there is no good and evil.
[02:43:21.613 --> 02:43:25.394]  Well, somebody kidnapping a kid and torturing him to death, that isn't inherently evil?
[02:43:25.394 --> 02:43:26.754]  Does it hurt your heart?
[02:43:26.754 --> 02:43:27.775]  No, you know good and evil.
[02:43:27.775 --> 02:43:28.635]  It's real.
[02:43:28.635 --> 02:43:30.476]  First learn to recognize that.
[02:43:30.476 --> 02:43:32.856]  And once you can recognize that, everything else follows.
[02:43:32.856 --> 02:43:34.037]  But so many people can't.
[02:43:35.856 --> 02:43:51.723]  So many people can't recognize good from evil, and so many people that are in this global system and who are under deception, they just believe the lies so they regurgitate it, giving it force of will, force of power in this third dimension we all live in.
[02:43:51.723 --> 02:43:55.085]  Do you understand that?
[02:43:55.085 --> 02:43:56.406]  That's so fundamental.
[02:43:56.406 --> 02:44:03.309]  We're bound down by these chains of lies, of twisting of language, of the reduction of language.
[02:44:05.208 --> 02:44:10.053]  It doesn't matter if you're black, white, old, young, where you live in the world, what color you are.
[02:44:10.053 --> 02:44:20.103]  At the end of the day, we are all being programmed by an artificial, synthetic tyranny, a scientific dictatorship that has studied how humans operate and knows how to manipulate us.
[02:44:20.103 --> 02:44:25.628]  And only by studying the enemy's programming and how they operate can we triumph over it.
[02:44:25.628 --> 02:44:27.249]  Once you see their grid,
[02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:52.390]  It's unbelievable that anyone would fall for it, but then it's so complex when you're trying to communicate with people that have been so enslaved, including myself, that it's hard to even... It's almost like when you start trying to talk to somebody at work, or your wife, or your husband, or whoever, and you start talking, and they take the first three words of what you've said and jump to a conclusion, when you're talking about something completely different,
[02:44:53.376 --> 02:45:06.185]  They, and everyone does this, I do it, you jump to a conclusion when someone is saying something and then you start interrupting them, going with a line of reasoning or debate that isn't even pertaining to what they're saying.
[02:45:06.185 --> 02:45:08.687]  It's the same thing with semantics.
[02:45:08.687 --> 02:45:10.568]  What did George Orwell write about 1984?
[02:45:10.568 --> 02:45:18.034]  How they'd reduced the language down, how they changed the meaning of words, how they'd written a new language where it was almost impossible to communicate with people.
[02:45:19.076 --> 02:45:29.154]  He was a propaganda writer in reality and in that fictitious book, so he was a higher level guild, so he was one of the last vestiges of people still able to think.
[02:45:29.154 --> 02:45:32.019]  And so his guild was the most oppressed and watched.
[02:45:32.898 --> 02:45:37.162]  And that's who you are in the media out there, you Republican and conservative hacks.
[02:45:37.162 --> 02:45:49.733]  But it's the spirit of truth that will drive a Geraldo Rivera, who in his heart wants to be part of the truth, doesn't want to be a sellout, to come out and say 9-11 could be an inside job.
[02:45:49.733 --> 02:45:52.736]  And undoubtedly, fur was flying behind the scenes.
[02:45:52.736 --> 02:45:53.696]  And then Napolitano.
[02:45:54.517 --> 02:46:00.741]  Co-hosting for Beck, his own top-rated show on Fox Business, to say the whole thing's a lie on my show.
[02:46:00.741 --> 02:46:03.683]  There was stuff behind the scenes you wouldn't believe out of that.
[02:46:03.683 --> 02:46:08.947]  There was calls all over national media, including CNN for his firing, MSNBC.
[02:46:08.947 --> 02:46:13.330]  But he couldn't lie at the point that it mattered, because he's not stupid.
[02:46:13.330 --> 02:46:24.017]  He has intense, deep knowledge, and so he understands the truth innately, and even if it hurts his career, he couldn't lie when asked the question.
[02:46:25.037 --> 02:46:32.299]  But we have to go past the point of not lying when we're put on the stand in front of the court of public opinion.
[02:46:32.299 --> 02:46:37.460]  He told the truth when he was in that witness seat on this show.
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:39.400]  That isn't enough.
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:42.381]  But that's more than 99% of people of God.
[02:46:42.381 --> 02:46:49.302]  You need, when you have the opportunity to be a witness, not just when you're asked.
[02:46:49.302 --> 02:46:51.223]  And when you take that on,
[02:46:52.250 --> 02:46:53.964]  I mean, you know, a lot of people I understand.
[02:46:54.844 --> 02:47:03.266]  Well, people that have not been fulfilled in life and who have not been successful in life can see somebody like me and they cannot imagine that I'm real.
[02:47:03.266 --> 02:47:05.727]  They cannot imagine that I'm pure.
[02:47:05.727 --> 02:47:10.108]  They cannot imagine that this is actually happening because they don't have faith in themselves.
[02:47:10.108 --> 02:47:11.728]  They don't have faith in mankind.
[02:47:11.728 --> 02:47:21.731]  They can't believe that somebody came up, lifted themselves up by their bootstraps out of the middle of Texas and is now reaching millions of new people a day,
[02:47:22.831 --> 02:47:27.296]  Seriously damaging the globalist agenda.
[02:47:27.296 --> 02:47:33.742]  They can't believe that it could be real because they can't believe in themselves.
[02:47:33.742 --> 02:47:37.045]  And I'm telling you, believe in yourself.
[02:47:37.045 --> 02:47:38.727]  Believe in truth.
[02:47:38.727 --> 02:47:39.708]  Stand on it.
[02:47:39.708 --> 02:47:40.929]  Hold fast to it.
[02:47:40.929 --> 02:47:42.111]  The truth will set you free.
[02:47:44.420 --> 02:48:03.052]  And even if people can analyze Alex Jones, who's just another person, like everybody else, and find my faults, at my core, I love liberty, I want justice, I want a free world where our children and grandchildren can enjoy these technologies and do things we can't even imagine.
[02:48:03.052 --> 02:48:05.514]  My heart's in the right place.
[02:48:05.514 --> 02:48:10.958]  But if your heart's in the right place, and you can do it better, and you've got better ideas, do it!
[02:48:10.958 --> 02:48:12.159]  Show us!
[02:48:12.159 --> 02:48:13.139]  Lead us!
[02:48:13.139 --> 02:48:14.040]  By your example!
[02:48:15.299 --> 02:48:23.243]  That's all I ask, because I know the direction we're going is a nightmare.
[02:48:23.243 --> 02:48:24.883]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:48:24.883 --> 02:48:31.186]  And so let us not make it about the personalities, about Alex Jones or anybody else, because I don't want it to be about that.
[02:48:31.186 --> 02:48:34.028]  In a worldly sense, that is empowering for me.
[02:48:34.028 --> 02:48:36.749]  I don't want that worldly power.
[02:48:36.749 --> 02:48:41.591]  I don't want that ring of Mordor that corrupts, that cannot be used for good.
[02:48:41.591 --> 02:48:44.953]  I want you, the individual, to be empowered by my successful example.
[02:48:45.916 --> 02:48:54.459]  Which as scarred and stinking as it is, is the most successful thing in modern history.
[02:48:54.459 --> 02:48:58.620]  Next to the long 40-year road of Ron Paul.
[02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:00.601]  After that, it's the biggest thing there is.
[02:49:00.601 --> 02:49:04.262]  And it's not that big.
[02:49:04.262 --> 02:49:07.583]  It's power, and where it is big, is through you.
[02:49:07.583 --> 02:49:09.564]  You are the key.
[02:49:09.564 --> 02:49:10.864]  You are the secret.
[02:49:10.864 --> 02:49:13.225]  So don't let the enemy distract you or divert you.
[02:49:13.225 --> 02:49:15.006]  Take action, stand up, get involved today.
[02:49:15.987 --> 02:49:17.827]  And that's my testament on liberty.
[02:49:17.827 --> 02:49:19.568]  Let's talk to Sun Theft in California.
[02:49:19.568 --> 02:49:21.488]  You're on the air.
[02:49:21.488 --> 02:49:25.549]  But you have to be given a chance to tell the truth out of it, out of the nightmare.
[02:49:25.549 --> 02:49:38.231]  And I've worked on this all my life, using only those facts, not over-informed, under-educated, but just those facts that compile a solution.
[02:49:38.231 --> 02:49:41.592]  Only fasting, and Christ fasted, Buddha fasted, and so on.
[02:49:42.151 --> 02:49:48.759]  Only fasting can stop the fire out of control and the adrenaline behind the predator economy.
[02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:50.230]  Because that's all it is.
[02:49:50.230 --> 02:49:51.671]  Let me give you an example.
[02:49:51.671 --> 02:49:56.012]  Ma'am, you called us just a few days ago and you do call the office quite a bit and I understand.
[02:49:56.012 --> 02:49:59.333]  Why don't you write an article for us so we can look over it?
[02:49:59.333 --> 02:50:02.734]  And I do think fasting is important to detoxify the body.
[02:50:02.734 --> 02:50:03.334]  I've never done it.
[02:50:03.334 --> 02:50:04.494]  I should do it.
[02:50:04.494 --> 02:50:06.835]  And to spend the time to refocus.
[02:50:06.835 --> 02:50:14.017]  I think all the time about leaving for a week or two and getting a cabin somewhere by myself to fast and try to get myself refocused.
[02:50:14.777 --> 02:50:26.002]  Because this isn't such important work, and I think what you say is important, ma'am, but there's no need to call us 100 to 200 times a day here at the office.
[02:50:26.002 --> 02:50:29.683]  It's a full- I mean, seriously, we couldn't listen to all those messages even if we tried.
[02:50:29.683 --> 02:50:31.924]  And a lot of people email me and they say, why don't you screen your calls?
[02:50:31.924 --> 02:50:33.705]  We don't screen our calls.
[02:50:33.705 --> 02:50:38.887]  Because we have, you know, people that get in, but then regular callers get in most of the time instead of the millions that are trying to get in.
[02:50:38.887 --> 02:50:42.088]  Like, I'm going to jam in a few final calls in the final segment straight ahead, but
[02:50:46.325 --> 02:50:47.666]  I did overdrive for an hour yesterday.
[02:50:47.666 --> 02:50:49.948]  I don't think I'm going to do that today because we've got a lot of work we've got to get done.
[02:50:49.948 --> 02:50:53.051]  Boy, their chemtrailing is heavily here in Austin, Texas.
[02:50:53.051 --> 02:50:54.452]  It's just incredible.
[02:50:54.452 --> 02:50:57.255]  The program's even admitted, but the public can't admit it to themselves.
[02:50:57.255 --> 02:50:59.697]  I mean, the globalists are so far down the line.
[02:51:02.034 --> 02:51:06.138]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:06.138 --> 02:51:10.642]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.

[02:54:24.785 --> 02:54:26.326]  Joe in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding.
[02:54:26.326 --> 02:54:27.246]  Go ahead.
[02:54:27.246 --> 02:54:30.708]  Hey Alex, long time listener, supporter and so on.
[02:54:30.708 --> 02:54:34.409]  Three quick things I'd like to say and I'll take comments off air.
[02:54:34.409 --> 02:54:46.255]  I believe that this whole China thing is scriptural because in Revelation 9 it specifically talks about a 200 million man army.
[02:54:46.255 --> 02:54:50.396]  Now that was written thousands of years ago and China has a 200 man
[02:54:52.382 --> 02:54:57.567]  Or 200 million men surplus, that's my first point.
[02:54:57.567 --> 02:55:07.937]  Second thing on the TSA, I live in Pennsylvania, I can walk into any gun store I want to with my ID and in 10 minutes walk out with a rifle or handgun.
[02:55:07.937 --> 02:55:13.662]  And the third thing was the Chris Matthews issue, I was very upset about that.
[02:55:13.662 --> 02:55:16.024]  I called MSNBC and made my
[02:55:17.645 --> 02:55:21.927]  Concerns known and there's a number if we can do like a phone bomb maybe.
[02:55:21.927 --> 02:55:30.212]  Well that's fine but I mean they tell him to create racial enmity when he calls white people crackers and says if you don't like big government you secretly burn crosses.
[02:55:30.212 --> 02:55:34.114]  I mean that's his job but yeah we can give out the number for slimeball if you want.
[02:55:34.114 --> 02:55:35.435]  212-664-4444.
[02:55:35.435 --> 02:55:36.635]  Alright.
[02:55:36.635 --> 02:55:41.478]  Thank you very much.
[02:55:41.478 --> 02:55:42.098]  Thank you.
[02:55:42.098 --> 02:55:45.300]  I mean I don't know what comments I can make you just said it all right there.
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:46.861]  Jonathan in Kansas you're on the air.
[02:55:48.126 --> 02:55:53.856]  Yes, um, Alex, I just want to talk about a few things.
[02:55:54.652 --> 02:56:03.838]  Are you aware of the dioxin scare in Germany and how many farms were shut down and you see a lot of people who are running towards organic food?
[02:56:03.838 --> 02:56:08.662]  Yes, and here they just cover it up when you get dioxin and wonder why your kidneys fail at 30.
[02:56:08.662 --> 02:56:14.545]  But yeah, they've had to kill a bunch of the farm animals, pigs and others because there's just so much toxic garbage in the food chain.
[02:56:14.545 --> 02:56:18.108]  Germany and other countries will hardly even let Chinese food additives in.
[02:56:18.108 --> 02:56:19.849]  They make the bulk additives over here.
[02:56:19.849 --> 02:56:20.609]  They don't even check them.
[02:56:21.650 --> 02:56:26.814]  Makes many of our prescription and over-the-counter drugs and exports their toxic waste here.
[02:56:26.814 --> 02:56:29.817]  It's totally insane.
[02:56:29.817 --> 02:56:30.277]  Yeah.
[02:56:30.277 --> 02:56:34.061]  Also, I wanted to talk about some social engineering.
[02:56:34.061 --> 02:56:38.504]  And you said with, uh, what's her name?
[02:56:38.504 --> 02:56:39.885]  You had her a few weeks ago.
[02:56:39.885 --> 02:56:43.669]  He was talking about how infiltration of conservative groups.
[02:56:43.669 --> 02:56:44.569]  Charlottesville.
[02:56:44.569 --> 02:56:45.370]  Yeah.
[02:56:45.370 --> 02:56:45.911]  Yeah.
[02:56:45.911 --> 02:56:46.751]  Yeah.
[02:56:46.751 --> 02:56:49.794]  Well, you know how you talked about how, uh,
[02:56:50.461 --> 02:56:53.383]  Public schooling was created in Prussia.
[02:56:53.383 --> 02:56:59.826]  Well, not only that, many other social, like social welfare programs, for example.
[02:56:59.826 --> 02:57:19.678]  The first tested, what do you call it, social security was actually developed by the King of Prussia, and he said he thought it was a way to, like, counter, like, there used to be coal miners that had their own social security, and people would put money into this pot, and people would never get hurt.
[02:57:20.307 --> 02:57:21.889]  We're good.
[02:57:31.903 --> 02:57:32.403]  Yeah, and also
[02:57:56.690 --> 02:57:58.051]  I want to ask you a question.
[02:57:58.051 --> 02:58:06.696]  Is Daniel Bell, the guy who created the book Post-Industrial Society, is he a high-level globalist, like a mouthpiece?
[02:58:06.696 --> 02:58:13.580]  Because he talked about how social welfare programs was gonna, he said heavy industry was gonna leave the West.
[02:58:14.395 --> 02:58:25.525]  Yeah, well you've got the UN, you've got the head of the Goddard Space Center, you've got them all saying we're going to artificially get rid of industry, we're going to make you communalize farms under corporate control so you can never rebel.
[02:58:25.525 --> 02:58:27.867]  It's called domestication.
[02:58:27.867 --> 02:58:37.836]  You know, just like they breed animals to be subservient, they're artificially creating a society where you've got a bunch of dumbed down, childlike adults who are a bunch of people who submit to tyranny.
[02:58:37.836 --> 02:58:39.258]  I'll see you back live tomorrow.
[02:58:39.258 --> 02:58:40.138]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:58:41.661 --> 02:58:45.244]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[02:58:45.244 --> 02:58:47.987]  Don't forget that Google Mom, folks!
[02:58:52.122 --> 02:58:55.705]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:55.705 --> 02:58:57.007]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:57.007 --> 02:59:01.411]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:59:01.411 --> 02:59:07.356]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:07.356 --> 02:59:09.498]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:09.498 --> 02:59:12.181]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:12.521 --> 02:59:19.024]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.

[02:59:21.225 --> 02:59:26.567]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:59:26.567 --> 02:59:31.849]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
