[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:06.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:08.291]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.072]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:11.812]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.412]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:14.953]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:19.154]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:23.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:40.935]  Well, he is certainly an icon of TV, movies, politics, a true dark horse, maverick, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, host of the hit TV show on TruTV, Conspiracy Theory, going into its third season.
[00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.938]  Number one New York Times bestseller over and over again.
[00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:48.700]  His latest book, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.902]  He's got a new book coming out soon as well, The Prolific.
[00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:58.866]  Jesse Ventura joins us for the next hour and he told me some pretty hardcore stuff yesterday but said I couldn't talk about it.
[00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.948]  Today he said I might want to talk about it.
[00:01:01.488 --> 00:01:02.969]  He'll make the decision.
[00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.190]  We'll talk about it later in the hour if he wants to.
[00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.631]  Governor, good to have you here with us.
[00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.371]  Great, Alex.
[00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:08.992]  Always a pleasure to be here.
[00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:16.576]  It's ugly, rainy weather today up in Minnesota, so that's why I agreed to do an hour with you, because I can't play golf.
[00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.798]  Golf is the only thing that'll stop me from doing you, Alex.
[00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:22.059]  I know.
[00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:23.139]  You're very, very nice, sir.
[00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:27.902]  Before we get into all the serious issues, your wife, Terri, is so great.
[00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.223]  It was great seeing her out at your birthday party in Los Angeles.
[00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.433]  Yesterday I call up and I go, yeah, Jessie said call Monday to get him on this week.
[00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:38.035]  She said, oh great, well, he's on the elliptic and the dog's on the treadmill.
[00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:39.516]  They watch sports together.
[00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.957]  And I said, my God, that'd be the ultimate sports center video.
[00:01:41.957 --> 00:01:43.678]  And she goes, no, no, no, no.
[00:01:43.678 --> 00:01:44.338]  He get mad at me.
[00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.899]  And I said, no, I'm just joking.
[00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.522]  But you got to tell us about your dog and about the treadmill action.
[00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:55.423]  Well, I always like to keep myself in shape.
[00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:56.404]  I try to do that.
[00:01:56.404 --> 00:02:04.066]  I think it's even more important as you get older to continue to train and keep you physically in shape as much as you can.
[00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:09.267]  So I try to work out light with weights in the morning and then I do the Olympic machine after.
[00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:12.908]  Right now I do six miles at a pop on it, which is pretty good.
[00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:23.911]  You know, my dog, when I first started training, he loves to participate in anything that I do and wants to be around me or my wife constantly.
[00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.988]  He immediately looked like, what do I do during all this?
[00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:31.730]  And he got up on the treadmill and we turned it on with no training at all.
[00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.733]  And he now runs on the treadmill while I do the elliptic machine.
[00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:37.674]  And of course, I got a TV screen in there.
[00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:40.436]  And if The Young and the Restless is on, we watch that.
[00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:43.918]  If it's before that, we watch The Price is Right or we watch SportsCenter.
[00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.905]  Yeah, he trains with me every morning and it's kind of nice to be able to do that.
[00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:54.750]  And even when the weather gets bad here in Minnesota, that's what's good about it.
[00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.031]  We can train indoors.
[00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:57.853]  So, it's a good thing.
[00:02:57.853 --> 00:03:00.276]  And, you know, dogs will adapt to treadmills.
[00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:03.460]  I don't think, though, if they are allowed to be introduced to them.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.344]  In a good manner and not get frightened of them in any way, shape, or form.
[00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:18.092]  A dog will run on a treadmill and it's a great way to keep them in shape and like on days like today in Minnesota when it's raining out all day, saves you from having to go outside.
[00:03:18.092 --> 00:03:20.794]  Well, especially a prized German Shepherd now.
[00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:29.040]  Now, he has a public name and then he has his real name, but this is a well-trained German Shepherd, really smart.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.063]  Oh yeah, well actually he's not a German Shepherd, he's a Belgian Malinois.
[00:03:32.543 --> 00:03:34.445]  Okay, it looks like a German Shepherd to me.
[00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:35.305]  I'm ignorant.
[00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:36.526]  Well, no, you're not ignorant.
[00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:43.833]  They look very much alike because years and years ago, the German Shepherd, I believe, came out of the Belgian Malinois.
[00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.894]  He is just called a Belgian Shepherd.
[00:03:45.894 --> 00:03:50.378]  You have a German Shepherd and a Belgian Shepherd, and they're slightly different.
[00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:56.783]  The Belgian's a little bit smaller, doesn't get the hip displacement problems because your German Shepherds are big.
[00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:57.864]  They get 90 to 110 pounds or more.
[00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:06.569]  Yeah, any dog that gets that big is going to have the problem of the hip displacement stuff or run the risk of it.
[00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:22.876]  Not saying they all will, but they run a greater risk where the Belgian Shepherd is about 75, between 70 and 80 pounds and that 20 pounds difference can make all the difference apparently between the hip trouble, you know, and then of course a lot of it could be hereditary too.
[00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:25.518]  Is Dexter looking up at you right now, Governor?
[00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:26.438]  No, he's upstairs sleeping.
[00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:32.019]  I usually put him on there for about a half hour to 45 minutes.
[00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:35.600]  You know, I don't keep track of the miles.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.801]  I just set it at a particular pace and let him go for 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.042]  It gives him good exercise.
[00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:49.826]  Incredible.
[00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:50.406]  Wow.
[00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:51.567]  Alright, Governor, stay there.
[00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.709]  We're coming back to the full audience.
[00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:55.571]  We're going to get into a host of issues.
[00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:59.074]  Election 2012, the TSA, and more with Jesse Ventura.
[00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:09.248]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:10.168]  Number one.
[00:05:10.168 --> 00:05:13.591]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.452]  Number two.
[00:05:14.452 --> 00:05:19.335]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:20.076]  It's true.
[00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:24.960]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.780]  Number three.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.363]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:33.066]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.067]  Number 4.
[00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.829]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:40.512]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:40.512 --> 00:05:41.293]  Number 5.
[00:05:41.293 --> 00:05:45.437]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:45.437 --> 00:05:50.201]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:54.664]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:56.446]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:58.687]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:58.687 --> 00:06:01.049]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:21.608]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:21.608 --> 00:06:24.069]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.771]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:35.995]  In the time we have left for the rest of this hour, we'll get into the upcoming TV show with Sean Stone, who looks just like Oliver Stone, a really smart guy.
[00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:44.559]  Of course, another great director and his own right, researcher Tyrell Ventura, another chip off the old block.
[00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.280]  So certainly the next generation of
[00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:47.703]  I don't know.
[00:07:08.464 --> 00:07:13.989]  And of course, his last book, American Conspiracies, long before this one, with Dick Russell, is also excellent.
[00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:19.273]  Before he leaves us, we'll talk about some of the new books that are scheduled to be coming out as well.
[00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:27.780]  But Jesse, finishing up before we get into TSA, before we get into all these other subjects.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.343]  During the break, you were saying something a little more.
[00:07:31.343 --> 00:07:37.047]  A light bulb was going off from your underwater demolition Navy SEAL days about the 22
[00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:45.534]  Well, the light bulb was, again, like we talked about, Alex, standard operating procedures.
[00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:55.263]  And generally, a standard operating procedure, to the best of my knowledge in the SEALs, is it's one platoon per hero.
[00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:57.845]  And a platoon is twelve enlisted and two officers.
[00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:05.993]  So clearly, if that's true, there was a violation of standard operating procedure right there.
[00:08:05.993 --> 00:08:10.354]  There were too many SEALs on board one specific helicopter.
[00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:14.035]  Normally, they would have divided that into two to three HELOs.
[00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.656]  That is exactly what the father said his son, the Navy SEAL, said.
[00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:19.616]  And again, I know the family.
[00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:20.816]  Sure.
[00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:28.918]  Well, then things haven't changed that much because I've been out for 40 years, you know, but it's still pretty much the same rules would apply, I would imagine.
[00:08:30.233 --> 00:08:38.458]  Well, it's just incredible that the entire SOP was different and then it just so happens to be SEAL Team 6.
[00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:40.980]  Again, the biggest one-day loss in troops.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.322]  Well, and I'll tell you the sad part about it being SEAL Team 6.
[00:08:44.322 --> 00:08:47.524]  These are all career men.
[00:08:47.524 --> 00:08:54.028]  You're not going to find a guy on SEAL Team 6 that's wet behind the ears and just left high school or college a year ago.
[00:08:54.921 --> 00:09:06.350]  These are all combat-season veterans, probably with two to three to four tours to Iraq and Afghanistan on regular SEAL teams.
[00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:13.496]  And so SEAL Team 6 are guys that have been specially selected to do that type of work.
[00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:19.441]  Not that all the SEALs could potentially be qualified for SEAL Team 6, certainly.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:28.684]  But 6 is basically made up of... You're not going to find many 22 year olds, I don't believe, in Team 6.
[00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:33.746]  Most of the guys are going to be between probably 27, 32 years old.
[00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:36.568]  And they've survived a lot of deadly missions.
[00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:41.381]  Only to be blown out of the sky to keep something secret.
[00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.722]  I mean, it's come out now that the Bin Laden thing.
[00:09:43.722 --> 00:09:45.683]  They had a fake Situation Room photo.
[00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:48.645]  They lied and said Obama was watching it.
[00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:50.506]  They lied and said they had live feeds.
[00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:51.086]  They lied.
[00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:52.467]  Threw him in the water.
[00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:59.871]  Let's take it all the way back and let's take the lies to where they go back to and that's George Bush and these whole wars to begin with.
[00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:01.172]  Yes.
[00:10:01.172 --> 00:10:04.014]  You know, let's not let him off the hook either.
[00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:08.760]  Because he's the one that put us in these wars.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.421]  He's the one.
[00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.982]  9-11 happened on his watch.
[00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:17.085]  And so to me, it goes back to Cheney, Bush, Rove, and that whole cast of characters even more.
[00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:19.431]  Certainly!
[00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:26.134]  Look, I don't... I've exposed them, but at the end of the day, Barack Obama's saying, I don't need Congress to launch an attack in Libya.
[00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:27.134]  Well, I agree!
[00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:28.355]  You know, don't get me wrong.
[00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:37.758]  You know I'm an equal despiser of both the Democrats and Republicans, but I like to keep people focused on that they shouldn't have just one or two year memories.
[00:10:37.758 --> 00:10:40.219]  That these memories need to go back at least a decade.
[00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:42.040]  No, I agree with you.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:50.585]  Shifting gears into another area, when I was talking to you the other day, you said, Alex, I'm like a honey badger, I just don't care anymore.
[00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:58.929]  Well, you know, I'll tell you, Alex, my patriotism to this government is literally shredded.
[00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:01.730]  I don't have any anymore.
[00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.431]  To the government.
[00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:10.238]  To the government that runs this country, I have no more patriotism for them, and it's a sad thing to hear myself say that.
[00:11:10.238 --> 00:11:12.080]  Well, it's been taken over.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.964]  But I have no loyalty to this government of the United States anymore.
[00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:21.567]  Because, now, to the people of this country, that's different.
[00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:24.429]  To the country, it's like my t-shirt that I sell now, Alex.
[00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:28.793]  You get it on my website, it says, I love my country, not my government.
[00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:32.206]  And it's got Jesse Ventura written right on it.
[00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:34.168]  I proudly wear that shirt.
[00:11:34.168 --> 00:11:38.072]  I love my country, not my government.
[00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:41.756]  And the government is made up of Democrats and Republicans.
[00:11:41.756 --> 00:11:42.056]  Both.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.684]  Well, Gov, let's get into the TSA before we get into 2012 right now.
[00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:59.330]  You said that you're going to make a big announcement if the judge throws out your case without even letting it go to trial.
[00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.031]  I talked to you last week.
[00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:06.975]  You said that you were happy to talk, but it's just your lawyer and your opinion, but that it looks like
[00:12:07.515 --> 00:12:16.705]  The fact that she has waited so long that your lawyer thinks that might actually lean towards the fact that she's getting it ready to make sure that it does go to trial.
[00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:18.768]  Well, we don't know.
[00:12:18.768 --> 00:12:21.070]  There's no way to judge Alex.
[00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.013]  When it comes to federal judges...
[00:12:23.773 --> 00:12:25.715]  Um, throw everything out the window.
[00:12:25.715 --> 00:12:26.876]  They're all different.
[00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:34.221]  You can't... You know, you have thoughts that, well, they're taping a long time, so obviously she's studying the case real well.
[00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:38.945]  Well, you'd like to believe that, but it might just be maybe she went on vacation and hasn't got to it.
[00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:39.946]  I don't know.
[00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:43.588]  With federal judges, you have no idea.
[00:12:43.588 --> 00:12:45.150]  All I can state is this.
[00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:49.653]  Any case like this has been ruled upon faster than this one.
[00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:52.035]  This is the longest any judge has held on.
[00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:56.630]  To a case right now, I can state that unequivocally.
[00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.173]  Because it's been over two months.
[00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:03.779]  I went into court, I believe it was July 22nd or 21st, something like that.
[00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:06.142]  It was a couple days after my birthday.
[00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:12.832]  That's why I had to get back to Minnesota from L.A., which I had to drive, of course, because I can't fly.
[00:13:12.832 --> 00:13:18.994]  And so I drove back to Minnesota and got back the night before I had to go into court.
[00:13:18.994 --> 00:13:23.196]  And so we went into court, it was like July 21st or something like that.
[00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:30.579]  Well, here we are already past September 21st, but there's no ruling yet, so it's been well over 60 days.
[00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:34.121]  Generally, rulings always happen within 90.
[00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:35.922]  I'd like to believe mine will also.
[00:13:36.904 --> 00:13:38.585]  And when she rules, we'll know.
[00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:43.808]  But you can't read anything into anything with the federal judge, Alex, because they're all different.
[00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:46.609]  But I just think that she hasn't thrown it out.
[00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:48.811]  That's the good thing.
[00:13:48.811 --> 00:14:00.857]  Now, you're saying you're going to make a big announcement if they... If it's thrown out, I will definitely call a press conference.
[00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:01.858]  Absolutely.
[00:14:01.858 --> 00:14:05.440]  If my case is thrown, if they will not let me go in front of a jury,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:28.469]  Well, I think that's important to do, and then also you said you'd pop in here after the press conference, but I hope the case goes forward because if it doesn't, this country is in deep trouble.
[00:14:28.988 --> 00:14:30.250]  I would think so too.
[00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:36.340]  I mean, you know, although I have to tell you there was a vicious letter to the editor up here in the St.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.168]  Paul paper criticizing me for tangling up our court system with such a frivolous
[00:14:42.608 --> 00:14:45.830]  Well, Jesse, there's a reason nobody reads those rags anymore.
[00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.352]  They had a USA Today poll last week.
[00:14:49.352 --> 00:14:59.558]  85% are against what the TSA is doing and don't want the NFL, under homeland security pressure, to start having private security grab your wife's breasts, your genitals.
[00:14:59.558 --> 00:15:02.920]  They say everything will be groped from the ankles up.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.141]  What's your view of that, Governor?
[00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:05.362]  It's already happening.
[00:15:06.175 --> 00:15:08.619]  It's already happening, Alex.
[00:15:08.619 --> 00:15:11.523]  I'm a season ticket holder with the Minnesota Lynx.
[00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:13.585]  You know, the women's basketball team?
[00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:14.407]  Yes.
[00:15:14.407 --> 00:15:20.155]  And two times in the last two games I've gone down there, they've stopped me to run me.
[00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:28.091]  And the first one, the guy stopped me because I had my wallet and my keys in my front pocket.
[00:15:28.091 --> 00:15:31.774]  And he stopped me and said, excuse me, what's in your front pocket?
[00:15:31.774 --> 00:15:36.879]  And I looked at the kid and I said, I'm the damn governor.
[00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:41.904]  I said, don't make me have to sue you like I'm suing TSA.
[00:15:41.904 --> 00:15:44.466]  I said, what difference does it make?
[00:15:44.466 --> 00:15:46.068]  I used to be the governor here.
[00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:49.520]  You know, here's some common sense, young man.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.740]  And I chewed his ass out.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.461]  I showed him my... I said, it's my wallet, my car keys.
[00:15:54.461 --> 00:16:05.803]  And then I got it again the last game.
[00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:09.104]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck with an urgent update from eFoods Direct.
[00:16:13.268 --> 00:16:21.932]  Eats Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.

[00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:30.895]  But you have to understand, we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:37.778]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[00:16:38.158 --> 00:16:41.239]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:46.400]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline September 30th.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.421]  Free shipping including Alaska and Hawaii ends September 30th.

[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.561]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:13.866]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.407]  Saving means to make money.
[00:17:15.407 --> 00:17:24.195]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:17:24.935 --> 00:17:32.461]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:17:32.461 --> 00:17:40.467]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:47.873]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:10.878]  Tyranny is here.
[00:18:10.878 --> 00:18:14.421]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:17.203]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:18:17.203 --> 00:18:22.907]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:18:22.907 --> 00:18:29.572]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:35.537]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:18:35.537 --> 00:18:39.240]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.001]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:18:44.001 --> 00:18:49.963]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:53.505]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:55.485]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:56.626]  It's here.

[00:19:12.392 --> 00:19:17.533]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:19:17.533 --> 00:19:26.255]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:19:26.255 --> 00:19:30.315]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:19:30.315 --> 00:19:32.476]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:19:44.403 --> 00:19:46.564]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:19:46.564 --> 00:19:48.345]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.131]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:02.931]  Got it.
[00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:03.432]  Others don't.
[00:20:06.693 --> 00:20:10.299]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:13.504]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:24.992]  The Libertarians have ballot access in all 50 states.
[00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:28.473]  Ron Paul could be the Libertarians' candidate for president.
[00:20:28.473 --> 00:20:31.914]  That's what needs to happen.
[00:20:31.914 --> 00:20:35.935]  You know, let's elect a president that isn't a Democrat or Republican.
[00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:41.257]  Then, Ron Paul takes me as his running mate.
[00:20:41.257 --> 00:20:41.837]  Why?
[00:20:41.837 --> 00:20:45.238]  Because I'm the best insurance policy he could ever have.
[00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:52.726]  There ain't nobody gonna kill Ron Paul and let Jesse Ventura in there.
[00:20:52.726 --> 00:20:54.367]  That's a good point when you made that.
[00:20:54.367 --> 00:21:00.671]  Well, Jesse, listen, you know, I talked to Ron Paul privately the last time he ran and this time and he said, I don't know if I'm gonna run, Alex.
[00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:11.518]  And I said, look, you're as smart as I am or smarter, Congressman, you're gonna win by injecting real issues, anti-war, all the rest of this stuff, pro-Constitution, you gotta run.
[00:21:11.518 --> 00:21:14.920]  He said, no, you, that's, and he said, no, that's a good point, I probably am.
[00:21:16.295 --> 00:21:26.322]  I am telling Ron Paul, here on air, and I'm saying it to Ron Paul listeners and supporters, to let him know this.
[00:21:26.322 --> 00:21:28.263]  And I know it's already been run past him.
[00:21:28.263 --> 00:21:34.267]  He has said he'll only run using the Republican machine ring because he has a real shot at winning.
[00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:36.508]  But if he doesn't win the Republican primary,
[00:21:37.711 --> 00:21:41.775]  If he runs as a libertarian candidate, he will get the nomination.
[00:21:41.775 --> 00:21:42.976]  He'll get a strong showing.
[00:21:42.976 --> 00:21:49.181]  He could get double digits and be in the poll position like Ross Perot was before Bush threatened him and he dropped out.
[00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:55.166]  And Ron Paul does have a chance to win and you could join the ticket or you could be part of the cabinet if he offered it.
[00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.127]  But regardless,
[00:21:56.727 --> 00:22:03.712]  Then he'd be in the main, main election, challenging Obama and Mitt Romney or whoever else is there.
[00:22:03.712 --> 00:22:04.953]  I'm drafting Ron Paul.
[00:22:04.953 --> 00:22:08.136]  He must run as a Libertarian if he loses the Republican primary.
[00:22:08.136 --> 00:22:08.616]  I agree.
[00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:11.058]  I agree wholeheartedly with that.
[00:22:11.058 --> 00:22:16.942]  And I'm telling you, if Ron Paul took me as a running mate, we wouldn't just do well, Alex.
[00:22:16.942 --> 00:22:19.484]  We could win.
[00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:20.105]  I know, people love you.
[00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:25.649]  People love that right from me because I never enter races with the thought of just doing well.
[00:22:26.664 --> 00:22:30.866]  Jesse Ventura doesn't do things just to do them well.
[00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:34.288]  Jesse Ventura does things to win.
[00:22:34.288 --> 00:22:35.768]  To be the best.
[00:22:35.768 --> 00:22:40.951]  I didn't join the underwater demolition SEAL team, the most elite unit in the U.S.
[00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:43.072]  military, just to do something well.
[00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:44.153]  No, I understand.
[00:22:44.153 --> 00:22:47.454]  I did it because I'd like being the best.
[00:22:47.454 --> 00:22:49.155]  Ron Paul can win.
[00:22:49.155 --> 00:22:50.436]  It's out there.
[00:22:50.436 --> 00:22:55.258]  All you've got to do is activate and get the silent voters out to vote.
[00:22:56.977 --> 00:23:01.600]  Yeah, that 30, 40, 50% that calls themselves independent sitting out there.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.762]  The 50% that don't vote.
[00:23:04.762 --> 00:23:05.362]  Yes.
[00:23:05.362 --> 00:23:09.145]  You have to give them a reason to see their vote work.
[00:23:09.145 --> 00:23:10.986]  It would create incredible excitement.
[00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:15.849]  It would create unbelievable excitement if Ron Paul and I ran as the Libertarian ticket.
[00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:19.030]  Well, Ron Paul's a great guy.
[00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.251]  He's got a lot of great people around him.
[00:23:20.251 --> 00:23:25.775]  He also has some mainline kind of Republican people.
[00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:27.757]  So you're reaching out to Ron Paul right now?
[00:23:28.305 --> 00:23:33.950]  No, I'm just saying that I would be his best choice because I'd be a great insurance policy, Alex.
[00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.331]  Yes, sir.
[00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:39.556]  They're not going to do anything to him, and that would put me in charge?
[00:23:39.556 --> 00:23:47.564]  They're far better off with Ron Paul than they are Jesse Ventura as far as somebody who, you know, would cause them major problems.
[00:23:48.305 --> 00:23:51.166]  Well, just incredible information, Gov.
[00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:53.047]  But I want to be clear where I stand from.
[00:23:53.047 --> 00:23:56.809]  I don't do this radio show because I think we'll do well.
[00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:58.029]  I know we're going to beat tyranny.
[00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:59.190]  We don't have a choice.
[00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:13.476]  I was just being clear that by competing, by being involved, by going all the way and staying in the election all the way through, even as an independent, you win just by being involved and injecting real ideas.
[00:24:13.476 --> 00:24:16.597]  You know, to use a sports analogy, you go to the playoffs.
[00:24:16.937 --> 00:24:19.539]  Sure, he can win the Super Bowl as well.
[00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:20.619]  Obviously, play to win.
[00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:22.841]  I'm just saying, you win by competing.
[00:24:22.841 --> 00:24:24.341]  You never win if you don't... Absolutely.
[00:24:24.341 --> 00:24:29.965]  And maybe what you do, Alex, if you don't win this time, you lay the groundwork for the next guy to win.
[00:24:29.965 --> 00:24:30.905]  Exactly.
[00:24:30.905 --> 00:24:32.426]  No, no, I understand that.
[00:24:32.426 --> 00:24:34.687]  It's a process that takes a while.
[00:24:34.687 --> 00:24:40.571]  I could never have been governor of Minnesota without the runs that Dean Barkley did before me.
[00:24:42.037 --> 00:24:47.642]  Because Dean Barclay was the man that got my party major party status in the state of Minnesota.
[00:24:47.642 --> 00:24:48.162]  Yes.
[00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:52.886]  And it took Dean Barclay to do that first before I ever would have had.
[00:24:52.886 --> 00:25:02.234]  If Dean hadn't have done that, there's no way that I would have won governor because I wouldn't have had major party status and I wouldn't have been included in the debate.
[00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:03.275]  Exactly.
[00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:07.339]  There are trailblazers that come before us and then each of us is a trailblazer for the next.
[00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:11.502]  Well, I did hear a little bird that that may be why
[00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:29.697]  In fact, there's no maybe about it.
[00:25:29.697 --> 00:25:30.397]  He is probably.
[00:25:30.397 --> 00:25:31.698]  I'm not going to say anything.
[00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.458]  Ron Paul is looking at what you're saying.
[00:25:33.458 --> 00:25:34.259]  I know that.
[00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:34.639]  Okay?
[00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:35.659]  Well, I hope so.
[00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:36.540]  I really hope so.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:47.465]  Because Ron has the power, and I think the two of us, and I guarantee you that as I walk around today, you can't believe all the people that come up to me and ask me to run for president.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:56.029]  Well, I want to talk more about that, but let me just tell you, Ron Paul's announced he's not running again for the House, so he'll be out in a year regardless.
[00:25:56.029 --> 00:26:09.044]  And the word is, he is positioning to say, when he quits the Republican Party, that, hey, I'm serving out my term, I'm done, I'm leaving the party, and that he'd have to do that because he probably couldn't win that House seat later without the Republican engine.
[00:26:09.304 --> 00:26:09.504]  I don't
[00:26:32.928 --> 00:26:37.471]  And Dennis Kucinich is a great guy, but he's not as libertarian as you guys are.
[00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:40.352]  And he said he might put Kucinich in his cabinet.
[00:26:40.352 --> 00:26:43.754]  Would you look at being in a Ron Paul cabinet if he won?
[00:26:43.754 --> 00:26:44.535]  I don't know.
[00:26:44.535 --> 00:26:50.878]  You know, it would depend on could I leave the Baja.
[00:26:50.878 --> 00:26:57.962]  In fact, Alex, if I was his VP guy, could we move the VP down to the Baja?
[00:26:57.962 --> 00:27:01.204]  No, because, I mean, the President and VP can't be together anyway.
[00:27:03.186 --> 00:27:04.209]  No, exactly.
[00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:05.834]  So, I'll go down to the Baja, then.
[00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:09.746]  As long as I can keep having my Baja winters of surfing, we got no problem.
[00:27:10.387 --> 00:27:18.853]  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of presidents want their, like George Washington had John Adams, they want their vice president to stay out of it.
[00:27:18.853 --> 00:27:19.834]  Well, and I would.
[00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.235]  I'd be happy to stay out of it.
[00:27:21.235 --> 00:27:25.017]  You know, I'd just be there waiting in the wings to make sure nothing would happen to him.
[00:27:25.017 --> 00:27:28.520]  Okay, so officially you're saying you would take a VP spot with Ron Paul?
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.781]  I would give it very serious consideration.
[00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:34.544]  I can't tell you right now I would because my wife is not sitting next to me.
[00:27:36.244 --> 00:27:41.870]  No, anything I would do of that nature, I would require to have to talk to her first.
[00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:47.697]  Because we've been married 36 years now, and I don't do much of anything without consulting her.
[00:27:47.697 --> 00:27:49.919]  Sure, sure.
[00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:53.844]  But if your better half said green light, then you're go.
[00:27:53.844 --> 00:27:56.287]  There'd be a damn good chance of it.
[00:27:56.807 --> 00:27:59.531]  Well, Dick and I are working on another book today.
[00:28:12.867 --> 00:28:19.150]  Hopefully you'll be out right before the elections because it'll be a timely book dealing with the elections.
[00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:23.371]  And the TV show, we're in the middle of production as I said right now.
[00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:32.715]  Unfortunately we had this tragedy happen a couple days ago which we're looking into of course and we will probably cover it with the TV show because it was part of it.
[00:28:34.356 --> 00:28:35.216]  We're good to go.
[00:29:03.816 --> 00:29:05.904]  Very exciting Governor, we're out of time.
[00:29:05.904 --> 00:29:08.253]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck with an urgent update.
[00:29:13.507 --> 00:29:13.987]  We're good to go.
[00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:41.378]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.

[00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:11.733]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:18.175]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:31:18.175 --> 00:31:20.436]  Number one, study the past.
[00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.837]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:31:22.837 --> 00:31:26.559]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:30.781]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:31:30.781 --> 00:31:34.624]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:31:34.624 --> 00:31:39.668]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:31:39.668 --> 00:31:43.670]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:47.093]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:31:47.093 --> 00:31:50.735]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:56.499]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[00:32:01.122 --> 00:32:03.824]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:08.187]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:08.187 --> 00:32:13.493]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:13.493 --> 00:32:15.035]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:23.805]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:32.068]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:32.068 --> 00:32:40.090]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:47.472]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:33:06.802 --> 00:33:08.323]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:08.323 --> 00:33:10.385]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:10.385 --> 00:33:13.586]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:17.056 --> 00:33:29.686]  I wanted to talk to Dr. Sherry Tinpenny because she's probably the most respected and well-known medical doctor out there breaking down exactly what's happening with these vaccines that are being pushed on us.
[00:33:29.686 --> 00:33:38.733]  And she was absolutely accurate when it came to breaking down the carnage that was going to be caused by the H1N1 shot for the flu back in 2009.
[00:33:38.733 --> 00:33:42.395]  Doc, it's great to have you here with us tonight.
[00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:43.436]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:33:43.436 --> 00:33:44.197]  Thanks for asking me.
[00:33:44.764 --> 00:33:46.887]  Where do you want to start first?
[00:33:46.887 --> 00:33:49.650]  The new contaminants in the Gardasil?
[00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.614]  The move for forced inoculations without parental consent?
[00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:58.481]  Or the fact that in 2009, in hindsight, we learned that you were absolutely on target with what that was going to do?
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.601]  Well, it's all in the news, isn't it?
[00:34:01.601 --> 00:34:05.723]  And it's one thing after another these days, because what you said was exactly right.
[00:34:05.723 --> 00:34:22.691]  There are millions and millions of people that are now waking up and looking around, and every single time one of these events happen, whether it was bird flu in 2005, whether it was swine flu in 2009, and then the H1N1, all the difficulties that we had when we saw the H1N1 given to young children and also to pregnant women.
[00:34:23.872 --> 00:34:38.589]  And now we've got this whole thing with Gardasil and showing that we've got a biohazard contaminant that's been documented from samples that have been tested from five countries and several different states and the FDA says that this recombinant HPV which has been bound
[00:34:38.729 --> 00:34:39.029]  I don't know.
[00:35:04.244 --> 00:35:14.927]  Well, if you read the package inserts for H1N1, regular flu shot and others, it says neurological disorders, cancer, brain damage, convulsions.
[00:35:14.927 --> 00:35:26.189]  But then you turn on the news and they've got vaccine company spokespeople not telling you that they work for them or on their payroll, saying no one's ever been hurt by a vaccine.
[00:35:26.189 --> 00:35:29.430]  Are we seeing more and more desperate lying because they're scared?
[00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:44.503]  I believe that's true, and every time I hear Dr. Nancy Snyderman on the news talking about how safe and effective vaccines are, trying to assure all of the scared little parents out there, what she's been saying has been absolutely false.
[00:35:44.503 --> 00:35:46.546]  She's actually been giving bad and wrong information.
[00:35:47.046 --> 00:35:59.029]  Instead of promoting the Gardasil vaccine for young girls, because now we're trying to give it to young girls and boys starting at nine years of age, the clinical trials were actually done on 16 to 24 year olds, not on little girls.
[00:35:59.029 --> 00:36:01.469]  We have no idea how long this is going to last.
[00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:06.191]  We know there's a hundred different HPV strains, 15 of which have been associated with cancer.
[00:36:06.191 --> 00:36:07.651]  The vaccine only covers two.
[00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:15.755]  And we have no idea of whether this vaccine is going to have any impact on cervical cancer at all when these girls get to be 30 to 40 years of age.
[00:36:15.755 --> 00:36:23.879]  What she should be, what Dr. Nancy Snyderman should be promoting, is that young girls need to be getting regular pap smears.
[00:36:23.879 --> 00:36:30.763]  And that that has been shown forever to be the most effective way and the most cost-effective way of preventing cervical cancer for the long run.
[00:36:31.443 --> 00:36:45.788]  Well, without getting too graphic, I'm no doctor, but I went and read the insert when the Gardasil first came out, and it said there on the insert, this is not even proven to actually protect you from the cancer.
[00:36:46.648 --> 00:37:05.072]  And then even in the trials we saw the autoimmune problems, the convulsions, the bleeding, people becoming paralyzed, and then lo and behold now there's scientists just in the news a few days ago were saying this DNA, the virus more whole than we first thought, bound to the aluminum
[00:37:05.732 --> 00:37:11.454]  This is the exact type of thing that would cause an autoimmune disease like lupus.
[00:37:11.454 --> 00:37:15.635]  And I heard you hinting at the fact that it had been actively bound.
[00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:21.517]  I know they looked at multiple sub-manufacturers of this Gardasil and found this had accidentally happened.
[00:37:21.517 --> 00:37:22.537]  Just like the U.N.
[00:37:22.537 --> 00:37:28.619]  accidentally, with a tetanus shot, had female hormone bound to it to cause miscarriages in women.
[00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:33.340]  Doc, you think this is being done on purpose and this vaccine could have some other use in it than we're being told?
[00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:34.783]  Well, certainly.
[00:37:34.783 --> 00:37:42.172]  I mean, it certainly could, Alex, because one of the other ingredients in the Gardasil vaccine is polysorbate 80.
[00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:51.103]  Polysorbate 80 is a preservative that they use in things like ice cream as a stabilizer, and it has been shown to cause infertility in female mice.
[00:37:51.564 --> 00:37:55.068]  And it causes testicular atrophy in male mice.
[00:37:55.068 --> 00:37:57.911]  And this is in the medical literature.
[00:37:57.911 --> 00:37:59.532]  People aren't making this up.
[00:37:59.532 --> 00:38:05.559]  And they also know that repeated doses of polysorbate 80 can lead to anaphylactic shock.
[00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:13.267]  Polysorbate 80 is also in the DTP vaccine, the DTaP, which they are now pushing on pregnant women for them to get the DTaP vaccine.
[00:38:13.607 --> 00:38:14.687]  So it's endless.
[00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:18.649]  I want to go back and address what you said about are they pushing back very strongly.
[00:38:18.649 --> 00:38:19.749]  Of course they are.
[00:38:19.749 --> 00:38:28.852]  Because you cannot make a living, you cannot make an $800 billion a year industry on the backs of unvaccinated healthy children.
[00:38:29.532 --> 00:38:32.596]  Most children who are unvaccinated are rarely sick.
[00:38:32.596 --> 00:38:36.902]  They may get the occasional cold or flu or a little bit of a fever, but it comes and goes.
[00:38:36.902 --> 00:38:39.825]  And so they are not chronically lifetime ill.
[00:38:39.825 --> 00:38:42.208]  Well, it's like the Amish.
[00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:45.553]  The epidemic of autism is unknown in their population.
[00:38:46.633 --> 00:38:49.714]  That's correct, and in many other populations.
[00:38:49.714 --> 00:39:03.617]  I mean, what we've been pushing for, you and I and all of us who are big vaccine advocates, what we've been pushing for for decades, now more than a decade, is for the CDC to finally do the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated study.
[00:39:03.617 --> 00:39:09.239]  It seems as though at some point we're going to have to just raise the money and do it ourselves because the CDC doesn't want to know the answer.
[00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:15.340]  They don't want to see a whole bunch of unvaccinated kids who never miss school, are on no chronic daily medications,
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.423]  Who are doing extraordinarily well, never get sick.
[00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:26.272]  They do not want to stand that up against a bunch of vaccinated kids who are on a whole bunch of medications that have a lifetime worth of injuries.
[00:39:26.272 --> 00:39:33.440]  Well, doctor, what you pointed out back in 2009, out of the gates, you said, look, from previous studies,
[00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:42.603]  We know that when you take this H1N1 flu shot or one that's similar, it's going to reduce your regular immunity to regular flu.
[00:39:42.603 --> 00:39:52.865]  And then they had the big Canadian mainline study that showed, what was it, a doubling in your chances of getting regular seasonal flu if you took the H1N1.
[00:39:52.865 --> 00:39:58.146]  Well, then I remember it was you and others that discovered that they were admitting that
[00:39:59.286 --> 00:40:09.734]  They might have had a plan previously to put simulants in the previous year's vaccine, and there's a lot of evidence they were actually triggering this H1N1 program.
[00:40:09.734 --> 00:40:11.555]  Can you speak to that?
[00:40:11.555 --> 00:40:12.616]  Yeah, I can, Alex.
[00:40:12.616 --> 00:40:19.341]  And it's also the fact that it does lower the immune system, and you can get the flu shot and still get sick.
[00:40:19.341 --> 00:40:25.987]  I've looked back, and I talk about this in the flu DVD that is now available through InfoWars, is that I've looked at
[00:40:26.567 --> 00:40:37.251]  The data from the CDC over the last 11 years and every year there are testing sites where they take nasal swabs and they send them to the CDC and they say, okay, you've got all these flu-like symptoms.
[00:40:37.251 --> 00:40:38.591]  What is causing you to be sick?
[00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.553]  Is it influenza or is it some other bug?
[00:40:41.553 --> 00:40:49.295]  Because the CDC says the reason you have to get annual flu shots is because the antibodies wear off and you have to have an exact match.
[00:40:49.295 --> 00:40:53.417]  The one that's in the flu shot has to match the one that's in circulation in order to keep you from getting sick.
[00:40:54.017 --> 00:41:04.399]  The exact amount of people who actually get sick from the flu, that it matches what's in the flu shot over the last 11 years, has been less than 13%.
[00:41:04.399 --> 00:41:11.561]  So if the flu shot works at all, which I don't think that it does, in fact I know it doesn't, it will only match 13% of the time.
[00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:23.303]  So you take on all the risk of the flu, the flu shot, all of its ingredients, the fact you can get Guillain-Barré, you can have all sorts of immunosuppressive types of things that can happen from a flu shot, and you can still get the flu anyways.
[00:41:23.783 --> 00:41:25.204]  Absolutely not worth it.
[00:41:25.204 --> 00:41:31.790]  And the multi-dose flu shots that they start giving at children from six months of age, the multi-dose flu shots still have mercury in them.
[00:41:33.021 --> 00:41:41.686]  Well, and while you're talking, we're playing some video over of your documentary presentation, flu and flu vaccines, what's coming through the needle.
[00:41:41.686 --> 00:41:44.768]  I want to talk to you before we end this discussion about that.
[00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:52.812]  But Dr. Tenpenny, we've discovered Rockefeller Foundation documents, perhaps we'll put some up while you're speaking, from 1966-68, saying we need to develop
[00:41:56.778 --> 00:41:59.239]  Sterilants hidden in vaccines.
[00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:01.799]  So basically piggybacking or Trojan horsing.
[00:42:01.799 --> 00:42:05.260]  Then we have the report from 85 where they say this is wonderful.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.441]  We've actually discovered it.
[00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:09.661]  We're going into the implementation phase.
[00:42:09.661 --> 00:42:17.704]  And then as you know, the UN got caught in the mid 90s in Africa and Asia, India and places with the tetanus shots that really had a sterilant in them.
[00:42:19.304 --> 00:42:21.825]  Well, not really even a sterilant.
[00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:26.487]  It caused women to have violent miscarriages in the second trimester.
[00:42:26.487 --> 00:42:28.448]  I mean, I know you're a doctor.
[00:42:28.448 --> 00:42:30.589]  You just focus on the effects of these.
[00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:34.411]  But in the final equation, they know what they're doing.
[00:42:34.411 --> 00:42:37.612]  And this is more than just profit-making.
[00:42:37.612 --> 00:42:41.154]  This is really a medical tyranny from my research.
[00:42:41.154 --> 00:42:47.017]  And I think that's really evidenced by the fact that they, on national news over the weekend, put
[00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:50.738]  Frontman for Merck, up on all the major news shows.
[00:42:50.738 --> 00:43:04.503]  It was bombarding the population, saying not one person's been hurt by Gardasil, and issuing a fake $10,000 challenge at Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, who followed Ron Paul's lead and raised the issue to Rick Perry.
[00:43:06.005 --> 00:43:14.090]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.652]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:43:16.652 --> 00:43:22.035]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:43:22.035 --> 00:43:25.077]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:43:25.077 --> 00:43:27.138]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:43:27.378 --> 00:43:33.642]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:43:33.642 --> 00:43:37.024]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:43:37.024 --> 00:43:42.808]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:43:42.808 --> 00:43:44.449]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:43:44.449 --> 00:43:45.750]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.412]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:43:48.412 --> 00:43:52.634]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:43:52.634 --> 00:43:55.256]  You can find the video at www dot

[00:44:09.495 --> 00:44:11.578]  Folks, we're all fighting huge food prices.
[00:44:11.578 --> 00:44:12.078]  We're good to go.
[00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.172]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[00:44:41.172 --> 00:44:46.316]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline, September 30th.
[00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:50.359]  Free shipping, including Alaska and Hawaii, ends September 30th.
[00:44:50.359 --> 00:44:52.521]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:44:52.521 --> 00:44:56.364]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:44:56.364 --> 00:44:57.945]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:10.976]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:14.218]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:45:14.218 --> 00:45:19.021]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:25.405]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:45:25.405 --> 00:45:27.646]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:28.486]  Tim Geithner?
[00:45:28.486 --> 00:45:28.747]  Bernanke?
[00:45:28.747 --> 00:45:29.307]  They're arsonists!
[00:45:29.307 --> 00:45:30.328]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:32.450]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:45:47.085 --> 00:45:51.467]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:45:51.467 --> 00:45:54.368]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:45:54.368 --> 00:46:03.552]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.391]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:13.694]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:46:13.694 --> 00:46:15.235]  Saving means to make money.
[00:46:15.235 --> 00:46:24.020]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:32.284]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:46:32.284 --> 00:46:40.287]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:46:40.287 --> 00:46:45.510]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.671]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:53.675]  340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsub.com.
[00:46:53.675 --> 00:47:06.826]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsub.com.
[00:47:06.826 --> 00:47:08.367]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:10.408]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:10.408 --> 00:47:13.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:22.725 --> 00:47:41.712]  If you just type, girl died after Gardasil, you get the US, you get Canada, you get England, you get Indian newscasts, where they inject them in the classrooms and girls collapse, have convulsions, and in some cases die of shock within minutes.
[00:47:42.752 --> 00:47:43.973]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:47:43.973 --> 00:47:46.975]  How are they... That's my question.
[00:47:46.975 --> 00:47:48.696]  How are they so bold?
[00:47:48.696 --> 00:47:50.417]  How are they so wild?
[00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:59.081]  I mean, how are they just so brazen when they knew it was killing people in the trials, and they still went ahead and had Perry lie and say it was the law.
[00:47:59.081 --> 00:47:59.962]  Well, he got caught.
[00:47:59.962 --> 00:48:01.083]  It wasn't the law.
[00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:03.224]  And so now they've just moved to go ahead and have a law.
[00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:05.832]  Alex, think about this for a minute.
[00:48:05.832 --> 00:48:33.691]  If you took your two-year-old, your two-year-old child, and you four-postered them on your dining room table, you had four adults hold them down on the table, and you took needle syringes, you took four needles and jabbed them into their thighs, and you injected chemicals, aluminum, formaldehyde, animal cells, human DNA into their legs, and then you went and told your neighbor, and you left that child to cry and scream hysterically for hours, and then you told your neighbor, well, you know, we were just doing a little procedure.
[00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:37.554]  How soon would CPS show up at your door and take those kids away?
[00:48:37.554 --> 00:48:48.622]  But because it's done in a doctor's office, because somebody has on a white coat and somebody trusts you, we think that this is okay, it's harmless, and because it's good for you, it's torture.
[00:48:48.622 --> 00:48:56.609]  It should not be allowed to be happening anywhere, let alone in a school system where some adolescent gets to make a decision about what's injected in their body.
[00:48:56.609 --> 00:48:57.489]  It's a travesty.
[00:48:57.489 --> 00:48:58.030]  It really is.
[00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:09.545]  Well I know this, I was a tough kid and I'd play around in construction zones and have nails go through my foot and break arms and break fingers and was tough and didn't care and wasn't afraid of anything.
[00:49:09.545 --> 00:49:16.413]  But I was horrified of shots and would beg and would plead and I only had a few vaccines in my life.
[00:49:16.974 --> 00:49:20.218]  And now it's more than 50 I know they give children.
[00:49:20.218 --> 00:49:24.985]  Now they want it to be hundreds and they're setting the precedent to try to give them thousands.
[00:49:24.985 --> 00:49:26.366]  This is just incredible.
[00:49:26.366 --> 00:49:30.171]  Now I want to close, Doctor, with their ace in the hole.
[00:49:30.171 --> 00:49:33.616]  You raised this when I was talking to you during the break before we went live here.
[00:49:34.537 --> 00:49:39.620]  And you said the race in the hole is things like contagion with Matt Damon and all this.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:46.344]  There are so many TV shows, movies about mega death, billions dead, not a question of if but when.
[00:49:46.344 --> 00:49:48.445]  You've got to get the shot.
[00:49:48.445 --> 00:50:00.692]  And when you learn that this vaccine industry is a hundred billion dollar industry a year or more, you really see that this is product placement, propaganda placement, and that that's the race in the hole is just scaring the daylights out of people.
[00:50:01.684 --> 00:50:18.317]  Absolutely, and the vision statement of the pharmaceutical industry, which I learned this from a pharmaceutical insider, said that the vision statement of the entire industry is to have every single human on the planet on a minimum of two daily pharmaceutical drugs for their entire life.
[00:50:18.877 --> 00:50:29.780]  Well, how better to do that than to start with young children and making them terribly sick and have all sorts of things from asthma, allergies, eczema, ADD, ADHD, that you can't really connect.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:40.444]  Somebody told me that there was a line from that movie Contagion that said, you know, we need to make this vaccine because if 10 years from now it's causing autism, nobody will be able to connect the dots.
[00:50:40.444 --> 00:50:42.024]  And that's exactly what they're setting up.
[00:50:42.024 --> 00:50:44.765]  They want everybody sick because that promotes their widgets.
[00:50:45.993 --> 00:50:57.795]  It certainly does, and then they have the treatments in development for things that they know in the trials with lab animals is going to cause in Homo sapien sapien, the diabolical nature, the weaponization of this.
[00:50:57.795 --> 00:51:12.438]  I know you've done deep research, but in my film, Endgame, and just through pure research, trying to discover what the globalists, the Rockefellers, stood for, the Rockefellers, the British royalty, the King of England had to advocate over it, funded Hitler.
[00:51:13.258 --> 00:51:15.079]  And wanted worldwide eugenics.
[00:51:15.079 --> 00:51:19.081]  And it was a medical tyranny, forced inoculation, all of it.
[00:51:19.081 --> 00:51:21.883]  And that's basically now what's come here.
[00:51:21.883 --> 00:51:28.507]  It's just an underground program, and that's why Bayer Pharmaceutical and others that came out in court knowingly shipped out HIV blood.
[00:51:28.507 --> 00:51:30.247]  And, hey, it's get rid of the hemophiliacs.
[00:51:30.247 --> 00:51:31.588]  We're doing you a favor.
[00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:34.250]  This is a cold-blooded group.
[00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:37.491]  From my research, it's much bigger than profit.
[00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:39.973]  Have you found the eugenics angle in your research?
[00:51:40.962 --> 00:51:54.941]  I have, and I think that it's, you know, what a lot of people say, and I would have to agree, that when World War II was over, everybody just traded in their uniforms for white coats and business suits.
[00:51:54.941 --> 00:51:55.602]  Nothing changed.
[00:51:55.962 --> 00:51:58.845]  It was like, things just went on as usual.
[00:51:58.845 --> 00:52:01.788]  And I do believe that there is definitely a sinister side.
[00:52:01.788 --> 00:52:09.236]  And the problem that bothers me the most, Alex, is what's wrong with the 800,000 physicians in this country?
[00:52:09.236 --> 00:52:14.882]  That they just march to the tomb of the drug companies, that they're not willing to look at any of this information, or very little of it.
[00:52:15.202 --> 00:52:19.524]  They're not, they don't know what's coming through that needle and being injected into adults and children.
[00:52:19.524 --> 00:52:30.307]  And they just absolutely stand by it and take people like me and you and other people who are exposing the truth and tell colleagues and other physicians say, you're just, you're just, you're just saying all the wrong things.
[00:52:30.307 --> 00:52:31.048]  It's just really not true.
[00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:31.508]  I'll tell you why.
[00:52:32.128 --> 00:52:36.409]  I mean, you're a doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've got family that are physicians.
[00:52:36.409 --> 00:52:46.932]  They are brought up that you're part of the elite now, you know best, and then they're kept so busy that they just receive what the American Medical Association says and they follow it.
[00:52:46.932 --> 00:52:53.233]  And they've been following this system so long, they don't want to admit they were conned and were wrong.
[00:52:53.233 --> 00:52:55.074]  And so they're now committed to it.
[00:52:55.894 --> 00:52:58.599]  And that's basically how tyrannies work.
[00:52:58.599 --> 00:53:06.191]  Once a tyrant or once a corrupt system gets you to join it, then you will rationalize greater and greater crimes.
[00:53:06.191 --> 00:53:08.435]  But we are seeing more and more medical doctors come out.
[00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:11.179]  Not nearly enough.
[00:53:11.179 --> 00:53:24.643]  I mean, really, even physicians who do integrative medicine like I do here in Cleveland, Ohio, I mean, even doctors that have a practice of holistic medicine, they still are, you know, sort of a supporter of vaccinations.
[00:53:24.643 --> 00:53:25.664]  I mean, they really are.
[00:53:25.664 --> 00:53:26.884]  They have really an issue with that.
[00:53:27.443 --> 00:53:29.605]  Well, I mean, I want to be clear.
[00:53:29.605 --> 00:53:38.213]  Certainly from the medical history in the 400 years of vaccination, you can't get some immunity from having something attenuated or weakened.
[00:53:38.213 --> 00:53:41.536]  But then there's the whole issue of, then what does that do to the rest of your immune system?
[00:53:41.536 --> 00:53:45.180]  But now, I think they deceive us by even calling these vaccines.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:50.544]  These are more nanotech, re-engineered viruses.
[00:53:50.544 --> 00:54:00.912]  I mean, now they've got the new classes coming out that re-engineer the brain and attack neurons that would uptake endorphins that, you know... The Funvax.
[00:54:00.912 --> 00:54:01.232]  Exactly.
[00:54:01.232 --> 00:54:03.654]  They're saying, don't be depressed anymore.
[00:54:03.654 --> 00:54:10.079]  I mean, this is re-engineering of society and they just call it vaccines and they think, well, this is like the polio vaccine.
[00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:11.440]  We're saving people.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.683]  Yeah, saving them with hundreds of millions exposed to cancer viruses.
[00:54:15.106 --> 00:54:21.010]  Well, think about all of these girls that we were talking about just a few minutes ago that would get these injections of Gardasil.
[00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.451]  And it could be any of them.
[00:54:23.451 --> 00:54:28.875]  Kids now get 40 doses of 16 different vaccines by the time they start kindergarten.
[00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:32.557]  And one of the things that people have to realize when they're listening to this, and it's school season.
[00:54:32.557 --> 00:54:33.418]  School just started.
[00:54:33.418 --> 00:54:38.021]  And across the country, they've been telling people that parents, no shots, no school.
[00:54:38.021 --> 00:54:41.383]  Well, my answer to that is no shots, no school, not true.
[00:54:41.943 --> 00:54:52.931]  Every state except West Virginia and Mississippi have either a philosophical exemption or a medical exemption for you to opt out of your children being inoculated with all of these things.
[00:54:52.931 --> 00:54:55.693]  So there are a lot of ways that you could stop it.
[00:54:55.693 --> 00:55:00.596]  But every one of these vaccines all have horrible potential side effects.
[00:55:00.596 --> 00:55:11.524]  There is nothing that can come through a needle and try to keep you healthy that you can't do for yourself just by your own diet, exercise, vitamin D, vitamin C and all those things.
[00:55:11.664 --> 00:55:14.326]  Well, Doc, that's another example of a hoax.
[00:55:14.326 --> 00:55:14.886]  Exactly.
[00:55:14.886 --> 00:55:17.508]  They continue to say it's the law.
[00:55:17.508 --> 00:55:18.389]  You've got to take it.
[00:55:18.389 --> 00:55:20.911]  And that's what's so wonderful about Perry being caught.
[00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:21.852]  We called him.
[00:55:21.852 --> 00:55:23.313]  It came out he didn't have the authority.
[00:55:23.313 --> 00:55:24.353]  It wasn't the law.
[00:55:24.353 --> 00:55:25.794]  And now he has to apologize.
[00:55:25.794 --> 00:55:27.676]  And all the other candidates are against him.
[00:55:27.676 --> 00:55:32.620]  That has certainly gotten the death merchants of the vaccine makers
[00:55:33.521 --> 00:55:38.232]  On the defensive, like I've never seen them before.
[00:55:38.232 --> 00:55:40.779]  Now, what about the other two states?
[00:55:40.779 --> 00:55:42.663]  There are still ways to get exemptions there, correct?
[00:55:43.792 --> 00:55:48.973]  Well, West Virginia and Mississippi really only have a medical exemption and it's very hard to get.
[00:55:48.973 --> 00:55:51.694]  Their state health departments are very adamant about it.
[00:55:51.694 --> 00:55:58.575]  In fact, I've even had some parents in Mississippi tell me that the state health department wants them to vaccinate their kids even if they're homeschooling.
[00:55:58.575 --> 00:56:03.276]  And so, those two states are the only two states that just have a medical exemption.
[00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:07.817]  Most of the time, you can only get that for a particular vaccine for which you've had a reaction.
[00:56:08.157 --> 00:56:17.806]  I mean, even if you have an ill child and you say, I don't want them to have the vaccines, the medical doctors, who again are the problems, will say, oh, well, it's because your child is sick.
[00:56:17.806 --> 00:56:21.909]  They need the vaccines more than ever because you don't want them to get those vaccine-preventable diseases.
[00:56:21.909 --> 00:56:25.613]  Well, as a medical doctor, you know, until two years ago, they said never vaccine a pregnant woman.
[00:56:25.613 --> 00:56:26.594]  Now they're saying it's good.
[00:56:27.503 --> 00:56:38.910]  Oh, not only are they saying that it's good, Alex, they're talking about flu shots, pertussis vaccines, they're talking about hepatitis B, and they're even potentially talking about giving Gardasil vaccines to pregnant women.
[00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:52.578]  Well, well, Dr. Jen Penny, we're going to have to have you back up in the near future to get into all the other attacks that are happening, but the good news is, and I think you've basically agreed with me today, the report is, the worm is starting to turn, the pendulum is starting to swing, the awakening is here.
[00:56:53.138 --> 00:56:53.678]  I really do.
[00:56:53.678 --> 00:57:01.680]  I think that it's really, you know, when I started this 11 years ago, there were just a few of us, you know, out in the lone, just really talking about this.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:08.002]  I truly believe that tens of millions of people, not only in this country but around the world, are waking up and they're just saying no.
[00:57:08.002 --> 00:57:12.943]  What are the best websites for people to visit to see all the scientific documentation that you've amassed?
[00:57:14.296 --> 00:57:20.118]  Going to DrTenpenny.com.
[00:57:20.118 --> 00:57:28.901]  That's where we're soon to be launching an entire library of all the research that I put together through DrTenpenny.com.
[00:57:28.901 --> 00:57:33.182]  My clinic in Cleveland is Tenpenny IMC, like Iris Mary Charlie.
[00:57:33.182 --> 00:57:35.263]  That's Tenpenny Integrated Medical Center.
[00:57:35.263 --> 00:57:36.503]  TenpennyIMC.com.
[00:57:36.503 --> 00:57:42.385]  We're here in Cleveland, Ohio and I'm always proud to say that people have come from 39 states and 12 countries to get well and off their drugs.
[00:57:42.805 --> 00:57:45.867]  Well, if I ever need your help, I'm definitely coming to you.
[00:57:45.867 --> 00:57:47.769]  You are certainly a guardian angel out there.
[00:57:47.769 --> 00:57:49.510]  Thank you so much, Doctor.
[00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.471]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:57:55.933 --> 00:58:00.476]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.397]  Number 1.
[00:58:01.397 --> 00:58:04.820]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:05.680]  Number 2.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:10.564]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:10.564 --> 00:58:11.304]  It's true.
[00:58:11.304 --> 00:58:16.188]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:17.009]  Number 3.
[00:58:17.009 --> 00:58:20.591]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:24.294]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:24.494 --> 00:58:25.295]  Number 4.
[00:58:25.295 --> 00:58:28.057]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:28.057 --> 00:58:31.741]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:32.522]  Number 5.
[00:58:32.522 --> 00:58:36.665]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:36.665 --> 00:58:41.430]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:02.817 --> 00:59:07.958]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:07.958 --> 00:59:09.839]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:59:12.031 --> 00:59:22.996]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:59:25.169 --> 00:59:29.772]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:59:29.772 --> 00:59:33.614]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:59:33.614 --> 00:59:34.835]  Others don't.
[00:59:34.835 --> 00:59:36.976]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:36.976 --> 00:59:38.757]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:38.757 --> 00:59:41.659]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:41.659 --> 00:59:45.902]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:59:45.902 --> 00:59:48.283]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:59:50.985 --> 00:59:53.346]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:59:53.346 --> 00:59:54.227]  Others don't.
[00:59:56.897 --> 01:00:00.480]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.683]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:29.564]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:55.814]  Geoengineering goes under the microscope in Australia, one of their major states.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:08.183]  And more and more other scientists are pointing out there are secretive and now public geoengineering programs going on that governments claim are to protect us from this and that, but the whole thing is super creepy.
[01:01:08.183 --> 01:01:09.564]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[01:01:09.564 --> 01:01:17.386]  It's also come out that Diebold, and we'll go to that slide here in a moment, Diebold voting machines can be hacked by remote control.
[01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:23.348]  This has been proven for a decade, but now they're being hacked with $10 pieces of equipment.
[01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:30.855]  And again, that's about all of us more and more losing our rights, but not being able to admit that we're being defrauded.
[01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:31.996]  But then it gets worse.
[01:01:31.996 --> 01:01:35.699]  First they said it was a joke, but now it's been confirmed that it was not a joke.
[01:01:35.699 --> 01:01:44.488]  She seriously told the media, the North Carolina governor suggested suspending elections to spur economic solutions.
[01:01:44.488 --> 01:01:47.231]  She said because people will be removed from office,
[01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:50.573]  If they do things that aren't popular, suspend elections.
[01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:53.815]  That's what Governor Bev Perdue, a Democrat, said.
[01:01:53.815 --> 01:01:58.799]  And now, they've already suspended the Congress, the General House, controlling spending bills.
[01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:02.021]  That's now done by a committee of 12 tyrants.
[01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:05.344]  So, just an incredible, incredible time to be alive.
[01:02:05.344 --> 01:02:09.466]  Finally, I want to play a clip of our good friend Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:02:10.367 --> 01:02:15.509]  He had the district attorney on, the prosecutor in Orange County, California.
[01:02:15.509 --> 01:02:27.174]  You know, that's nearby where that homeless guy who did nothing got beaten to death by the cops, and the cops covered it up at first, but finally they've done the right thing, and they've charged one cop with premeditated murder, the other with manslaughter.
[01:02:27.174 --> 01:02:35.198]  And the district attorney pointed out, if cops in the wrong are beating you to death, you have a right to defend yourself with lethal force.
[01:02:35.198 --> 01:02:38.039]  That's common sense, that's common law, and that's what 1776 is all about.
[01:02:40.265 --> 01:02:48.831]  What can an ordinary person do to resist unlawful violence when the violence is perpetrated by the police?
[01:02:48.831 --> 01:03:00.980]  Well, you know, to begin with, we do have a United States constitutional right to be free from unlawful or unwarranted excessive force under color of law.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.361]  So that part doesn't vary from state to state.
[01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:09.065]  And I think that citizens, or everybody, not just citizens, but we all have a right to self-defense.
[01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:12.889]  Wow!
[01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:17.812]  I mean, I shouldn't say wow, but more and more people are just speaking the obvious, speaking the truth.
[01:03:17.812 --> 01:03:19.934]  We all got a right to defend ourselves.
[01:03:19.934 --> 01:03:28.739]  And it was on record, this homeless guy, who's schizophrenic, his dad, by the way, was a retired cop, was just like, and they just beat him to death.
[01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:34.123]  Reportedly, like doing knee drops in his head for like 20 minutes.
[01:03:34.123 --> 01:03:39.887]  I mean, what is... They're hiring a bunch of weenies who like to gang up five at a time on people.
[01:03:40.643 --> 01:03:41.263]  That's what it is.
[01:03:41.263 --> 01:03:47.068]  I mean, no respecting, self-respecting man wants to beat up people who didn't start a fight with you.
[01:03:47.068 --> 01:03:51.291]  I mean, it's almost shameful when a bully starts a fight and you break their jaw.
[01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:53.573]  Not that I've done that myself, but I've read about it.
[01:03:53.573 --> 01:03:57.095]  I mean, it is just so pathetic.
[01:03:57.095 --> 01:03:57.976]  And that's good.
[01:03:57.976 --> 01:04:01.619]  I hope they stick a needle in that cop's arm, and I hope they send him to hell.
[01:04:02.557 --> 01:04:08.123]  Because beating some guy to death who was begging for his mommy and his daddy, all on tape, doing nothing.
[01:04:08.123 --> 01:04:11.286]  I mean, there's nothing more cowardly than cops doing knee drops over and over.
[01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:12.847]  I'm killing a homeless person!
[01:04:12.847 --> 01:04:13.888]  I'm tough!
[01:04:13.888 --> 01:04:15.951]  What the hell is wrong with you?
[01:04:15.951 --> 01:04:16.391]  Well, you know what?
[01:04:16.391 --> 01:04:17.692]  You're gonna get strapped down to a gurney.
[01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:23.135]  Because murder one is on your ass, premeditated murder, and you're going to see how it is.
[01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:23.795]  Okay?
[01:04:23.795 --> 01:04:28.217]  Because we don't like weak people being targeted by the strong, by a bunch of wolves.
[01:04:28.217 --> 01:04:30.298]  And society is starting to wake up.
[01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:32.519]  Now, good cops, we support you.
[01:04:32.519 --> 01:04:34.340]  And if you defend yourself, that's great.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.840]  We'll protect you under common law.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:45.964]  But when you like to beat up and kill homeless people or shoot a black kid in handcuffs in the back and say that he was attacking you and that comes out, you don't deserve a year or two in jail like the San Francisco case.
[01:04:45.964 --> 01:04:47.105]  You deserve to go to prison.
[01:04:47.826 --> 01:04:50.445]  For you deserve, an eye for an eye, the killing you engaged in.
[01:05:09.326 --> 01:05:10.586]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:10.586 --> 01:05:14.507]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:14.507 --> 01:05:16.908]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:16.908 --> 01:05:22.609]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:29.270]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:35.251]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:35.251 --> 01:05:38.912]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:05:39.432 --> 01:05:43.716]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:43.716 --> 01:05:49.681]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:49.681 --> 01:05:53.223]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:53.223 --> 01:05:55.205]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:55.205 --> 01:05:56.326]  It's here.

[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:24.355]  We're joined by the best-selling author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, as well as one of his latest books, Pudwink, John Perkins.
[01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.257]  John, great to have you back.
[01:06:26.257 --> 01:06:27.479]  Good to be with you, Alex, again.
[01:06:27.479 --> 01:06:27.759]  Thank you.
[01:06:28.553 --> 01:06:35.518]  I've been interviewing you, I don't know, five, six years since your first book came out, and you predicted much of what has now unfolded.
[01:06:35.518 --> 01:06:46.365]  We're seeing the very same private banking cartels telling the European Union now, transfer all of your existing rights and sovereignty to a new private financial order.
[01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:52.612]  And I see Bloomberg News admitting, yes, national sovereignty and democracy in Germany is the problem.
[01:06:52.612 --> 01:06:58.159]  We need bankers ruling everything or we're going to have a global economic implosion.
[01:06:58.159 --> 01:07:00.742]  Is this by design or does it even matter?
[01:07:00.742 --> 01:07:04.327]  Because at the end of the day, we are seeing a global banking dictatorship set up.
[01:07:05.226 --> 01:07:08.348]  I don't think there's any question, Alex, that it's by design.
[01:07:08.348 --> 01:07:15.911]  The people at the top, what I call the corporatocracy, the people who run our biggest corporations around the world, they know what they're doing.
[01:07:15.911 --> 01:07:17.072]  They know what's going on here.
[01:07:17.072 --> 01:07:19.253]  And they want it to happen this way.
[01:07:19.253 --> 01:07:20.233]  It's by design.
[01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:22.374]  They're taking control.
[01:07:22.374 --> 01:07:27.337]  You know, we've moved from a time a few hundred years ago when religious organizations pretty much ran the world.
[01:07:27.837 --> 01:07:28.919]  Thank you very much.
[01:07:43.464 --> 01:07:45.025]  They certainly are.
[01:07:45.025 --> 01:07:56.572]  Talk about some of the big power players from your perspective, and for viewers who may not know who you are, tell us a little bit about your experience that's unique to be able to make the assessment you've made today.
[01:07:56.572 --> 01:08:01.775]  Well, my official title was Chief Economist at a major consulting firm in Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:08:01.775 --> 01:08:03.436]  This is back in the 70s.
[01:08:03.436 --> 01:08:04.976]  I was really an economic hitman.
[01:08:04.976 --> 01:08:12.561]  I arranged huge loans for countries that had resources that corporations coveted from places like the World Bank and the private banking industry.
[01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:15.002]  Money never actually went to those countries.
[01:08:15.002 --> 01:08:28.827]  It went instead to our own corporations to build big infrastructure projects in those countries, like power plants and industrial parks, that benefited a few wealthy people in those countries, as well as our own corporations, but didn't help the majority of the people.
[01:08:28.827 --> 01:08:30.228]  Too poor to buy electricity.
[01:08:30.228 --> 01:08:33.429]  Couldn't get jobs in industrial parks because they don't hire many people.
[01:08:33.429 --> 01:08:37.871]  And yet they, the people of the country, were left holding a huge debt they couldn't repay.
[01:08:37.871 --> 01:08:40.672]  So we go back at some point and say, hey, since you can't pay your debts,
[01:08:41.192 --> 01:08:45.816]  Sell your oil to our oil companies real cheap, or your mineral resources, whatever.
[01:08:45.816 --> 01:08:47.838]  Open your markets to us.
[01:08:47.838 --> 01:08:50.320]  Let us build a military base on your soil.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.323]  Vote with us on the next critical United Nations vote.
[01:08:53.323 --> 01:08:59.668]  And in the few cases where these leaders didn't go along with what we wanted them to, what we call the jackals went in.
[01:08:59.668 --> 01:09:02.150]  These are people that assassinate or overthrow governments.
[01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:07.495]  And because I couldn't bring Jaime Roldos, President of Ecuador, around, or Monterrey, House of Panama, they were both
[01:09:08.035 --> 01:09:09.717]  Assassinated in this process.
[01:09:09.717 --> 01:09:18.325]  It's a pretty insidious method, but it's a new way of forming empire and it's turned out to be extremely successful and it's bringing us all apart.
[01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:30.585]  Well, if one thing is clear, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the other big mega global banks are totally ruthless and really revel in oppression and destroying societies.
[01:09:30.585 --> 01:09:37.927]  And as you pointed out, they go in and build their own infrastructure that's taxpayer paid for.
[01:09:37.927 --> 01:09:41.368]  So the public pays for the services, but also pays for the investment.
[01:09:42.128 --> 01:09:45.489]  And then the country goes into impossible to pay off debts.
[01:09:45.489 --> 01:09:55.253]  I've seen numbers of Nigeria, they get a billion dollar loan over the last 30 years, pay it for 50 billion and still owe tens of billions of dollars.
[01:09:55.253 --> 01:10:02.876]  And now this very structure is being used on the West, breaking down what we're seeing happen in Europe and here in the US.
[01:10:02.876 --> 01:10:08.118]  What is the end game of these big mega banks and corporations that have grown up around them?
[01:10:08.718 --> 01:10:09.999]  It's total control.
[01:10:09.999 --> 01:10:11.819]  It's a new form of empire.
[01:10:11.819 --> 01:10:20.063]  It's an empire that isn't created primarily through the military, although the military is right there always to back up these corporations if they get into trouble.
[01:10:20.063 --> 01:10:26.065]  But it's this form of empire that's being built around debt and fear.
[01:10:26.065 --> 01:10:38.070]  And in a way, it dates back to the old feudal empires, where you had these castles around the countryside, and you had a few what we call the bourgeoisie people that lived around the outsides of the castles.
[01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:50.557]  And they were kept there, they kept having to give a huge percentage of their crops, or whatever they did, blacksmiths, whatever work they did, they had to donate it to the lord of the castle and his knights.
[01:10:50.557 --> 01:10:53.519]  Or they felt that they would be attacked by somebody from another castle.
[01:10:53.979 --> 01:11:04.870]  We're very much in that mentality today, except today the castle is the big corporations, and the lords are the CEOs of those corporations, and their knights are all the henchmen that work for them.
[01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:06.331]  Very, very similar situation.
[01:11:06.331 --> 01:11:09.214]  And yes, we're seeing it in the United States, we're seeing it in Europe.
[01:11:09.214 --> 01:11:17.462]  I'm on my way to Istanbul to speak at a major conference there of leaders from many Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries.
[01:11:17.962 --> 01:11:20.084]  They're experiencing it big time.
[01:11:20.084 --> 01:11:22.385]  And people are beginning to understand what's happening.
[01:11:22.385 --> 01:11:27.689]  That's why we're having these uprisings, what we call the Arab Spring, and many other parts of the world.
[01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:32.272]  We're seeing people begin to really get informed and demonstrate against this.
[01:11:32.272 --> 01:11:46.843]  Zbigniew Brzezinski told the Council on Foreign Relations last year that for the first time in history, quote, all of humanity is awake and staring at the elite, not at their puppet front men, and that the elite had a big problem.
[01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:59.247]  How do you see the kleptocrats, the corporate fascists, whatever you want to call them, how do you see them trying to maintain and expand this control?
[01:11:59.247 --> 01:12:08.251]  Because I see their undoing being they're so good at wrecking societies and knocking out their competition and destroying...
[01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:10.572]  Economic diversity.
[01:12:10.572 --> 01:12:16.437]  They're such an incredible corporate borg that in the final equation they must be overthrown.
[01:12:16.437 --> 01:12:20.060]  I mean, it's almost built in that it's an overreach.
[01:12:21.687 --> 01:12:37.920]  Yes, and well, you know, what we're seeing now is a classic battle, really a war between those in control, the guys who run the castle, and those who used to sit outside the castle, quietly serving those in the castle.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.184]  And now, kind of like the Robin Hood coming along, finally saying, this isn't fair, this isn't going to work anymore.
[01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:54.757]  And so at that point, the people in the castle, the corporatocracy, the people who are running our big corporations, really dig in harder and harder.
[01:12:54.757 --> 01:12:56.979]  And let's face it, today they own the U.S.
[01:12:56.979 --> 01:13:03.127]  Congress and basically every other political leader in the world in any so-called democracy.
[01:13:03.767 --> 01:13:10.535]  Nobody gets elected to President of the United States or Congress without the financial support from these corporations.
[01:13:10.535 --> 01:13:14.059]  It used to be that our elected officials in the United States wrote the laws.
[01:13:14.059 --> 01:13:15.861]  Today, it's the corporations.
[01:13:15.861 --> 01:13:16.702]  It's their lobbyists.
[01:13:16.702 --> 01:13:19.865]  They pass them to the elected officials whom they own.
[01:13:19.865 --> 01:13:21.507]  And yet, we're really seeing it.
[01:13:22.348 --> 01:13:30.255]  And I think when Obama got elected, there was a great hope amongst the people on the left, or the liberals, or progressives, whatever you want to call it.
[01:13:30.255 --> 01:13:38.542]  But they've come to see that this liberal Democrat, in many respects, is not very different from a conservative Republican.
[01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:42.242]  We're all really beginning to get it now.
[01:13:42.242 --> 01:13:47.143]  And as we get it, we're going to expect the status quo to dig in even more strongly.
[01:13:47.143 --> 01:13:49.364]  And that's exactly what's happening today.
[01:13:49.364 --> 01:13:54.085]  You're having the people rising up in many places, Washington, D.C.
[01:13:54.085 --> 01:13:59.967]  now, Wall Street, in addition to the Middle East and the Far East and Latin America and Africa.
[01:13:59.967 --> 01:14:08.409]  And at the same time, the status quo of those in control of the corporatocracy are going to get, are going to dig in harder and harder and harder.
[01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:22.239]  We're talking to John Perkins, best-selling author, New York Times, what, number one best-selling author, economic hitman, of course, he also put out Hoodwinked, I had read, coming up in a few months, it's coming out in paperback, invaluable reading.
[01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:28.603]  You know, I do radio interviews, as you do, and TV interviews all over the world, and so many times they bring up John Perkins.
[01:14:28.603 --> 01:14:31.345]  They say, well, what you're talking about, have you heard of John Perkins?
[01:14:31.345 --> 01:14:32.966]  I'm like, of course I have.
[01:14:32.966 --> 01:14:37.990]  And correct me if I'm wrong, but you are an admitted self-described former knight
[01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:49.200]  Of these guys, a former henchman, or I guess you could say almost a financial and political cutthroat of Prince John.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:58.468]  But now you've kind of joined Robin Hood and the Merry Men from being on the inside and going to the Pentagon and having meetings and getting the walking orders and all of that.
[01:14:58.468 --> 01:15:05.073]  Now being here today, knowing the mindset of the plutocrats, when you say they're going to dig in,
[01:15:05.974 --> 01:15:12.061]  How do you expect him to dig in as somebody who formerly served Darth Sidious?
[01:15:12.061 --> 01:15:14.323]  Well, you hit the nail on the head there, Alex.
[01:15:14.323 --> 01:15:15.744]  Yes, I did do all those things.
[01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:24.413]  And incidentally, the system is so insidious that when I did it, I came out of business school, I thought I was doing the right thing because business schools, in essence, teach us.
[01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:33.536]  If we want to be good economists, if we want to be good managers, we need to be the knights that serve these Darth Vader's, as you put it.
[01:15:33.536 --> 01:15:38.857]  That's what we're taught, and so for a long time I bought into that because I've been taught that was the right thing to do.
[01:15:38.857 --> 01:15:49.099]  But the deeper I got into the system, the more I could see how terrible and insidious it is and anti-democratic and anti-everything we in the United States believe that we believe in.
[01:15:49.819 --> 01:15:52.142]  Hello, this is Steve Shank with the
[01:16:13.217 --> 01:16:22.301]  eFoods Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:27.123]  During September eFoods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[01:16:27.123 --> 01:16:31.245]  But you have to understand we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[01:16:31.245 --> 01:16:38.128]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed
[01:16:38.528 --> 01:16:39.088]  I think so.
[01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:07.422]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:14.346]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:17:14.346 --> 01:17:16.908]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:17:16.908 --> 01:17:22.271]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:25.333]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:27.394]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:17:27.634 --> 01:17:33.878]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:17:33.878 --> 01:17:37.260]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:43.063]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:17:43.063 --> 01:17:44.684]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:17:44.684 --> 01:17:45.985]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:17:45.985 --> 01:17:48.666]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:17:48.666 --> 01:17:50.067]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:17:50.347 --> 01:17:52.868]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:57.490]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:17:57.490 --> 01:18:00.091]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:18:00.091 --> 01:18:03.952]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:18:03.952 --> 01:18:04.953]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:18:07.239 --> 01:18:11.921]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:18.365]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:20.646]  Number one, study the past.
[01:18:20.646 --> 01:18:23.027]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:18:23.027 --> 01:18:26.749]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:18:27.887 --> 01:18:30.968]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:18:30.968 --> 01:18:34.809]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:39.850]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.851]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:47.272]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:18:47.272 --> 01:18:50.913]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:18:51.753 --> 01:18:56.700]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:01.327]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:19:01.327 --> 01:19:03.490]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:19:06.832 --> 01:19:10.853]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:19:10.853 --> 01:19:14.094]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:14.094 --> 01:19:18.895]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:19:18.895 --> 01:19:25.277]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:25.277 --> 01:19:27.518]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:19:28.058 --> 01:19:28.378]  Tim Geithner?
[01:19:28.378 --> 01:19:28.658]  Bernanke?
[01:19:28.658 --> 01:19:29.219]  They're arsonists!
[01:19:29.219 --> 01:19:29.999]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:31.279]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:46.966 --> 01:19:49.086]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:49.086 --> 01:19:54.247]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:19:54.247 --> 01:20:07.090]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.610]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.670]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:13.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:31.866 --> 01:20:40.671]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:54.793 --> 01:20:55.013]  2A 3.30 (-0.99), 3F 5.30 (-0.99),
[01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:19.790]  When you get people into this kind of debt, you have tremendous control over them.
[01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:30.142]  So you start to demand that in order to have a little bit of debt relief, they have to sell off their public utility companies or other public sector
[01:21:31.403 --> 01:21:32.984]  Thank you very much.
[01:21:58.058 --> 01:22:00.601]  When you're deep in debt, you don't rebel.
[01:22:00.601 --> 01:22:02.063]  Because you don't want to lose your house.
[01:22:02.063 --> 01:22:05.567]  You don't want to lose the food on your table to serve your family.
[01:22:05.567 --> 01:22:07.609]  So you basically become a eunuch.
[01:22:07.609 --> 01:22:08.650]  And they like that.
[01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:10.753]  That's what's going on today, Alex.
[01:22:10.753 --> 01:22:11.513]  Around the world.
[01:22:13.535 --> 01:22:14.876]  I've been asking the questions here.
[01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:21.480]  I'd like you to spend a few minutes on any topics or points that you think are really central to understanding the big picture here.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.803]  And I'd also like you to look into your crystal ball, if you can, and describe where you see this going.
[01:22:29.284 --> 01:22:37.438]  Giant Awakening, New Renaissance, Enlightenment, whatever you want to call it, but the Empire is going to strike back to continue with the Star Wars analogy.
[01:22:37.438 --> 01:22:42.868]  So any other points that you think are important and then again elaborate on where you see things going.
[01:22:43.444 --> 01:22:48.126]  Well, I think we have to all understand, each of us, that we have tremendous power.
[01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:53.769]  That these corporations only survive and thrive because we buy their goods and services.
[01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:58.011]  And we've sent this message to them that we want cheap t-shirts.
[01:22:58.011 --> 01:23:03.373]  And if that means being made by slaves in sweatshops in Indonesia, we'll just look the other way.
[01:23:03.373 --> 01:23:05.054]  We want cheap petroleum for our cars.
[01:23:05.054 --> 01:23:08.535]  If that means destroying rainforests, we'll just look the other way.
[01:23:08.535 --> 01:23:09.936]  We've got to now send a new message.
[01:23:10.296 --> 01:23:18.519]  We've got to tell these corporations that we expect them to serve the public interest, which is something they were mandated to do during the first hundred years that the United States was a country.
[01:23:18.519 --> 01:23:23.061]  That changed in the late 1800s when the Supreme Court had a turnaround.
[01:23:23.061 --> 01:23:29.924]  But we need to send this message out again that these corporations are there to serve our interests and we'll only buy from corporations that do that.
[01:23:29.924 --> 01:23:37.227]  And to recognize the power we have, we got rid of apartheid in South Africa when I was in college by boycotting corporations that supported it.
[01:23:37.367 --> 01:23:41.692]  We got them to open their doors wider to women and minorities and get rid of trans fats.
[01:23:41.692 --> 01:23:43.494]  We have tremendous power.
[01:23:43.494 --> 01:23:47.519]  The marketplace is democratic if we choose to make it such.
[01:23:47.519 --> 01:23:56.390]  I would like to suggest that probably the vote that we make each time we buy something or choose not to is more important than the vote we make every two years when we go to the polls.
[01:23:56.830 --> 01:24:02.112]  So we the people need to understand that we have to take responsibility here and we can foment a revolution.
[01:24:02.112 --> 01:24:04.033]  We don't have to pick up guns.
[01:24:04.033 --> 01:24:12.315]  We just have to let these corporations know that we're only going to vote for the ones that are committed to making a better world for us, our children and grandchildren.
[01:24:12.315 --> 01:24:16.417]  Those that are committed to being good public servants, to serving us.
[01:24:17.472 --> 01:24:23.893]  Well, a microcosm of that is you couldn't find organic food 10, 15 years ago on store shelves.
[01:24:23.893 --> 01:24:27.174]  Now, it's displacing a lot of the garbage.
[01:24:27.174 --> 01:24:34.256]  Or you see examples of people not wanting Bisphenol A-lined plastic goods, and now it's being pulled out of many of the products.
[01:24:34.256 --> 01:24:39.137]  I mean, we see the examples of the fact that we do vote with our pocketbook.
[01:24:39.137 --> 01:24:43.638]  People should support alternative media, authors, TV shows, websites.
[01:24:44.738 --> 01:24:51.923]  And they should boycott the big corporate media when it engages in the type of propaganda it has.
[01:24:51.923 --> 01:24:55.465]  And I think what you're saying, John, in closing, is look in the mirror.
[01:24:55.465 --> 01:25:11.096]  It's easy to make some judgment about a big corrupt Fortune 100 that we know is doing horrible things, but it's our empowerment, it's our buying its goods and going along with it that is literally basically buying war bonds to fund its operation.
[01:25:11.596 --> 01:25:21.781]  And so at the end of the day, we're being hypocrites when we sit here on a high horse criticizing these global corporatists because it really is us who've allowed this to happen.
[01:25:21.781 --> 01:25:23.141]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:23.802]  Absolutely.
[01:25:23.802 --> 01:25:25.382]  I totally agree with you.
[01:25:25.382 --> 01:25:30.545]  And Nelson, you know, we really need to insist that these corporations create a new economy.
[01:25:31.005 --> 01:25:35.148]  Right now the economy of the United States is totally dependent on the military.
[01:25:35.148 --> 01:25:43.233]  I'm shocked by how people talk about balancing the budget, but there's no way we can balance the budget until we cut back the military budget, which is huge.
[01:25:43.233 --> 01:25:49.657]  And most of that just goes to creating things that get destroyed and destroy other people and make enemies for us around the world.
[01:25:50.217 --> 01:25:52.879]  Well, now they need to turn that around.
[01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:54.400]  There's so many opportunities.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:03.005]  I speak a lot at MBA programs, and I encourage these young people coming up into the business world to form their own companies.
[01:26:03.005 --> 01:26:08.989]  We all know alternative energy is important, but what about creating new technologies for helping starving people in Africa?
[01:26:09.409 --> 01:26:10.050]  We're good to go.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:42.048]  We really need to create a new economy that's not based on the military and also not based on just selling each other trinkets, which we're also very good at, or selling each other derivatives and pieces of paper that lawyers and bankers trade around and don't create any jobs or help anybody in any way.
[01:26:42.048 --> 01:26:43.869]  We really need to take a good look at that.
[01:26:43.869 --> 01:26:47.931]  And you and I and all of your listeners are the people that can make that happen.
[01:26:47.931 --> 01:26:51.273]  We just have to become conscious and take positive action.
[01:26:51.969 --> 01:26:56.754]  And we've got to watch out for counterfeits because everything you've said makes total sense.
[01:26:56.754 --> 01:27:06.102]  We need to develop a new economy, not a war economy where we now see the military industrial complex more and more taking over domestic operations, spying on the people.
[01:27:06.102 --> 01:27:10.827]  We have to realize this military industrial complex does not serve our sovereignty or our liberty.
[01:27:10.827 --> 01:27:12.789]  It serves this global corporate system and
[01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:16.111]  Well, I'm very hopeful that we're going to win.
[01:27:16.111 --> 01:27:16.732]  We the people.
[01:27:39.147 --> 01:27:43.368]  We're going to turn this thing around, and I see evidence of that in what's going on in South America.
[01:27:43.368 --> 01:27:45.169]  Huge revolution down there.
[01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:49.210]  Democratic, market-based revolution.
[01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:50.390]  We're seeing it in the Middle East.
[01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:51.411]  We're seeing it in China.
[01:27:51.411 --> 01:27:52.231]  We're seeing it in Asia.
[01:27:52.231 --> 01:27:53.711]  We're seeing it in Europe.
[01:27:53.711 --> 01:27:55.412]  We're beginning to see it in the United States.
[01:27:55.412 --> 01:27:59.053]  I'm very hopeful, but we don't know what ultimately will happen.
[01:27:59.053 --> 01:28:02.674]  But each one of us has to get involved and push harder for this.
[01:28:03.534 --> 01:28:05.496]  And that's how it will happen.
[01:28:05.496 --> 01:28:14.483]  So, I don't know the outcome, but I'm very hopeful that we, the people, are rising to a new level of consciousness, and we will get there.
[01:28:14.483 --> 01:28:29.315]  And incidentally, Alex, I'd really encourage people to subscribe to my newsletter at JohnPerkins.org, visit me on Facebook, Twitter, economic underscore hitman, and keep this conversation going, because I'd really like to talk with your audience on a continuing basis.
[01:28:29.315 --> 01:28:30.456]  John Perkins, God bless you.
[01:28:31.036 --> 01:28:31.699]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:31.699 --> 01:28:32.823]  I'd love to join you again.
[01:28:32.823 --> 01:28:34.348]  Keep up your good work.
[01:28:34.348 --> 01:28:35.030]  You too, my friend.
[01:29:00.572 --> 01:29:02.483]  No!
[01:29:02.483 --> 01:29:02.684]  No!
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.061]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:20.923]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:29:20.923 --> 01:29:25.544]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:29:25.544 --> 01:29:36.366]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:29:37.006 --> 01:29:46.508]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:46.508 --> 01:29:51.930]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:59.431]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:59.431 --> 01:30:01.832]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:30:06.144 --> 01:30:07.304]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:07.304 --> 01:30:14.227]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:14.227 --> 01:30:16.788]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:16.788 --> 01:30:22.170]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:22.170 --> 01:30:25.211]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:27.272]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:27.532 --> 01:30:33.777]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:33.777 --> 01:30:37.159]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:37.159 --> 01:30:42.943]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:44.584]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:44.584 --> 01:30:45.885]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:45.885 --> 01:30:48.547]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:48.547 --> 01:30:52.790]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:55.372]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:30:55.472 --> 01:30:58.997]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[01:31:11.255 --> 01:31:15.539]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:15.539 --> 01:31:20.423]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:20.423 --> 01:31:21.164]  It's true.
[01:31:21.164 --> 01:31:26.869]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:26.869 --> 01:31:30.452]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:34.155]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:35.156]  Number 4.
[01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:37.919]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:37.919 --> 01:31:41.603]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:41.603 --> 01:31:42.383]  Number 5.
[01:31:42.383 --> 01:31:46.548]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:46.548 --> 01:31:51.293]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:51.593 --> 01:31:55.757]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:55.757 --> 01:31:57.539]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:12.712 --> 01:32:21.800]  E-Foods Direct has been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:26.604]  During September, E-Foods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[01:32:26.604 --> 01:32:30.747]  But you have to understand, we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[01:32:30.747 --> 01:32:37.633]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[01:32:38.013 --> 01:32:41.094]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[01:32:41.094 --> 01:32:46.255]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline September 30th.
[01:32:46.255 --> 01:32:50.276]  Free shipping including Alaska and Hawaii ends September 30th.
[01:32:50.276 --> 01:32:52.456]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:32:52.456 --> 01:32:56.577]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:32:56.577 --> 01:32:58.778]  Remember you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:33:07.085 --> 01:33:10.666]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:10.666 --> 01:33:14.486]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:14.486 --> 01:33:33.650]  For more than 60 years, the federal government in the United States, as well as many other governments across the planet, have carried out an elaborate hoax designed to convince the public that fluoride is added to most water supplies to improve oral hygiene.
[01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:36.653]  This report will examine the facts.
[01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:42.699]  Hundreds of chemicals are added to municipal water supplies, all under the name fluoride.
[01:33:42.699 --> 01:33:51.567]  Sodium fluoride and its variants are the chemical byproducts of aluminum fertilizer, cement, steel, and nuclear weapons manufacturing.
[01:33:52.563 --> 01:33:58.789]  Children who ingest fluoride will actually get a form of tooth decay called dental fluorosis.
[01:33:58.789 --> 01:34:01.731]  Dark brown stains and tooth decay.
[01:34:01.731 --> 01:34:05.875]  The American Dental Association recently put out a nationwide alert.
[01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:11.841]  In the memo, they warned parents not to make baby formula using fluoridated water.
[01:34:12.816 --> 01:34:18.137]  Fluoride is the active ingredient in many pesticides, like rat poison.
[01:34:18.137 --> 01:34:24.519]  Fluoride has been proven to cause brain damage, reduced IQ, impairs memory and learning.
[01:34:24.519 --> 01:34:28.500]  It has been conclusively shown to cause damage in the kidneys.
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:34.081]  It has been directly linked to bone disease, bone cancer, reduced thyroid activity.
[01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:37.465]  And it has also been proven that it's linked to other cancers.
[01:34:37.465 --> 01:34:46.157]  Unfortunately, this is only the beginning of the list of medical issues directly related to the ingestion of fluoride.
[01:34:46.157 --> 01:34:51.084]  After years of attempting to get the city of Austin to allow our crew in to show
[01:34:51.104 --> 01:34:52.765]  I don't think that's what it is, though.
[01:34:52.765 --> 01:34:54.906]  Those tanks are in that building.
[01:34:54.906 --> 01:34:56.566]  So there's tank two and tank one.
[01:35:22.953 --> 01:35:38.944]  A tour guide even jokingly pointed out the fact that the fluoride acid would eat holes in the concrete and paint.
[01:35:38.944 --> 01:35:40.825]  See this corrosion here?
[01:35:40.825 --> 01:35:42.807]  This is not corroding just from the air.
[01:35:42.807 --> 01:35:45.529]  This is from acid vapors in here, okay?
[01:35:45.529 --> 01:35:48.591]  So they've had to go in and it looks like replace this, okay?
[01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:50.212]  They had to take it out, it looks like.
[01:35:50.772 --> 01:35:58.884]  Here you can see the pipes where they lovingly pump the carcinogenic brain-eating chemical weapon into you and your children's water supply.
[01:35:59.645 --> 01:36:07.931]  This type of fluoride-based acid has the CDC's highest danger rating of number four.
[01:36:07.931 --> 01:36:15.095]  Again, it is in the most dangerous class of chemicals, with an MSDS health rating of four.
[01:36:15.095 --> 01:36:16.416]  Life-threatening.
[01:36:16.416 --> 01:36:21.400]  Major or permanent damage may result from a single or repeated exposure.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.580]  Organ failure.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.501]  Cancer.
[01:36:23.501 --> 01:36:26.363]  The list goes on and on.
[01:36:26.363 --> 01:36:29.345]  All purposely pumped into your water supply.
[01:36:30.346 --> 01:36:43.240]  If sodium fluoride and its other variants are so dangerous, then why are more than 70% of US cities forcing it on their citizens as a form of forced medication?
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.162]  Eugenics is the long-standing plan.
[01:36:45.242 --> 01:36:51.548]  The Nazis knew that the brain damaging effects of fluoride would enable them to control the populations with more ease.
[01:37:07.743 --> 01:37:13.428]  Today, fluoride is being forced upon Americans in more than 70% of the country.
[01:37:13.428 --> 01:37:16.391]  This is not law, it is a federal mandate.
[01:37:16.391 --> 01:37:32.126]  Because the population is becoming aware and medical doctors are speaking out, the feds are now lobbying states like Arkansas to pass laws commanding local governments to add high levels of sodium fluoride to their water supplies.
[01:37:32.666 --> 01:37:43.628]  As Americans are becoming more educated about the issue, many activists are standing up to water fluoridation and laying the groundwork for taking it out of their water supply.
[01:37:43.628 --> 01:37:47.649]  Dr. Paul Conant is the Executive Director of the Fluoride Action Network.
[01:37:47.649 --> 01:37:55.471]  Thanks to Dr. Conant's efforts, the Calgary City Council voted 10 to 3 to remove toxic substances from their public drinking water.
[01:37:56.164 --> 01:38:04.570]  A few days ago it was finalized that Calgary in Alberta, that's 1.1 million people, are now going to be fluoride free.
[01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:06.732]  Now many other cities in the U.S.
[01:38:06.732 --> 01:38:09.214]  and across the world are following suit.
[01:38:09.214 --> 01:38:12.136]  And that's why the establishment is striking back.
[01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:20.822]  Tim Cameron of Mount Clemens City, Michigan, proposed to his city council to have all fluoride removed from the tap water and won with a 6-0 vote.
[01:38:22.083 --> 01:38:22.984]  Agenda item 9C.
[01:38:22.984 --> 01:38:28.887]  Request commission approval of a resolution rescinding the addition of fluoride at the City of Mount Clemens water filtration plant.
[01:38:28.887 --> 01:38:30.508]  I need a motion please.
[01:38:30.508 --> 01:38:36.932]  Motion to approve a resolution rescinding the addition of fluoride at the City of Mount Clemens water filtration plant.
[01:38:36.932 --> 01:38:38.113]  Second.
[01:38:38.113 --> 01:38:39.253]  Campbell?
[01:38:39.253 --> 01:38:39.633]  Yes.
[01:38:39.633 --> 01:38:40.154]  Grieger?
[01:38:40.154 --> 01:38:40.514]  Yes.
[01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:41.014]  Gager?
[01:38:41.014 --> 01:38:41.415]  Yes.
[01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:42.035]  Hill?
[01:38:42.035 --> 01:38:42.335]  Yes.
[01:38:42.335 --> 01:38:42.795]  Jones?
[01:38:42.795 --> 01:38:43.176]  Yes.
[01:38:43.176 --> 01:38:43.716]  Blesch?
[01:38:43.716 --> 01:38:44.056]  Yes.
[01:38:44.056 --> 01:38:45.297]  Motion carries unanimously.
[01:38:46.345 --> 01:38:51.387]  That's what one man did by simply presenting the scientific facts to his council.
[01:38:51.387 --> 01:39:02.011]  State Representative Dr. Joe Hensley of Tennessee sent letters to every district in his state urging them to stop adding fluoride to the drinking water and has had very successful results.
[01:39:02.811 --> 01:39:13.715]  In future reports we will document the fact that under the name fluoride upwards of 300 plus chemicals are legally added to your water supply.
[01:39:13.715 --> 01:39:23.719]  Americans are forced to drink a literal toxic waste stew that is left over from different industries who would have to pay to store the toxic waste.
[01:39:23.719 --> 01:39:28.901]  Instead our cities in some cases pay millions of dollars a year for the poison.
[01:39:28.901 --> 01:39:30.242]  The good news is people
[01:39:30.462 --> 01:39:33.886]  All over the world, not just the United States, are waking up.
[01:39:33.886 --> 01:39:41.394]  Right here in Austin, we're seeing more and more restaurants advertising that they have fluoride-free, healthy, clean, filtered water.
[01:39:41.394 --> 01:39:45.919]  Our reporter Darren McBreen traveled to one of these restaurants to talk to the owner.
[01:39:45.919 --> 01:39:46.600]  Darren McBreen.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:47.820]  Thanks Alex.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:53.062]  We're standing outside of Hopdoddy's, a local hamburger restaurant located in South Austin.
[01:39:53.062 --> 01:40:01.966]  Now this is just one of the many restaurants in town choosing organic and locally produced ingredients over GMO and conventionally farmed foods.
[01:40:01.966 --> 01:40:05.527]  However, Hopdoddy's has taken this trend one step further.
[01:40:05.527 --> 01:40:11.550]  They're also removing the fluoride as well as other toxins from the drinking water that they serve their customers.
[01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:20.836]  You'd be surprised that it's a small percentage that really appreciate it, but the ones that do understand what fluoride does to you, they are ecstatic.
[01:40:20.836 --> 01:40:22.417]  They love seeing that.
[01:40:22.417 --> 01:40:30.602]  Sodium fluoride is a chemical byproduct of aluminum, phosphate, cement, steel, and nuclear weapons manufacturing.
[01:40:31.062 --> 01:40:34.606]  It reduces IQ, impairs memory and learning.
[01:40:34.606 --> 01:40:37.109]  It has shown to poison kidney function.
[01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:43.357]  It causes bone disease as well as reduced thyroid activity and is a proven cause of cancer.
[01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:48.779]  Well, not only is it bad for humans, it's also bad for animals of all kinds as well.
[01:40:48.779 --> 01:40:52.881]  I just don't understand why fluoride needs to be in the water to begin with.
[01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:55.382]  I do not think it belongs in our water supply.
[01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:59.443]  It's for promoting tooth health, oral hygiene, stuff like that.
[01:40:59.443 --> 01:41:01.004]  It's supposed to be good for your teeth.
[01:41:01.004 --> 01:41:06.486]  Anything in the water supply doesn't sound like something that I'd be for.
[01:41:06.486 --> 01:41:11.908]  So if I know something's being put into a water supply that doesn't necessarily have to be there, I'd rather it not be there.
[01:41:12.228 --> 01:41:23.152]  Back in elementary school they made you like gargle that stuff and like and like wash your mouth out with it but I just remember it made me sick every time I had it so it's like I don't know if it needs to be in my water.
[01:41:23.152 --> 01:41:24.393]  I think it's just awful.
[01:41:24.393 --> 01:41:27.034]  I don't think anything should be added to the water supply that doesn't need to be added.
[01:41:27.034 --> 01:41:29.595]  It just it just sounds scary.
[01:41:29.595 --> 01:41:34.217]  Anything that's being put into a city's water supply without without everybody's consent.
[01:41:34.457 --> 01:41:41.464]  So would you like to see all the restaurants turn the corner like you are and remove the fluoride from the drinking water that they serve their customers?
[01:41:41.464 --> 01:41:49.172]  Well, I'd like to see the city turn the corner and remove all the fluoride and not burden everyone with putting RO systems in their restaurants.
[01:41:49.172 --> 01:41:50.954]  I think that'd be the best way to do it.
[01:41:50.954 --> 01:41:56.080]  But I think that we can get the word out by doing that and I would love to see more restaurants do that.
[01:41:56.428 --> 01:42:02.474]  Well, you know, a lot of advocates are starting to educate people and more and more people are becoming aware of the dangers of sodium fluoride.
[01:42:02.474 --> 01:42:11.323]  In fact, right down the street, Hopdotties, they've made a cautious decision to remove the sodium fluoride from the drinking water that they serve their customers.
[01:42:11.323 --> 01:42:12.084]  What do you think about that?
[01:42:12.444 --> 01:42:13.205]  I think it's great.
[01:42:13.205 --> 01:42:15.407]  I actually go over there quite a bit.
[01:42:15.407 --> 01:42:16.408]  I appreciate it, yeah.
[01:42:16.408 --> 01:42:19.571]  I don't want... If they can filter out anything, the more filtration, the lot of the better.
[01:42:19.571 --> 01:42:23.094]  I think it's great that they're standing by something they believe in.
[01:42:23.094 --> 01:42:25.196]  I'd like it if a lot more businesses started to do that.
[01:42:25.196 --> 01:42:29.519]  They actually spent the money to take it out of their own water supply.
[01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:30.700]  I think that's pretty cool.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.702]  They don't need to spend money to take it out.
[01:42:32.702 --> 01:42:34.464]  It just needs to not be there to begin with.
[01:42:34.824 --> 01:42:39.127]  I'd like it personally if Austin stopped putting the fluoride in the water altogether.
[01:42:39.127 --> 01:42:46.072]  The majority of people we talk to on the street flat out don't approve of sodium fluoride being added to their water.
[01:42:46.072 --> 01:42:56.078]  Which is why we applaud individual activists and activist groups like the Fluoride Action Network, who stand in the way of fluoridating public water supplies.
[01:42:56.078 --> 01:43:01.662]  And thanks to restaurants like HopDotty's playing a role in the health of their customers and their community.
[01:43:01.662 --> 01:43:04.384]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:43:07.365 --> 01:43:09.086]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:09.086 --> 01:43:14.387]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:43:14.387 --> 01:43:15.908]  Saving means to make money.
[01:43:15.908 --> 01:43:24.691]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:43:25.431 --> 01:43:32.976]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:43:32.976 --> 01:43:40.981]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:46.204]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:43:46.204 --> 01:43:48.365]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:44:07.612 --> 01:44:10.135]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:44:10.135 --> 01:44:11.417]  Tyranny is here.
[01:44:11.417 --> 01:44:15.041]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:44:15.041 --> 01:44:17.584]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:22.630]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:44:23.431 --> 01:44:30.100]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:36.069]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:44:36.069 --> 01:44:39.754]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:44:40.254 --> 01:44:44.558]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:44:44.558 --> 01:44:50.503]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:44:50.503 --> 01:44:54.045]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:44:54.045 --> 01:44:56.027]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:44:56.027 --> 01:44:57.168]  It's here.

[01:45:06.263 --> 01:45:12.908]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:45:12.908 --> 01:45:18.052]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:45:18.052 --> 01:45:26.779]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:45:26.779 --> 01:45:30.862]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:45:30.862 --> 01:45:33.224]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:45:35.134 --> 01:45:39.877]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:45:39.877 --> 01:45:43.700]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:44.941]  Others don't.
[01:45:44.941 --> 01:45:47.082]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:45:47.082 --> 01:45:48.864]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:45:48.864 --> 01:45:51.746]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:45:51.746 --> 01:45:55.989]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:45:55.989 --> 01:45:58.390]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:46:01.092 --> 01:46:03.454]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:46:03.454 --> 01:46:04.255]  Others don't.
[01:46:05.595 --> 01:46:09.031]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck with an urgent update from eFoods Direct.
[01:46:13.575 --> 01:46:21.721]  We've been doing all we can this year to help you get food before the perfect storm of exploding food prices from the 2011 harvest.
[01:46:21.721 --> 01:46:26.545]  During September, eFoods is giving you free shipping on your food supply orders.
[01:46:26.545 --> 01:46:30.668]  But you have to understand, we're entering the eye of the food cost storm.
[01:46:30.668 --> 01:46:37.573]  Ethanol is boosting gas prices and driving corn costs so high our wheat for bread is going into animal feed.
[01:46:37.953 --> 01:46:41.035]  And pasta wheat cost has doubled since last year.
[01:46:41.035 --> 01:46:46.199]  I strongly advise you to get your order in before the free shipping deadline September 30th.
[01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:49.621]  Free shipping including Alaska and Hawaii ends September 30th.
[01:46:49.621 --> 01:46:50.942]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:46:50.942 --> 01:46:52.423]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:46:52.423 --> 01:46:54.804]  Remember, you can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:47:07.133 --> 01:47:10.014]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:10.014 --> 01:47:14.056]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:14.056 --> 01:47:19.558]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:50.839]  I noticed that Facebook, after Infowars.com and Natural News and others in the last few days wrote articles about Facebook admitting that, okay, they do track you everywhere you go even after you log out of Facebook, they've now apologized and say they're going to stop.
[01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:58.005]  Just like the founder of Facebook called you dumb bleepers last year when it first started to come out.
[01:47:59.707 --> 01:48:05.589]  TomTom, two years ago, got caught selling your data and tracking you, the GPS company, and said they'd stop.
[01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:09.530]  They were in the news again yesterday, caught again, and they said, don't worry, we'll stop.
[01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:14.552]  This is a psychological warfare operation.
[01:48:14.552 --> 01:48:18.373]  Look, there's a going for broke hoax happening.
[01:48:18.373 --> 01:48:27.976]  All over the country, they go on the news in the week before school and say, it's the law, go to this sports stadium and get your free shots.
[01:48:30.026 --> 01:48:33.647]  There is no law.
[01:48:33.647 --> 01:48:40.710]  Twelve years ago, the federal government signed secret deals made public last year to take all the death benefits of all U.S.
[01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:47.373]  military personnel from World War II through to today.
[01:48:47.373 --> 01:48:52.075]  The government now admits that they're growing the opium in Afghanistan.
[01:48:52.075 --> 01:48:54.896]  It has now been confirmed in two federal courts
[01:48:56.141 --> 01:48:59.603]  They've had district attorneys go public on the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:48:59.603 --> 01:49:05.265]  Sheriffs have gone public on this show years ago, but in the news this week.
[01:49:05.265 --> 01:49:07.126]  That indeed, the U.S.
[01:49:07.126 --> 01:49:14.410]  government allows select drug cartels to bring in unlimited tonnage of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.
[01:49:16.101 --> 01:49:16.662]  I don't know.
[01:49:33.238 --> 01:49:46.508]  In one shop alone were ordered to basically sell at rock bottom prices paid for with taxpayer money to the Sinaloa Cartel 2000 firearms out of one shop alone.
[01:49:46.508 --> 01:49:48.830]  That came out two days ago.
[01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:50.191]  We've covered it.
[01:49:50.191 --> 01:49:52.333]  But I mean, think about what this means.
[01:49:52.333 --> 01:49:55.115]  This morning, last night, this morning, today,
[01:49:56.474 --> 01:50:16.604]  I thought about just dropping everything for about a week, not doing the nightly news or having Aaron do it or others do it, not doing the radio show, and just chronicling, digging through all of our massive research, and assembling thousands of pieces of bedrock government corruption.
[01:50:17.401 --> 01:50:39.896]  Where it's absolutely admitted that they nerve gassed and killed our own troops in test, or shot up little kids with syphilis, or fed pesticide to CPS-grabbed kids just a few years ago, or are growing the opium in Afghanistan, or the CIA caught shipping cocaine in hundreds and hundreds of times, and guns into Mexico.
[01:50:41.614 --> 01:50:48.676]  And DynCorp and Halliburton and the Pentagon and the UN caught running giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:50:48.676 --> 01:50:55.118]  And I mentioned that yesterday, DynCorp child trafficking, and it was Chicago Tribune, BBC.
[01:50:55.118 --> 01:50:56.419]  You also see our articles there.
[01:50:56.419 --> 01:51:00.440]  But the point is, it just hits me every moment.
[01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:11.311]  That it's so overwhelming, it's so ridiculous how over-the-top the corruption is, and how naive we are.
[01:51:11.311 --> 01:51:22.662]  You know, I talk to repair people that come to my house, I talk to people on the street, and I get a lot of feedback, and I talk to people who've never heard of my show.
[01:51:23.737 --> 01:51:29.102]  And if you talk to somebody who is awake, they won't shut up, you know, telling you about things because they care.
[01:51:29.102 --> 01:51:29.802]  They're informed.
[01:51:29.802 --> 01:51:30.423]  Wow!
[01:51:30.423 --> 01:51:37.669]  They know what's happening in the world and they want to stop it because they want to live in a better society and they understand history.
[01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:43.313]  But when you talk to people that aren't aware, they don't know about secret spying.
[01:51:43.313 --> 01:51:48.037]  They don't know about bio-warfare soft kill operations.
[01:51:48.037 --> 01:51:50.980]  They don't know what sodium fluoride's doing to them, admitted fact.
[01:51:53.519 --> 01:52:06.549]  Almost every EPA scientist themselves, multiple times for over a decade, has signed petitions and said, please take it out of the water, it increases cancer, and they give all the evidence for it.
[01:52:06.549 --> 01:52:17.937]  I mean, more and more when I sit here and I go over all the news and all the information, even before I go on air, it's just...
[01:52:21.365 --> 01:52:26.630]  It's mainly that the general public is in a trance.
[01:52:26.630 --> 01:52:27.610]  And you talk to them.
[01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:43.184]  I mean, I remember 12 years ago or so, documenting that OnStar was listening to you all the time with NSA computers, nonstop transcribing everything you say and do in your car.
[01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:54.855]  And I reported it and I got attacked and called a kook.
[01:52:54.855 --> 01:52:56.537]  Even though I had the documentation.
[01:52:56.537 --> 01:53:04.905]  And then this morning I'm listening to local talk radio, you know the big talk station, and I hear the talk show host
[01:53:06.493 --> 01:53:23.961]  With the co-host reading out of the news that, okay, wow, OnStar actually listens to you with the microphone built into the cell phone on the dash, even when you turn it off, and they sell it all to government insurance companies, and they're tracking everything you do, and everywhere you go, and putting it into databases.
[01:53:23.961 --> 01:53:26.002]  And the other host said, well, I don't have a problem with that.
[01:53:26.002 --> 01:53:27.463]  I think that's good.
[01:53:27.463 --> 01:53:29.644]  They want to take care of us.
[01:53:29.644 --> 01:53:31.284]  And he wasn't being sarcastic.
[01:53:31.284 --> 01:53:32.225]  The other host said, really?
[01:53:32.225 --> 01:53:33.585]  And he goes, yeah.
[01:53:33.585 --> 01:53:34.226]  Everybody.
[01:53:35.106 --> 01:53:37.167]  Should have to have these in their cars.
[01:53:37.167 --> 01:53:42.229]  Well, actually, the federal government's come out for more than a decade and said that that's their plan.
[01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:44.350]  See, here's the problem with doing this show.
[01:53:44.350 --> 01:54:00.617]  Just while I was sitting there talking, I remembered a month ago, Epoch Times reported on it, but it was also in other publications, if I try to pull this up, that Chinese, Chinese government putting tracker systems in cars.
[01:54:01.508 --> 01:54:23.484]  And they call it a toll road system that you have to have in your car for many of the roads being toll roads, but the tech publications have analyzed it and found that it's actually a wireless tracker beacon and has a wireless audio sensor in it and that they are listening to people in their cars.
[01:54:23.484 --> 01:54:26.706]  It's basically an OnStar chip, a little cell phone transmitter.
[01:54:30.216 --> 01:54:36.641]  And it's like, oh my gosh, the Communist Chinese, aren't they incredibly Dacronian?
[01:54:36.641 --> 01:54:40.864]  So my point is, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[01:54:40.864 --> 01:54:42.626]  And I say that a lot.
[01:54:42.626 --> 01:54:49.451]  I mean, you don't need some loud mouth, obnoxious Texan up here to tell you all of this.
[01:54:49.451 --> 01:54:54.695]  But then it begs the question, why isn't more being done about this?
[01:54:54.695 --> 01:54:57.698]  Why aren't more of you angry and upset and involved?
[01:55:00.342 --> 01:55:18.593]  In the final equation, I don't like having a scientific dictatorship built over me by a bunch of control freaks who fall over one another to write books and publications calling for the reduction of the human population of 80% or more.
[01:55:18.593 --> 01:55:26.117]  They start at 80% and then have big debates and we've written countless articles on it and showed you their documents and made the film Endgame.
[01:55:28.174 --> 01:55:35.316]  Where, you know, they put out articles defending Dr. Pianca at UT that says 90% need to be killed.
[01:55:35.316 --> 01:55:41.577]  And sooner rather than later with the airborne Ebola.
[01:55:41.577 --> 01:55:46.339]  And I had his graduate students send me threatening emails and I went and looked them up.
[01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:49.539]  These were doctors and chemists and biologists.
[01:55:49.539 --> 01:55:51.540]  A couple of them working in bioweapons facilities.
[01:55:54.278 --> 01:55:56.279]  And it was like, you know, he's a very great man.
[01:55:56.279 --> 01:56:00.142]  And by the way, you ought to be glad that he's so liberal.
[01:56:00.142 --> 01:56:09.347]  Most of us believe humans are a disease and it will be a sheer pleasure to kill the final human.
[01:56:09.347 --> 01:56:14.230]  And then I'm the bad guy for being against this.
[01:56:14.230 --> 01:56:19.594]  They have troops growing opium on ABC News, BBC and Fox telling us it's good.
[01:56:21.022 --> 01:56:26.386]  Every major vaccine manufacturer, when they study the vaccine, it's designed to do the opposite of what you're told.
[01:56:26.386 --> 01:56:35.594]  The Gardasil, clearly, and Dr. Tim Penney agrees, is a autoimmune disorder weapon.
[01:56:38.757 --> 01:56:44.344]  These other vaccines, you look at them, they're filled, chop, chop filled with cancer viruses.
[01:56:44.344 --> 01:56:45.845]  So is the Gardasil.
[01:56:45.845 --> 01:56:46.646]  It's hidden in plain view.
[01:56:46.646 --> 01:56:49.510]  It turns out, oh wow, this isn't really attenuated.
[01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:52.453]  This isn't just the protein of the RNA of the virus.
[01:56:52.453 --> 01:56:58.781]  It's a full RNA shell combined with the aluminum, so it's going to bind with your DNA.
[01:57:00.117 --> 01:57:02.538]  I mean, it's hidden in plain view.
[01:57:02.538 --> 01:57:04.079]  It's a bio weapon.
[01:57:04.079 --> 01:57:07.321]  And of course it's screwing women up and screwing young girls up.
[01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:10.643]  And there's all these thousands and thousands of horror stories.
[01:57:10.643 --> 01:57:18.708]  And right at 24% of all vaccine adverse reactions reported to the federal system are Gardasil.
[01:57:18.708 --> 01:57:23.070]  By the way, on average, 2% report adverse reactions.
[01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:26.812]  So if it's 18, well now it's 20 plus thousand, I was corrected.
[01:57:26.812 --> 01:57:29.053]  If it's 22,000 and growing, and that's 2%,
[01:57:31.323 --> 01:57:32.905]  Holy mackerel.
[01:57:32.905 --> 01:57:34.206]  And again, I haven't even gotten the news.
[01:57:34.206 --> 01:57:36.068]  You know, I'll just read you some headlines when we come back.
[01:57:36.068 --> 01:57:39.311]  It's just, at a certain point, what is the point?
[01:57:39.311 --> 01:57:42.374]  Like, trying to convince people, hey, man, the government's out of control.
[01:57:42.374 --> 01:57:43.775]  It really is.
[01:57:43.775 --> 01:57:46.078]  Don't you want to be free?
[01:57:46.078 --> 01:57:50.322]  It's so creepy to have these killers over us.
[01:57:50.322 --> 01:57:53.805]  And it's so obvious what they're doing, it should be easy to bring them down.
