[00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:10.327]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:11.768]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:13.469]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.692]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:22.335]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.727 --> 00:00:31.771]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Friday, February 25th edition of the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:33.852]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:44.698]  I'll be filling in just for the first couple of segments of today's show as Alex does live interviews and Alex will be back at about 20 past the hour.
[00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:56.744]  As you know, the unfolding, escalating crisis in Libya and the Middle East, North African region continues to rage.
[00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:04.728]  The Obama administration and the Pentagon are now preparing to launch a multilateral invasion
[00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:09.910]  ...of Libya with the complicity of the United Nations and NATO.
[00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:14.993]  Serious discussions now on the table for that eventuality.
[00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:20.436]  And of course, it's all going to be on humanitarian grounds.
[00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:30.941]  Nothing to do with the fact that the US military-industrial complex failed to overthrow Gaddafi in the 80s and they want a second bite at the cherry.
[00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:39.746]  And of course, I'm sure it's nothing to do with the fact that Libya has the largest supply of oil reserves in the whole continent of Africa.
[00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.107]  Complete coincidence, I'm sure.
[00:01:43.308 --> 00:02:01.950]  And now, the same US military-industrial complex that has killed well over a million innocent people in the last 10 years, including several hundreds a year, annually, with the Predator drone bombings, deaths of innocent people, has now suddenly found a conscience!
[00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:19.413]  And it's concerning itself with the humanitarian plight of the people of Libya and this is the excuse now being forwarded as the pretext for military assault on the country with the acquiescence of NATO and the United Nations.
[00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:20.414]  CNN!
[00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:26.641]  Analysts, more Libyan bloodshed could prompt US-NATO intervention.
[00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:40.456]  If the US military were to intervene in an increasingly chaotic Libya, it would most likely be part of a NATO action in which Libyan bloodshed has reached a humanitarian crisis, analysts said Thursday.
[00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:55.388]  Military intervention, quote, is something which I hope doesn't happen, but it looks as though at some point that it should happen, said Simon Henderson, Senior Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
[00:02:55.748 --> 00:03:04.852]  So now we've got all these big globalist NGOs coming out, laying the groundwork for this military invasion of Libya as the crisis escalates.
[00:03:04.892 --> 00:03:09.134]  We've got the entire global corporate establishment media in cahoots.
[00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:13.538]  Uh, aggressively pushing Gaddafi as this horrible dictator.
[00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:22.408]  Which he is, but he is a horrible dictator with the aid of British-made weapons, which he's now been- which are now being used to subjugate his own population.
[00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:27.914]  And of course, uh, they have to portray Gaddafi as the monster who kills his own people.
[00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:38.061]  Just as they did with Saddam Hussein, who they also sold the weapon to do so, to create that pretext for, quote, humanitarian military intervention.
[00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:56.735]  And now you have two of the most odious and self-serving lawmakers in the history of the United States, Lieberman and McCain, saying that Obama should arm the rebels there in Libya, which, of course, the whole rebel campaign is being run out of Washington, D.C., as we documented.
[00:03:57.555 --> 00:04:09.418]  And basically bankroll an insurgency war against Gaddafi with US taxpayers' money, even as Americans struggle to afford their own grocery bill.
[00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:26.342]  So while you're going to be made to cut back, while people are getting their welfare sliced in half, while people are being forced to double their pension and healthcare contributions, that money's all going to be spent on a nice little military intervention in the oil rich.
[00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:28.644]  African country of Libya.
[00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:29.946]  Bloomberg.
[00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:34.292]  Gaddafi cracks down on Tripoli as Sarkozy calls for departure.
[00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:43.965]  Muammar Gaddafi tried to tighten his grip on Tripoli as French President Nicolas Sarkozy called on him to resign amid reports that worshippers were being shot as they left Mosul.
[00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:44.545]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.640]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.343]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:11.883]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:17.345]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:20.306]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.647]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:28.811]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:32.334]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:38.058]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:39.599]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.180]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.762]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:47.966]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:52.630]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.192]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:05.199]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:11.481]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:18.942]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:23.804]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:26.244]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:32.567]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:35.068]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:06:35.088 --> 00:06:35.429]  Call us!
[00:07:01.902 --> 00:07:16.328]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:21.076]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:34.060]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:42.082]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:52.367]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:56.410]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.272]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:01.893 --> 00:08:07.436]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:12.365]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:14.467]  Alex will be back in the next segment.
[00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:16.168]  Associated Press.
[00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:19.470]  Qaddafi militia opens fire on Libya protesters.
[00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:32.660]  Militias loyal to Muammar Qaddafi opened fire Friday on protesters streaming out of mosques and marching across the Libyan capital to demand the regime's ouster, witnesses said, reporting at least four killed.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:39.805]  In rebellious cities in the east, tens of thousands held rallies in support of the first Tripoli protests in days.
[00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:46.269]  And now we have Reuters reporting that rebels now control the oil fields in the east of the country.
[00:08:46.849 --> 00:08:50.892]  Libyan rebels say control oil fields honour deals.
[00:08:51.693 --> 00:09:02.940]  Rebels in eastern Libya said on Friday they now controlled most of the oil fields east of the town of Ras Lanuf and said they would honour oil deals as long as they were in the interests of the people.
[00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:10.125]  Now that's interesting because we posted another Reuters story this morning on PrisonPlanet.com which said that
[00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:21.335]  Oil supplies and oil plants are completely unaffected by this, so either somebody's exaggerating or there have been some dramatic developments in the past few hours.
[00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:26.681]  Another Reuters story, Libya oil production to shut down completely.
[00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:28.442]  Bank of America.
[00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:40.386]  Reuters, oil production in Libya is expected to shut down completely and could be lost for a prolonged period of time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Thursday.
[00:09:40.787 --> 00:09:53.831]  Quote, we expect Libyan production to be shut down completely and we might lose sweet crude from Libya for a prolonged period of time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Sabine Schells told Reuters.
[00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:54.731]  So,
[00:09:56.664 --> 00:10:00.868]  There was a rumour of Gaddafi being shot yesterday, that jacked up oil prices.
[00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:04.912]  Last time I looked today they were either flat or slightly down.
[00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:17.423]  So all this is working towards the benefit of the crowd, the globalists, the post-industrial revolutionaries who want to push oil up to at least $200 a barrel.
[00:10:17.463 --> 00:10:21.367]  We had the report a couple of days ago from the big investment firm that said
[00:10:22.047 --> 00:10:28.574]  If this continues to escalate, expect oil to shoot up to $220 a barrel in no time.
[00:10:28.614 --> 00:10:34.099]  And of course, you know precisely what that does to gas prices, which are already so high.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:41.386]  So I've seen the groundwork now being laid for a US-NATO, UN-led humanitarian
[00:10:41.966 --> 00:11:02.438]  War on Libya, which will of course garner the enthusiastic backing of an army of leftist interventionists who so vehemently opposed George Bush for launching such wars, even though they were only slightly different in the fact that they were launched under a different pretext.
[00:11:03.218 --> 00:11:21.798]  And isn't it interesting that myself and Alex predicted that the Obama administration would do precisely what we now see unfolding, namely launch new wars on tricked-up and contrived humanitarian grounds.
[00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:24.481]  In an article we wrote, which you can
[00:11:25.242 --> 00:11:26.144]  Google search.
[00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:30.010]  It's entitled, The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same.
[00:11:31.492 --> 00:11:33.876]  This was an article we wrote in November 2008.
[00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:40.032]  You know, nearly three and a half years ago before Obama even took office.
[00:11:41.213 --> 00:12:01.247]  And in that piece we warned that Obama was even more dangerous than Bush in many ways because he could launch his wars with the aid of left cover and not have to deal with the same level of vitriol that Bush did when he launched his invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:11.787]  And this is the exact quote from the article again written nearly three and a half years ago by myself and Alex Jones before Obama even took office.
[00:12:11.888 --> 00:12:16.933]  Quote, Obama may eventually withdraw a portion of troops from Iraq.
[00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:19.189]  And that's exactly what happened.
[00:12:19.229 --> 00:12:22.453]  They withdrew a token amount, replaced them with contractors.
[00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:24.516]  Continuing quote.
[00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:33.428]  But mark our words, they won't be home long before they are sent off to bomb another broken, backed, third world country.
[00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:49.401]  This time, in the name of a United Nations-backed humanitarian war, just as Bill Clinton presided over in Somalia and Serbia with the full support of the establishment political left.
[00:12:49.962 --> 00:13:01.651]  Lo and behold, this so-called revolution now sweeping the region gives the globalists and their stooge Obama the exact pretext to do just that.
[00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:14.451]  So, what we predicted nearly three and a half years ago, that Obama would be the man, just as Clinton was, to launch humanitarian wars, is now unfolding before our very eyes.
[00:13:16.394 --> 00:13:19.257]  And, uh, you know, we're not boasting about it.
[00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:35.431]  It's easy to tell what these people are going to do because they pull the same political and geopolitical tricks over and over again with their, you know, WWE-style Republican-Democrat tag-team offensive.
[00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:38.875]  Which the American people fall for every time.
[00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:48.085]  Under a Republican, you get an aggressive, pre-emptive war, if not more than one, which is supported by conservatives.
[00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:55.212]  And under a Democrat, you have a, quote, humanitarian war, which is supported by liberals.
[00:13:56.033 --> 00:14:11.360]  So either way it's war, and either way the US, UK, EU, Israeli industrial complex reaps the windfall as well as the geopolitical leverage over the region.
[00:14:12.802 --> 00:14:23.792]  And, you know, remember Joe Biden, the Vice President, promised that Obama would be faced with an international crisis that he would have to deal with and make unpopular decisions.
[00:14:24.752 --> 00:14:28.716]  And it seems like Libya could now well be that crisis.
[00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:40.146]  And we called it three and a half years ago in this article in which we said that Obama was the perfect man to front so-called humanitarian wars.
[00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:54.261]  So, now we see the same global corporate establishment media that, of course, bit its collective tongue as nearly a million Iraqis were slaughtered.
[00:14:54.822 --> 00:15:06.171]  It's the same establishment media that brushes over the deaths of hundreds of innocent people killed by predator drones in Pakistan and Afghanistan every year.
[00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:09.373]  But now, they've suddenly found their conscience!
[00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:25.278]  And just by a miraculous coincidence, they've managed to discover that conscience, just as the New World Order launches a series of colour revolutions to reshape the Middle East in their image.
[00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:28.059]  And of course, North Africa as well.
[00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:38.178]  Let's just not mention the fact that the weapons Gaddafi is using to slaughter his own people were mostly purchased from Britain.
[00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:50.067]  You know, companies like Lockheed Martin, which are now conducting the census in Britain to steal and track all our information and put us all in terror databases because of our religion or our beliefs.
[00:15:51.288 --> 00:15:58.232]  Let's not mention the fact that David Cameron, in the past few days, has been on a tour of the region.
[00:15:58.512 --> 00:16:03.494]  Just by coincidence, it happened to have been occurring after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak.
[00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:14.980]  Accompanied by no less than eight, count them, eight representatives from defence firms selling weapons and bombs.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.962]  Oh, very convenient timing there.
[00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:30.217]  So you've got Cameron swooping in to sell them all the weapons, these post-revolutionary governments, which, of course, at the moment in Egypt is nothing more than a military dictatorship.
[00:16:31.778 --> 00:16:49.432]  Simultaneously, you have the US government and the European Union preparing a new Marshall Plan for the Middle East, they call it, preparing to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money, again, even as they tell taxpayers to tighten their belts.
[00:16:50.489 --> 00:17:00.100]  Basically buying off these post-revolutionary governments as a means of hijacking, manipulating and steering the entire revolt.
[00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:11.674]  And I wrote an article on PrisonPlanet.com a couple of days ago, speaking to this fact that the US and the EU are now swooping in and buying off all these governments.
[00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:29.980]  A report out of the Australian, quote, in the US, Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico, a leading Democrat, foreign policy thinker, and a confidant of President Obama, told the Times, quote, Western governments need to think of this as a Marshall Plan type moment.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.182]  And a dramatic change in the world's security order.
[00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:36.363]  Here's another quote.
[00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:43.447]  A senior official from the EU, US, Japan and Australia prepared for an emergency summit on the Middle East in Brussels this week.
[00:17:43.947 --> 00:17:53.552]  Mr. Richardson added, quote, we have to find a way to get on the right side of these democracy movements that are going to explode and continue to explode.
[00:17:54.432 --> 00:17:57.835]  Right, so they're going to have to find a way to get on the right side of them.
[00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:10.045]  In other words, they have to find the people who are going to emerge as the strongmen, which eventually happens, and they're going to buy them off, just as they had bought off Hosni Mubarak before that.
[00:18:11.085 --> 00:18:14.608]  Just as the US Embassy, according to the London Telegraph report,
[00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:29.094]  Had become aware of the fact that Mubarak was going to be overthrown in 2011, nearly three years before it happened, which gave them the perfect opportunity to put their men in to steer the revolution.
[00:18:29.154 --> 00:18:42.579]  And now, with those new dictator puppets about to take power, certainly in Egypt, and of course Tunisia as well, now we're talking about Bahrain and Libya, there are going to be plenty of
[00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:51.228]  Tasty little lucrative contracts and weapons deals to be done, which is why Cameron is in the region right now doing exactly that.
[00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:56.233]  So in other words, as I wrote in the article,
[00:18:57.443 --> 00:19:04.786]  You know, taxpayers are now labouring under the harshest economic conditions for at least two generations.
[00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:20.414]  But now they're going to use the money that we're supposed to pay them in higher taxes and cut back some public services to buy off whoever takes charge of these globalist-controlled, faux-colour revolutions.
[00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.175]  And on top of that,
[00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:35.014]  The Obama White House is preparing a $4 billion subsidy program which is aimed at keeping food prices low in Egypt.
[00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:38.845]  Oh, how about keeping food prices low in America?
[00:19:39.185 --> 00:19:42.647]  You know, record millions of Americans on food stamps in the United States.
[00:19:43.427 --> 00:19:45.809]  Hypocrisy there, to be sure.
[00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:47.550]  That's it for me.
[00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:55.535]  Alex is going to be back after the break to talk about a myriad of issues including Libya, oil and the global unrest sweeping the planet.
[00:19:55.575 --> 00:19:56.835]  I've been Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:19:57.136 --> 00:19:59.177]  Stay tuned for the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:03.883]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:20:04.484 --> 00:20:04.984]  No kidding!
[00:20:05.164 --> 00:20:09.185]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:20:09.545 --> 00:20:11.985]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:15.506]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:20.567]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:27.509]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[00:20:27.689 --> 00:20:31.570]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.711]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:34.971]  Fit standard mason jars.
[00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:38.333]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.

[00:20:44.395 --> 00:20:45.396]  The original since 1976.
[00:21:01.383 --> 00:21:03.706]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:05.988]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:08.872]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:09.292 --> 00:21:14.058]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:18.603]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.245]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:23.787]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:24.147 --> 00:21:26.709]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:34.655]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:40.248]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:40.368 --> 00:21:42.649]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.689 --> 00:21:46.630]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:47.811]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:49.271]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:50.312]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:00.756]  Gold.
[00:22:01.096 --> 00:22:02.377]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:02.637 --> 00:22:08.740]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:12.723]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:14.984]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:15.024 --> 00:22:17.325]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:25.009]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:25.009 --> 00:22:25.169]  Okay.
[00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:34.455]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:45.982]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:22:46.262 --> 00:22:48.304]  As Good As Gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.324 --> 00:22:50.165]  If you have ever thought about owning gold,

[00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:56.359]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:08.127]  The five main steps to great health are detoxification, an alkaline pH, elimination of infections, optimal hormone levels, and re-nutrification.
[00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:12.449]  When all these factors are brought into play, then your body is supported to create radiant health.
[00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.292]  Of all the nutrients needed by the body, protein plays a dominant role.
[00:23:16.652 --> 00:23:22.096]  The type, quality, and digestibility of that protein plays a key role in how good you feel on a day-to-day basis.
[00:23:22.636 --> 00:23:28.420]  Of all the proteins that nature offers, one is the most digestible and offers the most benefits for the most people.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.021]  It is unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:37.123]  One World Whey is the first ever unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows.
[00:23:37.623 --> 00:23:40.464]  It is easily digested and comes in three delicious flavors.
[00:23:40.884 --> 00:23:47.066]  Whether you want better energy, better blood sugar, more endurance, or clearer thinking, One World Whey is a must for you to try.
[00:23:47.086 --> 00:23:48.246]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:49.286]  That's oneworldwhey.com.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.252]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:24:11.272 --> 00:24:16.001]  Use it only in emergency.
[00:24:18.112 --> 00:24:20.853]  NATO action in the Mideast.
[00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:22.693]  That's the headlines pouring out.
[00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:25.254]  Qaddafi militia open fire on protesters.
[00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:28.715]  Libyans hold mass protest and push to oust leader.
[00:24:29.215 --> 00:24:31.216]  Oil production to shut down completely.
[00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:34.417]  Rebels say they have seized control of the oil fields.
[00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:40.179]  Qaddafi offers $400 per family as rebels close in on capital.
[00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:43.800]  And it continues.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.481]  11 killed as Iraqis protest in day of rage.
[00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:52.759]  Al-Sadr returns after three years in Iran.
[00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:54.680]  Syria rejects nuke probe.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.301]  China's web police block U.S.
[00:24:57.361 --> 00:24:58.322]  Ambassador's name.
[00:24:58.422 --> 00:25:02.504]  Al Jazeera enrages dictators, wins viewers with coverage.
[00:25:02.904 --> 00:25:10.508]  Qaddafi still jamming it over much of the Middle East with a powerful jamming signal, blocking the satellite transmission.
[00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:15.031]  We're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:28.401]  Later in the next hour, because I still want to collect my thoughts on this, because I have a lot of mixed feelings on it, I'm going to obviously talk about the biggest story right now in the United States and in Europe.
[00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:31.263]  There is no doubt it is the biggest story right now.
[00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:43.253]  Quite frankly, the biggest story in the world should be what's happening in the Middle East and North Africa and with the economy and with dollar devaluation going into high gear, going ballistic.
[00:25:44.233 --> 00:25:44.734]  But it's not.
[00:25:46.847 --> 00:25:59.410]  The biggest story right now in the media is Charlie Sheen's radio interview here yesterday and the canceling of the rest of the season for the number one TV show on television, Two and a Half Men.
[00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.751]  Not the number one sitcom, the number one TV show.
[00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:15.174]  And I did not know that Charlie was going to come on air and cover those topics, but I respect the fact that he wanted to come on and
[00:26:17.543 --> 00:26:18.064]  Discuss it.
[00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:58.575]  creator of two-and-a-half men who in the last three weeks has been putting out vanity cards at the end of two-and-a-half men and two other hit shows he has calling charlie soulless uh... saying he's gonna outlive charlie and then leaking things reportedly uh... to the media to basically blame everything on charlie when there wouldn't be a two-and-a-half men show without both chuck lorre and charlie sheen without the creator and then the main engine pulling the whole thing
[00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:05.657]  But I wanted to get Charlie on because I spent time with him and he was completely clean and is still reportedly.
[00:27:06.397 --> 00:27:09.779]  And just to talk about a lot of things in the media that were exaggerated or not true.
[00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:14.580]  But I think we got Charlie on a day when he was fed up and very angry.
[00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:22.183]  And a lot of the things he was doing was joking.
[00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:24.103]  Charlie loves Thomas Jefferson.
[00:27:25.084 --> 00:27:27.565]  Sometimes he gets into this kind of satirical dark humor.
[00:27:31.363 --> 00:27:36.804]  You know, he's seen websites making fun of him, claiming he's a Vatican assassin, so he made that joke.
[00:27:37.244 --> 00:27:39.185]  They're saying he's a warlock, so he made that joke.
[00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:44.766]  He is obviously not a ninja, when he said that.
[00:27:45.366 --> 00:27:48.287]  I'm obviously not a ninja, or any of those other things.
[00:27:49.427 --> 00:27:55.028]  But the media, of course, picked it up like he was being serious and taking it out of context when he was laughing.
[00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:57.469]  But he is high on life.
[00:27:59.355 --> 00:28:03.598]  When I've quit tobacco, many times off and on in my life, I've had a lot of struggles with it.
[00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:06.300]  Only substance I've really had problems with.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.081]  Well, coffee.
[00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:09.522]  I've quit it before, but boy do I love it.
[00:28:09.702 --> 00:28:10.803]  And that's a serious drug.
[00:28:11.804 --> 00:28:12.585]  When I've gone off...
[00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.272]  Nicotine and coffee for a week.
[00:28:16.613 --> 00:28:19.855]  After about a week of feeling terrible, I get crazy with energy.
[00:28:20.116 --> 00:28:21.477]  The whole office has pointed it out.
[00:28:21.497 --> 00:28:26.801]  They're kind of like, you're a nicer guy, Alex, when you're chewing tobacco or smoking cigarettes.
[00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:28.002]  Yes, folks, I chew tobacco.
[00:28:28.062 --> 00:28:29.023]  I'm from Texas, okay?
[00:28:29.063 --> 00:28:29.704]  I'm a redneck.
[00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:31.065]  Let's just get down to it.
[00:28:31.565 --> 00:28:36.309]  I'll put a big old wad of Redman right here, and I swallow the juice.
[00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:38.371]  I got a spittoon.
[00:28:40.988 --> 00:28:43.930]  And I've quit that for a long time, at least a few months.
[00:28:45.971 --> 00:28:51.654]  I think it's better than cigarettes torching my lungs, but it sedates me, really.
[00:28:51.694 --> 00:28:55.857]  And of course, it's been scientifically proven that nicotine does calm.
[00:28:57.538 --> 00:29:09.145]  When you see the wild, crazy rants, and you see me lose weight when I'm working out a lot, and then I tend to gain it back, that's when there'll be months of just craziness on the show, because I'm so alive
[00:29:10.473 --> 00:29:15.576]  And I think that's basically what was happening with Sheen.
[00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:20.898]  He stands by the things he said, and I talked to him a lot last night.
[00:29:20.918 --> 00:29:24.020]  I'm going to talk about it later.
[00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:36.930]  I'm going to talk about it later, but I know Charlie's a good man at heart, and I do apologize to the listeners that were offended by some of the rough language we did to lay some of it out.
[00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:48.796]  But at the same time, you know, Charlie's all about being real, and at the same time, having somebody like Charlie on, it also then gets mainline TV heads to tune into this radio show and find out about reality.
[00:29:51.755 --> 00:29:54.739]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.681 --> 00:29:58.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:05.568]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.888 --> 00:30:06.488]  Number 1.
[00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:09.951]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:10.771]  Number 2.
[00:30:11.092 --> 00:30:15.635]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.975 --> 00:30:16.415]  It's true.
[00:30:16.715 --> 00:30:21.278]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:22.119]  Number 3.
[00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:25.701]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:26.001 --> 00:30:29.704]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.904 --> 00:30:30.445]  Number 4.
[00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:33.067]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:33.447 --> 00:30:36.850]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.351]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:41.854]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:42.075 --> 00:30:46.839]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:51.141]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:52.842]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:53.082 --> 00:30:55.163]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:30:57.945 --> 00:31:04.908]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:31:04.968 --> 00:31:09.030]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:13.873]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:31:13.933 --> 00:31:15.794]  I'm looking for a factory
[00:31:16.614 --> 00:31:19.096]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:31:19.116 --> 00:31:23.840]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:50.464]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:04.538]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:05.879]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:10.303]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:10.503 --> 00:32:16.148]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:16.449 --> 00:32:18.430]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.273]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:21.633 --> 00:32:27.936]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:28.117 --> 00:32:29.938]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:30.338 --> 00:32:35.400]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:35.681 --> 00:32:40.663]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:40.963 --> 00:32:46.166]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:32:46.326 --> 00:32:49.268]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:49.508 --> 00:32:52.473]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:52.513 --> 00:32:53.275]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:33:10.632 --> 00:33:20.397]  I'm going to cover all the important world news, news on the economic front, what's happening with the unions, and of course have our weekly visit with Bob Chapman coming up.
[00:33:20.457 --> 00:33:22.238]  I'll open the phones up later in the next hour.
[00:33:23.359 --> 00:33:32.523]  And in the next hour I will spend 10-15 minutes on the giant Charlie Sheen two-and-a-half men season cancellation controversy.
[00:33:36.966 --> 00:33:42.149]  Charlie's sticking by his guns and has wanted to not do the show for a long time privately.
[00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:43.750]  He's got a lot of other offers.
[00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:52.914]  I mentioned it yesterday, things like HBO, other TV networks, and he's just tired of it.
[00:33:53.095 --> 00:34:03.300]  And then when Chuck Lorre put out all those vanity cards and then continued to attack Charlie, I think he controlled his rage and then it just exploded on my show.
[00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:13.165]  In the riled up state Charlie was in, on fire, how do you say that in Spanish?
[00:34:13.225 --> 00:34:13.786]  En fuego?
[00:34:15.968 --> 00:34:19.111]  That it was a train wreck.
[00:34:19.852 --> 00:34:27.340]  But a very interesting one, and God turns wild things like that into something good.
[00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:42.257]  Because certainly the tens of millions of people an hour hearing that interview now as it's aired in Europe, in Japan, on every network here, every radio station this morning.
[00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:46.391]  I was hearing from staff and crew who listen to different local stations.
[00:34:46.411 --> 00:34:47.712]  They were all talking about it.
[00:34:48.073 --> 00:34:52.416]  They were all talking about InfoWars.com where folks could hear the whole interview.
[00:34:52.436 --> 00:34:54.277]  I was just on MSNBC.
[00:34:54.317 --> 00:34:59.721]  That's why Paul sat in in the first 20 minutes and I was able to plug InfoWars.com several times.
[00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:04.444]  And so basically all the mind-numbed mainline TV watchers
[00:35:05.345 --> 00:35:12.831]  The fluoride heads, as Charlie calls them, that aren't awake, they will now be able to tune into this radio show and find this broadcast.
[00:35:12.871 --> 00:35:19.356]  And if you are a new listener to this show, you need to know that there is poison being put in the water.
[00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:22.599]  It's called sodium fluoride, and more and more cities are removing it.
[00:35:22.699 --> 00:35:30.445]  Class action suits have been filed, and top EPA scientists are on record documenting that it causes a seven-fold increase in cancer in men.
[00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:34.548]  A three-fold increase in bone cancer alone, just in that one area.
[00:35:34.568 --> 00:35:37.010]  There's many other cancers and increases in women.
[00:35:37.811 --> 00:35:39.112]  You need to know that
[00:35:41.121 --> 00:35:52.509]  There is a global government forming that has engineered this financial collapse to create a post-industrial world where you're so bankrupt and so broke that you can go under social engineering government control.
[00:35:53.289 --> 00:36:07.879]  You need to know that the entire Middle Eastern situation was triggered by the globalists, by the George Soros-type crowd to destabilize the Middle East and then the rest of the world and use that as a smoke screen to blame the crises.
[00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:13.916]  that are happening in the banking system on what's happening in the Middle East.
[00:36:14.436 --> 00:36:20.040]  When what's happening in the Middle East, the main foundation of it is dollar devaluation.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.704]  The world uses dollars to buy oil, to buy fuel.
[00:36:26.065 --> 00:36:32.970]  The currencies are all based on the dollar, even though you have, you know, the euro, you have other currencies still.
[00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:37.614]  They're all pegged to the dollar and we're moving towards a point where the dollar
[00:36:38.314 --> 00:36:42.315]  We'll no longer be the world reserve currency and we've been deindustrialized.
[00:36:42.355 --> 00:36:43.715]  We've had our economy shut down.
[00:36:44.175 --> 00:36:51.976]  We've had intrusive regulations put in place where we can't compete with China and India and Mexico and scores of other third world nations.
[00:36:52.576 --> 00:36:54.917]  And that's why your standard of living is dropping.
[00:36:55.117 --> 00:37:07.239]  And where it's fine to watch a football game or two and a half men, but you really should sometimes try turning off the television and reading a book or researching history and getting involved in reality.
[00:37:08.658 --> 00:37:14.282]  As I said last Sunday, there is no rest when you're involved in reality.
[00:37:15.403 --> 00:37:22.329]  And we are so focused on reality and what's really happening in the real world, but sometimes we go into the matrix.
[00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:28.033]  And by going into the matrix, into the mainstream system, we're able to reach new people.
[00:37:28.994 --> 00:37:29.334]  And overall,
[00:37:32.193 --> 00:37:48.564]  I just hope that everything turns out well for Charlie and that he stays clean and that everybody prays for him because I know him as a multifaceted person, a very loving person, and I was not expecting just the over-the-top
[00:37:49.424 --> 00:38:03.006]  Unleashed situation we saw yesterday and certainly it was very interesting and certainly it's the biggest news story right now in the country and in much of the world showing where people's focus is.
[00:38:04.423 --> 00:38:07.025]  It's on television shows.
[00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:30.622]  But by this show being the place where that was discussed, can you see how now people will tune into this broadcast and they'll understand that things like abortion aren't some wonderful civil right, but that it's part of a eugenics program to reduce population, and that our own government has been funding China and others in forced abortions and infanticide.
[00:38:33.101 --> 00:38:50.918]  And, I mean, I'm almost tempted, but I'm exhausted from last night and this morning, all the countless radio, TV, newspaper interviews I've done to, of this morning, be able to codify a lot of the important bedrock issues that we cover here every single day.
[00:38:50.958 --> 00:38:55.302]  But because we have a lot of mainstream TV watchers, guys, I meant to cover it Monday.
[00:38:55.342 --> 00:38:56.603]  I meant to cover it yesterday.
[00:38:57.418 --> 00:39:15.510]  Will you pull me the mainstream news article about the new light bulbs that are going to have computer signals going through them, basically programming and interfacing with your computer, and the other patent number article dealing with the admission that not only does the flicker rate on TV
[00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:42.481]  Put you into a mesmerized, hypnotized, highly suggestible state, but that not only propaganda messages can be on what's being said on TV, that's one level of propaganda, and the flicker rate puts you in that suggestible state, but that actual data that they can put signals in the flicker that can make you sick, make you angry, make you happy, this is mind control.
[00:39:43.342 --> 00:39:46.263]  You know, a hundred years ago, how would a hypnotist
[00:39:48.837 --> 00:39:49.497]  Hypnotize you.
[00:39:49.517 --> 00:39:53.760]  You know, they do it by having you watch a flashing light or a watch.
[00:39:54.081 --> 00:39:57.323]  Well, this is 21st century versions of that.
[00:39:58.143 --> 00:39:59.124]  Watch the watch.
[00:39:59.304 --> 00:40:00.045]  Listen to me.
[00:40:00.505 --> 00:40:01.365]  Do what I say.
[00:40:01.385 --> 00:40:12.313]  You know, for those of you out there tuning in for the first time, who are hearing this and laughing at what I'm saying, let me just give you a few examples of what I'm talking about.
[00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:16.756]  Then I'll get into what's happening in North Africa and the Middle East and what's happening with the economy.
[00:40:18.172 --> 00:40:43.911]  uh... here is yeah this is good but there's there's one other there's the actual article on this patent uh... there's one more article i need guys yeah thank you for the actual article about the patent uh... but uh... here's the patent it's patent six dash five zero six dash one four eight and to the u.s.
[00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:44.932]  patent office
[00:40:46.378 --> 00:40:47.278]  uh... current u.s.
[00:40:47.358 --> 00:40:53.640]  class current international class and it's got its coded uh... larger number their u.s.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:41:13.106]  patent document uh... this is uh... from january fourteenth two thousand three and this is just one of countless patent documents uh... that are out there dealing with this and it's titled nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from monitors
[00:41:13.766 --> 00:41:27.197]  Psychological effects have been observed in human subjects in response to stimulation of the skin with weak magnetic fields that are pulsed with a certain frequency near the 1.5 Hertz to 2.4 Hertz such as to excite a sensory resonance.
[00:41:27.717 --> 00:41:37.205]  Many computer monitors and TV tubes when displaying pulsed images emit pulse electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation.
[00:41:38.447 --> 00:41:48.174]  It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set for the latter.
[00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:51.437]  The image pulsing may be embedded in the program.
[00:41:52.648 --> 00:41:53.228]  Material.
[00:41:53.529 --> 00:41:55.950]  Did you hear that on the actual video that they're feeding into it?
[00:41:56.611 --> 00:41:57.431]  The original signal.
[00:41:57.711 --> 00:42:03.956]  Or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either with an RF signal or as a video signal.
[00:42:04.316 --> 00:42:11.040]  The image displayed on the computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program for certain monitors.
[00:42:11.381 --> 00:42:22.488]  Pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the display images are pulsed with a subliminal intensity.
[00:42:23.008 --> 00:42:24.629]  That means you don't know about it or notice it.
[00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.391]  And here's an article about it.
[00:42:27.472 --> 00:42:27.892]  Patent.
[00:42:27.932 --> 00:42:30.133]  Nervous system manipulation from TV monitors.
[00:42:30.194 --> 00:42:33.116]  Now, we've had Dr. Nick Begich, whose brother is also a U.S.
[00:42:33.136 --> 00:42:36.998]  Senator, his father a former congressman, who was murdered.
[00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:47.403]  But, side issue, Dr. Nick Begich has always tried to explain to me, Alex, yes, they admit they want to put lithium in the water to calm us, and now that's mainstream news.
[00:42:47.544 --> 00:42:57.668]  Even Fox News reports how great it's going to be to have lithium in our water, and how Japan's moving to do it, and how sodium fluoride also brain damages you and calms you and makes you servile and lowers your IQ.
[00:42:57.728 --> 00:43:03.071]  But he said, that's child's play compared to the thousands of patents, most of them U.S.
[00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:03.491]  government,
[00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:23.940]  Dealing with electromagnetics through cell towers, through TV towers, through cell phones, where they can modulate and make you throw up, make you become giddy, make you have an aphrodisiac, make you die, make you have a heart attack.
[00:43:24.918 --> 00:43:35.022]  And I remember close to ten years ago the Baltimore Sun, somebody ought to research it and pull it up, I forget the exact headline, but it was DARPA looking at ways to calm the public during riots.
[00:43:35.402 --> 00:43:39.863]  They're not just looking at sound cannons or microwave guns, now those are rolled out at the Tea Party as you've seen.
[00:43:40.424 --> 00:43:44.185]  I was kooky to cover it ten years ago, now it's mainstream news and it's being used against us.
[00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:52.128]  But they said they're also getting ready to deploy towers that put off a magnetic resonance that will calm people during emergencies.
[00:43:53.427 --> 00:43:54.068]  So we're here, 2011.
[00:43:55.049 --> 00:44:05.959]  Now, you read this patent, and I spent an hour or so trying to read just one of these patents where they describe how it's all been tested and how it works.
[00:44:06.997 --> 00:44:10.298]  And you better believe, shopping malls, it's come out in the news.
[00:44:10.498 --> 00:44:12.918]  There's so much proof, it's like an ocean of proof.
[00:44:14.039 --> 00:44:25.381]  You've seen the news reports about how shopping malls put out, quote, subliminal audio at such a low level, your conscious brain doesn't, you know, really, the conscious part of your mind doesn't pick it up.
[00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:35.884]  But it's soothing statements and soothing frequencies and, you know, to make you feel good and want to buy more junk.
[00:44:37.868 --> 00:44:41.861]  It's famous for the casinos giving people free drinks and pumping in oxygen.
[00:44:43.761 --> 00:44:47.404]  And keeping it cold so you don't get sleepy.
[00:44:47.445 --> 00:44:49.967]  Ever been in a warm room and it makes you get sleepy?
[00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:53.390]  I mean, that stuff the gangsters were doing 50, 60 years ago.
[00:44:53.770 --> 00:45:00.336]  Or if you go back to the 1940s, they teach this in, you know, RTF in your first course about subliminal messaging.
[00:45:00.736 --> 00:45:04.220]  And you tell the public there's subliminal messaging, they laugh at you because they've been told it doesn't exist.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.081]  But then you go take RTF, they admit it.
[00:45:06.602 --> 00:45:10.005]  Some of the first were in the 40s where they would show a desert.
[00:45:11.206 --> 00:45:11.846]  I don't
[00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:54.798]  popcorn and saying you're hungry you're hungry if you're not really hungry and you consciously see an ad for popcorn you may not want it but your bestial kind of uh... you know lower brain centers of breathing and procreation and eating and things like that it's like i'm always hungry like a dog will eat and eat and eat until it throws up and then it'll go after the throw up so it's kind of hitting that lower area well you're hungry you're not really hungry but hungry
[00:45:55.598 --> 00:45:56.238]  I'm hungry!
[00:45:56.518 --> 00:46:00.959]  And they put additives in the food, uh, which, uh, I mean, they admit MSG does that.
[00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:04.660]  It blocks the area of the brain, knowing that you've already gotten enough food.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.622]  It blocks the brain picking up on how much insulin is there, so you go eat more, more, more, more, more.
[00:46:10.082 --> 00:46:11.042]  Aspartame does that.
[00:46:11.062 --> 00:46:14.923]  You ever seen how many super obese people always have a Diet Coke in their hand?
[00:46:15.243 --> 00:46:16.143]  Or a Diet Pepsi?
[00:46:16.723 --> 00:46:18.324]  And it's also very toxic and addicting.
[00:46:18.344 --> 00:46:22.105]  So this is all pharmakia designed and hidden, but now they're moving
[00:46:23.271 --> 00:46:24.471]  To the pulsing lights.
[00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:27.853]  Now, you know, we've seen continuity of agenda.
[00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:36.836]  Australia, England, the EU, many Arab nations, many Eastern European nations, Latin American nations.
[00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:42.484]  Under international push from the UN, first they do something that sounds reasonable.
[00:46:42.584 --> 00:46:44.925]  Oh, let's start banning smoking outdoors worldwide.
[00:46:45.165 --> 00:46:47.006]  And they have cities, counties, states do it.
[00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:49.067]  But it's all really UN run.
[00:46:49.348 --> 00:46:50.248]  It's called agenda 21.
[00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:54.891]  Now let's have a global move in all these countries to ban high flush toilets.
[00:46:56.032 --> 00:46:59.273]  So they set the precedent that they set the rules, because they have the moral authority.
[00:46:59.293 --> 00:47:06.458]  Then, oh, you've got to put in these expensive light bulbs that if one breaks or cracks, that you've got to
[00:47:07.898 --> 00:47:12.161]  Call a hazmat team, open the windows, and leave your house for three days.
[00:47:12.842 --> 00:47:13.522]  And that's admitted.
[00:47:15.043 --> 00:47:22.549]  And then we start seeing all these major medical reports about people getting headaches, people getting sick, young people starting to have strokes.
[00:47:22.669 --> 00:47:24.410]  You've seen that in the news.
[00:47:26.011 --> 00:47:35.158]  In Japan, six, seven years ago, they had a Pokemon episode, and tens of thousands of children went into convulsions, and they admitted, yes, we did a test with the flashing on the screen.
[00:47:35.498 --> 00:47:36.819]  Sorry, we've removed it.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:43.523]  Tens of thousands of kids, one episode, all over Japan, flopping around, foaming at the mouth.
[00:47:44.084 --> 00:47:44.924]  I mean, full on.
[00:47:44.944 --> 00:47:46.005]  Some of them broke bones.
[00:47:46.045 --> 00:47:49.567]  Some of them dislocated because they were having violent seizures.
[00:47:51.028 --> 00:47:52.188]  Now, this is all on record.
[00:47:52.228 --> 00:47:54.130]  Everything I've said, you can go look up and pull up.
[00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.392]  Now, remember a few months ago, we started covering this.
[00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:02.953]  My bright idea, light bulbs can be used to transmit data.
[00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:11.900]  With a device you can buy at any high street, Professor Harold Haas is perfecting a revolutionary method of controlling digital information with the flick of a switch.
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:17.684]  Now, this article came out last year.
[00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:24.150]  Now, since then, I have another article that just came out a few months ago.
[00:48:25.649 --> 00:48:27.990]  And this is out of the Associated Press.
[00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.811]  Ceiling lights in Minnesota send coded internet data.
[00:48:31.851 --> 00:48:32.791]  Where are they testing it?
[00:48:33.211 --> 00:48:35.092]  In state government buildings.
[00:48:36.032 --> 00:48:40.654]  Now again, by law, within a year and a half, you're not going to be able to buy phosphorescence.
[00:48:40.714 --> 00:48:43.455]  It's already phasing in with the higher wattage bulbs this year.
[00:48:44.315 --> 00:48:54.021]  Can't have the phosphorescent, that good yellow, white light that mimics the sun, that mimics firelight, candlelight that our eyes are designed for.
[00:48:54.682 --> 00:48:56.363]  No, you've got to have the fluorescent.
[00:48:57.384 --> 00:48:59.825]  And I've got the articles here about all the sicknesses they're causing.
[00:48:59.865 --> 00:49:00.806]  This is now confirmed.
[00:49:01.766 --> 00:49:04.608]  Five, six years ago, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, shut up, it's good for you.
[00:49:05.229 --> 00:49:08.451]  All these people complaining, doctors doing studies saying something's going on here.
[00:49:09.725 --> 00:49:16.890]  Now the federal government's coming in with grants at the police stations and all over the nation, not just Minnesota.
[00:49:17.271 --> 00:49:24.336]  Oh, we have special fluorescent light bulbs that are going to communicate wirelessly with your computer.
[00:49:24.376 --> 00:49:28.379]  So they can now wirelessly program the computer how they want, but that's only one issue.
[00:49:28.919 --> 00:49:29.880]  They're flashing.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:36.265]  And when you read the patents on these flashing lights that transmit data, it's actually a cover story.
[00:49:39.482 --> 00:49:50.519]  Just like the globalists in the Telecommunications Act of 96 said by 2001, October 1st, 2001, all cell phones must have a safety tracker chip in them where we can turn your phone on in an emergency to save you.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.301]  Now we learn it's to spy on us.
[00:49:53.422 --> 00:50:02.969]  So it's always dual use and it turns out that these light bulbs are at the same frequency modulation as these patents on mind control.
[00:50:03.469 --> 00:50:06.351]  So they're putting in mind control flashing lights.
[00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:07.052]  This is a fact!
[00:50:07.792 --> 00:50:13.957]  All over the country, in the first place is the government workers, police, social workers, health department people.
[00:50:14.915 --> 00:50:23.058]  You're going to let them do this, and they're going to put you in a trance, and they're going to have the big Homeland Security telescreens everywhere telling you to watch your neighbors.
[00:50:23.399 --> 00:50:26.280]  Even if you try to turn the TV off, they're not going to let you get away.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.281]  They're going to have their hypnotism machines beaming.
[00:50:30.822 --> 00:50:33.203]  Guaranteed, they've already been caught testing it over and over again.
[00:50:33.623 --> 00:50:35.504]  Janet Napolitano, you ever watch your kids?
[00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:39.572]  Watch TV and they're drooling and you can't even get their attention?
[00:50:40.373 --> 00:50:40.653]  Hey!
[00:50:40.973 --> 00:50:41.454]  Talk to me!
[00:50:41.514 --> 00:50:42.194]  I'm talking to you!
[00:50:42.494 --> 00:50:45.977]  Imagine people at Walmart checkout lines and at shopping malls and town squares.
[00:50:46.297 --> 00:50:47.598]  Big jumbo screens going in.
[00:50:48.359 --> 00:50:52.862]  Not just with a message of spy on your neighbor, but through the message, through the video, through the light.
[00:50:53.062 --> 00:50:53.983]  They can do it three ways.
[00:50:54.323 --> 00:50:57.025]  Pumping you with stuff that they can kill you.
[00:50:57.345 --> 00:50:59.527]  They can make you have a heart attack with this if they want.
[00:50:59.667 --> 00:51:01.028]  They're putting in kill screens!
[00:51:03.564 --> 00:51:04.704]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.784 --> 00:51:06.765]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:07.305 --> 00:51:08.905]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:09.205 --> 00:51:16.326]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:20.767]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.807 --> 00:51:31.109]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:31.289 --> 00:51:32.870]  Under any circumstance.
[00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:39.833]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:40.153 --> 00:51:40.814]  But listen up.
[00:51:40.834 --> 00:51:47.037]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:47.097 --> 00:51:48.918]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:48.938 --> 00:51:51.019]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:51.579]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:53.440]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:53.880]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.160]  Right now.
[00:52:02.398 --> 00:52:06.022]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.422 --> 00:52:09.406]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.646 --> 00:52:14.451]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:20.698]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.838 --> 00:52:23.081]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.621 --> 00:52:23.901]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.921 --> 00:52:24.161]  Bernanke?
[00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:24.762]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.782 --> 00:52:25.862]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:26.202 --> 00:52:28.623]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.509 --> 00:52:46.434]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:52:46.894 --> 00:52:49.397]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[00:54:02.258 --> 00:54:07.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.340]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:11.921 --> 00:54:17.643]  If you are a new listener, I'm begging you to not believe a word I'm saying.
[00:54:18.763 --> 00:54:22.584]  There are subliminal messages all over mainstream television.
[00:54:24.363 --> 00:54:36.871]  There are subliminal messages, but there's not just messages when you're watching a cop drama, and the bad guy's always some patriot who loves the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and on the side, he's trying to nerve gas people.
[00:54:37.471 --> 00:54:39.612]  Or homeschoolers are abusing their children.
[00:54:39.652 --> 00:54:43.155]  How many fictional shows do you see where they demonize gun owners?
[00:54:45.016 --> 00:54:47.617]  That's the overt propaganda and conditioning.
[00:54:48.278 --> 00:54:53.081]  But now the system, and there are literally thousands of patents, I just read to you one of these,
[00:54:54.659 --> 00:55:12.945]  Or they admit that the flickering through light bulbs, the fluorescent light bulbs, the flickering through the television screens, especially the high-def TV, can have overlaid in the audio, video signal, three different ways, I just read earlier,
[00:55:14.588 --> 00:55:18.091]  to literally cause physiological responses.
[00:55:18.492 --> 00:55:21.054]  Here's an ABC News article on a similar area.
[00:55:21.074 --> 00:55:22.716]  I mean, this is just a few days ago.
[00:55:22.736 --> 00:55:24.918]  I mean, I see this stuff every day without looking.
[00:55:24.938 --> 00:55:26.359]  I read the medical journals.
[00:55:37.486 --> 00:55:45.135]  After a few minutes of using a cell phone in the area through your skull, the brain goes up by one degree.
[00:55:46.998 --> 00:55:48.359]  It actually heats your brain up.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.662]  Now there's an urban legend where they claim it can
[00:55:51.892 --> 00:55:56.275]  You know, basically boil a hard-boiled egg.
[00:55:56.315 --> 00:55:56.995]  That's not true.
[00:55:57.556 --> 00:56:02.459]  So see, then there's hoaxes out there that discredit the fact that it does do that.
[00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:21.091]  Research used PET scans to measure brain activity in 47 participants when they had cell phones held to their ears in both off and on but muted positions and found that exposure to in-use cell phone for more than 50 minutes increased brain activity by about 7% in the regions close to the antenna.
[00:56:23.067 --> 00:56:36.777]  And it goes on that the wavelength, it's a microwave, it's a microwave relay system, that the microwave signal actually vibrates at a frequency that breaks your DNA.
[00:56:36.797 --> 00:56:40.600]  And that's why there's so much evidence linking cell phones to brain cancer.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.761]  But still, I use them.
[00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:43.881]  Because it's so incredibly convenient.
[00:56:44.522 --> 00:56:52.624]  For years, I almost never used them, but in emergencies, I would keep one locked in my car, in my desk, and when I needed it, or on a trip, when I absolutely had to have it, I did.
[00:56:53.404 --> 00:56:54.985]  Now, I've just completely succumbed to it.
[00:56:55.805 --> 00:56:58.326]  I don't watch a lot of television in the mind control system there.
[00:56:58.646 --> 00:56:59.946]  I mean, I'm not on a high horse here.
[00:57:00.006 --> 00:57:02.687]  I know how they just... It's kind of like animals.
[00:57:02.767 --> 00:57:07.389]  If you went and poisoned a well, went and poisoned a water trough,
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:13.821]  But cows and deer, you know, a stock tank, the cows wouldn't know.
[00:57:15.001 --> 00:57:17.122]  There's a lot of poisons that, you know, you don't even taste.
[00:57:17.702 --> 00:57:22.723]  And they would just come up and drink it, and the deer would come up and drink it, and the foxes would come up and drink it, and they'd all go off and die.
[00:57:23.463 --> 00:57:32.804]  And they're stupid animals, so even though they would see other animals dying around them, they would still go and drink from it.
[00:57:33.785 --> 00:57:35.405]  And in a way, I guess I'm a dumb animal.
[00:57:36.698 --> 00:57:43.327]  I mean, that's the point I'm making here, is that we know this is going on, but it's been just introduced to us like it's in the environment.
[00:57:43.347 --> 00:57:52.359]  Because humans are designed to go pick a strawberry and eat it, or go pick a banana and eat it, or, you know, go with a bow and arrow and shoot a deer to eat it.
[00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:57.086]  And we just trust that this is our environment, and we're sold the cell phones.
[00:57:57.746 --> 00:57:59.147]  In fact, I've got one in my pocket right here.
[00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:00.327]  Shouldn't be.
[00:58:00.767 --> 00:58:03.168]  It's receiving and transmitting all the time, getting pinged.
[00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:07.130]  You ever had a cell phone sitting by electronic equipment and you heard, eeeh, eeeh?
[00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:10.051]  Because that's because the tower's pinging it with its GPS.
[00:58:10.412 --> 00:58:12.252]  Government's keeping tabs on you, tracking you.
[00:58:12.573 --> 00:58:15.934]  But I use this device to go into the Matrix and try to reach people.
[00:58:15.974 --> 00:58:20.116]  We have an iPhone app, knowing people are going to be on these regardless of what we do or say.
[00:58:20.556 --> 00:58:21.977]  And so we reach into the Matrix.
[00:58:22.537 --> 00:58:29.019]  Through the iPhone app, just like we reach into the Matrix through Charlie Sheen, to the general public, to try to wake them up to what's happening.
[00:58:30.179 --> 00:58:40.242]  So, I'm gonna be covering this a lot more in the future, because they're rolling out these signals on television, through the light bulbs, that's why they're making it the law, you gotta take these new light bulbs.
[00:58:44.943 --> 00:58:48.904]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:53.232 --> 00:58:54.612]  You're subject to other police action.
[00:58:55.393 --> 00:58:56.313]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:56.653 --> 00:59:00.154]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:00.514 --> 00:59:02.794]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:02.814 --> 00:59:08.255]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:08.676 --> 00:59:14.917]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:15.337 --> 00:59:20.882]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:21.322 --> 00:59:25.005]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:59:25.505 --> 00:59:29.489]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:35.313]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:35.734 --> 00:59:38.716]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:39.297 --> 00:59:40.718]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:41.278 --> 00:59:41.699]  It's here.

[00:59:56.656 --> 00:59:59.439]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:10.224]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.845 --> 01:00:11.686]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:13.407]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.987 --> 01:00:17.590]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:22.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.156 --> 01:00:35.144]  We're now into our number two, our once a week visit with Bob Chapman's coming up in the
[01:00:36.854 --> 01:00:55.046]  Third hour, I will try to address, I've got so many different conflicting thoughts in my mind that, wild, off the charts, off the rails, over the top interview with Charlie Sheen yesterday, that is the biggest news story in the United States.
[01:00:56.258 --> 01:00:57.218]  And I'm exhausted.
[01:00:57.318 --> 01:01:00.119]  I did a whole bunch of TV, radio, newspaper interviews last night.
[01:01:00.819 --> 01:01:05.860]  I've already been on MSNBC today, and I'm on a whole bunch of stuff coming up tonight.
[01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:14.182]  And obviously we'll be able to inject InfoWars.com into the discussion when I'm on those broadcasts.
[01:01:14.603 --> 01:01:17.523]  And people will come here and find the larger picture.
[01:01:17.563 --> 01:01:18.504]  It's kind of the red pill.
[01:01:19.184 --> 01:01:20.524]  Thanks to Charlie Sheen.
[01:01:20.724 --> 01:01:24.225]  I was going to get Charlie on to talk about how
[01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:27.080]  Great it is that he's off drugs.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.542]  And to talk about his passion for life, and he did get into some other issues.
[01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:36.345]  And I think the key point here is Chuck Lorre is the one that started attacking him first.
[01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.487]  And so there's been some developments there.
[01:01:39.527 --> 01:01:47.332]  In fact, Chuck Lorre has now said that he is not going to do vanity cards anymore.
[01:01:47.392 --> 01:01:50.574]  The ones that he's been putting at the end of the show attacking Charlie Sheen.
[01:01:50.594 --> 01:01:53.396]  That's just incredible with Charlie keeping his mouth shut.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.281]  Well, Chuck did that.
[01:01:55.822 --> 01:01:58.706]  And so, in fact, I sent it to you guys, but I didn't see it in the stack.
[01:01:58.726 --> 01:02:02.791]  Will you just search the term Chuck Lorre is suspending vanity cards?
[01:02:03.592 --> 01:02:08.719]  People are like, what does that matter with the world collapsing and the whole New World Order situation taking place?
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.361]  Well, we're covering that.
[01:02:11.418 --> 01:02:24.943]  But when you have a situation where you've got the number one story in the country, and they're going to try to bring Charlie down with this, we should point out that Chuck Lorre started the attack on him and ask why he did that.
[01:02:25.944 --> 01:02:26.904]  I don't know Chuck Lorre.
[01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:28.104]  I don't like getting in the middle of it.
[01:02:28.204 --> 01:02:30.025]  I didn't know we were going to go that direction in the interview.
[01:02:30.145 --> 01:02:31.546]  I want Charlie's show to continue.
[01:02:32.546 --> 01:02:37.128]  You're talking about over a billion dollars in syndication just left in this season and next season.
[01:02:38.308 --> 01:02:39.249]  that he's scheduled to do.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:54.163]  I was just excited to get Charlie on to say, hey, great job not using drugs, great job being clean.
[01:02:54.903 --> 01:02:57.025]  And some of the things the media had said about him that weren't true.
[01:02:57.065 --> 01:03:02.428]  And by the time I got him on to do the interview, he's just like, I know we talked about that, but let's kind of cover these areas.
[01:03:02.448 --> 01:03:08.172]  And I was like, okay, but I don't, all I'm saying is I care about Charlie and he has a lot of passion.
[01:03:08.912 --> 01:03:16.958]  And I just think he was trying to be absolutely off the chart yesterday to let folks know, I don't care what you think about me.
[01:03:18.994 --> 01:03:20.576]  And he feels like he's come out of a cult.
[01:03:21.778 --> 01:03:23.079]  Talking about AA and...
[01:03:25.307 --> 01:03:26.908]  I don't really know a lot about AA.
[01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:36.653]  I know that some of the spin-off groups of it and some of the drug addiction groups out there over the years do end up, you know, basically being called cults.
[01:03:37.574 --> 01:03:39.255]  I mean, what do people say about Scientology?
[01:03:39.895 --> 01:03:42.877]  He made the Scientologist comment about how they're the Church of the Martian.
[01:03:44.377 --> 01:03:47.999]  And, man, I tell you, I mean, he just went wild.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.441]  And, of course, I talked to him last night.
[01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:52.482]  That was a joke about Thomas Jefferson.
[01:03:54.224 --> 01:04:01.808]  I mean, I, you know, I admire Thomas Jefferson immensely and our other founders.
[01:04:01.848 --> 01:04:04.510]  And I know Charlie's into the Constitution of the Bill of Rights.
[01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:08.932]  I think we happen to catch Charlie at a particularly explosive point.
[01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:13.474]  And I just want all this to end well.
[01:04:17.918 --> 01:04:30.510]  But it is very strange to be involved in something that is as big as OJ Simpson at the height of that hysteria.
[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:32.111]  I mean, this is that big.
[01:04:32.972 --> 01:04:37.917]  I've been talking to national media and they say this is probably one of the biggest things to ever happen in the whole tabloid world.
[01:04:38.297 --> 01:04:39.939]  And we're sitting here right in the middle of it.
[01:04:41.055 --> 01:04:48.363]  No weapon formed against us will prosper and we're going to now be able to lead people to all this information about the globalists.
[01:04:49.464 --> 01:04:53.229]  So I guess God's working some way through all of this.
[01:04:53.729 --> 01:04:56.532]  I just want Charlie to survive and prosper.
[01:04:57.233 --> 01:04:58.635]  And for everybody else too as well.
[01:04:59.215 --> 01:04:59.796]  But it was wild.
[01:05:01.428 --> 01:05:03.010]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:05.872]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:53.618 --> 01:05:53.918]  Thank you!
[01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:05.173]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.493 --> 01:06:06.093]  Number 1.
[01:06:06.413 --> 01:06:09.555]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.836 --> 01:06:10.376]  Number 2.
[01:06:10.696 --> 01:06:15.259]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.579 --> 01:06:16.020]  It's true.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.883]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.203 --> 01:06:21.743]  Number 3.
[01:06:22.023 --> 01:06:25.305]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:29.308]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.508 --> 01:06:30.069]  Number 4.
[01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:32.672]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:36.456]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.756 --> 01:06:36.956]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.537 --> 01:06:41.461]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.682 --> 01:06:46.447]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.727 --> 01:06:50.752]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.912 --> 01:06:52.474]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.694 --> 01:06:54.776]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:54.957 --> 01:06:57.279]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:04.403]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:04.683 --> 01:07:05.765]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:05.985 --> 01:07:10.151]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:10.391 --> 01:07:16.039]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:16.339 --> 01:07:18.282]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:18.462 --> 01:07:21.203]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:21.503 --> 01:07:27.806]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:07:27.986 --> 01:07:29.807]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:07:30.207 --> 01:07:35.269]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:40.531]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:45.992]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:07:46.193 --> 01:07:49.153]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:07:49.394 --> 01:07:52.335]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:52.395 --> 01:07:53.155]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:08:01.437 --> 01:08:06.366]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.726 --> 01:08:09.010]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.668]  Alright, I'm going to get into the geopolitical news.
[01:08:21.788 --> 01:08:26.309]  Also another runaway general army deploys PSYOPs on U.S.
[01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:26.810]  Senators.
[01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.010]  That's Rolling Stone.
[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:32.711]  We're going to get into what's happening with the London Stock Exchange hit by a technical glitch.
[01:08:33.892 --> 01:08:39.534]  Yeah, technical manipulation like that thousand point drop we saw on the New York Stock Exchange last year.
[01:08:40.874 --> 01:08:46.716]  That little inside job operation.
[01:08:49.161 --> 01:09:00.720]  that we saw last year but just briefly saying something else about the Charlie Sheen situation that exploded internationally on this broadcast yesterday
[01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:03.661]  It was explosive.
[01:09:03.941 --> 01:09:06.282]  It was out of the blue.
[01:09:06.322 --> 01:09:08.963]  I didn't know we were going to get into some of those areas.
[01:09:09.023 --> 01:09:12.065]  Charlie was pretty wound up, but I talked to him last night.
[01:09:12.105 --> 01:09:15.326]  He's totally clean, and I think he's just completely high on life.
[01:09:15.346 --> 01:09:19.848]  Can you imagine coming off seven months of intense drinking and other destructive things?
[01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:22.109]  I mean, the guy is, is
[01:09:26.482 --> 01:09:32.985]  The guy is in a very interesting place, and I appreciate listeners praying for him, but it's almost like the Drudge Report was put on the map.
[01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:38.748]  We've already on the map big time, but he was put on the map when he broke the Monica Lewinsky story.
[01:09:39.768 --> 01:09:43.270]  And people could say, well, what does it matter what Bill Clinton's doing?
[01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:45.571]  You know, the point is something that big
[01:09:46.391 --> 01:09:50.012]  Can take a media operation and send it to a whole other level.
[01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:52.153]  And that clearly is happening right now.
[01:09:53.093 --> 01:09:54.954]  So I think a lot of good is going to come out of this.
[01:09:55.074 --> 01:10:00.415]  I hope Charlie doesn't lose his show, though I know for years he hasn't wanted to continue it and has a lot of other big offers.
[01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:03.756]  I just want him to stay clean, get himself completely together.
[01:10:03.776 --> 01:10:12.319]  And he's together right now, but on fire and wild and over the top on the show, which I haven't seen him be like that in person.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:26.016]  I just think he threw the gauntlet down to the world and feels like he's breaking out of a gilded cage I think is the best way to put it but I do for some that were offended by some of the things he said
[01:10:27.754 --> 01:10:32.776]  Obviously I apologize for that because we Charlie's been on the show probably ten times.
[01:10:32.816 --> 01:10:49.061]  I haven't counted it, but close to ten Previously and I never had any of that happen but you know at the same time it's live dynamic radio with a guy who has Been through a lot
[01:10:50.848 --> 01:10:52.649]  You wouldn't believe his text messaging me over here.
[01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:54.270]  They're just just just pouring in.
[01:10:54.310 --> 01:11:16.240]  It's completely wild what's going on and and and you know the problem with having a gut instinct that I knew would be big getting Charlie on and I thought we'd talk about hey he's clean and he's living life and Major League Three and let him dispel some of the false things that have been said and it just went a completely different direction and it freaks me out.
[01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:18.241]  I don't want
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.104]  That show to be cancelled for the year or cancelled period.
[01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:25.490]  But I mean, Charlie is the guy that makes the show, so it's his life.
[01:11:26.411 --> 01:11:28.374]  And I understand why he's mad at Chuck Lorre.
[01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:35.735]  Putting out vanity cards, text essays at the end of the show attacking him.
[01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.557]  When Charlie was not saying anything about Chuck Lorre.
[01:11:39.197 --> 01:11:41.659]  And I think that's the biggest issue in the media that's wrong.
[01:11:42.139 --> 01:11:48.264]  And it shows how Hollywood always makes it about the stars being wrong and not the behind-the-scenes stuff that goes on.
[01:11:48.544 --> 01:11:51.026]  I think that's where the rage you saw came from.
[01:11:51.066 --> 01:11:52.567]  But I said I'm getting that later in the hour.
[01:11:53.548 --> 01:11:57.871]  It's just obviously right now I'm almost shell-shocked by all this because I
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.700]  I don't even know what to say.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.121]  I mean, I'm just a little speechless.
[01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:09.322]  I was speechless during the interview.
[01:12:09.362 --> 01:12:10.563]  It was off the charts.
[01:12:12.403 --> 01:12:18.886]  And it's really almost creepy to be getting this much attention right now.
[01:12:19.686 --> 01:12:23.787]  I mean, there's TV and radio networks all over the world tuned into this broadcast right now.
[01:12:24.287 --> 01:12:28.749]  And I'm here saying, wow, what should I be covering that's important for people to know about?
[01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:43.936]  And that's why I got into all the mind control that's on record through the television set, and through these new light bulbs that they admit are designed to flicker, to put you into a mesmerized state, or even physically have physical effects on you.
[01:12:44.436 --> 01:12:49.920]  I mean, I think that's pretty important for folks that are tuning in, saying, what is this show, you know, really all about?
[01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:53.383]  Well, it's about serious issues happening in our world.
[01:12:53.963 --> 01:12:56.145]  How many years, if you're a longtime listener,
[01:12:57.642 --> 01:13:01.144]  Or if you're a new listener, you can just search the term, you know, Pentagon spying on U.S.
[01:13:01.184 --> 01:13:07.428]  citizens, Pentagon spying on Congress, MI6, Special Air Services spying on British Parliament.
[01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:09.669]  The Parliament's the real British government.
[01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:11.750]  Should be the people's government.
[01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:13.251]  The Congress is the government.
[01:13:14.112 --> 01:13:17.534]  How does Homeland Security tell them we're not going to let you have these documents or those documents?
[01:13:18.154 --> 01:13:19.255]  In the Intelligence Committee.
[01:13:20.335 --> 01:13:24.317]  Or we're not going to give you the full text of George Bush's executive order dealing with martial law.
[01:13:24.337 --> 01:13:26.879]  Or we're not going to give you the full text of Obama's executive order.
[01:13:27.864 --> 01:13:30.285]  What does it mean when you see this going on?
[01:13:31.605 --> 01:13:38.588]  And what does it mean when we see headlines like this out of Rolling Stone?
[01:13:39.008 --> 01:13:42.189]  It was Rolling Stone that brought down McChrystal last year.
[01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:46.170]  Probably one of the most influential magazines out there.
[01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:47.311]  I know it's in the top three.
[01:13:48.051 --> 01:13:49.412]  Maybe Vanity Fair is as big.
[01:13:51.112 --> 01:13:52.693]  And it's another runaway general.
[01:13:52.893 --> 01:13:55.934]  Army deploys PSYOPs on Senators.
[01:13:58.058 --> 01:14:13.631]  And it goes on to basically say that Lieutenant General William Cadwell ordered McChrystal to engage in psychological warfare operations against Congress.
[01:14:15.152 --> 01:14:17.354]  And they certainly do this, but when you read it,
[01:14:19.434 --> 01:14:30.042]  This is standard operating procedure where the defense contractors deploy psyops on the generals to get them to lobby for the weapon systems they want.
[01:14:31.003 --> 01:14:35.366]  The generals go and lobby and try to put on a show.
[01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:39.730]  Uh, for the Congress people.
[01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.272]  I mean, that's, that's what they do.
[01:14:42.012 --> 01:14:56.065]  I'm not saying it's a good thing, but instead of getting into the confirmed reports, the Total Information Awareness Network, the NSA, Google, tracking politicians and people and collecting that dirt to then be put out through WikiLeaks and others,
[01:14:57.833 --> 01:15:11.519]  Instead of them focusing on the real stuff that's going on, they basically go after this Lieutenant General William Caldwell for things that aren't really what you'd call a real PSYOP.
[01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:13.579]  See what I'm saying?
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:22.203]  So, very, very suspicious on that front, and I'm not one to shy away from the arena.
[01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:27.493]  I get an opportunity to interview the former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[01:15:28.334 --> 01:15:29.175]  We get them on.
[01:15:30.035 --> 01:15:32.158]  I have the opportunity to interview Charlton Heston.
[01:15:32.418 --> 01:15:33.038]  We got them on.
[01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:41.427]  I have the opportunity to interview Charlie Sheen during the biggest tabloid cycle ever seen with him, or anybody else for that matter.
[01:15:41.507 --> 01:15:42.007]  I get them on.
[01:15:43.389 --> 01:15:45.271]  And when Rolling Stone came here and interviewed me,
[01:15:47.273 --> 01:15:48.175]  I stepped up and did it.
[01:15:48.276 --> 01:15:52.707]  And I don't know when it's coming out or if it's going to come out or exactly what's going to happen with that.
[01:15:52.747 --> 01:15:54.311]  But I'll tell you, I'm creeped out by it.
[01:15:54.351 --> 01:15:55.614]  The reporters seemed nice enough.
[01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.028]  The reporter lied to me.
[01:15:59.068 --> 01:16:01.170]  He's one of the best liars I've ever seen.
[01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:04.352]  Because you can just tell when somebody's lying to you.
[01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.014]  But sometimes people are delusional.
[01:16:06.074 --> 01:16:07.035]  They think they're right.
[01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:12.619]  So when they're telling you something, it's kind of a spin or a riddle when they say, oh, it's going to be fair.
[01:16:12.739 --> 01:16:15.021]  Oh, no, I'm going to really show your side of things.
[01:16:15.902 --> 01:16:17.023]  So we're going to find out, though.
[01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:19.064]  Yeah, if and when that comes out.
[01:16:35.899 --> 01:16:37.940]  The orders came from command of Lt.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:38.280]  Gen.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:44.862]  William Caldwell, a three-star general in charge of training Afghan troops, the linchpin of U.S.
[01:16:44.882 --> 01:16:45.662]  strategy in the war.
[01:16:46.042 --> 01:16:51.163]  Over a four-month period last year, a military cell devoted to what is known as information operations.
[01:16:51.584 --> 01:16:53.144]  Well, those are admittedly run in the U.S.
[01:16:53.924 --> 01:16:57.165]  When you see pro-military, pro-war messages in movies, it's paid for.
[01:16:57.265 --> 01:16:57.865]  That's public.
[01:16:58.846 --> 01:16:59.746]  But they don't report on that.
[01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:00.803]  Really?
[01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:01.123]  Really?
[01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:06.267]  Again, this guy may be horrible, but for all I know, he's not playing ball and they're just burning him.
[01:17:30.387 --> 01:17:41.137]  Continuing, my job in PSYOPS is to play with people's heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave, said Lieutenant Colonel Michael Holmes, the leader of the I.O.
[01:17:41.277 --> 01:17:44.700]  unit who received an official reprimand after bucking orders.
[01:17:45.301 --> 01:17:48.404]  I'm prohibited from doing that to our own people.
[01:17:48.784 --> 01:17:54.009]  When you ask me to try to use these skills on senators and congressmen, you've crossed the line.
[01:17:55.452 --> 01:17:59.554]  The list of targeted visitors was long, according to interviews with members of the I.O.
[01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:02.035]  team and internal documents obtained by Rolling Stones.
[01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:16.783]  Those singled out in the campaign included Senators John McCain, Joe Lieberman, Jack Reed, Al Franken, Carl Levin, Representative Steve Israel of the House Appropriations Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, so that's them targeting their own officers.
[01:18:17.683 --> 01:18:23.329]  The Czech Ambassador to Afghanistan, the German Interior Minister, and a host of influential think tank analysts.
[01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:35.682]  How is it PSYOPs, I mean it's PSYOPs that prepares, whether it's white PSYOPs or black PSYOPs, that prepares the briefing for what they believe needs to be done.
[01:18:36.562 --> 01:18:39.385]  When they make a PowerPoint to show a Senator, is that a PSYOP?
[01:18:40.206 --> 01:18:43.148]  It's only a black PSYOP if there's lies in it.
[01:18:43.649 --> 01:18:47.311]  And I read this whole article, and it isn't clear where the lies are.
[01:18:47.832 --> 01:18:50.153]  They're just saying it was their view of what they wanted.
[01:18:50.754 --> 01:18:53.395]  So what do you expect front-line commanding generals to do?
[01:18:55.277 --> 01:18:57.338]  And usually their best brains are in PSYOPs.
[01:18:58.039 --> 01:18:59.100]  Who's going to write the reports?
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.321]  Who's going to sell whatever they want to do?
[01:19:01.902 --> 01:19:02.842]  I want to leave right now.
[01:19:03.383 --> 01:19:05.024]  I've had countless military officers on.
[01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:11.072]  Anthony Schafer, Colonel Schafer, others saying get out of there.
[01:19:11.152 --> 01:19:11.653]  End it now.
[01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:22.702]  But the point is to say that generals are doing something big and nasty and dirty because they were trying to prepare their pitch for what they wanted.
[01:19:23.383 --> 01:19:26.726]  What do you think frontline generals do when the bosses come?
[01:19:28.007 --> 01:19:29.828]  They go and tell them what they think should be done.
[01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:32.851]  I mean it's crazy.
[01:19:36.493 --> 01:19:46.321]  I don't know, very... Looks like Rolling Stone's being used to, like, root out generals the globalists aren't happy with.
[01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:49.504]  I mean, would they have written an article attacking Fox Fallon?
[01:19:50.204 --> 01:19:56.770]  They used, what was it, GQ or Vanity Fair to bring him down, because Fallon wouldn't launch a preemptive attack on Iran.
[01:19:57.090 --> 01:19:59.832]  We'll come back, get into what's happening in Libya, the economy, oil.
[01:20:00.092 --> 01:20:00.633]  It's all coming up.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.223]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:05.283 --> 01:20:09.127]  My name is Van, and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:20:09.487 --> 01:20:13.951]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:20:14.231 --> 01:20:16.132]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:20:16.152 --> 01:20:17.614]  It made me feel breathless.
[01:20:18.034 --> 01:20:22.057]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:23.479]  Nothing did anything.
[01:20:23.559 --> 01:20:27.482]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:20:27.682 --> 01:20:30.964]  I saw one of Sharon's ads in Ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:20:31.644 --> 01:20:34.325]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:20:34.726 --> 01:20:39.408]  The episodes became less frequent, and by a month I completely vanished.

[01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:50.666]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:21:00.752 --> 01:21:01.913]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:21:01.933 --> 01:21:08.637]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:11.199]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:21:11.479 --> 01:21:16.663]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:21:16.863 --> 01:21:19.685]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:21:19.825 --> 01:21:21.946]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:21:22.146 --> 01:21:28.110]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:31.652]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:21:31.832 --> 01:21:37.395]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:21:37.636 --> 01:21:38.956]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:21:39.297 --> 01:21:40.477]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:21:40.597 --> 01:21:43.159]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:21:43.279 --> 01:21:44.700]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.342]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:21:47.523 --> 01:21:51.947]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:21:52.067 --> 01:21:53.068]  That's End of America.
[01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.549]  The number 3.com.

[01:22:00.675 --> 01:22:04.337]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:04.757 --> 01:22:10.160]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.701]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:11.741 --> 01:22:15.783]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:16.443 --> 01:22:29.852]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:22:30.253 --> 01:22:35.556]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:22:35.856 --> 01:22:41.741]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:23:00.071 --> 01:23:03.354]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:04.175 --> 01:23:08.419]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:08.679 --> 01:23:14.605]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:14.845 --> 01:23:16.987]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:17.267 --> 01:23:23.253]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:23.353 --> 01:23:26.695]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:26.755 --> 01:23:28.456]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.677]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:46.886]  800-477-9256, or zero-debt-guarantee.com.
[01:23:46.906 --> 01:23:47.347]  We've got it.
[01:23:47.367 --> 01:23:48.387]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:31.558]  Okay, the situation in Tripoli is getting more intense by the hour.
[01:24:31.618 --> 01:24:34.400]  Gaddafi militia opened fire on protesters.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:41.326]  Libyans hold mass protests and push to oust leader military forces organized in cities captured by the
[01:24:42.407 --> 01:24:49.434]  Rebels are now beginning to mass to march on Tripoli, where the dictator is still dug in.
[01:24:49.975 --> 01:24:51.957]  Oil production to shut down completely.
[01:24:52.037 --> 01:24:54.980]  Rebels say they have seized control of oil fields.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:59.664]  Qaddafi orders $400, which doesn't sound like a lot here, but it is there.
[01:25:00.305 --> 01:25:01.806]  That's more than a lot of make in a month.
[01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:05.648]  Per family, as rebels close in on Triboli, U.S.
[01:25:05.888 --> 01:25:06.929]  paper reports U.S.
[01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:10.791]  government characterized boat too small to rescue stranded Americans.
[01:25:11.452 --> 01:25:13.033]  Government can't even get Americans out of there.
[01:25:13.133 --> 01:25:13.893]  State Department can't.
[01:25:14.334 --> 01:25:15.895]  They're too busy trafficking in narcotics.
[01:25:16.655 --> 01:25:19.357]  Eleven killed as Iraqi protest in day of rage.
[01:25:20.337 --> 01:25:21.559]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:25:21.699 --> 01:25:23.100]  Syria rejects nuke probe.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.902]  China's web police block U.S.
[01:25:24.942 --> 01:25:25.883]  Ambassador's name.
[01:25:26.403 --> 01:25:29.686]  Al Jazeera enrages dictators, wins viewers with coverage.
[01:25:30.247 --> 01:25:33.410]  USA, quote, will drop the world's third largest economy.
[01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.372]  Government shutdown looms.
[01:25:35.852 --> 01:25:40.516]  White House reverberates with all the different things that are happening.
[01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:43.639]  We're going to be breaking that down, but going more into Libya.
[01:25:44.585 --> 01:25:45.787]  I don't think so.
[01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:25.616]  Last night, as reports emerged Thursday about deadly clashes between leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces and anti-government protesters in the town of Zawinia near Tunisia, analysts highlighted how Gaddafi has already pledged to fight a rebellion to martyrdom, and his top ministers are saying he will commit suicide like, quote, Hitler did.
[01:26:27.362 --> 01:26:39.443]  Continuing, military intervention is something which I hope doesn't happen, but it looks as though at some point that it should happen, said Simon Henderson, senior fellow at the Washington Institute on Near East Policy.
[01:26:40.848 --> 01:26:42.569]  What's an acceptable number of civilian deaths?
[01:26:42.589 --> 01:26:42.829]  I don't know.
[01:26:42.849 --> 01:26:44.149]  You killed a million in Iraq.
[01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:45.410]  A globalist did.
[01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:46.310]  I don't know.
[01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:47.931]  Choose your figure, Henderson said.
[01:26:48.091 --> 01:27:01.737]  At the very least, instead of having a casualty list, certainly in the hundreds, possibly of the thousands, we don't want a casualty list numbering in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or so.
[01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:03.118]  Well, the U.N.
[01:27:03.138 --> 01:27:07.900]  didn't care when hundreds of thousands were being hacked up and murdered in Rwanda back in 94.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.281]  They don't care about the
[01:27:10.814 --> 01:27:26.578]  What, from 1990 to 2003, the hundreds of thousands that died on record from the sanctions, the lands that, what's said a couple years ago, was over a million Iraqis that have died because of the war since then.
[01:27:26.598 --> 01:27:33.119]  So, I mean, how many years from 1990 in the middle of Desert Shield or Desert Storm and 91 into
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.684]  The whole situation with the invasion in 2003, how many years is that?
[01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:42.106]  How many years?
[01:27:42.146 --> 01:27:43.067]  We're talking about 20 years?
[01:27:43.087 --> 01:27:43.067]  1990?
[01:27:43.107 --> 01:27:46.170]  2011?
[01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:46.170]  Almost, almost 21 years that we're dealing with there.
[01:27:54.279 --> 01:27:57.401]  I mean, the same hypocrisy I'm talking about here, and I'm not saying Gaddafi's good.
[01:27:57.501 --> 01:27:57.761]  Good.
[01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:58.901]  People overthrow him, great.
[01:27:59.142 --> 01:28:13.969]  But the globalists are on record stemming rebellions against their tyranny in countries they control, but then helping to overthrow nations, not to bring stability, not to let the people actually have self-determination, but to basically destabilize things.
[01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:21.713]  And then they say, oh, how horrible it is that he's reportedly strafing people trying to take over the Capitol and overrun military bases when
[01:28:22.313 --> 01:28:40.361]  The people running our country have over a thousand drones operating in Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and they called it acceptable to kill hundreds of innocent people in apartment buildings, at weddings, at markets, outdoor markets, to kill one supposed bad guy.
[01:28:42.102 --> 01:28:48.985]  But then, it's good when the globalists do it, in our name, but then it's bad when somebody else does it.
[01:28:50.796 --> 01:28:54.818]  No, it's bad when Qaddafi does it, and it's bad when the people running our country do it.
[01:28:55.459 --> 01:28:57.000]  It's just that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.121]  This is twisted thinking that we're being sold here.
[01:29:00.702 --> 01:29:04.024]  But we saw Obama two nights ago, what, Wednesday night?
[01:29:05.405 --> 01:29:11.508]  Or was it, now time's flying, was it Tuesday night, say, for days we've been preparing a response into Libya.
[01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:16.071]  And now we're seeing more and more reports that they're planning to send NATO in there.
[01:29:17.376 --> 01:29:20.698]  And Qaddafi has been buying a lot of weapons for a long time.
[01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:24.741]  And we've already seen oil prices go to the record since 2008.
[01:29:25.321 --> 01:29:31.865]  And other commodities just going parabolic, ballistic, straight up like a rocket.
[01:29:32.806 --> 01:29:36.589]  We're going to come back and get into Libyan oil production to shut down completely.
[01:29:36.609 --> 01:29:43.013]  B of A says, Libyans hold mass protests to push to Al's leader.
[01:29:44.414 --> 01:29:47.216]  Covert US military support for Libyan opposition.
[01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:48.737]  It's all coming up.
[01:29:48.757 --> 01:29:49.277]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.599 --> 01:29:52.479]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:54.581]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.522 --> 01:29:58.203]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.295 --> 01:30:09.139]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.399 --> 01:30:11.680]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:17.142]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:17.323 --> 01:30:20.104]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:20.364 --> 01:30:22.425]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:28.610]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:32.132]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.312 --> 01:30:37.856]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:38.097 --> 01:30:39.398]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.738 --> 01:30:40.899]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:43.581]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.701 --> 01:30:47.744]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.924 --> 01:30:49.645]  You can find the video at www.
[01:30:50.706 --> 01:30:52.410]  End of America 3.com.
[01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.995]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:31:02.898 --> 01:31:06.521]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:14.988]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:31:15.728 --> 01:31:19.751]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:31:20.352 --> 01:31:31.181]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:40.803]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:41.303 --> 01:31:46.324]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:31:46.725 --> 01:31:53.906]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:54.226 --> 01:31:56.967]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:05.752]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:06.132 --> 01:32:09.135]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:09.375 --> 01:32:14.159]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:14.179 --> 01:32:20.385]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:20.565 --> 01:32:22.808]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:23.328 --> 01:32:23.628]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.648 --> 01:32:24.068]  Bernanke?
[01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.749]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.769 --> 01:32:25.589]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:28.351]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:42.239 --> 01:32:49.168]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:49.529 --> 01:32:58.641]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:07.034 --> 01:33:08.515]  Monday through Friday.
[01:33:29.385 --> 01:33:29.966]  11 a.m.
[01:33:30.286 --> 01:33:31.046]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:31.246 --> 01:33:32.447]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:32.487 --> 01:33:36.669]  We are here live on the back Sunday, live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:38.290]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:38.851 --> 01:33:43.093]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:45.728 --> 01:33:51.953]  I want to get into the Charlie Sheen situation here in just a moment, but before I do that, I want to continue with all the big news around the world.
[01:33:52.373 --> 01:33:56.036]  Libyan oil production to shut down completely, BOA reports.
[01:33:56.617 --> 01:34:05.163]  Oil production in Libya is expected to shut down completely and could be lost for a prolonged period of time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said last night.
[01:34:05.183 --> 01:34:14.391]  We expect Libyan production to be shut down completely and we might lose sweet crude from Libya for a prolonged period of time, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst
[01:34:15.612 --> 01:34:33.207]  Sabine Sherrells told Reuters they went on to report that the world faced the prospect of a real supply shock in which the loss of 1.6 million barrels per day of sweet oil could potentially trigger a steep rise in prices and force a sharp reduction in demand to balance the system.
[01:34:33.787 --> 01:34:36.730]  What did Lindsey Williams say here in October?
[01:34:37.911 --> 01:34:40.974]  And then what did he say on Monday?
[01:34:42.466 --> 01:34:44.247]  What did he say on Tuesday?
[01:34:45.047 --> 01:34:48.528]  And, of course, he's talking to a former Will Company head of one of the big three.
[01:34:49.588 --> 01:34:51.069]  They have staged all of this.
[01:34:51.809 --> 01:34:53.850]  You've got countries on the edge of revolt already.
[01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.691]  The globalists devalue the dollar.
[01:34:56.031 --> 01:34:58.872]  The people are even more on the edge of their seats, angry, hungry.
[01:34:59.332 --> 01:35:00.472]  Then they send in the teams.
[01:35:00.532 --> 01:35:01.332]  Google goes in.
[01:35:01.493 --> 01:35:02.413]  NSA goes in.
[01:35:02.493 --> 01:35:03.513]  CIA goes in.
[01:35:03.873 --> 01:35:05.034]  British Intel goes in.
[01:35:06.118 --> 01:35:13.965]  Flips the switch, turns the people loose, Al Jazeera beaming into the countries, gets behind it, and they start falling like dominoes.
[01:35:14.286 --> 01:35:15.347]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:35:15.807 --> 01:35:17.208]  Insurrection everywhere.
[01:35:17.609 --> 01:35:19.851]  Oil prices going straight up.
[01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:24.062]  Playin' the world like a fiddle.
[01:35:24.743 --> 01:35:28.446]  Libyans hold mass protest and push to oust leader, AP reports.
[01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:39.394]  Thousands of Libyans demanding Muammar Gaddafi's ouster rallied to show solidarity with the besieged capital, while the government moved to tighten its grip on Tripoli following opposition gains elsewhere in the country.
[01:35:39.815 --> 01:35:47.221]  Tanks at checkpoints lined the road leading to Tripoli's airport, and security cordons went up around mosques where protesters might gather.
[01:35:47.941 --> 01:35:54.822]  Young armed men, some wearing green bands on their arms in sign of loyalty to Qaddafi, checked vehicles for weapons.
[01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:57.603]  Yep, slaves are disarmed.
[01:35:58.023 --> 01:36:08.926]  Foreign mercenaries and Libyan militiamen loyal to Qaddafi have fought fiercely to roll back the uprising against his rule, attacking two nearby cities Thursday in battles that killed at least 17 people.
[01:36:09.266 --> 01:36:15.307]  But rebels made new gains, seizing a military airbase as Qaddafi blamed Osama bin Laden for the upheaval.
[01:36:16.287 --> 01:36:33.555]  uh... and it is the quote muslim extremist it was uh... the al-qaeda back groups on record that overthrew pristina and then when the serbs rolled into their own territory uh... they were uh... the nato invaded uh... it it was u.s.
[01:36:33.635 --> 01:36:43.420]  backed mujahideen slash al-qaeda that attacked the russians in seventy nine to elicit their invasion a year later that's... Brzezinski wrote a book bragging about how he engineered it all
[01:36:44.548 --> 01:36:46.608]  I'm not saying the Russians were little angel cakes.
[01:36:46.668 --> 01:36:48.329]  I'm not saying Gaddafi's a good guy.
[01:36:48.689 --> 01:36:51.809]  I'm saying what they did, the true story of what happened.
[01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:55.750]  And you like the oil prices going up?
[01:36:56.110 --> 01:37:02.531]  You like the fact that the media is saying, oh, Middle East turmoil is going to cause the recession to come back.
[01:37:02.571 --> 01:37:05.192]  They're going to blame the depression on it, just as we told you.
[01:37:06.392 --> 01:37:08.293]  We understand their game plan.
[01:37:08.793 --> 01:37:10.673]  We see what they're doing.
[01:37:13.052 --> 01:37:13.953]  Covert U.S.
[01:37:13.993 --> 01:37:16.275]  military support for Libyan opposition.
[01:37:18.477 --> 01:37:22.060]  Great report up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:27.525]  Also you can find it at LandDestroyer website.
[01:37:28.806 --> 01:37:29.887]  It says covert U.S.
[01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:32.009]  military support for Libyan opposition.
[01:37:33.442 --> 01:37:39.830]  Libya's Qaddafi stands between the United States and their campaign of destabilization and regime change across the oil-laden region.
[01:37:40.391 --> 01:37:49.902]  Not only does this stall the Anglo-American agenda, it also sets a precedence of defiance of other sovereign nations may duplicate under similar U.S.-backed instability.
[01:37:50.383 --> 01:37:51.484]  And I wouldn't say U.S.-backed.
[01:37:52.285 --> 01:37:54.186]  Occupied U.S.-backed instability.
[01:37:54.586 --> 01:37:57.047]  While all options are on the table, the U.S.
[01:37:57.107 --> 01:38:03.891]  most likely has already provided Libya's Ibrahim Saad's men with military support.
[01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:07.533]  Well, that's actually in the Washington Post.
[01:38:08.774 --> 01:38:10.095]  They had already done so in 1984.
[01:38:11.397 --> 01:38:15.801]  There is no doubt that the unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, and now Libya is U.S.-backed.
[01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:23.209]  Libyan opposition leader Ibrahim Said, from pronouncing that right, of the Nationalist Front of the Salvation of Libya,
[01:38:23.729 --> 01:38:35.382]  He's literally sitting in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., giving interviews, and he has links to those, repeating verbatim the talking points covered by propaganda outfits like BBC, CNN, Fox News, and Al Jazeera.
[01:38:35.663 --> 01:38:37.024]  Meanwhile, a myriad of U.S.
[01:38:37.124 --> 01:38:43.311]  organizations are working in tandem with his calls for U.N., E.U., U.S., and NATO intervention.
[01:38:43.672 --> 01:38:44.293]  It'll be NATO.
[01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:47.412]  With a UN umbrella over it.
[01:39:03.078 --> 01:39:03.918]  Well, ahead of time.
[01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:06.519]  Well, we know they were in the case of Egypt.
[01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:16.041]  In regards to sparking a revolution in Iran, Brookings concludes that Iran will most assuredly crush it at any cost, ensuring the revolution's failure.
[01:39:16.521 --> 01:39:21.402]  You know, they stood up against the Iraqis that were given high-tech weapons and advisors from the U.S.
[01:39:21.882 --> 01:39:23.342]  The Iranians don't play games, folks.
[01:39:24.082 --> 01:39:26.183]  Boy, I tell you, they try to have us invade that.
[01:39:26.203 --> 01:39:27.683]  Man, that's going to be our Waterloo.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.745]  I know the Globalists are running it, but it will be our Waterloo because they're dragging us with them into Hades.
[01:39:33.246 --> 01:39:39.274]  Considering this, Brookings insists certain measures must be taken to diminish Iran's ability to crush a revolution.
[01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:46.053]  Consequently, if the United States is to pursue this policy, Washington must take this possibility into consideration.
[01:39:46.473 --> 01:39:48.534]  It adds some very important requirements to the list.
[01:39:48.874 --> 01:39:59.359]  Either the policy must include ways to weaken the Iranian military, or weaken its willingness of the regime's leaders to call on the military, or else the United States may be ready to intervene to defeat it.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.020]  Same thing we're seeing in Libya.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:08.744]  One of the authors, Which Path to Persia?, globalist Rand policy wonk, and 9-11 Commission whitewasher, Daniel Byman,
[01:40:10.117 --> 01:40:12.438]  has been quite vocal lately regarding Libya.
[01:40:12.798 --> 01:40:24.100]  In a piece written for Slate titled, Things Could Get a Lot Worse in Libya, Byman concludes by saying a massive invasion of Libya is not going to happen.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.680]  Rather, he suggests the U.S.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:33.242]  organize the opposition to Qaddafi, encouraging a broad political front and urging military leaders to declare their support by us.
[01:40:33.262 --> 01:40:37.123]  Yeah, the threat to invade just could be a way to undermine Qaddafi and make him look weak.
[01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:38.886]  I
[01:40:53.766 --> 01:41:07.595]  violently overthrow Qaddafi in 84, the Library of Congress document goes on to explain that according to various sources in the United States Central Intelligence Agency, CIA trained and supported the NFSL before and after the failed coup.
[01:41:08.035 --> 01:41:18.722]  With this back story, it is highly unlikely the US strategists naively expected a velvet revolution in Libya and most likely modified their 1984 plan to overthrow Qaddafi with armed rebels.
[01:41:19.562 --> 01:41:22.785]  While President Obama shamelessly lies to the world about U.S.
[01:41:23.245 --> 01:41:31.892]  hands being clean of interference with Libya's sovereignty, it appears that the NFSL has a long history of being supported and directed by the U.S.
[01:41:31.972 --> 01:41:36.877]  Most apparent was the NFSL's leaders currently operating out of Washington, D.C.
[01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:42.822]  It also appears that the NFSL is already armed to the teeth and waging a military campaign against Qaddafi.
[01:41:43.382 --> 01:41:46.503]  And then when Qaddafi fights back against it, it's called attacking civilians, I would add.
[01:41:47.323 --> 01:41:49.244]  And that's just a dishonest thing by the media.
[01:41:49.544 --> 01:41:53.685]  I mean, you can all be for doing this if you think it's good for America out there.
[01:41:54.045 --> 01:41:54.905]  Clearly it's not.
[01:41:55.746 --> 01:42:00.067]  It's not good for our liberties, good for our freedoms, good for oil prices, but...
[01:42:01.227 --> 01:42:03.870]  Just don't lie to yourself that this organically happened.
[01:42:04.732 --> 01:42:05.613]  On the back of a U.S.
[01:42:05.633 --> 01:42:13.823]  stoked regional instability, even Qaddafi himself is accusing the West of arming the NFSL in the latest round of Libyan unrest.
[01:42:13.843 --> 01:42:14.704]  And the article goes on.
[01:42:14.764 --> 01:42:16.987]  It's excellent, excellent, excellent research.
[01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:23.927]  From Tony Cardalucci of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:23.987 --> 01:42:33.496]  Great job, that guy's writing some really expert, well-researched articles for us on multiple time basis per day, so I want to salute his work.
[01:42:35.498 --> 01:42:39.522]  Okay, Kurt Nemo has another article basically getting into this, but detailing some other facets.
[01:42:39.562 --> 01:42:41.984]  Media demonizes Qaddafi as Pentagon prepares attack.
[01:42:42.024 --> 01:42:42.685]  That's very important.
[01:42:42.705 --> 01:42:43.786]  I mean, we're talking about a new war!
[01:42:45.217 --> 01:42:45.818]  How many more?
[01:42:45.898 --> 01:42:50.461]  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, incursions into many other countries.
[01:42:50.642 --> 01:42:55.986]  There's a big undeclared war been going on for years in Colombia with U.S.
[01:42:56.026 --> 01:42:57.767]  forces down there.
[01:42:58.428 --> 01:43:02.031]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:43:05.193 --> 01:43:11.879]  Now, shifting gears into Charlie Sheen, with all this important world news going on,
[01:43:16.195 --> 01:43:21.836]  We are forced to talk about this because we are in the middle of it.
[01:43:22.676 --> 01:43:34.459]  I mean, I've got every few minutes, radio, TV, some of the biggest shows in the country wanting to fly me places, satellite interviews lined up perpetually.
[01:43:35.879 --> 01:43:39.280]  And at one level, I'm not happy about it.
[01:43:41.229 --> 01:43:46.491]  But at another level, I know that we're going to be able to inject real issues while I'm on those programs.
[01:43:46.531 --> 01:43:52.172]  I was able to plug InfoWars.com repeatedly on MSNBC today and on some other stations as well.
[01:43:53.013 --> 01:43:56.594]  And I've been, again, invited to some of the biggest sit-down interview shows in the country.
[01:43:56.734 --> 01:43:58.114]  And I don't want to go.
[01:43:58.134 --> 01:43:59.695]  I don't want to face the TSA.
[01:43:59.715 --> 01:44:03.296]  I don't want to do it.
[01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:06.337]  Some of these shows demand that you be in studio with them.
[01:44:09.397 --> 01:44:13.539]  But I'll probably do it because it's a way to get the word out.
[01:44:13.779 --> 01:44:24.323]  And Charlie, who's obviously gone through a lot and was in a very fired up, angry mode yesterday, the angriest I've ever seen him, we kind of spun the wheel of fortune.
[01:44:24.903 --> 01:44:32.786]  And when he came on, it rolled to a number that spelled explosion.
[01:44:34.178 --> 01:44:41.884]  That's what happened and I've already several times because of some of the coarse language and things that we did did to lay out but some on the internet heard it.
[01:44:42.544 --> 01:44:53.613]  I apologize for that but I can't apologize for Charlie he's who he is he's obviously feels like he's breaking out of a gilded cage and that AA was a cult and then he's off alcohol and things by himself.
[01:44:54.333 --> 01:44:57.474]  And he doesn't want to be basically oppressed by them.
[01:44:57.514 --> 01:45:00.115]  And most of the people in his life were AA people.
[01:45:00.455 --> 01:45:02.716]  All the times I stayed at his house, that's basically who was there.
[01:45:02.736 --> 01:45:04.296]  It was AA this, AA that.
[01:45:04.936 --> 01:45:11.979]  I'd never seen him drink, never seen him use drugs, never seen him running around with women other than, you know, his wife.
[01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:21.942]  Many times I stayed at his house because when I'd be out there for a TV show or out there for conspiracy theory or out there doing research, you know, I'd stay at Charlie's house.
[01:45:22.702 --> 01:45:23.904]  I've stayed there for a week before.
[01:45:24.704 --> 01:45:26.847]  And let me tell you, the guy wasn't on drugs.
[01:45:26.907 --> 01:45:31.192]  Now, seven, eight months ago, he started partying and it kind of led to what you saw.
[01:45:31.633 --> 01:45:33.114]  He really did have the hernia problem.
[01:45:33.154 --> 01:45:34.095]  I've seen his hernia.
[01:45:35.036 --> 01:45:36.899]  The surgery he had four years ago failed.
[01:45:37.299 --> 01:45:38.641]  He has to go back and have surgery.
[01:45:38.681 --> 01:45:40.082]  That is why he went to the hospital.
[01:45:40.948 --> 01:46:02.072]  and I was gonna get him on to explain that and that most of it wasn't true that he didn't have blood spraying out of his nose that he never met these big list of women they said he was with in Las Vegas never met him the tattooed lady bombshell McGee and the rest of it and that's what we were gonna get him on about but then he just kind of shifted gears into other areas and it's because Chuck Lorre
[01:46:05.512 --> 01:46:11.594]  continued on and on and on and on to do vanity cards.
[01:46:11.634 --> 01:46:13.894]  You know vanity cards are at the front and start of productions.
[01:46:14.394 --> 01:46:19.416]  The MGM Lion roaring is a vanity card at the front.
[01:46:20.576 --> 01:46:28.498]  You'll see vanity cards at the end of some shows where it'll be a robot laughing or an F-16 flying by.
[01:46:29.538 --> 01:46:49.939]  uh... or the vanity card it with the production company at the end of conspiracy theory jesse ventura is a b-two bomber swooping by for you know two seconds with the name of the production company uh... you've seen are quote vanity cards it's really just low going uh... where you cn info wars dot com logo at the start and the end of our youtube videos
[01:46:54.957 --> 01:46:55.077]  What's
[01:47:16.653 --> 01:47:17.733]  Said look, it's my hernia.
[01:47:17.853 --> 01:47:18.954]  Okay, I won't drink.
[01:47:19.014 --> 01:47:19.754]  I shouldn't do this stuff.
[01:47:19.794 --> 01:47:20.254]  I'm done.
[01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:23.115]  But don't sit there and come out and leak stuff in the news.
[01:47:23.936 --> 01:47:25.836]  This is what I privately heard Charlie talk about.
[01:47:25.876 --> 01:47:26.937]  Now he's publicly talked about it.
[01:47:27.377 --> 01:47:30.438]  And I saw him on the phone, you know, and there with him talking to his manager.
[01:47:30.478 --> 01:47:32.259]  I'm not going to get into, you know, much of that.
[01:47:32.299 --> 01:47:32.979]  But the point is,
[01:47:34.525 --> 01:47:39.972]  Chuck would put stuff out, or reportedly he would, through the media that, oh, the production team's mad at him.
[01:47:40.332 --> 01:47:49.584]  Now we're not going to have, you know, four of the episodes of The Eight that are left, which is, you know, paying people's paychecks there, you know, on the big crew because of Charlie.
[01:47:49.844 --> 01:47:51.766]  Oh, Charlie's like, look, I had a problem.
[01:47:52.623 --> 01:47:54.683]  And I'm better now and I want to come back.
[01:47:54.883 --> 01:48:00.905]  Don't say I can't come back now and then sit there and blame me and then put out vanity cards, not just on two-and-a-half men.
[01:48:01.665 --> 01:48:11.607]  I challenge the mainstream media to go look at the vanity cards on his other two hit shows he launched out of two-and-a-half men, where he basically says Charlie is soulless and unhappy.
[01:48:12.907 --> 01:48:14.327]  Well, if that's what he thinks, go help him.
[01:48:14.367 --> 01:48:14.908]  Go hug him.
[01:48:15.228 --> 01:48:15.908]  Be nice to him.
[01:48:16.268 --> 01:48:18.328]  The guy's made you hundreds of millions of dollars, reportedly.
[01:48:18.348 --> 01:48:19.829]  It's about $500 million Charlie's made.
[01:48:20.069 --> 01:48:21.469]  The guy makes like double what Charlie does.
[01:48:22.666 --> 01:48:35.056]  And on that one show, and Charlie's done things like give up part of his money to some of the lower paid people on the crew.
[01:48:36.177 --> 01:48:39.820]  And his co-host, not the kid, but the other man, what's his name?
[01:48:41.282 --> 01:48:41.942]  John Cryer.
[01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:51.110]  I mean, this is, Charlie's given some of his money to the crew, given it to Cryer, and I heard Charlie complain that then, that Lori,
[01:48:53.044 --> 01:48:54.505]  Uh, doesn't, doesn't do that.
[01:48:55.706 --> 01:49:04.953]  And, you know, Charlie really looks down on people who are super wealthy and who don't give to charity like Charlie does to breast cancer research and AIDS research.
[01:49:05.273 --> 01:49:06.454]  Gives a lot of his money to that.
[01:49:06.494 --> 01:49:07.175]  That's on record.
[01:49:07.215 --> 01:49:08.496]  He doesn't brag about it, but it's there.
[01:49:08.516 --> 01:49:13.640]  And, you know, he just talks about Lori, uh, you know, there at a premier event or something.
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.824]  And he watches Lori not give the person at the bar when he gets a club soda, a tip.
[01:49:20.686 --> 01:49:23.469]  And this is a guy who's made $500 million or more off the show.
[01:49:23.489 --> 01:49:26.433]  And that's why Charlie just more and more gets angry at him.
[01:49:26.753 --> 01:49:34.161]  And then Charlie has to sit there and be blamed for everything when the show wouldn't exist if it wasn't for him.
[01:49:34.381 --> 01:49:36.143]  He says, OK, I'm ready to come back right now.
[01:49:37.365 --> 01:49:44.393]  And they say no, and then they start putting vanity cards out, saying, I'm Chuck Lorre, I'm gonna live longer than Charlie Sheen.
[01:49:44.413 --> 01:49:47.537]  You know, I'm not a drug addict, pathetic person.
[01:49:47.557 --> 01:49:50.300]  I mean, in fact, guys, I didn't print them.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.264]  Will you print me Chuck Lorre vanity cards, attack Charlie Sheen?
[01:49:54.284 --> 01:49:57.047]  Instead of me just paraphrasing them, there's a whole bunch of them.
[01:49:57.853 --> 01:50:00.534]  Chuck Lorre vanity cards attack Charlie Sheen.
[01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:02.235]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:50:02.495 --> 01:50:04.196]  It's four or five of them, I know.
[01:50:04.516 --> 01:50:18.802]  And Charlie would sit there and talk to his manager and people would go, I've been told that if I criticize Chuck Lorre and even say, hey, I'm ready to come back to work and don't blame things on me, that the show's going to be canceled or I'm going to be fired.
[01:50:19.482 --> 01:50:23.244]  And then he's attacking me at the end of the show I'm in?
[01:50:24.434 --> 01:50:25.254]  And he said, fine.
[01:50:25.415 --> 01:50:26.195]  He laughed about it.
[01:50:26.235 --> 01:50:27.756]  We're like, hey, Charlie, it's all right.
[01:50:28.376 --> 01:50:30.237]  You know, why don't you try to be friends with Lori?
[01:50:30.738 --> 01:50:32.038]  And he's like, oh, all right.
[01:50:32.478 --> 01:50:33.939]  And then there's more stuff said about him.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:38.322]  And so basically, I guess he was angry about that when he happened to come on my show.
[01:50:38.842 --> 01:50:40.163]  And then it just exploded.
[01:50:41.303 --> 01:50:45.184]  So, I know the real Charlie Sheen, the loving, compassionate, good guy.
[01:50:45.504 --> 01:50:49.444]  He's angry, he's tired of being lied about, and he walked a mile in his shoes.
[01:50:49.484 --> 01:50:50.625]  Can you imagine the pressure?
[01:50:51.205 --> 01:50:53.865]  And, uh, it's just crazy.
[01:50:54.365 --> 01:50:55.826]  I mean, this whole thing.
[01:50:56.106 --> 01:50:59.366]  And Chuck Lorre, you bear a lot of responsibility here, pal.
[01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:01.386]  I mean, you threw the first punch.
[01:51:01.527 --> 01:51:02.747]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.807 --> 01:51:08.148]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.388 --> 01:51:09.988]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:10.228 --> 01:51:13.010]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:51:13.411 --> 01:51:13.791]  It's true.
[01:51:13.891 --> 01:51:18.495]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.

[01:54:16.090 --> 01:54:16.630]  Stand up.
[01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:18.311]  Finishing up with Charlie Sheen.
[01:54:18.691 --> 01:54:20.891]  People love to see huge stars.
[01:54:24.995 --> 01:54:25.655]  Off the hook.
[01:54:26.876 --> 01:54:29.897]  And they love to see big stars fall on their face.
[01:54:30.557 --> 01:54:31.618]  That's how they're trying to spin it.
[01:54:31.638 --> 01:54:34.159]  Because they like to see somebody big in trouble.
[01:54:34.239 --> 01:54:35.159]  Makes people feel good.
[01:54:35.439 --> 01:54:36.240]  Some people out there.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:50.185]  But I just want to point out again that Chuck Lorre, the creator and the head of Two and a Half Men, just continued to attack Charlie while using management pressure to keep Charlie from responding.
[01:54:50.225 --> 01:54:54.387]  And I just think that that is very regrettable.
[01:54:56.156 --> 01:55:02.601]  And, uh, I mean, what do you call it when you tie somebody's hands and then sit there and punch them in the nose?
[01:55:04.422 --> 01:55:05.343]  Don't say anything.
[01:55:05.463 --> 01:55:06.164]  The show's over.
[01:55:06.724 --> 01:55:08.305]  See, Chuck's got two other hit shows now.
[01:55:09.446 --> 01:55:10.567]  Maybe he didn't want to run three shows.
[01:55:11.968 --> 01:55:13.289]  Charlie thinks that might be what's going on.
[01:55:15.811 --> 01:55:17.352]  I mean, Chuck needs to respond to this.
[01:55:17.893 --> 01:55:19.154]  Now, it is being reported
[01:55:21.331 --> 01:55:24.575]  In fact, here's the headline out of the associated content.
[01:55:24.915 --> 01:55:28.759]  Chuck Lorre vanity card suspended along with men.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:34.606]  So obviously somebody in management said, look Chuck, and by the way, I went all over national TV last night and pointed this out.
[01:55:35.206 --> 01:55:38.990]  I said, okay, you can sit there and try to judge Charlie all day, but what about Chuck Lorre?
[01:55:39.929 --> 01:55:40.609]  What about him?
[01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:42.530]  What about him doing this?
[01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:43.471]  What is he doing?
[01:55:44.211 --> 01:55:46.232]  I don't know him from the man in the moon.
[01:55:46.252 --> 01:55:47.993]  I don't have any beef with Chuck Lorre.
[01:55:48.593 --> 01:55:51.314]  I didn't know all this was going to happen on air, but come on, Chuck.
[01:55:51.634 --> 01:55:57.277]  I mean, you sit there and you attack somebody while the management of CBS is telling Charlie Sheen to sit there and take it?
[01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:09.342]  And you can go to ChuckLorre.com and read the hundreds of these and where he just says incredibly horrible things about Charlie Sheen.
[01:56:13.144 --> 01:56:39.251]  and talks about emptiness and soulness of Charlie Sheen and how he's going to outlive Charlie Sheen or he'll be mad if he doesn't and it's just hard to even repeat all this stuff here on air and I don't know how the media could try to spin this and not understand that Charlie has rage and is angry about this when Chuck Lorre is the one that started it.
[01:56:40.612 --> 01:56:40.832]  I mean
[01:56:42.839 --> 01:56:47.583]  Even in law, they call it a crime of passion.
[01:56:47.683 --> 01:56:58.033]  Well, Charlie hasn't committed any crime here, but the point is, if you go up and insult somebody, or if a man comes in and finds his wife with another man, a lot of times the husband doesn't even get in trouble for what he does.
[01:56:58.493 --> 01:57:00.655]  Because people understand, it's a crime of passion.
[01:57:01.116 --> 01:57:07.762]  Well, this isn't a crime, but it's being spun like it is almost by the media.
[01:57:08.695 --> 01:57:11.316]  I mean, here's a Chuck Lorre Productions number 329.
[01:57:11.976 --> 01:57:13.056]  I exercise regularly.
[01:57:13.096 --> 01:57:14.417]  I eat moderate amounts of healthy food.
[01:57:14.457 --> 01:57:15.817]  I make sure to get plenty of rest.
[01:57:16.177 --> 01:57:18.398]  I see my doctor once a year and my dentist twice a year.
[01:57:18.758 --> 01:57:19.738]  I floss every night.
[01:57:20.338 --> 01:57:25.179]  I've had chest x-rays, cardio stress tests, EKGs, and colonoscopies.
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:28.820]  I see a psychologist and have a variety of hobbies to reduce stress.
[01:57:28.961 --> 01:57:29.461]  I don't drink.
[01:57:29.841 --> 01:57:30.441]  I don't smoke.
[01:57:30.521 --> 01:57:31.201]  I don't do drugs.
[01:57:31.461 --> 01:57:33.582]  I don't have crazy, reckless sex with strangers.
[01:57:34.762 --> 01:57:38.986]  If Charlie Sheen outlives me, I'm going to really be... And he says a little profanity there.
[01:57:39.707 --> 01:57:42.209]  But the point is, that's not even one of the bad ones.
[01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:46.152]  I mean, you know, he talks about Charlie being soulless and all this stuff.
[01:57:46.172 --> 01:57:47.233]  No, Charlie's got a soul.
[01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:47.773]  We all do.
[01:57:48.334 --> 01:57:51.917]  And it's a soul under a lot of pressure and a lot of torment.
[01:57:51.957 --> 01:57:54.159]  He's a guy who had the courage to come out for 9-11 Truth.
[01:57:54.439 --> 01:57:56.261]  He's a real guy and that's why I care about him.
[01:57:57.171 --> 01:58:02.695]  And it is scary to see what's going on and I was blown away by what happened.
[01:58:02.715 --> 01:58:24.790]  It came out of the blue for me and you and it's now a giant international news story and I just want to see Charlie back on his show or back doing a new show or whatever he wants but happy with his family and it's just he's in the middle of Los Angeles and all of that globalism and craziness and I went out there to try to support him and
[01:58:26.826 --> 01:58:33.914]  I just wish I could, you know, be around him more to try to help him because everybody around me said, look, you're really a good, quote, influence on him.
[01:58:37.558 --> 01:58:38.579]  Bob Chapman's coming up.
[01:58:38.599 --> 01:58:40.080]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.863 --> 01:58:44.185]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.285 --> 01:58:47.228]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.274 --> 01:58:55.497]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.817 --> 01:58:56.417]  Number one.
[01:58:56.738 --> 01:58:59.880]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:00.720]  Number two.
[01:59:01.021 --> 01:59:05.564]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.904 --> 01:59:06.344]  It's true.
[01:59:06.644 --> 01:59:11.207]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.528 --> 01:59:12.068]  Number three.
[01:59:12.348 --> 01:59:15.630]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.930 --> 01:59:19.653]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.833 --> 01:59:20.394]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.634 --> 01:59:22.996]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.397 --> 01:59:26.780]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:27.081 --> 01:59:27.281]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.861 --> 01:59:31.786]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:32.026 --> 01:59:36.791]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:37.051 --> 01:59:41.094]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.234 --> 01:59:42.795]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:43.015 --> 01:59:45.096]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:45.256 --> 01:59:47.858]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.878 --> 01:59:49.239]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:49.259 --> 01:59:55.063]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.987 --> 02:00:10.169]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.829 --> 02:00:11.630]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:13.310]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.951 --> 02:00:17.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.153 --> 02:00:22.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:36.748]  Okay, what I want to do is get into the economy, the bizarre glitch on the London Stock Exchange, like the one we saw last year with the 1,000 point drop.
[02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:38.670]  Clear manipulation going on there.
[02:00:39.631 --> 02:00:42.854]  I want to get into everything that's happening in Libya.
[02:00:42.914 --> 02:00:44.496]  I want to get into some good news.
[02:00:44.596 --> 02:00:45.417]  Virginia O.K.'
[02:00:45.397 --> 02:00:49.441]  's bill that will close most abortion clinics, moving in the right direction there.
[02:00:51.067 --> 02:00:53.428]  Thank God, and for all your prayers and action.
[02:00:54.028 --> 02:00:58.650]  I've got a lot to talk about here, but since we were just ending with it, maybe in this short segment, talk about it.
[02:00:59.090 --> 02:01:01.912]  Bob Chapman, have you seen the Charlie Sheen firestorm?
[02:01:04.113 --> 02:01:11.736]  I've heard about it, and I haven't heard your tape yet, because I've been so buried, but I do have it, and I will listen to it.
[02:01:12.503 --> 02:01:19.329]  Well, bottom line, any way you slice it, it's bringing ultra-massive attention to this radio broadcast and what's going on in the New World Order.
[02:01:19.349 --> 02:01:23.572]  Uh, and so, um, hopefully good will end up coming out of it.
[02:01:23.772 --> 02:01:25.194]  I'm just worried about Charlie.
[02:01:25.554 --> 02:01:38.685]  What do you think of his, uh, the creator of 2 1⁄2 Men with the vanity cards, putting out public essays on TV at the end of the show, calling Charlie Sheen horrible names, and then behind the scenes, Charlie being told not to respond or he'd be fired?
[02:01:40.717 --> 02:01:48.780]  Well, I've heard about that, and from what I understood this morning, that they had terminated the show.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.340]  Yes.
[02:01:51.941 --> 02:01:53.841]  Well, not terminated next season yet.
[02:01:54.201 --> 02:01:55.542]  They just had four episodes left.
[02:01:56.682 --> 02:01:57.042]  Yeah.
[02:01:57.962 --> 02:02:07.646]  It sort of seems like the network is biting off its own tongue, I guess, to get back at Charlie.
[02:02:11.208 --> 02:02:17.512]  I can't understand why they would make such a foolish business decision.
[02:02:19.033 --> 02:02:20.573]  Maybe they want to try to destroy him.
[02:02:20.633 --> 02:02:23.915]  I don't know, but I don't think they're going to be able to do that.
[02:02:25.856 --> 02:02:28.978]  He's had, you know, a lot of problems all of his life.
[02:02:30.199 --> 02:02:31.560]  It's not easy being famous.
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:32.960]  Hey, you lived out in that area.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:33.741]  Don't you know them?
[02:02:35.162 --> 02:02:39.484]  Well, I know his father fairly well because we used to go to church all the time together.
[02:02:40.991 --> 02:02:47.355]  And we'd often talk before and after and... Man, let me tell you, I know Martin Sheen pretty darn good.
[02:02:47.395 --> 02:02:50.177]  That is a super real, centered, classy guy.
[02:02:51.618 --> 02:03:10.369]  Well, he's very devout and I think, I'm just guessing, I think that when he had the heart attack, I think it was either during or after the filming of A Couple It's Now, that I think it changed him dramatically.
[02:03:11.603 --> 02:03:16.766]  And, you know, his thought processes and everything else.
[02:03:17.947 --> 02:03:21.249]  And, you know, we lived in Malibu for years.
[02:03:22.649 --> 02:03:25.291]  And it's really the fast lane, believe me.
[02:03:26.331 --> 02:03:31.174]  And I had two children that I brought up there.
[02:03:32.175 --> 02:03:34.016]  And it was very, very, very difficult.
[02:03:35.397 --> 02:03:36.737]  And I coached everything.
[02:03:36.757 --> 02:03:39.139]  I knew all the families and the kids.
[02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:41.810]  Many, many, many famous people.
[02:03:42.791 --> 02:03:47.013]  And so I know how difficult it was.
[02:03:47.113 --> 02:04:00.742]  And even with all the efforts that I made in trying to protect the children, sometimes even from their parents, because in those days, during the 70s and 80s, there was a lot of drugs going on.
[02:04:01.882 --> 02:04:03.944]  And but I did a pretty good job of it.
[02:04:05.084 --> 02:04:07.646]  And very few of the kids get involved in it.
[02:04:08.967 --> 02:04:09.107]  And
[02:04:10.137 --> 02:04:18.524]  But it was quite an experience, and I didn't really realize that that's what I was going to get into when I went there.
[02:04:19.565 --> 02:04:31.455]  In fact, as it turns out, all together I coached for about 35 years with children in different sports, particularly soccer, which I enjoyed very much.
[02:04:33.018 --> 02:04:35.059]  Much easier to coach than some of the other ones.
[02:04:35.859 --> 02:04:40.980]  But getting back to the network... Absolutely.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:41.321]  Stay there.
[02:04:41.361 --> 02:04:45.742]  Let's finish up with this, then get into what's happening geopolitically all over the world.
[02:04:46.602 --> 02:04:49.663]  On the other side with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:04:49.703 --> 02:04:52.864]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:53.124 --> 02:04:56.265]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[02:04:56.285 --> 02:04:56.705]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.363 --> 02:05:02.463]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:02.523 --> 02:05:09.186]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:09.446 --> 02:05:11.727]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:12.007 --> 02:05:17.169]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:17.389 --> 02:05:20.171]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.411 --> 02:05:22.532]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.732 --> 02:05:28.676]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.996 --> 02:05:32.199]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:32.379 --> 02:05:37.902]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:38.162 --> 02:05:39.463]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.803 --> 02:05:40.964]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:41.084 --> 02:05:43.646]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.766 --> 02:05:45.187]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:05:45.367 --> 02:05:45.807]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.357 --> 02:06:04.660]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:06.001]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:06.062 --> 02:06:10.426]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.626 --> 02:06:16.271]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.571 --> 02:06:18.553]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.713 --> 02:06:21.396]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:21.736 --> 02:06:28.039]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:06:28.239 --> 02:06:30.060]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:35.522]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:06:35.782 --> 02:06:40.784]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:06:41.064 --> 02:06:46.247]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:06:46.447 --> 02:06:49.388]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:06:49.628 --> 02:06:52.593]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:52.633 --> 02:06:53.394]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:04.867 --> 02:07:05.808]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:06.128 --> 02:07:09.811]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:09.991 --> 02:07:12.313]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:12.453 --> 02:07:17.737]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:18.157 --> 02:07:24.382]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:24.822 --> 02:07:30.346]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:30.766 --> 02:07:34.469]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:07:34.969 --> 02:07:38.972]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:39.272 --> 02:07:44.776]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:45.216 --> 02:07:48.199]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:48.779 --> 02:07:50.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:51.181]  It's here.

[02:08:02.285 --> 02:08:04.506]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.526 --> 02:08:07.867]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.075 --> 02:08:19.178]  Bob Chapman joins us every Friday.
[02:08:19.198 --> 02:08:21.220]  He's with the International Forecaster.
[02:08:22.121 --> 02:08:27.427]  Formerly worked in military intelligence, then became the biggest private silver and gold broker.
[02:08:27.827 --> 02:08:30.530]  Had the largest private newsletter until he retired.
[02:08:30.590 --> 02:08:34.174]  Then he's come back in the last decade or so with the International Forecaster.
[02:08:34.234 --> 02:08:37.357]  Widely read in almost every major country on the planet.
[02:08:37.738 --> 02:08:38.799]  Subscribers everywhere.
[02:08:39.519 --> 02:08:46.181]  But he did live a long time in Malibu, knows Martin Sheen well, I know Martin Sheen well, Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen.
[02:08:46.281 --> 02:08:53.743]  Obviously the biggest story in the country isn't Libya, though we've been covering that mainly, or isn't the oil prices going up or any of this stuff happening.
[02:08:53.783 --> 02:09:00.144]  It's Charlie Sheen's interview yesterday where he was just not even trying to be as shocking as possible.
[02:09:00.725 --> 02:09:01.385]  I mean he was just
[02:09:03.210 --> 02:09:12.054]  Just like completely wild and angry at Chuck Lorre and making a lot of jokes.
[02:09:12.114 --> 02:09:14.855]  That's how he deals with it is the humor.
[02:09:15.095 --> 02:09:24.840]  I know the humor side of Charlie, but he'd also had some shenanigans go on the first night he got to the Bahamas that I'm not going to get into.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.661]  He'd taken a nap right before we got him on air and it was wild.
[02:09:35.128 --> 02:09:51.785]  I don't know where it's going to go from here, but one good byproduct is that InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the syndicated radio broadcast that covers absolutely vital information for mainline fluoride TV heads, they're now finding this information, they're now tuning in here right now.
[02:09:53.187 --> 02:09:54.568]  You got cut off by the break, Bob.
[02:09:54.588 --> 02:09:56.629]  We're gonna move into the other things happening in the world.
[02:09:57.070 --> 02:09:58.951]  And we've said our piece on what's happened with Charlie.
[02:09:58.971 --> 02:10:05.417]  We all want to pray for him and his family and that he continue to be clean and that the show get back or whatever he wants happens.
[02:10:05.817 --> 02:10:07.218]  You know, dealing with that, it's his life.
[02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:12.763]  But you were trying to finish up with the network, allowing Chuck Lorre, the creator, to put these vanity cards.
[02:10:12.823 --> 02:10:14.664]  Most people have like a little logo at the end of the show.
[02:10:14.984 --> 02:10:16.065]  He has an essay there.
[02:10:17.186 --> 02:10:20.687]  Saying Charlie's soulless and basically garbage.
[02:10:20.727 --> 02:10:22.288]  Saying he's going to outlive Charlie.
[02:10:22.628 --> 02:10:26.329]  And then Charlie's told behind the scenes, you don't respond or we'll cancel the show.
[02:10:26.349 --> 02:10:32.971]  That just sounds like a bunch of Hollywood people on power trips thinking they can push him around.
[02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:38.373]  And I guess because he suppressed it in the last month, his anger at it, that it exploded on this show.
[02:10:40.234 --> 02:10:43.455]  And you were trying to finish up dealing with the network and your view on that, Bob Chapman.
[02:10:45.091 --> 02:10:48.533]  Oh, I think they're just trying to get back at him, and it's going to cost them a lot of money.
[02:10:49.654 --> 02:10:56.537]  And it's foolish, willful, and Charlie is what he lit is, and they know that.
[02:10:57.098 --> 02:11:00.600]  And incidentally, he was a great baseball player when he was a kid.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:05.362]  And I think they've made a bad mistake.
[02:11:07.043 --> 02:11:08.324]  Everybody makes mistakes.
[02:11:09.182 --> 02:11:13.303]  And they should have said, well, clean your act up and come back and we'll get over this.
[02:11:13.404 --> 02:11:16.605]  But no, they took an aggressive position and they shouldn't have done that.
[02:11:17.985 --> 02:11:23.847]  You know, not everybody in life goes through life without having problems.
[02:11:24.067 --> 02:11:33.911]  And I don't think people can understand the tremendous pressure people in the movie industry are in and some other industries as well.
[02:11:34.651 --> 02:11:37.692]  And you have to take that into account.
[02:11:38.328 --> 02:11:41.050]  I mean, everywhere you go, they say, oh, there's Charlie.
[02:11:41.491 --> 02:11:42.752]  Can I talk to you, Charlie?
[02:11:42.872 --> 02:11:43.352]  Whatever.
[02:11:44.273 --> 02:11:45.594]  And that's pressure.
[02:11:46.275 --> 02:11:47.856]  Believe me.
[02:11:47.896 --> 02:11:49.337]  Their life isn't even their own.
[02:11:50.978 --> 02:11:54.621]  And so I think people should be easy on them.
[02:11:55.762 --> 02:11:59.205]  You know, we all have the potential of making mistakes.
[02:12:00.566 --> 02:12:01.347]  And I'll leave it at that.
[02:12:01.906 --> 02:12:03.046]  That's a good place to leave it.
[02:12:03.607 --> 02:12:06.167]  Let he without sin cast the first stone.
[02:12:06.187 --> 02:12:17.431]  I was gauging it yesterday and at a certain point I knew that we were getting into dangerous territory but I could either shut the interview down because there wasn't going to be any
[02:12:19.921 --> 02:12:43.477]  in a deep stopping charlie from what he was saying and i and i didn't really know you know what the outcome would be it may be a net good outcome uh... you know that he is basically he's told me privately and on air he said i'm tired by telling what to do everybody suppressing me the media exaggerating what i do me always giving giving giving giving giving and then being lied about and and he was outraged by lori being able to do this and so basically
[02:12:44.931 --> 02:12:46.893]  He just blew up on my show.
[02:12:48.114 --> 02:12:52.758]  And I mean, haven't we all blown up privately at home or at work ourselves and done some things?
[02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:54.820]  He just happened to do it here.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:58.603]  And you have to ask, you know, is it justified for him to be angry at Lori?
[02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:01.426]  And he's going through all this stress and is now detoxed.
[02:13:01.446 --> 02:13:03.187]  Can you imagine after a seven month party?
[02:13:03.207 --> 02:13:05.629]  You know, he's been clean now for just about a month.
[02:13:05.789 --> 02:13:07.951]  What he feels like right now, Bob?
[02:13:07.971 --> 02:13:12.255]  Well, emotionally, it's extremely difficult to handle.
[02:13:13.024 --> 02:13:17.248]  Because you've got to consider what got him into the situation he was in in the first place.
[02:13:17.768 --> 02:13:20.170]  And I saw lots of that, you know, going through life.
[02:13:21.131 --> 02:13:27.416]  Particularly during the 60s, 70s, 80s, when drugs were de grueur or alcohol or whatever.
[02:13:28.297 --> 02:13:30.338]  And we still see a hangover from it.
[02:13:31.339 --> 02:13:36.883]  There was tremendous loss of great people because of those episodes.
[02:13:37.644 --> 02:13:39.786]  And so, you know, cut the guy a little slack.
[02:13:42.239 --> 02:13:55.288]  Now, shifting gears into the wider world, what's happening with commodities, gold, silver, the weird glitch on the London Stock Exchange suffered a second embarrassing system glitch.
[02:13:55.308 --> 02:13:56.569]  That's when they're manipulating things.
[02:13:56.969 --> 02:13:58.950]  We'll talk about that thousand point drop from last year.
[02:13:58.970 --> 02:14:00.131]  Revisit that to tie it in.
[02:14:00.912 --> 02:14:07.936]  In a week on Friday, when UK share trading failed to start on time, angering clients keen on trades because of tension in Libya.
[02:14:08.437 --> 02:14:11.659]  And that's because they're doing manipulation behind the scenes before they launch it.
[02:14:12.819 --> 02:14:14.461]  Give us your take on that.
[02:14:14.581 --> 02:14:16.022]  Also, CNBC reporting, U.S.
[02:14:16.042 --> 02:14:19.204]  will be the world's third largest economy from number one.
[02:14:20.625 --> 02:14:22.386]  What's happening in Libya?
[02:14:24.548 --> 02:14:30.251]  Medvedev, the president of Russia, saying this could go on for years and could drive up oil prices.
[02:14:30.332 --> 02:14:37.737]  NATO openly talking about now in a U.N.-U.S.-NATO-led invasion of Libya.
[02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:41.299]  Uh, and the type of weapons that Muammar Gaddafi has.
[02:14:41.739 --> 02:14:44.340]  Bob Chavin, you've got the floor for the next six minutes before we got a break.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.841]  Give us your geopolitical view on all of this.
[02:14:48.162 --> 02:14:52.164]  Well, I think in Libya, you've got, you're right back to a tribal situation.
[02:14:53.044 --> 02:15:04.510]  And, you know, most people overlook this, uh, uh, but you got it all over the world, not only in Africa and, and, but you got it in Europe, uh, and, and places, other places in the world.
[02:15:05.385 --> 02:15:17.330]  And these are probably animosities that have been below the surface for many years, and now Mr. Gaddafi's under pressure to get out, and they're taking advantage of it.
[02:15:18.591 --> 02:15:29.715]  The Russians, they have a reason to gloat over this, because if oil prices are high, they make lots more money, and so you can understand, in part, where they might be coming from.
[02:15:30.776 --> 02:15:34.117]  And no, I don't think that's going to go on for years and years.
[02:15:35.569 --> 02:15:42.554]  I think the changes will come about over the next couple of years in all of those countries, whatever is going to happen.
[02:15:43.494 --> 02:15:55.561]  And having the NATO or UN or whoever it is go in to settle things in Libya, I really don't think that's a good idea.
[02:15:59.484 --> 02:16:04.487]  If people are trapped in there that are Americans or British or whatever,
[02:16:04.983 --> 02:16:05.884]  And they can't get out.
[02:16:06.524 --> 02:16:10.946]  Sending people in, you know, your military in might be a good idea.
[02:16:13.548 --> 02:16:15.649]  Sometimes he who hesitates is lost.
[02:16:16.769 --> 02:16:19.351]  And I think, you know, it's something that's on the table.
[02:16:20.351 --> 02:16:25.514]  And I'm sure that in Washington and the Pentagon, they're talking a great deal about it.
[02:16:26.855 --> 02:16:29.856]  And, you know, Qaddafi wants to stay.
[02:16:29.896 --> 02:16:31.377]  He wants to increase wages 150 percent.
[02:16:35.294 --> 02:16:38.336]  Which would be $400 a family or something like that.
[02:16:38.676 --> 02:16:40.257]  But this is ex post facto.
[02:16:41.297 --> 02:16:42.458]  The damage has been done.
[02:16:42.958 --> 02:16:44.879]  He's bombing and strafing his own people.
[02:16:44.899 --> 02:16:49.421]  I mean, these are not people who are engaged in warfare against him.
[02:16:49.862 --> 02:16:54.464]  These are people like you and I and our kids and grandkids.
[02:16:54.564 --> 02:16:56.525]  And he should have never done that.
[02:16:57.605 --> 02:16:58.386]  The guy's got to go.
[02:16:59.518 --> 02:17:03.341]  And, uh, spending the money that belongs to them to shut them up.
[02:17:03.401 --> 02:17:04.462]  It's not the right thing to do.
[02:17:04.502 --> 02:17:06.164]  Yeah, I mean, he's been there 42 years.
[02:17:06.664 --> 02:17:23.078]  My issue is, how do we have a thousand drones bombing people and saying they can kill 200 to get one bad guy, and that's acceptable, but then sit there and moralize... I mean, we can moralize on it, because we're not doing it, but, you know, the globalists moralize about Qaddafi strafing people when that's exactly what the globalists do.
[02:17:24.119 --> 02:17:25.260]  Well, you're right about that.
[02:17:26.008 --> 02:17:28.368]  And it's a very good point to bring up.
[02:17:28.909 --> 02:17:32.789]  It just shows you that the globalists are every bit as bad as Gaddafi is.
[02:17:34.290 --> 02:17:35.710]  Let that sink in, everybody.
[02:17:36.270 --> 02:17:38.190]  Bob, where do you expect it to go in Libya?
[02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:43.791]  Oh, I think you're going to see outside forces go in, probably the United States.
[02:17:45.331 --> 02:17:53.813]  And I think that part of this whole thing that has happened throughout the area, region we'll call it,
[02:17:54.921 --> 02:18:21.489]  is to keep things in political and social turmoil and the reason for that is that sooner or later the people behind the scenes will have the United States and perhaps probably Israel move against Iran and they don't want any competition and you can neutralize competition by having everybody upset with a new government or a new compromise government or
[02:18:23.239 --> 02:18:26.440]  A government in each country that's been cobbled together.
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:38.882]  And they're not going to be in a position, even if they're pro-Iranian or anti, to act in relation to something that happens in Iran.
[02:18:40.402 --> 02:18:41.582]  And the U.S.
[02:18:41.622 --> 02:18:44.263]  hasn't given up, nor Israel.
[02:18:45.103 --> 02:18:50.924]  They've not given up the hope that they can go in there and neutralize Iran.
[02:18:52.514 --> 02:18:55.136]  It's obvious that that's what they want to do.
[02:18:55.216 --> 02:19:05.144]  And this could be a stepping stone by having all of this unruliness going on where no one can go and aid Iran.
[02:19:05.164 --> 02:19:09.728]  And you know, there are states that the Iranians don't like, such as Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:11.069 --> 02:19:16.313]  And that enters into it as well.
[02:19:17.153 --> 02:19:20.136]  But I think it's going to go on for a while.
[02:19:21.152 --> 02:19:22.333]  Several months, probably.
[02:19:23.333 --> 02:19:24.914]  But I don't think it's going to last for years.
[02:19:24.954 --> 02:19:26.135]  I think the Russians are wrong.
[02:19:27.435 --> 02:19:31.417]  Although they're pretty good at counterintelligence.
[02:19:31.497 --> 02:19:32.598]  I know I worked against them.
[02:19:34.322 --> 02:19:39.725]  But Bob, the globalist program, according to Brzezinski and others, is to have this go on for years.
[02:19:39.765 --> 02:19:43.607]  That's what Lindsey Williams is saying is planned, with a domino effect.
[02:19:43.647 --> 02:19:45.588]  But you're saying you don't see that happen.
[02:19:45.608 --> 02:19:54.392]  I want to throw out at you a few of the things that Lindsey Williams said that his sources told him earlier this week, and get your view on that.
[02:19:54.432 --> 02:19:59.414]  Then I want to talk about what's happening in the stock market, gold, silver, a lot more, where you see the world economy going.
[02:19:59.954 --> 02:20:00.715]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.099 --> 02:20:05.041]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.

[02:21:30.496 --> 02:21:31.577]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.737 --> 02:21:36.120]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:42.004]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:42.124 --> 02:21:45.526]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.766 --> 02:21:48.368]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.588 --> 02:21:53.391]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.531 --> 02:21:53.772]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.832 --> 02:21:55.173]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.596 --> 02:22:01.737]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:22:01.777 --> 02:22:08.480]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:11.041]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:22:11.301 --> 02:22:16.524]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:22:16.704 --> 02:22:19.505]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:22:19.665 --> 02:22:21.726]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:22:21.986 --> 02:22:27.948]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:22:28.269 --> 02:22:31.470]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:22:31.650 --> 02:22:37.212]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:22:37.472 --> 02:22:38.793]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:22:39.113 --> 02:22:40.353]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:22:40.433 --> 02:22:42.974]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:22:43.114 --> 02:22:44.535]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:22:44.795 --> 02:22:47.176]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:22:47.357 --> 02:22:51.779]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[02:24:01.744 --> 02:24:03.985]  Suckin' the children's blood!
[02:24:30.285 --> 02:24:31.446]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:24:31.506 --> 02:24:32.327]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:32.347 --> 02:24:35.029]  We'll be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., Lord willing.
[02:24:36.690 --> 02:24:52.102]  Bob, getting into what's happening in the stock markets, the merger or the takeover by the Germans and the EU of the New York Stock Exchange, Max Keiser says that's so they can engage in more behind-the-scenes fraud and manipulation and not get caught.
[02:24:52.583 --> 02:24:55.525]  London Stock Exchange hit by technical glitch.
[02:24:55.905 --> 02:24:57.487]  What's your view on all this going on?
[02:24:58.766 --> 02:25:02.707]  Well, I think Max, first of all, is right about that.
[02:25:04.428 --> 02:25:15.750]  The Germans were after the derivatives business because, quite frankly, I think they want to control it, but I think they want to clean it up as well.
[02:25:17.311 --> 02:25:20.232]  It's something that could bring down the whole financial system very easily.
[02:25:21.492 --> 02:25:24.973]  Also, I see the merging of these different exchanges
[02:25:26.002 --> 02:25:31.365]  As a ultimate move toward one eventual major exchange.
[02:25:32.145 --> 02:25:34.826]  And so, I think that's where they're headed with this.
[02:25:35.727 --> 02:25:42.250]  The New York Stock Exchange, because of electronic trading, had become anachronistic.
[02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:47.492]  And the best part of it was the derivatives, and that's what they were after.
[02:25:48.572 --> 02:25:53.115]  As far as these non-openings, your take is right.
[02:25:53.155 --> 02:25:53.935]  They probably
[02:25:54.614 --> 02:26:00.135]  We're making sure that they protected themselves before they opened the market up.
[02:26:00.575 --> 02:26:06.656]  Markets players in England are much closer to one another than they are in the United States.
[02:26:07.956 --> 02:26:13.197]  That's more of a fraternity than a competing situation.
[02:26:13.237 --> 02:26:16.778]  I did a lot of business in London over the years when I was a broker.
[02:26:16.798 --> 02:26:22.179]  In fact, it was one of the main places I did business for about 15 years.
[02:26:24.775 --> 02:26:32.877]  Until they had the Soweto riots in South Africa in August of 75.
[02:26:33.997 --> 02:26:37.258]  I knew from then on out there was going to be real trouble in South Africa.
[02:26:37.798 --> 02:26:41.739]  And so I switched over mostly to North American mining stocks.
[02:26:42.199 --> 02:26:46.340]  But the point is that, yes, those things happen.
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:47.680]  They do what they want to do.
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:49.680]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:51.761]  And, you know, you see the
[02:26:53.179 --> 02:26:54.220]  Let me just back up.
[02:27:14.864 --> 02:27:17.046]  Let me just back up something you said earlier.
[02:27:17.086 --> 02:27:27.653]  We forget that Merkel went absolutely ape just last year and said, it's the big private central banks.
[02:27:27.873 --> 02:27:28.954]  They are criminal.
[02:27:29.314 --> 02:27:33.777]  We've got to do something about them or they're going to bring down the entire financial system.
[02:27:33.797 --> 02:27:35.038]  So there's even infighting.
[02:27:35.378 --> 02:27:36.879]  And that really backs up what you're saying.
[02:27:36.899 --> 02:27:41.943]  The Germans have not been engaged in as much as this as the US, Britain and others.
[02:27:42.643 --> 02:27:45.985]  And, you know, the Germans actually want to build an economy.
[02:27:46.005 --> 02:27:47.366]  They actually want to have factories.
[02:27:47.406 --> 02:27:48.267]  They want to have jobs.
[02:27:48.607 --> 02:27:56.793]  Why has Germany followed a different path, though they are the heart of the EU, than the deindustrialization campaign in England and the US?
[02:27:58.534 --> 02:28:07.160]  Well, I think the major reason is that it's a complex that they received after having been in World War II.
[02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:11.743]  And I lived in Germany for a long time, and I speak German.
[02:28:12.825 --> 02:28:14.946]  And not as good as I used to.
[02:28:15.706 --> 02:28:21.829]  And I really understand deeply the people in Germany as an outsider.
[02:28:22.189 --> 02:28:23.609]  And I lived all over Germany.
[02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:29.172]  And I think Merkel may have put her foot in the mouth when she said that.
[02:28:29.792 --> 02:28:35.034]  And then just recently, she said, well, Germany is going to save the euro no matter what.
[02:28:35.874 --> 02:28:42.317]  And then a couple of days later, the Chinese come in and bought some bonds from Greece, Portugal and Spain.
[02:28:43.553 --> 02:28:54.819]  And then, the Germans have devoted the largest part of the amount of money, which is about a trillion dollars, to bail out the six countries that got problems.
[02:28:55.319 --> 02:29:00.662]  Well, they knew from the very beginning, and I wrote about it, that the bill was going to be three to five trillion.
[02:29:01.422 --> 02:29:05.444]  And so, she says, well, we're going to save the Eurozone.
[02:29:06.044 --> 02:29:11.427]  Well, they just had an election last weekend, and her constituency,
[02:29:12.225 --> 02:29:17.749]  Originally in the Hamburg area, the wealthiest area of Germany, that state had their elections.
[02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:25.195]  And the CDU, which is the Christian Democratic Union, which is her party, got bombed.
[02:29:26.456 --> 02:29:27.397]  Why did they get bombed?
[02:29:27.677 --> 02:29:31.680]  They don't want to give any more money to these people who they think
[02:29:32.356 --> 02:29:34.838]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.878 --> 02:29:36.519]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.198 --> 02:30:04.660]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:30:05.020 --> 02:30:09.063]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:30:09.303 --> 02:30:14.146]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:30:14.206 --> 02:30:19.169]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:30:19.949 --> 02:30:23.151]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:30:23.191 --> 02:30:26.973]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:34.122]  I'm looking for America.
[02:30:35.262 --> 02:30:36.703]  We're American and be proud.
[02:30:36.883 --> 02:30:39.323]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:30:39.343 --> 02:30:43.665]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[02:30:44.125 --> 02:30:46.726]  Seems like I just woke up one day.
[02:30:55.686 --> 02:31:00.258]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:31:00.882 --> 02:31:05.125]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.425 --> 02:31:06.045]  Number one.
[02:31:06.345 --> 02:31:09.507]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.768 --> 02:31:10.348]  Number two.
[02:31:10.628 --> 02:31:15.191]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.531 --> 02:31:15.972]  It's true.
[02:31:16.272 --> 02:31:20.835]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.135 --> 02:31:21.695]  Number three.
[02:31:21.975 --> 02:31:25.257]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.558 --> 02:31:29.240]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:30.001]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.241 --> 02:31:32.603]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.003 --> 02:31:36.387]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:36.907]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.488 --> 02:31:41.411]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.631 --> 02:31:46.396]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:22.146 --> 02:32:24.488]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:32:24.808 --> 02:32:31.014]  Since 1947, Calvin's Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:32:31.315 --> 02:32:32.716]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:32:54.181 --> 02:32:54.621]  Thank you!
[02:33:26.223 --> 02:33:27.885]  We're here talking about the state of the world.
[02:33:27.985 --> 02:33:32.109]  Obviously, things are heating up and getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[02:33:32.449 --> 02:33:39.916]  Looking at gold, looking at silver, looking at other commodities, looking at mortgage gate that is continuing to explode.
[02:33:40.577 --> 02:33:44.200]  There's no doubt this debt black hole that the globalists have created is impossible to pay back.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:44.921]  We don't owe it.
[02:33:45.642 --> 02:33:48.444]  Break down where we are currently in the economy.
[02:33:49.165 --> 02:34:01.212]  And then, looking forward, your forecast for the euro, for the dollar, these moves towards dollar devaluation, commodities prices going up, food prices going up, spurring more rebellion worldwide.
[02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:02.793]  Bob, you've got the floor.
[02:34:03.073 --> 02:34:03.953]  Give us an analysis.
[02:34:03.993 --> 02:34:04.774]  Break it down for us.
[02:34:05.474 --> 02:34:17.721]  Well, I think the dollar, with the USDX, which is six other major currencies versus the dollar, and one of those is the euro, I think you're going to see the dollar go up and down.
[02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:26.866]  Um, up when the stock markets up or when things are going relatively good, at least for a short period of time.
[02:34:27.307 --> 02:34:34.850]  And then all of a sudden you'll have a problem, uh, perhaps with, uh, Greece or Ireland or Portugal or whatever.
[02:34:35.391 --> 02:34:38.752]  And then the, the, the year will go to go back down again.
[02:34:39.053 --> 02:34:41.834]  And then that is the most heavily weighted in the USDX.
[02:34:42.274 --> 02:34:44.315]  It's around 57% of the total.
[02:34:45.056 --> 02:34:47.017]  And so it's going to be a,
[02:34:48.032 --> 02:34:55.638]  Up and down wobbly year, although I think the dollar will tend to be lower than it is and has been recently.
[02:34:57.199 --> 02:34:58.721]  As far as the U.S.
[02:34:58.761 --> 02:35:04.725]  economy is concerned, I was looking for 2 to 2.25% growth this year.
[02:35:05.366 --> 02:35:08.348]  They just came out with new figures for last year today.
[02:35:09.189 --> 02:35:11.111]  They said the economy grew 2.8%, and that included
[02:35:13.846 --> 02:35:22.630]  $2.5 trillion combination of stimulus and what the Fed Reserve made up out of thin air, which is $1.7 trillion of that.
[02:35:23.250 --> 02:35:29.153]  We're going through the same thing again, only I call it the law of diminishing returns.
[02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:34.955]  You throw money at things and it works, but the next time you do it, it doesn't work as well.
[02:35:35.755 --> 02:35:41.538]  And so we're going for 2.8% growth with all that stimulus of one form or another.
[02:35:42.148 --> 02:35:49.633]  Down to two to two and a quarter, but we now have oil selling at much higher prices than it was previously.
[02:35:50.093 --> 02:35:53.855]  When I made that estimate, oil was selling for around $70.
[02:35:54.676 --> 02:36:11.666]  And so if we're going to persistently have problems in the Middle East, and let's say that oil for the next six months stays at $100 a barrel, or even for a year, it's going to cost the American taxpayer
[02:36:12.765 --> 02:36:22.367]  The consumer, about $150 billion, which cannot go into buying things in the American economy.
[02:36:23.087 --> 02:36:28.768]  The money's going to go out to others who we buy 65% of our oil from.
[02:36:29.628 --> 02:36:31.469]  And so that's going to be a drag on the economy.
[02:36:31.549 --> 02:36:40.111]  So my figures might have to be adjusted back to one and a quarter to one and a half or one and three quarters percent, somewhere in that vicinity.
[02:36:40.131 --> 02:36:42.331]  And that's not very good.
[02:36:43.749 --> 02:37:03.613]  That means if we have the persistence of higher oil prices in particular, and I didn't even mention higher food prices, which I think we're going to have much higher food prices going up for the next one to two years, then the economy is not going to grow as well.
[02:37:03.893 --> 02:37:05.193]  The figures might even be lower.
[02:37:06.273 --> 02:37:07.834]  We have some unknowns out there.
[02:37:08.574 --> 02:37:09.854]  So I think that
[02:37:11.502 --> 02:37:13.703]  The American economy is going to flounder.
[02:37:14.964 --> 02:37:19.006]  Last May in this program, I said we're going to have QE2 and QE3 and maybe more.
[02:37:19.946 --> 02:37:31.752]  And I think QE3 is going to be on people's lips in Washington and Wall Street, probably starting in July or August, like it did last year.
[02:37:31.772 --> 02:37:33.353]  And I think we're going to get it.
[02:37:33.874 --> 02:37:40.477]  And the reason why is because of the relative failure of the economy
[02:37:41.024 --> 02:37:48.927]  Because of perhaps outside influences, such as higher prices on petroleum products and food.
[02:37:50.028 --> 02:37:57.191]  And they'll be justified in doing it, at least the public will think that they are, when in fact they really aren't.
[02:37:57.251 --> 02:38:00.192]  But that's another whole area to get into.
[02:38:01.052 --> 02:38:06.675]  And so, in order to keep the system going, they've got to keep interest rates where they are, officially.
[02:38:07.935 --> 02:38:09.656]  And they have to have QE3.
[02:38:11.327 --> 02:38:21.512]  And they're also going to have to deal with the domestic problem of the municipalities and the states.
[02:38:22.353 --> 02:38:29.957]  I mean, in California, Jerry Brown went to his fellow Democrats and said, well, let's clean this mess up.
[02:38:30.597 --> 02:38:31.217]  And they said, no.
[02:38:32.878 --> 02:38:35.699]  So and now he's going to have to take unilateral action.
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:39.882]  This is the kind of thing that people in government are running into.
[02:38:40.122 --> 02:38:40.662]  And you see it
[02:38:41.718 --> 02:38:46.959]  In Wisconsin, in Indiana, in Ohio, and you'll see more of it.
[02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:51.781]  People don't want to give anything up, but the bills have to be paid.
[02:38:52.561 --> 02:38:53.821]  And something's got to be done.
[02:38:54.682 --> 02:39:00.123]  And so you have this internal problem, and it's going to lean toward layoffs.
[02:39:01.403 --> 02:39:05.365]  And that means that employment can't really get a whole lot better, if at all.
[02:39:06.905 --> 02:39:10.306]  So, you may have a sideways movement in the economy,
[02:39:11.977 --> 02:39:14.979]  But it made me what they used to call profitless prosperity.
[02:39:16.239 --> 02:39:18.520]  And that's where I think the economy is leading.
[02:39:18.921 --> 02:39:21.982]  And we're going to have real inflation this year.
[02:39:23.283 --> 02:39:25.104]  Especially the second half of the year.
[02:39:25.384 --> 02:39:26.344]  Well, we're already seeing that.
[02:39:26.384 --> 02:39:28.405]  You forecasted that years ago.
[02:39:28.465 --> 02:39:32.387]  You called 2011 is when we'd really see it ramp up.
[02:39:32.787 --> 02:39:34.068]  But I mean, where does this lead?
[02:39:36.069 --> 02:39:39.991]  Well, it could lead to hyperinflation because I'm looking for an increase of 7% from 7%
[02:39:42.648 --> 02:39:48.811]  Where we're at in real inflation right now, and that's a middling figure from private economists.
[02:39:48.831 --> 02:39:52.953]  Some of them are, like John Williams, has got two figures.
[02:39:53.033 --> 02:39:54.794]  One is 5.75 and the other is 9.25.
[02:39:55.014 --> 02:39:58.555]  And we're going to 14% this year.
[02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:04.858]  And if they have QE3 and the same thing that they've been doing before, you're not going to have hardly any growth at all.
[02:40:05.018 --> 02:40:10.801]  And at the same time, you're going to have stagflation, which is stagnation with inflation.
[02:40:11.405 --> 02:40:12.146]  And what will it be?
[02:40:12.667 --> 02:40:14.550]  Could be 20%, could be 25%.
[02:40:14.951 --> 02:40:16.293]  We don't know until we get there.
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:30.582]  Now I want to get into Lindsey Williams and his predictions, not even predictions, what Ken Fromm told him and then what the other living former oil CEO told him just earlier this week.
[02:40:31.362 --> 02:40:32.562]  He broke that news here.
[02:40:32.642 --> 02:40:36.823]  He did say four months ago in October, look for the Middle East to be destabilized and blow up.
[02:40:37.303 --> 02:40:41.764]  Look for oil prices to go to $150, $200 a barrel within six months to a year.
[02:40:43.244 --> 02:40:46.885]  And basically look for the death of the dollar at the end of 2012 is what his
[02:40:47.585 --> 02:40:50.907]  Well, I think that it's possible, particularly if we have a war with Iran.
[02:40:50.927 --> 02:40:51.527]  I mean, it's a given.
[02:40:51.587 --> 02:40:57.790]  We don't know what's going to happen in between, like the Russians and Lindsey say, well, we're going to have continual
[02:41:17.348 --> 02:41:23.593]  Boiling social and political problems, maybe military problems in the Middle East for some time to come.
[02:41:23.613 --> 02:41:28.836]  I don't know that that is going to continue that badly.
[02:41:28.856 --> 02:41:32.239]  I mean, these people, they want to eat.
[02:41:32.259 --> 02:41:36.562]  They're not generally interested in warfare.
[02:41:37.802 --> 02:41:43.506]  And so I would think they'll all try to get their acts together and to varying degrees.
[02:41:44.607 --> 02:41:45.628]  Six months to a year.
[02:41:46.457 --> 02:41:48.038]  Things could calm down.
[02:41:49.299 --> 02:42:00.088]  Which leads one to believe, if I'm right, maybe this coming summer might be the time the United States decides that they want to curtail what Iran's doing.
[02:42:01.268 --> 02:42:07.493]  I always, in the back of my mind, think of what's happened in the past.
[02:42:08.294 --> 02:42:11.857]  And every time governments get in trouble, they have a war.
[02:42:13.058 --> 02:42:15.399]  And that's how I was able to predict something like 9-11.
[02:42:16.713 --> 02:42:18.954]  And the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:42:20.115 --> 02:42:29.278]  And there's a good chance that finally, after everybody's been talking about it for a long time, we may have the United States go into Iran.
[02:42:30.299 --> 02:42:37.042]  And that certainly could make oil go to $120, $150, maybe even $200 a barrel.
[02:42:37.422 --> 02:42:38.002]  We don't know.
[02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:39.763]  The possibility exists.
[02:42:40.843 --> 02:42:42.464]  It could be a very volatile region.
[02:42:43.524 --> 02:42:45.045]  Because the United States wants it to be.
[02:42:46.750 --> 02:42:50.433]  And how about all the countries that are trying to change government?
[02:42:51.294 --> 02:42:52.695]  We don't know how long it will take.
[02:42:54.797 --> 02:42:56.999]  And so, there's big question marks there.
[02:42:57.379 --> 02:43:00.502]  But the possibility of higher oil prices are very good.
[02:43:00.982 --> 02:43:02.624]  The probability, we can't say yet.
[02:43:05.925 --> 02:43:08.926]  I want to shift gears now specifically into gold and silver.
[02:43:09.107 --> 02:43:13.068]  I mean, if you look at the 11, 10-year graph, it's only going straight up.
[02:43:13.088 --> 02:43:17.090]  In fact, let's put the 11 or 10-year graph up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:23.233]  Radio listeners, just search the term 10-year, or now it's been 11, 11-year gold graph.
[02:43:23.353 --> 02:43:24.354]  And it's going straight up.
[02:43:24.774 --> 02:43:27.095]  But on the way up, there's little dips.
[02:43:27.855 --> 02:43:31.057]  And the general public's been put in this weekly or monthly view.
[02:43:31.917 --> 02:43:39.224]  That every time gold or silver drops a little before racing back up, always getting new heights, they're saying, it's over, it's over for gold and silver.
[02:43:39.264 --> 02:43:45.570]  But then you look at all the fundamentals, gold and silver should only go up with global currency devaluations led by the dollar.
[02:43:46.891 --> 02:43:49.133]  And, you know, now we've seen a giant explosion.
[02:43:49.153 --> 02:43:52.956]  You can give us the actual numbers in the last, what, week or two in gold and silver.
[02:43:54.196 --> 02:43:54.617]  I don't
[02:44:16.490 --> 02:44:20.873]  I mean, it's like you're right and then you're wrong because you're right.
[02:44:21.193 --> 02:44:25.497]  Because I guess people don't want to admit they were wrong to not buy gold and silver, Bob.
[02:44:26.357 --> 02:44:28.599]  You capsulized it.
[02:44:28.619 --> 02:44:33.223]  And, you know, I've been doing the gold and silver genre for over 50 years.
[02:44:34.304 --> 02:44:40.508]  And as you pointed out earlier, I was the top stockbroker in gold and silver shares for 28 years, almost 29 years.
[02:44:45.589 --> 02:44:48.310]  Bull markets always climb a wall of worry.
[02:44:49.691 --> 02:44:53.633]  And anybody can have their own opinion, and that's okay.
[02:44:54.634 --> 02:44:59.977]  Whether it's on the street corner talking to somebody or on a program on radio.
[02:45:01.737 --> 02:45:06.000]  But there's very few people who come on who are real professionals in this field.
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:07.000]  And I am.
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:12.343]  And I know, and I knew in 2000, where this was headed.
[02:45:13.459 --> 02:45:16.081]  And the subscribers of The Forecaster have been long.
[02:45:16.601 --> 02:45:23.746]  Gold and silver, since silver was $3.80 and gold was $252 an ounce.
[02:45:24.726 --> 02:45:26.828]  And they've kept their assets together.
[02:45:27.308 --> 02:45:28.349]  They've been protected.
[02:45:29.529 --> 02:45:33.292]  And they've probably, some of them, made enormous amounts of money already.
[02:45:34.213 --> 02:45:36.694]  And I got people out of the real estate market as well.
[02:45:37.214 --> 02:45:39.256]  I got them out of the stock market twice.
[02:45:39.986 --> 02:45:41.586]  Before they went down precipitously.
[02:45:41.666 --> 02:45:43.487]  And that's why the globalists have persecuted you?
[02:45:44.807 --> 02:45:48.508]  Well, they've been persecuting me since 1967.
[02:45:48.828 --> 02:45:49.629]  You get used to it.
[02:45:50.249 --> 02:45:54.410]  But, and I don't worry about that because I'm too old to worry about it.
[02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:57.211]  Well Bob, where do you see gold and silver going?
[02:45:57.231 --> 02:46:00.252]  Because I want to bring Ted Anderson in right now.
[02:46:00.352 --> 02:46:02.872]  Ted, 30 plus years in gold and silver business.
[02:46:03.593 --> 02:46:04.933]  Ted, where do you see it going?
[02:46:05.629 --> 02:46:07.791]  Well, I can tell you right now I'm watching this market.
[02:46:07.851 --> 02:46:15.356]  I mean, we're looking right now at a high of $33.23 an ounce today in silver, $14.1280 in gold.
[02:46:16.277 --> 02:46:17.658]  The market is hot, Alex.
[02:46:17.718 --> 02:46:20.520]  I'm looking at the gas prices here in Minnesota now.
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:23.462]  We're at about $3.32 per gallon.
[02:46:23.522 --> 02:46:24.343]  I mean, come on!
[02:46:25.824 --> 02:46:26.904]  It's just, you know...
[02:46:27.985 --> 02:46:31.088]  Then you have this Middle East thing cracking down like it is.
[02:46:31.188 --> 02:46:39.677]  I mean, I would not be surprised to see gold over $1,600 an ounce, and it certainly wouldn't surprise me to see silver over $40 an ounce.
[02:46:40.057 --> 02:46:47.584]  I mean, you know, it wouldn't take but just a little bit of a week-long movement to look at $39 an ounce silver.
[02:46:48.045 --> 02:46:48.846]  It's just that...
[02:46:49.446 --> 02:46:50.707]  That's the way it is now.
[02:46:50.807 --> 02:46:52.908]  I mean, it's building momentum.
[02:46:52.948 --> 02:47:03.632]  And yes, indeed, there's a lot of pressure from, you know, the powers above government that are trying to suppress the prices because their game is to keep people on paper money.
[02:47:03.892 --> 02:47:05.193]  They want to support this thing.
[02:47:05.233 --> 02:47:09.475]  But my, you know, like you say, it's like holding a beach ball underwater.
[02:47:09.515 --> 02:47:13.096]  Eventually it gets out of their hands and it comes popping up even further.
[02:47:13.357 --> 02:47:14.317]  And that's what's going on.
[02:47:14.557 --> 02:47:15.898]  The value of the dollar is falling.
[02:47:16.158 --> 02:47:17.959]  The value of silver and gold is rising.
[02:47:18.359 --> 02:47:18.659]  I mean, the
[02:47:20.059 --> 02:47:26.262]  I'm just excited to no end that we have sold as many of your videos with the silver dollar deal that we have.
[02:47:26.542 --> 02:47:29.963]  I mean, it's just, you know, that's getting the information in the people's hands.
[02:47:30.283 --> 02:47:32.184]  It's also getting silver dollars in the people's hands.
[02:47:32.204 --> 02:47:34.685]  Yeah, I mean, I have to say, support the network, support Midas.
[02:47:34.805 --> 02:47:36.446]  It's just, you know, sister to it.
[02:47:36.746 --> 02:47:39.287]  But quite frankly, Ted, I know that you're actually losing money.
[02:47:39.987 --> 02:47:52.812]  On this silver deal, and this was the deal you came up with, but I mean when I say on air that Ted does this as a loss leader so that you'll get introduced to silver and gold, you get three silver dollars.
[02:47:54.073 --> 02:48:15.325]  For $97, and that's basically at spot or even below it, correct me if I'm wrong, and then you get free shipping, a $6 or $7 value, I guess after handling it's about a $10 value, and then three of my films, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, three separate DVDs, cover case, everything, that's over a $70 value, free,
[02:48:18.567 --> 02:48:21.728]  And getting a smoking deal on silver coins.
[02:48:22.088 --> 02:48:23.588]  What type of silver coins are they, Ted?
[02:48:23.748 --> 02:48:33.330]  Well, these are the old silver dollars that were commissioned by the United States government back in 1776 to be used as money here in the United States.
[02:48:33.690 --> 02:48:34.790]  It's the last issue.
[02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:44.853]  They call it the Peace Dollar Series, which came out right after World War I to commemorate the end of all wars and to have the peace time.
[02:48:45.233 --> 02:48:46.653]  Obviously a big joke, but
[02:48:47.333 --> 02:48:49.534]  Nonetheless, this is constitutional money.
[02:48:49.794 --> 02:48:53.997]  These are the real silver dollars that were used here in the United States for money.
[02:48:54.017 --> 02:48:59.360]  Yeah, so they, correct me if I'm wrong, they do, you wouldn't call them fully numismatic, but don't they have a collector value?
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:00.100]  They sure do.
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:01.161]  Okay, so that's even better.
[02:49:01.401 --> 02:49:04.903]  Bob Chapman, let me just ask you, how good of a deal is that that Ted just offered?
[02:49:05.583 --> 02:49:06.223]  It's excellent.
[02:49:06.844 --> 02:49:07.564]  It's very good.
[02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:12.847]  And it's one of the ways to invest in silver.
[02:49:12.987 --> 02:49:16.669]  And everybody out there knows what a silver dollar is.
[02:49:17.449 --> 02:49:28.177]  And so if someday you have to spend it, rather than turn it into a dealer and get cash for it to go buy something, if you're forced to use it for barter, everybody knows what it is.
[02:49:28.617 --> 02:49:34.721]  And the same thing is true with the pre-64 90% dimes, quarters, and halves.
[02:49:35.582 --> 02:49:36.362]  Same situation.
[02:49:36.422 --> 02:49:37.583]  Everybody knows what they are.
[02:49:38.104 --> 02:49:39.545]  And let's give folks the numbers.
[02:49:39.685 --> 02:49:40.565]  Gold is up $6.90, $1,409.00.
[02:49:40.665 --> 02:49:41.446]  Where's silver today?
[02:49:47.712 --> 02:49:51.333]  Silver right now, presently, just let me look at it real quick here.
[02:49:51.353 --> 02:49:51.333]  $33.22.
[02:49:51.674 --> 02:49:54.415]  Sina, how did he have $33.23?
[02:49:54.855 --> 02:50:00.897]  So more than $99 for you to buy those coins at spot, and you can't do that pretty much anywhere.
[02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:02.858]  Ted bought these when they were a little bit lower.
[02:50:03.338 --> 02:50:05.159]  That's how he can give you this deal, but there's...
[02:50:05.939 --> 02:50:07.621]  Well, is there any profit?
[02:50:07.641 --> 02:50:10.063]  In fact, Ted, there's no profit in this deal for you, is there?
[02:50:10.103 --> 02:50:11.324]  No, no, we're losing money.
[02:50:11.364 --> 02:50:13.727]  As a matter of fact, my traders are telling me that I'm nuts.
[02:50:14.527 --> 02:50:16.669]  I'm going to just carry this deal through Monday.
[02:50:17.070 --> 02:50:19.592]  If I still have silver at $33 plus an ounce,
[02:50:21.494 --> 02:50:23.176]  I'm not going to be able to offer this to anyone.
[02:50:43.516 --> 02:50:44.557]  Frank Sovereigns.
[02:50:44.597 --> 02:50:47.598]  They've got a whole list of the radio specials.
[02:50:47.678 --> 02:50:48.218]  Ask them for that.
[02:50:48.238 --> 02:50:49.079]  800-686-2237 or MinusResources.com.
[02:50:49.479 --> 02:50:52.540]  We'll be right back with some final points with Bob Chapman.

[02:52:00.931 --> 02:52:02.092]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:52:02.112 --> 02:52:08.816]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:52:09.076 --> 02:52:11.377]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:11.658 --> 02:52:16.881]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:52:17.061 --> 02:52:19.863]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:20.003 --> 02:52:22.084]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:52:22.324 --> 02:52:28.287]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:28.607 --> 02:52:31.828]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:32.008 --> 02:52:37.571]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:37.811 --> 02:52:39.131]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:39.472 --> 02:52:40.652]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:52:40.772 --> 02:52:43.333]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:52:43.453 --> 02:52:44.874]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:52:45.094 --> 02:52:45.515]  We're good to go.
[02:53:00.706 --> 02:53:03.969]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:09.034]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:53:09.294 --> 02:53:15.220]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:53:15.460 --> 02:53:17.602]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:53:17.882 --> 02:53:23.868]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:53:23.968 --> 02:53:27.312]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:53:27.372 --> 02:53:29.075]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:53:29.255 --> 02:53:31.298]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:54:09.568 --> 02:54:13.190]  Everybody knows that the tanks are loaded.
[02:54:13.230 --> 02:54:17.973]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[02:54:18.774 --> 02:54:22.636]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[02:54:23.376 --> 02:54:26.879]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:38.282]  We'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:38.442 --> 02:54:39.842]  Lord willing, on Monday as well.
[02:54:40.983 --> 02:54:45.724]  I've got a bunch of national media wanting to fly me out to different events to be in studio.
[02:54:45.764 --> 02:54:47.124]  I don't normally do that.
[02:54:47.645 --> 02:54:50.405]  Some of these shows are so big, though, they don't have satellite interviews.
[02:54:51.025 --> 02:54:51.786]  There are only a few of them.
[02:54:51.806 --> 02:54:55.407]  You can probably put your minds together and figure that out.
[02:54:55.487 --> 02:54:56.307]  I don't even want to do it.
[02:54:58.342 --> 02:55:06.971]  But I'll probably end up doing it because I like to step up to the plate, just like Bob Chapman's done for 45 years fighting the New World Order.
[02:55:07.311 --> 02:55:11.556]  Bob, in summation, how do you think things are going for the globalists these days?
[02:55:13.337 --> 02:55:14.799]  I think it's mixed.
[02:55:15.119 --> 02:55:18.563]  I think that things have happened in the Middle East that
[02:55:19.164 --> 02:55:22.685]  They didn't want to happen, but that goes with the territory.
[02:55:22.725 --> 02:55:24.705]  But there's evidence of them triggering a lot of it.
[02:55:24.765 --> 02:55:26.285]  I mean, you really don't think they're involved?
[02:55:26.345 --> 02:55:30.486]  No, no, that's the initial take that I had on the whole thing.
[02:55:31.166 --> 02:55:37.988]  And Webster Tarpley, as far as I know, is the only other one who took it almost exactly the same way I did.
[02:55:38.388 --> 02:55:45.509]  A distraction from the financial and economic problems in Europe and the United States, and then getting rid of
[02:55:47.218 --> 02:56:14.550]  Mubarak, who did not want the United States to invade Iran, and then the social political problems that went on, and to get thrown in there, a contract CIA employee killed a few people in Pakistan, and they pulled him out of there, and that didn't go down well with anybody, and so that certainly has hurt their ambitions.
[02:56:15.927 --> 02:56:20.229]  I think it's a mixed bag and they're going to have to take a while to put it back together again.
[02:56:21.189 --> 02:56:26.332]  And that's why we're going to have social and political changes and turmoil if you may.
[02:56:26.352 --> 02:56:29.333]  I think the Qaddafi thing will end rather quickly.
[02:56:30.893 --> 02:56:34.635]  They just can't keep on doing what they're doing there because he's going to lose.
[02:56:34.655 --> 02:56:36.536]  As far as the
[02:56:37.842 --> 02:57:07.126]  uh... the world economy i think i covered that with the united states and the rest of the world uh... in in varying degrees is going to follow uh... to quote ted anderson uh... sixteen hundred i'm looking for sixteen fifty uh... intermediate weeks days months and i think we got a shot at two thousand maybe even twenty four hundred uh... before the years out and uh... that means that
[02:57:08.154 --> 02:57:14.340]  The coins and the bars and the shares are all going to move up and people should be in there.
[02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:16.161]  If you're not, you're foolish.
[02:57:16.822 --> 02:57:22.467]  Of course, you've got to have your food and your filter and your methods of defending your family in first.
[02:57:22.547 --> 02:57:26.651]  But after that, you go for the coins and upward.
[02:57:27.311 --> 02:57:30.334]  And so that's generally where I see things going.
[02:57:31.655 --> 02:57:33.537]  Again, it's hard to put a timeline.
[02:57:34.887 --> 02:57:37.389]  On the price of oil and what's going to happen in the Middle East.
[02:57:37.449 --> 02:57:45.735]  But bottom line, we can feel the acceleration down the hill sliding into all of the bad fruits of globalism.
[02:57:45.775 --> 02:58:00.285]  We're now experiencing NAFTA and GATT, the North American Union, and imperialism and neo-colonialism of the bankers trying to diminish and destroy the nation state and basically tie us all to the giant derivatives
[02:58:01.805 --> 02:58:10.849]  I said that 51 years ago, and I'll say it again today.
[02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:12.449]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:58:13.010 --> 02:58:18.812]  And they're well on their way to trying to accomplish what they want, and we're well on our way to stopping them.
[02:58:19.192 --> 02:58:21.533]  And I promise you, we will stop them.
[02:58:21.933 --> 02:58:22.913]  No matter what the price.
[02:58:23.254 --> 02:58:23.754]  Absolutely.
[02:58:23.774 --> 02:58:26.215]  There's too many people in the world who know what's going on now.
[02:58:26.615 --> 02:58:27.495]  Bob, we're out of time.
[02:58:27.955 --> 02:58:28.556]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:28.596 --> 02:58:29.336]  We'll see you next week.
[02:58:30.219 --> 02:58:30.639]  Thank you.
[02:58:30.819 --> 02:58:31.660]  Thank you all for listening.
[02:58:31.860 --> 02:58:32.181]  You bet.
[02:58:32.561 --> 02:58:40.427]  There'll be updates on everything happening in the world and the whole Charlie Sheen situation at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and back this Sunday live.
