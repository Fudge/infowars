[00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:06.264]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:08.045]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:09.786]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:11.386]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.927]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:17.129]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:21.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.722]  Welcome, it is Wednesday, November 23rd, 2011.
[00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:36.065]  You are tuned in to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:40.489]  Thank you so very much for joining us today on this day before Thanksgiving.
[00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.292]  I'm going to be wishing you a happy Thanksgiving throughout the show.
[00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:45.253]  My name is Mike Adams.
[00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:55.441]  I'm the fill-in host for Alex today, who is on the road returning to Austin after filming a number of videos and filing many reports from the road, as you've heard and seen here.
[00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:58.415]  On the Alex Jones Show and InfoWars Nightly News!
[00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:13.008]  Now today we have just an incredible lineup of news, including coverage of the debate last night, where Ron Paul, well they gave him more than 89 seconds, for starters, can you imagine that?
[00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:26.132]  And he just blew away the competition with some rational, common sense answers to keep us out of wars, to return some fiscal sanity to America, and basically do what's right for the future of our nation.
[00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:50.842]  So we're going to be playing some clips for you from that debate and also bringing you some commentary on that and covering some of the crazy, the crazy answers by Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney and all the other globalists there who are now essentially saying that, hey, the Bill of Rights shouldn't apply to you if we declare some kind of a war, even if it hasn't been legally declared by the Congress.
[00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:52.503]  Imagine that.
[00:01:52.503 --> 00:02:14.621]  Also today coming up we have Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us at the bottom of the hour to talk about tyranny and a concept that we're calling trickle-down tyranny and what else is going on with the TSA and the world of security that was also the topic of the debates last night the CNN presidential debates or I'm sorry Republican nominee debates
[00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:25.585]  We also have coming up today Dr. Stuart Launkey, who's going to be talking to us about the dangers of environmental toxins that you may not know about.
[00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:36.129]  In fact, he's the author of a book called Invisible Killers, and he's here to talk to us about the toxic metals that are found in the environment and in the foods
[00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.070]  And in industrial processes that we are now taking into our bodies.
[00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:52.094]  And I am convinced that much of the insanity that we are seeing in the world today, especially in America, is due to heavy metals poisoning and chemical poisoning.
[00:02:52.754 --> 00:03:05.441]  I think it's a topic that we haven't covered enough and it could explain why so many voters and so many people, so many members of the mass public out there, they seem to be literally insane.
[00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.023]  I mean insane, completely irrational.
[00:03:08.803 --> 00:03:12.984]  Saying things like, oh, let's see, we're $15 trillion in debt.
[00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.405]  Let's get out of that debt by spending another $5 trillion.
[00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:19.466]  Whoo, that's brilliance right there.
[00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.147]  I think it's heavy metals poisoning, or at least that could be part of it.
[00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:24.047]  It's got to also be the fluoride.
[00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:30.669]  It's got to be related to the vaccines and the pesticides and, you know, all the chemicals that are out there in the food supply and in the environment.
[00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:36.767]  So we're going to be talking to Dr. Stuart Lonke to get some answers about that.
[00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:43.415]  And if you see me looking at all the notes here, for those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, it's just because we have so much to cover today.
[00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:45.837]  We've got news that will blow your mind.
[00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:49.021]  We've got news about BPA levels spiking 1200% in the blood of people.
[00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.425]  After they eat canned soup.
[00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:57.927]  Yeah, because the lining of the cans contains BPA.
[00:03:57.927 --> 00:04:12.153]  That's the hormone mimicking chemical bisphenol A. It does wonderful things for your body, like giving men breasts, infertility issues related to that, cancer issues related to that.
[00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:13.674]  It's crazy.
[00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.035]  We've also got, let's see here.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.963]  The turkey fryer terror coming up.
[00:04:18.963 --> 00:04:24.329]  The Department of Homeland Security has issued a warning, an alert, red alert.
[00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:27.393]  If you fry your turkey, you could set your house on fire.
[00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:31.298]  Yes, Janet Napolitano wants to be in your kitchen.
[00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:33.061]  That's kind of scary all by itself.
[00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:34.743]  Janet, stop eating the turkey.
[00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:38.997]  All right, all that and more is coming up here as we return.
[00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:40.938]  We've got all kinds of news coming up.
[00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:45.481]  We're coming back with more details about the Ron Paul appearance in the debates last night.
[00:04:45.481 --> 00:04:47.962]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:48.563]  Stay with us.
[00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:52.225]  We'll be right back after this break with more breaking news and analysis.
[00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:03.067]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:08.373]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:09.914]  Saving means to make money.

[00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:26.969]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:34.974]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:40.197]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:04.247]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:05.168]  Number one.
[00:07:05.168 --> 00:07:08.590]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.451]  Number two.
[00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:14.354]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:15.094]  It's true.
[00:07:15.094 --> 00:07:19.958]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:20.798]  Number three.
[00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:24.380]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.083]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:29.064]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:31.827]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:35.511]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.311]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:40.456]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.456 --> 00:07:45.221]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:49.665]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:51.466]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:53.708]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.708 --> 00:08:01.736]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:08.382]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:11.364]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:15.256]  All right, welcome folks.
[00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:19.178]  This is the Alex Jones Show on Wednesday, November 23rd, 2011.
[00:08:19.178 --> 00:08:26.483]  I'm the fill-in host today, Mike Adams, the health ranger, the editor of NaturalNews.com.
[00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:28.945]  And today we're going to be covering just a number
[00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:31.466]  ...of mind-blowing topics.
[00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:32.947]  Truly fascinating stuff.
[00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:36.709]  This is one of the most info-packed shows I've ever hosted here.
[00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:51.419]  Starting off with Ron Paul in the debate last night, where he squared off against Newt Gingrich and other globalists, who were all spouting some very scary information about why you shouldn't have your Bill of Rights if they think we're in a war.
[00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:58.857]  And we're going to run a little bit of video from that in a minute, but first, let me set this up and explain.
[00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:02.938]  They started off with a question from Edwin Meese, yeah, the former U.S.
[00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:09.900]  Attorney General, who begins by really spouting a series of lies.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:17.362]  He says, oh, there have been 42 terrorist attacks prevented by the Patriot Act.
[00:09:17.362 --> 00:09:21.063]  And he says the Patriot Act is a tool that's fundamental
[00:09:22.063 --> 00:09:36.892]  To stopping terrorists, and then he asks, shouldn't we have a quote, long-range extension of the Patriot Act so that these law enforcement officers can continue to use this wonderful, wonderful tool to prevent terrorism?
[00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.818]  And of course, predictably, all the other globalists on the stage, other than Ron Paul, they agree with Edwin Mies.
[00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:51.548]  Now, in his question, though, he didn't tell you the truth of these, quote, 42 terrorist attacks that have been prevented by the Patriot Act.
[00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.954]  Probably 41 out of 42 were attacks that were set up by the FBI, right?
[00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:13.286]  The FBI goes out there on the record, this is now publicly on the record, the FBI goes out there, creates the plots, recruits the so-called terrorists who are actually normally just innocent people who don't really know what they're involved in.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:20.548]  The FBI provides the money, they provide the weapons, they provide the planning, the motivation, the target lists.
[00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:27.858]  And then, after they hand this over to these would-be terrorists, magically another branch of the FBI shows up and guess what?
[00:10:27.858 --> 00:10:28.759]  Oh, they catch them!
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.481]  They catch them.
[00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:35.085]  This is like playing Cowboys and Indians in your own backyard sandbox, isn't it?
[00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:43.712]  Kind of like, okay, you play like the Indians or the terrorists, and we'll play like the Cowboys and we'll act like we catch you.
[00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:53.781]  And then we'll report to the media, what a great job we're doing stopping terrorism, and we'll use that as a justification to continue the completely illegal Patriot Act.
[00:10:54.321 --> 00:11:02.185]  Which is a violation at so many levels of basic, fundamental, not just human rights, but of course the Bill of Rights.
[00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:05.707]  So this was the question that Edwin Meese led off with.
[00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:09.949]  It was a loaded question, like using loaded dice in a poker game.
[00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:18.674]  And then, of course, Wolf Blitzer added right only that, he said, quote, gee, only this weekend there was an alleged terror plot uncovered in New York City.
[00:11:18.674 --> 00:11:19.114]  Oh my God!
[00:11:20.168 --> 00:11:22.772]  Yeah, probably another one set up by the FBI.
[00:11:22.772 --> 00:11:26.399]  They can do it more than once, you see.
[00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.581]  This makes them think they're important.
[00:11:29.318 --> 00:11:36.981]  So, then Gingrich replies, well, you have to have two sets of laws, really.
[00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:40.702]  The Bill of Rights only applies to, quote, criminal investigations.
[00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:46.404]  You know, people who rob others, or people who commit acts of violence or common crimes.
[00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:54.487]  But he says, you should have a totally different set of rules when there's a war, when there's national security at risk.
[00:11:54.487 --> 00:11:56.468]  You shouldn't have the Bill of Rights at all.
[00:11:57.228 --> 00:12:00.129]  This is, I'm paraphrasing him, obviously.
[00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:04.411]  He says, basically, the terror threat will be ongoing, probably through multiple generations.
[00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:10.234]  Yeah, because it's working out really well for the globalists to have this scary terror threat out there, even if they have to invent it.
[00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:16.069]  And by the way, Paul Craig Roberts is coming up at the bottom of this hour to give us more commentary on that.
[00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:21.570]  He wrote a great article a few weeks ago about the complete fabrication of the entire war on terror.
[00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.132]  That was published at InfoWars.com if you want to check that out.
[00:12:25.132 --> 00:12:33.034]  But Newt Gingrich goes on to say that you shouldn't have a Bill of Rights if there's a war going on.
[00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:36.415]  But you see, who decides if there's a war?
[00:12:36.415 --> 00:12:37.816]  It certainly wasn't Congress.
[00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:43.602]  They never declared a war, they never debated a declaration of a war, and Ron Paul points this out.
[00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:49.929]  But Newt Gingrich and the other globalists apparently think that they can just pronounce a war.
[00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:52.692]  Oh, there's a war, or a war-like...
[00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:54.174]  I don't
[00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:17.582]  Or a due process Fifth Amendment or even Tenth Amendment rights for the states.
[00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:30.256]  I mean, it just goes on and on and it is the most obscene example of just runaway, runaway, freedom-grabbing, terror-minded thinking.
[00:13:30.256 --> 00:13:31.878]  The philosophy of these people.
[00:13:32.438 --> 00:13:46.246]  Of these globalists who were on the stage last night, on the CNN debate, I tell you, their philosophy, every one of them, except for Ron Paul, their philosophy is identical to the philosophical foundations of Nazi war criminals.
[00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:46.966]  Alright?
[00:13:46.966 --> 00:13:50.508]  Who justify their actions by saying, we're at war!
[00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:52.009]  So therefore we can do anything!
[00:13:52.984 --> 00:13:56.546]  This is what Newt Gingrich seems to be proposing.
[00:13:56.546 --> 00:13:57.386]  It's incredible.
[00:13:57.386 --> 00:14:09.993]  Let's run some of that video footage of Ron Paul to hear what his answer was to these globalists and their war-mongering, terror-mongering, fear-mongering efforts to scare everybody into giving up their rights.
[00:14:09.993 --> 00:14:11.153]  Go ahead with that if you've got it.
[00:14:11.153 --> 00:14:13.395]  I'm Ron Paul, a congressman from Texas.
[00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:18.838]  I am pleased to be here in the debate because this is a very important debate.
[00:14:18.838 --> 00:14:22.980]  I am convinced that needless and unnecessary wars are a great detriment.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.342]  They undermine our prosperity and our liberties.
[00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:28.163]  They add to our deficits and they consume our welfare.
[00:14:28.163 --> 00:14:31.285]  We should take a careful look at our foreign policy.
[00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:36.419]  Alright, let's move ahead.
[00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:41.303]  This is Wolf Blitzer asking the loaded, or handling the loaded question from Edwin Meese.
[00:14:41.303 --> 00:14:43.204]  Go ahead about a minute and a half on that or so.
[00:14:43.204 --> 00:14:49.509]  In the meantime, let me read you a quote that Ron Paul had that he stated in this debate.
[00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:52.071]  He says, quote, I have a personal belief
[00:14:52.771 --> 00:14:56.532]  That you never have to give up liberty for security.
[00:14:56.532 --> 00:14:59.213]  That's his, and there was applause after he said that.
[00:14:59.213 --> 00:15:01.594]  What an amazing concept, huh?
[00:15:01.594 --> 00:15:04.095]  You never have to give up your liberty for security.
[00:15:04.095 --> 00:15:08.336]  He says, quote, you can still provide security without sacrificing our Bill of Rights.
[00:15:08.336 --> 00:15:09.477]  Let's see what else he's got to say.
[00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:10.357]  Go ahead.
[00:15:10.357 --> 00:15:12.238]  Bill of Rights.
[00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:14.098]  Yeah, he just said that right there.
[00:15:14.098 --> 00:15:17.059]  I want to bring others in, but do you want to respond, Mr. Speaker?
[00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:17.939]  Yeah.
[00:15:17.939 --> 00:15:19.220]  Timothy McVeigh succeeded.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.063]  That's the whole point!
[00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:31.406]  If you look at Newt's face during this debate, he's just so arrogant of how Timothy McVeigh succeeded.
[00:15:31.406 --> 00:15:34.767]  Yeah, who set up the Oklahoma City bombing, really?
[00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.329]  I mean, who was involved in 9-11, really?
[00:15:37.329 --> 00:15:38.709]  I mean, come on.
[00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:41.471]  Who's setting up all the fake terror plots across America today?
[00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:42.291]  It's the FBI.
[00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:43.132]  It's the insiders.
[00:15:43.132 --> 00:15:44.252]  We know that's going on.
[00:15:44.252 --> 00:15:47.034]  Who brought down World Trade Center Building 7?
[00:15:47.034 --> 00:15:47.894]  Come on.
[00:15:47.894 --> 00:15:49.855]  Demolition style, brought it down.
[00:15:51.596 --> 00:16:00.041]  You know, it's to the point where if you watch that debate, they got a room full of people, hundreds of people, and we'll play more from Ron Paul if you get that queued up there.
[00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:05.624]  You've got hundreds of people in there, you've got all these people on stage, you've got Wolf Blitzer asking questions.
[00:16:05.624 --> 00:16:08.645]  The only sane person in the room is Ron Paul.
[00:16:08.645 --> 00:16:13.268]  Everybody else there is clinically insane, in my opinion.
[00:16:14.564 --> 00:16:19.126]  They are living in an imaginary world where terror threats exist on every street corner.
[00:16:19.126 --> 00:16:20.446]  Terrorists are in your kitchen.
[00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:22.007]  Terrorists are in your shower.
[00:16:22.007 --> 00:16:23.127]  Terrorists are in your luggage.
[00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:24.708]  They're hiding in your luggage.
[00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:26.388]  And they're hiding down your pants.
[00:16:26.388 --> 00:16:30.250]  That's why the TSA has to reach down your pants to check for terrorism.
[00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:37.752]  You know, and Ron Paul replies and says, there wasn't a war declared on anybody, and terrorism is a concept, not a person, not a people.
[00:16:37.752 --> 00:16:39.193]  Go ahead and roll some more from Ron Paul there.
[00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:40.854]  Let's see if we get a good segment here.
[00:16:43.632 --> 00:16:45.033]  That's digging a hole for ourselves.
[00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:47.035]  What if they look like Timothy McVeigh?
[00:16:47.035 --> 00:16:48.516]  You know, he was pretty tough criminal.
[00:16:48.516 --> 00:16:50.257]  He's talking about profiling here.
[00:16:50.257 --> 00:16:53.279]  Too much carelessness in the use of words that we're at war.
[00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:57.643]  I don't remember voting on a declared declaration of war.
[00:16:57.643 --> 00:17:00.345]  Oh, war against terrorism.
[00:17:00.345 --> 00:17:02.006]  And terrorism is a tactic.
[00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:03.247]  It isn't a person.
[00:17:03.247 --> 00:17:04.568]  It isn't a people.
[00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:07.470]  So this is a verily careless use of words.
[00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.651]  What about this?
[00:17:08.651 --> 00:17:10.932]  Sacrifice liberties because they're terrorists?
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.161]  You're the judge and the jury?
[00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:14.721]  No, they're suspects!
[00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:22.144]  And they have changed, in the DOD budget, they have changed the wording on the definition of Al-Qaeda and Taliban.
[00:17:22.144 --> 00:17:27.986]  It's anybody associated with organizations, which means almost anybody can be loosely associated.
[00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:30.367]  So that makes all Americans vulnerable.
[00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:34.909]  And now we know that American citizens are vulnerable to assassination.
[00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:38.830]  So I would be very cautious about protecting the rule of law.
[00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.071]  It will be a sacrifice that you'll be sorry for.
[00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:43.153]  Herman Cain, let's bring you into this conversation.
[00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:56.003]  Those words should go down in history as the red alert warning from Ron Paul to all free-minded citizens who want to protect the future of their nation here in the United States.
[00:17:56.003 --> 00:18:01.687]  He says again, so I would be very cautious about protecting the rule of law.
[00:18:01.687 --> 00:18:03.969]  He says it will be a sacrifice.
[00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:07.012]  What he means is if you give up the rule of law, if you give up
[00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:08.453]  We're good to go.
[00:18:32.808 --> 00:18:36.429]  And just take out an American citizen without any due process whatsoever.
[00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:38.590]  Do you realize the magnitude of this, people?
[00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:55.596]  I'm hoping that you're really tuning in and really listening to this because, look, before 1776, before America had its independence, we had the British occupying forces over here in North America, and they were speaking the same kind of words that the globalists like Newt Gingrich are speaking today.
[00:18:55.596 --> 00:18:57.097]  They said, we're in a state of war.
[00:18:57.697 --> 00:18:58.837]  Therefore, you have no rights.
[00:18:58.837 --> 00:18:59.918]  We will interrogate you.
[00:18:59.918 --> 00:19:03.639]  You have no right to maintain your silence.
[00:19:03.639 --> 00:19:05.379]  You have no right to privacy.
[00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:07.760]  We will conduct illegal searches and seizures.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.441]  We will force you to quarter and house the soldiers and feed them and pay them money.
[00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:17.062]  We will force you to do all these things because we are the British Empire and because we are in a state of war.
[00:19:17.882 --> 00:19:26.873]  Apparently, apparently, Newt Gingrich now thinks that that same kind of thinking should be the rules that are followed here in America today.
[00:19:26.873 --> 00:19:30.517]  Don't you realize, people, the Bill of Rights was created to prevent that?
[00:19:31.522 --> 00:19:39.350]  Even the 3rd Amendment was about preventing us from having to be forced to quarter British soldiers in our homes, okay?
[00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.755]  The 4th Amendment, the 1st, the 2nd, on down the list.
[00:19:43.755 --> 00:19:49.301]  The reason they are there is because we do not want to be ruled by tyrants who declare a state of war.
[00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:50.762]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:50.762 --> 00:19:52.324]  We've got a lot more coming right back.
[00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:52.965]  Stay with us, alright?
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.582]  Burglars love easy targets, like a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.882]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:20:09.882 --> 00:20:13.764]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:20.926]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:20:20.926 --> 00:20:25.348]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:20:25.348 --> 00:20:32.050]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.132]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:39.717]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:30.613]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:30.613 --> 00:21:35.176]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.176 --> 00:21:40.980]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.622]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:44.622 --> 00:21:47.344]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:52.407]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:21:52.648 --> 00:21:54.049]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.

[00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:39.715]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:39.715 --> 00:22:49.602]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:49.602 --> 00:22:51.103]  The war is here.
[00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.444]  It's an info war.
[00:22:52.444 --> 00:22:53.825]  The Spirit of 1776 versus the Mindset of 1984.

[00:24:10.633 --> 00:24:14.255]  Happy Thanksgiving, everybody, and welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:14.255 --> 00:24:17.718]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in for Alex today.
[00:24:17.718 --> 00:24:24.362]  He is on the road, returning to Austin shortly, and will resume his regular duties here on the show.
[00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:25.963]  In the meantime, we're filling in.
[00:24:25.963 --> 00:24:31.007]  We've been talking about Ron Paul during the debates, and thank you again for staying tuned to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:31.007 --> 00:24:37.271]  We've got Paul Craig Roberts coming up in just, what is that, about seven, what, eight minutes, nine minutes, something like that.
[00:24:38.471 --> 00:25:03.900]  And we're going to be talking about the tyranny that is taking over America today, and the concept of trickle-down tyranny, which is what happens when all the local little bureaucrats and power people, they witness what's happening at the federal level, and they think, oh, it must be socially acceptable now to just act like a thug and act like a tyrant, and they replicate that, they mimic that, they shape that behavior.
[00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:06.882]  And become their own little local tyrants.
[00:25:06.882 --> 00:25:21.333]  Alright, but getting back to Ron Paul and the debate, you know, I gotta say, I'm trying to say Happy Thanksgiving, but also at the same time warn you, this may be your last free Thanksgiving.
[00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:23.675]  In other words, your last Thanksgiving as a free citizen.
[00:25:24.443 --> 00:25:40.687]  If we don't get Ron Paul and that kind of philosophy into positions of power in this country, if we end up being ruled by globalists, you're going to be next Thanksgiving, you're going to be looking back at this Thanksgiving and asking yourself, what the heck happened?
[00:25:40.687 --> 00:25:41.928]  What happened to our Bill of Rights?
[00:25:41.928 --> 00:25:43.548]  What happened to our freedoms?
[00:25:43.548 --> 00:25:45.629]  What happened to our bank accounts?
[00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:46.569]  What happened to our futures?
[00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:48.470]  Because Ron Paul is right.
[00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:51.312]  He is the only guy there that makes any sense.
[00:25:51.312 --> 00:26:05.942]  And I gotta say, I am honored today to be here hosting the Alex Jones Show and to be part of the InfoWars effort to enlighten people, to awaken people, because we want to prevent tyranny and prevent the enslavement of the people.
[00:26:05.942 --> 00:26:06.923]  We want freedom.
[00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:09.384]  And we want peace!
[00:26:09.384 --> 00:26:09.724]  Alright?
[00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:17.008]  Ron Paul wants to bring those soldiers home and close those bases where we are meddling with the foreign affairs of these other nations.
[00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:20.610]  Bring those soldiers home and have peace and have our family together.
[00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.250]  Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:28.153]  To have a Thanksgiving and a Christmas with your family where you don't have TSA searching your underwear at the airport.
[00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:35.137]  Where you don't have TSA checkpoints on the road as you're traveling from place to place in what's supposed to be a free country.
[00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:37.058]  Let me read you a couple more quotes from Ron Paul.
[00:26:38.365 --> 00:26:50.657]  In responding to a question about where Newt Gingrich says that we've got to have more police and we've got to have more security, again I'm paraphrasing, but he's saying we've got to have the Patriot Act, you know, give it even more power.
[00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:59.004]  Ron Paul says in response to that, this is like saying we need a policeman in every house, a camera in every house because we want to prevent wife beating.
[00:26:59.935 --> 00:27:11.962]  If you advocate the police state, yes, you can have security and you might prevent a crime, but the crime will then be against the American people and against our freedoms.
[00:27:11.962 --> 00:27:14.123]  And he's absolutely right about that.
[00:27:14.123 --> 00:27:21.648]  You can keep clamping down, you can put police on every corner, you can have checkpoints on every interstate and every highway, you can hire government.
[00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:23.129]  I don't know.
[00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:37.406]  That's the truth of the matter.
[00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:42.229]  And if you don't get that out there, folks, if you don't get this point, then I'm sorry.
[00:27:42.229 --> 00:27:47.532]  You are going down with the end of freedom in America today.
[00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:48.452]  You need to wake up.
[00:27:48.452 --> 00:27:49.433]  And Ron Paul says that.
[00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:50.073]  He's got a quote.
[00:27:50.073 --> 00:27:54.515]  He says, this is a road to disaster when he's talking about military spending.
[00:27:54.515 --> 00:27:57.697]  He says, we'd better wake up.
[00:27:57.697 --> 00:28:00.919]  If we don't wake up, this is all history.
[00:28:00.919 --> 00:28:02.780]  The Bill of Rights is about to become history.
[00:28:04.093 --> 00:28:09.242]  Your Fourth Amendment rights are eroding at an astonishing rate.
[00:28:09.242 --> 00:28:10.484]  It is very, very concerning.
[00:28:11.724 --> 00:28:23.467]  And I stand here, well I sit here in Alex Jones' chair today, but I stand here firmly on this principle that we must restore the rights that made this country great.
[00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:30.508]  That we must get the government out of our lives, out of our pants, off of our highways, out of our homes, stop with the secret surveillance.
[00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.769]  We've got more news about surveillance going on up here.
[00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:33.949]  Did you know that
[00:28:35.089 --> 00:28:35.729]  Stores!
[00:28:35.729 --> 00:28:45.772]  Now, retailers on Black Friday, coming up in just two days, they're going to be tracking you by monitoring your cell phone signals as you move from store to store.
[00:28:45.772 --> 00:28:47.293]  Yeah!
[00:28:47.293 --> 00:28:49.353]  I'm not making this up, folks.
[00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.094]  Search this online if you don't believe me.
[00:28:51.094 --> 00:28:54.835]  They're going to be tracking you moving from point to point, and they think it's all okay.
[00:28:55.922 --> 00:28:56.302]  Why?
[00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:58.202]  Because again, trickle-down tyranny.
[00:28:58.202 --> 00:29:10.005]  If the federal government is monitoring everything that you're doing and reading your emails and monitoring your Facebook posts and checking you on the highway, why shouldn't the local retailers do it too?
[00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:11.385]  Why shouldn't everybody do it?
[00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:22.528]  Let's all just become a police state of tattletales and Janet Napolitano's spy masters who spy on each other and run around paranoid.
[00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:23.848]  Oh my goodness!
[00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:27.049]  The retailers are tracking us, it must be good!
[00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:35.218]  Maybe they're going to give us a coupon for 50 cents off an iPad, which will also track you as you carry it around your home.
[00:29:35.218 --> 00:29:36.600]  Yeah, it's all coming up.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.262]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:38.262 --> 00:29:42.807]  We'll be right back after this break with Paul Craig Roberts and much more.
[00:29:42.807 --> 00:29:43.588]  Don't go away!
[00:29:49.707 --> 00:29:52.709]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:56.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.473 --> 00:30:01.634]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:08.580]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.123]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:11.123 --> 00:30:16.507]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:16.507 --> 00:30:19.550]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.612]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:21.852 --> 00:30:28.116]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:28.116 --> 00:30:31.478]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:31.478 --> 00:30:37.261]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:38.922]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:38.922 --> 00:30:40.203]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:40.203 --> 00:30:42.884]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:44.305]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:30:44.565 --> 00:30:47.086]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:51.728]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:30:51.728 --> 00:30:54.309]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:30:54.309 --> 00:30:58.170]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.191]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:05.986]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:05.986 --> 00:31:14.848]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:14.848 --> 00:31:19.469]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:30.291]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:40.433]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:40.433 --> 00:31:45.875]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:53.356]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:55.777]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:01.221 --> 00:32:05.225]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.225 --> 00:32:08.488]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.488 --> 00:32:13.272]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:13.272 --> 00:32:19.678]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.678 --> 00:32:21.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:22.741]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.741 --> 00:32:23.261]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:23.862]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:23.862 --> 00:32:24.582]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:24.582 --> 00:32:26.703]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.348 --> 00:32:43.189]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:43.189 --> 00:32:48.632]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.632 --> 00:33:01.139]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:06.762]  Well, you were sleeping.
[00:33:06.762 --> 00:33:10.004]  They came and took it all away.
[00:33:18.185 --> 00:33:21.793]  And we are back on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:21.793 --> 00:33:23.797]  Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving!
[00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:28.507]  Yeah, it was an inside job.
[00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:38.896]  All those FBI terror plots that are now being used to justify discussions about expanding the Patriot Act even more.
[00:33:38.896 --> 00:33:39.917]  Lock it in long term.
[00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.359]  Hey, who needs a Bill of Rights, huh?
[00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:44.281]  It only worked for a couple hundred years.
[00:33:44.281 --> 00:33:47.884]  Let's ditch it now, I guess, is what these people are thinking.
[00:33:47.884 --> 00:33:48.405]  Unbelievable.
[00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:55.060]  We do have Paul Craig Roberts coming up here in just a couple minutes, but quick, before then, we're going to cover a little bit of news.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.401]  Bring that graphic back up.
[00:33:56.401 --> 00:34:02.064]  BPA spikes 1,200% after eating canned soup.
[00:34:02.064 --> 00:34:07.848]  For those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see the visuals here.
[00:34:07.848 --> 00:34:18.174]  A new study shows that people who ate canned soup for five days straight saw their urinary levels of the chemical bisphenol A. That's the hormone mimicking chemical that has a lot of people concerned about
[00:34:18.914 --> 00:34:19.414]  Cancer.
[00:34:19.414 --> 00:34:25.617]  Ooh, a little bit of breast augmentation for males there.
[00:34:25.617 --> 00:34:28.899]  Not something that a lot of people want to do, understandably.
[00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:30.359]  That spikes 1,200%.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:36.442]  BPA 1,200% higher in the blood of those who are eating canned soup for five days straight.
[00:34:36.442 --> 00:34:41.305]  This is the first study to quantify BPA levels in humans after the ingestion of canned foods.
[00:34:42.794 --> 00:34:45.535]  Here's an interesting fact you may not know about this.
[00:34:45.535 --> 00:34:51.736]  There is no such thing as a canned food that has a liner in it which is free of BPA.
[00:34:51.736 --> 00:34:53.677]  To my knowledge, I checked.
[00:34:53.677 --> 00:35:02.039]  We called all the major can manufacturers throughout the industry to ask, is there a liner, an enamel inside cans that is free of BPA?
[00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:05.000]  And the answer we were told is no.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.281]  No such thing at the moment, but they're working feverishly on it.
[00:35:09.704 --> 00:35:13.167]  But then the other question is, what other chemicals are going to be in there besides the BPA?
[00:35:13.167 --> 00:35:20.012]  See, maybe it's BPA-free in the future, but it's got some other chemical that we don't even know about yet.
[00:35:20.012 --> 00:35:27.857]  Just make up three random letters, C, K, J. That's going to be the next chemical that they find in these cans.
[00:35:28.698 --> 00:35:30.679]  It all gets back to the basics, folks.
[00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:33.140]  If you eat food out of your own garden, huh?
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:41.785]  If you practice some home gardening and a little bit of permaculture and you eat that food, you're always going to be better off than eating something out of a can.
[00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:46.108]  We've got, from the American Dream, 20 signs that America is going crazy.
[00:35:46.108 --> 00:35:48.449]  Is this posted up on InfoWars, guys?
[00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:50.967]  I bet it is.
[00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:52.649]  20 more signs.
[00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:53.730]  Yeah, it's up there.
[00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.632]  Got a confirmation on that.
[00:35:55.632 --> 00:35:56.433]  Check it out.
[00:35:56.433 --> 00:35:59.677]  You know it's going crazy when you see presidential candidates up on stage.
[00:36:00.748 --> 00:36:10.294]  Who are debating and all of them except one say that we don't need a Bill of Rights as long as some president says we might be in a war.
[00:36:10.294 --> 00:36:12.056]  Doesn't make any sense.
[00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:15.918]  US and Arab states set to impose a no-fly zone over Syria.
[00:36:15.918 --> 00:36:21.062]  This is Paul Joseph Watson article now posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:21.062 --> 00:36:22.903]  It always starts with a no-fly zone, doesn't it?
[00:36:23.544 --> 00:36:43.200]  Yep, and then it becomes a no-life zone as they start with the depleted uranium bombing, another weapon of mass destruction that is being used by the military to make life unlivable in some of these target zones for not just a couple of years, but a couple of hundreds of thousands of years in some cases.
[00:36:46.564 --> 00:36:48.065]  Here's another article in Russia today.
[00:36:48.065 --> 00:36:52.488]  The West's fixation on Assad eclipses bloody chaos in Egypt.
[00:36:52.488 --> 00:36:59.394]  This is all just more beating the war drums, getting ready for action in Iran and Syria and somewhere else.
[00:36:59.394 --> 00:37:01.495]  Hey, we saw... What was this?
[00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:07.339]  Janet Napolitano and the Department of Homeland Security put out a warning about Turkey.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.241]  And I don't mean the country, Turkey.
[00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:13.163]  I thought it was going to be a terror alert about maybe Turkey.
[00:37:13.163 --> 00:37:15.924]  But, you know, Turkey's not in the news that much.
[00:37:15.924 --> 00:37:17.785]  Not like Iran and Syria these days.
[00:37:17.785 --> 00:37:22.367]  But no, it was about the dangers of frying a turkey in your own home.
[00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:23.088]  Oh my goodness!
[00:37:24.127 --> 00:37:27.570]  So we're going to have a little segment on that near the top of this hour.
[00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.031]  I brought some gear for it.
[00:37:29.031 --> 00:37:31.673]  I have fire gear here.
[00:37:31.673 --> 00:37:40.820]  Yeah, because they showed a video of a turkey catching on fire and burning down someone's porch deck.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:46.445]  And full flames everywhere from roasting, not roasting, but deep frying a turkey.
[00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:50.027]  So I'm going to don a fireman's hat and some Nomex gloves.
[00:37:51.303 --> 00:37:55.606]  And we're going to tackle the subject of cooking a turkey terror-style.
[00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:56.626]  That's right.
[00:37:56.626 --> 00:37:57.927]  That's all coming up here.
[00:37:57.927 --> 00:38:05.352]  And we do have Paul Craig Roberts joining us now, and he's here to talk about trickle-down tyranny and some of the other topics.
[00:38:05.352 --> 00:38:13.237]  Paul Craig Roberts is one of the most prolific and, in my opinion, one of the most brilliant political writers, if not the most, of all time.
[00:38:13.237 --> 00:38:18.300]  I'm a great admirer of Paul Craig Roberts, and we publish many of his stories, in fact, on Natural News.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.580]  Paul, are you with us?
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:19.961]  Can you hear me?
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.544]  Yes, I hear you, Mike, and I want to congratulate you for trickle-down turning.
[00:38:25.544 --> 00:38:26.645]  I will thank you, Paul.
[00:38:26.645 --> 00:38:28.826]  That really means a lot to me, coming from you.
[00:38:28.826 --> 00:38:32.429]  I've admired your writing and your analysis for many, many years.
[00:38:32.429 --> 00:38:38.213]  What is in your mind of what's going on today, especially following the debates that just happened last night?
[00:38:41.365 --> 00:38:44.948]  Well, you know, there's only one candidate for president, that's Ron Paul.
[00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:47.469]  The rest of them are a bunch of idiots.
[00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:52.653]  They're all trying to outdo one another in starting World War III.
[00:38:52.653 --> 00:38:57.095]  I've never seen such a collection of dopes in my life, I mean.
[00:38:57.095 --> 00:39:00.658]  And one of them, if not Obama, is going to be president.
[00:39:01.946 --> 00:39:04.028]  Yeah, that's pretty scary actually.
[00:39:04.028 --> 00:39:06.791]  I completely agree with your assessment there.
[00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:08.112]  It's like they can't read.
[00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:14.678]  It's like they think that the Bill of Rights must say at the very top, this does not apply if someone mentions the word war.
[00:39:14.678 --> 00:39:17.961]  There's no exception to the Bill of Rights.
[00:39:17.961 --> 00:39:19.823]  What do you say?
[00:39:19.823 --> 00:39:21.264]  No, of course there are no exceptions.
[00:39:21.264 --> 00:39:27.189]  You know, it could just be that they're all bought and paid for by the military security complex.
[00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:31.304]  You know, Eisenhower was, what, a half a century ago, wasn't it?
[00:39:31.304 --> 00:39:42.427]  President Eisenhower warned us in his farewell address at the end of his second term that American liberty was in danger from the military security complex.
[00:39:42.427 --> 00:39:47.469]  And so I believe that could be what we're seeing today.
[00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:57.052]  The takeover is so total that unless you're a complete shill for the military security complex, you can't even run for office.
[00:39:57.725 --> 00:40:00.046]  I mean, look at Obama, for example.
[00:40:00.046 --> 00:40:03.668]  You remember how excited everyone was about his election?
[00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:09.972]  You remember the massive numbers of people that went and sat in the cold for his inauguration?
[00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:11.953]  And many of them were miles away.
[00:40:11.953 --> 00:40:15.055]  Oh, he was like the second coming of Christ to some people.
[00:40:15.055 --> 00:40:21.879]  You know, it was an amazing... The country has never seen an outpouring of support for a president.
[00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:23.060]  I don't
[00:40:36.966 --> 00:40:49.388]  Uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh...
[00:41:05.851 --> 00:41:16.001]  Illusions, the illusionary platform from which all the other candidates are operating and even Wolf Blitzer is asking questions and then the people in the crowd are asking questions like Edwin Mies.
[00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:27.371]  Their illusionary platform is that the war on terror is very, very real and very scary and very much in your face and we have an immediate threat to our life and safety because of all these terrorists.
[00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:31.415]  But you, you were able to completely show that to be a total fraud.
[00:41:32.597 --> 00:41:46.862]  Yes, we're living in George Orwell's 1984 world, where Big Brother's media tells the people every day about all the wars that they're having to combat.
[00:41:46.862 --> 00:41:49.203]  And it's all hokum.
[00:41:49.203 --> 00:41:50.904]  It's all hoax.
[00:41:50.904 --> 00:41:58.226]  And it's amazing that no more than, say, what, a fourth of the population sees through it.
[00:41:58.226 --> 00:41:59.327]  It's an extraordinary thing.
[00:41:59.909 --> 00:42:04.012]  That is astonishing, and it really makes me wonder about some of the reasons behind that.
[00:42:04.012 --> 00:42:11.896]  Later on in this show, in fact, we're going to be talking about heavy metals poisoning and how that might be impacting cognitive function and clear thinking.
[00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.758]  What do you think, in your analysis, might be behind it?
[00:42:14.758 --> 00:42:16.699]  Are people just easily hoodwinked?
[00:42:16.699 --> 00:42:18.140]  Are they brainwashed?
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.862]  Are they apathetic?
[00:42:20.862 --> 00:42:25.365]  What do you think is psychologically behind this mass denial of reality?
[00:42:26.761 --> 00:42:28.163]  I think a lot of things.
[00:42:28.163 --> 00:42:33.590]  One is there's no media except for individual programs like Alex Jones.
[00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:41.040]  There's no reporting because the media was concentrated in the last years of the Clinton administration.
[00:42:41.921 --> 00:42:49.129]  And it's no longer run by journalists, it's no longer independent, it's no longer diverse, and so it serves as a propaganda ministry.
[00:42:49.129 --> 00:42:53.774]  You know, Gerald Salenti calls them prostitutes, which is an apt term.
[00:42:53.774 --> 00:42:58.219]  So there's no source of information for people unless they work at it full time.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:05.827]  You know, if they're on the internet, they read foreign press, they read sites that dig up the real news.
[00:43:05.827 --> 00:43:12.574]  You have to, in other words, it's a huge time and energy effort to get any idea of what's really going on.
[00:43:12.574 --> 00:43:14.216]  Most people can't do that.
[00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:18.400]  The other thing I think which has been controlling was they bought on to 9-11.
[00:43:19.501 --> 00:43:19.881]  Yeah.
[00:43:19.881 --> 00:43:28.426]  The minute you buy onto 9-11, you've accepted the premise for the police state, the warmonger state, the threats everywhere.
[00:43:28.426 --> 00:43:32.869]  And of course, this serves the interests of the military security complex, and they keep it alive.
[00:43:32.869 --> 00:43:43.915]  We see this with the FBI organizing fake terror plots so they can arrest some poor dude and scare the people further.
[00:43:43.915 --> 00:43:47.457]  So it's all a successful propaganda venture.
[00:43:47.677 --> 00:43:50.958]  But isn't it also, it's almost comedic.
[00:43:50.958 --> 00:43:52.658]  It is very clownish.
[00:43:52.658 --> 00:43:58.700]  It's like kindergartners playing with their imaginary friends and enemies.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.781]  This is what the FBI is doing and the ATF running guns into Mexico.
[00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:06.282]  And the American people don't see it.
[00:44:06.282 --> 00:44:08.063]  How can they be so blind to it?
[00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:08.463]  I don't get it.
[00:44:09.818 --> 00:44:10.859]  And that's a good question.
[00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:13.680]  How can they be so blind?
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:19.802]  But they're losing their country, their liberty, the reputation of the country.
[00:44:19.802 --> 00:44:23.443]  And I think we're headed toward World War III.
[00:44:23.443 --> 00:44:28.785]  Because when you can so delude an entire population, supposedly a superpower,
[00:44:29.365 --> 00:44:33.228]  Supposedly the richest country in the world, the best educated.
[00:44:33.228 --> 00:44:39.952]  You know, the United States allegedly has 17 of the top universities in the world.
[00:44:39.952 --> 00:44:43.895]  And yet we have a population that can't perceive fraud, right?
[00:44:43.895 --> 00:44:46.096]  It's practiced on them daily.
[00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:47.117]  It's an amazing thing.
[00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:51.180]  I don't know the answer, but you can see what the consequences are dire.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.201]  We now have a police state.
[00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:58.386]  And the police state, as you point out in your brilliant article, it's trickling down.
[00:44:58.386 --> 00:45:04.953]  Now everyone acts like they're running a torture chamber, even nursing homes.
[00:45:04.953 --> 00:45:09.637]  Oh yeah, yeah, just to give people some background about that article which I called trickle-down tyranny.
[00:45:10.538 --> 00:45:23.949]  That was about some waterboarding of an elderly woman, an 89-year-old woman in a nursing home was waterboarded by the staff in the nursing home over an argument about an ice cream sandwich, I believe it was.
[00:45:23.949 --> 00:45:25.570]  Ice cream, yeah.
[00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:27.112]  Ice cream, that's right.
[00:45:27.112 --> 00:45:29.374]  It's an extraordinary thing, and we see the police.
[00:45:30.034 --> 00:45:30.694]  Good to go.
[00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:51.983]  The police don't have the right to abuse the public.
[00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:56.568]  There's no... Police have to follow the law like everyone else.
[00:45:56.568 --> 00:46:00.052]  When they violate the law, they should be arrested and held accountable.
[00:46:00.052 --> 00:46:01.293]  But they're not.
[00:46:01.293 --> 00:46:08.001]  And it's like you say, if you don't hold the President accountable when he violates the law, then you can't hold anybody else accountable.
[00:46:08.001 --> 00:46:09.543]  And everyone's finding that out.
[00:46:10.046 --> 00:46:10.786]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:46:10.786 --> 00:46:12.507]  No one should be above the law.
[00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:20.249]  The laws must apply equally to all people across land, including the President, including the Congress, including law enforcement, especially law enforcement.
[00:46:20.249 --> 00:46:29.592]  But the greatest shift that I see here, that you've written about extensively, Paul, is that the government, quote, servants, now see themselves as rulers.
[00:46:29.592 --> 00:46:37.014]  They see themselves as tyrants, and so they act out on that self-image, and then the tyranny just begins to multiply.
[00:46:38.294 --> 00:46:40.135]  Whoa, what do you got going on back there?
[00:46:40.135 --> 00:46:55.101]  I got two cats and the little one thinks she's a leopard and if the big one gets out of line, she lets him have it.
[00:46:55.101 --> 00:46:58.722]  I think you're having a little trickle-down feline tyranny back there in your own house.
[00:46:58.722 --> 00:47:04.585]  Hey, maybe Janet Napolitano should put a camera in your living room just to make sure you're safe.
[00:47:04.585 --> 00:47:05.545]  They probably have one.
[00:47:07.967 --> 00:47:15.240]  No, but what do you think about the acting out of the self-image role of being a thuggish tyrant ruler?
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.346]  And that's how many of these so-called servants now see themselves.
[00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:23.832]  Yes, well, as you and I both see, the aristocrats.
[00:47:23.832 --> 00:47:31.897]  You remember the classic sort of protest of the unaccountability of the aristocrats?
[00:47:31.897 --> 00:47:45.246]  There's the story of the Duke's or the Earl's carriage being driven at great speed through the village and it runs down the children of the peasants in the streets and goes on off
[00:47:45.806 --> 00:47:47.647]  And nobody can do anything about it.
[00:47:47.647 --> 00:47:50.089]  Well, that's the kind of country we live in now.
[00:47:50.089 --> 00:48:01.215]  As long as the people doing the damage are in the security complex or high government leaders, they're untouchable.
[00:48:02.282 --> 00:48:03.443]  And it trickles down.
[00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:10.727]  I wrote a book, I think, maybe 12 years ago, that Oxford University Press published called The Capitalist Revolution in Latin America.
[00:48:10.727 --> 00:48:15.129]  And I quoted one of the ministers of one of the South American governments.
[00:48:15.129 --> 00:48:25.255]  And he said, if the minister lies and steals, by the time it trickles down to the bottom, his subordinates are raping and murdering.
[00:48:25.255 --> 00:48:26.956]  Yeah, right.
[00:48:26.956 --> 00:48:28.997]  Right, it sort of escalates on the way down.
[00:48:28.997 --> 00:48:30.018]  It goes down.
[00:48:30.977 --> 00:48:37.072]  You know, the notion of a nursing home waterboarding an 89 year old woman...
[00:48:38.618 --> 00:48:42.099]  You know, before today, who would have believed such a thing?
[00:48:42.099 --> 00:48:43.379]  No, exactly.
[00:48:43.379 --> 00:48:51.041]  This is part of the... What I've tried to point out in that article is that it has infected the fabric of American culture.
[00:48:51.041 --> 00:49:07.606]  And you see this with shows like 24, with Kiefer Sutherland, who's a great actor, but I just don't agree with the message of the show, which was torturing everybody, even little children, I believe, to get answers out because it was all justified under fighting terrorists and stopping some other violence.
[00:49:08.306 --> 00:49:10.707]  It's the culture now.
[00:49:10.707 --> 00:49:11.307]  It's the culture.
[00:49:11.307 --> 00:49:17.430]  And of course, it's all contrary to everything that experts know about torture.
[00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:20.052]  It never gets good information.
[00:49:20.052 --> 00:49:27.415]  The person being tortured simply tries to find out what the people torturing him want to know, and then he tells them.
[00:49:27.415 --> 00:49:28.576]  Yeah, what do you want to hear?
[00:49:28.576 --> 00:49:31.197]  What's it going to take to make the torture stop?
[00:49:31.197 --> 00:49:32.958]  Anything to stop the torture.
[00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:36.900]  And particularly, see, in Guantanamo, we now know for a fact
[00:49:37.788 --> 00:49:40.372]  That almost everyone there was totally innocent.
[00:49:40.372 --> 00:49:45.580]  They were people sold by warlords to the idiot Americans who paid a bounty for them.
[00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:55.101]  And so they ended up having to release almost all of the people after torturing them for five or six or seven years.
[00:49:55.101 --> 00:50:01.443]  So they were all totally innocent and yet they all were tortured all those years and no information came out.
[00:50:01.443 --> 00:50:03.523]  None.
[00:50:03.523 --> 00:50:05.144]  It's incredible, Paul.
[00:50:05.144 --> 00:50:08.224]  We've only got a minute left here.
[00:50:08.224 --> 00:50:10.245]  Can you stay with us after this break for a few more minutes?
[00:50:11.192 --> 00:50:11.912]  If you like.
[00:50:11.912 --> 00:50:12.673]  Okay.
[00:50:12.673 --> 00:50:19.275]  I would really like to ask you a couple more questions, but quickly, as we go to break, where do you think this is heading?
[00:50:19.275 --> 00:50:23.276]  Has Ron Paul made his point and awakened enough people?
[00:50:23.276 --> 00:50:30.359]  Or are we still muddling through La La Land of illusions and terrorism fantasies by the globalists?
[00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:35.878]  I don't think Ron Paul can awaken more than about 20% of the population.
[00:50:35.878 --> 00:50:38.999]  The rest of them, I think, are lost.
[00:50:38.999 --> 00:50:50.045]  And to answer the earlier question, to complete it, psychologically, many Americans think of themselves as, you know, the great people.
[00:50:50.045 --> 00:50:51.146]  Paul, stay with us.
[00:50:51.146 --> 00:50:56.348]  We're going to go to break right now, but we'll be right back with more from Paul Craig Roberts here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:56.348 --> 00:50:56.969]  Stay right there.
[00:51:00.717 --> 00:51:05.921]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.498 --> 00:52:01.799]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:07.405]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:52:07.405 --> 00:52:12.410]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.890]  It's true.
[00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:17.455]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:52:17.975 --> 00:52:23.199]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:52:23.199 --> 00:52:25.520]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.323]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[00:54:12.663 --> 00:54:15.745]  Welcome back folks to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:15.745 --> 00:54:21.769]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger here, getting ready to fry a turkey.
[00:54:21.769 --> 00:54:24.851]  And we've got Paul Craig Roberts joining us by Skype.
[00:54:24.851 --> 00:54:26.932]  I am dressed in full fire gear.
[00:54:26.932 --> 00:54:28.273]  I've got Nomex gloves.
[00:54:28.273 --> 00:54:29.714]  I've got a fireman's helmet here.
[00:54:30.711 --> 00:54:32.012]  Yeah, you hear that?
[00:54:32.012 --> 00:54:37.877]  I've got fireproof goggles on, melt-proof goggles, and I've got a respirator on the floor.
[00:54:37.877 --> 00:54:39.838]  We're gonna cook a turkey, man!
[00:54:39.838 --> 00:54:43.121]  And we're gonna do it Janet Napolitano style.
[00:54:43.121 --> 00:54:53.870]  Yeah, because they put out a warning yesterday, an official tweet from the Department of Homeland Security that says, watch out Americans, your turkey might burn down your house if you cook it wrong.
[00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:55.231]  I am so happy
[00:54:55.851 --> 00:55:01.956]  That we're now getting recipe instructions from Janet Napolitano, how to make ogre pie, things like that.
[00:55:01.956 --> 00:55:07.060]  I can't wait to see what the Christmas recipes are going to be from Janet Napolitano.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.442]  But Paul, if you'll stay with us for a second, I want to ask your reaction on this.
[00:55:10.442 --> 00:55:20.530]  But for those watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, let's go to the video and show the fireman cooking a turkey and showing you how dangerous it is and how it might burn down your house.
[00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:20.971]  Go to that.
[00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:27.868]  Tested several models of deep fat turkey fryers and find that this method of cooking can be very hazardous.
[00:55:27.868 --> 00:55:29.971]  Looks like our partially frozen turkey is ready.
[00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:32.916]  Here they go!
[00:55:36.302 --> 00:55:41.125]  Showing a big turkey cooking deep fryer sitting on a wooden deck.
[00:55:41.125 --> 00:55:45.248]  Now they got a fireman there with a full helmet, full respirator, Nomex hood.
[00:55:45.248 --> 00:55:48.610]  He's walking up with his fireman boots and he's got a turkey in his hands.
[00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.752]  Oh my god, he's taking the lid off the turkey cooking device.
[00:55:51.752 --> 00:55:53.833]  He's gonna drop the turkey down into it!
[00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:55.114]  Oh my god!
[00:55:55.114 --> 00:55:56.795]  There's fire everywhere!
[00:55:56.795 --> 00:55:58.196]  Flames everywhere!
[00:55:58.196 --> 00:56:00.717]  It's burning up the turkey!
[00:56:00.717 --> 00:56:01.838]  It's burning up the deck!
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.069]  I've never seen such kitchen terror in my life!
[00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:08.112]  It's catching on fire!
[00:56:10.865 --> 00:56:13.066]  Alright, now they're giving you the safety rundown.
[00:56:13.066 --> 00:56:13.946]  Oh, man.
[00:56:13.946 --> 00:56:16.366]  Are they going to trip it over?
[00:56:16.366 --> 00:56:17.167]  Ow!
[00:56:17.167 --> 00:56:20.668]  The oil just came out.
[00:56:20.668 --> 00:56:22.508]  It's a dangerous cooking device.
[00:56:22.508 --> 00:56:23.348]  Alright, enough of that.
[00:56:23.348 --> 00:56:24.789]  Enough of that video.
[00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:25.669]  It's getting hot in here.
[00:56:25.669 --> 00:56:28.030]  Alright, I'm going to take all this gear off.
[00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:36.652]  Look, I don't mean to make light of kitchen cooking accidents because you can have fires in the kitchen and you should have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen.
[00:56:37.486 --> 00:56:38.407]  But isn't this getting ridiculous?
[00:56:38.407 --> 00:56:42.189]  Where the Department of Homeland Security is now telling us what to cook?
[00:56:42.189 --> 00:56:44.330]  Or how to cook things?
[00:56:53.464 --> 00:56:54.465]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:56:54.465 --> 00:56:57.848]  All right, Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for bearing with me on that.
[00:56:57.848 --> 00:56:59.609]  I'm taking off all the fire gear now.
[00:56:59.609 --> 00:57:02.032]  What do you think about all that video stuff?
[00:57:02.032 --> 00:57:05.895]  Well, it didn't come through, but I could hear it.
[00:57:05.895 --> 00:57:14.282]  And I suspect that very soon the Department of Homeland Security will declare turkey cookers to be terrorist devices.
[00:57:14.282 --> 00:57:16.324]  And if you have one, you'll be arrested.
[00:57:16.324 --> 00:57:19.447]  It'll be proof that you are planning a terrorist act.
[00:57:21.366 --> 00:57:22.727]  Oh, well, it's hard to say.
[00:57:22.727 --> 00:57:26.091]  They're going to come up with all kinds of new things to scare us with.
[00:57:26.091 --> 00:57:33.718]  It just seems like the overriding theme of everything they put out there is, be afraid, spy on your neighbor, be paranoid.
[00:57:33.718 --> 00:57:36.961]  Isn't this the opposite of what they should be teaching people?
[00:57:36.961 --> 00:57:38.443]  Really?
[00:57:38.443 --> 00:57:40.044]  Especially when there's no threat.
[00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:46.377]  You know, what terrorist threat have we suffered other than 9-11?
[00:57:46.377 --> 00:57:55.229]  And there's a great deal of dissent that this was actually done by the Saudi Arabians from Iraq.
[00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:59.054]  All the others are staged by the FBI.
[00:57:59.054 --> 00:58:04.860]  There are no other terrorist examples here.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:13.831]  And yet we have this huge department that I think consumes $80 billion a year and which is now stopping traffic on the nation's highways.
[00:58:13.831 --> 00:58:14.231]  Right.
[00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:15.432]  Thanksgiving Day traffic.
[00:58:16.073 --> 00:58:25.400]  And, you know, it's... So bureaucracies always grow as rapidly and extend their jurisdiction as far as they can.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.121]  So that's part of it.
[00:58:26.121 --> 00:58:27.081]  All right.
[00:58:27.081 --> 00:58:28.682]  Paul Craig Roberts, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[00:58:28.682 --> 00:58:30.224]  I want to thank you for joining us today.
[00:58:30.224 --> 00:58:32.545]  This has been a great segment with you.
[00:58:32.545 --> 00:58:38.410]  This is Mike Adams starting brush fires in the minds of men and having the gear to put them out later on.
[00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:38.950]  Stay with us.
[00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:39.511]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.288 --> 00:58:51.793]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.793 --> 00:58:56.496]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:58:56.496 --> 00:59:02.920]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.202]  Number one, study the past.
[00:59:05.202 --> 00:59:07.583]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:59:07.583 --> 00:59:11.306]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:59:12.426 --> 00:59:15.529]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:59:15.529 --> 00:59:19.373]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[00:59:19.373 --> 00:59:28.422]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:59:28.422 --> 00:59:31.845]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:59:31.845 --> 00:59:35.468]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:41.252]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:59:41.252 --> 00:59:45.854]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:45.854 --> 00:59:53.558]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:53.558 --> 00:59:55.959]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:58.741]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.093]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:11.674]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.595]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.595 --> 01:00:17.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:21.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.864 --> 01:00:31.349]  We survived it, folks, the possible firestorm caused by cooking a turkey.
[01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:34.851]  I want to thank Paul Craig Roberts, who just joined us in the last segment.
[01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:37.153]  I apologize for cutting him off there.
[01:00:37.153 --> 01:00:38.914]  Sometimes when you're going to break, you got to do that.
[01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:42.197]  But Paul Craig Roberts, one of, one of, personally,
[01:00:42.797 --> 01:00:50.779]  The people that I admire the most as a writer and a thinker and an analyst, every time I read his articles I learn something new and quite profound.
[01:00:50.779 --> 01:00:53.139]  So be sure to check out his information.
[01:00:53.139 --> 01:00:56.140]  Is there a website, guys, for Paul Craig Roberts that we should give out?
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.100]  Let me know.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.141]  Moving on, turkey frying terror.
[01:01:00.141 --> 01:01:04.862]  I thought, you know, in this segment here we'd have just a bit of a comedic relief.
[01:01:06.206 --> 01:01:12.127]  What about seven other foods that Janet Napolitano thinks might be tools of terrorism, huh?
[01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:26.890]  Hey, if deep-frying a turkey is so dangerous that they have to issue an official tweet about it, maybe there are some other weapons of mass convection, that's your oven convection, that we should be concerned about.
[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:32.211]  Now, I have six, and I'm challenging the crew back there to come up with the seventh.
[01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:32.811]  You got it?
[01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:33.791]  You gotta come up with the seventh.
[01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:34.131]  Here we go.
[01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:39.361]  Seven other foods that could be tools of terrorism.
[01:01:39.361 --> 01:01:42.143]  Number one, of course, would be human breast milk.
[01:01:42.143 --> 01:01:43.504]  They already think that's terrorism.
[01:01:43.504 --> 01:01:46.666]  That's why they have infiltrators.
[01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:47.446]  Yeah, that's a good word.
[01:01:47.446 --> 01:01:48.747]  Infiltrators.
[01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:53.770]  And spies who are going out and trying to arrest people who are buying and selling and transporting raw milk.
[01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.890]  And why is it dangerous?
[01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:57.051]  Oh, because it's not pasteurized.
[01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:57.532]  It's alive.
[01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:03.858]  Of course, we've got these suggestions, by the way, were from the Natural News Facebook fan page.
[01:02:03.858 --> 01:02:06.939]  So I want to thank those fans for their little contributions.
[01:02:06.939 --> 01:02:14.241]  They gave me the idea of baked beans because they produce flammable gases, which are illegal to carry on an airplane, by the way.
[01:02:14.241 --> 01:02:18.062]  So that could be a weapon of terrorism very soon.
[01:02:18.062 --> 01:02:22.784]  Microwavable popcorn because it explodes and it sounds like gunfire.
[01:02:23.644 --> 01:02:27.606]  You microwave popcorn, you could get a visit from DHS.
[01:02:27.606 --> 01:02:29.827]  How about that Velveeta cheese?
[01:02:29.827 --> 01:02:30.848]  Hmm?
[01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.169]  Because you can't identify it.
[01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:33.429]  It has no biometrics.
[01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:36.191]  Nobody knows what it's really made of.
[01:02:36.191 --> 01:02:36.911]  Kind of a mystery.
[01:02:36.911 --> 01:02:41.014]  We're not even sure if it has a genetic code, so we don't know if it's GMO or not.
[01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:41.494]  Big mystery.
[01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:44.629]  Uh, deviled eggs.
[01:02:44.629 --> 01:02:45.149]  Yep.
[01:02:45.149 --> 01:02:47.149]  Because, of course, the devil's in them.
[01:02:47.149 --> 01:02:48.529]  Deviled eggs.
[01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:49.970]  Uh, green peas.
[01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:54.111]  That could be another food of tremendous terror.
[01:02:54.111 --> 01:02:54.611]  Why?
[01:02:54.611 --> 01:02:55.211]  Why, you ask?
[01:02:55.211 --> 01:03:02.613]  Well, obviously because the Department of Homeland Security doesn't want anything resembling world peas.
[01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:05.594]  Bad humor on this Thanksgiving holiday.
[01:03:05.594 --> 01:03:06.174]  Thank you, guys.
[01:03:06.174 --> 01:03:08.515]  Alright, what's your suggestion, guys?
[01:03:08.515 --> 01:03:10.155]  You got a food?
[01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:16.089]  Vitamin C. How could that be a terror weapon?
[01:03:16.089 --> 01:03:21.115]  Vitamin C. Because it lets you see things that you're not supposed to see.
[01:03:21.115 --> 01:03:22.897]  I got you.
[01:03:22.897 --> 01:03:23.598]  You're good.
[01:03:23.598 --> 01:03:24.679]  Okay.
[01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:28.743]  That was from the InfoWars staff behind the curtain right back there.
[01:03:29.793 --> 01:03:33.776]  Yeah, I hope you're staying entertained and informed at the same time.
[01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:38.579]  Our focus here is to, of course, give you a little bit of both.
[01:03:38.579 --> 01:03:49.887]  But this reminds me, oh, no, here's a quote from someone on the Facebook page who was reacting to this news that DHS put out this tweet about the dangers of frying turkey.
[01:03:49.887 --> 01:03:53.870]  And I'm bleeping out the profanity here, so it's clean, okay?
[01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:54.731]  It's okay for radio.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:11.426]  This person says, quote, they're only dangerous, talking about the turkey, the turkeys being dropped into the fryers, they're only dangerous because bleeping idiots think they can throw frozen bleep into a vat of boiling bleep on top of an open flame and that everything will be okay.
[01:04:11.426 --> 01:04:14.708]  Yeah, he's got a point, right?
[01:04:15.865 --> 01:04:20.008]  Think about the laws of physics when you do this stuff.
[01:04:20.008 --> 01:04:28.053]  There is an open flame, it can chip easily, there's hot oil, and you shouldn't just throw something frozen in there.
[01:04:28.053 --> 01:04:32.536]  Alright, but this also brings me to a quote from Thomas Jefferson, which will take us to break.
[01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.013]  Vitamin C something say something!
[01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:54.639]  That's the winning entry in the Terror Food Alert!
[01:04:54.639 --> 01:04:56.202]  Vitamin C something say something!
[01:04:56.202 --> 01:04:57.664]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:04:57.664 --> 01:04:58.205]  Stay with us!
[01:05:00.558 --> 01:05:01.719]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:08.662]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.662 --> 01:05:11.204]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.204 --> 01:05:16.586]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.586 --> 01:05:19.628]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.628 --> 01:05:21.689]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.949 --> 01:05:28.194]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.194 --> 01:05:31.577]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.577 --> 01:05:37.362]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.362 --> 01:05:39.003]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.003 --> 01:05:40.304]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:42.986]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.986 --> 01:05:47.210]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.812]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:05:49.992 --> 01:05:51.793]  End of America 3.com.

[01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:05.602]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.602 --> 01:07:09.525]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.767]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:11.767 --> 01:07:17.631]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.631 --> 01:07:23.856]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.276 --> 01:07:30.257]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.257 --> 01:07:34.438]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.438 --> 01:07:38.719]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:44.660]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.220]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.201]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:50.641]  It's here.

[01:08:01.056 --> 01:08:03.820]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.624]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.231 --> 01:08:14.792]  Oh yeah, welcome back!
[01:08:14.792 --> 01:08:16.594]  Hey, happy Thanksgiving everybody!
[01:08:16.594 --> 01:08:21.357]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[01:08:21.357 --> 01:08:24.920]  And we've been talking about nutrition.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.942]  Yeah, the evil, the evil nutrients.
[01:08:27.942 --> 01:08:31.405]  Like vitamin C something say something.
[01:08:31.405 --> 01:08:34.127]  As Janet Napolitano's favorite vitamin.
[01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:37.590]  And then Bill Gates' favorite vitamin is vitamin D population agenda.
[01:08:39.203 --> 01:08:39.904]  How's that?
[01:08:39.904 --> 01:08:42.946]  I actually got a laughter from behind the glass on that one.
[01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:46.449]  You gotta surprise these guys from time to time.
[01:08:46.449 --> 01:08:47.450]  But thank you for joining us.
[01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:48.591]  I always enjoy hosting here.
[01:08:48.591 --> 01:09:03.403]  It's really an honor to be here, to be filling in for Alex, who's on the road, probably getting stopped by TSA somewhere and filming it, and having an altercation of some sort that we're going to find out about tomorrow or the next day, so I can't wait to find out about that.
[01:09:04.329 --> 01:09:10.433]  I texted Alex this morning and said I'm going to be covering Ron Paul, I'm going to be covering some of these things, and I didn't get an answer.
[01:09:10.433 --> 01:09:16.117]  So he's probably like on the road, man, just really going for it, trying to get back to Austin as soon as possible.
[01:09:16.117 --> 01:09:17.438]  So good for him.
[01:09:17.438 --> 01:09:20.080]  And thank you for inviting me on here to host.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:28.546]  So, continuing, we've got a lot more news coming up, and at the bottom of this hour we have a Dr. Stuart Lonke, who's going to be joining us to talk about
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.121]  Some of the dangers out there in the environment.
[01:09:31.121 --> 01:09:33.323]  Stuff that we really haven't focused on that much.
[01:09:33.323 --> 01:09:35.965]  The heavy metals poisoning in our environment.
[01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:38.627]  The chemical poisoning that we're not aware of.
[01:09:38.627 --> 01:09:48.013]  And he's really more of a conventional doctor, but who has specialized in cancer prevention by telling the truth about the effects of toxic chemicals and heavy metals.
[01:09:48.013 --> 01:09:49.574]  So he'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:49.574 --> 01:09:50.095]  Until then!
[01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:52.192]  We've got more news.
[01:09:52.192 --> 01:09:54.253]  Alright, Prozac and fluoride.
[01:09:54.253 --> 01:10:02.740]  Look, I just wanted to... I know Alex has covered this a lot here on the show, but I wanted to reiterate that Prozac is 94% fluoride.
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.622]  Alright?
[01:10:04.622 --> 01:10:06.363]  94% fluoride.
[01:10:06.363 --> 01:10:13.609]  So if Prozac makes you chill out, and it makes kids feel okay, and it makes adults feel okay,
[01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:15.951]  What do you think fluoride's doing?
[01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:19.292]  You think fluoride is not, not psychoactive?
[01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:20.633]  Of course it's psychoactive!
[01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.314]  That goes all the way back to Nazi Germany.
[01:10:22.314 --> 01:10:30.798]  Oh, by the way, along those lines, I've been reading more books by Jim Mars, and I have to say, read Jim Mars.
[01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:33.159]  Read the book called Rise of the Fourth Reich.
[01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:49.948]  It is an amazing tour of the Nazi Germany influence on NASA, on the space program, on politics, on banking, on pharmaceuticals, on agriculture, pesticides, you name it, it's incredible.
[01:10:49.948 --> 01:10:56.272]  And it's extremely well documented, so giving a big shout out to Jim Mars, who by the way is a guest here on the Alex Jones Show from time to time.
[01:10:57.236 --> 01:11:00.820]  Also coming up in the next hour we're going to have Robert Scott Bell joining us.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.962]  He's a host also with GCN.
[01:11:02.962 --> 01:11:10.890]  He has his own radio show and he's going to be joining us to share some of the things that we all have to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.
[01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:19.859]  I'm going to be given five things and Robert's got his five things and hopefully I want to open up the phones today and ask you to call in and with your comments on Ron Paul, the debates,
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:27.945]  Or the on-fire turkey roasting episode that Janet Napolitano warned us about?
[01:11:27.945 --> 01:11:32.789]  Or even maybe what you're thankful for this Thanksgiving, because we do have a lot to be thankful for, don't we?
[01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:33.749]  Really.
[01:11:33.749 --> 01:11:39.373]  Even in the midst of all this tyranny and all this oppression and all the insanity out there, think about it.
[01:11:39.373 --> 01:11:41.015]  We still have Ron Paul on stage.
[01:11:41.855 --> 01:11:43.235]  Telling the truth.
[01:11:43.235 --> 01:11:44.336]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:11:44.336 --> 01:11:45.996]  We still have InfoWars.
[01:11:45.996 --> 01:11:47.077]  We have Alex Jones.
[01:11:47.077 --> 01:11:48.517]  We have this media channel.
[01:11:48.517 --> 01:12:00.281]  We have all of you out there, the supporters, the listeners, the viewers, the people who are putting the, sending out the tweets and putting it on Facebook and putting the bumper stickers out there and handing out the movies and the DVDs.
[01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:01.621]  Good for you!
[01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:02.442]  I'm thankful for you.
[01:12:02.442 --> 01:12:03.662]  You know, speaking of that,
[01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:07.714]  They didn't even ask me to plug this, but I just feel like it's appropriate.
[01:12:07.714 --> 01:12:11.836]  Can you give a shot, a video shot of these movies over here?
[01:12:11.836 --> 01:12:18.878]  Right now, the InfoWars store is offering the 18 DVDs at a low price.
[01:12:18.878 --> 01:12:19.198]  Is that $129?
[01:12:19.198 --> 01:12:19.879]  Is that the price?
[01:12:22.402 --> 01:12:23.322]  99?
[01:12:23.322 --> 01:12:24.764]  Are you kidding me?
[01:12:24.764 --> 01:12:26.545]  I'm not going to turn this into an infomercial.
[01:12:26.545 --> 01:12:28.987]  No, I just think it's a great buy.
[01:12:28.987 --> 01:12:33.731]  I'm actually picking up this whole set myself today because I haven't seen all of Alex's films.
[01:12:33.731 --> 01:12:35.693]  I must admit, I haven't seen them all.
[01:12:35.693 --> 01:12:47.623]  I've seen many of them, I've followed Alex for many years, but I haven't seen all the films and I think I can learn some more also because there's nobody on the cutting edge of just doing this research year after year, day after day, sacrificing his personal time
[01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:54.686]  I mean, he's even on vacation reporting, doing the news, doing investigative journalism as he's on vacation.
[01:12:54.686 --> 01:12:58.987]  It's like, we're here in the Grand Canyon, and here's what you need to know.
[01:12:58.987 --> 01:12:59.888]  Here's another film.
[01:12:59.888 --> 01:13:01.628]  Yeah, it's $99.95.
[01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:07.170]  Alright, so I was off by 95 cents, but $99.95 at the Infowars.com store.
[01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:14.273]  You can get these 18 DVDs, all of Alex Jones films, ever!
[01:13:14.273 --> 01:13:16.234]  Woo, that's some Christmas viewing for you right there.
[01:13:17.162 --> 01:13:18.242]  Hand them out to your family and friends.
[01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:35.574]  He's fighting on the front lines, he's telling the truth, he's doing his part, and the mainstream media isn't recognizing him.
[01:13:35.574 --> 01:13:36.194]  And I said, you know what?
[01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:37.255]  You're right, man.
[01:13:37.255 --> 01:13:40.037]  You are right, and you need more recognition, and you deserve it.
[01:13:40.037 --> 01:13:43.100]  So, I put out an article that just said, I salute you, man.
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:48.784]  I salute what you're doing, what you stand for, the truth that you are speaking out there, the shows that you're filming.
[01:13:48.784 --> 01:13:51.527]  You are a great American hero.
[01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:52.588]  A true patriot.
[01:13:53.684 --> 01:13:57.445]  Just like Ron Paul, just like Alex Jones, and many other people out there.
[01:13:57.445 --> 01:14:00.366]  So, you know, hats off to you, man.
[01:14:00.366 --> 01:14:05.727]  Keep up the great work and you are being recognized by those who still have their sanity.
[01:14:05.727 --> 01:14:06.688]  Isn't that good to know?
[01:14:06.688 --> 01:14:14.190]  Hey, we don't have to be on the top ten Mr. Popular list of the general public out there, the fluoride heads.
[01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:15.550]  I don't want to be on their top ten list.
[01:14:17.435 --> 01:14:24.260]  I don't want to be on their list.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.982]  I only want to be on the list of people who are into liberty and into freedom.
[01:14:27.982 --> 01:14:34.526]  And my list of people I admire is like Paul Craig Roberts, it's like Jesse Ventura, it's like Ron Paul, it's like Alex Jones.
[01:14:35.126 --> 01:14:37.688]  Right, so it's like Gerald Celente, by the way.
[01:14:37.688 --> 01:14:43.431]  And there's an update on MF Global on the Infowars.com website today, so if you want to know the latest on that.
[01:14:43.431 --> 01:14:47.754]  Wow, what an outrageous example of just complete outright theft.
[01:14:47.754 --> 01:14:50.055]  Just stealing money from people.
[01:14:50.055 --> 01:14:53.758]  Hundreds of millions of dollars, I think, is what was stolen from people, and they don't even care.
[01:14:53.758 --> 01:14:56.519]  They're like, just take it!
[01:14:56.519 --> 01:14:58.401]  We stole your money, deal with it.
[01:14:58.401 --> 01:15:00.302]  That's the new banking system in America today.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:10.896]  Next item, we have now confirmed that Walgreens is giving out iPad prizes to employees that push the most flu vaccines.
[01:15:10.896 --> 01:15:14.482]  Do you have a Walgreens graphic for those of you watching on?
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.201]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:15:33.644 --> 01:15:43.112]  Now, we covered this a couple of weeks ago here on the show, but now we've confirmed it, officially confirmed from the corporate headquarters of Walgreens, and they actually gave us a statement.
[01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:44.013]  Alright?
[01:15:44.013 --> 01:15:45.174]  So, check out this statement.
[01:15:46.389 --> 01:15:48.310]  I guess I gotta thank them for getting back in touch with us.
[01:15:48.310 --> 01:16:00.037]  They said, quote, our objective during flu season is to protect as many people as possible through the administration of flu shots as an important preventive health measure.
[01:16:00.037 --> 01:16:01.337]  It's protection now.
[01:16:01.337 --> 01:16:02.478]  Protection.
[01:16:02.478 --> 01:16:09.502]  The incentive program, they say, is one of the ways in which we encourage our employees to support this objective.
[01:16:10.302 --> 01:16:10.862]  Objective?
[01:16:10.862 --> 01:16:13.423]  It's like a military objective.
[01:16:13.423 --> 01:16:22.645]  And for our pharmacies to continue to play a leading role, a leading role in helping people stay healthy during the flu season.
[01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:31.887]  They should just say amen at the end of that or something as if they're, because it's almost like they're trying to invoke that they're following the commandments of God.
[01:16:33.527 --> 01:16:34.407]  Which they are not.
[01:16:34.407 --> 01:16:39.970]  They add, we share the recommendations of the CDC and other national health organizations.
[01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:40.651]  Oh, really?
[01:16:40.651 --> 01:16:44.052]  They follow the CDC?
[01:16:44.052 --> 01:16:46.554]  Okay, that explains it.
[01:16:46.554 --> 01:16:58.840]  You mean the CDC, who had one of their own researchers indicted by a federal grand jury in Atlanta for allegedly taking grant money and using it to buy motorcycles and cars and houses?
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.821]  That guy?
[01:17:00.821 --> 01:17:10.050]  You mean the same CDC that pushed the false fear story about the pandemic in order to sell more vaccines?
[01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:23.702]  Oh no, wait a minute, maybe you mean the CDC that was formerly headed by Dr. Julie Gerberding, who after the big swine flu scare went on and took a job as the president of Merck's Global Vaccine Division.
[01:17:23.702 --> 01:17:24.623]  Oh, that CDC!
[01:17:25.504 --> 01:17:28.566]  That's what Walgreens follows, that CDC.
[01:17:28.566 --> 01:17:35.091]  Now I see DC with vitamin C something say something on the side.
[01:17:35.091 --> 01:17:37.052]  Yeah, it's all making sense now.
[01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:43.317]  Anyway, Walgreens goes on to say, we encourage flu shots for everyone over the age of six months.
[01:17:45.011 --> 01:17:46.533]  So a 7-month-old toddler?
[01:17:46.533 --> 01:17:48.455]  How about a 19-year-old pregnant woman?
[01:17:48.455 --> 01:17:50.817]  You should get a flu shot, too!
[01:17:50.817 --> 01:17:56.603]  And if a Walgreens employee encourages you to get that flu shot, they might win an iPad.
[01:17:56.603 --> 01:17:57.844]  Oh, goody!
[01:17:57.844 --> 01:18:00.807]  More electronics from Big Brother Apple!
[01:18:01.775 --> 01:18:07.939]  Mmm, can't wait, can't wait to see what, I tell you what, next year they're gonna just pay you to take a flu shot.
[01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:09.300]  You want a flu shot, buddy?
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.602]  Here, have a 20.
[01:18:11.602 --> 01:18:14.804]  I mean, isn't Safeway giving out coupons now?
[01:18:14.804 --> 01:18:17.106]  10% off your groceries if you get a flu shot.
[01:18:17.106 --> 01:18:17.967]  That's true.
[01:18:17.967 --> 01:18:21.129]  Oh, you got the photo, right on.
[01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.990]  10% off your groceries.
[01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:27.874]  How's that a way to entice the poorest of the poor, people who can't even afford to eat?
[01:18:29.167 --> 01:18:34.616]  But if you get a flu shot, yeah, you'll save a few bucks off your macaroni and cheese!
[01:18:34.616 --> 01:18:37.020]  Oh yeah!
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.783]  Just don't buy frozen turkeys.
[01:18:38.783 --> 01:18:43.190]  They might explode in your kitchen, says Department of Homeland Security.
[01:18:45.689 --> 01:18:47.190]  It's gone crazy, folks.
[01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:53.673]  Alright, quick plug for Cornucopia, which has a very important proxy petition that you need to sign.
[01:18:53.673 --> 01:18:56.114]  Go to cornucopia.org.
[01:18:56.114 --> 01:19:00.817]  That's spelled C-O-R-N, like corn, and then U-C-O-P-I-A.
[01:19:00.817 --> 01:19:01.717]  Cornucopia.org.
[01:19:01.717 --> 01:19:04.258]  Now look, we had them on InfoWars Nightly News the other night.
[01:19:04.258 --> 01:19:05.219]  They are trying to get
[01:19:05.859 --> 01:19:10.523]  A lot of petitions sign they're going to hand deliver to the USDA next week.
[01:19:10.523 --> 01:19:12.265]  So the timing on this is urgent.
[01:19:12.265 --> 01:19:28.879]  The USDA is holding meetings that could allow organics to be polluted with new synthetic chemicals and additives that the big food conglomerate corporation dominant controllers are trying to get legalized as quote organics.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:35.023]  Oh yes, didn't you know your organic food now contains chemicals?
[01:19:35.023 --> 01:19:36.984]  Could be, unless you put up a fight.
[01:19:36.984 --> 01:19:39.665]  Sign that petition at cornucopia.org.
[01:19:39.665 --> 01:19:42.227]  And thank you for your support on that.
[01:19:42.227 --> 01:19:46.869]  Yes, I drank a chocolate superfood smoothie, so I'm feeling pretty good.
[01:19:46.869 --> 01:19:49.190]  And thank you for joining in here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.251]  We've got a lot more coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:19:51.251 --> 01:19:52.292]  I'm Mike Adams filling in.

[01:20:00.694 --> 01:20:04.675]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:08.836]  Are you gaining fat, feeling tired, losing desire in the bedroom?
[01:20:08.836 --> 01:20:10.497]  Get back in the game!

[01:21:57.006 --> 01:21:58.567]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[01:21:59.636 --> 01:22:01.637]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:01.637 --> 01:22:04.377]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:07.318]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[01:22:07.318 --> 01:22:13.320]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.040]  Here's why.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:22.242]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[01:22:22.242 --> 01:22:26.303]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:22:26.303 --> 01:22:28.644]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank.
[01:22:29.184 --> 01:22:32.187]  That can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:22:32.187 --> 01:22:33.688]  And here's the best part.
[01:22:33.688 --> 01:22:41.254]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[01:22:41.254 --> 01:22:45.538]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:45.538 --> 01:22:47.640]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.723]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[01:23:00.907 --> 01:23:06.051]  From the shattered Rust Belt come The Lost Vegas.
[01:23:06.051 --> 01:23:10.695]  Now also available in digital format at Amazon and iTunes worldwide.
[01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.518]  I think so.
[01:23:37.685 --> 01:23:51.277]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:55.101]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[01:23:55.101 --> 01:23:58.264]  Now available at Amazon.com and iTunes.
[01:24:10.939 --> 01:24:14.043]  Yeah, we're coming back with Johnny Cash!
[01:24:14.043 --> 01:24:27.178]  I gotta say, I like the intro songs that are chosen for this show.
[01:24:27.178 --> 01:24:27.838]  Welcome back!
[01:24:27.838 --> 01:24:31.442]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show on this day before Thanksgiving.
[01:24:32.879 --> 01:24:45.025]  And we do want to wish you a happy Thanksgiving from myself, Mike Adams, filling in today for Alex, but of course Alex would like to wish you a happy Thanksgiving as well and the entire crew here at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:45.025 --> 01:24:46.046]  Thank you for tuning in.
[01:24:46.046 --> 01:24:51.908]  We've got a lot more coming up for you here, a great action-packed show, an info-packed show.
[01:24:51.908 --> 01:24:53.049]  That's what we're in the business of doing.
[01:24:53.049 --> 01:24:53.789]  Who's coming up here?
[01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:57.171]  Dr. Stuart Lonkey is coming up in just a few minutes.
[01:24:57.171 --> 01:24:58.712]  He's the author of Invisible Killers.
[01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:02.476]  No, no, it's not a book about the CIA.
[01:25:02.476 --> 01:25:09.925]  It's a book about heavy metals and secret poisons that are in the environment that you probably don't know about and you need to know about.
[01:25:09.925 --> 01:25:11.507]  But we're going to give you solutions too, folks.
[01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:13.850]  We're not here just to tell you everything's dangerous.
[01:25:14.892 --> 01:25:17.193]  We'll let Napolitano do that instead.
[01:25:17.193 --> 01:25:18.793]  And we're gonna give you some solutions.
[01:25:18.793 --> 01:25:22.334]  Because we want you to be safe, we want you to be informed, we want you to be confident.
[01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:25.095]  And we want you to have good cognitive function, right?
[01:25:25.095 --> 01:25:33.697]  So you can continue to analyze the world around you and think critically about the world around you and vote with your brain engaged.
[01:25:33.697 --> 01:25:36.258]  And that's easy, all you gotta do is vote for one guy, Ron Paul.
[01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:43.076]  You don't even, you know, it doesn't take much brain power to realize that he's the only one who makes sense.
[01:25:43.076 --> 01:25:57.323]  In fact, continuing with our little theme, our little ongoing daily joke theme about vitamin C something, say something, and vitamin D population agenda, I was thinking, what other vitamins are some of the presidential candidates on?
[01:25:57.323 --> 01:25:59.624]  Because they're on something.
[01:25:59.624 --> 01:26:02.065]  Like, what is Newt Gingrich really taking?
[01:26:02.065 --> 01:26:05.547]  I think he's taking vitamin B, Trey, the Bill of Rights.
[01:26:07.714 --> 01:26:12.999]  Yeah, he's betraying the Bill of Rights and betraying the American people with his talk that you shouldn't have any rights if there's a war.
[01:26:12.999 --> 01:26:14.881]  What about Herman Cain?
[01:26:14.881 --> 01:26:20.006]  Vitamin E-Z to fool people about the Federal Reserve, right?
[01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:21.347]  So easy to fool people.
[01:26:21.347 --> 01:26:23.549]  You got some others?
[01:26:23.549 --> 01:26:24.230]  Send them on in.
[01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:25.191]  Email them to us here.
[01:26:25.191 --> 01:26:27.173]  We'll read them on the air in the next segment.
[01:26:27.173 --> 01:26:28.674]  I don't know how this got started.
[01:26:28.674 --> 01:26:31.297]  It was just completely impromptu, totally random.
[01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:34.884]  Alright.
[01:26:34.884 --> 01:26:36.346]  One other quick thing.
[01:26:36.346 --> 01:26:41.109]  I did an article last night that I wanted to talk about on the air today, but we won't have time.
[01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:48.496]  So, is this... Jared, is it up on InfoWars, the scientific medical industry cyborg article?
[01:26:48.496 --> 01:26:48.736]  You know?
[01:26:50.287 --> 01:26:52.229]  Alright, I think it's up on InfoWars.
[01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:54.512]  I put this together specifically for this show.
[01:26:54.512 --> 01:27:05.545]  In that article, which I encourage you to check out on InfoWars.com, of course, you can also find it on Natural News, I laid out the top ten things that are coming for you in the future under scientific dictatorship.
[01:27:06.366 --> 01:27:09.469]  These include things like chip implants.
[01:27:09.469 --> 01:27:11.691]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:27:11.691 --> 01:27:12.251]  It's real.
[01:27:12.251 --> 01:27:22.741]  Chip implants that can control your emotions and control you so that the police can have a pacification switch that turns off entire crowds of protesters, for example.
[01:27:22.741 --> 01:27:26.764]  Or having biometrics monitoring devices implanted into your bloodstream.
[01:27:27.879 --> 01:27:37.462]  Or implanted into your tissues where they can read your bloodstream so they can report back your biometrics, your nutritional status to the government.
[01:27:37.462 --> 01:27:40.003]  So the government can actually monitor your nutritional levels.
[01:27:40.003 --> 01:27:47.245]  They can monitor if you have, quote, too much vitamin D. Yeah, you're taking too much vitamin D. They're going to make sure you don't take that.
[01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:48.465]  They will know.
[01:27:48.465 --> 01:27:53.247]  Anyway, there are eight other things that you need to know about human cyborgs, super soldiers, other technologies.
[01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:56.087]  That could be in our future.
[01:27:56.087 --> 01:28:04.089]  They're not necessarily predictions, they're just sort of little sketches, let's say, of what is possible under scientific dictatorship.
[01:28:04.089 --> 01:28:06.530]  Because look, we've already seen GMOs.
[01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:16.492]  We've already seen vaccines go way off the charts into the world of insanity with aluminum and with mercury and with live viral material going into the vaccines.
[01:28:16.492 --> 01:28:17.033]  That's crazy.
[01:28:17.033 --> 01:28:18.573]  That's all, quote, scientific.
[01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.742]  But we don't have time for that whole discussion.
[01:28:21.742 --> 01:28:30.426]  So, gonna go on to the next topic and get ready for our guest at the bottom of the hour by talking to you about the poisoning of our world.
[01:28:30.426 --> 01:28:43.413]  Now, what really got me interested in this, you know, I'm a researcher, I'm an investigative journalist most of the time when I'm not here putting on fireman's outfits and burning turkeys for fun.
[01:28:43.413 --> 01:28:45.974]  Not fun, that was just alluding to the last segment.
[01:28:47.417 --> 01:28:50.646]  I read this article from, believe it or not, Scientific American, which
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.483]  Scientific American is mostly a very conventional, closed-minded type of magazine, in my opinion.
[01:28:57.483 --> 01:29:01.905]  They report just the official scientific truth.
[01:29:01.905 --> 01:29:10.149]  So it was very surprising to me to find Scientific American actually covering this topic, which is the toxic top 10.
[01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:16.412]  What are the top 10 most toxic things in our world that are impacting the greatest number of people in our world?
[01:29:16.412 --> 01:29:17.952]  Scientific American, believe it or not.
[01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:20.594]  And they gave us this list of 10 things.
[01:29:21.594 --> 01:29:22.195]  Mercury.
[01:29:22.195 --> 01:29:22.935]  Lead.
[01:29:22.935 --> 01:29:23.656]  Lead.
[01:29:23.656 --> 01:29:24.376]  Chromium.
[01:29:24.376 --> 01:29:24.876]  Lead.
[01:29:24.876 --> 01:29:25.197]  Lead.
[01:29:25.197 --> 01:29:26.557]  See, lead's in here multiple times.
[01:29:26.557 --> 01:29:28.099]  This is my point.
[01:29:28.099 --> 01:29:28.899]  More mercury.
[01:29:28.899 --> 01:29:29.299]  Arsenic.
[01:29:29.299 --> 01:29:29.980]  Pesticides.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.121]  Pesticides.
[01:29:31.121 --> 01:29:31.681]  More lead.
[01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:35.343]  Yeah, we're gonna come back to that.
[01:29:35.343 --> 01:29:36.664]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:36.664 --> 01:29:40.427]  We're gonna talk to you about lead, mercury poisoning, chemical poisoning, and some solutions.
[01:29:40.427 --> 01:29:42.268]  So we're having a great time here.
[01:29:42.268 --> 01:29:44.149]  Stay with us on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.950]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.014 --> 01:29:53.016]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.016 --> 01:30:01.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:07.803]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:07.803 --> 01:30:12.946]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:12.946 --> 01:30:19.689]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:27.864]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:41.961]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.961 --> 01:30:43.762]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.762 --> 01:30:46.644]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.644 --> 01:30:50.888]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:30:50.888 --> 01:30:53.270]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:55.972]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:55.972 --> 01:30:57.553]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:57.553 --> 01:30:58.354]  Got it.
[01:30:58.354 --> 01:30:59.214]  Others don't.
[01:31:00.336 --> 01:31:04.899]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.899 --> 01:31:05.799]  Number one.
[01:31:05.799 --> 01:31:09.242]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.242 --> 01:31:10.102]  Number two.
[01:31:10.102 --> 01:31:14.985]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.985 --> 01:31:15.726]  It's true.
[01:31:15.726 --> 01:31:20.609]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.609 --> 01:31:21.429]  Number three.
[01:31:21.429 --> 01:31:25.012]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:28.714]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.914 --> 01:31:29.715]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.715 --> 01:31:32.477]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.477 --> 01:31:36.160]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:36.941]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.941 --> 01:31:41.085]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.085 --> 01:31:45.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:50.314]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.314 --> 01:31:52.096]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.096 --> 01:31:54.359]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:32:01.226 --> 01:32:02.948]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:02.948 --> 01:32:08.254]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:32:08.254 --> 01:32:09.796]  Saving means to make money.
[01:32:09.796 --> 01:32:18.586]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:32:19.307 --> 01:32:26.829]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:32:26.829 --> 01:32:34.831]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:32:34.831 --> 01:32:40.073]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:32:40.073 --> 01:32:42.233]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:32:45.134 --> 01:32:45.934]  Federal agents!
[01:32:45.934 --> 01:32:46.415]  We are armed!
[01:33:16.191 --> 01:33:19.312]  Okay, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.312 --> 01:33:21.472]  What is that music?
[01:33:21.472 --> 01:33:22.452]  What is that?
[01:33:22.452 --> 01:33:25.913]  They're throwing me crazy stuff today, is what they're doing.
[01:33:25.913 --> 01:33:27.973]  They're trying to throw me off, see?
[01:33:27.973 --> 01:33:30.814]  Once you get comfortable in this chair, they play games with you.
[01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:32.094]  Trying to catch you off guard.
[01:33:33.379 --> 01:33:34.179]  Not going to let him do it.
[01:33:34.179 --> 01:33:35.740]  You hear that, Jaren?
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.101]  Alright, we are back.
[01:33:37.101 --> 01:33:44.845]  We're going to be interviewing Dr. Lonke here in just a minute, who is a toxicologist and an expert in so-called invisible killers.
[01:33:44.845 --> 01:33:51.189]  In fact, he has a book called Invisible Killers, which goes into some of the environmental causes that are preventable
[01:33:52.045 --> 01:34:00.350]  The things that cause cancer, lots of chemicals in the environment, lots of heavy metals, things that you may not be aware of and in places that you may not have thought about.
[01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:08.396]  So we're going to be asking Dr. Lonky about those kinds of questions, but let me continue with the setup on that, getting back to what I alluded to before the break.
[01:34:09.759 --> 01:34:17.024]  A Scientific American article talked about the toxic top 10 things in our world that are impacting the most people.
[01:34:17.024 --> 01:34:20.506]  And let me just read the list very quickly because you'll be surprised.
[01:34:20.506 --> 01:34:22.827]  I was shocked.
[01:34:22.827 --> 01:34:25.729]  They are, and I'm not stuttering, this is actually the list.
[01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:27.110]  It repeats.
[01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:34.975]  Number one, mercury, then lead, pesticides, lead, chromium, mercury, lead, lead, arsenic, and pesticide manufacturing.
[01:34:34.975 --> 01:34:35.555]  Those are the 10 things.
[01:34:36.636 --> 01:34:38.958]  You may have noticed lead is in there a whole lot.
[01:34:38.958 --> 01:34:49.446]  There are lead pollution from industrial processes, lead pollution from mining, lead pollution from improper battery recycling, and so on.
[01:34:49.446 --> 01:34:52.109]  We've got arsenic in groundwater.
[01:34:52.109 --> 01:35:04.398]  See, this reminds me, I love it when all the fluoride proponents say, oh, we're just going to adjust the naturally occurring fluoride levels in your water, as if to say, because it's natural, it must be good for you.
[01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.699]  Well, arsenic is natural!
[01:35:06.644 --> 01:35:08.726]  I don't want arsenic in my water, do you?
[01:35:08.726 --> 01:35:11.509]  Should we add arsenic into the water to make it more natural?
[01:35:11.509 --> 01:35:14.071]  I mean, that's the logic of the fluoride pushers.
[01:35:14.071 --> 01:35:15.472]  Should we add lead?
[01:35:15.472 --> 01:35:17.634]  Lead is natural in that sense.
[01:35:17.634 --> 01:35:20.657]  Look, just because it comes out of the ground doesn't mean it's good for you.
[01:35:20.657 --> 01:35:22.159]  Uranium comes out of the ground.
[01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:24.481]  I don't want to be taking uranium pills.
[01:35:25.876 --> 01:35:30.761]  Anyway, you gotta think about this stuff, alright?
[01:35:30.761 --> 01:35:31.783]  That's crucial.
[01:35:31.783 --> 01:35:34.325]  Anyway, that's enough of an intro.
[01:35:34.325 --> 01:35:41.193]  Diabetes is going to hit 1 in 10 Americans by 2030, according to the most recent news.
[01:35:41.193 --> 01:35:42.414]  1 in 4 U.S.
[01:35:42.414 --> 01:35:42.654]  women
[01:35:44.116 --> 01:35:45.977]  He's now on psychiatric drugs.
[01:35:45.977 --> 01:35:45.997]  25%!
[01:35:45.997 --> 01:35:48.799]  It's incredible.
[01:35:48.799 --> 01:35:51.401]  Let's get some answers from Dr. Stuart Lonke.
[01:35:51.401 --> 01:35:55.003]  He's a board-certified expert in internal medicine.
[01:35:55.003 --> 01:35:56.404]  He's in private practice right now.
[01:35:56.404 --> 01:35:59.626]  He used to be at UC, University of California, San Diego.
[01:35:59.626 --> 01:36:04.809]  He is a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health, or he was.
[01:36:04.809 --> 01:36:07.271]  I mean, that was his experience.
[01:36:07.271 --> 01:36:13.015]  And he joins us now by phone from California to help us get some answers on these environmental causes.
[01:36:14.295 --> 01:36:16.016]  I am.
[01:36:16.016 --> 01:36:21.199]  Thank you very much for having me.
[01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:31.345]  I was listening to your reading off of the list and I chuckle a little bit because I think that most people are aware of the fact that there are exposures.
[01:36:31.345 --> 01:36:32.806]  For example, let's take lead.
[01:36:33.386 --> 01:36:37.172]  I think everyone says, you know, there's not lead in paint anymore.
[01:36:37.172 --> 01:36:47.606]  And, you know, I understand the industrial exposures to lead, but I don't think that most people are aware of the fact that, you know, those people who live, for example, in inner cities,
[01:36:49.268 --> 01:36:52.269]  Where the plumbing is still lead-lined pipes.
[01:36:52.269 --> 01:36:55.610]  There's a fair amount of lead in their drinking water.
[01:36:55.610 --> 01:37:05.592]  I don't think most people are aware of the fact that many of the products that come from abroad are still painted and finished with lead-based paints.
[01:37:05.592 --> 01:37:07.532]  Like the Halloween face paints from China.
[01:37:07.532 --> 01:37:08.673]  Those had lead in them, right?
[01:37:08.673 --> 01:37:09.713]  Absolutely.
[01:37:09.713 --> 01:37:11.794]  And children's toys.
[01:37:11.794 --> 01:37:16.515]  I think that most people that live in the suburbs say, well, I've got copper plumbing.
[01:37:16.515 --> 01:37:17.415]  I'm not worried about that.
[01:37:18.544 --> 01:37:23.906]  The solder that they used to solder those pipes contained lead.
[01:37:23.906 --> 01:37:32.169]  The water that sits in your house overnight has that lead leach out of that solder into the water that you turn on in the morning.
[01:37:32.169 --> 01:37:45.613]  You see, so, no one is immune from any of this, and of course, the kinds of exposures that we talk about in Invisible Killers are the kinds of exposures that aren't related to toxic spills.
[01:37:45.613 --> 01:37:47.374]  Everyone's aware of a toxic spill.
[01:37:48.317 --> 01:38:14.864]  But the fact that you eat sushi and the fact that you're being exposed to mercury from the fish that you're eating, or if you don't eat sushi, the fact that the foods that you're eating may be from plants or even animals that drank water or that were fed on feed that came from fish that were laden with mercury.
[01:38:15.724 --> 01:38:36.259]  The fact is that almost all of us carry with us a toxic burden and what the book really focuses on is the fact that that toxic burden starts in utero and that's something that was very important for me to come to a conclusion regarding the fact that the average newborn
[01:38:37.006 --> 01:38:38.247]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.642]  That are in commercial use today.
[01:39:06.642 --> 01:39:18.431]  I won't go into the toxic substance act of 1976 and the fact that those chemicals can be out there without any previous testing regarding whether they're safe.
[01:39:18.431 --> 01:39:19.352]  Right, all grandfathered in.
[01:39:19.352 --> 01:39:20.653]  There's no testing that's required.
[01:39:20.653 --> 01:39:23.735]  The FDA does not regulate this whatsoever.
[01:39:23.735 --> 01:39:28.059]  However, of the 80,000 that are in use today,
[01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:33.793]  Some 10,000 of these chemicals weren't even in existence five years ago.
[01:39:33.793 --> 01:39:48.084]  So we continually put new chemicals into our environment, from the deodorizers that you plug into the wall in your home, to dry cleaning fluid that you bring home your clothes and hang in your closet,
[01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:49.484]  Yeah.
[01:39:49.484 --> 01:39:51.465]  But here's the thing, Doctor.
[01:40:05.393 --> 01:40:07.174]  Dr. Lunkie, sorry to interrupt, but here's the thing.
[01:40:07.174 --> 01:40:22.804]  Most people out there believe that if all these chemicals are being used in these products, if California, for example, requires these flame retardants to be on these infant mattresses, then they must be safe, because the government would not allow these chemicals and these metals to be used in products if they weren't proven safe.
[01:40:22.804 --> 01:40:29.929]  But your position, and what's available in your book, Invisible Killers, and I think the website for that is InvisibleKillers.com, correct?
[01:40:29.929 --> 01:40:30.349]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:40:30.569 --> 01:40:46.554]  Okay, but your book and your position is that these are not, they've never been proven safe, they are a very provable threat to health, and that we need to be looking at preventing cancer as much as we look at treating it after the fact, right?
[01:40:46.934 --> 01:41:00.511]  Absolutely, and I think that one of the things that we will be coming out with very shortly, and I told you before we went on the air, is our very next project is going to be called, it's going to be Clear Beginnings.
[01:41:01.272 --> 01:41:11.896]  Because what we're really talking about here is the fact that the FDA has no regulatory authority over the chemicals that are used in the marketplace.
[01:41:11.896 --> 01:41:15.117]  That's a Federal Trade Commission regulation.
[01:41:15.117 --> 01:41:19.879]  And the Toxic Substance Act of 1976 says that's quite all right.
[01:41:19.879 --> 01:41:26.121]  Now, some of your listeners may be aware of the fact that there's a large group of people in Congress right now on a bill
[01:41:26.821 --> 01:41:26.961]  Oh yeah.
[01:41:52.566 --> 01:42:08.648]  That there are chemicals and plastics and so on and so forth that reach into baby bottles, into the food, and that all of our soup cans and baby food cans are... Yeah, 1,200% higher BPA levels in the blood of people who eat canned soup.
[01:42:08.928 --> 01:42:09.949]  That's right.
[01:42:09.949 --> 01:42:29.262]  And we know that this phenol A, that BPA, there are hundreds of articles talking about the cellular effect, the hormone emulation effect, the potentially carcinogenic effect through modulation of the immune system.
[01:42:29.262 --> 01:42:35.206]  All of these data are such that Canada, for example, very quickly outlawed its use in baby bottles.
[01:42:35.866 --> 01:42:45.829]  However, here in the United States, the chemical industry has an extraordinarily strong lobby, and it's been nearly impossible to get anything done.
[01:42:45.829 --> 01:42:52.951]  I think here in California, we finally said that BPA has to be out of baby bottles and out of baby food by 2013.
[01:42:54.751 --> 01:43:04.098]  But it's extraordinary that there are very few people, such as yourself and Dr. Samuel Epstein, who are raising the alarm about these chemicals.
[01:43:04.098 --> 01:43:17.448]  The cancer industry, the conventional cancer industry, I'm saying, they don't say a word about the toxic chemicals in cosmetics and personal care products and foods and medicines and fire retardant chemicals.
[01:43:17.448 --> 01:43:21.731]  So, I mean, why are they so silent about all of this, in your opinion, Dr. Long?
[01:43:22.278 --> 01:43:28.900]  Well, I think a lot of it has to do with an insistence on scientific proof and scientific methodology.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:34.602]  As physicians, we are kind of brought up on the drug company regimen.
[01:43:34.602 --> 01:43:44.805]  That is, you do a double-blind study and you prove without a shadow of a doubt that a certain chemical causes a certain effect.
[01:43:45.365 --> 01:43:46.926]  And you do that over and over again.
[01:43:46.926 --> 01:43:50.248]  Well, I don't think we're going to get too many volunteers for those studies.
[01:43:50.248 --> 01:43:55.572]  And when we do it in animal models, some people scoff at that.
[01:43:55.572 --> 01:44:06.539]  But I think that there's a great lack of enthusiasm for it because it doesn't fall into the realm of the kind of thing that most doctors know what to do about.
[01:44:06.539 --> 01:44:10.862]  Doctors feel really comfortable when they know what to do about something.
[01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:15.150]  Yeah, that's a good point, but look, I think you could get a whole bunch of volunteers in America.
[01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:19.112]  You just give them 10% off their groceries and they'll inject themselves with anything.
[01:44:19.112 --> 01:44:19.692]  I'm serious.
[01:44:19.692 --> 01:44:26.034]  You give them a free iPad drawing and they'll take some lead, they'll take some mercury, because they don't know anything about this.
[01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:34.517]  Let's go back to the lead because you mentioned it so many times in your discussion.
[01:44:34.517 --> 01:44:41.880]  There are so many wonderful articles now that make us understand, for example, doctors will treat toxic lead levels.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:53.784]  We get an alarm when 10 micrograms or greater are in the blood and we say that above 20 micrograms, you need to actually be treating somebody with chelating agents and removing the lead.
[01:44:54.544 --> 01:44:59.049]  There was a study that was done in the University of Cincinnati, published in 2008.
[01:44:59.049 --> 01:45:01.071]  It's a wonderful study.
[01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:08.179]  They followed 250 women from their pregnancy, and they followed their children for 20 years.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.683]  And all of these were inner-city individuals, women.
[01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:18.405]  They all gave birth and obviously they tracked the lead levels.
[01:45:18.405 --> 01:45:26.370]  They tracked bone lead levels by x-ray diffraction as well as blood lead levels.
[01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:30.212]  And they followed these kids until they were 5 or 6 years old.
[01:45:30.212 --> 01:45:32.294]  And then they followed them until they became 20.
[01:45:32.294 --> 01:45:37.737]  And they were able to show that with lead levels that no one would treat,
[01:45:38.377 --> 01:45:39.138]  You follow me?
[01:45:39.138 --> 01:45:40.119]  Yeah, right.
[01:45:40.119 --> 01:45:42.601]  Some clinical lead levels.
[01:45:42.601 --> 01:45:51.890]  If you divide them into quartiles, 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, and 15 to 20, you could draw a straight line with the incidence of violent crime.
[01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:58.814]  Have there been studies done of lead levels of criminals who are currently being incarcerated?
[01:45:58.814 --> 01:45:59.214]  Absolutely.
[01:45:59.214 --> 01:46:05.220]  And there's correlations with lead levels, because lead concentrates not only in the bone, but in the brain.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:08.383]  See, this gets to my... And so, let me make one very important point.
[01:46:08.383 --> 01:46:09.444]  Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
[01:46:09.444 --> 01:46:13.748]  And that is, all of what we're saying, all of this, what does it really mean?
[01:46:14.249 --> 01:46:16.170]  And what it really means is this.
[01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:22.874]  It's unlikely that we're going to legislate away all of these 80,000 chemicals.
[01:46:22.874 --> 01:46:30.419]  It's unlikely that we're going to begin to test all of the 80,000 chemicals in current use.
[01:46:30.419 --> 01:46:40.525]  We just have to accept the fact that if I took 100 people and I tested them right now, measuring bone levels and fat levels, because all of these organic chemicals are soluble in fat,
[01:46:41.245 --> 01:46:43.306]  Right, it's just getting worse in society.
[01:47:10.606 --> 01:47:13.076]  The greatest breakthrough is birth control pills.
[01:47:13.076 --> 01:47:15.406]  Today, we have fertility clinics.
[01:47:19.155 --> 01:47:19.896]  We're good to go.
[01:47:42.396 --> 01:47:44.677]  Childbearing age women, yeah.
[01:47:44.677 --> 01:47:46.497]  Well, but that's the thing.
[01:47:46.497 --> 01:47:56.320]  You've raised some fantastic points, and I want to just remind the listeners that you're listening to an interview with Dr. Stuart Lonke, the author of Invisible Killers
[01:48:11.425 --> 01:48:13.346]  His website is InvisibleKillers.com.
[01:48:13.346 --> 01:48:28.109]  We're going to continue this interview here on the Alex Jones Show, and in fact, if you're interested, if you'd like to call in and maybe ask a question of Dr. Lonke, we're going to open up the phones at 800-259-9231, so you can call in after this upcoming break.
[01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:38.132]  But you mentioned, Dr. Lonke, the correlation between lead presence in bone and tissues and violent crime, or at least incarceration for crimes.
[01:48:38.732 --> 01:48:45.194]  This brings me to the psychological and behavioral component of exposure to these heavy metals.
[01:48:45.194 --> 01:48:47.775]  This is what interests me in particular.
[01:48:47.775 --> 01:48:50.416]  Well, it's a big factor.
[01:48:50.416 --> 01:48:52.857]  Lead and mercury are the two, you know, the hatters.
[01:48:52.857 --> 01:48:54.177]  You ever hear of the mad hatter?
[01:48:54.177 --> 01:48:54.437]  Sure.
[01:48:54.437 --> 01:49:01.560]  I'm sure your listeners are aware of the fact that's because they lined felt hats with mercury in the old days and the hatters used to lick their brushes.
[01:49:02.961 --> 01:49:06.383]  Yeah, yeah, it'll drive you insane, but this is my question.
[01:49:06.383 --> 01:49:16.909]  Do you think that at least some portion of the insanity that we see across modern culture today is caused by this exposure to heavy metals?
[01:49:16.909 --> 01:49:18.510]  Undoubtedly.
[01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:22.792]  There is not one ounce of scientific doubt in my mind.
[01:49:22.792 --> 01:49:24.613]  I think that it is one of the factors.
[01:49:25.834 --> 01:49:26.014]  Sure.
[01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:50.575]  Medical abnormalities, the obesity epidemic, obesity in kids.
[01:49:50.575 --> 01:50:05.608]  Now maybe your listeners will understand, if you're born with all of these chemicals that are hormone emulators and stack the deck against you metabolizing glucose normally, why wouldn't these kids get diabetes earlier?
[01:50:08.151 --> 01:50:10.993]  Well, and why wouldn't our prisons be filled with criminals?
[01:50:10.993 --> 01:50:15.557]  And doesn't this call into question the entire so-called criminal justice system?
[01:50:15.557 --> 01:50:29.709]  If punishing people for their, quote, behavior by throwing them in prison without treating some of what might be the causes, chemicals or metals poisoning, isn't that a completely incomplete and in fact an unjust system of justice?
[01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.870]  Yes.
[01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:37.656]  I think that the legal system, like the political system, are very, very difficult places to crack.
[01:50:37.656 --> 01:50:45.103]  I think we have to do this as a grassroots movement of education of young people, their parents and grandparents.
[01:50:45.103 --> 01:50:46.644]  Alright, Dr. Lonke, we gotta go to break.
[01:50:46.644 --> 01:50:47.465]  I'm sorry to cut you off.
[01:50:47.465 --> 01:50:48.546]  Please stay with us, though.
[01:50:48.546 --> 01:50:53.931]  We'll be right back in a couple of minutes with more from Dr. Stuart Lonke here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:53.931 --> 01:50:55.252]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:01.042 --> 01:51:06.404]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[01:51:06.404 --> 01:51:12.805]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[01:51:12.805 --> 01:51:17.627]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[01:51:17.627 --> 01:51:21.188]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video
[01:51:21.648 --> 01:51:27.031]  Inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[01:51:27.031 --> 01:51:36.495]  The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[01:51:36.495 --> 01:51:41.137]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[01:51:41.377 --> 01:51:46.783]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots have already seen in the last four months.
[01:51:46.783 --> 01:51:48.024]  Prepare now.

[01:53:12.384 --> 01:53:14.626]  Storable vitamins and nutritional supplements.
[01:53:15.486 --> 01:53:18.949]  Most foods do not contain the essential micronutrients your body needs.
[01:53:18.949 --> 01:53:24.873]  You need Survival RX, the world's first ultra-long-term storable vitamins and nutritional supplements.

[01:54:17.512 --> 01:54:22.236]  Oh yes, we are back on this November 23rd, the day before Thanksgiving.
[01:54:22.236 --> 01:54:23.778]  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.
[01:54:23.778 --> 01:54:31.665]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the Alex Jones Show here and tripping up my words just a little bit.
[01:54:31.665 --> 01:54:32.766]  But I hope you're enjoying the show.
[01:54:32.766 --> 01:54:34.567]  We are interviewing Dr. Stuart Lonke.
[01:54:35.288 --> 01:54:41.191]  Who is an expert in internal medicine and toxicology, and he was mentioning some of the food sources.
[01:54:41.191 --> 01:54:42.932]  He mentioned a lot of people eating sushi.
[01:54:42.932 --> 01:54:44.372]  Now, I don't know about you, Dr. Lonky.
[01:54:44.372 --> 01:54:45.433]  I don't eat sushi.
[01:54:45.433 --> 01:54:49.315]  I only eat fire-bombed turkeys air-dropped into vats of boiling oil.
[01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:54.753]  That is my diet that's DHS compliant.
[01:54:54.753 --> 01:55:03.220]  I think I should make people be aware of the fact that you can't get away from this.
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:10.646]  You talked about arsenic, you talked about arsenic in water, but how many people out there listening to your show have wood decks?
[01:55:10.646 --> 01:55:12.107]  Have wood swing sets?
[01:55:12.107 --> 01:55:13.528]  Pressure-treated wood, yeah.
[01:55:14.855 --> 01:55:15.655]  We're good to go.
[01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.929]  We're good.
[01:55:56.018 --> 01:55:57.358]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:55:57.358 --> 01:56:04.121]  When you ingest these toxins, I want to get to what, in your research, in your experience, what kinds of effects do you see?
[01:56:04.121 --> 01:56:05.441]  Are people hallucinating?
[01:56:05.441 --> 01:56:07.202]  Do they hear sounds of chirping birds?
[01:56:07.202 --> 01:56:10.763]  Do they think, do they make bad decisions about elections?
[01:56:10.763 --> 01:56:12.204]  I mean, what is really the impact?
[01:56:14.085 --> 01:56:15.405]  I won't touch that one.
[01:56:15.405 --> 01:56:18.526]  But I think that, you know, I think they're so subtle.
[01:56:18.526 --> 01:56:22.507]  Mike, that's the thing that's important for people to understand.
[01:56:22.507 --> 01:56:25.688]  People get stomachaches more frequently.
[01:56:25.688 --> 01:56:30.330]  They tend to have more constipation and then some diarrhea.
[01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:34.491]  And they tend to have nausea episodes.
[01:56:34.491 --> 01:56:37.092]  They tend to get muscle aches and pains.
[01:56:37.092 --> 01:56:39.212]  They are so nondescript.
[01:56:39.212 --> 01:56:41.693]  They are so nonspecific.
[01:56:42.657 --> 01:56:42.877]  I think
[01:57:12.757 --> 01:57:14.259]  They don't say that.
[01:57:14.259 --> 01:57:19.484]  What percentage of the US Congress do you think is suffering from heavy metals toxicity?
[01:57:19.484 --> 01:57:19.984]  I gotta ask!
[01:57:19.984 --> 01:57:23.888]  The US Congress is suffering from a significant amount of toxicity.
[01:57:23.888 --> 01:57:25.950]  But we all are.
[01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:28.993]  And the fact is, it's happening in percentage.
[01:57:30.615 --> 01:57:32.717]  It happens generationally.
[01:57:32.717 --> 01:57:33.777]  It's easy.
[01:57:33.777 --> 01:57:54.172]  Hindsight is really 20-20, and that's why when we look at the data, we look at epidemiologic data, and we say it's unreasonable that the incidence of autism and behavioral deficit or attention deficit, and I call it behavioral deficit because it's more than just
[01:57:55.708 --> 01:57:57.209]  The whole behavior.
[01:57:57.209 --> 01:58:01.032]  You see these hyperactive kids and I watch it all the time.
[01:58:01.032 --> 01:58:02.193]  It's very interesting.
[01:58:02.193 --> 01:58:07.237]  My daughter, my younger daughter, detoxed for a year before she even got pregnant.
[01:58:07.237 --> 01:58:08.958]  All through her pregnancy.
[01:58:08.958 --> 01:58:14.983]  And I watch my grandson, who's three, and his behavior contrasted with other three-year-olds.
[01:58:14.983 --> 01:58:16.404]  Quick question because we're almost out of time.
[01:58:16.404 --> 01:58:18.786]  Does your book offer people some solutions for detox?
[01:58:20.652 --> 01:58:28.939]  There are a handful and a growing number, and there are some extraordinarily effective ways that we can begin to detox.
[01:58:28.939 --> 01:58:31.461]  We need to figure out ways to bring that to people.
[01:58:31.461 --> 01:58:31.721]  All right.
[01:58:31.721 --> 01:58:32.362]  All right.
[01:58:32.362 --> 01:58:33.142]  We've got to go to break.
[01:58:33.142 --> 01:58:34.263]  Dr. Lonky, thank you.
[01:58:34.263 --> 01:58:34.944]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:34.944 --> 01:58:36.365]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[01:58:36.365 --> 01:58:38.467]  I'll give you some more solutions on the other side of this break.
[01:58:38.467 --> 01:58:38.847]  Thank you.
[01:58:38.847 --> 01:58:41.369]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.369 --> 01:58:44.852]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.852 --> 01:58:47.034]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:52.088 --> 01:58:56.110]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:59.351]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:04.153]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.153 --> 01:59:10.536]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.536 --> 01:59:12.777]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.317 --> 01:59:13.617]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.617 --> 01:59:14.118]  Bernanke?
[01:59:14.118 --> 01:59:14.939]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.939 --> 01:59:16.040]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.323]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.219 --> 01:59:34.340]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:39.504]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.504 --> 01:59:53.833]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:53.833 --> 01:59:56.215]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.215 --> 01:59:58.977]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:10.382]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.382 --> 02:00:11.982]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.982 --> 02:00:13.543]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.543 --> 02:00:17.724]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.724 --> 02:00:21.785]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.712 --> 02:00:26.712]  All right, welcome back.
[02:00:26.712 --> 02:00:35.714]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today here on the Alex Jones Show, Wednesday, November 22nd, 2011, the day before Thanksgiving.
[02:00:35.714 --> 02:00:38.115]  So, happy Thanksgiving to all of you out there.
[02:00:38.115 --> 02:00:42.716]  And of course, be sure to practice caution in your kitchen this Thanksgiving.
[02:00:42.716 --> 02:00:46.957]  Don't set anything on fire because the firemen need to be at home with their families this Thanksgiving.
[02:00:47.827 --> 02:00:49.988]  They've had a rough summer of it here in Texas.
[02:00:49.988 --> 02:00:52.349]  Let's give them some time off.
[02:00:52.349 --> 02:01:01.434]  You know, along those lines, hey, don't wrap your Christmas trees in hot lights and bad electrical wiring.
[02:01:01.434 --> 02:01:03.875]  And then set it in the middle of your house like a firebomb.
[02:01:04.949 --> 02:01:08.674]  I bet you we're going to get a warning from DHS about that.
[02:01:08.674 --> 02:01:11.618]  Don't put a Christmas tree in your house.
[02:01:11.618 --> 02:01:13.159]  Yeah, it's going to be an official tweet.
[02:01:13.159 --> 02:01:17.144]  It's another weapon of terror, according to DHS.
[02:01:17.144 --> 02:01:18.326]  That's my prediction.
[02:01:18.326 --> 02:01:19.688]  They haven't done it yet.
[02:01:19.688 --> 02:01:21.009]  Let's not give them any ideas.
[02:01:22.281 --> 02:01:24.462]  They're just going to ruin Christmas, aren't they?
[02:01:24.462 --> 02:01:28.402]  They're going to unwrap all your presents at the airport.
[02:01:28.402 --> 02:01:31.903]  Not because there's anything dangerous in there, just because they're curious.
[02:01:31.903 --> 02:01:34.084]  They just want to unwrap stuff.
[02:01:34.084 --> 02:01:36.564]  They just want to destroy stuff.
[02:01:36.564 --> 02:01:39.805]  They want to get the Christmas tree out of your house, get the turkey out of your kitchen.
[02:01:39.805 --> 02:01:44.766]  Just make you have a really rough and tough holiday so you remember who's in charge.
[02:01:44.766 --> 02:01:45.066]  Right?
[02:01:45.066 --> 02:01:46.287]  That's what they're after.
[02:01:46.287 --> 02:01:50.808]  Anyway, we just finished a segment with Dr. Stuart Lonke, the author of Invisible Killers.
[02:01:51.826 --> 02:01:53.647]  And that was my first time interviewing Dr. Lonke.
[02:01:53.647 --> 02:02:02.293]  I don't know him personally, but he came up as the guy to talk to about that topic, and I know we did not get to solutions yet, so I want to share some of those with you.
[02:02:02.293 --> 02:02:08.396]  Also, we did not get to your calls, and I apologize, the call screen system is not up here right now.
[02:02:08.396 --> 02:02:09.237]  We're working on that.
[02:02:09.237 --> 02:02:12.159]  I do intend to take some of your calls in this hour.
[02:02:13.004 --> 02:02:14.986]  So feel free to call in with some comments.
[02:02:14.986 --> 02:02:15.866]  Hopefully we get that working.
[02:02:15.866 --> 02:02:17.248]  I'm not ignoring your calls.
[02:02:17.248 --> 02:02:18.829]  That's my message to you.
[02:02:18.829 --> 02:02:20.470]  Trying to get that up and running.
[02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:35.163]  But in the last segment, we talked to Dr. Lonti who, you know, I think we could talk to him for hours about the real hardcore information about heavy metals poisoning and the toxicity that is infecting the minds of the American people.
[02:02:36.189 --> 02:02:58.556]  And I've got a working theory on this, that part of the insanity that has infected America today, the reason why you have presidential debates where people make no sense, why you have leadership at the executive level that is saying, we need to spend a few trillion more dollars to get us out of the trillions in debt we're already in.
[02:02:58.556 --> 02:03:00.357]  Yeah, that's kind of insane.
[02:03:00.357 --> 02:03:04.198]  That's pure clinical insanity, if you think about it.
[02:03:05.298 --> 02:03:11.404]  As Gerald Cilenti, I'm sure, would have a few comments about the insanity going on at MF Global today.
[02:03:11.404 --> 02:03:13.927]  These days, it's pretty much insane.
[02:03:13.927 --> 02:03:15.728]  But why is it so insane?
[02:03:15.728 --> 02:03:20.733]  So I asked Dr. Lonke, do you think members of Congress are suffering from heavy metals toxicity?
[02:03:20.733 --> 02:03:23.436]  And he said yes, and he thinks everybody is.
[02:03:23.436 --> 02:03:28.721]  But I bet you, if you were to go into Congress and have them subject themselves to blood tests,
[02:03:29.907 --> 02:03:31.529]  Wouldn't that be interesting?
[02:03:31.529 --> 02:03:37.555]  You might find some non-human DNA in the mix there, according to David Icke, right?
[02:03:37.555 --> 02:03:41.499]  But you would definitely find some heavy metals in that mix.
[02:03:41.499 --> 02:03:45.003]  Probably a lot of lead, a lot of arsenic, a lot of mercury.
[02:03:45.003 --> 02:03:48.827]  Everybody who voted for the Patriot Act is probably suffering from lead poisoning.
[02:03:50.017 --> 02:03:51.518]  No, I don't mean from bullets.
[02:03:51.518 --> 02:03:52.259]  I know what you're thinking.
[02:03:52.259 --> 02:03:57.062]  No, I mean from their food, from the lead in their pipes, from that thing.
[02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:58.523]  Other sources of lead.
[02:03:58.523 --> 02:04:00.444]  Or mercury poisoning.
[02:04:00.444 --> 02:04:16.356]  Because their moms, let's say, yes they do have mothers, their moms were eating tuna fish when they were pregnant and the mercury went through the blood and got into the developing minds of the little infant fetuses that were going to be born and someday become senators.
[02:04:17.304 --> 02:04:18.687]  So now they're insane.
[02:04:18.687 --> 02:04:20.149]  But they're in charge!
[02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:21.431]  That's scary.
[02:04:21.431 --> 02:04:23.114]  That's kind of disturbing, actually.
[02:04:23.114 --> 02:04:25.178]  Let's not, uh, let's not let that happen.
[02:04:25.178 --> 02:04:26.039]  Let's get healthy.
[02:04:26.039 --> 02:04:26.881]  Let's detox.
[02:04:26.881 --> 02:04:27.702]  And along those lines...
[02:04:28.809 --> 02:04:33.011]  Just from my own experience, I'm not, I'm, oh man, got a break coming up.
[02:04:33.011 --> 02:04:36.292]  Very quickly, avoid exposure to heavy metals.
[02:04:36.292 --> 02:04:38.393]  Eat lots of fibrous foods.
[02:04:38.393 --> 02:04:46.216]  Apples contain pectin, juice, a lot of vegetables, chlorella and cilantro bind to heavy metals and help carry them out of your body.
[02:04:46.216 --> 02:04:50.557]  So does grapefruit pectin and other natural fibers.
[02:04:50.557 --> 02:04:51.618]  Detox yourself!
[02:04:52.406 --> 02:04:55.810]  Get those heavy metals out of your body and out of your brain, and you will make better decisions as a result.
[02:04:55.810 --> 02:04:59.854]  We'll talk more about that on the other side of this break, as we are joined by Robert Scott Bell.

[02:06:00.797 --> 02:06:08.902]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.902 --> 02:06:11.464]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.464 --> 02:06:16.847]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.847 --> 02:06:19.889]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.889 --> 02:06:21.950]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.190 --> 02:06:28.454]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.454 --> 02:06:31.816]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.816 --> 02:06:37.600]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:39.241]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.241 --> 02:06:40.542]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.542 --> 02:06:43.224]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:43.224 --> 02:06:47.446]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.446 --> 02:06:49.468]  You can find the video at www.
[02:06:50.228 --> 02:06:52.049]  End of America 3.com.
[02:06:52.049 --> 02:06:53.189]  That's End of America.
[02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:54.650]  The number 3.com.

[02:07:01.633 --> 02:07:03.333]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.333 --> 02:07:08.656]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:08.656 --> 02:07:10.176]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:10.176 --> 02:07:18.960]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:19.700 --> 02:07:27.244]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:27.244 --> 02:07:35.248]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:35.248 --> 02:07:40.471]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:07:45.353 --> 02:07:47.954]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:47.954 --> 02:07:49.674]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.776 --> 02:08:17.820]  Welcome back, patriots and heroes of the free world.
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:22.283]  We are engaged in our worldwide transmission here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:22.283 --> 02:08:25.666]  I'm the filled-in host today, Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:08:25.666 --> 02:08:29.369]  Yeah, editor of naturalnews.com and an occasional host here.
[02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:41.417]  And we've been having a great time with you today, talking about all kinds of heavy metals, poisoning, and ways you can avoid that and get that out of your body because it affects the minds of men and women.
[02:08:41.417 --> 02:08:50.904]  And shortly, we're going to be joined by Robert Scott Bell, and we're going to talk about our list of things that you can be thankful for, the things that we're thankful for, this Thanksgiving.
[02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:55.391]  It is actually a holiday of giving thanks, so let's do that.
[02:08:55.391 --> 02:08:58.432]  Let's give some gratitude out there where it is due.
[02:08:58.432 --> 02:09:05.814]  And we'd like to take your calls during this hour, so please call us at 800-259-9231.
[02:09:05.814 --> 02:09:06.854]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:09:06.854 --> 02:09:11.575]  We'll get you on the board and we'll get your calls in.
[02:09:11.575 --> 02:09:15.556]  And just before we get to Robert Scott Bell here finishing up that last segment, I do believe
[02:09:16.758 --> 02:09:22.374]  I do believe that the insanity that we are witnessing today with the Federal Reserve, with the presidential debates.
[02:09:22.374 --> 02:09:24.560]  Remember when Rick Perry couldn't remember the third thing?
[02:09:25.444 --> 02:09:27.845]  The third department of government that he was going to cut?
[02:09:27.845 --> 02:09:30.307]  I think that could be a mercury side effect.
[02:09:30.307 --> 02:09:32.148]  I mean, he was the one pushing the vaccines.
[02:09:32.148 --> 02:09:33.249]  Gardasil.
[02:09:33.249 --> 02:09:34.850]  Did he take some Gardasil himself?
[02:09:34.850 --> 02:09:35.850]  I don't know.
[02:09:35.850 --> 02:09:40.653]  But I bet he took some other vaccines and might be suffering from some metals.
[02:09:40.653 --> 02:09:42.234]  It's metals poisoning himself.
[02:09:42.234 --> 02:09:45.976]  It's just, you know, look, I don't have his medical records, so I don't know for sure.
[02:09:45.976 --> 02:09:50.239]  But it is a possibility that these people who can't think rationally
[02:09:51.079 --> 02:09:55.222]  And can't speak without a teleprompter that they may be suffering from heavy metals poisoning.
[02:09:55.222 --> 02:09:57.063]  I can only imagine a U.S.
[02:09:57.063 --> 02:10:03.268]  Senator suffering from high levels of lead and cadmium and arsenic and mercury thinking to himself,
[02:10:04.561 --> 02:10:15.191]  Let's pass a Patriot Act Version 2, and let's catch criminals by reaching down their pants, and then we'll take some time off from the Senate.
[02:10:15.191 --> 02:10:23.619]  Pickler's Fortnite, and I'll go take a long walk off a short pier, and at my feet I will discover Patriot Act Version 3, and we'll enact that!
[02:10:23.619 --> 02:10:26.341]  That's the level of insanity that I'm talking about.
[02:10:26.341 --> 02:10:26.922]  Just complete
[02:10:28.203 --> 02:10:32.207]  Cats and dogs living together, quote Bill Murray.
[02:10:32.207 --> 02:10:34.770]  Total insanity out there.
[02:10:34.770 --> 02:10:42.358]  But let's move on to something a little more sane and a little more, let's say, humbling this holiday season.
[02:10:42.358 --> 02:10:43.520]  Things to be thankful for.
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:45.161]  And for that segment, we are joined
[02:10:45.802 --> 02:10:56.209]  By none other than Robert Scott Bell, who also is a radio host on the Genesis Communications Network, and he just did a fantastic interview with Governor Jesse Ventura that aired a couple of days ago.
[02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:58.311]  Robert is joining us by Skype.
[02:10:58.311 --> 02:11:01.033]  Robert, are you with us?
[02:11:01.033 --> 02:11:02.734]  Are you there?
[02:11:02.734 --> 02:11:04.475]  Hello!
[02:11:04.475 --> 02:11:06.617]  Are you on?
[02:11:06.617 --> 02:11:08.278]  Okay, Robert, can you hear me?
[02:11:08.278 --> 02:11:08.958]  Mike, you there?
[02:11:08.958 --> 02:11:10.880]  Yes, I can hear you.
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:11.620]  Good to hear your voice, man.
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:13.221]  How you doing?
[02:11:13.221 --> 02:11:14.883]  I apologize, I'm not hearing any audio.
[02:11:15.851 --> 02:11:17.931]  Okay, we'll get that hooked up here.
[02:11:17.931 --> 02:11:18.611]  I got you, Mike.
[02:11:18.611 --> 02:11:19.472]  Now I can hear you.
[02:11:19.472 --> 02:11:20.392]  All right, great.
[02:11:20.392 --> 02:11:25.693]  I thought maybe a little bit of mercury was affecting me there for a moment, but now I realize I'm totally sane.
[02:11:25.693 --> 02:11:26.993]  So go ahead.
[02:11:26.993 --> 02:11:27.813]  You're good.
[02:11:27.813 --> 02:11:29.773]  I'm definitely not bringing any mercury today.
[02:11:29.773 --> 02:11:32.954]  If anything, I'd be bringing some mercury detox with me.
[02:11:32.954 --> 02:11:34.554]  Yeah, what do you think, by the way, on that?
[02:11:34.554 --> 02:11:39.995]  Before we get into the Thanksgiving list, you have actually studied a lot of detox.
[02:11:39.995 --> 02:11:44.856]  What are the top detoxification techniques in your experience for getting rid of heavy metals?
[02:11:45.765 --> 02:11:47.686]  Well, yeah, it's a great topic.
[02:11:47.686 --> 02:11:48.947]  We covered a lot on the show.
[02:11:48.947 --> 02:11:53.831]  There's always more questions, ten more every time you bring up one of the solutions or ten of them.
[02:11:53.831 --> 02:12:02.077]  And, of course, my background in energetic homeopathic medicine after being raised allopathically or pharmaceutically, having to undo so much of the damage of modern medicine.
[02:12:02.997 --> 02:12:07.480]  I think one of the most important things to understand is that there's an energy to every metal.
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:09.942]  And we've covered this, you and I, too.
[02:12:09.942 --> 02:12:13.464]  And, of course, the metabolism of the body deals, we're dealing with energy.
[02:12:13.464 --> 02:12:16.185]  And, of course, identifying these toxic metals is one thing.
[02:12:16.185 --> 02:12:26.552]  And for many of us who've been exposed, for instance, to mercury through dental fillings or through vaccination or other environmental exposures, there's been so much over time, albeit a small amount over time,
[02:12:27.052 --> 02:12:33.237]  Yeah, it's like being slowly poisoned by a virus or let's say a bacteria living in your gut that's been genetically modified and it's churning out BT toxin in your own digestive tract.
[02:12:33.237 --> 02:12:34.398]  I mean, it's that bad, right?
[02:12:51.973 --> 02:12:57.276]  Yeah, it really is like walking through life with a big heavy lead mercury anchor.
[02:12:57.276 --> 02:13:02.739]  You wouldn't be moving anywhere very quickly and pretty soon it would wear you down basically.
[02:13:02.739 --> 02:13:06.061]  And that's what we're talking about with these heavy metals among many things that happen.
[02:13:07.322 --> 02:13:11.864]  So, I obviously go to the ultimate non-conventionality, which would be energy medicine.
[02:13:11.864 --> 02:13:13.024]  Of course, homeopathy.
[02:13:13.024 --> 02:13:19.386]  I know a lot of people that are materialists and reductionists are not in favor of it, although it's completely harmless.
[02:13:19.386 --> 02:13:20.907]  Some would say, well, there's nothing there.
[02:13:20.907 --> 02:13:22.167]  We can get into discussion of that.
[02:13:22.167 --> 02:13:32.971]  But I found it to be most profound in terms of assisting all of the other botanical and chelating agents from nature, the synthetic nutrients that are used in aggressive
[02:13:33.611 --> 02:13:43.236]  Urgent care in medicine when they do intravenous chelation, but the missing element typically is the homeopathic signatures, whether it be homeopathic mercurious, which is mercury.
[02:13:43.236 --> 02:13:46.098]  We can do it with lead, which is plumbum metallicum.
[02:13:46.098 --> 02:13:48.179]  We can do it with arsenic, with arsenicum albumin.
[02:13:48.179 --> 02:13:58.765]  We can literally pick any metal that is toxic and shouldn't be in the body and address it homeopathically in conjunction with support for the excretory pathways of the body.
[02:13:58.925 --> 02:14:21.773]  Alright, so you're not saying, if you're suffering a highly toxic level of acute lead poisoning, you're not saying just treat it with homeopathy, you're saying, you know, in the emergency room they'll do the IV chelation, they will do maybe some other medicines, but then in addition to that you can do some botanical approaches and you can do homeopathic approaches which have zero negative side effects anyway to assist in that.
[02:14:22.338 --> 02:14:23.258]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:23.258 --> 02:14:25.019]  I think you only have a plus factor.
[02:14:25.019 --> 02:14:32.341]  I mean, if you realize the energy it takes to address and mobilize the defenses to bind and get this stuff out of your system, you'll want every advantage you have.
[02:14:32.341 --> 02:14:35.182]  So, at the very least, homeopathic adjuncts.
[02:14:35.182 --> 02:14:39.743]  And that would also go with remedies that specifically support liver-kidney pathways.
[02:14:39.743 --> 02:14:47.806]  You may have already discussed this, but I think one of the other things to reduce the burden on the liver and kidneys with these metals is far-infrared healing light-type technologies.
[02:14:48.306 --> 02:14:49.668]  Oh yeah, that's great.
[02:14:49.668 --> 02:14:51.450]  It helps you sweat out toxins.
[02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:57.499]  Yeah, except if you overdo the sweat lodge situation, in which case you pass out and die as happened.
[02:14:57.499 --> 02:15:00.643]  Who was the guru guy that had the sweat lodge deaths?
[02:15:00.643 --> 02:15:03.687]  I don't remember his name, but he just got sentenced to a number of years.
[02:15:03.687 --> 02:15:04.027]  Oh man.
[02:15:04.688 --> 02:15:14.630]  And that's why we have to be diligent and vigilant, if you will, about even the natural realm, that there are people that don't understand, you know, necessarily how to do these things safely.
[02:15:14.630 --> 02:15:22.251]  I mean, obviously, you go into far infrared heat, you go to excess, literally a body temperature issue could put you in a bad way, just like in a sweat lodge scenario.
[02:15:22.251 --> 02:15:26.972]  Yeah, if you feel yourself passing out, people, you know, don't continue.
[02:15:26.972 --> 02:15:30.973]  Get out of the infrared little closet there and drink some water.
[02:15:31.593 --> 02:15:38.760]  Yeah, it was kind of like the brilliant people that put frozen turkeys in peanut fryers.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:40.121]  Hey, what'd you think about that?
[02:15:40.121 --> 02:15:44.265]  Did you like the little firebombing demo that we've been warned about?
[02:15:44.265 --> 02:15:52.672]  Well, you know, it's sort of cheating ahead because that was one of the things I was going to tell you I was grateful for, that the TSA, the Turkey Security Administration,
[02:15:54.022 --> 02:16:00.804]  And the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security turkeys, basically, have warned us and saved us.
[02:16:00.804 --> 02:16:04.406]  I mean, how many millions of Americans are now safe because of their warning?
[02:16:04.406 --> 02:16:07.187]  I think it's the Department of Home Cooking Security now.
[02:16:07.187 --> 02:16:08.187]  Exactly.
[02:16:08.187 --> 02:16:11.008]  You know, we're talking about Taliban turkey terrorism now.
[02:16:11.008 --> 02:16:13.829]  What do you think about Vitamin C's See Something Say Something?
[02:16:15.696 --> 02:16:18.700]  That's our favorite nutrient now here at the InfoWars team.
[02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:22.825]  If you happen to see any vitamin C anywhere, you must say something.
[02:16:22.825 --> 02:16:24.087]  You must turn that in.
[02:16:24.087 --> 02:16:27.111]  It's a controlled substance, more dangerous than anything.
[02:16:27.111 --> 02:16:29.073]  Actually, no, Big Pharma is the real danger.
[02:16:29.574 --> 02:16:34.695]  And by the way, you know, I covered on the show just prior to coming on board here today.
[02:16:34.695 --> 02:16:39.017]  Of course, you did as well, I'm sure, the Ron Paul debate, so to speak.
[02:16:39.017 --> 02:16:43.338]  I mean, it was him and everybody else and sensational things when he acknowledged the failure of the war on drugs.
[02:16:43.338 --> 02:16:50.220]  And he acknowledged alone among that crew, as the doctor as well, the danger of the FDA prescription drugs being bought.
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:50.740]  He did!
[02:16:51.624 --> 02:16:52.145]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:52.145 --> 02:16:58.474]  He said more people are being killed by prescription drugs than in... Was he comparing it to the drug war deaths or terrorism deaths?
[02:16:58.474 --> 02:16:59.395]  I don't recall.
[02:16:59.395 --> 02:17:02.459]  Yeah, drug war to the illicit drugs as such.
[02:17:02.459 --> 02:17:06.545]  And, you know, we're not endorsing the use of synthetic street drugs either.
[02:17:08.087 --> 02:17:13.072]  The, you know, the botanicals of creation are certainly not what we need to be concerned with.
[02:17:13.072 --> 02:17:21.660]  We need to be concerned about the growth of government, which is, you know, an artificial creation, and our founding father certainly warned us against what we're living through right now.
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:26.085]  Well, if you think about the big threats that they're trying to scare us about, they're all imaginary.
[02:17:26.085 --> 02:17:29.228]  The whole war on terror, completely imaginary.
[02:17:29.228 --> 02:17:30.769]  Where are the terrorists?
[02:17:30.769 --> 02:17:30.969]  Where?
[02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:33.873]  Walker, I haven't seen any terrorists.
[02:17:33.873 --> 02:17:47.488]  Your odds of being killed by a terrorist, even if you buy the 9-11 story, your odds of being killed by a terrorist are far lower, literally tens of thousands of times lower than being killed by an FDA approved pharmaceutical.
[02:17:47.488 --> 02:17:49.149]  So where's the war on pharmaceuticals?
[02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:51.443]  Yeah, where is that war on that drugs?
[02:17:51.443 --> 02:17:56.790]  You know, which we might say it would be a legitimate one to declare and we could actually win and get it done with.
[02:17:56.790 --> 02:18:07.963]  I would say if we occupy the FDA, my good friend John Rappaport had indicated that that might be the next step here because they're looking at pulling two-thirds or more of the dietary supplements off the market with these new guidelines.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:14.105]  I think it'd be great if the people baking the laws in Washington would simply occupy their own minds.
[02:18:14.105 --> 02:18:19.330]  Because they're way off-world occupying something way out there.
[02:18:19.330 --> 02:18:21.131]  And Robert, we're going to take calls, by the way.
[02:18:21.131 --> 02:18:24.755]  We've got a couple people on, not in this segment, but in the following segment.
[02:18:24.755 --> 02:18:25.856]  But let's get to our list.
[02:18:25.856 --> 02:18:28.098]  We've got some things to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.
[02:18:28.098 --> 02:18:32.222]  I know you brought five things, I brought five things, and then maybe the callers have some things.
[02:18:32.222 --> 02:18:33.423]  What do you want to start off with?
[02:18:33.973 --> 02:18:36.676]  Well, yeah, some are serious, some are funny, obviously.
[02:18:36.676 --> 02:18:41.281]  As I mentioned, the TSA's announcement about the turkey fryers, which I'm so grateful for that.
[02:18:41.281 --> 02:18:43.103]  But it is an absurdist notion.
[02:18:43.103 --> 02:18:45.025]  When they do that, it wakes more people up.
[02:18:45.025 --> 02:18:48.089]  So I am genuinely grateful for their absurdity and stupidity.
[02:18:49.335 --> 02:19:11.390]  You know, I think one of the things we have to, and we'll probably both agree on this, that we're very grateful for, and have been for a long time, is Congressman Dr. Ron Paul, as a human, much less as a congressman and all the things that he's doing, to wake up the sleeping population here in America, and perhaps around the world, because of the growth of the message via the internet and through InfoWars, Alex Jones, and the great work he's doing as well.
[02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:18.778]  And I'm truly grateful because he's been a catalyst to bring awareness in ways very few have been able to get this kind of information out.
[02:19:18.778 --> 02:19:23.884]  And although it's taken many decades, the fact is it's having a major impact now.
[02:19:23.884 --> 02:19:33.034]  We're seeing him climb to the top of the charts in Iowa, and his tenacity, his continued steadfastness, and unwillingness to give up or change the message.
[02:19:33.134 --> 02:19:34.915]  Well, Robert, you are pirating my list.
[02:19:34.915 --> 02:19:40.439]  He was number one on my list of things to be thankful for, too, so I guess I gotta come up with more.
[02:19:40.439 --> 02:19:41.760]  And your calls are coming up.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:50.126]  Richard, Frank, Janice, Judy, and John will get to your calls and more things to be thankful for right here on the Alex Jones Show on this day before Thanksgiving.
[02:19:50.126 --> 02:19:50.707]  Stay with us.
[02:19:50.707 --> 02:19:52.989]  We'll be right back in a few minutes.
[02:19:52.989 --> 02:19:53.349]  Yeah!

[02:22:01.249 --> 02:22:07.094]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[02:22:07.094 --> 02:22:10.297]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.
[02:22:10.297 --> 02:22:21.606]  We promote premium quality health, energy, and skincare products using dynamic, caring personalities and state-of-the-art media technology to spread a powerful message of health.
[02:22:21.946 --> 02:22:22.927]  We're good to go.
[02:22:51.866 --> 02:22:54.331]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[02:22:54.331 --> 02:22:58.117]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[02:22:58.117 --> 02:23:00.602]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[02:23:02.159 --> 02:23:05.542]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:23:05.542 --> 02:23:08.684]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[02:23:08.684 --> 02:23:24.015]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:23:24.015 --> 02:23:24.975]  In all at least 68 diseases,
[02:23:25.916 --> 02:23:30.500]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production?
[02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:33.963]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:33.963 --> 02:23:37.586]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein.
[02:23:37.586 --> 02:23:41.270]  All other whey protein powders are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[02:23:41.730 --> 02:23:42.190]  We're good.
[02:24:23.802 --> 02:24:25.043]  That's pretty dramatic.
[02:24:25.043 --> 02:24:27.805]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:27.805 --> 02:24:29.467]  I'm filling in today.
[02:24:29.467 --> 02:24:34.131]  For Alex, I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger, editor of naturalnews.com, and we are on to enlist
[02:24:35.310 --> 02:24:44.715]  Of the top things that we are thankful for on this Thanksgiving, your calls are coming up, and we've got Robert Scott Bell joining us by Skype, and I am powered by chocolate superfood smoothie.
[02:24:44.715 --> 02:24:48.458]  Here it is, in a canning jar.
[02:24:48.458 --> 02:24:50.679]  That's what I bring here every time.
[02:24:50.679 --> 02:24:54.661]  No, this is not a substance-enhanced performance unless you consider cacao.
[02:24:54.661 --> 02:24:59.084]  That's cocoa, for those of you... It's cacao from South America.
[02:24:59.084 --> 02:25:02.266]  That is the only substance that I take before I do my shows here.
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.642]  Just good nutrition, good alkaloids in there.
[02:25:05.642 --> 02:25:11.686]  Helps protect brain function and neurological function and just makes you feel good about being alive.
[02:25:11.686 --> 02:25:12.527]  What do you say, Robert?
[02:25:12.527 --> 02:25:14.448]  You happy to be alive today?
[02:25:14.448 --> 02:25:15.869]  Oh yeah, I'm grateful, absolutely.
[02:25:15.869 --> 02:25:20.892]  I was buzzing on Kakao the other day when I was interviewing the old Governor Jesse Ventura on the air.
[02:25:20.892 --> 02:25:23.454]  That was a great interview.
[02:25:23.454 --> 02:25:27.537]  He really unloaded and just did not censor himself at all.
[02:25:27.537 --> 02:25:29.819]  He had a story about Fox News and all kinds of stuff.
[02:25:30.330 --> 02:25:31.410]  Yeah, he had a blast.
[02:25:31.410 --> 02:25:32.391]  He really enjoyed it.
[02:25:32.391 --> 02:25:39.954]  I think, you know, that leads me to my second level of gratitude, and not that we're going to say one's more than another, but the second one here for me is the new media.
[02:25:39.954 --> 02:25:55.220]  And that includes you, Mike, it includes Alex Jones, Natural News, etc., and all of the people out there that have become the media through social networks, through blog sites, through everything, because it is really part of the next revolution, the awakening, if you will, and, you know, the things that Jesse Ventura is doing.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:01.483]  He was so giddy because, you know, we actually get to discuss things and not do sound bites.
[02:26:01.483 --> 02:26:05.404]  Talk, go in depth on issues that, you know, I think there's a hunger for that.
[02:26:05.404 --> 02:26:06.885]  That's why the new media is growing.
[02:26:06.885 --> 02:26:10.607]  That's why Alex is growing so much, you know, despite a bad economy out there.
[02:26:10.607 --> 02:26:19.350]  The thing is the hunger for this information and, you know, there are a few people out there like yourself and Alex that are providing it and we're doing our level best to get this information out there.
[02:26:19.350 --> 02:26:24.793]  So I'm very grateful that we're all doing this and that includes all the people that think they're just listeners.
[02:26:24.793 --> 02:26:25.313]  They're more than that.
[02:26:25.553 --> 02:26:29.916]  They're taking this information, they're doing things with it that are extraordinary.
[02:26:29.916 --> 02:26:30.697]  They are, absolutely.
[02:26:30.697 --> 02:26:35.460]  The new media is going to be the future media because the old media is the dead media.
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:36.281]  They're irrelevant!
[02:26:37.369 --> 02:26:53.400]  When people wake up, as they are doing now, they realize that the old media is just lying to them, or distracting them, or refusing to report the stories that they should be hearing about, like all the heavy metals in your copper pipes, in your lead pipes, in your food, in your children's toys, for example.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:55.061]  Where's the reporting on that story?
[02:26:55.061 --> 02:26:57.323]  You won't see that in the mainstream media, typically.
[02:26:57.323 --> 02:26:58.804]  You'll only get it in places like this.
[02:26:59.366 --> 02:27:05.288]  Yeah, and much less the willingness to discuss natural options that are not approved of by the government.
[02:27:05.288 --> 02:27:13.731]  You know, that we would ever think that the government would have, you know, the ability to arbitrate and make a decision about what we put into our bodies or how we take things out of our bodies.
[02:27:13.731 --> 02:27:15.972]  I mean, it's a sorry state that we are in.
[02:27:15.972 --> 02:27:18.933]  I mean, these are the things I'm not really grateful for.
[02:27:18.933 --> 02:27:26.796]  But I acknowledge in my own life, Mike, and you know my story, having suffered through 24 years of chronic illness brought about by government medicine, monopoly medicine,
[02:27:27.496 --> 02:27:36.006]  If I had not suffered the way I did, I would not know a fraction of the things I know today to be able to communicate regularly through and being a part of the new media.
[02:27:36.006 --> 02:27:37.788]  So, suffering is not all bad.
[02:27:37.788 --> 02:27:39.109]  I don't wish it upon anybody.
[02:27:39.109 --> 02:27:42.413]  But at the same time, I learned a great deal because of the suffering I went through.
[02:27:43.035 --> 02:27:43.735]  Yeah, me too.
[02:27:43.735 --> 02:27:51.759]  I used to be borderline obese, diabetic, chronic pain, extremely difficult mental state.
[02:27:51.759 --> 02:27:56.722]  I went through a lot, and yeah, I got healed just like you got healed, and I'm thankful for that as well.
[02:27:56.722 --> 02:27:58.783]  Let me get to the second one on my list.
[02:27:58.783 --> 02:27:58.923]  Sure.
[02:27:58.923 --> 02:28:05.086]  This is an unusual choice, perhaps, and people might not be expecting this, and I do want to take your calls later on here shortly.
[02:28:05.686 --> 02:28:08.187]  But I want to thank my wife.
[02:28:08.187 --> 02:28:22.836]  I want to thank my wife and all the wives out there who, your wife Robert, and Alex's wife, and Jesse Ventura's wife, and all the wives out there who understand the importance of what we do and support us in our efforts to be on the front lines.
[02:28:23.656 --> 02:28:28.180]  And to tell the truth, sometimes even at risk to our own safety.
[02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:28.860]  Yeah.
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:35.505]  Because we cannot do what we do without the support of the women in our households and the women in our communities.
[02:28:35.505 --> 02:28:49.475]  And I want to give a big shout out to all the women out there who are also patriots, who also support freedom, who support your husband's fights for freedom and for the future generations of America.
[02:28:49.475 --> 02:28:52.297]  Yeah, I will obviously second that or else I'll be in big trouble.
[02:28:53.770 --> 02:28:56.652]  I set you up for that, Robert.
[02:28:56.652 --> 02:28:58.153]  Honestly, it is that.
[02:28:58.153 --> 02:29:04.297]  They realize what we're doing and they stand behind us and give us strength and sustenance in so many ways.
[02:29:04.297 --> 02:29:06.499]  I'll bless and love them dearly.
[02:29:06.499 --> 02:29:14.024]  Carol Paul, who I met, Ron Paul's wife of 50 years or so now, amazing woman standing beside her husband.
[02:29:14.024 --> 02:29:16.726]  Literally, he's putting his life at risk by doing what he is doing.
[02:29:16.726 --> 02:29:18.167]  The more he gains traction,
[02:29:19.008 --> 02:29:23.513]  So, yes, a debt of gratitude that we owe to those women.
[02:29:23.513 --> 02:29:30.861]  And, you know, if I add something along that vein, I think one of the things more recently that I'm very grateful for are the Raw Milk Freedom Riders.
[02:29:30.861 --> 02:29:32.523]  These are also in the Mom White.
[02:29:32.523 --> 02:29:33.124]  Great moms!
[02:29:34.125 --> 02:29:35.446]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:35.446 --> 02:29:36.547]  We're getting ready to go to break, Robert.
[02:29:36.547 --> 02:29:37.748]  Sorry to cut you off.
[02:29:37.748 --> 02:29:42.672]  But we will be right back in a few minutes with more things to be thankful for, including taking your calls.
[02:29:42.672 --> 02:29:44.753]  I promise we'll get it working after this break.
[02:29:44.753 --> 02:29:47.315]  Stay with us right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:47.315 --> 02:29:50.358]  This is Mike Adams and we'll be right back.
[02:29:50.358 --> 02:29:51.759]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.759 --> 02:29:54.281]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.281 --> 02:29:56.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.259 --> 02:30:06.941]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:30:06.941 --> 02:30:12.824]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:30:12.824 --> 02:30:15.646]  Number one, study the past.
[02:30:15.646 --> 02:30:18.047]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:30:18.047 --> 02:30:21.769]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:30:22.904 --> 02:30:25.986]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:30:25.986 --> 02:30:29.829]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:30:29.829 --> 02:30:34.873]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:30:34.873 --> 02:30:38.875]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:30:38.875 --> 02:30:42.298]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:30:42.298 --> 02:30:45.940]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:46.781 --> 02:30:51.705]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:30:51.705 --> 02:30:56.328]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:56.328 --> 02:31:01.411]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:01.411 --> 02:31:15.842]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:21.562]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:21.562 --> 02:31:34.329]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.329 --> 02:31:41.593]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:42.273 --> 02:31:52.659]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:52.659 --> 02:31:56.581]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:56.581 --> 02:31:59.683]  That's www.SilverLungs.com

[02:33:17.051 --> 02:33:19.873]  Don't want no shackles on me!
[02:33:19.873 --> 02:33:21.835]  Don't want no shackles on me!
[02:33:21.835 --> 02:33:22.796]  Don't want no shackles on me!
[02:33:33.905 --> 02:33:48.140]  For being a listener and a supporter of InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Show and all the great heroes and patriots out there who quite literally sacrifice their time, time with families often, to bring you this information.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:55.767]  And thank you all of you out there for playing your part and sharing the information and doing the tweets and doing the Facebook posts.
[02:33:56.529 --> 02:34:06.170]  And linking to the stories on InfoWars and donating money during the recent money bomb and everything that you do to keep this operation running and just kicking it out there.
[02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.631]  We are, we are...
[02:34:08.004 --> 02:34:13.288]  Yeah, we're hitting it hard because it is no time.
[02:34:13.288 --> 02:34:14.389]  No time to rest.
[02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:16.071]  Tyranny is upon us.
[02:34:16.071 --> 02:34:22.736]  Freedom is within our reach, but only if we stand up right now and do what is necessary to protect it and restore it.
[02:34:22.736 --> 02:34:25.118]  And we are joined right now by Robert Scott Bell.
[02:34:25.118 --> 02:34:26.740]  We've also got callers waiting on the line.
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:28.882]  And Robert, would you be okay?
[02:34:28.882 --> 02:34:30.063]  How about we take a call right now?
[02:34:30.822 --> 02:34:31.903]  Sure, yeah, absolutely.
[02:34:31.903 --> 02:34:32.123]  Love it.
[02:34:32.123 --> 02:34:34.485]  All right, let's go to Richard in Washington.
[02:34:34.485 --> 02:34:37.848]  Richard, you're on the air with Mike Adams and Robert Scott Bell.
[02:34:37.848 --> 02:34:39.089]  How you doing?
[02:34:39.089 --> 02:34:39.630]  Real good.
[02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:41.071]  Great show.
[02:34:41.071 --> 02:34:42.492]  You guys kind of touched on the thing.
[02:34:42.492 --> 02:34:55.603]  I find it highly ironic that an MD, an allopathic practitioner, who both doctors and dentists plug the body full of toxicity, is worried about the environmental sources of this toxicity.
[02:34:55.603 --> 02:34:58.526]  You know, I find that really totally ironic.
[02:34:59.164 --> 02:35:13.313]  But the point I majorly wanted to make was, and Robert can touch on this also, the energetic aspect is, if you study our anthropology, when we were hunter-gatherers, we didn't cook our proteins and fats above body temperature.
[02:35:13.313 --> 02:35:23.040]  You know, we may have put them over an open fire or whatever, but essentially our proteins and fats were in a raw form, and putting, each of us has a choice, putting cooked
[02:35:23.482 --> 02:35:28.984]  Proteins and fats into our system is what causes our health situation.
[02:35:28.984 --> 02:35:32.566]  You can study the Kellogg Report or the works of Price or Pottinger.
[02:35:32.566 --> 02:35:43.851]  No organism in the world cooks their food other than the humans and which is the sickest species on the world.
[02:35:43.991 --> 02:36:10.165]  Yeah, I've heard talk, you know, a lot of people talking about that, and I appreciate your comments, and it is, first about, you mentioned about the doctor we had on earlier, yeah, it's interesting, but we've got to give credit to those MDs who do veer off the path of just poisoning people, and who start to look at the causes of disease and work on preventing it, and, you know, that doctor, Dr. Lonky, is willing to put his book out there, Invisible Killers, a book that is not going to be well-liked by the cancer industry.
[02:36:11.165 --> 02:36:12.386]  But, you know, good point on that.
[02:36:12.386 --> 02:36:15.408]  Now, tell us more about the raw meat thing.
[02:36:15.408 --> 02:36:19.811]  So, you don't think we should cook our turkeys like firebombs in vats of oil?
[02:36:19.811 --> 02:36:21.452]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:36:21.452 --> 02:36:22.273]  No, no.
[02:36:22.273 --> 02:36:25.495]  What everybody's worried about is bacteria, moles, and funguses.
[02:36:25.495 --> 02:36:32.740]  But if you actually are in the parasympathetic state and you secrete hydrochloric acid, that's nothing more than food.
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:35.602]  It's only because we eat so many carbohydrates and have destroyed
[02:36:36.235 --> 02:36:44.959]  The parasympathetic state and our secretion of hydrochloric acid that we are no longer able to digest the raw proteins and fats and utilize those for food.
[02:36:44.959 --> 02:37:00.927]  There's a whole modern perspective that is challenging our system and instead of addressing what we should be doing naturally in our eating habits, we essentially deal with the unnatural situation we've developed and claim that's the problem.
[02:37:00.927 --> 02:37:05.309]  All you have to do is look at the physiology and you can find out that we're being miseducated.
[02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.277]  Very good points, Richard.
[02:37:07.277 --> 02:37:08.778]  Robert, what's your take on that?
[02:37:08.778 --> 02:37:16.365]  I mean, personally, I'm not going to eat raw meat, but I do eat mostly, really, I don't know, 50% raw diet, let's say, but it's plants, not meat.
[02:37:16.365 --> 02:37:17.786]  What's your take on it, Robert?
[02:37:17.786 --> 02:37:24.892]  It is fascinating, and the caller does bring up a good point, and that is that we have such gastrointestinal insufficiencies,
[02:37:25.452 --> 02:37:30.915]  We've got a ways to go back to where we have the strength or what I call the scenic condition.
[02:37:53.649 --> 02:38:06.958]  You know, as we talk as a homeopath here, to be able to withstand and interact with the microbial world without, you know, it's like the Superman concept of being able to walk through walls of microbes and basically be untouched by it because we are so strong and healthy.
[02:38:06.958 --> 02:38:10.200]  Very few people now in the West have that level of strength.
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:12.862]  You know, funny, I was mentioning the raw milk freedom ride.
[02:38:12.862 --> 02:38:16.424]  I was there, Max Kane, who you know, we talked about, is a big proponent.
[02:38:16.424 --> 02:38:18.766]  They're wanting to do another one from Wisconsin to Chicago.
[02:38:19.386 --> 02:38:27.214]  And he literally had, you know, basically a bunch of ground, I don't know if it was beef, buffalo, or sheep, and he was eating it raw.
[02:38:27.214 --> 02:38:27.795]  I witnessed this.
[02:38:29.392 --> 02:38:30.773]  At no problem.
[02:38:30.773 --> 02:38:32.193]  He was not contaminated.
[02:38:32.193 --> 02:38:41.797]  He didn't fall dead of an infection, a sepsis or whatever, but he had worked his way back into that level of strength and vitality to be able to eat raw as we did once in the wild.
[02:38:41.797 --> 02:38:45.779]  But to do so as a typical American now could be very dangerous and deadly.
[02:38:45.779 --> 02:38:46.019]  Alright.
[02:38:46.019 --> 02:38:47.660]  We'll work our way back into that.
[02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:50.621]  Yeah, I am not doing the raw meat thing, folks.
[02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:54.263]  I'm gonna cook it even if I have to set the turkey on fire.
[02:38:55.403 --> 02:38:59.987]  But I'm gonna have a free-range turkey, some free-range turkey meat this holiday season.
[02:38:59.987 --> 02:39:01.268]  But good points on both sides.
[02:39:01.268 --> 02:39:02.329]  Thanks for your call, Richard.
[02:39:02.329 --> 02:39:03.390]  Much appreciated.
[02:39:03.390 --> 02:39:05.612]  Let's go to Ralph in Texas.
[02:39:05.612 --> 02:39:08.434]  Ralph, you're on the air with Mike Adams and Robert Scott Bell.
[02:39:08.434 --> 02:39:08.815]  How you doing?
[02:39:08.815 --> 02:39:11.357]  Hey, I'm doing great.
[02:39:11.357 --> 02:39:12.118]  Yeah, how can we help you?
[02:39:12.118 --> 02:39:12.638]  What's on your mind?
[02:39:12.638 --> 02:39:13.699]  Hi.
[02:39:13.699 --> 02:39:21.726]  I just read a report with some statistics saying that one in five Americans are on anti-psychotic drugs.
[02:39:22.062 --> 02:39:26.683]  Yeah, one in four women, and one in five overall.
[02:39:26.683 --> 02:39:38.286]  And I find this concerning, but I wanted to get your take on the role the pharmaceutical industry is playing in this New World Order plan, and yeah.
[02:39:40.765 --> 02:39:46.832]  Well, I think if you suffer from concern, that is a psychiatric condition requiring pharmaceutical treatment.
[02:39:46.832 --> 02:39:47.593]  Isn't that right, Robert?
[02:39:47.593 --> 02:39:49.355]  This caller needs some treatment.
[02:39:49.355 --> 02:39:50.396]  We should send him to a pharmacy.
[02:39:50.396 --> 02:39:55.361]  Put some through the phone lines for him immediately, because we can't have him raising such questions.
[02:39:55.361 --> 02:39:58.344]  I mean, in fact, the answer to the question is it's essential.
[02:39:58.344 --> 02:40:01.908]  Without the pharmaceutical industrial complex, the New World Order is not possible.
[02:40:02.549 --> 02:40:19.102]  Because their ability to dampen the consciousness, weaken the will, is essential for the takeover, for the people to be sheeple, as many of the Americans have become, and old people around the world, in Europe, and we've seen it recently as well, with the attack on supplements and other things, now that water can't hydrate you in Europe.
[02:40:21.741 --> 02:40:23.682]  As a species, if this is the case.
[02:40:23.682 --> 02:40:25.683]  Oh yeah, I forgot to even cover the water story.
[02:40:25.683 --> 02:40:29.424]  What about the woman who had her buttocks injected with fix-a-flat tire inflator?
[02:40:29.424 --> 02:40:30.645]  That's a good one, too.
[02:40:30.645 --> 02:40:41.189]  But more to your point, Collar, look, don't forget that the psychiatric industry has defined another disease as oppositional defiance disorder, ODD.
[02:40:41.189 --> 02:40:44.130]  So if you disagree with the globalist agenda, you now have a disease.
[02:40:44.130 --> 02:40:45.051]  What do you think about that?
[02:40:45.051 --> 02:40:47.052]  I think you might be diagnosed with that.
[02:40:47.052 --> 02:40:47.772]  What's your take, Ralph?
[02:40:49.525 --> 02:40:59.127]  Well, I think there's a concerted effort to really ruin the psyche of all Americans and to whose benefit.
[02:40:59.127 --> 02:41:03.988]  I think there's a lack of awareness, but you guys are doing a great job.
[02:41:03.988 --> 02:41:08.810]  Maybe you guys could recommend some books on holistic health.
[02:41:11.283 --> 02:41:12.244]  Sure, yeah.
[02:41:12.244 --> 02:41:15.085]  Well, I like Elson Haas as an author.
[02:41:15.085 --> 02:41:16.586]  He's got some great books out there.
[02:41:16.586 --> 02:41:18.287]  H-A-A-S.
[02:41:18.287 --> 02:41:22.049]  You could also study the DSM-IV, the Psychiatric Bible.
[02:41:22.049 --> 02:41:24.750]  That would give you more... I say that in jest.
[02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:26.451]  Robert, what do you recommend as a good overall book?
[02:41:27.111 --> 02:41:28.312]  That's a horrific read.
[02:41:28.312 --> 02:41:48.531]  I think from a wake-up call perspective, I always come back to our good friend Dr. Carolyn Dean and her books, particularly the one Death by Modern Medicine, because when you realize the holocaust that is in place due to FDA sanction, government sanction, licensed and monopolized drugs, that's a big step to say, alright, instead of reaching for the medicine cabinet, instead of going to the doctor,
[02:41:49.311 --> 02:41:51.892]  Including the pediatricians, the children's doctors.
[02:41:51.892 --> 02:41:52.992]  You know, it's a horrific thing.
[02:41:52.992 --> 02:41:58.874]  You know, if you think about it, these doctors, all they do are drug and inject children.
[02:41:58.874 --> 02:42:06.197]  I mean, it should be... I'm not into banning professions, but the way they behave, I would almost say we could get rid of pediatricians and we'd have much healthier children at this point.
[02:42:06.497 --> 02:42:08.098]  Oh yeah, that's totally true.
[02:42:08.098 --> 02:42:11.480]  Yeah, the last thing you want to do is take your child to a conventional pediatrician.
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:20.326]  Because if they diagnose your child with cancer, which a lot of times is a false positive, and if you don't subject your child to that chemotherapy, they will have you arrested!
[02:42:20.326 --> 02:42:22.728]  And your child taken away by CPS.
[02:42:22.728 --> 02:42:24.509]  We've reported on it multiple times!
[02:42:25.031 --> 02:42:25.971]  That's right.
[02:42:25.971 --> 02:42:26.631]  Okay.
[02:42:26.631 --> 02:42:27.772]  Thank you, caller, for your call.
[02:42:27.772 --> 02:42:28.572]  Very, very good points.
[02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:31.172]  Robert, let's get the third item on your list.
[02:42:31.172 --> 02:42:33.192]  Otherwise, we're never going to finish our list here today.
[02:42:33.192 --> 02:42:33.913]  What do you got?
[02:42:33.913 --> 02:42:34.953]  Number three.
[02:42:34.953 --> 02:42:36.993]  Well, I mentioned the Rommel Freedom Riders.
[02:42:36.993 --> 02:42:48.595]  I just want to say, you know, the farmers and the fellow healers out there that are standing basically up for their right to bring the healing that's necessary, even though it's not approved by government.
[02:42:48.595 --> 02:42:51.576]  Those that are basically saying, here I am, come and get me.
[02:42:53.036 --> 02:42:57.398]  Encouraging people to go get arrested, but at the same point in time, they can't arrest everybody.
[02:42:57.398 --> 02:43:17.749]  So I'm still waiting to where I can say I'm grateful for the dietary supplement industry, because until they stand up, all of them en masse together, and say, here we are, we're doing what is right, we are not harming anybody, you have no authority to come and make us do the things you're trying to make us do to destroy our industry and the good products that we're providing.
[02:43:17.749 --> 02:43:20.751]  Having said that, the farmers out there that are going to be teaching
[02:43:21.571 --> 02:43:26.016]  All of us that have not been in that farm community to grow our own food again.
[02:43:26.016 --> 02:43:27.799]  I mean, that's the gratitude coming out.
[02:43:27.799 --> 02:43:37.931]  That's the thanksgiving I have and I have the message for them to please be vocal, outspoken, stand up and begin to offer your skills to others because we desperately need that out there.
[02:43:38.590 --> 02:43:39.610]  Well said, Robert.
[02:43:39.610 --> 02:43:41.111]  You must be reading my mind yet again.
[02:43:41.111 --> 02:43:42.431]  I have a related item.
[02:43:42.431 --> 02:43:48.393]  The third item on my list to be thankful for this Thanksgiving Day is none other than dirt.
[02:43:48.393 --> 02:43:54.096]  Yes, dirt and soil, without which we would have no civilization on our planet.
[02:43:54.096 --> 02:43:57.317]  Soils are eroding and disappearing at a record pace.
[02:43:57.317 --> 02:43:59.117]  The food supply is going to be threatened.
[02:43:59.117 --> 02:44:03.379]  And I am currently on a ranch near Austin that has dirt.
[02:44:03.379 --> 02:44:06.200]  In fact, before coming on the show today, I was on a John Deere tractor.
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:10.967]  And sometimes after the show, people say, hey Mike, how do you make your skin look so good on camera?
[02:44:10.967 --> 02:44:12.549]  Do you have a makeup artist?
[02:44:12.549 --> 02:44:17.277]  No, it's a thin layer of grime and clay from the dirt on the ranch.
[02:44:17.277 --> 02:44:18.499]  Makeup by John Deere.
[02:44:18.499 --> 02:44:19.581]  That's what I got going on here.
[02:44:20.253 --> 02:44:25.436]  But, truly, without D.I.R.T., we wouldn't have anything in our... And where does D.I.R.T.
[02:44:25.436 --> 02:44:26.337]  come from?
[02:44:26.337 --> 02:44:26.737]  Where does D.I.R.T.
[02:44:26.737 --> 02:44:27.298]  come from?
[02:44:27.298 --> 02:44:29.179]  Ultimately, we've got to thank the Creator.
[02:44:29.179 --> 02:44:30.620]  We've got to thank Mother Nature.
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:31.380]  We've got to thank God.
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:32.981]  We've got to thank the higher powers as well.
[02:44:32.981 --> 02:44:36.263]  But I know our list is focused on more of the mundane things.
[02:44:36.263 --> 02:44:38.385]  Robert, you okay if we take another call?
[02:44:38.385 --> 02:44:39.005]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:39.005 --> 02:44:40.326]  Having a good time with you, as always.
[02:44:40.326 --> 02:44:44.008]  Alright, Janice from Texas, thank you for holding and you are on the air.
[02:44:44.008 --> 02:44:44.589]  Go ahead, please.
[02:44:45.805 --> 02:44:46.245]  Hi, Mike.
[02:44:46.245 --> 02:44:47.907]  Hi, Robert.
[02:44:47.907 --> 02:44:48.968]  Things to be thankful for.
[02:44:48.968 --> 02:44:57.014]  I'm thankful for guys like you who teach self-empowerment and not dependence, a big pharma.
[02:44:57.014 --> 02:45:00.677]  I mean, because that's all they do is teach dependence.
[02:45:00.677 --> 02:45:05.441]  But I'm calling about another issue, and I tried to call you another time about it.
[02:45:05.441 --> 02:45:08.303]  It ties into the farm tractor regulations.
[02:45:08.303 --> 02:45:09.064]  Yeah.
[02:45:11.135 --> 02:45:38.952]  I just wanted to concur with Alex and Jesse Ventura when they keep saying this is like the East German Stasi model and I will say I have seen that up close and personal and I'll make this quick in 1982 I took a 21 years old by myself took a night train from London to Berlin to West Berlin to do a show I had missed the flight whatever so I had to go by train and as soon as we crossed over into East Berlin to get to West Berlin
[02:45:39.989 --> 02:45:47.075]  I was not, you know, in the carriage by myself, and two armed Stasi officers come in and demand my ticket.
[02:45:47.075 --> 02:45:47.976]  And I said, who are you?
[02:45:47.976 --> 02:45:49.457]  Where's the train conductor?
[02:45:49.457 --> 02:45:56.463]  And they got mad and started yelling, and I handed them my ticket, and they wanted my passport, and I said, I've already been cleared through German Customs or whatever.
[02:45:56.463 --> 02:46:00.347]  They grabbed my passport, they saw it was an American passport, and went crazy.
[02:46:00.347 --> 02:46:00.567]  Wow.
[02:46:00.567 --> 02:46:02.689]  Just crazy yelling at me, and they went and got
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:05.062]  Maybe you have illegal wood in your guitar!
[02:46:18.913 --> 02:46:20.514]  Even this is pre-1982.
[02:46:20.514 --> 02:46:24.816]  Would I ever think that I would see that in my country?
[02:46:24.816 --> 02:46:25.696]  No.
[02:46:25.696 --> 02:46:29.598]  But anyway, I said, look, I'm just, you know, the Beatles play Hamburg.
[02:46:29.598 --> 02:46:33.120]  That's, you know, the German love of rock and roll, whatever.
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:39.323]  Well, that was the wrong thing to say, because the one who spoke English drew on me and said, stand up.
[02:46:39.323 --> 02:46:41.444]  I could feel the gun metal.
[02:46:41.444 --> 02:46:43.205]  Drew his firearm on you?
[02:46:43.205 --> 02:46:43.785]  Yeah.
[02:46:43.785 --> 02:46:44.105]  Wow.
[02:46:44.105 --> 02:46:45.646]  And my head, point blank range.
[02:46:45.646 --> 02:46:47.387]  I mean, I could feel the barrel of the rifle.
[02:46:48.098 --> 02:46:53.540]  And he marched me down to the livestock carriage, which also had people.
[02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:55.720]  Well, my point about that is that I would like to just
[02:47:05.766 --> 02:47:06.226]  All right.
[02:47:06.226 --> 02:47:06.687]  Yeah.
[02:47:25.031 --> 02:47:30.053]  Thank you, Janice, for your call, but look, we do not espouse violence here as a way to resolve these issues.
[02:47:30.053 --> 02:47:39.998]  I sense your anger, Janice, in your description there, the fear, the terror that they tried to instill in you at that moment, and we just gotta be real careful.
[02:47:39.998 --> 02:47:40.258]  We do not...
[02:47:42.399 --> 02:47:44.442]  Shooting back is not the way for us to solve this.
[02:47:44.442 --> 02:47:46.224]  It's not the revolution that we want.
[02:47:46.224 --> 02:47:47.566]  We want a peaceful revolution.
[02:47:47.566 --> 02:47:49.829]  We want the Ron Paul revolution.
[02:47:49.829 --> 02:47:51.552]  What do you say, Robert, to that?
[02:47:51.552 --> 02:47:57.740]  Well, you know, Janice's story is very profound, and I hear this from those that have immigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe.
[02:47:57.740 --> 02:47:59.622]  We have a lot of listeners that have, and they
[02:48:00.423 --> 02:48:05.487]  When I talk to them about what's happened here in America, and they're just so sad, and sometimes they're angry, but more often they're sad.
[02:48:05.487 --> 02:48:06.428]  They just don't understand.
[02:48:06.428 --> 02:48:07.969]  It's like, what happened, you Americans?
[02:48:07.969 --> 02:48:15.195]  You were the land of liberty, you loved liberty, and now you're going the way of where we came from, why we wanted to come to America.
[02:48:15.195 --> 02:48:26.845]  And so I am grateful for those immigrants because oftentimes we have basically been so indoctrinated over generations now that we can't see what has happened in the context of the boiling of the frog slowly enough that we don't jump out.
[02:48:27.345 --> 02:48:34.516]  So, to have those warning signs, it's hard for people with experience like Janice to actually say, hey, that does not make you safe.
[02:48:34.516 --> 02:48:38.241]  Of course, you know, these are the things where we talked earlier about the suffering.
[02:48:38.241 --> 02:48:43.028]  Does America need to suffer a total economic collapse in order for us to embrace liberty again?
[02:48:43.608 --> 02:48:48.312]  Instead of totalitarianism and dictatorship and tyranny.
[02:48:48.312 --> 02:48:49.913]  Sometimes it takes that brutality.
[02:48:49.913 --> 02:48:55.058]  People with cancer or AIDS are very serious issues before they come to someone like me as a homeopath.
[02:48:55.058 --> 02:48:58.821]  They'll often have gone through so much before they're willing to change their diet or lifestyle.
[02:48:58.821 --> 02:49:02.404]  Some of them will choose to die rather than change and that's part of the equation.
[02:49:02.404 --> 02:49:03.745]  We'll find out who's ready.
[02:49:03.905 --> 02:49:04.746]  But that's what's interesting.
[02:49:04.746 --> 02:49:18.176]  It's also true about nations, just as people have to suffer through a health crisis before they awaken to the reality that they gotta take care of their bodies, and they gotta follow rules, you know, and protect their rights, the safety of their own internal organs.
[02:49:18.176 --> 02:49:19.637]  Nations do the same thing, don't they?
[02:49:19.637 --> 02:49:26.822]  Where nations sometimes they become complacent and apathetic, and then they lose their freedoms, and then the tyranny comes in, and then they awaken and realize,
[02:49:27.483 --> 02:49:33.625]  Oh my goodness, maybe we should not have let go of that Fourth Amendment right or that First or Second Amendment right.
[02:49:33.625 --> 02:49:39.588]  It seems like America is in that patient crisis, to use the medical metaphor, right now.
[02:49:40.290 --> 02:49:53.162]  Yeah, and that was the brilliance of Ron Paul in a debate yesterday where he said, don't be so callously unwilling to give up like Newt Gingrich is to say, we want a camera and a cop in every house so we can prevent wife beating or whatever.
[02:49:53.162 --> 02:49:55.304]  Oh yeah, we don't want another Timothy McVeigh.
[02:49:55.304 --> 02:49:56.085]  Who does?
[02:49:56.085 --> 02:50:02.551]  But at the same point, do you sacrifice everything that we fought the revolution for in America to say that we can be safe?
[02:50:02.551 --> 02:50:04.633]  I mean, this is where Gingrich is amazing tonight.
[02:50:04.713 --> 02:50:04.913]  I don't
[02:50:25.598 --> 02:50:39.729]  Just knowing how to survive in the world and knowing basic fundamental laws and basic rights, that's where it seems like Newt Gingrich just falls flat on his face, which is very, very disturbing to see that he could be so intelligent and yet he has no wisdom.
[02:50:41.638 --> 02:50:44.641]  All right, well, Robert Scott is still with us there, sorry.
[02:50:44.641 --> 02:50:46.383]  We will be right back after this break.
[02:50:46.383 --> 02:50:47.864]  We're going to take another call.
[02:50:47.864 --> 02:50:52.229]  We're going to continue with our list of things to be thankful for on this Thanksgiving, so stay with us.
[02:50:52.229 --> 02:50:54.551]  A lot more ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:54.551 --> 02:50:55.212]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.300 --> 02:51:03.562]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:51:03.562 --> 02:51:07.165]  An easy, natural, organic way to bring relief to diabetics.
[02:51:07.165 --> 02:51:09.147]  Introducing MDS Forte.
[02:51:09.147 --> 02:51:13.150]  A concentrated super strength extract formulated for those who are looking for relief.
[02:51:13.150 --> 02:51:15.212]  What can MDS Forte do for you?
[02:51:15.212 --> 02:51:18.114]  MDS Forte reduces glucose levels safely and effectively.
[02:51:18.294 --> 02:51:18.695]  I think so.
[02:51:38.556 --> 02:51:40.397]  Waiting for the side effects disclaimers?
[02:51:40.397 --> 02:51:42.878]  With MDS Forte, there are none.
[02:51:42.878 --> 02:51:45.660]  Order a 25-day treatment of MDS Forte by calling 213-405-5355.
[02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:45.760]  213-405-5355.
[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:47.120]  Or visit BestBloodSupport.com.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:50.402]  That's BestBloodSupport.com for MDS Forte, a diabetes breakthrough.
[02:52:01.147 --> 02:52:02.568]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.568 --> 02:52:13.238]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:13.238 --> 02:52:20.104]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:52:20.444 --> 02:52:31.712]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:52:31.712 --> 02:52:35.215]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:52:35.215 --> 02:52:41.359]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:52:41.359 --> 02:52:48.625]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:52.006]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[02:53:04.972 --> 02:53:07.854]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior?
[02:53:07.854 --> 02:53:08.995]  Staining your teeth?
[02:53:08.995 --> 02:53:10.997]  And getting ashes everywhere?
[02:53:10.997 --> 02:53:11.637]  Why?
[02:53:11.637 --> 02:53:15.980]  When you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[02:54:16.643 --> 02:54:20.166]  Thank you for joining us here on the InfoWars Frontlines.
[02:54:20.166 --> 02:54:24.730]  I'm Mike Adams, joined by Robert Scott Bell right now to finish out the show for you today.
[02:54:24.730 --> 02:54:25.790]  Happy Thanksgiving!
[02:54:26.553 --> 02:54:28.234]  To all of you.
[02:54:28.234 --> 02:54:31.876]  And we've been talking about things that we are thankful for on this Thanksgiving.
[02:54:31.876 --> 02:54:33.957]  I want to mention the next item on my list.
[02:54:33.957 --> 02:54:35.498]  I'm thankful for the spirit of 1776.
[02:54:35.498 --> 02:54:47.644]  Yeah, that spirit that is part of the American fabric, the culture of questioning government, of asking these questions and then taking action as necessary.
[02:54:48.544 --> 02:54:54.906]  To put government in its place to protect our freedoms rather than dominating over us as tyrants.
[02:54:54.906 --> 02:55:01.508]  I think the spirit of 1776 is very strong in this country and that we will prevail peacefully.
[02:55:01.508 --> 02:55:01.948]  Yes.
[02:55:01.948 --> 02:55:02.868]  That's the key question.
[02:55:02.868 --> 02:55:05.609]  Any comments on that Robert before we go to our caller?
[02:55:06.269 --> 02:55:13.013]  It's in our DNA, absolutely, as Americans, and I found that to be, you know, no slight to anybody else around the world.
[02:55:13.013 --> 02:55:15.735]  You know, I don't come from ego when I say that.
[02:55:15.735 --> 02:55:22.719]  But there is something unique and special about the American Republic and its foundation and origin, and it's still alive.
[02:55:22.719 --> 02:55:28.102]  But many people are afraid of it, even within America, because they have been, you know, wussified.
[02:55:28.102 --> 02:55:30.604]  We've talked about the wussification of America.
[02:55:30.604 --> 02:55:33.245]  I'm not all that grateful for the wussies, but...
[02:55:34.386 --> 02:55:36.908]  They're there to help them when they get the courage back.
[02:55:36.908 --> 02:55:45.876]  Maybe they'll get some courage from you and others that are standing up as we bring out that Second American Revolution here that we're in the midst of, a peaceful one as we say.
[02:55:45.876 --> 02:55:54.984]  Well as Dr. Lonky said, we're here to wake up their parasympathetic nervous systems and for the TSA officers, we're here to wake up your unsympathetic nervous systems too.
[02:55:54.984 --> 02:55:57.987]  Alright, let's go to caller John in Ohio.
[02:55:57.987 --> 02:56:00.669]  You're on the air with Mike Adams and Robert Scott Bell.
[02:56:00.669 --> 02:56:01.190]  How you doing today?
[02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:02.451]  Well, pretty good.
[02:56:02.451 --> 02:56:08.778]  I didn't call it my primary to mention this, but I want to start out with it now after the last call.
[02:56:08.778 --> 02:56:13.183]  I happened to take a bus trip with Middle Americans through Western Europe.
[02:56:13.183 --> 02:56:16.246]  It included Western Berlin.
[02:56:16.246 --> 02:56:19.470]  And you have a one-day pass to go into East Berlin.
[02:56:20.134 --> 02:56:20.754]  I went there.
[02:56:20.754 --> 02:56:22.215]  I had absolutely no trouble.
[02:56:22.215 --> 02:56:23.896]  The people were well-dressed.
[02:56:23.896 --> 02:56:28.557]  I spent the entire day there eating sausages and seeing a fashion show downtown.
[02:56:28.557 --> 02:56:30.998]  I was even an hour late in getting out.
[02:56:30.998 --> 02:56:32.159]  They gave me no problem.
[02:56:32.159 --> 02:56:34.860]  They just made a call and I went across the
[02:56:35.413 --> 02:56:37.214]  To the West Berlin side.
[02:56:37.214 --> 02:56:42.535]  So I think people ought to check out some of the lies we're told about history.
[02:56:42.535 --> 02:56:47.376]  I'd recommend just looking up on a search on a computer lies concerning the Soviet Union.
[02:56:47.376 --> 02:56:48.757]  Okay.
[02:56:48.757 --> 02:56:57.419]  And also, I did want to mention that I have a feeling that if we don't question these big lie premises,
[02:56:57.961 --> 02:57:20.494]  And just say, well, even though it's a lie that the American government is saintly and benevolently trying to protect us from terrorists when we know it's inside jobs, if we say, yes, we know these countries that the United States is devastating and attacking and slaughtering are really bad countries that are doing all the things that the CIA media tells us they're doing,
[02:57:20.925 --> 02:57:25.150]  We lose the argument, and I have that difference with Ron Paul.
[02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:27.432]  That's why I respect Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:57:27.432 --> 02:57:31.577]  He doesn't censor himself on that, and Webster Tarpley does not.
[02:57:31.577 --> 02:57:39.285]  He's been in these countries, and he tells us all the things we're being told about Iran and Syria right now are a pile of lies.
[02:57:39.965 --> 02:57:50.493]  You're absolutely right, and I greatly admire Paul Craig Roberts as well, but you know, just about Ron Paul, he knows much more than what he talks about, but think about it.
[02:57:50.493 --> 02:57:56.137]  You can't go up on stage in front of the American people and tell them the whole truth when you're running for president.
[02:57:56.137 --> 02:57:57.398]  They're not ready for that yet.
[02:57:57.998 --> 02:58:04.019]  Maybe you can on InfoWars, you can tell people the whole truth, but not on stage in a presidential election.
[02:58:04.019 --> 02:58:05.040]  I appreciate your call, though.
[02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:06.280]  Some really good comments.
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:09.721]  I want to take time for the next caller, Dave in California.
[02:58:09.721 --> 02:58:10.881]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:58:10.881 --> 02:58:11.581]  Go ahead, please.
[02:58:11.581 --> 02:58:14.542]  Yeah, real quick, Dave.
[02:58:14.542 --> 02:58:14.922]  20 seconds.
[02:58:18.951 --> 02:58:19.471]  Absolutely.
[02:58:19.471 --> 02:58:26.236]  You know, as far as any wild meat is concerned, I would go to your local Korean BBQ and order some UK.
[02:58:26.236 --> 02:58:29.238]  I think I'd like the British Isle.
[02:58:29.238 --> 02:58:30.219]  Okay, okay.
[02:58:30.219 --> 02:58:31.480]  Sorry man, we're out of time.
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:32.521]  I want to thank everybody.
[02:58:32.521 --> 02:58:34.802]  Join us on InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[02:58:34.802 --> 02:58:37.124]  Happy Thanksgiving and thank you for joining us today.
[02:58:37.124 --> 02:58:39.185]  It's been a pleasure and an honor hosting.
[02:58:39.185 --> 02:58:39.506]  Take care.
