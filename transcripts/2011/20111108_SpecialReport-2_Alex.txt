[00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.771]  Thanks Alex.
[00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:07.976]  We're standing outside of Hopdoddy's, a local hamburger restaurant located in South Austin.
[00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:16.664]  Now this is just one of the many restaurants in town choosing organic and locally produced ingredients over GMO and conventionally farmed foods.
[00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:20.448]  However, Hopdoddy's has taken this trend one step further.
[00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:26.714]  They're also removing the fluoride as well as other toxins from the drinking water that they serve their customers.
[00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:29.306]  You'd be surprised.
[00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.272]  It's a small percentage that really appreciate it.
[00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:36.842]  But the ones that do understand what fluoride does to you, they are ecstatic.
[00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:37.924]  They love seeing that.
[00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:46.671]  Sodium fluoride is a chemical byproduct of aluminum, phosphate, cement, steel, and nuclear weapons manufacturing.
[00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:59.396]  It reduces IQ, impairs memory and learning, it has shown to poison kidney function, it causes bone disease as well as reduce thyroid activity, and is a proven cause of cancer.
[00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:04.699]  Well, not only is it bad for humans, it's also bad for animals of all kinds as well.
[00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.803]  I just don't understand why fluoride needs to be in the water to begin with.
[00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:11.265]  I do not think it belongs in our water supply.
[00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:15.448]  I said it's for promoting tooth health, oral hygiene, stuff like that.
[00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:16.609]  It's supposed to be good for your teeth.
[00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.194]  Anything in the water supply doesn't sound like something that I'd be for.
[00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:28.279]  So if I know something's being put into a water supply that doesn't necessarily have to be there, I'd rather it not be there.
[00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:39.547]  Back in elementary school they made you like gargle that stuff and like and like wash your mouth out with it but I just remember it made me sick every time I had it so it's like I don't know if it needs to be in my water.
[00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:40.787]  I think it's just awful.
[00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:43.229]  I don't think anything should be added to the water supply that doesn't need to be added.
[00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.511]  And it just it just sounds scary.
[00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:50.654]  Anything that's being put into a city's water supply without without everybody's consent.
[00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:57.439]  So would you like to see all the restaurants turn the corner like you are and remove the fluoride from the drinking water that they serve their customers?
[00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.475]  Well, I'd like to see the city turn the corner and remove all the fluoride and not burden everyone with putting RO systems in their restaurants.
[00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:06.835]  I think that'd be the best way to do it.
[00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:12.459]  But I think that we can get the word out by doing that and I would love to see more restaurants do that.
[00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:18.815]  Well, you know, a lot of advocates are starting to educate people, and more and more people are becoming aware of the dangers of sodium fluoride.
[00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:27.327]  In fact, right down the street, Hopdoddy's, they've made a conscious decision to remove the sodium fluoride from the drinking water that they serve their customers.
[00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:28.469]  What do you think about that?
[00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:29.509]  I think it's great.
[00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.570]  I actually go over there quite a bit.
[00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.670]  I appreciate it, yeah.
[00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.451]  I don't want... They can filter out anything.
[00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:35.811]  The more filtration of the water, the better.
[00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.492]  I think it's great that they're standing by something.
[00:02:38.832 --> 00:02:39.412]  They believe in it.
[00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:41.432]  I'd like it if a lot more businesses started to do that.
[00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:45.894]  They actually spent the money to take it out of their own water supply.
[00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:46.674]  I think that's pretty cool.
[00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:48.895]  They don't need to spend money to take it out.
[00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.857]  It just needs to not be there to begin with.
[00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:55.480]  I'd like it personally if Austin stopped putting the fluoride in the water altogether.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.185]  The majority of people we talk to on the street flat out don't approve of sodium fluoride being added to their water.
[00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:11.932]  Which is why we applaud individual activists and activist groups like the Fluoride Action Network who stand in the way of fluoridating public water supplies.
[00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:17.683]  And thanks to restaurants like HopDotty's playing a role in the health of their customers and their community.
[00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:20.789]  I'm Darren McBreen for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.151]  Alex, back to you.
