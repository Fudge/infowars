[00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:06.376]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:08.138]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:09.900]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.501]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:13.023]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.023 --> 00:00:17.228]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:21.312]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:28.896]  Think about how incredibly disgusting this is.
[00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:42.761]  You have the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Queen of the Netherlands, representatives of the Queen of England, all of these big oil company heads, the heads of the top banks in the planet, the people that have created the derivatives, the people that have
[00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.384]  Bought off our politicians worldwide.
[00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:51.233]  Two years ago they came in and openly bought off the Greek government, put their president in, put their finance minister in.
[00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:58.383]  You look at countries all over the world, they got Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, former people in the revolving door, working.
[00:00:59.384 --> 00:00:59.564]  Yeah.
[00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:23.013]  Make trillions of dollars and individuals are paid billions and billions and billions in bonuses.
[00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:30.695]  And as the water prices are increased so the government can quote pay off the debts they don't owe in Ireland and Greece and the United States.
[00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:38.537]  As taxes are raised everywhere and as the services are cut, the people are told they're cutting services for austerity to pay off the debt.
[00:01:38.537 --> 00:01:44.979]  But if you look at Eastern Europe, you look at Latin America, you look at Western countries that have been taken over by these people, you never get out of the debt.
[00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:46.499]  Because it's impossible.
[00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.980]  It's 1.5 quadrillion.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.100]  It's fraudulent.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:01.823]  That would have been like telling Germans in the Great Depression in 1932 that they had to pay off every individual family's debt of trillions of marks.
[00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:06.224]  You know, it took billions of marks to buy a loaf of bread.
[00:02:06.224 --> 00:02:09.485]  USA Today yesterday had the cover story
[00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:17.250]  That it's really 60 plus trillion dollars that the United States quote owes.
[00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.351]  Well, I'm sorry, last year the Washington Post reported the U.S.
[00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:27.495]  share of derivatives is 600 trillion of the 1.5 quadrillion worldwide.
[00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:29.656]  It's impossible to pay off.
[00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:31.277]  We don't owe it.
[00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:32.638]  It's a fraud.
[00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:34.259]  We are incredibly wealthy.
[00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:44.146]  But they've invested the police pension funds, the fire funds, the teacher funds, the private funds, everything in these systems.
[00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:49.412]  And now they're holding us hostage saying, give us whatever we want, cut all your benefits or you'll get nothing.
[00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:50.485]  That's
[00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:08.076]  Watch!
[00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:13.582]  They're gonna have trillions more in quote bailouts that are really just blood money paid to these criminals.
[00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:16.384]  And they'll be back in a couple more years for more, more, more.
[00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:22.130]  And the deeper the depression gets, they'll say cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, pay us everything and we'll fix it.
[00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.634]  Then you cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, pay them everything and it only gets worse.
[00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:27.956]  I mean, here's Obama.
[00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:29.255]  And
[00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:46.251]  I don't
[00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:21.094]  I'm not a fan of the socialist model because I know it was created by the banksters on record to get you dependent so they can then hold you hostage and control the entire system and have everything under federal systems that tie into the world government.
[00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.716]  But here's Obama, and we told you this was coming.
[00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:28.119]  Obama presses Europe, pledges help for Greek crisis.
[00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:30.521]  They've already had three rounds of bailouts there.
[00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:34.864]  Greece has lost its credit rating, just like Moody's and Standard & Poor's says the U.S.
[00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:35.444]  is.
[00:04:35.444 --> 00:04:36.625]  So it's more, more, more.
[00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:39.046]  The more you pay the bankers, the more you owe them.
[00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:46.671]  Because when our countries create a dollar to bail someone out, a dollar of debt is created to the very bankers that we're bailing out.
[00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.793]  It's like a snake eating its tail.
[00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:53.396]  The fraud is so huge and so simple, it makes it complex and people can't see it.
[00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:54.757]  It's us or them.
[00:04:54.757 --> 00:04:56.438]  It's us or them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:58.339]  We're coming back with more coverage.
[00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.020]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:15.515]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:19.197]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:32.979]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:40.245]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:51.287]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:55.228]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:59.928]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:05.329]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:07.610]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:10.953]  We're good to go.
[00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:35.429]  And that you are insane if you talk about it.
[00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:38.771]  That's why I get countless emails of people talking about their family members.
[00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:43.353]  If they talk about it at dinner, visiting their parents or their children or their neighbors, they are laughed at.
[00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:51.708]  Because the average mind-numb person out there thinks they're on the winning team if they laugh at people that have more knowledge than them.
[00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:55.750]  We now have the full 2011 official attendee list.
[00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.731]  It is bombshell.
[00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:58.172]  We'll be breaking it down.
[00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:01.213]  It's up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:02.554]  Drudge is also linked to it.
[00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:04.455]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:06.076]  Also, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:07.337]  There's a video on the site.
[00:07:07.337 --> 00:07:10.438]  Breaks down the official Bilderberg 2011 attendee list.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.561]  I think so.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.120]  We're good to go.
[00:07:48.252 --> 00:07:53.153]  It's all coming up today, but I take you now to Paul Watson in St.
[00:07:53.153 --> 00:07:56.634]  Moritz, Switzerland, the site of Bilderberg 2011 with a lot of big developments.
[00:07:56.634 --> 00:08:11.817]  He's also with WeAreChange out of Switzerland, and WeAreChange founder Luke Rudowsky, also RT reporter and InfoWars.com roving reporter with some big breaking news on the staged bomb threat that even The Guardian is reporting.
[00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:13.217]  It was staged.
[00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:15.738]  We, of course, first broke that news here yesterday because our team
[00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:18.801]  He's working so hard, doing such a great job.
[00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.826]  We go now to Paul Joseph Watson with a report on the latest developments.
[00:08:22.826 --> 00:08:26.691]  Then he'll hand the phone off to Luke Rudowsky of We Are Change.
[00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.333]  Paul, break down the latest developments.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.900]  Hi Alex.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.803]  Yeah, we're at an event that's just up the hill from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[00:08:35.803 --> 00:08:47.168]  About an hour ago we actually went in the field that's just above the hotel, just outside the police line, and we were able to film live footage which was streamed on Justin TV.
[00:08:47.948 --> 00:08:57.492]  Of the helicopter picking up one of the Bilderberg members, we believe it to be a woman, and it flew off over the mountains, so we got some pretty good live footage.
[00:08:57.492 --> 00:09:12.738]  And then afterwards we were interviewing Dominique of We Are Change Switzerland, and he was telling us about a big breaking story involving the Swiss politician Dominique Betig, who before the conference had called for
[00:09:13.258 --> 00:09:16.581]  Henry Kissinger to be arrested as a war criminal.
[00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:23.467]  And I'm going to hand you over to Dominique so he can explain the letter that is now being presented to the Swiss.
[00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:25.609]  Okay, and tell us who Dominique is again.
[00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:28.532]  Tell us who Dominique is before you give him the phone.
[00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:31.675]  Dominique is from We Are Change Switzerland.
[00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:35.038]  Okay, Dominique, good to speak with you, sir.
[00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:37.780]  Give us this report.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.981]  Okay, yesterday,
[00:09:40.404 --> 00:09:54.430]  We went to the Soberetta Hotel, the Bilderberg Hotel, where they meet, and we brought a letter from the Swiss legislature, Dominic Petzig, who stated that different journalists were intimidated by the police.
[00:09:54.430 --> 00:10:04.075]  They were followed by cars with the German numbers in Switzerland, and black windows, and things like that.
[00:10:05.234 --> 00:10:11.040]  Patrick wrote an official letter that we handed out to the Chief of the Region, Barbara Yonam Steiner.
[00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:18.578]  To get sure that the journalists can do their work and that the coverage is done about the Bilderbergs.
[00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:25.945]  Because he knows what the agenda is from the Bilderbergers and he doesn't want them to meet in Switzerland.
[00:10:25.945 --> 00:10:27.767]  They should go away, he said.
[00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:37.456]  And tonight he will come to confront the event managers about the case that Henry Kissinger is coming to Switzerland.
[00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:39.437]  This is big news, sir.
[00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:49.704]  And again, you've already had a member of the equivalent of your Congress come out earlier in the week and call for the arrest of Kissinger.
[00:10:49.704 --> 00:10:50.585]  Is this the same?
[00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.806]  Now explain your government system.
[00:10:52.806 --> 00:10:58.650]  Explain your government system and exactly who he is and his name again and who's talked to him.
[00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.031]  It sounds like you've talked to him.
[00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:01.072]  You have the official letter.
[00:11:01.072 --> 00:11:03.793]  He's already in the papers saying he wants Kissinger arrested.
[00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:07.756]  You're saying he is coming today to confront the police.
[00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:10.278]  It's not the only one.
[00:11:10.278 --> 00:11:19.628]  There are two other legislators coming up there in the Hotel Rundelins where we stay at an event that they talk about the Bilderberg meetings and their agenda.
[00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:31.239]  And so we have in Switzerland a subsidiary system so the people, the local people can do politics and then it's go up and up.
[00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:35.141]  To the federal system.
[00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:40.864]  So it's not a centralized system where in the central laws are being...
[00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:57.872]  For those that don't know, the United States, more than the Greeks and Romans, as we were told by modern historians, the United States, if you read the Founding Fathers, was actually founded off a Dutch model that was then exported to Switzerland.
[00:11:57.872 --> 00:12:05.974]  Switzerland already had a similar model, where you actually have your states, of course under another name, you have your, what, cantons, correct?
[00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:13.944]  Yes, you have your states for those that don't know, and they are the supreme power.
[00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:21.185]  They then vote and completely order the vassal federal body around as our republic was established.
[00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:26.367]  We now have it completely backwards here in the United States, and that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:31.068]  And so some of the leaders of the states, hence leaders of the federal government,
[00:12:31.648 --> 00:12:34.371]  Because the states run your federal government are coming.
[00:12:34.371 --> 00:12:35.832]  You're saying three of them.
[00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:39.976]  We do have the mainstream Swiss papers from two days ago where he was saying he wants them arrested.
[00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:42.939]  Your prime minister has said they shouldn't be meeting there as well.
[00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:44.280]  So what you're saying is confirmed there.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.542]  But this is big, breaking news.
[00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:54.569]  This is the first time I've ever heard of this, that the leaders of a government are going to be going and confronting the criminals that are meeting there.
[00:12:54.569 --> 00:12:56.051]  Any other details you can give us, sir?
[00:12:57.369 --> 00:13:00.471]  Yeah, there are other things.
[00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:14.658]  The National Legislature said that if something's going to happen, if blood is on the street, the whole responsibility has to be taken by the chief of the region, who is also attending at the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:15.738]  But it states that
[00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:37.928]  Stop all the scaring of the journalists and let them get their work out and do the big coverage of the Bilderberg meeting because in a country like Switzerland, if we have direct democracy, the people should be informed about this meeting and that we have an article, article 266
[00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:50.353]  That states that our politicians cannot meet in secret with other politicians from other states, other countries, foreign countries.
[00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:51.294]  Yeah, it's called treason.
[00:13:51.294 --> 00:13:52.674]  We have the Logan Act as well.
[00:13:52.674 --> 00:13:54.655]  Yeah, it's called treason.
[00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:56.816]  It's like the Logan Act, yeah.
[00:13:56.816 --> 00:14:09.481]  And so it's an illegal thing and he repeated this that he don't want to be a part of this system where the Bilderberg can get a platform in this country.
[00:14:11.925 --> 00:14:20.017]  Well amazing sir, now to be specific, you're with We Are Change, Luke Rodowski is there as well, Paul Watson is with you, but you've seen the letter?
[00:14:20.017 --> 00:14:22.281]  I mean, how do you know the letter?
[00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:22.982]  Have you seen the letter?
[00:14:23.985 --> 00:14:24.685]  Yes, yes.
[00:14:24.685 --> 00:14:26.666]  I wrote a letter to the legislator.
[00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.907]  In Switzerland, you can reach your legislators.
[00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:30.248]  Wrote them letters.
[00:14:30.248 --> 00:14:36.671]  And if you know them, if you're going outside to meet them, talk with them, they are trying to help you.
[00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:39.692]  There's a few politicians who have the balls to help you.
[00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:41.053]  Well, sir, you're amazing!
[00:14:41.553 --> 00:14:42.154]  You're amazing.
[00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:54.343]  Give us your full name, because you deserve great credit doing the right thing and going to your representatives, your servants, your legates, so the people that serve you, your representative, and getting them to do the right thing.
[00:14:54.343 --> 00:15:07.133]  This is going to be very, very historical, and obviously we've got to have our team there covering it, and we'll have our team there covering it, and more on that live in the third hour, literally with their cell phones, as this happens at the gates of Bilderberg.
[00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:08.775]  But specifically, give us your full name, sir.
[00:15:10.154 --> 00:15:16.879]  I just want to mention that we are a lot of people here and it's the work of everybody here.
[00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:21.523]  And I wonder if the police are gonna try to keep their boss from delivering this letter.
[00:15:24.278 --> 00:15:27.960]  I think the Swiss police are very patriotic.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.741]  Some of them even are.
[00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:34.804]  And they didn't know what they are protecting.
[00:15:34.804 --> 00:15:47.092]  We have to inform them about the attendees and about the whole Bilderberg meeting that was built up by a Nazi, Prince Bernhard.
[00:16:00.148 --> 00:16:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:04.691 --> 00:16:05.612]  Number 1.
[00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:09.035]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:09.895]  Number 2.
[00:16:09.895 --> 00:16:14.779]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:15.519]  It's true.
[00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:20.403]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:21.224]  Number 3.
[00:16:21.224 --> 00:16:24.806]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:24.806 --> 00:16:28.489]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:29.510]  Number 4.
[00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.272]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:16:32.272 --> 00:16:35.956]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:16:35.956 --> 00:16:36.737]  Number 5.
[00:16:36.737 --> 00:16:40.900]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.645]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:12.604]  From the front.
[00:20:12.604 --> 00:20:17.045]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:20:17.045 --> 00:20:18.926]  Here to build the big guns.
[00:20:21.363 --> 00:20:26.805]  Yeah, they're hiding behind walls.
[00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:32.908]  They're hiding behind their desk.
[00:20:32.908 --> 00:20:36.049]  I can see through your mask.
[00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:38.711]  It's a bill to destroy.
[00:20:49.898 --> 00:20:52.942]  Play with my world.
[00:20:52.942 --> 00:21:00.231]  Like it's your little toy.
[00:21:00.231 --> 00:21:01.453]  You that ain't ever done nothin'.
[00:21:09.197 --> 00:21:11.259]  And you run fast.
[00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:19.266]  Yep, they're the ones gearing up the wars.
[00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:25.732]  Launching the war right now in Libya, launching the new bombing campaigns in Yemen, the secret airstrikes.
[00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:35.437]  And there we are confronting him, drawing attention, and now a high-level Swiss politician, open letters signed by two others.
[00:21:35.437 --> 00:21:36.538]  My guys have seen the letters.
[00:21:36.538 --> 00:21:37.580]  They're going to get copies of it.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.465]  We're going to get it up on the continually updated news feed at InfoWars.com.
[00:21:42.465 --> 00:21:45.528]  Actually confronting the real illegitimate criminal government.
[00:21:45.808 --> 00:21:47.670]  The hijackers of our society.
[00:22:04.987 --> 00:22:06.889]  Big demonstration at high noon.
[00:22:06.889 --> 00:22:10.872]  I know there's a lot more people there today, but we're less than 24 hours.
[00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:16.656]  We're like 18 hours or something now out from the big demonstration at high noon tomorrow there in St.
[00:22:16.656 --> 00:22:17.297]  Moritz.
[00:22:17.297 --> 00:22:18.798]  Watson, any other points to add?
[00:22:18.798 --> 00:22:25.203]  I mean, that was bombshell information that we just received right there.
[00:22:25.203 --> 00:22:31.348]  Yeah, we're gonna have to stay up here and film it, and I guess Kurt is gonna write the article.
[00:22:31.348 --> 00:22:32.069]  Is that what's happening?
[00:22:32.808 --> 00:22:40.476]  Yeah, and we've got to, with the Swiss, get a hold of that office and make sure exactly when he's arriving, we've got to get that on tape and march with him up there.
[00:22:40.476 --> 00:22:45.822]  Because if he doesn't have people backing him, who knows what they'll do to him.
[00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:52.029]  And again, this is the equivalent of Ron Paul marching, Swiss Ron Paul, literally marching up to Bilderberg.
[00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:54.351]  This is sensational.
[00:22:55.012 --> 00:23:00.356]  It is sensational the amount of attention this is going to draw to the real shadow enemies.
[00:23:00.356 --> 00:23:11.403]  Once we identify these vampires in the light of high noon, today and tomorrow, this is another devastating blow as we show people that there are little men behind the curtain, they're not the great Oz, they're not invincible.
[00:23:11.403 --> 00:23:15.006]  What is happening is historical to say the least.
[00:23:15.006 --> 00:23:16.027]  If you just joined us,
[00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:19.549]  Three Swiss ministers have signed a letter.
[00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:22.251]  It has been delivered to the Bilderberg Group.
[00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:28.835]  The police have now backed off harassing media and one of their highest level members of their slash Congress.
[00:23:30.213 --> 00:23:31.734]  It's called their canton.
[00:23:31.734 --> 00:23:33.355]  It's the Council of the States.
[00:23:33.355 --> 00:23:40.059]  He's going to go to Bilderberg and demand to be let in, and is going to confront and try to have Henry Kissinger arrested.
[00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:43.182]  This is off the charts delicious.
[00:23:43.182 --> 00:23:45.563]  I know we can beat the globalist.
[00:23:45.563 --> 00:23:50.747]  I know that who has the fight wins, who is in the right wins when they fight.
[00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:54.189]  Resistance is victory.
[00:23:54.189 --> 00:23:57.111]  My children's future, your children's future, free humanity.
[00:23:57.827 --> 00:23:59.108]  The spirit of 1776.
[00:23:59.108 --> 00:24:05.135]  Everything we are is about standing up and marching on Bilderberg today and tomorrow.
[00:24:06.124 --> 00:24:12.947]  This is off the chart exciting, and I take you now, I believe we've gotten him online, to Mark Anderson.
[00:24:12.947 --> 00:24:19.610]  He is one of the chief reporters, I believe he's even the editor, over there at American Free Press.
[00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.952]  And he writes on news across the nation, AmericanFreePress.net, the colleague of Jim Tucker.
[00:24:24.952 --> 00:24:28.794]  And Mr. Anderson, it's good to have you there.
[00:24:28.794 --> 00:24:33.036]  Are you as energized and excited as I am about these bombshell developments?
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.786]  Absolutely, and you know, it's kind of a mixture of activists and Sherlock Holmes.
[00:24:38.786 --> 00:24:47.357]  You know, the Bilderbergers are an intrigue kind of group, and you have to be a kind of a sleuth and an activist at the same time, but I'm very excited.
[00:24:48.925 --> 00:25:03.931]  What do you make of the fact that this letter's been delivered, the cops have suddenly begun to really behave themselves, and are having the reporters get closer, because, you know, there it's direct democracy, and their boss has told them, you're protecting criminals.
[00:25:03.931 --> 00:25:15.356]  We're told the police are really starting to wake up, and now this member of the government, this member, uh, Cantonian leader, is gonna be arriving soon to try to get into Bilderberg.
[00:25:15.356 --> 00:25:17.657]  This is Bilderberg under siege, Mark.
[00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:20.189]  Absolutely.
[00:25:20.189 --> 00:25:24.730]  I think we're talking about Dominique Betig, the National Council member of the Swiss People's Party?
[00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.250]  Yes.
[00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:35.512]  Yeah, Dominique, as you probably know, had written letters to Simonetta Samaruga, the federal civil law enforcement officer who's a member of the Federal Council.
[00:25:35.512 --> 00:25:42.174]  And then Mrs. Barbara Genome-Steiner, and she's the cantonal cop, top officer.
[00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:48.695]  And not only did they not initially respond to Betig, but Genome-Steiner, she actually is attending Bilderberg.
[00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:59.943]  So initially there was a slap in the face to Dominic Beitig in his initial letters pleading to these top law enforcement officers not to even allow Bilderberg to meet here in the first place.
[00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:01.645]  So they snubbed
[00:26:02.578 --> 00:26:18.315]  Uh, Dominic may take this, um, traditionalist minded legislator, but, uh, what we're hearing now, which is what you're talking about, he's not taking this lying down and he's gonna ignore their, their cold shoulder and, and, and evidently be very proactive about this.
[00:26:18.315 --> 00:26:21.138]  So that, that takes a lot of courage.
[00:26:21.138 --> 00:26:23.060]  A great deal of courage on Dominic's part.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.742]  Mark, I know you are, um,
[00:26:26.278 --> 00:26:34.483]  Really second only to somebody like Jim Tucker and your deep years of research and following Bilderberg and you've been to many of these events.
[00:26:34.483 --> 00:26:46.690]  Am I right in saying that nothing like this has ever happened and that this is a major watershed bellwether flashpoint event?
[00:26:48.183 --> 00:26:50.184]  I believe so, in many ways.
[00:26:50.184 --> 00:26:52.845]  Jim and I were discussing this earlier.
[00:26:52.845 --> 00:27:05.971]  First of all, he cannot remember, he goes back like 35 years, he cannot remember ever there being a national legislator of a host country to Bilderberg raising this kind of ruckus in this manner.
[00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:12.854]  Actually trying to prevent Bilderberg from meeting, and when he couldn't do that, then going to this next step and delivering this protest.
[00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:16.079]  Apparently in person in front of Bilderberg.
[00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:22.030]  So this is unprecedented and according to Jim who just told me this this morning and he's been covering this for 35 years.
[00:27:24.783 --> 00:27:27.306]  And then you have the other factors involved.
[00:27:27.306 --> 00:27:34.132]  They're taking, this meeting's taking place in a country whose traditions run exactly against the grain of Gilderberg.
[00:27:34.132 --> 00:27:36.314]  They want centralized control.
[00:27:36.314 --> 00:27:40.839]  The Swiss believe in kind of a populist, home rule, grassroots style of government.
[00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:42.760]  It's just a no-fit all the way.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.305]  They shouldn't be here philosophically, culturally, for any reason.
[00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:48.306]  They don't belong here.
[00:27:48.846 --> 00:27:51.728]  They don't belong anywhere, really, but they definitely don't belong here.
[00:27:51.728 --> 00:27:55.671]  And I think that's what they take to be, that this would tarnish the Swiss system.
[00:27:55.671 --> 00:27:57.812]  It would tarnish their reputation.
[00:27:57.812 --> 00:28:09.660]  And he probably suspects that some of their deliberations might be how to get Switzerland into the European Union, so it's not the sticky wicket in their mad quest for a unified Europe.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:27.085]  And notice as soon as they have the second vote and finally force the success story Ireland into the EU, they immediately by design through the ministers they controlled, the traders inside Ireland, economically imploded them and handed literally the lion's share of their taxes over to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:28:27.085 --> 00:28:29.506]  And that's what they want to do to Switzerland.
[00:28:29.506 --> 00:28:31.687]  And so, you know, the hour is getting late.
[00:28:31.687 --> 00:28:33.468]  The global crisis is on.
[00:28:33.468 --> 00:28:37.709]  The crimes of Bilderberg are known and people are identifying them as the enemy.
[00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:55.690]  As people like yourself and the protesters continually to doggedly expose Bilderberg, being laughed at, being told it doesn't exist, ha ha ha, now we see it all coming to a head as the global ultra-rich, the richest, most powerful royalty and banking heads and oil company heads meet.
[00:29:01.383 --> 00:29:03.085]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:08.392]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.

[00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:26.969]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:29:26.969 --> 00:29:34.973]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:05.357]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.357 --> 00:30:08.780]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.640]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.524 --> 00:30:15.265]  It's true.
[00:30:15.265 --> 00:30:20.149]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.970]  Number 3.
[00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.553]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.553 --> 00:30:28.256]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.456 --> 00:30:29.256]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:31.997]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:35.678]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.678 --> 00:30:36.478]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.478 --> 00:30:40.619]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:45.681]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:01.311 --> 00:32:05.272]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:14.134]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.134 --> 00:32:18.755]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.755 --> 00:32:29.577]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.197 --> 00:32:39.719]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.719 --> 00:32:45.141]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:52.622]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.622 --> 00:32:55.383]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:04.793]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.793 --> 00:33:15.436]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:15.436 --> 00:33:22.898]  Agents that literally carry the spark of God's love in their hearts for their children and our cultures are everywhere.
[00:33:22.898 --> 00:33:30.020]  And the globalists have their legions of paid off scum and psychopaths and sociopaths and bullies and control freaks.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:52.225]  But it's always free humanity that isn't rallied until things get really bad, and then good people finally come out of their trance, wake up, and that's why the evil ones are so scared of good people, because they want to intimidate us and make us feel weak, because they can literally, at a spiritual, instinctive level, we are like thousand-foot giants to them, because we're in the right.
[00:33:52.225 --> 00:33:54.925]  And the wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:33:54.925 --> 00:33:58.326]  Well, we are pursuing, and that's why they flee and hide, Mark Anderson.
[00:33:59.847 --> 00:34:04.951]  Yeah, I think that for all their great wealth, they're the poorest people on the planet.
[00:34:04.951 --> 00:34:12.756]  They're, culturally and in their soul, in their intellect, in their spirit, they're poorer than dirt.
[00:34:12.756 --> 00:34:14.037]  And I think they know that.
[00:34:14.037 --> 00:34:19.140]  All they have is money and power, which are ephemeral things, things that slip away.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:27.526]  I think they sense their own mortality, individually and collectively, that there's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide, they're not going to get away with it because we're not going to let them.
[00:34:27.526 --> 00:34:28.747]  It's just that simple.
[00:34:29.407 --> 00:34:37.651]  And, you know, even if they were meeting for the best of reasons, and everything was peaches and cream, you're still not supposed to have secret decisions being made.
[00:34:37.651 --> 00:34:38.971]  See, that's what people don't understand.
[00:34:38.971 --> 00:34:43.153]  Secrecy is never good, even if the best intentions are there.
[00:34:43.153 --> 00:34:47.095]  And we know they don't have the best intentions, so it's a double whammy.
[00:34:47.095 --> 00:34:49.936]  You know, it's just there's no way they can explain their way out of this.
[00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:51.817]  It's undemocratic, it's wrong.
[00:34:51.817 --> 00:34:55.559]  Even if they're voting to send money to the poor every week, they need to do it in the open.
[00:34:56.072 --> 00:35:00.053]  But, you know, openness to them is, you know, just anathema.
[00:35:00.053 --> 00:35:04.195]  They don't even understand what that's about, you know?
[00:35:04.195 --> 00:35:07.976]  It's just... It's almost sad.
[00:35:07.976 --> 00:35:11.057]  I mean, they're really... I pity them as much as I loathe them.
[00:35:13.902 --> 00:35:14.703]  Well, you're right.
[00:35:14.703 --> 00:35:24.329]  Mark Anderson, looking at the agenda, for folks that just joined us, we're covering Bilderberg 2011, a day that will be remembered for a long time.
[00:35:24.329 --> 00:35:25.930]  Very exciting.
[00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:33.455]  The equivalent of a Ron Paul of Switzerland, that's what he's known as, heading up one of the cantons.
[00:35:33.455 --> 00:35:36.297]  And again, their states then combine to make the federal government.
[00:35:36.297 --> 00:35:39.960]  It's direct state rule, people rule, what the republic once had through the states.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.021]  I don't know.
[00:35:56.397 --> 00:36:03.022]  Recapping how big this is, we're going to put, when we can, the letter back on screen that's been delivered by Luke Radowski.
[00:36:03.022 --> 00:36:07.685]  And later today, in the next few hours, the leader of this canton is going to come there.
[00:36:07.685 --> 00:36:10.026]  He's already sent it out to the prosecutors, the police.
[00:36:10.026 --> 00:36:12.388]  He's told them, look, you're in violation of law.
[00:36:12.388 --> 00:36:13.028]  I'm coming.
[00:36:13.028 --> 00:36:13.969]  I'm your boss.
[00:36:13.969 --> 00:36:14.469]  Look out.
[00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:16.210]  This is a showdown.
[00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.511]  This is a showdown.
[00:36:17.511 --> 00:36:18.352]  This is big.
[00:36:20.271 --> 00:36:21.191]  It's major.
[00:36:21.191 --> 00:36:23.972]  It's, you know, heartening to see.
[00:36:23.972 --> 00:36:26.453]  And this is the right country for it to happen in.
[00:36:26.453 --> 00:36:27.393]  They don't belong here.
[00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:30.654]  As I said, it's retrograde to what they believe.
[00:36:30.654 --> 00:36:32.934]  And, you know, they're in the wrong environment.
[00:36:32.934 --> 00:36:42.237]  And it provides the right opportunity to present them with the right rebuke, the right defense of the common man.
[00:36:42.237 --> 00:36:44.417]  And it's time for the common man to win a few.
[00:36:44.417 --> 00:36:46.198]  You know, they've had their day in the sun.
[00:36:46.198 --> 00:36:47.478]  It's time for them to pack it in.
[00:36:48.726 --> 00:36:52.007]  Any other key points you'd like to add about what you've observed, editor?
[00:36:52.007 --> 00:36:54.628]  I know you work as a visiting editor and a lot of other things.
[00:36:54.628 --> 00:36:56.668]  In fact, what is your title in American Free Press?
[00:36:56.668 --> 00:36:59.489]  I know you're a radio talk show host, too, and I've interviewed you many times.
[00:36:59.489 --> 00:37:01.629]  Mark, what's your title over there?
[00:37:01.629 --> 00:37:02.490]  I'm editor.
[00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.610]  Jim Tucker's editor emeritus.
[00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.511]  He's semi-retired, but he still covers Bilderberg.
[00:37:07.511 --> 00:37:09.511]  And I'm editor, and we're a team now.
[00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:12.072]  I'm sort of inheriting the baton from him, more or less.
[00:37:13.785 --> 00:37:30.952]  Well, I think that what we're talking about today is the key development, and what I talked about earlier where the legislator who's rebuking and confronting Bilderberg tried to get the local and federal police from stopping Bilderberg from meeting here in the first place.
[00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:41.736]  But maybe it's almost better that didn't happen, because if that didn't happen, or if that would have happened had they not met here, then he wouldn't be evidently approaching them and confronting them with this letter.
[00:37:42.256 --> 00:37:45.558]  So maybe this is the way God intended it, you know?
[00:37:45.558 --> 00:37:56.423]  And certainly, I think that these specific issues that Bilderberg wants to discuss include whether to continue the wars in Afghanistan and Libya.
[00:37:56.423 --> 00:38:01.506]  It always includes energy matters, monetary matters, you know, will the
[00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:13.247]  I'm sure that meeting in Switzerland, they're going to think about Switzerland being this odd man out and not fitting into their global straitjacket.
[00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:23.032]  Everything is a lot less secret about Bilderberg than it used to be, but it's still hard to discern, of course, unless you're in there, exactly what they're talking about.
[00:38:23.032 --> 00:38:29.315]  They do have a quasi-official website where they list a quasi-official set of topics.
[00:38:29.969 --> 00:38:31.630]  But, you know, they're very misleading.
[00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:39.434]  There's one in there right now on their official website, something like, Switzerland, uh, you know, will it be successful in the future?
[00:38:39.434 --> 00:38:44.857]  You know, you could read that a lot of different ways, you know, real innocuous-sounding topics.
[00:38:44.857 --> 00:38:51.721]  And so, it always sounds dry and academic, you know, if you read their own literature.
[00:38:51.721 --> 00:38:56.044]  But of course, there's much more to it, and the secrecy is the enduring problem.
[00:38:56.044 --> 00:38:56.144]  So.
[00:38:58.806 --> 00:39:01.768]  That's essentially what we've got so far.
[00:39:01.768 --> 00:39:05.430]  And the rest is just a lot of legwork confirming who's there.
[00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.852]  Okay.
[00:39:08.852 --> 00:39:13.395]  Mark Anderson, we've got Jim Tucker on the line with us.
[00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:15.556]  We're going to let you go.
[00:39:15.556 --> 00:39:20.720]  But stay close to my guys because I want to get you to pop in coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.120]  But Mark, thank you so much.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.302]  We'll continue to watch your work at AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:39:24.302 --> 00:39:25.563]  Thank you, sir.
[00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.123]  You're welcome.
[00:39:26.123 --> 00:39:27.083]  Pass the baton to Jim.
[00:39:27.083 --> 00:39:27.664]  We'll see you, Alex.
[00:39:28.163 --> 00:39:29.563]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[00:39:29.563 --> 00:39:33.004]  Here is Jim Tucker, the original Bilderberg sleuth.
[00:39:33.004 --> 00:39:34.224]  Jim, good to have you here with us.
[00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:36.765]  It's always a pleasure.
[00:39:36.765 --> 00:39:57.550]  Jim, how big is this that this top Swiss leader has sent the letter demanding that Kissinger basically be arrested and that the police follow the Swiss Constitution and honor the press and that he is now in the next few hours preparing to make his way there to try to basically force his way into the Bilderberg group meeting?
[00:40:00.506 --> 00:40:08.855]  Well, several people saw such a vehicle approach.
[00:40:08.855 --> 00:40:11.077]  On the other hand, there are several ways they have done it.
[00:40:11.077 --> 00:40:19.106]  They could have taken the ambulance from the airplane to a car park somewhere else and slid in that way.
[00:40:19.106 --> 00:40:21.389]  But the particular is definitely there.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.600]  Yes.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.901]  He's the heart of Bilderberg along with Rockefeller and Queen Beatrix.
[00:40:27.901 --> 00:40:39.125]  What do you make of the announcement that this leader of a canton, I mean as high level as it gets, other than the Prime Minister of Switzerland, is going to confront them, Jim?
[00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:42.026]  Have you heard this news?
[00:40:42.026 --> 00:40:42.766]  Yes, Eric.
[00:40:42.766 --> 00:40:45.447]  It's been reported that he plans a confrontation.
[00:40:45.447 --> 00:40:48.488]  It should be a lot of fun, too.
[00:40:50.962 --> 00:40:57.709]  I guess we'll have to stay outside the gates until they come out because I've had it sealed off inside.
[00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:04.697]  And they could throw him in jail if he bucks the line.
[00:41:04.697 --> 00:41:06.819]  In fact, they have jailed a couple of people already.
[00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:09.682]  They tried to walk through against orders.
[00:41:09.682 --> 00:41:11.624]  Took one guy's passport away.
[00:41:11.624 --> 00:41:12.786]  They're playing rough.
[00:41:13.897 --> 00:41:15.318]  Yes, I'd be analogous to that, certainly.
[00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:34.888]  Oh, this is huge.
[00:41:34.888 --> 00:41:39.952]  Have you ever seen anything like this in your 35 years of covering the Bilderberg scum?
[00:41:39.952 --> 00:41:48.638]  Never, never has Ohio State been so publicly challenged Bilderberg.
[00:41:48.638 --> 00:41:56.444]  I tell you, this is... If they were running scared earlier in the week, Jim, you know they've heard of this.
[00:41:56.444 --> 00:41:59.447]  Do you think they're doing you know what in their underwear?
[00:42:00.882 --> 00:42:03.264]  Oh yes, I'm sure they have battle problems.
[00:42:03.264 --> 00:42:11.229]  The starting lady, way to cause the crowd cover, keeping the helicopters away.
[00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:18.755]  Not all helicopters get to St.
[00:42:18.755 --> 00:42:19.855]  Marie.
[00:42:19.855 --> 00:42:29.122]  So they had to do a lot of long distance driving and some planes were able to land at the small airport later.
[00:42:31.112 --> 00:42:34.913]  They were a full day late getting started.
[00:42:34.913 --> 00:42:43.054]  And they all have to duck and run on Monday because their cover meetings.
[00:42:43.054 --> 00:42:51.156]  NATO is one cover meeting, as you know, and that way the Secretary of Defense can duck into Bilderberg and then go home.
[00:42:51.156 --> 00:42:56.337]  The reason he was over here was NATO and no word mentioned about the Bilderberg meeting, of course.
[00:43:01.661 --> 00:43:05.685]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:05.685 --> 00:43:08.909]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:13.714]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:43:13.714 --> 00:43:20.101]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:43:20.101 --> 00:43:22.364]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:23.184]  Tim Geithner?
[00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:23.705]  Bernanke?
[00:43:23.705 --> 00:43:24.485]  They're arsonists!
[00:43:24.485 --> 00:43:25.646]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:27.887]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:43:41.775 --> 00:43:49.057]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:44:00.168 --> 00:44:04.711]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:44:04.711 --> 00:44:05.631]  Number 1.
[00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:09.054]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:44:09.054 --> 00:44:09.914]  Number 2.
[00:44:09.914 --> 00:44:14.797]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:44:14.797 --> 00:44:15.558]  It's true.
[00:44:15.558 --> 00:44:20.421]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:44:20.421 --> 00:44:21.241]  Number 3.
[00:44:21.241 --> 00:44:24.844]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:28.546]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:29.527]  Number 4.
[00:44:29.527 --> 00:44:32.289]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:35.972]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:44:35.972 --> 00:44:36.772]  Number 5.
[00:44:36.772 --> 00:44:40.915]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:44:40.915 --> 00:44:45.679]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:46:03.905 --> 00:46:05.165]  Tyranny is here.
[00:46:05.165 --> 00:46:08.827]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:46:08.827 --> 00:46:11.329]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:17.192]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:46:17.192 --> 00:46:23.415]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:46:23.835 --> 00:46:29.798]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:46:29.798 --> 00:46:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.303]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:46:38.303 --> 00:46:44.246]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:46:44.246 --> 00:46:47.788]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:46:47.788 --> 00:46:49.769]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:46:49.769 --> 00:46:50.209]  It's here.

[00:47:02.796 --> 00:47:04.858]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:04.858 --> 00:47:10.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:10.241 --> 00:47:15.664]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.664 --> 00:47:17.905]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:26.770]  Well, this is an historical broadcast.
[00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:32.011]  We're talking to a member of the Swiss Parliament right now, Lucas Reimann.
[00:47:32.011 --> 00:47:36.873]  Other members of the Parliament are soon to arrive.
[00:47:36.873 --> 00:47:43.475]  This is just incredible, and we're talking about the different party leaders that are arriving, who stand against the Globalists, the IMF, the World Bank.
[00:47:43.775 --> 00:47:44.175]  Take a look.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.250]  I'm very sorry, I couldn't understand you.
[00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.111]  They were here already talking.
[00:48:34.887 --> 00:48:41.490]  Yeah, we oppose the Bilderberg Group because we think in a democracy people should decide.
[00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:45.832]  You know in Switzerland people can decide about every decision by a vote.
[00:48:45.832 --> 00:48:49.914]  People vote yes or no and not a few people.
[00:48:49.914 --> 00:48:56.196]  The most rich people, the most important people, they can decide about the people.
[00:48:56.196 --> 00:48:59.858]  We think it should come from the people.
[00:48:59.858 --> 00:49:04.340]  We want freedom for the people and not this Bilderberg thing.
[00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:10.860]  Now, before we went to break, you were talking about opposing the IMF World Bank.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:20.285]  Can you explain to people what those systems are doing, what the Euro is doing, and why the Swiss are standing against it?
[00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:24.508]  Yeah, we did a lot of work in the Parliament against the IMF.
[00:49:24.508 --> 00:49:29.350]  You know, Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, it's not a member of the Euro.
[00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:35.494]  We also tried to get out Switzerland of the IMF, to stop this system that wants
[00:49:37.053 --> 00:49:41.623]  It's a slavery of the currencies and we have to stop that.
[00:49:41.623 --> 00:49:44.009]  We want freedom also for the currencies.
[00:49:46.946 --> 00:50:07.990]  What can you tell us about the plans that we've been told of today for the man you called your leader and please again tell us about his position in Swiss government in the parliament who's coming and who wrote the letter and is planning reportedly to go in March up to the gates of Bilderberg and reportedly demand to be let in?
[00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:14.775]  He tried to stop the Bilderberg Conference before it began.
[00:50:14.775 --> 00:50:21.380]  He wrote to our government, he wrote to the president here from St.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.023]  Moritz, and he tried to stop the conference.
[00:50:25.023 --> 00:50:34.330]  He said a non-democratic, intransparent thing like that should not be here in Switzerland.
[00:50:36.334 --> 00:50:39.495]  And some folks will say, what, free association isn't allowed?
[00:50:39.495 --> 00:50:41.036]  These are government ministers.
[00:50:41.036 --> 00:50:45.097]  You have laws there against government people meeting with other governments.
[00:50:45.097 --> 00:50:48.979]  That's called treason, to discuss things outside the purview of the people and make deals.
[00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:53.660]  Hillary Clinton has been previously fined for attending Bilderberg under our Logan Act.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:51:00.863]  What is the specific law, because I know Switzerland has one, sir, against government meetings in secret with private interest?
[00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:15.517]  Oh yes, we have this law and I think we, our churches have to use that against the conference.
[00:51:15.517 --> 00:51:19.480]  Now we're able to watch you live here, streaming video.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.244]  Who is that fellow standing next to you, a member of parliament, Lucas Reimann?
[00:51:25.618 --> 00:51:45.512]  It's Dominic, he's just helping me because my English is not very good but what I can say is that here are some members of the National Parliament in Switzerland and they do support you, they do support Ron Paul and they hope it will change a lot in the world in the next year.
[00:51:45.512 --> 00:51:47.874]  Yes sir, I thought I recognized him.
[00:51:47.874 --> 00:51:50.595]  That's the fellow that helped write the original letters to get things going.
[00:51:50.595 --> 00:51:52.857]  We interviewed Dominic earlier.
[00:51:54.659 --> 00:51:57.521]  Are there any other members of parliament there yet?
[00:51:57.521 --> 00:51:58.942]  Or do you know when they're arriving?
[00:51:58.942 --> 00:52:09.309]  Do you know when the leader of the pro-Swiss independence, Mr. Dominic, do you know when he's going to arrive?
[00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:12.130]  He will arrive at 8 o'clock here in St.
[00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:12.871]  Moritz.
[00:52:12.871 --> 00:52:14.392]  So he's arriving in about 30 minutes?
[00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:18.334]  European time.
[00:52:18.334 --> 00:52:19.035]  30 minutes, yes.
[00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:20.196]  We try our best.
[00:52:20.196 --> 00:52:23.339]  I can call him and ask if he could arrive a little bit earlier.
[00:52:40.618 --> 00:52:41.278]  Oh no, that's fine.
[00:52:41.278 --> 00:52:43.699]  We're going to be going into the next hour, sir.
[00:52:43.699 --> 00:52:56.644]  So we're going to let you go, but after you have anything else you'd like to add, and then we'll obviously get your phone number, and then we're going to follow you around so that we can have full coverage of what's happening.
[00:52:56.644 --> 00:53:00.226]  Okay, thank you so much for your work and good luck for the future.
[00:53:00.984 --> 00:53:01.664]  Thank you so much.
[00:53:01.664 --> 00:53:03.405]  Please give the phone back to Paul Watson.
[00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:04.266]  Jaron, talk to Paul.
[00:53:04.266 --> 00:53:05.026]  Give him the direction.
[00:53:05.026 --> 00:53:05.846]  Thank you.
[00:53:05.846 --> 00:53:06.226]  All right.
[00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:07.587]  This is unbelievable.
[00:53:07.587 --> 00:53:15.071]  This is what real media, real cutting edge, real new network, next generation info war is about.
[00:53:15.071 --> 00:53:17.692]  We are watching live video from Switzerland.
[00:53:17.692 --> 00:53:21.694]  If you're a prison planet dot TV member, the radio listeners are listening to this.
[00:53:21.694 --> 00:53:23.194]  This is all happening live time.
[00:53:23.194 --> 00:53:24.355]  And I'm the director of this.
[00:53:24.355 --> 00:53:25.936]  So I am here on air.
[00:53:26.956 --> 00:53:42.272]  From Austin, Texas, directing great patriots and media people there in their coverage of what's happening and talking to folks, along with the rest of the crew, helping in this symphony to bring you this information.
[00:53:42.272 --> 00:53:43.553]  Great job to the crew.
[00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:46.837]  I am absolutely blown away by the coverage today.
[00:53:46.837 --> 00:53:48.178]  I would imagine you are.
[00:53:48.178 --> 00:53:49.279]  This is so exciting.
[00:53:51.263 --> 00:53:59.414]  You know, I only did this one time on air about two years ago because it's such a big deal to my family and your family and everybody else who loves freedom.
[00:53:59.414 --> 00:54:00.836]  Anybody that doesn't want to be a slave.
[00:54:00.836 --> 00:54:02.478]  The globalists control the oil.
[00:54:02.478 --> 00:54:03.519]  They control the carbon.
[00:54:03.519 --> 00:54:05.542]  They've designed a carbon-based system.
[00:54:06.323 --> 00:54:06.383]  We
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:49.816]  System and when it came out with the emails and the premeditated lies and the fact that they know carbon is good And more carbon dioxide is good that the temperature is actually Started dropping overall they can always show you some micro temperature increases But I can show you decreases the point is I had the guys go get champagne and pop it on air And I've obviously got a long trip ahead of me and a lot of work to do today, so I'm not gonna do that I'm not a big drinker, but let me tell you tonight in New York
[00:54:51.081 --> 00:55:02.290]  I'm gonna go out to dinner with, tomorrow night, Gerald Salente, but with Ted Anderson, you better believe, I don't even like champagne that much, there's gonna be a bottle of expensive champagne being drunk.
[00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.593]  Because, I mean, this is awesome.
[00:55:05.593 --> 00:55:13.359]  And we are about to see something that is so off the charts, just absolutely fantastic.
[00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:17.702]  I am beside myself right now with glee.
[00:55:19.263 --> 00:55:29.688]  The huge dam breaking, Drudge Report, Newsweek, Time, BBC, London Guardian, hundreds of other papers, Bilderberg, World Government, what are they talking about in there?
[00:55:29.688 --> 00:55:37.771]  We've got the moles inside, we've got the intel, we've got live video, and now three prominent, one of them is like...
[00:55:38.231 --> 00:55:39.653]  I was looking him up the last few weeks.
[00:55:39.653 --> 00:55:41.195]  I read about him years ago.
[00:55:41.195 --> 00:55:42.957]  He's bigger than Ron Paul in Switzerland.
[00:55:42.957 --> 00:55:45.160]  I mean, the Ron Paul of Switzerland.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.842]  Very high level in the Parliament.
[00:55:46.842 --> 00:55:48.564]  Right up beneath the Prime Minister.
[00:55:48.564 --> 00:55:50.948]  He is marching on Bilderberg today.
[00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:52.189]  The Prime Minister came out.
[00:55:52.189 --> 00:55:53.110]  It was in Swiss papers.
[00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:54.732]  We did screenshots of those.
[00:55:54.732 --> 00:55:55.994]  Put them on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:56.795 --> 00:55:56.975]  I don't
[00:56:19.238 --> 00:56:27.125]  It's like Bank of America thinking they can take houses without even having any type of deed or somebody buys the house in cash.
[00:56:27.125 --> 00:56:28.967]  They have no history, no claim.
[00:56:28.967 --> 00:56:29.688]  They come and take it.
[00:56:29.688 --> 00:56:31.689]  The court says, well, it's five months later.
[00:56:31.689 --> 00:56:32.730]  We said give them their house back.
[00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:33.551]  You haven't.
[00:56:33.551 --> 00:56:39.717]  So we're going to send deputies to seize your bank and take the cash out and pay them on the barrelhead.
[00:56:40.899 --> 00:56:42.181]  That's the people's court!
[00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:43.182]  That's America!
[00:56:43.182 --> 00:56:44.084]  That's Switzerland!
[00:56:44.084 --> 00:56:45.265]  That's what the Dutch had!
[00:56:45.265 --> 00:56:46.247]  That's real freedom!
[00:56:46.247 --> 00:56:48.350]  Nobody else ever had what the Swiss have had!
[00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:50.533]  Nobody ever had what people in America had!
[00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:52.315]  Nobody ever had what the Dutch had!
[00:56:52.315 --> 00:56:53.517]  And they're taking it away!
[00:56:54.508 --> 00:56:57.552]  It's a lie that our system came from the Greeks and the Romans.
[00:56:57.552 --> 00:56:59.494]  There's a little bit of that in there.
[00:56:59.494 --> 00:57:00.695]  It's Swiss.
[00:57:00.695 --> 00:57:04.219]  And people better get that through their head.
[00:57:04.219 --> 00:57:11.868]  The Swiss are all given automatic weapons and hand grenades, and then they have yearly searches in the house to make sure the guns are hidden.
[00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:18.388]  To make sure if a foreign government comes in, your guns are so hidden, our own gun finders can't find them.
[00:57:18.388 --> 00:57:20.089]  I mean, that's what it's all about.
[00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:28.075]  People are like, well, one of the freest groups, the richest group, lowest crime rate in the world, automatic weapons, hand grenades, grenade launchers.
[00:57:28.075 --> 00:57:30.977]  The crime rate is non-existent.
[00:57:30.977 --> 00:57:32.618]  And I'm telling you, that's why it's happening there.
[00:57:50.888 --> 00:57:57.532]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:57:57.532 --> 00:58:02.676]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:58:02.676 --> 00:58:11.402]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:58:11.402 --> 00:58:15.484]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:58:15.484 --> 00:58:17.786]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:58:19.895 --> 00:58:24.497]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:58:24.497 --> 00:58:28.339]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:29.560]  Others don't.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.701]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:58:31.701 --> 00:58:33.482]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:58:33.482 --> 00:58:36.383]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:58:36.383 --> 00:58:43.007]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:58:43.007 --> 00:58:45.708]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:48.069]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.870]  Others don't.
[00:58:50.046 --> 00:58:54.609]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:54.609 --> 00:58:55.509]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.509 --> 00:58:58.932]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:58.932 --> 00:58:59.792]  Number 2.
[00:58:59.792 --> 00:59:04.695]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.695 --> 00:59:05.436]  It's true.
[00:59:05.436 --> 00:59:10.299]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.299 --> 00:59:11.139]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.139 --> 00:59:14.722]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:14.722 --> 00:59:18.424]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.624 --> 00:59:19.424]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.424 --> 00:59:22.185]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.185 --> 00:59:25.846]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:25.846 --> 00:59:26.646]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:30.787]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:30.787 --> 00:59:35.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:35.849 --> 00:59:40.030]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:59:54.827 --> 00:59:58.053]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:09.378 --> 01:00:19.422]  Okay, so the big fat parasites, the social vampires, the economic ringwraiths, the Nosferatus, are perched in St.
[01:00:19.422 --> 01:00:24.645]  Mort, Switzerland right now, going to great lengths to not be seen, engaged in their skullduggery.
[01:00:25.305 --> 01:00:29.088]  As they plan the next country they're going to bring down and the next war they're going to launch.
[01:00:29.088 --> 01:00:32.811]  And we're taking your calls right now ahead of a bunch of other key news.
[01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:35.614]  Matt in England and Joseph in Germany, Paul in Ireland.
[01:00:35.614 --> 01:00:37.395]  The toll-free number to join us from Europe, 800-259-9231.
[01:00:37.395 --> 01:00:38.796]  Matt in England, you're on the air.
[01:00:38.796 --> 01:00:39.517]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:44.258 --> 01:00:45.359]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:45.359 --> 01:00:50.342]  I just want to say, first of all, to all UK Info Warriors that are listening to your show now, get to St.
[01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:58.047]  Moritz, get there as fast as you can, if you can, borrow the money, and get there and shout out, because this affects this country as well.
[01:00:58.047 --> 01:01:09.754]  I mean, Alex, you've covered a lot of things, I've just been listening to your sensational outburst there, mentioning the agendas that affect us all, really, all over the world, you know, higher interest rates, I reckon that that's their policies, that they're going to
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:18.986]  Oh yeah, the CFR has called for more geoengineering.
[01:01:18.986 --> 01:01:20.928]  They publicly admit they're chemtrailing.
[01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:22.550]  Then if you tell the public, they laugh at you.
[01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:24.411]  They're changing the atmosphere.
[01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:33.280]  And over 70 percent, Monckton says it's 87 percent now, of your laws are made by the unelected EU board, controlled and chaired by Bilderberg minions.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:40.731]  I mean, Rumpy and Barroso are there right now getting their orders from the sinister royalty.
[01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.874]  This is so disgusting.
[01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:45.879]  So, go face down the real enemy peacefully.
[01:01:45.879 --> 01:01:46.961]  Draw attention to them.
[01:01:48.979 --> 01:01:57.222]  I mean, also, um, you know, I think the other agenda that they're going to enforce is more rising gas and petrol.
[01:01:57.222 --> 01:01:58.582]  Petrol over gas in America.
[01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:11.006]  Another thing is, I don't know if you've seen the video on YouTube, there's a video going out from the BBC, or this info goon, obviously from the BBC, did the interview, where he mentions truth as it's mentally unstable.
[01:02:11.006 --> 01:02:13.687]  I don't know if it's in the video or not.
[01:02:13.687 --> 01:02:14.888]  Uh, who is that?
[01:02:14.888 --> 01:02:15.488]  What's his name?
[01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.391]  I don't know who it is, it's just been sent in about maybe half an hour ago.
[01:02:20.391 --> 01:02:32.017]  I haven't really watched all the way through it, but basically, there's an interview from the BBC and this guy, sounds like a big disinfo goon, basically mentioned that all people believe 9-11's inside job are mentally unstable.
[01:02:32.901 --> 01:02:33.982]  Well, that's what they're saying.
[01:02:33.982 --> 01:02:36.504]  If you don't believe in global warming, you should be arrested.
[01:02:36.504 --> 01:02:39.006]  That's openly called for in the British Parliament now.
[01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.027]  Very, very dangerous.
[01:02:40.027 --> 01:02:40.868]  These are tyrants.
[01:02:40.868 --> 01:02:42.289]  Thank you so much, Matt.
[01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:50.196]  Yeah, if you don't believe Wiener when he blamed Andrew Breitbart for making up the photo and hacking his site, turns out it was a total lie.
[01:02:50.196 --> 01:02:53.619]  But still, you gotta believe Wiener or you're mentally ill.
[01:02:53.619 --> 01:02:56.161]  In fact, I'm gonna be establishment.
[01:02:56.161 --> 01:02:57.302]  Wiener told the truth.
[01:02:57.302 --> 01:02:58.283]  Breitbart is bad.
[01:02:59.201 --> 01:03:00.582]  And Bill Clinton didn't lie.
[01:03:00.582 --> 01:03:01.643]  That's right.
[01:03:01.643 --> 01:03:03.984]  We're supposed to believe what they say.
[01:03:03.984 --> 01:03:05.165]  Josef in Germany.
[01:03:05.165 --> 01:03:05.905]  You're on the air.
[01:03:05.905 --> 01:03:08.607]  Welcome from Deutschland.
[01:03:08.607 --> 01:03:10.428]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[01:03:10.428 --> 01:03:12.590]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:15.051]  I want to say the people from Germany are awake.
[01:03:15.051 --> 01:03:17.973]  There are awake people here in Germany.
[01:03:17.973 --> 01:03:21.035]  And we are going to the Bilderberg meeting.
[01:03:21.035 --> 01:03:24.498]  And if anyone wants to join us, we're a group.
[01:03:24.498 --> 01:03:25.378]  You can just eat.
[01:03:25.378 --> 01:03:25.518]  Hello?
[01:03:25.518 --> 01:03:26.179]  Do you hear me?
[01:03:26.179 --> 01:03:26.499]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:27.860]  I'm listening to you.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.020]  Yeah.
[01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:45.952]  There's a group of us going if you want to join us just mail email at Bilderberg 2011 at googlemail.com else I have some information they have been hyping another false flag terror attack here in Germany the 26th
[01:03:49.881 --> 01:04:04.412]  Yeah, they hype up that every event's gonna be struck so they have an excuse to stick their hands down your pants and train you for concentration camp living.
[01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:07.054]  You know, Germany per capita has paid even more money than the U.S.
[01:04:07.955 --> 01:04:16.919]  to these private bankers as bailouts, and now Obama is trying to order Merkel to give even more of your tax money to the bankers in the name of saving the EU.
[01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:25.904]  And I've seen polls of over 80% of Germans are outraged by this, and Merkel almost lost her seat in the last parliamentary run.
[01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:30.266]  What are the Germans' average view of these banker Nosferatus?
[01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:53.668]  Well, the Germans are very upset, as you said, and the Germans feel like the German government is just like the horse pushing and working for the whole of Europe, paying for Spain, paying for Greece, paying for everyone, and people honestly don't like it.
[01:05:00.202 --> 01:05:01.903]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.903 --> 01:05:07.225]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:07.225 --> 01:05:08.745]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:08.745 --> 01:05:17.549]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:33.813]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:33.813 --> 01:05:39.035]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:06:09.578 --> 01:06:11.179]  You want answers?
[01:06:11.179 --> 01:06:12.720]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.923]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:16.923 --> 01:06:21.006]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:30.776]  We are now eight minutes into hour number two of this worldwide transmission.
[01:06:30.776 --> 01:06:38.625]  I want to give the number out for Europeans, people going under the debt austerity of the banksters who on record
[01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:59.884]  Our own government admits engaged in crimes creating 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives and now we've got to quote bail them out and have them make record profits or they threaten to implode the rest of our economy because like Siamese twins they have woven all of our currency and our infrastructure and our investments into their system and they're holding us hostage.
[01:06:59.884 --> 01:07:02.025]  The issue is though they want austerity.
[01:07:02.025 --> 01:07:05.348]  They want to make us poor so we can be politically controlled.
[01:07:05.348 --> 01:07:06.969]  Bilderberg has admitted that.
[01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:10.011]  These globalists use poverty as a tool.
[01:07:10.011 --> 01:07:21.118]  So if you give in to their hostage-taking economically, if you give in to their economic terrorism, they then just bring you step-by-step into deeper and deeper bondage.
[01:07:21.118 --> 01:07:27.222]  So all we can do is say, go ahead, give us the depression, slam everything down, we're gonna arrest every single one of you.
[01:07:27.842 --> 01:07:36.729]  Believe me, if our government started doing the right thing and indicting these people, even Rolling Stone two weeks ago said the Senate committee has found total crime by these big mega banks.
[01:07:36.729 --> 01:07:38.070]  Where are the indictments?
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:39.271]  Where are they?
[01:07:39.271 --> 01:07:41.093]  Arrest them all.
[01:07:41.093 --> 01:07:42.494]  It's us or them.
[01:07:42.494 --> 01:07:45.597]  They own both major parties in every major country.
[01:07:45.597 --> 01:07:47.058]  It's us or them.
[01:07:47.058 --> 01:07:48.639]  Their crimes are legion.
[01:07:48.639 --> 01:07:49.820]  Their crimes are open.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.601]  And now Obama.
[01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:56.097]  He's saying, oh, Germany and others don't want to give trillions more, but America is.
[01:07:56.097 --> 01:07:58.520]  They don't want to give trillions more to the bankers.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.002]  It's not really a banker bailout.
[01:08:00.002 --> 01:08:03.848]  It's giving it to them, or they'll hold Europe hostage and suck us down with it.
[01:08:03.848 --> 01:08:04.569]  And he's saying he's...
[01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:14.191]  Pressing Europe to pony up along with the US with more tax money that goes directly to these mega banks that engineered all this.
[01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:18.374]  And his entire administration is Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[01:08:18.374 --> 01:08:20.836]  The entire stinking thing.
[01:08:20.836 --> 01:08:22.217]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:08:22.217 --> 01:08:26.280]  And they own Romney of Romneycare, the model for Obamacare.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.822]  A lot of Republicans don't care.
[01:08:28.786 --> 01:08:29.266]  You know what?
[01:08:58.826 --> 01:09:09.415]  And we've broken the electronic Berlin Wall, the news blackout on Bilderberg 2011, the top two reports on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:09:09.415 --> 01:09:22.407]  Bombscare shuts down road to Bilderberg meeting, and they use that as a foil to basically shut things down so we couldn't get video of their faces, but not before we got the head of NATO, Bill Gates, and others.
[01:09:23.067 --> 01:09:25.388]  Also, secret agenda leaked by Mole.
[01:09:25.388 --> 01:09:28.410]  I want to go over some of that secret agenda later in the hour.
[01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:30.471]  That's really our biggest news.
[01:09:30.471 --> 01:09:33.012]  And of course, we're calling for a giant protest.
[01:09:33.012 --> 01:09:37.595]  People all over Europe have come out in the millions against tyranny and the austerity.
[01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:44.598]  These are the people that did it with the 40-something percent unemployment in many European countries now and people under 30.
[01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:47.680]  The 20-plus percent unemployment in the general public.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.740]  These are the people.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.521]  These are the people that
[01:09:49.781 --> 01:09:53.904]  Raise your taxes, where the average European pays over 70% in taxes.
[01:09:53.904 --> 01:10:06.613]  These are the people that openly have their banking heads, the treasury heads, the exchequer of England, all of them, former heads like Alan Greenspan, all out saying, we need to raise your taxes.
[01:10:06.613 --> 01:10:13.839]  Warren Buffett, who got hundreds of billions of your bailout money, your money, he says raise taxes on the rich.
[01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:15.280]  Meanwhile, he's exempt from it.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:19.083]  Fortune 500 pay on average 2.4% taxes.
[01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:19.944]  They're globalists.
[01:10:19.944 --> 01:10:21.065]  They're international.
[01:10:21.065 --> 01:10:23.828]  They've exempted themselves from the law.
[01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:25.230]  Oh, we need to help the poor.
[01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.971]  Remember the carbon tax two years ago?
[01:10:26.971 --> 01:10:29.114]  In Copenhagen, the treaty got leaked.
[01:10:29.114 --> 01:10:32.016]  They wouldn't release the treaty, but the third world countries leaked the treaty.
[01:10:32.756 --> 01:10:32.956]  I don't
[01:10:54.170 --> 01:11:03.157]  Fat Americans who are greedy and have a high standard of living and boy they bellied up to the bar and said you bet we're ready to sign this and they got the treaty and they said what?
[01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.195]  And the bankers want to kill the third world.
[01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:10.079]  They're a bunch of eugenicists who openly write books calling black people animals.
[01:11:10.079 --> 01:11:12.441]  Of course they want to cut off all your energy.
[01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:17.045]  It's always been the globalist western plan by the elites to stop development of the third world.
[01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:24.052]  That's in the British 1949 Royal Commission on Population, where they said, if we industrialize the third world, they will not overpopulate.
[01:11:24.552 --> 01:11:25.653]  from their perspective.
[01:11:25.653 --> 01:11:29.976]  They will then though be rivals to us and we won't have hegemonic control.
[01:11:29.976 --> 01:11:37.542]  Instead we'll keep them in the dark ages, in the stone ages, but it will make them then have giant populations because poor people have more kids on average.
[01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:38.543]  So how do we deal with that?
[01:11:38.543 --> 01:11:51.253]  Well then we come in behind that with Planned Parenthood and sterilizations and forced abortions and pay India and pay Peru and pay African countries on record to forcefully grab women and sterilize them.
[01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:56.371]  We're going to keep you poor, not let you industrialize and do our best to kill you.
[01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:59.232]  Keep you from having babies.
[01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:01.853]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:12:01.853 --> 01:12:04.194]  They are sick and they are the enemies of humanity.
[01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:08.256]  So if you want to do something historical, people are like, oh, it won't do anything.
[01:12:08.256 --> 01:12:08.956]  Oh, yes, it will.
[01:12:08.956 --> 01:12:10.397]  Look how far we've come.
[01:12:10.397 --> 01:12:17.900]  As I told you 10 years ago, we're pushing and pushing and making Bilderberg come out in mainstream news to identify the real global controllers of this planet.
[01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:21.521]  The real global controllers of this planet.
[01:12:21.521 --> 01:12:31.307]  Once you identify them, then you're not looking at Obama or Bush or Perry or Sarkozy or Barroso.
[01:12:31.307 --> 01:12:36.870]  You're looking at the real owners, those 10 to 8 families.
[01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:42.534]  You can debate, but we've written and posted a detailed analysis at InfoWars.com of the 8 ruling families.
[01:12:42.534 --> 01:12:43.975]  It's in the Four Horsemen
[01:12:45.718 --> 01:12:46.199]  I don't
[01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:02.943]  That's why they're shutting down the road.
[01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:13.632]  That's why you heard from inside Bilderberg sources, Rupert Murdoch was asked by Bilderberg to please talk to all the newspaper and media people he knows and ask them not to cover this here in the US.
[01:13:13.632 --> 01:13:26.583]  But they have to cover it because we're covering it and the Drudge Report's covering it and now it's one of the biggest news items in the world and it's only going to get bigger when you in Europe, who are a few hours away, hop a train and get in there
[01:13:26.843 --> 01:13:31.064]  And all you gotta do is sit there and chant, down with tyranny, down with Bilderberg.
[01:13:31.064 --> 01:13:36.265]  And as you're driving on your cell phone, in your car, on the train, call local media and tell them to be there.
[01:13:36.265 --> 01:13:40.986]  And it's gonna be an absolute fiasco for the Bilderberg group.
[01:13:40.986 --> 01:13:42.086]  What did Brzezinski say last year?
[01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:46.787]  He says, for the first time in human history, humanity is awake and staring.
[01:13:46.787 --> 01:13:50.188]  No longer are they able to be manipulated politically.
[01:13:50.188 --> 01:13:51.688]  They understand the ruling class.
[01:13:53.629 --> 01:14:05.797]  The Federal Reserve, just five, six years ago, maybe 5% of Americans knew it was private, knew it was a big scam, was bankrupting our country for a dollar to be created, a dollar of debt is created and given to them out of nothing.
[01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:06.778]  They knew this.
[01:14:06.778 --> 01:14:09.820]  They understood this.
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.882]  And now, I've seen the Gallup polls.
[01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:16.605]  Three years ago, when Ron Paul was exposing it on the national platform, being demonized, it was upwards of 75%.
[01:14:18.484 --> 01:14:19.904]  A year ago it was 80%.
[01:14:19.904 --> 01:14:28.046]  I've seen major scientific polls, 85 and higher, of Americans want to abolish the Fed, audit the Fed, and know they're the enemy.
[01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:31.207]  And the bankers are going, oops, they're not looking at our marionettes.
[01:14:31.207 --> 01:14:33.028]  Remember the old Bill Hicks line?
[01:14:33.028 --> 01:14:35.288]  Hey, I like the puppet on the left.
[01:14:35.288 --> 01:14:37.409]  Hey, I like the puppet on the right.
[01:14:37.409 --> 01:14:43.770]  And one guy goes, hey, there's one guy holding both puppets.
[01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:46.531]  When humanity reaches that point, and it has,
[01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:50.213]  But everyone still feels like we're alone.
[01:14:50.213 --> 01:14:51.334]  We're the minority.
[01:14:51.334 --> 01:14:52.556]  No, we're not.
[01:14:52.556 --> 01:14:53.197]  No, we're not.
[01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:54.659]  You aren't public figures.
[01:14:54.659 --> 01:14:55.761]  You aren't known.
[01:14:55.761 --> 01:14:56.902]  You aren't recognized.
[01:14:58.138 --> 01:15:00.941]  I cannot walk down the street anywhere.
[01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:02.562]  I cannot go in a 7-Eleven.
[01:15:02.562 --> 01:15:03.943]  I cannot go to a shopping mall.
[01:15:03.943 --> 01:15:05.404]  I cannot go to a Target.
[01:15:05.404 --> 01:15:06.665]  I cannot go anywhere.
[01:15:06.665 --> 01:15:09.828]  Years ago, I'd walk by 50 people and two groups would stop.
[01:15:09.828 --> 01:15:20.196]  Now, I walk by a group of 50 people, I get mobbed, and I can't even get out of there because they all want to take photos and shake my hand, and then it builds up because people have that, you know, thing that they're kind of scared to get outside their bubble.
[01:15:20.196 --> 01:15:22.999]  But once they see people talking to me, then they come over, then they come over.
[01:15:22.999 --> 01:15:24.280]  And it's great to talk to you.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]  I've just got somewhere to go.
[01:15:26.161 --> 01:15:28.685]  Again, I'm not bragging, oh look, Alex is a celebrity.
[01:15:28.685 --> 01:15:35.256]  The point is, I'm somebody who can uniquely tell you that The Awakening is much bigger than you've known.
[01:15:35.256 --> 01:15:36.898]  I just got chills.
[01:15:36.898 --> 01:15:38.200]  It's much bigger!
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.562]  We can beat these people!
[01:16:01.801 --> 01:16:05.825]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:16:05.825 --> 01:16:09.068]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:16:09.068 --> 01:16:13.872]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:16:13.872 --> 01:16:20.258]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:16:20.258 --> 01:16:22.501]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:16:23.041 --> 01:16:23.341]  Tim Geithner?
[01:16:23.341 --> 01:16:23.821]  Bernanke?
[01:16:23.821 --> 01:16:24.182]  They're arsonists!
[01:16:24.182 --> 01:16:24.962]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:16:24.962 --> 01:16:26.603]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:16:41.929 --> 01:16:49.214]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:16:49.214 --> 01:16:58.321]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:05.900]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious long-term storable food.

[01:17:19.191 --> 01:17:20.312]  Are you kidding me?

[01:18:01.217 --> 01:18:02.938]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:02.938 --> 01:18:08.240]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.781]  Saving means to make money.
[01:18:09.781 --> 01:18:18.565]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:18:19.305 --> 01:18:26.830]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:34.834]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:18:34.834 --> 01:18:40.077]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:18:40.077 --> 01:18:42.238]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:19:00.677 --> 01:19:16.145]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:19:16.145 --> 01:19:19.827]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:20.836 --> 01:19:33.608]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:19:33.608 --> 01:19:40.875]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:19:41.556 --> 01:19:51.944]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:19:55.867 --> 01:20:01.471]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:20:01.471 --> 01:20:02.992]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:02.992 --> 01:20:05.054]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.054 --> 01:20:08.276]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:10.666 --> 01:20:17.648]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[01:20:17.648 --> 01:20:20.609]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:20:20.609 --> 01:20:26.390]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:27.771]  Well, he gets it.
[01:20:27.771 --> 01:20:28.851]  I don't like it.
[01:20:37.193 --> 01:20:39.795]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:39.795 --> 01:20:43.257]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:43.257 --> 01:20:46.599]  We're going to Peter in Switzerland, Paul in Ireland and others.
[01:20:46.599 --> 01:20:50.342]  I know that most Europeans cannot call a 1-800 number.
[01:20:50.342 --> 01:20:51.623]  It just doesn't work.
[01:20:51.623 --> 01:20:56.546]  And if you do call the toll number to the network, we will put you to the head of the line.
[01:20:56.546 --> 01:20:57.767]  It's 651-695-7777 to the Genesis Board.
[01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:03.170]  I think?
[01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:37.592]  I mean, it's done with a velvet glove, but oh, those people, they just can't get themselves together.
[01:22:03.042 --> 01:22:05.264]  Well, that's not what's going on.
[01:22:05.264 --> 01:22:17.853]  The colonial areas of Latin America, Africa, and Southern Asia and other areas have been overrun by the more advanced technological militaries of the West repeatedly in the last 300 years.
[01:22:17.853 --> 01:22:20.215]  And systems of tyranny are put in.
[01:22:20.215 --> 01:22:24.639]  And then the last 100 years, and this is mainline history if you research it, this is not my opinion.
[01:22:25.839 --> 01:22:28.661]  And major white papers were written by the British government, the U.S.
[01:22:28.661 --> 01:22:40.767]  government deployed gunboat diplomacy, where they would give a dictator or give a thug, say in Venezuela or Guatemala, this goes back over 100 years, the U.S., they'd give him a $20 million loan.
[01:22:40.767 --> 01:22:47.130]  And openly it would come out, tell him, don't pay this back, leave in one year with the money, to Switzerland or to New York.
[01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:50.811]  That's why you have a lot of Mexican presidents actually move to New York after they steal a bunch of money.
[01:22:50.811 --> 01:22:52.953]  Just a few decades ago that happened, or in the mid-90s.
[01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:55.170]  So it's the same system.
[01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.250]  Or they go to Switzerland.
[01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.852]  That's kind of the place where they nest and it's a free zone they allow.
[01:22:59.852 --> 01:23:09.097]  And so, and then, the public's told, well, with interest, it's been 10 years, you don't owe us 20 million in 1905, you owe us 300 million.
[01:23:09.097 --> 01:23:15.721]  And the country says, you know, back then, that was before the inflation we have, it was the equivalent of 300 billion or something.
[01:23:15.721 --> 01:23:18.523]  They said, we don't even make that in 20 years, we can't pay it.
[01:23:18.903 --> 01:23:20.244]  Oh, that's fine.
[01:23:20.244 --> 01:23:27.986]  From the shores of Montezuma, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[01:23:27.986 --> 01:23:35.629]  And the Marine Corps top general, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Smedley Butler finally quit and went public and said, look, it's all about money.
[01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:36.690]  These people don't owe it.
[01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:37.310]  We invade them.
[01:23:38.357 --> 01:23:40.898]  And that's what's now happening here in America.
[01:23:40.898 --> 01:23:42.378]  Then I'm going to your calls.
[01:23:42.378 --> 01:23:44.879]  That's what's now happening here and happening to Europe.
[01:23:44.879 --> 01:23:50.941]  And the bankers said in the 2002 IMF World Bank documents, they were going to do what they've done in the third world to us.
[01:23:50.941 --> 01:24:00.805]  There's a reason the third world has, you go to major cities in the third world, hundreds of thousands of homeless people and starvation and corrupt police and death and degradation.
[01:24:00.805 --> 01:24:03.806]  It's because it's the globalist policy on record.
[01:24:04.366 --> 01:24:13.230]  In the IMF World Bank documents the BBC was forced to cover to create a system to get them in debt through fraud and then never let them get out of it.
[01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:14.510]  They want you to be poor.
[01:24:15.973 --> 01:24:17.713]  That's why I get so angry at these people.
[01:24:17.713 --> 01:24:20.354]  They are assaulting me with high taxes.
[01:24:20.354 --> 01:24:22.895]  They are assaulting us with carbon taxes.
[01:24:22.895 --> 01:24:27.996]  They are assaulting us with government minders and secret police and spies.
[01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:29.156]  I know history.
[01:24:29.156 --> 01:24:31.177]  I know what happened in East Germany.
[01:24:31.177 --> 01:24:32.397]  I'm angry about this.
[01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:36.078]  I don't want to be a slave because I'm not going to survive in that environment.
[01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:41.403]  Some corrupt cop gets in my face, starts bossing me around, folks, I go crazy.
[01:24:41.403 --> 01:24:44.527]  I'm not a slave, I'm red blooded, okay?
[01:24:44.527 --> 01:24:47.310]  These people are crooks on record.
[01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:50.894]  And they've got this Bengali mesmerized hoax running on people.
[01:24:50.894 --> 01:24:56.720]  We gotta break the hoax, break the chains, wake up, break the mental block, see them for what they are.
[01:24:57.541 --> 01:25:05.705]  And get transparency and government back, have our governments control our money and currency, and take these mega bankers to prison!
[01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:12.728]  And you better know I'm risking my life coming straight at them and saying, go protest them en masse as I direct here for my command base.
[01:25:12.728 --> 01:25:14.909]  Get over there, get in their face.
[01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:17.951]  Get over there and peacefully expose who they are.
[01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:19.092]  All right, I'm gonna stop ranting.
[01:25:19.092 --> 01:25:20.672]  I'm gonna stop ranting.
[01:25:20.672 --> 01:25:21.233]  Let's go to
[01:25:22.353 --> 01:25:25.316]  Peter in Switzerland and Paul, Nick, John and others.
[01:25:25.316 --> 01:25:28.618]  We've got calls in Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, you name it, Scotland.
[01:25:28.618 --> 01:25:31.481]  Let's go to Peter in beautiful Switzerland.
[01:25:31.481 --> 01:25:33.983]  Peter, where are you and what's your view on this?
[01:25:33.983 --> 01:25:35.244]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:39.808]  I'm in Zug, Switzerland and I need to give you some information.
[01:25:39.808 --> 01:25:42.570]  During the World Economic Forum's
[01:25:43.268 --> 01:25:53.950]  In Davos, there are usually these anti-world economic forum groups that try and get on the trains from CORE going up to Davos.
[01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:59.212]  And it's a special train, it's called the Rete Chaban, and this is the same train that goes to St.
[01:25:59.212 --> 01:25:59.772]  Moritz.
[01:25:59.772 --> 01:26:09.714]  And I just let you know that they either suspend the train service, or they control everyone in CORE an hour and a half away before they get on the trains.
[01:26:10.779 --> 01:26:22.391]  Yeah, you've got to, in fact I've seen that and it's on record that the socialists that are going to be there tomorrow, openly are financed by the Bilderberg group to then make anybody who's anti-Bilderberg look like a communist.
[01:26:22.391 --> 01:26:25.975]  That's why we, and they do it everywhere, we've got to have real people who aren't
[01:26:26.215 --> 01:26:26.915]  I'm a dual citizen.
[01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:32.498]  I'm a Swiss citizen, also an American, and trying to get down there I think is really going to be a challenge this weekend.
[01:26:55.959 --> 01:26:57.440]  I tell you, the Swiss are great people.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.925]  That's why they've got so much wealth and everybody's got guns and they got bunkers for the entire population.
[01:27:02.925 --> 01:27:04.827]  You know, the Amish are made up of what?
[01:27:04.827 --> 01:27:07.629]  Germans, Swiss, and Dutch, great people.
[01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:17.979]  And I see a lot of top Swiss politicians, your Prime Minister, the equivalent of one of your Congress people, calling for some of the Bilderberg people's arrest.
[01:27:18.679 --> 01:27:19.140]  I don't know.
[01:27:38.496 --> 01:27:50.283]  The Swiss know how to handle security, and my fear is that they will be preventing people from getting on the trains already two hours from the destination.
[01:27:50.283 --> 01:27:57.527]  Okay, but I mean, that's only... I mean, is that all the time, or have they just suspended the trains, period, for their lordships?
[01:27:57.527 --> 01:28:02.630]  No, they've done this during the World Economic Forum, that the trains leave from core,
[01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:11.037]  And those trains went to Davos and they either suspended the trains or they controlled people before they even got on the trains.
[01:28:11.037 --> 01:28:13.859]  And they're probably going to do the same thing heading down to St.
[01:28:13.859 --> 01:28:14.479]  Moritz.
[01:28:14.479 --> 01:28:18.082]  And by controlling them at the chug point you mean they don't let you on the train?
[01:28:20.117 --> 01:28:22.958]  Well, again, that's because they're scared of the protest.
[01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:30.700]  They're scared of the eye of the public brought to the mountain of Mordor so we can see the eye of Sauron sitting up there.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.880]  We've got to march on Mordor.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.760]  And it's going to be so historical.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.921]  I wish I could be there, but I'm a man of my word.
[01:28:36.921 --> 01:28:40.062]  I told talkers six months ago I'd be their keynote speaker.
[01:28:40.062 --> 01:28:45.363]  And then a few weeks ago, I was thinking about trying to go and be there Wednesday, Thursday, and then fly back Friday.
[01:28:45.363 --> 01:28:49.304]  But I could have missed my keynote speech, which is in the morning.
[01:28:50.004 --> 01:28:51.747]  I'm at talkers, so I'm gonna be in New York.
[01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:04.998]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:29:04.998 --> 01:29:05.899]  Number 1.
[01:29:05.899 --> 01:29:09.342]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:29:09.342 --> 01:29:10.202]  Number 2.
[01:29:10.202 --> 01:29:15.086]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:29:15.086 --> 01:29:15.826]  It's true.
[01:29:15.826 --> 01:29:20.710]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:21.531]  Number 3.
[01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:25.113]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:29:25.113 --> 01:29:28.816]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:29:29.016 --> 01:29:29.816]  Number 4.
[01:29:29.816 --> 01:29:32.577]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:29:32.577 --> 01:29:36.258]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:29:36.258 --> 01:29:37.039]  Number 5.
[01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:41.180]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:46.242]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:29:46.242 --> 01:29:50.423]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:30:12.518 --> 01:30:21.246]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.246 --> 01:30:23.127]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:25.285 --> 01:30:27.625]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:30:29.608 --> 01:30:34.309]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:38.150]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:30:38.150 --> 01:30:39.370]  Others don't.
[01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:41.531]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.531 --> 01:30:43.311]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:43.311 --> 01:30:46.192]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:30:57.895 --> 01:30:58.695]  Others don't.
[01:31:00.051 --> 01:31:05.456]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious long-term storable food.
[01:31:05.456 --> 01:31:06.937]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[01:32:03.855 --> 01:32:05.116]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.116 --> 01:32:08.777]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:08.777 --> 01:32:11.278]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.278 --> 01:32:17.141]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:23.364]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:29.787]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:29.787 --> 01:32:33.948]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:38.250]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:44.192]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:47.754]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.754 --> 01:32:49.735]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.735 --> 01:32:50.155]  It's here.

[01:33:16.727 --> 01:33:31.843]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:31.843 --> 01:33:34.446]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:00.775]  This is going to draw massive attention to what's going on.
[01:34:00.775 --> 01:34:07.361]  What do you suggest, as somebody from Switzerland, sir, what do you suggest we do to circumvent?
[01:34:07.361 --> 01:34:09.463]  Because there are good roads in there.
[01:34:09.463 --> 01:34:14.367]  That's how Aaron and Paul drove in from Zurich.
[01:34:14.367 --> 01:34:21.094]  Yes, I suggest they may have to go to a staging area and walk or take public buses or something.
[01:34:21.094 --> 01:34:23.216]  I don't know, but I know from the anti-vet
[01:34:24.057 --> 01:34:27.918]  Uh, experience that they've actually, uh, controlled the trains.
[01:34:27.918 --> 01:34:29.539]  So people have to be aware of that.
[01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:34.501]  Maybe you have to go pretending that you're planning to go on a, uh, go on a hike or something.
[01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:40.363]  And, and, and, and demonstrate that you're, or, or, or pretend that you're not going there to demonstrate.
[01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:49.983]  Now, again, the Swiss have some of the best rights in the world, but outsiders don't, and that's the way it's supposed to be in a sovereign country, so I can't actually say it's bad.
[01:34:49.983 --> 01:34:57.049]  But that's why it's important for Swiss to go, because they can't, from what I've read, and correct me if I'm wrong, they can't stop a Swiss citizen from getting on that train, can they?
[01:34:58.566 --> 01:35:00.067]  Uh, actually, no, they have.
[01:35:00.067 --> 01:35:04.368]  They have stopped Swiss citizens if they were planning to protest, yes.
[01:35:04.368 --> 01:35:07.490]  But the Swiss have got some of the strongest protest rights anywhere.
[01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:09.310]  They need to file complaints if that happens.
[01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:17.594]  That's outrageous that Swiss would have their right of travel blocked for a bunch of outlying outlanders coming in there.
[01:35:17.594 --> 01:35:21.455]  Well, I gotta tell you, in many ways, this is a very secure place.
[01:35:21.455 --> 01:35:23.816]  And security trumps pretty much everything else.
[01:35:26.544 --> 01:35:30.167]  Well, they're not going to stop people from this quest, and we've got maps up on the site.
[01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:34.731]  And we're not going to be able to stop French driving in, Germans driving in, Italians driving in.
[01:35:34.731 --> 01:35:37.593]  That's why if you're listening, folks, you've got to go.
[01:35:37.593 --> 01:35:39.775]  And regardless, shoot video of them stopping at the train.
[01:35:39.775 --> 01:35:40.836]  Upload it to YouTube.
[01:35:40.836 --> 01:35:43.218]  Everyone listening should upload to U.S.
[01:35:43.218 --> 01:35:44.078]  and European YouTube.
[01:35:44.078 --> 01:35:48.522]  They're trying to block everybody so you can't watch American YouTubes and we can't watch European.
[01:35:48.522 --> 01:35:49.663]  They don't want us to get together.
[01:35:49.663 --> 01:35:50.784]  They want to geolocate.
[01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:53.305]  And they admittedly are trying to go after alternative press.
[01:35:53.305 --> 01:35:54.886]  They're changing the algorithms.
[01:35:54.886 --> 01:35:59.608]  By the way, there's no doubt our term, Bilderberg protests, would have hit number one yesterday.
[01:35:59.608 --> 01:36:06.732]  There is no doubt they've now created a catalog of names because classic anti-globalist names don't work now when we do it.
[01:36:06.732 --> 01:36:10.854]  Only weird search terms that then link to articles we've written work.
[01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:13.916]  So again, the head of Google goes every year.
[01:36:13.916 --> 01:36:18.458]  They are desperate to keep us from knowing they're there, knowing who's there, or protesting.
[01:36:18.458 --> 01:36:19.799]  Why is that, Peter?
[01:36:21.618 --> 01:36:26.260]  Well, I think these are the elites and they have their own agenda.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:31.602]  And what I don't understand is why are people giving in to their agenda?
[01:36:31.602 --> 01:36:33.443]  Why do governments give in to this agenda?
[01:36:36.058 --> 01:36:49.850]  Because he who has the gold makes the rule, and even though they're criminals, they literally control trillions, and they've bought and paid for almost everybody while we were asleep, and now they're so arrogant, they're burning down society to consolidate it, and that's why they're hiding out in a rural area.
[01:36:49.850 --> 01:37:00.540]  They normally go to very big resorts right on the beach, but now the protests are so huge all over Europe, they are literally hiding, and that's why we must route them out, and by God, we will.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:02.302]  So you're gonna be going there, aren't you, Peter?
[01:37:03.052 --> 01:37:05.234]  I will be trying to get down there, yes.
[01:37:05.234 --> 01:37:08.217]  And I'll find alternative ways to get in there if I have to.
[01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:08.897]  God bless you.
[01:37:08.897 --> 01:37:10.158]  We're going to be talking to him.
[01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:12.941]  We'll cover the aftermath, of course, next week as well.
[01:37:12.941 --> 01:37:13.982]  Thank you so much, Peter.
[01:37:13.982 --> 01:37:15.043]  Great job.
[01:37:15.043 --> 01:37:16.564]  Folks, you know this is important.
[01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.846]  March on tyranny peacefully.
[01:37:18.846 --> 01:37:24.611]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Italy, also bordering Switzerland.
[01:37:24.611 --> 01:37:25.672]  Nick, where are you in Italy?
[01:37:27.079 --> 01:37:28.541]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:33.226]  I'm actually in the city of Bologna, which you mentioned so many times about the Bologna bombing.
[01:37:33.226 --> 01:37:39.332]  So as a native of the city, I'd like to thank you for being the only American media personality to actually mention that.
[01:37:39.332 --> 01:37:41.835]  What, did our government bomb you to blame it on their enemies?
[01:37:41.835 --> 01:37:43.136]  Yeah, we're very sorry.
[01:37:44.153 --> 01:37:44.514]  I think so.
[01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:03.296]  I get a bit emotional about it because it's very, very close to me.
[01:38:03.296 --> 01:38:07.698]  So, I want to just tell American folks how close this thing is to me.
[01:38:07.698 --> 01:38:10.219]  And what these guys are doing is just criminal.
[01:38:10.219 --> 01:38:11.800]  There's no other words for it.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.022]  Second of all, you mentioned Asia.
[01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:17.543]  Now that there's going to be a lot of elections coming up in Asia.
[01:38:17.543 --> 01:38:19.844]  There's just that in Burma, there's going to be in Thailand.
[01:38:19.844 --> 01:38:22.405]  And they were pushing one big thing in 2015.
[01:38:22.405 --> 01:38:26.227]  They will have something called the EAC, the Asian Economic Community.
[01:38:26.227 --> 01:38:27.228]  Does that sound familiar?
[01:38:27.848 --> 01:38:32.557]  The EEC, the European Economic Community, we have the same thing.
[01:38:32.557 --> 01:38:34.741]  Yeah, they're already signing deals merging them.
[01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:38.688]  Now, I'm going from memory, but where is Bologna?
[01:38:38.688 --> 01:38:40.372]  How long will it take you to get into Switzerland?
[01:38:42.118 --> 01:38:50.742]  I think to the border is about three to four hundred kilometers because you have to go past Milan and then past the Alps mountains and then you have to go to St.
[01:38:50.742 --> 01:38:52.142]  Moritz.
[01:38:52.142 --> 01:38:53.863]  I mean I might have a chance to go.
[01:38:53.863 --> 01:39:02.487]  I may actually have to pull some strings but I'm gonna really try hard to get there because I wanted to go a few years ago when they had it in the island of Stresa.
[01:39:03.307 --> 01:39:04.207]  Look, you gotta go.
[01:39:04.207 --> 01:39:09.449]  20 years from now, if these people win, you are going to gnash your teeth wishing you'd gone.
[01:39:09.449 --> 01:39:10.409]  Please.
[01:39:10.409 --> 01:39:11.230]  Please, go.
[01:39:11.230 --> 01:39:12.310]  Do whatever you have to.
[01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:13.070]  Everybody, go!
[01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:14.671]  I mean, it's so important.
[01:39:14.671 --> 01:39:17.952]  As you said, the same globalist almost killed your parents.
[01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:18.532]  Hello Alex.
[01:39:18.532 --> 01:39:18.752]  Hello.
[01:39:45.089 --> 01:39:45.670]  I don't think so.
[01:40:00.717 --> 01:40:11.025]  Well, you noticed you were the fastest growing winner until you signed on to the Euro and suddenly they imploded you because that Euro treaty was the agreement to go under their receivership.
[01:40:11.025 --> 01:40:14.808]  You've been economically conquered, but I've seen it in your Irish Times.
[01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:17.290]  Your people, it seems, do know what's happening.
[01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:17.851]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:20.034 --> 01:40:26.656]  Well, unfortunately, the people were bullied into voting for these treaties.
[01:40:26.656 --> 01:40:34.658]  And finally, they bite the bait because money is so much... Yeah, they voted no the first time, yeah.
[01:40:34.658 --> 01:40:39.180]  What Gerald Solentis said yesterday is absolutely correct and applies to this country.
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:42.000]  That direct democracy now is the only answer.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.402]  I contacted yesterday the founder of the direct democracy Ireland.
[01:40:48.294 --> 01:40:52.775]  And told him about your program and to listen to Gerald Sorente.
[01:40:52.775 --> 01:41:10.359]  Because the government we have here, going back to Brian Collins' government, Collins' approach with the bankers, with the bailouts, was basically when you're attacked by a mugger who says, give me all your money or I'll shoot you.
[01:41:10.359 --> 01:41:15.340]  Well, Brian Collins, as Prime Minister, was the kind of man who would hand over the wallet and give everything.
[01:41:16.192 --> 01:41:25.977]  Now that we have a new government, the policy of the new government at IndyKenny is to make a deal with the mugger and pay by installments.
[01:41:25.977 --> 01:41:27.618]  You're going to lose everything anyway.
[01:41:27.618 --> 01:41:35.722]  What do the Irish think of a few months ago the head of your central bank saying, it's good for Ireland to be run by foreign banks, we're going under foreign banks control.
[01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:39.544]  I mean it was just a total statement of treason out in the open.
[01:41:42.054 --> 01:41:48.721]  Unfortunately, the people have been so brainwashed with what Colonel Robert Hickson of U.S.
[01:41:48.721 --> 01:41:57.170]  Army Intelligence called the perception management, as he said in one of his talks, perception management as we called it in the CIA.
[01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:03.457]  If you mention Bilderberg on talk radio in this country, you get dismissed as a lunatic.
[01:42:05.789 --> 01:42:06.670]  And you know why?
[01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:10.335]  Because for 50 years they said it didn't exist, and now there it is.
[01:42:10.335 --> 01:42:13.059]  Okay, it's no big deal, but you're still crazy if you don't like it.
[01:42:13.059 --> 01:42:15.784]  But we shut down whole countries for them to meet, but they have no power.
[01:42:17.315 --> 01:42:19.056]  We're being shut down here.
[01:42:19.056 --> 01:42:24.020]  We were told that by privatizing our trash collection that it's going to save money.
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.761]  Well, it saved me for the county.
[01:42:25.761 --> 01:42:31.745]  But now, I'm burdened with a crushing fee to pay every time my trash is collected.
[01:42:31.745 --> 01:42:36.329]  And they tell us they have schemes they're going to put us on to help save us money.
[01:42:36.989 --> 01:42:38.771]  It's horrible, my friend.
[01:42:38.771 --> 01:42:41.354]  I understand it's the austerity, it's the scam.
[01:42:41.354 --> 01:42:42.255]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:42.255 --> 01:42:44.698]  John and Scotland and others, straight ahead.
[01:42:44.698 --> 01:42:47.040]  If you want to join us from Europe, 651-695-7777 is the international line.

[01:42:47.541 --> 01:42:47.841]  access code.

[01:43:01.721 --> 01:43:03.443]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:03.443 --> 01:43:08.750]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:10.293]  Saving means to make money.
[01:43:10.293 --> 01:43:19.084]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:43:19.805 --> 01:43:27.329]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:43:27.329 --> 01:43:35.333]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:43:35.333 --> 01:43:40.576]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:44:00.265 --> 01:44:04.828]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:04.828 --> 01:44:05.729]  Number 1.
[01:44:05.729 --> 01:44:09.152]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:09.152 --> 01:44:10.012]  Number 2.
[01:44:10.012 --> 01:44:14.916]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:44:14.916 --> 01:44:15.656]  It's true.
[01:44:15.656 --> 01:44:20.520]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.361]  Number 3.
[01:44:21.361 --> 01:44:24.943]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:24.943 --> 01:44:28.626]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:28.846 --> 01:44:29.626]  Number 4.
[01:44:29.626 --> 01:44:32.387]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:32.387 --> 01:44:36.069]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:44:36.069 --> 01:44:36.869]  Number 5.
[01:44:36.869 --> 01:44:41.010]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:45.772]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:50.239]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:46:01.650 --> 01:46:05.611]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:05.611 --> 01:46:14.472]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:46:14.472 --> 01:46:19.093]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:46:19.093 --> 01:46:29.915]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:46:30.555 --> 01:46:40.057]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:40.057 --> 01:46:45.499]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:46:45.499 --> 01:46:52.980]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:55.741]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:47:01.604 --> 01:47:04.445]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:04.445 --> 01:47:08.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:08.507 --> 01:47:20.192]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:47:21.766 --> 01:47:23.367]  We are back at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:23.367 --> 01:47:28.351]  This is Aaron Dykes reporting live from San Maritz, Switzerland.
[01:47:28.351 --> 01:47:38.579]  We have a rare opportunity today because there are literally more than 100 activists here at a live speaking event, which is in all German, which is why we're not covering it directly.
[01:47:38.579 --> 01:47:41.822]  We've had members of the Swiss Parliament.
[01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:46.185]  Perhaps we're expecting another arrival of a Swiss Parliament member, Dominik Bedeck,
[01:47:47.846 --> 01:47:48.947]  Yeah, eminently.
[01:47:48.947 --> 01:47:50.388]  Hopefully he will come on.
[01:47:50.388 --> 01:47:53.989]  We also have Luke Radowsky coming up, and other activists.
[01:47:53.989 --> 01:47:56.631]  We were just talking about some of the high-level U.S.
[01:47:56.631 --> 01:48:02.674]  politicians who've previously been to Bilderberg meetings, who are now moving up to higher positions.
[01:48:02.674 --> 01:48:07.417]  One of them is Texas Governor Rick Perry, a very close Bush minion, who
[01:48:08.437 --> 01:48:11.638]  Was made, if you will, by Karl Rove back in the mid-80s.
[01:48:11.638 --> 01:48:13.298]  He used to be a Democrat.
[01:48:13.298 --> 01:48:19.020]  Karl Rove convinced him, along with people, Senator Bill Graham, to flip to Republican.
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:23.281]  And he only has gained in power and acumen since.
[01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:26.402]  Rick Perry is now the longest-serving Texas governor.
[01:48:26.402 --> 01:48:33.244]  Also, Hillary Clinton has announced today, it's been on the top of the Trudge Report, the biggest alternative news website anywhere in the world,
[01:48:33.824 --> 01:48:34.425]  We're good to go.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:05.546]  To really put third world countries, developing countries into economic enslavement, really continuing what used to be a colonialism pattern.
[01:49:05.546 --> 01:49:11.849]  And now, through the bailouts and other arrangements in Europe, many of these countries are being brought to bear.
[01:49:11.849 --> 01:49:15.391]  Switzerland itself is fighting in an island of the EU.
[01:49:15.951 --> 01:49:22.656]  Not to accept the EU currency, not to join the European Union to keep their sovereignty, and why not?
[01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:25.979]  They have one of the highest living standards anywhere in the world.
[01:49:25.979 --> 01:49:28.241]  So we should stand with the Switzerland people.
[01:49:28.241 --> 01:49:34.545]  There's a really great We Are Change activist group here on the ground in Switzerland from all the different major cities.
[01:49:34.545 --> 01:49:39.029]  Really incredible, even though they have some of the big globalist banks like the Bank of International Settlement.
[01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:43.194]  But it would be really interesting if Hillary took the World Bank position.
[01:49:43.194 --> 01:49:51.243]  Of course, the past several World Bank heads have all been Bilderberg attendees, most of them perennial, most of them every single year.
[01:49:51.243 --> 01:49:55.428]  That includes James Wolfenson, a multi-generational
[01:49:55.888 --> 01:49:56.449]  We're good to go.
[01:50:14.661 --> 01:50:17.523]  In other news, we have received the list.
[01:50:17.523 --> 01:50:18.704]  It was leaked earlier today.
[01:50:18.704 --> 01:50:20.485]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:50:20.485 --> 01:50:24.287]  It's been on DrudgeReport.com as one of the top links.
[01:50:24.287 --> 01:50:33.612]  And we know one part of their agenda is, of course, to perpetuate the war in Libya as they look to other regions in the Middle East.
[01:50:33.612 --> 01:50:35.473]  That's been part of their long-term plan.
[01:50:35.473 --> 01:50:43.818]  Of course, we've just witnessed the Arab Spring with protests, violent protests, crackdowns, all kinds of shifting geopolitical
[01:50:44.458 --> 01:50:44.778]  I'm good.
[01:51:01.423 --> 01:51:16.467]  There was a discussion from Obama to the, I don't have it in front of me, I don't have the exact words, but it was about from Obama to the path to the Iranian revolution using new social media, including Twitter and other aspects.
[01:51:16.467 --> 01:51:18.467]  And we know there's been meetings in the U.S.
[01:51:18.467 --> 01:51:22.448]  propping up some of the revolutionaries in that area of the world.
[01:51:22.448 --> 01:51:28.850]  And coinciding with that, we really have a powerhouse of the internet empire here at the meeting.
[01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:38.075]  Among them, excuse me one moment while I consult the list.
[01:51:38.075 --> 01:51:42.559]  We have the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.
[01:51:42.559 --> 01:51:46.602]  We have also Craig Mundy of Microsoft.
[01:51:46.602 --> 01:51:50.244]  There's also the Bilderberg steering member Peter Thiel.
[01:51:50.244 --> 01:51:51.805]  He's the PayPal executive.
[01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:56.048]  He's also a big investor in Facebook.
[01:51:56.048 --> 01:51:58.870]  Actually, quite interestingly, he also endorsed Ron Paul in 2007.
[01:52:00.551 --> 01:52:03.633]  He's a bit of a libertarian, but also a hedge fund manager.
[01:52:03.633 --> 01:52:12.357]  And obviously they're trying to control the online dominion, and as well as influence all these social revolutions, particularly in the Middle East.
[01:52:12.357 --> 01:52:17.859]  So that's another area to watch as we get more information out of the 2011 meeting.
[01:52:17.859 --> 01:52:22.821]  Of course, down on the ground we've seen an incredible police response crackdown.
[01:52:22.821 --> 01:52:28.804]  We've just received reports that they've challenged protesters on the line a few minutes ago.
[01:52:29.764 --> 01:52:34.785]  Reports last night that a member of the Italian EU Parliament tried to enter the meeting.
[01:52:34.785 --> 01:52:37.446]  He was pushed down and his nose was bloodied.
[01:52:37.446 --> 01:52:40.046]  So that's just incredible tyranny.
[01:52:40.046 --> 01:52:44.247]  And I think Bilderberg's going to see a Gandhi-like response.
[01:52:44.247 --> 01:52:47.428]  But moving on, we have sitting next to me, Luke Hradowski.
[01:52:47.428 --> 01:52:52.429]  He's the founder of We Are Change and has been an incredible activist for the past several years.
[01:52:53.389 --> 01:53:00.113]  And he, of course, has also, as a part of that, been covering Bilderberg for, what is it, Luke, the past three or the past four years?
[01:53:00.113 --> 01:53:01.054]  Too many years.
[01:53:01.054 --> 01:53:01.995]  Too many years now.
[01:53:01.995 --> 01:53:05.096]  Yeah, we're all deep in the trenches at this point.
[01:53:05.096 --> 01:53:15.363]  So I'm going to pass the phone to you, Luke, and tell us some of your observations here, and what do you expect to see as the outcome from Bilderberg, not only this year but in the future, as just incredible.
[01:53:16.624 --> 01:53:40.602]  I think it's very amazing to see each year how much the media coverage of this event gets bigger and bigger every year we go on and right now we are seeing the growth of the alternative media that is covering this Bilderberg Group meeting from top to bottom and it's just amazing seeing
[01:53:41.182 --> 01:53:51.765]  Not the mainstream media that's controlled by the corporations, but the people of this world showing everybody else with one YouTube video, with a Facebook post or a Twitter post, exactly what's happening.
[01:53:51.765 --> 01:53:54.406]  And that's where people are getting most of the majority of their information.
[01:53:54.406 --> 01:53:57.146]  And I have to say, we are the mainstream media.
[01:53:57.146 --> 01:53:59.127]  It's no longer we're trying to become it.
[01:53:59.127 --> 01:54:02.328]  We actually have to become it because most of our information is given
[01:54:03.028 --> 01:54:04.569]  And shared throughout the world.
[01:54:04.569 --> 01:54:05.649]  And it's just beautiful.
[01:54:05.649 --> 01:54:08.590]  I mean, there's so many great activists here from all walks of life.
[01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:10.151]  There's people with kids here.
[01:54:10.151 --> 01:54:11.051]  There's older people.
[01:54:11.051 --> 01:54:11.892]  There's young people.
[01:54:11.892 --> 01:54:19.655]  And it's just beautiful seeing so many different people of all walks of life coming together to document what's happening here.
[01:54:19.655 --> 01:54:21.516]  I wouldn't even call this a protest.
[01:54:21.516 --> 01:54:24.737]  Everybody has a DSLR camera around their neck.
[01:54:24.737 --> 01:54:27.838]  Everybody has professional camera equipment, picture equipment.
[01:54:27.838 --> 01:54:30.459]  And we're here just trying to show the world what's happening.
[01:54:30.459 --> 01:54:31.340]  And it's just beautiful.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:43.710]  The potential and so much amazing things that we could just show people without any corporate mainstream media saying, oh no, you can't talk about this.
[01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:46.393]  There's so many We Are Change chapters here, it's even hard to list.
[01:54:46.393 --> 01:54:48.595]  I can't even keep track of all of them.
[01:54:48.595 --> 01:54:51.478]  And We Are Change Switzerland is doing an amazing job down here.
[01:54:51.478 --> 01:54:54.060]  They organized an amazing event that we're at right now.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:57.944]  They have also wrote their local politicians exactly what's happening.
[01:54:58.724 --> 01:55:03.848]  I've been here for about two days now, and I already got my passport taken away.
[01:55:03.848 --> 01:55:06.149]  I already got detained.
[01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:13.234]  I already got threatened with arrest and deportation from the country just because I'm here filming what's going on.
[01:55:13.234 --> 01:55:20.899]  And the question has to be asked that these so-called rich people don't have nothing to hide and aren't doing anything sinister.
[01:55:20.899 --> 01:55:24.622]  Why in the world are they treating people who want to cover this event, who want to
[01:55:25.422 --> 01:55:25.982]  We're good to go.
[01:55:40.769 --> 01:55:45.632]  And I have to say, people in France, people in Spain, they all heard of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:55:45.632 --> 01:55:47.494]  I've talked to random people on the streets.
[01:55:47.494 --> 01:55:49.295]  I've talked to people at protests.
[01:55:49.295 --> 01:55:51.276]  Many people know what the Bilderberg Group is.
[01:55:51.276 --> 01:55:54.018]  Many people are sick of the left and right paradigm.
[01:55:54.018 --> 01:55:55.759]  Many people just want to be left alone.
[01:55:55.759 --> 01:55:59.402]  They want these big banksters, these big banksters that are here secretly meeting.
[01:55:59.402 --> 01:56:00.702]  They want them out of their lives.
[01:56:00.702 --> 01:56:02.624]  They don't want all their money to go to them.
[01:56:02.624 --> 01:56:03.384]  They want freedom.
[01:56:03.384 --> 01:56:04.425]  They want liberty.
[01:56:04.425 --> 01:56:10.309]  And I was shocked and amazed to see the true spirit, the true ideas that we've been pushing forward
[01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:22.878]  For many years now, so alive here in Europe, there's such a disconnect between us and the Europeans, the Americans, and the people over here have so many interests, so many goals in common.
[01:56:22.878 --> 01:56:26.661]  I mean, we're all just people overall, and we all just want the same thing in life.
[01:56:26.661 --> 01:56:29.824]  We just want to be left alone with our life, liberty, and freedom.
[01:56:29.824 --> 01:56:32.285]  And these people here are suffering just like we are here.
[01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:38.130]  I was in Paris, France, in Big Steel Square, covering the major camp-out protests, where hundreds
[01:56:38.710 --> 01:56:48.814]  If not thousands of protesters were tear-gassed, were beaten by French police officers just because they wanted to camp out in their square to show solidarity with the Spanish movement.
[01:56:48.814 --> 01:56:57.537]  Yeah, of course, we reported the bomb scare yesterday where, you know, our car was popped at the top of the hill and the chief of police told Aaron that nobody would be allowed into the area.
[01:56:58.977 --> 01:57:02.559]  Not the same chief of police who came to this event tonight.
[01:57:02.559 --> 01:57:21.907]  And Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian put out a report this morning where he got a photograph which was taken by one of the activists of the man who was arrested for the apparent bomb scare where the police were talking about some kind of tube-like device that was found in that location just across from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[01:57:22.547 --> 01:57:36.332]  Now, most of the activists that we've spoken to have never seen this guy before and couldn't identify him, but according to Alex of InfoKrieg, it turns out that he was a member of a neo-fascist organization.
[01:57:36.332 --> 01:57:47.476]  And as Alex has just said to me now, you know, you would think that he would agree with what Bilderberg are doing inside the hotel, but definitely some kind of provocateur action was in evidence yesterday.
