[00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:09.942]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.543]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:13.085]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:17.269]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:37.788]  It is Thursday, the 27th day of October, 2011.
[00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:46.176]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, with Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.397]  All right.
[00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:58.286]  I want to go over some of the news, and then I want to go to your phone calls for the entire transmission, except for the last half of the second hour.
[00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:13.919]  Since he's over in Europe and since he is an economist and, well, great financial brain, we're going to have Max Keiser popping in with us to talk about the supposed debt agreement.
[00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:17.362]  And I spent a lot of time last night and this morning trying to figure out what's in it.
[00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:23.888]  And it looks like a classic globalist operation, kind of like the Copenhagen Treaty, where they wouldn't let anybody see the Copenhagen Treaty.
[00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:25.209]  They told people what was in it.
[00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:31.518]  Or five years ago, Bush said, this bill is not an amnesty, but we don't want it to be public.
[00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:35.241]  And then Senator Sessions made it public, and it was more than amnesty.
[00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:41.124]  It actually legalized felons, violent felons, aggravated felons.
[00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:42.805]  So I guess, in a way, it was an amnesty.
[00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.427]  It was a pardon and then an amnesty.
[00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:49.670]  Kind of an amnesty with a cherry on top of it.
[00:01:51.069 --> 00:02:03.499]  And going over the debates in the German government, German Parliament and the Greek Parliament and others, we got some glimpses of what they were reading and it was, this is backed up by German pension insurance.
[00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.422]  This is wrong.
[00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:17.471]  But now they're reporting, today, they are reporting that there is a 50% haircut
[00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:32.815]  On the bonds that investors had bought that were all tied in with derivatives and other fraudulent things.
[00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:36.716]  So what's happening is they're not fully bailing out investors.
[00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:37.756]  You're going, well, wait a minute.
[00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:40.637]  How is that a Greek debt crisis?
[00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:44.618]  The government just signed on to that.
[00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:49.899]  You see, so you are getting glimmers here and we'll go over these articles.
[00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:50.559]  We are getting
[00:02:52.978 --> 00:03:09.828]  Glimmers in all of this of exactly what's going on here and that again just like in Iceland and other countries where they've dug into it the vast majority of what we've been forced to sign on to whether it's the US, Ireland, Greece,
[00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:14.670]  Iceland, the list goes on and on, is not owed by the people.
[00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.912]  We're told, gotta raise taxes, gotta cut your benefits, gotta do all this.
[00:03:20.912 --> 00:03:29.476]  Why big government socialism doesn't work, and I agree it doesn't, because it always creates this domestication, and then they pool our money and rob it.
[00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:35.679]  Some of the poor Occupy Wall Street people that are calling for collectivism, calling for higher taxes, they don't get it.
[00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.540]  You'll never get your hands on anything but chicken feed.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.374]  That any chicken feed you are given is only because it builds up a debt so that the system can have you dependent.
[00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:49.480]  And I know this is understood by most people who live in the real world.
[00:03:50.768 --> 00:04:00.170]  Didn't just grow up with mommy and daddy with a silver spoon in their mouth in some middle class neighborhood and that is a silver spoon compared to most people in the world.
[00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:19.713]  And then you mommy and daddy pay for your college and you go get drunk for four years and then you get out and now you want a job but there aren't any really high paying ones left because of globalism and deindustrialization and so you go to the government and you say raise taxes on the rich people so I can have a job.
[00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:26.536]  There aren't any jobs because of big government, because of globalism.
[00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:29.237]  It's wrecked the country!
[00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:33.799]  That's why there aren't jobs for you with your degree!
[00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:38.180]  Because they shipped our jobs offshore with tax incentives.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.362]  Because they put red tape all over everything here.
[00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:46.464]  Because the globalists own the factories in China and Mexico and India and wanted to move it out of here!
[00:04:46.464 --> 00:04:47.964]  And Eastern Europe!
[00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:49.085]  And Africa and Asia!
[00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:52.714]  That's why you don't have a job!
[00:04:52.714 --> 00:04:54.354]  There's nothing left to tax!
[00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:57.095]  The bankers are offshore!
[00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:00.957]  I'm all for taking their wealth away, they stole it!
[00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:07.599]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.741]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:19.524]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:27.859]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:41.768]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:43.548]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:46.429]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.670]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.071]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.772]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.352]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:58.133]  Got it.
[00:05:58.133 --> 00:05:58.633]  Others don't.
[00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:04.438]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:05.699]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.362]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:11.865]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:17.730]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.995]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:30.340]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.563]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.563 --> 00:06:38.847]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:44.792]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:48.355]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.355 --> 00:06:50.316]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.316 --> 00:06:50.757]  It's here.

[00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:02.624]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:02.624 --> 00:07:14.890]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:22.073]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[00:07:22.273 --> 00:07:26.397]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:26.397 --> 00:07:28.740]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.565]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:34.286]  A $259 value for only $199.
[00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:34.386]  Save $60.
[00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.790]  I think so.
[00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:06.007]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:08.290]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:42.317]  You have found it in the front lines in the Info War, our desperate attempt to alert and awaken humanity out of their deep hypnotic trance to the tyranny, the scientific, methodical, admitted, public, world scientific dictatorship being established now in its final phases of construction.
[00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:51.225]  To use a Star Wars analogy, the Death Star is almost completed and about to be cleared to fire.
[00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:53.727]  And we have got to do something about it.
[00:08:53.727 --> 00:08:57.610]  So the X-Wings are scrambled and are going in.
[00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.452]  Because we don't have a choice.
[00:09:00.452 --> 00:09:05.316]  By the way, I saw an article today up on InfoWars.com
[00:09:07.884 --> 00:09:20.014]  That I do want to go over a little bit later because just an amazing compilation of globalist quotes about how they're going to set up a world government and kill the majority of the population.
[00:09:20.014 --> 00:09:24.397]  And how the UN is freaking out over 7 million people and fear mongering right now.
[00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:28.120]  Of course, they never want their resources cut off.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:35.166]  They want to cut yours off or jack up your taxes and pay it to themselves.
[00:09:37.213 --> 00:09:39.715]  Let me just, let me just do this now.
[00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:44.398]  Let me just go over the news and then I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:54.425]  Max Keiser will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour for 30 minutes or two segments to go over exactly what's happening with the EU deal.
[00:09:54.425 --> 00:10:00.309]  And are they really going to have a 50% haircut quote on the face value of investor bonds?
[00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:14.421]  Again, the Greek government has signed on to guarantee the bank's bad derivatives and the bad bonds that have been issued and tied into the government.
[00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:19.244]  So there's little admissions here, hiding in plain view of what this is really all about.
[00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.064]  And that's good.
[00:10:20.064 --> 00:10:21.305]  I'm glad.
[00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:23.806]  This should have happened with our banker bailout.
[00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:26.708]  A total haircut.
[00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:28.669]  See, I don't need another haircut.
[00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:30.770]  I'm not in the stock market.
[00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:34.942]  I don't own derivatives.
[00:10:34.942 --> 00:10:38.164]  I know it's a big casino and totally rigged.
[00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:39.225]  100% rigged.
[00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:42.567]  Totally and completely rigged.
[00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.271]  Just like the slot machines at a casino.
[00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.755]  We're all computer hooked up, tracking how long you've been sitting there.
[00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:58.623]  There's a wait on the seat to know scientifically with algorithms, when the average person's about to quit, they give you a few coins.
[00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:04.168]  I mean, it's like a chicken pecking at a light to get a few pieces of grain.
[00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:10.974]  And I shouldn't have to pay money to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and AIG and all these people.
[00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:20.786]  But they blur the lines and say the Greek debt, the Irish debt, the Icelandic debt.
[00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:26.030]  The Icelanders are the only people to say no to this after a year and a half of protest.
[00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.635]  And we should get Birgitta Jones-Dottir back on, member of parliament over there who helped lead the fight against them.
[00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:35.658]  It's only like 400,000 people total over there.
[00:11:35.658 --> 00:11:38.160]  I think like 350,000 of them live in Reykjavik.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.181]  But the point is,
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:48.988]  That when they finally fired the finance minister and got into the documents, 90, was it 92 percent?
[00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:54.574]  90 plus percent was owed by the banks themselves that were private.
[00:11:54.574 --> 00:12:00.940]  Just with the government minister saying the people owed it.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.462]  And so that's what this is all about.
[00:12:02.462 --> 00:12:03.583]  And I want to explain something.
[00:12:04.707 --> 00:12:09.249]  Conservatively, we're talking about 1.5 quadrillion dollars there, 1,500 trillion.
[00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:12.511]  That's already been leveraged again, so who knows what it is.
[00:12:12.511 --> 00:12:15.312]  For all intents and purposes, it's infinity.
[00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:20.334]  So, even if we wanted to pay all this off that isn't our debt, we can't pay it off.
[00:12:20.334 --> 00:12:29.579]  But we're told the global economy will be imploded, world depression, European depression, if you don't shine on to all of this.
[00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:32.040]  But it's impossible to triage.
[00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:37.493]  You just got to get rid of it all.
[00:12:37.493 --> 00:12:38.955]  You can't pick and choose.
[00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:40.437]  It's all done.
[00:12:40.437 --> 00:12:41.719]  It's all fraudulent.
[00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:42.941]  It's all infected.
[00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:49.610]  And the globalist plan was to take over the world financially through fraud on the front end of the Ponzi scheme going up to the top of the pyramid.
[00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.814]  Now that you're going down the slope into oblivion.
[00:12:53.755 --> 00:12:58.457]  They're there holding everybody hostage saying, give us more power, give us more bailouts, give us more power.
[00:12:58.457 --> 00:13:01.318]  Waive your national sovereignty completely to the Euro.
[00:13:01.318 --> 00:13:02.679]  You'll never be able to get out again.
[00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:06.481]  We're going to have taxes on space heaters and on every toilet flush.
[00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:07.741]  That's in the news today.
[00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:09.002]  And on rainwater.
[00:13:09.002 --> 00:13:10.443]  And on electricity.
[00:13:10.443 --> 00:13:12.604]  And on everything you do.
[00:13:12.604 --> 00:13:14.464]  The taxes will be over 80%.
[00:13:14.464 --> 00:13:17.066]  To pay off the debt, you owe it, you owe it.
[00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:18.966]  It's these bad welfare moms.
[00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:19.827]  They bankrupted us.
[00:13:20.427 --> 00:13:32.450]  Well, I don't particularly like the surly welfare mom on average who tends to think the government that gives her a check is sweet and wants my guns and wants my private property and is ignorant.
[00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.691]  But they're just a cannon fodder weapon who mean well.
[00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:41.452]  They're more like a zombie, a human wave attack we have to deal with, those of us that are aware.
[00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:53.426]  And they're a very small part of this banquet table of our stolen goods taken to us at the barrel of a gun for all these ideas.
[00:13:53.426 --> 00:13:56.027]  You know, million-dollar shrimp on a treadmill study.
[00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:58.368]  Every time I say that I get emails saying I'm making it up.
[00:13:58.368 --> 00:14:01.889]  Just Google shrimp on a treadmill study, you'll get ABC, you name it.
[00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:05.730]  Millions, I forget how many millions for shrimp on a treadmill.
[00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.931]  The point is, or it's now come out the State Department,
[00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:17.115]  Spending $70,000 here, $30,000 there on buying Barack Obama books.
[00:14:17.115 --> 00:14:20.237]  Your tax money to buy Barack Obama books.
[00:14:20.237 --> 00:14:23.019]  Totally illegal, but they're just doing it.
[00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:31.986]  Totally illegal to give half billion and billion dollar goody grants to their campaign contributors.
[00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:34.868]  You give Obama a couple hundred thousand dollars, you get about $500 million back.
[00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:37.565]  Pretty good deal.
[00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:39.765]  And we wonder why we can't have jobs.
[00:14:39.765 --> 00:14:41.746]  We wonder why the standard of living is dropping.
[00:14:41.746 --> 00:14:43.367]  We wonder why the roads are rotting.
[00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:54.371]  We wonder why they're laying off police all over the country, but then saying, oh, but the officers that are left are going to revenue generate and not respond to all these crimes.
[00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:57.252]  The taxes go up, you get less services.
[00:14:57.252 --> 00:15:00.974]  That's what it is to be gang raped by the new world order financially.
[00:15:01.946 --> 00:15:11.048]  And they're setting up the domestic checkpoints now and having major newspapers that we covered on Monday come out and say, you don't have a right to not be searched on the highway.
[00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:16.689]  Everybody knows in cultures for thousands of years, checkpoints are what an occupied country is under.
[00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:18.730]  Everybody knows it's illegal in the US.
[00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.111]  Everybody knows that's what goes on in third world countries.
[00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:22.831]  Everybody knows that's what happens in Mexico.
[00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.392]  But they sit there with a straight face.
[00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.093]  In fact, I'm going to get to this in the third hour today.
[00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:35.298]  I didn't get to it yesterday because I had so much news to cover, but I will play three or four minutes of my encounter with the TSA.
[00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:40.602]  It actually went on for about 10, but they'd have me stand there for a while, so there's no audio.
[00:15:40.602 --> 00:15:42.263]  So we just cut those spaces out.
[00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:46.888]  And what happened?
[00:15:46.888 --> 00:15:49.890]  I'm gonna get into my Las Vegas trip some too in the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:15:49.890 --> 00:16:01.598]  Just the police state weirdness of it, the decadence, the porn blowing in the streets like some dystopic... And again, it isn't that, ooh, the porn shocks me.
[00:16:01.598 --> 00:16:04.820]  I can't handle looking at images of naked women.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.321]  That's how the world sells it.
[00:16:07.771 --> 00:16:15.457]  That those of us that are concerned about pornography are not lovers of life.
[00:16:15.457 --> 00:16:17.359]  The lover of life's not the sinner.
[00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:27.487]  You know, they sell you the idea that it's that people are prudes because they can't handle something.
[00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:37.015]  No, all the studies show with porn that it actually doesn't then let you enjoy the real thing.
[00:16:38.174 --> 00:16:43.861]  And it actually reduces the amount of actual real sexual activity.
[00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:45.944]  That's what The Globalist said 50 years ago.
[00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:51.070]  I've read the think tank reports that are on air.
[00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.134]  And some of the expanded extras of Endgame we put on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:55.512 --> 00:16:57.573]  We talked to Dr. Kaufman and others.
[00:16:57.573 --> 00:17:02.196]  He was going over how they said we'll get the public on prescription drugs, Prozac, all that stuff.
[00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:06.059]  This was before they called it Prozac, but it was fluoride-based weapon systems.
[00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:07.159]  They even described that.
[00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:13.723]  Because they also want to destroy your brain while they're... I mean, you're high because it's killing brain cells.
[00:17:13.723 --> 00:17:16.885]  It's like liquor, but hits different areas.
[00:17:16.885 --> 00:17:19.227]  And they said, and we'll have porn everywhere.
[00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:29.822]  So that people are satiated by that, but also if they do get a mate, they'll tend to leave them because then it makes them not satisfied by that.
[00:17:29.822 --> 00:17:42.846]  You know, it's the old joke of back in college when I would get drugged to a topless bar, a gentleman's club, and I didn't ever particularly like them because I don't like being hustled.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.545]  I mean, who I'm attracted to was the waitress at a diner who was sweet and nice and feminine and friendly.
[00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:54.684]  It wasn't even so much sex.
[00:17:54.684 --> 00:17:57.685]  I mean, I like an enchanting woman.
[00:17:57.685 --> 00:18:00.726]  I like a friendly, neat, smart, but also beautiful.
[00:18:00.726 --> 00:18:01.887]  That's always nice.
[00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:03.187]  But the beauty is different.
[00:18:03.187 --> 00:18:04.307]  It varies.
[00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:15.372]  But it's always, I mean, a well-known joke that the guys always are looking at the waitress at a topless bar who is covered up and not the naked women dancing around all around you.
[00:18:15.372 --> 00:18:18.493]  See, that's what people are really looking for.
[00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:21.634]  Just like all the major studies, you can look them up, show men like
[00:18:23.681 --> 00:18:29.085]  On average, full-bodied, voluptuous, Marilyn Monroe-type women.
[00:18:29.085 --> 00:18:34.528]  That's, I mean, I've sat there on the street and seen a skinny, beautiful woman walk by and guys are kind of, hmmm.
[00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:39.792]  But when a woman walks by that's got the curves, it's, oh my gosh, boom, boom, boom.
[00:18:39.792 --> 00:18:42.934]  Because that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a goddess.
[00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:45.856]  That's a, that's a, that's a beautiful thing.
[00:18:45.856 --> 00:18:47.137]  That's, that's powerful.
[00:18:47.137 --> 00:18:48.237]  That's sexy.
[00:18:48.237 --> 00:18:48.798]  That's, but see,
[00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:57.782]  The culture sells anorexic women with big black circles around their eyes who are heroin chic.
[00:18:57.782 --> 00:18:59.863]  The system sells death.
[00:18:59.863 --> 00:19:03.345]  See, I'm already getting off into a rant about Vegas.
[00:19:03.345 --> 00:19:09.167]  It was literal porn magazines just blowing in the streets everywhere.
[00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:12.529]  And Illuminati symbolism all over the place.
[00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:15.750]  Giant crystal obelisks, Illuminati eyes, 666.
[00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:23.613]  The cream of America's young women.
[00:19:23.613 --> 00:19:27.355]  I mean these don't look like yesterday's hookers.
[00:19:27.355 --> 00:19:30.417]  Out there who can't get a job.
[00:19:30.417 --> 00:19:37.841]  Out there on the street and you look in their eyes and you know they're not enjoying it.
[00:19:37.841 --> 00:19:39.242]  It's all fake.
[00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:43.925]  And so we're taking our women and just treating them like dirt.
[00:19:47.932 --> 00:19:57.519]  We're taking what generates the species, the heart of humanity, and just treating it like toilet paper.
[00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:00.821]  We are a fallen society and America is going to fall.
[00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:06.044]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:29.668 --> 00:21:38.994]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:38.994 --> 00:21:39.775]  This capitalism?
[00:21:39.775 --> 00:21:46.039]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:46.920]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.182]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:21:50.182 --> 00:21:51.002]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:21:52.703 --> 00:21:52.984]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.888 --> 00:22:05.292]  If the government is busy secretly stockpiling emergency food supplies, shouldn't you be too?
[00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:13.978]  In any emergency food situation, when the local grocery stores and your kitchen cabinets are empty, the first 72 hours are critical to you and your family.

[00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:51.062]  Why face the next emergency on an empty stomach?
[00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:06.435]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[00:23:06.435 --> 00:23:10.599]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:16.344]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[00:23:16.344 --> 00:23:21.970]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:28.876]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:36.583]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.

[00:23:43.609 --> 00:23:43.729]  Okay!
[00:23:43.729 --> 00:23:46.050]  I'm gonna discipline myself here.
[00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.352]  And I am going to just go over some of the headlines.
[00:24:13.352 --> 00:24:23.056]  Then I'm going to open the phones up and throughout the next two and a half hours we will go over all of this in more detail.
[00:24:23.056 --> 00:24:25.617]  Let me see, where should I start here today?
[00:24:26.906 --> 00:24:31.809]  Rogue website bill introduced in the United States.
[00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:34.811]  This is from AFP, French News Agency.
[00:24:34.811 --> 00:24:38.152]  Also have the Associated Press with it.
[00:24:38.152 --> 00:24:43.375]  Just as we talked about this yesterday with Lionel, this is the new global strategy.
[00:24:43.375 --> 00:24:49.339]  They say no judge, no jury if they claim it's copyright or quote, criticizes the government.
[00:24:50.627 --> 00:24:57.412]  The way they spend it to the public is sites that are selling pirated music or whatever.
[00:24:57.412 --> 00:25:05.417]  We've already seen them take down sites that aren't even doing that or that just have links to sites that are allegedly doing that.
[00:25:05.417 --> 00:25:11.081]  But who needs guilty until proven innocent when you can just say guilty?
[00:25:12.705 --> 00:25:14.726]  I mean, it's not even guilty until proven innocent.
[00:25:14.726 --> 00:25:19.427]  We go from innocent until proven guilty, to guilty until proven innocent, to just guilty.
[00:25:19.427 --> 00:25:23.268]  No appeal, no nothing, you don't buy a gun, no judge, no jury, no conviction.
[00:25:23.268 --> 00:25:25.349]  You don't get on a plane, you don't get a job.
[00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:29.590]  That's the no-fly list, which they now admit is a no-buy list.
[00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.551]  This is the cashless society.
[00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:34.172]  This is the system.
[00:25:34.172 --> 00:25:38.653]  This is, you're not gonna have cash for second-hand transactions, or you're gonna go to jail for two years.
[00:25:40.182 --> 00:25:41.463]  This is all over the world.
[00:25:41.463 --> 00:25:43.265]  You're not going to have a lemonade stand.
[00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:47.790]  Girl Scouts aren't going to sell cookies anymore.
[00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.432]  Because you can't be trusted.
[00:25:49.432 --> 00:25:50.954]  You are a criminal.
[00:25:50.954 --> 00:25:52.976]  Are criminals allowed to have a garden at their house?
[00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:53.256]  No.
[00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:55.979]  Are criminals allowed to drive around?
[00:25:55.979 --> 00:25:56.900]  No, no.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.962]  You are a criminal.
[00:25:59.008 --> 00:26:07.595]  To go on the airplane, you put your hands up, you go in a body scanner, they record your genitals, and lie to you and say they aren't, they've been caught lying.
[00:26:07.595 --> 00:26:10.398]  They touch your genitals on the outside or the inside.
[00:26:10.398 --> 00:26:13.821]  You are going into a prison!
[00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:17.404]  These are jail guards!
[00:26:17.404 --> 00:26:18.885]  Okay, I said I'd cover the news, literally.
[00:26:18.885 --> 00:26:22.368]  I get in here and look at like a hundred articles, and then it's just frustrating.
[00:26:22.368 --> 00:26:25.271]  So, um, rogue websites bill introduced in US House.
[00:26:27.037 --> 00:26:31.179]  Here's Paul Watson's article that details the whole history of it if you want the full spectrum analysis.
[00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:34.701]  Rogue website bill creates Chinese style ban list.
[00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:41.405]  Shame when they tried to pass in Australia two years ago and in the beta test they said we're testing it for six months.
[00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:42.986]  They put dental offices on it.
[00:26:42.986 --> 00:26:46.328]  They put stores selling plants on it.
[00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:47.949]  They just put everybody on it.
[00:26:47.949 --> 00:26:49.110]  Anybody the government wanted to.
[00:26:50.373 --> 00:26:51.653]  Here's another one from RT.
[00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:51.953]  U.S.
[00:26:51.953 --> 00:26:55.354]  cops tried to erase online evidence of brutality.
[00:26:55.354 --> 00:27:02.116]  Yeah, there's hundreds of thousands of government takedown orders in the Google transparency report they put out.
[00:27:02.116 --> 00:27:09.957]  Watson was the first to dig through it and find the part where the government said these are videos critical of the U.S.
[00:27:09.957 --> 00:27:10.357]  government.
[00:27:10.357 --> 00:27:13.938]  Remove them.
[00:27:13.938 --> 00:27:15.238]  Critical of the U.S.
[00:27:15.238 --> 00:27:16.859]  government.
[00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:17.439]  Remove them.
[00:27:20.066 --> 00:27:24.009]  And of course they really cover stuff up with their Community Guidelines Report.
[00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:31.174]  We've had them do that with our videos where there's nothing but us speaking about news on it and the videos are removed.
[00:27:31.174 --> 00:27:32.735]  Google has been asked by U.S.
[00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:37.579]  law enforcement agency to remove several videos exposing police brutality from the video sharing service YouTube.
[00:27:37.579 --> 00:27:41.682]  The company has revealed in its latest update to an online transparency report
[00:27:43.086 --> 00:27:48.111]  Of course, there's our report yesterday that quite frankly has gotten no attention.
[00:27:48.111 --> 00:27:50.373]  What was the exact headline on that?
[00:27:50.373 --> 00:27:57.579]  It was Federal Government Told YouTube to Take Down Videos.
[00:27:57.579 --> 00:28:00.802]  Federal Government Told YouTube to Take Down Videos that were Critical of Government.
[00:28:00.802 --> 00:28:06.847]  I want to reprint that or I can go and just last night stack and re-pull it.
[00:28:06.847 --> 00:28:07.388]  But it's big.
[00:28:09.682 --> 00:28:11.703]  It's really, really big.
[00:28:11.703 --> 00:28:17.246]  Coming up after we take some calls, I want to get into this article from the American Dream up at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:17.246 --> 00:28:20.007]  From 7 billion people to 500 million people.
[00:28:20.007 --> 00:28:23.369]  The sick population control agenda of the global elite.
[00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:28.212]  And the United Nations is out freaking out right now.
[00:28:30.486 --> 00:28:37.276]  They've been running around freaking out that it reached 7 billion people, and they say it's unsustainable, then reduce it down to 500 million.
[00:28:37.276 --> 00:28:40.982]  That's been their official number for decades.
[00:28:40.982 --> 00:28:44.848]  And it's got quite a few quotes in here I want to go over later.
[00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:49.730]  of how they want to reduce our population.
[00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:55.111]  So that is just some of what we're going to be getting to over in that stack of news.
[00:28:55.111 --> 00:28:58.111]  That's part of one stack.
[00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:03.232]  There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[00:29:03.232 --> 00:29:04.972]  Let's continue here.
[00:29:04.972 --> 00:29:07.453]  Here's another little interesting tidbit article.
[00:29:07.453 --> 00:29:09.113]  You see that?
[00:29:09.113 --> 00:29:14.854]  The Rockefeller Foundation, the UN, the Bella Melinda Gates Foundation, they built
[00:29:17.102 --> 00:29:31.291]  More than 30 UN run seed vaults, animal vaults, biological vaults of the DNA of every life form they can extract DNA from, and seeds.
[00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:37.355]  With armed guards, or in some cases they're unmanned with gun emplacements.
[00:29:38.892 --> 00:29:40.634]  And, uh, they're storing it all.
[00:29:40.634 --> 00:29:43.037]  Well, there's a new kind of vault.
[00:29:43.037 --> 00:29:47.161]  A new kind of vault we'll tell you about on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:47.161 --> 00:29:49.944]  I'm Alex Jones, GCNlive.com.
[00:29:49.944 --> 00:29:51.346]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:53.888]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.888 --> 00:29:56.551]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.626 --> 00:30:01.807]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:01.807 --> 00:30:08.730]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.292]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:11.292 --> 00:30:16.674]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:16.674 --> 00:30:19.716]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:19.716 --> 00:30:21.777]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:22.017 --> 00:30:28.262]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:28.262 --> 00:30:31.644]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:31.644 --> 00:30:37.428]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:37.428 --> 00:30:39.069]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:39.069 --> 00:30:40.370]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.052]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:43.052 --> 00:30:47.275]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:47.275 --> 00:30:49.857]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:51.878]  End of America 3.com.
[00:30:51.878 --> 00:30:54.459]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:30:54.459 --> 00:30:58.341]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:30:58.341 --> 00:30:59.342]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:01.641 --> 00:31:06.326]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:31:06.326 --> 00:31:12.773]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:31:12.773 --> 00:31:15.036]  Number one, study the past.
[00:31:15.036 --> 00:31:17.438]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:21.162]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.372]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:31:25.372 --> 00:31:29.215]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:31:29.215 --> 00:31:34.259]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:38.261]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:41.684]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:31:41.684 --> 00:31:45.306]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:51.095]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:31:51.095 --> 00:31:55.721]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:58.405]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:01.218 --> 00:32:05.242]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.242 --> 00:32:08.486]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.486 --> 00:32:13.652]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:13.652 --> 00:32:19.678]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.678 --> 00:32:21.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:22.761]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.761 --> 00:32:23.281]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.281 --> 00:32:24.062]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:24.062 --> 00:32:25.223]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.223 --> 00:32:27.464]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.351 --> 00:32:45.734]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:32:45.734 --> 00:32:48.636]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:32:48.636 --> 00:32:57.741]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:08.750]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.293]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.961]  All right, we are back live.
[00:33:18.961 --> 00:33:23.963]  I want to get into flying Humvees the Pentagon is coming out with.
[00:33:23.963 --> 00:33:25.644]  I guess these will be manned.
[00:33:25.644 --> 00:33:30.226]  Most of the military is moving to unmanned so the globalists can just control it themselves.
[00:33:30.226 --> 00:33:37.049]  They already have autonomous drones in the sky now that are robot controlled, not human controlled.
[00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:55.425]  But the biggest growth area in the Air Force right now is just the regular folks that used to service the B-1 bombers, the F-16s, the people that fueled them, put the bombs on them.
[00:33:55.425 --> 00:33:59.466]  They are now training to actually pilot the drones.
[00:33:59.466 --> 00:34:03.007]  It's just a massive expansion, as we said for many years.
[00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:08.988]  By 2012, the Air Force wanted half of its force to be drone, and they're online to do that.
[00:34:09.488 --> 00:34:12.810]  And by 2025, almost the entire force.
[00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:21.175]  They may still just vestigially have like a captain on the airline you fly on who, you know, is there just in case there's a thing, kind of like an attendant.
[00:34:21.175 --> 00:34:27.979]  And I guess they'll end up being a ceremonial position in the future where the captain gets you drinks or whatever, you know, brings you a bag of peanuts.
[00:34:27.979 --> 00:34:30.160]  I guess the captain will be the flight attendant.
[00:34:31.328 --> 00:34:44.982]  Because that's basically where this is going, and it takes humanity completely out of the equation, and also kills the development of human skills, just as the calculator has destroyed people's basic mathematics skills.
[00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:47.585]  That's just what's used in school.
[00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.828]  Again, all of this stuff is a double-edged sword.
[00:34:49.828 --> 00:34:50.809]  I go out to eat now.
[00:34:52.253 --> 00:34:55.877]  And notice that most people around me aren't talking, they're on smartphones.
[00:34:55.877 --> 00:34:58.681]  And I even catch myself doing it myself.
[00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:01.184]  Though I'm getting work done, I'm sure they're getting work done too.
[00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:02.906]  The point is it's changing the culture.
[00:35:02.906 --> 00:35:07.331]  They just had a study out this year showing in the last five a massive drop in the vocabulary.
[00:35:08.437 --> 00:35:08.997]  I don't know.
[00:35:29.463 --> 00:35:34.564]  The greatest language ever because it is a hybrid Mongol language.
[00:35:34.564 --> 00:35:36.404]  It is a Heinz 57.
[00:35:36.404 --> 00:35:37.804]  And it's just total destruction.
[00:35:37.804 --> 00:35:39.865]  The French language is being destroyed.
[00:35:39.865 --> 00:35:41.385]  Culture is being destroyed.
[00:35:41.385 --> 00:35:42.725]  We are being destroyed.
[00:35:42.725 --> 00:35:44.106]  Our women are being destroyed.
[00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:46.386]  Our DNA is being destroyed.
[00:35:46.386 --> 00:35:48.266]  Our financial systems are being destroyed.
[00:35:48.266 --> 00:35:49.927]  Our health is being destroyed.
[00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:53.267]  This is the wages of the New World Order.
[00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:55.708]  Is the society completely degenerating?
[00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:57.888]  And again, it's done by design.
[00:35:59.878 --> 00:36:06.822]  The way of entropy is easier, and it's where the globalists want it, so they go with the chaos.
[00:36:06.822 --> 00:36:09.823]  All right, I'm ranting here.
[00:36:09.823 --> 00:36:17.968]  I want to open the phones up, but every once in a while, I specifically want you to give me your take on a specific subject.
[00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:21.870]  Now, we don't screen your calls, so people can only do this maybe five, six times a year.
[00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.212]  They pretty much refuse always to even talk about the subject I'm raising.
[00:36:28.212 --> 00:36:31.794]  So if I go to you, and you bring up something else, I'm going to have to let you go.
[00:36:31.794 --> 00:36:32.534]  Okay?
[00:36:32.534 --> 00:36:35.155]  Because I specifically want to hear from you on this.
[00:36:35.155 --> 00:36:38.937]  Where do you think the world's going in the next couple years?
[00:36:38.937 --> 00:36:40.598]  How bad is this depression going to get?
[00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:42.679]  Will people fully wake up?
[00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:45.240]  What most concerns you about stage terror?
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.121]  Bio, chemical?
[00:36:47.492 --> 00:36:50.135]  Radiological, what other tricks do the globalists have?
[00:36:50.135 --> 00:36:52.397]  I mean, it's a wide-ranging question.
[00:36:52.397 --> 00:36:54.499]  And it's the paramount question.
[00:36:54.499 --> 00:37:00.646]  I mean, do you feel, everybody I talk to says they can feel the tension rising like never before in their lives.
[00:37:00.646 --> 00:37:09.635]  That this moment in history we've entered is an absolutely critical juncture, crossroads, jump point, flashpoint.
[00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:12.560]  Into the future.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.461]  That the future destiny of humanity is now being decided.
[00:37:18.461 --> 00:37:23.923]  And if you think the quickening's great now, it is only a prelude to what's going to come.
[00:37:23.923 --> 00:37:32.566]  In sheltered America, where it can't happen, we thought, we see the classical forms of wicked police state rapidly raging.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.802]  And just metastasizing.
[00:37:36.802 --> 00:37:46.609]  And we see the high-tech grids, the hidden surveillance pods, and the streetlights, and the citizen tattletales, and anywhere I go in the U.S.
[00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:47.710]  just standing on a street corner,
[00:37:49.946 --> 00:37:53.189]  Talking to a friend with a video camera, even a little one.
[00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:57.953]  Private security guards come over with pleasure and tell you, get out of here, this is private.
[00:37:57.953 --> 00:38:05.820]  And then you have to tell them, no, this is no perception of this being private, even if you claim this sidewalk is owned by somebody.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.865]  And go ahead and call the police, and you may false arrest me, but I'm gonna sue you personally.
[00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:13.387]  And then they scurry off and say, who are you?
[00:38:13.387 --> 00:38:15.729]  That actually happened when I was in Vegas.
[00:38:15.729 --> 00:38:16.630]  I may play that video.
[00:38:17.745 --> 00:38:22.266]  But the point is, it's all about pecking you on the head.
[00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:34.829]  If you're not wandering around like a zombie, or wearing a football jersey, if you're wearing a football jersey and kind of shuffling around and look like a zombie, it's like you're not seeing the system.
[00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:37.030]  But if your eyes are alive, and I've seen this,
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.995]  If you're awake, people look at you, they sense it, you know, the police come over.
[00:38:43.995 --> 00:39:01.969]  Because having intellect, having a spark of understanding, a spark of consciousness, is very painful to the Renfield, Igor minions of this vampire system.
[00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:04.891]  It's very painful for them to be reminded of their humanity.
[00:39:06.254 --> 00:39:08.376]  It's very upsetting for them.
[00:39:08.376 --> 00:39:09.597]  And there's different levels.
[00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:18.805]  I'm not attacking you if you've got... I wore a camouflage shirt because I thought it was cool when I was buying some stuff at Target a few weeks ago.
[00:39:18.805 --> 00:39:21.147]  I saw a camo sweater and I got it.
[00:39:21.147 --> 00:39:23.389]  I got camo for hunting and stuff.
[00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:24.750]  And I wore it on air.
[00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:28.073]  And I got emails saying, I thought men that wear camo, you're saying, are wimps.
[00:39:29.185 --> 00:39:31.846]  And you're being a hypocrite.
[00:39:31.846 --> 00:39:32.966]  No, that's not what I said.
[00:39:32.966 --> 00:39:42.650]  I said that if we had real militia uniforms or camo, camo is meant to blend in.
[00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:46.292]  So urban camouflage would be whatever the dress of the area was.
[00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:48.172]  That's all I ever pointed out.
[00:39:48.172 --> 00:39:53.994]  And that when militias and people show up at city councils and stuff in Vietnam era camo,
[00:39:57.398 --> 00:40:01.220]  It allows the media to make it look clownish, is what I was saying.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.881]  You're running around the woods doing whatever, wear camo.
[00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:05.822]  Going turkey hunting, wear camo.
[00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:08.343]  I understand it's fun to wear camo, I get it.
[00:40:08.343 --> 00:40:10.163]  It's fun to ride a Harley Davidson, I get it.
[00:40:10.163 --> 00:40:12.324]  It's fun to get in a fist fight, I get it.
[00:40:12.324 --> 00:40:17.206]  It'd probably be fun to get a big tattoo on my chest, I get it.
[00:40:17.206 --> 00:40:19.907]  It'd probably be fun to go to a football game and get drunk, I get it.
[00:40:19.907 --> 00:40:23.309]  But I don't do it, because there's serious stuff going on.
[00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:36.461]  And I mean, I'm talking half the adult males I saw in Vegas were wearing, it was an incredible anthropology to just see this culture, were wearing jerseys of their team.
[00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:41.546]  And it's like almost weird now to just be wearing a dress shirt and blue jeans.
[00:40:43.669 --> 00:40:47.110]  And if you talk to somebody about anything but football, it's weird.
[00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.991]  See, for me, that's strange.
[00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:55.172]  I mean, I'd be in a restaurant and people wouldn't cheer when the Bears got a touchdown, and they look at somebody and go, you're not cheering!
[00:40:55.172 --> 00:41:01.614]  Because they noticed the person was wearing a Bears jersey.
[00:41:01.614 --> 00:41:04.735]  And again, that's their tribe, that's their culture, that's what they value.
[00:41:04.735 --> 00:41:09.416]  They don't value their son growing up straight and strong and knowing about his freedoms.
[00:41:09.416 --> 00:41:11.177]  And knowing how to clean a rifle.
[00:41:15.776 --> 00:41:22.481]  I mean, I can see having your son in sports, have him in boxing or jujitsu or something so they can take care of themselves.
[00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:24.082]  I understand being in sports.
[00:41:24.082 --> 00:41:33.288]  I just don't, and if you're there cheering your family, but it should be small events, not these big, you know, music blaring and brainwashing.
[00:41:33.288 --> 00:41:35.529]  Okay, now I'm digressing.
[00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:42.254]  I want to open the phones up specifically about where you see the state of our culture, because I can tell you,
[00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:48.020]  This country has already fallen, but it's gonna fall further.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:55.221]  Because the bigger you are and the more you think you're still a good nation, the further you can sink because you're in denial.
[00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.762]  But there is a giant growing remnant.
[00:41:58.762 --> 00:42:12.624]  The good news was, everywhere I went in Las Vegas, the airplanes, the restaurants, the hotels, I was stopped every 20 feet by people.
[00:42:15.606 --> 00:42:31.520]  When I was by myself, because a lot of the time I'd be interviewing somebody else, so I'd sit there at the hotel, then they'd pick me up and take me out to another location, because he was doing a lot of military industrial complex stuff there, and they picked a region where he had more of the people he needed to interview than any other, and then flew in the other folks.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.703]  Plus, he's got cheap hotels, so that's where the pretty big crew was staying.
[00:42:34.703 --> 00:42:40.007]  We were staying at the Rio, kind of a rundown casino.
[00:42:45.478 --> 00:42:56.607]  So I would sit there for two, three hours while they're doing another interview at some location, and I'd go around and film stuff, and I'd... It's so funny.
[00:42:56.607 --> 00:43:08.416]  I'd be filming stuff in the casino, and I'd see one of those guys on a power trip in his suit trying to look at people, and I would just, I would literally, just as a test, not that I didn't want to get in an argument with him about filming in there.
[00:43:08.416 --> 00:43:10.037]  I saw him stopping some other people.
[00:43:10.037 --> 00:43:13.420]  So I would literally put a brain-dead face on.
[00:43:14.602 --> 00:43:19.525]  When I had the camera, and when I saw what I'm looking at, I'd be like... And I'd see them satisfied.
[00:43:19.525 --> 00:43:20.865]  Oh, look, that's an animal.
[00:43:20.865 --> 00:43:23.147]  It's one of these unconscious people we're sucking off of.
[00:43:23.147 --> 00:43:27.729]  So I literally just kind of... I mean, not even that bad.
[00:43:27.729 --> 00:43:31.071]  I was just kind of... Just zombie around.
[00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:34.313]  I could just do anything I wanted.
[00:43:34.313 --> 00:43:38.075]  It was like a whole big sociology test.
[00:43:38.075 --> 00:43:38.495]  I just kind of...
[00:43:39.858 --> 00:43:41.199]  Went around like that.
[00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:43.942]  And even though it was a caricature of an idiot, they didn't mess with me.
[00:43:43.942 --> 00:43:51.248]  See, the system is worried about power, about human spark and electricity, about soul.
[00:43:51.248 --> 00:43:53.890]  The system is afraid of humanity.
[00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.573]  It's afraid of masculine power.
[00:43:56.573 --> 00:43:58.394]  It's afraid of feminine power.
[00:43:58.394 --> 00:44:00.556]  It's afraid of God's creation.
[00:44:00.556 --> 00:44:02.678]  Because the globalists want to play God.
[00:44:02.678 --> 00:44:05.300]  They want to create an aberration.
[00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:15.908]  And they're parasites who were weak and sought after power because they were weak but had enough awareness and consciousness to get power.
[00:44:15.908 --> 00:44:20.572]  And it is good men and women who are strong and who have a strong life force.
[00:44:22.045 --> 00:44:29.131]  That are so confident, we just kind of put our head down and smile and are positive as we watch wrecked society around us.
[00:44:29.131 --> 00:44:31.633]  And we're trying to lift people up in little ways.
[00:44:31.633 --> 00:44:42.742]  The way to lift humanity up is to face the full horror of what's happening to us and really admit you've got to do something.
[00:44:42.742 --> 00:44:48.868]  That's why when I see people finally jump up out of their chair and say, you're right, I see it, we've got to do something.
[00:44:48.868 --> 00:44:50.049]  But then I see so many others
[00:44:51.274 --> 00:44:57.438]  Who have awakened, and you can see it getting to them.
[00:44:57.438 --> 00:45:17.391]  I mean, I talked to so many people who know what's going on, but they say, there's no hope, you can't turn this around.
[00:45:17.391 --> 00:45:18.292]  There's always hope.
[00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:23.460]  And it's when you get hopelessness that these bad things happen.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:28.141]  And by hope, I don't mean some magical thinking like a fake Obama hope where there's no substance.
[00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:40.464]  I mean common sense, history, what works, the natural order of men and women and families in every culture, what has made culture strong and pure.
[00:45:40.464 --> 00:45:44.145]  But it is that sociological
[00:45:45.885 --> 00:45:47.065]  The children of the trailblazers
[00:46:16.397 --> 00:46:19.980]  Become a little weaker than their parents.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.383]  And the next group becomes a little weaker.
[00:46:23.383 --> 00:46:25.245]  And the next group becomes spoiled.
[00:46:25.245 --> 00:46:34.753]  And the next group becomes spoiled and corrupt and decadent and into aberrant behavior.
[00:46:34.753 --> 00:46:35.214]  Because
[00:46:37.383 --> 00:46:38.944]  They're not being challenged enough.
[00:46:38.944 --> 00:46:41.585]  And so the system creates artificial challenges for them.
[00:46:41.585 --> 00:46:43.406]  The social engineers come in.
[00:46:43.406 --> 00:46:46.707]  That's the one big thing that happens for the general public.
[00:46:46.707 --> 00:47:00.473]  But in every state, wherever the power is, that draws the con artists, the scammers, the mafias, the corrupt guilds, the social manipulators who want to take control of that system.
[00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:12.673]  Corruption will take hundreds of years to take hold in some cases, because it immediately gets power and funds at the first level of takeover.
[00:47:12.673 --> 00:47:15.934]  People say, well, why would elites spend hundreds of years taking over?
[00:47:15.934 --> 00:47:25.139]  Because each step they get more power, each step their family focuses on the next step.
[00:47:25.139 --> 00:47:31.383]  And if you really study corrupt, evil families, they send their children to be beat up
[00:47:32.936 --> 00:47:41.978]  At prep schools, British royalty, the ones that are strong, they don't so much do it now and that's why they're falling apart.
[00:47:41.978 --> 00:47:49.260]  But Prince Charles was sent to a prep school where he was kept in freezing conditions and beat up and roughed up.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:56.441]  And it was special families for generations that have been sent there, certain families assigned to beat him up.
[00:47:56.441 --> 00:47:58.462]  Certain families to, you know,
[00:48:00.185 --> 00:48:06.628]  And then he goes out, you know, playing polo, and fencing, and boxing, and, you know, proving himself, and then in the military.
[00:48:06.628 --> 00:48:08.288]  He's a horrible creature.
[00:48:08.288 --> 00:48:12.110]  But the point is, at least he's not weak.
[00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:18.072]  So that the elites all understand this.
[00:48:18.072 --> 00:48:19.793]  They understand that.
[00:48:19.793 --> 00:48:22.114]  And they really understood it a hundred years ago.
[00:48:22.114 --> 00:48:24.595]  That they would actually send their family off into real combat.
[00:48:28.993 --> 00:48:30.534]  Alright, I said I'd take your calls.
[00:48:30.534 --> 00:48:32.854]  It's just you need to study humanity.
[00:48:32.854 --> 00:48:40.717]  We need to know who we are and what the ruling elites have become to understand why we've gotten to this position.
[00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:43.698]  So, evil gravitates towards good.
[00:48:43.698 --> 00:48:51.781]  I mean, I have learned so much 15 years ago, 10 years ago, even 5, 6 years ago.
[00:48:51.781 --> 00:48:56.603]  I had discernment against big structures, but not people personally around me.
[00:48:58.226 --> 00:49:11.629]  And that con artists and scammers and people would immediately recognize my inherent drive and my inherent humanity and would try to attach themselves.
[00:49:11.629 --> 00:49:18.811]  And now more and more I realize that you don't generally want who comes to you.
[00:49:19.887 --> 00:49:22.690]  You want to go out and find people yourself.
[00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:36.526]  Whenever I go out and find people to work in my operation, who haven't sought after me, it works a lot better than people that seek after us.
[00:49:36.526 --> 00:49:38.128]  And you see that throughout history.
[00:49:40.899 --> 00:49:48.064]  Where people in positions of power, they go out and they've been watching people from afar.
[00:49:48.064 --> 00:49:49.205]  The evil ones do this.
[00:49:49.205 --> 00:50:07.438]  It's well known David Rockefeller on record will show up in the lunch counter line back when he was moving around more and would show up to get the top of a class person who they'd studied their bloodlines, who they are, where they came from, what they were going to do to hire them into the system.
[00:50:08.447 --> 00:50:10.649]  They don't hire who comes to them.
[00:50:10.649 --> 00:50:15.372]  They don't hire the people that come looking for the power.
[00:50:15.372 --> 00:50:26.160]  Evil wants good people to serve them, but they want to see if they can twist good into a compartmentalized system to not understand the carriage they're pulling.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.162]  You're like a horse with blinders on.
[00:50:28.162 --> 00:50:30.523]  They don't want you to see what they're really doing.
[00:50:30.523 --> 00:50:37.228]  They want you to pull this big sled of coal out of the
[00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:39.050]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.987 --> 00:51:02.287]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:07.869]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:51:07.869 --> 00:51:12.891]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:51:12.891 --> 00:51:13.371]  It's true.
[00:51:13.371 --> 00:51:17.913]  Seeds did not perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:18.453 --> 00:51:23.679]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:23.679 --> 00:51:26.002]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:51:26.002 --> 00:51:30.807]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:30.807 --> 00:51:31.929]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:31.929 --> 00:51:35.012]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:35.012 --> 00:51:38.276]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:41.778]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:41.778 --> 00:51:44.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.960]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.200]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.582]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:48.582 --> 00:51:50.344]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:06.157]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:52:06.157 --> 00:52:14.448]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking mines, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:52:14.448 --> 00:52:15.489]  No one can deny.
[00:52:15.669 --> 00:52:26.412]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:52:26.412 --> 00:52:31.413]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:52:31.413 --> 00:52:33.874]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[00:52:33.874 --> 00:52:36.815]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.
[00:52:36.815 --> 00:52:40.776]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:52:50.521 --> 00:52:52.182]  Look in the mirror.

[00:52:54.223 --> 00:53:00.426]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:53:00.426 --> 00:53:01.727]  What happened, man?
[00:53:01.727 --> 00:53:05.349]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[00:53:05.709 --> 00:53:09.154]  Now you fall asleep on the couch, irritable and out of shape.
[00:53:09.154 --> 00:53:10.516]  Don't be that guy!
[00:53:10.516 --> 00:53:20.190]  Call now for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.

[00:53:29.677 --> 00:53:32.679]  Right now, you can try Ageless Male risk-free.
[00:53:32.679 --> 00:53:34.420]  There's nothing to lose, guys.

[00:53:41.904 --> 00:53:43.845]  Be the guy you used to be.

[00:53:44.365 --> 00:53:45.606]  Don't wait another day.
[00:53:50.188 --> 00:53:50.929]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[00:53:50.929 --> 00:53:51.529]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[00:53:51.529 --> 00:53:52.530]  You're on your own.
[00:54:21.701 --> 00:54:27.105]  John Harmon up there in Minnesota running the satellite uplinks and stuff and taking the calls.
[00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:32.329]  He just pointed out I might want to give the phone number out.
[00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:34.290]  Sometimes I take calls without giving the number out.
[00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:34.511]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:34.511 --> 00:54:34.671]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:37.593]  And because I really am, at the end of the day, kind of my own producer.
[00:54:37.593 --> 00:54:40.675]  I have some great producers out there that get the guests and stuff.
[00:54:46.639 --> 00:54:52.122]  I've told them actually to remind me when I forget stuff, but I guess they kind of let me do my own thing.
[00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:57.644]  I always mention something's coming back from break and then forget to cover it once I come back from break.
[00:54:57.644 --> 00:55:07.969]  So let me just, in this short segment, hit a few other news items and then come back in the next hour and take your calls and then we'll continue with your calls with no guest into the third hour after Max Keiser leaves us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:55:08.869 --> 00:55:10.049]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[00:55:10.049 --> 00:55:16.891]  Perhaps I can get a document cam shot on this for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, but if you're a radio listener, just go to the Daily Mail.
[00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.532]  That's really cool!
[00:55:18.532 --> 00:55:27.774]  Facebook puts your photos in deep freeze as it unveils massive new five-acre data center near Arctic Circle.
[00:55:27.774 --> 00:55:35.496]  And what we're seeing is, in rural areas, with the Huff House up in Missouri, that's the biggest house in the U.S., really an NSA front,
[00:55:37.097 --> 00:55:56.958]  And with seed vaults and human and animal DNA vaults all over the world, mainly at areas near the Arctic Circle in Northern Europe, in Russia, in Alaska, in Canada, but also in other rural mountainous areas, the Himalayas, they're building armored compounds.
[00:55:58.132 --> 00:55:59.614]  And here's a photo of one of them.
[00:55:59.614 --> 00:56:02.078]  It's gigantic.
[00:56:02.078 --> 00:56:10.770]  And Facebook's new Cerber Farm in the northern Swedish city of Lulea is the firm's first outside the U.S.
[00:56:11.798 --> 00:56:18.404]  The location chosen because the fierce cold will help keep the company's racks of high-performance computers cool.
[00:56:18.404 --> 00:56:19.545]  Yeah, right.
[00:56:19.545 --> 00:56:24.010]  Facebook looked at several sites across Europe and picked this town for its cold climate.
[00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:29.535]  The move will see Facebook become faster for users across Europe.
[00:56:29.535 --> 00:56:31.336]  And it just goes over that.
[00:56:31.336 --> 00:56:32.598]  No infrastructure.
[00:56:33.769 --> 00:56:36.272]  This is part of a face scanning database worldwide.
[00:56:36.272 --> 00:56:36.953]  They now admit that.
[00:56:36.953 --> 00:56:41.098]  It's an NSA front, along with Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and others.
[00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:42.159]  By the way, don't know that.
[00:56:42.159 --> 00:56:45.703]  Just type Microsoft NSA front, Google NSA front.
[00:56:45.703 --> 00:56:46.984]  You'll get mainstream news.
[00:56:46.984 --> 00:56:54.192]  I told you about it before it was mainstream news and broke it with the CIA, a retired technology expert, what, six years ago with Mr. Steele.
[00:56:55.675 --> 00:56:58.821]  He said he got some real heat over that though and would never come back on the show.
[00:56:58.821 --> 00:57:00.103]  We need to try to get him back on.
[00:57:00.103 --> 00:57:01.426]  He said maybe later.
[00:57:01.426 --> 00:57:02.688]  Call me in a few years, he said.
[00:57:02.688 --> 00:57:04.371]  So maybe it's time to get him back on.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:08.741]  But there's that little tidbit.
[00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:11.862]  Here's another tidbit of technology news.
[00:57:11.862 --> 00:57:15.662]  The flying Humvee gets off the ground as U.S.
[00:57:15.662 --> 00:57:22.144]  military plans first all-terrain bulletproof Warcraft by next year.
[00:57:22.144 --> 00:57:26.865]  It might look like something out of a Marvel comic, but this flying jeep is close to becoming a reality.
[00:57:26.865 --> 00:57:29.706]  According to insiders, the military defends advanced research projects.
[00:57:29.706 --> 00:57:31.026]  That's DARPA.
[00:57:31.026 --> 00:57:32.426]  Nice folks, designed everything.
[00:57:32.426 --> 00:57:34.107]  Your cell phone that tracks you.
[00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:36.562]  The whole cancer virus program.
[00:57:36.562 --> 00:57:38.243]  Of course, it's all compartmentalized.
[00:57:38.243 --> 00:57:40.204]  Only the top brain bugs know about it.
[00:57:40.204 --> 00:57:43.405]  The first model of the futuristic vehicle will be ready by the end of the year.
[00:57:43.405 --> 00:57:49.686]  It's designed to be capable of driving across the rubbish terrain like a jeep, sustain gunfire and takeoff, and land.
[00:57:49.686 --> 00:57:51.907]  But of course, it's going to have robots on board.
[00:57:51.907 --> 00:57:57.069]  That's the part they don't tell you in this article, but I happen to know some little birdies.
[00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:58.989]  But I don't need to know little birdies either.
[00:57:58.989 --> 00:58:00.470]  Little birdies help.
[00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:02.470]  It's actually already been theorized and programmed.
[00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:03.691]  So this will land.
[00:58:05.111 --> 00:58:09.764]  And combat robots will get out, and nerve gas, whatever's needed.
[00:58:09.764 --> 00:58:11.468]  They got drones now that'll face scan you.
[00:58:13.553 --> 00:58:18.096]  We cover that in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:18.096 --> 00:58:28.382]  If you believe in this type of information and want to see it continue and expand, then be sure and visit the online video bookstore, where every order gets an In The Fed bumper sticker and a citizen rulebook.

[00:58:52.742 --> 00:58:56.703]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:56.703 --> 00:59:05.564]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:05.564 --> 00:59:10.185]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:10.185 --> 00:59:21.007]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:21.647 --> 00:59:31.169]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:31.169 --> 00:59:36.591]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:44.072]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:59:53.692 --> 00:59:56.073]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.073 --> 01:00:05.415]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:06.735]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:08.496]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.496 --> 01:00:10.256]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.256 --> 01:00:11.816]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:13.377]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.377 --> 01:00:17.578]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.578 --> 01:00:21.679]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:36.817]  You know, I talked about Prince Charles earlier, but I didn't get into why I kind of mentioned him.
[01:00:36.817 --> 01:00:39.539]  He has come out instead.
[01:00:39.539 --> 01:00:45.084]  And of course, we knew this and reported it about 10 years ago on InfoWars.com and got made fun of for it.
[01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:59.993]  But the British royal family hails originally, where they first became royal 500 years ago, in Transylvania.
[01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:02.495]  That royal house is not even really German.
[01:01:02.495 --> 01:01:04.896]  They later came and took over what's Germany today.
[01:01:04.896 --> 01:01:08.399]  So we always say it's German royalty.
[01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:12.582]  Technically, they're Transylvanian royalty.
[01:01:12.582 --> 01:01:16.005]  And he has a program to try to upkeep the Transylvanian castles.
[01:01:16.943 --> 01:01:17.604]  Like to visit?
[01:01:34.582 --> 01:01:51.293]  But it's in the Daily Mail today, I'll show it to you later, that he came out and said we've got to save the Transylvanian forest where my ancestor, their founder, Vlad Count Dracula, the Impaler, the ruler of Transylvania!
[01:01:51.293 --> 01:01:54.195]  Ha ha ha!
[01:01:54.195 --> 01:01:55.556]  You can't make this stuff up!
[01:01:56.741 --> 01:01:58.802]  I've got that somewhere in my stack.
[01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.143]  Guys, you're not going to believe it.
[01:02:00.143 --> 01:02:03.004]  They're going to take this clip and the New York Times will say it isn't true.
[01:02:03.004 --> 01:02:03.985]  Put the Daily Mail up there for me.
[01:02:03.985 --> 01:02:08.487]  Just type in, type in Prince Charles, Count Dracula, click news, it'll come up.
[01:02:08.487 --> 01:02:10.888]  Not web or it'll be old stuff, our stuff.
[01:02:10.888 --> 01:02:13.910]  Click news and we'll show that to folks and go to a call.
[01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.490]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.011]  Mike, thank you for holding, sir.
[01:02:17.011 --> 01:02:18.372]  Good to talk to you today.
[01:02:18.372 --> 01:02:19.953]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:21.713]  Nice to speak to you once again.
[01:02:21.713 --> 01:02:24.635]  You know, as you speak there,
[01:02:25.502 --> 01:02:29.885]  Uh, it's interesting, David Icke and the reptilian brain.
[01:02:29.885 --> 01:02:34.428]  But anyway, what I want to speak about were the tech things going on here in Illinois.
[01:02:34.428 --> 01:02:44.774]  I live in Peoria, Eureka to be exact, and our National Guard, boy, they were talking about how they couldn't wait until they were going to get the okay for the drones here in Illinois.
[01:02:45.809 --> 01:02:50.610]  Oh yeah, they've been announcing it in Michigan, everywhere, and they're going to weaponize them.
[01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:58.732]  First they're going to have face scanning and taser shotguns that fire a taser bot out.
[01:02:58.732 --> 01:03:01.972]  You can just type in new tasers fired from shotguns.
[01:03:01.972 --> 01:03:09.734]  But they are going to move on to nerve gas, chemical weapons, and armor-piercing rounds.
[01:03:09.734 --> 01:03:13.375]  Just a full weaponization of the government run by foreign banks against us.
[01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:14.781]  You're right.
[01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:16.261]  You're exactly right.
[01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:31.724]  And then another thing that I was listening to, and I looked it up, on Gen, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News, the Court of Appeals ruled that Myriad's patents on the BRCA genes are valid on the breast cancer.
[01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:34.925]  And they're the only company.
[01:03:34.925 --> 01:03:39.646]  Now, that's what I see happening too with future genetic patents.
[01:03:40.507 --> 01:03:41.207]  No, that's right.
[01:03:41.207 --> 01:03:47.808]  They go in and they patent the gene for breast cancer, which is your gene, your body.
[01:03:47.808 --> 01:03:57.310]  And then you, we had a guest on about that, and then you try to go get treatment, and they say, sorry, it's 300,000 smackers for the first part of the treatment.
[01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:58.490]  But you're like, it's my gene.
[01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:00.251]  They're like, shut up!
[01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:02.431]  We'll throw you out of this hospital you get up in.
[01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:04.891]  Cops are waiting!
[01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:07.672]  You wonder why the UN's been taking blood for all these years.
[01:04:08.168 --> 01:04:08.708]  That's right.
[01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:10.289]  No, no, they admit.
[01:04:10.289 --> 01:04:18.692]  They take your baby's blood, worldwide at birth, you in program, now admit it, secretly, and it's put in the database, then they patent your DNA and you can't use it.
[01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:20.212]  And then only the elite can use it.
[01:04:20.212 --> 01:04:21.493]  That's how this tyranny works.
[01:04:21.493 --> 01:04:25.194]  And if you don't like it, you don't like it, you're not good.
[01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:28.275]  Why don't you love your government, Mike?
[01:04:28.275 --> 01:04:30.536]  Why don't you appreciate all they do for you?
[01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:40.557]  And I hope that you've gotten that book of Jasher that I sent that has the genetic changes that God warned against.
[01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:41.378]  Yes, I did get it.
[01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:41.878]  And you know what?
[01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.840]  It's always in the Bible, isn't it?
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.043]  But people that don't have discernment don't know what they're reading.
[01:04:48.043 --> 01:04:49.925]  It's like they said, why do you speak in parables, Lord?
[01:04:49.925 --> 01:04:52.126]  He said, because they're not meant to understand me.
[01:04:52.126 --> 01:04:54.508]  All right, if you've got an ear, you can hear.
[01:04:54.508 --> 01:04:55.789]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:56.469]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.469 --> 01:04:56.890]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.899 --> 01:05:02.080]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:09.003]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:09.003 --> 01:05:11.545]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.545 --> 01:05:16.927]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.927 --> 01:05:19.969]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:22.030]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:28.535]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.535 --> 01:05:31.918]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.918 --> 01:05:37.703]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.703 --> 01:05:39.344]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:39.344 --> 01:05:40.645]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.327]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:43.327 --> 01:05:47.551]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.551 --> 01:05:50.133]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:05:50.253 --> 01:05:54.337]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:54.337 --> 01:05:54.918]  Number one.
[01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:10.232]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:15.117]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.117 --> 01:06:15.858]  It's true.
[01:06:15.858 --> 01:06:21.564]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:21.564 --> 01:06:25.147]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.851]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:29.851]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.851 --> 01:06:32.612]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.612 --> 01:06:36.293]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:37.073]  Number 5.
[01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:41.214]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:46.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.276 --> 01:06:50.457]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.457 --> 01:06:52.238]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.238 --> 01:06:56.839]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:06:57.739 --> 01:07:00.301]  877-327-0365.
[01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:02.823]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:02.823 --> 01:07:15.113]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[01:07:15.113 --> 01:07:22.278]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[01:07:22.478 --> 01:07:26.602]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:26.602 --> 01:07:28.943]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:07:28.943 --> 01:07:33.767]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient portable container.
[01:07:33.767 --> 01:07:34.268]  A $259 value for only $1.99.
[01:07:34.268 --> 01:07:34.628]  Save $60 on one
[01:07:39.172 --> 01:07:42.054]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.194 --> 01:08:22.256]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to Lauren, JB, Sam, Susan, and others here in just a moment.
[01:08:22.256 --> 01:08:24.596]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:08:24.596 --> 01:08:28.778]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:28.778 --> 01:08:41.381]  It is, of course, the 27th day of October 2011 on this Thursday afternoon transmission, or I guess morning or evening, depending on what time zone you're in, around this little planet that we live on here.
[01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:44.823]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:08:44.823 --> 01:08:46.704]  I'm going right back to your calls in a moment.
[01:08:46.704 --> 01:08:51.268]  We'll look at the global economy and what this Euro debt deal really means.
[01:08:51.268 --> 01:08:54.391]  With Max Keiser joining us from Paris at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:54.391 --> 01:08:58.654]  Then I'll continue with calls into the entirety of the third hour.
[01:08:58.654 --> 01:09:07.000]  But one of the articles in the news today, we'll put it up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.622]  If not, just go to the Daily Mail.
[01:09:10.472 --> 01:09:13.275]  We also have it linked at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:13.275 --> 01:09:14.076]  Blue Bloods!
[01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:21.083]  Prince Charles joins campaign to save Transylvania's forest because of his family connections to Count Dracula.
[01:09:21.083 --> 01:09:24.907]  Now, we first reported on this ten years ago.
[01:09:24.907 --> 01:09:25.167]  Actually,
[01:09:25.808 --> 01:09:30.790]  David, I did, like 20 years ago, but I didn't really believe it.
[01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:32.190]  I went and looked it up, and it's true.
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:36.131]  The first royalty, their main connection, they're not really German royalty.
[01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:41.733]  I always point out when I'm on British radio that, hey, you guys love the royalty so much, which most of them actually don't.
[01:09:41.733 --> 01:09:44.134]  You don't even have a British king.
[01:09:44.134 --> 01:09:45.194]  They're German.
[01:09:45.194 --> 01:09:47.535]  But technically, the house that they hail from
[01:09:49.266 --> 01:09:49.686]  He's got it!
[01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:05.918]  He was really King Dracula, but they call him in modern times Count Dracula, running Transylvania.
[01:10:05.918 --> 01:10:10.920]  And Prince Charles likes to hang out there quite a bit, sneaking around in the forest, of course.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.761]  And of course, there's always, to these legends, there's truth.
[01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:16.862]  They're not really shape-shifting vampires.
[01:10:16.862 --> 01:10:20.724]  They don't turn into bats from what's been admitted.
[01:10:20.724 --> 01:10:23.185]  But it was confirmed that in that region,
[01:10:24.365 --> 01:10:26.866]  Uh, he liked to impale people and torture them and kill them.
[01:10:26.866 --> 01:10:31.908]  Uh, but not just in the crusades, but to his own people.
[01:10:31.908 --> 01:10:37.771]  He'd stick them on poles naked, you know, lining the countryside until they rotted down to skeletons.
[01:10:37.771 --> 01:10:43.333]  But his progeny then was famous in Transylvania over into Romania.
[01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:48.374]  Uh, in chopping children's heads off and filling bathtubs with blood.
[01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:50.434]  Women are very vain, as you know.
[01:10:50.434 --> 01:10:53.095]  And, uh, so they believe the blood would make them younger.
[01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:54.875]  Of course, it didn't actually make them live longer.
[01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:57.435]  Uh, so there's a lot of vampirism going on there.
[01:10:57.435 --> 01:10:59.236]  Uh, blue bloods.
[01:10:59.236 --> 01:11:02.676]  Uh, Prince Charles joins campaign to save Transylvania.
[01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:04.416]  Of course, what's a blue blood?
[01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:11.598]  When blood is in the veins, this blue blood is over a thousand year old saying, you can pull the origins of blue blood.
[01:11:11.598 --> 01:11:13.138]  They're saying these guys got blue blood.
[01:11:14.121 --> 01:11:15.682]  Where does that come from?
[01:11:15.682 --> 01:11:18.325]  Blue blood doesn't have oxygen in it.
[01:11:18.325 --> 01:11:20.147]  Blood is red when it hits oxygen.
[01:11:20.147 --> 01:11:22.829]  That's why veins under your skin look blue.
[01:11:22.829 --> 01:11:25.632]  Blue blood.
[01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:27.834]  The ancients were saying, these people aren't like us.
[01:11:27.834 --> 01:11:29.536]  They don't have oxygen in their blood.
[01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:31.537]  They're zombies.
[01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:32.999]  Blue blood would be a zombie.
[01:11:32.999 --> 01:11:35.101]  And I'm not saying they're literally a zombie.
[01:11:35.101 --> 01:11:37.083]  I'm saying these are the archetypal names.
[01:11:40.865 --> 01:11:46.330]  Like a lot of the Illuminati occultism is into Zoloasterism.
[01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:47.952]  And so that's the Dog Star.
[01:11:47.952 --> 01:11:49.753]  What's Dog?
[01:11:49.753 --> 01:11:50.234]  Flipped.
[01:11:50.234 --> 01:11:51.675]  God.
[01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.657]  What's Sirius?
[01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:54.758]  The name of the radio network.
[01:11:54.758 --> 01:11:55.519]  The Dog Star.
[01:11:57.725 --> 01:11:58.565]  That's the weirdness.
[01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:02.067]  I mean, again, everything is run by this cult.
[01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:03.487]  You go to Las Vegas, you see it everywhere.
[01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:05.988]  You go to any big D.C., New York, London.
[01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.189]  It's occultic stuff everywhere.
[01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:12.751]  Illuminati mystery religion stuff everywhere.
[01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:18.493]  Until we get completely inculcated with it.
[01:12:18.493 --> 01:12:22.075]  Until it's just all around us and we don't even recognize it anymore.
[01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:32.792]  Prince Charles's campaign to save the forest of Transylvania inspired by his ancestral links to Vlad the Impaler, a 15th century nobleman better known for his nickname Dracula.
[01:12:34.696 --> 01:12:37.777]  Or, patronym, Dracula.
[01:12:37.777 --> 01:12:47.280]  Rapid economic growth in Romania, which is now part of the EU, means that the forests of the Carpathian Mountains are under threat from development and logging.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:57.384]  The Prince is calling for the forests, some of the last untouched wilderness areas in Europe, to be protected before they get lost, like the woodland that once covered Britain.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.001]  And I did some more looking into this years ago.
[01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:05.643]  And he's also into keeping of the ancient castles.
[01:13:05.643 --> 01:13:08.004]  He likes it.
[01:13:08.004 --> 01:13:10.805]  So there you have it.
[01:13:10.805 --> 01:13:17.088]  This guy is literally the next in line to be the King of England.
[01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:22.230]  And well, he likes Dracula to say the least.
[01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:24.791]  Oh boy.
[01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:25.051]  You know,
[01:13:27.864 --> 01:13:33.427]  Frankenstein about elites trying to reanimate dead bodies.
[01:13:33.427 --> 01:13:37.269]  Turns out Benjamin Franklin was trying to do that with lightning.
[01:13:37.269 --> 01:13:38.370]  You can actually go look it up.
[01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:40.831]  They dug up a whole bunch of dead bodies under his house in England.
[01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:43.773]  He moved and retired in England.
[01:13:43.773 --> 01:13:47.555]  And he's part of the Illuminati Hellfire Club at Oxford.
[01:13:47.555 --> 01:13:56.980]  I actually know somebody, a prominent person, who was led into the Hellfire Club to take part in things and
[01:13:57.964 --> 01:14:02.626]  Hold me this, and then a day later I'd flip the camera on and say, well, never mind.
[01:14:02.626 --> 01:14:08.249]  Point is, it's very interesting.
[01:14:08.249 --> 01:14:11.750]  See, that's where all that comes from, was alchemy.
[01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:18.253]  I mean, a lot of people were, you know, they say he first channeled and really discovered and named electricity, Ben Franklin.
[01:14:21.161 --> 01:14:23.642]  I said I'd take your calls and I'm rambling off into this.
[01:14:23.642 --> 01:14:28.705]  We've got a bunch of economic news, huge military news, some very interesting Second Amendment news.
[01:14:28.705 --> 01:14:34.908]  Support for Second Amendment at recordhighinfowars.com has a report on that.
[01:14:34.908 --> 01:14:37.249]  Incredible police state announcements.
[01:14:37.249 --> 01:14:41.651]  You know, Feds ordered YouTube to remove video for containing quote government criticism.
[01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:42.652]  Google now admits this.
[01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:45.193]  They're being ordered outside of law.
[01:14:45.193 --> 01:14:46.394]  This is criticizing the government.
[01:14:46.394 --> 01:14:46.734]  Take it down.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.622]  And they've introduced a bill, a rogue website bill introduced in the U.S.
[01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:52.942]  House.
[01:14:52.942 --> 01:14:54.384]  No judge, no jury.
[01:14:54.384 --> 01:14:55.925]  They say your website's rogue.
[01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:56.345]  It's gone.
[01:14:56.345 --> 01:15:00.029]  That's AFPAP.
[01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:04.052]  A rogue website bill creates a Chinese-style ban list.
[01:15:04.052 --> 01:15:10.698]  See, the kill switch is going to be a la carte.
[01:15:10.698 --> 01:15:12.179]  And you're like, well, they won't do that.
[01:15:12.179 --> 01:15:12.840]  Yes, they will.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.920]  They're going to do everything.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.343]  They're doing a forced takeover of all media
[01:15:17.102 --> 01:15:19.926]  Next month, I will be going off the air.
[01:15:19.926 --> 01:15:22.289]  I think it's 2 o'clock Eastern.
[01:15:22.289 --> 01:15:23.851]  I'll be on at 1 o'clock.
[01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:24.592]  Look that up again.
[01:15:24.592 --> 01:15:26.014]  Look up the EAS date for me.
[01:15:26.014 --> 01:15:27.456]  I think it's like November.
[01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.379]  I don't want to say the date.
[01:15:29.379 --> 01:15:30.981]  I don't have the article in front of me.
[01:15:30.981 --> 01:15:33.784]  Just type national EAS biggest ever to be run.
[01:15:33.784 --> 01:15:34.205]  It'll come up.
[01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:40.473]  It's coming up in just a few days, and while we're on air, we will be taken off.
[01:15:40.473 --> 01:15:45.896]  And the radio station isn't going to, when the thing starts blipping and gives them an order, going to flip the switch.
[01:15:45.896 --> 01:15:48.397]  It's been wired in since 96 to take over.
[01:15:48.397 --> 01:15:50.378]  It's now going to do the taking over.
[01:15:50.378 --> 01:15:53.480]  And they've announced they're going to start breaking in with their own announcements.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.002]  Not just there's a wildfire in the area or a missing kid or whatever.
[01:15:57.842 --> 01:16:00.323]  Your local police are going to be breaking in in the future.
[01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:01.903]  Janet Napolitano is going to break in.
[01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:05.705]  They've announced they want whole blocks of radio and TV now.
[01:16:05.705 --> 01:16:08.266]  And of course, you think, well, you just won't watch TV, huh?
[01:16:08.266 --> 01:16:12.207]  Oh, when you go to the grocery store, there's going to be jumbotrons saying, don't trust your neighbor.
[01:16:12.207 --> 01:16:15.708]  Just blasting your unwitting children with fear.
[01:16:15.708 --> 01:16:18.029]  And they're already starting with jumbotrons.
[01:16:18.029 --> 01:16:20.330]  What's in mommy and daddy's medicine cabinet?
[01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:23.171]  And kids are taught in school, mad at your parents disciplining you?
[01:16:23.171 --> 01:16:23.931]  Just report them.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.181]  And kids at first think it's fun.
[01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:26.881]  I've seen the reports.
[01:16:26.881 --> 01:16:32.225]  When their parents are taken and the kids are taken to foster care, it's time for foster care rape room!
[01:16:32.225 --> 01:16:35.647]  See, it's not funny anymore, but the kid didn't know.
[01:16:35.647 --> 01:16:39.430]  They thought, you know, seven years old, they were getting back at mommy and daddy.
[01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.531]  But really, they got grabbed by the ghouls!
[01:16:42.452 --> 01:16:45.434]  Buy the Renfields and drug off to the government!
[01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:51.818]  And if they really want them, they might put them on a plane to Saudi Arabia, where some real live vampires can chop their head off!
[01:16:51.818 --> 01:16:55.300]  They don't live forever, but they are vampires!
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.481]  I like it!
[01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:57.501]  It's fun for them!
[01:16:57.501 --> 01:17:02.604]  See, all these archetypes tell you what they do.
[01:17:02.604 --> 01:17:05.146]  Count Dracula with a baby, giving it to his women.
[01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:08.292]  They're all, ah, biting into it.
[01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:15.676]  This abortion, death, diseasing our children, GMO, vaccines, desecrating, killing, murdering.
[01:17:15.676 --> 01:17:19.599]  All right, let's go ahead.
[01:17:19.599 --> 01:17:24.302]  But they're saving us from Al-Qaeda, who they just gave Libya.
[01:17:24.302 --> 01:17:25.703]  Let's talk to Lauren in Texas.
[01:17:25.703 --> 01:17:30.866]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Lauren.
[01:17:30.866 --> 01:17:31.527]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:31.527 --> 01:17:31.707]  Hey.
[01:17:31.707 --> 01:17:33.808]  Sorry, I was going through the radio.
[01:17:33.808 --> 01:17:34.649]  That's OK, go ahead.
[01:17:35.565 --> 01:17:36.686]  Glad to talk to you again.
[01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:44.931]  Last time I... Anyway, I do have a topic that's on subject, but I was wondering if maybe I could touch a couple of things.
[01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:45.751]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:17:45.751 --> 01:17:48.593]  This is what happens with my show, and it's why I may go to call screening.
[01:17:50.074 --> 01:17:51.855]  Because we don't screen your calls.
[01:17:51.855 --> 01:17:57.019]  I said I'd like to have it on, you know, on the subject of where do you see the world going, which is a pretty wide open area.
[01:17:57.019 --> 01:18:00.041]  And then everybody calls in and wants me to screen their call.
[01:18:00.041 --> 01:18:04.745]  Because people are used to call and talk radio and, yeah, what's your, you know, okay, what's your view?
[01:18:04.745 --> 01:18:06.266]  What would you like to say on this?
[01:18:06.266 --> 01:18:09.228]  Let me pre-screen you to make sure it's what I want to hear from you.
[01:18:09.228 --> 01:18:12.891]  And so instead, though, we go ahead and just screen the calls.
[01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:15.693]  But, sir, you can talk about what, just go ahead.
[01:18:15.693 --> 01:18:17.714]  Obviously, you're not going to, just go ahead.
[01:18:17.714 --> 01:18:18.415]  We're almost out of time.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.582]  Oh, no, it's on subject.
[01:18:21.582 --> 01:18:24.764]  I was wondering, have you ever seen the movie Brazil?
[01:18:24.764 --> 01:18:25.365]  Oh, yeah, no, no.
[01:18:25.365 --> 01:18:26.766]  That's where you think things are going.
[01:18:26.766 --> 01:18:27.166]  Yes.
[01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:36.273]  It's kind of a dystopic redo of 1984 with a intellectual flourish by Terry Gilliam and is a masterpiece.
[01:18:36.273 --> 01:18:37.894]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:37.894 --> 01:18:41.337]  Terry Gilliam, you can tell he loves life and his movies and everything else.
[01:18:41.337 --> 01:18:45.380]  But what I guess, you know, I think that
[01:18:46.007 --> 01:18:52.071]  Pop culture or entertainment, creative arts, you know, creativity is creating new things.
[01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:53.192]  It's what life is about.
[01:18:53.192 --> 01:18:55.394]  It's creation, not destruction and not death.
[01:18:55.394 --> 01:18:58.456]  And, you know, it's this cult and religion of death and destruction.
[01:18:58.456 --> 01:18:59.016]  No, that's it.
[01:18:59.016 --> 01:19:01.478]  The globalists do not like creation.
[01:19:01.478 --> 01:19:04.260]  That's why they like to make ugly things that don't work right.
[01:19:05.399 --> 01:19:06.859]  And that's what they do.
[01:19:06.859 --> 01:19:09.260]  And that's why they don't like you if you're healthy and good.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.882]  Because they are literal, soul-sucking, psychic vampire trash that must be dealt with.
[01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.822]  I'm sorry, I'm gonna hold you over.
[01:19:15.822 --> 01:19:16.882]  Go ahead.
[01:19:16.882 --> 01:19:22.924]  They have to control, you know, what creation actually is taking place and push it in the direction that they want it to go.
[01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:29.886]  So as much as we work and we create and we produce, they're destroying and perverting and twisting it.
[01:19:29.886 --> 01:19:32.367]  And it's like you were saying, quoting that music,
[01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.930]  Yeah, I just said so.
[01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:37.291]  Yeah, yeah, I want to hear from you.
[01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:38.432]  And I'm sorry if I get irritated.
[01:19:38.432 --> 01:19:41.934]  I just got... I'm frustrated with myself because I got a million articles I want to get to.
[01:19:41.934 --> 01:19:43.175]  I've gotten to a lot.
[01:19:43.175 --> 01:19:44.896]  And I've got all these callers I want to talk to.
[01:19:44.896 --> 01:19:45.917]  And I got guests coming up.
[01:19:45.917 --> 01:19:48.659]  But we'll get to everybody.
[01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:53.302]  And I mainly... When I get irritated, it's not generally with the callers.
[01:19:53.302 --> 01:19:59.646]  It's just I'm irritated with... If I could show people what I know, our problems would be over very quickly.
[01:20:00.984 --> 01:20:04.966]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?

[01:22:59.696 --> 01:23:04.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.160]  Number one.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.583]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:09.444]  Number two.
[01:23:09.444 --> 01:23:14.348]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:23:14.348 --> 01:23:15.088]  It's true.
[01:23:15.088 --> 01:23:19.652]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:23:19.952 --> 01:23:20.773]  Number 3.
[01:23:20.773 --> 01:23:24.356]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:23:24.356 --> 01:23:28.280]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.080]  Number 4.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.843]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:23:31.843 --> 01:23:35.526]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:36.307]  Number 5.
[01:23:36.307 --> 01:23:40.451]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:45.215]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:23:45.495 --> 01:23:49.662]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:23:49.662 --> 01:23:51.465]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:53.709]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:56.053]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:29.497]  Well, that was a really good caller, and he hung up.
[01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:30.477]  I said, yeah, hold over.
[01:24:30.477 --> 01:24:33.798]  And then they always go, okay, and then they hang up.
[01:24:33.798 --> 01:24:41.260]  I want him to be able to finish his point about the globalists are control freaks, and they want to dominate everybody.
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:45.722]  And so they're jealous of people that are strong, pure, and good.
[01:24:45.722 --> 01:24:48.643]  That's why they want to corrupt people.
[01:24:48.643 --> 01:24:52.724]  That's why they attack values.
[01:24:52.724 --> 01:24:54.464]  That's why the social engineers do that.
[01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.045]  They want a screwed up society.
[01:24:57.031 --> 01:25:11.282]  In fact, in some of these quotes by the UN and others, they say, we're going to give everybody a chemical in their food and water, and in the future we'll announce it to the public, and then only via government authorization will you be given the antidote to have children.
[01:25:11.282 --> 01:25:14.084]  See, people keep asking, why would the elites be doing all this?
[01:25:14.084 --> 01:25:16.466]  Because they have antidotes.
[01:25:16.466 --> 01:25:19.749]  They have antidotes to the aluminum dioxide chemtrails.
[01:25:19.749 --> 01:25:21.150]  They have antidotes to the vaccines.
[01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:24.993]  They have antidotes.
[01:25:24.993 --> 01:25:26.014]  These people are so horrible.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:47.873]  And only your mental weakness, I mean literally, 99% of the people that serve these people, who've staked apart mental lives and, oh, this isn't true, you're under attack as well, and only your mental weakness will keep you from looking at the articles we posted today with links to the elites saying this about you.
[01:25:47.873 --> 01:25:54.778]  Dozens and dozens of quotes from the UN, you name it, this is their plan, Planned Parenthood, US government, CIA,
[01:25:56.331 --> 01:25:58.352]  Will you go read them and follow the links?
[01:25:58.352 --> 01:26:09.476]  Will you go to the Rockefeller Foundation's own site where they help brag that they develop vaccines that say they do one thing but really are designed to sterilize your butt?
[01:26:09.476 --> 01:26:13.898]  I mean, it's come out what we told you a decade ago, flu shots do not protect you.
[01:26:13.898 --> 01:26:20.801]  They're saying 1.5% of the time out of 100, almost 99% of the time doesn't protect you.
[01:26:20.801 --> 01:26:22.482]  And that's their government study.
[01:26:24.369 --> 01:26:31.394]  If you add into autoimmune system destruction, which they admit the flu shots do, then it actually causes the flu.
[01:26:31.394 --> 01:26:32.114]  See, they don't have...
[01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:34.569]  Full-spectrum analysis.
[01:26:34.569 --> 01:26:45.512]  Anyone involved in full-spectrum analysis would immediately integrate a cross-reference overlay stratagem inside their mind to give a full-spectrum analysis, and that's not even a full-spectrum analysis.
[01:26:45.512 --> 01:26:53.313]  I cannot verbally give you a full-spectrum analysis because I just overlaid probably a thousand things at a subconscious level for a full-spectrum analysis.
[01:26:53.313 --> 01:26:57.514]  I gave you a two-overlay analysis right there.
[01:26:57.514 --> 01:26:59.855]  If the major Canadian, German, and U.S.
[01:26:59.855 --> 01:27:01.035]  studies showed that
[01:27:01.835 --> 01:27:11.483]  The H1N1 shot doubles your chances of getting the seasonal flu that year or the next, and that other similar flu shots have the same or worse effect.
[01:27:11.483 --> 01:27:26.556]  If doubling your chances of the flu the next year, overlaid with the shot you're taking with a 1.5 out of 100 people chance of protecting you, then do the equation.
[01:27:26.556 --> 01:27:29.979]  It's actually point
[01:27:31.831 --> 01:27:38.332]  1.5 under double.
[01:27:38.332 --> 01:27:43.373]  So, flu shots right at double your chances for flu.
[01:27:43.373 --> 01:27:47.114]  You're right at double, not double.
[01:27:47.114 --> 01:27:50.634]  You're 1.5 beneath double.
[01:27:50.634 --> 01:27:57.996]  And that doesn't start adding in all the other equations.
[01:27:57.996 --> 01:28:00.216]  This is mass death.
[01:28:00.216 --> 01:28:00.396]  I mean,
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.042]  Here's my problem.
[01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:07.368]  I watch... I'm going to try to play a little bit tonight.
[01:28:07.368 --> 01:28:13.355]  An ABC newscast with a doctor up there with this whole pitch of, I didn't want to take it at first, but then I decided I didn't.
[01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:16.098]  I didn't.
[01:28:16.098 --> 01:28:20.160]  Then I knew a guy who got throat cancer, so I'm making my kids take it.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.922]  It's all this pitch for people that have said, I'm not taking H1N1 shot.
[01:28:23.922 --> 01:28:27.724]  Not giving it to my daughter, not giving it to my kid, the deaths, the illnesses, all this.
[01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:29.965]  It's the same pitch, different doctors, different shows.
[01:28:29.965 --> 01:28:31.086]  They're following a script.
[01:28:31.086 --> 01:28:35.448]  And the guy looks so nervous while he's talking, and like he's doing something really bad.
[01:28:35.448 --> 01:28:39.590]  But a big payoff's coming, obviously, through the system.
[01:28:41.547 --> 01:28:49.072]  And it's not even a spoken thing, you just get invited to the big speaking engagements, the book deals, the TV deals, because you sell your soul right there.
[01:28:49.072 --> 01:28:53.074]  And he's sitting there going, yeah, I didn't want to take it before, but now I see it, everybody should have it.
[01:28:53.074 --> 01:29:09.684]  And they're going, yes, all these cancers, anal cancer, throat cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, but then a little bitty asterisk at the bottom, the cancers, when caused by this virus, which is the rarest form, 99, I mean, way more than 99%.
[01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:16.872]  of the throat cancer, anal cancer, intestinal cancer, is other forms of cancer.
[01:29:16.872 --> 01:29:24.118]  But they were implying all over TV and on all these shows I've seen that H1N1, you're not going to get throat cancer.
[01:29:24.118 --> 01:29:27.101]  You're not going to get all these other forms of cancer.
[01:29:27.101 --> 01:29:28.442]  And they're acting like, wow!
[01:29:28.442 --> 01:29:31.704]  See, it's really the vaccines are giving you the cancer.
[01:29:31.704 --> 01:29:33.466]  And they know this information's out.
[01:29:33.466 --> 01:29:35.888]  So they come up with a vaccine that stops cancer.
[01:29:37.912 --> 01:29:44.034]  But on their own insert it admits it doesn't even stop that form of papillomavirus-triggered cancer.
[01:29:44.034 --> 01:29:47.714]  See, they never even want to discuss the fact that cancer is viral.
[01:29:47.714 --> 01:29:50.275]  So they're trying to spin what we've exposed.
[01:29:50.275 --> 01:29:51.655]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.655 --> 01:29:54.176]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.176 --> 01:29:56.857]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.997 --> 01:30:03.699]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.699 --> 01:30:09.006]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:09.006 --> 01:30:10.549]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.549 --> 01:30:19.340]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:20.061 --> 01:30:27.584]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.584 --> 01:30:35.587]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.587 --> 01:30:40.829]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:31:04.699 --> 01:31:05.959]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.959 --> 01:31:09.540]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.301]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.301 --> 01:31:18.003]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:18.003 --> 01:31:24.665]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.665 --> 01:31:30.627]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.627 --> 01:31:34.348]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.808 --> 01:31:39.112]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.112 --> 01:31:45.056]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.056 --> 01:31:48.619]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.619 --> 01:31:50.580]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:51.721]  It's here.

[01:32:07.544 --> 01:32:12.705]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.705 --> 01:32:21.427]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:21.427 --> 01:32:25.488]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:32:25.488 --> 01:32:27.849]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:32:29.755 --> 01:32:34.497]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:34.497 --> 01:32:39.578]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:32:39.578 --> 01:32:41.719]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.719 --> 01:32:43.500]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.401]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.401 --> 01:32:53.023]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:53.023 --> 01:32:55.724]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:55.724 --> 01:32:58.585]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[01:33:07.478 --> 01:33:22.587]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:22.587 --> 01:33:28.651]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:32.954]  Okay, I've been rattling on as they say, but I promise we're going to get to
[01:33:34.719 --> 01:33:39.362]  Sam, Susan, JB, John, and Doug.
[01:33:39.362 --> 01:33:41.824]  And I will take a ton of calls in the third hour.
[01:33:41.824 --> 01:33:46.366]  We got Max Keiser coming up, so those callers can hold, they can hang up, other people can call in.
[01:33:46.366 --> 01:33:49.288]  I'm gonna get to you though, and I appreciate you calling in.
[01:33:49.288 --> 01:33:50.989]  I hear the broadcast and appreciate your time.
[01:33:50.989 --> 01:33:54.231]  I just start then thinking, that's the problem.
[01:33:54.231 --> 01:33:55.372]  That's why I never shut up.
[01:33:55.372 --> 01:34:02.477]  Because there's always a thousand other data points, analysis, factoids, total proof of the globalist lies.
[01:34:03.317 --> 01:34:04.577]  That I want to warn you about.
[01:34:04.577 --> 01:34:06.578]  I mean on the vaccine subject.
[01:34:06.578 --> 01:34:10.679]  It's been known forever that they never get the right flu the year before.
[01:34:10.679 --> 01:34:12.760]  Guessing what it'll be the next year.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:18.021]  And then there's the fact of what injecting yourself with an attenuated flu virus does.
[01:34:18.021 --> 01:34:21.422]  They've known for 50 years this stuff destroys the immune system.
[01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:23.123]  Triggers cancer on its own.
[01:34:23.123 --> 01:34:30.945]  The adjuvants bound with RNA and DNA from the different tissues they're growing it on jumps into the rest of the tissues.
[01:34:31.545 --> 01:34:32.766]  They know it, okay?
[01:34:32.766 --> 01:34:34.247]  They're adding stuff to it.
[01:34:34.247 --> 01:34:36.068]  We've got the documents.
[01:34:36.068 --> 01:34:38.510]  We're seen as a cancer.
[01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:41.052]  And the globalists are giving us cancer.
[01:34:41.052 --> 01:34:43.054]  And I'm going to show some more proof of this tonight.
[01:34:43.054 --> 01:34:46.917]  I covered it some last night, but tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:34:46.917 --> 01:34:50.559]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber, now is the time.
[01:34:50.559 --> 01:34:54.502]  We've got the fourth annual Money Bomb kicking off next Thursday through Friday.
[01:34:54.502 --> 01:34:56.183]  I'll broadcast 24 hours.
[01:34:56.183 --> 01:34:57.184]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:34:58.425 --> 01:34:59.966]  is the website.
[01:34:59.966 --> 01:35:00.687]  I've been so busy.
[01:35:00.687 --> 01:35:02.308]  We normally promote these Money Bombs for a month.
[01:35:02.308 --> 01:35:04.169]  I've been done it 15 days out.
[01:35:04.169 --> 01:35:09.672]  And we need to hit that goal of $100,000 even before it kicks off to try to get to our goal.
[01:35:09.672 --> 01:35:11.153]  That's what we did last year.
[01:35:11.153 --> 01:35:14.735]  So, folks, please donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:35:14.735 --> 01:35:17.757]  Max Keiser is coming up in a moment.
[01:35:17.757 --> 01:35:21.119]  But on the Money Bomb issue, think of the trick, the mind game.
[01:35:21.119 --> 01:35:24.782]  David Rockefeller, you know, and in his tax-free foundations,
[01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:27.691]  Giving money, also U.S.
[01:35:27.691 --> 01:35:29.012]  taxpayer money.
[01:35:29.012 --> 01:35:38.594]  And then citizens go and give money to their local NPR station to be bombarded with New World Order left-wing side of the brainwashing spectrum.
[01:35:38.594 --> 01:35:40.354]  But that's loving and good.
[01:35:40.354 --> 01:35:53.277]  But when a constitutionalist says support alternative media, boy do the enemies come out and say, how dare you try to be, you know, once a year to build a bigger infrastructure, which we've done, the TV system, all of it.
[01:35:54.605 --> 01:35:57.890]  We want to hire a couple more reporters, some more IT people, and some more equipment.
[01:35:57.890 --> 01:36:00.433]  And boy, that $500,000 if we hit our goal is going to go fast.
[01:36:00.433 --> 01:36:01.054]  But you know what?
[01:36:01.054 --> 01:36:06.782]  We might reach it too just by everybody getting memberships.
[01:36:06.782 --> 01:36:09.626]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a membership, or InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:36:10.786 --> 01:36:16.372]  Or just buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, everything at InfoWars.com or support our sponsors.
[01:36:16.372 --> 01:36:19.194]  That's how this information gets out.
[01:36:19.194 --> 01:36:22.578]  That's how we finance this situation.
[01:36:22.578 --> 01:36:28.243]  Your free will supporting us, not the government taking your money and bailout money and giving it to MSNBC.
[01:36:28.243 --> 01:36:30.505]  Now Max Keiser is coming up in three minutes.
[01:36:30.505 --> 01:36:33.668]  We appreciate him joining us from Paris with the latest on what's really happening.
[01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:37.850]  You know, the devil in the details with this whole EU deal.
[01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:43.352]  They're really giving the bondholders a 50% haircut, which sounds like the right idea.
[01:36:43.352 --> 01:36:44.332]  What's this I read about?
[01:36:44.332 --> 01:36:54.375]  Because they won't give out the full text about grabbing the, quote, insurance on the German pension funds to back it up.
[01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.176]  Some numbers say 500
[01:36:57.048 --> 01:36:59.311]  Billion Euros, others say a trillion.
[01:36:59.311 --> 01:37:01.234]  So it's kind of like the Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:37:01.234 --> 01:37:02.716]  We're not getting the whole thing.
[01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:06.942]  Max Keiser, maxkeiser.com, coming up here in just a moment.
[01:37:06.942 --> 01:37:11.668]  But first, for just a few minutes, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up of Midas Resources.
[01:37:12.569 --> 01:37:14.352]  To give us his view on what's happening.
[01:37:14.352 --> 01:37:19.619]  You know, Ted, the dollar, if we can put this headline up, dollar is plunging against the yen right now.
[01:37:19.619 --> 01:37:22.583]  First it's the euro plunges, and then now the dollar's plunging.
[01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:27.590]  I mean, this is global currency devaluation, and so gold and silver's going up today.
[01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:29.272]  I mean, that's common sense that...
[01:37:29.753 --> 01:37:35.497]  They can knock it down by raising margin calls and margin requirements in the short term, but look at a 12-year graph.
[01:37:35.497 --> 01:37:46.404]  It's only going up, and you're saying in the last month for the first time since you've been in business 30 years in gold and silver, Ted, that your phones are smoking hot even when gold's down.
[01:37:46.404 --> 01:37:49.105]  Now gold's up, and I know they're burning up.
[01:37:49.105 --> 01:37:55.549]  How long can you continue with gold and silver at the prices they were a month ago when you bought that dragon's hoard of gold and silver?
[01:37:55.549 --> 01:37:57.831]  How long till it goes up on the Alex Jones Specials?
[01:37:58.513 --> 01:38:02.998]  Well, I can tell you right now, Alex, I've had such an increase today, and I know where the volume is at.
[01:38:02.998 --> 01:38:07.243]  I'm just not going to be able to hold at least a few of these items after today.
[01:38:07.243 --> 01:38:10.186]  I mean, right now, we have silver at $35.48 at a peak, $35.35 right now, trading currently up $1.88.
[01:38:15.271 --> 01:38:22.714]  Gold is up at $1747.20, seen a high of $1748.30, up $20 for today.
[01:38:22.714 --> 01:38:31.278]  I can tell you, even if you go to my website, right now I have that Campaign for Liberty coin that we've been talking about.
[01:38:31.278 --> 01:38:34.280]  Presently, right now, I have that coin sitting...
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.841]  Oh darn it, I just have to find it right here.
[01:38:36.841 --> 01:38:40.024]  It's on my... 517, there it is right there.
[01:38:40.024 --> 01:38:44.287]  And if you go to the website right now, you're going to find that same exact coin at 523.47.
[01:38:44.287 --> 01:38:51.954]  That silver dollar special that I made an offer for at $73, I can't do it at that tomorrow.
[01:38:51.954 --> 01:38:56.637]  You're going to have to... That's two silver dollars, 73, free shipping, free book, free video.
[01:38:57.418 --> 01:38:58.938]  So, I mean, that's a good deal.
[01:38:58.938 --> 01:39:00.459]  Two silver dollars for 73 bucks.
[01:39:00.459 --> 01:39:01.439]  That's going up tomorrow.
[01:39:01.439 --> 01:39:02.359]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:02.359 --> 01:39:04.759]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:04.759 --> 01:39:20.882]  And I would say it supports the network in my show, but I happen to know that Ted, even though he bought it low and is selling it low when it's high, is making 3-4% profit, which doesn't even keep the lights on up there.
[01:39:20.882 --> 01:39:25.863]  But when you call, these are all lost leaders, a whole list of gold and silver they've got, but it's all running out.
[01:39:26.463 --> 01:39:27.484]  It will go up tomorrow.
[01:39:27.484 --> 01:39:28.664]  You heard Ted.
[01:39:28.664 --> 01:39:31.126]  800-686-2237.
[01:39:31.126 --> 01:39:34.568]  When you call, ask for the Alex Jones specials.
[01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:36.369]  Ted, we keep explaining this to people.
[01:39:36.369 --> 01:39:41.612]  They can short-term drive down gold and silver, but it always beach balls back up, like trying to hold a beach ball underwater.
[01:39:41.612 --> 01:39:43.853]  We'll get Kaiser's breakdown on this in a moment.
[01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:45.434]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[01:39:45.434 --> 01:39:46.675]  But I talked to a lot of yuppies.
[01:39:47.675 --> 01:39:55.580]  I've had distant, not distant, but somewhat distant family you see every few years laugh at me repeatedly, because they always hear about the drive down over the drive up.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.902]  And I go, have you seen a five-year or 10-year graph?
[01:39:58.902 --> 01:40:03.385]  I mean, you know this is the best performing investment, but I don't say buy it for investment.
[01:40:03.385 --> 01:40:06.688]  I say buy it for a hedge against crises.
[01:40:06.688 --> 01:40:07.728]  And I mean, I don't sell gold.
[01:40:07.728 --> 01:40:09.269]  I bought it 300 when it hit 2,000.
[01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.511]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:19.036]  Look, gold isn't perfect, silver isn't perfect, but it's light years ahead of paper currencies, Ted.
[01:40:19.036 --> 01:40:20.357]  It sure is.
[01:40:20.357 --> 01:40:21.758]  And you know what?
[01:40:21.758 --> 01:40:23.680]  The European thing is not solved.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.142]  The United States problems are not solved.
[01:40:26.142 --> 01:40:37.751]  If you see some market manipulation going on because they're raising reserve requirements on trading and so on and so forth, that isn't going to solve the fact that gold and silver is going up because the rest of the world is melting down.
[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:43.252]  Well, all I know is silver's not a silver bullet, but it's as close as you're going to get to a silver bullet.
[01:40:43.252 --> 01:40:45.012]  After all, it's silver.
[01:40:45.012 --> 01:40:48.734]  I mean, a lot of people sit there and they say, well, gold was $300.
[01:40:48.734 --> 01:40:49.654]  I didn't get it.
[01:40:49.654 --> 01:40:50.375]  It was $1,000.
[01:40:50.375 --> 01:40:50.655]  It was $1,500.
[01:40:50.655 --> 01:40:51.715]  It was $1,600, $1,700.
[01:40:51.715 --> 01:40:54.856]  And I didn't get it, so it's just too much now.
[01:40:54.856 --> 01:40:56.897]  Will it be too much if it hits $3,000?
[01:40:56.897 --> 01:40:58.958]  And you wish you got it at $1,600, $1,700.
[01:40:58.958 --> 01:41:00.639]  Will it be too much if it hits $5,000?
[01:41:00.639 --> 01:41:03.140]  We're not happy we're right and this is happening.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.221]  But the dollar is in free fall right now.
[01:41:05.221 --> 01:41:06.541]  And they'll jack it back up again.
[01:41:06.541 --> 01:41:07.302]  It'll fall again.
[01:41:08.596 --> 01:41:11.799]  Overall, it's going down as every other major currency is.
[01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:13.340]  This is global devaluation.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:14.721]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[01:41:14.721 --> 01:41:33.657]  And that's what I want to talk with Max Keiser, commodities trading expert, inventor of the Hollywood Virtual Stock Exchange, a model now used in many of the new systems, a real pioneer, very successful broker, stock broker in his own right, TV host on BBC, RT, Press TV.
[01:41:34.398 --> 01:41:36.539]  I mean, literally the list goes on and on.
[01:41:36.539 --> 01:41:37.519]  He needs no introduction.
[01:41:37.519 --> 01:41:38.279]  Max Keiser.
[01:41:38.279 --> 01:42:00.087]  Max, hearing that introduction there, I mean, I'm seeing all these signs out there where they say all over the world the signal's been given to turn the presses up, and so now there's not even an attempt, is the signaling I'm hearing, to even deny there's global currency devaluation, and that now a race has begun across the world to print as much money as possible.
[01:42:00.087 --> 01:42:00.908]  Is that true?
[01:42:00.908 --> 01:42:03.849]  Have they decided to go ahead and drop the hammer, Max Keiser?
[01:42:05.225 --> 01:42:07.227]  Hey Alex, great to be back on.
[01:42:07.227 --> 01:42:12.131]  Well, the propaganda is really priceless.
[01:42:12.131 --> 01:42:17.855]  The news is that there will be a 50% haircut on the Greek bonds.
[01:42:17.855 --> 01:42:28.885]  But at the same time, they announced a $1 trillion slush fund, which the President of the EU said they're going to expand on the first week to $5 trillion using derivatives.
[01:42:29.925 --> 01:42:33.748]  And so none of these bondholders are going to take any haircut at all.
[01:42:33.748 --> 01:42:38.892]  It's just a matter of moving deck chairs around on the Titanic.
[01:42:38.892 --> 01:42:40.393]  It's pure propaganda.
[01:42:40.393 --> 01:42:54.564]  The net result, as you are alluding to, is that the money supply numbers, the bailout numbers, the open spigot of the global printers is wide open.
[01:42:54.564 --> 01:42:57.687]  And we immediately saw the reaction in gold and silver.
[01:42:57.987 --> 01:43:14.132]  Gold and silver immediately have traded up sharply on the news because they realize that had there been a genuine 50% haircut, you would have seen the stock market go down and gold and silver have gone down because that would have indicated some deflation.
[01:43:14.132 --> 01:43:15.372]  But it's not deflation.
[01:43:15.372 --> 01:43:18.873]  It's propaganda covering massive inflation.
[01:43:19.093 --> 01:43:28.118]  By the way, Max, let me stop you because I'm looking for the mainstream news article where they actually give the type of derivative name and admit one trillion leveraged to five.
[01:43:28.118 --> 01:43:31.419]  I'm digging around for it, but if you can, because this is breaking.
[01:43:31.419 --> 01:43:35.361]  And again, I wanted to this morning, I said get Kaiser because I'm not a professional.
[01:43:35.361 --> 01:43:39.183]  I want to make sure I'm reading this right because the headline says 50 percent haircut.
[01:43:39.183 --> 01:43:43.045]  But then it says we're going to give you a trillion and then five trillion leveraged.
[01:43:43.045 --> 01:43:47.848]  And then I saw in the German parliament yesterday, they said, well,
[01:43:48.408 --> 01:43:54.774]  This is going to be backed up by the German Pension Insurance Fund.
[01:43:54.774 --> 01:43:59.759]  The entity that's pulling the strings here is the IMF.
[01:43:59.759 --> 01:44:04.424]  The IMF a few years ago was bankrupt itself and about to go out of business.
[01:44:04.904 --> 01:44:09.807]  And then suddenly, because of these bailouts, they have a new role to play.
[01:44:09.807 --> 01:44:17.771]  And this new role is going to be as the administrator for the people of Greece, for example.
[01:44:17.771 --> 01:44:25.876]  They're going to have police, actual police, on the streets sent in by the IMF to make sure that people are paying their taxes and people are
[01:44:26.576 --> 01:44:27.157]  I don't think so.
[01:44:46.138 --> 01:44:51.640]  Special drawing rights, which will be another world currency by a world bank.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.881]  And so the individual sovereignty of these countries disappears.
[01:44:54.881 --> 01:44:56.542]  Greece will disappear.
[01:44:56.542 --> 01:44:58.642]  Other countries in the Eurozone disappear.
[01:44:58.642 --> 01:45:02.124]  And of course, this is going to be a phenomenon around the world.
[01:45:02.124 --> 01:45:03.784]  The dollar itself.
[01:45:03.784 --> 01:45:05.285]  This is interesting, though, Alex, is that
[01:45:05.945 --> 01:45:12.309]  As troubling as the situation is in Europe, it's actually better than what we see in the United States.
[01:45:12.309 --> 01:45:17.312]  The United States dollar is really the big loser in this global game.
[01:45:17.312 --> 01:45:34.943]  Okay, I want to break that down, but before I forget to ask, and now they're moving the derivatives, the 79 trillion that they admit they have, into the FDIC protected zone at Bank of America, and the word is from John Williams, William K. Black, I mean, top economist.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:43.545]  I mean, the word is, it is truly a zombie that has run out of brains and is about to die.
[01:45:43.545 --> 01:46:00.579]  Well, it's amazing because during the 2008 crisis, you had an investment bank like Goldman Sachs, which was not considered a bank and not eligible for FDIC insurance because of the advantages they got as a broker-dealer, making a market in securities.
[01:46:00.579 --> 01:46:02.161]  There's a huge benefit in that.
[01:46:02.161 --> 01:46:03.402]  Then once the crisis hit,
[01:46:05.003 --> 01:46:07.685]  They said, oh, now we're a bank.
[01:46:07.685 --> 01:46:11.868]  So all of our bets are now being guaranteed by the U.S.
[01:46:11.868 --> 01:46:13.810]  taxpayer through FDIC.
[01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:19.714]  Now that that cycle is over, they're thinking about, well, maybe we want to be an investment bank again because we want the advantages of being a broker-dealer.
[01:46:19.714 --> 01:46:20.795]  We don't want to be a bank anymore.
[01:46:21.175 --> 01:46:22.877]  Bank of America, the same thing.
[01:46:22.877 --> 01:46:23.898]  They go back and forth.
[01:46:23.898 --> 01:46:28.582]  Merrill Lynch was an investment bank, then it's a commercial bank, now it's back to being an investment bank.
[01:46:28.582 --> 01:46:41.554]  Meanwhile, tens of trillions of dollars worth of bad bets that were cooked up by the bankers during the run-up to the crisis, those are now being moved from the balance sheet of Merrill Lynch, Bank of America,
[01:46:42.174 --> 01:46:44.935]  To the FDIC.
[01:46:44.935 --> 01:46:46.015]  And that means the U.S.
[01:46:46.015 --> 01:46:46.816]  taxpayer.
[01:46:46.816 --> 01:46:48.856]  And how will they pay for those bad bets?
[01:46:48.856 --> 01:47:00.721]  They will inflate the money supply by another 5, 10, 20, 30 trillion dollars, which means gold and silver will continue to go higher and higher as the dollar collapses and all fiat money collapses.
[01:47:00.721 --> 01:47:01.081]  The euro
[01:47:01.701 --> 01:47:25.175]  It's going to collapse as well, but it's not as bad off as the dollar because within the Eurozone you still have Germany, and Germany is the number one export powerhouse in the world, and they are playing a very smart game about keeping the Euro cheap by encouraging default in countries like Greece, at the same time boosting their exports and playing a very cozy relationship with China, and so they're playing this brilliantly.
[01:47:25.175 --> 01:47:29.638]  Germany's playing the best hand in the global financial currency wars right now.
[01:47:31.539 --> 01:47:50.993]  I'm having one of those frustrating moments because I probably had 15 articles about this today, Financial Times, London Guardian, and I didn't circle or highlight it, but I found in several articles, and I'm going to do a report on this later tonight on the nightly news, where it actually said derivatives and gave the name of the type.
[01:47:50.993 --> 01:47:52.554]  Now here in this London Guardian,
[01:47:53.706 --> 01:47:53.986]  I don't know.
[01:48:14.893 --> 01:48:25.763]  And I wanted to get you on to make sure I wasn't crazy, and here you are over there breaking it down, but even when we go to break, come back if you have to, and dig it up during the break.
[01:48:25.763 --> 01:48:29.847]  Because I want to give people the technicals on this, because they are hiding this in plain view.
[01:48:29.847 --> 01:48:36.693]  I'm getting emails saying... Go to Bloomberg, and there's an article called, EU says 50% Greek write-down, 1.4 trillion in fund.
[01:48:39.366 --> 01:48:41.767]  Okay, give that headline one more time.
[01:48:41.767 --> 01:48:43.048]  Bloomberg?
[01:48:43.048 --> 01:48:43.968]  Yeah, go to Bloomberg.
[01:48:43.968 --> 01:48:49.170]  The headline is, EU sets 50% Greek write-down, $1.4 trillion in funds.
[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.711]  Okay, all we need is the first part.
[01:48:50.711 --> 01:48:55.052]  EU sets... 50% Greek write-down.
[01:48:55.052 --> 01:48:59.014]  EU sets 50% EU write-down.
[01:48:59.014 --> 01:49:01.775]  That's it.
[01:49:01.775 --> 01:49:04.156]  EU sets 50% Greek write-down.
[01:49:04.156 --> 01:49:05.056]  Yeah.
[01:49:05.056 --> 01:49:05.397]  That's it.
[01:49:05.397 --> 01:49:05.917]  That's the headline.
[01:49:06.713 --> 01:49:09.835]  Guys, is that Bloomberg or is that San Francisco Chronicle?
[01:49:09.835 --> 01:49:12.837]  That's Bloomberg.com.
[01:49:12.837 --> 01:49:14.018]  Okay, that is Bloomberg.
[01:49:14.018 --> 01:49:14.979]  Okay, we've got it on screen.
[01:49:14.979 --> 01:49:16.700]  Tell us where it's at.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:17.921]  Okay, you see the headline?
[01:49:17.921 --> 01:49:18.981]  Yes.
[01:49:18.981 --> 01:49:21.163]  Okay, go down to the end of the article.
[01:49:21.163 --> 01:49:23.765]  Leverage options.
[01:49:23.765 --> 01:49:25.026]  Under plans to be spelled out.
[01:49:26.487 --> 01:49:32.033]  They go into how they can leverage this fund.
[01:49:32.033 --> 01:49:33.655]  Yeah, but that's what I'm telling you!
[01:49:33.655 --> 01:49:41.023]  I've got two articles in here that I'm unable to find where they actually name the type of derivative and from my memory it's a really nasty one.
[01:49:42.438 --> 01:49:53.043]  Well, credit default swaps, of course, are one of the prime derivatives used to move risk around the global banking system and to increase the leverage of these banks.
[01:49:53.043 --> 01:50:02.106]  But basically, it all comes down to accounting fraud, where they're saying that they've got $1 trillion in fresh capital to bail out these funds.
[01:50:02.106 --> 01:50:06.528]  That $1 trillion has been borrowed from the IMF, effectively.
[01:50:06.528 --> 01:50:10.170]  And the IMF is going to borrow another $5 trillion on top of that.
[01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:13.953]  To increase the indebtedness of the Eurozone.
[01:50:13.953 --> 01:50:27.204]  Yeah, not only, let's explain this, not only will it devalue currency and hurt people that way, but then they're raising taxes to pay the IMF who created the money and who created the Ponzi scheme.
[01:50:27.204 --> 01:50:33.929]  Absolutely, they'll have to raise, the austerity measures will be more severe to pay for this new level of debt.
[01:50:33.929 --> 01:50:34.430]  Absolutely.
[01:50:35.632 --> 01:50:37.236]  Stay there, Max.
[01:50:37.236 --> 01:50:39.020]  He did give us the source.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.383]  I know I've got it in mind.
[01:50:40.383 --> 01:50:44.633]  One of the most frustrating things when I've got just pools of papers blowing around.
[01:50:44.633 --> 01:50:45.655]  I'm gonna dig it out.
[01:50:47.126 --> 01:50:51.269]  Uh, and we're gonna go over that as well, but it even says it's derivatives.
[01:50:51.269 --> 01:50:52.669]  Five trillion dollars!
[01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:54.411]  And by the way, you know the U.S.
[01:50:54.411 --> 01:50:55.811]  has been paying for about half of this.
[01:50:55.811 --> 01:50:57.712]  Federal Reserve ships our money over there.
[01:50:57.712 --> 01:51:00.974]  So when you hear America's in debt, it's to the bankers.
[01:51:00.974 --> 01:51:03.496]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[01:51:03.496 --> 01:51:05.537]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[01:52:12.708 --> 01:52:15.552]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against
[01:52:15.572 --> 01:52:16.033]  I don't know.
[01:52:34.656 --> 01:52:40.797]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:52:40.797 --> 01:52:50.700]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:52.200]  The war is here.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:54.081]  It's an info war.
[01:52:54.081 --> 01:52:56.141]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:18.002]  So we showed you that Bloomberg article where they admit derivatives and digging through here they mentioned them.
[01:54:18.002 --> 01:54:38.532]  I haven't found the articles yet because I read all these this morning and then didn't highlight it where they gave the name of the type of derivative but they admit that it is a credit default swap or the insurance on the guarantee that these bonds will be paid off these new bonds they're issuing to quote entice the Chinese to invest they say is
[01:54:41.823 --> 01:54:42.284]  Yes.
[01:54:54.031 --> 01:54:57.713]  And then another, it goes on to say that it will be leveraged.
[01:54:57.713 --> 01:55:01.094]  And again, we just went over that Bloomberg article.
[01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:11.939]  Here's The Guardian, Europe's leaders are claiming a victory in the Eurozone crisis after agreeing to new deals that slash Greek debt and increase the firepower of the main bailout fund around 1 trillion euros or 872 billion pounds.
[01:55:11.939 --> 01:55:14.481]  And then it goes on, Greece's debt and derivatives.
[01:55:21.764 --> 01:55:29.488]  You know, they're saying 100 billion euros, but then you notice they want 5 trillion for what?
[01:55:29.488 --> 01:55:38.732]  Again, they're telling us it's Greece's fault, and it's all how evil the Greek people are, but it's just like Iceland, where you've been and covered this and predicted, Max, they don't even owe anything!
[01:55:38.732 --> 01:55:39.752]  It's total bull!
[01:55:39.752 --> 01:55:49.037]  Just like we're about to have to bail out 79 trillion, backstop that for Bank of America, and when they're done with it on the news, old ladies will think they're eating dog food because it's their fault, Max!
[01:55:50.387 --> 01:55:52.769]  Just increasing the debt load, okay?
[01:55:52.769 --> 01:55:57.512]  So, if you want to understand derivatives, keep this image in your mind.
[01:55:57.512 --> 01:56:06.899]  Take a dollar bill and walk into a house of mirrors, and you show that dollar bill up to the house of mirrors, and you'll see, oh my god, there's a thousand of these dollar bills.
[01:56:07.119 --> 01:56:09.700]  No, those are mirror reflections of your dollar.
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:10.741]  They're not real.
[01:56:10.741 --> 01:56:11.941]  That's a derivative.
[01:56:11.941 --> 01:56:15.743]  It's the same bet on the same dollar over and over and over again.
[01:56:15.743 --> 01:56:20.486]  And the credit default swap, by the way, is sold as an insurance product.
[01:56:20.486 --> 01:56:23.327]  But there's no collateral backing a credit default swap.
[01:56:23.407 --> 01:56:26.609]  Therefore, by definition, it's not an insurance product.
[01:56:26.609 --> 01:56:43.539]  And if you have an insurance so-called product that is backstopping, let's say, $60 trillion in bank reserves, and that is obviously going to be impossible to honor if you have a systemic banking collapse due to selling credit default swaps.
[01:56:43.539 --> 01:56:46.160]  I did the exact same thing on Wall Street.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.303]  You sell options on the market that you know never will
[01:56:50.583 --> 01:56:56.466]  You'll never have to make good on the options because the company that you're doing this for is about to go bankrupt.
[01:56:56.466 --> 01:56:57.947]  Microsoft does it all the time.
[01:56:57.947 --> 01:57:04.170]  They sell options on their own stock knowing that they can manipulate the stock in ways that they'll never have to honor those options.
[01:57:04.170 --> 01:57:06.091]  Apple Computer has done the same thing.
[01:57:06.091 --> 01:57:13.855]  The options market, the derivatives market, is just a huge market for fraud and for playing manipulative games.
[01:57:13.855 --> 01:57:16.936]  All these major corporations do it and hedge funds do it.
[01:57:16.936 --> 01:57:18.537]  Now we're seeing countries do it.
[01:57:18.917 --> 01:57:30.208]  So now the IMF is encouraging the Central Bank of Greece and Ireland and other European countries to engage in the same fraud that we used to do on Wall Street that's now endemic in the hedge fund industry.
[01:57:30.208 --> 01:57:32.330]  It's now being done on a global basis.
[01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:35.072]  And they know we're waking up, so they're militarizing the police.
[01:57:35.072 --> 01:57:37.034]  I actually saw in the article here what you said.
[01:57:37.034 --> 01:57:40.758]  They're going to have the EU enforce the new VAT on the Greeks.
[01:57:41.278 --> 01:57:46.244]  Literally EU troops making sure because the businesses are revolting and not paying it.
[01:57:46.244 --> 01:57:54.913]  I mean this is really military occupation and now we know what the TSA is trying to take gold and silver or search for it at airports and now they're on the highways.
[01:57:54.913 --> 01:57:56.375]  I mean this is a criminal takeover.
[01:57:57.055 --> 01:57:59.058]  It's a banker occupation.
[01:57:59.058 --> 01:58:03.604]  I call it the global insurrection against a banker occupation.
[01:58:03.604 --> 01:58:06.768]  The bankers are occupying the economy.
[01:58:06.768 --> 01:58:13.316]  And they do it by imposing debt that either A, they fraudulently induce,
[01:58:13.556 --> 01:58:15.718]  As was the case with the mortgage crisis.
[01:58:15.718 --> 01:58:21.182]  And then, of course, Obama gave all those fraudulent inducers of debt immunity.
[01:58:21.182 --> 01:58:29.189]  They're trying to get complete immunity for all the hundreds of billions of dollars of the debt that was sold by Wall Street fraudulently.
[01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:31.931]  Miss-selling broke the law five different ways.
[01:58:31.931 --> 01:58:33.792]  They want a complete immunity from that.
[01:58:33.792 --> 01:58:37.275]  What happens when the president gives Al Capone immunity?
[01:58:37.275 --> 01:58:39.017]  And, well, we'll be right back.

[01:59:56.432 --> 02:00:05.777]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.777 --> 02:00:07.098]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.098 --> 02:00:08.859]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.859 --> 02:00:10.620]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:12.201]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.201 --> 02:00:13.761]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.761 --> 02:00:17.944]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.944 --> 02:00:22.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.393 --> 02:00:30.864]  Well, we're really indebted to Max coming on as a broker, stock exchange system inventor to break down what's happening.
[02:00:30.864 --> 02:00:33.948]  Because, I mean, I'm reading all this in the news, but it's all coded.
[02:00:33.948 --> 02:00:35.370]  They admitted some new derivatives.
[02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:36.853]  It's trillions and trillions between...
[02:00:37.967 --> 02:00:44.270]  Well, it's a trillion plus they didn't leverage up to five trillion and they're saying, yes, Greece, it's your fault, 100 billion.
[02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:47.012]  And then most of that's derivatives that the government signed on to.
[02:00:47.012 --> 02:00:49.873]  Goldman Sachs puts their people in all the government positions.
[02:00:49.873 --> 02:00:51.474]  The IMF, the World Bank do it.
[02:00:51.474 --> 02:00:53.155]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:53.155 --> 02:00:56.636]  We're going to have Max punch out here.
[02:00:56.636 --> 02:00:58.337]  We appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:00:58.337 --> 02:00:59.758]  And then I'll get into all this other news.
[02:00:59.758 --> 02:01:02.119]  And believe me, there's a lot of new breaking stuff here.
[02:01:02.119 --> 02:01:05.701]  But Max, giving you the floor in the last four minutes, we've got here.
[02:01:05.701 --> 02:01:06.822]  Where does it go from here?
[02:01:06.822 --> 02:01:07.022]  I mean,
[02:01:08.343 --> 02:01:25.837]  When tyrants get away with this much and now they're stealing the military pension funds and publicly admitting it and setting up checkpoints and suddenly all these new fines and fees to even have banking and making you go to cashless and Louisiana banning cash sales.
[02:01:26.977 --> 02:01:28.797]  Uh, of any second-hand item.
[02:01:28.797 --> 02:01:32.658]  I mean, my God, we really live in a prison here, and they're just getting started.
[02:01:32.658 --> 02:01:37.999]  I mean, they've got armies of thugs in uniforms just going, we can't wait to gang-rape everybody.
[02:01:37.999 --> 02:01:40.120]  I mean, what do we do?
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:44.021]  Well, a couple of points to follow up on what we've been talking about here.
[02:01:44.021 --> 02:01:56.083]  The president of the Bundesbank said today that these instruments that are being used to leverage this new European fund are similar in design to those that help
[02:01:56.403 --> 02:02:00.047]  To cause the crisis, end quote.
[02:02:00.047 --> 02:02:01.749]  Which is a remarkable admission.
[02:02:01.749 --> 02:02:08.837]  He's saying that the way we're solving this problem is by bringing in the exact same problems that created the problem to begin with.
[02:02:08.837 --> 02:02:12.440]  Now to move on for a second what this means kind of on a bigger picture.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:18.407]  If you increase the debt load in the Eurozone by 5 trillion Euros, and of course that number will
[02:02:18.547 --> 02:02:19.267]  Double and triple.
[02:02:19.267 --> 02:02:31.371]  Remember when TARP came in under Hank Paulson in the Congress, when he got them to sign off on 750 billion in TARP, that quickly became 15 trillion over the following 36 months.
[02:02:31.371 --> 02:02:33.212]  So this 1 trillion euro
[02:02:33.692 --> 02:02:34.273]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:49.887 --> 02:02:52.269]  Or financial Jim Crow laws.
[02:02:52.269 --> 02:02:59.793]  If you're a rich white person, you get, you know, a rich person, let's say, you get interest rates available at 0%.
[02:02:59.793 --> 02:03:05.797]  You can borrow money at 0% or less than 0% if you use interest rate arbitrage and other techniques.
[02:03:05.797 --> 02:03:10.380]  But if you're anyone else in this society, you know, your credit card is 16% or 20%.
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:12.381]  Your payday loans are annualizing at 300%.
[02:03:13.522 --> 02:03:15.264]  This is financial Jim Crow laws.
[02:03:15.264 --> 02:03:17.505]  Remember the Jim Crow laws from the Civil Rights era?
[02:03:17.505 --> 02:03:20.048]  You know, no coloreds here, whites only.
[02:03:20.048 --> 02:03:22.129]  Well, this is the same thing on interest rates.
[02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:25.092]  If you're part of the system, you work at Goldman and J.P.
[02:03:25.092 --> 02:03:28.635]  Morgan, your cost of money is zero or less.
[02:03:28.635 --> 02:03:34.320]  If you're outside of the system, you go to borrow money, it's 16% minimum, going higher.
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:38.402]  And of course people say, well, it's because the rich people never default on their loans.
[02:03:38.402 --> 02:03:42.944]  Which of course is false, because if that were true, they wouldn't be requiring all these bailouts.
[02:03:42.944 --> 02:03:44.445]  They don't pay back their loans.
[02:03:44.445 --> 02:03:48.747]  That's why they're being bailed out in the multi-hundred trillion dollars of bailout money.
[02:03:48.747 --> 02:03:54.450]  In fact, the people who are poor, like the people in India who borrow on micro-lending facilities, they have a 98% payback ratio.
[02:03:56.431 --> 02:03:58.232]  The poor people pay back their loans.
[02:03:58.232 --> 02:04:00.033]  The rich people don't pay back their loans.
[02:04:00.033 --> 02:04:01.774]  It's financial apartheid.
[02:04:01.774 --> 02:04:03.435]  It's a financial Jim Crow law.
[02:04:03.435 --> 02:04:04.256]  My gosh, hold on.
[02:04:04.256 --> 02:04:05.396]  I know I've got callers.
[02:04:05.396 --> 02:04:06.197]  I've got to hold you over.
[02:04:06.197 --> 02:04:06.997]  You're on fire.
[02:04:06.997 --> 02:04:08.478]  I want to give you a few minutes on this side to finish.
[02:04:08.478 --> 02:04:09.699]  Max, if you'll do it.
[02:04:09.699 --> 02:04:12.441]  You're absolutely right, because I've looked at this.
[02:04:12.441 --> 02:04:16.463]  Really rich people brag, oh, taxes are for regular people.
[02:04:16.463 --> 02:04:19.305]  And it's always the rich people that are defaulting and not paying.
[02:04:19.485 --> 02:04:27.912]  In fact, I've seen statistics that the richer you are, the more apt you are to declare bankruptcy or walk away from a mortgage because you're running a scam.
[02:04:27.912 --> 02:04:35.879]  It's a criminal class who's defaulted and having their whore media tell us all this debt is ours when it's these criminals!
[02:04:35.879 --> 02:04:40.062]  And they've literally got brainwashed, militarized police popping up everywhere.
[02:04:40.062 --> 02:04:41.783]  Cops won't respond to crime now.
[02:04:41.783 --> 02:04:44.065]  They're all just literally, give us the taxes.
[02:04:45.346 --> 02:04:52.048]  Just siege forces, drones, weapons, government massing for gang raping, total tyranny, running rampant.
[02:04:52.048 --> 02:05:00.491]  Kaiser, I want you to finish up the point you're making, and I promise I'm going to your calls first, before I get to Napolitano knew about Fast and Furious in 09, breaking at Infowars.com.
[02:05:01.974 --> 02:05:17.451]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:17.451 --> 02:05:21.135]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:22.133 --> 02:05:34.905]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:34.905 --> 02:05:42.172]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:42.853 --> 02:05:53.217]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:05:53.217 --> 02:05:57.139]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[02:06:02.188 --> 02:06:06.894]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:06:06.894 --> 02:06:13.321]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:06:13.321 --> 02:06:15.604]  Number one, study the past.
[02:06:15.604 --> 02:06:18.007]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:06:18.007 --> 02:06:21.731]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:06:22.836 --> 02:06:25.918]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:06:25.918 --> 02:06:29.761]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:06:29.761 --> 02:06:34.805]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:06:34.805 --> 02:06:38.827]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:06:38.827 --> 02:06:42.230]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:06:42.230 --> 02:06:45.872]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:46.713 --> 02:06:51.657]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[02:06:56.261 --> 02:06:58.963]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:01.601 --> 02:07:03.322]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.322 --> 02:07:08.624]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:08.624 --> 02:07:10.164]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:10.164 --> 02:07:18.948]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:19.688 --> 02:07:27.214]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:27.214 --> 02:07:35.220]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:40.463]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:07:40.463 --> 02:07:42.625]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:08:05.987 --> 02:08:10.812]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.812 --> 02:08:12.414]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.414 --> 02:08:13.936]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.936 --> 02:08:18.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:22.205]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.607 --> 02:08:27.730]  Everybody can feel it, but now it's going into higher gear.
[02:08:27.730 --> 02:08:29.731]  The acceleration of tyranny.
[02:08:29.731 --> 02:08:33.634]  All over the world, they're announcing government will just ban any video or website at once.
[02:08:33.634 --> 02:08:34.674]  No judge, no jury.
[02:08:34.674 --> 02:08:36.236]  You don't even know why.
[02:08:36.236 --> 02:08:39.618]  Website's taken.
[02:08:39.618 --> 02:08:49.464]  They're announcing... Again, like it's no big deal in the Associated Press, rogue website bill creates shiny style ban list.
[02:08:49.464 --> 02:08:52.086]  They're announcing citizens will be killed extrajudicially.
[02:08:52.086 --> 02:08:52.987]  No judge, no jury.
[02:08:54.471 --> 02:08:57.940]  Um, the good news is support for the Second Amendment is down an all-time high.
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:59.704]  I'll get to that in a moment after I take calls.
[02:08:59.704 --> 02:09:02.611]  TSA sex toy victim says apology's not enough.
[02:09:02.611 --> 02:09:03.553]  TSA admits they...
[02:09:04.858 --> 02:09:12.461]  They, you know, put the note in there saying, you know, basically that... No, I'm not going to repeat what they said.
[02:09:12.461 --> 02:09:16.743]  Also Napolitano knew about Fast and Furious in 2009.
[02:09:16.743 --> 02:09:18.704]  Of course, they've all perjured themselves.
[02:09:18.704 --> 02:09:24.186]  Of course, the eight federal law enforcement agencies are involved shipping cocaine in and guns out.
[02:09:24.186 --> 02:09:27.187]  They always have, they always will, as long as it's illegal.
[02:09:27.187 --> 02:09:28.468]  These are criminals.
[02:09:28.468 --> 02:09:30.609]  These are brazen mafia lords.
[02:09:32.045 --> 02:09:41.173]  Who do not care and are preparing to start testing, taking over all the communications with the EAS takeover system next month.
[02:09:41.173 --> 02:09:43.075]  I mean, folks, do you understand this isn't a game?
[02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:50.201]  I know this show used to sound radical to new listeners because we weren't that far down the rat hole yet, but I've studied history.
[02:09:50.201 --> 02:09:52.183]  I studied this elite.
[02:09:52.183 --> 02:09:55.325]  These people want to wreck your life.
[02:09:55.325 --> 02:09:57.988]  They want to wreck the economy to take it over like a third world country.
[02:09:58.936 --> 02:10:02.259]  Now finishing up with Max Keiser as he was on a roll breaking down.
[02:10:02.259 --> 02:10:07.784]  Crystallize where we're going and am I right to say we've reached a jump point?
[02:10:07.784 --> 02:10:15.511]  And they're saying that the signal has been sent now, whereas countries were kind of worried about global devaluation of every currency.
[02:10:15.511 --> 02:10:24.919]  Zero Hedge and others are saying now, and we're seeing this day with the dollar plunging, other currencies plunging, that the signal has been given to Zimbabwe, Weimar Republic,
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.842]  Absolutely go hog wild now.
[02:10:27.842 --> 02:10:35.347]  And I guess their answer will then be, steal everything that's left in the hyperinflation because they have first use of the money you were just talking about.
[02:10:35.347 --> 02:10:38.048]  Give everybody else 17, bare minimum.
[02:10:38.048 --> 02:10:40.550]  Some people 60% interest.
[02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:45.153]  You said 300% annual on these little, you know, these little payday loan sharking operations.
[02:10:45.153 --> 02:10:45.854]  It used to be illegal.
[02:10:46.614 --> 02:10:53.385]  And then there'll just be riots, and that's in the IMF plan, to even use that to then clamp down even more!
[02:10:53.385 --> 02:11:00.096]  And this is just the new country, the new world, total third world slavery, with lots of control freaks with machine guns raping our wives.
[02:11:00.096 --> 02:11:01.257]  I mean, that's basically where we're going.
[02:11:02.546 --> 02:11:16.505]  Yeah, I mean just to follow up on this 0% interest rate problem in the economy is that if you're a criminal, your cost of borrowing funds is 0% and if you make a bad bet, you get bailed out.
[02:11:17.466 --> 02:11:22.449]  If you're not a criminal, if you're not a citizen, your cost of borrowing your funds is on a credit card.
[02:11:22.449 --> 02:11:24.851]  We know it's 16-17% goes higher.
[02:11:24.851 --> 02:11:39.520]  The mortgage rates could be higher, but of course the housing market collapsed and will continue to collapse because of all of the shenanigans going on with the banking system that is destroying the value of assets across the board, except for precious metals, of course.
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:44.022]  So, I'm going to be in Limerick, Ireland next week
[02:11:45.043 --> 02:11:52.214]  And I'm accepting an award from Limerick University for financial journalism for my work in exposing financial terrorism.
[02:11:52.214 --> 02:11:59.985]  And I tell you, the first to know, that my speech will be on the subject of expanding and amending the Patriot Act.
[02:12:00.706 --> 02:12:09.429]  To include financial terrorism acts, and to include people like Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon in the Patriot Act as financial terrorists.
[02:12:09.429 --> 02:12:11.510]  That we need to expand the definition.
[02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:19.352]  If we're going to have a death penalty in America, like we do in Texas, we need to apply equally amongst all categories of harsh criminals.
[02:12:19.352 --> 02:12:23.614]  From the guys in Texas who are caught stealing a hubcap,
[02:12:23.874 --> 02:12:26.036]  To a financial terrorist on Wall Street.
[02:12:26.036 --> 02:12:34.766]  The law must be applied equally and we start this by amending the Patriot Act to include financial terrorism along with other definitions of terrorism.
[02:12:34.766 --> 02:12:41.012]  This will be the subject of my speech to Limerick University next week when I pick up my award for financial journalism.
[02:12:41.012 --> 02:12:41.393]  From that...
[02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:45.216]  University for my work exposing financial terrorism.
[02:12:45.216 --> 02:12:46.837]  Financial terrorism is real, Alex.
[02:12:46.837 --> 02:12:49.258]  It's not a metaphor.
[02:12:49.258 --> 02:12:49.799]  No, I know.
[02:12:49.799 --> 02:12:50.719]  This is their program.
[02:12:50.719 --> 02:13:05.230]  They admittedly, what was it, 2002, all those IMF World Bank documents got leaked, how they were consciously doing this in the third world, how they plan to do it here, how they've done it in Nigeria, Argentina, places like that, how they were getting ready to do it here.
[02:13:05.230 --> 02:13:06.451]  But in closing, Max,
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:10.322]  This is financial terrorism.
[02:13:10.322 --> 02:13:12.184]  These are terrorists.
[02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:19.092]  And if you pull up the BBC from, I think it was like January of this year, it had the quote of the head of the Irish Central Bank.
[02:13:19.092 --> 02:13:20.814]  In fact, guys, you used to find that really easy.
[02:13:20.814 --> 02:13:26.800]  The last few times, I don't know if you haven't looked or you haven't found it, but just try, but the exact quote is,
[02:13:28.481 --> 02:13:34.002]  Head of Irish Central Bank, it's good to have foreign banks run Ireland.
[02:13:34.002 --> 02:13:36.563]  And it was actually a clip too, that's why they quoted him.
[02:13:36.563 --> 02:13:41.223]  And he said, it's wonderful we're signing on to global debt, we'll have foreign banks run us now.
[02:13:41.223 --> 02:13:47.745]  It's kind of like saying it's good to throw children into shark tanks or into pits of pit bulls.
[02:13:47.745 --> 02:13:55.106]  It's good to put children in, live children in meat grinders and turn them into hamburger meat.
[02:13:56.027 --> 02:13:58.610]  You know, it's good to shoot old ladies in the head.
[02:13:58.610 --> 02:14:06.218]  I mean, it's like this trance where they just throw out incredible stuff right in front of us and say, Greece, it's your fault.
[02:14:06.218 --> 02:14:10.042]  We're getting five trillion now and Greece doesn't even owe anything.
[02:14:10.703 --> 02:14:18.229]  I mean, it's just the Svengali, mind control, bizarreness of it, Max.
[02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:19.830]  Like, when does it end?
[02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:21.071]  How far does it go?
[02:14:21.071 --> 02:14:35.783]  I mean, even as it destroys our world, consolidates power with the bankers, and even as cops lose their whole future, and the military, and even a lot of military I've talked to are awake, they'll still follow orders to literally do whatever they're told, and they're going to use them domestically.
[02:14:35.783 --> 02:14:38.285]  I mean, we are entering into absolute hell.
[02:14:39.406 --> 02:14:43.789]  Look, there's a rule in economics, the Law of Diminishing Returns.
[02:14:43.789 --> 02:14:52.376]  For 20 or 30 years, America's GDP would grow, even though the level of debt was also growing.
[02:14:52.376 --> 02:14:58.360]  Until 2007, 2008, when that equation stopped.
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:03.924]  The debt kept keeps improving and keeps going up, but the GDP has stalled out.
[02:15:03.924 --> 02:15:05.626]  So, American economy
[02:15:06.386 --> 02:15:09.148]  Has reached the endgame in terms of growth.
[02:15:09.148 --> 02:15:17.314]  So what's happening is that the elites are grabbing as much as they possibly can before the ultimate collapse.
[02:15:17.314 --> 02:15:21.858]  And it's like... And building armored compounds all over the world publicly.
[02:15:21.858 --> 02:15:25.801]  While telling cops we're kooks if we try to get ready.
[02:15:26.747 --> 02:15:28.568]  It's looting.
[02:15:28.568 --> 02:15:30.908]  It's the people living on Park Avenue and work on Wall Street.
[02:15:30.908 --> 02:15:36.750]  They are looting the system for everything they can because they know it's about to collapse.
[02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:41.472]  And they keep interest rates at 0% to enable them to loot more quicker.
[02:15:42.012 --> 02:15:45.075]  And everyone else is going to be left holding the bag.
[02:15:45.075 --> 02:15:51.381]  And as you said, it's all conscious because they started setting up the police grids, the takeover grids when they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[02:15:51.381 --> 02:15:52.662]  They have a plan.
[02:15:52.662 --> 02:15:57.467]  This is premeditated, on purpose, as they say in post-industrial society.
[02:15:57.967 --> 02:16:02.309]  The plan is not to reverse the problems.
[02:16:02.309 --> 02:16:10.973]  You could reverse the situation by raising interest rates and weeding out the speculators, as Paul Volcker did in the 70s and early 80s.
[02:16:10.973 --> 02:16:14.674]  That would cure the American economy of its speculator problem.
[02:16:14.674 --> 02:16:20.957]  But that's not going to happen because the speculators have their boy in place, Ben Bernanke, who's going to keep interest rates at zero.
[02:16:20.957 --> 02:16:21.897]  How far will they go?
[02:16:21.897 --> 02:16:26.219]  I mean, just when everything's completely wrecked and they don't even care and they're behind armored compounds?
[02:16:26.579 --> 02:16:29.761]  I mean, really, they just want to wreck everything.
[02:16:29.761 --> 02:16:34.865]  I mean, what are they going to do with their trillions of stolen stuff if it won't buy anything and the country's on fire?
[02:16:35.936 --> 02:16:39.537]  Well, they are what I call suicide bankers.
[02:16:39.537 --> 02:16:44.058]  They're no different than suicide bombers in Tel Aviv or somewhere else.
[02:16:44.058 --> 02:16:46.339]  They have an ideology that they believe in.
[02:16:46.339 --> 02:16:49.360]  The sanctity of making money at any cost.
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:51.640]  And they're willing to kill themselves and others to do it.
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:17:01.283]  And my story that I tell often about the broker who was in the building south tower of 9-11, who stayed behind to trade options on airline flights instead of saving himself.
[02:17:02.023 --> 02:17:03.864]  After the first tower went down.
[02:17:03.864 --> 02:17:06.145]  That's a typical suicide broker in America.
[02:17:06.145 --> 02:17:08.506]  That's the story of American finance right there.
[02:17:08.506 --> 02:17:09.787]  Stay behind trade options.
[02:17:09.787 --> 02:17:11.767]  That guy made five million dollars, by the way.
[02:17:11.767 --> 02:17:14.068]  It's still in a bank account for Deutsche Bank, Alex Brown.
[02:17:14.068 --> 02:17:15.469]  I used to work at Alex Brown.
[02:17:15.469 --> 02:17:16.710]  It's never been collected.
[02:17:16.710 --> 02:17:19.491]  He made five million, but he died.
[02:17:19.491 --> 02:17:21.832]  And that's American finance in a nutshell.
[02:17:21.832 --> 02:17:22.672]  But he didn't care.
[02:17:22.672 --> 02:17:26.414]  I mean, he wanted that cash even though he was going to die.
[02:17:26.914 --> 02:17:28.535]  He's a suicide banker!
[02:17:28.535 --> 02:17:34.660]  He's gonna make five million dollars and kill himself just like a suicide bomber because he believes in the sanctity of making money.
[02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:44.927]  His life is not worth the same as making the money for his ideology of Wall Street, of psychopathy, of Wall Street, of making money and kill yourself and everyone around you.
[02:17:44.927 --> 02:17:45.888]  That's what we're dealing with.
[02:17:47.904 --> 02:17:49.765]  It's the same thing with the bureaucrats, too.
[02:17:49.765 --> 02:17:52.807]  All right, Max, we're going to go to break and come back with calls.
[02:17:52.807 --> 02:17:56.890]  I want to talk to you, maybe from Ireland, via video Skype.
[02:17:56.890 --> 02:18:00.512]  Take your laptop over.
[02:18:00.512 --> 02:18:03.494]  Very exciting having you on, and we appreciate you.
[02:18:03.494 --> 02:18:05.155]  I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel, though.
[02:18:08.459 --> 02:18:19.659]  Well, I mean, the Democrats have gone from trying to praise Occupy Wall Street, trying to take it over, to now having cops rubber bullet veterans in the face for no reason, and now they're demonizing it, showing they failed to really take it over.
[02:18:21.092 --> 02:18:23.934]  Look, it's basically every man for themselves.
[02:18:23.934 --> 02:18:36.503]  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but everyone has to decide for themselves what's best for them, because the system's collapsing, the dollar's collapsing, fiat money's collapsing.
[02:18:36.503 --> 02:18:45.870]  Gold and silver, of course, are going to do well, but you have to be careful because ETFs are a problem, safe deposit boxes are a problem, keeping it in your home is a problem.
[02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:47.832]  So you have to be aware of all these things.
[02:18:47.832 --> 02:18:48.332]  No, no, no.
[02:18:48.332 --> 02:18:49.674]  We got rid of the Constitution.
[02:18:49.674 --> 02:18:50.855]  We got rid of freedom.
[02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:52.757]  People thought it was a stupid, quaint thing.
[02:18:52.757 --> 02:18:55.960]  And, you know, we let the criminals sweet-talk us.
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.321]  And now all the blessing's gone.
[02:18:57.321 --> 02:18:59.583]  All the protection's gone.
[02:18:59.583 --> 02:19:00.804]  All the good things are gone.
[02:19:00.804 --> 02:19:04.148]  And now we get to live just like they do in a third-world country.
[02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:10.894]  Yes, millions of people, instead of thinking every morning when they wake up, gee, how can I do a good job and improve the GDP?
[02:19:10.894 --> 02:19:15.896]  They think, how can I save myself from this kleptocratic nightmare that has destroyed my country?
[02:19:15.896 --> 02:19:19.498]  And they spend their entire day thinking about that instead of doing something productive.
[02:19:19.498 --> 02:19:27.303]  And that's what they want, because the sooner these people end up in a privately controlled and operated and owned prison, the more money they make.
[02:19:27.303 --> 02:19:32.966]  Corrections Corps of America, the biggest prison operator in America, and America has the biggest prison population in the world,
[02:19:33.166 --> 02:19:34.007]  Bigger than China.
[02:19:34.007 --> 02:19:35.228]  Bigger than India.
[02:19:35.228 --> 02:19:36.809]  Is run by private corporations.
[02:19:36.809 --> 02:19:37.589]  For profit.
[02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:40.391]  And they get laws changed to put more people in prison.
[02:19:40.391 --> 02:19:41.352]  They own the prison.
[02:19:41.352 --> 02:19:42.333]  They own the restaurants.
[02:19:42.333 --> 02:19:43.193]  They own it all.
[02:19:43.193 --> 02:19:52.340]  And they say they want a neo-feudal system where they're gonna be on giant high-tech armored fortresses and we are literally running around in a desert road warrior scenario.
[02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:54.882]  That is the scientific globalist plan.
[02:19:54.882 --> 02:19:56.023]  And they're gonna carry it out.
[02:19:56.663 --> 02:19:57.924]  Alex, here's the good news.
[02:19:57.924 --> 02:20:00.185]  They're going to make online poker legal.
[02:20:00.185 --> 02:20:01.426]  Oh, everything's wonderful.
[02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:05.249]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[02:20:05.249 --> 02:20:06.429]  Then stop!
[02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:09.871]  Stop buying metal lids and get Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:20:09.871 --> 02:20:16.976]  Made of USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, Tattler Canning Lids let you safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.

[02:20:46.933 --> 02:20:47.513]  The original since 1976.
[02:21:01.138 --> 02:21:02.438]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.438 --> 02:21:08.020]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:13.042]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:21:13.042 --> 02:21:18.084]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:21:18.604 --> 02:21:23.846]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:21:23.846 --> 02:21:26.147]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:21:26.147 --> 02:21:30.949]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:32.069]  And here's the best part.
[02:21:32.069 --> 02:21:35.131]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:21:35.131 --> 02:21:38.432]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:21:38.752 --> 02:21:41.936]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:41.936 --> 02:21:44.158]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:21:45.119 --> 02:21:45.359]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:45.359 --> 02:21:48.743]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:21:48.743 --> 02:21:50.485]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:26.815]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.

[02:23:07.982 --> 02:23:22.866]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:23:23.286 --> 02:23:25.208]  In all, at least 68 diseases.
[02:23:25.208 --> 02:23:29.794]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production?
[02:23:29.794 --> 02:23:33.258]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:33.258 --> 02:23:36.882]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein.
[02:23:36.882 --> 02:23:40.567]  All other whey protein powders are damaged by heat, chemicals and filtration.
[02:23:41.187 --> 02:23:43.448]  Okay, I'm going to your calls, but that Kaiser info was important.
[02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:43.928]  Let's go to Sam.
[02:24:13.136 --> 02:24:19.823]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:24:19.823 --> 02:24:22.425]  Good afternoon.
[02:24:22.425 --> 02:24:26.689]  Well, I just want to make a couple quick comments.
[02:24:26.689 --> 02:24:32.254]  I've been holding for a little while, and you've been making great points, and I have just a few comments.
[02:24:32.254 --> 02:24:32.715]  First one,
[02:24:33.308 --> 02:24:55.889]  About the whole cancer thing, there's a great guy in your state of Texas by the name of Dr. Brzezinski and he's doing groundbreaking things in the fight against cancer and he's just in his FDA clinical trials and people should look him up if they're interested in a real progressive step towards the cure for cancer.
[02:24:55.889 --> 02:24:56.490]  Second point,
[02:24:57.399 --> 02:25:02.281]  I heard you say that, you know, you have a ton of this information and you wish you can get it out to people.
[02:25:02.281 --> 02:25:03.541]  I just want to commend you.
[02:25:03.541 --> 02:25:04.742]  You are.
[02:25:04.742 --> 02:25:08.203]  You're making a huge difference every day, every hour.
[02:25:08.203 --> 02:25:10.544]  There's people telling other people.
[02:25:10.544 --> 02:25:14.385]  And this really goes out to all the info warriors listening.
[02:25:14.385 --> 02:25:16.146]  We gotta support Alex.
[02:25:16.146 --> 02:25:22.028]  There's nobody else out there really taking it to the globalist the way he is.
[02:25:22.028 --> 02:25:24.049]  He's putting himself completely out there.
[02:25:24.724 --> 02:25:26.286]  There's millions of us out there.
[02:25:26.286 --> 02:25:27.307]  Everybody listening.
[02:25:27.307 --> 02:25:28.569]  Go to the website.
[02:25:28.569 --> 02:25:29.430]  Get something.
[02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:30.431]  A bumper sticker.
[02:25:30.431 --> 02:25:33.014]  Doesn't matter if it's $3 or $20.
[02:25:33.014 --> 02:25:34.216]  I don't care.
[02:25:34.216 --> 02:25:39.362]  If all of us do it, we put Alex in a position to go nationwide.
[02:25:39.362 --> 02:25:40.864]  Maybe on a major network.
[02:25:40.864 --> 02:25:41.805]  Who knows?
[02:25:41.805 --> 02:25:43.347]  Well, that's what's happening already, sir.
[02:25:43.347 --> 02:25:44.168]  We're already reaching...
[02:25:45.925 --> 02:25:52.391]  Literally, no exaggeration, upwards of 15 million people a week, sir.
[02:25:52.391 --> 02:25:55.734]  And it's growing exponentially.
[02:25:55.734 --> 02:26:02.079]  And people are only now really starting to realize this show isn't extreme.
[02:26:02.079 --> 02:26:04.081]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:26:04.081 --> 02:26:06.223]  But we don't have the big globalist funding.
[02:26:06.223 --> 02:26:13.269]  We reach, for the amount of money we have, more than any other media outlet you're going to find out there, except for something like Drudge Report.
[02:26:14.256 --> 02:26:23.766]  I mean, we reach millions and millions and millions of people a day with hardcore info that is really changing the course of things.
[02:26:23.766 --> 02:26:28.651]  And you're right, sir, when our listeners spread the word and that's what's happening, it is exponential.
[02:26:28.651 --> 02:26:31.634]  And it pushes me into very dangerous territory, but I don't care.
[02:26:31.634 --> 02:26:32.855]  There is no future.
[02:26:35.043 --> 02:26:39.024]  Thank me all the time for standing up against the globalists saying, wow, they're dangerous.
[02:26:39.024 --> 02:26:39.824]  They could come after you.
[02:26:39.824 --> 02:26:40.884]  Look at how they demonize you.
[02:26:40.884 --> 02:26:43.585]  Look at all the trolls they have attacking you.
[02:26:43.585 --> 02:26:45.365]  Folks, I'm going to say it again.
[02:26:45.365 --> 02:26:52.987]  The government has been caught, and we've done news reports on this, putting cancer viruses and sterilants in vaccines.
[02:26:52.987 --> 02:26:55.687]  The government is not the government now.
[02:26:55.687 --> 02:26:58.348]  The government is a bunch of crazy control freak killers.
[02:26:59.375 --> 02:26:59.735]  Okay.
[02:26:59.735 --> 02:27:03.839]  In fact, I need to get to these quotes here, or at least a little nightly news tonight.
[02:27:03.839 --> 02:27:07.421]  The point is that there's no future.
[02:27:07.421 --> 02:27:12.706]  It's not, it's like a wildfire and you live in the forest coming towards your cabin.
[02:27:12.706 --> 02:27:20.051]  You're not full of courage because you try to do something about it or get, you know, get out from its path.
[02:27:20.051 --> 02:27:22.933]  I mean, but see, I can't get out of this thing's path.
[02:27:22.933 --> 02:27:23.634]  I got to fight it.
[02:27:25.842 --> 02:27:27.523]  It's an illusion!
[02:27:27.523 --> 02:27:31.226]  So many people think they're on the winning team serving this evil.
[02:27:31.226 --> 02:27:34.809]  And they don't understand they're being attacked by it as well.
[02:27:34.809 --> 02:27:37.471]  I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:27:37.471 --> 02:27:39.993]  My last point is very simple.
[02:27:39.993 --> 02:27:45.738]  Something as great as the Constitution doesn't happen often.
[02:27:45.738 --> 02:27:51.703]  It never happened before where everyone has the same basic rights.
[02:27:52.648 --> 02:27:53.929]  It'll never happen again.
[02:27:53.929 --> 02:27:57.030]  We have to protect it with everything.
[02:27:57.030 --> 02:28:04.715]  People need to understand that these people, the globalists that have this money, everyone thinks it's so complex.
[02:28:04.715 --> 02:28:06.076]  It's a simple answer.
[02:28:06.076 --> 02:28:07.797]  They want to get caught.
[02:28:07.797 --> 02:28:10.538]  Like a psychopathic serial killer.
[02:28:10.538 --> 02:28:15.681]  They just want to see how much they can get away with before we finally say we had enough.
[02:28:15.681 --> 02:28:19.203]  And the numbers, the numbers are on our side.
[02:28:20.404 --> 02:28:21.425]  They're outnumbered.
[02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:22.525]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:28:22.525 --> 02:28:29.468]  And that's why they're hoping that their technology is going to save them from the numbers, but it won't.
[02:28:29.468 --> 02:28:31.709]  And ultimately, they're like a spoiled child.
[02:28:31.709 --> 02:28:34.550]  They just need to get disciplined.
[02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:37.091]  They could have played their cards completely different.
[02:28:37.091 --> 02:28:41.413]  They could have been leaders of the world, giving out
[02:28:42.748 --> 02:28:55.872]  They could have been leaders in bringing humans to the next level, but again, ruthless manipulators who are jealous got in control, and so they use it all to bring society down.
[02:28:55.872 --> 02:29:03.654]  And that's why all that evil men and tyrants seem to flourish is that good men and women do nothing, as the founders said.
[02:29:03.654 --> 02:29:05.854]  And look, evil is going to be evil.
[02:29:05.854 --> 02:29:10.896]  And when good doesn't take control of society and the culture, what takes
[02:29:12.162 --> 02:29:13.603]  Place in the vacuum.
[02:29:13.603 --> 02:29:15.385]  The worst of the worst get in.
[02:29:15.385 --> 02:29:18.928]  Because the evil's all fighting with itself to get in those positions.
[02:29:18.928 --> 02:29:27.995]  That's one of the few things that holds back total satanic dominion on this planet is that so many of the minions fight with each other.
[02:29:27.995 --> 02:29:32.078]  But that's why they're going to computers so that humans can't make decisions.
[02:29:32.078 --> 02:29:34.640]  A casual society tells you what to do.
[02:29:35.848 --> 02:29:43.577]  So that they can program it, and then through reward and punishment, carrot and stick, control all their minions.
[02:29:43.577 --> 02:29:49.303]  That's why they seek to make you an evil person, to love torture, evil, so you can be their slave.
[02:29:49.303 --> 02:29:50.564]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.564 --> 02:29:54.488]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.488 --> 02:29:57.151]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.255 --> 02:30:02.436]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:02.436 --> 02:30:09.380]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:11.922]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:11.922 --> 02:30:17.305]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.305 --> 02:30:20.347]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.347 --> 02:30:22.408]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.668 --> 02:30:28.913]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:28.913 --> 02:30:32.295]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.295 --> 02:30:38.080]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:39.721]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.721 --> 02:30:41.022]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:41.022 --> 02:30:43.684]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.684 --> 02:30:45.105]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:30:45.365 --> 02:30:47.908]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:47.908 --> 02:30:52.533]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:52.533 --> 02:30:55.116]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:55.116 --> 02:30:58.980]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.001]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.

[02:31:03.504 --> 02:31:15.794]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoods Direct, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[02:31:15.794 --> 02:31:22.960]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:27.282]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:27.282 --> 02:31:29.623]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[02:31:29.623 --> 02:31:34.665]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[02:31:34.665 --> 02:31:35.305]  A $259 value for only $199.

[02:31:37.506 --> 02:31:39.667]  Call 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[02:31:39.667 --> 02:31:40.807]  And go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:31:40.807 --> 02:31:41.267]  Call 24 hours, 800-409-5633.
[02:31:53.052 --> 02:31:53.533]  We're good.
[02:32:02.139 --> 02:32:06.143]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.143 --> 02:32:09.406]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.406 --> 02:32:14.190]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:20.596]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.596 --> 02:32:22.839]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.359 --> 02:32:23.659]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.659 --> 02:32:23.939]  Bernanke?
[02:32:23.939 --> 02:32:24.540]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.540 --> 02:32:25.300]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:26.982]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.273 --> 02:32:44.396]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:44.396 --> 02:32:49.562]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.562 --> 02:32:58.672]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:23.221 --> 02:33:24.962]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:24.962 --> 02:33:27.923]  You are not going to run from the New World Order.
[02:33:27.923 --> 02:33:31.585]  I'm sad to have to report that to you.
[02:33:31.585 --> 02:33:37.348]  The globalists made the decision over a hundred years ago to make a scientific absolute tyranny
[02:33:38.885 --> 02:33:44.792]  Really about 140 years ago, they put out the prospectus in Germany, in England, in the US.
[02:33:44.792 --> 02:33:45.593]  This is all on record.
[02:33:45.593 --> 02:33:48.516]  My film, Endgame, covers it.
[02:33:48.516 --> 02:33:53.582]  And they said, we've got to set this up.
[02:33:53.582 --> 02:33:56.906]  And they went to their scientists, and the scientists all came back and said,
[02:33:57.970 --> 02:34:04.676]  Well, if you're willing to do it, and you are, your highness, or your robber baroness, you are supreme.
[02:34:04.676 --> 02:34:07.838]  As the elites always believed, your blood is superior.
[02:34:07.838 --> 02:34:10.420]  We will discover the essence of your superiority.
[02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:18.087]  And we will set up a scientific mechanism to control mankind.
[02:34:19.657 --> 02:34:30.814]  I say 140 years ago, 200-and-something Malthus said we'll put people in compact little cities and hopefully spread diseases in and kill them.
[02:34:30.814 --> 02:34:32.156]  So it's older than that.
[02:34:32.156 --> 02:34:34.599]  French and Indian War, the British, the manuals are public.
[02:34:35.759 --> 02:34:40.484]  I've actually, I think it was the Smithsonian, I saw a copy of one of those when I was a kid and they just mentioned it in the tour guide.
[02:34:40.484 --> 02:34:42.165]  It was one of the British manuals.
[02:34:42.165 --> 02:34:52.075]  In this manual, as you see, they talk about the smallpox blankets and the best way to treat the soldiers by lancing the boils and then place the fresh... the fresh...
[02:34:53.892 --> 02:34:54.733]  I don't know.
[02:35:09.193 --> 02:35:11.435]  And what is new is really old.
[02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:17.479]  There's nothing new under the sun, just different higher variants of it, or lower, depending on how you look at it.
[02:35:17.479 --> 02:35:26.645]  And every culture, generally, if they knew what they were doing, would just go into a territory and not interbreed with the group, even if they were genetically similar.
[02:35:26.645 --> 02:35:28.627]  They would just kill everybody.
[02:35:28.627 --> 02:35:30.348]  Kill everybody.
[02:35:30.348 --> 02:35:34.911]  A lot of cultures said, don't even keep the kids, don't even try to retrain them, kill them.
[02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:38.361]  Kill them all.
[02:35:38.361 --> 02:35:40.022]  In fact, kill all their animals.
[02:35:40.022 --> 02:35:41.163]  The Israelites would do that.
[02:35:41.163 --> 02:35:44.125]  They would kill all the animals as well.
[02:35:44.125 --> 02:35:45.226]  We don't even want your donkey.
[02:35:45.226 --> 02:35:47.808]  We don't even want your horse, your cow.
[02:35:47.808 --> 02:35:52.791]  The Romans, they had a saying in Latin, before the ram hits the wall.
[02:35:52.791 --> 02:35:54.032]  Guys, I can't remember it in Latin.
[02:35:54.032 --> 02:35:58.375]  Will you look up, before the ram hits the wall?
[02:36:00.539 --> 02:36:04.902]  And then put it up on screen and I can give people the Latin translation of that.
[02:36:04.902 --> 02:36:19.671]  The Romans would say, you 100% give up and put up with what we do before the ram hits the wall, or once the ram hits the wall, we are not going to stop and we're going to kill everybody.
[02:36:19.671 --> 02:36:24.574]  And then a lot of times, because they'd seen the last 50 cities burned, or villages,
[02:36:25.734 --> 02:36:29.299]  They would, the men would come out and they'd say, alright, stand right there.
[02:36:29.299 --> 02:36:31.563]  Your wives and kids are going to roam, but at least they're going to live.
[02:36:31.563 --> 02:36:36.070]  They'd take that sword and ram it straight down, right here by the neck, through the ribcage and the heart.
[02:36:36.070 --> 02:36:36.971]  We'll make it quick.
[02:36:36.971 --> 02:36:38.233]  Good job, you made the right decision.
[02:36:38.233 --> 02:36:39.695]  Get over here!
[02:36:40.956 --> 02:36:42.237]  That's savageness.
[02:36:42.237 --> 02:36:44.460]  That's what humanity does.
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:45.441]  And we're all naive.
[02:36:45.441 --> 02:36:47.303]  Oh, the TSA's here to save me.
[02:36:47.303 --> 02:36:48.384]  Oh, the chemtrails.
[02:36:48.384 --> 02:36:49.005]  Oh, the drones.
[02:36:49.005 --> 02:36:49.726]  They want to be my friend.
[02:36:49.726 --> 02:36:51.267]  No, they don't want to be the friend.
[02:36:51.267 --> 02:36:59.797]  They don't send a Roman soldier in there to take a big short sword and just go, yeah, right into your heart, quickest way in.
[02:36:59.797 --> 02:37:00.457]  They don't do that.
[02:37:01.218 --> 02:37:02.439]  They soft kill you.
[02:37:02.439 --> 02:37:06.322]  They give you a shot that's gonna start killing you young.
[02:37:06.322 --> 02:37:11.266]  Some people are weaker, so they die when they're a kid, but normally it's meant to kill you when you're in your 40s or 50s.
[02:37:11.266 --> 02:37:18.191]  Get some work out of you, get you in debt, and then suck the money out of you and your family as they kill you with cancer.
[02:37:18.191 --> 02:37:20.933]  And a little adult doctor is compartmentalized.
[02:37:20.933 --> 02:37:22.354]  He could never believe this.
[02:37:22.354 --> 02:37:25.036]  He's been domesticated for 50, 60 years.
[02:37:25.036 --> 02:37:26.617]  Why, America's the good guys.
[02:37:26.617 --> 02:37:27.678]  It couldn't do wrong.
[02:37:27.678 --> 02:37:28.639]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:37:30.802 --> 02:37:32.844]  It's a Latin translation.
[02:37:32.844 --> 02:37:34.506]  I just put in before the ram hits the wall.
[02:37:34.506 --> 02:37:38.009]  Watch this.
[02:37:38.009 --> 02:37:39.730]  Yeah, yeah, it's exactly.
[02:37:39.730 --> 02:37:43.194]  It's before the rams touch the wall, then no mercy.
[02:37:43.194 --> 02:37:46.917]  Yeah, that's what it calculates out to.
[02:37:46.917 --> 02:37:47.698]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:37:47.698 --> 02:37:49.620]  The ram hit the wall a long time ago.
[02:37:50.754 --> 02:37:52.375]  And our people are dying.
[02:37:52.375 --> 02:37:54.996]  Cancer is just epidemic.
[02:37:54.996 --> 02:37:56.616]  Every other disease epidemic.
[02:37:56.616 --> 02:37:57.477]  Death everywhere.
[02:37:57.477 --> 02:37:58.477]  Almost everyone I know.
[02:37:58.477 --> 02:38:01.278]  Some of them have, all their friends have cancer.
[02:38:01.278 --> 02:38:06.520]  I was talking to a lady from Germany last night.
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:07.681]  Came in to visit Erin.
[02:38:07.681 --> 02:38:09.942]  She said everybody, I mean almost everybody she knows has cancer.
[02:38:09.942 --> 02:38:12.243]  Young people.
[02:38:12.243 --> 02:38:15.684]  Murim, Eris, a tidget.
[02:38:15.684 --> 02:38:16.965]  The ram has touched the wall.
[02:38:16.965 --> 02:38:19.826]  Romans had a policy that held that once an assault had begun,
[02:38:21.303 --> 02:38:23.484]  Except no mercy or quarter.
[02:38:23.484 --> 02:38:28.225]  The ram touching the wall referred to the battering ram in an assault.
[02:38:28.225 --> 02:38:31.026]  Take it to mean grant no mercy.
[02:38:31.026 --> 02:38:35.608]  In every culture, this is how it's handled.
[02:38:35.608 --> 02:38:38.549]  The men are killed, the women and children taken into bondage.
[02:38:38.549 --> 02:38:42.470]  In a lot of cultures, they just kill everybody.
[02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:47.332]  Cultures that want to absolutely keep their culture, they kill everybody.
[02:38:47.332 --> 02:38:49.193]  Everybody.
[02:38:49.193 --> 02:38:49.633]  Everybody.
[02:38:51.491 --> 02:38:53.057]  Everybody.
[02:38:53.057 --> 02:38:54.021]  All of them.
[02:38:54.021 --> 02:38:54.403]  Dead.
[02:38:54.403 --> 02:38:55.688]  That's endgame.
[02:38:55.688 --> 02:38:56.511]  That's New World Order.
[02:38:58.217 --> 02:38:59.477]  They're not going to give you quarter.
[02:38:59.477 --> 02:39:00.998]  They're not asking you for anything.
[02:39:00.998 --> 02:39:01.778]  They don't want anything.
[02:39:01.778 --> 02:39:04.899]  They're going to kill you and suck your energy out of you while they're killing you.
[02:39:04.899 --> 02:39:07.420]  And they kill you slow and as painful as possible.
[02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:10.761]  Because, unlike the Romans who just jabbed the sword in as quickly as possible.
[02:39:10.761 --> 02:39:11.441]  Alright, you gave up.
[02:39:11.441 --> 02:39:12.601]  Come on out here.
[02:39:12.601 --> 02:39:13.222]  You never fought.
[02:39:13.222 --> 02:39:14.302]  We just showed up in your territory.
[02:39:14.302 --> 02:39:14.982]  We're taking over.
[02:39:14.982 --> 02:39:16.202]  We're going to kill your men.
[02:39:16.202 --> 02:39:17.583]  We don't trust turn our backs.
[02:39:17.583 --> 02:39:18.583]  While we're raping your wives.
[02:39:18.583 --> 02:39:19.603]  We know you're going to get mad.
[02:39:19.603 --> 02:39:20.404]  We're just going to kill you.
[02:39:20.404 --> 02:39:21.964]  We're going to let your kids live for now.
[02:39:21.964 --> 02:39:23.345]  Some will die in the gladiatorial ring.
[02:39:23.345 --> 02:39:24.845]  But we're going to make this quick.
[02:39:24.845 --> 02:39:25.525]  Sit down right there.
[02:39:25.525 --> 02:39:26.546]  Okay, hands are bound.
[02:39:26.546 --> 02:39:27.266]  Alright, make it quick.
[02:39:28.666 --> 02:39:29.467]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:39:29.467 --> 02:39:35.791]  See, because the Romans, until they got really decadent and fell apart during the Republic phase, didn't really enjoy the killing at a certain level.
[02:39:35.791 --> 02:39:47.399]  But these groups, the beauty of a child looking like a concentration camp victim at six years old, toddling around, dying of cancer, is so beautiful to the New World Order vampires.
[02:39:47.399 --> 02:39:49.440]  It is such an expression of art for them.
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:50.261]  And I've actually studied it.
[02:39:50.261 --> 02:39:54.164]  The globalists, the top-selling art is dead children and maggot-covered corpses.
[02:39:55.445 --> 02:39:58.086]  And again, you wonder why they'll pay 30, 50 million for this stuff.
[02:39:58.086 --> 02:39:59.367]  Look at the New York Times.
[02:39:59.367 --> 02:40:00.688]  It's a gift.
[02:40:00.688 --> 02:40:04.611]  It's part of their tithing to ugliness.
[02:40:04.611 --> 02:40:15.959]  The obscenity of children starving by the tens of millions every year, while the elite are paying, you know, $59 million for a skull.
[02:40:15.959 --> 02:40:22.263]  Or $3 million for a glass jar with semen and blood in it.
[02:40:22.263 --> 02:40:23.044]  With a crucifix.
[02:40:24.963 --> 02:40:26.903]  It's an obscene.
[02:40:26.903 --> 02:40:32.684]  Look, again, they stole it from old widows and stole their pension funds and their husband's pension funds.
[02:40:32.684 --> 02:40:33.765]  They wreck societies.
[02:40:33.765 --> 02:40:37.685]  They bomb third world countries for this money, just sucking it out.
[02:40:37.685 --> 02:40:43.907]  And then they give it to some sicko guru artist who, you know, always have some devil name prancing around.
[02:40:43.907 --> 02:40:50.128]  And they're into the weakness, the pot belliedness, the chicken neck of the little devil worshipper, the elites going in and buying it.
[02:40:50.128 --> 02:40:51.508]  It's all part of the sickness.
[02:40:51.508 --> 02:40:51.728]  It's all
[02:40:52.028 --> 02:40:55.031]  Part of the worshiping of the ugliness.
[02:40:55.031 --> 02:40:56.833]  It's all part of the love of it.
[02:40:56.833 --> 02:41:02.719]  You now see the spirit of what we face and why, of course, it must be resisted.
[02:41:02.719 --> 02:41:06.743]  And there's soldiers in their black uniforms marching out.
[02:41:06.743 --> 02:41:08.766]  And the pot-bellied goblin TSA.
[02:41:11.792 --> 02:41:13.613]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[02:41:13.613 --> 02:41:14.754]  Sorry, I haven't.
[02:41:14.754 --> 02:41:15.374]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:41:15.374 --> 02:41:18.256]  You will face the full horror, or they will win!
[02:41:18.256 --> 02:41:19.717]  You must break your trance.
[02:41:19.717 --> 02:41:20.557]  You must break out.
[02:41:20.557 --> 02:41:21.558]  You must stand up.
[02:41:21.558 --> 02:41:22.938]  You already know I'm telling you the truth.
[02:41:22.938 --> 02:41:24.699]  You can go look at all this information I've shown you.
[02:41:24.699 --> 02:41:25.620]  You must awaken.
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:27.581]  You must physically jump up out of your seat.
[02:41:27.581 --> 02:41:30.023]  That's the sign of someone who's awakened!
[02:41:30.023 --> 02:41:31.283]  Awakened for war!
[02:41:31.283 --> 02:41:35.185]  We didn't look for war!
[02:41:35.185 --> 02:41:36.446]  But war they will get!
[02:41:36.446 --> 02:41:37.467]  War they must have!
[02:41:38.885 --> 02:41:40.685]  They will not give us quarter.
[02:41:40.685 --> 02:41:45.506]  Evil wages war against good, period.
[02:41:45.506 --> 02:41:50.647]  And the evil's greatest trick is convincing you it doesn't exist.
[02:41:50.647 --> 02:41:56.968]  Steal your dreams, blind your eyes.
[02:41:56.968 --> 02:42:02.809]  Your spiritual eyes.
[02:42:02.809 --> 02:42:05.510]  JB, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:42:06.941 --> 02:42:14.203]  Oh, Alex, it is an honor and a pleasure to talk to another paladin in this war we got going on.
[02:42:14.203 --> 02:42:27.106]  It's pretty good that you brought up the spirituality part of this, because I read a lot of prophecy, a lot of scripture, read a lot of revelations.
[02:42:27.106 --> 02:42:33.347]  And sadly, it's getting to the point where you can almost just turn on the news and kind of follow along, you know, in the good book.
[02:42:34.984 --> 02:42:45.214]  Uh, I just wonder, and this is kind of your take on this, what do you think about what has been, the message that's been given to us there in Revelations?
[02:42:45.214 --> 02:42:53.522]  It says that there will be an ultimate evil and it will take over the world and it will, you know, the dragon will be given the power to kill the saints.
[02:42:53.522 --> 02:42:54.183]  For one hour.
[02:42:58.133 --> 02:42:59.316]  For an hour.
[02:42:59.316 --> 02:43:00.418]  Well, what do you think?
[02:43:00.418 --> 02:43:05.348]  Is this a fight that we're just fighting to like hold off this culmination of history?
[02:43:05.933 --> 02:43:10.995]  Well, look, God has to let it go all the way to prove we're willing to go up against this.
[02:43:10.995 --> 02:43:11.795]  This is an honor.
[02:43:11.795 --> 02:43:13.236]  This is something good.
[02:43:13.236 --> 02:43:23.320]  And all these blind people who can't see the evil now, when it rises up and is so horrible, and billions are dying, they will then, that's the awakening.
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:27.021]  And that's why the rapture is such a big lie, because it comes after, clearly.
[02:43:27.021 --> 02:43:33.504]  I mean, a five-year-old could read that the devil's defeated, he's bound up by the archangel, and
[02:43:34.284 --> 02:43:36.407]  Then, all this stuff happens.
[02:43:36.407 --> 02:43:40.152]  Obviously, the beast wages war against the saints and overcomes them.
[02:43:40.152 --> 02:43:42.555]  How was there saints if they all teleported out?
[02:43:42.555 --> 02:43:44.819]  All these church ladies running around on the TVs.
[02:43:44.819 --> 02:43:45.760]  Oh, praise God!
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:50.086]  I go worship some glitterbug effeminate preacher that's obviously a demon.
[02:43:50.086 --> 02:43:50.947]  Anybody can look at him.
[02:43:51.447 --> 02:43:56.052]  Just a demon out in the open so that those that have eyes turn away from God because they see it's a demon.
[02:43:56.052 --> 02:44:02.539]  It's just for blind, blind little gibbering goblin creatures who are running from the fear.
[02:44:02.539 --> 02:44:11.328]  It's a lower demigod, is what these preachers are, that they go before and that God promises them a way out of suffering.
[02:44:12.122 --> 02:44:12.744]  Okay?
[02:44:12.744 --> 02:44:20.785]  They go to these low-level demons that sit up there and defile God and make God look weak to turn people with discernment away from God.
[02:44:21.547 --> 02:44:23.668]  We have a mid-level discernment.
[02:44:23.668 --> 02:44:26.088]  So that's what the Glitter Bugs on TV are all about.
[02:44:26.088 --> 02:44:31.390]  To sell their false doctrines, to sell their evil, to get everybody fighting over all the false doctrines.
[02:44:31.390 --> 02:44:35.111]  When if you tune into God, it's right there.
[02:44:35.111 --> 02:44:36.171]  You feel it, you know it.
[02:44:36.171 --> 02:44:39.572]  You're not going to have to be directed by some Glitter Bug creature.
[02:44:39.572 --> 02:44:43.993]  You're going to be perfect either, but you're going to know right from wrong.
[02:44:43.993 --> 02:44:44.673]  Okay?
[02:44:44.673 --> 02:44:45.894]  And each according to their gifts.
[02:44:45.894 --> 02:44:46.674]  All of us are different.
[02:44:49.128 --> 02:44:56.514]  Once you're looking at this system, and once people realize what they're facing, there's not a choice.
[02:44:56.514 --> 02:44:58.376]  We're going through it anyways.
[02:44:58.376 --> 02:45:02.059]  And in no doubt, the world government's going to rise.
[02:45:02.059 --> 02:45:07.063]  And what?
[02:45:07.063 --> 02:45:09.645]  They kill a third of the earth in just a very short period?
[02:45:09.645 --> 02:45:10.886]  Is it a third or is it more?
[02:45:10.886 --> 02:45:11.247]  I forget.
[02:45:13.323 --> 02:45:16.585]  I mean, that's what the UN says they're going to do.
[02:45:16.585 --> 02:45:21.088]  They say they're going to kill 90% or more.
[02:45:21.088 --> 02:45:23.069]  They debate 80 to 90%.
[02:45:23.069 --> 02:45:25.551]  And of course, that's just so the small number doesn't think they're going to get it.
[02:45:25.551 --> 02:45:27.772]  Really, I've gotten a deeper research.
[02:45:27.772 --> 02:45:29.874]  They plan on getting rid of almost everybody.
[02:45:29.874 --> 02:45:30.494]  Down to less than 1%.
[02:45:30.494 --> 02:45:39.079]  And it says if God didn't shorten the days, there would be no flesh left.
[02:45:39.079 --> 02:45:41.101]  You can pull up that passage, and that's what's going to happen.
[02:45:42.154 --> 02:45:46.456]  And listen, it's not even religious now.
[02:45:46.456 --> 02:45:48.076]  This is the real deal.
[02:45:48.076 --> 02:45:50.397]  The elite believe they're the Merovingians.
[02:45:50.397 --> 02:45:55.779]  They believe Jesus had these children with Mary Magdalene.
[02:45:55.779 --> 02:46:03.442]  These royal bloodlines believe from Count Dracula right through to Prince Charles that they are the Christ.
[02:46:04.918 --> 02:46:16.286]  And they believe their Christ, Lucifer, has to kill the majority of the public because they're profane so that only the initiated ones can go into the new system.
[02:46:16.286 --> 02:46:20.148]  And they're all going to be deceived and they're all going to be destroyed.
[02:46:20.148 --> 02:46:22.089]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:46:22.089 --> 02:46:27.133]  And I don't get into religious stuff here very often because I just stick to the facts.
[02:46:27.133 --> 02:46:31.315]  But there's no doubt, let's just say there isn't a god or a devil.
[02:46:31.315 --> 02:46:33.097]  These people might as well just be it.
[02:46:34.068 --> 02:46:34.769]  Okay.
[02:46:34.769 --> 02:46:37.153]  I mean, they sure act like it.
[02:46:37.153 --> 02:46:42.240]  I mean, the stuff the New World Order does, man, I mean, you've got to be blacker than hell.
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:44.984]  You've got to be in the center of a black hole evil.
[02:46:44.984 --> 02:46:49.811]  I mean, just Hellraiser, you know, off the charts, you know.
[02:46:51.044 --> 02:46:59.226]  I mean, these people are literally, might as well be interdimensional creatures that love watching children be torn limb from limb.
[02:46:59.226 --> 02:47:00.606]  I mean, that's what they are.
[02:47:00.606 --> 02:47:01.406]  They like death.
[02:47:01.406 --> 02:47:03.627]  They like barren planets.
[02:47:03.627 --> 02:47:05.207]  That's what we're dealing with.
[02:47:05.207 --> 02:47:08.888]  We're dealing with cancer.
[02:47:08.888 --> 02:47:16.870]  And it's either faced, because all that matters is your soul.
[02:47:16.870 --> 02:47:17.630]  You either face it,
[02:47:19.198 --> 02:47:21.520]  And deal with it or you give yourself over to it.
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:26.063]  And most people will give themselves to it because of the great delusion.
[02:47:26.063 --> 02:47:29.425]  But as things get horrible, a lot of them are going to wake up.
[02:47:29.425 --> 02:47:30.385]  And that's the important point.
[02:47:30.385 --> 02:47:32.066]  You understand me, JB?
[02:47:32.066 --> 02:47:33.647]  Oh, absolutely, Alex.
[02:47:33.647 --> 02:47:37.070]  You gave the exact answer I wanted to hear.
[02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:40.872]  And I know you didn't even mean to do that.
[02:47:40.872 --> 02:47:41.893]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:47:42.642 --> 02:47:52.108]  Well, if you meet somebody on the road and they know the truth and you know the truth, you know, you'll you'll you'll wonder how they are thinking the same thought because universal truth is written on all our hearts.
[02:47:52.108 --> 02:47:53.769]  It's whether we choose to see it or not.
[02:47:53.769 --> 02:47:54.709]  I got a jump JB.
[02:47:54.709 --> 02:48:02.934]  I appreciate your call, but it is let's go to let's go to John in Wisconsin.
[02:48:02.934 --> 02:48:03.475]  You're up next.
[02:48:03.475 --> 02:48:04.015]  Thanks for holding.
[02:48:05.563 --> 02:48:13.289]  Hi Alex, great show yesterday, and I think it falls in line very nicely with your recent broadcast with your guest Alfred Adask.
[02:48:13.289 --> 02:48:17.612]  A lot of the same themes, and I believe that was September 13th or 14th of this past year.
[02:48:17.612 --> 02:48:20.034]  No, it's not even themes, it's truth!
[02:48:20.034 --> 02:48:28.500]  No, absolutely, and when you talk about seeing that look in people's eyes and their level of being affected, as I call it.
[02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:34.405]  I was just at a production regarding the Wellstone assassination in Wisconsin, and
[02:48:35.541 --> 02:48:41.346]  I play a little game with our friends called Spot the Spook and it's pretty easy to do, actually.
[02:48:41.346 --> 02:49:00.363]  And I'm telling you, what you're talking about gives me goosebumps because it happens to me on almost a daily basis and I can't explain that to my 41 employees and just trying to convince them... Well, when you start tuning into the truth in your own self, then you're able to recognize more.
[02:49:00.363 --> 02:49:01.003]  What's the saying?
[02:49:01.857 --> 02:49:04.480]  You know, the teacher appears when the student is ready.
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:06.382]  And all of us are students.
[02:49:06.382 --> 02:49:08.103]  And so, it's always there.
[02:49:08.103 --> 02:49:10.806]  People who are into lies will buy more and more lies.
[02:49:10.806 --> 02:49:15.290]  People that are into truth... You know, it's like at any big police department.
[02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:16.772]  They know the one detective to go to.
[02:49:16.772 --> 02:49:19.495]  They don't know why he knows how to always find something.
[02:49:19.495 --> 02:49:23.699]  It's because that person is tuned in and has that gift.
[02:49:23.699 --> 02:49:25.040]  And so, you've got that gift.
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:25.641]  That's what it is.
[02:49:27.045 --> 02:49:41.464]  And going back to the original topic for callers today, speaking of the future, there are many, many things conceptually, and I've actually just purchased 84 Prison Planet memberships about a week and a half ago, and I'm spreading out my little business cards to
[02:49:42.259 --> 02:49:53.225]  All of the truth-seekers in Wisconsin, and there are lots of them, I have full-spectrum awareness, but I don't have what you have, which is total informational awareness, or as close to that.
[02:49:53.225 --> 02:49:54.606]  It's not total.
[02:49:54.606 --> 02:49:58.628]  No, it's a fraction, but it still might as well be total.
[02:49:58.628 --> 02:50:03.031]  Because that fractal goes into the same makeup of the universe.
[02:50:03.031 --> 02:50:05.092]  Things repeat themselves over and over again.
[02:50:05.092 --> 02:50:08.534]  So, it's like the alchemists say, so above, so below.
[02:50:08.534 --> 02:50:10.315]  Once you know this part, you know that part.
[02:50:11.769 --> 02:50:14.417]  So people need to pay attention to the spirituality.
[02:50:14.417 --> 02:50:18.370]  I mean, I was raised Unitarian, I was raised in a progressive anti-gun household.
[02:50:19.245 --> 02:50:23.369]  I was vegetarian for three years with a long ponytail and living in Madison, Wisconsin.
[02:50:23.369 --> 02:50:24.550]  Things have changed.
[02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:37.621]  Let's just say I'm a progressive libertarian with my own business and I have my own little soapbox but I'm working on a video which might be outlawed if I don't get it done in time by the TSA legislation.
[02:50:37.621 --> 02:50:40.044]  I'm glad you just said that because I'm going to skip this final break.
[02:50:40.044 --> 02:50:43.547]  Network break station shouldn't cover this up so I can finish up with all these callers.
[02:50:43.547 --> 02:50:44.748]  I want to say this to you right now.
[02:50:46.257 --> 02:50:49.979]  People better use the internet like it's not going to be here next week.
[02:50:49.979 --> 02:50:52.440]  Stop just thinking it's always going to be there.
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:57.742]  We've now confirmed the Feds are telling them take down videos that are quote critical of the government.
[02:50:57.742 --> 02:51:00.903]  We already have the Federal Reserve trying to take down my channel.
[02:51:00.903 --> 02:51:06.505]  That's reached 150 million itself, all together 300 million in the last two years, just on YouTube.
[02:51:06.505 --> 02:51:08.406]  They're already coming after us, okay?
[02:51:08.406 --> 02:51:10.427]  I don't get into all the behind the scenes stuff.
[02:51:10.427 --> 02:51:12.028]  Folks, you better use it.
[02:51:12.881 --> 02:51:14.162]  You better download it.
[02:51:14.162 --> 02:51:15.762]  You better save stuff now.
[02:51:15.762 --> 02:51:18.023]  You better start valuing information.
[02:51:18.023 --> 02:51:19.104]  By the way, that's a great idea.
[02:51:19.104 --> 02:51:21.165]  We honor people that want to get out memberships.
[02:51:21.165 --> 02:51:34.891]  Print up a monthly membership where it's a pre-made code and username and then sell them discounted in bulk where people get a one-month membership that activates as soon as that code goes in for prisonplanet.tv and that's totally anonymous.
[02:51:34.891 --> 02:51:36.732]  Well, that is a good idea.
[02:51:36.732 --> 02:51:38.233]  I appreciate your call.
[02:51:38.233 --> 02:51:39.553]  Wow, I need to write that down.
[02:51:42.858 --> 02:51:44.780]  You know, let's say you don't believe in God, okay?
[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:53.452]  Whatever it is, let's say that, and they've proven this in studies, that whatever, they have an island of research monkeys.
[02:51:53.452 --> 02:52:01.242]  And as soon as this island of monkeys figures out to do some new complex task they were trained, suddenly, an island five miles away, the monkeys suddenly know how to do it.
[02:52:03.089 --> 02:52:05.789]  So it's almost like, and they've proven this, it's like a broadcast.
[02:52:05.789 --> 02:52:09.350]  Our brains are broadcasting something, the sixth sense, whatever.
[02:52:09.350 --> 02:52:11.310]  And so evil has its resonance.
[02:52:11.310 --> 02:52:13.571]  We want to be scientific about it.
[02:52:13.571 --> 02:52:17.232]  Something for atheists to try to understand, because we at least know this level is there.
[02:52:17.232 --> 02:52:19.032]  And of course there's more.
[02:52:19.032 --> 02:52:26.093]  But what's been proven is, in all groups of mammals especially, but also insects, birds, how do they know two days before an earthquake's coming?
[02:52:26.093 --> 02:52:27.653]  Or a hurricane?
[02:52:27.653 --> 02:52:29.194]  How do birds fly 4,000 miles, 6,000 miles?
[02:52:32.441 --> 02:52:33.862]  Magnetic lines.
[02:52:33.862 --> 02:52:35.322]  There's parts of the brain.
[02:52:35.322 --> 02:52:38.344]  A lot of the elites build power cities on magnetic lines.
[02:52:38.344 --> 02:52:39.704]  The elites know all this stuff.
[02:52:39.704 --> 02:52:41.745]  They know a lot more than we know.
[02:52:41.745 --> 02:52:44.186]  I only have a limited lifetime to learn this information.
[02:52:44.186 --> 02:52:46.447]  They secretly have guilds that keep the information.
[02:52:48.709 --> 02:52:50.149]  And they're directed.
[02:52:50.149 --> 02:52:55.831]  And you could call it the group consciousness of these evil people as they get together, and that's what they believe they're doing, to manifest.
[02:52:55.831 --> 02:52:57.791]  I mean, it's just, it's unspeakably bad.
[02:52:57.791 --> 02:53:04.253]  We, the good people, have to just cry out to the Creator and say, empower us, we repent.
[02:53:04.253 --> 02:53:06.453]  And repent means we want to change.
[02:53:06.453 --> 02:53:08.834]  We want to be directed by the good force.
[02:53:09.915 --> 02:53:12.737]  And you have to say, I'm turning myself over.
[02:53:12.737 --> 02:53:15.819]  And you're not turning yourself over to slavery like with the devil.
[02:53:15.819 --> 02:53:24.645]  You're turning yourself over to persecution, but that is not even an issue once God starts turning keys and opening doors.
[02:53:24.645 --> 02:53:27.427]  I don't know how to describe it to people, but it's unbelievable.
[02:53:28.228 --> 02:53:35.939]  I mean, all these worldly people looking for power, looking for sustenance, looking for fulfillment, and the more evil they get, the less fulfilled they are.
[02:53:35.939 --> 02:53:44.470]  You, let me tell you something, if you really serve the creator of the universe, ladies and gentlemen, you are so fulfilled, it's almost like, God, I can't handle this.
[02:53:45.353 --> 02:53:50.156]  I cannot handle this level of understanding with my primitive little brain.
[02:53:50.156 --> 02:53:59.643]  Because I'm still the flesh, I'm still weak, I've still got all this evil stuff going on, but then I've got all this other information sitting on top of it, and it's like constant.
[02:53:59.643 --> 02:54:01.524]  And it is a great weight.
[02:54:01.524 --> 02:54:05.087]  It's empowering, but it's also a giant weight on you.
[02:54:06.374 --> 02:54:07.795]  It is heavy.
[02:54:07.795 --> 02:54:11.899]  So, look, a lot of you people out there looking for power.
[02:54:11.899 --> 02:54:14.561]  By the way, if you've got evil power, it's got a great weight as well.
[02:54:14.561 --> 02:54:18.365]  People looking for power, do you actually know what comes with power?
[02:54:18.365 --> 02:54:21.608]  Do you have any idea what comes with power?
[02:54:22.793 --> 02:54:24.754]  I don't think you understand what comes with power.
[02:54:24.754 --> 02:54:30.276]  And I have never wanted to step more into those positions and the responsibility and what it takes.
[02:54:30.276 --> 02:54:39.440]  But it must be done because I am more sure than I've ever been 100% of the righteousness of the path that we're on and that we are going in the right direction.
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:40.381]  Does that mean we're perfect?
[02:54:40.381 --> 02:54:40.521]  No.
[02:54:41.604 --> 02:54:48.888]  The enemy always attacks us by pointing out how we're not perfect and manipulates the humble.
[02:54:48.888 --> 02:54:58.794]  It's time for the humble to stand up and stop second-guessing ourselves and take up the weapons of truth and liberty and charge the enemy head-on.
[02:54:58.794 --> 02:55:02.096]  And in those fights, we will find fulfillment.
[02:55:02.096 --> 02:55:05.858]  It is only... What's the military saying about physical training?
[02:55:05.858 --> 02:55:08.460]  Pain is weakness leaving the body.
[02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:10.401]  What about psychic, spiritual pain?
[02:55:11.343 --> 02:55:13.424]  What about not caring about peer pressure?
[02:55:13.424 --> 02:55:16.024]  To the point of you actually enjoy being persecuted.
[02:55:16.024 --> 02:55:31.589]  Not in a sick, sadomasochistic way, but in a way of knowing that their persecution is the fact that you have put them in a position to have to check what they're doing, and that out of what you have done by applying force to them, that some of these people are going to be saved.
[02:55:33.123 --> 02:55:41.310]  It's like when you've got, I had a big old blister on the bottom of my foot from walking all over the place on my trip in a big pair of boots I didn't know would mess my feet up.
[02:55:41.310 --> 02:55:49.898]  And I had this big, almost stone bruised, big pool, you know, underneath big pit calluses.
[02:55:49.898 --> 02:55:54.222]  And I finally last night just got a knife, even though it was bloody, and just sliced that off.
[02:55:54.222 --> 02:55:58.526]  And let me tell you, it hurt at the time, but it felt so much better this morning to be walking around with that going.
[02:55:59.701 --> 02:56:01.322]  People are like, what are you doing doing your own surgery?
[02:56:01.322 --> 02:56:05.386]  I've got an old army manual on how to field dress, you know, stuff with your feet.
[02:56:05.386 --> 02:56:06.447]  It was no big deal.
[02:56:06.447 --> 02:56:07.528]  It was barely pink meat.
[02:56:07.528 --> 02:56:10.831]  It was, you know, the lowest level of skin when I sliced it off, but it's gone.
[02:56:10.831 --> 02:56:13.313]  Those people are like, oh, you sliced off your own giant blister.
[02:56:13.313 --> 02:56:14.534]  It's no big deal.
[02:56:14.534 --> 02:56:17.296]  The point is, is it was painful when I did it.
[02:56:17.296 --> 02:56:21.240]  And there was even a blister below that level and I jabbed the knife in there to get that out of there.
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.423]  But it hurt right then instead of days of pain and it's festering.
[02:56:26.311 --> 02:56:26.651]  You see?
[02:56:26.651 --> 02:56:29.393]  And so that's why I like persecution.
[02:56:29.393 --> 02:56:34.155]  That's the sign of the weakness leaving their body.
[02:56:34.155 --> 02:56:39.098]  I don't like the persecution myself, but I know it's a sign of good things happening.
[02:56:39.098 --> 02:56:40.358]  Alright, I've gone overboard again.
[02:56:40.358 --> 02:56:42.179]  I haven't gotten to these calls.
[02:56:42.179 --> 02:56:46.041]  I want to get to Father Jack Lee, Five Minutes Overdrive, Alaric.
[02:56:46.041 --> 02:56:46.862]  Gotta like that name.
[02:56:46.862 --> 02:56:48.543]  That's the sacker of Rome 410.
[02:56:48.543 --> 02:56:50.284]  And then we've got, uh...
[02:56:51.155 --> 02:56:52.555]  I gotta go to Pastor in Ohio.
[02:56:52.555 --> 02:56:57.097]  He just gave us the secret FEMA plans, which were later made public.
[02:56:57.097 --> 02:57:00.558]  Pastor, real quick, what's on your mind?
[02:57:00.558 --> 02:57:03.539]  What these other people have been talking about is true.
[02:57:03.539 --> 02:57:06.220]  You know, it is a spiritual war, and you said the same thing.
[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:10.821]  But you know, one of the things that stands out to me is this.
[02:57:10.821 --> 02:57:16.203]  You know, as you know, I've been a minister for almost 30 years, and I've never taken a paycheck.
[02:57:16.203 --> 02:57:20.164]  Because when God called me into this, it was not an occupation.
[02:57:20.164 --> 02:57:20.884]  It was a calling.
[02:57:21.323 --> 02:57:25.209]  And here's the thing, the pastors are not telling the people the truth.
[02:57:25.209 --> 02:57:33.762]  They're not standing in the pulpits like they did before 1776, letting people know that they do have a right to fight back
[02:57:34.697 --> 02:57:37.678]  That was the whole purpose of the Constitution.
[02:57:37.678 --> 02:57:52.524]  It was prayed over, and God gave these men, over 235 years ago, the wisdom and everything to put all of this together so that it would last for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[02:57:54.364 --> 02:58:00.488]  And that way, as a republic, then the people have the ability to keep it.
[02:58:00.488 --> 02:58:05.712]  Under democracy, or socialism, or fascism, you don't have that option.
[02:58:05.712 --> 02:58:07.473]  Where under a republic, you do.
[02:58:08.203 --> 02:58:09.524]  And that's one of the things.
[02:58:09.524 --> 02:58:16.750]  The wimpy pastors standing in the pulpit are not telling their people the truth that they need to be fighting for their freedoms.
[02:58:16.750 --> 02:58:18.452]  It's all about money.
[02:58:18.452 --> 02:58:21.854]  It's always been about money.
[02:58:21.854 --> 02:58:24.016]  And, you know, it's just like everything else.
[02:58:24.016 --> 02:58:25.958]  All the evil is going on in the world.
[02:58:25.958 --> 02:58:26.899]  Everything's going on.
[02:58:26.899 --> 02:58:31.742]  You can see it by the trillions and trillions of dollars that's going to the big bankers.
[02:58:31.742 --> 02:58:33.564]  It's all about the money.
[02:58:33.564 --> 02:58:36.727]  Well, yeah, the root of humans selling out is money.
[02:58:37.227 --> 02:58:42.914]  But the spirit of evil wants the soul.
[02:58:42.914 --> 02:58:46.339]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.662 --> 02:58:54.364]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:54.364 --> 02:58:59.671]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:58:59.671 --> 02:59:01.214]  Saving means to make money.
[02:59:01.214 --> 02:59:10.005]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:59:10.726 --> 02:59:18.249]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:59:18.249 --> 02:59:26.253]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:59:26.253 --> 02:59:31.495]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:59:36.997 --> 02:59:37.437]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:37.437 --> 02:59:40.218]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:09.321 --> 03:00:11.642]  All right, let's continue with some callers that have been holding.
[03:00:11.642 --> 03:00:15.565]  Father Jack in Kentucky, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:15.565 --> 03:00:18.667]  Oh, Mr. Jack, thank you for taking my call.
[03:00:18.667 --> 03:00:24.710]  You asked earlier today where we saw things going in the next two years.
[03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:25.811]  Yes.
[03:00:25.811 --> 03:00:35.877]  And you also mentioned yesterday in your broadcast the Vatican requesting or calling for the World Bank, which implies, of course,
[03:00:37.762 --> 03:00:41.365]  No, it's that one world global governance power.
[03:00:41.365 --> 03:00:42.565]  Correct.
[03:00:42.565 --> 03:01:03.440]  And one of the things I see occurring within the next two years, and I talk about this a lot on my blog, and it certainly gets me a lot of tears from both fellow Catholics and others, I see the Vatican playing a stronger role in this, especially in Europe, and I see the churches in America
[03:01:05.240 --> 03:01:09.162]  Helping to further the cause of globalism.
[03:01:09.162 --> 03:01:21.749]  And what I think a lot of people don't realize is that the roots of this situation in the Catholic Church specifically go back to the infiltration of the Church during the former Soviet Union.
[03:01:23.471 --> 03:01:43.788]  People into the seminaries and to our seminaries to rise to levels of power and influence and that is where they are today Well, well, I mean that's what I've said because I don't get into all this I mean, it's the Protestants the Catholics all these groups have the seminaries admittedly the World Council of Churches Have been infiltrated and so debating when it started or whatever.
[03:01:43.788 --> 03:01:44.448]  There's no doubt.
[03:01:44.448 --> 03:01:51.774]  Look at the fruits I mean look at what is being promoted in all these churches across the board And and there's almost no one
[03:01:53.445 --> 03:02:02.391]  And you know, it's like you said, there are a lot of people who are not addressing the issue of churches in the implementation of globalism.
[03:02:21.949 --> 03:02:25.234]  Churches are one of the primary fronts.
[03:02:25.234 --> 03:02:35.289]  They should be one of the areas most people are the most concerned with, because that is where people have a tendency to check their critical thinking skills.
[03:02:35.289 --> 03:02:35.890]  Unfortunately.
[03:02:37.222 --> 03:02:48.248]  Well, look, I mean, my parents go to a mainline Methodist church and they loved it and I'd been there some and it was good, good stuff.
[03:02:48.248 --> 03:02:49.409]  From my view, good pastor.
[03:02:49.409 --> 03:02:56.953]  Well, he just retired and they brought in some folks and it's clearly globalist and they're testing it.
[03:02:56.953 --> 03:02:58.974]  And they'll ask him, oh, do you guys like this?
[03:02:58.974 --> 03:03:00.375]  And people are kind of, huh?
[03:03:00.375 --> 03:03:02.416]  But I mean, that's what's going on.
[03:03:02.416 --> 03:03:04.137]  And people need to learn that
[03:03:05.479 --> 03:03:13.824]  The people sitting there preaching at you at the church, I mean, if it doesn't jive with reality, and it doesn't jive with common sense and the Bible, you need to get your butts out of there!
[03:03:13.824 --> 03:03:34.175]  But there's this, there's this God-shaped vacuum in all of our hearts, and so when they put some globalist up there in a, uh, priestly robes or whatever, people tend to think, well, this is, this is, this is, but you know, Christ, actually read the Bible, it's all about the Pharisees being a bunch of hypocrites and involving corruption, and he's there rebuking him, so they kill him!
[03:03:35.293 --> 03:03:38.455]  And you know, Pilate says, I find no fault in this man.
[03:03:38.455 --> 03:03:40.676]  And he says, okay, fine.
[03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:42.797]  It's a holy day.
[03:03:42.797 --> 03:03:44.498]  You can choose somebody I'm going to release.
[03:03:44.498 --> 03:03:48.400]  This horrible rapist killer, Barabbas or Christ?
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:51.941]  And they said, Barabbas, because that was what was popular.
[03:03:51.941 --> 03:03:56.164]  You know, people were sick of this guy telling them how they were corrupt.
[03:03:56.164 --> 03:03:57.104]  And so there you go.
[03:03:57.104 --> 03:04:00.146]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:00.146 --> 03:04:01.626]  Alaric in Omaha, Nebraska.
[03:04:01.626 --> 03:04:02.307]  We only got about a minute.
[03:04:02.307 --> 03:04:02.547]  Go ahead.
[03:04:04.264 --> 03:04:07.565]  Yeah, I just had a couple of small items here.
[03:04:07.565 --> 03:04:18.109]  The other day you were trying to come up with the name of the movie where they were handicapping people based upon being smarter or prettier than everybody else.
[03:04:18.109 --> 03:04:18.309]  Yes.
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:23.503]  That is a movie called Harrison Bergeron.
[03:04:23.503 --> 03:04:26.045]  It's based on the short story by Kurt Vonnegut.
[03:04:26.045 --> 03:04:26.746]  Yes.
[03:04:26.746 --> 03:04:31.050]  They rewrote the Constitution that says that not all men are created equal.
[03:04:31.050 --> 03:04:38.336]  It's the government's job to make them that way.
[03:04:38.336 --> 03:04:39.077]  Yeah, well, thank you.
[03:04:39.077 --> 03:04:40.819]  I remember, I guess I've read that years ago.
[03:04:40.819 --> 03:04:41.920]  Yeah, Kurt Vonnegut.
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:43.421]  Oh, look, Kurt Vonnegut was a listener.
[03:04:43.421 --> 03:04:43.962]  Great guy.
[03:04:43.962 --> 03:04:45.163]  Anything else?
[03:04:49.622 --> 03:04:51.545]  I wanted your input on HR 25.
[03:04:51.545 --> 03:04:54.030]  Alright, I'll try to do that tomorrow on the radio.
[03:04:54.030 --> 03:04:55.071]  See you tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:04:55.071 --> 03:04:56.053]  Special show.
