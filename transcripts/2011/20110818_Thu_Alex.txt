[00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.875]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.477]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.999]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.204]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.268]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:40.285]  It is Thursday, the 18th day of August 2011.
[00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:46.046]  We have an absolutely, totally jam-packed, key broadcast today.
[00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:51.088]  Things are just getting crazier and crazier, as you know, by the day.
[00:00:51.088 --> 00:00:54.369]  And we are going to be live here for the next...
[00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:56.473]  Three hours.
[00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:09.471]  We have Max Keiser, inventor of the virtual trading systems used worldwide today and also former top stockbroker, joining us to look at what's been happening with the economy.
[00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:13.313]  That is going to be coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:19.796]  In the last 30 minutes of the transmission, Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program, is going to be joining us via video Skype.
[00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:21.617]  For radio listeners, you'll be able to hear him.
[00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:26.519]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you'll be able, obviously, to watch him as well.
[00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.460]  And he was the head of the Star Wars program when it was still secret.
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:39.492]  In the late 70s until 1980, and he can give you the intel scoop on the secret space program.
[00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:46.180]  I mean, he won't say anything that's not been leaked or declassified, but he can really give you a lot of key information.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.942]  I wanted to get him on, obviously, last Friday.
[00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:57.189]  When it came out that they have that super secret spy plane that can fly into space and out of space.
[00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.613]  And they tested it by launching it on a rocket at tens of thousands of miles an hour.
[00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:06.235]  And so we're going to be talking about that with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:10.798]  It can go, what, from London to Tokyo in one hour.
[00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:16.162]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg with the secret science systems that are out there.
[00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:16.983]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:21.847]  Now, that said, all Hades is broken loose.
[00:02:21.847 --> 00:02:30.354]  The Drudge Report, as of I guess midnight last night, linked to our report, Big Sis' Latest Terrorist, More White Americans.
[00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:38.241]  And I meant to call Paul Watson yesterday when he wrote this article to have him add the central point, because he just dryly reports the facts.
[00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.302]  If there was any doubt that all these other PSAs
[00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:47.790]  Where everyone in the videos is a white person who's a terrorist and it's quote minorities that are reporting them.
[00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.338]  If anybody was doubting this was meant to create racial division and brand whites as the new terrorist, you know, as the one group you've got to look at.
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:06.651]  This new PSA is just the cherry on top, the final word on it, and Homeland Security's announced they're going to roll out a bunch more of these videos.
[00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:13.098]  So they're clearly, as you've seen the Vice President and the President and others, rebranding the domestic Tea Party threat
[00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:23.045]  If they can't beat a political movement that is identifying the private Federal Reserve and going after the power structure, then they are simply going to demonize it.
[00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:25.507]  So, more on that information today.
[00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:27.989]  I'd like to get your take on that issue.
[00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:44.905]  Specifically, if you're a police officer, a military person, or someone that works in private intelligence, I know there's a million of you now, and if you are buying this, I know they've been teaching you quietly for years this behind the scenes, but what do you think of the public rollout?
[00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:51.272]  Do you agree that returning veterans are the number one threat to America, and that conservatives and libertarians are the threat?
[00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:53.032]  Do you agree with this?
[00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:56.634]  I would specifically like to hear from you on this subject.
[00:03:56.634 --> 00:04:01.175]  Military, police, contractors, and others.
[00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:02.956]  Specifically, the phones are open for you.
[00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:03.016]  800-259-9231.
[00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:03.076]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:15.917]  Now, when we come back from break, I'm going to get into all the other insane news.
[00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:20.281]  The stock market has plunged 450 points today.
[00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:24.646]  Biden is over there begging for China to buy more of our worthless debt.
[00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:27.506]  And when I say our debt, it's not really ours.
[00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:30.469]  90 plus percent of it is the offshore megabanks.
[00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.411]  It's admitted that we're going into a depression.
[00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:40.238]  There are more riots going on around the world, including Germany, where nice cars are being torched as part of class envy.
[00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:40.718]  Idiots!
[00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:43.140]  It's not the people driving nice cars that are the enemy.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.623]  They're the people that come into your restaurant, go to your health club, go in your store.
[00:04:47.404 --> 00:05:00.733]  It's the ultra-trillionaire elites, the secret wealth groups, the shadow wealth groups, the shadow banking system that need to be politically dealt with through the legal system, not burning people's cars, you morons.
[00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:07.398]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:12.541]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:14.423]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:37.434]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it
[00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.551]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.332]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:46.233]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:52.857]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:55.558]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:57.919]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:58.780]  Others don't.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.004]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:12.451]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:14.713]  Number one, study the past.
[00:06:14.713 --> 00:06:17.115]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:20.838]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:25.049]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:28.893]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:06:28.893 --> 00:06:33.938]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:06:33.938 --> 00:06:37.362]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:41.343]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:45.845]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:50.767]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:55.389]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.570]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:15.966]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:19.650]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:33.419]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:40.685]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:07:41.365 --> 00:07:51.752]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:55.675]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:58.777]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:10.043]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:11.644]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.644 --> 00:08:13.166]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:17.369]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:21.472]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.271]  It is Thursday, the 18th day of August 2011.
[00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:33.871]  Gold is above $1,800 an ounce.
[00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:35.652]  In fact, I was just being given the latest numbers.
[00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:38.234]  Did I hear you correctly, John?
[00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:38.254]  $1,822.
[00:08:38.254 --> 00:08:39.255]  Let's put that on screen.
[00:08:39.255 --> 00:08:39.976]  That is unbelievable. $1,800.
[00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:01.169]  And $22.
[00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:03.249]  $1,822 total.
[00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:16.194]  That, of course, is on news of Joe Biden, the guy that says the Tea Party is the number one threat to America, not the big mega banks that took over our country, set up the policy of globalism and de-industrialized our nation.
[00:09:16.194 --> 00:09:24.778]  No, it's not the globalists who've been running this country's finances since 1913 that are causing all the inflation and the de-industrialization.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.304]  It's all the fault of Ron Paul and the Tea Party.
[00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:36.489]  And you've heard the Vice President and others, and the police are being taught this, that it's the Tea Party.
[00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:38.091]  They're getting ready to blow stuff up.
[00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:39.372]  They're Al-Qaeda.
[00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:44.396]  This whole Al-Qaeda police state grid set up to protect us from Al-Qaeda, supposedly.
[00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:45.917]  It's going to have to be used against you.
[00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:54.303]  And if you go to the Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com, and go over to the right-hand side, you can find our article from yesterday.
[00:09:54.303 --> 00:10:08.552]  Big Sis, Homeland Security, if anybody thought that all the other videos they put out were all the terrorists are white, all the good guys are dark-skinned, reporting on the evil white people that the media has branded as the Tea Party.
[00:10:08.552 --> 00:10:10.233]  The Tea Party is open to everybody.
[00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:15.717]  It's a movement for liberty and freedom and getting government under control, but the establishment dinosaur media
[00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:24.779]  Uh, has, uh, come out and said, uh, that the Tea Party is white and white only and racist.
[00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:27.460]  And yes, they're getting ready to start bombing.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.920]  And so we're going to have to use the police and the army on them.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:45.384]  And you've got all the White House memos and White House advisors we read yesterday saying minus a new Oklahoma City or 9-11, they're not going to be able to get their agenda through of gun control, open borders, massive tax increases, globalization.
[00:10:46.064 --> 00:10:48.325]  The end of our sovereignty.
[00:10:48.325 --> 00:10:50.186]  The Green Police, all of it.
[00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:52.587]  So it is on big time.
[00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:59.391]  And I'm opening the phones up ahead of Max Keiser joining us on The Economy, coming up in about an hour and 20 minutes from now.
[00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:03.193]  Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars SDI program.
[00:11:04.127 --> 00:11:12.410]  He'll be joining us to break down why are they now rolling out a lot of the secret space planes that they've had for a long time.
[00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:21.493]  Why are they now telling the public about that and what can he tell us that is in the declassified realm but not popularly and commonly known.
[00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:25.395]  So that'll be in the last 30 minutes of the transmission today.
[00:11:26.744 --> 00:11:37.633]  But Mr. Biden, the Vice President, is over in China publicly begging them to prop up the dollar further and to buy the worthless Treasury bills.
[00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:41.076]  The Federal Reserve is buying 75-plus percent.
[00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.017]  I've had economists on who have corrected me.
[00:11:43.017 --> 00:11:45.699]  They say, Alex, that 75 percent was a year ago.
[00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:48.382]  The Federal Reserve is now monetizing over 80 percent.
[00:11:48.962 --> 00:11:50.403]  Well, whatever.
[00:11:50.403 --> 00:11:55.587]  The point is, is that we're going into a hyperinflationary spiral.
[00:11:55.587 --> 00:11:58.609]  Will we go all the way to Weimar Republic status?
[00:11:58.609 --> 00:12:00.230]  Are Zimbabwe in inflation?
[00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.131]  I certainly hope not.
[00:12:01.857 --> 00:12:10.483]  But it is definitely accelerating right now, and the system's been trying to deny that, but the facts are starting to come out.
[00:12:10.483 --> 00:12:14.546]  Global markets tumble amid jitters about debt and the economy.
[00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:22.691]  World stock markets tumbled and gold shot to a new record high Thursday on renewed worries about Europe's debt crisis and a weak U.S.
[00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:23.812]  economic data.
[00:12:25.496 --> 00:12:25.776]  U.S.
[00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:28.999]  home sales are plunging at record rates.
[00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:31.340]  The stock market was down 450 points.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.582]  It went back up about 50 points and now started its drop again.
[00:12:34.582 --> 00:12:39.326]  It's down 421.22 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:41.807]  NASDAQ's down 118.
[00:12:41.807 --> 00:12:42.788]  S&P down 48.
[00:12:42.788 --> 00:12:49.112]  So we'll continue to break all of that down as it unfolds.
[00:12:49.112 --> 00:12:51.194]  The global rush by governments
[00:12:51.974 --> 00:12:58.478]  Institutions like universities and major companies to grab gold is on.
[00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:02.681]  I only wish I would have listened to my wife five years ago.
[00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:11.727]  She said, honey, you're keeping a bunch of money in the company bank account as an emergency backup to run InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:13:11.727 --> 00:13:14.849]  And we have no reserves, basically, of our own.
[00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:17.410]  And she said, they could devalue that.
[00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.770]  You're the one saying, buy gold.
[00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:32.774]  And I said, well, I bought our personal gold and silver, but I'm keeping this in reserves to basically, as we go into this depression, keep this operation going, at least for a while, if things totally collapse.
[00:13:32.774 --> 00:13:33.954]  But she's right.
[00:13:33.954 --> 00:13:37.555]  I wish I would have bought gold when it was $800, $1,000 for the backup nest egg for this operation.
[00:13:42.076 --> 00:13:49.903]  Because now I'm spending the cash we have saved regardless to start the TV show and the other news programs we're going to build around it.
[00:13:49.903 --> 00:13:57.870]  But even though I sit here and give people advice all day about getting to gold, getting to silver, I understand it sounds like a lot at $1,000 an ounce or $1,822 and rising.
[00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.131]  But again, it's not that gold is really that
[00:14:07.077 --> 00:14:10.020]  We're not in 1995 numbers.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:16.204]  It's that gold is simply more now because the dollar is being devalued and the U.S.
[00:14:16.204 --> 00:14:21.208]  government, the private banks that have hijacked our government, have told the world they're going to devalue.
[00:14:21.989 --> 00:14:35.191]  That's why I played that clip two or three times last week, where Alan Greenspan on Meet the Prestitutes, to use a Gerald Salente term, was up there with the Obama White House economic advisor.
[00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:43.267]  And he shook his head whenever Greenspan, the former head of the Fed, said, we're not going to default.
[00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:44.928]  We're just going to print money.
[00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:49.470]  And the host and the guest, the other guest, went and actually did a double take.
[00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:54.733]  You could tell they had an adrenaline rush of shock that this was being said openly.
[00:14:54.733 --> 00:15:04.299]  So they're now going to hide in plain view the fact that they are absolutely robbing every man, woman and child in this country.
[00:15:05.563 --> 00:15:08.985]  It's one thing to know their policies are going to lead to rack and ruin.
[00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:13.867]  It's another thing to now be sliding in to it.
[00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:24.152]  And I liken it to the time my father and I were driving out of Fredericksburg, visiting family back into Austin and outside Stonewall, got hit by a tornado.
[00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:27.494]  Tornadoes in the summer, late summer, just formed out of nowhere.
[00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:29.695]  We didn't know it was a tornado until the state police got there.
[00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.096]  And we said, our truck just got thrown off the road.
[00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:33.217]  And they said, yeah, we know.
[00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:36.664]  Did you see the barn blown over right there?
[00:15:36.664 --> 00:15:39.927]  And the power's out in town and cars are dumped over?
[00:15:39.927 --> 00:15:41.209]  You were hit by a tornado.
[00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:42.750]  Look at the path of it right there.
[00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.232]  I was like, well, we didn't see it.
[00:15:45.232 --> 00:15:46.434]  Well, why didn't you pull over?
[00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:47.234]  Well, we didn't know.
[00:15:47.234 --> 00:15:49.036]  We didn't have news radio on.
[00:15:49.036 --> 00:15:50.778]  We didn't know a tornado formed.
[00:15:52.930 --> 00:16:00.234]  But as the car got blown off the road and spun down a 40-50 foot ditch, it was like five minutes.
[00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:02.575]  It was only a few seconds, but it felt like five minutes.
[00:16:02.575 --> 00:16:15.523]  I remember saying, brace for impact, and then we shot through the barbed wire fence at the bottom, and luckily as it spun, we hit the back of the Tahoe, or I guess Suburban, it was a stretched Tahoe, almost a Suburban.
[00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:26.185]  Into about three oak trees and it smashed about a third of the truck in broke our seats And my dad got a concussion and started throwing up.
[00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:32.207]  I was unfazed Thank God, but you're saying why are you telling the story again?
[00:16:32.207 --> 00:16:38.068]  That's what it feels like 2008 we feel the truck starts spinning and
[00:16:39.844 --> 00:16:42.505]  2009, we're starting to brace ourselves.
[00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:46.287]  2010, the truck starts going down the gully.
[00:16:46.287 --> 00:16:52.269]  Start of 2011, it goes through the barbed wire fence.
[00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:56.370]  And 2012, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to hit the oak trees.
[00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.211]  And it is not going to feel good.
[00:16:58.211 --> 00:17:06.874]  So, I'm just here to tell you, right now, that this isn't a game.
[00:17:07.987 --> 00:17:12.550]  And everybody better get their stuff in line.
[00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.472]  You better get our business together.
[00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:17.472]  And that means all of us.
[00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:20.394]  I was talking to my wife last night and I said, listen,
[00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:24.930]  We have got to get the hatches battened down.
[00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:31.412]  We got the water filters, we got the firearms, we've got the food, but I said I want to get more storable food.
[00:17:31.412 --> 00:17:37.814]  And I said we've got to talk to all of our families, even if some of them laugh at us, and we've got to tell them to get ready.
[00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:42.216]  Even if some of them don't listen, most of my family has listened.
[00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:44.416]  Most of my family is more awake than I am.
[00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:48.498]  Some of my family really helped wake me up to another level.
[00:17:48.498 --> 00:17:50.158]  And that's because they live in the real world.
[00:17:50.158 --> 00:18:05.422]  My mother's brother went out of high school and college, worked on oil rigs, and then I guess he volunteered to go to Vietnam and trained up in Dallas, Fort Worth there.
[00:18:05.422 --> 00:18:08.163]  Be a helicopter pilot, became a helicopter pilot in Vietnam.
[00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:10.034]  I think?
[00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:34.927]  I don't
[00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:50.391]  I don't think so.
[00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:16.369]  I saw what you'd call upper middle class type people and the men are all the same.
[00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:18.350]  They're all sports fanatics.
[00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:27.493]  They're all into how they look and having the coolest clothes and their wives are all the same and they're all, I'm sure, nice people.
[00:19:27.493 --> 00:19:37.817]  But I sat there in the restaurants watching them watch SportsCenter and heard all the men only talk about sports because that's what they've been given as a male role model is just being grown up little boys.
[00:19:39.037 --> 00:19:41.659]  No, men are supposed to be informed about the world.
[00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:45.182]  They're supposed to be politically and civically involved.
[00:19:45.182 --> 00:19:57.171]  Not because we're a bunch of busybodies, but because if you're not politically involved, you're going to be usurped by corrupt interests.
[00:19:57.171 --> 00:19:58.572]  And that's how it happens.
[00:19:58.572 --> 00:19:59.612]  And so we don't have a hope.
[00:20:00.573 --> 00:20:07.539]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.

[00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:40.144]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.144 --> 00:20:46.428]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.121]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:11.788]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:18.993]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:29.480]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.742]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:33.742 --> 00:22:39.884]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:39.884 --> 00:22:49.788]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:49.788 --> 00:22:51.289]  The war is here.
[00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:53.190]  It's an info war.
[00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.011]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:05.857]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[00:23:05.857 --> 00:23:06.857]  That's easy, Bill.
[00:23:06.857 --> 00:23:11.000]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.501]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:22.448]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[00:23:22.648 --> 00:23:23.268]  Really, Brian?
[00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:25.270]  The number one survival food?
[00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.411]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:28.432]  Absolutely, Bill.
[00:23:28.432 --> 00:23:39.859]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[00:23:39.859 --> 00:23:41.740]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:42.840]  No way, Bill.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.522]  You're not going to find these beans in any grocery store.
[00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:48.964]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[00:23:48.964 --> 00:23:51.645]  Visit soupbeanssurvival.com.
[00:23:51.645 --> 00:24:01.930]  That's soupbeanssurvival.com for all the information you're going to need for nature's super survival food.
[00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:07.714]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.714 --> 00:24:10.035]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:13.466]  Yeah, I got cut off by the break.
[00:24:13.466 --> 00:24:16.887]  Wasn't watching the clock and I didn't get to finish my statement.
[00:24:16.887 --> 00:24:18.968]  There is no hope.
[00:24:18.968 --> 00:24:19.829]  Go to break.
[00:24:19.829 --> 00:24:21.770]  I meant to finish the statement.
[00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.671]  There is no hope for this country and civilization.
[00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:51.030]  If men just think that they're going to go to work every day, and then go play golf, and then come home to their children at seven o'clock at night, and watch TV, and get up, and take their kids to school, and then turn them over to the government programming, and indoctrination, and then go to the sports bar, and then come home at eight o'clock, and maybe read their child a book, and then go to sleep.
[00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.273]  I mean, parents on average aren't even spending time with their children.
[00:24:55.592 --> 00:25:00.738]  I watch people's children in restaurants and almost all of them aren't even talking.
[00:25:00.738 --> 00:25:08.387]  Everyone is on their iPhones, their iPads, their Blackberries, their smartphones, including myself sometimes.
[00:25:08.387 --> 00:25:11.031]  So I will just leave my phone in the car.
[00:25:12.836 --> 00:25:16.078]  And if a national radio show calls me and I miss it, that's the way it is.
[00:25:16.078 --> 00:25:25.143]  I've got to sometimes stop working, even though my work is in direct challenge to the globalists and is solution-based.
[00:25:25.143 --> 00:25:27.504]  Imagine these other people.
[00:25:27.504 --> 00:25:31.327]  And sure, they're fighting for their, quote, great way of life and to make money.
[00:25:31.327 --> 00:25:38.431]  But at the end of the day, your money's not going to have any value and you're not going to have any economy to work in if we don't
[00:25:39.577 --> 00:25:47.400]  Get informed as a nation and as a planet to how things really work and stand up against this corrupt system.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.922]  Now, I'm going to open the phones up after I cover some of the economic and world news.
[00:25:52.922 --> 00:25:59.364]  I'm going to open them up now for police and military, current military, current police, former military.
[00:25:59.364 --> 00:26:03.086]  I know there's a million private contractors in this country.
[00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:15.700]  Do you really buy into the rebranding that's been going on behind the scenes for years but now is being publicly rolled out because they're getting ready to actually stage the events?
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:25.488]  Are you buying into the rebranding that the number one terror threat is returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, in the fetters, anti-globalist, anti-UN people?
[00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:34.224]  Basically anybody that's informed and involved and understands what's happened to this nation and this world and is trying to save the country.
[00:26:34.224 --> 00:26:36.805]  I mean, do you really buy that?
[00:26:36.805 --> 00:26:41.767]  And the good news is we've come so far as a society and as a nation.
[00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:44.349]  Here's the cover of the Austin American-Statesman yesterday.
[00:26:44.349 --> 00:26:47.490]  And it was the cover of many papers across the country.
[00:26:49.465 --> 00:26:52.086]  Perry talk of treason draws ire.
[00:26:52.086 --> 00:26:58.029]  Comments about Fed chief criticized, but governor stands by his statement.
[00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:08.073]  Even if Rick Perry is completely plastic and phony, the fact that he's coming out and saying treacherous, almost treasonous, the fact that he's having to identify the real government.
[00:27:08.991 --> 00:27:13.954]  The government that stays in place as presidents and congressmen and women come and go.
[00:27:13.954 --> 00:27:32.687]  The fact that we've gotten to that point, that Michelle Bachmann's talking about abolishing the feds, that Rick Perry's talking about it, that they're having to try to become Ron Paul just to be popular, tells you what we already know from our research, but what the mainstream media tries to buffalo the public with and keep from you.
[00:27:33.607 --> 00:27:44.252]  That an anti-New World Order, pro-America, pro-sovereignty, pro-free market awakening is the majority now.
[00:27:44.252 --> 00:27:49.414]  Of thinking political people, the majority is awake.
[00:27:49.414 --> 00:27:56.517]  And the final domino to fall is that the majority does not know it's a majority.
[00:27:56.517 --> 00:28:01.779]  Ladies and gentlemen, anywhere I go,
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:13.329]  Anywhere I travel in the world now, I can't walk a hundred feet down a hallway or down a street without people stopping and talking to me.
[00:28:14.437 --> 00:28:19.160]  They're just as intelligent, better looking, probably smarter than I am.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.462]  Why aren't you leading a fight against the globalists?
[00:28:22.462 --> 00:28:24.763]  And it doesn't mean you're going to save the world by yourself either.
[00:28:24.763 --> 00:28:26.984]  But why aren't you seeing yourself?
[00:28:26.984 --> 00:28:29.586]  It's always, we're so glad you're there, Alex.
[00:28:29.586 --> 00:28:32.027]  We're so glad you're fighting.
[00:28:32.027 --> 00:28:34.449]  I sleep better at night knowing you're there.
[00:28:34.449 --> 00:28:40.592]  I'm here to wake people up and then spur you to be the leaders you are.
[00:28:40.592 --> 00:28:41.773]  Nothing is going to happen.
[00:28:43.504 --> 00:28:46.046]  Until you take action.
[00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:50.951]  And I look at these men with their young, beautiful wives and their healthy, happy children.
[00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:56.075]  And I talk to them, I watch them talk to each other.
[00:28:56.075 --> 00:28:58.297]  All they talk about is sports.
[00:28:58.297 --> 00:28:59.959]  All they talk about is entertainment.
[00:28:59.959 --> 00:29:02.181]  They are not men.
[00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:04.362]  They are not men.
[00:29:04.362 --> 00:29:07.165]  They are little boys who never grew up.
[00:29:07.165 --> 00:29:10.328]  The women behave like tarts.
[00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:18.595]  Who are not guardians of their family, but are just little kids out to have a good time.
[00:29:18.595 --> 00:29:25.165]  Listen, America has gotten in trouble because most people don't see it as their role.
[00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:27.108]  They don't see it as their job.
[00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:32.917]  They don't see it as something that they do to be politically involved.
[00:29:32.917 --> 00:29:38.079]  You better get politically involved or become totally enslaved.
[00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:46.302]  When you're not involved, the vacuum is filled by criminals, control freaks, con men, and every form of tyranny you can imagine.
[00:29:46.302 --> 00:29:50.724]  I want to talk to military, police, and others when we come back.
[00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:52.125]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:54.646]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:57.327]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:03.217]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.217 --> 00:30:08.520]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.061]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:18.866]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:27.128]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.128 --> 00:30:35.130]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:40.352]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:30:40.352 --> 00:30:42.512]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:48.519]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:50.763]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:30:50.763 --> 00:30:53.007]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.261]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:08.186]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.186 --> 00:31:10.748]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.748 --> 00:31:15.912]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.112 --> 00:31:19.153]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.153 --> 00:31:21.473]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.473 --> 00:31:27.714]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.714 --> 00:31:31.095]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.095 --> 00:31:36.876]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:36.876 --> 00:31:38.517]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.517 --> 00:31:39.817]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:39.817 --> 00:31:42.498]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.498 --> 00:31:43.898]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:31:44.138 --> 00:31:44.538]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:03.434]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:32:03.434 --> 00:32:08.037]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[00:32:08.037 --> 00:32:15.522]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[00:32:15.522 --> 00:32:16.243]  For a limited time, you get 30
[00:32:18.484 --> 00:32:18.844]  We're good.
[00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:37.619]  I think so.
[00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:32.593]  All right.
[00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:36.535]  I'm gonna be opening the phones up.
[00:33:36.535 --> 00:33:39.116]  I have Max Keiser joining us and then Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:33:40.327 --> 00:33:56.398]  Specifically asking police, military, private intelligence gathering folks, I mean, are you really going to buy that we've got to give up all of our rights because of an al-Qaeda threat that we have a better chance of dying from a honeybee sting domestically from terror?
[00:33:56.398 --> 00:34:00.401]  Okay, well if you're going to buy that, now you're going to buy that the Tea Party are the terrorists?
[00:34:00.401 --> 00:34:09.327]  I told you there was going to be a rollout to rebrand terror threat to be Christian, conservative, rural, libertarian type Americans.
[00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:15.542]  And now it's happening.
[00:34:15.542 --> 00:34:25.355]  And you can read the report at DrudgeReport.com, the latest propaganda being put out by Homeland Security, where all the terrorists are white and the good guys are the minorities.
[00:34:27.073 --> 00:34:29.474]  I mean, are you buying this?
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:31.155]  Or are you upset about it?
[00:34:31.155 --> 00:34:41.300]  Are you upset about all the White House memos that are public about how great a terror attack would be, and how all these advisors to Obama are saying, you need a terror attack, Mr. President.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:53.906]  They think you're so stupid, that in plain view, they put out all these memos, and all these talking points about how great a terror attack would be, and how they need to blame it on the Tea Party types.
[00:34:57.256 --> 00:35:03.879]  And now they're doing the public rollout.
[00:35:03.879 --> 00:35:06.480]  This horse is about to leave the barn.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.481]  The train is about to leave the station.
[00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:14.603]  They've moved from quietly beta testing it behind the scenes to a full public rollout.
[00:35:14.603 --> 00:35:16.624]  To terror America!
[00:35:16.624 --> 00:35:18.485]  Forget about the bankers raping you.
[00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:20.906]  Forget about the country being destroyed financially.
[00:35:20.906 --> 00:35:22.606]  Forget about the open borders.
[00:35:22.606 --> 00:35:23.887]  It's the domestic threat.
[00:35:23.887 --> 00:35:25.307]  It's those dirty Tea Partiers.
[00:35:27.176 --> 00:35:28.176]  259-9231.
[00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:42.202]  Now, I want to get into some of the economic news, just a smattering of it, because we're going to get more in-depth with Max Keiser when he joins us.
[00:35:42.202 --> 00:35:42.922]  But obviously,
[00:35:44.252 --> 00:35:48.674]  Stocks are bouncing between 380 points and 450 points down.
[00:35:48.674 --> 00:35:53.595]  It's down 383 points right now on the Dow.
[00:35:53.595 --> 00:35:58.637]  And it's plunging on news that there's dollar devaluation and global inflation.
[00:35:58.637 --> 00:36:03.519]  So CNN and others are going from denying there's any inflation to admitting it.
[00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:05.760]  Jobless claims are way up.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.361]  Gasoline lifts consumer prices.
[00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:11.282]  CNBC increasing inflation.
[00:36:11.282 --> 00:36:11.822]  No kidding.
[00:36:13.584 --> 00:36:19.329]  Meanwhile, the University of Texas in the last year has bought over a billion and a half dollars of gold.
[00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:20.950]  Other major universities in the U.S.
[00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:27.475]  and around the world are dumping dollars and treasury notes and other major currencies and buying gold.
[00:36:27.475 --> 00:36:31.519]  They're also buying one other currency, the Swiss franc.
[00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:35.302]  The Swiss tried to devalue their currency this week.
[00:36:35.302 --> 00:36:36.303]  Guess what that caused?
[00:36:37.173 --> 00:36:42.419]  It to go up even more as governments, institutions and private individuals flooded in.
[00:36:42.419 --> 00:36:59.376]  What country is the only nation on earth that is still 100% sovereign and has a sound monetary system and their economy is booming so, so fast that the average Swiss person is the most wealthy per capita in the world?
[00:36:59.376 --> 00:36:59.797]  Switzerland.
[00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:03.069]  They are sovereign.
[00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:07.312]  They are the model that our country was founded on with the militia.
[00:37:07.312 --> 00:37:10.434]  If you didn't know that, George Washington didn't invent it.
[00:37:12.853 --> 00:37:14.234]  It's Switzerland.
[00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:19.498]  Grenade launchers, machine guns, bonkers in every town.
[00:37:19.498 --> 00:37:22.800]  Basically, they're European rednecks is how they're described.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.082]  I've got a lot of friends and family that have lived over in Switzerland.
[00:37:25.082 --> 00:37:30.786]  Great people, smart, they can skin a buck, run a trot line, they hate the New World Order.
[00:37:30.786 --> 00:37:35.970]  Most of their mainline politicians openly talk about the Bilderberg Group and the New World Order.
[00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.813]  They've got their head screwed on straight, so they're rolling around in money.
[00:37:40.273 --> 00:37:42.034]  They're rolling around in firearms.
[00:37:42.034 --> 00:37:44.276]  They're rolling around in private property.
[00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:48.939]  The police say, yes sir and yes ma'am.
[00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:50.219]  Because it's their country.
[00:37:50.219 --> 00:37:53.622]  They don't want to live in a country where the police are total thugs.
[00:37:53.622 --> 00:37:55.663]  They're guardians of their republic.
[00:37:55.663 --> 00:38:00.166]  Oh, we could have all that back, but see, we wanted globalism.
[00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:01.747]  We wanted the New World Order.
[00:38:01.747 --> 00:38:02.808]  We wanted NAFTA and GATT.
[00:38:02.808 --> 00:38:04.549]  It was going to be so good, Al Gore said.
[00:38:06.448 --> 00:38:13.415]  Now, following this trend, South Koreans are grabbing massive tonnage of gold.
[00:38:13.415 --> 00:38:15.076]  Every day I see other nations doing it.
[00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:17.258]  Here's one out of the Financial Times of London.
[00:38:17.258 --> 00:38:20.621]  Venezuela to nationalize gold industry.
[00:38:20.621 --> 00:38:21.983]  President Hugo Chavez.
[00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:24.839]  I saw a photo of him with no hair now.
[00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:26.500]  He looks like Lex Luthor.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.480]  Lex Luthor.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:39.204]  President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday that he will nationalize Venezuela's gold industry in a bid to stamp out illegal mining and boost international reserves.
[00:38:39.204 --> 00:38:51.248]  We don't want war with anyone, but we have to defend our country, said the former tank commander during an address to the army as he was presenting them with newly purchased Russian military equipment.
[00:38:51.248 --> 00:38:51.648]  Oh boy.
[00:38:52.518 --> 00:39:00.261]  Here's another one, Chavez emptying Bank of England vaults as Venezuela brings back Goldhoard.
[00:39:00.261 --> 00:39:13.566]  Every government out there, every Fortune 500 company, every major university that's got big reserves, like the University of Texas has got close to $100 billion, they've squeezed out of the population.
[00:39:13.566 --> 00:39:17.128]  Gotta love it, state-funded, biggest landowner in the state that's private.
[00:39:18.508 --> 00:39:21.509]  Always going up on tuition, always going up.
[00:39:21.509 --> 00:39:26.551]  And the University of Texas bought a half billion, another billion in gold in the last year.
[00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:31.053]  Chavez emptying Bank of England's vault as Venezuela brings back gold hoard.
[00:39:31.053 --> 00:39:43.917]  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ordered the Central Bank to repatriate 11 billion of gold reserves held in developed nations institutions such as the Bank of England as the metal rises to record levels.
[00:39:44.477 --> 00:39:55.862]  Venezuela, which holds 211 tons, or 365 tons of gold reserves, the US, European, Canada, and Swiss institutions will progressively return the bars to the central bank's vault.
[00:39:55.862 --> 00:40:03.186]  The UN just ordered all of its staff out of the UN embassy in Syria yesterday.
[00:40:03.186 --> 00:40:06.827]  The whole world sliding towards World War III.
[00:40:06.827 --> 00:40:10.409]  It's going to be regional wars all over the planet.
[00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:12.330]  That's what's been called for by the globalists.
[00:40:13.171 --> 00:40:16.794]  With the United States fighting Russian proxies all over.
[00:40:16.794 --> 00:40:18.835]  Not for America, but for the big banks.
[00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:22.298]  It's unbelievable.
[00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.511]  Move to curb Swiss francs rise backfires.
[00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:34.453]  Traders shrugged off new measures by Swiss authorities to stem demand for their currency, setting the Swiss franc sharply higher yesterday and today.
[00:40:34.453 --> 00:40:45.677]  The Swiss franc jumped 2% against both the euro and the dollar in a matter of minutes as traders ignored the Swiss National Bank's decision to almost double the amount of liquidity available to the money markets.
[00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:48.878]  So they tried to devalue their currency and the world said no.
[00:40:48.878 --> 00:40:52.399]  Look, your population has access to grenade launchers.
[00:40:54.195 --> 00:40:55.837]  You've got machine guns everywhere.
[00:40:55.837 --> 00:40:57.018]  You've got private property.
[00:40:57.018 --> 00:41:00.040]  You're not under the globalist parasite control.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.923]  The globalists themselves want to invest in Switzerland.
[00:41:02.923 --> 00:41:06.566]  They want somewhere not destroyed by them to run to.
[00:41:06.566 --> 00:41:08.949]  A small little island, a little Eden.
[00:41:11.525 --> 00:41:14.006]  Okay, I want to get to your phone calls.
[00:41:14.006 --> 00:41:16.627]  That's just some of the financial news.
[00:41:16.627 --> 00:41:25.450]  And again, when Kaiser joins us, we're going to get to Justin, Evan, James, John, Joe, you guys here in just a moment.
[00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.391]  I don't want to tell you what's coming up with Kaiser.
[00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:31.672]  Do you realize that the government is still paying banks not to lend?
[00:41:31.672 --> 00:41:33.352]  This is from the Business Insider.
[00:41:33.352 --> 00:41:34.353]  It's up at Infowars.com.
[00:41:36.775 --> 00:41:48.304]  And prisonplanet.com and actually link to the Federal Reserve's own website and other news reports where they admit that they pay banks not to lend to you.
[00:41:48.304 --> 00:41:58.453]  You wonder why you've heard they've given them tens of trillions of bailout money, your tax money, to get the economy going three years ago and then you can't get a car loan even if you got decent credit, you can't get loans.
[00:41:58.453 --> 00:41:59.554]  I know a lot of people
[00:42:00.336 --> 00:42:02.178]  Who can't get loans.
[00:42:02.178 --> 00:42:05.541]  One of my crew makes decent living, a great video editor.
[00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:09.165]  He's gotten raises over the years.
[00:42:09.165 --> 00:42:14.089]  He was trying to get a car, a new used car.
[00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:19.194]  He wanted a Jeep so he could go out in the hill country and stuff with his girlfriend.
[00:42:19.194 --> 00:42:20.856]  And he likes to camp and stuff.
[00:42:22.577 --> 00:42:40.534]  He was like six months ago, he kept going to Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, his buddy, JP Morgan, all those big banks trying to get a loan and he has good credit and he's had a job here for six years and they said, no, we're not giving you a loan.
[00:42:44.696 --> 00:42:47.998]  I said, Rob, go to a credit union, man.
[00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:51.420]  That's a real bank owned by real people.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.561]  They're in the business of lending.
[00:42:52.561 --> 00:42:59.184]  The mega banks are laying off all their retail employees, most of them.
[00:42:59.184 --> 00:43:00.285]  They run America.
[00:43:00.285 --> 00:43:03.687]  They don't want to loan you a business loan or a car loan.
[00:43:03.687 --> 00:43:07.809]  He walked right in, got a super low rate, walked right out, got the Jeep.
[00:43:07.809 --> 00:43:11.231]  He said, wow, how'd you know that?
[00:43:11.231 --> 00:43:12.572]  Because I understand what's going on.
[00:43:14.246 --> 00:43:20.949]  The issue here is that they're here to hurt you.
[00:43:20.949 --> 00:43:22.770]  They want to destroy the economy.
[00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.651]  That's how they conquer it.
[00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:25.631]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:43:25.631 --> 00:43:28.533]  Also, we're going to look into child poverty in the U.S.
[00:43:28.533 --> 00:43:30.654]  has increased 18% in the last nine years.
[00:43:30.654 --> 00:43:32.275]  That's what government cook numbers.
[00:43:32.275 --> 00:43:34.055]  Again, government's doing a great job.
[00:43:34.055 --> 00:43:35.916]  People say, oh, they're doing a horrible job.
[00:43:35.916 --> 00:43:39.478]  No, the government's not doing a bad job in the drug war either.
[00:43:39.478 --> 00:43:43.380]  They're making 500 bill a year, bringing the drugs in and keeping them illegal to keep the price up.
[00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:49.011]  So one in five American children now living in poverty, according to a new report.
[00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:51.552]  This is, everything is going according to plan.
[00:43:51.552 --> 00:43:56.213]  That's how we've been able to predict everything that would happen, because the globalists are following a program.
[00:43:56.213 --> 00:44:07.078]  I mean, this is, we can tell you what's gonna happen, because they all write white papers like you're idiots, and they think you won't read what they've written.
[00:44:07.078 --> 00:44:12.740]  By the way, there's a news article about chemicals being put in hair care products to reduce fertility.
[00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:22.492]  And I thought I would do some research and just pull up some of the older reports on this, because it's getting a lot of attention and people are saying, is it true or isn't it?
[00:44:22.492 --> 00:44:24.452]  Of course it's true.
[00:44:24.452 --> 00:44:26.213]  This deals with Israel.
[00:44:26.213 --> 00:44:32.774]  Reportedly trying to ship hair care products that sterilize and poison people in Egypt and folks are freaking out about it.
[00:44:32.774 --> 00:44:38.576]  Even Israeli news isn't denying it, they're just... But the point is, it's all the major governments are doing this.
[00:44:38.576 --> 00:44:39.976]  This is the global policy.
[00:44:41.258 --> 00:44:44.499]  Israel was paid the equivalent of what?
[00:44:44.499 --> 00:44:46.100]  Four billion U.S.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:54.443]  dollars in the 50s and early 60s to radiate 110,000 Jewish children, many of them to death.
[00:44:54.443 --> 00:44:59.605]  So yes, if Israel's murdering their own children and brain damaging them, they're going to be doing it to the Arabs next door.
[00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:01.486]  But again, people say, oh see, Israel's pure evil.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.801]  No, the Israeli people aren't evil, their government is.
[00:45:05.801 --> 00:45:08.262]  The Chinese people aren't evil, their government is.
[00:45:08.262 --> 00:45:11.483]  The American people, on average, aren't evil, the government is.
[00:45:11.483 --> 00:45:12.823]  It's all of them.
[00:45:12.823 --> 00:45:19.845]  It's all of the modern governments that are run by the big megabanks are all doing this.
[00:45:19.845 --> 00:45:24.946]  In fact, I shouldn't even mention that without backing it up.
[00:45:24.946 --> 00:45:29.728]  LA Times, dirty money, BPA on dollar bills, reducing fertility, LA Times.
[00:45:31.877 --> 00:46:00.808]  EWG.org Synthetic Estrogen BPA Coach Cash Register Receipts Massively Reducing Fertility Increasing Cancer Environmental Working Group Best Phenol Overview Massive Population Reduction Synthetic Hormone BPA Exposure Linked to Low Sperm Count That's out of AP
[00:46:02.469 --> 00:46:02.889]  Study.
[00:46:02.889 --> 00:46:04.550]  BPA may reduce sperm count.
[00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.450]  Health.com.
[00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:09.192]  BPA lowers male fertility.
[00:46:09.192 --> 00:46:10.453]  Essence.
[00:46:10.453 --> 00:46:12.694]  Science News.
[00:46:12.694 --> 00:46:13.514]  Okay.
[00:46:13.514 --> 00:46:14.655]  Now.
[00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:16.836]  Now, now.
[00:46:16.836 --> 00:46:18.817]  Now, I've covered that.
[00:46:18.817 --> 00:46:19.297]  Oh, here it is.
[00:46:19.297 --> 00:46:20.097]  I'm sorry.
[00:46:20.097 --> 00:46:22.618]  This is out of Ynet News.
[00:46:22.618 --> 00:46:24.119]  Big Israeli news.
[00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:26.940]  Mossad plotted to harm Egyptian fertility.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.442]  Egypt's Al-Haram Daily claims Israel
[00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:43.773]  Accused spies, the Afir Harari, accused of spying for Israel, devised to sell Egypt hair care products, endangering reproductive abilities.
[00:46:43.773 --> 00:46:47.294]  And then it goes on from there.
[00:46:47.294 --> 00:46:49.295]  Of course!
[00:46:49.295 --> 00:46:50.476]  This is being done to everybody!
[00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:52.637]  This is being done to the Israelis!
[00:46:52.637 --> 00:46:53.937]  It's being done to everyone!
[00:46:53.937 --> 00:46:54.978]  You're all under attack!
[00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:56.800]  Okay?
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:02.989]  Only the eugenicists, and there's probably only 10,000 of them max, who really know what's going on.
[00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:08.316]  Rothkopf says there's 6,000 in the superclass, in his book, Superclass, former head of the Kissinger Group.
[00:47:08.316 --> 00:47:10.499]  And this is what it's all about.
[00:47:11.738 --> 00:47:17.182]  And it doesn't matter if you're German, Jewish, Chinese, Mexican, Aboriginal, it doesn't matter.
[00:47:17.182 --> 00:47:19.184]  You're not getting the memo about this.
[00:47:19.184 --> 00:47:22.386]  We're all under attack by the eugenicists.
[00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:23.567]  The eugenicists.
[00:47:23.567 --> 00:47:31.493]  Forget all your Muslim-Christian clashes, Jew-Muslim clashes, Catholic-Protestant clashes.
[00:47:31.493 --> 00:47:34.655]  All of this is just a diversion, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:34.655 --> 00:47:39.899]  The real global religion is eugenics carried out by the elite against everyone but them.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.041]  All right, enough said.
[00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:46.866]  I'm going to go to Justin, Evan, James, John, Joe, and others here in a moment.
[00:47:46.866 --> 00:47:49.348]  And we got Max Keiser coming up in about 45 minutes from now.
[00:47:49.348 --> 00:47:55.614]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up, obviously give people another opportunity to get silver and gold.
[00:47:56.887 --> 00:47:57.287]  I think?
[00:48:13.905 --> 00:48:18.110]  Ted, I tell you, this is scary how they're devaluing the dollar.
[00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:25.138]  And the Vice President over there in China on his knees today publicly begging the CHICOMS to continue to buy U.S.
[00:48:25.138 --> 00:48:32.966]  Treasuries and prop up the dollar for now while they go ahead with the schizophrenic policy themselves of devaluing it.
[00:48:32.966 --> 00:48:34.128]  Where is gold right now, Ted?
[00:48:34.741 --> 00:48:38.003]  Well, gold hit a high today of $18.2780, currently trading at $18.2020, up $30.20.
[00:48:38.003 --> 00:48:42.025]  Of course, like you said, the stock market is just tumbling right now.
[00:48:42.025 --> 00:48:43.206]  Silver hit a high of $41.02, $40.71 presently.
[00:48:43.206 --> 00:48:44.647]  I mean, there's just... I mean, the markets are just...
[00:48:55.313 --> 00:48:57.375]  Just gyrating like crazy.
[00:48:57.375 --> 00:49:06.866]  Of course, the news from Bloomberg is that Wall Street tumbles on economy bank worries, which means that there could be possible bank runs, you know?
[00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:11.471]  I guess if the Fed continues to print money, and so there's money to get out in the system, that won't happen.
[00:49:11.471 --> 00:49:15.576]  But the inflation fear is driving people to gold, and that isn't going to stop.
[00:49:15.896 --> 00:49:17.697]  Now we've broken through $1,820 an ounce.
[00:49:17.697 --> 00:49:22.260]  We're heading to $1,900 very fast.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.303]  It is now, you know, late August, or at least mid to late August.
[00:49:26.303 --> 00:49:28.644]  And we haven't even seen September, October, November yet.
[00:49:28.644 --> 00:49:28.984]  That's right.
[00:49:28.984 --> 00:49:34.468]  Usually October, November, December is the Super Bowl market for gold going into February.
[00:49:34.468 --> 00:49:37.510]  But if you look at the 12-year graph, it's been bull for 11 1⁄2, 12 years.
[00:49:39.511 --> 00:49:49.160]  But Ted, expanding on this, JP Morgan said they believe gold will hit $2,500 or more by end of December.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.783]  So we're talking three, four months from now.
[00:49:51.783 --> 00:49:55.686]  Ted, they are at the top of the pyramid.
[00:49:55.686 --> 00:49:57.969]  They are definitely at the top of the pyramid, Alex.
[00:49:57.969 --> 00:50:04.194]  I mean, they created the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Federal Reserve Bank is the bank that handles the printing press.
[00:50:04.795 --> 00:50:07.117]  You know, they're the ones that... And they signal they're going to kill it.
[00:50:07.117 --> 00:50:12.020]  Now, I know you've got deals where you get a free book and a free video and free shipping with two silver dollars.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.822]  Incredibly insane deal.
[00:50:13.822 --> 00:50:16.504]  You continue to just sell thousands of those a week.
[00:50:16.504 --> 00:50:17.644]  That's a great loss leader.
[00:50:17.644 --> 00:50:21.447]  But what about folks who just want a great deal on silver and regular gold coins?
[00:50:21.447 --> 00:50:23.529]  I know there's a big list of radio specials.
[00:50:23.529 --> 00:50:24.549]  Folks can call for those.
[00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.609]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:24.709]  800-686-237.
[00:50:24.709 --> 00:50:27.832]  What are some of your best smoking specials right now, Ted?
[00:50:32.395 --> 00:50:37.479]  Well, Silver Bags of Dime, $3,029 delivered.
[00:50:37.479 --> 00:50:38.380]  U.S.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.102]  Eagles, $19.49 presently.
[00:50:40.102 --> 00:50:41.883]  Franks, small pieces of gold, $3.96.
[00:50:41.883 --> 00:50:46.507]  You know, there's just a lot of great deals right now that you should be getting into.
[00:50:46.507 --> 00:50:50.271]  But that $83 for two silver dollars, that video and the book.
[00:50:51.543 --> 00:50:54.304]  That's just smoking hot because I haven't raised the prices yet.
[00:50:54.304 --> 00:50:55.565]  Summer's gone up.
[00:50:55.565 --> 00:50:56.485]  It's white hot!
[00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:59.226]  It's not even red hot!
[00:50:59.226 --> 00:50:59.346]  800-686-237.
[00:50:59.346 --> 00:50:59.986]  Thank you, Ted.
[00:50:59.986 --> 00:51:00.666]  Call straight ahead.
[00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:05.888]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:51:15.252 --> 00:51:21.114]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and re-cleanable black purification elements that purify water
[00:51:21.274 --> 00:51:29.566]  By removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:46.321]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:51:46.321 --> 00:51:47.962]  Or order online at GoBerkey.com.
[00:51:47.962 --> 00:51:48.902]  That's GoBerkey.com today!
[00:52:00.407 --> 00:52:05.971]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:52:05.971 --> 00:52:14.238]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking minds, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:52:14.238 --> 00:52:26.227]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:52:26.227 --> 00:52:30.230]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news
[00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.610]  We're good.
[00:53:00.416 --> 00:53:06.799]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[00:53:06.799 --> 00:53:07.459]  I lost 20 pounds.
[00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:08.260]  I lost 40 pounds.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.721]  I lost 55 pounds.
[00:53:09.721 --> 00:53:11.461]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[00:53:15.106 --> 00:53:21.991]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[00:53:21.991 --> 00:53:25.653]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:53:25.653 --> 00:53:29.736]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[00:53:29.736 --> 00:53:36.261]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:53:36.661 --> 00:53:44.849]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[00:53:51.955 --> 00:53:52.175]  That's 1-800-737-9107.
[00:53:52.175 --> 00:53:52.235]  1-800-737-9107.
[00:54:12.229 --> 00:54:14.911]  Alright, Max Keiser is coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:54:14.911 --> 00:54:19.975]  I'm going to take phone calls and intersperse key military news.
[00:54:19.975 --> 00:54:22.256]  Of course you know, record number now of U.S.
[00:54:22.256 --> 00:54:25.979]  troops killed in Afghanistan in a huge bombing today.
[00:54:25.979 --> 00:54:28.981]  They should not be in that war to guard the opium.
[00:54:28.981 --> 00:54:31.503]  They should be back home protecting our borders.
[00:54:31.503 --> 00:54:33.605]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:54:33.605 --> 00:54:35.246]  It's nothing more than an opium war.
[00:54:35.246 --> 00:54:37.407]  It's a fight with different militant groups.
[00:54:38.288 --> 00:54:46.875]  Like Mohammed Karzai's brother who just got killed a few months ago over who's getting that smack and that $500 billion.
[00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:49.197]  $500 billion a year in opium comes out of there to the whole world.
[00:54:49.197 --> 00:54:55.803]  $500 billion total in narcotics shipped into the U.S., cocaine and heroin and other nasty things.
[00:54:55.803 --> 00:54:59.386]  And by keeping them illegal, it drives up the price, which is the reason they do it.
[00:54:59.386 --> 00:55:04.990]  But if you just joined us, I've asked for military police, former military contractors to call in
[00:55:06.111 --> 00:55:06.952]  And give us your take.
[00:55:06.952 --> 00:55:07.912]  I mean, now it's public.
[00:55:07.912 --> 00:55:09.053]  They've rebranded.
[00:55:09.053 --> 00:55:10.194]  It's not the Muslim threat.
[00:55:10.194 --> 00:55:11.975]  It's now the evil Tea Party.
[00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:12.675]  They're terrorists.
[00:55:12.675 --> 00:55:13.916]  They're about to hit us.
[00:55:13.916 --> 00:55:17.639]  Now, how asinine is it that the Tea Party is going to engage in terror?
[00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:23.362]  A. And B, how were they hyping it years ago, behind the scenes?
[00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:25.544]  Now they're rolling it out public.
[00:55:25.544 --> 00:55:27.765]  Clearly, this is all staged.
[00:55:27.765 --> 00:55:29.627]  And do you agree with me that they're getting ready to
[00:55:30.757 --> 00:55:34.263]  Start staging false flags here in the country.
[00:55:34.263 --> 00:55:36.166]  800-259-9231.
[00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:41.494]  Our report that went out yesterday afternoon is on the Drudge Report.
[00:55:41.494 --> 00:55:42.796]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:55:42.796 --> 00:55:45.540]  I'm very thankful for Drudge recognizing this as important news.
[00:55:46.422 --> 00:55:47.723]  Uh, and getting it up.
[00:55:47.723 --> 00:55:55.575]  I rarely fire the Batman, uh, uh, light into the night sky, but a few times I have asked drugs to link to something they have.
[00:55:55.575 --> 00:55:59.941]  So I want to thank the great crew over there at reg report.com because it's admitted.
[00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:01.863]  I already knew this myself just from watching it.
[00:56:02.444 --> 00:56:10.647]  But the New York Times and others have had to admit the Drudge Report drives more traffic than Facebook and YouTube combined, more than Twitter.
[00:56:10.647 --> 00:56:17.910]  I mean, it is the only place in the world that can truly now punch something out and make it a top story.
[00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.391]  And it's just incredible.
[00:56:20.391 --> 00:56:28.114]  So if you scroll down at DrudgeReport.com, on the right-hand side, you can see our report, Big Sis Latest Terrorist.
[00:56:29.068 --> 00:56:33.832]  More white Americans and remind me to get Watson on the line.
[00:56:33.832 --> 00:56:42.298]  I want to write a update article to that and add it as a link to the top of our latest article because it's a great article Watson wrote but it doesn't point out.
[00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:44.419]  It does but it needs to state it.
[00:56:44.419 --> 00:56:51.444]  If there was any doubt the other promo videos they put out to Fairmonger were saying white people are the new terrorist.
[00:56:51.444 --> 00:56:53.806]  This new one just it just it just continues.
[00:56:53.806 --> 00:56:55.768]  This is a month after the last controversy.
[00:56:56.539 --> 00:56:58.200]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.643]  Imagine if you put out a bunch of government videos where only black people were terrorists, or only Asians.
[00:57:03.643 --> 00:57:05.464]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:10.866]  But it's now been confirmed that all over the country there are racial attacks against whites happening.
[00:57:10.866 --> 00:57:18.250]  It's now been confirmed by police, by videos, by the criminals themselves, that, well, they think it's okay to attack a white person.
[00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:21.832]  And that's the same thing where a Klan person thinks it's okay to attack a black person.
[00:57:22.392 --> 00:57:29.616]  You know, I decry that when people attack folks from a bestial, tribal, gang level.
[00:57:29.616 --> 00:57:31.517]  But why is it okay when whites are attacked?
[00:57:31.517 --> 00:57:33.959]  Well, it's okay to say whites are terrorists.
[00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:36.640]  See, I'm sick of it and I'm not putting up with it.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.082]  And this is political correctness to the power of 10 billion.
[00:57:39.682 --> 00:57:43.344]  All right, let's go to, this is a short segment, but I'm going to come back to everybody.
[00:57:43.344 --> 00:57:44.725]  Justin in California.
[00:57:44.725 --> 00:57:46.766]  No, he hasn't been holding the longest.
[00:57:46.766 --> 00:57:47.487]  I'm sorry.
[00:57:47.487 --> 00:57:49.388]  James in Arizona, we'll hold you over.
[00:57:49.388 --> 00:57:52.109]  Former military, listening to us on the internet.
[00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:54.090]  What's your take on all this?
[00:57:54.090 --> 00:58:02.015]  Well, yeah, I've been listening to you for a while now since the election because I saw the stock market, you know, crash and it just didn't make sense.
[00:58:02.015 --> 00:58:08.719]  So I started doing some research and listening to you, but I'm a former Marine and, you know, I woke up when I watched the Obama deception.
[00:58:09.573 --> 00:58:13.000]  And yeah, I've got friends in the military, a lot of former military friends.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:22.404]  And for the most part, we all know, and I wake up all my marine friends, they don't buy the Navy SEAL going down, they don't buy any of it.
[00:58:22.404 --> 00:58:24.885]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you back in one minute.
[00:58:24.885 --> 00:58:28.106]  Folks, I didn't make a big deal about this last week.
[00:58:28.106 --> 00:58:33.348]  In fact, one segment I said I'm going to come back and talk about it and I forgot because I got distracted and didn't.
[00:58:33.348 --> 00:58:39.571]  I have it directly from the father of a Navy SEAL who we've known for years that the SEALs don't buy it either.
[00:58:44.332 --> 00:58:51.774]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.774 --> 00:58:55.796]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.796 --> 00:58:59.037]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.037 --> 00:59:04.198]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:04.198 --> 00:59:10.220]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.461]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:13.321]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.321 --> 00:59:13.842]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:14.502]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.502 --> 00:59:15.783]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.783 --> 00:59:18.024]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.912 --> 00:59:34.054]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.054 --> 00:59:39.198]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.198 --> 00:59:53.510]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.892]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.675]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:06.537]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:08.318]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.318 --> 01:00:10.079]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:11.660]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.201]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:17.403]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.403 --> 01:00:21.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:28.866]  All right, we got Max Keiser on the imploding stock markets worldwide joining us in 30 minutes.
[01:00:28.866 --> 01:00:32.308]  Justin, Evan, James, John, Raul, others.
[01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.852]  Who are former military, current military, police.
[01:00:37.852 --> 01:00:45.258]  I want your view on the public rebranding that conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans, and white people are the new number one threat.
[01:00:45.258 --> 01:00:46.759]  The White House has said it.
[01:00:46.759 --> 01:00:47.920]  The Vice President said it.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.484]  They got TV ads now running.
[01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:57.107]  Now I've seen six different ones and every one of them, all the terrorists are white.
[01:00:57.107 --> 01:00:59.449]  Those reporting them are minorities.
[01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:00.249]  I mean, this is...
[01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.531]  This is crazy.
[01:01:02.531 --> 01:01:04.652]  So they're rolling it out that everybody's a terrorist.
[01:01:04.652 --> 01:01:06.533]  They've already taught us the brown people are terrorists.
[01:01:06.533 --> 01:01:09.274]  And whites said, yeah, well, it's only for the brown people.
[01:01:09.274 --> 01:01:11.495]  Well, now you're learning it's for everybody.
[01:01:11.495 --> 01:01:13.056]  And I told you this was coming.
[01:01:13.056 --> 01:01:17.518]  Justin got out of the Marines, a Marine veteran, but he has friends that are Marines currently.
[01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:18.959]  And he says they're waking up.
[01:01:18.959 --> 01:01:20.680]  They don't buy the Navy SEALs.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.861]  Helicopter going down.
[01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:22.501]  Please continue.
[01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:25.468]  I'm sorry, it was James.
[01:01:25.468 --> 01:01:29.330]  I'm sorry, the phone system says Justin.
[01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.932]  I love Harmon, but he loves to torture me by putting the wrong name in there.
[01:01:32.932 --> 01:01:34.533]  I'm just joking.
[01:01:34.533 --> 01:01:39.456]  Yeah, a lot of the military veterans, every one of them I know, is like, forget this.
[01:01:39.456 --> 01:01:40.317]  This is a joke.
[01:01:40.317 --> 01:01:42.978]  Air Force, Navy, Marines especially.
[01:01:42.978 --> 01:01:44.519]  Especially the Marines.
[01:01:44.519 --> 01:01:46.680]  And the Marines that are still in, they're all waking up.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.261]  We're all contacting our friends.
[01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:50.783]  I predicted to Anders Brevik, I told the
[01:01:51.451 --> 01:01:58.554]  My friends in the military, hey, they're going to stage white terror attacks over in Europe and then they're going to start doing them in the U.S.
[01:01:58.554 --> 01:01:59.415]  It happened.
[01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.235]  They texted me.
[01:02:00.235 --> 01:02:01.356]  They're all believing me now.
[01:02:01.356 --> 01:02:02.956]  And I tell you, the U.S.
[01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:05.798]  military is waking up and they screwed with the wrong people.
[01:02:06.826 --> 01:02:08.888]  Well, and by the way, it wasn't Harmon messed up.
[01:02:08.888 --> 01:02:13.272]  They've got a new phone system that's all computerized and fancy.
[01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:14.333]  And I went to James.
[01:02:14.333 --> 01:02:15.894]  There is a Justin.
[01:02:15.894 --> 01:02:17.235]  You're James in Arizona.
[01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:20.978]  I'm going to Justin in California in a little while.
[01:02:20.978 --> 01:02:23.200]  So I apologize for getting that wrong.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.702]  But I want to go back to what you just said, because that's big.
[01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:49.677]  Because we laid out their battle plan in their internal memos that leaked and others that they were going to stage attacks, I said probably in Europe first, say that right-wingers were doing it so they can continue to destroy Europe's sovereignty and absorb it into the multicultural EU controlled by the bankers who will then play the different groups off against each other as soon as they've got enough foreigners in to be able to checkmate
[01:02:50.377 --> 01:02:51.218]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:02:51.218 --> 01:02:52.659]  I repeated it word for word.
[01:02:52.659 --> 01:02:55.080]  I said they were going to do right-wing attacks in Europe.
[01:03:09.182 --> 01:03:12.446]  And I said that they're going to start piping it over here in the U.S.
[01:03:12.446 --> 01:03:27.465]  and they're seeing it and a lot of them are minorities, a lot of them are like Hispanic or whatever and they're all like, yeah man, this is messed up and they're starting to learn the Constitution and they're talking about it amongst their friends and the Marines are especially picked off of the don't ask, don't tell stuff, but that's a personal issue.
[01:03:28.018 --> 01:03:28.759]  I don't know.
[01:03:42.048 --> 01:03:52.712]  They're starting to see it, because I've been just bashing the message out there, and a lot of former military, and I see why the DHS is so afraid of former military, because we're trained, we're smart, and guess what?
[01:03:52.712 --> 01:03:55.793]  We're the first ones that wake up, and we're getting the message out there.
[01:03:55.793 --> 01:03:56.773]  Well, that is the thing.
[01:03:56.773 --> 01:04:05.376]  People join the military because they want to make a difference, they want to stand up against evil, they have that warrior spirit to defend, and follow that instinct.
[01:04:05.376 --> 01:04:10.838]  The problem is, then you join a system at the top, controlled by the globalists, then you wake up to that,
[01:04:11.278 --> 01:04:12.138]  Now you're the threat.
[01:04:12.138 --> 01:04:19.461]  You're not like these yuppies that just want to act cool all day and, you know, go surfing or play golf.
[01:04:19.461 --> 01:04:21.761]  And I'm not saying playing golf or surfing is bad.
[01:04:21.761 --> 01:04:23.542]  I like it as much as the next person.
[01:04:23.542 --> 01:04:25.583]  The point is that's all they want to do.
[01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:27.983]  They're not going to stand up and speak out.
[01:04:27.983 --> 01:04:33.405]  And they know it's the military type who does have the initiative and is trained to take action.
[01:04:33.405 --> 01:04:34.666]  And they're scared to death of you.
[01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:36.766]  God bless you.
[01:04:36.766 --> 01:04:37.707]  James in Arizona.
[01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.367]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:40.396]  All right.
[01:04:40.396 --> 01:04:49.244]  When we come back, Evan in Michigan, John in Pennsylvania, Raul in Florida, and Justin in California and others, the toll-free number to join us.
[01:04:49.244 --> 01:04:51.525]  I'd like to hear from some police officers on this.
[01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:55.769]  Did I not tell you they were going to switch it from Al Qaeda to the Tea Party?
[01:04:55.769 --> 01:04:57.130]  And now you're seeing it.
[01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:57.711]  I told you.
[01:04:57.711 --> 01:04:58.732]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.704 --> 01:05:03.426]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:08.731]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:10.273]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:19.061]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:27.327]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.327 --> 01:05:35.332]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:40.555]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:40.555 --> 01:05:42.736]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:45.498 --> 01:05:48.703]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:05:48.703 --> 01:05:50.946]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:53.209]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:00.216 --> 01:06:04.759]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.759 --> 01:06:05.680]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:09.103]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.103 --> 01:06:09.963]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:14.847]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:15.607]  It's true.
[01:06:15.607 --> 01:06:20.471]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:21.292]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:24.874]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.874 --> 01:06:28.597]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:29.577]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.577 --> 01:06:32.338]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:36.019]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.019 --> 01:06:36.800]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.961]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:46.003]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:50.184]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.184 --> 01:06:51.964]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:56.566]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:00.509 --> 01:07:07.174]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:07:07.174 --> 01:07:12.317]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:12.317 --> 01:07:21.044]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:21.044 --> 01:07:23.045]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:07:25.097 --> 01:07:27.350]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:34.124]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:07:34.124 --> 01:07:37.945]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:07:37.945 --> 01:07:39.185]  Others don't.

[01:07:41.326 --> 01:07:43.106]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:57.690]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:58.570]  Others don't.
[01:08:02.082 --> 01:08:08.706]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.706 --> 01:08:13.068]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.068 --> 01:08:24.414]  If you miss the last caller, in the last few years, he told all his Marine Corps buddies, he said, you watch, they're going to start staging right-wing attacks in Europe, then it'll come to the United States.
[01:08:24.414 --> 01:08:30.498]  To blame the Tea Party, they're going to rebrand the War on Terror onto Constitutionalists, Ron Paul supporters.
[01:08:31.378 --> 01:08:38.863]  And now that it indeed is happening exactly as I said it would, he said the military is really waking up and freaking out.
[01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:45.008]  You see, it's our power to research history, to study the globalists, it's our capacity
[01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:48.277]  To truly grasp reality.
[01:08:48.277 --> 01:08:50.518]  It's not that hard once you start doing it.
[01:08:50.518 --> 01:08:54.040]  That's what's so scary about this.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.362]  The power of analysis that I have is not hard.
[01:08:57.362 --> 01:09:04.746]  You've just got to be willing to face reality, study history, and after you've studied this for a few years in depth and learned what's real from false and
[01:09:05.806 --> 01:09:09.390]  Then it becomes just absolutely more and more transparent.
[01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:14.815]  It's like a pair of binoculars and you're looking at a deer 200 yards away and you put them up to your eyes.
[01:09:14.815 --> 01:09:16.257]  You got to focus them.
[01:09:16.257 --> 01:09:19.700]  You got to get them set for the spacing of your eyes.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:26.607]  And then as you roll the focus lever and the zoom lever, it comes right into focus.
[01:09:26.607 --> 01:09:29.109]  You're like, wow, how did I not see that before?
[01:09:29.963 --> 01:09:33.565]  You can even see a fly sitting on the deer's ear.
[01:09:33.565 --> 01:09:36.247]  You can see it twitch its ear and the fly fly away.
[01:09:36.247 --> 01:09:39.149]  A couple nights ago I was watching deer with their binoculars.
[01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:40.890]  Hence the analogy.
[01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:42.071]  And it's that simple.
[01:09:42.071 --> 01:09:48.415]  You just gotta bring things into focus and the mainstream media is designed to not bring it into focus.
[01:09:48.415 --> 01:09:52.198]  Oh, people then say, well Alex, why do you then cover mainstream media?
[01:09:52.198 --> 01:09:59.463]  Well, they'll come out and say that stock prices are plunging.
[01:10:00.427 --> 01:10:05.972]  And they'll give you some false reason for why it's happening.
[01:10:05.972 --> 01:10:10.095]  But then buried in the article, they'll admit, also on inflation fears.
[01:10:10.095 --> 01:10:14.999]  So more and more, the information's there, it's just the way they spin it.
[01:10:14.999 --> 01:10:16.020]  There's different types of stuff.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:25.788]  There's outright lies that the media engages in, like when they said that Rand Paul wasn't a medical doctor, or when they said he kidnapped women.
[01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.490]  Those were outright dirty trick lies.
[01:10:28.479 --> 01:10:37.543]  But then there's other types of deception where they lie by omission, where they only tell you part of the story, or they spin the information that's there.
[01:10:37.543 --> 01:10:44.546]  And so one of the biggest things that people detract from the show is they say, Jones says don't trust the mainstream media, but he quotes from it all day.
[01:10:44.546 --> 01:10:45.847]  Well, yeah, of course I do.
[01:10:45.847 --> 01:10:52.390]  I'll take a press release by Homeland Security and a video where they say, hey, we're trying to keep you safe.
[01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:53.910]  Here's a new PSA.
[01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:57.752]  And we take their own information and say, look at what this is really saying.
[01:10:59.912 --> 01:11:01.353]  See, it's called discernment.
[01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:02.933]  It's called analysis.
[01:11:02.933 --> 01:11:04.974]  We analyze what they're doing.
[01:11:04.974 --> 01:11:13.837]  So they outright lie, they spin, they obfuscate, they flip-flop, but they also sometimes tell the truth.
[01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.939]  Especially if it's an issue of little or no significance.
[01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.739]  Let's go ahead and take more calls here.
[01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:21.380]  Let's talk to Evan in Michigan.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.481]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:11:23.854 --> 01:11:31.540]  Hi Alex, I just want to thank you and commend you for what you did versus Rush Limbaugh, that pathetic loser.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:41.588]  You know, I'm a member in the Navy right now and I'm actually taking initiatives since I've heard the last caller, you know, educating his fellow Marines.
[01:11:41.588 --> 01:11:48.334]  I'm going to take the same initiative and educate my fellow Navy members around me.
[01:11:48.334 --> 01:11:52.697]  A lot of them are going to get deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan this year, so sadly.
[01:11:53.738 --> 01:11:57.881]  You know, I'm going to tell them that they're not going to turn against their citizens.
[01:11:57.881 --> 01:12:06.165]  And, you know, it's wonderful, you know, to hear that you are a voice of reason in there for us, for all of us.
[01:12:06.165 --> 01:12:07.786]  Well, by the way, I'm just one person.
[01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:11.769]  I'm just a small focal point in the larger fabric that's humanity.
[01:12:11.769 --> 01:12:17.132]  But the fact that Ron Paul is the main frontrunner shows how far the movement for liberty has come.
[01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:22.335]  The fact that Rick Perry has to talk about the fellow reserves being treasonous, that shows how far we've come.
[01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:35.985]  The fact that in City After City we get top ratings, not just in talk radio, but even in music, or total listening audience, shows that these ideas are popular.
[01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:49.496]  The fact that Ron Paul, last election and now again this election, and we've posted the mainstream articles about this, has gotten more contributions than all other Republicans combined from the military.
[01:12:49.496 --> 01:12:51.958]  He's gotten more than Obama has gotten.
[01:12:52.893 --> 01:13:02.054]  So, that right there is an example that our military is awake, and that's why Homeland Security says the number one terror threat is our military.
[01:13:04.197 --> 01:13:06.518]  Yeah, you know, it's true.
[01:13:06.518 --> 01:13:13.722]  I don't doubt it for a minute, you know, and I'm one of them who's been donating for Ron Paul's campaign since 2007.
[01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.663]  I'm even taking it to a further level.
[01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:19.905]  I'm educating all my members about Ron Paul, and they keep asking me, who's Ron Paul?
[01:13:19.905 --> 01:13:22.526]  I say, Ron Paul is a constitutionalist.
[01:13:22.526 --> 01:13:33.372]  He's been running for presidency a long time, and he's the most consistent American who's been spreading the message of liberty, peace, and proud money.
[01:13:33.612 --> 01:13:36.857]  Well, he's not even the most consistent.
[01:13:36.857 --> 01:13:41.022]  He is the most consistent because he's 100% consistent.
[01:13:41.022 --> 01:13:50.175]  If somebody else was 100% consistent, and I didn't even totally agree with their policies, but overall they were good, I would vote for them.
[01:13:51.116 --> 01:13:53.820]  It's ridiculous how good he is.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:14:04.394]  It's ridiculous how accurate he's been, how informed he is, how dedicated, how stoic, how focused, how incredibly energetic he is.
[01:14:04.394 --> 01:14:05.796]  It is a joke!
[01:14:06.938 --> 01:14:09.539]  It is so archetypal that he's the man of the hour.
[01:14:09.539 --> 01:14:16.745]  Right as America is faced with total global government, total police state, total implosion, we have a chance to elect him.
[01:14:16.745 --> 01:14:19.867]  I mean, again, that's how the universe works.
[01:14:19.867 --> 01:14:22.769]  For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:14:22.769 --> 01:14:24.170]  And this is our chance.
[01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:24.691]  God bless you.
[01:14:24.691 --> 01:14:27.633]  I appreciate your call, Evan.
[01:14:27.633 --> 01:14:29.915]  Now, I'm asking people out there.
[01:14:30.535 --> 01:14:39.825]  I'm asking listeners out there, military, former police, current police, former military, what do you think of the rebranding that the terrorists aren't Al Qaeda anymore?
[01:14:39.825 --> 01:14:47.213]  It's that veteran, it's that gun owner, it's that farmer, it's that Ron Paul supporter, it's that white person.
[01:14:47.213 --> 01:14:50.156]  Whites are the new Al Qaeda and I told you this was coming.
[01:14:50.962 --> 01:14:53.704]  I saw it in the internal memos years ago that were leaked to us.
[01:14:53.704 --> 01:15:01.070]  Now they're going public because they're getting ready to start the provocateur events and the purely staged events.
[01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:10.458]  They're going to find mentally ill ex-prisoner white people that they're going to recruit in and lead to try to get them to blow up a school bus or something or bomb a federal building.
[01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:13.881]  And if they can find idiots, they'll do it that way.
[01:15:13.881 --> 01:15:15.002]  That'll be FBI run.
[01:15:15.002 --> 01:15:15.562]  Always is.
[01:15:16.716 --> 01:15:25.501]  But if they have to, they're gonna call in contractors who just do it on their own, then they'll just drug up somebody, some ex-con or something who's a Ron Paul supporter.
[01:15:25.501 --> 01:15:26.942]  It's coming.
[01:15:26.942 --> 01:15:28.303]  It's coming.
[01:15:28.303 --> 01:15:29.003]  Okay?
[01:15:29.003 --> 01:15:33.926]  I mean, just to keep Rand from becoming Senator, they said he was kidnapping women.
[01:15:33.926 --> 01:15:34.646]  Okay?
[01:15:34.646 --> 01:15:37.008]  And that he wasn't a medical doctor.
[01:15:37.008 --> 01:15:37.988]  Okay?
[01:15:37.988 --> 01:15:38.709]  It was all lies.
[01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:51.985]  They're now announcing they're going to play the race car on Ron Paul, Politico is, with the same bull about the dozens and dozens of newsletters that he lent his name to, pre-popularity of the internet.
[01:15:51.985 --> 01:15:57.649]  And I notice the publications in the last election never quoted him.
[01:15:57.649 --> 01:16:00.772]  They would just say these newsletters are full of racism and homophobia.
[01:16:02.874 --> 01:16:09.860]  And then they would actually went and found the newsletters and it would be stuff like, blacks have become dependent to the welfare state.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:10.801]  This is terrible.
[01:16:10.801 --> 01:16:12.522]  It's destroyed their communities.
[01:16:12.522 --> 01:16:13.843]  How is that racist?
[01:16:13.843 --> 01:16:16.966]  Everybody's becoming dependent.
[01:16:16.966 --> 01:16:20.189]  Or homosexuals are trying to recruit in the schools.
[01:16:22.307 --> 01:16:23.388]  That's homophobic?
[01:16:23.388 --> 01:16:26.649]  I mean, don't recruit sexually, period, in the schools.
[01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:32.533]  And it was other writers too, it wasn't even... I mean, the point is, they're now going to that attack pattern.
[01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:44.359]  But if you notice the Politico article, and I shot a video about this yesterday, headlined, Media Plays Race Card Against Ron Paul, it just says, this publication says Ron Paul did this.
[01:16:44.359 --> 01:16:48.761]  And then you go to that publication, they have no quotes, they have nothing.
[01:16:48.761 --> 01:16:49.622]  They just tell you.
[01:16:50.407 --> 01:16:51.727]  He's not a doctor.
[01:16:51.727 --> 01:16:54.348]  He hurts little kittens.
[01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:55.408]  Oh, they're scared, folks.
[01:16:55.408 --> 01:16:56.328]  They're scared.
[01:16:56.328 --> 01:16:59.309]  Which is all the evidence you need of how good he is.
[01:16:59.309 --> 01:17:01.909]  John in PA, the father of a military son.
[01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:07.110]  He's got his view on the government saying that the military is the number one terror threat in the new Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.730]  Go ahead, John.
[01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:09.731]  This is great.
[01:17:09.731 --> 01:17:15.092]  First off, I wanted to tell you that my son is an IA in Iraq right now.
[01:17:15.092 --> 01:17:17.272]  He runs a phallus gun, and she's found incoming.
[01:17:17.874 --> 01:17:23.396]  But what I wanted to tell you about was a conversation he had with his Chief Petty Officer on the way to the gym.
[01:17:23.396 --> 01:17:27.017]  He overheard two guys talking about the Promise Keepers.
[01:17:27.017 --> 01:17:36.961]  And the next thing you know, there's five or six sailors on that ship, all talking about how they were supportive of the Promise Keepers, or they were a member of the Promise Keepers.
[01:17:36.961 --> 01:17:39.621]  And he didn't even try to solicit it.
[01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:43.023]  He was just on his way to the gym, and he heard these guys, and he started talking to them.
[01:17:44.983 --> 01:17:47.844]  That half of that ship is completely awake.
[01:17:47.844 --> 01:17:51.426]  You know, they want to support the Constitution.
[01:17:51.426 --> 01:17:57.829]  Absolutely, now they're the promise keepers, you know, that promise to be good Christian men, and that's great, and not be worldly, but there's also the oath keepers.
[01:17:57.829 --> 01:18:00.051]  Was it promise keepers or oath keepers?
[01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:02.512]  Oath keepers, Alex, I'm sorry, I got the wrong one.
[01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:03.192]  Oath keepers.
[01:18:03.192 --> 01:18:07.955]  The guys who swear to abide and protect and defend the Constitution, you know.
[01:18:07.955 --> 01:18:10.996]  That's one thing in the Navy, they still have in their oath.
[01:18:10.996 --> 01:18:14.118]  When I went to his, out of boot camp, out in
[01:18:15.436 --> 01:18:25.005]  Above Chicago, up in Great Lakes, all those fine young men all took an oath to defend the Constitution.
[01:18:25.005 --> 01:18:35.875]  And the other thing I wanted to tell you is that all those young men were about three or four hours drive out of Norfolk, so when they had all the classes, they used to drag up five and six guys at a time.
[01:18:36.519 --> 01:18:37.960]  We opened up our house to them.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.722]  All of them had these great, positive attitudes.
[01:18:40.722 --> 01:18:49.829]  Now, uh, my son's awake and I show a lot of the guys that come up here, Endgame and, uh, Freedom of the Fascism, all these movies.
[01:18:49.829 --> 01:18:52.291]  And you know what half of them said?
[01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:53.892]  Let it happen.
[01:18:53.892 --> 01:18:56.073]  We're going to fight and we're going to win.
[01:18:56.073 --> 01:18:59.296]  They can't wait for the globalists to make their move.
[01:18:59.296 --> 01:19:00.096]  They can't wait.
[01:19:00.096 --> 01:19:04.720]  These guys are positive and they're people that, like you said,
[01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:07.220]  They're people that do things.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.900]  They're active.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:14.682]  You know, they didn't sign up to protect our country just to sit around and draw a check.
[01:19:14.682 --> 01:19:19.123]  And that's what some of the globalists, they're dependent on these guys to turn on us.
[01:19:19.123 --> 01:19:22.344]  They're greatly mistaken.
[01:19:22.344 --> 01:19:23.224]  Well, absolutely.
[01:19:23.224 --> 01:19:27.786]  I appreciate your call and say hi to your son and tell him we appreciate his service to the Republic.
[01:19:28.493 --> 01:19:34.076]  You know, if you look at the General Enlisted oath, they do swear to the Constitution and the President.
[01:19:34.076 --> 01:19:38.878]  But if you look at the officers, it's to the Constitution.
[01:19:38.878 --> 01:19:43.100]  And that's why officers are commissioned by Congress.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:48.683]  Because our founders didn't trust the President to be in command of the military.
[01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:49.563]  Purely.
[01:19:49.563 --> 01:19:51.144]  The Congress directs the President.
[01:19:52.085 --> 01:20:00.853]  Who the enemy is, he then prosecutes as the commander-in-chief, but the officers and the separation of power, Congress has commissioned them.
[01:20:00.853 --> 01:20:02.895]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[01:20:02.895 --> 01:20:05.057]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.

[01:21:08.978 --> 01:21:16.463]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1998.
[01:21:16.803 --> 01:21:17.023]  We're good.
[01:21:37.503 --> 01:21:38.023]  I think so.
[01:22:00.425 --> 01:22:05.649]  If you drive for a living, you don't get paid to stop or wait in line.
[01:22:05.649 --> 01:22:08.250]  Keep your wheels moving with PrePass.

[01:22:31.459 --> 01:22:34.841]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:22:34.841 --> 01:22:43.026]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:22:43.026 --> 01:22:48.349]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:22:48.349 --> 01:22:51.331]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:55.233]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:22:55.233 --> 01:22:58.455]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[01:23:00.336 --> 01:23:01.978]  Life Before the Collapse.
[01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:04.101]  Final LP by The Lost Vegas.
[01:23:39.338 --> 01:23:48.366]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[01:23:50.489 --> 01:23:56.453]  I was just watching Fox Business during the break out there on the television and it showed every arrow of every stock in the three-minute break
[01:24:16.357 --> 01:24:24.724]  Aiming straight down red, with the stock market now down over 400 points, except for two, gold and silver.
[01:24:24.724 --> 01:24:30.249]  Gold and silver were aiming up, then it was showing gold and silver stocks, most of those were up as well.
[01:24:30.249 --> 01:24:37.215]  Not because they're really up, but because the dollar is being devalued, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:38.857 --> 01:24:40.719]  And it's that simple.
[01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:47.166]  We've got Max Keiser joining us coming up here in the next segment to break down what's happening in the markets and I've got a bunch of other news we're going to be covering.
[01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:52.873]  But right now, let us take another call to Raul in Florida.
[01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:58.759]  He's a former Marine and he's got, I guess, a comment on the fact that Big Sis is running national TV ads.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:03.263]  In ad after ad, the terrorists are all white.
[01:25:03.263 --> 01:25:07.786]  And the President and the Vice President say it's the Tea Party, they're getting ready to attack us.
[01:25:07.786 --> 01:25:13.509]  Gee, when the Tea Party supposedly attacks folks, is this a little obvious this is a setup?
[01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:15.691]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:25:15.691 --> 01:25:17.912]  Your comment, Raul.
[01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:18.813]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:21.014]  Yeah, I'm an ex-Marine.
[01:25:21.014 --> 01:25:22.535]  A few quick comments.
[01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:24.597]  Anybody that's in the service should watch the
[01:25:25.695 --> 01:25:27.596]  I sent you an email.
[01:25:27.596 --> 01:25:28.096]  I don't know who got it.
[01:25:56.814 --> 01:26:06.663]  Someone or something that told me about 9-11 and the tsunami in Japan, and if this happens, what I saw in that email, well I'll have to contact you in the future then.
[01:26:06.663 --> 01:26:08.025]  Well let me stop you.
[01:26:08.025 --> 01:26:10.647]  What's your InfoWars.com email ticket number again?
[01:26:10.647 --> 01:26:10.687]  266-130.
[01:26:10.687 --> 01:26:12.329]  266-130?
[01:26:12.329 --> 01:26:12.809]  That's right.
[01:26:18.499 --> 01:26:20.440]  Okay, we'll pull that up right now.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:29.464]  What do you think of the rebranding over now to basically saying anybody who doesn't like global government, you're terrorists now?
[01:26:29.464 --> 01:26:40.189]  Well, I think that the closer they get, obviously the people are going to be waking up faster and faster and it drives them to make or take desperate measures, you know.
[01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:43.351]  So things are going to become more irrational.
[01:26:43.351 --> 01:26:45.892]  The things that they say now are going to become more irrational.
[01:26:46.388 --> 01:26:51.306]  And people just need to open up their eyes and see how things change so quickly.
[01:26:51.886 --> 01:26:58.709]  That maybe a year ago, nobody would even mention that on TV, and now they're saying things that just don't make sense, you know?
[01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:59.950]  Well, it's simple, exactly.
[01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:01.170]  They're the terrorists.
[01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:06.313]  They know we're on to them, and they're going to now say we're the terrorists, and they're also going to then pose as us as well.
[01:27:06.313 --> 01:27:17.077]  They're going to hit us from every angle and come out and talk bad about the New World Order and talk bad about the Federal Reserve like Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry are doing right now, but their history shows they've always served it.
[01:27:17.077 --> 01:27:20.139]  They're so desperate because of Ron Paul, they're trying to become him.
[01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:23.920]  I'm going to bring that up to Max Keiser too, not just on the economy.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.561]  I'm going to get his take on the awakening that's happening.
[01:27:26.561 --> 01:27:28.442]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:27:28.442 --> 01:27:33.643]  Let's talk to a retired police officer, Jake, in Chicago.
[01:27:33.643 --> 01:27:38.625]  Then we'll get to Barack, Justin, Joe, and others.
[01:27:38.625 --> 01:27:39.585]  Go ahead, Jake.
[01:27:39.585 --> 01:27:41.626]  You're on the air.
[01:27:41.626 --> 01:27:43.147]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:27:43.147 --> 01:27:44.447]  I appreciate it.
[01:27:44.447 --> 01:27:49.849]  I used to be a police officer with the sheriff's office in Chicago.
[01:27:51.076 --> 01:27:55.519]  And I can tell you, and I left there several years back.
[01:27:55.519 --> 01:28:19.137]  I'm now a doctor of metaphysics, which is a complete different deal, but the interesting thing is when I was doing police work, we handled people in a completely different fashion, and we were always told to be mindful of the way that we dealt with minority people so that it could never be construed
[01:28:19.727 --> 01:28:24.590]  That we were doing anything that would be considered prejudicial.
[01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:30.834]  And to see this swing completely, like, blows my mind.
[01:28:30.834 --> 01:28:33.195]  And I started taking notice.
[01:28:33.195 --> 01:28:42.661]  Wherever I go, I notice that almost every police department in the Chicago suburbs and whatnot, they're dressing like military now.
[01:28:43.444 --> 01:28:59.734]  They don't dress like cops because you used to have to have an inspection of pressed uniform so that you put on a nice image so that when you went out into the public... Yeah, the old-fashioned peace officer, instead they look like Mexican paramilitary police.
[01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:04.717]  Exactly, and when I started seeing that, I'm like, everybody's wearing combat boots.
[01:29:04.717 --> 01:29:06.698]  Nobody wears a tie anymore.
[01:29:06.698 --> 01:29:12.061]  They wear the little, like, dickie-type thing underneath the shirt, like on Hill Street Blues.
[01:29:12.737 --> 01:29:17.843]  And I'm like, this is going military and there's battering rams on the cars.
[01:29:17.843 --> 01:29:20.786]  And I'm like, we never had battering rams on the car.
[01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:23.409]  If we had to kick in a door, we did it the old way.
[01:29:23.409 --> 01:29:25.292]  We kicked in a door.
[01:29:25.292 --> 01:29:29.316]  So it's become a completely different world.
[01:29:29.316 --> 01:29:33.421]  And something that I saw this morning literally scared the hell out of me.
[01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:35.162]  Stay there, I'm going to have you finish up.
[01:29:35.162 --> 01:29:39.966]  We're getting Max Keiser on the line, but I want you to be able to finish up, then he can comment on what you say.
[01:29:39.966 --> 01:29:45.269]  Max Keiser, who's really, with great precision, broken down so much of what's coming in the economy.
[01:29:45.269 --> 01:29:49.793]  He'll be with us coming up to track the implosion in the stock market, the rise of gold.
[01:29:49.793 --> 01:29:51.074]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.074 --> 01:29:54.997]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.997 --> 01:29:57.678]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.444 --> 01:30:04.986]  And you're subject to public police action.
[01:30:04.986 --> 01:30:06.247]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.247 --> 01:30:10.170]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:12.412]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.412 --> 01:30:18.276]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.276 --> 01:30:24.521]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:30.884]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:35.106]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.106 --> 01:30:39.389]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:45.332]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.332 --> 01:30:48.894]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.894 --> 01:30:50.855]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.855 --> 01:30:51.295]  It's here.

[01:32:08.633 --> 01:32:08.973]  I'm good.
[01:32:28.883 --> 01:32:31.545]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:37.329]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:37.329 --> 01:32:38.970]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:40.271]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:40.271 --> 01:32:42.953]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.953 --> 01:32:47.176]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:47.176 --> 01:32:51.799]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:54.400]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.422]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:32:58.243 --> 01:33:06.450]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:33:06.450 --> 01:33:11.995]  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.
[01:33:11.995 --> 01:33:16.159]  By now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[01:33:16.159 --> 01:33:23.206]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.
[01:33:28.647 --> 01:33:41.437]  Okay, we're going to Max Keiser here in a moment, and he's going to be with us into the next hour and a bit.
[01:33:41.437 --> 01:33:45.621]  We will then shift gears into some phone calls for Max with your Economic
[01:33:46.522 --> 01:33:53.788]  Questions after we've finished up with the callers that are currently on the line, military, police, and others.
[01:33:53.788 --> 01:33:55.690]  Are you concerned about the rebranding now?
[01:33:55.690 --> 01:34:02.737]  They're saying, okay, it was Al Qaeda, now it's anybody that doesn't like the Federal Reserve, and the Tea Party's gonna blow you up.
[01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:12.900]  When they talk about Tea Party, they mean the real Ron Paul Tea Party, not the Rick Perry Republican co-opted Tea Party where they say, yeah, let's get the bankers.
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.861]  They're doing that because we're starting to win.
[01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:21.463]  I want to go back to Jake, a retired police officer in Chicago who's concerned about the militarization of police.
[01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:30.174]  We've got a bunch of other current police, former police, military, all with comments as well, and we will get to you.
[01:34:30.174 --> 01:34:34.057]  But first, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors that make this broadcast possible.

[01:35:20.243 --> 01:35:22.144]  Also, Diamond Gusset.
[01:35:22.144 --> 01:35:25.467]  We try to have sponsors that are made in America.
[01:35:25.467 --> 01:35:26.928]  And this is all.
[01:35:26.928 --> 01:35:29.410]  The cotton's grown here, it's sewn here.
[01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:33.513]  Motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, other types of clothing.

[01:36:04.751 --> 01:36:07.053]  Now, finishing up with a caller and then to Max Keiser.
[01:36:09.744 --> 01:36:12.606]  Jake, you were bringing up things that you're really concerned about.
[01:36:12.606 --> 01:36:15.909]  The militarization of police, the goonishness of all of it.
[01:36:15.909 --> 01:36:18.771]  You said you saw something on the news that really concerns you.
[01:36:18.771 --> 01:36:20.473]  Go ahead.
[01:36:20.473 --> 01:36:21.774]  Yeah, I get a call this morning.
[01:36:21.774 --> 01:36:23.976]  Somebody says, Dr. Jake, I sent you a link.
[01:36:23.976 --> 01:36:24.956]  Check it out.
[01:36:24.956 --> 01:36:34.524]  And I go on there and I see this thing where Obama is telling, I believe the guy's name is Assad, telling him to step aside.
[01:36:34.524 --> 01:36:39.248]  And I thought, who in the hell is he to tell somebody else to step aside?
[01:36:40.385 --> 01:36:50.273]  And that just blew my mind that the gall of the way things are going, the way these people are acting towards other world leaders, telling them to get out of the way.
[01:36:50.273 --> 01:36:56.518]  Could you imagine if somebody from China told us, hey, stop doing this or that?
[01:36:56.518 --> 01:37:01.022]  We'd say, mind your own business, forget about it, and we'd go about our lives, right?
[01:37:01.022 --> 01:37:02.804]  Yes.
[01:37:02.804 --> 01:37:08.809]  And I see that the government is rapidly becoming more
[01:37:09.799 --> 01:37:13.743]  militarized in its function.
[01:37:13.743 --> 01:37:20.109]  As opposed to being more administrative, it is becoming more of a military operation.
[01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:34.262]  And like I said earlier, when I see these local police departments with battery lamps, guys in combat boots, think about if a woman called and said, I hear strange noises behind my house, could you please send a car?
[01:37:35.154 --> 01:37:40.019]  They send guys over there that look like military guys that would scare the hell out of children.
[01:37:41.187 --> 01:37:43.449]  It's all part of conditioning the public.
[01:37:43.449 --> 01:37:48.653]  They've had police chiefs admit that the black uniforms, the mask, it's meant to scare the public.
[01:37:48.653 --> 01:37:52.216]  They don't want police and the public being friends anymore.
[01:37:52.216 --> 01:37:57.400]  They want police to be revenue generators and enforcers just like they are in Mexico.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:02.384]  I remember going to Mexico 25 years ago and the cops were dressed there like they're dressed here now.
[01:38:02.384 --> 01:38:03.885]  Same thing in North Korea.
[01:38:03.885 --> 01:38:05.266]  It's all about intimidation.
[01:38:05.266 --> 01:38:06.207]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:16.621]  We are going into a total depression designed by the mega banks to institute a financial dictatorship.
[01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:17.923]  And in the case of Assad...
[01:38:19.494 --> 01:38:32.542]  It is admitted that NATO, the United States, and Israel have been shipping arms across the border to radical Muslim groups, because he's got a secular government, to overthrow them.
[01:38:32.542 --> 01:38:37.985]  Just like they just helped overthrow Mubarak, the old dictator, and are putting in the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:38:37.985 --> 01:38:44.749]  Only so they can have another war with the Shiites and others in a couple of years.
[01:38:44.749 --> 01:38:46.570]  The globalists are that cold-blooded.
[01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:54.016]  And I'm not saying Assad's a good guy, but yes, that's why they put Obama in and gave him a peace prize.
[01:38:54.016 --> 01:38:56.678]  Well, some people say, well, he's the man of peace.
[01:38:56.678 --> 01:38:58.900]  This is not a war in Libya, it is peace.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:05.146]  You know, I was reading, I keep saying four months, the AP was reporting there's been a war in Libya now for six months.
[01:39:06.462 --> 01:39:07.423]  Remember Obama?
[01:39:07.423 --> 01:39:10.726]  War in Libya to last... In fact, guys, pull this up.
[01:39:10.726 --> 01:39:11.207]  Obama.
[01:39:11.207 --> 01:39:12.027]  Headline.
[01:39:12.027 --> 01:39:13.929]  Conflict to last days.
[01:39:13.929 --> 01:39:14.590]  Or Obama.
[01:39:14.590 --> 01:39:17.312]  NATO involvement to last days, not weeks.
[01:39:17.312 --> 01:39:19.194]  That involvement's four and a half months.
[01:39:19.194 --> 01:39:21.456]  Been going on for a couple months before that.
[01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:22.698]  Six months.
[01:39:22.698 --> 01:39:25.180]  They're blowing up their power plants.
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:27.042]  Their water production.
[01:39:27.042 --> 01:39:28.163]  They're laying siege.
[01:39:28.163 --> 01:39:29.985]  They're killing civilians everywhere.
[01:39:31.092 --> 01:39:35.816]  Because he has been building up Africa and trying to create their own banking system.
[01:39:35.816 --> 01:39:38.958]  That is not... The Serbs tried to do that!
[01:39:38.958 --> 01:39:40.179]  Not allowed!
[01:39:40.179 --> 01:39:42.040]  Who do they use to take out the Serbs?
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:42.841]  Al-Qaeda!
[01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:44.062]  Muslim extremists!
[01:39:44.062 --> 01:39:45.483]  Who do they use to attack the Russians?
[01:39:45.483 --> 01:39:46.303]  Al-Qaeda!
[01:39:46.303 --> 01:39:49.546]  Who do they use to attack us, so they can then take our rights away?
[01:39:49.546 --> 01:39:51.327]  Al-Qaeda!
[01:39:51.327 --> 01:39:51.787]  Al-Qaeda!
[01:39:52.782 --> 01:40:00.084]  Joining us is Max Keiser and I really appreciate Max coming on the broadcast with us.
[01:40:00.084 --> 01:40:06.446]  He has TV shows with BBC, RT, Press TV, radio talk show host.
[01:40:06.446 --> 01:40:09.007]  You can go to his website maxkeiser.com and learn more.
[01:40:09.947 --> 01:40:14.754]  And he's an American broadcaster, filmmaker, and former equities broker, worked with George Soros' son.
[01:40:14.754 --> 01:40:16.277]  I'll ask him about that someday.
[01:40:16.277 --> 01:40:22.286]  Kaiser is the host of On The Edge, a program of news and analysis, and again,
[01:40:24.645 --> 01:40:31.631]  Max Keiser invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange virtual trading system, virtual specials technology used on many stock markets today.
[01:40:31.631 --> 01:40:38.136]  He lives in Paris and he joins us now from there via phone.
[01:40:38.136 --> 01:40:40.558]  Max, I want to cover the waterfront with you today.
[01:40:40.558 --> 01:40:48.644]  I thought that was a really informative interview we did last week with an InfoWars nightly news report.
[01:40:48.644 --> 01:40:51.166]  Well, really the precursor to that starting September 1st.
[01:40:51.166 --> 01:40:53.268]  It was a InfoWars special report.
[01:40:54.228 --> 01:41:01.693]  But I want to go over so much of what we see happening in the stock market, gold and silver exploding, where we are.
[01:41:01.693 --> 01:41:20.045]  I mean, I know you've predicted that we would continue to go into a depression, that you predicted that the euro would continue to collapse, that they would call for a super euro, a quote, financial European Union, where now the bankers through France and Germany are going to be given total control over every facet of the nation state.
[01:41:20.045 --> 01:41:21.226]  Same thing happening here.
[01:41:21.226 --> 01:41:23.187]  The global banker occupation
[01:41:23.547 --> 01:41:24.652]  This is accelerating.
[01:41:27.899 --> 01:41:35.004]  And again, I know I have you here talking about basically more of the same, but things are moving so much quicker.
[01:41:35.004 --> 01:41:38.887]  Now we're getting a clear image of exactly what their plan is.
[01:41:38.887 --> 01:41:41.428]  We're seeing newspaper headlines every day in the U.S.
[01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:44.871]  Casinos are the answer, just like NAFTA and GATT were the answer.
[01:41:44.871 --> 01:41:51.975]  The casino gulag economy you talked about, virtual currencies and video game systems.
[01:41:51.975 --> 01:41:54.777]  That's now we're being told our new economy.
[01:41:54.777 --> 01:41:57.379]  I mean, this is literally something like
[01:41:58.099 --> 01:42:01.542]  Out of a nightmare science fiction movie, Max.
[01:42:01.542 --> 01:42:03.424]  Yeah, agreed, agreed.
[01:42:03.424 --> 01:42:15.013]  I think the interesting thing to look at today would be the French banks, okay, as the continuation of the story that you just told.
[01:42:15.013 --> 01:42:21.138]  Today the French banks are collapsing, and in particular, Societe Generale.
[01:42:21.138 --> 01:42:23.741]  And Societe Generale is
[01:42:24.441 --> 01:42:29.747]  Basically the bank that got the huge bailout during the 2008 period.
[01:42:29.747 --> 01:42:36.174]  It is also where all of the derivatives that were on the books of AIG were moved.
[01:42:36.843 --> 01:42:56.891]  So when AIG was bailed out, and vis-a-vis these French banks were bailed out, the bulk of the $600 trillion in derivatives, and this is a number that the Bank of International Settlements just confirmed this week, there are over $600 trillion in derivatives floating around in the banking system.
[01:42:56.891 --> 01:42:59.032]  And derivatives is just a fancy word for debt.
[01:42:59.875 --> 01:43:10.026]  Most of that debt now sits on the books of Societe Generale in France, and that bank had a market cap of $150, $160 billion.
[01:43:10.026 --> 01:43:19.616]  It's now down to $16 billion, and the rumor here in France is that they're going to go bankrupt and that they will need another massive state bailout, and this will
[01:43:19.796 --> 01:43:29.804]  Well, let me stop you, Max, because we don't have the crew to go pull all this up, but you've predicted this, Bob Chapman, Webster Tarpley, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:43:29.804 --> 01:43:34.728]  I mean, years ago, you guys said there's going to, after the first round of bailouts in the U.S.
[01:43:34.728 --> 01:43:36.769]  and Europe, there's going to be more and more bailouts.
[01:43:36.769 --> 01:43:38.391]  These aren't really bailouts.
[01:43:38.391 --> 01:43:42.134]  This is a debt derivatives black hole that we don't owe, that we can't pay back.
[01:43:42.694 --> 01:43:56.837]  After each raping of the population and each new austerity move, they will just simply move from Ireland to Greece, to Spain, to Italy, to Portugal, later to France, England, and then Germany last.
[01:43:56.837 --> 01:44:00.898]  But instead, I mean, you've been absolutely right, it's hopping directly to France.
[01:44:00.898 --> 01:44:07.900]  So we've known that they were always going to, quote, bankrupt them, but am I correct in saying that it's accelerating?
[01:44:09.355 --> 01:44:16.991]  It is accelerating because the hope was that at some point that the economy would grow and that there would be enough growth to
[01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.909]  Yeah.
[01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:51.370]  It's becoming impossible now.
[01:44:51.370 --> 01:45:11.176]  For 25 years, it was easy to hide the debt because it was in the context of a 25-year bull market in bonds, which means that interest rates for 25 years since Reagan took office were going down, and so every time new debt was due to be paid, you could simply roll it over and add
[01:45:12.216 --> 01:45:17.680]  to the debt pile without actually paying it off because interest rates kept going lower.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.602]  So this was, in effect, kicking the can down the road.
[01:45:21.602 --> 01:45:30.448]  But now, you've got a situation where you've got global debt saturation, where it's impossible to hide the dirty laundry.
[01:45:30.448 --> 01:45:40.735]  And so now these banks are blowing up, and they're pulling out all of these unbelievably irregular, illegal banking and regulatory tricks
[01:45:41.562 --> 01:45:50.682]  To hide that, if you go back to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, if you do a Google search for Repo 105, for example, Lehman Brothers was caught.
[01:45:51.317 --> 01:45:58.159]  Listen, I want to go over that, Max, but here's the $64 million, or I should say $64 trillion question.
[01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:22.542]  That we've been talking about, we cover an Obama deception, fall of the republic that you appear in, and again, predict all of this in, now out for almost two years.
[01:46:24.807 --> 01:46:28.968]  They've created 1.5 quadrillion conservatively in fake derivatives.
[01:46:28.968 --> 01:46:33.189]  They've gotten our pension funds, our stock markets tied up in them.
[01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:43.052]  And then the very criminals that engineered this Ponzi fraud are up there saying they're too big to fail and our entire world economy has to be fed into them.
[01:46:43.052 --> 01:46:45.953]  And the more we give them, the worse things get.
[01:46:45.953 --> 01:46:49.214]  And so how do we bring the criminals to justice?
[01:46:49.214 --> 01:46:50.254]  I mean, is there a point?
[01:46:51.074 --> 01:46:55.177]  That it's coming to, or is their police state they've put in going to protect them?
[01:46:55.177 --> 01:47:03.323]  And if we can't bring them to justice through some avenue, and I want to hear your ideas on that, then where are they going to lead us?
[01:47:03.323 --> 01:47:16.953]  Well, what the politicians are doing to try to avert this catastrophe, and we just heard it from Ben Bernanke, he wants to keep interest rates at zero for another two years or indefinitely.
[01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:26.139]  And so that's a catastrophe because it's a 0% interest rate that created the securitization and the Ponzi scheme to begin with.
[01:47:26.139 --> 01:47:31.224]  To get to your point from the earlier segment, this is what Ron Paul has been pointing out for years.
[01:47:31.224 --> 01:47:41.754]  Suddenly people understand this and now you've got a Rick Perry jumping on that bandwagon trying to capitalize on what Ron Paul has put 10 years into educating the public about.
[01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:58.176]  But those 0% interest rates are the root cause of the problem because that's how you create and securitize this debt in ways where you can move it from one balance sheet on a bank in New York to a French bank and never have it go away.
[01:47:58.176 --> 01:48:07.599]  And so, remember that the biggest single player in the global derivatives market with $90 trillion stated on their book of derivatives
[01:48:10.772 --> 01:48:15.215]  Well, that was my next issue.
[01:48:15.215 --> 01:48:20.698]  It's the mega-banks that are completely zombie and have hundreds of times the debt that governments have.
[01:48:20.698 --> 01:48:21.718]  We're talking about the U.S.
[01:48:21.718 --> 01:48:25.680]  being insolvent over $14.5 trillion.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:32.804]  And then, meanwhile, we're talking about hundreds of trillions inside of these individual banks, and they're lecturing us, Max.
[01:48:32.804 --> 01:48:33.545]  It's insane!
[01:48:34.713 --> 01:48:34.973]  Right.
[01:48:34.973 --> 01:48:35.494]  J.P.
[01:48:35.494 --> 01:49:02.391]  Morgan is effectively an appendage of the Federal Reserve Bank, and they put all of these debts, these global debts, they wash them through their balance sheet and then put them on the books of the Fed, and then the Fed puts them on the books of the BIS in Switzerland, and then the BIS ends up putting them on the books of countries like Greece and France and these other countries, and then the government ends up saying, we need to impose austerity measures to pay for this debt.
[01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:09.176]  But the fact is that people who are suffering the austerity measures were never responsible for incurring these debts.
[01:49:09.176 --> 01:49:15.502]  Now they're beginning to figure it out, and that's why they're rising, because they're being asked to pay debts that they had nothing to do to incur.
[01:49:15.502 --> 01:49:17.864]  And they didn't get the fees when the debts were created.
[01:49:17.864 --> 01:49:23.789]  They're not collecting all of the bonus money and the salary bonuses to make those debts to begin with.
[01:49:23.789 --> 01:49:24.930]  They're just getting screwed.
[01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:30.814]  And the wealth and income gap, you know, that the spread between the top and the bottom has never been wider.
[01:49:30.814 --> 01:49:35.397]  Not even during the Robert Barron period did you see such an extreme wealth and income gap.
[01:49:35.397 --> 01:49:48.245]  And that's what's driving a lot of the unrest, is that the top one-tenth of one percent controls an enormous percentage of the overall wealth, so that people are responding as you would predictably expect they would respond.
[01:49:48.245 --> 01:49:49.686]  They are revolting!
[01:49:49.686 --> 01:49:52.168]  Now you ask me, what can be done about it?
[01:49:53.101 --> 01:49:57.205]  Obviously, the policy makers are in the pockets of the banks.
[01:49:57.205 --> 01:50:04.292]  Then you've got a guy like Ron Paul, who, for several years, was not even talked about on mainstream media.
[01:50:04.292 --> 01:50:15.022]  Now his message is so painfully obvious that you've got folks like Jon Stewart, who has a wildly popular daily show, come out and point out the inconsistency.
[01:50:15.022 --> 01:50:16.443]  This guy's being ignored.
[01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:16.764]  Why?
[01:50:17.544 --> 01:50:21.648]  And so now it's bubbling over, and now you've got, the gloves have come off.
[01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:29.094]  Now Rick Perry has raised the bar, is calling Ben Bernanke a tyrant, and things are hopping off, jumping off.
[01:50:29.094 --> 01:50:30.155]  Things are getting heated.
[01:50:30.155 --> 01:50:38.523]  Yeah, the system's so scared they're now trying to co-opt it with a guy they know is totally bought and paid for, totally plastic like Rick Perry.
[01:50:38.523 --> 01:50:40.665]  He's now, why it's treacherous!
[01:50:40.665 --> 01:50:41.906]  They're treason!
[01:50:42.506 --> 01:50:43.628]  But it's all talk.
[01:50:43.628 --> 01:50:52.439]  That's how scared they are of Ron Paul, which again, Ron Paul is a manifestation of the fact that his popularity signifies that people are really starting to wake up.
[01:50:52.439 --> 01:50:59.449]  So I want to talk to you, Max, about what's going to happen if we don't beat these bankers and how you think we can beat them.

[01:52:02.122 --> 01:52:06.806]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:06.806 --> 01:52:13.271]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:13.271 --> 01:52:15.533]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:15.533 --> 01:52:17.935]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:17.935 --> 01:52:21.658]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:22.785 --> 01:52:25.868]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:25.868 --> 01:52:29.711]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:52:29.711 --> 01:52:34.755]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:52:34.755 --> 01:52:38.178]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:38.758 --> 01:52:42.162]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:42.162 --> 01:52:46.667]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:46.667 --> 01:52:51.592]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:52:51.592 --> 01:52:56.218]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:56.218 --> 01:52:58.400]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:53:00.424 --> 01:53:01.765]  What happened, man?
[01:53:01.765 --> 01:53:05.869]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[01:53:05.869 --> 01:53:09.412]  Now, you fall asleep on the couch, irritable, and out of shape.
[01:53:09.412 --> 01:53:10.813]  Don't be that guy!

[01:53:52.210 --> 01:53:52.550]  Again, 1-800-847-6170.
[01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:56.732]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, and the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry.
[01:54:14.858 --> 01:54:20.805]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[01:54:22.415 --> 01:54:30.819]  Alright, I know we got loaded phones with police officers and others, and I can take your calls I guess here for Max Keiser.
[01:54:30.819 --> 01:54:33.240]  I hate to hang up on people that we moved on to other topics.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:40.403]  So we'll just get to you coming up the next hour, and as you hear callers hang up, you've got a quick question or comment on the economy for Max Keiser.
[01:54:40.403 --> 01:54:40.563]  It's 800-259-9231.
[01:54:40.563 --> 01:54:40.623]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:40.623 --> 01:54:42.463]  I'm Alex Jones, of course, with InfoWars.com.
[01:54:42.463 --> 01:54:42.663]  So Max,
[01:54:51.803 --> 01:54:52.984]  We're here.
[01:54:52.984 --> 01:54:57.368]  We've broken it down historically, what the banking cartel's done.
[01:54:57.368 --> 01:55:00.270]  They bought the world through fraudulent derivatives.
[01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:07.897]  Now they're telling us that they're our masters because they bought off our politicians and they signed us onto their debts.
[01:55:07.897 --> 01:55:09.898]  I mean, it's completely asinine.
[01:55:09.898 --> 01:55:14.602]  Their only hope is to somehow sell us on that we're guilty and we owe it.
[01:55:14.602 --> 01:55:16.224]  And so now I'm seeing the talking point.
[01:55:18.192 --> 01:55:24.542]  Floated that anybody who's against the Federal Reserve, anybody that wants to audit the Fed, anybody who supports Ron Paul...
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:27.481]  They're the new terror threat.
[01:55:27.481 --> 01:55:29.843]  And Biden is saying they're going to hit us.
[01:55:29.843 --> 01:55:34.926]  So it's pretty clear they're getting ready for a false flag to be blamed on the people.
[01:55:34.926 --> 01:55:36.928]  Maybe an attack against the Federal Reserve or something.
[01:55:36.928 --> 01:55:43.052]  And then the stock market drops 2,000 points and they say, oh, Billy Bob Johnson of the Tea Party did it.
[01:55:43.052 --> 01:55:45.053]  He's the reason we had a depression.
[01:55:45.053 --> 01:55:47.615]  I mean, they're looking for something like that.
[01:55:47.615 --> 01:55:54.280]  While at the other angle that you mentioned, they've got Rick Perry coming in trying to co-opt and saying, why, absolutely.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.183]  Ron Paul says get rid of the Fed, I say arrest them!
[01:55:58.183 --> 01:56:05.048]  Of course, that's all talk, but this shows how far the awakening process, the education process has gone.
[01:56:05.048 --> 01:56:11.573]  I mean, is this not an incredibly positive sign that people are actually talking about the real problem now?
[01:56:11.573 --> 01:56:12.694]  The banker occupation?
[01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:27.854]  Yeah, and on the global level, it's resonating on the central bank level, and it's resonating in Venezuela, because they now want 99 tons of gold that's stored for them in London, delivered to them, the physical stuff.
[01:56:27.854 --> 01:56:34.977]  And here's the great thing about that, is that the Bank of England really outsources that to J.P.
[01:56:34.977 --> 01:56:35.837]  Morgan, and J.P.
[01:56:35.837 --> 01:56:37.257]  Morgan doesn't have it.
[01:56:37.257 --> 01:56:39.598]  So they have to go into the open market to buy it.
[01:56:40.228 --> 01:56:48.490]  So Venezuela is doing Visa Gold, what we were hoping to do with JPMorgan by buying silver.
[01:56:48.490 --> 01:56:49.871]  But they're doing it with gold.
[01:56:49.871 --> 01:56:52.231]  They're saying, we want all of our gold.
[01:56:52.231 --> 01:56:58.613]  The fact is that big banks like JPMorgan have sold gold that they don't have, and they have to go into the open market.
[01:56:59.233 --> 01:56:59.973]  We're good to go.
[01:57:23.218 --> 01:57:37.824]  Well, that's the drum you've been beating for several years, that they're all in there naked shorting silver and gold, and if you take physical possession, that will short-circuit them.
[01:57:37.824 --> 01:57:44.927]  Do you think Chavez is grabbing their gold because he knows that there could be a military move against him, and a confiscation of it, like Gaddafi?
[01:57:44.927 --> 01:57:46.688]  Or is he doing it to call their bluff?
[01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:52.926]  He wants the gold because he realizes that the paper money era is finished.
[01:57:52.926 --> 01:57:57.130]  And he's also nationalizing all the gold mines in Venezuela.
[01:57:57.130 --> 01:57:59.171]  And he wants the physical stuff delivered.
[01:57:59.171 --> 01:58:00.873]  And this is what's happening around the world.
[01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:04.777]  Central banks, for the first time in 30 years, are buying gold.
[01:58:04.777 --> 01:58:13.685]  It's remarkable that back in the 2000-2001 period, Gordon Brown, who was the exchequer of the exchange in London at the time,
[01:58:14.085 --> 01:58:17.087]  He actually sold half of Britain's gold.
[01:58:17.087 --> 01:58:23.191]  He sold 300 tons in the open market at what amounted to $240 an ounce.
[01:58:23.191 --> 01:58:27.853]  The historic low for the post-war period.
[01:58:27.853 --> 01:58:31.956]  And he just basically got rid of half of Britain's gold.
[01:58:31.956 --> 01:58:34.698]  That's the lowest price imaginable.
[01:58:34.698 --> 01:58:36.959]  And now he looks like a complete idiot.
[01:58:36.959 --> 01:58:37.699]  Max, stay there.
[01:58:37.699 --> 01:58:38.500]  Back in one minute.

[01:59:05.543 --> 01:59:07.943]  History really does repeat itself.

[01:59:12.782 --> 01:59:15.884]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:59:15.884 --> 01:59:19.727]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:59:19.727 --> 01:59:28.773]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.

[01:59:56.234 --> 01:59:58.997]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.595 --> 02:00:10.420]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.021]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.021 --> 02:00:13.563]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.563 --> 02:00:17.747]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.747 --> 02:00:21.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.968 --> 02:00:41.692]  All right, Max Keiser with us another 20 minutes.
[02:00:41.692 --> 02:00:50.663]  Then we've got Dr. Bob Bowman joining us to get into a lot of the areas he's allowed to talk about dealing with secret space program with that big...
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:57.304]  Hypersonic aircraft that they launched into orbit last week, a new space plane.
[02:00:57.304 --> 02:00:59.186]  Want to be breaking that down.
[02:00:59.186 --> 02:01:01.928]  Max, I want to get into the big enchilada here though.
[02:01:01.928 --> 02:01:06.371]  So you've accurately diagrammed what's happened so far.
[02:01:06.371 --> 02:01:09.994]  And we're talking about France and Germany going into a big crisis.
[02:01:09.994 --> 02:01:11.135]  This is the final move.
[02:01:12.403 --> 02:01:26.927]  To hold those countries hostage to the private banking cartel and set up a private financial EU union, which is the genesis of the Bank of the World that you talked about that the bankers will sell as the solution.
[02:01:26.927 --> 02:01:29.128]  You talked about that on one of our Infowars.com
[02:01:32.319 --> 02:01:36.421]  Well, I mean, am I allowed to use the phrase forthright?
[02:01:57.961 --> 02:02:15.336]  Because last year, in November of 2010, I did a special report on RT and I outlined that the collapse of the European banking system was setting up a situation where you would seek a European bond market or a coordination of all the European banks
[02:02:16.156 --> 02:02:18.797]  And that it would all be run out of Berlin.
[02:02:18.797 --> 02:02:20.118]  And this is a fourth Reich.
[02:02:20.118 --> 02:02:27.520]  And now, the mail article you just quoted, the headline of that article is, Welcome to the Fourth Reich.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.402]  Because this is what's happening now.
[02:02:30.402 --> 02:02:36.404]  It was the success after three times its failure by Germany to control all of Europe.
[02:02:36.937 --> 02:02:53.096]  Because the entire system is going to be... When Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale go bankrupt this week or next week, the solution will be to bring in Eurobonds to roll that debt up.
[02:02:53.576 --> 02:02:57.038]  As I've been saying now for years, to a new Euro bond.
[02:02:57.038 --> 02:03:09.885]  It plays into the New World Order kind of thinking, but it's the step before you have the New World Order, you'll have the European, New European Order, which will be run out of Berlin.
[02:03:09.885 --> 02:03:18.050]  And so all that debt will be rolled up into a new Euro bond, and that'll be restructured and re-securitized, and the banks will make another huge round of huge fees.
[02:03:18.738 --> 02:03:43.806]  And then it'll be turned into 30, 40, 50-year debt, and the interest rate will be low, of course, and the ECB and the Deutsche and the Bundesbank, the old German central bank, this will be the new European-wide central bank, and they will effectively have this European-wide government that was not elected, that they put together themselves, that'll be running Europe, and you've got one step removed then,
[02:03:44.486 --> 02:03:50.268]  From the same thing happening in North America and Asia as we head toward the New World Order, as you put it.
[02:03:50.268 --> 02:03:54.610]  But this is the penultimate step toward New World Order.
[02:03:54.610 --> 02:04:07.415]  It happened this week with France and Germany agreeing or talking about having a dual governance system and combining their economies in a way that's completely outside of any election or referendum by any of the underlying citizens.
[02:04:07.765 --> 02:04:08.205]  And again, by
[02:04:26.838 --> 02:04:31.420]  The Financial Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek are all pushing as a solution.
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:34.321]  Hey, you know those big secretive bankers that did all this?
[02:04:34.321 --> 02:04:35.561]  They've got a solution!
[02:04:35.561 --> 02:04:37.422]  They're gonna rule everything now!
[02:04:37.422 --> 02:04:38.862]  Doesn't that sound great?
[02:04:38.862 --> 02:04:45.065]  We're gonna come back and continue with where this will lead on the other side with Max Keiser.
[02:04:45.065 --> 02:04:47.706]  And then we're going to take some of your phone calls on the other side.
[02:04:47.706 --> 02:04:49.666]  But yes, there's the Daily Mail headline.
[02:04:49.666 --> 02:04:51.067]  Welcome to the Fourth Reich.
[02:04:51.747 --> 02:04:53.650]  And it's all out of crises.
[02:04:53.650 --> 02:04:58.999]  Rise of the Fourth Reich, how Germany is using the financial crisis to conquer Europe.
[02:04:58.999 --> 02:04:59.539]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.170 --> 02:05:06.194]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.194 --> 02:05:09.438]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.438 --> 02:05:14.243]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:14.243 --> 02:05:20.630]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.630 --> 02:05:22.872]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.413 --> 02:05:23.713]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.713 --> 02:05:24.214]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.214 --> 02:05:25.014]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:25.014 --> 02:05:26.175]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.175 --> 02:05:28.416]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.304 --> 02:05:49.587]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:06:02.642 --> 02:06:06.603]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:06.603 --> 02:06:15.465]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:15.465 --> 02:06:20.086]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:20.086 --> 02:06:30.908]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:31.528 --> 02:06:41.051]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:41.051 --> 02:06:46.473]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:46.473 --> 02:06:53.976]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:53.976 --> 02:06:56.717]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:07:00.698 --> 02:07:01.879]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:01.879 --> 02:07:08.802]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:08.802 --> 02:07:11.363]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.363 --> 02:07:16.746]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.746 --> 02:07:19.787]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:19.787 --> 02:07:21.848]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:22.108 --> 02:07:28.351]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.351 --> 02:07:31.732]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.732 --> 02:07:37.515]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:37.515 --> 02:07:39.156]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:39.156 --> 02:07:40.456]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:40.456 --> 02:07:43.117]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:43.117 --> 02:07:44.538]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:07:44.798 --> 02:07:47.340]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:51.964]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:51.964 --> 02:07:54.546]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:08:01.472 --> 02:08:04.254]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.254 --> 02:08:07.057]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:25.951 --> 02:08:31.173]  All right, if you just joined us, Max Keiser and I were breaking down the heart of the matter.
[02:08:31.173 --> 02:08:32.874]  Then we're going to your phone calls.
[02:08:32.874 --> 02:08:34.015]  There's the Daily Mail.
[02:08:34.015 --> 02:08:40.638]  I saw just scores of other newspapers in Europe and the United States with the same headline.
[02:08:40.638 --> 02:08:42.538]  Rise of the Fourth Reich.
[02:08:42.538 --> 02:08:45.780]  How Germany is using the financial crisis to conquer Europe.
[02:08:46.641 --> 02:08:53.727]  But more than that, Germany's the biggest contributor to the, quote, bailouts, which are really consolidations.
[02:08:53.727 --> 02:09:03.634]  And there's been many founders of the EU that have bragged, we've quoted them in our films, saying the euro was set up by the banking cartels to bring countries into receivership.
[02:09:03.634 --> 02:09:09.799]  So to say that Germany itself is leading this new Reich, I don't really agree with that, or France either.
[02:09:09.799 --> 02:09:10.840]  The big mega banks
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:11.840]  I think?
[02:09:32.313 --> 02:09:34.135]  Literally run the countries.
[02:09:34.135 --> 02:09:36.416]  That's what they're saying now in Greece and other areas.
[02:09:36.416 --> 02:09:39.058]  Their countries, their people don't run anything.
[02:09:39.058 --> 02:09:40.900]  Their parliaments run nothing.
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.321]  Like a third world country.
[02:09:43.092 --> 02:09:45.393]  That signed on to the IMF or World Bank.
[02:09:45.393 --> 02:09:49.135]  But again, most of this debt is not owed by the people.
[02:09:49.135 --> 02:09:51.516]  Depending on the estimates I've seen, on average it's above 90%.
[02:09:51.516 --> 02:09:57.298]  It's actually derivatives that are fraudulent.
[02:09:57.298 --> 02:09:59.859]  What is the path here, Max Keiser?
[02:09:59.859 --> 02:10:06.082]  A, where will the establishment, the global banking occupation as you dub it, what is their goal?
[02:10:06.082 --> 02:10:10.624]  What are they going to try to do versus what should we do to counter them?
[02:10:12.247 --> 02:10:28.949]  Well, just to follow up on what we were saying in terms of this new euro bond, global euro, universal euro bank, another part of the urgency to this is what's happening in the Swiss franc, because the Swiss franc is running away in value against the dollar and the euro, it's up 40-50%.
[02:10:30.832 --> 02:10:31.673]  Speak up for me, Max!
[02:10:52.668 --> 02:10:53.669]  Yeah.
[02:10:53.669 --> 02:11:05.783]  You'll see a peg from the Swiss franc to this new... There's an urgency to it because the Swiss franc is running completely out of control on the upside and it's hurting the Swiss economy.
[02:11:05.783 --> 02:11:06.724]  Well, that was my next point.
[02:11:06.724 --> 02:11:12.291]  They tried to devalue it, as you know, yesterday, and that made investors only rush in more and greedily buy it.
[02:11:12.893 --> 02:11:19.577]  Yeah, they also outlawed short-selling of bank stocks in Europe, and that did not stop the collapse today.
[02:11:19.577 --> 02:11:21.519]  That's very, very telling.
[02:11:21.519 --> 02:11:37.069]  It shows that the speculative frenzy to go after these banks and their inherent weakness is enormous, and that's why now the talk is that a French bank will go bankrupt, and it will require now a huge global response.
[02:11:37.793 --> 02:11:53.916]  Now, Max, this sounds like a snake eating itself, because a lot of these big megabanks, I mean, this is the core of the globalist system, and yes, they're using the crisis to get even more power, but their own structure is being destroyed in the process.
[02:11:53.916 --> 02:11:56.317]  Have they bitten off more than they can chew?
[02:11:56.317 --> 02:11:59.697]  Were they irrationally exuberant themselves?
[02:11:59.697 --> 02:12:02.858]  Did they become delusional?
[02:12:02.858 --> 02:12:05.299]  Did they get delusions of grandeur?
[02:12:05.299 --> 02:12:06.799]  Could this be the end of these people?
[02:12:07.602 --> 02:12:09.084]  Well, they're killing off the competition.
[02:12:09.084 --> 02:12:17.413]  So, for example, on Wall Street now, you got rid of Bear Stearns, you got rid of Lehman Brothers, you got rid of all the competition.
[02:12:17.413 --> 02:12:24.160]  So when they set up these big deals, like when they take Facebook public or Groupon public, which incidentally has been exposed as a massive Ponzi scheme,
[02:12:24.867 --> 02:12:26.788]  Only one or two banks get that deal.
[02:12:26.788 --> 02:12:30.391]  Only one or two banks are trading on the inside stock transactions.
[02:12:30.391 --> 02:12:35.534]  So this is all about consolidation toward just having a few global players.
[02:12:35.534 --> 02:12:37.335]  And they're getting rid of the competition.
[02:12:37.335 --> 02:12:39.317]  This is extremely anti-competitive.
[02:12:39.317 --> 02:12:41.378]  That's the worst element of this at all.
[02:12:41.378 --> 02:12:45.281]  And that's the point that a leader like in the U.S.
[02:12:45.281 --> 02:12:47.342]  should be making first and foremost.
[02:12:47.342 --> 02:12:49.263]  Essentially, this is anti-competitive.
[02:12:49.263 --> 02:12:54.667]  The bailouts create too big to fail, which is the very definition of anti-competition.
[02:12:55.007 --> 02:12:56.368]  So that's their goal.
[02:13:25.027 --> 02:13:32.370]  And he did stuff, here they break down, that's mild compared to what JPMorgan Goldman Sachs is doing.
[02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:37.052]  I mean, that's what Madoff was right when he said, look, the whole stock market's a Ponzi scheme.
[02:13:37.052 --> 02:13:45.215]  I mean, at the end of the day, this Kurt Barton here in Austin and Bernie Madoff are only trying to do what the big boys are doing.
[02:13:46.775 --> 02:13:47.935]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:47.935 --> 02:13:53.978]  And they are trying to get down to the two or three, only the biggest players.
[02:13:53.978 --> 02:13:55.698]  But you'd expect them to do that.
[02:13:55.698 --> 02:13:59.160]  That's what you expect happens in an economy.
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.341]  But that's why you need regulation.
[02:14:01.341 --> 02:14:06.022]  Because even Adam Smith talked about this in Wealth of Nations in 1776.
[02:14:06.022 --> 02:14:07.803]  That book was published.
[02:14:07.803 --> 02:14:12.365]  And he said, you know, the animal spirits, or the competitive spirits,
[02:14:13.165 --> 02:14:22.773]  I need to be constantly and vigilantly monitored because as he put it, if you put two businessmen in a bar, they will collude.
[02:14:22.773 --> 02:14:24.154]  That's their nature.
[02:14:24.853 --> 02:14:27.675]  So you must be vigilant on the regulatory side.
[02:14:27.675 --> 02:14:35.579]  And this is something that for 20 years, all the regulations have been deregulated, and it was sold to us as a way to grow the economy.
[02:14:35.579 --> 02:14:40.182]  It did, for a while, grow the real estate market, and so people looked the other way.
[02:14:40.182 --> 02:14:51.128]  Until the real estate market collapsed, and people were left worse off than when they started, and now we're back to the fundamental question of, well, shouldn't these bankers be regulated?
[02:14:51.128 --> 02:14:52.449]  That's the fundamental question.
[02:14:52.589 --> 02:14:56.851]  Yeah, they haven't even brought back Glass-Steagall that we got after the Depression, so here's the issue.
[02:14:56.851 --> 02:14:59.152]  They're not bringing the regulation back in.
[02:14:59.152 --> 02:15:05.695]  The public is waking up, though, and so it's two freight trains in collision course.
[02:15:05.695 --> 02:15:18.201]  If they continue these policies for another two years, as they've announced, giving themselves free money while blocking and the Federal Reserve paying banks not to lend to Main Street, what is going to happen?
[02:15:19.278 --> 02:15:27.846]  Well, at this point, there is only really one solution, and that would go under the category of debt jubilee.
[02:15:27.846 --> 02:15:32.050]  These debts must simultaneously be scrubbed off the books.
[02:15:32.050 --> 02:15:35.513]  The bondholders must be paid the piper.
[02:15:35.513 --> 02:15:37.715]  They're going to take the massive losses.
[02:15:37.715 --> 02:15:39.137]  That's what Ron Paul says we've got to do.
[02:15:39.977 --> 02:15:41.899]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:15:41.899 --> 02:15:44.921]  And Jim Rickert, who's an excellent guy.
[02:15:44.921 --> 02:15:46.423]  You see him on TV often.
[02:15:46.423 --> 02:15:48.605]  I've interviewed him several times.
[02:15:48.605 --> 02:15:50.526]  He'll break it down for you as well.
[02:15:50.526 --> 02:15:54.750]  He's an excellent guest to consider for your show, Jim Rickert.
[02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:57.833]  He is of the same belief as well.
[02:15:57.833 --> 02:15:59.194]  And if you go throughout history,
[02:15:59.854 --> 02:16:00.975]  It's right there in the Bible.
[02:16:00.975 --> 02:16:08.479]  You know, the Bible itself talked about having a jubilee every period of time to purge the system of all the bad debts.
[02:16:08.479 --> 02:16:09.700]  Yeah, every 10 years.
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:15.384]  And again, these idiots that say, you've got to prop it up, we've got to fix the system.
[02:16:16.384 --> 02:16:17.125]  What's the magnitude?
[02:16:17.125 --> 02:16:20.287]  Because some say it's 100 times, some say 200 times.
[02:16:20.287 --> 02:16:23.429]  The derivatives magnitude versus real assets.
[02:16:23.429 --> 02:16:26.211]  I mean, there's no paying off a black hole.
[02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:29.473]  The more solar systems you feed into it, the bigger it gets.
[02:16:30.083 --> 02:16:38.486]  Well, the global GDP of the world is about $50 trillion, and the global derivative market is $600 trillion.
[02:16:38.486 --> 02:16:40.827]  So that's your ratio right there.
[02:16:40.827 --> 02:16:48.910]  Over 10 to 1 of faulty derivatives to GDP of the world.
[02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:50.991]  So you disagree with the analysis that it's $1.5 quadrillion?
[02:16:53.547 --> 02:16:56.610]  Well, there's two numbers here.
[02:16:56.610 --> 02:17:03.415]  One is the market size, which is the actual buying and selling of derivatives, which is $1.5 quadrillion.
[02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:08.239]  Then there's the underlying value of the underlying securities themselves, which is approximately $600 trillion.
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:20.444]  Then some people will say, well these are completely matched, therefore the liability is not that great, but that assumes that a counterparty like JPMorgan is solvent.
[02:17:20.444 --> 02:17:27.066]  And that's where people like myself and others point out that, wait a minute, you can't really assume that JPMorgan is solvent because
[02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:31.608]  They have 90 trillion of these bad debts on their books, and they're not solvent.
[02:17:31.608 --> 02:17:35.950]  Therefore, you must use that value of 600 trillion as the liability.
[02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:39.111]  You can't assume that these are going to be offset in some way.
[02:17:39.111 --> 02:17:45.074]  And the trading of these derivatives is over a quadrillion, and that's where the bankers make their fees.
[02:17:45.074 --> 02:17:47.014]  They trade these every single day.
[02:17:47.014 --> 02:17:50.636]  You know that there's over $4 trillion worth of forex.
[02:17:51.156 --> 02:17:55.679]  And they're all in there getting fees on selling zombie garbage back and forth.
[02:18:10.987 --> 02:18:24.294]  They're buying and selling America every week for a fee, and the guy, the little businessman out there who's trying to scrape by selling widgets for a 50% markup is trying to compete to make his $20,000, $30,000, $50,000 a year.
[02:18:24.294 --> 02:18:30.458]  He's competing with the bankers that are in the $1.5 trillion market where they're spending his entire country.
[02:18:30.638 --> 02:18:39.384]  And now the bankers are saying, raise the taxes to pay us more bailout money on the little guy in the street.
[02:18:39.384 --> 02:18:40.265]  It is just incredible.
[02:18:40.265 --> 02:18:47.390]  You know, I meant to get to Stan and Joe and Mark, and I really want to get to them, but we're just out of time.
[02:18:47.390 --> 02:18:52.074]  I apologize to the callers, because I've got Dr. Bob Bowman coming up.
[02:18:52.734 --> 02:18:53.655]  I mean, we're in a race here, Max.
[02:18:53.655 --> 02:18:56.940]  We either educate the public, and the public takes some interest in this,
[02:19:10.518 --> 02:19:14.642]  And really get angry and say no to these people, or we have no future.
[02:19:14.642 --> 02:19:23.630]  But I think at the end of the day, the good news is people are starting to get angry if establishment hacks to get elected, like Rick Perry or having to talk like Ron Paul.
[02:19:23.630 --> 02:19:27.514]  I mean, in the final equation, is that not a positive indicator, Max?
[02:19:29.770 --> 02:19:39.912]  Well, Ron Paul gets it, and clearly he would be the guy who you would want to sort through this mess.
[02:19:39.912 --> 02:19:53.174]  But as we know in American political history, it seems that every time you get somebody who knows what they're talking about, even close to getting into office, you know, there's a lot of problems suddenly that come from left field.
[02:19:53.174 --> 02:19:57.615]  You know, Rick Perry, you know... Hold on, hold on, finish up, finish up, stay there.
[02:20:02.512 --> 02:20:04.354]  Hey Bill, pick up line 3, it's Brian.
[02:20:04.354 --> 02:20:05.535]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[02:20:05.535 --> 02:20:06.015]  Brian here.
[02:20:06.015 --> 02:20:06.776]  Thanks.
[02:20:06.776 --> 02:20:12.200]  Hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the Safety Net, our full-year emergency food system.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:20.087]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore, especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply.
[02:20:20.267 --> 02:20:30.334]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings, but the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal.
[02:20:30.334 --> 02:20:33.216]  It's truly great tasting food at amazing prices.
[02:20:33.216 --> 02:20:35.738]  The variety is also a huge bonus bill.

[02:24:25.006 --> 02:24:26.329]  I could talk to Max all day.
[02:24:26.329 --> 02:24:27.931]  I could talk to callers all day.
[02:24:27.931 --> 02:24:30.616]  I could talk to our guests forever.
[02:24:30.616 --> 02:24:31.939]  I love doing this radio show.
[02:24:31.939 --> 02:24:34.784]  You know, it's painful to know this stuff's happening.
[02:24:34.784 --> 02:24:36.427]  But it's even more painful to not.
[02:24:37.501 --> 02:24:39.602]  Have an avenue to confront these people.
[02:24:39.602 --> 02:24:43.864]  I can't imagine what it's like for people that are awake, but who aren't out warning others.
[02:24:43.864 --> 02:24:50.648]  And I can't imagine what it's like for the general public that's still not aware of what's happening when they finally get hit by this.
[02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:55.351]  Max, you were making an interesting point about the New World Order during the break, and then on Rick Perry.
[02:24:55.351 --> 02:24:55.871]  Please finish.
[02:24:57.632 --> 02:24:58.433]  Right.
[02:24:58.433 --> 02:25:07.784]  As we were saying, the penultimate step towards this new world order, we're seeing it in Europe, the trans-European bond market that's going to report only to itself, okay?
[02:25:07.784 --> 02:25:15.813]  This plays into the Alex Jones New World Order thesis, and you know, going back five years,
[02:25:16.607 --> 02:25:21.989]  That was, it seemed like it was an idea that was not on the radar.
[02:25:21.989 --> 02:25:26.270]  And, you know, we talked about the debt jubilee concept, which is taken from the Bible.
[02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:31.032]  You know, to use another Bible story, it's like that Noah and the Ark story.
[02:25:31.032 --> 02:25:35.314]  You know, when Noah started to build the Ark, everyone thought he was crazy.
[02:25:35.314 --> 02:25:44.177]  Now, what we now know is that the Ark you've been building has been to protect us from the rising tide of debt.
[02:25:45.303 --> 02:25:49.266]  40 days and 40 nights of bank closures of a bank holiday.
[02:25:49.266 --> 02:25:50.687]  That's what's coming.
[02:25:50.687 --> 02:25:54.210]  40 days and 40 nights of a global bank holiday.
[02:25:54.210 --> 02:26:03.917]  And then the other end of this will be the New World Order, which will mean all the global currencies will be reset, like Brenton Woods Part 2.
[02:26:03.917 --> 02:26:07.940]  The dollar is going to take a 50-60% haircut down.
[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:14.285]  Gold will be a lot higher, so will silver, and various other currencies will plug into the system a different way.
[02:26:14.966 --> 02:26:18.269]  But that's now no longer off the radar.
[02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:19.630]  That's on the radar.
[02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:21.291]  Now it's happening.
[02:26:21.291 --> 02:26:25.455]  And it comes down to faith.
[02:26:25.455 --> 02:26:27.256]  The Bible is full of allegories, Alex.
[02:26:27.256 --> 02:26:28.738]  I don't take the Bible literally.
[02:26:28.738 --> 02:26:38.466]  I see it as allegories that can be used... Don't let Rick Perry steal the Bible and use it to promote his evilness.
[02:26:38.466 --> 02:26:42.569]  Allegories can be used by anybody to promote anything.
[02:26:42.569 --> 02:26:43.130]  In this case,
[02:26:43.729 --> 02:26:44.609]  Goodness!
[02:26:44.609 --> 02:26:51.652]  The Noah and the Ark story is a fantastic story as an allegory, as an analogy of what the problem is.
[02:26:51.652 --> 02:26:55.573]  There's a 40-day, 40-night bank holiday coming.
[02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:59.515]  We're building the Ark out of gold and silver, and you have to have faith.
[02:27:01.104 --> 02:27:02.546]  Absolutely.
[02:27:02.546 --> 02:27:16.600]  Well, you know, I do believe in God and intervening in the affairs of humankind if we ask God for guidance and also take action, but we are definitely in a very, very dangerous time right now.
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:18.662]  Max Keiser, MaxKeiser.com.
[02:27:18.662 --> 02:27:20.543]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:27:20.543 --> 02:27:20.784]  Anytime.
[02:27:21.721 --> 02:27:30.705]  Alright folks, we got Dr. Bob Bowman coming up because I want to get into secret militarized space program a bit.
[02:27:30.705 --> 02:27:34.446]  He doesn't really like to talk about it or get into it, but we'll see what we can squeeze out of him.
[02:27:34.446 --> 02:27:37.708]  Coming up via video connection, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[02:27:37.708 --> 02:27:41.049]  If not, you'll hear him here on the syndicated radio broadcast.
[02:27:41.049 --> 02:27:45.391]  I'm always mentioning, hey, show him this document, show him this video clip, and I forget.
[02:27:45.391 --> 02:27:46.892]  For radio listeners, they're going, huh?
[02:27:47.432 --> 02:27:50.976]  Yeah, it's all simulcast and archived at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:50.976 --> 02:27:57.862]  But I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up to give us an update on where gold and silver is right now, along with the rest of the stock market.
[02:27:57.862 --> 02:27:58.403]  Ted Anderson.
[02:27:59.076 --> 02:28:09.362]  Yeah, yeah, gold right now is 1827.80p, currently right now 1823.4076, and silver current high today of 4102.
[02:28:09.362 --> 02:28:13.124]  Stock market presently right now, Dow Jones Industrial Average down 409.87.
[02:28:13.124 --> 02:28:19.648]  You know, Consumer Price Index came out here up more than two times as much as the
[02:28:21.009 --> 02:28:27.532]  As the economists were predicting, and that's obviously adding more fuel to the fire, and that's what's driving the gold prices up.
[02:28:27.532 --> 02:28:34.935]  Alex, I just need to say it, man, people should be moving 83 bucks, two silver dollars, get the American Dream video, Mark Dice's book.
[02:28:34.935 --> 02:28:40.757]  I mean, at least that gets you started understanding about what's going on, or just absolutely listen to this show every day.
[02:28:40.757 --> 02:28:49.981]  It's the free book, big, thick, great book, Exposing the Orwellian Nightmare Come True, the DVD film, Exposing the Banksters, very well produced, great to show newbies.
[02:28:50.521 --> 02:28:52.542]  Free shipping and the two silver dollars.
[02:28:52.542 --> 02:28:54.043]  Eighty-eight dollars, right, Deb?
[02:28:54.043 --> 02:28:55.303]  Yeah, eighty-eight dollars.
[02:28:55.303 --> 02:28:56.724]  That's the total delivered.
[02:28:56.724 --> 02:28:58.104]  And, you know, you just can't beat it.
[02:28:58.104 --> 02:29:02.046]  I mean, right now, especially with silver hitting that forty-one dollar mark, I mean, come on.
[02:29:02.046 --> 02:29:06.868]  You're not going to buy two silver dollars alone for that price, much less get the book and the video.
[02:29:06.868 --> 02:29:09.890]  And you need to spread the word now more than anything.
[02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:14.672]  Like Kaiser is saying, man, we're talking about bank holidays right now, the biggest problem.
[02:29:14.672 --> 02:29:17.333]  What Bloomberg is reporting on is that the banks are having trouble.
[02:29:18.233 --> 02:29:18.513]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:18.513 --> 02:29:23.436]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:23.436 --> 02:29:32.200]  But again, the private shareholders of the six big megabanks have to fully terrorize the public into acquiescing to their new private bank of the world.
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:35.242]  And for those that don't know, they're now saying a private bank will rule Europe.
[02:29:36.502 --> 02:29:39.664]  Owned by the very banks that have engaged in the financial terrorism.
[02:29:39.664 --> 02:29:40.885]  It is incredible.
[02:29:40.885 --> 02:29:46.388]  And you see Chavez, you see the University of Texas, you see all the big institutions grabbing gold.
[02:29:46.388 --> 02:29:49.250]  Now is the time to move 800-686-2237.
[02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:51.391]  Stay there, Ted.
[02:29:51.391 --> 02:29:52.792]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.792 --> 02:29:55.313]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.313 --> 02:29:57.995]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.334 --> 02:30:04.677]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:04.677 --> 02:30:09.281]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[02:30:09.281 --> 02:30:17.988]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[02:30:17.988 --> 02:30:25.795]  For a limited time, you get 30% off a one-year Freedom Supply, which provides three hearty meals per day for one adult.
[02:30:25.795 --> 02:30:28.157]  The Freedom Supply includes a large variety
[02:30:28.257 --> 02:30:28.477]  I think so.
[02:30:52.093 --> 02:30:52.774]  We're good.
[02:31:00.782 --> 02:31:05.325]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.325 --> 02:31:06.245]  Number one.
[02:31:06.245 --> 02:31:09.667]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.667 --> 02:31:10.527]  Number two.
[02:31:10.527 --> 02:31:15.410]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:16.171]  It's true.
[02:31:16.171 --> 02:31:21.033]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.033 --> 02:31:21.854]  Number three.
[02:31:21.854 --> 02:31:25.456]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.456 --> 02:31:29.138]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.338 --> 02:31:32.899]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.899 --> 02:31:36.580]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.580 --> 02:31:41.521]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.521 --> 02:31:46.563]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.563 --> 02:31:50.744]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.744 --> 02:31:52.525]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.525 --> 02:31:57.126]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:31:57.646 --> 02:31:58.387]  877-327-0365.
[02:31:58.387 --> 02:32:03.370]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.370 --> 02:32:08.693]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:08.693 --> 02:32:10.214]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.214 --> 02:32:19.000]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:27.287]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.287 --> 02:32:35.295]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.295 --> 02:32:40.519]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:40.519 --> 02:32:42.681]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:45.444 --> 02:32:48.666]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:32:48.666 --> 02:32:51.027]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:51.027 --> 02:32:53.149]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:33:12.609 --> 02:33:16.094]  Well, there's a public space program and then there's the real space program.
[02:33:16.094 --> 02:33:20.140]  Over 80% of it is secret, run by the Pentagon and DARPA.
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:28.472]  And Dr. Bob Bowman won't tell us much because it's classified, but he can tell us what has leaked out and what has come out over the years that he's allowed to talk about.
[02:33:28.973 --> 02:33:37.637]  I remember pressing him once in a hotel ballroom where we were giving speeches to 1,200 people at the 9-11 event I put on that C-SPAN carried.
[02:33:37.637 --> 02:33:47.621]  And he said, well, I can tell you a few things they've accidentally declassified and allowed to leak out with their big mouths.
[02:33:47.621 --> 02:33:53.323]  And he described these, you know, robotic space planes with the D-U Sabos.
[02:33:53.723 --> 02:33:58.625]  And I went and looked up what he told me about and sure enough it had leaked over the years.
[02:33:58.625 --> 02:34:01.506]  So we know about Aurora and all these supposed programs.
[02:34:01.506 --> 02:34:10.749]  So we'll see how much he'll tell us here today without violating his national security agreements with Dr. and of course Colonel Bob Bowman, Vietnam veteran and more.
[02:34:10.749 --> 02:34:13.770]  But finishing up with Ted Anderson.
[02:34:15.090 --> 02:34:21.114]  Ted, look, I mean, for our listeners, it's like, OK, yeah, we heard about this 10 years ago.
[02:34:21.114 --> 02:34:22.875]  We heard about it five years ago.
[02:34:22.875 --> 02:34:28.959]  I'm always tooting Bob, people like Bob Bowman's horn for being right about politics.
[02:34:28.959 --> 02:34:34.522]  And I'm always, you know, tooting Max Keiser's or Gerald Salente.
[02:34:34.522 --> 02:34:39.746]  But the truth is, I mean, I've been talking about this stuff 16 years and having economists on like George Humphrey.
[02:34:39.746 --> 02:34:42.608]  I heard him 12 years ago break down exactly what would happen with derivatives.
[02:34:43.667 --> 02:34:45.788]  And we just heard Max Keiser breaking down.
[02:34:45.788 --> 02:34:53.772]  I'm like Noah telling folks about the new world order coming and now it's here and it is a private bank to rule the world run by the Ponzi scheme operators.
[02:34:53.772 --> 02:34:58.234]  I mean, you know, at the end of the day, the super Ponzi scheme operators don't go to jail.
[02:34:58.234 --> 02:35:02.376]  They become world emperors, world financial oligarch rulers.
[02:35:02.376 --> 02:35:03.696]  So pretty incredible stuff.
[02:35:03.696 --> 02:35:10.740]  And we've been telling people buy gold and silver because they're devaluing every major currency except for the Swiss franc, which is shooting up like a rocket right now.
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:13.761]  And so it's time to get into gold and silver.
[02:35:13.761 --> 02:35:19.342]  Now, again, you were telling me off air earlier, most of the gold and silver you've got is stuff you got three weeks ago.
[02:35:19.342 --> 02:35:21.983]  You buy ahead in the market, you've got it on hand.
[02:35:21.983 --> 02:35:25.124]  Three weeks ago, gold was, I don't know, a hundred bucks less than it is now.
[02:35:25.124 --> 02:35:27.124]  Silver, two or three bucks less than it is now.
[02:35:27.124 --> 02:35:29.565]  You're still able to pass those savings on.
[02:35:29.565 --> 02:35:33.946]  It's like people getting in a time machine and going back in time.
[02:35:33.946 --> 02:35:39.107]  And JP Morgan, the top of the pyramid, they say it's going to be $2,500 by the end of the year.
[02:35:39.107 --> 02:35:40.348]  I don't know if that's the case.
[02:35:40.348 --> 02:35:40.888]  I hope not.
[02:35:41.288 --> 02:35:45.833]  Because that signifies they're accelerating the demise of the dollar even quicker.
[02:35:45.833 --> 02:35:48.816]  And the general yuppies out there that only care about SportsCenter and...
[02:35:50.014 --> 02:35:51.836]  The Red Zone and the rest of it.
[02:35:51.836 --> 02:35:53.998]  They have really got some heartache coming.
[02:35:53.998 --> 02:35:58.381]  We tried to stop it, but at least our listeners are somewhat more prepared.
[02:35:58.381 --> 02:36:09.511]  I just hope people will call and get the great deals on gold and silver and the 2-5% that you end up making on these deals also supports the radio network.
[02:36:09.511 --> 02:36:10.072]  And again, that's 2-5%.
[02:36:11.874 --> 02:36:16.778]  Before the stuff went up, so he couldn't sell it to you if he bought it today at these prices.
[02:36:16.778 --> 02:36:21.461]  So briefly, Ted, list some of the other gold and silver offers you've got that are radio specials.
[02:36:21.823 --> 02:36:23.404]  Yeah, radio specials right now.
[02:36:23.404 --> 02:36:26.265]  The Frank I haven't raised in price yet.
[02:36:26.265 --> 02:36:28.086]  It's at $3.9685.
[02:36:28.086 --> 02:36:33.669]  The British Sovereign, quarter ounce gold coin, $4.97.
[02:36:33.669 --> 02:36:37.931]  Walking Liberty Halves right now, $19.53, is a great buy.
[02:36:37.931 --> 02:36:39.072]  Even the older 20s.
[02:36:39.072 --> 02:36:43.074]  Alex, I recommended them at $1,900, then $2,000.
[02:36:43.074 --> 02:36:44.995]  Now they're sitting at $22.82.
[02:36:44.995 --> 02:36:45.995]  They don't make those anymore.
[02:36:45.995 --> 02:36:47.276]  There's a finite supply.
[02:36:47.276 --> 02:36:49.537]  You know, the demand is pushing those now.
[02:36:50.217 --> 02:36:52.761]  And collectors are non-confiscatable, correct?
[02:36:52.761 --> 02:36:53.582]  Right, exactly.
[02:36:53.582 --> 02:36:55.946]  And this stuff is the stuff that's next to milk.
[02:36:55.946 --> 02:37:01.114]  So you're basically getting a great collector coin at near a bullion price.
[02:37:01.556 --> 02:37:02.236]  Right.
[02:37:02.236 --> 02:37:02.597]  U.S.
[02:37:02.597 --> 02:37:04.798]  Eagles, obviously, are a good buy, too, right now.
[02:37:04.798 --> 02:37:07.619]  They're at $1,951.94.
[02:37:07.619 --> 02:37:11.161]  Bags of silver, the dimes, I call them survival bags of dimes.
[02:37:11.161 --> 02:37:16.344]  I used to sell them in $1,000 face increments, but now we've dropped it down to $1,000 dimes, which is $100 face, and currently, right now, it's $3,035.
[02:37:23.328 --> 02:37:27.010]  Those are real silver dimes showing the devaluation there.
[02:37:27.010 --> 02:37:37.636]  Ted, you've also, I know, always have a smattering of other things like Krugerrands, Maple Leafs, my favorite, I think it's the prettiest coin out there that's being minted, the Buffalos, you got any of those?
[02:37:37.636 --> 02:37:41.158]  Yeah, we actually do have those available and people should be buying them right now.
[02:37:41.158 --> 02:37:41.899]  Hold your horses then.
[02:37:43.447 --> 02:37:45.307]  I want one of those, so just hold me one, okay?
[02:37:45.307 --> 02:37:46.248]  Yeah, we'll get one.
[02:37:46.248 --> 02:37:46.848]  Okay, thank you, Ted.
[02:37:46.848 --> 02:37:50.709]  I buy a coin or two here every few months if I can.
[02:37:50.709 --> 02:37:53.089]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:53.089 --> 02:37:57.250]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:57.250 --> 02:38:00.391]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to get involved.
[02:38:00.391 --> 02:38:06.412]  I tried to tell you 250 bucks and 300 bucks and 500 and 1,000, and people said, oh, it's a bubble then.
[02:38:06.412 --> 02:38:11.613]  The bubble is the global government destroying the currencies and destroying our future.
[02:38:12.193 --> 02:38:15.346]  And this is not going to save us getting gold and silver, but it is a good life, bud.
[02:38:16.252 --> 02:38:17.933]  In my educated opinion.
[02:38:17.933 --> 02:38:20.954]  And this is what I believe in, and I think we've been born out to be correct.
[02:38:20.954 --> 02:38:23.595]  The minute I think it's a bubble, I'll tell you to get out of it.
[02:38:23.595 --> 02:38:26.096]  The way they keep devaluing, gold could go to $100,000 an ounce.
[02:38:26.096 --> 02:38:30.138]  I mean, if they go the Zimbabwean or Weimar route, I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:38:30.138 --> 02:38:34.720]  But it's not that gold's a bubble, it's that they're killing the global currencies.
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:35.080]  800-686-2237.
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:35.161]  1-800-686-237.
[02:38:35.161 --> 02:38:36.381]  Ted, thank you so much for those reports.
[02:38:36.381 --> 02:38:36.801]  Yeah, you bet, Alex.
[02:38:43.416 --> 02:38:45.297]  All right, now going to Bob Bowman.
[02:38:45.297 --> 02:38:49.180]  He is the former director of the Advanced Space Program Development for the U.S.
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:56.685]  Air Force in the Ford and Carter administrations when it was secret, and a former United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 combat missions.
[02:38:56.685 --> 02:39:01.769]  He holds a PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering from the California Institute of Technology.
[02:39:01.769 --> 02:39:08.574]  Despite his involvement with the space programs and defense, he emerged as a early public critic of the Strategic Defense Initiative when they weaponized it.
[02:39:09.214 --> 02:39:14.596]  The Patriots.us is his excellent website and I want to cover several issues with him.
[02:39:14.596 --> 02:39:18.016]  But first off, sir, when I saw this last week, DARPA loses contact with hypersonic aircraft
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:37.529]  They claim they lost contact with the last one that goes 13,000 miles an hour, we're told, as if that's the real speed.
[02:39:37.529 --> 02:39:40.573]  Pentagon agency tests hypersonic craft.
[02:39:40.573 --> 02:39:43.036]  They call it the global strike.
[02:39:43.036 --> 02:39:46.040]  And from other folks I've talked to who've worked in the Air Force,
[02:39:47.121 --> 02:39:52.205]  One of them was then hired out of the Air Force to work on the front line of the Apollo program, Raymond Teague.
[02:39:52.205 --> 02:39:56.687]  He told me a lot of stuff privately and then wouldn't say it once he got on air, but he did say some of it.
[02:39:56.687 --> 02:39:59.109]  He thought he was having heart trouble and thought he was about to die.
[02:39:59.109 --> 02:40:02.951]  He's still alive, thank God, and told me a lot of stuff, but I'm not even going to get into that.
[02:40:02.951 --> 02:40:05.753]  The point is, he said, yes, most of the space program is secret.
[02:40:05.753 --> 02:40:07.374]  What you see is not all that's out there.
[02:40:09.115 --> 02:40:17.082]  Under, you know, I actually kind of got a little annoyed when I kept asking you for hours, you know, in the green room at the ballroom to tell me more.
[02:40:17.082 --> 02:40:23.287]  You said, OK, I'll tell you some stuff that's leaked out that they said that should be classified.
[02:40:23.287 --> 02:40:30.373]  But you talked about robotic drones, de-use sabotage, decapitation weapons for heads of state.
[02:40:30.373 --> 02:40:31.754]  And now I'm seeing more and more of this.
[02:40:31.754 --> 02:40:32.555]  So my question is,
[02:40:33.595 --> 02:40:45.121]  You know, they're telling us this is the latest, but from my information, they're just showing us, you know, older stuff, kind of like the B-2 bomber was around for 20 years before they rolled that out in the late 80s.
[02:40:45.121 --> 02:41:00.409]  And so, what's your take on the quote, end of the shuttle program that we know Wernher von Braun thought up in the 30s, and the fact that they admit that more than 80% of the space program is under DARPA and the Pentagon?
[02:41:00.409 --> 02:41:00.889]  Well, sure.
[02:41:05.584 --> 02:41:21.997]  When I was on active duty, I was the executive agent for all of DARPA's activities in space, which means I made the final decisions on the contractors and the money and all that stuff and approved their reports.
[02:41:21.997 --> 02:41:30.404]  And they were doing a lot of interesting things at that time, which of course were secret, like laser battle stations and whatnot.
[02:41:30.404 --> 02:41:32.485]  And we
[02:41:34.809 --> 02:41:48.310]  Also developed components for other black programs like those directly under the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force spy satellites and all the rest of that.
[02:41:49.326 --> 02:41:58.251]  So, yeah, there was a lot of stuff going on, and I was deeply into hypersonic aerodynamics.
[02:41:58.251 --> 02:42:11.898]  My PhD thesis at Caltech was studying shock waves and boundary layers and interactions and whatnot at hypersonic speeds at extremely high altitudes.
[02:42:15.039 --> 02:42:18.983]  So, I mean, this stuff has been under study for a long time.
[02:42:18.983 --> 02:42:31.438]  I did post-doctoral work at the von Karman Institute in Belgium in numerical methods for solving complex aerodynamic problems like hypersonic flight, turbulence, which is even worse.
[02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:44.207]  But it's interesting to me that they still don't know enough about the aerodynamics to be able to control these things.
[02:42:44.207 --> 02:42:52.416]  They're able to launch it and nine seconds later it goes unstable and they lose it into the Pacific.
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:54.221]  Well, uh...
[02:43:12.501 --> 02:43:17.003]  I don't think they can hide something like that in orbit.
[02:43:17.003 --> 02:43:30.469]  And I gotta say, it's much easier to put something like that into orbit than it is to fly it 13,000 miles an hour through the atmosphere and bring it down.
[02:43:33.323 --> 02:43:36.464]  Well, let me go back before we get into this.
[02:43:36.464 --> 02:43:51.589]  You talked about debating the new head of Star Wars and others, and that they would get mad and start blurting classified things out, and that's the only reason you can talk about it, but can you give us stuff that is supposed to be classified but is now public domain?
[02:43:51.589 --> 02:43:59.091]  I mean, give us as best you can without violating your national security agreements of the type of stuff they've got.
[02:44:01.917 --> 02:44:11.850]  Well, they can put a lot of stuff into orbit.
[02:44:11.850 --> 02:44:18.458]  The thing is there's so much space capability around the world now that they can't hide it.
[02:44:19.737 --> 02:44:31.584]  Uh, you know, we've got school teachers in England and whatnot that watch every launch of the United States and... Well, now the Japanese have found big, big, what looks like platforms in space and things.
[02:44:31.584 --> 02:44:35.886]  I mean, there is a lot of unknown stuff up there.
[02:44:35.886 --> 02:44:43.010]  Well, there's stuff up there that, uh, nobody knows exactly what it is, uh, but, uh,
[02:44:43.982 --> 02:44:54.749]  Uh, they do know, uh, its orbit, its altitude, uh, and where it is over the Earth at just about any time.
[02:44:54.749 --> 02:44:58.931]  Well, just tell us about the DU weapons.
[02:44:58.931 --> 02:45:02.974]  Well, that's something that, uh, uh...
[02:45:04.477 --> 02:45:29.106]  was under development a long time ago, and when I was debating one of the colonels in the Star Wars program, I was talking about the fact that we had shown way back in the 70s that a few pounds of metal properly shaped, fired at the Earth from space, could impact like a meteorite, dig a crater, and at least in theory be capable
[02:45:29.726 --> 02:45:35.988]  of destroying hardened military targets like command bunkers and missile silos totally without warning.
[02:45:35.988 --> 02:45:50.633]  Now, this colonel in his rebuttal to me said, now Bob, you know perfectly well that that program to make
[02:45:54.161 --> 02:45:58.343]  Titanium and depleted uranium cones and guide them with GPS.
[02:45:58.343 --> 02:46:02.406]  That program doesn't exist!
[02:46:02.406 --> 02:46:11.871]  And so, anyway, he had revealed technical details which I had never done.
[02:46:11.871 --> 02:46:21.697]  The fact of the matter is that it's possible to do a lot of this stuff, whether it's
[02:46:23.154 --> 02:46:26.517]  Practical is another thing.
[02:46:26.517 --> 02:46:40.592]  Whether we have any such things in space ready to de-orbit against a pinpoint target somewhere on the Earth, I really can't say at this point.
[02:46:40.592 --> 02:46:41.933]  I rather doubt it.
[02:46:41.933 --> 02:46:43.235]  But
[02:46:45.546 --> 02:46:50.549]  That we could have, because the technical capability, at least, is there.
[02:46:50.549 --> 02:47:12.902]  Well, you know, you just put a satellite with propulsion into space, launch it in one of the secret shuttle launches, or in one of the other rocket launches, and then it's got a weapons array of the DU weapons, because I believe what you told me was you were saying it was being looked at in unmanned systems
[02:47:13.522 --> 02:47:17.646]  For head of state decapitation.
[02:47:17.646 --> 02:47:19.388]  Oh yeah.
[02:47:19.388 --> 02:47:19.768]  Oh yeah.
[02:47:22.782 --> 02:47:32.031]  Remember, once those things are in orbit, to get them down out of orbit, you have to have propulsion to de-orbit them.
[02:47:32.031 --> 02:47:34.754]  So they have to have some kind of propulsion.
[02:47:34.754 --> 02:47:38.617]  It's not just a dumb piece of metal.
[02:47:38.617 --> 02:47:44.843]  And then you have your sensors, you have your GPS guidance.
[02:47:45.868 --> 02:47:59.809]  But you also need to have some kind of capability to steer it either with little thrusters or with
[02:48:01.531 --> 02:48:06.352]  Little aerodynamic devices at the tail end of the cone.
[02:48:06.352 --> 02:48:08.353]  And that's one of the things that's hard to do.
[02:48:08.353 --> 02:48:10.634]  Oh, I see.
[02:48:10.634 --> 02:48:14.375]  They're always trying to get steering, like with this new little space plane.
[02:48:14.375 --> 02:48:17.956]  And that's why they're doing it in the atmosphere and not in orbit where it's easier.
[02:48:17.956 --> 02:48:22.077]  Because once the weapon comes into the atmosphere, that's when it starts going crazy.
[02:48:22.077 --> 02:48:25.198]  They can get the speed, they just can't get the accuracy.
[02:48:25.198 --> 02:48:25.878]  Right, right.
[02:48:27.073 --> 02:48:32.754]  Now, getting the accuracy is not impossible.
[02:48:32.754 --> 02:48:51.819]  Either we studied terminally guided ICBMs, and if you can do that, you can do it with these rods from God, or whatever they call them now.
[02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:55.831]  These kind of projects.
[02:48:55.831 --> 02:48:59.834]  You're talking about controlling an ICBM throughout the entire process.
[02:48:59.834 --> 02:49:04.157]  As it launches, goes into orbit, comes back down and goes through the MIRV sequence.
[02:49:04.157 --> 02:49:14.065]  Now, Doctor, expanding... I'm talking about accurately pinpoint guiding and controlling the individual warheads.
[02:49:14.065 --> 02:49:14.245]  Yes.
[02:49:16.528 --> 02:49:22.551]  Expanding on that, we're about to go to break, and I want to come back and talk about Fukushima.
[02:49:22.551 --> 02:49:23.832]  Well, let's just get to Fukushima now.
[02:49:23.832 --> 02:49:34.838]  You were absolutely accurate in that, and now it turns out they knew there were all these meltdowns, they covered it up, and now the EPA has just raised the level of radiation of what they say is safe.
[02:49:34.838 --> 02:49:42.883]  That is not very reassuring for future disasters that they just always cover this stuff up.
[02:49:45.438 --> 02:49:59.559]  That's right and still in this country we're not talking about replacing the antiquated reactors that are similar to Fukushima and which
[02:50:01.201 --> 02:50:16.908]  Are on fault lines, you know, like along the San Andreas Fault in California and there are even fault lines through the Midwest and also up near New York City with the Indian Point reactor.
[02:50:17.988 --> 02:50:30.938]  All these reactors are disasters waiting to happen, and if we can't get rid of them, we should replace them with a modern thorium reactor or a molten salt reactor.
[02:50:30.938 --> 02:50:42.087]  There are lots of new kinds of reactors that are far, far safer, orders of magnitude safer than the old kinds that we have deployed around the country.
[02:50:42.287 --> 02:50:49.791]  Alright, Dr. Bob Bowman, I want to come back and get any other final comments on the secret space program from you and then also your view on what's happening in the economy.
[02:50:49.791 --> 02:50:54.193]  Bob Bowman is our guest and we'll give you his website as well when we come back.
[02:50:54.193 --> 02:50:57.574]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:51:02.387 --> 02:51:08.092]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[02:51:08.092 --> 02:51:12.275]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[02:51:12.275 --> 02:51:18.020]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:23.645]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[02:51:23.985 --> 02:51:30.548]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[02:51:30.548 --> 02:51:38.251]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[02:51:38.251 --> 02:51:47.075]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[02:51:47.495 --> 02:51:53.864]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[02:51:53.864 --> 02:51:57.048]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[02:51:57.048 --> 02:51:59.010]  That's survivalrx.com.
[02:52:00.968 --> 02:52:02.410]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.410 --> 02:52:13.063]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:13.063 --> 02:52:17.169]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:52:17.529 --> 02:52:20.270]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:52:20.270 --> 02:52:31.536]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:52:31.536 --> 02:52:35.037]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:52:35.037 --> 02:52:38.899]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the four
[02:52:38.899 --> 02:52:39.179]  I'm good.
[02:53:00.942 --> 02:53:07.373]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:53:07.373 --> 02:53:08.795]  I lost 20 pounds.
[02:53:08.795 --> 02:53:10.498]  I lost 40 pounds.
[02:53:10.498 --> 02:53:12.762]  I lost 55 pounds.
[02:53:12.762 --> 02:53:14.164]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[02:53:15.655 --> 02:53:22.540]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:26.182]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:53:26.182 --> 02:53:30.265]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[02:53:30.265 --> 02:53:36.790]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:45.375]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:52.420]  1-800-737-9107.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:26.283]  The stock market's down 453 points.
[02:54:26.283 --> 02:54:33.050]  We'll continue to watch this throughout the day and post the latest information at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:33.050 --> 02:54:42.180]  The official radio show is over in about five minutes and I'll do my little five-minute overdrive that's PrisonPlanet.tv and the audio streams only.
[02:54:43.101 --> 02:54:47.367]  And of course Lord Willem will be back tomorrow live 11 a.m.
[02:54:47.367 --> 02:54:49.049]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:49.049 --> 02:54:49.970]  Central Time.
[02:54:49.970 --> 02:55:00.024]  ThePatriots.us, Dr. Bob Bowman's great website and again he's a nuclear physicist as well as a degreed
[02:55:03.604 --> 02:55:07.727]  I really couldn't get a better expert on to talk about what's happening.
[02:55:07.727 --> 02:55:10.089]  You know, Dr. Bowman, you have children, grandchildren.
[02:55:10.089 --> 02:55:13.171]  I think I met your grandson once you had her with you.
[02:55:13.171 --> 02:55:15.432]  Yeah, I've got 21 grandchildren.
[02:55:15.432 --> 02:55:16.093]  21 grandchildren.
[02:55:18.663 --> 02:55:26.470]  Well, you know, I've got three children, and I love them all a thousand times my own life, and I don't get the ruling class.
[02:55:26.470 --> 02:55:29.773]  You know, they've got reactors blowing up all over the place.
[02:55:29.773 --> 02:55:35.598]  They had one out in California in the fifties, as you know, that nobody knew about for two decades, worse than Chernobyl.
[02:55:35.598 --> 02:55:40.222]  They're putting bisphenol A in everything they know destroys their own future.
[02:55:40.222 --> 02:55:45.346]  What is it about the ruling class that they, for decades, have had reactors that are
[02:55:46.027 --> 02:55:52.451]  From what I've seen, powers of magnitude are safer, statistically.
[02:55:52.451 --> 02:55:55.212]  And they just don't care and don't replace the old ones.
[02:55:55.212 --> 02:55:58.614]  And when they blow up, they say, I don't worry about the radiation, it's now safe.
[02:55:58.614 --> 02:56:01.696]  I mean, 20 years ago, they wouldn't let US troops use DU.
[02:56:01.696 --> 02:56:04.837]  Now they do and say, just don't worry about it, no safety needed.
[02:56:04.837 --> 02:56:07.819]  Every time they fire a gun and breathe it, it's a death sentence.
[02:56:07.819 --> 02:56:09.180]  I mean, what is it with these people?
[02:56:11.226 --> 02:56:12.728]  Well, it's hard to say.
[02:56:12.728 --> 02:56:21.919]  With the nukes, it may be that the new safer reactors, of course, don't make fissionable products as byproducts.
[02:56:21.919 --> 02:56:26.345]  So, that puts a crimp in their nuclear weapons program.
[02:56:26.345 --> 02:56:28.727]  Ah!
[02:56:28.727 --> 02:56:29.749]  That's part of it, I think.
[02:56:31.189 --> 02:56:43.583]  But I mean, what planet are they going to live on if they continue to just... I mean, to have the US military now for 20 years using DU and every type of ammunition and just dying all over the place and it's admitted and they just don't care?
[02:56:44.824 --> 02:56:59.831]  Yeah, hundreds of thousands of our own troops have been poisoned with depleted uranium, will live lives of pain and disability, and will father thousands of children with severe birth defects.
[02:56:59.831 --> 02:57:01.552]  And those people just don't care.
[02:57:05.216 --> 02:57:12.204]  But they had DU in the 50s as you know Dr. Bowman, you were in weapons development, but they didn't decide to start serving it out until 1991.
[02:57:12.204 --> 02:57:13.445]  What changed?
[02:57:13.445 --> 02:57:17.970]  Because we've always had corrupt elites, but what changed in America?
[02:57:17.970 --> 02:57:19.893]  I mean, when did we become the leader in evil?
[02:57:22.472 --> 02:57:41.785]  Well, the big change, the biggest change was the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the takeover of our government in full force by the global elites and their minions in the CIA and so forth.
[02:57:41.785 --> 02:57:43.226]  That's my thought.
[02:57:43.226 --> 02:57:43.926]  No, that's it.
[02:57:43.926 --> 02:57:46.628]  So we've had a military industrial complex coup.
[02:57:46.628 --> 02:57:47.669]  We've had a coup.
[02:57:47.669 --> 02:57:52.052]  And I think it's cute to soft kill the troops.
[02:57:52.052 --> 02:57:52.232]  Yeah.
[02:57:56.686 --> 02:58:01.350]  I guess at the end of the day, we really do have psychopaths running things.
[02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:02.191]  I'm afraid we do.
[02:58:02.191 --> 02:58:04.252]  I mean, it's worse than a sociopath.
[02:58:04.252 --> 02:58:07.134]  I mean, why would a sociopath poison their own nest?
[02:58:07.134 --> 02:58:12.318]  I've seen the generals move into bases in Iraq that have been bombed with D.U.
[02:58:12.318 --> 02:58:15.040]  and they don't even do a basic deacon.
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.441]  I mean, what do those generals think?
[02:58:16.441 --> 02:58:19.324]  They're going to just be magic and nothing's going to hurt them either?
[02:58:19.994 --> 02:58:20.655]  Yeah.
[02:58:20.655 --> 02:58:30.683]  This ties in with the economy because the way to get the dead under control is to end the wars.
[02:58:30.683 --> 02:58:31.824]  Tell you what, stay there, Dot.
[02:58:31.824 --> 02:58:32.324]  One minute break.
[02:58:32.324 --> 02:58:34.766]  We're going to come back and give you the floor on the economy.
[02:58:34.766 --> 02:58:36.828]  For everybody else, main transmission over.
[02:58:36.828 --> 02:58:39.249]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars audio stream.
[02:58:39.249 --> 02:58:39.970]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.970 --> 02:58:47.256]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.256 --> 02:58:49.478]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.901 --> 02:58:55.463]  And your subject of the police action.
[02:58:55.463 --> 02:58:56.724]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:56.724 --> 02:59:00.607]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:59:00.607 --> 02:59:02.909]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:02.909 --> 02:59:08.774]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:59:08.774 --> 02:59:14.999]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:15.419 --> 02:59:21.402]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:21.402 --> 02:59:25.584]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:59:25.584 --> 02:59:29.867]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:29.867 --> 02:59:35.830]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:35.830 --> 02:59:39.372]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:39.372 --> 02:59:41.353]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:41.353 --> 02:59:41.773]  It's here.

[02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:53.642]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.642 --> 02:59:55.703]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.703 --> 03:00:04.990]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.990 --> 03:00:09.794]  The social engineers that run our planet are very intelligent.
[03:00:11.561 --> 03:00:15.946]  They have a lot of idiot savants working for them in areas of specialties.
[03:00:15.946 --> 03:00:22.113]  But at the end of the day, it's like a diver below 100 feet starts getting narcosis.
[03:00:22.113 --> 03:00:24.396]  They start feeling invincible.
[03:00:24.396 --> 03:00:30.764]  That's why you gotta have a buddy down there with you because of what's happening chemically in the brain due to different oxygen levels.
[03:00:31.328 --> 03:00:32.589]  It's the same thing with power.
[03:00:32.589 --> 03:00:34.289]  It tends to go to the head.
[03:00:34.289 --> 03:00:40.612]  There's no other prognosis than the ruling elite of the West are completely out of their minds.
[03:00:40.612 --> 03:00:44.494]  Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest in the little five minutes we've got left.
[03:00:44.494 --> 03:00:54.839]  He was getting into the economy and the wars and this nihilistic, crazy attitude of the social engineers.
[03:00:54.839 --> 03:00:55.960]  Dr. Bowman, please continue.
[03:00:58.553 --> 03:01:07.840]  As I say, get rid of the debt, you end the wars, bring our troops home from the 170 countries around the world where we have them based.
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:12.704]  We can pay the troops and they can spend their money here in the United States.
[03:01:12.704 --> 03:01:14.345]  That'll help the economy.
[03:01:14.345 --> 03:01:22.371]  If you want to help the economy, you make sure every American family is financially secure, that they get a regular paycheck every month.
[03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:29.735]  You put him to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and all the things that need doing.
[03:01:29.735 --> 03:01:32.597]  You pull an FDR.
[03:01:32.597 --> 03:01:34.118]  He got the economy moving.
[03:01:34.118 --> 03:01:40.421]  If we gave the tens of trillions to the American people we gave to the banks, I mean, it would be inflationary, but we'd be in high cotton.
[03:01:40.421 --> 03:01:42.903]  Instead we gave it to the foreign banks.
[03:01:42.903 --> 03:01:49.767]  Yeah, and the fact of the matter is that we could give every American family $40,000 a year
[03:01:53.811 --> 03:02:06.398]  And it would not be inflationary because the current deflationary pressure, recessionary pressure, is so great.
[03:02:06.398 --> 03:02:17.965]  And Nobel Prize winning economists have said, look, you've got all of this, you can print this money and give to people, but they don't want to do that because
[03:02:20.225 --> 03:02:22.026]  They want people in debt.
[03:02:22.026 --> 03:02:24.548]  They want people to borrow, borrow, borrow.
[03:02:24.548 --> 03:02:34.675]  Yeah, to explain that to folks, there's a depression in the real economy, and then they say give us bailouts, but it only goes to the offshore banks, and so it's the worst of both worlds.
[03:02:34.675 --> 03:02:41.219]  But if they really wanted to get out of the recession depression, they would inject the money directly to the people and it'd be over, but they want us dependent.
[03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:43.409]  That's right.
[03:02:43.409 --> 03:02:57.315]  If ordinary working Americans have money, and they know it's going to be there, they don't have to be worried about losing their job, they know they'll have a subsistence income, they'll spend the money.
[03:02:57.315 --> 03:03:05.459]  They'll go to the movies, they'll buy groceries, they'll fix the house, they'll buy a car, and all the businesses will prosper.
[03:03:06.789 --> 03:03:27.821]  But the big businesses, they're at the top of the food chain and they've got so many trillions stashed away and they want more and the only way they can think of to get more is to have people have to borrow it from them so they keep making more interest.
[03:03:27.821 --> 03:03:33.184]  And of course they're earning interest on the national debt too.
[03:03:33.184 --> 03:03:34.265]  They don't want to fix that.
[03:03:36.107 --> 03:03:40.990]  No, they want our credit rating to be dropped so that we are like a third world country.
[03:03:40.990 --> 03:03:44.093]  And so that they can make more interest?
[03:03:44.093 --> 03:03:56.061]  Well, you know, I mean, the fact that S&P would certify the derivatives being sold that were worthless trash knowingly, but then lower the credit rating of the United States, that's a national security issue right there.
[03:03:56.061 --> 03:03:57.422]  But what do we expect?
[03:03:57.422 --> 03:04:01.364]  Obama is bought and paid for by the very same banks that pay for S&P.
[03:04:02.932 --> 03:04:05.194]  Yeah, I'm afraid so.
[03:04:05.194 --> 03:04:09.237]  In many ways he is no better than George W. Bush.
[03:04:09.237 --> 03:04:17.884]  Party at that level means nothing because both of them are owned lock, stock and barrel by these global elites.
[03:04:17.884 --> 03:04:26.510]  Dr. Bob Bowman, I know you're doing a lot these days and out there fighting hard for liberty and you're a great political speaker and I know you are from time to time speaking around the country.
[03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:29.092]  Folks can find out more at thepatriots.us.
[03:04:29.092 --> 03:04:32.095]  If folks want you to speak in their area, can they contact you and get you out there?
[03:04:33.644 --> 03:04:35.685]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:04:35.685 --> 03:04:39.828]  And I think our home phone number's on the website, too.
[03:04:39.828 --> 03:04:42.570]  But the website is woefully out of date.
[03:04:42.570 --> 03:04:48.974]  I've been taking chemotherapy for my cancer, and I've been out of action for a couple of months.
[03:04:48.974 --> 03:04:52.316]  Well, you're a lion, Dr. Bowman.
[03:04:52.316 --> 03:04:55.979]  We appreciate you working so hard and traveling while you battle cancer.
[03:04:55.979 --> 03:04:56.479]  God bless you.
[03:04:56.479 --> 03:04:57.320]  We'll all pray for you.
[03:04:57.320 --> 03:04:59.281]  Folks, we'll see you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:04:59.281 --> 03:04:59.661]  Central.
[03:04:59.661 --> 03:05:00.402]  Great job to the crew.
