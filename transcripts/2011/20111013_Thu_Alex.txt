[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:06.215]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:07.976]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:09.736]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.857]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:17.058]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:21.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:34.228]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is a maximum alert, a maximum alert for all info warriors and people that love peace and liberty worldwide.
[00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:35.790]  Maximum alert.
[00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.752]  Alex Jones here, coming to you from my home.
[00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:43.937]  I knew this was big two days ago when they said they foiled the Iranian plot to blow up the
[00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:47.541]  Uh, Saudi Embassy in D.C.
[00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:51.487]  and assassinate people claiming that it was Mexican drug cartels.
[00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:58.136]  I knew that that was a cover for the Fast and Furious subpoenas that they knew were imminent the next day or yesterday.
[00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:08.748]  Since then, Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, who you better believe speaks for some of the better elements of the Pentagon, and of the ruling elite of this country.
[00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:17.356]  He's reported in part of very important think tanks, heavily involved in trying to kill bin Laden, has blown the whistle on a lot of 9-11 stuff, the Super Congress.
[00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:22.721]  When he basically is unleashed to come out and say something, you know it's important.
[00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:23.782]  Paul Watson's article,
[00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.217]  Uh, is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:33.281]  FBI insider, Obama administration, likely manufactured dubious terror plot.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:40.845]  Uh, and Shaffer talked to a high-level FBI agent with clearances who knows that it's not in the system, that there was not a plot.
[00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:42.726]  Repeat, not a plot.
[00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:45.367]  Then, and again, people think I'm quick.
[00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:46.048]  I'm not really quick.
[00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:48.288]  A lot of this was hiding in plain view.
[00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:51.810]  I knew there'd be some false flag or buildup for war.
[00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.034]  As the spokescreen for Obama's approval rating plunging, the fast and furious coming out, the Democrats calling for him not to run.
[00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:03.557]  And I said last week, if they don't start pulling a new war or false flag, Obama will be toast in one month.
[00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:15.981]  Then I discovered that a member of my family who's an army officer is being sent to Kuwait and was very tight-lipped and then I made some other calls and confirmed it's a green light attack!
[00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:17.803]  Israeli strike on Iran!
[00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.666]  Repeat, within two weeks!
[00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.147]  T-minus two weeks.
[00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:22.027]  It could happen tomorrow.
[00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:23.188]  It could happen next week.
[00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:27.791]  But the main forces and logistics forces for a U.S.
[00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:34.075]  backstrike of the Israelis is building up in Kuwait and surrounding areas right now.
[00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:36.557]  This is an absolute mega alert.
[00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:41.761]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, it could not be any more hardcore.
[00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:48.806]  My phone rings ten times in a row until I jumped off the treadmill this morning, I went over and got it.
[00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:50.527]  Dr. Steve Pachinick.
[00:02:50.527 --> 00:02:58.309]  And, you know, he basically, we know he's establishment, he's run overthrows of major governments, and we know he represents an element of the Pentagon.
[00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:06.212]  He said, you know the Pentagon, knows there's going to be a strike, the bunker busters have been delivered to Israel, we don't want this, that's why Schaefer's gone public.
[00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:11.294]  And he basically put his cards on the table, as if any of us needed him to, and just said, you know,
[00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:13.963]  Well, he's coming on later.
[00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:14.744]  We'll see what he says.
[00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:21.065]  The point is, he's been talking to a lot of people in current government intelligence and the Pentagon, and he said, it's on.
[00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:25.906]  The government, again I would add, could stage terror attacks now and blame it on Iran.
[00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:27.347]  It is on.
[00:03:27.347 --> 00:03:28.747]  It is on.
[00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:29.487]  It is on.
[00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:34.929]  They could go with a new war, stage terror attacks, mass arrests, internet kill switches.
[00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:39.050]  They are testing the waters right now to completely drop the hammer on us.
[00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.432]  Mega red alert, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:48.057]  Again, Mike Adams was going to be here today with, like, four guests on a host of key issues and doing the nightly news tonight.
[00:03:48.057 --> 00:03:54.963]  I was going to be back tomorrow live via Skype, spending some time with my family, and Aaron Dykes doing the nightly news.
[00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.687]  But quite frankly, now I mayâ€”with the great technology, I can broadcast from anywhere.
[00:03:59.687 --> 00:04:02.530]  But this is a maximum, maximum alert.
[00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.534]  I know we're going to break here, but just briefly taking us to break, Mike Adams, what do you think of this information?
[00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:11.464]  Well, Alex, what an extraordinary day in human history, as you mentioned.
[00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:13.246]  This issue is exploding.
[00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:15.969]  The drapes are off, you know.
[00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.292]  The cover stories are exploding in their faces right now.
[00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:28.141]  It's very clear, Alex, that Fast and Furious is what probably led them to have the motivation to start to drum up these other plots to distract people.
[00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:31.625]  It's that sleight-of-mind or sleight-of-hand tactic that they always use.
[00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:40.331]  And we're going to be covering that more here on the Alex Jones Show with Alex himself, with Paul Joseph Watson, and with Dr. Steve Pachinik when we return.
[00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:41.392]  So stay with us right here.
[00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:42.853]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.002]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:08.307]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.829]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:18.637]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.358 --> 00:05:26.883]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:34.888]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:34.888 --> 00:05:42.292]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:48.279]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.642]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.765]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:07.962]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:07.962 --> 00:06:10.524]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.524 --> 00:06:15.888]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:15.888 --> 00:06:18.930]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.992]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:27.497]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:30.879]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:36.663]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:38.304]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:39.605]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:42.267]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:46.490]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.532]  You can find the video at www.
[00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:02.057]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:07:02.057 --> 00:07:14.321]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:16.862]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also
[00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:17.582]  We're good.
[00:07:33.135 --> 00:07:33.515]  We're good to go.
[00:08:00.373 --> 00:08:05.778]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:08.059]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.912]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:20.014]  It is the 13th day of October, 2011.
[00:08:20.014 --> 00:08:23.756]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.296]  And yes, I'm not in studio.
[00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.457]  I'm on telephone.
[00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:37.041]  I was planning to take a few days off with my children, but broadcast via Skype with a lot of important guests coming up on Friday, Monday, Tuesday.
[00:08:37.993 --> 00:08:47.016]  Before returning to the studio and Mike Adams was going to be sitting in today and will be sitting in in studio for InfoWars radio show slash TV.
[00:08:47.016 --> 00:08:54.458]  InfoWars live as we call it and then coming back tonight with InfoWars Nightly News his maiden hosting of that.
[00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.919]  Aaron Dykes is doing the Nightly News 7 p.m.
[00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:57.439]  tomorrow.
[00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:00.420]  We appreciate the great work he's doing.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know for two days people have asked me what I think about the
[00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:12.792]  Now confirmed, manufactured, fake, Iran-Saudi embassy attack story.
[00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:18.035]  And a lot of things were staring me right in the face, but I wanted to be deliberative on this.
[00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:21.797]  So I want to give you the announcement right now.
[00:09:21.797 --> 00:09:28.921]  This is the most important and, quite frankly, most ominous radio show I have done.
[00:09:29.998 --> 00:09:40.224]  Since July 25, 2011, when I said the government was going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset, Osama Bin Laden and launch wars.
[00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.105]  I could see the preconditioning.
[00:09:42.105 --> 00:09:44.826]  I didn't have all the sources I have now.
[00:09:44.826 --> 00:09:50.089]  I have two military sources, known to me.
[00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.051]  Two military sources.
[00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:58.034]  Then separately, I have a family military source, who wouldn't give me details, but that's how I went and found out more.
[00:09:59.273 --> 00:10:01.634]  I have Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.256]  I have Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer of U.S.
[00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:07.658]  Army.
[00:10:07.658 --> 00:10:10.980]  And more to tell you what I'm telling you now.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.481]  I'm going to give you the complete skinny right now.
[00:10:13.481 --> 00:10:14.442]  We're going to go to a clip.
[00:10:14.442 --> 00:10:18.324]  Again, Mike Adams is waiting in the wings here.
[00:10:18.324 --> 00:10:22.246]  It's very simple.
[00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.367]  The federal government
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:33.883]  was induced in the last three years under Fast and Furious to ship tens of thousands of firearms into Mexico.
[00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:44.467]  Cocaine was then shipped back into the United States under ATF, FBI, DEA, Coast Guard, Border Patrol, and several other agencies authorization.
[00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:52.570]  Foreign intelligence agencies, including Israel, but also elements of our own intelligence agencies in the Pentagon, there's different camps,
[00:10:53.924 --> 00:11:06.194]  Then began to leak that information so they could then blackmail domestic agencies and domestic leaders of agencies to go along with the police state takeover of the United States.
[00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:13.439]  To make sure that that happened, they needed outside war and to tie it into the cartels.
[00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:22.086]  That's what was done two days ago, as they knew that within less than 24 hours, Congressman Issa's subpoenas to the admitted liar
[00:11:22.845 --> 00:11:27.167]  Attorney General John P. Holdren were going out.
[00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:29.569]  Connecting it to Mexican cartels again.
[00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:35.091]  Oh now look, Obama is fighting the Mexican cartels that he's really shipping guns to.
[00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:39.934]  Several weeks ago, as you know, a second shipment of Bunker Buster missiles were delivered to Israel.
[00:11:40.802 --> 00:11:47.244]  We had Ray McGovern on last week, former top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[00:11:47.244 --> 00:11:52.206]  saying, from his sources, this is the greatest green light ever for an Iran attack.
[00:11:52.206 --> 00:12:01.549]  Remember, Fox Palin four years ago, the head of CENTCOM, had to resign, refused to attack Iran with the fake PT boat thing that Cheney wanted to do, having fake PT boats attack our destroyers.
[00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:13.176]  Right now, they have 100% green-lighted a giant bombardment on Iran within the next two weeks.
[00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:18.477]  Israel could launch an attack tomorrow or any time in the next two weeks.
[00:12:18.477 --> 00:12:18.797]  U.S.
[00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:28.080]  military logistics forces, fighter-bomber pilots, helicopter pilots, ships, you name it, are all massing in and around the Persian Gulf.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.641]  I have family who has just been deployed yesterday to Kuwait, 20-plus years in the military.
[00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:41.123]  The Pentagon has been put into logistics, readying helicopters for the Gulf.
[00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:42.123]  It is on.
[00:12:42.123 --> 00:12:44.684]  The military does not want this.
[00:12:44.684 --> 00:12:48.666]  Repeat, the military does not want this.
[00:12:48.666 --> 00:13:01.933]  Elements in the Pentagon that are good have loosed Colonel Schaefer, who of course blew the whistle on Abel Danger and other ops, who of course blew the whistle that the Pentagon is upset about the Super Congress and a move towards Obama trying to become a dictator.
[00:13:03.177 --> 00:13:14.465]  So the White Hats in the Pentagon have now gone public, and here's the headline, FBI insider, Obama administration, likely manufactured, dubious terror plot.
[00:13:14.465 --> 00:13:17.307]  This is from yesterday, it's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:17.307 --> 00:13:20.389]  This article needs to get out to everybody by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:21.893 --> 00:13:33.323]  I cannot stress to you enough that it's not just a distraction from Fast and Furious with people saying Obama needs to step down, Democrats saying don't run again, his approval rating and freefall.
[00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:43.772]  That's the intelligence agencies globally and the private corporations and others positioning Obama for destruction if he doesn't do what he's told.
[00:13:43.772 --> 00:13:46.014]  That's getting all the agencies, eight of them,
[00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.291]  Caught red-handed.
[00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:58.861]  They had to do it system-wide in every major city, getting FBI, ATF, DEA, and others involved shipping the guns so that even mid-level managers are now facing prison.
[00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:02.984]  Now they're being told, go along with martial law.
[00:14:02.984 --> 00:14:03.765]  My phone rang.
[00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.431]  Eight or ten times this morning.
[00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.332]  Ring, ring, ring.
[00:14:07.332 --> 00:14:09.034]  Pachinick never does that.
[00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:10.735]  And he basically just put his cards on the table.
[00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:12.456]  He goes, you know, I work with a lot of agencies.
[00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:14.398]  Yeah, he wrote the handbook on black ops.
[00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:17.480]  He goes, the good guys at the Pentagon don't want this, just like Schaefer.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.282]  He goes, I want you to know you serve your country.
[00:14:19.282 --> 00:14:21.183]  You know, a lot of people appreciate it.
[00:14:21.183 --> 00:14:22.925]  You need to know the government's not all bad.
[00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:24.506]  The Pentagon doesn't want this attack.
[00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:27.128]  I mean, he was just right there, not even mincing words.
[00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:30.170]  As if we needed to know, Pachinick, you know, is still involved in black ops.
[00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.631]  Give me a break.
[00:14:31.252 --> 00:14:35.433]  The point is, he said they're getting ready to totally drop the hammer.
[00:14:35.433 --> 00:14:37.814]  It could lead into martial law, you name it.
[00:14:37.814 --> 00:14:41.755]  I cannot stress to you we've got to stop this war.
[00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:42.896]  This is the key.
[00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:49.438]  If they're able to sell this bogus baloney that I ran,
[00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:50.853]  We're good to go.
[00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:22.438]  The globalists will then stage terror attacks all over the West, they will clamp down the media, Obama's approval rating will go to 85%, and they will ram through the austerity, the banker bailouts, all of it.
[00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:23.759]  This is it.
[00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:27.502]  I told you, a war, false flag, all of it was coming.
[00:15:27.502 --> 00:15:28.163]  It's here.
[00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:28.804]  They're about to.
[00:15:28.804 --> 00:15:31.866]  But the good news is, you see, the power structure doesn't like it, a lot of them.
[00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:36.169]  That's why there's all these articles, even the New York Times says this Iran thing is bull.
[00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:39.172]  That's because a lot of people in the power structure have been brought to the edge of the cliff.
[00:15:40.003 --> 00:15:41.743]  And they realize what's about to happen.
[00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:46.385]  It's called World War 3.
[00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:54.046]  The Iran situation goes from $10 a gallon gas and wars and terror attacks on the good end to World War 3 on the bad end.
[00:15:54.046 --> 00:15:54.727]  From bad to worse.
[00:15:54.727 --> 00:15:59.988]  Let's play this clip of Anthony Schaefer with Judge Andrew Napolitano yesterday on Fox Business.
[00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:00.468]  Here it is.
[00:16:01.345 --> 00:16:05.648]  Yesterday, the FBI alleged it had foiled an Iranian terror plot.
[00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:09.150]  But the main suspect has been in custody since September.
[00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.333]  So why did the Department of Justice wait until now to announce this threat?
[00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:31.185]  Is it mere coincidence as it comes at a time when House Republicans, as you've just heard, subpoenaed the head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Holder himself, for his marred gun-running program, Operation Fast and Furious, which, as you know, let military-grade weaponry get in the hands of Mexican drug gangs.
[00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:37.132]  Or is there another explanation for this curious announcement that Mr. Holder made yesterday?
[00:16:37.132 --> 00:16:42.199]  Joining us by phone from Virginia is retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer.
[00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:44.362]  Colonel Schaefer, it's always a pleasure.
[00:16:44.362 --> 00:16:45.543]  Welcome back to Freedom Watch.
[00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:46.344]  Thank you for having me, Judge.
[00:16:46.344 --> 00:16:46.985]  Sorry I can't be there.
[00:16:47.825 --> 00:16:50.147]  As are we, but we appreciate you picking up the phone and calling us.
[00:16:50.147 --> 00:16:55.991]  What is your take on this alleged terror plot involving Iran?
[00:16:55.991 --> 00:17:02.936]  Is this the way the Iran intelligence agencies usually operate?
[00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:12.542]  Engaging with somebody they thought were involved with Mexican drug gangs to assassinate a Saudi Arabian ambassador in a public restaurant in New York or Washington?
[00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:17.846]  Well, it's a long way to get to a much easier target in other places, and no, I don't think so.
[00:17:17.846 --> 00:17:21.329]  And obviously, I've interrogated the Iranians.
[00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.211]  Two chapters in my book, Operation Dark Heart, are dedicated to this.
[00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.613]  And that's what makes me think twice about this.
[00:17:26.613 --> 00:17:32.197]  The American that they're accusing here, Judge, was true enough, he has a dual passport, Iranian-American.
[00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:36.180]  Frankly, my experience has been directly that these people love being here.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.401]  Once they're here, they love being here.
[00:17:37.401 --> 00:17:52.866]  And the idea of this guy, all of a sudden, after years being a successful, by all accounts, a successful used car salesman in Texas, part of the community, I would think it would be very difficult to imagine him all of a sudden deciding that he's going to go against everything he's done for the past 15 years.
[00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:55.969]  To do this.
[00:17:55.969 --> 00:17:58.170]  It does not spell correctly at this point in time.
[00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.912]  Alright, well give me, if you would, your best estimate as to what does spell correctly.
[00:18:02.912 --> 00:18:12.937]  For example, is it possible that this Iranian-American is a double agent who wanted to trick the government of the United States of America into taking some action against Iran?
[00:18:13.297 --> 00:18:16.440]  Is it likely that the FBI concocted this whole thing?
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.182]  And because it was a sting, nobody was ever in danger.
[00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:20.443]  There was never a real plot.
[00:18:20.443 --> 00:18:24.726]  This guy was plotting with FBI agents who he thought were Mexican drug lords.
[00:18:24.726 --> 00:18:26.828]  What does Colonel Schaefer think really went down here?
[00:18:26.828 --> 00:18:32.492]  I think as part of it, I think the reason it came out now is literally this is red meat to a bunch of lions.
[00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:35.454]  You know, I think this is why they threw it out now at this point, not in September.
[00:18:35.454 --> 00:18:38.016]  Secondly, yeah, the FBI's had a record lately.
[00:18:39.036 --> 00:18:42.898]  I did talk to one of my inside guys today and he is saying that he thinks the same thing.
[00:18:42.898 --> 00:18:43.678]  You know why?
[00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:47.300]  Because he can't find any real information and he's got a clearance.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.402]  So that tells him that there's something going on that's extraordinary by the fact that he's an inside, you know, investigator.
[00:18:52.833 --> 00:19:01.679]  There's nothing on this within the DOJ beyond what they've talked about publicly, which means to him there's something very wrong with it.
[00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:09.504]  Look, the United States used failed and flawed intelligence to attack Iraq in 1991 and in 2003.
[00:19:09.504 --> 00:19:14.488]  Is there the danger that we might use something as preposterous as this plot, which was
[00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:17.910]  Right, I gotta tell you, I do believe the Iranians do pose a threat.
[00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.432]  However, I agree with you on this.
[00:19:19.432 --> 00:19:21.834]  There's no reason to believe at this point
[00:19:35.635 --> 00:19:42.180]  The rest of the clip is up at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:48.304]  We're going to be right back with Mike Adams, Paul Watson is joining us, Dr. Steve Pachenek and more.
[00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:49.145]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:50.866]  This is one of the most important broadcasts ever.
[00:20:00.254 --> 00:20:07.219]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.
[00:20:07.219 --> 00:20:18.207]  Our Iodine Protection Packs include Micro Plant Powder, Green Life Kelp, Red Palm Oil, and our clear Roll-On Iodine that will feed the body the iodine it needs.

[00:20:29.716 --> 00:20:39.042]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:39.823]  This capitalism?
[00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:46.107]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.107 --> 00:20:46.968]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:46.968 --> 00:20:50.230]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.030]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.431]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:20:52.431 --> 00:20:52.751]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.032]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:06.458]  What you're about to hear is the real experience of women over 40 who finally lost weight, even around the stubborn belly area.
[00:21:06.458 --> 00:21:06.999]  How?
[00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.139]  By becoming hormonally balanced again.
[00:21:09.139 --> 00:21:12.260]  Their secret is the Amberin Slim After 40 program.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.802]  Amberin is the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:20.705]  You see, the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:24.128]  Unless you balance your hormones, losing weight may be impossible.
[00:21:24.128 --> 00:21:28.091]  But the Ambarin Slim After 40 program changes all of that.
[00:21:28.091 --> 00:21:30.673]  Ambarin restores hormonal balance naturally.
[00:21:30.673 --> 00:21:36.979]  Plus, it dramatically boosts your cell metabolism, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:21:36.979 --> 00:21:44.305]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:51.390]  1-800-894-8776.
[00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:04.178]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:22:04.178 --> 00:22:05.679]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:14.582]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:22:14.582 --> 00:22:18.004]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:18.904]  But take heart.
[00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:22.846]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:27.828]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:22:28.248 --> 00:22:32.089]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:33.809]  The globalists are scared.
[00:22:33.809 --> 00:22:35.149]  They've overreached.
[00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:38.670]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:22:56.313 --> 00:22:57.573]  The Info War now.
[00:22:57.833 --> 00:22:59.574]  Goes into high gear!
[00:22:59.574 --> 00:23:02.094]  Big Berkey Water Filters are in high demand.

[00:24:07.381 --> 00:24:09.342]  Okay, we got Paul Watson waiting in the wings.
[00:24:09.342 --> 00:24:10.962]  He's just popping in for a few minutes here.
[00:24:10.962 --> 00:24:14.763]  Mike Adams is going to be hosting the whole show, but I'll leave here in about 20 minutes.
[00:24:14.763 --> 00:24:17.204]  It's Dr. Steve McKinnick popping in on the next segment.
[00:24:17.204 --> 00:24:22.186]  He concurs with my analysis and says he has that from his intelligence agency, Connections.
[00:24:22.186 --> 00:24:25.787]  Remember, this is the guy who's literally overthrown government.
[00:24:25.787 --> 00:24:27.947]  And he says that he has the power structure right now.
[00:24:27.947 --> 00:24:29.668]  He's in a big fight.
[00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:33.489]  He said Israel wants to go in and attack right now.
[00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:39.052]  And, folks, we don't want World War III, but Mike Adams wants it to pop in later.
[00:24:39.052 --> 00:24:40.312]  He's going to have a report out on this.
[00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.514]  It'll pop in later during the show.
[00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.975]  But Mike Adams asked me a question during the break.
[00:24:44.975 --> 00:24:47.396]  He said, why is it Saudi ambassadors?
[00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:47.717]  Why?
[00:24:47.717 --> 00:24:53.560]  Well, notice Mexico's involved, so that kind of muddies the water with the drug runner, gun runner thing.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.801]  Saudi Arabia was used in the fable of 9-11.
[00:24:57.801 --> 00:25:00.742]  Saudi Arabia was used with the Mujahideen against the Russians.
[00:25:00.742 --> 00:25:04.764]  Saudi Arabia is big allies with the U.S., England, and Israel.
[00:25:04.764 --> 00:25:10.006]  And Saudi Arabia, there's plausible deniability now to say, oh, there was a plot to bomb your embassy.
[00:25:10.006 --> 00:25:11.026]  That way it's not a U.S.
[00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:11.366]  embassy.
[00:25:11.366 --> 00:25:14.208]  So it's always the same players.
[00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:19.730]  And again, you heard Colonel Schaefer saying, he talked to the high-level Justice Department, the word is FBI.
[00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.030]  Schaefer's on tomorrow.
[00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.931]  He was getting on a plane when Jaron called him this morning.
[00:25:23.553 --> 00:25:24.896]  To be on MSNBC about this.
[00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:29.555]  You know, Schaefer's saying high-level.
[00:25:29.555 --> 00:25:32.336]  The Justice Department said it's not the computers.
[00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:33.136]  It's fake.
[00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:34.176]  It's not real.
[00:25:34.176 --> 00:25:35.476]  It's totally manufactured.
[00:25:35.476 --> 00:25:36.857]  It's perfect timing.
[00:25:36.857 --> 00:25:39.077]  The day before the subpoenas went out.
[00:25:39.077 --> 00:25:41.057]  And Israel's got the bunker busters.
[00:25:41.057 --> 00:25:42.958]  My cousin has just been deployed.
[00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.258]  Twenty-something years in the Army.
[00:25:44.258 --> 00:25:45.798]  I called other Army sources.
[00:25:45.798 --> 00:25:47.779]  They said, how do you know this stuff?
[00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.099]  They said, I'm not talking to you.
[00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:51.199]  These are people I've known for a long time.
[00:25:51.199 --> 00:25:54.640]  Then Steve Pachinic calls up, saying, it's on, it's on.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.440]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:25:56.145 --> 00:26:01.463]  It has never been greenlighted like this, except when Fox Fallon said no and they fired him from CENTCOM.
[00:26:02.324 --> 00:26:05.166]  The military knows this is disastrous.
[00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:06.988]  Paul Watson, what's your intel on this?
[00:26:06.988 --> 00:26:08.949]  I know you've got an article coming out.
[00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:11.511]  We are on the verge of World War III.
[00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:12.492]  They are launching it.
[00:26:12.492 --> 00:26:14.433]  That's from multiple sources, Paul.
[00:26:14.433 --> 00:26:17.275]  We've got to get the article out and warn people.
[00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:24.441]  The government blew its own cover on Fast and Furious to blackmail eight different federal agencies.
[00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:27.803]  Eight federal agencies took the bait in this criminal conspiracy.
[00:26:27.803 --> 00:26:28.904]  They're being blackmailed now.
[00:26:28.904 --> 00:26:29.905]  Do you understand that, Paul?
[00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:46.527]  Well, I mean, this makes the terror plots manufactured by the Bush administration, which of course it was admitted that many of them were manufactured by Tom Ridge, former Homeland Security Director, makes them look sophisticated in comparison to this.
[00:26:47.288 --> 00:26:56.414]  I mean, it's so transparently fabricated that even the New York Times and the Washington Post today are having to admit that it's dubious to say the least.
[00:26:56.414 --> 00:27:11.303]  Because we're being asked to believe that the elite Iranian Al-Quds Force hired a used car salesman from Corpus Christi to then hire assassins to blow up embassies and restaurants in Washington, D.C.
[00:27:11.303 --> 00:27:15.166]  in order to try and kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States.
[00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:22.456]  Obviously, again, it involves Mexican Los Zetas gang members.
[00:27:22.456 --> 00:27:24.378]  They were supposedly part of the plot.
[00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:27.062]  He was trying to pay them off to carry out the assassination.
[00:27:27.062 --> 00:27:34.271]  They were trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, and are used to knock out the drug cartels that aren't laundering their money.
[00:27:34.271 --> 00:27:35.192]  This is ridiculous!
[00:27:36.618 --> 00:27:46.641]  Well yeah, I mean, court transcripts from the past few months have proven again and again that Lost Setters is completely infiltrated in cahoots with the federal government.
[00:27:46.641 --> 00:27:51.343]  They received many of the weapons that were part of the Fast and Furious cover-up.
[00:27:52.023 --> 00:28:09.554]  But I mean, aside from the ludicrous notion that Iran would risk carrying out such a hit inside the United States when it would be far easier to do so anywhere in the Middle East, you know, aside from the fact that this highly trained al-Quds Iranian elite revolutionary god
[00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:15.516]  Force, who are highly trained, would entrust this plot to a used car salesman.
[00:28:15.516 --> 00:28:22.599]  As you just said, Schaefer dropped the bombshell last night on Judge Andrew Napolitano's Fox Business Show.
[00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:34.264]  He talked to an FBI investigator with the necessary security clearance, who went into the back channels, into the archives, and found no information whatsoever regarding the plot.
[00:28:34.884 --> 00:28:39.287]  Which obviously directly suggests that it's been completely fabricated out of only cloth.
[00:28:39.287 --> 00:28:42.530]  Well it means they're covering it up and have expunged it because they're running it or it doesn't exist.
[00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:53.697]  Exactly, and isn't it ironic that the Obama administration has fabricated this hoax about Iran conducting assassinations on U.S.
[00:28:53.697 --> 00:29:10.079]  soil, when we know from the Bush-era program, which was continued by Obama, that the Central Intelligence Agency works with Jundullah, the Iranian Sunni Al-Qaeda group, to carry out bombings and assassinations in Iran to destabilize their government on a regular basis.
[00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:11.680]  So why not five years ago put a press release out on it?
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.980]  Paul, I need you to get an article out.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.221]  With a searing headline, because a headline can't talk about how powerful this is.
[00:29:18.221 --> 00:29:20.261]  There's no way to be too sensational.
[00:29:20.261 --> 00:29:30.724]  I've got sources across the board, including family who won't talk, but I know where they're going, that it is on, it is on, it is on.
[00:29:30.724 --> 00:29:36.885]  Just like I told people they were going to bring down Qaddafi and invade in September, two months before it happened.
[00:29:36.885 --> 00:29:39.926]  It is on, folks, it is on.
[00:29:39.926 --> 00:29:40.906]  I want to repeat this.
[00:29:40.906 --> 00:29:41.646]  They are planning.
[00:29:42.126 --> 00:29:45.448]  An Israeli-led bombardment on Iran, and people say, well, how does this indict him?
[00:29:45.448 --> 00:29:46.449]  It's just this idea.
[00:29:46.449 --> 00:29:49.611]  Well, they tried to attack America, you know, blowing up an embassy.
[00:29:49.611 --> 00:29:51.012]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.012 --> 00:29:53.553]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.553 --> 00:29:56.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.491 --> 00:30:05.513]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:08.755]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.755 --> 00:30:13.917]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:13.917 --> 00:30:19.941]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:19.941 --> 00:30:22.182]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.702 --> 00:30:24.344]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:25.485]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.485 --> 00:30:27.728]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.624 --> 00:30:48.907]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:48.907 --> 00:30:58.011]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:01.178 --> 00:31:02.879]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:02.879 --> 00:31:08.181]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.181 --> 00:31:09.721]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:18.505]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:26.771]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:34.776]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:40.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.162]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-
[00:31:43.683 --> 00:31:48.148]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.

[00:31:59.636 --> 00:32:04.179]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.179 --> 00:32:05.100]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.523]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.523 --> 00:32:09.383]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.383 --> 00:32:14.267]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.267 --> 00:32:15.027]  It's true.
[00:32:15.027 --> 00:32:19.891]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:20.712]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.712 --> 00:32:24.294]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.294 --> 00:32:27.997]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.197 --> 00:32:28.998]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.998 --> 00:32:31.761]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.761 --> 00:32:35.445]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.445 --> 00:32:36.226]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.226 --> 00:32:40.371]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:45.136]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:49.597]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.597 --> 00:32:51.378]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.378 --> 00:32:53.619]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:55.980]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:10.948 --> 00:33:13.369]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:33:13.369 --> 00:33:16.090]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:22.293]  Dr. Steve Pachenek will join us for a longer interview tomorrow once I'm on a better Skype connection.
[00:33:22.293 --> 00:33:23.253]  We have also
[00:33:28.273 --> 00:33:31.394]  We're riding shotgun today, was going to be hosting the whole show.
[00:33:31.394 --> 00:33:34.576]  Mike Adams in studio there at the InfoWars studios.
[00:33:34.576 --> 00:33:36.658]  He'll be doing InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:33:36.658 --> 00:33:46.784]  This evening we do have Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, who came on a month ago and said that the Pentagon is upset about the move towards dictatorship of the Super Congress here in America.
[00:33:46.784 --> 00:33:50.786]  Schaefer basically speaks for the better elements of the Pentagon.
[00:33:50.786 --> 00:33:52.047]  There are different power structures.
[00:33:53.011 --> 00:33:54.452]  He was on Freedom Watch yesterday.
[00:33:54.452 --> 00:33:59.996]  FBI insider, Obama administration is manufacturing this dubious terror plot.
[00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:00.817]  It doesn't exist.
[00:34:00.817 --> 00:34:05.821]  It's made up according to his FBI high-level security clearance source.
[00:34:05.821 --> 00:34:11.025]  Dr. Steve Pichanek contacted me this morning and said from his Pentagon sources and others, they don't want to hit Iran.
[00:34:11.025 --> 00:34:16.209]  And that this is all basically a setup for the buildup for Israel to hit them.
[00:34:16.209 --> 00:34:18.430]  I have family that's been deployed to Kuwait.
[00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.392]  I won't talk about it.
[00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:21.973]  But I know what he works, and it's logistics.
[00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:27.514]  And helicopter gunships, getting those ready for there in the Persian Gulf.
[00:34:27.514 --> 00:34:32.596]  And I've made some calls to other military sources when I learned this two nights ago.
[00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:34.797]  And they said, how on earth do you know this?
[00:34:34.797 --> 00:34:36.938]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:34:36.938 --> 00:34:38.839]  The word is that the U.S.
[00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:41.901]  military is preparing to back up Israel.
[00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:49.165]  When the Iranians close the Strait of Hormuz, a gallon of gas will go from $8 to $10 conservatively.
[00:34:50.092 --> 00:34:51.954]  Uh, the Iranians will probably respond.
[00:34:51.954 --> 00:34:55.317]  Uh, different intelligence agencies can stage terror attacks.
[00:34:55.317 --> 00:34:56.479]  Also blame it on Iran.
[00:34:56.479 --> 00:34:59.922]  Uh, Russia, China could get involved.
[00:34:59.922 --> 00:35:04.467]  This will undoubtedly destroy the economy, but it'll be a nice political diversion.
[00:35:04.467 --> 00:35:06.369]  What did Gerald Solente and others say?
[00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:08.230]  Look for a big war.
[00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.433]  Uh, what did Lindsey Williams say a year ago on our show?
[00:35:10.433 --> 00:35:11.634]  He said, next is Iran.
[00:35:13.053 --> 00:35:15.757]  And that's from his big oil company, Insiders.
[00:35:15.757 --> 00:35:17.118]  And I know who those sources are.
[00:35:17.118 --> 00:35:17.719]  One of them's died.
[00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:18.841]  Now we can talk about it.
[00:35:18.841 --> 00:35:21.504]  Ken Fromm, the former head of Atlantic Richfield.
[00:35:21.504 --> 00:35:23.927]  The other one's even more high-powered.
[00:35:23.927 --> 00:35:30.455]  So we have all that information right there.
[00:35:30.455 --> 00:35:31.697]  And Schaefer,
[00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:45.310]  Came on a month ago and said, yes, Pentagon people at a high level, he's basically a mouthpiece for them at a certain level, he's joining us tomorrow, are upset about Obama moving towards a super congress and dictatorship.
[00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.354]  Schaefer's concerned about that.
[00:35:50.354 --> 00:35:54.338]  I know Dr. Steve Pchenik, whose bio is too long, will be joining us for longer tomorrow.
[00:35:54.338 --> 00:35:55.459]  He's waiting on the wings right now.
[00:35:56.526 --> 00:36:03.533]  Uh, you know, the co-author of Tom Clancy's book, you know that, Rand Blackoffs, wrote the book, The State Department on Psychological Warfare.
[00:36:03.533 --> 00:36:07.076]  Uh, he hardly ever calls me, and this morning he was calling over and over again.
[00:36:07.076 --> 00:36:17.066]  I was on the treadmill, and I jumped off and ran over there, and he said, just immediately, I started calling about the Iran thing, and he said, yes, you know, I'll let him say it in his own words, but crystallized Dr. Pachinnik,
[00:36:18.002 --> 00:36:25.388]  Uh, everything you're telling me is what I have from three military sources, what I've got from Schaefer, what I've got from Common Sense.
[00:36:25.388 --> 00:36:32.053]  Uh, this is incredible, uh, that a high-level FBI with the highest level security clearance says this plot doesn't exist.
[00:36:32.053 --> 00:36:40.340]  We're to believe Los Zetas, we know, trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, and are narcotics enforcers for big central bank, uh, systems.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.660]  We're good to go.
[00:36:56.665 --> 00:37:04.290]  You know, I talked to a lot of people, you know, a lot of people in intelligence appreciate the service you're doing, and I'm not getting into ego here.
[00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:12.715]  The point is, I got from what you were saying that you've got a lot of sources, like Schaefer does, and that there are good guys in the government, the Pentagon, that are upset about what's happening.
[00:37:12.715 --> 00:37:15.197]  So let's put the cards on the table.
[00:37:15.197 --> 00:37:18.259]  The intel I've got is a strike on Iran by Israel.
[00:37:18.259 --> 00:37:19.880]  Within two weeks, the U.S.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.662]  then responding when Iran totally shuts down the oil supply.
[00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:53.901]  Well, the issue, and I can't thank you enough, and I know our country, the real military and the real patriots in the intelligence community really love you and really are grateful I came on because, once again, as a citizen, I'm not a hero, I'm a citizen saying, once again, that this whole issue that came out of Mexico, this entire nonsensical story, which even Buehler shamefully said was a Hollywood script, which it is, and it's a very bad script,
[00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:55.202]  We're good to go.
[00:38:13.882 --> 00:38:14.242]  I don't know.
[00:38:31.813 --> 00:38:48.968]  Who's a war hero from the Vietnam, has won major awards, and was a combat hero, has been involved in 9-11, now is involved in this nonsensical story to create a pretext for an attack by Israel on Iran.
[00:38:48.968 --> 00:38:50.169]  Now why do I say that?
[00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:52.151]  Because two things happened.
[00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:56.995]  When I heard this nonsensical intelligence report by DEA, ATF,
[00:38:57.495 --> 00:38:57.955]  I think so.
[00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:32.637]  And Hillary Clinton, a woman who is pathologically a liar, incompetent, is reaffirming that Iran, who has repeatedly said we don't need to attack the United States on their home base.
[00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:33.878]  I know the Iranians.
[00:39:33.878 --> 00:39:35.939]  I was involved with Khomeini.
[00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:37.820]  I was involved with Rouhani.
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.101]  I don't love them, but I have respect for them.
[00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:40.881]  I don't know.
[00:39:58.457 --> 00:39:59.518]  And Afghanistan.
[00:39:59.518 --> 00:40:02.639]  So both Biden is lying and is incompetent.
[00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:07.461]  And by the way, his in-law is Tom Donilon, who really should not be there.
[00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:09.902]  Obama, once again, is lying.
[00:40:09.902 --> 00:40:12.363]  Once again, should be considered for impeachment.
[00:40:12.363 --> 00:40:14.504]  We have serious war crimes here.
[00:40:14.504 --> 00:40:15.764]  Now, why do I say this?
[00:40:15.764 --> 00:40:21.466]  Because two weeks ago, and the reporters didn't mention this, cluster bombs were sent to Israel.
[00:40:21.466 --> 00:40:24.688]  Now, there is no reason for Israel to receive cluster bombs.
[00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:27.789]  Cluster bombs are used to break up the tarmacs
[00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.729]  I think?
[00:40:45.254 --> 00:41:00.016]  So, Israel is not going to be using a cluster bomb, but Israel needs to divert attention away from its domestic problems, where a million people have been unemployed, from the fact that it has an incompetent, dysfunctional civilian government in Netanyahu.
[00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:08.831]  And we'll create a war to divert that attention because the state of Palestine will be and should be recognized by the UN.
[00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:12.232]  And this is exactly what should happen around the world.
[00:41:12.232 --> 00:41:27.337]  In order to divert that attention, it has convinced Joseph Biden and Hillary Clinton, two major supporters of the Jewish community here, so that it can be mobilized in order to support an Obama election, which does not look very likely.
[00:41:27.877 --> 00:41:34.381]  And ironically, Obama is creating another incident in the same way when Bush Jr.
[00:41:34.381 --> 00:41:53.514]  had very low approval in the ratings, when the unemployment was very high, and unlike George Bush Jr., whom I feel would have been the worst president, Obama is turning out to be by far the worst incompetent president we have ever had, who really should be impeached for the lies he committed,
[00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:57.915]  For the travesties of justice, and now for the incompetency.
[00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:04.157]  You have Biden, you have Hillary Clinton, you have Mueller, you have Panetta, all civilians.
[00:42:04.157 --> 00:42:19.181]  But that does not explain why our military, which has had to retreat from two wars, and has been used as cannon fodder by civilians who were totally incompetent and sent into war to die for our country.
[00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:20.481]  We have the most brilliant
[00:42:21.281 --> 00:42:25.525]  We have effective leaders in our military that I've never seen in 30 years.
[00:42:25.525 --> 00:42:27.026]  They have been quiet.
[00:42:27.026 --> 00:42:36.474]  They have followed orders, but they are sick and tired of listening to incompetent civilians sending out brave men and women into battle and dying.
[00:42:36.474 --> 00:42:44.421]  We have special forces that work 24-7, time all over the world to knock out extremists, and yet they get no support.
[00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:47.442]  Our veterans get no support back here.
[00:42:47.442 --> 00:42:59.487]  And now, in order to promote Obama's election, he has gone to war again and created this nonsense.
[00:42:59.487 --> 00:43:05.349]  It is so absurd, this nonsense, that Iran is about to attack the United States.
[00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.590]  Iran does not have to attack the United States.
[00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:13.713]  As a matter of fact, when I was involved with Khomeini, not one of our hostages was ever injured.
[00:43:14.293 --> 00:43:15.734]  By homing me.
[00:43:15.734 --> 00:43:38.468]  It was, in fact, the terrorist group, the MEK, which is being supported by Freeh, a former head of the FBI, and what's called the Moussa Khadim, that killed some of my CIA operatives, my State Department operatives, and they, in turn, are being supported by some of the prominent, both liberals and right-wingers who are receiving money.
[00:43:38.468 --> 00:43:41.790]  If you look at the list of the MEK, it's an issue we should talk about.
[00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.532]  They want them off the terrorist list.
[00:43:44.532 --> 00:43:52.560]  The real terrorists were the Musa Hadid who killed all of our civilians and operatives in Tehran.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.623]  Dr. Pachinik, this is Mike Adams here.
[00:43:55.623 --> 00:43:59.887]  You're not able to hear Alex because he's on his cell phone, but Alex, what's your take on all this?
[00:44:02.134 --> 00:44:02.694]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:19.519]  I think so.
[00:44:41.531 --> 00:44:48.894]  What are your current sources, and we know you've got a lot of them, are they concurring with what I've been told?
[00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:59.939]  That Israel right now is test ballooning and intends to hit Iran in the next two weeks with bunker busters and cluster bombs to stop their Air Force retaliatory strike.
[00:44:59.939 --> 00:45:07.402]  They've just put into place more anti- medium-range anti-ballistic missile systems.
[00:45:08.385 --> 00:45:17.658]  And the word we've got is, the attack on Iran has now been green-lighted, they've put up this balloon, oh look, Iran's gonna attack us, and then it is on.
[00:45:17.658 --> 00:45:20.081]  So A, what is your intel on that?
[00:45:20.081 --> 00:45:23.666]  A. B, what do you expect the Iranians to do?
[00:45:24.447 --> 00:45:35.214]  One of the different things that can happen if Iran is struck, because the people like Ray McGovern and others I've talked to who work, you know, with the CIA as analysts, they say it runs from bad to worse.
[00:45:35.214 --> 00:45:36.415]  Okay, sir, those are my questions.
[00:45:36.415 --> 00:45:37.496]  Those two questions.
[00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:52.286]  The first answer is I will not quote any of my sources in my extensive experience as a member of the Association of Foreign Intelligence Officers, the National Military Intelligence Association, and my extensive experience in dealing with Iran with terrorists.
[00:45:52.606 --> 00:45:55.547]  And incompetent civilians, you are absolutely right.
[00:45:55.547 --> 00:46:02.689]  We are creating a false flag situation where Israel will go forth to attack Iran.
[00:46:02.689 --> 00:46:06.751]  What will happen in turn is Iran will not touch the United States.
[00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:08.631]  It never has and it never will.
[00:46:08.631 --> 00:46:19.475]  Iran is very effective at putting a pressure, number one, on Hezbollah, on Israel, and two, on Hamas, and affect Israel's northern border.
[00:46:20.095 --> 00:46:22.358]  It's Eastern border and it's Southern border.
[00:46:22.358 --> 00:46:32.249]  In effect what Israel is doing is approaching Armageddon where it's continuing its self-destructive behavior both militarily and civilian.
[00:46:32.249 --> 00:46:34.552]  I asked the Israeli ex-commanders
[00:46:35.072 --> 00:46:35.353]  I think?
[00:46:51.432 --> 00:46:52.672]  Egypt will be there.
[00:46:52.672 --> 00:46:56.113]  Syria will maintain its low-intensity conflict.
[00:46:56.113 --> 00:47:03.736]  But Iran will exact a huge amount of problems for Israel, and Israel knows that.
[00:47:03.736 --> 00:47:05.536]  And Israel cannot handle that.
[00:47:05.536 --> 00:47:09.617]  The IDF cannot handle three borders which will be exposed.
[00:47:09.617 --> 00:47:18.400]  It cannot handle both Hezbollah on the north, Hamas on the south, and the Jordanian border, which is extremely, extremely vulnerable.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:29.985]  And at the same time, the Middle East will erupt in violence because Bahrain is the area where our military and the surrogates are effectively fighting Iran.
[00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:33.067]  But Iran will not be involved in domestic terrorism.
[00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:33.827]  They don't need it.
[00:47:33.827 --> 00:47:35.888]  The militia is a very smart man.
[00:47:36.648 --> 00:47:42.951]  I always respect my enemies, and one of the things that's a problem is I do not respect our civilians.
[00:47:42.951 --> 00:47:51.356]  As I have said repeatedly on this show, the American public has to be awakened to the fact we have an incompetent, dangerous president.
[00:47:51.356 --> 00:47:53.477]  I'm not saying Democrat or Republican.
[00:47:53.477 --> 00:47:57.199]  We had it truthfully with Bush Jr.
[00:47:57.199 --> 00:47:59.380]  But this one really is out of control.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.702]  You have Biden, who is totally incompetent, a history of plagiarism.
[00:48:04.242 --> 00:48:09.023]  A history ineffectual with his family as being the National Security Council.
[00:48:09.023 --> 00:48:17.945]  You have a CIA that's totally out of control, and Panetta, who's never had experience in national security and intelligence.
[00:48:17.945 --> 00:48:19.546]  How do we stop the war?
[00:48:19.546 --> 00:48:21.466]  How do we stop this from happening?
[00:48:21.466 --> 00:48:30.248]  The former head of Assad came out two weeks ago and said attacking Iran would be a terrible idea, but Netanyahu wants it politically.
[00:48:30.248 --> 00:48:31.889]  So how do we stop this?
[00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:52.720]  The Israeli people have to go into the streets, there's a million of them, and around the world the civilians must go into the streets to demonstrate that there can be no more wars and that they have to stop the Israelis from attack and from the United States supplying Israel with weapons that are totally irrelevant to the national security of the United States.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:02.049]  I will not quote our generals, but I feel that some of our generals have correctly stated years ago, Israel is a strategic liability.
[00:49:02.049 --> 00:49:03.190]  Let me repeat it again.
[00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:08.075]  This is not just an emotional Republican or Democratic issue.
[00:49:08.075 --> 00:49:12.419]  There is no need for us to have Israel on our southern or eastern flank.
[00:49:12.999 --> 00:49:15.600]  Israel has had its own national security.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.722]  Israel has funded against all its sanctions.
[00:49:19.722 --> 00:49:29.425]  That's why Hillary is lying like a banshee through the Ofer family oil into Iran while at the same time condemning the nuclear program.
[00:49:31.032 --> 00:49:41.740]  He repeatedly manipulated the AIPAC and the Jewish community in the United States and the world to say that it's being persecuted, when in fact it has not been persecuted.
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.122]  Israel has been out of control.
[00:49:44.122 --> 00:49:50.506]  Last year they had 25 operatives trying to kill one operative in Dubai.
[00:49:50.506 --> 00:49:52.788]  Israel is in fact dysfunctional.
[00:49:52.788 --> 00:49:56.611]  The people of Israel have to mobilize into the streets.
[00:49:57.271 --> 00:49:59.413]  We've got to go to break here shortly.
[00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:01.374]  Is there anything you want to say before we go to break?
[00:50:23.456 --> 00:50:24.716]  Alright folks, we'll be right back after this break.
[00:50:24.716 --> 00:50:25.057]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.458 --> 00:51:07.209]  With economic and job-based stress now the leading cause of illness, is your body ready for the hard times ahead?
[00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:16.512]  This is Bill Hyde with a special report on staying healthy in hard times.
[00:51:16.512 --> 00:51:27.581]  According to a new article in the London Telegraph, job stress associated with the economic downturn has now replaced cancer, stroke, heart attack and back problems as the number one reason people miss work.
[00:51:27.581 --> 00:51:30.483]  In fact, it's now being called the black death of our time.
[00:51:30.683 --> 00:51:37.786]  This means taking care of your body could be the single most important thing you do, especially in these hard economic times.
[00:51:37.786 --> 00:51:45.510]  Recently, we've created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing how to make sure your body is ready for the dangerous times we live in.
[00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.711]  You can find the video at longtermgreen.com.

[00:52:00.376 --> 00:52:01.958]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:05.422]  You all know I've worked for years with Steve Shank and eFoods Direct.
[00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:08.006]  I have eFoods for my own emergency food supply.
[00:52:08.006 --> 00:52:11.069]  You know Steve, life is different now for all of us, isn't it?
[00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.870]  Very different.
[00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.375]  People are using this great food to survive the present hurricane season.
[00:52:15.675 --> 00:52:21.817]  And we've already had $40 billion worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts.
[00:52:21.817 --> 00:52:24.078]  And that's just the first eight months of this year.
[00:52:24.078 --> 00:52:28.199]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans.
[00:52:28.199 --> 00:52:31.860]  The huge issue of the greatest depression is on everyone's mind.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:38.222]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses, and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American.
[00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:39.923]  So everyone needs food security.
[00:52:40.083 --> 00:52:43.987]  Folks, this month you will get free shipping on every food order from eFoodsDirect.
[00:52:43.987 --> 00:52:47.230]  That's right, every order gets free shipping starting September 6th.

[00:54:08.018 --> 00:54:10.799]  All right, welcome back, folks, to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:10.799 --> 00:54:12.059]  An extraordinary day.
[00:54:12.059 --> 00:54:17.401]  I'm filling in for Alex, who has been joining us by phone for the last 45 minutes or so.
[00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:25.803]  We're also joined by Dr. Steve Pichenik, who has been giving us an analysis and a breakdown of this just truly extraordinary historical news
[00:54:26.623 --> 00:54:42.789]  Groundbreaking, you need to listen in to what is being said here today, because we are talking about a false flag pretext for war in the Middle East, having now been, as we're saying here, fabricated by the Obama administration.
[00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:46.130]  And continuing with Dr. Pichinik, I have a couple of questions for you.
[00:54:47.471 --> 00:54:52.577]  Number one is the incompetence of this apparent false flag operation.
[00:54:52.577 --> 00:54:55.921]  Doesn't that strike you as a pattern from the Obama administration?
[00:54:55.921 --> 00:55:01.367]  If you remember the incompetence of how they tried to forge the birth certificate, it was obviously a fake.
[00:55:01.367 --> 00:55:04.651]  Well, this is obviously a fake terror plot.
[00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:07.254]  Does that strike you as something characteristic?
[00:55:09.366 --> 00:55:09.847]  I don't know.
[00:55:09.847 --> 00:55:10.287]  I don't know.
[00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.751]  Yes.
[00:55:52.534 --> 00:55:59.216]  As always said, we need a certain kind of genius to control the CIA, and unfortunately we have not had it.
[00:55:59.216 --> 00:56:09.159]  I'm hoping that General Petraeus can put them in line, but you have the DEA, you have the ATF, and these are not functional institutions.
[00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:19.623]  With all due respect to the FBI, they are brilliant domestically, but Mueller has really discredited himself twice, on the 9-11 and today, and this is a war hero.
[00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:23.946]  In Vietnam, and if I were he, I would resign out of just dignity.
[00:56:23.946 --> 00:56:26.208]  Eric Holder should be indicted.
[00:56:26.208 --> 00:56:28.249]  He's totally dysfunctional.
[00:56:28.249 --> 00:56:29.290]  He has lied.
[00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:32.012]  He has committed perjury in front of Congress.
[00:56:32.012 --> 00:56:34.194]  He has lied to the American public.
[00:56:34.194 --> 00:56:46.623]  And now what you have is dysfunctional, the most dysfunctional story of all is the fact that Osama bin Laden, there is no one in the world that believes that Osama bin Laden was killed
[00:56:47.263 --> 00:56:49.184]  And then was dumped into the waters.
[00:56:49.184 --> 00:56:52.345]  I mean, it was so absurd, it became ridiculous.
[00:56:52.345 --> 00:57:01.309]  Even Mueller came forth on this story about the assassination plot, saying it's like a Hollywood movie, as if he was trying to co-opt himself on the truth of the matters.
[00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:06.011]  Mueller, I'm sorry, but you failed once again, and is beyond a Hollywood movie.
[00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:09.272]  No producer in their right mind would have bought this, because it's not true.
[00:57:09.272 --> 00:57:11.093]  It has no consistency.
[00:57:11.093 --> 00:57:12.353]  It's dysfunctional.
[00:57:12.353 --> 00:57:15.935]  And once again, you have operatives who have no idea of how to create
[00:57:16.295 --> 00:57:17.035]  A false flag.
[00:57:36.732 --> 00:57:39.554]  One of them, the fact that he is going to be handed a door.
[00:57:39.554 --> 00:57:48.280]  He should be actually prosecuted for lying in front of Congress, for perjury, for distortion disinformation, for inciting a war.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.724]  I mean, Eric Holder should be held accountable for a lot of malfeasance.
[00:57:53.724 --> 00:57:58.148]  I'm not a lawyer, but I certainly know the miscreant behavior he has had.
[00:57:58.148 --> 00:58:03.932]  It's not only his heat, but you have a president who has not performed, who has not been able to create jobs.
[00:58:04.332 --> 00:58:08.394]  Who has polarized the country and it basically has very low ratings.
[00:58:08.394 --> 00:58:15.057]  The only way presidents historically in the United States have created is increased ratings.
[00:58:15.057 --> 00:58:16.238]  And this one is pitiful.
[00:58:16.238 --> 00:58:19.479]  Alright, Dr. Pachinik, we are just about out of time here.
[00:58:19.479 --> 00:58:20.840]  I apologize for cutting you off.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.181]  We're out of time for this segment.
[00:58:23.181 --> 00:58:24.961]  I want to thank you for joining us.

[00:58:29.863 --> 00:58:38.185]  Also, here on the Alex Jones Show, we're going to continue to break this down and have additional analysis.
[00:58:38.185 --> 00:58:42.927]  Stay with us.

[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:02.564]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.564 --> 00:59:11.291]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:15.355]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:15.355 --> 00:59:17.296]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:31.563]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:31.563 --> 00:59:33.364]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.364 --> 00:59:36.245]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.245 --> 00:59:40.466]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:59:45.568 --> 00:59:47.148]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:47.148 --> 00:59:47.929]  Got it.
[00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:48.809]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.681]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.681 --> 01:00:02.965]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.965 --> 01:00:04.266]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.266 --> 01:00:06.047]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.047 --> 01:00:07.848]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.848 --> 01:00:09.389]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.389 --> 01:00:10.929]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.929 --> 01:00:15.132]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.132 --> 01:00:19.174]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.475 --> 01:00:22.698]  Welcome back, friends, to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.698 --> 01:00:24.921]  I'm the fill-in host for today, Mike Adams.
[01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:36.276]  Alex just joined us for much of the last hour, and we have been breaking down just an explosive story, probably the biggest breaking news in the country, maybe in the world, happening today.
[01:00:36.936 --> 01:00:40.459]  And you're getting the inside scoop on it right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:40.459 --> 01:00:41.580]  Thanks to Alex himself.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:50.468]  Thanks to Paul Joseph Watson who has, who joined us in the last hour and is working on another story that will be posted at the top of this hour.
[01:00:50.468 --> 01:00:52.890]  In other words, just about an hour from now.
[01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:58.054]  We intend to have Paul Watson back on here to give us further analysis of the situation.
[01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:02.738]  And also Dr. Steve Pichenik joined us, as you just heard, if you were with us in the last segment.
[01:01:03.539 --> 01:01:07.804]  We have a false flag pretext for war.
[01:01:07.804 --> 01:01:09.565]  War in the Middle East.
[01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:12.609]  This is now being uncovered.
[01:01:12.609 --> 01:01:19.136]  This false flag operation having been formulated apparently by the Obama administration.
[01:01:19.136 --> 01:01:23.660]  We don't know exactly which operatives inside it, but as Dr. Pachinik alluded to,
[01:01:24.261 --> 01:01:24.441]  I think?
[01:01:46.718 --> 01:01:47.018]  I think so.
[01:02:08.217 --> 01:02:12.699]  So we are going to be talking to them, but we will be coming back to this story.
[01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:20.722]  And if there's any breaking news that happens in the next two hours, we will go right to it immediately, interrupting any guests who may be joining us.
[01:02:20.722 --> 01:02:25.304]  So if you are listening to this right now, don't turn your dial.
[01:02:25.304 --> 01:02:36.169]  You're going to get the best breaking news right here today on this extraordinary situation, which involved a false flag plot to have a used car salesman in Texas
[01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:45.732]  Apparently tried to assassinate a Saudi ambassador in the United States as a pretext for war.
[01:02:45.732 --> 01:02:55.874]  Again, Israel, according to Alex here, as he explained earlier, Israel may be just weeks away from launching a war, launching an attack on Iran.
[01:02:55.874 --> 01:03:04.497]  And this attempted assassination attempt, which is being described by the mainstream media as a real thing, but we believe is a false flag attack,
[01:03:05.257 --> 01:03:09.720]  Maybe the pretext for justification of all of that.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.983]  Now there's a lot more, let's say aftermath to this that you need to know about.
[01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:22.631]  And we're going to be analyzing that and giving you some information about what you can expect to happen if an attack is launched on Iran.
[01:03:22.631 --> 01:03:24.731]  What's going to happen to oil prices?
[01:03:24.731 --> 01:03:26.831]  What's going to happen to gold prices?
[01:03:26.831 --> 01:03:38.934]  What's going to happen in the presidential elections in the United States if Obama is positioned up as a war hero in much the same way that former President George W. Bush was positioned in the aftermath of 9-11?
[01:03:40.114 --> 01:03:43.155]  There are some very serious implications to all of this.
[01:03:43.155 --> 01:03:54.279]  Our world, as of today, because of this apparent false flag setup, is headed for war, a major global war, and we need to take action to prevent it.
[01:03:54.279 --> 01:03:58.301]  We've got to stop us from devolving into a world
[01:03:58.641 --> 01:04:05.324]  They can only resort to killing people in order for governments to gain power and control their own populations.
[01:04:05.324 --> 01:04:06.724]  We've got to resist this.
[01:04:06.724 --> 01:04:09.145]  We've got to get the word out that we know about this.
[01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:10.446]  We know what's going on.
[01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:15.427]  And we've got to take action so that people can protest this, even in Israel.
[01:04:15.427 --> 01:04:24.671]  As Dr. Pachinic said in the last segment, the Israeli people need to take to the streets and demand peace, demand that they do not start another war, which can only end
[01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:36.486]  In suffering, which can only end in death for people on both sides, no matter who you side with in this war, dropping bombs and causing death is not a positive outcome for our world.
[01:04:36.486 --> 01:04:38.849]  So stay with us right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:43.315]  We'll be breaking this down with a lot more details when we return right after this break.
[01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:02.565]  Public police action.
[01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.826]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:03.826 --> 01:05:07.748]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:07.748 --> 01:05:09.990]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:15.854]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:15.854 --> 01:05:22.098]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:28.463]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:28.463 --> 01:05:32.687]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:36.971]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:42.916]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:46.479]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:46.479 --> 01:05:48.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:48.881]  It's here.

[01:06:00.782 --> 01:06:13.074]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[01:06:13.074 --> 01:06:20.241]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:24.565]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:06:24.565 --> 01:06:26.906]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:06:26.906 --> 01:06:31.751]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:32.311]  A $259 value for only $1.99.

[01:06:33.472 --> 01:06:34.913]  Call 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:06:45.442 --> 01:06:46.403]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:51.347]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:51.347 --> 01:06:54.010]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:08.823 --> 01:07:14.185]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:14.185 --> 01:07:17.247]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:17.247 --> 01:07:19.548]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:19.548 --> 01:07:25.791]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:26.231]  In fact,
[01:07:26.511 --> 01:07:29.173]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:29.173 --> 01:07:34.957]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:34.957 --> 01:07:36.598]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:37.899]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:37.899 --> 01:07:40.561]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:40.561 --> 01:07:44.804]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:44.804 --> 01:07:47.426]  You can find the video at www.barron.com.
[01:07:47.586 --> 01:07:49.407]  End of America 3 dot com.
[01:07:49.407 --> 01:07:51.987]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.
[01:07:51.987 --> 01:07:55.869]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:55.869 --> 01:07:59.370]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.151]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:02.151 --> 01:08:04.971]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:24.538]  Alright friends, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:27.940]  I'm the fill-in host, Mike Adams, the editor of Natural News.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:36.563]  And today, as you've heard, we have been exploring just an extraordinary breaking news story on the potential false flag attack.
[01:08:36.563 --> 01:08:39.725]  Well, I would say the obvious false flag pretext.
[01:08:40.665 --> 01:08:43.327]  For an attack in the Middle East.
[01:08:43.327 --> 01:08:46.890]  So we're going to continue to cover this story here for the next two hours.
[01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.111]  We do have other guests lined up.
[01:08:48.111 --> 01:09:06.864]  In fact, we're going to be talking to Leslie Botha from SaneVax, who's going to give us some information about Governor Jerry Brown's decision in California that allows 12-year-old children to give consent to being injected with a vaccine that could kill them.
[01:09:07.785 --> 01:09:11.367]  That's another bit of insanity happening in our world today and we're going to cover that.
[01:09:11.367 --> 01:09:18.170]  We also have coming up Mark Castell from the Cornucopia Institute at the top of the next hour.
[01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:25.913]  He's going to talk to us about GMOs having been detected in so-called natural cereal products, breakfast cereals.
[01:09:25.913 --> 01:09:27.914]  So we have a lot of news lined up for you.
[01:09:27.914 --> 01:09:35.518]  Also Paul Joseph Watson will likely be joining us in a little under an hour to give us some more breaking news on the
[01:09:36.718 --> 01:09:43.164]  Iranian false flag assassination attempt on the Saudi ambassador to the United States.
[01:09:43.164 --> 01:09:45.626]  And I want to thank Paul Watson for his story.
[01:09:45.626 --> 01:09:59.379]  If you haven't read it yet, get yourself on to Infowars.com and read that article because this is probably the biggest news that you have heard certainly all week, maybe the biggest story of the year.
[01:09:59.379 --> 01:10:02.021]  And it's breaking right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:13.722]  I have a lot of questions about that situation, too, so I'd like to get Watson on the phone and ask him a few things, too, Jaron, if you can set that up towards the end of this hour.
[01:10:13.722 --> 01:10:21.903]  Now, getting to who we have joining us right now is Leslie Botha from the SaneVax, Inc.
[01:10:21.903 --> 01:10:30.705]  organization, which has done extraordinary work on exposing, for example, the contamination of HPV vaccines.
[01:10:31.545 --> 01:10:38.368]  With the rDNA, the recombinant DNA of various strains of HPV itself.
[01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:40.069]  And that should not be in the DNA.
[01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:50.694]  And you learned about that here on the Alex Jones Show when Dr. Andrew Wakefield joined us and also when Leslie, when you saw her articles posted on both Natural News and InfoWars.com as well.
[01:10:51.434 --> 01:11:05.704]  She joins us now to talk about the recent decision in California, I should say, the signing of the law by Governor Jerry Brown in California that gives children the right, the right to consent to something that could kill them.
[01:11:05.704 --> 01:11:07.986]  Leslie, are you with us on the phone?
[01:11:07.986 --> 01:11:11.228]  I am so glad to be talking about this issue.
[01:11:11.228 --> 01:11:11.829]  Absolutely.
[01:11:11.829 --> 01:11:14.951]  Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[01:11:14.951 --> 01:11:18.934]  Governor Jerry Brown's decision certainly shocked all of us.
[01:11:19.594 --> 01:11:20.355]  We're good to go.
[01:11:40.986 --> 01:12:02.791]  Well, let's break it down though, what exactly this law allows, because as I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, a child could come home from school having a vaccine shot and could say, hey mommy, I got a vaccine shot today and here's my permission note which I signed myself and the school said I could.
[01:12:04.062 --> 01:12:17.735]  Or a child can come home from school, like happened up to Linda Moran, a child came home from school, never told her mother she had the vaccine, went in to take a bath, and never came out of the bathtub.
[01:12:17.735 --> 01:12:19.036]  Because she died.
[01:12:19.036 --> 01:12:19.737]  Because she died.
[01:12:20.445 --> 01:12:21.086]  Absolutely.
[01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:28.491]  I had another young woman named Courtney on my own radio show about a month ago talking about this.
[01:12:28.491 --> 01:12:32.474]  At 15, Courtney and her mother went to a doctor's office in California.
[01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:38.578]  Her gynecologist, female gynecologist, who said Gardasil, they said no.
[01:12:38.578 --> 01:12:42.581]  The gynecologist said, can I speak to your daughter alone, please?
[01:12:42.581 --> 01:12:48.385]  Pulled the daughter aside into her office and said, you know, I can give you this vaccine without your mother knowing it.
[01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:49.879]  Incredible.
[01:12:59.099 --> 01:13:11.086]  The gynecologist, visibly upset, marched out to the mother and said, I want you to know that if your daughter gets raped, she's going to get cervical cancer and die because you did not let her get this vaccine.
[01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:11.526]  Unbelievable!
[01:13:11.526 --> 01:13:14.688]  The evidence is farther than the truth!
[01:13:14.688 --> 01:13:15.468]  Absolutely!
[01:13:15.468 --> 01:13:21.132]  But let's really look at this issue, and I know I was reading your commentaries on 8499 this morning.
[01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:25.660]  And you've done a great job.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.891]  Total California cave into the criminal vaccine industry.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.001]  But why would Governor Jerry Brown, why would he sign this?
[01:13:34.001 --> 01:13:38.502]  I mean, who convinced him or who got to him?
[01:13:38.502 --> 01:13:52.725]  Why would, I mean, I don't think in his heart that he wants to be an evil person and yet this act can very easily be interpreted as a crime against humanity because of the number of children that are going to be maimed and killed by this.
[01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:53.685]  Why would he do this?
[01:13:54.344 --> 01:13:56.865]  Or is it really an act?
[01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:59.667]  Well, it is an act against humanity, yes.
[01:13:59.667 --> 01:14:14.194]  However, if he did not sign this bill, Gardasil would not be in the news again this week, I wouldn't be on the Alex Jones Show, I wouldn't be on Robert Scott Bell's show, and I wouldn't be on a radio station out of New York tonight talking about this issue.
[01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:16.376]  Let's look at it this way.
[01:14:18.294 --> 01:14:23.097]  You know, let's tie it in with what Michelle Bachman did, alright, a month ago.
[01:14:23.097 --> 01:14:24.398]  Right, with Perry.
[01:14:24.398 --> 01:14:25.940]  At the Republican debate.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:31.403]  She shocked everybody when she brought up Gardasil and said, I wouldn't get this vaccine for my kids.
[01:14:31.403 --> 01:14:33.685]  For her daughters.
[01:14:33.685 --> 01:14:37.067]  And calling it a potentially dangerous vaccine.
[01:14:37.067 --> 01:14:41.611]  What if Governor Jerry Brown, who I happen to be a fan of,
[01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:48.233]  For the first time he was governor back in the 70s and thought he did a great job and stood up for the people.
[01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:58.421]  What if Governor Jerry Brown was under so much pressure by his state legislature, by the pharmaceutical companies who we know lobby the heck out of everybody.
[01:14:58.421 --> 01:14:59.783]  Sure.
[01:14:59.783 --> 01:15:03.506]  And signed this bill to bring attention to what is going on.
[01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:06.358]  You're not going to run for president.
[01:15:06.358 --> 01:15:09.179]  You even said that in your comments.
[01:15:09.179 --> 01:15:14.520]  This is the closing chapter of his political career, almost certainly.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.721]  And what a very long political career as well.
[01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:25.342]  But are you suggesting that he did this on purpose to show how ridiculous it is so that there would be some public discussion?
[01:15:25.342 --> 01:15:32.444]  This public outcry, this backlash before a farmer goes in and buys up every state in the country trying to do the same thing.
[01:15:33.448 --> 01:15:35.509]  Yeah, I am suggesting that.
[01:15:35.509 --> 01:15:39.830]  And I think we need to get to Governor Jerry Brown's office and find out why.
[01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:50.715]  Well, if this is the reason, I'm sorry to interrupt, but if this is the reason he did it and if he comes out and goes public with that, then I owe him an apology because I had some very critical things to say about him for signing this.
[01:15:50.715 --> 01:15:51.455]  What's your take?
[01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:55.124]  Well, I mean, I could be wrong.
[01:15:55.124 --> 01:15:59.668]  I've been wrong once already today and I'll probably be wrong by the end of the day.
[01:15:59.668 --> 01:16:05.033]  But I'm just saying, nothing has... You know, we're all so quick to jump and to condemn, alright?
[01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:12.921]  And there is a lot to condemn here if indeed he succumbed to lobbying pressure and Merck pressure and did this.
[01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:28.432]  But if he wanted to show how crazy this is, wouldn't it have been better to just call a press release and have all the press around and announce that I'm not going to sign this bill because Big Pharma keeps pressuring us and these vaccines are not safe for children?
[01:16:28.432 --> 01:16:32.295]  Wouldn't that have been more effective than passing it and waiting for the backlash?
[01:16:32.295 --> 01:16:36.498]  Well, it would have been yesterday's news tomorrow.
[01:16:36.498 --> 01:16:39.381]  Everybody loves negative media.
[01:16:40.547 --> 01:16:44.389]  Um, and maybe you're right and maybe I am wrong, but we don't know.
[01:16:44.389 --> 01:16:45.090]  Yeah, we don't know.
[01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:46.571]  And that's the issue here.
[01:16:46.571 --> 01:16:54.355]  But here's, this is a big issue, because it does set a dangerous precedent, alright?
[01:16:54.355 --> 01:17:04.502]  So whatever the politics behind it, it sets a very dangerous precedent of parents losing control over their children or healthcare, certain aspects of healthcare.
[01:17:05.462 --> 01:17:16.853]  It's STDs, it's vaccines, and STD vaccines, which there are more and more coming down the pike, and also for mental health diagnosis and SSRIs.
[01:17:16.853 --> 01:17:18.014]  Holy smokes!
[01:17:18.322 --> 01:17:29.646]  Well, right, and now with this precedent, as you just mentioned, the state overrides the parents, not just their rights, but even their knowledge of it.
[01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:43.231]  The state can now round up children in school and run these propaganda campaigns, and it's very easy to twist the mind of a 12-year-old child in the sense of social engineering in the context of a classroom.
[01:17:43.231 --> 01:17:45.172]  They can inject them with who knows what.
[01:17:45.172 --> 01:17:45.812]  They can put them on
[01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:50.314]  Preventive chemotherapy for preventing future breast cancer.
[01:17:50.314 --> 01:17:54.176]  I mean, your little girl could come home from school with chemotherapy.
[01:17:54.176 --> 01:17:55.336]  Absolutely.
[01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:56.357]  Absolutely.
[01:17:56.357 --> 01:18:04.000]  But what better way to light a fire under parents than to set a bill in motion that takes away their rights.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.101]  Because we are a very complacent society.
[01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:10.883]  Leslie, by the way, what's your website address for those who want to follow your coverage of this?
[01:18:12.339 --> 01:18:30.917]  Well, there's SaneVax.org and I have my own website on HolyHormones.com which is all about women's health and you know really there is a big picture here that is why we are in such a mess and that is because we do not have adequate information for young girls about health care,
[01:18:32.383 --> 01:18:34.265]  And that is the crime.
[01:18:34.265 --> 01:18:36.567]  They don't understand their bodies.
[01:18:36.567 --> 01:18:39.830]  They're being put on birth control pills at alarming rates.
[01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:44.193]  They're being given Gardasil at alarming rates.
[01:18:44.193 --> 01:18:45.694]  And it's killing them.
[01:18:45.694 --> 01:18:52.400]  I mean, the whole social-political issue surrounding women's health care is all about money and profit.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.360]  Of course it is.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:53.720]  Of course.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:19:10.025]  And this is also all about parents versus the state, because I think you would agree with me that even if Gardasil were proven 100% safe, which it hasn't been proven, but even if it were, we would still want parents to have the rights to choose what gets injected into their children, correct?
[01:19:10.025 --> 01:19:12.546]  And that is absolutely correct.
[01:19:12.546 --> 01:19:13.426]  At all times.
[01:19:14.045 --> 01:19:14.606]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:30.645 --> 01:19:32.047]  Leslie, we're about to go to a break.
[01:19:32.047 --> 01:19:36.611]  I'd like to ask you to stay with us and join us again on the other side of this break.
[01:19:36.611 --> 01:19:38.573]  If you're listening, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.255]  I'm the fill-in host, Mike Adams.
[01:19:40.255 --> 01:19:40.755]  Stay with us.
[01:19:40.755 --> 01:19:45.060]  We'll be right back after this short break with more from Leslie and Sain Vax.
[01:19:58.587 --> 01:20:01.969]  Why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today?
[01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:03.929]  Why don't doctors know how to help you?
[01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:09.472]  Could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution and they only know about drugs?
[01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:13.253]  Over 68 diseases are connected to a deficiency of glutathione.
[01:20:13.253 --> 01:20:17.715]  The missing ingredient to increasing your body's production of glutathione is cysteine.
[01:20:17.715 --> 01:20:27.900]  Raising your glutathione production protects you from cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS,
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:28.920]  We're good to go!

[01:22:11.353 --> 01:22:12.434]  No one can deny.
[01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:23.340]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:28.342]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.

[01:24:13.539 --> 01:24:16.161]  All right, you are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:16.161 --> 01:24:40.375]  I am the fill-in host today, Mike Adams, the editor of Natural News, and we are joined in this segment, continuing with Leslie Botha from Sane Vax, Inc., talking about Jerry Brown, Governor Jerry Brown's signature in California of Bill AB-499, which allows children to give consent, children as young as 12 years old, if you can believe that, to give consent to being injected with
[01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:44.661]  Potentially deadly vaccines, even without their parents knowing about it.
[01:24:44.661 --> 01:24:55.977]  And at the same time, by the way, Governor Brown signed another bill that says, oh, you can't go to a tanning salon if you're under 18 without a note from your parents or actually parental escort almost.
[01:24:57.018 --> 01:24:58.138]  You can't even go to the zoo.
[01:24:58.138 --> 01:25:02.859]  You can't go to a field trip museum without a note from your parents.
[01:25:02.859 --> 01:25:14.142]  But now, if you're 12 years old, if you're 13, you can say yes to a vaccine that we know has killed children, a vaccine that maims some children, a vaccine with neurological side effects.
[01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.942]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:25:16.942 --> 01:25:21.563]  And here to give us a little more information on that is Leslie from SaneVax, Inc.
[01:25:21.563 --> 01:25:24.384]  And that website is SaneVax.org.
[01:25:24.384 --> 01:25:25.184]  Is that correct, Leslie?
[01:25:25.184 --> 01:25:26.304]  That is correct.
[01:25:27.084 --> 01:25:36.569]  The whole thing does sound ludicrous.
[01:25:36.569 --> 01:25:40.611]  I mean, Governor Brown usually protects family rights.
[01:25:40.611 --> 01:25:42.231]  Parental rights.
[01:25:42.231 --> 01:25:44.352]  He's been known to do that over the years.
[01:25:44.352 --> 01:25:45.573]  He stands up for the people.
[01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:46.653]  He stands up for the family.
[01:25:46.653 --> 01:25:51.736]  And that's why, if this is anybody else but Governor Brown, I'd be going
[01:25:52.873 --> 01:25:54.294]  Bastard!
[01:25:54.294 --> 01:25:57.576]  But with Governor Brown, it just doesn't make sense.
[01:25:57.576 --> 01:26:12.825]  And then, as I said before, in light of Michelle Bachmann and what she did and the risk that she took in losing points and losing credibility for coming out and speaking about Gardasil during the Republican debate.
[01:26:12.825 --> 01:26:20.030]  And you sort of look at those back and forth and you go, maybe we're having more of an impact
[01:26:20.788 --> 01:26:21.829]  Well, it's extraordinary!
[01:26:39.597 --> 01:26:39.917]  I think so.
[01:26:54.756 --> 01:27:01.318]  Senate, governors, universities, you know we're watching all these people hitting on our website.
[01:27:01.318 --> 01:27:03.219]  So is it really that absurd?
[01:27:03.219 --> 01:27:06.660]  You know, we are having this impact.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:16.443]  Your work and the work of Alex here at his show and InfoWars, Paul Watson, what we're doing at Natural News, many like Sherry Tenpenny that you mentioned.
[01:27:16.443 --> 01:27:20.764]  We are all having an impact and we are shaping the conversations out there.
[01:27:20.764 --> 01:27:22.785]  Kudos to Michelle Bachman for raising
[01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:30.649]  Absolutely she did and she knew she was going to be at great risk for doing so and she dropped immediately to the bottom of the barrel.
[01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:33.851]  But she did it and she spoke as a mother and she was honest about it and
[01:27:43.411 --> 01:27:48.653]  That's why I have to question, really, and I can't condemn Jerry Brown until we know it.
[01:27:48.653 --> 01:27:51.654]  That would be a great interview for you, or somebody out there.
[01:27:51.654 --> 01:27:53.434]  Let's get to Jerry Brown's office.
[01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.395]  Well, I already condemned Jerry Brown.
[01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:57.276]  Maybe it's too late for me.
[01:27:57.276 --> 01:27:59.436]  But look, hey, I'll retract it.
[01:27:59.436 --> 01:28:09.040]  I mean, I'll apologize to the guy if it turns out that this was some kind of weird behind-the-scenes plot to actually expose the dangers of vaccines.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.721]  That seems like a stretch to me, but you may be right.
[01:28:12.941 --> 01:28:13.681]  We'll see what happens.
[01:28:13.681 --> 01:28:15.502]  We're in the media.
[01:28:15.502 --> 01:28:16.963]  Gardashow is in the media.
[01:28:16.963 --> 01:28:19.604]  Merck's marketing department has to be dying.
[01:28:19.604 --> 01:28:22.085]  There is no more damage control for them.
[01:28:22.085 --> 01:28:23.846]  This thing is a train wreck.
[01:28:23.846 --> 01:28:25.947]  It's a train running out of control.
[01:28:25.947 --> 01:28:28.188]  And it's going to gain more momentum as we go.
[01:28:28.188 --> 01:28:30.849]  And we couldn't have done this without Michelle Bachmann.
[01:28:30.849 --> 01:28:36.011]  And we couldn't have done it without Governor Jerry Brown signing this bill.
[01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:50.651]  Well, what an extraordinary roll call of players in the stage of world events just on the vaccine front, not to even mention what's going on today with Iran and Saudi Arabia and Israel and all that.
[01:28:50.651 --> 01:28:52.151]  We're just about out of time here, Leslie.
[01:28:52.151 --> 01:28:53.832]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:28:53.832 --> 01:28:55.632]  I'm sorry it's a short segment for you today.
[01:28:55.632 --> 01:29:00.193]  We did plan to have you on for longer, but we've got all this other breaking news happening at the same time.
[01:29:00.193 --> 01:29:02.374]  So I do want to thank you for joining us and for your comments.
[01:29:02.634 --> 01:29:03.414]  Thank you, Mike, very much.
[01:29:26.443 --> 01:29:26.963]  All right.
[01:29:26.963 --> 01:29:28.364]  Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there.
[01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:31.745]  Man, just what an incredibly crazy day of news.
[01:29:31.745 --> 01:29:32.225]  Stay with us.
[01:29:32.225 --> 01:29:37.367]  We've got a lot more breaking news on the other side of this break here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:37.367 --> 01:29:47.710]  Stay with us.
[01:29:47.710 --> 01:29:49.091]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.091 --> 01:29:51.632]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.632 --> 01:29:54.293]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.614 --> 01:30:04.300]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:10.727]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:30:10.727 --> 01:30:13.010]  Number one, study the past.
[01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:15.413]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:30:15.413 --> 01:30:19.137]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:30:20.242 --> 01:30:23.345]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:30:23.345 --> 01:30:27.168]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:30:27.168 --> 01:30:32.232]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:30:32.232 --> 01:30:35.635]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:30:36.215 --> 01:30:39.636]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:30:39.636 --> 01:30:44.118]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:44.118 --> 01:30:49.060]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:53.682]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:53.682 --> 01:30:55.863]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:59.105 --> 01:31:03.129]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:03.129 --> 01:31:06.373]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:06.373 --> 01:31:11.178]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:11.178 --> 01:31:17.564]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:17.564 --> 01:31:19.807]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:20.327 --> 01:31:20.627]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:20.627 --> 01:31:20.807]  Bernanke?
[01:31:20.807 --> 01:31:21.167]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:21.167 --> 01:31:21.867]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:21.867 --> 01:31:23.548]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:39.232 --> 01:31:41.373]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:41.373 --> 01:31:46.517]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:46.517 --> 01:31:55.642]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:59.656 --> 01:32:03.597]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:03.597 --> 01:32:12.459]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:12.459 --> 01:32:17.080]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:27.902]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:38.044]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:38.044 --> 01:32:43.486]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:43.486 --> 01:32:50.967]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:50.967 --> 01:32:53.728]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:13.083]  Okay, folks, we are back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.083 --> 01:33:14.524]  I'm the fill-in host today, Mike Adams.
[01:33:14.524 --> 01:33:27.855]  We're going to be joined shortly by Paul Joseph Watson, who is working feverishly on a breaking story to be posted on InfoWars.com, probably, maybe within half an hour, I guess he'll tell us exactly when.
[01:33:27.855 --> 01:33:33.059]  Before we bring Paul Watson in, I just want to cover a couple of things here on this issue.
[01:33:33.059 --> 01:33:37.922]  This breaking news today, this is the biggest news story happening probably
[01:33:38.763 --> 01:33:44.688]  Probably on the planet today because we're talking about a false flag pretext for war in the Middle East.
[01:33:44.688 --> 01:34:02.422]  The Obama administration now practically being caught just fudging a false flag attempted assassination plot against a Saudi ambassador in the United States involving an Iranian used car salesman from Texas.
[01:34:03.143 --> 01:34:11.585]  Who has been just probably another patsy set up by perhaps the FBI, perhaps the CIA, certain rogue elements within those agencies.
[01:34:11.585 --> 01:34:14.406]  I'm going to ask Paul Watson more about that.
[01:34:14.406 --> 01:34:20.347]  But let's go to the mainstream media very quickly and see how they are beating the drums for war.
[01:34:20.347 --> 01:34:22.968]  Beating the war drums, the Washington Post.
[01:34:22.968 --> 01:34:28.709]  Obama blames Iran government for role in assassination plot against Saudi diplomat.
[01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:30.529]  Wow, how convenient is that?
[01:34:30.529 --> 01:34:32.230]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:34.471]  From the Obama administration.
[01:34:34.471 --> 01:34:43.815]  A former Netanyahu advisor says, time for the US to strike Iran.
[01:34:43.815 --> 01:34:45.936]  Very convenient pretext there.
[01:34:45.936 --> 01:34:50.658]  Daily News says, Iran's terror plot marks the end of engagement.
[01:34:50.658 --> 01:34:54.460]  It's time for Washington to get tough with Tehran.
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:54.900]  Oh really?
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.581]  Time to get tough because of this?
[01:34:56.581 --> 01:35:00.463]  Because of this just juvenile assassination plot?
[01:35:00.463 --> 01:35:00.703]  Really?
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.240]  I don't know.
[01:35:21.509 --> 01:35:24.331]  Here's something from CBS News.
[01:35:24.331 --> 01:35:25.452]  Very interesting.
[01:35:25.452 --> 01:35:33.758]  It leads off with, quote, the alleged plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States was comically amateurish.
[01:35:33.758 --> 01:35:35.659]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:35:35.659 --> 01:35:46.327]  But the US government believes not only that it was approved at high levels in Tehran, but also that it was not the only plot from CBS News correspondent Bill Plante.
[01:35:47.688 --> 01:35:53.818]  We're going to bring in Paul Joseph Watson, who has already reported on this and is going to be posting another story.
[01:35:53.818 --> 01:35:56.482]  Paul Watson, are you with us now?
[01:35:56.482 --> 01:35:59.427]  Are you with us via Skype?
[01:35:59.427 --> 01:36:00.469]  Hello, Mike.
[01:36:00.469 --> 01:36:01.230]  Hello, Paul.
[01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:01.971]  Great to hear from you.
[01:36:03.816 --> 01:36:19.227]  Basically, what's happening is that Defence Secretary Leon Panetta visited Tel Aviv back on October 3rd, and it appears as if the Israelis basically told him, look, we've got a two-month window for this strike on Iran.
[01:36:19.227 --> 01:36:25.971]  We've got to get it done before winter, because if we wait, then it's going to make it a whole lot more difficult.
[01:36:25.971 --> 01:36:27.893]  And the debate apparently has been on
[01:36:29.249 --> 01:36:35.313]  How the United States would give the green light for this Israeli assault on Iran.
[01:36:35.313 --> 01:36:55.466]  So lo and behold, less than two weeks later, we have this ridiculous fantasy hoax of a terror plot, which it now turns out, the so-called mastermind behind it, this used car salesman, turns out to be a drunk, pothead, hooker-frequenting, quote, joke.
[01:36:55.466 --> 01:36:56.986]  That's how he's being described.
[01:36:57.887 --> 01:37:08.613]  But now this fake plot is being aggressively exploited from everyone from, you know, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, to John McCain.
[01:37:08.613 --> 01:37:19.418]  And it's interesting because back in February last year, we wrote that it would be an assassination attempt that would be used as the pretext to go into Iran.
[01:37:19.418 --> 01:37:22.480]  Now we speculated that it might be Obama as the target.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:28.485]  It actually turns out that Obama is now being pressured by the neocons.
[01:37:28.485 --> 01:37:39.455]  He's being blackmailed into this attack because they're saying this is the only way to get tough, to save your presidency, is to green light this attack on Iran.
[01:37:39.455 --> 01:37:46.362]  So, you know, ten days after Panetta visits Tel Aviv, the Israelis basically tell him, look, this is what's going to happen.
[01:37:46.362 --> 01:37:47.683]  You'd better get on board with it.
[01:37:48.624 --> 01:37:59.988]  And then ten days later we have this ridiculous fake terror plot which is Anthony Schaeffer, Lieutenant Colonel, told Andrew Napolitano last night on Fox Business, is a complete myth.
[01:37:59.988 --> 01:38:04.649]  There's no evidence to detail it within the FBI channels.
[01:38:04.649 --> 01:38:14.632]  Schaeffer had an FBI insider, an FBI investigator, look to see if he could find any details regarding this alleged plot and he found absolutely nothing.
[01:38:15.032 --> 01:38:25.236]  It's being completely manufactured out of whole cloth and now it's being used as the pretext to green light this planned, pre-planned Israeli assault on Iran.
[01:38:25.236 --> 01:38:36.221]  But Paul, importantly on this, and an outstanding analysis you've offered us already, and I know more coming from you today with new stories to be posted on Infowars.com, but the question is,
[01:38:37.774 --> 01:38:41.037]  Is the mainstream media going to continue to buy it?
[01:38:41.037 --> 01:38:46.361]  And will the people of America buy into this, even though it is now an obvious hoax?
[01:38:46.361 --> 01:38:49.924]  I mean, we've got some media outlets are questioning it.
[01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.405]  Others are buying into it.
[01:38:51.405 --> 01:39:02.294]  Where do you see this playing out across the mainstream media and then in the minds of the American people?
[01:39:02.294 --> 01:39:03.355]  Were you able to hear me there, Paul?
[01:39:05.014 --> 01:39:08.137]  Yeah, it's just cutting out a bit, but yeah, I got the gist of what you were saying.
[01:39:08.137 --> 01:39:27.614]  Yeah, the Washington Post, the New York Times and others have come out with articles admitting that most foreign observers and terror experts doubt the credence of this plot, but then in the rest of the article they'll go on to detail the frivolous, you know, storyboard, the myth behind it.
[01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:33.116]  What they're saying now is that there's a chain of plots that are going to be blamed on Iran.
[01:39:33.116 --> 01:39:35.257]  So this is only going to escalate.
[01:39:35.257 --> 01:39:41.380]  And now Time Magazine has come out and basically said, look, the response to this is not going to be sanctions.
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:43.561]  It's not going to be isolation of Iran.
[01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:45.182]  It's a pretext for war.
[01:39:45.182 --> 01:39:49.704]  So they're going beyond saying that it's just going to be another tactic to isolate Iran and saying that
[01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:57.028]  That, you know, Obama's going to have to get tough or he's going to be accused of being, quote, soft on Iran.
[01:39:57.028 --> 01:39:59.710]  So that's what the likes of Time Magazine are saying.
[01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:04.974]  So they're going to play this game where Obama gets the right cover from the neocons.
[01:40:04.974 --> 01:40:14.180]  Michelle Bachmann, Romney, they've all come out, all the so-called Tea Party people, and said that, you know, it proves the case that we need to go and attack Iran.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:18.363]  So Obama's got right cover from his supposed political enemies who have all
[01:40:20.484 --> 01:40:30.927]  Paul Watson, does the term CS1 mean anything to you?
[01:40:30.927 --> 01:40:36.028]  CS1 as referring to a paid informant with the Department of Justice.
[01:40:36.028 --> 01:40:38.529]  I'm just getting some breaking news handed to me here.
[01:40:38.529 --> 01:40:40.650]  Is that something you've covered so far?
[01:40:45.336 --> 01:41:08.682]  Yeah, I believe that's the Department of Justice go-between that this joke of a mastermind went and visited and he gave him the orders to create the leisure which they could then exploit to put out this myth in the media that it was a big dangerous assassination plot involving Mexican drug cartels.
[01:41:08.682 --> 01:41:13.764]  Of course, as we documented, those very same Mexican Los Setas gang members
[01:41:14.804 --> 01:41:22.471]  From court transcripts that have come out in recent months, they've been proven to be working directly in cahoots with the federal government itself.
[01:41:22.471 --> 01:41:29.256]  And in fact, many of the weapons from Fast and Furious, the guns went directly to Los Zetas gang members, so...
[01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:47.089]  I mean, from the DEA agent to the Lost Setters, they were all working together and then they find this idiot joke of a guy who's into, you know, smoking pot, getting drunk and frequenting brothels, to be the, quote, mastermind of this plot.
[01:41:47.089 --> 01:41:55.936]  It's completely inconsistent with how Al-Quds, the Iranian Revolutionary Special Tactics Unit works, as every terror expert has said.
[01:41:56.516 --> 01:42:04.383]  They're not going to hire some idiot drunk in America to carry out an assassination plot, and they wouldn't even carry it out in America.
[01:42:04.383 --> 01:42:07.386]  This ambassador is going to be in the Middle East most of the time.
[01:42:07.386 --> 01:42:08.887]  Why not just carry it out there?
[01:42:08.887 --> 01:42:11.490]  Why would you do it in Washington, D.C.?
[01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:15.073]  It's ridiculous, and every expert has said so.
[01:42:15.851 --> 01:42:18.493]  Very good questions from you, Paul Watson.
[01:42:18.493 --> 01:42:20.514]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:42:20.514 --> 01:42:25.658]  I know you've got to go to keep working on the story that you're about to post on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:25.658 --> 01:42:32.743]  Can you give us an idea, when can people expect that story to be live?
[01:42:32.743 --> 01:42:40.509]  Yes, it's a terror hoax could foreshadow Israeli attack on Iran, and it'll be up within half an hour on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:41.246 --> 01:42:42.546]  All right, all right, there you have it then.
[01:42:42.546 --> 01:42:48.489]  Terror hoax story to be posted on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson coming up hopefully within half an hour.
[01:42:48.489 --> 01:42:51.130]  Now, how's that for pressure for Paul Watson?
[01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:52.090]  I bet he's scrambling there.
[01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:57.612]  Thank you for joining us, Paul, for taking time out of your busy journalism schedule there also to get us that story.
[01:42:58.132 --> 01:43:06.415]  Now, some of the breaking news we have on this, and by the way, this is all teleprompter-free radio, just like InfoWars Nightly News is teleprompter-free.
[01:43:06.415 --> 01:43:07.955]  This is all breaking news right now.
[01:43:07.955 --> 01:43:10.276]  This is huge breaking news.
[01:43:10.276 --> 01:43:17.458]  And so, bear with us as we bring in different stories and different guests and different pieces of evidence here.
[01:43:17.458 --> 01:43:25.841]  The latest piece that I'm seeing here is a story entitled, Paid DOJ Agent Provocateur at the Center of
[01:43:26.181 --> 01:43:27.863]  Quote, Iranian terrorist plot.
[01:43:27.863 --> 01:43:32.269]  This was written by Kyle Rogers from the Charleston Political Buzz Examiner.
[01:43:32.269 --> 01:43:38.657]  And in that story, he says, he asked the question, was the assassination plot an actual plot or just entrapment?
[01:43:39.522 --> 01:43:44.384]  Well, that's because the FBI, as we know, goes out there and recruits patsies.
[01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:53.328]  We've seen this pattern emerging just over and over again, where they recruit these people who are largely incompetent, just like what we are seeing here.
[01:43:53.328 --> 01:44:01.352]  And then the FBI actually gives them the gear, gives them, for example, the remote-controlled airplane that was supposed to be flown into the Pentagon.
[01:44:01.972 --> 01:44:08.854]  It gives them the explosives, gives them the firearms and the grenades in that case.
[01:44:08.854 --> 01:44:25.979]  And there are many other cases, other attempted, quote, attempted bombings, attempted terrorist events, where it's on the record now, it's been exposed that the FBI itself, or perhaps, let's say, a rogue element within the FBI, because I don't want to say that all FBI agents are bad.
[01:44:25.979 --> 01:44:27.160]  That's not true.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:31.121]  There are many very good men and women in the FBI who are doing their jobs.
[01:44:31.681 --> 01:44:49.391]  And I want to give them credit, but there are also rogue elements within every agency that appear to be putting together these false flag attacks for the sole purpose of reminding us all, in an Orwellian type of style, that we are always at war and we should always be afraid.
[01:44:50.171 --> 01:44:54.834]  Now in this case, they're amping it up to a whole new level.
[01:44:54.834 --> 01:45:17.507]  With this, what looks like a false flag assassination attempt, they're saying not just be afraid, not just be terrified that there are terrorists running around everywhere, but even more so that, oh now we have the moral justification to go to war, or to allow Israel to bomb Iran,
[01:45:17.927 --> 01:45:31.574]  To allow a key US ally to engage in what's going to be a murderous attack, high fatality rates, no doubt, attack on Iran, which now looks imminent.
[01:45:31.574 --> 01:45:36.317]  As Alex said when he joined us in the last hour, he believes this may happen within two weeks.
[01:45:37.137 --> 01:45:40.938]  You know, certainly give or take some timetable on that.
[01:45:40.938 --> 01:45:46.320]  We don't have a crystal ball around here, but we do see the patterns and we do know history.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:57.284]  And we do know when there's a problem reaction solution being presented to us so that we will react and then allow these administrations to commit what are essentially illegal acts.
[01:45:57.964 --> 01:46:03.527]  And then justify it with these actions that they have fabricated from the get-go.
[01:46:03.527 --> 01:46:09.150]  So I've got some questions about this and some analysis that I want to share with you.
[01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:13.332]  We are, what, five minutes away from a break.
[01:46:13.332 --> 01:46:14.692]  Good, we've got enough time to do this.
[01:46:14.692 --> 01:46:19.855]  And by the way, we are going to be joined at the top of the next hour by Mark Castell.
[01:46:20.515 --> 01:46:33.631]  From the Cornucopia Institute, who's going to be giving us information about how GMOs have been found, detected, verified in laboratories in so-called natural food products, natural cereals.
[01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:38.985]  You know, most people think natural foods are better than everything else.
[01:46:38.985 --> 01:46:44.789]  They think that they have no pesticides and no GMOs, and it turns out that is not exactly the case.
[01:46:44.789 --> 01:46:47.652]  Now, just coming in here on my desk, we have a tip from a listener.
[01:46:47.652 --> 01:46:50.734]  Aaron in Canada, thanks for sending this in.
[01:46:50.734 --> 01:46:52.296]  This is an article.
[01:46:52.296 --> 01:46:58.381]  Canada should arrest George W. Bush when he visits next week, says Amnesty.
[01:46:58.381 --> 01:46:59.762]  Oh, wow, okay.
[01:46:59.762 --> 01:47:00.522]  Bush admitted
[01:47:01.383 --> 01:47:08.929]  In his memoirs, that he authorized the use of torture against terror suspects.
[01:47:08.929 --> 01:47:15.855]  All of this was authorized, George Bush wrote, and condoned and put in place through his own repeated decisions.
[01:47:15.855 --> 01:47:19.497]  I'm sorry, that's not what George Bush wrote, that is being quoted from the story.
[01:47:19.497 --> 01:47:26.183]  All of this was authorized and condoned and put in place through his own repeated decisions, he being former President Bush.
[01:47:28.084 --> 01:47:32.928]  So Amnesty is saying he should be arrested when he shows up in Canada.
[01:47:32.928 --> 01:47:34.790]  Well that would be interesting.
[01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:41.696]  Wasn't Rumsfeld, didn't someone try to arrest Rumsfeld when he was traveling through Europe a couple of years ago?
[01:47:41.696 --> 01:47:50.803]  These sort of unindicted war criminals running around who many of the awakened people are trying to get arrested.
[01:47:50.803 --> 01:47:51.904]  That's an interesting bit of news.
[01:47:52.705 --> 01:48:02.329]  Yeah, if you have any more news coming in on either Fast and Furious or this false flag assassination attempt, just jump on in here, bring it to me.
[01:48:02.329 --> 01:48:06.631]  We're going to jump in at any moment that's necessary to cover this story.
[01:48:06.631 --> 01:48:08.311]  Let me ask you the question.
[01:48:08.311 --> 01:48:14.694]  Listeners, what do you suppose happens if Israel bombs Iran?
[01:48:16.329 --> 01:48:17.750]  What is the aftermath of that?
[01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:30.220]  Now, if you've been listening to the Alex Jones Show for any length of time, you probably have a very solid grasp of what we're talking about that would happen in the aftermath of that.
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:33.882]  And I'd love to have, man, I'd love to be talking to Bob Chapman right now about this.
[01:48:33.882 --> 01:48:36.184]  I would love to have Gerald Cilente on right now.
[01:48:36.184 --> 01:48:38.806]  But let me just take a whack at this.
[01:48:38.806 --> 01:48:42.709]  You can expect oil prices to just skyrocket globally.
[01:48:43.249 --> 01:48:46.150]  Massive spike in oil prices.
[01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:53.512]  Maybe gasoline at $5 to $10 a gallon in the aftermath of a strike on Iran.
[01:48:53.512 --> 01:48:55.052]  What about gold prices?
[01:48:55.052 --> 01:48:57.793]  Well, of course gold prices would spike.
[01:48:57.793 --> 01:48:58.933]  How high?
[01:48:58.933 --> 01:49:07.296]  We don't know, but maybe this would hit that $2,500 an ounce target that was mentioned previously, I believe, by Bank of America.
[01:49:07.296 --> 01:49:12.077]  What about people who would see this as an increased
[01:49:12.797 --> 01:49:17.120]  Tensioning of world events and they would be more interested in preparedness.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.143]  I think you would see a run on ammunition in the US.
[01:49:21.143 --> 01:49:25.446]  I think you'd see a run on preparedness supplies and preparedness food and gear.
[01:49:25.446 --> 01:49:33.931]  I think many of these companies that offer these products would be backordered after a strike on Iran.
[01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:42.177]  You would also have of course radioactive fallout if a nuclear facility, a nuclear processing facility
[01:49:42.837 --> 01:49:43.598]  We're good to go.
[01:50:03.788 --> 01:50:04.069]  I think so.
[01:50:23.662 --> 01:50:32.764]  In human lives and suffering and future sickness from the potential radioactive fallout if there is an Israeli strike on Iran.
[01:50:32.764 --> 01:50:39.466]  These are questions that you've got to consider now that the pretext for this is right in our faces.
[01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:42.187]  Now stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:42.187 --> 01:50:46.808]  We're going to continue to talk about this and we'll have more guests on on the other side of this break.
[01:50:46.808 --> 01:50:49.568]  I'm Mike Adams filling in today for Alex.
[01:50:49.568 --> 01:50:50.029]  Stay with us.
[01:50:50.029 --> 01:50:51.409]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:50:58.519 --> 01:51:02.362]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:51:02.362 --> 01:51:03.923]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:51:03.923 --> 01:51:05.284]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:07.265]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:51:07.265 --> 01:51:08.366]  It's not your fault.
[01:51:08.366 --> 01:51:11.428]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:51:11.428 --> 01:51:13.310]  And if you're an African-American man,
[01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:17.451]  You're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:51:17.451 --> 01:51:18.972]  Be the man you used to be.
[01:51:18.972 --> 01:51:28.574]  Call for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.
[01:51:28.574 --> 01:51:32.675]  You can feel the youthful energy and the healthy sex drive you once had.

[01:51:34.716 --> 01:51:36.538]  No injections or appointments.

[01:51:40.462 --> 01:51:40.702]  Call 1-800-497-8345.

[01:51:40.962 --> 01:51:43.305]  With Ageless Male, you can raise your testosterone naturally by 61%.

[01:51:43.605 --> 01:51:43.945]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:04.226]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[01:52:04.226 --> 01:52:07.428]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[01:52:48.979 --> 01:52:51.442]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.

[01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:04.935]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[01:53:04.935 --> 01:53:09.098]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[01:53:09.098 --> 01:53:14.863]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[01:53:14.863 --> 01:53:20.488]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[01:53:20.828 --> 01:53:27.392]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[01:53:27.392 --> 01:53:35.096]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[01:53:35.096 --> 01:53:43.921]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[01:53:44.321 --> 01:53:50.684]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method, which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[01:53:50.684 --> 01:53:53.865]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[01:53:53.865 --> 01:53:55.625]  That's survivalrx.com.
[01:53:55.625 --> 01:54:10.031]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man, to be the sad man.
[01:54:10.031 --> 01:54:11.912]  Behind blue eyes,
[01:54:15.539 --> 01:54:22.372]  Alright, check out the breaking news today on InfoWars.com about this issue.
[01:54:22.372 --> 01:54:24.736]  Gonna have a story posted there in just a few minutes.
[01:54:25.731 --> 01:54:26.791]  By Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:28.972]  Let's see, that's going to be maybe another 20 minutes.
[01:54:28.972 --> 01:54:31.313]  So, check that website.
[01:54:31.313 --> 01:54:33.453]  Nothing like a little pressure for those guys.
[01:54:33.453 --> 01:54:35.614]  By the way, I want to thank the crew here today.
[01:54:35.614 --> 01:54:47.497]  You know, every time I'm here on the Alex Jones Show, it's just such a great honor to be part of this and to be part of the whole listenership and to do something that matters for a change.
[01:54:47.497 --> 01:54:48.798]  You know what I mean out there?
[01:54:48.798 --> 01:54:50.218]  Do something that matters.
[01:54:50.218 --> 01:54:53.439]  And this crew does just a great job of pulling this show together every single day.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:55:00.385]  And all the guests and all the researchers and all the website artists and writers and everybody who does this.
[01:55:00.385 --> 01:55:09.773]  It's just an extraordinary organization of truly dedicated patriots and people who ultimately do not want to see more war.
[01:55:09.773 --> 01:55:15.417]  We all, you know, it's weird in the sense that we all stand for peace.
[01:55:16.178 --> 01:55:24.226]  You know, you may not think, well, oh, InfoWars and the Alex Jones Show, you don't normally think of a giant peace sign, but ultimately, really, we don't want wars.
[01:55:24.226 --> 01:55:25.408]  We don't want people to die.
[01:55:25.408 --> 01:55:32.415]  We don't want governments to bomb each other, and especially not to do it under the pretext of all these false operations.
[01:55:32.415 --> 01:55:35.198]  We want people to have freedom.
[01:55:36.363 --> 01:55:38.004]  Hey Mike, I'm just driving down the highway.
[01:55:38.004 --> 01:55:40.045]  You know, I had planned to take off a few days on a working vacation.
[01:55:40.045 --> 01:55:40.626]  Work is too cold.
[01:55:40.626 --> 01:55:43.528]  I'm gonna go out camping and stuff with the kids here.
[01:56:06.361 --> 01:56:08.463]  And, uh, did an hour for my house this morning.
[01:56:08.463 --> 01:56:11.006]  I'm now on the road, uh, calling in.
[01:56:11.006 --> 01:56:12.507]  How's my audio coming in, Roger?
[01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:13.768]  It's coming in loud and clear.
[01:56:13.768 --> 01:56:14.990]  Here, go ahead.
[01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:16.891]  Okay, uh, look.
[01:56:16.891 --> 01:56:23.558]  I've just been surfing on my little bubble of Slam Tracker iPhone while I'm listening to you on the other iPhone app.
[01:56:23.558 --> 01:56:27.542]  Plugged into the stereo here, uh, in the, uh, InfoWars mobile.
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.341]  And you mentioned the Charleston paper and others.
[01:56:31.341 --> 01:56:34.723]  The New York Times has come out and said this is baloney.
[01:56:34.723 --> 01:56:40.305]  And this isn't where they go out and set up the Iranian National, you know, Secret Police.
[01:56:40.305 --> 01:56:44.247]  This is where they just go out and usually recruit somebody to be part of the drill.
[01:56:44.247 --> 01:56:48.189]  And then the person takes part in the drill and they set them up.
[01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:50.590]  Or they're not even involved.
[01:56:50.590 --> 01:56:52.591]  Or they find a mentally ill person.
[01:56:52.591 --> 01:56:54.171]  Because that's the MO over and over again.
[01:56:54.171 --> 01:56:55.352]  And even Main Street Media has mentioned it.
[01:56:55.856 --> 01:57:07.528]  The FBI in the last two years, as you pointed out, more than a hundred cases of this have come out over and over again to create this perception of a threat instead of carrying out a big elaborate false flag like 9-11.
[01:57:07.528 --> 01:57:13.375]  But there's no doubt with Obama plunging, no doubt with the global bankers not getting their agenda through,
[01:57:14.338 --> 01:57:24.250]  But the global crisis that would come out of an Iran strike, even though it would be bad for the economy, people primitively tend to still rally around their governments in Europe and the U.S.
[01:57:24.250 --> 01:57:32.740]  And so, I've been saying, and just as you wrote two weeks ago, for your exact headline at naturalnews.com, it was something like, conditions now ripe for false flags.
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:33.762]  What was your exact headline?
[01:57:34.102 --> 01:57:34.702]  Yeah, that was it.
[01:57:34.702 --> 01:57:36.242]  Yeah, conditions are ripe.
[01:57:36.242 --> 01:57:42.444]  Because, like you said, remember the George Bush moment after 9-11 where he took the bullhorn and looked really presidential?
[01:57:42.444 --> 01:57:48.825]  This is what Obama is being set up for here, to look presidential in this war crisis.
[01:57:48.825 --> 01:57:50.545]  It's obvious.
[01:57:50.545 --> 01:57:51.045]  Exactly.
[01:57:51.045 --> 01:57:52.226]  You're exactly right.
[01:57:52.226 --> 01:57:52.766]  Hey, hold on one second.
[01:57:52.766 --> 01:57:53.126]  Hey, guys?
[01:57:53.126 --> 01:57:53.746]  Hey, kids?
[01:57:53.746 --> 01:57:55.026]  Please keep it down.
[01:57:55.026 --> 01:57:55.566]  I'm on the radio.
[01:57:55.566 --> 01:57:56.967]  Yeah, bear with us, folks.
[01:57:56.967 --> 01:57:59.447]  Live radio here, breaking news happening here.
[01:57:59.447 --> 01:58:01.508]  So, not scripted.
[01:58:01.508 --> 01:58:02.948]  Alex, go ahead, sir.
[01:58:05.843 --> 01:58:08.986]  Uh, I put my shot on hearing his analysis, though.
[01:58:08.986 --> 01:58:11.908]  It's probably better than the general public's understanding of this.
[01:58:11.908 --> 01:58:16.612]  I've heard all the neocons on the radio going... Uh, break it in 30 seconds, Alex.
[01:58:16.612 --> 01:58:19.254]  Time to, time to glass parking lot him.
[01:58:19.254 --> 01:58:23.157]  I'll go to break with him and come back and break down how serious this is.
[01:58:23.157 --> 01:58:24.959]  It's just green-lighted right now, folks.
[01:58:24.959 --> 01:58:27.641]  We gotta get the word out on this false flag hoax or it's over.
[01:58:27.641 --> 01:58:30.103]  They're going to World War III and that means their domestic agenda.
[01:58:30.103 --> 01:58:31.404]  Alright, stay with us, folks.
[01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:31.944]  We're going to break.
[01:58:31.944 --> 01:58:34.626]  We'll be right back more with Alex here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:34.626 --> 01:58:35.067]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.854 --> 01:58:42.426]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.426 --> 01:58:44.693]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:56.476]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:56.476 --> 01:58:59.038]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:58:59.038 --> 01:59:04.421]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.463]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:07.463 --> 01:59:09.524]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:09.764 --> 01:59:16.026]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:16.026 --> 01:59:19.387]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:19.387 --> 01:59:25.169]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:25.169 --> 01:59:26.830]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:28.110]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:28.110 --> 01:59:30.631]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:30.811 --> 01:59:34.993]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:34.993 --> 01:59:39.615]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:59:39.615 --> 01:59:42.217]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:59:42.217 --> 01:59:46.078]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:59:51.341 --> 01:59:53.742]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:53.742 --> 01:59:57.324]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:01.092 --> 02:00:05.916]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:05.916 --> 02:00:07.517]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.517 --> 02:00:09.058]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:09.058 --> 02:00:13.241]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.241 --> 02:00:15.582]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:16.483 --> 02:00:17.984]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.984 --> 02:00:25.169]  Extraordinary breaking news today on what is turning out to be pretext for potential war in the Middle East.
[02:00:25.169 --> 02:00:29.992]  And Alex is joining us by phone right now to continue analyzing this situation.
[02:00:29.992 --> 02:00:37.797]  There's a lot that's going to come out of this and you can expect continued coverage here on the Alex Jones Show and the InfoWars.com website.
[02:00:37.797 --> 02:00:39.818]  Alex, are you still with us on the phone?
[02:00:39.818 --> 02:00:40.158]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:40.158 --> 02:00:42.940]  I'm going to get out of here at the end of this segment.
[02:00:43.744 --> 02:00:46.366]  And let you get the calls of your other guests that are coming up.
[02:00:46.366 --> 02:00:49.249]  Then, of course, we've got Pepe Escobar, who was inside Libya.
[02:00:49.249 --> 02:00:51.691]  He concurs this is a false flag.
[02:00:51.691 --> 02:00:53.192]  In his words, inside job.
[02:00:53.192 --> 02:01:00.438]  He's going to be joining you on Infoworks Nightly News this evening, along with a guest that you wanted to have on, on other issues.
[02:01:00.438 --> 02:01:05.682]  Listen, right now, it is green-lighted.
[02:01:05.682 --> 02:01:13.048]  Israel is going ahead with the attack on Panetta's desk 10 days ago, as Ray McGovern said last week when he was on with us.
[02:01:14.148 --> 02:01:20.091]  And we gotta get Ray McGovern on tomorrow for like 10-15 minutes if he can do it.
[02:01:20.091 --> 02:01:22.833]  So all of that is happening.
[02:01:22.833 --> 02:01:24.834]  Obama is being politically destroyed.
[02:01:24.834 --> 02:01:26.335]  Israel wants to launch this attack.
[02:01:26.335 --> 02:01:29.476]  Netanyahu needs it politically.
[02:01:29.476 --> 02:01:30.577]  All of this is going on.
[02:01:30.577 --> 02:01:33.318]  Israel's lost wars in Lebanon and other areas.
[02:01:33.318 --> 02:01:36.520]  So the hawks over there are hot for this war.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.181]  It'll massively increase oil prices.
[02:01:38.181 --> 02:01:40.622]  The oil companies like that.
[02:01:40.622 --> 02:01:41.623]  It will hurdle the world.
[02:01:43.226 --> 02:01:47.508]  Into a massive global crisis.
[02:01:47.508 --> 02:01:52.630]  So, this is serious, serious, serious.
[02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:54.850]  Right now, it is green-lighted.
[02:01:54.850 --> 02:01:59.452]  This is not a potential green light.
[02:01:59.452 --> 02:02:07.055]  I've talked to two military sources and another through family, who's being shipped over there right now, and logistics.
[02:02:07.055 --> 02:02:07.795]  It is on.
[02:02:07.795 --> 02:02:08.255]  U.S.
[02:02:08.255 --> 02:02:10.036]  supporting Israel.
[02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:11.850]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[02:02:29.218 --> 02:02:38.205]  And you notice the neocons, or the Republican leadership that's demanding this new war, along with Israel, they're using that to get Obama in line for it.
[02:02:38.205 --> 02:02:39.346]  ISSA is.
[02:02:39.346 --> 02:02:50.634]  When Los Vetas and Sinaloa drug cartels shipping drugs into the United States and shipping guns down there, that goes back five and a half years.
[02:02:50.634 --> 02:02:53.076]  That's the end of the El Paso Times and other papers.
[02:02:53.076 --> 02:02:56.759]  So ISSA is using this right now
[02:02:57.805 --> 02:02:58.565]  We're good to go.
[02:03:12.639 --> 02:03:15.740]  Well, it seems like every war always has this fairy tale pretext.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:19.281]  Remember weapons of mass destruction?
[02:03:19.281 --> 02:03:22.442]  That was sold to us as the justification for it.
[02:03:22.442 --> 02:03:26.183]  Now we're going to have this embassy bombing attempt.
[02:03:26.183 --> 02:03:31.905]  Even if it later comes out that it was completely fabricated, the media will conveniently forget it.
[02:03:31.905 --> 02:03:37.407]  And they'll say, well, the war was justified anyway, all by itself, later on.
[02:03:37.407 --> 02:03:37.587]  Right?
[02:03:37.587 --> 02:03:39.788]  I mean, they have this strange memory of reality.
[02:03:42.329 --> 02:03:42.729]  Exactly.
[02:03:42.729 --> 02:03:44.230]  We've seen fraud after fraud.
[02:03:44.230 --> 02:03:46.291]  Hoax after hoax.
[02:03:46.291 --> 02:03:50.833]  The little nobody puppet teleprompter reader is being threatened right now.
[02:03:50.833 --> 02:03:52.674]  Hillary launched the Fast and Furious.
[02:03:52.674 --> 02:03:55.936]  They had it planned to set him up all along.
[02:03:55.936 --> 02:04:00.679]  But now these absolutely wicked, duplicitous scumbags work.
[02:04:00.679 --> 02:04:03.060]  Then they can get our guns, destroy our republic.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:08.643]  Remember during this war, they can put their Homeland Security on the streets, their TSA on the streets.
[02:04:08.643 --> 02:04:08.963]  Oh yeah.
[02:04:10.544 --> 02:04:11.704]  Yet another reason.
[02:04:11.704 --> 02:04:12.544]  Yeah, exactly right.
[02:04:12.544 --> 02:04:15.125]  Department of Homeland Security must be all over this, too.
[02:04:15.125 --> 02:04:15.765]  Well, this is the thing.
[02:04:15.765 --> 02:04:20.086]  There are so many people and organizations that benefit from this.
[02:04:20.086 --> 02:04:21.806]  How do we stop this, Alex?
[02:04:21.806 --> 02:04:29.087]  We've got to call into every talk radio show and point out it's staged because of the past serious cover-up that war was green-lighted.
[02:04:29.087 --> 02:04:30.667]  We've got to call Congress.
[02:04:30.667 --> 02:04:31.928]  We've got to support Ron Paul.
[02:04:31.928 --> 02:04:34.548]  This is also being used now to demonize Ron Paul.
[02:04:34.548 --> 02:04:36.408]  Look, he didn't want war with Iran.
[02:04:36.408 --> 02:04:37.409]  He's with them!
[02:04:37.409 --> 02:04:39.189]  We've got to get the word out on this, Mike.
[02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.829]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:04:42.935 --> 02:04:44.356]  All right, thank you, Alex, for joining us.
[02:04:44.356 --> 02:04:45.497]  We're going to break, folks.
[02:04:45.497 --> 02:04:46.018]  Stay with us.
[02:04:46.018 --> 02:04:48.280]  We will continue with more on the other side of this break.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:52.083]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show, breaking news all day long.
[02:04:52.083 --> 02:04:54.145]  It's a crazy world out there.
[02:04:54.145 --> 02:04:54.526]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.428 --> 02:05:00.971]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:00.971 --> 02:05:01.891]  Number 1.
[02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:05.314]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:05.314 --> 02:05:06.174]  Number 2.
[02:05:06.174 --> 02:05:11.077]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:11.077 --> 02:05:11.818]  It's true.
[02:05:11.818 --> 02:05:16.681]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:16.681 --> 02:05:17.501]  Number 3.
[02:05:17.501 --> 02:05:21.104]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:21.104 --> 02:05:24.786]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:24.986 --> 02:05:25.787]  Number 4.
[02:05:25.787 --> 02:05:28.549]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:28.549 --> 02:05:32.233]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:32.233 --> 02:05:33.034]  Number 5.
[02:05:33.034 --> 02:05:37.177]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:37.177 --> 02:05:41.942]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:42.222 --> 02:05:46.384]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:46.384 --> 02:05:48.185]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:48.185 --> 02:05:50.446]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:05:58.690 --> 02:06:10.978]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[02:06:10.978 --> 02:06:18.142]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[02:06:18.362 --> 02:06:22.465]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:06:22.465 --> 02:06:24.827]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[02:06:24.827 --> 02:06:29.650]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[02:06:29.650 --> 02:06:30.130]  A $259 value for only $1.99.
[02:06:30.130 --> 02:06:30.431]  Save $60 on $100.
[02:06:35.094 --> 02:06:35.434]  You bet!
[02:06:57.099 --> 02:06:58.801]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:58.801 --> 02:07:04.108]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:04.108 --> 02:07:05.651]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:14.442]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:15.163 --> 02:07:22.705]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:22.705 --> 02:07:30.708]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:30.708 --> 02:07:35.929]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:08:09.104 --> 02:08:13.306]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.306 --> 02:08:17.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.277 --> 02:08:30.197]  All right, welcome back, friends.
[02:08:30.197 --> 02:08:31.518]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:31.518 --> 02:08:35.639]  I'm the fill-in host today, Mike Adams, the editor of NaturalNews.com.
[02:08:35.639 --> 02:08:38.659]  We've been talking about this huge breaking news.
[02:08:38.659 --> 02:08:48.321]  Now I know why Alex keeps the studio so chilly in here with the air conditioning, because the news is so incredibly hot that you really have to have some extra A.C.
[02:08:48.321 --> 02:08:48.941]  to keep you going.
[02:08:48.941 --> 02:08:50.762]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:08:50.762 --> 02:08:53.022]  And it's not funny news, by the way.
[02:08:53.022 --> 02:08:57.003]  This is very disturbing news that we've been covering about the potential
[02:08:57.563 --> 02:09:01.786]  Pretext for war in the Middle East.
[02:09:01.786 --> 02:09:14.135]  Now, we're going to be joined, we have a scheduled guest here, going to be joining us here shortly, Mark Castell from the Cornucopia Institute to talk about GMOs and natural cereal products.
[02:09:14.135 --> 02:09:16.097]  I'll give you a brief intro on that here in a second.
[02:09:16.577 --> 02:09:22.003]  But I just want you to know, we will continue to return to the big breaking news of today.
[02:09:22.003 --> 02:09:30.052]  So we'll give you the latest updates on that, close to the bottom of the hour and also at the top of this hour as well.
[02:09:30.052 --> 02:09:36.039]  And we'll see if we can get the headlines from Paul Joseph Watson's story, which should be posted shortly.
[02:09:36.039 --> 02:09:37.501]  We spoke to him in the last hour.
[02:09:38.652 --> 02:09:43.954]  Now, Cornucopia Institute has put out just an extraordinary new piece of research.
[02:09:43.954 --> 02:09:47.616]  This actually came out, what was it, Tuesday.
[02:09:47.616 --> 02:09:57.680]  In fact, we were the first to carry the news, Natural News, and Cornucopia has tested all of these cereal products that claim to be natural.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:03.803]  Now, here's why this is important out there, because all of you listening, you know you want to avoid GMOs.
[02:10:04.483 --> 02:10:06.085]  Most people do.
[02:10:06.085 --> 02:10:14.893]  Surveys now say that something like 80-90% of people who are aware of the issue, they want to avoid genetically engineered ingredients in their food.
[02:10:14.893 --> 02:10:27.405]  So these food companies, the big mega corporations, they continue to use genetically engineered corn and soy and cotton seed oil and canola oil in their products.
[02:10:28.806 --> 02:10:40.631]  But they label them as natural because they know that most moms, most people shopping in the grocery stores, when they look on the store shelf and they see a box of cereal and it says, oh, it's all natural.
[02:10:41.664 --> 02:10:48.492]  Wholesome, from the earth, and it has a wonderful, beautiful name, and it has pictures of grain on it, and pictures of the earth on it.
[02:10:48.492 --> 02:10:55.460]  They think, the consumers think, and they've been misled, they think that that means no GMOs.
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:57.743]  They think that that means no pesticides.
[02:10:57.743 --> 02:10:58.844]  They think it means organic.
[02:10:59.625 --> 02:11:01.066]  But it doesn't!
[02:11:01.066 --> 02:11:07.108]  And this is the scam that is being exposed by the Cornucopia Institute.
[02:11:07.108 --> 02:11:18.111]  So joining us today from that institute is Mark Castell, the executive director there who was instrumental in putting this story together and breaking this news to the world.
[02:11:18.111 --> 02:11:20.232]  Mark, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:11:20.232 --> 02:11:22.173]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:11:22.173 --> 02:11:22.693]  Hi, Mike.
[02:11:22.693 --> 02:11:25.034]  Hey, it's great to have you on.
[02:11:25.034 --> 02:11:28.115]  Greetings from not-so-stunny Wisconsin today.
[02:11:29.545 --> 02:11:31.347]  Yeah, a lot going on in Wisconsin.
[02:11:31.347 --> 02:11:36.171]  I bet you've been hammered by a media request since putting this story out.
[02:11:36.171 --> 02:11:39.073]  What has been the reaction so far?
[02:11:39.073 --> 02:11:40.835]  Well, it's been big.
[02:11:40.835 --> 02:11:46.299]  Obviously, you have a lot of followers on your natural news website.
[02:11:46.299 --> 02:11:55.907]  It's now been just, I don't know if viral is the right term, but it's been carried by quite a few of the prominent websites, trade media.
[02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:57.729]  We're starting to get calls now from
[02:11:58.701 --> 02:11:59.162]  We're good.
[02:12:19.162 --> 02:12:23.563]  And let's also define what's not natural.
[02:12:23.563 --> 02:12:43.828]  I think if Monsanto splices genes together and puts a naturally occurring pesticide in corn, something that doesn't appear in the natural genome, wasn't created by God, was created by scientists to make a profit, most of us wouldn't call that, quote, natural.
[02:12:44.426 --> 02:12:54.571]  So it's outrageous that marketers can decide to put that word natural on a label and then include genetically modified organisms.
[02:12:54.571 --> 02:13:00.073]  Or we could even talk about how that grain is raised besides the GMOs.
[02:13:00.073 --> 02:13:13.600]  And the USDA has done extensive study of cereal grains and found high residues of many toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in the commodities themselves.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.240]  Those aren't natural.
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:22.661]  And to make matters worse, I'd say this is almost rubbing salt in the wounds.
[02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:35.484]  After you get done harvesting those genetically engineered crops that were sprayed maybe with glyphosate, Roundup is Monsanto's trade name for the most popular herbicide in the world.
[02:13:35.484 --> 02:13:43.625]  After you get done harvesting those crops, you put them in a storage bin, and then you spray them with what's commonly called a crop protectant.
[02:13:44.295 --> 02:13:46.296]  That's a fancy word for pesticide.
[02:13:46.296 --> 02:13:53.881]  They're spraying right on the oats or right on the wheat to make sure that rodents and bugs don't eat them in storage.
[02:13:53.881 --> 02:13:56.282]  And then they're in your kid's breakfast cereal.
[02:13:56.282 --> 02:13:59.084]  I just don't consider it natural and that's why we've
[02:13:59.921 --> 02:14:17.383]  We've published this report to try to differentiate what the difference is between certified organic food, where there are some standards, and natural, where the standards are developed by the marketing executives and they mean whatever they want them to say.
[02:14:17.648 --> 02:14:35.070]  Alright so very quickly then, the most important takeaway point from this for those listening is that the word natural on grocery products is essentially meaningless and your organization through lab testing with a reputable lab that you already have
[02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:38.891]  It told me the name of them, so I know that they're reputable.
[02:14:38.891 --> 02:14:58.526]  I don't know if you've released that publicly, but you found pesticide residues in so-called, or I'm sorry, you found genetically engineered ingredients in so-called natural products, and you also know that the USDA says that these pesticides are typically used in those conventional grains that are found in natural products as well.
[02:14:58.526 --> 02:14:59.527]  Is that correct?
[02:14:59.527 --> 02:15:00.388]  That's correct, Mike.
[02:15:00.388 --> 02:15:01.449]  To make matters worse,
[02:15:02.245 --> 02:15:14.649]  Not only did we find high levels of GMOs, we're talking about 28 to 100 percent, so this was not a little drift from the next farm or a grain bin that wasn't quite cleaned out well.
[02:15:14.649 --> 02:15:17.569]  The crops themselves were genetically engineered.
[02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:25.752]  So not only did we find that in, quote, natural cereal, some of those cereals were actually touting themselves as being GMO-free.
[02:15:26.352 --> 02:15:32.104]  So it was really borderline or outright consumer fraud here.
[02:15:32.571 --> 02:15:36.752]  Well, this has sent shockwaves through the natural health industry.
[02:15:36.752 --> 02:15:43.553]  I mean, I've talked to many influential people in the industry who are very concerned.
[02:15:43.553 --> 02:15:47.254]  Obviously, everybody wants the term organic to mean something.
[02:15:47.254 --> 02:15:52.055]  They want a non-GMO certification to really mean non-GMOs.
[02:15:52.055 --> 02:15:53.335]  And there's concern right now.
[02:15:53.335 --> 02:15:55.056]  A lot of consumers are confused.
[02:15:55.056 --> 02:15:55.896]  I mean, they're upset.
[02:15:56.576 --> 02:15:58.017]  We've had people who are upset.
[02:15:58.017 --> 02:16:02.780]  They were buying a brand and they thought it was GMO free and it turns out it's not.
[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:09.425]  Was there a serial brand that came out of this squeaky clean that can be trusted, Mark?
[02:16:09.425 --> 02:16:09.985]  Yes.
[02:16:09.985 --> 02:16:23.795]  In fact, what I want to encourage your listeners to do and your readers on your website is to go to the Cornucopia Institute website and that's c-o-r-n-u-c-o-p-i-a dot o-r-g
[02:16:24.753 --> 02:16:28.935]  Go to the Cornucopia Institute website and visit the serial report.
[02:16:28.935 --> 02:16:30.896]  It's called Serial Crimes.
[02:16:30.896 --> 02:16:38.939]  And on that, we have a scorecard where we list all the name brands, organic and natural, and what their policies are.
[02:16:38.939 --> 02:16:40.240]  And we rate them.
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:46.662]  And I'm happy to tell you that there are a bunch of 100% organic brands that you can really trust.
[02:16:46.662 --> 02:16:48.003]  And here's the kicker.
[02:16:48.003 --> 02:16:49.864]  Some of these, quote, natural brands,
[02:16:50.584 --> 02:16:52.786]  They cost more expensive than the organic ones.
[02:16:52.786 --> 02:16:53.867]  Oh yeah, I saw that.
[02:16:53.867 --> 02:16:55.348]  Yeah, pretty outrageous.
[02:16:55.348 --> 02:17:12.720]  You know, the other interesting thing that the listeners might not be aware of is that many of these, quote, independent, kind of green, crunchy companies, we are talking about granola here, are actually hiding behind a facade.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:14.842]  One of the biggest companies is Kashi.
[02:17:15.829 --> 02:17:17.470]  Uh, they're owned by Kellogg's.
[02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:21.013]  You'll never see the name Kellogg's on a package or their website.
[02:17:21.013 --> 02:17:23.495]  Another brand is Bare Naked Granola.
[02:17:23.495 --> 02:17:26.217]  It's one of the largest selling granola brands.
[02:17:26.217 --> 02:17:34.243]  Probably the most expensive on the store shelf at your grocery, whether you shop at Safeway or Whole Foods or one of the co-ops.
[02:17:34.243 --> 02:17:35.704]  Very expensive.
[02:17:35.704 --> 02:17:37.585]  That's owned by Kellogg's as well.
[02:17:37.585 --> 02:17:42.749]  Another granola brand, Back to Nature, that sounds nice, that's owned by Kraft.
[02:17:42.749 --> 02:17:44.450]  But you'll never see their name on there either.
[02:17:45.034 --> 02:17:47.796]  Yeah, doesn't PepsiCo own one of the major brands out there?
[02:17:47.796 --> 02:17:48.456]  Is that Mothers?
[02:17:48.456 --> 02:17:52.459]  Yeah, I think that's PepsiCo.
[02:17:52.459 --> 02:18:01.766]  Most of these people know that Quaker is PepsiCo and I believe Mothers also.
[02:18:06.744 --> 02:18:14.209]  When consumers are looking for value-added food and they're willing to pay a premium for it, most of the time that means organic.
[02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:18.572]  These natural ones are what I like to call organic light.
[02:18:18.572 --> 02:18:23.155]  Folks aren't just buying the granola or the cereal or the milk.
[02:18:23.155 --> 02:18:25.136]  They're buying the story behind that label.
[02:18:25.136 --> 02:18:27.818]  How it was produced, where it was produced.
[02:18:27.818 --> 02:18:30.960]  And they think they're supporting sound environmental stewardship.
[02:18:31.596 --> 02:18:37.003]  They think that they're supporting more humane animal husbandry when it comes to meat and dairy.
[02:18:37.003 --> 02:18:44.392]  And they think that one of the reasons it costs more is that economic justice for family farmers is built right into the price.
[02:18:44.392 --> 02:18:49.939]  So when they find out, we're really talking about giant agribusinesses, giant corporations.
[02:18:50.555 --> 02:18:51.396]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:14.250]  Mark, I want to ask you to stay with us.
[02:19:14.250 --> 02:19:19.513]  We're about to go to a break, but I have a couple more questions for you on the other side of this coming break.
[02:19:19.513 --> 02:19:31.380]  Specifically, I'd like to ask you, what can parents and consumers look for on the labels to be as sure as possible that there are no GMOs in those products?
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:35.743]  To the best of your knowledge, I'd like to ask you that question when we return.
[02:19:35.743 --> 02:19:37.043]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:37.043 --> 02:19:41.366]  We're going to continue to cover GMOs and the breaking news of today, the false flag
[02:19:41.886 --> 02:19:44.293]  assassination, embassy bombing attempt.
[02:19:44.293 --> 02:19:45.115]  So stay with us here.
[02:19:45.115 --> 02:19:47.040]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:56.189 --> 02:20:00.732]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:00.732 --> 02:20:01.653]  Number one.
[02:20:01.653 --> 02:20:05.076]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:05.076 --> 02:20:05.936]  Number two.
[02:20:05.936 --> 02:20:10.820]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:11.560]  It's true.
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:16.444]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:16.444 --> 02:20:17.265]  Number three.
[02:20:17.265 --> 02:20:20.847]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:20.847 --> 02:20:24.550]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:25.551]  Number 4.
[02:20:25.551 --> 02:20:28.312]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:28.312 --> 02:20:31.994]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:31.994 --> 02:20:32.775]  Number 5.
[02:20:32.775 --> 02:20:36.917]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:36.917 --> 02:20:41.680]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:46.143]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:21:51.183 --> 02:21:52.584]  MySafeDoor.com.
[02:21:52.584 --> 02:21:54.145]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[02:21:56.371 --> 02:22:01.053]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:22:01.053 --> 02:22:06.935]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:22:06.935 --> 02:22:09.756]  Number one, study the past.
[02:22:09.756 --> 02:22:12.157]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:22:12.157 --> 02:22:15.879]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.081]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:22:20.081 --> 02:22:23.943]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:22:23.943 --> 02:22:28.985]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:22:28.985 --> 02:22:32.407]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:22:32.987 --> 02:22:36.388]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:22:36.388 --> 02:22:40.889]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:22:40.889 --> 02:22:45.811]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:22:45.811 --> 02:22:50.432]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:22:50.432 --> 02:22:52.593]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:22:54.585 --> 02:23:01.209]  What you're about to hear is the real experience of women over 40 who finally lost weight, even around the stubborn belly area.
[02:23:01.209 --> 02:23:01.769]  How?
[02:23:01.769 --> 02:23:03.910]  By becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:07.032]  Their secret is the Amberin Slim After 40 program.
[02:23:07.032 --> 02:23:11.555]  Amberin is the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:23:11.795 --> 02:23:15.457]  You see, the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:23:15.457 --> 02:23:18.879]  Unless you balance your hormones, losing weight may be impossible.
[02:23:18.879 --> 02:23:22.841]  But the Amberin Slim After 40 program changes all of that.
[02:23:22.841 --> 02:23:25.422]  Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally.
[02:23:25.422 --> 02:23:31.725]  Plus, it dramatically boosts your cell metabolism, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:23:31.725 --> 02:23:39.049]  Plus, Amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:23:46.093 --> 02:23:46.153]  1-800-894-8776.
[02:24:04.332 --> 02:24:07.218]  Yeah, we are back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.218 --> 02:24:08.680]  Thank you for listening in today.
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:14.190]  I'm the fill-in host, Mike Adams, the health ranger, I'm sometimes called.
[02:24:15.495 --> 02:24:21.979]  Happy to join in and fill in today with the whole crew here, the InfoWars crew doing a fantastic job as usual.
[02:24:21.979 --> 02:24:37.029]  And we are joined right now by Mark Castell from the Cornucopia Institute, which has released a groundbreaking new report exposing the genetically engineered ingredient content in, quote, natural foods.
[02:24:37.029 --> 02:24:38.190]  It's extraordinary.
[02:24:38.190 --> 02:24:44.875]  We're going to talk to Mark for a couple more minutes, and then we're going to summarize some additional breaking news on the other news fronts.
[02:24:45.775 --> 02:24:47.657]  Oh man, it is a day of just incredible news.
[02:24:47.657 --> 02:24:48.938]  There's so much going on here.
[02:24:48.938 --> 02:24:56.243]  If you see me looking around, if you're watching this on PrisonPlanet.tv, it's because I'm surrounded by headlines and stories everywhere.
[02:24:56.243 --> 02:24:58.025]  There's so much to bring in.
[02:24:58.025 --> 02:25:02.928]  There's no way we're going to get to it all, but let's continue with Mark Castell here from Cornucopia.
[02:25:02.928 --> 02:25:08.232]  I asked you a question before the break, Mark, about how can parents and consumers know
[02:25:09.333 --> 02:25:17.457]  With at least some certainty, which cereals they can trust to be completely or substantially free of GMOs?
[02:25:17.457 --> 02:25:36.586]  Well, I think the best weapon in making sure that A, you have the safest food in terms of chemical residues, GMOs, antibiotics, hormones, is to look for that organic seal and to buy products that qualify for organic certification.
[02:25:38.453 --> 02:25:44.605]  That is by far the most comprehensive food production system that there's out there.
[02:25:45.496 --> 02:25:49.858]  It has federal law governing the standards.
[02:25:49.858 --> 02:25:58.122]  It has lots of independent certifiers that inspect every farm and every plant every year to obtain that certification.
[02:25:58.122 --> 02:26:09.227]  And then it has governmental and corporate watchdogs like the Cornucopia Institute to make sure that the USDA is actually fulfilling their duties, and they haven't always done that.
[02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.668]  But there are lots of, most importantly, stakeholders.
[02:26:12.188 --> 02:26:19.990]  The individual farmers that believe in this, the consumers that believe in this, that's our intelligence agents out here at the Cornucopia Institute.
[02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:24.391]  We hear about problems, we're able to look at them.
[02:26:24.391 --> 02:26:28.932]  Other than organics, there's nobody looking over the shoulder of corporate agribusiness.
[02:26:28.932 --> 02:26:30.353]  They're just kind of painting this
[02:26:31.457 --> 02:26:32.118]  We're good to go.
[02:26:42.537 --> 02:26:44.958]  Well, that's the other angle on this that really shocks a lot of people.
[02:26:44.958 --> 02:26:47.478]  And by the way, Jaren, can you bring up a symbol?
[02:26:47.478 --> 02:26:51.419]  Search the image of the USDA organic seal.
[02:26:51.419 --> 02:26:54.620]  I'd like to put that on the screen for those watching this.
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:27:00.702]  It's a green circular symbol and you need to be familiar with this symbol so that you can look for it.
[02:27:00.702 --> 02:27:02.062]  That's what Mark was just mentioning.
[02:27:02.742 --> 02:27:06.326]  If it doesn't have that symbol, it's not certified by the USDA.
[02:27:06.326 --> 02:27:15.054]  And even though I personally don't have a lot of nice words for the USDA in general, I do know that their organic certification program is rock solid.
[02:27:15.054 --> 02:27:20.279]  I've seen their inspectors working and inspecting, and they actually do a very good job.
[02:27:20.279 --> 02:27:24.163]  That symbol means something, and I support that symbol.
[02:27:24.163 --> 02:27:25.104]  Any comments on that, Mark?
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:37.125]  Yeah, we've seen the organic programs relatively young, and during the first years we uncovered a pretty fair amount of corruption.
[02:27:37.125 --> 02:27:40.047]  At one point we partnered with Cornucopia and the
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:53.571]  Um, a Washington Post on an expose of kind of a way too cozy relationship between the woman who was running the National Organic Program during the Bush administration and corporate lobbyists.
[02:27:53.571 --> 02:27:57.354]  And they were putting some synthetics in food that were illegal.
[02:27:57.354 --> 02:28:02.298]  They were allowing some giant factory farms to produce eggs and milk.
[02:28:02.298 --> 02:28:04.040]  And we've cleaned that up.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:06.642]  I, you know, I think the legacy of
[02:28:08.364 --> 02:28:20.858]  Barack Obama at the USDA is mixed at best, but in terms of the organic program, they've appointed some people with high integrity, and it's not where it should be yet.
[02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:24.682]  It's not 100% bulletproof, Mike, but it's getting there.
[02:28:24.682 --> 02:28:26.785]  I think your impression is generally accurate.
[02:28:27.383 --> 02:28:47.519]  Well, the other thing that people need to realize, and this was also mentioned in your report in various ways, that GMO contamination is so widespread right now that it's virtually impossible to get a breakfast cereal made with corn or soy that doesn't have at least some small level of GMO contamination.
[02:28:47.519 --> 02:28:49.040]  But that might only be, what, 0.1% to 0.5%?
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:49.781]  Something like that?
[02:28:49.781 --> 02:28:50.642]  Yeah, there are very low thresholds.
[02:28:56.886 --> 02:29:11.056]  This really amounts to the fact that no matter what our number one issue is, and right now we're talking about food, but it could be about, you know, whether the citizenry gets accurate information before we go to war.
[02:29:11.056 --> 02:29:13.878]  I mean, this is like deja vu all over again.
[02:29:13.878 --> 02:29:16.339]  I mean, remember the Taken Gulf Resolution?
[02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:20.281]  Mark, I'm sorry I've got to cut you off here.
[02:29:20.281 --> 02:29:28.165]  We're closing out this segment, and I want to thank you for joining us and encourage those listening to go to cornucopia.org to learn more.
[02:29:28.165 --> 02:29:30.786]  Mark, really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us.
[02:29:30.786 --> 02:29:32.146]  Thanks for having us, Mike.
[02:29:32.146 --> 02:29:33.467]  Great to have you on.
[02:29:33.467 --> 02:29:34.167]  Stay with us.
[02:29:34.167 --> 02:29:42.491]  We have a lot more breaking news, including a new headline just out from The Guardian that says, Saudis say Iran must pay the price for this alleged plot.
[02:29:42.491 --> 02:29:42.991]  Stay with us.
[02:29:42.991 --> 02:29:44.432]  We'll be right back with more on that.
[02:29:45.748 --> 02:29:48.733]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:48.733 --> 02:29:52.338]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.314 --> 02:30:00.476]  You're subject to public police action.
[02:30:00.476 --> 02:30:01.738]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:01.738 --> 02:30:05.621]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:05.621 --> 02:30:07.924]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:07.924 --> 02:30:13.790]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:20.036]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:20.436 --> 02:30:26.401]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:26.401 --> 02:30:30.605]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:30.605 --> 02:30:34.889]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:34.889 --> 02:30:40.834]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:40.834 --> 02:30:44.397]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:44.397 --> 02:30:46.358]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:46.358 --> 02:30:46.799]  It's here.

[02:31:03.252 --> 02:31:08.396]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:08.396 --> 02:31:15.161]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:17.130 --> 02:31:23.298]  They sow pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:31:35.281 --> 02:31:37.422]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:31:37.422 --> 02:31:39.203]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:31:39.203 --> 02:31:42.085]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:31:42.085 --> 02:31:46.328]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[02:31:51.431 --> 02:31:53.012]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:31:53.012 --> 02:31:53.792]  Got it.
[02:31:53.792 --> 02:31:54.653]  Others don't.
[02:31:55.771 --> 02:31:58.293]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:58.293 --> 02:32:10.585]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[02:32:10.585 --> 02:32:17.752]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[02:32:17.952 --> 02:32:22.076]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:32:22.076 --> 02:32:24.418]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[02:32:24.418 --> 02:32:29.462]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[02:32:29.462 --> 02:32:30.102]  A $259 value for only $1.99.
[02:32:30.102 --> 02:32:32.304]  Save $60 on 160 servings of the best food on the planet.
[02:32:32.304 --> 02:32:34.206]  Call 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[02:32:42.913 --> 02:32:43.954]  He's going the distance.
[02:32:43.954 --> 02:32:45.035]  He's going for speed.
[02:32:45.035 --> 02:32:45.835]  She's all alone.
[02:32:45.835 --> 02:32:47.016]  All alone in a time of need.
[02:32:47.016 --> 02:32:48.557]  Because he's racing and racing and racing.
[02:33:13.326 --> 02:33:17.048]  All right, an action-packed, news-filled day here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.048 --> 02:33:21.990]  I'm your fill-in host for today, Mike Adams, the editor of NaturalNews.com.
[02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:27.192]  And I think Kurt Nemo just put up a story on Infowars.com about Walgreens.
[02:33:27.192 --> 02:33:29.733]  This is a story that I wrote yesterday.
[02:33:29.733 --> 02:33:36.676]  Walgreens, we've been getting reports from Walgreens customers that they feel like they're being bullied about getting a flu shot.
[02:33:37.336 --> 02:33:38.477]  At Walgreens.
[02:33:38.477 --> 02:33:40.599]  Like they're checking out at the checkout counter, you know?
[02:33:40.599 --> 02:33:43.301]  And the employees there are saying, have you had a flu shot?
[02:33:43.301 --> 02:33:44.102]  Do you want a flu shot?
[02:33:44.102 --> 02:33:45.863]  Go get a flu shot!
[02:33:45.863 --> 02:33:56.472]  And we're being told by people who say they are Walgreens employees that they're being rewarded with iPads if they meet a certain number of flu shot recruiting goals.
[02:33:57.819 --> 02:34:06.322]  Now for the record, the Walgreens corporate media spokesperson that I spoke to yesterday denies any knowledge of this.
[02:34:06.322 --> 02:34:10.183]  He didn't deny that it's happening, he just says that he wasn't aware of this.
[02:34:10.183 --> 02:34:23.248]  So we posted a story, and now InfoWars has got the story, where if you have been bullied by Walgreens, get onto that story, click the links, and file a complaint with Walgreens, or with CVS Pharmacies.
[02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:29.111]  They are pushing these vaccines so aggressively that people are getting angry.
[02:34:29.111 --> 02:34:35.435]  And now you can take a stand against that by lodging a complaint with one or both of these pharmacies.
[02:34:35.435 --> 02:34:41.158]  Or you could just, I guess, shut up and take your flu shot, which is what the vaccine industry wants you to do.
[02:34:41.158 --> 02:34:43.480]  That's not okay with us around here.
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:43.920]  Where are we?
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:44.680]  All right.
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:50.344]  We have been talking with Mark Castell from the Cornucopia Institute about GMOs in natural food products.
[02:34:51.364 --> 02:34:52.305]  That was a really good segment.
[02:34:52.305 --> 02:34:54.507]  If you missed that, go back and check the archives.
[02:34:54.507 --> 02:35:01.233]  Make sure you understand that the term natural doesn't mean really anything in the food marketplace today.
[02:35:01.233 --> 02:35:10.281]  In this segment, we're going to be joined by Mike Bundrant, who is a psychologist, very experienced in the realms of neuroscience.
[02:35:12.664 --> 02:35:15.908]  And in fact, this gets to just an amazing story.
[02:35:15.908 --> 02:35:20.933]  Here it is, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.
[02:35:20.933 --> 02:35:28.542]  This scientific study is entitled, How Unrealistic Optimism is Maintained in the Face of Reality.
[02:35:29.703 --> 02:35:31.064]  Now, this is fascinating stuff.
[02:35:31.064 --> 02:35:41.308]  You'll want to tune in on this, because it explains why about four out of five people in the general population, they have something different about their brains.
[02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:48.855]  That doesn't allow them to code in to grasp the reality of something negative.
[02:35:48.855 --> 02:36:05.689]  This is why about 80% of the people you might see out there don't get it when it comes to false flag attacks, or vaccines, or fluoride in the water supply, or how big government is really trying to destroy your freedoms and take away your rights rather than save you and protect you and do all these things.
[02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:17.292]  If you've ever asked the question, why don't people understand when I'm telling them about the reality that's out there, this scientific study could help explain that.
[02:36:17.292 --> 02:36:22.653]  So joining us to analyze this and give us further details is Mike Bundrent.
[02:36:22.653 --> 02:36:30.234]  He's also the publisher of Healthy Times newspaper that you'll find throughout California and other regions.
[02:36:30.234 --> 02:36:31.275]  Mike, are you with us?
[02:36:31.275 --> 02:36:31.835]  I'm with you.
[02:36:31.835 --> 02:36:32.615]  How are you doing, Mike?
[02:36:33.101 --> 02:36:33.882]  I am doing great.
[02:36:33.882 --> 02:36:37.866]  Thank you for joining us today and I really appreciate your input on this.
[02:36:37.866 --> 02:36:39.708]  What do you think about this study?
[02:36:39.708 --> 02:36:42.050]  Well, it's a very interesting study.
[02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:53.201]  I have to say that it doesn't come as a total shock for anyone who, you know, thinks a little bit about human nature and what's going on around us.
[02:36:54.288 --> 02:36:55.169]  I don't know.
[02:37:13.246 --> 02:37:22.595]  Actually taking scans of people's brains and the way they work in the face of news that is worse than expected.
[02:37:22.595 --> 02:37:32.464]  And the frontal lobe actually shuts down, of course not entirely, but it doesn't process information that is news that's worse than expected.
[02:37:32.464 --> 02:37:36.688]  It's fascinating, but it sort of confirms probably what a lot of people know.
[02:37:37.264 --> 02:37:42.866]  Well, let me read from the abstract of this study again, which was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.
[02:37:42.866 --> 02:37:52.751]  And in the abstract it says, quote, highly optimistic individuals exhibited, quote, reduced tracking of estimation errors that called for negative update.
[02:37:53.954 --> 02:38:01.359]  In right inferior prefrontal gyrus, these findings indicate that optimism is tied to a selective update failure.
[02:38:01.359 --> 02:38:04.420]  Now, this is pretty technical language.
[02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:06.442]  What does that mean in layman's terms?
[02:38:06.442 --> 02:38:06.942]  Break it down.
[02:38:06.942 --> 02:38:08.283]  Make it even simpler for us, Mike.
[02:38:08.283 --> 02:38:09.844]  I'll make it even simpler.
[02:38:09.844 --> 02:38:16.448]  Basically, I guess you could say that overly optimistic people are brain damaged, Mike.
[02:38:20.039 --> 02:38:24.140]  I guess that's a little too simplistic.
[02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:36.062]  But here's the way that I understand this, that we are talking about these people in the study were presented with negative information, information that's worse than expected.
[02:38:36.062 --> 02:38:42.183]  And so if you ask me, Mike, what's the chance that you'll get cancer in your lifetime?
[02:38:42.183 --> 02:38:45.023]  And I say, well, I'd say it's 10%.
[02:38:45.023 --> 02:38:48.984]  And you say, actually, the statistics, the data suggests
[02:38:49.696 --> 02:38:53.579]  That you have a 30% chance of getting cancer.
[02:38:53.579 --> 02:39:01.205]  If I'm one of these overly optimistic people, I will literally, my frontal lobe will not process that information.
[02:39:01.205 --> 02:39:05.129]  And I will not adjust my expectations accordingly.
[02:39:05.129 --> 02:39:07.811]  Effectively, keeping me in denial.
[02:39:08.686 --> 02:39:21.510]  And we see this across the population on many issues that I hinted at earlier, that people, you know, when you tell people about, well, 9-11 was an inside job, let's say, and they might reply, no, it couldn't be.
[02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:23.090]  Be more optimistic.
[02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:24.631]  Why aren't you more optimistic?
[02:39:24.631 --> 02:39:27.392]  You hear that a lot in the deniers out there.
[02:39:27.392 --> 02:39:31.413]  Do you think this helps explain cognitively what's happening in their brains?
[02:39:31.693 --> 02:39:35.655]  I think it actually explains what's happening in their brain.
[02:39:35.655 --> 02:39:39.437]  And let's talk a little bit about the role of denial.
[02:39:39.437 --> 02:39:43.800]  Denial is like fire.
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:49.543]  It's a precious gift and it's a dangerous enemy, depending on how you use it.
[02:39:49.543 --> 02:40:00.409]  If we didn't have the capability of denying certain realities or certain possibilities, then we would literally be overwhelmed.
[02:40:01.698 --> 02:40:13.161]  With worry and fear from everything from did I leave the iron on when I left the house this morning to when am I going to die?
[02:40:13.161 --> 02:40:22.943]  If I couldn't filter out all there is to worry about in life and just effectively deny that and focus on what I want to focus on
[02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:25.730]  None of us could function.
[02:40:25.730 --> 02:40:31.956]  Right, so there's a positive role for this, too, in the sense that this helps us adapt to reality.
[02:40:31.956 --> 02:40:37.642]  What about the idea of holding out real hope for freedom, for example?
[02:40:37.642 --> 02:40:40.544]  How do we maintain optimism in the face of so much tyranny?
[02:40:40.544 --> 02:40:45.289]  This phenomenon actually could help us in that context.
[02:40:48.036 --> 02:40:49.817]  We've got to get past the denial.
[02:40:49.817 --> 02:40:59.920]  In other words, in order for real optimism, or pessimism for that matter, to take place, we have to be dealing with the truth.
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:10.083]  So for example, let's say that it's the 10th of the month and I only have $100 in my checking account to make it to the end of the month, which is not a lot of money.
[02:41:10.083 --> 02:41:14.525]  And if I could be optimistic or pessimistic about that, I could be optimistic and say,
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:18.902]  It's a challenge, but I'm going to find a way to make this work.
[02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:19.883]  I'm going to cut back.
[02:41:19.883 --> 02:41:27.127]  I can do X, Y, and Z, and I'm going to get to the end of the month, and I know I can make it happen, and so forth, and I come up with a plan.
[02:41:27.127 --> 02:41:37.154]  Or I could be pessimistic and say, oh, jeez, this isn't going to happen, and I'm going to lose my house, but I don't know what I'm going to do.
[02:41:37.154 --> 02:41:39.816]  I have a choice to be optimistic or pessimistic.
[02:41:39.816 --> 02:41:43.338]  What we're talking about here, though, with this study is that
[02:41:44.275 --> 02:41:52.342]  I'm not even acknowledging how much money is in my checking account in the first place, so I'm just in a different reality.
[02:41:52.342 --> 02:41:58.807]  I'm just denying reality in this situation, and that's what's dangerous.
[02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:12.637]  We have to break through that barrier of denial and allow people, help people understand the reality of what's going on.
[02:42:12.637 --> 02:42:16.900]  Then let's be optimistic, but let's be optimistic based on the truth.
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:21.823]  There's really no problem or very few problems that we can't solve, right?
[02:42:21.823 --> 02:42:22.604]  But if we don't
[02:42:23.184 --> 02:42:27.985]  Well, what's extraordinary about this is this term now is going to become, I think, a part of mainstream vernacular.
[02:42:27.985 --> 02:42:29.046]  That term is unrealistic optimism.
[02:42:29.046 --> 02:42:33.227]  So folks, if you're listening, I want you to repeat that term a couple of times.
[02:42:51.371 --> 02:42:52.971]  Because you're going to hear it more and more.
[02:42:52.971 --> 02:42:58.753]  Unrealistic optimism is maintained in the face of reality, this story says.
[02:42:58.753 --> 02:43:05.254]  I had not really heard this term before, unrealistic optimism, and now we're seeing it as the title of a neuroscience article.
[02:43:05.254 --> 02:43:06.914]  I think that's quite fascinating.
[02:43:06.914 --> 02:43:20.017]  But in terms of practical aspects here, Mike, it seems like the, excuse me, the key issue is how do we balance this in our own lives so that we can maintain optimism where it's required to keep moving forward?
[02:43:20.817 --> 02:43:27.160]  And yet not be hoodwinked into a state of denial about what's really happening in the world around us.
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:29.321]  Do you have any tips on that balance?
[02:43:29.321 --> 02:43:29.702]  I do.
[02:43:29.702 --> 02:43:35.024]  The principle is to learn to manage your own emotions and your own anxiety.
[02:43:35.024 --> 02:43:36.105]  To look at the truth.
[02:43:36.725 --> 02:43:42.590]  Whether it's the truth about what's going on in the country or just the truth about how much money is in your checking account.
[02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:46.854]  To look at that truth is to create anxiety.
[02:43:46.854 --> 02:43:50.777]  I mean there's a lot to be worried about in terms of what's going on.
[02:43:50.777 --> 02:43:57.242]  So the first thing to do is to learn to manage our emotions.
[02:43:57.242 --> 02:43:59.644]  To become more efficient in them.
[02:43:59.644 --> 02:44:03.688]  So the things that scare us, the things that we're uncomfortable with,
[02:44:04.168 --> 02:44:10.653]  To learn to look at those things in a way and get some skills to manage our state.
[02:44:10.653 --> 02:44:19.079]  Because if we can't do that, denial is the tool, the default tool that we'll resort to.
[02:44:19.079 --> 02:44:23.643]  The better we can manage ourselves, the less need we have for denial.
[02:44:23.643 --> 02:44:24.503]  But wait a minute, Mike.
[02:44:24.503 --> 02:44:26.145]  Why should we manage our own emotions?
[02:44:26.145 --> 02:44:30.248]  I thought the government was going to tell us when to be afraid, when to feel patriotic.
[02:44:31.248 --> 02:44:32.950]  When to feel big, when to feel small.
[02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:37.654]  I mean the government tells us how to feel about everything, like this pretext for war.
[02:44:37.654 --> 02:44:48.082]  Obviously I'm being facetious, but it seems like the skill of managing our own emotions is not something that's really widespread throughout populations of the world.
[02:44:48.082 --> 02:44:52.106]  In fact, it's not taught in schools.
[02:44:53.367 --> 02:44:56.210]  Just like how to be in a relationship effectively.
[02:44:56.210 --> 02:45:01.033]  How do you have a healthy, happy partnership or marriage?
[02:45:01.033 --> 02:45:04.376]  How do you control your anxiety?
[02:45:04.376 --> 02:45:08.099]  How do you make goals and plan for them and be efficient?
[02:45:08.099 --> 02:45:09.320]  None of this is taught.
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:16.966]  It's almost as if, Mike, the government does want us just to take their answers for it and follow them blindly.
[02:45:16.966 --> 02:45:18.227]  In other words, perhaps
[02:45:19.007 --> 02:45:27.554]  The greatest propaganda for unrealistic optimism and the denial that goes with it are the messages we get in the mainstream media.
[02:45:27.554 --> 02:45:36.181]  And so, learning to manage yourself, to me, is the first step toward taking an independent stand.
[02:45:38.166 --> 02:45:42.290]  Mike, this is a really good analysis you're offering us, and I have more questions for you.
[02:45:42.290 --> 02:45:46.574]  But first, do you have a website where people can learn more or see more of what you've written?
[02:45:46.574 --> 02:45:47.995]  Sure.
[02:45:47.995 --> 02:45:53.520]  My website is inlpcenter.com.
[02:45:54.386 --> 02:46:07.739]  Okay, inlpcenter.com, Mike Bundrent is our guest here to give us some analysis of this study of, quote, unrealistic optimism that was published in Nature Neuroscience.
[02:46:07.739 --> 02:46:09.661]  Now, my question for you, Mike, is
[02:46:10.362 --> 02:46:16.086]  How do you think these other factors might play into this phenomenon that we are discussing here?
[02:46:16.086 --> 02:46:31.737]  For example, consuming fluoride, which we know numbs the mind, taking psychiatric medications, which we also know can cause just craziness in the brain, all kinds, you know, suicidal thoughts, even taking action on things like that.
[02:46:31.737 --> 02:46:33.699]  What about the toxic food additives?
[02:46:34.159 --> 02:46:35.020]  That's actually a very good term.
[02:46:35.020 --> 02:46:35.720]  It's actually a very good term.
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:41.483]  Every chemical that we put into our body is either going to help us or hurt us play a role in supporting our organs or not.
[02:46:41.483 --> 02:46:42.924]  And the brain, of course,
[02:47:03.072 --> 02:47:03.592]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:47:19.941 --> 02:47:20.821]  More difficult.
[02:47:20.821 --> 02:47:26.224]  It'll feel sort of like digging through sludge a little bit.
[02:47:26.224 --> 02:47:27.684]  Is it impossible?
[02:47:27.684 --> 02:47:29.185]  Of course not.
[02:47:29.185 --> 02:47:36.148]  If you're taking some sort of medication or if you eat a lot of chemicals, does that mean you're a total zombie?
[02:47:36.148 --> 02:47:37.168]  No, of course not.
[02:47:37.168 --> 02:47:40.649]  You're not as sharp as you might be.
[02:47:40.649 --> 02:47:46.672]  But the key for everybody, no matter where you are, is to get started.
[02:47:47.543 --> 02:47:50.165]  Learn some ways to manage your mind.
[02:47:50.165 --> 02:47:52.467]  Learn some ways to reduce your anxiety.
[02:47:52.467 --> 02:47:55.310]  Learn how to think more clearly.
[02:47:55.310 --> 02:48:11.264]  Everybody, no matter where you're at right now, can, in the next week or two, learn to think several degrees more clearly, to learn to manage their emotions with two or three percent more efficiency, and to feel just a little bit better.
[02:48:11.844 --> 02:48:15.325]  Simply by practicing, let's say, meditation.
[02:48:15.325 --> 02:48:19.686]  Simply by, you know, practicing some cognitive behavioral techniques.
[02:48:19.686 --> 02:48:22.746]  Everybody can take a step forward.
[02:48:22.746 --> 02:48:24.287]  It doesn't matter where you are.
[02:48:24.287 --> 02:48:31.268]  And the ideal, of course, is to become self-sufficient, where you don't need medication in order to feel okay.
[02:48:31.268 --> 02:48:31.708]  Right.
[02:48:31.708 --> 02:48:32.588]  And you're aware.
[02:48:32.588 --> 02:48:40.190]  You're able to be aware of what's going on with the food supply and the water supply, so that you can take measures to avoid it.
[02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:41.290]  And there are ways to do that.
[02:48:42.694 --> 02:48:47.017]  Just extraordinary information, and I hope those of you listening here are really getting this.
[02:48:47.017 --> 02:48:54.662]  This is explaining the brain defect of those who can't see reality and who maintain what we're now calling zombie optimism.
[02:48:54.662 --> 02:48:55.903]  But I want to be clear about this.
[02:48:55.903 --> 02:48:59.145]  We're not opposed to optimism itself.
[02:48:59.145 --> 02:49:01.066]  In fact, I consider myself an optimist.
[02:49:01.066 --> 02:49:02.147]  I don't know about you, Mike.
[02:49:02.147 --> 02:49:03.648]  You're probably an optimist, too.
[02:49:03.648 --> 02:49:08.832]  I mean, I maintain optimism on issues like we are going to expose corruption.
[02:49:08.832 --> 02:49:12.354]  We are going to protect the planet in the way that really matters.
[02:49:12.834 --> 02:49:19.818]  Like, I'm optimistic about, I'm going to learn permaculture and practice permaculture and grow more of my own food no matter what.
[02:49:19.818 --> 02:49:22.219]  I don't care what barriers are put in the way.
[02:49:22.219 --> 02:49:24.520]  I'm going to be optimistic about making progress.
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:29.063]  It seems like combining optimism with action is a real strategy for success.
[02:49:29.063 --> 02:49:29.623]  Yes.
[02:49:29.623 --> 02:49:37.888]  Optimism combined with action based on reality is an incredible combination for success.
[02:49:37.888 --> 02:49:38.348]  Absolutely.
[02:49:38.348 --> 02:49:39.428]  I mean, if you think about it,
[02:49:41.713 --> 02:49:47.564]  The odds don't have to be in your favor in order for you to succeed.
[02:49:47.564 --> 02:49:51.472]  So, if I'm going to start a business, we all know that most businesses fail.
[02:49:52.333 --> 02:49:53.054]  Okay.
[02:49:53.054 --> 02:50:00.680]  But if I know that, if I go, wow, nine out of ten businesses fail within the first year of being in business, okay, that's the truth.
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:02.541]  I'm not going to avoid that truth.
[02:50:02.541 --> 02:50:04.383]  I want to start a business anyways.
[02:50:04.383 --> 02:50:13.330]  And given the reality of how difficult it is, I'm going to make a list of everything that I need to do to give myself the best chance of success.
[02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:15.572]  I'm going to do the research on my term well funded.
[02:50:16.294 --> 02:50:17.575]  We're just about to wrap this up.
[02:50:17.575 --> 02:50:18.216]  20 seconds left.
[02:50:18.216 --> 02:50:21.599]  Anything else you want to add as we wrap up this segment with you?
[02:50:21.599 --> 02:50:23.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:37.652]  Even though that there is neuroscience and studies on the brain that show that the brain does certain things in order to create certain outcomes, we can take cognitive control.
[02:50:37.652 --> 02:50:41.936]  We can influence whether or not that frontal lobe shuts down in the face of bad news.
[02:50:42.267 --> 02:50:44.092]  Alright, good information from Mike Bundren.
[02:50:44.092 --> 02:50:45.435]  Thanks for joining us on this segment.
[02:50:45.435 --> 02:50:46.137]  Stay with us here.
[02:50:46.137 --> 02:50:48.803]  We'll be back with more breaking news here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:48.803 --> 02:50:49.084]  Thank you.

[02:51:26.545 --> 02:51:27.266]  Question.
[02:51:27.266 --> 02:51:30.127]  When the next disaster strikes, will you be ready?
[02:51:30.127 --> 02:51:30.767]  Answer.
[02:51:30.767 --> 02:51:31.488]  Yes.
[02:51:31.488 --> 02:51:38.691]  If you have top-quality survival gear from thesurvivalzone.com, these days it's wise to keep a survival kit in your vehicle, home, and office.

[02:52:00.644 --> 02:52:02.145]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:11.030]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:14.473]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:52:14.473 --> 02:52:15.493]  But take heart.
[02:52:15.493 --> 02:52:19.296]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:52:19.296 --> 02:52:24.299]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:52:24.699 --> 02:52:28.542]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:52:28.542 --> 02:52:30.264]  The globalists are scared.
[02:52:30.264 --> 02:52:31.605]  They've overreached.
[02:52:31.605 --> 02:52:35.108]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:54:13.808 --> 02:54:21.712]  For those of you who are PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers, we're going to have Pepe Escobar on about the Iran false flag situation.
[02:54:21.712 --> 02:54:23.472]  That news that we have been breaking today.
[02:54:23.472 --> 02:54:25.233]  I still have more details for you on that.
[02:54:25.233 --> 02:54:28.715]  He's an Asia Times reporter, going to be joining us live from Brazil.
[02:54:29.355 --> 02:54:39.600]  That's a big deal, so join in tonight, tune in, watch InfoWars Nightly News, which I'm hosting, by the way, doing double duty here today at the InfoWars studios in Austin.
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:48.185]  Bryce Shonka is also going to be joining us from the Tenth Amendment Center to comment on the Occupy Wall Street protests.
[02:54:48.185 --> 02:54:52.327]  He's got some additional insight and information for you on that.
[02:54:52.327 --> 02:54:55.949]  Also on the Nightly News, we're going to be joined by Dr. David Brownstein.
[02:54:56.869 --> 02:55:00.290]  Who is going to be commenting on this breaking news.
[02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:04.732]  You know how they're attacking the vitamins again in the mainstream media.
[02:55:04.732 --> 02:55:06.453]  You see these headlines all over the place now.
[02:55:06.453 --> 02:55:11.234]  They say multivitamins kill senior citizens.
[02:55:11.234 --> 02:55:16.556]  Well, of course, it's a complete fabrication, a total scientific fraud.
[02:55:16.556 --> 02:55:22.719]  And Dr. Brownstein is going to be explaining to us why that is with specific figures and details.
[02:55:23.659 --> 02:55:29.761]  In Infowars Nightly News broadcasting tonight at 7pm hosted by yours truly.
[02:55:29.761 --> 02:55:32.762]  Man, there's always so much good stuff going on here.
[02:55:32.762 --> 02:55:36.483]  We can have radio for six hours a day and still not cover all the news.
[02:55:36.483 --> 02:55:38.244]  I know Alex feels the same way.
[02:55:39.204 --> 02:55:45.966]  The story we promised earlier from Paul Joseph Watson has now been posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:45.966 --> 02:55:52.568]  Title is, sources, US gives Israel green light for Iran strike.
[02:55:52.568 --> 02:55:55.769]  Oh my, here we go, beating the war drum once again.
[02:55:55.769 --> 02:56:08.253]  Paul Joseph Watson says the Obama administration's fabricated terror plot blamed on Iran represents the green light for an Israeli attack on Iran set to take place within the next two weeks.
[02:56:09.093 --> 02:56:13.981]  Says according to confidential military sources who spoke with Alex Jones.
[02:56:13.981 --> 02:56:14.962]  The story goes on.
[02:56:14.962 --> 02:56:18.047]  You can find the story posted at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:18.047 --> 02:56:21.672]  It goes into some of the details of what is happening behind the scenes.
[02:56:22.958 --> 02:56:43.588]  I bet you the CIA and the FBI are tuning in and listening to this show right now today and they are probably learning some new things because there are factions within every group in government and some factions have put this into play and other factions probably tried to resist it or are trying to stop it and they're shocked just as you are shocked.
[02:56:44.028 --> 02:56:54.275]  Just as we are shocked by this, how so many of the key globalist players in our world are pushing us towards violence and pushing us towards war.
[02:56:54.275 --> 02:56:55.616]  For example, here we go.
[02:56:55.616 --> 02:56:57.938]  Here's a story out of The Guardian.
[02:56:57.938 --> 02:57:06.784]  Headline, Saudis say Iran must quote, pay the price for alleged plot as US resists retaliation.
[02:57:07.765 --> 02:57:10.287]  Again this is published in the Guardian by who is it?
[02:57:10.287 --> 02:57:13.489]  Ewan McCaskill in the Guardian.
[02:57:13.489 --> 02:57:22.235]  Tehran denies it was behind plot to kill Saudi ambassador and says the US is using it to divert attention from problems at home.
[02:57:22.235 --> 02:57:24.277]  That sounds like a pretty good assessment actually.
[02:57:24.937 --> 02:57:29.139]  Iran may be exactly right on this particular analysis.
[02:57:29.139 --> 02:57:38.904]  Again, I don't agree with the Iranian government and all their policies and so on, but they could very well be right with this particular analysis.
[02:57:38.904 --> 02:57:44.887]  So we're going to learn more about that tonight as we go into the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 p.m.
[02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:49.469]  Some other stories that we did not have time to get to today, but I want to mention to you very briefly,
[02:57:50.029 --> 02:57:51.310]  Some stuff that will blow your mind.
[02:57:51.310 --> 02:57:56.394]  The FDA has approved another new antidepressant drug for dogs.
[02:57:56.394 --> 02:58:08.385]  Yeah, so if your Fido or your Rover is feeling blue or bored, you can now drug them up just like you drug your kids with psychiatric mind-altering drugs.
[02:58:08.385 --> 02:58:09.165]  Just incredible.
[02:58:10.166 --> 02:58:11.527]  All right, well, we're out of time, folks.
[02:58:11.527 --> 02:58:14.310]  Retransmission of this show will begin shortly.
[02:58:14.310 --> 02:58:21.896]  Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Dr. Steve Pachinik, all about the false flag push for war in the Middle East.
[02:58:21.896 --> 02:58:26.640]  Retransmission begins now, and join us tonight with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:27.120]  Thank you.
[02:58:27.120 --> 02:58:27.501]  Take care.
