[00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:06.214]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.975]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.736]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.858]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:17.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.144]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:37.614]  Well, this is set to be one of the most important broadcasts we've ever done.
[00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:40.195]  Things are moving a lot faster than even I thought they could.
[00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:50.720]  Barack Obama came out last night, gave a speech, and if you really listen to what he said, he called for the invasion of Libya.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.804]  And he says that behind the scenes for the last three days, and that was last night, that a international response is being prepared.
[00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:09.784]  The Wall Street Journal, the BBC are reporting that Qaddafi, of course, has nerve gas, mustard gas, scud missiles.
[00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.258]  He's bought a lot of high-tech weapons from the British, particularly.
[00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:25.727]  There's a big scandal going on right now, where the British Prime Minister, of course, traveled with a bunch of arm dealers two days ago to Egypt to immediately start selling more weapons to them.
[00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:32.233]  The British have been the biggest sellers to Qaddafi, while Qaddafi supposedly blew up one of their airliners.
[00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.094]  It's just crazy.
[00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.436]  So, here we are.
[00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:37.037]  Here we are.
[00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:38.506]  All right.
[00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.850]  And all these other nations, in many of them, it's going to get violent.
[00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.951]  There's reports that the West Bank is going to flare up.
[00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:03.391]  Missiles are being fired again.
[00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.552]  Lebanon's going to flare up.
[00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:13.794]  And the situation in Libya is off the charts hardcore right now.
[00:02:13.794 --> 00:02:15.414]  Off the charts hardcore.
[00:02:15.414 --> 00:02:16.695]  I don't have to explain that to you.
[00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:17.155]  You know that.
[00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:23.778]  We're going to be playing, when we come back from break, Obama's speech statement last night.
[00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:25.118]  We're going to be analyzing that.
[00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:29.300]  We're going to be covering this and other important news for the next two hours.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:38.104]  But ladies and gentlemen, we do not want to get involved in Tripoli, in the situation there in Libya.
[00:02:39.977 --> 00:02:41.879]  Qaddafi is armed to the teeth?
[00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.260]  Let those people sort it out.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.543]  But we're already involved because the globalists that run our country are now on record.
[00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:56.410]  It was even in the Washington Post yesterday that the opposition group in Libya launching this is being financed out of Washington.
[00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.393]  And we've had articles covering all that at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:00.393 --> 00:03:04.697]  Does that mean the people don't have a legitimate reason and not want to be under a creepy dictator?
[00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:21.501]  No, I mean, I'm all for them having a revolution if they want to have it, but the people running our nation, five weeks ago, sent ElBaradeen to overthrow their puppet, Hussein Mubarak.
[00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.022]  Now that's happened.
[00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:25.683]  Now the Muslim Brotherhood's taken over.
[00:03:25.683 --> 00:03:27.324]  Gaddafi.
[00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:29.265]  We're now hearing, oh, Al Qaeda's there.
[00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:30.685]  He's now running Al Qaeda.
[00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:31.966]  First, Saddam runs Al Qaeda.
[00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.067]  Gotta be invaded WMDs.
[00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:35.988]  Then, it's,
[00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:38.711]  In Pakistan.
[00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.532]  Before that, the Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan.
[00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:45.813]  Now Al-Qaeda is in Somalia.
[00:03:45.813 --> 00:03:49.014]  Then Al-Qaeda is here, there, everywhere.
[00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:50.634]  It's like a set piece on a chessboard.
[00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:56.716]  They just move the Al-Qaeda chess piece wherever they want to be able to strike, and that allows them to move their pieces into the area.
[00:03:57.878 --> 00:04:01.160]  I mean, this is extremely elementary what we're dealing with here.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.241]  It's the great game, divide and conquer.
[00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:05.543]  But for the public who's not aware of it, they're completely blind.
[00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:07.504]  The general public has no idea.
[00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:09.625]  All they know is Qaddafi, bad man.
[00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:19.992]  Qaddafi is reportedly, we don't know if any of this is true, British Intel has been, of course, previously ran Libya through their puppet king before Qaddafi came to power in the late 60s.
[00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.573]  And they were the ones that said he'd fled to
[00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:24.836]  Venezuela.
[00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:29.198]  And that was done to destabilize it further and embolden the opposition.
[00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:34.141]  And now they're saying he's been strafing and bombing people with helicopters and jets.
[00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.521]  Maybe true.
[00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:37.722]  Certainly not a good thing to do.
[00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:47.327]  But what happens with the thousand plus drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan and other areas killing whole wedding parties of hundreds of people supposedly to kill one bad guy?
[00:04:47.907 --> 00:04:49.328]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:52.670]  The bomber strafe weddings and markets.
[00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.192]  But oh, when Gaddafi does it, it's so horrible.
[00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:57.293]  It's the hypocrisy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:57.293 --> 00:04:58.514]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:00.275]  Charlie Sheen's coming up, too.
[00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:00.755]  Hi, folks.
[00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:04.478]  This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:10.482]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:18.245]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:05:18.245 --> 00:05:23.127]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:31.791]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:35.533]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:05:36.053 --> 00:05:42.815]  As powder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:46.697]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:53.079]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.859]  Thank you.
[00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:16.359]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:20.043]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:21.058 --> 00:06:33.810]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:41.097]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:06:41.758 --> 00:06:52.141]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:56.063]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:06:56.063 --> 00:06:59.164]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:06:59.764 --> 00:07:04.325]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:05.225]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:08.646]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:09.526]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:14.408]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:15.148]  It's true.
[00:07:15.148 --> 00:07:20.029]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.849]  Number 3.
[00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:24.430]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.131]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:29.131]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.892]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:35.574]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:36.374]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:40.516]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:45.558]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:49.739]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:51.520]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.122]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:07:56.582 --> 00:08:05.752]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.752 --> 00:08:08.034]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:23.927]  Well, in case you missed it last night, President Obama gave a speech.
[00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:25.728]  Here's the CNN headline.
[00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:29.851]  Obama condemns Libyan violence, calls for international response.
[00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:40.438]  He said in the days previous to that that they were already behind the scenes preparing the international UN slash NATO response, and that will be military.
[00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:44.460]  That will be Marines from all of the NATO countries.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.123]  That will be Armed Forces, Air Force going into Libya.
[00:08:48.863 --> 00:09:06.519]  With a guy who for 40 plus years has been stockpiling giant amounts of nerve gas, mustard gas, scud missiles, you name it, Egypt's in striking distance, Israel's in striking distance, Italy, I mean this is out of control.
[00:09:07.543 --> 00:09:09.384]  This is crisis creation.
[00:09:09.384 --> 00:09:21.512]  And what have we been saying that the globalists are going to do to basically destabilize the world as a smokescreen for the global depression that they've engineered?
[00:09:21.512 --> 00:09:22.732]  They're going to start a war.
[00:09:22.732 --> 00:09:24.053]  They have a playbook.
[00:09:24.053 --> 00:09:29.517]  They do this over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:38.030]  We've been saying, we don't know where it's going to start, but probably the Middle East, a destabilization campaign that is going to then spread all over the region.
[00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.892]  And it is on record in the Washington Post, it is on record in the Associated Press.
[00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:50.316]  They even admit that the main Libyan opposition leaders that triggered all of this are run out of Washington.
[00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:54.457]  So yeah, they've got to respond to the humanitarian disaster they have triggered.
[00:09:54.457 --> 00:09:55.518]  Again, the people of
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:04.683]  Libya, great rebel, 1776, whatever, self-determination, I'm all for it, against a brutal dictator.
[00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:07.944]  But why would the globalists trigger this at this time?
[00:10:07.944 --> 00:10:10.025]  Not because they want to bring freedom to that region.
[00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:18.629]  They want another war to pump hundreds of billions of dollars in, another invasion, another overthrow to ensure that the dominoes keep falling.
[00:10:19.597 --> 00:10:22.639]  And then they're going to put extremists into power.
[00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:25.220]  They're going to have groups all around.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:31.923]  And again, by extremist, I'm using the term that the establishment uses so the general public knows what I'm talking about.
[00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.104]  Anybody that doesn't want to be occupied.
[00:10:34.104 --> 00:10:38.827]  They're going to put those people in so they can then have a war with them.
[00:10:38.827 --> 00:10:43.049]  And you heard it here from Webster Tarpley, historian.
[00:10:43.973 --> 00:10:49.109]  You heard it here from yours truly, from Paul Watson, from Aaron Dykes.
[00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:49.772]  How do you think
[00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:59.342]  The tiny British Empire dominated more than half of the major countries in the world just 70 years ago.
[00:10:59.342 --> 00:11:13.506]  They wrote manuals, handbooks, on how they'd play one country against another, then take over that next country, then play that country off against the next, or they'd fund rebels in an area as a pretext to come in, or to scare the neighboring country to then join with the British.
[00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.606]  This is how this works.
[00:11:15.606 --> 00:11:17.187]  This is how a little bitty country
[00:11:17.907 --> 00:11:22.970]  Was able to do it, and the French did it, the Spanish did it, the Portuguese did it as well.
[00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.871]  Nobody has ever done it as good as the British.
[00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:45.201]  The British openly, in 1900, 1905, all those years leading up to 1914, the start of World War I, openly said, Germany's rising, they're taking over the world via their advanced technologies and chemistry and all the sciences.
[00:11:46.897 --> 00:11:49.918]  It was called, you know, The Danger of the Rising Germany.
[00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:55.301]  And Britain openly said, we've got to start a war with them now before it's too late or our global empire is going to fail.
[00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:57.082]  We've got to team up with America to do it.
[00:11:58.203 --> 00:12:03.107]  But Americans don't want to be involved, so British intelligence was publicly sent to the U.S.
[00:12:03.107 --> 00:12:05.209]  to buy off politicians.
[00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:13.636]  The Germans ran news headlines, bought out full-page ads saying, don't sail the Lusitania.
[00:12:13.636 --> 00:12:18.361]  It's an auxiliary ship carrying munitions from the U.S.
[00:12:18.361 --> 00:12:19.762]  It's a military ship.
[00:12:19.762 --> 00:12:21.023]  It's flagged military.
[00:12:21.023 --> 00:12:21.904]  We're going to sink it.
[00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.751]  And they told him for two months.
[00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:28.693]  And then when they did sink it, they said, oh my gosh, remember the Lusitania.
[00:12:28.693 --> 00:12:29.573]  We've got to have war.
[00:12:29.573 --> 00:12:41.139]  But before that, the British, through the Black Hand, this is all mainline history, engineered the shooting of Franz Ferdinand, the Archduke of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[00:12:42.549 --> 00:12:43.690]  And it was on.
[00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.952]  And of course the Germans were imperialist and wanted global domination as well.
[00:12:46.952 --> 00:12:52.857]  It's not that they were good and the British were good or the British were bad and the Germans were bad.
[00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:54.238]  It's just what they were.
[00:12:54.238 --> 00:12:54.939]  It's empire.
[00:12:54.939 --> 00:12:56.920]  It's how humans operate.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.283]  It's what the Chinese have tried to do thousands of years ago and regionally.
[00:13:00.283 --> 00:13:02.384]  It's what the Japanese have tried over and over again.
[00:13:02.384 --> 00:13:04.346]  It's what the Arabs have tried with each other.
[00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:07.188]  It's what happened in Mesoamerica with different
[00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:20.493]  Well, the more ancient, the Toltecs and others, but then the Mayan culture developing, and out of that, the Aztecs and others, and whoever was the most cunning, warlike, manipulative, ended up taking over.
[00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:22.876]  This is what empires do.
[00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:23.858]  It's like a tropism!
[00:13:25.114 --> 00:13:26.295]  What's a tropism?
[00:13:26.295 --> 00:13:35.219]  A plant, you plant the seed, it gets sunlight, heat, water, nutrients, it sprouts, it grows, it turns towards the sun.
[00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:36.820]  It doesn't have a brain.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.902]  It's a wild thing that's pre-programmed.
[00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:43.283]  And humans do the same thing over and over again.
[00:13:43.283 --> 00:13:46.925]  That's why it said, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:13:47.847 --> 00:13:52.309]  That's why history is the key to the present and the future.
[00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:57.930]  History, history, history, history, history, history, history.
[00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.692]  And they want the public to be mindless, to be one-dimensional.
[00:14:02.692 --> 00:14:07.354]  And to say, Alex, are you saying Hosni Mubarak's good?
[00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:10.255]  Are you saying Muammar Gaddafi's good?
[00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:10.495]  No!
[00:14:12.615 --> 00:14:17.725]  I'm pointing out that Gaddafi eight years ago made a peace deal with the globalists.
[00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:18.586]  Look what happened to him.
[00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:21.952]  That just allowed infiltration.
[00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:23.274]  He did try to develop his country.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.906]  Compared to some of the people over there, his socialism actually did hand out some of the goodies.
[00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:36.313]  Because when you have an absolute dictator, he doesn't care about, you know, a big government class that's feeding on people.
[00:14:36.313 --> 00:14:38.756]  It was pretty streamlined, but very oppressive.
[00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:41.519]  But he did develop Libya.
[00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.241]  He did disperse a lot of the money.
[00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:44.583]  Still a horrible guy.
[00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:58.381]  But compared to the globalists, not one 100th as cunning and... Muammar Gaddafi found out they were putting AIDS viruses in the vaccines through UN programs, and that was confirmed.
[00:14:58.381 --> 00:15:01.242]  He wouldn't allow them to come in with abortion.
[00:15:01.242 --> 00:15:05.523]  See, these were his people, his cattle.
[00:15:05.523 --> 00:15:11.865]  And I've known some farmers and ranchers that love their prized cows so much, they won't even butcher them.
[00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:21.328]  And they end up just, you know, having hundreds and hundreds, and then I have to finally sell some off because, I mean, I've known farmers and ranchers that go out and pet their cows.
[00:15:21.328 --> 00:15:22.988]  My grandfather was that way.
[00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:30.090]  He had certain cows he'd had for 10, 15 years that were his friends, and he just couldn't sell them.
[00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.211]  But side issue, the point is, it's kind of like that.
[00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:35.212]  I don't like my grandpa liked his cows.
[00:15:35.212 --> 00:15:38.613]  That's what you got with Muammar Gaddafi, okay?
[00:15:38.613 --> 00:15:39.873]  No, you're not going to poison my cows.
[00:15:41.064 --> 00:15:43.306]  Okay, the globalists are like, there are too many cows.
[00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:45.787]  Yes, get rid of some.
[00:15:45.787 --> 00:15:49.670]  China signed on 35 years ago, 36, 37 years ago, to the UN Population Reduction Program.
[00:15:57.694 --> 00:16:01.999]  Now, I'm going to go out to break with this clip of Obama last night.
[00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:10.749]  I'm going to come back and really try to walk through all of this, but this is on record triggered by the same banks that have hijacked our country and hijacked Europe.
[00:16:11.653 --> 00:16:14.755]  I don't want to say it's our government doing it, but it's on record now.
[00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:18.497]  The articles are posted at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:18.497 --> 00:16:21.539]  Mainstream news bragging, oh, America!
[00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:23.980]  No, not America, the globalists, but they say America.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:33.065]  Yes, it's run out of D.C., the opposition group they're going to put in and bring freedom to that region.
[00:16:33.065 --> 00:16:39.989]  But then meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood and all of them are saying, death to Gaddafi, they're going to set up a totally Islamic state, and then the whole cycle will start over again.
[00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:45.281]  And see now, oh my gosh, Gaddafi is strafing his own people.
[00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:50.509]  We've got to invade, meanwhile, over a thousand drones every day.
[00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:57.695]  On record, the Pentagon has said they can kill 200 people if they're getting one person they want, and that that's good collateral damage.
[00:16:57.695 --> 00:16:59.456]  That that is acceptable.
[00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:12.527]  But then Qaddafi has, in many cases, armed CIA-backed globalist intelligence operatives who know how to drive tanks, who know how to use weapon systems, trained attacking military bases,
[00:17:13.248 --> 00:17:14.128]  Good afternoon everybody.
[00:17:14.128 --> 00:17:17.549]  Secretary Clinton and I just concluded a meeting that focused on the ongoing situation in Libya.
[00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:22.930]  Over the last few days, my national security team has been working around the clock
[00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:48.859]  To monitor the situation there and to coordinate with our international partners about a way forward.
[00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:54.344]  First, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens.
[00:17:54.344 --> 00:17:56.546]  That is my highest priority.
[00:17:56.546 --> 00:18:03.272]  In Libya, we've urged our people to leave the country, and the State Department is assisting those in need of support.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:16.188]  Meanwhile, I think all Americans should give thanks to the heroic work that's being done by our Foreign Service officers and the men and women serving in our embassies and consulates around the world.
[00:18:16.188 --> 00:18:21.412]  They represent the very best of our country and its values.
[00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:31.459]  Throughout this period of unrest and upheaval across the region, the United States has maintained a set of core principles which guide our approach.
[00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:33.921]  These principles apply to the situation in Libya.
[00:18:35.128 --> 00:18:41.352]  As I said last week, we strongly condemn the use of violence in Libya.
[00:18:41.352 --> 00:18:49.418]  The American people extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all who have been killed and injured.
[00:18:49.418 --> 00:18:54.662]  The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is unacceptable.
[00:18:54.662 --> 00:19:01.707]  So are threats and orders to shoot peaceful protesters and further punish the people of Libya.
[00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:03.668]  These actions violate international norms
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.262]  And every standard of common decency.
[00:19:08.262 --> 00:19:11.804]  This violence must stop.
[00:19:11.804 --> 00:19:17.167]  The United States also strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people.
[00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:25.312]  That includes the rights of peaceful assembly, free speech, and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny.
[00:19:25.312 --> 00:19:27.253]  These are human rights.
[00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:29.194]  They are not negotiable.
[00:19:29.194 --> 00:19:31.496]  They must be respected in every country.
[00:19:32.196 --> 00:19:32.396]  Okay.
[00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:42.444]  We're gonna go to break, come back and play the rest, but you heard all the buzzwords.
[00:19:42.444 --> 00:19:44.646]  We must speak with one voice.
[00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:47.268]  That means just do whatever we tell you on Liberty.
[00:19:47.268 --> 00:19:48.569]  Sit down and shut up, America.
[00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:49.370]  We're gonna invade this sucker.
[00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.071]  Get ready for body bags.
[00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:02.933]  You really can lose weight while you're sleeping.
[00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:03.854]  Guaranteed.

[00:20:59.966 --> 00:21:02.349]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:04.671]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.671 --> 00:21:07.895]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:13.001]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:17.186]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:19.950]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.734]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.734 --> 00:21:25.638]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.638 --> 00:21:33.250]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.587 --> 00:21:38.969]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:41.810]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.512]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:46.572]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:47.913]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:47.913 --> 00:21:49.413]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:58.914 --> 00:22:05.603]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:13.353]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:21.877]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:26.959]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:35.903]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:37.604]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:42.126]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:47.028 --> 00:22:50.030]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:58.371 --> 00:23:00.952]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:00.952 --> 00:23:01.632]  No kidding!
[00:23:01.632 --> 00:23:06.034]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:23:06.034 --> 00:23:08.775]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:23:08.775 --> 00:23:12.257]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:17.259]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:24.181]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[00:23:24.181 --> 00:23:28.063]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[00:23:28.203 --> 00:23:30.324]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[00:23:30.324 --> 00:23:31.665]  Fit standard mason jars.
[00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:35.048]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.

[00:23:40.892 --> 00:23:41.853]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:06.469]  We won't be left behind.
[00:24:06.469 --> 00:24:13.596]  Our memories live on in Port-au-Prince.
[00:24:13.596 --> 00:24:16.419]  And boy, it's real.
[00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:22.025]  We'll ride again.
[00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:23.947]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:25.809]  I make a living off the land.
[00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:37.337]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and you heard Obama.
[00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:39.501]  They are preparing an international response.
[00:24:40.829 --> 00:24:46.194]  And the press continues to report on it, and the Wall Street Journal says U.S.
[00:24:46.194 --> 00:24:50.437]  fears Tripoli may deploy gas as chaos mounts.
[00:24:50.437 --> 00:24:55.701]  Scud missiles, they think he has nerve gas, mustard gas, he has a lot of other high-tech weapons.
[00:24:55.701 --> 00:25:03.428]  And here are the globalists going into a political atmosphere, a political climate, where the people, a lot of them, do want to revolt.
[00:25:04.484 --> 00:25:29.876]  Against a dictator and they trigger it and now we're facing a desperate dictator with these weapon systems Who's reportedly straight strafing his own people and then Obama is saying we must speak with one voice on this America That means don't say hey, we don't want to invade let them you know, let them have it out themselves but see the globalists through the West through NATO through America through England
[00:25:31.493 --> 00:25:33.314]  And every standard of common decency.
[00:25:33.314 --> 00:25:34.975]  This violence must stop.
[00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:05.541]  The United States also strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people.
[00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:13.684]  That includes the rights of peaceful assembly, free speech, and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny.
[00:26:13.684 --> 00:26:15.645]  These are human rights.
[00:26:15.645 --> 00:26:17.565]  They are not negotiable.
[00:26:17.565 --> 00:26:20.586]  They must be respected in every country.
[00:26:20.586 --> 00:26:25.248]  And they cannot be denied through violence or suppression.
[00:26:25.248 --> 00:26:27.609]  In a volatile situation like this one,
[00:26:28.396 --> 00:26:35.524]  It is imperative that the nations and peoples of the world speak with one voice, and that that has been our focus.
[00:26:35.524 --> 00:26:46.176]  Yesterday, a unanimous UN Security Council sent a clear message that it condemns the violence in Libya, supports accountability for the perpetrators, and stands with the Libyan people.
[00:26:47.233 --> 00:27:00.003]  The same message, by the way, has been delivered by the European Union, the Arab League, the African Union, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and many individual nations.
[00:27:00.003 --> 00:27:10.651]  North and South, East and West, voices are being raised together to oppose suppression and support the rights of the Libyan people.
[00:27:12.227 --> 00:27:19.093]  I've also asked my administration to prepare the full range of options that we have to respond to this crisis.
[00:27:19.093 --> 00:27:30.222]  This includes those actions we may take, and those we will coordinate with our allies and partners, or those that we'll carry out through multilateral institutions.
[00:27:30.222 --> 00:27:41.051]  Like all governments, the Libyan government has a responsibility to refrain from violence, to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those in need, and to respect the rights of its people.
[00:27:42.153 --> 00:27:51.022]  It must be held accountable for its failure to meet those responsibilities and face the cost of continued violations of human rights.
[00:27:51.022 --> 00:27:54.946]  This is not simply a concern of the United States.
[00:27:54.946 --> 00:28:01.993]  The entire world is watching, and we will coordinate our assistance and accountability measures with the international community.
[00:28:02.947 --> 00:28:16.737]  To that end, Secretary Clinton and I have asked Bill Burns, our Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, to make several stops in Europe and the region to intensify our consultations with allies and partners about the situation in Libya.
[00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:24.022]  I've also asked Secretary Clinton to travel to Geneva on Monday, where a number of foreign ministers will convene for a session of the Human Rights Council.
[00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:38.258]  There she'll hold consultations with her counterparts on events throughout the region and continue to ensure that we join with the international community to speak with one voice to the government and the people of Libya.
[00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:43.661]  And even as we are focused on the urgent situation in Libya, let me just say that our efforts
[00:28:44.687 --> 00:28:57.097]  Continue to address the events taking place elsewhere, including how the international community can most effectively support the peaceful transition to democracy in both Tunisia and in Egypt.
[00:28:57.097 --> 00:28:59.038]  Let me be clear.
[00:28:59.038 --> 00:29:06.544]  The change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region.
[00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:10.788]  This change doesn't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power.
[00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:15.631]  It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life.
[00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:17.872]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:29:17.872 --> 00:29:27.478]  It is on record that Google, George Soros, the CIA, the NSA, British Intelligence were all over the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak.
[00:29:27.478 --> 00:29:29.359]  That's not debated now.
[00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:29.759]  It's a fact.
[00:29:31.064 --> 00:29:38.991]  It is not debated that the major opposition forces triggering this in Tripoli and in and around Libya was run out of the West.
[00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:43.115]  And he sat there and said this has nothing to do with foreign powers involved.
[00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:50.741]  That is another lie from the liar-in-chief.
[00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:52.143]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.143 --> 00:29:54.665]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:57.347]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.376 --> 00:30:04.219]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:08.502]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:13.305]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:19.149]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:26.174]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:30:28.949 --> 00:30:35.575]  We're American and be proud.
[00:30:35.575 --> 00:30:38.818]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:30:54.887 --> 00:31:00.471]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:31:00.471 --> 00:31:04.053]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:04.053 --> 00:31:05.174]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:05.174 --> 00:31:09.757]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:09.757 --> 00:31:15.702]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:15.702 --> 00:31:17.843]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:17.843 --> 00:31:20.525]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:31:20.865 --> 00:31:27.371]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:29.573]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:31:29.573 --> 00:31:34.937]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:31:34.937 --> 00:31:40.202]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:45.386]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:31:45.566 --> 00:31:48.767]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:51.769]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:52.529]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:05.260]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.982]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:08.982 --> 00:32:11.423]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.423 --> 00:32:17.286]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.286 --> 00:32:23.529]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:23.949 --> 00:32:29.931]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:34.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.092 --> 00:32:38.393]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.393 --> 00:32:44.334]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.334 --> 00:32:47.895]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:47.895 --> 00:32:49.876]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:49.876 --> 00:32:50.316]  It's here.
[00:32:50.976 --> 00:33:19.164]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv We're continuing to cover this earth-changing information that's unfolding in Libya.
[00:33:20.154 --> 00:33:23.437]  Now, that was a five-minute clip.
[00:33:23.437 --> 00:33:30.883]  We almost aired all of his short statement, his five-and-a-half-minute statement last night, President Barry Sotoro, a.k.a.
[00:33:30.883 --> 00:33:33.846]  Barack Obama.
[00:33:33.846 --> 00:33:37.969]  And I want people to understand what they're openly saying.
[00:33:37.969 --> 00:33:40.591]  They're talking about an invasion.
[00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:42.012]  Now, remember what happened to U.S.
[00:33:42.012 --> 00:33:43.554]  forces in Somalia.
[00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:48.894]  Chronicle the movie Blackhawk down.
[00:33:48.894 --> 00:33:51.396]  What do you think's going to happen?
[00:33:51.396 --> 00:34:01.606]  I know it goes from bad to worse if a international force badly coordinated goes into Libya.
[00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:03.608]  Well, they intend to basically
[00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:11.661]  Stampede Qaddafi into fleeing or cause more of his forces to turn against him.
[00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:25.167]  They know that if a big task force is now being prepared in the Mediterranean goes in there and you notice recently under the Egypt cover more US aircraft carriers came into the med.
[00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:27.247]  So they're all just sitting there waiting.
[00:34:27.247 --> 00:34:30.309]  Now you see the grand chessboard becoming crystal clear.
[00:34:31.329 --> 00:34:34.112]  And now, the invasion can begin.
[00:34:34.112 --> 00:34:48.284]  And the globalists may just be testing to see if they threaten an invasion, and lie and say that he's fled Libya, that that will destabilize him further, and give more power to the opposition to make sure he falls, and then they can come in to render humanitarian aid, i.e.
[00:34:48.284 --> 00:34:51.326]  take over the entire infrastructure.
[00:34:51.326 --> 00:34:57.312]  And the trillions of dollars of oil that are confirmed to be in Libya.
[00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:57.492]  But,
[00:35:02.073 --> 00:35:10.898]  There's a whole nother facet to this that I mentioned earlier, and that is dealing with the strafing.
[00:35:10.898 --> 00:35:26.206]  And Kurt Nimmo wrote a story about this last night, so did one of our other great writers, dealing with the fact that thousands and thousands of people a year are killed by the thousand plus drones operating in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and other areas of North Africa.
[00:35:26.206 --> 00:35:28.648]  And they just fly around with Hellfire missiles on them,
[00:35:30.815 --> 00:35:42.542]  Their favorite target is a wedding because they can get a bunch of people together and they'll drop one bomb into the middle of it, killing 120, 150, 200 in some cases or more people.
[00:35:42.542 --> 00:35:44.323]  You've seen it in the news.
[00:35:44.323 --> 00:35:46.664]  And our media says, well, that's reasonable.
[00:35:46.664 --> 00:35:49.686]  There were two terrorists out of the 150 people.
[00:35:49.686 --> 00:35:52.788]  And that's acceptable.
[00:35:52.788 --> 00:35:58.431]  I mean, we've seen cases of where our military has bombed entire apartment
[00:35:59.537 --> 00:36:03.118]  Complexes to kill one person and and that's good.
[00:36:03.118 --> 00:36:13.222]  That's that's freedom But when Qaddafi reportedly does it we don't know if that's true probably is he's fighting desperately for his dictatorship Then it's oh my gosh.
[00:36:13.222 --> 00:36:14.242]  We're so outraged.
[00:36:14.242 --> 00:36:15.243]  This is terrible.
[00:36:15.243 --> 00:36:21.945]  It's kind of like when we hear reports of Foreign governments torturing people and it's oh this is so terrible.
[00:36:21.945 --> 00:36:22.945]  This is so dark.
[00:36:22.945 --> 00:36:25.927]  This is so evil we need to invade
[00:36:28.697 --> 00:36:38.044]  This country or that country, we need to go into Sudan because the Muslims in the north, they get the Christians and they torture them.
[00:36:38.044 --> 00:36:41.446]  They get the Christian soldiers and they torture them.
[00:36:41.446 --> 00:36:44.428]  They pull their fingernails out.
[00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:45.189]  They beat them.
[00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:53.910]  But then when our government comes out and Rumsfeld says, yeah, we're taking off the gloves, yeah, we're torturing, and the White House memos, it's like, good!
[00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.717]  That's what Jack Bauer does on 24, man, that's getting tough!
[00:36:59.651 --> 00:37:08.595]  It's getting tough strafing and bombing big crowds and markets and people meeting for weddings or people fishing by side of a river.
[00:37:08.595 --> 00:37:10.516]  What the Pentagon put out last year?
[00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:12.597]  Unknown terrorist will now be targeted.
[00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:13.857]  In fact, people won't believe that.
[00:37:13.857 --> 00:37:16.418]  Google unknown terrorist.
[00:37:16.418 --> 00:37:19.880]  No-name terrorist will now be targeted by drones.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.101]  And it says in Pakistan and Afghanistan
[00:37:23.101 --> 00:37:26.042]  We don't even have to know their name or know exactly who they are.
[00:37:26.042 --> 00:37:42.108]  If they look like a terrorist, a guy with a turban on and a gown on, with an AK-47, we're going to go ahead and drop a $300,000 missile on them.
[00:37:42.108 --> 00:37:45.049]  No-name terrorists now being targeted in drone attacks.
[00:37:45.049 --> 00:37:47.910]  I think that was MSNBC and Associated Press.
[00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.650]  Let's see if I'm right.
[00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.331]  That was about a year ago, maybe even two.
[00:37:51.795 --> 00:37:55.277]  Again, think about the hypocrisy.
[00:37:55.277 --> 00:37:59.320]  When the globalists that run our country torture, it's good.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:06.964]  When the globalists that run our country spy on us without warrants, right out of East Germany, or 1984, it's good.
[00:38:06.964 --> 00:38:09.746]  When the globalists strafe and kill people, it's good.
[00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:10.987]  When they do all of this, it's wonderful.
[00:38:11.755 --> 00:38:18.798]  But then when somebody else reportedly does it, it is the most horrible thing in the world.
[00:38:18.798 --> 00:38:20.579]  It is, oh, it's horrible.
[00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:25.781]  We've all got to be of one voice together right now and condemn this.
[00:38:25.781 --> 00:38:27.382]  You know, some say that
[00:38:28.658 --> 00:38:31.919]  Sometimes the Libyans torture people.
[00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:39.000]  And we're like, well, here's army manuals from Vietnam on how to torture, including hooking electrodes to men and women's genitals.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.121]  Well, that's patriotic.
[00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:41.121]  That's very patriotic.
[00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:41.821]  That's good.
[00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:43.981]  Yeah, but you just said torture was wrong.
[00:38:43.981 --> 00:38:47.522]  Well, it's wrong when them people with brown skin do it.
[00:38:47.522 --> 00:38:50.503]  But when we do it, it's patriot.
[00:38:50.503 --> 00:38:51.143]  It's patriot.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:12.434]  And then, of course, the fool's errand people that get into all of this and sit there watching shock and awe, devastation in Iraq as whole high-rise buildings are bombed with 4,000-pound salvos.
[00:39:12.434 --> 00:39:22.842]  I've talked to pizza place owners, liquor store owners over the years, and they've told me, because I'd already noticed it, that
[00:39:23.914 --> 00:39:27.977]  Holidays aren't the biggest time for liquor and pizza orders.
[00:39:27.977 --> 00:39:29.539]  Things that are seen as celebratory.
[00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:31.320]  The Super Bowl isn't even.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.183]  It's when a new war is launched, and CNN and Fox are covering it.
[00:39:35.183 --> 00:39:39.007]  Every good old boy pulls in, gets their favorite liquor.
[00:39:39.007 --> 00:39:43.911]  They buy steaks, they go in, they cook it up, and they feel so manly.
[00:39:43.911 --> 00:39:45.012]  It's like a video game.
[00:39:45.012 --> 00:39:47.474]  Yeah, look at that building blow up!
[00:39:47.474 --> 00:39:48.074]  Woo!
[00:39:48.074 --> 00:39:49.956]  Boy, I'm feeling good right now!
[00:39:52.259 --> 00:40:08.293]  And they all get their little American flags and they put them on their cars and they drive around while the group that's attacking those countries, those innocent countries, and killing in Iraq at least a million people as a result of it.
[00:40:08.293 --> 00:40:16.000]  Don't you understand the globalists see you as just as worthless as an Iraqi or a Libyan or an Egyptian or a North Vietnamese?
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.581]  And it's getting crazy.
[00:40:23.581 --> 00:40:35.788]  Again, Obama condemns Libyan violence, calls for international response, and says that in the days previous they are preparing to intervene with military force.
[00:40:35.788 --> 00:40:41.292]  And they go on and say because they're abusing the democracy protesters.
[00:40:41.292 --> 00:40:47.435]  Yeah, when you saw footage in Bahrain where they were actually shooting unarmed people with flags, that's one thing.
[00:40:47.435 --> 00:40:50.557]  But what do you think would happen in the US if
[00:40:51.818 --> 00:40:57.904]  You and 10 of your buddies went and tried to attack the front gate at a major military base.
[00:40:57.904 --> 00:41:03.529]  Within seconds, machine guns would open up on you.
[00:41:03.529 --> 00:41:06.191]  I mean, that's a fact.
[00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:08.934]  That's a stated default position.
[00:41:08.934 --> 00:41:17.842]  So if you look carefully, in all the cases where Qaddafi, reportedly, we know it's true, has bombed and strafed people, it's when they're using commandeered tanks
[00:41:19.229 --> 00:41:23.512]  To run over fences and invade military bases of a dictator.
[00:41:23.512 --> 00:41:24.513]  What do you think he's gonna do?
[00:41:24.513 --> 00:41:25.393]  I'm not saying it's good.
[00:41:25.393 --> 00:41:31.858]  What do you think our government would do if we try to take over military bases?
[00:41:31.858 --> 00:41:36.381]  I mean, this is total and complete hypocrisy.
[00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:40.984]  And he's got chemical weapons.
[00:41:40.984 --> 00:41:44.206]  And by the way, the evidence is now clear.
[00:41:44.206 --> 00:41:47.449]  In 1991, Saddam Hussein did fire off chemicals.
[00:41:48.884 --> 00:41:52.847]  And to get rid of the evidence, it was all videotaped by the marine demolition teams.
[00:41:52.847 --> 00:41:54.287]  It's online.
[00:41:54.287 --> 00:41:54.888]  The U.S.
[00:41:54.888 --> 00:41:57.209]  markings, the Russian markings, but mainly U.S.
[00:41:57.209 --> 00:42:00.251]  in the Camasilla and hundreds of other dumps.
[00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:01.432]  It was one of the biggest.
[00:42:01.432 --> 00:42:02.632]  And they blew them up.
[00:42:02.632 --> 00:42:11.918]  In fact, the news thought that nukes were going off because it was creating such big mushroom clouds and they blew up giant ammo depots with sarin
[00:42:14.508 --> 00:42:16.350]  Warhead tips.
[00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:26.317]  And then all of the troops, they wore tape on their uniforms, they wore tape on their tanks, and on their Humvees, and on their Bradley fighting vehicles.
[00:42:26.317 --> 00:42:28.079]  It's white tape with black stripes down it.
[00:42:29.707 --> 00:42:32.070]  White tape with black stripes down it.
[00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:36.134]  And it's white when there's not a chemical weapon, it gets stripes when there are.
[00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:45.343]  And the chemical weapon detectors, the fancy ones in Humvees went off, that were actual chemical sensors, the tape all got stripes.
[00:42:45.343 --> 00:42:49.728]  And they came on the news and said those were all false.
[00:42:49.728 --> 00:42:52.271]  False positives, your tape malfunctioned.
[00:42:54.321 --> 00:43:00.423]  And then we saw the congressional hearings of them wheeling in Marine Corps captains and colonels and others in wheelchairs.
[00:43:00.423 --> 00:43:01.944]  Remember all that footage?
[00:43:01.944 --> 00:43:05.866]  And army officers saying, I believed in my country!
[00:43:05.866 --> 00:43:07.686]  Now I'm dying!
[00:43:07.686 --> 00:43:10.227]  The nerve gas!
[00:43:10.227 --> 00:43:18.210]  And then, remember, it came out years later, they did autopsies on the thousands and thousands that died, and their brain stems were full of sarin!
[00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.651]  The globalists knew full well, they're like,
[00:43:20.438 --> 00:43:20.938]  Well, the U.N.
[00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:23.439]  Weapon Inspectors are about to come in here after we take it over.
[00:43:23.439 --> 00:43:26.539]  We gotta blow all this stuff up we sold them.
[00:43:26.539 --> 00:43:33.500]  And so they blow up over a hundred, and I've had Dr. Doug Rocky, who was involved in it, head of the D.U.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.121]  program, on.
[00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:38.701]  Most of his team is dead or dying.
[00:43:38.701 --> 00:43:42.082]  What is it, 20 years later?
[00:43:42.082 --> 00:43:44.923]  And he's corrected me when I said dozens of large bases.
[00:43:44.923 --> 00:43:46.403]  He said, no, it was over a hundred.
[00:43:46.986 --> 00:43:48.627]  Blowing them up.
[00:43:48.627 --> 00:43:54.731]  Sending demolition teams in with old, rotten, plastic hazmat gear.
[00:43:54.731 --> 00:43:56.872]  That stuff isn't brand new and perfect, folks.
[00:43:56.872 --> 00:43:57.773]  You're deader than a hammer.
[00:43:57.773 --> 00:43:58.574]  It'll soft kill you.
[00:43:58.574 --> 00:44:02.796]  If you don't drop dead right there, it'll soft kill you later.
[00:44:02.796 --> 00:44:04.617]  But do they want to give healthcare to all those people?
[00:44:04.617 --> 00:44:05.218]  Absolutely not.
[00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:14.631]  And so if you look at the numbers of birth defects, it's triple to quadruple depending on the service you look at.
[00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:21.514]  It's 15 times the world average for deformities in places like Fallujah.
[00:44:21.514 --> 00:44:28.517]  So there's Serin, VX, Mustard.
[00:44:28.517 --> 00:44:29.518]  The list goes on and on.
[00:44:30.737 --> 00:44:32.138]  Blown up!
[00:44:32.138 --> 00:44:36.360]  But the frontline troops who blew it up, they were at least in rotten.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.181]  You know how water hoses get old and break up?
[00:44:38.181 --> 00:44:39.061]  Well, same with the plastic.
[00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:42.923]  I've talked to so many troops, seen the video, where they just put them on, they would rip in minutes walking.
[00:44:44.895 --> 00:44:46.416]  Gas masks that didn't work.
[00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:48.677]  And they tell them, all right, get back two miles.
[00:44:48.677 --> 00:44:49.638]  We're going to detonate it.
[00:44:49.638 --> 00:44:52.519]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:44:52.519 --> 00:44:53.940]  Mushroom cloud.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.522]  Chemical weapons detectors all over the region.
[00:44:57.522 --> 00:44:58.763]  Alert, alert, alert.
[00:44:58.763 --> 00:44:59.403]  Don't worry.
[00:44:59.403 --> 00:45:03.706]  No, there's no nerve gas.
[00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:11.530]  But go ahead and get in your hazmat suits in 130 degree weather.
[00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.011]  And so the troops were soft killed.
[00:45:14.525 --> 00:45:22.392]  And the Pentagon, the lawsuits have been filed, the documents the last 20 years have come out, that they full well knew what was happening.
[00:45:22.392 --> 00:45:24.214]  Because there'd been a change in policy.
[00:45:24.214 --> 00:45:25.936]  So what if the troops breathe nerve gas?
[00:45:25.936 --> 00:45:29.279]  We'll just say, you know, that they died of natural causes.
[00:45:29.279 --> 00:45:34.123]  So what if they die a week later, a year later, five years later, 20 years later?
[00:45:34.123 --> 00:45:39.288]  So what every time they do an autopsy that the brainstem is filled with sarin?
[00:45:41.104 --> 00:45:47.629]  Why do you think most of these men and women who believe they were fighting for America get neurological disorders?
[00:45:47.629 --> 00:45:51.953]  And then they'll just give them a name for it and say, oh, no, you naturally got this.
[00:45:51.953 --> 00:46:00.760]  But then good scientists, good coroners ask the widows, may we look at your husband's brain before you bury him, before you embalm him?
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.601]  And they say, sure.
[00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:03.602]  In some cases, women as well.
[00:46:03.602 --> 00:46:08.006]  There's been congressional hearings on this, and they go in and take their poor little brain out, and it's shriveled.
[00:46:08.746 --> 00:46:08.946]  I think
[00:46:26.956 --> 00:46:40.687]  Uh, highest concentrations in brainstem, and when they'd go in, you know, guys who could bench press 350 pounds, perfect shape, you know, captains, colonels, you name it, tough guys, they're like, uh, my muscles all dissolved and I'm shaking, and they're like, you're fine.
[00:46:40.687 --> 00:46:46.191]  A month later, they're in a wheelchair, help me, help me, please help me!
[00:46:46.191 --> 00:46:50.695]  They're like, there's nothing wrong with you, time for you to go in the casket now!
[00:46:53.655 --> 00:46:56.056]  Or the teams that had to clean up the DU, like Doug Rocky.
[00:46:56.056 --> 00:47:02.339]  Rashes all over him, vomiting, diarrhea for years, teeth falling out, his men dying around him.
[00:47:02.339 --> 00:47:06.620]  He's had 30 plus surgeries.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.001]  The guy's like Darth Vader now.
[00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:15.664]  He's having surgeries almost every month, a battle, and the cancer's being removed, and kidney surgery, and liver.
[00:47:15.664 --> 00:47:18.425]  But he still comes on this show and fights and travels all over the country.
[00:47:18.425 --> 00:47:23.167]  During the breaks he's, he gets back on air, man's up, you can't even tell, the guy's dying.
[00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:26.903]  I don't
[00:47:51.257 --> 00:47:54.439]  And they just write him off, just write him off.
[00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:59.062]  And why have I told you this historical account?
[00:47:59.062 --> 00:48:09.168]  Because they'll send NATO, UN, US troops into Tripoli, and there's a good chance he's going to fire off a bunch of Scuds and a bunch of artillery.
[00:48:09.168 --> 00:48:14.551]  And when that nerve gas hits the general population, it's going to kill them.
[00:48:14.551 --> 00:48:17.733]  And when the troops get hit with it, if any of it gets through their suit,
[00:48:18.641 --> 00:48:23.404]  It's gonna kill him, maybe a week, maybe 10 years, but it's gonna kill you.
[00:48:23.404 --> 00:48:27.347]  And when it kills you, they're gonna say, sit down and shut up.
[00:48:27.347 --> 00:48:29.948]  Nothing's wrong with you.
[00:48:29.948 --> 00:48:34.411]  And nobody's gonna talk about who sold Muammar Gaddafi most of his chemical weapons.
[00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:39.495]  It's on record, the British are the biggest sellers to him.
[00:48:39.495 --> 00:48:44.458]  He's got a high-tech weapons arsenal compared to even Saddam Hussein.
[00:48:46.854 --> 00:48:52.676]  Saddam Hussein had a pretty powerful arsenal, but it was badly coordinated until the 1991 war when it was almost all destroyed.
[00:48:52.676 --> 00:48:54.717]  He had almost nothing by 2003.
[00:48:54.717 --> 00:49:02.560]  The inspectors had been there for 13 years, 12 years, tearing everything up.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.781]  Qaddafi's been there since the late 1960s.
[00:49:05.781 --> 00:49:07.861]  What, 1968?
[00:49:07.861 --> 00:49:09.262]  Qaddafi's had all that oil money.
[00:49:09.262 --> 00:49:12.043]  Qaddafi has got that place ringed as a ring of death.
[00:49:12.952 --> 00:49:20.954]  And the CIA and the globalists may control the mob in the street, a lot of them have legitimate beefs, but now they're going to have to dig out the military.
[00:49:20.954 --> 00:49:32.257]  What they're hoping is that as the fleet prepares to invade and start bombarding his hardened emplacements, that they can knock out those weapons, but they're still going to leak.
[00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:44.587]  And they're hoping that his military defects and then he falls that way and then the international I-4 force that by the way was in the Ottawa Citizen two days ago.
[00:49:44.587 --> 00:49:47.409]  They're preparing an I-4 international force for the U.S.
[00:49:47.409 --> 00:49:48.790]  and Canada.
[00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.091]  I tell you man, they have got this whole thing.
[00:49:51.091 --> 00:50:01.297]  One day when we have a big war with Mexico and the Globalist and the Ford Foundation trigger the Mecha La Raza teams that they've got in this country for unrest.
[00:50:02.113 --> 00:50:09.035]  And don't worry though, the International Stabilization Force is gonna stop the ethnic warfare, just like in Serbia.
[00:50:09.035 --> 00:50:11.456]  This is how the globalists operate.
[00:50:11.456 --> 00:50:14.097]  So I'm gonna tell the military something again.
[00:50:14.097 --> 00:50:27.581]  Last year, AP and Bloomberg reported, we covered it ad nauseum, that in 1999, they signed a secret deal with the VA to keep their people in the dark,
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:34.424]  And to take the death benefits of World War II vets right through current vets.
[00:50:34.424 --> 00:50:44.751]  So that when your husband or wife who's been putting money into that life insurance policy dies, they send you a fast one and say sign this form and then you sign it and then you never get any money.
[00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:46.452]  It says sign this form to get your money.
[00:50:46.452 --> 00:50:47.913]  The government allows them to do that.
[00:50:47.913 --> 00:50:49.134]  It tricks you and then you don't get the money.
[00:50:50.609 --> 00:50:57.855]  Folks, they're robbing the veterans death benefits they paid for, their insurance policies.
[00:50:57.855 --> 00:51:01.238]  They let them breathe nerve gas and die and don't give them aid.
[00:51:01.238 --> 00:51:05.922]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:05.922 --> 00:51:10.406]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers.

[00:52:01.763 --> 00:52:05.784]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.784 --> 00:52:09.025]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:14.185]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:14.185 --> 00:52:20.207]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.207 --> 00:52:22.447]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:23.307]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:23.807]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:24.607]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.607 --> 00:52:25.768]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.768 --> 00:52:28.008]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.912 --> 00:52:44.034]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.034 --> 00:52:49.179]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:52:49.179 --> 00:52:58.307]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:03.365]  This is not a drill.
[00:53:03.365 --> 00:53:03.905]  Repeat!
[00:53:03.905 --> 00:53:05.886]  This is not a drill.
[00:53:05.886 --> 00:53:07.786]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:53:07.786 --> 00:53:14.987]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:53:14.987 --> 00:53:19.388]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:53:19.388 --> 00:53:29.710]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:31.531]  Under any circumstance.
[00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:38.756]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:53:38.756 --> 00:53:39.456]  But listen up.
[00:53:39.456 --> 00:53:45.700]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.542]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:47.542 --> 00:53:49.703]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:49.703 --> 00:53:50.203]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:53:50.203 --> 00:53:52.085]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:53:52.085 --> 00:53:52.685]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:52.685 --> 00:53:53.265]  Right now.
[00:54:19.269 --> 00:54:21.170]  A few program notes here.
[00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:26.151]  Charlie Sheen is on during the third hour today.
[00:54:26.151 --> 00:54:27.032]  He's a friend of mine.
[00:54:27.032 --> 00:54:29.132]  I asked the audience to pray for him.
[00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:32.834]  He's been a frequent guest in the last six years here on the show.
[00:54:32.834 --> 00:54:36.635]  He's a good guy who'd been sober off and on almost completely for a decade.
[00:54:37.395 --> 00:54:54.834]  All the times I've spent with him, all he does is research the news and give to charity, and spend time with his family, and doesn't drink, didn't ever use drugs, and then he got in with some folks and kind of fell off the wagon, but he is clean.
[00:54:55.779 --> 00:55:09.411]  When I was out at his house, and I can talk about it now because other people have already talked about it, it's on record, but I mean, you know, they had his counselors there and he just wanted his friends there to, you know, help him and his baseball buddies and people and other Hollywood folks.
[00:55:09.411 --> 00:55:15.116]  And he's just exercising every day at seven in the morning.
[00:55:15.116 --> 00:55:17.037]  He's sometimes a couple times a day.
[00:55:17.037 --> 00:55:20.760]  He's putting on weight.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.423]  But in the six and a half years I've known Charlie,
[00:55:24.878 --> 00:55:26.623]  He's got the most energy I've ever seen.
[00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:29.410]  And I've noticed it's the same way with myself.
[00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:33.380]  Only a few times have I completely kicked coffee.
[00:55:34.178 --> 00:55:35.859]  Which is a powerful drug.
[00:55:35.859 --> 00:55:37.881]  And about a week after, I'm totally tired for a week.
[00:55:37.881 --> 00:55:40.403]  A week later, my brain works so much better.
[00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:43.165]  I have so much more energy.
[00:55:43.165 --> 00:55:45.727]  Dozens of times I've kicked tobacco.
[00:55:45.727 --> 00:55:48.589]  Started playing baseball with friends when I was like 10, 11, 12.
[00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:54.654]  And by 12, they'd have their brothers, Levi Garrett, Redman, chewing tobacco.
[00:55:54.654 --> 00:55:57.676]  And I would try to do what was cool and get sick the first few times.
[00:55:57.676 --> 00:55:59.298]  And pretty soon, you want that chewing tobacco.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:08.444]  Pretty soon you're like, hey, can I give your brother $5 because he's old enough, you know, he's 18 to go buy me some, uh, some, some Redman.
[00:56:08.444 --> 00:56:10.586]  And I mean, it's a horrible drug.
[00:56:10.586 --> 00:56:16.569]  So, I mean, can I sit here and judge Rush Limbaugh when he got totally addicted on synthetic heroin, Oxycontin?
[00:56:16.569 --> 00:56:16.709]  No!
[00:56:17.409 --> 00:56:18.290]  People were attacking him.
[00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.432]  I said, the guy had a bunch of back surgeries.
[00:56:20.432 --> 00:56:21.773]  You know, people have car wrecks.
[00:56:21.773 --> 00:56:26.177]  People, people have things happen to them and they get addicted to things.
[00:56:26.177 --> 00:56:32.102]  The few times I've had to take pain pills, it makes me throw up so I can never use opiates.
[00:56:32.102 --> 00:56:34.425]  But some people, boy, it's like a light switch goes off.
[00:56:34.425 --> 00:56:37.628]  They're like, man, this is for me.
[00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:39.029]  I don't judge Rush Limbaugh for that.
[00:56:42.828 --> 00:56:46.651]  I judge people for doing consciously evil things to hurt other people.
[00:56:46.651 --> 00:56:52.034]  Evil are folks that enjoy hurting people, that get into it.
[00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:59.780]  That, you know, oh, kill a million Iraqis, that's not a sin, but Charlie Sheen started taking some drugs and drinking again.
[00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:08.626]  I mean, you know, King David had his best friend murdered so he could have his wife.
[00:57:08.626 --> 00:57:13.070]  And then King David got on his knees and truly repented and his heart was right.
[00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:17.194]  And God said, you're a man after my own heart.
[00:57:17.194 --> 00:57:19.836]  Again, it's the heart that matters.
[00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:25.241]  And I just want people, the issue is Charlie is pretty wild.
[00:57:26.402 --> 00:57:43.223]  I mean, he has so much energy now, working out a couple times a day most days, you know, eating good food, you know, drinking, you know, stuff like Interfoods and other brandy, you know, that green food that has all the superfoods in it, all the super shakes.
[00:57:43.223 --> 00:57:44.785]  I mean, the guy is super smart.
[00:57:46.127 --> 00:57:51.490]  And I was talking to him a few weeks ago and I was at his house and I was like, is this true about this woman?
[00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.450]  No, never matter.
[00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.291]  Is this true about this suitcase full of cocaine?
[00:57:55.291 --> 00:57:55.972]  He goes, no.
[00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:57.512]  Was it true blood was shooting out of your nose?
[00:57:57.512 --> 00:57:58.293]  No.
[00:57:58.293 --> 00:57:59.073]  And he doesn't lie to me.
[00:57:59.073 --> 00:58:00.013]  He doesn't lie.
[00:58:00.013 --> 00:58:02.134]  He's brutally honest.
[00:58:02.134 --> 00:58:05.296]  And we went over it all and I said, you got to defend yourself.
[00:58:05.856 --> 00:58:08.939]  Then he said, when I do, they just spin it anyways.
[00:58:08.939 --> 00:58:10.941]  He says, yeah, some of it's true.
[00:58:10.941 --> 00:58:13.483]  Most of it's exaggerated, but I'm clean now.
[00:58:13.483 --> 00:58:16.105]  And I want people to leave me alone.
[00:58:16.105 --> 00:58:18.648]  And he said, so just let them say what lies they want.
[00:58:18.648 --> 00:58:24.593]  But then I was talking to him last week and he said, you know what, let's just go ahead and do the interview.
[00:58:24.593 --> 00:58:26.074]  And so he's going to be all over the map.
[00:58:29.073 --> 00:58:30.074]  I mean, he's wild, folks.
[00:58:30.074 --> 00:58:35.057]  He just starts spewing really powerful poetry right off the top of his head.
[00:58:35.057 --> 00:58:39.119]  I mean, he is really a dynamic guy, and he's gonna be on with us.
[00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:48.085]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.626 --> 00:58:52.267]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:59:53.528 --> 00:59:55.908]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.908 --> 00:59:58.689]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.112]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:11.693]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.693 --> 01:00:13.233]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.233 --> 01:00:17.435]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.435 --> 01:00:21.517]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:38.492]  Big new developments on the domino effect in the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:00:38.492 --> 01:00:41.133]  Africa News reporting.
[01:00:41.133 --> 01:00:45.596]  Benghazi units prepare to liberate Tripoli.
[01:00:45.596 --> 01:00:48.238]  In liberated East Libya, people are
[01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:59.755]  Got to love how that's phrased.
[01:00:59.755 --> 01:01:01.636]  Yeah, it is government terror.
[01:01:01.636 --> 01:01:06.179]  But the point is he's being overthrown so the globalists can have a new war and try to invade the country.
[01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:17.867]  Benghazi, Libya's second city, and the focus of unrest has been a scene of celebrations for the last few days after army units united with protesters and made it the center of liberated Libya.
[01:01:18.467 --> 01:01:29.434]  People have danced in the streets, shut up fireworks, and even returned their arms to the military as popular communities have brought new order to the city.
[01:01:29.434 --> 01:01:31.255]  Oh, aren't they good?
[01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:33.416]  They're turning their guns in.
[01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:37.439]  The media's like, oh, a symbol of liberty, handing your firearm in.
[01:01:37.439 --> 01:01:44.123]  Instead of the American Eagle being our symbol, if the globalists could have it, it wouldn't be an ostrich, or it wouldn't be a sloth.
[01:01:44.123 --> 01:01:46.765]  It would be a firearm being broken into.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.861]  That's actually a UN symbol they push.
[01:01:49.861 --> 01:01:51.402]  It's some type of sign of freedom.
[01:01:51.402 --> 01:01:53.023]  That's a sign of slaves.
[01:01:53.023 --> 01:02:01.548]  Benghazi, again, residents have also followed the horror still unfolding in Tripoli, the capital.
[01:02:01.548 --> 01:02:04.770]  They're increasingly receiving messages of desperation from Tripoli.
[01:02:05.677 --> 01:02:10.621]  With the population they're asking for help from Benghazi and other liberated areas.
[01:02:10.621 --> 01:02:14.344]  So they state here that the entire population says they're under terror.
[01:02:14.344 --> 01:02:16.946]  The entire population wants to be liberated.
[01:02:16.946 --> 01:02:27.274]  I've seen previous analysis of things in Libya and it looks like he's 50-50 popular.
[01:02:27.274 --> 01:02:29.175]  Not a super unpopular dictator.
[01:02:29.175 --> 01:02:29.936]  Not saying he's good.
[01:02:31.325 --> 01:02:35.188]  The point is, is that this is a staged event, and now they want to send in U.S.
[01:02:35.188 --> 01:02:37.130]  forces into the country.
[01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:44.575]  But just notice how they just, and all over our news, supposedly professional news, they just state these rumors as if they're fact.
[01:02:44.575 --> 01:02:46.937]  Oh, you know, he's left.
[01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:50.560]  The British Foreign Ministry confirms he's on his way to Venezuela.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.321]  That was four days ago.
[01:02:52.438 --> 01:02:53.919]  Was it true?
[01:02:53.919 --> 01:02:57.041]  So we don't know how much of this is true and how much of it isn't.
[01:02:57.041 --> 01:03:04.025]  Also in nearby Al-Baida, the people have set up a provisional government that is trying to reorganize the city and provide security.
[01:03:04.025 --> 01:03:09.089]  Residents agree on Libyan unity and preparations to join the fight to liberate Tripoli.
[01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:12.451]  So they're calling it Libyan unity.
[01:03:12.451 --> 01:03:17.254]  Like Obama said, we must all be of one mind, and that is we're going to invade.
[01:03:18.874 --> 01:03:25.158]  Or at least start bombarding him to help liberate the people.
[01:03:25.158 --> 01:03:27.700]  So he can fire off a bunch of nerve gas and destabilize.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.202]  Oh, by the way, oil prices, crude breaches 119.
[01:03:31.202 --> 01:03:32.182]  It went up 9% on Tuesday.
[01:03:32.182 --> 01:03:34.044]  It went up over 3% on Wednesday.
[01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:36.085]  And now it has surged today massively.
[01:03:47.108 --> 01:03:48.349]  So, here's the article.
[01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:52.092]  Crude breaches 119 in frantic trading.
[01:03:52.092 --> 01:04:02.121]  Brent crude reached 119 a barrel during a period of frantic trading as industrial needs were hedged and traders exploited momentum.
[01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:10.868]  Worries that reduced supplies from Libya may have replicated in other regional producers facing potential political turmoil.
[01:04:10.868 --> 01:04:15.252]  See, this is going all over the world, because the globalists are triggering it all over the world.
[01:04:16.721 --> 01:04:18.802]  Because of course, everybody hates the government worldwide.
[01:04:18.802 --> 01:04:21.083]  Everybody hates corrupt, stinking governments.
[01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:23.084]  Wickedness in high places.
[01:04:23.084 --> 01:04:26.345]  Our Congress, depending on the poll, has an 11 to a 9% approval rating.
[01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:42.323]  But if a foreign group came in and organized people to start a war against our government, and then people started burning things and taking over, and then a foreign army was going to come in to help us liberate America, why would the foreign army be doing that?
[01:04:42.323 --> 01:04:46.448]  Because they were going to put something in worse, something they want in place.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.041]  Understand what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:04:50.041 --> 01:04:52.002]  We're going to continue going over this.
[01:04:52.002 --> 01:04:54.724]  Charlie Sheen is coming up in the next hour.
[01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.745]  And this interview is going to make headlines.
[01:04:56.745 --> 01:04:57.986]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.986 --> 01:04:58.386]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.083]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:06.004]  Number 1.
[01:05:06.004 --> 01:05:09.426]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.426 --> 01:05:10.287]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.287 --> 01:05:15.170]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:15.910]  It's true.
[01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:20.794]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.794 --> 01:05:21.614]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.614 --> 01:05:25.216]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.216 --> 01:05:28.919]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:29.899]  Number 4.
[01:05:29.899 --> 01:05:32.660]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.342]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.342 --> 01:05:37.122]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.122 --> 01:05:41.284]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.284 --> 01:05:46.326]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.326 --> 01:05:50.507]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.507 --> 01:05:52.288]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:00.673 --> 01:06:04.236]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:04.236 --> 01:06:05.377]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:05.377 --> 01:06:09.941]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:15.886]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:15.886 --> 01:06:18.028]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:18.028 --> 01:06:20.710]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:27.556]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:27.556 --> 01:06:29.759]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:29.759 --> 01:06:35.104]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:35.104 --> 01:06:40.409]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:40.409 --> 01:06:45.534]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:06:45.754 --> 01:06:48.936]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:06:48.936 --> 01:06:54.200]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.264]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:06:59.264 --> 01:07:01.185]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:08.090]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.372]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:10.632 --> 01:07:16.015]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:16.015 --> 01:07:19.056]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:21.377]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:21.377 --> 01:07:27.620]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:31.001]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:31.001 --> 01:07:36.504]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:38.425]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:38.425 --> 01:07:39.706]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:42.387]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:42.387 --> 01:07:46.609]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:51.232]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:51.232 --> 01:07:53.833]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:56.835]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:56.835 --> 01:07:57.455]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:08:01.707 --> 01:08:04.475]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:07.282]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.079 --> 01:08:30.841]  This is a big deal.
[01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:39.271]  I cannot stress to you, the listeners of the syndicated radio broadcast and those watching as we simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv in video, live in color.
[01:08:40.646 --> 01:08:48.408]  That Obama's speech last night saying we, in the past days, have been preparing an international response into Libya.
[01:08:48.408 --> 01:08:54.150]  You notice they used the cover of Egypt to move in a couple more aircraft carriers and big task force groups.
[01:08:54.150 --> 01:09:00.352]  Oil prices have gone up more than, what, $27 this week.
[01:09:00.352 --> 01:09:02.732]  They're up to $119 right now.
[01:09:02.732 --> 01:09:06.434]  We haven't seen oil prices at the gas pump this high since 2008.
[01:09:08.914 --> 01:09:16.717]  And they are preparing globalist-backed units in Benghazi to try to invade Tripoli.
[01:09:16.717 --> 01:09:22.940]  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that they believe he has nerve gas and high-tech missiles.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:48.646]  He's gonna try to use... Now I want to pull back from this and look at the larger geopolitical ramifications because every political analyst who we have had on this show, we only have people on who've been right about 95% of the time, people who really know what's happening in the world and folks that their information matches my research but then they can take us even further because of their specialities in those areas, are concurring and we're saying years ago, months ago,
[01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:50.667]  You heard him here.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.221]  No, they're bad.
[01:10:28.527 --> 01:10:33.293]  And it's a political climate, an atmosphere, where the globalists can knock the dominoes over.
[01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:35.135]  The question is, why do they want that?
[01:10:35.135 --> 01:10:42.343]  Now, I haven't talked or even read in the last few days, I probably should have, but I get so busy, what Wayne Madsen thinks about this.
[01:10:43.157 --> 01:10:46.742]  I know he predicted a lot of this years ago and again months ago on the show.
[01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:50.968]  Formerly an anti-submarine warfare expert.
[01:10:50.968 --> 01:10:54.332]  Worked then in the NSA and a lot of other classified areas.
[01:10:54.332 --> 01:10:57.216]  He's written for some of the biggest magazines and newspapers in the nation.
[01:10:57.216 --> 01:10:59.299]  Wayne Madsen Report dot com.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:11.647]  He reports on national security and international issues for major TV stations around the world and he also reports routinely from what's happening at the National Press Club.
[01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:18.331]  So I don't know what he's going to say about what's happening in Tripoli or what's happening in Egypt or this domino effect.
[01:11:19.251 --> 01:11:19.611]  I don't
[01:11:37.222 --> 01:11:38.423]  We're good to go.
[01:11:53.539 --> 01:11:57.664]  So for the next 30 minutes, we're joined by Wayne Madsen and Wayne Madsen Report.
[01:11:57.664 --> 01:12:08.619]  Wayne, you've heard me in the last three minutes break down my analysis of this and the horror of the prospect of UN, NATO, U.S.-backed forces going into Tripoli.
[01:12:08.619 --> 01:12:10.081]  Give us your take on what you think.
[01:12:11.232 --> 01:12:34.227]  Well, I still believe that what we're seeing in North Africa, especially North Africa, was triggered by the same forces that triggered the anti-government, anti-austerity moves in Greece, where we had riots there again over the austerity measures, the budget cuts in the last few days.
[01:12:34.227 --> 01:12:38.130]  We saw it in Spain, we saw it in the UK, and I think that this
[01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:47.338]  What really was seething under all the other problems we had in North Africa.
[01:12:47.338 --> 01:13:01.412]  Now, we know from the State Department cable, from WikiLeaks, that obviously the NGOs, the Soros-backed groups, the National Endowment for Democracy, the Freedom House, and these other
[01:13:02.313 --> 01:13:04.696]  Oh, they admit they are!
[01:13:04.696 --> 01:13:05.497]  They're bragging now, Wayne!
[01:13:17.074 --> 01:13:30.159]  Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia and the Lotus Revolution in Egypt, that these were going to be soft-landing type changeovers like they saw in Ukraine and a few of these other soft revolutions.
[01:13:30.159 --> 01:13:36.321]  But they miscalculated because of the unemployment and the high food prices.
[01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:41.483]  And it disgusts, especially amongst the young people, about these regimes.
[01:13:42.183 --> 01:13:47.770]  This thing, these exploded, and I believe that they're not under control anymore.
[01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:54.958]  We know, there were signs that Gaddafi last month was thinking about succession.
[01:13:54.958 --> 01:13:58.843]  I was on Saeed al-Islam, Gaddafi, I've written about this.
[01:13:58.843 --> 01:13:59.424]  This guy was
[01:13:59.924 --> 01:14:03.625]  This guy was a sweetheart as far as the elites of Europe were concerned.
[01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:09.866]  He's a good friend of Lord Peter Mandelson, the former British business secretary.
[01:14:09.866 --> 01:14:16.848]  He's very good friends with Prince Andrew, and also very good friends with Nathaniel Rothschild, the scion of the Rothschild family.
[01:14:16.848 --> 01:14:20.749]  This is a crowd he traveled with.
[01:14:20.749 --> 01:14:22.869]  He's a graduate of the London School of Economics.
[01:14:23.522 --> 01:14:34.587]  But now, we heard him defending his father on TV, talking about, you know, you'll be shot if you are caught with weapons and all this type of thing.
[01:14:34.587 --> 01:14:35.588]  This is out of control.
[01:14:35.588 --> 01:14:46.753]  I was in Qaddafi's tent in Tripoli in October 2009, and it was the 40th anniversary of the coup, which he called his Green Revolution, and overthrew the king.
[01:14:46.753 --> 01:14:49.635]  But I find it interesting, last month Qaddafi
[01:14:50.251 --> 01:14:51.191]  I came back.
[01:14:51.191 --> 01:14:54.152]  Royal property seized from the King's family.
[01:14:54.152 --> 01:14:56.293]  King Idris, Al-Sinusi.
[01:14:56.293 --> 01:15:00.074]  Al-Sinusi were from Gaddafi, Cyrenaica.
[01:15:00.074 --> 01:15:01.854]  That's the area that is broken away.
[01:15:01.854 --> 01:15:10.696]  So, I believe that Gaddafi probably understood that the rumblings in Libya, that his days were short.
[01:15:10.696 --> 01:15:17.018]  And he was looking at succession, possibly a role for the former royal family.
[01:15:17.637 --> 01:15:18.297]  We're good to go.
[01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.646]  Okay, Wayne, we got you on short notice.
[01:15:31.646 --> 01:15:32.666]  You're on your cell phone.
[01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:35.547]  I'm going to wait a moment until it comes back and gets a little bit better.
[01:15:35.547 --> 01:15:40.329]  But the big issue I want to bring up to you, what do you make of Obama's incredible speech?
[01:15:40.329 --> 01:15:42.589]  I mean, this is war under another name.
[01:15:42.589 --> 01:15:44.770]  He says, we're preparing an intervention.
[01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:48.571]  We're preparing international forces to go in.
[01:15:48.571 --> 01:15:57.554]  And now they're reporting, The Wall Street Journal and others, that Qaddafi's, I believe it, I know he's got it, heavily armed, is going to try to use nerve gas on him.
[01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:58.835]  And I mean, this is a nightmare.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.062]  Well, the Wall Street Journal, I'm always skeptical about them.
[01:16:03.062 --> 01:16:05.143]  They're neocons, from the word go.
[01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:17.470]  We also have his Justice Minister, who resigned, saying that Qaddafi was totally behind Lockerbie, when we know, to the contrary, it was Iran, of course.
[01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:18.351]  George H.W.
[01:16:18.351 --> 01:16:28.077]  Bush found it convenient to blame Qaddafi because he didn't want Iran getting involved with plans to go into Iraq during the lead-up to Desert Storm.
[01:16:28.937 --> 01:16:39.372]  So there's a lot of people who have left Qaddafi's regime who for one reason or another, sort of like those old Soviet defectors, they always would overstate the threat.
[01:16:39.372 --> 01:16:42.857]  Or it's like all the Iraqi defectors that we now know were paid to lie.
[01:16:43.357 --> 01:16:44.578]  Oh, absolutely, like curveball.
[01:16:44.578 --> 01:16:51.846]  So I would take some of what these guys are saying with a grain of salt about Qaddafi having bio and chemical weapons.
[01:16:51.846 --> 01:17:01.196]  After all, he allowed inspectors in there under the Bush administration, the last administration, to turn all that stuff over.
[01:17:01.196 --> 01:17:05.681]  So these people are obviously trying to score political points more with the Western media.
[01:17:06.141 --> 01:17:15.372]  But it was quite clear when I was in Tripoli that Gaddafi, who gave a speech today where he's talking about he's no different than the Queen of England or the King of Thailand.
[01:17:15.372 --> 01:17:17.494]  He's just a figurehead.
[01:17:17.494 --> 01:17:18.655]  He has no real power.
[01:17:18.655 --> 01:17:20.738]  Well, when you first land in Tripoli, you see his
[01:17:21.378 --> 01:17:23.340]  His portrait is everywhere.
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:28.183]  Huge portraits on the sides of buildings.
[01:17:28.183 --> 01:17:31.385]  Overpasses on the highways going into Tripoli.
[01:17:31.385 --> 01:17:36.088]  In hotels, in lobbies, in offices everywhere.
[01:17:36.088 --> 01:17:38.910]  You find Gaddafi looking down at you.
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:45.575]  Kind of like Janet Napolitano on the high-tech telescreens going in 9,000 locations.
[01:17:45.575 --> 01:17:49.197]  Another telltale sign of classical corruption in 1984 societies.
[01:17:50.808 --> 01:17:58.250]  Right, and it's clear that this was a dictatorship, a cult of personality like in North Korea with Kim Jong-il.
[01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:04.171]  And the other thing I noticed is people even close to Qaddafi would talk about him.
[01:18:04.171 --> 01:18:07.792]  It was clear that even the people in his regime did not like him.
[01:18:07.792 --> 01:18:12.993]  As a matter of fact, when I was in his tent, I said, what's with that guy?
[01:18:12.993 --> 01:18:18.374]  I know he doesn't drink, but it's clear he's on medication, thinking maybe the guy's ill.
[01:18:18.954 --> 01:18:22.178]  You can look at him, Wayne, and tell that he's on some hardcore drugs.
[01:18:37.887 --> 01:18:39.628]  Yeah, it has been for quite a long time.
[01:18:39.628 --> 01:18:48.670]  Now back when we had an Air Force base outside of Tripoli, now he threw that base out in 69 when he took over, but when he was Sgt.
[01:18:48.670 --> 01:19:00.114]  Qaddafi, he used to make regular runs up to the Class 6 store at the base, that's the booze place, and he would load up his gin and scotch and haul it back to Tripoli.
[01:19:00.114 --> 01:19:03.935]  Now, he said it was for the senior officers in the King's Army, but
[01:19:04.355 --> 01:19:11.422]  I also heard from people who were at Wheelers that he grabbed a few of those bottles for himself.
[01:19:11.422 --> 01:19:23.355]  Qaddafi is an enigma wrapped in an enigma, but there's even some questions about his mother being full-blooded Italian, so he may not be a pure-blooded Arab.
[01:19:25.202 --> 01:19:34.889]  Wow, well, we're going to come back and get into other facets of this, but studying the region and the other larger geopolitical ramifications, who are the different factions?
[01:19:34.889 --> 01:19:36.970]  What countries do you see that are going to fall next?
[01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:41.113]  What do you think about Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, even Jordan?
[01:19:41.914 --> 01:19:58.113]  We've got now riots flaring up in and around Israel in the West Bank and other areas some rockets being fired Reportedly, I mean it's like somebody lit the fuse and the bombs are starting to go off in a chain reaction Wayne Madsen's our guest I'm Alex Jones with info wars.com

[01:22:00.547 --> 01:22:08.694]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:22:08.694 --> 01:22:11.256]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:22:11.256 --> 01:22:16.661]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:22:16.661 --> 01:22:19.623]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:22:19.623 --> 01:22:21.425]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:22:21.925 --> 01:22:28.206]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:22:28.206 --> 01:22:31.607]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:22:31.607 --> 01:22:37.408]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:22:37.408 --> 01:22:39.069]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:22:39.069 --> 01:22:40.369]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:22:40.369 --> 01:22:43.049]  You should at least watch this free video online today.

[01:23:00.345 --> 01:23:04.449]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?

[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.543]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[01:23:23.609 --> 01:23:27.010]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:28.891]  There is no other program of its kind.

[01:24:07.098 --> 01:24:14.395]  Alright Wayne, finishing up with this.
[01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:20.273]  Specifically, what do you make of Obama talking about an international force invading?
[01:24:20.273 --> 01:24:27.717]  Do you think that's on the table, with all those ships and task forces there in the Mediterranean right off the coast, loitering about?
[01:24:27.717 --> 01:24:33.500]  And then expanding on that, how do you see this going, just from your research?
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:38.323]  What are your different scenarios, and what's the larger geopolitical ramifications?
[01:24:39.218 --> 01:24:47.607]  Well, I think Obama, what he was doing, he's so late to the game on all these crises in these countries.
[01:24:47.607 --> 01:24:48.849]  He had to say something.
[01:24:48.849 --> 01:24:51.511]  He hadn't said anything about Libya.
[01:24:51.511 --> 01:24:56.677]  As far as military action, the State Department couldn't even organize a ferry for U.S.
[01:24:56.677 --> 01:25:00.201]  citizens trapped there, a ferry to Malta, then it got trapped.
[01:25:00.601 --> 01:25:01.362]  We're good to go.
[01:25:17.725 --> 01:25:18.486]  I don't think so.
[01:25:36.107 --> 01:25:38.691]  So any day now he could run to South Africa?
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:26:01.663]  Oh, he could go to South Africa, I don't know whether they'd want him there, but certainly Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Gambia, all run by dictators who Gaddafi has supported over the years and who like him.
[01:26:01.663 --> 01:26:05.664]  So he would be welcomed by those dictators, not by the people, certainly.
[01:26:05.664 --> 01:26:17.687]  I think as far as what's going to happen, I think he'll be replaced by, we know a number of his generals have defected, I think they'll wind up on some sort of temporary government
[01:26:18.527 --> 01:26:18.847]  I think?
[01:26:38.586 --> 01:26:46.052]  I'm hearing from people in the Saudi opposition, they don't care about the king coming back and throwing money.
[01:26:46.052 --> 01:26:47.893]  They want him gone.
[01:26:47.893 --> 01:26:53.258]  They wish he had stayed in Morocco where he supposedly was undergoing some sort of medical treatment.
[01:26:53.258 --> 01:26:55.940]  They don't want him back in Saudi Arabia.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.041]  And the other thing is,
[01:26:58.081 --> 01:27:04.644]  Look, after the royal family, there goes, don't even use the term, the country's name will change.
[01:27:04.644 --> 01:27:07.705]  The Saudis are the ruling family.
[01:27:07.705 --> 01:27:12.267]  The opposition certainly would not keep that name in the country's name.
[01:27:12.267 --> 01:27:16.168]  And I think we're talking more in terms of a Democratic Republic of Arabia.
[01:27:16.168 --> 01:27:17.489]  And the country's only 100 years old.
[01:27:19.042 --> 01:27:22.785]  Absolutely, and it was originally two different countries.
[01:27:22.785 --> 01:27:27.889]  We have two million Shias in the eastern province, where the oil is, for the most part.
[01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:29.030]  The refineries are there.
[01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:35.295]  They're seeing what's happening to the Shias in Bahrain, who are a clear majority over there, and they don't like it.
[01:27:35.295 --> 01:27:42.901]  And they know that the Bahrain king and the Saudi king are, you know, mano-a-mano here on a lot of these issues.
[01:27:42.901 --> 01:27:45.263]  As a matter of fact, King Hamad of Bahrain welcomed
[01:27:45.663 --> 01:27:48.965]  King Abdullah back from Morocco in Saudi Arabia.
[01:27:48.965 --> 01:27:58.951]  I also think that in Yemen we're going to see probably the Saleh regime fall there, and we'll see the restoration of the independence for South Yemen.
[01:27:58.951 --> 01:28:00.012]  It used to be independent.
[01:28:00.012 --> 01:28:09.017]  It was cobbled together with North Yemen, basically by the United States and other Western countries, and South Yemenis always felt messed over by that.
[01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:14.200]  So I think we're going to see the independence of South Yemen restored, and as far as other
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:20.683]  On the periphery, I think the King of Morocco is under a lot of pressure to give up some of his powers.
[01:28:20.683 --> 01:28:22.924]  We're going to see some movement there.
[01:28:22.924 --> 01:28:31.327]  The King Abdullah of Jordan, of course, him and he and his father, Hussein, accepted billions of dollars from the CIA.
[01:28:31.327 --> 01:28:34.129]  They're basically US puppets.
[01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:37.070]  I think he's going to be under a lot of pressure as well.
[01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:41.392]  And on the periphery, look for the regime in Djibouti, where the US has an NSA base
[01:28:41.952 --> 01:28:42.873]  A military base.
[01:28:42.873 --> 01:28:47.138]  Look for that regime that's been there ever since independence in 1978.
[01:28:47.138 --> 01:28:48.059]  Look for that to go.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:29:08.449]  Well, it's encouraging that you don't think that this is as big a threat as some do with some of the high-tech and very deadly weapons that Qaddafi has, and that it sounds like you're saying you're leaning towards him fleeing instead of battling it out with nerve gas, though he said he's going to die on Libyan soil.
[01:29:08.449 --> 01:29:10.610]  I mean, I think it's a wild card.
[01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:11.631]  But we're going to go to break.
[01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:16.153]  I want to come back and ask why you think this isn't going as well as the globalists thought it would.
[01:29:16.733 --> 01:29:17.113]  I think so.
[01:29:43.632 --> 01:29:46.374]  And why do you think the globalists triggered this to begin with?
[01:29:46.374 --> 01:29:47.894]  I mean, what are they looking for?
[01:29:47.894 --> 01:29:48.535]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.535 --> 01:29:48.955]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.955 --> 01:29:50.976]  Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[01:29:50.976 --> 01:29:52.356]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.356 --> 01:29:54.877]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.877 --> 01:29:57.579]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.574 --> 01:30:06.537]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:06.537 --> 01:30:15.404]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:30:15.404 --> 01:30:20.028]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:30:20.028 --> 01:30:30.857]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:30:31.477 --> 01:30:40.980]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:46.422]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:30:46.422 --> 01:30:53.905]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:53.905 --> 01:30:56.306]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:31:01.761 --> 01:31:05.782]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.782 --> 01:31:09.023]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.023 --> 01:31:13.824]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.824 --> 01:31:20.206]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.206 --> 01:31:22.447]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.967 --> 01:31:23.287]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.287 --> 01:31:23.807]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.807 --> 01:31:24.488]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.488 --> 01:31:25.769]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.769 --> 01:31:28.010]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.897 --> 01:31:49.160]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:58.283]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.793]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.793 --> 01:32:05.714]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.714 --> 01:32:09.136]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.136 --> 01:32:09.997]  Number 2.
[01:32:09.997 --> 01:32:14.900]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:15.640]  It's true.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.504]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.504 --> 01:32:21.344]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.344 --> 01:32:24.926]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.926 --> 01:32:28.629]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.829 --> 01:32:29.629]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:32.370]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:36.052]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.052 --> 01:32:36.852]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.852 --> 01:32:40.994]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.994 --> 01:32:46.036]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.036 --> 01:32:50.217]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.217 --> 01:32:52.018]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.018 --> 01:32:56.620]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:33:05.029 --> 01:33:09.815]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:09.815 --> 01:33:14.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.624]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[01:33:44.525 --> 01:33:51.849]  We do have Charlie Sheen, the big exclusive interview, clearing the air, telling the facts, joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:51.849 --> 01:33:56.532]  You can imagine there's a lot of big international, national media tuning in right now.
[01:33:56.532 --> 01:34:00.354]  So for those listening, it's coming up here in about 30 minutes now.
[01:34:02.538 --> 01:34:02.758]  I don't
[01:34:23.801 --> 01:34:47.875]  Heating oil power and food and so whereas food prices going up here hurts Americans But doesn't put most Americans on the streets and there's some something of a social welfare net here with 43 million plus Americans on Food stamps and the globalists have created that crisis and are now trying to trigger this domino effect But but but what was their goal and why do you think they're failing because you mentioned that earlier?
[01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:49.376]  But I want to spend some more time on that
[01:34:50.131 --> 01:35:15.157]  Well, I think the North African countries, like the European countries, especially those on the Mediterranean coast, are being hit by the same sort of austerity measures, World Bank, IMF imposed measures, which has driven up the cost of food, of petrol, of gasoline, lots of unemployment amongst the young people.
[01:35:15.157 --> 01:35:16.077]  These are people with
[01:35:16.597 --> 01:35:22.321]  With, you know, advanced degrees, college degrees, masters and even PhDs.
[01:35:22.321 --> 01:35:26.024]  And that just triggers this type of revolt.
[01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:31.748]  And Libya was certainly no exception to this, as we saw with Tunisia and Egypt.
[01:35:32.448 --> 01:35:40.132]  I would note that Qaddafi today was blaming Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda for the revolt in Libya against him.
[01:35:40.132 --> 01:35:51.298]  My God, he sounds like George W. Bush or, you know, when they got to pull the Al-Qaeda rabbit out of the hat, he sounds like Obama or Napolitano and these people.
[01:35:51.758 --> 01:36:04.842]  But he's in full agreement with propaganda coming from Israeli-linked websites saying that Al-Qaeda and the Maghreb is all behind the rebellion against Gaddafi.
[01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:10.084]  So, you know, this non-existent bin Laden, he's citing him as a threat.
[01:36:10.084 --> 01:36:11.384]  I think he's desperate.
[01:36:11.384 --> 01:36:16.806]  He's using the same boogeyman at W as used in others in this country.
[01:36:16.806 --> 01:36:20.807]  And I think we will not be seeing Mr. Gaddafi around.
[01:36:21.867 --> 01:36:27.976]  I would give him a matter of days, maybe a week, but no more than that.
[01:36:27.976 --> 01:36:34.666]  And you're predicting he'll run to Zimbabwe just north of South Africa?
[01:36:35.342 --> 01:36:46.226]  Yeah, he'll either go there or one of these other dictatorships where he's very, you know, he's pumped millions, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars into propping up the regime.
[01:36:46.226 --> 01:36:55.508]  So if he's not shot or he doesn't shoot himself, I think that, and I doubt he's good, but some people think he might commit suicide.
[01:36:55.508 --> 01:36:57.669]  The guy's incredibly veiny.
[01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:59.970]  The Tutsi War where the best Italian made
[01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:08.432]  Why they put the British Foreign Ministry as you noticed on Monday put out the fact that he'd run to Venezuela and said that they'd confirmed it.
[01:37:08.432 --> 01:37:10.833]  Was that just to further destabilize him in the country?
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.805]  I possibly, you know, because Chavez basically said, look, we don't want him over here.
[01:37:26.805 --> 01:37:28.686]  I've got enough issues with the United States.
[01:37:28.686 --> 01:37:32.790]  I don't want to be accused of harboring Gaddafi on top of everything else.
[01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:44.379]  So, yeah, William Hague, of course, the British Foreign Secretary, is a real, you talk about anyone who's tied in with the CFR and that crowd, look no further than a guy like William Hague.
[01:37:44.379 --> 01:37:47.322]  I mean, he's really polished, but he's a consummate liar.
[01:37:48.786 --> 01:37:50.571]  Wayne Madsen, briefly, and then we're going to let you go.
[01:37:50.571 --> 01:37:53.319]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:37:53.319 --> 01:37:55.485]  Again, what do you see as the next big hotspots?
[01:37:55.485 --> 01:37:56.849]  Do you expect other countries to fall?
[01:37:58.355 --> 01:38:05.899]  I would watch Algeria, although that regime is being propped up by Sarkozy in France.
[01:38:05.899 --> 01:38:07.099]  I would look at Morocco.
[01:38:07.099 --> 01:38:12.502]  I don't think we're going to see hard falls there like we saw in Tunisia, Egypt, and soon in Libya.
[01:38:12.502 --> 01:38:21.206]  Yemen definitely, I think, is going to be a hard fall with the re-emergence of independent South Yemen, North Yemen being independent as well.
[01:38:21.206 --> 01:38:26.649]  And Saudi Arabia, the opposition there is getting very well organized.
[01:38:29.755 --> 01:38:33.697]  Well, we just lost Wayne, his phone cut, but it was time for him to go.
[01:38:33.697 --> 01:38:35.897]  Thank you, Wayne Madsen, for joining us.
[01:38:35.897 --> 01:38:43.720]  Now, I'm gonna premiere a special audio-video presentation that we put together in the last week.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.922]  And we did this because a major magazine called and said they'd noticed these things.
[01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:51.883]  We actually went and did research and found out that, yes, indeed, it's true.
[01:38:51.883 --> 01:38:58.206]  Glenn Beck is basically copying everything on this show, word for word, but then changing it and adding things to it.
[01:38:59.246 --> 01:39:07.309]  Uh, and, uh, it's important, as Glenn Beck is a phenomenon, I think he does quite a bit of good, but also some bad, to look at Glenn Beck.
[01:39:07.309 --> 01:39:17.052]  And so, up until the next break and the break after that, uh, we are going to be, uh, premiering here, uh, Glenn Beck's secret.
[01:39:18.388 --> 01:39:27.038]  And that's the article up on InfoWars.com, up on PrisonPlanet.com if you're a radio listener and want to see the videos, see the exhibits, see the dates.
[01:39:27.038 --> 01:39:34.207]  We play where I say something years before or months before and then he almost word for word says it on the same issue.
[01:39:35.288 --> 01:39:37.009]  Years or months later.
[01:39:37.009 --> 01:39:42.672]  And I also have sources inside Beck's operation, inside Fox, and I already know he's doing this.
[01:39:42.672 --> 01:39:45.693]  And he also tells people, people will say, well, why are you bashing on Beck?
[01:39:45.693 --> 01:39:51.696]  Well, he tells people that are guests on his show, once he gets them for my show, not to come on my show.
[01:39:51.696 --> 01:39:53.037]  I've been told that by a lot of people.
[01:39:53.037 --> 01:39:57.179]  He, he, he, he, Glenn Beck knows that he's basically ripped me off.
[01:39:57.179 --> 01:39:59.120]  So he wants to suppress me and I'm tired of it.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:39:59.700]  Here's the video.
[01:40:05.273 --> 01:40:06.436]  I'm a busy person.
[01:40:06.436 --> 01:40:08.340]  I have my own syndicated radio show.
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:10.344]  I produce documentary films.
[01:40:10.344 --> 01:40:11.927]  I do countless interviews.
[01:40:11.927 --> 01:40:14.813]  I don't have time to watch Glenn Beck.
[01:40:16.363 --> 01:40:30.133]  But because the national media has pointed out that Glenn Beck is ripping off the information I cover, and then basically spinning it, I have been forced in the last year to monitor his radio show and to watch his television show off and on.
[01:40:30.133 --> 01:40:40.241]  Every time I watch him, I see incredible truths being brought out on national television and on syndicated radio, but with lies being injected into it.
[01:40:40.241 --> 01:40:45.745]  Media Matters, Newsweek, you name it, have all pointed out that Glenn Beck more and more echoes
[01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:46.465]  Yes.
[01:41:03.826 --> 01:41:10.391]  A facsimile of what I am and puts him forward so that he will compromise the information.
[01:41:10.391 --> 01:41:22.219]  So Glenn Beck goes from being this mainline Republican just three or four years ago who was admittedly getting marching orders at the White House from George W. Bush to the guy that's going to deliver us from world government.
[01:41:22.219 --> 01:41:28.583]  But if he was just taking my material and my research and my information and putting it out, I would be honored.
[01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:30.825]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.
[01:41:31.505 --> 01:41:33.207]  But that's not what he's doing.
[01:41:33.207 --> 01:41:55.246]  This is Glenn Beck taking all the hardcore research I do where I work 18 hours a day and even dream about this information when I'm asleep and I put it together with my team that bust their butt and then I watch him take it and twist it and manipulate it so they can control the left and the right in this synthesis setting up this world government.
[01:41:56.434 --> 01:42:13.045]  Now, recently I was called by one of the biggest magazines in the country, who's doing a big piece on Glenn Beck, basically ripping off and spinning and twisting the information we cover in our research, and they said, well, we've all seen examples of him doing this, but can you send us five examples?
[01:42:13.045 --> 01:42:23.432]  Aaron and I put together a six-page document in just the last two days that is only the tip of the iceberg, and I'm only gonna have time to cover a few of these.
[01:42:24.457 --> 01:42:34.383]  But, you can see it for yourself, that he doesn't just steal the information, he then degradates it, he then poisons it, he then spins it.
[01:42:35.305 --> 01:42:41.810]  To where sometimes I get radio calls from new listeners or I see people on the street and they say, you're like Glenn Beck.
[01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:47.174]  Glenn Beck has been fighting the New World Order, quote, for just about two years.
[01:42:47.174 --> 01:43:00.964]  I've been fighting the New World Order for 16 years from a truly grassroots, full-spectrum analysis point of view, not from a left-right system that is a control grid that the globalists use to divide the people.
[01:43:00.964 --> 01:43:01.765]  And it's painful.
[01:43:02.847 --> 01:43:06.108]  To see my work being used and taken and twisted.
[01:43:06.108 --> 01:43:07.109]  Here's what's happening.
[01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:19.134]  If you read a Financial Times of London article with the headline, and now for world government, where they admit it's unelected, it's authoritarian, but they say that it's good for you, Media Matters calls you a kook and a nut.
[01:43:19.134 --> 01:43:24.897]  And then Glenn Beck, he plays the part of the patriot who will admit that's going on, but then basically water it down.
[01:43:25.217 --> 01:43:30.140]  Well now there's call for America to give up our dollar for a global currency.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.401]  That would lead to a global government.
[01:43:32.401 --> 01:43:39.525]  And one world currency and one world financial system is the end game.
[01:43:39.525 --> 01:43:47.170]  Year after year I had to sit there and watch Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Fox News make fun of people that talked about a one world government.
[01:43:47.230 --> 01:43:54.953]  The mainline right-wingers sat there as gatekeepers and told their sheeple viewers, don't listen to it, they're kooks, they're nuts.
[01:43:54.953 --> 01:43:59.535]  Now they've basically admitted all this is happening because we're so far down the line.
[01:43:59.535 --> 01:44:03.897]  Those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over, global government.
[01:44:03.897 --> 01:44:05.198]  Conspiracy theorists.
[01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:07.599]  They've been crazy, but now they're right.
[01:44:07.599 --> 01:44:15.162]  So here comes Glenn Beck telling you that world government's run by Van Jones and George Soros when they're mid-level players at best.
[01:44:16.042 --> 01:44:17.244]  It's disgusting.
[01:44:17.244 --> 01:44:19.547]  This is our future we're talking about.
[01:44:19.547 --> 01:44:31.924]  And the very Fox News that told conservatives what was kosher to look into and what was not kosher to look into is now putting forward this prancing creature to be our leader.
[01:44:32.705 --> 01:44:37.726]  So they can destroy him later to discredit our movement against world government.
[01:44:37.726 --> 01:44:53.991]  Google is allowed to do it because they were set up by MIT and the Central Intelligence Agency and they office out in their development firm out of the NASA complex and we've had Mr. Steele and other CIA high-level agents on and technology to document who the people are at the CIA.
[01:44:53.991 --> 01:44:56.652]  Glenn Beck has ripped us off on the Google boycott.
[01:44:57.512 --> 01:44:59.274]  And then spun it deceptively.
[01:44:59.274 --> 01:45:03.718]  First of all, they are working really, really closely with the government.
[01:45:03.718 --> 01:45:04.578]  That's okay.
[01:45:04.578 --> 01:45:07.321]  They have a close relationship with the NSA.
[01:45:07.321 --> 01:45:07.721]  Okay.
[01:45:07.721 --> 01:45:12.846]  They're working way too close, for my comfort, with hardcore leftists.
[01:45:13.566 --> 01:45:18.410]  I'm really not sure that I want my search engine involved in government overthrows.
[01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:19.331]  Good or bad.
[01:45:19.331 --> 01:45:27.797]  He adds the proviso, one of many deceptive lies, that I'm not like the liberals who think that Bush was spying on them without warrants.
[01:45:27.797 --> 01:45:30.419]  I'm just mad at them because they're liberals.
[01:45:30.419 --> 01:45:36.504]  I'm not afraid that Google is reading my email or tapping your phone lines or stealing grandma's recipes.
[01:45:36.504 --> 01:45:41.928]  That kind of paranoia is reserved for the left during the Bush administration with Microsoft.
[01:45:42.328 --> 01:45:45.751]  He's telling conservatives you shouldn't be for the Fourth Amendment.
[01:45:45.751 --> 01:45:48.354]  That conservatives don't have that territory.
[01:45:48.354 --> 01:46:00.405]  He's ripped us off six months after we detailed that top Obama and former Clinton advisers were openly calling for a new Oklahoma City bombing to be blamed on domestic groups and to spike Obama's ratings.
[01:46:00.405 --> 01:46:03.387]  They are setting up another Oklahoma City.
[01:46:03.387 --> 01:46:08.432]  They are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked the one who caused it.
[01:46:08.872 --> 01:46:21.263]  He ripped us off months after we aired the exact same tapes that he later re-aired of the socialist eugenicist George Bernard Shaw talking about killing people who aren't useful to the new world order.
[01:46:26.972 --> 01:46:27.353]  He's amiable.
[01:46:27.353 --> 01:46:27.593]  He's good.
[01:46:27.593 --> 01:46:29.054]  His kindly nature.
[01:46:49.813 --> 01:47:00.388]  In my documentary film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, 2007, we detail David Rockefeller's own memoir, where he bragged that, yeah, I want world government.
[01:47:05.607 --> 01:47:12.950]  Glenn Beck later, in November of 2010, covered the exact same quotes.
[01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:15.351]  There are hundreds of these examples.
[01:47:15.351 --> 01:47:25.016]  Some people even believe that we are part of a secret cabal, working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists.
[01:47:25.496 --> 01:47:30.378]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty and I am proud of it.
[01:47:30.378 --> 01:47:33.719]  An article written by David Rockefeller for the New York Times.
[01:47:33.719 --> 01:47:40.522]  Rockefeller openly lauds and endorses Mao Zedong's actions while celebrating their command and control system.
[01:47:40.522 --> 01:47:45.404]  Communist China is the model planned society for the New World Order.
[01:47:45.404 --> 01:47:50.987]  This is what it's going to look like 2025 global landscape.
[01:47:50.987 --> 01:47:52.727]  This is a government report.
[01:47:52.727 --> 01:47:54.008]  The model of China
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:59.324]  Is the goal that these guys are saying everybody's pretty cool with.
[01:47:59.324 --> 01:48:00.786]  This is what's gonna come.
[01:48:00.786 --> 01:48:12.437]  Months after I interview people like Damon Vickers or Gerald Cilente, Glenn Beck has them on the show and asks them the exact same questions that we've posed on my broadcast.
[01:48:13.118 --> 01:48:21.746]  In the last eight months, we've launched more than 70 successful Google bombs, where I tell my listeners to search key terms.
[01:48:21.746 --> 01:48:28.833]  Now, suddenly in the last month, Glenn Beck has begun the Google bombs, telling his listeners to search a certain term.
[01:48:29.093 --> 01:48:32.534]  Pause the show and look up the word caliphate.
[01:48:32.534 --> 01:48:33.554]  Here's the chart.
[01:48:33.554 --> 01:48:34.755]  Caliphate.
[01:48:34.755 --> 01:48:35.915]  Oh, by the way, we're on at 2 p.m.
[01:48:35.915 --> 01:48:45.799]  And then bragging on their site, we've got over 60 at number one, including three to four to five top terms in a row.
[01:48:45.799 --> 01:48:46.679]  Here's another example.
[01:48:47.279 --> 01:49:02.897]  In the last four years, since 2007, I have covered every week the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense drills and public reports they put out preparing for martial law during societal collapse due to economic crisis.
[01:49:02.897 --> 01:49:06.762]  Suddenly, Glenn Beck covers it almost word for word.
[01:49:07.362 --> 01:49:12.286]  If we have shortages of food, if we have rolling blackouts, there could be civil unrest.
[01:49:12.286 --> 01:49:17.709]  There could be looting, rioting, and that might be the impetus for the government to declare martial law.
[01:49:17.709 --> 01:49:20.851]  You know, I don't think you're a couple years away from something like that.
[01:49:20.851 --> 01:49:25.535]  Of all these issues, there's one that really stands out, and that's the obscure issue.
[01:49:26.295 --> 01:49:26.515]  I think?
[01:49:41.152 --> 01:49:48.078]  After we pushed this out into the mainstream, Glenn Beck was the only major figure to pick up on it, to his credit.
[01:49:48.078 --> 01:49:58.627]  But still, the mainstream media then makes jokes about him, and George Soros-run Media Matters says that he's making it up, even though the federal and state governments are losing lawsuits over it.
[01:49:58.627 --> 01:50:04.291]  And then there's other examples, things that actually make me question if Glenn Beck is a good guy or a bad guy.
[01:50:04.291 --> 01:50:07.094]  Maybe he could be a good guy, trying to work through the system.
[01:50:07.754 --> 01:50:09.496]  Because I've challenged him.
[01:50:09.496 --> 01:50:14.300]  Cover John P. Holdren, the White House science czar, calling for sterilence in the water.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:20.485]  Which one of us actually says, I want to breathe in dirty air and drink in, you know, dirty water?
[01:50:20.485 --> 01:50:22.947]  You know, the kind with sterilence in it.
[01:50:22.947 --> 01:50:24.488]  Cover the eugenicist.
[01:50:24.488 --> 01:50:26.870]  Cover the move for a world government.
[01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:34.517]  The only way to really stop their imagined disaster, to save the planet, is to limit the number of human beings on this planet.
[01:50:34.517 --> 01:50:34.797]  Alright.
[01:50:36.135 --> 01:50:43.444]  Again, I get mad at Beck because he does things like tell people that I have his guests not to come on my show and other things and rip our material off and twist it.
[01:50:43.444 --> 01:50:47.549]  We're going to come back and finish up with the rest of Glenn Beck's secret.
[01:50:47.549 --> 01:50:51.053]  Then coming up eight after next hour, Charlie Sheen live.
[01:50:51.053 --> 01:50:52.375]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:52.375 --> 01:50:54.117]  The transmission will continue.
[01:51:01.035 --> 01:51:02.336]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.336 --> 01:51:07.941]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.941 --> 01:51:12.945]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.945 --> 01:51:18.510]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:20.352]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.612 --> 01:51:21.113]  We're good to go.

[01:51:45.197 --> 01:51:48.640]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.382]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.956 --> 01:52:03.939]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.

[01:53:00.626 --> 01:53:04.047]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:53:04.047 --> 01:53:11.890]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:53:11.890 --> 01:53:16.451]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:53:16.451 --> 01:53:17.891]  It is glutathione.
[01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:21.953]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:53:21.953 --> 01:53:25.314]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:53:25.954 --> 01:53:31.739]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:53:31.739 --> 01:53:38.985]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:38.985 --> 01:53:43.809]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:47.814]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:53:47.814 --> 01:53:48.234]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.234 --> 01:53:48.435]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.435 --> 01:53:49.716]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:53:49.716 --> 01:53:51.018]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:54:01.817 --> 01:54:10.263]  The only way to really stop their imagined disaster, to save the planet, is to limit the number of human beings on this planet.
[01:54:10.263 --> 01:54:13.685]  One child per family, that's negative population growth.
[01:54:13.685 --> 01:54:17.067]  I'm against it and I think I'm not alone.
[01:54:17.067 --> 01:54:20.870]  And then weeks later, he covers it word for word.
[01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:24.753]  But then he always doubles back with spin and deception.
[01:54:24.753 --> 01:54:28.415]  Glenbeck is like orange juice.
[01:54:28.415 --> 01:54:30.116]  It's nutritious.
[01:54:30.116 --> 01:54:30.797]  It's delicious.
[01:54:32.369 --> 01:54:36.450]  But I didn't tell you the rest of what Glenn Beck is.
[01:54:36.450 --> 01:54:43.832]  He's a teaspoon of cyanide, enough to kill 10 elephants in every pitcher.
[01:54:43.832 --> 01:54:44.312]  And that's it.
[01:54:44.312 --> 01:54:45.432]  That's what's so bad about him.
[01:54:45.432 --> 01:54:46.552]  You see the orange juice?
[01:54:46.552 --> 01:54:47.712]  It's sitting on the counter.
[01:54:47.712 --> 01:54:49.153]  You pour it in your glass.
[01:54:49.153 --> 01:54:50.933]  Hey, Google's NSA.
[01:54:50.933 --> 01:54:54.014]  Hey, Google's overthrowing countries to put radical Muslims in.
[01:54:55.543 --> 01:55:00.056]  He doesn't tell you so the military industrial complex has somebody to basically bomb.
[01:55:00.056 --> 01:55:01.661]  He gets your confidence with the truth.
[01:55:02.551 --> 01:55:05.953]  With that glass of orange juice, and he puts a teaspoon of poison in it.
[01:55:05.953 --> 01:55:07.154]  It's unbelievable.
[01:55:07.154 --> 01:55:08.976]  The guy's a complete snake.
[01:55:08.976 --> 01:55:20.884]  When you watch it, it's such 21st century, high-tech propaganda, clearly with psych warfare chiefs, with psy-op degrees, black ops, loading those teleprompters.
[01:55:20.884 --> 01:55:22.265]  It is so evil.
[01:55:22.265 --> 01:55:30.271]  I don't like my identity being stolen, and that I don't like somebody in my name, in my mission, twisting what I've done.
[01:55:31.463 --> 01:55:36.407]  I end up having mainstream media attack me constantly saying I'm the little Glenn Beck.
[01:55:36.407 --> 01:55:39.270]  No, I'm not the little Glenn Beck.
[01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:41.852]  I'm up towards the fount.
[01:55:41.852 --> 01:55:50.180]  I'm up the river where the water came from, not downstream where Glenn Beck is basically urinating into the truth.
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:51.060]  Let's get that straight.
[01:55:52.045 --> 01:56:13.279]  Do you know what it's like to pour your heart and soul out, to be death-threatened, to be physically attacked, to not go along with the payoff, sell-out offers, and then to feel good and to have integrity, and then to see somebody come along and basically, as an actor, rip off the information you're covering, and then adulterate it?
[01:56:13.279 --> 01:56:16.021]  We're in a fight for the heart and soul of this country.
[01:56:16.021 --> 01:56:21.445]  The Tea Party, started by the Ron Paul movement in 2007, has been partially co-op by the neocons.
[01:56:22.385 --> 01:56:26.267]  The Tea Party Coalition in Congress went ahead and voted for the Patriot Act.
[01:56:26.267 --> 01:56:32.791]  We were sent by law enforcement two years ago, the internal government documents, MIAC, Homeland Security, where it has nothing to do with men in caves.
[01:56:32.791 --> 01:56:36.393]  It's all about the American people, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives.
[01:56:37.529 --> 01:56:41.130]  If the people don't get wise to Glenn Beck, we don't have any future.
[01:56:41.130 --> 01:56:43.912]  I mean, it's really just that simple.
[01:56:43.912 --> 01:56:52.035]  But the fact that he has to mimic us and take on our political colorations as camouflage does show how far we've come.
[01:56:52.035 --> 01:56:57.797]  We have a global government run by private banking cartels that's taken over our nation.
[01:56:57.797 --> 01:57:04.980]  And Glenn, we cannot allow you to blame it all on a mid-level nobody like Van Jones and tell us he's the top of the pyramid.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:17.402]  Glenn, I'll really start to believe in you when you do a show on Rupert Murdoch, admittedly being one of the key people behind the move for global carbon taxes to fund this new private world government.
[01:57:17.402 --> 01:57:19.083]  And I want to tell The Globalist something.
[01:57:19.083 --> 01:57:22.183]  You think Glenn Beck's co-opted my message and my information?
[01:57:22.183 --> 01:57:23.123]  No.
[01:57:23.123 --> 01:57:24.584]  This door swings both ways.
[01:57:24.584 --> 01:57:27.844]  This is a two-way street, a double-edged sword.
[01:57:27.844 --> 01:57:31.025]  We're only getting more viewers and more listeners because of Glenn Beck.
[01:57:31.926 --> 01:57:39.351]  People are using him as a doorway, and then they're finding the real bonafide information.
[01:57:39.351 --> 01:57:45.175]  So in the end, it's like God says in the Bible, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:57:45.175 --> 01:57:47.576]  You give us lemons, we're gonna make lemonade.
[01:57:47.576 --> 01:57:52.239]  It's just that I get more angry at Beck than like an evil Mr. Maddow.
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:53.680]  I think?
[01:58:12.188 --> 01:58:16.750]  Back when Bush was in office, they'd talk about Patriot Act, and torture, and evil, and corruption.
[01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:18.451]  And now they don't really do it.
[01:58:18.451 --> 01:58:22.572]  Because they were playing the part of anti-establishment when Bush was in.
[01:58:22.572 --> 01:58:29.315]  Now that they see their wing as being in power, of the same bird of prey, they're playing the part of the establishment.
[01:58:29.315 --> 01:58:38.199]  But I know you guys think you can spin it later, and you only care about this cycle, and the next election coming up, and they'll have a new flim-flam man by then.
[01:58:38.199 --> 01:58:40.780]  But cycles are getting...
[01:58:42.412 --> 01:58:46.053]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.053 --> 01:58:50.994]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.994 --> 01:58:52.114]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:52.114 --> 01:58:58.855]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.855 --> 01:59:01.656]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.656 --> 01:59:06.817]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:07.017 --> 01:59:10.058]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:10.058 --> 01:59:12.379]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.379 --> 01:59:18.641]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.641 --> 01:59:22.002]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:22.002 --> 01:59:27.784]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.784 --> 01:59:29.424]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.424 --> 01:59:30.725]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.725 --> 01:59:33.405]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.405 --> 01:59:34.826]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:59:35.086 --> 01:59:37.627]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.627 --> 01:59:42.248]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:42.248 --> 01:59:44.829]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:59:44.829 --> 01:59:48.690]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:48.690 --> 01:59:53.732]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:53.732 --> 01:59:56.133]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.133 --> 01:59:58.914]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:01.716 --> 02:00:03.698]  No warning signs, and I'm aware of specific threats.
[02:00:03.698 --> 02:00:07.082]  Man, it was a revelation that the White House had no intention of making public.
[02:00:07.082 --> 02:00:13.109]  President Bush was told in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning an attack involving a hijacker.
[02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:14.130]  Anybody could have predicted.
[02:00:14.130 --> 02:00:15.732]  Nobody in our government, at least.
[02:00:15.732 --> 02:00:16.673]  August 6, PDG.
[02:00:16.673 --> 02:00:21.198]  I believe the title was, Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.
[02:00:23.157 --> 02:00:27.260]  70% of family members' questions were never answered during the 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:30.142]  Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean said they were set up to fail.
[02:00:30.142 --> 02:00:31.383]  I mean, I'm a member of the Commission.
[02:00:31.383 --> 02:00:32.144]  It's a scam.
[02:00:32.144 --> 02:00:34.345]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[02:00:34.345 --> 02:00:36.927]  The questions, Mr. President.
[02:00:36.927 --> 02:00:40.149]  The questions.
[02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:44.992]  Building 7 ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse.
[02:00:44.992 --> 02:00:45.353]  Building 7.
[02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:49.811]  Well, no, there's number seven coming down.
[02:00:49.811 --> 02:00:57.992]  The excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished, and they wired very carefully for days, and it's a very careful operation.
[02:00:57.992 --> 02:01:08.335]  Third time today, in reminiscence of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[02:01:08.335 --> 02:01:11.655]  One of the things they do is pull it.
[02:01:11.655 --> 02:01:14.816]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building.
[02:01:15.496 --> 02:01:16.377]  Collapsing.
[02:01:16.377 --> 02:01:20.359]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[02:01:20.359 --> 02:01:22.481]  Well, only really what you already know.
[02:01:22.481 --> 02:01:24.182]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[02:01:24.182 --> 02:01:36.049]  We're getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7, in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[02:01:36.049 --> 02:01:38.171]  The Pentagon.
[02:01:38.171 --> 02:01:38.751]  Vanishing Airport.
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:45.404]  My close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.
[02:01:45.404 --> 02:01:55.570]  The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, and as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand.
[02:01:55.570 --> 02:02:07.138]  There are no large tail sections, wing sections, a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon.
[02:02:07.138 --> 02:02:08.259]  Firefighters and police
[02:02:09.369 --> 02:02:11.630]  Describing explosions.
[02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:12.570]  A lot of them.
[02:02:12.570 --> 02:02:15.052]  It looks sort of like the building just demolished.
[02:02:15.052 --> 02:02:18.133]  Even if there was no secondary explosives in the building.
[02:02:18.133 --> 02:02:19.293]  It sounded like gunfire.
[02:02:19.293 --> 02:02:21.074]  You know, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[02:02:21.074 --> 02:02:23.415]  And then all of a sudden, three big explosions.
[02:02:23.415 --> 02:02:27.177]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[02:02:39.248 --> 02:02:42.890]  To me it sounded like an explosion.
[02:02:42.890 --> 02:03:00.496]  Chief Albert Turi told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place, and then an hour after there was another explosion in one of the towers here.
[02:03:00.496 --> 02:03:04.498]  Sabel Edmonds, FBI translator, breaking her gag order.
[02:03:05.246 --> 02:03:09.230]  All our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban.
[02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:16.015]  We did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th.
[02:03:16.015 --> 02:03:21.660]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawapendi for kidney dialysis treatment.
[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.142]  The military had him surrounded.
[02:03:23.142 --> 02:03:29.367]  They were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after.
[02:03:29.367 --> 02:03:31.849]  NORAD standing down.
[02:03:31.849 --> 02:03:32.590]  Where were the planes?
[02:03:36.278 --> 02:03:39.320]  On now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11.
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.622]  A mysterious plane was seen flying right over the president's residence.
[02:03:42.622 --> 02:03:45.464]  The E-4Bs over New York and Washington.
[02:03:45.464 --> 02:03:47.646]  Otherwise known as the Doomsday Planes.
[02:03:47.646 --> 02:03:50.188]  It has never been officially explained.
[02:03:50.188 --> 02:03:55.131]  Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[02:03:55.131 --> 02:04:01.035]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls that the FBI says were never made.
[02:04:01.035 --> 02:04:02.196]  What happened during that call?
[02:04:02.196 --> 02:04:05.198]  This is the only information we have on these terrorists.
[02:04:07.302 --> 02:04:09.483]  She was able to call him twice.
[02:04:09.483 --> 02:04:13.525]  How she could pull that off, we don't know, but she did.
[02:04:13.525 --> 02:04:16.006]  These are the questions, Mr. President.
[02:04:16.006 --> 02:04:17.546]  These are the questions.
[02:04:17.546 --> 02:04:19.247]  They go on and on.
[02:04:19.247 --> 02:04:25.750]  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
[02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:34.313]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th, as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[02:04:34.313 --> 02:04:36.434]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[02:04:37.462 --> 02:04:40.786]  We have questions, Mr. President.
[02:04:40.786 --> 02:04:41.927]  Lots of questions.
[02:04:41.927 --> 02:04:45.391]  A lot of them are detailed in my letter.
[02:04:45.391 --> 02:04:48.034]  But trust me, there are hundreds worth of them.
[02:05:01.218 --> 02:05:04.801]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:05:04.801 --> 02:05:05.942]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:05:05.942 --> 02:05:10.506]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:05:10.506 --> 02:05:16.452]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:05:16.452 --> 02:05:18.593]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.593 --> 02:05:21.276]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.616 --> 02:05:28.122]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:28.122 --> 02:05:30.344]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:05:30.344 --> 02:05:35.668]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:05:35.668 --> 02:05:40.973]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:05:40.973 --> 02:05:46.117]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:05:46.317 --> 02:05:49.519]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[02:05:49.519 --> 02:05:52.521]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:05:52.521 --> 02:05:53.282]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:06:04.713 --> 02:06:05.974]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:05.974 --> 02:06:09.918]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.918 --> 02:06:12.300]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:18.025]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.025 --> 02:06:24.271]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.671 --> 02:06:30.653]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.653 --> 02:06:34.814]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.814 --> 02:06:39.115]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:39.115 --> 02:06:45.057]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.057 --> 02:06:48.618]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.618 --> 02:06:50.599]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.599 --> 02:06:51.019]  It's here.

[02:07:13.047 --> 02:07:19.089]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:07:19.089 --> 02:07:26.112]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:35.524]  We're American and be proud.

[02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:53.570]  Do you copy?
[02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:54.731]  Over.
[02:08:54.731 --> 02:08:56.512]  PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty, Almighty.
[02:08:56.512 --> 02:08:57.032]  I copy.
[02:08:57.032 --> 02:08:57.172]  Over.
[02:08:59.031 --> 02:09:12.697]  Well, Charlie Sheen, you haven't been back with us since about a year and a few months ago with your message to President Obama, your 20 minutes with the President that we just re-aired before you joined us.
[02:09:12.697 --> 02:09:15.558]  It's great to have you, Charlie.
[02:09:15.558 --> 02:09:17.019]  It's still topical.
[02:09:17.019 --> 02:09:19.780]  It's a timeless message.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.220]  It's a timeless message.
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.641]  It's still right there in the fold.
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:24.700]  Well it certainly is.
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:35.525]  What's your message to President Obama refusing to answer the bullet points that you put down in that key document of the questions surrounding the tragic attacks of 9-11?
[02:09:37.042 --> 02:09:52.414]  Well, I would say to B.O., like, how much faith can I possibly have in you to run this entire country when 20 questions from a high school dropout sitcom actor appear to be too much to handle for you and your staff?
[02:09:52.414 --> 02:09:55.356]  It's like, you've had almost two years to deal with this.
[02:09:55.356 --> 02:09:56.997]  I wrote them in one hour.
[02:09:56.997 --> 02:10:01.721]  And it's like, you know, sorry, but you, sir, are obviously a coward in a cheap suit.
[02:10:03.027 --> 02:10:04.828]  And the bottom line, Alex, is I'm still here.
[02:10:04.828 --> 02:10:07.089]  His schedule is public knowledge.
[02:10:07.089 --> 02:10:09.470]  It's rocket science, this is not.
[02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:11.071]  Quit hiding, it's embarrassing, dude.
[02:10:11.071 --> 02:10:12.431]  Next subject.
[02:10:12.431 --> 02:10:17.513]  Well, just briefly getting back to Obama for a moment, we did a lot of research for those 20 questions.
[02:10:17.513 --> 02:10:25.297]  Things like, Mr. President, 6 of the 10 commissioners and most of the lawyers on the 9-11 Commission say that the official story is a lie.
[02:10:25.297 --> 02:10:26.918]  Please respond to this.
[02:10:26.918 --> 02:10:29.579]  Or, why did Building 7 fall at free-fall speed?
[02:10:29.579 --> 02:10:30.799]  Please respond to this.
[02:10:30.799 --> 02:10:32.180]  But they don't want to respond to it.
[02:10:33.945 --> 02:10:43.070]  Yeah, well, I think somebody is running at him right now with a tape recording of what I just spoke and said, they're on to us, man.
[02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:44.330]  He's back.
[02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:45.971]  We thought he was dead.
[02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:46.911]  Nice try, fellas.
[02:10:46.911 --> 02:10:49.793]  Anyway, enough of that.
[02:10:49.793 --> 02:10:50.633]  They know the score on that.
[02:10:50.633 --> 02:11:01.679]  Let's get to more contemporary stuff, because what's going on and people are so mystified by this odyssey that refuses to stop calling itself Charlie Sheen.
[02:11:02.569 --> 02:11:03.549]  Absolutely, Charlie.
[02:11:03.549 --> 02:11:05.290]  It was good to see you a few weeks ago at your home.
[02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:06.190]  Likewise.
[02:11:06.190 --> 02:11:07.351]  Likewise, too.
[02:11:07.351 --> 02:11:08.131]  You are looking great.
[02:11:08.131 --> 02:11:10.392]  You're completely clean, aren't you?
[02:11:10.392 --> 02:11:10.592]  100%.
[02:11:10.592 --> 02:11:12.112]  You know, here's your first pee test.
[02:11:12.112 --> 02:11:13.393]  Next one goes in your mouth.
[02:11:13.393 --> 02:11:14.293]  No, you won't get high.
[02:11:14.293 --> 02:11:16.374]  It's all good.
[02:11:16.374 --> 02:11:17.514]  It's all good, guys.
[02:11:17.514 --> 02:11:18.514]  Quit panicking.
[02:11:18.514 --> 02:11:19.155]  Quit panicking.
[02:11:19.155 --> 02:11:21.655]  No panic, no judgment.
[02:11:21.655 --> 02:11:25.437]  And you're working out even a couple times a day sometimes.
[02:11:25.437 --> 02:11:28.398]  Well, yeah, but there's only one time in the gym if you catch my drift.
[02:11:31.104 --> 02:11:32.224]  We're not live, are we?
[02:11:32.224 --> 02:11:33.245]  No, we're live.
[02:11:33.245 --> 02:11:48.028]  Charlie, speaking of that, the media, you don't want to go there, you don't want to ever defend yourself, but you've told me privately most of the stuff, most of the names, it's not true, but what is going on with the women in your life?
[02:11:48.028 --> 02:11:49.349]  The goddesses.
[02:11:49.349 --> 02:11:51.369]  Alex, the goddesses.
[02:11:51.369 --> 02:11:52.670]  Let me just say this about the goddesses.
[02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:53.550]  I don't believe the term is
[02:11:54.671 --> 02:11:55.631]  It's good enough.
[02:11:55.631 --> 02:11:56.332]  It's good enough.
[02:11:56.332 --> 02:12:03.014]  But when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions, you must use the best choice available, right?
[02:12:03.014 --> 02:12:04.074]  Yes.
[02:12:04.074 --> 02:12:07.355]  So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm all for three with marriage.
[02:12:07.355 --> 02:12:08.916]  With an excuse, but...
[02:12:09.956 --> 02:12:12.317]  Like in baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie.
[02:12:12.317 --> 02:12:12.917]  Never has.
[02:12:12.917 --> 02:12:18.118]  So, what we all have is a marriage of the heart.
[02:12:18.118 --> 02:12:19.518]  Of the hearts.
[02:12:19.518 --> 02:12:31.561]  And, you know, to sully, contaminate, or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I won't... Yeah, you know, leave to the amateurs and the Bible grippers.
[02:12:31.561 --> 02:12:33.922]  The Bible grippers.
[02:12:33.922 --> 02:12:36.343]  And then I just gotta add this.
[02:12:36.343 --> 02:12:37.943]  There was a whole firestorm yesterday about
[02:12:39.441 --> 02:12:51.104]  Brooke, being a part of our crew, and let me just say this, all I'm going to say about it is that where there were four, there are now three.
[02:12:51.104 --> 02:12:53.345]  Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck on your travels.
[02:12:53.345 --> 02:12:55.425]  You're going to need it.
[02:12:55.425 --> 02:12:57.306]  Badly.
[02:12:57.306 --> 02:13:00.827]  So, Brooke did go along with you, but she's not there now?
[02:13:00.827 --> 02:13:03.507]  No, she's not there now, and we are, and I don't know, winning, anyone?
[02:13:08.211 --> 02:13:09.212]  Rhymes with winning.
[02:13:09.212 --> 02:13:09.472]  Anyone?
[02:13:09.472 --> 02:13:11.653]  Yeah, that would be us.
[02:13:11.653 --> 02:13:12.233]  Sorry, man.
[02:13:12.233 --> 02:13:13.053]  Didn't make the rules.
[02:13:13.053 --> 02:13:13.974]  Oops.
[02:13:13.974 --> 02:13:21.497]  Well, Charlie, I've known you for six, six and a half years or so, and I knew you when you were completely clean, and then I've known you since.
[02:13:21.497 --> 02:13:29.221]  But the point is, now, I've never seen you, when I was out at your house and talked to you on the phone, so energized as you are now.
[02:13:29.221 --> 02:13:34.263]  I mean, you're on fire, as Nails told the news yesterday.
[02:13:34.263 --> 02:13:35.624]  I mean, I agree with that description.
[02:13:37.025 --> 02:13:43.948]  Well, I think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered because he got it right that I'm not, you know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' Bayonets, you know?
[02:13:43.948 --> 02:13:46.549]  I am battle-tested Bayonets, bro.
[02:13:46.549 --> 02:13:48.430]  I'm, you know, I'm tired.
[02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:59.935]  I am so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second, and I'm not perfect and bitchin' and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn because look what I'm dealing with, man.
[02:13:59.935 --> 02:14:01.196]  I'm dealing with fools and trolls.
[02:14:01.983 --> 02:14:10.711]  You know, dealing with soft targets and it's just, you know, it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns.
[02:14:10.711 --> 02:14:21.801]  I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and, you know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and they say, I can't process it.
[02:14:21.801 --> 02:14:22.982]  Well, no, and you never will.
[02:14:22.982 --> 02:14:23.763]  Stop trying.
[02:14:23.763 --> 02:14:25.044]  Just sit back and enjoy the show.
[02:14:27.492 --> 02:14:29.853]  Wow, I am speechless.
[02:14:29.853 --> 02:14:44.599]  Later we're going to get into Apocalypse Now, but what comes to mind is when we were there a few weeks ago watching it in your home theater, when Colonel Kurtz is saying, you can kill me, but you can't... You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.
[02:14:44.599 --> 02:14:45.299]  Boom.
[02:14:45.299 --> 02:14:46.060]  That's the whole movie.
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:46.540]  That's life.
[02:14:47.685 --> 02:14:49.006]  That's life.
[02:14:49.006 --> 02:14:50.206]  There's nobility in that.
[02:14:50.206 --> 02:14:51.047]  There's focus.
[02:14:51.047 --> 02:14:51.747]  It's genuine.
[02:14:51.747 --> 02:14:53.288]  It's crystal and it's pure.
[02:14:53.288 --> 02:14:55.109]  And it's available to everybody.
[02:14:55.109 --> 02:15:00.652]  You can shut your traps and put down your McDonald's, your vaccines, your Rush Weekly, your TMZ, and the rest of it.
[02:15:00.652 --> 02:15:03.373]  You know, and focus on something that matters.
[02:15:03.373 --> 02:15:08.676]  But you can't focus on something that matters if all you've done is sleep for 40 years.
[02:15:08.676 --> 02:15:10.257]  Funny how sleep rhymes with sheep.
[02:15:11.164 --> 02:15:11.805]  You know?
[02:15:11.805 --> 02:15:13.667]  Anyway, we're getting off topic.
[02:15:13.667 --> 02:15:15.388]  We don't have a topic.
[02:15:15.388 --> 02:15:16.629]  We don't care anymore, Alex.
[02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:17.230]  We don't care.
[02:15:17.230 --> 02:15:19.172]  We're going to talk about this work thing, bro.
[02:15:19.172 --> 02:15:23.056]  Let's get to the work business, because there's been a lot of speculation, a lot of rumors.
[02:15:23.056 --> 02:15:24.097]  Imagine that with the media.
[02:15:24.633 --> 02:15:32.937]  Well sure, let's go over that because when I was there two weeks ago at your house, you looked great, totally clean, you were working out super hard.
[02:15:32.937 --> 02:15:36.219]  I went and worked out with you at that private gym.
[02:15:36.219 --> 02:15:39.340]  I mean they put you through an incredible workout.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:44.183]  You're there exercising in the pool later and you're saying, look I'm ready to go to work.
[02:15:44.183 --> 02:15:44.763]  I'm ready to go
[02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:45.884]  Right now.
[02:15:45.884 --> 02:15:48.306]  And then they add the lie that, oh, you don't have a hernia.
[02:15:48.306 --> 02:15:48.826]  Well, you know what?
[02:15:48.826 --> 02:15:50.287]  I've seen your hernia.
[02:15:50.287 --> 02:15:54.651]  I've got the same hernia in my belly button and your hernia was hurt.
[02:15:54.651 --> 02:15:59.054]  But again, you don't want to defend yourself on that and tell folks the truth about it.
[02:15:59.054 --> 02:16:06.220]  But the point is, is that it seems like there's some people in your life that are trying to demonize you.
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:09.703]  They're doing these vanity cards talking about how they're going to outlive you.
[02:16:09.703 --> 02:16:11.264]  It seems pretty darn aggressive.
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:13.482]  Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card.
[02:16:13.482 --> 02:16:15.785]  In fact, I went straight home with that one and just dispelled that.
[02:16:15.785 --> 02:16:22.254]  That was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.
[02:16:22.254 --> 02:16:23.515]  But I'm excited to get back.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.421]  I don't think so.
[02:16:42.461 --> 02:16:43.961]  But you're ready to go back to work right now?
[02:17:09.701 --> 02:17:19.471]  Yeah, but Alex, I've got to tell you, I'm tired of being told, like, oh, you can't talk about that, you can't talk about that, mole, S-H-I-T.
[02:17:19.471 --> 02:17:31.563]  Let me just say this, it's nothing out of the deplorable of a certain Haim Levine, yeah, that's Chuck's real name, mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.
[02:17:32.515 --> 02:17:40.638]  Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind cannot process.
[02:17:40.638 --> 02:17:50.523]  Okay, last I checked, I'm, uh, I've spent, I think, close to the last decade, I don't know, effortlessly and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.
[02:17:50.523 --> 02:17:56.885]  And the gratitude I get in this, get his, this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to write.
[02:17:56.885 --> 02:17:59.086]  Clearly someone who believes he is above the law.
[02:17:59.086 --> 02:18:00.567]  Well, you've been warned, dude.
[02:18:00.567 --> 02:18:00.827]  Bring it.
[02:18:02.403 --> 02:18:16.793]  Charlie, everybody that I know that knows you, and I know you well, talks about how behind the scenes you give incredible amounts of money to charity, you help people, you give things to everybody, you go out and help firemen and school children.
[02:18:16.793 --> 02:18:31.542]  I mean, you genuinely are a nice guy, but you've always just let people attack you and lie about you, and in the years I've known you, and in the years of people that have known you for decades, they say Charlie is on fire, and after he came out of what he's been in the last seven months, he is
[02:18:32.483 --> 02:18:36.524]  He is not putting up with people trying to push him around anymore.
[02:18:36.524 --> 02:18:37.764]  Is that fair to say?
[02:18:37.764 --> 02:18:39.505]  It's, yeah, it's an understatement.
[02:18:39.505 --> 02:18:42.446]  You know, it's, um, I just, I'm sorry, man.
[02:18:42.446 --> 02:18:52.528]  I got, I got, I got magic and I got poetry at my fingertips and I'm, you know, most of the time, and this is, you know, this includes naps, you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm an F-18, bro.
[02:18:52.528 --> 02:18:57.269]  And I will, I will destroy you in the air and I will, I will, I will deploy my ordnance to the ground.
[02:18:57.269 --> 02:18:59.850]  Are you going to announce your new tattoo here on air?
[02:19:01.311 --> 02:19:01.831]  Yeah, why not?
[02:19:01.831 --> 02:19:05.233]  Because it's just pure, pure and complete gnarly-isms.
[02:19:05.233 --> 02:19:24.343]  Yeah, I sat with two, hey, coincidence, F-18 Top Gun radical fired napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the attack sequence, the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.
[02:19:24.343 --> 02:19:30.266]  And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above.
[02:19:30.946 --> 02:19:36.330]  And it's the banner from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims.
[02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:41.214]  But there's also falling from it is the apple from the Giving Tree.
[02:19:41.214 --> 02:19:42.115]  There's my life.
[02:19:42.115 --> 02:19:42.956]  Deal with it.
[02:19:42.956 --> 02:19:44.337]  Oh wait, can't process it.
[02:19:44.337 --> 02:19:45.718]  Losers winning.
[02:19:45.718 --> 02:19:47.219]  Goodbye.
[02:19:47.219 --> 02:19:49.821]  When are we going to see this tattoo?
[02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:59.669]  Well, if my man Steve is listening, I'm sure it'll be headed to you in just a matter of moments.
[02:20:00.816 --> 02:20:01.857]  Well, that's awesome, Charlie.
[02:20:01.857 --> 02:20:07.200]  I know you've got some surprises coming up in the next few weeks, but we'll let you roll those surprises out.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:16.606]  Moving on along here, Major League Three, your other two were giant hits, and I knew the inside baseball of some of the planning for that.
[02:20:16.606 --> 02:20:20.288]  You told me about it a while back, but now it looks like it's really starting to come together.
[02:20:20.288 --> 02:20:24.211]  Tell us about when we're going to be looking for Major League Three and who's going to be in it.
[02:20:25.523 --> 02:20:25.824]  I don't know.
[02:20:25.824 --> 02:20:26.424]  I haven't read it.
[02:20:26.424 --> 02:20:26.944]  I don't care.
[02:20:26.944 --> 02:20:34.830]  It's being directed and written by a genius named David Ward who, oh, I don't know, won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting.
[02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:40.254]  And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League.
[02:20:41.275 --> 02:20:46.376]  A lot of people think the movie's called Wild Thing, as they should, but whatever.
[02:20:46.376 --> 02:20:47.656]  I agreed to do it.
[02:20:47.656 --> 02:20:54.778]  There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson, a wonderful man, and Morgan Creek, a great company, need to work out.
[02:20:54.778 --> 02:20:56.398]  If they want me in it, it's a smash.
[02:20:56.398 --> 02:21:01.699]  If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.
[02:21:01.699 --> 02:21:07.000]  Oh boy, I tell you, because the word in the news is, I mean, all over the LA Times, New York Times, is that it's a done deal.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:07.860]  You're in it and it's coming.
[02:21:08.556 --> 02:21:13.539]  Wow, well they didn't, they didn't, uh, I didn't get that text yet, you know?
[02:21:13.539 --> 02:21:17.362]  Well, as we know, the mainstream media gets a lot of things wrong, Charlie.
[02:21:17.362 --> 02:21:18.823]  A side issue... No way!
[02:21:18.823 --> 02:21:19.343]  No way!
[02:21:19.343 --> 02:21:21.965]  Those guys, damn!
[02:21:21.965 --> 02:21:27.909]  Why did you decide to, uh, you know, basically unleash yourself here on this broadcast?
[02:21:27.909 --> 02:21:29.230]  Because I'm just, um...
[02:21:30.327 --> 02:21:32.829]  I don't know why give an interview when you can leave a warning.
[02:21:32.829 --> 02:21:37.173]  I'm just not a fair game.
[02:21:37.173 --> 02:21:39.214]  I'm not a soft target.
[02:21:39.214 --> 02:21:40.115]  It's over.
[02:21:40.115 --> 02:21:41.276]  There's a new sheriff in town.
[02:21:43.177 --> 02:21:45.159]  And he has an army of assassins.
[02:21:45.159 --> 02:21:49.082]  Oh, we must speak of the Vatican assassins, yes.
[02:21:49.082 --> 02:21:57.229]  I don't read anything after it comes out, because I will not waste my precious time on such ridiculous nonsense.
[02:21:57.229 --> 02:22:02.233]  But I understand, according to you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins.
[02:22:02.233 --> 02:22:05.396]  And I'm like, guys, it's right there in the thing.
[02:22:05.396 --> 02:22:06.717]  Duh, we work for the Pope.
[02:22:06.717 --> 02:22:07.637]  We murder people.
[02:22:07.637 --> 02:22:08.738]  We're Vatican assassins.
[02:22:08.738 --> 02:22:10.039]  How complicated can it be?
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:11.881]  Oh my gosh.
[02:22:11.881 --> 02:22:23.748]  What they're not ready for is guys like you and I, and Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my life, um, that we are high priest, uh, Vatican assassin warlocks.
[02:22:23.748 --> 02:22:26.069]  Boom, press that, people.
[02:22:26.069 --> 02:22:27.550]  See where that goes.
[02:22:28.383 --> 02:22:33.846]  Oh man, I tell you Charlie, you... and of course, we can tell the inside baseball.
[02:22:33.846 --> 02:22:35.527]  It's kind of a sick joke for me.
[02:22:35.527 --> 02:22:39.508]  One of my sickest forms of entertainment is people that make stuff up about me.
[02:22:39.508 --> 02:22:41.109]  Just a pure baloney.
[02:22:41.109 --> 02:22:46.932]  And one time I was at your house and I was showing him stuff where they're claiming that we work for the Pope and stuff and me and Charlie are Vatican assassins.
[02:22:46.932 --> 02:22:49.653]  So that's kind of the roots of that for the media.
[02:22:49.653 --> 02:22:52.015]  And Charlie called the great
[02:22:53.075 --> 02:22:56.177]  San Francisco Giants closer when he was visiting his house.
[02:22:56.177 --> 02:22:57.779]  Brian Wilson.
[02:22:57.779 --> 02:23:00.260]  Brian Wilson.
[02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:01.161]  What was the full quote?
[02:23:01.161 --> 02:23:03.963]  You called him just an awesome Vatican assassin.
[02:23:03.963 --> 02:23:04.664]  Yeah, I did.
[02:23:04.664 --> 02:23:06.385]  Yeah, because he's nothing shy of that.
[02:23:06.385 --> 02:23:11.349]  And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people.
[02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.909]  Embarrass them.
[02:23:11.909 --> 02:23:14.151]  Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process.
[02:23:14.151 --> 02:23:19.275]  And he's as radical as you think he might be.
[02:23:20.513 --> 02:23:27.198]  And if he chooses to do so, he will stop your heart, and he will behead you.
[02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:29.200]  And all in service to the Pope?
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:29.860]  Absolutely.
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:31.201]  That's what we do.
[02:23:31.201 --> 02:23:32.302]  That's what we do.
[02:23:32.302 --> 02:23:37.986]  Alright, getting into Apocalypse Now, that's one of the things, it's probably my favorite movie.
[02:23:37.986 --> 02:23:42.249]  I know it's yours, of course your dad stars in it, you were there for months during the production of it.
[02:23:42.249 --> 02:23:46.793]  Put a big mark on your soul.
[02:23:46.793 --> 02:23:47.914]  Apocalypse Now, my friend.
[02:23:49.204 --> 02:23:54.508]  I mean, there's not much you can say other than genius represents life.
[02:23:54.508 --> 02:24:00.093]  Apocalypse will teach you how to live inside of a moment, between a moment.
[02:24:00.093 --> 02:24:09.861]  And that's where life is, because, you know, I'm not just Captain Willard, I'm not just my dad, and I'm heading up the river to kill another part of me, which is Kurt.
[02:24:09.861 --> 02:24:11.722]  I am every character in between.
[02:24:11.722 --> 02:24:14.444]  Save for that little weirdo with his gut strapped in, begging for water.
[02:24:14.444 --> 02:24:14.885]  That's not me.
[02:24:16.112 --> 02:24:24.215]  But, you know, there are parts of me that are, that is hopper, because my, my, my, my motto now is you either love or you hate, and you must do so violently.
[02:24:24.215 --> 02:24:32.037]  And the reason you must hate violently is because, and you have to hate everybody that's not in your family, because they're there to destroy your family.
[02:24:32.037 --> 02:24:34.938]  And they will, and it will come at you in all forms and shapes.
[02:24:34.938 --> 02:24:36.879]  And therefore, there's nothing in the middle.
[02:24:36.879 --> 02:24:38.259]  I don't live in the middle anymore.
[02:24:38.259 --> 02:24:39.920]  That's where you get slaughtered.
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:40.920]  That's where you get embarrassed.
[02:24:41.684 --> 02:24:43.426]  In front of the prom queen.
[02:24:43.426 --> 02:24:45.667]  And I just, it's just not, it's just not an option.
[02:24:45.667 --> 02:24:52.153]  So, you know, within that is tremendous focus and tremendous clarity and tremendous peace.
[02:24:52.153 --> 02:24:56.136]  Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions.
[02:24:56.136 --> 02:25:01.440]  If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.402]  And people say, oh, you know, you've got to work through your resentments.
[02:25:04.402 --> 02:25:06.184]  Yeah, no, I'm going to hang on to them.
[02:25:06.184 --> 02:25:07.485]  They're going to fuel my attack.
[02:25:08.522 --> 02:25:15.066]  And they're going to fuel the battle, for I have my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers, because they're all around you.
[02:25:15.066 --> 02:25:16.867]  Anyway, I thought you were just messing with one dude.
[02:25:16.867 --> 02:25:17.487]  Sorry.
[02:25:17.487 --> 02:25:19.648]  Winning!
[02:25:19.648 --> 02:25:23.030]  Well, Charlie, I mean, I tell you, it is amazing.
[02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:29.874]  And I just appreciate you coming on today so folks can really hear the energized, unleashed Charlie Sheen.
[02:25:29.874 --> 02:25:37.778]  You wanted to talk about AA, because, you know, when I was at your house, I said, man, great job being completely sober and, you know, how important it was.
[02:25:38.038 --> 02:25:44.624]  But I can't use the word sober because that's a term from those people and I'm just, I've cleansed myself.
[02:25:44.624 --> 02:25:52.030]  I closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease and addiction and obsession.
[02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:52.390]  It's just...
[02:25:53.431 --> 02:25:56.093]  It's just the work of sissies.
[02:25:56.093 --> 02:25:59.356]  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning, you know?
[02:25:59.356 --> 02:26:08.362]  This bootleg cult, you know, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, Alex supports a 5% success rate.
[02:26:08.362 --> 02:26:09.783]  My success rate is 100%.
[02:26:09.783 --> 02:26:10.264]  Do the math!
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.643]  Take, for instance, its founder, a death-written, broken-down plagiarist.
[02:26:16.643 --> 02:26:18.624]  Stayed high on acid until the day he died.
[02:26:18.624 --> 02:26:21.286]  I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies.
[02:26:21.286 --> 02:26:26.589]  And then, Alex, try to get your mind around this as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches.
[02:26:28.010 --> 02:26:34.733]  Their entire manifesto is built upon a complete and total surrender or the concept of complete and total surrender.
[02:26:34.733 --> 02:26:38.254]  They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.
[02:26:38.254 --> 02:26:42.456]  In 22 years, the only winners I can locate are Toothless Warren.
[02:26:42.456 --> 02:26:47.719]  We're either driving a convertible van or living like trolls under some abandoned bridge.
[02:26:47.719 --> 02:26:52.040]  Another one of their stupid mottos, Alex is, uh, don't be special, be one of us.
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:55.362]  Newsflash, I am special and I will never be one of you.
[02:26:57.210 --> 02:26:57.750]  There it is.
[02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:59.892]  You sound like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:26:59.892 --> 02:27:01.153]  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson.
[02:27:01.153 --> 02:27:05.056]  He was a pussy.
[02:27:05.056 --> 02:27:08.198]  No, but I dare anyone to debate me on things.
[02:27:08.198 --> 02:27:10.240]  Debate me on AA right now.
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:10.820]  I have a disease.
[02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:11.161]  Bullshit.
[02:27:11.161 --> 02:27:12.422]  I cured it with my brain.
[02:27:12.422 --> 02:27:14.303]  With my mind.
[02:27:14.303 --> 02:27:14.723]  I'm cured.
[02:27:14.723 --> 02:27:15.824]  I'm done.
[02:27:15.824 --> 02:27:19.247]  Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.
[02:27:19.247 --> 02:27:21.088]  Well, you know, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.
[02:27:21.088 --> 02:27:25.792]  I'm going to hang out with these two smoking hotties and fly privately around the world.
[02:27:26.596 --> 02:27:28.817]  It might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.
[02:27:28.817 --> 02:27:30.158]  I'm done.
[02:27:30.158 --> 02:27:30.438]  I'm done.
[02:27:30.438 --> 02:27:30.838]  It's on.
[02:27:30.838 --> 02:27:31.038]  Bring it.
[02:27:31.038 --> 02:27:31.418]  As I say.
[02:27:31.418 --> 02:27:31.878]  I ain't hiding.
[02:27:31.878 --> 02:27:34.039]  And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently.
[02:27:52.930 --> 02:27:58.214]  If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.
[02:27:58.214 --> 02:28:00.456]  In the Info War?
[02:28:00.456 --> 02:28:01.497]  In the Info War.
[02:28:01.497 --> 02:28:02.578]  Absolutely.
[02:28:02.578 --> 02:28:03.979]  Yes.
[02:28:03.979 --> 02:28:05.961]  The media would certainly try to spin that, you mean.
[02:28:05.961 --> 02:28:07.502]  Of course.
[02:28:07.502 --> 02:28:08.463]  Wow.
[02:28:08.463 --> 02:28:09.583]  We're going to come back, Charlie.
[02:28:09.583 --> 02:28:14.407]  We've only got two more points to get to, and then we're going to bring up a mutual friend and another... Awesome.
[02:28:14.407 --> 02:28:15.048]  Awesome.
[02:28:15.048 --> 02:28:16.029]  Another Vatican assassin.
[02:28:16.029 --> 02:28:21.053]  This guy's got more notches on his belt than, I don't know who, Black Bart, you know?
[02:28:22.270 --> 02:28:27.295]  So we're going to break here in a moment and let you take a break, but come right back to you, Charlie, for a few minutes.
[02:28:27.295 --> 02:28:29.437]  Then we're going to introduce him with you at the same time.
[02:28:29.437 --> 02:28:30.979]  Then we'll go on with him alone.
[02:28:30.979 --> 02:28:35.363]  But there are a few other points here.
[02:28:35.363 --> 02:28:35.843]  Jaws.
[02:28:35.843 --> 02:28:37.485]  Let's start talking about Jaws.
[02:28:37.485 --> 02:28:38.446]  How great that was.
[02:28:38.446 --> 02:28:43.931]  You thought to, a few days ago, go out on the Pacific Ocean in a big yacht while watching Jaws.
[02:28:43.931 --> 02:28:46.714]  And you said the horizon matched the television perfectly.
[02:28:47.202 --> 02:28:47.962]  It was incredible.
[02:28:47.962 --> 02:28:52.464]  If you haven't done this, I urge you to make plans and do this tonight.
[02:28:52.464 --> 02:28:55.905]  What I wanted to do was I wanted to watch Jaws on the ocean in the dark and be afraid.
[02:28:55.905 --> 02:28:58.886]  I wanted to embrace the fear and relive the movie.
[02:28:58.886 --> 02:29:03.148]  What I didn't count on was it basically turned into Star Tours.
[02:29:03.148 --> 02:29:06.649]  It turned into 4D because there were moments during the Indianapolis speech
[02:29:07.709 --> 02:29:13.313]  Um, which is about looking fear right down the barrel, which nobody, again, understands anymore.
[02:29:13.313 --> 02:29:15.414]  Uh, where their horizon matched ours.
[02:29:15.414 --> 02:29:19.776]  We were basically in the Orca, listening to the speech.
[02:29:19.776 --> 02:29:21.517]  This is me not on drugs, bro.
[02:29:21.517 --> 02:29:23.799]  As I said, the first one's free, the next one goes in your mouth.
[02:29:24.625 --> 02:29:26.807]  So, it was an incredible experience.
[02:29:26.807 --> 02:29:32.613]  I felt, you know, I of course took full credit, but I had no idea that the fourth dimensional aspect of it would occur.
[02:29:32.613 --> 02:29:41.361]  And it occurred in such a magical sense that we all just sat there in awe and with our jaws open.
[02:29:41.361 --> 02:29:41.921]  Incredible.
[02:29:41.921 --> 02:29:43.183]  Charlie, stay there.
[02:29:43.183 --> 02:29:44.143]  Take a break.
[02:29:44.143 --> 02:29:46.145]  We'll be right back with you and Nail.
[02:29:46.145 --> 02:29:46.566]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.377 --> 02:29:55.304]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.304 --> 02:29:57.989]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:05.493]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.493 --> 02:30:06.413]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.413 --> 02:30:09.836]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.836 --> 02:30:10.696]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.696 --> 02:30:15.599]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.599 --> 02:30:16.340]  It's true.
[02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:21.203]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.203 --> 02:30:22.043]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.043 --> 02:30:25.626]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.626 --> 02:30:29.328]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.528 --> 02:30:30.308]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.308 --> 02:30:33.070]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:36.752]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.752 --> 02:30:37.552]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.552 --> 02:30:41.694]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.694 --> 02:30:46.757]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:05.754]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:05.754 --> 02:32:08.998]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:08.998 --> 02:32:13.783]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:13.783 --> 02:32:20.189]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.189 --> 02:32:22.432]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:22.952 --> 02:32:24.453]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:32:24.453 --> 02:32:25.713]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.713 --> 02:32:27.974]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:49.147]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:32:49.147 --> 02:32:58.255]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:28.397 --> 02:33:38.301]  All right, Charlie Sheen is our guest.
[02:33:38.301 --> 02:33:40.982]  In a few minutes, we're going to bring in Nails here.
[02:33:40.982 --> 02:33:51.427]  Lenny Dykstra, center fielder for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies, three-time MLB All-Star, 1990-94-95 World Series champion, 1986 with the Mets.
[02:33:51.427 --> 02:33:55.528]  And by the way, you haven't heard the media since he beat JP Morgan in court and beat over 200 SEC probes.
[02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:58.571]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:58.571 --> 02:34:01.314]  They basically set him up, and I've done the research.
[02:34:01.314 --> 02:34:05.339]  He's one of the guys that's been beating the banks with the big mortgage gate situation.
[02:34:05.339 --> 02:34:06.441]  They set him up.
[02:34:06.441 --> 02:34:07.462]  He'll be joining us coming up.
[02:34:07.462 --> 02:34:12.408]  But to talk about baseball, then after Charlie leaves, we'll get into his story, and then next week, a full hour with him.
[02:34:12.408 --> 02:34:15.112]  But Charlie, you've got a note that you wanted to read here on air.
[02:34:16.385 --> 02:34:20.367]  Yeah, yes I do, and it's from one of my goddesses.
[02:34:20.367 --> 02:34:28.032]  It's from the Natty, and it just says, this is how blessed and perfect my insane life is.
[02:34:28.032 --> 02:34:34.676]  My monkey man, my king, my high priest, ninja warlock, I love you violently with the fire of one thousand suns.
[02:34:34.676 --> 02:34:40.019]  Thank you for sharing your wisdom, experience, Jedi mind powers, amazing humor, and unconditional love.
[02:34:40.019 --> 02:34:43.021]  I am truly honored to not walk behind or in front of you.
[02:34:43.721 --> 02:34:45.542]  But by your side.
[02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:55.687]  And with a capital C. Now, Charlie, I know that I made the joke that time about the Vatican Assassins with you and you don't care if people run with it and them saying we're warlocks.
[02:34:55.687 --> 02:34:59.329]  I understand that's a funny joke to you, but they'll take it serious.
[02:34:59.329 --> 02:35:04.231]  Actually, one time I was at your house, you were reading the Citizen Rulebook and talking about our God-given rights.
[02:35:04.231 --> 02:35:06.893]  What is your view about heaven and hell and life?
[02:35:06.893 --> 02:35:09.154]  Because in person, you're a very loving, good person.
[02:35:10.137 --> 02:35:15.259]  Yeah, I mean, I find heaven in the eyes of my family.
[02:35:15.259 --> 02:35:16.960]  That includes all of them.
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:21.701]  And I find hell in the eyes of everyone who tries to disrupt that love.
[02:35:21.701 --> 02:35:22.002]  Period.
[02:35:22.002 --> 02:35:22.942]  The end.
[02:35:22.942 --> 02:35:24.403]  Can't find that in the Bible, but whatever.
[02:35:24.403 --> 02:35:28.964]  It's really kind of boring and long and talking snakes and wow.
[02:35:28.964 --> 02:35:29.364]  Wow.
[02:35:29.364 --> 02:35:32.446]  We give up all Sunday for that garbage.
[02:35:32.446 --> 02:35:33.206]  Well, I miss it a lot.
[02:35:33.206 --> 02:35:34.987]  I miss it a lot of good sports people.
[02:35:34.987 --> 02:35:35.767]  Lots of good sports.
[02:35:36.067 --> 02:35:39.410]  Well, Charlie, I'm just glad that you are clean.
[02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:42.793]  And as you're saying, never again, totally committed.
[02:35:42.793 --> 02:35:46.276]  This is it.
[02:35:46.276 --> 02:35:46.957]  Right now it is.
[02:35:46.957 --> 02:35:47.417]  I don't know, man.
[02:35:47.417 --> 02:35:48.358]  I'm just saying.
[02:35:48.358 --> 02:35:50.881]  I just don't subscribe to any part of the model.
[02:35:50.881 --> 02:35:52.482]  So, I am my own man.
[02:35:52.482 --> 02:35:55.865]  I make a decision that day and, you know, inside the moment.
[02:35:55.865 --> 02:35:58.468]  And I live with them, good or bad.
[02:35:58.468 --> 02:35:59.669]  They're mostly good, though.
[02:36:01.305 --> 02:36:25.257]  Well, Charlie, before we bring Nails up here and talk about the baseball stuff you guys are doing and working with kids in the community like you did a few weeks ago, and telling kids not to use drugs, what's your bottom line on any other points, because I know you've told me you're not going to be doing a lot of interviews, for anything else you want to impart to folks out there?
[02:36:25.257 --> 02:36:28.919]  I want to see if Nails can get his mind, his beautiful mind around this one, because
[02:36:32.078 --> 02:36:36.941]  I look at the game of baseball and I'm reminded of a quote that I wrote.
[02:36:36.941 --> 02:36:43.764]  It is a perfect game where it's a poetic ebb and flow, can silence the loudest crying infant in the universe into a smile-draped nap.
[02:36:46.957 --> 02:36:47.658]  That's pretty heavy.
[02:36:47.658 --> 02:36:48.939]  It's not bad.
[02:36:48.939 --> 02:36:53.363]  It goes on and on, but, you know, people will just tune out at some point because they're stupid.
[02:36:53.363 --> 02:36:57.907]  Well, let me tell you, the voice messages you've left me that are private, that's some pretty powerful poetry.
[02:36:57.907 --> 02:36:59.228]  I mean, you're on fire.
[02:36:59.228 --> 02:37:02.591]  I mean, you're not reading poetry aloud in a voice.
[02:37:02.591 --> 02:37:10.017]  You are literally spewing pretty powerful poetry, even more powerful than what I've heard here today about Jaws, and that was pretty epic.
[02:37:10.017 --> 02:37:11.579]  I mean, Charlie, you're on fire.
[02:37:12.455 --> 02:37:31.526]  Well, I've been, um, you know, I was, uh, my passion was asleep for a long time, but like I told Dan Patrick, one of my favorite people alive, uh, he's an absolute ninja warrior, Vatican assassin, um, borderline, borderline warlock, um, you know, it's, um, they couldn't, they did, they couldn't extinguish my pilot light.
[02:37:31.526 --> 02:37:33.307]  And that was a mistake.
[02:37:33.307 --> 02:37:34.368]  That was their mistake.
[02:37:35.749 --> 02:37:45.294]  So, just dumped some rocket fuel on it and woke up my brain and said, alright, I woke up, I'm 45, I got 5 kids and I've been pushed, you know, I've been dumped on for too long.
[02:37:45.294 --> 02:37:51.418]  And, uh, you know, one of my favorite poets is Eminem, one of the smartest cats alive.
[02:37:51.418 --> 02:37:54.840]  He actually inspired me, you know, inspired me to stay violent.
[02:37:55.250 --> 02:37:57.532]  He actually put out a 9-11 truth video.
[02:37:57.532 --> 02:37:58.993]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:37:58.993 --> 02:38:00.394]  Now it's five years ago.
[02:38:00.394 --> 02:38:02.555]  I mean, he's certainly tuned into reality.
[02:38:02.555 --> 02:38:03.756]  You ought to reach out to him, Charlie.
[02:38:03.756 --> 02:38:05.577]  You could probably, you know, actually get a hold of him.
[02:38:05.577 --> 02:38:07.018]  I'll reach out to him right now.
[02:38:07.018 --> 02:38:12.322]  Em, let's hook up and just bring fiery death.
[02:38:12.322 --> 02:38:16.085]  And you mean fiery death to lies and propaganda and hypocrisy?
[02:38:16.502 --> 02:38:18.983]  Yeah, but see, look at how they've gotten into your brain, dude.
[02:38:18.983 --> 02:38:20.883]  It's like now we have to, like, qualify everything.
[02:38:20.883 --> 02:38:21.244]  I don't know.
[02:38:21.244 --> 02:38:22.204]  Fiery death, man.
[02:38:22.204 --> 02:38:23.864]  You don't let them figure it out.
[02:38:23.864 --> 02:38:31.487]  No, I totally... If it comes from the sky or from my heart, then it's gonna have the same level of destruction.
[02:38:31.487 --> 02:38:32.928]  Charlie Sheen on fire.
[02:38:32.928 --> 02:38:34.648]  Charlie Sheen unloosed.
[02:38:34.648 --> 02:38:39.970]  You're hearing the real Charlie Sheen here on air right now.
[02:38:39.970 --> 02:38:41.971]  And my phone... Let me ask you this.
[02:38:41.971 --> 02:38:45.872]  Who have you ever referred to in the past as a tarot card?
[02:38:47.008 --> 02:38:47.828]  You.
[02:38:47.828 --> 02:38:48.548]  Thank you.
[02:38:48.548 --> 02:38:49.208]  I'll take it.
[02:38:49.208 --> 02:38:51.289]  I'm worth it.
[02:38:51.289 --> 02:39:03.591]  Well, what I meant by that is you have always been a giant, you know, top of the cream Hollywood star for many years now, the number one TV show, most rated, most money.
[02:39:03.591 --> 02:39:10.472]  But but now, because the media has continued to to to try to say you're going to be destroyed.
[02:39:10.472 --> 02:39:13.693]  Now there's this image that you're bulletproof and invincible.
[02:39:13.693 --> 02:39:14.633]  And, you know, I'd say don't
[02:39:14.833 --> 02:39:16.194]  I'm terribly flattered.
[02:39:16.194 --> 02:39:16.954]  Keep going.
[02:39:16.954 --> 02:39:17.415]  Keep going.
[02:39:17.415 --> 02:39:18.736]  Keep talking about me like this.
[02:39:18.736 --> 02:39:19.456]  People need to hear this, man.
[02:39:37.182 --> 02:40:02.344]  Man, I tell you, Charlie, I was always amazed by your knowledge of history and interesting things, but you were so tightly wound and focused and quiet all the times I hung out with you, and then you kind of went into this wild period and you've just come out of it just... I was shackled and oppressed by the deplorable, as I said,
[02:40:06.013 --> 02:40:07.095]  We're good to go.
[02:40:14.465 --> 02:40:16.227]  Let me bring up one more point on that subject.
[02:40:16.227 --> 02:40:18.128]  You talk about it being a cult.
[02:40:18.128 --> 02:40:23.153]  I'm not, I don't know enough about AA, never been to a meeting, but I have read their book.
[02:40:23.153 --> 02:40:30.219]  And I've talked to a lot of people that have been involved and they do describe it as a cult, saying be part of the group, don't be an individual.
[02:40:30.219 --> 02:40:31.540]  That's why I mentioned Thomas Jefferson.
[02:40:31.540 --> 02:40:32.862]  He was the opposite of that.
[02:40:32.862 --> 02:40:40.749]  And so it does have some of those hallmarks, but also you've, I mean, are you saying basically it's something kind of like Scientology, but different?
[02:40:41.673 --> 02:40:47.736]  I don't know enough about what I call the Church of the Martian Idiot to comment on.
[02:40:47.736 --> 02:40:56.640]  I mean, what they profess to believe in is, I don't know, I always thought it was a really complicated, long joke with no good punchline.
[02:40:56.640 --> 02:41:05.124]  But yeah, no, I just, 22 years around those oppressive clowns and losers, I just, you know, finally extracted myself.
[02:41:06.081 --> 02:41:10.207]  From their troll hole, and started living my life the way I want to live it.
[02:41:10.207 --> 02:41:14.372]  Because AA does not teach you how to live your life the way you want to live it.
[02:41:14.372 --> 02:41:16.816]  It's vintage, it's outdated, it's stupid.
[02:41:16.816 --> 02:41:19.860]  And it's worshipped by stupid people.
[02:41:21.272 --> 02:41:22.753]  And it is their fault, goddammit.
[02:41:22.753 --> 02:41:25.113]  It's like, oh, you can't blame people for, you know, being dumb.
[02:41:25.113 --> 02:41:27.594]  It's like they're as dumb as what they've been taught.
[02:41:27.594 --> 02:41:28.355]  No.
[02:41:28.355 --> 02:41:29.375]  Bullshit.
[02:41:29.375 --> 02:41:29.835]  Sorry.
[02:41:29.835 --> 02:41:30.595]  Step up.
[02:41:30.595 --> 02:41:31.396]  Step up and change it.
[02:41:31.396 --> 02:41:32.916]  Change it right now.
[02:41:32.916 --> 02:41:35.017]  Look your father in the eye and say, you're wrong.
[02:41:35.017 --> 02:41:35.637]  I'm different.
[02:41:35.637 --> 02:41:36.377]  I'm better.
[02:41:36.377 --> 02:41:36.918]  Watch me.
[02:41:36.918 --> 02:41:39.378]  Watch me bury you.
[02:41:39.378 --> 02:41:42.820]  And, Charlie, you will be back at work Tuesday.
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:45.080]  I'll be early.
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:45.761]  I don't sleep.
[02:41:45.761 --> 02:41:45.961]  I wait.
[02:41:48.303 --> 02:41:49.164]  I know you don't sleep.
[02:41:49.164 --> 02:41:52.125]  Sometimes I get texts from you at 3 a.m.
[02:41:52.125 --> 02:41:53.126]  your time.
[02:41:53.126 --> 02:41:55.548]  You are certainly on fire, my friend.
[02:41:55.548 --> 02:42:01.531]  Well, I think you have basically taken over the news cycle for the next week here on this broadcast.
[02:42:01.531 --> 02:42:02.452]  Great, great.
[02:42:02.452 --> 02:42:04.353]  You know, let's talk about something exciting.
[02:42:04.353 --> 02:42:06.935]  Me, and all this other boring garbage crap, you know.
[02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:15.903]  Man, Charlie, but I mean, you're describing this, you're saying you've come out of a cult for 20 years and that's why you're on fire.
[02:42:15.903 --> 02:42:17.544]  They suffocated my soul.
[02:42:17.544 --> 02:42:19.304]  They hijacked my brain.
[02:42:19.304 --> 02:42:21.525]  They brainwashed my friends and my family.
[02:42:21.525 --> 02:42:23.226]  Now I hate them violently.
[02:42:23.226 --> 02:42:28.388]  And I will use every soldier in my army to defend myself against them because they will come at me.
[02:42:28.388 --> 02:42:32.510]  They will come at me with all of their doctors and their talking heads and all their other frickin' loser clowns.
[02:42:33.430 --> 02:42:38.614]  And shame on these outlets that give these people the time to speak about me.
[02:42:38.614 --> 02:42:39.714]  How dare they speak of me?
[02:42:39.714 --> 02:42:40.495]  We've never met.
[02:42:40.495 --> 02:42:41.275]  How dare they?
[02:42:41.275 --> 02:42:42.816]  That's another thing.
[02:42:42.816 --> 02:42:45.258]  Another one of my other credos.
[02:42:45.258 --> 02:42:46.959]  Everybody has a black belt and carries a gun.
[02:42:46.959 --> 02:42:47.779]  I don't mess with people.
[02:42:47.779 --> 02:42:52.722]  I don't get up in people's groves and tell them, you know, I must now impose my silly will on you.
[02:42:52.722 --> 02:42:55.304]  But, dude, we just met, and I just thought it was actually for a cigarette.
[02:42:55.304 --> 02:42:57.165]  I'm like, yes, but.
[02:42:57.165 --> 02:42:57.565]  But.
[02:42:57.565 --> 02:43:00.127]  And, you know, dude, everything after but is just dial tone.
[02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:02.270]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:05.493]  Oh, but believe me, Charlie, I am really hearing you today.
[02:43:05.493 --> 02:43:08.855]  Basically, you're telling the world, I'm an individual.
[02:43:08.855 --> 02:43:10.596]  I control my own destiny.
[02:43:10.596 --> 02:43:11.617]  Stop speaking for me.
[02:43:11.617 --> 02:43:19.001]  I mean, look, I get calls probably every week for six years from the Hollywood Reporter, ABC News.
[02:43:19.001 --> 02:43:22.343]  I mean, my phone's over here ringing off the hook with national media.
[02:43:22.343 --> 02:43:26.286]  And I called you this morning and said, I'm getting TMZ and other people calling me.
[02:43:26.286 --> 02:43:27.327]  I said, I don't want to comment.
[02:43:27.327 --> 02:43:28.667]  I just want to let you speak for yourself.
[02:43:28.667 --> 02:43:30.228]  You said, absolutely.
[02:43:30.228 --> 02:43:30.869]  Absolutely.
[02:43:31.109 --> 02:43:33.290]  See, I mean, I don't run around.
[02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:39.852]  The one time I went on TV to talk about when you first went public for 9-11 Truth, I called you and said, do you even want me to do this?
[02:43:39.852 --> 02:43:40.793]  I don't want to speak for you.
[02:43:40.793 --> 02:43:41.873]  Why don't you go on?
[02:43:41.873 --> 02:43:43.173]  You said, no, do it.
[02:43:43.173 --> 02:43:49.016]  But then all these other people you let into your life and they just give out all your personal information on and on and on.
[02:43:49.016 --> 02:43:49.636]  And it's wrong.
[02:43:49.636 --> 02:43:51.697]  Yeah, but they think it's personal.
[02:43:51.697 --> 02:43:52.817]  They think it's information.
[02:43:52.817 --> 02:43:53.417]  It's nothing.
[02:43:53.417 --> 02:43:54.738]  It's a smoke screen, dude.
[02:43:54.738 --> 02:43:55.278]  It's come on.
[02:43:55.278 --> 02:43:56.058]  They don't know me.
[02:43:56.058 --> 02:43:57.239]  They never will.
[02:43:57.239 --> 02:43:58.159]  They don't deserve to.
[02:43:59.375 --> 02:44:02.591]  You know, I'm rolling out magic, bro, and I must save it for my family.
[02:44:03.854 --> 02:44:10.997]  Well, Charlie Sheen, Indomitable, just off the charts interview here.
[02:44:10.997 --> 02:44:17.259]  Let's bring up your friend, somebody who has defeated JP Morgan.
[02:44:17.259 --> 02:44:22.841]  Of course, everybody knows Lenny Dykstra, and of course, he won the World Series Championship in 1986 with the Mets.
[02:44:22.841 --> 02:44:25.802]  I'm not going to go over his whole record, but he's one of the greats.
[02:44:25.802 --> 02:44:30.304]  He hit .400 in August.
[02:44:30.304 --> 02:44:31.364]  Charlie, you introduce him.
[02:44:31.364 --> 02:44:32.045]  Nails is here.
[02:44:32.045 --> 02:44:32.905]  Tell us about Nails.
[02:44:33.919 --> 02:44:37.340]  He's just, he's hardcore.
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:41.340]  And it's with a capital C. There's a movie called Hardcore with George C. Scott.
[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:43.701]  So you can be hardcore and just be George Scott.
[02:44:43.701 --> 02:44:50.562]  You can be hardcore and then, you know, you get a lowercase c. My man is an uppercase George C. Scott.
[02:44:50.562 --> 02:44:54.183]  Hardcore.
[02:44:54.183 --> 02:44:55.203]  Here he is.
[02:44:55.203 --> 02:44:57.603]  Nails, you've been sitting here for 20 minutes on hold.
[02:44:57.603 --> 02:44:59.144]  What do you think of what Charlie's saying?
[02:45:00.752 --> 02:45:04.413]  Actually, I don't want him to stop.
[02:45:04.413 --> 02:45:06.294]  I mean, and Charlie knows me.
[02:45:06.294 --> 02:45:08.435]  I don't really tell him what he wants to hear.
[02:45:08.435 --> 02:45:10.115]  I just tell him the truth.
[02:45:10.115 --> 02:45:12.896]  Which is why we love each other unconditionally and with violence.
[02:45:12.896 --> 02:45:14.697]  And you're one of the best dudes alive, bro.
[02:45:14.697 --> 02:45:15.437]  No, no, you are.
[02:45:15.437 --> 02:45:22.759]  I mean, look, the thing about me is a lot of people don't like me because I tell the truth.
[02:45:22.759 --> 02:45:28.341]  And right now, Charlie, when I stay in play with the guys on point, I mean,
[02:45:29.085 --> 02:45:32.828]  And when I say on point, I mean, it's almost like he's on a mission.
[02:45:32.828 --> 02:45:35.569]  Anybody in his way, they're going to get mowed down.
[02:45:35.569 --> 02:45:37.671]  And they don't like it the way it is.
[02:45:59.485 --> 02:46:08.609]  The way the man uses the English language is... The thing about you, Charlie, is people do not realize how brilliant you are.
[02:46:08.609 --> 02:46:11.630]  By the way... Oh, you're too kind, but you speak the truth.
[02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:14.551]  I'm not a guy that gets underneath, if you know what I mean.
[02:46:14.551 --> 02:46:15.792]  If you know what I mean.
[02:46:15.792 --> 02:46:17.852]  I got your bone, neither am I, and I think you know what I mean.
[02:46:17.852 --> 02:46:22.734]  But what I'm saying is, I like to be around people I can learn something from, okay?
[02:46:22.734 --> 02:46:25.856]  And if I can't learn something every day, then it's kind of a lost day.
[02:46:27.595 --> 02:46:28.775]  Very well said, my man.
[02:46:28.775 --> 02:46:29.996]  Very well said, Len.
[02:46:29.996 --> 02:46:33.016]  Very well said.
[02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:37.697]  Every day I'm with Charlie, he continues to set new marks.
[02:46:37.697 --> 02:46:41.918]  Meaning, I keep saying it's got to be three of you.
[02:46:41.918 --> 02:46:43.399]  There has to be.
[02:46:43.399 --> 02:46:44.039]  But there's not.
[02:46:44.039 --> 02:46:53.161]  There's one of them, and right now, again, I appreciate the kind words, and the one thing about me I can tell you
[02:46:54.051 --> 02:46:59.294]  You got me on your team, then you got to pick a bullet for you.
[02:46:59.294 --> 02:47:04.636]  And I will watch it bounce off as I finish my ham sandwich.
[02:47:04.636 --> 02:47:07.038]  Charlie, something we've talked about privately.
[02:47:07.038 --> 02:47:07.918]  Change the subject for a moment.
[02:47:07.918 --> 02:47:09.499]  I want to get nails take on this.
[02:47:09.499 --> 02:47:11.480]  The TSA isn't just in the airports now.
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.302]  You've got to fly to private jets to get away from them, sticking their hands down people's pants.
[02:47:15.822 --> 02:47:23.073]  Drudge Report has the headline from Gizmodo, TSA agents pat down nine-year-old boy after train trip.
[02:47:23.073 --> 02:47:26.398]  They've got telescreens in Walmart saying, watch your neighbors.
[02:47:26.398 --> 02:47:29.021]  I mean, is this not the Gestapo rollout in America?
[02:47:29.838 --> 02:47:31.841]  I mean, duh.
[02:47:31.841 --> 02:47:33.182]  Kind of right there on the open.
[02:47:33.182 --> 02:47:40.572]  Anybody that wants to ignore it deserves to have their privates followed by some clown who worked at Dora or Walmart seven minutes before that.
[02:47:40.572 --> 02:47:43.315]  And then it took them six minutes to get to the airport.
[02:47:43.315 --> 02:47:45.798]  Losers and clowns and trolls, all of them.
[02:47:45.798 --> 02:47:48.602]  Touch my children and I will eat your hands off your frickin' arms.
[02:47:49.394 --> 02:47:50.935]  Well, that's actually what Ron Paul said.
[02:47:50.935 --> 02:47:59.098]  He said, if America lets this happen and lets them train us to be slaves, this is like prisoner induction training, then we deserve what we get.
[02:47:59.098 --> 02:48:00.678]  And Jesse Ventura said that as well.
[02:48:00.678 --> 02:48:02.959]  It's kind of true, you know.
[02:48:02.959 --> 02:48:04.540]  People say, I can't be blamed for my ignorance.
[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:06.000]  Yeah, well, who else am I going to blame?
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.081]  Your stupid wife?
[02:48:07.081 --> 02:48:08.221]  Good God, go away.
[02:48:08.221 --> 02:48:10.522]  Go back to the frickin' troll hole where you came from, fool.
[02:48:12.717 --> 02:48:15.961]  Oh man, this is incredible, Charlie.
[02:48:15.961 --> 02:48:19.425]  You know, we're doing this interview here, and I just appreciate you doing it here.
[02:48:19.425 --> 02:48:26.274]  You're my friend, I care about you, and obviously this is going to bring a lot of attention to Infowars.com.
[02:48:26.274 --> 02:48:27.976]  No way, they're going to ignore this.
[02:48:27.976 --> 02:48:30.379]  Come on, it'll be as though it never even happened.
[02:48:31.607 --> 02:48:36.571]  Yeah, I'm actually scanning the news, Charlie.
[02:48:36.571 --> 02:48:38.172]  Are we going viral?
[02:48:38.172 --> 02:48:43.316]  I would call it, not supernova, about a trillion times bigger.
[02:48:43.316 --> 02:48:47.720]  It's as if the entire universe of media is exploding right now.
[02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:52.003]  Wow, well, you know, that's, uh, I'm just giving them what I guess they want.
[02:48:52.003 --> 02:48:53.484]  I just don't know if they can handle it.
[02:48:53.484 --> 02:48:54.405]  Pussies!
[02:48:54.405 --> 02:48:57.027]  The truth, the truth always works.
[02:48:57.027 --> 02:48:59.069]  It doesn't, and the truth is unchanging, Len.
[02:48:59.069 --> 02:49:00.170]  That's why you don't have to remember.
[02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:06.655]  You just live inside of it, and everybody just falls down like, like plastic bowling pins.
[02:49:06.655 --> 02:49:07.616]  I don't know.
[02:49:07.616 --> 02:49:08.997]  Bad analogy, but you know what I'm saying.
[02:49:11.014 --> 02:49:15.436]  Everybody's out there wearing a cardboard belt like begging, begging for something and they get nothing.
[02:49:15.436 --> 02:49:16.936]  That's all they deserve, man.
[02:49:16.936 --> 02:49:28.160]  Charlie, of the giant, of the giant pantheon of Hollywood stars and TV stars, why are you the one that the media obsesses on more than really anybody I've ever seen?
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:32.141]  I mean, I mean, it's like, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:49:32.141 --> 02:49:34.962]  I mean, it's just Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen.
[02:49:36.081 --> 02:49:37.041]  I don't know, man.
[02:49:37.041 --> 02:49:40.603]  I guess I'm just that goddamn bitchin' and interesting.
[02:49:40.603 --> 02:49:42.304]  They want what he has, man.
[02:49:42.304 --> 02:49:43.604]  They want what he has.
[02:49:43.604 --> 02:49:45.265]  And they can't process it, Len.
[02:49:45.265 --> 02:49:46.706]  They can't process it.
[02:49:46.706 --> 02:49:52.848]  So they're baffled and they must write their silly words and come at me from a place of opinion and judgment.
[02:49:52.848 --> 02:50:01.552]  That's why Brando says that, Willard, have you ever considered, you know, being free from the opinions of others, from the opinions of yourself?
[02:50:01.552 --> 02:50:03.653]  I think today is a perfect example of just that.
[02:50:05.535 --> 02:50:06.697]  Wow.
[02:50:06.697 --> 02:50:07.337]  I don't know.
[02:50:07.337 --> 02:50:08.178]  Why don't I do this?
[02:50:08.178 --> 02:50:09.980]  You're a broken down baseball player, man.
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:11.282]  That's deep.
[02:50:11.282 --> 02:50:12.343]  Thanks, bro.
[02:50:12.343 --> 02:50:14.686]  I mean, what's that expression?
[02:50:14.686 --> 02:50:16.528]  You did take a few in the head, but you're still pretty sharp.
[02:50:16.528 --> 02:50:18.330]  I mean, I got hit by a lot of pitches, but not that many.
[02:50:20.274 --> 02:50:21.374]  I love that, man.
[02:50:21.374 --> 02:50:22.675]  I love that.
[02:50:22.675 --> 02:50:27.378]  In fact, you guys started playing some long toss, bro, to get you ready for Major League Three, man.
[02:50:27.378 --> 02:50:35.983]  Started with Todd Zeal the other day, and he was actually pretty impressed, and then one of the Goddesses came out, and the reason my arm is sore today is because I hopped it up like two weeks sooner than I should.
[02:50:35.983 --> 02:50:37.364]  I told you that, dude.
[02:50:37.364 --> 02:50:42.487]  I know, I know, but do not put one of them in front of me with a baseball in my hand, because violent things will happen, you know?
[02:50:43.387 --> 02:50:44.508]  Yeah, we're gonna go to Charlie.
[02:50:44.508 --> 02:50:47.450]  We're gonna go to break and decide if you want to stay or go We're gonna come back with nails.
[02:50:47.450 --> 02:51:00.980]  We're gonna go into overdrive This is pretty pretty amazing radio ladies and gentlemen obviously as as you can see but You know the government kills a million Iraqis.
[02:51:00.980 --> 02:51:01.621]  They're the good guys.

[02:51:16.247 --> 02:51:18.668]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[02:51:24.770 --> 02:51:28.192]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.

[02:52:30.564 --> 02:52:31.805]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:52:31.805 --> 02:52:36.368]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:52:36.368 --> 02:52:42.172]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:52:42.172 --> 02:52:45.814]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:52:45.814 --> 02:52:48.536]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:54:23.277 --> 02:54:27.058]  Well, Charlie, I am just really glad that you are 100% clean.
[02:54:27.058 --> 02:54:36.301]  You're on fire, and again, people don't judge Rush Limbaugh for what he's done, and you're a lot better man than he on many fronts.
[02:54:36.301 --> 02:54:38.261]  But can I just say this, Alex?
[02:54:38.261 --> 02:54:44.663]  I've never met the man, therefore I have no personal experience of him, so I cannot speak of him.
[02:54:45.365 --> 02:54:45.885]  Absolutely.
[02:54:45.885 --> 02:54:52.048]  But the thing I was going to get to, during the break we were talking about two and a half men and what you've been told behind the scenes.
[02:54:52.048 --> 02:54:55.309]  And I do see some news reports, the rumors going on.
[02:54:55.309 --> 02:54:56.150]  You want to speak to that?
[02:54:57.165 --> 02:55:06.012]  Yeah, I was told if I, you know, if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, and so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not.
[02:55:06.012 --> 02:55:07.754]  What was the thing you just said, Nails?
[02:55:07.754 --> 02:55:09.936]  Yeah, they don't like money no more.
[02:55:09.936 --> 02:55:12.638]  They all of a sudden stop liking money.
[02:55:12.638 --> 02:55:13.739]  Come on, cancel the show.
[02:55:13.739 --> 02:55:16.641]  They're going to cancel the show and I'm going to be a ballerina dancer, man.
[02:55:16.641 --> 02:55:17.822]  No, no, no.
[02:55:17.822 --> 02:55:22.366]  Are they happy with the five billion they've already made off me, or do they think they can turn that into ten in a couple more seasons?
[02:55:22.366 --> 02:55:23.868]  I don't know, I'm just saying.
[02:55:23.868 --> 02:55:25.469]  You know, it's a runaway frickin' juggernaut.
[02:55:25.589 --> 02:55:27.411]  Well, let me tell you what they're saying, Charlie.
[02:55:27.411 --> 02:55:29.953]  And again, these are tabloid sites, which is probably not true.
[02:55:29.953 --> 02:55:32.575]  They're saying they're going to have the show without you.
[02:55:32.575 --> 02:55:35.978]  That's like having the sunrise without the sun.
[02:55:35.978 --> 02:55:38.220]  Yeah, watch your ratings, dudes.
[02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:40.281]  Watch your stupid ratings.
[02:55:40.281 --> 02:55:40.722]  Whatever.
[02:55:40.722 --> 02:55:42.483]  Do what you got to do, man.
[02:55:42.483 --> 02:55:45.866]  I'll go make movies with superstars and not work with idiots, you know?
[02:55:45.866 --> 02:55:47.207]  Who's giving that info?
[02:55:47.207 --> 02:55:49.349]  I guarantee it's no one from any of the shows.
[02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:50.790]  It's a bunch of bozos.
[02:55:50.790 --> 02:55:51.231]  No, it is.
[02:55:51.231 --> 02:55:52.752]  It's super bozo sites saying it.
[02:55:53.252 --> 02:56:07.961]  Speaking of, not a bozo, but a real stud was Brian Wilson when he came into the studio, had him come in to work with Charlie and talked to him about Charlie the Closer, he's a closer.
[02:56:07.961 --> 02:56:12.164]  They were both kind of game on.
[02:56:12.164 --> 02:56:14.405]  And I'll tell you what, man, this guy was a warrior.
[02:56:14.405 --> 02:56:17.927]  I think you and him hit it off, man.
[02:56:17.927 --> 02:56:19.388]  I think you learned a lot with that guy, huh?
[02:56:20.097 --> 02:56:21.418]  Yeah, and I hope it was mutual.
[02:56:21.418 --> 02:56:25.822]  I just know we were instantly, uh, instantly bonded and on the journey together.
[02:56:25.822 --> 02:56:30.066]  And, uh, there were rumors that he broke camp and this and that, but that's all crap.
[02:56:30.066 --> 02:56:42.198]  He just, he was, he was brought out to, uh, to put some fire back in wild things, fingertips and eyes, because he says, I have a, I have tiger blood and Adonis DNA, and I must make them weep as they watch it.
[02:56:42.478 --> 02:57:01.888]  Well, Charlie, just so people out there understand some of what you said, you're now training with top baseball players, and I know that in powerlifting, shot put, and also power sports, when you talk about rage training, anger training, that's what the beard talks about is, you know, like, hey, you just won the World Series, what do you think?
[02:57:01.888 --> 02:57:02.688]  I want to rage.
[02:57:02.688 --> 02:57:05.730]  You're talking about taking your passion and focusing it.
[02:57:05.730 --> 02:57:07.331]  That's what you mean by ninja training.
[02:57:08.231 --> 02:57:09.032]  Absolutely, man.
[02:57:09.032 --> 02:57:10.553]  I mean, they're going to read whatever they want.
[02:57:10.553 --> 02:57:11.434]  They always bookend.
[02:57:11.434 --> 02:57:21.544]  They give you their stupid, judgmental opinion about how you're supposed to feel about what you're about to read, and they finish it off with how you're supposed to feel about what you just read.
[02:57:21.544 --> 02:57:22.686]  So they come at me with a Q&A.
[02:57:22.686 --> 02:57:24.688]  I'm like, yeah, can we unload the bookends?
[02:57:24.688 --> 02:57:25.789]  Then I'll think about it, you know?
[02:57:26.474 --> 02:57:32.577]  But no, but this guy is, uh, well you saw him, Len, he's just, he's focused and gnarly as they come.
[02:57:32.577 --> 02:57:41.200]  He is, and by the way, the beard, you can't duplicate, you couldn't try to grow a beard like that, that alone would put the fear of God in me as a hitter.
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:44.862]  Meaning, you have to tell the other players, do not stare at the beard.
[02:57:45.802 --> 02:57:46.423]  No.
[02:57:46.423 --> 02:57:52.789]  And then the 98 mile an hour gasoline with the cut on it helps a little bit too.
[02:57:52.789 --> 02:57:53.690]  It's unhittable.
[02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:54.310]  It's unhittable.
[02:57:54.310 --> 02:58:01.237]  He made Ryan Howard, I'm sorry Ryan, you're the best left hand hitter in 50 years, but he made him look like an armless child when he back door slidered his ass into the World Fair.
[02:58:02.858 --> 02:58:03.879]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:03.879 --> 02:58:04.839]  Wow.
[02:58:04.839 --> 02:58:05.720]  Wow, he's exciting.
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:13.404]  He's brought a different level of excitement back to the sport like Wild Thing did back in 89 when this thing launched, you know?
[02:58:13.404 --> 02:58:14.644]  Yeah, the real Wild Thing.
[02:58:14.644 --> 02:58:18.046]  I mean, Mitch Williams, I guarantee you that.
[02:58:18.046 --> 02:58:19.787]  You have every right to say that, Len.
[02:58:19.787 --> 02:58:21.468]  I can't stand that guy, man.
[02:58:21.468 --> 02:58:22.328]  Gripping the ball.
[02:58:22.328 --> 02:58:23.109]  Come on, Mitch.
[02:58:23.109 --> 02:58:24.069]  Gripping the ball.
[02:58:24.069 --> 02:58:24.850]  Yeah, grip the ball.
[02:58:26.753 --> 02:58:28.173]  Now some inside baseball talk.
[02:58:28.173 --> 02:58:31.554]  Charlie, you've done an hour with us.
[02:58:31.554 --> 02:58:35.555]  Let me say bye to you during the break, or you can stay on hold and listen to Nails, or you can continue.
[02:58:35.555 --> 02:58:38.015]  We're going into fourth hour overdrive right now.
[02:58:38.015 --> 02:58:39.836]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:39.836 --> 02:58:47.137]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.137 --> 02:58:48.358]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.593 --> 02:58:55.176]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:55.176 --> 02:58:56.477]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:56.477 --> 02:59:00.880]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:06.825]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:06.825 --> 02:59:08.967]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:08.967 --> 02:59:11.649]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:11.989 --> 02:59:18.491]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:59:18.491 --> 02:59:20.691]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:59:20.691 --> 02:59:26.033]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:59:26.033 --> 02:59:31.315]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:59:31.315 --> 02:59:36.476]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:59:36.676 --> 02:59:39.877]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.

[02:59:42.878 --> 02:59:43.639]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:59:43.639 --> 02:59:44.079]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:44.079 --> 02:59:44.859]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:44.859 --> 02:59:47.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:16.650 --> 03:00:23.094]  Well, Charlie Sheen came on the show and he let out his rage, his anger.
[03:00:23.094 --> 03:00:25.595]  I know a lot of behind the scenes things.
[03:00:25.595 --> 03:00:30.358]  I hope they don't cancel two and a half men over the interview you just heard.
[03:00:30.358 --> 03:00:32.699]  But he has made them millions of dollars.
[03:00:32.699 --> 03:00:33.800]  He is completely clean.
[03:00:35.321 --> 03:00:50.112]  And, you know, when I visited with Charlie off and on the last six and a half years, and Nails has known him for more than 15, there were all these people around him, some nice, some whatever, just kind of you could tell he felt like a prisoner and just basically stayed in his house.
[03:00:50.112 --> 03:01:00.460]  So I think right now this is just the big flaming energy of him and him sick of people making things up about him and saying things that aren't true.
[03:01:01.101 --> 03:01:03.864]  You know, that's why he made all those jokes here on air.
[03:01:03.864 --> 03:01:14.854]  But obviously, we appreciate Charlie coming on the show, and I've actually prayed with Charlie on air, and I've asked listeners to pray for him to stay clean and really wake up.
[03:01:14.854 --> 03:01:18.237]  I don't know what effect that's had, but it looks like it's done something.
[03:01:18.237 --> 03:01:18.978]  And I also...
[03:01:20.319 --> 03:01:21.080]  Well, what it is, is Charlie is
[03:01:48.418 --> 03:01:49.959]  Charlie's loyal, okay?
[03:01:49.959 --> 03:01:53.743]  And Charlie, it's not his first rodeo, okay?
[03:01:53.743 --> 03:01:58.789]  He can read people pretty good, and then he has to because a lot of people want a piece of him.
[03:01:58.789 --> 03:02:07.478]  But the bottom line is, right now, I'm seeing Charlie as dead-on as I've seen him in focus, and he's on a mission, okay?
[03:02:08.659 --> 03:02:19.265]  Well that's why he told me he likes you and I so much is because he sees us as real, as genuine, and that he says we're attacking every day.
[03:02:34.605 --> 03:02:35.506]  I mean, you have to.
[03:02:35.506 --> 03:02:37.347]  If you're not attacking, you're on defense.
[03:02:37.347 --> 03:02:40.289]  If you're on defense, that means you're losing.
[03:02:40.289 --> 03:02:42.010]  So, or you're stalling.
[03:02:42.010 --> 03:02:49.816]  The bottom line is, I like to get out ahead of everybody and try to win before the game starts.
[03:02:49.816 --> 03:02:52.658]  And the bottom line is, right now,
[03:02:54.119 --> 03:03:03.626]  Charlie's put me in a position where I'm actually ready to make a big, big move in my life, and then I see Charlie, what he's done, and it's helped me, okay?
[03:03:03.626 --> 03:03:08.070]  Just like I've helped him, because, you know, like I said, there's respect there.
[03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:10.572]  Yeah, he's a great actor, okay?
[03:03:10.572 --> 03:03:12.613]  And he's one of the best.
[03:03:12.613 --> 03:03:13.574]  He's a brilliant person.
[03:03:14.054 --> 03:03:20.218]  But more than that, he's a good friend and he's actually genuine, okay?
[03:03:20.218 --> 03:03:25.642]  And to say he's giving would be an understatement of the year.
[03:03:25.642 --> 03:03:27.964]  Meaning that this guy is so...
[03:03:30.755 --> 03:03:31.836]  Unselfish.
[03:03:31.836 --> 03:03:39.443]  I mean, it's amazing how he can remember every person that's over there, and he says goodbye, and he shows them respect.
[03:03:39.443 --> 03:03:44.567]  So, look, the reason why Charlie's so hot right now is because Charlie's real, okay?
[03:03:44.567 --> 03:03:48.130]  Charlie's not hiding anything, and by the way, he's sober.
[03:03:48.130 --> 03:03:51.313]  When it's sober, he doesn't even have that word sober.
[03:03:51.313 --> 03:03:52.234]  He's living right.
[03:03:52.234 --> 03:03:52.874]  How about that?
[03:03:52.874 --> 03:03:53.575]  That's the way it is.
[03:03:53.922 --> 03:04:22.665]  Well he's certainly moving in the right direction in a big way and uh... it's a process and uh... all of us are in that process and you know he doesn't tell people about but it's come out in the news what he's given for aids patients, breast cancer I mean this guy has given king's ransoms and then doesn't want any attention most people, and I'm not bashing them, but Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, you know they parade around giving money and stuff and that's fine but I mean Charlie
[03:04:23.894 --> 03:04:27.079]  Yeah, and also, he also would say that he definitely puts people in the seats.
[03:04:40.918 --> 03:04:44.741]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?
[03:04:44.741 --> 03:04:45.562]  Have you been laid off?
[03:04:45.562 --> 03:04:47.183]  Or had your hours cut?
[03:04:47.183 --> 03:04:48.705]  Are balloon payments coming due?
[03:05:10.563 --> 03:05:14.386]  You need help from MortgageFraudExaminers.com.

[03:06:02.327 --> 03:06:06.351]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:06.351 --> 03:06:09.595]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.595 --> 03:06:14.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:20.787]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:06:20.787 --> 03:06:23.030]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:06:23.550 --> 03:06:23.870]  Tim Geithner?
[03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:24.350]  Bernanke?
[03:06:24.350 --> 03:06:24.731]  They're arsonists!
[03:06:24.731 --> 03:06:25.711]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:06:25.711 --> 03:06:27.832]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:42.458 --> 03:06:44.599]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:06:44.599 --> 03:06:49.742]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:07:04.451 --> 03:07:09.594]  Have you ever wondered if you could make your car run on 100% electric power for free?
[03:07:09.594 --> 03:07:10.954]  It is now possible!
[03:07:10.954 --> 03:07:16.717]  How about a simple device that is both a super efficient motor and a free energy generator at the same time?
[03:07:16.717 --> 03:07:21.800]  What if this could also be used to restore useless batteries and save you lots of money?
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:30.764]  Because our customers asked for it, we have organized a Renaissance Charge Conference Workshop on July 29th to July 31st at the beautiful Coeur d'Alene Resort in Idaho.

[03:07:51.528 --> 03:07:51.788]  That's 208-772-4514.
[03:08:02.628 --> 03:08:09.273]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.273 --> 03:08:13.917]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.917 --> 03:08:19.221]  Well, I noticed that within minutes of us getting Charlie Sheen on, that Drudge Report was already covering it.
[03:08:19.221 --> 03:08:20.462]  I want to say hi to Matt Drudge.
[03:08:23.174 --> 03:08:28.215]  Also, we've got Access Hollywood, TMZ, the phone's in there just ringing off the hook.
[03:08:28.215 --> 03:08:31.255]  I think the interview, folks, speaks for itself.
[03:08:31.255 --> 03:08:34.576]  I didn't know that he was going to be that unleashed.
[03:08:34.576 --> 03:08:36.796]  It was just incredible.
[03:08:36.796 --> 03:08:48.799]  I got a chance to meet Lenny Dykstra a few weeks ago, a week and a half ago, when I was flown out by Charlie, you know, to hang out and talk about the New World Order and talk about fluoride and vaccines and 9-11.
[03:08:51.894 --> 03:08:58.519]  I got to meet Lenny, hang out with him, watch Apocalypse Now with him, have dinner, and then it clicked.
[03:08:58.519 --> 03:09:06.966]  I go, well, I know who Lenny Dykstra is, and they all talked about how, you know, he had this empire he built, and then in a year's time, you know, a lot of it collapsed.
[03:09:06.966 --> 03:09:11.170]  And I went, wait a minute, and then I saw in the news that he was the guy that beat JP Morgan.
[03:09:11.170 --> 03:09:20.558]  And then you saw more and more people in the last year beat JP Morgan and others in court with these mortgages that are basically, the news has reported, set up to fail.
[03:09:21.654 --> 03:09:31.702]  And then I sat there for like three hours with Lenny Dykstra, Nails, reading all the documents and all the things and the SCC probes and the things, and he beat him!
[03:09:31.702 --> 03:09:35.524]  And we're gonna have him back next week to get in that in great detail.
[03:09:35.524 --> 03:09:39.307]  But Nails, you wanted to continue talking about Charlie.
[03:09:39.307 --> 03:09:49.575]  I asked you what you thought of that unleashed, hardcore, it doesn't even say it, Charlie Sheen live interview that you were just a part of, but you had more to say about that.
[03:09:49.895 --> 03:10:02.039]  I mean, look, the bottom line is the last thing I am or anybody that knows me knows I'm not about as brown-nosing or trying to kiss up to somebody.
[03:10:02.039 --> 03:10:06.240]  But look, when a guy's on fire, he's on point, like Charlie is.
[03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:08.981]  You've got to give a man credit where credit's due.
[03:10:08.981 --> 03:10:10.322]  This guy's bounced back from
[03:10:12.052 --> 03:10:13.633]  Well, we all know what.
[03:10:13.633 --> 03:10:17.435]  But where he's at right now, he's on a different level.
[03:10:17.435 --> 03:10:21.978]  It's kind of like when they say you're seeing the ball good, that it's a hitter.
[03:10:21.978 --> 03:10:25.020]  Meaning, the ball looks like a basketball coming into him right now.
[03:10:25.020 --> 03:10:31.644]  And again, I'm saying that not because I'm trying to... I don't need to kiss up to anybody, okay?
[03:10:31.644 --> 03:10:33.085]  What I'm saying is the truth, okay?
[03:10:33.085 --> 03:10:36.287]  Because right now, I'm hanging out with Charlie on a mission.
[03:10:36.727 --> 03:10:37.809]  Well, also...
[03:10:53.268 --> 03:11:01.034]  And I understand why he doesn't do it, because if he responded to every lie, they'll just write more lies, so he will then respond to those, and they can get attention.
[03:11:01.034 --> 03:11:04.656]  But here's the mail, the Daily Mail Online, out of the UK.
[03:11:04.656 --> 03:11:10.380]  It says, now Charlie Sheen goes on vacation with porn star ex-wife Brooke Muller and nanny.
[03:11:10.380 --> 03:11:11.520]  There is no nanny.
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:12.601]  There are no children.
[03:11:12.601 --> 03:11:17.985]  And then I read the article while you're talking.
[03:11:17.985 --> 03:11:18.505]  I scan it.
[03:11:20.370 --> 03:11:22.292]  I'm not going to talk about what's really going on.
[03:11:22.292 --> 03:11:24.214]  I know everything that's going on.
[03:11:24.214 --> 03:11:26.617]  Because he doesn't want to be defended, I'm not even going to say it.
[03:11:26.617 --> 03:11:30.561]  But, basically, almost the entire article isn't right, isn't true.
[03:11:30.561 --> 03:11:33.964]  They just make stuff up about him.
[03:11:33.964 --> 03:11:35.927]  I mean, that's how it works, man.
[03:11:35.927 --> 03:11:38.930]  I mean, the truth in itself.
[03:11:38.930 --> 03:11:40.972]  Meaning, look, let me tell you something.
[03:11:41.613 --> 03:11:48.281]  I mean, right now I'm sitting in a friend's office right now, okay?
[03:11:48.281 --> 03:11:56.049]  And he's the president and CEO of a company called Olympia Financial, their headquartered in Encino.
[03:11:56.049 --> 03:12:00.534]  So anybody that wants the best money should put it here, because he's helping me get back on point.
[03:12:02.276 --> 03:12:02.856]  I think so.
[03:12:02.856 --> 03:12:03.116]  I think so.
[03:12:32.034 --> 03:12:32.976]  Absolutely.
[03:12:32.976 --> 03:12:33.397]  It's just...
[03:12:44.580 --> 03:12:49.442]  I see the media hold him up, in many cases, as the devil.
[03:12:49.442 --> 03:12:54.204]  But then meanwhile, all these Republican politicians are getting caught in bathrooms with men, and that's no big deal.
[03:12:54.204 --> 03:13:00.287]  They go to Bohemian Grove, they ship in homosexual porn stars to service them, and that's Christian of the Lord.
[03:13:00.287 --> 03:13:05.889]  And then you got a guy who's out in the open, and they just make up a bunch of lies about him, and that's what I was trying to say earlier.
[03:13:05.889 --> 03:13:11.572]  The government kills over a million Iraqis in the last eight years of occupation, and that's wholesome and good.
[03:13:12.572 --> 03:13:30.025]  There's a line in Apocalypse Now where Colonel Kurtz is talking and he says, we train our men to drop fire from planes on the enemy, but then we won't let them write dirty words on the sides of their airplanes because it's obscene.
[03:13:30.025 --> 03:13:31.786]  And it's like Charlie said, you're either hot
[03:13:32.927 --> 03:13:34.128]  Is it winning player, man?
[03:13:34.128 --> 03:13:40.913]  Look, in this world, me and Charlie, and I know you come from the same, you think the same way, you're a winning player or a losing player, and by the way,
[03:14:00.427 --> 03:14:03.489]  Winning rubs off on people, okay?
[03:14:03.489 --> 03:14:05.991]  And by the way, the people in the middle, we don't really care about.
[03:14:05.991 --> 03:14:08.112]  We just throw them back.
[03:14:08.112 --> 03:14:14.556]  But at the end of the day, it's all about this, what have you done for me lately?
[03:14:14.556 --> 03:14:16.837]  It's about you're as good as your last at that.
[03:14:16.837 --> 03:14:17.297]  Okay?
[03:14:17.297 --> 03:14:25.062]  Now, going back, what good does it do for me to go back and then tell everybody about how I got screwed out of this and they did this?
[03:14:25.542 --> 03:14:26.482]  Nobody cares.
[03:14:26.482 --> 03:14:28.783]  What they do care about is, what are you doing today?
[03:14:28.783 --> 03:14:30.143]  Okay?
[03:14:30.143 --> 03:14:31.903]  What are you going to do tomorrow?
[03:14:31.903 --> 03:14:34.804]  So, I live my life going forward, okay?
[03:14:34.804 --> 03:14:37.364]  And then, again, that's what Charlie's doing.
[03:14:37.364 --> 03:14:41.345]  Charlie right now is on a mission, okay?
[03:14:41.345 --> 03:14:42.826]  The same kind of mission I'm on.
[03:14:42.826 --> 03:14:47.066]  A little different paychecks coming in, okay?
[03:14:47.066 --> 03:14:49.367]  But we'll get back to that later.
[03:14:49.367 --> 03:14:49.847]  You know what I mean?
[03:14:50.427 --> 03:14:52.468]  Yeah, next week, because I have all the documents.
[03:14:52.468 --> 03:14:54.328]  You've beaten JP Morgan in court.
[03:14:54.328 --> 03:14:58.430]  You've had over 200, how many SEC probes and you beat them all?
[03:14:58.430 --> 03:15:00.530]  Well, the SEC investigated me for 10 months.
[03:15:00.530 --> 03:15:02.911]  I mean, I have a website.
[03:15:02.911 --> 03:15:05.012]  The only guy that was right about me was Jim Cramer.
[03:15:05.012 --> 03:15:05.772]  I mean, Jim Cramer,
[03:15:06.372 --> 03:15:10.634]  I mean, you know, I'm 205 and 0, okay?
[03:15:10.634 --> 03:15:13.575]  I can say that because that's what I am.
[03:15:13.575 --> 03:15:16.417]  If you say that and you're not 205 and 0, guess what?
[03:15:16.417 --> 03:15:18.858]  They put you in jail, okay?
[03:15:18.858 --> 03:15:20.238]  And they tried to do that to me.
[03:15:20.238 --> 03:15:22.039]  Ten months, they investigated me.
[03:15:22.039 --> 03:15:26.241]  Every paper they turned over, they said, there's no way you could do this.
[03:15:26.241 --> 03:15:28.002]  It's not about me doing it.
[03:15:28.002 --> 03:15:29.943]  It's about a model I built, okay?
[03:15:29.943 --> 03:15:30.283]  That's it.
[03:15:30.603 --> 03:15:31.644]  And that's why they came after you.
[03:15:31.644 --> 03:15:39.329]  I've talked to so many inside experts, some of the biggest brokers in the world before they retired, like Bob Chapman.
[03:15:39.329 --> 03:15:40.490]  And that's what he explained.
[03:15:40.490 --> 03:15:48.115]  For 11 years, insiders sent dossiers on Bernie Madoff stealing over $100 billion, and the SEC wouldn't go after him.
[03:15:48.115 --> 03:15:52.878]  But then small people, small companies, these systems are there to shut them down.
[03:15:54.739 --> 03:15:56.159]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[03:15:56.159 --> 03:16:03.961]  But I mean, it is important with MortgageGate now that all of this stuff's coming out and you're beating them in court and others are beating them in court.
[03:16:03.961 --> 03:16:09.362]  But notice now that you're winning in court over and over again, the media doesn't want to talk about Lenny Dykstra.
[03:16:09.362 --> 03:16:15.423]  They don't want to talk about nails because they don't want people to understand that it was almost all completely made up.
[03:16:15.423 --> 03:16:19.684]  But give us your mortgage website where you break down all the documents and show where this is happening.
[03:16:19.904 --> 03:16:22.586]  Yeah, I mean, look, here's the deal.
[03:16:22.586 --> 03:16:28.131]  I thought I was put on a thirst to entertain people on the baseball field, because I was actually pretty good at that.
[03:16:28.131 --> 03:16:36.839]  But when I went through the last two years, I realized there's a different plan for me, and that's to help people and to show them how they can save their homes.
[03:16:36.839 --> 03:16:41.383]  And so if people want to learn how to do that like I did, you go to home.
[03:16:42.382 --> 03:16:49.948]  And what this is, it's called predatory lending recovery.
[03:16:49.948 --> 03:16:52.990]  Again, I don't want to get too deep into this.
[03:16:52.990 --> 03:16:54.892]  But this is how you, you're beating them.
[03:16:54.892 --> 03:16:56.373]  I mean, you're showing that they set you up.
[03:16:56.373 --> 03:16:57.093]  I didn't beat them.
[03:16:57.093 --> 03:17:00.656]  I have an attorney in New York whose name is Moshe Mortner, okay?
[03:17:00.656 --> 03:17:02.738]  Because I represented myself, okay?
[03:17:02.738 --> 03:17:10.203]  Because those attorneys in those courtrooms over there, they want you to take a Xanax, get on your knees, put your hands behind your head, and say, okay, shoot me.
[03:17:11.384 --> 03:17:13.965]  No, I said, it don't work that way with me.
[03:17:13.965 --> 03:17:15.706]  I said, you're fired, you're fired, you're fired.
[03:17:15.706 --> 03:17:19.888]  I don't know how I'm representing myself because I'm not going down.
[03:17:19.888 --> 03:17:21.108]  I'm fighting, okay?
[03:17:21.108 --> 03:17:26.530]  And so the bottom line is, at the end of the day, I mean, look, I'm a normal guy.
[03:17:26.530 --> 03:17:28.431]  I don't believe in ghosts.
[03:17:28.431 --> 03:17:30.192]  I'm not afraid of the dark.
[03:17:30.192 --> 03:17:31.412]  Normal, okay?
[03:17:31.412 --> 03:17:33.894]  I didn't think there was such thing as corporate crime.
[03:17:33.894 --> 03:17:34.714]  Meaning, look,
[03:17:35.572 --> 03:17:42.361]  I think it's stupid overnight when you sit down with your broker, the guys that are loaning you the money, and you tell them you're bringing in $125,000 a month, okay?
[03:17:42.361 --> 03:17:45.806]  And you say, as long as we keep it right at $75,000 and I have $50,000 to play with, we're good!
[03:17:50.732 --> 03:18:05.676]  Okay, they say no problem and you show up things change next thing, you know, you're paying a hundred eighty thousand a month and and you're like Marcellus Wallace and Paul Fisher when his dad was taking it to him Not a good thing.
[03:18:05.676 --> 03:18:09.637]  Try paying 16 months in a row of a hundred eighty thousand dollars.
[03:18:09.637 --> 03:18:11.958]  Okay, and then so but
[03:18:14.939 --> 03:18:22.703]  No, but we need to talk about this because you've been winning and other people are now learning from you and others and all over the country the banks are getting beaten.
[03:18:22.703 --> 03:18:25.644]  It's turning out that they did want to set people up.
[03:18:25.644 --> 03:18:28.646]  They did want to basically do this and that's why I spent
[03:18:28.866 --> 03:18:44.232]  Many hours going over all the documents, the SEC stuff, all of it, and you were blown away when I met you at the house and you were showing me on the laptop that I was already aware of what the banks were doing because we were talking about this banker takeover operation with people, you know, 10 years ago.
[03:18:44.232 --> 03:18:48.734]  I mean, I've had former deputy heads of HUD on talking about how this was all a setup.
[03:18:48.734 --> 03:18:51.935]  I mean, this is, remember Timberwolf and Goldman Sachs.
[03:18:53.058 --> 03:18:59.080]  It came out that they were selling their customer stuff they knew that was going to fail while they were betting against it.
[03:18:59.080 --> 03:19:02.342]  I mean, look, you're so on point right there.
[03:19:02.342 --> 03:19:06.903]  I had no idea how crooked and how criminal what's going on.
[03:19:06.903 --> 03:19:11.665]  Look, these banks are destroying families, okay?
[03:19:11.665 --> 03:19:14.646]  This country is built on the American family.
[03:19:14.646 --> 03:19:18.768]  You have two million homes, two million homes in foreclosure right now.
[03:19:19.108 --> 03:19:20.209]  Right now.
[03:19:20.209 --> 03:19:20.829]  Okay?
[03:19:20.829 --> 03:19:23.330]  They're walking around with impending doom.
[03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:24.731]  They don't know what to do.
[03:19:24.731 --> 03:19:25.591]  They don't know where to go.
[03:19:25.591 --> 03:19:26.292]  They don't know what to do.
[03:19:26.292 --> 03:19:27.432]  You know what happens?
[03:19:27.432 --> 03:19:28.773]  A wife leaves a husband.
[03:19:28.773 --> 03:19:31.134]  The kids have to grow up without the parents.
[03:19:31.134 --> 03:19:34.876]  All because of these greedy banks putting them in a loan that they couldn't afford.
[03:19:34.876 --> 03:19:35.937]  Okay?
[03:19:35.937 --> 03:19:39.779]  So what we do is we... I'll tell you what, stay there Lenny.
[03:19:39.779 --> 03:19:40.379]  We gotta go to break.
[03:19:40.379 --> 03:19:42.360]  Let's come back into one more segment the next week.
[03:19:42.360 --> 03:19:43.520]  I'll get all the documents in front of me.
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:44.081]  We'll go over.
[03:19:44.961 --> 03:19:51.691]  A, how they've been scamming people, and how folks like yourself are starting to beat them in court, and of course that's caused MortgageGate now.
[03:19:51.691 --> 03:19:55.838]  We get laughed at five, six years ago talking about this because, you know, we understand what's happening.
[03:19:55.838 --> 03:19:57.680]  Now it's mainstream news.
[03:19:57.680 --> 03:19:58.221]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.216 --> 03:20:03.977]  Hello folks, this is Steve Schenck.
[03:20:03.977 --> 03:20:07.340]  This week we introduced a new product from eFoods Direct.
[03:20:07.340 --> 03:20:08.621]  Corn Chowder.
[03:20:08.621 --> 03:20:12.424]  And let me tell you, it's homemade flavor is absolutely amazing.
[03:20:12.424 --> 03:20:16.186]  You know eFoods, we've brought you the best food on the planet for years.
[03:20:16.186 --> 03:20:20.650]  As you know, we pioneered a line of quick fix meals that are super easy to fix.
[03:20:20.650 --> 03:20:22.611]  Obviously, winter is upon us.
[03:20:22.611 --> 03:20:26.374]  You can save 20% on the wonderful soup and bakery special.
[03:20:26.434 --> 03:20:27.015]  I think so.
[03:20:46.715 --> 03:20:48.096]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[03:20:48.096 --> 03:20:55.340]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[03:20:55.340 --> 03:20:58.141]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[03:21:13.490 --> 03:21:17.553]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[03:21:17.553 --> 03:21:22.316]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[03:21:22.316 --> 03:21:28.540]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[03:21:28.540 --> 03:21:30.241]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[03:21:30.241 --> 03:21:37.506]  Gold and silver will protect your assets and your purchasing power, physical possession of precious metals, IRA rollover, etc.
[03:21:37.506 --> 03:21:39.667]  Call me, Roger Rao, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 178.
[03:21:43.550 --> 03:21:47.932]  Take action today when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[03:21:47.932 --> 03:21:49.192]  Ready for a change?
[03:21:49.192 --> 03:21:51.473]  Call Roger Raw at 1-800-686-2237 extension 178.
[03:21:51.473 --> 03:21:52.753]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237 extension 178.
[03:22:01.033 --> 03:22:02.214]  A very wealthy U.S.
[03:22:02.214 --> 03:22:09.198]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:22:09.198 --> 03:22:11.760]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:17.163]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:22:17.163 --> 03:22:20.125]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:22:20.125 --> 03:22:22.186]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:22:22.426 --> 03:22:28.730]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:22:28.730 --> 03:22:32.112]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:22:32.112 --> 03:22:37.935]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[03:22:37.935 --> 03:22:39.576]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[03:22:39.576 --> 03:22:40.897]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:22:40.897 --> 03:22:43.578]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:22:43.578 --> 03:22:44.999]  He explains everything you need to know.
[03:22:45.259 --> 03:22:47.801]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[03:22:47.801 --> 03:22:52.366]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[03:22:52.366 --> 03:22:54.968]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[03:22:54.968 --> 03:22:58.731]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[03:22:58.731 --> 03:23:00.473]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[03:23:00.473 --> 03:23:03.616]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:23:03.976 --> 03:23:14.762]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:23:14.762 --> 03:23:23.927]  He believes people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition.
[03:23:24.347 --> 03:23:27.589]  Not by toxic prescription drugs, leading to side effects.
[03:23:27.589 --> 03:23:29.570]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[03:23:29.570 --> 03:23:39.136]  The good news is, Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[03:23:39.136 --> 03:23:46.420]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare, and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:47.140]  We're good.
[03:24:07.148 --> 03:24:08.609]  Well, Lenny Dykstra is our guest.
[03:24:08.609 --> 03:24:10.790]  Next week, we're going to go through mortgage fraud.
[03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:18.094]  We've had many other guests, as you know, over the years break this down, but he's a victim of it, but a person who fought back and is now winning, winning, winning, winning.
[03:24:18.094 --> 03:24:25.838]  And it's been in a few newspapers, but it should be a bigger news story that this is how they destroy people and because they're destroying a lot of other people.
[03:24:25.838 --> 03:24:32.101]  But folks can find out the whole history of it and how he's discovered ways to be victorious.
[03:24:32.101 --> 03:24:33.842]  Give that website out one more time, Lenny.
[03:24:34.042 --> 03:24:47.168]  Yeah, the website's home, uh, with a hyphen, uh, free, hyphen, uh, uh, systems, plural, dot com, and what that, what that's about is me hanging everything out there.
[03:24:47.168 --> 03:25:00.815]  I hang out my, I show everybody my forensic audit, and I show all the, all the set-off claims I'm allowed because of the, the violations that they, you know, they have to qualify you for a loan, meaning a DTI, I don't want to get too, you know,
[03:25:01.535 --> 03:25:03.916]  Well, we're going to cover it, Nails, next week for the full hour.
[03:25:03.916 --> 03:25:04.836]  Finishing up with Charlie.
[03:25:29.020 --> 03:25:37.146]  He, and I know he's listening right now, there in the Bahamas, that's no secret, it's all over the news where he's at, coming back next week for the show.
[03:25:37.146 --> 03:25:41.389]  I didn't know though that they were threatening him not to do interviews.
[03:25:41.389 --> 03:25:55.499]  Wow, he really is unleashed, and we again need to support Charlie, but he's got such an army of fans that even if they tried to cancel the show, he could instantly come back with another show and have even more viewers.
[03:25:55.979 --> 03:25:57.921]  Oh, I mean, couldn't you tell how scared he was?
[03:25:57.921 --> 03:26:00.203]  I mean, couldn't you tell how frightened he was?
[03:26:00.203 --> 03:26:00.764]  Come on!
[03:26:00.764 --> 03:26:08.491]  Charlie... Yeah, well he doesn't like being threatened and he's done being threatened and that's clear and he's throwing it all on the table and you gotta admire that, folks.
[03:26:08.491 --> 03:26:12.095]  You can say whatever you want about him, you have a right to kill him, but not to judge him.
[03:26:12.095 --> 03:26:19.162]  Absolutely, and not only that, I mean, you pop up the Charlie Sheen Show and, I mean, that thing is going to pollute him.
[03:26:19.162 --> 03:26:19.922]  You know what's funny?
[03:26:21.263 --> 03:26:31.387]  The first day I was there, before you got there the next day, and then we hung out, you know, for almost a day, Nails, I was out there going, Charlie, you sit around, you talk, you tell Hollywood stories.
[03:26:31.387 --> 03:26:35.428]  I mean, you're ten times more powerful in person than what they have you read as an actor.
[03:26:35.428 --> 03:26:40.950]  I said, dude, if they put you on Larry King's show, it could be from, or that new British guy with no ratings.
[03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:42.070]  Absolutely.
[03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.871]  And you know why?
[03:26:42.871 --> 03:26:46.493]  Because it's real, and the thing about it is, Charlie's a genius, okay?
[03:26:46.493 --> 03:26:47.053]  Meaning, look,
[03:27:08.377 --> 03:27:15.221]  Look, you don't get to where you're at, where he's at, because he's not a genius.
[03:27:15.221 --> 03:27:16.662]  He's a genius, okay?
[03:27:16.662 --> 03:27:17.382]  And he's brilliant.
[03:27:17.382 --> 03:27:20.844]  And the bottom line is, he's now letting everybody know that, okay?
[03:27:20.844 --> 03:27:23.666]  Instead of, like, defending things, he doesn't care.
[03:27:23.666 --> 03:27:24.867]  You know what he cares about?
[03:27:24.867 --> 03:27:27.748]  He cares about the people in his life, okay?
[03:27:27.748 --> 03:27:29.369]  And that's the way you have to live, because you know what?
[03:27:29.369 --> 03:27:32.611]  They're going to keep talking trash and keep saying bad things about you.
[03:27:32.611 --> 03:27:34.492]  So he's just done with it, man.
[03:27:34.492 --> 03:27:35.013]  He's done.
[03:27:35.013 --> 03:27:37.214]  He's going forward with or without them.
[03:27:38.934 --> 03:27:39.614]  Absolutely.
[03:27:39.614 --> 03:27:46.978]  Well, I'm just so glad that he's staying clean, but that he doesn't even like that moralizing.
[03:27:46.978 --> 03:27:51.200]  You know, that's why he says, yes, I am, you know, forever, but not if I don't want it.
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:53.021]  You know, the way it is, he's living right.
[03:27:53.021 --> 03:27:54.081]  OK, he's living right.
[03:27:54.081 --> 03:27:55.942]  He's living the way he's living right.
[03:27:55.942 --> 03:27:56.722]  OK.
[03:27:56.722 --> 03:28:00.044]  And by the way, living right for him is
[03:28:01.394 --> 03:28:02.155]  I don't think so.
[03:28:22.737 --> 03:28:25.098]  That show will be the most popular show on TV again.
[03:28:25.098 --> 03:28:25.418]  Why?
[03:28:25.418 --> 03:28:27.499]  Because he's got talent.
[03:28:27.499 --> 03:28:28.339]  Wait a minute.
[03:28:28.339 --> 03:28:33.121]  Even his rebroadcast Monday of an old show beat everything else on TV.
[03:28:33.121 --> 03:28:34.942]  Period.
[03:28:34.942 --> 03:28:37.202]  Period is the right, right is the right.
[03:28:37.202 --> 03:28:39.963]  I think that's what some of you are saying.
[03:28:39.963 --> 03:28:42.024]  Hey, they should be happy he's being real.
[03:28:42.024 --> 03:28:48.367]  But, but, I mean, they're going to have even higher ratings on Monday with the next rebroadcast of an old show while they start shooting new ones.
[03:28:48.367 --> 03:28:49.447]  And here's the issue.
[03:28:49.447 --> 03:28:51.568]  I've talked to a lot of high-powered Hollywood people.
[03:28:52.428 --> 03:28:55.050]  I mean, some of the biggest, and they're all imprisoned.
[03:28:55.050 --> 03:29:02.374]  I mean, I can't even tell folks who we talked to, you know, when I was there at his house and stuff, but they all know about the New World Order.
[03:29:02.374 --> 03:29:03.695]  They all know about the globalists.
[03:29:03.695 --> 03:29:09.739]  They're all into, quote, conspiracies, but they have to stay in this left-right paradigm or the system tries to destroy them.
[03:29:09.739 --> 03:29:19.125]  But if more of the Hollywood stars and people, and this is used to control culture, would just come out and start being themselves, because I'm telling you, the culture is anti-New World Order.
[03:29:19.125 --> 03:29:20.786]  It is pro-liberty.
[03:29:21.406 --> 03:29:22.887]  The globalists will lose control.
[03:29:22.887 --> 03:29:28.549]  This is not just a revolution through the corporate news and politics.
[03:29:28.549 --> 03:29:31.951]  The globalists have used Hollywood to distract people from reality.
[03:29:31.951 --> 03:29:35.412]  This information can break people out.
[03:29:35.412 --> 03:29:38.293]  It's a rebellion from within their mind control system.
[03:29:38.293 --> 03:29:40.174]  And we salute Charlie for being so real.
[03:29:40.174 --> 03:29:41.135]  You too, Nails.
[03:29:41.135 --> 03:29:43.756]  I'll say bye to you during the break, but you're back on next week.
[03:29:43.756 --> 03:29:45.617]  In fact, we're going to figure out the time right now.
[03:29:45.617 --> 03:29:47.678]  We're coming back with what's happening in Libya.
[03:29:47.678 --> 03:29:48.178]  Stay with us.
