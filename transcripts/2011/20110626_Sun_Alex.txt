[00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.342]  You've got it.
[00:00:02.462 --> 00:00:08.206]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:10.388]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.134]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:21.496]  You've got it.
[00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:41.753]  The spoken word is a extremely powerful mode of communication between humans.
[00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:46.194]  One of the oldest forms of communications, obviously.
[00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:57.117]  Other than hormonal, pheromone, sense, or primitive grunts and body language, it is
[00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:03.494]  Probably the most essential form of communication and one of the big things that makes us human.
[00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:15.078]  But at the same time, speech cannot move at the speed of thought and connections and understandings.
[00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:27.123]  That's why when you attempt to instruct your children, many times they won't listen to you until they experience the bad thing that you've been warning them about.
[00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:35.091]  And it's the same thing with adults, it's the same thing with countries, with civilizations, with different races of man.
[00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:48.541]  And the more you learn about history, the more you learn about humanity, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the great heights, the incredible lows, the more the universe opens up to you.
[00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.905]  And that's really what's frustrating, is that I don't see myself as particularly intelligent.
[00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:55.306]  I'm not on a power trip.
[00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:56.707]  I'm not arrogant.
[00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:22.078]  And then I see people who have very little knowledge, and who almost attack knowledge, and think that it's a feat or something, that they believe they've got it all figured out, they don't even understand the basics of life on this planet, the basics of history, the basics of human activity, liberty, and the eternal struggle against tyranny.
[00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.024]  But it really hit me this weekend.
[00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:34.353]  And I experienced something akin to the 100th monkey syndrome.
[00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:56.184]  That, of course, was studies done where they found that monkey populations, if they could be trained on one island, an island 10 miles away, that as soon as a certain percentage of the monkeys were taught a new trick, it was almost like there was some spiritual broadcasting system in the sixth sense realm that studies do show is there.
[00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:57.904]  And the monkeys at the
[00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:10.272]  Nearby Island would suddenly have a critical mass and start manifesting the activity that had to be taught to the other group of monkeys, but of the same species.
[00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:21.059]  And I think it's more simplified in modern technological terms, just that things have a buzz.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.221]  Certain issues become hot.
[00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.004]  Certain issues ebb in their popularity.
[00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:36.322]  And that the system has said many times, there's no guessing the public's taste.
[00:03:36.422 --> 00:03:37.563]  There's no understanding it.
[00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:41.065]  And that's really what the NSA is all about.
[00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:55.114]  And InfoPoll9 in Europe for decades has been calling your conversations, your phone calls, your purchases to really decide what you're into and really get your psychological number.
[00:03:56.064 --> 00:04:03.306]  Your profile, so they can then manipulate that profile and change that profile with the propaganda and programming they pump in.
[00:04:04.486 --> 00:04:20.510]  But also to see trends as they're developing in their embryonic phase in a viral stage growing, so that trends the system doesn't like can be blocked, or manipulated, or mutated, or co-opted.
[00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:22.151]  And
[00:04:23.715 --> 00:04:36.307]  There was a dinner party at my next door neighbor's and I was invited to it and there were microbiologists there and marine biologists and people and it was very interesting.
[00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:37.749]  They didn't know who I was.
[00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.956]  They were all telling me about the, some of them were medical people, doctors, they were telling me about
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.761]  Basically, the global extermination plan.
[00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.122]  I was like, really?
[00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:51.283]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:51.303 --> 00:04:51.783]  Stay with us.
[00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:53.305]  Big show today.
[00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.626]  You know, power-packed with key information.
[00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:57.888]  The human revolution of liberty continues.
[00:05:04.076 --> 00:05:05.037]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:08.921]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:11.484]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.504 --> 00:05:16.950]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.617]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.037 --> 00:05:29.561]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:33.664]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.184 --> 00:05:38.227]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:43.991]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:47.394]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:49.375]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:50.396]  It's here.

[00:06:06.372 --> 00:06:08.675]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:18.573]  Yeah.
[00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.675]  Thank you so much for joining us today, my friends.
[00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:38.679]  It is the 26th day of June, 2011, on this live Sunday edition.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:49.786]  And we're here every Sunday, broadcasting on AM, FM, Global Shortwave Satellite, Internet at Infowars.com, 4 to 6 p.m., back Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:50.347]  to 2 p.m.
[00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:50.707]  Central.
[00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:52.288]  Okay, let me do this.
[00:06:53.715 --> 00:07:08.829]  Let me just run over some of the headlines that we're going to be breaking down and giving you the news behind the news, the story behind the story, the rest of the story as Paul Harvey famously said, and then I'm going to get into our two top stories today.
[00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:13.973]  And one of those, of course, well, there's really three top stories.
[00:07:13.993 --> 00:07:18.037]  In fact, all these stories are pretty darn important, the more I think about it.
[00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:27.428]  What really happened Friday with the House saying, we're not going to authorize the Libyan war, but we're going to give you the funding for the Libyan war?
[00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.712]  It's another political stunt.
[00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:34.123]  And Ron Paul has broken that down.
[00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:35.224]  We're going to be breaking it down.
[00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:37.106]  And what does this signify?
[00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:40.029]  And where is this constitutional crisis going?
[00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.275]  In the words of Congressman Nadler and others, the president, for all intents and purposes, is now an emperor.
[00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:52.340]  And the bureaucracy around him and future presidents
[00:07:53.308 --> 00:08:09.037]  Democrats were horrified by Bush's imperial activities, but now that it's their guy in, they love it, and Republicans are horrified now by Obama's imperialist activity, emperor-like activity, and then once Republicans get back in, they'll suddenly love it.
[00:08:09.497 --> 00:08:16.081]  What is it about people that as long as they think their political team is winning, they don't care if the Bill of Rights and Constitution is butchered?
[00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:21.724]  Even though all of us are losing in the end, as long as they feel like they're winning,
[00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:23.556]  Then it's okay.
[00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:26.479]  I get emails all the time saying, you dirty Republicans!
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.362]  You need to shut up about the TSA groping people.
[00:08:29.403 --> 00:08:30.804]  And I'm like, dirty Republicans?
[00:08:31.265 --> 00:08:35.349]  This is a nonpartisan, across-the-board issue, outraging everyone.
[00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.171]  It's a federal power grab.
[00:08:37.632 --> 00:08:42.077]  It sets a precedent for goons to stick their hands down your pants.
[00:08:42.978 --> 00:08:44.640]  We got Miss USA crying.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.142]  We've got old ladies having their diapers taken off.
[00:08:48.182 --> 00:08:50.985]  We've got people's colostomy bags being ripped off of their body.
[00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:54.988]  And you're sending me little sniveling emails about how I'm a dirty Republican?
[00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:56.550]  Why don't you live in reality?
[00:08:57.711 --> 00:08:58.992]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:00.073]  I'm a liberty lover.
[00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:03.756]  And I go after Republicans or Democrats when they attack that.
[00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:07.379]  And when they're for it and they do the right thing, I will talk about it.
[00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:09.034]  I'm about issues.
[00:09:09.094 --> 00:09:10.035]  I'm about reality.
[00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:13.156]  I'm about actual substance here.
[00:09:13.897 --> 00:09:14.537]  Substance.
[00:09:15.197 --> 00:09:21.900]  So we're going to get into the whole US House keeps Libya funding, fails to authorize mission.
[00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:29.924]  They now admit that the Patriot Act is being openly interpreted by the FBI to mean they don't need warrants for any activities against the American people.
[00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:32.805]  That's Time Magazine telling us how great it is.
[00:09:34.446 --> 00:09:35.106]  We've got also
[00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.635]  The big TSA developments and
[00:09:43.991 --> 00:10:11.084]  I'll be honest with you, a month ago when I got angry that the House had unanimously done the right thing and said that it would be a felony if the TSA touched your genitals on the outside or on the inside of your pants, because so many members of the House that had actually been groped or small children, they witnessed this concentration camp inductee training, this prisoner induction training, that's what it is, this federal power grab, Tenth Amendment killing induction.
[00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:15.408]  And so they got angry unanimously, 138 to zip.
[00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:20.552]  Then they had almost unanimous in the Senate, one vote against it, but they wouldn't let the vote come up.
[00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:21.793]  Dewhurst killed it.
[00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.794]  That was confirmed by Senator Patrick and others.
[00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:25.215]  Dewhurst got under heat.
[00:10:25.315 --> 00:10:26.296]  Perry got under heat.
[00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:33.761]  And so Perry waited until right to the end of the special session under huge national pressure, not just Texas pressure, to put it back on.
[00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:41.687]  And then the Speaker of the House Friday called it a political stunt, said the legislation was a joke, even though he voted for it a month ago.
[00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:43.609]  And never gave any evidence of it.
[00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:44.530]  I have the legislation.
[00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.913]  It says official oppression.
[00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:58.007]  The Attorney General said why don't you change it from molestation, though it could be, to official oppression because if a police officer grabs your genitals, unless it's an emergency situation or they have a warrant,
[00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:03.092]  They would be charged with a felony, so the TSA can't do it.
[00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:10.279]  And they said, okay, we changed the bill, and they said, oh, wait till Friday, it's okay, we'll vote on it.
[00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:16.045]  And then suddenly, the Senate didn't show up, the leader of the House came out and said, I'm not gonna let you vote on it.
[00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:30.498]  Which violates state's house rules, and we've had David Simpson on who authored the bill many times, and last night he put out a press release breaking down the fact that it does violate state ethics rules and house rules.
[00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:34.882]  So, and Simpson also said, why even have a state legislature?
[00:11:36.072 --> 00:11:37.633]  Why even have a state legislature?
[00:11:37.673 --> 00:11:39.814]  Why even have House members or Senate members?
[00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:45.937]  I mean, if it's only the governor, the lieutenant governor that runs the Senate, and the Speaker of the House, how about we just generally elect them?
[00:11:45.957 --> 00:11:49.239]  Or how about just make them royal families?
[00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:54.962]  Kind of like in North Korea, they're now three generations of communist dictator, now calling themselves royalty.
[00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:58.704]  That's how royalty started, sitting with Queen Elizabeth's family hundreds of years ago.
[00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:02.246]  They're just dictators that wear gold crowns and you bow down to them.
[00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:03.266]  I mean, why not?
[00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:03.987]  Why not?
[00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:11.729]  In fact, the feds are saying they were going to blockade Texas again, and threatening people, and that they were going to sue the state of Texas.
[00:12:12.729 --> 00:12:23.852]  And so, the Speaker of the House, Joe Straus, headline, House Speaker calls pat-down bill a stunt, and then never says why it's a stunt.
[00:12:25.732 --> 00:12:27.733]  Okay, so now it's a stunt, I guess.
[00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:37.426]  If members of the House of Representatives federally tell Obama you've got to get congressional authorizations for a new war, I mean that's just the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the law.
[00:12:40.287 --> 00:12:43.729]  Because a week ago, when members of the House sued, it was called a stunt.
[00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:49.012]  They have these political experts, these spin doctors, saying, stunt or hoax sounds good for the public.
[00:12:49.032 --> 00:12:50.352]  You don't have to give any facts.
[00:12:50.713 --> 00:12:58.036]  It's just a hoax at the House, in the federal Congress, saying, Obama, you've got to have authorization.
[00:12:58.577 --> 00:12:59.197]  It's a hoax.
[00:12:59.277 --> 00:12:59.957]  It's a stunt.
[00:13:00.398 --> 00:13:01.999]  It's the same thing they're now saying in Texas.
[00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.099]  It's a hoax.
[00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:04.640]  See, it's a playbook, folks.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.440]  It's totally sick.
[00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:06.621]  It's a hoax.
[00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:08.022]  It's a stunt.
[00:13:09.462 --> 00:13:11.403]  We're not going to give any reasons why we're saying that.
[00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:17.247]  We just hope you won't read the bill that the Texas Attorney General helped write.
[00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:19.569]  Nothing hoaxy about it.
[00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:23.151]  You can't go out and grab a woman's genitals or a man's genitals in a park.
[00:13:24.152 --> 00:13:25.673]  You get felony time for that.
[00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:27.294]  An FBI agent can't do it.
[00:13:27.334 --> 00:13:28.115]  A cop can't do it.
[00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:29.175]  A state trooper can't do it.
[00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:30.897]  A janitor, an auto mechanic.
[00:13:32.097 --> 00:13:32.718]  No one can do it.
[00:13:34.461 --> 00:13:40.543]  Doctors go to jail if they improperly touch women and they haven't gotten authorization first.
[00:13:41.043 --> 00:13:48.465]  But now in America, just the feds do what they want and they come out and call it a hoax.
[00:13:48.905 --> 00:13:51.386]  So that's one of the other big stories.
[00:13:51.506 --> 00:13:53.227]  And this is up on Drudge Report.
[00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:54.567]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:56.048]  It's also at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:56.568 --> 00:14:00.629]  And under this article, Drudge is linked to our report from Friday.
[00:14:02.372 --> 00:14:06.275]  Wow, and let me tell you, we've gotten about 2 million visitors from that one article on Drudge.
[00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:07.296]  There's nothing like it, folks.
[00:14:07.336 --> 00:14:11.219]  I can be on Nightline with my website plugged 10 times and no visitors compared to Drudge.
[00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:12.120]  Just amazing.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.102]  But there's a big report up at Drudge.
[00:14:15.162 --> 00:14:17.884]  Texas lawmakers AWOL for vote on TSA groping.
[00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:21.687]  So that's coming up later in the broadcast and we're working on getting Simpson on.
[00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:27.272]  If he's not on today, state rep, he'll be on tomorrow because the whole nation is watching this.
[00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:35.995]  But also up at Drudge, a News Herald reporting out of Panama City, Florida, elderly woman asked to remove adult diaper during TSA search.
[00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:43.418]  They held her for 45 minutes, forced her to get out of the wheelchair even though she was flying home to die with terminal leukemia.
[00:14:43.778 --> 00:14:45.678]  She begged them and of course said she couldn't get up.
[00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:46.719]  You can go read the whole article.
[00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:47.619]  I don't know.
[00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:20.670]  There's been many cases where they just rip the colostomy bags off, or the urology bags also, you've had to have your bladder removed.
[00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.691]  And then they say, what is this?
[00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.632]  And they say, it's my colostomy bag.
[00:15:24.672 --> 00:15:29.515]  And TSA just goes right in front of her body, and a spray of feces goes off across the floor.
[00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:31.137]  And they're like, why'd you do that?
[00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:33.298]  And they're like, you just ripped my colostomy bag off.
[00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:35.660]  Get over there and sit down!
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.862]  We gotta do this so Al-Qaeda don't get ya!
[00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:40.923]  Put the border wide open!
[00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:42.144]  But here's the story.
[00:15:42.244 --> 00:15:45.446]  Elderly woman asked to remove adult diaper during TSA search.
[00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:49.429]  And then of course the stress of her having to get up out of her wheelchair.
[00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.710]  And she says here she's going home to die.
[00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:56.834]  She's going home to family in Michigan from Florida to die and to be buried at the family cemetery.
[00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:57.874]  But hey!
[00:15:58.095 --> 00:15:59.335]  You're gonna pay Al-Qaeda!
[00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:03.681]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:16:03.901 --> 00:16:08.927]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:16:09.207 --> 00:16:10.589]  Saving means to make money.
[00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:19.559]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:27.365]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:35.410]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.733]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:17:00.725 --> 00:17:04.968]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:17:05.288 --> 00:17:05.549]  Number 1.
[00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:09.351]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.172]  Number 2.
[00:17:10.472 --> 00:17:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:15.376 --> 00:17:15.816]  It's true.
[00:17:16.116 --> 00:17:20.680]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.520]  Number 3.
[00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:25.103]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:25.403 --> 00:17:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:29.286 --> 00:17:29.847]  Number 4.
[00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:32.450]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.234]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:37.075]  Number 5.
[00:17:37.335 --> 00:17:41.239]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.245]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:46.505 --> 00:17:50.551]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:18:10.887 --> 00:18:14.972]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[00:18:15.353 --> 00:18:20.539]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:29.210]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:05.990]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:14.432]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:19:15.172 --> 00:19:19.213]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:30.615]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:40.257]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:40.777 --> 00:19:45.818]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:19:46.199 --> 00:19:53.360]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.441]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:20:02.017 --> 00:20:04.878]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:09.701]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:25.408]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:28.870]  Rallying patriots worldwide,
[00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:35.802]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:39.246 --> 00:20:44.333]  You know, I do have one correction to make, and as soon as I said it, I knew it wasn't reality-based.
[00:20:45.354 --> 00:20:49.880]  The TSA people look like, on average, the stereotype.
[00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:55.349]  The bespeckled, pot-bellied, pedophile type.
[00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.732]  You know, the pedophiles always look the same on the news.
[00:20:58.353 --> 00:21:05.581]  The little scraggly mustache, the pot-belly, the weird feet-eyes.
[00:21:06.802 --> 00:21:10.186]  And that, you gotta say, is the TSA typecast person.
[00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:15.909]  You know, some people look like they're tough guys in a uniform or whatever, like soldiers, that idea.
[00:21:16.989 --> 00:21:25.036]  And sure, they can look roided out and crazed and crazy, but it's different than the pedophile or control freak brigade.
[00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:40.408]  But regardless of that, the feds know they're creating an army, and this is being done in every other industrialized nation, of people who enjoy, A, having no common sense and standing beside radiation scanners all day that on record are going to kill them deader than a hammer.
[00:21:40.828 --> 00:21:41.689]  Yeah, but it won't matter.
[00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:42.589]  It'll be 20 years from now.
[00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:47.412]  The feds will just, you know, block funding for their health care like they've done for 9-11 emergency people.
[00:21:47.772 --> 00:21:48.692]  They'll tell them it's fine.
[00:21:49.033 --> 00:21:52.935]  You know, that brain tumor's healthy or the testicular cancer, that's good for you.
[00:21:53.335 --> 00:21:54.456]  You know, there's too many people anyways.
[00:21:54.476 --> 00:21:55.096]  It's for the earth.
[00:21:55.996 --> 00:22:00.099]  But also, enjoy freaking people out, yelling at folks, getting in their face.
[00:22:00.899 --> 00:22:06.522]  Everybody I talk to that flies, even people that were pro-establishment, you know, are freaked out by how they get yelled at.
[00:22:06.562 --> 00:22:07.562]  Put your feet there!
[00:22:07.662 --> 00:22:08.222]  Move here!
[00:22:08.282 --> 00:22:08.963]  Go over there!
[00:22:08.983 --> 00:22:10.804]  I didn't say you could leave the scanner!
[00:22:11.644 --> 00:22:15.586]  And it's all about breaking your will and training you to be a slave.
[00:22:16.454 --> 00:22:30.949]  But I wasn't joking about the stories, you can pull them up, of the urine bags, the colostomy bags, I hate to talk about this but this is happening, the diapers, and I see it, and you've seen the other reports where people
[00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.471]  Come there.
[00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:33.531]  It's on record.
[00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:34.712]  They even have medical cards.
[00:22:35.893 --> 00:22:37.273]  In some cases, they can't walk.
[00:22:37.694 --> 00:22:41.756]  And they will deny quadriplegics and people from getting on a plane.
[00:22:41.776 --> 00:22:47.599]  They say, sorry, you can't get up away from the wheelchair to make sure you don't have a bomb.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.081]  And they say that's the end of it.
[00:22:51.142 --> 00:22:53.845]  And a lot of times then they won't even let family help them get up.
[00:22:54.225 --> 00:22:57.168]  So you'll see an old person struggling, battling to get up.
[00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:04.997]  And that's what happened here with this 95-year-old woman who has terminal leukemia and is going home to be with her family to die, the report says.
[00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:07.980]  And they made her get up out of the wheelchair.
[00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:10.964]  And so she soiled herself, and that made them angry.
[00:23:11.424 --> 00:23:13.126]  So they took her back and strip-searched her.
[00:23:13.547 --> 00:23:17.311]  And they got more upset that they had a diaper full of, you know, cancer patients.
[00:23:18.853 --> 00:23:21.336]  I mean, what do you expect, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:23:22.337 --> 00:23:23.438]  And this just went on and on.
[00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:27.523]  And you can read her daughter, who was with her, who wasn't allowed to go in for the strip-search.
[00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:36.614]  If people started shoving me around and taking my mother behind closed doors, you're going to be dealing with the Incredible Hulk.
[00:23:37.274 --> 00:23:39.055]  And see, that's the problem, folks.
[00:23:39.815 --> 00:23:43.476]  They're setting up a system where they know you're going to resist and they're going to be called a terrorist.
[00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:47.818]  You understand, you were called terrorists in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
[00:23:47.838 --> 00:23:51.079]  If you didn't like Hitler, you were arrested as a subversive terrorist.
[00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:54.760]  And that's just, that's what's been set up here.
[00:23:55.714 --> 00:24:02.143]  Now, if you're Wachovia and Wells Fargo laundering $376 billion in narcotics money, you don't get in trouble.
[00:24:02.864 --> 00:24:08.573]  But if you are dying of cancer and going home to die, and you poop your pants, they're going to get angry.
[00:24:09.434 --> 00:24:10.395]  Even though they made you do it.
[00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:15.893]  But continuing here, but don't worry, they're keeping us safe from old ladies going home to die.
[00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:17.934]  So I feel a lot safer right now.
[00:24:17.954 --> 00:24:20.535]  And it's a political correctness show.
[00:24:20.695 --> 00:24:21.695]  We don't do profiling.
[00:24:21.735 --> 00:24:23.396]  No, all of you are scum.
[00:24:23.616 --> 00:24:25.737]  All of you are treated as terrorists.
[00:24:26.237 --> 00:24:29.038]  Doesn't matter if you have no criminal record like the 95-year-old woman does.
[00:24:29.378 --> 00:24:30.558]  That means you're worse.
[00:24:31.318 --> 00:24:35.280]  But if you're criminal record, you get hired to be working for the TSA.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.301]  And it says her mother, who was in a wheelchair, was asked to remove an adult diaper.
[00:24:40.182 --> 00:24:45.085]  In order to complete the pat-down, when they found that it was soiled, they took her behind closed doors for the full deal.
[00:24:45.665 --> 00:24:49.388]  And she goes, I don't understand why they have to put them through this kind of procedure, her daughter said.
[00:24:49.928 --> 00:24:54.031]  She said procedures are the same for everyone to ensure national security.
[00:24:54.918 --> 00:24:56.819]  And now they're rolling out on the streets of America.
[00:24:56.839 --> 00:24:58.560]  I've got the big news coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.801]  I'm not even telling you what the subject is.
[00:25:00.181 --> 00:25:00.761]  Just stay with us.
[00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:11.807]  TSA cannot exempt any group from screening because we know from intelligence... Oh, you know Al-Qaeda was created by the big banks and works for the globalists to take our liberties away?
[00:25:11.827 --> 00:25:14.929]  Oh, you know it's a Hitlerian Reichstag event?
[00:25:15.569 --> 00:25:20.073]  Oh you know from intelligence that all the major Al Qaeda people are trained and protected by the Pentagon on record?
[00:25:20.433 --> 00:25:22.815]  Oh you know from intelligence your boss is carrying out 9-11?
[00:25:23.216 --> 00:25:23.816]  Oh no you're not.
[00:25:24.277 --> 00:25:31.022]  TSA cannot exempt any group from screening because we know intelligence that there are terrorists out there that would exploit that vulnerability.
[00:25:31.122 --> 00:25:31.483]  Yes.
[00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:36.567]  Now they're saying they may want to start chest x-rays because they may put bombs inside of you.
[00:25:38.649 --> 00:25:42.032]  Weber filed a complaint through the Northwest Florida's regional website.
[00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:47.264]  I'm not one that makes waves, but dadgummit, what is wrong?
[00:25:47.365 --> 00:25:48.126]  This is wrong.
[00:25:48.366 --> 00:25:49.107]  People need to know.
[00:25:49.207 --> 00:25:50.389]  Next time it could be you.
[00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:55.977]  She went on to say, I can't believe this is happening in America.
[00:25:56.898 --> 00:25:57.880]  How is this happening?
[00:26:01.235 --> 00:26:05.177]  So, it's all about training you to be dehumanized, to be humiliated.
[00:26:05.417 --> 00:26:10.799]  And all the fake environmentalism is how humanity's ugly, humanity's stupid, humanity's a cancer.
[00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:12.779]  You've got to be bossed around everywhere.
[00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:15.280]  Don't get a plastic bag, don't get a paper one.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:23.604]  You've got to buy one of our Barnes & Noble's plastic bags and have some ninnying woman lean over you and try to make you guilty because you don't.
[00:26:23.884 --> 00:26:24.284]  Meanwhile,
[00:26:24.864 --> 00:26:40.292]  Major corporations are doing things that are devastating the environment, and these very globalists are pushing more nuclear power plants, and simply raising the level of what they say safe radiation is, and covering it up, and cross-species, genetic engineering, and truly dangerous things.
[00:26:41.012 --> 00:26:46.715]  But then they want to lecture you how your activity's bad, so they can create this guilt complex to control you.
[00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:49.011]  You've got the war on males.
[00:26:49.391 --> 00:26:51.192]  I've got reports here, no him or her.
[00:26:51.292 --> 00:26:54.092]  Preschool fights gender bias.
[00:26:54.132 --> 00:26:56.133]  They say being male is inherently bad.
[00:26:56.153 --> 00:26:57.333]  This is Associated Press.
[00:26:57.753 --> 00:26:59.673]  And that you're not allowed to call yourself a boy.
[00:27:00.594 --> 00:27:01.974]  And this is to, quote, help girls.
[00:27:01.994 --> 00:27:04.294]  That matter, girls are 60% of college graduates.
[00:27:04.634 --> 00:27:10.456]  I got the Atlantic Monthly, the end of men, celebrating that women are, quote, taking over.
[00:27:12.236 --> 00:27:16.277]  When they try to divide men and women from each other, they're dividing the human species.
[00:27:17.459 --> 00:27:21.782]  And they're selling women that globalism and tyranny is like mother's milk.
[00:27:21.802 --> 00:27:32.869]  See, women now, on average, the way they're targeted in the psychology are the wives of the state and the bureaucracy and the eugenical eugenics cult.
[00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:35.731]  And all the rest of us are their children.
[00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:37.252]  This is not new.
[00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:50.599]  If you go back to Rome, and I've talked about this a lot in the handbooks written by the Romans that have been republished, or you go back to sugar cane plantations in Hispaniola, what's Dominican Republic today, in Haiti, they have these manuals.
[00:27:50.979 --> 00:28:00.524]  You can go to the library and get them, on how to control black slaves, and they reprinted themselves, the Roman manuals, on German slaves and other slaves they were bringing into Rome.
[00:28:01.625 --> 00:28:14.170]  So understand the President, you've got to know the past, and they said, you bring in the men, you beat them, you kill the leaders, you beat the children, and then you tell the women, you keep them in line, you spy on them, and that's how you protect them.
[00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.572]  And then they'd bring the women into the house, and that's where you get the term of the house slave.
[00:28:18.112 --> 00:28:19.093]  And that's what women are today.
[00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:21.395]  They're the house slaves of the system.
[00:28:21.955 --> 00:28:25.698]  And men, by and large, I mean, that's what the system is slated for you.
[00:28:26.018 --> 00:28:33.184]  Whether you are sophisticated enough to understand that and defeat it and love your men, love your young boys, love your young girls, men love your women.
[00:28:33.364 --> 00:28:36.987]  Now, men then are trained to act like little children to fit into that paradigm.
[00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:42.612]  And, you know, the sports and the sitcoms and most men act like arrested development twelve-year-olds.
[00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:43.432]  That
[00:28:44.213 --> 00:28:45.295]  It is also part of it.
[00:28:45.315 --> 00:28:47.057]  So it's not women are bad or men are bad.
[00:28:47.097 --> 00:28:48.699]  It's that we're all the species.
[00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:49.900]  We are humanity.
[00:28:50.201 --> 00:28:52.544]  It's the male and female that make the species.
[00:28:52.804 --> 00:28:54.086]  We're completely symbiotic.
[00:28:54.546 --> 00:28:55.928]  There's no separation between us.
[00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:58.311]  So women, you might want to actually join humanity.
[00:28:58.551 --> 00:28:59.433]  Realize the programming.
[00:29:02.347 --> 00:29:05.971]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:09.375]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:14.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:20.647]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:29:20.807 --> 00:29:23.050]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.850]  Tim Geithner?
[00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:24.310]  Bernanke?
[00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.010]  They're arsonists!
[00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.331]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:28.591]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:29:42.475 --> 00:29:44.316]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:49.400]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:59.106]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:30:00.848 --> 00:30:05.090]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.011]  Number one.
[00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:09.473]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:10.313]  Number two.
[00:30:10.613 --> 00:30:15.156]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.496 --> 00:30:15.936]  It's true.
[00:30:16.236 --> 00:30:20.799]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.099 --> 00:30:21.659]  Number three.
[00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:25.221]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.521 --> 00:30:29.223]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.423 --> 00:30:29.964]  Number 4.
[00:30:30.224 --> 00:30:32.586]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.987 --> 00:30:36.370]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:36.871]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:41.376]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.616 --> 00:30:46.361]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:50.666]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:50.826 --> 00:30:52.388]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:11.084 --> 00:31:15.165]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[00:31:15.526 --> 00:31:20.707]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[00:31:21.387 --> 00:31:29.392]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:05.754]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:06.094 --> 00:32:09.658]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:12.261]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:17.687]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:18.127 --> 00:32:24.354]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:24.774 --> 00:32:30.317]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:30.737 --> 00:32:34.419]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.939 --> 00:32:38.941]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:39.241 --> 00:32:44.744]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:45.184 --> 00:32:48.125]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:50.166]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:51.127]  It's here.

[00:33:19.445 --> 00:33:21.805]  We are live Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:22.325]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:22.385 --> 00:33:25.646]  Central back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:25.746 --> 00:33:39.350]  Central Okay This is the most important subject I could cover the most important subject I have ever covered
[00:33:42.476 --> 00:33:52.352]  Then, getting into the next hour, I'm going to get back into the economic news, but also the TSA and the dirty tricks in Texas by the Republican Party to kill their own bills.
[00:33:52.672 --> 00:33:55.236]  And Ron Paul's exposing that at the federal level.
[00:33:56.471 --> 00:33:56.831]  Right now.
[00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:14.970]  Indeed are pushing.
[00:34:15.631 --> 00:34:23.253]  So we're going to look at Perry Dewhurst and others, and Joe Strauss, the Speaker of the House and the Treasury they're involved in.
[00:34:24.234 --> 00:34:27.895]  Should I, quote, storm the Capitol again, as the media called it?
[00:34:27.915 --> 00:34:28.836]  We didn't really storm it.
[00:34:28.856 --> 00:34:31.276]  We marched in there and let them know who the boss was.
[00:34:31.296 --> 00:34:36.358]  Because the Houston Chronicle, Lost American Statesman, a bunch of others have pointed out that was very effective.
[00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:39.700]  With a two-hour notice, we got about 200 people there.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.161]  What if we said we were going to all be there tomorrow at 3 o'clock?
[00:34:44.381 --> 00:34:52.286]  You know, they're set to try to vote in the Senate again, but look, I'll break down the dirty tricks next hour and get into all the other really big news.
[00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:58.209]  New York Times admits there never was a recovery and that we're basically in a serious recession.
[00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.812]  Forecasts for growth drop some sharply.
[00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:09.236]  And we've also got some other news that I'm going to be going over, dealing with, as usual,
[00:35:13.154 --> 00:35:20.302]  World Cup, I guess semi-finals, what you can call them, the Gold Cup final there in California.
[00:35:21.523 --> 00:35:28.011]  The illegal alien population there booed the Star Spangled Banner and the
[00:35:30.316 --> 00:35:38.482]  The award ceremony was done in Spanish, and here in America, the American team was basically booed the entire time.
[00:35:39.102 --> 00:35:43.305]  And they interviewed folks, and they said, we're not Americans, we're Mexicans.
[00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:45.327]  And we don't like America.
[00:35:46.247 --> 00:35:50.450]  And I guess in political correctness, I'm supposed to say, well that's great, let's open the borders up even more.
[00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:56.075]  How wonderful that you're booing the American team during the Star Spangled Banner.
[00:35:57.295 --> 00:36:21.672]  And booing throughout and then during the awards ceremony and that's even gotten up the ire of ESPN and the LA Times And again, it just illustrates quite frankly I'm way past all this where you're from what color you are and how they use fake nationalism to put people off against each other My point is can you imagine?
[00:36:21.692 --> 00:36:21.732]  if
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.501]  Americans behave like this?
[00:36:28.441 --> 00:36:39.264]  The issue is, the people in Southern California, A, don't consider themselves to be Americans, a large percentage, but also do not like America.
[00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:50.927]  And they're very proud of the way Mexico runs and is operated, and school children in Texas, in Massachusetts, and in California cannot wear American flags at public schools.
[00:36:50.947 --> 00:36:53.888]  They are told, take them off, that is offensive to the illegal aliens.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.241]  And that's MSNBC.
[00:36:56.261 --> 00:36:57.361]  You remember all those headlines.
[00:36:57.741 --> 00:36:59.042]  See, I'm already digressing.
[00:36:59.062 --> 00:36:59.522]  You know what?
[00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:05.265]  I can't even do justice to the information I'm about to cover.
[00:37:06.626 --> 00:37:08.867]  I can't even do justice to it.
[00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:11.268]  I could barely sleep last night.
[00:37:12.428 --> 00:37:13.609]  I was quiet all day.
[00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:23.414]  And couldn't even really sit there on the floor and paint and draw and do things with my children like I normally do.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:31.385]  Totally focused, absolute clarity and understanding of the entire agenda, how it all ties together.
[00:37:32.086 --> 00:37:33.927]  Five, six pages of notes I wrote.
[00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:49.801]  Could hardly eat my lunch, and I like to eat because I'm so freaked out by this, by how absolutely right I am and how proven right we have been all along on this subject.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:06.607]  I don't even know how to try to address this to you because I don't want to just sit here and tell you that this is my view without then literally giving you the mountains of evidence.
[00:38:06.627 --> 00:38:13.971]  I don't want to say the ruling class is guilty of a global plan to set up world government and carry out total extermination.
[00:38:14.972 --> 00:38:19.934]  Because if you really get into their internal documents, some of which are public, they publicly say they want to kill 80%.
[00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:32.174]  And a lot of their internal writings, but they're still public, and they say 90%, but more and more they say everyone is going to be killed and there will be no humans left on Earth, including the global elite.
[00:38:32.194 --> 00:38:33.735]  And you're like, what are you talking about?
[00:38:33.775 --> 00:38:35.856]  Well, I'm not the one that wrote this.
[00:38:35.976 --> 00:38:38.017]  I'm not the one that said this.
[00:38:39.238 --> 00:38:42.940]  I'm not the one that NASA's official policy is this.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.762]  Google's official policy, Microsoft's official policy.
[00:38:49.301 --> 00:39:12.419]  And whether it's real or not, I mean whether they're going to be able to do this or not, these lunatics say that within the next 15 years they are going to merge with machines and become gods and blast off to Alpha Centauri and that all of us are going to be killed.
[00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:20.536]  And if you're a new listener, I mean, I've made the film Endgame about this from their writings.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.489]  And I'm not talking about obscurist writings here.
[00:39:30.129 --> 00:39:33.111]  And so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to cover other news for the rest of the hour.
[00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:34.512]  I'm just going to do TSA and other things now.
[00:39:34.532 --> 00:39:48.282]  And I'm going to reset and at like 7 after next hour when we come in into the second hour I'm going to try to really focus and try to get that crystalline point in my mind again where I can go through all of this brainstorming.
[00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:52.565]  I mean I've had like a 24 hour brainstorm here and I don't even know how to describe it to you.
[00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:58.035]  I was already thinking about how this is the biggest issue.
[00:39:58.455 --> 00:39:59.516]  It's the only issue.
[00:39:59.596 --> 00:40:11.224]  Everything else is just pieces of that overall compartmentalized superstructure and how much evidence we've got and what we got out of Bilderberg this year and the whole transhumanist agenda.
[00:40:13.761 --> 00:40:22.348]  And then if I don't put on all the evidence, or at least a large portion of it for you, new listeners won't understand how grave this is.
[00:40:22.848 --> 00:40:26.972]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't enjoy being out with friends on a jet boat.
[00:40:27.732 --> 00:40:29.594]  I can't enjoy a beautiful vista anymore.
[00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:30.515]  I can't...
[00:40:31.474 --> 00:40:33.835]  Think about petty or stupid things.
[00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:49.020]  I only have overall shame that I know this level of information and have not, like a monk or something, done nothing but dedicate myself 24 hours a day in a completely pious, focused way
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.902]  To, to, to, to reveal this information to you.
[00:40:52.962 --> 00:40:54.563]  I mean, it's that big.
[00:40:54.904 --> 00:40:55.864]  I'm like, why me?
[00:40:55.964 --> 00:40:57.946]  Why am I the person that analyzed this?
[00:40:58.266 --> 00:41:00.547]  Why am I the person that accurately broke it down?
[00:41:00.927 --> 00:41:05.871]  Why am I one of the only prominent people speaking out against it when it's all there?
[00:41:06.551 --> 00:41:08.052]  Like the back of a cereal box.
[00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:15.237]  I mean, they tell us in, in, in, in horrific, clear-cut statements what they're going to do.
[00:41:17.546 --> 00:41:30.801]  And when you go to the different publications that push this transhumanist agenda, that's just the modern public packaging of neo-Malthusian eugenics.
[00:41:33.735 --> 00:41:42.802]  They're all, every time you track them, these head eugenics people are married to their wife, who's a top scientist, working on airborne Ebola.
[00:41:43.142 --> 00:41:53.610]  And then you go to another group and they're obsessed with airborne weapons to kill us, and they talk about it, and they get funding from the government to, quote, create defenses for it, which they will.
[00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.151]  It's defenses for them when they release it.
[00:41:57.253 --> 00:42:01.254]  God help us, folks, because they're going to start releasing this stuff very, very soon.
[00:42:01.754 --> 00:42:13.378]  They've already released some other soft kills that were just beta tests like HIV and things, and the UN constantly gets caught injecting kids with live syphilis and live smallpox and live polio.
[00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:15.425]  And it's in the news.
[00:42:15.565 --> 00:42:16.505]  Oh, another U.N.
[00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:16.986]  accident.
[00:42:17.246 --> 00:42:19.946]  Thousands of kids injected and died with weaponized polio.
[00:42:19.986 --> 00:42:20.426]  Oopsie.
[00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:21.767]  Oh yeah, the U.N.
[00:42:21.807 --> 00:42:25.847]  got caught injecting kids with a sterilant with their vaccine.
[00:42:25.967 --> 00:42:27.328]  Oh well, there's too many of them anyways.
[00:42:28.448 --> 00:42:38.230]  And to know that this big study came out earlier this week, well now last week, where the U.S.
[00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:41.251]  has the highest infant mortality because of vaccines.
[00:42:42.754 --> 00:42:51.881]  And then to have to see this new Ray Kurzweil movie coming out, where they put out kind of the candy-coated version of it.
[00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:54.322]  Well, The Transcendent Man is a hoax.
[00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:56.544]  It's a bear trap for humanity.
[00:42:56.564 --> 00:42:59.907]  This whole Wirehead system's a kill switch.
[00:43:01.596 --> 00:43:07.018]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:12.980]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:20.142]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:43:22.083 --> 00:43:24.383]  They soak pride in every stitch.
[00:43:26.144 --> 00:43:28.465]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.121]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:43.901]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:43:44.161 --> 00:43:46.722]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:53.303]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:57.804]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:43:57.964 --> 00:43:58.405]  Got it.
[00:43:58.745 --> 00:43:59.605]  Others don't.
[00:44:00.762 --> 00:44:05.005]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:05.585]  Number 1.
[00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:09.368]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:10.208]  Number 2.
[00:44:10.509 --> 00:44:15.072]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:44:15.412 --> 00:44:15.852]  It's true.
[00:44:16.152 --> 00:44:20.715]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:44:21.016 --> 00:44:21.556]  Number 3.
[00:44:21.856 --> 00:44:25.138]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:44:25.438 --> 00:44:29.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:29.882]  Number 4.
[00:44:30.122 --> 00:44:32.484]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:44:32.885 --> 00:44:36.288]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:44:36.569 --> 00:44:36.789]  Number 5.
[00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:41.274]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:44:41.514 --> 00:44:46.279]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:50.583]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.172]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:45:03.392 --> 00:45:08.418]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:45:08.698 --> 00:45:10.060]  Saving means to make money.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:19.030]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:26.854]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:34.897]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:45:35.277 --> 00:45:42.680]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:46:01.542 --> 00:46:05.186]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:46:05.566 --> 00:46:08.570]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:13.575]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:46:13.595 --> 00:46:19.822]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:46:20.002 --> 00:46:22.245]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:46:22.745 --> 00:46:23.045]  Tim Geithner?
[00:46:23.065 --> 00:46:23.506]  Bernanke?
[00:46:23.566 --> 00:46:23.906]  They're arsonists!
[00:46:23.926 --> 00:46:24.686]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:46:24.706 --> 00:46:27.028]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:46:41.678 --> 00:46:43.518]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:46:43.798 --> 00:46:48.559]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:58.862]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:47:05.643 --> 00:47:08.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:11.055 --> 00:47:17.962]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[00:47:18.022 --> 00:47:22.027]  Some men you just can't reach.
[00:47:22.087 --> 00:47:27.272]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[00:47:27.332 --> 00:47:28.653]  Well, he gets it.
[00:47:28.734 --> 00:47:31.056]  I don't like it.
[00:47:37.529 --> 00:47:39.649]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:40.169 --> 00:47:41.550]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:47.571 --> 00:47:59.613]  Now there's the PrisonPlanet.com article on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:47:59.653 --> 00:48:04.094]  If you're not a radio listener, just go to PrisonPlanet.com and you can read the report.
[00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.234]  We'll put it back on screen.
[00:48:06.468 --> 00:48:11.638]  New study finds direct link between vaccines and infant mortality.
[00:48:13.621 --> 00:48:18.290]  The United States, which administers the highest number of vaccines in the developed world,
[00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:23.894]  Also has the highest numbers of infant deaths in the developed world.
[00:48:23.974 --> 00:48:48.722]  A shocking new study published in a prestigious medical journal has found a direct statistical link between higher vaccine dose and infant mortality rates in the developed world, suggesting that the increased number of inoculations being forced upon children by medical authorities, particularly the United States, which administers the highest number of vaccines and also has the highest number of infant deaths, is in fact having a detrimental impact on health.
[00:48:49.062 --> 00:48:50.004]  Also the IQ.
[00:48:50.024 --> 00:48:55.596]  You look at people now, they look, most of them, like they're mildly retarded and they act like it too.
[00:48:56.057 --> 00:48:59.244]  The study entitled infant mortality rates regressed.
[00:49:00.839 --> 00:49:12.282]  Against number of vaccine doses routinely given, is there a biochemical and synergistic toxicity was conducted by Neil Z. Miller and Gary S. Goldman.
[00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:20.185]  It was published in the reputable Human and Experimental Toxicology Journal which is indexed by the National Library of Medicine.
[00:49:20.925 --> 00:49:29.533]  According to the biography, Goldman has received a review for the Journal of the American Medical Association Vaccine.
[00:49:29.553 --> 00:49:31.334]  It goes through all his degrees and reviews.
[00:49:31.655 --> 00:49:37.240]  In British Medical Journal, he is included in the editorial board of Research and Reviews in Bioscience.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:45.848]  Miller, a medical research journalist and the director of the Think Twice Global Vaccine Initiative, has been studying the dangers of vaccines for 25 years.
[00:49:45.948 --> 00:49:46.748]  And it goes through
[00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:54.533]  Government numbers on infant mortality, the United States just a few decades ago, was the safest in the world.
[00:49:54.573 --> 00:49:58.855]  Now we're the worst in the industrialized world and behind a whole bunch of third world nations.
[00:50:00.276 --> 00:50:03.417]  Well, it just so happens, why are these guys even doing studies?
[00:50:04.018 --> 00:50:11.662]  I have the Rockefeller Foundation documents, 1966, about how they developed the vaccines to lower IQ and reduce fertility.
[00:50:12.526 --> 00:50:19.829]  And how they're doing it by this, I mean, I've got Bertrand Russell, Nobel Prize winner, writing reports on how they were going to do this.
[00:50:20.649 --> 00:50:23.550]  I mean, that's what my film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers.
[00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.311]  It's not hard to research this.
[00:50:26.731 --> 00:50:40.876]  That's what's so frustrating, is that, is that, is that we've gone over this, and we understand what's happening, and this country has the sudden death
[00:50:42.052 --> 00:50:48.576]  Infant Sudden Death Syndrome, where they end up trying to charge the parents, saying they shook their kid because they have bleeding on the brain.
[00:50:49.317 --> 00:50:52.219]  And, or, then they claim that it's the mattress killing them.
[00:50:52.239 --> 00:50:54.120]  And now the major studies have been out for many years.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:04.386]  They've kept it quiet though, that they give the child rounds of shots, they have an autoimmune response, and have hemorrhaging in the brain, and they die.
[00:51:04.827 --> 00:51:08.129]  But it turns out the vaccine inserts say it can do that to you!
[00:51:09.093 --> 00:51:27.465]  I mean, I know several radio hosts in Austin who ended up calling me and basically apologizing and saying, one of them did it on air, he said, I thought you were a cook, but I took the flu shot and my hands and feet went numb for a couple months and I went to the doctor and he said, yeah, you had a mild form of Guillain-Barré.
[00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:30.747]  Lucky it didn't kill you from that, I mean, they had it!
[00:51:31.533 --> 00:51:32.474]  That was Dale Dudley.
[00:51:32.534 --> 00:51:34.095]  The other one didn't want me to talk about it on air.
[00:51:35.475 --> 00:51:39.778]  Listen, in the trials of Gardasil, it killed a lot of people that took it.
[00:51:41.159 --> 00:51:45.582]  And then Rick Perry comes out and says, it's the law, you gotta take it, which was a hoax, wasn't the law.
[00:51:46.222 --> 00:51:49.924]  Then Rick Perry, of course, the former campaign manager for Al Gore, oh, you didn't know that?
[00:51:50.265 --> 00:51:55.288]  The guy that got a law passed to pay in-state tuition for illegal aliens, Vicente Fox, came here and what?
[00:51:56.388 --> 00:51:57.689]  2005?
[00:51:57.029 --> 00:51:57.689]  No, 2004?
[00:51:57.729 --> 00:51:58.389]  No, 2005.
[00:51:59.009 --> 00:52:01.811]  I have video of it to give him an award.
[00:52:01.831 --> 00:52:07.593]  And secretly, he'll introduce abortion legislation and kill it.
[00:52:08.573 --> 00:52:11.775]  It's all part of acting like he's this big patriot.
[00:52:12.075 --> 00:52:13.335]  He'll introduce legislation to
[00:52:16.448 --> 00:52:19.310]  Do all sorts of things that sound great, then quietly kill it.
[00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:21.992]  And I'll be covering that later on the whole TSA issue.
[00:52:22.693 --> 00:52:39.945]  But I'll be honest with you, I start thinking to myself, why do I even want to go down and confront the TSA minions, the state of Texas, their servants, and demand they do the right thing, when I know there's a systematic global program to soft kill people in the West.
[00:52:40.325 --> 00:52:45.269]  That means kill you over a long period of time, give you a binary weapon injection, a lot of different things they do.
[00:52:49.312 --> 00:52:54.678]  And then I'm worried about the federal power grab and TSA sticking their hands down your pants.
[00:52:55.219 --> 00:52:57.622]  But then I realized, no, I've got to fight on all fronts.
[00:52:58.222 --> 00:53:03.849]  Because if the feds ever get backed off on any of their power grabs, the world will learn.
[00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:05.770]  That they're not invincible.
[00:53:06.371 --> 00:53:07.251]  That they're not God.
[00:53:07.591 --> 00:53:17.675]  That's why they've sent federal lobbyists down here in the last month to twist arms and threaten people so that Texas doesn't lead the nation in states saying no to the feds.
[00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:22.857]  Because if the states ever get back into their proper role, there goes the foreign banks that have captured
[00:53:24.329 --> 00:53:27.692]  DC, and hence the rest of the nation, through fraud.
[00:53:28.373 --> 00:53:30.435]  So they can never let states have any victory.
[00:53:30.695 --> 00:53:34.459]  They've always got to press more and more, you know, insane garbage on people.
[00:53:34.779 --> 00:53:48.232]  And that's why Perry would do something so brazen, so naked, to try to hand over 8,000 miles of Texas roads to toll roads for foreign companies that had bought off the legislature, even though it was incredibly unpopular in Texas.
[00:53:49.053 --> 00:53:53.741]  Was because it's an agenda and it's not his job to serve the people or to care about Texas.
[00:53:53.781 --> 00:53:54.942]  It's not Obama's job.
[00:53:55.303 --> 00:53:56.505]  It's not Newt Gingrich's job.
[00:53:56.565 --> 00:53:57.567]  It wasn't Bill Clinton's job.
[00:53:58.007 --> 00:54:02.595]  It's their job to make you think they represent you while they stab you in the back.
[00:54:04.582 --> 00:54:08.185]  And they're in a dime's worth of difference between Al Gore and his former campaign manager.
[00:54:08.605 --> 00:54:09.345]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:54:09.365 --> 00:54:11.307]  That's Texas Monthly Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:11.347 --> 00:54:14.209]  Just type in Rick Perry, former Al Gore campaign manager.
[00:54:14.449 --> 00:54:16.631]  Oh, you didn't know he supported Sanctuary Cities?
[00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:27.739]  See, he's the one that helped get it in in Texas, under the guise of a banking act, letting them not have IDs to get bank accounts, and the in-state tuition.
[00:54:28.715 --> 00:54:34.199]  But see, now he has bills that, oh, magically, you know, are on the verge of getting defeated or won't get implemented.
[00:54:34.799 --> 00:54:38.762]  And, oh, it's a number one priority, he said a month ago, to have that TSA bill.
[00:54:40.623 --> 00:54:45.486]  And then they pass it unanimously in the House, so he has the Senate kill it through Dewhurst.
[00:54:45.526 --> 00:54:48.088]  Dewhurst tells senators, don't let folks know I'm doing this for the governor.
[00:54:48.588 --> 00:54:49.429]  Keep this secret.
[00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:51.110]  That comes out.
[00:54:52.347 --> 00:54:55.129]  I have state reps on and I go, you know Perry's going to kill it this week.
[00:54:55.169 --> 00:54:56.409]  You know he's going to pull another.
[00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:57.850]  Oh, I want to believe in the governor.
[00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:00.111]  David Simpson and others said, the author of the bill.
[00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:00.832]  I said, you watch.
[00:55:01.332 --> 00:55:09.756]  Simpson had to come out in the Austin American Statesman and other papers yesterday and today and say, unfortunately the governor is behind this and I'm really shocked by it.
[00:55:10.116 --> 00:55:13.098]  Well, don't be shocked by Al Gore's former chief of staff.
[00:55:13.238 --> 00:55:16.640]  I mean, he's here to bring down this country.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.302]  He's here to fool conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalists.
[00:55:21.022 --> 00:55:22.582]  If they can't beat us, they join us.
[00:55:23.323 --> 00:55:30.024]  But they, I mean, you know, there were Germans that infiltrated this country in World War II that spoke perfect English and wore U.S.
[00:55:30.084 --> 00:55:30.884]  Army uniforms.
[00:55:31.684 --> 00:55:37.405]  It didn't mean that, you know, they didn't need to be caught on base trying to blow up ammo depots in New York.
[00:55:38.226 --> 00:55:41.326]  You're like, but they speak good English and they're wearing American uniforms.
[00:55:41.746 --> 00:55:47.168]  Well, Rick Perry talks good talk about shooting coyotes and the Second Amendment and Texas secession.
[00:55:47.628 --> 00:55:49.128]  It's all theater.
[00:55:50.239 --> 00:55:51.119]  It's all theater.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.281]  And so then he got caught lying a week and a half ago.
[00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:57.462]  There's not time on the session and we don't have the votes.
[00:55:58.142 --> 00:56:01.484]  And so he got open letters sent to him going, we have super majorities.
[00:56:01.764 --> 00:56:02.664]  We're ready to pass it.
[00:56:04.345 --> 00:56:09.687]  And so he said, okay, I'll put it on, but I'll put it on Friday when they'll have a couple of days left this week.
[00:56:10.407 --> 00:56:12.868]  They have to suspend the third reading to even get it passed now.
[00:56:13.108 --> 00:56:14.509]  So he's running out the clock on us.
[00:56:14.909 --> 00:56:25.274]  It's like having a coach that's been paid off by the mafia to make your team lose, and he's got to act like he's making good plays, but people keep catching him, you know, dropping the ball intentionally.
[00:56:26.755 --> 00:56:29.856]  And Ron Paul's on record saying it's the same thing.
[00:56:29.876 --> 00:56:29.916]  U.S.
[00:56:31.037 --> 00:56:33.958]  House keeps Libya funding, fails to authorize mission.
[00:56:35.609 --> 00:56:40.430]  So they actually give them the money, but then say they don't authorize it, because they weren't asked to authorize it.
[00:56:41.671 --> 00:56:51.913]  Ron Paul slams absurd Libya war powers debate, and it goes on to say that today Paul told his colleagues that the limited funding bill was not what it appeared to be.
[00:56:51.933 --> 00:56:58.935]  Paul argues the Libya bill masquerades as a limitation on funds for the President's war on Libya, but in fact is an authorization for what
[00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:01.038]  For the very war.
[00:57:01.959 --> 00:57:03.141]  It's the same thing in Texas.
[00:57:03.883 --> 00:57:12.860]  You got Al Gore's little darling in there, Mr. Sanctuary City, who's fighting the sanctuary cities, but getting awards from the Mexican president for them.
[00:57:14.271 --> 00:57:18.172]  You got a guy who tries to force little girls to take deadly vaccines.
[00:57:18.892 --> 00:57:21.213]  All part of this agenda of power grabs.
[00:57:21.473 --> 00:57:34.616]  You got a guy who got all these new taxes passed, doubled the size of Texas government, the budget, in his 10 years, and he tells us Texas has green grass and that cows are healthy and there's prosperity because of him.
[00:57:35.576 --> 00:57:35.937]  Okay?
[00:57:36.378 --> 00:57:38.140]  Again, that's how they do it.
[00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:45.211]  And that's why until people grow up and get smart and actually research the deep facts, you'll continue to be bamboozled.
[00:57:45.512 --> 00:57:46.213]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:52.492 --> 00:58:00.999]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[00:58:01.499 --> 00:58:05.562]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[00:58:05.943 --> 00:58:11.127]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[00:58:11.787 --> 00:58:19.813]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[00:58:20.133 --> 00:58:25.577]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.
[00:58:29.319 --> 00:58:35.705]  Your time is running out to build your supply with the best food on the planet at last year's prices with eFoods Direct.
[00:58:36.005 --> 00:58:36.205]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:58:36.225 --> 00:58:37.966]  Prices go up at the end of June.

[00:58:40.649 --> 00:58:43.931]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:58:52.182 --> 00:58:53.684]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.904 --> 00:58:58.929]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:59.209 --> 00:59:00.570]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.751 --> 00:59:09.539]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:17.362]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.802 --> 00:59:25.404]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.804 --> 00:59:33.186]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:59:35.967 --> 00:59:38.890]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:41.473]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:59:42.193 --> 00:59:47.178]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:59:51.983 --> 00:59:53.124]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:53.505 --> 00:59:54.866]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.567 --> 00:59:58.770]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:08.689]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:12.351]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.173 --> 01:00:19.896]  Okay, I'm getting into the transhumanist cult, and that's who runs the planet.
[01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:22.898]  That's the modern name of the eugenicist.
[01:00:24.019 --> 01:00:25.660]  Julian Huxley changed the name.
[01:00:27.278 --> 01:00:36.542]  When he was the head of the United Nations UNESCO program and wrote a big white paper that we linked to in Endgame, what is the endgame.com, the online bibliography.
[01:00:36.903 --> 01:00:41.725]  That's what's so crazy about this is I've got, all I do is read their internal handbooks and stuff that's public.
[01:00:42.145 --> 01:00:44.626]  They think they've beaten us so bad that they don't even care.
[01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:46.607]  They just prance around publicly.
[01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:52.990]  And I was at a dinner party last night and it was biologists, a molecular biologist,
[01:00:57.352 --> 01:01:05.273]  Doctors, you name it, and they were telling me about all this, and it just reminded me of just how widespread this is.
[01:01:06.094 --> 01:01:10.654]  And now it's being rolled out in the public, so that's coming up.
[01:01:10.894 --> 01:01:12.695]  Oh, it was marine biologists as well.
[01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:13.975]  I forgot that one.
[01:01:15.075 --> 01:01:16.435]  But that's all these people talk about.
[01:01:17.736 --> 01:01:20.456]  That's all anybody with a PhD talks about.
[01:01:21.536 --> 01:01:24.357]  And most of them, I've noticed in the past, thought they were going to be part of it.
[01:01:24.397 --> 01:01:25.417]  These folks knew they weren't.
[01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:37.379]  They all acted like folks that knew they were getting ready to be lined up in front of a firing squad because one of them was a consultant to big corporations and government and he knew all about it and was pretty freaked out.
[01:01:37.799 --> 01:01:39.100]  But they didn't even know who I was.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.002]  They knew because they work in and around these people.
[01:01:42.983 --> 01:01:45.304]  And that's why you'll notice none of these people have children.
[01:01:45.324 --> 01:01:51.549]  And they told me about going dark and how most of the intelligentsia is just preparing to die.
[01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:53.810]  I can't believe it.
[01:01:53.830 --> 01:02:00.634]  Meanwhile, you've got the general public running around telling you about basketball and football, and the average male driving around acting tough in their truck.
[01:02:00.914 --> 01:02:03.895]  Meanwhile, they're poisoning your food, your water, you're under full attack.
[01:02:05.016 --> 01:02:05.876]  I can't handle it anymore.
[01:02:06.076 --> 01:02:06.937]  I'm sorry, it's coming up.
[01:02:09.338 --> 01:02:10.658]  This makes me rethink everything.
[01:02:10.678 --> 01:02:14.660]  I mean, I'm a guy who's been a trailblazer exposing it all, but it's just how real it is.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.701]  They're really doing it.
[01:02:16.394 --> 01:02:19.636]  They're really... I want to go to this two-minute video.
[01:02:19.916 --> 01:02:25.861]  The Rochester police ticket supporters of woman arrested for recording cop in Rochester, New York.
[01:02:25.901 --> 01:02:30.143]  If you dare protest against the thuggish behavior of the local cops, you might get a big fat ticket.
[01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:34.807]  For radio listeners, they've got like five or six squad cars pulled up at a community event.
[01:02:36.172 --> 01:02:40.095]  For support of the woman arrested for filming police from her own yard, Emily Good.
[01:02:40.115 --> 01:02:47.081]  And Kurt goes on to say, this is what you would expect in a communist country or some tin horn dictatorship, not in America.
[01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:48.402]  And the cops are out with rulers.
[01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:54.187]  And if they're 12 and a half inches out from the curb, it's big wide streets, they give them tickets.
[01:02:55.007 --> 01:02:59.448]  And it's big, tough cops with tattoos getting off on it.
[01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:03.330]  They're going to show you for putting that viral video out.
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:05.370]  They're going to show you trying to stand up.
[01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:06.771]  They're going to show you little people.
[01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:09.151]  They're going to videotape you and listen to your phone calls.
[01:03:09.672 --> 01:03:12.292]  But you're not going to videotape them.
[01:03:12.713 --> 01:03:17.954]  So here they are trying to politically persecute the folks that we're meeting to defend this woman.
[01:03:18.234 --> 01:03:19.935]  I mean, this is beyond evil.
[01:03:19.955 --> 01:03:20.235]  Here it is.
[01:03:24.986 --> 01:03:26.707]  Imagine, they've got better things to do.
[01:03:28.828 --> 01:03:30.289]  Crime's going on all over Rochester.
[01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.929]  High crime.
[01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:34.311]  W80, W94, W74.
[01:03:34.331 --> 01:03:37.853]  And all these cop cars, they're giving them tickets.
[01:03:40.594 --> 01:03:43.616]  Again, riding them parking tickets for being more than a foot out from the curb.
[01:03:45.977 --> 01:03:47.178]  Twelve inches from the curb.
[01:03:47.918 --> 01:03:48.478]  You have a ruler?
[01:03:48.498 --> 01:03:49.859]  Because I don't think this is twelve.
[01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:50.559]  Can I see it?
[01:03:50.739 --> 01:03:51.480]  Can I see the ruler?
[01:03:56.036 --> 01:03:58.577]  Okay, that's 12 inches from the curb.
[01:03:59.237 --> 01:04:00.117]  About a half inch.
[01:04:00.157 --> 01:04:02.058]  Yeah, I guess it's about a... Oh, really?
[01:04:02.078 --> 01:04:03.238]  You had civilian complaints?
[01:04:03.638 --> 01:04:04.199]  Civilian?
[01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:04.779]  You're a scum.
[01:04:05.099 --> 01:04:08.300]  You mean the parking being further than 12 inches from the curb?
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.000]  Ma'am, could you make sure you get that in one place?
[01:04:10.481 --> 01:04:12.261]  Look how they swagger like goons.
[01:04:13.362 --> 01:04:15.222]  A law that's suddenly being enforced.
[01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.763]  I've been in third world countries and seen that look.
[01:04:20.172 --> 01:04:22.953]  Those cops are our brothers, though.
[01:04:23.733 --> 01:04:25.754]  They don't know they're being poisoned.
[01:04:25.774 --> 01:04:27.675]  They don't know they're being killed.
[01:04:27.695 --> 01:04:28.695]  They don't know whose team they're on.
[01:04:30.496 --> 01:04:31.296]  They're like little boys.
[01:04:32.756 --> 01:04:36.398]  I'm sorry you guys are this upset about what one of your officers did, that you have to behave this way.
[01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.099]  That's a Rochester Intermedia.
[01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:44.220]  Alright, we'll be right back and get into the big enchilada.
[01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:48.422]  And I'm gonna tell ya, I'm not...
[01:04:49.562 --> 01:04:53.745]  As bad as this is going to sound, I can't describe to you how much worse it is, okay?
[01:04:53.905 --> 01:04:56.326]  There's no way to really give you the full story.
[01:04:56.346 --> 01:04:58.427]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:15.518]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:16.536 --> 01:05:20.258]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:21.238 --> 01:05:33.245]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:05:34.005 --> 01:05:41.269]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:41.949 --> 01:05:51.559]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.603]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:59.367]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:06:02.691 --> 01:06:06.232]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:06:06.532 --> 01:06:11.353]  In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:21.695]  Okay, I want to beg the listeners of this radio broadcast.
[01:06:21.715 --> 01:06:22.275]  We are live.
[01:06:22.295 --> 01:06:25.116]  It is Sunday, the 26th day of June, 2011.
[01:06:25.996 --> 01:06:30.177]  I want to beg you to get a pen and paper.
[01:06:31.428 --> 01:06:56.483]  Because without your help, and without my help, without us working together, and facing the facts, and knowing the facts, and then realizing how full-spectrum this scientific attack on humanity is, and what the endgame is of the globalists, and what their beyond-the-endgame program is, as I say on the back cover of Endgame, for the New World Order, world government is only the beginning.
[01:06:58.334 --> 01:07:02.639]  Once their planetary regime is in place, they will exterminate the majority of the planet.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.585]  The elite will then merge with machines and become a new species.
[01:07:07.645 --> 01:07:10.749]  Now, that sounds completely insane.
[01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:12.070]  I'm not the one saying it.
[01:07:12.591 --> 01:07:13.231]  Ted Turner,
[01:07:15.082 --> 01:07:21.365]  The heads of Google, Bill Gates, Ray Kurzweil, William Shatner, all of them!
[01:07:21.665 --> 01:07:28.268]  They have big, giant, closed-door conferences with thousands of these people at them, and they all write books, world government's coming, we're gonna...
[01:07:29.176 --> 01:07:29.776]  It's insane.
[01:07:30.457 --> 01:07:31.697]  And you're not going to have a choice.
[01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:33.258]  And this is the way it is.
[01:07:33.578 --> 01:07:35.458]  And we're going to save the Earth through this.
[01:07:35.919 --> 01:07:43.861]  And no matter how much GMO we put out, even if it hurts the Earth, it's all natural because whatever humans do is part of evolution.
[01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:47.423]  But then meanwhile, they sell us fake environmentalism.
[01:07:48.323 --> 01:07:52.344]  To give up our rights, to let them shut down our industry, to only control us.
[01:07:52.384 --> 01:07:54.464]  So it's a very sophisticated issue.
[01:07:55.024 --> 01:08:01.525]  But you can see it mirrored in primitive times, when if the Romans didn't like a group of people, they'd conquer, they would just kill everyone.
[01:08:02.206 --> 01:08:05.526]  The Israelites were told, go in, kill everybody, take over the land.
[01:08:05.926 --> 01:08:09.927]  Every culture, different Native American tribes, would just kill the entire tribe.
[01:08:10.267 --> 01:08:11.387]  The Aztecs would do that.
[01:08:11.907 --> 01:08:14.748]  So this is something that oligarchies and corrupt elites do.
[01:08:15.868 --> 01:08:20.870]  I mean, they're like, we're going to win this war 100%, we're going to kill the entire opposition.
[01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:37.918]  But this comes out of Malthusian and then Darwinistic ideas of social Darwinism, that it's their right to do this to us, because if they can fool us and get this done, then they're doing evolution a favor by wiping us out, and that they're going to merge and become this new species.
[01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:47.351]  What kicked off this brainstorm is I've known this has been the central issue for 16 years I've been on air from reading their own publications.
[01:08:50.034 --> 01:08:56.516]  And that first head of the UN UNESCO program, Julian Huxley and others, who said Hitler made us look bad as eugenicists.
[01:08:56.776 --> 01:09:07.379]  We're going to call it transhumanism and sell the public on us controlling them with chemicals, biologicals and also electronic systems as it being a new level of humanity.
[01:09:07.699 --> 01:09:11.400]  But really the systems we're going to engineer, so they theoretically developed it,
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:19.725]  We'll surveil them, control them, and track them and predict what they're going to do as an electronic straitjacket to help phase them out.
[01:09:20.185 --> 01:09:39.316]  And diet injections and injunctions, what we put in their GMO food, what we inject them with, and how we train them will have them believe that humanity is bad as a group collective and accept that it's good that humanity is soon going to be annihilated.
[01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:46.853]  And they have all these TV shows for kids and adults, the world without humans, how great it's going to be, humans are a parasite, a disease.
[01:09:47.153 --> 01:09:54.658]  You're being given a collective dose of psychological death to believe this is all good, and then also hate your fellow man.
[01:09:54.999 --> 01:10:04.385]  Not have the idea of humans reaching for something greater, seeing the beauty of art, and music, and mathematics, and honoring inventors in science.
[01:10:05.045 --> 01:10:05.846]  They're talking about
[01:10:07.145 --> 01:10:19.793]  Dishonoring all of that, the scientific dictatorship having a breakaway civilization under global national security, corporate security, that we are not allowed to be transcendent and inner.
[01:10:20.494 --> 01:10:26.998]  Now whether any of this is actually going to happen or not, this is what the entire modern infrastructure, pre-computer,
[01:10:29.406 --> 01:10:33.790]  Biometrics, 150-year-old science for genetics and racial hygiene.
[01:10:35.212 --> 01:10:41.258]  Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics Lab, the Human Genome Project, for global extermination, for race-specific bioweapons.
[01:10:44.622 --> 01:10:53.927]  All of this, the founder of IBM, the first computers, the Hollerith machines, were to decide how to round up blacks and kill them.
[01:10:53.947 --> 01:10:58.170]  Then Hitler said, I love it, and IBM, Mr. Watson loved it.
[01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:06.995]  He sent technicians to Germany, and throughout the war, and that was what the Jews and others had on their arm, was a number to be entered in the IBM machine to decide how long to work them before you kill them.
[01:11:07.455 --> 01:11:26.241]  Now we just have an NSA Google model that's tracking everybody, figuring out exactly who you really are, what's going to be done to you, how it's all standardized, baby's blood for now 39 years, taken secretly globally, global government set up more than 50 years ago, total standardization, they're mopping up the few final countries they don't control.
[01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:28.622]  Now, that said, I'm going to go to this video clip.
[01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:31.703]  I'm at this dinner party with next-door neighbors.
[01:11:31.723 --> 01:11:32.563]  I get invited over there.
[01:11:33.786 --> 01:11:47.258]  And they had marine biologists and binocular biologists and doctors and corporate integration team leader fusion PhDs.
[01:11:47.859 --> 01:11:51.802]  And none of them knew who I was, which is a rarity, except the folks that invited me.
[01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:55.104]  And they were there working with some filmmakers, is why I was invited.
[01:11:55.124 --> 01:12:03.448]  And they said, Alex, what we're worried about if you're a talk show host is the thing that the hospitals have really been set up to kill people now, but it's compartmentalized.
[01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:04.648]  The doctors don't even know.
[01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:08.710]  And that it's more dangerous to go to the hospital.
[01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:31.711]  You know then to not and and you know this is all being engineered in and as Ray Kurzweil saying they're about to merge with machines and the technology is doubling now every year and computers will be a trillion times faster than humans within you know 20 years and the future doesn't need us and the global elite plan to you know do all of this and I said no I know about all that and I told the guy a few things was wow you know about that
[01:12:32.171 --> 01:12:32.972]  And I said, yes.
[01:12:33.352 --> 01:12:38.736]  And he says, well, how do you fight going dark like so many other people are doing?
[01:12:38.776 --> 01:12:39.557]  And I said, what do you mean?
[01:12:39.577 --> 01:12:48.443]  He goes, well, so many people that are learning about this, there's the decision to join it or there's the, you know, there's the decision to go dark and just spend the time you've got with your family.
[01:12:49.904 --> 01:12:53.606]  And just prepare for all of this.
[01:12:54.366 --> 01:13:02.130]  And he said, well, the way we're going to be able to beat the machines, as Kurzweil says, is because they're going to be so much faster as we much merge ahead of time.
[01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.371]  So there's a race of who will merge first.
[01:13:04.611 --> 01:13:06.592]  So it's like an arms race, but it's a tech race.
[01:13:06.972 --> 01:13:12.395]  Now, again, whether all of this is really going to happen or not, and much of it has,
[01:13:14.096 --> 01:13:21.078]  Kurzweil, and we'll play when we come back from break, Kurzweil has a new movie coming out that everybody's sending me and hyping, and have you ever heard of this?
[01:13:21.118 --> 01:13:38.763]  Yeah, I made a film about it four years ago, and not just with Kurzweil's quotes, and it's this happy-go-lucky, you know, thing about he's optimistic about humanity, and we're gonna merge with machines, and the t-shirt they sell is get ready, you know, for, you know, for evolution, and it's the next level.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:45.467]  What they don't tell you is Kurzweil and all these people, and his main benefactor is Google and Bill Gates.
[01:13:45.927 --> 01:13:48.670]  Bill Gates' daddy, government and army intelligence, and then...
[01:13:49.761 --> 01:13:58.665]  They had a Planned Parenthood and Gates is openly trying to produce vaccines that are delivered through mosquitoes so you can't get away from it and saying we need zero human growth.
[01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:06.789]  I mean, this is a really nasty guy, but it's always packaged in how sweet and loving it is for the general public, the unwashed masses, the football fans.
[01:14:07.249 --> 01:14:11.852]  For the intelligentsia mid-level, it's, well, we've got to get rid of the general public because they're hurting the earth.
[01:14:12.594 --> 01:14:19.541]  But then, for the higher level crust, Hollywood, you know, the heads of Google, others, they're openly told.
[01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:26.868]  That's why Hollywood's so into my show, because they were told this stuff years ago in secret at these meetings, and now they hear me talking about it, making films about it.
[01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:30.852]  Because I reverse engineered the whole thing, and they're like, wow, how do you know about this?
[01:14:31.353 --> 01:14:32.094]  By the way, I've had
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.162]  As big as it gets in media, contact me in the last few weeks.
[01:14:36.182 --> 01:14:39.043]  We're going to see if we get them on the show, but they're really waking up.
[01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:40.584]  But not because of me.
[01:14:40.965 --> 01:14:42.546]  Because they're at the highest levels.
[01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:43.826]  They're hearing all this.
[01:14:43.866 --> 01:14:45.127]  They're being invited in.
[01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.088]  Okay?
[01:14:46.468 --> 01:14:48.249]  And they're getting very close to this, folks.
[01:14:49.269 --> 01:14:53.212]  Now, they think you're stupid and won't be smart enough to look into all this and find out I'm telling you the truth.
[01:14:53.592 --> 01:14:54.913]  They think they've got you.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:56.741]  Okay?
[01:14:57.221 --> 01:15:01.126]  Well, I say we can't give human development over to these people without at least a debate.
[01:15:01.847 --> 01:15:12.320]  And these people have shown themselves to be so sadistic and wicked and hateful and reckless that they should not be directing human development.
[01:15:13.114 --> 01:15:15.637]  Let me just give you a few headlines before we go to break so you get what I'm talking about.
[01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:19.822]  Ray Kurzweil to head futurology school backed by NASA and Google.
[01:15:20.062 --> 01:15:23.125]  Well, Google is an NSA slash DARPA NASA program.
[01:15:23.406 --> 01:15:25.128]  What is the official NASA policy now?
[01:15:25.568 --> 01:15:26.789]  Post-industrial world.
[01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:28.451]  Shutting off your family.
[01:15:28.752 --> 01:15:29.252]  Killing you.
[01:15:29.953 --> 01:15:30.474]  Go look it up.
[01:15:31.857 --> 01:15:34.338]  Here's CNN, the smartest futurist on Earth.
[01:15:35.038 --> 01:15:40.900]  Legendary inventor Ray Kurzweil is right, the future will be a lot brighter and weirder than you think.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:49.823]  So they're gonna sell these nightmare things they're about to do to us with this public thing about, oh, it's this little genius, Ray Kurzweil.
[01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:52.143]  Kurzweil didn't come up with hardly any of this.
[01:15:52.603 --> 01:15:53.944]  He just put a modern spin.
[01:15:54.304 --> 01:15:56.605]  There were theorists 150 years ago in England who envisioned all of it.
[01:16:01.018 --> 01:16:05.241]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:06.182]  Number one.
[01:16:06.482 --> 01:16:09.625]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:16:09.905 --> 01:16:10.485]  Number two.
[01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:15.309]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:16.110]  It's true.
[01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:20.953]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:16:21.274 --> 01:16:21.834]  Number three.
[01:16:22.094 --> 01:16:25.377]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:16:25.677 --> 01:16:29.380]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.140]  Number 4.
[01:16:30.381 --> 01:16:32.742]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:16:33.143 --> 01:16:36.525]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:37.025]  Number 5.
[01:16:37.606 --> 01:16:41.528]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:16:41.749 --> 01:16:46.512]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:17:07.944 --> 01:17:12.706]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:14.948]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:17:17.148 --> 01:17:27.993]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:17:30.305 --> 01:17:34.167]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:38.008]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:39.529]  Others don't.
[01:17:39.949 --> 01:17:41.850]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:43.611]  Diamond gusset jeans.

[01:17:58.477 --> 01:17:59.338]  Others don't.
[01:18:01.966 --> 01:18:10.475]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[01:18:10.956 --> 01:18:15.040]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:18:15.421 --> 01:18:20.607]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:18:21.267 --> 01:18:29.275]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.

[01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:05.690]  Tyranny is here.
[01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:09.632]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:19:09.932 --> 01:19:12.153]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:19:12.173 --> 01:19:17.615]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:19:18.035 --> 01:19:24.277]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:19:24.697 --> 01:19:30.238]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:34.359]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:38.860]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:44.641]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:48.061]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:19:48.641 --> 01:19:50.062]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:19:50.622 --> 01:19:51.042]  It's here.

[01:20:05.574 --> 01:20:08.777]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:16.784 --> 01:20:42.090]  Okay, so, almost four years ago in my film, The Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and it's the blueprint from their own stated plans, the film has whatistheendgame.com, or endgamethemovie.com, that has an online bibliography for the whole documentary, and unfortunately, the documentary's only been seen around 10 million times for free on the internet, and people are like, unfortunately?
[01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:43.971]  That isn't a lot?
[01:20:44.031 --> 01:20:44.571]  No, it's not.
[01:20:45.191 --> 01:20:47.872]  Films like The Obama Deception, over 30 million times.
[01:20:48.372 --> 01:20:50.213]  Fall of the Republic, over 20 million times.
[01:20:50.773 --> 01:20:53.134]  Some of my other films, more than 15 million times.
[01:20:53.595 --> 01:20:55.615]  Endgame is the most important film I've ever made.
[01:20:56.056 --> 01:20:56.476]  Period.
[01:20:56.996 --> 01:20:57.356]  Period.
[01:20:57.396 --> 01:20:58.136]  And it's evergreen.
[01:20:58.497 --> 01:21:01.338]  It's more powerful today than when I made it four years ago.
[01:21:02.438 --> 01:21:03.479]  And it's all their words.
[01:21:04.539 --> 01:21:09.501]  The most powerful people in the world, all they talk about is not dying.
[01:21:09.601 --> 01:21:10.962]  Of course, use common sense.
[01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:17.993]  I mean, 20 years ago, they synthesized genetically perfect, cloned human growth hormone.
[01:21:20.855 --> 01:21:22.196]  Can you imagine what they've got now?
[01:21:22.296 --> 01:21:25.518]  Well, under this global government system, you're not going to get access to that.
[01:21:26.498 --> 01:21:30.421]  And they already have life extension systems if you follow these regimens.
[01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:38.306]  And if you don't get, you know, your head chopped off in a car accident, where you'll be able to live several hundred years, and if you're able to do that,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.846]  They practice all this medicine on us, then it gets compartmentalized.
[01:21:42.886 --> 01:21:44.368]  What works is given to them.
[01:21:44.429 --> 01:21:45.310]  We get all the garbage.
[01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:51.753]  Then now they're going after our health, food, minerals, things that would help us to block the public from getting it.
[01:21:52.493 --> 01:21:54.114]  What would you do if you were a billionaire?
[01:21:54.174 --> 01:21:54.794]  What would you do?
[01:21:55.274 --> 01:21:55.815]  What would you do?
[01:21:55.855 --> 01:21:57.936]  Well, you would see the rest of the public as scum.
[01:21:58.716 --> 01:21:59.797]  You would go to these big meetings.
[01:22:00.197 --> 01:22:07.100]  You would be told, join the world government, join the collectivist elite program, and we'll transfer the general public's wealth to you.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:11.963]  We'll wipe them out in an orderly, compartmentalized function while we pose as the saviors.
[01:22:13.343 --> 01:22:15.645]  And they're going to have, instead of drug enforcement, they're going to have
[01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:18.851]  Brain augmentation enforcement.
[01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:21.853]  People are going to be getting arrested for augmentation that's illegal.
[01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:29.417]  And you'll be happy to not have kids ever again if you're given a nice apartment left alone and are allowed to hook into a system that gives you unlimited pleasure.
[01:22:29.877 --> 01:22:31.919]  You're not going to want to even go on and live.
[01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.120]  And they have forecast all of this.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:49.344]  And so all the tech they're selling us has back doors and spying systems built into it, and all the tech that Kurzweil and others are going to turn loose, NASA, Google, Microsoft funding all of this on you, is going to be almost impossible to turn down.
[01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:54.245]  And this is just one level of the technology while they get the real stuff.
[01:22:54.445 --> 01:22:56.146]  And they write about that like you're an idiot.
[01:22:56.466 --> 01:22:59.306]  Here is the new trailer for the new Kurzweil movie.
[01:22:59.326 --> 01:23:01.227]  Remember, this is coming out in August.
[01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:07.008]  And I got laughed at for saying, once they have their world government, they believe they'll be able to live forever.
[01:23:07.428 --> 01:23:13.952]  That's all from Google, from Schmidt, and Gates, and Turner, and all of them.
[01:23:14.313 --> 01:23:18.956]  Prince Philip, Prince Charles, that's all they do!
[01:23:18.976 --> 01:23:19.556]  24-7!
[01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:21.277]  They don't take vaccines.
[01:23:21.317 --> 01:23:22.598]  They don't eat GMO food.
[01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:23.939]  They have their own farms.
[01:23:23.979 --> 01:23:24.559]  They admit it.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.523]  They have emergency underground seed vaults for after they've wrecked everything to redesign it.
[01:23:30.103 --> 01:23:31.064]  These people are crazy!
[01:23:31.784 --> 01:23:34.105]  The point is, I'm not the crazy one reporting this to you!
[01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:34.805]  Alright, alright.
[01:23:35.045 --> 01:23:35.585]  Here's the trailer.
[01:23:35.625 --> 01:23:35.965]  Here it is.
[01:23:41.207 --> 01:23:54.770]  The reason I'm calling today is to express my disappointment that you have invited this highly sophisticated crackpot and given him a national forum to express his pseudo-religious predictions that have no basis in objective reality.
[01:23:56.811 --> 01:23:59.772]  If you go back 500 years, not much happened in a century.
[01:24:00.737 --> 01:24:02.299]  Now a lot happens in six months.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.344]  Technology feeds on itself and it gets faster and faster.
[01:24:05.924 --> 01:24:06.686]  It's going to continue.
[01:24:06.726 --> 01:24:14.657]  In about 40 years, it's going to be moving so fast, the pace of change is going to be so astonishingly quick that you won't be able to follow it unless...
[01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:21.253]  You enhance your own intelligence by merging with the intelligent technology we've created.
[01:24:21.873 --> 01:24:23.714]  This guy is freaky.
[01:24:23.874 --> 01:24:28.796]  He says computers will have consciousness in just 25 years.
[01:24:28.816 --> 01:24:33.999]  If we get to the 2030s, you're not going to be able to tell a clear difference between human and machine intelligence.
[01:24:34.079 --> 01:24:35.659]  The big question of life is, who are we?
[01:24:35.679 --> 01:24:36.680]  What are we going to become?
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.440]  What's the future like?
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.643]  And he's got one of the most incredible track records in history for predicting pretty darn good accuracy.
[01:24:45.523 --> 01:24:52.768]  He's an award-winning scientist and engineer, a millionaire several times over because of his inventions.
[01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:57.212]  These inventions may end up causing the worst war that humanity's ever had.
[01:24:57.552 --> 01:25:05.978]  Corporations and governments and societies will be created and destroyed on the back of the technology that this book describes.
[01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:14.246]  Inventor Ray Kurzweil thinks that one day humans may be able to live forever.
[01:25:14.266 --> 01:25:16.607]  I want to live as long as I can.
[01:25:16.948 --> 01:25:17.828]  I don't want to die.
[01:25:18.148 --> 01:25:25.392]  If following Ray's regimen would put that day off, I'm very willing to do that.
[01:25:26.592 --> 01:25:29.954]  I knew there was a reason I was keeping all this stuff, and he kept all this stuff.
[01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:34.676]  I do plan to bring back my father.
[01:25:36.717 --> 01:25:37.238]  God is.
[01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:39.243]  I'm afraid of you!
[01:25:48.624 --> 01:25:49.685]  It's gonna scare a lot of people.
[01:25:50.225 --> 01:25:52.447]  The world is changing far too fast.
[01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:56.770]  Nothing like this has ever happened to Homo sapiens before.
[01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:00.753]  These ideas are gonna ultimately change the world.
[01:26:00.773 --> 01:26:02.113]  We didn't stay on the ground.
[01:26:02.173 --> 01:26:03.614]  We didn't stay on the planet.
[01:26:03.635 --> 01:26:06.476]  We didn't stay with the limitations of our biology.
[01:26:06.817 --> 01:26:10.619]  I think Ray is performing the service of God's prophet.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:12.661]  That's wrong.
[01:26:14.384 --> 01:26:19.286]  He has used the gift that he was given.
[01:26:19.366 --> 01:26:20.247]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:26:21.787 --> 01:26:24.328]  And they go on to say he's revealing our destiny.
[01:26:24.408 --> 01:26:25.409]  He did all of this.
[01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:31.392]  Ladies and gentlemen, over 150 years ago, British scientists wrote out this entire plan.
[01:26:31.852 --> 01:26:33.272]  Galton and others.
[01:26:33.312 --> 01:26:34.393]  You can go follow it.
[01:26:34.453 --> 01:26:35.373]  It's an endgame.
[01:26:35.894 --> 01:26:37.614]  Right through the founding of the UN.
[01:26:38.255 --> 01:26:41.056]  A global mop-up system to set up a global tyranny.
[01:26:41.556 --> 01:26:42.857]  Cut off the resources.
[01:26:43.817 --> 01:26:46.679]  They wrote about carbon taxes a hundred years ago.
[01:26:46.979 --> 01:26:49.241]  They've had this whole thing planned, and you've got to give it to them.
[01:26:49.541 --> 01:26:54.544]  They have been planned, they have been focused, they've got their guru, their little front man out there.
[01:26:55.024 --> 01:26:57.866]  Notice he says 40 years in this film.
[01:26:58.487 --> 01:27:02.649]  In his books, and what he really says is that this has basically already happened to some degree.
[01:27:02.969 --> 01:27:05.891]  He talks about there will be a total world government, how great it's going to be by 2020.
[01:27:06.952 --> 01:27:18.438]  He says the computers will see us as a mosquito and will swat us and that once they merge with the computers that they're going to swat us and it won't even matter because they're going to be gods compared to us.
[01:27:18.778 --> 01:27:20.980]  I mean, you ought to hear what they really are saying.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.761]  But you watch this and it's how cute it is.
[01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:24.862]  It's how funny it is.
[01:27:25.382 --> 01:27:26.543]  It's how sweet it is.
[01:27:28.003 --> 01:27:30.145]  And I'm going to cover this more tomorrow and throughout the week.
[01:27:30.165 --> 01:27:32.346]  And I'm going to come back from break and play a few more of these clips.
[01:27:33.566 --> 01:27:35.868]  But in my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:43.663]  I have all their countless quotes about, once the world government's in place, they gotta get rid of most of us, because we can't have access to this.
[01:27:44.023 --> 01:27:45.104]  What's the best way to do it?
[01:27:45.284 --> 01:27:46.445]  Is it airborne Ebola?
[01:27:46.945 --> 01:27:48.846]  Or is it airborne human mousepox?
[01:27:49.286 --> 01:27:50.727]  With a 99% kill rate.
[01:27:51.127 --> 01:27:52.508]  How do they get the bunkers built?
[01:27:52.908 --> 01:27:55.249]  How do they get the underground bases with the seeds built?
[01:27:56.465 --> 01:28:00.386]  I mean, I cover all this before they built the underground bunkers with the seeds.
[01:28:00.427 --> 01:28:01.187]  They've now done that.
[01:28:01.407 --> 01:28:01.967]  Who funded it?
[01:28:02.227 --> 01:28:03.328]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:28:03.768 --> 01:28:05.108]  Who funds Ray Kurzweil?
[01:28:05.128 --> 01:28:12.171]  And I got Aaron coming here in the last segment today with just a snapshot, because he went to Bilderberg and covered it in Switzerland, and that was on the agenda.
[01:28:13.257 --> 01:28:14.478]  That's what these people are into.
[01:28:14.858 --> 01:28:15.678]  That's what they're doing.
[01:28:15.698 --> 01:28:16.739]  That's all they talk about.
[01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:17.279]  Well, of course!
[01:28:17.819 --> 01:28:22.802]  They're people that control trillions of dollars, worth hundreds of billions apiece in some cases, most of their wealth hidden.
[01:28:23.322 --> 01:28:24.383]  What would you be into?
[01:28:25.103 --> 01:28:28.845]  If you were worth hundreds of billions of dollars, you'd be into life extension.
[01:28:30.046 --> 01:28:33.408]  But then they sit around arguing, saying, we can't give this to the public.
[01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:41.212]  And so in Endgame, I cover that that's what they're after, because that's what they say in all their literature.
[01:28:42.341 --> 01:28:46.664]  Not the popular books they sell to the sheep that say, oh, you'll be part of this.
[01:28:46.984 --> 01:28:48.065]  It's 40 years away.
[01:28:48.125 --> 01:28:48.886]  You've got time.
[01:28:48.926 --> 01:28:49.486]  Don't worry.
[01:28:50.927 --> 01:28:53.950]  How everything's going to be automated, remote controlled, your car, your house.
[01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:55.951]  They're already legalized in Nevada.
[01:28:56.011 --> 01:28:57.472]  Google cars without drivers.
[01:28:57.752 --> 01:28:59.614]  Next, it'll be you won't be allowed to drive your own car.
[01:29:02.219 --> 01:29:03.701]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:03.921 --> 01:29:08.947]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:29:09.227 --> 01:29:10.589]  Saving means to make money.
[01:29:10.769 --> 01:29:19.559]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:27.384]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:29:27.824 --> 01:29:35.428]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:29:35.828 --> 01:29:40.750]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:29:41.051 --> 01:29:43.212]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:29:45.993 --> 01:29:48.917]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:29:49.198 --> 01:29:51.521]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:29:52.202 --> 01:29:57.129]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:04.985]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.305 --> 01:30:05.905]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.226 --> 01:30:09.368]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.648 --> 01:30:10.208]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.509 --> 01:30:15.052]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.392 --> 01:30:15.832]  It's true.
[01:30:16.132 --> 01:30:20.695]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.016 --> 01:30:21.556]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.836 --> 01:30:25.118]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.418 --> 01:30:29.121]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.321 --> 01:30:29.882]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.122 --> 01:30:32.484]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.884 --> 01:30:36.267]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.567 --> 01:30:36.768]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.348 --> 01:30:41.271]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.512 --> 01:30:46.256]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.536 --> 01:30:50.583]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.723 --> 01:30:52.286]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.506 --> 01:30:54.590]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:57.114]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:31:01.914 --> 01:31:10.424]  The folks at eFoodsDirect have saved you from the huge price increases on food by buying raw materials ahead and packing your supplies themselves.
[01:31:10.904 --> 01:31:14.989]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:20.556]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.
[01:31:21.216 --> 01:31:29.224]  As of July 1st, Ifu's Direct is forced to increase their prices so they can still ship you the best storable food on the planet.
[01:31:29.544 --> 01:31:34.990]  Until the end of June, you can lock in the cost of your food at last year's prices by calling 800-409-5633.

[01:32:02.366 --> 01:32:06.007]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.327 --> 01:32:14.449]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:19.230]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:30.632]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:31.272 --> 01:32:40.274]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.774 --> 01:32:45.835]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:46.216 --> 01:32:53.377]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.697 --> 01:32:56.098]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.865]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.587 --> 01:33:08.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:26.752 --> 01:33:31.735]  The global social engineers know that humans are toolmakers.
[01:33:32.336 --> 01:33:33.637]  They've studied the species.
[01:33:34.257 --> 01:33:38.660]  They see themselves as a predator class with the right to rule over us, to kill us at will.
[01:33:40.301 --> 01:33:48.107]  Their program has always been to deploy a low-grade version of technologies that have been developed and that they've bought and financed.
[01:33:49.195 --> 01:33:56.739]  To be Trojan horses, any tool they give us has a built-in control system into it.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.841]  I told you about this a decade ago.
[01:33:58.881 --> 01:34:02.423]  Folks laugh, self-driving robot cars about to hit Nevada highways.
[01:34:02.463 --> 01:34:03.363]  They've passed a law.
[01:34:04.084 --> 01:34:05.825]  Soon there won't be any truck drivers anymore.
[01:34:06.705 --> 01:34:08.306]  There won't be any checkout lanes anymore.
[01:34:08.686 --> 01:34:10.447]  Why the future doesn't need us?
[01:34:11.748 --> 01:34:14.870]  Then, as they shut the economy off, you go on to welfare.
[01:34:16.035 --> 01:34:18.897]  Because they'll have huge robotic food production systems.
[01:34:18.937 --> 01:34:20.098]  This is what they say they're going to do.
[01:34:20.758 --> 01:34:21.679]  You'll be beholden.
[01:34:21.899 --> 01:34:26.322]  Well, now you're beholden to the computerized technocracy.
[01:34:26.722 --> 01:34:28.664]  The Air Force will go entirely drone.
[01:34:28.784 --> 01:34:31.065]  The Army will go almost entirely robot.
[01:34:31.406 --> 01:34:35.448]  It'll be humans that serve as some of the robots, but they will be replaced with robots.
[01:34:35.789 --> 01:34:37.390]  This is the plan, and it's coming.
[01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.830]  And we're building it.
[01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:50.973]  It's a more futuristic example of folks I know here in town at IBM, seven, eight years ago, who trained all their replacements from India, and knew they were going to be let go in six months when they trained them.
[01:34:52.234 --> 01:34:57.235]  They pay for the college, you know, they're in debt, they train their replacements.
[01:34:57.555 --> 01:35:00.116]  You're training your replacements, and then the technocrats
[01:35:01.198 --> 01:35:02.778]  They're designing the infrastructure.
[01:35:03.339 --> 01:35:04.499]  They're designing the system.
[01:35:04.859 --> 01:35:09.140]  They're designing all of it, not to empower humanity and build up humanity.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:13.761]  The vaccines, the GMO, reduced fertility, dumb you down, the fluoride.
[01:35:14.061 --> 01:35:15.161]  I saw a study on fluoride.
[01:35:15.502 --> 01:35:18.422]  There's only three places that have it almost everywhere.
[01:35:18.742 --> 01:35:22.203]  The US, Ireland, and the Basque area of Spain.
[01:35:22.443 --> 01:35:24.884]  All rebel areas to a nearby empire.
[01:35:25.444 --> 01:35:26.705]  Then you look at who financed it.
[01:35:27.065 --> 01:35:28.507]  Big eugenics foundations.
[01:35:28.687 --> 01:35:29.768]  Destroys fertility.
[01:35:30.268 --> 01:35:31.570]  Increases bone cancer.
[01:35:31.690 --> 01:35:32.891]  Increases birth defects.
[01:35:34.915 --> 01:35:35.316]  100% deadly.
[01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.817]  And it's all in areas where people rebel.
[01:35:38.397 --> 01:35:40.959]  And then I have the government documents where they admit all of this.
[01:35:41.039 --> 01:35:41.499]  Remember that.
[01:35:41.739 --> 01:35:42.760]  This is not my opinion.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.941]  These are cold-blooded killers.
[01:35:44.341 --> 01:35:48.223]  But they have a nice little cute little front man who they're building up like Einstein.
[01:35:48.623 --> 01:35:49.344]  Oh, he's there.
[01:35:49.404 --> 01:35:50.344]  He's Ray Kurzweil.
[01:35:50.824 --> 01:35:52.205]  He wants to take care of you.
[01:35:52.245 --> 01:35:54.166]  And I got Aaron coming in here with a special report.
[01:35:54.607 --> 01:35:56.728]  But remember four years ago when I put out Endgame.
[01:35:58.356 --> 01:36:03.637]  And I put it out because a decade before that, I would cover their plan to live forever.
[01:36:03.837 --> 01:36:09.538]  That they want to kill all of us after their global police state's set up, and they use quotes like that.
[01:36:09.858 --> 01:36:12.099]  The White House, science, czar, all of them do.
[01:36:12.979 --> 01:36:14.919]  A global police state and then we'll be exterminated.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:17.760]  And then they'll live forever.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.040]  Whether that's true or not, these people are nuts.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.040]  And I don't like that.
[01:36:22.381 --> 01:36:24.261]  I want to be involved in my destiny.
[01:36:25.086 --> 01:36:27.727]  And so the entire infrastructure of technology is good.
[01:36:27.747 --> 01:36:29.068]  It's like a gun.
[01:36:29.128 --> 01:36:29.908]  It's double-edged.
[01:36:29.968 --> 01:36:30.828]  It's how it's used.
[01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:34.530]  And they're just saying it's a foregone conclusion.
[01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:35.330]  This is the way it is.
[01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:36.450]  This is your destiny.
[01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:37.631]  Ray Kurzweil says so.
[01:36:38.831 --> 01:36:41.873]  Not telling you that it's all been financed for over 150 years.
[01:36:42.073 --> 01:36:43.133]  And I cover that in Endgame.
[01:36:43.193 --> 01:36:44.173]  Folks, Endgame, Endgame.
[01:36:44.374 --> 01:36:45.374]  It's free on YouTube.
[01:36:45.974 --> 01:36:47.055]  It's free, free.
[01:36:47.095 --> 01:36:49.996]  It's only had 10 million views between Google, YouTube, and other channels.
[01:36:50.416 --> 01:36:52.737]  It needs 35 mil like Obama deception.
[01:36:53.513 --> 01:36:55.135]  I don't even have ads on the stinking thing.
[01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:56.477]  It's just there for free.
[01:36:56.697 --> 01:36:57.538]  Get the DVD.
[01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:58.219]  Make copies.
[01:36:58.279 --> 01:36:59.180]  Show it to everybody you know.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:36:59.901]  Support us.
[01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:01.082]  Infowars.com.
[01:37:02.024 --> 01:37:08.111]  It's a million times more important because it's not deceptive like the Kurzweil movie that's coming out, hyping this to everyone.
[01:37:08.371 --> 01:37:11.856]  Let me tell you, the PhDs and people that are inside, they know it's not cute.
[01:37:12.276 --> 01:37:17.877]  They're being told what it really... Bill Joy, head of Sun Microsystems, 10 years ago wrote an article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[01:37:18.237 --> 01:37:22.238]  He said, I go to top conferences with 200 computer company owners, billionaires.
[01:37:22.678 --> 01:37:24.519]  All they talk about is, do we kill everybody?
[01:37:24.879 --> 01:37:26.319]  Do we give the public what we got?
[01:37:27.299 --> 01:37:29.440]  He had a pang of guilt.
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.261]  And so people would laugh at me about this, so I made the film.
[01:37:33.461 --> 01:37:34.381]  Here's London Guardian.
[01:37:35.279 --> 01:37:42.223]  An American inventor, who plans to live forever, has been appointed the head of the New School of Futurologists, backed by Google and the U.S.
[01:37:42.243 --> 01:37:43.384]  Space Agency, NASA.
[01:37:44.345 --> 01:37:46.206]  Google was created by DARPA.
[01:37:46.566 --> 01:37:51.989]  DARPA was created by designs from the 1950s, I just got chills, 50s and 60s.
[01:37:52.529 --> 01:37:53.770]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:37:54.391 --> 01:37:57.012]  The technology is way more advanced than we're even told.
[01:37:57.653 --> 01:37:58.913]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[01:37:59.614 --> 01:38:00.935]  They've already got life extension.
[01:38:01.837 --> 01:38:03.438]  They're already having to stage their deaths.
[01:38:04.018 --> 01:38:07.119]  The MO is the Queen Mother is not sitting in a crypt, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:07.379 --> 01:38:08.019]  I'm telling you!
[01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:10.420]  I'm telling you this is what it's all about!
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.461]  Now, let me go ahead for you.
[01:38:14.461 --> 01:38:15.562]  Let me go ahead now for you.
[01:38:15.582 --> 01:38:16.562]  They don't want to stage their deaths.
[01:38:16.582 --> 01:38:17.882]  They want to be out in the open with this stuff.
[01:38:18.063 --> 01:38:19.383]  But we can't be here for that to happen.
[01:38:19.583 --> 01:38:21.064]  Because you think folks riot over food?
[01:38:21.564 --> 01:38:23.444]  They're going to riot and say, you keep my mother alive.
[01:38:23.704 --> 01:38:24.685]  You got technologies.
[01:38:25.385 --> 01:38:27.206]  Instead, they kill your mother with chemotherapy.
[01:38:27.606 --> 01:38:30.687]  Here is the trailer from four years ago for Endgame.
[01:38:31.601 --> 01:38:33.542]  Breaking down what they're now admitting to you.
[01:38:33.762 --> 01:38:34.202]  Here it is.
[01:38:35.162 --> 01:38:36.622]  It is a big idea.
[01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:38.763]  A new world order.
[01:38:43.104 --> 01:38:49.626]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:38:49.666 --> 01:38:52.146]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:38:52.186 --> 01:38:54.367]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:38:56.621 --> 01:38:59.103]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:38:59.963 --> 01:39:07.468]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:39:14.112 --> 01:39:19.175]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:39:20.996 --> 01:39:24.358]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:28.267]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:39:28.628 --> 01:39:34.111]  And only an educated and informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[01:39:35.391 --> 01:39:38.513]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[01:39:39.134 --> 01:39:42.475]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[01:39:43.636 --> 01:39:47.138]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain of youth.
[01:39:47.959 --> 01:39:52.121]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[01:39:53.723 --> 01:39:59.789]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[01:40:05.155 --> 01:40:07.417]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[01:40:07.437 --> 01:40:09.800]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:11.542]  Most people have no idea.
[01:40:11.562 --> 01:40:12.343]  They're not after money.
[01:40:12.363 --> 01:40:13.484]  They have all the money they need.
[01:40:13.704 --> 01:40:14.465]  They're after power.
[01:40:15.426 --> 01:40:16.287]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:20.431]  I was pulled off a plane in Munich.
[01:40:20.451 --> 01:40:21.632]  They interrogated me for four hours.
[01:40:21.732 --> 01:40:22.733]  Some shots were fired.
[01:40:22.753 --> 01:40:24.033]  I need you to move off the problem.
[01:40:25.094 --> 01:40:29.657]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:33.980]  Endgame.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.002]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:40:36.402 --> 01:40:37.623]  You have been warned.
[01:40:39.537 --> 01:40:41.798]  Only 10 million people have seen the film.
[01:40:41.818 --> 01:40:44.860]  I'm going to take you out to break with only part of this.
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:46.801]  British government funded.
[01:40:47.161 --> 01:40:51.704]  This is shown to school children and to people in England and Europe before movie theaters.
[01:40:52.164 --> 01:40:53.545]  It's called Plandopolis.
[01:40:54.445 --> 01:41:01.507]  And you think it's a joke about total planned society, can't move, only get meat once a year, one-child policies.
[01:41:01.907 --> 01:41:09.509]  They're throwing it in your face like it's normal, like TSA sticking their hands down your pants, to just condition you that outrageous things are normal.
[01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.670]  Okay?
[01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:16.351]  We're going to go out to break without music with as much of Plandopolis as we can play.
[01:41:16.792 --> 01:41:20.733]  If not, just put into the NSA search engine Google, Plandopolis, and you'll get it.
[01:41:20.773 --> 01:41:21.113]  Here it is.
[01:41:23.339 --> 01:41:26.361]  Welcome to a little fairy tale about the joys of living in an eco-tyranny.
[01:41:29.002 --> 01:41:31.223]  How will people travel in the cities of the future?
[01:41:31.644 --> 01:41:32.844]  MegaCities on the move.
[01:41:33.124 --> 01:41:35.886]  Your guide to the future of sustainable urban mobility.
[01:41:37.571 --> 01:41:40.633]  Plandopolis, one of our four possible scenarios.
[01:41:41.033 --> 01:41:49.918]  In a world of fossil fuels and expensive energy, the only solution is tightly planned urban transport under the global government energy planning system.
[01:41:50.419 --> 01:41:52.380]  Global climate change deal imminent.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.141]  Joint venture to redesign city.
[01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.622]  Plans for new floating cities approved.
[01:41:57.483 --> 01:41:58.483]  Where have we heard of this before?
[01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:01.765]  Oh, there's the Global Food Council.
[01:42:02.546 --> 01:42:03.907]  Oh, welcome to the Plandopolis.
[01:42:04.947 --> 01:42:05.988]  Let's cut to one of their minions.
[01:42:09.946 --> 01:42:10.126]  Oh, hi!
[01:42:10.867 --> 01:42:12.708]  I'm so glad you're on time.
[01:42:12.728 --> 01:42:17.032]  I'm V. I'm looking forward to showing you around Plandopolis today.
[01:42:17.052 --> 01:42:19.874]  My husband works from home.
[01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:23.877]  He's a virtual engineer working in one of the city's desalination plants.
[01:42:24.418 --> 01:42:26.840]  He controls the robots who do all the important maintenance.
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.982]  I think he basically plays computer games for a living.
[01:42:32.404 --> 01:42:33.024]  You ready to go?
[01:42:33.044 --> 01:42:35.725]  She bashed her husband, you notice.
[01:42:36.505 --> 01:42:39.025]  I registered your visit with Slick Travel Corp.
[01:42:39.065 --> 01:42:42.386]  the other day, so they've allotted you a journey time to match mine.
[01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:44.786]  It makes so much sense, doesn't it?
[01:42:45.366 --> 01:42:47.527]  Switch off brain and go to work.
[01:42:48.307 --> 01:42:51.808]  With this many people around, I'm glad there's a mega-computer in charge.
[01:42:53.348 --> 01:42:54.448]  We're so lucky.
[01:42:54.588 --> 01:42:58.369]  Our kids were allocated a school quite near my practice so I can drop them off on the way.
[01:42:58.389 --> 01:42:59.669]  We'll be right back!
[01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:05.954]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:06.354 --> 01:43:09.357]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:09.617 --> 01:43:14.381]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:43:14.401 --> 01:43:20.607]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:20.787 --> 01:43:23.030]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.850]  Tim Geithner?
[01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:24.290]  Bernanke?
[01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:25.011]  They're arsonists!
[01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:26.311]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:28.572]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:44.299]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:43:44.599 --> 01:43:49.400]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:58.923]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:00.919 --> 01:44:05.141]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:05.461 --> 01:44:06.062]  Number 1.
[01:44:06.382 --> 01:44:09.524]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:09.804 --> 01:44:10.364]  Number 2.
[01:44:10.664 --> 01:44:15.207]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:44:15.547 --> 01:44:16.007]  It's true.
[01:44:16.287 --> 01:44:20.850]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:21.710]  Number 3.
[01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:25.272]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:25.572 --> 01:44:29.274]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:29.474 --> 01:44:30.035]  Number 4.
[01:44:30.275 --> 01:44:32.637]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:33.037 --> 01:44:36.421]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:44:36.721 --> 01:44:36.941]  Number 5.
[01:44:37.522 --> 01:44:41.445]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:44:41.665 --> 01:44:46.430]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:45:11.124 --> 01:45:15.187]  They haven't increased their prices on great long-term food reserves since last year.
[01:45:15.587 --> 01:45:20.772]  With the rising cost of raw materials and gas prices, they can't hold off any longer.

[01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:05.802]  Tyranny is here.
[01:46:06.163 --> 01:46:10.067]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:46:10.087 --> 01:46:12.289]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:46:12.309 --> 01:46:17.755]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:46:18.195 --> 01:46:24.422]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:46:24.842 --> 01:46:30.404]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:46:30.785 --> 01:46:34.486]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:46:34.986 --> 01:46:38.968]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:46:39.288 --> 01:46:44.790]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:48.192]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:46:48.792 --> 01:46:50.232]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:46:50.753 --> 01:46:51.193]  It's here.

[01:47:02.024 --> 01:47:03.185]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:03.566 --> 01:47:04.867]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.608 --> 01:47:08.811]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:15.129 --> 01:47:21.414]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.695 --> 01:47:24.036]  All right, it's the final segment.
[01:47:24.056 --> 01:47:29.761]  We'll be back during the week, obviously, with other guest news and calls, but today was very important, so I've stayed focused on news.
[01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:32.843]  I'm probably going to have another demonstration at the Capitol.
[01:47:33.403 --> 01:47:36.446]  We're going to go inside and talk to our representatives tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[01:47:36.486 --> 01:47:38.007]  In fact, let's just say we're going to be there.
[01:47:38.027 --> 01:47:39.008]  I'll cover it more tomorrow.
[01:47:39.949 --> 01:47:40.229]  Pardon me?
[01:47:42.714 --> 01:47:45.116]  We'll have to move that TV interview, then we've already agreed to that.
[01:47:45.656 --> 01:47:47.157]  It'll give folks more time to get down there.
[01:47:47.197 --> 01:47:52.761]  Let's say 4 o'clock tomorrow at the Texas Capitol, then I can do the TV interview.
[01:47:53.042 --> 01:47:59.026]  We're gonna go down there where they're trying to kill the bill again, Republican dirty tricks with the Democrats to stop the groping.
[01:47:59.326 --> 01:48:00.087]  We're gonna do that tomorrow.
[01:48:00.467 --> 01:48:00.988]  Four o'clock.
[01:48:01.008 --> 01:48:03.552]  I want to see everybody down there at the Texas State Capitol.
[01:48:03.593 --> 01:48:05.356]  Go in and talk to our state reps.
[01:48:05.376 --> 01:48:09.543]  You can meet me out front at the south entrance, or you can just go on in, but I'll see you there at four.
[01:48:09.923 --> 01:48:10.825]  Spread the word, folks.
[01:48:11.506 --> 01:48:14.090]  Silicon Valley tycoon embraces sci-fi future.
[01:48:15.265 --> 01:48:19.268]  The man who made billions on Facebook and PayPal says it's time to invest looking forward.
[01:48:19.288 --> 01:48:19.769]  AP.
[01:48:20.129 --> 01:48:20.909]  He was at Bilderberg.
[01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:22.150]  FCC chief.
[01:48:22.671 --> 01:48:23.612]  And it goes on from there.
[01:48:24.112 --> 01:48:26.614]  Self-driving robot cars about to hit Nevada highways.
[01:48:26.654 --> 01:48:27.455]  See, it's all happening.
[01:48:28.295 --> 01:48:30.697]  Google wants to control and run your house.
[01:48:32.478 --> 01:48:33.119]  It goes on and on.
[01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:36.321]  Terrorist pre-crime detector field-tested in the United States.
[01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:40.365]  They're going to have mobile trucks where they claim you're a terrorist because the computer said so.
[01:48:41.049 --> 01:48:41.909]  It's all made up.
[01:48:42.329 --> 01:48:46.711]  You discredit the lie detector that came out with fancier blinking light garbage.
[01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:47.871]  It's all quackery.
[01:48:48.631 --> 01:48:52.733]  Now, Aaron, you've been here almost six years.
[01:48:52.813 --> 01:48:56.634]  You know, you got a degree in international relations or whatever from UT.
[01:48:56.934 --> 01:48:58.054]  You've studied all this stuff.
[01:48:58.074 --> 01:49:00.515]  When you first got here, you've learned more and more.
[01:49:01.115 --> 01:49:09.518]  Am I exaggerating in any way or is it the opposite that these people are a cult that think they're going to become God and that they want to exterminate the majority of us?
[01:49:10.037 --> 01:49:22.927]  No, they're absolutely obsessed with controlling the population from a statistical point of view, from an authoritarian centralized government point of view, and they want to centralize all the mechanisms of our society, even those that are outside of government.
[01:49:23.107 --> 01:49:29.072]  We've only got eight minutes now, we'll do bigger reports this week, but more and more I'm going to focus on this because they're rolling it out now publicly.
[01:49:29.372 --> 01:49:33.656]  Break down just from the Bilderberg angle the latest, and this is what they're obsessed with.
[01:49:34.690 --> 01:49:39.633]  Yeah, well, we're talking about Peter Thiel, who's known as one of the PayPal mafia entrepreneurs.
[01:49:40.074 --> 01:49:48.339]  He's a derivatives trader, former derivatives trader, and hedge fund manager, and he was the co-founding CEO of PayPal.
[01:49:48.379 --> 01:49:50.241]  He then sold that to eBay for billions.
[01:49:50.661 --> 01:49:54.544]  He was one of the earliest and biggest outside investors of Facebook.
[01:49:54.584 --> 01:49:57.025]  In fact, he was the first outside investor of Facebook.
[01:49:57.045 --> 01:50:00.708]  He's made billions there and on dozens and dozens of other high-tech
[01:50:00.708 --> 01:50:03.029]  And they're not engaged in just a takeover of stock markets.
[01:50:03.049 --> 01:50:04.830]  This is a takeover of the human species.
[01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:05.810]  Right.
[01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:12.674]  I mean, you can see on the Bilderberg list where they're directing just the things that are happening online and the social and retail avenues.
[01:50:13.034 --> 01:50:21.378]  But he's also highly funded in futures technology and life extension technology and space commercialization.
[01:50:21.418 --> 01:50:22.498]  As they all are, though.
[01:50:22.538 --> 01:50:23.679]  This is all they do.
[01:50:24.602 --> 01:50:26.262]  Yeah, I mean, just a few things about him.
[01:50:26.302 --> 01:50:28.623]  He's heavily into surveillance technology.
[01:50:29.083 --> 01:50:41.866]  In 2004, Peter Thiel co-founded Palantir Technologies, which offers platforms for finance companies and intelligence, defense, and law enforcement communities to integrate, visualize, and analyze the world's information.
[01:50:42.286 --> 01:50:44.347]  And that's one of the biggest Facebook founders.
[01:50:44.367 --> 01:50:45.227]  Total spying!
[01:50:45.347 --> 01:50:46.747]  He's funded LinkedIn.
[01:50:46.807 --> 01:50:47.867]  He's funded PayPal.
[01:50:47.887 --> 01:50:50.208]  They have all the online data between those companies.
[01:50:51.048 --> 01:50:56.533]  And, uh, just check out all the high-tech people who attended Bilderberg just this year, in 2011.
[01:50:57.033 --> 01:51:00.356]  First of all, there's Keith Alexander, the head of cyber- U.S.
[01:51:00.376 --> 01:51:00.877]  Cyber Command.
[01:51:00.897 --> 01:51:01.777]  The head of NSA.
[01:51:02.278 --> 01:51:07.362]  Yeah, he called for bigger war, and was like, that damn Kucinich, you know, keeps getting things held up.
[01:51:07.803 --> 01:51:12.787]  You also had Bill Gates, or the Bill and Melinda Gates, and of course- Total eugenicist, forced inoculations.
[01:51:12.827 --> 01:51:12.927]  Yes.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:31.842]  One arm of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:51:32.182 --> 01:51:35.144]  You also had Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com there.
[01:51:35.505 --> 01:51:38.187]  The LinkedIn chairman and co-founder, Reid Hoffman.
[01:51:38.567 --> 01:51:40.769]  Chris R. Hughes, the co-founder of Facebook.
[01:51:40.789 --> 01:51:42.850]  Remember the Financial Times of London two years ago?
[01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:46.253]  Worlds rich meet secretly to discuss reducing population.
[01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:47.554]  Financial Times of London.
[01:51:47.574 --> 01:51:48.214]  Let's put that up.
[01:51:48.414 --> 01:51:48.895]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:49.727 --> 01:51:52.949]  No, it's all tied in to a point of real scariness.
[01:51:52.989 --> 01:52:00.714]  I mean, as you pointed out earlier, they used the Holorith experiment, and the Nazi Germany stuff, and uh, what was the name of the Jamaican experiment?
[01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:02.455]  The point is- Race Mixing Study.
[01:52:02.795 --> 01:52:10.220]  But the issue is, is that they always have the little public statement of why they're doing this, but then Gates gets up at these public TEDs,
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:11.500]  I don't think so.
[01:52:30.407 --> 01:52:33.189]  Yeah, the movie's obscure, but you've talked about it here on air before.
[01:52:33.249 --> 01:52:42.073]  Zardoz is all about how to make the node of centralized controllers live forever and exterminate the population on Earth, the normal people.
[01:52:42.413 --> 01:52:44.975]  It's a whole Wizard of Oz system, you know, the man behind the curtain.
[01:52:44.995 --> 01:52:45.915]  That's who these people are.
[01:52:45.975 --> 01:52:46.916]  They control everything.
[01:52:47.336 --> 01:52:47.916]  We're good to go.
[01:53:06.286 --> 01:53:11.229]  Yeah, and that all ties in directly with the things Bill Gates funds, and so they all work together.
[01:53:11.249 --> 01:53:12.110]  They're part of the steering committee.
[01:53:12.130 --> 01:53:13.691]  So life for them, death for us.
[01:53:13.711 --> 01:53:20.795]  And they're teaching us through the fake environmental movement that we're all scum and need to die, while they, the enlightened ones, get to go forward.
[01:53:21.455 --> 01:53:22.196]  Yeah, and there you are.
[01:53:22.216 --> 01:53:23.456]  Well, what would ultra-rich do?
[01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:24.317]  This is a no-brainer.
[01:53:24.337 --> 01:53:25.658]  Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:53:25.678 --> 01:53:27.959]  I mean, Endgame that you made five, six years ago in 2006,
[01:53:29.639 --> 01:53:31.800]  Well, we're making it in six, but it's actually four, yeah.
[01:53:32.341 --> 01:53:33.402]  Okay, yeah, off on the ears.
[01:53:33.442 --> 01:53:41.447]  But the point is, you draw in all the Life Extension stuff and the Kurzweil connections then, and now it's more directly connected to Bilderberg.
[01:53:41.467 --> 01:53:49.853]  You got Eric Schmidt, Bill Gates, and Peter Thiel becoming the most centralized steering committee members of the Bilderberg group for all the high-tech stuff.
[01:53:50.273 --> 01:53:51.233]  And those are young guys.
[01:53:51.253 --> 01:53:52.434]  The other guys are fading out.
[01:53:52.834 --> 01:53:56.017]  Yeah, the Queen of England, the Queen of the Netherlands, and others, they've taken a back seat.
[01:53:56.397 --> 01:53:59.299]  And it is the technocratic NSA people that run it all.
[01:53:59.939 --> 01:54:05.381]  Yeah, and the other thing is obviously David Rockefeller isn't going to live forever unless they achieve these bizarre goals.
[01:54:06.182 --> 01:54:16.646]  Jay Rockefeller, the senator, he's, Tucker identified it just as we did along, you know, six months ago at least, if not several years ago, that he's basically the next head of the Rockefeller family.
[01:54:16.986 --> 01:54:18.987]  And here he says we should have never invented the internet.
[01:54:19.007 --> 01:54:19.827]  We have to control it.
[01:54:19.847 --> 01:54:23.248]  There's going to be these cyber attacks and that has been on the Bilderberg agenda.
[01:54:23.268 --> 01:54:25.850]  And then right as they try to pass them, the cyber attacks get launched.
[01:54:26.710 --> 01:54:26.870]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:29.571]  But you've read, how many other books have you read?
[01:54:29.611 --> 01:54:30.952]  I mean, it's just, it's constant.
[01:54:31.373 --> 01:54:39.079]  And what about my statement that the ideas that have charted our entire modern scientific lexicon all came out of eugenics?
[01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:41.211]  It absolutely did, Alex.
[01:54:41.271 --> 01:54:44.594]  I mean, look at the industrialists who founded those organizations.
[01:54:45.195 --> 01:54:53.483]  It's Rockefeller... The folks that discovered the genome were doing it for trying to achieve eternal life and to wipe out the subhumans.
[01:54:54.243 --> 01:54:55.745]  This book right here is a great example.
[01:54:55.785 --> 01:54:59.088]  The Molecular Vision of Life, Caltech and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:55:00.731 --> 01:55:02.372]  Yeah, show folks on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:02.612 --> 01:55:03.293]  Tell them about that.
[01:55:03.513 --> 01:55:09.376]  That was a book recommended by Dr. Russell Blaylock, who knows so much about eugenics and isn't afraid to talk about it.
[01:55:09.776 --> 01:55:17.241]  And it really shows how the Rockefeller Foundation and a few other important people, the point is they steered and controlled the research and development.
[01:55:17.281 --> 01:55:18.582]  They steered and controlled the genetics.
[01:55:18.602 --> 01:55:23.925]  Well, they found out that most cancer is viral in the 20s, and then by the 30s, we're putting it in the vaccines.
[01:55:24.205 --> 01:55:27.787]  Then they own most of the major cancer research facilities.
[01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.610]  They get first dibs on it and they learn how to control the virus.
[01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:34.054]  They inject you with the cancer and we even have their research papers where they talk about it.
[01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:38.659]  And they also yield from the good science that does allow them to extend their lives to a certain extent.
[01:55:39.179 --> 01:55:42.543]  But what you have in the United States... They've killed most of the people that have died in America.
[01:55:42.583 --> 01:55:44.845]  They've created Hitler.
[01:55:45.046 --> 01:55:49.510]  It's on record the Rockefellers funded Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm race facility.
[01:55:50.313 --> 01:55:58.581]  We're talking about the bastards who took control of the Industrial Revolution and created total monopolies for the first time in America, and they aren't going to give it up.
[01:55:58.621 --> 01:56:02.946]  They decided instead to liquidate their competition and decrease the population.
[01:56:02.986 --> 01:56:04.948]  They decided that 120 years ago or something.
[01:56:06.569 --> 01:56:08.271]  And they've since steered all the science.
[01:56:08.291 --> 01:56:09.272]  And you've got eugenics.
[01:56:09.672 --> 01:56:12.214]  They hit a little too hard in the early 10s and 20s.
[01:56:12.254 --> 01:56:13.335]  They went too hard.
[01:56:13.735 --> 01:56:15.857]  People realized it was radical, even by the mid 20s.
[01:56:15.937 --> 01:56:21.121]  And Julian Huxley, the head of the UN program, brother of Aldous Huxley, who in 32 wrote Brave New World.
[01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:22.842]  People read and go, it's all coming true.
[01:56:22.862 --> 01:56:26.065]  Before he died, he gave a speech at Berkeley and said, it's all real.
[01:56:26.085 --> 01:56:27.546]  We've already got chips in people's brains.
[01:56:27.826 --> 01:56:30.068]  His brother said, Hitler made us look bad.
[01:56:30.088 --> 01:56:31.910]  We're going to call ourselves transhumanist.
[01:56:32.372 --> 01:56:46.799]  Yeah, but they identified that exact same reaction to the eugenics thing in the early 20s before Hitler got out of control and started steering the molecular science as a way to biochemically control people, specifically to control the population.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:47.800]  This book is incredible.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.181]  I don't have time to pull out the quotes.
[01:56:49.921 --> 01:56:58.828]  And as Dr. Begich points out, for every chemical attack they're running on us through food and water, they've got at least 20 times the electromagnetic manipulation.
[01:56:59.329 --> 01:57:04.012]  And now through the smart meters, the new light bulbs, which they admit that they're going to send pulses through.
[01:57:04.593 --> 01:57:06.114]  You think the TV flicker gets you, folks?
[01:57:06.134 --> 01:57:06.734]  This is nothing.
[01:57:07.015 --> 01:57:09.337]  And it will, quote, even overtake and control your computers.
[01:57:09.697 --> 01:57:17.203]  The new computers coming out have an infrared sensor that's then controlled by the new light bulbs, and they have data over the power couplers.
[01:57:18.308 --> 01:57:21.891]  I mean, it's incredible what we're seeing, the revolutions in science and technology.
[01:57:22.271 --> 01:57:31.959]  The scary thing is that these guys are literally on the Bilderberg Steering Committee deciding who controls that data, sharing it with all the law enforcement and integrated systems.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.082]  They decide which direction this futurist technology is going to go.
[01:57:35.643 --> 01:57:36.885]  They're charting human destiny.
[01:57:37.125 --> 01:57:39.008]  We should have a real debate about human destiny.
[01:57:39.248 --> 01:57:41.211]  We'll be having it at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:41.451 --> 01:57:42.853]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:57:43.134 --> 01:57:45.738]  This is the most important information in the world that could be covered.
[01:57:45.938 --> 01:57:46.619]  Great job, Aaron.
[01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:47.300]  Great job, Cruz.
