[00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:09.640]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:11.101]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:12.782]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:17.005]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:21.708]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.983]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Wednesday, October 19, 2011 transmission.
[00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:43.367]  I'm Aaron Dyke, sitting in for Alex Jones, but he will join us in the next segment.
[00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:51.292]  Also coming up on the program, Paul Joseph Watson to discuss his article, State Department Agitator Advising Occupy Movement.
[00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:57.117]  Someone who helped lead the Egypt-Arab Spring, which has now spiraled out into dictatorship.
[00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:05.965]  Uh, we will also be speaking with Webster Tarpley, an expert on foreign policy and all the rest of it, as well as Alan Watt.
[00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:08.227]  That's all coming up later in the program.
[00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:12.151]  Lots of economic news, including holy bailout.
[00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:14.614]  Federal Reserve now backstopping 75 trillion
[00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:44.599]  Trillion with a T of Bank of America's derivatives trades they were allowed to put them in a investment arm that is protected by the FDIC Which would force the FDIC to protect those derivative investments should the bank fail also exposing them to the Fed discount window and apparently JP Morgan has also got about 79 trillion with a T of derivatives protected by the FDIC and Federal Reserve and
[00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:46.000]  That is still developing.
[00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.204]  US hawks behind Iraq war rally for strikes against Iran.
[00:01:50.244 --> 00:02:02.877]  That's from Global Research reporting on how William Crystal and other neocons who helped bring about the Iraq war in 2003 are pressuring Obama to strike Iran after the phony fake plot.
[00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:04.038]  We're good to go.
[00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:28.579]  They are being pressured out.
[00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:40.103]  According to an email sent to Infowars.com, Brookfield Properties recently posted an ad on New York Craigslist calling for able-bodied men to evict the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators from Zuccotti Park on Friday.
[00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:46.365]  Brookfield Properties is the company that owns Zuccotti Park where the Occupy Wall Street is encamped in Manhattan.
[00:02:46.886 --> 00:02:50.607]  And they'll arrest you even for trying to close down bank accounts as we've seen in videos.
[00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:55.249]  We also have the new Stuxnet worm targeting companies in Europe
[00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.511]  The son of Stuxnet says another article.
[00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.993]  Researchers warn of impending cyber attack.
[00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:07.837]  The US and Israel admittedly behind the Stuxnet worm that attacked Iran.
[00:03:07.857 --> 00:03:16.664]  And now experts suspect the Dooku worm is from the same source that targeted Iran's nuclear facilities, widely said to have been US and Israel.
[00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:26.321]  We also have the judge who ruled that no food rights exist, that you do not have an inherent right to produce or consume the foods of your choice.
[00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:31.884]  That judge from Wisconsin has now quit and is working for a Monsanto law firm.
[00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:32.525]  Go figure.
[00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:41.611]  That would be former judge Patrick J. Fielder, who now works for actually Brenelson LLP, who defended Monsanto against a patent infringement case.
[00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:57.058]  Also, the New York Times has sued the federal government for refusing to reveal its secret interpretation of the Patriot Act, even though it's public law, supposedly, that we're supposed to be serving under.
[00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:09.004]  The law is said to be classified, and the request to reveal the interpretation being used to kill American citizens overseas and all the rest of it will not be revealed, despite lawsuits.
[00:04:10.024 --> 00:04:14.947]  The family of Alaki's son hits out at the U.S.
[00:04:15.047 --> 00:04:23.193]  in fury over the fate of the son, the teenager killed in Yemen during the drone attack where his father was also killed.
[00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.387]  All that and more coming up in just a minute.
[00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:31.250]  Alex Jones on the other side to break down the latest news.
[00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:36.936]  Stay with us, there's plenty more on the program and we'll hit it on the other side of this break.
[00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:41.341]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com and tonight, the InfoWars Nightly News!
[00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:03.308]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:08.553]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.194]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:19.163]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:26.989]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.035]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:40.359]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.821]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:48.506]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.109]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.292]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:04.525]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:05.446]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:08.908]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:09.729]  Number 2.
[00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.593]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:15.373]  It's true.
[00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:20.237]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:21.077]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.378 --> 00:06:24.660]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:29.404]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.644 --> 00:06:32.026]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.407 --> 00:06:35.810]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:36.311]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:40.816]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:45.801]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:50.102]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:51.782]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:54.122]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:56.883]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:56.903 --> 00:07:06.004]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:12.026]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:13.866]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:27.555]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:33.487]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:37.328]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.869]  Others don't.
[00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:41.150]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.931]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.752]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:46.092 --> 00:07:52.335]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:54.916]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:57.457]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:58.278]  Others don't.
[00:08:05.612 --> 00:08:09.817]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.238]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:12.920]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:17.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:21.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:37.359]  Aaron Dykes back on this Wednesday InfoWars transmission now into the long segment and we are joined by Alex Jones right now.
[00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:45.285]  Of course we do have a jam-packed broadcast coming up with Paul Joseph Watson, Webster Tarpley, Alan Watt and a lot more news.
[00:08:45.505 --> 00:08:48.147]  Alex, what's most important on the radar today?
[00:08:49.582 --> 00:09:01.475]  I think you're going to have a lot of key analysis coming up with Paul Watson in about 25 minutes from Prison Planet breaking down the fact that known Marxist groups funded by the British and U.S.
[00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:05.280]  government are trying to implement the Cass Sunstein program to brainwash kids.
[00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.452]  And teach them to not trust any alternative media.
[00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:12.796]  The system is just absolutely panicking right now.
[00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:28.651]  Alan Watts, I can't wait today as I'm driving home to hear his analysis on Occupy Wall Street and this global move for the elite to trigger revolutions so they can artificially steer them before the real revolutions kick off on their own.
[00:09:29.462 --> 00:09:30.442]  It's all about timing.
[00:09:30.462 --> 00:09:32.443]  That's what the globalists are doing right now.
[00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:42.908]  And of course, Webster Griffin, Darby Lee, on the African, huge invasion of Africa, Chad, Ivory Coast, Uganda, all of it coming up.
[00:09:42.928 --> 00:09:45.949]  You can also get his take on Iran, occupy Wall Street, you name it.
[00:09:45.969 --> 00:09:49.051]  So a jam-packed transmission definitely today.
[00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:50.712]  And I tell you, I'm chomping at the bit.
[00:09:51.052 --> 00:09:53.813]  The crew knows I almost just decided to Skype in.
[00:09:55.091 --> 00:10:09.157]  From the road, as I drive down the road with the family, but I decided to not do that because you're there in the cockpit and you've got all these great informative minds joining the transmission today.
[00:10:09.217 --> 00:10:16.680]  But most important is that we go with our research, we go with our gut, we go with the facts.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.282]  I should have five, six weeks ago when Occupy Wall Street was being announced,
[00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:22.329]  I don't know.
[00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:54.471]  Like a, like a western painting behind John Wayne and stagecoach shot on the soundstage to say, look, you know, here are the people, here's what they want.
[00:10:54.851 --> 00:11:03.757]  Then the system can selectively talk to the people they want to, to create the perception that redistribute or else capitalism went wrong.
[00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:08.901]  We want all these new taxes, which will really just be used to pay austerity to the central banks.
[00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:10.742]  We told you these scams were coming.
[00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:14.965]  So this is about the establishment knowing we're really in a depression that they've engineered.
[00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:42.143]  And then trying to trigger the revolution before it organically developed, and to try to really kind of take over the end of the Fed movement, that of course has been going on now for decades, but under that name for four years, now we get to be lectured by the Occupy Wall Street people, and all the big Tides Foundation blogs, they're attacking myself, Ron Paul, and others right now, the service, employees, Corporation International,
[00:11:42.463 --> 00:11:43.284]  We're good to go.
[00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:14.001]  All of our listeners are noticing it and have become very sophisticated and notice it as soon as I threw the gauntlet down against the fellow reserve and tried to shift the activist groups onto the actual power structure that created this economic collapse.
[00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:19.984]  You know, the true criminal 1% who are waging war against what's left of the middle class and the working class.
[00:12:21.264 --> 00:12:23.985]  The gates of Hades have been released against us.
[00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:25.466]  That doesn't scare me.
[00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:29.328]  That lets me know we are heading directly at the heart of the system.
[00:12:30.143 --> 00:12:40.545]  The good news is they've not been able to co-opt the entire Occupy Wall Street movement, and instead a lot of their union-type people and others are actually waking up.
[00:12:40.585 --> 00:12:41.666]  I'm not against unions.
[00:12:42.006 --> 00:12:52.368]  I'm against how they've been taken over by globalists and don't oppose NAFTA and CAT and then promote gun control and police state and open borders, everything destroying American workers' jobs.
[00:12:53.214 --> 00:13:04.338]  So they want to play us off against each other, but just as the Republicans were unable to co-opt the Tea Party entirely, you now see Rick Perry and all of them with Tea Party talking points, we're actually co-opting them.
[00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:10.541]  A true populism in the vein of Thomas Jefferson is here upon us.
[00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:18.031]  But there is no doubt the elite's making their move worldwide through fake color revolution run by the State Department.
[00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:19.814]  And we'll watch some shots of that news coming up.
[00:13:19.874 --> 00:13:21.537]  I know you have it in front of you there.
[00:13:21.557 --> 00:13:23.740]  Aaron, you can give folks the headline in a moment.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.142]  But we already knew this.
[00:13:25.182 --> 00:13:26.244]  This came out a month ago.
[00:13:26.844 --> 00:13:36.006]  And then it's now been confirmed the State Department, the CIA, think tanks they use are on the ground all over the country, including Austin.
[00:13:36.326 --> 00:13:45.529]  These are the people that come up and say, don't have a Ron Paul sign, don't talk about the Federal Reserve, but then they allow the union stuff and the calls for redistribution of wealth to be there.
[00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:52.890]  They want to claim they don't have an agenda except redistribute wealth, but then that's actually so they can quietly organize and try to take control.
[00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:54.991]  The globalists have prematurely launched
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:11.264]  The revolution in this country to try to hijack it into a Marxist redistribution vein directed by the mega bankers, George Soros and of course Warren Buffett and others who are Rockefeller and Rothschild agents, now publicly casting it.
[00:14:11.524 --> 00:14:18.245]  And you've got the State Department operatives who are literally behind the overthrow in Egypt, which made it 10 times worse.
[00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:22.907]  Total banning of free speech, killing of women, kicking women out of college, just stoning.
[00:14:24.967 --> 00:14:29.308]  And again, Mubarak was a dictator, but he actually tried to build his people up a little bit.
[00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:31.308]  He was a U.S.-backed dictator.
[00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:35.089]  That said, he's gone, and now it's total evil.
[00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:48.232]  This is the model all over the world, all over Africa, everywhere now, with invasion forces going in and either attacking rebels trying to overthrow Western puppets, or having rebels triggered to overthrow people that
[00:14:49.654 --> 00:14:50.354]  I think so.
[00:15:06.131 --> 00:15:14.477]  In the exact details of this new Euro super state run by private banks where the countries have no sovereignty, I can't say no to the new taxes or regulations.
[00:15:14.857 --> 00:15:16.478]  We are seeing history being made.
[00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:19.620]  The globalists are moving in Africa, Asia, Latin America.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.604]  They're moving in the total takeover of Europe and the last shreds of sovereignty and citizens' chance to get out of it.
[00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.965]  A literal economic dictatorship.
[00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:33.289]  We're watching the control design depression launch here in this republic and they're trying to
[00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:40.214]  The very people that engineered this are now trying to trigger the people and divide and conquer and play us off against each other.
[00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:41.575]  So that's basically it.
[00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:42.316]  It's on.
[00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.638]  Things are just going to get crazier from here on out.
[00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:48.961]  We are literally seeing history unfold right now, Aaron.
[00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:50.122]  This is so amazing.
[00:15:50.142 --> 00:15:51.964]  I know you're about to get into that State Department story.
[00:15:52.224 --> 00:15:53.525]  We've got to get this out to everyone.
[00:15:53.545 --> 00:15:54.486]  People are so confused.
[00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:54.706]  They go,
[00:15:55.526 --> 00:15:59.731]  The corrupt elements of Wall Street, the big six megabanks and brokerage firms funded Obama.
[00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:01.632]  He went along with all the stuff Bush did.
[00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:06.537]  Bush followed the Clinton stuff with the architect of this, Alan Greenspan, the derivative, the bubble.
[00:16:06.818 --> 00:16:07.598]  They did all this.
[00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:10.181]  How can he say he's with Occupy Wall Street?
[00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:16.830]  Because they're with the element of Occupy Wall Street that wants to jack up taxes on the middle class and transfer it to the bankster.
[00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:22.478]  This is how the mega wealth was developed, was with government-public partnerships with these private entities.
[00:16:22.498 --> 00:16:23.699]  It's the UN agenda 21 model.
[00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:23.879]  It's on.
[00:16:25.842 --> 00:16:27.063]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:29.385]  But the good news is we're not just rolling over.
[00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:34.508]  We understood the enemy attack profile decades ago and warned people about the globalist paradigm.
[00:16:34.748 --> 00:16:46.637]  We planted so many seeds that now that we're right here at the edge of this situation, we've got a chance to defeat these people because the Paul Revere's of the Liberty Movement, who've been demonized and attacked all along, have been proven absolutely correct.
[00:16:46.857 --> 00:16:53.542]  So now we've got a chance to defeat these people because they miscalculated and didn't understand that we were going to continue to work to expose them to
[00:16:53.922 --> 00:16:54.182]  We're good.
[00:17:05.646 --> 00:17:08.728]  Yeah, and just for a background, you were talking about the Egypt revolution.
[00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:16.615]  Isn't it convenient how the heavy press coverage dropped off after the celebratory victory of the spontaneous revolution?
[00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:22.339]  Now you've got the military junta refusing to give over power, putting off elections, making excuses.
[00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:29.985]  In the news right now on the London Guardian, jailed Egyptian blogger on hunger strike says he's ready to die, declares he would rather
[00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:39.210]  commit suicide than be tried before this kangaroo court in front of the military junta just for criticizing them in a blog.
[00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:46.293]  But of course we have the State Department agitator who we now know is advising the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:53.597]  That is Ahmed Maher, helped lead Egypt's Arab Spring that resulted in military dictatorship.
[00:17:53.617 --> 00:17:55.438]  Paul Joseph Watson, a U.S.
[00:17:55.478 --> 00:18:00.220]  government-backed pioneer of the so-called Arab Spring in Egypt, eventually resulted in a
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:07.242]  Military Dictatorship is now advising the Occupy Wall Street protesters in another sign the movement's been subverted.
[00:18:08.403 --> 00:18:08.823]  Exactly.
[00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:18.166]  Look, Aaron, Aaron, I'm gonna let you go and let you get back to the show with Watson coming up and Alan Watt and then Tarpley, a jam-packed transmission on all these key subjects.
[00:18:18.206 --> 00:18:23.908]  Just understand, folks, most revolutions go bad and you get a French Revolution, not an American Revolution.
[00:18:24.388 --> 00:18:25.588]  That's what the Globalists want.
[00:18:25.648 --> 00:18:29.970]  They want to launch it themselves, try to steer it, use the old horror media,
[00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.152]  Establish a media to get this done.
[00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:35.374]  This is life and death situation to expose these people.
[00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:36.555]  Get back to what you're covering.
[00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:37.616]  God bless you all.
[00:18:37.656 --> 00:18:41.980]  We will defeat this globalist New World Order attempt to turn America into a communist state.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.721]  God bless you all.
[00:18:44.338 --> 00:18:45.438]  There goes Alex Jones.
[00:18:45.498 --> 00:18:46.178]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:50.419]  And we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson with more on this article in a moment.
[00:18:50.479 --> 00:18:53.160]  But yeah, of course, the energy is going to be there.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.701]  The question is what kind of chemistry is going to result from it?
[00:18:56.781 --> 00:19:03.322]  What catalyst will be put forward to transform that energy into the various solutions that are out there?
[00:19:03.802 --> 00:19:13.224]  The globalists have been masters for decades and decades at steering energy outside of the left-right paradigm back into the left-right paradigm that's
[00:19:13.984 --> 00:19:20.548]  largely what did happen with the Tea Party and hopefully it will not now happen with the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:19:20.588 --> 00:19:38.938]  We know from on-the-ground reports that many of the Occupy Wall Street protesters have nothing to do with the establishment but at the same time the signs are all there that they're being absorbed and here they are being steered by a State Department-backed agitator asset who is part of the Egypt revolution
[00:19:39.798 --> 00:19:41.058]  The Arab Spring of course.
[00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:44.939]  We will get more into that on the other side and lots of this economic news.
[00:19:45.459 --> 00:19:55.482]  EU bank failures posing another Wall Street crash while the FDIC has been put in a position to insure derivatives by the hundreds of trillions people.
[00:19:55.942 --> 00:19:58.902]  This is serious and we'll be back after this.
[00:19:59.062 --> 00:20:00.723]  Infowars.com on the other side.
[00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:01.103]  Stay tuned.

[00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:32.052]  A water secret so powerful, some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[00:20:32.592 --> 00:20:41.395]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, and even mercury and remove these accumulated poisons from your body and your drinking water.
[00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:48.497]  You can take your water freedom into your own hands and defend yourself and your family from the globalist health agenda.
[00:20:48.937 --> 00:20:51.518]  See the webinar before it's taken off the web.

[00:21:14.092 --> 00:21:19.555]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success
[00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:25.796]  That we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:30.898]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:21:31.058 --> 00:21:33.378]  The social network is nearing completion as well.
[00:21:33.518 --> 00:21:36.139]  The free newsletter is reaching hundreds of thousands.

[00:21:51.804 --> 00:21:53.605]  You are the resistance.
[00:21:53.865 --> 00:21:59.467]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:06.805]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.

[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:38.826]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:39.627]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.687 --> 00:22:45.811]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:45.951 --> 00:22:46.772]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.812 --> 00:22:49.914]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:22:52.615 --> 00:22:52.876]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.562]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[00:23:03.902 --> 00:23:09.305]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:10.226]  Why?
[00:23:10.566 --> 00:23:14.548]  When you can be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[00:23:39.682 --> 00:23:45.506]  Lecig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[00:23:45.786 --> 00:23:52.710]  Warning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or cancer.
[00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.215]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use.
[00:23:56.415 --> 00:23:58.798]  You must be 18 years or older to purchase.
[00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:20.341]  We're back at Infowars.com.
[00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:21.703]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in.
[00:24:21.763 --> 00:24:26.128]  You just heard Alex Jones and coming up in the next segment we have Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:31.535]  More foreign policy analysis coming up later with Webster Tarpley and Alan Watt.
[00:24:32.256 --> 00:24:35.260]  But as they are beating the drums for war with Iran...
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.782]  Of course, they've been provoking for a long time, but it's on the burner again.
[00:24:39.802 --> 00:24:44.925]  We have a clip from Ron Paul where he talks to Wolf Blitzer on CNN.
[00:24:44.965 --> 00:24:47.107]  I don't know if we have that ready, but if we could get it ready.
[00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:52.029]  He talks about how there's really been no evidence proven of this alleged assassination plot.
[00:24:53.328 --> 00:24:54.069]  We don't have the clip.
[00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:10.181]  I don't
[00:25:29.399 --> 00:25:30.740]  Uh, but it's pretty well written.
[00:25:45.024 --> 00:25:52.328]  When a string of European bank collapses is dead ahead, like the Arab Spring, they will trigger an economic disaster for American banks.
[00:25:52.888 --> 00:25:54.969]  Is this a perfect storm brewing?
[00:25:55.169 --> 00:25:56.270]  Obviously, we hope not.
[00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:04.034]  We were talking before the break about the way the energy is absorbed back into the establishment, back into the left-right paradigm.
[00:26:04.754 --> 00:26:13.819]  And it's just ironic that the Tea Party happens to be a perfect sort of metaphor for a venting of the steam of that heat energy as it's converted back into the left-right.
[00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:30.968]  Now we see Obama and other Democratic factions as well as the foundation-funded Soros and Rockefeller-backed factions trying to absorb that energy and transform it into their agenda to, quote, tax the rich while the true rich are offshore and really steering the revolutionaries.
[00:26:31.568 --> 00:26:47.374]  Isn't it ironic that the strength of the unions was largely built up because robber barons like the Rockefellers were so heavy-handed, but they have come to really steer those groups to finance a lot of the leftist political activity and the right for that matter.
[00:26:48.135 --> 00:26:50.336]  They really have learned to steer so much.
[00:26:50.756 --> 00:26:55.898]  Meanwhile, there's no money for streetlights, roving packs of wild dogs, and open-air drug markets.
[00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:58.719]  That's an economic collapse we have.
[00:27:00.646 --> 00:27:03.567]  Who is to blame Washington or Wall Street?
[00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:08.450]  A poll shows conservatives blame Washington's while many liberals blame Wall Street.
[00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.751]  Obviously they're working together for crony capitalism.
[00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:15.213]  We know that but it's being steered back into the left-right agenda.
[00:27:15.373 --> 00:27:23.877]  Last night at the GOP debate you have Herman Cain and Ron Paul going head-to-head over that sort of issue of whether or not to blame Wall Street.
[00:27:24.238 --> 00:27:26.259]  Herman Cain earlier made the statement
[00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:34.824]  That essentially the Occupy Wall Street people were to blame that they were just trying to hit out at Wall Street and that it was their fault if they're not rich.
[00:27:35.524 --> 00:27:42.369]  Ron Paul called out that they're blaming the victims and that really Wall Street does have a lot to answer for, while not everything of course.
[00:27:42.749 --> 00:27:44.490]  So much is going on in Washington as well.
[00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:45.811]  We'll keep an eye on that issue.
[00:27:46.691 --> 00:27:58.934]  The big Wall Street banks are already trying to buy the 2012 election and the winner is, if you follow the money, and of course the most money correlates about 90% of the time with who wins these major elections.
[00:27:58.954 --> 00:28:10.817]  2008 it was certainly Barack Obama with more Wall Street money than John McCain and so far in this 2012 cycle it is Mitt Romney again and again with the big bank money at the top of the list.
[00:28:11.377 --> 00:28:23.588]  For all of the big six banks including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and the rest of them, Ron Paul consistently at the bottom of that list.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.001]  Herman Cain too, even though he worked for the Federal Reserve and has opposed an audit.
[00:28:29.862 --> 00:28:32.282]  Debt serfdom is the new American normal.
[00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:44.286]  Trapped assets that generate no income streams are not capital, pointing out how American households are totally insolvent and are just swallowed up in debt and their assets lose value all the time.
[00:28:44.346 --> 00:28:53.429]  The Greeks have already shifted over 200 billion euros out of the country into Swiss banks, that is the quote fat cat Greeks as the Daily Mail calls them.
[00:28:53.969 --> 00:28:56.750]  Meanwhile, there is record protest there.
[00:28:57.271 --> 00:29:01.372]  The mother of all strikes shuts down Greece, reports Sky News.
[00:29:01.432 --> 00:29:09.516]  A two-day general strike has shut down public transport, schools and shop in Greece as over 50,000 protesters converge in central Athens.
[00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:16.039]  And of course, all the debates over further bailouts in Europe continue to threaten all the world markets.
[00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:20.281]  Bob Chapman has also written on this, on the coming stock market crash.
[00:29:20.321 --> 00:29:21.581]  The stock market will fall.
[00:29:21.621 --> 00:29:23.122]  The world is drowning in debt.
[00:29:24.491 --> 00:29:34.394]  And that, of course, is all on top of what I've already brought up, how the Federal Reserve has now pressured the FDIC into backing hundreds of trillions of derivatives from the major banks.
[00:29:34.454 --> 00:29:36.375]  We'll get into it with Paul Watson on the other side.
[00:29:36.415 --> 00:29:36.935]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:37.015 --> 00:29:39.096]  InfoWars, nightly news tonight.
[00:29:39.536 --> 00:29:40.796]  InfoWars.com right now.
[00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:51.019]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:53.020]  The empire's on the run.

[00:30:00.747 --> 00:30:04.070]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:05.791]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:09.875]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:12.297]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.317 --> 00:30:17.701]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:24.449]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:30.376]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.816 --> 00:30:34.481]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.981 --> 00:30:38.964]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.265 --> 00:30:44.769]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.172]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.773 --> 00:30:50.194]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.754 --> 00:30:51.255]  It's here.

[00:31:15.231 --> 00:31:22.414]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[00:31:22.634 --> 00:31:26.460]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.923]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[00:31:29.103 --> 00:31:33.890]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:34.371]  A $259 value for only $1.99.
[00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:35.032]  Save $60 on moisture.
[00:31:39.258 --> 00:31:39.778]  We're good to go!
[00:32:00.386 --> 00:32:01.507]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.547 --> 00:32:08.212]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.472 --> 00:32:10.773]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:11.034 --> 00:32:16.237]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.417 --> 00:32:19.199]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:21.521]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:27.686]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:28.006 --> 00:32:31.209]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:36.934]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.174 --> 00:32:38.495]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.815 --> 00:32:40.016]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:40.116 --> 00:32:42.658]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.798 --> 00:32:46.842]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:47.022 --> 00:32:49.043]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:49.824 --> 00:32:52.266]  You can run on for a long time Run on for a long time
[00:33:25.322 --> 00:33:27.205]  We are back in another long segment.
[00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:28.466]  I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in.
[00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:34.413]  Alex will be back tomorrow fired up and ready to talk about all these huge major world events going on.
[00:33:34.893 --> 00:33:38.938]  Right now we're joined by Prison Planet's main editor Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:46.502]  And he's written a very important article today, headlined State Department Agitator Advising Occupy Movement.
[00:33:47.142 --> 00:33:51.004]  That is someone who helped lead Egypt's Arab Spring with U.S.
[00:33:51.024 --> 00:33:56.066]  State Department backing, and now he is part of the Wall Street Movement, the Occupy Movement.
[00:33:56.406 --> 00:33:58.007]  Paul, are you there with us now?
[00:33:58.988 --> 00:34:00.048]  Good to be back, Aaron.
[00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.549]  Thanks, Paul.
[00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:03.750]  Why don't you help us break down this story?
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:18.668]  Well, I mean, we've documented at length attempts by lobbyist front groups for the Obama campaign, organisations like MoveOn.org, and their attempts to co-opt Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:20.890]  But this one goes a step further.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:33.703]  Because none other, as you mentioned, than the US State Department has now stepped in to try and subvert and control this movement, just as they did with the so-called Arab Spring from the start of the year.
[00:34:34.383 --> 00:34:48.706]  And Wired News is reporting that Ahmed Marr, who was one of the leading pioneers of the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt, is now, quote, advising the Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York and Washington DC.
[00:34:50.026 --> 00:34:52.828]  So, I mean, why should that provoke suspicion?
[00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:56.491]  Well, because Maher is basically a stooge of the U.S.
[00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.332]  State Department.
[00:34:57.412 --> 00:35:16.327]  It was the State Department who, years before the uprising in Egypt, trained and funded all these faux revolutionaries, Maher prime amongst them, through the Alliance for Youth Movement Summit in 2008, as well as the Canvas organization after that.
[00:35:17.108 --> 00:35:26.074]  And it was actually Ahmed Ma's April 6th organisation, that's what it's called, the genesis of it at least, who met in 2008.
[00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:39.069]  You know, three years before the uprising in Egypt, with the likes of the CFR, Homeland Security, the State Department, and heads of some of the biggest corporations in the world.
[00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:44.451]  And they met to, quote, facilitate solutions to problem spots in the world.
[00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:50.953]  So we have these umbrella organizations who proclaim to be grassroots activists.
[00:35:51.773 --> 00:35:58.459]  All of which, you know, regularly convene and get their marching orders from the US government and the heads of top corporations.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:05.325]  Now, they're becoming involved in directing and steering the Occupy Wall Street movement.
[00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:07.748]  So, you know, Houston, we have a problem.
[00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:09.715]  Yeah, I would say so.
[00:36:10.096 --> 00:36:24.321]  I'd like to remind the audience that Al Gore, none other than the climate change, carbon tax, former vice president, called for an American version of the Arab Spring just about three weeks before it actually kicked off, Paul.
[00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:28.102]  Now we have someone from the Arab Spring helping to steer it.
[00:36:28.202 --> 00:36:33.044]  Someone who even the Egyptian protesters called a dictator and tried to kick out of the group.
[00:36:34.724 --> 00:36:35.405]  Well, precisely.
[00:36:37.274 --> 00:36:43.979]  It looks like they're trying to turn Occupy Wall Street into an American Spring, which as you said is exactly what Al Gore called for.
[00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:53.085]  Which is worrying because the Arab Spring certainly in Egypt, you know, did not result in some glorious grassroots people's revolution.
[00:36:53.525 --> 00:36:56.127]  It resulted in a military dictatorship.
[00:36:56.147 --> 00:37:05.274]  The tyranny in Egypt is now worse under this interim military hunter which refuses to relinquish power than it ever was under Mubarak.
[00:37:06.114 --> 00:37:10.178]  The military's killing minorities, imprisoning dissidents.
[00:37:10.378 --> 00:37:24.710]  It's worse than it was before they kicked him out because from the very start it was steered, subverted, infiltrated by these very State Department CFR interests who use people like Maher as their stooge to go in there and do that.
[00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:30.293]  Well, there's other characters.
[00:37:30.353 --> 00:37:32.736]  I mean, Ivan Marovitch.
[00:37:33.056 --> 00:37:37.021]  He was on the ground in New York on the very first day of the protest.
[00:37:37.662 --> 00:37:46.673]  And he was the one that taught them how to use this creepy collectivist consensus thing where, you know, they all repeat these zombie-like mantras.
[00:37:47.634 --> 00:37:54.459]  His group is called Optor, and it's one of these same umbrella organisations similar to the April 6th organisation.
[00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:59.903]  This is the group the CIA sponsored to help get rid of Slobodan Milosevic.
[00:38:00.363 --> 00:38:04.986]  This is the group backed by the US National Endowment for Democracy.
[00:38:05.506 --> 00:38:07.608]  And we've seen their clenched fist logo.
[00:38:08.028 --> 00:38:12.932]  It's a specific type of logo, it's not just a generic clenched fist appear on these Wall Street
[00:38:13.772 --> 00:38:30.215]  Occupy Wall Street banners and it's because the leader of that organization was there on the ground at the very start coordinating a lot of it and his group is admittedly a CIA National Endowment for Democracy front that has been used in the past by the US military-industrial complex to help do its bidding.
[00:38:31.294 --> 00:38:41.503]  Yeah, I mean, we had on-the-ground reports there in Egypt, Max Keiser, if I recall properly, saying, you know, this is spontaneous, these are real people in the streets, true grassroots.
[00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:49.471]  And I believe all those reports, but at the same time, we now know about the groups behind that movement that seemed to crop up spontaneously.
[00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:53.995]  And then where was the press coverage after all that celebratory stuff?
[00:38:54.936 --> 00:38:57.138]  What's going on with leaders like El Baradei?
[00:38:57.558 --> 00:39:05.084]  You know, with ties to the International Crisis Group and the CFR, even now, today, he's calling for a new roadmap to Egypt.
[00:39:05.644 --> 00:39:06.705]  For Egypt, rather, you know?
[00:39:06.725 --> 00:39:08.767]  Let's see where I'm going with this, Paul.
[00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:19.111]  Precisely, and the International Crisis Group also fraternised with this Ahmed Marr, and of course that involves Zbigniew Brzezinski and George Soros on top of that.
[00:39:19.672 --> 00:39:21.534]  So it's all the same characters again.
[00:39:21.935 --> 00:39:27.923]  I mean, these groups are formed in what they call revolution training schools in places like Serbia.
[00:39:28.363 --> 00:39:29.084]  We're good to go.
[00:39:46.758 --> 00:39:55.246]  Do you really think they're just going to stand by and let that vacuum of power allow anyone to step in and take control of that key country in the Middle East?
[00:39:55.306 --> 00:39:55.506]  No.
[00:39:55.606 --> 00:39:57.748]  Which is why they were on it from the very start.
[00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:06.617]  So to think that these same interests weren't also watching Occupy Wall Street from the very start would be naive to say the least.
[00:40:09.383 --> 00:40:10.585]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:40:10.605 --> 00:40:12.327]  We just need to continue to watch that.
[00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:22.723]  Now you reported a couple days ago on the government front group known as Demos who have called to abolish critical thinking and they're re-educating students in the classroom.
[00:40:22.743 --> 00:40:24.626]  Paul, can we talk about that some?
[00:40:26.226 --> 00:40:29.349]  Yeah, this is a government front group.
[00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:33.672]  It was actually founded by Marxists back in the 90s.
[00:40:33.712 --> 00:40:36.895]  It was then closely affiliated with Tony Blair's Labour Party.
[00:40:37.616 --> 00:40:46.403]  Now David Cameron, the current Prime Minister, has given speeches at their events as part of their, quote, progressive conservatism agenda.
[00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:49.446]  And basically the article I wrote was about how
[00:40:50.677 --> 00:41:14.259]  Demos is now going into schools in Great Britain and teaching students how to maintain critical thinking and they do this by basically saying that anything that disagrees with the official version of events either from government or the mainstream media is a quote conspiracy theory and then they go on to define the term conspiracy theory as completely false.
[00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:14.999]  So
[00:41:15.841 --> 00:41:22.882]  I wrote that it's a fantastic irony that while they're trying to promote quote critical thinking they're actually
[00:41:24.235 --> 00:41:40.424]  In an authoritarian manner, telling people that they can't have critical thinking and that they can't trust alternative sources of information, which, as we've seen over the past few years, though not perfect, have proven a damn sight more accurate than the likes of the BBC, which is where this report went out.
[00:41:41.144 --> 00:41:45.666]  You know, from weapons of mass destruction, the murder of Dr David Kelly,
[00:41:46.947 --> 00:42:01.664]  Um, the establishment has proven itself completely not credible in these instances, and yet Demos is going in and saying that children aren't allowed to bring conspiracy theories into the classroom, when it was the British government who
[00:42:01.664 --> 00:42:08.186]  You ordered Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, which was found by a British High Court judge to contain nine significant errors.
[00:42:08.286 --> 00:42:14.287]  It was the British government that ordered that film to be shown to school children in England, Wales and Scotland.
[00:42:14.307 --> 00:42:21.989]  So while the government's enforcing this BS onto them, they're simultaneously saying that, you know, if you question it, then you're going to be in trouble.
[00:42:22.049 --> 00:42:31.171]  And Demos has been sent in there as this government lobbying group to ensure that students don't have critical thinking, because that underpins the entire education system.
[00:42:31.451 --> 00:42:38.856]  Alright Paul, I think we want to go to a clip of that now, but of course this is textbook, almost word-for-word out of the Cass Sunstein playbook.
[00:42:39.276 --> 00:42:40.798]  That's Obama's information czar.
[00:42:40.838 --> 00:42:50.084]  He wrote a paper in 2008 on conspiracy theories, how they need to be infiltrated and how that information needs to be steered and broken up and otherwise undermined.
[00:42:50.564 --> 00:42:52.846]  Let's go to that clip now and then talk more about Cass Sunstein.
[00:42:57.819 --> 00:42:59.280]  Okay, we're having some technical issues.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.700]  They're going to cue up that audio.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.601]  The consequences can be dangerous.
[00:43:02.981 --> 00:43:09.223]  That's the warning from the think tank Demos, which is concerned that conspiracy theories and propaganda are entering the classroom.
[00:43:09.643 --> 00:43:12.304]  The BBC Asian Network's Katrin Nye now reports.
[00:43:13.004 --> 00:43:15.225]  We're here about information and how we get it.
[00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:19.107]  So, you have trust on one side and you have distrust on the other side.
[00:43:19.447 --> 00:43:23.968]  Two school sessions in which Demos explored pupils' online abilities in Liverpool.
[00:43:24.389 --> 00:43:25.409]  I was searching on Google.
[00:43:26.693 --> 00:43:29.076]  I don't believe the first answer that came up, to be honest.
[00:43:29.838 --> 00:43:33.643]  I know I shouldn't do it, but Google's, like, a trusted website.
[00:43:34.124 --> 00:43:37.488]  And in East London, where conspiracy theories are quickly raised.
[00:43:37.508 --> 00:43:39.010]  There was a documentary about this guy.
[00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.654]  He does his own research finding out that, um...
[00:43:42.495 --> 00:43:46.840]  In one of the FBI, you know, the building that got hit by a bomb, a plane.
[00:43:47.941 --> 00:43:51.846]  Apparently it was not a plane, it was a missile from the army.
[00:43:51.886 --> 00:43:56.812]  Some pupils are internet savvy, others fall foul to the problems the think tank says are common.
[00:43:57.212 --> 00:44:01.978]  Demos brought together existing research and surveyed 500 teachers across England and Wales.
[00:44:02.358 --> 00:44:12.741]  Teachers are increasingly finding that their pupils are bringing into the classroom conspiracy theories, misinformation, propaganda that they found on the internet.
[00:44:13.382 --> 00:44:22.905]  And what I think that means is that young people aren't really being taught enough about how to critically assess and evaluate the information that they're finding online.
[00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:27.369]  Demos want digital judgment to be a core part of the curriculum.
[00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.891]  They say teachers need the training and resources to do that.
[00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:35.393]  And they want parents to encourage their children to think more critically.
[00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.073]  Okay, that's enough of that clip.
[00:44:37.474 --> 00:44:39.154]  But Paul Watson, what's your reaction?
[00:44:39.194 --> 00:44:50.059]  They bring in 9-11 conspiracy theories there, and they openly talk about how you can only trust official propaganda sources when there's more propaganda going on than during the Soviet Union, Paul.
[00:44:51.468 --> 00:44:53.209]  Well, yeah, again, it's complete hypocrisy.
[00:44:53.249 --> 00:44:57.293]  They say, oh, we just want to encourage critical thinking, when they're doing the exact opposite.
[00:44:57.333 --> 00:45:01.916]  They're saying, believe the government, believe the mainstream media, everything else is BS.
[00:45:02.476 --> 00:45:12.564]  And, I mean, they put out a report, this Demos Group, which, again, is just a front for the government, always has been, founded by Marxists, called the Power of Unreason.
[00:45:12.965 --> 00:45:21.171]  And in that report, they say they need to, quote, fight back against people who question the authorities to, quote, increase trust in government.
[00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:25.012]  And they advocate infiltrating conspiracy websites.
[00:45:25.052 --> 00:45:28.233]  So it's, as he said, it's the Cass Sunstein model.
[00:45:28.573 --> 00:45:34.174]  It's not just, you know, getting in a marketplace of ideas and saying let's look at all different sides of the story.
[00:45:34.214 --> 00:45:44.016]  It's saying this is extremist, this is wrong, and in their own report they go on to basically say that anyone who questions the government is an extremist and a quote terrorist recruiter.
[00:45:44.596 --> 00:45:47.457]  And so as Cass Sunstein's agenda was to
[00:45:47.817 --> 00:45:52.979]  Admittedly about, you know, he went on to talk about why don't we tax certain ideas or ban free speech.
[00:45:53.379 --> 00:46:13.486]  That's precisely the core of this Demos group's agenda and they're trying to, because they know kids in British schools are starting to get information which contradicts what they're being taught in schools on their own government curriculums, they're getting very worried about it and that's why they need to launch these kind of infiltration strategies.
[00:46:14.969 --> 00:46:34.361]  And of course, Cass Sunstein talks about infiltrating in his conspiracy theory papers at least 14 times, and openly talks about the 9-11 conspiracy theories in particular, and how all this kind of alternative information poses a threat to the establishment, whether or not it's true, simply that it poses a threat to the establishment.
[00:46:35.748 --> 00:46:36.268]  Precisely.
[00:46:36.348 --> 00:46:48.995]  I mean, that's why, and it's not a conspiracy theory anymore, CENTCOM, Israel, they all admit to it, they hire armies of people to go online to vote things up or down, to leave negative comments.
[00:46:49.535 --> 00:46:51.116]  That's part of cyber warfare.
[00:46:51.576 --> 00:46:55.238]  It's 2011, that's a routine part of cyber warfare.
[00:46:56.459 --> 00:46:59.681]  We certainly are subject to that on a regular basis, you know.
[00:47:00.561 --> 00:47:08.347]  Alex was talking the other day about how immediately when the Alex Jones Channel releases a video, it gets voted down by 11 people.
[00:47:09.308 --> 00:47:13.991]  Often they don't even leave comments, just instantly voted down with 11 dislikes.
[00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:16.914]  And that's precisely what happened on one I saw the other day.
[00:47:17.354 --> 00:47:21.397]  Almost minutes after it was uploaded, 11 people had voted it down.
[00:47:21.437 --> 00:47:29.323]  So they've literally hired people to sit on our websites and other websites and engage in this, you know, infiltration effort.
[00:47:29.643 --> 00:47:30.124]  Well, I mean...
[00:47:50.487 --> 00:47:56.309]  Last night, Obama gave this interview where, again, he's offering support for Occupy Wall Street.
[00:47:56.329 --> 00:48:01.471]  We've had Bede and Pelosi, you know, the rest of the Democratic machine, offer their support for it.
[00:48:02.152 --> 00:48:07.394]  Obama's basically trying to exploit the whole movement as an election campaign gimmick.
[00:48:07.434 --> 00:48:09.334]  He's trying to pose as a populist.
[00:48:09.835 --> 00:48:14.777]  And we predicted this would happen several weeks ago, along with other people like Gerald Solenti.
[00:48:15.817 --> 00:48:21.102]  When in reality, you know, his 2008 campaign completely funded by Wall Street.
[00:48:21.122 --> 00:48:23.904]  He's received the most money from Wall Street out of any candidate.
[00:48:23.924 --> 00:48:27.648]  His cabinet's stuffed with Wall Street insiders.
[00:48:27.808 --> 00:48:34.193]  He's even more reliant on Wall Street in 2012 because we know a lot of the money's also gone behind Mitt Romney.
[00:48:35.034 --> 00:48:45.943]  But I mean, for Obama to pose and embrace this movement when he's, you know, he's Mr. Wall Street himself, he's the ultimate Wall Street puppet, just shows how people are trying to co-opt this.
[00:48:46.644 --> 00:48:50.868]  But according to the polls which you covered last night on Nightly News, it's probably
[00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:59.174]  A little over half of Americans actually see right through that and they still blame Washington itself more so than Wall Street.
[00:48:59.214 --> 00:49:06.539]  So it's a desperate attempt by the Obama campaign to wrap himself in this phony cloak of populism.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.942]  But I mean, it looks like it's probably going to fail.
[00:49:10.771 --> 00:49:11.631]  I mean, what do you call that?
[00:49:11.691 --> 00:49:15.272]  How do you steer people towards the crony capitalism problem?
[00:49:15.772 --> 00:49:28.135]  Just as we saw in the Daily Bail today that the Federal Reserve facilitated absorbing basically hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives and guaranteeing that they'd be insured by the FDIC, Paul.
[00:49:28.435 --> 00:49:31.716]  I mean, that is a Wall Street problem, but it's certainly a Washington issue as well.
[00:49:32.216 --> 00:49:34.137]  But we're not allowed to talk about the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:35.475 --> 00:49:43.140]  Well, no, I mean, you had the reports at Occupy Wall Street demonstrations where they were saying, you know, if you've got a run-poll sign, get out of here.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.462]  And it's a fundamental problem that comes up time and time again.
[00:49:46.942 --> 00:50:04.293]  I think it's fair to say, judging from the PBS poll which I talked about, which was in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, probably about 50% of those protesters in New York and DC and other places are aware of the true scope of the problem, that it's more than just Wall Street, as you were just mentioning.
[00:50:04.993 --> 00:50:13.700]  But then you've got this strain which is becoming increasingly dominant, I'm afraid to say, who are basically communists, socialists and collectivists.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:29.893]  And they're being led by the likes of Francis Fox Piven and all these other leftist elites to call for the destruction of capitalism and its replacement with this state-mandated redistribution of wealth by violent force.
[00:50:30.414 --> 00:50:32.996]  I mean, we had the Communist Party USA
[00:50:33.836 --> 00:50:35.518]  A few days ago, March in Chicago.
[00:50:35.538 --> 00:50:36.219]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:50:36.239 --> 00:50:37.900]  We're coming up on a break.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.483]  The 1%, I think it's more like the 0.1%, maybe the 0.01%.
[00:50:42.945 --> 00:50:46.568]  Let's get more into this issue and how we can get more sophisticated on the problem.
[00:50:46.948 --> 00:50:49.130]  Occupy Wall Street, the energy is there.
[00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.552]  Which direction will it go?
[00:50:50.612 --> 00:50:51.152]  Stay tuned.

[00:52:58.295 --> 00:53:04.559]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:53:04.879 --> 00:53:05.460]  Number one.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.763]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:53:10.063 --> 00:53:14.627]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:53:14.967 --> 00:53:15.407]  It's true.
[00:53:15.707 --> 00:53:21.131]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:53:21.392 --> 00:53:24.694]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:53:24.994 --> 00:53:28.677]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:53:28.897 --> 00:53:29.438]  Number 4.
[00:53:29.678 --> 00:53:32.040]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:53:32.441 --> 00:53:35.824]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:36.345]  Number 5.
[00:53:36.925 --> 00:53:40.830]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:45.835]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:53:46.115 --> 00:53:50.139]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:50.279 --> 00:53:51.841]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:52.061 --> 00:53:54.163]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:53:54.323 --> 00:53:56.666]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:54:22.045 --> 00:54:25.707]  Paul Joseph Watson, editor of PrisonPlanet.com, is with us.
[00:54:26.548 --> 00:54:29.970]  We are essentially wrapping up our analysis of Occupy Wall Street.
[00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.071]  Paul, we were cut off by the break.
[00:54:32.091 --> 00:54:33.892]  Can you please continue with the point you were making?
[00:54:35.287 --> 00:54:50.263]  Yeah, I was just making the point that from the poll figures that we've seen it looks like there's about 50% of the demonstrators who understand the full scope of the problem and also understand that communism and socialism aren't the answer.
[00:54:50.604 --> 00:54:57.191]  But then there's another hardcore, I mean this is a quote from a New York Post columnist who went and visited them.
[00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:04.083]  Quote, it's not an overstatement to describe Zuccotti Park as New York's Marxist epicenter.
[00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:08.972]  Flags with the iconic face of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara are everywhere.
[00:55:09.912 --> 00:55:12.754]  The only American flag I saw was hanging upside down.
[00:55:13.114 --> 00:55:26.984]  The occupiers openly refer to each other as Comrade, and just about every piece of literature on offer advocated socialism in the Marxist tradition as a cure-all for the inequalities of the American economic system.
[00:55:27.785 --> 00:55:34.850]  So, I mean, you've got Communist Party USA marching in Chicago, and, you know, they get cheered by the demonstrators.
[00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.472]  And a lot of people don't want to hear this, but
[00:55:39.317 --> 00:55:49.335]  50% of that movement, I mean there's a lot of great people involved, but the ones leading the chorus, and you can see this in the Adam Kakesh interviews, they're collectivists.
[00:55:49.395 --> 00:55:52.280]  They want to concentrate more power in the hands of government.
[00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:54.392]  Well, that's the issue, really.
[00:55:54.472 --> 00:56:03.478]  Even in a rosy analysis, it's been extreme abuses of big government, all the insider deals and the rest of it that's helped contribute to so much of these problems.
[00:56:04.118 --> 00:56:13.684]  And many people, as you point out, want another big government solution, want more big government, think that taxing the quote rich will somehow fix our issues.
[00:56:14.224 --> 00:56:19.368]  Of course, the austerity measures to tax the middle class and lower class are equally flawed.
[00:56:20.028 --> 00:56:22.670]  But how are we going to begin to rein in these offshore interests?
[00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:33.382]  Well, by understanding that it's the Federal Reserve that, you know, gave the green light for the trillions in bailout money to foreign banks mainly.
[00:56:33.842 --> 00:56:37.465]  That doesn't seem to be a central problem with a lot of these protesters.
[00:56:37.505 --> 00:56:39.907]  You know, they're not occupying the Fed.
[00:56:40.587 --> 00:56:52.957]  I mean, we had a protest last week where Alex Jones went and led a rally, but primarily they're occupying places in New York, they're not occupying the White House lawn, when these are the sources of most of the problems.
[00:56:53.457 --> 00:57:03.605]  And their solution to the problem of corporate greed is to give the government power to seize wealth by force, by violent means if necessary.
[00:57:04.105 --> 00:57:13.932]  And remember that a third of the protesters, according to this poll I mentioned in the Wall Street Journal, support using violence to enforce their ideas.
[00:57:14.433 --> 00:57:21.058]  And they want to concentrate that power in the hands of government to oversee this program of, quote, fair redistribution.
[00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:34.408]  Which, of course, you know, every example throughout history tells us that this never works and that it always ends up with an even more tyrannical and corrupt state while, you know, the country itself rots away and the people are enslaved.
[00:57:34.648 --> 00:57:41.833]  I mean, maybe that's why North Korea came out and embraced Occupy Wall Street because that perfectly describes their country.
[00:57:42.413 --> 00:57:49.819]  So, as you said, there's a tipping point and it's getting to the level where the communists and the collectivists are starting to take this over.
[00:57:51.547 --> 00:57:54.888]  You know, the other side of the Occupy Wall Street is the police occupation.
[00:57:54.948 --> 00:57:58.930]  I mean, we've got a kind of militarized police action down there.
[00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:12.276]  And whatever the views of these protesters may be, why are police beating them, slamming women's heads, dragging people into banks, basically protecting the banks directly, arresting people, trying to close accounts, and all the rest of it?
[00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.197]  Well, let's talk about it on the other side.
[00:58:14.217 --> 00:58:16.898]  We also have Webster Tarpley and then Alan Watt coming up.
[00:58:17.578 --> 00:58:18.099]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:19.220]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.602]  Aaron Dyk sitting in.
[00:58:20.762 --> 00:58:21.804]  Alex back tomorrow.
[00:58:22.444 --> 00:58:23.346]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:47.274]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.918 --> 00:58:56.221]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:58:56.621 --> 00:59:02.486]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:59:03.046 --> 00:59:04.807]  Number one, study the past.
[00:59:05.328 --> 00:59:07.089]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:11.453]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:59:12.563 --> 00:59:14.825]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:59:15.646 --> 00:59:18.928]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:24.213]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:59:24.533 --> 00:59:27.996]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:59:28.556 --> 00:59:31.419]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:59:31.959 --> 00:59:35.843]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:36.423 --> 00:59:40.687]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:59:41.367 --> 00:59:45.491]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:45.991 --> 00:59:48.774]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:59:53.658 --> 00:59:55.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.843]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.404 --> 01:00:09.588]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.249 --> 01:00:11.050]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:12.732]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.372 --> 01:00:16.996]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.577 --> 01:00:21.641]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.033 --> 01:00:31.460]  It is the second hour and we are just getting started with the full scale, all points analysis.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:36.325]  We have Webster Tarpley coming up on the other side of this break, then later Alan Watt.
[01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:40.150]  But right now we are with Paul Joseph Watson, PrisonPlanet.com editor.
[01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:44.095]  Also in the news today in the London Telegraph, White House accused
[01:00:44.435 --> 01:00:44.695]  I think so.
[01:01:01.889 --> 01:01:09.472]  To the nation to give the impression he was sitting in front of a car assembly line in Detroit when in fact it was just later digitally added.
[01:01:09.552 --> 01:01:12.454]  He was not in fact giving a speech in front of a car plant.
[01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:19.837]  Just kind of another little note in this symphony of economic disaster that's spiraling out of control.
[01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:24.759]  It's no wonder people are out crying over the economic implosion.
[01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:26.680]  The question is where will the energy go, Paul?
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.993]  And what is happening with the police state on the police side of things of this Occupy Wall Street movement?
[01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:34.811]  Well, I mean, you're right.
[01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:46.396]  It gives the police the opportunity to crack some heads, and a lot of the American people support it, because these people will have been demonized by some sectors of the mainstream media.
[01:01:47.196 --> 01:01:52.218]  The police go in with a heavy-handed response, and a lot of the American people support it.
[01:01:52.238 --> 01:01:55.740]  A similar thing happens in England when these protests take place.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.882]  So yeah, it's a police-state bandwagon, and of course they get the opportunity to do that.
[01:02:02.483 --> 01:02:07.846]  And that's only going to continue as these occupation events are prolonged.
[01:02:08.106 --> 01:02:17.310]  I'm sure that certainly in Europe, the cold weather is going to put a stop to a lot of it because people simply won't be able to camp out all night.
[01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:22.873]  But certainly in America, I can see this going on for several weeks and months to come, yeah.
[01:02:24.666 --> 01:02:29.987]  Yeah, and then you've got reports of donations from major banks to the police department.
[01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:43.490]  You've got police on video helping corral protesters back into banks so they could be arrested for allegedly causing a disruption when they simply tried to close their bank accounts, regardless of if they were protesters.
[01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:52.112]  What are we seeing in kind of this fascist nexus between the Wall Street big banks, who are really behind the Wall Street problems, and the police there to defend them?
[01:02:53.632 --> 01:02:58.737]  Well, of course they're completely allied with each other in a close relationship.
[01:02:58.797 --> 01:03:01.179]  I mean, all these... Same with Obama.
[01:03:01.219 --> 01:03:09.327]  I mean, he's the biggest Wall Street puppet going, but in this poll, which I've been talking about, 50% of the protesters say they're going to vote for him again!
[01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:15.010]  So, I don't... I mean, it's the same people falling for the same tricks over and over again.
[01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.551]  But it's only half of them, you know.
[01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:23.513]  In years gone by, it might be 70-80% of them falling for these same political stunts again and again.
[01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:29.395]  So, it's up to us, the alternative media, to really get in there and try and dictate the conversation.
[01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:37.098]  Otherwise, these Obama lobby groups will do so and they'll continue to define where all this energy goes in the long run.
[01:03:38.502 --> 01:03:38.902]  I don't know.
[01:03:38.942 --> 01:03:46.064]  Sometimes I think people like being conned, that they almost find power in people who are obviously lying and telling them what they want to hear.
[01:03:46.764 --> 01:03:47.444]  I don't know where this goes.
[01:03:47.464 --> 01:03:48.045]  You're right.
[01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:48.765]  They're lazy.
[01:03:49.105 --> 01:03:51.706]  I mean, it's not easy to see through it, honestly.
[01:03:51.726 --> 01:03:55.547]  It's not easy to see, oh, this guy's involved in Occupy Wall Street.
[01:03:55.607 --> 01:03:58.427]  Three years ago, he was working with the State Department to do this.
[01:03:58.827 --> 01:04:00.228]  Two years before that, he was doing that.
[01:04:00.908 --> 01:04:04.730]  People are never going to look into that because they don't have the time to scratch below the surface.
[01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:16.856]  So, you know, it takes a bit more gumption and interest in the subject to actually find out what's going on, which is why it's easier for them to fall for these simple-minded stunts every time.
[01:04:17.216 --> 01:04:19.237]  So that's our job, to prevent that from happening.
[01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:21.968]  And of course the way the media is portraying it.
[01:04:22.188 --> 01:04:28.052]  And yeah, I mean, we just have to get ready for the same kind of Tea Party co-opting with this Occupy Wall Street energy.
[01:04:28.112 --> 01:04:32.294]  What kind of new taxes will they impose based on the supposed demands?
[01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:38.918]  We have Webster Tarpley on the other side and more analysis of Iran, Occupy Wall Street and much more coming up.
[01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.779]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:41.139 --> 01:04:43.200]  Later today, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.321]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:05.762]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:09.166]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.426 --> 01:05:14.190]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:20.456]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:22.839]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:23.579]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:23.819]  Bernanke?
[01:05:23.839 --> 01:05:24.200]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:24.960]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.581]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:49.215]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.555 --> 01:05:58.682]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:06.351]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.691 --> 01:06:14.797]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:19.581]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:20.181 --> 01:06:30.990]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:40.633]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:41.133 --> 01:06:46.195]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.555 --> 01:06:53.738]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:54.038 --> 01:06:56.459]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:00.749 --> 01:07:01.869]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:07:01.909 --> 01:07:08.592]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:08.852 --> 01:07:11.132]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:16.594]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:16.774 --> 01:07:19.555]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:19.815 --> 01:07:21.876]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:22.136 --> 01:07:28.060]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:28.381 --> 01:07:31.583]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:31.763 --> 01:07:37.287]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:37.547 --> 01:07:38.868]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.389]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.991]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:43.171 --> 01:07:47.213]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:51.855]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:51.995 --> 01:07:54.456]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:07:54.597 --> 01:07:58.298]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:00.159]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.183]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.803 --> 01:08:11.785]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.659 --> 01:08:29.024]  We are back on this important Wednesday broadcast covering so much of what's happening in the world events.
[01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.485]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in.
[01:08:30.645 --> 01:08:35.148]  Alex again will be back tomorrow ready to go with all the breakthroughs.
[01:08:35.228 --> 01:08:46.256]  Right now we are joined by Dr. Webster Tarpley, a PhD in history, a longtime analyst and critic who's been right about so many things and a truth teller to boot.
[01:08:46.836 --> 01:08:48.037]  Thanks for joining us, Webster.
[01:08:52.659 --> 01:08:53.379]  Are you there, Webster?
[01:08:53.639 --> 01:08:54.320]  Yes, hi.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.500]  Okay, now I hear you.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:08.705]  Yeah, so out of the gates, we've been talking all morning about this State Department agitator, Ahmed Marr, who has now been openly advising the Occupy movement, and he was part of Egypt's Arab Spring.
[01:09:08.725 --> 01:09:09.806]  What do you know about this, Webster?
[01:09:11.005 --> 01:09:15.967]  Well, this is just one case of many, and I think you've got to put this in perspective.
[01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:21.188]  The Occupy Wall Street movement is a tremendously positive development.
[01:09:21.248 --> 01:09:25.670]  It's exactly what we need in the sense that it finally tells people who is the enemy.
[01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.371]  And Wall Street finance capital is the enemy.
[01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.691]  Any other enemy is a sham.
[01:09:30.912 --> 01:09:32.072]  Are you fighting anybody else?
[01:09:32.492 --> 01:09:33.474]  You're wasting your time.
[01:09:33.794 --> 01:09:35.377]  This is an authentic mass strike.
[01:09:35.597 --> 01:09:38.081]  It started in Wisconsin in February.
[01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:42.748]  It kicked over into Ohio, a bunch of other places, fighting these reactionary governors.
[01:09:43.289 --> 01:09:46.574]  But now it's this Occupy Wall Street.
[01:09:46.614 --> 01:09:47.957]  Now, the problem, of course, is
[01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:58.943]  That whereas the ferment, right, when you see members of the Transport Workers Union and Local 199, people that work in hospitals, these are real working people with real concerns.
[01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:02.365]  And sometimes they do get interviewed, and you can hear what they think.
[01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:09.810]  The problem, of course, is that the intelligence community has prepared a counterinsurgency apparatus.
[01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.611]  So I wouldn't call this guy an advisor.
[01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:12.651]  He's a wrecker.
[01:10:12.832 --> 01:10:13.772]  He's a saboteur.
[01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.073]  He's a brainwasher.
[01:10:15.613 --> 01:10:19.395]  And I have tried very hard to delve into how this stuff was all done.
[01:10:19.475 --> 01:10:26.479]  It started during the summer in a steering committee in 16 Beaver Street, which means basically Wall Street.
[01:10:26.499 --> 01:10:29.061]  It's right down there in the financial district.
[01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:35.745]  And we got a couple of veterans of European wrecking operations.
[01:10:35.785 --> 01:10:41.068]  I think many of these people are suspected of having connections to NATO intelligence.
[01:10:41.108 --> 01:10:43.449]  We're told, for example, in an article in Mother Jones,
[01:10:44.049 --> 01:10:52.313]  That a lady called Begonia and a guy called Luis came in from Madrid and he said, oh, we just had the wonderful indignados of Madrid and isn't that great?
[01:10:52.713 --> 01:10:59.236]  And we had this general assembly where we have consensus and facilitators and all the rest of this and you guys should copy it.
[01:10:59.276 --> 01:11:04.778]  Now, the problem, of course, with copying the Madrid indignados is that they were a total failure.
[01:11:05.218 --> 01:11:22.491]  And one of the main reasons they failed, totally, completely, absolutely, was because they had this straitjacket, this crazy consensus method, which means you don't get any leaders, you get these creepy facilitators who are not political leaders, but they're technical experts in this idiotic system.
[01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:26.754]  And of course, since they debate like it's a filibuster, right?
[01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:28.415]  Nothing but an endless filibuster.
[01:11:28.995 --> 01:11:33.216]  They debate about what to have for lunch and where to put the garbage cans and all this stuff.
[01:11:33.516 --> 01:11:35.696]  They never get down to having any demand.
[01:11:35.776 --> 01:11:43.798]  So you look at the Indiñados, the main international monetary fund agent on the scene was Zapatero at the beginning and he's still there.
[01:11:43.818 --> 01:11:45.458]  They failed.
[01:11:45.498 --> 01:11:49.158]  Now, I delved a little bit further into these Indiñados.
[01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:53.539]  A lady called Pilar Bazelga, and if you can read Spanish, you can go to her site.
[01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:54.999]  No morir, idiota.
[01:11:55.079 --> 01:11:55.980]  Don't die a fool.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.780]  It can be translated quite easily.
[01:11:58.521 --> 01:12:06.931]  She, on my radio program this past week, she said, look, the camp of the Indignados was built by the Spanish Army.
[01:12:07.071 --> 01:12:13.299]  It was built essentially by NATO, and they got all kinds of, you know, positive things that were essentially deliberate.
[01:12:13.619 --> 01:12:16.701]  But the price of this, of course, is that those people then run the show.
[01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:19.122]  And her quote on it was, I think, a very good one.
[01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:25.666]  The Indiñados were a soap opera for zombies who thought they were doing the revolution.
[01:12:25.886 --> 01:12:29.588]  Now, the answer to this, of course, is don't give up on the revolution.
[01:12:29.908 --> 01:12:33.230]  The revolution against finance, capital, and Wall Street is the one.
[01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.410]  It's the authentic one.
[01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.772]  But what you've got to do is kick out these facilitators.
[01:12:38.853 --> 01:12:39.473]  Get rid of them.
[01:12:40.173 --> 01:12:42.114]  Uh, stop with the consensus method.
[01:12:42.154 --> 01:12:45.917]  The consensus method is a filibuster in the sense that it's minority rule.
[01:12:46.357 --> 01:12:51.440]  A small minority can block the entire thing and wreck the entire proceeding, so kick that out.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:58.284]  The American way is, majority rule and the rights of the minority, of course, to speak, are taken care of.
[01:12:58.604 --> 01:12:59.185]  They remain.
[01:12:59.745 --> 01:13:07.087]  But you're going to need majority rule, and you've got to develop an organic stratum of political leaders that would not be these creepy facilitators.
[01:13:07.127 --> 01:13:22.450]  You saw one of those creeps in action when the Atlanta General Assembly refused to listen to Representative John Lewis, who's a real, authentic veteran hero of the civil rights struggle, and he should have been seen as an emissary of the black community to a mainly white group.
[01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:28.192]  One of the main principles of mass strike organizing is, once you get something going, you've got to spread it.
[01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:29.513]  You've got to bring in new groups.
[01:13:29.633 --> 01:13:35.336]  You've got to, if you're students mainly at the beginning, you've got to get labor, you've got to get blacks, you've got to get Hispanics, you've got to get women.
[01:13:35.596 --> 01:13:39.898]  You've got to get all the main groups in the society, so we're there doing the opposite.
[01:13:40.358 --> 01:13:52.223]  Politically, where do you see this going in terms of top-down Democratic and left-leaning leadership attempting to absorb the energy, whatever they say on the ground, whatever the grassroots protesters are talking about individually?
[01:13:52.586 --> 01:13:53.287]  I say break it.
[01:13:53.427 --> 01:13:54.929]  I say they're very vulnerable.
[01:13:54.949 --> 01:13:59.995]  See, this is exactly when the ruling class is most vulnerable because they've now got masses going in motion.
[01:14:00.175 --> 01:14:00.936]  They did this, right?
[01:14:00.976 --> 01:14:02.077]  They put this on TV.
[01:14:02.537 --> 01:14:08.544]  What I recommend people to do is go to your local Occupy, whatever it is, and these now exist in hundreds and hundreds of cities.
[01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:13.090]  Go in there with some workers, some people who have some sense.
[01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:15.391]  Go in there and stage a coup.
[01:14:15.812 --> 01:14:17.433]  Take over their General Assembly.
[01:14:17.473 --> 01:14:22.316]  Say, look, this straitjacket, this Procrustean bed, if you want, right?
[01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:27.960]  It's the bed where you lie down and if you're too short, they stretch you, and if you're too long, they cut your feet off.
[01:14:29.341 --> 01:14:30.862]  Nobody wants to lie down on this, right?
[01:14:30.902 --> 01:14:33.803]  The American working people don't have time for endless debate.
[01:14:33.864 --> 01:14:34.764]  They need a job.
[01:14:34.824 --> 01:14:35.765]  They need a doctor.
[01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:38.367]  They need to stop a fraud closure on their house.
[01:14:39.907 --> 01:14:42.908]  They need to do something about student loan debt.
[01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:47.169]  So go in there and say, look, we're going back to typical American methods.
[01:14:47.229 --> 01:15:01.694]  The majority rules, kick out the facilitator, have somebody elected chairman who enjoys the confidence of the people based on political criteria, not because they're experts in the stupid anarchist system of Gelderloos.
[01:15:02.474 --> 01:15:08.196]  And that is also the other thing about it is that most of these groups are anarchist anarchoids.
[01:15:09.016 --> 01:15:12.677]  And when you look at them, those are not professional revolutionaries.
[01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:14.118]  They're professional wreckers.
[01:15:14.458 --> 01:15:15.998]  They're professional saboteurs.
[01:15:16.038 --> 01:15:17.059]  They're police agents.
[01:15:17.139 --> 01:15:19.619]  Their task is largely to destroy.
[01:15:19.639 --> 01:15:24.281]  So we have adbusters of Vancouver, British Columbia.
[01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:35.704]  It is a branch of the Situationist International, in effect, which is a group of—goes back to the 1950s—a bunch of washed-up, has-been-never-was artists and writers and so forth.
[01:15:36.204 --> 01:15:44.348]  And they were used by NATO intelligence to overthrow General de Gaulle of France in 1968-70, because that was the main enemy of NATO at the time.
[01:15:44.688 --> 01:15:47.950]  So those methods also live on in this group.
[01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:59.396]  And they're all agreed, when some of these people get on television, they get on network television, they could be saying things like, 1% Wall Street sales tax on all transactions, make Wall Street pay.
[01:16:00.616 --> 01:16:02.398]  Cancel all student loans.
[01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.759]  Wipe out one trillion.
[01:16:04.099 --> 01:16:06.121]  Let the zombie bankers eat the losses.
[01:16:06.201 --> 01:16:07.021]  They were bailed out.
[01:16:07.061 --> 01:16:08.022]  Now let them say thank you.
[01:16:08.062 --> 01:16:15.408]  Well Webster, on another front, the derivatives is something you've been talking about for literally years and years and years being the huge elephant in the room.
[01:16:15.428 --> 01:16:25.696]  And on another front of the same issue, we have Bank of America moving its Merrill Lynch derivatives into the FDIC and open to the Federal Reserve discount.
[01:16:25.716 --> 01:16:26.577]  Have you seen that news?
[01:16:27.079 --> 01:16:37.225]  Well, again, instead of worrying about what the enemy is doing, we've got to figure out what we're doing, and what we should be doing is use the vehicle of these protests.
[01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:42.848]  In other words, if you can go into one of these protests, kick out the facilitator, take over the meeting,
[01:16:43.448 --> 01:16:44.849]  Vote up a series of demands.
[01:16:44.909 --> 01:17:10.249]  And again, I just cancel student loans, 1% Wall Street sales tax, stop all foreclosures, foreclosures for 5 years, no cuts in the social safety net, no genocide against the American people, nationalize the Federal Reserve, go for blocks of 1 trillion of 0% federal credit with maturities of 50 to 100 years, rebuild the country, road, rail, water, energy, public buildings, schools, hospitals, and the entire thing.
[01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:12.851]  We're good to go.
[01:17:40.692 --> 01:17:44.234]  Yeah, I'm sure that's true, but I want to know what you have to say about the derivatives.
[01:17:45.034 --> 01:17:48.716]  I say, ban some, tax the rest.
[01:17:48.856 --> 01:17:50.997]  Get them out of existence.
[01:17:51.017 --> 01:17:53.198]  This is precisely where the depression comes from.
[01:17:53.598 --> 01:17:56.219]  Under the New Deal, derivatives were illegal.
[01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:57.279]  They were banned.
[01:17:57.619 --> 01:17:59.200]  They were Leavenworth material.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:05.383]  From 1936 to 1982, under the Commodity Exchange Act, they were simply illegal.
[01:18:05.903 --> 01:18:12.127]  Reagan, under, you know, Milton Friedman and Austrian auspices, said, let's bring them back.
[01:18:12.167 --> 01:18:13.968]  They were so smelly it took 20 years.
[01:18:14.028 --> 01:18:17.850]  The job was completed by Clinton and Rubin.
[01:18:18.271 --> 01:18:23.974]  And that is the 1.5 quadrillion to 2 quadrillion that's crushing the world economy.
[01:18:24.014 --> 01:18:24.735]  Well, what do you do?
[01:18:25.195 --> 01:18:27.676]  We just had a deal today, right, on Citibank.
[01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:31.859]  Citibank has to pay $285 million, which is a tap on the wrist.
[01:18:32.586 --> 01:18:35.630]  For their collateralized debt obligations.
[01:18:36.491 --> 01:18:47.524]  The two kinds of derivatives that have played the biggest role in this depression are the collateralized debt obligations, where the news guys this morning, they were saying, well, they said it was dog doo doo.
[01:18:47.824 --> 01:18:48.045]  Yeah.
[01:18:48.545 --> 01:18:52.287]  To the people who were making them up, selling them, and then shorting them.
[01:18:52.707 --> 01:18:55.969]  All right, so let's ban collateralized debt obligations.
[01:18:56.129 --> 01:19:01.832]  Even Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, when he testified in Congress last May, said, maybe we shouldn't have them.
[01:19:01.892 --> 01:19:02.753]  Yeah, you shouldn't have them.
[01:19:02.813 --> 01:19:03.233]  Ban them.
[01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:06.315]  The other one, of course, is credit default swaps.
[01:19:06.735 --> 01:19:11.517]  That is what is being used to create the European debt crisis and make it much, much worse.
[01:19:11.557 --> 01:19:15.139]  So ban those two kinds, and all others fall under the 1%
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.643]  Uh, Wall Street sales tax, Tobin tax.
[01:19:19.043 --> 01:19:19.744]  Very important.
[01:19:19.804 --> 01:19:30.215]  The Nurses Union, National Nurses United, stands out as the best union in the United States because they're in all of these protests saying, tax Wall Street transactions.
[01:19:30.595 --> 01:19:31.536]  Those are the nurses.
[01:19:31.876 --> 01:19:37.963]  They fought the reactionary Schwarzenegger to a standstill in California, and now they're out there
[01:19:38.083 --> 01:19:39.323]  Alright, Webster, we're coming back.
[01:19:39.523 --> 01:19:40.484]  We're coming up on the break.
[01:19:40.524 --> 01:19:41.864]  We'll be back on the other side.
[01:19:41.924 --> 01:19:51.366]  We want to also get into the provocations for war with Iran, what's going on there, and what's going on with the latest African invasions in Uganda and other countries.

[01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:50.150]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:51.731]  The war is here.
[01:21:52.051 --> 01:21:53.451]  It's an info war.
[01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:56.473]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:03.957]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:22:04.197 --> 01:22:05.157]  Are you gaining fat?
[01:22:05.297 --> 01:22:06.098]  Feeling tired?

[01:24:13.024 --> 01:24:15.046]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:15.127 --> 01:24:16.488]  Wednesday, October 19, 2011.
[01:24:17.129 --> 01:24:20.212]  We're on with Dr. Webster Tarpley.
[01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:23.176]  Webster, we talked about the Occupy issues.
[01:24:23.216 --> 01:24:29.944]  I want to talk now about the beating the drums for war with Iran.
[01:24:30.504 --> 01:24:31.546]  We've seen this phony
[01:24:32.426 --> 01:24:39.570]  Uh, in my opinion, phony assassination plot cooked up, and now we see the usual suspects trying to take us into war.
[01:24:39.650 --> 01:24:42.892]  William Crystal, among others, trying to pressure Obama.
[01:24:43.072 --> 01:24:44.213]  Uh, what do you see on that front?
[01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:46.454]  Well, let's look at where this story comes from.
[01:24:46.594 --> 01:24:50.356]  You're, first of all, you're very right to say this is, this is a complete farce, right?
[01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:55.279]  This is scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of the scenario department on this one, right?
[01:24:55.479 --> 01:24:58.280]  Uh, this character, Arbopsiar, right?
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.641]  The failed used car dealer.
[01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.042]  He's a, he's a drunk.
[01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.263]  He's a substance abuser.
[01:25:03.283 --> 01:25:04.725]  He's not very bright.
[01:25:04.785 --> 01:25:09.989]  I think he's mentally impaired, either because of too much narcotics or whatever it is.
[01:25:10.009 --> 01:25:17.494]  So the idea is you go to this group in Mexico, which is obviously a battleground of every spook agency in the world, right?
[01:25:17.534 --> 01:25:19.016]  Los Zetas, I guess it is.
[01:25:19.516 --> 01:25:21.097]  And you try to recruit somebody there.
[01:25:21.878 --> 01:25:25.060]  Again, this is not how anybody would do these things.
[01:25:26.241 --> 01:25:27.882]  Even as the Iranians say themselves, right?
[01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:28.542]  What's the point?
[01:25:28.943 --> 01:25:33.746]  Why go to Washington to do this when it's so much easier to do something similar somewhere else?
[01:25:33.806 --> 01:25:35.707]  And what are you gaining anyway?
[01:25:35.847 --> 01:25:38.428]  Acting out your rage or whatever it is, right?
[01:25:38.448 --> 01:25:40.370]  The Iran Revolutionary Guard are very...
[01:25:41.425 --> 01:25:46.308]  Professional group, and obviously this is not, this is anything but professional.
[01:25:46.328 --> 01:25:50.050]  But now let's see where this is coming from, because I've heard some funny stories about this.
[01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:52.691]  Who is running the US government right now?
[01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:54.112]  I don't think it's Obama, right?
[01:25:54.132 --> 01:26:04.698]  The reports we're getting from all kinds of sources, the infamous Ulster Man, or indeed the Washington Post of a week ago, Saturday, that Obama is increasingly withdrawn, right?
[01:26:04.718 --> 01:26:05.058]  He's like,
[01:26:05.818 --> 01:26:07.539]  Nixon may be paranoid, right?
[01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:19.883]  Retreating into the family quarters, watching TV, sports games, not very polite to people who show up, sometimes insults them, maybe hitting the bottle, maybe chain-smoking again, who knows?
[01:26:20.363 --> 01:26:25.145]  But under a lot of anxiety, but he's tending towards
[01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:26.745]  They're dropping out.
[01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:30.967]  He throbs on adulation, and adulation is not so easy to come by now.
[01:26:30.987 --> 01:26:32.487]  So, who's running the government?
[01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.368]  I would say it's the Principals Committee.
[01:26:35.128 --> 01:26:51.953]  The Principals Committee right now is composed of Hillary Clinton, Leon Panetta, now as Secretary of Defense, General David Petraeus of the CIA, Donilon, this is Tom Donilon, the head of the National Security Council, and Eric Holder, this multi-malefactor
[01:26:52.759 --> 01:26:54.240]  Who's the head of the Justice Department.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:01.165]  And if you look at that group, I would say the likely source of this Iranian story is Petraeus.
[01:27:01.245 --> 01:27:03.807]  In other words, the author of this is Petraeus.
[01:27:03.887 --> 01:27:12.973]  Not the civilian government, but Petraeus, who unites now in a personal union, we might say, the Pentagon with the CIA.
[01:27:14.173 --> 01:27:15.614]  And let's just look back.
[01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:18.777]  He came to power in the CIA on September 6th.
[01:27:19.657 --> 01:27:21.599]  And September 6th, what have we had since then?
[01:27:21.619 --> 01:27:26.044]  We've had three big, big false flag type stunts.
[01:27:26.104 --> 01:27:28.627]  We had the special alert over the 9-11 weekend.
[01:27:28.647 --> 01:27:32.471]  If you go back and look, Petraeus arrives at the CIA and the call goes out.
[01:27:32.972 --> 01:27:34.814]  Special alert, I think, two days later.
[01:27:35.274 --> 01:27:43.956]  Then we had this amazing story, which is attributed to the outgoing admiral there at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right?
[01:27:44.016 --> 01:27:45.316]  But it's really Petraeus.
[01:27:45.696 --> 01:27:49.377]  Petraeus is the one who delivered this story to the Pakistanis.
[01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:58.359]  He called in the head of the ISI of Pakistan and said, you are supporting terrorism, you are supporting the Haqqani Network, you're no good.
[01:27:58.399 --> 01:28:03.460]  And that has created a tremendous wave of acrimony, hatred, and possible
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.922]  We're constantly getting stories that there are shooting incidents between U.S.
[01:28:08.962 --> 01:28:13.905]  forces and Pakistani forces on different sides of the Afghani-Pakistan border.
[01:28:14.225 --> 01:28:23.949]  And then, within the first month, still, of his tenure at the CIA, we then get this unbelievable Iran story.
[01:28:23.989 --> 01:28:30.112]  So I would warn, I've heard various people saying, oh, this is the work of bungling civilians.
[01:28:30.892 --> 01:28:34.816]  Uh, and we need somebody like General Petraeus because we're praying that he's competent.
[01:28:34.856 --> 01:28:43.324]  Well, guess again, Petraeus is the number one Bonapartist, and of course what I mean by that is somebody who wants to have a military dictatorship.
[01:28:43.865 --> 01:28:46.727]  Um, the term comes from Napoleon, right?
[01:28:46.907 --> 01:28:51.412]  Coined after Napoleon Bonaparte, a general who becomes a dictator and then much, much more.
[01:28:52.212 --> 01:29:00.538]  Petraeus is, I think, he's up to his neck in this, and I would say, in terms of these personalities, he's probably the dominant one on this Principals Committee.
[01:29:00.578 --> 01:29:16.290]  So there may have already been a coup behind the scenes where they keep Obama as a figurehead, and this Principals Committee runs the government, and Petraeus... Well, think of somebody like Field Marshal von Hindenburg becoming president of Germany after World War I. Very bad results, right?
[01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:18.952]  He was not Hitler, but he brought in Hitler.
[01:29:18.972 --> 01:29:20.573]  So, something like this.
[01:29:20.933 --> 01:29:22.695]  Now, why do they do this now?
[01:29:23.015 --> 01:29:25.257]  Webster, we're going to hold off here.
[01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:28.479]  We're going to keep you to the other side, bring you into the next segment as well.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.421]  Of course, we have other minor events.
[01:29:30.521 --> 01:29:31.862]  Panic on a Texas flight.
[01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:38.387]  As passenger yells, you are all going to die, ala Akbar, apparently an Iranian guy, American-Iranian.
[01:29:38.867 --> 01:29:40.549]  Other Muslims arrested with photos.
[01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:45.375]  We'll get into some of that on the other side and talk more about the CIA secret network.
[01:29:45.415 --> 01:29:45.935]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:46.015 --> 01:29:46.997]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:47.357 --> 01:29:48.699]  Here now with Webster Tarpley.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.861]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.362 --> 01:29:52.963]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.904 --> 01:29:56.567]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.609 --> 01:30:04.832]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.152 --> 01:30:05.753]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.073 --> 01:30:09.215]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.496 --> 01:30:10.056]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.356 --> 01:30:14.900]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:15.680]  It's true.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:20.544]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.864 --> 01:30:21.404]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.685 --> 01:30:24.967]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.267 --> 01:30:28.970]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:29.711]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:32.333]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:36.117]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.418 --> 01:30:36.938]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:41.123]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.363 --> 01:30:46.108]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:22.589 --> 01:31:23.990]  Those poisonous critters can't

[01:31:26.691 --> 01:31:28.871]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.

[01:31:56.458 --> 01:32:02.862]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:03.062 --> 01:32:08.105]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:32:08.385 --> 01:32:09.746]  Saving means to make money.
[01:32:09.906 --> 01:32:18.692]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:32:19.432 --> 01:32:26.534]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:32:26.954 --> 01:32:34.577]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:32:34.957 --> 01:32:42.359]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:33:19.526 --> 01:33:25.247]  Okay, we are back in the long segment of the second hour.
[01:33:25.307 --> 01:33:27.528]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in for Alex again.
[01:33:27.608 --> 01:33:30.708]  He will be back tomorrow, fired up and ready to go.
[01:33:30.808 --> 01:33:39.550]  Right now we are still with Webster Tarpley and we were breaking down the CIA manufactured tensions with Iran.
[01:33:40.150 --> 01:33:42.911]  Webster, where do we go from here with the Iran situation?
[01:33:43.499 --> 01:33:47.586]  Well, I think there are a couple of things working in the background.
[01:33:47.686 --> 01:33:51.493]  One, specifically, this is an attempt to intervene into Iran, right?
[01:33:51.533 --> 01:33:54.078]  There's this ongoing fight between Ahmadinejad
[01:33:55.374 --> 01:34:07.241]  And the president of the country, Khamenei, the head of the mullahs, the spiritual leader, and you can see the U.S.
[01:34:07.301 --> 01:34:09.002]  is trying to intervene in favor of the mullahs.
[01:34:09.062 --> 01:34:10.864]  Hillary Clinton has said this, right?
[01:34:11.084 --> 01:34:13.485]  We want to have an Islamic Republic.
[01:34:13.525 --> 01:34:21.270]  Well, in the sense of a mullahs, they fear and hate Ahmadinejad because he represents the military-industrial complex.
[01:34:21.730 --> 01:34:36.219]  He's a military man, he's a modernizer, he's interested in science, he's interested in scientific research, and all the other things that actually make a country strong, and, indeed, nuclear energy, which is an indispensable part of being a strong, independent country.
[01:34:36.239 --> 01:34:44.223]  So you can see that they're trying to skew the outcome of that in favor of the mullahs and against the president.
[01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:49.026]  The other part of the background is the Anglo-Americans are not happy campers these days.
[01:34:49.086 --> 01:34:50.267]  I think a number of things are going
[01:34:50.367 --> 01:34:51.188]  Very wrong for them.
[01:34:51.668 --> 01:34:53.009]  Number one, Putin is back.
[01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:54.751]  Putin is back stronger than ever.
[01:34:55.071 --> 01:34:55.992]  Medvedev is out.
[01:34:56.473 --> 01:35:02.618]  I think if we'd had Putin here all the time, we probably wouldn't have had the Libya War, at least in the way that it happened.
[01:35:03.079 --> 01:35:06.582]  Putin is not only back, but he's back without Kudrin.
[01:35:06.662 --> 01:35:14.009]  And Kudrin was precisely the free market reformer, the steward of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank.
[01:35:14.589 --> 01:35:17.291]  The European Central Bank and all the rest of them.
[01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:29.719]  So Kudrin, who's really the last of the leftovers from the shock therapy era when the IMF came into Russia and wrecked them using free market deregulation, privatization, union busting, all that stuff.
[01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:30.899]  He's now out.
[01:35:30.999 --> 01:35:35.022]  So Putin is back, cleansed, to some extent at least, of his weakest
[01:35:35.522 --> 01:35:39.405]  The other thing is the destabilization of Syria is going nowhere.
[01:35:39.885 --> 01:35:43.587]  Notice that we had this interesting, I think a good, wonderful moment in the U.N.
[01:35:44.028 --> 01:35:47.890]  when China and Russia voted to veto the U.S.
[01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:53.294]  proposal which was to begin essentially civil war and bombing in Syria.
[01:35:53.494 --> 01:35:55.976]  And that was done, that's thanks to Putin again.
[01:35:56.376 --> 01:36:02.280]  Putin stood up and said no, in effect, and the Chinese then had the guts to do the same thing.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.362]  The other thing is Libya, not going too well, right?
[01:36:05.402 --> 01:36:10.424]  Colonel Gaddafi and his entire family leadership team and so forth, this is all still intact.
[01:36:10.824 --> 01:36:23.731]  It's now been two months since the big NATO attack on Tripoli, and the fighting still goes on in Sirte, in Bani Walid, and in Saba, and other places in the south of Libya.
[01:36:23.751 --> 01:36:30.795]  So there's going to be a long civil war, and these NATO agents, right, the Al-Qaeda terrorist council,
[01:36:31.582 --> 01:36:32.862]  They're fighting among themselves.
[01:36:32.923 --> 01:36:39.505]  One of the top ones, Jabril, Hillary Clinton's boyfriend, says that he's going to quit as soon as they finish the military part.
[01:36:39.525 --> 01:36:41.065]  Well, don't hold your breath on that.
[01:36:41.486 --> 01:36:48.348]  I would like to recommend to people, it's clear now that Obama is a total warmonger, in case there was any doubt about this.
[01:36:48.548 --> 01:36:49.728]  We've got seven wars.
[01:36:50.089 --> 01:36:58.211]  We've got Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Libya, Yemen, and now, as you've said, we've added Uganda, which is really more.
[01:36:58.231 --> 01:36:59.632]  It's Central African Republic.
[01:37:00.052 --> 01:37:02.693]  We're up to 7 wars easily, and maybe 8 or 9.
[01:37:02.973 --> 01:37:05.894]  And the Uganda operation is in 4 different countries, isn't it?
[01:37:05.914 --> 01:37:06.774]  Right, that's what I mean.
[01:37:07.474 --> 01:37:09.855]  In theory, it can expand from there.
[01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:14.936]  So, you know, 7 and counting, or you want to count those 4, I guess we're up to 10.
[01:37:15.376 --> 01:37:17.817]  There may be a cyber war with China, makes it 11.
[01:37:18.237 --> 01:37:26.839]  Look, for people on the center-left of the spectrum, which is about 75% of the United States by most polls in terms of content, what you're for,
[01:37:27.668 --> 01:37:31.033]  PrimaryObamaNow.com.
[01:37:31.073 --> 01:37:34.438]  This is a website where you can go and vote.
[01:37:34.558 --> 01:37:36.241]  You can say, I'm sick of Obama.
[01:37:36.722 --> 01:37:37.743]  I want somebody else.
[01:37:37.843 --> 01:37:38.845]  There's a list of people.
[01:37:39.426 --> 01:37:40.627]  Some of the good ones, right?
[01:37:40.667 --> 01:37:42.951]  Marcy Kaptur in the House of Representatives.
[01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:44.152]  We're good to go.
[01:37:59.504 --> 01:38:01.106]  There's a couple of weeks left, right?
[01:38:01.146 --> 01:38:08.393]  November 1st is the deadline for filing in the Democratic primary in New Hampshire, and other deadlines are now coming up.
[01:38:08.433 --> 01:38:15.440]  So this is basically the last chance to get somebody in the field against this warmonger Obama.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:20.065]  And I would say if the Democratic Party doesn't do that, they may be clinically dead.
[01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:21.126]  That may be the end of them.
[01:38:22.386 --> 01:38:32.752]  But as far as the actual Africa situation, you predicted or outlined which direction so much of this was going to go with the AFRICOM mechanism that was put in place.
[01:38:33.452 --> 01:38:34.873]  Can you break down some of that, Webster?
[01:38:35.133 --> 01:38:44.558]  Well, what I argued in Obama the Postmodern Coup, the making of a Manchurian candidate, published first in April of 2008, in the middle of the primaries.
[01:38:45.402 --> 01:38:51.804]  Was that with Obama, Africa would become a battlefield between the United States and China.
[01:38:51.904 --> 01:38:57.345]  And the idea is always, China is present in these countries because they want oil, raw materials.
[01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:59.546]  They were getting oil from Libya, no more.
[01:38:59.966 --> 01:39:03.187]  They were getting raw materials from Zimbabwe.
[01:39:03.207 --> 01:39:08.048]  They're trying to bring it into that by overthrowing Mugabe on the NATO side.
[01:39:09.048 --> 01:39:15.951]  Gaddafi's big sin, from their point of view, was he was one of the few African countries that refused to become a part of U.S.
[01:39:16.151 --> 01:39:17.411]  African Command, U.S.
[01:39:17.892 --> 01:39:20.553]  AFRICOM, I think still in Stuttgart.
[01:39:20.593 --> 01:39:25.775]  So, when you look at Libya, right, remember that Libya is not just Libya.
[01:39:25.835 --> 01:39:34.458]  Libya was also really the only fairly advanced country, and it was more advanced than many countries in Europe, in Eastern Europe at any rate.
[01:39:35.158 --> 01:39:40.921]  They had development projects going in Mali, in Chad, lots of other places.
[01:39:40.981 --> 01:39:43.963]  A big presence in that belt, the Sahel, right?
[01:39:44.583 --> 01:39:47.684]  On the southern side of the Sahara.
[01:39:48.505 --> 01:39:49.886]  And that's what we're talking about now.
[01:39:49.946 --> 01:39:57.549]  We're talking about Uganda and the Central African Republic and the other ones, including Congo, right?
[01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:59.831]  Congo, well, the big Congo, right?
[01:39:59.871 --> 01:40:00.451]  Not the little one.
[01:40:00.891 --> 01:40:06.974]  So, all of these areas are areas of Chinese commercial penetration.
[01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:16.678]  And since the U.S., under the current economic system, cannot compete in terms of economics, they choose to fall back on military aggression.
[01:40:16.698 --> 01:40:18.359]  And of course, this doesn't work.
[01:40:18.399 --> 01:40:27.883]  The other thing, when you're in Uganda, the specialty of Uganda, as I learned visiting southern Sudan some years ago, that's where you destabilize southern Sudan.
[01:40:28.703 --> 01:40:30.324]  Which has now been detached.
[01:40:31.044 --> 01:40:39.267]  If you saw this character, Pat Buchanan, this reactionary writer, he's been pushing his new book and he says, oh look, all these countries are falling apart.
[01:40:39.647 --> 01:40:40.988]  All these countries are falling apart.
[01:40:41.188 --> 01:40:42.588]  Yeah, who's wrecking them?
[01:40:42.668 --> 01:40:44.089]  Who's tearing them apart?
[01:40:44.489 --> 01:40:53.255]  The US, the British, and the Israelis are the ones who fomented the split of Sudan into two parts, especially the British, who have been trying to do that for 120 years.
[01:40:53.615 --> 01:40:54.395]  They finally did it.
[01:40:54.456 --> 01:40:55.816]  So now there's South Sudan.
[01:40:56.177 --> 01:41:02.761]  So with Uganda as a military base, you can strike right across the border into South Sudan, although they don't mention that one.
[01:41:03.341 --> 01:41:09.064]  Uh, Congo, uh, and then over at Central African Republic, and indeed any others.
[01:41:09.184 --> 01:41:17.147]  Also, you get the idea that Obama, maybe he's, Obama, the regime, is trying to compete with the French, because this is typically a French sphere.
[01:41:17.467 --> 01:41:26.391]  So the idea is that if Qaddafi is, for the moment, focused on the guerrilla war and the civil war in Libya, a space opens up so they want to go in and do that.
[01:41:26.691 --> 01:41:28.812]  Now, of course, this is absolutely insane, right?
[01:41:28.832 --> 01:41:30.593]  This doesn't help the United States.
[01:41:30.673 --> 01:41:31.313]  This is another
[01:41:32.053 --> 01:41:34.175]  Uh, recipe for disaster.
[01:41:34.215 --> 01:41:43.861]  But notice the difference is that Bush would have gone on television with some kind of a blustering, warmonger, brutal, imperialist speech, and Obama basically says nothing.
[01:41:44.262 --> 01:41:45.863]  He pretends it's not happening, right?
[01:41:45.903 --> 01:41:48.905]  It might interfere with his election year demagogy.
[01:41:48.965 --> 01:41:50.426]  So, this is where we are.
[01:41:50.766 --> 01:41:52.828]  And the answer to that, once again, is political.
[01:41:53.048 --> 01:41:54.369]  PrimaryObamaNow.com.
[01:41:55.249 --> 01:41:55.709]  Get him out.
[01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:56.710]  Dump him in 2012.
[01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:58.491]  He is the new Carter.
[01:41:58.732 --> 01:41:59.392]  There's no doubt.
[01:41:59.472 --> 01:42:02.114]  He cratered exactly at the same time as Carter.
[01:42:02.694 --> 01:42:03.715]  30 months into the term.
[01:42:03.775 --> 01:42:10.240]  That was July 1979 for Carter with the Malez speech and firing the cabinet and for Obama it was
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:23.370]  His failure to invoke the 14th Amendment and stop that crazy race to default, which then gave the financiers acting through Standard & Poor's the chance to downgrade the United States.
[01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:26.613]  And those agencies are still on a rampage around the world, right?
[01:42:26.633 --> 01:42:27.413]  They haven't stopped.
[01:42:27.773 --> 01:42:33.358]  And somebody's going to have to let them see the inside of a jail cell in order to stop that.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:42.501]  Does it look to you like they're going to be able to contain these various countries through these smaller coups, or does it look like a wider world war is kicking off?
[01:42:43.382 --> 01:42:48.082]  Will they actually bite off on Iran as they're sort of gearing up to do again, Webster?
[01:42:48.122 --> 01:42:50.243]  Are we going to see another false flag attack?
[01:42:51.803 --> 01:42:53.703]  Look, all of this is possible, right?
[01:42:53.743 --> 01:42:55.564]  You've got to have maximum vigilance on this.
[01:42:55.884 --> 01:43:02.405]  My reading of what they're doing with Iran right now is they're trying to skew this faction fight
[01:43:03.209 --> 01:43:21.907]  In favor of the Supreme Leader and against Ahmadinejad, because Ahmadinejad is the modernizer, the military guy, he's basically a new Nasser, with an overlay of Islamic doctrine, which is sort of what belongs to our times, for good or for ill, there it is.
[01:43:22.467 --> 01:43:24.470]  So, the ones that the U.S.
[01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:29.556]  and the British have always hated and feared are the people in the tradition of Colonel Nasser of Egypt.
[01:43:29.596 --> 01:43:36.524]  That would be, in various ways, right, distorted though they be, the Assad's in Syria, Gaddafi,
[01:43:38.185 --> 01:43:40.107]  You can look at Chavez of Venezuela.
[01:43:40.327 --> 01:43:42.309]  They all start off as colonels, right?
[01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:43.350]  Middle-level officers.
[01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:45.172]  So, Ahmadinejad, the same thing.
[01:43:45.212 --> 01:43:46.153]  They want to get rid of him.
[01:43:46.633 --> 01:43:52.718]  But then, you know, under conditions of a breakdown crisis, things get out of control.
[01:43:52.778 --> 01:43:56.622]  You can look at the border between Turkey and Syria.
[01:43:56.642 --> 01:43:58.884]  There's constant grave danger.
[01:43:59.861 --> 01:44:12.794]  That in order to save the failed Syria destabilization, NATO will finally convince Turkey, or blackmail Turkey, or whatever they do, to cross the border into Syria and help the Democratic Forces.
[01:44:12.854 --> 01:44:17.959]  Now, the Democratic Forces in Syria are the death squads of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:44:17.999 --> 01:44:19.220]  That's who's doing these things.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.180]  These are Al Qaeda terrorists.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:25.261]  These are fighters that have been brought in from Afghanistan and God knows where.
[01:44:25.782 --> 01:44:27.362]  So far, Turkey has not done that.
[01:44:27.482 --> 01:44:35.444]  I think Turkey has just made a move into northern Iraq to fight the Kurds, which I think for them is more realistic.
[01:44:35.844 --> 01:44:46.207]  But if Turkey attacks Syria, that could then blow the lid off the whole thing, because if you attack Syria, it's the same as attacking Iran, and then you get the big regional war.
[01:44:48.107 --> 01:44:58.771]  Then the missiles go up, and I mean, you know, these hundreds and thousands of smaller, conventionally armed ballistic missiles, maybe with various other things on top.
[01:45:01.852 --> 01:45:04.253]  All right, well, thanks for joining us, Webster.
[01:45:04.293 --> 01:45:05.833]  We're going to let you go right now.
[01:45:06.453 --> 01:45:13.836]  And coming up on the other side, we have Alan Watt joining us to give his breakdown of how they steer and control these revolutions.
[01:45:14.436 --> 01:45:17.277]  I just want to mention that Ron Paul has been the one candidate
[01:45:17.697 --> 01:45:21.339]  Uh, willing to bring up that this Iranian assassination plot is false.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:22.941]  I don't know if we have that clip.
[01:45:22.981 --> 01:45:34.608]  He was also in the debates last night, uh, bouting against Herman Cain, uh, total Federal Reserve stooge, about how he's been blaming the victims, saying that, uh, they occupy Wall Street crowd.
[01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:37.950]  Uh, it's their fault if they're not rich.
[01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:41.973]  Instead, Ron Paul says, why don't they direct the protests at the Federal Reserve?
[01:45:41.993 --> 01:45:46.416]  Uh, guys, do we have that clip now of Ron Paul talking about the phony Iranian plot?
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:49.581]  With Wolf Blitzer.
[01:46:10.704 --> 01:46:35.042]  Over three years, but the first year is one trillion balanced budget in three years So cut a trillion the first year first year and you want to do that by eliminating one two, three four five Cabinet positions, right, right The problem we have is I think the radicals have been in charge the people who believe in spending and deficits don't matter and we can be any place in the world and you can print up money forever and They've been doing this for about four years.
[01:46:35.082 --> 01:46:39.406]  So this is an inevitable problem that we have today and yet I think the country
[01:46:40.106 --> 01:46:40.906]  People are waking up.
[01:46:41.207 --> 01:46:47.610]  People in Washington, the bureaucrats and the other politicians, the other candidates running for this office.
[01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:51.772]  I think they're living in a different world.
[01:46:51.812 --> 01:46:53.353]  Because your plan is pretty radical.
[01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:54.133]  Let's take a look at this.
[01:46:54.393 --> 01:46:56.034]  You would cut, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:46:56.314 --> 01:46:58.856]  The Department of Energy, 100,000 jobs right there.
[01:46:59.137 --> 01:47:01.258]  Department of Education, 4,200 jobs.
[01:47:01.559 --> 01:47:03.721]  Department of Commerce, 38,000 jobs.
[01:47:04.041 --> 01:47:06.383]  Department of Interior, 70,000 jobs.
[01:47:06.703 --> 01:47:09.806]  Department of Housing and Urban Development, 9,000 jobs.
[01:47:10.006 --> 01:47:14.610]  That's 221,000 government jobs you would seek to eliminate over three years.
[01:47:14.630 --> 01:47:17.252]  But they're non-productive, so they go back in.
[01:47:17.272 --> 01:47:17.733]  They're not what?
[01:47:17.893 --> 01:47:18.774]  They're non-productive.
[01:47:18.794 --> 01:47:19.114]  Productive.
[01:47:19.134 --> 01:47:21.436]  They're not productive jobs.
[01:47:21.476 --> 01:47:23.558]  These people that work in these jobs, they think they're being productive.
[01:47:23.618 --> 01:47:23.958]  Okay, we'll see.
[01:47:38.575 --> 01:47:46.977]  Stop it right there and that's Ron Paul breaking down his specific economic plan to slash various departments and cut trillions from the budget.
[01:47:47.597 --> 01:47:55.299]  All the other GOP candidates have proposed maybe tens of billions of dollars of cuts at best if they even follow through with those plans.
[01:47:55.979 --> 01:47:59.800]  No one else is even serious here and yet the media of course continues.
[01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:11.088]  To ignore Ron Paul, and another gutsy thing he brought up that I was trying to have them originally cue, we're gonna find that right now, about how the Iranian plot was false, the assassination plot.
[01:48:11.108 --> 01:48:11.688]  Let's cue that up.
[01:48:12.069 --> 01:48:13.150]  Or how there's no evidence for that.
[01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:18.714]  How high, the highest level, they said, was seeking to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington.
[01:48:18.754 --> 01:48:24.638]  If you were president and that report came to you from your CIA, your Justice Department, your FBI, what would you do about that?
[01:48:25.178 --> 01:48:29.320]  I'd check it very carefully for the facts, because now the facts are filtering out.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.581]  They've arrested him, and that's fine.
[01:48:30.601 --> 01:48:32.021]  He could be a very dangerous person.
[01:48:32.321 --> 01:48:37.464]  Maybe he'll get a day in court, but I predict they won't, because I don't think they have much concrete evidence.
[01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:41.045]  At least he's captured, and he's in a court, and they're going to do it.
[01:48:41.065 --> 01:48:48.329]  Why do you think they don't have, because various Republicans and Democrats, Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, you know him.
[01:48:48.549 --> 01:48:51.250]  He believes that the evidence is strong.
[01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:52.351]  Dianne Feinstein, the chair.
[01:48:53.131 --> 01:48:54.532]  I think it's mostly war propaganda.
[01:48:54.552 --> 01:48:57.575]  They've been itching to go to war against Iran for a long, long time.
[01:48:57.815 --> 01:49:02.619]  This is exactly what they did leading up to the war in Iraq, and the danger was not there.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:09.605]  I don't think the Iranians are that stupid, and yet the people here right now are getting pretty excited about it.
[01:49:09.645 --> 01:49:14.430]  You see, people giving us this information gave us Fast and Furious.
[01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:20.335]  They're having investigations into why Fast and Furious is a fraud, but all of a sudden they believe this?
[01:49:20.695 --> 01:49:22.957]  No, the same people are telling the same thing.
[01:49:23.017 --> 01:49:24.498]  They need to look at it very carefully.
[01:49:24.598 --> 01:49:28.040]  As president, I would look at this type of intelligence very carefully.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:31.082]  I certainly wouldn't advocate going into another war.
[01:49:31.162 --> 01:49:36.226]  These people are using this one episode possibility of this one guy doing something.
[01:49:36.406 --> 01:49:37.627]  Was it a sting operation?
[01:49:37.807 --> 01:49:38.247]  We don't know.
[01:49:38.608 --> 01:49:40.969]  People are suggesting we go to war over this.
[01:49:41.029 --> 01:49:42.350]  That is such a careless attitude.
[01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:43.751]  I just want to make sure I heard you right.
[01:49:43.771 --> 01:49:49.135]  You said these allegations are war propaganda on the part of the Obama administration.
[01:49:49.395 --> 01:49:50.236]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:49:50.436 --> 01:49:54.037]  No, the people who are jumping up and down on say, oh, this is wonderful, wonderful.
[01:49:54.337 --> 01:49:55.477]  It's all the way up to the top.
[01:49:55.517 --> 01:50:07.961]  Yes, I think people who are suggesting that this is a. OK, and that is Ron Paul calling out the war propaganda trying to take us into conflict with Iran as those tensions gear up.
[01:50:08.021 --> 01:50:11.662]  He joins all the other intelligence analysis such as Ray McGovern.
[01:50:12.202 --> 01:50:19.466]  Steve Pichesnik and Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, who have all spoken out and called out this plot is totally dubious.
[01:50:19.506 --> 01:50:23.769]  Of course, the papers openly admit it was yet another sting operation.
[01:50:23.809 --> 01:50:25.030]  There's been dozens of them.
[01:50:25.450 --> 01:50:37.317]  All the so-called major Al-Qaeda plots have been nothing more than setups, usually with unwitting dupes, maybe not good people, but certainly not capable of carrying out mass destruction.
[01:50:37.817 --> 01:50:38.838]  Targeting our country.
[01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:51.246]  This is the black ops network trying to drag us deeper down the hole We'll get into that later, and we'll be back in just a few moments with Alan Watt on the other side Alex Jones back tomorrow.
[01:50:51.627 --> 01:50:56.290]  We'll be back after this break stay tuned Infowars.com Infowars nightly news

[01:51:57.973 --> 01:52:02.094]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.134 --> 01:52:07.476]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.716 --> 01:52:12.338]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.738 --> 01:52:15.799]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:16.019 --> 01:52:17.760]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:23.001]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.521 --> 01:52:25.442]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.842 --> 01:52:30.443]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:52:44.987 --> 01:52:47.927]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.427 --> 01:52:50.188]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:00.831 --> 01:53:04.935]  Do you live where ice storms, blizzards, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes occur?
[01:53:05.095 --> 01:53:05.515]  Who doesn't?
[01:53:05.975 --> 01:53:06.976]  Well, most of us do.
[01:53:07.056 --> 01:53:10.379]  And when they occur, one of the first things to happen is the power goes out.
[01:53:10.699 --> 01:53:14.343]  When Hurricane Irene hit, over 5 million homes were without power.
[01:53:14.663 --> 01:53:16.865]  Just having light around the house becomes very important.
[01:53:17.265 --> 01:53:21.230]  Arm yourself the new 50-hour emergency candle in a can.
[01:53:21.591 --> 01:53:22.792]  Just pull the pop-top lid.

[01:53:30.202 --> 01:53:32.465]  Emergency light that has an indefinite shelf life.

[01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:06.067]  We're good.
[01:54:18.823 --> 01:54:22.746]  We are back at InfoWars.com here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:22.826 --> 01:54:24.227]  I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in.
[01:54:24.688 --> 01:54:29.051]  Again, Alex will be back tomorrow with plenty of fresh news ready to go.
[01:54:29.492 --> 01:54:33.255]  He's been out in the field reporting on the border, as you know, throughout the week.
[01:54:33.955 --> 01:54:45.885]  I want to remind everyone that coming up November 3rd, in about two weeks from now, Alex is going to do another marathon 24-hour broadcast for the Money Bomb to help us grow and continue to reach people.
[01:54:45.925 --> 01:54:48.187]  You've seen the InfoWars Nightly News platform.
[01:54:48.747 --> 01:54:50.168]  Getting more and more professional.
[01:54:50.188 --> 01:54:58.513]  We're bringing you condensed news packages and hard-hitting information as well as the guests you're familiar with in a more condensed format.
[01:54:58.953 --> 01:55:02.856]  So look for all that to improve and grow and we do need your support to do that.
[01:55:04.096 --> 01:55:05.177]  A few more headlines.
[01:55:05.277 --> 01:55:09.540]  Kurt Nimmo has written that Occupy Wall Street calls for global governments.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:27.186]  Prior to worldwide Occupy Wall Street inspired protests on October 15th, a group of prominent leftists issued a manifesto that includes a strong call for global democracy and in particular democratic rule over international finance system reports UNPA campaign.
[01:55:27.626 --> 01:55:33.828]  That is the establishment of the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, a global network of parliamentarians.
[01:55:34.548 --> 01:55:36.409]  So there you have people pushing for
[01:55:37.209 --> 01:55:38.991]  Basically greater global governance.
[01:55:39.551 --> 01:55:54.301]  You've had the Soros people not only backing and supporting and sort of steering the Occupy Wall Street crowd but not too long ago converging the Bretton Woods 2 meeting to try to steer which way global finance will go after the next crash.
[01:55:54.922 --> 01:56:06.310]  You've also got Steve Watson expanding on federal records that show Romney campaign is bought and paid for by the big banks that it is Romney this time around who is Wall Street supported
[01:56:06.650 --> 01:56:13.197]  Of course in 2008 it was overwhelmingly Barack Obama and he continues to serve them I'm sure.
[01:56:13.838 --> 01:56:21.967]  I do agree with Webster's analysis that it's basically the shadow networks, the black ops people behind it who are steering Barack Obama.
[01:56:22.407 --> 01:56:24.268]  And plenty of other puppet presidents.
[01:56:24.469 --> 01:56:30.433]  I really personally think that's been going on since the establishment of the National Security Act in 1947.
[01:56:30.933 --> 01:56:37.738]  Truman, the very man who said the buck stops here, certainly did not run things and neither have most of these other presidents.
[01:56:38.198 --> 01:56:45.123]  And you saw what happened to people like JFK and others who stuck their neck out and tried to even fight part of what's going on.
[01:56:46.123 --> 01:56:48.564]  Now we want to talk again about the U.S.
[01:56:48.584 --> 01:56:52.845]  Hawks behind the Iraq War, now rallying for strikes against Iran.
[01:56:53.665 --> 01:57:03.307]  Leading the charge is the foreign policy initiative, the ideological successor to the Project for a New American Century, the familiar players from the Bush administration.
[01:57:03.767 --> 01:57:06.828]  William Kristol, also editor of the Weekly Standard,
[01:57:07.328 --> 01:57:07.528]  Yes.
[01:57:26.377 --> 01:57:26.537]  I think?
[01:57:46.696 --> 01:57:59.046]  The regime's nuclear weapons program, just as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton did respectively in Libya in 1986 and Iraq in 1993, just more alarming news.
[01:57:59.727 --> 01:58:08.414]  And of course we covered earlier something that is now buried in my stack, and that is to do
[01:58:10.711 --> 01:58:12.353]  Well, we'll get to that on the other side.
[01:58:12.493 --> 01:58:20.722]  Alan Watt joining us with his analysis on the Occupy Wall Street movement, the push for Iran, and the larger global system that he covers so well.
[01:58:20.802 --> 01:58:22.504]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com.
[01:58:22.865 --> 01:58:26.028]  And tonight, more special broadcasts on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[01:58:54.878 --> 01:58:55.778]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.158 --> 01:58:59.699]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:59.719 --> 01:59:02.300]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:07.701]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.181 --> 01:59:14.469]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.849 --> 01:59:20.396]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.836 --> 01:59:24.481]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.001 --> 01:59:28.962]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.282 --> 01:59:35.204]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.224 --> 01:59:38.165]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.786 --> 01:59:40.206]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.746 --> 01:59:41.266]  It's here.

[01:59:53.655 --> 01:59:55.596]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.077 --> 01:59:58.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.423 --> 02:00:06.084]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.744 --> 02:00:07.785]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.505 --> 02:00:09.626]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.267 --> 02:00:11.087]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.848 --> 02:00:12.768]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.389 --> 02:00:16.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.592 --> 02:00:21.675]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.959 --> 02:00:33.962]  We are back in the third hour on this October 19, 2011 broadcast.
[02:00:34.022 --> 02:00:37.804]  Again, I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in until Alex is back tomorrow.
[02:00:38.504 --> 02:00:41.066]  But we are now joined by Alan Watt.
[02:00:41.166 --> 02:00:52.392]  He's a long-term researcher of really the true causes behind the various global changes going on and really has a sharp analysis of the unifying agenda behind it all.
[02:00:53.453 --> 02:00:55.555]  He's also a bit of a renaissance man.
[02:00:55.635 --> 02:01:01.342]  He's done music, poetry, philosophy, written books, and many other items.
[02:01:02.323 --> 02:01:05.206]  Alan, thanks for joining us and welcome to the program.
[02:01:05.907 --> 02:01:06.007]  Yes.
[02:01:08.584 --> 02:01:12.845]  Now Alan, we've seen so much happening with the Occupy Wall Street movement itself.
[02:01:13.745 --> 02:01:15.166]  In many ways a diverse group.
[02:01:15.206 --> 02:01:22.308]  We've seen even many protesters targeting the Federal Reserve and other sort of heart of the beast systems.
[02:01:22.348 --> 02:01:31.350]  But at the same time we've seen left-leaning Democratic factions trying to absorb that energy, trying to steer it back into the left-right paradigm of the main establishment.
[02:01:31.810 --> 02:01:33.531]  Just as it happened with the Tea Party.
[02:01:34.311 --> 02:01:44.614]  So we wanted to today really have you break down how they trigger revolutions, how they steer them, how they see them coming, and how they help direct what the eventual outcome will be.
[02:01:44.634 --> 02:01:53.276]  Well, it's all to do with geopolitics and a world agenda, a planned agenda.
[02:01:54.036 --> 02:01:59.558]  Planned a long time ago and many of the big leaders over the years have gone through this agenda.
[02:02:00.325 --> 02:02:02.527]  They have published books on it.
[02:02:04.148 --> 02:02:07.271]  The think tanks, they have openly declared their objectives.
[02:02:08.371 --> 02:02:10.393]  We find that they never sleep, by the way.
[02:02:10.413 --> 02:02:14.236]  They never sleep at 24 hours per day because they have shifts in the big think tanks.
[02:02:14.937 --> 02:02:19.040]  And they work full time on bringing a system of government for the world.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:23.964]  And it's the age, actually, they call this the age of world managers.
[02:02:24.941 --> 02:02:32.643]  And we have been managed for quite some time to privatize everything off in this public-private partnership deal.
[02:02:33.536 --> 02:02:42.299]  And the system we're going into now is the transformation into the culmination of a worldwide system under, really, the United Nations.
[02:02:42.319 --> 02:02:44.119]  And that's what they're calling for now, you'll notice, too.
[02:02:44.139 --> 02:02:57.924]  They're calling for world governance and to be under, and actually officially under, the United Nations, which actually, technically it is, because all laws have been coming through the United Nations for an awful lot of years across the whole world, right down to your building codes.
[02:02:58.824 --> 02:03:03.049]  So, we're simply going through the transformation phases.
[02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:06.293]  Right now, too, it's like wars.
[02:03:06.593 --> 02:03:10.378]  These massive demonstrations have the same effect as a war.
[02:03:10.398 --> 02:03:11.699]  It changes society.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:15.384]  Understand, most of the general public are passive viewers.
[02:03:15.464 --> 02:03:17.046]  They're not participants in anything.
[02:03:18.026 --> 02:03:32.654]  And to change society and to get them to go along with it, you must convince everyone of the necessity of it, either through warfare or because of gross dissatisfaction amongst what appears to be on television massive factions of society.
[02:03:33.234 --> 02:03:36.716]  Because it's them that you have to convince for the changes that are coming in.
[02:03:37.616 --> 02:03:46.679]  Believe you me, this is all part of the soft power technique that Brzezinski and Kissinger and United Nations and many other think tanks have been using for years.
[02:03:47.039 --> 02:03:49.320]  They always start off with soft power.
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:59.303]  They've said that in the Middle East they would use soft power, sometimes increasing into hard military power when required, which we've watched over the last year or two.
[02:04:00.323 --> 02:04:05.885]  So it's our turn now to go through the same transformation into the planned society.
[02:04:05.906 --> 02:04:12.608]  The big bankers at the top, the ones who are international moneylenders, have always used geopolitics.
[02:04:12.648 --> 02:04:14.909]  They don't sit and wait for something to happen in the future.
[02:04:14.929 --> 02:04:16.150]  They plan the future.
[02:04:16.170 --> 02:04:20.492]  And they favor what's called socialism because it's big government.
[02:04:21.212 --> 02:04:23.173]  And big government always borrows from them.
[02:04:24.185 --> 02:04:30.051]  And big government also can keep tabs on the general public and keep them under control when necessary.
[02:04:30.671 --> 02:04:37.177]  The trick in big government is to bring in socialism and make the people think it's actually theirs for the first time.
[02:04:37.938 --> 02:04:40.940]  It's a favor, juster, kinder, etc, etc.
[02:04:41.221 --> 02:04:43.363]  The stuff that Tony Blair used to spout out.
[02:04:43.983 --> 02:04:45.083]  Okay Alan, hold that thought.
[02:04:45.143 --> 02:04:48.384]  We are just getting started on Alan's breakdown.
[02:04:48.424 --> 02:04:50.385]  We'll be back on the other side of the break.
[02:04:50.405 --> 02:04:50.885]  InfoWars.com.
[02:04:50.905 --> 02:04:51.525]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:06.681]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.922 --> 02:05:12.703]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:13.063 --> 02:05:19.865]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:21.785 --> 02:05:24.086]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:25.846 --> 02:05:27.987]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:30.271 --> 02:05:34.174]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:05:34.874 --> 02:05:37.956]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:05:38.717 --> 02:05:39.477]  Others don't.
[02:05:39.957 --> 02:05:41.839]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:42.079 --> 02:05:43.600]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:46.441]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.762 --> 02:05:53.006]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.386 --> 02:05:55.607]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:56.088 --> 02:05:58.129]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:05:58.449 --> 02:05:59.330]  Others don't.
[02:06:00.563 --> 02:06:02.665]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[02:06:03.085 --> 02:06:15.136]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoods Direct, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[02:06:15.356 --> 02:06:23.643]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella, those poisonous critters?
[02:06:23.663 --> 02:06:24.363]  We're good to go!
[02:06:58.273 --> 02:07:15.804]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:07:16.784 --> 02:07:20.467]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:21.485 --> 02:07:33.478]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:07:34.239 --> 02:07:41.527]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:07:42.188 --> 02:07:51.795]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:07:52.575 --> 02:07:55.837]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:07:56.498 --> 02:07:59.680]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:01.241 --> 02:08:06.745]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:34.288]  Okay, we are back on the Alex Jones Show again.
[02:08:34.348 --> 02:08:37.793]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in until Alex is back tomorrow.
[02:08:37.813 --> 02:08:42.299]  I just want to remind you about the InfoWars Nightly News coming up at 7 p.m.
[02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:42.740]  tonight.
[02:08:43.161 --> 02:08:46.446]  We're gonna break down some of the suppressed cancer cures.
[02:08:47.467 --> 02:08:51.029]  And some of the hospitals that are carrying them out rather than chemotherapy.
[02:08:51.349 --> 02:08:55.713]  We're going to cover debate highlights and many other items from the breaking news.
[02:08:55.773 --> 02:09:02.778]  But right now we are joined by Alan Watt, really one of the most well-researched and deeply understood
[02:09:04.179 --> 02:09:11.521]  People who have analyzed what's going on in the global system behind what seems to be unrelated events going on in the world.
[02:09:11.881 --> 02:09:14.301]  Now, Alan, we have the planned economic crisis.
[02:09:14.681 --> 02:09:15.641]  They knew it was coming.
[02:09:16.082 --> 02:09:19.422]  They hedged their bets against it after abusing the system for decades.
[02:09:19.862 --> 02:09:27.664]  And now there's sort of this righteous anger that's brewed up, first in the Middle East, in various parts of Europe, and now it's hitting home in America.
[02:09:28.244 --> 02:09:31.705]  Help us understand what has been going on behind the scenes of all this.
[02:09:33.029 --> 02:09:45.299]  Well, what you've had for years, actually, under the guise of, again, public-private partnerships, are really just a monopoly, a conglomerate of people into energy, taking the energy resources of the world.
[02:09:45.319 --> 02:09:56.928]  Now, remember, too, the Council on Foreign Relations, for an example, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs had their roots in the Milner Group, it was called at the time, International Financiers.
[02:09:56.948 --> 02:10:00.511]  These guys lent to nations, and they created this organisation.
[02:10:01.031 --> 02:10:20.298]  And your plan was to take over all the resources of the world, all energy, all resources, food, water, and everything you need to live, basically, and bring in a planned world system, an economy which would be worldwide, using a socialist-type system to control the populace of the entire globe.
[02:10:20.911 --> 02:10:24.012]  These are the guys who designed the free trade deals.
[02:10:24.112 --> 02:10:26.293]  They wanted all the buyers brought down.
[02:10:26.693 --> 02:10:33.875]  Of course, they wouldn't lose money for the nations in the meantime, because they would replace it with a value-added tax, or in the case of Canada, a general sales tax.
[02:10:34.656 --> 02:10:38.517]  And at the same time, they would do away with borders gradually.
[02:10:39.241 --> 02:10:39.441]  I don't
[02:10:55.192 --> 02:10:55.633]  I don't know.
[02:11:11.628 --> 02:11:13.689]  That ties in with the educational system.
[02:11:14.349 --> 02:11:23.972]  The Frankfurt School, John Dewey, John Dewey said eventually will eradicate all conflicting history where people have had old grievances with neighbours etc.
[02:11:24.252 --> 02:11:27.633]  That's already been done actually under the European Union.
[02:11:27.653 --> 02:11:31.414]  They're eliminating history prior to World War One basically.
[02:11:32.294 --> 02:11:33.876]  We're good to go.
[02:11:54.426 --> 02:12:13.376]  Parts of the resources, the gas, Uganda for instance is one of the world's largest oil, untapped oil fields underneath there, plus cobalt and gas, natural gas as well, which they want for this East African federation and that's why that's so strategically important to get in there and get them conquered as well.
[02:12:13.836 --> 02:12:19.359]  So it's all about resources because these points, the top plan, this world's
[02:12:19.839 --> 02:12:20.780]  We're good to go.
[02:12:35.374 --> 02:12:36.655]  Um, etc.
[02:12:36.875 --> 02:12:45.738]  And also they want to plan you from birth to death, what you will do, what you'll work at, to be tested scientifically for your abilities, and to be schooled to work only more perfected.
[02:12:46.078 --> 02:12:55.601]  It's a more perfected version of the laboratory that was the Soviet Union, which they also funded the same big international organizations.
[02:12:56.221 --> 02:13:03.643]  So we're going through the same thing here, and they must convince the Americans at home that it's necessary that we have this particular change.
[02:13:04.043 --> 02:13:14.026]  And that's what the hype was about in the last century in academia, because academia was brought on board very early on, the Council on Foreign Relations,
[02:13:14.946 --> 02:13:22.368]  Lord Bertrand Russell, all the big boys who help plan this present time we're living in right now, and the cultures that we're going through, the changes.
[02:13:22.848 --> 02:13:28.109]  These guys said we bring academia on board because they will train the future world managers.
[02:13:28.269 --> 02:13:34.790]  So forget the ones beneath them, the working class, go for the managerial classes and you'll be on board with us.
[02:13:35.110 --> 02:13:41.371]  Well they've done that in academia, in cahoots with this new expert driven world governance.
[02:13:41.752 --> 02:13:43.972]  We'll run your life in a scientific fashion.
[02:13:44.392 --> 02:13:53.441]  A scientific dictatorship, actually, was called by the first United Nations UNESCO CEO, and that was Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley.
[02:13:53.881 --> 02:13:59.126]  So this is what we're going through now, the big changes towards their goal into a planned economy.
[02:13:59.706 --> 02:14:06.653]  And they're even using energy, which was planned back in the 1920s, 1930s, under Technocracy Inc.
[02:14:06.693 --> 02:14:07.814]  It was a new theory
[02:14:08.314 --> 02:14:09.015]  We're good to go.
[02:14:23.770 --> 02:14:26.072]  And eventually they'd be replaced by energy units.
[02:14:26.112 --> 02:14:34.879]  Well, we have carbon taxes, carbon units coming in right now, and eventually it will be how much it costs in energy units to keep you as an individual alive.
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:45.588]  So this is the actual whole conglomerate of the Fabian Society, which was just a left-wing part of their own history of international affairs, backed by multi-billionaires.
[02:14:45.608 --> 02:14:48.391]  I mean, they asked their family help to kick it off and fund it.
[02:14:50.855 --> 02:14:58.959]  The big bankers, of course, creating the Royal Institute for International Affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations, and they have branches across the entire planet.
[02:14:59.019 --> 02:15:05.022]  And George Soros, in fact, is the CEO of the European Parliament Group.
[02:15:05.722 --> 02:15:06.642]  He's the head of that.
[02:15:07.002 --> 02:15:08.903]  So it's the same organization across the world.
[02:15:08.963 --> 02:15:14.546]  You've got them in India, in Africa, Australia, all the British Commonwealth countries have their memberships.
[02:15:15.187 --> 02:15:18.938]  And this is the planned system that's taken over a hundred years to achieve.
[02:15:19.259 --> 02:15:21.244]  We're going through parts of the stages right now.
[02:15:22.196 --> 02:15:23.477]  Yeah, I really had to back you up.
[02:15:23.537 --> 02:15:35.708]  When you trace the history of anyone, for example, the Rockefeller Foundation, it's hard to find where they deviate from that Cecil Rhodes Roundtable group that have steered off into so many of the entities you mentioned.
[02:15:36.288 --> 02:15:45.597]  But help bring us up to speed of how they saw the current revolutions coming and how they've prepared for it and where they plan to take it as part of their larger world government takeover.
[02:15:45.617 --> 02:15:49.140]  Well, number one, they always know there's going to be a backlash.
[02:15:50.081 --> 02:15:51.323]  Whenever they do something.
[02:15:51.423 --> 02:15:52.144]  But it's a plan.
[02:15:52.184 --> 02:15:53.025]  It's a cooperation.
[02:15:53.065 --> 02:15:55.188]  I call it cooperation and backlash.
[02:15:55.669 --> 02:16:00.535]  Because remember these guys run the big far-left groups.
[02:16:00.595 --> 02:16:01.657]  They run and finance them.
[02:16:01.797 --> 02:16:04.921]  In fact, your own governments have been financing them for the last 50 years.
[02:16:05.782 --> 02:16:06.803]  The same organizations.
[02:16:07.484 --> 02:16:08.204]  We're good to go.
[02:16:24.930 --> 02:16:32.894]  It's about a fairer globalism and a world governance under the United Nations for all workers of the world etc etc.
[02:16:34.095 --> 02:16:43.540]  I understand to the strategy of their owners because those who own the world basically must keep their working classes under control and make them think they're going to get something out of this.
[02:16:44.750 --> 02:16:53.262]  Uh, but just like the Soviet system, they always make sure that you think you're gonna get something out of it for yourselves, a juster, fairer, kinder society.
[02:16:53.983 --> 02:16:57.768]  But in reality, the world is planned to go under communitarianism.
[02:16:57.829 --> 02:16:59.371]  Britain is the flagship, as you know.
[02:17:00.787 --> 02:17:08.734]  You have these NGOs already created that are coming in and just appointing themselves as leaders of your communities.
[02:17:09.514 --> 02:17:13.898]  One's for energy consumption, one's for wastage disposal.
[02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:18.162]  You've got NGO leaders for your environment, for your area.
[02:17:18.182 --> 02:17:20.944]  They just happen to be there, they're already trained.
[02:17:21.645 --> 02:17:25.689]  And this is the perfect Soviet, Soviet-met rule by councils.
[02:17:26.289 --> 02:17:43.386]  And councils in the Soviet Union were non-governmental organizations and of course their leaders were appointed by the KGB and the Parliamentary Bureau and in the West they're appointed again by the shadow government as you may call it that.
[02:17:43.786 --> 02:17:48.631]  So it's the same system only more perfected and that's what they're actually calling it in some quarters.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:51.601]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:17:51.621 --> 02:17:56.665]  And the same group that creates the crisis, of course, typically brings the solution.
[02:17:56.705 --> 02:17:58.847]  That's the whole formula at hand.
[02:18:00.768 --> 02:18:10.837]  So how do they, how do they predict the timing of these kind of, they see these revolutions coming and happen with the Arab Spring, but they know, we know it was something they were developing for years, Alan.
[02:18:11.738 --> 02:18:13.239]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:18:13.259 --> 02:18:15.441]  They've been working on Africa for an awful long time.
[02:18:16.482 --> 02:18:16.882]  And, um,
[02:18:17.638 --> 02:18:28.666]  Mandela's in it too, he's part of, he wants an African Union and of course what they've really decided to do is initially started off with regional parts of Africa, unions for each one of them.
[02:18:29.006 --> 02:18:37.492]  The United Nations is heavily involved, in fact all of the Western Councillors and bureaucracies are heavily involved too, setting up new State Departments, heavily involved too.
[02:18:38.072 --> 02:18:42.155]  So they want these regions and it's all again to do with free trade
[02:18:43.035 --> 02:18:55.424]  Allowing the big megacorporations in to take control of all energy and mineral resources, everything they can get out of those countries, under the guise of sharing it to the world, the wealth of the world, etc.
[02:18:55.725 --> 02:19:05.832]  Then release it, softly pass through the masters of the world, who already own the wealth of the world, and really consolidate their power over all goods, etc., all necessities of life.
[02:19:06.676 --> 02:19:17.688]  And all they had to do in the meantime is knock down the petty dictators they've already put in for a certain phase, who've now set their purpose and are getting too comfortable in their seats.
[02:19:17.728 --> 02:19:26.218]  They don't really want to part and leave the throne and into a more open society, so they'd simply get rid of them instead.
[02:19:27.359 --> 02:19:32.328]  Actually, wars are very, very good for that because they can accomplish so much in time of war.
[02:19:32.849 --> 02:19:37.296]  But when you go into the Middle Eastern situation, it was very interesting that years ago Kissinger
[02:19:38.064 --> 02:19:40.365]  Kissinger and Brzezinski when they were asked their opinion.
[02:19:40.625 --> 02:19:42.105]  Kissinger and Brzezinski, Alan.
[02:19:42.266 --> 02:19:44.946]  We've got to hit that when we get on the other side of this break.
[02:19:44.986 --> 02:19:46.647]  We're being cut off again by that.
[02:19:46.987 --> 02:19:51.209]  But we're going to get into the war, the agendas, and where things are going from here.
[02:19:51.269 --> 02:19:51.829]  Stay tuned.

[02:19:53.169 --> 02:19:55.890]  Alan Watt riding with us until the end of this hour.
[02:20:01.331 --> 02:20:02.951]  Take the first step in home security.
[02:20:03.151 --> 02:20:04.392]  Install the Door Sentinel.
[02:20:04.552 --> 02:20:07.873]  Standard locks, deadbolts, and security systems can't prevent forced entry.
[02:20:07.993 --> 02:20:12.334]  The Door Sentinel provides door kick-in protection and can be added to your existing security system.
[02:20:12.454 --> 02:20:15.995]  The Door Sentinel is easy to install and will turn your home into a fortress.
[02:20:16.155 --> 02:20:16.695]  Make the call.
[02:20:16.715 --> 02:20:16.755]  678-648-6757.
[02:20:16.955 --> 02:20:17.335]  That's 678-648-6757.

[02:20:30.638 --> 02:20:39.904]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:39.944 --> 02:20:40.685]  This capitalism?
[02:20:40.745 --> 02:20:46.889]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:47.029 --> 02:20:47.790]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:50.912]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:20:50.972 --> 02:20:51.872]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:20:51.892 --> 02:20:52.953]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:20:52.993 --> 02:20:53.593]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:53.633 --> 02:20:53.914]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:00.778 --> 02:21:04.819]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:21:05.239 --> 02:21:06.440]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:15.182]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:21:15.622 --> 02:21:18.823]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:21:19.063 --> 02:21:19.943]  But take heart.
[02:21:20.103 --> 02:21:23.624]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:21:23.905 --> 02:21:28.886]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:21:29.306 --> 02:21:32.848]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:21:33.148 --> 02:21:34.589]  The globalists are scared.
[02:21:34.869 --> 02:21:35.870]  They've overreached.
[02:21:36.210 --> 02:21:39.332]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:21:55.102 --> 02:21:57.203]  We are going to use their system against them.
[02:21:57.363 --> 02:22:00.384]  The info war now goes into high gear!
[02:22:00.625 --> 02:22:04.867]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:22:05.187 --> 02:22:05.787]  Number one.
[02:22:06.087 --> 02:22:09.249]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:22:09.509 --> 02:22:10.089]  Number two.
[02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:14.931]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:22:15.271 --> 02:22:15.712]  It's true.
[02:22:16.012 --> 02:22:20.554]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:22:20.874 --> 02:22:21.414]  Number 3.
[02:22:21.694 --> 02:22:24.975]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:22:25.276 --> 02:22:28.997]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:22:29.197 --> 02:22:29.757]  Number 4.
[02:22:29.997 --> 02:22:32.358]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:22:32.758 --> 02:22:36.139]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:36.640]  Number 5.
[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:41.141]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:22:41.361 --> 02:22:46.123]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:22:46.423 --> 02:22:50.447]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:23:24.954 --> 02:23:31.497]  A water secret so powerful, some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[02:23:32.017 --> 02:23:40.822]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, and even mercury and remove these accumulated poisons from your body and your drinking water.
[02:23:41.282 --> 02:23:47.925]  You can take your water freedom into your own hands and defend yourself and your family from the globalist health agenda.

[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:24.722]  Alan Watt is our guest here in the third hour.
[02:24:24.742 --> 02:24:31.227]  I am Aaron Dyke sitting in until Alex returns tomorrow with a powerful broadcast.
[02:24:31.347 --> 02:24:34.209]  But you also want to check out the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:24:34.229 --> 02:24:37.071]  Again, tonight we have some very special reports prepared.
[02:24:37.811 --> 02:24:43.715]  But Alan, you were just getting into some of the factors in the Middle East, bringing up Brzezinski and Kissinger.
[02:24:44.315 --> 02:24:45.196]  If you could please continue.
[02:24:46.236 --> 02:24:50.138]  Yeah, the agenda for the Middle East was complete destabilization.
[02:24:50.158 --> 02:24:52.858]  They wanted to destabilize the countries.
[02:24:52.878 --> 02:24:57.300]  It makes it easier for the big boys to go in, which they did, of course.
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:05.782]  Smash the infrastructure, get the taxpayers of America and Britain and elsewhere to build brand new refineries.
[02:25:05.802 --> 02:25:07.543]  Said the old ones were inadequate.
[02:25:08.283 --> 02:25:09.003]  And we did.
[02:25:09.023 --> 02:25:10.244]  And then they auctioned them off.
[02:25:10.324 --> 02:25:12.405]  Actually, they gave them away to the big corporations.
[02:25:12.445 --> 02:25:13.785]  That was published and mainstream.
[02:25:14.657 --> 02:25:28.802]  So, it's much easier to have control in an area when technically it's destabilized because you can bribe the local gangs that form or sides that form when you break up, especially Muslims, against different sections, different factions.
[02:25:29.563 --> 02:25:32.924]  And that's exactly what Kissinger and Brzezinski
[02:25:32.964 --> 02:25:33.664]  We're good to go.
[02:25:57.609 --> 02:26:03.754]  And also, too, they've actually said that in the Council on Foreign Relations they must keep that whole region safe for Israel.
[02:26:03.774 --> 02:26:05.035]  That's a big, big part of it.
[02:26:05.675 --> 02:26:08.157]  It's out in the open to keep it safe for Israel.
[02:26:08.377 --> 02:26:10.399]  There would be no other superpower in that area.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.921]  And we see the same thing with Egypt.
[02:26:13.001 --> 02:26:19.126]  One of the Prime Ministers of Israel said years ago, he said, if we can get Egypt, then that's the jewel.
[02:26:20.127 --> 02:26:21.908]  That's the jewel that they were after.
[02:26:21.928 --> 02:26:24.370]  That would be the jewel in their crown, basically, getting Egypt.
[02:26:24.850 --> 02:26:27.292]  Control of each very strategic point for them as well.
[02:26:27.973 --> 02:26:36.739]  And so they've achieved goal after goal after goal with cooperation from the US and the military doing all the work and paying all the cash for it, basically.
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:48.668]  So there's different geopolitical strategy, but the main thing is to keep them destabilized for an awful long time to come, almost into a third world status in many cases.
[02:26:49.209 --> 02:26:50.750]  And that's what we see happening right now.
[02:26:51.820 --> 02:27:08.466]  Yeah, and obviously for a power that doesn't belong in the region to project its force, you have to kind of implement destabilization, get the different factions fighting with each other, otherwise they'll have too much stability, and then you can't interject with the various energy powers, as you say, and the rest of it.
[02:27:09.161 --> 02:27:24.577]  Yes, and it's a very old policy and tactic because Britain was using the exact same tactic when India was a conglomeration of small princedoms basically and Britain united it by getting all the factions fighting each other for a long time.
[02:27:25.437 --> 02:27:30.020]  Well they did that in so many places for so many hundreds of years they coined it the grey game.
[02:27:52.799 --> 02:27:56.340]  It's all technique, it's well understood, and they finance all sides.
[02:27:57.220 --> 02:28:17.946]  The problem in a moneyed system is that you can always get people within any faction, any group, to turn on their own people and be a spy or a provocateur, and therefore you can always funnel money into the sides that are fighting each other, but only to a few people who are in the know, who keep it all going, and that's what they're doing.
[02:28:19.116 --> 02:28:27.332]  Yeah, and obviously it's far too easy to buy out a leader at the top, although we seem to fall for it time and again, regardless of country or context.
[02:28:27.893 --> 02:28:28.074]  Yes.
[02:28:30.069 --> 02:28:30.269]  Yeah.
[02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:39.176]  So on the other side, we want to get into the Iranian war, where things are headed with all the provocations and so many of the other events that are going on.
[02:28:39.196 --> 02:28:43.139]  I also want to bring up some of Brzezinski's book, Between Two Ages.
[02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:55.329]  He really talks about how under the emerging global government, you have the illusion that states are the real players, but really it's multi-million dollar international corporations, the banks and the other interests behind it.
[02:28:55.769 --> 02:29:01.713]  He talks about how even organized crime becomes part of the system because it's preferable to chaos.
[02:29:02.173 --> 02:29:09.097]  And he also talks about how third world conflict is just routine, really, to be expected part of the larger development, Alan.
[02:29:09.678 --> 02:29:11.579]  I'm sure you could speak to that as well.
[02:29:12.119 --> 02:29:14.581]  And so we're coming up on the break in just a moment.
[02:29:15.281 --> 02:29:24.387]  And I just want to remind you once again about the InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight and every weekday, as well as the Money Bomb coming up in about two weeks.
[02:29:24.967 --> 02:29:26.889]  On November 3rd, we need your support.
[02:29:27.209 --> 02:29:29.210]  Let's get the word out and let's turn things around.
[02:29:29.571 --> 02:29:30.191]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:30.311 --> 02:29:32.833]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:33.314 --> 02:29:34.855]  Alex Jones returns tomorrow.
[02:29:50.026 --> 02:29:50.947]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.407 --> 02:29:52.928]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:30:06.268]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:30:06.669 --> 02:30:12.533]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:30:13.093 --> 02:30:14.854]  Number one, study the past.
[02:30:15.374 --> 02:30:17.136]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:30:17.776 --> 02:30:21.499]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:30:22.614 --> 02:30:24.876]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:30:25.697 --> 02:30:28.979]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:34.284]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:30:34.584 --> 02:30:38.007]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:30:38.587 --> 02:30:41.448]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:30:41.988 --> 02:30:45.970]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:50.732]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:30:51.412 --> 02:30:55.534]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:56.034 --> 02:30:58.215]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:01.348 --> 02:31:02.829]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:03.049 --> 02:31:08.091]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:31:08.371 --> 02:31:09.731]  Saving means to make money.
[02:31:09.891 --> 02:31:18.675]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:31:19.415 --> 02:31:26.517]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:31:26.957 --> 02:31:34.560]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:39.881]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:31:40.181 --> 02:31:42.342]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:31:45.123 --> 02:31:48.046]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:31:48.326 --> 02:31:50.628]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:31:50.648 --> 02:31:52.830]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:31:59.992 --> 02:32:01.153]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:01.173 --> 02:32:07.837]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.097 --> 02:32:10.398]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:10.659 --> 02:32:15.862]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.042 --> 02:32:18.823]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.084 --> 02:32:21.145]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:21.385 --> 02:32:27.309]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:30.852]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.012 --> 02:32:36.556]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:36.817 --> 02:32:38.118]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:38.438 --> 02:32:39.659]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:39.739 --> 02:32:42.301]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:42.421 --> 02:32:46.464]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:46.644 --> 02:32:48.686]  You can find the video at www.
[02:32:49.346 --> 02:32:53.630]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:53.650 --> 02:32:56.312]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:33:23.618 --> 02:33:26.059]  We are back once again at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:26.139 --> 02:33:28.939]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in until Alex is back tomorrow.
[02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.360]  Our guest is still Alan Watt.
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:33.080]  He joins us for the rest of the hour.
[02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:37.202]  A long-term researcher into their long-term strategy.
[02:33:37.662 --> 02:33:40.863]  Long as in 50, 100 year and even longer intervals.
[02:33:41.303 --> 02:33:43.243]  But we also want to talk about current events.
[02:33:43.623 --> 02:33:46.264]  Where the current Occupy Wall Street movement is going.
[02:33:46.784 --> 02:33:49.905]  And what kind of legislation will be piggybacked on their energy?
[02:34:05.171 --> 02:34:16.409]  For the multi-million dollar international corporations, major banks, financial institutions, and the rest of it, as Brzezinski puts it in his 1970s Between Two Ages book.
[02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:18.592]  Alan, can you speak to those issues?
[02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:22.253]  Yeah, and we see this is actually what's happening right now.
[02:34:22.293 --> 02:34:36.128]  Of course, as I say, the whole idea of the Royal International Affairs Council on Foreign Relations was to bring the world through a series of conflicts in order to take over all energy supplies, everything vital for a human.
[02:34:38.029 --> 02:34:59.284]  Sustainment basically, or containment, or even continuity as ability has to be taken over and owned by a conglomeration, a world conglomeration, and we're seeing that right now as they destabilize other countries and do the same with them one after another using the soft power.
[02:34:59.505 --> 02:35:02.567]  But you're quite right there with using organized crime
[02:35:02.947 --> 02:35:03.368]  We're good to go.
[02:35:19.585 --> 02:35:33.722]  And if the guys who said that the world to come for a while will be one of conflict everywhere, and basically these third world countries are brought under the control of the global governance system,
[02:35:34.788 --> 02:35:43.110]  And, uh, and the big corporations go in to seize, again, resources, all natural resources, uh, from those countries and take ownership of them.
[02:35:43.650 --> 02:35:44.170]  You understand?
[02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:54.312]  And I also said, too, uh, that the distinction, as you've mentioned there, but gangsters, et cetera, is that the distinction between organized crime and legitimate government would be very blurred.
[02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:56.813]  And it already has been for quite some time.
[02:35:57.473 --> 02:36:10.847]  For instance, the United States has been training, for the last few years, mercenaries from all over Latin America and elsewhere, training them in the United States, like the Old School of America's idea, and sending them in as assassins into Mexico.
[02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:24.217]  And so you have these organized, militarized assassination squads in Mexico right now, and you don't know if it's the drug gangs who are assassinating people and putting the bodies out in the streets as a warning, or if it's actually these mercenaries the U.S.
[02:36:24.657 --> 02:36:25.537]  is using.
[02:36:25.998 --> 02:36:33.401]  And because if they don't use the mercenaries right now to take out all the gangs in Mexico, they're going to have to send in the military.
[02:36:33.702 --> 02:36:35.362]  And people within Mexico know that.
[02:36:35.703 --> 02:36:37.203]  It will never be resolved from within.
[02:36:37.223 --> 02:36:39.985]  It will have to be an invasion from without.
[02:36:40.646 --> 02:36:43.070]  Uh, as these particular mercenary gangs don't work.
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:37:11.822]  So it's quite an interesting time to be watching all of this happening as they really move forward because the agenda has a timetable and these guys are obsessed with timetables and even in strategic trends, again the report they put out recently, they talk about their timetables stretching up now to the year 2050 and it's got everything in it, world depopulation, how much it will plummet in China, elsewhere, etc.
[02:37:13.044 --> 02:37:22.912]  And how they must fulfill the Millennium Goals, the Agenda 21 goals, and really ram them through with the animal corridors, human corridors, etc.
[02:37:23.193 --> 02:37:25.355]  We already have that happening back home.
[02:37:25.935 --> 02:37:30.039]  We have, again, even here we have communitarianism in Canada and America.
[02:37:30.719 --> 02:37:36.381]  You have these self-appointed panels, green panels, right down to your town councils.
[02:37:36.421 --> 02:37:37.941]  They have them appointed to them as well.
[02:37:38.202 --> 02:37:44.544]  You can't do anything at all on property without getting advice or paying a fee for an eco-impact, etc.
[02:37:45.104 --> 02:37:51.506]  So, we're already seeing the emergence of this whole new change society, time for change.
[02:37:52.086 --> 02:38:06.958]  Getting back to academia, when you brought academia on board, that was a buzzword used in academia for the last 50 years, that the 21st century would be the century of change, and that's why they gave that mantra to Obama to give out change.
[02:38:07.038 --> 02:38:07.819]  Change is good.
[02:38:08.079 --> 02:38:11.942]  They simply never told those in the dark what it actually meant.
[02:38:12.622 --> 02:38:13.883]  Well, we're seeing what it really means.
[02:38:14.504 --> 02:38:18.227]  It's the emergence of a world order, the planned society,
[02:38:18.807 --> 02:38:22.428]  In any planned society, they're never going to let the workers run it.
[02:38:22.768 --> 02:38:23.788]  Never let that happen.
[02:38:24.068 --> 02:38:32.230]  Like, if the appearance of a more orderly worker society, and it will be ordered, you'll be weighed from birth right through your whole life to see how much you're eating, for instance.
[02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:33.250]  That kind of stuff.
[02:38:33.690 --> 02:38:35.290]  But the problem's got to have a leisure class.
[02:38:35.850 --> 02:38:38.931]  For what they call progress, your problem's got to have a leisure class.
[02:38:39.251 --> 02:38:46.733]  Therefore, you'll have a very high elite paid class of professional people working in their think tanks.
[02:38:47.213 --> 02:38:48.173]  You'll be funding them all.
[02:38:49.145 --> 02:38:52.327]  And they will be basically planning the future for the world.
[02:38:52.747 --> 02:38:55.168]  That's their lovely utopia that they hope to bring in.
[02:38:55.188 --> 02:38:59.090]  And I don't see why they can't, because they've achieved so many objectives right now.
[02:39:00.351 --> 02:39:14.779]  And we forget all the time how many changes they've brought in, as I say, right down to your local council, by appointing themselves as an over-bureau, basically, to every little town council, particularly the federal level and provincial in Canada.
[02:39:15.299 --> 02:39:19.221]  It's up to the federal government so it's all there.
[02:39:19.861 --> 02:39:22.622]  The basic blueprint is all in position.
[02:39:23.043 --> 02:39:28.505]  All the players are there and all they have to get now is more and more power over the general population.
[02:39:29.106 --> 02:39:40.451]  If Britain is a flagship, a trial balloon for the whole world to follow, it's so far ahead now where everyone is policed from a thousand different sources on a daily basis.
[02:39:41.491 --> 02:39:48.094]  From your garbage pickup to how you take your children to school, how do you interact with your children?
[02:39:48.594 --> 02:39:53.375]  It is a complete socialist, planned, scientific society they're bringing in.
[02:39:53.395 --> 02:40:00.178]  And America, after it's finished off the unification of the Americas, and finished off its job in the Middle East,
[02:40:00.618 --> 02:40:16.905]  Has to emulate that exact same society for the whole world has to do it in fact and then we'll be taxed on energy units consumption etc austerity for those at the bottom a very high living for those at the top who are the world managers and that that's the whole game plan.
[02:40:17.847 --> 02:40:39.464]  Yeah, just to go back to what you said about the Mexican drug gangs and the CIA-trained assassination squads, there's really no doubt that those people are being used for the purpose you describe, but also, they're using the drug gang thing to advance the perimeter, the North American security perimeter, even as they have this kind of Iran-Contra-style Fast and Furious scandal unfolding.
[02:40:40.171 --> 02:40:56.389]  Yes, as you know too, the Department of Homeland Security took over basically the perimeter of the United States and it started with 50 miles, now they're into 100 miles around the coastline, inland, etc.
[02:40:56.489 --> 02:40:58.051]  and from the Canadian border southwards.
[02:40:59.105 --> 02:41:00.826]  And they want to do the same thing.
[02:41:00.846 --> 02:41:05.870]  A few years ago in the paper, they wanted the whole of the Americas to have this organization.
[02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:07.552]  They called it Fortress America.
[02:41:07.572 --> 02:41:22.783]  And that's when the Prime Minister of Canada and the US President of Mexico met together in a few Latin American countries and they drew up a map and they wanted to actually bring in Fortress America with a homeland security all along the Canadian border.
[02:41:22.903 --> 02:41:26.906]  That's a coastline, a whole lot, right down through Latin America and back up again.
[02:41:29.151 --> 02:41:32.034]  They're using every crisis for complete amalgamation.
[02:41:32.174 --> 02:41:39.060]  And, by the way, the Council on Foreign Relations has said in Canada, we are using this financial crisis for deeper integration.
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:42.403]  That means merging with the United States of America.
[02:41:42.743 --> 02:41:43.784]  That's been in the open here.
[02:41:45.305 --> 02:41:45.765]  I'm sure.
[02:41:45.965 --> 02:41:53.407]  And getting back into the Occupy Wall Street formation of that global revolution, what do you see happening?
[02:41:53.447 --> 02:42:00.608]  Because obviously there's a lot of grassroots energy, people upset about general economic conditions, but not a lot of specifics.
[02:42:01.008 --> 02:42:08.190]  And it's really pretty textbook that if you don't have an energy that's inside of what's already been established inside the left-right paradigm,
[02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:18.517]  You can either, A, disrupt it, or more easily you can vent that anger, give them a certain pleasure that they're being spoken to and heard while co-opting it, Alan.
[02:42:19.237 --> 02:42:20.638]  So what direction do you see this going?
[02:42:21.199 --> 02:42:27.363]  Well, the Burleigh told me they're going because in one of the first World Trade Organization meetings they hadn't publicized
[02:42:28.318 --> 02:42:32.501]  They showed you a little interview inside the meeting.
[02:42:32.881 --> 02:42:43.827]  They were looking down at the protest, as they always do from the ivory towers, and they said we'll have to eventually, over the years, bring the leaders in on board with our panel discussions and become part of it.
[02:42:44.427 --> 02:42:56.434]  Well, they've been doing that for years now, since then, and we've, you know, for instance, we've watched appointees of Obama's specialists on his panels, unelected people who are now experts, these science stars, etc.
[02:42:57.589 --> 02:42:57.989]  I don't
[02:43:17.483 --> 02:43:18.103]  We're good to go.
[02:43:37.635 --> 02:43:38.275]  We're good to go.
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:04.341]  leading the thing against Wall Street, the charge against Wall Street.
[02:44:04.701 --> 02:44:16.005]  So they already have these guys on board with government and all these organizations and they're also part of these supposedly left-wing socialist organizations for world governments, or governments they call it.
[02:44:17.305 --> 02:44:24.888]  Lawrence Mitchell as well, he was the Economic Policy Institute's president, a longtime member of Democratic Socialists of America.
[02:44:25.723 --> 02:44:27.564]  And he's also in it too.
[02:44:27.584 --> 02:44:35.988]  So all these big boys are in on the Wall Street thing while they also work with these big foundations that work with Obama and government as well.
[02:44:36.228 --> 02:44:40.551]  So it's government leading what appears to be a revolt of the people.
[02:44:43.471 --> 02:44:53.617]  We've seen a big hype for war with Iran with this phony assassination plot taking place last week really paper-thin despite what the headlines would lead you to believe.
[02:44:54.037 --> 02:44:55.357]  Now there's other incidents.
[02:44:55.397 --> 02:45:01.881]  There was a guy on a plane that landed in Texas who was screaming in Arabic and then how everyone was gonna die.
[02:45:02.301 --> 02:45:10.105]  Now you've got these Muslims busted at a Texas courthouse who I believe they had blueprints and there was a bomb scare or something.
[02:45:10.605 --> 02:45:12.086]  Are they preparing for something Alan?
[02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:32.124]  Oh yeah, I mean from the 90s they've been preparing for it in fact because we know that the New American Century group published a list of countries they had to take out and they wanted to start with Afghanistan, Iraq and then it would be a toss-up between Syria or Iran to follow.
[02:45:32.704 --> 02:45:35.226]  They mentioned Egypt as well and eventually North Korea.
[02:45:35.806 --> 02:45:37.487]  That said, the main ones were in the Middle East.
[02:45:38.247 --> 02:45:46.252]  And we see that Rumsfeld and Cheney both congratulated Obama for continuing their policy of taking over those countries.
[02:45:46.572 --> 02:45:50.234]  Now, the New American Century group under Bush called it revolutionary democracy.
[02:45:50.254 --> 02:45:53.576]  In other words, you invade and force democracy upon them.
[02:45:54.296 --> 02:46:03.221]  And now we're seeing this group here using the color revolutions, followed by hard power military power, which is exactly, again, what the think tank for the military said to do.
[02:46:03.261 --> 02:46:04.382]  And they published their findings.
[02:46:05.137 --> 02:46:09.219]  I've got more of them on my website, so all their different think tank reports.
[02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:14.522]  So they're following the agenda, they said that they'd follow back in the 90s.
[02:46:15.303 --> 02:46:25.028]  Jefferson said it, when you say the same policies, the same policies follow from changes in house, between one to the next house, then you know you're under tyranny.
[02:46:25.228 --> 02:46:30.491]  You're not under a different government, a different party, it's the same organization running the same policies.
[02:46:30.511 --> 02:46:32.152]  And that's what you're seeing.
[02:46:33.146 --> 02:46:33.747]  Yes, certainly.
[02:46:33.787 --> 02:46:36.469]  If you want to call it a Black Ops Network or whatever.
[02:46:36.889 --> 02:46:46.036]  And now you even have reports like Paul Watson's from today on the State Department agitator, who was part of the Egypt Arab Spring, backed by the State Department.
[02:46:46.076 --> 02:46:49.699]  Now he's advising the Occupy Wall Street movement, Alan.
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:52.181]  Yes, like the ones that are straight off, too.
[02:46:52.201 --> 02:46:56.445]  These guys are all members and working with the government.
[02:46:56.925 --> 02:47:01.569]  And they also run some of the largest socialist organizations of America.
[02:47:03.556 --> 02:47:19.579]  I don't realise, I don't know if Americans realise, that the Socialist International, how big and powerful they are, and that the British Labour government kicks off its annual meeting, and they finish their annual meeting, and they sing the red flag.
[02:47:20.059 --> 02:47:20.679]  Did they know that?
[02:47:20.699 --> 02:47:29.601]  Tony Blair, I've got videos about Tony Blair and all the big boys who are in charge of Britain, and they were singing, we'll keep the red flag flying high.
[02:47:30.297 --> 02:47:37.565]  They don't understand that Sarkozy, all the people across the world, right through into the United Nations, are members of this organization.
[02:47:39.026 --> 02:47:40.468]  Including the ones in America.
[02:47:41.489 --> 02:47:43.852]  Yeah, not to mention all the... They sing at their annual meetings.
[02:47:44.612 --> 02:47:49.117]  And the press generally doesn't bother reporting that part, but in Britain, some people have.
[02:47:50.038 --> 02:47:51.660]  And they've filmed it and documented it.
[02:47:53.197 --> 02:48:00.903]  As a side note, I've seen a lot of these trendy bars popping up here in town in Austin with the communist hammer and sickle on the logo.
[02:48:03.124 --> 02:48:03.905]  Just goes to show.
[02:48:03.925 --> 02:48:12.431]  So, dialectics, remember, Hegel pointed out the dialectic and how he always used opposing sides to bring out the new.
[02:48:13.172 --> 02:48:17.715]  And what you also do under the Marxist program, basically,
[02:48:18.502 --> 02:48:41.128]  is that each generation of Marxists must be more radical than the previous one and that they've got the right to eliminate physically if need be the older ones who are still contaminated with the old ideas and today we're seeing that they are ones who have the fresh group, the fresh crop, they're freshly trained in university because that's where all the leaders come from
[02:48:41.668 --> 02:48:51.134]  They're all trained by professional professors to agitate for the new system, a better, a more fairer world of justice, etc.
[02:48:51.394 --> 02:49:01.081]  But, of course, with world managers like themselves living high on the hog, because, as I said, you have to have an intelligentsia class and a leisure class to help plan the future.
[02:49:01.561 --> 02:49:10.647]  So, yeah, this is really the Marxist agenda, and that's why Marxism was founded, basically, in London.
[02:49:11.888 --> 02:49:16.451]  Marx was funded by one of the biggest factory owners in the whole of Europe.
[02:49:16.851 --> 02:49:18.012]  He wasn't a poor little guy.
[02:49:18.032 --> 02:49:19.834]  He had his own personal servant and all the rest of it.
[02:49:20.494 --> 02:49:33.924]  And they've used this dialectic since then because the bankers prefer socialist governments because, as I say, there's a layer of government for every facet of humanity.
[02:49:33.944 --> 02:49:36.646]  It's total control over humanity is what it is.
[02:49:38.015 --> 02:49:50.946]  Yeah, and maybe on the other side of the break here in the last segment we could talk about how Al Gore, who is part of the Arm and Hammer empire, who backed the Soviet Union, called for this American version of the Arab Spring about three weeks before it popped up, Alan.
[02:49:52.067 --> 02:49:52.287]  Okay.
[02:49:53.168 --> 02:49:54.169]  Yeah.
[02:49:54.249 --> 02:49:56.211]  Or your comments now as we go out to break here.
[02:49:56.846 --> 02:50:26.373]  Oh yeah, I mean Arm and Hammer, again, his father changed his name to be the Arm and Hammer that you see on the British Communist site and the British Freemason site, by the way, they use the Arm and Hammer instead of the Cumberland Square, and that's where he changed his name to actually be a Soviet, the epitome of the Sovietism basically, a multi-millionaire, and he had an apartment next to Lenin and then Stalin, and he'd come back in force during the Cold War, Arm and Hammer,
[02:50:27.365 --> 02:50:34.330]  No one stopped him, bothered him, or asked him what he was up to, and helped organize the far left in America.
[02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:36.191]  The big boys all knew what they were doing.
[02:50:36.692 --> 02:50:40.014]  The big bankers all knew what he was up about because it's part of the agenda.
[02:50:40.434 --> 02:50:46.558]  They must merge the two systems together to bring out the synthesis, the next part, the next part.
[02:50:46.598 --> 02:50:50.081]  Final segment with Alan Watt coming up on the other side of this break.
[02:50:50.421 --> 02:50:52.062]  Then tonight, the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:50:52.382 --> 02:50:53.984]  Stay tuned, InfoWars.com.

[02:52:00.424 --> 02:52:01.585]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:01.845 --> 02:52:12.292]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:12.512 --> 02:52:16.655]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:52:16.975 --> 02:52:19.397]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:52:19.717 --> 02:52:30.364]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:52:30.984 --> 02:52:34.287]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:52:34.467 --> 02:52:40.151]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:52:40.632 --> 02:52:50.099]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:52:50.519 --> 02:52:51.700]  The war is here.
[02:52:52.020 --> 02:52:53.441]  It's an info war.
[02:52:53.921 --> 02:52:55.843]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:53:01.343 --> 02:53:06.807]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[02:53:07.047 --> 02:53:10.870]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:16.514]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[02:53:16.954 --> 02:53:22.598]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[02:53:22.938 --> 02:53:29.199]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[02:53:29.499 --> 02:53:36.841]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[02:53:37.201 --> 02:53:46.003]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[02:53:46.443 --> 02:53:52.426]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method, which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[02:53:52.786 --> 02:53:55.688]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[02:53:55.988 --> 02:53:58.069]  That's survivalrx.com.
[02:54:00.731 --> 02:54:01.291]  We've got it.
[02:54:01.331 --> 02:54:07.914]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:54:08.235 --> 02:54:11.836]  Alright, here I go.
[02:54:16.317 --> 02:54:19.458]  We are in the final segment with our guest, Alan Watt.
[02:54:19.578 --> 02:54:23.379]  He's covered really the spectrum here of the long-term strategy.
[02:54:23.719 --> 02:54:30.020]  The rebroadcast is coming up with Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Webster Tarpley, and Alan Watt, of course.
[02:54:30.761 --> 02:54:40.023]  But Alan, in these final few minutes, in addition to anything you want to bring up, I would just like to point out that obviously the elections are totally controlled, really have always been a farce.
[02:54:40.683 --> 02:54:46.590]  But at the same time, the Democratic Party is looking to co-opt the energy of Occupy movements everywhere.
[02:54:47.011 --> 02:54:48.632]  They have plans for new taxes.
[02:54:49.213 --> 02:54:52.357]  The puppets on the right also have their plans for fresh taxes.
[02:54:52.857 --> 02:54:58.224]  How will this energy be used and what do we make of people like Al Gore calling for an American Arab Spring, Alan?
[02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:19.760]  Well, you're going to see more and more private people, really from these labor organizations, the ones who run them, or control them, or agitate them, more and more of those guys brought on board for government policy, as appointees, again, on behalf of the workers, as I'll tell you.
[02:55:20.465 --> 02:55:27.747]  And in reality, they're professionally trained and run by the big boys who run the policy institutes, etc.
[02:55:28.227 --> 02:55:31.928]  So it's time for a change, they say.
[02:55:31.948 --> 02:55:35.529]  Make the people think they have more representation, etc.
[02:55:35.909 --> 02:55:40.430]  And there'll be a lot of show in government as they yell at each other once in a while, but there'll be nothing but a show.
[02:55:40.711 --> 02:55:42.271]  You need to plan society
[02:55:42.711 --> 02:55:53.114]  You're already into a global society and so many treaties have been signed over the last 50 years to bind it all together so that you can't just pull out and continue.
[02:55:53.515 --> 02:56:03.558]  We are now dependent on outside sources to even eat nowadays and most of the food's being imported from elsewhere to make sure that all the farms were destroyed.
[02:56:03.578 --> 02:56:09.640]  That was part of the destruction of the farms by government policies and interference with the EPA and
[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:11.080]  We're good to go.
[02:56:35.186 --> 02:56:39.611]  And be completely ignorant of the big agenda, the big goal at the end of it all.
[02:56:39.732 --> 02:56:41.093]  It cannot happen.
[02:56:42.355 --> 02:56:46.160]  I gave up on his left wing, right wing strategy a long time ago.
[02:56:46.180 --> 02:56:47.081]  I knew it was a con.
[02:56:48.125 --> 02:56:49.667]  I've seen it happen in other countries, too.
[02:56:49.727 --> 02:56:51.468]  Various countries across Europe have seen us all.
[02:56:51.508 --> 02:56:52.429]  The con's been played.
[02:56:52.449 --> 02:57:03.898]  It's been played in America to the very, very end, of course, because most Americans know darn well that they've just signed another free trade deal, one of the biggest ones, with various Latin American countries.
[02:57:03.918 --> 02:57:05.379]  That's a one-way street for trade.
[02:57:05.439 --> 02:57:10.263]  It's all imports into America and subsidizing those countries to come up to first world status.
[02:57:10.283 --> 02:57:11.844]  We're going to pay out, pay out, pay out.
[02:57:12.124 --> 02:57:14.026]  That's part of the redistribution of wealth.
[02:57:14.486 --> 02:57:14.907]  We're good to go.
[02:57:30.267 --> 02:57:30.988]  You're in trouble.
[02:57:31.188 --> 02:57:32.690]  That's a very basic thing.
[02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:34.412]  Very basic thing.
[02:57:34.452 --> 02:57:42.360]  We're totally dependent now on electricity, power, energy of all kinds, and they want to have a world grid system.
[02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:43.220]  They're building it now.
[02:57:43.881 --> 02:57:52.470]  Literally, you'll have a world power supply company that will feed it to each region, and they'll decide on how much you'll get that day or that week.
[02:57:52.970 --> 02:57:55.252]  And that's the planned system of the future.
[02:57:55.272 --> 02:58:00.917]  It'll be very expensive, even for a day's worth of it, in fact, so the companies aren't losing money by giving you less.
[02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:05.360]  And we're being set up with smart meters, smart grids, all for that system.
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:10.304]  But they actually have maps up of the world grid system at the United Nations and elsewhere.
[02:58:10.985 --> 02:58:19.332]  So we're well along the road to it, and we're still talking in almost a 19th century paradigm about politics and left and right.
[02:58:19.652 --> 02:58:20.733]  We're way past that point.
[02:58:21.252 --> 02:58:22.413]  Okay, Alan, we'll leave it there.
[02:58:22.493 --> 02:58:26.656]  We really appreciate you joining us once again and always appreciate your insights.
[02:58:27.057 --> 02:58:30.860]  Again, tune in to the rebroadcast and tonight, the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:32.461]  Alex Jones back tomorrow.
