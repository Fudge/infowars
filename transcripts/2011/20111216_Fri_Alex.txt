[00:00:06.311 --> 00:00:10.514]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:11.975]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:13.696]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:17.898]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:22.602]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:33.589]  We are launching another live global transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.154]  Thank you for riding shotgun with us today.
[00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:40.617]  It is Friday, the 16th of December, 2011.
[00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:59.330]  And we have the director and producer of the new film proving that Oklahoma City bombing in 95 was a government inside job false flag terror attack used as a pretext
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:11.271]  To take liberties in this nation and demonize the proto Tea Party constitutional movement that was gaining steam, the state's rights movement, in 1995.
[00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:22.484]  Bill Clinton, of course, told reporters on Air Force One right after being re-elected in 96 that he owed his re-election
[00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:27.276]  Entirely.
[00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:33.378]  You can pull the quotes up in USA Today to that bombing and how it brought the country together.
[00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:50.804]  He means let him play the part of a victim and take on the images of the dead children and to basically say if you don't support me and all of my gun grabbing policies and the UN and the rest of it, you support domestic terrorism.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.431]  And these gentlemen have gone out and gotten interviews with survivors of the attack, like Jane Graham, who saw McVeigh and other government people planting bombs in the building.
[00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:02.816]  Terence Yakey, cop of the year, who knew it was a government job.
[00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:05.019]  They've talked to his mother.
[00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.287]  This is an amazing film.
[00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.510]  It's available, by the way, at Infowars.com.
[00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:12.734]  They kind of snuck up on me that they're on today.
[00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:15.017]  I wanted to play some clips.
[00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:18.223]  We'll probably play the trailer, at least, when they join us here.
[00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:21.107]  But they've spent years making this.
[00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:23.130]  I hope you get it.
[00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.391]  Again, it's available at Infowars.com.
[00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:50.349]  Your purchase supports my operation, their filmmaking operation, but more importantly, you get a film that is a testament to history to understand why this Attorney General and this Democratic Party carried out Operation Fast and Furious, shipping guns into Mexico, narcotics back into the United States, and laundering money, which has come out in the Chicago Tribune, El Paso Times, and now the New York Times.
[00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.390]  But they have these whitewashes.
[00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:55.092]  In fact, I saw a New York Times article.
[00:02:55.172 --> 00:03:00.116]  I embedded it to you guys, but I haven't seen it in the stack yet, but I haven't gone through all of it.
[00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:01.518]  Got here a bit late today.
[00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.342]  But there was a New York Times article about watching a president cave in.
[00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:17.911]  And it said, oh, the president got pressured into now saying he'll sign the National Defense Authorization Act to put troops on the streets of America.
[00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:30.932]  How wonderful the news that he was going to oppose it but then they put pressure on him and it's just too bad he caved.
[00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:33.113]  That was the cover story.
[00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:42.996]  It's on record and the letters from the White House have been made public to the Senators asking them from the beginning
[00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:47.195]  To add the provision in there that U.S.
[00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:56.962]  citizens can be arrested by the military, detained indefinitely, disappear into a black hole, be transported to a foreign country, and disappear.
[00:03:56.982 --> 00:04:05.068]  I mean, the British did far less, and they were revolted against by our forefathers.
[00:04:05.108 --> 00:04:07.469]  By the way, yesterday was Bill of Rights Day.
[00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.491]  It's ratification day.
[00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:12.126]  Obama hasn't signed it yet.
[00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:15.047]  He said he was going to sign it, or was looking to sign it yesterday, but they didn't.
[00:04:16.127 --> 00:04:21.110]  Today is the Boston Tea Party anniversary, December 16th, 1773.
[00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.693]  And who knows, he may robo-sign it with a robot, which is unconstitutional, and that's why he does it.
[00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.712]  I mean, they launch wars now without even a rubber stamp from Congress.
[00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:38.452]  So, it's all coming up today.
[00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:43.113]  Chris Emory, James Lane will be joining us from Oklahoma via Skype.
[00:04:43.573 --> 00:04:46.694]  Bob Chapman, always, will be with us in the last 40 minutes of the show.
[00:04:46.714 --> 00:04:49.434]  I wanted to have at least an hour and 20 minutes with those guests.
[00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:53.095]  Bob will give us the last 40 on the economy, give us his weekly breakdown on that.
[00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:58.116]  I haven't even gotten into all the news, dealing with another strike against free speech.
[00:04:59.216 --> 00:04:59.636]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:02.823]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:09.010]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.

[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.541]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:10.383]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:13.025]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:18.508]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:25.172]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:31.115]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:35.218]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:35.718 --> 00:06:39.700]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.944]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:48.905]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:50.886]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:51.487 --> 00:06:52.007]  It's here.

[00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:20.579]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.540]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.301]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:42.313]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:44.075]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:46.936]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:51.299]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:07:58.944 --> 00:07:59.805]  Others don't.
[00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:04.880]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:16.845]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:29.070]  Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us, for listening to the broadcast, and for supporting the broadcast and spreading the word about syndicated radio slash TV transmission.
[00:08:30.188 --> 00:08:32.529]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.150]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.653]  Central and then of course back Sundays and I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:40.394]  Central Time.
[00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:50.901]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv where we stream the video of the radio show as well and of course PrisonPlanet.com
[00:08:53.922 --> 00:08:57.005]  Twitter.com forward slash Real Alex Jones.
[00:08:57.786 --> 00:09:03.971]  You can find the Facebook and the rest of it as well linked at InfoWars.com at the top of every article page.
[00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:08.175]  We have little icons there that lead you to the different fronts that we're...
[00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:11.396]  Fighting the globalists on in cyberspace.
[00:09:12.297 --> 00:09:16.858]  And speaking of that, here is a AFP article.
[00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:21.739]  French news agency Internet Architects Oppose U.S.
[00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:23.759]  Online Piracy Bills.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:37.322]  And The Hill, The Washington Post, basically every publication out there, even establishment publications admit this is a war on free speech.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:46.031]  That was one headline, a quote, Chinese, Communist Chinese censorship model.
[00:09:46.793 --> 00:09:49.698]  This is exactly what we're dealing with here.
[00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:59.108]  A group of prominent architects of the internet added their voices Thursday to those opposing legislation in the U.S.
[00:09:59.168 --> 00:10:02.851]  Congress intended to crack down on online piracy.
[00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:14.080]  In an open letter to Congress, more than 80 engineers, inventors, and software developers expressed concerns about the bills introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives that they're trying to pass today.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.181]  Notice they're trying to get it all through right now.
[00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:20.505]  To use the military domestically, to arrest whoever they want, to kill whoever they want,
[00:10:23.868 --> 00:10:25.390]  The literal anti-Bill of Rights.
[00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:29.575]  A huge declaration of tyranny against everyone.
[00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.139]  In an open letter to Congress, more than 80 engineers
[00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:47.078]  Inventors and software developers, including people, you know, the real inventors of the Internet, not Al Gore, who asinine, you know, lied, had no connection to it, expressed concerns about the bills introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives.
[00:10:47.578 --> 00:11:02.410]  Their letter came a day after the founders of Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and other Internet giants voiced opposition to stop online piracy act being considered in the House and Senate version known as the Protect IP Act, Intellectual Property Act.
[00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:10.116]  Which is really just the secret international copyright treaty that Obama's tried to keep secret for two years.
[00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:15.781]  That China and Russia, by the way, support and are already using to censor their political enemies.
[00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:18.764]  The legislation...
[00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:33.795]  The legislation has received the backing of Hollywood, the music industry, the Business Software Alliance, and the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S.
[00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:35.355]  Chamber of Commerce, and other groups.
[00:11:35.935 --> 00:11:41.497]  Well, yeah, it allows them to just shut down anybody.
[00:11:41.957 --> 00:11:44.497]  I mean, you've heard how they've... What was it?
[00:11:44.858 --> 00:11:49.959]  Rupert Murdoch was suing Skype because it has SKY in the beginning of it?
[00:11:51.713 --> 00:11:54.556]  It's not even called Sky, it's called Skype!
[00:11:56.377 --> 00:12:03.404]  I mean, can I call something SKY and then add something on to the end of it?
[00:12:03.444 --> 00:12:04.485]  I mean, there's hundreds of words.
[00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:13.733]  So it's getting down to the very words to where we can't communicate and in this new digital system where everything's connected, you won't even be able to talk.
[00:12:14.113 --> 00:12:15.434]  In fact, they're discussing making
[00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:23.258]  Digital words that you speak online over Skype or over other systems that that will be censored now.
[00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:36.766]  You're hearing that they're coming out with Embedded Trojan Tech inside the smartphones where government just hits a button and citywide they all turn off or their cameras turn off and
[00:12:38.168 --> 00:12:46.614]  You're seeing what Toyota and others are announcing that soon the car will have a little scrambler system that turns your cell phone off when the car is on.
[00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:50.697]  See, you are guilty until proven slave.
[00:12:51.597 --> 00:12:53.018]  It's not guilty until proven innocent.
[00:12:53.178 --> 00:13:01.544]  You are guilty, period, and everything you do is going to be tracked, and you're going to pay for it all with the not even Trojan horse stuff that's built into it.
[00:13:01.604 --> 00:13:03.926]  Now, it was Trojan horse the last 20 years.
[00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:05.127]  Now it's just in your face.
[00:13:09.448 --> 00:13:20.711]  I mean, I tell people 15 years ago that cell phones by law had to have a switch where the government can dial in and turn them on even when they look like they're off and listen to you.
[00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:23.332]  And now in the last five, six years, they've admitted it.
[00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:30.634]  Again, until they get something through, they never want to have a discussion about it.
[00:13:34.352 --> 00:13:40.173]  It goes on to say, but it's come under fire from digital rights and free speech organizations for allegedly paving the way for U.S.
[00:13:40.213 --> 00:13:48.135]  authorities to shut down websites accused of online piracy, including foreign sites, without due process.
[00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:49.976]  That's an international agreement.
[00:13:50.696 --> 00:14:02.079]  If enacted, either of these bills will create an environment of tremendous fear and uncertainty for technology innovation and seriously harm the credibility of the United States and its role as a steward of key internet infrastructure.
[00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:05.080]  The Internet Architects said in their letter.
[00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:15.685]  Both bills risk fragmenting the Internet's global domain name system and have other capricious technical consequences, they said, such as promoting censorship.
[00:14:16.686 --> 00:14:30.293]  All censorship schemes impact speech beyond the category they're intended to restrict, but these bills are particularly egregious in that regard because they cause entire domains to vanish from the web, not just infringing pages or files, they said.
[00:14:31.144 --> 00:14:35.745]  An incredible range of useful law-abiding sites can be blacklisted under these proposals.
[00:14:35.805 --> 00:14:46.107]  Yes, it is a, and this is the main architects of the internet, most of them former NSA engineers, you can go read their names, I bet we should probably get some of them on, saying what I've told you.
[00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:57.428]  I told you years ago how they would do it, how they would roll it out through copyright, and already the Justice Department in the last two years, every day I hear about them seizing hundreds of sites, sometimes thousands.
[00:14:58.089 --> 00:15:00.089]  They'll go into a giant server farm
[00:15:01.377 --> 00:15:02.638]  Division of an IT company.
[00:15:02.658 --> 00:15:03.880]  You see it in the news constantly.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:21.799]  And we'll grab 50,000, 100,000 sites at a pop, entire buildings, and pull the computers out of the walls, the servers, and drag them off for one link on a message board to a song that you can download.
[00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:35.433]  In fact, just last week there was a headline where the Justice Department, a year after it admitted it, shut down a big music site where people were putting alternative music in kind of a commons because they wanted to be heard posting it.
[00:15:35.473 --> 00:15:37.334]  It was alternative music.
[00:15:37.514 --> 00:15:40.516]  And the record industry got mad because they couldn't control it.
[00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:46.339]  They want to decide what becomes popular and so they just basically paid the government to go in and shut it down.
[00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.121]  It was a site making millions of dollars a month.
[00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.722]  And because they claimed four songs out of hundreds of thousands.
[00:15:54.022 --> 00:15:55.863]  That's a site where you post your music.
[00:15:56.523 --> 00:15:59.564]  And then it turned out those four songs had the authorization.
[00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:05.146]  That's kind of like Shooter Jennings gave me the contract.
[00:16:05.286 --> 00:16:06.446]  He holds the copyright.
[00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.647]  He approached us as a listener of the show.
[00:16:09.707 --> 00:16:15.629]  I said, hey, we ought to put this in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, your Summer of Rage song about martial law coming to America.
[00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:34.389]  And I got a contract saying I have full right to do it, boom, got hit with a copyright deal by the record company, even though they don't hold the copyright, even though he authorized me to, and I had to literally send them letters and say, okay, if you want to go to the route of other, they were trying to shut my videos down online.
[00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:42.274]  I make the film, I give it away for free, get millions of views online, trying to warn people, and I've got an automatic computer system.
[00:16:45.407 --> 00:16:46.668]  Now they do it for audio.
[00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:47.808]  Now, here's an example.
[00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:48.349]  Endgame.
[00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:50.730]  I decided to distribute into stores.
[00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.691]  I hold the copyright.
[00:16:52.571 --> 00:17:08.641]  And then a sub-distributor out of Canada, um, fed all the films that they have the distribution rights to, the audio from them, not just the music, but the voices, into a database, and now when anybody tries to upload Endgame,
[00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:13.232]  Even 30 seconds of it, my voice is blocked off the internet.
[00:17:13.712 --> 00:17:24.797]  That's what this does, and the NSA runs it, the Department of Defense is in control of it, the four branches of the military, and that's why they talk about domestically operating inside the United States.
[00:17:25.237 --> 00:17:28.618]  This is the military now, able to go in and just shut your website down.
[00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:32.580]  Shut the servers down, shut the domain name down, for nothing!
[00:17:34.001 --> 00:17:34.621]  For nothing!
[00:17:37.245 --> 00:17:41.327]  And the government, Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are, says they want to do this.
[00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:45.190]  In fact, he says he wants people like myself arrested.
[00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.892]  And he said, what's the benchmark of arresting someone?
[00:17:48.912 --> 00:17:51.253]  Well, they say 9-11 might be an inside job.
[00:17:51.313 --> 00:17:51.813]  Arrest them.
[00:17:53.634 --> 00:18:03.220]  He said, if you say that a little bit of sunlight's needed, which most doctors say, it's on record, it decreases cancer, internal cancer.
[00:18:04.192 --> 00:18:05.433]  That you need some moderate son.
[00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:07.734]  He said, I believe that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:08.235]  Arrested.
[00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.136]  I mean, there's been mainstream articles about this.
[00:18:10.536 --> 00:18:12.478]  People say, well, that sounds crazy and over the top.
[00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:15.440]  Tyrants are about being over the top.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.384]  They're about setting the precedent that when they say jump, you say how high.
[00:18:23.785 --> 00:18:25.126]  And then you jump how high they say.
[00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:26.707]  They say, jump one foot, you jump one foot.
[00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:28.168]  They still beat you over the head.
[00:18:28.188 --> 00:18:29.229]  You say, why'd you do that?
[00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:32.171]  And they said, because I didn't like the look on your face.
[00:18:33.618 --> 00:18:38.362]  It's all about we do what we want because we're getting ready to take all your pension funds.
[00:18:39.082 --> 00:18:40.764]  And we're getting ready to fully bankrupt you.
[00:18:41.304 --> 00:18:48.270]  And the only people that are going to be on the payroll is paramilitary people with drones and goons absolutely breaking you.
[00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:50.892]  And these globalists think they can get away with it.
[00:18:51.332 --> 00:18:53.974]  It's like Corzine gets up on TV and says, I don't know where the billions went.
[00:18:53.994 --> 00:18:57.537]  And the head of the CMT group goes, he took the money.
[00:18:58.678 --> 00:19:01.200]  And the media and the government and the Justice Department says, well, he can keep it.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.640]  That's fine.
[00:19:03.171 --> 00:19:05.133]  And by the way, we're going to ship drugs in for your children to use.
[00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:10.137]  They're going to show you Marines growing opium on Fox News and say it's patriotic.
[00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:16.963]  And the government admits, okay, we got the underwear bomber on the plane on Christmas Day two years ago, but still it's okay.
[00:19:19.546 --> 00:19:25.271]  I mean, now they don't even, I don't even know why they think they need to start shutting down the internet and censoring talk radio and the people.
[00:19:25.571 --> 00:19:28.494]  Now it's all out there and they just flounce around doing it.
[00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:48.783]  And everybody else is too busy talking about, you know, the NFL, and how important that is, so... But there is a lot of people waking up, and so, the globalists know they're going into this final phase of takeover, and that's why they're saying they're gonna use the military against us, they're gonna secretly arrest here where they want, and they're gonna start shutting the internet down.
[00:19:50.643 --> 00:19:51.744]  No judge, no jury.
[00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.525]  Corporations say shut a site down, no judge, no jury.
[00:19:55.845 --> 00:19:56.925]  Your site's gone.
[00:19:57.926 --> 00:19:59.006]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:20:03.594 --> 00:20:08.638]  From the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas.

[00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:31.714]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:36.256]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.436 --> 00:21:42.158]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:42.238 --> 00:21:45.599]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.879 --> 00:21:48.483]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.603 --> 00:21:53.510]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:21:55.292 --> 00:21:55.953]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:02.162 --> 00:22:12.591]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:19.737]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:20.037 --> 00:22:30.806]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:22:31.286 --> 00:22:34.627]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:40.449]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:50.413]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:50.813 --> 00:22:51.973]  The war is here.
[00:22:52.313 --> 00:22:53.754]  It's an info war.
[00:22:54.214 --> 00:22:56.895]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:23:01.792 --> 00:23:05.375]  Has the United States been discovered in the Bible?
[00:23:05.475 --> 00:23:07.737]  Where does Islam fit in Bible prophecy?
[00:23:07.977 --> 00:23:10.459]  Is the New World Order world government?
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:18.766]  These and other crucial end time questions are answered in the new DVD package, Understanding the End Time, from End Time Ministries.
[00:23:19.226 --> 00:23:26.852]  Jesus Christ said, I tell you these things before they come to pass, so that when they do come to pass, you might believe.
[00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:31.316]  After you watch this 14 lesson DVD series, Understanding the End Time,
[00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:32.217]  We're good to go.
[00:24:09.744 --> 00:24:11.706]  Yeah, I'm just a castaway.
[00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:15.209]  Sending out an S.O.S.
[00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:29.962]  I've been warning people for a long time about the fact that historical trends prove that we were headed into tyranny.
[00:24:32.424 --> 00:24:35.487]  The globalists themselves, let's crank that back up.
[00:24:35.687 --> 00:24:36.728]  Sending out an S.O.S.
[00:24:40.704 --> 00:24:53.851]  Yeah, but this isn't a message in the bottle now.
[00:24:53.911 --> 00:25:06.978]  I mean, sure, 17 years ago when I first got on air, I could see some people who had no historical reference seeing what was happening in the country and... That's good, thanks.
[00:25:07.718 --> 00:25:08.599]  And getting upset.
[00:25:12.341 --> 00:25:20.008]  That somebody like myself was criticizing their precious government and their precious system because that's how childlike people think and operate.
[00:25:20.929 --> 00:25:30.617]  That they think the government is their government and when you're criticizing it that you're being unpatriotic when that's the opposite of patriotism to just do whatever the government says.
[00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:37.043]  That's how you get a North Korea or a Communist China or a Nazi Germany or a
[00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:39.845]  Soviet Russia.
[00:25:39.865 --> 00:25:55.993]  I mean, I go over this over and over again, and now we have bonafide, classical, in-your-face tyranny on every single front in this country.
[00:25:57.613 --> 00:25:58.294]  And worldwide.
[00:25:58.314 --> 00:26:03.576]  It's global, standardized, corporate takeover, the New World Order system.
[00:26:05.874 --> 00:26:13.620]  And it's anti-family, it's anti-individual private property right, it's pro-police state, total surveillance, secret arrest, mass murder.
[00:26:14.821 --> 00:26:25.329]  And it's sold as if it's security, when you can see that none of us are secure, and that as this system is brought into place, the economy is dying, the society is imploding.
[00:26:25.369 --> 00:26:29.793]  I saw an AP article today that, you know, mayors and state officials
[00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:38.597]  Complained to the federal government that homelessness is up and joblessness and crime and things are falling apart and that this isn't a recovery.
[00:26:38.857 --> 00:26:40.658]  It was never meant to be a recovery.
[00:26:40.898 --> 00:26:47.922]  Just because they keep saying for three years, oh we might go back into recession, we never left the recession four years ago.
[00:26:48.562 --> 00:26:54.405]  We're in a depression according to every classical economic metric, measurement.
[00:26:56.346 --> 00:26:59.328]  But there's a new level of lying by government.
[00:27:01.448 --> 00:27:13.833]  It's like Obama saying, I'm against this bill and putting letters out saying the secret arrest of citizens disappearing into black holes and worldwide warfare and killing of citizens by the military, that's wrong.
[00:27:15.813 --> 00:27:19.315]  Meanwhile, he was demanding behind the scenes in letters that it be added.
[00:27:22.256 --> 00:27:27.338]  And I guess that was in case it didn't pass, he could then act like he was against it.
[00:27:27.618 --> 00:27:29.899]  But it passed overwhelmingly House and Senate.
[00:27:31.124 --> 00:27:36.648]  And now the New York Times comes out and says, the sound of one president caving.
[00:27:37.628 --> 00:27:45.294]  For a while, the administration encouraged people to think that President Obama would take a stand against the unnecessary and very dangerous provisions that Congress jammed to the
[00:27:46.696 --> 00:27:48.258]  Yesterday, the President backed down completely.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.860]  And announced that they were satisfied.
[00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:13.963]  Yeah, because they changed the bill to say specifically the President is a dictator, not just the entire Department of Defense.
[00:28:14.403 --> 00:28:14.943]  Oh, goody!
[00:28:15.203 --> 00:28:18.244]  The President's the dictator, not just the Secretary of Defense.
[00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:25.026]  I mean, this, it doesn't get any more purebred tyranny than this.
[00:28:25.286 --> 00:28:33.568]  To have a government where the King says he can just say, take this person away, and they disappear for no reason.
[00:28:34.841 --> 00:28:47.327]  I mean, kings, even in the Middle Ages, would have some type of gesticulation and non-sequitur they went through, where they claim there was some process and ceremony before you disappeared into a dungeon.
[00:28:47.347 --> 00:28:55.171]  In fact, they would torture you to go ahead and have you confess, so they'd say, we'll see now, we're going to put you in prison for life or kill you.
[00:28:56.332 --> 00:28:57.593]  It's a complete oxymoron.
[00:28:58.073 --> 00:29:01.755]  And for a while they were saying, we're going to torture you to make you say you're guilty.
[00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:05.356]  And they tried to sell out to the public, and now they're just saying, forget it.
[00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:08.758]  We'll keep torturing, too, because that's what good guys do, of course.
[00:29:09.518 --> 00:29:10.859]  But we're just going to have you disappear.
[00:29:10.899 --> 00:29:11.419]  How's that sound?
[00:29:11.979 --> 00:29:21.243]  And then they've got the military creeping around in every rural area for at least a decade, getting ready for martial law with the FBI commanded by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL.
[00:29:22.163 --> 00:29:28.286]  And now those secret meetings are all public, and they have the Rural Affairs Council, and they're using predator drones on people, farmers.
[00:29:29.688 --> 00:29:30.428]  I mean, it's bad.
[00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:33.350]  I mean, we got bad guys running the country.
[00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.653]  And people are like, well, why are they going to screw the economy up and screw everything up if they're already in control?
[00:29:38.213 --> 00:29:45.117]  Because they like pain and misery and they want to fully break everybody so no one can ever overthrow them.
[00:29:45.897 --> 00:29:47.178]  It's called scorched earth.
[00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:48.219]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.821]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.301 --> 00:29:53.902]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.822 --> 00:29:57.504]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:04.055]  Have you ever wanted to give a gift that expresses faith and liberty?
[00:30:04.255 --> 00:30:06.737]  Those powerful beliefs that shaped our nation at its founding?
[00:30:07.077 --> 00:30:11.580]  If so, pay close attention, because this may be the most important holiday message you'll hear this year.
[00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:13.842]  Beautiful Liberty Blankets are now available.
[00:30:13.882 --> 00:30:17.465]  The Liberty Blanket is made right here in the USA out of all-natural cotton.
[00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:19.126]  It's ultra-soft, ultra-warm,
[00:30:19.266 --> 00:30:24.990]  And designed to remind your friends and loved ones of the enduring values that won the battle for freedom in early America.
[00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.073]  The center of the Liberty Blanket has the words, Appeal to God.
[00:30:28.173 --> 00:30:34.377]  A phrase that Washington and the founders used often as they announced to the world that their rights and liberties came from a sovereign creator.
[00:30:34.497 --> 00:30:38.941]  And in each corner of the Liberty Blanket details one of the pillars of American freedom.
[00:30:39.081 --> 00:30:41.703]  Education, church, civil government, and justice.
[00:30:41.963 --> 00:30:44.406]  Regularly $59.95, now just $39.95.
[00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:50.513]  It's the perfect Christmas gift that helps your friends and family remember our nation's most precious legacy.
[00:30:50.893 --> 00:30:53.656]  To order your Liberty Blanket, go to libertyblanket.com.
[00:30:53.897 --> 00:30:55.458]  That's libertyblanket.com.
[00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:56.119]  Or call 800-209-1258.
[00:30:56.179 --> 00:30:56.359]  That's 800-209-1258.
[00:31:02.577 --> 00:31:04.058]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:04.278 --> 00:31:09.300]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.940]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.904]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:20.644 --> 00:31:27.751]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:28.171 --> 00:31:35.798]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:41.103]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:32:02.483 --> 00:32:06.107]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:09.511]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:14.536]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:32:14.556 --> 00:32:20.803]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:20.943 --> 00:32:23.186]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:23.726 --> 00:32:24.006]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:24.447]  Bernanke?
[00:32:24.527 --> 00:32:25.148]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:25.188 --> 00:32:25.849]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:27.991]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:42.608 --> 00:32:44.449]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:44.749 --> 00:32:49.571]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:32:49.891 --> 00:32:58.995]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:10.606 --> 00:33:11.546]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:16.609]  It is Friday, the 16th day of December 2011.
[00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:19.471]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:26.074]  I'm going to finish up the point I'm making about the total tyrant takeover that's taking place.
[00:33:27.695 --> 00:33:34.999]  And then I'm going to continue getting into some other issues concerning the political campaign that's happening in this nation.
[00:33:37.287 --> 00:33:45.013]  But just now when I said the total tyrant takeover, I hesitated because tyranny is just a word.
[00:33:45.534 --> 00:33:49.717]  Tyrant, traitor, treachery is just a word.
[00:33:50.938 --> 00:33:59.265]  The killing fields of Cambodia with a third of the population killed and giant fields full of skeletons, that
[00:34:01.613 --> 00:34:15.484]  is just words, but to experience being shot and killed, the whole families, to experience what Hitler did, to experience what Stalin did, to experience what all the thousands of tyrants have done throughout history.
[00:34:16.404 --> 00:34:27.433]  And to see this system reconstituting itself, a system of evil, wicked people ruling over us, to see it massing,
[00:34:28.604 --> 00:34:52.232]  And to see the technocrats not just eating around the edges of the Bill of Rights, Constitution, common sense, basic freedom, and to see the United States now a devil on a hill, not a light on a hill, but a evil antenna broadcasting destruction.
[00:34:54.073 --> 00:34:54.993]  To see that happen.
[00:34:56.388 --> 00:35:03.858]  And to see how corrupt and decadent the general public is, the United States is going to turn into a tyranny the likes of which the world has never seen.
[00:35:04.318 --> 00:35:08.884]  Imagine what a Hitler or a Stalin could have done with this country if they controlled it.
[00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:11.205]  And that's basically what's happened.
[00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:13.466]  And these globalists can't help it.
[00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:15.428]  I mean, they're going to take private bank accounts.
[00:35:15.468 --> 00:35:17.009]  They're going to euthanize old people.
[00:35:17.509 --> 00:35:21.371]  They're going to shut down alternative media because we're exposing them.
[00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:23.112]  They're going to start giant new wars.
[00:35:23.813 --> 00:35:26.254]  They're going to blow stuff up and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:35:26.695 --> 00:35:34.960]  I mean, how could anyone in their right mind not know that government stages terror attacks when Gladio's been declassified, Operation Ajax,
[00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:39.612]  Golf of Tonkin, Operation Northwoods.
[00:35:39.632 --> 00:35:42.793]  If you're a new listener and don't know what these things are, write them down and research them.
[00:35:44.113 --> 00:35:44.813]  I don't have time.
[00:35:44.853 --> 00:35:52.776]  There'll be a good football game this weekend with the Broncos and the Patriots.
[00:35:52.836 --> 00:35:53.916]  That's what's really important.
[00:35:53.936 --> 00:35:55.336]  You know, the male soap opera.
[00:35:55.797 --> 00:35:56.357]  Okay, great.
[00:35:56.517 --> 00:35:57.237]  Watch the football.
[00:35:58.917 --> 00:36:00.718]  But this is not a time to be doing that.
[00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:09.184]  And you're having a simulated combat that you watch and, oh, your team won, so the week ahead's gonna be great.
[00:36:10.124 --> 00:36:11.706]  Real evil is massing.
[00:36:13.587 --> 00:36:18.890]  And everything we've seen so far is just probing and beta testing.
[00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:26.836]  As the real onslaught starts moving, it's gonna get more and more intense, faster and faster.
[00:36:27.156 --> 00:36:28.477]  And you're already seeing that.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:58.599]  Eighty of the inventors of the Internet, the engineers, the admitted inventors, the software developers, many of these people, billionaires, have even come out and said, look, this is the end of the Internet, the end of freedom, a global, worldwide treaty, that's what this bill is, is in line with the treaty, to allow the total shutdown of anything selectively, and the militaries of the world domestically running the Internet and hacking it up.
[00:36:58.619 --> 00:36:59.760]  I mean, I read to you the quotes.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.810]  All that's going to be allowed under the
[00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:31.458]  The Internet2 system, the establishment calls it, is certain corridors and maybe a thousand sites or so, that themselves are owned by university governments and a handful of Fortune 100s, who then have sub-sites, and then you have a sub-account with them, and then you waive all your rights to be on that, and other domains, goodbye.
[00:37:31.958 --> 00:37:33.598]  Talk radio, goodbye.
[00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.279]  Goodbye to all of it.
[00:37:36.203 --> 00:37:37.483]  You're like, they'll never get away with that.
[00:37:37.644 --> 00:37:38.044]  Oh yeah?
[00:37:38.404 --> 00:37:39.084]  You just watch.
[00:37:39.544 --> 00:37:46.467]  You wait till Al Qaeda working with a militia, and I know that doesn't make sense, why would right-wingers work with Al Qaeda?
[00:37:46.707 --> 00:37:47.767]  It's not gonna be real.
[00:37:49.668 --> 00:37:54.350]  But you wait till they blow up a big building in Chicago.
[00:37:56.091 --> 00:37:59.452]  You just wait, and it won't matter if it's won on by Larry Silverstein again.
[00:37:59.752 --> 00:38:02.773]  Like the Chicago Sears Tower, formerly Sears Tower.
[00:38:03.153 --> 00:38:04.634]  It won't matter how obvious it is.
[00:38:05.626 --> 00:38:08.007]  They could have the government there with blasting plungers doing it.
[00:38:08.027 --> 00:38:12.308]  I mean, they put the drugged underwear bomber, CIA does, on the plane.
[00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:14.149]  It comes out in congressional testimony.
[00:38:14.429 --> 00:38:17.230]  And the Congress is like, oh, so the government put him on the plane.
[00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.711]  All right, let's move on to the next point.
[00:38:19.031 --> 00:38:20.671]  Oh, and you don't know where the money is, Corzine.
[00:38:20.691 --> 00:38:21.472]  Let's move on to the next point.
[00:38:21.772 --> 00:38:22.092]  Oh, look.
[00:38:22.492 --> 00:38:28.597]  Federal court, government declares national security, admits they ship drugs in and control major cartels and are fighting the other ones.
[00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:33.181]  And the government shipped the guns into Mexico to actually help kill those cartels and blame the Second Amendment.
[00:38:33.641 --> 00:38:34.382]  Let's just move on.
[00:38:34.442 --> 00:38:35.883]  Thank you, Mr. Holder.
[00:38:36.243 --> 00:38:37.744]  You won't be getting in any trouble for that.
[00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:46.311]  And I could just go on and on with how it's just in your face.
[00:38:47.152 --> 00:38:48.613]  You know, I talked about 12 years ago.
[00:38:50.441 --> 00:39:19.191]  And even Bloomberg came out, and AP and Reuters last year, and said there was a deal in 1999 where the top insurance companies met with the Justice Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and they were given an internal executive memorandum from the Department of Defense and from the President, at the time it was Bill Clinton, that they could start taking death benefits from the widows and widowers of service people from World War II through current.
[00:39:20.822 --> 00:39:23.685]  And the people are supposed to get their insurance?
[00:39:23.965 --> 00:39:27.288]  And they get a letter saying you're not getting it, sorry, this new code.
[00:39:27.608 --> 00:39:28.889]  And then it's never even in the news.
[00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:41.241]  And then it comes out and people are like, hey, I don't care if they're taking veterans death benefits, I'm just gonna stick an American flag on my car and run up to people in uniform at the shopping mall and go, oh, I really support your service, thank you.
[00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:43.363]  And it's all like this little fake sick thing they do.
[00:39:45.292 --> 00:39:45.973]  For most people.
[00:39:46.033 --> 00:39:49.275]  I mean, if you supported their service, don't stick them down a meat grinder.
[00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:51.637]  Don't let them breathe DU and not get treatment.
[00:39:52.317 --> 00:39:56.000]  Or let the government use DU without proper decontamination and clothing.
[00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:59.882]  Don't let them be guinea pigs for experimental vaccines.
[00:40:00.403 --> 00:40:02.204]  Actually know about the military.
[00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:04.405]  I mean, that'd be like in Germany.
[00:40:04.686 --> 00:40:05.906]  They said, you gotta support the troops.
[00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:07.568]  Hitler took Germany to war with us.
[00:40:08.915 --> 00:40:10.176]  20 million Germans died total.
[00:40:10.456 --> 00:40:11.416]  Civilian and military.
[00:40:11.917 --> 00:40:14.238]  Like 8 million in their military, 12 million civilians.
[00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:14.838]  Look it up.
[00:40:15.138 --> 00:40:16.539]  Some estimates are as high as 25 million.
[00:40:17.059 --> 00:40:18.299]  Germany was only 60 million.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.981]  That's close to a third of their population.
[00:40:23.482 --> 00:40:25.002]  No, it's even more than that.
[00:40:25.042 --> 00:40:25.763]  It's more than a third.
[00:40:26.904 --> 00:40:27.284]  60 million.
[00:40:27.944 --> 00:40:28.725]  That's close to half.
[00:40:28.965 --> 00:40:30.085]  It was 20 million.
[00:40:30.105 --> 00:40:32.966]  I guess it would be a third if it's 20, but it was 22 or more.
[00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:35.587]  The point is, that's a big part of the population.
[00:40:35.807 --> 00:40:37.887]  And Hitler would always say, support the troops!
[00:40:38.367 --> 00:40:39.408]  Goebbels wrote books on it.
[00:40:39.668 --> 00:40:40.308]  Support them!
[00:40:40.528 --> 00:40:41.508]  Support the war!
[00:40:41.568 --> 00:40:42.389]  Support the troops!
[00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:45.409]  And it's the exact same thing today.
[00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.030]  And again, you're just like the Germans.
[00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.171]  You're not going to recognize it.
[00:40:49.551 --> 00:40:50.331]  I understand that.
[00:40:51.638 --> 00:40:55.521]  Not until there's a nuclear war, not until the globalists release their deadly bioweapon.
[00:40:56.281 --> 00:41:15.155]  And you know, as long as you get right with God as you and your whole family are dying, if we don't stop these people down the road and they release their super bioweapons, like the mousepox that kills 99% of humans it comes in contact with and studies, just at least as you're dying, get right with God.
[00:41:16.503 --> 00:41:37.576]  As your children, your wife are dying around you, you're a tough guy, SWAT team guy who's waged war on the evil patriots and everything, you feel good about yourself, and the globalists are now getting rid of you, just admit you were wrong and repent to God as you vomit your guts out with sores all over your body and pus pouring out of your hind end, and just, just, just repent to God for your sins.
[00:41:38.516 --> 00:41:39.997]  That's going to be the most important thing.
[00:41:40.317 --> 00:41:41.678]  That's the real reason I'm here.
[00:41:42.138 --> 00:41:47.882]  So that all that is going to come, and going to come to pass, you would have been warned, because that's God's rule!
[00:41:48.402 --> 00:41:54.066]  You will be warned first, before you stick your hand in that meat grinder.
[00:41:57.848 --> 00:42:03.332]  There's always time to turn back before the final hammer drops, before the ram hits the wall.
[00:42:04.532 --> 00:42:06.534]  But the ram is getting ready to hit the wall.
[00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:24.786]  And once it hits the wall, all these evil people that brought this in, because they're like moths to a flame, they're evil, they're tuned into that dark wavelength, they think something beautiful's about to happen, and they'll be happy as they're torn limb from limb by the system.
[00:42:25.727 --> 00:42:26.928]  That's, they're of their father!
[00:42:28.229 --> 00:42:28.830]  They like death!
[00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.592]  People are like, what's the New World Order after?
[00:42:31.457 --> 00:42:32.918]  It's not after even global government.
[00:42:32.938 --> 00:42:36.241]  That's just a system to have worldwide persecution and death.
[00:42:36.581 --> 00:42:37.482]  In their own words!
[00:42:38.683 --> 00:42:47.069]  Their philosophers all write about getting rid of all humans and how they're going to transcend with machines and leave the planet and be gods.
[00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:51.333]  I mean, you talk about people being given a delusion by a dark entity.
[00:42:51.633 --> 00:42:53.614]  If they're in the devil, boy, there sure should be.
[00:42:53.635 --> 00:42:56.497]  Because, I mean, only something like pure evil could come up with that.
[00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:12.773]  The globalists are rewriting the genome of the planet and creating abominations that don't even work right, and are all screwed up, and we're given facsimiles of food that only make us ill and bloated, and they're trying to ban real food.
[00:43:12.793 --> 00:43:15.994]  People are like, oh, they're not really trying to do that.
[00:43:16.134 --> 00:43:16.534]  Oh, really?
[00:43:16.554 --> 00:43:18.435]  And they're not really trying to shut down free speech.
[00:43:18.915 --> 00:43:21.656]  AP, AFP, Reuters admitting the end of the internet as you know it.
[00:43:22.196 --> 00:43:24.637]  New York Times going, well, it does allow citizens to disappear.
[00:43:24.657 --> 00:43:26.978]  And the New York Times is like, maybe that's reasonable.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.160]  I mean, go read it.
[00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:37.604]  Now it's like, well, I guess it does affect citizens, but it's what we need, and Obama said he was against it, but it turns out he was behind the scenes for it.
[00:43:38.004 --> 00:43:38.605]  Of course!
[00:43:39.185 --> 00:43:41.446]  Obama is a husk.
[00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:44.388]  He is a vessel of evil.
[00:43:44.448 --> 00:43:45.568]  He isn't even real.
[00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:46.789]  That's what I figured out.
[00:43:47.049 --> 00:43:48.450]  I don't even hate these people anymore.
[00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.271]  I realize they're zombies.
[00:43:51.786 --> 00:43:52.106]  They are!
[00:43:52.386 --> 00:43:54.487]  They are zombies with a heartbeat.
[00:43:54.527 --> 00:43:55.647]  Dick Cheney doesn't have a heartbeat.
[00:43:55.687 --> 00:43:57.688]  He has that bionic heart that's outside.
[00:43:58.248 --> 00:44:03.690]  You can pull it up, AP, Reuters, and Wired Magazine all have the headline, Dick Cheney has no pulse.
[00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.950]  In fact, let's put that up on screen.
[00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:05.631]  People won't believe me.
[00:44:06.251 --> 00:44:12.573]  The point is, is that they're just giving over to their petty evil, and you're not going to be able to help them.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.582]  And I look at all these articles I've got here.
[00:44:17.602 --> 00:44:20.404]  Here's one at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:20.464 --> 00:44:23.326]  DHS aircraft aided in massacre of 73.
[00:44:23.826 --> 00:44:28.070]  Homeland Security surveillance plane helped Jamaican police carry out atrocity.
[00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:35.015]  In Jamaica, trying to cut back on small drug smuggling operations that aren't laundering their money through the globalist operation.
[00:44:35.556 --> 00:44:37.117]  And again, that's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:37.357 --> 00:44:42.281]  That's 100% in Congress, in CIA hearings, since the 60s.
[00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:44.823]  And 70s, 80s, 90s, right through to today.
[00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.272]  Yeah, there's New York Daily News.
[00:44:49.532 --> 00:44:52.476]  Dick Cheney, former vice president, has no pulse.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.704]  He's lived now a year and a half or more with that.
[00:44:58.744 --> 00:45:03.309]  Most people don't live more than six to eight months with it because they get real depressed on having a pulse.
[00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:04.331]  They say Cheney enjoys it.
[00:45:08.067 --> 00:45:09.651]  An undead vice president.
[00:45:10.032 --> 00:45:11.395]  Welcome to Buck Rogers.
[00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:12.357]  Is it 2012 yet?
[00:45:12.437 --> 00:45:14.282]  Oh yeah, it is.
[00:45:14.923 --> 00:45:16.106]  People are like, why do you laugh?
[00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:17.629]  It's Gallo's sick humor.
[00:45:20.066 --> 00:45:23.749]  You see, the globalists teach people to not have rudders or moral compasses.
[00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:25.110]  And I'm not on some high horse here.
[00:45:25.551 --> 00:45:38.882]  The point is that when you have no rudder or no compass, or you hate having a conscience, common sense, instincts, whatever you want to call it, well then, everything automatically steers towards the lowest common denominator.
[00:45:39.702 --> 00:45:45.928]  In culture, in music, in religion, in science, and it just becomes
[00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:50.972]  A hellhole run by the worst of society.
[00:45:52.213 --> 00:45:55.115]  If good people stand down, the most evil take over.
[00:45:56.095 --> 00:45:59.438]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:45:59.858 --> 00:46:08.944]  And when you do nothing, you allow the most evil people out of seven billion people plus.
[00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:12.526]  Seven billion two hundred something thousand, they estimate right now.
[00:46:12.926 --> 00:46:14.467]  As of two days ago, I looked at the latest numbers.
[00:46:15.228 --> 00:46:16.589]  Seven billion
[00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:21.450]  And a couple hundred thousand change out of them.
[00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:31.335]  And the globalists admit in their own book, Rothkopf, Superclass and others, that there's 6,000 super gophers for less than 20 families that run it all.
[00:46:32.216 --> 00:46:42.701]  And those 6,000 gophers will do anything for power, anything for status, anything for chicken feed, fiat money printed up out of nothing.
[00:46:42.741 --> 00:46:45.022]  They will shell their soul for mammon.
[00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:48.012]  But that's the servant class.
[00:46:48.773 --> 00:46:52.756]  The actual dark lords of the New World Order want death.
[00:46:53.777 --> 00:47:01.644]  When you really read their literature, when you really study them, they are like a dimensional gate they're trying to open to unleash absolute death.
[00:47:02.604 --> 00:47:06.708]  They want burned fields, destroyed cities, death.
[00:47:07.168 --> 00:47:08.609]  They want a dead planet.
[00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.513]  The New World Order wants a dead planet at the end of the day.
[00:47:12.693 --> 00:47:13.934]  And I'm telling you that's what's coming.
[00:47:14.254 --> 00:47:15.155]  Because who runs them?
[00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:17.510]  Who runs the New World Order?
[00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:23.434]  If they're ridden a devil, you know what, they might as well be, because the New World Order is into death.
[00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:29.158]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.340]  What does the New World Order do?
[00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:33.381]  What is its fruits?
[00:47:33.762 --> 00:47:38.825]  Killing, stealing, and destroying.
[00:47:39.245 --> 00:47:43.929]  And they sell us on being a bunch of cowards that hide under our tables of boogeymen al-Qaeda,
[00:47:44.773 --> 00:47:49.936]  You know, it's easier to be struck by lightning twice in a year statistically than to be killed by Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:50.377 --> 00:47:59.602]  And then Al-Qaeda publicly works for the big banks and has given Libya and all these countries, and as I said, the underwear bombers put on the plane, and over and over again, all of it the same story I've seen a hundred times.
[00:48:00.463 --> 00:48:08.368]  False flag over and over again, and then I'm the traitor for not being insane like you are, some of you that support this lie.
[00:48:09.232 --> 00:48:11.794]  It's not, I'm the bad man for having courage.
[00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:13.735]  There's no courage in what I'm doing.
[00:48:13.815 --> 00:48:14.796]  I'll explain this to you.
[00:48:15.217 --> 00:48:28.066]  When you really grasp what the New World Order is, it would take the most insane, blind, demonic courage the world has ever seen to not fight this.
[00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:29.767]  Because it's death.
[00:48:30.548 --> 00:48:31.469]  It's destruction.
[00:48:31.789 --> 00:48:32.610]  It's bondage.
[00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:34.211]  You don't make deals with it.
[00:48:35.191 --> 00:48:41.133]  And people slowly thought it was cute to get into corruption, cute to get into laughing at people that were involved and cared.
[00:48:41.513 --> 00:48:42.874]  Oh, look at that kook!
[00:48:46.155 --> 00:48:48.256]  Now people are going to find out it's not funny.
[00:48:48.276 --> 00:48:50.197]  They're going to find out it's not fun.
[00:48:50.217 --> 00:48:53.818]  They're going to find out the wages of corruption.
[00:48:55.158 --> 00:48:56.439]  The fruit of corruption.
[00:48:57.523 --> 00:49:03.545]  The byproduct of not having a Bill of Rights and Constitution and not caring about freedom.
[00:49:04.065 --> 00:49:07.746]  Well, when you don't want freedom and you won't stand up for it, you know what you get?
[00:49:08.006 --> 00:49:09.567]  You know what the opposite of freedom is?
[00:49:11.167 --> 00:49:11.847]  It's slavery.
[00:49:13.048 --> 00:49:23.571]  And they're going to take your time, they're going to take your energy, they're going to take your health, they're going to take your children, they're going to take with the pharmacies and the drugs and the stuff in the water and the food, your very intellect.
[00:49:24.346 --> 00:49:26.087]  They're gonna steal everything from you.
[00:49:26.127 --> 00:49:27.929]  You can see it in the public's eyes right now.
[00:49:28.209 --> 00:49:32.773]  People are either more awake and their eyes are burning with understanding, or they're like zombies.
[00:49:32.813 --> 00:49:33.794]  You can't even get attention.
[00:49:34.194 --> 00:49:38.237]  You can't even get to see what you're doing.
[00:49:38.277 --> 00:49:40.239]  You can't even get them to give you their attention.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:48.565]  Because they have just... Because if you don't see what's going on around you, it means you've given in to greater and greater degrees of lies.
[00:49:49.403 --> 00:50:02.847]  You've rationalized so many things so many times that you now are completely, by your own incremental success of approximation, not even conscious anymore.
[00:50:04.728 --> 00:50:08.689]  You've had your free will sucked out of you.
[00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.930]  Stolen!
[00:50:11.891 --> 00:50:19.275]  Now, there's always a seed of free will left, unless you've totally, willfully turned yourself over to evil.
[00:50:22.717 --> 00:50:24.798]  But as for me, I want God in my life.
[00:50:24.958 --> 00:50:29.240]  I want the Holy Spirit, if you want to call it, in my life.
[00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:31.882]  I want God in my life.
[00:50:32.002 --> 00:50:37.305]  I recognize that the surface of evil that looks sexy and powerful is not.
[00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:40.380]  It's easy to kill.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.981]  It's hard to create.
[00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:45.683]  Creation is beautiful.
[00:50:46.584 --> 00:50:48.005]  Life and love is power.
[00:50:50.446 --> 00:50:52.188]  Not some hydrogen bomb.
[00:50:53.028 --> 00:51:00.694]  We come back, Ron Paul demonized and attacked by the Stepford wife, Lord Bachman, the witch of war.
[00:51:01.775 --> 00:51:07.518]  When the food collapse happens, if trucks stop delivering food to supermarket shelves tomorrow, what will you do?
[00:51:07.999 --> 00:51:10.580]  How well is your family prepared for a food crisis?
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.401]  How long will you survive?
[00:51:13.062 --> 00:51:20.966]  Getting a biodome which produces food for you and your family year-round, even in the dead of winter, is easy, cheap, and extremely liberating.
[00:51:21.247 --> 00:51:24.649]  Find out how in an all-new webinar at domerevolution.com.

[00:51:40.526 --> 00:51:41.327]  I think so.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.285]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible to shop for?

[00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.291]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'll like to catch.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.082]  Yeah, sometimes Satan!
[00:54:21.222 --> 00:54:26.105]  First he's in the back, now he's in the front.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.141]  Yeah, sometimes Satan.
[00:54:44.621 --> 00:54:47.021]  Alright, my friends.
[00:55:10.495 --> 00:55:17.680]  Michelle Bachmann is a intelligent, attractive woman who's pro-Second Amendment.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.022]  She's certainly better than somebody like Newt Gingrich.
[00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:27.306]  But on the issue of war, she is a very dangerous person.
[00:55:29.007 --> 00:55:33.329]  And they lied to us and said Iraq could blow up England in 45 minutes and attack the U.S.
[00:55:33.369 --> 00:55:34.030]  and had to be attacked.
[00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:34.850]  It was all a lie.
[00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:38.433]  Now they've just changed the last letter in the word Iraq
[00:55:39.534 --> 00:55:40.376]  We're good to go.
[00:55:52.236 --> 00:56:02.505]  And so they're having Michelle Bachmann and Rush Limbaugh and the neocons all come out against him as if he's horrible because he doesn't want to attack Iran, he wants them to nuke us.
[00:56:03.066 --> 00:56:06.689]  Now remember, 60 plus percent of Israelis in major polls are against it.
[00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:08.831]  The Jerusalem Post and others have reported.
[00:56:09.892 --> 00:56:15.077]  Netanyahu had to fire the head of the Mossad and the military, what was it, about a year ago, because they're against it.
[00:56:15.537 --> 00:56:17.459]  And they've come out and said it'll be a catastrophe.
[00:56:19.508 --> 00:56:23.950]  Our own CIA, who I'm certainly not defending, has come out and said it's a bad idea.
[00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.411]  The Secretary of Defense has said it's a bad idea.
[00:56:26.851 --> 00:56:28.992]  Why are they saying Ron Paul is bad?
[00:56:30.312 --> 00:56:31.633]  Because they're scared of him, folks.
[00:56:31.993 --> 00:56:33.113]  They know he's a patriot.
[00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:36.795]  They know he's a level-headed doctor and a scholar.
[00:56:37.657 --> 00:56:38.858]  Who's not radical at all.
[00:56:39.538 --> 00:56:40.499]  Hey, let's not torture.
[00:56:40.539 --> 00:56:41.439]  Let's have the Bill of Rights.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.281]  Let's not have citizens secretly arrested.
[00:56:43.501 --> 00:56:47.883]  Let's not have the government censor the internet and take control of it and have the Pentagon run kill switches.
[00:56:48.544 --> 00:56:49.725]  Let's not have all this happen.
[00:56:49.925 --> 00:56:51.806]  And they go, that's crazy!
[00:56:52.746 --> 00:56:56.609]  And then Botman misrepresents what Ron Paul is really saying.
[00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:59.751]  Let's go ahead and play the short clip of this exchange last night in the debate.
[00:57:01.857 --> 00:57:14.086]  And the problem would be the greatest underreaction in world history if we have an avowed madman who uses that nuclear weapon to wipe nations off the face of the earth.
[00:57:14.386 --> 00:57:24.172]  And we have an IAEA report that just recently came out that said literally Iran is within just months of being able to obtain that weapon.
[00:57:24.533 --> 00:57:27.535]  Nothing could be more dangerous than the comments that we just heard.
[00:57:28.035 --> 00:57:30.996]  There is no UN report that said that.
[00:57:31.016 --> 00:57:33.717]  It's totally wrong on what you just said.
[00:57:33.897 --> 00:57:35.577]  It's an IAEA report.
[00:57:35.597 --> 00:57:36.578]  That is not true.
[00:57:36.958 --> 00:57:41.379]  They produced information that led you to believe that, but they have no evidence.
[00:57:41.399 --> 00:57:43.620]  There's been no enrichment.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:50.310]  And if we agree with that, if we agree with that, the United States people could be at risk of our national security.
[00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:52.213]  She took my time, so I'd like to finish.
[00:57:52.473 --> 00:57:59.444]  If she thinks we live in a dangerous world, she ought to think back when I was drafted in 1962 with the nuclear missiles in Cuba.
[00:58:00.084 --> 00:58:00.564]  All right.
[00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:31.120]  And the rest of the clips at Infowars.com.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:31.640]  But you heard her.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.000]  We could be at risk.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:38.681]  We're at risk of a tyrannical government that's butchering the Bill of Rights and robbing us right now.
[00:58:38.701 --> 00:58:48.264]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.638 --> 00:58:52.819]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:59.025]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.

[00:59:56.918 --> 00:59:59.679]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[01:00:06.328 --> 01:00:06.969]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:08.671]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:10.513]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.173 --> 01:00:11.974]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.755 --> 01:00:13.676]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.297 --> 01:00:17.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:22.565]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.756 --> 01:00:39.087]  Alright, we're now into hour number two, coming up in the next segment and into the next hour, we're going to talk to the makers of A Noble Lie, really the first ever professionally made film just about Oklahoma City and that staged false flag terror attack.
[01:00:39.107 --> 01:00:53.137]  It's available at Infowars.com and if you order it, I should have added even in the last hour, Sunday is the last day to get your orders in for the Everything Special or Noble Lie or any other books and videos, t-shirts that you want to have as Christmas presents.
[01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.721]  And support the broadcast, the new InfoWars flag, all of it.
[01:00:58.101 --> 01:01:02.505]  Sunday's the last day to get it in and have it guaranteed delivered to you before Christmas.
[01:01:03.446 --> 01:01:07.229]  Now, a lot of areas in the U.S., you'll still get it if you order it on Monday or whatever.
[01:01:07.249 --> 01:01:10.031]  And everything that comes in until about Monday morning, we're gonna get shipped out Monday.
[01:01:11.352 --> 01:01:13.254]  So, Sunday is the last day.
[01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:22.762]  So, if you're listening to this rebroadcast on stations over the weekend or whatever, and you wanna give the gift of truth this holiday season and support the InfoWars operation, we've got all of my films.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.621]  That's all of them.
[01:01:25.423 --> 01:01:32.434]  All 18 of my documentaries that are on DVD and bumper stickers, the In The Fed and Infowars.com bumper sticker citizen rule book.
[01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:33.816]  All of it.
[01:01:37.478 --> 01:01:42.442]  All of it for $99.95 instead of the normal $360.
[01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:49.387]  And your purchase makes the broadcast possible, so please spread the word about the special.
[01:01:49.407 --> 01:01:51.248]  And why go out and fight the insane traffic?
[01:01:51.649 --> 01:01:53.170]  I tell you, I've just been going home.
[01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:58.654]  You know, when I do go home, a lot of times I don't work until 7, 8, 9, 10 at night.
[01:01:58.694 --> 01:02:00.856]  When I do go home a little bit earlier, I just go home.
[01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:06.401]  I'm not out there battling the insane Christmas traffic to give people Christmas presents.
[01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:12.767]  We're just painting photos and seashells we've gathered over the years at the lakeside.
[01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:21.907]  Lake Travis has these beautiful big shells, and at the Salt Sea, and painting those and things, and making soap to give as gifts, little family events.
[01:02:22.668 --> 01:02:24.708]  I mean, that's what Christmas is about, is about family events.
[01:02:24.748 --> 01:02:31.631]  But if you're going to go out and buy a bunch of stuff, why not give the gift of truth, and have a win-win-win-win-win there, and support the Infowar.
[01:02:31.991 --> 01:02:33.532]  Get 18 DVDs, 18 films, 18 different gifts.
[01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.094]  For $99.95.
[01:02:37.794 --> 01:02:39.816]  Or get a Noble Live for $19.95.
[01:02:39.876 --> 01:02:42.198]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[01:02:43.219 --> 01:02:44.260]  How much are we selling that for?
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:44.680]  I forget.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.821]  You support the filmmakers.
[01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:49.224]  And then you also support our operation too.
[01:02:49.864 --> 01:02:51.966]  If we just go to the shopping cart, you can tell me what it is.
[01:02:52.366 --> 01:02:53.547]  I forget what we're selling it for.
[01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.830]  We're tied up on both computers because we're getting them punched up on the Skype.
[01:02:58.251 --> 01:03:00.292]  Anyways, the point is, it's up there as well.
[01:03:00.352 --> 01:03:00.813]  New film.
[01:03:01.573 --> 01:03:03.335]  And why is Oklahoma City so important?
[01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:08.694]  I'll talk more about that when we come back from break and actually talk about the film some more there.
[01:03:08.714 --> 01:03:11.462]  Of course I'm interviewed in it, but...
[01:03:12.884 --> 01:03:13.705]  That's the least of it.
[01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.627]  They've talked to survivors, eyewitnesses, all of it.
[01:03:16.707 --> 01:03:17.908]  It's very important people see this.
[01:03:18.308 --> 01:03:22.592]  Because the system has put out all these memos and reports.
[01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.593]  In fact, I intend to do a little news piece on this.
[01:03:24.633 --> 01:03:25.554]  I've done previous ones.
[01:03:25.874 --> 01:03:28.156]  Even Glenn Beck came out and said the government's getting ready.
[01:03:28.176 --> 01:03:29.377]  Remember last year?
[01:03:29.957 --> 01:03:30.518]  Late last year?
[01:03:30.838 --> 01:03:34.161]  The government's getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City and blame it on me.
[01:03:34.841 --> 01:03:35.622]  He said himself.
[01:03:36.262 --> 01:03:38.104]  But in those memos and in those reports,
[01:03:43.038 --> 01:03:46.359]  They, if you go to the front page of the site, you'll be able to pull it up.
[01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:49.160]  That's a combo one we were showing.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.241]  You just want to go to the front page.
[01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:50.961]  It's on the front page.
[01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.441]  It's $19.95.
[01:03:52.481 --> 01:03:52.801]  Thank you.
[01:03:55.662 --> 01:03:57.283]  And I don't even like having to sit up here.
[01:03:57.303 --> 01:03:58.303]  I mean, it gets the films out.
[01:03:58.343 --> 01:03:59.084]  It gets the word out.
[01:03:59.124 --> 01:04:01.324]  It wakes people up.
[01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:03.125]  But
[01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:09.670]  I don't even like having to fill our tanks in the Info War and sell things.
[01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.730]  But I mean, other revolutionaries rob banks.
[01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:12.411]  We don't do that.
[01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:15.451]  We just sell things we believe in that helps get the word out.
[01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:17.572]  Books, videos, t-shirts, things like that.
[01:04:17.852 --> 01:04:22.573]  These are weapons in the Info War, and you can see how far we have come.
[01:04:23.553 --> 01:04:25.954]  But it wasn't just Glenn Beck that we're getting ready to set up for it.
[01:04:27.874 --> 01:04:29.416]  I was in those articles he was talking about.
[01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:33.321]  They were getting ready to blame Glenn Beck, myself, and others.
[01:04:34.282 --> 01:04:41.851]  And people who are great patriots and bold and fight hard for freedom, but I used the term for Sheriff Mack yesterday, of milquetoast compared to some of us.
[01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:46.617]  Of course, he's not milquetoast, but I meant compared to some of the wild stuff out there, he's very tame.
[01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:50.109]  Um, nobody corrected me on milquetoast.
[01:04:50.149 --> 01:04:51.370]  I thought, I called him milquetoast.
[01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.071]  Let me look that up.
[01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:53.212]  That means timid.
[01:04:53.712 --> 01:04:54.814]  I went, no, he's not timid.
[01:04:55.114 --> 01:04:57.076]  So I retract the milquetoast statement.
[01:04:57.616 --> 01:04:59.759]  Genteel and friendly.
[01:05:01.605 --> 01:05:02.747]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:02.787 --> 01:05:09.456]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:09.717 --> 01:05:12.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:17.448]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:17.628 --> 01:05:20.409]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:20.669 --> 01:05:22.790]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:28.913]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:29.253 --> 01:05:32.434]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:32.614 --> 01:05:38.157]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:39.717]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:40.038 --> 01:05:41.278]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:43.899]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:44.019 --> 01:05:45.440]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.062]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:48.242 --> 01:05:52.746]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:52.846 --> 01:05:55.309]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:06:02.372 --> 01:06:03.854]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:04.074 --> 01:06:09.121]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:09.381 --> 01:06:10.723]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:10.924 --> 01:06:19.715]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:20.436 --> 01:06:27.539]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:27.959 --> 01:06:35.583]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:35.983 --> 01:06:40.905]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:43.366]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:07:01.078 --> 01:07:06.821]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible to shop for?
[01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:14.324]  How would you like the ability to get top-of-the-line, hard-to-find gifts at equally hard-to-beat prices without leaving the comfort of your home?
[01:07:14.744 --> 01:07:15.664]  Why fight the crowd?

[01:07:45.245 --> 01:07:47.167]  A gift that could truly make a difference.

[01:07:55.459 --> 01:07:56.301]  No more searching.

[01:07:58.125 --> 01:07:59.388]  That's OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:10.634]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.075]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:13.716]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.396 --> 01:08:18.039]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.599 --> 01:08:22.642]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:35.067]  Well, they're going after Sheriff Arpaio in Arizona, and you can say what you want about the guy, but he's not violating federal law, arresting illegal aliens.
[01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:37.950]  But see, the feds won't enforce federal law.
[01:08:38.951 --> 01:08:46.918]  The illegals come here and get free education, free healthcare, everything, and that's not enough because the globalists want to drive down Americans' wages.
[01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:51.154]  Mexico's a failed narco-terrorist state.
[01:08:51.234 --> 01:08:54.617]  Our own government's been caught shipping guns in and drugs out.
[01:08:55.297 --> 01:09:00.262]  Oh, but that's not violating federal law, because the Attorney General's the one giving the orders, and why?
[01:09:00.282 --> 01:09:01.423]  He's above the law.
[01:09:02.543 --> 01:09:07.585]  And I guess Corzine's a former governor so he can take your private bank accounts and get caught lying about it.
[01:09:08.165 --> 01:09:17.428]  This is the world we live in where they admit they're getting ready to pass laws to shut down the internet selectively and ban any website or any speech.
[01:09:17.828 --> 01:09:23.970]  They have algorithms where they can put programs in to ban my voice worldwide from the internet.
[01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:27.591]  Similar to programs they have like Shazam.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.460]  I don't know.
[01:09:51.005 --> 01:10:08.372]  An international distributor of it ran its audio through their systems, and now you try to upload 30 seconds of it to the web, and I had to call them, and they're moving to correct it, because the whole catalog of what they distribute, they're now claiming copyright on, even though they don't have the copyright, and blocking it.
[01:10:09.252 --> 01:10:12.573]  And I called them again on Monday, or was it Tuesday, and we're fixing that.
[01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:18.196]  And that's what the hoops had to jump through just to get it distributed in some stores, was that now,
[01:10:19.324 --> 01:10:28.467]  Even though my contract with the distributor says I can put this on the internet and give it away for free, they can just sell DVDs of it, and they can sell downloads of it.
[01:10:30.767 --> 01:10:33.208]  It doesn't matter that this is a perfect example of this.
[01:10:34.008 --> 01:10:42.251]  The computer itself, when it goes up on YouTube, is scanning the audio, not music, the audio of my voice and saying, you can't have that.
[01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:46.692]  That's just a little example of how they can censor and control things.
[01:10:47.492 --> 01:10:59.302]  And the 80 inventors of the Internet, again, are all over the news in a public letter, saying this is the end of the Internet as we know it, and that the United States will be seen as a pusher of authoritarianism worldwide.
[01:10:59.783 --> 01:11:03.346]  Which it is, because America has been hijacked.
[01:11:04.367 --> 01:11:06.408]  And I know I repeat that over and over again, but it's very, very simple.
[01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:08.150]  This isn't our government.
[01:11:09.671 --> 01:11:17.876]  Later in the next hour, if I have time, I'll play that scene in Network, where Howard Beale gets called in by the head of the big umbrella combine, the big megacorporation.
[01:11:18.396 --> 01:11:20.238]  And he says, you think there's countries, Mr. Beale?
[01:11:20.538 --> 01:11:21.578]  There are no nations.
[01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:25.541]  There are only megacorporations and the fiat currency we issue.
[01:11:26.141 --> 01:11:27.282]  And that's how they see it.
[01:11:27.682 --> 01:11:29.703]  And so we don't have rights, we don't have liberties.
[01:11:30.104 --> 01:11:36.388]  You get the documents from a North American union or an EU meeting, it's Fortune 100 there and the megabanks.
[01:11:37.068 --> 01:11:39.690]  The G20 telling the countries what to do.
[01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:45.995]  So we're already in this global corporate government and we're seeing what they do.
[01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:56.985]  Steal pension funds, debase currencies, deploy militaries against the people from Australia, to Canada, to the U.S., the military on the streets.
[01:11:57.665 --> 01:12:04.030]  Oh, just helping, you know, at this city event, or just searching people with the high school football gamer, just running a DUI checkpointer.
[01:12:04.251 --> 01:12:05.692]  Oh, the Army's here to help at a car wreck.
[01:12:07.237 --> 01:12:09.800]  Now they say that was all acclamation, as I told you it was.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.602]  Now we're going to secretly arrest you and kill you if we want.
[01:12:14.784 --> 01:12:20.430]  And the media is having to deal with it and go, yeah, it is kind of like North Korea, but gee, those terrorists are scary.
[01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:24.393]  The terrorists that publicly work for the government.
[01:12:25.034 --> 01:12:26.696]  The terrorists that have been given control of Libya.
[01:12:28.422 --> 01:12:50.417]  You know, how do the good ol' boys that love getting scared of Al-Qaeda and love talking about glass parking lotting anybody who's got brown skin, because that's patriotic, and festooning themselves with American flags as what the flag symbolizes is dying, how are they going to feel as they discover in the internal manuals, but now it's going to be actually acted upon, that they are the terrorist?
[01:12:52.005 --> 01:12:57.929]  They're going to run up and curl up around the black uniform thugs and report on their neighbors to prove how good they are.
[01:12:57.989 --> 01:12:59.770]  That's what they're going to do, because they're not Americans.
[01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:01.291]  They're not free humans.
[01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.072]  They are slave lovers.
[01:13:03.552 --> 01:13:09.056]  They are groveling, sycophantic people who enjoy servitude and bondage.
[01:13:09.276 --> 01:13:10.177]  And I say, fine.
[01:13:10.457 --> 01:13:13.719]  If that's what you want, declare yourselves, be conscious about it.
[01:13:14.199 --> 01:13:22.341]  And forget that we were your brethren, forget that we were your countrymen, crouch down, lick the hand that feeds you, may the chains sit lightly upon you.
[01:13:23.861 --> 01:13:32.122]  And see how it works out for you, just telling absolute global psychopaths who compete with each other to prove who's the most evil and ruthless.
[01:13:32.983 --> 01:13:34.763]  I think it's real cute what they're doing.
[01:13:35.443 --> 01:13:40.704]  Try, try laying down to them so they can walk on you and see how they treat you.
[01:13:41.977 --> 01:13:46.801]  See, I've studied history, I've studied common sense, I've studied human nature, and I've studied these current globalists.
[01:13:47.261 --> 01:13:58.291]  And they are the most nasty, vicious, anti-human, wicked, bloodthirsty, sadomasochistic control freaks you have ever seen in history.
[01:13:59.131 --> 01:14:00.593]  And they got a high-tech posse.
[01:14:01.453 --> 01:14:04.356]  And they got drones killing people worldwide, including in Jamaica.
[01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:06.137]  DHS is worldwide.
[01:14:06.778 --> 01:14:07.739]  Seventy-plus people.
[01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.080]  Infowars.com right now.
[01:14:10.168 --> 01:14:14.270]  And they're going to surveil people that don't want to, you know, get off their farms.
[01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:23.215]  And they're going to be... The new Rural Affairs Council is under the Department of Defense and Homeland Security and says, the military will be deployed into your town.
[01:14:23.975 --> 01:14:26.036]  Everybody's been trained to just see U.S.
[01:14:26.077 --> 01:14:27.897]  military troops and, thank you for your service!
[01:14:27.978 --> 01:14:28.858]  Oh, I love you so much!
[01:14:29.238 --> 01:14:30.499]  Oh yeah, an occupying army.
[01:14:32.188 --> 01:14:35.809]  And if they can buffalo us and sell us on accepting this, it's over.
[01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:40.991]  Now, I wanted to preface going to our guest, who'll be with us for the next hour, because it's such a big deal.
[01:14:42.432 --> 01:14:44.292]  And Paul Watson's written articles about this.
[01:14:44.432 --> 01:14:47.574]  I've written articles and done countless reports on it last year.
[01:14:48.114 --> 01:14:51.315]  When Robert Shapiro came out,
[01:14:52.992 --> 01:15:01.299]  In the Financial Times of London and said, in fact, pull up Robert Shapiro quote for me, just type Robert Shapiro quote about New Oklahoma City and it'll pull Financial Times of London.
[01:15:01.579 --> 01:15:03.800]  It'll pull up our articles with links to it and it's halfway down the page.
[01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:15.009]  He's got an article in the Financial Times of London and he says, barring a new 9-11 or Oklahoma City event to rally support for the President, he's not going to be re-elected, his agenda's going to stall.
[01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:18.152]  Then all these other advisors come out and say the same thing.
[01:15:18.812 --> 01:15:25.998]  Then they start circulating private letters that Beck got saying, yeah, Alex Jones, Glenn Beck, you know, it'll be blamed on them when it happens.
[01:15:26.558 --> 01:15:33.444]  They are within one Bible page thin, see-through membrane of admitting they're going to stage it.
[01:15:33.484 --> 01:15:34.745]  It's like, man, it's really going to help us.
[01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:35.725]  It's going to happen soon.
[01:15:36.066 --> 01:15:37.607]  It's going to be blamed on domestic groups.
[01:15:37.647 --> 01:15:39.128]  We're going to really use this to take over.
[01:15:40.289 --> 01:15:43.632]  So that's why Oklahoma City is so important.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:58.339]  That's why it's such a big deal, because they're now re-invoking it, they're now bringing it back up, and when Nightline comes and interviews me, or MSNBC, or newspapers call me constantly, they say, are you going to cause a new Oklahoma City?
[01:15:59.298 --> 01:16:03.061]  And I say, number one, I'm exposing corruption in government, so justice be done where the heavens fall.
[01:16:03.301 --> 01:16:05.043]  But I'm not calling for offensive action.
[01:16:05.403 --> 01:16:16.332]  I'm here to wake people up and have a moral discussion about this, and reach out to the so-called enforcers, police and military, and ask them, do you want to make the mistake the Germans did, or the Soviets did, or others?
[01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:21.016]  Or do you want to say no like the East Germans did when the Berlin Wall came down?
[01:16:22.117 --> 01:16:22.718]  And stand down?
[01:16:26.095 --> 01:16:30.580]  And so that's the issue, that's the crossroads that we're at right here.
[01:16:31.501 --> 01:16:37.248]  And only by pointing out historically what's happening, and we told you they'd get rid of the law to use the military on the streets.
[01:16:37.689 --> 01:16:39.851]  We told you they'd have indefinite detention for citizens.
[01:16:40.152 --> 01:16:42.434]  We told you they'd use those predator drones on citizens.
[01:16:42.835 --> 01:16:46.139]  Because I've been to the drills, I've read the manuals, it's public.
[01:16:47.808 --> 01:16:49.190]  None of it has to do with Al-Qaeda.
[01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:53.254]  Al-Qaeda, boys and girls, works for the New World Order on record.
[01:16:53.514 --> 01:16:58.259]  The big corporations that sit above us, that are using them as the pretext to get us to give up our liberties.
[01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:06.808]  But now that we're awake and Congress has a 9% approval rating, they don't want the public to fully awake to just how criminal this ruling class is.
[01:17:09.372 --> 01:17:11.673]  And so, they are just going to come right out.
[01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.654]  We're going to shut down internet selectively.
[01:17:13.994 --> 01:17:15.255]  Selective internet kill switch.
[01:17:15.855 --> 01:17:16.956]  Now that's the admitted model.
[01:17:17.356 --> 01:17:19.457]  Chinese communist censorship model.
[01:17:19.877 --> 01:17:21.718]  We're going to take your pension funds if we want.
[01:17:21.918 --> 01:17:23.159]  We're going to take your bank accounts.
[01:17:23.279 --> 01:17:24.159]  Already doing it in Europe.
[01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:25.040]  Private bank accounts.
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:25.980]  Private pension funds.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.881]  We're going to set up checkpoints.
[01:17:27.901 --> 01:17:33.584]  We're going to have citizen leaders that wear little uniforms and report on their neighbors if they're talking bad about the government.
[01:17:33.784 --> 01:17:35.165]  They're having meetings all over the country.
[01:17:35.185 --> 01:17:35.445]  They're now
[01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:37.325]  Leaking, because people are there at them?
[01:17:37.546 --> 01:17:39.946]  Where the sheriffs are there with the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center?
[01:17:40.266 --> 01:17:42.067]  Shane, does your neighbor talk bad about the government?
[01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:43.767]  Do they talk about smaller government?
[01:17:44.008 --> 01:17:44.948]  They are terrorists.
[01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:46.428]  We want you to spy on them.
[01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:54.531]  I mean, this is a to-the-max, creepy, out-of-control, systematic, conscious authoritarian overthrow.
[01:17:55.231 --> 01:17:59.273]  By a CIA run by foreign banks that's done this in countless other countries.
[01:17:59.793 --> 01:18:02.534]  And it's taken its time to get us into derivatives debt.
[01:18:02.894 --> 01:18:04.475]  To set up the giant prison grids.
[01:18:04.535 --> 01:18:06.336]  Now the memos go out, just got chills.
[01:18:06.756 --> 01:18:08.357]  To start staffing the FEMA camps.
[01:18:08.957 --> 01:18:12.919]  Came out yesterday, DHS says get ready for massive influx of immigrants.
[01:18:13.159 --> 01:18:14.840]  Just turn on the emergency centers.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.781]  That's their cover, just like in Rex 84 in the 80s.
[01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:19.895]  But we can back this off.
[01:18:20.275 --> 01:18:21.797]  Tyrants try, try again.
[01:18:21.817 --> 01:18:26.442]  And they're trying to finagle and sell all this right now because they're scared.
[01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.544]  They always had this as contingency plans.
[01:18:28.764 --> 01:18:30.486]  They wanted to take us over softly.
[01:18:31.387 --> 01:18:34.871]  But they had it as contingency plans that if we woke up, so they don't go to prison.
[01:18:35.993 --> 01:18:38.714]  And now they're going, OK, do we use the martial law?
[01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.574]  Do we go ahead and stage domestic stuff?
[01:18:40.835 --> 01:18:42.015]  We've done it a few other times.
[01:18:42.075 --> 01:18:43.435]  It hadn't worked too well for us.
[01:18:43.975 --> 01:18:46.476]  It works at first, but then it only wakes more of them up later.
[01:18:46.916 --> 01:18:48.657]  And they're telling them, we don't have a choice.
[01:18:49.137 --> 01:18:50.978]  You think it's just going to be Corzine going to prison?
[01:18:51.418 --> 01:18:52.318]  It's going to be all of them.
[01:18:54.439 --> 01:18:56.559]  And so they're looking at it right now, and they go, what do we do?
[01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.380]  We start a big regional war.
[01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:02.104]  That'll get them to rally around the government and do what they're told.
[01:19:02.345 --> 01:19:04.066]  We'll do some domestic staged events.
[01:19:04.366 --> 01:19:09.569]  We'll have more PR with the military on the streets, you know, getting puppy dogs out of sewers and kittens out of trees.
[01:19:09.869 --> 01:19:11.010]  Literally that type of stuff.
[01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:14.392]  Showed to you yesterday, you know, the jaws of life, the army helping.
[01:19:14.812 --> 01:19:21.237]  We gotta acclimate, we gotta move forward, intensify the brainwashing, and just go for broke, hide it in plain view.
[01:19:22.116 --> 01:19:23.136]  And the memos keep coming out.
[01:19:23.597 --> 01:19:25.778]  Oklahoma City, it'll help us, it'll help us, it'll help us.
[01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:39.324]  And when they do, New Oklahoma City's folks, remember, they think you're so stupid, they lobby for it publicly, with one micron away from saying they did the last one.
[01:19:40.194 --> 01:19:41.114]  Or that they're gonna do this one.
[01:19:41.774 --> 01:19:47.176]  And the Attorney General who's in charge right now ran the cover-up of Oklahoma City and knew full well what happened.
[01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.236]  And you know what that means.
[01:19:48.756 --> 01:19:53.497]  A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 1995, the new film, the only modern film on the attacks.
[01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:54.538]  Incredible.
[01:19:54.818 --> 01:19:56.438]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:56.678 --> 01:19:59.439]  We'll talk to the producer and director straight ahead.

[01:23:03.427 --> 01:23:07.570]  Burglars love easy targets, like a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:09.971]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.654]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:23:14.054 --> 01:23:20.938]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:25.381]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:23:25.602 --> 01:23:32.326]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:23:32.606 --> 01:23:34.167]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[01:23:55.774 --> 01:23:58.435]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[01:24:32.597 --> 01:24:43.347]  There is the Financial Times article, Obama Faces Growing Credibility Crisis, and you scroll down and there's the quote.
[01:24:43.748 --> 01:24:51.455]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership, says Rob Shapiro, another former Clinton official and supporter of Mr. Obama.
[01:24:51.955 --> 01:24:54.077]  He has to find some way between now and November.
[01:24:54.718 --> 01:24:55.318]  That's coming up.
[01:24:56.152 --> 01:24:56.592]  I don't know.
[01:25:19.855 --> 01:25:25.177]  A lot of other... Jane Graham, who was a witness to what happened working in HUD, is in it.
[01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:31.219]  Terrence Yakey's mother, the police officer who found out the truth that they killed and tortured, is in it.
[01:25:31.419 --> 01:25:32.639]  Look, they're with us.
[01:25:32.659 --> 01:25:33.500]  I'm going to have them break it down.
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.900]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.182]  The reason it's important is there's no film made that's just about it.
[01:25:40.822 --> 01:25:43.664]  Just about Oklahoma City in the last decade or so.
[01:25:44.124 --> 01:25:48.707]  And there's no film that's been modernly produced with all the latest info.
[01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:52.730]  And the gentlemen that we have on have been researching this for many, many years.
[01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:53.390]  I mean, I know that...
[01:25:54.537 --> 01:25:58.479]  Chris Henry, I've been seeing him investigate this for at least, it's got to be close to a decade.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:02.302]  So I think in this short segment, why is this important to you?
[01:26:02.362 --> 01:26:03.463]  You guys live in Oklahoma.
[01:26:03.703 --> 01:26:04.964]  How did you get started on it?
[01:26:04.984 --> 01:26:10.307]  And I think it's important to then break down what we really know about Oklahoma and then see if you agree with me.
[01:26:10.747 --> 01:26:14.850]  It's important to get this out now because people need to understand when they stage another one.
[01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:24.074]  They're going to use it against the good people in America, and exposing this may stop them from staging a new Oklahoma City.
[01:26:24.674 --> 01:26:25.395]  Go ahead, gentlemen.
[01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:29.456]  Absolutely, Alex, and that's one thing that we saw with the underwear bomber.
[01:26:29.516 --> 01:26:38.240]  Kurt Haskell, in his first radio interview, said that he knew that there was something wrong with the official story of 9-11, and he was determined not to allow a cover-up to happen with the underwear bomber.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.662]  So I think that that shows that we are having an effect, you know, the entire
[01:26:42.142 --> 01:26:42.442]  I'm good.
[01:26:57.213 --> 01:27:17.092]  What you're going to get from this documentary is information, whether you know everything about the Oklahoma City bombing or nothing, you're going to walk away with something new because we cover the information that was garnered in the early years of the investigation from the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee and then we get further into it with the new information that's come out from Jesse Trinidou and his FOIA requests.
[01:27:22.794 --> 01:27:38.898]  One good perspective we get on this Alex is that here's a whole new generation that has literally grown up since the event happened and they are the ones that the seeds are being planted on by the corrupt people such as Mr. Shapiro, our current administration, Eric Holder, these people
[01:27:39.498 --> 01:27:42.761]  Wake up in the morning and have no compunction with lying about this case.
[01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.983]  It's just absolutely shocking and disgusting.
[01:27:45.023 --> 01:27:56.012]  What we want to do is present the generation that was living at the time and the new generation with the correct information so they can make sound decisions and realize, you know what, we're still being lied to about this case.
[01:27:56.052 --> 01:27:59.315]  And that's why the truth is still important, you know, almost 17 years after the fact.
[01:27:59.355 --> 01:28:01.477]  These people are still in positions of power today.
[01:28:01.858 --> 01:28:04.520]  They still have the ability to perpetrate another event like this.
[01:28:04.921 --> 01:28:12.108]  And this is what we're trying to hope for here with the movie, is to get some justice, you know, the deserved administering of punishment to the people that were involved.
[01:28:12.468 --> 01:28:14.490]  That's why we chose the title, A Noble Lie.
[01:28:14.791 --> 01:28:16.833]  That's from Plato's The Republic.
[01:28:17.233 --> 01:28:17.333]  It's
[01:28:34.099 --> 01:28:37.680]  Great movement at that time against globalization.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.941]  All of the agenda was completely stalled.
[01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:44.362]  You had patriots all over the country that were trying to restore the Constitution.
[01:28:45.063 --> 01:28:48.244]  There was legislation that was trying to be passed, anti-terrorism legislation.
[01:28:48.304 --> 01:28:49.324]  You cover that in the film.
[01:28:50.064 --> 01:28:52.766]  And all that was stalled after the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:28:52.846 --> 01:29:00.612]  If you mentioned anything about, you know, restoring the Constitution or the fighting the expansion of the police state powers, now you're a McVeigh.
[01:29:00.773 --> 01:29:02.033]  It was used to silence everybody.
[01:29:02.054 --> 01:29:05.516]  And we see that as a precursor to 9-11 and the Patriot Act.
[01:29:05.536 --> 01:29:08.258]  This is a methodology that they use over and over again.
[01:29:08.278 --> 01:29:15.384]  And Oklahoma City, I think, is one of the best cases that we can use to expose their methodology because there's so many holes in the case.
[01:29:15.444 --> 01:29:16.785]  It's so easy to tear it apart.
[01:29:17.245 --> 01:29:21.928]  What we tried to do with this is boil it down to just the most provable essence.
[01:29:22.388 --> 01:29:23.489]  All right, stay there, stay there.
[01:29:23.509 --> 01:29:25.930]  We're going to come back with the most provable essence.
[01:29:26.231 --> 01:29:27.792]  That was James Lane speaking.
[01:29:28.152 --> 01:29:29.673]  Chris Emery, the producer with him.
[01:29:30.093 --> 01:29:35.516]  By the way, they got a great video connection with us there in their studio of your prisonplanet.tv viewer.
[01:29:35.556 --> 01:29:41.020]  But for the radio listeners, we'll also post this obviously by this evening on the public YouTube channel.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:46.003]  But it's so important to expose a noble lie, a globalist gambit.
[01:29:47.023 --> 01:29:50.668]  Against Liberty to stop the Patriot counter coup against their takeover.
[01:29:50.909 --> 01:29:57.518]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:30:02.503 --> 01:30:16.979]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.664]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:30:22.662 --> 01:30:34.674]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:35.434 --> 01:30:42.701]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:30:43.382 --> 01:30:52.970]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:31:01.477 --> 01:31:02.697]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:31:47.455 --> 01:31:50.797]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:50.817 --> 01:31:54.099]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:54.159 --> 01:31:55.960]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:17.694 --> 01:32:20.436]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:22.357 --> 01:32:24.518]  They sow pride in every stitch.

[01:32:40.498 --> 01:32:42.379]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:42.639 --> 01:32:44.159]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.001]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:47.321 --> 01:32:51.362]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[01:32:56.644 --> 01:32:58.065]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:58.225 --> 01:32:58.685]  Got it.
[01:32:59.005 --> 01:32:59.866]  Others don't.
[01:33:11.178 --> 01:33:13.820]  A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, 1995.
[01:33:14.781 --> 01:33:17.263]  Without truth, there is no justice.
[01:33:18.744 --> 01:33:21.706]  VZ Lawton, Oklahoma City, bombing survivor.
[01:33:22.607 --> 01:33:26.991]  And the film is just jam-packed with survivors and eyewitnesses.
[01:33:27.651 --> 01:33:33.536]  It is, it really is the antidote to the lie.
[01:33:34.972 --> 01:33:45.578]  And if you order it by Sunday, we can guarantee that it'll be shipped out to you before Christmas so you can give it as a gift or buy a couple copies, one for yourself and one to give friends and family.
[01:33:45.618 --> 01:33:49.460]  It is so important to support alternative media and filmmaking.
[01:33:50.786 --> 01:34:06.561]  With all of this internet censorship coming in and the open announcements that they want to start shutting off the alternative media because we're becoming the dominant media, it is more important than ever that we go with the old-fashioned DVD and VHS and things like that to continue to get this information out to people.
[01:34:06.581 --> 01:34:13.468]  Because as the system starts to try to clamp down on free speech, people are going to recognize it more.
[01:34:14.657 --> 01:34:17.778]  And the system's doing this because they're being exposed.
[01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:21.800]  The system is going in this direction because they're going to get in a lot of trouble if they don't.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.661]  I mean, Corzine has been caught stealing millions of dollars.
[01:34:25.321 --> 01:34:29.703]  He's one of the top White House advisors, former governor of New Jersey, former head of Goldman Sachs.
[01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:33.344]  And the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:39.026]  His own people at the CME Group are saying, no, he knew about it and gave the order.
[01:34:39.066 --> 01:34:40.027]  I'm not going to lie for him.
[01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:43.892]  And the media is trying to act like that news didn't come out three days ago.
[01:34:43.992 --> 01:34:44.673]  This is huge!
[01:34:47.597 --> 01:34:48.819]  Just like Fast and Furious!
[01:34:49.909 --> 01:34:52.991]  First, he said he didn't know about it, then it turned out he was intimately involved in it.
[01:34:53.272 --> 01:34:55.353]  Now the media says, oh, he put a stop to it, though.
[01:34:55.914 --> 01:35:03.960]  The government shipping guns into Mexico to destabilize Mexico, but to also then blame the Second Amendment, and CBS News got those memos.
[01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:07.303]  A pure example of a false flag staged event.
[01:35:07.883 --> 01:35:15.930]  Now, I want to get into the film, I want to get into the crystallized key points that prove the official story is a fraud, and that there was a government cover-up and government involvement.
[01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:16.991]  Elements of government.
[01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:24.077]  But I also want to parallel it to today with the Attorney General, who was the Deputy Attorney General.
[01:35:24.117 --> 01:35:29.122]  We have his emails, thanks to lawsuits and FOIA requests, where he was saying, we've got to cover this up.
[01:35:29.202 --> 01:35:30.463]  It's a D-Day operation.
[01:35:31.124 --> 01:35:34.507]  We've got to get in there and make sure the public doesn't find out what happened.
[01:35:35.598 --> 01:35:36.038]  And they did!
[01:35:36.058 --> 01:35:38.859]  I mean, you know, people like Terrence Yeakey went bye-bye.
[01:35:39.519 --> 01:35:50.643]  So again, joining us from Oklahoma are Chris Emery and James Lane, the director, of course, James Lane, and the producer, Chris Emery, who've really made a first-class, only modern film.
[01:35:51.403 --> 01:35:56.466]  There were some underground things that came out right after it happened that did a great job exposing, you know, the bombs in the building and the newscast.
[01:35:56.706 --> 01:35:59.288]  But it was always grainy, you know, 10th generation.
[01:35:59.548 --> 01:36:00.949]  They got the original footage.
[01:36:00.969 --> 01:36:02.349]  They got stuff I've never seen before.
[01:36:02.710 --> 01:36:04.671]  I mean, folks, it's not high point, I tell you.
[01:36:04.711 --> 01:36:12.035]  A Noble Lie is a film you want to get, you want to have viewing parties, you want to give it to police, military, now!
[01:36:12.555 --> 01:36:16.458]  So that when the globalists stage this stuff, to blame returning veterans and others.
[01:36:16.858 --> 01:36:18.639]  Because that's what they've built their force up for.
[01:36:19.861 --> 01:36:21.803]  People know what they're dealing with.
[01:36:21.843 --> 01:36:41.397]  And just like you were mentioning, James, the fact that with the... Because the gentleman on the plane, Kurt Haskell, saw the underwear bomber being got on the plane and things, he made mental note, and his information turned out to be true, and the government had to admit they got the underwear bomber on the plane.
[01:36:41.718 --> 01:36:45.601]  And so now our people, people who are awake to false flag, we're everywhere!
[01:36:45.881 --> 01:36:47.722]  And that's really shaking the system up.
[01:36:47.782 --> 01:36:48.443]  Please continue.
[01:36:49.485 --> 01:37:02.888]  Yes, and that's why it's important for your viewers and listeners to go to the Infowars store and pick up this documentary because it's going to show, again, the methodology that's been used to cover up these events and again, steer us towards globalization.
[01:37:03.688 --> 01:37:07.089]  One thing that came out recently, you had Andrew Griffin on from Reddit Report.
[01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:13.271]  He was exposing that there's some internal documents that came out from Fusion Center
[01:37:13.951 --> 01:37:14.131]  I think?
[01:37:36.933 --> 01:37:42.296]  Because these institutions' primary goal above all else, above truth and justice, is self-preservation.
[01:37:42.716 --> 01:37:43.076]  You know?
[01:37:43.256 --> 01:37:47.679]  And, I mean, this is a state representative that just was trying to get to, you know, uncover the truth.
[01:37:47.739 --> 01:37:51.080]  And by the way, the federal document that we showed on air, we can pull it up.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.421]  State fusion document.
[01:37:52.781 --> 01:37:56.083]  Homeland Security document says OKC investigators are terrorists.
[01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:57.424]  We can put the actual document up.
[01:37:57.764 --> 01:38:01.166]  That'll pull it up if you want to search it, viewers or listeners, or my own team.
[01:38:01.986 --> 01:38:07.609]  You notice, they give a brief description and they say, this group doesn't believe the official story.
[01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:08.590]  They're terrorists.
[01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:10.991]  And of course, it's just a derelict website.
[01:38:11.351 --> 01:38:19.216]  He put the report out almost a decade ago, run by state rep Charles Key, very upstanding with grand jurors and others that were there and knew what happened.
[01:38:19.636 --> 01:38:21.977]  General Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[01:38:22.318 --> 01:38:26.940]  And so here they are telling cops, you investigate this and say it might not be what you were told.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.061]  You're a terrorist.
[01:38:28.301 --> 01:38:29.742]  It's like people three weeks ago said,
[01:38:30.262 --> 01:38:31.223]  This can't be true!
[01:38:31.243 --> 01:38:35.267]  The government's gonna secretly arrest citizens and now it's admitted.
[01:38:35.507 --> 01:38:37.289]  But guys, break it down.
[01:38:37.329 --> 01:38:38.030]  You've got the floor.
[01:38:39.875 --> 01:38:44.398]  Well, I think we should elaborate on the press, Alex, and what you brought up.
[01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:50.162]  Melissa Klinzing was the news director for Channel 4, KFOR, in Oklahoma City the morning of the bombing.
[01:38:50.482 --> 01:38:59.468]  And up to a year following the case, she said, and one of her famous quotes was, there's not one person in Oklahoma City that believes that Timothy McVeigh blew up the E.P.
[01:38:59.528 --> 01:39:00.569]  Murrah building by himself.
[01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:03.731]  The New York Times swept in, bought out Channel 4.
[01:39:04.531 --> 01:39:11.956]  They did not renew the contract for the news director and one of the top, I think one of the top beat reporters, Jayna Davis, that actually investigated this case.
[01:39:12.477 --> 01:39:18.040]  That is a clear sign that the media does control the stories in the way they want to.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.962]  They will literally go out and buy out a station or a newspaper.
[01:39:21.482 --> 01:39:25.985]  So, if your listeners are in any doubt that that happens, it continues to happen.
[01:39:26.025 --> 01:39:27.927]  We've seen it firsthand right here in Oklahoma City.
[01:39:28.627 --> 01:39:32.469]  The blast pattern of the building clearly shows that there was contact charges.
[01:39:32.929 --> 01:39:43.015]  There are sources that came forward that we're going to elaborate on, that some were not included in the movie, that heard both the FBI and other law enforcement officers say,
[01:39:43.715 --> 01:39:50.520]  There were swabs, there were actually samples that were taken off of the columns that clearly show that there was C4 that dismantled those columns.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:59.526]  Yeah, we've got Brigadier General Partin interviewed in the documentary and he did an excellent analysis saying that there had to be additional ordnance inside the building.
[01:39:59.546 --> 01:40:01.187]  He actually showed where they would have to be placed.
[01:40:01.647 --> 01:40:02.888]  He came and warned people at the time.
[01:40:02.908 --> 01:40:09.356]  When he saw it in the news, he saw the blast points on columns further away from columns that weren't damaged right up by the truck.
[01:40:09.697 --> 01:40:16.685]  You have the seismographs, the reports, the recordings, the ATF showing up seconds after, police being suspicious about it.
[01:40:17.005 --> 01:40:18.787]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:40:19.648 --> 01:40:20.088]  Exactly.
[01:40:20.168 --> 01:40:23.371]  And we've got witnesses, actual survivors from the building.
[01:40:23.391 --> 01:40:27.333]  I mean, who are you going to believe, the FEMA report or the actual survivors that were in the building?
[01:40:27.674 --> 01:40:31.876]  They said that the building was coming down 8 to 10 seconds before the truck bomb went off.
[01:40:32.136 --> 01:40:35.299]  I mean, to the point where the building was shaken and they thought it was an earthquake.
[01:40:35.739 --> 01:40:39.361]  And they had enough time to get under their desk, you know, before the glass blew in.
[01:40:39.381 --> 01:40:41.423]  Shane Graham heading up HUD, as you know.
[01:40:41.443 --> 01:40:42.063]  We've interviewed her.
[01:40:42.083 --> 01:40:42.804]  She's in your film.
[01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:50.987]  Jane Graham saw them the day before wiring the building, a bunch of feds, and thought it was telephone men.
[01:40:51.007 --> 01:40:53.008]  I mean, they were just all over the place doing it.
[01:40:53.608 --> 01:41:03.893]  Yeah, and if the FEMA report says that that blast wave was traveling at 1,300 feet per second, you explain to me how that glass blows in, you know, and they've got eight to ten seconds before that to actually get under their desks.
[01:41:03.933 --> 01:41:04.733]  It's just nonsense.
[01:41:04.773 --> 01:41:16.359]  We've got a quote from Dr. Samuel Cohen, the inventor of the neutron bomb, saying that it doesn't matter how much ammonium nitrate and fuel oil was used, it would be against the laws of physics for it to create the blast pattern that it did.
[01:41:16.759 --> 01:41:18.980]  We've got an Eglin Air Force Base report.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.141]  The Air Force reconstructed the event.
[01:41:21.421 --> 01:41:26.944]  They used the barrels and they said that the gap between the barrels actually cancelled out most of the blast and pushed it upwards.
[01:41:27.284 --> 01:41:30.885]  They created one single larger bomb, set it off next to a weaker structure,
[01:41:32.466 --> 01:41:33.507]  And it did less damage.
[01:41:33.547 --> 01:41:37.829]  It was the final analysis from that report that there had to be additional ordnance inside the building.
[01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:43.393]  And by the way, the ATF, when was it they blew up their own Ryder truck to their own test right before?
[01:41:44.173 --> 01:41:47.195]  It was in the months before in the deserts of New Mexico, that's correct.
[01:41:47.275 --> 01:41:48.036]  Almost identical.
[01:41:48.056 --> 01:41:52.939]  I mean, these people are... And of course, Terrence Yakey, the police officer, knew that, but we know what happened to him.
[01:41:54.454 --> 01:41:55.515]  That was very unfortunate.
[01:41:55.535 --> 01:42:02.420]  A year and three weeks after the bombing, he was found brutally murdered about a mile and a half from the front gate of the El Reno Penitentiary.
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.982]  That's 32 miles west of downtown Oklahoma City.
[01:42:05.582 --> 01:42:18.312]  He walked nearly a mile from his vehicle and just multiple deep lacerations to the arms and the neck, rope burns on the neck, handcuffs, scars on the wrists, and they said that he shot himself next to a tree.
[01:42:18.552 --> 01:42:19.473]  Completely ludicrous.
[01:42:19.693 --> 01:42:20.774]  No investigation done.
[01:42:20.794 --> 01:42:28.521]  Just like Vince Foster, of course, what his last call was to his partner, though, that he'd gone to his storage shed to get, you know, the proof and that feds were following him.
[01:42:29.022 --> 01:42:29.582]  That's correct.
[01:42:29.962 --> 01:42:37.970]  It was actually, the death blow was a wound that came down from the top of his head through the bottom of his jaw at a distance far enough away not to leave powder burns.
[01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:40.512]  You know, and then his death is called a suicide.
[01:42:40.532 --> 01:42:41.713]  They don't do an autopsy.
[01:42:42.093 --> 01:42:45.617]  You know, and his family said that he wasn't suicidal.
[01:42:45.877 --> 01:42:46.938]  He was getting promotions.
[01:42:46.958 --> 01:42:48.079]  He was getting the key to the city.
[01:42:48.099 --> 01:42:49.400]  He had reconciled with his wife.
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.561]  He had everything to live for.
[01:42:50.881 --> 01:42:55.465]  And when they questioned that it was called a suicide, they said, well, you guys are paranoid.
[01:42:55.485 --> 01:42:56.867]  You watch too much television.
[01:42:57.742 --> 01:43:09.069]  One thing that we found out from the county sheriffs in Canadian County, which is next to Oklahoma County, where Oklahoma City is, that these are people that Terrence went to kindergarten with, he went to high school with, they were sheriffs, deputies.
[01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:17.635]  They showed up at the scene where Terry's body was found, and they said that there were law enforcement personnel, both plainclothes and uniformed, turning over the crime scene with spade shovels.
[01:43:18.015 --> 01:43:22.018]  Completely in the face of any tangible or any credible investigation.
[01:43:22.058 --> 01:43:23.018]  They did not do an autopsy.
[01:43:23.038 --> 01:43:25.520]  They were literally mopping up the torture and murder scene.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:26.520]  It was horrible.
[01:43:26.661 --> 01:43:28.201]  It was absolutely horrible what they did.
[01:43:28.301 --> 01:43:32.764]  Well, this was used to silence anybody else that was going to investigate this, you know.
[01:43:32.784 --> 01:43:36.986]  And by the way, see, those sheriffs right then should have just arrested those feds.
[01:43:37.246 --> 01:43:39.267]  I mean, clearly, you're covering this up.
[01:43:39.467 --> 01:43:40.168]  You were involved.
[01:43:40.588 --> 01:43:41.969]  But see, not in America now.
[01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.929]  Oh, you're a fed.
[01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.710]  Oh, let me grovel to you.
[01:43:44.890 --> 01:43:47.612]  But again, dovetailing this, look at Fast and Furious.
[01:43:48.312 --> 01:43:48.773]  Look at how...
[01:43:49.854 --> 01:43:52.865]  They were shipping the guns into Mexico, drugs back in.
[01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:55.455]  It's even in the New York Times now, but nobody's in trouble.
[01:43:56.264 --> 01:44:03.070]  ABC just came out with internal emails saying that they were going to use this event to issue new gun control legislation.
[01:44:03.090 --> 01:44:04.691]  I mean, it's just out in the open now.
[01:44:05.692 --> 01:44:12.437]  Something else that was interesting about Teriyaki is one of the hallmarks of an ammonium nitrate and fuel oil bomb is a nitric gas cloud.
[01:44:12.757 --> 01:44:19.002]  Anytime that it was used in Ireland, 41 years ago last August, in Stirling Hall, they set off an amphibomb.
[01:44:19.022 --> 01:44:22.405]  The first 26 responders were hospitalized from inhalation of nitric gas.
[01:44:22.785 --> 01:44:25.506]  That did not occur at the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:44:26.066 --> 01:44:29.508]  Teriyaki was on the scene within minutes and saved eight people's lives that day.
[01:44:29.888 --> 01:44:35.490]  All of the survivors said that they had no problem with respiration other than a little bit of the smoke from the cars that were out front.
[01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:40.012]  So there was no ammonium nitrate gas, which calls into question that ampho was even used at all.
[01:44:40.572 --> 01:44:45.373]  No, they did that to then start tracking farmers and teach that, you know, the American people are terrorists.
[01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:48.233]  Now again, why were they so scared of Terence Yeagy?
[01:44:48.273 --> 01:44:50.014]  I mean, you interview his mother in this film.
[01:44:50.054 --> 01:44:52.354]  I believe that's the first time she's been interviewed in a film.
[01:44:52.414 --> 01:44:53.674]  I mean, folks, I can't tell you.
[01:44:53.714 --> 01:44:58.555]  This is a true investigative masterwork and it's cyanide to these vampires.
[01:44:58.915 --> 01:45:06.117]  This is a big old bucket of holy water, a big old silver cross to Count Dracula, but you've got to get it and you've got to use it against them.
[01:45:07.397 --> 01:45:08.097]  I'll just ask you on air.
[01:45:08.877 --> 01:45:11.098]  What's your stance on folks airing this on AXS TV?
[01:45:11.818 --> 01:45:12.599]  Oh, we encourage it.
[01:45:13.059 --> 01:45:18.561]  If anybody wants to set up a local screening, they can get in contact with us at contact at freemindfilms.com.
[01:45:18.581 --> 01:45:20.822]  We'll send them movie posters that they can use to promote it.
[01:45:21.242 --> 01:45:22.843]  Other people are talking about putting it in the libraries.
[01:45:22.863 --> 01:45:25.904]  They can go to Infowars store, buy it there, put it in the libraries.
[01:45:26.304 --> 01:45:27.265]  You know, get the word out.
[01:45:27.768 --> 01:45:34.275]  We've had, in fact, a member of the Obama committee, very active in a local parish here in Oklahoma City, wants to do a showing at his church.
[01:45:34.695 --> 01:45:35.356]  We encourage that.
[01:45:35.396 --> 01:45:37.718]  I'm looking forward to meeting the pastor, so the word be with you.
[01:45:37.738 --> 01:45:46.828]  Well, Americans couldn't believe the government was this evil 15, 16 years ago, but doesn't Fast and Furious and Tonkin being declassified and all this stuff being out now and
[01:45:47.028 --> 01:45:49.329]  That us evil 9-11 truthers question things.
[01:45:49.989 --> 01:45:53.051]  We've broken the ice, so people now understand this.
[01:45:53.311 --> 01:45:56.293]  But why do you think all these White House advisors are so arrogant?
[01:45:56.533 --> 01:45:58.834]  It's like five of them now are pleading.
[01:45:59.254 --> 01:46:01.035]  If we just had one, it would really help you.
[01:46:01.055 --> 01:46:06.117]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are to be writing articles saying, we'll blame our enemies, we really need one.
[01:46:06.137 --> 01:46:09.279]  And obviously the higher-ups are going, no, they're onto us, we can't do it.
[01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:23.005]  They're intoxicated with arrogance, Alex, and after you know all the intel on this, most of it, and what we've seen, you're right, it's absolutely unbelievable that they can get up in the morning and look at themselves in the mirror and think that they can actually get away with this.
[01:46:23.345 --> 01:46:26.429]  They have no value for human life, and we saw it first hand here.
[01:46:26.749 --> 01:46:32.013]  When you look at all of the criteria of a psychopath, these people actually meet all of the criteria.
[01:46:32.353 --> 01:46:40.238]  They believe that we are actually lesser beings than they are and they have no remorse for riding our ashes to their own political ends.
[01:46:40.338 --> 01:46:44.802]  Now the head of the FBI's counter-terrorism group claimed he was in Dallas and got a Southwest flight.
[01:46:44.842 --> 01:46:46.002]  Turned out he didn't fly.
[01:46:46.022 --> 01:46:47.664]  They have the hotel receipts.
[01:46:47.704 --> 01:46:48.464]  He's that arrogant.
[01:46:48.704 --> 01:46:50.566]  We know some of the teams that were already there.
[01:46:51.186 --> 01:46:54.828]  And so from your deep research, as you guys are nose to the grindstone on this,
[01:46:55.709 --> 01:47:01.397]  Go through some more of the points, but also as best we can tell exactly who was involved in this.
[01:47:01.657 --> 01:47:10.869]  From my research, it's FBI, high-level government special forces, some private think tanks, some foreign intelligence operatives, and FBI.
[01:47:11.770 --> 01:47:17.453]  Well, we have a, here in Oklahoma, in Eastern Oklahoma, we have a white separatist compound called Elohim City.
[01:47:17.913 --> 01:47:21.735]  Now, this seemed to be a base of operations for the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:47:22.255 --> 01:47:32.499]  You had FBI informant Carol Howe, I'm sorry, ATF informant Carol Howe, was telling the ATF prior to the Oklahoma City bombing that these people were scouting out locations to attack federal buildings.
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.260]  Now, there was foreknowledge there.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.203]  We've got a witness, an actual resident of Elohim City, that says that he can place Timothy McVeigh on site.
[01:47:40.923 --> 01:47:45.147]  So they were using it as a cut-out and the Southern Poverty Law Center had operatives in there, correct?
[01:47:45.687 --> 01:47:54.134]  Exactly, and that's some of the documents that Jesse Trinidou has uncovered, is that there were at least six Southern Poverty Law Center operatives at Elohim City at the time.
[01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:59.438]  And, you know, he said anytime you got five people talking about overthrowing the government, three of them are working for the government.
[01:47:59.698 --> 01:48:09.026]  And it looks like they're using the Southern Poverty Law Center as a private wing of the FBI and ATF to be able to do operations that, you know, they wouldn't normally be able to do
[01:48:09.326 --> 01:48:11.307]  Because of the restrictions of the institutions.
[01:48:31.445 --> 01:48:36.367]  Now why were so many Iraqis brought in that have been brought in after the first Gulf War by Bush Sr.
[01:48:36.527 --> 01:48:37.467]  and Clinton?
[01:48:37.768 --> 01:48:46.091]  Was that a cover story or an emergency plan B to blame it on Arabs and Muslims if the domestic terror route didn't go well?
[01:48:47.082 --> 01:48:48.603]  You know, that's a red herring, Alex.
[01:48:48.643 --> 01:48:51.524]  I wish we could put a better thumb on that, but you're right.
[01:48:51.544 --> 01:48:57.807]  There were over 5,000 refugees that were located to the Midwest and the Oklahoma City area in Oklahoma.
[01:48:58.308 --> 01:49:07.692]  A lot of the folks that were suspect on this case, we know that some of them still live here in the city, and it's very, very disgusting to see that they weren't brought into custody.
[01:49:08.092 --> 01:49:13.295]  We know that some of them were complicit, but we just couldn't include that in the film because we didn't have enough definitive information.
[01:49:13.835 --> 01:49:22.265]  Another thing that concerns me about that is former CIA Director Woosley is actually now publicly saying, yes, you know, he thinks that there was Al-Qaeda involvement.
[01:49:22.465 --> 01:49:28.091]  It looks like they're trying to use this to support the, you know... Well, I've always said they were going to double back because...
[01:49:28.712 --> 01:49:32.034]  Those guys were trained by the CIA when Saddam was, quote, the U.S.
[01:49:32.134 --> 01:49:32.435]  ally.
[01:49:32.855 --> 01:49:34.556]  And so that's why they were brought back out.
[01:49:34.876 --> 01:49:38.399]  Most of them were double agents who were helping give intel on Saddam.
[01:49:38.699 --> 01:49:40.860]  So they were brought back out at the end of the last Gulf War.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:45.783]  And so we know some of them were videotaped, were involved, and then were allowed to leave the country.
[01:49:46.324 --> 01:49:50.347]  So again, this is a classic intel op where they've got layer after layer.
[01:49:51.227 --> 01:49:54.750]  So that no one knows the full story, but the mastermind.
[01:49:55.570 --> 01:49:57.112]  I wonder what Mr. Holter can tell us.
[01:49:57.792 --> 01:49:58.433]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:58.493 --> 01:50:00.074]  That's why we need to hold these people accountable.
[01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:01.615]  They're still in positions of power today.
[01:50:02.055 --> 01:50:11.162]  You know, we see that McVeigh was actually telling his family and everybody that he was actually working for the government to fly drugs into the United States and assassinate security risks.
[01:50:11.863 --> 01:50:19.208]  Even, you know, Terry Nichols, after he had gone through his federal and state trials, was saying that, you know, he was ready to spill the beans about the other people that were involved.
[01:50:20.489 --> 01:50:26.775]  Well, if McVeigh was involved with all these other people and he was about to be put to death, why does he not, you know, turn them out and tell them what happened?
[01:50:27.255 --> 01:50:35.883]  Well, I think that, you know, the presence of Dr. Jolion West, he consulted with McVeigh's defense team after his arrest.
[01:50:36.203 --> 01:50:41.227]  He was the number two psychological warfare expert in the country just under Dr. Ewing Cameron.
[01:50:41.688 --> 01:50:44.210]  He worked with Patty Hearst, Saron Saron, and Jack Ruby.
[01:50:44.530 --> 01:50:46.852]  Now, after that... Stay there, you can't move!
[01:50:47.092 --> 01:50:51.540]  He was the assigned doctor for him from the arrest up to the execution.
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:54.906]  Every time McVeigh was on TV, he was drugged out of his gourd.
[01:50:55.467 --> 01:50:56.249]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:56.269 --> 01:50:56.769]  Stay with us.
[01:51:02.245 --> 01:51:05.446]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:51:05.786 --> 01:51:11.187]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:51:11.807 --> 01:51:12.107]  Why?

[01:53:53.779 --> 01:53:57.587]  Visit iTunesBomb.com and let's end these wars.
[01:54:10.541 --> 01:54:15.443]  Folks, I cannot express to you enough that exposing false black terror is the key
[01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:39.231]  At this temporal level of existence, to bringin' down these people, because everything they do is stage a crisis, offer a solution.
[01:54:40.271 --> 01:54:44.172]  They stage a global financial crisis, take over society as a solution.
[01:54:44.572 --> 01:54:44.992]  On record.
[01:54:45.032 --> 01:54:45.813]  They don't even deny that.
[01:54:46.273 --> 01:54:53.174]  They stage, uh, oh my gosh, carbon dioxide's deadly, the Earth's gonna die, we gotta tax and control everything.
[01:54:55.054 --> 01:54:55.755]  To save the Earth.
[01:54:55.875 --> 01:54:58.955]  Oh my gosh, we gotta take all your rights and invade and attack all these countries.
[01:55:00.516 --> 01:55:02.496]  Because you're in danger and they're gonna blow stuff up.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:05.221]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[01:55:05.341 --> 01:55:06.721]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:55:07.622 --> 01:55:09.743]  And again, I'm not gonna push this much more.
[01:55:09.803 --> 01:55:13.305]  I just hope that you give the gift of truth this Christmas, whether it's all...
[01:55:14.771 --> 01:55:19.132]  18 of my films on DVD are 70% off and 18 different gifts.
[01:55:19.152 --> 01:55:20.292]  You can do all your shopping at once.
[01:55:20.672 --> 01:55:22.073]  A Noble Lie Oklahoma City 95.
[01:55:22.293 --> 01:55:27.574]  You get Citizen Rulebook with it and InfoWars.com and in the Fed bumper stickers as well.
[01:55:28.114 --> 01:55:40.837]  That's available at InfoWars.com and I mean it's a life-and-death situation to expose that, hey, criminal elements in the government engaged in this military gambit.
[01:55:41.037 --> 01:55:41.677]  That's what it's called.
[01:55:41.717 --> 01:55:42.438]  It's really a gambit.
[01:55:42.458 --> 01:55:44.058]  In fact, I'll guarantee you that's what they called it.
[01:55:45.293 --> 01:55:50.135]  To demonize domestic groups and move towards using the military against the population.
[01:55:50.455 --> 01:55:55.256]  That's when all that current plan went into high gear that I became aware of at Oklahoma City.
[01:55:55.276 --> 01:55:57.157]  That's what really pushed me to get on air.
[01:55:57.217 --> 01:55:57.797]  I saw that.
[01:55:58.137 --> 01:56:02.498]  Saw the local newscast that folks were mailing down to Austin and getting on AXS TV.
[01:56:02.558 --> 01:56:11.981]  I was seeing like a week after it was on the news of the bombs being taken out and the governor talking about it and press conferences with Hoppy Heidelberg or General Benton K. Parton.
[01:56:12.381 --> 01:56:14.282]  I was watching what Oklahomans were seeing.
[01:56:15.863 --> 01:56:17.885]  Because there were folks sending it down here in a network.
[01:56:17.985 --> 01:56:20.428]  I was sitting on AXS TV and I said, oh my gosh.
[01:56:21.909 --> 01:56:25.232]  I'd already read in history books about Hitler blowing up the Reichstag and stuff.
[01:56:25.292 --> 01:56:27.054]  I said, I gotta go get on air.
[01:56:27.074 --> 01:56:29.196]  I'm getting the same chills I got back then.
[01:56:30.307 --> 01:56:32.768]  And I'm, boom, because it's the heart of it.
[01:56:33.208 --> 01:56:34.949]  It's how they sell everything else.
[01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:37.550]  We gotta attack Iran, they're gonna nuke us.
[01:56:37.810 --> 01:56:40.192]  We gotta have checkpoints, because you can't be trusted.
[01:56:40.992 --> 01:56:44.253]  And it's prior restraint, it's saying, you're bad, you're a terrorist, you're evil.
[01:56:44.654 --> 01:56:58.040]  Our guest will be with us for another 20 minutes, but I'll tell you, they're so informed, and they've got such a great audio and video set up, I want to invite them back up next week to do part two, because, and you know, to really have it prepared, they can send me clips they want to play,
[01:56:59.119 --> 01:57:01.341]  And we can kind of go through the film and do a full review.
[01:57:01.361 --> 01:57:04.244]  We'll also try to do it on the nightly news, but this is so important.
[01:57:05.004 --> 01:57:15.714]  Going back to both of these gentlemen, we're about to go to break here, but we're going to come back in the next 20 minutes and I'm going to turn the mic off and literally go sit in the control room so you guys can get your points out.
[01:57:15.734 --> 01:57:19.578]  But when we come back, what is most important in smoking guns?
[01:57:20.038 --> 01:57:21.299]  Were you guys threatened?
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:24.122]  What else was important for folks to know about the film?
[01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:30.246]  The way the grand jury was given the information, they were very restricted in what they could see.
[01:57:30.806 --> 01:57:36.488]  And Judge David Russell, oddly enough, who presided over the grand jury, was selected.
[01:57:36.528 --> 01:57:41.310]  He was on the short list of judges who actually selected the defense counsel.
[01:57:41.630 --> 01:57:43.692]  He ended up selecting McVeigh's own counsel.
[01:57:43.992 --> 01:57:47.295]  So this thing was rigged from day one, even on the judicial side.
[01:57:47.875 --> 01:57:51.518]  Hopya Heidelberg comes forward in the movie and pretty much tells it all out.
[01:57:51.558 --> 01:57:56.363]  He lays it out, how he was treated, the fact that he wasn't able to get shop drawings, he wasn't able to call the witnesses.
[01:57:57.003 --> 01:58:05.409]  It wasn't able to call the architects, get any samples of the crime scene evidence, and he was given three choices on the situation.
[01:58:05.969 --> 01:58:15.916]  The judge pretty much could have dismissed him without cause, he could have granted Hoppe's wishes on this letter that he wrote to the judge, or he could have said no, and then given reasons why he declined to give Hoppe the information.
[01:58:16.476 --> 01:58:20.239]  The judge took the first option of dismissing him from the grand jury without cause.
[01:58:20.819 --> 01:58:21.540]  Unbelievable!
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:25.522]  This is the only guy on the 12-member jury that was asking questions that were relevant to the crime.
[01:58:25.703 --> 01:58:29.185]  And the FBI came to his house with their firearms, threatening him.
[01:58:30.005 --> 01:58:30.446]  Exactly.
[01:58:30.466 --> 01:58:36.149]  He was the only one that had actually read the juror's handbook and he knew what his rights were as a federal grand juror and demanded those.
[01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:37.590]  They weren't going to allow that.
[01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:38.351]  Stay there.
[01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:39.191]  Back in one minute.

[01:58:55.689 --> 01:58:56.610]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.950 --> 01:59:00.533]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.813 --> 01:59:03.095]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:03.275 --> 01:59:08.579]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.979 --> 01:59:15.224]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:15.644 --> 01:59:21.188]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:21.628 --> 01:59:25.290]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.811 --> 01:59:29.813]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:30.093 --> 01:59:35.597]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:36.037 --> 01:59:38.999]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:39.599 --> 01:59:41.020]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:42.001]  It's here.

[02:00:11.134 --> 02:00:11.934]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.714 --> 02:00:13.655]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.255 --> 02:00:17.897]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.458 --> 02:00:22.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.188 --> 02:00:25.850]  We're into the third hour and 20 minutes.
[02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:27.191]  Bob Chapman's joining us.
[02:00:27.211 --> 02:00:36.801]  We're doing part one of this interview live right now with our guest, the producer and the director of the film, A Noble Lie, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:36.821 --> 02:00:40.004]  We were just talking about Hoppy Heidelberg with his Citizen's Rulebook.
[02:00:41.417 --> 02:00:50.321]  He actually had one of these, same ones we sell, the Patriot one about jury nullification, all of it, the rights of a grand juror, and they got pretty upset about that.
[02:00:50.361 --> 02:00:59.305]  I talked to him years ago, from memory, I think he tried to hand these out, too, and that really made him upset, and they just wanted the cover-up to go ahead, but he's in the film.
[02:00:59.925 --> 02:01:06.748]  Continue, gentlemen, this is a five-minute segment, we've got a 12-minute segment coming up before you leave us, but continue breaking down a noble lie in the Hoppe-Heidelberg point.
[02:01:07.268 --> 02:01:13.693]  Well, you were talking about intimidation, and yes, Hoppy was intimidated by the FBI, or, well, they attempted to intimidate him.
[02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:15.255]  He wasn't going to have any of that.
[02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:17.656]  But we also interview Don Browning.
[02:01:17.716 --> 02:01:21.880]  He's a retired Oklahoma City police officer that worked at the K-9 unit and was there for search and rescue.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.864]  He said that an FBI agent said that people like him that ask questions often end up dead.
[02:01:27.244 --> 02:01:30.106]  And he said that it was the way it was presented to him, he thought it was a threat.
[02:01:30.687 --> 02:01:31.908]  Oh, of course!
[02:01:31.968 --> 02:01:34.350]  Yeah, I mean, wow, they had their hit men everywhere.
[02:01:34.690 --> 02:01:35.131]  Go ahead.
[02:01:35.671 --> 02:01:40.456]  And a lot of the people that we interview in the movie, they've stated that this is going to be the last interview they do.
[02:01:40.897 --> 02:01:47.224]  So, I mean, this is really the last chance that we, you know, to really encapsulate this story into one cohesive package.
[02:01:47.824 --> 02:01:51.328]  You know, we've got folks like, you know, Jane Graham where she said, you know, this is it.
[02:01:51.368 --> 02:01:52.389]  She's not going to do another one.
[02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.510]  Exactly.
[02:01:53.991 --> 02:02:09.764]  One other thing that people will appreciate this film even more is that the gentleman that actually shot, he was our director of photography, shot the interviews, had done the same thing on several anniversaries the last four or five years for Discovery Channel, for History Channel, for National Geographic.
[02:02:10.144 --> 02:02:13.187]  He knew firsthand what they, as they say, left on the cutting room floor.
[02:02:13.807 --> 02:02:16.430]  And when we approached him, he says, I want to do it right for you guys.
[02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:19.133]  He says, nothing is going to go on the cutting room floor if I can help it.
[02:02:19.554 --> 02:02:22.937]  By gosh, if our editor kept at least 95% of the interviews on there.
[02:02:23.258 --> 02:02:29.585]  So people are going to see what Discovery, what National Geographic, and what History Channel refused to put on the networks.
[02:02:29.745 --> 02:02:30.446]  We are going to show it.
[02:02:30.746 --> 02:02:38.092]  Yeah, that was our Director of Photography, Devin Winter, and he said that those interview subjects said the same thing to them that they said to us.
[02:02:38.392 --> 02:02:45.738]  But this is the first time that it's all going to come out because anything that contradicted the official story with these mainstream media outlets obviously got cut.
[02:02:46.687 --> 02:02:54.088]  Yeah, I've talked to Jane Graham and in fact, since a lot of people are riding off of The Sunset, and you gave me, well I already have a lot of their numbers, but we do need to get you guys back on.
[02:02:54.128 --> 02:03:01.070]  I forgot that point next week and start having some of them on here and playing some clips just so the public realizes what we're talking about here.
[02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:02.870]  I mean, actually hear it from them.
[02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:08.951]  They've told all this to the mainstream media and it never ends up getting out there because this isn't mainstream media.
[02:03:09.291 --> 02:03:13.292]  This is lying snake media that has brought our country to this point.
[02:03:14.423 --> 02:03:19.324]  I see some of the hosts that we look back on the archive footage and we know who the hosts are.
[02:03:19.344 --> 02:03:20.905]  Of course, they've aged quite a bit since then.
[02:03:21.265 --> 02:03:22.465]  I see them at basketball games.
[02:03:22.505 --> 02:03:24.206]  I'll see them at a Walmart or a 7-Eleven.
[02:03:24.626 --> 02:03:25.546]  They know who I am.
[02:03:25.726 --> 02:03:26.687]  They know who James is.
[02:03:27.047 --> 02:03:29.367]  We know who they are and they just avoid us like the plague.
[02:03:29.507 --> 02:03:30.968]  They do not even want to talk about this.
[02:03:31.368 --> 02:03:32.349]  I mean, they were told to shut up.
[02:03:32.429 --> 02:03:36.273]  Yeah, in the early hours of the bombing, you know, all of the local news stations were telling the truth.
[02:03:36.613 --> 02:03:41.298]  And then after, you know, federal boots hit the ground, the story started to change.
[02:03:41.639 --> 02:03:47.965]  The only station that really maintained any integrity for, what, a few months was the local station, Channel 4.
[02:03:48.566 --> 02:03:54.552]  But then the New York Times came in and bought them up and fired everybody that was contradicting the official story and basically silenced any dissent.
[02:03:55.575 --> 02:04:06.884]  Because this was about the re-election of Bill Clinton and the rollout of the military and police against the citizens, and now here we are, 15, 16 years later, and they've overthrown Posse Comitatus.
[02:04:07.204 --> 02:04:09.206]  They're saying, we'll arrest you and throw away the key.
[02:04:09.666 --> 02:04:10.467]  Total tyranny.
[02:04:11.008 --> 02:04:12.449]  Drones are now being used.
[02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:14.310]  TSA checkpoints on highways.
[02:04:14.691 --> 02:04:16.672]  Government grabbing small children's genitals.
[02:04:17.112 --> 02:04:18.233]  I mean, who could ever believe it?
[02:04:18.273 --> 02:04:20.936]  But they did it all on the back of state's terror.
[02:04:21.601 --> 02:04:25.666]  Yeah, I mean, look at the anti-terrorism legislation that was stalled before the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:04:26.006 --> 02:04:28.329]  It settled through without any dissent after that.
[02:04:28.409 --> 02:04:29.991]  And, you know, same thing with the Patriot Act.
[02:04:30.512 --> 02:04:33.756]  Any expansion of police state power seemed to follow one of these false flag events.
[02:04:36.195 --> 02:04:47.726]  Wow, well, before the year 2011 ends, we're going to have you guys back up repeatedly, and have Jane Graham and others back on, and some of the others you interviewed, right there in studio with you, so people can really have this on record.
[02:04:48.387 --> 02:04:49.928]  And folks, we haven't even scratched the surface.
[02:04:49.948 --> 02:04:58.837]  When we come back, I want you guys to roll through the evidence in the film, and as best you can research who was behind the attacks, specifically in the federal government.
[02:04:58.857 --> 02:05:00.078]  Stay with us, it's a Noble Lie.
[02:05:02.714 --> 02:05:04.196]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:04.416 --> 02:05:09.443]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:09.723 --> 02:05:11.085]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:11.266 --> 02:05:20.057]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:20.778 --> 02:05:27.881]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:28.321 --> 02:05:35.924]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:36.324 --> 02:05:41.246]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:07:05.999 --> 02:07:08.260]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[02:07:08.941 --> 02:07:14.624]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[02:07:14.944 --> 02:07:15.524]  Here's why.
[02:07:15.664 --> 02:07:23.408]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[02:07:23.888 --> 02:07:27.370]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:33.334]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[02:07:33.814 --> 02:07:34.735]  And here's the best part.
[02:07:35.315 --> 02:07:42.220]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[02:07:42.861 --> 02:07:46.944]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:47.184 --> 02:07:48.905]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:07:49.265 --> 02:07:53.328]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[02:08:03.143 --> 02:08:09.148]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.768 --> 02:08:12.811]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.913 --> 02:08:22.179]  It is the only film in the last decade that's been professionally produced looking at Oklahoma City.
[02:08:23.482 --> 02:08:26.324]  I've got 35 minutes or so of my three-hour road to tyranny.
[02:08:27.164 --> 02:08:36.929]  Covers it well, but not with all the eyewitnesses and all the clear footage and the deep research they've done living in Oklahoma for many years.
[02:08:37.349 --> 02:08:44.233]  In fact, Chris, I'm just going from memory, but haven't you been around for like 10 years investigating this that I've heard of you out there being involved?
[02:08:44.753 --> 02:08:45.934]  Yes Alex, thank you.
[02:08:47.295 --> 02:08:49.957]  I started in 2000 and actually moved here in 2003.
[02:08:51.218 --> 02:08:56.901]  There was no way that I could commute back and forth from Fort Worth and then living in New Mexico for a year logistically was impossible.
[02:08:56.961 --> 02:09:01.024]  So I decided to move here and it was amazing.
[02:09:02.265 --> 02:09:10.411]  I was humbled by having the ability to talk to over 325 victims, family members, survivors, law enforcement, everybody that
[02:09:10.911 --> 02:09:14.493]  You found out one at a time that they knew there was something horribly wrong with this story.
[02:09:15.213 --> 02:09:17.534]  And some of them asked me to keep their names confidential.
[02:09:17.594 --> 02:09:19.995]  Others said, that's fine, you can put my name on there.
[02:09:20.435 --> 02:09:21.456]  They signed release forms.
[02:09:21.936 --> 02:09:26.058]  Well, break down some of the people that gave you intel that didn't want to be on the record.
[02:09:26.138 --> 02:09:28.699]  And then some of the other big bombshells that are on record.
[02:09:29.439 --> 02:09:44.891]  I mean, here you've got the inventor of the neutron bomb saying it's impossible, the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, the head grand juror saying he was threatened, you know, the mother of the cop they killed who saw what the ATF did, you know, the woman, the head of HUD seeing the feds planting bombs and thinking they were telephone men.
[02:09:44.911 --> 02:09:46.753]  I mean, this is hardcore.
[02:09:47.233 --> 02:09:48.514]  And this is a testament.
[02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:51.196]  You think you're safe, folks, when people like this run in the country?
[02:09:51.677 --> 02:09:52.897]  It's a gambit in chess.
[02:09:53.678 --> 02:09:57.643]  And militaries do this, where you send in 100 troops, 1,000, to bring out the enemy.
[02:09:57.903 --> 02:10:00.526]  You know it's going to wipe out the troops, but they're a sacrifice.
[02:10:01.027 --> 02:10:03.090]  And the argument is, the end justifies the means.
[02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:05.352]  You don't lose 10,000 troops because you're willing to lose 100.
[02:10:06.273 --> 02:10:10.899]  That's what they do when governments conduct false flags, and it's very sick.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:12.441]  Please continue.
[02:10:12.481 --> 02:10:12.962]  Break it down.
[02:10:13.621 --> 02:10:15.023]  Two people in particular.
[02:10:15.063 --> 02:10:16.024]  In fact, they're in the film.
[02:10:16.765 --> 02:10:20.529]  After about three months, four months of research in this case, I had to get grounded.
[02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:26.235]  I had to get with somebody in law enforcement or former law enforcement that really knew the nuts and bolts of this case.
[02:10:26.776 --> 02:10:32.222]  And that's when I first met Craig Roberts at Tulsa, drove up there, met with him for the better part of a day, and he laid it all out for me.
[02:10:32.822 --> 02:10:40.010]  And of course he did an absolutely stellar job of getting the original cache of information together on Teriyaki.
[02:10:40.311 --> 02:10:44.275]  He handed me his dossier, a copy of it, and says, you want to run with this, go right ahead.
[02:10:45.036 --> 02:10:46.898]  And Craig is really, he's one of the
[02:10:47.779 --> 02:10:48.580]  The underpinnings.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:50.663]  He's an excellent source of information on this.
[02:10:51.043 --> 02:10:51.103]  Why?
[02:10:51.444 --> 02:10:55.589]  Because he was actually asked by the FBI office in Tulsa to come on and investigate for them.
[02:10:55.969 --> 02:11:04.360]  They knew that he had the goods and the resources and basically the inside scoop on people that may or may not have known who actually committed this crime.
[02:11:04.921 --> 02:11:06.943]  And then the second person, of course, was Javier Heidelberg.
[02:11:07.244 --> 02:11:11.310]  So you go from former law enforcement to a gentleman that was actually on the grand jury.
[02:11:11.690 --> 02:11:15.355]  And after that, I says, my gosh, you know, we've got to get a clear focus on this.
[02:11:15.976 --> 02:11:21.584]  And then people like James came forward and he was able to put the gel to this whole thing together.
[02:11:21.744 --> 02:11:26.625]  Well, what we tried to do with this movie is to actually just boil it down to the most provable essence.
[02:11:26.725 --> 02:11:32.227]  And, you know, like, no matter if you know everything about the bombing or nothing about the bombing, you're going to walk away with new information.
[02:11:32.587 --> 02:11:33.867]  We didn't want to just preach to the choir.
[02:11:33.907 --> 02:11:38.969]  We actually wanted to give activists and, you know, people that are awake a tool that they can use to wake others up.
[02:11:39.309 --> 02:11:44.552]  And so we actually go through the official story at the beginning of the movie and then deconstruct how it is a lie.
[02:11:44.613 --> 02:11:54.939]  And I think, you know, in the beginning we're covering the Oklahoma bombing investigation committee's information, their research that has stood, you know, without any, you know, dissent yet.
[02:11:55.039 --> 02:11:56.740]  In fact, that came out a few weeks before 9-11.
[02:11:57.081 --> 02:12:01.904]  It was meant to get a congressional hearing on the case and then 9-11 completely overshadowed it.
[02:12:02.544 --> 02:12:10.511]  Uh, then we get into the information, uh, more recently, uh, that researchers like Wendy Painting has been doing, actually going through the, uh, defense archives, and then Jesse Trinidou, of course.
[02:12:10.551 --> 02:12:14.615]  I mean, you've had him on the show before, uh, Alex, and, and that guy is just, uh, amazing.
[02:12:14.635 --> 02:12:24.344]  He's from the hills of Kentucky, and, uh, his brother was brutally murdered at the federal transfer facility, and he said, you know, you killed one of my family members, you better kill all of us, because we're not gonna stop until we get some justice.
[02:12:24.804 --> 02:12:25.745]  We're good to go.
[02:12:55.284 --> 02:12:57.986]  Well, we never could get a definitive source on that.
[02:12:58.366 --> 02:12:59.707]  We think it's mere coincidence.
[02:12:59.767 --> 02:13:03.589]  In fact, the government does rent out Ryder trucks quite often.
[02:13:03.610 --> 02:13:05.491]  They had a contract with Ryder at the time.
[02:13:05.551 --> 02:13:07.792]  So, it may have been just a coincidental overlap.
[02:13:07.952 --> 02:13:11.815]  What about the video that Larry Flint and Hustler went with?
[02:13:12.495 --> 02:13:20.523]  It was sent to us and then later sent to Hustler, where it looks just like McVeigh a year after he's supposedly out of the military at that demolitions base.
[02:13:21.064 --> 02:13:26.629]  Again, we weren't able to include some of the information in the movie, but I did speak with Bill Bean yesterday, and we are going to put out a YouTube video.
[02:13:26.669 --> 02:13:28.211]  We have an extensive interview with him.
[02:13:28.551 --> 02:13:31.854]  We have his original footage, and we're going to be getting that out within the next week.
[02:13:32.655 --> 02:13:34.297]  So yeah, you know, keep an eye out for that.
[02:13:34.317 --> 02:13:35.278]  What's your view on that?
[02:13:35.598 --> 02:13:38.500]  Clearly, Terry Nichols and others have signed affidavits now.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.701]  This is what the other witnesses said.
[02:13:40.021 --> 02:13:55.952]  McVeigh, who was highly decorated, was taken sheep-dipped, put into security, and told he was basically, like you said, assassinating people, helping run drugs in the country for national security, of course, and getting ready to set up domestic groups.
[02:13:55.972 --> 02:13:57.734]  Then, of course, they set him up.
[02:13:58.737 --> 02:13:59.377]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:59.517 --> 02:14:05.520]  And you know, when you look at the death certificate after McVeigh was supposedly executed, it says his occupation is U.S.
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:05.900]  Army.
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:07.921]  You know, I mean, it just gets ridiculous.
[02:14:08.001 --> 02:14:09.442]  Anybody can go look that one up.
[02:14:10.182 --> 02:14:14.404]  But I'll tell you what's crazy is I have a, I mean, it must be like every 10 people or something.
[02:14:14.724 --> 02:14:20.467]  I go to family reunions and stuff and have family and people who are, most of them are like former Army officers and
[02:14:21.267 --> 02:14:26.233]  Off record, they were all recruited by the CIA, but then got out for different reasons.
[02:14:26.253 --> 02:14:29.377]  And it was usually, I won't deal drugs and kill people in America.
[02:14:29.697 --> 02:14:35.824]  So it's the army, is from my research, is where they get most of the ground level drug dealing murderers.
[02:14:35.964 --> 02:14:36.705]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:14:36.725 --> 02:14:38.247]  They must have a giant army of them.
[02:14:39.025 --> 02:14:46.032]  One thing a lot of people don't realize, McVeigh was actually on the security detail for General Schwarzkopf in the first Persian Gulf War.
[02:14:46.132 --> 02:14:46.993]  He was a sharpshooter.
[02:14:47.293 --> 02:14:53.038]  He got an award for his service actually when he was in custody at the Denver County Jail awaiting federal trial.
[02:14:53.439 --> 02:14:55.000]  So McVeigh was not a pushover in the Army.
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:55.681]  He was pretty sharp.
[02:14:56.241 --> 02:14:57.883]  Now you were talking about the multiple trucks.
[02:14:57.943 --> 02:15:13.042]  Now, James Sargent actually retired from an extensive military career and then went fishing at the lake there in Kansas, at Gary State Lake, where McVeigh supposedly was setting up the Ryder truck with the ammonium nitrate and fuel.
[02:15:13.342 --> 02:15:14.804]  He saw it days before
[02:15:14.804 --> 02:15:15.284]  We're good to go.
[02:15:44.887 --> 02:15:45.668]  We're good to go.
[02:16:10.103 --> 02:16:25.026]  Expanding on that we have the all the different video cameras and we have FBI agents of the LA Times and Washington Times Saying I saw McVeigh with these other men getting in and out and that they've declared national security on the tapes Yeah, exactly every single person every witness
[02:16:25.046 --> 02:16:25.146]  Yes.
[02:16:41.817 --> 02:16:43.979]  If everybody's been brought to justice, why can't we see them?
[02:16:44.299 --> 02:16:46.621]  You know, Jesse Trinidou tries to get access to the tapes.
[02:16:47.041 --> 02:16:47.942]  Their story keeps changing.
[02:16:47.962 --> 02:16:48.923]  They say, well, we can't find them.
[02:16:48.943 --> 02:16:53.626]  It was the biggest manhunt in history, biggest investigation in history at that time, and they can't find the tapes.
[02:16:53.646 --> 02:16:54.287]  That's ridiculous.
[02:16:54.567 --> 02:17:03.474]  Then they leak out some of them, and they all go blank at 9.02 a.m., and they say, well, they were all these different buildings with different security companies all changed their tapes at 9.02 a.m.
[02:17:03.794 --> 02:17:04.715]  It just gets ludicrous.
[02:17:04.895 --> 02:17:07.616]  We went back to the ADT Security Service.
[02:17:07.736 --> 02:17:11.098]  Their building, coincidentally, was less than two blocks from the Murrah Building.
[02:17:11.518 --> 02:17:15.019]  Went back to the supervisor and he says, no, there was nothing wrong with those cameras.
[02:17:15.359 --> 02:17:19.061]  They had checked them less than two weeks before the bombing happened on routine maintenance.
[02:17:19.321 --> 02:17:21.042]  They're basically the service reps.
[02:17:21.422 --> 02:17:24.083]  Went to the Murrah Building and said, yeah, these cameras are working fine.
[02:17:24.243 --> 02:17:24.883]  No worries here.
[02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:26.264]  Pay your bill and we're on our way.
[02:17:27.637 --> 02:17:48.375]  Well that's like Princess Diana where all the cameras turn off right as it happens and then her own letter comes out and the video but the government seized it where she said Prince Charles says he's gonna kill me in a fake auto accident and then we're the conspiracy theorist for not buying the official story of Diana when she said Charles is gonna kill me and how he said he was gonna do it.
[02:17:49.659 --> 02:17:52.080]  Yeah, I mean, it's a pattern that we see time and time again, you know.
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.801]  They never want to let the tapes out.
[02:17:54.221 --> 02:18:03.164]  And, you know, I think the final court decision there was the CIA came forward and said that it would pose a grave risk to national security if these tapes were to be released.
[02:18:03.604 --> 02:18:07.926]  You know, we're supposed to forget that John Doe number two ever existed, you know, is the greatest manhunt in history.
[02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:10.487]  That's right, the government said national security!
[02:18:10.987 --> 02:18:14.949]  Just like when the Sinaloa cartel said, we ship drugs in for America, you ship us guns.
[02:18:15.249 --> 02:18:17.450]  The government came in and said, it's true, national security.
[02:18:18.570 --> 02:18:32.361]  Well, another very peculiar aspect on this, the research was, there are agencies, Alex, that we never knew even existed out of Washington and Langley, Virginia, that are popping up on the FOIA requests, that we know that they showed up at the crime scene that morning.
[02:18:32.942 --> 02:18:35.464]  And it's like, wow, where did this agency come from?
[02:18:35.504 --> 02:18:36.525]  Where did these people come from?
[02:18:36.945 --> 02:18:46.813]  If it was a lone nut driving an anthro-laden truck bomb in front of a building, why do you have some of the top 14 agencies, some of them that we never knew existed, show up in Oklahoma City?
[02:18:49.076 --> 02:18:54.282]  It's amazing.
[02:18:54.322 --> 02:18:55.663]  Lies after lies after lies.
[02:18:55.803 --> 02:19:01.230]  So this film, we know that we really are clarifying a lot of those concerns and bringing out information nobody's ever seen before.
[02:19:02.751 --> 02:19:14.819]  You got Mark Penn, who is head of a PR firm that specializes in public relations for, you know, genocidal third-world dictators, saying that the only thing that's going to save the Obama administration is another Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:19:15.199 --> 02:19:18.921]  You know, I mean, they're ramping up for it, and I think we're overdue for another false flag.
[02:19:18.961 --> 02:19:25.445]  And so getting the word out, you know, going to the InfoWars store, buying the DVD, spreading this information, this could actually save lives, I think.
[02:19:25.705 --> 02:19:29.488]  I know you guys spent, what, I mean, three or four years getting this done.
[02:19:30.248 --> 02:19:32.310]  Yeah, I mean, it was, you know, years of research.
[02:19:32.370 --> 02:19:35.832]  Almost, you know, 16 years of research that we incorporated into the movie.
[02:19:35.872 --> 02:19:40.076]  But yes, it was over a year and a half in production because we wanted to have that high quality.
[02:19:40.096 --> 02:19:42.217]  Yeah, because I remember Chris talking to me about this like two years ago.
[02:19:42.558 --> 02:19:45.960]  All right, guys, it's available at InfoWars.com, The Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, 95.
[02:19:46.741 --> 02:19:47.381]  Everybody get it.
[02:19:47.642 --> 02:19:49.903]  And let's go ahead and get you guys set up for next week.
[02:19:49.943 --> 02:19:53.426]  We need to talk about some of the other witnesses you want to bring in for next week's interview.
[02:19:53.766 --> 02:19:54.247]  Amazing.
[02:19:54.387 --> 02:19:55.468]  Bob Chapman straight ahead.

[02:24:21.283 --> 02:24:29.732]  Editor of the internationalforecaster.com and frequent guest Friday analyst, Bob Chapman is with us for the next 40 minutes until this Friday edition ends.
[02:24:30.393 --> 02:24:32.955]  I'll be back, of course, live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:24:32.995 --> 02:24:33.376]  Central.
[02:24:33.416 --> 02:24:36.079]  Hope that you will join us for that.
[02:24:36.099 --> 02:24:41.705]  I've gotten to a lot of the news that's taking place, but I wanted to, before we get into the economics with Bob where he's really the expert,
[02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:45.022]  Uh, fighting the Globals for 50 plus years.
[02:24:45.062 --> 02:24:50.206]  I wanted to ask Bob, the NDAA passes, Obama says he wants to kill it secretly.
[02:24:50.546 --> 02:24:51.967]  He's the one that wanted it all along.
[02:24:52.027 --> 02:24:54.750]  That's now, uh, gone public.
[02:24:56.105 --> 02:25:01.531]  And then on top of that, we have the open announcement now.
[02:25:01.631 --> 02:25:04.774]  Okay, the government does want to selectively shut down any free speech they want.
[02:25:05.635 --> 02:25:08.739]  Okay, we may start taking pension funds.
[02:25:08.919 --> 02:25:11.141]  Okay, we're going to use drones on you.
[02:25:11.522 --> 02:25:14.425]  I mean, it's even moving faster than I thought, Bob.
[02:25:14.745 --> 02:25:17.268]  They must know that they're getting ready to really collapse things.
[02:25:17.988 --> 02:25:19.770]  Have you ever seen anything move this quick?
[02:25:19.850 --> 02:25:23.074]  And what's your view on all the movement we're seeing?
[02:25:23.274 --> 02:25:26.617]  They're really trying to batten down the hatches on the American people.
[02:25:26.637 --> 02:25:28.059]  And the same stuff's happening in Europe.
[02:25:28.459 --> 02:25:29.741]  Same thing's happening in Asia.
[02:25:29.761 --> 02:25:31.202]  I mean, this is the big one.
[02:25:31.242 --> 02:25:33.144]  I mean, are they getting ready for World War III?
[02:25:33.164 --> 02:25:33.665]  What's happening?
[02:25:35.094 --> 02:25:44.344]  Well, I think there could be a succession of wars as well as a World War III, and I think they'd open up with smaller actions and graduate into larger ones.
[02:25:45.725 --> 02:25:51.871]  As far as the President signing this piece of legislation, of course.
[02:25:54.869 --> 02:26:03.694]  The reference you made to it happening all over the world, the expeditious process, you're right about that.
[02:26:04.774 --> 02:26:08.276]  You've got two, well you've got a number of major elections coming up.
[02:26:09.937 --> 02:26:17.121]  The first real important one that I'm able to cite here is in France in May and June.
[02:26:18.559 --> 02:26:28.542]  And, uh, I don't know if you've discussed this in the program or not, uh, there's three parties, uh, the center party, which is in office, Mr. Sarkozy.
[02:26:28.842 --> 02:26:29.423]  Sarkozy.
[02:26:29.563 --> 02:26:29.983]  Sarkozy.
[02:26:30.903 --> 02:26:33.024]  Sometimes I get that nickname mixed up.
[02:26:33.744 --> 02:26:40.326]  And, uh, and then you have the, uh, candidate from the Socialists, which happens to be pretty far to the left.
[02:26:41.046 --> 02:26:44.447]  And then you have Marine Le Pen.
[02:26:46.793 --> 02:26:50.936]  She is getting polled at around 21% right now.
[02:26:51.836 --> 02:26:58.201]  And I think she'll build up to a 26% before the election and be one of the two parties that'll run in June.
[02:26:58.221 --> 02:27:12.610]  Now what's significant about her is that she's already said, look, what we're going to do here is get out of the Euro, we're going to get out of the European Union, and we're going to get rid of all these illegal aliens.
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:16.441]  And she's got a big shot at it.
[02:27:17.381 --> 02:27:28.605]  And if she becomes the President of France, or PM, whichever it is, that's going to throw a bombshell into what's going on in Europe.
[02:27:29.025 --> 02:27:30.146]  The bankers hate her.
[02:27:30.166 --> 02:27:32.846]  The bankers hated her father even more.
[02:27:33.727 --> 02:27:43.070]  And I must tell you that the Le Pen family is a very good friend of mine, and friends of mine, and I have to tell you that I'm a little prejudiced.
[02:27:44.301 --> 02:27:51.664]  Well, certainly they get demonized for a reason because they're nationalistic and the globalists don't like that, kind of like Margaret Thatcher was.
[02:27:52.904 --> 02:27:54.064]  What is going on in Europe?
[02:27:54.104 --> 02:28:10.790]  I mean, obviously they're saying the banks are taking over, but if I wanted to ask you about this, Cameron comes out and says, vetoes Euro expansion when he's always tried to block the British people from being able to have a vote to get out of the Euro, which they never voted to enter.
[02:28:11.130 --> 02:28:12.391]  What's really happening there?
[02:28:13.612 --> 02:28:15.473]  Well, I'm so glad you brought this up.
[02:28:16.594 --> 02:28:21.838]  Because, number one, I don't know which way they're going on it, but I'm going to give you two versions.
[02:28:22.699 --> 02:28:24.000]  You see the current version.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:36.729]  The excuse is that the other members of the Eurozone wanted to put a 1% tax on transactions in the City of London.
[02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:39.651]  I deplore them, but that's not the point.
[02:28:39.691 --> 02:28:40.312]  That's unfair.
[02:28:41.394 --> 02:28:44.014]  That's got around 15 or 20% of volume.
[02:28:45.155 --> 02:28:47.395]  That means business would move over to Frankfurt.
[02:28:48.755 --> 02:28:56.857]  Now, she might just as well as punch Mr. Cameron in the nose, or the British people in the nose, is to put something up like that.
[02:28:57.597 --> 02:28:59.817]  So I think there's another reason here.
[02:29:01.037 --> 02:29:08.779]  And I think the reason could very well be 65% of the Germans don't want to be in the Euro, or in the Eurozone.
[02:29:10.339 --> 02:29:10.479]  The
[02:29:13.268 --> 02:29:20.252]  The situation with the debt in the six countries that are virtually bankrupt, they don't want to continue to support these people.
[02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:26.875]  Since the inception of the Euro, 66% of men and 71% of women, and that's some years ago.
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:31.160]  Did not want it at that time.
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:32.141]  Alright, well stay there.
[02:29:32.181 --> 02:29:33.001]  We gotta go to break, Bob.
[02:29:33.021 --> 02:29:34.901]  Let's talk about why this is so important.
[02:29:35.321 --> 02:29:41.423]  Because this is the attempt to set up world government through the European Union, as we knew they would always do.
[02:29:41.783 --> 02:29:47.524]  And if they're not able to get this done, this could really be a crippling blow to the globalists.
[02:29:48.405 --> 02:29:48.825]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.945 --> 02:29:51.846]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.346 --> 02:29:53.926]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.866 --> 02:29:57.547]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.548 --> 02:30:02.669]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:02.709 --> 02:30:09.413]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.653 --> 02:30:11.934]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:12.215 --> 02:30:17.418]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.578 --> 02:30:20.359]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:22.701]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.941 --> 02:30:28.865]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:29.185 --> 02:30:32.387]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.567 --> 02:30:38.111]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:38.351 --> 02:30:39.652]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.992 --> 02:30:41.213]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:41.293 --> 02:30:43.834]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.975 --> 02:30:48.017]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:48.197 --> 02:30:50.219]  You can find the video at www.
[02:30:50.979 --> 02:30:52.680]  End of America 3.com.
[02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:55.242]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:31:03.117 --> 02:31:06.758]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:07.078 --> 02:31:15.200]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:19.961]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.561 --> 02:31:31.383]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:32.023 --> 02:31:41.026]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.526 --> 02:31:46.568]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.948 --> 02:31:54.131]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.451 --> 02:31:57.192]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:02.310 --> 02:32:05.951]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.331 --> 02:32:09.332]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.572 --> 02:32:14.353]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:32:14.373 --> 02:32:20.575]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.755 --> 02:32:22.996]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.536 --> 02:32:23.816]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.836 --> 02:32:24.076]  Bernanke?
[02:32:24.096 --> 02:32:24.696]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.716 --> 02:32:25.677]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:25.697 --> 02:32:27.797]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.441 --> 02:32:49.344]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:32:49.724 --> 02:32:58.827]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:06.591 --> 02:33:06.631]  Oh,
[02:33:33.433 --> 02:33:38.595]  That's what I tell myself every time I want to interrupt somebody because I got this point I want to make and I'm like a little dog barking.
[02:33:40.376 --> 02:33:51.741]  But I, you know, that's also an attribute that I'm upset by things, that I'm irritated by the public being conned and losing basic freedoms, and then I have an instinct and a drive to want to warn people.
[02:33:52.721 --> 02:33:57.823]  And you should have that too, and obviously most of you who are listeners have that same drive, and that's why you're here.
[02:33:59.284 --> 02:34:02.045]  But now, more importantly than ever,
[02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:04.527]  We're not tooting our horn.
[02:34:04.667 --> 02:34:14.290]  We're not confidently, myself included, producing newscasts and documents that illustrate to others how right we've been.
[02:34:14.310 --> 02:34:16.390]  Now there is a world government.
[02:34:16.450 --> 02:34:17.610]  Now it's not denied.
[02:34:17.991 --> 02:34:20.391]  Now it's a police state coming out to the people.
[02:34:20.811 --> 02:34:28.153]  It's a collectivist model based on phony environmentalism as a pretext to selectively financially destroy people.
[02:34:31.894 --> 02:34:32.254]  It's here.
[02:34:32.794 --> 02:34:33.355]  We were right.
[02:34:33.895 --> 02:34:34.775]  We warned the people.
[02:34:34.835 --> 02:34:37.916]  The globalists stalled the public while trying to get this in place.
[02:34:38.456 --> 02:34:39.677]  Now they're imploding Europe.
[02:34:39.717 --> 02:34:43.618]  In fact, I have an article here I wanted to raise to Bob.
[02:34:44.819 --> 02:34:47.400]  It's out of Time Magazine.
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:53.682]  Out of chaos order, IMF seeks collective world bailout of Europe.
[02:34:55.046 --> 02:34:59.167]  And they go on to say how great it is and that we're going to bail out the Europeans.
[02:34:59.207 --> 02:35:05.649]  When it's not Europeans, it's the mega banks who are getting the bailout and who engineered the fraud.
[02:35:05.669 --> 02:35:12.611]  And they count on the public being ignorant about this and just, oh, we're going to raise your taxes to save Europe, those lazy Europeans.
[02:35:13.091 --> 02:35:19.233]  And so you're bringing up the point that, yeah, I mean, the polls are 70, 80, in some cases even higher, against the euro.
[02:35:19.273 --> 02:35:21.514]  Most countries weren't allowed to vote to be in it or out of it.
[02:35:23.055 --> 02:35:27.359]  And now you've got England and other European blocs jockeying for who gets the big position in it.
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:29.261]  So where do you see it going?
[02:35:29.281 --> 02:35:35.567]  I mean, obviously, time is not on their side, as we said a year ago when Brzezinski started warning the elite, hey, we're in trouble.
[02:35:35.808 --> 02:35:46.518]  Because once you look past the puppet Obama, the puppet Merkel, Sarkozy, Cameron, and you look to the banker, money manipulator, money changer, once you're aware of that fraud,
[02:35:47.697 --> 02:35:49.599]  Then how do they ever get themselves out of it?
[02:35:49.919 --> 02:35:53.221]  Okay, start shutting down the web, start arresting people.
[02:35:53.782 --> 02:35:55.363]  I mean, you think that's really going to work?
[02:35:55.923 --> 02:35:57.685]  It never works long term.
[02:35:58.185 --> 02:36:01.408]  And because we got the jump on them, Bob, historically...
[02:36:02.284 --> 02:36:05.967]  I mean, they are in the news today going, well, I guess they're going to shut down free speech.
[02:36:06.007 --> 02:36:07.007]  I guess it's what's needed.
[02:36:07.628 --> 02:36:09.689]  I guess the Pentagon really is going to do all this.
[02:36:10.049 --> 02:36:16.234]  I mean, you've got the top 80 inventors of the Internet going public saying, America is falling to an authoritarian system.
[02:36:16.474 --> 02:36:17.835]  This is a worldwide treaty.
[02:36:18.095 --> 02:36:19.316]  A new dark age is upon us.
[02:36:19.816 --> 02:36:21.818]  Everyone's starting to sound like Alex Jones.
[02:36:22.438 --> 02:36:28.440]  I have so many guests on who years ago would go, Alex, you go a little far, like Lord Monckton or Sheriff Mack or anybody.
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:30.100]  They're like, no, you were exactly right.
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:30.900]  You were right.
[02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:31.940]  How did you know this?
[02:36:32.301 --> 02:36:34.501]  Because I studied history in their own documents.
[02:36:34.801 --> 02:36:41.823]  Now, Bob, you saw this long ago before I was born, and you were always seen as hardcore because you would break it all down.
[02:36:41.863 --> 02:36:47.144]  But this is like two runaway trains going right towards each other.
[02:36:47.384 --> 02:36:48.645]  So where do you see Europe going?
[02:36:49.085 --> 02:36:49.925]  What do you see happening?
[02:36:52.632 --> 02:37:10.083]  The facts that I was bringing out was the history of the German people and their reaction to the beginnings of the Euro, and then the European Union, and then that they were forced into absorbing Eastern Germany, which was a disaster area.
[02:37:10.724 --> 02:37:14.126]  And then they had to go one for one on the currency.
[02:37:14.146 --> 02:37:15.667]  It should have been 30-50 to one.
[02:37:16.627 --> 02:37:20.150]  Now, with that said, they're sick and tired of paying the price.
[02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:20.810]  They want out.
[02:37:21.297 --> 02:37:36.953]  And I think there's tremendous pressure within Germany, and that's why I'm considering that the whole thing with England was a setup, because just on the face of it, to ask them to pay this tax and nobody else is ridiculous.
[02:37:38.118 --> 02:37:42.242]  I think Germany wants out of the Euro and out of the European Union.
[02:37:55.458 --> 02:38:04.667]  A couple of weeks ago that you thought MF Global was a shell corporation they'd set up and that the loss was actually upping the ante for the other bet they'd made that was a win that was a transfer.
[02:38:05.347 --> 02:38:08.230]  And now that's what Zero Hedge that's heavily connected.
[02:38:08.250 --> 02:38:15.357]  They're a bunch of super successful brokers in New York that run that under the gnome-to-gare, gnome-to-plume Tyler Durgan.
[02:38:16.881 --> 02:38:20.904]  And they're saying that that's probably what's going on from some of the information they have.
[02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:23.646]  But how do you square that, then, with Corzine?
[02:38:24.047 --> 02:38:25.768]  And I don't think Max Keiser makes stuff up.
[02:38:26.208 --> 02:38:27.789]  Keiser does have a lot of big connections.
[02:38:27.829 --> 02:38:33.634]  He says that the head of JP Morgan, which was reported by Bloomberg and others, that that's where the money went.
[02:38:33.674 --> 02:38:36.296]  Now they say they don't know where it went, like the feds don't know where it went.
[02:38:36.336 --> 02:38:39.338]  I mean, who buys that a month and a half in, or even 24 hours in?
[02:38:39.358 --> 02:38:40.198]  This is ridiculous.
[02:38:40.218 --> 02:38:44.662]  I mean, they know where you money transfer, they know what's in your bank account, they know who you pay.
[02:38:44.722 --> 02:38:45.923]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:38:46.483 --> 02:38:57.351]  But Kaiser saying that the head of Goldman Sachs said, I'm going to have you killed if you don't loot those accounts and give us that money that you lost speculating.
[02:38:57.772 --> 02:38:59.113]  So what do you make of all this?
[02:38:59.253 --> 02:39:05.638]  Or would they order him to make that bet and transfer and then still say, we don't care, give us money on top of it?
[02:39:05.938 --> 02:39:11.142]  Because we know Goldman Sachs is the Darth Vader enforcer for Emperor Palpatine, Goldman Sachs.
[02:39:12.142 --> 02:39:16.445]  Goldman Sachs is the enforcer to Emperor Palpatine, JP Morgan Chase.
[02:39:18.006 --> 02:39:40.798]  Well I think either versions are fine and I think Max is probably good information and I think one of the things that people should notice here that I think has been misconstrued and that is presently and in the past you could have
[02:39:42.485 --> 02:39:49.907]  Hypothecation and re-hypothecation, but only, only in a margin account, no matter where it was.
[02:39:50.728 --> 02:39:55.089]  And it's a perfectly legitimate and normal operating procedure.
[02:39:55.669 --> 02:39:58.730]  A lot of people don't know about that because they don't read their contracts.
[02:39:59.730 --> 02:40:02.111]  They can't do that in a cash account.
[02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:06.512]  Unless they just rush into some company and steal everybody's stock.
[02:40:07.012 --> 02:40:09.593]  And then they have the United States government all over them because
[02:40:10.239 --> 02:40:12.201]  The big money is made in those markets.
[02:40:12.541 --> 02:40:14.984]  Commodity markets are less than 1% of the action.
[02:40:15.565 --> 02:40:18.268]  The bond market is 100 times bigger than the stock market.
[02:40:18.848 --> 02:40:21.531]  So the stock and bond market is where they make their money.
[02:40:21.911 --> 02:40:24.134]  They're not going to try to shut that thing down.
[02:40:25.774 --> 02:40:31.618]  So, is this a backhanded attack against gold speculation, as we've seen the last year, raising margin calls?
[02:40:32.178 --> 02:40:40.822]  Is this an attack against farmers and others hedging their bets on crops and people making money in the gold market?
[02:40:41.063 --> 02:40:48.006]  Because that's why we've seen gold and silver plunge, Kaiser and others are saying, is because now people don't trust the gold and silver commodity markets.
[02:40:49.547 --> 02:40:51.328]  Well, that's true to an extent.
[02:40:51.348 --> 02:40:52.889]  We don't know, we're only guessing,
[02:40:53.587 --> 02:40:58.508]  And the fallout for the comics in regard to gold and silver.
[02:40:59.169 --> 02:41:05.330]  The number of contracts have dropped, but as of yesterday, it's starting to move back up again.
[02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:08.271]  And so that is hard to judge at this time.
[02:41:08.891 --> 02:41:12.572]  But it would be natural to say, gee, I don't want to play there anymore if they're doing that.
[02:41:12.692 --> 02:41:20.894]  But anybody who knows anything knows you signed a letter that said they can go take the things in your account and use them.
[02:41:21.675 --> 02:41:22.815]  And it's as simple as that.
[02:41:24.412 --> 02:41:40.936]  Now, as far as the part that Morgan played in this, I think it could be either way that you described, whether they're involved at all in anything that they shouldn't be doing.
[02:41:41.376 --> 02:41:43.577]  We just don't know that yet, and will we ever know?
[02:41:43.997 --> 02:41:44.597]  I don't know.
[02:41:45.517 --> 02:41:48.958]  All I know is that people
[02:41:49.511 --> 02:41:52.293]  Around their accounts, I think people are going to get paid back.
[02:41:52.494 --> 02:41:53.234]  Will they get it all?
[02:41:53.655 --> 02:41:54.255]  I don't know.
[02:41:54.756 --> 02:41:56.617]  Will they get 50 or 75 percent?
[02:41:57.038 --> 02:41:57.678]  Probably.
[02:41:58.599 --> 02:42:08.507]  Now, the people who have been talking about this are extending it and they're saying all the markets in the world are going to collapse.
[02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:12.551]  All the markets in the world are not going to collapse.
[02:42:12.571 --> 02:42:17.295]  They're going to go down in value and maybe eventually we'll use the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[02:42:18.081 --> 02:42:26.766]  Maybe it'll eventually go down to, over the next several years, to perhaps 3,000 or 2,000 on the Dow.
[02:42:27.587 --> 02:42:31.829]  Now, of all of this, what can be a solution?
[02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:33.890]  It's very simple.
[02:42:34.631 --> 02:42:36.532]  Elect Ron Paul.
[02:42:37.652 --> 02:42:39.854]  He's the only way out for us.
[02:42:40.714 --> 02:42:41.955]  He can stop all that.
[02:42:42.675 --> 02:42:47.198]  He can stop the President's Working Group on Financial Markets by doing away with its
[02:42:47.796 --> 02:42:51.417]  They won't be able to legally manipulate and rig the markets anymore.
[02:42:51.738 --> 02:42:55.299]  He'll take the Federal Reserve and put it inside the Treasury Department.
[02:42:55.779 --> 02:42:58.800]  And he'll go on and on and on with all of these different things.
[02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:00.781]  I agree with you, but let me raise this point.
[02:43:01.041 --> 02:43:02.642]  Ron Paul gets elected.
[02:43:03.702 --> 02:43:11.826]  He'll admit false flags if it's Fast and Furious or Tompkins or Ajax, but he won't get into 9-11, which is fine, because that's more of a quagmire.
[02:43:13.038 --> 02:43:28.349]  Uh, the others are cut and dry and admitted government operations, but to claim that it's asinine to question who's behind something when government stands to gain and they're writing memos about how terror attacks help them take over, I mean, that's a crazy person that doesn't look at any event and question it.
[02:43:29.668 --> 02:43:42.000]  What happens if Ron Paul gets in office, and the globalists then stage a bunch of terror attacks and say, see, the Arabs see you as weak, and you didn't attack all these countries, so now you've got to attack all these nations.
[02:43:43.241 --> 02:43:44.362]  Or the terrorists will strike.
[02:43:45.183 --> 02:43:50.448]  At that point, Paul's got to come out and use the government areas he controls to point out it's a fraud.
[02:43:50.748 --> 02:43:52.450]  And I guess he did do that on my show Tuesday.
[02:43:52.470 --> 02:43:55.152]  I mean, he did say the thing was a false flag.
[02:43:55.172 --> 02:43:59.616]  That's his words, claiming Iran wanted to kill the Saudi ambassador in D.C.
[02:44:00.197 --> 02:44:04.241]  So Paul, Paul is, Paul is, he understands that.
[02:44:04.261 --> 02:44:05.301]  He's incredibly smart.
[02:44:05.982 --> 02:44:07.503]  He is our only hope, politically.
[02:44:07.543 --> 02:44:08.704]  We've got to get him elected.
[02:44:36.249 --> 02:44:38.910]  People have got to help him with financing.
[02:44:38.950 --> 02:44:42.892]  Today's a money-raising day for his campaign.
[02:44:44.133 --> 02:44:48.134]  Everybody should be pledging $1,000 each if they can.
[02:44:49.035 --> 02:44:52.156]  This is our only chance to legally use the system.
[02:44:52.716 --> 02:45:05.022]  And if we can get him and people like him elected, all of these things, like this military appropriations bill, which will allow the government to treat us all as terrorists, they can get rid of that.
[02:45:06.588 --> 02:45:11.315]  And when presented to the people, if Congress stops it, he can have them climb all over them.
[02:45:11.716 --> 02:45:16.563]  No, no, listen, Bob, I agree with you that the best salvo we've got going is Ron Paul.
[02:45:16.843 --> 02:45:19.046]  He's educating people, he's waking folks up.
[02:45:19.948 --> 02:45:22.531]  It's a wonderful focal point, but he himself will say...
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:32.367]  That campaign for liberty, getting people to run in the states for governor, for city council, for state legislature, who will do the same thing.
[02:45:32.387 --> 02:45:35.229]  I mean, that really is important as well.
[02:45:35.909 --> 02:45:39.792]  I'm just saying, if Ron Paul doesn't get elected, we soldier on.
[02:45:39.832 --> 02:45:41.434]  But yes, it would be wonderful
[02:45:42.394 --> 02:46:02.357]  To get him in there and and and such a godsend, but I'm just saying the process of him fighting and everybody supporting him That is resistance right there and it's a trailblazing and opening up inroads To people that have never been exposed to true liberty and we do have the article up at info wars comm right now get out to everybody tea time today's the tea party date and
[02:46:02.677 --> 02:46:03.418]  I think his take
[02:46:29.159 --> 02:46:33.682]  On the expansion of American militarism is perfect.
[02:46:34.983 --> 02:46:38.546]  And I talk to people in the military like you do all the time.
[02:46:39.747 --> 02:46:51.775]  And I believe that the military is at a point now, generally speaking, where they know what's going on, they know they're being used as cannon fodder, and they don't like it one bit.
[02:46:52.896 --> 02:46:57.539]  And if any president, such as Mr. Obama,
[02:46:57.995 --> 02:47:01.978]  I think that they can get people to go and start picking people up.
[02:47:01.998 --> 02:47:03.079]  They're sadly mistaken.
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:16.329]  Especially in the specialist units, such as the Rangers, Green Berets, Navy SEALs, and so on and so forth.
[02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:22.594]  There's a lot of talk going on in the military right now about just this.
[02:47:23.295 --> 02:47:24.956]  And they've been talking for the last few years.
[02:47:25.677 --> 02:47:27.258]  But now it's very, very strong.
[02:47:28.067 --> 02:47:34.150]  And so, their backing of Ron Paul is very strong, too, on a percentage basis.
[02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:37.452]  They were large contributors before, and they will be again.
[02:47:37.472 --> 02:47:42.054]  And I think that this is all to our good.
[02:47:42.894 --> 02:47:50.918]  We need these people, and we don't need them going out and collecting Alex and Bob and putting them in some camp someplace.
[02:47:53.683 --> 02:48:10.877]  Bob, I'm pulling up an article right now for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, but radio listeners can go to InfoWars.com, and it's Republican Tea Party diva attacks Ron Paul on Iran during Iowa debate, but under it, Ron Paul's constitutionalist anti-war stance supported by U.S.
[02:48:10.897 --> 02:48:19.244]  troops, and we have links in there that he gets more money than all of the Republican candidates and Obama combined.
[02:48:20.399 --> 02:48:24.881]  Okay, so that's the total proof that the military, by and large, is awake.
[02:48:25.802 --> 02:48:39.829]  Remember Bloomberg, last week, in their Businessweek edition, said, give this man money so he can fire you, and they made fun of the military and of federal employees for giving to him.
[02:48:39.849 --> 02:48:41.410]  Well, what do federal employees know?
[02:48:41.790 --> 02:48:45.813]  They know how corrupt it is, and they know that sometimes you gotta
[02:48:46.573 --> 02:48:48.734]  You know, have surgery just to survive.
[02:48:48.774 --> 02:48:51.836]  They understand there's no future if you don't cut it right now.
[02:48:52.216 --> 02:48:59.180]  And that's got to really panic the system, Bob, that, as you just said, more than everybody combined, the military gives to Ron Paul.
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:03.522]  So they're always trying to say, the troops hate Ron Paul because he doesn't want World War III.
[02:49:03.562 --> 02:49:04.643]  He's not manly.
[02:49:05.123 --> 02:49:09.146]  You know, the, I mean, literally, she looks like she's in a trance or something.
[02:49:09.166 --> 02:49:14.729]  Michelle Bachman, with those Barbie doll eyes, like she's got glass eyes, is attacking him
[02:49:15.789 --> 02:49:19.733]  And trying to hype up war, and it's totally hollow, the military supports him.
[02:49:19.973 --> 02:49:22.756]  That's gotta scare the system, Bob.
[02:49:23.917 --> 02:49:24.877]  Oh, it certainly does.
[02:49:25.718 --> 02:49:30.583]  And... These people all forget.
[02:49:30.603 --> 02:49:35.067]  I think it was six years he was in the military.
[02:49:35.907 --> 02:49:36.808]  The man's a veteran.
[02:49:38.149 --> 02:49:41.172]  I mean, how can opponents say such things?
[02:49:41.492 --> 02:49:42.073]  I don't get it.
[02:49:47.199 --> 02:49:48.920]  Well, it's certainly all coming to a head.
[02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:56.887]  My only point is, if Ron Paul doesn't win or whatever, we don't need to lose faith because just him running has devastated the enemy.
[02:49:59.228 --> 02:50:02.271]  It's going to devastate them a lot more when he gets that nomination.
[02:50:02.311 --> 02:50:03.552]  They're going to run like chickens.
[02:50:03.592 --> 02:50:05.293]  They've just got their heads lopped off.
[02:50:05.714 --> 02:50:08.015]  Go ahead.
[02:50:09.196 --> 02:50:10.437]  They don't expect this, Alex.
[02:50:10.477 --> 02:50:12.279]  They're not used to losing.
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:13.901]  No, I agree with you.
[02:50:13.921 --> 02:50:21.366]  They've thrown everything they can at him, and this mind control of he cannot win, he cannot win, like a hypnotist act, and that's starting to backfire.
[02:50:22.707 --> 02:50:25.589]  And they're getting, look at Rand Paul, the same thing.
[02:50:25.609 --> 02:50:40.660]  I mean, I remember privately, I really twisted Rand's arm, and I've been surprised that Paul and Rand have both told me, well, I'm glad you pushed me to run, because, you know, and I was one of the people, I think, put the little extra push, because I would tell them, I'd say, look, you're going to get attacked, but even if you lose, you win.
[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:41.540]  But I said, you're going to win.
[02:50:42.361 --> 02:50:47.945]  Well, people heard it with Rand Paul on air, back when he was thinking about running a couple years ago, and I'm like, you will run!
[02:50:48.766 --> 02:50:50.728]  He's like, oh, my wife, though, family.
[02:50:51.088 --> 02:50:52.169]  I'm like, Rand, you're gonna do it.
[02:50:53.230 --> 02:50:58.994]  They're gonna say, you know, that you sacrifice little kittens, but, and worship aqua turkeys, but it doesn't matter.
[02:50:59.615 --> 02:51:00.715]  Resistance is victory.
[02:51:00.755 --> 02:51:01.196]  Stay with us.

[02:52:01.366 --> 02:52:02.527]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.787 --> 02:52:13.253]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:52:13.453 --> 02:52:17.556]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:52:17.916 --> 02:52:20.338]  But we can't do that without your help.

[02:52:35.427 --> 02:52:41.070]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:52:41.570 --> 02:52:51.056]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:52:51.456 --> 02:52:52.616]  The war is here.
[02:52:52.957 --> 02:52:54.377]  It's an info war.
[02:52:54.858 --> 02:52:57.539]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:53:02.602 --> 02:53:05.764]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[02:54:14.814 --> 02:54:28.395]  I hurt myself today To see if I can still feel To see if I still feel I focus I focus On the pain
[02:54:29.775 --> 02:54:30.576]  The only thing.
[02:54:30.876 --> 02:54:42.029]  The inability to face legitimate suffering is the heart of decadence and weakness.
[02:54:48.632 --> 02:54:58.496]  People who think they can live in denial about what's happening in the world, who attack those of us that are conscious and awake and responsible citizens.
[02:55:03.958 --> 02:55:09.560]  We are on the verge of a very horrible time.
[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:14.302]  And those of you that have stood down, you are complicit in it.
[02:55:17.196 --> 02:55:18.176]  And what are you doing it for?
[02:55:18.236 --> 02:55:19.317]  An empire of dirt?
[02:55:21.498 --> 02:55:29.241]  Going along with what the mainstream media says, repeating and regurgitating what they say like it's cool and part of the system?
[02:55:30.321 --> 02:55:32.962]  To repeat what your enemies tell you?
[02:55:34.382 --> 02:55:36.163]  To play along with your own destruction?
[02:55:36.663 --> 02:55:39.504]  Final segment with Bob Chapman, final segment of this Friday edition.
[02:55:39.524 --> 02:55:43.266]  I want to go back to Bob and give him the final word on Ron Paul here in just a moment, but
[02:55:44.509 --> 02:55:46.079]  I talked to Joe Rogan yesterday.
[02:55:46.099 --> 02:55:46.964]  He's going to be on.
[02:55:49.417 --> 02:55:52.179]  Jay Leno's Tonight Show this evening with Ron Paul.
[02:55:52.199 --> 02:55:52.880]  That should be interesting.
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:56.583]  So definitely watch that because there might be a little surprise or something.
[02:55:58.264 --> 02:56:01.306]  And at the same time, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:01.346 --> 02:56:01.787]  Central.
[02:56:02.207 --> 02:56:04.269]  I will be live and I'm going to take a lot of phone calls Sunday.
[02:56:04.289 --> 02:56:05.890]  I'm going to take pretty much calls the whole show.
[02:56:06.510 --> 02:56:08.032]  So that should be an informative transmission.
[02:56:09.012 --> 02:56:11.034]  And then I'll be back Monday, Lord willing.
[02:56:11.234 --> 02:56:15.357]  And tonight, I won't be doing the show because Mike Adams is coming in with an investigative report.
[02:56:16.354 --> 02:56:21.196]  And a lot more, and they've got Man on the Street dealing with the internet kill switch with Darren McBreen.
[02:56:21.316 --> 02:56:22.837]  A lot tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:56:23.337 --> 02:56:30.341]  Don't forget, it's your memberships at PrisonPlanet.tv that fund the Nightly News, which then is paid forward and given to the public in different video forums.
[02:56:30.941 --> 02:56:34.503]  Over a million views a week now and growing, and it's going to get a lot bigger just with the Nightly News.
[02:56:34.843 --> 02:56:37.764]  Thanks to you spreading the word, but you who are the members make it all possible.
[02:56:38.145 --> 02:56:40.506]  We've got a 44% off on a yearly membership right now.
[02:56:41.266 --> 02:56:42.167]  We run every December.
[02:56:43.367 --> 02:56:49.531]  And also, you can get all 18 of my films for 70% off, $99.95, and do all your shopping at once.
[02:56:49.791 --> 02:56:53.953]  But you gotta get the orders in by Monday morning so that we can ship it out to everybody.
[02:56:54.654 --> 02:56:59.237]  Guaranteed before Christmas delivery if you order by Monday morning, you know, 9 a.m.
[02:56:59.277 --> 02:56:59.497]  or so.
[02:57:00.297 --> 02:57:01.658]  So, that's when we print off the orders.
[02:57:01.818 --> 02:57:08.804]  So, there it is, Anna Noble Lie, that excellent film exposing the false flag of Oklahoma City, all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:09.505 --> 02:57:15.810]  Final comment about where we stand at the historical crossroads, InternationalForecaster.com, Bob Chapman.
[02:57:17.191 --> 02:57:22.776]  Well, I think this coming year, you're going to see more and more confusion in Europe.
[02:57:24.546 --> 02:57:26.868]  Countries dropping out of the Eurozone.
[02:57:28.089 --> 02:57:35.136]  I think you're going to see a move back toward independence in Europe.
[02:57:35.736 --> 02:57:39.760]  We could see some thunder and lightning if Marine Le Pen gets elected in France.
[02:57:41.081 --> 02:57:51.370]  The strength of Ron Paul, if he does win the nomination of the Republican Party, that will be a very, very, very strong event.
[02:57:52.023 --> 02:57:58.487]  And if he's elected president, which I ideally hope he is, then we get a shot of saving America legally.
[02:57:59.668 --> 02:58:04.391]  And I think gold and silver will resume and start going right back up again.
[02:58:05.171 --> 02:58:08.013]  We've had an interlude caused by the United States government and others.
[02:58:08.033 --> 02:58:10.374]  That, I think, is over.
[02:58:10.394 --> 02:58:21.501]  I was on with Ted yesterday, Ted Anderson, and we both think this is a terrific time to buy and take advantage, too, of the free
[02:58:22.230 --> 02:58:24.671]  One year subscription to the International Forecaster.
[02:58:25.272 --> 02:58:25.992]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.113 --> 02:58:31.495]  I think next year is going to be a very tumultuous year.
[02:58:32.716 --> 02:58:34.136]  It's going to surprise a lot of people.
[02:58:34.156 --> 02:58:37.458]  It's going to bring a lot of people to our way of thinking.
[02:58:37.558 --> 02:58:38.078]  You're right.
[02:58:38.138 --> 02:58:38.679]  God bless you.
[02:58:38.759 --> 02:58:39.239]  Out of time.
[02:58:39.279 --> 02:58:39.939]  Great job, Cruz.
[02:58:39.959 --> 02:58:40.820]  See you all back Sunday.
[02:58:40.860 --> 02:58:42.981]  Tonight, Mike Adams, InfoWars Nightly News.
