[00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:07.432]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:09.133]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:10.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:12.434]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:14.175]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:18.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:23.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:45.689]  It is Friday, the 12th day of August 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.591]  We have our once a week Friday visit with Bob Chapman.
[00:00:48.611 --> 00:01:01.802]  We're going to have open phones throughout the full three hours of the broadcast, interspersed with a lot of really important news dealing with the economy, government-run health care, more information on Breivik, the Norway shooter.
[00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:05.064]  Ron Paul won the big straw poll in Iowa.
[00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:16.158]  On the heels of the debate last night, and everywhere across talk radio, mainline television news, there is the talking point that Ron Paul can't win.
[00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:23.929]  As they get more and more horrified that he's won in Iowa, in major polls, in straw polls, he's won in New Hampshire.
[00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:38.984]  And so they're just going to continue to say he cannot win, cannot win, cannot win, so that weak-minded people say, well, I'm going to get on the bandwagon with who can win, the guy that authored Obamacare in Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, or the man being called the savior.
[00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:40.947]  I saw that headline this morning.
[00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:50.078]  Rick Perry is going to save us and CBS News reported last night that he's told them he will be announcing tomorrow.
[00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:54.235]  Ladies and gentlemen, I live in Austin.
[00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:58.276]  I told you Rick Perry two years ago was going to run for president.
[00:01:59.016 --> 00:02:04.358]  I told you that his pledge was completely fake, that he would not run for the 2012 election.
[00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:07.579]  Remember, he pledged he would, and then he says he may break his pledge.
[00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.221]  He always intended to give a fake pledge to peak interest, to make him look like the reluctant hero.
[00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.362]  And so that doesn't make it breaking a pledge, which is bad enough.
[00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:17.783]  It makes him a liar.
[00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:21.044]  But I understand folks like to be conned by Obama.
[00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:24.604]  A lot of conservatives are going to want to get hurt real bad by Rick Perry.
[00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.485]  I understand.
[00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:28.085]  It's a national pastime to be gullible.
[00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:32.386]  So we're going to be going over that today as well.
[00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:42.868]  Also, I saw this news this morning on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com from the Gazette Virginian.
[00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:50.849]  It's also in the journal, the J Journal Interactive.
[00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.610]  Journal Sentinel.
[00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:57.592]  Farmers thrash idea of commercial licenses.
[00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:01.274]  Driving proposal treats tractors like big rigs.
[00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:02.595]  Oh, it'll do a lot more than that.
[00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:03.915]  I'm going to break down.
[00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:08.538]  I've got intel and I've seen the feds talking about it for all RVs.
[00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:12.400]  You're not going to just, during the depression, live in an RV.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.821]  You're going to pay a very high fee to do that.
[00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:24.906]  And they're going to pull you over, just like all the commercial trucks, with the truck police and harass the living daylights out of you, while the Mexican trucks are exempt from all the laws.
[00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:27.287]  You're not going to escape living on the street.
[00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.728]  You're not going to accept slavery.
[00:03:29.748 --> 00:03:31.909]  You're going to try to survive and live.
[00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.750]  Not going to happen.
[00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.292]  So I want to break down animal ID, premises ID.
[00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:44.685]  And I want to really show people the world that's coming because this is an America where you're not going to have a garden in your backyard.
[00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:50.170]  You're not going to have old grandpappy's tractor you still use to have your garden.
[00:03:51.002 --> 00:04:02.672]  And the cops are going to come on your property without warrants, and if your brakes aren't working perfectly, or the paint job isn't just right, or the spark plugs are old, or there's some mud on the flaps, they're going to give you a $1,000 fine.
[00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:04.693]  You know, that's what happens to trucks.
[00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:12.680]  They harass the living daylights out of them and suck giant amounts of revenue out of them with their mouths foaming.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.022]  It is pure highway robbery nationwide.
[00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:22.246]  I did special reports, I don't know, 15 years ago about the harassment of truck drivers here in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:30.608]  Not just long haulers, but the dump truck drivers, the cement truck drivers, the delivery truck drivers, people with commercial licenses.
[00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:36.630]  And that's all the Animal ID premises ID is, is a federal commercial license to even grow tomatoes.
[00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.852]  So it's just a bureaucratic way of doing what Joseph Stalin did in Ukraine, shutting off the infrastructure.
[00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:46.718]  Will Americans bend over to it?
[00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:56.541]  Will Americans have a fetish to follow illegal rules or will they tell the feds, you know what, we're not going to do what you say.
[00:04:57.082 --> 00:05:00.443]  It's time for the farmers to all get together and tell the cops to go to Hades.
[00:05:01.923 --> 00:05:06.165]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:10.547]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:11.267]  Number two,
[00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:16.231]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:17.012]  It's true.
[00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:21.877]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:22.737]  Number three.
[00:05:22.998 --> 00:05:26.301]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:30.324]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:31.065]  Number four.
[00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:33.687]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:37.411]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:42.435]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:42.656 --> 00:05:47.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.744]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.446]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:58.290]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:04.349]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.594]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:11.235]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:20.204]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:28.029]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:36.073]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:43.857]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.543]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.167]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:57.756]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:06.504]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:10.567]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:13.009]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:18.473]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:25.119]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:31.104]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:35.228]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:39.732]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:45.557]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:45.957 --> 00:07:48.940]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.942]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:51.923]  It's here.

[00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:07.149]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.790]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:24.813]  It is Friday, the 12th day of August 2011.
[00:08:25.053 --> 00:08:28.896]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:28.937 --> 00:08:31.098]  We're going to be live here again for the next three hours.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:43.610]  And I have to really control myself right now to not boil with abject, total anger and disgust by all of the news that I have here in front of me.
[00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.532]  The raids on Amish for selling cheese and
[00:08:47.273 --> 00:09:02.557]  Potatoes to their neighbors, the raids on stores selling raw milk and watermelons, the attacks across the board on people trying to grow gardens in their own front yards and backyards.
[00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:05.178]  We live in a giant prison.
[00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:09.219]  Regulations are passed to shut down the little guy.
[00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:12.020]  All the big guys are exempt.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.961]  It is a mafia system to shut down their competition.
[00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:23.275]  And I have several examples of this right here in front of me that I want to mention, then I'm going to get into all the other news and come back to it.
[00:09:23.776 --> 00:09:33.443]  Postal Service proposes cutting 1,020 jobs, pulling out of health care plan.
[00:09:35.064 --> 00:09:41.809]  Oh, and over 2,000 major corporations like McDonald's have been given White House exemptions from the health care law.
[00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.471]  They're exempt,
[00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:50.715]  But your business, my business, is not exempt.
[00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.337]  This is the nature of a mafia government.
[00:09:56.018 --> 00:10:12.347]  And when you look at what's happening with the animal ID, premises ID the feds have tried to force through on the already struggling and really almost extinct family farm and ranch,
[00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:29.067]  Or even truck farmer that's under all-out, just total assault by regulations, by bureaucrats, by harassers, by all of these federally controlled rural council goons.
[00:10:30.028 --> 00:10:31.829]  What does the Declaration of Independence talk about?
[00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:42.433]  He has created a multitude of offices and sent forth swarms of officers to eat out our substance.
[00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:46.572]  And that's what's happening.
[00:10:47.293 --> 00:11:07.082]  You know, when you look at the premises ID, animal ID, which again, people fought and hasn't been completely implemented, a small family farm with chickens is forced to buy five to $10 tags per chicken when you couldn't sell the chicken for $5 on average.
[00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:20.436]  But then Tyson Chicken and others, they are exempt and only have to have a tag per section of a giant building full of hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions, of
[00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:43.328]  Enslaved, drugged, zombie chickens where people that go into the chicken facilities, the chicken complexes, have to wear a mask in many cases because if any human germs get on them, they're all so debilitated and on so many drugs, they'll die.
[00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:45.349]  It's the same thing with many of the big pig farms now.
[00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:48.571]  So big Agra's got this nightmare
[00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:59.577]  science fiction gulag system going to produce chickens and pigs and things like that.
[00:11:59.597 --> 00:12:15.949]  And there's total harassment against the small family farms and ranches with bureaucratic red tape being spewed at them, being launched at them in a full-out complete and total assault.
[00:12:24.423 --> 00:12:25.064]  It's incredible.
[00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:35.852]  And the average city slicker, 91% of the population, has no idea what's happening in the rural communities.
[00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:39.095]  They are completely imploding across the country.
[00:12:39.135 --> 00:12:40.176]  They are ghost towns.
[00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:48.403]  And those that can hang on with family farms or ranches, almost all, work in town.
[00:12:50.111 --> 00:13:04.080]  For the highway department, or for the prison, or for the power plant, or at a fish, you know, bait shop, or at a gas station, or a restaurant, and then they come home at night and work on the farm and work on the weekends.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:20.085]  And the taxes are going up and the regulations and the IRS now, if you've got a hundred and something year old family hobby farm, they come in and they say, you can't have tax exemptions for a farm anymore if it's not profitable.
[00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:22.826]  We're going back five years now.
[00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:24.106]  You owe us all this money.
[00:13:24.627 --> 00:13:29.488]  And you say, but I just worked the farm to keep it and to pay the property tax.
[00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:30.969]  And they say, we don't care.
[00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.169]  You can't make it profitable.
[00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:34.430]  All your tax exemptions are gone.
[00:13:38.197 --> 00:13:54.489]  And it's a complete end of America, the end of the world's breadbasket, and a key part of the globalist operation to make us completely dependent on Big Agra, big business, big government.
[00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:01.695]  And as I mentioned, here's the Washington Post today, Postal Service proposing 120,000 people to be cut.
[00:14:05.816 --> 00:14:10.860]  Puzzle Service proposal cutting 120,000 jobs, pulling out of health care plan.
[00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:23.210]  And it goes on here to say that, well, they're going to get an exemption from Lord Obama.
[00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:26.628]  Because you can't compete, you see.
[00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:29.830]  If you're a private company, you're going to have to buy that health care.
[00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.433]  Unless you're one of the 2,000-plus special companies he's given a waiver to.
[00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:40.856]  And, of course, if you're the federal government, you're going to get a waiver from that as well.
[00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:45.319]  Because the Postal Service says they're going to go completely bankrupt if they have to.
[00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:47.500]  Well, that's the whole plan!
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.441]  For private businesses!
[00:14:50.802 --> 00:14:54.304]  You know, I hear Mainline Talk Radio starting to finally get it and saying,
[00:14:55.822 --> 00:14:58.604]  It's as if Obama wants to bankrupt America.
[00:14:59.304 --> 00:15:01.506]  It's as if he wants to end the free market system.
[00:15:01.966 --> 00:15:03.907]  Well, it's not Obama that wants that.
[00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:07.129]  Obama's a teleprompter reading puppet.
[00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:08.990]  A political prostitute.
[00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.292]  A bought and paid for individual.
[00:15:11.672 --> 00:15:13.613]  From his days of working for the Ford Foundation.
[00:15:14.734 --> 00:15:15.994]  And his mama who worked for him.
[00:15:16.035 --> 00:15:17.095]  Worked for Geithner's daddy.
[00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:21.218]  You know, the mainline neocons on radio.
[00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:23.259]  They want you to hate Obama and look at Obama.
[00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:24.500]  And I hate Obama.
[00:15:26.584 --> 00:15:41.611]  I mean, I would hate some mafia enforcer, low-level soldier, who was in the mafia in New York, if he came up to me and into my business and said, pay me protection money, I'd probably jump over the counter and take care of business.
[00:15:41.771 --> 00:15:42.652]  I just can't help it.
[00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:45.113]  Not because I'm tough, but because I'm not a slave.
[00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:49.695]  But I'd really hate who sent them.
[00:15:50.856 --> 00:15:52.377]  I'd really hate who they work for.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.563]  You see, if the Mafia did anything to my family, then I'd find out who their boss was, and I'd come after them.
[00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:04.726]  That's why in the South and in the West, the Mafia never did too good.
[00:16:06.146 --> 00:16:06.907]  Study your history.
[00:16:07.747 --> 00:16:09.248]  Because people wouldn't put up with it.
[00:16:10.748 --> 00:16:19.933]  Now, as immigrant populations came in from Eastern and Southern Europe, who were accustomed to living under the Mafia, Mafia did quite well and got a good toehold in.
[00:16:22.287 --> 00:16:35.057]  And see, under the federal government, somehow though, Americans, whether they be in the North, the South, the East, the West, the Midwest, they will roll over to federal mafia any day of the week.
[00:16:35.438 --> 00:16:36.719]  And they love it.
[00:16:37.725 --> 00:16:43.794]  You know, Americans think discrimination can only be on race, or sex, or religion.
[00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:53.808]  That's all child's play, and the feds promote an obsession with all of that, and a hypersensitivity to that, so you'll obsess over it and run to them to be the referee.
[00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:57.694]  So you'll come to the real organized crime for protection.
[00:16:57.734 --> 00:17:08.337]  But the real discrimination goes on all around you where the Fortune 500 pays almost no property tax in any county, city, or state they live in.
[00:17:09.037 --> 00:17:12.318]  In fact, many times they're actually paid to come to your area.
[00:17:13.719 --> 00:17:24.282]  But your company, your little operation, my little operation, I've gone and asked the city for tax cuts and exemption and they laughed at me three years ago.
[00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:28.071]  It was as if it was a ridiculous joke.
[00:17:29.012 --> 00:17:35.216]  A native Texan, a truly independent operation and company, an independent media operation.
[00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:39.359]  I am like rotten garbage to be dumped out.
[00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:40.260]  Rotten milk.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:47.165]  Same thing, we've approached YouTube and said, you know, our channels have hundreds and hundreds of millions of views.
[00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:48.966]  We'd like to be a partner channel.
[00:17:49.006 --> 00:17:51.108]  We'd like to be able to upload full-length videos.
[00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:53.083]  And they just laughed at us.
[00:17:53.883 --> 00:17:54.584]  And people complained.
[00:17:54.604 --> 00:17:58.807]  They say, why are these videos you produce for free for us broken up in parts?
[00:17:59.407 --> 00:18:02.009]  Well, we don't have a partner channel.
[00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:03.650]  We don't have a director channel.
[00:18:03.971 --> 00:18:10.856]  We set up another channel and by accident they gave it to us for a while and saw us putting it up and took it away from us.
[00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:18.158]  But that's okay, because the more they try to tilt the odds against us, the harder I'm going to dig in and I'm going to fight.
[00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:22.619]  And that's the spirit our farmers and ranchers and our small businesses need to have.
[00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:28.760]  And people need to support small businesses and independent radio stations and independent newspapers.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.521]  Not even if they're not 100% what you agree with.
[00:18:33.221 --> 00:18:36.682]  We better support local and we better do it now.
[00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:45.804]  Now I've got all this world news, I've got all this military news that I'm going to cover here.
[00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:57.286]  I'm going to cover it.
[00:18:57.747 --> 00:19:04.728]  When I come back, I'm going to get into these mainstream news articles reporting on the fact that they're going to force
[00:19:07.606 --> 00:19:21.035]  Anyone driving even the smallest tractor or four-wheeler or anything involved in farm work with a federal commercial vehicle operator's license.
[00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:22.977]  Now, do you have any idea what this means?
[00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:28.340]  This is a federal jurisdictional power grab onto private property.
[00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:30.442]  A, it's totally unconstitutional.
[00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:34.578]  B, it's about coming on your property without warrants.
[00:19:34.658 --> 00:19:39.480]  It's about turning the truck police loose on the rural communities.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.641]  And you have no idea how hard they're going to hit you.
[00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:45.102]  These are the most wicked police I've ever run into.
[00:19:45.642 --> 00:19:47.103]  They are pure highway robbers.
[00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:53.586]  And it's about taxing the living daylights out of you.
[00:19:54.866 --> 00:19:56.747]  And they're going to declare most of your equipment
[00:19:57.786 --> 00:19:59.093]  Useless that you've kept running.
[00:19:59.556 --> 00:20:00.220]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:00.863]  I'll explain it all.
[00:20:02.173 --> 00:20:04.475]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.536]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:40.552]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:41.333]  This capitalism?
[00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:47.537]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:48.478]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:51.620]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.560]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.641]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:22:01.506 --> 00:22:05.529]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:07.190]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:15.915]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:22:16.355 --> 00:22:19.517]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:22:19.777 --> 00:22:20.658]  But take heart.
[00:22:20.678 --> 00:22:24.340]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.623]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:22:30.023 --> 00:22:33.566]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:22:33.866 --> 00:22:35.307]  The globalists are scared.
[00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:36.588]  They've overreached.
[00:22:36.928 --> 00:22:40.050]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.452]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:22:58.083 --> 00:23:00.951]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear!

[00:23:31.011 --> 00:23:32.072]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:32.252 --> 00:23:36.635]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:42.539]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:46.041]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:48.883]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:48.983 --> 00:23:53.906]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:24:02.493 --> 00:24:04.715]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:05.256 --> 00:24:08.039]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:35.431]  You want to know what's wrong with America?
[00:24:37.152 --> 00:24:48.060]  We have multinational corporations, predominantly the Fortune 100, but a lot of the Fortune 500 are involved as well, who write the laws.
[00:24:48.641 --> 00:24:50.422]  I mean, it's public fact.
[00:24:50.462 --> 00:24:55.586]  It was all over even mainstream news last November that Big Agra wrote the Food Safety Act.
[00:24:56.447 --> 00:25:01.230]  Didn't matter it was Big Agra that caused the two or three big health scares.
[00:25:02.225 --> 00:25:03.745]  That happened last year.
[00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:11.668]  Didn't matter if it was big, giant industrial production facilities that put out the Salmonella and that put out the E. coli.
[00:25:13.028 --> 00:25:15.889]  Didn't matter if it turned out it was the same groups in Germany.
[00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:21.591]  They write the laws every time they screw up to shut down their competition.
[00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:27.773]  And it's the same in every single field of this country.
[00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:31.574]  The big guys shutting down the little guys.
[00:25:33.542 --> 00:25:36.225]  And the railroads tried to do it when they expanded west.
[00:25:38.128 --> 00:25:46.158]  In fact, we had our war with Britain over gun control, but also over laws meant to shut down the little guys in commerce and in farming.
[00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:50.283]  The Civil War really started over that, not over slavery.
[00:25:51.343 --> 00:25:59.288]  You go back and look at the North putting all sorts of regulations on the South that was predominantly agricultural, but exempting themselves in the North.
[00:25:59.908 --> 00:26:05.632]  This is always the issue, is economic discrimination by the insiders.
[00:26:06.392 --> 00:26:11.856]  America was founded against these types of unfair trade advantages.
[00:26:13.388 --> 00:26:16.651]  And everybody's looking for racism against blacks or whites.
[00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:22.716]  People are looking for discrimination on what sexual preference they have.
[00:26:23.156 --> 00:26:30.523]  While meanwhile, the real discrimination is going on against the little guy, no matter what color you are.
[00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:36.007]  Now, let me go ahead and get to this article right here.
[00:26:37.769 --> 00:26:40.371]  One of these is out of the Virginia Gazette.
[00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:46.078]  The other is out of the journal Sentinel, and it says a new rule.
[00:26:46.218 --> 00:26:47.519]  Not a law, but a rule!
[00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:55.525]  There's not a law that the TSA could stick their hands down your pants and be on the streets of America now, but there's a rule!
[00:26:55.605 --> 00:26:56.786]  They made a rule!
[00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:06.753]  A new rule being proposed by the Federal Department of Transportation would require farmers to get commercial driver's licenses.
[00:27:06.773 --> 00:27:10.496]  See, and nowhere do they point out in these articles the big issues here.
[00:27:12.478 --> 00:27:19.083]  Since when does the federal government have control of our transportation within the states?
[00:27:19.563 --> 00:27:21.484]  Since when do they get to set the speed limit?
[00:27:22.005 --> 00:27:23.566]  Or what color the road signs are?
[00:27:25.847 --> 00:27:32.092]  Oh, some federal money comes in that was taken from the state to begin with, but now, now
[00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:53.859]  They're going to empower under federal rules, and the states are all going to get behind this, to turn loose the county and city and state truck police to pull up at your farm or ranch and to come up and white glove inspect your farm equipment.
[00:27:55.578 --> 00:28:03.621]  And if you don't know what they do to truck drivers, aggregate haulers, furniture store drivers, they don't care.
[00:28:04.301 --> 00:28:10.103]  Long haulers, the people that keep this country running, who have really got super hard hellish jobs in my opinion.
[00:28:13.485 --> 00:28:22.408]  If they are able to get away with this, it is another serious blow to this country.
[00:28:24.179 --> 00:28:33.561]  And a giant federal power grab over every rural community in this country.
[00:28:34.002 --> 00:28:50.686]  Now the feds say they're going to make a rule, not a law, a rule that they have jurisdiction on your farm, your ranch, and that you are going to have to pay
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.082]  To take the classes and the yearly fines and the fees to get your commercial license.
[00:28:57.583 --> 00:29:06.807]  And they sell it in this particular article out of the Gazette, the Virginian Gazette, that, oh, well, it's just some small little fees.
[00:29:07.867 --> 00:29:08.928]  It's no big deal.
[00:29:09.028 --> 00:29:09.488]  Oh, really?
[00:29:09.968 --> 00:29:13.910]  Under the regulations that the feds have, do you have any idea
[00:29:16.687 --> 00:29:17.728]  The type of harassment.
[00:29:18.148 --> 00:29:22.392]  What is white glove inspection at West Point and other military academies?
[00:29:23.753 --> 00:29:30.619]  They come in wearing white gloves into your barracks and they go around the light bulbs and they go under the beds and the floor.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.763]  If they can find any dirt on that white glove, you get a demerit.
[00:29:35.953 --> 00:29:41.456]  And so you've got to go basically run laps or get extra duties.
[00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:43.938]  Well, in this case, you get fines and fees.
[00:29:44.558 --> 00:29:46.139]  So they're going to come up to your old tractor.
[00:29:46.939 --> 00:29:48.901]  Well, let me tell you about the rest of it when we get back.
[00:29:52.163 --> 00:29:53.063]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.563 --> 00:29:55.164]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.105 --> 00:29:58.766]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.256 --> 00:30:05.278]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:09.962]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[00:30:10.202 --> 00:30:18.688]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[00:30:18.888 --> 00:30:26.554]  For a limited time, you get 30% off a one-year Freedom Supply, which provides three hearty meals per day for one adult.
[00:30:26.714 --> 00:30:28.515]  The Freedom Supply includes a large variety
[00:30:28.575 --> 00:30:29.495]  We're good to go!
[00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:53.341]  Now is the time.
[00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:55.022]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:55.722 --> 00:31:01.124]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:02.224 --> 00:31:07.666]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:13.628]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:20.211]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset cheese.
[00:31:22.745 --> 00:31:24.891]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:26.817 --> 00:31:29.124]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:31:31.107 --> 00:31:35.090]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:38.953]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:31:39.654 --> 00:31:40.475]  Others don't.
[00:31:40.895 --> 00:31:42.776]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:43.037 --> 00:31:44.538]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:44.818 --> 00:31:47.380]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.965]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:56.528]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:59.070]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:31:59.410 --> 00:31:59.910]  Others don't.
[00:32:02.822 --> 00:32:07.107]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:32:07.507 --> 00:32:13.374]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:32:13.954 --> 00:32:15.696]  Number one, study the past.
[00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:17.979]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:22.343]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:32:23.467 --> 00:32:25.729]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:29.832]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:32:30.392 --> 00:32:35.115]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:32:35.436 --> 00:32:38.878]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:32:39.438 --> 00:32:42.300]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:46.503]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:47.324 --> 00:32:51.585]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:56.387]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:56.887 --> 00:32:59.048]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:33:25.517 --> 00:33:41.841]  If you'd like to discuss the riots in London, the police stand down, now the calls to censor free speech for everyone because of it, or the global financial meltdown that is continuing, it is a planned consolidation.
[00:33:42.281 --> 00:33:48.383]  After every bailout of the megabanks, things will only get worse because it's a planned takeover program.
[00:33:49.335 --> 00:33:50.456]  In their own admissions.
[00:33:50.476 --> 00:33:53.119]  If you'd like to talk about that, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:34:01.347]  If you think it's wrong that the Postal Service is going to be exempt from getting their employees healthcare but your business isn't, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:34:01.988 --> 00:34:05.312]  Or what about the big hoax that I see ongoing?
[00:34:05.832 --> 00:34:07.974]  They did it three and a half years ago, they're doing it again.
[00:34:09.055 --> 00:34:10.776]  I heard it on local talk radio this morning.
[00:34:11.256 --> 00:34:16.419]  Yeah, Ron Paul's winning the straw polls and scientific polls in New Hampshire and Iowa.
[00:34:16.479 --> 00:34:26.084]  Normally the news would say, that's the frontrunner, he's probably going to win, he would be catapulted into the absolute national lead, and Ron Paul would end up being the president.
[00:34:27.082 --> 00:34:32.965]  But the system has put out the talking point that all the little minions and compartmentalized people parrot.
[00:34:33.145 --> 00:34:34.666]  They're not even government agents.
[00:34:34.986 --> 00:34:41.489]  They just go with the flow and they're saying Ron Paul can't win, Ron Paul can't win, Ron Paul can't win, Ron Paul can't win.
[00:34:41.849 --> 00:34:45.571]  The American people want somebody with better looking hair like Rick Perry or Mitt Romney.
[00:34:47.612 --> 00:34:51.014]  Both of them literal Democratic operatives in the flesh.
[00:34:52.783 --> 00:34:55.944]  Oh, you didn't know Mitt Romney wrote the health care bill that was the model for Obama?
[00:34:56.665 --> 00:34:58.645]  You didn't know he supports global carbon taxes?
[00:34:58.665 --> 00:35:01.026]  You didn't know Newt Gingrich supports global carbon taxes?
[00:35:01.446 --> 00:35:07.029]  And wrote the foreword to Alvin and Heidi Toffler's, two of their books, Calling for World Government.
[00:35:07.249 --> 00:35:08.229]  I've read the quotes here.
[00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.371]  Calling for world government?
[00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.972]  And the end of national sovereignty?
[00:35:15.232 --> 00:35:18.833]  Just like the former editor of Newsweek, Strobe Talbot, who then went to work for Clinton?
[00:35:18.853 --> 00:35:20.094]  I mean, they're all the same scum!
[00:35:21.832 --> 00:35:27.179]  Or, oh, you're thinking, well, Rick Perry, Al Gore's former campaign chairman in Texas for president.
[00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:28.140]  You mean him.
[00:35:29.665 --> 00:35:34.247]  Oh, you mean, um... By the way, I always get emails and comments going, I thought you were a liar.
[00:35:34.668 --> 00:35:36.208]  I went and looked that up about Rick Perry.
[00:35:36.228 --> 00:35:37.149]  Why haven't I heard that?
[00:35:37.549 --> 00:35:44.652]  You think I'm gonna get up here and tell you he was the campaign chairman for Al Gore in his first presidential run when he was a senator in 1988?
[00:35:45.413 --> 00:35:49.455]  You think I'm gonna get up here on the radio and lie to you consciously?
[00:35:49.735 --> 00:35:53.457]  I make little mistakes sometimes, but I'm not gonna make a mistake about something like that.
[00:35:57.975 --> 00:36:04.458]  I told you Rick Perry, well I actually told you three and a half years ago it's an endgame, was going to run for president in the 2012 election.
[00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:08.840]  I told you two years ago he was going to claim he wasn't going to run and going to run.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:16.504]  I told you when he made the pledge six months ago to not run in 2012.
[00:36:17.044 --> 00:36:18.385]  I said he's going to break that pledge.
[00:36:18.565 --> 00:36:19.686]  He plans to break it.
[00:36:19.926 --> 00:36:25.889]  He's piquing your interest that he's the hero who is reluctant
[00:36:27.267 --> 00:36:29.028]  And he's going to break that pledge tomorrow.
[00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:44.255]  You know, if you go with the opposite of whatever the establishment media and government says, you'll do pretty good.
[00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.576]  But I don't just go with whatever the opposite of what they say.
[00:36:47.856 --> 00:36:48.637]  That's a good rule.
[00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:52.983]  I mean if you're going in the dark and they say go left, you go right.
[00:36:53.003 --> 00:36:54.423]  They say go up, you go down.
[00:36:54.663 --> 00:36:56.423]  They say zig, you zag.
[00:36:56.643 --> 00:36:57.704]  But I don't go off that.
[00:36:59.764 --> 00:37:04.585]  If I've got a split second decision to make, I automatically don't believe them and it always holds me in good stead.
[00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:09.686]  Because he's a congenital psychopath with an army of sociopaths that work for him.
[00:37:12.007 --> 00:37:15.987]  Social engineers that have lulled the general public into a deep trance.
[00:37:17.228 --> 00:37:18.748]  And so now they can get away with anything.
[00:37:22.358 --> 00:37:24.039]  Unless we wake people up out of their trance.
[00:37:25.419 --> 00:37:26.319]  But I'm going to be going over that.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.341]  Ron Paul has won a big straw poll.
[00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:32.102]  ABC News is reporting.
[00:37:33.582 --> 00:37:35.443]  Ron Paul won with 44%.
[00:37:36.023 --> 00:37:37.584]  A super whopping victory.
[00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:43.286]  Kind of like he had the second largest margin of victory in CPAC history this year.
[00:37:43.926 --> 00:37:48.868]  And Fox News dubbed booing over him being announced the winner.
[00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:54.070]  And you're like, oh, well, Fox News is, they tried to lie to me, but that's okay.
[00:37:55.131 --> 00:37:56.111]  I like to be lied to.
[00:37:56.171 --> 00:37:59.812]  It's fun to have them try to manipulate me like I'm a monkey or something.
[00:38:01.673 --> 00:38:04.714]  It's kind of cute to be conned and have somebody run over you.
[00:38:04.934 --> 00:38:12.157]  You know, a normal red-blooded man gets upset by con artists, gets upset by criminals, gets upset by bullies.
[00:38:12.677 --> 00:38:17.819]  Because if you don't have that instinct, your family, your tribe, your people have no future.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:28.408]  America had the most red-blooded, most aggressive people who demanded the maximum level of liberty, so we got the maximum level of prosperity.
[00:38:29.228 --> 00:38:46.102]  But notice, as we get rid of our anti-establishment, untrustful attitude towards government, as we stopped being aggressive, suddenly, all of our prosperity is burning up in front of our eyes.
[00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:53.263]  And the system's come out in the last three months, in Newsweek, Time, and every other major publication I've looked at.
[00:38:53.543 --> 00:38:56.865]  I've walked into newsstands and just seen it every tenth magazine.
[00:38:56.885 --> 00:38:57.665]  It's just everywhere.
[00:38:57.685 --> 00:39:00.606]  In the political section, it's every other headline.
[00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:02.287]  The Constitution's the problem.
[00:39:02.587 --> 00:39:04.348]  Get rid of it and you'll have prosperity.
[00:39:04.628 --> 00:39:05.148]  And you know what?
[00:39:05.388 --> 00:39:11.030]  The general public, a lot of them, are going to come and say, get rid of the Constitution, get rid of due process, do whatever the government says.
[00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:12.851]  They promise to bring it back.
[00:39:13.071 --> 00:39:15.692]  Yeah, like each banker bailout, they promise to give you.
[00:39:17.802 --> 00:39:22.145]  Each banker bailout, they promise everything's going to be fixed right after you give us more power.
[00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:26.549]  And then you do it and then things get worse.
[00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:42.601]  And now they've got a star chamber committee of 13 up there who has created a new branch of government and there isn't a big uproar because we've already been trained how to be slaves.
[00:39:43.042 --> 00:39:46.585]  We've already put up with wars without congressional approval and wireless
[00:39:48.308 --> 00:39:49.688]  Warrantless wiretapping.
[00:39:52.429 --> 00:39:59.731]  We've already put up with the government with a straight face saying, yeah, we ordered the torture of people, including children, in front of their parents, Washington Post.
[00:40:01.572 --> 00:40:08.814]  And then I was on the phone yesterday with an establishment writer from Slate, and that's why I refuse most interviews now with these people.
[00:40:09.154 --> 00:40:16.656]  Not because I can't intellectually deal with an argument with them, but I just don't have time for children.
[00:40:17.662 --> 00:40:26.825]  For children, when classical tyranny is pouring in all around us, the water is rising, and they're looking at you telling you everything's fine.
[00:40:28.506 --> 00:40:31.247]  They think it's a virtue to deny that we're in trouble.
[00:40:33.087 --> 00:40:35.768]  They think, like children, they control reality.
[00:40:36.068 --> 00:40:37.088]  They have magical thinking.
[00:40:37.809 --> 00:40:41.390]  That's why Oprah Winfrey pushing that stupid idea of the secret was so popular.
[00:40:42.705 --> 00:40:44.626]  Where you just imagine something and it happens.
[00:40:44.706 --> 00:40:44.926]  No.
[00:40:45.466 --> 00:40:51.609]  If you imagine it, and it's feasible, and you work on it, you may be able to manifest it.
[00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:53.930]  But it doesn't magically happen.
[00:40:55.571 --> 00:41:01.594]  Like you throw some dust in a fire and there's a blue puff of smoke and an Easter Bunny appears.
[00:41:02.054 --> 00:41:03.135]  That doesn't work.
[00:41:04.468 --> 00:41:09.152]  And so people just think, well, I choose to not believe that things are this bad.
[00:41:09.292 --> 00:41:16.118]  I choose to believe we're not going into a depression, and that somehow that'll make it not be a depression.
[00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:19.100]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:19.200]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.142]  And we don't screen your calls, but I do
[00:41:28.743 --> 00:41:33.185]  Not like getting the whole show caught up in people just plugging stuff, because we don't screen your calls.
[00:41:33.225 --> 00:41:46.092]  So, you've got to talk about one of these issues first, then you can throw a plug in at the end, or I may just hang up on you, because I want the good callers that really have points to make to be able to get involved on air.
[00:41:46.112 --> 00:41:48.473]  800-259-9231, here on this live Friday edition.
[00:41:50.955 --> 00:41:52.996]  I tell you, the show's a lot better when I screen calls.
[00:41:54.494 --> 00:42:10.703]  Every once in a while we'll say, only military callers, only police callers, only firefighters, only farmers, you know, on a particular issue, only organic food farmers, only radio broadcasters, you know, to really get... only people from England who've witnessed the riots.
[00:42:11.084 --> 00:42:12.905]  And there are incredible calls every one of them!
[00:42:13.817 --> 00:42:24.664]  But when I just opened the phones up, the people who were sitting there on Prozac or whatever, laying back on their backs, kind of get up out of the bed, wipe the crust out of their eyes, and call in and jam the phones up.
[00:42:25.264 --> 00:42:28.646]  So, I'm changing the way this show runs.
[00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:34.950]  I'm not going to screen your calls, but if you sound like you are drunk, you are not going to be on the air.
[00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:35.010]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:40.578 --> 00:42:41.659]  But I've been watching this.
[00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:48.246]  Ron Paul, we need to do a breakdown of it, has won around two-thirds of the straw polls in the last few months.
[00:42:49.468 --> 00:42:53.632]  And he won a whopping 44% of the unique voters.
[00:42:54.013 --> 00:42:55.174]  Herman Cain, 16.
[00:42:55.214 --> 00:42:56.215]  Michelle Bachman, 10.
[00:42:56.295 --> 00:42:56.595]  Perry, 8.
[00:42:58.749 --> 00:43:00.611]  Pawlenty and Mitt Romney, 5%.
[00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:02.272]  Sarah Palin, 4%.
[00:43:03.313 --> 00:43:04.414]  Someone else, 3%.
[00:43:04.474 --> 00:43:05.434]  Rick Santorum, 2%.
[00:43:05.955 --> 00:43:16.083]  But if you watch the news, you're told it's Rick Perry and the other Democratic operative, Mitt Romney.
[00:43:22.703 --> 00:43:25.369]  And again, he's being hailed as our only hope.
[00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:30.380]  And yeah, I guess Al Gore's former Chief of Staff in Texas is our only hope.
[00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:31.482]  Okay.
[00:43:33.095 --> 00:43:34.495]  And he is actually from Texas.
[00:43:35.236 --> 00:43:39.897]  Folks around the country, for whatever reason, have kind of a romantic love affair with Texans.
[00:43:39.937 --> 00:43:43.037]  Most of your big newscasters, for some reason, end up being from Texas.
[00:43:43.077 --> 00:43:43.698]  I don't know why.
[00:43:44.578 --> 00:43:47.618]  But I guess he really wasn't born in Kennebunkport, Maine.
[00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:49.139]  Not bashing folks in Maine.
[00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:49.759]  They're great people.
[00:43:50.799 --> 00:43:53.000]  But I guess he's a Texan.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.260]  I guess there's something real about him.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.640]  That's about it.
[00:43:57.681 --> 00:43:58.381]  That's about it.
[00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:05.110]  And, you know what?
[00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:06.471]  I'll be now called a communist.
[00:44:07.031 --> 00:44:11.434]  In fact, I've already been called a communist by the Dallas Blog and others for not liking Rick Perry.
[00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:18.499]  I was called a right-wing hate-monger for not liking Obama, and now I've got to get ready to be called a commie again.
[00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:24.823]  When I didn't like Clinton because he was a globalist operative, I was a right-wing extremist.
[00:44:24.883 --> 00:44:28.606]  And then Bush was in and continued the globalist agenda, and I was a communist.
[00:44:29.486 --> 00:44:31.708]  And now Obama's been in, and I've been an extreme right-winger.
[00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:35.344]  And now I've got to get ready to be a commie again.
[00:44:35.504 --> 00:44:36.926]  I thought I was a constitutionalist.
[00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:37.907]  I thought I was a realist.
[00:44:38.207 --> 00:44:46.376]  I thought I was somebody who actually studied reality and was into being informed and being a steward of my community and my family and trying to be a decent person.
[00:44:46.797 --> 00:44:48.379]  I thought, I thought that.
[00:44:48.459 --> 00:44:48.799]  But see...
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.621]  Well, they're stereotypical labels, so I've got to get ready for that.
[00:44:53.141 --> 00:44:55.101]  The good news is people aren't buying this anymore.
[00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:58.542]  But I'll get back to what really has me beside myself with anger.
[00:44:58.802 --> 00:44:59.902]  Because I knew it was coming.
[00:44:59.942 --> 00:45:03.343]  I'd seen the Department of Transportation talking about this two years ago.
[00:45:04.543 --> 00:45:06.583]  Now they've started the public comment period.
[00:45:10.704 --> 00:45:13.565]  And they're saying, don't worry.
[00:45:17.742 --> 00:45:27.829]  The Department of Transportation is looking at reclassifying farm vehicles and implements, and implements, that's your shredder, as commercial vehicles, and implements.
[00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.553]  I went into the federal website this morning at about 6.30am and couldn't believe it when I read the actual document.
[00:45:35.314 --> 00:45:38.777]  You can go comment on it, they can care less what you say, but you can comment on it.
[00:45:39.077 --> 00:45:42.900]  Maybe you can decide what color scarf to wear over your eyes in the firing squad.
[00:45:45.236 --> 00:45:46.657]  Or you can have some last words.
[00:45:46.997 --> 00:45:49.038]  You can have a cigarette, maybe, if you ask.
[00:45:49.478 --> 00:45:50.098]  If you're nice.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.620]  It's the little things that count.
[00:45:55.301 --> 00:46:09.568]  The proposed rule change would mean that anyone who drives a tractor or operates any piece of motorized farming equipment would be required to pass the same test to complete the same detailed forms and logs every mile you drive.
[00:46:09.768 --> 00:46:10.408]  Oh, yeah.
[00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:13.510]  When you went to sleep at night, we're going to learn you good.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.883]  Required of semi-tractor trailer drivers.
[00:46:17.463 --> 00:46:21.207]  Drivers would keep logs of information including hours worked and miles traveled.
[00:46:21.588 --> 00:46:26.773]  Vehicles would be required to display DOT numbers, CDL in Virginia.
[00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:33.656]  Cost $64 for 8 years and $8 per year, not including the cost of instructional class and written test.
[00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.238]  Yeah, I looked it up.
[00:46:35.418 --> 00:46:38.261]  It's hundreds of dollars a year in Texas.
[00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:41.564]  And then under this federal situation, there's even more rules.
[00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:43.305]  But that's not the issue.
[00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:46.228]  It's the logs and it's the inspections.
[00:46:46.788 --> 00:46:48.430]  And they're going to come on your property.
[00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.492]  And if your brakes are worn down on that old tractor,
[00:46:52.618 --> 00:46:57.361]  Or you haven't changed your spark plugs, they're going to hit you with fines that make your head spin.
[00:46:57.662 --> 00:47:03.265]  They go and actually, white glove, with a glove in Austin, dirt on the back bumper.
[00:47:03.726 --> 00:47:07.188]  And I drove by and almost wanted to pull over and videotape it just a few days ago.
[00:47:07.528 --> 00:47:09.509]  I see them out here on 290 every day.
[00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.812]  The truck police, as they're called by the truck drivers.
[00:47:13.232 --> 00:47:15.834]  And they pull over brand new looking trucks, you name it.
[00:47:16.394 --> 00:47:18.755]  And they're sitting there looking at those brakes.
[00:47:19.015 --> 00:47:22.816]  They're wiping for dirt and they're hitting them with $500,000 fines.
[00:47:25.577 --> 00:47:26.678]  It is incredible.
[00:47:26.838 --> 00:47:28.399]  You're like, oh, it's for our safety.
[00:47:28.419 --> 00:47:29.539]  Well, let me explain something.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:40.263]  I witnessed my grandfather taking pieces of Coke cans and rubber bands and rigging combines to work and operate.
[00:47:41.744 --> 00:47:53.511]  I, I, it is a culture of people bragging, at least where my family's from in East Texas, to say, take a look at this tractor and open it up and show how they custom rigged some 50 year old thing to work great.
[00:47:53.991 --> 00:47:55.192]  That's the only way they're in business.
[00:47:55.412 --> 00:47:57.553]  They can't go buy those big giant new tractors.
[00:47:58.073 --> 00:47:59.134]  They can't go into debt.
[00:48:00.285 --> 00:48:13.016]  We've got a 40-year-old tractor still working on our ranch out in East Texas, and it runs better than the South Korean piece of junk that my uncle bought 10 years ago.
[00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:17.060]  That thing was breaking down the first year we got it.
[00:48:19.442 --> 00:48:23.846]  But not the 40-year-old tractor that I rode around with my grandfather.
[00:48:24.881 --> 00:48:27.483]  And it's got like a 30-something-year-old shredder on the back of it.
[00:48:28.104 --> 00:48:29.365]  And it keeps it going.
[00:48:29.725 --> 00:48:30.406]  And you know what?
[00:48:30.806 --> 00:48:35.109]  The feds are going to come in there and they're going to say, that thing is out of business.
[00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:37.251]  Where are your logs?
[00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:38.172]  I want to see them.
[00:48:38.652 --> 00:48:42.335]  Federal jurisdiction over your farm, your ranch.
[00:48:43.456 --> 00:48:46.759]  You know, they started all this tyranny back in the 20s and 30s.
[00:48:46.779 --> 00:48:51.443]  They went to the dumbed-down public and they said, you're paying for these roads.
[00:48:52.699 --> 00:48:54.560]  And the trucks are heavier than your car.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.920]  They're making a little money.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.541]  Let's charge them more for the roads.
[00:49:00.262 --> 00:49:01.602]  Let's make them get a license.
[00:49:02.082 --> 00:49:03.103]  And that's how it started.
[00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:07.164]  And it wasn't until the 50s that most states had a driver's license for citizens.
[00:49:10.305 --> 00:49:11.465]  And now they're expanding.
[00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:12.666]  Oh, and let me tell you what's coming next.
[00:49:12.686 --> 00:49:19.128]  They're going to make anybody with an RV or pulling a trailer get a commercial license.
[00:49:23.636 --> 00:49:25.158]  And they talk about it in here.
[00:49:25.218 --> 00:49:32.244]  They're going to come on your property, and they're going to go back there to that heirloom tractor that you keep running because you love it.
[00:49:34.086 --> 00:49:39.731]  And they're going to look at its brakes, and they're going to look at its spark plugs, and they're going to look at its pistons.
[00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:43.795]  They're going to look at that old popper you got out back, that single cylinder.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:49.902]  And, oh, by the way, they're saying you're going to be under... Oh, the big one, I forgot the biggest point here.
[00:49:50.503 --> 00:49:57.486]  They say they also want to do this to make you go under the new clean air carbon tax.
[00:49:58.147 --> 00:50:01.949]  See, because they've cleaned up all these vehicles, except the old ones.
[00:50:02.729 --> 00:50:08.032]  And now the new ones, no matter how clean they are, oh, well, now we're going to tax you for carbon dioxide coming out the tailpipe.
[00:50:08.052 --> 00:50:10.033]  That's why they've listed it as a toxic waste.
[00:50:12.608 --> 00:50:13.589]  Same thing with the power plants.
[00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:14.389]  That's all that's coming out.
[00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:15.690]  Water, vapor, carbon dioxide.
[00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:17.171]  They've got sensors on them.
[00:50:17.791 --> 00:50:19.172]  Beds have got aircraft flying over.
[00:50:19.212 --> 00:50:20.093]  Cessna's snooping.
[00:50:21.073 --> 00:50:23.034]  GE can dump out whatever they want.
[00:50:23.074 --> 00:50:23.655]  Build new stuff.
[00:50:23.695 --> 00:50:24.155]  They're exempt.
[00:50:24.175 --> 00:50:25.376]  But everybody else, you're shut down.
[00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:26.617]  Which is great.
[00:50:26.697 --> 00:50:28.178]  GE's gonna charge you more.
[00:50:28.198 --> 00:50:31.880]  Doesn't matter if you have power interruptions, which we're now having more and more.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:36.122]  You're gonna learn to live like they do in Romania or Venezuela.
[00:50:36.983 --> 00:50:38.364]  You're gonna pay more for less.
[00:50:38.964 --> 00:50:41.666]  It's the insider mafia model.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:54.428]  And see, they're going to come in there now and say, oh, sorry, this tractor, this combine doesn't pass our regulations.
[00:50:54.708 --> 00:50:55.768]  You can't use it.
[00:50:56.689 --> 00:51:01.012]  And if you get uppity with those cops, they're going to call a rural affairs SWAT team to murder you.
[00:51:01.352 --> 00:51:01.913]  They want to.
[00:51:03.502 --> 00:51:05.024]  Hey Bill, pick up line 3, it's Brian.
[00:51:05.344 --> 00:51:05.985]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[00:51:07.006 --> 00:51:07.266]  Thanks.
[00:51:07.746 --> 00:51:12.872]  Hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the Safety Net, our full-year emergency food system.
[00:51:13.172 --> 00:51:21.080]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore, especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:31.027]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings, but the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal.
[00:51:31.327 --> 00:51:33.949]  It's truly great tasting food at amazing prices.
[00:51:34.209 --> 00:51:36.591]  The variety is also a huge bonus bill.
[00:51:36.731 --> 00:51:40.013]  It's like having access to a full menu of impressive food.
[00:51:40.093 --> 00:51:45.477]  Well, it really is a safety net for those worried about the coming food shortages and how their families can prepare.
[00:51:45.797 --> 00:51:49.984]  It's great knowing I'm covered for the future, but I gotta go, Bill, and get all this food unloaded.
[00:51:50.184 --> 00:51:52.267]  With scorching heat devastating U.S.

[00:53:51.653 --> 00:53:55.155]  Well, the unions are big businessmen, and they're going out like dinosaurs.
[00:54:13.528 --> 00:54:34.344]  I can see the day coming when even having your own garden is going to be against the law.
[00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:39.849]  They've done that in North Korea from time to time, not always.
[00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:41.310]  Russia's done it.
[00:54:43.902 --> 00:54:45.363]  Communists normally do that.
[00:54:48.384 --> 00:54:50.405]  Here's the best part of the Bob Dylan song right here.
[00:54:51.026 --> 00:54:51.466]  Crank it up.
[00:54:53.967 --> 00:55:00.291]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:55:00.311 --> 00:55:00.711]  Yeah.
[00:55:14.338 --> 00:55:16.405]  That's a lot of territory indeed.
[00:55:16.426 --> 00:55:19.677]  And a man's gonna do what a man's gotta do.
[00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:25.888]  But I guess that's better left unsaid.
[00:55:26.408 --> 00:55:27.789]  Man, I tell you, what a visionary.
[00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.809]  Bob Dylan.
[00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:33.792]  I've talked to a couple famous people that know Bob Dylan, and they've told me he's fully aware of the whole New World Order.
[00:55:33.832 --> 00:55:36.694]  I've got it from two different sources, and I'll just leave it at that.
[00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:40.436]  He's handing people anti-globalist books and stuff.
[00:55:41.636 --> 00:55:44.138]  Definitely has a very deep understanding of things.
[00:55:44.838 --> 00:55:49.862]  And if you're listening out there, Bob, we've never contacted you, but if you ever want to come on the radio, we'd love to hear from you.
[00:55:49.882 --> 00:55:53.645]  We know you're pretty reclusive as well, so I think there's not a very good chance of that.
[00:55:54.005 --> 00:55:59.009]  But who would have ever thought that we would have been contacted by some of the other folks that have contacted us?
[00:55:59.369 --> 00:56:03.732]  The problem is, is that usually they don't want to come on air.
[00:56:05.473 --> 00:56:06.574]  Same thing with Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:56:08.155 --> 00:56:10.757]  Just wanted to let us know he appreciated the show and what we were doing.
[00:56:11.741 --> 00:56:19.989]  He was about to retire, never be seen again, giving his last speech in a month, he told us, going on to some university, his alma mater.
[00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.333]  And then he went and gave a speech and a few months later fell down, hit his head and was dead.
[00:56:25.354 --> 00:56:28.497]  But I do have that little painting Kurt Vonnegut sent me.
[00:56:29.518 --> 00:56:32.721]  It's a bird cage with a bird flying out of it.
[00:56:34.278 --> 00:56:36.619]  The symbol of Libertad, the French Revolution.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:41.542]  It's a birdcage with the door open, with a birdie flying out.
[00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:43.663]  I got a coffee cup like that.
[00:56:43.703 --> 00:56:46.765]  I was at a restaurant, they were selling coffee cups, and I saw one and bought it.
[00:56:47.405 --> 00:56:48.445]  My favorite coffee cup.
[00:56:48.465 --> 00:56:49.646]  You know, I'm one of those weirdos.
[00:56:49.686 --> 00:56:50.486]  I'm a free bird.
[00:56:50.647 --> 00:56:54.068]  I want to be free, and I guess Kurt Vonnegut was, too.
[00:56:56.990 --> 00:57:00.712]  It would really help, though, the people that I know that are even more famous than Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:57:01.564 --> 00:57:04.185]  More famous than anybody we've ever talked about here on air.
[00:57:04.826 --> 00:57:06.266]  Would go public for freedom.
[00:57:08.367 --> 00:57:09.248]  And who knows, they might.
[00:57:11.489 --> 00:57:15.751]  But in one of their words, people I was talking to, they've already gone through quite a bit, I guess.
[00:57:17.272 --> 00:57:21.174]  So who am I to tell folks to stand up when they've already stood up and paid such a high price?
[00:57:26.496 --> 00:57:28.562]  You know, I think it comes down to this at the end of the day.
[00:57:29.325 --> 00:57:31.110]  If you don't have an instinct...
[00:57:31.909 --> 00:57:49.473]  When you see classical forms of slavery being set up, and as a free man, you see that your freedom is being undermined, and that you're being surrounded, and that parasites are amassing weaponry, and trying to menace you, and trying to break your will, and train you to accept their authority and domination over you.
[00:57:49.973 --> 00:57:56.174]  It'd be one thing 15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, if you weren't awake.
[00:57:56.694 --> 00:57:59.935]  But you've got to be deaf, dumb, and blind to not know
[00:58:00.675 --> 00:58:04.056]  That our whole culture is in deep trouble and crooks are running things.
[00:58:06.177 --> 00:58:21.043]  And to see the media nonchalantly pushing it, oh yeah, it's real easy, the feds are going to be over your farming equipment now, and there's going to be some inspections, and they're going to be coming out and making sure you got your log books all together, and there's going to be some fines.
[00:58:22.483 --> 00:58:23.564]  And the sick part is,
[00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:32.014]  They're going to get all the rodeos and all the fairs involved and all the tractor supply companies involved.
[00:58:32.074 --> 00:58:40.038]  So when you want to go buy a tractor or go to the fair, they already do this with Animal ID, Premises ID, they won't let you in if you haven't complied.
[00:58:45.642 --> 00:58:49.604]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.830 --> 00:59:07.294]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:08.294 --> 00:59:11.955]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:12.987 --> 00:59:24.998]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:59:25.759 --> 00:59:33.025]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:59:33.706 --> 00:59:43.288]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:59:44.068 --> 00:59:47.329]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:59:47.989 --> 00:59:51.190]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:59:54.911 --> 00:59:56.831]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:57.291 --> 01:00:00.052]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:10.847]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.548 --> 01:00:12.328]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.129 --> 01:00:15.030]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:18.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.853 --> 01:00:22.916]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.119 --> 01:00:26.679]  So, Ron Paul won yet another straw poll.
[01:00:26.719 --> 01:00:31.200]  He's winning in almost all the polls in all the key states, Iowa, New Hampshire.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.261]  But I turned on the radio, TV this morning, internet, Ron Paul can't win, Ron Paul can't win.
[01:00:36.601 --> 01:00:46.483]  It's like a race car driver who is half a circuit in front of everybody and he's gaining ground and they're going, he can't win, he can't win.
[01:00:46.763 --> 01:00:52.744]  They're doing that because they're going to put some spikes up to blow his tires out and they're going to steal the election from him.
[01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:56.010]  Well then why do I support him if the elections are rigged?
[01:00:56.371 --> 01:01:00.400]  Because he's going to be able to educate people out there and further illustrate what's happening.
[01:01:01.122 --> 01:01:03.186]  And if there's a big enough landslide, the different...
[01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:12.305]  Analysis we've done and other experts have done, like Bev Harris of Black Box Voting, they're not going to be able to steal it if there's a landslide.
[01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:14.526]  Let's go ahead and talk.
[01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:18.268]  I'm going to take a lot of calls this hour, into the third hour with Bob Chapman.
[01:01:18.748 --> 01:01:20.829]  I haven't even gotten into all the financial news.
[01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:21.610]  We're going to cover it.
[01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.471]  They've got a new super vaccine called Draco.
[01:01:25.571 --> 01:01:26.772]  You can't make this up.
[01:01:27.913 --> 01:01:29.974]  Where you're never going to get sick again, you take this.
[01:01:31.573 --> 01:01:44.702]  Yeah, man, I've been listening here for about a year now and everything, you know, and me and my fiancé always talked about how we'd love to move down to Austin and me have the opportunity to work for you.
[01:01:44.722 --> 01:01:45.302]  And here, July 3rd,
[01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:02.235]  My fiance just passed away in a wreck and I'm sitting here listening to your show.
[01:02:02.755 --> 01:02:03.476]  Got me thinking.
[01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:12.018]  I'm gonna call in and see if there's some way that I can move myself from redneck Texas to front lines of the info war.
[01:02:12.158 --> 01:02:13.299]  Well, here's one issue.
[01:02:13.339 --> 01:02:15.459]  We don't have the money to hire anybody else.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:16.580]  And
[01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:23.172]  I don't know you and as I said, Jacob, I'm sorry to hear your fiancé died in a car wreck.
[01:02:24.053 --> 01:02:25.534]  This is what I'm talking about, about plugs.
[01:02:25.594 --> 01:02:34.541]  It's all like a personal thing or something somebody's doing or about what I'm supposed to do with the caller when we're talking about news and information.
[01:02:35.442 --> 01:02:37.623]  But send me, send me...
[01:02:38.664 --> 01:02:42.026]  Ideas of what you want to do, what you'd want to work for.
[01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:49.969]  Send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com, but I can't make any promises and I appreciate your call and I'm honored that you'd want to work here.
[01:02:50.749 --> 01:02:51.029]  I am.
[01:02:56.332 --> 01:03:03.675]  You know, at the end of the day, too, we can't just hire more people because I've then got to train them and they've got to specifically know how we do things around here.
[01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:13.046]  Does anybody care that the feds are coming in saying they have jurisdiction over your farms and ranches?
[01:03:13.586 --> 01:03:23.109]  Not just with animal ID, premises ID, but now they want to come in and make you get commercial drivers licenses and training that then puts you under their jurisdiction.
[01:03:23.129 --> 01:03:35.513]  You sign into it and you waive your rights and now they can drug test you, they can, they're going to make you keep logs and everywhere you go and also harass you about the state of your farming equipment.
[01:03:35.554 --> 01:03:36.574]  I mean this is just
[01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:38.509]  On so many fronts.
[01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:39.671]  Not their jurisdiction.
[01:03:39.731 --> 01:03:40.452]  Power grab.
[01:03:40.753 --> 01:03:42.135]  Worse than the Soviet Union.
[01:03:42.716 --> 01:03:43.777]  Total bureaucracy.
[01:03:43.858 --> 01:03:47.303]  Big Agras, of course, proposing this to shut down their competition.
[01:03:48.364 --> 01:03:49.606]  I mean, does anybody care about that?
[01:03:50.488 --> 01:03:51.790]  Beth in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:03:53.069 --> 01:04:07.618]  Hi Alex, I just want to say first of all, briefly, I'm a big fan of yours and I was at the Texas rally, the anti-groping rally with you and really support what you do, but I wanted to take a moment here to basically play devil's advocate.
[01:04:08.398 --> 01:04:11.520]  A friend I was talking to who's somewhat a critic of yours,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.340]  I think so.
[01:04:34.312 --> 01:04:36.373]  Second caller about Alex Jones.
[01:04:37.533 --> 01:04:38.214]  Stay there, Beth.
[01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:39.894]  We'll come back and respond to it.
[01:04:40.554 --> 01:04:41.535]  It's very simple.
[01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.476]  I push what I believe in.
[01:04:45.476 --> 01:04:57.561]  God, guts, guns, gold, private property, family, red-blooded freedom, red-blooded women, red-blooded families, red-blooded cars.
[01:04:58.642 --> 01:05:01.963]  I mean, you're talking red-blooded America.
[01:05:03.018 --> 01:05:04.520]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.765]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:10.045 --> 01:05:11.406]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:20.355]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:21.096 --> 01:05:28.201]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:28.622 --> 01:05:36.247]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:41.551]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.033]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:05:52.221 --> 01:05:54.504]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:02.791]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:02.811 --> 01:06:09.497]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:12.040]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:17.485]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:17.685 --> 01:06:20.466]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:22.827]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:23.027 --> 01:06:28.970]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:32.491]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:32.671 --> 01:06:38.194]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:39.754]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:40.095 --> 01:06:41.275]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:43.936]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:44.056 --> 01:06:45.477]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:06:45.737 --> 01:06:48.119]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:48.279 --> 01:06:52.782]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:52.902 --> 01:06:55.364]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:06:55.484 --> 01:06:59.207]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:01.088]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:04.710]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:07:05.031 --> 01:07:08.473]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long term story
[01:07:08.473 --> 01:07:09.093]  We're good to go.
[01:07:38.556 --> 01:07:39.217]  We're good to go.
[01:08:03.021 --> 01:08:05.228]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:08.597]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.412 --> 01:08:24.519]  Okay, we're going to have open phones throughout this hour and the next hour with our weekly visit with Bob Chapman.
[01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:33.411]  Boy, what a timely guest that's going to be with the huge developments in the world economy, the admissions that, hey, we're really in a global depression.
[01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:44.940]  And the big mega banks are continuing the policies of zero interest rates or negative interest rates for themselves while jacking up real interest rates for the people of the planet.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:50.326]  That is a recipe for absolute financial Armageddon and total consolidation.
[01:08:51.267 --> 01:08:52.528]  Also coming up, U.S.
[01:08:52.568 --> 01:08:58.312]  consumer confidence drops to three-decade low amid economic headwinds.
[01:08:58.432 --> 01:09:05.096]  Bloomberg Postal Service proposed cutting 120,000 jobs, pulling out of Obama health care plan.
[01:09:05.116 --> 01:09:07.097]  Because, of course, you get a waiver.
[01:09:07.137 --> 01:09:07.897]  You're an insider.
[01:09:08.558 --> 01:09:14.942]  Democratic Hill staffers head to Maui on taxpayer's dime for Senate Indian Affairs Committee field hearing.
[01:09:16.232 --> 01:09:23.341]  Incredible Mark of the Beast reports, electronic skin tattoo has medical, gaming, and spy uses.
[01:09:23.781 --> 01:09:28.787]  And see, many devices coming out are only going to work when interfacing with these systems.
[01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:31.891]  And that's what the technocrats said over a decade ago.
[01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:35.215]  They said, look, the public's going to accept this because we're just going to offer it.
[01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:37.739]  You want to get in Disney World?
[01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:38.839]  You want to get a job here?
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.641]  You want to work for the Mexican Attorney General?
[01:09:41.681 --> 01:09:42.401]  Gotta take a chip.
[01:09:42.821 --> 01:09:45.002]  Now it's being extremely mainlined.
[01:09:45.383 --> 01:09:48.904]  A whole new level of chips that are right under the skin.
[01:09:49.445 --> 01:09:52.226]  Continuing, how computers will soon get under your skin.
[01:09:52.306 --> 01:09:52.986]  London Independent.
[01:09:53.507 --> 01:10:00.290]  A stick-out circuit can monitor heart rate as well as conventional devices, but is weightless, wireless, and inconspicuous.
[01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.811]  It's all how great it is.
[01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:05.233]  Also, Pentagon admits they're approving more and more Hollywood scripts.
[01:10:06.033 --> 01:10:10.755]  Another sign we're living in a very, very un-American type system.
[01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:16.337]  Brevik called police at least 10 times to surrender, and they wouldn't come get him, so he said he continued the shooting.
[01:10:19.178 --> 01:10:28.742]  Also, greatest discovery since penicillin, a cure for everything, from colds to HIV, a new magic vaccine called Draco!
[01:10:30.763 --> 01:10:32.364]  The dragon will heal you!
[01:10:33.851 --> 01:10:37.053]  And they've got new vaccines where you'll never get addicted to drugs anymore, never get depressed.
[01:10:37.874 --> 01:10:40.376]  The virus goes in and changes your brain chemistry.
[01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:47.040]  And they've got movies out to mainline it, like The New Planet of the Apes, where the virus they inject you with makes you so smart.
[01:10:47.561 --> 01:10:48.742]  It rewires your brain.
[01:10:49.022 --> 01:10:49.943]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:10:50.883 --> 01:10:53.285]  You see, we're coming to the point where it won't matter.
[01:10:54.086 --> 01:11:00.050]  Even if you want to resist, well, it's vaccines and your food they're coming out with, as Bill Gates is pushing, so you can't escape it.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.808]  So that's just some of the news, and obviously I want to talk about Ron Paul.
[01:11:04.089 --> 01:11:08.302]  He keeps winning the major scientific polls and straw polls in the coveted
[01:11:09.952 --> 01:11:19.295]  Crim-dolla-crim, holy grail, ultimate, paramount places, New Hampshire, Iowa, and it gets almost no media coverage!
[01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:26.637]  And then this mantra, he cannot win, he cannot win, he cannot win, when he's number one, number two, or number three in all polls, going back six months.
[01:11:27.297 --> 01:11:28.198]  He could win!
[01:11:28.218 --> 01:11:29.658]  He could win!
[01:11:29.678 --> 01:11:30.998]  He could win!
[01:11:31.018 --> 01:11:39.001]  And he's warned people, he said, I'm not gonna be able to fix everything, because under the Constitution, I'm not a dictator.
[01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:42.190]  It's like the ring of Sauron.
[01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:45.711]  Even if he was dictator and tried, it would create a horrible system.
[01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:49.993]  Even if you try to use command and control for good, it will not work.
[01:11:50.153 --> 01:11:50.874]  It doesn't work.
[01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:56.576]  Because the people he put under him to carry that out would not be upright, perfect individuals.
[01:11:56.796 --> 01:11:57.557]  Ron Paul isn't.
[01:11:58.157 --> 01:12:00.418]  But he's got a perfect voting record, never compromises.
[01:12:00.498 --> 01:12:02.279]  That is one in a million.
[01:12:03.817 --> 01:12:10.079]  But he said he could expose the Federal Reserve, he could get the people behind him and Congress behind him, and really try to change things.
[01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:10.839]  And it could happen.
[01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:13.500]  And isn't it the way God works?
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:30.725]  That we're right here at this time of total collapse, at the hands of the Federal Reserve, for 30-plus years he's fought them, people are finally listening to him, everything he's talked about is coming true, right as he gets to the point of being able to win the presidency, the New World Order train rolls into the station, and everything we've talked about is coming true,
[01:12:31.605 --> 01:12:33.746]  And he's saying, do you choose me as the president?
[01:12:34.006 --> 01:12:36.647]  And the government's like, he cannot win, he cannot win, he cannot win.
[01:12:36.947 --> 01:12:37.487]  Ignore him.
[01:12:37.727 --> 01:12:42.089]  Too bad he's winning all the polls, or most of the polls and straw polls, because he cannot win.
[01:12:44.269 --> 01:12:49.871]  He goes to the high-powered CPAC Republican convention that Ronald Reagan and others won before becoming president.
[01:12:50.071 --> 01:12:51.292]  He wins it two years in a row.
[01:12:51.572 --> 01:12:53.853]  Fox dubs in old audio of booing.
[01:12:54.473 --> 01:12:54.993]  Gets caught.
[01:12:57.469 --> 01:13:05.975]  When he gets up and says Republicans are anti-war, there's almost a complete standing ovation, breaking the illusion that Republicans are all a bunch of idiot warmongers.
[01:13:06.775 --> 01:13:17.742]  They're scared to death, and I heard these local talk shows this morning going, in between attacking Norris Truly, saying, oh, too bad he can't win, we like him.
[01:13:18.803 --> 01:13:23.686]  And every caller, I sat there for 30 minutes listening to the show, they probably took 10 calls.
[01:13:24.186 --> 01:13:24.847]  It's a call show.
[01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:27.856]  And every one of them said, I love Ron Paul, he can win.
[01:13:27.876 --> 01:13:29.617]  And they said, no he can't.
[01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:32.138]  Every caller wanted him!
[01:13:33.898 --> 01:13:36.119]  But they're still pushing the illusion he can't win.
[01:13:36.459 --> 01:13:41.061]  We've got to break this hoax that he can't win.
[01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:41.861]  So I want to talk about that.
[01:13:41.902 --> 01:13:43.422]  Now I want to get to your calls.
[01:13:43.442 --> 01:13:50.325]  And the problem is, I went to Jake earlier, and then I went to Beth in that short little segment earlier, and of course callers bring up big, giant
[01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:52.547]  Weighty issues.
[01:13:53.087 --> 01:13:56.408]  And it's so, and I'm going to go back to Beth in a minute, but I want to answer her question now.
[01:13:57.429 --> 01:14:01.710]  It's so, and I'll give her a counterpoint, it's so one-dimensional.
[01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.871]  And it's not Beth.
[01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:09.472]  She said her friend, if you just tuned in, she wanted to play devil's advocate.
[01:14:10.232 --> 01:14:19.235]  Her friend said, oh, Alex Jones is just promoting gold because his boss, Ted Anderson, is telling him to.
[01:14:20.185 --> 01:14:22.787]  Well, A, Ted Anderson isn't my boss.
[01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:34.817]  I am a free, contract, independent, who decides to be syndicated through Genesis, because I've known Ted for 14, 15 years, and he's never tried to censor me.
[01:14:35.878 --> 01:14:37.239]  And he's a sponsor of my show.
[01:14:37.459 --> 01:14:37.820]  That's it.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:38.580]  Okay?
[01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:46.347]  In fact, I can run my whole show right here, but I like John Harmon, who's been running my show for six years so much, that we still take calls from Minnesota, because I like to talk to John.
[01:14:47.847 --> 01:14:49.488]  I like the cheerfulness in his voice.
[01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:50.089]  He's my friend.
[01:14:50.109 --> 01:14:51.429]  Okay?
[01:14:51.449 --> 01:14:52.991]  I can open the phones up right now.
[01:14:53.371 --> 01:14:58.454]  I could call up and in two days rent any satellite system I wanted to and beam into our stations.
[01:14:59.075 --> 01:15:00.676]  But I'm a loyal person.
[01:15:00.736 --> 01:15:01.396]  I like Ted.
[01:15:01.676 --> 01:15:03.358]  He's a libertarian constitutionalist.
[01:15:03.558 --> 01:15:04.819]  He's a big Ron Paul supporter.
[01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:12.063]  He's a fellow intellectual traveler, to steal one of the commies' terms.
[01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:15.372]  And I only promote what I believe in.
[01:15:15.392 --> 01:15:19.776]  And is my belief in gold and silver been borne out to be good?
[01:15:19.796 --> 01:15:20.116]  I don't know.
[01:15:21.597 --> 01:15:22.478]  In fact, I was correct.
[01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.380]  And when I first started promoting gold, it was $260 an ounce.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:24.660]  I keep saying $300.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.200]  It was $260 11 years ago.
[01:15:25.261 --> 01:15:25.941]  And silver was about $450.
[01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:27.482]  So I keep saying silver was $5 and gold was...
[01:15:40.017 --> 01:15:40.898]  Two hundred and something.
[01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:57.953]  And I knew that when they got rid of Glass-Steagall, and all the economists I had on said, it would cause something worse than fractional reserve banking, that it would debase the currency fully, because now the central banks could issue unlimited fiat counterfeit financial instruments.
[01:15:58.613 --> 01:16:03.134]  It'd be like if I could suddenly write trillion dollar checks and people had to cash them.
[01:16:03.194 --> 01:16:04.974]  I mean, I would suddenly start taking over everything.
[01:16:05.355 --> 01:16:06.975]  But only the insiders can do this.
[01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:10.436]  And so, in every case in history, commodities go up.
[01:16:10.496 --> 01:16:11.976]  I mean, has housing gone up?
[01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:13.336]  Has gasoline gone up?
[01:16:13.376 --> 01:16:14.577]  Has the price of a car gone up?
[01:16:14.817 --> 01:16:16.397]  Has the price of a gallon of milk gone up?
[01:16:16.637 --> 01:16:18.437]  Has the price of a tube of toothpaste gone up?
[01:16:18.597 --> 01:16:19.098]  Absolutely.
[01:16:19.438 --> 01:16:20.858]  Has the price of education gone up?
[01:16:21.438 --> 01:16:24.299]  Has the price of every commodity gone up?
[01:16:24.979 --> 01:16:25.359]  And so,
[01:16:27.313 --> 01:16:28.134]  Is gold in a bubble?
[01:16:28.195 --> 01:16:30.759]  That's something we've discussed in detail.
[01:16:32.241 --> 01:16:38.130]  And most economists I've talked to who've been right in the past, in my own research, say that $2,500, it could be a bubble.
[01:16:42.659 --> 01:16:45.480]  But that's at current devaluation.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:50.762]  If they keep devaluing, and you're denominating golden dollars, $10,000.
[01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:59.165]  I mean, in Weimar Republic, a loaf of bread wasn't really 10 million Deutschmarks.
[01:16:59.785 --> 01:17:06.248]  I mean, 10 million Deutschmarks just a decade before would buy entire towns.
[01:17:07.048 --> 01:17:08.729]  Ten years later, it couldn't buy a loaf of bread.
[01:17:09.679 --> 01:17:12.600]  So it sounds crazy to say $10,000 an ounce gold.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.960]  How about $1,000,000 an ounce?
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.441]  How about $10,000,000 an ounce?
[01:17:15.721 --> 01:17:20.282]  I mean, if they reduce it down to nothing, I'm not predicting it's going to go that far.
[01:17:22.603 --> 01:17:24.544]  But people are like, it's a bubble at $500.
[01:17:24.744 --> 01:17:25.084]  It's a bubble at $800.
[01:17:25.124 --> 01:17:25.624]  It's a bubble at $900, $1,000, $1,200, $1,500, $1,800.
[01:17:25.744 --> 01:17:25.984]  No, it's not.
[01:17:26.004 --> 01:17:27.504]  For inflation, a couple years ago, it should be $2,500 an ounce.
[01:17:27.524 --> 01:17:28.425]  Right now, right up at $3,000.
[01:17:40.237 --> 01:17:42.079]  Or 1980 Inflation Index.
[01:17:42.879 --> 01:17:57.050]  And so, it is such mindlessness, such incredible folly, that I have gone to family events and had distant family.
[01:17:57.070 --> 01:18:00.673]  Well, not even so-called distant, but not real close family.
[01:18:00.713 --> 01:18:02.474]  People that know me well, that I see like every three years.
[01:18:04.275 --> 01:18:04.716]  And they're like,
[01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:08.492]  I'm like, hey, I told you gold at $300 was going to go up.
[01:18:08.552 --> 01:18:09.252]  It's like $800 now.
[01:18:09.272 --> 01:18:09.852]  Are you going to buy?
[01:18:09.872 --> 01:18:11.232]  This is like three or four years ago.
[01:18:11.252 --> 01:18:13.673]  They're like, no, man, it's a bubble.
[01:18:14.053 --> 01:18:14.973]  You gold people.
[01:18:15.073 --> 01:18:15.814]  I'm in the stock market.
[01:18:16.194 --> 01:18:16.774]  I'm like, OK.
[01:18:17.594 --> 01:18:19.215]  See him a couple of years later.
[01:18:19.235 --> 01:18:20.815]  Hey, it's at $1,200 right now.
[01:18:21.755 --> 01:18:22.735]  Silver's, you know, way up.
[01:18:22.775 --> 01:18:23.696]  Are you going to buy any of that?
[01:18:24.716 --> 01:18:24.996]  No.
[01:18:25.076 --> 01:18:27.117]  And I said, well, listen, I recommend you do.
[01:18:27.237 --> 01:18:31.958]  And I literally had family, two of them, laugh at me and go, you recommend.
[01:18:35.123 --> 01:18:36.685]  I'm just, you know, completely right.
[01:18:36.705 --> 01:18:39.749]  Because see, they watch CNBC.
[01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:42.733]  They watch fancy experts.
[01:18:43.174 --> 01:18:44.536]  And see, they can laugh.
[01:18:44.616 --> 01:18:46.939]  It's like that Alex Jones.
[01:18:47.219 --> 01:18:50.583]  He's not promoting gold and silver because he's been completely right.
[01:18:52.406 --> 01:18:57.070]  And silver's up eight times and gold's up, what, seven, almost eight times.
[01:18:57.371 --> 01:18:59.293]  Best investment, bar none, of the decade.
[01:18:59.853 --> 01:19:01.214]  This guy's been completely right!
[01:19:01.475 --> 01:19:08.141]  It's like this crazy guy called every NFL game a year out exactly to the score.
[01:19:08.501 --> 01:19:09.562]  Man, he's a kook!
[01:19:09.983 --> 01:19:12.785]  He's on record calling the games exactly as they happen.
[01:19:12.985 --> 01:19:14.587]  What a discredited scumbag!
[01:19:17.029 --> 01:19:22.131]  He said they'd bankrupt the world economy and call for a global bank you'd pay your carbon taxes to and VAT.
[01:19:22.331 --> 01:19:23.471]  Oh, here it is at Newsweek!
[01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:24.972]  Ten years after he said it!
[01:19:25.132 --> 01:19:26.252]  This guy's a nut!
[01:19:27.793 --> 01:19:33.214]  Listen, this scumbag Alex Jones said buy silver at $4.50 an ounce and now it's up at $40.
[01:19:35.015 --> 01:19:36.596]  Man, this guy's bad news, man.
[01:19:37.636 --> 01:19:38.736]  It's that Ted Anderson.
[01:19:38.776 --> 01:19:40.217]  He's the one behind it all.
[01:19:41.545 --> 01:19:42.927]  Alex Jones is a follower.
[01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:47.412]  Ted Anderson at night flies down here in a helicopter and slaps me around.
[01:19:48.012 --> 01:19:50.135]  And I crawl on the ground and he bosses me.
[01:19:51.076 --> 01:19:54.840]  And he tells me, he says, Jones, you don't want to promote gold, but I say you are!
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.922]  And I'm like, no, I don't want to give him that advice!
[01:19:57.223 --> 01:19:58.544]  It's up eight times, Ted!
[01:19:58.764 --> 01:19:59.986]  Stop abusing the listeners!
[01:20:00.326 --> 01:20:01.507]  Stop making them so much money!
[01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:03.689]  Meet Jerry D. Hi.
[01:20:03.989 --> 01:20:12.692]  Jerry and his family, like you, are very concerned about world conditions and have gathered many emergency preparedness items, including turtle tuft shelters.
[01:20:13.153 --> 01:20:21.436]  We have added two 24-foot turtle tufts to our supplies and feel very secure knowing our large family is ready for whatever is
[01:20:22.659 --> 01:20:24.820]  TurtleTuff shelters are not tents.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:34.886]  They are permanent, yet portable, four-season geodesic frame shelters that are as strong as a cabin at a fraction of the cost and are easy to set up, take down, and move anywhere.

[01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:07.307]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:21:07.728 --> 01:21:13.592]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:21:14.153 --> 01:21:15.914]  Number one, study the past.
[01:21:16.435 --> 01:21:18.196]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:21:18.837 --> 01:21:22.559]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:21:23.672 --> 01:21:25.934]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:21:26.754 --> 01:21:30.037]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:21:30.597 --> 01:21:35.340]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:39.103]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:21:39.663 --> 01:21:42.525]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:46.708]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:21:47.549 --> 01:21:51.791]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[01:22:30.925 --> 01:22:31.986]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:36.549]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.729 --> 01:22:42.413]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.533 --> 01:22:45.955]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:48.777]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:53.800]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.181]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.201 --> 01:22:55.602]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.985 --> 01:23:02.907]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[01:23:03.027 --> 01:23:04.988]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.
[01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:07.670]  Why and what can you do to defend your family?
[01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:14.916]  This week at WaterWebinar.com, in an all-new free live online webinar, Earth's most powerful cleansing secret is being revealed.
[01:23:15.096 --> 01:23:17.157]  A secret they don't want you to know about.
[01:23:17.337 --> 01:23:21.100]  Find out how to take fluoride and heavy metals out of your water and your body.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.823]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum,
[01:23:24.943 --> 01:23:25.624]  We're good to go.
[01:23:47.046 --> 01:23:47.767]  We're good to go.
[01:24:16.867 --> 01:24:26.792]  Well, I was going to go back to Beth, who was bringing up her friend's Devil's Advocate story, but she hung up.
[01:24:29.113 --> 01:24:45.161]  Continuing here, when I'm going to Steve, Marie, Valerie, John, and others, you know, you can play Devil's Advocate all day long, but when you've studied history, you notice that historically, tyrants always have an official reason they're doing something.
[01:24:47.304 --> 01:24:49.065]  But does it ever turn out the way they say it is?
[01:24:49.185 --> 01:24:49.365]  No.
[01:24:49.465 --> 01:24:50.126]  It gets worse.
[01:24:50.186 --> 01:24:51.046]  Government gets bigger.
[01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:55.269]  Every solution they've got, things get more and more dire.
[01:24:58.191 --> 01:25:01.833]  As I keep saying, I'm very upset gold has gone above $1,800 this week.
[01:25:01.853 --> 01:25:02.193]  I'm very upset.
[01:25:06.892 --> 01:25:11.697]  Because that means they're going ahead with total hyperinflation and worldwide depression, and that means a war.
[01:25:11.997 --> 01:25:13.499]  They always have a war on top of it.
[01:25:13.839 --> 01:25:16.021]  I mean, folks, it's time to gut up.
[01:25:16.602 --> 01:25:21.487]  It's time for every man, woman, and child out there to realize our civilization is in deep trouble.
[01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:29.595]  And you better believe the minute I ever think that the gold bubble
[01:25:30.606 --> 01:25:32.448]  Is going to pop, I will tell you.
[01:25:33.248 --> 01:25:37.092]  I have never sold one stinking piece of gold or silver I've bought.
[01:25:37.492 --> 01:25:40.635]  Not gold I bought at 250-something bucks, not gold I bought at $1,700.
[01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:44.959]  I have never sold one piece of it.
[01:25:45.519 --> 01:25:47.201]  Not one piece.
[01:25:47.781 --> 01:25:48.582]  What does that tell you?
[01:25:49.963 --> 01:25:50.684]  What does that tell you?
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.001]  I don't come in here with teleprompters.
[01:25:54.021 --> 01:25:55.903]  You know the new news program you're seeing, the news alerts?
[01:25:56.264 --> 01:25:57.505]  Some of them two-hour long shows?
[01:25:57.905 --> 01:26:00.247]  There's not a teleprompter there, boys and girls.
[01:26:02.389 --> 01:26:03.170]  I read this news.
[01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:03.971]  I study this news.
[01:26:04.011 --> 01:26:05.112]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:26:05.132 --> 01:26:07.034]  I'm not putting on an act here.
[01:26:08.215 --> 01:26:14.561]  Folks, I lost almost all the radio stations I was on ten years ago because I wouldn't stop saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:19.789]  I'm not just here to make money.
[01:26:19.869 --> 01:26:22.910]  Oh, I want to be successful and strong and build my operation and be comfortable.
[01:26:23.130 --> 01:26:24.770]  But that's not what I'm looking for.
[01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:25.211]  That's not.
[01:26:26.071 --> 01:26:27.291]  Truth is what I'm after.
[01:26:29.152 --> 01:26:34.734]  Now, if I can make money telling people what I believe is the truth and what I'm personally doing, you better believe I'm going to do it.
[01:26:35.868 --> 01:26:37.550]  How do you think we built this operation?
[01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:47.660]  Why can the news have all their sponsors and all the stuff they're pitching, but then it's always evil when Alex Jones sells a book or an InfoWars.com camo baseball cap.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.282]  By the way, quite handsome, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:50.743 --> 01:26:54.286]  That's always a COINTELPRO response and answer.
[01:26:54.546 --> 01:26:58.050]  Now, does that mean your friend is a COINTELPRO response or answer?
[01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:06.353]  No, it just means they feel like idiots that they didn't buy gold when it was $300 or $500 or $1,000 or $1,500.
[01:27:06.893 --> 01:27:09.694]  Look at that 10-year graph if you're a PrisonPlanet.TV viewer.
[01:27:10.274 --> 01:27:12.495]  Or go to a website, type in 10-year graph.
[01:27:13.376 --> 01:27:18.417]  You can go back and find videos I did two years ago saying that once it hit $1,500 it'd go parabolic.
[01:27:18.498 --> 01:27:18.978]  And look at it.
[01:27:20.078 --> 01:27:21.199]  It's now parabolic.
[01:27:21.219 --> 01:27:22.539]  You know what that means?
[01:27:22.639 --> 01:27:23.579]  Straight up.
[01:27:23.819 --> 01:27:24.680]  Straight up.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:27.361]  Because America is going straight down.
[01:27:28.407 --> 01:27:30.749]  People are like, be positive, don't destroy confidence.
[01:27:31.049 --> 01:27:33.671]  I'm not the one destroying confidence, the mega banks are.
[01:27:33.931 --> 01:27:36.033]  They want to gut this country to consolidate it.
[01:27:36.053 --> 01:27:42.318]  And this is probably why I don't take calls a lot.
[01:27:42.538 --> 01:27:46.782]  Because when I do take them and somebody gets me going on a subject, it gets me angry.
[01:27:52.369 --> 01:27:55.830]  Let's talk to Steve in New York, to Marie, Valerie, John, Mark, and everybody.
[01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:56.150]  Go ahead.
[01:27:56.170 --> 01:28:01.491]  We got Mark, who's a farmer, probably wants to talk about federal regulations on his property, we're going to tell you about.
[01:28:01.811 --> 01:28:02.891]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:28:04.652 --> 01:28:04.932]  Alex.
[01:28:06.212 --> 01:28:06.572]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:06.612 --> 01:28:07.152]  Oh, dear.
[01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:13.273]  Why?
[01:28:13.293 --> 01:28:16.134]  It's like this show is run by the Bride of Frankenstein now.
[01:28:17.354 --> 01:28:20.315]  Why can't people just listen to you and pay attention?
[01:28:21.317 --> 01:28:22.618]  Not hear you, but listen.
[01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:31.062]  If this Beth would have been listening, she could have had that argument with her friend and put it to rest on the spot.
[01:28:32.122 --> 01:28:33.983]  I'm sorry, you can't say it, but I can.
[01:28:34.243 --> 01:28:34.944]  What did you call her?
[01:28:36.164 --> 01:28:36.404]  Beth.
[01:28:36.784 --> 01:28:37.125]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:41.947]  She would have been a faithful listener like she said she was, and listened instead of just hear you.
[01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:44.862]  She would have been able to have that argument.
[01:28:44.983 --> 01:28:46.504]  I don't think Beth is bad.
[01:28:46.564 --> 01:28:48.886]  She got laughed at by one of her screwball friends.
[01:28:48.966 --> 01:28:55.691]  Listen, listen, no, if that guy, if her friend listened, he isn't going to listen when Gold's $3,000 an ounce.
[01:28:56.532 --> 01:29:00.515]  If the Army came by and told him to get on a truck to go to a relocation center, he'd do it.
[01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:06.699]  These people will always twist things around in their minds because they're chicken neck followers.
[01:29:06.799 --> 01:29:07.080]  I went
[01:29:08.183 --> 01:29:09.343]  Something I only do a few times a year.
[01:29:09.363 --> 01:29:10.524]  I don't know, four or five times a year.
[01:29:10.544 --> 01:29:13.824]  I went to the mall last night because my children wanted to go to the Lego shop.
[01:29:14.745 --> 01:29:15.805]  We like Lego games.
[01:29:16.605 --> 01:29:21.707]  And I mean, and myself included, but they, everybody looked like brain dead zombies.
[01:29:22.167 --> 01:29:26.308]  They look totally spiritless, rudderless, soulless.
[01:29:27.435 --> 01:29:28.115]  Lost.
[01:29:29.116 --> 01:29:32.297]  All of the clerks treat everybody like garbage.
[01:29:33.718 --> 01:29:34.318]  They would demand ID.
[01:29:35.178 --> 01:29:39.520]  I went and bought a water in a place and a manager ran out and tried to imply we'd stolen it.
[01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:41.641]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:29:41.801 --> 01:29:43.682]  I want to see what you originally called in about, Steve.
[01:29:43.922 --> 01:29:45.883]  And I promise, I'm going to shut up.
[01:29:46.783 --> 01:29:47.764]  The farmer hung up.
[01:29:47.824 --> 01:29:48.844]  I want to hear from the farmer.
[01:29:48.864 --> 01:29:48.904]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:48.924 --> 01:29:49.584]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.624 --> 01:29:50.405]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.425 --> 01:29:51.165]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.295 --> 01:29:59.037]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.239 --> 01:30:06.881]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:07.261 --> 01:30:10.263]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:10.503 --> 01:30:15.306]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:21.529]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:21.689 --> 01:30:23.931]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:24.471 --> 01:30:24.751]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:24.771 --> 01:30:25.191]  Bernanke?
[01:30:25.272 --> 01:30:25.632]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:25.652 --> 01:30:26.392]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:26.412 --> 01:30:28.754]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:43.382 --> 01:30:50.328]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:50.649 --> 01:30:59.777]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:02.881 --> 01:31:04.402]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:04.602 --> 01:31:09.647]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:09.907 --> 01:31:11.268]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:11.448 --> 01:31:20.256]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:28.059]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:28.499 --> 01:31:36.082]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:36.502 --> 01:31:41.423]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:31:41.723 --> 01:31:45.224]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:31:45.244 --> 01:31:49.526]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:32:01.411 --> 01:32:05.634]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:06.554]  Number 1.
[01:32:06.874 --> 01:32:10.016]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:10.297 --> 01:32:10.857]  Number 2.
[01:32:11.157 --> 01:32:15.700]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:16.501]  It's true.
[01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:21.344]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.664 --> 01:32:22.204]  Number 3.
[01:32:22.484 --> 01:32:25.766]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:26.067 --> 01:32:29.789]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.969 --> 01:32:30.530]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:33.133]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:33.533 --> 01:32:36.918]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:37.418]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.999 --> 01:32:41.924]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:42.164 --> 01:32:46.910]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:51.234]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:51.375 --> 01:32:52.916]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:53.157 --> 01:32:55.239]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:55.399 --> 01:32:57.681]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:57.701 --> 01:32:58.322]  By the way, earlier...
[01:33:09.938 --> 01:33:12.822]  He almost said, I just want to open the phones up for farmers.
[01:33:12.902 --> 01:33:15.145]  What do you think of the government proposing?
[01:33:15.165 --> 01:33:18.510]  They always say, there's a comment period, and then we're going to do whatever we want.
[01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:20.332]  Kind of like the Super Congress.
[01:33:21.233 --> 01:33:24.798]  Six members of the House and Senate, respectively, 12 total, with the president.
[01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:34.835]  We're going to develop the new spending legislation and the cut legislation and the taxing legislation, which is basically all of Congress.
[01:33:35.175 --> 01:33:36.616]  At the end of the day, it's all about funding.
[01:33:37.016 --> 01:33:39.557]  And then we're going to propose it to Congress for an up or down vote.
[01:33:39.818 --> 01:33:41.779]  And if you don't agree with us, we'll just do whatever we want.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:54.787]  We're going to have a commercial driver's license with all the regulations and fees and inspections of all farm equipment, no matter how great or small, that has a motor in it or moving parts in it.
[01:33:55.894 --> 01:33:59.380]  And it's a federal power grab outside their jurisdiction.
[01:33:59.781 --> 01:34:01.444]  It's hellish what they do to truck drivers.
[01:34:01.544 --> 01:34:03.468]  It's only targeting small farms and ranches.
[01:34:03.848 --> 01:34:05.331]  It's part of the Animal ID, Premises ID.
[01:34:08.618 --> 01:34:17.727]  And I'll guarantee you, there's going to be devil's advocate morons out there that are going to say, well, there might be some dangerous farm equipment and the feds care about us.
[01:34:18.768 --> 01:34:20.749]  Oh, gee whales there.
[01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:28.136]  Hey, Donald, let's go down here and hit ourselves in the head with hammers.
[01:34:28.156 --> 01:34:29.698]  All right.
[01:34:32.079 --> 01:34:33.060]  I'm going to shut up now.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.442]  As soon as you hear callers hang up, I want farmers to call in.
[01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:44.887]  As soon as you hear a caller hang up, only farmers after this, ahead of Bob Chapman, 800-259-9231, are you concerned about this?
[01:34:46.168 --> 01:34:54.813]  I'll guarantee you, we couldn't even afford the tractors we've got if we were being harassed by the feds and they were there asking about the brake pads and giving us fines with the truck police.
[01:34:55.934 --> 01:34:58.756]  This is just a new revenue stream for the parasites.
[01:35:01.664 --> 01:35:06.487]  They're going after your farms, they're going after your gardens, they're going after your farmers' markets.
[01:35:06.547 --> 01:35:09.509]  I've seen the new forms they tell people to sign for farmers' markets.
[01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:13.211]  They're like 15 pages long, waiving all your rights.
[01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:14.492]  This country's a joke!
[01:35:14.932 --> 01:35:17.974]  And it's time for farmers and others to stop obeying the law.
[01:35:18.014 --> 01:35:30.382]  We are getting to the point that when the Nazi-stinking, foreign banker-occupied government tells us we're going to stick their hands down our pants, or they're going to not let us grow tomatoes, or they're going to arrest Amish, it's time to start getting angry.
[01:35:31.462 --> 01:35:34.064]  And that's why the Feds paid all those rioters to do what they did.
[01:35:34.084 --> 01:35:38.627]  It's coming out, it was staged, to demonize any real rioting as evil.
[01:35:39.848 --> 01:35:43.151]  Alright, finish up what you were saying, Steve, instead of talking about Beth.
[01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:44.072]  You got anything else to add?
[01:35:45.132 --> 01:35:45.593]  Yes, I do.
[01:35:45.633 --> 01:35:48.495]  Top of the list, Alex, is the CDL.
[01:35:49.002 --> 01:35:54.226]  In New York, CDLs are $180 for five years, and you must have a physical every year at $400.
[01:35:54.366 --> 01:35:55.927]  Okay?
[01:35:56.247 --> 01:35:57.508]  That's the quick one.
[01:35:57.608 --> 01:35:59.449]  And you gotta jump through 500 hoops.
[01:35:59.549 --> 01:36:01.511]  I mean, it's super hard to get a concealed carry.
[01:36:02.491 --> 01:36:03.572]  Yeah.
[01:36:03.992 --> 01:36:05.113]  Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
[01:36:05.213 --> 01:36:07.014]  You're talking about a commercial driver's license.
[01:36:07.034 --> 01:36:07.555]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:36:07.655 --> 01:36:07.915]  Right.
[01:36:08.495 --> 01:36:08.735]  Right.
[01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:09.956]  The commercial driver's license.
[01:36:10.517 --> 01:36:11.237]  Because I have one.
[01:36:11.277 --> 01:36:12.318]  I know what it takes to get one.
[01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:18.022]  Well, what about how you put yourself under the harassing jurisdiction once you have one?
[01:36:19.258 --> 01:36:21.800]  Oh yeah, that goes without saying.
[01:36:23.502 --> 01:36:31.689]  You have to submit the polygraph, you have to take your own test, and you've got to be careful that they don't slip an RFD into you.
[01:36:33.611 --> 01:36:36.573]  Oh yeah, all over the country they're making you take tracker chips to be able to do it.
[01:36:36.973 --> 01:36:38.054]  I appreciate your call, Steve.
[01:36:38.074 --> 01:36:41.137]  We're going to go to more calls now and try to move quickly, which means snail pace.
[01:36:41.798 --> 01:36:44.180]  Marie in Indiana, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:36:45.609 --> 01:36:47.711]  Hi Alex, God bless you from the Hoosier land.
[01:36:47.731 --> 01:36:49.452]  Thank you.
[01:36:49.532 --> 01:36:57.399]  I'm an organic grower who's getting the hell kicked out of me by SB-510 and watching with growing alarm Farmageddon.
[01:36:57.819 --> 01:36:58.460]  And now this?
[01:36:59.501 --> 01:37:00.101]  The Farm Bill?
[01:37:00.121 --> 01:37:05.226]  Do you have any teenagers help their fathers and grandfathers on the farm that won't be able to qualify for CDL?
[01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:11.911]  Listen, I used to go work on the neighboring ranch because they would hire me many summers.
[01:37:12.351 --> 01:37:13.653]  And I remember being 12 years old.
[01:37:13.673 --> 01:37:14.813]  I already knew how to drive a tractor.
[01:37:14.833 --> 01:37:16.915]  And they said, go out and shred all those fields.
[01:37:17.696 --> 01:37:19.697]  And I mean, it's easy to drive a tractor.
[01:37:20.138 --> 01:37:20.678]  Exactly.
[01:37:20.778 --> 01:37:21.219]  It's over.
[01:37:21.579 --> 01:37:23.200]  It'll kill family farming.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:24.281]  It's designed to.
[01:37:24.321 --> 01:37:25.082]  But it's not even that.
[01:37:25.402 --> 01:37:29.365]  What about a federal jurisdiction now on your farm?
[01:37:29.405 --> 01:37:31.207]  I mean, there's no end to it.
[01:37:32.665 --> 01:37:34.727]  Yeah, I mean, is that when I pull... I mean, what do you do?
[01:37:34.767 --> 01:37:35.708]  How do we stop this?
[01:37:35.788 --> 01:37:36.869]  I mean, we call Senators.
[01:37:37.309 --> 01:37:41.653]  Evan Mai's mailbox has been full, both in email and voicemail, for over a year.
[01:37:41.713 --> 01:37:43.254]  You can't even give that man feedback.
[01:37:43.815 --> 01:37:44.756]  What do we do?
[01:37:44.916 --> 01:37:46.297]  Well, by the way, they know you're angry.
[01:37:46.337 --> 01:37:48.980]  That's why they're getting rid of Congress and setting up a super Congress and...
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:52.621]  I saw a Daily Mail article going, look how great the U.S.
[01:37:52.681 --> 01:37:55.102]  NORTHCOM plan is for martial law.
[01:37:55.142 --> 01:37:58.324]  If they have riots, the regular armies called out.
[01:37:58.424 --> 01:38:01.865]  No, the National Guard would have been, but they're now federalized.
[01:38:02.165 --> 01:38:05.306]  And in a riot, they're not going to come help you, a.k.a.
[01:38:05.707 --> 01:38:06.207]  New Orleans.
[01:38:06.227 --> 01:38:07.667]  They're going to come take your guns.
[01:38:09.028 --> 01:38:09.508]  Amen.
[01:38:09.588 --> 01:38:11.749]  I lived and worked in New Orleans for several years.
[01:38:11.809 --> 01:38:13.250]  I watched that whole debacle unfold.
[01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:15.911]  And they were just disarming old ladies trying to protect their homes.
[01:38:16.738 --> 01:38:24.544]  They would go into high and dry areas to see if they could get away with it, and they did a big test, a big drill, to see if the military would take the guns.
[01:38:24.684 --> 01:38:26.825]  And in almost all cases, they did.
[01:38:27.205 --> 01:38:30.568]  And they would knock on the door, somebody would open it up, even in the wealthiest area.
[01:38:30.828 --> 01:38:32.049]  They targeted the wealthiest.
[01:38:32.429 --> 01:38:34.990]  To set that precedent, because they can do it to them, they can do it to anybody.
[01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:38.070]  And it's on the news, pridefully on ABC News.
[01:38:38.451 --> 01:38:39.991]  They come to the door, and it's like, yes, sir.
[01:38:40.011 --> 01:38:41.271]  They're like, get over here.
[01:38:41.571 --> 01:38:41.931]  Boom!
[01:38:41.951 --> 01:38:42.612]  Put them on the ground.
[01:38:42.872 --> 01:38:43.392]  Handcuffs.
[01:38:43.432 --> 01:38:43.812]  Go in.
[01:38:44.232 --> 01:38:45.212]  Blow the safe open.
[01:38:45.292 --> 01:38:46.092]  Steal the guns.
[01:38:46.573 --> 01:38:48.293]  And the people are just sitting there on the concrete.
[01:38:48.753 --> 01:38:49.053]  U.S.
[01:38:49.153 --> 01:38:51.094]  Army loads it up under FBI command.
[01:38:51.414 --> 01:38:51.874]  Pull out.
[01:38:52.154 --> 01:38:53.354]  Just truckloads of guns.
[01:38:53.654 --> 01:38:55.515]  And they can't wait to do it.
[01:38:55.995 --> 01:38:56.615]  And you know what?
[01:38:56.835 --> 01:38:57.995]  The people did what they were told.
[01:38:58.035 --> 01:38:58.816]  Nobody fought back.
[01:38:58.856 --> 01:38:59.576]  And the Fed said,
[01:39:00.296 --> 01:39:01.578]  This is going to work really well.
[01:39:02.158 --> 01:39:10.888]  Why shouldn't they say, hey, you've got to get a commercial driver's license and go under inspection and have log books to have a tractor on your farm?
[01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:13.651]  Most people are going to bend over and beg for it.
[01:39:14.744 --> 01:39:16.205]  I use big equipment in my business.
[01:39:16.245 --> 01:39:19.748]  I've owned and operated a landscaping and lawn mowing business for 16 years.
[01:39:20.388 --> 01:39:21.109]  What's next?
[01:39:21.129 --> 01:39:22.510]  I mean, why not CDLS?
[01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:27.573]  I operate a big old six-foot wide, very dangerous, in the wrong hands, ride-on mower.
[01:39:27.833 --> 01:39:28.854]  No, no, no, no, ma'am, ma'am.
[01:39:29.034 --> 01:39:29.975]  Those are under this.
[01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:32.977]  All riding mowers, everything is under this.
[01:39:33.017 --> 01:39:33.978]  Anything with an engine.
[01:39:35.393 --> 01:39:38.716]  I know, there goes hiring high school kids for the summer to operate the equipment.
[01:39:38.936 --> 01:39:42.119]  Well, if you didn't know, well, you can't have folks have responsibility.
[01:39:42.499 --> 01:39:43.580]  Something might happen to them.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.203]  See, this is the nanny state, but it's not about protecting you.
[01:39:46.263 --> 01:39:49.205]  It's about mega corporations taking everything over.
[01:39:50.046 --> 01:39:50.687]  Absolutely.
[01:39:50.767 --> 01:39:53.949]  I mean, I remember working on a golf course for a summer.
[01:39:54.029 --> 01:39:57.392]  I worked at Great Hills here in Austin, right out of high school.
[01:39:57.973 --> 01:40:00.595]  And I got there.
[01:40:01.721 --> 01:40:04.682]  They gave me a job, and they said, I heard you know how to drive a tractor.
[01:40:04.702 --> 01:40:05.563]  Go shred this.
[01:40:06.443 --> 01:40:07.083]  Go do that.
[01:40:07.724 --> 01:40:09.084]  And that was the end of it.
[01:40:09.124 --> 01:40:10.405]  But no, no.
[01:40:10.705 --> 01:40:12.346]  But see, it's not just the license.
[01:40:12.486 --> 01:40:15.587]  It's the harassment, the log books on your property.
[01:40:16.647 --> 01:40:18.868]  And look at how they're attacking organic farmers right now.
[01:40:20.009 --> 01:40:22.270]  What's your view as an organic farmer, Maria, of this government?
[01:40:24.231 --> 01:40:28.773]  I think they're stopping us out so we can all eat GMO food from Dow and Monsanto forever and ever.
[01:40:28.833 --> 01:40:29.253]  Amen.
[01:40:29.944 --> 01:40:30.485]  Absolutely.
[01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:31.185]  Thank you for the call.
[01:40:31.205 --> 01:40:32.306]  No, that's what they admit they're doing.
[01:40:32.846 --> 01:40:34.087]  They're all exempt from everything.
[01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:36.389]  Let's talk to Valerie in Alaska.
[01:40:36.409 --> 01:40:36.769]  Welcome.
[01:40:36.789 --> 01:40:38.751]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:39.211 --> 01:40:40.372]  I listen to you all day.
[01:40:41.293 --> 01:40:42.494]  My kids can attest to that.
[01:40:42.994 --> 01:40:50.700]  Anyway, I used to live in California, and my dad, he always had farm equipment around our place.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.581]  He always had Al-Qaeda equipment.
[01:40:54.143 --> 01:40:58.486]  And I learned, you know, when I was 12 years old, how to drive a little four-tractor to clean out our horse pens.
[01:40:59.111 --> 01:41:11.575]  Anyway, this makes me sick, but anyway, what I wanted to get into really quickly is, they always call me the ideal lady, and when I lived in California and I moved up to Alaska to get away from California, because, you know, we ended up with
[01:41:14.188 --> 01:41:27.477]  Uh, the enforcement team down there, they're always coming on our place, you know, uh, trying to give us the, you know, these tickets on, well, you didn't do this, you didn't do that, and we just got tired of it and ended up going to Alaska.
[01:41:27.917 --> 01:41:32.580]  But anyway, um, it cost us thousands of dollars down there, and we said, forget it, let's leave.
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:35.902]  Um, so we came up here where there's a lot more freedom.
[01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:41.546]  But what I wanted to, uh, get into, uh, is, uh, four years ago when I found your show,
[01:41:42.604 --> 01:41:43.904]  I decided to do something.
[01:41:44.024 --> 01:41:58.828]  I've known about the New World Order for 40 years and I even met Alex, I mean I even met Dan Smoot and a lot of the people that did Nundick House conspiracy.
[01:41:58.908 --> 01:42:02.269]  Oh yeah, he was out of Dallas with that report.
[01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:06.810]  He was an FBI agent who retired so he could expose the New World Order.
[01:42:07.574 --> 01:42:08.355]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:08.715 --> 01:42:15.181]  And, and, and the Nondera Collison Seriousty Book, I gave out about a hundred of those when I was, you know, a teenager and things like that to get the word out.
[01:42:15.201 --> 01:42:19.325]  But what I'm doing today, or what I've been doing for the last four years up here,
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:28.027]  I think just about everybody in Alaska knows about you, but what I've done, and anybody can do this, this idea.
[01:42:28.087 --> 01:42:40.417]  Now I've done it from California all the way up to Alaska and back, and I've gone to every, you know, like Walmart and I've gone to like Disneyland and places like this.
[01:42:40.877 --> 01:42:44.280]  What I've done is, now anyone can do this, is you can take a piece of paper,
[01:42:44.964 --> 01:42:45.324]  I'm good.
[01:43:05.578 --> 01:43:08.059]  I just put down who I want people to look up.
[01:43:08.199 --> 01:43:14.261]  Yeah, a lot of people do little cards and they'll say InfoWars.com, Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception.
[01:43:14.281 --> 01:43:15.041]  They're very cheap.
[01:43:15.361 --> 01:43:22.424]  You can even print them out on regular printer paper that's incredibly inexpensive and then use a paper cutter to cut them up.
[01:43:22.444 --> 01:43:27.185]  You can print on both sides and then just hand them out and say, hey, key info, check out this info.
[01:43:27.526 --> 01:43:28.526]  It deals with the economy.
[01:43:28.566 --> 01:43:31.147]  Hey, this is some forbidden news information.
[01:43:31.707 --> 01:43:34.750]  And it's having a giant effect, and that's what scares the system.
[01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:37.253]  Valerie, great to hear from you from Alaska.
[01:43:38.054 --> 01:43:39.275]  Let's continue with the calls.
[01:43:40.055 --> 01:43:41.237]  That's what's scaring the system.
[01:43:41.637 --> 01:43:45.101]  And even if they try to shut the web down or shut me up, they can't shut you up.
[01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:46.422]  You are the power.
[01:43:46.902 --> 01:43:48.023]  You have the truth.
[01:43:48.524 --> 01:43:49.805]  You have the initiative.
[01:43:50.266 --> 01:43:53.088]  And listen, all over the country,
[01:43:54.093 --> 01:43:57.855]  Everywhere I go now, people, the majority of them, know who I am.
[01:43:58.636 --> 01:44:00.677]  And again, that isn't who Alex Jones is big.
[01:44:01.438 --> 01:44:03.879]  That is the people are awake.
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:10.883]  The last shoe to drop is that people don't know that the majority of us are awake to some extent.
[01:44:12.084 --> 01:44:16.027]  Most folks aren't fully awake, and they also don't see themselves as leaders.
[01:44:16.587 --> 01:44:17.828]  You are the leaders.
[01:44:18.228 --> 01:44:20.850]  You should be flooding your police departments right now.
[01:44:21.983 --> 01:44:22.923]  And your county sheriffs.
[01:44:23.463 --> 01:44:25.904]  And saying it's not your job to do whatever the feds say.
[01:44:26.324 --> 01:44:30.766]  Don't you come down to my house in the next year if this goes through and harass me over my tractor.
[01:44:30.786 --> 01:44:35.627]  Because it'll be a Sunday morning and you'll be out there and you'll hear a knock, knock, knock.
[01:44:35.987 --> 01:44:38.648]  And it'll be the local truck police under a federal grant.
[01:44:39.468 --> 01:44:42.229]  Sorry, Mr. Johnson, we need to look at your tractor.
[01:44:42.269 --> 01:44:45.470]  It's part of the new... Did you get the license like you were supposed to?
[01:44:46.090 --> 01:44:49.531]  I'm gonna give you a warning this time, but if you don't have it in a month, I'm coming back.
[01:44:50.071 --> 01:44:51.592]  You're like, I knew your daddy!
[01:44:51.612 --> 01:44:53.553]  We were in World War II, boy!
[01:44:53.573 --> 01:44:54.514]  I ain't gonna get nothing!
[01:44:54.874 --> 01:44:56.295]  Now, I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.
[01:44:56.315 --> 01:44:57.155]  We're gonna come back.
[01:44:57.715 --> 01:45:01.818]  And if Mr. Johnson fights back, they're gonna call the SWAT team and they're gonna kill Mr. Johnson.
[01:45:02.298 --> 01:45:04.079]  And they're gonna call Mr. Johnson a terrorist.
[01:45:04.499 --> 01:45:05.820]  And they're gonna make examples of him.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.761]  They do it all the time.
[01:45:07.521 --> 01:45:14.265]  Mr. Johnson has got to get with the Volunteer Fire Department and the rest of whoever cares about this country and your area.
[01:45:14.565 --> 01:45:16.987]  You got to get together now, okay?
[01:45:17.647 --> 01:45:20.289]  You can't just go, oh Alex, we like him.
[01:45:20.729 --> 01:45:22.590]  He's talking about it on the radio.
[01:45:23.311 --> 01:45:24.632]  We're going into a depression.
[01:45:25.592 --> 01:45:27.974]  And they're going to use this thing to fully end this country.
[01:45:28.214 --> 01:45:29.975]  This is the end of America.
[01:45:30.315 --> 01:45:32.056]  This is the fall of the Republic.
[01:45:32.817 --> 01:45:33.377]  It's here.
[01:45:33.557 --> 01:45:34.118]  It's coming.
[01:45:34.158 --> 01:45:35.238]  It's going to get crazier.
[01:45:35.879 --> 01:45:36.059]  So,
[01:45:38.533 --> 01:45:41.175]  Get dug in now, but also reach out to people.
[01:45:42.316 --> 01:45:42.656]  Okay?
[01:45:43.177 --> 01:45:44.558]  Dig in, reach out.
[01:45:44.878 --> 01:45:47.260]  You dig in for yourself, then you go reach out.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.362]  You get your house in order, then you reach out.
[01:45:49.662 --> 01:45:50.803]  Dig in, reach out.
[01:45:51.564 --> 01:45:58.089]  Let's go to John in Florida, then Watchman, and Ezekiel, Mark, got a bunch of farmers now.
[01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:59.630]  Oh, Watchman just hung up.
[01:45:59.710 --> 01:46:03.553]  Okay, let's go to John in Florida, and then Ezekiel.
[01:46:03.573 --> 01:46:04.094]  Go ahead, John.
[01:46:04.844 --> 01:46:06.746]  Hi Alex, I'm a long time fan.
[01:46:06.786 --> 01:46:08.427]  I've been listening for at least five years.
[01:46:08.727 --> 01:46:12.170]  This is my second time calling in and I have just three questions to ask you.
[01:46:12.931 --> 01:46:18.136]  Number one is I hear you speaking a lot about derivatives and I don't really have a strong understanding as to what they are.
[01:46:18.156 --> 01:46:19.977]  Can you give a short answer as to what they are?
[01:46:20.938 --> 01:46:22.720]  Yes, well there's a whole different
[01:46:23.735 --> 01:46:26.957]  Classes, credit default swaps, you name it.
[01:46:26.997 --> 01:46:34.982]  But they basically create pools of mortgages and then invest on the overall outcome of those deals.
[01:46:35.242 --> 01:46:41.627]  Then they put fake mortgages into those or have part of a mortgage and then claim they own the rest of it.
[01:46:42.067 --> 01:46:48.071]  And then they sell insurance on it and then they trade that insurance as if it's another financial instrument.
[01:46:48.091 --> 01:46:51.293]  We cover it all in Fall of the Republic and Obama deception.
[01:46:54.055 --> 01:46:57.958]  Banks create bonds.
[01:46:57.978 --> 01:47:03.923]  I mean, there's all sorts of different ones, but basically, it's junk bonds that have no value.
[01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:08.186]  I got another question for you.
[01:47:08.346 --> 01:47:16.953]  The people that push the carbon taxes, what do they say they're going to do with the money to improve the environment, and what will they actually really be doing with the money?
[01:47:17.549 --> 01:47:17.929]  Nothing.
[01:47:17.949 --> 01:47:19.811]  In fact, it's not even really about the tax.
[01:47:20.432 --> 01:47:22.093]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:47:22.113 --> 01:47:23.655]  I mean, that's part of it.
[01:47:23.695 --> 01:47:27.638]  But the biggest part is the regulators decide who to enforce on.
[01:47:28.399 --> 01:47:29.440]  And they don't even care now.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:39.609]  They just give all the insiders waivers, and then you don't get a waiver, and then you can't compete because the people that get the waivers can bring the product to people 20, 30, 40 percent cheaper.
[01:47:42.495 --> 01:47:44.016]  It's all about inside baseball.
[01:47:44.717 --> 01:47:48.841]  The big mega banks move finance factories in China with Fortune 100.
[01:47:49.602 --> 01:47:53.826]  They get tax incentives written to where they get paid to move to China.
[01:47:54.606 --> 01:47:58.310]  But then if your small company wants to go move to China, you're not going to be allowed in.
[01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:08.219]  Or, if you try to operate here, you're under all these regulations that the big corporations that move to China lobby to get passed to shut you down so you can't compete.
[01:48:11.414 --> 01:48:12.955]  Yeah, that's a real bummer there, huh?
[01:48:13.136 --> 01:48:14.217]  Yeah, that's the new world order.
[01:48:14.237 --> 01:48:15.037]  That's globalism.
[01:48:15.077 --> 01:48:21.263]  That's Al Gore saying this is a good deal, Larry, on Larry King Live in 94.
[01:48:21.663 --> 01:48:23.084]  Saying how great Naftan Gatt would be.
[01:48:23.505 --> 01:48:24.165]  Who was right?
[01:48:24.265 --> 01:48:25.186]  Giant sucking sound.
[01:48:25.286 --> 01:48:25.707]  It happened.
[01:48:26.047 --> 01:48:27.468]  You think you've been hurt so far?
[01:48:27.628 --> 01:48:28.569]  We've seen nothing.
[01:48:28.829 --> 01:48:37.257]  They're gonna assault every business, every farm, every ranch, every restaurant, every car dealership that is not a big heavy.
[01:48:38.248 --> 01:48:38.588]  Okay?
[01:48:39.369 --> 01:48:43.311]  This is why the founders finally said, I'm just ready to die than live like this.
[01:48:44.052 --> 01:48:45.432]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[01:48:45.693 --> 01:48:46.813]  All the same bull.
[01:48:47.714 --> 01:48:50.215]  They tried for decades to be left alone.
[01:48:50.455 --> 01:48:52.036]  They tried every avenue.
[01:48:54.238 --> 01:48:56.959]  Let's go to Ezekiel, who's a farmer in Kentucky.
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.681]  That would be called a terrorist in Kentucky.
[01:49:00.201 --> 01:49:00.782]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:49:02.783 --> 01:49:07.806]  Hey, I want to talk real quick about the Kentucky's WIC and food stamp program.
[01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:13.636]  Uh, because I have, you know, unfortunately, in a bad situation where I have to apply and use that stuff.
[01:49:13.676 --> 01:49:22.846]  But, um, you can buy junk food and preservative-ridden TV dinners with food assistance, but you can't buy organic milk and cheese and other organic products.
[01:49:22.886 --> 01:49:24.888]  Because they're not part of the big corporate morgue.
[01:49:25.108 --> 01:49:25.829]  Absolutely not.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:30.803]  The state wants the poor to be sick, sick and unhealthy, because they profit off of it.
[01:49:30.823 --> 01:49:32.525]  And that's why health food is so expensive.
[01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:33.445]  I'm sick of it!
[01:49:33.846 --> 01:49:35.767]  Hey, let me ask you this, Ezekiel.
[01:49:36.288 --> 01:49:42.192]  How's it going to be when you've got feds coming on the land you're farming and inspecting and harassing everything?
[01:49:42.452 --> 01:49:44.534]  I guess there are jurisdictions everywhere now.
[01:49:45.895 --> 01:49:46.336]  Of course.
[01:49:46.696 --> 01:49:47.917]  Yes, it's going on in Kentucky.
[01:49:48.836 --> 01:49:56.120]  I grew up on a farm, but we lost our farm, and I have to live in an apartment now, but I still work on a farm, and I hear about it all the time.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.281]  Oh, but you're a dirty American.
[01:49:58.321 --> 01:49:59.882]  You're not willing to work on a farm.
[01:50:00.102 --> 01:50:05.185]  That's why we gotta have 30 million illegals to undercut all the wages, because you're too lazy.
[01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:06.306]  I hear this every day.
[01:50:06.346 --> 01:50:07.246]  It's a bunch of bull.
[01:50:08.407 --> 01:50:08.587]  Yeah.
[01:50:10.576 --> 01:50:27.871]  And by the way, the Feds are announcing that they're looking at the Irish model of if you get any assistance, even though you're working and can't survive without the soup line, that's what it is, a digital soup line, and don't feel bad, it's happened to, you know, you name it,
[01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:33.668]  You're going to be forced to take inoculations and your children if you want the food.
[01:50:34.008 --> 01:50:38.411]  See, it's all about bankrupting, all about using the third world to leverage us out.
[01:50:38.671 --> 01:50:46.476]  The prison labor, millions working for 25 cents an hour or less as slave labor, that's to drive down wages, to bankrupt you into government control.
[01:50:47.276 --> 01:50:50.420]  The Chinese slave labor, the taxes on top of businesses.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:52.363]  So even if you try to compete, you can't.
[01:50:52.703 --> 01:50:53.864]  Just every angle.
[01:50:53.965 --> 01:50:57.129]  Total global economic military takeover.
[01:50:57.589 --> 01:51:00.613]  And now the feds are coming to your funds.
[01:51:00.893 --> 01:51:01.674]  Now they're coming.
[01:51:02.552 --> 01:51:05.755]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:51:06.095 --> 01:51:11.499]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:51:12.119 --> 01:51:12.440]  Why?
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.743]  When you can be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[01:54:10.366 --> 01:54:12.907]  We're shooting down their global warming propaganda.
[01:54:13.847 --> 01:54:17.468]  And they're still rolling forward with the fraud, but we're going to expose that now and defeat it.
[01:54:18.128 --> 01:54:20.829]  And appeals court strikes down health insurance requirement.
[01:54:20.849 --> 01:54:31.632]  A federal appeals court, this just came out minutes ago, has struck down the requirement in President Barack Obama's health care overall package that virtually all Americans must carry health insurance or face penalties.
[01:54:31.652 --> 01:54:36.213]  Of course, no one ever challenged it on the fact that he's given waivers out, and that's discriminatory.
[01:54:36.253 --> 01:54:37.273]  That's the way to get rid of it.
[01:54:37.973 --> 01:54:46.640]  A divided three-judge panel in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday struck down the so-called individual mandate, siding with 26 states that had sued to block the law.
[01:54:47.141 --> 01:54:52.685]  But the decision didn't go as far as lower court that had invalidated the entire overhaul as unconstitutional.
[01:54:53.206 --> 01:54:55.187]  I'll give you more on that with Bob Chapman coming up.
[01:54:55.948 --> 01:55:07.202]  Before I go back to Mark in Maine who's a farmer, Roger in Missouri who's a farmer, John in PA who's a farmer, Freedom in Texas who's an evil farmer, and Bill, an even more evil farmer in North Dakota.
[01:55:08.303 --> 01:55:10.967]  I want to show you, they got FBI training.
[01:55:12.168 --> 01:55:13.248]  Flyers going out everywhere.
[01:55:13.928 --> 01:55:16.029]  To gun shops, hair salons, you name it.
[01:55:16.469 --> 01:55:20.130]  And they say in these things, if somebody's talking about freedom, call the FBI on them.
[01:55:20.590 --> 01:55:30.052]  And this latest one, Feds Send Terrorist Handout to Military Surplus Stores, and we've got a copy of it, and it says, are they concerned about the government?
[01:55:30.212 --> 01:55:31.693]  Are they buying MREs?
[01:55:32.473 --> 01:55:33.353]  Meals Ready to Eat?
[01:55:33.693 --> 01:55:35.314]  Go ahead and call the Feds on them.
[01:55:37.737 --> 01:55:48.705]  I've tried to call these phone numbers they've got on these flyers, and it usually just goes to voicemail, but if they pick up, you go, yeah, I'd like to report Anwar al-Awlaki, number three in Al-Qaeda, is hanging out secretly at the Pentagon.
[01:55:49.246 --> 01:55:52.668]  I'd like to tell you about, sir, we can't take this report.
[01:55:53.129 --> 01:55:55.450]  No, really, I want to report actually who the terrorists are.
[01:55:57.532 --> 01:56:04.817]  I want to report the ATF caught shipping tens of thousands of guns into Mexico and Illinois and Miami to drug gangs.
[01:56:05.796 --> 01:56:06.656]  To then blame us?
[01:56:06.796 --> 01:56:08.036]  Sorry, we can't take this report.
[01:56:08.076 --> 01:56:08.637]  That's right.
[01:56:09.097 --> 01:56:12.537]  You know full well who the narcotics trafficking, murdering terrorists are.
[01:56:12.857 --> 01:56:20.339]  And it's the people that run this criminal, stinking government, who now are going to have you fill out road logs and drug tests.
[01:56:20.459 --> 01:56:21.599]  Oh yeah, that's in there.
[01:56:21.619 --> 01:56:23.059]  It's in the mainstream news.
[01:56:23.319 --> 01:56:30.421]  And inspections of farms and ranches of any motorized vehicle used in gardening, farming, or ranching, including riding lawnmowers.
[01:56:30.721 --> 01:56:31.421]  And guess what?
[01:56:31.661 --> 01:56:34.462]  In a separate report, they're getting ready to go after the RVs.
[01:56:34.782 --> 01:56:36.523]  Are you going to pull a pop-up behind you?
[01:56:36.603 --> 01:56:37.924]  No, you're not, scum!
[01:56:38.464 --> 01:56:39.805]  No, you're not, scum!
[01:56:40.065 --> 01:56:43.987]  You're pulling off at the little roadway checkpoint to be searched without a warrant now.
[01:56:44.467 --> 01:56:45.867]  You're going to have a transponder.
[01:56:46.087 --> 01:56:47.288]  You're going to pay taxes.
[01:56:47.508 --> 01:56:52.530]  You're going to bend over, but the Mexican trucks are going to be above it, because it's New World Order time.
[01:56:52.971 --> 01:56:54.771]  All right, Mark in Maine, farmer.
[01:56:55.051 --> 01:56:56.492]  You're on the air, Evil One.
[01:56:56.512 --> 01:56:56.952]  Go ahead.
[01:56:56.972 --> 01:56:58.113]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:58.533 --> 01:56:59.013]  How you doing?
[01:56:59.173 --> 01:56:59.754]  I'm doing all right.
[01:56:59.774 --> 01:57:00.454]  What do you think of this?
[01:57:01.092 --> 01:57:06.296]  Well hey, you know what, up here in Maine we were successful in fighting the animal ID and premise ID by one vote.
[01:57:06.997 --> 01:57:12.061]  One vote it went down when they tried to push it down from the feds to the state.
[01:57:12.121 --> 01:57:20.769]  Maine fought back and Maine is fighting back also with local food ordinance that some of the towns up here have adopted saying that the small local farmer
[01:57:22.684 --> 01:57:32.332]  Good, I love you, and I'm aware of that.
[01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:44.102]  Texas was the only state, before it was even law, to worshipfully implement the Real ID, premises ID, that literally hands your property over to the feds, no rights, no nothing.
[01:57:44.362 --> 01:57:48.766]  Texas was like, our legislature was like, we love it, give it to us.
[01:57:49.697 --> 01:57:55.642]  Because we're Texans and we wear cowboy hats, so there ain't no tyranny, so we'll just accept it!
[01:57:56.604 --> 01:58:01.448]  Yeah, well even more than that, we have a candidate up here who's running for U.S.
[01:58:01.508 --> 01:58:10.195]  Senate in the Republican primary against Olympia Snowe, and he has made a cornerstone of his campaign to protect a small local farmer.
[01:58:10.996 --> 01:58:18.162]  And his name is Scott Dambois, and I'm one of his county commissioners up here trying to get him on the map.
[01:58:18.182 --> 01:58:19.984]  They're ignoring him like they are Ron Paul.
[01:58:20.703 --> 01:58:30.306]  But he has told me that the first bill that he is going to introduce, if elected to the Senate, will be a bill to repeal the Food Safety Act, S-510.
[01:58:31.927 --> 01:58:36.789]  Now, they only passed parts of S-510, but they didn't pass the really... We'll be right back.
[01:58:36.849 --> 01:58:37.529]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:37.569 --> 01:58:38.009]  Good news.
[01:58:38.049 --> 01:58:40.710]  More farmers, more evil food growers.

[02:00:35.584 --> 02:00:41.887]  I haven't even gotten into mainstream media reporting on the NORTHCOM Marshall Law Plan for the U.S.
[02:00:41.927 --> 02:00:42.767]  That's coming up.
[02:00:43.727 --> 02:00:47.269]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to another farmers.
[02:00:47.889 --> 02:00:50.170]  The feds are saying, we have a new rule for you.
[02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:54.712]  You can comment on it, but you know, you can you can comment on what
[02:00:56.161 --> 02:01:06.203]  What kind of uniform the firing squads will be wearing to put you under commercial driver status, which means inspections, harassment, all of it.
[02:01:07.564 --> 02:01:09.404]  Let's talk to Roger in Missouri.
[02:01:09.464 --> 02:01:10.504]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:01:10.544 --> 02:01:10.864]  Welcome.
[02:01:11.945 --> 02:01:12.245]  Yeah.
[02:01:12.325 --> 02:01:13.325]  How you doing today, Alex?
[02:01:13.745 --> 02:01:13.885]  Good.
[02:01:13.905 --> 02:01:14.765]  What do you think about this?
[02:01:16.586 --> 02:01:19.886]  Well, I don't know about the other farmers in their area.
[02:01:19.986 --> 02:01:22.387]  I live in southeast Missouri and
[02:01:24.424 --> 02:01:33.652]  Already, I've been contacted by about five or six farmers about getting together and getting prepared for what's coming.
[02:01:34.513 --> 02:01:44.582]  I feel like I'm walking around with a target on my back because I'm a disabled Marine, I'm a landowner, I don't owe a penny on my land, and I'm a self-sufficient farmer.
[02:01:45.043 --> 02:01:47.385]  Oh, they're the number one evil!
[02:01:49.508 --> 02:01:59.336]  But, uh, around here, even the guys, it's not prior military and everything, uh, uh, we got a sheriff that doesn't help the feds.
[02:01:59.776 --> 02:02:01.778]  He doesn't go against them, but he doesn't help them.
[02:02:02.639 --> 02:02:11.626]  Uh, when the, uh, people was coming around for the census, uh, you gotta, you gotta try real hard to get to my house.
[02:02:12.667 --> 02:02:17.591]  And I had two come to my door and I run them off and I went and talked to the sheriff.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:18.400]  Good!
[02:02:32.825 --> 02:02:35.428]  And the judge would not hear my side or their side.
[02:02:35.468 --> 02:02:37.389]  He'd give them a $100 fine, and that was it.
[02:02:37.429 --> 02:02:38.450]  He wouldn't even talk about it.
[02:02:38.590 --> 02:02:39.912]  But he did give them a fine.
[02:02:39.932 --> 02:02:41.053]  Well, you've got to do that.
[02:02:41.093 --> 02:02:42.214]  They're trespassing.
[02:02:42.494 --> 02:02:48.400]  They're lying and saying you've got to fill out all those questions, when all they can do under law is ask you how many people live there.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:50.861]  But let me tell you what happened after I did that.
[02:02:50.881 --> 02:02:54.163]  I have a greenhouse built onto the side of my house to grow stuff in the wintertime.
[02:03:18.493 --> 02:03:28.521]  And I got a visit from a black helicopter that set over my house for about ten minutes and then went outside and scared my horses.
[02:03:28.562 --> 02:03:31.664]  My horses ran through the fence and they got down below the tree line.
[02:03:32.665 --> 02:03:34.527]  And I took a picture of them with my phone.
[02:03:35.748 --> 02:03:43.234]  And I went to the, I went storming into the sheriff's office and he didn't have the slightest idea of what I was talking about.
[02:03:43.254 --> 02:03:43.934]  Well let me stop you.
[02:03:43.954 --> 02:03:44.395]  When I was
[02:03:46.345 --> 02:03:52.387]  Getting involved, trying to block the county buying another ten million dollar German helicopter for the Sheriff's Department.
[02:03:52.727 --> 02:03:57.948]  They went to my parents' house, hovered at tree level, and flipped my mother off.
[02:03:59.108 --> 02:04:06.930]  And then my wife and I, girlfriend at the time, we're married now, got a black helicopter visit with the entire house shaking.
[02:04:07.230 --> 02:04:13.692]  And then they kept coming and visiting, but it wasn't a black helicopter, it was the Sheriff's Department, yellow and blue.
[02:04:14.512 --> 02:04:18.456]  And yes, I've gotten the black helicopter visits, those are federal, and that's what they do.
[02:04:18.516 --> 02:04:22.420]  They want you to know we're harassing you, we're the boss, we're the terrorist.
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.502]  Now, again, so what?
[02:04:24.522 --> 02:04:27.144]  It shows they're criminals, it showed you did the right thing.
[02:04:27.344 --> 02:04:29.146]  Did you ever get another visit from them again?
[02:04:29.987 --> 02:04:38.295]  Well, I was going to tell you, it's sort of funny, when I was standing in my driveway with the gravel and the dirt and everything in my eyes,
[02:04:39.231 --> 02:04:39.772]  Stay there.
[02:04:40.112 --> 02:04:40.953]  I want you to finish.
[02:04:41.514 --> 02:04:45.578]  I want Bob Chapman to hear this story when we get back.
[02:04:45.598 --> 02:04:46.599]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.167 --> 02:05:07.087]  Tyranny is here.
[02:05:07.428 --> 02:05:11.009]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:11.289 --> 02:05:13.610]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:19.033]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:19.453 --> 02:05:25.716]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:26.116 --> 02:05:31.679]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:35.782]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:36.282 --> 02:05:40.305]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:40.565 --> 02:05:46.088]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:46.508 --> 02:05:49.510]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:51.491]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:05:52.052 --> 02:05:52.472]  It's here.

[02:07:01.769 --> 02:07:02.910]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:09.614]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:09.875 --> 02:07:12.156]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:12.416 --> 02:07:17.620]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:20.581]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:20.842 --> 02:07:22.903]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:23.143 --> 02:07:29.087]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:32.610]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:38.314]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:38.574 --> 02:07:39.875]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:40.195 --> 02:07:41.356]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:41.496 --> 02:07:44.018]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:44.178 --> 02:07:48.202]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:48.382 --> 02:07:52.866]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:53.026 --> 02:07:55.469]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:58.591]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:58.611 --> 02:07:59.232]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:08:06.869 --> 02:08:14.897]  If you just joined us, I wanted to hold this collar over a little bit so Bob Chapman formally
[02:08:31.155 --> 02:08:35.418]  Military intelligence and working all over the world can give you his take on it.
[02:08:36.098 --> 02:08:38.660]  But you have to have it actually happen to you to believe it.
[02:08:40.221 --> 02:08:47.085]  If you really anger the feds, they will send a black helicopter.
[02:08:47.105 --> 02:08:49.907]  And then when you talk about it, everybody laughs, even if you videotape it.
[02:08:50.507 --> 02:08:52.808]  And sometimes they'll even drop a firebomb on your house.
[02:08:52.849 --> 02:08:54.670]  There's been a lot of famous cases of that.
[02:08:55.509 --> 02:08:58.532]  A lot of times, people say, oh, there was a fire at your house.
[02:08:58.972 --> 02:09:00.353]  People will see the black helicopter.
[02:09:00.373 --> 02:09:01.494]  They've even done it in Los Angeles.
[02:09:01.514 --> 02:09:07.039]  They'll pull right up, drop a firebomb down your chimney or right on top of your air conditioner and fly off.
[02:09:07.952 --> 02:09:09.072]  I'm not trying to scare people.
[02:09:09.112 --> 02:09:09.972]  These are terrorists.
[02:09:10.833 --> 02:09:12.293]  Now, it isn't your regular military.
[02:09:12.333 --> 02:09:15.774]  They're flying the dark green ones, but they have, and FEMA has under NORTHCOM.
[02:09:16.134 --> 02:09:18.034]  In fact, we have that article ready from the Daily Mail.
[02:09:18.555 --> 02:09:19.875]  I want to put that up on screen.
[02:09:20.375 --> 02:09:23.376]  The Daily Mail talked about something that, in fact, printed for me.
[02:09:23.396 --> 02:09:24.056]  I forgot to print it.
[02:09:24.996 --> 02:09:26.536]  Revealed how the U.S.
[02:09:26.576 --> 02:09:32.338]  would deal with U.K.-style riots by sending the Army to areas with large numbers of minority groups.
[02:09:33.114 --> 02:09:34.655]  And that's how they're selling it to the public.
[02:09:34.755 --> 02:09:35.975]  Oh, it's for the minorities.
[02:09:36.756 --> 02:09:38.377]  And they actually link to another U.S.
[02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:41.098]  newspaper in there that breaks it down.
[02:09:41.118 --> 02:09:42.759]  In fact, print that other link, too, as well.
[02:09:43.199 --> 02:09:53.344]  And then if you scroll down, they give the disinformation that, well, it's in the Constitution under different sections.
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:57.262]  That the regular army deals with insurrection.
[02:09:57.322 --> 02:10:01.506]  No, the militia of the county and the state does, called out by the governor.
[02:10:01.526 --> 02:10:04.609]  But see, now the National Guard has been federalized.
[02:10:04.689 --> 02:10:09.413]  And then lower in the article, it shows a map of North Com.
[02:10:11.309 --> 02:10:14.712]  And that's a public map, and they've got links to U.S.
[02:10:14.752 --> 02:10:20.037]  newspapers admitting, yes, NORTHCOM has military officers over every area of the U.S.
[02:10:20.738 --> 02:10:25.922]  It's under the 10 regions of FEMA, and I'm in Region 6, as you can see there on the map.
[02:10:27.704 --> 02:10:32.729]  And under that system, the military, through the Threat Fusion Centers, takes over the entire society.
[02:10:33.666 --> 02:10:35.027]  And they're not coming with food and water.
[02:10:35.047 --> 02:10:39.311]  They're coming for your firearms, aka Katrina and other areas of the country.
[02:10:39.772 --> 02:10:48.480]  And we've confirmed the military is training in every state of the Union to lock down and cordon and blockade cities and order the firearms turned in.
[02:10:51.778 --> 02:10:54.241]  And if they think they're going to get away with it, they will pull it.
[02:10:54.381 --> 02:10:56.162]  Does that mean the average military person's bad?
[02:10:56.363 --> 02:10:56.623]  No.
[02:10:57.223 --> 02:10:59.586]  But they've shown they will follow orders.
[02:11:00.026 --> 02:11:04.030]  We learned later, and the Fed's kept us quiet, that quite a few units refused in New Orleans.
[02:11:05.231 --> 02:11:06.772]  But many of the units went ahead with it.
[02:11:07.373 --> 02:11:08.994]  And almost all the police agreed.
[02:11:09.295 --> 02:11:12.458]  They brought police in from all over the country under FBI and FEMA command.
[02:11:13.379 --> 02:11:15.501]  So the military was under FBI and FEMA command.
[02:11:16.255 --> 02:11:19.178]  And the FBI guys reportedly loved it.
[02:11:19.278 --> 02:11:22.702]  Dressing up in black outfits and driving around in big flatback trucks.
[02:11:22.742 --> 02:11:26.165]  And they left the rioters and looters and New Orleans cops looting.
[02:11:26.546 --> 02:11:27.647]  They had an enjoyable time.
[02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:30.990]  Anybody trying to get out of the city was peaceful, was shot, of course.
[02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:33.052]  Cops were later convicted of that under orders.
[02:11:34.314 --> 02:11:36.196]  Notice they'll burn you for following orders later.
[02:11:37.751 --> 02:11:38.992]  But I digress now.
[02:11:39.012 --> 02:11:41.114]  We're going to print that article and I'm going to cover it more later.
[02:11:41.734 --> 02:11:46.077]  But I wanted Bob Chapman to be able to comment on what Roger was just saying.
[02:11:46.958 --> 02:11:54.183]  So, Roger, finishing your story, the census folks kept harassing you, coming on your private property, the Buffalo folks.
[02:11:54.484 --> 02:11:55.384]  There's no federal law.
[02:11:55.404 --> 02:11:57.126]  You've got to fill out 50-question forms.
[02:11:57.426 --> 02:11:58.346]  It's called the Fifth Amendment.
[02:11:58.667 --> 02:12:00.588]  So the sheriff, the second time, had him arrested.
[02:12:00.968 --> 02:12:06.553]  And so you got a little black helicopter visit, and you said it was close enough that gravel was hitting you in the face.
[02:12:07.273 --> 02:12:09.795]  And that they had a machine gun on you and flipped you off?
[02:12:10.715 --> 02:12:11.036]  Correct.
[02:12:11.416 --> 02:12:15.239]  I flipped them off first because the gravel was really pelting me.
[02:12:15.379 --> 02:12:17.960]  I mean, they was down below the tree line.
[02:12:18.181 --> 02:12:21.143]  I mean, I would say within 50 foot.
[02:12:21.163 --> 02:12:25.045]  Now you said you're a disabled, retired Marine, farmer who owns his property.
[02:12:25.425 --> 02:12:28.127]  That's scum of the earth according to the communists that run our country.
[02:12:28.568 --> 02:12:29.588]  The banker-run commies.
[02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:33.471]  Was it totally black or was it dark green?
[02:12:33.611 --> 02:12:36.193]  And what service did the personnel look like?
[02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:41.164]  Yeah, they was black and they had black uniforms on.
[02:12:41.184 --> 02:12:42.064]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:12:42.084 --> 02:12:43.745]  There was no markings whatsoever.
[02:12:43.785 --> 02:12:44.405]  That's one thing.
[02:12:44.485 --> 02:12:47.606]  Wow, you got an actual FEMA helicopter visit.
[02:12:47.946 --> 02:12:50.507]  Because NORTHCOM, it's still military, they're just unmarked.
[02:12:51.608 --> 02:12:53.989]  Wow, you got an actual FEMA scum visit.
[02:12:54.909 --> 02:13:02.472]  I really jumped on the sheriff about it because I know that every helicopter, airplane or anything is supposed to have markings on it, have numbers.
[02:13:02.932 --> 02:13:04.353]  And there was none on this one.
[02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:17.995]  But what I want to interject on this, I don't know about other parts of the country, but there's all around my neighbors, my friends, everybody I know that lives in this county, and I don't want to give away too much.
[02:13:18.575 --> 02:13:19.395]  I'll just put it like this.
[02:13:19.455 --> 02:13:20.255]  We're getting prepared.
[02:13:20.375 --> 02:13:31.799]  But like last year, after all the hunting seasons was over and everything, I got to noticing I would be out splitting wood in the afternoon for the night, and I would hear rifle fire.
[02:13:34.019 --> 02:13:35.780]  And, you know, I've been in combat.
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:37.140]  I know what's what.
[02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:39.481]  And it was coming from different directions.
[02:13:39.561 --> 02:13:43.723]  And where I hear where I live, you can hear two or three miles away.
[02:13:44.683 --> 02:13:48.024]  And I know there's other people getting prepared, too.
[02:13:48.705 --> 02:13:52.846]  But we're not experiencing all the stuff that everybody else is.
[02:13:53.306 --> 02:13:54.567]  Maybe it's because we're rural.
[02:13:55.367 --> 02:13:57.888]  But there is a lot of people, and they won't say much.
[02:13:58.908 --> 02:14:01.470]  But they all know what's going on and they're all getting ready.
[02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:07.093]  So when they start trying to come and take our tractors and stuff, I'm afraid.
[02:14:07.774 --> 02:14:14.658]  It's like that song is, I'm not as good as I once was, but I'm as good once as I ever was.
[02:14:15.218 --> 02:14:19.181]  So, you know, when they come around here, I'm afraid they're going to have problems.
[02:14:21.650 --> 02:14:30.132]  Well, absolutely, and that's what it's coming down to, and that's why they're getting everybody ready that anybody who resists being enslaved is a terrorist.
[02:14:30.232 --> 02:14:31.753]  The truth is, they are the terrorist.
[02:14:32.433 --> 02:14:36.914]  They created the Al Qaeda threat to brand terrorism as a pretext to take rights.
[02:14:36.954 --> 02:14:41.876]  Now they're flipping it on to the farmers, the people buying MREs, the returning veterans.
[02:14:42.496 --> 02:14:44.496]  And they are the terrorist, and it's that simple.
[02:14:44.856 --> 02:14:47.797]  And we either expose that, or they win.
[02:14:48.137 --> 02:14:50.358]  And this is the takedown of America, internally.
[02:14:51.328 --> 02:14:56.673]  They're going to get it all lined up and bring in an Al Gore supporting Rick Perry or a socialist Mitt Romney.
[02:14:57.874 --> 02:14:59.895]  And a lot of conservatives are going to lay down to it.
[02:15:00.336 --> 02:15:03.138]  But we've got to understand they own both parties at the top.
[02:15:03.579 --> 02:15:04.699]  They don't own Ron Paul.
[02:15:04.739 --> 02:15:08.343]  That's why they say he can't win, even though he's winning all the big straw polls.
[02:15:08.383 --> 02:15:09.383]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[02:15:09.764 --> 02:15:11.705]  I wanted you to hear that, Bob Chapman.
[02:15:12.486 --> 02:15:41.648]  of the international forecaster dot com uh... because you've been fifty years in this fight and what do you make of the announcements that the feds riding lawnmowers uh... tractors uh... federal uh... transportation a driver's license to get that logs drug test inspections uh... confiscations of any equipment that don't uh... aren't up to their specs i mean you talk about absolute harassment being turned loose on us and that's true
[02:15:42.609 --> 02:15:45.111]  And they finally got around to it.
[02:15:46.532 --> 02:15:48.393]  They've been wanting to do that for many years.
[02:15:50.155 --> 02:15:53.858]  Previously, they usually didn't go to people's homes.
[02:15:55.038 --> 02:16:03.345]  They tried to find out all about them and then find out where they lived.
[02:16:03.925 --> 02:16:08.088]  And sometimes they tried to plant incriminating evidence
[02:16:09.838 --> 02:16:12.899]  But, you know, that was 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.320]  And today, they're right in your face.
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:21.643]  And a good example of what the gentleman had to say is the good example.
[02:16:22.863 --> 02:16:37.169]  I talked to someone who's retiring from a police department, and I told him where he should go to look for a job and how that's doable for him.
[02:16:38.228 --> 02:16:53.721]  And then he told me about someone else who had just retired who had been recruited by a private contractor who is working for the United States government under that contract.
[02:16:54.142 --> 02:17:03.209]  And they're training people for people in crowd control and suppressing people in their own communities and things like that.
[02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:04.711]  And so
[02:17:07.105 --> 02:17:08.925]  That conversation is just two days old.
[02:17:10.206 --> 02:17:18.407]  So the government is definitely getting ready to do some pretty nasty things.
[02:17:19.507 --> 02:17:23.768]  The best thing you can do is try to stay out of harm's way.
[02:17:25.428 --> 02:17:26.708]  Try not to get involved.
[02:17:26.768 --> 02:17:29.469]  This gentleman who was just on, he didn't have much choice.
[02:17:32.049 --> 02:17:33.770]  And he didn't go looking for it.
[02:17:34.470 --> 02:17:36.410]  Quite frankly, I used to go looking for it.
[02:17:37.713 --> 02:17:38.653]  Until they threatened me.
[02:17:39.594 --> 02:17:46.216]  And I knew they were serious because the people who knew them told me they were serious.
[02:17:47.396 --> 02:17:50.697]  And so you've got to be cool.
[02:17:51.918 --> 02:17:55.659]  Prepare yourself more heavily than you would normally.
[02:17:56.399 --> 02:18:02.081]  It's hard living in a rural area where there's not many people around because you're pretty isolated.
[02:18:02.101 --> 02:18:04.642]  And they bring a couple of helicopters in with M60s.
[02:18:06.193 --> 02:18:12.858]  And they unload, uh, 15 to 20 people, uh, you're not going to have much of a chance.
[02:18:14.299 --> 02:18:17.262]  And so, uh, it's hard being out on those areas.
[02:18:17.982 --> 02:18:27.490]  I think, too, that, uh, and you probably have already done this, talk to your friends, neighbors, and try to coordinate things.
[02:18:28.771 --> 02:18:34.495]  I have two-way radios, and, uh... Well, Bob, here's the deal.
[02:18:34.535 --> 02:18:35.376]  If they attack,
[02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:40.183]  The 100 plus million gun owners and 1% fight back, that's a million people.
[02:18:40.964 --> 02:18:44.746]  And, you know, once they start doing more and more of this, people are going to be waiting.
[02:18:45.367 --> 02:18:54.994]  And it's actually a very defendable position, if you don't care what ends up happening at the end of the day, to defend yourself when you're being assaulted by globalist forces.
[02:18:55.575 --> 02:18:58.857]  I mean, look at the force multiplier of the individual.
[02:18:58.917 --> 02:19:02.200]  And plus, if things go into that zone, you don't just sit there and wait for them.
[02:19:05.902 --> 02:19:09.864]  You can go look for them, but you'll have to have a helicopter to do it.
[02:19:12.645 --> 02:19:16.387]  But I say, be sure you get plenty of clips and ammo.
[02:19:16.407 --> 02:19:18.888]  They don't last long in a firefight.
[02:19:19.629 --> 02:19:22.530]  And the man that was just on knows that he's been there and he's done that.
[02:19:23.510 --> 02:19:30.514]  So just have plenty of firepower and make sure everybody in the home fires as good as you do.
[02:19:31.354 --> 02:19:32.795]  But it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:19:35.091 --> 02:19:50.269]  You know, why would government be giving private contractors money to go out and find people who have been somewhat trained in this sort of thing to go into areas
[02:19:51.095 --> 02:19:56.761]  When they're told to, to break up our demonstrations, or go to people's homes, or whatever they're gonna do.
[02:19:56.801 --> 02:19:58.703]  No, they're setting up their secret police.
[02:19:59.604 --> 02:20:01.626]  And it's not gonna be as easy as the scum thinks it is.
[02:20:01.646 --> 02:20:02.147]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:02.167 --> 02:20:03.969]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[02:20:04.069 --> 02:20:06.031]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.
[02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:08.674]  Why, and what can you do to defend your family?

[02:22:01.496 --> 02:22:02.396]  You've been lied to.
[02:22:02.736 --> 02:22:07.558]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.599]  The market is in for another crash.
[02:22:09.899 --> 02:22:15.521]  Real estate is already in a double-dip recession, and if you want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[02:22:16.002 --> 02:22:21.524]  My name is Brett Kitchen, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed, I said enough is enough.
[02:22:22.024 --> 02:22:27.326]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double-digit gains,
[02:22:27.646 --> 02:22:28.207]  We're good to go.

[02:23:57.374 --> 02:23:57.414]  800-332-6784.
[02:24:09.787 --> 02:24:13.330]  There's one thing everybody's got to understand here.
[02:24:35.799 --> 02:24:37.360]  The system wants you dependent.
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:41.461]  They want you bankrupt on welfare and the criminal justice system.
[02:24:42.482 --> 02:24:45.103]  If you're getting out of the military, you're the number one threat.
[02:24:45.123 --> 02:24:49.464]  They absolutely hate your guts because they've trained you to carry out their criminal activity.
[02:24:49.924 --> 02:24:53.046]  They know you've got skills and that you're now awake or could awaken.
[02:24:55.287 --> 02:25:01.349]  And that's why earlier I showed you the news article where when you go into an Army-Navy store,
[02:25:02.915 --> 02:25:13.978]  To buy MREs, they say, that if you criticize the government, or you say you're a survivalist, to call the police on them.
[02:25:16.979 --> 02:25:23.881]  They say if you're buying night vision, weatherized ammunition, that's how a lot of it's sold, is in those cases.
[02:25:25.612 --> 02:25:28.975]  That it says require a valid ID.
[02:25:28.995 --> 02:25:30.636]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:25:30.656 --> 02:25:32.657]  You can buy milk and they'll ask for an ID now.
[02:25:32.917 --> 02:25:37.081]  It's all about getting you ready for the cashless society, global VAT tax.
[02:25:38.001 --> 02:25:41.744]  Now, again, you have to understand about the military and the contractors.
[02:25:41.784 --> 02:25:45.347]  And there's now a million plus private contractors in the U.S.
[02:25:45.447 --> 02:25:46.648]  in domestic intelligence.
[02:25:48.118 --> 02:25:57.121]  They sift through all the military and police and find the psychopaths, find the control freaks, find the criminals, just like Stalin did.
[02:25:57.942 --> 02:26:06.965]  And the people on those female helicopters and part of this shadow government system that's now more and more public, they are chosen because they hate America and hate freedom.
[02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:08.485]  They work for the bankers.
[02:26:08.825 --> 02:26:13.887]  They are literally the equivalent of the NKVD that Alexander Solzhenitsyn talked about.
[02:26:14.187 --> 02:26:15.628]  Bob Chapman, your take on that statement.
[02:26:15.648 --> 02:26:16.148]  Do you agree with that?
[02:26:17.236 --> 02:26:17.917]  Absolutely.
[02:26:18.997 --> 02:26:20.918]  They do select those kind of people.
[02:26:21.779 --> 02:26:22.940]  And most of them are criminals.
[02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:28.003]  They may not be convicted criminals, but they're criminal types, we'll call them.
[02:26:29.084 --> 02:26:35.748]  And the average military person and the average law enforcement person is not like that.
[02:26:36.548 --> 02:26:38.910]  I mean, you always find a few that get through.
[02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:41.872]  Maybe a small percentage.
[02:26:42.532 --> 02:26:46.395]  But these people are vicious animals.
[02:26:47.589 --> 02:26:54.273]  And you want to make sure once it starts that nobody makes it through it on the other side.
[02:26:54.733 --> 02:26:59.316]  Well, look, we hope nothing even comes to this, but we saw Waco, we've seen other issues.
[02:26:59.836 --> 02:27:05.439]  The point here at the end of the day is that people better choose a side.
[02:27:05.579 --> 02:27:08.381]  Folks, you know the government's been hijacked by foreign banks.
[02:27:08.981 --> 02:27:11.542]  Everything Bob and I and others have talked about has now come true.
[02:27:11.903 --> 02:27:13.563]  Are you ready for the rest of it to come true?
[02:27:14.044 --> 02:27:16.065]  There is no way out of this that's easy.
[02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:20.356]  You are not going to grovel and get along with this.
[02:27:20.376 --> 02:27:23.657]  You know this attitude, Bob, of yuppies and establishment types.
[02:27:23.697 --> 02:27:32.719]  They just think as long as they rationalize things and mentally decide to join this by just being passive that that gives them power over it.
[02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:36.820]  What would you say to people like that who haven't really studied history?
[02:27:38.361 --> 02:27:45.983]  Well, if you take a look at what the Germans did under the National Socialist Party, and if you look at what Stalin did,
[02:27:46.638 --> 02:27:51.741]  You'll find that all those who were complicit with them at the beginning were eliminated.
[02:27:53.342 --> 02:27:55.703]  And a good example were the brown shirts in Germany.
[02:27:56.584 --> 02:27:58.565]  They went in one night and killed most of them.
[02:27:59.845 --> 02:28:00.706]  But it's more than that.
[02:28:00.726 --> 02:28:03.247]  A lot of people aren't even going to join them.
[02:28:03.267 --> 02:28:07.770]  They're just going to make excuses for it and think magically that, well, I've done nothing.
[02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:08.630]  I licked boots.
[02:28:09.031 --> 02:28:10.431]  Why are you taking my farm?
[02:28:10.451 --> 02:28:11.612]  Why are you taking my house?
[02:28:11.952 --> 02:28:13.153]  Why are you taking my business?
[02:28:13.173 --> 02:28:14.194]  Why are you arresting me?
[02:28:15.314 --> 02:28:21.518]  In fact, I've noticed the globalists target bootlickers more than they even target those of us that fight them, Bob.
[02:28:21.718 --> 02:28:29.543]  I mean, I've been targeted, you've been targeted, a lot of stuff's gone on, but have you not noticed that the globalists almost enjoy eating their own?
[02:28:32.185 --> 02:28:33.546]  Yes, and just recently.
[02:28:33.846 --> 02:28:35.967]  They didn't get into that some years ago.
[02:28:36.648 --> 02:28:39.069]  But this is something that they have been doing.
[02:28:39.970 --> 02:28:43.212]  And I've talked to people in the military and
[02:28:44.706 --> 02:28:51.088]  Uh, it's very difficult for them to talk to one another because you don't know who's been planted in your unit.
[02:28:52.649 --> 02:28:53.509]  That's another thing.
[02:28:54.489 --> 02:29:12.235]  I mean, were the people who supposedly in SEAL Team 6, were they talking to other people in their unit or another unit that it really didn't happen or something like that?
[02:29:13.438 --> 02:29:19.096]  And did the government have one of their own SEALs in there spying on them?
[02:29:20.472 --> 02:29:21.352]  Well, of course they do.
[02:29:21.392 --> 02:29:24.134]  Those are some of the most heavily surveilled people out there.
[02:29:24.454 --> 02:29:27.155]  In fact, I've got some breaking SEAL Team 6 news.
[02:29:28.316 --> 02:29:35.460]  Briefly on the other side, and then Bob, I want to take a few farmer calls that are holding and then get into the big events of the week in the economy and what this signals.
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.582]  I mean, I know for us it's old news, but for the new listeners it's brand new.
[02:29:39.942 --> 02:29:43.023]  They're now admitting global financial meltdown, global depression.
[02:29:46.427 --> 02:29:47.788]  Now, where is it going from here?
[02:29:47.808 --> 02:29:50.349]  What do these new events signal on the timeline?
[02:29:50.369 --> 02:29:51.010]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:53.151]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:55.272]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.172 --> 02:29:58.853]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:07.495]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:30:07.895 --> 02:30:13.757]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:30:14.317 --> 02:30:16.057]  Number one, study the past.
[02:30:16.597 --> 02:30:18.358]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:30:18.998 --> 02:30:22.719]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:26.102]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:30:26.943 --> 02:30:30.206]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:30:30.767 --> 02:30:35.512]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:30:35.832 --> 02:30:39.236]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:30:39.816 --> 02:30:42.699]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:30:43.239 --> 02:30:47.203]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:47.723 --> 02:30:51.987]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:30:52.648 --> 02:30:56.772]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:30:57.292 --> 02:30:59.454]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:02.774 --> 02:31:06.397]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:06.778 --> 02:31:09.800]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:10.041 --> 02:31:14.805]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:14.825 --> 02:31:21.050]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:21.231 --> 02:31:23.473]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:23.993 --> 02:31:24.273]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:24.293 --> 02:31:24.734]  Bernanke?
[02:31:24.814 --> 02:31:25.274]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:25.294 --> 02:31:25.954]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:25.975 --> 02:31:27.616]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:42.907 --> 02:31:46.812]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:31:47.273 --> 02:31:49.836]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:50.176 --> 02:31:59.307]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:32:03.203 --> 02:32:06.824]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:07.164 --> 02:32:15.285]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:32:16.025 --> 02:32:20.066]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:32:20.646 --> 02:32:31.468]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:32:32.108 --> 02:32:41.110]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:41.610 --> 02:32:46.671]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:32:47.052 --> 02:32:54.213]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:54.533 --> 02:32:57.294]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:33:29.246 --> 02:33:32.429]  By the way, I haven't plugged really any sponsors or anything today.
[02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:35.371]  If you believe in what we're doing, please go to the online video bookstore.
[02:33:35.751 --> 02:33:37.813]  There's a lot of great Patriot apparel.
[02:33:38.253 --> 02:33:39.534]  Don't tread on me caps.
[02:33:39.995 --> 02:33:40.916]  In the Fed shirts.
[02:33:41.636 --> 02:33:42.957]  Infowars.com shirts.
[02:33:42.977 --> 02:33:45.920]  You want to meet like-minded people, you will meet them wearing.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:48.102]  Uh, the shirts and ball caps.
[02:33:48.462 --> 02:33:51.145]  Get the films, hand them out to people, get them on AXS TV.
[02:33:51.165 --> 02:33:52.946]  Infowars.com.
[02:33:53.547 --> 02:33:55.569]  Also, there's PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:58.592]  We are adding more and more to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:34:00.953 --> 02:34:07.978]  We've got these special reports we're doing multiple times a week now with Max Keiser and Gerald Salente, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, myself.
[02:34:07.998 --> 02:34:13.362]  Aaron just did another big live one last night that's now archived in the Daily Reports section.
[02:34:13.402 --> 02:34:15.203]  It just looks like it's another TV show.
[02:34:15.223 --> 02:34:18.105]  You know, we have this three-hour show every day and it's in that area.
[02:34:18.125 --> 02:34:19.806]  It's also in the Special Reports area.
[02:34:20.246 --> 02:34:23.649]  And we're about to have a whole new menu system that's going to be launched next week that makes it
[02:34:24.189 --> 02:34:30.615]  A little bit easier to find the special reports and then a whole special page for the nightly news reports that start September 1st.
[02:34:30.635 --> 02:34:32.257]  That'll be different from the special reports.
[02:34:32.497 --> 02:34:33.798]  We'll continue to have those as well.
[02:34:33.818 --> 02:34:36.641]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[02:34:36.661 --> 02:34:37.922]  We couldn't do this without you.
[02:34:38.763 --> 02:34:44.868]  I wanted to get to some more phone calls here with Bob Chapman.
[02:34:46.936 --> 02:34:48.957]  We've got Kristen, who never got on yesterday.
[02:34:48.977 --> 02:34:49.677]  I'm going to get to her today.
[02:34:49.737 --> 02:34:51.258]  We've got Wayne, an Arkansas farmer.
[02:34:51.619 --> 02:34:52.499]  John, who's a farmer.
[02:34:52.579 --> 02:34:53.500]  Freedom, who's a farmer.
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:54.760]  Daniel, who's a farmer.
[02:34:54.780 --> 02:35:01.765]  I want to try to move to you quickly and get a comment from Bob Chapman so we can then get into what's going on with the economy.
[02:35:02.645 --> 02:35:04.766]  Some with Bob, which is obviously why he's here.
[02:35:05.627 --> 02:35:08.028]  Let's go to John in PA.
[02:35:08.048 --> 02:35:08.669]  You're on the air.
[02:35:08.729 --> 02:35:09.029]  Welcome.
[02:35:10.529 --> 02:35:13.252]  Hey Alex, um, I just wanted to- I'm a farmer in Pebble Bay.
[02:35:13.272 --> 02:35:15.674]  I just wanted to say, uh, I know that you're a reptilian invader.
[02:35:15.714 --> 02:35:16.435]  Get off my planet.
[02:35:16.535 --> 02:35:18.296]  I know you- Bob Chapman, you're an alien.
[02:35:18.717 --> 02:35:19.658]  Turtillian invaders.
[02:35:20.458 --> 02:35:21.119]  Get off the planet.
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:22.360]  You're evil.
[02:35:24.062 --> 02:35:24.943]  Okay, thank you.
[02:35:24.983 --> 02:35:25.863]  They got us, Bob.
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.001]  Bob, they just got us.
[02:35:28.021 --> 02:35:29.162]  We're reptilian invaders.
[02:35:29.223 --> 02:35:39.514]  It's not about the government's coming in to start harassing the farmers and making them get commercial licenses and the drug testing and the inspections that come with it way outside their jurisdiction.
[02:35:40.154 --> 02:35:42.177]  We've been now exposed as reptilians, Bob.
[02:35:43.772 --> 02:35:54.057]  Well, I think they better check with the royal families in Europe because David Yank says they're reptilians and that means we're probably related to them and I don't like that very much.
[02:35:54.837 --> 02:35:55.838]  Chapman, you're something else.
[02:35:56.198 --> 02:36:08.244]  Seriously though, what about the federal power grab here of saying they're going to come on farms and ranches with the state under their auspices and start harassing all the farm equipment?
[02:36:10.436 --> 02:36:16.540]  I think it's... What do they expect to be able to prove other than try to intimidate?
[02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:17.480]  Well, no!
[02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:23.664]  I mean, you're going to go get a license and pay them money and waive your rights, and they're going to come out and harass you, the truck police, at your farm.
[02:36:25.264 --> 02:36:25.705]  I see.
[02:36:26.425 --> 02:36:32.488]  Well... Have your farm equipment in good working order.
[02:36:33.689 --> 02:36:34.870]  No, I'm not going to do it!
[02:36:35.430 --> 02:36:36.491]  I've got farm equipment.
[02:36:37.456 --> 02:36:38.276]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:36:38.637 --> 02:36:41.238]  I'm not going to go get a commercial driver's license.
[02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:45.220]  I'm not going to take drug tests whenever they say.
[02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:46.680]  That's what's in the news.
[02:36:48.261 --> 02:36:54.984]  Inspections of logs, maintenance logs, and then they come out on my property without a warrant because I've waived my rights.
[02:36:55.004 --> 02:36:56.705]  Do you realize the magnitude of this, Bob?
[02:36:58.505 --> 02:36:59.766]  It is very, very big.
[02:37:01.027 --> 02:37:03.968]  And it's part of that ID system that they want to put in.
[02:37:05.325 --> 02:37:08.106]  That's been held up on my driver's licenses.
[02:37:08.326 --> 02:37:11.867]  Well, they've got the animal ID, premises ID, it's all written by Big Agra.
[02:37:12.447 --> 02:37:13.908]  Let's talk to Freedom in Texas.
[02:37:13.948 --> 02:37:15.268]  Freedom, you're on the air, you're a farmer.
[02:37:16.269 --> 02:37:16.469]  Yeah.
[02:37:16.949 --> 02:37:30.333]  For one, Alex, the local water company was replaced by a huge multi-state sodium fluoride poison pushing thugopoly Southwest Water Company.
[02:37:31.694 --> 02:37:32.214]  Flagrantly.
[02:37:33.001 --> 02:37:37.290]  Heavily dose us all with toxic sludge, the sodium fluoride in our water.
[02:37:37.351 --> 02:37:38.493]  Killing my crops.
[02:37:38.633 --> 02:37:39.676]  Killing my pets.
[02:37:41.058 --> 02:37:41.880]  Killing all of us.
[02:37:42.875 --> 02:37:51.042]  Well, they're good globalists, and yeah, they come in under federal regulations, so you've got to upgrade your local water facility because it's not good enough for the people.
[02:37:51.642 --> 02:37:59.289]  Most of the multinationals are out of Europe, and they do come in and literally dump hundreds of toxic waste chemicals in your water, including uranium.
[02:37:59.729 --> 02:38:06.555]  And I've seen the farmers all over the country, there'll be a drought, they'll have to switch for their horses and cows to tap water, and they all die within a month.
[02:38:06.915 --> 02:38:09.017]  I mean, no wonder the public looks like mutated
[02:38:09.997 --> 02:38:12.279]  You know, grey-skinned creatures.
[02:38:12.599 --> 02:38:14.100]  We're being chemically murdered.
[02:38:14.441 --> 02:38:16.822]  There's a big report Aaron Dykes did last night.
[02:38:17.223 --> 02:38:18.564]  It's at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:38:18.604 --> 02:38:18.924]  Go ahead.
[02:38:18.944 --> 02:38:24.488]  I ask you to help stop truly evil Monsatino, i.e.
[02:38:25.508 --> 02:38:26.629]  Monsanto.
[02:38:26.689 --> 02:38:28.471]  We all gotta buy organic people.
[02:38:28.491 --> 02:38:30.052]  We gotta shop farmer's markets.
[02:38:30.092 --> 02:38:30.432]  We gotta...
[02:38:31.597 --> 02:38:32.498]  Whenever possible.
[02:38:33.738 --> 02:38:34.639]  Freedom, you're awesome.
[02:38:34.699 --> 02:38:35.760]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:37.501]  Let's talk to Daniel in Iowa.
[02:38:38.561 --> 02:38:41.843]  Farmer's wife, or Daniela, excuse me, you're on the air.
[02:38:41.863 --> 02:38:43.084]  That's okay.
[02:38:43.124 --> 02:38:43.724]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:38:44.945 --> 02:38:57.553]  You know, I think that this just goes to show that things are financially bad and this is a way that the government can come in and make money and use fear and intimidation tactics.
[02:38:58.193 --> 02:38:59.335]  We're good to go.
[02:39:19.515 --> 02:39:24.760]  And then it came down the road, and it didn't sit at my house, but then it sat up at his grandma's house for a while.
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:27.382]  And about a half an hour later, I got ready to leave.
[02:39:27.442 --> 02:39:31.986]  I'm driving down the gravel road, come to a stop sign, and the car's still sitting there.
[02:39:32.646 --> 02:39:40.773]  And so I stop, and I roll my window down, and it's this really sweet 70-year-old woman sitting in the car, and I said, ma'am, is everything okay?
[02:39:41.254 --> 02:39:45.878]  And she goes, yeah, I'm just driving around, making notes, taking down people's addresses.
[02:39:46.997 --> 02:39:49.418]  And I thought that was really, really odd.
[02:39:51.259 --> 02:40:09.085]  Well, they've been coming up and GPS-ing especially rural areas for decades, but now the census is to be year-round and even monthly, and they're GPS-ing your door, they're talking to your neighbors about you, and it's just, they're using the name of the census to put HUMINT on the ground.
[02:40:09.425 --> 02:40:11.706]  We already knew about this three years ago, but now it's been announced.
[02:40:12.366 --> 02:40:13.107]  All of the major
[02:40:15.185 --> 02:40:22.652]  Postal service trucks are going to have wireless scoops on them, stealing all the data, and also anti-terror sensors on them.
[02:40:23.313 --> 02:40:26.276]  The police cars are getting face scanners on them, license plate readers.
[02:40:26.716 --> 02:40:28.858]  I mean, look, the Defense Department's foreign-owned.
[02:40:29.338 --> 02:40:30.179]  It's big business.
[02:40:30.239 --> 02:40:31.480]  They've conquered the whole world.
[02:40:31.761 --> 02:40:39.108]  We financed the takeover, and now they're going to come here and turn this whole country into a giant Fallujah Abu Ghraib control system.
[02:40:39.929 --> 02:40:41.070]  And I'm not just saying that.
[02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:46.872]  You've heard the troops call in and go, yeah, we set up TSA checkpoints three, four years ago, groping the women, body scanning.
[02:40:47.632 --> 02:40:52.314]  MIT admits that the system they've set up in Iraq was designed for here.
[02:40:52.715 --> 02:40:54.015]  A giant prison.
[02:40:54.695 --> 02:40:56.796]  And you're going to get inspections as a prisoner.
[02:40:57.317 --> 02:41:00.738]  You're not going to have a garden without a proper authorization and inspection.
[02:41:00.818 --> 02:41:02.279]  You might grow marijuana.
[02:41:03.119 --> 02:41:06.521]  And if you grow marijuana, that's going to cut in on the price of the marijuana they ship in.
[02:41:07.341 --> 02:41:09.202]  This is corporate takeover.
[02:41:10.151 --> 02:41:11.492]  I mean, they've taken over every industry.
[02:41:11.512 --> 02:41:14.916]  They've taken over talk radio in almost every area.
[02:41:15.376 --> 02:41:17.078]  They've taken over the farming, the ranching.
[02:41:17.718 --> 02:41:18.779]  They're taking everything over.
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:20.561]  They're taking the family over.
[02:41:21.522 --> 02:41:25.045]  They're coming out and lobbying government to make you take more vaccines.
[02:41:25.746 --> 02:41:29.269]  You know, to have Rick Perry come out and say it's the law, your kids have got to take shots.
[02:41:29.890 --> 02:41:30.851]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:30.911 --> 02:41:34.234]  Any comments on what Danielle was saying there, Bob Chapman?
[02:41:36.485 --> 02:41:45.053]  No, but we've seen instances of that, as you pointed out, with the census, and the excuses for these people to be there.
[02:41:46.254 --> 02:41:50.017]  And, you know, if you see people around, you know they're up to something.
[02:41:50.397 --> 02:41:54.281]  Because people shouldn't be in those areas, especially sitting in a vehicle.
[02:41:55.069 --> 02:41:55.969]  You know, for some period of time.
[02:41:55.989 --> 02:41:57.690]  Well, I would have said, who are you here for?
[02:41:57.730 --> 02:41:59.550]  And I guarantee you, it would have been the Census.
[02:41:59.670 --> 02:42:03.631]  You see, if they, quote, can't get all the data they want, they go to your neighbors.
[02:42:03.691 --> 02:42:06.212]  And again, it's all part of hiding in plain view.
[02:42:07.572 --> 02:42:09.992]  What's the name they use in Scarface?
[02:42:10.332 --> 02:42:16.034]  You want a Chavano on every corner, watching you, telling you what to eat, when to sleep, what to wear?
[02:42:17.534 --> 02:42:18.314]  You want to be a sheep?
[02:42:20.915 --> 02:42:22.135]  I mean, that's what we're talking about here.
[02:42:22.636 --> 02:42:28.077]  I want to go back to more calls from farmers in Hawaii, Texas, and Kristen, who never got on yesterday in a moment.
[02:42:29.697 --> 02:42:36.619]  But Bob, just briefly, I mean, obviously you predicted, unfortunately, everything that's happened, but just a brief synopsis.
[02:42:37.039 --> 02:42:43.221]  What happened this week with the global meltdown accelerating, with gold exploding, and where is it going in the future?
[02:42:46.972 --> 02:42:59.040]  In America, the state of the changes was the intercession by S&P downgrading the United States government's rating on paper, their bonds.
[02:43:00.181 --> 02:43:14.470]  And this was done, and the other two rating agencies didn't do that, this was done in order to, as far as I can see, chop up the benefits of Social Security
[02:43:15.545 --> 02:43:18.488]  As well as the Medicare.
[02:43:18.868 --> 02:43:35.944]  And of course the other part of what they did had nothing to do with that directly, but they wanted to impose this, what I call the Obama Enabling Act, which is bypassing Congress.
[02:43:36.684 --> 02:43:40.588]  But those things, when they happened,
[02:43:41.437 --> 02:44:09.680]  uh... caused the market to become unsound at least on a short term basis and they were going up and down five or six hundred points a day uh... the market is in a weakened condition because investors, professionals they buy earnings down the road six months to a year from now uh... generally speaking most of them are long-term investors and the uh... the uh...
[02:44:10.706 --> 02:44:19.492]  Earnings for S&P companies are going to go down this coming year and during the last half of this year as well.
[02:44:20.333 --> 02:44:28.059]  And instead of making $13, $130 a share, they'll probably make $60 or $70.
[02:44:28.299 --> 02:44:29.820]  And that's a big difference.
[02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:34.783]  So fundamentally, the market should come down and this thing disrupted.
[02:44:34.823 --> 02:44:39.627]  At the same time, of course, the President's Group in Financial Markets
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:54.650]  They went in and they first attacked silver and then they attacked gold and they increased the margin requirements on gold and that's not so bad because that has a short-term effect.
[02:44:54.690 --> 02:45:00.074]  Most of the people who are in the forex markets today and in the comics
[02:45:01.488 --> 02:45:03.890]  The LBMA in London are pretty big hitters.
[02:45:04.731 --> 02:45:06.052]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[02:45:06.112 --> 02:45:09.936]  They did this four months ago, increased margins, and it knocked it down for a while.
[02:45:10.296 --> 02:45:12.178]  This time, it didn't even really knock it down.
[02:45:12.218 --> 02:45:13.439]  It just stopped the run.
[02:45:13.459 --> 02:45:22.828]  And it really shows they're running out of bullets and getting desperate as the world realizes they're going to devalue the dollar down to basically nothing.
[02:45:24.069 --> 02:45:25.431]  And the fact that
[02:45:26.941 --> 02:45:32.706]  I saw last night the cover of Time is going to be the end of Europe, the collapse of Europe.
[02:45:33.666 --> 02:45:39.271]  So it's clear that there's a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[02:45:39.291 --> 02:45:46.496]  And now the SEC is going to investigate Stern and Poors and find out if George Soros did get that tip.
[02:45:47.017 --> 02:45:48.998]  So this is getting crazier and crazier, Bob.
[02:45:49.038 --> 02:45:53.582]  But clearly, this signifies the fact that they're pretty much admitting we're in a depression.
[02:45:55.151 --> 02:46:01.114]  You're right about that, and it's an inflationary depression, and it has been for the last two and a half years.
[02:46:02.314 --> 02:46:06.496]  And that will continue because they've got to do a QE3 type of thing.
[02:46:06.916 --> 02:46:11.939]  I'm looking for $2.5 billion that they'll create in order to keep the system going sideways.
[02:46:13.059 --> 02:46:21.623]  And if they don't do that, you know, it's a minus 5% of GDP, and that'll feed on itself, and then deflation will take over, and they don't want that.
[02:46:22.410 --> 02:46:26.413]  And they're not near that now, because they're smothering it, and have for 11 years.
[02:46:26.614 --> 02:46:28.295]  Okay, real briefly, where's gold going?
[02:46:28.675 --> 02:46:29.776]  Where's gold going?
[02:46:29.896 --> 02:46:34.900]  It's going to bottom out in here, probably early next week, and that'll be the end of the correction.
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:38.123]  And it's good, because it went up pretty fast.
[02:46:38.984 --> 02:46:43.668]  It's come back, it'll settle in, and it'll move towards $2,000.
[02:46:44.268 --> 02:46:45.749]  And it could hit it in September.
[02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:48.171]  And maybe even sooner, for all we know.
[02:46:48.191 --> 02:46:50.814]  What do you make of JP Morgan saying $2,500 by the end of the year?
[02:46:52.156 --> 02:46:54.977]  Yeah, well, let me tell you my take on that.
[02:46:54.997 --> 02:46:58.757]  I've been doing this a long time, and I know how their minds work.
[02:47:00.378 --> 02:47:03.919]  JPM didn't want to come out with that, but they had to, and I'll tell you why.
[02:47:04.839 --> 02:47:07.259]  Because they know gold is going higher soon.
[02:47:08.079 --> 02:47:09.340]  They said by the end of the year.
[02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:15.021]  I say by the end of February, because that's usually the end of the big season and gold on the plus side.
[02:47:15.941 --> 02:47:19.942]  And what they're doing here is setting up a blocker.
[02:47:20.799 --> 02:47:24.781]  They want everybody to think gold's going to $2,500, but it isn't going any higher.
[02:47:25.702 --> 02:47:27.162]  Because they know it's going higher.
[02:47:28.023 --> 02:47:30.964]  So they want to stop it, cut it off at the pass, so to speak.
[02:47:31.345 --> 02:47:32.885]  So that's their thinking in that.
[02:47:34.026 --> 02:47:37.968]  It's good for us, because they've admitted they know where gold's going.
[02:47:39.209 --> 02:47:46.913]  Now, we're going to tell them, we know what you're doing, and it's going to $3,000, $3,200 by the end of the year or by the end of February.
[02:47:47.733 --> 02:47:49.374]  And silver will go right with it.
[02:47:50.091 --> 02:47:51.572]  And they're buried in silver.
[02:47:52.112 --> 02:47:52.992]  And they can't get out.
[02:47:54.173 --> 02:47:57.614]  And by that, they've made a lot of naked shorts and things to try to keep it down.
[02:47:57.674 --> 02:48:03.576]  And this really is a debacle and it exposes their fiat currency and its global devaluation.
[02:48:03.596 --> 02:48:06.057]  Let's go to Christine in Arizona.
[02:48:06.417 --> 02:48:07.658]  Christine, thank you for holding.
[02:48:07.678 --> 02:48:08.958]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:48:10.359 --> 02:48:10.699]  Hi.
[02:48:11.599 --> 02:48:15.781]  I have a deeply disturbing question.
[02:48:16.952 --> 02:48:28.505]  I don't know if you've seen it, I don't know why it hasn't been posted, but Obama is going to the Congress to ask them to suspend a banking law to allow them to lease
[02:48:29.881 --> 02:48:31.062]  Directly to
[02:48:47.859 --> 02:48:49.681]  But now you live for the government.
[02:48:49.741 --> 02:48:58.988]  It's basically millions more Americans going on a weird form of government housing and federal courts have ruled you don't have any Fourth Amendment rights when you live in government housing.
[02:48:59.028 --> 02:49:00.610]  Yes, that is big news.
[02:49:01.673 --> 02:49:05.355]  Well, the problem is, is if you were a banker, which would you rather do?
[02:49:05.835 --> 02:49:10.558]  Would you rather lease to somebody, or would you rather loan and take a chance on the loan going down?
[02:49:10.898 --> 02:49:15.000]  I mean, if this goes through, it'll never come back.
[02:49:15.841 --> 02:49:20.243]  We're now where we were in the days of serfs and lords.
[02:49:21.664 --> 02:49:24.005]  That's always been the plan.
[02:49:24.045 --> 02:49:27.346]  Look, people keep asking, is Obama trying to destroy the free market?
[02:49:27.786 --> 02:49:29.007]  And the answer is no.
[02:49:29.287 --> 02:49:31.348]  He's a teleprompter reading frontman.
[02:49:31.588 --> 02:49:37.611]  The mega banks that all these conservatives worship all day, the big corporations are anti-free market.
[02:49:38.111 --> 02:49:42.373]  They're buying the Republicans as well to shut down our economies.
[02:49:42.413 --> 02:49:44.114]  They're criminal scum.
[02:49:44.394 --> 02:49:45.594]  And people better get upset.
[02:49:45.634 --> 02:49:46.855]  In fact, there's the New York Times.
[02:49:47.315 --> 02:49:48.496]  And yes, they're moving now
[02:49:51.486 --> 02:49:52.007]  That's L.A.
[02:49:52.027 --> 02:49:56.470]  Times, also saw it in the New York Times, but I'm sorry, ma'am, go ahead.
[02:49:57.050 --> 02:50:04.616]  You know, he retooled his article to say, we want to do this because there's so many foreclosed properties out there, we want to get them rented.
[02:50:05.016 --> 02:50:09.960]  But the bottom line is, once they change that law, it'll never get changed back.
[02:50:12.722 --> 02:50:23.431]  Ma'am, ma'am, they've given tens of trillions to foreign banks, and the news did reports a few years ago saying if you'd have given that money to the people with houses that were upside down, it would have paid for all the houses 100% more.
[02:50:23.952 --> 02:50:28.075]  Again, in the name of, they claim that, oh, this is happening to the economy because of mortgages.
[02:50:28.356 --> 02:50:29.697]  It had nothing to do with it.
[02:50:29.937 --> 02:50:31.679]  It was the overall derivatives.
[02:50:32.299 --> 02:50:34.641]  And Bob Chapman comments on that.
[02:50:36.623 --> 02:50:38.745]  Yes, and eight years ago,
[02:50:39.842 --> 02:50:42.424]  Uh, I said that, uh, Panning and Freddie were broke.
[02:50:42.944 --> 02:50:44.285]  Everybody in the Beltway knew it.
[02:50:44.785 --> 02:50:52.490]  They would go under, and the end of what they're trying to do, and now this is eight years ago, is to nationalize housing.
[02:50:53.050 --> 02:50:56.292]  And this is exactly what that speech was about.
[02:50:56.312 --> 02:51:01.175]  They've already taken over GM and then gave them five billion to move to China and Brazil.
[02:51:01.235 --> 02:51:02.476]  I mean, it's pure treason.
[02:51:04.217 --> 02:51:08.159]  From the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas.
[02:51:20.481 --> 02:51:24.927]  Life Before the Collapse Vinyl LP by The Lost Vegas

[02:52:02.972 --> 02:52:07.257]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:52:07.677 --> 02:52:13.523]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:52:14.104 --> 02:52:15.846]  Number one, study the past.
[02:52:16.367 --> 02:52:18.128]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:52:18.769 --> 02:52:22.493]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:52:23.621 --> 02:52:25.883]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:52:26.704 --> 02:52:29.967]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:52:30.548 --> 02:52:35.273]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:52:35.613 --> 02:52:39.017]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:52:39.597 --> 02:52:42.459]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:52:42.999 --> 02:52:46.962]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:47.502 --> 02:52:51.745]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[02:53:02.532 --> 02:53:06.837]  Fight back this cold and flu season with the world's best garlic extract, Ali-C.
[02:53:06.998 --> 02:53:07.799]  Why Ali-C?
[02:53:07.859 --> 02:53:11.223]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[02:53:11.423 --> 02:53:19.112]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:53:19.472 --> 02:53:24.878]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[02:53:25.059 --> 02:53:29.724]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[02:53:30.285 --> 02:53:33.648]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[02:53:33.969 --> 02:53:40.116]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:53:40.416 --> 02:53:45.039]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.

[02:54:02.927 --> 02:54:08.053]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:08.754 --> 02:54:11.017]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:12.218 --> 02:54:20.347]  You know, I want to get to Tenton, Hawaii, Matthew in Texas, Sophia.
[02:54:22.863 --> 02:54:23.744]  All these are farmers.
[02:54:23.764 --> 02:54:26.486]  We'll have to do some overdrive, but the main show's over in five minutes.
[02:54:26.526 --> 02:54:31.389]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up with Bob Chapman to give folks a gold and silver offer.
[02:54:31.409 --> 02:54:33.390]  You know, gold has gone up above $1,800.
[02:54:33.450 --> 02:54:39.774]  But the high in trading a few nights ago was $1,808 or something.
[02:54:39.794 --> 02:54:43.737]  It dropped down to, you know, the $730s, $740s, went all over the map.
[02:54:44.257 --> 02:54:47.039]  But you're talking about up hundreds of dollars in the last few weeks.
[02:54:47.959 --> 02:54:49.921]  And people say, is this the bubble?
[02:54:51.168 --> 02:54:51.769]  No, no, no.
[02:54:51.889 --> 02:54:56.311]  The bubble, you're looking at the wrong bubble, is in global currencies being devalued.
[02:54:57.011 --> 02:54:58.853]  And so that's inflationary bubble.
[02:54:59.493 --> 02:55:09.679]  So yes, it is a bubble, but it's not that gold is in some bubble, like a Beanie Baby fad, or a Cabbage Patch Doll fad, or, you know, the fad goes for three months and then it's over.
[02:55:10.579 --> 02:55:14.201]  This isn't like, you know, some type of, it's not a fad.
[02:55:14.661 --> 02:55:18.624]  Just like it's not a fad that the last five years your gas prices keep going up.
[02:55:19.486 --> 02:55:21.089]  It's because of dollar devaluation.
[02:55:21.369 --> 02:55:23.072]  Is that a good way of putting it, Ted Anderson?
[02:55:25.736 --> 02:55:32.566]  It's been a fad, it's been a fad since the Egyptians were on this earth, because when they opened up the tombs they found gold, not fiat paper money.
[02:55:33.049 --> 02:55:35.170]  You mean they didn't find some paper money in there?
[02:55:35.571 --> 02:55:37.152]  No, they didn't find any at all.
[02:55:37.172 --> 02:55:38.332]  They found silver and gold.
[02:55:38.393 --> 02:55:42.055]  As a matter of fact, Jesus was given up for silver coins, not paper money.
[02:55:42.095 --> 02:55:46.298]  If you study history, paper money systems die.
[02:55:46.318 --> 02:55:55.424]  Yeah, these paper systems have been around a few thousand years and they always wreck societies and we're like, gee, folks are going to move to gold and silver as there's a global devaluation.
[02:55:56.464 --> 02:56:00.706]  There's a deal you guys have got where you get a franc already at a super good price.
[02:56:00.766 --> 02:56:01.986]  It's right at a fifth ounce gold.
[02:56:02.586 --> 02:56:03.247]  European franc.
[02:56:03.287 --> 02:56:04.727]  Beautiful little historical coins.
[02:56:05.027 --> 02:56:05.568]  Great deal.
[02:56:05.868 --> 02:56:10.089]  You get a free year subscription on the International Forecaster either digital or hard copy.
[02:56:10.329 --> 02:56:12.010]  That's $159 value.
[02:56:12.090 --> 02:56:14.731]  Absolutely free when you call Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:56:18.192 --> 02:56:24.077]  You've also got the deal where you can get, and this by the way has been selling out every week, I'm having to get Ted more and more of these, he just got them in.
[02:56:24.577 --> 02:56:33.584]  The Big Brother, excellent book, the documentary film on the banking system, The American Dream, that free and free shipping with two silver dollars for $88.
[02:56:35.325 --> 02:56:39.769]  It's a great deal to get two silver dollars for $88, much less free shipping, free book, free film.
[02:56:40.149 --> 02:56:43.032]  That deal, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[02:56:43.232 --> 02:56:52.040]  But you've also, when you call, a whole list of radio specials, and there'll be brokers there throughout the weekend.
[02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:52.920]  Big specials.
[02:56:53.621 --> 02:56:58.085]  But Ted, if this continues, you have been going up in price, even on the radio specials.
[02:56:58.205 --> 02:57:00.187]  Are you going to go up next week if this continues, Ted?
[02:57:00.547 --> 02:57:01.268]  Well, of course.
[02:57:01.328 --> 02:57:05.913]  I mean, I can't keep my prices low because my wholesale costs are just going through the roof right now.
[02:57:06.093 --> 02:57:08.676]  I mean, you've got a compounding problem.
[02:57:08.696 --> 02:57:12.801]  You've got a shortage of both silver and gold now that are occurring in the marketplace.
[02:57:13.321 --> 02:57:15.744]  And then you have the prices rising like they have been.
[02:57:15.764 --> 02:57:18.087]  I mean, the CME thing has given me a little bit of a
[02:57:18.687 --> 02:57:19.127]  Absolutely!
[02:57:40.322 --> 02:57:42.143]  Well, folks, call about the radio specials.
[02:57:42.163 --> 02:57:43.103]  They are great deals.
[02:57:43.123 --> 02:57:43.683]  800-686-2237.
[02:57:46.124 --> 02:57:53.607]  Bob, what do you say to folks that said it was a bubble at $300 and $1,000 and $1,500, and they're saying, we actually get laughed at for being right.
[02:57:53.627 --> 02:57:55.688]  It's like some weird mental illness or something.
[02:57:55.948 --> 02:57:58.089]  They go, you people are crazy buying gold and silver.
[02:57:58.369 --> 02:57:59.990]  We're like, yeah, we're crazy like a fox.
[02:58:00.310 --> 02:58:02.010]  What do you say to folks that talk about bubbles?
[02:58:02.931 --> 02:58:05.892]  Well, I've been putting up with that for over 50 years.
[02:58:06.652 --> 02:58:08.713]  And so I have an armadillo skin.
[02:58:09.821 --> 02:58:12.402]  And when it comes to all of those complaints and so on.
[02:58:13.062 --> 02:58:21.364]  But what I tell them is, basically what Ted had to say, you know, this has been going on for five or six thousand years.
[02:58:21.744 --> 02:58:26.185]  The only real money in the world is gold and silver's been used as money as well.
[02:58:26.885 --> 02:58:28.486]  And it's the only thing that really works.
[02:58:29.526 --> 02:58:29.626]  And
[02:58:30.911 --> 02:58:32.912]  Are you paying higher prices for what you're buying?
[02:58:32.952 --> 02:58:33.573]  Yes, I am.
[02:58:33.933 --> 02:58:37.515]  Well, that means we have inflation, and we have inflation... Absolutely.
[02:58:37.535 --> 02:58:38.356]  We're out of time.
[02:58:38.396 --> 02:58:39.997]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:40.037 --> 02:58:40.457]  Central.
[02:58:40.637 --> 02:58:42.298]  I'm gonna pop back with the calls from farmers.
[02:58:44.479 --> 02:58:46.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.901 --> 02:58:50.123]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.071 --> 02:58:53.212]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:58:53.232 --> 02:58:59.914]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:59:00.175 --> 02:59:02.476]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:02.736 --> 02:59:07.898]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:08.098 --> 02:59:10.899]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:11.139 --> 02:59:13.260]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:19.402]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:19.722 --> 02:59:22.903]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:23.083 --> 02:59:28.605]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:59:28.885 --> 02:59:30.185]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:30.505 --> 02:59:31.686]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:59:31.806 --> 02:59:34.366]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:34.486 --> 02:59:35.907]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:59:36.167 --> 02:59:38.529]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:38.709 --> 02:59:43.192]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:43.332 --> 02:59:45.774]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:59:49.777 --> 02:59:51.518]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:59:52.879 --> 02:59:55.821]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.462 --> 02:59:59.664]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.152 --> 03:00:11.838]  Okay, I'm doing five minutes of overdrive here because I really want to get to these farmers that have been patiently holding.
[03:00:11.898 --> 03:00:15.101]  Ted, then Matthew and Sophia, that's all we'll have time for.
[03:00:15.161 --> 03:00:17.083]  Wayne, the Arkansas farmer, just hung up.
[03:00:17.664 --> 03:00:18.544]  He was next.
[03:00:18.985 --> 03:00:20.626]  Ted, in Hawaii, you're on the air.
[03:00:21.127 --> 03:00:27.533]  So, the feds say they're going to run your farm and control the jurisdiction for you to be able to run any motorized equipment.
[03:00:27.573 --> 03:00:28.134]  How's that sound?
[03:00:28.154 --> 03:00:29.015]  Sound like freedom to you?
[03:00:34.019 --> 03:00:35.800]  Yeah, Ted, your phone's breaking up there, buddy.
[03:00:35.820 --> 03:00:38.521]  Okay, there goes Ted in Hawaii.
[03:00:39.182 --> 03:00:40.982]  I went along trying to get to you guys.
[03:00:41.363 --> 03:00:42.903]  Matthew in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:00:42.923 --> 03:00:53.168]  I don't know what's going on with the phone system, but we'll see if he comes back.
[03:00:53.248 --> 03:00:55.830]  Sophia in California, let's see if you're able to speak.
[03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:56.250]  Go ahead.
[03:01:00.424 --> 03:01:03.965]  Yeah, I think the phone system's gotta be having trouble to go to three callers and it not work.
[03:01:04.385 --> 03:01:07.626]  That's funny, the Genesis phone system does some weird things sometimes.
[03:01:08.046 --> 03:01:09.826]  Not very often, but when it rains, it pours.
[03:01:10.366 --> 03:01:15.847]  And I went into overdrive to, uh, so I could get to those farmers there, because I've really been trying to take more calls.
[03:01:16.307 --> 03:01:23.749]  It's kind of a love-hate relationship, because, uh, because, uh, you know, I enjoy calls, but I also want to get to all the news.
[03:01:24.649 --> 03:01:25.849]  And boy, is there a lot of it.
[03:01:26.269 --> 03:01:28.810]  There is so much incredible news and information out there.
[03:01:30.492 --> 03:01:52.605]  By the way, Aaron Dykes has done a big special report last night, and he put three days of work into it, along with the crew, dealing with eugenics, and the headline, when it gets posted on InfoWars.com, is going to be... Let me check and see if it's up there yet, because I forget the headline.
[03:01:53.145 --> 03:01:56.087]  InfoWars special report, globalist extermination list,
[03:01:57.009 --> 03:01:57.529]  Exposed.
[03:01:57.570 --> 03:02:05.455]  And it gets into how they've always numbered and tracked people and taken blood from babies at birth to track folks through life and how they're killing people slowly.
[03:02:05.475 --> 03:02:06.276]  They like to.
[03:02:06.336 --> 03:02:07.317]  They enjoy their work.
[03:02:08.547 --> 03:02:13.789]  And that big special report is now up on Infowars.com.
[03:02:14.529 --> 03:02:21.472]  And I hope that we get it out to everybody because it is highly produced.
[03:02:21.532 --> 03:02:22.833]  A lot of work went into it.
[03:02:23.353 --> 03:02:30.856]  And again, the special reports that'll be time to time as news warrants could be 10 minutes, they could be 30, they could be an hour, they could be two hours.
[03:02:31.136 --> 03:02:32.076]  They've been all those links.
[03:02:32.156 --> 03:02:33.977]  I did one 50 minutes this week.
[03:02:35.231 --> 03:02:39.057]  Uh, did a couple last week that were an hour long, did one that was two hours long the week before that.
[03:02:39.698 --> 03:02:41.360]  You're gonna be seeing these in the new studio.
[03:02:42.963 --> 03:02:44.365]  And we do it without teleprompters.
[03:02:44.926 --> 03:02:50.374]  We do our research, got our facts, get our graphics and documents together, our exhibits, and we put it on.
[03:02:51.784 --> 03:02:54.925]  And the information is unrivaled with anything you're going to find out there.
[03:02:55.005 --> 03:03:06.669]  So if you believe in what we're doing and you'd like to see us even expand the quality more and continue to be able to hire more people at home what we're doing, your support of PrisonPlanet.tv makes it all possible.
[03:03:07.583 --> 03:03:09.304]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:03:10.204 --> 03:03:13.746]  And right now, the special reports are going into the daily reports.
[03:03:13.766 --> 03:03:15.286]  You know, the live radio show.
[03:03:15.626 --> 03:03:16.267]  It's archived.
[03:03:16.327 --> 03:03:17.587]  It's also a video program.
[03:03:18.728 --> 03:03:19.928]  We call it Alex Jones Live.
[03:03:20.348 --> 03:03:24.090]  These special reports just go into there, and so you'll see the name of it.
[03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:25.531]  You'll see that there's two shows there.
[03:03:26.171 --> 03:03:29.932]  We also have a system where we then move it into an area called Special Reports.
[03:03:30.573 --> 03:03:35.595]  And if you have the power of Sherlock Holmes, plus a little, you can find them.
[03:03:36.335 --> 03:03:36.775]  Joking.
[03:03:37.376 --> 03:03:39.557]  But we are revamping PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:03:39.597 --> 03:03:56.468]  In fact, we've got a special page already built that makes it much more easy and accessible for the special reports, the nightly news reports, because the site was set up for the movies, expanded extras, and the daily TV show.
[03:03:57.475 --> 03:03:59.437]  And it's all there on the site.
[03:04:00.377 --> 03:04:04.360]  But we've reworked the site and that'll be launched next week.
[03:04:04.861 --> 03:04:10.084]  And then we're going to create a whole new site in the future that is off an entirely new platform.
[03:04:10.125 --> 03:04:19.251]  But again, it is your $5.95 a month, your $0.15 a day, that funds PrisonPlanet.tv and so much of what we're doing here.
[03:04:19.311 --> 03:04:22.474]  So I want to thank all of you that are members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:22.494 --> 03:04:26.257]  And I want to ask those of you that are listening on AM and FM stations, internet,
[03:04:27.057 --> 03:04:27.598]  Other ways.
[03:04:27.878 --> 03:04:38.806]  Become a PrisonPlanet.tv member to support alternative media and this important message and to be able to go in and download and burn to disk topics on every subject you can imagine dealing with freedom in the fight against tyranny.
[03:04:39.286 --> 03:04:41.448]  Like I said, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:41.488 --> 03:04:43.549]  Central and back next Monday, 11 a.m.
[03:04:43.569 --> 03:04:44.030]  to 2 p.m.
[03:04:44.410 --> 03:04:44.750]  Central.
[03:04:44.990 --> 03:04:45.811]  Be careful out there.
[03:04:45.871 --> 03:04:46.471]  Drive safe.
[03:04:47.092 --> 03:04:47.812]  Spread the word.
[03:04:47.932 --> 03:04:49.333]  Educate as many people as you can.
[03:04:50.555 --> 03:04:54.041]  The people are awake and angry at government, and they're ready to hear the full truth.
[03:04:54.542 --> 03:04:57.427]  So it's up to all of us to get the word out right now.
[03:04:57.608 --> 03:04:58.930]  All of you are the solution.
[03:04:59.371 --> 03:05:00.152]  Look in the mirror.
[03:05:00.212 --> 03:05:01.074]  You are the solution.
[03:05:01.114 --> 03:05:01.675]  Great job, crew.
