[00:00:01.383 --> 00:00:05.566]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:07.028]  You want answers?
[00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:08.709]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.953]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.621]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:25.542]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.183]  It is the 30th day of November 2011.
[00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:31.366]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:39.291]  Lyndon LaRouche, geopolitical analyst and historian, former presidential candidate, will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:43.814]  Syndicated radio host Eric Mancow-Muller will also be joining us.
[00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:48.217]  And, of course, General Hamid Gul is going to be joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:50.058]  They did pass
[00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:53.460]  The bill in the Senate to secretly arrest U.S.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.502]  citizens and never be seen again.
[00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.984]  And to use the military on the streets of America.
[00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.286]  They've overthrown Posse Comitatus with this.
[00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:04.169]  If the President signs it, he says he's going to veto it.
[00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.970]  You know why he's going to veto it?
[00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.132]  He says he has the power outside of Congress.
[00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:11.234]  He can already arrest citizens and send them to Guantanamo Bay.
[00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.257]  So, I don't think his veto means anything.
[00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:18.280]  This is basically the executive and the legislative fighting with each other.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.562]  Now they're trying to pass a bill for total torture.
[00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:25.255]  So the entire Republic is being overthrown right now.
[00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:28.557]  Federal Reserve is going to bail out its European bank owners.
[00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:29.537]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:32.218]  Incredible things are unfolding.
[00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:43.223]  But our audience listening on XM, AMFM, Shortwave Satellite, Infowars.com is really lucky and blessed to be able to hear from General Hamid Gul.
[00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:59.094]  He is a retired general who served as Director General of the Inner Service Intelligence, ISI, Pakistani Intelligence, the premier intelligence agency in that country between 87-89, winning the war against the Russians during the late stages of the Soviet-Afghan War.
[00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:06.340]  He was involved in the whole thing, of course, and was involved in the war with India as a frontline tank commander before that in his younger years.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.906]  And he joins us now, goals tenure as the head of the ISI, considered with Benazir Bhutto's term as the Prime Minister of Pakistan.
[00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:18.050]  And he joins us now to break down the incredible developments.
[00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.897]  We'll talk more about it in the next segment with the Russians saying they're going to block the roads in from the other side into Afghanistan.
[00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:28.120]  Pakistan blocking the main supply route into Afghanistan.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.862]  Russian warships going up.
[00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:37.089]  by Syria, because Russia recognizes the banks that run this country are desperate.
[00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.074]  They want to start a global war to cover up all their criminal activity.
[00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:43.617]  General Gould, we've only got a few minutes.
[00:02:43.637 --> 00:02:46.019]  We're going to come back from break, but it's good to have you with us.
[00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.843]  In a two-minute summation, are we creeping closer to World War III?
[00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:53.382]  Alex Jones, I hope not.
[00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:54.042]  I hope not.
[00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:56.363]  I don't think we are going to go over the brink.
[00:02:57.123 --> 00:03:01.765]  Pakistan would also, I'm sure, exercise sobriety in the end.
[00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:09.067]  But it is only a paradigm shift which is needed on part of America which is going to pull us out of this quagmire.
[00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:18.311]  So we have to wait and see how American policymakers, because they never stop surprising me, they shoot themselves in the foot every now and then.
[00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.534]  And this is an almost critical period.
[00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.037]  They have to pull out from Afghanistan.
[00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:25.199]  They've lost the war.
[00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.922]  And I don't know why they are doing all this.
[00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:31.546]  So, really, we have to show that.
[00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:38.335]  Because there is a possibility, as you very rightly said, that we could go to war because of Israel and India.
[00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:40.097]  Not because of America.
[00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:45.364]  Not because Americans want this to happen to one of their staunchest allies, Pakistan.
[00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:49.049]  No, not at all, because that is not in their interest.
[00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.452]  But whose interest is being served in this case?
[00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:55.397]  It's amazing that Americans are paying in blood and money
[00:03:56.378 --> 00:04:14.625]  And in their reputation, in all the dreams that Americans have been harboring, they have to pay a huge price simply to satisfy some of those spoiled child children, two of them, mainly Israel, because Israel has brought India on board and so on and so forth.
[00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:17.906]  So you've got to be very careful that we don't go over the brink.
[00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:26.405]  General Hamid Gul again is our guest and he's going to be with us for two long segments coming up after this break.
[00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:30.248]  And we'll recap all of this, General, and get into the incredible developments.
[00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:35.513]  Why would they attack that Pakistani military base and kill more than 24 people?
[00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:36.193]  We'll cover that
[00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.756]  With really the top expert.
[00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:47.486]  The establishment hates their former ally General Hamid Gul so much they've called him the real head of Al-Qaeda, which of course is a complete fabricated joke.
[00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:52.652]  We know Al-Qaeda has been given control of Libya and is now attacking Syria and works for the globalists.
[00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:53.213]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:02.202]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:10.663]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:11.403 --> 00:05:15.444]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:26.846]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:36.488]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:42.029]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:49.591]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.312]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:01.478]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:04.879]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.921]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:16.144]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:16.324 --> 00:06:18.565]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:20.407]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:21.228]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:23.370]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:39.830]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.936]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:54.469]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:57.156 --> 00:06:59.217]  Attention shoppers, please stay in line.
[00:06:59.397 --> 00:07:02.158]  You must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area.
[00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:06.780]  Attention, you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering the building.
[00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:12.303]  Hey, most GCN listeners know that the future of Christmas shopping may quite well be that scary.
[00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:18.206]  And while we're not there yet, as shoppers we still face terrible traffic, crazy lines, and even crazier shoppers.
[00:07:18.386 --> 00:07:19.847]  But this year can be different.

[00:07:57.056 --> 00:08:01.779]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:04.501]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:20.591]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen, and we've got a very important guest right out of the gates today.
[00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:23.433]  It is Wednesday, the 30th day of November, 2011.
[00:08:26.754 --> 00:08:35.784]  And four days ago, today's the fifth day, there was an attack on another Pakistani military base, killing at least 24 people and injuring scores of others.
[00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:40.008]  There are NATO, CIA, U.S.
[00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:45.414]  Army drones flying around all over the place, killing people in Pakistan, Afghanistan, you name it.
[00:08:45.835 --> 00:08:48.497]  Total bedlam, an attempt to destabilize the country.
[00:08:49.858 --> 00:09:01.684]  And General Hamid Gul, former head of the Pakistani ISI, former frontline commander, also in a war with India decades before that, really the mastermind behind beating the Russians, a former big U.S.
[00:09:01.804 --> 00:09:05.726]  ally, has been called by major publications the real head of al-Qaeda.
[00:09:06.306 --> 00:09:08.368]  That's just, of course, absolutely asinine.
[00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:13.512]  And he joins us now to... I mean, we couldn't get any better expert.
[00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.755]  He's one of the main experts over in Pakistan on their national television.
[00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:22.420]  We couldn't get a better expert who's been there and seen it at every level to break down what's really going on.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.945]  And the times he's joined us in the last four years, he's always given us accurate assessments.
[00:09:28.386 --> 00:09:33.110]  We're getting the truth from General Gould, something we don't get from our occupied government.
[00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:45.848]  And so breaking down what this attack means, the supply lines being shut down from Pakistan into Afghanistan, the Russians shutting down supply lines, Russia threatening yesterday to attack Poland.
[00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:48.372]  They said, you know what, go ahead and move your missiles in.
[00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:50.464]  We're going to go ahead and attack.
[00:09:50.984 --> 00:09:51.684]  Go ahead and do it.
[00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:54.205]  I mean, this is huge escalations.
[00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:57.347]  So General Hamid Gul, General Gul joins us.
[00:09:57.387 --> 00:09:58.367]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:11.534]  Break down what happened with the attack, the incredible anger in Pakistan, the hardening of the line there in Pakistan, why you think this happened, and where it basically brings the world right now.
[00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:26.316]  Well, we can speculate on this, Alex, and the first hypothesis, as we call it in the military, the first possibility is that they want to extend war into Pakistan because they've been always calling AFPAK Battlefield.
[00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:32.302]  Now, naturally, they have been using their drones indiscriminately, killing nearly 3,500 people.
[00:10:34.444 --> 00:10:36.685]  And most of them very innocent people, really.
[00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:42.008]  There may be just a couple of dozen Al-Qaeda operators there, and low-level operators.
[00:10:42.088 --> 00:10:44.589]  There were no high-level operators, except one or two.
[00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:53.513]  The rest of the people were innocent Pakistani women and children, and their cattle and their properties all have been destroyed because of the drone attack.
[00:10:54.173 --> 00:11:00.416]  But unfortunately, in spite of Pakistan's democratic institution,
[00:11:00.996 --> 00:11:01.436]  We're good.
[00:11:17.888 --> 00:11:41.859]  So, in fact, it has damaged democracy in Pakistan so much, but this particular attack, it was the final nail in the coffin of our relationship.
[00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.420]  Why did they do that?
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.221]  That's the first hypothesis that I was saying.
[00:11:47.634 --> 00:12:00.519]  That they want to extend war into, it would be madness of the first order because that would push Pakistan into the lap of China for all you care, I mean politically, that's the political impact.
[00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:02.140]  The second case is that
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.603]  Is this war winnable if they open a front towards Pakistan in the 3-4?
[00:12:09.163 --> 00:12:18.548]  Is it possible at this time when America stands exhausted, their allies, European allies, they want to leave Afghanistan as quickly as possible?
[00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:22.330]  The economic situation in America is in shambles.
[00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.993]  The market forces are really not being able to pull themselves together.
[00:12:28.693 --> 00:12:47.958]  So this is a situation, this hypothesis I rule out, that they are prepared to, because if they continue to push this way, Pakistan, against the wall, then Pakistan may well, Alex I'm telling you, may turn out to be China's Israel in the future, and that is not
[00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:55.310]  I mean, this is a horrendous scenario which must be avoided.
[00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.673]  The other thing is that, then why have they done this?
[00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:17.186]  Because if it is ridiculous to come in for an attack at this time, the second hypothesis, and I think my leading hypothesis is that there is a tussle going on between the White House and the Pentagon and the Newcombs and the lobbyists of Israel and India.
[00:13:18.247 --> 00:13:25.830]  They are somehow, they are pissed against the withdrawal and particularly quick withdrawal.
[00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.932]  They want America to hang on, pay in blood and money.
[00:13:28.952 --> 00:13:32.793]  And there is another element which is very interesting.
[00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:34.514]  These are the security contractors.
[00:13:36.435 --> 00:13:47.564]  100,000 and 5,000 more, I mean 105,000 security contractors are now making hay in Afghanistan because there's so much money unaccounted for which goes into their pockets.
[00:13:48.005 --> 00:13:49.266]  And who are these guys?
[00:13:49.346 --> 00:13:56.452]  They are the ex-FBI, the ex-former CIA, and former military men.
[00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:59.153]  So they are making a lot of money.
[00:13:59.193 --> 00:14:10.896]  These old cronies of the serving generals are now really into—their hand is in the tail, and they are making immeasurably amount of money.
[00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:14.937]  And there is another group, and these are security contractors also.
[00:14:15.197 --> 00:14:20.138]  They are in cahoots with the smugglers, the drug traffickers.
[00:14:20.838 --> 00:14:33.264]  And last year, the volume of opium produced in Afghanistan was 6,500 tons, which was down to 50 tons in the last year of Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
[00:14:34.997 --> 00:14:44.303]  So these 6,500 tons of opium on the open market would fetch something like, as a raw opium, it would fetch something like $5 billion.
[00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:57.232]  Now, this is a huge amount of money, but I am surprised that there has been no halt because Pakistan has been traditionally the narcotic route towards Karachi and beyond.
[00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.214]  But for the last six, seven years,
[00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:03.156]  There has been no big haul in Pakistan.
[00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:04.717]  No catches in Pakistan.
[00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:10.942]  So how is this so much of opium going across?
[00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:13.443]  Because this is 90% of world supply.
[00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:16.986]  General, General, let me stop you there.
[00:15:18.007 --> 00:15:20.689]  Because you obviously don't see a lot of US television.
[00:15:20.729 --> 00:15:22.490]  You can just type in US troops protect
[00:15:24.151 --> 00:15:37.602]  Uh, poppies or protect opium into YouTube or Google, you will get BBC, CBS, ABC, and they just show the reporters going, in a new policy, and this is the last five years, we help grow it.
[00:15:37.982 --> 00:15:39.323]  We don't discuss where it's shipped.
[00:15:39.463 --> 00:15:40.004]  It's freedom.
[00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:51.036]  So, they're publicly, I'm not kidding, I know it's crazy, they ship it here and then when they catch people using it they throw them in prisons owned by the very banks that launder the drug money.
[00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:57.143]  So it's a new level of drug dealing where they actually, the drug dealers actually put you in their prisons.
[00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:59.166]  So obviously they want to stay there.
[00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:04.330]  It's about the hundreds of billions of street value a year, as you said, 90% of opium production.
[00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:11.356]  But where is it going now that they've attacked this base, now that the Russians are doing this?
[00:16:11.917 --> 00:16:20.084]  Where do you see the situation in Afghanistan going as resistance mounts as we go into the 11th year coming up?
[00:16:21.443 --> 00:16:37.928]  Yes, now this is a very precarious situation and I said that China has also come out strongly in favour of Pakistan and I described to you that China over time may become to Pakistan like America is to Israel.
[00:16:38.468 --> 00:16:43.669]  So, Pakistan will have no choice than to come under the umbrella of China.
[00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:50.271]  And China, obviously, is not disinterested with the amount of money they have, and they're flexing their muscles here and there.
[00:16:50.851 --> 00:17:02.793]  And this would keep India on the wrong side of history, because India is being backed by America, and America is losing the war, they're losing their image, and they are being threatened from now all directions.
[00:17:02.893 --> 00:17:05.794]  I think, look at the timing in which they have attacked Pakistan.
[00:17:07.055 --> 00:17:10.699]  It means they have hurt themselves more than anyone can hurt them.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.805]  But at a time when 10,000 troops were to be withdrawn by 31st of December.
[00:17:16.825 --> 00:17:18.227]  So what happened to that?
[00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:24.633]  Because there was an attempt to find a safe-saving formula by going to the border.
[00:17:24.653 --> 00:17:26.235]  Earlier on there was Istanbul.
[00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:27.797]  And what happened to Istanbul?
[00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:28.878]  It was a fiasco.
[00:17:29.418 --> 00:17:34.802]  And now it was born, and born is no go without Pakistan's participation.
[00:17:35.202 --> 00:17:40.406]  So the net result is that you have lost so much diplomatically, politically.
[00:17:40.966 --> 00:17:44.409]  Already economic loss is very much staring you in the eyes.
[00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.771]  And now you are strategically beginning to lose.
[00:17:48.252 --> 00:17:51.694]  So this is a very difficult situation for America today.
[00:17:52.074 --> 00:17:58.139]  I think if they don't set their bearings right, it is going to hurt them a lot more than it appears at the moment.
[00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:08.644]  But let me stop you, General, because, look, I mean, I know you're sophisticated and the Pakistani people are sophisticated, but we have been seized by the big six megabanks.
[00:18:08.684 --> 00:18:15.346]  They are imploding Europe and bragging that Goldman Sachs, the main Federal Reserve owner, has conquered Europe through fraud.
[00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:16.207]  That's in our news.
[00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:18.508]  They are militarizing the police.
[00:18:18.948 --> 00:18:21.009]  They are setting up checkpoints in America.
[00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.872]  They are saying they can arrest us, torture us, publicly now.
[00:18:25.252 --> 00:18:28.755]  I mean, this is some of the most brazen tyranny ever seen.
[00:18:30.447 --> 00:18:51.273]  being publicly announced like it's no big deal so clearly the folks in Pakistan need to know America has been seized by a global criminal interest that wants to destroy America's name that wants to destroy Pakistan and I don't know how worldwide we fight such a threat that works through hijacked nations playing them off against each other.
[00:18:52.947 --> 00:19:08.524]  Yeah, Alex, the tenacitor element, the dark element in American society, which is deep into it, they have gotten control and clout over all the policymaking, is somehow now so strong, you may have to fight for your freedom afresh.
[00:19:09.185 --> 00:19:22.261]  So, it is amazing that such a lot of things are happening, and the American people are still not—there is no movement like moratorium way back in the days of President Nixon.
[00:19:22.842 --> 00:19:24.224]  There has to be a movement.
[00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:27.408]  The people of America have to rise against their own policies.
[00:19:28.028 --> 00:19:29.508]  We're good to go.
[00:19:52.433 --> 00:20:03.562]  America seems to be on self-destruct, but it is not because of the American people who are very innocent and very nice, very humane, very nice people to begin with.
[00:20:03.582 --> 00:20:10.268]  I think they respect democracy, they respect the human rights of other people as much as they respect their own rights.
[00:20:10.928 --> 00:20:12.430]  Then who is doing all this?
[00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:31.426]  We generally know who is there, but this confederation of, I would say, thugs and swindlers, cheats, this is now getting the upper hand, unfortunately, and they are, as you very rightly said, they're destroying America and they're destroying the world.
[00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:33.391]  Well, yes, sir.
[00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:38.673]  The main financial advisor to Obama is Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, the former head of Goldman Sachs.
[00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:44.815]  He made a 40-to-1 bet with MF Global money just to show the reckless psychology of these people.
[00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:55.559]  And when it didn't go well, the government allowed him to take private bank accounts and brokerage accounts of people in sub-companies that MF Global had bought.
[00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:57.560]  And I've had financial experts on.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.300]  The news admits
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.381]  It's illegal, but the government's going to let them do this.
[00:21:01.801 --> 00:21:10.545]  I mean, that's what's scary is that when you realize these swindlers and bank fraud people that run everything, they don't know military tactics.
[00:21:11.025 --> 00:21:12.586]  They're losing touch.
[00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:14.487]  And it's been multiple U.S.
[00:21:14.547 --> 00:21:19.269]  generals, Admiral Fox Fallon and others, who refused to attack Iran.
[00:21:19.449 --> 00:21:21.850]  The only reason we didn't do this earlier.
[00:21:23.001 --> 00:21:27.830]  I mean that's what I'm saying is these people are insane and I don't know how we get rid of them.
[00:21:28.832 --> 00:21:30.675]  Minus another George Washington 1776.
[00:21:34.008 --> 00:21:35.308]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:41.790]  But look at the character of the generals at this time who are in office, in charge at this moment in Afghanistan.
[00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:55.915]  If they play along with these elements, as I described, the dark elements, the sinister elements within the American policymaking body, then I think they are not being loyal to their own country.
[00:21:56.055 --> 00:21:57.275]  They are not doing their duty.
[00:21:57.755 --> 00:22:00.516]  Because you have to always weigh the cause and effect.
[00:22:01.016 --> 00:22:03.218]  What is the cause and what is going to be the effect?
[00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:06.440]  And on that scale, they are net losers.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.681]  America is a net loser.
[00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:12.745]  So why are they doing things which will eventually put America in a hole?
[00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:19.070]  This is a very peculiar situation which has to be handled and which has to be addressed by the people of America.
[00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:24.214]  Nobody else can chastise them other than the American people themselves.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.164]  General Hamid Gul is our guest for another 10 minutes and we appreciate him giving us time here today.
[00:22:29.204 --> 00:22:30.465]  Very busy person.
[00:22:31.285 --> 00:22:44.216]  I mean really when you study psychology, you study history, as a general, as a former head of a famous intelligence agency who was very successful defeating the KGB, NKVD, the Russian military, all of them, you have to know the enemy.
[00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:53.024]  So looking at your enemy, the global megabanks, my enemy, the global megabanks, this global corporate globalism, they do want to destroy America while using us
[00:22:53.624 --> 00:22:55.666]  to carry out the next phase of their operation.
[00:22:55.906 --> 00:23:00.391]  They've moved our industry to China, so it is part of a larger double-cross.
[00:23:00.411 --> 00:23:05.415]  They're gonna implode America just like Europe next, but they want a war in the middle of that.
[00:23:05.796 --> 00:23:14.264]  Knowing the enemy, and that's the key as you know to winning a war and having supply lines, you know, those two paramount peaks together, those twin peaks,
[00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:20.477]  What concerns me, General, is now I see delusion in the elite.
[00:23:20.877 --> 00:23:25.760]  There's still a strategy, and I see the gambits, but it doesn't make sense in the end.
[00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:32.445]  Even if command destruction, order out of chaos, is their overall excuse, it isn't going to work.
[00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:36.147]  I mean, the Russians now are threatening to start attacking countries.
[00:23:37.468 --> 00:23:40.530]  And history shows the Russians will do things like that.
[00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.811]  I mean, this is so dangerous.
[00:23:43.752 --> 00:23:44.513]  Greed and fear.
[00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:44.914]  Greed and fear.
[00:24:00.296 --> 00:24:09.603]  There is a fear in Israel, there is a fear in India that if the Americans leave, they will be standing absolutely perched on the wrong side of history.
[00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:16.269]  And as far as the banks are concerned, and corrupt corporate America, corrupt corporate Europe,
[00:24:16.929 --> 00:24:19.971]  The corporate world is despicable.
[00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:27.114]  Now this really, it is tantamount to, virtually, if you translate it, it's spirit.
[00:24:27.234 --> 00:24:28.315]  That means corruption.
[00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:32.897]  So they are so corrupt that now you can't redeem them.
[00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:34.478]  You've got to demolish them.
[00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:36.299]  Because you have to survive.
[00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:37.479]  The nations have to survive.
[00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:38.640]  America has to survive.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.521]  It is important that America survives.
[00:24:41.221 --> 00:24:43.643]  Then these elements have to be cut out.
[00:24:44.403 --> 00:24:46.424]  There has to be surgical operation against them.
[00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:56.463]  Well, they're certainly waging war against free humanity and every basic liberty and overthrowing the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution right now.
[00:24:57.124 --> 00:25:04.074]  But I guess in the final equation, General, the good news is everything that they're touching is turning to garbage.
[00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:07.159]  Yes indeed it is, it is.
[00:25:07.179 --> 00:25:19.263]  Because this act of four days ago when they struck our security post on the border, I think this has really turned the scale against them.
[00:25:19.843 --> 00:25:23.144]  And now they can't, now it has to be reckoned with.
[00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:24.805]  You have to be now.
[00:25:25.485 --> 00:25:30.749]  You have come to a point where it's a tilt point and you've got to change your ways.
[00:25:31.289 --> 00:25:37.413]  And you've got not to listen to those people who have been putting America in the wrong track, on the wrong posse.
[00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.760]  Now, could there be another strategy?
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:53.911]  I mean, it looks like a bungle, but could the strategy be try to create political discord to destabilize the government of Pakistan as a desperate fleeing forward to start a new war with Pakistan?
[00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:56.112]  I mean, could this be conscious?
[00:25:56.133 --> 00:26:01.457]  Because they've done this, what, three or four times now in the last year, killing Pakistani troops, correct?
[00:26:02.597 --> 00:26:14.823]  My dear Alex, if this was the design, then I think it has failed miserably because it has put the Pakistani government and Pakistan Armed Forces on the same page.
[00:26:14.963 --> 00:26:24.267]  If there was any daylight, on account of this famous memo that was written by Hussain Attani, our ambassador in America,
[00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:32.795]  There was a daylight between the armed forces, the establishment, and the political government, but that is gone now.
[00:26:32.835 --> 00:26:47.831]  With this one act, the Americans have really brought the whole nation, alerted them, everybody's out on the streets, people are shouting against America, there was already no love lost for American policies, but now I think it has really crossed all limits.
[00:26:49.477 --> 00:26:52.101]  In closing, what's your view on an Iran strike?
[00:26:52.181 --> 00:26:54.924]  Israel's moving their Jericho missiles into firing position.
[00:26:54.945 --> 00:26:57.248]  My intel from people in U.S.
[00:26:57.308 --> 00:27:00.011]  intelligence is currently the green light's on.
[00:27:02.194 --> 00:27:03.136]  What's your take on that?
[00:27:03.976 --> 00:27:05.177]  No, no, they will never do that.
[00:27:05.297 --> 00:27:06.478]  They can't defeat Iran.
[00:27:06.898 --> 00:27:10.320]  They have 278 sites which will have to be taken out.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.701]  That is impossible.
[00:27:11.721 --> 00:27:18.305]  Then 60% of oil supplies of the world can be cut off in a couple of days by Iran.
[00:27:18.325 --> 00:27:21.527]  No way that they can win this.
[00:27:21.647 --> 00:27:25.649]  It will be a sheer madness, and America must take care of this.
[00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:26.730]  If Israel wants to do it,
[00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.011]  Leave them.
[00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:28.431]  Tell them.
[00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:29.192]  Give them the warning.
[00:27:29.712 --> 00:27:33.135]  If you do it, go it alone, then we will not be with you.
[00:27:33.275 --> 00:27:34.015]  It's your business.
[00:27:34.095 --> 00:27:34.756]  You want to do it.
[00:27:35.156 --> 00:27:39.560]  And they were rubbed so badly in the south of Lebanon in 2006.
[00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:43.483]  How dare they do it if the Americans don't go ahead to them?
[00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:47.966]  Well, yes, that's what Mullen, when he left, told him, don't do it, it's crazy.
[00:27:48.006 --> 00:27:49.347]  Panetta's told him it's crazy.
[00:27:49.887 --> 00:27:53.570]  The former head of Mossad, they removed him because he said it was crazy just a year ago.
[00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.231]  And that's what I'm being told.
[00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:57.492]  Everyone's telling him it's crazy.
[00:27:57.812 --> 00:28:05.658]  It's going to unify all the Arabs, all of the Persians, all of the Central Asians.
[00:28:06.078 --> 00:28:06.758]  Don't do it.
[00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:12.182]  But Netanyahu thinks he's going to be like Churchill and that it's going to make America come to his aid.
[00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:17.277]  I think he should be summoned to America and put through a psychiatric test.
[00:28:17.437 --> 00:28:18.958]  I think this man is psycho.
[00:28:19.638 --> 00:28:26.902]  He has got to be reined in for the love of this world, for the love of freedom, for the love of people of America and the rest of the world.
[00:28:28.643 --> 00:28:33.126]  Well, if everybody, even in the establishment, is smart enough to tell him not to do this,
[00:28:35.596 --> 00:28:40.184]  Well, we do know there's covert bombings going on against the facilities right now in Iran.
[00:28:40.204 --> 00:28:42.168]  That's now basically being admitted.
[00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:44.752]  What's your view on Iran just taking this?
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:29:01.856]  No, Iran is showing restraint, and I think it's just as well, but I was in Iran only a month back, and I found that the nation is unperturbed about all the threats which are being dished out to them.
[00:29:02.396 --> 00:29:08.923]  They are united, and whatever there was a little fissure politically in the society,
[00:29:09.463 --> 00:29:15.605]  That immediately has disappeared after the threat from Israel and they have closed their ranks.
[00:29:15.785 --> 00:29:18.186]  Now they are even more united than before.
[00:29:18.646 --> 00:29:20.466]  So, really, I don't know.
[00:29:21.046 --> 00:29:22.507]  I don't think Israel will do that.
[00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:23.227]  I hope not.
[00:29:23.447 --> 00:29:23.987]  I hope not.
[00:29:24.067 --> 00:29:29.809]  I really, for the sake of humanity and for the future of mankind, I hope this never happens.
[00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:33.292]  All right, General Hamid Gul, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:29:33.332 --> 00:29:40.999]  Hopefully, you can update us as big developments take place, and I hope we can all have peace and friendship worldwide between Americans and Pakistanis.
[00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:41.500]  Thank you, sir.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.261]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:29:43.622 --> 00:29:43.902]  Bye-bye.
[00:29:44.162 --> 00:29:44.462]  Thank you.
[00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:45.163]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:45.904 --> 00:29:46.804]  We're on the march.
[00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:48.886]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.827 --> 00:29:52.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.608 --> 00:30:04.451]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:06.991]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:07.252 --> 00:30:12.453]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:12.633 --> 00:30:15.414]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:15.674 --> 00:30:17.735]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:17.995 --> 00:30:23.919]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:27.441]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:27.621 --> 00:30:33.145]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:33.405 --> 00:30:34.706]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:36.267]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:36.347 --> 00:30:38.888]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:39.009 --> 00:30:43.071]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:43.231 --> 00:30:45.853]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:30:45.973 --> 00:30:46.734]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[00:32:00.345 --> 00:32:01.266]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:01.606 --> 00:32:05.229]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:07.771]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:13.235]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:13.655 --> 00:32:19.900]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:25.825]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:26.285 --> 00:32:29.948]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:30.468 --> 00:32:34.452]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:40.256]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:40.697 --> 00:32:43.839]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.681]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:46.241 --> 00:32:46.662]  It's here.

[00:33:34.837 --> 00:33:36.324]  Wipe the blood from your hands!
[00:33:53.974 --> 00:33:57.416]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:33:57.576 --> 00:33:59.196]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:59.256 --> 00:34:02.358]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:34:02.398 --> 00:34:09.401]  We've got Mankal Muller, Eric Mankal Muller, syndicated radio host, joining us for the first 20 minutes of the next hour.
[00:34:09.461 --> 00:34:15.724]  Then Lyndon LaRouche is joining us, and then we'll have open phones for large portions of the third hour today.
[00:34:16.684 --> 00:34:22.008]  In fact, I'll probably even try to take some calls while Len LaRouche is on with us if you have any economic questions.
[00:34:22.448 --> 00:34:36.559]  Again, I don't endorse some of LaRouche's solutions, but his analysis of who runs the world, the eugenics, population control program, they were one of the first groups 30 years ago to accurately track exactly what was going on.
[00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:40.860]  And I'd read their stuff 16, 17 years ago and go, oh, this isn't true.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.541]  And I separately, doing my own original research, found that they were telling the truth.
[00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:51.402]  And it's, again, some people go to Disney World and say, I discovered Disney World.
[00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:52.822]  You know, you discover it for yourself.
[00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:54.923]  I'm not even saying I found original stuff.
[00:34:54.963 --> 00:34:59.284]  I'm saying I went out separately and kept running in to this information.
[00:34:59.604 --> 00:35:01.804]  They've got it dead bang on.
[00:35:03.325 --> 00:35:04.045]  Dead bang on.
[00:35:05.444 --> 00:35:14.628]  And of course, LaRouche was also advisor to Ronald Reagan, of all people, and was the CIA director, called him the best private intelligence analyst and all the stuff in the Washington Post.
[00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:19.610]  And boy, the government, George, Herbert Walker Bush got jealous and they threw his butt in prison.
[00:35:22.151 --> 00:35:23.672]  Now we've got a bunch of reports coming in.
[00:35:23.792 --> 00:35:27.094]  Foreclosure fraud whistleblower has been found dead, MSNBC.
[00:35:28.744 --> 00:35:32.647]  Uh, is reporting just incredible information on that front.
[00:35:32.747 --> 00:35:34.048]  More news on Fukushima.
[00:35:34.428 --> 00:35:37.210]  Radiation risks are severely underestimated.
[00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.011]  Uh, no kidding, we're going to be getting into all of that.
[00:35:41.552 --> 00:35:52.800]  We've got incredible federal orders now, basically following the orders of Herr Lieberman, uh, to extrajudicially start delisting anti-government, quote,
[00:35:54.082 --> 00:35:58.786]  Uh, terror-supporting websites off the web, just delisting them so you can't find it.
[00:35:59.746 --> 00:36:05.170]  Uh, we're already been delisted from Google News, InfoWars.com and PrisonPanda.com in the last year.
[00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.853]  Uh, they've moved us down in the rankings even though we're number one.
[00:36:09.674 --> 00:36:19.261]  Uh, they're doing everything they can, but now there's government announcements that they're ordering that hold databases of terms they give Google be delisted.
[00:36:20.168 --> 00:36:23.150]  And this is kind of an a la carte internet kill switch.
[00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:28.654]  I've got that in the news that I'm going to raise with Man Cow and some other issues coming up in the next hour.
[00:36:28.714 --> 00:36:32.998]  But just huge developments that are taking place right now.
[00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:41.204]  That's why, more than ever, you've got to get the URL of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com out to everybody you can.
[00:36:41.904 --> 00:36:43.686]  Spray paint it on the side of your business.
[00:36:44.779 --> 00:36:48.124]  Uh, spray paint it on your billboard or the side of your barn if it's your property.
[00:36:49.326 --> 00:36:52.991]  Uh, you know, we don't say write it on bathroom stalls over the cuss words.
[00:36:53.031 --> 00:36:54.433]  You don't want to censor the cuss words.
[00:36:54.793 --> 00:36:55.294]  That's wrong.
[00:36:55.554 --> 00:37:00.801]  I'm not saying if there's some globalist homeland security, uh, billboard to climb upon it and spray paint it.
[00:37:02.323 --> 00:37:11.651]  We should let them have a Trader's Senate who says they're allowed to insider trade and be public criminals, pass laws saying citizens can be arrested, held forever, tortured, killed, whatever.
[00:37:12.812 --> 00:37:14.213]  George Washington would love that.
[00:37:15.794 --> 00:37:18.996]  We shouldn't do anything to try to resist this.
[00:37:19.076 --> 00:37:20.438]  Okay, I'm being sarcastic now.
[00:37:21.704 --> 00:37:31.808]  The point is, is that they're slowly accelerating their program and now they're getting pretty much to a jog now of censorship and control, blotting out thousands of domains a month.
[00:37:32.269 --> 00:37:33.009]  It is on.
[00:37:33.969 --> 00:37:34.790]  So that's coming up.
[00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.311]  Huge financial news as well.
[00:37:40.686 --> 00:37:46.948]  In fact, it's now in the news, Bloomberg, Fed lowers interest rate on dollar swaps.
[00:37:47.528 --> 00:37:56.551]  And if you look at this, it's basically just more free taxpayer money to the European Central Bank, which is really the same shareholders of the Federal Reserve.
[00:37:57.052 --> 00:37:59.572]  So it's just one hand giving it to the other hand.
[00:37:59.973 --> 00:38:02.573]  But the hands are attached to the same system.
[00:38:03.134 --> 00:38:06.815]  Fed lowers interest rate on dollar swaps.
[00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:16.078]  Six central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, lowered the cost of emergency dollar funding for financial companies in a global effort to ease Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
[00:38:16.518 --> 00:38:19.720]  And that sent the markets up, and then a week from now they'll be back down.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.981]  They'll be, give us another giant bailout!
[00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:25.842]  And the markets will go up, and then, oh, they went down a new crisis.
[00:38:26.422 --> 00:38:30.684]  As they take over every country and say, we'll fix your economy for a few weeks,
[00:38:33.357 --> 00:38:40.605]  If you just give us total sovereignty and promise to raise all your taxes to pay to the private banks who actually engineered the fraud.
[00:38:41.706 --> 00:38:43.689]  I mean, it's that brazen, it's that naked.
[00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.871]  Here's some of the other headlines.
[00:38:45.951 --> 00:38:47.673]  Bank downgrade rampage.
[00:38:47.793 --> 00:38:54.401]  Goldman, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup just got cut by S&P, Standard & Poor's.
[00:38:55.629 --> 00:39:02.311]  Senator Poor's rating service just cut the ratings of Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup from A to A-.
[00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:10.434]  So it was A+, then it was A, now it's A-, now you see the cities and counties and states starting to go bankrupt.
[00:39:10.594 --> 00:39:11.634]  It is beginning.
[00:39:12.639 --> 00:39:17.261]  And it'll all be imploded into this new global mega bank that issues global bonds.
[00:39:17.341 --> 00:39:19.903]  First a Europe bond, then a global bond.
[00:39:20.383 --> 00:39:24.885]  And they'll say, if you're tired of the depression, give your sovereignty over to the banks.
[00:39:25.345 --> 00:39:28.907]  And we're like, but wait, those are the same bankers that engineered this.
[00:39:29.708 --> 00:39:31.789]  Delist their website, shut them down.
[00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:36.071]  You know, we just got new government documents yesterday.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.081]  Which the government admits.
[00:39:40.062 --> 00:39:49.770]  They list mainline libertarian websites like antiwar.com, they list the Oklahoma City Bombing Investigative Committee headed up by State Rep.
[00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:59.638]  Charles Key, and it's got the former head of the Grand Jury, Hoppy Heidelberg, and victims and families, members of victims of Oklahoma City, who are there.
[00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:03.740]  So I'm saying, hey, we've got the footage of the bombs in the building on local news.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.201]  We've got police saying there were bombs.
[00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:08.562]  We've got the ATF showing up minutes after, dressed up in bomb gear.
[00:40:09.122 --> 00:40:16.285]  We've got the witnesses in the building saying they saw feds planting big gray sticks of butter who they said were telephone men the day before.
[00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:18.285]  McVeigh with known federal agents.
[00:40:18.665 --> 00:40:28.369]  You know, we've got all these federal memos that have been leaked and lawsuits that have gotten the four-year request that show the government was involved and the FBI head of counterterrorism was there that day.
[00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:30.611]  Lied about it publicly to Congress.
[00:40:31.191 --> 00:40:32.292]  We want an investigation.
[00:40:32.332 --> 00:40:34.054]  You know what Homeland Security has them listed as?
[00:40:34.454 --> 00:40:36.096]  Domestic terrorists.
[00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:37.317]  In fact, I want to get State Rep.
[00:40:37.337 --> 00:40:38.378]  Charles Key on about this.
[00:40:38.819 --> 00:40:40.901]  It says they are terrorists.
[00:40:41.221 --> 00:40:44.124]  It actually says, under domestic terrorism, Homeland Security.
[00:40:44.384 --> 00:40:46.506]  And they actually give this to every police department.
[00:40:47.527 --> 00:40:51.511]  Oh, officers, if they investigate the government blowing this up, they're terrorists.
[00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:52.712]  I mean,
[00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:58.034]  We have criminals in the government, bought and paid for by the mega banks.
[00:40:58.374 --> 00:41:00.715]  They're trying to fully convert us over to a tyranny.
[00:41:01.076 --> 00:41:05.058]  And the tunnel only gets deeper and darker if they... You understand?
[00:41:05.258 --> 00:41:06.198]  There's no America.
[00:41:06.399 --> 00:41:06.999]  There's no nothing.
[00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:08.900]  They want to destroy the free market.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.161]  They want you poor.
[00:41:10.381 --> 00:41:12.162]  They want to end the American dream.
[00:41:13.302 --> 00:41:18.645]  And cowardly going along with this is only going to empower the system.
[00:41:19.005 --> 00:41:20.766]  Do we have that RT clip from yesterday ready?
[00:41:22.827 --> 00:41:23.088]  We do?
[00:41:23.108 --> 00:41:23.288]  Good.
[00:41:24.372 --> 00:41:31.178]  On the nightly news last night, I played this clip and I played other senators admitting that yes, it's for U.S.
[00:41:31.198 --> 00:41:39.644]  citizens, including John McCain, and I want to get to that in a few minutes, and then Dew is converting the clips from last night's show, I forgot to tell him, so I can play them here.
[00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:43.066]  He's transferring them off that computer system over to this system.
[00:41:43.086 --> 00:41:45.427]  I don't know the files they have over there don't play over here.
[00:41:45.507 --> 00:42:02.033]  So we're waiting on those so that I can play you the clips that we put together for the nightly news last night of all these senators going, yes, this legislation does allow the secret arrest and permanent detention of Americans with no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[00:42:02.273 --> 00:42:03.653]  The army will rule America.
[00:42:04.473 --> 00:42:05.894]  Just absolute total tyranny.
[00:42:06.314 --> 00:42:12.401]  Just 100% secret arrest, you disappear, and they've said in other rulings, we can kill you, we can torture you.
[00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:18.349]  Just absolute Joseph Mingela level, off the charts, is North Korea.
[00:42:21.192 --> 00:42:21.813]  North Korea.
[00:42:23.191 --> 00:42:25.453]  And they'll try to, they'll slowly implement it, of course.
[00:42:25.493 --> 00:42:27.115]  It'll be a bad man.
[00:42:27.175 --> 00:42:28.656]  It'll be a child molester.
[00:42:28.716 --> 00:42:36.163]  It'll be an Al-Qaeda to say, well, you know, they don't deserve any due process, so that you never find out what really happened.
[00:42:36.263 --> 00:42:39.687]  I mean, just total 110% bondage.
[00:42:40.327 --> 00:42:45.192]  It says if you're suspected by any branch of the military, you're gone.
[00:42:46.445 --> 00:42:48.166]  And I have Rand Paul talking about it.
[00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:49.808]  I have McCain admitting it.
[00:42:49.888 --> 00:42:51.089]  I have Lindsey Graham admitting it.
[00:42:51.409 --> 00:42:52.110]  I have all the clips.
[00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:55.272]  And still... Oh, by the way, the bill passed the Senate.
[00:42:57.014 --> 00:43:00.757]  And it's going to go into conference, but the House passed a similar bill, so now it's going to go to Obama's desk.
[00:43:01.217 --> 00:43:02.258]  He says he's going to veto.
[00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:12.246]  Which I've got to say is good, but remember when they tried to give him this power last year, he said, well, I can still have secret arrest and kill American citizens abroad or domestically.
[00:43:12.546 --> 00:43:14.628]  I don't need Congress to pass this law.
[00:43:14.668 --> 00:43:15.669]  They tried to pass it last year.
[00:43:16.721 --> 00:43:20.863]  So, last year, I haven't seen Obama's threatened veto statement.
[00:43:21.164 --> 00:43:22.044]  It's not public yet.
[00:43:22.324 --> 00:43:23.565]  He just said, we'll have a veto.
[00:43:24.025 --> 00:43:26.547]  But I did see it last year and it was, I already have this authority.
[00:43:27.007 --> 00:43:28.307]  I don't need you to give it to me.
[00:43:29.728 --> 00:43:32.430]  So the lawyers are like, don't even have it under law.
[00:43:33.703 --> 00:43:37.064]  That implies that this tyrannical act could be repealed at some time.
[00:43:37.725 --> 00:43:42.287]  Execute it through the executive, just as you have done with the new wars you have launched.
[00:43:42.747 --> 00:43:43.787]  Don't call it war.
[00:43:43.867 --> 00:43:45.388]  Throw that in the slave's face.
[00:43:45.788 --> 00:43:48.069]  Destroy the meaning of logic and language.
[00:43:48.609 --> 00:43:49.090]  Sire!
[00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.930]  Of course, he's actually just a minion.
[00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:59.134]  Came out Rahm Emanuel, cracks his knuckles in meetings, bosses Obama around, verbally slaps him around, and of course Emanuel himself is a puppet.
[00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:01.895]  But that's basically the view.
[00:44:02.415 --> 00:44:06.877]  We will begin robo-signing even though it's been ruled to be illegal in your bills.
[00:44:06.957 --> 00:44:07.777]  Throw it in their face.
[00:44:08.217 --> 00:44:13.860]  No president has ever served as the head of the UN Security Council in its 60-year history plus.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.941]  But you will serve as the head of the rotating post.
[00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:22.844]  That's why they had the Rockefellers and they had Kissinger and Brzezinski.
[00:44:23.284 --> 00:44:24.084]  And I showed the clips.
[00:44:24.184 --> 00:44:25.525]  It's in Fall of the Republic.
[00:44:26.718 --> 00:44:27.998]  But they are there at the U.N.
[00:44:28.038 --> 00:44:30.719]  in New York, and they're shaking, they're laughing.
[00:44:30.939 --> 00:44:33.120]  Some of them have tears in their eyes, they're going, oh!
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:38.381]  And they actually said on the news, this is quite a moment for them, seeing the President over the U.N.
[00:44:38.781 --> 00:44:39.761]  while he's President.
[00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:45.943]  It's against Article 9, section, I forget, section on the back of Follow the Republic, hold on.
[00:44:48.423 --> 00:44:52.244]  I know a lot about the Constitution, but sometimes I, Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:44:52.264 --> 00:44:55.785]  Constitution, by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council.
[00:44:56.704 --> 00:44:58.625]  Again, he's brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9.
[00:44:59.886 --> 00:45:02.327]  The first president to chair the council.
[00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:07.430]  And, I mean, they had tears in their eyes.
[00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:21.197]  The level of squatting on us, and spitting in our face, and dragging us through the mud, and now they've introduced new legislation to openly say unlimited torture.
[00:45:23.919 --> 00:45:28.522]  For false confessions, terror, fear, they already have had federal and state courts rule.
[00:45:28.843 --> 00:45:31.424]  Police can taser you to make you answer questions.
[00:45:31.845 --> 00:45:32.926]  I thought there was a Fifth Amendment.
[00:45:33.006 --> 00:45:34.747]  No, you can actually type into the search engine.
[00:45:34.767 --> 00:45:35.868]  I've seen this in the last six years.
[00:45:36.308 --> 00:45:39.851]  In Florida, New York, and other states, they've had federal and state judges rule.
[00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:48.517]  Oh, the gentleman would not answer questions while at the hospital, so he was restrained and tasered 19 times until answering.
[00:45:49.673 --> 00:45:50.993]  Of course, that was because of a lawsuit.
[00:45:51.033 --> 00:45:57.895]  The guy had heart palpitations and a mild heart attack, and the judge said, we can kill you!
[00:45:58.555 --> 00:46:02.755]  And the media's saying, hey, let ESPN cover up child rape for 10 years.
[00:46:02.795 --> 00:46:04.496]  That's come out, and I've heard them defending it.
[00:46:05.076 --> 00:46:08.436]  You know, it came out with Syracuse and all this, the wife saying, yeah, he's raped kids in front of me.
[00:46:08.857 --> 00:46:10.877]  And the media's like, well, let ESPN cover that up.
[00:46:10.917 --> 00:46:11.537]  What's the big deal?
[00:46:12.057 --> 00:46:15.938]  Murder, torture, rape, death, tasering people, strap down.
[00:46:16.986 --> 00:46:18.788]  And it's just, it's just more evil.
[00:46:18.828 --> 00:46:24.694]  They're going to start taking the bank accounts, they're going to start grabbing more of your kids, they're going to unloose every evil force you can imagine.
[00:46:25.074 --> 00:46:27.337]  Forced abortions, all of it coming to America.
[00:46:27.657 --> 00:46:29.239]  Forced inoculations, all of it.
[00:46:29.259 --> 00:46:31.060]  They're already saying in the news.
[00:46:32.395 --> 00:46:39.918]  Oh, well, if you're on welfare, because they've created this meme of these lazy welfare people having kids, it's like, oh, you get to have welfare, but now you have to have an abortion.
[00:46:40.519 --> 00:47:00.007]  Or, oh, this child was 70 pounds overweight, you know, he was 200 pounds in the third grade, doesn't matter, his dad's, you know, 6 foot 5 and stocky, sure, he's a little overweight, we're going to go ahead and take your child and put him on an amphetamine and basically burn out their brain and heart to make them lose, you know, 80 pounds or whatever.
[00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:05.888]  And then next, you read the guidelines of your child's 1% over body weight, they're going to take them.
[00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:07.029]  It's all been announced.
[00:47:07.089 --> 00:47:10.072]  Again, they set the just maximum evil.
[00:47:10.632 --> 00:47:11.853]  Maximum evil.
[00:47:12.574 --> 00:47:13.654]  Evil isn't funny.
[00:47:14.255 --> 00:47:15.316]  Evil isn't a joke.
[00:47:15.876 --> 00:47:16.877]  Evil isn't cute.
[00:47:17.477 --> 00:47:18.398]  Evil isn't fun.
[00:47:18.698 --> 00:47:19.799]  Hitler's not fun.
[00:47:20.159 --> 00:47:21.140]  Mao's not fun.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.681]  Stalin's not fun.
[00:47:23.462 --> 00:47:24.903]  Kim Jong-il's not fun.
[00:47:25.744 --> 00:47:27.245]  None of this is fun.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:38.263]  Turning loose psychopaths, and sociopaths, and control freaks, and masochists, and sadists is not fun.
[00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:44.825]  See, every culture for thousands of years, these people manifest something.
[00:47:45.585 --> 00:47:46.305]  It's a tropism.
[00:47:46.965 --> 00:47:55.468]  They manifest black uniforms, bloodletting, war, sacrifice, death, because for the 1% who are psychopaths, it is beautiful.
[00:47:59.269 --> 00:48:01.010]  And they want it, so they're gonna get it.
[00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:08.514]  Now, before I get to the latest on this, let me just play a short clip when I was on RT yesterday, and some people said, Alex, you got upset towards the end of the clip.
[00:48:08.554 --> 00:48:09.295]  Why'd you get upset?
[00:48:10.055 --> 00:48:17.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, because they were set to pass the bill, and they did pass it, and something's wrong with you if you don't get upset.
[00:48:17.419 --> 00:48:20.481]  The full clip's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:23.027 --> 00:48:31.218]  Something's wrong with you if you don't get upset when the most hard core legal tyranny is put into place.
[00:48:32.799 --> 00:48:37.782]  I mean, that the Senate would say, we can arrest citizens secretly, and I mean, you literally disappear.
[00:48:38.022 --> 00:48:38.682]  Where's Bob?
[00:48:38.722 --> 00:48:39.323]  We don't know.
[00:48:39.723 --> 00:48:42.524]  There's rumors that people that are disappearing are going to facilities.
[00:48:42.585 --> 00:48:44.025]  I mean, right out of North Korea.
[00:48:44.586 --> 00:48:45.566]  Right out of Nazi Germany.
[00:48:45.826 --> 00:48:50.249]  I mean, this is as, as, this is the Heisman Trophy of tyranny.
[00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:52.810]  This is the Super Bowl MVP.
[00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.951]  This isn't just Super Bowl level tyranny.
[00:48:55.172 --> 00:48:57.053]  This is MVP tyranny.
[00:48:57.933 --> 00:48:59.194]  This is creme de la creme.
[00:48:59.214 --> 00:49:07.558]  This is as certified, 100%, if the New World Order was a bull rider, they'd be 10 times champion.
[00:49:07.578 --> 00:49:09.639]  Of course, nobody's 10 times champion.
[00:49:10.159 --> 00:49:11.159]  Not even Bobby Steiner.
[00:49:11.199 --> 00:49:18.203]  But the point is, this is 10 times world bull riding champion here.
[00:49:18.243 --> 00:49:19.343]  I mean, this is it.
[00:49:20.364 --> 00:49:21.844]  People are like, well, what's the big deal?
[00:49:21.864 --> 00:49:23.485]  The birds are still going to be tweeting tomorrow.
[00:49:23.685 --> 00:49:25.206]  Yeah, they're going to slowly implement it.
[00:49:26.434 --> 00:49:29.735]  And then if they're able to get their plan fully in, they're going to unload this stuff.
[00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:31.635]  First, they're going to start shutting down the web.
[00:49:31.855 --> 00:49:33.335]  They're going to start censoring talk radio.
[00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:35.416]  They'll use case point examples to sell it.
[00:49:35.696 --> 00:49:40.297]  Let's go to this little clip of Senator Lindsey Graham saying, yeah, it's for U.S.
[00:49:40.317 --> 00:49:40.817]  citizens.
[00:49:41.657 --> 00:49:42.217]  Here's the clip.
[00:49:42.237 --> 00:49:45.738]  Exactly simple language here.
[00:49:46.258 --> 00:49:51.299]  So why don't I play something for you from one of the bill's backers, Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina.
[00:49:51.319 --> 00:49:53.679]  This is what he said on the Senate floor a few weeks ago.
[00:49:56.115 --> 00:50:03.846]  1032, the military custody provision, which has waivers and a lot of flexibility, doesn't apply to American citizens.
[00:50:03.866 --> 00:50:11.857]  1031, the statement of authority to detain, does apply to American citizens, and it designates the world as the battlefield, including the homeland.
[00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:17.432]  The battlefield, says Senator Graham, is right here, in your front yard.
[00:50:17.872 --> 00:50:21.634]  And I've got McCain admitting it and others admitting it.
[00:50:21.734 --> 00:50:22.534]  It's in the language.
[00:50:22.574 --> 00:50:25.996]  It says, you're exempt from this unless we say so.
[00:50:26.796 --> 00:50:31.758]  And then you've got the previous Enemy Commissions, Military Commissions Act, all this stuff.
[00:50:31.798 --> 00:50:35.780]  It says, it's not for citizens, but we strip you of the citizenship extrajudicially.
[00:50:36.721 --> 00:50:37.482]  And then it's secret.
[00:50:38.022 --> 00:50:40.765]  I mean, they already are killing American citizens abroad.
[00:50:41.186 --> 00:50:42.968]  Now they're saying they're going to kill us domestically.
[00:50:44.469 --> 00:50:48.494]  The Israelis told Reuters five years ago, they said, we'll kill U.S.
[00:50:48.534 --> 00:50:49.415]  citizens in America.
[00:50:49.715 --> 00:50:50.215]  And the U.S.
[00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:51.176]  government said, go ahead.
[00:50:51.817 --> 00:50:52.958]  I mean, come on, wake up.
[00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:54.140]  Don't live in denial.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.061]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:56.775 --> 00:51:01.779]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:02.501 --> 00:52:05.104]  How well is your family prepared for a food crisis?

[00:53:01.747 --> 00:53:04.129]  That requires being tough and thinking smart.

[00:54:08.539 --> 00:54:14.044]  Okay, so I just played you Lindsey Graham playing his little lawyer game with you, Mr. Carbon Tax.
[00:54:15.445 --> 00:54:16.406]  Mr. Open Borders.
[00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:25.465]  I just played you the clip, and later I'm going to play some of the other clips where McCain and others admit it's for U.S.
[00:54:25.505 --> 00:54:25.865]  citizens.
[00:54:25.905 --> 00:54:39.758]  But notice, this was always there, but when they wanted to get it passed and they didn't want opposition to mount, they came out last week and said it wasn't in there, some of the Republican and Democratic leadership, and they had operatives online in a disinformation campaign.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.142]  Most of them paid bloggers and Pentagon people.
[00:54:44.608 --> 00:54:47.429]  And they've got a script, they go follow it, they say this isn't true.
[00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:56.514]  Just to make the debate about whether it's true or not, so that people don't then have a debate about, do we want to be secretly arrested and disappear forever and be tortured?
[00:54:57.194 --> 00:55:08.760]  Now, they're going ahead with torture, and of course they denied torture at first, then it came out the White House ordered it, so they went ahead and burned some of their own minions in all of this.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.682]  And now the Senate's considering Bill authorizing more torture.
[00:55:15.489 --> 00:55:25.755]  And the law enforcement magazines we've shown you actually create situational ethics, and then the TV shows do as well, part of the brainwashing, where you torture people's kids, which did go on at Abu Ghraib.
[00:55:26.335 --> 00:55:29.357]  If they can get the security services to torture kids, they got them.
[00:55:30.938 --> 00:55:36.501]  And, of course, it turned out they hired a lot of former federal prison guards and others who'd been caught raping people and stuff, and that's who they are.
[00:55:36.521 --> 00:55:40.603]  In fact, it's in the news today, TSA whistleblower, feds covered up sexual assault.
[00:55:41.643 --> 00:55:44.185]  And it gets into, they're not just raping the public.
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:55.668]  in those back rooms or on the street in their uniform or on the parking lot of the airports and they flash their badge and just say, I have a, they've been quoted as saying, I have a administrative privilege.
[00:55:55.748 --> 00:55:56.508]  I'm going to rape you.
[00:55:58.690 --> 00:55:59.891]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[00:56:00.371 --> 00:56:06.535]  They've gone crazy multiple times, been stripping down naked and in one case at LAX screaming, I'm God, I'm God.
[00:56:06.555 --> 00:56:10.218]  I mean, that's the type of folks who want to grab grandma's genitals all day.
[00:56:11.548 --> 00:56:16.230]  I mean, I didn't know they stacked maggots that high, but they do.
[00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.712]  And a lot of the TSA people apologize when I go through.
[00:56:20.732 --> 00:56:21.892]  Oh, Alex, we know what's going on.
[00:56:21.912 --> 00:56:22.712]  We want to unionize.
[00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:23.993]  We know this is a joke.
[00:56:24.953 --> 00:56:29.615]  But then they always have that special one they call over when you say opt out or whatever, who enjoys it.
[00:56:30.816 --> 00:56:36.778]  But flying out of Austrian Bergstrom a month ago, I ran into one that was like, oh, we got a troublemaker, Alex Jones!
[00:56:37.637 --> 00:56:40.458]  There was some balding grey-haired guy and I was like, hey.
[00:56:40.958 --> 00:56:41.578]  He was like, eh.
[00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:42.498]  He thought he was intimidating.
[00:56:42.518 --> 00:56:43.938]  He was like, eh, yeah.
[00:56:43.958 --> 00:56:45.258]  And I was just laughing at him.
[00:56:45.278 --> 00:56:46.639]  I was like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:56:46.959 --> 00:56:56.581]  You must be the most pathetic creature in the galaxy to want to have this cowardly job where you can exercise petty power all day on real humans.
[00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:03.662]  My blood's 10 trillion times redder than yours, Mac, and you know it and you hate it.
[00:57:04.724 --> 00:57:07.725]  You can smell my red blood, you little psychic vampire, can't ya?
[00:57:11.367 --> 00:57:11.747]  Excuse me.
[00:57:14.288 --> 00:57:15.049]  I'm gonna settle down.
[00:57:16.465 --> 00:57:23.330]  Let me just point out, if you want to support us, but more importantly get the word out, all 18 of my films that are on DVD are available.
[00:57:24.091 --> 00:57:28.034]  18 DVDs, 18 films for $99.95, all of them.
[00:57:28.514 --> 00:57:35.960]  Police State 4, Terror Storm, Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Dark Secrets Inside Bloomington Grove, Order of Death, Endgame, on and on and on and on and on.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.240]  18 of them, $19.95.
[00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:41.184]  They're normally $19.95 a piece.
[00:57:41.664 --> 00:57:42.825]  Imagine that's $360.
[00:57:43.866 --> 00:57:48.629]  No, no, right now they are $99.95, a $260 discount.
[00:57:48.649 --> 00:57:53.792]  You get some bumper stickers, InfoWars.com, and you get Citizen Rulebook and other evil stuff like that.
[00:57:54.253 --> 00:57:59.556]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:57:59.997 --> 00:58:06.701]  We got two new films also that are only available at InfoWars.com, Scientists Under Attack, Genetic Engineering, and The Magnetic Field of Money.
[00:58:07.982 --> 00:58:10.965]  Outside the Law, Stories from Guantanamo, very powerful film.
[00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:14.148]  Both of these available at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:14.168 --> 00:58:16.510]  So spread the gift of information.
[00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:21.714]  Don't give somebody wild turkey or fruit pie or whatever they are, fruitcake.
[00:58:21.834 --> 00:58:25.618]  Give them some real info and support the InfoWars here at the command base.
[00:58:25.978 --> 00:58:34.065]  And we've got running for just two more days, 15-day free trial right now at PrisonPlanet.tv to see the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:39.108 --> 00:58:42.870]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:46.792 --> 00:58:52.236]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:53.436 --> 00:58:58.199]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:58:58.579 --> 00:59:05.243]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:09.509]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:59:11.376 --> 00:59:13.684]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.683]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:59:20.404 --> 00:59:23.526]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:25.068]  Others don't.
[00:59:25.468 --> 00:59:27.349]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.111]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:31.973]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:32.273 --> 00:59:38.538]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:38.919 --> 00:59:41.121]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:41.621 --> 00:59:43.663]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[00:59:43.983 --> 00:59:44.483]  Others don't.
[00:59:49.241 --> 00:59:51.142]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:51.622 --> 00:59:54.523]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:01.625]  Big Brother.
[01:00:02.286 --> 01:00:03.326]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:04.046 --> 01:00:05.247]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:05.807 --> 01:00:06.627]  You want answers?
[01:00:07.387 --> 01:00:08.348]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:08.928 --> 01:00:12.549]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.129 --> 01:00:17.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.594 --> 01:00:26.697]  Alright, Eric Mancow-Muller of Mancow.com and with us for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:28.719]  You're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.200]  I want to draw something here for you.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.401]  We're going to Mancow here in a moment.
[01:00:31.901 --> 01:00:33.982]  Go back to the Federal Reserve takeover of America in 1913.
[01:00:34.183 --> 01:00:37.345]  They still had to federalize everything, get us in debt.
[01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:43.809]  Pyrrhony generally grows very, very, very slowly in history.
[01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.631]  But when it reaches a critical mass,
[01:00:47.612 --> 01:00:51.475]  It starts going straight up, and that's basically what's happening.
[01:00:51.836 --> 01:01:01.243]  Fresh on the heels of passing in the Senate, indefinite detention, no judge, no jury, by the military, the in-deposit commentatus operating in the streets of America.
[01:01:01.563 --> 01:01:05.487]  They've already been gearing up for this for a long time, but this is ahead of the controlled financial collapse.
[01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:10.871]  They now are coming out and saying, we'll just torture citizens, anybody we want, we'll rip your teeth out, everything.
[01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.933]  We're just going to make it legal for the government to torture the living daylights out of you.
[01:01:14.194 --> 01:01:15.595]  So see, we're going off the cliff.
[01:01:15.615 --> 01:01:16.616]  We've now jumped off
[01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:21.239]  And all the craziness we've seen is just the starting gun.
[01:01:21.999 --> 01:01:23.800]  That was that split second of pew!
[01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.222]  Now the orgy is going to start.
[01:01:27.302 --> 01:01:28.763]  And it's a psycho-orgy.
[01:01:29.244 --> 01:01:30.965]  Mankal, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:01:30.985 --> 01:01:33.566]  What do you think of all the craziness that's happening?
[01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:36.989]  Well, I didn't hear everything you just said, but are we talking about orgies?
[01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:40.491]  We're talking about an orgy of corruption, yes.
[01:01:43.143 --> 01:01:44.244]  What is wrong with you?
[01:01:44.344 --> 01:01:48.248]  Everybody I meet from Austin, Texas, all the guys, you know, none of them work.
[01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:49.810]  They all have bushy sideburns.
[01:01:50.351 --> 01:01:53.494]  They're into ironic music, music that's too hip for human ears.
[01:01:53.514 --> 01:01:55.697]  They listen to dog whistles and say it's great.
[01:01:56.418 --> 01:01:59.101]  And yet here you are in Austin, Texas.
[01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.183]  Are you an oddball when you walk around Austin?
[01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:07.475]  No, that's the media creating a false paradigm that it's a bunch of commies running around with limp wrists.
[01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:08.755]  That's very small sectors.
[01:02:09.195 --> 01:02:11.576]  For at least 20 years, there's no real voting in Austin.
[01:02:12.036 --> 01:02:15.597]  Austin's very libertarian, very conservative, but we don't have voting here.
[01:02:15.657 --> 01:02:20.899]  I even had the state admit that in a certified deal at the county commissioners years ago.
[01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:24.280]  Well, do you love how this gerrymandering works?
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:29.680]  So much so that now they've redrawn the lines and a guy like Barney Frank can't get in.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:35.582]  Barney Frank, who's responsible for much of the housing bubble crisis, and his friend Newt Gingrich helped.
[01:02:35.662 --> 01:02:39.482]  I mean, no matter how we vote, it seems, left or right, we get more of them.
[01:02:39.982 --> 01:02:43.343]  And by them, I'm talking about, you know, our friends in the government.
[01:02:43.423 --> 01:02:45.023]  It's crazy.
[01:02:45.043 --> 01:02:48.564]  And of course, you were talking earlier about, you know, the endless detentions they want.
[01:02:49.504 --> 01:02:52.647]  Uh, I wanted to prove that waterboarding was not torture.
[01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:53.608]  I did it.
[01:02:54.288 --> 01:03:00.674]  The videos all over the internet, Bush and Colin Powell and Nancy Pelosi, everybody, uh, Cheney, everybody talked about it.
[01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:07.379]  You know, Hillary Clinton, it doesn't matter left or right, they all need this not to be torture because they all signed off on it.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.865]  And, uh, look, there is an Islamic threat, you and I agree on this, but I wonder how much of it they let happen.
[01:03:15.595 --> 01:03:21.742]  The basic thing Alex, sorry to ramble on here, but it always goes back to the basic thing, which is, what am I going to say?
[01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.910]  Well, you talk about problem, reaction, solution.
[01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:30.332]  I mean, now more than ever, they've given Al-Qaeda publicly Libya.
[01:03:30.352 --> 01:03:31.993]  They're now sending them into Syria.
[01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:34.675]  The underwear bomber was put on the plane by the U.S.
[01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:35.035]  government.
[01:03:35.236 --> 01:03:36.596]  This is all admitted, Mankow!
[01:03:36.877 --> 01:03:40.919]  Yeah, and I think about all these reports I've seen.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:45.583]  NBC, it's just, you and I both have a real hatred for the chinless Chuckie Todd.
[01:03:45.643 --> 01:03:46.704]  I can't stand that guy.
[01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:49.485]  But here you have NBC owned by General Electric.
[01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.726]  They pay no taxes.
[01:03:51.347 --> 01:03:52.808]  Obama puts the head of GE
[01:03:53.468 --> 01:03:53.809]  I don't
[01:04:21.328 --> 01:04:32.972]  Look what guns do when they purposefully do not enforce the gun laws we already have.
[01:04:33.372 --> 01:04:35.553]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:04:36.033 --> 01:04:37.294]  They create the problem.
[01:04:37.714 --> 01:04:38.994]  We react with fear.
[01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:42.455]  And their solution is always you and me and everybody listening.
[01:04:42.756 --> 01:04:46.437]  We lose our freedom or we lose a little more do-re-mi from our pockets.
[01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:48.725]  Manco.com's the website.
[01:04:48.945 --> 01:04:54.709]  Big segment straight ahead, we'll get into Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, we'll get into internet censorship and a lot more.
[01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.031]  Hey everybody, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:58.551 --> 01:05:01.093]  If you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift, listen up.
[01:05:01.293 --> 01:05:03.555]  This will make your holiday shopping very easy.
[01:05:04.235 --> 01:05:09.919]  This year, give a seed bank from one of our oldest sponsors, Solutions from Science, to your friends and family.
[01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:10.839]  Here's why.
[01:05:10.979 --> 01:05:13.521]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one
[01:05:13.601 --> 01:05:18.706]  The ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:22.649]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open-pollinated seeds.
[01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:28.655]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if we face a real meltdown.
[01:05:29.115 --> 01:05:30.036]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:30.616 --> 01:05:37.502]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.
[01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:42.208]  Give a Survival Seed Bank this Christmas by going to survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:42.448 --> 01:05:44.170]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:48.616]  Or you can call 877-327-0365 to give the gift that produces an ongoing supply of life-sustaining food.
[01:05:57.082 --> 01:05:58.564]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:58.784 --> 01:06:03.811]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:05.453]  Saving means to make money.
[01:06:05.634 --> 01:06:14.425]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:06:15.146 --> 01:06:22.249]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:06:22.669 --> 01:06:30.292]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:06:30.692 --> 01:06:35.594]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:06:35.914 --> 01:06:38.075]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:06:40.856 --> 01:06:43.760]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[01:06:46.444 --> 01:06:48.567]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:06:56.917 --> 01:07:00.521]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:03.944]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:04.204 --> 01:07:08.989]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:15.215]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.618]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:18.158 --> 01:07:18.438]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:18.879]  Bernanke?
[01:07:18.959 --> 01:07:19.739]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:19.779 --> 01:07:20.680]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.162]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:37.051 --> 01:07:38.893]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:39.193 --> 01:07:43.997]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:44.337 --> 01:07:54.266]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:57.368 --> 01:08:02.933]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.358 --> 01:08:10.461]  Mankow Muller of Mankow.com joins us.
[01:08:11.002 --> 01:08:21.212]  I wanted to get his take on the Republican field, on what's happening in the global economy, on problem reaction solution, on the feds now ordering delisting of websites on Google.
[01:08:21.252 --> 01:08:22.393]  No judge, no jury.
[01:08:22.854 --> 01:08:23.875]  It's getting crazy.
[01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:25.797]  The internet kill switch a la carte.
[01:08:26.497 --> 01:08:29.039]  But first, Mancow, Fast and Furious.
[01:08:29.099 --> 01:08:37.947]  We learned that the government shipped the guns directly into Mexico and into Indiana, Illinois, Florida to drug gangs they like to knock out other drug gangs.
[01:08:37.987 --> 01:08:39.168]  They ship drugs in.
[01:08:40.169 --> 01:08:42.371]  It's been confirmed that they lied to Congress.
[01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:45.573]  And now it's just gone off the radar screen.
[01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.095]  There's a great example
[01:08:47.575 --> 01:08:51.057]  A problem reaction solution or a false flag terror attack.
[01:08:51.417 --> 01:09:03.462]  If shipping tens of thousands of guns in that killed thousands of Mexicans, hundreds of Americans, and at least three police officers and border patrol, if that's not a false flag terror attack, I mean, if they'll do that, why wouldn't they do Oklahoma City?
[01:09:03.522 --> 01:09:09.064]  This same Attorney General was the Deputy Attorney General with his hands deep in Oklahoma City 16, 17 years ago.
[01:09:09.084 --> 01:09:09.604]  Alex, I'm going to go.
[01:09:14.534 --> 01:09:15.696]  I don't care whether anyone watches it or not.
[01:09:31.699 --> 01:09:41.363]  He did studies on marijuana, and basically, whether you're pro-weed or not, why we have this war on, you know, this war on everything, the drug wars cost us a lot of money.
[01:09:41.403 --> 01:09:50.167]  I mean, I had a kid, a 17-year-old kid in front of my house, he got pulled over, they found a seed, the government took his car, he said, hey man, it's a used car!
[01:09:50.667 --> 01:09:55.369]  They found a seed, a single marijuana seed, and they sold his car.
[01:09:56.349 --> 01:10:05.517]  Our government loves finding some kid with a little bit of weed, half a joint, a roach, something, so they can take your property and sell it and then get the money.
[01:10:06.137 --> 01:10:07.398]  Okay, this is all, this is all.
[01:10:07.819 --> 01:10:09.640]  Okay, so they went and did the study.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.684]  They wanted to prove, this doctor that I spoke with, wanted to prove the evils of marijuana.
[01:10:14.724 --> 01:10:16.626]  He was anti-marijuana.
[01:10:17.487 --> 01:10:18.608]  And, uh, he couldn't do it.
[01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:33.683]  Now, every time they try to do an anti-gun study, if they're intellectually honest, they cannot prove that more guns equals more crime or anything.
[01:10:33.783 --> 01:10:40.812]  Well, that Illinois professor got caught lying to give the only anti-gun study ever and it turned out it was fake and he lost his tenure.
[01:10:42.911 --> 01:10:45.333]  More guns equal less crime.
[01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:46.715]  Did you hear that, folks?
[01:10:46.735 --> 01:10:48.456]  That's different than everything you've ever heard.
[01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.498]  More guns equals less crime.
[01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:50.779]  Why?
[01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:52.260]  Look, I'm in the city of Chicago.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.541]  You ought to see these guys.
[01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:55.023]  I go to work at 2.30 in the morning.
[01:10:55.283 --> 01:10:57.145]  Their asses hanging out the back of their pants.
[01:10:57.365 --> 01:10:58.526]  They're looking for victims.
[01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:04.793]  If they think you can shoot back, they're not going to burglarize you, rape you, or kill you.
[01:11:05.706 --> 01:11:06.767]  We need guns!
[01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:09.108]  Look at the most liberal states with the most gun laws!
[01:11:09.148 --> 01:11:16.732]  But if you're that old man in Chicago, I see all these videos where they beat up old people, blood everywhere, and the cops do nothing about it.
[01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:29.538]  Well, apparently when white people are beaten up in Chicago, because they're white, and I think every crime is a hate crime, you know, every crime is a hate crime, but if you're whitey in Chicago, that isn't a hate crime.
[01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:34.421]  Anyway, the point I'm making is, Alex, you and I disagree.
[01:11:35.385 --> 01:11:38.547]  I believe Fast and Furious was so good.
[01:11:38.887 --> 01:11:40.828]  Look, what do we cling to in America?
[01:11:41.389 --> 01:11:42.309]  What is Obama?
[01:11:42.409 --> 01:11:44.410]  Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:44.831 --> 01:11:45.551]  And Eric Holder.
[01:11:45.611 --> 01:11:47.532]  They hate cod, guns, and guts.
[01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:48.993]  Right?
[01:11:49.153 --> 01:11:50.714]  They hate cod, guns, and guts.
[01:12:02.731 --> 01:12:03.952]  We're good to go.
[01:12:17.836 --> 01:12:18.697]  No, I don't.
[01:12:19.598 --> 01:12:24.562]  I think New York with the highest crime rate next to Chicago with a total gun ban for citizens is reasonable.
[01:12:25.102 --> 01:12:31.648]  And I think, you know, it's no mistake that cities run by mafias want the public disarmed.
[01:12:31.668 --> 01:12:35.251]  I think North Korea is a great place where they ban guns.
[01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:40.096]  No, no, I'm being serious.
[01:12:40.136 --> 01:12:41.478]  You're like, don't you get it, Alex.
[01:12:41.518 --> 01:12:43.300]  So I thought I'd be sarcastic back.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.042]  Let's shift gears into Newt Gingrich.
[01:12:45.082 --> 01:12:50.208]  Newt Gingrich supported NAFTA, GATT, the banker bailout, carbon taxes.
[01:12:50.288 --> 01:12:56.015]  He wrote creepy forwards to Toffler's book where he calls for global government into the family.
[01:12:56.796 --> 01:13:06.041]  Uh, you've got Mitt Romney, just as creepy, pro-abortion, anti-gun, amnesty city, wrote Obamacare, and I, and I forget some, I mean, there's so much.
[01:13:06.642 --> 01:13:08.723]  Uh, and then now these two are dueling with each other.
[01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:10.384]  In fact, we got a document cam shot in here.
[01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:11.745]  Here's Gallup poll.
[01:13:12.045 --> 01:13:17.088]  Genrich leads Romney at a new low, at a new low and positive.
[01:13:17.988 --> 01:13:23.050]  I'm conservative, but I support everything Al Gore does.
[01:13:39.309 --> 01:13:43.030]  Then you have Huntsman who worked for Obama.
[01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.730]  I mean, come on.
[01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:45.890]  These guys are plants.
[01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.011]  Look, Newt Gingrich, I like Newt, okay?
[01:13:49.331 --> 01:13:50.151]  Newt's a friend of mine.
[01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:56.472]  He's a smart guy, but certainly what you're talking about, I'm not being safe here, but it is very troubling.
[01:13:57.193 --> 01:14:00.333]  Mitt Romney, boy, he's all over the place.
[01:14:00.613 --> 01:14:02.434]  Look, I've had dinner with Mitt several times.
[01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:06.514]  He's a nice enough guy, but you know, he's the guy that has tassels on his shoes.
[01:14:06.955 --> 01:14:08.915]  Any man that's ever worked for a living,
[01:14:09.775 --> 01:14:14.960]  Any man that has ever worked for a living knows Mitt Romney.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.521]  Let me tell you who he is, okay?
[01:14:16.981 --> 01:14:20.404]  He's the guy that wears the Disney tie and thinks he's wacky.
[01:14:20.785 --> 01:14:24.268]  He's the guy that forces everybody to go bowling so that they can bond.
[01:14:25.008 --> 01:14:28.111]  He has tassels on his shoes that make him wacky.
[01:14:29.072 --> 01:14:30.733]  He points his finger at you.
[01:14:30.773 --> 01:14:31.634]  He winks at you.
[01:14:31.714 --> 01:14:34.296]  He's cool, but really he's just a stroke.
[01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:34.957]  He's just another
[01:14:37.251 --> 01:14:38.052]  That's it!
[01:14:38.233 --> 01:14:42.138]  He wants to be liked, he wants to be cool, and he just isn't.
[01:14:42.698 --> 01:14:47.385]  And it seems to me he will say or do anything to get into the White House.
[01:14:47.425 --> 01:14:48.045]  It makes me nervous.
[01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:52.692]  Now listen, I've been in top networks, I've been in newspapers, and I've been in the top...
[01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:56.818]  Conservative radio show studios.
[01:14:57.098 --> 01:15:00.864]  Alex, I've told you about this and I'm talking to the most powerful people in media.
[01:15:01.044 --> 01:15:06.291]  And it happened to be by chance on several occasions where Ron Paul wins their straw polls.
[01:15:06.772 --> 01:15:08.154]  They do a national...
[01:15:09.015 --> 01:15:09.716]  A phone poll.
[01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:11.777]  Ron Paul wins and they immediately throw it out.
[01:15:11.797 --> 01:15:13.618]  They have a Ron Paul voters call lot.
[01:15:13.818 --> 01:15:14.418]  They're kooky.
[01:15:14.438 --> 01:15:17.119]  So, they always eliminate Ron Paul.
[01:15:17.259 --> 01:15:19.400]  I think Ron Paul has a much bigger following.
[01:15:19.861 --> 01:15:21.622]  Why do they keep giving us Mitt Romney?
[01:15:21.862 --> 01:15:23.483]  The media wants Mitt Romney.
[01:15:23.843 --> 01:15:25.223]  That makes me nervous.
[01:15:25.684 --> 01:15:28.445]  Because no matter how we vote, we get more Obama.
[01:15:28.465 --> 01:15:29.526]  We get more big government.
[01:15:29.546 --> 01:15:30.386]  We get McCain.
[01:15:30.706 --> 01:15:31.687]  We get Bob Dole.
[01:15:31.747 --> 01:15:34.468]  We get, we get more, more, more, more of them in our life.
[01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.572]  More taxes!
[01:15:36.612 --> 01:15:37.600]  More intrusions!
[01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:40.748]  I agree with you.
[01:15:40.788 --> 01:15:44.009]  Now listen, a lot of people say, this can't happen here.
[01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:58.632]  But now they're coming out saying, let's censor the internet, let's censor people we want, let's censor talk radio, let's have the government order Google to delist sites, let's have TSA on the streets, and now they've passed the bill, now they've got to implement it.
[01:15:59.352 --> 01:16:05.713]  And of course they'll pick examples of really bad sounding people, so it sounds reasonable to secretly arrest citizens.
[01:16:06.174 --> 01:16:07.474]  Lindsey Graham has admitted it.
[01:16:08.927 --> 01:16:10.688]  Uh, I've got Clemson McCain admitting it.
[01:16:10.728 --> 01:16:11.329]  It's in the bill.
[01:16:12.029 --> 01:16:12.829]  They got it passed.
[01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:17.072]  Now, Obama says he's going to veto it, but the point is he's already still carrying out things like this.
[01:16:17.892 --> 01:16:22.735]  Now, expanding on this, now they're saying they're going to go ahead and start torturing Americans.
[01:16:23.155 --> 01:16:27.898]  Regardless, I mean, again, this stuff is so scary.
[01:16:29.059 --> 01:16:31.740]  Why do you think all this is moving so quick right now, Mancow?
[01:16:32.441 --> 01:16:35.843]  Uh, look, fear is the four-letter F word that controls the masses.
[01:16:36.483 --> 01:16:37.404]  It's your wife.
[01:16:38.174 --> 01:16:38.694]  Your wife!
[01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.837]  You divorce me, I'll take everything, and you won't see your kids!
[01:16:42.257 --> 01:16:43.258]  It's the school teacher!
[01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.439]  Do as I say, or you won't get a job!
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.640]  It's your parents!
[01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:49.843]  Sit down, shut up, or I'm gonna spank you!
[01:16:49.863 --> 01:16:52.565]  They use fear against us!
[01:16:52.925 --> 01:16:53.786]  Look at the movies!
[01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:54.927]  Look at the video games!
[01:16:55.287 --> 01:16:57.408]  Our society is based on fear!
[01:16:57.789 --> 01:16:59.430]  Look at the Islamic boogeymen!
[01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.771]  Why are we still
[01:17:06.269 --> 01:17:14.333]  You see them waltz through the line, and yet my wife, Alex, who you know is very hot, they always have to do the two-finger swipe on her.
[01:17:14.553 --> 01:17:17.674]  They have to take pictures of our children naked with these machines.
[01:17:18.115 --> 01:17:20.116]  I mean, it is such a setup.
[01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.517]  It is such... Look, we're living in a land of Oz.
[01:17:22.877 --> 01:17:25.138]  You and I, Alex, have seen behind the curtain.
[01:17:25.598 --> 01:17:27.759]  We know the truth.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.500]  We are... You know, I used to laugh at you.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.021]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:31.061 --> 01:17:33.702]  Prison... Oh, my God.
[01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:34.723]  You're a prophet.
[01:17:36.178 --> 01:17:41.083]  Well, I was just going to the urban warfare drills and studying government documents, and that's the good news though, man.
[01:17:41.103 --> 01:17:43.765]  Cal, you've talked about this, I've talked about it, Ron Paul's talked about it.
[01:17:44.205 --> 01:17:53.474]  I think that's our real ace in the hole, is that we warn people that stuff's now happening, and something's got to give.
[01:17:53.534 --> 01:18:00.060]  How can MF Global and Corzine, Obama's chief financial advisor, economic advisor, take $3 billion
[01:18:01.755 --> 01:18:01.915]  Go ahead.
[01:18:01.935 --> 01:18:02.456]  You're thieves.
[01:18:02.696 --> 01:18:03.116]  You're thieves.
[01:18:03.176 --> 01:18:03.737]  Listen, brother.
[01:18:04.037 --> 01:18:04.878]  Let me tell you something.
[01:18:06.199 --> 01:18:07.820]  Look, I live in Chicago, okay?
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.061]  It is the mob.
[01:18:09.742 --> 01:18:10.683]  It is the mob.
[01:18:10.783 --> 01:18:13.465]  Forget all the Kingsmen and all of that.
[01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:14.546]  Louisiana.
[01:18:14.926 --> 01:18:15.907]  Come to Chicago.
[01:18:16.367 --> 01:18:22.252]  And you think this guy got through this cesspool that he walked across the cesspool like Jesus?
[01:18:22.633 --> 01:18:24.054]  Obama is dirty.
[01:18:24.554 --> 01:18:25.575]  His friends are getting rich.
[01:18:25.595 --> 01:18:27.036]  He'll say whatever he has to say.
[01:18:27.056 --> 01:18:30.439]  He has turned America into a criminal enterprise.
[01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:31.680]  I give you Solyndra.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:32.821]  I give you Holder.
[01:18:33.081 --> 01:18:33.922]  I give you this guy.
[01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:34.822]  I give you that guy.
[01:18:35.183 --> 01:18:36.244]  I mean, they're stealing.
[01:18:36.264 --> 01:18:40.847]  Hey, and if you support Obama on his agenda, you don't have to pay taxes.
[01:18:40.887 --> 01:18:44.070]  You support Obama, your car dealership gets to stay in business.
[01:18:45.356 --> 01:18:53.019]  No, that's the point, is that it's like the bottom finally fell out, and now they're just going for broke in front of everybody.
[01:18:53.539 --> 01:18:56.140]  And I'm asking myself, man, Cal, what's next?
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.140]  Who's reporting it?
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.522]  Chuckie Todd, the chitiless wonder on, on, uh, that, I mean, what is NBC now?
[01:19:02.582 --> 01:19:03.662]  What is their news?
[01:19:04.122 --> 01:19:07.083]  It's just, I can't, you have to see it, Alex, to believe it.
[01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.124]  It's, it's such propaganda.
[01:19:09.864 --> 01:19:11.705]  I mean, look, the people around Hitler,
[01:19:12.449 --> 01:19:18.235]  The people around Hitler admitted they could have never had, it could have never happened with a newspaper.
[01:19:18.475 --> 01:19:19.596]  They had to have radio.
[01:19:19.876 --> 01:19:21.778]  They had to be able to get into the minds of the people.
[01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:25.882]  Look at how this president is manipulating the lemmings.
[01:19:26.703 --> 01:19:28.065]  I mean, look at the economy.
[01:19:28.125 --> 01:19:30.247]  How many people do you know that are hurting?
[01:19:30.868 --> 01:19:31.889]  Our people are hurting!
[01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:33.171]  America is hurting!
[01:19:33.612 --> 01:19:34.453]  And watch the news!
[01:19:34.553 --> 01:19:35.335]  Everything's great!
[01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:37.838]  Another great idea from Chairman Obama!
[01:19:38.179 --> 01:19:39.761]  Isn't Michelle Obama beautiful?
[01:19:39.962 --> 01:19:43.046]  Michelle Obama's the most beautiful First Lady we've ever had!
[01:19:48.715 --> 01:19:49.355]  Unbelievable.
[01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:50.436]  Mancow.com.
[01:19:50.476 --> 01:19:51.437]  He's on in the mornings.
[01:19:51.757 --> 01:19:52.497]  Thank you, Mancow.
[01:19:52.517 --> 01:19:53.198]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:19:53.218 --> 01:19:54.218]  Let me say bye to you during the break.
[01:19:54.238 --> 01:19:55.819]  We've got another guest coming up.
[01:19:55.859 --> 01:19:56.580]  Lennon LaRouche.
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.162]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.703]  Big Berkey water filters.
[01:20:02.023 --> 01:20:03.624]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[01:20:03.964 --> 01:20:08.166]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:20:08.647 --> 01:20:12.249]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:20:12.529 --> 01:20:16.032]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:20:16.292 --> 01:20:21.616]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:20:21.876 --> 01:20:25.599]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:20:25.919 --> 01:20:30.963]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:20:31.343 --> 01:20:37.706]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:20:48.671 --> 01:20:52.212]  That's 877-99-BER-K-E-Y.
[01:20:52.613 --> 01:20:53.793]  Gift well this Christmas.
[01:20:54.013 --> 01:20:55.454]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[01:20:58.697 --> 01:21:02.840]  Burglars love easy targets, like a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.241]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:21:05.441 --> 01:21:08.924]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[01:21:09.324 --> 01:21:16.208]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:21:16.469 --> 01:21:20.651]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:21:20.892 --> 01:21:27.596]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[01:21:27.896 --> 01:21:29.437]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[01:21:29.637 --> 01:21:35.461]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:26.534]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:26.714 --> 01:22:31.097]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:31.277 --> 01:22:36.981]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:40.503]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:40.743 --> 01:22:43.625]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.607 --> 01:22:48.368]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:48.508 --> 01:22:48.789]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.809 --> 01:22:50.150]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.695 --> 01:23:03.280]  In the event of an emergency, do you really trust Obama and the federal government to provide for you and your family?
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:12.447]  Modern-day emergencies like floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, snowstorms, terrorist attacks, or anything else can strike anywhere, leaving your family vulnerable.
[01:23:12.607 --> 01:23:15.690]  That's why you can't afford to be without emergency food supplies.
[01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:20.171]  If you're like most people, you know that you need emergency food supplies, but you keep putting it off.
[01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:27.553]  So, to help you, Ready Reserve Foods is offering a free sample kit of emergency food so you can test our food for yourself.
[01:23:27.693 --> 01:23:29.494]  The food really is free.
[01:23:29.694 --> 01:23:32.615]  You simply pay for the shipping and we'll send you the food for free.
[01:23:32.815 --> 01:23:35.836]  To get your free sample kit of emergency food, simply call 800.
[01:23:36.536 --> 01:23:37.117]  We're good to go.
[01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:10.270]  Okay, for the next hour, we're joined by Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:11.571]  I appreciate him joining us.
[01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:13.332]  I actually double-booked Man Cow on.
[01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:16.294]  That's why Mr. LaRouche is on 20 minutes later than he would have been.
[01:24:16.314 --> 01:24:18.156]  larouchepac.com.
[01:24:18.616 --> 01:24:25.461]  He's an American-born activist and founder of a network of political committees, parties, and publications known collectively as the LaRouche Movement.
[01:24:26.201 --> 01:24:31.924]  And he was a perennial presidential candidate from 76 to 2004, running once for his own U.S.
[01:24:31.944 --> 01:24:34.545]  Labor Party and campaigning seven times for the Democratic Party.
[01:24:35.225 --> 01:24:39.147]  Larouchepac.com, he's been called a right-winger by the left, a left-winger by the right.
[01:24:39.927 --> 01:24:46.150]  His work, of course, has been called by former heads of the National Security Council and others as, quote, the best private intelligence network out there.
[01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:49.932]  I don't say I agree with all of their solutions, perhaps because I don't
[01:24:50.532 --> 01:24:51.213]  Grasp it all.
[01:24:51.533 --> 01:24:53.754]  But I know their historical analysis is spot on.
[01:24:53.794 --> 01:24:54.775]  This is a short segment.
[01:24:55.135 --> 01:24:56.116]  Long segment's coming up.
[01:24:56.136 --> 01:24:57.297]  He's going to be breaking it all down.
[01:24:57.337 --> 01:25:02.161]  But I've got to say, the things LaRouche talked about over a decade ago are now happening.
[01:25:02.461 --> 01:25:09.506]  The global meltdown, the derivatives crisis, what's happening with the euro, the total collapse, the super committee.
[01:25:09.626 --> 01:25:13.069]  And now they've passed the bill to allow the secret
[01:25:13.889 --> 01:25:18.737]  Total arrest of American citizens disappearing for life for no reason in the dungeons.
[01:25:19.018 --> 01:25:21.021]  They're now trying to pass a bill for total torture.
[01:25:21.342 --> 01:25:22.684]  This is mainstream news.
[01:25:23.635 --> 01:25:26.856]  And again, it's one thing to pass and another thing to implement it.
[01:25:27.236 --> 01:25:31.237]  It just shows the brazen criminality now of Congress.
[01:25:31.678 --> 01:25:35.979]  And that they know everything's going to collapse, and the crooks don't want to get in trouble for their crimes.
[01:25:36.439 --> 01:25:38.100]  They want to ride this tiger.
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:39.640]  The question is, can they?
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.721]  So, he's accurately predicted what would happen.
[01:25:42.081 --> 01:25:43.121]  What's coming next?
[01:25:43.241 --> 01:25:44.341]  Where are we currently?
[01:25:44.622 --> 01:25:47.242]  What's up next with Lyndon LaRouche?
[01:25:47.783 --> 01:25:49.003]  Sir, thank you for joining us today.
[01:25:51.584 --> 01:25:52.105]  How do you do?
[01:25:52.686 --> 01:25:59.038]  I'm okay here in Grave Times, but where, again, you've accurately predicted, where are we currently, where are we going?
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.304]  We're right on the edge of thermonuclear war.
[01:26:03.566 --> 01:26:06.267]  As to whether that will happen or not, that's another question.
[01:26:07.027 --> 01:26:10.348]  But the likelihood that it could happen is great.
[01:26:10.969 --> 01:26:12.269]  What's happened is the U.S.
[01:26:12.369 --> 01:26:22.613]  forces in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Persian Gulf regions, especially naval forces in particular, are positioned for launching a thermonuclear war.
[01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:29.077]  The name of the game, of course, is what we're going to do to Syria, what we're going to do to Iran.
[01:26:29.538 --> 01:26:32.280]  But if you look at the forces in the area, that makes no sense.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:44.769]  Then you look at other aspects of it, and you know that Russia's in on the thing, in defending Syria in particular, against this atrocity.
[01:26:45.646 --> 01:26:49.208]  And you realize that we're on the edge of actually going to throw a milky way.
[01:26:49.228 --> 01:27:04.859]  What happened was, of course, and I don't know how well this is known, but our leading general officers, our advisors and so forth, who advise us on our security, have opposed any action by Obama of this type.
[01:27:05.842 --> 01:27:08.944]  That is, therefore, that is in that degree tied up.
[01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:15.088]  But, what's hanging out there is at any moment a war could start.
[01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:18.631]  Now, this war will be a war with thermonuclear weapons.
[01:27:20.692 --> 01:27:21.513]  That's the fact.
[01:27:22.073 --> 01:27:26.937]  The idea that this is only Syria and Iran is nonsense.
[01:27:27.997 --> 01:27:31.700]  This thing, what we have positioned in the
[01:27:33.215 --> 01:27:35.777]  Gulf area and in the Eastern Mediterranean.
[01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:39.320]  What we have positioned is a capability for thermonuclear war and nothing else.
[01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:48.048]  Our allies, including the British, do not have the depth of weapon capability for doing something like this.
[01:27:48.588 --> 01:27:56.175]  Only the United States and only the thermonuclear warfare capability of the United States could actually conduct such a war.
[01:27:56.935 --> 01:28:00.899]  It would be a war against the entirety of Asia and other places.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.421]  It's now being halted.
[01:28:04.201 --> 01:28:06.662]  The British are pushing this greatly.
[01:28:07.843 --> 01:28:08.963]  And we're on the edge of it.
[01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:10.504]  Alright, you have amazing sources.
[01:28:10.544 --> 01:28:11.325]  We're going to break in a moment.
[01:28:11.365 --> 01:28:12.585]  I want to come back and go over this.
[01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:15.427]  But for those that don't know, it's not even getting much attention here.
[01:28:15.467 --> 01:28:16.667]  It's all over the foreign press.
[01:28:17.267 --> 01:28:21.530]  Russia, Medvedev yesterday told Poland and others, go ahead and move your missiles in.
[01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:23.450]  We're going to blow them up.
[01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:24.251]  We're going to destroy them.
[01:28:24.731 --> 01:28:26.332]  And Russia normally doesn't just make threats.
[01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:27.552]  Just like 888 in 2008 when the West attacked
[01:28:30.954 --> 01:28:35.217]  South Ossetia and other areas and the Russians rolled in mobile nukes.
[01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:40.721]  The Russians have said we're going to block your supply routes and the Russian controlled route into Afghanistan.
[01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.563]  The Pakistanis are blocking that route.
[01:28:42.823 --> 01:28:44.564]  Russian ships have shown up in Syria.
[01:28:45.565 --> 01:28:47.046]  And they moved two months ago U.S.
[01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:49.468]  troops out of Iraq into Kuwait.
[01:28:49.788 --> 01:28:51.249]  And I've talked to people who are involved.
[01:28:51.269 --> 01:28:53.251]  They're telling them get ready for a giant war.
[01:28:53.711 --> 01:28:54.312]  So you're right.
[01:28:54.332 --> 01:28:57.394]  I mean, obviously, you have a lot of sources, but this is incredible.
[01:28:58.817 --> 01:29:01.518]  Well, this is what we're working against right now.
[01:29:03.158 --> 01:29:05.839]  The Russian operation is not actually an aggressive operation.
[01:29:06.359 --> 01:29:07.879]  But what happened was the following.
[01:29:08.839 --> 01:29:14.441]  Remember the war in Libya?
[01:29:14.921 --> 01:29:16.421]  Now, that was rushed through.
[01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:20.622]  And the intention was, and the signals were definitely from Britain,
[01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:25.691]  Was to go immediately to the war against both...
[01:29:45.595 --> 01:29:48.584]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:49.547 --> 01:29:52.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.246 --> 01:29:57.467]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:30:56.104 --> 01:30:57.225]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:57.265 --> 01:31:03.968]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.510]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:11.933]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:14.915]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:15.175 --> 01:31:17.277]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:17.497 --> 01:31:23.422]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:23.762 --> 01:31:26.944]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:27.124 --> 01:31:32.648]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:32.909 --> 01:31:34.210]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:35.751]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:35.851 --> 01:31:38.413]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:38.533 --> 01:31:39.954]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.575]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:42.735 --> 01:31:47.238]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:47.358 --> 01:31:49.819]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.342]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:58.562 --> 01:32:03.587]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:32:03.868 --> 01:32:05.229]  Saving means to make money.
[01:32:05.409 --> 01:32:14.199]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:32:14.919 --> 01:32:22.024]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:32:22.464 --> 01:32:30.069]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:32:30.469 --> 01:32:35.392]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:32:35.692 --> 01:32:37.853]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:32:46.222 --> 01:32:48.345]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:33:06.915 --> 01:33:07.498]  I don't know.
[01:33:37.017 --> 01:33:46.123]  Ladies and gentlemen, we told you the Euro was going to start breaking up in a controlled implosion into a new mega-bank of the world run by Goldman Sachs.
[01:33:46.443 --> 01:33:51.886]  Now the news, from Time Magazine to Financial Times of London calls it, Goldman Sachs conquers the world.
[01:33:52.607 --> 01:33:53.407]  And they're praising it.
[01:33:53.447 --> 01:33:55.629]  The genius of selling the country's derivatives.
[01:33:55.929 --> 01:34:00.492]  The genius of getting their personnel into every power position of regulatory control.
[01:34:01.172 --> 01:34:04.254]  And executive control and legislative control of the bureaucracy.
[01:34:04.794 --> 01:34:06.595]  Europe is waiving all of its rights.
[01:34:07.035 --> 01:34:08.736]  The end of self-determination.
[01:34:09.136 --> 01:34:17.740]  And I hear CNBC, MSNBC, Bloomberg, their experts are praising this month's economist, is praising the technocracy.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:19.661]  The bankers are going to run everything now.
[01:34:20.081 --> 01:34:21.062]  They know how to do it.
[01:34:21.542 --> 01:34:25.584]  I mean, everything, Lennon LaRouche, Ron Paul, people from all over the political spectrum,
[01:34:26.977 --> 01:34:27.838]  have pointed out.
[01:34:28.558 --> 01:34:32.362]  You notice anybody who's actually right about core issues is like off the reservation.
[01:34:32.582 --> 01:34:39.628]  The whole left-right thing is this tiny, sequestered, just totally limited false information.
[01:34:40.376 --> 01:34:41.297]  And Lyndon LaRouche joins us.
[01:34:41.357 --> 01:34:44.939]  I'm going to try to give you the floor, sir, to go over the whole geopolitical breakdown.
[01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:52.244]  You were getting into what's happening in Libya, where all of this is going, and the level of the precipice that we're on right now.
[01:34:52.264 --> 01:34:57.968]  I had the former head of Pakistani intelligence, Hamid Gulen, and he said, yes, this could lead to a larger nuclear war.
[01:34:58.588 --> 01:35:03.552]  The Russians, as you said, are getting in defensive battle formation, saying, do not attack Syria.
[01:35:04.292 --> 01:35:05.353]  Things are getting wild.
[01:35:05.413 --> 01:35:06.594]  Lyndon LaRouche, please continue.
[01:35:08.018 --> 01:35:10.519]  Well, we've got to understand the general situation.
[01:35:10.559 --> 01:35:15.861]  First of all, we have a general breakdown of the entire international financial system.
[01:35:16.522 --> 01:35:18.783]  It's worse in the transatlantic region.
[01:35:19.663 --> 01:35:21.944]  It's less bad in the Asian region.
[01:35:23.004 --> 01:35:27.486]  Now, we talk about these bankers.
[01:35:28.066 --> 01:35:28.847]  They're bankrupt.
[01:35:29.407 --> 01:35:33.849]  We're in now in the worst hyperinflation in world history, right now.
[01:35:34.935 --> 01:35:37.437]  These bankers don't have anything.
[01:35:37.817 --> 01:35:43.221]  If you tried to redeem any of the claims they think they have, they have less than nothing.
[01:35:44.002 --> 01:35:45.703]  This is empty blank paper.
[01:35:46.524 --> 01:35:48.005]  Passed it for hyperinflation.
[01:35:48.505 --> 01:35:55.010]  This is being highly managed politically by doing all kinds of things to Europe and doing things to the United States.
[01:35:55.591 --> 01:35:57.712]  But this thing is not going to survive.
[01:35:58.413 --> 01:36:02.496]  These banks, every blasted one of them, is doomed.
[01:36:03.382 --> 01:36:07.445]  Now, there is a solution for this, and it's the only solution.
[01:36:07.705 --> 01:36:11.028]  It's Roosevelt's solution, Franklin Roosevelt's solution, Glass-Steagall.
[01:36:11.468 --> 01:36:13.710]  That does not solve the total problem.
[01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:20.775]  That eliminates the worst problem right now and makes it possible to undertake management of the problem.
[01:36:21.914 --> 01:36:27.836]  We would also have to create, since the Federal Reserve System no longer functions, it's hopelessly bankrupt.
[01:36:28.556 --> 01:36:29.857]  It could never be paid up.
[01:36:30.697 --> 01:36:32.138]  This thing will never be paid off.
[01:36:32.558 --> 01:36:33.198]  It's doomed.
[01:36:34.358 --> 01:36:36.719]  So therefore, we're going back to the old test.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:42.881]  Classify this thing as commercial paper that is not backed by anything.
[01:36:42.941 --> 01:36:43.842]  It's speculative paper.
[01:36:44.801 --> 01:36:46.824]  And therefore, just put it out on its own.
[01:36:47.585 --> 01:36:49.207]  And let the people try to collect the money.
[01:36:49.248 --> 01:36:49.969]  There's nothing there.
[01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:55.877]  We have to save a part of our financial system, our commercial banking system.
[01:36:57.055 --> 01:36:58.095]  That's with Glass-Steagall.
[01:36:58.615 --> 01:37:07.377]  But that's not enough money to start a recovery and we need now an actual physical recovery because we have people, our people are going to start dying massively.
[01:37:07.677 --> 01:37:11.878]  You look at the food supply for the United States going into the months ahead.
[01:37:12.398 --> 01:37:14.779]  Think about March and April at the present rate.
[01:37:15.599 --> 01:37:21.120]  We're going to have people dying of hunger and effects correlated to that in the United States.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:24.041]  So therefore we need an immediate reform
[01:37:24.918 --> 01:37:28.020]  We understand, I do, and I guess some other people as well do.
[01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:29.722]  We go through Glass-Steagall.
[01:37:30.502 --> 01:37:34.205]  That will, could save the United States, temporarily.
[01:37:34.225 --> 01:37:38.869]  It will also be a vehicle to save Western Europe, temporarily.
[01:37:39.716 --> 01:37:41.717]  Because if we do this, they'll do it.
[01:37:42.337 --> 01:37:48.961]  But the other thing we have to do is we have to go back, since we don't have a Federal Reserve System anymore, it's bankrupt, it's hopelessly bankrupt.
[01:37:49.601 --> 01:37:54.483]  We therefore have to go back to Hamilton's original policy, which was U.S.
[01:37:54.543 --> 01:37:55.504]  constitutional policy.
[01:37:56.337 --> 01:38:01.059]  We go back to a credit system, not to a banking system, not to a money system.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:08.363]  Under a credit system, the federal government can authorize a federal debt for specific purposes.
[01:38:09.164 --> 01:38:11.165]  Some of these things will be government projects.
[01:38:11.905 --> 01:38:12.925]  Totally government projects.
[01:38:12.965 --> 01:38:15.547]  Like the Tennessee Valley Authority was a project.
[01:38:17.008 --> 01:38:19.930]  Noapa is a project of the same nature, but a much bigger one.
[01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:27.336]  You have transportation systems we need, all kinds of things we need, which the federal government is going to have to finance.
[01:38:27.916 --> 01:38:29.718]  And it has to be financed on good management.
[01:38:30.318 --> 01:38:32.180]  But then there are other things we can do.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.284]  We can also get into long-term agreements with nations of the world.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:47.024]  And we can create a fixed exchange system among nations which agree to the idea of Glass-Steagall, as in their case.
[01:38:47.165 --> 01:38:49.726]  So stop the global concerted devaluation.
[01:38:49.746 --> 01:38:55.829]  But shifting back, sir, the elites, the finance oligarchs and their tropism that you've talked so much about,
[01:38:56.269 --> 01:38:57.390]  They're not going to stop.
[01:38:57.471 --> 01:39:01.856]  They are preparing Dodger Stadium right now as a giant FEMA camp.
[01:39:01.876 --> 01:39:03.958]  Kevin Booth's getting video of it.
[01:39:04.298 --> 01:39:11.086]  Under Homeland Security, they're arresting the occupiers nationwide as a giant simulation of political arrest.
[01:39:11.567 --> 01:39:14.711]  As you know, they passed the bill to secretly arrest
[01:39:15.291 --> 01:39:15.531]  U.S.
[01:39:15.552 --> 01:39:16.052]  citizens
[01:39:32.691 --> 01:39:33.811]  And they're going forward.
[01:39:33.831 --> 01:39:42.154]  I mean, it's just come out that Henry Paulson, we already knew this, gave hedge funds inside information on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae when he was Treasury Secretary.
[01:39:42.174 --> 01:39:43.054]  Well, of course he did.
[01:39:43.094 --> 01:39:45.435]  I mean, these are brazen criminals.
[01:39:46.355 --> 01:39:47.996]  Well, you've got, you've got, look, it's very simple.
[01:39:48.056 --> 01:39:49.016]  We can deal with it.
[01:39:49.636 --> 01:40:00.240]  If the American people have the guts to do so, and the temperament and their direction is strong right now, as you probably know, that if you move this President, Obama, out of office,
[01:40:01.232 --> 01:40:03.693]  On the basis of his charge that he's insane.
[01:40:04.693 --> 01:40:06.434]  That's under the 25th Amendment, Section 4.
[01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:11.716]  He qualifies for expulsion from the presidency on the basis of that.
[01:40:12.476 --> 01:40:15.497]  Also, at the same time, you've got other things.
[01:40:15.637 --> 01:40:19.119]  He's also committed crimes against the Constitution.
[01:40:19.819 --> 01:40:21.059]  The Libya war was a crime.
[01:40:21.079 --> 01:40:22.920]  It was a violation of the Constitution.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.601]  He's done many other things.
[01:40:24.681 --> 01:40:27.624]  Many of his so-called laws are violations of the Constitution.
[01:40:28.264 --> 01:40:39.453]  The attempt to prevent the Congress, members of the Congress, from appealing what was a fraud against the government in this war in Libya is typical.
[01:40:40.774 --> 01:40:42.315]  What people have to have the guts to do.
[01:40:43.016 --> 01:40:45.958]  Many people realize that Obama has to be out of office.
[01:40:46.739 --> 01:40:50.001]  What they're not realizing is he has to be out of office now.
[01:40:51.095 --> 01:40:52.436]  And there are two ways to get him out.
[01:40:53.317 --> 01:40:54.178]  One is to impeach him.
[01:40:54.718 --> 01:41:00.323]  But the other, the more immediate and more effective one, is the fact that he is clinically insane.
[01:41:01.163 --> 01:41:08.990]  And his insanity is of a very specific type, which is explicitly specified in the 25th Amendment, Section 4.
[01:41:10.351 --> 01:41:11.372]  All the evidence is there.
[01:41:12.252 --> 01:41:16.076]  Lift him out of the presidency, and I can guarantee you,
[01:41:17.729 --> 01:41:20.350]  A lot of things will change very quickly.
[01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:24.392]  Sure, and of course he is spoiled milk.
[01:41:24.412 --> 01:41:37.699]  I mean, he politically now has a lower approval rating than Richard Nixon at the bottom, and of course Jimmy Carter, but the Corzines and the Robert Rubins and the people behind him, they don't care.
[01:41:37.739 --> 01:41:39.940]  They're going ahead with this
[01:41:41.212 --> 01:41:45.013]  Homicidal eluding of the system.
[01:41:45.033 --> 01:41:47.873]  So my question is, I agree with your solutions on that front.
[01:41:48.233 --> 01:41:49.134]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:49.254 --> 01:41:50.354]  Great idea, sir.
[01:41:50.754 --> 01:41:53.554]  You called for it long before these crises even began.
[01:41:53.954 --> 01:41:56.735]  What I'm saying is, they don't appear to be stopping.
[01:41:57.155 --> 01:41:57.915]  They don't care.
[01:41:57.955 --> 01:42:05.577]  It's like Corzine making a 40-to-1 bet on Eurobonds and then stealing his account holder's private money.
[01:42:05.897 --> 01:42:07.117]  It's admitted to be illegal.
[01:42:07.637 --> 01:42:11.118]  The head of the CFTC's invested with him and just says we're going to allow it.
[01:42:11.398 --> 01:42:13.459]  I mean, they're entering a psycho land.
[01:42:13.819 --> 01:42:17.581]  Will they be allowed to just steal and destroy everything is my question.
[01:42:17.601 --> 01:42:22.182]  I mean, what does MF Global... You've got one vulnerability has come to one point.
[01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:32.046]  Right now, a few people with the guts in the world can sink the whole thing immediately and there are solutions.
[01:42:33.559 --> 01:42:43.869]  But the key thing here now, one thing, if you do this, one thing, you're going to uncork everything and give a chance to the United States and other nations to survive.
[01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:48.633]  That one thing is get this president out of office now!
[01:42:49.815 --> 01:42:57.182]  If you don't get him out now, you're probably going to have thermonuclear war, from which very few people will survive.
[01:42:58.422 --> 01:42:59.043]  So it's a choice.
[01:42:59.063 --> 01:43:04.909]  Have we ever got the guts to throw this bum out of office now when the evidence for it exists?
[01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:12.536]  Or are we going to be gutless and get into this kind of hell from which the human species itself might not exist?
[01:43:13.037 --> 01:43:15.559]  Do we have the guts to save the world?
[01:43:16.725 --> 01:43:18.527]  Well, how do you get rid of Obama?
[01:43:18.567 --> 01:43:23.350]  Because that would cause kind of a breakup of things and allow new ideas to be injected.
[01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:25.552]  Because clearly he is narcissistic.
[01:43:25.892 --> 01:43:31.596]  Clearly he's constantly partying and in la-la land and playing golf six hours a day.
[01:43:31.616 --> 01:43:35.839]  I mean, you look at him, he does act like he's completely out of his mind.
[01:43:36.359 --> 01:43:37.500]  And he's a British puppet.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.161]  He's not an American.
[01:43:40.722 --> 01:43:42.704]  That election of his was a big fraud.
[01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:54.904]  The complications of how this was pulled, but mainly it was British money, and British drug money, which was the big factor in flooding him into the presidency.
[01:43:55.624 --> 01:44:05.107]  Actually, on the basis of counting the votes in one way, on the Democratic side, he lost the Democratic nomination, in fact.
[01:44:05.907 --> 01:44:11.249]  But because of a special feature, the way the thing was run, he was put in as the nominee.
[01:44:12.301 --> 01:44:12.961]  For the election.
[01:44:13.221 --> 01:44:14.142]  A Democratic nominee.
[01:44:14.622 --> 01:44:16.103]  He shouldn't have been there in the first place.
[01:44:16.143 --> 01:44:17.723]  Well, how does getting rid of Obama help?
[01:44:17.783 --> 01:44:19.644]  I mean, I... How does that help?
[01:44:20.324 --> 01:44:28.448]  I can guarantee you personally that getting rid of Obama in this way, in this time, and you'll save the United States.
[01:44:28.828 --> 01:44:38.572]  If you don't do this, if you don't get Obama out now, in this time, when the legal basis for doing so exists very clearly, then you're not going to save the United States.
[01:44:38.592 --> 01:44:40.333]  No, but explain to me the chain reaction.
[01:44:40.934 --> 01:44:55.703]  What is that vacuum if this puppet of the corrupt elements of Wall Street and finance capital, if he was removed for all the Fast and Furious, the illegal wars, you know, the mafia stuff, the list goes on and on.
[01:44:55.743 --> 01:44:56.164]  Look at it.
[01:44:57.144 --> 01:44:59.266]  The American people hate this guy now.
[01:45:00.347 --> 01:45:00.787]  They hate him.
[01:45:02.011 --> 01:45:03.212]  And they hate him for good reasons.
[01:45:05.634 --> 01:45:07.295]  There's nothing protecting him.
[01:45:07.496 --> 01:45:18.685]  If you take away, take out of his hands, the powers of the President, at that instant, you're going to get a sudden change in the United States.
[01:45:19.125 --> 01:45:21.367]  Because the people in the United States are ready for it.
[01:45:21.967 --> 01:45:24.529]  The problem is, many of them don't have the guts
[01:45:25.529 --> 01:45:26.629]  to do what they should do.
[01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:50.010]  And the choice is, take Obama out of the picture.
[01:45:50.030 --> 01:46:06.165]  So you're saying it's that symbolic symbol of the puppet would-be dictator removed, will send shockwaves through the structure, there won't be that executive fear factor, it'll be seen as a blow, a vote against the direction we're going, and will automatically steer energy towards other solutions.
[01:46:06.585 --> 01:46:11.390]  It will also cause elements of the government, and key parts of the government,
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.780]  To take the action that's needed.
[01:46:14.381 --> 01:46:29.164]  And they have, with Obama out, not in the White House, not empowered in the White House, those other elements of our federal government, which I know will act in an appropriate way to end this nonsense.
[01:46:30.284 --> 01:46:38.786]  That does not mean we're going to have everything solved automatically, but we're going to have the power of the decision to decide what is done, given back to the American people.
[01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:40.572]  And that will happen.
[01:46:40.652 --> 01:46:43.620]  The anger in this population, in the U.S.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:47.350]  population against what's being done to them, what has been done to them.
[01:46:48.137 --> 01:46:49.377]  They are ready to act.
[01:46:50.198 --> 01:46:53.899]  They're not mobilized in their mind as to know how to act.
[01:46:54.399 --> 01:46:57.580]  We have to put in their hands the means to act.
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:10.063]  And once they realize we've given them the means to act, and made some suggestions of what the measures are that have to be dealt with in order to bring this about, I can guarantee you, if I weren't as old as I am,
[01:47:11.357 --> 01:47:17.142]  I'd be running for president on the basis of filling in the absent term of Obama.
[01:47:17.442 --> 01:47:19.064]  And so you could inject real issues.
[01:47:19.104 --> 01:47:23.227]  Now expanding on this, looking at what's currently happening.
[01:47:24.116 --> 01:47:27.197]  I know you have amazing sources in government, the military, you name it.
[01:47:27.237 --> 01:47:29.338]  That's been admitted by the Washington Post and others.
[01:47:30.398 --> 01:47:34.699]  I mean, again, former head of the National Security Council said you have the best private intelligence network out there.
[01:47:34.959 --> 01:47:38.580]  And I'm getting, through my feelers, the same things you're getting.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.401]  And a lot of it, of course, months later manifests in the mainstream news.
[01:47:41.681 --> 01:47:48.103]  So there's major credibility here from my position, your position, our research, our history of giving people factual information.
[01:47:48.783 --> 01:47:53.385]  People can debate our analysis of the info, but the info stands on its own.
[01:47:54.950 --> 01:48:07.485]  You say you're being told that the military has already said no to launching this new World War III that so many Obama advisers have asked him to launch so that... Well, the relevant evidence... elements entered the U.S.
[01:48:07.525 --> 01:48:08.205]  command structure.
[01:48:09.026 --> 01:48:14.573]  And we're in a situation now where we're dealing with people in other countries as well on this question.
[01:48:15.073 --> 01:48:15.594]  We have to.
[01:48:16.801 --> 01:48:18.923]  We have to get the coordination.
[01:48:19.444 --> 01:48:24.148]  We have significant cooperation for doing what is necessary.
[01:48:24.348 --> 01:48:27.511]  Number one, no thermonuclear war.
[01:48:28.612 --> 01:48:35.879]  Which means no repetition of Libya, no war in Syria, no war against Iran.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.004]  Because all these wars, if they are allowed to occur, will mean thermonuclear war.
[01:48:43.291 --> 01:48:44.432]  Once the trigger is set.
[01:48:44.452 --> 01:48:46.833]  Because now you're on China and Russia's border, yes.
[01:48:47.934 --> 01:48:49.315]  No, not just on that.
[01:48:50.175 --> 01:48:53.317]  You've got a situation in which the power to declare war
[01:48:55.049 --> 01:48:57.150]  Which is now in the hands of the President.
[01:48:57.911 --> 01:49:00.912]  And he's not going to listen to anybody else while he's still President.
[01:49:01.292 --> 01:49:12.919]  It's setting a very dangerous President, and just like Hitler, or of course, we have the examples of other people, like Napoleon, once they start down this road we can clearly see
[01:49:13.379 --> 01:49:14.120]  We're good to go.
[01:49:28.502 --> 01:49:32.663]  Basically, rebellions against launching these new attacks.
[01:49:33.223 --> 01:49:42.666]  There is a special group of people who have the authority to put their voice in and to say whether a war should be launched or not.
[01:49:43.447 --> 01:49:46.287]  As long as the chance is there, as long as we're not attacked.
[01:49:47.148 --> 01:49:53.710]  And now the point is, if this president is in charge, he is going to pull the strings under British orders.
[01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:57.891]  It's going to be British orders, but it's going to be American muscle.
[01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:04.658]  We have the greatest concentration of thermonuclear warfare capability stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean.
[01:50:04.678 --> 01:50:05.138]  It's U.S.
[01:50:05.178 --> 01:50:05.579]  largely.
[01:50:06.119 --> 01:50:08.381]  It has the other jokers in.
[01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:10.503]  And also in the Persian Gulf.
[01:50:10.964 --> 01:50:17.590]  We have enough thermonuclear power based there to try to take out Asia.
[01:50:19.449 --> 01:50:20.811]  And you're right.
[01:50:20.851 --> 01:50:29.600]  And by the way, it's admitted, especially in the foreign press, the Russians are buzzing around like an anthill that's been disturbed right now on total defense alert.
[01:50:30.041 --> 01:50:31.923]  Let's come back and talk about this straight ahead.
[01:50:32.583 --> 01:50:38.009]  And Russia's saying, you move the missiles, we know you've moved in, into Poland, we're going to go ahead and attack.
[01:50:39.331 --> 01:50:41.033]  So, I mean, it's just total
[01:50:42.153 --> 01:50:45.278]  Red alert right now, and it's because the banksters are making their move.
[01:50:46.059 --> 01:50:48.723]  They're making their move, and they are completely crazy.
[01:50:48.883 --> 01:50:51.507]  It's like Max Keiser says, they're suicide bankers.
[01:50:51.948 --> 01:50:53.090]  Lennon LaRouche is our guest.
[01:50:53.210 --> 01:50:54.392]  Amazing information.
[01:50:54.412 --> 01:50:54.852]  Straight ahead.
[01:50:57.023 --> 01:51:00.224]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:51:00.544 --> 01:51:05.965]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:51:06.585 --> 01:51:06.925]  Why?
[01:51:07.225 --> 01:51:11.226]  When you can be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.
[01:51:11.546 --> 01:51:22.609]  With Le Cig e-cigarettes revolutionary microelectronic technology, rechargeable battery, and unique replacement cartridges, you'll get all the satisfaction of smoking, but no smoking hazards.

[01:51:36.339 --> 01:51:42.163]  LeCig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[01:51:42.443 --> 01:51:49.388]  Warning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or cancer.
[01:51:49.568 --> 01:51:52.870]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use.
[01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:55.471]  You must be 18 years or older to purchase.
[01:51:56.252 --> 01:52:00.914]  After work, I just want to plop down on the couch and watch TV alone.
[01:52:01.234 --> 01:52:01.875]  Come on!
[01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:02.835]  Don't be like that!
[01:52:03.075 --> 01:52:03.696]  Who are you?
[01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:11.560]  I'm you, 20 years ago, when you were full of energy, better shape, great attitude, and you didn't do so bad with the ladies.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.764]  Now that you're older, your testosterone levels are dropping and, well, you're not the guy you used to be.
[01:52:17.104 --> 01:52:19.225]  I'd give anything to feel like you again.
[01:52:19.486 --> 01:52:21.147]  Just try Ageless Male.
[01:52:21.347 --> 01:52:26.050]  It's a natural supplement, proven in a clinical trial to boost testosterone 61%.

[01:52:34.016 --> 01:52:37.540]  Not to mention a better mood and more drive in your romantic life.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:38.901]  More drive, huh?
[01:52:39.222 --> 01:52:41.043]  I really need to try Ageless Mail.
[01:52:41.204 --> 01:52:42.045]  Where's my phone?
[01:52:42.405 --> 01:52:43.326]  You're laying on it.

[01:52:57.821 --> 01:52:59.043]  Water filters, check.
[01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:00.745]  Gold and silver, check.
[01:53:01.145 --> 01:53:02.366]  Tactical gear, check.
[01:53:02.747 --> 01:53:04.969]  What's missing from your survival checklist?
[01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:07.732]  An essential that should not be taken for granted.

[01:53:10.456 --> 01:53:10.876]  Since many
[01:53:10.896 --> 01:53:14.201]  Many foods do not contain the essential micronutrients your body needs.
[01:53:14.462 --> 01:53:20.090]  You need Survival RX, the world's first ultra-long-term, storable vitamins and nutritional supplements.

[01:54:10.014 --> 01:54:13.242]  Passing secret arrests, indefinite detention for American citizens.
[01:54:16.593 --> 01:54:18.373]  Internet kill switches, all of it.
[01:54:18.453 --> 01:54:19.214]  It is crazy.
[01:54:19.754 --> 01:54:25.315]  But throughout all of this, we've backed off this move to attack Iran two or three times.
[01:54:25.575 --> 01:54:30.116]  And cooler heads can prevail here, but the financial crisis sits on top of that.
[01:54:30.496 --> 01:54:34.557]  Lyndon LaRouche has been gracious enough to stay with us 20 minutes to the next hour, because we got him on late today.
[01:54:34.597 --> 01:54:37.378]  We're going to him here in just a moment.
[01:54:38.514 --> 01:54:42.196]  Before I go any further, I want to thank our sponsors for making the show possible.
[01:54:42.796 --> 01:54:44.276]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:54:45.377 --> 01:54:49.538]  We're being forcibly medicated by fluoride and the water supply, all the other toxins and runoff.
[01:54:49.918 --> 01:54:51.279]  Purewater Freedom gives you a choice.
[01:54:51.299 --> 01:54:53.400]  You can remove fluoride from every water source in your home.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:54.960]  The whole house fluoride system.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.001]  They also have tabletops.
[01:54:56.661 --> 01:54:57.621]  It's all made in America.
[01:54:58.522 --> 01:54:59.042]  They've got it all.
[01:54:59.082 --> 01:54:59.982]  It's a one-stop shop.
[01:55:00.002 --> 01:55:01.123]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:55:01.503 --> 01:55:02.983]  All their filters are made in the USA.
[01:55:03.043 --> 01:55:04.544]  Again, purewaterfreedom.com.

[01:55:07.225 --> 01:55:10.990]  And lastly, our friends over at Inner Health Botanicals are a fantastic company.

[01:55:40.698 --> 01:55:44.180]  Innerfood, E-N-E-R, food.com, 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:52.926]  Don't forget, we've got two more days left of the free 15-day free trial at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:52.946 --> 01:55:56.869]  And I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, with the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:55:57.329 --> 01:56:01.972]  And it is your support of our sponsors and everything that you do that makes this transmission possible.
[01:56:02.713 --> 01:56:03.874]  Lyndon LaRouche is our guest.
[01:56:03.894 --> 01:56:04.814]  You were getting back to
[01:56:06.144 --> 01:56:06.824]  Nuclear war.
[01:56:07.125 --> 01:56:12.647]  What does it mean to have the Russians on alert, sending their ships into the Mediterranean?
[01:56:14.548 --> 01:56:16.369]  As you said, they've moved all these U.S.
[01:56:16.409 --> 01:56:17.890]  cruisers and subs in with nukes.
[01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:22.732]  Like you're saying, the military buildup is not for a conventional war.
[01:56:23.012 --> 01:56:23.773]  Please continue.
[01:56:24.453 --> 01:56:25.434]  It's not a conventional war.
[01:56:25.454 --> 01:56:26.474]  There is no conventional war.
[01:56:26.954 --> 01:56:28.335]  A conventional war is not possible.
[01:56:28.435 --> 01:56:33.398]  Actually, since the time when I was launching what became known as the STI,
[01:56:34.538 --> 01:56:42.140]  And the SDI principle, even though the circumstances are modified today, by time, nonetheless, the same principle is crucial.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:51.123]  There can be no major war on this planet that is involving major powers, which does not lead to thermonuclear war.
[01:56:51.143 --> 01:56:56.444]  In other words, with Libya, you came up to the edge of it.
[01:56:57.228 --> 01:57:06.030]  But it was already the potential back in the 1970s when I first got on doing this thing on the SDI program.
[01:57:07.511 --> 01:57:16.373]  Because it was impossible to fight major war with major powers involved that would not lead to thermonuclear war.
[01:57:17.578 --> 01:57:20.600]  That's been the state of affairs since the 1970s.
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:24.101]  Well, Cheney tried to do it through NATO with the Russians in 2008.
[01:57:24.521 --> 01:57:32.245]  The Russians just rolled mobile nukes in and said, and the head of their Joint Chiefs went on TV and said, we're preparing to launch nukes on your forces.
[01:57:32.705 --> 01:57:33.606]  And NATO turned back.
[01:57:33.826 --> 01:57:35.447]  I mean, what's wrong with NATO?
[01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:36.689]  What's wrong?
[01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:37.870]  Well, what's wrong with everybody?
[01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:47.734]  But the point is, the coward is... I mean, Nixon, or rather, Reagan, twice put up the SDI as a solution.
[01:57:48.254 --> 01:57:49.235]  The British stopped it.
[01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:51.196]  The United States was considering it.
[01:57:51.716 --> 01:57:55.598]  But the British intervened and said, as your big ally, we say no.
[01:57:56.298 --> 01:57:57.799]  And that's why Reagan was turned down.
[01:57:57.839 --> 01:58:02.181]  Then you've got a couple of British agents on drop-off and garbage-off.
[01:58:03.052 --> 01:58:06.714]  Who became one of the key figures in Russia and the Soviet Union then.
[01:58:07.155 --> 01:58:08.796]  And they were the responsible.
[01:58:09.016 --> 01:58:10.237]  Gorbachev is still around.
[01:58:10.617 --> 01:58:12.278]  He's still a damn nuisance in the world.
[01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:13.919]  And a pesky one.
[01:58:13.939 --> 01:58:14.820]  He's a British agent.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.061]  He always was.
[01:58:17.208 --> 01:58:17.748]  Incredible.
[01:58:17.848 --> 01:58:19.469]  Lenoreux, you're with us for 20 more minutes.
[01:58:19.489 --> 01:58:20.650]  We've got a quick break.
[01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:21.911]  The breaks are at the end of the hour and the start.

[01:58:23.472 --> 01:58:28.154]  Explain to us, because I looked it up, you really were instrumental in developing the SDI program.
[01:58:29.155 --> 01:58:34.858]  I want to get your view on what your program of SDI would have done to understand this total war concept we're now under.

[02:00:00.953 --> 02:00:01.594]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.254 --> 02:00:03.295]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:04.036 --> 02:00:05.137]  Government cover-ups.

[02:00:13.104 --> 02:00:17.228]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.188 --> 02:00:22.592]  I want people to understand that I genuinely believe what I'm talking about here.
[02:00:22.973 --> 02:00:24.814]  And we've predicted and told you everything that's coming.
[02:00:25.615 --> 02:00:30.178]  And no amount of trillions of dollars pumped into Europe will stop the rivetous black hole.
[02:00:30.499 --> 02:00:39.065]  The banksters know that and they think they can pose and use the controlled media to come out on top and be our saviors in the crisis they created.
[02:00:40.342 --> 02:00:46.147]  And in all these public papers they put out, they say, Obama needs a new Oklahoma City to blame on people.
[02:00:46.227 --> 02:00:47.369]  Financial Times of London.
[02:00:47.709 --> 02:00:49.110]  They act like we're not even here.
[02:00:49.531 --> 02:00:51.472]  Mr. LaRouche, you've studied these people a long time.
[02:00:51.913 --> 02:00:54.535]  Is it megalomania, hubris?
[02:00:55.276 --> 02:00:56.977]  Or do they really think they're going to win?
[02:00:57.358 --> 02:00:59.460]  Why are they so naked in what they do?
[02:01:01.882 --> 02:01:02.883]  Get into SDI.
[02:01:03.223 --> 02:01:04.444]  Where we're going, all of this.
[02:01:05.265 --> 02:01:07.266]  Well, look at the history of the United States.
[02:01:07.686 --> 02:01:26.475]  And it actually started in 1620, when some people from England and from probably the Netherlands as well, came over to Massachusetts and set into motion what was initially the Pilgrim Landing, but then was the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
[02:01:27.095 --> 02:01:31.437]  Now the Massachusetts Bay Colony was crushed with the
[02:01:32.719 --> 02:01:34.280]  By the British, at a certain point.
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:36.561]  But we didn't stop there.
[02:01:37.461 --> 02:01:39.722]  We continued to develop a United States.
[02:01:39.762 --> 02:01:44.184]  We imported people from Europe and so forth into what became the United States.
[02:01:44.784 --> 02:01:51.067]  And we continued from 1620 on through the securing of our freedom, our constitutional freedom.
[02:01:51.948 --> 02:01:59.231]  We continued as an alternative to Britain, to the British Empire, which had become an empire in that period.
[02:02:00.416 --> 02:02:05.181]  So we were the English-speaking, we drew people from all over Europe at first.
[02:02:05.881 --> 02:02:11.247]  And then later we drew from Asia as well in the later part of the period, going into the 20th century.
[02:02:11.987 --> 02:02:23.879]  We created in the United States the greatest movement for freedom that mankind has ever known, for the greatest duration, against what was still going on in Europe.
[02:02:25.495 --> 02:02:35.402]  It wasn't that the Europeans lacked a culture, a European culture, but they lacked an effective culture because their system of government was dominated by the British Empire ever since 1763.
[02:02:36.963 --> 02:02:43.668]  The British Empire has dominated Europe, with a few brief exceptions, through the entire period.
[02:02:43.888 --> 02:02:45.329]  They control Africa totally.
[02:02:46.311 --> 02:02:51.834]  They controlled and committed mass genocide in India to consolidate their power there.
[02:02:52.374 --> 02:02:54.895]  They ran the drug war against China.
[02:02:55.735 --> 02:03:03.399]  They organized World War I, but they started already with the assassination of the President of France at that time.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:13.484]  So this operation, this empire, this imperial system, which controls Africa as a slave state entirely still today,
[02:03:14.608 --> 02:03:15.609]  Which controls Europe.
[02:03:15.729 --> 02:03:21.454]  For example, today in Europe, most in Western and Central Europe, no sovereign nation-state exists!
[02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:23.675]  Western Europe.
[02:03:24.515 --> 02:03:29.657]  They all lost their authority to the Euro system, which has no government.
[02:03:30.197 --> 02:03:33.478]  The government is the British government, which runs the Euro system.
[02:03:33.678 --> 02:03:42.321]  And then acts like it's being abused by the Euro, but if you look, helps set up the Treaty of Rome in 57 on record.
[02:03:42.821 --> 02:03:43.641]  They run everything.
[02:03:44.101 --> 02:03:45.922]  And the point is, it's still us, we,
[02:03:47.322 --> 02:03:52.603]  Because we do represent, and you know, from generation to generation, we die, you know, in time.
[02:03:52.823 --> 02:03:53.423]  Everyone dies.
[02:03:53.983 --> 02:03:54.803]  But we aren't dead.
[02:03:55.584 --> 02:03:59.464]  Because we are committed to a principle which lives on after we die.
[02:04:00.264 --> 02:04:09.106]  And those of us in the United States who still believe and stand by that principle, which we embedded and expressed in our Constitution, still exists.
[02:04:09.766 --> 02:04:12.867]  The problem is, other people become confused.
[02:04:13.894 --> 02:04:15.255]  Or they're doubtful of their powers.
[02:04:15.835 --> 02:04:17.557]  They're doubtful of their ability to intervene.
[02:04:18.337 --> 02:04:32.387]  When we make a decision, like as I propose we must make in the United States now, throw this bum out, I guarantee you, you will get a surge of response from our American people in a very large number.
[02:04:33.331 --> 02:04:35.693]  We'll look at this as a sign of relief.
[02:04:36.134 --> 02:04:36.654]  Exactly.
[02:04:36.674 --> 02:04:41.359]  It would be seen as a major signal, you know, kind of like the cavalry coming.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:43.081]  Stay right there.
[02:04:43.101 --> 02:04:44.482]  Leonard LaRouche, final segment with him.
[02:04:44.762 --> 02:04:51.228]  Get into other economic topics with him and talk about these gathering megastorm clouds and a lot more.
[02:04:51.309 --> 02:04:51.869]  Stay with us.
[02:04:51.889 --> 02:04:52.530]  We'll be right back.

[02:07:08.328 --> 02:07:15.353]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[02:08:01.107 --> 02:08:05.370]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:06.771]  You want answers?
[02:08:07.551 --> 02:08:08.512]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:09.072 --> 02:08:12.694]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.275 --> 02:08:17.397]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.598 --> 02:08:23.761]  Alright, we've got one final segment with LaRouche, and I'm gonna take some phone calls and get into some other news we haven't covered.
[02:08:25.362 --> 02:08:26.683]  Website's larouchepac.com.
[02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:35.515]  You know, I really wish this stuff wasn't true or real.
[02:08:35.855 --> 02:08:52.224]  I mean, I can't think about anything but the financial situation, the dollar devaluation, the depression, all the numbers coming out, a design depression, a bunch of control freaks waging war against our society, command destruction.
[02:08:52.244 --> 02:08:54.145]  It's incredible.
[02:08:55.069 --> 02:09:04.496]  Helene LaRouche was talking about the American system versus this imperial, crony, centralized, neo-feudal system.
[02:09:05.998 --> 02:09:10.641]  And the whole eugenics situation, this anti-human movement.
[02:09:11.522 --> 02:09:20.169]  And there's no doubt they're barreling towards megabanks owning Europe and all their sovereignty transferred to it.
[02:09:21.363 --> 02:09:27.266]  And they call it a United States of Europe as a sick joke as if a financial tyranny is the United States model?
[02:09:28.426 --> 02:09:30.527]  It's like calling the Patriot Act patriotic.
[02:09:31.408 --> 02:09:44.254]  Lyndon LaRouche, I wanted to ask you about the bill that was passed last night that says the government, the military, can operate in America and arrest citizens and hold them without trial for no reason.
[02:09:45.675 --> 02:09:50.297]  And I played clips earlier of Lindsey Graham, the sponsor of it, admitting that.
[02:09:51.690 --> 02:09:54.911]  And then Obama plays this cheeky game of saying, well, I'm not going to sign it.
[02:09:55.251 --> 02:09:57.872]  That's because last year he said, I can hold citizens and use the army.
[02:09:57.932 --> 02:09:58.793]  I don't need a law.
[02:09:59.273 --> 02:10:00.653]  He's saying, I have the executive.
[02:10:00.673 --> 02:10:03.775]  So a lot of just amazing things happening.
[02:10:03.795 --> 02:10:06.416]  Now they've got a new bill to allow torture.
[02:10:06.976 --> 02:10:08.977]  That article's up at Infowars.com.
[02:10:09.037 --> 02:10:12.038]  Headline, Senate considers bill authorizing more torture.
[02:10:13.895 --> 02:10:16.778]  And the news is just running around acting like it's a great thing.
[02:10:17.099 --> 02:10:18.480]  This is so incredible.
[02:10:18.981 --> 02:10:20.683]  What if they have their way?
[02:10:20.743 --> 02:10:23.146]  You've talked about solutions and different systems.
[02:10:23.646 --> 02:10:25.789]  If they continue, if this group continues...
[02:10:28.624 --> 02:10:33.007]  If we don't act now, we're going to find we're in a thermonuclear war.
[02:10:33.028 --> 02:10:33.728]  It's going to happen.
[02:10:54.793 --> 02:10:58.675]  If we don't act now, to get this President out of office.
[02:10:59.535 --> 02:11:03.157]  If you don't pull this President out of office, you're going to have a thermonuclear war.
[02:11:04.358 --> 02:11:09.120]  Now, if we don't have him out of office, don't worry about anything, you're all going to be dead anyway.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:22.066]  The British policy, and they said it, the British Royal Family, the extended family, the whole blue-blooded crowd, have said repeatedly, they are now committed to the immediate objective
[02:11:22.765 --> 02:11:28.346]  I'm reducing the world's population from seven billion people to one or less.
[02:11:29.527 --> 02:11:31.947]  That is the policy of the British monarchy.
[02:11:33.127 --> 02:11:39.829]  The British monarchy controls all of Europe from the Atlantic into Central Europe.
[02:11:40.869 --> 02:11:41.329]  Directly.
[02:11:41.769 --> 02:11:43.210]  They control the Euro system.
[02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.950]  Control.
[02:11:44.130 --> 02:11:44.470]  Totally.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:55.827]  They control the forces that are being, including our stupid forces themselves, who are working under Obama's direction, under British direction, for a war in the Middle East.
[02:11:55.967 --> 02:12:01.871]  And it will be a thermonuclear war, because it will not be limited to Iran, it will not be limited to Syria.
[02:12:02.512 --> 02:12:04.373]  It will go to the entirety of Asia.
[02:12:05.566 --> 02:12:06.406]  That's what's at stake.
[02:12:06.506 --> 02:12:11.508]  Look at the amount of force, look at the thermonuclear and related capability of the U.S.
[02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:21.253]  and augmented forces from Europe and so forth, which are deployed in the Gulf of, you know, Iran, and in the eastern part of the Mediterranean.
[02:12:21.693 --> 02:12:24.254]  That force is there to fight a war.
[02:12:25.154 --> 02:12:29.216]  That war is not limited to Syria and to Iran.
[02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:45.087]  That war, once it starts, as the Russian deployment shows you, that war, when it starts, will be a thermonuclear war, as the President of Russia, in certain terms, have warned the world in the past two days.
[02:12:45.988 --> 02:12:47.450]  So the stage is set.
[02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:50.474]  The question is, who's going to come on stage?
[02:12:51.903 --> 02:12:55.947]  Is the American freedom going to come on stage and throw Obama out?
[02:12:56.228 --> 02:13:02.634]  Because if he don't throw Obama out, now when we have the charges for doing so, then we are condemned to this war.
[02:13:03.835 --> 02:13:07.019]  So we find the guts to win, or we lose.
[02:13:07.879 --> 02:13:12.484]  And no, it's not a question of what people think, you know, a decision, when you have to make a command decision.
[02:13:14.026 --> 02:13:14.927]  As a leader of a nation.
[02:13:15.948 --> 02:13:17.049]  Like the American Republic.
[02:13:17.829 --> 02:13:23.272]  There are times that comes that you have to make a decision on behalf of the people.
[02:13:24.593 --> 02:13:26.895]  Do you want what is happening to our people now?
[02:13:27.655 --> 02:13:31.457]  Do you think the majority of the people in this country wants what's happening to them now?
[02:13:32.138 --> 02:13:32.758]  Of course they don't.
[02:13:33.278 --> 02:13:39.242]  But they don't think they have the authority or the backing for someone to clean the mess up.
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:52.485]  And we all, we have in our terms of responsible people in the Senate, in the houses of Congress, in parties in part, they all in a sense more or less will agree on some things.
[02:13:53.205 --> 02:13:57.127]  But they hesitate to take on throwing out a president who should be thrown out.
[02:13:58.067 --> 02:14:08.856]  If somebody takes the guts and the qualifications to throw the bum out of office, I guarantee you, you will have a complete change in the policy of the American people in practice.
[02:14:09.277 --> 02:14:10.338]  And we can win this thing.
[02:14:10.798 --> 02:14:12.479]  But we don't have much time.
[02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:16.022]  I agree with you, we don't have much time.
[02:14:16.062 --> 02:14:21.467]  And everyone I talk to, not just geopolitically, not just intellectually, in everybody's gut,
[02:14:22.861 --> 02:14:24.202]  People are really concerned.
[02:14:25.343 --> 02:14:27.004]  And, you know, I go back to MF Global.
[02:14:27.024 --> 02:14:33.829]  I mean, they've never taken $3 billion of people's private accounts and just said, we're not even going to investigate, we're keeping the money.
[02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:35.110]  And now they're doing that.
[02:14:35.150 --> 02:14:47.720]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, there may have been a method to the madness before, but when you talk about an inbred power structure, who a lot of them are just educated idiots, the sky's the limit.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:50.202]  I mean, this is like Caligula or Nero.
[02:14:50.662 --> 02:14:52.524]  Understanding history, Lyndon LaRouche,
[02:14:54.491 --> 02:14:59.014]  And knowing what the breaks are right now, what do you see happening?
[02:14:59.174 --> 02:15:05.757]  I mean, you said with your intelligence and Pentagon connections, high-level groups are telling them no, no, no.
[02:15:06.038 --> 02:15:07.758]  But is that enough to stop them?
[02:15:08.119 --> 02:15:09.119]  Is that a good sign?
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.541]  What are folks there in Virginia and D.C.
[02:15:13.362 --> 02:15:15.503]  at the highest levels you talk to, what are they telling you?
[02:15:15.703 --> 02:15:17.644]  What are the Europeans you talk to telling you?
[02:15:17.664 --> 02:15:18.965]  How does Israel fit into all this?
[02:15:19.713 --> 02:15:21.253]  Oh, Israel is a puppet.
[02:15:21.793 --> 02:15:23.374]  That's not really an issue.
[02:15:24.114 --> 02:15:27.015]  The issue here is, what's the United States going to do?
[02:15:27.435 --> 02:15:28.855]  And what are other countries going to do?
[02:15:29.195 --> 02:15:42.618]  I can guarantee you, if we throw Obama out of office, we're going to have cooperation, full cooperation, from Russia, from China, probably from India, and from other countries.
[02:15:43.675 --> 02:15:53.700]  We're going to find that the world is going to have a kind of unity at the moment before Franklin Roosevelt died, when we virtually had won World War II.
[02:15:55.201 --> 02:16:13.070]  People are now at a point of anxiety that if somebody puts the solution before a hungry man on a plate, and the man, hungry man, is seeing his children starving, and somebody's going to come up with a solution, they're not going to have to be very fussy
[02:16:13.954 --> 02:16:16.396]  About finding out why they're doing what they're doing.
[02:16:17.877 --> 02:16:18.977]  They know what they're doing.
[02:16:19.098 --> 02:16:20.899]  They're trying to get their country back.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.902]  And we have most of the people in the United States want their country back.
[02:16:26.703 --> 02:16:40.152]  If a few of us, in responsible positions of leadership, act within the provinces of our Constitution, to take an action to throw this President out of office, even if the initiative is made by a relatively few people,
[02:16:41.164 --> 02:16:49.071]  If it's made, and made under the proper law, you'll find a rejoicing in the streets throughout much of the United States.
[02:16:50.172 --> 02:16:54.556]  And you'll be hiding Obama someplace where nobody can get at him, because you're not going to have him killed.
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:59.021]  Sure, go ahead, go ahead.
[02:16:59.521 --> 02:17:00.542]  That'll change everything.
[02:17:00.982 --> 02:17:04.285]  But the problem times it takes, leadership does mean something.
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:11.100]  There's bad leadership, but there are times when the world cries for someone to act.
[02:17:12.122 --> 02:17:13.523]  On behalf of justice.
[02:17:13.843 --> 02:17:32.017]  And you're just pointing out that even though it's symbolic and he's a puppet of very wicked people, the fact that their puppet falls and they don't go through the regular cycle of a new Republican puppet, that would be seen as a major point to crystallize some real ideas of sanity being brought in.
[02:17:32.297 --> 02:17:37.320]  But what about the same forces trying to bring in just another new puppet?
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:38.341]  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich.
[02:17:38.381 --> 02:17:39.162]  Look at all these people.
[02:17:39.867 --> 02:17:40.087]  I know.
[02:17:40.267 --> 02:17:43.009]  But let's take a look at D-Day.
[02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:46.592]  Look at the streets in New York City on D-Day.
[02:17:49.013 --> 02:17:50.174]  When we'd won the war.
[02:17:53.216 --> 02:17:56.379]  And if unfortunately we got Truman in instead of Roosevelt later.
[02:17:57.399 --> 02:18:00.241]  If Roosevelt had continued as President, we'd never have any of these problems.
[02:18:00.982 --> 02:18:08.227]  Sometimes our Chief Executive, or the circles which are our Chief Executive collectively, of our Constitution,
[02:18:08.817 --> 02:18:12.339]  When the people in our country do know something about our Constitution.
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:13.520]  They have some sense of it.
[02:18:14.721 --> 02:18:19.824]  But they may not know all the details, but they do know right from wrong in that sense.
[02:18:20.985 --> 02:18:26.609]  What's needed now is leadership in the United States which will remove this President from office immediately.
[02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:32.913]  That will put into play immediately in the Congress, especially in the Senate,
[02:18:34.184 --> 02:18:35.445]  And that is what we have to do now.
[02:18:55.595 --> 02:18:58.318]  There are no preconditions required for doing that.
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:01.422]  Give us some of the websites.
[02:19:01.442 --> 02:19:02.943]  There's larouchepac.com.
[02:19:03.103 --> 02:19:06.107]  There's also, what, Larouchepub, correct?
[02:19:06.727 --> 02:19:11.653]  Yeah, Larouchepub is a publication of our... I know you've got a lot of websites.
[02:19:11.693 --> 02:19:15.457]  I wanted to... You know, we're out of time and I don't want to twist your arm at any more time, but I...
[02:19:18.464 --> 02:19:38.423]  If we can, I want to go to break and do just five more minutes on the other side, because I want to ask you from your deep, deep study, and I read, you know, the intelligence briefing and the rest of it, just invaluable information, but I want to understand the deep mindset of the oligarchy and what they think they're going to get out of this, because obviously it's leading them like Hitler into Russia or
[02:19:39.364 --> 02:19:42.387]  Or are others on ill-fated journeys that they're not going to make it out of this?
[02:19:42.447 --> 02:19:46.350]  They may succeed in wrecking everything, but there's got to be a point when this ends.
[02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:52.596]  Lynn LaRouche, just give us five more minutes on the other side, and then we'll get into financial news and phone calls and a lot more.
[02:19:52.936 --> 02:19:53.717]  We'll be right back.

[02:23:57.141 --> 02:24:02.185]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[02:24:05.014 --> 02:24:18.984]  All right, my friends, it's our final segment with Lenin LaRouche.
[02:24:19.004 --> 02:24:20.825]  He's been very gracious to spend as much time with us.
[02:24:20.846 --> 02:24:21.426]  Very busy man.
[02:24:21.446 --> 02:24:24.228]  LaRouchePAC.com.
[02:24:25.589 --> 02:24:27.010]  And his analysis is spot on.
[02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:28.771]  You cannot deny we're at this point.
[02:24:29.612 --> 02:24:33.335]  Because the world is imploding, these globalists always start wars.
[02:24:34.642 --> 02:24:37.045]  And it is the British Empire model we face.
[02:24:37.065 --> 02:24:50.563]  So in closing, so that we know the enemy, not the English or British people or the UK, but that parasitic system there, that through all of Europe's wars developed the most cunning manipulative system ever seen,
[02:24:52.529 --> 02:24:53.110]  Who are they?
[02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:53.690]  What are they?
[02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:54.731]  What do they stand for?
[02:24:55.451 --> 02:24:57.313]  How do they see a way out in this?
[02:24:58.614 --> 02:25:15.948]  We don't know some of the history, but we do know that way back in the Mediterranean vicinity, there was a development of what were called oligarchical systems, in which a few people, a small part of the population, were treated, were called gods.
[02:25:16.709 --> 02:25:17.809]  They were treated as gods.
[02:25:18.670 --> 02:25:20.752]  And the ordinary people were treated as cattle.
[02:25:21.909 --> 02:25:32.714]  Now, that system of gods and cattle has continued in European civilization in particular, from that time to the present day in Great Britain.
[02:25:33.875 --> 02:25:39.178]  The British Empire is nothing but a revival of, again, for the fourth time,
[02:25:40.043 --> 02:25:54.209]  of a Roman Empire, which was started in Rome, which features such creatures as the Emperor Nero, and our current President of the United States has a personality identical psychologically, or pathologically, to the Emperor Nero.
[02:25:55.509 --> 02:26:02.312]  But we in the United States succeeded in establishing a system which was anti-oligarchical.
[02:26:03.248 --> 02:26:16.012]  In which the right of the individual citizen, as a citizen, was that of a human being, which had a right not only to live, but a right to pass on the meaning of their life to coming generations.
[02:26:17.093 --> 02:26:29.197]  And this was our special achievement in the United States, by the people who left England, left Belgium, and so forth, left Europe, and came to this territory to build up this United States.
[02:26:29.897 --> 02:26:32.718]  Now, we were weak relative to the British Empire.
[02:26:33.459 --> 02:26:36.141]  Because the British Empire does control the world.
[02:26:36.521 --> 02:26:38.723]  All of Africa is controlled by the British Empire.
[02:26:38.943 --> 02:26:40.084]  There's no exception to that.
[02:26:40.984 --> 02:26:43.186]  Most of the world is controlled by the British Empire.
[02:26:43.826 --> 02:26:44.907]  There's no exception to that.
[02:26:45.347 --> 02:26:53.293]  You have people within the system who are part of the imperial territory, who will resist inside the territory, but they won't break it.
[02:26:54.113 --> 02:27:02.559]  We in the United States, with all our failures, our failed presidents, our goofing up the issues, we have remained
[02:27:04.013 --> 02:27:12.980]  In the tradition of what the American system is, which was actually founded in Europe by other people, but was achieved in what became the United States.
[02:27:14.021 --> 02:27:19.084]  And therefore we have a special responsibility, and we are also respected.
[02:27:19.885 --> 02:27:22.427]  For example, in Asia we tend to get respect.
[02:27:23.297 --> 02:27:27.240]  Because we're opponents of this kind of oligarchical system.
[02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:31.583]  We've always been the great engine of at least the lofty ideals.
[02:27:31.623 --> 02:27:34.005]  Didn't mean we ever properly lived up to it.
[02:27:34.545 --> 02:27:44.352]  And to see America now used as an engine of corruption, to see other countries use us as an excuse to engage in tyranny, that's got to please the finance oligarchs.
[02:27:45.173 --> 02:27:47.355]  Yeah, but the point is, what does it hurt?
[02:27:48.135 --> 02:27:50.377]  It hurts every parent who has children.
[02:27:51.894 --> 02:27:57.796]  Because the secret of the United States does not lie in those of us who are living, or who have lived.
[02:27:58.976 --> 02:28:08.559]  The secret of our United States lies in the heritage of creativity and related benefits which we pass on to the future.
[02:28:08.959 --> 02:28:13.621]  We may die, but we live in what we contribute to the future.
[02:28:14.631 --> 02:28:19.836]  That's the difference of our system and the typical British oligarchical system.
[02:28:19.876 --> 02:28:20.236]  That's right.
[02:28:20.256 --> 02:28:22.498]  Their birthright is only to the oligarchy.
[02:28:22.759 --> 02:28:30.005]  This is a birthright of free humanity, goodwill, peace, true liberty, true human revolution against tyranny.
[02:28:30.506 --> 02:28:36.852]  And as the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, it all talks about the posterity, the living thing.
[02:28:37.232 --> 02:28:39.014]  And it is a living thing.
[02:28:40.181 --> 02:28:44.905]  Yeah, see, we're living in a galaxy, not just a solar system.
[02:28:44.925 --> 02:28:46.126]  We're living inside a galaxy.
[02:28:46.786 --> 02:28:50.589]  This galaxy, for some of us who study these things, has a history.
[02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:56.874]  It has a history in terms of the forms of life over the last half-billion years, which we know something about.
[02:28:58.095 --> 02:29:02.619]  And in this we find the emergence of the species, from single subspecies on the way up.
[02:29:03.479 --> 02:29:06.421]  We finally get into the antecedents of mankind.
[02:29:07.281 --> 02:29:10.384]  With the passage of the dinosaurs and people like that, and things like that.
[02:29:11.184 --> 02:29:14.087]  And we have become a conscious factor.
[02:29:14.447 --> 02:29:18.871]  Animals don't have a conscious factor in shaping what the destiny of these animal species will be.
[02:29:19.271 --> 02:29:20.352]  Human beings do.
[02:29:21.233 --> 02:29:27.318]  And what is immortal in us is our power of the imagination, the creative imagination,
[02:29:27.958 --> 02:29:33.139]  To develop the ideas of what mankind shall be and how it shall function.
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:36.300]  True self-determination, truly taking control of our development.
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:38.321]  We'll have to have you back on this subject alone.
[02:29:38.361 --> 02:29:40.402]  Lyndon LaRouche, incredible information.
[02:29:40.662 --> 02:29:41.442]  Thank you for your time.
[02:29:41.462 --> 02:29:41.942]  We'll be back.
[02:29:41.962 --> 02:29:42.462]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.583 --> 02:29:46.463]  We're on the march.
[02:29:46.963 --> 02:29:48.544]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:49.484 --> 02:29:52.165]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.447 --> 02:30:01.348]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:01.708 --> 02:30:05.191]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:05.571 --> 02:30:07.853]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:08.033 --> 02:30:13.297]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:13.737 --> 02:30:19.982]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:20.402 --> 02:30:25.967]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:26.387 --> 02:30:30.030]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:30:30.530 --> 02:30:34.512]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:34.833 --> 02:30:40.756]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:40.776 --> 02:30:43.758]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:44.338 --> 02:30:45.739]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:46.319 --> 02:30:46.819]  It's here.

[02:30:58.903 --> 02:31:03.927]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:31:04.207 --> 02:31:05.568]  Saving means to make money.

[02:31:15.274 --> 02:31:22.375]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:31:22.796 --> 02:31:30.417]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:30.797 --> 02:31:35.718]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:31:55.802 --> 02:31:57.003]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:57.364 --> 02:32:03.170]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[02:32:03.671 --> 02:32:07.294]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[02:32:07.715 --> 02:32:10.898]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift.
[02:32:11.299 --> 02:32:16.925]  A supply of delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:32:41.755 --> 02:32:44.916]  Yeah, if you think you've seen the end of the tyranny, or even the beginning,
[02:33:10.461 --> 02:33:11.442]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:33:12.403 --> 02:33:17.026]  And you haven't seen what free humanity is going to do in response to tyranny.
[02:33:17.066 --> 02:33:22.931]  It isn't until the tyranny gets really naked that people start to fight back.
[02:33:22.991 --> 02:33:24.292]  And now it's getting to that point.
[02:33:24.853 --> 02:33:31.318]  The globalists have been experts at plenty of entertainment, plenty of dumbing down, ridiculing people that are awake and aware.
[02:33:33.490 --> 02:33:35.030]  But now it's not working anymore.
[02:33:35.131 --> 02:33:43.413]  So, because they know that we're awake to them and Congress has a 9% approval rating, Obama has an approval rating lower than Nixon or Jimmy Carter.
[02:33:43.753 --> 02:33:44.714]  That's in the news today.
[02:33:47.775 --> 02:33:50.675]  Because they know that we're awake now, they just don't care.
[02:33:50.715 --> 02:33:53.136]  They're like, alright, we'll just arrest you and hold you forever.
[02:33:53.156 --> 02:33:54.377]  Alright, we'll torture you.
[02:33:55.937 --> 02:33:58.418]  Alright, we're gonna go ahead and start taking your bank accounts and keeping them.
[02:34:08.407 --> 02:34:10.487]  I mean, I feel like somebody who's at the edge of a cliff right now.
[02:34:10.707 --> 02:34:14.228]  You ever jumped off 200, 300, 400 foot cliff into a lake?
[02:34:14.728 --> 02:34:17.489]  I've done it quite a few times back when I was younger and dumber.
[02:34:19.569 --> 02:34:23.810]  Now to jump off a high dive is kind of scary, but it's that same feeling.
[02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:24.690]  I mean, we're right there.
[02:34:25.370 --> 02:34:31.312]  And I'm sitting here, I read the globalist documents, I've been right about what I warned about, but it takes a while for this stuff to develop.
[02:34:32.012 --> 02:34:32.652]  And now we're here.
[02:34:33.232 --> 02:34:37.333]  And when we knew four years ago that the Pentagon refused to attack Iran,
[02:34:38.985 --> 02:34:40.006]  People said, oh, you're wrong.
[02:34:40.046 --> 02:34:40.947]  They weren't going to attack.
[02:34:40.987 --> 02:34:42.529]  See, and later it came out we were right.
[02:34:43.049 --> 02:34:44.210]  Well, they're getting ready again.
[02:34:44.231 --> 02:34:51.178]  And it's the ramifications of all of this, and where it goes, and Europe collapsing, and all of this.
[02:34:51.638 --> 02:34:52.980]  It's so incredible.
[02:34:54.321 --> 02:34:56.623]  Five or six calls before the transmission ends today.
[02:34:56.663 --> 02:34:57.724]  The toll-free number to join us.
[02:34:57.744 --> 02:35:00.627]  I want to get your take on what you've heard today or whatever issue you're raising.
[02:35:00.647 --> 02:35:00.807]  800-259-9231.
[02:35:00.827 --> 02:35:00.887]  800-259-9231.
[02:35:00.907 --> 02:35:03.430]  We had General Hamid Gul on, former head of Pakistani intelligence.
[02:35:03.650 --> 02:35:05.592]  In that situation, Lyndon LaRouche, of course.
[02:35:13.385 --> 02:35:14.746]  I just wish this wasn't happening.
[02:35:14.766 --> 02:35:17.029]  Believe me, I know why people bend over backwards to live in denial.
[02:35:38.968 --> 02:35:41.530]  But I remember Henry Paulson clearly in insider trading.
[02:35:41.850 --> 02:35:43.751]  Congress admits they involved in insider trading.
[02:35:43.791 --> 02:35:44.472]  Totally illegal.
[02:35:44.912 --> 02:35:45.953]  It's more than insider trading.
[02:35:45.993 --> 02:35:51.937]  They give government contracts and pass legislation for money to companies their own family members or executives of.
[02:35:52.637 --> 02:35:54.318]  And they say, well, when we do it, it's okay.
[02:35:54.698 --> 02:35:57.660]  We've given ourselves an exemption.
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:01.823]  And remember Henry Paulson when he was being questioned by Congressman Stern from Florida.
[02:36:02.984 --> 02:36:03.984]  It's an Obama deception.
[02:36:04.025 --> 02:36:07.427]  He said, who gave you the waiver to give yourself 200 and something million dollars?
[02:36:09.241 --> 02:36:09.801]  I don't know.
[02:36:30.680 --> 02:36:42.005]  I mean, the head of the CFTC, on record, is invested with Corzine and MF Global, and it turns out all these insiders got warnings, and of course nothing's going to happen to MF Global.
[02:36:42.025 --> 02:36:44.786]  I mean, that's the thing.
[02:36:44.826 --> 02:36:49.508]  They've reached a level of public crime that is just staggering.
[02:36:49.548 --> 02:36:54.651]  It's like ESPN with the wife of the coach saying, yeah, I watched them rape little boys.
[02:36:55.111 --> 02:36:56.812]  They had it for 10 years and covered it up.
[02:37:02.341 --> 02:37:03.422]  What have we turned into?
[02:37:03.482 --> 02:37:06.204]  We're just accustomed to giving in to evil.
[02:37:06.244 --> 02:37:07.605]  We're accustomed to accepting it.
[02:37:08.225 --> 02:37:13.489]  And then we're accustomed to all the new fines and fees and regulations being treated like absolute garbage.
[02:37:15.745 --> 02:37:18.286]  We've got to start acting like sovereigns.
[02:37:18.306 --> 02:37:19.787]  We've got to start acting like the bosses.
[02:37:20.128 --> 02:37:20.928]  It's we the people.
[02:37:20.968 --> 02:37:22.429]  This is our government, our country.
[02:37:22.969 --> 02:37:36.477]  And because we had some liberty, it created incredible wealth, and now all the crooks of the world ran in here, slowly took over, getting little pieces here, little pieces there, always making money, getting power out of it, and then now they've just gotten into total control.
[02:37:36.517 --> 02:37:39.899]  They're like, we'll torture you, we'll secret arrest you, we'll kill you if we want.
[02:37:42.039 --> 02:37:46.620]  They've already been doing all of that, but now they want to be able to go in to their people and say, here, you're allowed to do this.
[02:37:47.241 --> 02:37:55.844]  Now, a warning to their people, when the White House ordered people to torture, including children, when they got caught, they went ahead and sent the people that followed the orders to prison.
[02:37:57.844 --> 02:38:00.945]  And then Bush came out in his memoir last year and said, I ordered torture, I'd do it again.
[02:38:01.845 --> 02:38:02.766]  Keeping you safe.
[02:38:02.806 --> 02:38:03.306]  I mean, they know.
[02:38:03.546 --> 02:38:08.788]  They're selling the idea that if you give tyrants total control, they'll protect you.
[02:38:08.888 --> 02:38:09.148]  Really?
[02:38:11.465 --> 02:38:15.307]  Government is like an employee that literally has got you licking their boots.
[02:38:18.249 --> 02:38:19.129]  That's what's happened, okay.
[02:38:19.770 --> 02:38:23.992]  Coming up after some calls, foreclosure fraud, whistleblower found dead, MSNBC.
[02:38:25.413 --> 02:38:37.760]  Another one, Henry Paulson, Hank Paulson, gave hedge funds inside information on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae when he was Treasury Secretary.
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:44.564]  And it goes on to say, I'll cover that in a moment after some calls, but I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:38:45.265 --> 02:38:46.846]  Ted, can you feel the urgency?
[02:38:46.966 --> 02:38:49.569]  And people know I've never really gotten talk like this on air.
[02:38:49.589 --> 02:38:52.391]  I mean, I can feel it palpably right now.
[02:38:53.112 --> 02:38:53.713]  Palpably.
[02:38:55.194 --> 02:39:03.702]  The urgency and... Ted, what do you think about all this that is happening in the world right now?
[02:39:04.292 --> 02:39:05.872]  Well, I mean, everything's melting apart, Alex.
[02:39:05.932 --> 02:39:21.756]  I mean, right now, I mean, just yesterday, the Fed, along with, well, here it is, right here, the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, have all joined together to do this bailout thing that's going to be going on in Europe.
[02:39:22.376 --> 02:39:30.858]  Just the day before, the President is out there saying that the United States dollars are not going to be committed to fixing this problem, and here we have the problem being bailed out.
[02:39:31.118 --> 02:39:33.759]  This is like what happened in TARP, but it's on steroids.
[02:39:34.159 --> 02:39:41.585]  I mean, right now, back when TARP was being doled out, it was said to be $700 billion, but it turned out to be $7.77 trillion by the Fed underneath and under disguise without any, you know, any
[02:39:50.692 --> 02:39:51.833]  Any disclosure?
[02:39:52.454 --> 02:39:58.181]  These banks that were taking the money were in trouble, yet they were reporting that they're in great shape to their shareholders.
[02:39:58.241 --> 02:40:02.907]  So, you know, what they're trying to do is they're trying to stop a run on the banks, and this does.
[02:40:02.947 --> 02:40:07.272]  It totally sells our country and our sovereignty out.
[02:40:07.612 --> 02:40:10.576]  We are losing our liberty and we are turning it over.
[02:40:10.836 --> 02:40:18.618]  We are taking money directly out of the accounts of people's savings and so on and so forth through inflation and driving the value of the dollar down.
[02:40:19.078 --> 02:40:22.299]  And you're talking about World War III here.
[02:40:22.439 --> 02:40:25.540]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:37.464]  So why would anybody want to stay in a paper currency when they know the Fed is out there pumping new money into the system so they can lower interest rates and make it easier for these banks in Europe to trade?
[02:40:37.924 --> 02:40:42.627]  It's just absolutely a bailout, like we had in Wall Street here not too long ago.
[02:40:42.947 --> 02:40:47.650]  They're helping their buddies, but at the cost of the U.S.
[02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:48.351]  taxpayer.
[02:40:48.431 --> 02:40:50.372]  And it's devastating.
[02:40:50.392 --> 02:40:54.515]  And it's not only devastating here, it's devastating across the entire world.
[02:40:55.195 --> 02:40:59.018]  Mikhail Pokorov, a billionaire over in
[02:40:59.899 --> 02:41:06.426]  The Soviet Union was saying that it's safer to buy gold bars than it is to buy U.S.
[02:41:06.526 --> 02:41:07.106]  Treasuries.
[02:41:07.447 --> 02:41:08.828]  I mean, it's gotten down to that.
[02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:10.770]  People always went to U.S.
[02:41:10.850 --> 02:41:11.912]  Treasuries for safety.
[02:41:12.152 --> 02:41:12.512]  Always.
[02:41:12.752 --> 02:41:13.293]  Investments.
[02:41:13.353 --> 02:41:17.698]  If you're ever concerned about the economy, the United States Treasury was the place to go.
[02:41:18.198 --> 02:41:23.002]  Now we're sitting here and the billionaires across the world are saying, nope, we're going to gold.
[02:41:23.162 --> 02:41:29.366]  Gold bars and gold coins make a lot more sense than any other investment entirely in the world.
[02:41:29.426 --> 02:41:31.628]  So yeah, is it time to take advantage of it?
[02:41:31.668 --> 02:41:32.468]  Is it time to move?
[02:41:32.928 --> 02:41:33.589]  Absolutely!
[02:41:33.629 --> 02:41:34.249]  You can see it.
[02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:35.550]  The handwriting's on the wall.
[02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:38.893]  By the way, Ted, I want to invite you on the nightly news tonight.
[02:41:38.913 --> 02:41:39.953]  We've got Stuart Rhodes.
[02:41:40.954 --> 02:41:59.503]  Joining us, but I want to get you on to just to go over the history of inflation And to give some examples, but also you can dig up the articles and show people You know how big these bailouts are but yeah Obama yesterday was giving speeches saying there'll be no Federal Reserve US dollars Given to this and here's Bloomberg today.
[02:41:59.523 --> 02:42:00.384]  It was already happening.
[02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:04.606]  I mean, it's just the they take advantage of people's ignorance and
[02:42:05.626 --> 02:42:06.987]  People say, well, so what do they bail them out?
[02:42:07.748 --> 02:42:10.950]  It devalues the dollar and they're devaluing all the currencies.
[02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:12.391]  They have accelerated it.
[02:42:13.252 --> 02:42:16.535]  And most economists I talk to, they say within six months, you're going to really see it.
[02:42:17.115 --> 02:42:24.841]  And you talk to Salente, uh, you know, and he's saying, look, they're going to start grabbing more bank accounts, more stuff, MF Global.
[02:42:25.341 --> 02:42:27.963]  I mean, Ted, the MF Global thing is what's shaking me up.
[02:42:28.484 --> 02:42:33.628]  Cause I went back and studied some of the cases and I, you know, I had remembered what had happened, but I wanted to make sure I was right.
[02:42:34.867 --> 02:42:35.647]  I went back and looked at it.
[02:42:36.068 --> 02:42:49.113]  They've never had a Chicago mercantile big looting with a company bankruptcy with subsidiaries that took sequestered private accounts, segregated accounts.
[02:42:50.673 --> 02:42:51.774]  They've never had anything like this.
[02:42:52.394 --> 02:42:54.915]  Even when whole companies go under, they've paid people back.
[02:42:55.535 --> 02:42:56.976]  Now they're just saying we're not doing it.
[02:42:56.996 --> 02:42:59.077]  You know, maybe a few people or something.
[02:43:00.610 --> 02:43:06.358]  It's just so creepy to know that Corzine, the main advisor, is making 40-to-1 bets.
[02:43:06.898 --> 02:43:08.600]  That's proof these are madmen!
[02:43:09.722 --> 02:43:12.585]  It's so crazy Bob Chapman thinks it may be some setup where...
[02:43:13.823 --> 02:43:19.912]  He made the bad bet, and they got the money on the other side betting against, but we've looked at it and can't find those numbers.
[02:43:19.992 --> 02:43:30.246]  I mean, these are lunatics, Ted, and they've got a bought Senate with a bunch of political whores, most of them who have been, you know, caught sleeping with the pages, so they're all blackmailed.
[02:43:31.307 --> 02:43:34.268]  Who are up there saying, yeah, we're gonna arrest whoever we want and torture you.
[02:43:34.348 --> 02:43:41.930]  I mean, it's just, to be totally confirmed that we've been absolutely right and then some, Ted, it's disgusting.
[02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:43.191]  I feel like throwing up.
[02:43:43.691 --> 02:43:44.911]  I'm not happy that I'm right.
[02:43:45.251 --> 02:43:47.732]  I mean, I can't, Ted, I can't enjoy anything now.
[02:43:48.152 --> 02:43:49.873]  You know, I can't even go to movies now, Ted.
[02:43:49.973 --> 02:43:50.753]  I can't do anything.
[02:43:51.213 --> 02:43:52.193]  I can't do anything now.
[02:43:52.493 --> 02:43:57.495]  All I think about is this, Ted, and I can't even get people I know to realize how real this is.
[02:43:58.134 --> 02:44:01.875]  Well, they're going to be realizing how real it is when they're standing there in a breadline.
[02:44:01.915 --> 02:44:14.237]  I mean, right now, we're covering the bad bets of the New York banks and the big banks in Europe for lending all this money to these countries that shouldn't have had it in the first place.
[02:44:14.297 --> 02:44:15.638]  And guess who's getting bailed out?
[02:44:16.078 --> 02:44:17.078]  It's them.
[02:44:17.658 --> 02:44:19.398]  They're getting the money from us.
[02:44:19.838 --> 02:44:22.259]  They're taking it directly from us through inflation.
[02:44:22.279 --> 02:44:22.739]  They're printing
[02:44:22.879 --> 02:44:28.943]  But if that isn't enough, they then grandstand and lecture us when 90 plus percent of the debt is theirs!
[02:44:29.583 --> 02:44:31.084]  And that's exactly right, Alex.
[02:44:31.164 --> 02:44:32.665]  And they had a vote at the Fed.
[02:44:32.905 --> 02:44:39.269]  I mean, that's why Ron Paul wanted to have transparency of the Fed with their audits.
[02:44:39.329 --> 02:44:40.510]  We wouldn't even have known about this.
[02:44:40.530 --> 02:44:45.814]  Ted, what about these Republican mainline idiots that want Mitt Romney and Gingrich?
[02:44:45.874 --> 02:44:48.495]  I mean, they're as pathetic as Obama supporters.
[02:44:48.535 --> 02:44:49.396]  These are idiots!
[02:44:49.696 --> 02:44:50.876]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.
[02:44:50.896 --> 02:44:53.117]  The people of the United States are asleep.
[02:44:53.177 --> 02:44:56.337]  They have no idea what's happening to them.
[02:44:56.877 --> 02:45:03.099]  And if they were, if they were smart, you would see Ron Paul showing up a lot higher than 10, 12 percent.
[02:45:03.339 --> 02:45:07.159]  He'd be getting 25, 30, 40 percent on these polls.
[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:10.260]  Now maybe they're loaded, and maybe they're not completely true.
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:11.600]  We'll see what happens in Iowa.
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:14.061]  But I can tell you right now, if the people had
[02:45:14.921 --> 02:45:23.165]  Half the information, or half the knowledge that it took to understand what was going on, and it's not even that, it doesn't even take a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out.
[02:45:23.185 --> 02:45:24.585]  Oh, Jeff, this is all red level.
[02:45:24.685 --> 02:45:29.627]  I mean, this, I just, it just, everything keeps happening according to the globalist plan.
[02:45:30.288 --> 02:45:32.749]  It keeps getting, and then, and then you, this is what it is.
[02:45:33.369 --> 02:45:37.651]  We know we're about to enter the phase where all this horrible stuff's gonna look like good times.
[02:45:38.331 --> 02:45:42.093]  I mean, we're about to really get into the bad area.
[02:45:42.953 --> 02:45:47.499]  It's like you go to the doctor and they say, your heart is completely clogged up, you could have a heart attack anytime.
[02:45:47.759 --> 02:45:48.760]  You're like, oh, I'm fine.
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:52.144]  And a month later, you're walking up the stairs and the heart attack starts, you know?
[02:45:52.465 --> 02:45:54.006]  I mean, it's there, and it's sad.
[02:45:57.188 --> 02:45:58.028]  Alright, I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:45:58.048 --> 02:45:58.868]  I want to go to phone calls.
[02:45:58.908 --> 02:46:00.849]  Ted, give people the gold specials of the day.
[02:46:00.869 --> 02:46:02.549]  Again, you buy it when it's low.
[02:46:02.649 --> 02:46:05.930]  When it's high, as it is, gold and silver, you sell it at the old low price.
[02:46:06.310 --> 02:46:08.510]  The radio specials are incredible loss leaders.
[02:46:09.191 --> 02:46:10.991]  Briefly, give people the gold and silver specials.
[02:46:11.031 --> 02:46:19.573]  I hope they take advantage of it because I know you're a busy man to get a hold of, Ted, but I need to get a hold of you because it's time for me to get some gold and silver.
[02:46:19.613 --> 02:46:20.233]  I've got to do it.
[02:46:20.793 --> 02:46:23.594]  I can't even leave emergency money in the account to run this place.
[02:46:23.654 --> 02:46:24.574]  I can't even be trusted now.
[02:46:25.373 --> 02:46:30.519]  Well, first of all, gold did run up to $17.5210, and right now it's currently up $30.30.
[02:46:31.319 --> 02:46:34.903]  So it knows, the market knows, that the dollar is going to take a hit.
[02:46:35.144 --> 02:46:36.004]  It's reflecting that.
[02:46:36.285 --> 02:46:39.108]  Silver at $33.05 today, up $0.92.
[02:46:39.448 --> 02:46:42.952]  The things to be getting into right now are like the walking Liberty Half at $16.01.
[02:46:44.033 --> 02:46:50.234]  The Frank coin at $3.81 and get the four-year subscription to Bob's newsletter, The International Forecaster.
[02:46:50.654 --> 02:46:53.295]  And for God's sake, understand economics.
[02:46:53.615 --> 02:46:58.036]  Get that book and that video and those two silver dollars for $73.
[02:46:58.256 --> 02:47:05.277]  It's three silver dollars, the book and the video, and you're almost out of the Big Brother book, and then we're going to ship to some other special.
[02:47:05.677 --> 02:47:09.998]  So if folks want the three silver dollars and the free book, video and shipping, they need to call right now.
[02:47:10.418 --> 02:47:10.918]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:10.938 --> 02:47:17.383]  You again can get the frank at cost and then get a free subscription.
[02:47:18.584 --> 02:47:20.866]  $159 value of the International Forecaster as well.
[02:47:20.886 --> 02:47:24.069]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:26.751]  Tell folks about some of the other coin specials you've got, Ted.
[02:47:27.321 --> 02:47:30.562]  Well, I mean, obviously, one of the better coins to be getting into is the U.S.
[02:47:30.662 --> 02:47:31.682]  Eagle.
[02:47:32.222 --> 02:47:33.163]  It's at $1,908.29.
[02:47:33.683 --> 02:47:36.404]  I have a few of those Proof Campaign for Liberty still.
[02:47:36.484 --> 02:47:39.325]  Want to help Ron Paul a little bit?
[02:47:39.345 --> 02:47:40.885]  $523.73 makes an awful lot of sense.
[02:47:41.185 --> 02:47:45.947]  For those of you who don't have a whole lot of money, consider the copper coins I have up on the website now at $2.93.
[02:47:47.467 --> 02:47:48.428]  Uh, for a bag of 250.
[02:47:48.508 --> 02:47:51.651]  The Lakota Silver's at 4127.
[02:47:52.652 --> 02:47:55.575]  I think the bags of survival dimes at 2495.
[02:47:55.815 --> 02:47:57.857]  That's 1,000 dimes.
[02:47:57.897 --> 02:48:03.562]  You realize it takes 24 dimes to buy, uh, one new, uh, to buy one of the old.
[02:48:03.602 --> 02:48:07.086]  That's the, that's the, uh, equation right now if you want to transfer one to the other.
[02:48:07.466 --> 02:48:09.047]  That's going to widen.
[02:48:09.768 --> 02:48:10.729]  It's just simply this.
[02:48:11.029 --> 02:48:14.872]  Gold and silver is a reflection of what really is happening on in the economy.
[02:48:15.273 --> 02:48:20.997]  And as the Fed steps in and turns on their printing press to do all this bailout, you're going to see gold and silver rise.
[02:48:21.077 --> 02:48:23.239]  And it's just the way it is.
[02:48:23.579 --> 02:48:24.861]  Absolutely.
[02:48:24.881 --> 02:48:25.441]  Ted, 800-686-2237.
[02:48:25.881 --> 02:48:30.685]  And we've got Stuart Rose on the night about the indefinite detention, torture, and the rest of it on the Nightly News.
[02:48:30.725 --> 02:48:33.548]  But I want to get you on, so I'll talk to you after the show, okay?
[02:48:34.008 --> 02:48:34.848]  Yep, sounds good.
[02:48:34.868 --> 02:48:35.108]  Thank you.
[02:48:35.128 --> 02:48:39.129]  There goes Ted Anderson, InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock central tonight.
[02:48:39.949 --> 02:48:40.829]  I want to go to your calls.
[02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:42.449]  It's a lot to do a bit of overdrive.
[02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:45.050]  I'm going to come back and go to your calls here in the next segment.
[02:48:46.090 --> 02:48:47.530]  I see these articles all the time.
[02:48:48.871 --> 02:48:52.451]  Where another foreclosure fraud whistleblower found dead, MSNBC.
[02:48:54.912 --> 02:49:02.873]  And it says a notary public who signed tens of thousands of false documents at a massive foreclosure scan before blowing the whistle on the scandal has been found dead in her Las Vegas home.
[02:49:04.754 --> 02:49:10.717]  She was scheduled to be sentenced Monday morning, and she pled guilty last month, notarizing the signature of an individual not in her presence.
[02:49:10.757 --> 02:49:15.059]  She failed to show up for a hearing, but police found her dead at the home later.
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:22.282]  And they can't, of course, determine what happened, but they've killed so many Pentagon investigators.
[02:49:22.782 --> 02:49:30.806]  Look, the green light's been given for criminals to run wild in America, as long as it's under mafia dons, government and corporate mafia dons.
[02:49:32.106 --> 02:49:34.667]  And it's just open season with the gullible public.
[02:49:34.707 --> 02:49:37.007]  I feel so sorry for them.
[02:49:37.647 --> 02:49:44.649]  They've been taught for 60 years in this country, any criticism of government, not loving and trusting government, is a conspiracy theory.
[02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:49.790]  Of course, it's pure Americana, pure George Washington, to not trust a government, to keep government small.
[02:49:50.571 --> 02:49:54.031]  Now, they're starting to wake up, but they're still very childlike.
[02:49:54.732 --> 02:49:59.953]  I mean, I hear people on talk radio, I talk to them in the streets, and they are so childlike.
[02:50:01.206 --> 02:50:03.687]  They're friendly, they're sweet, they're goofy.
[02:50:04.307 --> 02:50:06.288]  They have no idea.
[02:50:07.228 --> 02:50:13.791]  We, in this country, used to be hardcore, you know, rugged individualists on average.
[02:50:14.831 --> 02:50:18.853]  People didn't care about what happened.
[02:50:18.913 --> 02:50:20.514]  If you messed with them, they'd come after you.
[02:50:22.254 --> 02:50:26.816]  I mean, I've read the old letters and family bibles and stuff of my ancestors on both sides.
[02:50:26.856 --> 02:50:29.157]  I mean, and they were just standard people.
[02:50:30.128 --> 02:50:31.848]  And they weren't going around looking for trouble either.
[02:50:31.868 --> 02:50:34.469]  They were church attending, hard-working people.
[02:50:34.809 --> 02:50:37.890]  But you mess with them, they'd kill you so fast it'd make your head spin.
[02:50:38.490 --> 02:50:39.831]  You cheated them out of a nickel.
[02:50:40.491 --> 02:50:41.571]  You're gonna get your head beat in.
[02:50:42.131 --> 02:50:45.192]  And we now are just a country that just takes everything.
[02:50:46.933 --> 02:50:49.893]  People always make fun of folks in the South and the West for being so polite.
[02:50:50.734 --> 02:50:53.454]  People are polite because if you weren't polite, you'd end up dead.
[02:50:54.015 --> 02:50:54.735]  We'll be right back.

[02:54:00.510 --> 02:54:09.254]  Okay, I recognize the name Law from Colorado.
[02:54:29.302 --> 02:54:39.289]  And I met him, he's a big ol' giant guy, who I got, uh, uh, uh, uh, Luke Hradowski got up on his shoulders when the MSNBC cut my bullhorn cord when I was out in public.
[02:54:39.309 --> 02:54:41.711]  So you can see that is what the extra in the Obama deception.
[02:54:42.171 --> 02:54:45.233]  It's also online, just type in MSNBC attacks Alex Jones.
[02:54:45.914 --> 02:54:55.320]  And I heard he's got some breaking news, uh, cause, uh, they actually separately emailed Dew, and Dew just came in here and told me, hey, they say they're on hold, and they've got some breaking news, I guess it's of a...
[02:54:56.281 --> 02:55:03.166]  of a Syracuse type or a Satanic Valley type with Penn State.
[02:55:03.947 --> 02:55:05.508]  Law, good to hear from you.
[02:55:05.588 --> 02:55:06.449]  What's the information?
[02:55:07.509 --> 02:55:08.290]  How you doing Alex?
[02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:09.111]  Great to hear you.
[02:55:10.111 --> 02:55:13.174]  Wow, this is some pretty amazing information.
[02:55:13.434 --> 02:55:23.822]  I don't know if you've heard about the Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan was arrested yesterday involved in this methamphetamine and child sex ring.
[02:55:25.482 --> 02:55:30.225]  John Elinoff, who I know you know, actually is the guy who broke this thing.
[02:55:30.385 --> 02:55:32.906]  He's been spending several weeks working on this.
[02:55:32.946 --> 02:55:37.048]  He's been like hiding for his life and stuff, because this is really serious stuff.
[02:55:37.088 --> 02:55:38.168]  No, I know Elinoff well.
[02:55:38.488 --> 02:55:42.810]  I've hung out with him and others, and of course you there in Colorado a few times.
[02:55:43.050 --> 02:55:45.832]  Great activist there, and we were there covering the DNC in 08.
[02:55:46.232 --> 02:55:46.692]  We were there.
[02:55:47.613 --> 02:55:48.753]  This is in the news?
[02:55:49.113 --> 02:55:50.514]  Another nest of these people?
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:53.681]  Yeah, this is really kind of amazing stuff.
[02:55:53.701 --> 02:55:55.961]  There have been several arrests.
[02:55:56.442 --> 02:55:59.062]  The news is not really coming clear on who it is.
[02:55:59.082 --> 02:56:03.404]  Yeah, they generally arrest to cover up the full network, yeah.
[02:56:03.424 --> 02:56:05.404]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[02:56:05.464 --> 02:56:08.305]  Well, I can definitely tell you this is a large ring.
[02:56:08.625 --> 02:56:11.706]  It definitely involves more than just the Sheriff's Department.
[02:56:11.726 --> 02:56:14.107]  There are several police departments, sheriff's departments.
[02:56:14.847 --> 02:56:20.729]  I could probably go as far as to say, Alex, this may involve the CIA, the FBI, the military.
[02:56:21.269 --> 02:56:25.171]  It's kind of conspiracy of silence stuff all over again.
[02:56:25.872 --> 02:56:31.475]  Dyncor is the biggest CPS contractor grabbing kids nationwide and they run public slave rings worldwide.
[02:56:31.915 --> 02:56:34.156]  I mean it's just unbelievable how evil these people are.
[02:56:34.676 --> 02:56:37.498]  So I type in Arapahoe County, Colorado.
[02:56:38.362 --> 02:56:40.265]  Yeah, you probably could.
[02:56:40.585 --> 02:56:45.233]  The guy's name was Pat Sullivan, and he's like a really honored sheriff.
[02:56:45.433 --> 02:56:51.222]  This guy has this stellar record, and this guy is definitely involved in this major stuff.
[02:56:53.593 --> 02:56:55.734]  Okay, yeah, I've just been given a news article.
[02:56:55.754 --> 02:56:57.514]  There's so many pedophile rings, I gotta keep track of it.
[02:56:57.795 --> 02:57:00.235]  Now, now, I know you say you guys were involved in investigating this.
[02:57:00.516 --> 02:57:07.098]  A lot of times they also sting good people and set them up for this, but I'm not saying that's not the... I mean, you guys are the ones on the ground.
[02:57:07.418 --> 02:57:10.019]  Former Arapaho Sheriff arrested on meth-dealing charge.
[02:57:10.399 --> 02:57:12.640]  And are you saying it's in the news here about the kids?
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:16.583]  Um, you know, they're not talking about like underage kids.
[02:57:16.623 --> 02:57:20.807]  They're kind of playing it off as like he was trading methamphetamines for sex.
[02:57:21.588 --> 02:57:22.789]  Oh yeah, that's what it says.
[02:57:22.889 --> 02:57:33.139]  It says, yeah, former Arapahoe County Sheriff Patrick Sullivan was arrested on suspicion of trying to trade drugs to a man for sex as investigators monitored the deal.
[02:57:34.062 --> 02:57:35.244]  Yeah, and that's how they'll do it.
[02:57:35.445 --> 02:57:38.670]  We've seen that with the Boys Town and all that.
[02:57:39.351 --> 02:57:43.659]  They'll bust one person to cover it up and then kind of minimize what's going on.
[02:57:43.679 --> 02:57:46.684]  But you're saying Elinoff was the one who actually got this going?
[02:57:47.346 --> 02:57:50.067]  I know, I've been in Tom's studio, but I need to get Martino on then about this Elanoffson hiding.
[02:58:15.458 --> 02:58:20.620]  Says this shows that no one is above the law, but you're saying, Elenov is saying from his research, it's much bigger.
[02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:22.141]  Much bigger.
[02:58:22.461 --> 02:58:25.322]  The things we know, I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:58:25.782 --> 02:58:32.044]  How big it is, we're not necessarily sure, but, you know, this kind of goes back to something you had said a few episodes ago.
[02:58:32.064 --> 02:58:33.025]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:58:33.045 --> 02:58:34.425]  Stay there for the main radio audience.
[02:58:34.465 --> 02:58:35.566]  See you tomorrow and back tonight.

[02:59:19.152 --> 02:59:20.073]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:20.653 --> 02:59:27.534]  All the seeds in the Survival Seed Bank go through strict germination testing so you can be confident you're not buying old seeds.

[02:59:32.516 --> 02:59:34.236]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[02:59:47.119 --> 02:59:49.981]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:50.701 --> 02:59:54.803]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.766 --> 03:00:02.848]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[03:00:05.329 --> 03:00:09.352]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:09.772 --> 03:00:14.775]  Okay, look, I want to get to all the other callers.
[03:00:16.832 --> 03:00:25.382]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.642 --> 03:00:30.407]  Alright, finishing up with Law in Colorado.
[03:00:31.248 --> 03:00:33.010]  You were saying something as we went to break, Law.
[03:00:33.030 --> 03:00:33.330]  Go ahead.
[03:00:34.068 --> 03:00:50.457]  Yeah, this reminds me of something you had mentioned, I don't know, a few weeks past about how these NWO guys will, you know, sacrifice some of their own people in order to make the rest of their people kind of toe the line because something big may be coming down.
[03:00:50.798 --> 03:00:55.100]  And I really suspect that that may be what's going on.
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:01:01.764]  Yeah, I know, they will bust a bunch of these rings and people to scare the rest of them and say, see what we can do?
[03:01:03.168 --> 03:01:04.269]  I mean, that's who the globalists want.
[03:01:04.289 --> 03:01:05.970]  They want someone who can be compromised.
[03:01:06.530 --> 03:01:07.691]  They want you to become corrupt.
[03:01:07.711 --> 03:01:08.411]  It's like Serpico.
[03:01:08.431 --> 03:01:10.712]  They kept trying to get him to take jewelry and stuff.
[03:01:10.752 --> 03:01:12.113]  Come on, just make us feel good.
[03:01:12.493 --> 03:01:13.454]  Be part of it with us.
[03:01:14.991 --> 03:01:15.892]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:01:15.952 --> 03:01:17.593]  I mean, this may be a big thing.
[03:01:17.633 --> 03:01:19.394]  I'm not sure how far it goes.
[03:01:19.915 --> 03:01:22.576]  You may want to try and get John on your show.
[03:01:22.596 --> 03:01:25.479]  I mean, he's just up to his eyeballs on this stuff.
[03:01:25.519 --> 03:01:28.020]  And like I say, he's been hiding out for his life.
[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:29.581]  He's been threatened with guns.
[03:01:29.602 --> 03:01:30.602]  He's had all kinds of stuff.
[03:01:30.662 --> 03:01:31.903]  And I mean, this guy's a trooper.
[03:01:32.323 --> 03:01:34.205]  He kept on sticking with it, sticking with it.
[03:01:34.345 --> 03:01:36.707]  And really, this is really amazing stuff.
[03:01:37.608 --> 03:01:46.576]  Well, it's saying informants were involved and stuff because the deputies were in a police call and they saw the sheriff there and thought it was weird and that started the investigation.
[03:01:46.956 --> 03:01:48.257]  You're saying that's not what happened?
[03:01:48.277 --> 03:01:49.598]  That Elinoff was involved?
[03:01:50.699 --> 03:01:51.460]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:54.443]  Elinoff really brought this whole thing forward.
[03:01:54.743 --> 03:01:58.046]  I mean, he's the main guy that really made this stuff happen.
[03:01:58.106 --> 03:02:00.448]  So, I mean, that guy is a truther through and through, man.
[03:02:01.263 --> 03:02:02.664]  All right, we'll have to talk to him.
[03:02:02.684 --> 03:02:06.448]  I had your number before, Law, but let me put you on hold and make sure I have that.
[03:02:06.909 --> 03:02:07.289]  Thank you.
[03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:08.610]  And then we'll try to get a hold of him.
[03:02:09.311 --> 03:02:09.611]  Thank you.
[03:02:09.651 --> 03:02:10.892]  Just amazing information.
[03:02:11.233 --> 03:02:12.854]  Let's go ahead and jam in some more here.
[03:02:13.615 --> 03:02:14.716]  Glenn in Canada.
[03:02:14.736 --> 03:02:15.417]  You're on the air.
[03:02:15.477 --> 03:02:15.817]  Welcome.
[03:02:17.299 --> 03:02:17.459]  Hi.
[03:02:17.479 --> 03:02:18.199]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:19.581]  Thanks very much for taking my call.
[03:02:19.981 --> 03:02:20.261]  Thank you.
[03:02:20.301 --> 03:02:20.602]  Go ahead.
[03:02:22.151 --> 03:02:47.222]  Um, just, uh, I'm a former math, physics, and calculus teacher, and when I was young I was told that history was written by the victors, so I chose not to study any history, uh, thinking that it might be skewed, but, uh, you opened up my eyes to history, uh, within the last, uh, two years, and I started trying to teach people what you taught me, and people would place me in a category, uh, of being a ranter.
[03:02:48.504 --> 03:02:52.932]  Oh no, pretty soon if you know how to tie your shoelaces, you're a conspiracy theorist thought criminal.
[03:02:53.873 --> 03:02:59.103]  Yeah, well up in politically correct Canada, which is the politically correct capital of the universe I think,
[03:03:01.816 --> 03:03:06.117]  Anything that's not status quo, you're called a rancher, and that's a very bad thing.
[03:03:06.157 --> 03:03:16.320]  But something, an antidote that I got that I just wanted to share with you, because it might help you, and you may have heard of it because you're so well-studied, but it's a quote by Jiddu Krishnamurti.
[03:03:16.340 --> 03:03:17.020]  You ever hear of him?
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:18.641]  I've heard the name, yes.
[03:03:19.621 --> 03:03:24.242]  Yeah, it says, it is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.
[03:03:26.403 --> 03:03:29.223]  Well, yeah, I mean, obviously, it's just a thin
[03:03:31.348 --> 03:03:36.811]  Cliched stereotype to say, hey, I don't trust the government that's been caught lying thousands of times.
[03:03:36.831 --> 03:03:40.533]  They're like, how ridiculous, you're crazy.
[03:03:40.553 --> 03:03:42.594]  I mean, it's a joke.
[03:03:43.575 --> 03:03:46.497]  And I personally, those people don't even matter.
[03:03:46.537 --> 03:03:47.957]  Just move on to those that do.
[03:03:47.977 --> 03:03:50.499]  I mean, people get kind of get insulted when some.
[03:03:52.022 --> 03:03:52.562]  It's time.
[03:04:15.263 --> 03:04:16.984]  Um, hey, I'm 15 miles from you.
[03:04:17.004 --> 03:04:18.705]  There's a town called San Juan Bautista.
[03:04:18.766 --> 03:04:21.527]  It's run by a sheriff from, uh, Texas.
[03:04:21.627 --> 03:04:26.811]  And, uh, under his nose, there were under more than 50 metlap houses.
[03:04:27.231 --> 03:04:28.372]  And this town is probably 1,500.
[03:04:28.512 --> 03:04:34.436]  It's a little mission town, where the president really did his stating to the native sense.
[03:04:35.056 --> 03:04:43.682]  So, um, the guy who let Obama out onto the stage to be sworn in is, um, more the person behind
[03:04:44.577 --> 03:04:48.720]  The corruption, as far as preventing the war... And who let him out?
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:49.380]  I forget.
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:50.581]  Who let him out?
[03:04:50.641 --> 03:04:51.062]  I forget.
[03:04:51.082 --> 03:04:53.703]  Um, he's a little guy.
[03:04:53.723 --> 03:04:55.725]  He's like, um, Murdoch.
[03:04:56.245 --> 03:04:57.206]  Oh, we won't be able to hear him.
