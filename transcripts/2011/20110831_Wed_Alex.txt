[00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:06.193]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:07.975]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.736]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.858]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:17.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.164]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:40.827]  It is Wednesday, the 31st day of August 2011, and we are going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.827 --> 00:00:50.851]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer will be joining us to give us his breakdown on what he thinks is happening in Libya and Syria coming up in about 30 minutes from now.
[00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:58.516]  And then the one, the only, Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:06.321]  That could be fluid with all the things going on in Congress, but he's scheduled coming up in T-minus one and a half hours from now.
[00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:17.714]  We're also going to be opening the phones up during the entire third hour of the broadcast today and off and on in the first two hours.
[00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:22.798]  Obviously, we have a huge amount of news and information to cover here.
[00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:28.304]  I think the most important thing I'm going to probably get into today, well, really two big issues.
[00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:34.892]  Well, maybe three issues.
[00:01:34.892 --> 00:01:36.612]  I was sitting here before I went live.
[00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:38.273]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:45.775]  getting ready for this radio show today, trying to grasp what's unfolding.
[00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:51.257]  The Congressional Black Caucus has come out and said Tea Partiers are racist that want to lynch black people.
[00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:52.177]  That's an actual quote.
[00:01:53.504 --> 00:02:01.046]  Invoking racial division and race war and branding the Tea Party and the ideas of the Tea Party as racist.
[00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.047]  So, absolute poison pill.
[00:02:03.047 --> 00:02:10.209]  It's like Al Gore saying, if you don't support paying carbon taxes to him, you're a racist.
[00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.031]  That it's akin to supporting racism to not support paying carbon taxes.
[00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:18.855]  Al Gore, Barack Obama, Lord Rothschild, and others.
[00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.916]  So it's more divide and conquer.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:25.677]  See, that's one reason we can't have more immigrants come to this country.
[00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:27.457]  I mean, they're here, they're coming.
[00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:33.038]  The most open country in the world is because when they get here, they're not taught about the American dream.
[00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:41.101]  They're taught about division and balkanization by the government and the dinosaur corporate whore media so that they can then play us off against each other.
[00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:42.021]  That's the issue.
[00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:47.475]  That's the problem all over the country in Arizona, Texas, California.
[00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:55.478]  School children, in most cases who are Hispanic, cannot wear, in one case in San Francisco, an old Navy shirt that has an American flag on it.
[00:02:55.478 --> 00:03:01.181]  Old glory absolutely is seen by the illegal aliens as an enemy.
[00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.442]  And I've asked Hispanics to call in on the show and I've said, is this not true?
[00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:09.484]  They've called in and said, no, there's a large portion of people from Mexico that don't even want to see the American flag.
[00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:10.865]  But I'm supposed to go, oh, great.
[00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:21.494]  Let's just adopt all the policies of Mexico and that narco-terrorist state, and let's bring in more people who see the American flag and go into convulsions.
[00:03:21.494 --> 00:03:28.360]  Now, again, that's not most Hispanic Americans, incredibly smart, hard-working, patriotic people.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.884]  But that's the real world of what's taught in Mexican schools, what's taught in U.S.
[00:03:32.884 --> 00:03:35.266]  universities, what I was taught at Anderson High School.
[00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:43.443]  By my art class and my history class teacher, who by the way were as white as the driven snow.
[00:03:43.443 --> 00:03:46.464]  This is all part of this culture of everybody fighting with each other.
[00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:54.867]  So Tea Party says let's cut taxes, cut government, let's restore the Constitution, Bill of Rights, the real Tea Party under Ron Paul.
[00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:58.868]  And I've watched them for almost four years on MSNBC say it's racist.
[00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:00.990]  And then you don't like government-run health care.
[00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.112]  You're racist.
[00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:06.197]  And they just invoke this stuff because, ladies and gentlemen, it works.
[00:04:06.197 --> 00:04:10.883]  To people that are kind of halfway listening, oh man, that guy was talking about getting rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.126]  That's code for wanting to lynch black people.
[00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:23.382]  It doesn't make any sense when you're conscious and paying attention, but when you're just kind of halfway listening, this is what the social engineers are counting on.
[00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:25.204]  We have that news.
[00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:27.926]  Also, top NASA climate scientist arrested at the White House.
[00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:31.148]  He's the same guy that endorses a book calling for a post-industrial...
[00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:35.625]  United States, the head of the Goddard Space Center.
[00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:42.407]  The big news, you want to actually save children and women and talk about Hispanics.
[00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:47.248]  There's a major eugenics operation that's being launched against Mexicans.
[00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:49.888]  I'm going to tell you about that when we come back.
[00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:54.710]  If you actually want to save people, period, you better listen.
[00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.350]  When we come back, stay with us.
[00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:04.659]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:05.580]  Number one.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.004]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:09.865]  Number two.
[00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:14.751]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:15.512]  It's true.
[00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:17.454]  Total government control of electricity.
[00:05:17.594 --> 00:05:20.356]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:21.196]  Number three.
[00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.778]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:28.701]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:29.481]  Number four.
[00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:32.243]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:35.925]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:36.726]  Number five.
[00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:40.868]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:45.631]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.182]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:12.182 --> 00:06:14.023]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[00:06:57.557 --> 00:06:58.438]  Others don't.
[00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:05.073]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:08.996]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:11.398]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:17.102]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:23.327]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:29.731]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:33.934]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:38.217]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.217 --> 00:07:44.162]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:47.724]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:49.705]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:50.126]  It's here.

[00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:05.724]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:08.006]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:19.093]  Yeah.
[00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:51.363]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to join us to talk about the economy, the election, the attacks that he's under because he's been criticizing the fact that FEMA is in control of every emergency situation in the United States that is not their federal role.
[00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:53.425]  We'll talk about Rick Perry.
[00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:55.506]  It's now emerged, something I didn't even know.
[00:08:55.506 --> 00:08:57.148]  I thought I knew about everything with Rick Perry.
[00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:04.679]  Not only is Rick Perry, the former chief of staff in Texas, for the presidential campaign the first time around in 88...
[00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:34.846]  For Al Gore, not only is he a man who wants to give forced inoculations of a vaccine known to kill and maim people that no other country in the world, uh, you know, basically will accept, not until now, I'm getting to that in a moment, not only did he hand over our roads or attempt to hand over 8,000 miles of our roads, he was successful with some of them to a foreign Spanish slash Australian company to, uh, basically loot, uh, the public's pocketbook to use existing roads
[00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:48.491]  Not only did he go to Bilderberg Group meeting, not only did he pledge to not run and then break that pledge as we told you he would, he is now reportedly the frontrunner, we're being told, with Ron Paul right behind him.
[00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:55.374]  No doubt he would be the admitted leader of the Republican PAC if the establishment wasn't running the psyop that he can't win.
[00:09:55.994 --> 00:09:59.457]  Now it has come out, and Rick Perry is defending it.
[00:09:59.457 --> 00:10:00.617]  Very proud of it.
[00:10:00.617 --> 00:10:03.359]  Rick Perry camp defends 1993.
[00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:08.583]  That's three years after he switched to Republican, supporting Hillarycare.
[00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:20.912]  And the letter and the public statements have now been dug out of him praising Hillarycare, when almost every Republican in the nation was violently opposed to socialist single-payer takeover.
[00:10:21.752 --> 00:10:28.215]  Of the healthcare system in this country to a national healthcare British-style service.
[00:10:28.215 --> 00:10:38.540]  Her proposal was even worse than the Obamacare, which is really, admittedly, the Massachusetts plan engineered by Mitt Romney.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.781]  So, the two supposed main frontrunners, we're told.
[00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:43.782]  Ron Paul's number three, but they always ignore him.
[00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:46.964]  Many polls, number one or number two, but he's undoubtedly number three.
[00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:54.247]  In the race, an incredible move from where he was three and a half years ago.
[00:10:54.247 --> 00:10:56.588]  Could be the president, but they run this mantra.
[00:10:56.588 --> 00:11:01.070]  Even when he was on Cavuto yesterday, Cavuto said, oh, I really love you, but too bad you can't win.
[00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.991]  Too bad you can't win.
[00:11:01.991 --> 00:11:04.412]  He just kept saying that and giggling.
[00:11:04.412 --> 00:11:10.235]  I mean, right there, just slapping Ron Paul upside the face while smiling while he did it.
[00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.382]  And just look at Mitt Romney.
[00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:15.603]  Just look at Rick Perry.
[00:11:15.603 --> 00:11:20.265]  I mean, I've got to say, I don't like Mitt Romney, but he is better than Rick Perry.
[00:11:20.265 --> 00:11:29.549]  Rick Perry is a political chameleon who makes Slick Willie look like a amateur.
[00:11:29.549 --> 00:11:37.052]  And people deserve what they get if they belly up to the bar, just like they did with Obama, and go with the establishment golden person.
[00:11:37.472 --> 00:11:39.394]  And that is what Rick Perry is.
[00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:40.555]  He is the golden boy.
[00:11:40.555 --> 00:11:44.759]  And they are putting him out there saying he's the second coming of Ronald Reagan.
[00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:45.680]  Everybody better look out.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.163]  We'll talk about that with Ron Paul coming up.
[00:11:49.163 --> 00:11:54.848]  And Rick Perry and Romney are trading barbs at each other, calling each other career politicians.
[00:11:55.589 --> 00:12:01.374]  Well, it wouldn't even be an issue if you're a politician who was a statesman and done a good job and stood up for the Constitution.
[00:12:01.374 --> 00:12:02.315]  There's very few of those.
[00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:04.977]  Of course, Ron Paul is not a career politician.
[00:12:04.977 --> 00:12:17.387]  He was a successful family practice doctor and also a person who, a medical doctor who attended to the birthing of babies.
[00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:17.588]  But
[00:12:18.992 --> 00:12:26.063]  These guys, it's not just that they're career politicians, it is that they are super uber establishment types.
[00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.612]  So we're gonna be going over that report today.
[00:12:30.612 --> 00:12:40.517]  Also, Paul Watson is set to have his report filed, a report we worked on together this morning.
[00:12:40.517 --> 00:12:53.303]  He is set to have this file in the next 10 minutes, so when I come back in the next break, I can get into this, because it affects so many facets of society and is a true illustration
[00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:57.509]  of just how corrupt the system has gotten.
[00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:03.893]  Report on man who faces life sentence for recording cops.
[00:13:03.893 --> 00:13:11.638]  That's Kurt Nemo's headline about it, but we have the newscast that we're going to be playing a clip from.
[00:13:11.638 --> 00:13:17.001]  And in the report, the reporter says, yes, it is illegal to film police in public.
[00:13:17.001 --> 00:13:19.082]  And this man is facing 70 plus years
[00:13:21.983 --> 00:13:28.226]  A total of 75 years in prison for videotaping the police.
[00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:43.452]  And Kurt's report is good, in fact it's excellent, but Watson's report that I worked with him on this morning, that's coming to the pages of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com in the next 5 to 10 minutes, deals with the fact that this is a hoax.
[00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:49.749]  And it illustrates how we have a government for and by hoaxing.
[00:13:49.749 --> 00:14:07.062]  Everything is more and more shifting into a just brazen hoaxes because the more bold something is, the more wild and insane it is, the more people have trouble dealing with it and basically processing it.
[00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:10.924]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[00:14:10.924 --> 00:14:13.105]  In fact, I forgot to ask the guys with the video list.
[00:14:13.105 --> 00:14:23.330]  You guys do have that news report on the man facing 70-plus years in prison for videotaping the police in public.
[00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.131]  We do have that?
[00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:27.432]  Yeah, I sent it a bunch.
[00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:29.913]  Okay, well, we'll get that.
[00:14:29.913 --> 00:14:30.694]  Okay, we do.
[00:14:30.694 --> 00:14:31.534]  We do have that report.
[00:14:31.534 --> 00:14:31.734]  Okay.
[00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.531]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:46.593]  So we're going to be covering that and analyzing the propaganda.
[00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:53.976]  Now, the next story is our top story.
[00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:57.157]  And I want people to listen to me very carefully.
[00:14:57.157 --> 00:15:00.859]  I know that a lot of folks listen to talk radio as kind of background chatter.
[00:15:01.974 --> 00:15:12.000]  But I want you to stop what you're doing if you can, and I want you to listen to me very, very, very carefully.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:22.547]  Because we're dealing with the lives and the health and the reproductive futures of tens of millions of people.
[00:15:24.582 --> 00:15:36.502]  And if you are Hispanic, particularly, and have family in Mexico, you absolutely must contact them and must warn them.
[00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:43.380]  You must do everything you can to reach out to them.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.562]  I'm not just here on air saying this.
[00:15:46.562 --> 00:15:50.905]  We have written probably more than a hundred news articles about this.
[00:15:50.905 --> 00:15:58.190]  I have interviewed, it's got to be more than 20 medical doctors, scientists, endocrinologists,
[00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:08.094]  You name it, on this subject alone in the last five years since 2006.
[00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:15.258]  So I'm begging you to listen to me.
[00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:19.600]  This is a life and death situation.
[00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:30.994]  Modern armies do not generally attack unless it's a nation being taken down with military force.
[00:16:30.994 --> 00:16:34.657]  The globalists, most of their operations are carried on by stealth.
[00:16:34.657 --> 00:16:36.859]  Sodium fluoride in the water.
[00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:40.462]  Radioactive isotopes mined out of the same phosphate limestone.
[00:16:40.462 --> 00:16:44.105]  Put in water supplies in 71% of the United States.
[00:16:44.105 --> 00:16:45.666]  On record.
[00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:48.668]  That's now mainstream news, but they just report it like it's no big deal.
[00:16:49.514 --> 00:17:00.238]  GMO crops with added genetic traits that produce chemicals and different hormones to reduce fertility, cause cancer, organ failure.
[00:17:00.238 --> 00:17:00.939]  Don't believe me?
[00:17:00.939 --> 00:17:05.540]  Genetically modified crops linked to cancer, organ failure, reduce fertility.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:14.884]  Bisphenol A, proven to do it, knowingly put in most plastics and in most printer ink, newspapers, printouts at your office, receipts.
[00:17:14.884 --> 00:17:17.285]  We are all under attack.
[00:17:17.285 --> 00:17:19.026]  Now listen to me carefully.
[00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:23.066]  Well, I'm about to get to the new news.
[00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:36.171]  You remember how every month or so, you hear in just the back of the newspaper, sit in the back of the newspaper, kind of hear it on the television while you're cooking dinner, that the U.S.
[00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:38.031]  apologizes or the U.N.
[00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:44.313]  apologizes for accidentally shooting kids up with live polio vaccine and killing and maiming a bunch of them.
[00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:45.994]  Every major country in the world.
[00:17:45.994 --> 00:17:48.355]  But they operate in third world nations where they can get away with it.
[00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:59.079]  Pakistan, Nigeria, Paraguay, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Peru.
[00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.421]  You constantly see it.
[00:18:01.421 --> 00:18:07.467]  And then they have big medical firms do the test and say, oh yes, this was added to the vaccine.
[00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:11.010]  It has come out over and over and over again.
[00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.232]  Giving prisoners, giving children syphilis.
[00:18:14.062 --> 00:18:15.843]  Telling him it's another vaccine.
[00:18:15.843 --> 00:18:17.484]  These people have been caught doing this.
[00:18:17.484 --> 00:18:22.007]  I want you to listen to me carefully.
[00:18:22.007 --> 00:18:29.252]  The Gardasil vaccine is a modified live cancer virus.
[00:18:29.252 --> 00:18:39.399]  The insert for it only says that it covers six of the thousands of different human papillomaviruses.
[00:18:39.399 --> 00:18:42.161]  It's one of the most rare forms of fatal cancer.
[00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:44.247]  Cervical cancer.
[00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:49.429]  Very rare, normally in debilitated people.
[00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:53.872]  In the trials in 2006, there were many deaths.
[00:18:53.872 --> 00:18:55.973]  Just type trials of Gardasil deaths.
[00:18:55.973 --> 00:18:59.435]  You'll get mainstream news, mainstream medical reports.
[00:18:59.435 --> 00:19:03.317]  Other countries did trials and then said you can't release this to the public.
[00:19:03.317 --> 00:19:07.219]  Rick Perry said it's mandated to be on the list of quote
[00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:11.410]  Vaccines that you have to have to attend school, that's a hoax too.
[00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.471]  You don't have to take them.
[00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:15.633]  They just lie to you and say you do.
[00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:18.536]  You have to force it and say, I know you're lying, give me the waiver.
[00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:20.637]  But there's not even a law, you've got to do the waiver.
[00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:22.559]  That will just prove to you they're lying to you.
[00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.520]  Then say, show me the law, I've got to do the waiver.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.581]  There's layers of the hoax.
[00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:31.005]  When you find out about one layer, there's another layer, like an onion.
[00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:33.847]  Now, since this was approved all over the world,
[00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:47.718]  In the few countries around the world where it's been approved, there has been massive autoimmune responses, organ failure, death, blood coming out of every orifice.
[00:19:47.718 --> 00:19:55.646]  Mexico has announced they're going to vaccinate every little girl in Mexico with this.
[00:19:55.646 --> 00:19:57.808]  We've got to get the word out.
[00:19:57.808 --> 00:19:58.949]  We've got to save these people.
[00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:04.296]  HempUSA.org brings you pure camembert powder.

[00:20:30.852 --> 00:20:35.415]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:41.219]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.219 --> 00:20:44.861]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:22:13.336 --> 00:22:14.417]  No one can deny.
[00:22:14.577 --> 00:22:25.302]  That our media operation is the tip of the spear, and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to intensify our operations against the globalists 110%.
[00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:30.324]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:22:30.324 --> 00:22:32.605]  The social network is nearing completion as well.

[00:22:53.134 --> 00:22:58.696]  It is up to us, the InfoWarriors, to take the initiative and to defeat the globalists.
[00:22:59.915 --> 00:23:02.478]  How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
[00:23:26.252 --> 00:23:26.653]  Yeah.
[00:23:38.883 --> 00:23:52.490]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:58.673]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas now available at Amazon.com
[00:24:05.752 --> 00:24:18.286]  Now, we know the system has backdoored sterilant cancer triggers into most of the major GMO crops.
[00:24:18.286 --> 00:24:21.169]  Killin' the honeybees, you name it.
[00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.990]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:24:25.703 --> 00:24:29.485]  And we know that this Gardasil shot, they could only get the U.S.
[00:24:29.485 --> 00:24:35.689]  and one or two other countries out of over 180 nations to approve it and start pushing it on children.
[00:24:35.689 --> 00:24:37.870]  Then they lie and say it's the law, you've got to take it.
[00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.232]  And Mexico is doing the same thing.
[00:24:41.818 --> 00:24:49.482]  Mexico plans to administer the vaccine against human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer to all girls beginning next year.
[00:24:49.482 --> 00:24:57.125]  The country's health ministry said yesterday, beginning in 2012, the HPV vaccine will be part of the normal course of shots.
[00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.486]  And they just add more, more, more.
[00:24:59.616 --> 00:25:01.397]  Then we get more and more health problems.
[00:25:01.397 --> 00:25:04.739]  And vaccines are linked to kidney failure.
[00:25:04.739 --> 00:25:05.620]  General vaccines.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.580]  Just look it up.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.402]  Just type in vaccines linked to kidney failure.
[00:25:08.402 --> 00:25:10.203]  Vaccines linked to Alzheimer's.
[00:25:10.203 --> 00:25:12.464]  I mean, it's incredible how deadly they are.
[00:25:12.464 --> 00:25:16.847]  Because they're just pumping all this stuff into you.
[00:25:16.847 --> 00:25:19.689]  Everyone at the age of nine will be inoculated.
[00:25:22.304 --> 00:25:27.246]  They admit that deaths from cervical cancer have dropped 47% in the country over the past two decades.
[00:25:27.246 --> 00:25:32.288]  There was still 13.4 cases for every 100,000 women last year.
[00:25:32.288 --> 00:25:36.029]  It is one of the rarest forms of cancer.
[00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:40.351]  You got a hundred and something million people there and 4,200 women supposedly died from it.
[00:25:40.351 --> 00:25:45.672]  And then the vaccine itself causes all sorts of health problems.
[00:25:45.672 --> 00:25:46.773]  And again, when it kills you,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.281]  Again, if a vaccine's killing a percentage of people, you better believe it's dangerous.
[00:25:54.281 --> 00:25:57.582]  French news agency reporting on this.
[00:25:57.582 --> 00:26:05.043]  Mexican health authorities hope that by making HPV vaccine universal, they can cut the mortality rate from this type of cancer by 50% for women under the age of 25.
[00:26:05.043 --> 00:26:09.484]  And it goes on to say it's sexually transmitted.
[00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:14.065]  It's warts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:14.065 --> 00:26:14.845]  And, um...
[00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:27.015]  I've seen other studies that these type of viral infections, you can pull this up, that when you have this type of viral infection, it lowers your chances of getting a whole bunch of different types of cancer.
[00:26:27.015 --> 00:26:30.257]  And the scientists believe that it actually augments your immunity.
[00:26:30.257 --> 00:26:31.999]  You can pull that up.
[00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:34.220]  They're not sure why.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:40.205]  But most cancer they have known for 80 years and kept from the public is viral.
[00:26:41.263 --> 00:26:41.383]  Yes.
[00:27:02.697 --> 00:27:04.857]  Is extremely dangerous.
[00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:08.058]  And now they're going to try to force it on everybody down in Mexico.
[00:27:08.058 --> 00:27:10.819]  And then now there's all these other vaccines coming out.
[00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:14.219]  And now they're trying to force HPV on boys in the U.S.
[00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:18.260]  And it costs hundreds of dollars per shot.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.240]  Hundreds and hundreds.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.000]  What is it?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.101]  To get the three shots, it's almost $500.
[00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:26.541]  But see, the Mexican government will fit the bill.
[00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:29.182]  And then you see the elites obsessed with population reduction.
[00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:52.046]  Many vaccines have been associated with, again, loss of fertility, particularly when they add a hormone that's needed to complete pregnancy, and there's other hormones they add that are needed to complete being able to have your child and carry it through term, that they add to tetanus shots and other vaccines to the body, then has an autoimmune response to
[00:27:53.086 --> 00:28:14.092]  The hormone that's been bound to the tetanus and now the woman can't have children and the body actually attacks the glands that release that hormone that kicks in in that particular case at the second trimester and causes a 100% spontaneous miscarriage and also causes very serious health problems in the women.
[00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:19.973]  And if you don't believe me, just type in UN caught adding sterilization and hormone to tetanus shots and you'll get mainstream news 96, 97, 98.
[00:28:22.352 --> 00:28:26.879]  Look at Times of India, the African, different African countries did test.
[00:28:26.879 --> 00:28:32.708]  It turned out the UN had a program using over a hundred different companies to produce the vaccines over that decade.
[00:28:33.677 --> 00:28:40.301]  That was generally the local payoff as they'd come and use that country's vaccine production, give them the breakdown of how to make it, they would produce it.
[00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:43.422]  So the hormone wasn't added by accident.
[00:28:43.422 --> 00:29:01.713]  So I'm here to tell you, it's not that I'm not saying that some vaccines, it was a particularly deadly disease and it was rampant, and you take the risk of the vaccine to not get polio or whatever the case is, but they're coming out with AIDS vaccines, Ebola vaccines, cancer vaccines, all of this, and you notice cancer's off the charts.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:12.090]  I was on syndicated radio talk show host Eric Muller's show this morning, Man Cow, and he was talking about almost everybody he knows has got cancer.
[00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.912]  Young people, their wives are dying.
[00:29:13.912 --> 00:29:15.594]  It's just death everywhere.
[00:29:15.594 --> 00:29:16.836]  Cancer is off the charts.
[00:29:16.836 --> 00:29:19.058]  Now I said that I was going to get to the
[00:29:21.334 --> 00:29:26.818]  Report on man facing life sentence for recording cops.
[00:29:26.818 --> 00:29:28.600]  And I worked with Paul in this article this morning.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.024]  I wanted to have hoax in the headline, but it says, man faces life in jail for recording police.
[00:29:34.024 --> 00:29:38.007]  Every other case involving people arrested for filming cops has been thrown out of court.
[00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:39.488]  It is all a mass hoax.
[00:29:39.488 --> 00:29:41.270]  Get this article out to everybody.
[00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:46.354]  But I'm going to cover this in more detail, both the Gardasil and this, at the start of the next hour ahead of Ron Paul.
[00:29:46.354 --> 00:29:47.655]  But Colonel Schaefer's up next.
[00:29:49.639 --> 00:29:52.647]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.647 --> 00:29:56.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.187 --> 00:30:04.851]  Already, 2011 is a record-breaking year for disasters.
[00:30:04.851 --> 00:30:06.993]  Your family is your most precious asset.
[00:30:06.993 --> 00:30:10.836]  Could you feed them in case of emergency, food shortage, or job loss?
[00:30:10.836 --> 00:30:13.979]  At eFoods, we offer delicious, ready-made meals.
[00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:23.228]  Cheesy chicken and rice casserole, beef stroganoff, chili with dumplings, with the longest storable shelf life, and easily prepared in minutes by simply adding to boiling water.
[00:30:23.228 --> 00:30:25.230]  Get your six free meals by just paying a small
[00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.231]  We're good to go.
[00:30:45.862 --> 00:30:46.742]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:46.742 --> 00:30:50.984]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:50.984 --> 00:30:53.525]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.953 --> 00:31:16.337]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.337 --> 00:31:19.379]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:21.701]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:27.965]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.965 --> 00:31:31.328]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.328 --> 00:31:37.112]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.112 --> 00:31:38.753]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.753 --> 00:31:39.874]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.034 --> 00:31:42.717]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.717 --> 00:31:46.941]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:51.566]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:51.566 --> 00:31:54.148]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:31:54.148 --> 00:31:58.032]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:58.032 --> 00:31:59.033]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:01.334 --> 00:32:06.016]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:32:06.016 --> 00:32:11.898]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:32:11.898 --> 00:32:14.719]  Number one, study the past.
[00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:17.120]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.842]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:32:21.983 --> 00:32:25.064]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:32:25.064 --> 00:32:28.905]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:33.947]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:32:33.947 --> 00:32:37.948]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:32:37.948 --> 00:32:41.370]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.991]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:45.851 --> 00:32:50.774]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:32:50.774 --> 00:32:55.397]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:55.397 --> 00:33:01.160]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:07.184]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:07.184 --> 00:33:09.706]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:21.957 --> 00:33:23.537]  We are back live.
[00:33:23.537 --> 00:33:25.018]  Colonel Anthony Schaeffer is our guest.
[00:33:25.018 --> 00:33:27.899]  We're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:36.261]  Don't forget, coming up starting tomorrow night, it's quite a commitment, but we're making it because we're reaching so many millions of people.
[00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:40.182]  I kick off InfoWars Nightly News, September 1st.
[00:33:42.622 --> 00:33:43.803]  2011.
[00:33:43.803 --> 00:33:54.707]  So starting tomorrow night, every weeknight, 7 p.m., at least a 30-minute news transmission of condensed, focused, hard-hitting analysis and special reports.
[00:33:54.707 --> 00:34:04.411]  And many nights, we're going to have expanded special reports after the news, live interviews, the premieres of documentaries, all of it, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:05.851 --> 00:34:11.057]  And either later in the show today or tomorrow, I'm going to unveil some new features at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:11.057 --> 00:34:15.262]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV member, please join today.
[00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:20.548]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, or get three months free when you sign up for a year and truly support
[00:34:21.417 --> 00:34:35.645]  The tip of the spear in the alternative media's attempt to awaken this country and the planet to the global crime syndicate so that we can turn the tide and restore our republic and push what I call 1776 worldwide.
[00:34:35.645 --> 00:34:36.386]  The ideas of true liberty as
[00:34:42.532 --> 00:34:50.962]  Enshrined by people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington to take the true ideas of liberty and to promote that on a planetary scale.
[00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:57.791]  So we are one day, seven hours, 25 minutes, six seconds away from the launch of the InfoWars.
[00:34:58.411 --> 00:34:59.592]  Nightly News.
[00:34:59.592 --> 00:35:04.215]  And so much more is going to come out of that, obviously because you've been supporting us over the years.
[00:35:04.215 --> 00:35:07.638]  But if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, today is the day.
[00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:14.763]  Now, Congressman Ron Paul is scheduled to join us coming up in about exactly an hour from now, a little under an hour.
[00:35:14.763 --> 00:35:19.506]  He's scheduled to join us to talk about the campaign and a host of other very important issues.
[00:35:19.506 --> 00:35:21.487]  I'm going to get into the dangerous Gardasil shot.
[00:35:21.487 --> 00:35:27.332]  The Mexican government says they're going to inject every girl in their population, starting with all the nine-year-olds.
[00:35:28.618 --> 00:35:32.282]  They're implying it's going to be forced, though they don't even have that authority, just like here in the U.S.
[00:35:32.282 --> 00:35:32.623]  they don't.
[00:35:32.623 --> 00:35:35.185]  But it started with Rick Perry saying it was the law and you had to.
[00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:37.208]  He's now apologized for that.
[00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:40.411]  A day late, a dollar short, a lot of dead girls behind him.
[00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:43.034]  Lou Rockwell called it criminal and called him a dirty criminal for it.
[00:35:43.034 --> 00:35:43.975]  I agree with that.
[00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:48.180]  Ron Paul's former campaign manager has a lot of courage to stand up against these monsters.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.762]  Rick Perry has also now come out.
[00:35:50.642 --> 00:35:58.669]  Praise Hillary Clinton in speeches and in letters in 1993 and supported Hillarycare, even more socialistic than Obamacare.
[00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:08.823]  Now, joining us with a very important breakdown of Libya, Syria, terror threats and other issues is Lt.
[00:36:08.823 --> 00:36:09.264]  Col.
[00:36:09.264 --> 00:36:10.584]  Anthony Schaffer, U.S.
[00:36:10.584 --> 00:36:24.093]  Army, who gained fame for his reports about the situation with the September 11th attacks and the fact that the military in many areas was basically told to stand down.
[00:36:25.254 --> 00:36:30.018]  And he joins us now to break down the latest geopolitical developments.
[00:36:30.018 --> 00:36:34.821]  OperationDarkHeart.com is where you can find his latest best-selling book.
[00:36:34.821 --> 00:36:36.683]  It's good to have you here with us today, Colonel.
[00:36:36.683 --> 00:36:37.563]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:38.284]  Good to be back on with you.
[00:36:38.284 --> 00:36:39.185]  It's been a while.
[00:36:39.185 --> 00:36:39.745]  Absolutely.
[00:36:39.745 --> 00:36:41.026]  So much is happening.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:43.788]  I've got my questions, but out of the gates, what is...
[00:36:46.377 --> 00:36:48.258]  What bee is under your saddle?
[00:36:48.258 --> 00:36:59.502]  Well, you know, I'm glad you brought up the whole Libya thing, and this is one of the peculiar things where I think we are just totally out to lunch on what's really going on, I think, and we being the American public, for two reasons.
[00:36:59.502 --> 00:37:03.804]  First, I don't know if you're aware of this, but there's been a meeting in Paris this week
[00:37:04.424 --> 00:37:12.947]  With businesses, global businesses, and a lot of Libyan rebels looking at how to carve up the outcome of the Libyan conflict.
[00:37:12.947 --> 00:37:14.787]  And keep in mind, we don't even have a constitution there yet.
[00:37:14.787 --> 00:37:20.489]  Yet you've got folks already trying to make business deals with the rebels, and of course we don't even know who's doing what.
[00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:23.090]  So, you know, when you look at that fact,
[00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:38.578]  And you look at the fact that we've spent a billion dollars, and I know that in terms of the budget it's not significant, but you know, a billion dollars would go a long way to fix a lot of bridges, make a lot of railroads, and relieve a lot of folks who are having a hard time with the economy right now.
[00:37:38.578 --> 00:37:48.543]  So, this has all been done in the name of the White House, and I was just over talking to some staff, some congressional staff, on this very issue last week.
[00:37:48.543 --> 00:37:51.464]  Alex, the Congress has never received a single report.
[00:37:53.292 --> 00:38:06.724]  On what the Pentagon is doing, who they're giving the intel to, and according to the Pentagon in their most recent reports from last week, they have given 60-70% of the intel which has driven the NATO attacks against Gaddafi's targets.
[00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:11.028]  Well, who exactly authorized this?
[00:38:11.028 --> 00:38:13.311]  Because Congress never did this.
[00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:16.034]  And most strikingly, I've been talking to Bruce Fine.
[00:38:16.034 --> 00:38:23.865]  Bruce, you might know, wrote a lot of books on constitutions, a constitutional lawyer, stated without any equivocation that the
[00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:24.165]  No, no, no.
[00:38:49.862 --> 00:39:00.736]  Uh, interest in following what I think most would argue the rule of law and the constitutional basis that requires, you know, a give and take, an oversight system within our government.
[00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:03.097]  Well, I'm glad you brought this up, Colonel.
[00:39:03.097 --> 00:39:06.278]  That was actually one of the things I wanted to raise.
[00:39:06.278 --> 00:39:08.638]  Ron Paul, of course, is called the constitutional lawyer.
[00:39:08.638 --> 00:39:12.619]  Mr. Fine, you know, the top constitutional lawyer in the country.
[00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:15.940]  He's been on this show and said this is impeachable.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.560]  It's completely unconstitutional.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.661]  I know you're still in the military, so you obviously can't go that far.
[00:39:21.661 --> 00:39:26.182]  But when Congress went to Obama four and a half months ago and said, look,
[00:39:26.942 --> 00:39:29.943]  We'll give you the money and the authority, but you've got to go to us.
[00:39:29.943 --> 00:39:33.104]  He said, and put a letter out and said, I don't need Congress.
[00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:33.945]  I have the U.N.
[00:39:33.945 --> 00:39:36.886]  and I'm doing this, quote, for the credibility of the U.N.
[00:39:36.886 --> 00:39:38.927]  And it does add incredible credibility.
[00:39:38.927 --> 00:39:41.267]  It says our president takes his orders from them.
[00:39:41.267 --> 00:39:43.588]  I mean, the Congress makes war, as you know.
[00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:44.969]  You're a commissioned officer.
[00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:46.529]  Congress gives the orders.
[00:39:46.529 --> 00:39:49.410]  The president then executes it as the executive.
[00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.932]  But the board of directors, who are elected by us, is the House, is the Senate.
[00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:55.854]  We don't have a super Congress.
[00:39:55.854 --> 00:39:59.618]  Now the spending and cutting bills don't come from House members.
[00:39:59.618 --> 00:40:03.622]  It just comes from a 12-member super committee with the president, the 13th head.
[00:40:03.622 --> 00:40:06.645]  I mean, so this is a constitutional crisis.
[00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:08.788]  But you just brought up something that I didn't even know.
[00:40:08.788 --> 00:40:11.411]  I saw a blur, but I'd forgotten to cover.
[00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:14.214]  So I guess, for lack of a better term, I didn't know because I never covered it.
[00:40:14.214 --> 00:40:15.975]  You have a tree falls and nobody hears it.
[00:40:16.476 --> 00:40:18.798]  The American public needs to really take notice of this.
[00:40:38.152 --> 00:40:39.853]  There's huge problems.
[00:40:39.853 --> 00:40:45.796]  And again, like you mentioned Alex, it's not like the President wouldn't have gotten authorization or wouldn't have gotten money.
[00:40:45.796 --> 00:40:49.617]  He just chose to not deal with it and say what I'm doing is not a war.
[00:40:49.617 --> 00:40:51.999]  Now think about the logic here that he's using.
[00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:54.800]  Because by President Obama's logic and the way they're approaching this,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:01.607]  You could use a nuclear weapon on a country and say, oh, it's not really a war because we didn't have boots on the ground.
[00:41:01.607 --> 00:41:12.858]  So that's how insane the premise of the policy is, that you could actually use an incredible amount of deadly force against any given target on the planet and basically say, ah, it's not really a war because we didn't put boots on the ground.
[00:41:12.998 --> 00:41:19.164]  Well, Colonel, this is Caesar crossing the Rubicon that led to the end of the Roman Republic.
[00:41:19.164 --> 00:41:22.567]  And Obama's lawyers know exactly what they're doing.
[00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:25.890]  The Pentagon lawyers, as you know, came to him and said, you can't do this.
[00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.191]  And he said, I'll do whatever I want.
[00:41:27.191 --> 00:41:30.475]  So this is brazen and being consciously done.
[00:41:30.475 --> 00:41:34.679]  Talking to other military brash who you speak with.
[00:41:35.435 --> 00:41:39.619]  Yeah, I've spoken to several retired generals who have worked in a variety of administrations.
[00:41:45.073 --> 00:41:54.798]  And you might find this ironic, but one of the administrations which I was told had the greatest interest in listening to generals was actually President Clinton.
[00:41:54.798 --> 00:41:59.021]  Clinton would actually bring folks in and talk to them if they disagreed with policy.
[00:41:59.021 --> 00:42:01.262]  From what I'm hearing, Alex, that's not going on now.
[00:42:01.262 --> 00:42:05.244]  It essentially is a send mode only.
[00:42:05.244 --> 00:42:09.526]  Basically, you take the policy, you try to figure it out, and you move forward with it, and that's about it.
[00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:12.368]  And if you have concerns, then the concerns are really not welcome.
[00:42:12.888 --> 00:42:18.574]  And this is a dangerous trend because we as officers are trained to give our best judgment.
[00:42:18.574 --> 00:42:22.478]  And if our judgment is it's not a good idea, we need to be able to tell you that.
[00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:24.119]  And we're not telling you to be disloyal.
[00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:26.622]  We're telling you because there's reasons why you need to be cautious.
[00:42:26.622 --> 00:42:28.123]  Well, it's more than dangerous.
[00:42:28.123 --> 00:42:30.466]  It is absolute 100% tyranny.
[00:42:30.466 --> 00:42:31.347]  It is 200 proof evil.
[00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:41.317]  If a president's crazy and doesn't want to listen to the military, that's one thing.
[00:42:41.317 --> 00:42:42.278]  He is the commander-in-chief.
[00:42:42.278 --> 00:42:50.726]  But he's only the commander-in-chief once Congress gives him the green light to execute their declaration of war or their authorization to use force, as you know.
[00:42:50.726 --> 00:42:55.191]  So this is a complete departure from the Constitution.
[00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:56.632]  And we're seeing it on the power of the purse.
[00:42:57.253 --> 00:43:01.056]  We're seeing them implement gun control regulations outside of law.
[00:43:01.056 --> 00:43:04.278]  We're seeing it done with carbon taxes with power plants.
[00:43:04.278 --> 00:43:07.241]  We're seeing health care law selectively enforced.
[00:43:07.241 --> 00:43:13.105]  This, for all intents and purposes, has transitioned into what you could call a dictatorship.
[00:43:13.105 --> 00:43:16.788]  A stealth dictatorship, but nonetheless a dictatorship.
[00:43:17.863 --> 00:43:22.885]  Well, my concern is, as you mentioned, Alex, there's ways, there's things in the American public's domain that they can see this.
[00:43:22.885 --> 00:43:35.809]  First off, I don't care how you feel about the Protection of Marriage Act, but the idea is, if it's a law, I'd say the Justice Department is obligated to enforce that law, to include going and fighting for it in court.
[00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:38.030]  That's one of the things that the Obama administration just said.
[00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.131]  Well, you know, we don't like this.
[00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:41.831]  We're not going to enforce it.
[00:43:41.831 --> 00:43:45.012]  On the military side, your points are super well taken.
[00:43:45.012 --> 00:43:45.572]  I've spoken.
[00:43:45.572 --> 00:43:47.493]  I don't know if you all knew that you do this.
[00:43:47.493 --> 00:43:53.475]  I debated Representative Paul on the John Stossel Show about three months ago, four months ago in March.
[00:43:54.195 --> 00:43:54.716]  I think so.
[00:44:11.984 --> 00:44:13.825]  Yeah, spending bills begin in the House.
[00:44:13.825 --> 00:44:14.445]  It's law.
[00:44:14.445 --> 00:44:15.886]  And it's got to stay like that.
[00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:22.689]  The whole idea of a super committee, and I've heard Representative Paul say this, he doesn't see where there's any legal constitutional grounds for the super committee to exist.
[00:44:22.689 --> 00:44:26.250]  And I've got to tell you, I talked to Bruce Fine, Bruce says the same thing.
[00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.992]  There's just nothing there that allows this to happen.
[00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:36.155]  And the other point, obviously, is whenever you spend money, you've got to have clear and compelling justification to do that.
[00:44:36.155 --> 00:44:38.696]  And I just don't think we're getting our money's worth.
[00:44:39.336 --> 00:44:56.935]  Regarding that, and when we look at this, Alex, one of the things I'd like to bring up as an oversight issue is the fact that any time, and let's look at this from the macro to the micro, in our big scheme of things, we use military force, deadly force, all the time as a tool of national will.
[00:44:57.715 --> 00:45:08.122]  And when you look at the micro, when you look at a policeman on the street having to do something to support a law, anytime he uses deadly force there's an investigation.
[00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:14.006]  There's basically a full review process that says, was this officer justified in using deadly force?
[00:45:15.487 --> 00:45:21.253]  Well, the problem is we never look at the national equivalent of an officer using deadly force.
[00:45:21.253 --> 00:45:27.398]  We constantly use military operations, military capabilities without understanding three things.
[00:45:27.398 --> 00:45:29.000]  First, was it legal?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.883]  Was it the right call to make based on the intel?
[00:45:31.883 --> 00:45:36.267]  I think we would all agree that despite what Vice President Cheney says now,
[00:45:36.707 --> 00:45:40.570]  I don't believe the intel was ever there to justify an Iraqi invasion.
[00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:41.710]  I was on the inside at the time.
[00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.873]  The stuff they're talking about now, I never saw.
[00:45:44.873 --> 00:45:48.115]  Saddam Hussein was never a, quote unquote, a proliferator of weapons.
[00:45:48.115 --> 00:45:50.156]  He may have been interested, but he wasn't proliferating.
[00:45:50.156 --> 00:45:51.597]  So, you've got to look at the intel.
[00:45:51.597 --> 00:45:58.762]  Second thing, you've got to figure out that if the intel justified your actions, did you create the appropriate response to the threat?
[00:45:59.362 --> 00:46:02.124]  And third and most importantly, what is the outcome?
[00:46:02.124 --> 00:46:11.150]  Did your use of military force achieve a specific goal or objective that is in the best interest of our nation's policy?
[00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.872]  Is this what we should do?
[00:46:12.872 --> 00:46:21.218]  And so if it's good enough for a beat cop to be looked at with a great deal of scrutiny for using deadly force, I don't know why we don't do it at the national level.
[00:46:21.218 --> 00:46:26.962]  Well, continuing, it's always in every case in history, as you know, as a military officer who studied history,
[00:46:28.181 --> 00:46:37.043]  When leaders start amassing all the power into themselves, especially the power of the purse and the power of force, that is when the big alarms go off.
[00:46:37.043 --> 00:46:38.643]  And I'll just say it.
[00:46:38.643 --> 00:46:49.166]  If you read the definition of treason, and then high treason, it is working with a foreign power to undermine the system of government of the nation.
[00:46:50.246 --> 00:46:51.607]  Of which you serve.
[00:46:51.607 --> 00:46:55.469]  And that's the basic definition of not just treason, but high treason.
[00:46:55.469 --> 00:47:03.034]  Because high treason is if you're in a position of power and trust, and have sworn an oath, and you lower the drawbridge for the enemy to come in.
[00:47:03.034 --> 00:47:12.459]  Now, Obama says to Congress when they sue him, when they rebuff him, when everything, and when they offer him the money and the power, because that's their job,
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.923]  He says, I don't need you, puts a letter out saying, I do this for the credibility of the UN.
[00:47:18.923 --> 00:47:20.004]  I'm sorry.
[00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:36.113]  That is not only treason, it is the definition of high treason to undermine the legitimate government and transfer the power through fraud to a foreign entity away from the elected government of the Republic.
[00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.293]  As you said, he could use nuclear weapons now and say the UN told him to.
[00:47:40.293 --> 00:47:42.376]  I mean, it's even worse.
[00:47:42.376 --> 00:47:47.883]  If he was power-grabbing, he would still be an American dictator and it would be treasonous.
[00:47:47.883 --> 00:47:52.529]  Now he's doing it and saying, I do it under a foreign entity's auspices.
[00:47:52.529 --> 00:47:54.251]  If this is not high treason, nothing is.
[00:47:54.651 --> 00:48:07.679]  Well, I've heard several other congressmen talk about the issues, Representative Kucinich has talked about this, and as you know, several congressmen have actually sued President Obama over the very issues you're talking about.
[00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:16.785]  There's now a court action saying President Obama has failed to support the requirements of his office relating to war powers and things of that nature.
[00:48:16.785 --> 00:48:22.728]  So, what I'm concerned about is that the American public doesn't seem to be looking at this with any sort of fervor.
[00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:29.932]  The fact that we have... I don't care how they argue the fact that we've only got aircraft involved.
[00:48:29.932 --> 00:48:37.855]  And frankly, between you and me, Alex, I've heard that we've got guys on the ground doing things to support... I've talked to the army soldiers by name.
[00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:40.297]  There's at least 50 dead U.S.
[00:48:40.297 --> 00:48:44.318]  Army alone that have been brought into the receiving center in the last four and a half months.
[00:48:44.318 --> 00:48:49.601]  There's special forces all over the place commanding the jihadis.
[00:48:50.041 --> 00:48:51.782]  And so this is the deal.
[00:48:51.782 --> 00:48:55.483]  I don't understand why the American people are the only ones who are being kind of kept in the dark here.
[00:48:55.483 --> 00:49:01.364]  I mean, everybody, you know, one of my sources was a foreign national who told me about boots on the ground being there in Libya.
[00:49:01.364 --> 00:49:07.786]  Now imagine this, a foreign national, a former Libyan senior official tells me that he knows we've got boots on the ground.
[00:49:07.786 --> 00:49:13.268]  So apparently the joke's on the American people because they're the only ones who are not being told the full truth about what's going on.
[00:49:13.268 --> 00:49:16.549]  And again, you know, you could have, we should have a debate.
[00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:26.381]  Yes sir, but let me interrupt you and just get right to the heart of it.
[00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:29.485]  I don't want to come back and hit a few other issues with you, but I'm glad you brought this up.
[00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:41.982]  I understand you're a commissioned officer, you still serve, and so obviously you're not going to say it's treason or high treason, but you come back and say it's up to the American people to wake up and start having a debate about this.
[00:49:41.982 --> 00:49:43.322]  I don't hear you disagreeing.
[00:49:43.322 --> 00:49:52.005]  I just want listeners to understand, this is happening in plain view, and if the government gets away with this, if the executive gets away with this, then the sky is the limit.
[00:49:52.005 --> 00:49:52.465]  Your comment.
[00:49:52.998 --> 00:49:53.459]  Absolutely.
[00:49:53.459 --> 00:50:03.451]  I mean, we've seen this on several issues relating to how the government is amassing power, and in this case, the executive branch primarily.
[00:50:03.451 --> 00:50:04.913]  The center of this is Congress.
[00:50:04.913 --> 00:50:09.239]  It has to be the thing that says, enough is enough.
[00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:11.722]  And this is where I just don't understand.
[00:50:12.202 --> 00:50:12.882]  Of course it is!
[00:50:29.488 --> 00:50:35.433]  I mean, no one's endorsing pilfering women, but at the end of the day, this affects us all.
[00:50:35.433 --> 00:50:36.595]  Colonel Schaefer, please stay there.
[00:50:36.595 --> 00:50:49.086]  I want to come back and get into LA Times, you name it, confirming that the core leaders and the folks that have taken Tripoli are bonafide real Al-Qaeda that have been killing Americans in Iraq.
[00:50:49.086 --> 00:50:49.987]  They brag about it.
[00:50:49.987 --> 00:50:51.728]  We'll get your view on that on the other side.
[00:50:51.728 --> 00:50:52.149]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.723 --> 00:51:01.624]  Attention gardeners!
[00:51:01.624 --> 00:51:04.226]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:51:04.226 --> 00:51:08.730]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:16.597]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:51:16.917 --> 00:51:20.039]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:51:20.039 --> 00:51:27.664]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:51:27.664 --> 00:51:33.487]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:51:33.487 --> 00:51:39.331]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:42.573]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:51:42.873 --> 00:51:46.458]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:51:46.458 --> 00:51:51.525]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:54.449]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:54.449 --> 00:51:54.630]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:05.964]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[00:52:05.964 --> 00:52:09.186]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[00:52:41.188 --> 00:52:47.593]  Shoot an email with InfoWars Team in the subject line to InfoWars Team Coordinator, MZ, and tell him a little bit about yourself.
[00:52:47.833 --> 00:52:50.734]  That's the initials MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:53.214]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[00:52:53.214 --> 00:52:56.975]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[00:52:56.975 --> 00:53:00.195]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[00:53:00.195 --> 00:53:06.616]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.037]  I lost 20 pounds.
[00:53:08.037 --> 00:53:09.717]  I lost 40 pounds.
[00:53:09.717 --> 00:53:11.997]  I lost 55 pounds.
[00:53:11.997 --> 00:53:13.398]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[00:53:14.904 --> 00:53:21.790]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:25.433]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[00:53:25.433 --> 00:53:29.516]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[00:53:29.516 --> 00:53:36.461]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[00:53:36.461 --> 00:53:44.308]  Plus, Amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[00:53:51.355 --> 00:53:51.615]  That's 1-800-737-9107.
[00:53:51.615 --> 00:53:51.675]  1-800-737-9107.
[00:54:13.002 --> 00:54:15.685]  You go to DrudgeReport.com or Infowars.com
[00:54:33.564 --> 00:54:49.550]  There is the headline, man faces life in prison for recording police, and what's scary about this, talk about lawlessness, 12 states now will put you in jail or attempt to if you film police in public, even at a city council meeting, and that's in the news report.
[00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:54.832]  He's facing life in prison, and the prosecutor and people said, we want to teach people a lesson.
[00:54:54.832 --> 00:54:57.793]  Now, understand, this is not wiretapping.
[00:54:57.793 --> 00:55:01.634]  This is not what the statute says, but people have been sent to jail for this.
[00:55:01.634 --> 00:55:02.715]  Most of these get thrown out.
[00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.874]  But in 12 states, the cops don't care.
[00:55:05.874 --> 00:55:13.388]  They will waste taxpayer money and ruin somebody's life just to try to create a chilling effect so people won't videotape police.
[00:55:13.388 --> 00:55:15.212]  And that is bonafide, naked...
[00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:20.671]  Tyranny at its worst right there, so we're gonna be breaking that down more in the next hour.
[00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:27.193]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, best-selling author, researcher, led the big unit that could have killed Bin Laden.
[00:55:27.193 --> 00:55:29.454]  You've seen those reports, it's confirmed.
[00:55:29.454 --> 00:55:33.035]  Ten years ago, before 9-11, and here he is today.
[00:55:33.035 --> 00:55:42.317]  And of course, he exposed able danger and so much more, has a lot of courage, and he says what he can say here on air, but you heard him earlier getting into the power grab that's happening.
[00:55:42.317 --> 00:55:43.998]  Let's talk about
[00:55:44.858 --> 00:55:45.219]  I don't
[00:55:59.915 --> 00:56:00.095]  Yes.
[00:56:17.183 --> 00:56:23.545]  Offer to give back the guy that bombed the Pan Am plane who lied about dying of cancer and obviously isn't dead.
[00:56:23.545 --> 00:56:24.945]  I mean that's another big symbol.
[00:56:24.945 --> 00:56:26.646]  They said they're bringing in Sharia law.
[00:56:26.646 --> 00:56:28.806]  The bags are going back on the heads.
[00:56:28.806 --> 00:56:30.267]  The same thing's happening in Egypt.
[00:56:30.267 --> 00:56:32.888]  They're going to kick out Assad, put jihadis in.
[00:56:32.888 --> 00:56:34.168]  I mean what's going on here Colonel?
[00:56:34.628 --> 00:56:40.331]  Well, I think we have been dealing with the situation with a great deal of naivete, I think.
[00:56:40.331 --> 00:56:43.893]  The story you're talking about regarding the Al Qaeda guys, this has been mainstream media.
[00:56:43.893 --> 00:56:50.857]  I mean, I know Fox covered the fact that these guys had clear and direct links with Al Qaeda, so I'm not quite sure, again, what we're missing here.
[00:56:50.857 --> 00:57:01.043]  And several folks, to include folks on the Hill, took to task, Senator McCain, when he went over there and said, these guys are all right, it just doesn't make sense.
[00:57:01.863 --> 00:57:07.487]  The other thing you have to understand about this, Alex, is these guys, Al-Qaeda guys, are very persistent.
[00:57:07.487 --> 00:57:08.228]  They have a plan.
[00:57:08.228 --> 00:57:12.310]  I don't know if you ever saw the old Battlestar Galactica reimagined.
[00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:13.671]  They're kind of like the Cylons.
[00:57:13.671 --> 00:57:14.992]  They've got a plan they're moving forward with.
[00:57:14.992 --> 00:57:16.613]  Yeah, they're not going to stop.
[00:57:16.613 --> 00:57:18.534]  But here's the issue.
[00:57:18.534 --> 00:57:21.596]  Give them Afghanistan after the end of the Soviet deal.
[00:57:21.596 --> 00:57:23.257]  Now give them Libya and all that money?
[00:57:23.257 --> 00:57:23.458]  What?
[00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:27.888]  Well, this is where we have to be smarter about how we use our resources.
[00:57:27.888 --> 00:57:29.728]  We can't be everywhere constantly.
[00:57:29.728 --> 00:57:32.389]  Therefore, we have to be very careful about how we deal with this.
[00:57:32.389 --> 00:57:34.489]  We don't have to be physically everywhere to deal with these guys.
[00:57:34.489 --> 00:57:38.510]  I know, but Colonel, look, the Pentagon, you say, doesn't make sense.
[00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:42.951]  Use them against the Soviets, use them against the Serbs, use them to take our liberties here at home.
[00:57:42.951 --> 00:57:44.091]  It actually makes perfect sense.
[00:57:44.091 --> 00:57:47.492]  They've got to give al-Qaeda a new base so they can blow them up in five years.
[00:57:48.837 --> 00:57:49.577]  I don't know about that.
[00:57:49.577 --> 00:57:49.897]  I'm not sure.
[00:57:49.897 --> 00:57:51.858]  I'm not into that strategy.
[00:57:51.858 --> 00:57:54.879]  But I do know that we've been ignoring things which are obvious.
[00:57:54.879 --> 00:58:02.982]  And one of the things we didn't take into account with Iraq is that Iraq turned out to be a hugely successful training ground for al-Qaeda.
[00:58:02.982 --> 00:58:07.903]  Yeah, we may be rolling back a little bit, but first off, you know, one of the things about Iraq, we haven't won there yet.
[00:58:07.903 --> 00:58:08.904]  I don't think people understand that.
[00:58:10.675 --> 00:58:11.816]  But that's what you just hear.
[00:58:11.816 --> 00:58:12.496]  You know, you're right.
[00:58:12.496 --> 00:58:18.239]  For those that don't know, most of these jihadis that are admitted to al-Qaeda are veterans of eight years in Iraq.
[00:58:18.239 --> 00:58:22.602]  And they make comments like, I hate Americans, but I also hate Gaddafi.
[00:58:22.602 --> 00:58:23.462]  What is this?
[00:58:23.462 --> 00:58:27.244]  You know, the West hates Gaddafi so much, they're going to give Libya to al-Qaeda?
[00:58:27.244 --> 00:58:27.585]  Stay there.
[00:58:27.585 --> 00:58:28.485]  Back in one minute, sirs.
[00:58:28.485 --> 00:58:30.446]  You can really flesh this out for us.
[00:58:30.446 --> 00:58:34.889]  But I mean, I've got to get my rights up because al-Qaeda is hiding under my table.
[00:58:34.889 --> 00:58:37.670]  But then meanwhile, I got to hear about al-Qaeda or freedom fighters.
[00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:38.191]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:51.806]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.806 --> 00:58:55.829]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:59.071]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.071 --> 00:59:03.875]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:59:03.875 --> 00:59:10.259]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.259 --> 00:59:12.501]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:13.341]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:13.841]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.841 --> 00:59:14.382]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.382 --> 00:59:15.182]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.182 --> 00:59:17.303]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.929 --> 00:59:34.071]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:39.215]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.215 --> 00:59:53.527]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.527 --> 00:59:55.909]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.909 --> 00:59:58.672]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.253 --> 01:00:10.096]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.096 --> 01:00:11.677]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:13.219]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.219 --> 01:00:17.421]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:22.705]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.705 --> 01:00:25.607]  He's the author of Operation Dark Art.
[01:00:25.607 --> 01:00:26.668]  Excellent book.
[01:00:26.668 --> 01:00:28.449]  Some of it got excised by the Pentagon.
[01:00:28.449 --> 01:00:29.330]  I didn't want you reading it.
[01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:33.533]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, during the one minute break, he was getting into it.
[01:00:33.533 --> 01:00:34.994]  Look how fast Tripoli fell.
[01:00:34.994 --> 01:00:35.294]  U.S.
[01:00:35.294 --> 01:00:36.035]  troops involved.
[01:00:36.035 --> 01:00:37.416]  We're in the dark.
[01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.337]  Wolfowitz is the engineer of this.
[01:00:39.337 --> 01:00:41.318]  You got the floor in the last five minutes, Colonel.
[01:00:41.318 --> 01:00:42.059]  Take it away.
[01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:49.224]  Well, one of my credible sources told me a while back that the real power that pushed us into this conflict was two notable figures.
[01:00:49.224 --> 01:00:53.487]  One was Samantha Powers, one of the notable advisors to President Obama.
[01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:59.931]  And then also a shadowy figure, which I was kind of surprised to hear about, but when you look at it, I guess it makes perfect sense, is Paul Wolfowitz.
[01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:06.058]  Apparently, the two of them got together and did a memo which basically said, hey, we need to do something here.
[01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:12.587]  And I think most folks understood going in that the humanitarian guise for the whole thing was a total sham.
[01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:18.835]  And so when you look at it, and the thing for your audience to consider here is, you know, we've been watching this war for months.
[01:01:19.415 --> 01:01:26.757]  You know, we've been seeing these rebels who can barely even, you know, shoot an AK-47 the right way without, you know, killing themselves.
[01:01:26.757 --> 01:01:33.599]  And all of a sudden, they grow efficiency and are able to storm Tripoli and take it over.
[01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:35.560]  So what's wrong with this picture?
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.680]  I mean, you guys can see it.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.882]  I mean, you see some of this in the shadows of the press if you look at it very carefully.
[01:01:40.882 --> 01:01:48.005]  There's been a rumor now that certain special operations units of both the British and possibly the U.S.
[01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.386]  were actually advising these guys, helping them to organize.
[01:01:50.386 --> 01:02:02.672]  So when you look on the face of it, you really do come to see that there's no way the rebels could have self-organized, moved in rapidly and taken over the size of Tripoli without some level of help.
[01:02:02.672 --> 01:02:03.873]  And so, again, this is where...
[01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:05.093]  I'm concerned.
[01:02:05.093 --> 01:02:05.954]  I think everybody should be concerned.
[01:02:05.954 --> 01:02:21.451]  Well, sir, it's now confirmed that a whole bunch of special forces from other Arab nations, the French, the British, the U.S., the night landing, and there's been videos and photos released of Anglos up there firing anti-tank guns and other systems.
[01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:24.214]  So there's now no doubt that they were used there.
[01:02:24.214 --> 01:02:24.354]  Yeah.
[01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.578]  We've got to be smarter.
[01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:33.562]  I don't know why we're not thinking this through, and maybe we're purposely not thinking this through.
[01:02:33.562 --> 01:02:40.648]  Maybe there's something I don't understand, but from a military perspective, from looking at the situation from a military perspective, there's two key things.
[01:02:40.648 --> 01:02:47.314]  First, if we really wanted to get this done, we should have done it in a month with one armored brigade going in, cutting through, and being done.
[01:02:47.594 --> 01:02:52.878]  And frankly, we would have killed—less civilians would have died by us taking direct action if you go in.
[01:02:52.878 --> 01:02:56.862]  And this goes to the Colin Powell comment that George Bush, if you break it, you own it.
[01:02:56.862 --> 01:03:01.125]  Well, we broke it, and we're not willing to own up to the fact that we've made the situation bad.
[01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:04.048]  Secondly, and more importantly, Alex, is the fact that we really don't know
[01:03:04.608 --> 01:03:08.110]  Well, he'd also rolled over seven years ago, gave up the WMDs, started investing his money in Western banks.
[01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:10.812]  This sends a signal, you come on out of the cold, we're going to betray you.
[01:03:33.985 --> 01:03:34.566]  Right.
[01:03:34.566 --> 01:03:46.437]  And this is where I think, of course, we ignore the fact that we should have done something years ago if we're going to do something against him based on the things he did regarding Walker being in the bombings, the disco bombings in Germany.
[01:03:46.437 --> 01:03:49.379]  With that said, we've waited all this time and now all of a sudden we're upset with him.
[01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:50.801]  It doesn't pass the common sense test.
[01:03:50.801 --> 01:03:56.466]  And this is where I think there's some other things that the American people need to be demanding that Congress look into.
[01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:59.088]  This screams for investigation, Alex.
[01:03:59.088 --> 01:03:59.569]  It really does.
[01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:02.131]  Well, now you talk about you break it, you own it.
[01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:15.323]  They admit most of the country, no power, water, and it's a big population that was living in an industrialized system, and reportedly it is descending into a humanitarian nightmare, the very thing they claim the war was for.
[01:04:15.703 --> 01:04:16.563]  Exactly.
[01:04:16.563 --> 01:04:20.164]  I said that a week ago on one of the programs on cable.
[01:04:20.164 --> 01:04:29.547]  I said, we will see a descent into chaos because no one's really in charge and because of the real objectives of the new group is not really to bring the country together.
[01:04:29.547 --> 01:04:34.429]  I think you're going to see a Bosnia-esque situation, a balkanization, if you will, of the environment.
[01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:35.989]  And it's just not going to be helpful for anybody.
[01:04:36.943 --> 01:04:44.526]  Colonel, I look forward to speaking to you in the near future, hopefully in the next few weeks, because this is unfolding and your analysis is piercing.
[01:04:44.526 --> 01:04:45.766]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:04:45.766 --> 01:04:47.707]  Author of Operation Dark Art.
[01:04:47.707 --> 01:04:48.447]  Take care, Colonel.
[01:04:48.447 --> 01:04:49.507]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:49.507 --> 01:04:51.028]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:51.028 --> 01:04:54.269]  We're going to get into the Gardasil shots in Mexico.
[01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:57.370]  Police, life in prison for filming them.
[01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.471]  Ron Paul's coming up.
[01:04:58.471 --> 01:04:58.951]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.452 --> 01:05:06.413]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.413 --> 01:05:15.274]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:19.915]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:30.737]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.357 --> 01:05:40.880]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:46.302]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.302 --> 01:05:53.785]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.785 --> 01:05:56.206]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.590]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:08.511]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:11.052]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.052 --> 01:06:16.433]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.433 --> 01:06:19.473]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.473 --> 01:06:21.794]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:28.035]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.035 --> 01:06:28.475]  In fact,
[01:06:28.755 --> 01:06:31.416]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.416 --> 01:06:37.198]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.198 --> 01:06:38.839]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.839 --> 01:06:40.139]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.139 --> 01:06:42.800]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.042]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.042 --> 01:06:51.664]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:06:51.664 --> 01:06:54.245]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:06:54.245 --> 01:06:57.286]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:06:58.106 --> 01:07:00.008]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:00.008 --> 01:07:04.552]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.552 --> 01:07:08.895]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.895 --> 01:07:14.280]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.381]  It's true.
[01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:21.085]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:24.668]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:29.391]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.391 --> 01:07:32.153]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.153 --> 01:07:35.496]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.816 --> 01:07:40.758]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.758 --> 01:07:45.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.981]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.981 --> 01:07:51.762]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.762 --> 01:07:56.364]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:01.624 --> 01:08:04.392]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.392 --> 01:08:07.200]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.996 --> 01:08:22.038]  Okay, Ron Paul is scheduled later in the hour.
[01:08:22.038 --> 01:08:29.723]  We were going to get Bernard von Notaus on in the next hour, but we're able to get him now, so we've got him.
[01:08:29.723 --> 01:08:38.909]  And then in the third hour, I'm going to get into four cigar-de-sil shots coming to Mexico and all the carnage that it's left in its wake here in the U.S.
[01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:41.531]  We're also going to get into Rick Perry.
[01:08:41.531 --> 01:08:48.756]  It's now emerging was a big Hillary care supporter and gave speeches and wrote letters and said, oh, yes, we must have socialism.
[01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:51.017]  So that means mainline Republicans.
[01:08:51.017 --> 01:08:53.539]  There's nothing more they love than getting getting con.
[01:08:53.539 --> 01:08:56.461]  So they're going to line up for that big time.
[01:08:56.461 --> 01:08:58.562]  Of course, they can vote for Obamacare, Mitt Romney.
[01:08:59.383 --> 01:09:00.123]  They like that too.
[01:09:00.123 --> 01:09:03.005]  The worse the candidate, and the more they lie to them, they just love it.
[01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:07.888]  So we're going to be talking about that as well coming up with Ron Paul.
[01:09:07.888 --> 01:09:14.232]  Also continuing here with the news, we're going to look at what's happening in the economy.
[01:09:14.232 --> 01:09:23.317]  A jam-packed transmission lined up for you today.
[01:09:23.317 --> 01:09:23.457]  Now,
[01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:38.247]  Six months ago, Bernard von Notausch, who for decades ran the Royal Hawaiian Mint, and who also then 14 years ago, or 14 plus now, set up the Liberty Dollar.
[01:09:38.247 --> 01:09:41.891]  And it's an open silver and gold backed system.
[01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:43.670]  That's right.
[01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.533]  Usually for about 10-15 bucks.
[01:10:05.533 --> 01:10:09.916]  You won't actually see the last time we had actual dollars in this country.
[01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:13.159]  It was 1963 and you know the bankers didn't like that too much.
[01:10:13.159 --> 01:10:16.161]  So he issued silver and gold rounds or coins.
[01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:19.383]  There are hundreds of companies out there over the years.
[01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:22.065]  Thousands that have commissioned coins at different mints.
[01:10:23.215 --> 01:10:28.439]  I mean, there's Ron Paul coins, there's university coins, there's military coins.
[01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:30.621]  You see the ads constantly.
[01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:47.074]  I mean, my entire life on TV, especially on Saturday and Sunday, you see coin ads up there from this mint or that mint, or companies find a sunken ship with 10,000 ounces of silver and they strike them into new coins with the image of the ship on it.
[01:10:47.074 --> 01:10:48.495]  I mean, you see those ads.
[01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:49.796]  I mean, I've ordered them myself.
[01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:57.133]  And when they convicted him because of a pet jury, and by the way, they're convicting people of filming police in public.
[01:10:57.133 --> 01:11:05.735]  It's not eavesdropping, and later courts overthrow it, but they can get juries to send a child to the gas chamber for not brushing their teeth.
[01:11:05.735 --> 01:11:10.856]  I mean, they can get a jury because these prosecutors play on their ignorance to do anything.
[01:11:11.873 --> 01:11:16.916]  And 98% of people are convicted in federal court because these are kept juries.
[01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:17.817]  They don't really rotate.
[01:11:17.817 --> 01:11:21.939]  It's just one group of normally criminals that sit on them.
[01:11:21.939 --> 01:11:24.060]  So it might not have been ignorance.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.141]  They allow informants to come in and lie knowingly.
[01:11:26.141 --> 01:11:28.022]  I mean, it's very dangerous.
[01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:31.845]  So Bernard Von Nohaus
[01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:33.926]  It didn't take it like a joke.
[01:11:33.926 --> 01:11:36.208]  He said, this is ridiculous, haha, I'm not worried.
[01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:37.949]  He went in, they convicted him.
[01:11:37.949 --> 01:11:47.097]  Even the AP's own analysis, we're going to him, the day after it said, this is crazy, we've checked the law, this isn't counterfeiting Federal Reserve notes or anything, it's silver and gold coins.
[01:11:47.097 --> 01:11:48.938]  There's all these other companies.
[01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:54.543]  And in their statement, they said, this is the FBI Charlotte division from the US Attorney,
[01:11:55.686 --> 01:12:02.571]  It says, attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country, that's what the Federal Reserve's done, are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism.
[01:12:02.571 --> 01:12:05.213]  Well, that's what the Federal Reserve is, yeah, a terrorist.
[01:12:05.213 --> 01:12:05.474]  U.S.
[01:12:05.474 --> 01:12:17.583]  Attorney Tompkins said in announcing the verdict, while these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of our country, she added.
[01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.765]  We are determined to meet these threats through
[01:12:20.325 --> 01:12:27.955]  Infiltration, disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government.
[01:12:27.955 --> 01:12:28.936]  Democratic!
[01:12:28.936 --> 01:12:33.002]  Now the, this is what I've got Mr. Notehouse on about.
[01:12:33.002 --> 01:12:34.143]  I wanted to fill you in.
[01:12:35.558 --> 01:12:58.138]  Now, the Secret Service has announced, and CoinWorld has reported on it, so has Infowars.com, Feds May Seize Liberty Dollars, that yes, the coins are illegal to even hold, even if it's for educational purposes, just like they're now saying Gibson guitars or any other wooden furniture, firearms, that could now be an endangered tree.
[01:12:58.138 --> 01:13:01.502]  If you can't prove when you bought it, they're going to start SWAT teaming you, and it's beginning.
[01:13:02.182 --> 01:13:07.187]  So, gold, silver, coins, wood, firearms, wooden guitars.
[01:13:07.187 --> 01:13:08.068]  I mean, it's on.
[01:13:08.068 --> 01:13:19.239]  Thousands of arrests or raids, dozens of times I've seen where they've arrested people selling lemonade, Amish being raided, people being arrested or fined for having garage sales.
[01:13:19.239 --> 01:13:19.739]  It's on.
[01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:21.621]  You don't have gardens in your yard.
[01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:22.001]  It's on.
[01:13:22.782 --> 01:13:23.242]  It's on.
[01:13:23.242 --> 01:13:27.105]  The Depression's here, and you are not going to be self-sufficient.
[01:13:27.105 --> 01:13:37.973]  You're not going to have an alternative currency, but the good news is they may have hurt this guy and made him a martyr for now, but like a phoenix, seven states have passed or are passing laws to bring in silver.
[01:13:37.973 --> 01:13:42.777]  So, this idea, it's time has come and no army can stop it.
[01:13:42.777 --> 01:13:46.359]  And so we are joined by Bernard Von Notow.
[01:13:46.359 --> 01:13:49.242]  Sir, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:13:49.242 --> 01:13:50.402]  Alex, it's always a pleasure to visit with you.
[01:13:51.721 --> 01:14:05.027]  Well, tell us about how you've been doing, waiting for sentencing six months from their lordships and their kangaroo imperial court, and what you make of their statement that your coins themselves are counterfeit.
[01:14:06.516 --> 01:14:17.585]  Well, I've been holding up pretty well, Alex, even though it's been almost a half a year since I was convicted, and I still don't know when I'm going to be sentenced, which is probably still months away.
[01:14:17.585 --> 01:14:25.792]  But, you know, I've been whiling away, working on my pet projects, but I am particularly incensed and alarmed
[01:14:26.432 --> 01:14:34.256]  By the recent article that Coin World just announced that Liberty Dollars may be subject to seizure.
[01:14:34.256 --> 01:14:47.922]  This is a gross expansion on a part of the government and I don't think they really realize what they're sticking their male member or female member into, quite frankly, right now, you know?
[01:14:47.922 --> 01:14:52.524]  And by that, you're, this, their ruling, their statement,
[01:14:53.274 --> 01:15:10.139]  Their kangaroo largesse, their administrative law, which does come out of the end that you don't eat with, they are saying that all gold and silver is illegal.
[01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:14.040]  Well, no, they're just saying Liberty Dollars may be seized, Alex.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:21.102]  No, I know, but the way they've written it saying silver and gold coins are counterfeit, that could be expanded out into everything the way I read it.
[01:15:21.102 --> 01:15:21.742]  It's very dangerous.
[01:15:22.856 --> 01:15:31.650]  Well, I agree that it's dangerous, but they're not saying that gold and silver coins, because after all, the United States mint makes gold and silver coins.
[01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:36.237]  But they're saying your coins could be subject to seizure.
[01:15:36.237 --> 01:15:37.780]  That sets the precedent for all of them.
[01:15:39.337 --> 01:15:41.559]  Well, it's a dangerous slope.
[01:15:41.559 --> 01:15:43.221]  I forgive you that, Alex.
[01:15:43.221 --> 01:15:50.647]  But, you know, the Liberty Dollar was unique in its design, its mission, everything about the Liberty Dollar.
[01:15:50.647 --> 01:16:06.680]  And it was also unique that this article by CoinWorld came out at exactly the same time that I was actually in Charlotte appearing in court asking for an extension to find an attorney to represent me during my sentencing hearing.
[01:16:07.409 --> 01:16:10.050]  So, uh, boy, a lot of interesting things.
[01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:26.916]  The biggest part here, Alex, and the reason I say the government doesn't understand the implications of what they're saying is that when they raided Sunshine and they confiscated Liberty Dollars, they seized 170,000 ounces of silver.
[01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:31.517]  Now that's a shit pot full of silver, Alex.
[01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:32.798]  That's a lot of silver.
[01:16:32.798 --> 01:16:33.878]  But in reality,
[01:16:35.194 --> 01:16:54.030]  Because the vast majority of Liberty Dollar supporters did not trust the government and did not believe that the government wouldn't come in and seize the property, 90% of all Liberty Dollars were never...were in specie form.
[01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:56.793]  We filled people's orders.
[01:16:56.793 --> 01:16:59.475]  So that means that the 170,000 that they seized is only 10%
[01:17:03.258 --> 01:17:13.646]  Okay, and the vast majority of the 1.7 million Liberty Dollars are out there in circulation in millions of people's hands.
[01:17:13.646 --> 01:17:15.748]  I mean, this is widely distributed.
[01:17:15.748 --> 01:17:16.949]  When you think about 1.7 million ounces,
[01:17:19.142 --> 01:17:19.302]  We're
[01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:37.834]  Liberty dollars that are out there floating around.
[01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:43.940]  So if they're going to go out there and start trying to collect that, wow, they're really going to have their job cut out for them.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.101]  Well, you know, they don't care.
[01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:47.083]  They don't have to arrest every Amish farmer.
[01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.345]  They don't have to arrest every Lemon State owner.
[01:17:49.345 --> 01:17:49.686]  They like them.
[01:17:51.354 --> 01:18:00.263]  Again, it's about doing brazen, crazy things to just get us to accept that, well, my pimp beats me, he puts cigarettes out on me.
[01:18:00.263 --> 01:18:04.487]  I mean, this is about exercising their will on us.
[01:18:04.487 --> 01:18:06.790]  This is about hiking their leg on us.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:15.323]  Well, I certainly agree with you there, Alex, that they're using gross, intimidating tactics, okay?
[01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:26.389]  But the thing is, what they're already doing is driving the price of Liberty Dollars even higher than what they were on eBay and other different sites that handle Liberty Dollars.
[01:18:26.389 --> 01:18:37.274]  I got a report from one of our supporters who said that he saw a one-ounce topper on eBay for $70, for Pete's sakes, Alex!
[01:18:38.604 --> 01:18:41.890]  It's astronomical what Liberty Dollars are going for.
[01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:47.318]  And we were just trying to help the government find their way to issue a value-based currency.
[01:18:47.318 --> 01:18:52.868]  Well, my question is, if they say you're counterfeiting, are they going to go after the seven states that are starting to issue silver?
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:00.725]  Well, the states have a long ways to go before they get to that point, to be honest with you, Alex.
[01:19:00.725 --> 01:19:11.074]  And if Nevada's any example, when they took it to the Attorney General, when the state's people in Nevada took it to their Attorney General,
[01:19:11.514 --> 01:19:17.899]  He immediately pooh-poohed the whole thing, and it suddenly died.
[01:19:17.899 --> 01:19:26.845]  Yes, there's a lot of rhetoric about states' rights issuing something like this, but states cannot issue any gold and silver coins.
[01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:30.047]  They're specifically barred from that from the Constitution.
[01:19:30.047 --> 01:19:32.008]  Now, could they go to a third party?
[01:19:32.008 --> 01:19:34.150]  Could they allow a different currency to be used?
[01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:38.373]  Could they accept a gold and silver currency to be used to pay taxes?
[01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:39.334]  Yes, they could do that.
[01:19:40.134 --> 01:19:44.839]  After all, they are using those granted depreciating Federal Reserve notes.
[01:19:44.839 --> 01:19:46.120]  Bernard Vaughn, Note House.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:46.500]  Stay there.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.444]  I want to come back and talk about your case and why they went after you.
[01:19:50.444 --> 01:19:53.247]  Well, because you were successful at educating people.
[01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:55.729]  You're a political prisoner in waiting.
[01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:56.190]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.252 --> 01:20:04.813]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:20:04.813 --> 01:20:10.814]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:20:10.814 --> 01:20:11.454]  Why?
[01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:15.795]  When you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.
[01:20:15.795 --> 01:20:26.858]  With Le Cig e-cigarettes revolutionary microelectronic technology, rechargeable battery, and unique replacement cartridges, you'll get all the satisfaction of smoking, but no smoking hazards.

[01:20:38.966 --> 01:20:40.588]  That's 870-518-4307.
[01:20:40.588 --> 01:20:46.692]  LeCig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[01:20:46.692 --> 01:20:53.617]  Warning, e-cigs may contain nicotine, an addictive substance known to the state of California to cause birth defects or cancer.
[01:20:53.837 --> 01:20:57.320]  Please be aware of the risks associated with e-cigs prior to use.

[01:21:00.402 --> 01:21:02.924]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:08.249]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:21:08.249 --> 01:21:18.517]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:21:18.737 --> 01:21:20.057]  Forget loan modification.

[01:21:26.419 --> 01:21:31.861]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.

[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:12.805]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:22:12.805 --> 01:22:15.087]  Number one, study the past.
[01:22:15.087 --> 01:22:17.489]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:22:17.489 --> 01:22:21.192]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:22:22.324 --> 01:22:25.407]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:29.250]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:38.317]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:22:38.317 --> 01:22:41.720]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.

[01:22:59.946 --> 01:23:01.989]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[01:23:01.989 --> 01:23:04.151]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.

[01:23:56.672 --> 01:23:57.253]  Fight for it.
[01:23:57.253 --> 01:23:59.415]  Go to WaterWebinar.com now.
[01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:22.914]  Well, the founder of the Liberty Dollar, the Royal Hawaiian Mint, you name it, Bernard Vaughn Note House is our guest.
[01:24:24.346 --> 01:24:27.149]  What do you think of the way that this blew up in their face?
[01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:36.218]  I mean, even mainstream media said it was crazy that you were convicted for minting silver and gold coins and criticizing the Federal Reserve.
[01:24:36.218 --> 01:24:42.965]  I mean, you clearly were not masquerading as their masquerading counterfeit currency.
[01:24:44.448 --> 01:24:46.329]  Well, that's an understatement, Alex.
[01:24:46.329 --> 01:24:48.149]  I've certainly not been masquerading.
[01:24:48.149 --> 01:25:00.013]  You know, I was on tour for 12 years speaking all across the United States at a lot of different events in terms of providing a solution to the government.
[01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:05.554]  I thought that we were being helpful to the government because obviously they'd lost their way.
[01:25:05.554 --> 01:25:10.976]  They had their head up in a dark, foul place and that they needed some assistance.
[01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:15.479]  I thought the Liberty Dollar was going to be well-received.
[01:25:15.479 --> 01:25:24.345]  Actually, Alex, to be honest with you, it was very well-received by the government for the first, let's see, seven or eight years.
[01:25:24.345 --> 01:25:31.069]  I mean, a lot of prominent government officials replied to the government that the Liberty Dollar was legal.
[01:25:31.069 --> 01:25:36.853]  I appeared on the Learning Channel special along with the Federal Reserve and U.S.
[01:25:36.853 --> 01:25:38.915]  Mint and the Department of Bureau and Printing.
[01:25:39.735 --> 01:26:05.006]  And so, I mean, it was no secret about what I was doing, Alex, but evidently they really got their nose out of joint somewhere between April the 18th, when CoinWorld ran an article saying that Library dollars were illegal to collect, and that came directly from the Department of Treasury until, like, yesterday when they issued that new
[01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:36.799]  So it looks like they're trying to get their federal regulations in line with your fake conviction, because now they realize, wow, we convicted somebody on something that isn't illegal, so they think, I guess retroactively, they can have the Treasury flip-flop and say, well, we said you could have these, but now you can't, and so you're convicted of something that wasn't yet their regulation.
[01:26:38.499 --> 01:26:42.421]  Yeah, I mean, you know, government flip-flopping is nothing new, Alex.
[01:26:42.421 --> 01:26:46.483]  You know, these are people that you can't trust.
[01:26:46.483 --> 01:26:50.245]  That's why we have these nice adjectives to describe our favorite government.
[01:26:50.245 --> 01:26:52.847]  You know, there's no doubt about that.
[01:26:52.847 --> 01:27:03.092]  But the thing is, is that they're putting a lot of people at risk right now because, as I mentioned, there's somewhere around two million Liberty Dollar pieces out there.
[01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:05.113]  And I'm not talking about the paper certificate.
[01:27:05.113 --> 01:27:06.094]  I'm just talking about
[01:27:06.814 --> 01:27:10.315]  In gold, silver, and platinum species form.
[01:27:10.315 --> 01:27:12.835]  So, I don't know where the government's going to go with this.
[01:27:12.835 --> 01:27:19.937]  The latest word in coin world when they contacted the Secret Service was, well, we'll get back to you in a few weeks.
[01:27:19.937 --> 01:27:23.938]  In other words, they're going to think, what the hell is going on here?
[01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:29.999]  And hopefully they'll come to their senses and they'll realize that there was nothing illegal about the Liberty Dollar.
[01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:42.773]  Well, the word is, because you also had the paper currency, redeemable in gold and silver and copper, that they wanted to raid and hope that you didn't have the reserves versus the paper you had out there.
[01:27:42.773 --> 01:27:44.434]  That's actually what the fellow reserve does.
[01:27:44.434 --> 01:27:47.736]  For every dollar gets put in the bank, they can loan out ten.
[01:27:47.736 --> 01:27:53.939]  But, unfortunately, you actually had the reserves and more, and so they had to make something else up on you.
[01:27:53.939 --> 01:27:55.840]  Where is all that gold and silver now?
[01:27:57.298 --> 01:28:01.342]  Well, we almost had the government bring that into court.
[01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:09.431]  Of course, we're talking about nine tons, Alex, of gold and silver, which is a huge pile.
[01:28:09.431 --> 01:28:16.378]  But unfortunately, when the judge found out that it's being stored in Texas, and we were in North Carolina,
[01:28:16.918 --> 01:28:24.100]  He said, well, that's a long ways to go just to see the big pile of gold and silver.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:28.181]  They talked about getting videos of it and this and that.
[01:28:28.181 --> 01:28:30.762]  That never materialized.
[01:28:30.762 --> 01:28:35.124]  But long and short of it is, Alex, yes, we did have 100% backing.
[01:28:35.124 --> 01:28:36.384]  We actually had more silver.
[01:28:36.864 --> 01:28:46.787]  They confiscated, oh, I don't know, 30 or 40 extra thousand ounces on top of the silver that they confiscated that are backing up the certificates.
[01:28:46.787 --> 01:28:49.248]  Now, remember, the certificates are not illegal.
[01:28:49.248 --> 01:28:56.570]  The government has acknowledged in writing, the United States has acknowledged in writing, that the certificates are not illegal.
[01:28:56.570 --> 01:29:06.213]  So, the people who have the certificates still have a bona fide claim, even after I go to jail or go to prison, a bona fide claim to recover
[01:29:07.094 --> 01:29:08.235]  I think so.
[01:29:27.054 --> 01:29:28.856]  All right, Bernard von Nothaus.
[01:29:28.856 --> 01:29:29.636]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:29.636 --> 01:29:32.279]  We look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[01:29:32.279 --> 01:29:38.524]  And when the history books are written, you'll be known as the Rosa Parks of monetary freedom and constitutional money.
[01:29:38.524 --> 01:29:39.645]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:39.645 --> 01:29:41.787]  Where did you get that phrase?
[01:29:41.787 --> 01:29:43.029]  I just said it.
[01:29:43.029 --> 01:29:44.210]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:46.011]  Ron Paul's coming up next.
[01:29:46.011 --> 01:29:47.032]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:29:47.032 --> 01:29:49.975]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.975 --> 01:29:51.376]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.376 --> 01:29:52.877]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:56.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.531 --> 01:30:05.194]  Already, 2011 is a record-breaking year for disasters.
[01:30:05.194 --> 01:30:07.335]  Your family is your most precious asset.
[01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:11.178]  Could you feed them in case of emergency, food shortage, or job loss?
[01:30:11.178 --> 01:30:14.320]  At eFoods, we offer delicious, ready-made meals.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:23.566]  Cheesy chicken and rice casserole, beef stroganoff, chili with dumplings, with the longest storable shelf life, and easily prepared in minutes by simply adding to boiling water.
[01:30:23.566 --> 01:30:25.668]  Get your six free meals by just paying a small
[01:30:25.868 --> 01:30:26.228]  I think so.
[01:30:45.612 --> 01:30:46.073]  I think so.
[01:31:01.704 --> 01:31:03.426]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.426 --> 01:31:08.732]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.732 --> 01:31:10.274]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.274 --> 01:31:19.044]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.785 --> 01:31:27.330]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:35.335]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.335 --> 01:31:42.719]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:32:04.408 --> 01:32:05.669]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:09.211]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.211 --> 01:32:11.833]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.833 --> 01:32:17.697]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.697 --> 01:32:23.941]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.361 --> 01:32:30.346]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.346 --> 01:32:34.529]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.529 --> 01:32:38.812]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.812 --> 01:32:44.756]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.756 --> 01:32:48.319]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.319 --> 01:32:50.280]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:50.721]  It's here.

[01:32:59.894 --> 01:33:04.982]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:13.760]  Well, he's the hardest working statesman we've got up there at the federal government level.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.044]  And, of course, Congressman Ron Paul is one of the few statesmen we've got.
[01:33:18.044 --> 01:33:21.467]  And we've only got him for 15 minutes, so let's get right into it.
[01:33:21.467 --> 01:33:30.795]  Congressman, what do you make of the super-Congress and the fact that Congress was not able to even be involved in the Libya operation?
[01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:34.959]  Well, of course, to me it's an outrage.
[01:33:34.959 --> 01:33:48.228]  First, the Super Congress is some newfangled invention by the people who couldn't solve the problems up there and weren't willing to cut anything, so they're just going to pick 12 people who are supposed to, you know, pick out the things to really cut.
[01:33:49.697 --> 01:33:58.040]  No confidence that they'll achieve anything, and even if they did, it'd be risky, because why should we turn the whole Congress over to 12 individuals to make these decisions?
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.401]  So, I don't anticipate that they're going to come up with a solution.
[01:34:03.401 --> 01:34:10.904]  If they did, they'll probably be raising taxes, and they probably won't cut any money away from some of this militarism going on.
[01:34:10.904 --> 01:34:17.966]  They haven't even been brave enough to cut the money from Libya, so I don't expect a whole lot to happen from that super Congress.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:26.463]  Congressman, is there any recourse with Obama telling Congress, I don't need your authority to go to war in Libya.
[01:34:26.463 --> 01:34:31.525]  I have the UN giving me the authority and I quote, do this for their credibility.
[01:34:31.525 --> 01:34:34.586]  I mean, are we just going to, I guess, sit here collectively?
[01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:41.589]  I mean, I know you've been fighting it and just allow the power of the purse and the power of war to more and more move to the executive.
[01:34:42.685 --> 01:34:54.399]  I'm afraid that people aren't going to demand it, and the Congress won't respond, and there's a few of us, you know, that filed suit, and we try to fight it and vote against the funding, but we never get the majority.
[01:34:56.027 --> 01:34:57.428]  It's not like it's brand new.
[01:34:57.428 --> 01:35:01.851]  I know this is an outrage, but it's pretty much what's been going on since Truman.
[01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:07.074]  Truman actually did that on Korea, and of course we still are spending money on Korea.
[01:35:07.074 --> 01:35:12.457]  At times, a president would come and get token approval.
[01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:14.618]  They never get a declaration of war.
[01:35:14.618 --> 01:35:16.500]  It's just a token approval to do what I want.
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.422]  If I want to fight a war, I can, and Congress is expected to finance it.
[01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:38.804]  So, we've given up a lot over the last hundred years, and I think the responsibility of the Congress to be the final decision-maker on going to war, that's been long gone lost, but that's one of the things we've all been fighting for, is try to restore that principle to our country.
[01:35:40.097 --> 01:35:45.419]  Recently, shifting into monetary issues, you had Bernanke on the hot seat.
[01:35:45.419 --> 01:35:46.519]  You said, is gold money?
[01:35:46.519 --> 01:35:48.200]  And he said, no, it's not.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.020]  Their counterfeit Federal Reserve notes are.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:58.563]  Now we've seen, two weeks ago on Meet the Press, the former head of the Federal Reserve, Greenspan, I'm sure you saw it, say, hey, we're not going to default.
[01:35:58.563 --> 01:35:59.483]  We'll just print money.
[01:35:59.483 --> 01:36:01.584]  But isn't that a form of default?
[01:36:01.584 --> 01:36:07.926]  That's that inflation tax you've been talking about and another way of cheating people that have bought the Treasuries.
[01:36:08.626 --> 01:36:08.726]  Yes.
[01:36:18.101 --> 01:36:21.884]  Once a country gets this indebted, they never pay their bills.
[01:36:21.884 --> 01:36:23.745]  They can't work their way out.
[01:36:23.745 --> 01:36:30.029]  Theoretically, we could, you know, if we did all the things necessary, but in reality, countries don't.
[01:36:30.029 --> 01:36:38.815]  And especially if you end up over 40% of the money you need to operate, if you have to borrow it, it's at a point almost of no return.
[01:36:39.531 --> 01:36:43.155]  So they have to liquidate the debt.
[01:36:43.155 --> 01:36:53.205]  First, they won't admit we're in bankruptcy because they've been able to pawn it off to the American taxpayers by raising taxes and inflating the currency and borrowing around the world.
[01:36:53.205 --> 01:36:54.486]  But we literally are bankrupt.
[01:36:55.507 --> 01:37:06.374]  So, the debt has to be liquidated, and it is true, we won't default on the debt in the sense that they won't pay off the holders of bonds.
[01:37:06.374 --> 01:37:12.378]  They'll always be paid off, just like the holders of the obligations for Social Security will always send a check.
[01:37:12.378 --> 01:37:16.321]  But what they don't have control on is the value of that money they sent.
[01:37:16.321 --> 01:37:22.345]  Matter of fact, it is a deliberate policy of the Fed, and Bernanke has essentially admitted this.
[01:37:22.965 --> 01:37:24.146]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:47.182]  Uh, in purchasing power, your real debt goes down 50%.
[01:37:47.182 --> 01:37:53.686]  So 50% inflation, which they're liable to get, the real debt goes from 14 down to 7.
[01:37:53.686 --> 01:37:57.408]  But the real problem is, is everybody doesn't suffer equally.
[01:37:57.408 --> 01:37:58.588]  Some people suffer more.
[01:37:58.588 --> 01:38:00.129]  Some people actually benefit.
[01:38:00.129 --> 01:38:03.031]  And the middle class generally gets wiped out.
[01:38:03.031 --> 01:38:04.712]  And if they want to aim for 5, 10, or 15, or 30% inflation,
[01:38:07.833 --> 01:38:08.013]  I don't
[01:38:26.341 --> 01:38:29.223]  And they say Ron Paul's on a mission, he's certainly educating people.
[01:38:29.223 --> 01:38:38.989]  So at least they're admitting that you are in a war of ideas, and that you're trying to change the course of history, and I would say successfully doing that, win, lose, or draw.
[01:38:38.989 --> 01:38:50.176]  But getting some into the campaign, even when you were on Neil Cavuto yesterday or a few days ago, I saw it on YouTube last night, not sure when, he kept saying, too bad you can't win, I sure love you, too bad you can't win.
[01:38:50.176 --> 01:38:51.417]  So it was kind of a back
[01:38:52.137 --> 01:38:53.638]  Slap in a smiley way.
[01:38:53.638 --> 01:38:55.259]  I'm not attacking Cavuto.
[01:38:55.259 --> 01:39:12.067]  But the issue is, in every poll I've seen, I watch it, you've been number one, number two, or number three for the last six months, and you win the New Hampshire straw poll, you get a technical tie, even when they're buying the votes in Iowa, and they put out this hoax that you can't win.
[01:39:12.067 --> 01:39:14.929]  But then, meanwhile, and this is what I want you to speak to,
[01:39:16.121 --> 01:39:20.024]  You've got Romney, who's the Obamacare author, his model.
[01:39:20.024 --> 01:39:34.537]  It's now come out that not only was Perry the campaign manager in Texas for Gore, but that now we learn in 93 he gave speeches and wrote letters endorsing Hillarycare, worse than Obamacare, and forced Gardasil shots, sir.
[01:39:34.537 --> 01:39:42.864]  So I know you're a gentleman, but it all hinges, in my political opinion, you can correct me if I'm wrong, you have much greater gravitas than I, on you
[01:39:43.504 --> 01:39:50.289]  Going after these people because they are basically like Obama, but they look more like Ronald Reagan.
[01:39:50.289 --> 01:39:58.576]  I mean, what do you say about these two establishment hacks that the system is exalting as our, you know, as our new leader?
[01:39:59.622 --> 01:40:06.024]  But generally, over the years, I've allowed their policies to speak for themselves, and their policies are now failing wholesale.
[01:40:06.024 --> 01:40:18.349]  That's why our voice is growing in strength and credibility, because everything they say and do and advocate is a total failure, whether it's the war they fight or the printing of the money or running up these debts.
[01:40:19.089 --> 01:40:28.078]  And all these proposals for the bureaucracy, I mean, just think of the size of government over the last, the growth of the government over these last 50 years, it's been horrendous.
[01:40:28.078 --> 01:40:42.752]  So I think that is such glaring evidence that you all, I don't, you know, I don't rally the thought of just really accusing them of all sorts of things, because they're all to blame, and it's bigger than one person.
[01:40:43.012 --> 01:40:48.775]  I understand, but those are the guys that they're selling, your voters, mainline Republicans, Libertarians, Conservatives.
[01:40:48.775 --> 01:41:03.682]  I mean, Rick Perry has gone from doubling the size of the Texas government in 10 years to saying basically that he's, you know, I'm the real Ron Paul, I'm Rick Perry, and, you know, the Federal Reserve is almost treacherous or treasonous.
[01:41:03.682 --> 01:41:05.423]  I mean, he's trying to become you.
[01:41:05.423 --> 01:41:06.364]  So what do you say to that?
[01:41:07.469 --> 01:41:12.892]  Well, I think that people have to realize and look at his record, and when they look at his record, they know that he's a flip-flopper.
[01:41:12.892 --> 01:41:21.096]  I mean, how can what he say be much different than what Romney has done with his medical care system up in Massachusetts?
[01:41:21.096 --> 01:41:21.757]  And you're right.
[01:41:23.846 --> 01:41:27.330]  Barry has endorsed Hillary's program.
[01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:35.119]  But the American people, you know, I guess one reason why it seems so obvious to me, why does anybody even have to lecture people?
[01:41:35.119 --> 01:41:39.744]  Why don't they just wake up and look at history and investigate a little bit?
[01:41:39.744 --> 01:41:41.486]  But I think more and more is coming out.
[01:41:43.728 --> 01:41:58.074]  I think Perry is going to be a very, very informal politician and he may well walk off with it, but it's a sad state of affairs if the people don't wake up and look at their records.
[01:41:58.074 --> 01:42:05.156]  How can they be so happy about, like you said, he was the chairman for Al Gore in Texas in 1980.
[01:42:07.838 --> 01:42:13.623]  1988 handing Rhodes over to center of Spain, Bilderberg Group meetings, forced inoculations.
[01:42:13.623 --> 01:42:18.467]  I mean the fact is he's doing all this stuff now, not just in 93 praising Hillary.
[01:42:18.467 --> 01:42:21.489]  What person in their right mind would support Hillary care?
[01:42:21.489 --> 01:42:29.215]  I mean I was 18 years old when they were trying to ram through her, 17, and I knew it was bad when I was 17.
[01:42:29.215 --> 01:42:31.958]  So right there it shows he's got major judgment problems.
[01:42:33.171 --> 01:42:41.814]  People in Washington that I've known for years, and those generally who run for presidency, the only thing that motivates them is power.
[01:42:41.814 --> 01:42:48.576]  And it's not sound ideas, it's not freedom, and they're locked in on this power struggle.
[01:42:48.576 --> 01:42:51.017]  Both parties are this way.
[01:42:51.017 --> 01:42:56.219]  The parties pretend they're different, and they have different rhetoric, but regardless
[01:42:58.231 --> 01:42:58.552]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:17.293]  And that's why this is all going to come to an end.
[01:43:17.293 --> 01:43:21.495]  So the big question is, who's going to pick up the pieces now?
[01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:36.183]  And who's going to lead the charge away from the drift where we have gone to, you know, in the last, really, 100 years, whether it's foreign policy or monetary policy, IRS, and the Fed, and all these things have gone on for a long time.
[01:43:36.183 --> 01:43:37.584]  I think it's coming to an end.
[01:43:38.825 --> 01:43:45.112]  And that's why what we're doing now, all of us, you know, is so important.
[01:43:45.112 --> 01:43:48.956]  And I think their failures are going to speak for themselves.
[01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:55.363]  Their failures are shouting out very loud about how poorly their ideas are working.
[01:43:55.745 --> 01:43:59.450]  We've only got about four minutes left with you, sir, so I want to move quickly here.
[01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:04.157]  Obviously when you say he may well walk away with it, you are within striking distance.
[01:44:04.157 --> 01:44:11.027]  If we can just expose the hoax that is Rick Perry and then the other minion, Mitt Romney, you are going to have it, sir, and it's
[01:44:11.087 --> 01:44:11.847]  Perfect timing.
[01:44:11.847 --> 01:44:12.767]  You're the man of the hour.
[01:44:12.767 --> 01:44:19.429]  God has literally, you know, given you to us that you've been right all these years, never compromised, right as America's collapsing.
[01:44:19.429 --> 01:44:24.490]  Here you are with the constitutional, tried-and-true, common-sense solutions.
[01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:29.011]  But if you do lose, you still win by educating people.
[01:44:29.011 --> 01:44:37.333]  But you say that you're going to go home after this when your term is up, if you don't win the presidency.
[01:44:37.333 --> 01:44:40.514]  If you don't win the presidency and leave, sir, are you still going to write and speak?
[01:44:41.862 --> 01:44:43.764]  I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't do that.
[01:44:43.764 --> 01:44:53.093]  I've always thought that I've always done the same thing whether I'm in office or out of office or whatever and the goals have always been the same.
[01:44:53.093 --> 01:44:56.256]  The elected position has generally been secondary.
[01:44:56.656 --> 01:45:03.841]  But the one thing is, if you're in the business of trying to change the course of a country, you can do a much better job if you're in office.
[01:45:03.841 --> 01:45:13.127]  And obviously, as president, I can do a much better job than if I'm just looking for a format and wondering where I'll go next.
[01:45:13.127 --> 01:45:16.409]  So, no, it's more or less out of my hands.
[01:45:16.409 --> 01:45:19.311]  I just do what I have to do, and we'll see how things come out.
[01:45:19.719 --> 01:45:23.540]  So we'll still be able to have you pop in from time to time, even if you do retire.
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.501]  I'm going to be around.
[01:45:25.501 --> 01:45:26.681]  You are awesome, sir.
[01:45:26.681 --> 01:45:30.542]  Final questions here, because this is why I know you're so real.
[01:45:30.542 --> 01:45:34.624]  Not just that you don't compromise, and not just your perfect constitutional voting record.
[01:45:34.624 --> 01:45:35.924]  I hope everybody gets behind you.
[01:45:35.924 --> 01:45:38.705]  Campaign for Liberty as well, with all the other great candidates.
[01:45:39.225 --> 01:45:41.707]  Donate at RonPaul2012.com.
[01:45:41.707 --> 01:45:43.127]  Knock on doors.
[01:45:43.127 --> 01:45:45.008]  Get involved in your party precincts.
[01:45:45.008 --> 01:45:46.289]  Become a delegate.
[01:45:46.289 --> 01:45:49.651]  Ron Paul can win and will win if we get behind him.
[01:45:49.651 --> 01:45:52.553]  He's put his hat in the ring and is pouring his heart and soul out.
[01:45:52.553 --> 01:45:57.856]  It's up to us to get behind Ron Paul or wish later by gnashing our teeth that we would have.
[01:45:57.856 --> 01:46:01.618]  But sir, in closing, last year at a Campaign for Liberty event you talked about a coup
[01:46:01.698 --> 01:46:02.098]  We're good to go.
[01:46:14.526 --> 01:46:36.592]  Well, I imagine if you pin me down, the literal sense of what a coup generally is, probably not quite that, but for the CIA to really be running the show, I was referring to the CIA at the time, because it's so secretive, it's somewhat like the secrets of the Federal Reserve in finances, it's so hard to find out what's going on, but the CIA
[01:46:38.092 --> 01:46:38.773]  I don't think so.
[01:46:55.763 --> 01:47:07.831]  So therefore, it is totally secret that this is even out of the realm of what Obama does when he says, well, I'm going in and I'm just going to be with NATO and I'm going to start bombing Libya.
[01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:10.853]  I think this is very serious.
[01:47:10.853 --> 01:47:20.399]  And now we have the DOD person, Petraeus, going over to the CIA, and then the CIA head going over to the military.
[01:47:20.399 --> 01:47:22.520]  It's such a mixed deal.
[01:47:23.781 --> 01:47:29.346]  We don't know exactly what's happening, but I know the CIA has been involved in so many elections around the world.
[01:47:29.346 --> 01:47:31.148]  They pick and choose dictators, I'm sure.
[01:47:31.148 --> 01:47:40.836]  I don't think there's any doubt they're very much involved in these revolutions going on in the Mediterranean, and we're just out trying to pick dictators.
[01:47:40.836 --> 01:47:46.301]  I just don't like all this secrecy and government out of the control of the people who are responsible.
[01:47:47.486 --> 01:47:49.027]  Well, Congressman, we've got to let you go.
[01:47:49.027 --> 01:47:54.812]  I want to ask you one last question and just remind folks to get behind ronpaul2012.com.
[01:47:54.812 --> 01:48:00.256]  Speaking of FEMA, you've been criticized for saying we don't need FEMA, but all they do is confiscate guns at Katrina.
[01:48:00.256 --> 01:48:02.798]  That's really not the federal government's job, I guess.
[01:48:02.798 --> 01:48:08.782]  But you were asked by reporter Robert Wannick a few weeks ago in Iowa about the H.R.
[01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:12.645]  645 National Emergency Centers Establishment Act, and you said, yeah, that's their goal.
[01:48:12.645 --> 01:48:17.229]  They're setting up the stage for violence in this country, no doubt about it, responded
[01:48:17.549 --> 01:48:20.155]  Well, I'm not even sure I recall that exact conversation.
[01:48:27.242 --> 01:48:45.771]  But, you know, the FEMA is in charge of all emergencies, so whether it's a natural disaster or whatever, they're in charge of our land, they're land planners, they're economic planners, and they're planning for any provision.
[01:48:45.771 --> 01:48:50.713]  And I think the establishment, the people in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats,
[01:48:51.353 --> 01:48:52.494]  And they'd like that power grab!
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:14.841]  That's their goal.
[01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:16.022]  It's all about power.
[01:49:16.022 --> 01:49:17.903]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:49:17.903 --> 01:49:20.085]  RonPaul2012.com, sir.
[01:49:20.085 --> 01:49:22.046]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:49:22.046 --> 01:49:22.327]  Okay, Alex.
[01:49:22.327 --> 01:49:23.327]  Good to talk to you.
[01:49:23.327 --> 01:49:24.048]  Good to talk to you.
[01:49:24.048 --> 01:49:28.351]  There goes Congressman Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:28.351 --> 01:49:35.416]  And I always feel guilty when I call up and get him on the show, because I happen to know how hard he's working.
[01:49:35.416 --> 01:49:39.680]  But there he was, and that was definitely a powerful interview.
[01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:44.292]  Wow, that is the real deal.
[01:49:44.292 --> 01:49:46.714]  Perfect constitutional voting record.
[01:49:46.714 --> 01:49:47.735]  You claim you're an American?
[01:49:47.735 --> 01:49:49.417]  You claim you stand for America?
[01:49:49.417 --> 01:49:51.399]  That's it.
[01:49:51.399 --> 01:49:53.080]  In fact, I really have to agree.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:59.827]  I admire Ron Paul more than anybody else out there alive, unless you're talking about my dad or somebody or my grandpa's.
[01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:01.808]  But politically, he's it.
[01:50:01.808 --> 01:50:04.271]  And if you want founding father material, who was it?
[01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:05.052]  Lew Rockwell said.
[01:50:06.206 --> 01:50:10.729]  We haven't had something like this since the time of Jefferson.
[01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:12.651]  He has never compromised.
[01:50:12.651 --> 01:50:20.176]  He works 18 hours a day, admittedly sleeping less than six hours.
[01:50:20.176 --> 01:50:26.601]  He might take off, I've been told by a lot of folks that know him more than I, one and a half, maybe two days a month.
[01:50:27.461 --> 01:50:32.448]  All the rest of the time, stoic research, radio interviews.
[01:50:32.448 --> 01:50:35.192]  All he does is exercise for one hour in the morning.
[01:50:35.192 --> 01:50:37.395]  He doesn't even hardly eat anything.
[01:50:37.395 --> 01:50:40.359]  I've been at events with Ron Pauls.
[01:50:40.359 --> 01:50:40.980]  He doesn't eat!
[01:50:42.413 --> 01:50:46.416]  He barely sleeps, and you can see it in his face.
[01:50:46.416 --> 01:50:47.998]  You gotta pray for that guy.
[01:50:47.998 --> 01:50:51.861]  That's why he gets demonized and attacked, and the COINTELPRO says he's not real.
[01:50:51.861 --> 01:50:52.841]  You're not real.
[01:50:52.841 --> 01:50:53.962]  You're scum.
[01:50:53.962 --> 01:50:54.643]  You're filth.
[01:50:54.643 --> 01:50:56.004]  You work for the globalists.
[01:50:56.004 --> 01:50:56.744]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:56.744 --> 01:50:57.225]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.992 --> 01:51:07.715]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[01:51:07.715 --> 01:51:11.878]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[01:51:11.878 --> 01:51:17.621]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[01:51:17.621 --> 01:51:22.244]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromise
[01:51:22.244 --> 01:51:22.744]  We're good to go!
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:53.489]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[01:51:53.489 --> 01:51:56.673]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[01:51:56.673 --> 01:51:58.635]  That's survivalrx.com.
[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:05.063]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:52:05.063 --> 01:52:06.563]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:52:06.563 --> 01:52:15.468]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:52:15.468 --> 01:52:18.890]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:19.791]  But take heart.
[01:52:19.791 --> 01:52:23.733]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:52:23.733 --> 01:52:28.716]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:52:29.136 --> 01:52:32.977]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:52:32.977 --> 01:52:34.697]  The globalists are scared.
[01:52:34.697 --> 01:52:36.037]  They've overreached.
[01:52:36.037 --> 01:52:39.538]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[01:52:39.538 --> 01:52:41.799]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:52:54.922 --> 01:52:57.022]  We are going to use their system against them.
[01:52:57.182 --> 01:53:00.747]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear!
[01:53:00.747 --> 01:53:04.372]  OpticsPlanet is calling all hunters, shooters, and outdoorsmen.
[01:53:04.372 --> 01:53:05.693]  It's time to gear up.

[01:53:56.884 --> 01:53:56.924]  800-332-6784.
[01:54:09.065 --> 01:54:14.288]  I just learned something during the break with one of the guys back there in the shipping office.
[01:54:14.288 --> 01:54:18.951]  His parents live in Lake Jackson, three doors down from the Falls.
[01:54:21.010 --> 01:54:26.432]  It's one of those subdivisions slash rural areas backing up on folks' little pieces of property.
[01:54:26.432 --> 01:54:34.316]  And he says he was out there, I think he said just a few weeks ago, and it was 100-something degrees.
[01:54:34.316 --> 01:54:39.898]  And there's Ron Paul mowing the yard and doing stuff in the garden and everything.
[01:54:39.898 --> 01:54:44.620]  He's just a regular guy who milked cows and then, of course, had to milk around.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.822]  He's a little kid, got up every day at 3.30 in the morning and went and did it.
[01:54:48.583 --> 01:54:51.316]  And he's just old line America.
[01:54:51.316 --> 01:54:52.099]  What's left of it.
[01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:59.716]  And a doctor, so disciplined, dedicated, knowing there's a mission, literally pouring out his whole essence.
[01:54:59.716 --> 01:55:03.278]  Guys, will you pull up the Teddy Roosevelt quote?
[01:55:03.278 --> 01:55:05.619]  Teddy Roosevelt quote in the arena.
[01:55:05.619 --> 01:55:09.181]  And then put it on screen, I want to read that on air.
[01:55:09.181 --> 01:55:16.365]  It doesn't matter about the critics, people that never actually do anything and just sit back and throw stones, people like Ron Paul.
[01:55:16.365 --> 01:55:18.246]  What matters is the man in the arena.
[01:55:19.150 --> 01:55:25.515]  And you may not win every time, but as long as you're doing right, in the end, you'll be an example to others who are going to win.
[01:55:25.515 --> 01:55:29.598]  And it doesn't matter one way or the other, Ron Paul, win, loses, or draws.
[01:55:29.598 --> 01:55:34.702]  If he wins, we probably get this country back faster.
[01:55:34.702 --> 01:55:38.906]  But if he loses, the ideas are there, and ideas are bulletproof.
[01:55:40.427 --> 01:55:42.068]  And it's called The Man in the Arena.
[01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:50.255]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[01:55:50.255 --> 01:56:03.667]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errors, and whose shortcomings
[01:56:05.188 --> 01:56:06.469]  Come short again and again.
[01:56:06.469 --> 01:56:08.549]  It's so far away I can't read it.
[01:56:08.549 --> 01:56:09.950]  We'll just print it later and I'll read it.
[01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:12.931]  Again, I'm going to try it again.
[01:56:12.931 --> 01:56:13.411]  Here we go.
[01:56:13.411 --> 01:56:22.875]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, like I just did, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:28.257]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.
[01:56:29.329 --> 01:56:56.138]  Who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.
[01:56:57.156 --> 01:57:04.678]  So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
[01:57:04.678 --> 01:57:07.038]  Thanks for putting that on the screen for me, guys.
[01:57:07.038 --> 01:57:11.119]  Listen, I know I'm standing up for what's right.
[01:57:11.119 --> 01:57:14.079]  I know my nightly news show isn't going to be as slick as other people's.
[01:57:14.079 --> 01:57:14.660]  I don't care.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:16.300]  It's the information.
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:21.141]  I know I'm not the best looking talk show host in the world.
[01:57:21.966 --> 01:57:29.738]  I know I'm not even the most eloquent, but I know basic principles of liberty and I'm a fighter and I'm not backing down, I'm committed.
[01:57:29.738 --> 01:57:31.781]  And there's a good feeling in being fearless.
[01:57:33.871 --> 01:57:36.953]  I'm not writing my family off from danger from the government.
[01:57:36.953 --> 01:57:41.295]  I realize they have no future if I don't commit them and everything else I am to the fight for liberty.
[01:57:41.295 --> 01:57:42.796]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:57:42.796 --> 01:57:44.357]  So they do have a chance.
[01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:46.238]  I've got to commit everything.
[01:57:46.238 --> 01:57:47.218]  And it's that attitude.
[01:57:47.218 --> 01:57:51.681]  And Ron Paul, I'm 37 years old and I know his schedule.
[01:57:51.681 --> 01:57:56.203]  I work 70% as much as he does.
[01:57:56.203 --> 01:58:02.207]  He's 76 years old and he works like a
[01:58:04.639 --> 01:58:10.165]  He's a tireless slave to liberty.
[01:58:10.165 --> 01:58:13.408]  I mean, I don't know how you describe it.
[01:58:13.408 --> 01:58:19.935]  And he's not perfect, but he's the best thing we've seen in a generation.
[01:58:19.935 --> 01:58:21.997]  Get behind Ron Paul.
[01:58:21.997 --> 01:58:22.878]  I got all this news.
[01:58:22.878 --> 01:58:24.180]  I want to get to your calls.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:26.082]  Don't forget the TV show launches tomorrow night.
[01:58:27.125 --> 01:58:27.405]  9-1-11.

[01:58:37.256 --> 01:58:41.440]  Information is power.

[01:58:57.895 --> 01:59:03.037]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:03.037 --> 01:59:11.761]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.761 --> 01:59:15.822]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:15.822 --> 01:59:17.783]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:20.117 --> 01:59:24.840]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:28.683]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:59:28.683 --> 01:59:29.904]  Others don't.
[01:59:29.904 --> 01:59:32.065]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:59:32.065 --> 01:59:33.847]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:59:48.437 --> 01:59:49.298]  Others don't.
[01:59:53.829 --> 01:59:56.211]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.211 --> 02:00:05.557]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.557 --> 02:00:06.858]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.858 --> 02:00:08.639]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.639 --> 02:00:10.401]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.401 --> 02:00:11.982]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.982 --> 02:00:13.523]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.523 --> 02:00:17.726]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.726 --> 02:00:21.829]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.102 --> 02:00:39.385]  Okay, it's hour number three.
[02:00:40.678 --> 02:00:42.199]  Our Trace!
[02:00:42.199 --> 02:00:43.901]  I gotta know some Spanish.
[02:00:43.901 --> 02:00:45.642]  Impress people.
[02:00:45.642 --> 02:00:46.643]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:46.643 --> 02:00:47.444]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:47.444 --> 02:00:55.450]  What'd you think of the Liberty Dollar note house interview?
[02:00:55.450 --> 02:00:57.552]  What'd you think of the Colonel Schaefer?
[02:00:57.552 --> 02:01:03.076]  Not being able to disagree that it's high treason that Obama's launching wars without congressional approval and saying he's under U.N.
[02:01:03.076 --> 02:01:03.417]  control.
[02:01:05.495 --> 02:01:10.899]  It's not really treason if you always work for the group, but side issue.
[02:01:10.899 --> 02:01:12.381]  All of this is part of the globalist plan.
[02:01:12.381 --> 02:01:17.385]  That's why our quote government helped create the UN to later transfer our power to it.
[02:01:17.385 --> 02:01:18.786]  The traitors inside created it.
[02:01:19.824 --> 02:01:23.266]  So they can burn the ship of liberty and move us over to the ship of tyranny.
[02:01:23.266 --> 02:01:24.647]  I'm not getting on board.
[02:01:24.647 --> 02:01:26.449]  And they're trying to drill holes in this ship.
[02:01:26.449 --> 02:01:27.810]  I'm trying to clog them.
[02:01:27.810 --> 02:01:31.212]  I'm trying to fix the leaks here, and I hope you'll join me.
[02:01:31.212 --> 02:01:33.754]  It's easy to sit back and go, oh, we'll never fix this.
[02:01:33.754 --> 02:01:35.675]  Well, you know where we're going if we don't?
[02:01:35.675 --> 02:01:39.038]  I mean, it's kind of like when you're getting mugged.
[02:01:39.038 --> 02:01:46.003]  I mean, you're either going to give them your wallet, let them beat you up and laugh at you, or you're going to open a can of, you know, good old boy guts and stomp them in the ground.
[02:01:47.981 --> 02:01:49.922]  And that's how it is politically and in life.
[02:01:49.922 --> 02:01:54.144]  It's just a lot better to not get in the ground and lick boots.
[02:01:54.144 --> 02:01:57.666]  I mean, it's like, you may beat me in the end, but you know what?
[02:01:57.666 --> 02:01:59.887]  I'm gonna bite your feet.
[02:01:59.887 --> 02:02:03.929]  That is not a radical, courage-filled angle.
[02:02:03.929 --> 02:02:06.050]  That's normal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.810]  I've told you this.
[02:02:06.810 --> 02:02:10.152]  Look, a squirrel at your corner, it'll attack you and fight like the devil.
[02:02:10.152 --> 02:02:12.593]  A raccoon will probably beat you.
[02:02:12.593 --> 02:02:15.475]  The smallest chimpanzee will beat the biggest UFC fighter.
[02:02:16.445 --> 02:02:16.865]  You know why?
[02:02:16.865 --> 02:02:18.887]  Because they're not looking for trouble, folks.
[02:02:18.887 --> 02:02:21.830]  But you corner one, they don't have a governor.
[02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:26.294]  They will turn it loose and tear your face off.
[02:02:26.294 --> 02:02:34.361]  And we've got to politically get into that area of our guts and our mind where we don't play games anymore.
[02:02:34.361 --> 02:02:38.504]  Where we're not afraid to tell it like it is and come right out with it.
[02:02:38.504 --> 02:02:43.629]  The time for playing games and holding back what we say and what we believe is over.
[02:02:44.565 --> 02:02:49.467]  Old timers, oh those old timers, or get off my land and don't trust the government, they're backwards.
[02:02:49.467 --> 02:02:52.348]  No, they weren't backwards, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:52.348 --> 02:02:59.211]  They lived in the real world and came from people that lived in the real world, where if you made mistakes, you didn't live.
[02:02:59.211 --> 02:03:09.834]  It's this modern society with all its great attributes, at the end of the day, in the final equation, when the curtain falls, makes us weak.
[02:03:09.834 --> 02:03:11.835]  And it makes us like lambs of the slaughter.
[02:03:11.835 --> 02:03:13.556]  The complexity of society.
[02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:23.171]  The complexity of civilization is something that tyrants can hide behind.
[02:03:23.171 --> 02:03:28.914]  It's something that evil can live under, like roaches.
[02:03:28.914 --> 02:03:35.498]  And now the roaches feel so powerful, they're telling us get out of our house, or to shine their little roach feet.
[02:03:35.498 --> 02:03:37.299]  I'm not doing it.
[02:03:37.299 --> 02:03:38.219]  Okay?
[02:03:38.219 --> 02:03:39.700]  And I've got some news I'm going to cover.
[02:03:40.814 --> 02:03:56.930]  When we come back, briefly, as fast as I can, A, on all over the country, a phenomenon that really illustrates just how dire our straits are, the police arresting people that film them at city council meetings and on street corners.
[02:03:56.930 --> 02:03:59.873]  And one guy's facing life in prison.
[02:03:59.873 --> 02:04:03.116]  I've seen charges where it's 15 years, 20 years, and thought it was bad.
[02:04:03.116 --> 02:04:05.198]  This guy's facing life in prison.
[02:04:06.325 --> 02:04:20.542]  And the article said 75, but actually I looked at the charges and other news reports, life, it did, you know, he's 40-somethings, they estimate, you know, he's 40, they estimate he'll, uh, you know, die, so they're saying 75 on the, uh, life in prison.
[02:04:20.542 --> 02:04:24.546]  Uh, and they admit in the newscast, you know, the, uh, the newscaster really believes
[02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:32.577]  Or maybe he's lying to people, but I think the guy looks like, you know, he's a mainline person, doesn't even know which end is up, that you don't film police.
[02:04:32.577 --> 02:04:41.185]  But the fact that the cops know the law, and they know that they're going and bamboozling the juries to send innocent people to prison.
[02:04:41.185 --> 02:04:44.428]  Let me tell you, you're dealing with some real criminals.
[02:04:44.428 --> 02:04:46.850]  And this guy shouldn't just have the charges dropped.
[02:04:48.089 --> 02:04:51.575]  All the people that file them are criminals.
[02:04:51.575 --> 02:04:53.678]  The criminals need to be brought to justice.
[02:04:53.678 --> 02:04:55.582]  Nothing worse than government oppressing people.
[02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:05.332]  Already, 2011 is a record-breaking year for disasters.
[02:05:05.332 --> 02:05:07.453]  Your family is your most precious asset.

[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:20.743]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:07:06.499 --> 02:07:12.926]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:07:12.926 --> 02:07:15.208]  Number one, study the past.
[02:07:15.208 --> 02:07:17.610]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:21.333]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:07:22.443 --> 02:07:25.526]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:07:25.526 --> 02:07:29.389]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:07:29.389 --> 02:07:34.433]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:07:34.433 --> 02:07:38.436]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:07:38.436 --> 02:07:41.839]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.

[02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:10.556]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.556 --> 02:08:12.137]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.137 --> 02:08:13.679]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.679 --> 02:08:17.882]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.882 --> 02:08:21.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.025 --> 02:08:47.807]  We are back live now into the third and final hour today.
[02:08:47.807 --> 02:08:51.349]  We're going to go to your phone calls coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:08:51.349 --> 02:09:03.073]  But first, I want to get to our report today by Paul Joseph Watson that is also linked at DrudgeReport.com in the middle column.
[02:09:03.073 --> 02:09:06.535]  Man faces life in jail for recording police.
[02:09:08.945 --> 02:09:15.147]  This article is so important that I, again, do not have words to describe it.
[02:09:15.147 --> 02:09:19.848]  So, I hope that everyone is listening very, very carefully to me.
[02:09:19.848 --> 02:09:23.609]  Please, listen to me.
[02:09:23.609 --> 02:09:30.412]  When you see an article like this, you automatically, even if you don't know the law, say, that sounds crazy.
[02:09:30.412 --> 02:09:33.272]  So then you read deeper.
[02:09:33.272 --> 02:09:35.053]  The man filmed police in public.
[02:09:38.932 --> 02:09:43.436]  And you know that there's no perception of privacy in public.
[02:09:43.436 --> 02:09:45.919]  That's how the government videotapes us with cameras.
[02:09:45.919 --> 02:09:48.341]  That's how the police have squad car cameras.
[02:09:48.341 --> 02:09:55.888]  That's how police, most police, wear microphones or even small cameras on their ties or on their shirt.
[02:09:55.888 --> 02:09:57.909]  Is it wiretapping when they come up to you?
[02:09:59.122 --> 02:10:05.605]  Is it wiretapping when you're at the beach and shoot some video that's recording audio of people walking down the beach?
[02:10:05.605 --> 02:10:06.465]  No!
[02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:09.467]  You're in a public place!
[02:10:09.467 --> 02:10:15.069]  When you see tourists videotaping down a street, do you run over and say, I'm calling the police?
[02:10:15.069 --> 02:10:16.370]  You're wiretapping?
[02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:17.851]  No!
[02:10:17.851 --> 02:10:19.191]  The answer is no!
[02:10:19.191 --> 02:10:27.035]  And I've read these wiretapping statutes in the 12 states where they are arresting and convicting people.
[02:10:29.298 --> 02:10:32.819]  In most cases, it gets thrown out, or it gets thrown out on appeal.
[02:10:32.819 --> 02:10:40.202]  But the point is, they are convicting people when it's not a wiretapping statute.
[02:10:40.202 --> 02:10:47.626]  The statute is in a private place, recording someone without their consent.
[02:10:47.626 --> 02:10:55.509]  And normally, it's mafia-run areas like Connecticut, New York, Illinois, where they do not want people to be able to tape them.
[02:10:55.509 --> 02:10:58.170]  They don't want to be caught in all of their corruption.
[02:11:00.017 --> 02:11:09.839]  Now, from Maryland to Illinois, all over the place, every day now, I see articles where people are being arrested.
[02:11:09.839 --> 02:11:14.000]  I saw a case in Maryland where the guy's 200 yards away, police are beating people.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:25.523]  The police march over, beat him, and take him to jail, and charge him, and he was facing felony wiretapping.
[02:11:25.523 --> 02:11:25.703]  Now,
[02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:33.658]  It got thrown out of court later, but the point is they were trying to put that guy in jail.
[02:11:33.658 --> 02:11:37.261]  I see cases now where people have surveillance on their own business or home.
[02:11:37.261 --> 02:11:40.784]  Cops come for whatever reason, you go to jail because you have a camera.
[02:11:40.784 --> 02:11:44.787]  I've seen cases where citizens videotape other citizens.
[02:11:44.787 --> 02:11:49.831]  In one case, in a town where the police give citizens radar guns, they videotaped that.
[02:11:49.831 --> 02:11:54.275]  The cops came on the people's property and arrested them for wiretapping.
[02:11:54.875 --> 02:11:56.558]  So, I know you've seen it in your newspaper.
[02:11:56.558 --> 02:11:58.101]  It's happening in 12 states.
[02:12:00.734 --> 02:12:05.459]  And those 12 states have very evil police.
[02:12:05.459 --> 02:12:07.080]  Does that mean all of them are evil?
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:07.721]  No.
[02:12:07.721 --> 02:12:14.067]  But the prosecutors, the bosses, the police chiefs are extremely evil.
[02:12:14.067 --> 02:12:16.969]  It is beyond Soviet tyranny.
[02:12:16.969 --> 02:12:25.658]  In the Soviet Union, if you were somebody caught with a camera or something, just in general public, most people were allowed to have cameras, and they were videotaping something, they might take it away.
[02:12:26.644 --> 02:12:28.505]  Same thing in other third world countries.
[02:12:28.505 --> 02:12:35.007]  I know American tourists that we've interviewed that have been to North Korea and are allowed to videotape certain areas, but they've been caught in areas they're not supposed to be.
[02:12:35.007 --> 02:12:36.607]  They just take it away.
[02:12:36.607 --> 02:12:46.430]  In America, you videotape police in public, in fact, in some of these cases that this newscast covers, at city council meetings.
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:53.813]  And the cops beat somebody up and then turn, in one of these reports, to three people taping him and arrested all of them.
[02:12:55.262 --> 02:12:59.285]  And charge them with felony wiretapping.
[02:12:59.285 --> 02:13:13.354]  You're in a city council public building, cameras all around, it's on local television, local cable, in this particular case we've got here, and the cops arrest three people.
[02:13:13.354 --> 02:13:17.597]  These people, this is worse than North Korea, okay?
[02:13:18.615 --> 02:13:31.599]  Now, what's incredible is they go and actually throw the book at people, go to these kept moron juries, have the judge tell them, yes, the statute says this.
[02:13:31.599 --> 02:13:36.220]  Well, the statute goes on to say, but not in public if there's a perception, there's no perception of privacy.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:42.762]  They just ignore that and say, this is wiretapping, illegal wiretapping, and some people are being convicted.
[02:13:43.706 --> 02:13:49.628]  I found some cases, and I wrote part of this with Watson, and he says in here, you know, they've thrown out all the charges, well, in the cases he found.
[02:13:49.628 --> 02:13:54.969]  I've seen cases, we're going to have those added, where you do go to jail.
[02:13:54.969 --> 02:14:00.910]  If you're a poor person, don't know your rights, and you don't know how you get convicted to appeal it, it's over.
[02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:02.591]  You're going to jail.
[02:14:02.591 --> 02:14:07.032]  And see, the cops don't care if this is getting thrown out in these 12 states over and over again.
[02:14:07.904 --> 02:14:08.944]  In most cases.
[02:14:08.944 --> 02:14:11.845]  And then poor people that can't defend themselves are actually going to jail.
[02:14:11.845 --> 02:14:13.085]  They don't care.
[02:14:13.085 --> 02:14:20.528]  It is a brazen, cold-blooded attack on the First Amendment and free speech to chill it to the bone.
[02:14:20.528 --> 02:14:32.151]  I see cases now every few days, specifically with people being arrested when a cop comes up to their car, their wife starts videotaping it on an iPhone or Droid, and the cop says, what are you doing videotaping me?
[02:14:32.791 --> 02:14:38.097]  And they say, well, we're just taping this encounter.
[02:14:38.097 --> 02:14:41.300]  And one of the tapes, he said, that's it, you're anti-law enforcement.
[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:50.349]  See, in his crazy mind, why you don't like me because you're taping this, I'm going to go ahead and get you out, put you in handcuffs, and he takes the guy's wife to jail.
[02:14:50.349 --> 02:14:51.611]  You've seen these cases on the news.
[02:14:53.223 --> 02:14:55.665]  I mean, this is cuckoo crazy!
[02:14:55.665 --> 02:14:57.546]  But then it's not a rogue cop!
[02:14:57.546 --> 02:15:07.694]  He gets them down to the department, it goes to the prosecutor, you get released from jail, and then you end up going to trial!
[02:15:07.694 --> 02:15:10.436]  Member Lyon County, Kentucky.
[02:15:10.436 --> 02:15:12.738]  Kelly Rushing.
[02:15:12.738 --> 02:15:13.759]  Kelly Rushing.
[02:15:16.087 --> 02:15:19.649]  This is now seven years ago, six and a half years ago.
[02:15:19.649 --> 02:15:22.591]  I got calls from listeners going, hey, I've been arrested.
[02:15:22.591 --> 02:15:26.674]  I was handing out your videos to state police.
[02:15:26.674 --> 02:15:28.175]  Well, what was on the tape?
[02:15:28.175 --> 02:15:35.940]  Well, a Ron Paul speech called Neocon, and then your film Road to Tyranny, and they've charged me for both the Ron Paul speech and you.
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:37.321]  And I was like, send me some proof.
[02:15:38.311 --> 02:15:43.292]  Well, about a week later, comes in the mail, the Lyon County newspaper.
[02:15:43.292 --> 02:15:45.372]  I showed it on air, somewhere around here.
[02:15:45.372 --> 02:15:48.713]  And they were with a straight face, Kelly Rushing.
[02:15:48.713 --> 02:15:54.134]  And it turned out, great family, there for over a hundred years, well-known business owners.
[02:15:54.134 --> 02:15:59.215]  He was just like, hello officer, I'd like to give you this video about what's happening in America.
[02:15:59.215 --> 02:16:05.776]  The cop, a couple days later, comes and arrests him, and laughs at him, and calls his wife and says, I got the VHS bandit.
[02:16:05.776 --> 02:16:07.496]  VHS tape, still around then.
[02:16:09.491 --> 02:16:13.073]  And then I even, I still couldn't believe it, I called the judge.
[02:16:13.073 --> 02:16:14.173]  And I said, are you judge?
[02:16:14.173 --> 02:16:15.754]  He goes, yes, you're calling me at home.
[02:16:15.754 --> 02:16:16.215]  I says, alright.
[02:16:16.215 --> 02:16:17.055]  He goes, yeah.
[02:16:17.055 --> 02:16:20.077]  He was a southern gentleman, but obviously a tyrant.
[02:16:20.077 --> 02:16:23.738]  And I said, are you really about to have a trial for handing videos out?
[02:16:23.738 --> 02:16:26.480]  He goes, well, I can't talk about it, but yes, it's next week.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:34.944]  And they went in and put on a whole two-day trial, had a jury there, and they said no to both counts of threatening police.
[02:16:34.944 --> 02:16:37.886]  And the cop got on the thing and said, I find this video threatening.
[02:16:39.775 --> 02:16:45.018]  I mean this guy looked at Kelly Rushing like he wasn't even a human.
[02:16:45.018 --> 02:16:52.381]  A nice friendly guy pulling up to police and others going, hello officer, I want you to know about how we can save America.
[02:16:52.381 --> 02:16:56.763]  And these guys watch videos that freak them out.
[02:16:56.763 --> 02:16:59.545]  Freak them out because the truth hurts.
[02:16:59.545 --> 02:17:02.266]  And they go and arrest him and have a trial.
[02:17:02.266 --> 02:17:04.347]  Now, that's my issue here.
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:14.963]  Is that they're taking children and arresting parents for spanking them every day in this country when there's no law against spanking children.
[02:17:14.963 --> 02:17:15.804]  Check it out.
[02:17:15.804 --> 02:17:20.065]  They're taking children every day for not inoculating children when there's no law.
[02:17:20.065 --> 02:17:21.486]  You ask, how do they do that?
[02:17:21.486 --> 02:17:24.487]  They've got juries, ladies and gentlemen, that will do whatever they're told.
[02:17:25.717 --> 02:17:27.558]  In many areas.
[02:17:27.558 --> 02:17:35.861]  And they've got family courts set up as racial hygiene eugenics courts about 95 years ago, give or take, who would order sterilization.
[02:17:35.861 --> 02:17:36.902]  It's just a judge.
[02:17:36.902 --> 02:17:38.683]  They're not real courts.
[02:17:38.683 --> 02:17:39.863]  That's where we get family courts.
[02:17:39.863 --> 02:17:41.204]  They didn't exist before.
[02:17:41.204 --> 02:17:42.004]  You had a real jury.
[02:17:42.004 --> 02:17:43.385]  You had to have proof of something.
[02:17:43.385 --> 02:17:44.905]  That's how they're doing this.
[02:17:44.905 --> 02:17:47.226]  And it's a lawless criminal government.
[02:17:47.226 --> 02:17:50.388]  But I want to say something to police officers before I come back and play this clip and go to your calls.
[02:17:51.912 --> 02:17:55.973]  Listen, the Bill of Rights and Constitution is there to protect you just like us.
[02:17:55.973 --> 02:17:59.114]  And the fact is it was just a few months ago nine states doing this.
[02:17:59.114 --> 02:18:00.674]  Now it's 12 states doing it.
[02:18:00.674 --> 02:18:03.055]  And that's in the newscast coming up, like part of it.
[02:18:03.055 --> 02:18:04.956]  All things at Infowars.com.
[02:18:04.956 --> 02:18:10.017]  Local NBC affiliate there in the area where this happened.
[02:18:10.017 --> 02:18:12.198]  In Illinois.
[02:18:12.198 --> 02:18:16.699]  But imagine this guy is facing life in prison
[02:18:18.277 --> 02:18:24.862]  And the prosecutor is running around in the news saying, yes, we're going to put him in jail for life and feels good about that.
[02:18:24.862 --> 02:18:29.766]  Man, even if you're a soulless monster, I don't know if you are, but it sounds like it.
[02:18:29.766 --> 02:18:32.488]  Do you want that bad luck?
[02:18:32.488 --> 02:18:36.792]  I mean, you reap what you sow.
[02:18:36.792 --> 02:18:37.933]  I'm God-fearing, folks.
[02:18:37.933 --> 02:18:40.275]  You may not believe in God, but I've seen a lot in my life.
[02:18:40.275 --> 02:18:42.857]  Let me tell you, when you do bad, it comes back on you.
[02:18:43.632 --> 02:19:01.644]  I mean, I don't know how a prosecutor could sit there in some well-known businessman, 41-year-old, no criminal record, nice clean-cut guy, videotapes police, and they're trying to put him in jail for life.
[02:19:01.644 --> 02:19:04.926]  I mean, that's immoral on so many fronts.
[02:19:04.926 --> 02:19:09.970]  And then I read where the average sentence for a murderer is something like 14 years, and they serve seven.
[02:19:11.425 --> 02:19:14.206]  But you know they're going to keep him in there for decades.
[02:19:14.206 --> 02:19:19.648]  And this poor guy doesn't even know his rights and he's like, well I guess I'm going to be going to prison for life.
[02:19:19.648 --> 02:19:24.809]  I don't see how in America they do this, but I didn't know it was a law.
[02:19:24.809 --> 02:19:26.730]  Just the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:19:26.730 --> 02:19:29.451]  It isn't the law!
[02:19:29.451 --> 02:19:30.311]  Why do you think in
[02:19:32.613 --> 02:19:37.856]  38 states, the police know, yes it's your right to videotape, just don't interfere in police activity, stay back 20 feet.
[02:19:37.856 --> 02:19:39.637]  Cops can say that all day long.
[02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:44.960]  But you can't, you can't just, well, what's your wife doing taping me?
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:50.983]  You're going to jail lady, and then you get there, and the prosecutor's like, absolutely, let's send them to prison.
[02:19:50.983 --> 02:19:53.744]  Folks, this is the essence of tyranny.
[02:19:53.744 --> 02:19:57.266]  If police in 12 states will do this, God help us.
[02:19:57.266 --> 02:19:59.347]  Even when they know it's being thrown out in most cases.
[02:20:02.395 --> 02:20:07.079]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:20:07.079 --> 02:20:13.506]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:20:13.506 --> 02:20:15.788]  Number one, study the past.
[02:20:15.788 --> 02:20:18.190]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:21.913]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:20:23.024 --> 02:20:26.126]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:20:26.126 --> 02:20:29.968]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:20:29.968 --> 02:20:35.012]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:20:35.012 --> 02:20:38.434]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:20:39.014 --> 02:20:42.417]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.

[02:20:46.922 --> 02:20:51.847]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:20:51.847 --> 02:20:56.471]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.

[02:21:00.714 --> 02:21:02.135]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.135 --> 02:21:12.802]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:21:12.802 --> 02:21:20.007]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without your help.
[02:21:20.007 --> 02:21:30.654]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:21:31.254 --> 02:21:34.756]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:21:34.756 --> 02:21:40.898]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:21:40.898 --> 02:21:50.801]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:21:50.801 --> 02:21:52.302]  The war is here.
[02:21:52.302 --> 02:21:54.183]  It's an info war.
[02:21:54.183 --> 02:21:56.744]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:22:00.405 --> 02:22:02.448]  They're poisoning the water with fluoride.
[02:22:02.448 --> 02:22:04.611]  They're spraying the air with heavy metals.
[02:22:04.611 --> 02:22:07.254]  Why and what can you do to defend your family?
[02:22:07.254 --> 02:22:14.544]  This week at WaterWebinar.com, in an all new free live online webinar, Earth's most powerful cleansing secret is being revealed.
[02:22:14.544 --> 02:22:16.727]  A secret they don't want you to know about.
[02:22:16.727 --> 02:22:17.488]  Find out how today.
[02:22:17.588 --> 02:22:20.629]  Get fluoride and heavy metals out of your water and your body.
[02:22:20.629 --> 02:22:27.811]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, even mercury, and remove these accumulated poisons from your body.
[02:22:27.811 --> 02:22:35.094]  Go to WaterWebinar.com, a water secret so powerful some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[02:22:35.094 --> 02:22:38.575]  It was even used during Chernobyl to clean up nuclear contamination.
[02:22:38.575 --> 02:22:47.278]  Go to WaterWebinar.com now and sign up for free to find out how to turn the worst water on this planet into pristine, clear drinking water which heals your body.
[02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:53.300]  You can take your water freedom into your own hands and defend yourself and your family from the globalist health agenda.
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:54.601]  Don't get left behind.
[02:22:54.601 --> 02:22:57.042]  It's your life, your water, your freedom.
[02:22:57.042 --> 02:22:57.642]  Fight for it.
[02:22:57.642 --> 02:23:00.523]  Go to waterwebinar.com now.
[02:23:00.523 --> 02:23:06.946]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:23:06.946 --> 02:23:08.366]  I lost 20 pounds.
[02:23:08.366 --> 02:23:10.067]  I lost 40 pounds.
[02:23:10.067 --> 02:23:12.328]  I lost 55 pounds.
[02:23:12.328 --> 02:23:13.088]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[02:23:15.225 --> 02:23:22.111]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:23:22.111 --> 02:23:25.774]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:23:25.774 --> 02:23:29.858]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[02:23:29.858 --> 02:23:36.384]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:23:36.764 --> 02:23:44.947]  Plus, Ambarin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:23:51.869 --> 02:23:52.109]  That's 1-800-737-9107.
[02:23:52.109 --> 02:23:52.169]  1-800-737-9107.
[02:24:12.549 --> 02:24:14.891]  Well, you found it!
[02:24:14.891 --> 02:24:16.652]  The front lines of the Info War.
[02:24:16.652 --> 02:24:25.857]  The hardest-hitting, anti-New World Order, pro-liberty radio broadcast slash TV in the world.
[02:24:25.857 --> 02:24:29.759]  And of course, we're also the largest and fastest growing.
[02:24:29.759 --> 02:24:30.339]  That's why
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:35.464]  And it's quite a responsibility, but I'm stepping up to the plate.
[02:24:35.464 --> 02:24:38.866]  We're launching tomorrow night, five nights a week.
[02:24:38.866 --> 02:24:39.907]  It's a big commitment.
[02:24:39.907 --> 02:24:47.474]  30-minute hard-hitting with reporters, interviews, news packages, in-depth investigations.
[02:24:47.474 --> 02:24:48.855]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:24:48.855 --> 02:24:49.595]  And where do you find it?
[02:24:50.416 --> 02:25:04.083]  Find it at PrisonPlanet.TV and we're going to launch tomorrow some new URLs that take you to new pages and easier to find the information and on-demand and the live streams and a lot of new features.
[02:25:04.083 --> 02:25:11.587]  We may even put it up today but I want to I'm trying to add more content to these front pages of these new systems I've built.
[02:25:11.587 --> 02:25:18.371]  So if you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV subscriber become one today and support what we're doing and get the word out.
[02:25:18.371 --> 02:25:18.551]  Now
[02:25:20.123 --> 02:25:24.267]  And it's the supporters that have been members that have made a lot of this possible, so I want to commend and thank you.
[02:25:24.267 --> 02:25:25.728]  We're all doing this together.
[02:25:25.728 --> 02:25:34.316]  Now, getting back to the police, I'm going to come back in the next long segment and go to David, Thomas, Jay, Pat, Frank, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:25:34.316 --> 02:25:36.619]  I want to get this article out to everybody.
[02:25:37.583 --> 02:25:45.249]  And there's six guys in a little town by the name of Michael Allison, and we've tried them and a bunch of them are unlisted numbers.
[02:25:45.249 --> 02:25:54.676]  So we're trying to get this gentleman on the show so we can help him and advise him and say, sir, there's no perception of privacy in public.
[02:25:54.676 --> 02:25:57.998]  The police know that they falsely charged you.
[02:25:57.998 --> 02:25:59.919]  The prosecutor knows this.
[02:25:59.919 --> 02:26:02.982]  This is asinine, but the jury is going to be kept.
[02:26:02.982 --> 02:26:04.343]  If you get a public defendant,
[02:26:05.023 --> 02:26:08.146]  They work for the system, they're gonna put you in jail.
[02:26:08.146 --> 02:26:09.387]  This is a big deal.
[02:26:09.387 --> 02:26:12.150]  The system knows they're engaging in crime.
[02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:17.114]  They're so scared of cameras, they want to scare people not to videotape them.
[02:26:17.114 --> 02:26:20.157]  They want to use that against us, not the other way around.
[02:26:20.157 --> 02:26:22.459]  And so sir, not only should the charges be dropped,
[02:26:23.186 --> 02:26:26.689]  But you need to deal with a civil rights lawsuit.
[02:26:26.689 --> 02:26:31.332]  You need to call for criminal investigations, state police, whoever.
[02:26:31.332 --> 02:26:33.834]  That's like asking Satan to investigate in Illinois.
[02:26:33.834 --> 02:26:38.678]  But the point is, you've got to go after these people politically.
[02:26:38.678 --> 02:26:49.186]  They are willing to put you in jail for the rest of your life in a cell and make the taxpayers pay for it when they know filming in public is not illegal.
[02:26:49.186 --> 02:26:50.507]  Let's go to part of this newscast.
[02:26:50.507 --> 02:26:50.867]  Here it is.
[02:26:52.748 --> 02:26:54.489]  75 years behind bars.
[02:26:54.489 --> 02:27:00.751]  A prison sentence that long is rarely handed down, and it's usually just for murderers or rapists.
[02:27:00.751 --> 02:27:05.313]  But a local man faces 75 years in prison for a non-violent crime.
[02:27:05.313 --> 02:27:11.436]  What he's accused of doing is something many people have done, but most don't realize it's actually illegal.
[02:27:11.436 --> 02:27:12.396]  It's not!
[02:27:12.396 --> 02:27:13.737]  Let him go!
[02:27:13.737 --> 02:27:16.938]  What you're witnessing is now against the law in some states.
[02:27:19.313 --> 02:27:22.015]  This is also becoming illegal.
[02:27:22.015 --> 02:27:24.336]  As well as this.
[02:27:24.336 --> 02:27:28.859]  These infamous scenes are being banned in more and more states.
[02:27:28.859 --> 02:27:32.601]  The police in these recordings are not necessarily the ones breaking the law.
[02:27:32.601 --> 02:27:35.383]  It's the people recording the police.
[02:27:35.383 --> 02:27:42.607]  Recording audio of law enforcement without their consent is considered a crime in a dozen states including Illinois.
[02:27:42.607 --> 02:27:46.370]  That sounds like a plot in a movie to call what I did
[02:27:47.810 --> 02:27:50.051]  A crime is ridiculous.
[02:27:50.051 --> 02:27:54.334]  Michael Allison publicly recorded law enforcement in Robinson, Illinois.
[02:27:54.334 --> 02:27:59.916]  Now he's charged with five felonies with up to 15 years in prison for each count.
[02:27:59.916 --> 02:28:01.577]  That's a total of 75 years if convicted.
[02:28:03.779 --> 02:28:05.381]  75 years in prison.
[02:28:05.381 --> 02:28:08.225]  And it's just so unbelievable.
[02:28:08.225 --> 02:28:11.409]  Allison could spend the rest of his life behind bars.
[02:28:11.409 --> 02:28:15.053]  The 42-year-old is out on bail preparing to stand trial.
[02:28:15.053 --> 02:28:16.896]  The crime he's accused of?
[02:28:16.896 --> 02:28:17.957]  Eavesdropping.
[02:28:17.957 --> 02:28:19.139]  This doesn't make any sense.
[02:28:21.961 --> 02:28:27.284]  For one thing, the statute, as it's written, can be interpreted any which way.
[02:28:27.284 --> 02:28:28.364]  I can't hear anymore.
[02:28:45.462 --> 02:29:04.226]  On-duty law enforcement officials, all these little titles and the rest of it, they know full well, and I've read the Illinois statute because I've sent reporters up there by the way, they know full well that that is over a phone line or in a private building without their knowledge.
[02:29:04.226 --> 02:29:07.467]  And obviously if you're taping someone at a city council like he did,
[02:29:08.677 --> 02:29:16.000]  Or if you're taping cops on the street, or when they pull you over and they're videotaping you, it is asinine.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:21.882]  And they know full well that it is illegal what they're doing.
[02:29:21.882 --> 02:29:28.325]  To go lie to a jury, to put a statute against somebody that isn't written for what you're doing,
[02:29:29.221 --> 02:29:30.382]  It's totally illegal.
[02:29:30.382 --> 02:29:36.126]  Now, they also imply in the statute it's only legal to film cops in public.
[02:29:36.126 --> 02:29:38.928]  No, the way they're interpreting it, it's anybody.
[02:29:38.928 --> 02:29:46.473]  You can't videotape with audio going anybody, anywhere, including a football game, according to these guys.
[02:29:46.473 --> 02:29:50.296]  They want to put law-abiding citizens in prison to intimidate us.
[02:29:50.296 --> 02:29:51.697]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.697 --> 02:29:54.239]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.239 --> 02:29:56.901]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:03.852]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:03.852 --> 02:30:09.157]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:09.157 --> 02:30:10.699]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:10.699 --> 02:30:19.468]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:20.209 --> 02:30:27.757]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:27.757 --> 02:30:35.764]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:35.764 --> 02:30:40.989]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:30:40.989 --> 02:30:43.112]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800.
[02:30:44.654 --> 02:30:49.141]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:49.141 --> 02:30:53.649]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:31:00.797 --> 02:31:01.978]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.978 --> 02:31:08.902]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.902 --> 02:31:11.464]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.464 --> 02:31:16.847]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.847 --> 02:31:19.889]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.889 --> 02:31:21.950]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:28.454]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.454 --> 02:31:31.816]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.816 --> 02:31:37.600]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:39.261]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.261 --> 02:31:40.542]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.542 --> 02:31:43.224]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.224 --> 02:31:47.446]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.446 --> 02:31:50.028]  You can find the video at www dot
[02:31:50.228 --> 02:31:52.052]  End of America 3.com.
[02:31:52.052 --> 02:31:54.637]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:31:58.525 --> 02:31:59.607]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:01.357 --> 02:32:05.018]  Already, 2011 is a record-breaking year for disasters.
[02:32:05.018 --> 02:32:07.139]  Your family is your most precious asset.
[02:32:07.139 --> 02:32:10.980]  Could you feed them in case of emergency, food shortage, or job loss?
[02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:14.141]  At eFoods, we offer delicious, ready-made meals.
[02:32:14.141 --> 02:32:23.383]  Cheesy chicken and rice casserole, beef stroganoff, chili with dumplings, with the longest storable shelf life, and easily prepared in minutes by simply adding to boiling water.

[02:32:59.542 --> 02:33:15.935]  No one's gonna take me alive.
[02:33:15.935 --> 02:33:19.817]  The time has come to make things right.
[02:33:31.538 --> 02:33:33.099]  Okay, your calls are up next.
[02:33:33.099 --> 02:33:34.739]  Then the HPV vaccine.
[02:33:34.739 --> 02:33:39.982]  It's coming to every schoolgirl in Mexico, the deadly vaccine.
[02:33:39.982 --> 02:33:40.882]  That is coming up.
[02:33:40.882 --> 02:33:48.166]  But before we go to your calls, Diamond Gusset is offering $10 off every pair of work jeans for Alex Jones listeners.
[02:33:48.766 --> 02:33:50.067]  Through Labor Day.

[02:33:59.033 --> 02:34:02.316]  They're in Tennessee, same place Gibson Guitar is.
[02:34:02.316 --> 02:34:04.618]  You better buy American or forget your jobs, folks.
[02:34:04.618 --> 02:34:07.159]  I hope people figure this out.

[02:34:30.698 --> 02:34:34.900]  Incredible high-quality, produced right here in America, and made fresh every week.
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:36.620]  This isn't some 20-year-old crud.
[02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:39.622]  Folks, I'm not trying to bash other companies out there, but it's really true.
[02:34:39.622 --> 02:34:44.364]  There are some good ones, but a lot of them are selling crud, foreign-made, Chinese-made, or...
[02:34:45.822 --> 02:34:47.103]  It's just old.
[02:34:47.103 --> 02:34:50.384]  Well, not Interfood.
[02:34:50.384 --> 02:34:58.568]  This is brand new, super high-quality superfood, just like eFoods Direct and all our other storable foods companies.
[02:34:58.568 --> 02:35:04.151]  But Interfood's great because it's all these superfoods.
[02:35:04.151 --> 02:35:06.212]  You absorb a lot more of it than just with vitamins.
[02:35:06.792 --> 02:35:07.012]  I think?
[02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:27.261]  Spirulina, kelp, and other great things.
[02:35:27.261 --> 02:35:28.662]  It's also really good for your thyroid.

[02:35:44.617 --> 02:35:48.820]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to your phone calls.
[02:35:48.820 --> 02:35:50.982]  David in Florida, thank you for holding, sir.
[02:35:50.982 --> 02:35:58.127]  We've had Devon Notowson, Ron Paul, major presidential contender, and of course, Colonel Schaefer.
[02:35:58.127 --> 02:36:00.689]  Quite a transmission today.
[02:36:00.689 --> 02:36:01.369]  Yes, it is.
[02:36:01.369 --> 02:36:11.756]  Mr. Jones, I'm calling in because this morning I was listening to 106.5 FM out of Mobile, Alabama, and their guest talked about how, just like you said, Rick Perry campaigned for Al Gore.
[02:36:12.734 --> 02:36:20.213]  And also, something new about how it just came out that he was supporting Nancy Pelosi.
[02:36:21.223 --> 02:36:22.203]  Well, it's worse than that.
[02:36:22.203 --> 02:36:24.664]  Yes, of course, her as well.
[02:36:24.664 --> 02:36:27.705]  Back in her San Francisco days, I did see a report on that.
[02:36:27.705 --> 02:36:32.346]  But the big one that I just raised with Ron Paul was Hillary Care.
[02:36:32.346 --> 02:36:35.647]  He actually gave speeches, wrote letters, went public.
[02:36:35.647 --> 02:36:38.228]  He was Agriculture Commissioner at the time.
[02:36:38.228 --> 02:36:39.888]  The Daily Caller actually broke this.
[02:36:39.888 --> 02:36:40.749]  I didn't even know this.
[02:36:40.749 --> 02:36:48.691]  I mean, I knew he was a hardcore global warming supporter of Al Gore, presidential manager in Texas.
[02:36:49.691 --> 02:36:58.496]  Didn't become a Republican until 90, but then was, in some reports, you know, somewhat anti-gun, pro-open border.
[02:36:58.496 --> 02:37:00.918]  Here's an example of Rick Perry.
[02:37:00.918 --> 02:37:08.762]  He got an award five years ago, I have it on video, in Fall, not Fall of the Republic, that's another film, Battle for the Republic.
[02:37:08.762 --> 02:37:15.266]  That's a 16-minute mini-documentary extra on the hind end of Endgame.
[02:37:16.304 --> 02:37:23.174]  And of course the endgame ends with Rick Perry going to Bilderberg and us saying he's going to run for president and how he's a globalist and lookout.
[02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:26.751]  Again, that film's been out almost four years now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:28.593]  Talk about being evergreen.
[02:37:28.593 --> 02:37:33.357]  And, uh, Vicente Fox gave him an award for in-state tuition for illegals.
[02:37:33.357 --> 02:37:39.843]  Something somebody from Oklahoma, or Tennessee, or Mississippi, Louisiana, you know, a bordering state wouldn't even get.
[02:37:39.843 --> 02:37:42.585]  And going along with sanctuary cities.
[02:37:42.585 --> 02:37:48.670]  So then, this year in the legislature, to run for president, he then
[02:37:49.853 --> 02:37:58.562]  Had his people introduce ending sanctuary city laws and then killing himself behind the scenes just like TSA.
[02:37:58.562 --> 02:37:59.603]  Now that is
[02:38:00.965 --> 02:38:02.226]  Snake-like.
[02:38:02.226 --> 02:38:03.728]  And so, yes, here's the article.
[02:38:03.728 --> 02:38:08.633]  Rick Perry, Camp Defends 1993 Hillary Care Praise.
[02:38:08.633 --> 02:38:13.657]  And they've come out and said that, yes, we did support Hillary.
[02:38:13.657 --> 02:38:17.721]  And it's got links to his letters and the speeches and all of it.
[02:38:17.721 --> 02:38:19.563]  So a big Hillary Clinton supporter.
[02:38:19.563 --> 02:38:23.727]  Remember 93 with Rush Limbaugh saying, this is the greatest evil ever and everything?
[02:38:23.727 --> 02:38:24.088]  Meanwhile,
[02:38:24.628 --> 02:38:29.416]  Rick Perry was running around supporting it, but Rush Limbaugh endorses him.
[02:38:29.416 --> 02:38:31.500]  Oh, but you'll vote for Mitt Romney instead.
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:33.964]  Oh, Obamacare author.
[02:38:33.964 --> 02:38:35.586]  I mean, it doesn't get any worse than these two.
[02:38:36.832 --> 02:38:52.778]  Alex Jones also, what I'm really wanting to call about is, so I called in, and I said how that guest, his information was factual, and that how Rick Perry, it was a globalist agenda that he's supposed to be a fake Ron Paul, and it's the whole plan to push Paul aside.
[02:38:52.778 --> 02:39:00.722]  And so I said, you know, that we're hoping the callers would hear, or listeners would hear, that, you know, they need to learn who the, who pulled the strings.
[02:39:01.722 --> 02:39:07.806]  And that, um, because, you know, this agenda, you know, I said corporate fascists had threatened our U.S.
[02:39:07.806 --> 02:39:08.306]  sovereignty.
[02:39:08.306 --> 02:39:15.331]  Anyway, so, last thing I want to say is, a caller called in after me, and I hope you can get this to Ron Paul.
[02:39:15.331 --> 02:39:17.853]  He says he likes a few things, Ron Paul.
[02:39:18.493 --> 02:39:19.033]  No, no, no.
[02:39:19.033 --> 02:39:19.674]  They always say that.
[02:39:19.674 --> 02:39:23.575]  They always try to attack Paul by the awake American people.
[02:39:23.575 --> 02:39:24.676]  There is a global government.
[02:39:24.676 --> 02:39:25.556]  It's in the open now.
[02:39:41.263 --> 02:39:44.305]  Calling for global carbon taxes and VAT.
[02:39:44.305 --> 02:39:54.532]  And these mainline conservatives have been fed on a steady diet of fake conservatism and fake constitutionalism where they want Rick Perry.
[02:39:54.532 --> 02:39:55.372]  I mean, I've heard him.
[02:39:55.372 --> 02:39:56.653]  I don't care if he supports Hillary.
[02:39:56.653 --> 02:39:57.914]  I love Rick Perry.
[02:39:57.914 --> 02:39:59.215]  He's the new Ronald Reagan.
[02:39:59.215 --> 02:40:01.777]  They feel like they've bought into a winner.
[02:40:01.777 --> 02:40:05.139]  And so, oh, they're telling him he's going to win?
[02:40:05.139 --> 02:40:07.481]  Well, I'm going to support him.
[02:40:07.481 --> 02:40:10.763]  You know, I think if anything makes news, and I almost don't want it to,
[02:40:11.863 --> 02:40:17.186]  The Ron Paul interview was his statement about, well, Rick Perry might just walk away with it.
[02:40:17.186 --> 02:40:24.230]  You know, Ron Paul really can win, but Paul sees how they're just putting him out there.
[02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:39.878]  Listen, I've been to Republican events before, and when I was trying to support Pat Buchanan back in the mid-90s, I guess even in the early 90s, and I mean, some of these people, they're like weird sycophants who think Republican politicians are like rock stars.
[02:40:40.678 --> 02:40:44.300]  And they just grovel around and think it's cool to compromise?
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:46.522]  Well, they've compromised this country right into a rat hole.
[02:40:46.522 --> 02:40:48.963]  I appreciate your call, David.
[02:40:48.963 --> 02:40:50.644]  I mean, that's what they've done.
[02:40:50.644 --> 02:40:55.387]  And they like it that he supported Hillary.
[02:40:55.387 --> 02:41:00.571]  They like it that they support carbon taxes.
[02:41:00.571 --> 02:41:01.491]  Mitt Romney.
[02:41:01.491 --> 02:41:04.213]  They like it that he worked for Al Gore.
[02:41:04.213 --> 02:41:05.174]  They think that's cute.
[02:41:06.308 --> 02:41:08.109]  They like to get hurt.
[02:41:08.109 --> 02:41:09.369]  They like to fail.
[02:41:09.369 --> 02:41:12.031]  They like to sycophant around.
[02:41:12.031 --> 02:41:14.792]  And, uh, that's why Ron Paul's like almost laughing.
[02:41:14.792 --> 02:41:16.753]  It's like, well, that's who they want.
[02:41:16.753 --> 02:41:17.233]  Okay.
[02:41:17.233 --> 02:41:19.454]  I mean, he knows where this country's going.
[02:41:19.454 --> 02:41:20.774]  It's like, okay.
[02:41:20.774 --> 02:41:25.336]  Cause Ron Paul knows in the end, everything he's going to has talked about, he's already coming true.
[02:41:25.336 --> 02:41:27.017]  And the rest of it's going to come through.
[02:41:27.017 --> 02:41:28.938]  Then it's like, okay, you want to run off the side of a cliff.
[02:41:35.438 --> 02:41:39.141]  Thomas in California, welcome.
[02:41:39.141 --> 02:41:40.381]  Yes, Mr. Jones?
[02:41:40.381 --> 02:41:41.842]  Yes.
[02:41:41.842 --> 02:41:42.463]  How you doing?
[02:41:42.463 --> 02:41:43.844]  Good.
[02:41:43.844 --> 02:41:52.570]  I actually sent you an article from Alternet and another one from Reader Supported News.
[02:41:52.570 --> 02:42:01.395]  They both said one was exposing the Ron Paul progressives can't support, and the other one said treat Ron Paul with extreme caution.
[02:42:01.395 --> 02:42:03.217]  And the last sentence of the article said,
[02:42:04.617 --> 02:42:07.900]  Is there a progressive willing to join that fold?
[02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:10.943]  And then my response to that was, yes.
[02:42:10.943 --> 02:42:22.393]  Whether you like it or not, Ron Paul is the single candidate willing to confront those entities destroying our country like the Fed, the military industrial complex, and the disastrous trade issues, etc.
[02:42:23.556 --> 02:42:31.338]  And then every president who took on the banks before had been assassinated like Kennedy, Lincoln, Jackson, Garfield.
[02:42:31.338 --> 02:42:43.481]  And that we are under attack with a very dark element within our government and at least two or three elements outside of our government that have global domination in their sights.
[02:42:43.481 --> 02:42:50.302]  And that Obama has turned out to be our worst enemy and some kind of Trojan horse for the GOP.
[02:42:50.302 --> 02:42:52.203]  And that basically
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:43:07.384]  I just went on to cite my arguments about Ron Paul, but within the other responses, there's at least 80% of progressives and liberals that were supporting Ron Paul in the responses.
[02:43:07.384 --> 02:43:12.646]  Well, see, that's because there's probably 50 different types of, quote, progressives.
[02:43:12.646 --> 02:43:19.528]  There's the communist, globalist, corporatist, controlling, people go corporatist, communist, yeah, they created to control people.
[02:43:20.208 --> 02:43:23.632]  George Soros type that gives that term a bad name.
[02:43:23.632 --> 02:43:25.515]  You can call me a classical liberal.
[02:43:25.515 --> 02:43:27.477]  That's called an extreme right winger today.
[02:43:27.477 --> 02:43:28.659]  All these terms mean nothing.
[02:43:28.659 --> 02:43:34.446]  The point is, yes, in national polls, they've had scores of them, Ron Paul beats Obama.
[02:43:34.446 --> 02:43:36.088]  That's one of the questions I don't have time to get to.
[02:43:37.034 --> 02:43:39.355]  More than any other GOP candidate.
[02:43:39.355 --> 02:43:49.341]  And it's because a lot of people that don't even totally agree with all of his policies and ideas, because they're ignorant, they still like the fact that he does what he says he'll do and is a principled person.
[02:43:49.341 --> 02:43:54.063]  So yes, I've seen that on the, quote, liberal and progressive websites, that they like Ron Paul.
[02:43:54.063 --> 02:43:55.164]  He really will end the wars.
[02:43:55.164 --> 02:44:00.887]  He really will try to, you know, I mean, everybody realizes now this government doesn't work for us.
[02:44:00.887 --> 02:44:03.949]  And so even a lot of liberals are now out buying guns.
[02:44:03.949 --> 02:44:06.030]  They're, you know, they're starting to get more into reality.
[02:44:06.990 --> 02:44:12.876]  And, but again, when they thought they were about to win something, they supported Obama and didn't look at who backed him.
[02:44:12.876 --> 02:44:14.198]  It's the same thing with conservatives.
[02:44:14.198 --> 02:44:16.480]  Oh, we're about to beat Obama with Rick Perry.
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:18.342]  Not looking at what they're about to get.
[02:44:18.342 --> 02:44:20.124]  Guy bought and paid for by the same interest.
[02:44:20.124 --> 02:44:21.966]  I mean, it's so elementary.
[02:44:21.966 --> 02:44:25.129]  And those people, you know, it's like Tom Hartman.
[02:44:25.129 --> 02:44:28.232]  When I was attacking Bush, he would have me on his show and
[02:44:29.264 --> 02:44:32.885]  Come on this one, and understood I was outside the left-right paradigm.
[02:44:32.885 --> 02:44:38.667]  As soon as Obama gets in and starts attacking me, I go on his TV show, he makes fun of me and says extreme right winger.
[02:44:38.667 --> 02:44:41.488]  And I go, Tom, you know, these terms mean nothing.
[02:44:41.488 --> 02:44:43.149]  I want to rule a law and a constitution.
[02:44:44.042 --> 02:44:48.085]  And he just was hateful about it and tried to make stuff up.
[02:44:48.085 --> 02:44:55.449]  And it's like, man, these are political operatives for the Democrats and the Republicans.
[02:44:55.449 --> 02:45:03.994]  It sounds good to have big government to help people, but it'll never get delivered because the special interests will steal it.
[02:45:03.994 --> 02:45:05.435]  That's the nature of man.
[02:45:05.435 --> 02:45:07.396]  That's why it doesn't work.
[02:45:07.396 --> 02:45:09.818]  That's why we need a constitutional republic.
[02:45:09.818 --> 02:45:11.719]  I don't agree with anarchists who say no government.
[02:45:13.973 --> 02:45:17.456]  Look, most of these modern people cannot stand up to the Founders.
[02:45:17.456 --> 02:45:19.338]  That's why they attack the Founders.
[02:45:19.338 --> 02:45:21.199]  Because the system is scared of them.
[02:45:21.199 --> 02:45:32.790]  You were a rock star then, if you could use bigger words, have better arguments, better information, better philosophy, and could speak more languages, and could invent more things.
[02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:34.951]  Most of the Founding Fathers were inventors.
[02:45:34.951 --> 02:45:37.814]  You know, discovering how to channel electricity and stuff.
[02:45:37.814 --> 02:45:40.616]  I mean, back then it was about really being smart.
[02:45:41.377 --> 02:45:43.478]  That those were the rock stars then.
[02:45:43.478 --> 02:45:51.723]  So if we honored that today, we would be a different society and kids would want to be the rock star inventor.
[02:45:51.723 --> 02:45:56.025]  Now they know how to sell us somebody that dribbles a ball or hits a golf ball.
[02:45:57.606 --> 02:46:01.249]  As the heroes, and so our society's falling apart.
[02:46:01.249 --> 02:46:04.311]  The globalists know how to craft and control reality.
[02:46:04.311 --> 02:46:13.137]  But again, the fact that Ron Paul really is the frontrunner, they've got a few fake polls showing Rick Perry as number one, shows why the system's so scared.
[02:46:13.137 --> 02:46:18.160]  It's just amazing to even get Ron Paul on the show, and I appreciate your call.
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:18.861]  Anything else, Thomas?
[02:46:18.861 --> 02:46:21.403]  No, thank you very much.
[02:46:21.403 --> 02:46:22.663]  Thank you, I appreciate your call.
[02:46:25.390 --> 02:46:37.419]  Look, when you're talking to a mainline conservative idiot or a mainline liberal idiot, you gotta go, listen, the same big banks are financing both Obama and his main Republican challengers.
[02:46:37.419 --> 02:46:39.661]  The whole system's against Ron Paul.
[02:46:39.661 --> 02:46:40.562]  Come on.
[02:46:40.562 --> 02:46:43.584]  I mean, you're not that stupid.
[02:46:43.584 --> 02:46:48.228]  If you like the way things are going, keep voting for Rick Perry or Barack Obama.
[02:46:48.228 --> 02:46:49.369]  I mean, this is elementary.
[02:46:50.259 --> 02:46:51.320]  What is wrong with people?
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:57.643]  But they get... They've been taught since they were little kids in front of the TV in diapers that it's Coke, Pepsi, Ford, Chevy.
[02:46:57.643 --> 02:46:59.825]  And then they pick what the big winner is.
[02:46:59.825 --> 02:47:01.246]  You get to choose from one of these two.
[02:47:01.246 --> 02:47:04.728]  Oh, you don't want this one, a doctor with gray hair.
[02:47:04.728 --> 02:47:07.289]  Oh, look, it's Mitt Romney, Kendall.
[02:47:07.289 --> 02:47:08.890]  Oh, it's Obama.
[02:47:08.890 --> 02:47:12.792]  It's all a gimmick.
[02:47:12.792 --> 02:47:14.894]  The gimmicks are gonna kill us.
[02:47:14.894 --> 02:47:15.134]  Okay?
[02:47:15.134 --> 02:47:17.395]  It's gonna be reality that saves us.
[02:47:17.395 --> 02:47:18.616]  Jay and Mass, thanks for holding.
[02:47:20.902 --> 02:47:22.503]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:47:22.503 --> 02:47:23.964]  Thank you.
[02:47:23.964 --> 02:47:25.145]  Hey, I've been a long-term listener.
[02:47:25.145 --> 02:47:29.307]  I just finally got my presentplanet.tv subscription.
[02:47:29.307 --> 02:47:33.470]  I talk about you with my friends all the time and on air I have a Christian radio show.
[02:47:33.470 --> 02:47:38.513]  I had a question about the New World Order.
[02:47:38.513 --> 02:47:41.955]  I have conversations with friends and they say that there's no point in fighting the New World Order.
[02:47:42.837 --> 02:47:56.831]  Um, because, you know, as a Christian, read the New Testament, it says that there's gonna be, uh, it'll work, uh, it's gonna, it's prophesied in the New Testament, that there's gonna be a, a world more government, and, uh, you know, that satanic system, the Antichrist is gonna rise up.
[02:47:56.831 --> 02:47:59.253]  Might as well just let it happen, cause it's, you know, and I'm like, what?
[02:47:59.253 --> 02:48:01.095]  Like, I just wanted what your opinion was on that.
[02:48:01.095 --> 02:48:04.859]  Well, I've, that's something that I talk a lot about.
[02:48:06.500 --> 02:48:14.587]  Even if Armageddon is preparing to take place, it is our responsibility to aggressively fight evil and corruption.
[02:48:14.587 --> 02:48:17.429]  And God will say, you know, I don't know you.
[02:48:17.429 --> 02:48:21.953]  I mean, if you're a Christian and follow that system, then how can you go along with it?
[02:48:21.953 --> 02:48:28.858]  How can so many mainline Christians make fun of Ron Paul talking about global government when that's what the Bible teaches?
[02:48:28.858 --> 02:48:31.841]  See, it's a schizophrenic denial.
[02:48:32.816 --> 02:48:49.512]  Now, the truth is that if you really read the Bible, and it's clear, I don't want to get into arguments about it, it says that after Christ returns, the angel ties up the devil, throws him in the pit, Christ reigns for a thousand years.
[02:48:49.512 --> 02:48:52.976]  It's that when Christ returns, the dead rise and join him.
[02:48:52.976 --> 02:48:53.917]  That's there.
[02:48:53.917 --> 02:48:54.998]  There isn't a rapture
[02:48:56.932 --> 02:48:58.133]  Before all of this.
[02:48:58.133 --> 02:48:59.915]  So it's this ultimate cop-out.
[02:48:59.915 --> 02:49:02.617]  And Germans thought they were going to be raptured under Hitler.
[02:49:02.617 --> 02:49:04.198]  Christians under Pol Pot.
[02:49:04.198 --> 02:49:06.540]  Chinese always think they're going to be raptured.
[02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:09.022]  Did people get raptured?
[02:49:09.022 --> 02:49:12.685]  The disciples getting crucified and hung upside down and boiled in oil?
[02:49:12.685 --> 02:49:13.706]  No, no.
[02:49:13.706 --> 02:49:17.910]  See, this is a giant cop-out and was sold.
[02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:19.491]  But for the secular folks, they sell 2012.
[02:49:20.652 --> 02:49:35.246]  They say, oh, in 2000, Planet X is coming, and then 2003, and then 2006, and I get emails, I know that July 15th of this year, you're going to be in a bunker in your government, you know that Planet Zoopal or something's coming, and then it's...
[02:49:37.288 --> 02:49:38.529]  I don't know.
[02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:08.506]  If the psychological warfare chiefs learned that if you teach people it's the end of the world, they're going to lay down and take it.
[02:50:08.506 --> 02:50:14.292]  Why did the Aztecs, even though they outnumbered the Spanish conservatively, 500 to 1, there in Mexico City?
[02:50:17.725 --> 02:50:19.746]  Where their big temple complex was.
[02:50:19.746 --> 02:50:35.797]  I mean a couple hundred Spaniards show up with a couple cannons and they had a prophecy about the end of the world and a metal man coming and so the guys in metal armor showed up and they just went crazy and started running off cliffs and gave up and said you're God and fell down.
[02:50:36.519 --> 02:50:37.559]  In front of them.
[02:50:37.559 --> 02:50:45.661]  For a while, then figured out they weren't God and, you know, by then the disease had spread, the smallpox, and wiped most of them out.
[02:50:45.661 --> 02:50:48.121]  But again, that's all it is.
[02:50:48.121 --> 02:50:50.022]  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:50:50.022 --> 02:50:51.882]  They got it for secular people.
[02:50:51.882 --> 02:50:53.302]  They got it for Christians.
[02:50:53.302 --> 02:50:54.743]  If you're just like, why would you not care?
[02:50:54.743 --> 02:50:56.343]  It's the end of the world anyways.
[02:50:56.343 --> 02:50:58.443]  Then you sit out of the game of life.
[02:50:58.443 --> 02:50:59.544]  It's a cop-out.
[02:50:59.544 --> 02:51:00.144]  It's a joke.
[02:51:00.144 --> 02:51:00.564]  It's a game.

[02:54:24.957 --> 02:54:27.439]  Alright, let's jam in some more phone calls here.
[02:54:27.439 --> 02:54:30.842]  Pat in New Jersey, thanks for holding, welcome.
[02:54:30.842 --> 02:54:52.800]  Hi Alex, first off I want to state that I am a Ron Paul supporter, but I've noticed that you've acknowledged in past broadcasts that an armed populace could successfully resist a foreign or domestic standing army using asymmetric warfare and guerrilla tactics, and obviously keep criminals from thriving, so I'm just wondering why you
[02:54:54.335 --> 02:55:01.863]  Don't support a private property anarchism that Mary Rothbard and other philosophers advocate for?
[02:55:01.863 --> 02:55:13.836]  Well, number one, in the type of position that we're in now, and the way society's operating, to even sit there and discuss pure anarchy
[02:55:16.043 --> 02:55:18.124]  You know, isn't even in the real world.
[02:55:18.124 --> 02:55:19.664]  I mean, what would China do?
[02:55:19.664 --> 02:55:21.245]  What would Russia do?
[02:55:21.245 --> 02:55:28.427]  The problem is, it has to be a philosophy that spreads worldwide, then in increments you move towards more and more liberty.
[02:55:28.427 --> 02:55:34.808]  There's always going to be gangs that bound together, and then the anarchists say, well, we'll have a corporation or a group that then deals with them.
[02:55:34.808 --> 02:55:38.129]  Well, exactly, and you're back to square one.
[02:55:38.129 --> 02:55:43.851]  You've got to have local control, and you can have anarchy in a rural area,
[02:55:44.915 --> 02:55:51.198]  If people are generally culturally similar and have the same code of ethics and are heavily armed.
[02:55:51.198 --> 02:55:54.600]  Because people will then spontaneously get together to defend others.
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:56.741]  It does work in rural areas.
[02:55:56.741 --> 02:55:59.963]  It does not work in the society and the system we've got today.
[02:55:59.963 --> 02:56:06.586]  Speaking of violence, 90% of war is information and moral high ground.
[02:56:06.586 --> 02:56:12.349]  If the minute there was some armed uprising, the globalists would go out and commit a bunch of massacres.
[02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:13.170]  It's on the books.
[02:56:13.170 --> 02:56:13.750]  That's their plan.
[02:56:15.114 --> 02:56:16.436]  To then blame it on us.
[02:56:16.436 --> 02:56:21.803]  It'd be a bunch of school kids strung up with their guts hanging out on the news, and they would say that we did it.
[02:56:21.803 --> 02:56:24.748]  They'd probably show a morphed video of me doing it.
[02:56:24.748 --> 02:56:25.228]  Okay?
[02:56:25.228 --> 02:56:28.833]  So, the point is there's some very childlike
[02:56:29.841 --> 02:56:30.061]  I don't
[02:56:45.922 --> 02:56:59.825]  With the overrunning of the emplacement, swinging my musket, and there's guys up on the parapet going, and we will have perfect systems of, you know, philosophying, and I'm like, argh, swinging my musket around, and they're going, and then it will be perfect, pure anarchy.
[02:56:59.825 --> 02:57:01.705]  Well, let me debate that with you, my good friend.
[02:57:01.705 --> 02:57:14.148]  Oh, that Alex does not understand the subtleties of the anarchical capitalist instructions of the stricture, and I'm like, just full-on, you know, absolute war with the globalists.
[02:57:14.148 --> 02:57:15.408]  You gotta deal with the globalists.
[02:57:16.833 --> 02:57:24.779]  And so it's... I just see a lot of arguments by the pure anarchy people that don't live in reality.
[02:57:24.779 --> 02:57:32.724]  So someday if we got rid of most government and got back to the constitutional system and we educated everybody and that worked, maybe we can start testing it.
[02:57:32.724 --> 02:57:35.346]  Well, these states vote to be in total anarchy, dissolve everything.
[02:57:35.346 --> 02:57:37.547]  Let's see what happens there.
[02:57:37.547 --> 02:57:39.669]  Now do you see what I'm saying there, buddy?
[02:57:40.566 --> 02:57:52.598]  Yeah, look, you have many countries now, I mean, there's, you know, take Switzerland, or there's actually an area of Mexico right now that has completely overthrown the Mexican government, an entire state that has been without government for years now.
[02:57:52.598 --> 02:58:01.788]  Yeah, and those states are absolute, absolute abject hellholes of lawlessness and poverty and starvation.
[02:58:01.788 --> 02:58:03.750]  And I'm not saying the government brought that.
[02:58:05.602 --> 02:58:07.223]  Or that government would bring something good.
[02:58:07.223 --> 02:58:13.105]  They had bad, corrupt government, and now it's out of the equation and it's degenerated even more.
[02:58:13.105 --> 02:58:16.846]  You've got to go towards higher orders of liberty.
[02:58:16.846 --> 02:58:21.728]  You don't go from abject, dumbed-down masses into a structure of liberty.
[02:58:21.728 --> 02:58:23.588]  It's a process, as Ron Paul has said.
[02:58:23.588 --> 02:58:27.590]  I mean, comprende on that, Pat?
[02:58:28.843 --> 02:58:33.488]  Well, yeah, I mean, but then you have countries like Switzerland who don't get attacked by their neighbors.
[02:58:33.488 --> 02:58:35.631]  Well, no, that's a sovereign nation.
[02:58:35.631 --> 02:58:37.393]  They've got all sorts of rules there.
[02:58:37.393 --> 02:58:38.554]  That's not anarchy.
[02:58:38.554 --> 02:58:38.955]  Stay there.
[02:58:38.955 --> 02:58:42.719]  We're doing an overdrive.
[02:58:42.719 --> 02:58:46.163]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.163 --> 02:58:48.386]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.532 --> 02:58:56.553]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.553 --> 02:58:59.794]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.794 --> 02:59:04.595]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.595 --> 02:59:10.976]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.976 --> 02:59:13.217]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.757 --> 02:59:14.057]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.057 --> 02:59:14.337]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.337 --> 02:59:14.878]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.878 --> 02:59:15.678]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:15.678 --> 02:59:18.019]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.665 --> 02:59:34.786]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.786 --> 02:59:39.928]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:59:55.674 --> 02:59:58.875]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.318 --> 03:00:17.340]  Look, Pat, I want to go to at least Frank, because he's been holding a real long time.
[03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:19.300]  And I'm probably not going to get to the other callers.
[03:00:19.300 --> 03:00:20.101]  I got to most of you, though.
[03:00:20.101 --> 03:00:25.302]  I apologize, as is normal at the end of the transmission, while we extend it for you.
[03:00:25.302 --> 03:00:30.164]  But I can have a debate about anarchy and really state my position on it.
[03:00:30.164 --> 03:00:32.024]  It's uncharted territory.
[03:00:32.024 --> 03:00:36.426]  The examples of anarchy I've seen have been road warrior-esque.
[03:00:38.045 --> 03:00:41.447]  I mean, really, we did have a form of anarchy in this country.
[03:00:41.447 --> 03:00:45.830]  It's called the Wall-Wall West.
[03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:50.253]  But you talk about Switzerland and talking about anarchy, you're talking about a sovereign country.
[03:00:50.253 --> 03:00:52.174]  They actually have a lot of rules there.
[03:00:52.174 --> 03:00:58.878]  But the people have agreed to institute those for their mutual prosperity.
[03:00:58.878 --> 03:01:01.319]  That's a lot different than what you're talking about.
[03:01:01.319 --> 03:01:05.342]  As the founders said, only a moral people can have liberty.
[03:01:06.471 --> 03:01:09.154]  And that's been proven.
[03:01:09.154 --> 03:01:16.522]  Let me tell you something, as bad as the police are, as out of control as they get, there's times that you want them.
[03:01:16.522 --> 03:01:21.567]  And then there's the problem of they don't want you to be able to arm yourself, so they're the monopoly of power.
[03:01:23.069 --> 03:01:24.049]  I believe in the sheriff.
[03:01:24.049 --> 03:01:29.491]  I mean, why don't cities make deals with sheriff's departments where they're elected and accountable?
[03:01:29.491 --> 03:01:38.533]  And nothing's perfect, but getting off into a debate here with you, Pat, you're raising Switzerland as an example of anarchy?
[03:01:38.533 --> 03:01:47.796]  No, but the reason that neighbors don't attack Switzerland is not because they have a government, it's because the entire populace is armed and Hitler would never invade there because he knew he couldn't defeat them.
[03:01:47.796 --> 03:01:50.157]  It's also a good place to stash his cash.
[03:01:50.157 --> 03:01:50.877]  Yeah, but
[03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:54.441]  I agree with you.
[03:01:54.441 --> 03:01:58.143]  And it's actually the Swiss model that's the Dutch model that's our model.
[03:01:58.143 --> 03:02:01.325]  And so I would like to move towards liberty.
[03:02:01.325 --> 03:02:02.546]  It's just that it's a process.
[03:02:02.546 --> 03:02:03.807]  So I don't think we disagree, Pat.
[03:02:03.807 --> 03:02:04.808]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:04.808 --> 03:02:06.209]  Frank in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:02:06.209 --> 03:02:06.489]  Welcome.
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:11.583]  Hey Alex, just a quick, a few quick things.
[03:02:11.583 --> 03:02:18.608]  You know, talking about anarchy, if there was a scientific, compassionate application of anarchy, I'd be all for that.
[03:02:18.608 --> 03:02:27.215]  But then you would just see the same, I think, the same kinds of corrupt behaviors that you see on larger levels within the government and everything like that.
[03:02:27.215 --> 03:02:33.961]  I am a Ron Paul supporter, and the thing about Ron Paul is that I don't think he could ever really
[03:02:34.793 --> 03:02:36.435]  I don't think he can get the nomination.
[03:02:36.435 --> 03:02:39.359]  You know, that's the frustrating thing for me.
[03:02:39.359 --> 03:02:40.680]  But get this.
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:44.625]  If he doesn't win, don't be crestfallen.
[03:02:44.625 --> 03:02:45.987]  Don't be depressed.
[03:02:45.987 --> 03:02:50.332]  He's winning by injecting real issues and growing the Liberty Movement.
[03:02:50.332 --> 03:02:52.575]  It is resistance that's victory.
[03:02:52.575 --> 03:02:54.137]  It's like lifting weights or jogging.
[03:02:55.530 --> 03:03:01.995]  I mean, you've got to put yourself through stress and take the field to grow and to master anything.
[03:03:01.995 --> 03:03:06.038]  And that's why Ron Paul, I told him privately and on air, I said, we're drafting you.
[03:03:06.038 --> 03:03:11.422]  By the way, we've got a couple new Ron Paul t-shirts out where you support us a little bit, mainly get the word out about Ron Paul.
[03:03:11.422 --> 03:03:14.664]  Let me show folks that.
[03:03:14.664 --> 03:03:20.609]  And as you support the info war and get the word out about Ron Paul, and that's Save the Republic Ron Paul.
[03:03:21.584 --> 03:03:24.126]  I just hope that Jesse Ventura is on the other side of that ticket.
[03:03:49.522 --> 03:03:52.484]  It'd be Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, 2012, that'd be pretty sick.
[03:03:52.484 --> 03:04:13.137]  You know, Ron, Jesse Ventura is a great guy and a man of principles, and I really respect him and I'm friends with him, but I don't think Ron Paul would have Jesse Ventura on his ticket, probably, if you really, I mean, if you get down to brass tacks, because he disagrees with a few of Ron Paul's positions.
[03:04:13.137 --> 03:04:15.238]  And Ron Paul is 100% no compromise.
[03:04:17.723 --> 03:04:19.284]  One hundred percent.
[03:04:19.284 --> 03:04:22.007]  It's like folks that say put Dennis Kucinich.
[03:04:22.007 --> 03:04:24.228]  Dennis Kucinich is somewhat principled.
[03:04:24.228 --> 03:04:28.892]  He bowed to the socialist government takeover of healthcare as he got it right on Air Force One.
[03:04:28.892 --> 03:04:30.253]  Lost a lot of respect.
[03:04:30.253 --> 03:04:39.280]  I disagree with Kucinich on a lot of issues, but the fact that he's normally principled makes me respect him in a field of other miscreants.
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:42.623]  But Ron Paul would never have Dennis Kucinich as running mate.
[03:04:42.623 --> 03:04:44.504]  That's the opposite of what he believes in.
[03:04:45.487 --> 03:04:46.528]  All right, folks.
[03:04:46.528 --> 03:04:48.569]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:04:48.569 --> 03:04:49.330]  Central.
[03:04:49.330 --> 03:04:57.095]  Don't forget, we're about 26, 27 hours out from the launch of M4 Wars Nightly News tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[03:04:57.095 --> 03:04:57.516]  Central.
[03:04:57.516 --> 03:04:58.276]  Please spread the word.
[03:04:58.276 --> 03:04:58.676]  This is Buena.TV.
