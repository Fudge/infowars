[00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:06.532]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:08.293]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:10.054]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:11.634]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:13.175]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:17.377]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:25.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.142]  It is the first day
[00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:35.049]  of March 2011 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.570]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.950]  The news is intensifying.
[00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.392]  The frequency of just earth-shaking events are accelerating.
[00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:49.873]  We're going to have a jam-packed transmission for you today.
[00:00:50.593 --> 00:01:03.757]  Joining us from Beirut, the one, the only, international TV host Max Keiser will be joining us from the Middle East with breaking news coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:10.680]  He's got breaking news and developments dealing with Blackwater training in Israel and planning a strike in Lebanon.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:25.571]  It's also been confirmed that they're training with South African mercenary companies all over Africa for intensified strikes there as well, not just in and around Palestine.
[00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:33.958]  We also then have joining us part three of the live interview with Pastor Lindsey Williams with his inside oil company connections.
[00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:34.839]  Remember in October,
[00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.141]  When oil was $65, $70 a barrel, he said it would soon go to $150.
[00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.123]  Within six months to a year, that's now moving up in that direction.
[00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:49.406]  He was told that by a former CEO of one of the big three oil companies known to myself.
[00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:50.286]  We can't give you the source.
[00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:57.193]  Of course, Ken Fromm was the former head of operations for Atlantic Richfield, died last December, so we can now reveal that source.
[00:01:57.193 --> 00:02:12.448]  Continuing, we have Webster Tarpley popping in in the last 30 minutes to talk about what's happening in North Africa and the Middle East and the domino effect, generally triggered by commodity prices increasing due to ongoing dollar devaluation and speculation.
[00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:14.149]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.351]  Bernie Madoff did a big interview with New York Magazine.
[00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:24.712]  I continue to be impressed by the interviews that New York Magazine gets.
[00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:33.774]  And they did a tape jailhouse interview with Bernie Madoff, where Madoff basically told the truth.
[00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:36.134]  Whole government is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:02:36.134 --> 00:02:38.775]  He went on to say Goldman Sachs is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:41.055]  And the media kind of spun it like, well, this guy's a crook.
[00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.856]  Well, yeah, the founder of the Nasdaq.
[00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:53.619]  I mean, the modern derivatives investment banking system since the end of Glass-Steagall in 99 is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.861]  I mean, how many top economists do I have to have on to explain that?
[00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:06.465]  But the issue here is, all of these entitlements, all of these interest payments,
[00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:15.787]  to these private banks are based on always increasing the amount of debt because it is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:03:15.787 --> 00:03:28.469]  And we're now entering those final phase of the situation where it basically becomes amplified and where the hyperinflation begins to rear its ugly head.
[00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:35.171]  Just last week they had another big treasury auction and record numbers
[00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:36.552]  I think?
[00:04:00.952 --> 00:04:23.946]  With this historically that that that governments tend to start wars to get out of depressions and governments almost always Try to have police state crackdowns as their answer to these type of economic Developments this type of economic climate so we're gonna be going over all of that as well today when we come back after the break also
[00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:33.178]  I have predicted it here, ad nauseum, because I understand the mindset, the modus operandi of the globalist.
[00:04:33.178 --> 00:04:36.962]  And I have the executive order signed by Bill Clinton.
[00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:40.605]  And they normally put stuff on the books decades before they implement it.
[00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:47.972]  The TSA is rolling out on the streets of America, now searching even small children on street corners and getting off trains.
[00:04:47.972 --> 00:04:50.093]  Now they want to take your DNA to get on the airplane.
[00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.707]  And it's all a psychological warfare test.
[00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:56.315]  This is our prisoner enslavement training.
[00:04:56.315 --> 00:04:58.120]  We're going to come back and cover that.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.541]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.639]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.901]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:09.444]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.444 --> 00:05:12.086]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:17.951]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:24.197]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.597 --> 00:05:30.580]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.761]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:39.043]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:44.985]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:48.547]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:50.528]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:50.968]  It's here.

[00:06:52.885 --> 00:06:53.566]  Thank you!
[00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:04.469]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:05.390]  Number 1.
[00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.813]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:09.673]  Number 2.
[00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:14.557]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:15.317]  It's true.
[00:07:15.317 --> 00:07:20.181]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:21.002]  Number 3.
[00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:24.584]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:24.584 --> 00:07:28.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:28.487 --> 00:07:29.288]  Number 4.
[00:07:29.288 --> 00:07:32.050]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.734]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:35.734 --> 00:07:36.515]  Number 5.
[00:07:36.515 --> 00:07:40.678]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:45.443]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:45.703 --> 00:07:49.886]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.667]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:53.928]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:53.928 --> 00:07:56.750]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.735]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:06.537]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:12.557]  Feels like a Monday, but it's a Tuesday.
[00:08:12.557 --> 00:08:27.770]  I just got back from the early morning hours from New York City, where I was on CNN, The View, and some other national TV outlets talking about the whole Charlie Sheen situation.
[00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.952]  Before this hour ends, I really had time to cogitate.
[00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:36.714]  Uh, and, uh, think a lot about this whole scandal.
[00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:45.177]  And so I'll have some brief, uh, but, but focused, uh, comments on that coming up towards the end of this hour.
[00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:48.037]  Then Max Keiser joins us from Beirut.
[00:08:48.037 --> 00:08:51.718]  Uh, Lindsey Williams for part three of the live interview we started a few weeks ago.
[00:08:51.718 --> 00:08:56.980]  Uh, and of course, uh, Webster Tarpley in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:04.401]  Here are just some of the headlines that we have here today that I'm going to be going over in detail.
[00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:11.647]  This is out of a WMUR television bill would make some airport screening sexual assault.
[00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:19.413]  Well, I've had district attorneys on, the district attorney from the county where San Francisco's based, where the airport's based, saying that they have their officers
[00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:21.375]  in the airport
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.660]  I think?
[00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:01.177]  I don't know.
[00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:17.058]  Zero.
[00:10:17.058 --> 00:10:18.178]  Zero.
[00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:23.860]  And my crew reports to me that all over the country, the scanners are completely turned off.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.522]  Listeners report that they're either completely turned off or not in heavy use.
[00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:35.444]  And I've also talked to a lot of pilots who've told me that they are turned off all over the country, including LAX.
[00:10:35.444 --> 00:10:37.185]  So what does that say about the system?
[00:10:38.226 --> 00:11:00.788]  Well, I guess that Michael Chertoff and others have made collectively their billions of dollars off of the systems, and they know that the people have revolted against them, and they hate it because if we have victory against this, we will learn that collectively we can have victory against every other un-American police state development.
[00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:05.891]  And so the Globalists are basically just lying low right now and playing possum.
[00:11:05.891 --> 00:11:21.363]  Though when I flew out of Austin and flew back in, when I got in about 1 o'clock in the morning last night, when the airport wasn't having any more flights out, they were like busy bees at the three checkpoints putting in the naked body scanners.
[00:11:21.903 --> 00:11:29.868]  And I walked up to the TSA agents that were still there guarding the workmen from the evil Americans.
[00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:33.150]  And I said, so you're putting in the microwave machines.
[00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.593]  And they leered at me like, how dare you, a lowly serf.
[00:11:37.253 --> 00:11:37.973]  What do you think this is?
[00:11:37.973 --> 00:11:47.979]  The United States of America talked to us, and I said, well, know this, you think you're gonna hurt us with your little microwave machines that have been documented to be linked to cancer and DNA damage?
[00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:51.341]  Who it really hurts are those of you that work around them all day.
[00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:55.463]  So I said, 100% cancer.
[00:11:55.463 --> 00:12:00.026]  And looked them all in the eyes, and they looked at each other, and then looked down at their feet.
[00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:05.309]  So, 30 seconds into the conversation, they weren't arrogantly getting off on their little uniforms.
[00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:13.641]  Now, that said, when I flew out, the TSA, two of the officers wanted to shake my hand and said, we appreciate what you're doing.
[00:12:13.641 --> 00:12:18.848]  I don't want to get them in too much trouble, but they told me some other things.
[00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:19.970]  One of them whispered in my ear.
[00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.272]  So certainly...
[00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:24.352]  Certainly they're awakening.
[00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:38.756]  I also had one of the airport officials, who I've known for years, come to my office last week and tell me off-record some just amazing horror stories of some of the TSA leadership at the Austrian-Bergstrom International Airport.
[00:12:38.756 --> 00:12:48.879]  But then, of course, I can't reveal those stories, because then it would finger exactly who told me those stories, because some of this happened behind closed doors.
[00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:49.860]  But can you imagine
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.545]  The type of sexual harassment that goes on.
[00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:59.294]  If you've got TSA people harassing women who are going through checkpoints, imagine what they do to other airport workers.
[00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:07.933]  And we've seen cases of this where the TSA will make fun of someone's genital size repeatedly until they finally punch them in the nose.
[00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:10.395]  And that's another TSA agent.
[00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:12.516]  We see the pilots becoming outraged.
[00:13:12.516 --> 00:13:21.920]  But the good news here is the people are beginning to wake up to what's happening and getting angry and realizing that this is sexual assault.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.661]  We don't really need any new laws.
[00:13:24.661 --> 00:13:26.042]  Government is not above the law.
[00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:31.071]  Here's another great illustration of this.
[00:13:31.071 --> 00:13:39.297]  If you've got a dental office or you've got a clinic or you've got an emergency room, every month by federal law
[00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:47.665]  Not just regulations under OSHA, they have to do full calibration readings to make sure that they're not malfunctioning.
[00:13:47.665 --> 00:13:52.469]  Because even a low-powered x-ray can become many times more powerful than a chest x-ray.
[00:13:52.469 --> 00:14:05.760]  And a chest x-ray or a MRI, you saw the New York Times last year admitting that MRIs all over the country are basically causing cancer, killing people, hitting them so hard with radiation that their hair is all falling out.
[00:14:06.684 --> 00:14:16.433]  Well, it's the same situation with these naked body scanners that, depending on which system, have 20-plus to 50-plus times the radiation.
[00:14:16.433 --> 00:14:22.579]  Source on that, Los Angeles Times and other major publications in the last two years that have reported on that.
[00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:28.745]  And Congress, about nine months ago, requested, ordered, and that's the government, the elected government,
[00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:30.098]  That's
[00:14:46.067 --> 00:14:47.188]  Homeland Security said.
[00:14:47.188 --> 00:14:49.570]  They said, no way, Jack.
[00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.172]  So, Bush can order torture.
[00:14:52.172 --> 00:14:54.394]  It's completely illegal, but he writes memos.
[00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.396]  And then when their own minions get caught doing it, the minions go to prison.
[00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:01.159]  And then Bush writes a book and gives speeches saying he'd order torture again.
[00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:03.010]  above the law.
[00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:03.991]  They think they are.
[00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:05.412]  The Fuhrer precept.
[00:15:05.412 --> 00:15:06.774]  Same thing with the TSA.
[00:15:06.774 --> 00:15:10.457]  Hey, we don't have to wear any stinking radiation badges.
[00:15:10.457 --> 00:15:13.460]  We don't have to calibrate these.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.222]  We don't have to have them serviced.
[00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:22.749]  We don't have to have radiologist technicians come in and run the machines and do tests and get readings.
[00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:24.131]  We can do whatever we want.
[00:15:27.045 --> 00:15:31.688]  This shows how the precedent's being set for them to just engage in any activity they wish.
[00:15:31.688 --> 00:15:40.594]  Now, suddenly, we're seeing the plans that Homeland Security announced eight years ago coming to fruition at bus terminals in Florida.
[00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:47.596]  At train stations in Boston and New York and California, the reports are coming out almost every day.
[00:15:47.596 --> 00:15:51.439]  I'm seeing them every few days, and I'm not even looking for them, so I'm sure there's more out there.
[00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:55.621]  But you can just search, boy padded down getting off train.
[00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.903]  Woman padded down getting off bus.
[00:15:58.903 --> 00:16:03.926]  TSA Viper teams run checkpoints on highway in Houston.
[00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:10.457]  Or you can pull up Fox News from about a year ago in upstate New York.
[00:16:10.457 --> 00:16:15.839]  National Guard helps arrest 2,000 people for drugs and guns.
[00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:23.562]  And there's a newscast with super high-power x-rays having families drive their cars under them.
[00:16:23.562 --> 00:16:32.106]  And the National Guard, under Homeland Security directives, being trained by TSA, is standing there right beside the scanners.
[00:16:34.158 --> 00:16:39.343]  I mean, do you have any idea how dead these people are?
[00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:41.365]  But see, it's funny to them.
[00:16:41.365 --> 00:16:42.566]  They think they're bulletproof.
[00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:56.579]  It's like a young person that starts smoking cigarettes, and you feel like you're invincible, you feel like you're always gonna be young, and five minutes figuratively goes by, it seems like five minutes, and you're 67 years old, and hey buddy, you got lung cancer.
[00:16:56.579 --> 00:16:57.920]  We're gonna chop one of your lungs out.
[00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:08.212]  Or it's like an alcoholic that doesn't believe that drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels every day is going to pickle their liver, and they don't listen to their doctor, and they go into liver failure.
[00:17:08.212 --> 00:17:08.893]  Or kidney failure.
[00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:21.672]  I mean, you sit there and you talk to these TSA people, and I do it all over the country, and a lot of them either shake your hand and go, we know, we know, we're trying to unionize, or they laugh at you and get angry.
[00:17:21.672 --> 00:17:22.833]  And here's the issue.
[00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:31.056]  We've confirmed that TSA agents are called in and asked, do you have a problem patting people down, putting your hands down their pants?
[00:17:31.056 --> 00:17:33.797]  Do you have a problem with the radiation from these things?
[00:17:33.797 --> 00:17:37.239]  And if you say yes, two weeks later, you get a pink slip.
[00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:38.219]  Oh, we're laying you off.
[00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:53.653]  So, they're building an army of unthinking automatons who will... Plus, the more I think about it, this is all hidden in plain view.
[00:17:53.653 --> 00:18:07.262]  Those x-ray machines, and I was looking at some of the specs a few months ago, we had a radiologist on air, as many of you remember, that there's all sorts of splattering and leakage out of the regular x-ray machines they run your luggage through that you're walking by.
[00:18:07.262 --> 00:18:09.403]  But it's one thing to walk by it.
[00:18:09.403 --> 00:18:11.285]  It's another thing to sit there all day
[00:18:12.347 --> 00:18:15.890]  On top of it!
[00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.452]  By the way, there's more news out today dealing with the U.S.
[00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:25.297]  government radiating disabled Americans, injecting them with syphilis, injecting them with dioxin.
[00:18:25.297 --> 00:18:32.383]  Of course, you heard last year the government had to apologize for injecting Guatemalans with syphilis.
[00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:38.488]  We have a scientific technocracy with a bunch of ruthless control freaks who get off
[00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.186]  on playing God.
[00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.027]  They're not into football.
[00:18:43.027 --> 00:18:45.068]  They're not into going to parties.
[00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:46.469]  They're not into going out dancing.
[00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:48.030]  They're not into oil painting.
[00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.932]  They're not into gardening.
[00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:53.013]  They're into playing God!
[00:18:53.013 --> 00:19:05.100]  And many of these scientific elite types, if you study their psychological makeup, are classical Joseph Mingala types.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.821]  They enjoy
[00:19:07.884 --> 00:19:08.605]  What they're doing.
[00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:10.126]  They enjoy suffering.
[00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:13.149]  They enjoy playing God.
[00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:23.057]  Now, I started getting into the TSA because that's a segue as the states stand up and say those convicted would be Tier 3 sex offenders.
[00:19:23.057 --> 00:19:24.819]  Because that's what it is.
[00:19:24.819 --> 00:19:27.701]  If I walk up in a park and grab a woman's genitals, I'll go to prison.
[00:19:27.701 --> 00:19:28.502]  It should.
[00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:33.886]  If a cop does it without an emergency situation and probable cause, you know, that she has a gun down her pants,
[00:19:34.827 --> 00:19:36.867]  He's going to go to jail and should.
[00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:39.968]  How are these TSA workers above the law?
[00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:49.790]  But I wanted to get to mention that first because now the TSA is going to be taking your DNA when you go to the airport and then on the side of the highway.
[00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.251]  And as I told you years ago, that's been the plan all along.
[00:19:53.251 --> 00:19:58.192]  They want to set a precedent to forcibly inject you, forcibly take blood, get inside your body.
[00:19:58.192 --> 00:19:58.972]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.913 --> 00:20:04.335]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[00:20:04.335 --> 00:20:12.179]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:16.722]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[00:20:16.722 --> 00:20:18.162]  It is glutathione.
[00:20:18.162 --> 00:20:22.225]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:25.607]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[00:20:26.227 --> 00:20:32.013]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[00:20:32.013 --> 00:20:39.260]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:44.085]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[00:20:45.686 --> 00:20:48.090]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:48.510]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.711]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:20:48.711 --> 00:20:49.993]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[00:20:49.993 --> 00:20:51.154]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:05.663]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:08.925]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:08.925 --> 00:21:13.708]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:20.111]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:22.333]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:23.173]  Tim Geithner?
[00:21:23.173 --> 00:21:23.434]  Bernanke?
[00:21:23.434 --> 00:21:23.894]  They're arsonists!
[00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:24.655]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:26.377]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:41.775 --> 00:21:43.616]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:43.616 --> 00:21:49.058]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:58.241]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:59.912 --> 00:22:01.993]  I'm Roger Rao at Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.993 --> 00:22:09.075]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds, and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[00:22:09.075 --> 00:22:12.276]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.
[00:22:12.276 --> 00:22:16.358]  Get the stability and peace of mind you deserve by investing in precious metals.
[00:22:16.358 --> 00:22:21.119]  Gold and silver have been a form of wealth protection for over 5,000 years all over the world.
[00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:27.361]  If you have seen your hard-earned money lose value because of inflation, sliding dollar, etc., it's time you stop the bleeding.
[00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:28.902]  The answer to your problems is simple.
[00:22:29.722 --> 00:22:30.662]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.077 --> 00:23:02.638]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:03.339]  No kidding!
[00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:07.721]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:10.482]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:13.944]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:23:13.944 --> 00:23:18.967]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[00:23:18.967 --> 00:23:25.870]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.752]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[00:23:29.892 --> 00:23:32.014]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[00:23:32.014 --> 00:23:33.355]  Fit standard mason jars.
[00:23:33.355 --> 00:23:36.738]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.
[00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:39.400]  Place orders at ReusableCanningLids.com or call 1-877-747-2793.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.460]  877-747-2793.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:39.740]  Call 877-747-2793.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.561]  Or go to ReusableCanningLids.com.
[00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:42.583]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids.
[00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:43.604]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:01.115 --> 00:24:03.838]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:03.838 --> 00:24:08.862]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:08.862 --> 00:24:14.908]  All right, coming up, Qaddafi loyalists fail to retake territory in six-hour battle with rebels.
[00:24:14.908 --> 00:24:19.131]  Saudi Arabia sends tanks to riot-hit Bahrain.
[00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:19.932]  Report, U.S.
[00:24:19.932 --> 00:24:22.475]  Special Forces have now arrived in Libya.
[00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:32.995]  In the eastern part of the country, we're going to get into Bernie Madoff's jailhouse interview, saying that the entire government is a Ponzi scheme.
[00:24:32.995 --> 00:24:48.117]  Yep, the Ponzi scheme started in 1913 with the private Federal Reserve takeover, and this whole police state control grid is to ensure that the private Ponzi scheme operators are able to take over this country and secure their ill-gotten gains.
[00:24:48.117 --> 00:24:49.317]  That is coming up.
[00:24:49.317 --> 00:24:52.598]  But again, if you just joined us, the good news is all over the country,
[00:24:54.470 --> 00:25:01.193]  Legislatures are moving to pass laws to make it illegal for TSA to grope you, but it's already illegal.
[00:25:01.193 --> 00:25:04.474]  I've had district attorneys and county attorneys on.
[00:25:04.474 --> 00:25:07.495]  There's no law allowing TSA to do this.
[00:25:07.495 --> 00:25:08.876]  It's a Tenth Amendment violation.
[00:25:08.876 --> 00:25:16.899]  A bunch of federal goons running around doing whatever they want, now expanding the highways and train stations and bus stations of America.
[00:25:17.979 --> 00:25:28.964]  A House committee is scheduled to hold a hearing today on a bill that would make it a sexual assault for an airport screener to touch or view a person's breast or genitals without probable cause.
[00:25:28.964 --> 00:25:38.749]  The bill, HB 628FN, includes anyone working as a security agent of a federal, state, or local government and includes touching or viewing with a technological device.
[00:25:38.749 --> 00:25:41.511]  So that also deals with the body scanners.
[00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:45.613]  The bill, this is in New Hampshire, the bill states
[00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:57.458]  Discussing or possessing a copy of the Constitution, discussing the security apparatus of an airport.
[00:25:57.458 --> 00:26:08.588]  And it continues, being on the premises of an airport, possessing an airplane ticket or any type of ticket for access to mass transportation, driving a motor vehicle on a public way or ownership of firearms should not be considered probable cause.
[00:26:11.829 --> 00:26:16.191]  Anyone convicted of these offenses would be classified as a Tier 3 sexual offender.
[00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:19.173]  Okay, let me just continue here now.
[00:26:19.173 --> 00:26:24.816]  This is old news for our listeners, but new news if you're a new listener.
[00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:26.297]  And this all broke over the weekend.
[00:26:27.297 --> 00:26:32.160]  After touching your junk, TSA wants to scan and harvest your DNA.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.582]  It's not enough for the TSA to fill you up at the airport.
[00:26:35.582 --> 00:26:43.586]  Now they're experimenting with rapid result DNA scanners that can scan and analyze your DNA using just a drop of saliva.
[00:26:43.586 --> 00:26:46.328]  That's because in your saliva are skin cells from the
[00:26:47.228 --> 00:26:47.668]  I don't know.
[00:27:15.911 --> 00:27:21.813]  In there, it said to get a driver's license, they would take urine, blood, or other tissue sample.
[00:27:21.813 --> 00:27:32.877]  And now in England and Europe and in other areas of the world, when the police pull you over, even for speeding, they are now pushing, taking a swab of tissue.
[00:27:32.877 --> 00:27:33.977]  They don't have to cut you to do it.
[00:27:33.977 --> 00:27:39.639]  They just take a swab and put it on the inside of your cheek and it scrapes off hundreds of cells.
[00:27:39.639 --> 00:27:44.001]  They then attach that to your ID in the database and now have your DNA.
[00:27:44.961 --> 00:28:08.659]  Now remember, and this Mike Adams Natural News article points this out, that we wrote a story last year dealing, we wrote a story a decade before that as well, dealing with the fact that we discovered 15 years ago when a nurse sent us secret documents that there is a giant secret DNA Pentagon database and all babies at birth for 39 years
[00:28:10.569 --> 00:28:31.954]  This is done by the way through continuity of agenda for 39 years is generally the number but the last 35 at least some countries didn't start it until after we did but every major Western nation showing we're under this global management system that they take blood from babies telling you it's going to the health department to test for blood diseases as if
[00:28:32.694 --> 00:28:39.696]  A in-house clinic couldn't do it or as if the hospital couldn't charge you and do it and send it out to a private clinic.
[00:28:39.696 --> 00:28:44.918]  They send it away to the health department and the blood test is not done.
[00:28:44.918 --> 00:28:51.600]  It is saved and put into a Pentagon slash UN database.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.461]  And of course now listeners of mine in Minnesota and Texas
[00:28:56.161 --> 00:29:08.414]  Hearing about this actually investigated in the last few years and have been winning lawsuits and basically getting up-to-date documents similar to those we received 15 years ago.
[00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:10.796]  So the goal of government is to get in your space
[00:29:11.397 --> 00:29:20.179]  To set that precedent, to have forced inoculation, as they've been trying to push through the last few years, to have forced DNA retrieval.
[00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:22.099]  It's about government getting in your space.
[00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:27.180]  And they train you, first take your shoes off, take your belt off, answer questions.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.721]  Now we're gonna body scan you, now we're gonna grope you on top of it.
[00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:35.041]  First the hands are outside the pants or the dress, now they're going inside.
[00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:37.802]  Always increasing what they do.
[00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:47.269]  And this is just like people pulling up at a prison and basically being broken and being strip searched.
[00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:49.390]  It's just like induction into a prison.
[00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.951]  We'll come back with more.
[00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:52.352]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.352 --> 00:29:54.873]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.873 --> 00:29:57.575]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.962 --> 00:30:04.545]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:30:04.545 --> 00:30:05.846]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:10.250]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:16.196]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:30:16.196 --> 00:30:18.337]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:30:18.337 --> 00:30:21.020]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.864]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[00:30:27.864 --> 00:30:30.065]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:30:30.065 --> 00:30:35.408]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:30:35.408 --> 00:30:40.690]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:46.073]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:30:46.073 --> 00:30:49.015]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:30:49.255 --> 00:30:52.256]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:52.256 --> 00:30:53.036]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:30:53.036 --> 00:30:53.676]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:53.676 --> 00:30:56.977]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.982]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.982 --> 00:31:16.366]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.366 --> 00:31:19.389]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:21.710]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:27.975]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.975 --> 00:31:31.358]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.358 --> 00:31:36.842]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.102 --> 00:31:38.763]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.044]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.044 --> 00:31:42.725]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.725 --> 00:31:46.947]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:51.570]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.171]  That's endofamerica3.com.

[00:32:01.857 --> 00:32:05.818]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:05.818 --> 00:32:14.680]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.301]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:30.123]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:30.763 --> 00:32:40.265]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.265 --> 00:32:45.707]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:45.707 --> 00:32:53.188]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.188 --> 00:32:55.929]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:00.202 --> 00:33:08.827]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.827 --> 00:33:10.968]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:10.968 --> 00:33:11.529]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:11.529 --> 00:33:16.892]  Central Standard Time, we are here live, back Sundays live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:16.892 --> 00:33:17.832]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:17.832 --> 00:33:21.914]  Max Keiser joining us from Beirut with big breaking news.
[00:33:21.914 --> 00:33:23.796]  We'll be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:33:24.716 --> 00:33:28.940]  We then have Lindsey Williams for part three of that live interview we started about a week and a half ago.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:43.634]  And then Webster Griffin Tarpley, fresh back from Germany, will give us his view on what's happening in the Middle East, North Africa, and with the continuing acceleration of the disintegration of the world economy by design.
[00:33:43.634 --> 00:33:45.596]  That is all coming up.
[00:33:45.596 --> 00:33:46.517]  I want to get into
[00:33:47.796 --> 00:34:02.045]  The move to basically have a NATO, UN-led, US-backed invasion of Tripoli, where Muammar Gaddafi, the dictator, is ensconced.
[00:34:02.045 --> 00:34:03.826]  I want to get into some Bernie Madoff news.
[00:34:03.826 --> 00:34:06.488]  It's very revealing coming up.
[00:34:06.488 --> 00:34:07.708]  Also news on the economy.
[00:34:07.708 --> 00:34:10.610]  But finishing up with the TSA.
[00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:12.591]  The TSA is the national
[00:34:15.006 --> 00:34:22.315]  Low wage, brown shirt, army of the federal government.
[00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:24.518]  And there's this continuity of agenda.
[00:34:24.518 --> 00:34:32.868]  If you want to blame George Herbert Walker Bush, or you want to blame Bill Clinton, or you want to blame George W. Bush, or you want to blame Barack Obama, you can't.
[00:34:34.332 --> 00:34:55.600]  Because their rhetoric may be a little bit different, but if you look at what Homeland Security's doing, itself an offshoot of FEMA and COG, Continuity of Government Preparations, if you look at what presidents do after the last president leaves, the bureaucracy is moving in total lockstep in the same direction.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.262]  And so while we rearrange deck chairs on the deck of the Titanic,
[00:35:01.104 --> 00:35:07.660]  And prepare to put in some Republican savior coming up the next year and a half to remove Barack Obama.
[00:35:09.403 --> 00:35:12.846]  That is a strategy for failure.
[00:35:12.846 --> 00:35:23.896]  If we teach the principles of liberty and freedom and the Constitution generally to the public, tyranny will disappear like mist in the morning, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:35:23.896 --> 00:35:26.338]  Like phantoms at dawn.
[00:35:26.338 --> 00:35:29.701]  And we need to take the states back, the counties, the cities back.
[00:35:29.701 --> 00:35:34.426]  We need to take each mind back by getting people to realize what a decadent, corrupt
[00:35:34.946 --> 00:35:35.106]  I think?
[00:35:47.765 --> 00:35:52.328]  The true free market private property engine of everything good.
[00:35:52.328 --> 00:36:17.225]  We know historically that everything the federal government is attempting to do is for a small cadre of elite, inbred, elitist banking house and royalty allied families who have nothing but disdain for the general public and disdain for private property for the middle class who has always been their hereditary enemy throughout history.
[00:36:17.885 --> 00:36:24.849]  Middle classes are always enemies of the establishment once the system begins to become consolidated and vertically integrated.
[00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:38.977]  Look at ancient Rome, look at ancient Japan, China, look at Mesoamerica, look at what's happened in the last hundred years in the third world, whether it's Africa, Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the corrupt,
[00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:57.302]  Strong men and plutocrats, depending on what system you have, always target the middle class because it's independent and self-sufficient and not under their control and is always in business competition against the consolidated inside crony capitalist ventures run by these systems.
[00:36:57.762 --> 00:37:11.427]  You know, you think the communists are anti-capitalist, but you look at China, you look at Russia and its decline up until the early 1990s, you had a very small group of people becoming fabulously wealthy and powerful.
[00:37:11.427 --> 00:37:17.230]  And they use government as a tool to shut down their competition.
[00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:24.933]  But continuing, this is the last time I can fly out of Austin without them trying to put me through the naked body scanners.
[00:37:25.865 --> 00:37:35.827]  Now the good news is there's been such a revolt against them that all over the country they're in disuse because they don't want to give you a chance to come together.
[00:37:35.827 --> 00:37:47.730]  As I said a year ago, as I said five months ago when we launched the big national brushfire rebellion against this, that it's the key issue for several reasons.
[00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.891]  It is a central key operation for the globalists.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.865]  They must roll out their national civilian security force that's just as big and just as strong as the U.S.
[00:37:58.865 --> 00:38:01.227]  military, as Barack Obama said.
[00:38:01.227 --> 00:38:07.111]  Not his agenda, he's just putting it into high gear.
[00:38:07.111 --> 00:38:17.019]  So it's key because it's key for them, their total federal domination, the end of the 9th and 10th Amendment, ahead of this country going into full bankruptcy receivership.
[00:38:18.035 --> 00:38:20.956]  Forty-two states on the verge of being absorbed by the federal government.
[00:38:20.956 --> 00:38:22.517]  By the way, I wrote his name down.
[00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:23.657]  I put it in my phone.
[00:38:23.657 --> 00:38:39.124]  I've got to pull it back up, but when I flew to New York, the head of one of the biggest banks in the country, investment banks, was sitting next to me in first class.
[00:38:39.124 --> 00:38:41.785]  I demanded the view, give me first class.
[00:38:41.785 --> 00:38:43.025]  It's Disney's money, why not?
[00:38:45.632 --> 00:38:54.500]  He knew who I was and tried to convince me that global government wasn't a bad thing and that we should have a global corporation that runs things.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.785]  Kind of like the speech that Howard Beals given by the head of the company that owns the network in The Network.
[00:39:01.403 --> 00:39:10.726]  He was trying to explain it all to me, and by the end, boy, he gave me that executive power trip look that only a globalist can give.
[00:39:10.726 --> 00:39:12.167]  So I've got to go dig it out of my phone later.
[00:39:12.167 --> 00:39:16.108]  I forget his name, but I kind of knew who he was, and I searched his name after I got off the plane.
[00:39:16.108 --> 00:39:23.151]  I was like, unbelievable who I was sitting next to for three hours.
[00:39:23.151 --> 00:39:25.311]  It was incredible.
[00:39:25.311 --> 00:39:27.392]  But side issue on that front.
[00:39:27.392 --> 00:39:29.473]  Continuing with the TSA, I'll get into all this other news.
[00:39:30.805 --> 00:39:38.403]  It's key because this is their federal, brown shirt, Gestapo, Tenth Amendment destroying takeover.
[00:39:41.557 --> 00:39:44.720]  If we can stop them on this front, we'll stop them on every front.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:54.910]  And if we have political victories, like Washington, George Washington had a military victory at Trenton against the Hessians, it will show people that we have power.
[00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.112]  And we are having more and more victories.
[00:39:57.112 --> 00:40:03.778]  And the people are learning that there's a sport called real politics and called fighting for liberty that's exciting and dynamic.
[00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:18.625]  And a lot more fulfilling than paying $300 to go to an NFL football game and buy glasses of $10 beer and eat hot dogs full of MSG that give you heartburn and to be groped by TSA-trained thugs at the gate.
[00:40:19.738 --> 00:40:23.561]  People find out how fulfilling it is to be informed and involved.
[00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:27.084]  It's addictive to start learning how the world works, tracking information.
[00:40:27.084 --> 00:40:38.333]  And as people begin to more and more discover this, the globalists can feel the energy of the world's intellect and the will turning against them.
[00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:41.816]  So it's key because it's their tip of the spear.
[00:40:43.015 --> 00:40:51.177]  But it's even more key and central and a perfect issue because it's something that isn't left or right.
[00:40:51.177 --> 00:40:55.979]  That's why the media has desperately tried to make it Obama's TSA.
[00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:59.880]  Obama is doing this.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:07.582]  Because if they can make it about Obama, who's certainly a horrible teleprompter reading creature, but nevertheless a puppet, a marionette,
[00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:14.506]  Then they can basically have all the, quote, liberals go, well, my football team's good.
[00:41:14.506 --> 00:41:21.874]  And so I associate my personal power and my identity with Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:41:21.874 --> 00:41:30.183]  And so I'm going to support the TSA then, because it's being phrased by Fox News and others as something that the liberals are doing.
[00:41:31.135 --> 00:41:36.276]  If you notice, Fox News has been critical of the TSA, though they love the Patriot Act, secret arrest, torture.
[00:41:36.276 --> 00:41:38.017]  I mean, this is their game.
[00:41:38.017 --> 00:41:39.337]  This is their bag.
[00:41:39.337 --> 00:41:40.757]  They should love it.
[00:41:40.757 --> 00:41:50.940]  But they're playing the part of the anti-establishment right now, while their arm of the New World Order, their management team, is quasi-out of power.
[00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:52.746]  No, we're good to go.
[00:42:15.026 --> 00:42:15.347]  Of course.
[00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:29.198]  We're just going to play possum until your anger dissipates.
[00:42:29.198 --> 00:42:30.919]  But you notice it's not dissipating.
[00:42:30.919 --> 00:42:36.962]  In the Austin line, in the New Jersey line, I was listening to men and women going, I'm not going to do it.
[00:42:36.962 --> 00:42:38.103]  I'm going to opt out.
[00:42:38.103 --> 00:42:40.364]  And then when they try to touch me, I'm going to say no.
[00:42:40.364 --> 00:42:41.204]  What are we going to do?
[00:42:41.204 --> 00:42:41.985]  What are we going to do?
[00:42:41.985 --> 00:42:50.349]  So I sat there in Austin after I went to the checkpoint and in New Jersey when I got off and when I came back on, watching people.
[00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:51.650]  Almost no pat-downs.
[00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.831]  The ones they did were very light.
[00:42:53.831 --> 00:42:54.752]  No body scanning.
[00:42:56.056 --> 00:43:02.118]  And the TSA was extremely polite.
[00:43:02.118 --> 00:43:09.400]  Except for last night, right as they were closing it down, and I got there and tried to warn them, and of course they didn't want to hear, hey, this radiation's gonna hurt you.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.301]  See, I'm the bad man for telling them that.
[00:43:12.301 --> 00:43:22.584]  It's like if they have a glass of cyanide they're about to drink, and I'm telling them not to drink it, and they just go, shut up, it's good for me.
[00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:29.253]  But, you know, denial, as they say, is not a river in Egypt.
[00:43:30.126 --> 00:43:34.910]  Okay, again, finishing up on that subject, and I gotta hurry because I got all this other news to get to.
[00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.611]  We got guests coming up.
[00:43:36.611 --> 00:43:41.515]  You know, I have that tendency to spend the first 30-45 minutes on one article instead of getting into all the news.
[00:43:41.515 --> 00:43:45.898]  After touching your junk, TSA wants to scan and harvest your DNA.
[00:43:45.898 --> 00:43:52.763]  This is from Mike Adams at Natural News up on InfoWars.com, but it's all over the tech magazines, all over the news.
[00:43:53.924 --> 00:44:04.975]  Uh, here's a TG Daily plans on scanning DNA at checkpoints, uh, where they, uh, basically get cheek tissue by having you spit or swabbing the inside of your cheek.
[00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:14.004]  Uh, and they're saying that they're testing it, uh, to, to, to, to do identity confirmation, uh, and, uh, they are moving forward with that.
[00:44:15.385 --> 00:44:15.565]  I don't
[00:44:33.047 --> 00:44:46.490]  DMV workers of TSA to take tissue samples, just like they have federal grants in the last decade or more, now coming to a head, here in Austin they do it, where they take blood without warrants at checkpoints.
[00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.270]  The police do, under a federal grant.
[00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:55.992]  Medicalizing cadres of police to be medical officers for forced inoculations and more.
[00:44:55.992 --> 00:45:01.653]  Of course, before you needed a medical license as a nurse, but not anymore.
[00:45:03.917 --> 00:45:11.847]  If the police want to groogle around in an RV medical center on the side of I-35, they're going to do it.
[00:45:11.847 --> 00:45:19.057]  And if you don't submit, we've got a lot of cases where if you don't give the blood test, they chain you down and taser you.
[00:45:19.057 --> 00:45:19.417]  Torture.
[00:45:20.356 --> 00:45:20.996]  THX 1138.
[00:45:20.996 --> 00:45:24.818]  Might as well have cattle prods.
[00:45:24.818 --> 00:45:25.698]  Just when you think the U.S.
[00:45:25.698 --> 00:45:30.600]  Department of Homeland Security has enough wonderful toys to keep them busy, they go out and add another.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.421]  Get ready for your DNA screening by DHS.
[00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:37.542]  According to the Daily, DHS has plans to begin testing a portable DNA scanner.
[00:45:37.542 --> 00:45:41.244]  The device has not been revealed, but was reported it resembles a desktop printer.
[00:45:41.244 --> 00:45:47.186]  It is expected to make genetic tests far more common, especially in cases related to refugees, human trafficking, and immigration.
[00:45:47.186 --> 00:45:47.686]  Yeah, sure.
[00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:52.327]  Experts think it will soon make its way into everyday medical and law enforcement usage.
[00:45:52.327 --> 00:45:59.448]  Yeah, like they've got thumb scanners going in almost all the police cars or license plate reading cameras.
[00:45:59.448 --> 00:46:01.029]  Old Pentagon developed.
[00:46:01.029 --> 00:46:02.069]  Here's another one.
[00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:06.510]  DNA genetic pat-down introduced to airports by DHS.
[00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.870]  Here's our article last year.
[00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:11.411]  Newborns' DNA routinely harvested for government biobanks.
[00:46:11.411 --> 00:46:12.471]  Steve Watson.
[00:46:12.471 --> 00:46:13.431]  It's not routinely.
[00:46:14.854 --> 00:46:20.679]  I have, with three children, I've had them threaten me at the hospital and say it's the law.
[00:46:20.679 --> 00:46:21.660]  And I go, show me the law.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.462]  No, it's a mandate to the health department.
[00:46:23.462 --> 00:46:24.663]  You get money for it.
[00:46:24.663 --> 00:46:25.703]  I'm not doing it.
[00:46:25.703 --> 00:46:26.184]  You got it?
[00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:30.928]  And they call an administrator and I say, look, I'm not stupid.
[00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:33.370]  Just like you tell public school kids, it's the law.
[00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:34.831]  You got to take all these shots.
[00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:36.052]  There is no law.
[00:46:36.052 --> 00:46:40.456]  See, I mean, even if you believe in them secretly taking your blood, they lie about it and get caught.
[00:46:41.769 --> 00:46:47.971]  How many years have I been the kook for talking about this when it's just all admitted?
[00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:51.012]  And they get all of us just to play along with our own destruction.
[00:46:51.012 --> 00:46:55.093]  The TSA workers being roasted by these microwaves.
[00:46:55.093 --> 00:47:03.696]  The DHS and National Guard all over the country with giant mobile scanners just standing under them all day just roasting themselves.
[00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:07.457]  And they just think it's magical delusional thinking.
[00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.298]  Oh Alex, you know, we say it's fine.
[00:47:10.219 --> 00:47:10.899]  Here's another one.
[00:47:10.899 --> 00:47:12.940]  The Mail reports.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.540]  America's shocking secret.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.681]  Pictures that show how the U.S.
[00:47:15.681 --> 00:47:19.482]  experimented on its own disabled citizens and prison inmates.
[00:47:19.482 --> 00:47:21.702]  Yeah.
[00:47:21.702 --> 00:47:24.683]  And this is just a whitewash itself.
[00:47:24.683 --> 00:47:28.665]  And of course they always go back to 50, 60 years ago.
[00:47:28.665 --> 00:47:29.945]  This stuff's all going on right now.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:32.961]  I don't think so.
[00:47:47.353 --> 00:47:50.674]  That's some of what we're going to be going over on that front.
[00:47:50.674 --> 00:47:54.536]  But let me go ahead now and get into the situation.
[00:47:54.536 --> 00:48:04.039]  We'll cover this more with Max Keiser coming up and then Webster Griffin Tarpley and also Lindsey Williams today.
[00:48:04.039 --> 00:48:04.400]  U.S.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.241]  titans military grip on Qaddafi.
[00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:15.804]  Naval and air forces close in on Libya as David Cameron plans no-fly zone to protect civilians.
[00:48:17.418 --> 00:48:17.678]  Yeah.
[00:48:34.427 --> 00:48:59.708]  against these uh... disgusting uh... king rats uh... but at the same time uh... meet the new boss same as the old boss when they're done they'll just put something even worse in place that's all part of this domino effect to uh... not just uh... fall in the middle east or north africa but all over the world uh... we're gonna see this continued uh... upheaval uh... unfolding they want no fly zones to shoot down any aircraft
[00:49:00.228 --> 00:49:00.689]  I don't think so.
[00:49:16.351 --> 00:49:20.713]  You got a turban on your head, you got an AK-47, they're gonna go ahead and kill you.
[00:49:20.713 --> 00:49:26.237]  They say it's acceptable to kill several hundred people at a wedding or in a market to kill one bad guy.
[00:49:26.237 --> 00:49:28.078]  No judge, no jury.
[00:49:28.078 --> 00:49:32.540]  It's just a robot drone, you know, drops a hellfire missile on you.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.541]  But that's good, though.
[00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:40.705]  See, when the people running our country torture somebody or murder a crowd of people to kill one person, that's good.
[00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:52.594]  But when somebody else does it, there's all this moralizing and hyperventilating, and oh my gosh, Gaddafi is such a monster, oh my goodness gracious gumdrops.
[00:49:52.594 --> 00:49:54.675]  This is just terrible.
[00:49:54.675 --> 00:49:59.419]  And the aircraft carriers are mashing, and NATO's gearing up, and oh, they're now, U.S.
[00:49:59.419 --> 00:50:02.381]  Special Forces are there reportedly backing the rebels.
[00:50:03.493 --> 00:50:08.738]  Gaddafi has again failed to retake territory in a six-hour battle with rebels.
[00:50:08.738 --> 00:50:20.889]  Libyan soldiers and paramilitary loyal to Muammar Gaddafi attempted Tuesday to retake territory that has been seized by rebels but neither side appeared to gain ground according to accounts of the fighting from residents.
[00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:26.716]  Uh, and officials, uh, with the opposition movement, the Washington Post, uh, reports.
[00:50:26.716 --> 00:50:30.941]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's detailed report at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:30.941 --> 00:50:31.682]  Report, U.S.
[00:50:31.682 --> 00:50:34.024]  Special Forces arrive in Libya.
[00:50:34.024 --> 00:50:35.005]  Yeah, they arrived.
[00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:38.929]  It's like saying the Mayflower just arrived two days ago.
[00:50:38.929 --> 00:50:42.973]  Uh, they've been there the whole time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.435]  Uh, and that's on record.
[00:50:44.435 --> 00:50:49.920]  It's like they've been in, uh, inside Iran for the last decade, uh, stirring things up.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.542]  Most Americans strongly oppose U.S.
[00:50:51.542 --> 00:50:53.203]  military action in Libya.
[00:50:53.203 --> 00:50:55.065]  Well, what did Gates say a few months ago?
[00:50:55.065 --> 00:50:56.106]  He said about Afghanistan.
[00:50:56.106 --> 00:50:59.029]  He said, I don't care if almost 70% of Americans don't want us to be there.
[00:50:59.029 --> 00:51:00.170]  I don't care what you want.
[00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:05.452]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:05.452 --> 00:51:06.352]  Number 1.
[00:51:06.352 --> 00:51:09.793]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:09.793 --> 00:51:10.653]  Number 2.
[00:51:10.653 --> 00:51:15.534]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.534 --> 00:51:16.274]  It's true.
[00:51:16.274 --> 00:51:21.155]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:21.155 --> 00:51:21.975]  Number 3.
[00:51:21.975 --> 00:51:25.556]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.556 --> 00:51:29.257]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:29.477 --> 00:51:30.278]  Number 4.
[00:51:30.278 --> 00:51:33.040]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.723]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:36.723 --> 00:51:37.503]  Number 5.
[00:51:37.503 --> 00:51:41.646]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:41.646 --> 00:51:46.410]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:50.851]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:50.851 --> 00:51:52.652]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:51:52.652 --> 00:51:54.892]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:51:57.513 --> 00:52:03.055]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:52:03.055 --> 00:52:05.236]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:52:05.236 --> 00:52:08.577]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.577 --> 00:52:13.298]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.678 --> 00:52:18.181]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.181 --> 00:52:20.522]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.522 --> 00:52:23.424]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.424 --> 00:52:26.325]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.325 --> 00:52:33.930]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.269 --> 00:52:39.553]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.553 --> 00:52:42.515]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.515 --> 00:52:46.198]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.198 --> 00:52:47.279]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.279 --> 00:52:48.600]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.101]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:00.256 --> 00:53:04.940]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:24.112 --> 00:54:32.504]  Okay, we're gonna get Max Keiser on right at the start of the next hour from Beirut.
[00:54:32.504 --> 00:54:35.748]  They're in Lebanon.
[00:54:35.748 --> 00:54:38.733]  Continuing with the situation, we've got a big
[00:54:39.659 --> 00:54:40.380]  We're good to go.
[00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:14.380]  Around half of their earnings in places like Egypt are spent on fuel and food, basic subsistence necessities.
[00:55:15.703 --> 00:55:23.765]  And so the climate is now there and it's like a controlled burn when you know a forest fire is coming to try to control the outcome of that.
[00:55:23.765 --> 00:55:26.526]  And that's basically part of the equation.
[00:55:26.526 --> 00:55:29.246]  But we'll get more into it with Max Keiser.
[00:55:29.246 --> 00:55:35.588]  We'll get more into it with Pastor Lindsey Williams from his big oil company Inside Connections.
[00:55:35.588 --> 00:55:36.908]  And we'll get more into it with
[00:55:37.389 --> 00:55:40.534]  Webster, Griffin, Tarpley coming up today.
[00:55:40.534 --> 00:55:45.503]  But important report by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com.
[00:55:45.503 --> 00:55:45.724]  U.S.
[00:55:45.724 --> 00:55:48.469]  Special Forces arrive in Libya.
[00:55:49.449 --> 00:55:50.950]  Another war.
[00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:52.852]  Another proxy war.
[00:55:52.852 --> 00:55:53.072]  U.S.
[00:55:53.072 --> 00:56:07.343]  Special Forces have reportedly landed in Libya to train anti-Qadhafi rebels as a Western-backed coup d'etat on the oil-rich nation nears, with British and French defense advisers, that's in quotes, also arriving to set up training bases in the rebel-controlled eastern region of the country.
[00:56:07.343 --> 00:56:08.544]  This is global empire.
[00:56:09.355 --> 00:56:10.796]  Neocolonialism.
[00:56:10.796 --> 00:56:23.021]  According to a report in the Pakistan Observer, hundreds of Special Forces personnel from the US, Britain and France arrived February 23rd and 24th in American and French warships and small naval boats off Libyan ports.
[00:56:23.021 --> 00:56:24.722]  It continues.
[00:56:24.722 --> 00:56:29.224]  So we're going to continue to break that down and see if that's true, but we've seen all the indicators that it is.
[00:56:29.844 --> 00:56:35.328]  And we know that that country's been riddled with globalist spies and operatives for a long time.
[00:56:35.328 --> 00:56:38.911]  Again, Kurt Nemo's article reports that most Americans strongly oppose U.S.
[00:56:38.911 --> 00:56:40.172]  military action in Libya.
[00:56:40.172 --> 00:56:44.956]  According to Rasmussen, a large majority of Americans agree with the common sense of George Washington.
[00:56:44.956 --> 00:56:50.260]  During his farewell address, the first president of the United States said the nation should beware of foreign entanglements.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:58.186]  On February 23rd, Rasmussen reported that 67% of Americans strongly believe the United States should stay out of Libya and the Middle East.
[00:56:58.806 --> 00:57:00.587]  Similar numbers want us out of Afghanistan.
[00:57:00.587 --> 00:57:03.529]  But again, Gates, Secretary of Defense, says he doesn't care.
[00:57:03.529 --> 00:57:08.593]  The globalists, their hand-picked government in the District of Criminals and the Pentagon are not listening.
[00:57:08.593 --> 00:57:12.976]  They have dispatched the USS Enterprise and other warships to the waters off Libya.
[00:57:12.976 --> 00:57:22.322]  The Enterprise was conveniently close, having squandered millions of taxpayer dollars confronting ragtag pirates, millions, how about billions, off the Somali coast.
[00:57:23.183 --> 00:57:31.330]  The Pentagon will not confirm one way or the other if it's instructions to set up a no-fly zone and begin bombing the North African nation.
[00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:35.234]  According to Colonel David Lappin, a Pentagon spokesman, the U.S.
[00:57:35.234 --> 00:57:38.517]  military is moving ships closer to Libya in case they are needed.
[00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:42.067]  Here's the London Independent reporting.
[00:57:42.067 --> 00:57:46.712]  The price of food, as I mentioned earlier, is at the heart of this wave of revolutions.
[00:57:46.712 --> 00:57:48.453]  No one saw the uprisings coming.
[00:57:48.453 --> 00:57:50.936]  Really, we said exactly what was going to happen four months ago.
[00:57:50.936 --> 00:57:53.519]  But their deeper cause isn't hard to fathom.
[00:57:54.469 --> 00:57:57.470]  And it goes over the numbers.
[00:57:57.470 --> 00:58:00.151]  Here's a Paul Watson article also dealing with what's happening.
[00:58:00.151 --> 00:58:02.512]  Obama encircles U.S.
[00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:07.373]  war machine around Libya, going through all the details on that front.
[00:58:07.373 --> 00:58:11.635]  Saudi activists eye protest, wait for new cabinet.
[00:58:11.635 --> 00:58:18.897]  The Saudi king's handed out $37 million in return for medical treatment in Europe to try to keep his country from falling.
[00:58:20.299 --> 00:58:21.379]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:21.379 --> 00:58:22.940]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:56.063]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:56.063 --> 00:58:59.306]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.306 --> 00:59:04.110]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:10.495]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.495 --> 00:59:12.737]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.277 --> 00:59:13.577]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.577 --> 00:59:14.078]  Bernanke?
[00:59:14.078 --> 00:59:14.758]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.758 --> 00:59:15.859]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.859 --> 00:59:18.280]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.292]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.292 --> 00:59:39.456]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.456 --> 00:59:53.729]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.729 --> 00:59:56.131]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.131 --> 00:59:58.894]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.543 --> 01:00:10.366]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.366 --> 01:00:11.948]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.948 --> 01:00:13.509]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:17.692]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.692 --> 01:00:21.755]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.317 --> 01:00:26.258]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:26.258 --> 01:00:32.022]  If your station just dialed us in, it is Tuesday, the first day of March, 2011.
[01:00:32.022 --> 01:00:37.607]  We've got Max Keiser joining us here in a few minutes from...
[01:00:40.276 --> 01:00:42.379]  Lebanon, they're in Beirut.
[01:00:42.379 --> 01:00:47.367]  We've got Pastor Lindsey Williams live joining us, part three of the interview we started a few weeks ago.
[01:00:47.367 --> 01:00:53.796]  We've got Webster Griffin Tarpley on the economy and what's happening in the Middle East, North Africa in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[01:00:56.079 --> 01:01:04.067]  I also want to get, if Kaiser wants to talk about it as a side issue, Bernie Madoff coming out and telling the truth, says whole government is a Ponzi scheme.
[01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:05.648]  Well, this is the founder of the Nasdaq.
[01:01:05.648 --> 01:01:06.729]  They're going, oh, well, he's a crook.
[01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:07.370]  Don't listen to him.
[01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.653]  Well, I don't need Bernie Madoff to tell me the whole government's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:01:10.653 --> 01:01:15.198]  Since the 1913 takeover of the Federal Reserve, it's devalued our currency almost down to nothing.
[01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:25.124]  And no matter how much we put into it, how much tax money, how many unions we cut, it's all just putting perfume on a pig, putting lipstick on a pig.
[01:01:25.124 --> 01:01:26.145]  It does nothing.
[01:01:26.145 --> 01:01:33.494]  You get rid of fractional reserve banking, you have Congress take back control of the issuance of currency and credit, and we follow Ron Paul's plan.
[01:01:34.215 --> 01:01:35.456]  And we can fix it.
[01:01:35.456 --> 01:01:38.058]  If you don't, we're gonna be just like every other third world country.
[01:01:38.058 --> 01:01:41.962]  And that's the globalist system to bring us into economic bondage.
[01:01:41.962 --> 01:01:52.691]  And Joseph Stiglitz, when he quit the World Bank in 2002, the documents got leaked, we're not saying he did it, where the IMF and World Bank cold-bloodedly planned this for third world countries, as well as the West.
[01:01:53.391 --> 01:02:00.502]  But joining us now from Beirut is Max Keiser on the situation in Lebanon.
[01:02:00.502 --> 01:02:03.928]  We're starting to see rockets being fired again.
[01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:07.713]  We've seen confirmed media reports of Blackwater, now XC.
[01:02:08.835 --> 01:02:14.500]  Working with the biggest mercenary firm out of South Africa, in North Africa, in Somalia.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:20.425]  Max says he has intel on Blackwater trading in Israel and planning a strike on Lebanon.
[01:02:20.425 --> 01:02:25.730]  Remember, a year before Iceland fell to the bankers, Max predicted it because he had inside sources.
[01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:27.251]  He didn't predict it, he knew it.
[01:02:27.251 --> 01:02:28.652]  So we have to listen to Max.
[01:02:28.652 --> 01:02:30.894]  Max, good to have you here with us.
[01:02:30.894 --> 01:02:32.656]  Alex Jones, welcome to be back.
[01:02:32.656 --> 01:02:35.258]  Yes, I'm here in sunny Beirut, Lebanon.
[01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:43.464]  And the word on the street is that we're waiting to hear about indictments from the U.N.
[01:02:43.464 --> 01:02:55.968]  relating to the Hariri assassination in 2005 and that Israel is setting up some blackwater operatives to come in on the back of that announcement and start trouble again.
[01:02:56.748 --> 01:03:01.070]  Well, can you, I mean, do you have anything that's bonafide or it's just your sources on the street?
[01:03:24.144 --> 01:03:24.924]  Well, that's the buzz.
[01:03:24.924 --> 01:03:26.545]  You know, this is just two years ago.
[01:03:26.545 --> 01:03:34.249]  There was 80 people got shot down dead in the middle of this two blocks from where I'm staying as part of a sectarian uprising.
[01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:41.492]  You know, Hezbollah is trying to protect the interests of Lebanon and Israel, of course.
[01:03:42.232 --> 01:03:46.173]  And their allies are trying to tear the country apart.
[01:03:46.173 --> 01:03:51.194]  So, there's always a ready state of alertness, I would say, in the city of Beirut.
[01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:57.676]  It's funny, because you go down the street right now, everything is calm and quiet, but beneath the surface, it can explode at any second.
[01:03:57.676 --> 01:04:01.437]  So it gives this town a unique feeling, a unique buzz.
[01:04:03.035 --> 01:04:15.300]  All right, I want to come back from break and get into why is Max Keiser RT host, Al Jazeera host, BBC host, Genesis Saturday Morning Radio host.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.581]  Why are you in Lebanon?
[01:04:17.581 --> 01:04:18.681]  Why are you in Beirut?
[01:04:18.681 --> 01:04:21.743]  We're going to come back here in a moment, so don't start yet.
[01:04:21.743 --> 01:04:28.965]  And then I want to shift gears into just the larger geopolitical area that you're nesting in right now, Max.
[01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:29.786]  I want to talk about
[01:04:30.686 --> 01:04:46.629]  Your view on what's happening in Egypt, what's happening in Tripoli with Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, the tanks rolling out to suppress people in the streets in Bahrain and other areas of Saudi Arabia.
[01:04:46.629 --> 01:04:54.551]  I want to get your view on all of that and then Bernie Madoff's jailhouse interview saying the whole government's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:04:54.551 --> 01:04:58.332]  Swindler tells New York Magazine, I destroyed our family.
[01:04:58.332 --> 01:04:58.932]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:05.276]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.196]  Number 1.
[01:05:06.196 --> 01:05:09.618]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:10.478]  Number 2.
[01:05:10.478 --> 01:05:15.360]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.100]  It's true.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:20.983]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:21.803]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.803 --> 01:05:25.384]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.384 --> 01:05:29.086]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.286 --> 01:05:30.086]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.086 --> 01:05:32.848]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.848 --> 01:05:36.529]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.529 --> 01:05:37.329]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.329 --> 01:05:41.471]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:46.513]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.513 --> 01:05:50.695]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.695 --> 01:05:52.476]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.476 --> 01:05:57.078]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:06:00.559 --> 01:06:01.720]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:08.663]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.663 --> 01:06:11.204]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.204 --> 01:06:16.587]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.587 --> 01:06:19.648]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.648 --> 01:06:21.709]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.949 --> 01:06:28.193]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:31.575]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.575 --> 01:06:37.358]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.358 --> 01:06:38.999]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.999 --> 01:06:40.300]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.981]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:44.382]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:06:44.662 --> 01:06:47.184]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.184 --> 01:06:51.808]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:54.411]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:57.413]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.034]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:07:00.524 --> 01:07:04.087]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.228]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:09.791]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:15.735]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:07:15.735 --> 01:07:17.897]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:07:17.897 --> 01:07:20.559]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:07:20.919 --> 01:07:27.402]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:27.402 --> 01:07:29.623]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:07:29.623 --> 01:07:34.966]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:40.248]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:07:40.248 --> 01:07:45.611]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:07:45.611 --> 01:07:48.552]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:07:48.812 --> 01:07:51.715]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:51.715 --> 01:07:52.556]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:52.556 --> 01:07:55.119]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.700]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.043]  He's a filmmaker, broadcaster, former broker, and options trader.
[01:08:24.043 --> 01:08:28.247]  He's known for the invention of virtual specialist technology in the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[01:08:42.058 --> 01:08:44.000]  And he's also known for his very accurate predictions.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:54.527]  I remember him three years ago, along with many other economists and financial researchers we have on, saying as the dollar devalues, as the world reserve currency, it's going to trigger food riots.
[01:08:54.527 --> 01:08:56.388]  And we've been seeing those intensify.
[01:08:56.388 --> 01:09:00.571]  That clearly is one of the main ingredients in the political atmosphere.
[01:09:00.571 --> 01:09:06.875]  But there's clear evidence that the globalists have decided themselves to trigger it so they can try to control it.
[01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:09.557]  Max, why are you in Lebanon?
[01:09:09.557 --> 01:09:11.338]  You wanted to go see all this for yourself?
[01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.479]  Money in motion!
[01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:17.101]  Money is in motion, Alex Jones.
[01:09:17.101 --> 01:09:24.624]  You've got revolutions happening all over the region, North Africa, Middle East, and there's billions of dollars moving around.
[01:09:24.624 --> 01:09:31.868]  And I'm talking with people, meeting with bankers, meeting with fund managers and high net worth individuals, convincing them to buy silver.
[01:09:32.388 --> 01:09:35.911]  And gold, but principally silver, as part of the war against J.P.
[01:09:35.911 --> 01:09:37.472]  Morgan to crash J.P.
[01:09:37.472 --> 01:09:38.633]  Morgan and buy silver.
[01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.656]  So I'm talking to people who represent billions and billions of dollars.
[01:09:41.656 --> 01:09:43.197]  I'm going to Cairo tomorrow.
[01:09:43.197 --> 01:09:46.179]  And you can see the price of silver hit a new 30-year high today.
[01:09:46.179 --> 01:09:49.121]  Gold is hovering at a new all-time high today.
[01:09:49.121 --> 01:09:52.404]  It's the global insurrection against banker occupation.
[01:09:52.404 --> 01:09:55.807]  When I explain to these people in Cairo and in Beirut and across the region,
[01:09:56.127 --> 01:09:58.209]  So what do you see being behind all this then right now?
[01:10:12.659 --> 01:10:12.959]  J.P.
[01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:13.640]  Morgan.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:13.940]  J.P.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:22.364]  Morgan and Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street banks, are behind all of the puppet regimes because they milk them for all they're worth.
[01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:29.008]  So now that this money is in motion, because anytime you've got regime change, as you have, people are moving lots of money.
[01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:39.674]  And by the way, you know, I was on your show last, six months ago, when the UPS scandal hit and the Credit Suisse scandal hit, about how these banks in Switzerland were caught
[01:10:40.174 --> 01:10:42.295]  Well, hiding money and laundering money.
[01:10:42.295 --> 01:10:48.796]  I said at the time, six months ago, I don't know if you remember this, but I said at the time that a lot of that money was going to go to Tel Aviv.
[01:10:48.796 --> 01:11:05.061]  It just came out today in the Financial Times, you can look it up, that in fact now Tel Aviv has been mentioned as the primary source of where those funds have gone after all the UBS bankers advised their clients to get out of Switzerland and to put into Tel Aviv.
[01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:08.662]  So Tel Aviv emerged as the new money laundering Switzerland.
[01:11:09.162 --> 01:11:13.724]  But anytime you've got regime change like you do now, it's billions are in motion.
[01:11:13.724 --> 01:11:17.906]  So I know from my years on Wall Street, that's the sweet spot.
[01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:22.187]  That's the best time to go in and pitch people as to where that money should go.
[01:11:22.187 --> 01:11:30.150]  So I'm telling people, directing this into precious metals, gold and silver, as a way to overthrow the master regime.
[01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:32.991]  JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, the regime of the regime.
[01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:33.972]  This is the way to take it down.
[01:11:34.572 --> 01:11:43.205]  And we're seeing, for example, in Italy, another big story that just came out, I don't know if you saw it, but bankers in Italy are now asking the government to go back to a gold standard.
[01:11:43.205 --> 01:11:44.326]  Yes, I did see that.
[01:11:44.326 --> 01:11:49.694]  What do you make of last week the Egyptian government moving to ban people taking gold out of the country?
[01:11:51.365 --> 01:11:58.275]  Well, this is, like I said, there's huge currents, cross currents, and money is in motion.
[01:11:58.275 --> 01:12:07.869]  So the people with the most money, of course, they don't respect boundaries much, but they've got incredible buying power.
[01:12:08.109 --> 01:12:09.269]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:12:09.269 --> 01:12:18.912]  We know that it's these big globalist interests that have, you know, used Switzerland, the Caymans and other, Luxembourg, other areas as safe havens to hide their money.
[01:12:18.912 --> 01:12:27.714]  I've noticed most of the people they've been targeting are folks that have hidden 5, 10, 15, 20 million, which sounds like a lot to you or I or the average Joe, but it's chicken feed.
[01:12:27.714 --> 01:12:30.615]  So they're really not targeting the people that are hiding billions.
[01:12:31.315 --> 01:12:34.396]  But we do see the Israel lobby and others.
[01:12:34.396 --> 01:12:40.218]  I've noticed a lot of their senators and house members have been really pushing to go after Switzerland.
[01:12:40.218 --> 01:12:49.981]  Is that so they can knock them out as the main money laundering slash tax haven and make Israel the new tax haven?
[01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:53.182]  I mean, is that just basically Israel trying to knock out their competition?
[01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:53.951]  Yeah.
[01:12:53.951 --> 01:12:54.351]  No, you said that.
[01:12:54.351 --> 01:12:55.192]  You even wrote about it.
[01:12:55.192 --> 01:12:56.032]  You said that, yeah.
[01:12:56.032 --> 01:12:57.133]  Your own record, Max.
[01:13:25.412 --> 01:13:25.852]  We're good to go.
[01:13:42.103 --> 01:13:43.704]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:13:43.704 --> 01:13:45.144]  Again, we're not tooting our horn here.
[01:13:45.144 --> 01:13:47.025]  We're calling it exactly like it is.
[01:13:47.025 --> 01:13:54.248]  In Obama deception and fall of the republic, which you're in, we all call it financial terrorism.
[01:13:54.248 --> 01:14:02.592]  We broke here first when we got the congressman on from California, Brad Sherman.
[01:14:03.532 --> 01:14:27.104]  He came on the show then later Senator Inhofe confirmed And that's what I was arguing with this big banker on the airplane about with when I flew to New York this weekend He was saying well Paulson meant we would have martial law if things collapsed No, they went to the House and Senate in closed-door meetings Paulson Bernanke and others and said we will have total implosion we will have martial law if you don't do this and then
[01:14:27.924 --> 01:14:37.101]  When Congress was getting 1,000-to-1 phone calls, and that's what Barbara Boxer reported, or was it Feinstein, 1,000-to-1 phone calls against the banker bailout takeover.
[01:14:38.526 --> 01:14:50.130]  It was on record that the head of the Treasury, the head of the private Fed, they all went out and said, it's over, depression, and destroyed confidence themselves and engaged in financial terrorism.
[01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:56.212]  Then last year, you called it, that thousand point drop in a day was a shot across the bow.
[01:14:56.212 --> 01:15:01.634]  And now the Pentagon's saying, oh my gosh, that was financial terrorism, but they're going to claim that the Easter Bunny did it.
[01:15:02.312 --> 01:15:07.259]  They're claiming it came from the Mideast, Islamic States, or the Chinese military.
[01:15:07.259 --> 01:15:17.654]  It says right here in the story, sufficient justification to question whether outside forces triggered the 2008 using financial terrorism coming from the Middle East states, Islamic terrorists, or Chinese military.
[01:15:17.654 --> 01:15:21.395]  Well, the same thing six months ago with Stuxnet.
[01:15:21.395 --> 01:15:22.275]  Israel and the U.S.
[01:15:22.275 --> 01:15:33.599]  bragged that they jointly developed the Stuxnet, but then I see headlines, government says we must have cyber security act that takes over the web, the internet kill switch, because of things like Stuxnet when they launched it.
[01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:37.879]  Well, who has the most advanced financial terrorist weapons in the world?
[01:15:37.879 --> 01:15:48.444]  It's Wall Street, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading, all of the things that caused the crash of 2008, as we talked about on your show, were the result of
[01:15:49.725 --> 01:15:52.186]  By crashing the system on purpose.
[01:15:52.186 --> 01:15:54.887]  It wasn't something that came out of nowhere.
[01:15:54.887 --> 01:15:56.127]  It wasn't economic.
[01:15:56.127 --> 01:15:59.608]  It was an act of financial terrorism, and we've seen it since.
[01:15:59.608 --> 01:16:04.270]  And now the Pentagon, in this report, is calling it for what it is, acts of financial terrorism.
[01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:07.591]  They mistakenly point the figure to outside forces.
[01:16:07.591 --> 01:16:13.893]  They need to point the finger at what's happening internally on Wall Street, because that's the source of it.
[01:16:15.225 --> 01:16:30.479]  Max, you'll be reporting for us more in the next few days when you get to Egypt, but what do you make of the jailhouse interview that New York Magazine broke over the weekend where Madoff says whole government is a Ponzi scheme, Goldman Sachs is a Ponzi scheme?
[01:16:30.479 --> 01:16:32.701]  We don't need Madoff to tell us that.
[01:16:32.701 --> 01:16:33.982]  He is the founder of the Nasdaq.
[01:16:35.503 --> 01:16:49.367]  Well, what he's done is small fry compared to the 1,500 quadrillion in derivatives created that they've gotten us to basically underwrite with our tax money, with our labor.
[01:16:49.367 --> 01:16:53.588]  I mean, Bernie Madoff is talking about the trillion ton elephant here in the living room.
[01:16:55.118 --> 01:16:59.042]  It's counterfeiting.
[01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:04.766]  The Ponzi scheme, at least it starts off with a dollar and then you go through a Ponzi scheme.
[01:17:04.766 --> 01:17:08.029]  But there's something at the end of the day that started the Ponzi scheme.
[01:17:08.029 --> 01:17:10.531]  But this is actually just rank counterfeiting.
[01:17:10.531 --> 01:17:10.771]  U.S.
[01:17:10.771 --> 01:17:12.653]  Treasury bonds are being counterfeited.
[01:17:12.653 --> 01:17:15.715]  They're being issued with no collateral whatsoever.
[01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:19.258]  There's nothing in the piggy bank to justify any of the issuance of these
[01:17:19.739 --> 01:17:31.695]  And now, and now instead of the Ponzi scheme operator going to prison like Madoff, the bankers hold you hostage at the end of the Ponzi scheme and say give us everything and then we'll fix it, but then it always only gets worse.
[01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:33.878]  I mean, how many times can they pull off this trick?
[01:17:35.325 --> 01:17:41.486]  Well, I mean, okay, just to, if you want to do a search for a story, just looking at here, it's called The Counterfeit Economy.
[01:17:41.486 --> 01:17:43.307]  And it just goes into these very details.
[01:17:43.307 --> 01:17:45.927]  It's a great story that just came out in the last half an hour.
[01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:55.910]  But it just talks about the fact that at the core of this economy, this financial system, you've got what basically are counterfeit operations, counterfeit U.S.
[01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:56.530]  Treasury bonds.
[01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:57.450]  How long can it go on?
[01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:05.918]  Well, if you look at the price, the dollar is moving sharply lower and precious metals are moving sharply higher.
[01:18:05.918 --> 01:18:07.019]  That's your litmus test.
[01:18:07.019 --> 01:18:09.801]  That's your barometer of how long it can go on.
[01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:14.045]  Gold keeps going higher because the world is saying, we don't want your counterfeit money anymore.
[01:18:14.045 --> 01:18:14.966]  So it's going higher.
[01:18:14.966 --> 01:18:17.729]  Are the banksters approaching their water loop?
[01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:26.441]  Well, I think that, as I've said on your show many times before, that the day will come, when the announcement is made, that the U.S.
[01:18:26.441 --> 01:18:37.650]  dollar is devalued by 50 or 60 percent in one day, and the gold will be a lot higher, 3, 4, 5 thousand dollars an ounce, and then, you know, it'll be too late to do anything at that time.
[01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:43.555]  But, it'll happen in, it always, these types of devaluations, if you look historically, they happen overnight.
[01:18:43.555 --> 01:18:48.059]  They don't talk about it for six months and decide... Well, it incrementally happens and then comes to a head.
[01:18:48.817 --> 01:18:51.720]  What about last week when they had a Treasury auction and people didn't buy?
[01:19:09.577 --> 01:19:10.517]  The U.S.
[01:19:10.517 --> 01:19:12.338]  government issues bonds, and then the U.S.
[01:19:12.338 --> 01:19:14.839]  government buys its own bonds.
[01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:24.802]  Also, this rally in the Dow Jones, for example, if you look at the ratio of insiders buying to selling, something like $200 million worth of insiders bought,
[01:19:25.538 --> 01:19:28.781]  Billions, tens of billions sold in the last quarter.
[01:19:28.781 --> 01:19:30.763]  Insiders are getting out of this market.
[01:19:30.763 --> 01:19:38.669]  The only thing keeping the Dow Jones up to where the levels are now are the artificial buying by bots and algorithmic trading on the floor of the exchange.
[01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:40.311]  Again, acts of financial terrorism.
[01:19:40.311 --> 01:19:41.772]  There's no other way to describe it.
[01:19:41.772 --> 01:19:45.515]  Max, stay there because when we come back I want to get to the key here and that is
[01:19:46.954 --> 01:19:58.892]  All the propaganda, the pre-preparatory brainwashing I'm seeing, is ahead of a Chinese-slash-Al Qaeda attack on the stock market, blaming the dollar devaluation on the imaginary cavemen.
[01:19:58.892 --> 01:19:59.674]  We'll come back.
[01:20:01.351 --> 01:20:05.452]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:09.953]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:09.953 --> 01:20:16.114]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:16.114 --> 01:20:18.535]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.535 --> 01:20:24.496]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:24.636 --> 01:20:28.041]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:29.903]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:29.903 --> 01:20:32.106]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:32.106 --> 01:20:36.972]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:51.828]  800-477-9256 or zerodetguarantee.com.
[01:20:51.828 --> 01:20:53.069]  America, you've been warned.
[01:21:09.881 --> 01:21:13.263]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[01:21:13.263 --> 01:21:16.946]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[01:21:16.946 --> 01:21:17.746]  Have you?
[01:21:17.746 --> 01:21:29.054]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[01:21:29.054 --> 01:21:30.235]  Could this really happen?
[01:21:30.235 --> 01:21:34.237]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:35.418]  He was among the first to predict the
[01:21:42.671 --> 01:21:43.051]  I don't know.
[01:22:00.632 --> 01:22:03.594]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:03.594 --> 01:22:07.756]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.017]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:10.017 --> 01:22:15.180]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.001]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:17.001 --> 01:22:18.542]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:20.023]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:23.085]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:23.385 --> 01:22:28.770]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:38.118]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[01:23:56.779 --> 01:23:58.879]  Lecig, for today's modern smoker.
[01:24:27.386 --> 01:24:30.010]  Yeah, it's sundown on the union.
[01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:39.943]  It's gonna be sundown on the union if we don't get involved and get informed and let people know who the authors of our misery are.
[01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:42.908]  I'm sure it's us for letting these corrupt banksters get in place.
[01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:51.883]  But they are the prime movers with the intelligent evil consciously doing what they're doing.
[01:24:51.883 --> 01:24:54.507]  You know, democracy doesn't rule the world.
[01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:56.350]  You better get that through your head.
[01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:58.633]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:24:58.633 --> 01:24:59.154]  But I better...
[01:25:00.015 --> 01:25:05.059]  Have that left unsaid, as, of course, the immortal Bob Dylan would say.
[01:25:05.059 --> 01:25:07.862]  You're going to be back on with us, 30 minutes, on Thursday.
[01:25:07.862 --> 01:25:10.664]  Graciously, Max Geiser, maxgeiser.com.
[01:25:10.664 --> 01:25:17.110]  But you can really see him getting ready and saying, oh, we're going to have a recession now.
[01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.750]  We never left it.
[01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:20.933]  We're in a depression because of what's happening in the Middle East.
[01:25:20.933 --> 01:25:23.115]  And now they're saying, oh, there may be a cyber attack.
[01:25:23.655 --> 01:25:28.416]  Or even a solar flare that knocks out the satellites and destroys the stock market.
[01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:35.279]  They're really introducing into the public mind that there's going to be this big financial attack and it's going to cause the depression.
[01:25:35.279 --> 01:25:41.941]  And then they'll tell all the yuppies that and then they'll hate brown men in caves for losing their 401ks.
[01:25:41.941 --> 01:25:42.681]  What do you see happening?
[01:25:43.581 --> 01:25:58.002]  I see the people in Wisconsin who are revolting against the corrupt governor there, joining forces with people in the other nations that are in state of revolution as part of the global insurrection.
[01:25:58.002 --> 01:25:59.404]  So, in Madison, Wisconsin,
[01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:00.725]  Well, Max, I think it's more
[01:26:25.987 --> 01:26:27.788]  Wherever I go, I go to him in Beirut.
[01:26:27.788 --> 01:26:31.409]  I meet people in the cafe who pull out a silver dollar.
[01:26:31.409 --> 01:26:32.170]  They know the story.
[01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:33.610]  They said, I bought my silver, Max.
[01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:35.471]  We're going to crush JPMorgan.
[01:26:35.471 --> 01:26:37.132]  This is in Beirut, Lebanon.
[01:26:37.132 --> 01:26:40.533]  I expect to hear the same thing in Cairo, Egypt tomorrow.
[01:26:40.533 --> 01:26:44.275]  It's a global revolution against these tyrannical bankers.
[01:26:44.275 --> 01:26:46.456]  And by the way, you don't blow hot air.
[01:26:46.456 --> 01:26:47.976]  Another historical thing.
[01:26:47.976 --> 01:26:52.118]  I'm proud that you launched Operation Crush JPMorgan here on this show.
[01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:53.650]  I don't know.
[01:27:08.404 --> 01:27:11.506]  Well, I don't want to give you and I all the credit, or even the listeners.
[01:27:11.506 --> 01:27:17.951]  We could see the writing on the wall and basically pointed it out, but I do want to give you the credit for the idea, Max.
[01:27:17.951 --> 01:27:18.571]  It's amazing.
[01:27:18.571 --> 01:27:20.713]  But, you know, this whole... He did the Google bomb!
[01:27:20.713 --> 01:27:24.015]  He did the Google bomb, and that's what made this thing work, okay?
[01:27:24.015 --> 01:27:28.038]  The idea of buying silver academically, that made sense on paper.
[01:27:28.038 --> 01:27:32.681]  But you apply the InfoWars Google bomb, and it had a devastating effect.
[01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:34.903]  I noticed that Google is changing all their algorithms.
[01:27:34.903 --> 01:27:35.443]  Are they trying to...
[01:27:35.503 --> 01:27:37.464]  Is that part of the Infowars?
[01:27:37.464 --> 01:27:37.564]  Yes.
[01:27:37.564 --> 01:27:38.765]  No, they're trying to block us.
[01:27:38.765 --> 01:27:45.989]  They've said it's for alternative media websites and aggregators, though we have a lot of original news as well.
[01:27:45.989 --> 01:27:52.773]  They don't like our analysis and Google's blocked us out of Google News, but our listeners are spreading the word faster and faster.
[01:27:52.773 --> 01:28:02.738]  Because the people power is bigger than the authoritarian regimes, whether it's Google or the political powers in North Africa or Scott Walker in Wisconsin.
[01:28:02.738 --> 01:28:03.839]  Everyone's on the march.
[01:28:04.272 --> 01:28:08.073]  As Victor Hugo said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:28:22.077 --> 01:28:37.113]  Normally love beating up protesters all over the country, but then now they're there because they know they might get their money cut I see this as kind of government people finding out they've been robbed by the banksters and now kind of waking up But if I did see the cops
[01:28:37.734 --> 01:28:44.775]  You know, not attack an anti-war demonstration or not attack a group like that, then maybe I'd feel better.
[01:28:44.775 --> 01:28:47.056]  But, you know, look, we're running out of money.
[01:28:47.056 --> 01:28:47.716]  We're bankrupt.
[01:28:47.716 --> 01:28:51.536]  But I do agree with the fact, because the numbers are there, you could cut all the union money.
[01:28:51.536 --> 01:28:52.817]  You could cut all the government.
[01:28:52.817 --> 01:28:59.858]  It wouldn't pay a paltry amount of the overall trillions and trillions owed via fraud to these bankers.
[01:28:59.858 --> 01:29:00.758]  Wait a minute.
[01:29:00.758 --> 01:29:01.938]  What are you talking about?
[01:29:01.938 --> 01:29:04.039]  Wall Street just paid itself $144 billion in bonuses.
[01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:05.519]  What do you mean we're running out of money?
[01:29:06.648 --> 01:29:09.210]  You mean the bank stole all the money?
[01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:18.036]  Well, that's exactly... I'm saying you go after the bankers, you don't have the red herring of all these Republicans saying, we'll fix it, we'll cut the union's money.
[01:29:18.036 --> 01:29:22.979]  I'm saying that's like a micron of the overall spending, as you know, Max.
[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:24.381]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:24.381 --> 01:29:25.622]  That left-right thing is nonsense.
[01:29:25.622 --> 01:29:33.770]  The people who are demonstrating in Madison need to join hands with the rest of the revolutionaries around the world and understand the true dynamic of their oppression.
[01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:38.395]  Liberals need to run Gadsden flags up, buy guns, join the true rebellion.
[01:29:38.395 --> 01:29:41.217]  They don't want us to all come together.
[01:29:41.217 --> 01:29:42.258]  Max, good hearing from you.
[01:29:42.258 --> 01:29:43.119]  We'll talk to you Thursday.
[01:29:43.119 --> 01:29:44.381]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:44.381 --> 01:29:45.161]  Adios.
[01:29:45.161 --> 01:29:45.522]  Adios.
[01:29:51.294 --> 01:29:54.281]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.281 --> 01:29:57.909]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.088 --> 01:30:06.349]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.349 --> 01:30:09.891]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.891 --> 01:30:12.513]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.513 --> 01:30:18.377]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.377 --> 01:30:24.621]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:30.984]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.984 --> 01:30:35.205]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.205 --> 01:30:39.487]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.487 --> 01:30:45.429]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.429 --> 01:30:48.991]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:50.952]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.952 --> 01:30:51.392]  It's here.

[01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:04.540]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:08.824]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:31:08.824 --> 01:31:13.528]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:31:13.528 --> 01:31:19.472]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:31:19.472 --> 01:31:22.735]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:31:22.735 --> 01:31:26.418]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:31:29.393 --> 01:31:36.397]  We're American and be proud.
[01:31:36.397 --> 01:31:39.138]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:31:55.211 --> 01:31:59.791]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:32:00.387 --> 01:32:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:05.850]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.850 --> 01:32:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:10.133]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.133 --> 01:32:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.036 --> 01:32:15.777]  It's true.
[01:32:15.777 --> 01:32:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.480]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.063 --> 01:32:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.965 --> 01:32:29.745]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:32.506]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.506 --> 01:32:36.188]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.188 --> 01:32:36.988]  Number 5.
[01:32:36.988 --> 01:32:41.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:46.192]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.192 --> 01:32:50.353]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:50.353 --> 01:32:52.154]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:32:52.154 --> 01:32:56.756]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:32:57.056 --> 01:32:57.096]  877-327-0365.
[01:33:08.942 --> 01:33:13.167]  Well, I won't back down.
[01:33:13.167 --> 01:33:17.392]  No, I won't back down.
[01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:23.680]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.182]  Gonna stand on my ground.
[01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:32.393]  You're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:32.393 --> 01:33:33.795]  This is pretty funny.
[01:33:33.795 --> 01:33:39.519]  I called the women on The View shriveled demonic harpies.
[01:33:39.519 --> 01:33:41.380]  I forget the exact definition of a harpy.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.182]  Will you pull that up for me?
[01:33:43.182 --> 01:33:46.604]  And I want to be truthful here.
[01:33:46.604 --> 01:33:48.786]  Most of the women were nice on the show.
[01:33:48.786 --> 01:33:54.290]  Barbara Walters was speechless, was very angry during the segment with me and after.
[01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:56.236]  And that's
[01:34:15.803 --> 01:34:20.766]  And there on the left you can see Barbara Walters, and there on the right you can see Whoopi Goldberg.
[01:34:20.766 --> 01:34:29.430]  And it was really nice to meet them in person, because I had a chance over the years to watch them on television.
[01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:39.035]  But if you want to see a photo of them that I took, just go to your NSA, CIA, spy center, google.com, and type in Skeksy.
[01:34:39.975 --> 01:34:46.257]  And you'll be able to see a candid photo when they didn't have their cloaking devices on.
[01:34:46.257 --> 01:34:49.939]  And I was actually able to take a photo, because David Icke was there with me.
[01:34:49.939 --> 01:34:53.960]  And I was actually able to take a photo of them shape-shifting.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:54.920]  I'm joking!
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.582]  Before the news goes with this and says I really think that they're Skeksis.
[01:35:00.582 --> 01:35:02.763]  Those are the creatures from the Dark Crystal.
[01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.784]  That's basically how they were behaving.
[01:35:04.784 --> 01:35:05.904]  When the segment ended, they were going...
[01:35:12.367 --> 01:35:20.772]  So, more like a cross between David Rockefeller, Salacious Crumb, and the head Skeksis.
[01:35:20.772 --> 01:35:23.353]  In fact, let's go to YouTube now that I've gotten off of this.
[01:35:23.353 --> 01:35:24.013]  We're going to get serious.
[01:35:24.013 --> 01:35:24.954]  Go to Lindsey Williams.
[01:35:24.954 --> 01:35:27.655]  Pull up a YouTube clip of Skeksis.
[01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:36.100]  Let's play a short clip of Skeksis for people who are watching this on PrisonPlanet.tv so people will know exactly, exactly what I'm
[01:35:37.233 --> 01:35:43.876]  What I'm talking about, because the only way to describe... And I'm being mean to Whoopi Goldberg, too.
[01:35:43.876 --> 01:35:47.037]  In fact, I'm... You know what, this is all gallows humor.
[01:35:47.037 --> 01:35:49.578]  I'm actually a little bit depressed over the whole Charlie Sheen thing.
[01:35:49.578 --> 01:35:52.459]  I did not intend for that to happen when he was on air with me.
[01:35:52.459 --> 01:35:53.960]  He's happy and standing up to it.
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.960]  He thinks he's been wronged.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.541]  I think he has at many levels.
[01:35:56.541 --> 01:36:02.323]  But he's a good friend of mine, and I just hope all of this ends well on that front.
[01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:03.744]  Did we find a YouTube clip of...
[01:36:05.498 --> 01:36:09.441]  Just type the Dark Crystal into YouTube and you'll get it instantly.
[01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:12.263]  Because this is key information here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:12.263 --> 01:36:16.847]  Alright, now I'm digressing into silliness and I apologize.
[01:36:16.847 --> 01:36:18.328]  You know, here's the news.
[01:36:18.328 --> 01:36:22.111]  Oil climbs despite Saudi output pledge.
[01:36:23.578 --> 01:36:32.220]  World oil prices advanced on Tuesday despite OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia pledged to ensure sufficient supplies to cover Libya's production shortfall.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:39.682]  Brent North Sea crude for April delivery rose 67 cents to $112.47 a barrel.
[01:36:39.682 --> 01:36:48.064]  Gold and silver has also exploded in prices and again all of this is driven by overall dollar devaluation.
[01:36:48.064 --> 01:36:48.724]  Do you remember
[01:36:49.344 --> 01:36:55.836]  In mid-October, Lindsey Williams, who was the chaplain for Atlantic Richfield and in on other big meetings as chaplain czar,
[01:36:57.247 --> 01:36:58.808]  Very important position.
[01:36:58.808 --> 01:37:04.212]  Ken Fromm was the head of operations for Atlantic Richfield and for years he fed information.
[01:37:04.212 --> 01:37:08.594]  Lindsey Mr. Fromm died last December so we can now reveal his name and talk about it.
[01:37:08.594 --> 01:37:19.061]  He has another oil company exec who was actually the CEO of a company, I'll just leave it at that, who is alive and told him in October, watch in the next six months to a year oil prices at least 150.
[01:37:19.061 --> 01:37:20.022]  Watch the Middle East explode.
[01:37:21.863 --> 01:37:21.963]  The
[01:37:38.263 --> 01:37:45.186]  And the larger geopolitical ramifications of the double-crossing of the Arabs and North Africans.
[01:37:45.186 --> 01:37:50.407]  The Treasury deal signed with them back in the 1970s with Henry Kissinger.
[01:37:50.407 --> 01:37:52.988]  And I also have a major magazine reporter here.
[01:37:52.988 --> 01:37:54.109]  Should I mention who's here?
[01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.789]  Magazine reporter?
[01:37:57.921 --> 01:38:13.794]  Well, we got New York magazines here, and he was asking me during the break, because we've covered this all in such detail over and over again that I tend to just do a gestalt, or gestalt, where we'll just kind of boil down what's happening.
[01:38:13.794 --> 01:38:19.739]  He was saying, well, explain to me why the West would want to trigger the implosion of these countries.
[01:38:19.739 --> 01:38:21.780]  It doesn't mean the rebellions aren't real.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:25.944]  It doesn't mean people don't have a real beef or a reason to be upset and angry.
[01:38:27.685 --> 01:38:39.534]  What it does signify is that the political climate was already there, mainly over food and energy prices going up, with people living, you know, at subsistence levels.
[01:38:39.534 --> 01:38:44.938]  And so they send in ElBaradee the week before it's all triggered, five weeks ago, to start the ball rolling in Egypt.
[01:38:44.938 --> 01:38:52.303]  They've got their special operatives there, run out of the State Department, even the Washington Post reports that, in Libya.
[01:38:52.303 --> 01:38:55.786]  They're in there trying to gauge and control what's happening in Saudi Arabia.
[01:38:56.386 --> 01:39:00.709]  Saudi Arabia has now sent tanks to riot-hit Bahrain.
[01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:04.572]  It's being reported by RAA Novostat.
[01:39:04.572 --> 01:39:13.017]  Saudi Arabia sent dozens of tanks to Bahrain, where anti-government protests continued for about two weeks, Egypt's al-Masri al-Yom newspaper said today.
[01:39:13.017 --> 01:39:23.945]  Eyewitnesses reported seeing 15 tank carriers carrying two tanks each heading towards Bahrain along the 25-kilometer King Fahd Causeway, which links the small island nation of Bahrain to Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:24.705]  I think?
[01:39:45.302 --> 01:40:01.811]  What the double cross of the Arabs means, what dollar devaluation means, what you've been told, the reopening up of government-controlled oil production all over the United States, including obviously up in Alaska, that key sector, and how that's going to affect us.
[01:40:01.811 --> 01:40:10.155]  And let's go back to the stories about Ken Fromm you've never told before, and some of the things you can reveal from history that let us chart the future.
[01:40:11.741 --> 01:40:17.906]  For the first time, Alex, I honestly wish I could say I was wrong.
[01:40:17.906 --> 01:40:21.488]  Instead, I'm going to have to say this morning, I told you so.
[01:40:21.488 --> 01:40:37.641]  I don't know how to even express the way I feel this morning with Saudi Arabia moving tanks and troops right now, as this program is on the air, moving tanks and troops into Bahrain.
[01:40:37.641 --> 01:40:39.342]  Bahrain is where their oil goes out.
[01:40:40.171 --> 01:40:47.395]  And then, through the strength of our moves, Saudi Arabia is the number one supplier of crude oil for the United States of America.
[01:40:47.395 --> 01:41:02.462]  It has already been stated by Wall Street that if there's any problem whatsoever in just one more Mideast country, that the price of crude oil is going to go to $225.
[01:41:02.462 --> 01:41:06.885]  Now this was stated by a major Wall Street broker.
[01:41:06.885 --> 01:41:08.906]  Overnight, where I live,
[01:41:09.877 --> 01:41:13.120]  Gas, at the gas pump, gasoline went up 12 cents.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.681]  That's last night.
[01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:20.726]  Right now, the first day of March, it went up 12 cents a gallon at the gas pump.
[01:41:20.726 --> 01:41:29.293]  Saudi Arabia's stock market, this morning, is reported dropped 6.8% overnight.
[01:41:29.293 --> 01:41:31.995]  We're in trouble.
[01:41:31.995 --> 01:41:34.297]  I have begged people to listen to me.
[01:41:34.297 --> 01:41:35.098]  Now, for months,
[01:41:35.942 --> 01:41:41.885]  As you know, five months ago I stated on your program there's going to be a crisis in the Middle East.
[01:41:41.885 --> 01:41:45.227]  I did not realize how far the elite were going to take it.
[01:41:45.227 --> 01:41:51.011]  I knew that the dollar was going to be dead by the end of 2012.
[01:41:51.011 --> 01:41:56.874]  I knew because they had already told me that the price of crude oil was going from $175 to $200 a barrel within 9 to 12 months.
[01:41:56.874 --> 01:41:59.836]  I'm beginning to believe that they have accelerated
[01:42:05.159 --> 01:42:19.171]  Well that was four and a half months ago and you said to be technical 150 to 200 and so it's right on time for the acceleration they said that we would see in six months and you're on record telling us that.
[01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:22.692]  That's right, it was on your program.
[01:42:22.692 --> 01:42:24.633]  I tried my best to warn people.
[01:42:39.485 --> 01:42:45.247]  Charles, I have to say one other thing that's more startling than any of this.
[01:42:45.247 --> 01:42:48.928]  This is going to drastically affect the economy of the United States of America.
[01:42:48.928 --> 01:42:55.750]  The price of your groceries, everything that you do is going to be drastically affected as a result of this.
[01:42:55.750 --> 01:43:00.651]  But there's one thing that to me is more startling than any of this.
[01:43:00.651 --> 01:43:01.932]  We just got it the other day.
[01:43:01.932 --> 01:43:05.232]  I don't think I gave it on your program before.
[01:43:05.232 --> 01:43:06.813]  We were able to secure
[01:43:07.859 --> 01:43:09.882]  A video and sound bite.
[01:43:09.882 --> 01:43:16.609]  And Alex, I'm sorry, but I cannot apologize this morning for what we've just produced.
[01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:27.402]  I'll have to tell you, we were just able to secure a sound video bite of chanting during the time of the Egyptian revolution.
[01:43:28.477 --> 01:43:30.398]  And you will see it.
[01:43:30.398 --> 01:43:37.500]  It is in the language of Egypt, but yet the words in English we're putting over the top.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.041]  Are you talking about the stuff on YouTube where they're chanting death to Israel?
[01:43:41.041 --> 01:43:44.342]  You asked a question back over a week ago when I was on your program.
[01:43:44.342 --> 01:43:47.103]  You said Lindsey Howes is going to affect Israel.
[01:43:47.103 --> 01:43:48.443]  Well, I have your answer for you.
[01:43:49.170 --> 01:43:50.130]  They were chanting.
[01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:52.631]  Now this is a Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:43:52.631 --> 01:43:56.052]  At the time of the Egyptian riots.
[01:43:56.052 --> 01:43:58.212]  And the Muslim Brotherhood was chanting.
[01:43:58.212 --> 01:43:59.212]  Here we go.
[01:43:59.212 --> 01:44:02.093]  Folks, please, you need to write this down.
[01:44:02.093 --> 01:44:04.293]  Put it beside your calendar.
[01:44:04.293 --> 01:44:05.334]  Here's what they chanted.
[01:44:05.334 --> 01:44:09.775]  Quote, to Jerusalem we are headed.
[01:44:09.775 --> 01:44:12.055]  Martyrs in the millions.
[01:44:12.055 --> 01:44:13.035]  You haven't seen this.
[01:44:13.035 --> 01:44:16.136]  Alex, have you seen the footage on this?
[01:44:17.398 --> 01:44:22.202]  I've seen footage where they're chanting, we're gonna get Israel, death to Israel, we're gonna take back Jerusalem.
[01:44:22.202 --> 01:44:24.644]  I think that, I saw that on YouTube about a week ago.
[01:44:24.644 --> 01:44:25.505]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:44:26.095 --> 01:44:26.796]  No, no, no.
[01:44:26.796 --> 01:44:27.977]  This is another one.
[01:44:27.977 --> 01:44:35.203]  This is one that I really don't know where our producers got it, but this is amazing.
[01:44:35.203 --> 01:44:35.883]  You see it.
[01:44:35.883 --> 01:44:36.684]  You can't doubt it.
[01:44:36.684 --> 01:44:38.966]  You can hear it in the Egyptian language.
[01:44:38.966 --> 01:44:46.212]  Well, let's expand on that because from your research and what the oil company exec told you, they are triggering this.
[01:44:46.212 --> 01:44:48.394]  Why do they want to trigger this unrest?
[01:44:48.394 --> 01:44:49.775]  Is it order out of chaos?
[01:44:49.775 --> 01:44:51.497]  For the newspaper magazine reporter
[01:44:51.977 --> 01:44:53.458]  When Mr. Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State,
[01:45:04.395 --> 01:45:07.737]  This was after, of course, the oil fields had been produced by the Arabs.
[01:45:07.737 --> 01:45:26.645]  You remember that American oil companies, the majors, that had been formed at the time of the spindle top, 1901, Beaumont, Texas, first time major oil found in America, and of course the whole world was needing crude oil at that time to fuel everything.
[01:45:26.645 --> 01:45:33.628]  Texaco, Shell, Standard Oil, Chevron, they all were found in the Arab world over 60 years ago.
[01:45:34.188 --> 01:45:35.649]  These majors went in.
[01:45:35.649 --> 01:45:38.551]  The Arabs didn't have the money to produce their own oil fields.
[01:45:38.551 --> 01:45:40.233]  They couldn't do it.
[01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:44.436]  They had been prior to that nothing but nomads roaming the desert, spotting camels.
[01:45:44.436 --> 01:45:48.058]  And all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, this oil is found.
[01:45:48.058 --> 01:45:54.043]  These majors, Texaco Shell, Standard Oil, and Chevron, said, we will produce your oil field.
[01:45:54.043 --> 01:45:56.865]  We will build them for you.
[01:45:56.865 --> 01:46:00.488]  And you press back as you sell the oil.
[01:46:00.488 --> 01:46:01.268]  Then, when
[01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:08.153]  Mr. Henry Kissinger, our Secretary of State, this is where the double-cross began.
[01:46:08.153 --> 01:46:15.137]  He went abroad to every one of these Middle East oil companies' countries that were now producing oil.
[01:46:15.137 --> 01:46:21.261]  They had paid the Americans back for what they had built in their oil fields, and he said, I'd like to cut you a deal.
[01:46:22.839 --> 01:46:26.021]  He said, we will not produce from our own soil.
[01:46:26.021 --> 01:46:27.502]  This is so significant.
[01:46:27.502 --> 01:46:30.424]  We will not produce from our own soil.
[01:46:30.424 --> 01:46:31.425]  We know it's here.
[01:46:31.425 --> 01:46:34.046]  But he said, we will not produce from our own soil.
[01:46:34.046 --> 01:46:36.808]  We will buy oil from you.
[01:46:36.808 --> 01:46:42.591]  And the thing that we ask is that you take a certain percentage, and they never told me the percentage.
[01:46:42.591 --> 01:46:44.152]  They just told me they did it.
[01:46:44.152 --> 01:46:48.935]  That you take a certain percentage of what we buy oil from you with.
[01:46:49.656 --> 01:46:53.645]  And turn around and buy our Federal Reserve.
[01:46:53.645 --> 01:46:59.758]  Oh, please, folks, I'm pleading with you to hear this and to analyze what is being said.
[01:47:00.879 --> 01:47:16.824]  By our Federal Reserve T-Bills and issues at this point, it is obvious that they knew that America was coming to the financial crisis that it is today because somebody had to buy the interest on the debt.
[01:47:16.824 --> 01:47:19.285]  Never mind the $14 trillion debt.
[01:47:19.285 --> 01:47:21.246]  That is not even important.
[01:47:21.246 --> 01:47:22.987]  That's insignificant.
[01:47:22.987 --> 01:47:25.748]  The interest on the debt must be paid.
[01:47:25.748 --> 01:47:27.788]  How is that interest on the debt paid?
[01:47:27.788 --> 01:47:29.589]  It is paid by
[01:47:30.329 --> 01:47:41.340]  All producing countries, by China, by Japan, by super rich people buying T-bills, which were considered to be the most secure currency on the face of the earth.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:45.083]  It was the reserve currency of the world, so to speak, the American dollar.
[01:47:47.019 --> 01:47:54.301]  Kissinger said, you buy our treasury issues, our T-bills, we will buy your yes.
[01:47:54.301 --> 01:48:00.843]  And they have bought the majority of the interest on the American debt over these years.
[01:48:00.843 --> 01:48:07.084]  Now, they intentionally, by design, the Muslim Brotherhood is being supported by the elite.
[01:48:07.084 --> 01:48:10.445]  I'll guarantee you, I have ways of knowing this.
[01:48:11.025 --> 01:48:13.728]  And they are going to start in Egypt.
[01:48:13.728 --> 01:48:17.012]  I told you, I pleaded with you to listen to me.
[01:48:17.012 --> 01:48:18.994]  And I'm doing the same today.
[01:48:18.994 --> 01:48:26.363]  Five months before it happened, I came on Alex Jones Show and I said within four to five months there's going to be a crisis in the Middle East.
[01:48:26.363 --> 01:48:28.625]  I've been told it by my elite friends.
[01:48:28.625 --> 01:48:30.087]  It happened within four months.
[01:48:30.667 --> 01:48:32.769]  Almost to the day exactly as we said it.
[01:48:32.769 --> 01:48:33.450]  Why?
[01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:39.676]  They intentionally are creating the crisis that started in Egypt, it went to Libya, it's now going to Saudi Arabia.
[01:48:39.676 --> 01:48:43.159]  Saudi Arabia is the greatest supplier of American crude oil.
[01:48:43.159 --> 01:48:47.003]  When that oil is cut off, you haven't seen anything.
[01:48:47.003 --> 01:48:50.847]  You think gasoline 12 cents overnight at the gas pump went up.
[01:48:51.267 --> 01:48:57.072]  So the globalists are triggering the implosion of the old order to now announce their new IMF World Bank run Bancor Global SDR QE3
[01:49:14.927 --> 01:49:18.450]  They intentionally have double-crossed the Middle East oil-producing countries
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:47.961]  Yeah, let's get into any new information you haven't covered, but I promise to get you back on to go back to those Ken Fromm stories you could never tell until now.
[01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:12.470]  March the 11th.
[01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:14.271]  Please put it down on your calendar.
[01:50:14.271 --> 01:50:15.551]  March the 11th.
[01:50:15.551 --> 01:50:20.753]  The Muslim Brotherhood has declared a day of rage in Saudi Arabia.
[01:50:20.753 --> 01:50:27.674]  Folks, if they succeed, that's the reason right now in Saudi Arabia, they're moving into Bahrain.
[01:50:27.674 --> 01:50:30.235]  Tanks, troops, everything imaginable.
[01:50:30.735 --> 01:50:33.737]  If that shuts down, we will have $200 to $225.
[01:50:33.737 --> 01:50:37.900]  It'll go above everything they told me it was going to happen.
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.262]  It'll be $200 to $225 a barrel at the gas pump.
[01:50:41.262 --> 01:50:45.985]  It will so reflect our American economy and the dollar.
[01:50:45.985 --> 01:50:55.051]  The dollar today, please, you've got to see this, the dollar today was $76.73 just a few moments ago, before I went on the show.
[01:50:55.051 --> 01:50:58.574]  It has been predicted by analysts... Lindsey, stay there.
[01:50:58.574 --> 01:50:59.414]  Let's continue.
[01:50:59.414 --> 01:50:59.995]  Let's continue.
[01:51:01.236 --> 01:51:02.537]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.537 --> 01:51:08.124]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.124 --> 01:51:13.150]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:18.717]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.717 --> 01:51:20.539]  So, our friends at Solutions from Science,
[01:51:20.819 --> 01:51:21.299]  We're good to go!
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:53.062]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:53.062 --> 01:51:57.884]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.884 --> 01:52:00.845]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:00.845 --> 01:52:03.766]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 1-2-3.
[01:52:03.766 --> 01:52:06.367]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high,
[01:52:06.587 --> 01:52:09.889]  Now you can build your own solar panels for less than $200.
[01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:10.649]  Don't laugh!
[01:52:10.649 --> 01:52:13.591]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[01:52:30.479 --> 01:52:31.720]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.283]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:52:36.283 --> 01:52:42.087]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:52:42.087 --> 01:52:45.729]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:52:45.729 --> 01:52:48.451]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:52:48.451 --> 01:52:53.514]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:53:00.319 --> 01:53:01.199]  My name is Crystal.
[01:53:01.199 --> 01:53:02.300]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:04.801]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:53:04.801 --> 01:53:06.942]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:53:22.409 --> 01:53:23.250]  What did Crystal do?
[01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:27.215]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:53:27.215 --> 01:53:33.622]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:53:33.622 --> 01:53:37.186]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:54:02.085 --> 01:54:04.847]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:54:04.847 --> 01:54:13.994]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:13.994 --> 01:54:14.995]  Okay, Lindsey, I wanna...
[01:54:16.508 --> 01:54:18.790]  This is the method of the New World Order.
[01:54:43.763 --> 01:54:47.825]  To bring in everything that they want to do by the end of 2012.
[01:54:47.825 --> 01:54:50.887]  I gave you that timeline over two years ago.
[01:54:50.887 --> 01:54:55.929]  I told you that I've been told by Mr. Trump, that's before he passed away, that the timeline is the end of 2012.
[01:54:55.929 --> 01:54:59.471]  Uh, we're getting very close.
[01:54:59.471 --> 01:55:02.613]  Here's what basically you're going to see next.
[01:55:02.613 --> 01:55:05.894]  When Kissinger went abroad and said, I'll cut you a deal.
[01:55:05.894 --> 01:55:08.135]  You buy our treasury issues.
[01:55:08.135 --> 01:55:10.036]  It was as sound as the dollar.
[01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:11.117]  It's not that way today.
[01:55:11.886 --> 01:55:15.707]  This Middle East crisis is all perpetrated by the elite.
[01:55:15.707 --> 01:55:19.888]  I was told that, and I reported it on your show before it ever happened.
[01:55:19.888 --> 01:55:23.850]  You can't say you didn't hear it, and I'm warning you what's going to happen from here.
[01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:28.851]  Whenever this crisis grows to a fever pitch, it is going to Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:28.851 --> 01:55:35.553]  One way or the other, the Muslim Brotherhood will see to it, and March the 11th is their goal for the Day of Rage.
[01:55:35.553 --> 01:55:40.715]  And when this happens, Saudi being the one to supply more crude oil to America than any other country,
[01:55:41.295 --> 01:55:46.938]  It will impact the American economy and society, and the dollar.
[01:55:46.938 --> 01:55:51.241]  The dollar, just before going on your show this morning, Alex, I looked at it.
[01:55:51.241 --> 01:55:58.505]  It was 76.73, and it is forecast that when it hits 75, it will plunge.
[01:55:58.505 --> 01:56:07.670]  That means that you go to the grocery store, you're going to be paying phenomenal prices for groceries, for hardware, for everything imaginable that's going to happen in the Middle East.
[01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:14.973]  As this price grows to a fever pitch, in turn, they will not be able to supply us with the oil.
[01:56:14.973 --> 01:56:19.115]  Bolivia just cut off 1.6 million barrels that went to Europe.
[01:56:19.115 --> 01:56:26.317]  Now, when Saudi Arabia cuts off the United States of America, can you even comprehend, in the least, what is going to happen?
[01:56:26.317 --> 01:56:27.838]  This is not the worst part.
[01:56:27.838 --> 01:56:37.102]  The part that is so significant is, when the dollar plunges, the value of those T-bills and Federal Reserve securities, China holds $1 trillion worth.
[01:56:38.122 --> 01:56:43.389]  All of the Middle East countries were told by Mr. Kissinger it was the soundest currency in the world.
[01:56:43.389 --> 01:56:46.573]  They have trillions of dollars worth.
[01:56:46.573 --> 01:56:51.479]  Whenever this plunges, the American dollar goes down because they can't supply.
[01:56:51.479 --> 01:56:53.602]  The American economy is affected.
[01:56:54.282 --> 01:56:57.563]  This is an outright double-cross.
[01:56:57.563 --> 01:57:01.604]  Folks, do you have the slightest idea what they intentionally did?
[01:57:01.604 --> 01:57:17.089]  They double-crossed all these nations, sold them worthless paper, now they're holding it, and then when they realize what this country has done to them, when China realizes they have $1 trillion of worthless paper, folks, I warned you, I pleaded with you,
[01:57:17.549 --> 01:57:24.432]  Mr. Plum told me before he passed away, he said, Chaplain, if it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[01:57:24.432 --> 01:57:43.301]  And when America, they've done this intentionally in the Middle East in order to create the crisis so that they could bring about the Americans being in such a destitute condition that you will plead and beg with the New World Order, the World Bank, and the IMF for a new currency.
[01:57:43.301 --> 01:57:46.203]  You will plead and beg with them to supply you oil.
[01:57:46.843 --> 01:57:49.485]  You will do anything at any price.
[01:57:49.485 --> 01:58:05.115]  At that point, I have been told, and I just said this days ago, I appeared on your show for the first time last week, Alex, with this, I was told that at that point, we will open up four major oil fields in America, produced from our own soil, but you will be paying
[01:58:06.136 --> 01:58:27.275]  Over $200 a barrel for it, but it could be produced for $60 a barrel, but at that point, you would be so destitute in America, you would beg for anything in order to be able to drive to work, and your dollar would be so worthless, and the nations of the world are so angry at us, the New World Order will be able to bring in all of that which they already have planned.
[01:58:27.315 --> 01:58:31.256]  And then they will pose as our gracious saviors.
[01:58:31.256 --> 01:58:36.818]  And if you go back and read your book from 30 years ago, it was all laid out right there, and now here it is unfolding.
[01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:42.619]  The question is, can the globals complete this operation?
[01:58:42.619 --> 01:58:46.040]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:54.059 --> 01:59:56.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:59.221]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.782 --> 02:00:07.083]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.083 --> 02:00:08.863]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.863 --> 02:00:10.624]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.624 --> 02:00:12.205]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.205 --> 02:00:13.746]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.746 --> 02:00:17.948]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.948 --> 02:00:23.990]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:33.215]  Well, while the world is focused on the Charlie Sheen extravaganza that was launched on this show by accident last Thursday,
[02:00:35.356 --> 02:00:37.729]  That's the number one story in the world right now, all over the planet.
[02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:46.617]  According to Yahoo, Google, and many other barometers, we're seeing world government launch their takeover operation of the planet.
[02:00:46.617 --> 02:00:57.405]  How bizarre that we're in the middle of both major stories tracking the serious situation with Pastor Lindsey Williams and also at the center of the Charlie Sheen situation.
[02:00:57.405 --> 02:01:01.568]  It's, well, reality is much stranger than fiction.
[02:01:01.568 --> 02:01:08.153]  That certainly is borne out by people who are living in reality and taking action in their daily lives.
[02:01:08.153 --> 02:01:08.854]  You can certainly
[02:01:10.834 --> 02:01:14.217]  Just see how strange this world truly is.
[02:01:14.217 --> 02:01:22.824]  Lindsey, for those that haven't done the deep research on all this, I hope they realize that you're not just saying you made these predictions in October.
[02:01:22.824 --> 02:01:30.291]  You weren't just saying three and a half years ago that oil would go from $50 a barrel to $150 in the next few months, and it did.
[02:01:30.291 --> 02:01:33.994]  Then you said now it's going to plunge down to $40, and then it did.
[02:01:33.994 --> 02:01:38.118]  And then you said you've got two years, it's slowly going to go up, and then it's going to explode.
[02:01:39.232 --> 02:01:41.713]  I mean, you're not predicting.
[02:01:41.713 --> 02:01:46.355]  You have these major globalist sources known to myself and Dr. Stan Monteith and others.
[02:01:46.355 --> 02:01:54.878]  Obviously, we can talk about Ken Fromm now because he sadly died of cancer, but we can't get into the other gentleman, the former oil company CEO.
[02:01:54.878 --> 02:01:57.039]  But this is a short segment.
[02:01:57.039 --> 02:01:58.800]  I wanted to go back in time.
[02:02:00.135 --> 02:02:03.898]  Because in the last two interviews, we haven't gotten to the Ken Fromm situation.
[02:02:03.898 --> 02:02:05.279]  He was always hiding in plain view.
[02:02:05.279 --> 02:02:08.481]  You gave a speech with him when he first went public.
[02:02:08.481 --> 02:02:12.324]  He was then fired when your book came out, later rehired.
[02:02:12.324 --> 02:02:19.389]  You told the story of the oil company CEO showing up at the back of the audience when he was speaking, when you were there.
[02:02:19.389 --> 02:02:27.395]  I mean, this all came out in the early 80s, and this whole 50-year plan we've been on by the globalists.
[02:02:27.395 --> 02:02:29.217]  Briefly, break down that Ken Fromm story.
[02:02:30.856 --> 02:02:38.381]  Well, uh, Alex, you know, I'll be glad to, but there's so many things here right now that I'd love to say, but, okay.
[02:02:38.381 --> 02:02:41.904]  Uh, back in those days it was quite obvious.
[02:02:41.904 --> 02:02:48.368]  He had told me when the Gar Island Prime came in that this is what's so significant to right now.
[02:02:48.368 --> 02:02:54.873]  And folks, I just, I'm pleading with you, I'm begging with you this morning, that you listen to these things.
[02:02:54.873 --> 02:02:59.256]  You have never been affected in your lifetime like you're going to be affected in the next few weeks' time.
[02:03:00.151 --> 02:03:07.398]  The Gar Island find is recorded in my book, Finishing Non-Crisis, if Gar Island doesn't blow your mind, it will.
[02:03:07.398 --> 02:03:20.051]  And the day that I washed the largest oil pool on the face of the earth, proven and brought in, and within 24 hours, the information was already classified, and I asked Mr. Fromm, I said, Ken, why don't you bring this to the American people?
[02:03:20.051 --> 02:03:22.133]  Why don't you give us our Great American Dream?
[02:03:22.133 --> 02:03:23.935]  Why don't you let us have soil from our own?
[02:03:24.475 --> 02:03:25.155]  I don't know.
[02:03:42.502 --> 02:03:51.149]  And Ken said to me, he said, we will not produce this oil from our own soil until we have crude oil to $150 to $200 a barrel.
[02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:56.232]  It looks as though it's going to be $225 a barrel instead of $200 a barrel.
[02:03:56.232 --> 02:03:58.514]  They're going to open up four major oil fields.
[02:03:58.514 --> 02:04:01.416]  I was told this 35 years ago.
[02:04:01.416 --> 02:04:04.538]  It was in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, what Mr. Fromm said.
[02:04:04.538 --> 02:04:06.560]  It's reported now.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.122]  I'm telling you, online is in trouble.
[02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:16.938]  Saudi Arabia is scheduled for a day of rage on March the 11th by the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:04:16.938 --> 02:04:19.621]  They're moving tanks into Bahrain this morning.
[02:04:32.194 --> 02:04:36.058]  And we've talked about the Day of Rage coming up.
[02:04:36.058 --> 02:04:38.840]  Have you talked to your other Mr. X?
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.121]  That's an important question.
[02:04:40.121 --> 02:04:42.443]  Have you talked to him since we talked last Monday?
[02:04:42.443 --> 02:04:49.450]  So I'm going to ask you that when we come back after the break and a lot more with Chaplain Lindsey Williams.
[02:04:49.450 --> 02:04:52.552]  Please stay with us, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:52.552 --> 02:04:53.113]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:02.327 --> 02:05:06.351]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.351 --> 02:05:09.595]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.595 --> 02:05:14.400]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:20.807]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.807 --> 02:05:23.030]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:23.870]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:24.390]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:25.051]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:26.331]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.331 --> 02:05:28.572]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.458 --> 02:05:49.741]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:49.741 --> 02:05:58.865]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:06:01.269 --> 02:06:04.853]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.853 --> 02:06:05.974]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:05.974 --> 02:06:10.539]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.539 --> 02:06:16.485]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.485 --> 02:06:18.647]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.647 --> 02:06:21.310]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:21.670 --> 02:06:28.155]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:06:28.155 --> 02:06:30.376]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:06:30.376 --> 02:06:35.720]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:41.004]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:06:41.004 --> 02:06:46.168]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:06:46.348 --> 02:06:49.550]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:52.551]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:52.551 --> 02:06:53.331]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:06:53.331 --> 02:06:53.912]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:06:53.912 --> 02:06:57.453]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:57.453 --> 02:06:59.054]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:16.664]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.664 --> 02:07:19.706]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:19.706 --> 02:07:22.027]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:22.027 --> 02:07:28.271]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.271 --> 02:07:31.654]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.654 --> 02:07:37.437]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:37.437 --> 02:07:39.079]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:39.079 --> 02:07:40.219]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:43.041]  Watch this free video online today.
[02:07:43.041 --> 02:07:47.264]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:47.264 --> 02:07:51.887]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:07:51.887 --> 02:07:54.469]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:08:02.155 --> 02:08:07.659]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.302 --> 02:08:15.384]  As you know, I was on The View yesterday.
[02:08:15.384 --> 02:08:22.488]  Barbara Walters almost had a stroke while I was on, and I started joking around about how she looked like a Skeksy.
[02:08:22.488 --> 02:08:23.208]  And that's mean.
[02:08:23.208 --> 02:08:24.489]  I don't mean because she looked old.
[02:08:24.489 --> 02:08:27.891]  I mean the way she behaved, the mannerisms.
[02:08:27.891 --> 02:08:35.315]  For people who don't know what a Skeksy is, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, I'm going to play a clip of having dinner last night with the
[02:08:36.736 --> 02:08:40.139]  With Barbara Walters and some of the other people from The View.
[02:08:40.139 --> 02:08:40.879]  This is a joke.
[02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:42.380]  I didn't really have dinner with them.
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:45.383]  And then we'll go back to Lindsey Williams.
[02:08:45.383 --> 02:08:47.264]  And we are having some gallows humor here.
[02:08:47.264 --> 02:08:50.146]  This is pretty heavy, painful stuff we're talking about.
[02:08:50.146 --> 02:08:53.969]  By being aware of the globalist plan we can hopefully turn it around and stop it.
[02:08:53.969 --> 02:08:57.972]  But this is basically what Barbara Walters acted like after the segment was over.
[02:08:57.972 --> 02:08:59.593]  She was very upset.
[02:08:59.593 --> 02:09:02.115]  And here is a clip of my meeting with Barbara Walters.
[02:09:08.659 --> 02:09:12.800]  You slime face!
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:13.900]  There's Barbara.
[02:09:43.321 --> 02:09:48.486]  There was the producer of the show.
[02:09:48.486 --> 02:09:50.488]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:09:50.488 --> 02:09:52.170]  Maybe more we'll have later.
[02:09:52.170 --> 02:09:53.551]  That's behind the scenes at The View.
[02:09:53.551 --> 02:09:56.434]  Look, I'm being really mean and I apologize, folks.
[02:09:56.434 --> 02:09:57.655]  But I gotta have some fun with this.
[02:09:59.008 --> 02:09:59.729]  They invited me on.
[02:09:59.729 --> 02:10:00.930]  Actually, I appreciate them having me on.
[02:10:00.930 --> 02:10:05.054]  I actually like Bahar.
[02:10:05.054 --> 02:10:06.135]  I was on her show on CNN.
[02:10:06.135 --> 02:10:09.418]  She was nice, but the others certainly did not like me.
[02:10:09.418 --> 02:10:12.662]  Okay, going back to Lindsey Williams.
[02:10:12.662 --> 02:10:14.724]  Lindsey, this is pretty hardcore stuff.
[02:10:14.724 --> 02:10:19.048]  You were trying to... Well, during the break, I asked you the $64 million question.
[02:10:19.048 --> 02:10:21.250]  It's been about a week and a half since you talked to your
[02:10:22.111 --> 02:10:25.094]  Living Mr. X, even more high-powered than Ken Fromm.
[02:10:25.094 --> 02:10:27.296]  And I asked you during the break, I said, have you talked to him again?
[02:10:27.296 --> 02:10:31.180]  And you said, yes, but I'm not allowed to tell you what he told me.
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:33.262]  Well, I mean, why do they even give you this information then?
[02:10:33.262 --> 02:10:34.143]  I mean, I know it's real.
[02:10:34.143 --> 02:10:35.784]  I know the information's real.
[02:10:35.784 --> 02:10:39.168]  But, but, I mean, could you give us any idea what it was on?
[02:10:40.606 --> 02:11:01.518]  Alex, over 35 years since I was on the Trans-Alaska pipeline and had the privilege of literally being invited to be the chaplain of the world for three years' time, of the chaplain of the elite of the world for three years' time, there has never been a single time that they ever told me anything that it didn't happen exactly as they said it.
[02:11:01.518 --> 02:11:06.661]  Okay, but why is he telling you stuff now that you can't reveal?
[02:11:06.661 --> 02:11:07.462]  For mom's sake.
[02:11:08.671 --> 02:11:13.755]  Keep in mind, these people never knew what it was to come in contact with a chaplain before.
[02:11:13.755 --> 02:11:16.616]  Many of these people never met a minister of the gospel.
[02:11:16.616 --> 02:11:18.137]  I was on the oil field.
[02:11:18.137 --> 02:11:20.018]  They were not in my church.
[02:11:20.018 --> 02:11:26.022]  And many times, they have said to me, chaplain, to protect yourself, you better do this and this and this.
[02:11:26.022 --> 02:11:27.903]  And this is exactly that.
[02:11:27.903 --> 02:11:34.407]  A week ago, or about a week and a half ago, your producer called me on the phone and said, is anything new?
[02:11:34.407 --> 02:11:36.569]  And I said, you better bet there, believe there is.
[02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:40.950]  And I was willing to say what's going to happen in the Middle East.
[02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:43.310]  You see it unfold before your eyes.
[02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:46.091]  Now, I know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[02:11:46.091 --> 02:11:51.732]  And I think the reason they say it is because of their own conscience, if there is such a thing in the elite of the world.
[02:11:51.732 --> 02:12:00.033]  Remember, one of the facets of their code of ethics is that they must tell the world everything they're going to do before they do it.
[02:12:00.033 --> 02:12:02.874]  There will be a point at which I can tell some of these things because
[02:12:03.314 --> 02:12:05.896]  No, I know, but you're saying he told you something new, but you're not allowed to tell us.
[02:12:05.896 --> 02:12:06.997]  You can't give us a hint?
[02:12:17.048 --> 02:12:18.028]  I'm telling you right now.
[02:12:18.028 --> 02:12:19.689]  I'm begging of you.
[02:12:19.689 --> 02:12:22.009]  The standard currency of the world is crude oil.
[02:12:22.009 --> 02:12:24.090]  Watch where you remember.
[02:12:24.090 --> 02:12:27.211]  I was given here back about two years ago.
[02:12:27.211 --> 02:12:33.293]  He said, watch the price of crude oil and you will know the progression of the program of the elite.
[02:12:33.293 --> 02:12:35.153]  What did it happen overnight?
[02:12:35.153 --> 02:12:40.655]  You went up 12 cents per gallon at the gas pump here in my area overnight last night.
[02:12:42.276 --> 02:12:46.799]  And what you're seeing happen with crude oil tells you where the timeline is.
[02:12:46.799 --> 02:12:54.365]  Do you realize that their timeline was the end of 2012 and it appears almost that they are accelerating that timeline?
[02:12:54.365 --> 02:13:00.949]  Can't you read between the lines folks out there in the audience and realize what this man is telling me?
[02:13:00.949 --> 02:13:04.872]  But if he told you so much, why can't you specifically tell us what he told you?
[02:13:05.933 --> 02:13:31.569]  The name of the game is control, and after they basically have gained control of everything worldwide, not just in America, but worldwide, whenever they have, at that point, they begin to bring all of the world under the New World Order out of its mess, and over a period of, I don't know how many years, they've never told me, but over a period of so many years, they will bring the world back to a position where they
[02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:34.252]  Okay, I want to specifically go back.
[02:13:34.252 --> 02:13:37.595]  You're saying that's what he told you that was new?
[02:13:49.898 --> 02:13:51.741]  No, I'm not saying that's what he told me.
[02:13:51.741 --> 02:13:54.324]  Well, why can't you tell us what he told you?
[02:13:54.324 --> 02:13:58.089]  So that you can see it for yourself, and I cannot give you certain things.
[02:13:58.089 --> 02:13:59.791]  I probably will in the future.
[02:13:59.791 --> 02:14:02.014]  Remember, I was threatened two years ago by my family.
[02:14:02.014 --> 02:14:03.396]  No, I know, Lindsey, we appreciate you.
[02:14:03.396 --> 02:14:04.938]  By my whole family.
[02:14:04.938 --> 02:14:07.382]  I know what happened to John F. Kennedy.
[02:14:07.682 --> 02:14:09.765]  He was the President of the United States of America.
[02:14:09.765 --> 02:14:12.107]  I'm just a little peon sitting down here beside myself.
[02:14:12.107 --> 02:14:14.730]  Okay, so he tells you some stuff you can talk about.
[02:14:14.730 --> 02:14:18.915]  ...my life for the sake of something that I'm trying to tell you between the lines right now.
[02:14:18.915 --> 02:14:23.441]  You've got to read what the elite are saying by listening to their buzzwords.
[02:14:23.661 --> 02:14:26.602]  All right, now I want to shift gears here into a similar area.
[02:14:26.602 --> 02:14:28.902]  Oil prices rise on Mideast.
[02:14:28.902 --> 02:14:30.002]  Bernanke comments.
[02:14:30.002 --> 02:14:33.023]  He says it's going to have little effect on our economy.
[02:14:33.023 --> 02:14:34.603]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[02:14:34.603 --> 02:14:38.204]  I was just talking to this reporter who's done the Kissinger profile.
[02:14:38.204 --> 02:14:40.705]  He just did the Karl Rove profile for New York Mag.
[02:14:40.705 --> 02:14:47.006]  He said Karl Rove told him, and it's in the new piece, that, in fact, what's the name of your piece?
[02:14:47.006 --> 02:14:48.746]  I haven't read it yet.
[02:14:48.746 --> 02:14:49.267]  He's out there.
[02:14:49.267 --> 02:14:50.947]  What's the name of your new piece, Joe?
[02:15:00.117 --> 02:15:01.717]  God dang it, baby, we're making good time.
[02:15:01.717 --> 02:15:06.158]  That's the name of the new Karl Rove profile piece in Newark Magazine.
[02:15:06.158 --> 02:15:09.519]  And Karl Rove told him there is no Republican establishment.
[02:15:09.519 --> 02:15:16.400]  So now even saying that there's a Republican establishment, like the RNC, says that's a conspiracy theory and it doesn't exist.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:23.181]  Now we have Bernanke telling us that we left the recession in June of 2009, a year and a half ago, or more.
[02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:26.762]  And now we have him telling us that oil prices going up doesn't affect the economy.
[02:15:26.762 --> 02:15:28.662]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are, Lindsey?
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:34.301]  They take us to be totally stupid.
[02:15:34.301 --> 02:15:40.022]  In fact, I told you two years ago that the elite were laughing at the average American.
[02:15:40.022 --> 02:15:48.765]  I don't know how to say any more except the fact that there's more of us than there are of them, and the faster you can wake people up, Alex, the quicker we're going to see something happen.
[02:15:49.225 --> 02:15:55.450]  Now, I'm quite sure you realize that on Friday night of last week, you were very busy over the weekend.
[02:15:55.450 --> 02:16:00.394]  On Friday night of last week, Coast to Coast AM had me on schedule for two hours.
[02:16:00.394 --> 02:16:05.978]  At the end of two hours, the audience was so alive, so excited, so exuberant.
[02:16:05.978 --> 02:16:09.221]  I mean, they said they had not seen such as this before.
[02:16:09.221 --> 02:16:11.603]  They asked me to stay on for a third hour.
[02:16:11.603 --> 02:16:15.426]  Three hours on Coast to Coast AM with 60-something million listeners.
[02:16:15.846 --> 02:16:18.087]  I hope I help to wake up America.
[02:16:18.087 --> 02:16:20.208]  You just finished with Barbara Walters.
[02:16:20.208 --> 02:16:21.989]  You're trying to wake up America.
[02:16:21.989 --> 02:16:23.530]  I'm on your show this morning.
[02:16:23.530 --> 02:16:27.692]  I'm pleading with you to read what the elite said to me.
[02:16:27.692 --> 02:16:31.174]  And I'm trying to say it every place I can say it.
[02:16:31.174 --> 02:16:35.257]  You must listen to what is happening at the gas pump.
[02:16:35.257 --> 02:16:36.297]  No, I understand.
[02:16:36.297 --> 02:16:37.318]  This is earth-shaking.
[02:16:38.298 --> 02:16:42.122]  This is earth-shaking, Lindsey, but so what are the solutions?
[02:16:42.122 --> 02:16:48.769]  Warn people about the globalist agenda so hopefully as they implode the economy we don't take their solution for more tyranny?
[02:16:49.636 --> 02:16:52.178]  They're going to open up four major oil fields.
[02:16:52.178 --> 02:16:58.281]  In any one of these oil fields, they can produce oil at $16 per barrel.
[02:16:58.281 --> 02:17:00.383]  Folks, I am saying it to you.
[02:17:00.383 --> 02:17:02.204]  You've got to hear it.
[02:17:02.204 --> 02:17:06.406]  They are going to charge you $200 a barrel for it.
[02:17:06.406 --> 02:17:09.508]  They can produce it for $16 a barrel.
[02:17:09.508 --> 02:17:12.010]  It could be 60 cents a gallon of a gas pump.
[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:12.991]  We're good to go.
[02:17:28.448 --> 02:17:31.690]  InfoWars, Alex Jones Show today.
[02:17:31.690 --> 02:17:33.432]  This movement could start.
[02:17:33.432 --> 02:17:36.894]  I do not want a movement of rebellion.
[02:17:36.894 --> 02:17:42.358]  I do not want a... I don't want people doing what they're doing over in Libya.
[02:17:42.358 --> 02:17:43.639]  That is wrong.
[02:17:43.639 --> 02:17:49.483]  But we've got to turn this thing back around again and give us back the great American dream.
[02:17:49.483 --> 02:17:50.823]  Stop the elite.
[02:17:50.823 --> 02:17:53.025]  Somehow you folks must listen to me.
[02:17:53.025 --> 02:17:54.326]  And Alex, I've got to.
[02:17:54.326 --> 02:17:55.647]  Please, bear with me here.
[02:17:56.147 --> 02:17:58.928]  Do you want to know everything that's going to happen at the gas pump?
[02:17:58.928 --> 02:18:01.369]  Do you want to know everything that's going to happen at the grocery store?
[02:18:01.369 --> 02:18:03.350]  Do you want to know where the dollar is going?
[02:18:03.350 --> 02:18:09.013]  We started out on Saturday filming a new production entitled, The Middle East, the rest of the story.
[02:18:09.013 --> 02:18:11.774]  I thought we were going to have one DVD.
[02:18:11.774 --> 02:18:13.895]  We went to two DVDs.
[02:18:13.895 --> 02:18:17.617]  The camera crew was seeing that literally mesmerized.
[02:18:17.617 --> 02:18:23.799]  The man who was operating the camera, a young man, he said, chaplain, I've never heard anything like this before.
[02:18:23.799 --> 02:18:24.620]  We went three,
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:26.260]  Hours!
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.901]  We are having a three-hour presentation.
[02:18:28.901 --> 02:18:36.503]  All of you last week who called in to our toll-free service, you're not getting two DVDs as you thought you were.
[02:18:36.503 --> 02:18:38.584]  You're going to get for the same price three.
[02:18:38.584 --> 02:18:40.364]  You have never heard things like this.
[02:18:40.364 --> 02:18:44.385]  The things that were given to me over the weekend, I have put them into this.
[02:18:44.385 --> 02:18:46.826]  It'll be the first time it's ever heard before.
[02:18:46.826 --> 02:18:48.086]  You'll see them chatting.
[02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:49.907]  To Jerusalem we're headed.
[02:18:49.907 --> 02:18:51.767]  Martyrs in the millions.
[02:18:51.767 --> 02:18:53.508]  All I can say is, Alex,
[02:18:54.228 --> 02:19:01.233]  This message has got to get out, and the whole nation has got to make a turnaround.
[02:19:01.233 --> 02:19:07.357]  And is the DVD set called, with all this... Sure, is this DVD set with all the latest information?
[02:19:07.357 --> 02:19:11.600]  It's called The Middle East, The Rest of the Story, ProphecyClub.com.
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:20.846]  When I called you a week and a half ago, you weren't even really planning to do this, and I'm glad that you are codifying all the new information you've been given with the old information in one place.
[02:19:20.846 --> 02:19:21.987]  ProphecyClub.com.
[02:19:21.987 --> 02:19:22.848]  Lindsey, real fast,
[02:19:23.208 --> 02:19:25.229]  Fire out the toll free number for folks that want to get it.
[02:19:25.229 --> 02:19:25.850]  888-799-6111.
[02:19:25.850 --> 02:19:28.151]  We increased our operators to 688-799-6111.
[02:19:28.151 --> 02:19:33.814]  But Alex, I hope you'll allow me to give updates as we're seeing these things
[02:19:43.019 --> 02:19:44.060]  Absolutely, Lindsey.
[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:49.083]  We're out of time, but I want to get you back up again next week as we approach March 11th.
[02:19:49.083 --> 02:19:50.924]  And let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:19:50.924 --> 02:19:53.025]  I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:19:53.025 --> 02:19:54.585]  We got Webster Tarpley coming up.
[02:19:54.585 --> 02:19:58.848]  I got a bunch of financial news and the latest on TSA molestation.
[02:19:58.848 --> 02:20:00.129]  Key information straight ahead.
[02:20:01.414 --> 02:20:02.715]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.715 --> 02:20:08.299]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:13.322]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.322 --> 02:20:18.886]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:18.886 --> 02:20:20.727]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:20:20.987 --> 02:20:21.487]  We're good to go!
[02:20:50.386 --> 02:20:53.248]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.248 --> 02:20:58.072]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[02:21:01.198 --> 02:21:05.282]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?

[02:21:52.125 --> 02:21:53.547]  America, you've been warned.
[02:22:10.094 --> 02:22:10.514]  We're good to go.
[02:22:42.642 --> 02:22:43.002]  We're good.
[02:23:00.976 --> 02:23:03.958]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.

[02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:30.292]  Well, Ted Anderson flew out to New York to support me and I appreciate it.
[02:24:30.292 --> 02:24:33.935]  I got to spend some time with him on a Sunday and Monday.
[02:24:33.935 --> 02:24:40.201]  And we got to have lunch with Judge Andrew Napolitano right across the street from Fox Studios at a steakhouse.
[02:24:40.201 --> 02:24:41.582]  Had a great talk with the judge.
[02:24:42.162 --> 02:24:52.405]  He's super hardcore, a lot more than Glenn Beck, and the fact that his show's getting top ratings and now being re-aired on the regular Fox Channel shows that he's the big up-and-comer.
[02:24:52.405 --> 02:24:58.247]  Very positive news on that front to see the True Liberty movement really starting to take over Fox News.
[02:24:59.284 --> 02:25:02.548]  Ted, gold, silver, way up again today.
[02:25:02.548 --> 02:25:03.950]  I know you just got back from New York.
[02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:05.852]  I got back in the early morning hours last night.
[02:25:05.852 --> 02:25:12.239]  We're going to be talking to Webster Tarpley about what's happening in the economy and in the Middle East, North Africa coming up.
[02:25:12.239 --> 02:25:16.444]  But in the short segment we've got, we told people it's dollar devaluation.
[02:25:17.245 --> 02:25:20.007]  And I know you had a gold and silver special last week.
[02:25:20.007 --> 02:25:23.610]  I haven't asked you, I haven't talked to you yet today because you just got back from the airport.
[02:25:23.610 --> 02:25:35.678]  If you could still offer the deals on gold and silver you bought over a month ago and pass on savings and deals on certain silver and gold coins that nobody else can even get close to matching.
[02:25:35.678 --> 02:25:37.440]  Have you run out?
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:38.441]  Has the price gone up?
[02:25:38.441 --> 02:25:38.881]  What's the deal?
[02:25:39.241 --> 02:25:41.402]  Here's the crazy part about it, Alex.
[02:25:41.402 --> 02:25:46.304]  Because I was tied up in New York with the Sheen deal out there with you, I didn't have a chance to change prices.
[02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:47.084]  I just landed.
[02:25:47.084 --> 02:25:51.726]  I got in at 1 o'clock and here I am sitting here at 1.30 talking to you.
[02:25:51.726 --> 02:25:53.787]  Prices are the same because of that.
[02:25:53.787 --> 02:25:56.168]  As of a week ago, silver shot up.
[02:25:56.168 --> 02:25:57.009]  I mean, come on.
[02:25:57.009 --> 02:25:57.549]  Silver is at
[02:25:58.410 --> 02:26:00.613]  $34.55 today.
[02:26:00.613 --> 02:26:03.137]  Gold $14.25.
[02:26:03.137 --> 02:26:06.242]  The Libyan oil thing is just driving that up.
[02:26:06.242 --> 02:26:09.587]  Bernanke's saying that we're going to have short-lived inflation and moderate.
[02:26:09.587 --> 02:26:11.951]  I think he should be the one who's getting the drug test right now.
[02:26:13.857 --> 02:26:15.038]  Here we sit.
[02:26:15.038 --> 02:26:17.080]  Maybe he's got tiger blood, huh?
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:22.644]  Well, I mean, Alex, I'm offering three videos right now and three silver dollars for $97.
[02:26:22.644 --> 02:26:23.685]  Silver is over $34.55.
[02:26:23.685 --> 02:26:25.687]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:26:25.687 --> 02:26:35.615]  You've got, what, a hundred-year-old, it's even semi-numismatic silver coins, $97, free shipping and three of my films.
[02:26:35.615 --> 02:26:37.536]  That's a $70 discount.
[02:26:37.536 --> 02:26:39.037]  I mean, no one can beat that deal.
[02:26:39.037 --> 02:26:43.241]  I mean, you can't find silver dollars by themselves for the price you just mentioned, Ted.
[02:26:43.621 --> 02:26:45.222]  No, you can't find silver dollars.
[02:26:45.222 --> 02:26:48.904]  As a matter of fact, I'm changing prices tonight because I can't find them either.
[02:26:48.904 --> 02:26:51.545]  In addition to this, I've got the Franks still at $3.08.
[02:26:51.545 --> 02:26:52.606]  They've shot up.
[02:26:52.606 --> 02:26:54.647]  British Sovereigns, $3.86.
[02:26:54.647 --> 02:26:55.988]  All that stuff is up.
[02:26:55.988 --> 02:26:57.029]  The U.S.
[02:26:57.029 --> 02:26:59.430]  Eagles, just about everything you name.
[02:26:59.430 --> 02:27:01.171]  The only reason why the prices are low, Alex,
[02:27:01.451 --> 02:27:03.212]  I haven't had time to adjust things.
[02:27:03.212 --> 02:27:04.652]  I will be adjusting them tomorrow.
[02:27:04.652 --> 02:27:06.333]  I can't help it.
[02:27:06.333 --> 02:27:08.233]  The market's just going nuts.
[02:27:08.233 --> 02:27:19.277]  And, you know, talking about oil prices, I mean, a gallon of oil, a gallon of gasoline here is well over $3.50 a gallon in the state of Minnesota.
[02:27:19.277 --> 02:27:21.697]  I mean, it's going out of this world.
[02:27:21.697 --> 02:27:29.620]  Well, I'll tell you what, Charlie, you know, the whole Charlie Sheen thing overshadowing all this world market news, it's crazy.
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:31.681]  It sure is, man.
[02:27:31.681 --> 02:27:33.582]  It's absolutely absurd.
[02:27:33.582 --> 02:27:39.826]  I mean, we're looking at possibly another third world war that's developing in North Africa right now.
[02:27:39.826 --> 02:27:48.091]  I mean, everybody, the Chinese, the United States, all of Europe, we're all coming together on this thing.
[02:27:48.091 --> 02:27:58.598]  That Libyan thing is serious, serious business, driving the price of oil up, the stock market is down today, the dollar's in the tank, gold is going up, silver shot up over
[02:27:59.498 --> 02:28:01.699]  $34.55 an ounce.
[02:28:01.699 --> 02:28:05.421]  That means that we could be seeing $35 silver here very shortly.
[02:28:05.421 --> 02:28:08.762]  And in addition to this, $40 silver is just within reach.
[02:28:08.762 --> 02:28:11.003]  It's not even unreasonable to think that.
[02:28:11.003 --> 02:28:15.465]  And already Silver Eagles and that type of thing are already up there touching that number.
[02:28:15.465 --> 02:28:16.826]  So, you know, here we are.
[02:28:16.826 --> 02:28:18.927]  I just can't say it enough.
[02:28:18.927 --> 02:28:24.349]  Right now, if you haven't had a chance to take advantage of that offer, we take credit cards.
[02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:27.551]  Just, you know, pick up three videos of Alex Jones.
[02:28:27.551 --> 02:28:27.711]  I mean,
[02:28:28.311 --> 02:28:35.593]  For goodness sakes, if you're concerned at all about liberty and the freedom movement, pick up these videos, get the original copy.
[02:28:35.593 --> 02:28:36.513]  Yeah, they're free, folks.
[02:28:36.513 --> 02:28:37.594]  It's a great deal on silver.
[02:28:37.594 --> 02:28:38.494]  800-686-2237.
[02:28:38.494 --> 02:28:44.195]  So the brokers will stay there until tonight at midnight, and then the prices are going up tomorrow.
[02:28:44.195 --> 02:28:50.177]  It'll still be a great deal, but those incredibly off-the-chart good deals, tell them it's the Alex Jones Special.
[02:28:50.177 --> 02:28:56.659]  There's a big, long list of different coins and things where you'll get the older price of when Ted bought the silver and gold a month ago.
[02:28:57.839 --> 02:29:02.622]  I mean, have you already run out of that and are selling new stuff you bought at a loss, is what you're saying, Dad?
[02:29:02.622 --> 02:29:05.124]  You know, that's basically what I'm saying, Alex.
[02:29:05.124 --> 02:29:07.245]  I have no more inventory at that older price.
[02:29:07.245 --> 02:29:09.487]  I mean, people went crazy and bought this stuff.
[02:29:09.487 --> 02:29:13.109]  I know there's a little bit of delay because you're printing more videos for me.
[02:29:13.109 --> 02:29:17.712]  They'll be here within about a week and a half, and we'll get them right out to you as quickly as we can.
[02:29:17.712 --> 02:29:23.616]  But if you want to take advantage of something, I mean, you and I both know people need to have precious metals in their portfolio.
[02:29:23.616 --> 02:29:25.998]  It makes way more sense than having this fee
[02:29:26.018 --> 02:29:27.359]  Yeah, and I got good news for you, Ted.
[02:29:27.359 --> 02:29:30.582]  We're shipping those videos today, so there is no wait.
[02:29:30.582 --> 02:29:30.642]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:30.642 --> 02:29:35.386]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:35.386 --> 02:29:36.467]  Take advantage of those deals.
[02:29:36.467 --> 02:29:42.112]  Three silver dollars, ninety-seven dollars, free shipping, three of my best films on top of it.
[02:29:42.112 --> 02:29:44.874]  You can't get three silver dollars for ninety-seven dollars, folks.
[02:29:44.874 --> 02:29:46.316]  There are over a hundred everywhere.
[02:29:46.316 --> 02:29:46.856]  So do the math.
[02:29:46.856 --> 02:29:46.916]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:46.916 --> 02:29:47.317]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.482 --> 02:29:55.410]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.410 --> 02:29:58.075]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:05.483]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:05.483 --> 02:30:11.888]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:11.888 --> 02:30:19.274]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:19.274 --> 02:30:24.138]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:30:24.138 --> 02:30:26.280]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:30:30.563 --> 02:30:32.824]  People keep asking me, how's business?
[02:30:32.824 --> 02:30:35.125]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:30:35.125 --> 02:30:35.466]  Call us.
[02:31:01.859 --> 02:31:16.305]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.341 --> 02:31:22.023]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:22.023 --> 02:31:34.788]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.788 --> 02:31:42.071]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:31:42.751 --> 02:31:53.123]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:31:53.123 --> 02:31:57.047]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:57.047 --> 02:32:00.170]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:32:00.771 --> 02:32:05.312]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:05.312 --> 02:32:06.232]  Number 1.
[02:32:06.232 --> 02:32:09.653]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:10.513]  Number 2.
[02:32:10.513 --> 02:32:15.415]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:15.415 --> 02:32:16.155]  It's true.
[02:32:16.155 --> 02:32:21.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:21.016 --> 02:32:21.856]  Number 3.
[02:32:21.856 --> 02:32:25.437]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.437 --> 02:32:29.138]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.338 --> 02:32:30.138]  Number 4.
[02:32:30.138 --> 02:32:32.900]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:36.582]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:36.582 --> 02:32:37.362]  Number 5.
[02:32:37.362 --> 02:32:41.524]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.524 --> 02:32:46.567]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.567 --> 02:32:50.749]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:50.749 --> 02:32:52.530]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:57.132]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:57.812 --> 02:33:06.257]  877-327-0365.
[02:33:06.257 --> 02:33:12.300]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:14.842]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:37.824]  Webster Griffin Tarpley is a historian, author, journalist, lecturer, and critic of U.S.
[02:33:37.824 --> 02:33:39.005]  foreign and domestic policy.
[02:33:39.005 --> 02:33:45.330]  Tarpley maintains the September 11th attacks were engineered by a rogue network of the military-industrial complex and intelligence agencies.
[02:33:45.330 --> 02:33:53.457]  His writings and speeches describe a model of false-flag terror operations by a rogue network in the military-industrial sector working with moles in the private sector and in corporate media.
[02:33:54.363 --> 02:33:58.628]  He also maintains the notion of anthropogenic global warming as a fraud.
[02:33:58.628 --> 02:34:07.418]  Webster Tarpley is the author of several books, including George Herbert Walker Bush, The Unauthorized Biography, The Obama Postmodern Coup, Making of a Manchurian Candidate.
[02:34:07.418 --> 02:34:10.141]  By the way, all those books are available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:10.141 --> 02:34:13.825]  And you may know all about this, but your friends, your family, your neighbors don't.
[02:34:13.825 --> 02:34:14.906]  They're ready to be awakened.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:25.387]  And he is a regular guest on this show as his own Saturday morning afternoon show here on Genesis and does commentary on international television routinely.
[02:34:25.387 --> 02:34:28.069]  Again, he has a doctorate in history and is also an economist.
[02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:38.577]  Webster, you called the Middle East destabilization program just like Max Keiser and so many others did via dollar devaluation.
[02:34:38.577 --> 02:34:46.880]  I have New York Magazine here, big high-powered writer, who's done the Karl Rove profile this week.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.581]  He did the Kissinger profile.
[02:34:48.581 --> 02:34:50.362]  He's here doing a profile on yours truly.
[02:34:51.202 --> 02:34:56.346]  And you can put it so eloquently and succinctly before we get into all the other news.
[02:34:56.346 --> 02:35:06.934]  Boil down for him who is behind the destabilization in the Middle East, why they want it, what is the geopolitical trigger zone, the order out of chaos system.
[02:35:06.934 --> 02:35:11.477]  Give him the evidence of that because he was asking me and I said wait till Tarbly comes on.
[02:35:11.477 --> 02:35:14.820]  I can break it down but Tarbly can do it say in a five minute succinct
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:41.082]  Package then we'll get into what's happening with commodities Bernanke saying this won't affect us right now with the oil prices Exploding Bernie Madoff saying the whole government is a Ponzi scheme that Goldman Sachs is yeah, no kidding We'll get your view on that, but but I mean you know you're here talking to New York Daily News Not New York Daily News a New York magazine and and in a nutshell break it down for him the overall stratagem
[02:35:41.877 --> 02:35:45.042]  Thank you Alex, thank you for the chance to do this.
[02:35:45.042 --> 02:35:53.234]  We're dealing with a large-scale imperialist rampage by the United States and the British.
[02:35:53.234 --> 02:35:55.257]  This is imperialism.
[02:35:55.257 --> 02:35:57.260]  This is a kind of neo-imperialism.
[02:35:57.978 --> 02:36:07.243]  Which involves overthrowing all the puppet governments that exist, largely because these puppet governments are not dependent enough.
[02:36:07.243 --> 02:36:08.924]  They're too autonomous.
[02:36:08.924 --> 02:36:12.086]  They don't follow orders in the way that the U.S.
[02:36:12.086 --> 02:36:13.027]  and the British want.
[02:36:13.647 --> 02:36:24.076]  So, it started back in November, December, in particular, with the CIA limited hangout self-exposure operation known as WikiLeaks.
[02:36:24.076 --> 02:36:30.481]  And we still have that going on with all kinds of sympathy gags designed to portray Julian Assange as a martyr.
[02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:38.267]  But, essentially, this was an operation ordered up by people like Cass Sunstein, who's sitting inside the Obama White House.
[02:36:38.267 --> 02:36:39.448]  Cognitive infiltration.
[02:36:39.448 --> 02:36:41.870]  Cognitive infiltration, and even worse.
[02:36:42.490 --> 02:36:50.212]  So, that then knocked over the relatively mild dictatorship or authoritarian regime, really, in Tunisia.
[02:36:50.212 --> 02:36:57.674]  And now we've got this process rolling through a series of Arab, Middle East, North African countries.
[02:36:57.674 --> 02:37:07.496]  The common denominator of this is that it aims at either creating new puppet governments that will be much weaker and much more dependent on the U.S.
[02:37:07.496 --> 02:37:11.097]  and the British, or chaos, civil war, and
[02:37:12.157 --> 02:37:14.339]  And the division of countries by a secessionism.
[02:37:14.339 --> 02:37:33.010]  I think right now, based on what you're seeing on the news media, Al Jazeera in particular, Al Jazeera-Putschvision, which is the main channel of the destabilization and the coups, you can see that we're now getting close to the declaration of a no-fly zone over Libya.
[02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:36.692]  Similar to what these same imperialists, the U.S.
[02:37:36.692 --> 02:37:48.058]  and the British, did in Iraq at the end of the first Gulf War back in the early 90s, where they said, we're not going to allow Qaddafi to take off with any planes.
[02:37:48.058 --> 02:37:50.419]  I had tweeted about this in my Twitter feed.
[02:37:50.419 --> 02:37:55.382]  You can go back and look on February 24th from Hamburg, Germany, where I was at the time.
[02:37:56.082 --> 02:38:09.035]  I put out a thing saying watch out for a no-fly zone followed by a NATO invasion, a goal, among other things, to seize the oil fields and possibly divide Libya into two parts.
[02:38:09.035 --> 02:38:18.124]  The basis of this no-fly zone is the story that Qaddafi is using his military aviation, his air force,
[02:38:18.664 --> 02:38:26.835]  Against these cities in Cyrenaica, in this area of Benghazi-Tobruk, near the Egyptian border.
[02:38:26.835 --> 02:38:30.861]  He's been accused of using these planes to strafe demonstrations and so forth.
[02:38:30.861 --> 02:38:34.686]  Just now, on Russia Today, we have the Russian General Staff
[02:38:37.607 --> 02:38:47.371]  But why are they triggering this now?
[02:38:47.371 --> 02:38:55.014]  What is the larger ramification, not just for that geopolitical sector of the Near East, Middle East, and Central Asia?
[02:38:55.014 --> 02:38:57.955]  I mean, is that all part of the Russian encirclement operation?
[02:38:57.955 --> 02:39:00.576]  But expanding, what is the plan in the markets?
[02:39:01.596 --> 02:39:03.838]  Well, in terms of the Middle East itself, let's take Hosni Mubarak.
[02:39:03.838 --> 02:39:05.099]  He had been there for 30 years.
[02:39:05.099 --> 02:39:05.619]  He was entrenched.
[02:39:23.294 --> 02:39:25.376]  There was somebody who could say no to the U.S.
[02:39:25.376 --> 02:39:25.897]  and the British.
[02:39:25.897 --> 02:39:27.499]  And what did he say no on?
[02:39:27.499 --> 02:39:28.600]  He said no U.S.
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:34.386]  military bases in Egypt, no troops for the Iraq War, no troops for the Afghanistan War.
[02:39:34.386 --> 02:39:43.856]  And then in 2009, the new Obama administration came with their new imperialist plan, which is that you'd assemble a front of Sunni Arab states.
[02:39:44.634 --> 02:39:52.128]  Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Jordan, along with Israel in a direct alliance with U.S.
[02:39:52.128 --> 02:39:56.897]  military bases in all of these countries, including Egypt, where Mubarak never wanted them.
[02:39:57.632 --> 02:39:59.754]  And that would then be under the U.S.
[02:39:59.754 --> 02:40:15.487]  nuclear umbrella, and that would then be a group of kamikaze puppets, the Arabs in particular, that would be played against Iran, against Syria, against Hezbollah, against Hamas, in other words, the radicals, the rejection front in the Middle East.
[02:40:15.487 --> 02:40:17.089]  Mubarak said no.
[02:40:17.089 --> 02:40:18.170]  Mubarak had to go.
[02:40:19.191 --> 02:40:21.753]  In 2010, with the U.S.
[02:40:21.753 --> 02:40:32.600]  screaming hysterically that all conceivable commercial ties to Iran had to be broken, Mubarak opened up these direct flights from Cairo to Tehran and back.
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:37.804]  So this was somebody who had become much too uppity, much too rebellious.
[02:40:37.804 --> 02:40:39.345]  Another good case, Bahrain.
[02:40:39.345 --> 02:40:42.467]  We've got the destabilization of the emirate of Bahrain.
[02:40:43.067 --> 02:40:43.849]  Out there in the Gulf.
[02:40:43.849 --> 02:40:46.413]  What was their original sin?
[02:40:46.413 --> 02:40:48.637]  Well, it's that that's the base of the U.S.
[02:40:48.637 --> 02:40:49.379]  5th Fleet.
[02:40:49.379 --> 02:40:51.523]  The one in the Persian Gulf or Arabian Gulf.
[02:40:52.259 --> 02:41:04.926]  And the royal family there had put up a veto saying, we forbid the United States to use this space for the purpose of attacking Iran, and therefore they had to be destabilized.
[02:41:04.926 --> 02:41:17.132]  Qaddafi, of course, is somebody that they have attempted to remove repeatedly back in 1986 using this cover story of this silly LaBelle discotheque accusation against Libya with no proof.
[02:41:18.212 --> 02:41:24.434]  Reagan bombed Libya, tried to kill Gaddafi, and ended up killing Gaddafi's one-and-a-half-year-old daughter.
[02:41:24.434 --> 02:41:27.575]  So they killed the baby, but they couldn't get Gaddafi.
[02:41:27.575 --> 02:41:29.355]  Then, of course, we have the Shaler affair.
[02:41:29.355 --> 02:41:43.699]  David Shaler of MI5, British counterintelligence, says he was sitting in his office one day when he became aware that MI6, the CIA equivalent for the British, was attempting to assassinate Gaddafi with the help of
[02:41:44.399 --> 02:41:56.048]  Uh, well, Al-Qaeda, that they had hired an Al-Qaeda, um, allied organization, given them £100,000 of British taxpayer money and told them to try to kill Gaddafi.
[02:41:56.048 --> 02:41:57.349]  They did attempt to kill him.
[02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:58.270]  A bomb went off.
[02:41:58.270 --> 02:41:59.451]  It didn't kill Gaddafi.
[02:41:59.451 --> 02:41:59.811]  It killed
[02:42:00.591 --> 02:42:06.096]  But obviously we're not saying Gaddafi's a good guy.
[02:42:06.096 --> 02:42:09.179]  They know the political climate is there to allow overthrows.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:18.167]  The dominoes already set out by IMF, World Bank, dollar devaluation policy driving up basic living expenses like food and energy.
[02:42:18.167 --> 02:42:20.509]  But again, what is the larger strategy?
[02:42:20.509 --> 02:42:23.371]  So how are they planning on the dominoes falling around the rest of the world?
[02:42:28.246 --> 02:42:30.067]  Well, let me just finish the thing on Libya.
[02:42:30.067 --> 02:42:33.350]  The Shaler scenario in 1995 is what we're seeing now.
[02:42:33.350 --> 02:42:37.473]  If you eliminate Gaddafi, assassinate him, then you have chaos.
[02:42:37.473 --> 02:42:42.316]  You can say al-Qaeda did it, you can say al-Qaeda is there, and then you can invade.
[02:42:42.316 --> 02:42:44.718]  And I think the assets that the U.S.
[02:42:44.718 --> 02:42:51.963]  and the British would like to seize are in this Cyrenaica area, this Tobruk-Benghazi, near the Egyptian border.
[02:42:51.963 --> 02:42:53.104]  That seems to be where the oil
[02:42:53.724 --> 02:42:54.525]  We're good to go.
[02:43:14.626 --> 02:43:16.949]  Tunisia is descending into chaos.
[02:43:16.949 --> 02:43:24.977]  The wonderful singing tomorrows of democracy and the color revolution, the jasmine revolution, has turned now into chaos, and you've got boat people.
[02:43:24.977 --> 02:43:35.067]  And the boat people go to the other side of the Mediterranean, but even before they get there, you have the Italian island of Lampedusa, you have these other Italian islands, and then you have Sicily.
[02:43:35.547 --> 02:43:48.292]  So, all of the Mediterranean states, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, places like this... And now they want to, they're reportedly moving special forces into the eastern area to back the rebels.
[02:43:48.292 --> 02:43:54.394]  AFP, let's put that back on screen, I believe that was AFP, is reporting that the rebels have had a victory near Tripoli.
[02:43:54.394 --> 02:43:56.415]  Now, who knows if any of the... Yeah, you don't know any of that.
[02:43:56.415 --> 02:43:57.675]  Yeah, that's Associated Press.
[02:43:57.675 --> 02:43:58.436]  We have no idea.
[02:43:58.436 --> 02:44:04.258]  I mean, they already told us two weeks ago that Qaddafi, or a week and a half ago, had run to Venezuela.
[02:44:05.673 --> 02:44:07.013]  They're telling all these stories.
[02:44:07.013 --> 02:44:12.915]  I would take all of this with lots of grains of salt because, again, we've got the Kuwait incubator baby syndrome going.
[02:44:12.915 --> 02:44:19.077]  We've got these... We've got the syndrome claiming on 888 that the Russians attacked Georgia.
[02:44:19.077 --> 02:44:19.957]  Precisely.
[02:44:19.957 --> 02:44:24.298]  So here we have these accusations that Qaddafi's strafing his own people.
[02:44:24.298 --> 02:44:34.541]  Another thing that is going on is that black Africans are being lynched by the anti-Qaddafi forces, and this includes people from southern Libya who are also black.
[02:44:35.041 --> 02:44:39.983]  They're being lynched because they're being accused of being mercenaries for Gaddafi.
[02:44:39.983 --> 02:44:42.304]  I don't know if there's any proof of that, either.
[02:44:42.304 --> 02:44:49.707]  So there are a lot of stories about what Gaddafi is supposedly doing, and I think all of this is unreliable.
[02:44:49.707 --> 02:44:52.368]  A couple of other things coming out of this.
[02:44:52.368 --> 02:44:58.850]  You've got the destabilization of Europe, with maybe one to two million refugees right now, as far as I can see.
[02:44:58.850 --> 02:45:03.712]  Plus, of course, you're driving up the price of oil, and as the price of oil goes up, the
[02:45:04.132 --> 02:45:07.274]  So that's dollars the Fed doesn't have to monetize.
[02:45:07.274 --> 02:45:08.914]  What do you think about Lindsey Williams?
[02:45:08.914 --> 02:45:10.975]  I know he is in contact with a former Big Three oil CEO.
[02:45:25.983 --> 02:45:36.691]  And he's telling him that by the end of next year, they are planning to kill the dollar as the world reserve currency and move to this SDR, Bancorp-backed basket.
[02:45:36.691 --> 02:45:42.235]  So, I mean, I know Lindsey's being told these things, but I mean, how does this work for the dollar long term?
[02:45:42.795 --> 02:45:55.982]  I don't think this is realistic in the sense that you can, of course, remove the dollar as a reserve currency, but all of these other things they're talking about to replace it are absolutely impossible, unworkable, for all kinds of reasons.
[02:45:55.982 --> 02:45:58.363]  Let's just go back to the imperialist rambage, though.
[02:45:58.363 --> 02:46:02.345]  You look at Pakistan, and you look at the case of this Ray Davis.
[02:46:02.345 --> 02:46:06.387]  Now, this person, now being held by the Pakistani government,
[02:46:06.867 --> 02:46:09.530]  Apparently he's a CIA agent attached to the U.S.
[02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:11.452]  Embassy in Pakistan.
[02:46:11.452 --> 02:46:17.677]  This guy has all the earmarks, from afar anyway, of a terrorist controller.
[02:46:17.677 --> 02:46:19.920]  This is what the Pakistani press is saying.
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:24.364]  And not just any terrorist controller, but somebody who may have been setting up
[02:46:24.964 --> 02:46:40.237]  A radioactive nuclear materials dirty bomb inside Pakistan that would have furnished a pretext for the US to come on the scene arguing, aha, the Pakistani nuclear forces are not secure.
[02:46:40.237 --> 02:46:42.399]  There's been a leak here of radioactive material.
[02:46:43.169 --> 02:46:49.132]  Therefore, we, the U.S., have to seize the bombs, the entire Pakistani nuclear force.
[02:46:49.132 --> 02:46:55.415]  So you can see, you're in a phase of tremendous aggression, a flight forward by the imperialists.
[02:46:55.415 --> 02:47:04.940]  It's got to do, of course, with the world economic depression can be relied on, as it did in the 1930s, to drive the imperialist spunkers.
[02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:05.680]  They're going crazy.
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:05.820]  Sure.
[02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:12.284]  What's your intel on full-on NATO, U.N., U.S.-backed invasion of Libya?
[02:47:12.984 --> 02:47:17.349]  Yeah, that seems to be quite possible now.
[02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:18.671]  You look at the assets, right?
[02:47:18.671 --> 02:47:21.834]  You have the British base in Larnaca, Cyprus.
[02:47:21.834 --> 02:47:23.336]  You've got now this U.S.
[02:47:23.336 --> 02:47:31.426]  aircraft carrier, Enterprise, plus the helicopter landing ship, Kearsarge, moving in some cases through the Suez Canal and approaching
[02:47:32.247 --> 02:47:33.428]  Libya.
[02:47:33.428 --> 02:47:36.153]  You've got the British base in Gibraltar.
[02:47:36.153 --> 02:47:44.185]  One that's interesting is the NATO base at Sigonella, Sicily, as well as the NATO base in Aviano in the northeast.
[02:47:44.998 --> 02:47:51.840]  Italy, would Berlusconi, a friend of Gaddafi, allow NATO to use those bases?
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:58.302]  We've had cases in the past where Italian Prime Minister Croxi, back in the 1980s, would not allow the U.S.
[02:47:58.302 --> 02:48:00.602]  to do what they wanted with Sigonella.
[02:48:00.602 --> 02:48:05.684]  There's a famous case about a clash about who was going to arrest some terrorists from the Achille Lauro case.
[02:48:06.945 --> 02:48:09.487]  What you also got is an attack on an axis.
[02:48:09.487 --> 02:48:14.112]  It's Putin of Russia, Berlusconi of Italy, and Qaddafi.
[02:48:14.112 --> 02:48:17.215]  That is in some ways a combination.
[02:48:17.215 --> 02:48:31.148]  All kinds of development deals, all kinds of business arrangements, the South Stream Pipeline, which NATO hates, and between Berlusconi and Qaddafi you have quite a close relation in terms of business.
[02:48:32.089 --> 02:48:37.754]  Gaddafi, in the past, has been an investor in fiat, the company that now owns Chrysler.
[02:48:37.754 --> 02:48:39.316]  So, what the U.S.
[02:48:39.316 --> 02:48:44.481]  is doing is targeting these combinations or centers of resistance.
[02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:47.864]  It's like a new phase of imperialism.
[02:48:47.864 --> 02:48:51.688]  Well, that's the French mercantilism model of keep
[02:48:52.188 --> 02:49:05.724]  Keep your quasi-possessions destabilized and in proxy and fighting with each other so that you can come in and buy them up for pennies on the dollar and easily control them and pose as the savior.
[02:49:05.724 --> 02:49:08.307]  I'm not even talking about the French in today's standards.
[02:49:08.307 --> 02:49:10.450]  I'm saying the model of globalism.
[02:49:10.450 --> 02:49:12.212]  Is it not neo-mercantilism?
[02:49:12.612 --> 02:49:13.633]  No, I wouldn't call it that.
[02:49:13.633 --> 02:49:14.934]  It's British imperialism.
[02:49:14.934 --> 02:49:19.176]  It's free trade, globalized British imperialism, not mercantilism.
[02:49:43.333 --> 02:49:50.100]  Yeah, but the great historical example of this is the British Empire, which runs on... Yeah, the Great Game!
[02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:50.960]  The Great Game!
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:53.103]  ...an imperial preference.
[02:49:53.103 --> 02:49:59.849]  French mercantilism in the person of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, one of the inspirers of Alexander Hamilton.
[02:49:59.849 --> 02:50:04.134]  The French mercantilist system for France under people like, well, Louis XIV, Louis XV,
[02:50:05.735 --> 02:50:08.198]  This had definite positive features.
[02:50:08.198 --> 02:50:11.782]  It made France, on the whole, a more advanced industrial country than the British.
[02:50:11.782 --> 02:50:13.544]  But that's because they had an industrial policy.
[02:50:13.544 --> 02:50:17.208]  Still, the overall policy was to concentrate power and vertically integrate.
[02:50:17.208 --> 02:50:19.570]  Right, but I would call this, this is simply imperialism.
[02:50:19.570 --> 02:50:20.912]  This is British imperialism.
[02:50:21.432 --> 02:50:21.552]  Okay.
[02:50:39.981 --> 02:50:40.942]  Webster, stay there.
[02:50:40.942 --> 02:50:56.118]  I want to come back in the final segment and talk about Madoff saying the whole government's a Ponzi scheme, what you see happening with the deterioration of the global economy, what you see as hotspots, just a bunch of little points I want to hit on for the next countries to face this type of insurrection.
[02:50:56.118 --> 02:50:58.221]  Will the globalists go after Saudi Arabia?
[02:50:58.221 --> 02:50:59.242]  That's an important question.
[02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:03.873]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:51:03.873 --> 02:51:08.038]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[02:51:08.038 --> 02:51:14.767]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:51:14.767 --> 02:51:16.049]  You need a backup plan.
[02:51:16.049 --> 02:51:19.874]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.
[02:51:20.034 --> 02:51:32.897]  Go to CollapseProof.com to get your free special report and discover how to store your gold and silver in the world's safest vaults, or how to hold foreign currencies in a way that's safe from bank failures, bank runs, or exchange controls.
[02:51:32.897 --> 02:51:33.597]  Learn how the U.S.
[02:51:33.597 --> 02:51:40.198]  government failed to collect a $36 million claim because the defendant legally used an offshore asset protection program.
[02:51:40.198 --> 02:51:45.599]  This is what you need to keep your wealth safe when the dollar collapses, and CollapseProof.com can help.
[02:51:45.759 --> 02:51:46.099]  I don't know.
[02:52:10.503 --> 02:52:13.826]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[02:52:13.826 --> 02:52:17.509]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[02:52:17.509 --> 02:52:18.309]  Have you?
[02:52:18.309 --> 02:52:29.618]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[02:52:29.618 --> 02:52:30.799]  Could this really happen?
[02:52:30.799 --> 02:52:34.783]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[02:52:34.783 --> 02:52:40.367]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth
[02:52:43.072 --> 02:52:43.413]  We're good.
[02:53:01.283 --> 02:53:07.724]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[02:54:13.587 --> 02:54:22.832]  Final segment with Webster Griffin, Tarpley coming up in retransmission, Max Geiser, Lindsey Williams, and then of course again Tarpley, but we'll be back tomorrow live 11 a.m.
[02:54:22.832 --> 02:54:24.172]  to 2 p.m.
[02:54:24.172 --> 02:54:28.915]  Central Standard Time has some more informative and enlightening guests coming up.
[02:54:28.915 --> 02:54:35.318]  All I can say about the Liberty Movement worldwide and the awakening to the globalist crime syndicate is winning
[02:54:36.238 --> 02:54:40.443]  We are certainly making headway thanks to all of you out there taking action.
[02:54:40.443 --> 02:54:46.649]  We've got a fighting chance against this Anglo-American British Empire too.
[02:54:46.649 --> 02:54:50.353]  That's not blaming the British people or the American people or the Chinese people.
[02:54:50.353 --> 02:54:55.398]  When we talk about corruption in nations or the Israeli people, we talk about corruption in Israel or anywhere else.
[02:54:55.398 --> 02:54:56.740]  It's the system.
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:00.823]  This global corporate fascist system that we're dealing with.
[02:55:00.823 --> 02:55:02.845]  Webster, you heard all those questions I threw out.
[02:55:02.845 --> 02:55:05.006]  What do you think about what's happening in Saudi Arabia?
[02:55:05.006 --> 02:55:06.988]  What are the other spots they want to overthrow?
[02:55:06.988 --> 02:55:09.370]  Do the globalists want to overthrow all these puppet states?
[02:55:10.413 --> 02:55:15.678]  One of the things you can see is an attack on the nation-state itself, and I think this is very important.
[02:55:15.678 --> 02:55:19.982]  The essence of empire is that you've got a worldwide empire.
[02:55:19.982 --> 02:55:21.763]  You can call it the New World Order if you want to.
[02:55:21.763 --> 02:55:26.307]  It's simply the old world order, but in a more aggressive, extreme form.
[02:55:26.307 --> 02:55:34.275]  It's the International Monetary Fund, with NATO as the enforcers, with the US and the British running NATO, at least getting the assets that they need.
[02:55:35.015 --> 02:55:37.458]  So the true balkanization breakup?
[02:55:55.296 --> 02:55:56.056]  Precisely.
[02:55:56.056 --> 02:56:00.539]  The Bernard Lewis plan, three Iraqs, five, six Irans, and so on down the line.
[02:56:00.539 --> 02:56:03.180]  So everybody gets carved as a result of this.
[02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:06.242]  What you've been saying for decades was their plan there.
[02:56:06.242 --> 02:56:06.782]  I think so.
[02:56:06.782 --> 02:56:09.804]  And now, look at Algeria.
[02:56:09.804 --> 02:56:12.245]  If they can bring this into Algeria, they certainly will.
[02:56:12.245 --> 02:56:14.867]  The things they're interested in in North Africa would be what?
[02:56:14.867 --> 02:56:16.828]  Algerian oil, Libyan oil,
[02:56:17.563 --> 02:56:18.605]  The Suez Canal.
[02:56:18.605 --> 02:56:20.027]  Those are the assets.
[02:56:20.027 --> 02:56:21.649]  Those are valuable from the imperialists.
[02:56:21.649 --> 02:56:23.712]  And they've just started breaking Sudan into.
[02:56:23.712 --> 02:56:24.593]  They're really moving.
[02:56:24.593 --> 02:56:25.714]  And getting the oil there.
[02:56:25.714 --> 02:56:29.099]  So again, we're in an unprecedented imperialist rampage.
[02:56:29.099 --> 02:56:31.783]  Is this not basically a soft World War III?
[02:56:34.161 --> 02:56:51.827]  The one thing you would say is, if you compare this to 1848, in 1848 the British were destabilizing countries that were controlled by the Tsar of Russia, or the Austrian Emperor, or the King of Prussia, or whatever it was, in sort of enemy states, but now they're doing it to their own
[02:56:52.702 --> 02:56:53.262]  We're good to go.
[02:57:14.069 --> 02:57:19.215]  Saudi Arabia is now doomed, that they are going to be overthrown for sure.
[02:57:19.215 --> 02:57:26.242]  Now, the way that the royal family in Saudi Arabia fights back, it's very interesting, is with generous concessions.
[02:57:26.242 --> 02:57:30.146]  King Abdullah has now made about $36 billion worth of concessions.
[02:57:30.786 --> 02:57:37.950]  If you're living in Saudi Arabia, you just got yourself a nice pay increase, you got your health care for less and so forth.
[02:57:37.950 --> 02:57:42.712]  One of the things it shows, go into the streets, you might get somewhere.
[02:57:42.712 --> 02:57:52.818]  One of the things that occurred to me is, if the imperialists want to destabilize the world, let's turn the imperialist destabilization of the world into a destabilization of imperialism.
[02:57:52.818 --> 02:57:54.359]  Well, that was my next question.
[02:57:54.359 --> 02:57:55.879]  They're not invincible.
[02:57:55.879 --> 02:57:58.561]  They may not... I mean, is this going well for them right now?
[02:57:59.481 --> 02:58:02.264]  Uh, right now they have the initiative for sure.
[02:58:02.264 --> 02:58:06.689]  And you can see that there's a pushback from Russia in particular.
[02:58:06.689 --> 02:58:10.954]  The Russians saying that the story about strafing is a complete phony.
[02:58:10.954 --> 02:58:15.098]  We have Rogozin, the Russian observer at NATO.
[02:58:15.098 --> 02:58:17.941]  I'll tell you what, Webster, we're going to do five minutes overdrive so you can finish.
[02:58:17.941 --> 02:58:20.704]  Plus, I have new news that I knew was coming.
[02:58:21.385 --> 02:58:22.446]  But it just blew me away.
[02:58:22.446 --> 02:58:24.366]  We need to get it up on Infowars.com.
[02:58:24.366 --> 02:58:27.488]  It's only on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:58:27.488 --> 02:58:31.550]  Steve Watson, bombshell with mainstream confirmed reports.
[02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:36.272]  They're going to put full chest x-rays, frying your entire body in the airports.
[02:58:36.272 --> 02:58:38.173]  This is psychological warfare.
[02:58:38.173 --> 02:58:40.114]  It causes 15,000 deaths per year.
[02:58:40.114 --> 02:58:45.076]  Coming up.
[02:58:45.076 --> 02:58:49.038]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.533 --> 02:58:55.356]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:58:55.356 --> 02:58:59.660]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:58:59.660 --> 02:59:04.784]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:59:04.784 --> 02:59:10.289]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:59:10.289 --> 02:59:17.375]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:59:20.064 --> 02:59:25.606]  I'm looking for America.
[02:59:25.606 --> 02:59:27.227]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:59:27.227 --> 02:59:30.008]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:59:30.008 --> 02:59:34.449]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[02:59:34.449 --> 02:59:38.431]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:59:46.047 --> 02:59:52.312]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:59:52.312 --> 02:59:53.833]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.833 --> 02:59:55.895]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.895 --> 03:00:02.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:02.100 --> 03:00:08.124]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:08.124 --> 03:00:10.666]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.438 --> 03:00:15.721]  We are live into the fourth hour here with Webster Griffin, Tarpauline.
[03:00:15.721 --> 03:00:16.221]  It's 2 p.m.
[03:00:16.221 --> 03:00:17.062]  Central Standard Time.
[03:00:17.062 --> 03:00:18.083]  Thank you for joining us, Webster.
[03:00:18.083 --> 03:00:22.126]  I've got a huge story here I want to get into with the TSA.
[03:00:22.126 --> 03:00:28.472]  Security Theater Crete, full-strength x-ray body scanners touted for airports.
[03:00:28.472 --> 03:00:31.434]  Trials began for devices that could scan your insides.
[03:00:31.434 --> 03:00:35.678]  Deep penetrating radiation scans cause 15,000 deaths per year.
[03:00:35.678 --> 03:00:40.222]  They're exempt from radiation testing, violates law, violates OSHA.
[03:00:40.882 --> 03:00:43.964]  And they're doing this all over the world.
[03:00:43.964 --> 03:00:47.886]  I know we were just covering another subject, but this just went up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:47.886 --> 03:00:52.969]  They're now having TSA at checkpoints on highways, train stations.
[03:00:52.969 --> 03:00:55.190]  This is the federal Gestapo force.
[03:00:55.190 --> 03:01:01.574]  But what's going on with the establishment setting the precedent to now start chest X-raying the full body?
[03:01:01.574 --> 03:01:05.356]  I mean, what about the workers standing around this with no lead shielding?
[03:01:05.356 --> 03:01:08.258]  I mean, what's the point to all this?
[03:01:08.638 --> 03:01:20.232]  Well, it's probably a trial balloon, but remember, if the imperialists are on this worldwide rampage in foreign policy and destabilizations and putsches and color revolutions and coups,
[03:01:20.911 --> 03:01:27.897]  Then, of course, that has its reflection in domestic policy, and this is what you're seeing there.
[03:01:27.897 --> 03:01:31.200]  It's prisoner training, and then they can put us in a microwave.
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.021]  Now, why not put you in a full fryer?
[03:01:33.021 --> 03:01:37.745]  Yeah, I would say, though, people should focus on the idea of saying no to a U.S.
[03:01:37.745 --> 03:01:41.589]  invasion of Libya, no to a no-fly zone.
[03:01:42.489 --> 03:01:48.813]  The most effective way to do this is for an anti-war candidate to challenge Obama in the Democratic primaries.
[03:01:48.813 --> 03:02:01.660]  We're less than a year away from Iowa and New Hampshire, and if there's anybody interested in peace, avoiding war, inside the Democratic Party, they better come forward now, because otherwise the Democratic Party is pretty much a dead duck.
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:12.548]  Concerning the issues that we've been talking about, if I may mention, for those of you who are night owls out there, I think I'm going to be on coast-to-coast AM tonight, so if you want to tune in a couple hours.
[03:02:12.548 --> 03:02:12.728]  Good.
[03:02:12.728 --> 03:02:17.072]  When Alex is not on the air, and there's nothing to do anyway, you might as well... Well, I could care less, man.
[03:02:17.072 --> 03:02:19.474]  I mean, I'm happy for folks to hear you tonight.
[03:02:19.474 --> 03:02:20.655]  What hour are you on?
[03:02:20.655 --> 03:02:21.635]  Are you on the whole show?
[03:02:21.635 --> 03:02:24.157]  I think it's three hours, but I'm not certain.
[03:02:24.157 --> 03:02:25.599]  Well, well done, Tarpley.
[03:02:25.599 --> 03:02:27.280]  Be sure and give me an InfoWars plug on there.
[03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:35.582]  I'm joking Tarpley.
[03:02:35.582 --> 03:02:38.364]  I'm glad he's covering hardcore issues on the show.
[03:02:38.364 --> 03:02:42.346]  We appreciate him changing course away from what Art Bell used to do.
[03:02:42.346 --> 03:02:44.207]  That's why the show is so successful.
[03:02:44.207 --> 03:02:46.748]  There was another question I was asking before I came back.
[03:02:46.748 --> 03:02:48.009]  I just hope folks will get this
[03:02:48.709 --> 03:02:53.733]  This full x-ray machines now, you know, shooting through your body.
[03:02:53.733 --> 03:02:57.115]  Also, TSA lies justify illegal train station.
[03:02:57.115 --> 03:02:57.736]  We're up-down.
[03:02:57.736 --> 03:03:13.307]  But, I mean, in closing, Webster, to sit here and to watch the way CNN, MSNBC, Fox, all in unity, saying something must be done, something must be done, we must invade now, and then now it's going to set the precedent to invade every country.
[03:03:13.667 --> 03:03:16.590]  That has a dictator or a bunch of plutocrats suppressing people.
[03:03:16.590 --> 03:03:29.864]  I mean, I hope folks realize that this looks like the beginning of the launch of World War III with the cadre or derv to intro it by going in to help people in a humanitarian way.
[03:03:29.864 --> 03:03:32.467]  I mean, this is the full takeover of the Middle East, North Africa.
[03:03:33.211 --> 03:03:40.660]  This is the essence of Obama, is that you don't attack countries based on the stories that Bush, Cheney, and the neocons were telling.
[03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:45.767]  But now you have different stories that involve human rights and... You said that when he was running!
[03:03:45.767 --> 03:03:47.229]  You laid it all out, Webster!
[03:03:47.229 --> 03:03:47.869]  It's incredible!
[03:03:47.869 --> 03:03:49.672]  I mean, I just have to say you're incredible, Tarpley.
[03:03:50.759 --> 03:03:51.500]  Thank you very much.
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:53.901]  But the question now is what can we do about it?
[03:03:53.901 --> 03:03:57.684]  And I think the idea is people have to fight for their rights.
[03:03:57.684 --> 03:03:59.866]  I think it means fight for your economic rights.
[03:03:59.866 --> 03:04:02.368]  I have to tell you, I'm pro-Wisconsin.
[03:04:02.368 --> 03:04:06.591]  I think if they're going to take your union rights away, they can then come with an x-ray machine.
[03:04:06.591 --> 03:04:09.574]  This is sort of the same idea.
[03:04:09.574 --> 03:04:10.815]  But the main thing right now is
[03:04:11.515 --> 03:04:13.016]  No additional war.
[03:04:13.016 --> 03:04:14.236]  We've got three wars now.
[03:04:14.236 --> 03:04:15.677]  We've got Iraq still going.
[03:04:15.677 --> 03:04:17.138]  We've got Afghanistan.
[03:04:17.138 --> 03:04:18.238]  We've got Pakistan.
[03:04:18.238 --> 03:04:21.580]  And now we're going to add Libya and North Africa to this?
[03:04:21.580 --> 03:04:23.681]  These imperialists are just crazy.
[03:04:23.681 --> 03:04:30.384]  And these charming ladies, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, hitting in the United Nations.
[03:04:30.384 --> 03:04:32.925]  These people are crazy.
[03:04:32.925 --> 03:04:36.747]  This is Twilight of the Gods for the imperialists.
[03:04:36.747 --> 03:04:40.269]  The danger is with their flight forward, they could indeed get us into World War III.
[03:04:40.589 --> 03:04:41.891]  All right, Webster, we're out of time.
[03:04:41.891 --> 03:04:43.513]  I want to say bye to you during the break.
[03:04:43.513 --> 03:04:48.358]  Retransmission from Lebanon with Max Keiser and a lot more coming up.
[03:04:48.358 --> 03:04:49.880]  I'm going to get into the TSA as well.
[03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:52.383]  It was key information covered in the first hour.
[03:04:52.383 --> 03:04:54.605]  Please continue to spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:04:54.605 --> 03:04:55.827]  Great job, crew.
[03:04:55.827 --> 03:04:58.130]  We are winning!
[03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.750]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:58.750 --> 03:04:59.131]  Stay with us.
