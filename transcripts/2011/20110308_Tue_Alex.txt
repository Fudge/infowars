[00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:09.819]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.941]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:17.143]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:21.205]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.750]  We are live, my friends.
[00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.954]  It is Tuesday, the 8th day of March, 2011.
[00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:37.863]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and this is going to be an absolutely jam-packed key.
[00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:41.495]  Key transmission.
[00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:59.441]  Lord Christopher Monckton to join us coming up in about 20 minutes to break down the criminal activities of the big megabanks pushing the fake environmental global carbon tax movement and the open announcements in England
[00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:11.004]  That people will not have regular electricity to their homes and that this has to be done to save the earth from the evil carbon dioxide.
[00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:20.773]  So the planned artificial scarcity, the neo-feudalistic serfdom, we're going to be breaking that down with Lord Christopher Monckton coming up.
[00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:22.735]  Then Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:35.343]  When he was on with us a few months ago, he said, Alex, you tend to focus on chemicals in food and water, pharmakia, to manipulate the human mind.
[00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:41.787]  And he said, certainly, there's thousands of government documents on that front, and we know that's going on.
[00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:52.894]  But he said, most of the funding and most of the research is psychotronic, deals with electronic different fields.
[00:01:55.123 --> 00:02:12.814]  And since then, I've read a lot of patents and even mainstream news articles where they admit not just the message in TV, not just the overt propaganda, not just the flicker rate that puts you into a mesmerized sleep-type state where you're subconsciously accepting everything.
[00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:36.733]  It cuts off the critical areas of the brain, the left and right lobes of the cerebral cortex, but actual programming directly into the lower centers of the brain, breathing, eating, sex drive, all of it, that they can actually program it.
[00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:41.076]  They can kill you now with a television set.
[00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:43.677]  These are patented.
[00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:49.780]  If they want to, folks, they can kill you with a television set.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.220]  Kill you!
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.781]  Let me say it again.
[00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.502]  Kill you!
[00:02:56.502 --> 00:03:01.204]  You remember about 12 years ago, tens of thousands of Japanese children went into convulsions?
[00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:23.343]  All over the country, when an episode of Pokemon aired that they later admitted was a quote, test of the flashing strobe, just with a strobe timed to the child level algorithms of the brain, they were able to cause convulsions.
[00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.452]  Tens of thousands, boom, as it airs, simultaneously falling out of their chairs.
[00:03:31.452 --> 00:03:39.195]  Now, if you know these systems exist, which they do, the question is, will the globalists use it?
[00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:47.758]  Well, you know their motto, an unused weapon is a useless weapon, and you're thinking, well, I'll just turn the television set off.
[00:03:47.758 --> 00:03:50.599]  Oh, I'm sorry, they can do it through fluorescent light bulbs.
[00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:56.104]  That's why under law, they're banning all the phosphorescent and phasing them out in the next three years.
[00:03:56.104 --> 00:04:01.307]  The bans began this year of the higher watts down.
[00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:05.649]  They're gonna be able to mind control us with the streetlights.
[00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:09.992]  Folks, how many things have you tuned into and laughed at and years later it's mainstream news?
[00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:18.436]  Kind of like I told you 15 years ago, they're taking all baby's blood at birth and putting it in the secret DNA database with the Pentagon for bioweapons.
[00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:20.678]  Now that's all been declassified in the last 12 months.
[00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:22.918]  Of course, we had the documents.
[00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:24.919]  You didn't listen to us when we had them.
[00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.821]  I have all the different patents.
[00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:27.701]  That's not true.
[00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.583]  There are so many thousands that I don't have them all.
[00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.665]  I've read hundreds.
[00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:35.867]  Where they can kill you.
[00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:39.870]  And by the way, you can't even tell the light is flashing.
[00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.674]  It does it at a certain rate and they know how to exactly program the brain.
[00:04:46.448 --> 00:04:48.289]  You know where they're putting them in first?
[00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.710]  Government buildings.
[00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.872]  Because they're not going to kill their zombies up front.
[00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:58.516]  They're going to brainwash them and get them ready for the evil work they're doing as they're in sleepwalking trances.
[00:04:58.516 --> 00:04:59.517]  An army of zombies.
[00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:08.546]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:11.227]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:20.268]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:05:20.268 --> 00:05:28.530]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.210]  Move quickly while you can still afford
[00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.950]  We're good to go.
[00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:01.227]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:08.154]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:10.716]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:15.881]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:19.122]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.122 --> 00:06:21.442]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.442 --> 00:06:27.683]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:31.064]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.064 --> 00:06:36.845]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:38.486]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:39.786]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:42.467]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:43.867]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:06:44.147 --> 00:06:46.490]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:05.564]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.564 --> 00:07:14.431]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:19.055]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:29.884]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.504 --> 00:07:40.007]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.007 --> 00:07:45.449]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:52.932]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:55.693]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:03.538]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.538 --> 00:08:06.325]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:18.995]  We have a very important radio broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.837]  It is, of course, Tuesday, the 8th of March, 2011.
[00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:27.960]  Hard to believe we're already in the third month of 2011, steaming quickly towards 2012.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.062]  Coming up in the next hour, Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:08:38.467 --> 00:09:00.322]  Who is one of the leading experts on psychotronic mind control systems will be joining us and the reason I have him coming on is I'm seeing more and more mainstream news articles and admitting that television can actually not just put you into a highly suggestible dream state so that you accept the verbal
[00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:15.258]  and visual propaganda being fed to you, but that it can actually even affect your health, your wellness with encoded digital messages within the transmission itself.
[00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:29.819]  And now they're shifting over to phosphorescent bulbs to the fluorescent bulbs and admitting that the government's going to have data transmission over the light bulbs in your house.
[00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:35.763]  That's why they're making it the law all over the world that you've got to have the fluorescents, no more phosphorescent.
[00:09:35.763 --> 00:09:39.745]  Because now this is rolling into government buildings from Texas to Minnesota.
[00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:57.954]  The light bulbs are, quote, communicating with the computers and security systems in the building at ultra-fast wavelength levels, flickering on and off, that the human eye cannot consciously perceive.
[00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:08.099]  And under those very patents, you find the sub-patents for mind control and causing physiological developments in the human body.
[00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:12.997]  And this, of course, ties into things like smart meters.
[00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:19.222]  Five, six years ago, they announced in San Francisco, as the beta test, where they're totally liberal, totally trendy.
[00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:21.824]  They would slit their throats if told it was liberal.
[00:10:21.824 --> 00:10:25.207]  They would throw their children into meat grinders if they were told it was liberal.
[00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:26.909]  They're told, it's liberal.
[00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:29.391]  The government's gonna remote control your thermostat.
[00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:31.652]  It's gonna cut back on carbon.
[00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:35.516]  And then folks read the actual documents and we said, well, wait a minute.
[00:10:35.996 --> 00:10:40.538]  You say you're going to control our thermostat with this and decide when we have power.
[00:10:40.538 --> 00:10:42.058]  And they said, no, we're not.
[00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.899]  And then a few years later, you bet we are.
[00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:46.840]  And you don't have a choice.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.862]  During peak times, we're going to cut your air conditioner on or off, cut your heat on or off.
[00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:56.784]  Then they said, oh, actually, just to cut your carbon footprint, we're going to lower it anyways.
[00:10:56.784 --> 00:11:00.665]  Or if we see that there's too much you're spending, charge you more.
[00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:02.746]  It's all about artificial scarcity.
[00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:17.241]  It's all about taking things and infrastructure that we've built and then raping you, squeezing you by these consolidated elite cartels.
[00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:32.092]  And it's about all the new under federal regulations, it's the same in many other first world nations, the dishwashers, the clothes washers, the entertainment centers, the
[00:11:33.237 --> 00:11:33.757]  We're good to go!
[00:11:52.486 --> 00:12:03.889]  What ads you watch, they have built-in microphones and cameras on the Kinetic Microsoft video game system that face scans you and can record up to seven different people's voices in real time.
[00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:17.694]  I mean, they're just rolling Big Brother out, just like the cell phones under federal law in 1996 track us all in real time via GPS and they can dial in even when the phone's turned off and listen to you.
[00:12:17.694 --> 00:12:22.035]  And of course we were kooky to tell you that in 96 because we had the Telecommunications Act.
[00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:31.189]  But people didn't want to listen, and then by about 2003, Fox News and others said, Big Brother, eat your heart out.
[00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:36.676]  The government's listening to everything you do with AI computers, no warrants, and it's good.
[00:12:36.676 --> 00:12:41.962]  Hey, schools all over the country, from Philadelphia to Sacramento,
[00:12:43.524 --> 00:12:49.488]  From California to Pennsylvania, the schools are watching you at home on your laptop in the shower.
[00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:51.489]  And the school told on themselves.
[00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:55.912]  They're proud of it, and the court said, go ahead and do it.
[00:12:55.912 --> 00:12:57.773]  We're going to take your baby's blood.
[00:12:57.773 --> 00:13:02.516]  We're going to put telescreens up in the Walmarts and at 9,000 other locations.
[00:13:02.516 --> 00:13:06.518]  The TSA is going to be at train stations, bus stations, and highway checkpoints.
[00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:08.720]  The police are going to take your blood without warrants.
[00:13:09.895 --> 00:13:19.478]  The ATF's gonna order gun shops to register people even though they're not supposed to, there's no law, they're just gonna do it.
[00:13:19.478 --> 00:13:21.618]  And why are they so confident?
[00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:31.261]  Because they've got the high-def TV with scientific patents to literally be able to program your brain like you program a VCR.
[00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:36.993]  To be able to program everything you're doing.
[00:13:36.993 --> 00:13:38.975]  That's why they're so confident.
[00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:43.478]  We've taken the bait of the iPads and the iPhones and the whole system.
[00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:47.281]  Humanity is being absorbed by the technocracy.
[00:13:47.281 --> 00:13:51.064]  The globalists have engineered the sixth great extinction.
[00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:52.565]  They're heralding it now.
[00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:56.608]  We are now entering the vortex.
[00:13:56.608 --> 00:13:57.329]  You have been warned.
[00:14:00.186 --> 00:14:13.253]  You've got the average person out there operating at a caveman level intellect facing globalist 21st century mind control.
[00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:24.198]  And if people won't even admit they're under psychological warfare attack, how are they going to admit that they're under psychotronic attack?
[00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.179]  Let me explain to you.
[00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:27.760]  There are hundreds and hundreds of patents I've read.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.161]  There are thousands on record.
[00:14:30.066 --> 00:14:43.764]  There are hundreds and hundreds of mainstream news articles going back decades where DARPA comes out and says, yeah, we're testing towers in major cities that will calm you during emergencies with different wavelengths to calm and soothe the public.
[00:14:43.764 --> 00:14:46.007]  We're already under this, folks.
[00:14:46.007 --> 00:14:47.610]  That's why your neighbors are in a trance.
[00:14:50.532 --> 00:15:05.241]  It was on record when TV was first rolled out in the 40s that after a few minutes of watching TV, the first time you watch television, it takes on average about an hour in the major studies that you can pull up online for someone to have suspended disbelief.
[00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:16.067]  After someone has had suspended disbelief one time, it takes on average about two minutes.
[00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:19.529]  The eyes are a electrochemical,
[00:15:21.482 --> 00:15:23.303]  Coupler.
[00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:26.645]  Your eyes are the window to your mind, your soul.
[00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:34.410]  Your eyes are the electrochemical receiver couplers.
[00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.272]  Just like you have infrared systems that can transmit data over.
[00:15:37.272 --> 00:15:40.934]  Just like they have light bulbs now that communicate with your computers.
[00:15:40.934 --> 00:15:42.715]  That's what your eyes are doing.
[00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:46.437]  They're receivers.
[00:15:46.437 --> 00:15:47.218]  They're stalks.
[00:15:47.218 --> 00:15:50.300]  When you're in your embryonic development, just a few weeks into development,
[00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:54.931]  From the back of the brain grows the eye stalks.
[00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:57.453]  In fact, your eyes are brain tissue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:57.453 --> 00:16:02.756]  When you're looking at someone's eyes, you're looking at their brain.
[00:16:02.756 --> 00:16:03.937]  You're looking into my eyes right now.
[00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:06.298]  You're looking at Alex Jones's brain.
[00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:10.201]  My most important sense.
[00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:12.042]  My brain looking right at you.
[00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:15.344]  Your brain looking right back at me right now.
[00:16:15.344 --> 00:16:21.008]  Now, you're not just looking at the image and the audio of what I'm saying and doing.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.062]  Your body is picking up the body language.
[00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:26.703]  It's picking up the tones.
[00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:31.847]  It's picking up from an instinctive level, whether you think I'm telling the truth or not.
[00:16:31.847 --> 00:16:39.292]  You're intellectually also scanning for data you have to see if it compares and matches what I'm saying.
[00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:42.695]  But the globalists can now trump all of that.
[00:16:42.695 --> 00:16:47.078]  They can feed through, even though I'm sending out a clear signal,
[00:16:48.237 --> 00:16:56.360]  They can feed over the broadcast or transmission signal after they get my original signal, the video stream we're sending out.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:05.142]  They can add magnetic light energy in the patents.
[00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:06.363]  There's three different ways to do it.
[00:17:06.363 --> 00:17:07.203]  They can embed it.
[00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:35.040]  To make you docile, to make you hungry, to make you angry, to make you be sexually aroused, to make you go into a deeper sleep state, and they can even ratchet down your sleep state until you go into a oxygen deprivation zone of deep sleep, which is near death and can even put you into death.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.280]  You understand that?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.661]  We're being hit by
[00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:42.355]  Mega 21st century advanced technology.
[00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:44.975]  That's why the globalists don't care what we think anymore.
[00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:48.776]  That's why they don't care about Alex Jones.
[00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.756]  They know the average yuppie watching this is just going to laugh.
[00:17:51.756 --> 00:17:58.298]  It's totally defenseless.
[00:17:58.298 --> 00:18:03.239]  We've got to have debates about this and what we're going to do in the future and how we're going to respond to this.
[00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:04.399]  Because this is all real.
[00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:05.039]  This is happening.
[00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:11.353]  Now on another issue, because we don't normally have guests on in the first hour, but the only time we could have him is in the first hour.
[00:18:11.353 --> 00:18:16.636]  Lord Monckton's coming on about some issues that connect in with all of this.
[00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:25.840]  Then we've got the whole mind control, psychotronic, light wave, electromagnetic manipulation of the mind coming up in the second hour.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:34.945]  The third hour is gonna be absolutely paramount important, because I'm going to give people the decipher code key
[00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:37.425]  Not that it's hard.
[00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:40.947]  It's like having a pair of keys and sticking it in your car and starting it.
[00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:46.330]  But if you don't have the keys, it's really hard to start that car.
[00:18:46.330 --> 00:19:05.061]  I have the keys from the Globalist Donut Missions of exactly the synthesis, the dialectics they're using with Michael Moore coming out and saying, you don't own your own wealth.
[00:19:07.057 --> 00:19:08.497]  It's a natural resource.
[00:19:08.497 --> 00:19:11.858]  It's a national resource.
[00:19:11.858 --> 00:19:19.500]  And the Wisconsin protesters coming up to Tea Party people and saying, you don't have a right to your own money.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.461]  And they're serious.
[00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:24.282]  And they're trying to stop them from having their free speech.
[00:19:24.282 --> 00:19:25.442]  These are tyrants.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.363]  Now, the governor of Wisconsin is a tyrant.
[00:19:32.363 --> 00:19:34.185]  So are the unions.
[00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:38.988]  See, the globalists know you're operating in a one-dimensional facet.
[00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:43.792]  So they're saying either the unions are bad or the governor's bad.
[00:19:43.792 --> 00:19:44.813]  No.
[00:19:44.813 --> 00:19:48.776]  They're all within a controlled political paradigm.
[00:19:48.776 --> 00:19:50.397]  And I'm gonna break this down.
[00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:52.539]  You know, Michael Moore talks about the bankers being crooks?
[00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:53.439]  Yeah.
[00:19:53.439 --> 00:19:56.842]  But see, they engineered the socialist system to get the money.
[00:19:58.217 --> 00:19:59.330]  We're gonna break it all down.
[00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:08.241]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:31.526]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.526 --> 00:20:36.089]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.089 --> 00:20:41.893]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.893 --> 00:20:45.555]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.555 --> 00:20:48.257]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:53.320]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:53.581]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.581 --> 00:20:54.962]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.567 --> 00:21:01.993]  America, you've been warned.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.541]  Shake the very foundations of our nation.
[00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:12.924]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:12.924 --> 00:21:16.586]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:17.407]  Have you?
[00:21:17.407 --> 00:21:23.491]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life.
[00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:28.714]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:21:28.714 --> 00:21:29.895]  Could this really happen?
[00:21:29.895 --> 00:21:33.878]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:37.380]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:37.800]  We're good.
[00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:05.062]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:06.483]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:06.483 --> 00:22:10.485]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:10.485 --> 00:22:13.227]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:13.227 --> 00:22:15.208]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:17.529]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:27.433]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:30.795]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:33.896]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:24:13.254 --> 00:24:15.196]  Okay, we've only got to the end of the hour.
[00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:17.297]  The Dr. Nick Begich is going to be joining us.
[00:24:17.297 --> 00:24:20.120]  Then I'll get into the third hour.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.824]  These Wisconsin protesters on video saying, you have no right to your money.
[00:24:25.824 --> 00:24:27.366]  They actually believe it.
[00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:31.249]  And if you don't think that means you're a slave, it means they'll put you in a forced labor camp.
[00:24:31.249 --> 00:24:33.251]  I mean, these are the heirs of Stalin.
[00:24:34.351 --> 00:24:40.877]  But we're going to look at the other end of that, that you have the big corrupt multinational banks that nobody wants to talk about.
[00:24:40.877 --> 00:24:45.241]  So we're going to be discussing that in the third hour today after Dr. Nick Begich joins us.
[00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:51.426]  Lord Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount of Monckton and Brenchley, formerly a member of the Conservative Party.
[00:24:51.426 --> 00:24:54.809]  Monckton has been the Deputy Leader of the UK Independence Party since 2010.
[00:24:54.809 --> 00:24:55.810]  He served in Conservative
[00:24:59.053 --> 00:24:59.273]  I think?
[00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:18.987]  I don't know.
[00:25:39.241 --> 00:25:58.765]  Article out of the Daily Telegraph, era of constant electricity at home is ending, says Power Chief, and he says that it's true, that it's good, that England will be like North Korea in the next 10 years, and that you won't have power a lot of the time, but that's good to cut your carbon footprint.
[00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:11.302]  It's just pathetic how the entire governing class has become infected with what really one could only call a sort of post-Marxist desperation.
[00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:15.311]  They are longing to shut down the economies of the West.
[00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:25.977]  And when the likes of you and me, Alex, began saying this, that this was their real agenda, we were told we were extremists, we were lunatics, we were frothing at the mouth, we didn't know what we were talking about.
[00:26:25.977 --> 00:26:31.200]  Now they're coming out more and more openly and saying it publicly.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.263]  And instead of the wall-to-wall outrage that ought to be happening,
[00:26:35.543 --> 00:26:41.265]  People are just saying, yes, we got used to these people, they say this sort of thing, perhaps they don't really mean it.
[00:26:41.265 --> 00:26:54.771]  Just the same kind of rabbit-in-the-headlights response as we saw in the run-up to Hitler, when he began saying similar extraordinary things, and people just quietly looked the other way and said, well, let's all be nice to him and hope that he goes away.
[00:26:55.526 --> 00:27:01.930]  The fact is we can't allow these people any longer to get away with what they're getting away with.
[00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:16.100]  What they're doing is exploiting our democratic tolerance and understanding in the hope that they can destroy it forever and shut it down and put in its place something a great deal more authoritarian.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.642]  Let me give you, first of all, a bit of background to the
[00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:23.864]  The chief of the National Grid here in the UK.
[00:27:23.864 --> 00:27:40.810]  Now what he's talking about, though he hasn't admitted it publicly, but I have made some investigations privately so I can tell your viewers and listeners, and you can be the first to know this, that during the cold snap, indeed the coldest December since records began in 1659 in central England,
[00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:51.858]  The power grid came in the UK, throughout the whole of the UK, within just 3% of its capacity.
[00:27:51.858 --> 00:28:00.502]  And of course, if you reach anything like that capacity, you can trip the whole grid out and black out not just part of the country, but the whole country.
[00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:03.663]  That very, very nearly happened.
[00:28:03.663 --> 00:28:04.504]  Why did it happen?
[00:28:05.405 --> 00:28:06.826]  And by the way, Lord Monten,
[00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:22.980]  That actually happened all over the U.S.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:30.364]  and the White House actually attacked PrisonPlanet.com in our article and said we were liars, that they didn't have an anti-power plant agenda.
[00:28:30.364 --> 00:28:37.647]  But then the next week their energy secretary came out and said we're going to have massive coal plant closures on top of what they've already had.
[00:28:37.647 --> 00:28:42.570]  And now the head of your energy program says get ready to not have power a lot of the time.
[00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.610]  That's right.
[00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.513]  I mean, and the background to this is that we really, we very nearly didn't get it.
[00:28:47.513 --> 00:28:48.554]  And why?
[00:28:48.554 --> 00:28:54.858]  It's because the windmills that are supposed to be generating 5% of our electricity weren't generating any.
[00:28:54.858 --> 00:29:01.103]  Their contribution to the grid in December was 0.0%, because the wind basically didn't blow.
[00:29:01.103 --> 00:29:02.404]  We were under a blocking high.
[00:29:02.404 --> 00:29:05.126]  That's when you need the windmills the most, and they're not there.
[00:29:05.766 --> 00:29:19.436]  So closing down these coal plants and thinking you can replace them with useless windmills that cost 26 times as much to generate electricity, this is not a forward-thinking, radical or sensible green energy policy.
[00:29:19.436 --> 00:29:31.324]  The only green energy policy that would work to keep the lights on and the wheels of industry turning, and prosperity as well, is to go nuclear if you don't want to keep the coal-fired plants.
[00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:41.293]  And quite frankly, Lord Monckton, and we'll get your view on this on the other side, I think that nukes overall are not as good as coal.
[00:29:41.293 --> 00:29:46.377]  We got so much of it, it's completely clean now, and carbon dioxide is good for plants.
[00:29:46.377 --> 00:29:47.598]  I say more coal plants.
[00:29:47.598 --> 00:29:50.781]  Good for the Earth.
[00:29:50.781 --> 00:29:52.182]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.182 --> 00:29:54.704]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.704 --> 00:29:57.387]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:05.756]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.756 --> 00:30:08.999]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:13.803]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.803 --> 00:30:20.188]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.188 --> 00:30:22.430]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:23.270]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:23.790]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.451]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:25.731]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.731 --> 00:30:27.972]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.877 --> 00:30:46.240]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.142]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:30:49.142 --> 00:30:58.268]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.302 --> 00:31:04.845]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.845 --> 00:31:05.765]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:09.188]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.188 --> 00:31:10.048]  Number 2.
[00:31:10.048 --> 00:31:14.951]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:15.692]  It's true.
[00:31:15.692 --> 00:31:20.555]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.555 --> 00:31:21.395]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.395 --> 00:31:24.978]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.978 --> 00:31:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.680]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.421]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.421 --> 00:31:36.102]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:36.902]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.902 --> 00:31:41.043]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.043 --> 00:31:46.105]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.290]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:08.234]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.234 --> 00:32:10.776]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.776 --> 00:32:16.159]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.159 --> 00:32:19.201]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.201 --> 00:32:21.262]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.522 --> 00:32:27.767]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.767 --> 00:32:31.149]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:36.933]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:36.933 --> 00:32:38.574]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.574 --> 00:32:39.875]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:42.537]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.537 --> 00:32:46.780]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.481]  You can find the video at www.
[00:32:49.562 --> 00:32:51.384]  End of America 3.com.
[00:32:51.384 --> 00:32:53.967]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:33:02.917 --> 00:33:06.762]  We're good to go.
[00:33:20.737 --> 00:33:22.678]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest.
[00:33:22.678 --> 00:33:37.204]  He is the leading voice and expert with precision cutting up the lies and propaganda of the fake environmental lobby who could care less about the earth and real environmental problems that we do certainly have.
[00:33:37.204 --> 00:33:38.965]  It's all about grabbing resources.
[00:33:39.925 --> 00:33:52.830]  Similar to Obama handing out 1,040 waivers to McDonald's and others, where their hundreds of thousands of employees don't have to get insurance, but then their competition does.
[00:33:52.830 --> 00:34:05.555]  So this is also about king-making, where you've got to get the license, licensure, not evenly from government, of the people, but license to be able to operate.
[00:34:06.235 --> 00:34:08.835]  And again, here's the Daily Telegraph.
[00:34:08.835 --> 00:34:10.256]  This is their words, not mine.
[00:34:10.256 --> 00:34:20.618]  This is written by the head of the energy program there in England.
[00:34:20.618 --> 00:34:29.699]  And he says that the UK power chief says that the days of permanently available electricity may be coming to an end.
[00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.920]  And it goes on, the head of the power network said yesterday, and then it has the quotes
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.465]  From him saying, yes, we're going to change our behavior, consume less.
[00:34:38.465 --> 00:34:39.946]  But yes, it's not going to be cheap.
[00:34:39.946 --> 00:34:41.188]  It's not going to be easily available.
[00:34:41.188 --> 00:34:46.414]  And you will not have power all the time as a society that this is clear.
[00:34:46.414 --> 00:34:47.876]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[00:34:47.876 --> 00:34:49.918]  But then meanwhile, the U.N.
[00:34:49.918 --> 00:34:51.900]  lobbies in England to shut down the oldest
[00:34:52.561 --> 00:35:02.305]  Steel plant in England and then give the money to Pachari at the UN to move it to India.
[00:35:02.305 --> 00:35:11.690]  I mean, isn't this really just about the globalists have made their investments in China and if they can shut down Western Europe, England, the US, their investments go up.
[00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.211]  I mean, it's not just hatred of America in England.
[00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:17.752]  I mean, that's the cherry on top.
[00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:21.094]  But I mean, isn't it more just about shutting down their competition, Lord Monckton?
[00:35:21.917 --> 00:35:32.649]  Certainly a very big element of greed and self-interest on the part of the Neo-Marxists who are doing to us what they are doing to us.
[00:35:32.649 --> 00:35:39.737]  And just to go back to what the head of the grid said, he said this because windmills have been destabilizing the national grid.
[00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:43.301]  Nobody who operates a centralized grid likes to have windmills on it because
[00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:53.547]  They're so unpredictable, you can't plan for when the wind's going to blow and when it's suddenly going to stop, and so it destabilises the entire structure and puts all your power at risk.
[00:35:53.547 --> 00:36:05.013]  But the more serious underlying problem is that because the governing class has gone stupid and has allowed itself to be fooled by a tiny clique of mad, bad scientists,
[00:36:05.513 --> 00:36:18.079]  into believing that adding a little carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is going to cause major changes to the climate, when we've now had 60 years of evidence that it isn't going to make major changes to the climate.
[00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:22.101]  They're banning the building of new coal-fired plants.
[00:36:22.101 --> 00:36:28.704]  You were mentioning Obama having done that, having then told you you were a liar when you said he'd done it.
[00:36:28.704 --> 00:36:32.186]  He said, before the election had even taken place,
[00:36:32.686 --> 00:36:41.209]  That he intended to shut down coal-fired plants and to make coal prohibitively expensive and to tax people who used it and punish them for using it.
[00:36:41.209 --> 00:36:46.290]  And now he's trying to tell you you're a liar when he actually does what he said he was going to do.
[00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:54.413]  It is a disgrace that they are attacking the coal industry in this way, which is one of the bravest and most useful industries we have.
[00:36:54.413 --> 00:36:57.214]  Modern methods of burning coal are not dangerous.
[00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.394]  They don't pollute.
[00:36:58.394 --> 00:37:00.535]  They do put a little carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
[00:37:00.815 --> 00:37:03.596]  Lord Monkton, please explain that.
[00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:07.556]  Please explain that because I've happened to study it myself.
[00:37:07.556 --> 00:37:11.537]  In the modern plants, nothing comes out but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[00:37:11.537 --> 00:37:17.438]  They run it through a whole bunch of different cleaning systems, condensers.
[00:37:17.438 --> 00:37:19.098]  It's all purified out.
[00:37:19.098 --> 00:37:22.879]  But then the media gets up there and says these plants are incredibly toxic.
[00:37:22.879 --> 00:37:27.780]  We've got to stop the carbon pollution because all that's left is carbon dioxide.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.380]  So they spin it and call carbon dioxide carbon.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:44.426]  It is pure deception, and it means they haven't kept abreast with the really quite dramatic changes in the technology for burning coal in power stations.
[00:37:44.426 --> 00:37:47.728]  Let me describe, if I may, just one or two of the things that are now being done.
[00:37:47.728 --> 00:37:51.830]  A colleague of mine called Steve Whittaker at Cambridge.
[00:37:52.390 --> 00:38:12.547]  When I was there, was already studying this, and had come to the conclusion that you could improve the methods of combustion known as circulating fluidized bed combustion, by which you crush the coal into small particles, and then you kind of have it on a cushion of air and burn it that way, very, very hot.
[00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:18.951]  And very little dirt comes out of that process, because the combustion is made much more complete.
[00:38:18.951 --> 00:38:24.055]  And the more complete the combustion, the fewer the particulate bits of pollution you get out of it.
[00:38:24.055 --> 00:38:24.615]  It's turbocharged!
[00:38:24.615 --> 00:38:38.825]  The few that remain, they now scrub out by using flue gas scrubbing, by using various methods of washing, so that, as you say, all that you really get out of a coal plant these days is water vapour, which is harmless, and CO2, which is not just harmless, it's beneficial.
[00:38:40.475 --> 00:38:41.297]  Very well said.
[00:38:41.297 --> 00:38:45.769]  Now, going back to the previous question, what's your view on nuclear versus coal?
[00:38:45.769 --> 00:38:48.757]  There's no doubt that we need both.
[00:38:49.722 --> 00:38:54.346]  Because we're going to get this continuing pressure on the coal industry.
[00:38:54.346 --> 00:39:00.892]  It began under the KGB in the 1970s and early 80s.
[00:39:00.892 --> 00:39:14.845]  It was they who engineered the two minor strikes of the UK, one of which brought down Edward Heath's government in 1974, and another where they tried to do the same again in 1982-3, and they failed because we were ready for them.
[00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:17.747]  By the way, the Russian government's pushing peak oil as well today.
[00:39:34.176 --> 00:39:35.797]  Well, we'll come on to that in a moment.
[00:39:35.797 --> 00:39:36.577]  Let me just tell this story.
[00:39:36.577 --> 00:39:37.998]  Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[00:39:37.998 --> 00:39:44.881]  Because they then sent him to the Lenin Institute, where the really serious terrorists like Yasser Arafat were trained.
[00:39:44.881 --> 00:39:52.485]  And he was then sent back to Britain to try to destroy our energy-based economy by shutting down the coal industry.
[00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:54.226]  And he didn't succeed.
[00:39:54.226 --> 00:39:54.726]  We beat him.
[00:39:55.426 --> 00:40:01.230]  And now Obama is doing the same thing, but this time from the President's office.
[00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:13.619]  No longer directed by the KGB because he believed the same sort of things that the KGB believed in those days, and he seems to me to be perfectly willing to shut America down for reasons which are very difficult to fathom because
[00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:20.123]  This is, whether he likes it or not, his country now, even if he was born in Kenya, as some say.
[00:40:20.123 --> 00:40:22.444]  The fact is, he's now an American citizen.
[00:40:22.444 --> 00:40:25.526]  And as an American citizen, he owes a duty of loyalty to his country.
[00:40:25.526 --> 00:40:33.531]  And you don't go around shutting down the country's primary source of energy if you really believe in the future of your country.
[00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:37.994]  It's the wrong way for a president to behave, and he should stop doing that.
[00:40:38.494 --> 00:40:48.445]  He should also look, in my view, much more carefully at the science behind this climate nonsense, which is now, frankly, collapsing with every new scientific paper that comes out.
[00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.927]  It's now blindingly clear.
[00:40:49.927 --> 00:40:56.114]  There's been a very important paper published just a few months ago by Dr. Roy Spencer, whom I'm sure you know well.
[00:40:57.112 --> 00:40:57.512]  We're good to go.
[00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:26.019]  And that actually causes a cooling of the planet, which largely offsets any warming you might get from CO2, and greatly changes all the numbers, so that we're not going to see very much warming over the next hundred years at all.
[00:41:26.019 --> 00:41:31.506]  Maybe, he thinks, half a degree Celsius, maybe one degree Celsius, that's two degrees Fahrenheit, absolute max.
[00:41:32.046 --> 00:41:35.407]  This is not, on any view, any kind of a problem.
[00:41:35.407 --> 00:41:40.589]  So we need to go right back to the science and remember there is no need to do any of this.
[00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:50.633]  But then you talk of the alternative energies that they're trying to... These windmills they're putting up everywhere, for instance, which kill birds in large numbers, but they don't produce very much electricity.
[00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:54.334]  And electricity they do produce is produced at monumental cost.
[00:41:54.754 --> 00:42:02.149]  The largest such wind farm in the world is the Thanet Wind Array that's just off the coast of Kent in England.
[00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:14.016]  And that is subsidized to the tune of $2 billion for one wind farm over the next 20 years, guaranteed by the British taxpayer, whether he likes it or not, through the government.
[00:42:14.016 --> 00:42:31.909]  And if every measure to make global warming go away were as cost-ineffective as the Sannit wind array, then to forestall the 3.4 Celsius or 6.8, around 6 Fahrenheit degrees of warming that the UN expects to happen in the next 100 years,
[00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:37.614]  Well, Lord Monckton, is this just not economic warfare by the insiders seizing the energy infrastructure?
[00:42:37.614 --> 00:42:39.456]  You said something that is central to everything.
[00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:39.856]  England
[00:42:55.009 --> 00:43:04.732]  The United States, Canada, the wealthy nations of the planet are energy-based and idea-based economies.
[00:43:04.732 --> 00:43:13.294]  Our countries are set up to be energy-rich, and so you cut the energy off to some third-world country, sure, people are going to die.
[00:43:13.894 --> 00:43:19.356]  But if you start cutting the energy off to a first world nation, we are going to completely implode.
[00:43:19.356 --> 00:43:22.857]  We live in far spread out areas.
[00:43:22.857 --> 00:43:26.078]  We are designed around the combustion engine.
[00:43:26.078 --> 00:43:32.220]  We are designed around coal powered plants that supply over 50% of our power here in the US.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.982]  We can't compete if we don't have it.
[00:43:34.982 --> 00:43:37.504]  And China's building three to five a week.
[00:43:37.504 --> 00:43:39.965]  We don't even get two or three a year.
[00:43:39.965 --> 00:43:43.308]  They have covertly been shutting down or stopping hundreds.
[00:43:43.308 --> 00:43:47.351]  I just put on screen the news articles where they say they're going to shut down thousands.
[00:43:47.351 --> 00:43:53.115]  I mean, this is economic savage warfare and is high treason.
[00:43:53.115 --> 00:43:55.757]  And we must, must resist them.
[00:43:55.757 --> 00:43:57.218]  What are your ideas to stop them?
[00:43:57.218 --> 00:43:59.500]  Because here's my second point.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:05.284]  As a caveat to that, here's the French news agency.
[00:44:05.284 --> 00:44:21.455]  So is this a self-fulfilling prophecy where all these global warming people say, humans are bad, we'd be better off without them, we need eco-fascism,
[00:44:21.775 --> 00:44:39.248]  But get ready for humans to die everywhere, so that as they cut the power supplies off, especially the third world, and a billion plus die, they then claim that's part of the mass extinction caused by the imaginary global warming, when they themselves, the neo-eugenicists, have triggered it.
[00:44:39.248 --> 00:44:42.991]  I think we've got to look very carefully at the motives of some of these people.
[00:44:44.449 --> 00:45:03.282]  Remember that we had for many decades, throughout the first, really the first three quarters of the 20th century, we had an active communist Marxist system that was trying to destroy the economies of the West and had learned that the way to destroy them was via energy.
[00:45:03.282 --> 00:45:07.564]  Now, when the Berlin Wall came down, these people did not disappear.
[00:45:07.564 --> 00:45:09.286]  They did not give up.
[00:45:09.286 --> 00:45:11.407]  They merely moved into the Green Movement.
[00:45:12.088 --> 00:45:20.998]  And you may think, if you're listening to this program, who is this lunatic potty-peer saying these strange, extreme things on the line from England?
[00:45:20.998 --> 00:45:22.680]  Well, get this.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.764]  I spoke to the late Eric Ellington, who was a very good friend of mine.
[00:45:26.764 --> 00:45:28.867]  He was one of the founders of Greenpeace.
[00:45:29.651 --> 00:45:36.055]  Now, here was a guy who genuinely believed that we should leave the planet a better place than we found it.
[00:45:36.055 --> 00:45:41.718]  That we should not pollute it, not destroy it, not rape its resources to a degree that was excessive.
[00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:47.582]  He was a sensible, genuine, kind-hearted, really genuinely green environmentalist.
[00:45:48.062 --> 00:45:58.069]  And he made his living as a landscape photographer going around and photographing the beauties of nature on behalf of those who wished it to be recorded for all time.
[00:45:58.069 --> 00:46:00.130]  He was a genuinely good man.
[00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:10.977]  And he, it was, who told me that he and several of his co-founders of Greenpeace had to leave that movement after a few years because the Marxists had moved in.
[00:46:11.477 --> 00:46:12.379]  We're good to go.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.662]  They began talking the language of environmentalism instead.
[00:46:27.662 --> 00:46:31.983]  It's exactly the same people with exactly the same motives.
[00:46:31.983 --> 00:46:38.326]  It's a kind of hatred of the success and the prosperity and the democracy of the West.
[00:46:38.326 --> 00:46:49.891]  They do not like the idea that we, the people, by our cross on the ballot paper, can decide better than they can how we should be governed.
[00:46:50.709 --> 00:46:56.534]  They hate the very notion that the people know best what is best for the people.
[00:46:56.534 --> 00:47:18.571]  And so what they're doing is that that particular faction, for there are many factions in this game, that particular faction, which is not small, it is not ill-funded, it is powerful, it has lots of money, that faction is trying to drive this scare with the deliberate and increasingly openly stated intention of shutting down the West.
[00:47:19.332 --> 00:47:20.454]  Now, we can do two things.
[00:47:20.454 --> 00:47:28.327]  We can sit there as we sat and watched, mesmerised, while Hitler proposed to shut down the West by his armies marching in.
[00:47:29.176 --> 00:47:52.471]  And we can sit with similarly mesmerized fascination as a different kind of rhetoric, but just as ruthless, says we should not only shut down the rest of the West, but perhaps the more extreme ones say, and you know, and you've quoted them before in saying it, that humanity should be wiped from the face of the Earth, and they're perfectly happy to help it along the way by destroying our energy.
[00:47:52.471 --> 00:47:57.034]  Now imagine the consequences of the policy they are advocating.
[00:47:57.034 --> 00:47:57.414]  Imagine
[00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:07.215]  An elderly lady who has contributed to society all her life, who lives on an upper floor of an apartment block.
[00:48:07.215 --> 00:48:10.576]  She might be 20 or 30 floors above the ground.
[00:48:10.576 --> 00:48:15.978]  How is she going to get there if there is no electricity to turn the wheels of the elevator?
[00:48:17.082 --> 00:48:19.444]  Basic questions like that.
[00:48:19.444 --> 00:48:26.231]  Because our infrastructure... How is anyone going to take an x-ray when the electricity isn't working?
[00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:27.953]  None of this is thought through.
[00:48:27.953 --> 00:48:29.575]  None of it is joined up.
[00:48:29.575 --> 00:48:37.903]  All of it is flagrantly irresponsible, very dangerous, and I'm going to go so far as to say, and I don't think this is unreasonable to say this, it is treasonous.
[00:48:38.323 --> 00:48:39.124]  Well, yes, sir!
[00:48:39.124 --> 00:48:40.785]  In fact, you just stole my thunder!
[00:48:57.819 --> 00:49:08.943]  Look, in the last two years, thousands of prominent people, hundreds of scientists, UN heads, come out and say, we want environmental fascism.
[00:49:08.943 --> 00:49:10.884]  We want a dictatorial world government.
[00:49:10.884 --> 00:49:13.765]  The Financial Times of London Foreign Editor.
[00:49:13.765 --> 00:49:16.046]  We're going to do this for your own good.
[00:49:16.046 --> 00:49:18.407]  We're going to have a global one-child policy.
[00:49:18.407 --> 00:49:20.527]  Ted Turner just said that in Mexico a few months ago.
[00:49:20.527 --> 00:49:21.708]  You were there.
[00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:24.749]  I mean, these people are brazen authoritarians
[00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:34.022]  Saying they're coming for our private property, saying they're coming for our children, saying they're coming for our infrastructure and now they're doing it.
[00:49:34.022 --> 00:49:40.792]  They have declared unmitigated war against us and we're at a handicap because
[00:49:41.232 --> 00:49:43.474]  You're apologizing for telling the truth.
[00:49:43.474 --> 00:49:48.358]  I'm apologizing when words can't describe how maniacal.
[00:49:48.358 --> 00:49:56.124]  I mean, it's like the TV ads they ran in England showing small children not going along with carbon taxes so their teacher murders them.
[00:49:56.124 --> 00:50:04.711]  And I mean, this is a group of miscreant, self-hating, gibbering control freaks that are enemies.
[00:50:04.711 --> 00:50:10.175]  And I can't imagine a jury anywhere that will not convict them for calling for mass murder.
[00:50:10.495 --> 00:50:11.997]  Throw them in prison now!
[00:50:11.997 --> 00:50:13.919]  They're declaring war on us!
[00:50:13.919 --> 00:50:25.852]  Now actually, you raise an interesting point there, because although the right of free speech in the United States is very wide, it does not reach as far as sedition.
[00:50:26.693 --> 00:50:28.934]  And sedition is what they're now preaching.
[00:50:28.934 --> 00:50:49.541]  When they start preaching that children who disagree with the so-called mainstream opinion on climate change should be blown to bits, and you see a picture of the teacher hitting a red button, and then you see the splattered blood of the children falling on the other children, and this is the kind of propaganda that the Green movement now regards as appropriate.
[00:50:50.081 --> 00:51:04.533]  Then this is a wake-up call to the civilized world that the uncivilized, the usual suspect, the, as you call them, the eco-fascists, and I'm afraid that's a sensible name for them, that these people are intent on destruction.
[00:51:04.533 --> 00:51:09.817]  There are two kinds of people in politics, those who wish to build and those who wish to destroy.
[00:51:09.817 --> 00:51:18.204]  And on the hard environmental left, in the traffic light tendency, the green's too yellow to admit they're really red.
[00:51:19.105 --> 00:51:23.968]  These people have absolutely no intention of playing by the Queensbury rules.
[00:51:23.968 --> 00:51:30.133]  They have no intention of following democracy, no intention of living by the ballot box.
[00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:41.160]  That is why, here and in many other areas of life, they are working away to transfer governing power from elected hands
[00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:58.290]  In the individual nation states to unelected hand in supranational organizations whose common defining characteristic is the total absence of any form of democratic control over them or election of their key personnel.
[00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:22.407]  And just to be clear, Lord Monckton, on record, we've never called for their investigation and arrest until they began, like a group of blackbirds in a tree, you know, sing to the same tune, to have us arrested, to have us killed, to have one-child policies, to put in prison or execute climate change deniers.
[00:52:22.407 --> 00:52:25.290]  They are openly calling for an authoritarian
[00:52:26.497 --> 00:52:29.298]  Nightmare Planet run by them.
[00:52:29.298 --> 00:52:32.698]  They have made the declarations of tyranny.
[00:52:32.698 --> 00:52:38.379]  And if I announced that I wanted to rob and kill my neighbor and that I was going to do it, the police would come arrest me.
[00:52:38.379 --> 00:52:41.480]  Why are they allowed to get away with this?
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.880]  I think I'm answering my own question.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.360]  Why do they come out with such outrageous statements?
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:54.242]  Are they trying to condition us to the extreme ideas so that they can then have the moral high ground in their minds to start actually carrying this out?
[00:52:54.722 --> 00:52:58.324]  What they're doing is, it's a well-known political technique.
[00:52:58.324 --> 00:53:00.284]  They're pushing the envelope.
[00:53:00.284 --> 00:53:04.326]  They're seeing how far they can push before we push back.
[00:53:04.326 --> 00:53:08.208]  And if we don't push back, they go on pushing forward.
[00:53:08.208 --> 00:53:10.269]  Now, the question is, how to push back?
[00:53:11.597 --> 00:53:24.165]  And I think there are various ways that those who are listening to this program, who may think that it all sounds terribly extreme, can, in fact, reassure themselves that what we're saying is not, in fact, extreme at all.
[00:53:24.165 --> 00:53:26.346]  It is the solid truth.
[00:53:26.346 --> 00:53:39.714]  There's plenty of evidence at scienceandpublicpolicy.org of what these people are up to, how they tried to bend the science of climate in the ClimateGate emails, which revealed a great deal of the methods they were using.
[00:53:40.374 --> 00:54:03.332]  How they are trying to distort the economic case, how they're trying to capture politics, and how they are trying, very furtively, to transfer power via things like the Cancun Agreement to the hundreds of interlocking new UN-sponsored bureaucracies that will be answerable to the Secretariat of the states parties, to the
[00:54:04.453 --> 00:54:10.999]  And by the way, that UN program talks about relocation of populations because of their carbon footprint.
[00:54:10.999 --> 00:54:19.326]  You also see Obama ignoring the Congress and using the unelected bureaucracy to shut down power plants.
[00:54:19.326 --> 00:54:29.735]  In closing, Lord Monckton, as you know, it's come out in the last few days that the NPR officers compared deniers of climate change to birthers and flat-earth believers.
[00:54:30.376 --> 00:54:35.019]  Well, I think it's time we started taking them to court for the criminal offense of sedition.
[00:54:48.414 --> 00:54:50.296]  Because that's what it is.
[00:54:50.296 --> 00:54:52.438]  They've pushed too far.
[00:54:52.438 --> 00:55:03.547]  And where you can go to these meetings, where they speak, where you can record those videos, just send them in to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:55:03.547 --> 00:55:13.616]  There the team will look at them and they will then pass on to me the more interesting ones where these people speak out and say things they shouldn't and openly preach sedition.
[00:55:14.296 --> 00:55:25.727]  I am in touch with various legal foundations in the States who can help to bring these people to trial for the criminal offence of sedition against the people of the United States.
[00:55:25.727 --> 00:55:36.617]  And all it takes is one or two of these to be brought up in front of a jury who hears what they've been saying, looks at the videos they've been producing of children being blown up,
[00:55:37.337 --> 00:55:43.959]  And then find them guilty of sedition and send them away to prison for a few years to think about their folly.
[00:55:43.959 --> 00:55:49.420]  And all the rest of these cowards will run for cover and the scare will be over.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:55.541]  So you can help by filming these people as they make these extreme remarks.
[00:55:55.541 --> 00:55:59.302]  Film carefully so they don't see you filming or they'll destroy your film.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.183]  Get it out, get it to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:03.183 --> 00:56:11.870]  They will pass it to me, I will pass it to the lawyers, and we will start prosecuting these people until America is free once again.
[00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:18.216]  Absolutely, because, I mean, they are calling for ending the democratic process, they are calling for our arrest.
[00:56:18.216 --> 00:56:20.037]  We're not the ones drawing first blood.
[00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:26.423]  We're saying when you say overthrow a system of government, arrest people you don't agree with, one-child policies,
[00:56:26.923 --> 00:56:30.944]  You know, when you take a country over, you blow up their power plants first when you invade.
[00:56:30.944 --> 00:56:33.585]  They're destroying our power system.
[00:56:33.585 --> 00:56:35.106]  This is warfare.
[00:56:35.106 --> 00:56:41.328]  And these are the most sickening, self-hating, loathing control freaks you can imagine.
[00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:42.308]  They must be met.
[00:56:42.308 --> 00:56:43.389]  They must be defeated.
[00:56:43.389 --> 00:56:45.669]  They want their organized planned economy.
[00:56:45.669 --> 00:56:47.490]  And they've got to destroy our infrastructure to do it.
[00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:50.934]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[00:56:50.934 --> 00:56:52.997]  Lord Christopher Monckton, thank you for joining us.
[00:56:52.997 --> 00:56:55.981]  I look forward to having you up in the near future.
[00:56:55.981 --> 00:56:57.262]  You've got one minute left.
[00:56:57.262 --> 00:56:58.083]  Closing comments.
[00:56:58.772 --> 00:57:01.834]  Right, as I've said, you know where to send the tapes.
[00:57:01.834 --> 00:57:05.356]  Film these people when they make these speeches.
[00:57:05.356 --> 00:57:10.939]  If you see cuttings of them reported in the newspapers, send them in to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:10.939 --> 00:57:13.440]  We're going to start a file on these people.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:24.086]  Once there is enough material, we will then move to prosecute them because the correct way to deal with them is not violence, it's not killing, it is prosecution.
[00:57:24.606 --> 00:57:28.928]  In the courts of law, that's how your Constitution said it should be done.
[00:57:28.928 --> 00:57:36.371]  And it's that Constitution, and the freedom and democracy that it guarantees, that we are all sworn to defend.
[00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:42.054]  That's what we're going to try to do, to keep democracy alive despite what these people are trying to do.
[00:57:42.054 --> 00:57:45.816]  So God bless you all, God bless you Alex, and God bless America.
[00:57:45.816 --> 00:57:49.377]  Absolutely, they are avowed authoritarians, they must be met head on.
[00:57:49.377 --> 00:57:50.738]  Thank you sir for joining us, take care.
[00:57:52.176 --> 00:57:53.076]  All right, there he goes.
[00:57:53.076 --> 00:57:55.557]  Yeah, these people are tyrants.
[00:57:55.557 --> 00:58:00.479]  They are miscreant eugenicists that want forced population reduction.
[00:58:00.479 --> 00:58:05.121]  And the White House regulations are, calls for my arrest for 9-11 truth.
[00:58:05.121 --> 00:58:08.662]  He calls for the arrest of people who don't believe in man-made global warming.
[00:58:09.122 --> 00:58:22.169]  It'd be one thing if they wanted to shoot their mouths off, but when they start calling for us to be arrested, and they've got government power, and then they're talking about how they want to kill 80% of the world population, these people are 21st century Nazis.
[00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:23.050]  Figure it out!
[00:58:24.295 --> 00:58:26.916]  Figure out most of you liberals out there aren't liberals at all.
[00:58:26.916 --> 00:58:28.676]  You're into a eugenics code.
[00:58:28.676 --> 00:58:29.957]  You love abortion.
[00:58:29.957 --> 00:58:31.597]  You love it all.
[00:58:31.597 --> 00:58:38.159]  Dr. Nick Begich getting into the biggest threat of all, electronic psychotronic mind control, is going to be joining us coming up.
[00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:44.201]  Stay with us.
[00:58:44.201 --> 00:58:48.162]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.832 --> 00:58:58.858]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:58:58.858 --> 00:59:01.540]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:12.108]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs, food
[00:59:12.168 --> 00:59:12.628]  We're good to go.
[00:59:37.722 --> 00:59:38.723]  800-409-5633.
[00:59:38.723 --> 00:59:43.987]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:59:43.987 --> 00:59:53.474]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:59:53.474 --> 00:59:55.876]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.876 --> 00:59:58.618]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:10.078]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:11.659]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.659 --> 01:00:13.199]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.199 --> 01:00:17.381]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:21.642]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.642 --> 01:00:26.784]  We're already into hour number two.
[01:00:26.784 --> 01:00:29.826]  You will want to join me in hour number three.
[01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.667]  We're going to play the Michael Moore clip saying that
[01:00:34.011 --> 01:00:41.293]  Your money, anybody's money out there, is a natural, national resource owned by the government.
[01:00:41.293 --> 01:00:43.194]  That's who will distribute it to themselves.
[01:00:43.194 --> 01:00:48.036]  The fools in the streets will only get small, paltry, chicken-feet amounts of it.
[01:00:48.036 --> 01:00:49.696]  But it's more sophisticated than that.
[01:00:49.696 --> 01:00:55.358]  The big banksters that Michael Moore pointed out that have been robbing us are robbing us.
[01:00:55.358 --> 01:01:00.980]  And he says, well, there's 400 people that have as much wealth as half the rest of the other country.
[01:01:02.851 --> 01:01:06.913]  400 people have as much wealth as 50% of the people.
[01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:22.499]  But he's not telling you that the other group in there, from that 50% up to that one half of 1%, has more wealth than those other groups together.
[01:01:22.499 --> 01:01:24.620]  It's that big, fat, middle class there.
[01:01:25.421 --> 01:01:27.203]  That's really being targeted by the banksters.
[01:01:27.203 --> 01:01:47.480]  The banksters destroy the economy by design, they bring in the crisis, they offer the solution with the government employees and people on government contracts, and then they come in and rob what's left of the middle class and transfer most of it offshore but give chicken feed to their own minions.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.565]  That's what Michael Moore isn't explaining and I'm gonna go over it all in detail in the next hour after Dr. Nick Baggage leaves us.
[01:02:00.552 --> 01:02:09.154]  In other news here today, boy I tell ya, we're gonna have to get Lindsey Williams back on this week.
[01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:17.337]  Because, I know Jaren gets excited to hear that, he loves Lindsey.
[01:02:17.337 --> 01:02:20.738]  You ever heard of Lindsey Williams when we got him on the Opie and Anthony show?
[01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:21.958]  Now that was entertaining.
[01:02:23.067 --> 01:02:24.948]  But seriously, it's the information he has.
[01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:26.649]  A little bit of gallus humor there.
[01:02:26.649 --> 01:02:34.893]  Saudi Arabia's Day of Rage lures record bets on $200 oil chart of the day.
[01:02:34.893 --> 01:02:48.699]  And Bloomberg is reporting that June delivery is now looking like it could be $200 a barrel.
[01:02:50.305 --> 01:02:54.247]  So we're going to be breaking that down as well coming up the third hour.
[01:02:54.247 --> 01:02:55.287]  Man, I wish we were wrong.
[01:02:55.287 --> 01:02:59.189]  We just keep being right over and over again.
[01:02:59.189 --> 01:03:03.611]  Wait till I cover the checkmate, the super endgame.
[01:03:03.611 --> 01:03:04.491]  Why the globalists?
[01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:07.073]  One reason they're so arrogant in the next segment.
[01:03:07.073 --> 01:03:08.753]  Mind control through the television.
[01:03:08.753 --> 01:03:11.535]  And not the old-fashioned ways they've been mind controlling.
[01:03:11.535 --> 01:03:14.276]  With the propaganda and the disinfo.
[01:03:14.276 --> 01:03:14.376]  No.
[01:03:15.435 --> 01:03:23.520]  Through the wavelengths itself, through the electromagnetic energy, through your eyes, programming the brain that way.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:34.047]  But options traders are betting, more than ever, that crude oil is heading to $200 a barrel, as some websites call for the day of rage in Saudi Arabia and anti-government protests spread in the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:03:34.047 --> 01:03:39.551]  Remember he kept saying that they were going to overthrow Saudi Arabia, or try, and that oil production will be cut.
[01:03:40.418 --> 01:03:44.000]  And they said it isn't war coming in the Middle East, it's upheaval, it's turmoil.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.101]  That was in October.
[01:03:45.101 --> 01:03:48.983]  In fact, we ought to go back to that October interview with Williams.
[01:03:48.983 --> 01:03:52.505]  We need some interns for it, but we could do it too.
[01:03:52.505 --> 01:04:00.349]  Or listeners out there ought to go into that October interview and excise out the clips and say, Lindsey Williams predicts in October what's now happening.
[01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:01.330]  We could post it.
[01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.411]  We just don't have the... He's on record, though.
[01:04:03.411 --> 01:04:05.612]  We wrote articles about it at the time.
[01:04:05.612 --> 01:04:08.834]  That stuff's all up on the Alex Jones Channel at YouTube and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:09.963 --> 01:04:13.384]  It's all there.
[01:04:13.384 --> 01:04:20.427]  I'm going to cover that, too, next hour, because we've also got this headline, Forbes, will oil spike lead to QE3?
[01:04:20.427 --> 01:04:23.088]  That's more global dollar devaluation.
[01:04:23.088 --> 01:04:24.949]  This has all been engineered.
[01:04:24.949 --> 01:04:30.372]  And you get folks up here, Lord love them, like Max Keiser and others, who go, well, I've been in the streets.
[01:04:30.372 --> 01:04:32.232]  The people really don't like their government.
[01:04:32.232 --> 01:04:33.553]  Yeah, Max, we understand that.
[01:04:34.465 --> 01:04:35.286]  We understand that.
[01:04:35.286 --> 01:04:38.428]  We understand they're mad, and that that part of the revolution is real.
[01:04:38.428 --> 01:04:41.390]  There's a bigger picture here, okay?
[01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:46.194]  And it's engineered, okay?
[01:04:46.194 --> 01:04:55.801]  What that former head of one of the big three oil companies told Lindsey Williams, and I know the guy's name, what he told him four and a half months ago is happening to the latter!
[01:04:55.801 --> 01:04:57.122]  Ignore it at your own risk!
[01:04:57.122 --> 01:04:58.864]  Dr. Nick Begich coming up with the key intel.
[01:05:04.798 --> 01:05:06.059]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.059 --> 01:05:09.983]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.983 --> 01:05:12.225]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.225 --> 01:05:18.091]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:24.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.757 --> 01:05:30.701]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:34.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.904 --> 01:05:39.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.207 --> 01:05:45.152]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.152 --> 01:05:48.714]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.714 --> 01:05:50.675]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.675 --> 01:05:51.116]  It's here.

[01:06:08.513 --> 01:06:13.655]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:06:13.655 --> 01:06:19.158]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:06:19.158 --> 01:06:26.101]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:34.465]  I'm looking for America.
[01:06:34.465 --> 01:06:36.086]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:06:36.086 --> 01:06:38.887]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:06:38.887 --> 01:06:43.329]  Land I left free in my home of the brave.
[01:06:43.329 --> 01:06:47.031]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:06:54.821 --> 01:07:00.088]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:07:00.088 --> 01:07:04.633]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[01:07:04.633 --> 01:07:08.979]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.979 --> 01:07:10.901]  Number two, our new energy czar.
[01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:15.465]  It's true.
[01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:21.170]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:24.753]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:29.457]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.457 --> 01:07:32.219]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:35.582]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.882 --> 01:07:40.824]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:45.885]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.885 --> 01:07:50.047]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:50.047 --> 01:07:51.847]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.847 --> 01:07:56.429]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:06.063]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.063 --> 01:08:08.345]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:30.566]  We're going to Dr. Nick Magich with about as important an information as you can cover.
[01:08:31.887 --> 01:08:36.389]  This information is about as important as it can get.
[01:08:36.389 --> 01:08:37.930]  Dealing with mind control.
[01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:40.311]  So we're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:51.256]  Speaking of Dr. Nick Baggage, even when he's on with us, I don't even plug the fact that we carry all of his books and videos at discounted prices at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:57.699]  Not only do you get important information, but your purchase of the books, the videos, the materials also supports the different
[01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:01.442]  Researchers that are out there and InfoWars.com.
[01:09:01.442 --> 01:09:10.908]  Angels Don't Play This Harp, Advances in Tesla Technology, Dr. Nick Begich, excellent book, updated.
[01:09:10.908 --> 01:09:16.893]  Controlling the Human Mind, the Technologies of Political Control or Tools for Peak Performance.
[01:09:16.893 --> 01:09:18.634]  It's a double-edged sword.
[01:09:18.634 --> 01:09:23.077]  The globalists want to use it to actually reduce performance because they're threatened by free humanity.
[01:09:23.077 --> 01:09:25.439]  That's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:26.019 --> 01:09:31.502]  Harp, the update, Angels Still Don't Play This Harp, great documentary DVD.
[01:09:31.502 --> 01:09:37.246]  And Mind Control, A Brave New World or Enhancing Human Performance, that on DVD as well.
[01:09:37.246 --> 01:09:41.608]  So basically film versions but updated of those two books.
[01:09:41.608 --> 01:09:46.051]  All very scholarly, very well footnoted and documented.
[01:09:46.051 --> 01:09:47.972]  In Your Face with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:09:47.972 --> 01:09:50.414]  All of that available at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:50.414 --> 01:09:53.656]  Also a great new film by G. Edward Griffin.
[01:09:54.196 --> 01:09:55.896]  And that's What in the World Are They Spraying?
[01:09:55.896 --> 01:09:59.237]  This is available at Infowars.com right now.
[01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:06.079]  The new book that you can only get at Infowars.com, Big Brother, They Were Welling in Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:10:06.079 --> 01:10:08.299]  It starts shipping, what, in 12 days.
[01:10:08.299 --> 01:10:15.881]  So if you wanna be the first to get Big Brother, They Were Welling in Nightmare Come True and support folks like Mark Dice and independent researchers.
[01:10:15.881 --> 01:10:18.541]  Maybe you already know all about the Big Brother control grid.
[01:10:18.541 --> 01:10:21.682]  You probably will learn some stuff, but your friends and family and neighbors
[01:10:22.362 --> 01:10:29.729]  It's a good chance we'll read something with a handsome cover like this that has a good boil down on the back and then you can wake them up.
[01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:31.770]  Knowing this information is only the beginning.
[01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.192]  You've got to pass it on.
[01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:36.375]  You've got to have that burning desire to get the job done.
[01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:45.623]  Also, the secret of Oz, solutions for a broken economy, dealing with the banksters and what they've engineered in our society and solutions to counter it.
[01:10:45.623 --> 01:10:47.825]  All those poor union people up there protesting?
[01:10:48.385 --> 01:10:49.726]  They have no idea what's happening.
[01:10:49.726 --> 01:10:51.007]  This is austerity.
[01:10:51.007 --> 01:10:53.649]  This is where everything is cut to pay it to the bankers.
[01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:57.171]  The Republicans up there, they have no idea what's happening.
[01:10:57.171 --> 01:11:03.996]  We're going to explain that coming up in the third hour today, how they need to shift their paradigm and see the big picture.
[01:11:03.996 --> 01:11:05.077]  So that is coming up.
[01:11:05.077 --> 01:11:09.901]  But again, The Secrets of Oz available at Infowars.com and then other great films.
[01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:26.381]  That we carry and that we've also produced films, of course, like Invisible Empire, A New World Order, Defined, Fall of the Republic, The Obama Deception, Endgame, Terror Storm, all available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:11:26.381 --> 01:11:27.721]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:28.541]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:40.272]  Or excuse me, a seven, eight, seven, six, zero.
[01:11:40.272 --> 01:11:41.614]  That is correct.
[01:11:41.614 --> 01:11:45.257]  Okay.
[01:11:45.257 --> 01:11:58.390]  Let me just kind of reset here for a moment because when I get into a subject this big and this important, I really want to be on, I really want to be focused, and I want people to understand this is not hyperbole.
[01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.651]  Okay?
[01:12:00.322 --> 01:12:16.759]  Just like 15 years ago, I was sent secret documents from a nurse in San Antonio about all babies at birth having their blood taken and put in a secret global database for bioweapons development, drug development, you name it.
[01:12:18.035 --> 01:12:20.597]  Race-specific bioweapon development.
[01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:29.124]  And I covered these secret documents on air, and then families began to sue in the last decade, and won suits in Minnesota, Texas, and other areas.
[01:12:29.124 --> 01:12:31.946]  Every time I did research, it was my listeners suing.
[01:12:31.946 --> 01:12:38.352]  Because they'd go to the hospital, they'd watch them take the blood, they'd tell them no, they'd still do it, and they caught them.
[01:12:38.352 --> 01:12:44.897]  Now it's admitted, secret global database upkept by the Pentagon and the U.S., race-specific bioweapon research, you name it.
[01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.337]  People couldn't believe me for 15 years, even though I had the documents.
[01:12:49.337 --> 01:12:51.658]  It's kind of like 1996.
[01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:55.300]  The Telecommunications Act said all cell phones will be tracked in real time.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.242]  The government can dial in and listen to you without your phone even being on.
[01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:04.024]  This was under federal law for the regulations.
[01:13:04.024 --> 01:13:05.244]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:13:05.244 --> 01:13:06.685]  People go, oh yeah, everybody knows that.
[01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:10.946]  They don't want you knowing about this until it's already in place.
[01:13:10.946 --> 01:13:15.756]  Now, Dr. Nick Magich was on with us a few months ago, and he said,
[01:13:18.547 --> 01:13:27.853]  He said, you're focusing so much on sodium fluoride, which lowers IQ and causes degeneration of the bones and causes lowering IQ.
[01:13:27.853 --> 01:13:29.034]  Sure, that's important.
[01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:31.756]  You're focusing on mercury, lead, things like that.
[01:13:31.756 --> 01:13:41.802]  He said, the real issue is, and what I see most of the globalist interest is in, is psychotronic, electronic, wavelengths, light.
[01:13:44.955 --> 01:13:53.337]  Since I had him on, and I've done a lot of research on it as well, and we're gonna go to the doctor here in a moment, I've seen all these mainstream news articles about U.S.
[01:13:53.337 --> 01:14:00.918]  patent 6506148, nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields for monitors.
[01:14:00.918 --> 01:14:03.619]  We know there's the propaganda on TV.
[01:14:03.619 --> 01:14:07.880]  We know that there's the flicker rate that puts you in a dream state, highly suggestible.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.360]  But this is more than that.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.101]  And literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of patents
[01:14:13.121 --> 01:14:21.270]  Dealing with this in DARPA, in the mainstream news, in the Baltimore Sun saying, oh, we're testing towers to calm you during emergencies.
[01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.652]  So there's this coming out of this.
[01:14:23.652 --> 01:14:26.916]  Ceiling lights in Minnesota send coded internet data.
[01:14:26.916 --> 01:14:27.797]  Flicker rate.
[01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.300]  Well, your eyes are just like an infrared collector.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.621]  In fact, they pick up part of that spectrum.
[01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:34.742]  It can program the brain.
[01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:40.646]  The data down power lines, which they now admit will control your thermostat, your refrigerator.
[01:14:40.646 --> 01:14:42.527]  They're invading through everything.
[01:14:42.527 --> 01:14:44.888]  They're way ahead of us technologically.
[01:14:44.888 --> 01:14:48.270]  This is why they're so arrogant in reading these patents.
[01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:57.456]  It says they can physiologically change you, including hurting you, potentially triggering heart attacks, you name it, through the television.
[01:14:58.587 --> 01:15:10.710]  So, the point is, we're going to look at the systems that can be used to attack us with Dr. Nick Begich of EarthPulse.com, the eldest son of the late United States Congressman from Alaska, Nick Begich Sr.
[01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:15.112]  If I go over Dr. Begich's whole bio, we'll be here for hours.
[01:15:15.112 --> 01:15:16.052]  His brother is a U.S.
[01:15:16.052 --> 01:15:21.693]  Senator, obviously Senator Begich, but he's really a leading expert.
[01:15:21.693 --> 01:15:24.914]  He's been an expert speaker before the EU Parliament.
[01:15:24.914 --> 01:15:25.975]  The list goes on and on.
[01:15:28.533 --> 01:15:30.394]  Let me just shift gears down to Dr. Bagich.
[01:15:30.394 --> 01:15:35.117]  I did that long intro so folks could know where we're going with this.
[01:15:35.117 --> 01:15:36.698]  And I understand you don't want to scare people.
[01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.460]  You want to empower them with this info.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:42.522]  But if people aren't even aware of it, I don't even see it as scaring.
[01:15:42.522 --> 01:15:46.145]  If I can tell somebody, hey, don't jump off that cliff, you might get hurt.
[01:15:46.145 --> 01:15:47.326]  That's not fear.
[01:15:47.326 --> 01:15:48.767]  I'm telling them what's happening.
[01:15:48.767 --> 01:15:50.428]  I want folks to become aware of this.
[01:15:50.428 --> 01:15:57.172]  And your deep research into the patents and things that we know are clearly being covertly rolled out and tested.
[01:15:57.172 --> 01:15:58.413]  Dr. Bagich, thank you for joining us.
[01:15:58.593 --> 01:16:00.056]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:01.098]  It's always great to be with you.
[01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:06.567]  You know that patent that you just cited, and it came out of a recent press report.
[01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:09.472]  Actually, I quoted the exact same patent back in 2006 in the book.
[01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:23.181]  Controlling the human mind, and it's our footnote number 86, and it's actually clustered around a whole series of patents that deal with this same situation.
[01:16:23.181 --> 01:16:31.086]  Let me just read some of the names of the patents, which make sense for folks, and we'll actually draw out some of the information.
[01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:36.350]  One of them is a human auditory system responses to modulated electromagnetic fields.
[01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:44.133]  We have another one that's listed that's an apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brainwaves.
[01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:49.135]  Another one, a multi-channel brain signal amplifying and digitizing system.
[01:16:49.135 --> 01:16:54.877]  So that you could actually pick a signal out and transfer it through a computer system.
[01:16:54.877 --> 01:17:00.339]  But there's a series of, there's dozens of them quoted in that book and footnoted there.
[01:17:00.339 --> 01:17:02.860]  And the reason we wrote this was
[01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:08.657]  This we consider to be the most significant issue facing the 21st century.
[01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:21.214]  I mean, when you think about whether it's light emitted from a television set by modulating or pulsing that light in a very specific way, you can create all kinds of physiological coupling.
[01:17:21.835 --> 01:17:37.834]  Not just with the nervous system but then affecting the entire system whether you're targeting the brain or just creating a situation of hyper relaxation so that when the normal propaganda through advertising or news reports or what-have-you
[01:17:38.914 --> 01:17:42.757]  It actually integrates at a much, much deeper level than most people realize.
[01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:48.700]  Think about your wife hollering at you when you're watching a television show and you're totally oblivious.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:54.703]  Or you're talking to your kids and they absolutely do not register in their consciousness anything you're saying.
[01:17:54.703 --> 01:18:01.367]  They're actually in a very light, trance-like state and they are literally not watching the program.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.981]  They are the program.
[01:18:03.981 --> 01:18:07.203]  And that's the important direction in which technology has changed.
[01:18:07.203 --> 01:18:10.305]  There's another article that we quote from the U.S.
[01:18:10.305 --> 01:18:14.008]  Army War College, and it's in their quarterly called Perimeters.
[01:18:14.008 --> 01:18:20.672]  The article was called, The Mind Has No Firewalls, and it was written back in the late 90s.
[01:18:20.672 --> 01:18:29.618]  But we quote that frequently because what it says is that any electromagnetic carrier, whether it's the radio or TV networks or
[01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:44.899]  Even the electromagnetic grid that surrounds all of us or cell phone towers or any of these things can carry a signal, can modulate a sort of a secondary signal that the body will recognize or the mind will recognize depending on how that's tuned.
[01:18:46.098 --> 01:18:59.709]  Think of the human body as a very, very finely engineered electromagnetic circuit that can be manipulated in the same way as other less sophisticated man-made electromagnetic circuits.
[01:18:59.709 --> 01:19:10.878]  And the difference is, our level of knowledge and technology is allowing us to couple with the human body in a much, much different way and a much higher resolution.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.164]  We're much more as possible, and that's why this is such a critical issue.
[01:19:16.164 --> 01:19:26.834]  Not from the standpoint of fear, but if we don't have knowledge, when we start to see the effects of this, and I think we already are in many, many ways, it won't be understandable.
[01:19:26.834 --> 01:19:28.175]  It won't make sense.
[01:19:28.175 --> 01:19:30.918]  But in the context of technology, it all makes sense.
[01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:35.777]  Well look, 20 years ago I'd go out to the countryside and wouldn't feel relieved.
[01:19:35.777 --> 01:19:40.861]  When I get away from cell phones and get out in the middle of nowhere, I feel like a human being again.
[01:19:40.861 --> 01:19:45.004]  And there's no doubt, I have the documents, they're testing all of this on us.
[01:19:45.004 --> 01:19:55.471]  And now under the cybersecurity, Homeland Security takeover of all telecommunications, they're putting their equipment in to push carrier waves over the top of it.
[01:19:55.471 --> 01:19:56.932]  And that's why they're so arrogant.
[01:19:56.932 --> 01:19:59.654]  The general public is in a mind control trance right now.
[01:20:00.014 --> 01:20:00.754]  We're trying to break you out.
[01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:07.316]  Don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation, bankrupted or being sued?
[01:20:07.316 --> 01:20:13.118]  Zero Debt has a program that stops foreclosure, guaranteed for at least two years, without payments or attorneys.
[01:20:13.118 --> 01:20:18.759]  In fact, we show our members how to get the banks to pay their taxes and insurance while they stonewall the bank's collection process.
[01:20:18.759 --> 01:20:23.541]  We show you how it's possible to quiet the title in your name by using the bank's very own foreclosure process.
[01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:25.101]  Loan modification is a joke.
[01:20:25.101 --> 01:20:28.702]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.
[01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:30.083]  You've heard our ad before.
[01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:32.905]  We are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.
[01:20:32.905 --> 01:20:36.347]  We are a group of people just like you that are sick and tired of the housing crash.
[01:20:36.347 --> 01:20:39.589]  And we've helped thousands avoid foreclosure since 1993.

[01:20:52.156 --> 01:20:53.216]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[01:21:01.804 --> 01:21:05.808]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.808 --> 01:21:09.071]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.071 --> 01:21:13.875]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:20.241]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.241 --> 01:21:22.484]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:21:23.024 --> 01:21:23.324]  Tim Geithner?
[01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:23.584]  Bernanke?
[01:21:23.584 --> 01:21:24.165]  They're arsonists!
[01:21:24.165 --> 01:21:25.165]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:25.165 --> 01:21:27.286]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:41.932 --> 01:21:44.054]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.054 --> 01:21:49.198]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:21:49.198 --> 01:21:58.385]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:00.026 --> 01:22:02.989]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:02.989 --> 01:22:07.153]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:22:07.153 --> 01:22:09.415]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:09.415 --> 01:22:14.580]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.402]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:16.402 --> 01:22:17.943]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:17.943 --> 01:22:19.425]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:19.425 --> 01:22:22.488]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:22.788 --> 01:22:28.150]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:37.514]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing co-benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:22:37.514 --> 01:22:39.855]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.576]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:22:45.998 --> 01:22:46.218]  Call 800-686-2237
[01:22:59.577 --> 01:23:02.539]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.

[01:24:31.863 --> 01:24:34.325]  Okay, Dr. Nick Begich is our guest.
[01:24:34.325 --> 01:24:40.868]  Dr. Begich, they have the EAS emergency alert system over all radio and TV.
[01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:51.755]  The President's announced he's going to start making announcements on those, announcements on 9,000 telescreens at the Walmarts and other locations, where you've got to look at the message when you're in the checkout line.
[01:24:51.755 --> 01:24:53.896]  You've got to look at the jumbotron.
[01:24:53.896 --> 01:24:56.058]  And the studies show that now, within seconds,
[01:24:57.048 --> 01:25:01.490]  You can become mesmerized by TV with these messages.
[01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:07.612]  The whole world is being turned basically into a Times Square system.
[01:25:07.612 --> 01:25:09.953]  The license plates are going to switch to digital.
[01:25:09.953 --> 01:25:12.414]  California is announcing with messages there.
[01:25:12.414 --> 01:25:13.875]  Little TV screens.
[01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:18.656]  You can see this control grid they're putting in and reading these patents.
[01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:19.777]  They cannot just make you
[01:25:20.437 --> 01:25:23.961]  They can actually modify signals to target any system of the body, not just the brain.
[01:25:23.961 --> 01:25:25.743]  They can target any of the vital organs.
[01:25:43.079 --> 01:25:58.785]  Using modulated signals they can attack specific cells, you know, in particular trigger certain effects elementally within the body that can cause overloading, cause the body to malfunction and essentially shut down.
[01:25:59.005 --> 01:26:02.608]  Cell phones, they admit, increase brain activity now.
[01:26:02.608 --> 01:26:03.228]  Right, right.
[01:26:03.228 --> 01:26:24.762]  You know, this is, again, any physiological effect, FDA is supposed to be controlling that, and here, finally, after, what, a decade or more, I think we published our first article on cell phones in Explorer Magazine back in 1998, and never changed our opinion, and quite frankly, time has proven, when you look at our work over the last 15 years,
[01:26:25.991 --> 01:26:32.234]  Everything we suggested has come to pass in terms of how the technology evolved and how it would be used against us.
[01:26:32.234 --> 01:26:39.178]  This area in particular, in fact the military air force research lab refers to this whole area as controlled effects.
[01:26:39.178 --> 01:26:47.102]  The idea of being able to overload all of the sensory systems so that you can create complete sort of holographic experiences.
[01:26:47.102 --> 01:26:52.764]  That's the target of that article and it was the front page story in Technology Horizons back in June of 2004.
[01:26:54.205 --> 01:26:57.786]  And it was by the Electromagnetic Directorate of the Air Force.
[01:26:57.786 --> 01:27:01.367]  Most folks don't even know there is such an organization.
[01:27:01.367 --> 01:27:06.989]  And as you've noticed, because you say, look, chemicals are important, but Alex, most of the funding is the electromagnetic.
[01:27:06.989 --> 01:27:09.029]  This, we don't know all the secrets.
[01:27:09.029 --> 01:27:12.250]  We know enough, but we know they're spending the big money on this.
[01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:12.530]  Right.
[01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:14.010]  Well, actually, there's quite a bit.
[01:27:14.010 --> 01:27:15.831]  You know, we had, I posted
[01:27:16.963 --> 01:27:25.606]  On our website a number of DARPA overheads that they used in some various presentations on creating interactions and coupling with the human nervous system.
[01:27:25.606 --> 01:27:30.147]  The very stuff of the article that you just quoted in the patent you quoted earlier.
[01:27:30.147 --> 01:27:33.308]  And this stuff put out by DARPA I think goes back to 2002-2003 vintage.
[01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:40.390]  Yeah, I remember them in the Baltimore Sun saying, we're testing towers in Baltimore.
[01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:42.931]  It's no big deal to calm you in emergencies.
[01:27:42.931 --> 01:27:43.371]  Right.
[01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:50.653]  Now remember, it was just a few weeks ago, there was another article that was even, I think, more important in this sense.
[01:27:50.653 --> 01:27:56.075]  It talked about our PSYOP operatives in Afghanistan targeting U.S.
[01:27:56.075 --> 01:28:03.417]  Congressional people that were out there touring the battlefield to get them to be more convinced that larger troops were
[01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.583]  Allocations were needed and so on.
[01:28:06.583 --> 01:28:11.778]  Well, they didn't describe exactly what they used, but this technology literally getting it in their head.
[01:28:12.415 --> 01:28:13.616]  Yeah, that's the key here.
[01:28:13.616 --> 01:28:16.697]  Governments are obsessed with this because they know how important it is.
[01:28:36.087 --> 01:28:37.768]  Right, and it's not just our government.
[01:28:37.768 --> 01:28:53.835]  I mean, the Chinese have spent just as much money when you consider purchasing power, maybe more than we have, because, you know, people forget that they all, everyone laughs about, oh, the Chinese don't spend any money on this stuff, 60 billion a year, 70 billion a year in military, what's that?
[01:28:53.835 --> 01:29:00.178]  Well, go see what you buy for that kind of money in China for two bucks an hour and a bowl of rice.
[01:29:00.178 --> 01:29:04.220]  Well, they don't have as much fraud either because they have a ruling class that already runs it all.
[01:29:04.676 --> 01:29:14.579]  Well, that's true, and the solution, you know, for them is about 15 cents, I think, in the equivalent, you know, and it's the bullet behind the back of the head.
[01:29:14.579 --> 01:29:23.901]  But the point of the matter is, these technologies are not that complicated, so much so that other sophisticated societies can't create them.
[01:29:23.901 --> 01:29:32.784]  In fact, when you look at centralized societies like China, which takes its brightest and smartest and allocates them into these kinds of projects, that's where the danger
[01:29:32.904 --> 01:29:42.873]  Well, it's the danger of the military-industrial complex and its undue dangerous influence, and Eisenhower went on to say, run by a technocratic elite.
[01:29:42.873 --> 01:29:44.494]  A technological technocratic elite.
[01:29:44.494 --> 01:29:46.776]  Stay there, Dr. Nick Beggars, long segment coming up.
[01:29:46.776 --> 01:29:51.080]  Let's keep rolling with this and how we counter it.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.481]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.481 --> 01:29:55.003]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.003 --> 01:29:57.706]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.879 --> 01:30:02.521]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:31:01.784 --> 01:31:05.808]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.808 --> 01:31:09.052]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.052 --> 01:31:13.837]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.837 --> 01:31:20.244]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.244 --> 01:31:22.487]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:23.007 --> 01:31:23.307]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.307 --> 01:31:23.827]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.827 --> 01:31:24.628]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.628 --> 01:31:25.768]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.768 --> 01:31:28.009]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.914 --> 01:31:49.204]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.204 --> 01:31:58.315]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:01.733 --> 01:32:08.758]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:32:08.758 --> 01:32:11.440]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:20.466]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:32:20.466 --> 01:32:28.732]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:32:28.732 --> 01:32:29.252]  Move quickly!
[01:32:29.292 --> 01:32:29.672]  We're good to go.
[01:33:15.615 --> 01:33:17.796]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest.
[01:33:17.796 --> 01:33:26.239]  I hope you're listening to us very carefully because there are thousands and thousands and thousands of patents dealing with electromagnetic mind control.
[01:33:26.239 --> 01:33:29.401]  I have personally only had time to read hundreds.
[01:33:29.401 --> 01:33:34.323]  Years ago, I mean, 12, 14 years ago, I'd have Dr. Nick Begich on about it.
[01:33:34.323 --> 01:33:38.184]  He's written books on the subject, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:39.565 --> 01:33:46.610]  He has made films on the subject, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance.
[01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:50.212]  The issue here is, it's just like geoengineering.
[01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:56.952]  We know what's going on, they deny it, and then now they suddenly declassify a bunch of it.
[01:33:56.952 --> 01:34:00.333]  They admit it's going on, they don't declassify the entire program.
[01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:11.456]  And they tell people in USA Today, yes, we're mixing stuff with the jet fuel and spraying, but that part's secret, and it's to keep you safe from the end of the Earth because of global warming.
[01:34:11.456 --> 01:34:18.158]  I mean, what are they doing for 39 years in a global secret program taking blood from all babies at birth?
[01:34:18.158 --> 01:34:19.919]  In every nation controlled by the globalists.
[01:34:21.687 --> 01:34:22.868]  I mean, what is going on?
[01:34:22.868 --> 01:34:28.910]  There's this fake world we live in, and then there's the technocratic world that they've really designed.
[01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:31.871]  We're in this controlled reservation.
[01:34:31.871 --> 01:34:35.233]  And yes, these technologies could empower us.
[01:34:35.233 --> 01:34:38.334]  I'm not an anti-technology troglodyte here.
[01:34:38.334 --> 01:34:42.356]  I think it's great they've got systems now that are very expensive.
[01:34:42.356 --> 01:34:45.137]  That's why the globalists want to have socialized healthcare so you can't get it.
[01:34:45.916 --> 01:34:51.738]  They're now saying, oh, the case for killing Granny, we can hire 20 teachers if we kill Granny.
[01:34:51.738 --> 01:34:58.741]  They socialize things so they can then sell you on destroying others to get something so they can play us off against each other.
[01:34:58.741 --> 01:35:01.543]  Not some type of utopian socialism, but the...
[01:35:02.483 --> 01:35:11.107]  The issue I'm getting here is with miniaturization, with technology, with all of this, this is all going to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper for all of us.
[01:35:11.107 --> 01:35:23.653]  The globalists want to put in a global dictatorship before that happens, clamp down on the technology the general public can get, sequester it in technological reservations, corporations, universities, and government.
[01:35:24.815 --> 01:35:27.317]  And only allow a select few to have it.
[01:35:27.317 --> 01:35:35.283]  And in all their internal writings, the stuff that's even public, but not widely distributed, they talk about, we can't let the public know what we've got.
[01:35:35.283 --> 01:35:42.368]  Do we just entertain them and try to sterilize as many as we can, or we just go ahead and do the right thing and wipe these people out?
[01:35:42.368 --> 01:35:46.711]  That's what Bill Joy talks about in Wired Magazine, owner of Sun Microsystems.
[01:35:46.711 --> 01:35:50.454]  That's what Ted Turner, Prince Philip, that's why they're so arrogant.
[01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:52.956]  And I've talked to elitists off record, and they say, Alex,
[01:35:54.497 --> 01:35:55.881]  People go, well, tell us who they are.
[01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:59.312]  If I told you on record, they'd never talk to me again.
[01:35:59.312 --> 01:36:01.800]  But they're on record, many of them writing, saying, look...
[01:36:02.662 --> 01:36:05.443]  The people, this is all admitted and they don't care.
[01:36:05.443 --> 01:36:06.963]  They deserve to die.
[01:36:06.963 --> 01:36:08.364]  Well, I don't deserve to die.
[01:36:08.364 --> 01:36:11.285]  And the globalists say, well, then you should join us.
[01:36:11.285 --> 01:36:13.445]  Well, number one, you're a bunch of backstabbing scum.
[01:36:13.445 --> 01:36:16.246]  I will not join in what you're doing.
[01:36:16.246 --> 01:36:19.127]  But the issue is, Dr. Begich, here's my way of putting it.
[01:36:19.127 --> 01:36:25.509]  If you take wild pigs or wild deer or wild horses or wild bovine, wild cows, wild whatever the case is.
[01:36:26.349 --> 01:36:39.094]  Or domesticated, and you put a poison in the water that they can even taste, but it's the only water, they're gonna go and they're gonna drink it, and even as the cows and pigs die, they're still so stupid, they go and they drink it.
[01:36:39.094 --> 01:36:46.916]  Homo sapiens sapien is the only creature on this planet that we know of that, well, actually some insects would not drink it.
[01:36:46.916 --> 01:36:49.457]  It's funny, some of the lower animals, but then honeybees do.
[01:36:49.457 --> 01:36:50.558]  They're more like humans.
[01:36:50.558 --> 01:36:53.159]  They'll still eat the BT corn and die, but other animals won't.
[01:36:53.999 --> 01:36:55.659]  But it's like they've poisoned the well.
[01:36:55.659 --> 01:36:59.760]  They're turning up the ambient background noise of this system.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.201]  They're rolling all of this out against us.
[01:37:02.201 --> 01:37:03.261]  I see it triggering.
[01:37:03.261 --> 01:37:04.482]  I see it happening.
[01:37:04.482 --> 01:37:07.242]  I see the bone cancer exploding from the fluoride.
[01:37:07.242 --> 01:37:12.023]  The brain cancer emitted from the cell phones in that exact area where you hold the phone.
[01:37:12.023 --> 01:37:14.144]  The brainwave's changing.
[01:37:14.144 --> 01:37:15.764]  The IQ's dropping.
[01:37:15.764 --> 01:37:19.285]  The globalists giggling and snickering as they do this.
[01:37:19.285 --> 01:37:22.206]  I mean, they're soft-killing us now, getting us into a
[01:37:22.546 --> 01:37:30.872]  Catatonic, mind-controlled state, so when they really roll out the mass plagues and start killing the majority of us, the public will watch their glowing telescreens.
[01:37:30.872 --> 01:37:38.538]  At that point, they'll flip on the high-powered stuff to just sit there in your house and wait for help as they fly over with airplanes pumping the bioweapon out.
[01:37:38.538 --> 01:37:43.882]  I mean, I could see their plan as clear as I saw them blowing those towers up two months before that happened.
[01:37:44.222 --> 01:37:46.804]  I see this plan coming in the next decade or so.
[01:37:46.804 --> 01:37:49.486]  If we don't get the word out, Dr. Begich, I know I'm ranting.
[01:37:49.486 --> 01:37:52.328]  I want to hold you a little bit in the next hour if you can, because I'm ranting.
[01:37:52.328 --> 01:38:00.133]  You've got all the knowledge on this, but every bone in my body, every cell in my gut, everything in the pit of my stomach, my soul tells me
[01:38:00.433 --> 01:38:01.414]  And I have the evidence.
[01:38:01.414 --> 01:38:03.335]  As you said, most of this is public.
[01:38:03.335 --> 01:38:05.556]  They've already rolled this out against us.
[01:38:05.556 --> 01:38:06.757]  Tell us what they've got.
[01:38:06.757 --> 01:38:08.318]  What are your ideas to counter it?
[01:38:08.318 --> 01:38:14.482]  Do we try to get companies up to start scanning the TVs and things for these fields, studying carrier waves?
[01:38:14.482 --> 01:38:17.584]  Do companies come out with filters you put on your TV?
[01:38:17.584 --> 01:38:24.368]  How do we stop the fluorescent light bulbs that they're trying to force us to take, which they admit they're going to use to flicker control us?
[01:38:24.368 --> 01:38:27.470]  Notice, in government buildings is where they're starting with their own minions.
[01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:28.130]  Right.
[01:38:28.130 --> 01:38:31.093]  You know, this is all, as you say, it is being rolled out.
[01:38:31.093 --> 01:38:31.753]  It's being used.
[01:38:31.753 --> 01:38:35.656]  There's very little technology that we're protected from.
[01:38:35.656 --> 01:38:42.261]  The idea of building filters or creating systems that would not allow this is something that actually did come up.
[01:38:42.261 --> 01:38:43.042]  It came up by
[01:38:43.682 --> 01:38:51.606]  Some of the originators of the technology back in the 80s to screen out signals from our adversaries, but in so doing, we screen out our own.
[01:38:51.606 --> 01:39:01.550]  Because these are... It doesn't matter who's sending the signal, the signal structure has to be the same in order to create the same biological or physiological or mental effects.
[01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:03.311]  So how do they stop blowback?
[01:39:03.311 --> 01:39:06.993]  Well, you know, that is the problem, and I don't think they can.
[01:39:06.993 --> 01:39:12.215]  I think this technology is out of the can, and advancing fast enough and furiously enough
[01:39:12.791 --> 01:39:22.437]  Where there's enough independent work that ultimately it's a question of how much are they going to tell us and how much danger are our own systems in?
[01:39:22.437 --> 01:39:33.184]  Because I can tell you that every system that we have that could be effectively used as a carrier can be used by both commercial interests, governmental interests.
[01:39:33.184 --> 01:39:34.284]  It's not so much
[01:39:35.953 --> 01:39:40.094]  Worrying about just some big brother with the command and control of huge technology.
[01:39:40.094 --> 01:39:44.976]  It's gotten flatter, meaning more and more access to these kinds of systems.
[01:39:44.976 --> 01:39:59.540]  The flip side is this, is that in all of the research that I've done on this subject, the one thing that the military and other researchers discovered is a bit about the human potential, or what they now call anomalous human capabilities.
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.520]  These things that never, they could explain.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.680]  You know, mental telepathy.
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.581]  How does that work?
[01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:04.541]  Well now they're actually
[01:40:05.061 --> 01:40:05.541]  We're good.
[01:40:21.451 --> 01:40:28.458]  Meanwhile, the globalists tell the public none of this exists because they want you to be psychically or spiritually blind.
[01:40:28.458 --> 01:40:32.261]  Meanwhile, they've quantified it in tens of thousands of studies.
[01:40:32.261 --> 01:40:33.262]  Everybody's got it.
[01:40:33.262 --> 01:40:34.684]  Some people got a lot of it.
[01:40:34.684 --> 01:40:38.407]  They've tried to develop psychic boosters, all of that.
[01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:41.070]  Right, but we all have all of this latent capacity.
[01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:42.871]  It's our creative birthright.
[01:40:42.871 --> 01:40:44.473]  You know, we're created, I believe,
[01:40:45.129 --> 01:40:55.496]  In the image of a creator, and science is proving more and more that human beings are much more than we have ever thought about in terms of being just some... But the globalists know that!
[01:40:55.496 --> 01:40:58.518]  That's why everything they do is trying to suppress human potential.
[01:40:58.518 --> 01:41:11.487]  That's right, and the easiest and the most effective actually is through fear and worry, because if you look at an EEG, the mapping of the brain, actively engaged in fear or worry or these kinds of emotions,
[01:41:11.949 --> 01:41:20.366]  You get incoherent brain patterns, the kind that don't line up with this higher ordered experiential thinking and more intellectual thinking.
[01:41:20.366 --> 01:41:21.970]  When you get whole brain coherence...
[01:41:22.495 --> 01:41:25.237]  Where both hemispheres of the brain work together.
[01:41:25.237 --> 01:41:30.040]  They say that you can hit an ultimate unlimited IQ if you can achieve that.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.784]  And there are technologies that are advancing that allow us to achieve that.
[01:41:34.784 --> 01:41:42.349]  And when you start to think about what our potentials are and heading in that direction scares the hell out of elitists.
[01:41:42.836 --> 01:41:51.005]  From the standpoint that what do you do with billions of self-actualized, fully engaged humans on a planet like this?
[01:41:51.005 --> 01:41:57.212]  You unmask the deceit, you unmask the fear, and you liberate the human consciousness is what happens.
[01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:03.733]  The exact opposite of what established orders in the world today would like to see happen.
[01:42:03.733 --> 01:42:09.255]  And that is what needs to happen, and I believe that is the coming evolution of humankind.
[01:42:09.255 --> 01:42:12.556]  We are going to experience that in the 21st century.
[01:42:12.556 --> 01:42:23.500]  Either it's going to be stripped from us by an elitist, controlled, and directed society, or we're going to liberate ourselves and recognize what we are, and our science is going to support that.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:24.160]  Well, I...
[01:42:42.276 --> 01:42:47.579]  Well, that's my point here is that I don't come at this from a position of fear.
[01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:51.942]  I come at it from a position of extreme action and resistance.
[01:42:51.942 --> 01:42:52.842]  Right.
[01:42:52.842 --> 01:42:56.425]  But when I'm at home or researching, I'm very calm.
[01:42:56.425 --> 01:42:57.665]  My mind is focused.
[01:42:57.665 --> 01:43:03.549]  I have complete maps with the integrated information I have of basically enemy operations.
[01:43:03.549 --> 01:43:04.750]  But then verbally,
[01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:14.536]  It's so hard to articulate the full connections, the clarity, you can see the sophisticated enemy operations.
[01:43:14.536 --> 01:43:20.700]  I mean, years after I've already envisioned something, I can read declassified globalist handbooks, you name it.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:25.183]  It's word for word what I've already envisioned because humans are so similar.
[01:43:25.183 --> 01:43:28.345]  They're just working from a position of using it for bad.
[01:43:28.345 --> 01:43:33.429]  I've been able to see how they're using it and, you know, hopefully trying to change it.
[01:43:34.389 --> 01:43:44.061]  I found, though, the reason my show is successful is that for people who are in a mind-controlled state, people who are totally locked in, for whatever reason, you talk to most people,
[01:43:45.533 --> 01:43:47.915]  Of anybody out there, they'll say, who woke you up?
[01:43:47.915 --> 01:43:49.236]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:43:49.236 --> 01:44:00.465]  And I think it's because I am intellectual, I'm intelligent, probably not as intelligent as somebody like yourself, but I'm also have that primitive drive and an instinctive level.
[01:44:00.465 --> 01:44:03.688]  The biggest mind controller out there is the truth.
[01:44:03.688 --> 01:44:04.749]  People go with that.
[01:44:04.749 --> 01:44:08.392]  They can feel the instinctive tribal truth of what I'm saying.
[01:44:08.392 --> 01:44:09.472]  And so I'm able to
[01:44:10.313 --> 01:44:20.456]  Well, you know, I think that's exactly right on target because it's, you know, if you think about all the things that have ever altered our course in life, I mean, you can think about
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:36.581]  Everyone who has a little gray hair can identify with this.
[01:44:36.581 --> 01:44:42.083]  It's usually during the traumas, during the shocks, during the wake-up calls.
[01:44:42.083 --> 01:44:47.305]  It's very rarely through those high emotional states when everything is running well.
[01:44:47.305 --> 01:44:48.305]  The same is true here.
[01:44:48.305 --> 01:44:53.046]  I think that all of us, by delivering information, it does shock the consciousness.
[01:44:53.046 --> 01:44:57.908]  And it should, because it should awaken people to the possibilities of what's out there.
[01:44:57.908 --> 01:45:00.809]  But then quickly moving from there to saying, alright,
[01:45:01.389 --> 01:45:05.531]  Now that we know something, we're not powerless anymore.
[01:45:05.531 --> 01:45:14.055]  And it's taken that first step and having that resolve, when you start having little successes, little Trentons, then you can win the bigger wars.
[01:45:14.055 --> 01:45:15.756]  Right, that's exactly it.
[01:45:15.756 --> 01:45:27.761]  I'll tell you where it's really important, and you've led an activist life, and I have too, and we've watched a lot of our friends and colleagues fall by the wayside when they succumb and let fear overtake them.
[01:45:28.286 --> 01:45:30.288]  And it is one step at a time.
[01:45:30.288 --> 01:45:32.510]  You know, we each have a sphere of influence out there.
[01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:33.270]  All of us do.
[01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:44.500]  And if we execute against that, whether it's talking to our friends, our families, whether it's this issue or another issue, engage the world around us in a positive way about what we're passionate about.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:49.124]  And that passion will carry us forward in a much more positive way.
[01:45:49.124 --> 01:45:51.086]  And when it gets too overwhelming,
[01:45:51.755 --> 01:45:52.515]  Back off!
[01:45:52.515 --> 01:45:56.917]  Maybe it's a burden for your partner to carry.
[01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.997]  You know, not everyone has to carry it all.
[01:45:58.997 --> 01:46:00.238]  And there's a lot of us out there.
[01:46:00.238 --> 01:46:07.020]  There's what I believe the most powerful source of solution here is what I call the organic Internet.
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:09.260]  That's you and me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.561]  And we already are connected.
[01:46:10.561 --> 01:46:18.543]  We're connected by the human spirit, something no one else can interfere with in the profound ways they can with all of our other man-made systems.
[01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:23.673]  The fact is, we are in a unique club on the planet.
[01:46:23.673 --> 01:46:26.134]  We don't have to wait for leadership to arise.
[01:46:26.134 --> 01:46:27.515]  It already has.
[01:46:27.515 --> 01:46:30.216]  It's in each one of our created souls.
[01:46:37.859 --> 01:46:39.240]  Feel inadequate and small.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:45.942]  Madison Avenue's first tool, they admit, is to make you feel inadequate so they can sell you their crutches.
[01:46:45.942 --> 01:46:47.563]  The truth is, you're not inadequate.
[01:46:47.563 --> 01:46:49.063]  You're not an underachiever.
[01:46:49.063 --> 01:46:50.284]  You have incredible power.
[01:46:50.284 --> 01:46:53.385]  But realize, Rome wasn't built in a day.
[01:46:53.965 --> 01:46:56.586]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[01:46:56.586 --> 01:46:57.926]  Start little.
[01:46:57.926 --> 01:46:59.727]  So many activists overthink it.
[01:46:59.727 --> 01:47:06.209]  In my 16-year battle, we've had devastating effects on The Globalist by empowering people.
[01:47:06.209 --> 01:47:09.050]  It's our listeners are the real power of this show.
[01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:12.691]  It's the same thing with your 20 years of fighting Dr. Begich.
[01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:15.152]  I mean, it's had just unbelievable effects.
[01:47:15.694 --> 01:47:21.315]  Well, and you know, a lot of them you don't even plan for, and that's the beauty of it all.
[01:47:21.315 --> 01:47:27.557]  Some of the things that people have equated as small have actually been the most important things that have happened to us.
[01:47:27.557 --> 01:47:37.179]  I mean, we had a guy in a mail room once that reached out to a publisher in Germany that reached out and touched somebody in the right political place.
[01:47:37.179 --> 01:47:40.360]  And that chain of events started with just someone doing something.
[01:47:41.379 --> 01:47:45.321]  Allowed us to get this issue in front of, eventually, the European Parliament.
[01:47:45.321 --> 01:47:53.444]  I can trace it back to one event that somebody said was small, and it reminded me of the story of the Widow's Might, and many will remember that.
[01:47:53.444 --> 01:48:02.467]  You know, this is the person that gave what they had towards the effort they were engaged in, and what happened, it was so much bigger than the wealth of so many others.
[01:48:02.467 --> 01:48:04.708]  And that's how we have to look at our individual actions.
[01:48:04.708 --> 01:48:07.970]  What we do does, indeed, matter.
[01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:09.030]  And there are no small things.
[01:48:09.517 --> 01:48:20.159]  And, you know, in all of this, the idea of controlling the mind, that's where it starts, by us choosing where we're headed and begin to map our strategy of getting there.
[01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:25.900]  Well, instead of being intimidated by knowing this is rolling out, be glad that Dr. Begich is there to warn you.
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:26.920]  Be glad we're here.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.040]  Now warn others.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.541]  Don't just stop there, but also realize, why do they want to put something this draconian in?
[01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:35.221]  Because they're scared of you!
[01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:37.482]  Because you've got a chance to beat them!
[01:48:37.482 --> 01:48:38.642]  Because you've got power!
[01:48:39.142 --> 01:48:40.322]  That's exactly it.
[01:48:40.322 --> 01:48:53.685]  And it is that realization, all the work I've done in researching the mind effects, that conclusion that military and intelligence communities reach that, wow, if people knew how to do this stuff, we'd really be in trouble.
[01:48:53.685 --> 01:48:54.805]  And they would be.
[01:48:54.805 --> 01:49:02.947]  Because a fully actualized population that understands what each of us is capable of changes the playing field dramatically.
[01:49:02.947 --> 01:49:03.867]  And that's where we're at.
[01:49:03.867 --> 01:49:06.808]  And that's what this generation's choices will determine.
[01:49:07.148 --> 01:49:18.160]  Whether we live in a free and liberated society in terms of our basic human rights, or whether we're trampled on in an increasingly technocratic slavery.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.401]  And that's what I see.
[01:49:19.401 --> 01:49:22.144]  And it's not a question of speculation.
[01:49:22.144 --> 01:49:24.306]  It's based on really firm research.
[01:49:24.306 --> 01:49:26.469]  In the books that we've written, over 1,600 sources were cited.
[01:49:29.364 --> 01:49:36.066]  Well that's why the globalists are in a race to clamp all this down under this global dictatorship so they don't have to give us all of this.
[01:49:36.066 --> 01:49:39.907]  We've almost reached the point where they're not going to be in control.
[01:49:59.233 --> 01:50:06.436]  You know, and that's exactly it, because it doesn't take, and this is the other realization, it doesn't take that many.
[01:50:06.436 --> 01:50:10.818]  It doesn't take the 50% plus one to change the dynamic.
[01:50:10.818 --> 01:50:16.780]  Every major social, economic, political, scientific change that ever occurred on the planet
[01:50:17.273 --> 01:50:24.737]  Started with one or two people just seeing it a little differently, and there are way, way more than that seeing it a little bit differently these days.
[01:50:24.737 --> 01:50:26.998]  And I think that's where the great hope lies.
[01:50:26.998 --> 01:50:27.638]  You know what?
[01:50:27.638 --> 01:50:33.801]  What people are rebelling around, around the world in right now is not just, uh, you know, economics.
[01:50:33.801 --> 01:50:35.802]  It's about corruption.
[01:50:35.802 --> 01:50:37.042]  It's about liberty.
[01:50:37.042 --> 01:50:42.285]  It's about choosing self-determination, even though it may not line up with exactly what we think.
[01:50:43.186 --> 01:50:54.098]  They're rebelling against arrogance in government, the overall darkness of it, as the system tries to sell classical tyranny all over the planet as if it's good.
[01:50:54.098 --> 01:50:57.441]  They're trying to rebrand it and psychologically break our will.
[01:50:57.441 --> 01:50:58.683]  I see it backfiring.
[01:50:58.683 --> 01:50:59.684]  Dr. Begich, stay with us.
[01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.322]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:07.906]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.906 --> 01:51:12.929]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.929 --> 01:51:17.973]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.493 --> 01:51:23.718]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.718 --> 01:51:30.844]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.844 --> 01:51:31.964]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.964 --> 01:51:38.330]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.630 --> 01:51:41.832]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.832 --> 01:51:44.054]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.054 --> 01:51:44.834]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.834 --> 01:51:45.094]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.094 --> 01:51:48.636]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.636 --> 01:51:50.358]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.584 --> 01:52:07.026]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:02.531]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[01:53:02.531 --> 01:53:03.131]  I have.
[01:53:03.131 --> 01:53:07.852]  And all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars.
[01:53:07.852 --> 01:53:12.173]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[01:53:12.173 --> 01:53:17.994]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[01:53:17.994 --> 01:53:21.075]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[01:53:21.075 --> 01:53:24.496]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death.
[01:53:24.496 --> 01:53:28.577]  And yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best
[01:53:30.776 --> 01:53:30.896]  Bye!
[01:54:17.489 --> 01:54:28.197]  Dr. Begich will be with us about 15 minutes into the next hour.
[01:54:28.197 --> 01:54:33.260]  Then I'm going to get into the whole left-right issue in Wisconsin.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:34.561]  The beginning of austerity.
[01:54:34.561 --> 01:54:35.502]  We let it all out.
[01:54:35.502 --> 01:54:37.703]  We know how it's going to unfold.
[01:54:37.703 --> 01:54:44.829]  The globalists are going to play the government workers and other union workers off against what's left of the free market population.
[01:54:46.263 --> 01:54:55.991]  Having us fight with each other instead of looking at the big mega banks that have already sucked this country and countless other nations dry over and over again.
[01:54:55.991 --> 01:54:59.374]  See, Michael Moore says, oh, the big banks are corrupt.
[01:54:59.374 --> 01:55:01.616]  We need to get the money.
[01:55:01.616 --> 01:55:07.801]  It's a national resource, but they're going to get our money and transfer it to the bankers.
[01:55:07.801 --> 01:55:09.983]  Why do you think Hollywood finances him?
[01:55:09.983 --> 01:55:12.285]  Why do you think he's worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars?
[01:55:12.285 --> 01:55:14.787]  He's a cold-blooded operative.
[01:55:15.799 --> 01:55:17.541]  Who knows full well what he's doing.
[01:55:17.541 --> 01:55:18.381]  So does Glenn Beck.
[01:55:18.381 --> 01:55:20.743]  And I'm going to break all this down coming up.
[01:55:20.743 --> 01:55:23.706]  Okay, if you really want to know.
[01:55:23.706 --> 01:55:31.332]  And by the way, there's these conservatives out there when the liberals, they're not even liberals, are saying, you don't have a right to your own money, which means you're a slave.
[01:55:31.332 --> 01:55:33.334]  And the guy's like, well, you don't make anything of value.
[01:55:33.334 --> 01:55:34.655]  And they go, well, what do you do?
[01:55:34.655 --> 01:55:36.737]  The guy's a defense contractor.
[01:55:36.737 --> 01:55:39.640]  He's on the government feed as well.
[01:55:41.414 --> 01:55:43.094]  Which is what Eisenhower warned about.
[01:55:43.094 --> 01:55:45.095]  It's a tiny group running it all.
[01:55:45.095 --> 01:55:46.595]  This is not a free market.
[01:55:46.595 --> 01:55:49.696]  But Dr. Begich is with us for about 20 more minutes now.
[01:55:49.696 --> 01:55:56.718]  Dr. Begich, we've talked about some of the negative, some of the positive, but let's go through some more patents, some more systems of mind control.
[01:55:56.718 --> 01:56:05.861]  The carrier waves on cell phones, the coupling with the eyes, and the television set, what's going on, how they can manipulate other psychotronic ways they're controlling us.
[01:56:06.328 --> 01:56:13.199]  Well, if you think about modulating a signal on television, let me just explain a couple of simple ways that that works.
[01:56:14.252 --> 01:56:24.899]  Basically, the light emitted from a TV, if you go into a dark room and you look at the white wall behind you, don't look at the TV, look at where it's projecting.
[01:56:24.899 --> 01:56:27.841]  And you'll see the light flicker, you know, you'll notice that.
[01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:35.986]  If you can maintain a specific pulse rate for just a few seconds, 10-15 seconds, the brain will begin to follow that.
[01:56:35.986 --> 01:56:39.028]  It's called a frequency following response.
[01:56:39.028 --> 01:56:42.931]  And whether it's coming in through the optic nerve, through the eye, by the flicker of the light,
[01:56:43.622 --> 01:56:45.024]  Or you can do it through sound.
[01:56:45.024 --> 01:56:49.510]  By engineering sound in a very specific way, you can create the same kind of effect.
[01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:55.458]  You can also do it with electromagnetic currents or electromagnetic fields that you're in close proximity to.
[01:56:55.458 --> 01:57:00.104]  But what happens is, the brain locks onto that external signal and begins to mirror it.
[01:57:00.104 --> 01:57:00.465]  And so...
[01:57:01.201 --> 01:57:21.358]  You can actually put someone in either a highly agitated state if you chose to, maybe right before the broadcast news where you're going to indict a certain political group or a certain faction of our community against one another, and all of a sudden you've got all this anger being directed at, you know, maybe a situation normally you wouldn't direct it at at all.
[01:57:21.358 --> 01:57:27.624]  Or even more simply, putting you in a more passive, almost a trance-like state where you can then
[01:57:28.144 --> 01:57:29.164]  Deliver information.
[01:57:29.164 --> 01:57:30.165]  Just deliver the news.
[01:57:30.165 --> 01:57:31.305]  Just deliver the commercial.
[01:57:31.305 --> 01:57:32.725]  Just deliver the soap opera.
[01:57:32.725 --> 01:57:35.586]  Whatever it is that you're being programmed with.
[01:57:35.586 --> 01:57:39.987]  Because the mind will absorb that and literally accept the programming.
[01:57:39.987 --> 01:57:41.427]  And that is what you're doing.
[01:57:41.427 --> 01:57:45.628]  It's almost humorous if you think about it.
[01:57:45.628 --> 01:57:47.069]  You're watching the program.
[01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:51.069]  You talk about programming routinely when you talk about television.
[01:57:51.069 --> 01:57:56.231]  But you never really think about the fact that you are being programmed.
[01:57:56.231 --> 01:57:57.431]  My wife and I are raising our
[01:57:58.488 --> 01:58:07.895]  Grandchild and I joke about a little bit, you know, because the messaging that you give a four-year-old a three-year-old a two-year-old Is essentially human programming.
[01:58:07.895 --> 01:58:12.839]  It's based on your emotions and your delivery and how you do it But we do it as parents.
[01:58:12.839 --> 01:58:14.460]  We do it as grandparents.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:21.546]  We do it all the time, but when it's done to us in a way that's Engineered for a result.
[01:58:21.546 --> 01:58:22.847]  Is that manipulation?
[01:58:23.887 --> 01:58:32.593]  No, it's slavery, and there's one thing with ancient human instincts that's our base programming to pass on what's common sense and good for us.
[01:58:32.593 --> 01:58:39.118]  The globalists are giving us artificial programming covertly to hurt us, and it's absolutely criminal.
[01:58:39.118 --> 01:58:42.400]  We'll be right back in one minute.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.902]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.879 --> 01:58:52.040]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:58.986]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.986 --> 01:59:01.548]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.548 --> 01:59:06.912]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.912 --> 01:59:09.954]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:09.954 --> 01:59:12.016]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.276 --> 01:59:18.521]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.521 --> 01:59:21.904]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.904 --> 01:59:27.689]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.689 --> 01:59:29.330]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:30.631]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.631 --> 01:59:33.293]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.293 --> 01:59:37.517]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.517 --> 01:59:39.238]  You can find the video at www.
[01:59:40.319 --> 01:59:42.121]  End of America 3 dot com.
[01:59:42.121 --> 01:59:44.704]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.

[01:59:53.834 --> 01:59:56.216]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.216 --> 01:59:58.999]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.578 --> 02:00:10.422]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.422 --> 02:00:12.003]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.003 --> 02:00:13.545]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.545 --> 02:00:17.748]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.748 --> 02:00:21.792]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.652 --> 02:00:24.094]  Okay, I've asked my questions.
[02:00:24.094 --> 02:00:25.495]  I've made my points.
[02:00:25.495 --> 02:00:31.180]  He's one of the type of guests that really gets me raving because it's just so many thoughts go through my mind.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:37.405]  But in this short segment and for the next, Dr. Baggots, let's get into more of these technologies, more of these control systems.
[02:00:39.307 --> 02:00:46.773]  Where you see this, you know, moving to, how it's unfolding, why do we see the media starting to talk about it so much?
[02:00:46.773 --> 02:00:52.258]  Does that mean that there is a rollout of this about to happen as they try to normalize it?
[02:00:52.258 --> 02:00:53.679]  Dr. Begich, you've got the floor.
[02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:58.022]  Yeah, I think it is about normalizing it, you know, because the warnings were issued long ago.
[02:00:58.022 --> 02:01:05.969]  You know, even The Economist, which people see as one of the more prestigious magazines in the world, their cover story in May 2002, now that's
[02:01:07.737 --> 02:01:07.997]  I think.
[02:01:26.354 --> 02:01:27.974]  When's it right, when's it wrong?
[02:01:27.974 --> 02:01:36.076]  There used to be a book years ago, it's been out of print, it's called Mine, A Man, The Manipulator, and it explains the difference between persuasion and manipulation.
[02:01:36.076 --> 02:01:39.176]  Persuasion is, you know, what the country was really based on.
[02:01:39.176 --> 02:01:53.139]  It was the idea that you would have political, vibrant political debate, the right of assembly, free speech, freedom of religion, all these things that create the environment of free-thinking individuals that have a right to some level of self-determination.
[02:01:53.763 --> 02:01:59.947]  That's sort of the foundation under which this country formed and a lot of the thinking that we started with formed.
[02:01:59.947 --> 02:02:08.851]  And I say thinking, because in those days, whether you were the shopkeeper, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, you participated in your government.
[02:02:08.851 --> 02:02:17.076]  In fact, you were probably all of those things and had those skills just to function as a normal human being a few hundred years ago.
[02:02:17.076 --> 02:02:20.378]  Today, our skill sets are so different.
[02:02:20.758 --> 02:02:25.922]  The idea of being able to survive independently is not the creation of business school.
[02:02:25.922 --> 02:02:39.752]  You know, business schools create dependence and a requirement where you really don't have freedom, where you're literally pushed directions all through the day from the time you wake up until you sleep at night.
[02:02:40.399 --> 02:02:44.981]  That is so contrary to our basic nature, number one.
[02:02:44.981 --> 02:02:51.783]  At the same time, when you look at the amount of change that's on our horizon and what's coming.
[02:02:51.783 --> 02:02:58.686]  I mean, anyone who's lived 50 years has seen the revolution, you know, in terms of technology.
[02:02:58.686 --> 02:03:00.827]  But you have seen nothing yet.
[02:03:00.827 --> 02:03:07.249]  Everything you've seen, from the invention of the wheel to where we are today, will be repeated every nine months.
[02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:18.592]  Or so, from here on out, and getting smaller and tighter and faster because of our computing power, our ability to process information, and this is where I was speaking earlier about resolution.
[02:03:19.181 --> 02:03:37.636]  You know, being able to see things more clearly, influence things more clearly, requires a higher and higher degree of resolution in terms of our circuitry and the fineness of that circuitry to discern these very minute and unusual signals that now we're not only able to discern, but we're able to manipulate.
[02:03:37.636 --> 02:03:45.062]  Whether it's the activity within our brains that fit a very specific pattern when you're having very specific thoughts,
[02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:48.572]  And the idea of transferring those from one human being to another.
[02:03:48.572 --> 02:03:59.463]  Right now, DARPA has two contracts at the University of California operating today that are to determine how that mechanism works for creating artificial telepathy.
[02:03:59.463 --> 02:04:06.330]  But I can tell you, there was work done in 1985 and I've seen the unpublished work by one of the best
[02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:31.777]  In this field in the world that in 85 they were able to take nine test subjects in two separate rooms and transfer information from one mind to the other accurately and they were using the cards that show squares and circles and rectangles and all these different shapes and with a hundred percent accuracy with people had no previous knowledge that they had this capacity using an electronic apparatus were able to do
[02:04:32.117 --> 02:04:35.699]  And that's why the globalists don't want us to have our own morals, our own compass.
[02:04:35.699 --> 02:04:40.442]  That's why they don't want parents, when kids are young, to put your own ideas in them.
[02:04:40.442 --> 02:04:42.804]  They say, oh, let your kid be themselves.
[02:04:42.804 --> 02:04:52.489]  That's so they can do all the programming and teach them how to fail, teach them how to commit suicide, which they admit the anti-suicide education has made it go off the charts.
[02:04:52.489 --> 02:04:56.352]  So they increase the funding because it's not failing, it's succeeding.
[02:04:57.435 --> 02:04:59.096]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:04:59.096 --> 02:05:00.057]  Stay there, Dr. Baggett.
[02:05:00.057 --> 02:05:00.877]  More straight ahead.
[02:05:00.877 --> 02:05:01.337]  Hi, folks.
[02:05:01.337 --> 02:05:05.060]  This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:11.464]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:11.464 --> 02:05:15.366]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[02:05:15.546 --> 02:05:18.847]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[02:05:18.847 --> 02:05:23.729]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:05:23.729 --> 02:05:32.392]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:05:32.392 --> 02:05:36.114]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:05:36.638 --> 02:05:43.405]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:43.405 --> 02:05:47.329]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:47.329 --> 02:05:53.675]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:05:53.675 --> 02:05:54.456]  Thank you.
[02:06:01.496 --> 02:06:16.971]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:06:16.971 --> 02:06:20.655]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:21.656 --> 02:06:34.428]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:06:34.428 --> 02:06:41.694]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:06:42.375 --> 02:06:52.747]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:06:52.747 --> 02:06:56.672]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:06:56.672 --> 02:06:59.435]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:07:00.396 --> 02:07:04.957]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:07:04.957 --> 02:07:05.857]  Number one.
[02:07:05.857 --> 02:07:09.298]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.298 --> 02:07:10.138]  Number two.
[02:07:10.138 --> 02:07:15.039]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.039 --> 02:07:15.779]  It's true.
[02:07:15.779 --> 02:07:20.660]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:21.480]  Number three.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:25.061]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.061 --> 02:07:28.762]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.962 --> 02:07:29.762]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.762 --> 02:07:32.523]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.523 --> 02:07:36.205]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.205 --> 02:07:37.005]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.005 --> 02:07:41.147]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.147 --> 02:07:46.189]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:50.370]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:52.151]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.151 --> 02:07:56.753]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:07:57.113 --> 02:07:58.374]  We go back to the 1950s.
[02:07:58.374 --> 02:08:13.565]  There were many cases of the CIA testing LSD and other drugs on unsuspecting members of the public, dropping it in their drinks.
[02:08:26.105 --> 02:08:28.766]  Giving it to their own military personnel.
[02:08:28.766 --> 02:08:35.187]  You know all the examples of declassified times when they would nerve gas our own troops.
[02:08:35.187 --> 02:08:43.029]  I mean, it's about playing God and shifting gears into an interesting area with Dr. Nick Baggage talking about mind control.
[02:08:43.029 --> 02:08:46.350]  All of his great books and videos available at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:51.951]  Controlling the human mind, the technologies of political control, or tools for peak performance.
[02:08:52.771 --> 02:08:59.134]  Angels Don't Play This Harp, Getting Into Harp, The Mind Control DVD, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance.
[02:08:59.134 --> 02:09:07.558]  The Harp DVD, they're all available again at InfoWars.com, or you can go to his website as well, EarthPulse.com.
[02:09:07.558 --> 02:09:09.859]  By the way, I've sent him a video Skype camera and stuff.
[02:09:09.859 --> 02:09:14.321]  You may be seeing Dr. Nick Begich, he's fixing, he's changing offices right now.
[02:09:15.922 --> 02:09:22.895]  Guest hosting some of the near future should be able to hear him unbridled without my interjections But but but Charlie Sheen
[02:09:23.826 --> 02:09:31.570]  The Charlie Sheen I've known, a lot of people that know him well have said, man, he's a quiet, nice, humble guy who's really giving.
[02:09:31.570 --> 02:09:34.092]  All of a sudden, he seems really wild.
[02:09:34.092 --> 02:09:39.354]  I mean, could it be that he was sober for almost a decade, then went back on stuff for seven months.
[02:09:39.354 --> 02:09:40.895]  Now he's kind of manic.
[02:09:40.895 --> 02:09:47.139]  When I got him on a few weeks ago, I wasn't expecting that, because when I was at his house a week before that, he wasn't manic.
[02:09:47.139 --> 02:09:50.941]  Now, you know, I told him, I said, they're going to fire you.
[02:09:51.841 --> 02:09:56.505]  And I said, you need to try to, you know, even though they've been attacking you and stuff, you need to try to get along with them.
[02:09:56.505 --> 02:10:05.812]  But more and more, I look at some of these Hollywood stars, and you have to ask, I mean, it's a great example of not just government people, but folks that are due to be paid $200-plus million.
[02:10:05.812 --> 02:10:08.574]  You know, does somebody want to cheat them out of that?
[02:10:08.574 --> 02:10:11.155]  Is somebody slipping a Mickey in his drink?
[02:10:11.155 --> 02:10:13.697]  Is there some type of psychotronic thing going on?
[02:10:13.697 --> 02:10:16.199]  Because I've been there when he's getting blood tested and urine tested.
[02:10:16.199 --> 02:10:17.720]  He is off drugs.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:19.101]  Or is it just he's manic?
[02:10:19.101 --> 02:10:20.202]  Or what's going on?
[02:10:20.202 --> 02:10:21.123]  I mean, any views on that?
[02:10:21.423 --> 02:10:37.635]  Well, you know, I can tell you that you see it in a lot of people right now, and the swings of emotions, and if you look at a lot of the underlying factors, I think are these stressors that we're talking about.
[02:10:37.635 --> 02:10:45.321]  You know, the fact that people who didn't use cell phones, who didn't have a wireless world surrounding them at the level at which we
[02:10:47.643 --> 02:11:01.435]  I was about to say, he lives on his cell phone and they admit that cell phones and ABC News increase brain activity and almost create a manic-like state.
[02:11:01.435 --> 02:11:04.738]  Right, and so why expect anything else?
[02:11:04.738 --> 02:11:07.401]  And look at the population across the population.
[02:11:07.401 --> 02:11:09.803]  We have more people on psychoactive drugs
[02:11:10.484 --> 02:11:16.367]  Because of some depression or illness and, you know, I can tell you where I live.
[02:11:16.367 --> 02:11:19.369]  I live in a very dark place, Alaska, in the winter.
[02:11:19.369 --> 02:11:19.989]  It's horrible.
[02:11:19.989 --> 02:11:23.451]  You know, and it affects me profoundly, I can tell you.
[02:11:23.451 --> 02:11:30.075]  And if it wasn't for some level of vitamin D supplements, I would be a total wreck.
[02:11:30.075 --> 02:11:32.716]  And most people are vitamin D deficient.
[02:11:32.716 --> 02:11:36.138]  That's another article that ran finally recently in the news.
[02:11:36.138 --> 02:11:37.359]  We've been saying it for years.
[02:11:38.055 --> 02:11:39.215]  Check your D-levels.
[02:11:39.215 --> 02:11:41.196]  Most people work in cubicle world today.
[02:11:41.196 --> 02:11:42.316]  They don't even get in the sun.
[02:11:42.316 --> 02:11:45.317]  And when they do, they're so screen-blocked, they don't get any sun.
[02:11:45.317 --> 02:11:47.978]  And vitamin D is leading to more depression.
[02:11:47.978 --> 02:11:53.340]  And then you lay on top of that electromagnetic field interference and the chemicals that we ingest.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:12:00.462]  And anything less than manic behavior from time to time would be the exception.
[02:12:00.462 --> 02:12:04.223]  And I'll tell you when you really notice it is when the power grid fails in your area.
[02:12:04.223 --> 02:12:06.424]  And you notice how quiet it gets.
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.241]  Uh, but you also notice your whole body takes an exhale.
[02:12:10.241 --> 02:12:17.703]  Your whole body relaxes as you quit compensating for those external fields that are there, like background noise in a crowded room.
[02:12:17.703 --> 02:12:24.585]  It's what you were talking about earlier in the program, Alex, getting out of the, in the country, in a remote place where you're away from it.
[02:12:24.585 --> 02:12:27.726]  How much better do you feel, unless you're from New York City?
[02:12:27.726 --> 02:12:31.047]  Well, you know, this proves it because I'm not consciously
[02:12:32.227 --> 02:12:39.230]  I'm thinking about what you're saying at the time, but over my life, whenever there's a citywide blackout, it cuts off.
[02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:41.130]  And it's not just the excitement of the power being off.
[02:12:41.130 --> 02:12:46.832]  You walk outside, whether it's day or night, and you suddenly just, oh, it feels so good.
[02:12:46.832 --> 02:12:49.113]  It's like magic.
[02:12:49.113 --> 02:12:50.714]  That's the feel, isn't it?
[02:12:50.714 --> 02:12:51.054]  It is.
[02:12:51.054 --> 02:12:51.674]  And it is.
[02:12:51.674 --> 02:12:58.977]  And because we're in it, there's an old Chinese saying, you know, what's the sound of being born into an explosion?
[02:12:58.977 --> 02:12:59.917]  It's called silence.
[02:13:00.213 --> 02:13:01.914]  Because you don't notice it in sound.
[02:13:01.914 --> 02:13:03.534]  That's what has happened.
[02:13:03.534 --> 02:13:11.218]  As we've immersed ourselves in this electromagnetic soup, it's been a creeping sound of silence.
[02:13:11.218 --> 02:13:18.841]  That now, when we truly have silence, and that interference is gone, we fully notice it.
[02:13:18.841 --> 02:13:23.463]  It's why when we come home from work, one of the first things we do is we kick our shoes off.
[02:13:23.463 --> 02:13:27.465]  And the reason is, most of us have soles that actually insulate us.
[02:13:27.970 --> 02:13:35.772]  from the electrical currents within the ground, and there are currents within the ground, that our body will in fact, and does in fact, rely on.
[02:13:35.772 --> 02:13:40.853]  The natural rhythm of this planet is 7.83 Hertz, called Schumann's Resonance.
[02:13:40.853 --> 02:13:43.853]  Well that's why, that's how birds can navigate.
[02:13:43.853 --> 02:13:47.634]  Right, but in Schumann's Resonance, that's the ideal state.
[02:13:47.634 --> 02:13:52.215]  If your brain is between 7 and 8 Hertz, you're in this super creative,
[02:13:52.973 --> 02:13:54.013]  Um, space.
[02:13:54.013 --> 02:13:56.154]  That is quite remarkable if you can stay there.
[02:13:56.154 --> 02:13:59.595]  And that's the natural rhythm of the planet and where we should be.
[02:13:59.595 --> 02:14:02.175]  Instead, we're at 60 cycles in the U.S.
[02:14:02.175 --> 02:14:08.657]  or pulses per second, the pulsation of our power grid as our primary sort of interference place.
[02:14:08.657 --> 02:14:18.240]  But then we have on top of that now, uh, Wi-Fi, wireless of various bandwidths being pulse modulated, creating other secondary effects.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:19.160]  This is where that
[02:14:19.764 --> 02:14:24.308]  sense of stress that explodes irrationally from time to time.
[02:14:24.308 --> 02:14:26.950]  Maybe it does explain what happened to Charlie.
[02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:35.236]  You know, the fact is, it's happening more frequently with more people and our solution is Medicaid of dumb them down and numb them down.
[02:14:35.236 --> 02:14:36.838]  That is not the right solution.
[02:14:36.838 --> 02:14:40.861]  The solution is, how do we learn how to modulate our own brain activity?
[02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:45.625]  And there are ways to do this, to learn how to do it, so you're not at the whims of every
[02:14:46.346 --> 02:14:55.281]  Everything that influences you, and quite frankly, what used to take years to perfect, now technology offers opportunities to learn how to find that space.
[02:14:56.201 --> 02:14:56.622]  I don't
[02:15:20.325 --> 02:15:21.945]  Well, you know one thing I've noticed?
[02:15:21.945 --> 02:15:42.191]  Elites, truly rich billionaires are all moving to extremely rural areas and when you talk to them they basically wink-wink and say we're getting away from all the stuff happening in the city, all the pollution, all the cell phones, and I mean they certainly know what's going on.
[02:15:42.191 --> 02:15:43.932]  Yeah, you know I have a remote place.
[02:15:43.932 --> 02:15:47.052]  Mine takes two days to walk in overland.
[02:15:47.052 --> 02:15:48.953]  There's no trails or roads or anything.
[02:15:49.785 --> 02:15:50.886]  And mine's for other reasons.
[02:15:50.886 --> 02:15:52.006]  I got a mining property.
[02:15:52.006 --> 02:15:54.167]  It's 800 acres with some partners.
[02:15:54.167 --> 02:15:55.987]  You know when you go out there?
[02:15:55.987 --> 02:15:57.748]  I'm in a valley that's closed off.
[02:15:57.748 --> 02:16:06.411]  I do get a cell phone signal, believe it or not, in some places, which totally blows me away because I'm in the most remote spot on the planet.
[02:16:06.411 --> 02:16:11.413]  But other than that, there is no power grid for at least 30 miles away from me.
[02:16:11.889 --> 02:16:12.369]  I think so.
[02:16:27.403 --> 02:16:30.565]  The biggest thing people can start with is stop watching television.
[02:16:30.565 --> 02:16:34.186]  That's where the most programming is, that's where it's designed, that's where not just the frequency but also the messages
[02:16:47.953 --> 02:16:48.033]  Yep.
[02:17:06.886 --> 02:17:07.646]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:17:07.646 --> 02:17:10.688]  It's going to be a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to working with you.
[02:17:10.688 --> 02:17:12.608]  It's going to be a great experience.
[02:17:12.608 --> 02:17:13.389]  I'm getting my backdrop.
[02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:15.830]  My office is a mess right now, but it's about reorganizing.
[02:17:36.144 --> 02:17:38.285]  Hey, just a bookshelf in the background looks great.
[02:17:38.285 --> 02:17:39.805]  Dr. Begich, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:17:39.805 --> 02:17:40.186]  All right.
[02:17:40.186 --> 02:17:41.386]  God bless.
[02:17:41.386 --> 02:17:41.986]  God bless you.
[02:17:41.986 --> 02:17:43.227]  What a great guy.
[02:17:43.227 --> 02:17:50.910]  Folks, you know, a lot of scary things we were talking about, but it's more scary not knowing it's there.
[02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:54.451]  It's a lot better to know the truth.
[02:17:54.451 --> 02:17:56.472]  It's very, very empowering.
[02:17:56.472 --> 02:17:56.632]  Now,
[02:18:00.478 --> 02:18:04.924]  First off, I have had the worst... I haven't really been sick in like four years.
[02:18:04.924 --> 02:18:06.006]  Truly sick.
[02:18:06.006 --> 02:18:10.011]  I get allergies and stuff, but I have had... I talked to doctors about it.
[02:18:10.011 --> 02:18:11.554]  They said, no, it's going all over the country.
[02:18:12.807 --> 02:18:13.167]  We're good to go.
[02:18:32.799 --> 02:18:38.022]  And I'm just glad to be almost back because I probably shouldn't have done the show yesterday.
[02:18:38.022 --> 02:18:39.863]  I was so punch drunk.
[02:18:39.863 --> 02:18:42.664]  I want to come back and get into the left-right paradigm.
[02:18:42.664 --> 02:18:44.866]  Pressure from above, pressure from below.
[02:18:44.866 --> 02:18:51.289]  We're going to get into the whole situation with the unions and the deception that's going on there.
[02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:53.790]  But before we go to break, I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com.
[02:18:55.071 --> 02:18:58.112]  They're having that special they only do once a year or so.

[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:05.364]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:22:05.364 --> 02:22:08.608]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:22:08.608 --> 02:22:13.754]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:13.754 --> 02:22:19.800]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:22.043]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:22:22.563 --> 02:22:22.863]  Tim Geithner?
[02:22:22.863 --> 02:22:23.184]  Bernanke?
[02:22:23.184 --> 02:22:23.684]  They're arsonists!
[02:22:23.684 --> 02:22:24.505]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:24.505 --> 02:22:26.187]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:41.485 --> 02:22:43.307]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:43.307 --> 02:22:48.751]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:22:48.751 --> 02:22:57.939]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:23:00.106 --> 02:23:03.909]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made, and all-natural food.
[02:23:03.909 --> 02:23:07.812]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:11.975]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[02:23:11.975 --> 02:23:12.896]  That's why you need...
[02:23:14.913 --> 02:23:16.094]  Sea energy.
[02:23:16.094 --> 02:23:25.920]  From AffinitySeaEnergy.com, sea vegetation is known to be the richest source of organic minerals, and that's what you'll find in all-natural, great-tasting sea energy.

[02:23:48.652 --> 02:23:48.933]  That's 855-732-3637.
[02:23:48.933 --> 02:23:50.653]  Or go to AffinitySeaEnergy.com today.
[02:23:50.653 --> 02:23:51.374]  I'm your master's ovoire.
[02:24:08.467 --> 02:24:12.813]  It'll build the big guns.
[02:24:12.813 --> 02:24:17.140]  It'll build the death planes.
[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:19.023]  It'll build all the bombs.
[02:24:23.709 --> 02:24:37.617]  When you're dealing with the globalists, you have to understand that they've run the same scams over and over again in first world, second world, developing and undeveloped nations, third world nations.
[02:24:37.617 --> 02:24:40.158]  And so they've really had time to tweak it.
[02:24:40.158 --> 02:24:41.479]  And none of this is my opinion.
[02:24:42.299 --> 02:24:44.261]  We have IMF World Bank documents.
[02:24:44.261 --> 02:25:02.353]  We have the thousands of pages that got leaked in 2002, where they talk about how they get countries in debt, knowing they can never pay it back, and then blow out their economy, and then order the government to sell off all their infrastructure to them for pennies on the dollar, and then the banks go in and make sure that they can never rebuild any infrastructure.
[02:25:03.254 --> 02:25:05.955]  The name of the game is control.
[02:25:05.955 --> 02:25:15.837]  There's so much wealth, so much ingenuity, that every country should be a shining jewel with everybody basically living in mansions.
[02:25:15.837 --> 02:25:19.618]  The name of the game is stopping that, okay?
[02:25:19.618 --> 02:25:21.838]  And creating artificial scarcity.
[02:25:21.838 --> 02:25:27.420]  I got Aaron Dykes coming in here because he heard me with Lord Monckton earlier today.
[02:25:29.219 --> 02:25:35.002]  Talking about the head of the British power system saying we're going to start cutting your power off.
[02:25:35.002 --> 02:25:36.943]  You'll not have power a lot of the time.
[02:25:36.943 --> 02:25:41.225]  It's for the earth.
[02:25:41.225 --> 02:25:43.606]  Venezuela could supply power 24 hours a day.
[02:25:43.606 --> 02:25:45.607]  It's a tool of control.
[02:25:45.607 --> 02:25:47.428]  And Ceausescu in Romania could.
[02:25:47.428 --> 02:25:48.808]  North Korea could.
[02:25:48.808 --> 02:25:54.271]  They made the decision that you don't get the power and you're thankful when you get it.
[02:25:56.889 --> 02:25:59.810]  This is the mark of third-world-dom.
[02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:02.071]  This is a post-industrial world.
[02:26:02.071 --> 02:26:07.794]  The head of the British Power Authority says they're doing it on purpose.
[02:26:07.794 --> 02:26:09.955]  I read to you out of the London Telegraph earlier.
[02:26:09.955 --> 02:26:11.176]  It's him saying it.
[02:26:13.396 --> 02:26:20.539]  And Aaron's like, when you made that video a month ago about Obama causing the power outages, I saw the documents but I didn't really get it.
[02:26:20.539 --> 02:26:39.546]  He was like laughing, he was like, I just watched Enron, the smartest guys in the room, you know, made six, seven years ago, and it's got Ken Lay admitting that they shut down power plants on purpose to jack up prices in California and that he wrote the carbon tax plan as part of the Agenda 21 Biological Diversity Assessment and Sustainable Development.
[02:26:40.529 --> 02:26:43.610]  And so Aaron's in there printing off all their statements.
[02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:44.310]  Yes!
[02:26:44.310 --> 02:26:44.990]  Yes!
[02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:46.230]  Yes!
[02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:47.551]  It's all premeditated.
[02:26:47.551 --> 02:26:48.811]  It's all public.
[02:26:48.811 --> 02:26:50.531]  It has nothing to do with the earth.
[02:26:50.531 --> 02:26:55.073]  It's about there being a fraction of the power plants left owned by them.
[02:26:55.073 --> 02:26:59.634]  And you'll pay for an hour of power what you paid previously for 24 hours.
[02:26:59.634 --> 02:27:00.414]  And you'll thank them!
[02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:05.915]  But all the government facilities and all the cop shops, they're all going to have power.
[02:27:05.915 --> 02:27:14.004]  You know, Tarrytown and downtown Austin and the police departments here in Austin, they were all exempt from the rolling blackouts.
[02:27:14.004 --> 02:27:18.208]  The rich, wealthy, liberal, trendy area, they're exempt.
[02:27:18.208 --> 02:27:21.832]  I'm not exempt where I live.
[02:27:21.832 --> 02:27:22.453]  They stole
[02:27:24.198 --> 02:27:30.501]  More than 20,000 acres in one initiative back in the late 1990s called Save Our Springs.
[02:27:30.501 --> 02:27:35.943]  And they said, we're going to take all these ranchers and farmers property in southwest Austin.
[02:27:35.943 --> 02:27:42.106]  And for a decade before that, they wouldn't let them build with city zoning or sell it, but kept their property taxes up.
[02:27:43.342 --> 02:27:48.964]  And so then they came and said, we're going to have a giant 15,000 acre park, 1,000 acre park, and these other parts.
[02:27:48.964 --> 02:27:50.724]  It was around 20,000 acres.
[02:27:50.724 --> 02:27:59.187]  And they said, we're going to pay for about $0.05 on the dollar, basically force, with adverse possession, these farmers, ranchers, and developers to sell.
[02:27:59.997 --> 02:28:17.686]  And they gave it all over into the city consortium, the mayor left, opened his own land bank, now he's a state senator, and they control the land, and it's nothing but $5 million houses on it, and luxury hotels and salons and high-rises, and they just built the whole thing up.
[02:28:17.686 --> 02:28:24.329]  And they just go, we have cops with machine guns, there's nothing you can do.
[02:28:24.329 --> 02:28:27.171]  Now, somebody like
[02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:34.523]  Oh, who's the giant blubber creature?
[02:28:34.523 --> 02:28:35.103]  Michael Moore.
[02:28:35.103 --> 02:28:37.786]  I was having a Freudian block there.
[02:28:37.786 --> 02:28:50.335]  Somebody like the self-propelled blubber butt, who has got hundreds of millions of dollars, is a lying scumbag, hypocrite, globalist, and knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:28:50.335 --> 02:28:53.878]  I'm going to call him out on the other side and break down what's really happening in Wisconsin.
[02:28:55.404 --> 02:29:09.554]  You know, it turns out Blubber Blub has, and I remembered this in the news years ago, but I looked up this morning and there it was, Blubber Blub has made his films in different states where he can avoid the union rates.
[02:29:09.554 --> 02:29:18.921]  Blubber, Blubber Boy, and I'm not making fun of his obeisance, I'm a little overweight, I'm making fun of his psychic obeisance, his hypocrisy.
[02:29:23.752 --> 02:29:33.716]  This guy came out, owned massive amounts of stock in Halliburton and defense contractors knowingly ahead of the Iraq War.
[02:29:33.716 --> 02:29:35.297]  While he was bad-mouthing them.
[02:29:35.297 --> 02:29:38.298]  Folks, you know how, I know what to invest in.
[02:29:38.298 --> 02:29:42.300]  Prison companies, bioengineering, police state.
[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:45.321]  I don't invest in it because I'm not a hypocritical bloodsucker.
[02:29:45.321 --> 02:29:49.262]  Anyways, we're going to come back and break down what's really happening with all of this straight ahead.
[02:29:49.262 --> 02:29:50.203]  Then it goes into the energy.
[02:29:51.158 --> 02:29:55.087]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.087 --> 02:29:57.773]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.007 --> 02:30:04.828]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:30:04.828 --> 02:30:09.109]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:30:09.109 --> 02:30:13.929]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:30:13.929 --> 02:30:19.750]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:26.892]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:30:29.703 --> 02:30:36.429]  We're American and be proud.
[02:30:36.429 --> 02:30:39.391]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:30:55.504 --> 02:31:00.054]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:09.064]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:31:09.064 --> 02:31:11.745]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:31:11.745 --> 02:31:20.790]  Ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:29.035]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:31:29.035 --> 02:31:29.855]  Move quickly while
[02:31:29.855 --> 02:31:33.956]  Well, you can still afford it, and eFoodsDirect will pay your shipping costs for you.

[02:32:04.562 --> 02:32:05.823]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.823 --> 02:32:09.766]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.766 --> 02:32:12.168]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.168 --> 02:32:17.853]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.853 --> 02:32:24.098]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.518 --> 02:32:30.463]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.463 --> 02:32:34.666]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.666 --> 02:32:38.970]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.970 --> 02:32:44.915]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.915 --> 02:32:48.478]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.478 --> 02:32:50.459]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.459 --> 02:32:50.880]  It's here.

[02:33:01.028 --> 02:33:06.692]  Once you stand for nothing, they can program you and make you who they want you to be.
[02:33:06.692 --> 02:33:07.993]  An easy-to-run-over slave.
[02:33:07.993 --> 02:33:10.815]  Now Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along,
[02:33:20.183 --> 02:33:25.726]  Everyone knew him, knew each side that he'd be on.
[02:33:25.726 --> 02:33:31.109]  He never was a hero, for this town he shined like.
[02:33:31.109 --> 02:33:37.712]  But you could always find him standing up, for what he thought was right.
[02:33:37.712 --> 02:33:44.155]  He'd say, you've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything.
[02:33:44.155 --> 02:33:49.218]  You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string.
[02:33:52.185 --> 02:33:53.666]  We're good to go.
[02:34:09.734 --> 02:34:17.579]  He'd say you've got to stand for something Are you up for anything?
[02:34:47.228 --> 02:34:49.110]  Back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:35:02.745 --> 02:35:10.411]  Now continuing here, look, it's so simple but it's also so complex because they know how humans operate, the social engineers.
[02:35:10.411 --> 02:35:12.153]  The economy's falling apart.
[02:35:12.153 --> 02:35:15.095]  They're lying, telling us it's getting better.
[02:35:15.095 --> 02:35:17.477]  Government employees are out of control in many cases.
[02:35:17.477 --> 02:35:19.479]  They are spoiled in many cases.
[02:35:19.479 --> 02:35:22.661]  The unions are corrupt in many cases.
[02:35:22.661 --> 02:35:25.383]  The middle class is tired of being overtaxed.
[02:35:25.383 --> 02:35:28.146]  They're sick of being squeezed by the government for more money.
[02:35:29.875 --> 02:35:35.760]  They see the incredibly arrogant statements of the union people, and they say, shut them down.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:37.862]  Take everything they got.
[02:35:37.862 --> 02:35:38.663]  Cut their pay.
[02:35:38.663 --> 02:35:39.543]  Cut their healthcare.
[02:35:39.543 --> 02:35:43.147]  And that is what's happening here.
[02:35:43.147 --> 02:35:46.890]  And Michael Moore comes out and says, hey!
[02:35:49.907 --> 02:35:51.569]  And we don't have time to play his whole speech.
[02:35:51.569 --> 02:35:53.551]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:35:53.551 --> 02:36:00.840]  The headline from Curt Nemo is, Michael Moore's communist rhetoric distracts from larger issue of banksters' criminal activity.
[02:36:02.031 --> 02:36:04.752]  And it's got his whole speech from yesterday up there.
[02:36:04.752 --> 02:36:11.114]  And it's got other bizarre statements by people at the rallies, you know, saying, hey, you don't have a right to your own money.
[02:36:11.114 --> 02:36:13.454]  That means you don't have a right to your own body.
[02:36:13.454 --> 02:36:15.735]  And that's what's so evil about collectivism.
[02:36:15.735 --> 02:36:24.157]  Once you have it, there's an army of people that think that they are owed more and more and more of what you got.
[02:36:24.157 --> 02:36:30.459]  And it doesn't matter if 80 plus percent of the money that's been stolen from you went offshore.
[02:36:32.881 --> 02:36:37.202]  The big hordes of union people, they're being told, hey, you want your job?
[02:36:37.202 --> 02:36:38.062]  You want more money?
[02:36:38.062 --> 02:36:39.682]  You wanna keep your paycheck?
[02:36:39.682 --> 02:36:43.503]  Get it out of the private free market people's pocket.
[02:36:43.503 --> 02:36:59.927]  And so, you've got the big global banking cartel that owns the military industrial complex, and that owns our dominant mainstream media, and that manipulates and controls all these big teamsters unions, and the rest of them.
[02:37:01.553 --> 02:37:03.514]  And it's really very simple what's happening.
[02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:04.515]  It's divide and conquer.
[02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:08.578]  You got the globalists on top, you got the unions on the bottom, the unions mean well.
[02:37:08.578 --> 02:37:10.059]  That is their average.
[02:37:10.059 --> 02:37:17.043]  Members do, and it's too sophisticated for them to be able to understand even what's happening.
[02:37:17.043 --> 02:37:18.845]  They don't even understand what's happening.
[02:37:19.844 --> 02:37:20.684]  But it's very simple.
[02:37:20.684 --> 02:37:33.511]  What the banksters do in third world country after third world country and now in first world country after first world country is the banksters get the governments to basically buy into the derivatives failure of the bankers.
[02:37:33.511 --> 02:37:42.256]  The bankers use the derivatives on the way up to buy up the planet and the resources and then to put themselves into commodities and things that are safer.
[02:37:42.256 --> 02:37:47.419]  They leave the bad investments with the government pension funds, the private pension funds, and
[02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:54.324]  Other pension funds of smaller companies they don't control.
[02:37:54.324 --> 02:37:59.889]  Then, as the economy starts to go into freefall, they say, we've got to have cuts to government.
[02:37:59.889 --> 02:38:01.250]  We've got to balance the budget.
[02:38:04.244 --> 02:38:20.172]  But then they never discuss the record multi-hundred billion dollar bonuses being paid out for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Wells Fargo and Smith Barney and all the rest of the insiders.
[02:38:20.172 --> 02:38:21.613]  They're getting fatter.
[02:38:21.613 --> 02:38:23.594]  They're making the biggest profits ever.
[02:38:23.594 --> 02:38:25.955]  They engineered the end of Glass-Steagall.
[02:38:25.955 --> 02:38:27.516]  They sold to government.
[02:38:28.553 --> 02:38:31.494]  And your pension funds, these failed derivatives.
[02:38:31.494 --> 02:38:34.916]  And now they're holding us hostage, saying you've got to keep giving us more money.
[02:38:34.916 --> 02:38:37.177]  Now, I watched his whole 30-something minute speech.
[02:38:37.177 --> 02:38:40.058]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:38:40.058 --> 02:38:51.944]  And did Michael Moore, the guy who makes money off Halliburton and big defense contractors consciously while bad-mouthing wars, the guy who tries to do his films in areas where he can get around unions,
[02:38:53.598 --> 02:38:56.781]  The guy that goes along with the official story of 9-11.
[02:38:56.781 --> 02:39:01.725]  The guy that tried to have his bodyguards basically rough me up so I couldn't ask him questions.
[02:39:01.725 --> 02:39:13.496]  A hypocrite who made his whole life about going up and confronting media people and government people and putting them down if their bodyguards even touched him while his bodyguards were ramming their arms into my stomach.
[02:39:13.496 --> 02:39:14.297]  You know what I did?
[02:39:14.297 --> 02:39:15.358]  I just punched him right back.
[02:39:15.358 --> 02:39:16.418]  It's on video.
[02:39:16.418 --> 02:39:18.020]  Oh, you think you're a big tough guy, buddy?
[02:39:18.020 --> 02:39:18.721]  You just rammed into me?
[02:39:19.441 --> 02:39:20.443]  How do you like that?
[02:39:20.443 --> 02:39:22.666]  Now hit me in the face and see what happens, punk!
[02:39:22.666 --> 02:39:27.735]  I'm sorry, the point is, is that that guy is a hypocrite!
[02:39:31.087 --> 02:39:33.729]  He's a big fat bully and I'm sick of him!
[02:39:33.729 --> 02:39:37.972]  He's out there like a Pied Piper manipulating all those well-meaning union people.
[02:39:37.972 --> 02:39:45.497]  Those low-level union people have their dues stolen by the corrupt fat cat unions that are out there beating up Tea Partiers everywhere.
[02:39:45.497 --> 02:39:47.819]  And the Tea Partiers are being conned as well.
[02:39:47.819 --> 02:39:48.839]  But it's very simple.
[02:39:48.839 --> 02:39:55.124]  Michael Moore goes, there's 400 people who have more wealth than half the population of America.
[02:39:56.869 --> 02:39:58.270]  And that's true.
[02:39:58.270 --> 02:39:59.430]  That's a true number.
[02:39:59.430 --> 02:40:01.932]  And almost all of them are hedge fund managers.
[02:40:01.932 --> 02:40:08.675]  People that created trillions of dollars apiece in fake baloney, and then made the money off the top of it.
[02:40:08.675 --> 02:40:14.958]  I mean, I've seen hedge fund managers who are making six, seven, eight, nine billion a year.
[02:40:14.958 --> 02:40:22.042]  They set Greece up, not even owning the money to them, getting them to buy into derivatives, where it's like, oh, you owe me six billion at one hedge fund manager.
[02:40:22.042 --> 02:40:23.383]  I want this island.
[02:40:23.383 --> 02:40:24.763]  They're like, okay, here's the island.
[02:40:24.763 --> 02:40:25.704]  He writes off the debt.
[02:40:26.954 --> 02:40:27.274]  Whoa!
[02:40:27.274 --> 02:40:29.236]  Whoa!
[02:40:29.236 --> 02:40:34.260]  But you don't say you're going after them because of the free market is bad.
[02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:42.927]  It's not the free market to have banker insiders buying off the government and having them set up insider sweetheart deals.
[02:40:42.927 --> 02:40:44.288]  Where you
[02:40:46.854 --> 02:40:52.781]  Get to create all this counterfeit money and then not get in trouble for it, instead get more power.
[02:40:52.781 --> 02:40:58.127]  So see, he's there saying the wealth of these 400 people is a national resource.
[02:40:59.488 --> 02:41:00.990]  And that you don't own that money.
[02:41:00.990 --> 02:41:02.071]  That's not your money.
[02:41:02.071 --> 02:41:03.313]  Folks, here's the issue.
[02:41:03.313 --> 02:41:10.441]  Those crowds don't understand that those 400 people, some of them actually made it through owning restaurant chains or car dealerships or sports teams.
[02:41:10.441 --> 02:41:15.607]  But of the 400, and if you look at the list of the top cream, it's mainly bankers engaged in fraud.
[02:41:15.607 --> 02:41:17.430]  Not your corner bank, the big mega banks.
[02:41:18.905 --> 02:41:20.706]  And most of it's offshore to begin with.
[02:41:20.706 --> 02:41:22.906]  They're not going to have any of their wealth taken.
[02:41:22.906 --> 02:41:33.911]  They are going to use that big horde of half the population, either on welfare or working for a union, or the defense contractors that are there fighting with them, talking about how they're on welfare.
[02:41:33.911 --> 02:41:36.331]  You're on warfare!
[02:41:36.331 --> 02:41:37.552]  That Eisenhower talked about.
[02:41:37.552 --> 02:41:38.872]  I mean, get real.
[02:41:38.872 --> 02:41:43.954]  More than half the world's defense budgets is the U.S.
[02:41:43.954 --> 02:41:45.575]  All the other countries can't even add up.
[02:41:46.448 --> 02:41:47.788]  See, you gotta love the irony of that.
[02:41:47.788 --> 02:41:49.849]  The guy they're saying doesn't have a right to protest.
[02:41:49.849 --> 02:41:52.750]  The guy they tell, hey, I have a right to your money.
[02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:54.930]  You don't have a right to your money.
[02:41:54.930 --> 02:41:57.691]  He's a defense contractor.
[02:41:57.691 --> 02:42:01.152]  And I'm not saying you're inherently evil if you're an engineer and that's what you do.
[02:42:01.152 --> 02:42:02.793]  That's the only job anyways for you.
[02:42:02.793 --> 02:42:05.513]  The point is, buddy, you're living off my tax money too!
[02:42:05.513 --> 02:42:06.754]  And I'm sick of it!
[02:42:06.754 --> 02:42:07.854]  I'm sick of all of ya!
[02:42:09.758 --> 02:42:13.980]  Now, the banksters are getting upwards of 80% of all the money.
[02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:17.581]  The welfare moms, the union people, they're getting around 20% of it.
[02:42:17.581 --> 02:42:22.063]  My point is, you're rearranging chairs on the Titanic deck.
[02:42:22.063 --> 02:42:36.229]  Having all of us fight with each other out there, and there's the globalist move, having their Judas goat, their deceiver, up there with stuff written in a third grade level, talking to them about, it's not their money, it's your money!
[02:42:36.229 --> 02:42:37.570]  Yay!
[02:42:38.786 --> 02:42:44.309]  Because it's not going to be the 400 people who have as much wealth as 50% of the country.
[02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:48.212]  It's going to be those 400 people robbing the other 49.9%.
[02:42:48.212 --> 02:42:50.973]  See, he didn't say those 400 have more than all the country.
[02:42:50.973 --> 02:42:51.554]  He said 50%.
[02:42:51.554 --> 02:42:53.795]  Yeah, 50% who on average are making about $30,000 a year less.
[02:42:59.997 --> 02:43:00.397]  No, no.
[02:43:00.397 --> 02:43:04.099]  The target is the people making $100,000, $300,000, a million a year.
[02:43:04.099 --> 02:43:05.500]  They got the boat slips.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:06.580]  They go to your restaurants.
[02:43:06.580 --> 02:43:07.721]  They buy the clothes.
[02:43:07.721 --> 02:43:09.582]  They make the economy go, folks.
[02:43:09.582 --> 02:43:13.143]  And the globalists are targeting them because once they knock them out, it's over.
[02:43:13.143 --> 02:43:15.965]  And the middle class is disappearing right now.
[02:43:15.965 --> 02:43:19.306]  That's the fat buffalo that the general public feeds off of.
[02:43:19.306 --> 02:43:21.407]  The fat buffalo is dying.
[02:43:21.407 --> 02:43:24.529]  The globalists are just cutting out their tongues.
[02:43:24.529 --> 02:43:26.810]  That's all they're doing for buffalo tongue sandwich.
[02:43:28.186 --> 02:43:30.167]  They're wiping them out right now.
[02:43:30.167 --> 02:43:35.491]  Just like the globalists wiped out the buffalo to make the Plains Indians die.
[02:43:35.491 --> 02:43:36.952]  Scorched Earth policy.
[02:43:36.952 --> 02:43:39.213]  The globalists are wiping out the middle class.
[02:43:39.213 --> 02:43:40.194]  They always do it.
[02:43:40.194 --> 02:43:41.755]  It's in their handbooks.
[02:43:41.755 --> 02:43:43.236]  I want to play this quick clip.
[02:43:43.236 --> 02:43:52.882]  Here is, and it's up on InfoWorks, we want to see the full thing, of the union people with their big union sign saying, you don't have a right to your own money.
[02:43:52.882 --> 02:43:57.526]  I mean, this, this is incredible that this type of stuff is going on.
[02:43:57.526 --> 02:43:57.846]  Here it is.
[02:43:59.349 --> 02:44:01.471]  I'm not trying to beat you up.
[02:44:01.471 --> 02:44:05.994]  I'm not trying to just show you that I hate you, and that I'm just an arrogant bastard.
[02:44:05.994 --> 02:44:09.717]  Well, I don't hate you, and I'm not beating you up right now, as everybody can see.
[02:44:09.717 --> 02:44:13.260]  Actually, your only stated goal is that I go away.
[02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:18.404]  I want you to go away from these people who have rights to stop what they're taking.
[02:44:18.404 --> 02:44:19.104]  I do too.
[02:44:19.104 --> 02:44:23.548]  And what I'm saying is that their rights are infringing on my rights, and I'd like them to stop that.
[02:44:23.548 --> 02:44:24.268]  What's her right?
[02:44:24.268 --> 02:44:26.910]  Every dollar that I have to pay in taxes.
[02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:28.932]  Why do you have a right to your money?
[02:44:33.357 --> 02:44:38.783]  I don't have time to play at all.
[02:44:38.783 --> 02:44:48.293]  Then they have a debate about how he doesn't have a right to his own money, and like a bunch of lobotomized chickens hopping around, the mindless union people go, I'll get your money!
[02:44:48.293 --> 02:44:49.314]  Your money mine!
[02:44:49.314 --> 02:44:49.755]  Mine!
[02:44:49.755 --> 02:44:50.195]  Mine!
[02:44:50.195 --> 02:44:50.556]  Mine!
[02:44:51.283 --> 02:44:55.828]  And then the big defense contractor slides over, who does look like he's actually intelligent.
[02:44:55.828 --> 02:44:57.609]  He goes, well, I built something that's needed.
[02:44:57.609 --> 02:44:58.330]  I make more money.
[02:44:58.330 --> 02:45:00.132]  I'm a defense contractor.
[02:45:00.132 --> 02:45:02.094]  You still live off my money, pal.
[02:45:02.094 --> 02:45:03.375]  Get your hand out of my pocket.
[02:45:04.423 --> 02:45:07.744]  Oh, but America's good and the defense contractors are good, yeah.
[02:45:07.744 --> 02:45:10.264]  The whole Pentagon system trying to take our guns.
[02:45:10.264 --> 02:45:11.684]  What always overthrows countries?
[02:45:11.684 --> 02:45:12.985]  Its own military.
[02:45:12.985 --> 02:45:14.385]  Wake up, pal!
[02:45:14.385 --> 02:45:15.685]  All of you make me sick.
[02:45:15.685 --> 02:45:17.586]  And in that clip, everything's illustrated.
[02:45:17.586 --> 02:45:19.426]  They're all on government payroll.
[02:45:19.426 --> 02:45:20.946]  Even the private sector ones.
[02:45:20.946 --> 02:45:26.728]  The union slugs, the defense contractors slug, who's a total hypocrite.
[02:45:26.728 --> 02:45:28.688]  You're a total sickening hypocrite.
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:30.921]  You're probably making $100,000, $200,000 a year.
[02:45:30.921 --> 02:45:37.684]  You got some union guy making $30,000 a year who wants to keep his benefits, and you're self-righteously in his face.
[02:45:37.684 --> 02:45:42.746]  Sure, he's a mindless, lobotomized, fluoride head who probably can't even tie his shoelaces.
[02:45:42.746 --> 02:45:46.968]  He's so dumb, he thinks you don't have a right to your own money.
[02:45:46.968 --> 02:45:50.189]  You do have a right to your money if you earned it in the free market, pal.
[02:45:50.189 --> 02:45:53.451]  Not out of my pocket with tax money.
[02:45:53.451 --> 02:45:55.311]  So who's more guilty?
[02:45:55.311 --> 02:45:57.973]  But it's exactly what Michael Moore's doing.
[02:45:57.973 --> 02:45:58.693]  Do you understand it?
[02:45:59.915 --> 02:46:07.919]  He works for the banksters, sicking this giant horde of people that are about to have their jobs cut or lose their jobs or have their pay cut.
[02:46:07.919 --> 02:46:12.761]  They're out there chanting, it's our money, take the middle class's money, they're rich!
[02:46:12.761 --> 02:46:16.663]  And they're gonna come destroy what's left of the middle class.
[02:46:16.663 --> 02:46:20.905]  This is what happens when you have a giant domesticated mob on government payroll.
[02:46:20.905 --> 02:46:22.806]  When you have a democracy that
[02:46:24.286 --> 02:46:27.327]  Michael Slugmore calls for.
[02:46:27.327 --> 02:46:29.788]  51% vote to take your property.
[02:46:29.788 --> 02:46:34.250]  And then when things break down under a communist system, the Commissars then put you in forced labor.
[02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:36.131]  Because you're lazy.
[02:46:36.131 --> 02:46:39.212]  You need to now work for the greater state.
[02:46:39.212 --> 02:46:43.334]  Now, I'm going to talk more about this tomorrow.
[02:46:43.334 --> 02:46:47.936]  I got running late, but something that dovetails with all of this here
[02:46:49.622 --> 02:46:50.984]  Look, it's simple.
[02:46:50.984 --> 02:46:53.347]  It's not the governor good, the unions bad.
[02:46:53.347 --> 02:47:03.721]  No, it's unions controlled and bad, governor controlled and bad, getting us to end fight down here instead of talking about the 1.5 quadrillion derivatives, the black hole that's impossible to pay off.
[02:47:04.622 --> 02:47:11.964]  All we're doing is cutting now the welfare state, which is terrible and domesticates us, so that whatever's left of that can be paid to the bankers.
[02:47:11.964 --> 02:47:20.806]  And so they can rile up the welfare state into a politically mobilized army to come rob the rest of us, and then the welfare state will get a paltry sum of it, the rest will be transferred to the bankers.
[02:47:20.806 --> 02:47:23.466]  The bankers are just getting their horde ready.
[02:47:23.466 --> 02:47:28.708]  When the military-industrial complex doesn't get their welfare, they blow up buildings in Manhattan.
[02:47:28.708 --> 02:47:30.588]  The unions just go out and start protesting.
[02:47:32.022 --> 02:47:32.664]  You understand that?
[02:47:32.664 --> 02:47:36.955]  When a military industrial complex wants to take over America, they bomb Oklahoma City.
[02:47:36.955 --> 02:47:38.900]  When they want to take over the world, they blow up the World Trade Center.
[02:47:40.305 --> 02:47:43.766]  I'm sick of all of you and all your welfare ruining this country.
[02:47:43.766 --> 02:48:04.415]  All right, now, for the rest of this segment and the next, Aaron Dykes came to me and he said, you know, you made that video, and I didn't, I understood it, but I didn't quite get it about they're shutting down the power plant so that select companies make the money, but then today with Lord Monckton, he really got it, and he printed off a bunch of documents from his deep research, because sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees.
[02:48:04.415 --> 02:48:06.036]  Aaron, break down your synopsis.
[02:48:07.243 --> 02:48:11.245]  Yeah, and additionally I was watching the documentary Enron, the smartest guys in the room.
[02:48:11.245 --> 02:48:15.207]  It's been out since 2005, before those guys went on trial.
[02:48:15.207 --> 02:48:29.913]  But if you set aside the whole larger pump and dump scheme that they did, one of the main things Enron did was use California's deregulation to instill rolling blackouts so they could completely monopolize and profit from it.
[02:48:30.593 --> 02:48:33.816]  That's on record to teach people about artificial scarcity.
[02:48:33.816 --> 02:48:35.317]  Oh, there must not be enough power.
[02:48:35.317 --> 02:48:36.278]  I better pay more.
[02:48:36.278 --> 02:48:39.841]  They'd rather sell you one hour than 24 hours at a higher price.
[02:48:39.841 --> 02:48:41.002]  And they were never out of power.
[02:48:41.002 --> 02:48:42.223]  They just manipulated it.
[02:48:42.223 --> 02:48:50.350]  It's admitted they used the traders and marketers to drive up the system, going from about $12 billion in power in the first quarter of 2000 to $48 billion in the first quarter of 2001.
[02:48:53.232 --> 02:48:54.333]  That's on Wikipedia.
[02:48:54.333 --> 02:48:57.376]  That's just one of the basic introduction sources.
[02:48:57.376 --> 02:49:05.684]  But the point is, Ken Lay and these other Enron and bankers and Goldman Sachs types were not just involved in their own company schemes.
[02:49:05.684 --> 02:49:10.469]  They helped set up the Cap-and-Trade system, which has a complete... They're on record!
[02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:18.056]  This is not a conspiracy theory with Al Gore saying we're going to claim environmentalism, we're going to shut down all our competition and make a hundred times the profit.
[02:49:18.436 --> 02:49:41.270]  And I have that clip, maybe we can play it when we come back from break, but Ken Lay was on the Presidential Council for Sustainable Development, Agenda 21, under the Clinton administration in 93 with a bunch of other familiar players setting up, you know, the cap-and-trade system we know today to instill rolling blackouts, as we saw in Texas, and they're doing the same thing in England and other places.
[02:49:41.730 --> 02:49:41.850]  It's
[02:50:00.715 --> 02:50:02.857]  Reducing power, shutting down all their competition.
[02:50:21.893 --> 02:50:22.214]  I don't
[02:50:36.664 --> 02:50:39.606]  The truth is the free market would make everybody wealthy.
[02:50:39.606 --> 02:50:44.030]  We see how the insiders are in there always with crony capitalism.
[02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:46.932]  Then they scapegoat crony capitalism.
[02:50:46.932 --> 02:50:49.854]  They scapegoat capitalism with crony capitalism.
[02:50:49.854 --> 02:50:55.739]  And then blame capitalism itself and bring in total socialism to take our wealth transferred to them offshore.
[02:50:55.739 --> 02:50:58.321]  That's the big secret and that's what Michael Moore is doing.
[02:50:58.321 --> 02:51:01.123]  He's offering socialism as the solution when it's the problem.
[02:51:01.503 --> 02:51:08.433]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[02:51:08.433 --> 02:51:14.401]  18 years ago, we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[02:51:14.401 --> 02:51:18.167]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[02:51:18.487 --> 02:51:20.289]  My wages were being garnished.

[02:53:01.050 --> 02:53:02.811]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[02:53:02.811 --> 02:53:04.152]  How would that make you feel?
[02:53:04.152 --> 02:53:05.874]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:53:05.874 --> 02:53:08.416]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:53:08.416 --> 02:53:15.981]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:53:15.981 --> 02:53:17.462]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:53:17.462 --> 02:53:20.224]  Don reports dramatic improvements with hardened body extract.
[02:53:20.224 --> 02:53:25.548]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:53:25.548 --> 02:53:30.552]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:53:30.752 --> 02:53:35.874]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[02:53:44.978 --> 02:53:48.359]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[02:53:48.359 --> 02:53:53.061]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:53.061 --> 02:53:56.522]  Details at hbextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:54:01.247 --> 02:54:13.143]  Back in 1997, when you were Vice President, Enron's CEO, Ken Lay, was involved in discussions with you at the White House about helping develop this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[02:54:13.143 --> 02:54:14.765]  Is that accurate?
[02:54:14.765 --> 02:54:15.586]  Is it inaccurate?
[02:54:15.586 --> 02:54:16.488]  It's been reported.
[02:54:19.256 --> 02:54:27.862]  I don't know, but I met with Ken Lay, as lots of people did before anybody knew that he was a pro.
[02:54:27.862 --> 02:54:38.810]  And clearly, you can see why so many of us are concerned about this type of cap and trade energy tax that would be literally turning over this country's energy economy.
[02:54:38.810 --> 02:54:40.451]  I didn't know him well enough to call him Kenny Boy.
[02:54:40.771 --> 02:54:51.042]  Well, but you knew him well enough to help devise this trading scheme, and obviously we know what Enron and these big guys on Wall Street like Goldman Sachs, and I know you've got interest with Goldman Sachs.
[02:54:51.042 --> 02:54:51.202]  No.
[02:54:51.202 --> 02:54:54.866]  These people, well, that's been reported, is that not accurate?
[02:54:54.866 --> 02:54:56.027]  No, I wish I did.
[02:54:56.027 --> 02:54:58.369]  With executives from, you're partnered in companies with...
[02:55:02.921 --> 02:55:09.024]  Now, we have the board of directors, we have the meetings, and look at who the players are today.
[02:55:09.024 --> 02:55:17.747]  It's the very same people that set this up in the mid-nineties with Al Gore, now running the government program to shut down all the power plants that they don't own and control.
[02:55:17.747 --> 02:55:22.649]  And Enron people went to jail for setting this up, and now they're doing the same scam in England.
[02:55:22.649 --> 02:55:24.730]  I mean, this has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:25.651]  These are crooks.
[02:55:25.651 --> 02:55:28.092]  They want to use big government just like Obama gives out.
[02:55:29.092 --> 02:55:32.815]  A thousand forty waivers to big corporations on insurance.
[02:55:32.815 --> 02:55:34.116]  You don't get the waiver.
[02:55:34.116 --> 02:55:36.398]  This is this is mafia where only they can do business.
[02:55:36.398 --> 02:55:37.138]  Aaron, go over.
[02:55:37.138 --> 02:55:44.383]  It's artificial scarcity using somewhat sophisticated systems like deregulation over a blackout power grid.
[02:55:44.383 --> 02:55:50.768]  But you saw it came up in Congress, how Al Gore and Ken Lay had a relationship back when he was vice president.
[02:55:50.768 --> 02:55:54.451]  You know, he partnered Blood and Gore, his carbon trading program,
[02:55:55.391 --> 02:55:56.772]  And he arrogantly denied it to her.
[02:55:56.772 --> 02:55:59.913]  The congressman almost backed off because it's so brazen.
[02:55:59.913 --> 02:56:00.494]  Absolutely.
[02:56:00.494 --> 02:56:01.574]  Go over the names.
[02:56:01.574 --> 02:56:19.222]  Yeah, some of the names from the Presidential Council on Sustainable Development from 93 in the Clinton administration included Ken Lay of Enron, the head of American Electric Power, the head of General Motors Corporation, the head of BP Amico at the time, the head of Dow Chemical at the time, SC Johnson and son.
[02:56:19.222 --> 02:56:20.223]  Oil companies run this.
[02:56:20.523 --> 02:56:22.285]  She's the one cutting the power plants off!
[02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:39.021]  And also William Daley, now Obama's brand new chief of staff.
[02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:41.162]  Mob boss, known mob family.
[02:56:41.162 --> 02:56:42.843]  Yeah, he's brother of the Chicago mayor.
[02:56:42.843 --> 02:56:44.604]  He helped set this up.
[02:56:44.604 --> 02:56:53.527]  And Dan Glickman, he was head of the USDA then, but he was also part of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, who set up the whole carbon... And it's simple.
[02:56:53.527 --> 02:56:58.409]  I mean, the old America was corrupt in ways, but at least power was power, and it was about getting you power.
[02:56:58.809 --> 02:57:03.091]  Now they just go, look, we'll give them one hour of power a day, triple charge them.
[02:57:03.091 --> 02:57:08.154]  I mean, the head of the British power system says, you won't get power most of the time, but you'll pay more.
[02:57:08.154 --> 02:57:09.815]  Why not if we put up with it?
[02:57:09.815 --> 02:57:15.738]  These Enron scammers shut down, instilled artificial blackouts, knowing it would drive up profits.
[02:57:15.738 --> 02:57:24.003]  What happened in Texas only a couple months ago, as you pointed out in the video, when they shut down for cap and trade or whatever excuse, it does one thing, it drives up prices.
[02:57:24.788 --> 02:57:33.773]  Austin has announced that they're going to double again in the next three years, $3.4 billion, excuse me, $3.4 billion, and it's all on record they're doing this.
[02:57:33.773 --> 02:57:36.195]  Thanks to you pointing that out, I've now read those documents.
[02:57:36.195 --> 02:57:41.098]  They targeted their carbon cuts for about twice of what was called for federally.
[02:57:41.098 --> 02:57:44.480]  No, I mean, Austin is run by a group of ab-folks.
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:46.301]  I'm not just saying this.
[02:57:46.301 --> 02:57:49.282]  Criminal, hardcore, mafia operatives.
[02:57:49.282 --> 02:57:51.003]  That's why your power bill used to be $200, it's $600.
[02:57:52.464 --> 02:57:53.845]  It used to be $1,000, it's $3,000.
[02:57:53.845 --> 02:57:56.787]  And they're just like, mafia, going, we're taking it!
[02:57:56.787 --> 02:57:59.029]  It's going to Kinley's people!
[02:57:59.029 --> 02:58:00.610]  Al Gore, shut up!
[02:58:00.610 --> 02:58:02.591]  We have SWAT teams ready to kill you!
[02:58:02.591 --> 02:58:06.634]  If you're in on the coverage- And the SWAT teams are just, got their weapons, just training to take on the American people.
[02:58:06.634 --> 02:58:11.918]  The Army's standing by, Threat Fusion Center's spying, they're robbing everything, taking the pension funds.
[02:58:11.918 --> 02:58:17.442]  The troops themselves are having their death benefits taken, and the troops just salute and go, I'm ready to kill Americans!
[02:58:17.442 --> 02:58:18.743]  Take my pension fund!
[02:58:18.743 --> 02:58:20.164]  I want to use DU!
[02:58:20.164 --> 02:58:20.824]  Use me!
[02:58:20.824 --> 02:58:21.284]  Yes, sir!
[02:58:22.105 --> 02:58:23.006]  Well, not me!
[02:58:23.006 --> 02:58:24.426]  I'm not into being used.
[02:58:24.426 --> 02:58:25.847]  I'm not into being a slave.
[02:58:25.847 --> 02:58:28.949]  Aaron, I want to continue with another report tomorrow in full detail.
[02:58:28.949 --> 02:58:31.811]  Maybe we should shoot a YouTube or PrisonPlanet.tv video.
[02:58:31.811 --> 02:58:33.352]  These people are scum.
[02:58:33.352 --> 02:58:34.272]  They are trash.
[02:58:34.272 --> 02:58:35.353]  They are enemies.
[02:58:35.353 --> 02:58:40.496]  And it's time to get angry and defeat them and to realize they are our enemies!
[02:58:40.496 --> 02:58:41.216]  Defeat them!
