[00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.688]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:11.270]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:21.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:46.983]  Thank you so much for joining us today, wherever you may be listening around the world, and however you may be listening, whether it's AM and FM, XM, shortwave, the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course all the viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:50.186]  We're obviously going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.690]  And we're gonna have open phones as well.
[00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:05.472]  I have quite a few vital stacks of news and information obviously here that we're going to be going over today.
[00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:12.674]  Dealing with so many huge issues, but there are some interesting articles out of Europe and also out of the Times of India.
[00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:15.895]  Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit.
[00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:29.350]  And it's interesting, we've been trying to get Ray McGovern on the last week, former CIA top analyst advisor to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, to talk about the Egypt situation.
[00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.253]  And we got a hold of him today to get him on and he said, well, I don't really want to get into that too much.
[00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:36.674]  People know what's happening there, but I'll talk about it.
[00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:39.196]  He said, I want to talk about the Bush arrest.
[00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:40.997]  News that just came out.
[00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:46.441]  It's funny because that's one of the reasons this morning that we redoubled our efforts to get him on.
[00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:54.927]  So perfect timing to have Ray McGovern on with us in the third hour today or coming up two hours from now.
[00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:58.050]  Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit.
[00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:05.038]  And it's funny because that's exactly what we were talking about last night at dinner.
[00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:13.184]  After the radio show ended a couple times a year, I like to treat, especially the Sunday crew that works six days a week, to dinner.
[00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:18.828]  And I asked where they wanted to go eat and they said, how about a downtown steakhouse?
[00:02:18.828 --> 00:02:22.691]  And it was a downtown steakhouse eight years ago that I got to see the Bush twins drunk.
[00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:31.143]  But that wasn't as interesting as what happened last night, who we saw last night at a steakhouse.
[00:02:31.143 --> 00:02:34.546]  We were gonna go to one steakhouse, but it's out of business now in this great economy.
[00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:37.249]  So many of the businesses are shut down.
[00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:42.833]  So we went to another steakhouse, and they sat us right down next to Karl Rove.
[00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:45.656]  He was just this far away from me.
[00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:51.281]  And I'll tell you how it ended coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:55.114]  But that was undoubtedly very, very interesting.
[00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:56.515]  It was pretty dark in the steakhouse.
[00:02:56.515 --> 00:03:03.561]  We did have one iPhone that shot some horrid video, my iPhone video.
[00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:05.863]  The lens is basically broken.
[00:03:05.863 --> 00:03:09.326]  It's fogged permanently because I got it partially wet a few months ago.
[00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.367]  I've just got to get a new one.
[00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:13.789]  I should never go anywhere without a camera.
[00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:19.213]  But I'll tell you what ended up happening with the whole Karl Rove situation.
[00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:37.462]  Obviously we'll continue to discuss the fact that on Friday evening, not only the George Soros media matters, but the White House itself responded to our PrisonPlanet.com article from Thursday about Obama policies dealing with energy triggering the rolling blackouts nationwide.
[00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:41.884]  And the White House did respond to that.
[00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:44.065]  So we know we're on the White House enemies list.
[00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:46.226]  That's been reported on by mainstream news.
[00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.987]  But this is a new level in them countering us.
[00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:54.729]  So certainly we need your prayers, all of you out there.
[00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.890]  Also, Obama has been in the last 30 minutes been giving a press conference.
[00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.752]  Or really a speech last press conference.
[00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:04.554]  Obama calls for bipartisan effort to fight for U.S.
[00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:09.037]  jobs while he tries to shut down our power plants and put the carbon taxes on us.
[00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:12.380]  See, we think of it as a president fighting for us.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.805]  The globalists that run our country like using our military to dominate the planet, and that's as far as their love of America goes.
[00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:20.146]  The rest is nothing but hatred.
[00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:26.054]  And the stated goal on record is the deindustrialization of this country.
[00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:29.396]  So I thought I would go over some of that.
[00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:32.178]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I will play it today.
[00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:40.123]  An interview on CNN, Bill Gates vaccine autism link an absolute lie, and he gave no proof.
[00:04:40.123 --> 00:04:46.368]  Also, we're going to be getting in to the latest situation and developments that are unfolding.
[00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:55.293]  In the Middle East and North Africa in Egypt and we're going to get it into the Huffington Post being bought by AOL.
[00:04:55.293 --> 00:04:56.574]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:57.015]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:04.625]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:05.546]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:08.968]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:09.828]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:14.711]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:15.451]  It's true.
[00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:20.334]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:21.154]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.736]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:28.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.638 --> 00:05:29.439]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.202]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:35.886]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:36.686]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:40.831]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:45.596]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:50.039]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.841]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:54.083]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:56.424]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:05.191]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:08.435]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:13.220]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.626]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:21.869]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:22.689]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:23.209]  Bernanke?
[00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.890]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.150]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.411]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:45.681]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.564]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:48.564 --> 00:06:57.692]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:05.562]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:14.424]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.424 --> 00:07:19.045]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:29.867]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.487 --> 00:07:40.009]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:45.431]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:52.932]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:55.673]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:04.005]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:06.816]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.602 --> 00:08:18.345]  It is Monday, the 7th day of February, 2011.
[00:08:18.345 --> 00:08:34.178]  Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst to George Herbert Walker Bush and Ronald Reagan, who of course famously confronted at a press conference Donald Rumsfeld about his lies about WMDs.
[00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:39.763]  He's going to be joining us to deal with Bush Fears Arrest, Scrapped Swiss Visit.
[00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.659]  Former U.S.
[00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:50.723]  President George W. Bush has reportedly cancelled a visit to Switzerland amid concerns that it could be arrested for allegedly authorizing the torture of prisoners.
[00:08:50.723 --> 00:08:51.684]  There's no allegedly.
[00:08:51.684 --> 00:09:00.348]  We have the White House memos ordering it and saying that Bush had ordered it from then Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez and John Yoo White House counsel.
[00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:09.155]  And of course, Cheney doesn't travel to many European countries like Spain because there have been indictments there as well.
[00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:19.460]  And Bush has openly, in the last six months, written a book about it and given two different speeches where he's bragged about ordering torture.
[00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:27.869]  And our media has tried to sell us that torture is cool and sexy and a great thing when we do it, but not when others do it.
[00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:31.831]  I mean, this is truly the American people being sold on evil.
[00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:36.333]  And so if the government can order things that are illegal, then the sky's the limit.
[00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:37.394]  Why not ship in drugs?
[00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:38.534]  Well, they do that.
[00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:40.835]  Why not run giant child kidnapping rings worldwide?
[00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:41.476]  Well, they do that.
[00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:47.280]  Why not steal veterans' death benefits, which they now admit they're doing?
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.301]  Why not go ahead and steal your pension funds?
[00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:57.927]  Why not go ahead and add things like uranium to the tap water, which Texas newspapers have been reporting on the last two months?
[00:09:57.927 --> 00:09:58.628]  Why not?
[00:09:58.628 --> 00:10:04.012]  Why not have the troops use depleted uranium that they know is going to basically soft-kill the troops?
[00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:07.795]  Why not, if it isn't illegal when the President does it?
[00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:10.156]  Remember what Nixon said.
[00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:10.536]  He said, well,
[00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:14.125]  It's not illegal when the president breaks the law.
[00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:17.387]  And that's what they argued under Bush for those eight years.
[00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:26.511]  And now the media has hailed Obama for continuing to do the same thing and say he's above the law and do things that are illegal and unconstitutional.
[00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:31.893]  And Cheney has recently praised Obama saying, now he sees that what we did was right.
[00:10:31.893 --> 00:10:35.515]  Continuing the torture, the secret arrest, all of it.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:46.367]  The drone attacks targeting quote unknown terrorist is well that guy's got a gun in Pakistan or Afghanistan go ahead and blow up that whole group of people there.
[00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:57.134]  This is incredible so we'll talk about that coming up with Ray McGovern in the third hour today will also pick his brain dealing with the whole situation in
[00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:01.573]  The Middle East and North Africa.
[00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:21.855]  And they're training private security guards, the police, you name it, how to be basically secret police.
[00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:24.336]  New report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:11:24.336 --> 00:11:26.538]  Some good news on the police state front.
[00:11:26.538 --> 00:11:28.559]  Two of five FCC commissioners.
[00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:31.561]  FCC doesn't have legal authority to regulate the Internet.
[00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:37.985]  The problem is the FCC is still declaring that they are taking over the Internet and have the power to control it.
[00:11:37.985 --> 00:11:39.987]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:11:39.987 --> 00:11:44.070]  Obviously, if you didn't join us yesterday, you don't know about it.
[00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.191]  But obviously, if you did join us, you know about it.
[00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:57.039]  Fox News, Drudge Report, Rush Limbaugh, Media Matters, and a whole bunch of other publications on the control left and right.
[00:11:58.137 --> 00:12:02.440]  I wouldn't say Drudge is on the control left or right, but certainly Fox News is.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:14.648]  But Media Matters and others on Friday came out and attacked us for our Thursday report dealing with Obama's blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts.
[00:12:14.648 --> 00:12:21.313]  The White House responded Friday afternoon with a press release by Dan Pfeiffer, White House Communications Director.
[00:12:21.773 --> 00:12:26.234]  And I went through that yesterday, but I'll be recapping the latest developments on that front.
[00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:27.974]  We have our counter story to it.
[00:12:27.974 --> 00:12:32.715]  White House attacks, PrisonPlanet.com report on blackouts.
[00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:45.157]  Also, the Heritage Foundation concurred with our analysis and did point out that Drudge's top storyline for the morning featured the connection to Obama's policies and blackouts.
[00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:47.078]  Again, linking through to what we were covering.
[00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:50.239]  There, we're going to be going over all of that.
[00:12:50.239 --> 00:13:02.122]  And the so-called global warming, Al Gore, of course, last week and then again today, is saying in press releases that this is global warming causing these extremely cold temperatures across the United States.
[00:13:02.122 --> 00:13:08.244]  Mexico, 35 zoo animals are froze to death in northern Mexico because they're just not prepared for it.
[00:13:08.244 --> 00:13:13.386]  Also, northern Mexico, cold snap paralyzes Juarez.
[00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:16.567]  So those are just some of the reports that we have.
[00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:17.848]  I don't
[00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:52.858]  And yes, the poles of the planet have moved and are always moving a little bit, but now they're moving a lot more than they've been recorded in the last 80 years or so, since the 1920s, when the establishment, the scientific establishment around 1910, 1920, you see the studies begin following the poles.
[00:13:52.858 --> 00:13:53.659]  They really only got about 50,
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.401]  We're good to go.
[00:14:16.236 --> 00:14:31.849]  And there is some evidence to that, that it's confirmed it's shifted quite a bit compared to previous readings, but it's not like a complete flip where suddenly the poll is in, you know, South Africa and Brazil.
[00:14:33.587 --> 00:14:34.208]  We're good to go!
[00:14:58.632 --> 00:14:59.633]  Twelve years or so.
[00:15:18.706 --> 00:15:42.779]  I'll spend 10 minutes or so next hour getting into Pulse Shift and you're welcome to call in and talk about Pulse Shift or even more importantly big changes that are always going on in the sun and its magnetic field bathing the earth in solar radiation, the main driver obviously of the climate of the planet even though the UN says the sun has no effect on climate or weather.
[00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:46.928]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I'm happy to sell you on the moon.
[00:15:46.928 --> 00:15:50.430]  Magnetic polar shifts causing massive global super storms.
[00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.510]  And here's Fox News.
[00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:56.093]  Magnetic north pole shifts forces runway closures at Florida airport.
[00:15:57.433 --> 00:16:04.137]  Continuing, we'll go over the overall cataclysmic pulse shift hypothesis and what people are saying.
[00:16:04.137 --> 00:16:04.757]  Here's another one.
[00:16:04.757 --> 00:16:07.439]  Scientists give human extinction warning.
[00:16:07.439 --> 00:16:08.179]  Here's another one.
[00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:13.442]  Why is BGS reestablishing a magnetic observatory on South Georgia?
[00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.833]  That's out of the British Geological Survey.
[00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:19.954]  Also, a report here from NASA.
[00:16:19.954 --> 00:16:24.016]  Magnetic portals connect Earth to the Sun.
[00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:26.657]  Satellites spy changes to Earth's magnetic field.
[00:16:26.657 --> 00:16:28.498]  Scientific American.
[00:16:28.498 --> 00:16:30.680]  This is just some of what we're going to be covering.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.362]  And I think the bottom line here is, we don't know what's happening.
[00:16:34.362 --> 00:16:37.883]  Change is the only constant in this universe.
[00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:40.185]  And hence, on terra firma, our little
[00:16:41.005 --> 00:16:47.208]  Blue Green Jewel orbiting the Sun two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:57.032]  And I wonder if we could pay Al Gore or the UN or the Rothschilds a tax and they'll wave a magic wand and stop any pole shifts from happening.
[00:16:57.032 --> 00:16:59.373]  Or asteroids from hitting us.
[00:16:59.373 --> 00:17:07.196]  Or the Sun shooting out a massive coronal ejection directly at the Earth and blowing out all of our communications.
[00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:08.377]  And we know these events happen.
[00:17:09.602 --> 00:17:13.743]  We know the cataclysmic asteroid impacts happen routinely.
[00:17:13.743 --> 00:17:18.564]  They estimate now, not every million years or so, but perhaps every 10,000 years.
[00:17:18.564 --> 00:17:25.226]  And that's why many other previous human civilizations, going back over 6,000 years, just disappeared.
[00:17:25.226 --> 00:17:26.386]  I don't know.
[00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:28.646]  Do we have the technology to put weapons systems in space?
[00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:29.387]  Stop it.
[00:17:29.387 --> 00:17:29.987]  Probably.
[00:17:29.987 --> 00:17:35.088]  But the establishment will then just use those and wheel those guns around, those missiles, around on the Earth.
[00:17:36.081 --> 00:17:44.432]  And the globalists have been caught admitting they want to use an anti-asteroid weapon system as a cover for further weaponizing space.
[00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:47.556]  So these are all issues we deal with, but that's just part of life.
[00:17:47.556 --> 00:17:49.338]  Driving down the highway is dangerous.
[00:17:49.338 --> 00:17:51.280]  Swimming in a swimming pool or a lake is dangerous.
[00:17:51.801 --> 00:17:54.903]  Walking around, you know, in the woods is dangerous.
[00:17:54.903 --> 00:17:59.165]  You could, you know, get attacked by a bear or a wolf or a rattlesnake.
[00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:09.051]  Anytime the government tells you that you should not ever be in any danger and that they're going to protect you, A, under law they don't have to protect you, B, historically they don't want to protect you, they want to feed off of you,
[00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:15.891]  And it's like that woman I covered two weeks ago here in Austin getting a $48,000 settlement with Travis County.
[00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:21.917]  She's out with a bike riding group on a rural, one-lane, each-way, two-lane road.
[00:18:21.917 --> 00:18:29.004]  She's on the shoulder, the broken shoulder, and flips off the bike and broke her jaw, and they settled with her.
[00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:34.109]  You know, the message is, you fall off your bicycle, you sue the government.
[00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:41.242]  Or, oh my gosh, the sea levels are going to rise from carbon dioxide, which by the way, they're not rising.
[00:18:41.242 --> 00:18:43.703]  Let's pay Al Gore some money.
[00:18:43.703 --> 00:18:46.385]  It's a joke.
[00:18:46.385 --> 00:18:51.029]  So I'm going to get into that coming up as well.
[00:18:51.029 --> 00:19:00.576]  But the first thing I want to get to when we come back from break, because I mentioned it earlier at the kickoff of the transmission, is that
[00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:15.974]  George W. Bush, it is confirmed, was to be the keynote speaker, former President George W. Bush, at an event in Switzerland, and it's cancelled due to fears that he may be arrested.
[00:19:15.974 --> 00:19:25.960]  Or that there's going to be scenes there, and that a local magistrate may try to have him arrested, and then he'll have to use diplomatic power to block it, and that will further focus people on his admitted crimes.
[00:19:28.027 --> 00:19:37.611]  And it's funny because we were discussing people being arrested for torture and admittedly ordering torture that's illegal and other war crimes last night.
[00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:48.234]  The reason it popped up in our debate was we went out to eat after the radio show and Karl Rove is in town and they sat us down two feet from him.
[00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:49.575]  Karl Rove was right over my shoulder.
[00:19:49.575 --> 00:19:51.476]  I could reach out and touch him and
[00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:55.877]  He was gibbering and giggling like a goblin.
[00:19:55.877 --> 00:20:01.178]  I mean, it was literally like I was sitting next to Satan.

[00:21:01.522 --> 00:21:08.603]  If you are going through a financial rollercoaster because of your investment in stocks, bonds and other paper assets, perhaps you're ready for a change.
[00:21:08.603 --> 00:21:11.804]  You have an opportunity to change your financial security.

[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.740]  686-2237-extension-178.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:46.242]  Take action today when we are still accepting paper dollars for gold and silver.
[00:21:46.242 --> 00:21:47.523]  Ready for a change?
[00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:49.803]  Call Roger Raw at 1-800-686-2237-extension-178.
[00:21:49.803 --> 00:21:50.764]  Again it's 1-800-686-2237-extension-178.
[00:21:59.324 --> 00:22:00.505]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:07.471]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:22:07.471 --> 00:22:10.034]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:22:10.034 --> 00:22:15.458]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:18.401]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:20.463]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:22:20.703 --> 00:22:27.007]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:22:27.007 --> 00:22:30.390]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:36.214]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:22:36.214 --> 00:22:37.855]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:22:37.855 --> 00:22:39.176]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:22:39.176 --> 00:22:41.858]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:22:41.858 --> 00:22:43.279]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:22:43.539 --> 00:22:45.881]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:22:59.232 --> 00:23:01.074]  Looking for the ultimate superfood?
[00:23:01.074 --> 00:23:05.960]  One that will give you lasting energy, improve your sense of well-being, and help you build lean muscle?
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.266]  One World Way is the first ever unheated whey protein powder on the market.
[00:23:10.266 --> 00:23:13.570]  Virtually all other whey protein powders on the market are heated.
[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.695]  This damages 15% or more of the proteins, making them unusable to the body.
[00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:22.556]  Fresh raw whey has been used for hundreds of years to alleviate many health problems.
[00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:26.877]  The life-giving properties in raw whey are now available in One World Whey.
[00:23:26.877 --> 00:23:35.880]  Whether you want to build immunity, strength, endurance, muscles, slow down aging, or just feel a lot better, One World Whey may be the perfect food for you.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.281]  One World Whey is also an ideal emergency preparedness food.
[00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:45.022]  Simply mix with water and you'll have a delicious, life-giving, protein food in vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry.
[00:23:45.022 --> 00:23:46.743]  For your free report on the benefits
[00:23:47.023 --> 00:23:51.887]  Okay, I'll get into the latest developments on Egypt, the economy, the Huffington Post being bought by AOL.
[00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:17.554]  The police state developments at the Super Bowl and a lot more coming up and your phone calls.
[00:24:17.554 --> 00:24:24.059]  I'd love to hear from you on any issue you'd like to discuss.
[00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:25.060]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.501]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:26.501 --> 00:24:32.066]  So two or three times a year, I like to take the Sunday crew out to eat.
[00:24:32.066 --> 00:24:37.371]  And we just, on off chance, I said, hey, we're not watching the Super Bowl.
[00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:38.852]  And my wife's out doing stuff with the kids.
[00:24:38.852 --> 00:24:39.853]  I said, let's go eat.
[00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:40.814]  I said, what do you guys want to eat?
[00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:42.922]  My sister's a vegetarian.
[00:24:42.922 --> 00:24:45.925]  She didn't want to, you know, go eat steak, so she didn't go.
[00:24:45.925 --> 00:24:52.492]  But the rest of us went and we went try to go to one place, but it's closed because the economy is so great.
[00:24:52.492 --> 00:24:56.937]  And so we said, well, let's let's try this steakhouse or should we try that steakhouse?
[00:24:56.937 --> 00:24:58.478]  And we said, we haven't been there.
[00:24:58.478 --> 00:25:00.981]  Let's go there.
[00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:02.682]  So we go in.
[00:25:04.361 --> 00:25:24.015]  And because we hadn't been there in a while and the place is about a third full and on one end of the dining area there's a table by itself with some folks at it and they walk us over and sit us down and then I look because I hear gibbering behind me.
[00:25:24.015 --> 00:25:26.297]  It was four of us at a table.
[00:25:27.461 --> 00:25:30.082]  And I was seated with my back to Karl Rove.
[00:25:30.082 --> 00:25:31.462]  I didn't recognize him when I sat down.
[00:25:31.462 --> 00:25:34.303]  He was right behind me, sitting right here.
[00:25:34.303 --> 00:25:37.264]  And I literally hear, like, demonic gibbering.
[00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:50.087]  Like, if I tried to do an evil laugh, it was like... And if I was thinking, I could have at least recorded it with my iPhone, even though my camera is somewhat broken on it.
[00:25:50.087 --> 00:25:52.428]  Like I said, I got it wet, so it's all fogged up.
[00:25:52.428 --> 00:25:54.128]  But it shoots audio.
[00:25:54.128 --> 00:25:55.289]  And I was asking the other guys,
[00:25:57.054 --> 00:25:57.194]  One of
[00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.391]  We're good.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.044]  The jibbering just went on and on and on, and Aaron Dykes was there.
[00:26:35.044 --> 00:26:38.067]  He was up here working on a story, so he went with us.
[00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:49.219]  And Aaron, if you remember, I don't know, eight, nine months ago, and the case is still pending, Aaron got arrested for asking Karl Rove a question at a UT speech during the question and answer.
[00:26:50.331 --> 00:26:57.455]  Aaron got up and asked him questions about torture and war crimes and how can they say that they're above the law and that Bush was above the law.
[00:26:57.455 --> 00:27:01.057]  And there's video of that, of course, online at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:27:01.057 --> 00:27:02.598]  Hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:27:02.598 --> 00:27:05.599]  And they took him, they arrested him, he didn't resist.
[00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:12.723]  And they now are saying they could still press charges, but they haven't yet.
[00:27:12.723 --> 00:27:15.665]  But Aaron's lawyer has told him that it's still pending.
[00:27:15.665 --> 00:27:17.806]  So they've kind of got that sort of Damocles.
[00:27:17.806 --> 00:27:19.247]  And Aaron's like, I want to confront him.
[00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:28.754]  And I said, okay, let's get our food, because it looks like they haven't got theirs yet, and let's go ahead and eat since we're here, and then we can confront him.
[00:27:28.754 --> 00:27:32.315]  We start having discussions about what are we going to say to him.
[00:27:32.315 --> 00:27:34.917]  And I go, Aaron, you don't want to get arrested again.
[00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:36.177]  They'll claim you're stalking him.
[00:27:36.177 --> 00:27:38.758]  You've already been arrested for asking him a question.
[00:27:38.758 --> 00:27:41.379]  And I said, so maybe I should be the one that talks to him.
[00:27:41.379 --> 00:27:48.923]  And then I talked to the one fellow that was there with us that had a phone that had a camera on it, and I said, okay, get ready.
[00:27:50.544 --> 00:27:51.484]  We're going to do it.
[00:27:51.484 --> 00:27:53.345]  And then the gibbering continued.
[00:27:53.345 --> 00:27:55.646]  I mean, it was demonic.
[00:27:55.646 --> 00:28:00.689]  And so we were there about 25 minutes and it just continued.
[00:28:00.689 --> 00:28:02.089]  It continued on and on.
[00:28:02.089 --> 00:28:04.130]  And we're like, I can't handle this anymore.
[00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.751]  We've got to confront him now.
[00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:10.193]  Because I was wondering how a group of people could sound more like goblins.
[00:28:10.193 --> 00:28:17.496]  I mean, if you image Lord of the Rings and a group of goblins around a fire eating, you know, hobbits or something, it's what it sounded like.
[00:28:21.338 --> 00:28:29.163]  And then they'd whisper in each other's ears, because I guess it was all secret what they were talking about, and then the gibbering would continue, and it was pretty high-powered looking people he was with.
[00:28:29.163 --> 00:28:30.584]  I would guess they were in oil.
[00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:31.884]  I know what Texas oil looks like.
[00:28:31.884 --> 00:28:35.427]  They were all, hmm, a couple guys, big old giant old country boys.
[00:28:35.427 --> 00:28:38.709]  They were, ha ha ha.
[00:28:38.709 --> 00:28:43.512]  And then I went up and went to the bathroom, and I came back and saw they were looking at me, and I was just like, oh man.
[00:28:43.512 --> 00:28:46.974]  And then the gibbering and the giggling continued on and on and on.
[00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:48.660]  Unabated.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.226]  And I just said, you know what?
[00:28:51.226 --> 00:28:52.309]  Let's do something classy.
[00:28:52.947 --> 00:28:58.370]  Let's wait till they come back over here to the table, and let's just get up and say we're not gonna eat here with this war criminal.
[00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:08.295]  And so, once the staff came over, and we said we're leaving, knowing that the manager would then come over, then we got up and said, yeah, we're leaving because he's here, we're not gonna eat with him.
[00:29:08.295 --> 00:29:13.038]  And I said, not too loud, but enough for them to hear it.
[00:29:13.038 --> 00:29:17.480]  I just said, look, I'm not going to, and they had drinks in their hands and the food.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.723]  I said, we're not gonna basically eat in the same restaurant and sit right next to Hitler.
[00:29:22.623 --> 00:29:24.824]  And we left.
[00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:29.907]  And we basically shunned Karl Rove and made a little of a scene.
[00:29:29.907 --> 00:29:33.750]  But I probably should have said more to him or done something.
[00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:38.092]  It's just that it was almost like I didn't even want to address him.
[00:29:38.092 --> 00:29:40.954]  You know, I've addressed Janet Reno and George W. Bush and others.
[00:29:40.954 --> 00:29:45.136]  And he's so evil, he might have claimed that we tried to assault him or something as well.
[00:29:45.136 --> 00:29:46.357]  He's well known for that.
[00:29:46.357 --> 00:29:48.258]  So we just got out of there and went and ate somewhere else.
[00:29:50.595 --> 00:29:54.522]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.522 --> 00:29:57.186]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.186 --> 00:30:01.346]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:01.346 --> 00:30:08.289]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:08.289 --> 00:30:10.850]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:16.211]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:19.252]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:19.252 --> 00:30:21.313]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:21.573 --> 00:30:27.818]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:27.818 --> 00:30:31.200]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.985]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:36.985 --> 00:30:38.626]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:38.626 --> 00:30:39.927]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:39.927 --> 00:30:42.609]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:46.832]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:46.832 --> 00:30:49.414]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:03.783]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:03.783 --> 00:31:04.904]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:09.487]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:09.487 --> 00:31:15.431]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:17.192]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:17.332 --> 00:31:17.773]  I think so.
[00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:39.916]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:45.301]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:31:45.301 --> 00:31:48.505]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:31:51.508 --> 00:31:52.268]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.465 --> 00:32:04.028]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.028 --> 00:32:04.928]  Number 1.
[00:32:04.928 --> 00:32:08.350]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.210]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.113]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.113 --> 00:32:14.854]  It's true.
[00:32:14.854 --> 00:32:19.716]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.716 --> 00:32:20.557]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.557 --> 00:32:24.139]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.139 --> 00:32:27.841]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.041 --> 00:32:28.841]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:31.602]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.602 --> 00:32:35.284]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.284 --> 00:32:36.064]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.064 --> 00:32:40.206]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:45.268]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.268 --> 00:32:49.449]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.449 --> 00:32:51.230]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:56.713 --> 00:33:08.208]  877-327-0365 Devastating globalist lies.
[00:33:08.208 --> 00:33:11.772]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:24.456]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption, from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.456 --> 00:33:28.501]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:39.614 --> 00:33:49.481]  All right, finishing up with the Karl Rove situation and how it connects to Bush fears arrest, scrapped Swiss visit.
[00:33:49.481 --> 00:33:53.965]  And that ties into Cheney calls Mubarak a good friend, U.S.
[00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:54.845]  ally.
[00:33:54.845 --> 00:34:01.711]  CNN reports in a speech he gave Saturday, just to show how lawless these people are.
[00:34:01.711 --> 00:34:05.353]  And if they can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[00:34:05.353 --> 00:34:08.836]  Supporting murdering terrorist dictators like Hazar Mubarak.
[00:34:10.865 --> 00:34:15.805]  But continuing, I tried to get Phil in here.
[00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:20.335]  to tell the story of it, but he didn't want to go on air.
[00:34:20.335 --> 00:34:25.777]  Aaron was up here working late last night via his choice, so he's obviously still asleep.
[00:34:25.777 --> 00:34:32.659]  Tomorrow, or maybe when Ray McGovern's in here during the third hour, we'll get Aaron to pop in and tell his Karl Rove gibbering story.
[00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:35.860]  Because I said, Phil, did I give an accurate representation?
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.121]  He said, yeah, you did a good job.
[00:34:37.121 --> 00:34:43.823]  And I said, well, people aren't going to believe that this continual gibbering and demonic giggling was going on.
[00:34:43.823 --> 00:34:45.023]  Come in and back me up.
[00:34:45.023 --> 00:34:46.004]  But he said, no, it's true.
[00:34:46.624 --> 00:34:50.127]  Just I don't want to go on air, but because I can't believe it.
[00:34:50.127 --> 00:34:57.052]  I can't believe that we were there for about 25 minutes, and it was almost unabated nonstop.
[00:34:57.052 --> 00:35:07.000]  If you saw somebody at a bus stop, let's say you were taking the bus, you walk up to a bus stop, you're waiting 20 minutes, and they're giggling and gibbering to one of their friends like this, you'd walk on down the road to another bus stop.
[00:35:09.272 --> 00:35:11.153]  He basically drove us out of there.
[00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:14.555]  We were gonna wait and eat and then confront him with the demonic presence.
[00:35:14.555 --> 00:35:15.475]  I'm not kidding.
[00:35:15.475 --> 00:35:16.756]  Aaron's like, I gotta confront him now.
[00:35:16.756 --> 00:35:18.456]  I can't sit here and listen to this anymore.
[00:35:18.456 --> 00:35:25.840]  And we were just not talking, just sitting there listening to Karl Rove going, I mean, I can't even do it as evil as he was.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.542]  It was like, and the other ones were doing it.
[00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:31.663]  I'm like, what is this?
[00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:34.244]  Are these people ringwraiths or something?
[00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:37.686]  Are these people some type of demonic entities?
[00:35:37.686 --> 00:35:37.866]  I mean,
[00:35:41.266 --> 00:35:42.932]  It was amazing.
[00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:46.204]  And I have to say, I've never been around Karl Rove in person.
[00:35:46.204 --> 00:35:47.589]  I've confronted a lot of globalists.
[00:35:49.039 --> 00:36:00.209]  That point-blank range, and I talked about Janet Reno had an evil plum about her, but he definitely put off really bad vibes, and I didn't like being in the same building with him.
[00:36:00.209 --> 00:36:15.163]  And it was basically that we were all getting fired up, and we're really gonna confront him, and my gut was that wasn't a smart move, especially with Aaron already with charges against him for asking Lord Rove a question in public last year, so we got out of there.
[00:36:16.852 --> 00:36:28.117]  And now I will regret for the rest of my life that I didn't scream war criminal at him or go over and shake his hand, kind of like I did with Gergen, and then slickly ask him a question.
[00:36:28.117 --> 00:36:30.958]  But I think it was also because we didn't have any good cameras.
[00:36:30.958 --> 00:36:39.681]  We were shooting some video of him, trying to look at it, and it was just all, I mean, you know those steakhouses, you can hardly see in them.
[00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:44.323]  But I can make excuses.
[00:36:44.323 --> 00:36:45.764]  I think I should have confronted him.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:55.466]  I know Phil and Aaron, everybody thought that what we did was classy to get up and say, you know, I'm not going to eat here with basically somebody who's like Adolf Hitler.
[00:36:55.466 --> 00:36:57.367]  This is like eating dinner next to Hitler.
[00:36:57.367 --> 00:36:58.688]  We're leaving.
[00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:02.371]  That guy, well, I did say that guy's a war criminal.
[00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:05.873]  But.
[00:37:05.873 --> 00:37:07.695]  So I guess we did.
[00:37:07.695 --> 00:37:09.196]  I did do a little bit.
[00:37:09.196 --> 00:37:16.001]  But, you know, once I get going, folks, it would have been a potentially explosive situation.
[00:37:17.014 --> 00:37:25.842]  And I'm basically reflecting on it right now here on air.
[00:37:25.842 --> 00:37:29.265]  Now I should have gone over and then left.
[00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:30.346]  But then I'd have been thrown out.
[00:37:30.346 --> 00:37:31.667]  That would have been some kind of victory for him.
[00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:33.769]  I don't know.
[00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:35.410]  I can ask listeners what you think I should have done.
[00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:35.991]  But you know what?
[00:37:35.991 --> 00:37:36.591]  I'm not perfect.
[00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:38.273]  I don't have all the answers.
[00:37:38.273 --> 00:37:41.636]  But now perhaps I should just next time he's in Austin for a book signing.
[00:37:42.998 --> 00:37:44.539]  I know he lives here part of the time.
[00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:46.359]  He lives in Alabama, D.C.
[00:37:46.359 --> 00:37:47.400]  and Austin.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.121]  Reportedly he has a place in Tarrytown.
[00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:56.164]  But I'm gonna make it a mission now to at least go to a book signing.
[00:37:56.164 --> 00:37:59.105]  That way it's more of a quote public event and the guy isn't eating dinner.
[00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:03.267]  I also have an issue about people's privacy.
[00:38:03.267 --> 00:38:12.411]  One time we were at La Hueva Leone Mexican food restaurant off of, what is it, on 5th Street.
[00:38:14.246 --> 00:38:16.267]  And I was with the crew.
[00:38:16.267 --> 00:38:22.050]  That was about four years ago, one of the last times I was still doing the Local Access Show.
[00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:31.994]  And we went in and sat down, ordered our food, and there was a big table, again, right next to us, but with family and kids and a bunch of politicos.
[00:38:31.994 --> 00:38:33.515]  I knew I recognized some of them.
[00:38:33.515 --> 00:38:39.078]  And all of a sudden, Mike Hanson was there.
[00:38:40.034 --> 00:38:43.376]  And he's sitting here looking at the door to the larger dining room.
[00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:48.260]  We were in the back dining room and he said, there's Rick Perry, the governor.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.043]  And I looked up and 10 feet away, there's Rick Perry looking right at me at the door.
[00:38:52.043 --> 00:38:57.426]  And he goes, and gave me a look of concern and then turned and walked out.
[00:38:57.426 --> 00:38:59.248]  And I said, okay, guys, we're going to see what happens.
[00:39:01.644 --> 00:39:12.628]  A few minutes later, a couple of plainclothes guys in suits, obviously, probably state police security, probably Texas Ranger detail, you know, guys with bulges come in and go sit down at another table.
[00:39:12.628 --> 00:39:24.032]  You know, he went out and got, I guess, security out of the parking lot that was waiting, had them come in, and then he came in and went and sat down, started eating, and then he got back up.
[00:39:24.032 --> 00:39:30.414]  And he walked over and put his hands on the back of the chair of Raymond, one of Mike's friends that was there.
[00:39:32.691 --> 00:39:33.572]  Is it Raymond that was there?
[00:39:33.572 --> 00:39:43.597]  The point is, as Mike answered a few people, put his hands on the back of the seat and looked me right in the eyes and he said, I want you to have a great Thanksgiving.
[00:39:43.597 --> 00:39:45.558]  Because Thanksgiving was coming up in a few days.
[00:39:45.558 --> 00:39:48.320]  I want you to have a great Thanksgiving and I was just...
[00:39:49.718 --> 00:39:53.060]  Well, you know, Rick Perry's popped in on the show before many years ago as well.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:58.364]  But I don't know why I'm now digressing off into these stories, but I didn't confront him there either.
[00:39:58.364 --> 00:40:01.526]  I think it has something to do with their families being there.
[00:40:01.526 --> 00:40:03.388]  I almost did it with Rove.
[00:40:03.388 --> 00:40:09.172]  Right now, live on air, I'm trying to go back to my mind and why I didn't really fully confront him.
[00:40:09.172 --> 00:40:12.354]  And I think if they would have had children with him, I definitely wouldn't have done it.
[00:40:12.354 --> 00:40:14.095]  Because it's a private place.
[00:40:14.095 --> 00:40:15.937]  They think they're having dinner, even if he is a war criminal.
[00:40:17.011 --> 00:40:28.958]  But I almost did it, but they were with their wives and I just, I think the cherry on top, the straw that broke the camel's back was that Aaron, I said, Aaron, what's going on with that Karl Rove thing?
[00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:29.939]  Has that been decided?
[00:40:29.939 --> 00:40:32.320]  Is that over?
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:43.307]  And he said, no, they arrested me and basically put charges on him, arrested him for disorderly conduct and resisting, but then never went through with it.
[00:40:45.447 --> 00:40:50.052]  Aaron doesn't know the exact legalese, so I'm not sure, but I said, I said, that was almost a year ago.
[00:40:50.052 --> 00:40:54.716]  And then he said, I know they say it's another year until they could possibly charge me.
[00:40:54.716 --> 00:40:56.037]  Like I hate even talking about it now.
[00:40:56.037 --> 00:41:00.562]  It'll remind him to charge him the UT police through the city of Austin.
[00:41:00.562 --> 00:41:08.069]  But, uh, that was the main reason is that, uh, I didn't want to get Aaron in more trouble.
[00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:09.971]  Cause I know Aaron, he was going to start screaming at him.
[00:41:13.126 --> 00:41:26.810]  But I resent the fact, resent's not even the word, I lament, I regret that I didn't do more, but at least I did something.
[00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:31.931]  All right, now I've wasted a lot of time on this and I apologize for that as well.
[00:41:32.941 --> 00:41:39.604]  Okay, let's get into the Egypt news, and of course this does tie into the whole Karl Rove criminal situation.
[00:41:39.604 --> 00:41:50.889]  If they can sell us that Jack Bauer is torturing people and it's cool, and then the Pentagon admits that they're torturing people's children in front of them to get answers, it doesn't get any more Dungeon Keeper Jeffrey Dahmer than that.
[00:41:50.889 --> 00:41:59.193]  The Army's own Togumbo report, General Togumbo, put the report out on that.
[00:41:59.193 --> 00:41:59.533]  You can just
[00:42:01.038 --> 00:42:14.050]  Type in General Togumbo Report on Abu Ghraib Torture, one of, it's gotta be in the hundreds, most of them are secret, but it's well over a hundred that have been identified, torture sites all over the world.
[00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:23.478]  It's admitted that Camp X-Ray has a CIA run base within it in Guantanamo Bay, that's a laboratory for mind control and torture.
[00:42:23.478 --> 00:42:27.302]  And I can't even say on air, because children may be listening,
[00:42:29.539 --> 00:42:38.646]  What the government admits they do there to these people, but they're basically manufacturing folks that will plead guilty to create the illusion of terrorism.
[00:42:38.646 --> 00:42:45.151]  They're also recruiting people that they then put out as patsy operatives to go out and recruit other people to stage terror attacks.
[00:42:45.151 --> 00:42:46.673]  We know that's been happening.
[00:42:46.673 --> 00:42:51.356]  It's a very, very serious, very, very serious situation.
[00:42:51.356 --> 00:42:58.122]  But continuing here, Cheney calls Mubarak a good friend, US ally.
[00:43:00.015 --> 00:43:15.705]  And the government admits that the biggest concentration of black sites, ghost sites, torture dungeons, they've got them all over Eastern and Western Europe, they've got them in the U.S., they've got them in North Africa, is Egypt.
[00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:20.529]  And that Mubarak tortures people for even criticizing the government, including killing them.
[00:43:21.528 --> 00:43:23.330]  And so, of course, Dick Cheney has come out.
[00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:28.114]  Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is a good friend and a U.S.
[00:43:28.114 --> 00:43:33.838]  ally, but declined to predict whether the embattled leader would heed protesters' calls to step down.
[00:43:33.838 --> 00:43:35.200]  I think now he's going to go.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:35.980]  It's pretty clear.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.241]  The question is how long.
[00:43:37.241 --> 00:43:41.745]  He's trying to say September, but it could be a matter of weeks.
[00:43:41.745 --> 00:43:47.310]  Cheney made the comment Saturday night at a ceremony honoring former President Ronald Reagan in Santa Barbara, California.
[00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:53.834]  Protesters have pledged to stay on the streets of Egyptian cities until Hussein Mubarak relinquishes power.
[00:43:53.834 --> 00:44:01.580]  Mubarak, who has led the North African nation for three decades, has said that he will stay in power until September and will not run for re-election.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.883]  Cheney said the Egyptian leader should be treated with respect.
[00:44:05.883 --> 00:44:09.045]  He has been a good man, a good friend, and an ally of the United States.
[00:44:09.045 --> 00:44:10.566]  I mean, the globalist, Cheney said.
[00:44:10.566 --> 00:44:11.347]  We need to remember that.
[00:44:13.246 --> 00:44:16.128]  So there's that report right there.
[00:44:16.128 --> 00:44:23.014]  Continuing in a major escalation that we did predict a few weeks ago, Business Insider reports, senior U.S.
[00:44:23.014 --> 00:44:26.577]  Marines says multiple platoons are headed to Egypt.
[00:44:26.577 --> 00:44:27.938]  There is a system within the U.S.
[00:44:27.938 --> 00:44:36.825]  Marines that alerts the immediate families of high-ranking Marines that their Marine will soon be deployed to an emergency situation where they will not be able to talk to their spouses or families.
[00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:39.427]  The alert just went out, says one source.
[00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:49.858]  The senior Marine told our source that the Pentagon will deploy multiple platoons to Egypt over the next few days and that the official reason will be to assist in the evacuation of U.S.
[00:44:49.858 --> 00:44:52.240]  citizens.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.786]  One source was told that the chances that they were going over there were 70 yesterday to 100% today.
[00:44:57.786 --> 00:45:00.849]  We're keeping these people anonymous because
[00:45:02.401 --> 00:45:05.284]  Both would get in trouble for sharing this information with the press.
[00:45:05.284 --> 00:45:07.426]  On Friday, the Pentagon announced it would move U.S.
[00:45:07.426 --> 00:45:12.571]  warships and other military assets to make sure it is prepared in case of a U.S.
[00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:15.314]  evacuation, reported the LA Times.
[00:45:15.314 --> 00:45:21.360]  See, when I read a business insider who I found to be a good news source, people ask how I judge news.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.281]  A, I think this is a pretty good source in the past.
[00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:28.927]  B, when the LA Times is admitting warships are going there, who is deployed to get people out of embassies?
[00:45:28.927 --> 00:45:29.547]  It's the Marines.
[00:45:29.547 --> 00:45:31.729]  So, yes, this is accurate.
[00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:36.554]  And a major escalation on that front.
[00:45:36.554 --> 00:45:45.882]  American warships heading to Egypt, reports the LA Times and other major media outlets.
[00:45:45.882 --> 00:45:48.665]  Continuing, Egypt is locked in a standoff.
[00:45:51.937 --> 00:45:54.398]  It says anti-government protester.
[00:45:54.398 --> 00:45:54.999]  It's a photo.
[00:45:54.999 --> 00:46:01.942]  Leads chants against President Hosni Mubarak in front of soldiers guarding the Egyptian museum in the main square in Cairo, Egypt.
[00:46:01.942 --> 00:46:06.665]  Thousands of demonstrators continue to occupy the square demanding Mubarak's immediate resignation.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:08.460]  I think?
[00:46:24.102 --> 00:46:28.347]  Suez where they've had two weeks of rioting.
[00:46:28.347 --> 00:46:36.256]  Unknown saboteurs attacked an Egyptian pipeline supplying gas to Jordan forcing authorities to switch off gas supply from a twin pipeline to Israel.
[00:46:36.256 --> 00:46:43.204]  An official told AFP the attackers used explosives against the pipeline in the town of Laffin in northern
[00:46:45.234 --> 00:46:49.878]  Sinai near the Gaza Strip, the official said.
[00:46:49.878 --> 00:46:53.402]  It was initially thought the pipeline to Israel was attacked.
[00:46:53.402 --> 00:46:58.046]  The pipeline to Jordan has been attacked and the supply to Israel has been cut off, the official said.
[00:46:58.046 --> 00:47:02.410]  The army has taken precautionary measures to stop the fire from spreading, the official added.
[00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:10.898]  A rescue service for putting the fire out is not immediately clear who was responsible or whether the attack was linked to the deadly protest against President Hosni Mubarak's rule.
[00:47:11.198 --> 00:47:13.160]  Which entered the 12th day on Saturdays.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.401]  We're now to day 14.
[00:47:14.401 --> 00:47:18.564]  We still don't have details of what happened, and they still don't.
[00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:22.747]  So that is just some of what's happening.
[00:47:22.747 --> 00:47:31.814]  Continuing here, Egypt government hints it seeks to ride out protest wave.
[00:47:31.814 --> 00:47:32.535]  Leaders of Egypt's
[00:47:34.821 --> 00:47:49.549]  Unprecedented wave of anti-government protests have held talks with the Prime Minister over ways to ease President Hosni Mubarak out of office, but the government appeared this weekend to be digging its heels in, calculating that it can ride out the street demonstrations.
[00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:53.612]  But the rallies are intensifying, so that remains to be seen.
[00:47:53.612 --> 00:47:57.274]  Okay, next hour I will get into poll shift.
[00:47:58.137 --> 00:47:59.258]  How big of a threat is it?
[00:47:59.258 --> 00:47:59.938]  Is it real?
[00:47:59.938 --> 00:48:00.318]  Yes.
[00:48:00.318 --> 00:48:02.299]  The question is, is it about to happen?
[00:48:02.299 --> 00:48:06.701]  It is moving at a record pace right now.
[00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:08.782]  The North and South Poles.
[00:48:08.782 --> 00:48:10.303]  That is confirmed.
[00:48:10.303 --> 00:48:12.424]  But are we going to have a massive pole shift?
[00:48:12.424 --> 00:48:15.645]  If we do have one, it's going to be cataclysmic.
[00:48:15.645 --> 00:48:24.289]  You can better believe that you're going to see some fireworks if that happens.
[00:48:24.289 --> 00:48:26.290]  It appears from human history that
[00:48:27.554 --> 00:48:35.080]  There have been a lot of cataclysms in the past, but obviously there isn't good record keeping, especially after the library at Alexandria was burned.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:40.585]  But we're going to be covering that coming up in the next hour.
[00:48:40.585 --> 00:48:45.509]  I'm going to get into some of the other big economic developments that are taking place.
[00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:48.051]  But right now, let's take calls.
[00:48:48.051 --> 00:48:49.892]  I'd love to hear from you.
[00:48:49.892 --> 00:48:51.594]  Donovan in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:48:51.594 --> 00:48:53.195]  Welcome.
[00:48:53.195 --> 00:48:54.176]  Alex, how you doing, buddy?
[00:48:54.176 --> 00:48:54.396]  Good.
[00:48:56.045 --> 00:49:10.054]  There's a couple things I'd like to point out, and I'm glad you're talking about pole shift today, because I'm driving through Florida here, where they recently had to recalibrate the compass headings at Tampa International, and there might be more to follow.
[00:49:10.054 --> 00:49:21.982]  So, the pole's definitely shifting, you know, more in some areas than others, but I think the important thing is maybe it goes to show something solar-related.
[00:49:23.165 --> 00:49:34.435]  Uh, and that may tie into, you know, these weather anomalies we're having as well, and what, you know, uh... Well I'm sure if you just pay some carbon taxes and we shut down some power plants, uh, we'll all be safe.
[00:49:34.435 --> 00:49:37.498]  But, uh, being serious here, uh, here's Fox News.
[00:49:37.498 --> 00:49:40.400]  This is back from January 6th, so this is a month ago.
[00:49:41.701 --> 00:49:47.665]  Yeah, it does shift slowly over time, but it has accelerated quite a bit in the past, I don't know how many years, but it has started to accelerate.
[00:50:11.397 --> 00:50:11.797]  I don't
[00:50:33.482 --> 00:50:38.803]  Well yeah, if you look at the other planets in our solar system, they are also showing weird weather anomalies as we are, so...
[00:51:01.084 --> 00:51:04.427]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[00:51:04.427 --> 00:51:12.413]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[00:51:12.413 --> 00:51:15.515]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.
[00:51:15.515 --> 00:51:18.057]  You need a Black Hawk Down food plan.
[00:51:18.057 --> 00:51:21.180]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.502]  It's your countertop survival garden.

[00:51:44.576 --> 00:51:44.816]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:56.806 --> 00:52:01.350]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:08.336]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:10.898]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:10.898 --> 00:52:16.083]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:16.283 --> 00:52:19.224]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:19.224 --> 00:52:21.565]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:21.565 --> 00:52:27.847]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:31.248]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:37.050]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:38.710]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.011]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:42.691]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:44.112]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:44.392 --> 00:52:46.933]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:52:46.933 --> 00:52:51.496]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[00:53:56.447 --> 00:54:22.332]  All the major scientific institutions that measure it are confirming that since they've been getting accurate readings for more than half a century, there is the greatest movement in the polls they've ever seen.
[00:54:23.476 --> 00:54:26.997]  They normally just move around a very small amount.
[00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:39.863]  Now they're massively drifting in the last couple years, and that drift is accelerating and causing all sorts of problems, especially with the geosynchronous satellites that are engaged in GPS.
[00:54:41.983 --> 00:54:46.687]  But the problem is they've only been measuring it accurately for half a century or so.
[00:54:46.687 --> 00:54:50.010]  Some measurements going back, you know, more than 80 years.
[00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:57.957]  So we don't know this is part of a normal cycle, but NASA and others are saying it's the Sun that's the main driver of that, obviously.
[00:54:57.957 --> 00:55:01.900]  They must not have gotten the memo from the UN that the Sun has no effect on the Earth.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.502]  Let's talk to Donovan again.
[00:55:03.502 --> 00:55:04.763]  Donovan, you had another point you were gonna make?
[00:55:06.187 --> 00:55:18.342]  Oh yeah, I just wanted to point out that if the rest of the planets in the solar system are experiencing, you know, other weather anomalies similar, well not similar to us I guess you could say, but they are experiencing
[00:55:18.752 --> 00:55:21.893]  Weather anomalies that it would be implicating something.
[00:55:21.893 --> 00:55:26.374]  No, they are similar, especially the moons of the gas giants.
[00:55:26.374 --> 00:55:32.435]  For the last 20 years or so, their ice caps were melting, Mars ice caps were receding.
[00:55:32.435 --> 00:55:36.756]  Now they've been getting bigger again because the solar system's cooling off a bit.
[00:55:36.756 --> 00:55:43.598]  And because the sun is like a light bulb, it gets brighter sometimes and dimmer to simplify it.
[00:55:43.598 --> 00:55:46.579]  And that's why when I had David Rothschild on pushing carbon taxes,
[00:55:47.519 --> 00:55:50.440]  A, he denied they want carbon taxes, even though it's admitted.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:55.321]  And B, I said, well, why are the other ice caps melting if the warming's only on other planets?
[00:55:55.321 --> 00:55:57.282]  Because, you know, that's now four years ago.
[00:55:57.282 --> 00:56:02.503]  Since then, we know that the cooling has come back in and the warming's reversed.
[00:56:02.503 --> 00:56:06.564]  And he said, oh, that's because Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun than Earth.
[00:56:06.564 --> 00:56:10.125]  And I'm like, no, the order of the planets are Mercury,
[00:56:11.104 --> 00:56:17.948]  Well, I guess it goes back to their idea of carbon tax and, you know, saving the world of global warming.
[00:56:17.948 --> 00:56:20.069]  There's a couple things I'd like to point out.
[00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:21.790]  One being that, let's say for
[00:56:37.487 --> 00:56:47.050]  Uh, just for the sake of conversation, that their global warming is caused by CO2 emission and, uh, you know, they're gonna save us all, right?
[00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:52.092]  Well, their plan of action is merely put the Band-Aid over a gunshot wound, you know what I mean?
[00:56:52.092 --> 00:56:53.592]  It's not gonna do anything.
[00:56:53.592 --> 00:56:56.773]  We'd have to cease all fossil fuel consumption immediately.
[00:56:56.773 --> 00:56:58.974]  But, but, but, but, great point.
[00:56:58.974 --> 00:57:00.174]  I appreciate your call, Donovan.
[00:57:00.174 --> 00:57:02.815]  Look at the Kyoto Protocol.
[00:57:02.815 --> 00:57:04.876]  Look at the Kyoto Protocol.
[00:57:04.876 --> 00:57:05.316]  Look at it.
[00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:18.052]  It says that 167, if you want to be technical, third world countries, including China and India and many other greenhouse gas polluters, that's in quotes, they don't have to make any cuts.
[00:57:18.052 --> 00:57:25.534]  So if they restrict our energy here and make people pay more, well, what's left of our industry will leave even faster.
[00:57:25.534 --> 00:57:32.795]  And it doesn't cut back on emissions because our cleaner systems get turned off and then their dirtier systems increase upkeep.
[00:57:32.795 --> 00:57:35.376]  The studies show it actually increased the amount of carbon dioxide.
[00:57:35.996 --> 00:57:38.757]  I mean, it's all a giant fraud from one into another.
[00:57:38.757 --> 00:57:46.200]  It's a bunch of fear-mongering to sell global government and a global regime deciding who can have energy and who can't and how much you can use.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.281]  It's feudalism, period.
[00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:52.792]  By the way, we are getting rid tomorrow morning.
[00:57:52.792 --> 00:57:55.093]  We've never extended it this far into February.
[00:57:55.093 --> 00:57:56.453]  It always ends in January.
[00:57:56.453 --> 00:58:01.075]  We are ending the five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.tv tomorrow morning.
[00:58:01.075 --> 00:58:02.836]  I called Watson up and I said, you haven't got rid of the special.
[00:58:02.836 --> 00:58:03.857]  He says, I've been busy.
[00:58:03.857 --> 00:58:05.857]  I worked seven days, Alex.
[00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:11.520]  We wrote the article about the White House going after us.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.441]  I'll change the special tomorrow.
[00:58:14.639 --> 00:58:16.020]  Paul does such a great job.

[00:59:14.467 --> 00:59:20.973]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:59:48.772 --> 00:59:53.274]  Thank you.
[00:59:53.274 --> 00:59:55.655]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.655 --> 00:59:58.476]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:09.907]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.489]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.489 --> 01:00:13.030]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:17.234]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:21.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.705 --> 01:00:25.628]  We are now into hour number two coming up.
[01:00:25.628 --> 01:00:32.536]  We're going to get into forget Super Bowl pat-downs, Big Sis wants interrogations and behavioral tests.
[01:00:32.536 --> 01:00:39.644]  Now, at any public event, they're going to have locally trained goons asking you questions, prodding you, saying they don't like how you look.
[01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:43.149]  A total secret police tyranny that is coming up.
[01:00:43.149 --> 01:00:47.234]  Huffington Post agrees to a $315 million buyout from AOL.
[01:00:47.234 --> 01:00:51.058]  So now the George Soros affiliated group basically merging with AOL.
[01:00:51.058 --> 01:00:53.501]  Arianna Huffington to run AOL News now.
[01:00:55.063 --> 01:00:56.404]  So it's really a takeover in a way.
[01:00:56.404 --> 01:00:59.186]  It's not even them buying that, it's a merger.
[01:00:59.186 --> 01:01:00.287]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:04.070]  Obviously, the White House last Friday responded to our PrisonPlanet.com story.
[01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.291]  We're gonna be going over that.
[01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:09.174]  Ray McGovern getting into Bush fears arrest, scrapped Swiss visit.
[01:01:09.174 --> 01:01:16.639]  That's coming up next hour with the former top CIA analyst, advisor to George Herbert Walker Bush, his morning briefer, as well as Ronald Reagan.
[01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:19.842]  But we're taking calls right now until the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.404]  And then I'm gonna first get into magnetic pole shift,
[01:01:23.517 --> 01:01:26.318]  It's starting to happen, but how serious is it going to be?
[01:01:26.318 --> 01:01:29.019]  If there's a major pulse shift, it will be cataclysmic.
[01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.460]  We'll be discussing that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.481]  Marsha in New York, you're on the air.
[01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:35.342]  Yeah, hi.
[01:01:35.342 --> 01:01:35.782]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:35.782 --> 01:01:36.402]  How are you?
[01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:36.862]  I'm good.
[01:01:36.862 --> 01:01:38.163]  Welcome.
[01:01:38.163 --> 01:01:41.584]  Listen, congrats on the White House notice.
[01:01:41.584 --> 01:01:47.766]  And I'm calling about a situation here on Friday night in New York subway.
[01:01:47.766 --> 01:01:51.768]  A train stopped at a platform and we saw five cops.
[01:01:52.369 --> 01:01:52.910]  We're good to go.
[01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:18.929]  What I'm trying to say is for other people, if they see something like this, the least they can do is start taking, you know?
[01:02:18.929 --> 01:02:28.773]  You can buy little portable digital cameras that shoot decent quality for about 50 bucks now, and I need to walk the walk, and I normally do carry a camera in my car, and always carry one.
[01:02:28.773 --> 01:02:34.956]  You know, my iPhone is, but it's an old iPhone, because I don't like the new ones, but I'm going to have to go ahead and trade up and get a new one.
[01:02:34.956 --> 01:02:37.777]  I've had this one for over two years, since they first came out.
[01:02:38.637 --> 01:02:42.159]  Oh listen, did you see a special on MSNBC about Bill Clinton?
[01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.760]  You know the title is The World President.
[01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:58.402]  Yes, they're really positioning him to be a UN Secretary General.
[01:02:58.402 --> 01:03:06.769]  They've admitted that that's always been their plan, and Obama becoming the head of the Security Council, which no president's ever done, violates the Constitution.
[01:03:06.769 --> 01:03:08.991]  We cover that in Fall of the Republic.
[01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:15.676]  In fact, I'll give you the actual subsection code of the U.S.
[01:03:15.676 --> 01:03:16.497]  Constitution.
[01:03:16.497 --> 01:03:19.820]  I think it's Article 1, Section 9, but I know it's on the back.
[01:03:22.617 --> 01:03:24.338]  of the film so I can double check my facts.
[01:03:50.598 --> 01:03:51.899]  Well, it's crazy, of course.
[01:03:51.899 --> 01:03:53.979]  They're trying to make us ready for what's coming.
[01:03:53.979 --> 01:03:56.661]  That, you know, he's going to be our number one guy.
[01:04:11.068 --> 01:04:12.449]  And then after we've had a U.S.
[01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:17.913]  President, President of the World, then we can have a Communist Chinese President as President of the World, and of course global rules.
[01:04:17.913 --> 01:04:19.494]  Again, we're all being conditioned.
[01:04:19.494 --> 01:04:24.338]  Briefly, how did it end with the police beating the man?
[01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:25.960]  Do you know why they were beating him?
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:33.566]  We really hurt the guy because they ran his face into the metal part of the platform and they got on top of him.
[01:04:34.366 --> 01:04:37.527]  You know, but at least they stopped hitting him, and that was it.
[01:04:37.527 --> 01:04:42.329]  You know, the train stopped for like seven minutes, and then we just kept on going.
[01:04:42.329 --> 01:04:46.010]  But at least, you know, in the beginning people were laughing, and I'm like, are you crazy?
[01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:47.930]  This is not funny!
[01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:53.932]  And it takes one person to say something, to do something, and others will follow.
[01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:54.713]  Absolutely.
[01:04:54.713 --> 01:04:55.633]  Good job, Marcia.
[01:04:55.633 --> 01:04:56.753]  Thanks for the call.
[01:04:56.753 --> 01:04:58.974]  John, Chris, Peter, and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:03.586]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.

[01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:03.777]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:03.777 --> 01:06:05.078]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:05.078 --> 01:06:09.482]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:09.482 --> 01:06:15.428]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:15.428 --> 01:06:17.569]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:20.252]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:20.592 --> 01:06:27.096]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:27.096 --> 01:06:29.297]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:29.297 --> 01:06:34.640]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.923]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:39.923 --> 01:06:45.306]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:06:45.306 --> 01:06:46.647]  This will freeze the cost of your
[01:06:46.647 --> 01:06:47.068]  I think so.
[01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:03.336]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:07:03.336 --> 01:07:07.599]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:07:07.599 --> 01:07:12.522]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:07:12.522 --> 01:07:18.245]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:07:18.245 --> 01:07:25.289]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:31.812]  I'm looking for America.
[01:07:31.812 --> 01:07:34.914]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:07:34.914 --> 01:07:37.796]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:07:37.796 --> 01:07:42.319]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:46.541]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:07:53.999 --> 01:08:05.306]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:08:05.306 --> 01:08:06.627]  Big Brother.
[01:08:06.627 --> 01:08:08.388]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.149 --> 01:08:11.730]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:12.950]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:17.473]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:21.576]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:28.031]  We're now eight minutes into this second hour of worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:28.031 --> 01:08:28.871]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.192]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:08:30.192 --> 01:08:35.835]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.com.
[01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:46.621]  Ray McGovern, a retired CIA officer turned political activist, top morning refer to George Herbert Walker Bush and Ronald Reagan, will be joining us to talk about his take on what's happening in Egypt.
[01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:51.981]  Also, he wants to respond to this key report out of the Times of India.
[01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:55.087]  It's also in big European publications.
[01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:58.154]  Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit.
[01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:01.811]  He admittedly did order torture that is illegal.
[01:09:01.811 --> 01:09:05.955]  It doesn't matter if he says he's above the law or Karl Rove tells him so.
[01:09:05.955 --> 01:09:07.816]  This is illegal.
[01:09:07.816 --> 01:09:14.321]  And now he was to do a big keynote address there in Geneva but has cancelled it February 12th because he's worried about being arrested.
[01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:16.183]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[01:09:16.183 --> 01:09:16.923]  First time a U.S.
[01:09:16.923 --> 01:09:21.067]  president can't travel like Pinochet of Argentina or something.
[01:09:21.067 --> 01:09:23.289]  Very, very serious.
[01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:26.932]  Also coming up at the bottom of the hour, people keep wanting to hear my take on pole shift.
[01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:29.734]  And I've done a lot of research on it.
[01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:33.458]  It is moving at a record rate since they've been recording it in the last half century.
[01:09:33.458 --> 01:09:39.483]  And if it does shift massively by thousands of miles, you're looking at serious calamity.
[01:09:39.483 --> 01:09:42.246]  There's no doubt, serious cataclysm.
[01:09:42.246 --> 01:09:44.528]  I'm not saying that's coming or going to happen.
[01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:46.870]  But we know big asteroids and comets hit the planet.
[01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:48.832]  We know there are pole shifts.
[01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:52.055]  And it's just crazy that people predicted that there'd be a pole shift in 2012, and now it
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.562]  It's moving around at a record pace.
[01:09:56.562 --> 01:09:57.563]  Pretty creepy.
[01:09:57.563 --> 01:10:01.247]  I mean, do the globalists know something that the ancients knew that they're not telling us?
[01:10:01.247 --> 01:10:03.689]  There are all these martial law preparations.
[01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:06.952]  You've got all the world economic collapse coming along at the same time.
[01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:07.753]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:10:07.753 --> 01:10:11.196]  I mean, they admittedly have magnetic weapons, earthquake-causing weapons.
[01:10:11.196 --> 01:10:16.481]  Secretary of the Army William Cohen in 1997 admitted so in a press release, but it's classified.
[01:10:17.282 --> 01:10:19.403]  Tectonic weapons is what he calls them.
[01:10:19.403 --> 01:10:21.044]  Are the globalists doing this?
[01:10:21.044 --> 01:10:22.765]  We know they're manipulating a lot of the weather.
[01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:23.825]  It's just crazy.
[01:10:23.825 --> 01:10:26.467]  I'll talk about it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:10:26.467 --> 01:10:31.830]  Also, most talk show hosts I think would still be talking about this, but I covered it some yesterday.
[01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:32.910]  I'll briefly get into it today.
[01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:45.417]  It's a pretty big deal because it shows how vulnerable they are and how if real media actually covers the globalist activities, the light of sunshine, the light of exposure will
[01:10:46.357 --> 01:11:03.087]  Destroy their designs, but on Friday Fox Covered it Obama blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts, and they posted the present planet comm article very strange They're doing that more and more continuing, but I guess our articles well documented.
[01:11:03.087 --> 01:11:09.190]  So why they did The White House responded to it that evening the media matters
[01:11:10.951 --> 01:11:14.875]  Good morning Alex and thank you for everything you've been doing.
[01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:17.798]  Have you ever heard of Charles Walters from Austin, Texas?
[01:11:17.798 --> 01:11:19.459]  He was with the Austin USA publication on organic gardening.
[01:11:38.638 --> 01:11:40.959]  It rings a little bit of a bell, but no.
[01:11:40.959 --> 01:11:55.406]  I have a book here that he wrote before he passed away, and it's in regards to a physician up here in northern Michigan, a chiropractor, who took the elements chart, and this is for Dr. Wallach, to reinforce Dr. Wallach's information that you're putting out.
[01:11:55.406 --> 01:12:03.930]  And he, in the foreword of the book, and the title of the book is Minerals for the Genetic Code, and I can give you an information on how to get a hold of it.
[01:12:04.437 --> 01:12:05.898]  Minerals for the Genetic Cold.
[01:12:05.898 --> 01:12:14.125]  He talked about a county in Texas back in the early 50s, Death County, Texas, in a town called Hereford.
[01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:18.409]  And that's where they found high levels of fluorine in the water.
[01:12:18.409 --> 01:12:24.234]  And this is where they began their theory to put fluoride in the water.
[01:12:24.736 --> 01:12:32.224]  In this book, Dr. Ory takes the element chart and links it to the minerals and how they are essential and the positive and negative valences.
[01:12:32.224 --> 01:12:39.110]  So it's something I think really that is something people and you yourself might be interested in getting.
[01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:43.395]  Can I give out the website for it?
[01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:45.937]  It's emineral.info.
[01:12:45.937 --> 01:12:47.419]  The letter emineral.info.
[01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:55.593]  And it's a very, very, the very first time that this has been done with the element chart, Alex.
[01:12:55.593 --> 01:13:08.137]  Well, we know that the body needs all the minerals and all the trace elements and the vitamins to be healthy, but the system wants to make money off treating people who are mineral deficient that then causes diseases.
[01:13:08.137 --> 01:13:11.778]  They want to treat the disease itself and try to block it instead of going to the root of it.
[01:13:11.778 --> 01:13:12.699]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:12.699 --> 01:13:14.139]  I'll check into that.
[01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:15.940]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:16.640]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:13:19.338 --> 01:13:19.979]  Hello, Alex.
[01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.101]  Hey, buddy.
[01:13:21.101 --> 01:13:22.964]  Uh, yeah, I wanted to know something.
[01:13:22.964 --> 01:13:24.827]  I got a question here about the Health Department.
[01:13:24.827 --> 01:13:27.171]  I've got something about called the Risk Surveillance System.
[01:13:27.171 --> 01:13:27.852]  Do you know about that?
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.960]  This is federally funded, it says here in a letter.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.402]  Yeah, no, they have federal standardization, which is totally unconstitutional, of zoning laws.
[01:13:36.402 --> 01:13:43.103]  That's also in the climate treaty that the House passed a year and a half ago, but the Senate hasn't passed, but the EPA's still implementing.
[01:13:43.103 --> 01:13:57.606]  And it's federal zoning where they force their way in your house, where they talk about potential risk, and where basically they're going to try to take many of the homes and buildings in this country and artificially condemn them.
[01:13:57.606 --> 01:13:57.906]  Go ahead.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.740]  Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.901]  It's almost like a telltale squad because this is getting... Yeah, I know.
[01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:14.503]  It's telling plumbers, firemen, telephone repair people, cable people to basically spy on you realtors when they're in your home.
[01:14:14.503 --> 01:14:17.443]  Yeah, and this new guy that's been going on for 10 years.
[01:14:17.443 --> 01:14:18.403]  What happened 10 years ago?
[01:14:18.403 --> 01:14:19.564]  We had 9-11.
[01:14:19.564 --> 01:14:20.824]  What about Christine Whitman?
[01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:22.324]  I told everybody out there the air was safe.
[01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:24.225]  How many people are dying from all this?
[01:14:24.225 --> 01:14:25.965]  These people are a bunch of criminals out here.
[01:14:27.503 --> 01:14:32.773]  You know, there's probably some good people that are working on this, but if I get a hold of him, you know, I'm going to go into it with him and just talk with him.
[01:14:32.773 --> 01:14:33.455]  You want to talk with me?
[01:14:33.455 --> 01:14:34.998]  You know, I'm not going to answer any of these questions.
[01:14:34.998 --> 01:14:36.060]  I'm going to respect my amendment.
[01:14:37.397 --> 01:14:46.463]  Well, they're trying to basically give code enforcers and their minions unconstitutional powers to force their way into your home.
[01:14:46.463 --> 01:14:51.247]  And more and more in apartments, you know, they're saying, oh, we're going to do a drug sweep of the apartments.
[01:14:51.247 --> 01:14:53.809]  Everyone must leave at this time of day.
[01:14:53.809 --> 01:14:55.510]  And then the police all come into your apartment.
[01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:59.473]  They claim, well, you don't own the apartment, and so you don't get the Fourth Amendment.
[01:14:59.473 --> 01:15:04.457]  But federal and state courts have held that, yes, you do still have a Fourth Amendment, even though you're renting.
[01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:08.620]  So it's just absolutely incredible what they're doing.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:15.125]  I'm aware of those general developments, but why don't you email us what you've got to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:15:27.088 --> 01:15:27.669]  Absolutely.
[01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:46.808]  Now what they're doing is they're fully converting the society over to a tattletale society and saying it's good and we've all got a responsibility and the government's hovering over us with blimps and telescreens and drones and announcements and amber alerts that were for little kids and now are for, you know, is your neighbor, you know, owning firearms and
[01:15:49.514 --> 01:15:53.698]  They're trying to convert us over this total system of surveillance.
[01:15:53.698 --> 01:15:55.260]  I mean, take the Super Bowl.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.083]  She says it's your responsibility to tattle on everybody.
[01:15:58.083 --> 01:15:59.444]  It's your responsibility.
[01:15:59.444 --> 01:16:03.328]  As if people don't know if they see something that's really suspicious to say something.
[01:16:03.328 --> 01:16:04.890]  The message is look for things.
[01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:06.191]  Be spies.
[01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:07.593]  Don't trust each other.
[01:16:07.593 --> 01:16:08.754]  Terrorists are everywhere.
[01:16:08.754 --> 01:16:09.154]  And now...
[01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:22.559]  As they announced years ago, they're now rolling it out that TSA or TSA trained locals will pat you down, put their hands in your pants, search your bags when you go to even a school play.
[01:16:22.559 --> 01:16:28.220]  We're now seeing cases of this with a few hundred people at local junior high football games.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.641]  They'll call out the state guard in places like Alabama.
[01:16:31.121 --> 01:16:33.601]  And search little girls with Hello Kitty bags.
[01:16:33.601 --> 01:16:35.262]  I actually have a photo of that.
[01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:41.523]  And so our children are being trained, the public's being trained to live in this total surveillance society with no Fourth Amendment.
[01:16:41.523 --> 01:16:45.323]  Peter in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:16:45.323 --> 01:16:47.464]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:47.464 --> 01:16:49.144]  I would like, can you hear me?
[01:16:49.144 --> 01:16:50.384]  Yes.
[01:16:50.384 --> 01:17:00.406]  Yeah, I want to talk about, not the real crisis, but the fake crisis of global warming and not about its evidence
[01:17:01.155 --> 01:17:03.037]  But about the concept itself.
[01:17:03.037 --> 01:17:09.002]  Now you've pointed out many times that they want to interdict against CO2, which is very natural.
[01:17:09.002 --> 01:17:11.024]  Plants use it.
[01:17:11.024 --> 01:17:17.750]  But this contradicts the greenness because greenness is based upon plants.
[01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:20.720]  Which couldn't exist without CO2.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.884]  And we know the Earth has the lowest ever recorded from the soil samples and ice samples of carbon dioxide.
[01:17:26.884 --> 01:17:28.865]  We're in a carbon-starved environment.
[01:17:28.865 --> 01:17:30.967]  Thank God humans started putting it out.
[01:17:30.967 --> 01:17:39.032]  Unfortunately, we don't put out anything near volcanoes because the Earth is having less and less volcanic activity than, you know, what it had millions of years ago.
[01:17:39.032 --> 01:17:43.294]  So, obviously, we have a lower carbon level because the Earth is cooling.
[01:17:43.294 --> 01:17:43.555]  Right.
[01:17:43.555 --> 01:17:47.237]  What I want to concentrate is it contradicts their very
[01:17:48.619 --> 01:17:52.261]  Uh, supposed goal of greenness.
[01:17:52.261 --> 01:18:07.110]  Now, Lindsey Williams, as you know, pointed out that these, uh, elitists have to tell you, and I found that true not only with elitists but with others, that they have to tell you who they are and they have to give a warning.
[01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:15.135]  I think the very concept itself, because it is so fraudulent, it contains that kind of a warning.
[01:18:16.345 --> 01:18:19.970]  That means there are two kinds of people that fall for it.
[01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:26.219]  One group are those that just say, well, scientists are always right, you know, they're the new priesthood and all that.
[01:18:26.219 --> 01:18:28.342]  But there are other people that like it.
[01:18:28.342 --> 01:18:31.807]  They're bad, and they're on the other side.
[01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.329]  That's all, really, I have to say.
[01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:45.005]  Well, yeah, no, I've talked to a lot of mid-level media people and environmentalists, and they go, okay, global warming's a fraud, it's not caused by man, but isn't fossil fuels dirty?
[01:18:45.005 --> 01:18:49.406]  Shouldn't we use this as an excuse to push an environmentalist revolution?
[01:18:49.406 --> 01:18:57.309]  Nothing that's done from a point of deception is gonna bear good fruit, and what they're trying to do through their environmental revolution is not actually clean up the environment.
[01:18:57.309 --> 01:19:03.492]  They're allowing the cross-species genetic engineering, the toxic waste dumping, the dangerous weapon test,
[01:19:04.332 --> 01:19:13.975]  It's all just a brazen power grab, and they admit that's what it is, and you've got all these low-level people who get off on feeling like they've signed on to the power structure.
[01:19:13.975 --> 01:19:20.457]  Even though they know it's a fraud, they think that by agreeing with it, now it doesn't threaten them and they're part of the winning team.
[01:19:20.457 --> 01:19:23.578]  When they're not getting the spoils from this, even if they're a reprobate,
[01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:24.798]  I don't know.
[01:19:48.919 --> 01:19:54.537]  I'll give you some examples of one-dimensional thinking when we come back on the other side of this quick break.
[01:19:54.537 --> 01:19:54.918]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.979 --> 01:20:03.560]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.241]  No kidding!
[01:20:04.241 --> 01:20:08.643]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[01:20:08.643 --> 01:20:11.404]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[01:20:11.404 --> 01:20:14.866]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[01:20:14.866 --> 01:20:19.889]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[01:20:19.889 --> 01:20:26.792]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.

[01:20:30.814 --> 01:20:32.936]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.
[01:20:32.936 --> 01:20:34.277]  Fit standard mason jars.
[01:20:34.277 --> 01:20:37.660]  Are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.

[01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:44.465]  The original since 1976.
[01:21:00.512 --> 01:21:02.895]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:02.895 --> 01:21:05.217]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.217 --> 01:21:08.420]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:13.525]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.525 --> 01:21:17.730]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:20.394]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.394 --> 01:21:23.278]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:26.182]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:33.793]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.116 --> 01:21:39.501]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:42.363]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.363 --> 01:21:46.046]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.046 --> 01:21:47.127]  And I've got news for you.
[01:21:47.127 --> 01:21:48.468]  You're everyone else.

[01:24:14.084 --> 01:24:37.532]  One-dimensional thinking I want to do some whole Shows on this or special videos on this subject because it's so complex, but at the same time so simple and it's a fundamental issue of symbols and there's been a lot of Sociologists political scientists before them philosophers psychologists
[01:24:38.476 --> 01:24:47.765]  that have written about this and Madison Avenue and the propaganda masters they call it perception is reality.
[01:24:47.765 --> 01:24:49.807]  Perception isn't really reality.
[01:24:49.807 --> 01:24:56.855]  If you're on a bunch of LSD having a full bore hallucination and believe you're jumping off into a creek
[01:24:58.336 --> 01:25:01.857]  But you really jump off a 50-story building, perception is not reality.
[01:25:01.857 --> 01:25:10.420]  Or if you think you're a bird and you're gonna fly off a 20-story balcony, well, you're really gonna crash and die on the bottom.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.341]  Perception is not reality.
[01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:15.102]  Take a dollar bill.
[01:25:15.102 --> 01:25:16.463]  In fact, will somebody give me my wallet over there?
[01:25:16.463 --> 01:25:17.443]  I think it's got some money in it.
[01:25:17.443 --> 01:25:19.624]  I can't reach over and get it.
[01:25:19.624 --> 01:25:20.064]  Thank you.
[01:25:20.064 --> 01:25:25.906]  A dollar bill is a symbol of energy, but it's not redeemable
[01:25:30.338 --> 01:25:39.503]  A $5 bill is not redeemable in gold or silver, so it is simply an empty symbol of a commodity.
[01:25:39.503 --> 01:25:41.304]  Which again, what is commodity?
[01:25:41.304 --> 01:25:46.426]  It's some form of energy or something of value.
[01:25:46.426 --> 01:25:53.370]  But people one-dimensionally, I mean old-timers who were common sense and understood history, they knew how dangerous a fiat currency was.
[01:25:54.571 --> 01:26:06.922]  But as we became more and more symbol-oriented, it gets to the point where the symbols have no connection to reality anymore and create almost like a matrix-like system of deception.
[01:26:06.922 --> 01:26:09.464]  But here's an example of one-dimensional thinking.
[01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.986]  I saw a comment in our article
[01:26:13.593 --> 01:26:13.813]  I think?
[01:26:28.027 --> 01:26:29.869]  said I don't get it.
[01:26:29.869 --> 01:26:31.771]  I'm sick of Alex Jones.
[01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:44.565]  He has an advertiser that promotes a solar backup unit and Alex says get off the grid but then Alex is saying don't let them shut down our coal-powered plants.
[01:26:46.038 --> 01:26:47.579]  That's a one-dimensional thought.
[01:26:47.579 --> 01:27:05.212]  Anyone thinking in a two-dimensional, three-dimensional or some can think in a four-dimensional layer would realize instantly in a fractal design hundreds of different angles and points that show how unconscious and one-dimensional
[01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:08.318]  That statement was.
[01:27:08.318 --> 01:27:13.239]  In the ad, we say there's moves to shut down power plants, to increase prices.
[01:27:13.239 --> 01:27:15.400]  We should move to get off the grid.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.160]  But we need multiple systems of energy.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:23.501]  We need cheap industry for our factories and businesses and schools to be competitive.
[01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:31.943]  And China and Mexico and others, they get cheaper energy than we do, because the globalists have decided to invest in those countries, not here, and they're trying to shut off their competition.
[01:27:32.543 --> 01:27:39.367]  But see, that's not even a complex thought, but it's two to three dimensions deep.
[01:27:39.367 --> 01:27:47.432]  So, that person sees, I've noticed the weak-minded, they see contradictions where there aren't contradictions.
[01:27:47.432 --> 01:27:49.493]  And of course, the one-dimensional thinking goes further.
[01:27:49.493 --> 01:27:55.717]  A lot of people will just say lies about their boss, or their employee, or anybody, and believe them.
[01:27:55.717 --> 01:27:57.458]  Real liars believe their lies.
[01:27:58.493 --> 01:28:12.138]  And they believe that if they create the symbol in their mind, and that if they just say something is, that they've made the decision and now that's the way reality is, they've bought into perception is reality.
[01:28:12.138 --> 01:28:13.659]  They've bought into the packaging.
[01:28:15.405 --> 01:28:26.130]  And it's just extremely frustrating to see something like that, when obviously we're saying it'd be great if we could all have solar power, if we could all be off the grid and independent.
[01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:44.278]  The point is, our society and system is set up, and in the interim, we don't want to let the globalists come in with promises of Valhalla, when their real goal is to only allow their coal-powered plants to operate, so there's artificial scarcity, so they make much larger profits in the endgame.
[01:28:45.182 --> 01:28:49.985]  And they're already making those bigger profits by creating artificial scarcity and power.
[01:28:49.985 --> 01:28:57.569]  If there are plenty of power plants and anybody can set one up as long as they're clean, then that cuts into the globalist incredible profits.
[01:28:57.569 --> 01:29:06.193]  The globalists make huge profits and consolidate power through controlled markets that they're able to get through government power.
[01:29:06.193 --> 01:29:12.657]  And so it's that wedding of the megacorporations with government that is the great tyranny, that is the great tyrannous.
[01:29:12.657 --> 01:29:14.098]  And there's so many other examples of
[01:29:15.018 --> 01:29:15.960]  One-dimensional thinking.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.487]  You know, the TSA, Homeland Security, puts out a report.
[01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:23.013]  We want to stop child trafficking at the Super Bowl.
[01:29:23.013 --> 01:29:26.279]  And a one-dimensional thinker just takes it and says, must be true.
[01:29:26.279 --> 01:29:26.940]  Government said it.
[01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:36.836]  Meanwhile, if you have two three-dimensional thinking and historical understanding and have the data, you know the government's one of the biggest traffickers in women and children.
[01:29:36.836 --> 01:29:47.263]  And this is all just a PR stunt, but to protect themselves, they've got to have the movement against their own system so they can control any of the investigations.
[01:29:47.263 --> 01:29:48.764]  See, that's three-dimensional thinking.
[01:29:48.764 --> 01:29:50.925]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.925 --> 01:29:52.326]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.326 --> 01:29:54.848]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:05.001]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.001 --> 01:30:05.901]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:09.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.324 --> 01:30:10.184]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.184 --> 01:30:15.087]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.087 --> 01:30:15.828]  It's true.
[01:30:15.828 --> 01:30:20.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.691 --> 01:30:21.531]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.531 --> 01:30:25.114]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.114 --> 01:30:28.816]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.016 --> 01:30:29.816]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.816 --> 01:30:32.558]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.558 --> 01:30:36.259]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.259 --> 01:30:37.039]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.039 --> 01:30:41.181]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.181 --> 01:30:46.243]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.243 --> 01:30:50.425]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.425 --> 01:30:52.206]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.206 --> 01:30:56.808]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:01.092 --> 01:31:16.587]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:31:16.587 --> 01:31:20.270]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:31:21.263 --> 01:31:34.035]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:31:34.035 --> 01:31:41.302]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:31:41.983 --> 01:31:52.353]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:31:52.353 --> 01:31:56.297]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:31:56.297 --> 01:31:59.401]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:32:00.034 --> 01:32:04.216]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:32:04.216 --> 01:32:10.620]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:18.024]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:32:18.024 --> 01:32:22.567]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:32:31.552 --> 01:32:35.795]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:32:35.795 --> 01:32:42.559]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:32:42.559 --> 01:32:46.482]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:33:18.254 --> 01:33:21.857]  And I also want to finish up talking about one-dimensional
[01:33:22.927 --> 01:33:25.889]  I'm thinking here in just a moment.
[01:33:25.889 --> 01:33:37.215]  First though, we live in a toxic environment, there's no doubt about that, and our body uses nutrients and minerals to repair itself and to fight back against things like cancer.
[01:33:37.215 --> 01:33:46.040]  And there is a great sponsor we have, my wife uses it, I use it, Rob Jacobson uses it, innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.282]  Of course, it's won Best Superfood via Mike Adams and the Health Ranger.

[01:34:54.593 --> 01:35:03.940]  And as I said earlier in the last hour, it is your purchase of books, videos, t-shirts that gets the word out and supports our operation, the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.381]  Very easy to find.
[01:35:06.381 --> 01:35:08.122]  We've never had the special go into February.
[01:35:08.122 --> 01:35:11.545]  We've just been so busy, we take some programming to go remove it and take it off.
[01:35:12.505 --> 01:35:13.806]  It will end tomorrow morning.
[01:35:13.806 --> 01:35:17.267]  Today's the last day to get five plus months free at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:17.267 --> 01:35:29.192]  Go check out all the incredible special report videos we're posting, the archives of the live show in living color video, the higher quality audio podcast, seven years up and running at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:29.192 --> 01:35:34.355]  And that special will end in the morning when Paul Joseph Watson changes at about 6 a.m.
[01:35:34.355 --> 01:35:36.015]  Central Standard Time.
[01:35:36.015 --> 01:35:39.457]  So last day to take advantage of the PrisonPlanet.TV special.
[01:35:40.788 --> 01:35:47.752]  Okay, trying to get into higher levels of thought.
[01:35:51.227 --> 01:35:56.832]  One-dimensional thought is really not a natural state for humankind.
[01:35:56.832 --> 01:36:03.838]  We've been artificially put into this because of television, the internet, and society more and more.
[01:36:03.838 --> 01:36:07.601]  It's always played a role in deceptive governments and systems.
[01:36:07.601 --> 01:36:10.083]  But just to break down one-dimensional thought.
[01:36:10.083 --> 01:36:10.883]  One-dimensional thought
[01:36:12.605 --> 01:36:19.288]  at a subconscious level would be if you were watching us live via video right now and you think that you're here in the room with us.
[01:36:19.288 --> 01:36:38.879]  Or when you go to a movie theater and watch a film and suspend disbelief and actually just start accepting it all as true and your subconscious and your conscious basically become one for a period and you accept it all as real when you're watching that horror movie and you think the zombies are real and you're getting scared.
[01:36:38.879 --> 01:36:40.040]  That's one-dimensional thinking.
[01:36:40.791 --> 01:36:46.013]  And one-dimensional thinking, of course, is associated with lower brain function and basic instincts.
[01:36:46.013 --> 01:36:49.194]  But another example of it is obviously so-called money.
[01:36:49.194 --> 01:36:54.195]  When I call this money, I'm engaging in one-dimensional speech.
[01:36:54.195 --> 01:37:04.839]  I know this isn't really what we think of as real money that's backed up by a real commodity and that's redeemable in wheat or gold or salt or whatever's been valuable throughout history or land.
[01:37:06.308 --> 01:37:08.169]  Things that are associated with energy.
[01:37:08.169 --> 01:37:13.532]  This now becomes a certification or a symbol of exchange.
[01:37:13.532 --> 01:37:28.900]  But now they've removed any connection to any real tangible wealth from the money, and so they've brought us into this one-dimensional system where a lot of people will kill their own grandmother for a stick of bubblegum.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:32.302]  But another example of one-dimensional thought
[01:37:33.849 --> 01:37:45.959]  is people still believing politicians and just accepting whatever they say as if it's the received truth, kind of in a suspended disbelief mode of just receiving, not actually thinking.
[01:37:45.959 --> 01:37:55.928]  And to simplify it, complex thought, complex business, complex relationships, the most unsuccessful failures that we meet in life are people that
[01:37:57.045 --> 01:37:57.285]  All right.
[01:38:17.378 --> 01:38:19.399]  Relationships of doing one thing.
[01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:40.748]  Well, what is that going to cause and then what is that going to trigger and what are the possible outcomes of what of the ramifications of that development as it divides out into a fractal design similar to the butterfly effect or Throwing the pebble into the pond that causes the massive overall ripples tiny pebble if you have a
[01:38:43.226 --> 01:38:43.586]  Very good!
[01:39:05.427 --> 01:39:22.665]  Drivers like the wind or kids splashing around in the pond now the pebble isn't as noticeable And that's why the globalist politically want you watching TV responding to their stimuli Following their matrix false reality as they walk you deeper into unconsciousness and one-dimensional thinking
[01:39:23.789 --> 01:39:38.957]  Because when you act on your own, when you act in a multi-dimensional thought process and then put it into action and actually manifest it through actions, you begin to cause ripples in the universe, ripples on our planet, economically, spiritually, physically.
[01:39:40.091 --> 01:39:45.296]  You begin to actually have an effect and leave a mark on the world.
[01:39:45.296 --> 01:39:46.877]  They don't want you on the field.
[01:39:46.877 --> 01:39:54.123]  They want you as spectators, so their pebbles, or the boulders they're throwing into the pond, have the biggest effect.
[01:39:54.123 --> 01:40:05.112]  But the winds of change, millions and millions of people doing little things every day to further increase their understanding of knowledge, and to further put that spread of knowledge
[01:40:06.173 --> 01:40:12.278]  out to others and to promote moral ideas which are universal in mankind.
[01:40:12.278 --> 01:40:19.784]  The first thing the globalists do is tell you there are no morals, you can't have a view, there is no right and wrong so that you don't have a position.
[01:40:19.784 --> 01:40:26.970]  Then they come back with all of their morals about shut down free speech because it's hurtful and shut off energy because it's hurtful.
[01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:32.874]  They always moralize but then they're telling you, you should moralize because when you do
[01:40:33.915 --> 01:40:39.921]  Pick the position that's best for humanity, that's best for you, that makes you sleep good at night, that you know is wholesome.
[01:40:39.921 --> 01:40:52.392]  When you make those right decisions in life, it's winds of change they can't stop, and no amount of propaganda and lies can reverse the smallest amount of truth.
[01:40:52.392 --> 01:40:57.817]  And when you begin to put off the truth, when you begin to put it out into the universe, it has an effect.
[01:40:57.817 --> 01:40:58.678]  This is scientific.
[01:40:59.363 --> 01:41:02.925]  And I'm now getting into philosophy, and this is the type of stuff I think about 24 hours a day.
[01:41:02.925 --> 01:41:06.147]  I have dreams about this constantly, my understandings of it.
[01:41:06.147 --> 01:41:11.670]  But they're very afraid of you and the power that you have.
[01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:21.095]  And that's why the globalists admit in countless white papers that we've covered here that they wanted to make us promiscuous, that they wanted to make us animalistic.
[01:41:21.095 --> 01:41:24.276]  Because that stuff's addictive, but it's lower brain.
[01:41:24.276 --> 01:41:26.738]  And then it makes us more easy to control.
[01:41:26.738 --> 01:41:28.379]  They're threatened by a true
[01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:30.403]  Human.
[01:41:30.403 --> 01:41:46.837]  They're threatened by true dynamic understanding because most people, if they ever actually see the truth of the universe and the world, if they ever tap into that great truth, they then will immediately see all the corruption, the evil, the cancer in society, and you will not even have to have courage.
[01:41:46.837 --> 01:41:57.927]  You will hurl yourself towards the tyranny in an attempt to block it because at a fundamental level, you understand it's threatening to all that's good.
[01:41:57.927 --> 01:41:58.067]  So,
[01:42:00.253 --> 01:42:01.674]  They want you in the flesh.
[01:42:01.674 --> 01:42:05.798]  They want you in a lower state of awareness.
[01:42:05.798 --> 01:42:10.421]  They want you to be stunted because you're threatening to them.
[01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:29.397]  They understand the secrets of humanity, the secrets of our potential, and they have greedily decided to dumb everybody down, put a police state grid in, have controlled bioweapons releases, each one worse than the last, as they set up a tighter and tighter grid and basically wipe the majority of us out in the next 30 to 40 years, perhaps even sooner.
[01:42:30.037 --> 01:42:32.299]  But it's now being phased in.
[01:42:32.299 --> 01:42:35.881]  It's all documented, all admitted what they're doing.
[01:42:35.881 --> 01:42:42.645]  And it's something that is going to hurt 99.9% of us, and in the end, hurt the globalists themselves.
[01:42:42.645 --> 01:42:49.210]  There could be two globalists in a high-tech crystal palace
[01:42:50.586 --> 01:42:53.270]  A hundred years from now, two globalists left.
[01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:55.233]  They've got total life extension.
[01:42:55.233 --> 01:42:59.298]  They've merged with the cybernetic interfaces.
[01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:07.129]  They can, you know, do things that are, to the ancients, would be godlike.
[01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:27.435]  But they still at their core were wicked people that made the satanic decision to engage in nihilistic exploits of power grabbing, and they're still self-destructive at their core, and their projection on the outside world of wanting to enslave and degradate and dumb down
[01:43:29.127 --> 01:43:44.231]  That's gonna come back on them and those two final entities, those transhumanists, will rip each other to pieces and will destroy whatever creations they've made in an attempt to get the ultimate throne of power.
[01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:47.552]  This is a system that will extinct all life.
[01:43:47.552 --> 01:43:52.914]  This is a dark force that will give no quarter and must be resisted 110%.
[01:43:52.914 --> 01:43:57.435]  Alright, I'm getting into some pretty heavy stuff now, but
[01:44:00.268 --> 01:44:21.899]  Start little mental exercises of thinking about chain reactions in the economy, in business, in relationship, in lives, in everything you're doing and learn to study how they interact and at first you won't
[01:44:23.504 --> 01:44:32.006]  Have a lot of skill at this, but as you focus your mind on it, more and more you will develop what is known as discernment.
[01:44:32.006 --> 01:44:36.487]  And obviously some of us are gifted with more of it than others, but all of you have it.
[01:44:36.487 --> 01:44:43.288]  And I suggest you use it, because your life will be so fulfilled.
[01:44:43.288 --> 01:44:47.049]  I am so alive, I am so awake, that it's painful.
[01:44:49.542 --> 01:44:55.405]  My knowledge curve is growing so fast and it's so frustrating that I can't even articulate it.
[01:44:55.405 --> 01:44:58.787]  And the gifts that God has given us are so wondrous.
[01:44:58.787 --> 01:45:05.611]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God's got planned for the species.
[01:45:05.611 --> 01:45:07.652]  Think about how fast things have changed.
[01:45:07.652 --> 01:45:11.254]  Think about how
[01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:14.482]  We just got the internet really in the last 20 years.
[01:45:14.482 --> 01:45:17.267]  I mean it was around in the 60s but officially in the last 20.
[01:45:17.267 --> 01:45:21.112]  Think about how just a hundred years ago we got automobiles.
[01:45:21.112 --> 01:45:24.497]  Think about how people just take electricity for granted.
[01:45:24.497 --> 01:45:27.482]  Think about how people take it for granted that
[01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:34.831]  The sum of knowledge is got to be billions of times what it was just a hundred years ago.
[01:45:34.831 --> 01:45:38.413]  You can search instantly all the libraries in the world.
[01:45:38.413 --> 01:45:42.255]  You can search information on a trillion different subjects.
[01:45:42.255 --> 01:45:49.858]  You can get different views and different ideas from thousands of different perspectives on each issue just via the internet.
[01:45:49.858 --> 01:45:54.560]  The sum of humanity communicating with each other and advancing knowledge.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.920]  It's got a lot of bad things as well.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:57.121]  It's the spectrum of humanity.
[01:45:58.291 --> 01:46:10.542]  But just like children, you go to Africa, or you go to Latin America, and you go to the poorest areas, and you see starving children, their eyes are alight, burning with the human spirit.
[01:46:10.542 --> 01:46:16.988]  It looks like old black and white photos I've seen of my ancestors 150 years ago, 100 years ago, even 60 years ago.
[01:46:16.988 --> 01:46:22.333]  You look at every one of them, their eyes look wild with electricity.
[01:46:22.333 --> 01:46:23.815]  My eyes are dim compared to theirs.
[01:46:25.026 --> 01:46:32.994]  But you go and you see starving villagers, little children with their ribs sticking out of them, and their eyes are on fire, and they're cheerful, and they're happy.
[01:46:32.994 --> 01:46:37.639]  And if you give them a tin can to play with, they will cry, and they will thank you.
[01:46:37.639 --> 01:46:45.107]  And when you talk to those children, they have great intuitive knowledge, spiritual knowledge, because they're so close to death.
[01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:50.812]  Children who don't have enough food appreciate it.
[01:46:50.812 --> 01:47:04.239]  Children who don't have enough knowledge appreciate knowledge so much they're questing for it so they're already wide open like a flower to the sun and already have inherently all the knowledge of their soul and their ancestors in them.
[01:47:04.239 --> 01:47:06.280]  But then you look at my children.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:16.466]  Beautiful, electric eyes, eating healthy food, wondrous compared to many other children I know who are eating all the toxic garbage and watching television.
[01:47:17.864 --> 01:47:24.829]  But still decadent, always wanting certain types of food.
[01:47:24.829 --> 01:47:31.033]  A poor starving African or Asian child would gobble up spinach or Brussels sprouts and beg for more.
[01:47:31.033 --> 01:47:36.517]  But my children, even if I try to not make them decadent and weak, they're like I am.
[01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:40.131]  They're not as hearty because they've had it so good.
[01:47:40.131 --> 01:47:45.292]  See, we have all the knowledge of the world, but because we have so much knowledge, we don't even care.
[01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:48.313]  The general public, ah, who cares about the three branches of government?
[01:47:48.313 --> 01:47:49.893]  Who cares about quantum mechanics?
[01:47:49.893 --> 01:47:51.394]  Who cares about fish infusion?
[01:47:51.394 --> 01:47:54.695]  Who cares about heavy cyclotrons?
[01:47:54.695 --> 01:47:56.475]  Who cares about weather modification?
[01:47:56.475 --> 01:47:58.656]  Who cares about cross-species chimeras?
[01:47:58.656 --> 01:48:00.476]  Who cares?
[01:48:00.476 --> 01:48:04.498]  Because it's all there, so what?
[01:48:04.498 --> 01:48:05.758]  I'm gonna go to the bar and get drunk.
[01:48:08.012 --> 01:48:09.133]  Yeah, that's what they say.
[01:48:09.133 --> 01:48:11.474]  Or, I'm gonna go to the topless bar.
[01:48:11.474 --> 01:48:13.715]  Or, I'm gonna go watch a football game.
[01:48:13.715 --> 01:48:18.817]  And so, the world kills us with the largesse.
[01:48:18.817 --> 01:48:25.960]  The system kills us with just this fount of food and entertainment and distractions.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.861]  But notice everything the globalists push.
[01:48:27.861 --> 01:48:31.503]  Everything that they really drive on you is death to the species.
[01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:38.885]  And they're smart, and they've talked about it.
[01:48:38.885 --> 01:48:42.549]  Go back 80 years ago or so, they said, we've got to take over the education in this country.
[01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:44.030]  I have the U.S.
[01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:46.252]  National Banking Association from actually 1898.
[01:48:46.252 --> 01:48:51.717]  Read it on air where they said, we've got to take over the media, we've got to dumb people down.
[01:48:51.717 --> 01:48:52.778]  Have you read a newspaper?
[01:48:53.697 --> 01:48:56.778]  From 235 years ago when this country was getting founded?
[01:48:56.778 --> 01:49:00.239]  I mean, they weren't showing off with their use of language.
[01:49:00.239 --> 01:49:08.282]  They were really into it to use wide-spectrum, delicate words woven together to truly express their deeper thoughts and understandings.
[01:49:08.282 --> 01:49:16.524]  The average commoner was using words and complex ideas than top professors today.
[01:49:16.524 --> 01:49:20.245]  I can barely read a newspaper from 1780.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.324]  It's hard to read a newspaper from 130 years ago.
[01:49:31.324 --> 01:49:42.791]  The language is being destroyed, the use of words, their meanings is being changed, where people can't even basically communicate with each other anymore.
[01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:49.455]  And the globalists practice disinformation and practice dumbing down the culture.
[01:49:49.455 --> 01:49:52.537]  And those that understand this, they are advanced.
[01:49:53.422 --> 01:50:00.689]  Up to this advanced as you destroy your own species that you're bound to for eternity?
[01:50:00.689 --> 01:50:06.494]  This is what the heart of the matter is really all about.
[01:50:07.711 --> 01:50:09.953]  We are being inserted into an electronic matrix.
[01:50:09.953 --> 01:50:11.414]  We are not communicating with each other.
[01:50:11.414 --> 01:50:14.777]  Children at restaurants that I look at all have handheld video games.
[01:50:14.777 --> 01:50:16.378]  They're not talking to their parents.
[01:50:16.378 --> 01:50:18.159]  They're at the school all day.
[01:50:18.159 --> 01:50:19.820]  We are being programmed.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:35.673]  And once you aren't connected to the real world and street smarts and common sense, now as you're raised up with a tablet in your hand giving you what the government wants you to see, now they can give you symbols that aren't even connected to any reality.
[01:50:37.503 --> 01:50:40.825]  The globalists know what they're doing.
[01:50:40.825 --> 01:50:51.150]  And so, right now they're trying to sell us on total tyranny as if it's a good thing, because they believe the majority of people are disconnected from reality enough now that they can't even communicate.
[01:50:51.150 --> 01:50:52.951]  And can't be reached or helped.
[01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:57.553]  We're reaching a critical point, and humanity's starting to wake up and struggle.
[01:50:57.553 --> 01:50:59.794]  Because humanity knows how much danger it's in collectively.
[01:51:00.984 --> 01:51:02.284]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.284 --> 01:51:07.866]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.866 --> 01:51:12.888]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.888 --> 01:51:17.930]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:23.692]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.692 --> 01:51:30.794]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.794 --> 01:51:31.914]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.914 --> 01:51:38.276]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.596 --> 01:51:41.778]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.778 --> 01:51:44.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:44.800]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:45.100]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:48.583]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:48.583 --> 01:51:50.324]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.774 --> 01:52:04.857]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:52:04.857 --> 01:52:09.381]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:52:09.381 --> 01:52:15.526]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:52:15.526 --> 01:52:17.968]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:52:17.968 --> 01:52:23.933]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:52:24.053 --> 01:52:27.457]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:52:27.457 --> 01:52:29.339]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:52:29.339 --> 01:52:31.522]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:52:31.522 --> 01:52:36.407]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.727]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:52:53.727 --> 01:52:54.588]  How would that make you feel?
[01:53:03.217 --> 01:53:04.918]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:53:04.918 --> 01:53:07.459]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:53:07.459 --> 01:53:15.023]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:53:15.023 --> 01:53:16.524]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:53:16.524 --> 01:53:19.265]  Don reports dramatic improvements with hardened body extract.
[01:53:19.265 --> 01:53:24.588]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:53:24.588 --> 01:53:29.630]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:34.914]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:34.914 --> 01:53:39.338]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:39.338 --> 01:53:44.042]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:53:44.042 --> 01:53:47.424]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:53:47.424 --> 01:53:52.128]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:53:52.128 --> 01:53:56.312]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:54:05.339 --> 01:54:13.885]  You know, I can't do justice to the pole shift in just this one segment ahead of Ray McGovern joining us.
[01:54:13.885 --> 01:54:16.246]  So what I'll do is he leaves us at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:54:16.246 --> 01:54:21.830]  I will spend the last 30 minutes of the third hour exclusively on the pole shift information.
[01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:22.711]  It's just too important.
[01:54:22.711 --> 01:54:25.553]  And I'm not going to just spend five minutes on it.
[01:54:25.553 --> 01:54:29.796]  And again, it's exhausting to try to cover such a lofty subject.
[01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:43.508]  And then try to secrete the accurate paradigm information to you, because if I don't give the information out in the full spectrum breakdown, it could actually be used by the globalist for further deception.
[01:54:43.508 --> 01:54:49.394]  That's another problem with really becoming conscious and truly breaking things down.
[01:54:49.394 --> 01:54:53.137]  But I don't think there's a more important subject than the one-dimensional thinking.
[01:54:53.137 --> 01:54:54.919]  And once they get you in one-dimensional thinking,
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:03.523]  Then they can remove all trappings of reality and put people into a false reality.
[01:55:03.523 --> 01:55:08.204]  And many ancient cultures could artificially do this even with low-tech means.
[01:55:08.204 --> 01:55:13.647]  Generationally, the priest class would train the public to even give their children up to be sacrificed.
[01:55:13.647 --> 01:55:14.307]  Why?
[01:55:14.307 --> 01:55:19.609]  It's an act of total submission to go against the very human instinct.
[01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:21.170]  Every culture did it.
[01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:22.790]  It's a tropism.
[01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:23.871]  You know how a plant grows.
[01:55:24.707 --> 01:55:26.009]  The seeds designed.
[01:55:26.009 --> 01:55:27.771]  Well, tyranny grows a certain way.
[01:55:27.771 --> 01:55:29.573]  It builds a certain system.
[01:55:29.573 --> 01:55:30.895]  The Japanese, 500 years ago?
[01:55:33.077 --> 01:55:49.905]  800 years ago, a thousand years ago, had the exact same feudal caste system with knights and castles, fealty to a lord, to an emperor, to a shogun, exactly as they had it in the Aztec kingdom, exactly as they had it in European kingdoms.
[01:55:49.905 --> 01:55:55.227]  These are cultures that hadn't communicated with each other, but they build the same systems.
[01:55:55.227 --> 01:55:57.768]  Tyrants, just like a certain species of spider,
[01:56:01.584 --> 01:56:11.028]  The scientists that study arachnids, they can tell you, even if the spider's been eaten by a bird, what spider spun that web, because they know the fingerprint.
[01:56:11.028 --> 01:56:12.809]  They know the signature.
[01:56:12.809 --> 01:56:17.831]  And with the globalists, we've seen the web they've spun, but this is something new.
[01:56:17.831 --> 01:56:19.572]  This isn't the same web.
[01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:21.713]  They've taken all the old webs of tyranny,
[01:56:23.177 --> 01:56:28.261]  And laid them over each other and then put a new high-tech web over that web.
[01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:31.083]  And I'm looking at this thing and I'm going, whoa!
[01:56:31.083 --> 01:56:32.464]  This is a kill grid.
[01:56:32.464 --> 01:56:35.326]  And the Globalist and all their publications go, you better believe it is.
[01:56:35.326 --> 01:56:37.647]  We're gonna kill you.
[01:56:37.647 --> 01:56:47.134]  They openly talk about world government, one-child policy, forced sterilization, drugs in the food and water.
[01:56:47.134 --> 01:56:49.676]  I've got a report here out of Federal News Radio.
[01:56:49.676 --> 01:56:51.557]  Presidential emergency alerts to be tested.
[01:56:54.585 --> 01:56:58.026]  And they're upgrading it with presidential announcements.
[01:56:58.026 --> 01:57:02.067]  See, that just took me into a whole fractal understanding of previous data research.
[01:57:02.067 --> 01:57:13.130]  I remember in 96 talking to Kevin Stone, the engineer at the local FM I was on.
[01:57:13.130 --> 01:57:20.772]  I remember talking to other engineers when I was doing the show out of one of the other AMs here in town.
[01:57:22.236 --> 01:57:30.138]  And they had all been given, the feds always tell you what they're going to do a decade or so before they do it.
[01:57:30.138 --> 01:57:31.939]  They put it in place and they announce it.
[01:57:31.939 --> 01:57:38.120]  And how many times have I told you, through the federal EAS, you won't just get occasional tests anymore.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:48.943]  They told engineers and media companies 14 years ago, and then again 10 years ago, and I was able to read the document, shot video of it, it's in my film, Police Day 2000, 1999 release.
[01:57:51.806 --> 01:57:57.169]  They told him, when we're done, the government's going to take hours of broadcast time every day.
[01:57:57.169 --> 01:58:08.716]  That's going to be the new fairness doctrine, or one part of it, is that the government's just going to break in whenever they want, and they're wired in under law since 96 with their own receivers in all the broadcast units at the tower.
[01:58:09.943 --> 01:58:11.624]  The board op doesn't hit a button when they get an order.
[01:58:11.624 --> 01:58:15.487]  It automatically goes on, and the government makes announcements.
[01:58:15.487 --> 01:58:24.594]  They've also passed federal regulations where all clock radios have automatic transponder takeover arms, where it turns on by itself and makes announcements.
[01:58:24.594 --> 01:58:26.235]  Television sets have it in it.
[01:58:26.235 --> 01:58:27.997]  All the cable systems.
[01:58:27.997 --> 01:58:38.765]  And Federal News Radio is reporting, and they have a link to the White House announcement, that the President is preparing to start making announcements, getting you ready, of course, for when they give the true martial law announcement.

[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.841]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:51.841 --> 01:58:58.544]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.544 --> 01:59:01.326]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.326 --> 01:59:06.708]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.708 --> 01:59:09.750]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:11.811]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.071 --> 01:59:18.316]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.316 --> 01:59:21.698]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.698 --> 01:59:27.482]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.482 --> 01:59:29.123]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.123 --> 01:59:30.424]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.424 --> 01:59:33.086]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.086 --> 01:59:37.329]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.329 --> 01:59:39.931]  You can find the video at www dot

[01:59:56.063 --> 01:59:58.846]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.356 --> 02:00:10.199]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.199 --> 02:00:11.779]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.779 --> 02:00:13.701]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.701 --> 02:00:17.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.523 --> 02:00:21.585]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.693 --> 02:00:26.495]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Ray McGovern is our guest.
[02:00:26.495 --> 02:00:28.177]  We're going to talk about Egypt.
[02:00:28.177 --> 02:00:32.201]  We're going to talk about the big news out of the Times of India and other publications.
[02:00:32.201 --> 02:00:33.101]  Bush fears arrest.
[02:00:33.101 --> 02:00:35.083]  Scraps Swiss visit.
[02:00:35.083 --> 02:00:38.787]  It's funny, we were talking about this last night before I saw this news article this morning.
[02:00:40.213 --> 02:00:40.353]  I don't
[02:01:03.259 --> 02:01:06.680]  People like Ceausescu in Romania.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.961]  We're going to talk about all of that, or Pinochet of Chile.
[02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:13.022]  We're going to talk about all of that with Ray McGovern today.
[02:01:13.022 --> 02:01:14.923]  Ray, great to have you on with us.
[02:01:14.923 --> 02:01:15.924]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:01:15.924 --> 02:01:17.444]  I probably should introduce you.
[02:01:17.444 --> 02:01:29.729]  You're a former military man from the Vietnam era, and then of course you were the top presidential briefer to Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and you've been a big critic of the lies about WMDs and famously confronted
[02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:31.829]  Well Alex, there's an elephant in that living room.
[02:01:31.829 --> 02:01:33.410]  And the name of the elephant is Israel.
[02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:36.030]  And surprise, surprise, no one in this country is talking about it.
[02:01:56.423 --> 02:02:01.707]  This is an incredible blow, not only to the United States, but to Israel.
[02:02:01.707 --> 02:02:11.134]  They had depended on having a very safe frontier with Egypt since the accord where Egypt recognized Israel.
[02:02:11.134 --> 02:02:12.615]  And that's a long time ago.
[02:02:12.615 --> 02:02:14.056]  And they had taken it for granted.
[02:02:14.056 --> 02:02:20.921]  And all of a sudden, whoa, their strategic calculations are upset by this popular revolt in Egypt.
[02:02:20.921 --> 02:02:23.963]  So the real question is, what will the Israelis do?
[02:02:25.146 --> 02:02:25.847]  No.
[02:02:25.847 --> 02:02:28.769]  You know, people say, well, they can't do anything.
[02:02:28.769 --> 02:02:30.311]  They'll sit back and watch what happens.
[02:02:30.311 --> 02:02:30.491]  Right.
[02:02:30.491 --> 02:02:34.254]  That's the way they operate.
[02:02:34.254 --> 02:02:40.300]  Number one, they'll operate through their, well, how shall I say, their supporters here in the United States.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:55.933]  And this is one main reason why Hillary Clinton and our president have been waffling for the last week or ten days, not knowing whether to say, you know, Barck needs to get out, or, oh, maybe you can deal with this Vice President who's a well-known torturer.
[02:02:55.933 --> 02:03:01.098]  You know, it's really been painful watching the twos and fros and the unspoken.
[02:03:02.699 --> 02:03:21.661]  The factor that can never be spoken on mainline TV is what this means to the Israelis and how Israeli supporters in this country are putting the screws on Barack Obama again to make sure that he doesn't do anything that will make that part of the world still riskier for Israel.
[02:03:22.355 --> 02:03:23.115]  And now the L.A.
[02:03:23.115 --> 02:03:24.716]  Times reports a bunch of U.S.
[02:03:24.716 --> 02:03:27.898]  ships are steaming into the area.
[02:03:27.898 --> 02:03:34.821]  And on top of that, we're getting reports that Marines are being deployed into Egypt.
[02:03:34.821 --> 02:03:36.102]  They claim for evacuations.
[02:03:36.102 --> 02:03:36.642]  Do you buy that?
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:40.642]  No, I don't buy that.
[02:03:40.642 --> 02:03:46.189]  I think the Marines want to be prepared to follow orders as they always do.
[02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:49.213]  I don't think that the U.S.
[02:03:49.213 --> 02:03:51.095]  personages are in any danger.
[02:03:51.095 --> 02:03:53.739]  They may be back up at the airport.
[02:03:54.279 --> 02:03:59.222]  But none of the protesters have said they're going to do any harm to U.S.
[02:03:59.222 --> 02:04:01.764]  officials or tourists who remain there.
[02:04:01.764 --> 02:04:03.505]  So this is a pretty ominous thing.
[02:04:03.505 --> 02:04:08.808]  I hadn't gotten confirmation about these Marine moves, but that's what Marines do.
[02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:23.237]  And if Mubarak decides to make a last stand, he'll be supported not only by Marines from our country, but by all manner of support from Israel, which knows how to do this, by the way, and are only a stone's throw away.
[02:04:23.777 --> 02:04:36.406]  Well, we've had the British go into Suez in the past, and it is the Business Insider reporting on the marine situation, but if they admit they're sending ships, would marines go along with that?
[02:04:36.406 --> 02:04:37.527]  And that's who comes off the ships.
[02:04:38.254 --> 02:04:40.135]  Yeah, it depends on what kind of ships, of course.
[02:04:40.135 --> 02:04:47.700]  They can always justify the ships by a sensible danger to the Suez Canal.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:53.844]  We'll have to see how that plays out, because I don't think the administration here knows what it's doing.
[02:04:53.844 --> 02:04:54.524]  Ray, stay there.
[02:04:54.524 --> 02:04:58.067]  Let's finish up with Egypt, then get into Bush arrest fears.
[02:05:01.047 --> 02:05:04.630]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:05.931]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:10.335]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:05:10.335 --> 02:05:16.261]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:05:16.261 --> 02:05:18.422]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.422 --> 02:05:21.105]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.445 --> 02:05:27.951]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:27.951 --> 02:05:30.153]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:05:30.153 --> 02:05:35.498]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:05:35.498 --> 02:05:40.782]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:05:40.782 --> 02:05:45.967]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:05:46.147 --> 02:05:49.331]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[02:05:49.331 --> 02:05:52.316]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:05:52.316 --> 02:05:53.337]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:06:01.661 --> 02:06:05.685]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.685 --> 02:06:08.928]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:13.732]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:20.138]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.138 --> 02:06:22.361]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:22.901 --> 02:06:23.201]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.201 --> 02:06:23.722]  Bernanke?
[02:06:23.722 --> 02:06:24.382]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.382 --> 02:06:25.663]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:25.663 --> 02:06:27.904]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.792 --> 02:06:46.176]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:06:46.176 --> 02:06:49.079]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.079 --> 02:06:58.207]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:08:02.236 --> 02:08:08.858]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:08.858 --> 02:08:12.679]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.679 --> 02:08:18.460]  That's right, the United States has been captured by big offshore corporations that are totally ruthless.
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:28.202]  All over the world, these multinationals have funded dictatorships, corrupt bureaucracies to basically feed on top of their populations.
[02:08:28.202 --> 02:08:30.743]  And the people are rebelling in Egypt.
[02:08:31.383 --> 02:08:31.683]  I don't know.
[02:08:51.001 --> 02:08:58.405]  He was also in the military during the Vietnam War, and we always appreciate him joining us.
[02:08:58.405 --> 02:09:01.047]  He's made a lot of really accurate predictions.
[02:09:01.047 --> 02:09:12.332]  I remember about a year and a half before it happened, he said, well, I would look for Cheney and the neocons to try to stage a Gulf of Tonkin situation to get into war with Iran.
[02:09:12.332 --> 02:09:14.954]  Then about a year later, that happened.
[02:09:14.954 --> 02:09:18.476]  And then a year after that, we learned that it had been a staged event.
[02:09:19.336 --> 02:09:38.762]  So just amazing and so we need to listen up when he tells us what he thinks is really going on in Egypt and where he thinks the situation is going, what's happening with these pipelines going, these gas pipelines into Jordan and Israel being blown up, what the overall geopolitical ramifications are, and not just briefing presidents, he's now briefing us.
[02:09:38.762 --> 02:09:40.243]  Tell us again what's going on in Egypt.
[02:09:42.165 --> 02:09:45.788]  Well, Alex, it's very, very complicated.
[02:09:45.788 --> 02:10:01.118]  The main factor really is that the broad public support, the revolutionaries or the uprising people, are numerous, but they seem to lack a coherent leadership.
[02:10:01.118 --> 02:10:09.905]  The only bright light there is ElBaradei, the former chief UN inspector, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
[02:10:10.655 --> 02:10:14.757]  Who has wide respect abroad as well as in Egypt.
[02:10:14.757 --> 02:10:22.840]  A reluctant draftee, so to speak, but he has said that he would be willing to lead now and form an interim government.
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:24.081]  So that's the good news.
[02:10:24.081 --> 02:10:30.544]  The bad news, of course, is that for Israel and the United States, El Baradei is poison.
[02:10:30.544 --> 02:10:30.804]  Why?
[02:10:30.804 --> 02:10:35.946]  Because, oddly, this statesman insists on telling the truth.
[02:10:36.841 --> 02:10:43.045]  He was the one that has said all along that there is no real evidence that Iran is working on a nuclear weapon.
[02:10:43.045 --> 02:10:43.806]  And he should know!
[02:10:43.806 --> 02:10:47.328]  His inspectors are crawling all over that country.
[02:10:47.328 --> 02:11:02.598]  And he was the one, you may recall, back in March or April of 2003, who testified, I was watching it live, I'll never forget it, testified before the UN Security Council and said, you know those reports.
[02:11:03.599 --> 02:11:17.162]  Those reports that Iraq was seeking a Yolocake uranium from Niger, we have looked into it and in two days we found that they are not authentic.
[02:11:17.162 --> 02:11:18.023]  Not authentic.
[02:11:18.023 --> 02:11:19.463]  They were forgeries!
[02:11:19.463 --> 02:11:22.444]  Forgeries by, I think, Dick Cheney's folks.
[02:11:22.444 --> 02:11:24.104]  So, the guy is poisoned.
[02:11:24.104 --> 02:11:24.544]  The U.S.
[02:11:24.544 --> 02:11:28.965]  tried to get him removed from his post in the IAEA without success.
[02:11:28.965 --> 02:11:30.086]  So where did that leave us?
[02:11:30.086 --> 02:11:31.346]  Well, that leaves us with a
[02:11:32.186 --> 02:11:45.078]  With a very fearful Israel, stoking up fears in the United States about these Muslims, you know, these Muslim terrorists that could take over Cairo, which is a red herring.
[02:11:45.078 --> 02:11:47.040]  They're never going to do that in Egypt.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.162]  Egypt is a country of 80 million people.
[02:11:49.162 --> 02:11:51.765]  You know, the rest is small fry.
[02:11:51.765 --> 02:11:52.846]  Egypt is so big.
[02:11:53.386 --> 02:11:57.730]  The Israel, I think, will have to determine what it's going to do.
[02:11:57.730 --> 02:12:06.016]  And what it's going to do frightens me, because it has all kinds of possibilities, including... Well, let me put it this way, Alex.
[02:12:06.016 --> 02:12:15.543]  If I were ElBaradei, I would insist on a whole platoon of soldiers and bodyguards around me, rather than just the ten that exist now.
[02:12:16.892 --> 02:12:24.344]  Now, Ray, what's the stratagem of disinformation then, having the AP, the London Telegraph,
[02:12:25.410 --> 02:12:28.572]  Come out and say that the U.S.
[02:12:28.572 --> 02:12:31.313]  is behind Alberti and basically triggered this.
[02:12:31.313 --> 02:12:53.826]  Is that an attempt, knowing that if the West and Israel claim that Alberti somehow works for them, that that will discredit him at home in a country tired of foreign domination through the propped-up dictator, Hazem Mubarak, who Cheney is calling a great guy and a good man who we should respect?
[02:12:54.486 --> 02:13:02.112]  Yeah, Alex, if I were, you know, giving references for a job, I don't think I'd include Dick Cheney on my reference list.
[02:13:02.112 --> 02:13:04.013]  Yeah, that speaks volumes, doesn't it?
[02:13:04.013 --> 02:13:05.314]  Cheney thinks he's a great guy.
[02:13:07.731 --> 02:13:12.015]  Your initial point was having to do with the... I forget now.
[02:13:12.015 --> 02:13:15.159]  Well, no, I mean, the media is... Oh, the media, yeah.
[02:13:15.159 --> 02:13:18.322]  I've been claiming that Alberti is backed by the U.S.
[02:13:18.322 --> 02:13:24.930]  Yeah, well, you know, there's all kinds of disinformation campaigns out there to discredit somebody like Baradai.
[02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:39.066]  And you can be sure that we have our, quote, assets, end quote, in some of the more conservative newspapers and magazines in Britain and elsewhere, and so you can expect them to sow all kinds of confusion.
[02:13:39.066 --> 02:13:44.873]  The Egyptian people know what ElBaradei is and what he isn't, and that's what counts here.
[02:13:45.413 --> 02:14:01.945]  The only problem is getting organized to the point where they can actually face into the new Vice President named by Mubarak, who, by the way, is the CIA and Israeli checkpoint, their liaison guy.
[02:14:01.945 --> 02:14:06.408]  Not only that, but he was the fellow in Egypt that handled the
[02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:12.894]  Uh, the transfer of people that we wanted to get tortured.
[02:14:12.894 --> 02:14:15.537]  Uh, renditions is what we call it.
[02:14:15.537 --> 02:14:18.059]  The kind of nice sobriquet.
[02:14:18.059 --> 02:14:19.300]  Uh, yeah, renditions.
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:23.424]  And there was one particularly flagrant rendition.
[02:14:23.424 --> 02:14:26.347]  Uh, and this is worth recalling to mind.
[02:14:27.256 --> 02:14:31.377]  The fellow's name was Al-Dibi because he came from Libya, okay?
[02:14:31.377 --> 02:14:35.338]  And he had some sort of job with the training camps of Al-Qaeda.
[02:14:35.338 --> 02:14:37.738]  It seems that he was sort of like their travel agent.
[02:14:37.738 --> 02:14:41.359]  You know, he would arrange air tickets for people who wanted to come in and train.
[02:14:41.359 --> 02:14:47.460]  He wasn't anywhere near close to Osama Bin Laden or al-Nahiri or the others.
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:48.861]  But they caught him, okay?
[02:14:48.861 --> 02:14:50.001]  And then, before the war,
[02:14:50.521 --> 02:15:02.053]  The premium was on getting somebody to, quote, confess, end quote, that Saddam Hussein was training Al Qaeda operatives and unconventional weapons, okay?
[02:15:02.053 --> 02:15:04.456]  Yeah, and the fake airplanes, and it turned out none of that was true.
[02:15:04.741 --> 02:15:05.442]  Yeah, right.
[02:15:05.442 --> 02:15:11.286]  So, here you got Alibi, and he won't, quote, confess, end quote.
[02:15:11.286 --> 02:15:19.752]  And so they take him to, they send him off to Al-Suleiman, the current Egyptian Vice President.
[02:15:19.752 --> 02:15:23.515]  And they say, you know, you guys are better at this than we are.
[02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:26.557]  What we need to do is make sure we find out that
[02:15:27.819 --> 02:15:34.965]  Saddam Hussein was training Al-Qaeda operatives, and Alibi knew that because he was running the travel agency.
[02:15:34.965 --> 02:15:36.367]  And guess what, Alex?
[02:15:36.367 --> 02:15:37.788]  You'll never guess what.
[02:15:37.788 --> 02:15:41.671]  But the Egyptians succeeded in doing that.
[02:15:41.671 --> 02:15:44.354]  The cable went back to Washington.
[02:15:44.354 --> 02:15:52.801]  The next day, the President, the Vice President, and later Colin Powell before the UN, spun this tale as proof.
[02:15:53.872 --> 02:16:07.440]  And that is only one of the thousands of admitted crimes and lies and deception.
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:13.983]  Shifting gears, because we don't have a lot of time left with you, Ray, let's go back to who was involved at this time.
[02:16:13.983 --> 02:16:21.868]  Bush, Cheney, Karl Rove, the architect, Alberto Gonzalez, putting out memos that they could torture people, including crushing children's
[02:16:22.728 --> 02:16:23.748]  Genitals.
[02:16:23.748 --> 02:16:29.371]  And now Bush came out last year and in two different speeches and his book said, I'd order torture again.
[02:16:29.371 --> 02:16:32.772]  So this is admittedly illegal.
[02:16:32.772 --> 02:16:38.334]  There have been calls for at least Karl Rove or Alberto Gonzalez or John Yoo to be brought up on war crimes.
[02:16:38.334 --> 02:16:43.716]  But now we have the Times of India and other publications reporting Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit.
[02:16:43.716 --> 02:16:48.398]  He was set to give a keynote address and had agreed to do it is now canceled the February 12th.
[02:16:49.358 --> 02:16:50.198]  Uh, speech.
[02:16:50.198 --> 02:16:59.181]  Uh, before we get into this, recapping the international admitted crimes that were committed here, the lies of WMDs, the Downing Street memo, the White House memo.
[02:16:59.181 --> 02:17:05.762]  I was at a restaurant last night, and Karl Rove sat down right next to us here in Austin, and I just couldn't eat.
[02:17:05.762 --> 02:17:09.963]  We got up and said, I'm not eating in the same room with somebody like Hitler, and we left.
[02:17:09.963 --> 02:17:12.264]  It was a private place, so I didn't want to start screaming at him in there.
[02:17:12.264 --> 02:17:14.565]  Uh, but do you think I handled that right?
[02:17:14.565 --> 02:17:15.525]  What would you have said to him?
[02:17:16.284 --> 02:17:20.728]  Well, what I would have done, Alex, is call Code Pink right quick.
[02:17:20.728 --> 02:17:23.311]  They have handcuffs, and they have courage.
[02:17:23.311 --> 02:17:26.033]  The courage that continues to amaze me.
[02:17:26.033 --> 02:17:35.702]  They have tried to arrest him at his book signings, and what needs to happen is somebody needs to put the cuffs on him because he can be extradited and subjected to justice.
[02:17:35.702 --> 02:17:40.206]  Our government doesn't have the guts to do it, but the Spaniards, the French,
[02:17:40.706 --> 02:18:00.474]  The Germans, they all may, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which briefly means that if the government who is harboring these criminals is unwilling to proceed against them in a legal fashion, then under the Convention Against Torture, any government can initiate judicial proceedings.
[02:18:00.474 --> 02:18:05.016]  Now that's why George Bush, this is really amazing, we have word late Friday night,
[02:18:05.922 --> 02:18:12.191]  That George Bush had cancelled out of his appearance in Geneva scheduled for February 12th.
[02:18:12.191 --> 02:18:19.682]  And we learned from the Center for Constitutional Rights that they and their European counterparts had assembled 2,500 pages worth of indictment.
[02:18:22.726 --> 02:18:24.547]  Hold on, you're separately here on air.
[02:18:24.547 --> 02:18:27.148]  All we've got is a blurb in the Times of India.
[02:18:27.148 --> 02:18:31.270]  You're confirming that indeed this did go on and you have the bona fides.
[02:18:39.653 --> 02:18:40.433]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:40.433 --> 02:18:41.654]  Please continue.
[02:18:41.654 --> 02:18:44.615]  We've been in touch with the Center for Constitutional Rights.
[02:18:44.615 --> 02:18:46.055]  It almost worked!
[02:18:46.055 --> 02:18:53.998]  Someone leaked the fact that this thing had been given to the prosecutors in Geneva, and what Bush did was cancel right away.
[02:18:53.998 --> 02:19:04.662]  Now, the White House or the Bush spokespeople are saying, well, now he had heard that there would be demonstrations and he didn't want to, you know, he didn't want to burden the Swiss police.
[02:19:04.662 --> 02:19:05.622]  Well, Boulder Dash
[02:19:06.082 --> 02:19:11.327]  What he was afraid of was getting detained and actually brought to Hague for trial.
[02:19:11.327 --> 02:19:17.273]  Now, unless people think that this is far-fetched, this happened before.
[02:19:17.273 --> 02:19:29.184]  On October 26, 2007, again, the Center for Constitutional Rights, a really gutsy organization, filed a petition with the prosecutor in Paris.
[02:19:29.924 --> 02:19:33.105]  Donald Rumsfeld happened to be in Paris at the time.
[02:19:33.105 --> 02:19:35.246]  These things need to be taken seriously.
[02:19:35.246 --> 02:19:44.651]  Witness the fact that Don Rumsfeld went out the back door of the embassy, drove off to Orly Airport or De Gaulle Airport, and was on the first plane back to the United States.
[02:19:44.651 --> 02:19:46.491]  Cancel all his appearances.
[02:19:46.491 --> 02:19:52.254]  So, you know, the sad thing is that Obama doesn't have the guts to do the right thing.
[02:19:52.814 --> 02:19:53.574]  Well, Ray, stay there.
[02:19:53.574 --> 02:19:55.335]  Let's continue to look at this on the other side.
[02:19:55.335 --> 02:19:57.075]  Incredible information.
[02:19:57.075 --> 02:19:59.936]  Plus, it forces this issue of war crimes out in the open.
[02:19:59.936 --> 02:20:00.937]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:00.937 --> 02:20:05.478]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:20:05.478 --> 02:20:06.379]  Number one.
[02:20:06.379 --> 02:20:09.820]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:10.280]  Number two.
[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:15.563]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.563 --> 02:20:16.304]  It's true.
[02:20:16.304 --> 02:20:22.008]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:22.008 --> 02:20:25.590]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:30.313]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:30.313 --> 02:20:33.075]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.075 --> 02:20:36.397]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.518 --> 02:20:41.660]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:46.722]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:22:08.184 --> 02:22:13.287]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.287 --> 02:22:17.810]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:17.810 --> 02:22:20.151]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:23.032]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:23.032 --> 02:22:25.554]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:25.934 --> 02:22:33.555]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:33.874 --> 02:22:39.276]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.276 --> 02:22:41.597]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:41.597 --> 02:22:45.819]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:45.819 --> 02:22:46.879]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:46.879 --> 02:22:48.220]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:49.720]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:59.713 --> 02:23:03.517]  Most of us eat a blend of processed, man-made and all-natural food.
[02:23:03.517 --> 02:23:07.421]  But the food you eat may not provide all the nutrition your body needs.
[02:23:07.421 --> 02:23:11.585]  We now know that liquid vitamin supplements are absorbed faster than pills.
[02:23:11.585 --> 02:23:12.546]  That's why you need...

[02:24:06.570 --> 02:24:15.938]  Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst, will be with us another 15 minutes, and I promise I'll get to all these mainstream media reports dealing with pole shift.
[02:24:15.938 --> 02:24:17.740]  People keep wanting me to talk about it.
[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:19.141]  Paul Watson's written a big article.
[02:24:19.141 --> 02:24:21.923]  Pole shift threatens to cause weather chaos.
[02:24:21.923 --> 02:24:24.385]  That's what NASA people are saying.
[02:24:24.385 --> 02:24:28.048]  Fox News reporting they're having to recalibrate airport GPS.
[02:24:28.048 --> 02:24:29.309]  It's pretty strange.
[02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:30.831]  So I'm going to give you my take on it.
[02:24:31.651 --> 02:24:33.672]  uh... coming up after Ray leaves us.
[02:24:33.672 --> 02:24:42.618]  Ray, I think it's so important here for those that don't know the history or those that might have forgotten it to recap briefly all the different war crimes.
[02:24:42.618 --> 02:24:52.103]  I mean the knowingly lying about WMDs, the ordering of torture, the secret arrest, the rendition, the White House memos where the president is above the law.
[02:24:52.103 --> 02:24:55.946]  I mean Nixon tried that saying when it's the president breaking the law it's not illegal.
[02:24:55.946 --> 02:24:57.366]  That was proven to be a fraud.
[02:24:57.366 --> 02:24:57.767]  If they
[02:24:58.387 --> 02:24:58.707]  I don't know.
[02:25:25.899 --> 02:25:28.441]  Well, um, you know how much time we have?
[02:25:28.441 --> 02:25:31.283]  We've got about five minutes, and then we'll come back.
[02:25:31.283 --> 02:25:37.027]  Yeah, I adjust, of course, because you could go for 45 minutes just listing them.
[02:25:37.027 --> 02:25:45.734]  As Dennis Kucinich, to his great credit, did do, 35, 35 articles of impeachment.
[02:25:45.734 --> 02:25:46.515]  He read them.
[02:25:46.515 --> 02:25:49.957]  It took six or seven hours on the floor of the House, but he did that.
[02:25:49.957 --> 02:25:51.078]  They're on the record.
[02:25:51.078 --> 02:25:53.080]  You can get them from warisacrime.org.
[02:25:54.173 --> 02:25:57.674]  You know, the ones you mentioned are the more obvious ones.
[02:25:57.674 --> 02:26:06.437]  Also, starting a war of aggression, which was banned after World War II in numerous international documents.
[02:26:06.437 --> 02:26:12.279]  But, you know, one of the things that, toward the end, I think it's Article 33 and 34, that talks about his, at best,
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:25.528]  His complete incompetence in handling the intelligence information that was available before 9-11, that was criminal.
[02:26:25.528 --> 02:26:28.751]  That was malfeasance, not just misfeasance.
[02:26:28.751 --> 02:26:31.514]  And then, the lying about what he was told.
[02:26:32.294 --> 02:26:49.025]  Now, not many people know that George Tenet, the head of the CIA, lied under oath during the 9-11 Commission proceedings when one of the congressmen on the Commission asked him, uh, George, what did you say to the President during the month of August 2001?
[02:26:49.025 --> 02:26:52.628]  He said, oh, I had no contact with the President.
[02:26:52.628 --> 02:26:53.248]  I never saw him.
[02:26:53.248 --> 02:26:55.650]  He said, well, how about telephone?
[02:26:55.650 --> 02:26:56.830]  No, no, no.
[02:26:56.830 --> 02:26:59.732]  He was on, you know, he's been on Crawford and I was on, you know.
[02:27:01.213 --> 02:27:10.839]  That Tenet saw the President on the 17th of August, and on the 24th of August, and on the 31st of August.
[02:27:10.839 --> 02:27:12.360]  So he lied under oath.
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:16.643]  His statesman, or his spokesman, a little while later said, oh yeah, yeah, he heard.
[02:27:16.643 --> 02:27:18.144]  But that's what was on TV.
[02:27:18.144 --> 02:27:19.284]  Why did he err?
[02:27:19.284 --> 02:27:29.791]  Because Tenet, however incompetent he was, did tell him about that threat that Islamic terrorists were learning to fly airplanes.
[02:27:30.211 --> 02:27:31.012]  We're good to go.
[02:27:47.944 --> 02:27:48.445]  We're good to go.
[02:28:04.825 --> 02:28:06.666]  Yeah, they didn't do anything.
[02:28:06.666 --> 02:28:09.989]  Now, the charitable explanation is that they were just completely
[02:28:33.786 --> 02:28:34.587]  Incompetent.
[02:28:34.587 --> 02:28:46.137]  There's lots of reason to believe that there's a more sinister explanation, but none of them, to my investigative mind, are conclusive just yet.
[02:28:46.137 --> 02:28:57.227]  The other thing that needs to be mentioned, of course, is that there is a memorandum released by Attorney General Alberto González, which shows that George Bush, on the 7th of February... Wow!
[02:28:58.608 --> 02:29:00.610]  It's the anniversary, isn't it?
[02:29:00.610 --> 02:29:04.394]  7th of February, 2002, approved torture.
[02:29:04.394 --> 02:29:13.562]  What he said was, we don't have to obey the Geneva Conventions, we will treat prisoners, quote, what was the word he used, quote,
[02:29:16.721 --> 02:29:21.564]  And then we got the more detailed memos where they talked about what can we do.
[02:29:21.564 --> 02:29:24.006]  Well, we can bury people alive, yeah.
[02:29:24.006 --> 02:29:28.228]  We can torture children in front of their parents, yeah.
[02:29:28.228 --> 02:29:29.229]  Ray McGovern, stay there.
[02:29:29.229 --> 02:29:29.909]  I want to talk about
[02:29:41.493 --> 02:29:46.978]  But where this is going with an American president not able to travel to Europe, this is a big deal.
[02:29:46.978 --> 02:29:48.019]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:29:48.019 --> 02:29:51.122]  Then I'm getting into the other big news item.
[02:29:51.122 --> 02:29:55.045]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.045 --> 02:29:57.707]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.762 --> 02:30:05.305]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.305 --> 02:30:06.226]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.226 --> 02:30:09.648]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.648 --> 02:30:10.509]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.509 --> 02:30:15.412]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.412 --> 02:30:16.152]  It's true.
[02:30:16.152 --> 02:30:21.016]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.016 --> 02:30:21.856]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.856 --> 02:30:25.438]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.438 --> 02:30:29.141]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.321 --> 02:30:30.142]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.142 --> 02:30:32.884]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.884 --> 02:30:36.567]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.567 --> 02:30:37.368]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.368 --> 02:30:41.512]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.512 --> 02:30:46.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.556 --> 02:30:50.738]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.738 --> 02:30:52.519]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:00.578 --> 02:31:04.421]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:31:04.421 --> 02:31:08.705]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:31:08.705 --> 02:31:13.388]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:31:13.388 --> 02:31:19.333]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:31:19.333 --> 02:31:22.616]  Not worried about them moving south.
[02:31:22.616 --> 02:31:26.539]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:31:29.122 --> 02:31:34.646]  I'm looking for America.
[02:31:34.646 --> 02:31:36.627]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:31:36.627 --> 02:31:38.889]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:43.512]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[02:31:43.512 --> 02:31:47.254]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:31:55.071 --> 02:32:00.714]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:32:00.714 --> 02:32:04.296]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:32:04.296 --> 02:32:05.596]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:32:05.596 --> 02:32:09.999]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:32:09.999 --> 02:32:15.941]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:32:15.941 --> 02:32:18.083]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:32:18.083 --> 02:32:20.764]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:32:21.104 --> 02:32:27.609]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:32:27.609 --> 02:32:29.810]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:32:29.810 --> 02:32:35.154]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:32:35.154 --> 02:32:40.438]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:32:40.438 --> 02:32:45.602]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:32:45.802 --> 02:32:49.005]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[02:32:49.005 --> 02:32:52.007]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:52.007 --> 02:32:52.768]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:33:09.744 --> 02:33:13.968]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:33:13.968 --> 02:33:18.172]  No, I won't back down.
[02:33:18.172 --> 02:33:24.598]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[02:33:24.598 --> 02:33:32.145]  Former top CIA analyst, Ray McGovern, a true specialist in geopolitical machinations, is our guest for another six minutes or so.
[02:33:32.145 --> 02:33:33.366]  Have you just joined us?
[02:33:33.366 --> 02:33:34.267]  Bush fears arrest.
[02:33:34.787 --> 02:33:40.490]  Well, this is the first time that, let's say, people who are interested found out in advance of Bush's travel plans to Europe.
[02:34:05.530 --> 02:34:17.007]  Uh, and so the, uh, Center for Constitutional Rights, which does not shy away from, uh, from controversy, and its European counterparts put together a 2,500
[02:34:19.341 --> 02:34:20.242]  We're good to go.
[02:34:41.918 --> 02:34:46.320]  And, uh, what George Bush said, well, uh, yeah, I authorized torture and I'd do it again.
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:49.962]  And the fellow said, well, uh, do you think it was legal?
[02:34:49.962 --> 02:34:55.585]  And what Bush said is, the lawyers said it was legal, and I have to follow my specialists.
[02:34:55.585 --> 02:34:57.706]  So, here we have the lawyers, right?
[02:34:57.706 --> 02:35:02.628]  Now, mafia lawyers will always tell you what's legal or not.
[02:35:02.628 --> 02:35:10.332]  These lawyers, and there are six of them, that are being, um, possibly prosecuted in a Spanish court.
[02:35:11.161 --> 02:35:26.673]  And 1 March is the drop-dead date, because under the International Convention Against Torture, if a host country harbors a torturer and does not proceed against him judicially, then any country can do so.
[02:35:26.673 --> 02:35:28.794]  Any country that has signed that convention.
[02:35:28.794 --> 02:35:32.497]  And Spain, Germany, Italy, the rest of them have all signed it.
[02:35:32.497 --> 02:35:34.919]  So, where's the... and the Swiss.
[02:35:35.399 --> 02:35:36.580]  So what does this mean?
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:44.685]  Well, Bush had to cancel his trip, which is highly embarrassing that a former president of the United States can't travel to Europe, but there it is.
[02:35:44.685 --> 02:35:46.746]  Now, what about the lawyers?
[02:35:46.746 --> 02:35:48.187]  The lawyers are not exempt.
[02:35:48.187 --> 02:35:50.048]  You know, they claim, well, we just gave advice.
[02:35:50.048 --> 02:35:51.509]  Bush was the decider.
[02:35:51.509 --> 02:35:59.194]  The lawyers under the Nazi regime in Germany were prosecuted, convicted, and given strong jail terms.
[02:35:59.494 --> 02:36:01.835]  Yeah, that's the just-following-orders situation.
[02:36:01.835 --> 02:36:04.957]  Yeah, so these lawyers are equally culpable.
[02:36:04.957 --> 02:36:18.624]  Their names are Gonzales, Addington, J. Bybee, Jim Haynes, Fyfe, and one other whose name escapes me.
[02:36:18.624 --> 02:36:19.605]  John Yoo?
[02:36:19.605 --> 02:36:20.866]  Yeah, John Yoo, you got it.
[02:36:20.866 --> 02:36:22.446]  Okay, so those are the six.
[02:36:22.446 --> 02:36:28.049]  Now, by March 1st, the Spanish court has demanded that the U.S.
[02:36:28.049 --> 02:36:28.830]  Attorney General
[02:36:29.685 --> 02:36:35.027]  Tell Spain, are we prosecuting them here or are we not?
[02:36:35.027 --> 02:36:42.129]  The answer, of course, will be we're not prosecuting them here because Obama says he likes to look forward rather than to look back, okay?
[02:36:42.129 --> 02:36:44.470]  So, what will that cause?
[02:36:44.470 --> 02:36:49.192]  We hope, and we dearly hope... That makes them complicit and then their courts get involved.
[02:36:49.192 --> 02:36:58.295]  Well, yeah, and so the Spanish court, just as they did, by the way, with the other torturer, the guy from Chile, Pinochet,
[02:36:59.255 --> 02:37:12.062]  Just as they did with him, they have the option to proceed against George W. Bush for his war crimes, according to the affidavit and the complaint that was given to the Geneva authorities.
[02:37:12.062 --> 02:37:17.425]  And so that's why he quit, and the ones in the things that are going forward in Spain
[02:37:18.539 --> 02:37:26.504]  Are the lawyers that are said to have given this advice, well we know they gave this advice to George Bush because that's what he wanted, so the lawyers are not exempt.
[02:37:26.504 --> 02:37:47.858]  There are all kinds of international ramifications here and it's a good thing that finally somebody is taking international law seriously because Barack Obama and Eric Holder, to my great disappointment, don't really care much about international law when it comes to prosecuting former officials.
[02:37:47.918 --> 02:38:07.266]  Well, in the final equation, regardless of what happens, justice be done by the heavens full, we have to do the right thing, and when crimes are committed by the highest office holder and his minions, we at least need to point it out so that it's on record, so that they don't create some type of precedent by our inaction.
[02:38:07.266 --> 02:38:11.928]  I mean, we are forced to morally stand up and point out what's happening here, so at least the history books
[02:38:13.024 --> 02:38:15.007]  Yeah, Alex, you mentioned two words that are really operative.
[02:38:15.007 --> 02:38:15.267]  One is moral.
[02:38:31.679 --> 02:38:41.683]  Nobody talks about moral anymore, but that's what's at stake here, the soul of our nation, and the fact that precedent will be set if we let a president get away with this.
[02:38:41.683 --> 02:38:55.589]  And so, you know, we're trying from our end, but the Swiss and the Spanish know that we're trying, and it's up to them in a sense, and they are, you know, they're under great pressure
[02:38:55.589 --> 02:38:56.009]  We're good.
[02:39:15.991 --> 02:39:16.231]  I think so.
[02:39:33.226 --> 02:39:33.927]  I don't know.
[02:39:50.083 --> 02:39:55.388]  And he was gibbering and cackling like a witch almost incessantly.
[02:39:55.388 --> 02:39:59.272]  And he, I mean, if I saw somebody at a bus stop like this, I think they were crazy.
[02:39:59.272 --> 02:40:04.616]  I mean, he came off like a textbook villain.
[02:40:04.616 --> 02:40:10.322]  I mean, it was, I mean, I have witnesses, I have crew members that were there, just all demonic laughter.
[02:40:10.322 --> 02:40:12.364]  Have you ever heard that about Karl Rove or Turd Blossom?
[02:40:14.014 --> 02:40:20.876]  I haven't heard about the demonic laughter, but I have seen the demonic activities that he's been guilty of.
[02:40:20.876 --> 02:40:23.896]  You know, I face this situation with Rumsfeld.
[02:40:23.896 --> 02:40:30.418]  Rumsfeld is coming to town next week to sell his book, and I will go and confront him if I can.
[02:40:30.418 --> 02:40:32.638]  Certainly my colleagues will do the same.
[02:40:32.638 --> 02:40:41.660]  It's always a judgment call, and you're a public figure, and you have other considerations, but where are you in those situations?
[02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:58.807]  I would have stood up and very politely said, uh, Karl Rove, um, we find you guilty of this, that, and the other thing, and I can't sit next to you, so it's either you and me, uh, you or me get out of here and I'm staying and see what happens, and it would cause a row, uh, but, you know, that's what it is.
[02:40:58.807 --> 02:40:59.728]  You're in Houston, are you?
[02:41:00.763 --> 02:41:02.884]  No, I'm in Austin, Texas.
[02:41:02.884 --> 02:41:08.227]  To be clear, we got up and said, we're not going to sit basically in a restaurant with Hitler.
[02:41:08.227 --> 02:41:11.248]  That guy's a war criminal and left.
[02:41:11.248 --> 02:41:15.470]  And I have confronted politicians and been arrested for just asking George Bush a question.
[02:41:15.470 --> 02:41:18.171]  So I've confronted Janet Reno and countless others.
[02:41:18.171 --> 02:41:25.555]  It's just that, well, plus Aaron Dykes, who was with me, was arrested about a year ago in Austin for asking him a question at the University of Texas.
[02:41:25.555 --> 02:41:26.895]  And that case is still pending.
[02:41:28.636 --> 02:41:31.120]  I mean, that's probably why we didn't just really start screaming at him.
[02:41:33.857 --> 02:41:37.038]  You're right, this guy's a war criminal, and we probably should have gone further.
[02:41:37.038 --> 02:41:38.619]  Well, it's a judgment call.
[02:41:38.619 --> 02:41:58.928]  You may get another chance, but for your listeners, if they see Karl Rove around, I hope that knowing what he's done, that you don't sit around like those obedient Germans in the 30s, and you confront them directly and say, you know, we think you ought to be arrested, and if you wait here for a second, we'll get those ladies from Code Pink to have the handcuffs to put them on you.
[02:41:59.769 --> 02:42:04.644]  Something like that, because he should not be able to walk around freely, given what he's guilty of.
[02:42:05.985 --> 02:42:06.805]  I agree with you.
[02:42:06.805 --> 02:42:09.066]  Ray McGovern, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:42:09.066 --> 02:42:12.467]  People can go, of course, to Consortium News.
[02:42:12.467 --> 02:42:15.388]  Give us the URL where people can read your great writing first.
[02:42:15.388 --> 02:42:18.409]  Well, it's ConsortiumNews.com.
[02:42:18.409 --> 02:42:22.771]  C-O-N-S-O-R-T-I-U-M News.
[02:42:22.771 --> 02:42:23.951]  One word.
[02:42:23.951 --> 02:42:25.031]  Dot com.
[02:42:25.031 --> 02:42:32.854]  And you'll see not only my writings, but those of Robert Perry, who in my view is the best investigative reporter left in this country.
[02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:35.018]  We'll have to get Robert on.
[02:42:35.018 --> 02:42:36.039]  Ray, talk to you again soon.
[02:42:36.039 --> 02:42:36.699]  God bless.
[02:42:36.699 --> 02:42:37.860]  You're most welcome.
[02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:41.262]  Alright, there goes Ray McGovern and he had cancer that he beat a few years ago.
[02:42:41.262 --> 02:42:43.143]  He just had his CAT scan a few days ago.
[02:42:43.143 --> 02:42:46.506]  He's gonna get the results today of his lymphatic cancer.
[02:42:46.506 --> 02:42:52.490]  Let's pray for Ray McGovern that he continue to be in complete remission of his cancer.
[02:42:54.394 --> 02:43:01.398]  Let's also pray for Charlie Sheen, because when I've known Charlie Sheen, he's been a dignified guy, never seen him drink or do anything.
[02:43:01.398 --> 02:43:07.621]  But obviously, Charlie is having some problems right now, and I've been wanting to tell folks to certainly pray for Charlie Sheen.
[02:43:07.621 --> 02:43:10.143]  And I never even talked about Aaron Zellman dying a month ago.
[02:43:10.143 --> 02:43:14.325]  I should eulogize him, the head of Jews and Preservation of Firearms ownership.
[02:43:14.325 --> 02:43:17.647]  I mentioned it, but I wanted to properly eulogize him.
[02:43:17.647 --> 02:43:20.569]  We all need to pray for each other out there in this world.
[02:43:21.249 --> 02:43:25.876]  Okay, pray for Rush Limbaugh, too, and his OxyContin addictions.
[02:43:25.876 --> 02:43:27.858]  I mean that seriously.
[02:43:27.858 --> 02:43:35.008]  I'm going to spend the balance of the broadcast now dealing with pole shift.
[02:43:36.447 --> 02:43:38.428]  We live on an ever-changing world.
[02:43:38.428 --> 02:43:42.449]  We're hit by comets, we're hit by asteroids, solar flares.
[02:43:42.449 --> 02:43:50.492]  NASA admits if a direct solar flare ever points towards the Earth, it will blow out all of the satellites that are on the sunward side of the planet.
[02:43:50.492 --> 02:43:53.113]  That will cause serious issues.
[02:43:53.113 --> 02:44:01.916]  As we become more and more dependent on technology, pole movements or huge pole shifts, solar storms will affect us.
[02:44:01.916 --> 02:44:03.797]  And the sun is the biggest driver of climate.
[02:44:04.622 --> 02:44:05.242]  We're good to go.
[02:44:27.481 --> 02:44:34.163]  And the last 50 or so, there's been intense metering of them at stations around the globe.
[02:44:34.163 --> 02:44:43.226]  And you could spend days trying to read all of the NASA reports, Scientific American reports, the list goes on and on.
[02:44:43.226 --> 02:44:48.708]  Fox News reports confirming that the pole is moving and is beginning to shift.
[02:44:48.708 --> 02:44:50.029]  We don't know how much it's going to shift.
[02:44:50.689 --> 02:45:12.887]  Faster than it's ever has shifted since it's been recorded now that isn't as scary as it sounds it could be but we don't know Because we don't know that it doesn't fluctuate every 50 or 100 or 75 years or randomly whenever the Sun goes through different permutations of cycles But if it shifted a few thousand miles Cataclysmic oceans rising
[02:45:15.905 --> 02:45:19.957]  Texas could find itself where the North Pole is if there was a 3,000 mile shift.
[02:45:22.589 --> 02:45:29.351]  If there was a 5,000-mile shift, Texas could find itself basically where Japan is.
[02:45:29.351 --> 02:45:31.172]  I mean, it's unlimited.
[02:45:31.172 --> 02:45:35.013]  And right now, it's moving towards Russia.
[02:45:35.013 --> 02:45:36.334]  And it is moving.
[02:45:36.334 --> 02:45:41.135]  And over the years, I've heard all these scientists and people saying it was going to shift, it was moving.
[02:45:41.135 --> 02:45:44.836]  And there's historians that have studied it and gone into the ancient text.
[02:45:44.836 --> 02:45:47.657]  When things like this were reported, we're going to start looking at it more.
[02:45:47.657 --> 02:45:50.038]  Because I only go off stuff I can prove.
[02:45:51.094 --> 02:45:52.235]  I don't
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:17.228]  Hundreds of planetoids as big or bigger than Pluto, that's why they've delisted it as the ninth planet, because you'd have to count all those others as planets.
[02:46:17.228 --> 02:46:21.954]  In a way, I tend to agree with that analysis, because there's so many.
[02:46:21.954 --> 02:46:23.295]  But the thing is, we don't know.
[02:46:26.158 --> 02:46:36.124]  Now they admit watching the Shoemaker-Levy comet that broke up and hit Saturn, that we probably get hit every, it could be six, seven, eight thousand years by giant asteroids.
[02:46:36.124 --> 02:46:41.227]  They don't know, but they know it's more often than they'd previously thought, every million or so.
[02:46:41.227 --> 02:46:52.014]  We might be able to do something about that with space-based weapons, but then the globalists admit that they want to use it as a cover to weaponize space and turn the weapons back on the Earth, but our technology lets us deal with that.
[02:46:52.014 --> 02:46:53.875]  But our technology is not going to be able to deal
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:01.724]  In the foreseeable future, I mean that's God-like power, with the sun and with its magnetic waves.
[02:47:01.724 --> 02:47:07.769]  And if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we'll put back on screen, pole shift threatens to cause weather chaos.
[02:47:07.769 --> 02:47:16.615]  And that's a, we scroll down a bit, a NASA graphic of the sun and the magnetic waves
[02:47:18.481 --> 02:47:22.682]  of the earth up there at the top of the photo graphic.
[02:47:22.682 --> 02:47:31.024]  You can see basically the charted measured magnetic waves of the earth because the earth obviously is so massive.
[02:47:31.024 --> 02:47:33.564]  It creates some gravitational system.
[02:47:33.564 --> 02:47:39.025]  Then you've got the Van Allen radiation belt and other things that protect us from solar radiation.
[02:47:39.025 --> 02:47:46.607]  Then you have on average in the atmosphere from the upper areas of the atmosphere to sea level on average around 10 feet of water.
[02:47:47.307 --> 02:47:55.550]  If you condensed all the water vapor down, on average it's about 10 feet, there's several inches of rock in the atmosphere.
[02:47:55.550 --> 02:48:03.353]  They condense all the rock, dust, and potash, and volcanic ash, and pollen, and things that are in the atmosphere, and bugs.
[02:48:03.353 --> 02:48:11.016]  Bugs get blown up into the sky, and they found frozen spiders and things that they've tested, and that are thousands of years old that have been out there floating around.
[02:48:11.016 --> 02:48:15.558]  So there's several inches of rock and other particulate that also is a shield.
[02:48:16.058 --> 02:48:17.752]  That the sun has to shoot through.
[02:48:20.578 --> 02:48:25.740]  So we have this article dealing with the full spectrum of what we know is happening right now.
[02:48:25.740 --> 02:48:27.381]  And so yes, it could be quite alarming.
[02:48:27.381 --> 02:48:29.362]  I mean, this could happen.
[02:48:29.362 --> 02:48:32.383]  And it is moving now faster and faster.
[02:48:32.383 --> 02:48:35.625]  Poll shift threatens to cause weather chaos.
[02:48:35.625 --> 02:48:40.287]  Will paying millions of dollars in carbon taxes to Al Gore and his cronies solve the problem?
[02:48:40.287 --> 02:48:49.351]  Because obviously they're saying all this weather and cold weather is global warming and magnetic pole changes are global warming and pay them taxes and it'll fix it.
[02:48:50.171 --> 02:48:57.795]  And Paul Watson's article is very, very important and I think everybody needs to see it.
[02:48:57.795 --> 02:49:01.037]  Again, pole shift threatens to cause weather chaos.
[02:49:01.037 --> 02:49:09.462]  According to some experts, the world's weather is about to get even more chaotic as a result of natural climate change that we can do absolutely nothing about.
[02:49:10.182 --> 02:49:19.471]  Because again, if the poles start moving more, even if the Earth doesn't change its physical orientation, it will change the magnetic fields into the sun and radically change weather.
[02:49:19.471 --> 02:49:27.118]  If the Earth's actual axis changes, which is connected to massive pole shifting, you're talking cataclysm.
[02:49:27.118 --> 02:49:31.762]  I mean, you know, you're talking biblical Armageddon type stuff.
[02:49:33.908 --> 02:49:43.991]  And even though global warming alarmists may exploit the consequences to advance their own political agenda, paying a carbon tax to Al Gore will not lessen the impact of a potentially catastrophic mega-polar shift.
[02:49:43.991 --> 02:49:47.892]  And again, it's being driven predominantly, scientists believe, by the sun.
[02:49:47.892 --> 02:49:59.996]  And in evidence, I bring you some of the reports that I have here dealing with the
[02:50:02.639 --> 02:50:03.921]  Pull shift information.
[02:50:03.921 --> 02:50:06.364]  This is out of Salem-News.com.
[02:50:06.364 --> 02:50:09.849]  Magnetic polar shifts causing massive global super storms.
[02:50:09.849 --> 02:50:11.431]  We'll go back into that after the break.
[02:50:11.431 --> 02:50:12.332]  Here's Fox News.
[02:50:12.332 --> 02:50:16.899]  Magnetic north pole shifts forces runaway closures at Florida Airport.
[02:50:18.624 --> 02:50:23.387]  Again, magnetic North Pole shift forces runway closures at Florida Airport.
[02:50:23.387 --> 02:50:29.271]  The planet's northern magnetic pole is drifting slowly but steadily towards Russia, and it's throwing off planes in Florida.
[02:50:29.271 --> 02:50:32.453]  It had basically been in one spot, moved a bit, but now it's moving faster.
[02:50:32.453 --> 02:50:33.894]  Tampa International Airport was forced to...
[02:50:35.655 --> 02:50:46.785]  Re-adjust its runways Thursday to account for the movement of the Earth's magnetic fields, information, and informing the pilots who rely upon to navigate their planes.
[02:50:46.785 --> 02:50:55.952]  Thanks to the fluctuations in the force, the airport has closed its primary runway until January 13th.
[02:50:55.952 --> 02:50:58.895]  And this happened back in early January, right when those birds died.
[02:50:58.895 --> 02:50:59.836]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.385 --> 02:51:05.489]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.489 --> 02:51:09.993]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:16.159]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.159 --> 02:51:18.581]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.581 --> 02:51:24.547]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.667 --> 02:51:28.070]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:29.931]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:29.931 --> 02:51:32.133]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.133 --> 02:51:36.997]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[02:51:36.997 --> 02:51:37.817]  Guaranteed!

[02:52:02.085 --> 02:52:06.129]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.129 --> 02:52:09.373]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.373 --> 02:52:14.178]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.178 --> 02:52:20.565]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.565 --> 02:52:22.808]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.328 --> 02:52:24.809]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:24.809 --> 02:52:25.929]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:25.929 --> 02:52:28.350]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.236 --> 02:52:49.526]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:05.097 --> 02:54:07.138]  We'll talk more about pole shifts tomorrow.
[02:54:07.138 --> 02:54:12.061]  I'm going to go a little bit into the next hour to continue getting into this, because I promised I would.
[02:54:12.061 --> 02:54:14.463]  But tomorrow we'll open the phones up, dealing with it.
[02:54:14.463 --> 02:54:16.224]  We're going to get some guests lined up.
[02:54:16.224 --> 02:54:19.426]  His listeners just keep wanting me to talk about this and pointing it out.
[02:54:19.426 --> 02:54:24.289]  And there is some serious changes happening with the Earth's magnetic field.
[02:54:24.289 --> 02:54:26.350]  All the nukes, they detonated in the upper atmosphere.
[02:54:26.350 --> 02:54:27.651]  Did that have an effect?
[02:54:27.651 --> 02:54:29.913]  Does all the weather modification and HAARP have an effect?
[02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:33.442]  Well, none of that has any power compared to the sun.
[02:54:33.442 --> 02:54:40.226]  And we know the sun has been doing a lot of strange things in the last few years.
[02:54:40.226 --> 02:54:42.628]  Before I get back into that, a few other news items.
[02:54:42.628 --> 02:54:49.413]  Yesterday, I tried to call the number, the public number for See Something Say Something for Homeland Security.
[02:54:49.413 --> 02:54:52.314]  And it just went to a voicemail.
[02:54:52.314 --> 02:54:54.656]  Boy, the terrorists are supposedly everywhere and about to get us.
[02:54:54.656 --> 02:54:58.298]  We've all got to give up our liberties to be safe, but they're not answering the phone.
[02:54:58.298 --> 02:54:59.960]  So I called the FBI in Dallas.
[02:55:01.921 --> 02:55:09.968]  Uh, and I said that today I was planning to call a bunch of agencies live on air and bring up real evidence of terrorism being staged by elements of the government.
[02:55:09.968 --> 02:55:11.429]  I will do that tomorrow or the next day.
[02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:22.258]  I've got to look at the schedule of guests and things, but I'm going to spend much of an hour, uh, calling and, and, and, and see something, say something, you know, a report on the criminality in government and that's what our
[02:55:22.938 --> 02:55:24.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:27.742]  Video contest is about.
[02:55:27.742 --> 02:55:32.727]  It'll be complete in a few weeks, so be sure to make your videos or do your entries.
[02:55:32.727 --> 02:55:33.647]  $10,000 prize, by the way.
[02:55:33.647 --> 02:55:34.108]  First place, $7,000.
[02:55:34.108 --> 02:55:35.269]  Second place, $2,000.
[02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:36.490]  Third place, $1,000.
[02:55:36.490 --> 02:55:38.972]  The V for Victory campaign is separate.
[02:55:38.972 --> 02:55:39.913]  Incredibly successful.
[02:55:39.913 --> 02:55:48.581]  People are going wild with that, having a huge effect, pointing out that we're in a police state and that we don't like it, and huge solidarity being caused by that.
[02:55:49.591 --> 02:56:03.541]  And I got so focused on other issues, I didn't really get into the big news of the White House responding to us on Friday with our report about globalist energy policy causing blackouts whenever we have peak consumption due to cold weather.
[02:56:03.541 --> 02:56:07.423]  But obviously we'll be talking more about that as that story continues to unfold.
[02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:11.606]  And I shot a video that's got about 100,000 views on our YouTube channel.
[02:56:11.606 --> 02:56:13.607]  It's 15 minutes long, breaking that whole thing down.
[02:56:13.607 --> 02:56:18.311]  It's called Alex Jones Calls Out Obama for Treason.
[02:56:19.401 --> 02:56:25.274]  And so I hope that everybody will get that video and send it on to others so they understand what treason is.
[02:56:25.274 --> 02:56:28.882]  This is economic warfare against our country.
[02:56:30.097 --> 02:56:34.940]  But the fact is they've had GPS for decades and haven't had on aircraft.
[02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:36.721]  The publishers had it the last 10 years or so.
[02:56:36.721 --> 02:56:40.003]  They haven't had to really change them because of magnetic changes.
[02:56:40.003 --> 02:56:43.485]  And that shows how much the pole has already moved.
[02:56:43.485 --> 02:56:48.007]  And the last two years it's been accelerating in the north towards Russia.
[02:56:48.007 --> 02:56:50.909]  There's also movement, big movement in the south.
[02:56:50.909 --> 02:56:59.154]  And that is our shield, our force field, blocking out a lot of the sun's solar wind, solar radiation.
[02:56:59.154 --> 02:56:59.774]  And, uh,
[02:57:01.297 --> 02:57:02.500]  It is scary.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:06.308]  It is scary, but the only thing that's constant is change.
[02:57:07.793 --> 02:57:20.839]  There, of course, is the cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis, is the conjecture that there have been rapid shifts in the relative positions of the modern day geographic locations of the poles and the axis of rotation of the Earth.
[02:57:20.839 --> 02:57:22.079]  Yeah, that's the big one.
[02:57:22.079 --> 02:57:31.103]  If we physically change our orientation of the sun, I mean, the US could end up where Chile is, or Chile could end up where Australia is.
[02:57:31.103 --> 02:57:32.504]  That is, in the orientation of the sun.
[02:57:32.504 --> 02:57:33.985]  I mean, you name it, it could happen.
[02:57:34.845 --> 02:57:37.449]  And there's a lot of mainline scientists that say that this is the case.
[02:57:37.449 --> 02:57:39.952]  There's not just little changes, there's big ones.
[02:57:39.952 --> 02:57:46.379]  But even a slight magnetic change, again, affects how the winds of the sun are hitting the earth.
[02:57:46.379 --> 02:57:51.506]  Not just the solar radiation, but the overall magnetic winds.
[02:57:53.089 --> 02:57:59.315]  Such a dynamic change could create calamities such as floods and tectonic events, earthquakes.
[02:57:59.315 --> 02:58:18.331]  This type of event would occur in the physical poles, had been or would be suddenly shifted with respect to the underlying surface over a geologically short time frame, because the tectonic plates, it's not just the planet moving in its orientation to the sun, it's the plates themselves floating around.
[02:58:20.746 --> 02:58:21.607]  How thick's the crust?
[02:58:21.607 --> 02:58:22.707]  7, 8, 9 miles?
[02:58:22.707 --> 02:58:27.110]  And then the rest of it is molten rock!
[02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:30.513]  I'm gonna come back and do five more minutes on this.
[02:58:30.513 --> 02:58:30.853]  It's clear.
[02:58:30.853 --> 02:58:32.774]  I probably gotta do a whole show just on this.
[02:58:32.774 --> 02:58:34.115]  Multiple shows.
[02:58:34.115 --> 02:58:39.038]  And really burrow into it because something's happening to the poles, something's happening to the Earth's magnetic field.
[02:58:39.038 --> 02:58:44.121]  Stay with us.
[02:58:44.121 --> 02:58:47.143]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.143 --> 02:58:48.164]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.135 --> 02:58:52.316]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:58:52.316 --> 02:58:59.240]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:58:59.240 --> 02:59:01.802]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:59:01.802 --> 02:59:07.166]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:59:07.166 --> 02:59:10.228]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:10.228 --> 02:59:12.289]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:12.529 --> 02:59:18.774]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:18.774 --> 02:59:22.157]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:22.157 --> 02:59:27.942]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:59:27.942 --> 02:59:29.584]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:29.584 --> 02:59:30.885]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:59:30.885 --> 02:59:33.387]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.547 --> 02:59:37.769]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:37.769 --> 02:59:42.390]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:59:42.390 --> 02:59:44.971]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:59:44.971 --> 02:59:48.853]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:59:48.853 --> 02:59:51.994]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:59:51.994 --> 02:59:55.575]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.575 --> 02:59:58.777]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.545 --> 03:00:16.587]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:16.587 --> 03:00:25.713]  I'll continue breaking this down on the show tomorrow and a lot of other powerful and informative guests joining us throughout the week as well.
[03:00:25.713 --> 03:00:27.475]  My riders Aaron Dykes,
[03:00:28.929 --> 03:00:33.853]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Kurt Nemo and others are on fire.
[03:00:33.853 --> 03:00:36.375]  Steve Watson has a big report at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:36.375 --> 03:00:39.178]  We'll make sure it gets up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:39.178 --> 03:00:47.545]  AOL and the Huffington Post team up to provide a perfect blend of sanitized news content and celebrity gossip slop.
[03:00:47.545 --> 03:00:50.467]  Anything of any worth is ignored or censored.
[03:00:50.467 --> 03:00:53.309]  There's also the George Soros angle.
[03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:55.691]  That he's hooked up with the Huffington Post.
[03:00:55.691 --> 03:01:00.913]  Now the Huffington Post is to run all of AOL's news.
[03:01:00.913 --> 03:01:04.115]  The new editor of AOL News is Arianna Huffington.
[03:01:04.115 --> 03:01:09.838]  So it's more of a merger, not just a buy-up of the Huffington Post for 315 mil.
[03:01:09.838 --> 03:01:12.639]  So that report is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:01:12.639 --> 03:01:15.621]  Good job to Steve Watson on that report.
[03:01:15.621 --> 03:01:17.702]  Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis.
[03:01:19.281 --> 03:01:32.834]  And it goes on to say that scientists have found that in Earth's history that there is a, quote, polar wander of one degree per million years.
[03:01:32.834 --> 03:01:35.878]  But, you know, they didn't say it was every million or so an asteroid hit us.
[03:01:35.878 --> 03:01:39.501]  Now they know it could be every few thousand, every 6,000.
[03:01:39.501 --> 03:01:40.442]  Between approximately
[03:01:41.703 --> 03:01:52.769]  790 and 810 million years ago, when the supercontinent Rodina existed, two geographically rapid phases of true polar wander may have occurred.
[03:01:52.769 --> 03:01:55.931]  In each of these, the Earth rotated 55 degrees.
[03:01:55.931 --> 03:01:58.692]  That's massive.
[03:01:58.692 --> 03:02:01.954]  Again, this is just scientists thinking that this happens, but this is respected.
[03:02:01.954 --> 03:02:06.636]  I mean, this is, they admit that there's evidence of this going on, but they're trying to say, don't worry, it was 800 million years ago.
[03:02:08.865 --> 03:02:11.926]  You know, don't worry, it was 200 million years ago.
[03:02:11.926 --> 03:02:19.468]  The geographic poles of the Earth are the points on the surface of the planet that are intersected by the axis of rotation.
[03:02:19.468 --> 03:02:36.013]  The pole shift hypothesis describes a change in the location of these poles with respect to the underlying surface, a phenomenon distinct from the changes in axial orientation with respect to the plane of the elliptic that are caused by the precession and movement.
[03:02:36.013 --> 03:02:36.173]  So...
[03:02:37.958 --> 03:02:46.684]  And you add all of that with government increase in monitoring of this and opening new facilities around the world to study it.
[03:02:46.684 --> 03:02:54.528]  I've got a press release here by the British Geological Survey, South Atlantic Anomaly and South Georgia Magnetic Observatory.
[03:02:55.589 --> 03:03:02.132]  And they're talking about all these new anomalies they're picking up and how they're building new facilities to track it.
[03:03:02.132 --> 03:03:05.594]  Something I'll get into tomorrow is out of nasa.gov.
[03:03:05.594 --> 03:03:16.099]  We actually covered this when it came out in 2008, but they've discovered that there are these magnetic pathways or portals
[03:03:18.396 --> 03:03:24.802]  Where the magnetic fields of the Sun and the Earth are actually joining and creating types of magnetic wormholes.
[03:03:24.802 --> 03:03:28.925]  Where there's all different types of variants and connections.
[03:03:28.925 --> 03:03:29.846]  Really heavy stuff.
[03:03:29.846 --> 03:03:31.908]  Magnetic portals connect Earth to the Sun.
[03:03:31.908 --> 03:03:35.331]  That's the NASA headline.
[03:03:35.331 --> 03:03:36.772]  Here's Scientific American.
[03:03:36.772 --> 03:03:39.114]  Satellites.
[03:03:39.114 --> 03:03:41.316]  Spy changes to Earth's magnetic field.
[03:03:43.919 --> 03:03:48.462]  And they say, though the process can take nearly 5,000 years, the Earth's magnetic field periodically reverses.
[03:03:48.462 --> 03:03:55.527]  According to a report published today in Nature, scientists may have detected the beginning of the field's next such reversal.
[03:03:55.527 --> 03:03:59.250]  And that's where all the freak-outs started back in April of 2002.
[03:03:59.250 --> 03:04:04.614]  That's where this article is from, out of Scientific American.
[03:04:04.614 --> 03:04:09.117]  And now here we are, nine years later, and it is accelerating its shift.
[03:04:09.117 --> 03:04:10.178]  And so it could happen.
[03:04:11.892 --> 03:04:14.033]  I mean, it could happen.
[03:04:14.033 --> 03:04:18.414]  And that could be why the globalists are gearing up so much of this police state stuff as well.
[03:04:18.414 --> 03:04:23.676]  I mean, I've always tried to poo-poo 2012 and the rest of it, but obviously this is going to have to be looked at.
[03:04:23.676 --> 03:04:28.778]  But even if you don't get tectonic, massive tectonic movement,
[03:04:30.194 --> 03:04:35.156]  Or a overall change in the Earth's angulation to the sun.
[03:04:35.156 --> 03:04:42.579]  There's the issue of the Earth's magnetic field shifting and its orientation of the sun in massive weather shifts.
[03:04:42.579 --> 03:04:49.803]  And that's what Paul Joseph Watson's article deals with in great detail.
[03:04:49.803 --> 03:04:56.386]  And so I hope people will check out that article at PrisonPlanet.com and get it out to everybody.
[03:04:56.386 --> 03:04:58.526]  Paul's shift threatens to cause weather chaos.
